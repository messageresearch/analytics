you can have your seat we have sister megan for a testimony and a song that's okay [Music] our brother um preaching he's not here tonight is he this morning oh brother our minds was getting excited and going off his notes and um oh it's okay thank you i'm plugged in uh it's just it's gonna hurt i appreciate [Music] about coming to church and he said we should be asking god what god wants of us and i was i was really feeling it so i closed my eyes for a moment and said oh god what do you want from me um and i uh i was sitting there in the divine energy for about five seconds and i think i was actually feeling confident to feel something uncomfortable like and i think if i heard something uncomfortable i might have really listened to it like if i had a it's very important to wear a skirt and not just on sundays i think i might have actually done it um but instead the uh the feeling that i had immediately after that was maddie groves uh with some emotional content i'm going to translate as maddie graves is going to be epic at megros is the name of the song i was working on at the time that i was getting ready to record the next day and i was actually feeling really doubtful about whether that was a good song or not um and so that was just it was just two words but i did a lot of unpacking of those two words and i think in a broader sense i'm going to translate that as saying uh your works are acceptable um and even like if i go if i go extending beyond that a little bit i could say yeah your clothes are acceptable um just uh just just do that frog music project so um after all that i'm definitely not going to sing maddie groves because it is epic it was epic i went down and recorded it it was miraculous but it's not a church so i'm not going to do it today i'm just going to play um a couple of little fin tunes um because i'm um i'm learning to feel the divine energy through my violin around here and maybe a little less doubtful but my works are acceptable so it's just a little tune called sleep russell which is a place known in ireland and uh [Music] me [Music] me [Music] me [Music] [Music] uh [Music] you [Music] it oh [Applause] thank you megan that was very nice i love those modes i love those melodies and they're very beautiful what where was it from again what's the island yes i love that yeah there's a band robin mark and he sings um these

lord at all times amen he says let your moderation be known to all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing for everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus amen and we're gonna sorry we read verse um and and finally brethren whatever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things amen those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the peace of god shall be with you amen amen praise the lord who wants that today amen amen praise the lord and we're going to isaiah 26 and we're going to read verses 1 to 4 here not in isaiah 26. and then then you can have your seats after we read this isaiah 26 and verses 1 to 4 amen if you're there say amen praise the lord we are here it says in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah we have a strong city salvation god will appoint for walls and bulwarks open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee trust you in the lord forever for in the lord jehovah is everlasting strength amen may the lord bless his word you may have your seats this morning i want to take a opposite title you know we've been talking about the oh it's great to have vicky here as well god bless you great to have you here uh yes i won't ask the question that i'll ask after i normally say that but we'll see him one day praise the lord give our love and regards to paul please amen thank you um so i want to take so i've been taking these last few sundays about the devil's mental health crisis but i want to take the opposite now of the peace of god and the bride i mean because we live in a troubled world but the trouble shouldn't be in us amen that now we know that there'll be uh you know to have the peace of god does not mean we are void of trouble right we're always we are living in a time of trouble and so there may even be trouble in our minds but in our hearts i trust is a peace that passes all understanding amen because we live in an hour where god has given as brother brahm would preach a couple of sermons shalom and he wasn't just saying something to say it but he was making a declaration of the peace of god is now upon the bride of christ gross darkness covers the people but the light of god has risen upon thee and his glory is seen upon me so we live in an amazing hour where there's trouble in the world but we can walk around in perfect peace now brother brown makes a statement very familiar quote one of my favorites from um i think it's from the message uh he swore by himself he said jesus christ no matter if he was in a storm and the gale was knocking and the boat from one side to the other or he was standing in a face a mess of demons if he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right on just as calm as quiet he as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him that's right whether it was going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knowed it was going to happen because god said so he didn't say oh have i prayed through i wonder if i fasted long enough i wonder if i did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed that god said what god said was truth the word must be fulfilled and he know that his life was to fulfill them that's right and you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world walk as you walk in christ walk with him not paying any tension the right or left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with god hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with god amen if your neighbor don't like you walk with god just keep walking on with god enoch one day walk like that you know what he done amen he walked all the way home with god just got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen walk with god the doctor says you're gonna die walk with god yeah the doctor says well walk with god just walk with god that's all for god has promised you i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you to the end of the world he took an oath and by that covenant that he give you that he would confirm it just walk with god then you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you've got to go through briar patches over sharp rocks over bluffs down over the hillsides up through the mountains over waters but walk with god yes sir there's so many hills to climb upward you've heard the old song but how little it'll seem when we get to the end of the way my my just look at there all that's been look back at your footprints it won't be very much amen so if sickness strikes you don't worship your sickness just walk with god it doesn't mean you won't have any sickness but just walk with god don't worship your trouble don't let the trouble be the main thing in your mind i mean just walk with god see some people you know we have a hard week we come to god i mean come to church we sit here like a piece of stone because of what the week's done to us but god's never done that to us god's always been good just fair loving kind understanding and i don't come to church to worship my problems i come to here to worship god right so i'm not going to let my problems dictate to me how i'm going to worship god and walk with him no i'm just going to walk with god i mean so it didn't matter what jesus was facing he walked unconscious of it it didn't mean he put blinkers on and ignored it he just walked with god i mean because he knew he was here to fulfill the word right and we're here to fulfill it too and brother braham says that nothing can take you from the earth until god's purpose has been fulfilled in your life it doesn't matter how close you get to death whatever happens nothing can take you until your purpose is fulfilled i mean so that should give us such a peace i mean it doesn't matter what we are facing in this life right now amen i believe we're going to pack out the victory i mean we're going to walk through it amen because god has not finished with us and if he has finished with us praise the lord i get to go to be with him amen amen so you can't lose one of my favorite quotes brother brother brown says you can't lose being a christian you just can't lose right you win either way amen amen so praise the lord so we can we can rejoice excuse me that we have a peace that passes understanding now i said the peace of god that he has given to us is not making us void of trouble or hardships or problems so he doesn't give us a peace where there's no trouble right because some people think you're gonna live up in the bush and there's nothing around you but tranquility and then you've got peace no no you can be living in this rat race of this world and have a perfect peace and and that's the kind of peace god gives us amen we'll get into that more now jesus it says that he would he would be you know isaiah would prophesy of him coming and he'd say in isaiah 53 and 3 he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hit us at where our faces from he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne out griefs he has carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted so he was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief he knew grief but he wasn't he didn't he didn't have a spirit of depression upon him he wasn't a depressed person right though he is a pardon me a man of sorrows acquainted with grief that did not stop him fulfilling the word of god in his life he did not have a depressed heavy spirit though he was a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief why because he walked with god amen so we shouldn't let things in life drag us down but we should walk with god you know the peace the peace that passed all understanding that the lord will give us now i think um if we can go to john now i don't know why i put page numbers on these notes what's the point i kind of jump everywhere but if we go to john 14. now i don't know if i'll be very long this morning but some you know some letters you get in the mail aren't very long but i just want you to really have a real i i trust it would anchor in your heart it's not us pushing pulling trying to get it's god's going to carry us through right it's not whether we hold on it's whether he holds on right and he's going to hold on because his grip is the most powerful grip in the world right so we don't need to be all flusterated in life we need to look unto the lord because our help comes from him now we read there we'll get to john sorry but i just want to go back to isaiah there because he says that he will give him perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon him because he trusteth in him can we put that verse up could we go back to isaiah uh 26 and 1 and we just i just want to go through this a bit because look our piece is based on our trust has god got it has he got my life has he got your life if he's got your life you can rest yeah man right you can actually have confidence hey he's got this so the problem is too complex now let's go down now um we could go into this but see this oh no so let's go back there right this is the song that'll be sung in the land of judah i'll say this is the song that should be sung in the land of the bride we have a strong city salvation will guide a point for walls and bulwarks that's defenses so he's going to make salvation at our defense see the enemy comes against you said no no i'm saved god god save me i've come based on the requirements of his word i've come god's provided away amen by receiving the blood of jesus christ repenting giving my whole life being baptized in his name i've received the holy ghost i fulfill brother abraham says that that that that a um full obedience to the full word of god entitles you to the token now and then he says that that full obedience is acts 2 of repentance being baptized remission of sin and you shall receive the token amen that's full obedience to the full word of god right so who's done that has anyone gone through that right so now we have salvation as our defense right so if we're saved we can't be lost if you're really saved you can't be lost i mean let you be a defense no the lord is my helper he's my strength he's my shield what can the enemy do against me what can man do against me if god is on my side amen and we know that anything that happens and for to us is for our good all things work together for good those that love god are called according to his purpose romans 8 28 and i trust that should be a foundational strict scripture of our life that this is whatever you're going through right now we could go from here to the back and there'd be everyone's going through all different things but if you if you love the lord and are called according to his purpose it's working for your good you may not understand the current why there but it's working for your good why because i trust it's driving you closer to the lord and as you yield yourself to the word you yield yourself to him and makes a character who makes his character form a new more so it's working for your good right because the people he's going to rapture off the earth is the people he sees himself and he sees his own character of nature he sees his word manifested amen let's go to the next verse there amen open ye open you the gates of the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in now we know that truly in this hour the only way you keep the truth is if the truth is in you and the truth is a person it's not a bunch of collection of arguments and ideas no i am the way the truth and the life of the lord jesus said so if the truth is in you you'll keep the truth you can't help it amen praise the lord let's go to the next verse who's enjoying the bible i am i mean that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on thee and what's the qualifier because he trusteth in me rise is not just a mental strength saying i'm going to keep my mind on the lord i'm going to no no because he trusteth in thee that's why his mind has stayed upon him right that's why he's kept in perfect peace because there's a full trust god has got this god is in control we can rest if this is all you get out of this service i mean you could just take this to the rapture right because god god has got your life amen right he had it before you met him and you'll have it now as you walk with him and he'll take you all the way praise the lord so that's why he gives perfect peace because our minds are stayed on him because we trust in him amen if he's revealed himself to you you can trust him he did not reveal himself to you for you know he didn't do that to push you down in a hole somewhere saying you're no good nothing no he reveals himself to his people to lift them up liberate them from the bondage of sin and death and unbelief in all the devil's devices i mean that they can act because what does he want to do he's always wanted a relationship he's wanted a love relationship with the people that's what he's always desired from the beginning down through so so he reveals himself to you because he wants a relationship with you it's not just one way traffic of him doing all the talking or you doing all the talking no no it's a it's a communion communion is he talks to you you talk back that's my lord you have a relationship amen and so so he allows us to go through things in life because he wants to build a trust he trusts his own word he has full confidence in his salvation right but he needs you to have that same confidence how do you get that confidence by going through things that he builds he proves his word in every trial hallelujah amen you take moses going you know taking the children of israel out of egypt to the promised land what happened through that whole journey god proved himself over and over again they were stuck in bondage he liberated them from egypt they came to the red sea he opened the red sea they were thirsty he gave them water they were hungry gave them food you know they the enemies came against them said moses lift up your hand you'll win the battle yeah they came to came to the jordan he opened the jordan came you know came to jericho he tore jericho down you know went through conquered the land god proved himself over and over again that he went through the judges and the people of israel forgot him yeah god would come to gideon different ones reveal himself deliver them and then say hey god's true he's faithful amen and it's the same thing with us we're lost in sin bondage of all kinds of crazy stuff god liberates us hey god's a savior we can trust him you get sick he heals you oh god's a healer he builds trust and love in your life for him amen and what does that do that allows our mind to be stayed upon him and it builds a perfect peace in your life if he pulled me out of one thing he's gonna pull me out of another right if he healed me here i believe he healed me there he he met my needs there he'll meet my need here what he's the same god amen hallelujah and it's not something we earn it's just something he does because he wants to praise the lord so remember it's not a reward scheme you know like a coffee card you get the tenth one free kind of thing it's not well i've done this enough lords therefore i get a miracle here no it's not how it works it's god's sovereign grace is i'm going to put myself into your life i'm going to prove my word in your life over and over again hallelujah amen now yes so we're in john now are we yes we are all right now john 14. i hope that's really what i was going to here we are john 14 26 yes thank you very much i'm glad we have a listening audience right here john 14 and 26 he says about the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you amen so when the holy ghost comes into your life he brings the word to your remembrance right he's the inside teacher we need the inside teacher i mean peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your hearts be troubled neither let it be afraid so he says the peace i'm giving you is a different one to the peace in the world now peace in the world is based on circumstance it's on you know people i've never seen people stressed if they're doing well materially i've never seen someone anxious and nervous and stressed because their bank account's got a whole bunch of money in it you know their mortgage is paid off they've got no debts who's seen that i know it sounds ridiculous but who's ever seen someone no it's normally a financial crisis brings a stress but there's peace people now this is the world's peace right if everything's provided for people have peace or people have peace because there's no trouble in their life they're going through a good patch there's no worries like people are normally relaxed on holiday why because all the cares of life and their job and stuff they just kind of you know put it to one side they're going on holiday they're all of their responsibilities kind of are not as heavy on them anymore right right but you see so the world thinks that's the kind of peace well that's the kind of peace the world gives right so things are going well there's no sickness there's no worry in the family no no job stress nothing that's that's kind of the world's peace but the lord says no i'm going to give you a different peace and this piece is actually far greater remember the lord gives far greater anything the devil gives is just a cheap copy and a perversion of what god has and the and the reality of what the lord has is far greater than the perversion like i remember i was brother andy was there too you were at a camp and i was i was literally i felt drunk on the spirit of god and it was awesome but there was none of the perversion of the wickedness that i know was like to be drunk in the world this was the same kind of drunk feeling but none of the perverse sin with it yeah right and so i just realized man being drunk on the spirit's way better amen than this cheap copy that the devil tries to pull down people's throats that's right that means it's not like the lord takes away things and you know then there's nothing to it no no god has far greater amen but you need to taste and see that the lord is good amen amen and you'll see his you're being addicted to the spirit of god it's the greatest addiction you can ever have i mean you never wake up in the morning and say man i can't believe i did that it's like praise the lord i want more there's no regret there's no man oh why why'd that happen you know no there's no shame hallelujah hallelujah so the peace he gives is far greater amen see brother brahm says unto whom shall we go he says true peace true peace is where you know by revelation that your sins are all taken away you'll pass from death unto life and if this breath is your is the last one in your body so this is actually me you've got an eternal body waiting in the heavens already that you'll step into that's true peace right true peace is knowing that amen and then brother says he is the only eternal happiness and joy and peace what more could i say he's the only eternal joy eternal happiness eternal peace my peace i give unto you not as a world give i unto you let your hearts not be troubled he is the only peace and the only happiness oh you might laugh like a loon you might go into some hysterics over some movie start cracking a joke or something but what is it it's only making a noise that soon wears off and a few minutes will all be gone but when a man has come to a place where he has found about me that the joy there is in the knowing that his sins are forgiven that he is dead and his life is hidden god through christ sealed by the holy ghost it's joy unspeakable and full of glory and the power of the eternal god knowing that you're resting securely in his love and grace that's a real peace it's not based on circumstance it's not based on bank accounts or money or whatever no no because all those things wear off a joke wears off comedy wears off but a lasting piece i mean he said this is the kind of piece i'll give you it's an eternal peace amen it's an eternal joy it doesn't wear out it doesn't get old hallelujah amen this is this is the piece he says again into the key of the door he says key to the door he says there's only one daughter peace yeah he says my peace i give unto you he's there he's the only one daughter genuine peace you might think you've got peace you might accumulate enough money to buy your house you might accumulate enough money to get your children's clothes have food to eat but you might have accumula you might have accumulated enough popularity to be popular among people but when you slip off your shoes at night and get ready to lay down there's only one thing that can give you peace that is if you know that you're dying that night there's only one piece and that is jesus is the peace he is our beast it's like when brother bosworth was passing away and you know he was in his final moments you know and and brother brown asked him when's the greatest time of your life now a lot of people in the world would think well in my 20s or my prime of my youth but he said right now is the actually the greatest time that's going to happen to me because he says the one i've loved for all these years is going to walk through the door and take me home hello going to take me to glory he was looking for the lord to take him he said that was the greatest moment of his existence was that moment why because he had a peace that passes all understanding i mean greater than his being up in age and pains and hurts and whatever more but he was looking for that's why a christian's always looking forward we're not here to look in the rearview mirror and say well i wish i was back in 10 20 years no i want to live right now this is the greatest moment of my life is right now hallelujah because why because i'm closer now than i ever have been to the coming of the lord i mean the one that i've loved for these years i'm looking to carry me home amen hallelujah amen praise the lord amen that's a real peace that passes understanding now hello yeah i i i hope you agree with me on that one hallelujah amen because this life is just a vapor soon it will be gone and where will we be well we're going to be on streets of gold come join me it's going to be awesome hallelujah it's going to be awesome amen now we've got to have a trust that god is able to keep his word he wants you to know that he doesn't just want to be in here he wants to be anchored in his in your heart that this word and if i had the message it's the same right because the message reveals christ in the scripture right now she can't differentiate between the two but you see now but god keeps his word if god is given a promise he has never backed up on any single promise there's never been a time in history where the conditions have got too hard for his word to be fulfilled right never in the never in the history of man when god will bring a promise and the devil kind of guesses well i guess it's about now just like you know he could see that israel was in egypt 400 about you know it was coming to the time the 400 years and the delivery was going to come so he inspired pharaoh to throw all the boy babies in the nile to kill them all you know to try and stop the deliverer coming it didn't get too hard god didn't say actually thus saith the lord the conditions have changed and i guess this can't happen no it went on all the same amen it went on all the same moses was born he was hit by his parents he was actually raised in pharaoh's house raised up there just to tear it down hallelujah you know it's amazing the enemy sheltered the deliverer that was going to destroy his kingdom hallelujah amen and here we are in this day this world sheltering us but we're going to tear it down amen hallelujah we're going to go into a rapture then there's going to be a great tribulation amen but you know so so there was no never a time in history where things got too hard for god to fulfill his word he has never ever backed up on a promise and because he is able to keep his promise it may look impossible to man but nothing's impossible to god god is the perfect orchestrator he will get his word fulfilled right on time but he but he wants you to know that right he doesn't he knows that but he wants you to know that he wants you to be deadly sure god you're a man of your word you cannot lie you cannot back up you couldn't you know he never says well oh sorry i was just embellishing that know what he says he means and what he means he does amen so i trust and that's how we can entrust in him we say lord you're a man of your god of your word and you've never backed up on your word amen hello you know jesus went to calvary with one scripture that he'd come out of the grave one scripture in isaiah where he says i'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption neither will i leave his soul in hell that was the one prophecy he went to calvary where there was a revelation in his heart he knew he couldn't stay there in the grave he was coming out amen hallelujah so by one promise amen the resurrection took place but he knew that that was going to be fulfilled brother ramsay is here he says he knew that he must be crucified he knew he must suffer the innocent for the guilty he knew that he would raise from the grave on the third day pardon me he knew that there wasn't no powers that could hold them in the grave because the word of god said i'll not suffer my holy one to seek corruption neither will i leave her soul in hell and there was no powers that could break that prophecy his word shall be true and they will be fulfilled in their seasons and he had confidence that what the father had said the father was able to keep his word amen so he knew there was no powers that could break that prophecy so there's no powers that can break the prophecy of a rapture it's going to happen doesn't matter what the devil puts on the puts on the world amen no there's a people that are going to be translated from this world to the next world amen so you know god's going to have a bride in this day nothing's going to stop it nothing can stop that prophecy being fulfilled hallelujah but we as i said we need to have that revelation god is going to see us through now jesus uh in in john 10 he was going to be stoned because he said he was god right so in john 10 34 jesus answered them says this is not written in your law i said ye are gods if i called them gods it's amazing how he said i said i thought that was interesting when i was reading it last night is it not written in your law i said yeah gods so basically saying i said in the law yeah gods if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken amen so so now i just want to take that last part of that verse and the scripture cannot be broken now broken has quite a few meanings and part of it means to a null or to subvert to do away with to deprive of authority whether to uh whether by precept or act to declare unlawful to loose that which is compacted or built together to break up demolish destroy um you know metaphorically to overthrow or to do away with now the lord said scripture cannot be broken but it doesn't mean the devil tries doesn't try to break it right so now the devil will try and break the scripture in terms of he'll try and annul it so basically say no there's nothing to it to subvert it to do away with it to the private of authority so basically he just dilutes it down that was just man's words and that was just paul paul wrote that or moses wrote that or james wrote that or yeah paul wrote there to god you know you know there's a lot of you know there's a whole movement within christianity which basically says throw out the writings of paul right because it was just him and he was a pharisee just complicated things and all the but if you take away his writings you take away the rapture because he wrote of a moment a twinkling of an eye will all be changed but there's many things that you know even even peter said that the writings of paul are hard to understand as but and he said as the unlearner do they wrestle with that and the rest of the scripture so peter had a revelation sure maybe what appears to be complicated to some but he put it on par with the rest of the scripture yeah you know so i'll just go with brother peter and say amen amen and i've seen god fulfill what was written through paul but we know it true a true believer knows that the bible is god's inspired word amen right so its authority is above all things amen amen but the devil try and make it so it's man's opinion it's been translated too many times all that kind of stuff but if god is a god of his word don't you think he can keep his word he can still give us a pure word that will produce what it promised to produce in 2022. i mean he'll try and declare it unlawful he'll try and break it up to demolish it but that is just you know but that's not just in society or in public opinion that's in your mind he'll try and do that see the devil will try and reason the scripture away trying to undermine its power and authority but we need to look into the scripture and see what did what what power and authority did jesus give the scripture now he would he would speak in in luke chapter 16 i don't have it in my notes we wouldn't read it but the same time and he'd tell the story of a certain rich man and the bigger lazarus now he said that they both died and the rich man found himself in hell and torment and lazarus was in paradise which was called abraham's bosom now i like it how it actually says maybe maybe actually i just want to put this verse up because i want you to see it um we're going to go to luke 16. i wasn't going to read this but i just like this one bit because this just really shows you know should should our you know the devil can't snatch us after we die we are safe and secure to our destination i mean so let's go to luke now now when jesus said a certain rich man he wasn't just making up a story he's saying this actually happened right and we know brother graham ties us to the rich young ruler um who because it was rich as he wasn't willing to sell all take up his cross and follow the lord now we are going to x i mean sorry luke and luke 16 and to the end of the um to the end of the yes let's go luke 16 and 22 i just want that one verse so it came to pass the bigger died and was carried by the angels into abraham's bosom so i like that so in other words lazarus had had an angelic escort to his destination hallelujah so from this world to the next world i don't know how it works exactly but from this world to the next world there were god's angels saying i'm gonna carry this one amen i'm gonna carry this soul to his final destination hallelujah said don't you think now god will see us through amen not just in this world because you know we don't we have never we've felt influence upon our lives when the holy ghost comes down that's heaven reaching down brother and says it's like your theophany bumping into you telling you when you're wrong and things will come at time it won't just be a bump it'll be it'll be a full impact it will merge one to the other will be gone hallelujah that's why it's so important that the spirit of god moves but you see we felt the effect of there but we've never been there so now there's a question how we're gonna get there well i just read these angels are gonna carry me hallelujah so i've got an angelic escort see in this world we've got an angelic escort god's angels are here to minister to the ears of salvation to actually protect us watch over us they walk with us the holy ghost god himself is within us he says the angel of the lord and camps about those that fear him and that's even many people say that's the angels of the lord now that's true but it's the angel of the lord god himself and angelic foreman camps around you amen you have the best security detail in existence the fbi whatever they've got nothing on this they're sas they've got nothing on what you've got that's around you 24 7. that's right hallelujah and and if this like if this day is my last day upon the earth you say where is he gone i'll say well angels have taken me home hallelujah so do you trust it do you trust him amen should give you perfect peace god's got this whole thing it's all wrapped up now where were we oh yes yes we were um so yeah thank you you can take that down but you see now um the rich man he appeals to abraham says you know send lazarus with a bit of water on his finger then he can dip it in my tanks and be tormented and abraham says no there's a gold fix between you can't come here he can't go to you hallelujah have you saved you're saved right i always take the good side of these things amen if you're under the blood you're under the blood amen but then but then he says well send lazarus to my brethren because you know i've got five brothers all however many it is he says i don't want them to go here but then abraham said no they have the law and the prophets that's enough so basically he is saying that that the word they have in their house has the power within it has the authority within it to take them that they don't have to go to where you've gone they can go to glory amen that's that's the power that jesus put on the word that they had received now that was just the old testament law how about the new testament how about the full revelation of jesus christ amen hallelujah amen so the word has power within it if it's received into a heart of faith it will change you from lost or found it will change you from sinner to saint it will change you from unbeliever to believer hallelujah it will change you amen from from one of doubt and flusterations to a heart of faith where you actually have a piece of god that passes all understanding hallelujah amen hallelujah so i like that we have an angelic escort i just wanted to put that in because i enjoyed that last night hallelujah amen now amen so we should we should think the same this word that we've received amen if it's received in a heart of faith jesus would say in john 5 and 24 fairly fairly i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life so someone who and that word hereth means an understanding it's been revealed so it's not just hearing as in here many people have heard the word but it hasn't changed their lives but those that god opens their heart that it becomes a revelation right what happens they actually and and so god gives them faith then they actually have everlasting life now what we don't receive eternal life there we receive it here right so we're actually walking around if you're a real believer with the holy ghost you actually have eternal life in you possession right now it says and shall not come into the co into condemnation that with congress is is the judgment so they shall not go to the right throne judgment they cannot go there hallelujah this is so simple but don't let it pass over your head because you're the devil remember salvation is our as our walls and our bullworks it's our it's our defense the devil says there's no way you're going it says no it's too late devil you turned up too late to tell me this because i've already met the lord so it says here they have everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life they have right now and to me this is a bright scripture this is not just a say a sinner's prayer you've done it no it's when the lord reveals himself to you and you actually get a real faith not a human faith but god's faith god reveals the word to you it becomes a living reality it changes you because a revelation changes a person moses was a defeated 80 year old shepherd on the backside of the desert but when god spoke to him in the burning bush it became a revelation and he went down to egypt the same place he reigned from and conquered the whole place to deliver the people of israel why because it became a revelation amen amen amen that's right hallelujah amen so when it's revealed to us actually i have passed from death unto life amen i've already done that yeah hallelujah amen shouldn't that give you a peace that passes all understanding when you think upon those things amen praise the lord i like that very much amen so i can't go to the white throne judgment because i i i won't go to the condemnation we just let off the pressure amen just enjoy the lord amen just enjoy being a christian just love him worship him give him glory don't be all tangled see see i heard an um convincing concern brother ram said you know man makes god complicated right but god makes it simple so let's not let the devil make it complicated in our minds no god's simple he rather he brings it so it is simple you know so and i thank the lord that means i can understand you know but god makes it so simple that actually no you you can't miss it because he doesn't want you to miss it but he wants you to rest in his salvation hallelujah he wants you to rest in it he wants you to have confidence in him amen so when they so when the word now as i said about the word it's not just the written word of god right we know that the bible's infallible doesn't matter what people have done to it it's infallible right but then also the spoken word in this day when you hear the voice behind the voice it illuminates the scripture and illumina it actually turns the light on and you begin to see hey i'm not just here following a religion this is not a religion if you want religion there's a door go find it somewhere else no we're here to have a true relationship with the lord jesus christ that's what christianity is when you meet him he talks to you you talk back to him you walk with him you form a relationship and it's a love affair it's not a fear your god wants to take away all fear all doubt all worry it should be so far from our mind am i gonna make it no that should be so far away amen god wants you to know you've already made it amen amen if you have the holy ghost now you may think it's a bit strong but if you really have the holy ghost if he's really sealed you into the kingdom you've already made it that scripture of john 5 has already been fulfilled in your life you've already made it what about my ups and downs you have your ups and downs what about my hard days you have your hard days what about trials you have your trials right you have all these troubles what about my sin all these things if you confess your sin he is faithful and just to forgive you that's how powerful i believe that's a powerful scripture hallelujah amen you confess it lord i'm wrong i did this forgive me lord he's faithful and just his side of it as well i've got to forgive you right if it's from a heart of faith a genuine sincere heart a real repentance he has to forgive you because he says he's faithful and just do forgive amen he doesn't leave it in the cupboard when he gets grumpy you did this five million years ago you did this the other day no no no it's in the sea of his forgetfulness he doesn't remember it amen so when the word has really revealed it to you nothing can throw you from it amen as you give me a pic remember i'm when we have a piece of past understanding i'm sure i've already said it doesn't mean we'll be we won't have any mind battles yeah right we'll have mind battles right we're not walking in some nirvana state where there's no trouble in here no there will be trouble but there's a piece in here that passes understanding okay so just because you may be going through a mind battle that doesn't mean you're not a believer right just because sickness you know some people think well i've got enough faith that'll keep sickness away from you like a bug spray or something no it doesn't work that way actually when you go through a trial it's because god has found you faith has found favor you found favor in the sight of god the prophet says that's why you go through a trial my lord praise the lord so i i know i hope you're not thinking i hope i never find favor with you guys no we want to find favor but it's because he has made you accept it in his presence amen it's not anything we earn amen amen and god keeps his word amen that's the word of god where i rest not whether i jumped whether i shouted whether i spoke with tongues whether i had oil in my hands whether i preached or what i'd done i'm resting on that promise satan can beat me around the stump on my feelings but he count on the word amen because it's thus saith the lord that's where jesus defeated the devil right there says it's written man shall not live by bread alone stay with the word amen amen hey it's true hey he can beat us all day long with our feelings that's right i know i've had a lot of experiences there but you gotta walk no don't walk with your feelings walk with god right you feel down don't walk with it down walk with god god is an upper he's not a downer god is a stabilizer right so walk with god amen amen hallelujah see now the devil will try and undermine the word at every hand now when he tries to undermine the word he's trying to undermine god in your life that's right so when i say the word i mean in god i'm meaning jesus right because he is his word so now he says in the book of uh says brother brahm in the church facebook he says now remember this christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation the book of revelation shows that how the antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan and and that exposing of satan reveals his works which is the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast a lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely he'll be definitely thwalted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it amen with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them now i just want to break that down if if the true church gets the true revelation of what she is what she stands for and she can do the greater work she'll be the invincible army so i just want to break that down and then and then and then we're going to wrap up so the true revelation of the true church what is the true church it's the body of christ upon the earth right but by one spirit we're baptized into one body so the true church is his body upon the earth right we are his hands we are his feet we are his eyes we're his mouth i meant that if you're part of that body hallelujah if you have the holy ghost you're part of the body of christ it's around the world it's not just in these four walls thank the lord amen amen so so if you get the true revelation actually i am part of him i'm boners bone flesh was full flesh life is life i am part of him just as a husband and wife are one so christ and his bride are one hallelujah amen now now if you're his body it doesn't matter what part of the body you are you are still above the devil amen he isn't convinced and concerned he says but god don't have any little bitty children or great big children they're all children to him that's exactly right and your rightly position is sitting right in heavenly places in christ jesus with every power he said brother brown i'm the least in the church i'm just a little bitty fellow but remember when he ascended on high see you're raised with him you're the body and you're with christ right now seated in heavenly places he says if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil is underneath you hallelujah why because the foot is on the head of the devil she can be the skin on the little toe you're still above the devil he's still under you hallelujah that's exactly right the church where the head is the body is with it hallelujah so if he's been resident heavenly places far above all principality power demon with powers in high places you're there too amen yeah walking upon the earth amen and if we are bare and if we are buried died buried in christ then we are raised with him in this resurrection set in heavenly places in christ jesus with every fire of hell under us amen no matter how little you are every devil's under you amen i trust we got a revelation of the true church right amen we every devil is under you now not one day no the blood puts them under you now glory to god amen our great conqueror has conquered every sin everything every sickness even death itself that's right we are more than conquerors in him one thing we are seated with him and his throne amen that's it it's all there all right jesus hallelujah now what she stands for i'm just going to break this down what she stands for she stands for the truth amen she stands for purity she stands for holiness she stands for deliverance she stands for liberty she stands for the power of god she stands for love joy peace long suffering for faith she stands for the pure underfiled word amen right she stands for the moving of the holy ghost she stands for him having had ship over her that's what she stands for amen she does not stand for just living by an argument amen if you have just an argument that's why you're a christian like a bunch of facts have been put together in your heart that's why you're a christian someone can argue away from it but if it's revealed to you it doesn't matter how good the argument is it won't stand remember a testimony is never subject to an argument right a testimony can never be overcome by an argument because a testimony is an experience of the true and living god an argument is just some reasoning but reasoning can never stand against a true testimony that's why it's so important you must be born again right if you have that true experience then all the arguing of all the atheists in the world can't shake you amen from walking with the lord being a christian amen she stands for the reality of the resurrection of jesus christ now that she can do the greater work shall i probably unpack this a bit more later but we're just going to go this bit here she can do the greater works now that greater works is imparting eternal life says on that day on calvary now notice the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer to cast out devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers i think it's important two believers the holy ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what calvary meant it took stoop the greater men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of god to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the holy ghost to obedient believers is what it means right men who wants unbelievers to be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life how much greater is it to say this sick woman lying here i can pray a prayer of faith and shall be healed that's a great thing but that and but that's what he was doing then but said greater than this shall you do i'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but give me eternal life which will be eternal forever blind poor wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greatest thing is that's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him imparted to others can a man do that he says the son of god can now we look into the scripture how this works hallelujah peter would go to cornelius's house eternal life's going to be imparted amen amen and he would preach on the resurrection preach on the lord jesus take away all the sin preaching what god was doing in their present day and those in cornelius's house believed because peter was a fulfillment of a vision of visitation that cornelius had and so they were under expectation when peter walked into what he was preaching they believed that while yet peter spake these words the holy ghost fell upon them amen amen so what happened eternal life was imparted it's not some magical trick no it's when someone believes what you're saying if god is inspiring you to speak now this is not just a preacher this could be anyone but you're having fellowship with someone and god's speaking through you they believe it the holy ghost can fall upon them amen we can pray with people that they anyone can pray i believe a believer filled with the holy ghost can pray with someone until they receive the holy ghost isn't that empowered imparting eternal life hallelujah amen praise the lord now i'm just going to read one more hallelujah praise the lord now the whole christian experience i'm just going to sum it up with this the whole christian walk is based upon rest it's based upon rest when you really receive the holy ghost you enter into rest you cease from your own works it's not you trying to please the lord if god comes into you and he fulfills his word in your life so it's not what you can push and pull and shove and do no no it's him leading you amen and that what does that do that creates such a faith and a trust hallelujah now you can just rest now that rest does not mean you get lacks no that rest is actually it seems contradictory in a way you're resting but you're pushing amen because you want to press the battle because you see god live you want him to live in other people's lives right but you're resting it's not your own human ability it's what he does now that matters see so like brother braham says that the when you receive the token the holy ghost he says he says now the life that i now live he lived a different life from one from from once he did is not me but christ liveth in me there is the identified token that god required so we're identified with our sacrifice when the life of our lord jesus comes into us we're identified with our sacrifice right the life of our savior and us the holy ghost oh what a positive token there cannot be any more token oh if you could only catch the thought of it if i had power this morning with words to express and place into your soul not in your ears but your soul that you could see the guarantee of it and i wish i could actually do that you could see the guarantee that you've really passed from death to life have you really got the holy ghost you already made it he said it would make you feel so relaxed not lex but relaxed why can you relax because the blood's been applied doesn't matter what the devil does on the outside he can rage all he wants i'm safe and secure i know where i'm going amen and what does that give you that gives you a peace that passes all understanding though you may be in the biggest trial of your life biggest hardship whatever more there's a peace in your heart that reigns amen and you can rest in his word because he's more than able to perform it and you can just walk on praising god amen not worshiping your trouble worshiping the law praising him giving him glory i mean having full confidence he's more than able to perform that which he has promised i'm just going to leave it there because i think we'll we'll pick this up in august maybe let's have the musicians this morning but i i trust you can just look into the scripture say lord you have you you have sorted me out amen you have made a perfect way hallelujah what does he want now from us just worship and praise and thanksgiving amen doesn't matter what's going on in life now just just just put mute on the devil's conversation amen because he's in your ear going but this and this and what about this and this trouble and you're at this age and what's happening here just push me actually just hang up hang up on the devil and block and talk to the lord hallelujah right because the lord has not come to give us a spirit of fear but love power and ability amen hallelujah amen so let's let's stand this morning amen let's sing that song here's our piece where he's broken down every wall we sing that i did i did throw it in the system but it may still be on its way oh here we are amen let's just sing this let's just worship the lord this morning amen i know just a little bit of a thought but let's just if we just meditate if our mind is dead on him because we trust in him he'll give us perfect peace hallelujah amen i mean in this world full of mental health crisis we can have peace it passes
