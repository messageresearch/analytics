[6:30] he was standing out there and he had his
[6:33] bonds all fixed up and everything was
[6:36] just going fine and he was standing

[46:24] Lord today we're going to read mark one
[46:34] down to verse 20 mark 5 so verses 1 to
[46:39] 20
[46:51] so I don't have a slideshow what's that
[46:54] yep was here we are and they came over
[46:56] unto the other side of the sea into the
[46:59] country of the gadarenes and when he was
[47:02] come out of the ship immediately there
[47:04] met him out of the tombs of man with an
[47:06] unclean spirit who had his dwelling
[47:09] among the tombs and no man could bind
[47:11] him no not with chains because he that
[47:13] had been off bound with fetters and
[47:15] change the chains had been plucked
[47:16] asunder by him and the fetters broken in
[47:19] pieces neither could any man tame him
[47:21] and always night and day he was in the
[47:24] mountains and in the tombs crying and
[47:26] cutting himself with stones for when he
[47:28] saw Jesus afar off he ran and worshipped
[47:31] him and cried with a loud voice but I
[47:34] want you to notice who's doing the
[47:35] worshipping as it the manner is at
[47:38] Legion I want you to see just just look
[47:40] at us here and when he saw Jesus afar
[47:43] off he ran and worshipped them and cried
[47:45] with a loud voice saying what have I to
[47:47] do with thee Jesus our son of the Most
[47:49] High God I adjure thee by God that thou
[47:52] art torment me not this is the devil
[47:54] worshiping for he said unto him come out
[47:57] of the man thou unclean spirit and he
[47:59] asked him what is thy name
[48:01] and he said saying my name is legion for
[48:03] we are many and he besought him much
[48:05] that he would not send him away out of
[48:08] the country now there was their high
[48:10] unto the mountains a great herd of swine
[48:12] feeding and all the devil's besought him
[48:14] saying send us into the swine that we
[48:16] may enter into them for as much Jesus
[48:19] gave them leave and the unclean spirits
[48:22] excuse-me went out and entered into the
[48:24] swine and the herd round
[48:26] ran violently down a steep place into
[48:28] the sea there about two thousand and
[48:31] were choked in the sea and they did't
[48:32] feed the swine fled and told it in the
[48:35] city and in the country and they went
[48:36] out to see what it was that was done and
[48:39] they come to Jesus and see him that was
[48:42] possessed with the devil and had and had
[48:44] the legions sitting clothed and in his
[48:46] right mind and they were afraid and they
[48:50] that saw it told them how it befell to
[48:53] him that was possessed with the devil
[48:54] and also concerning the swine so they
[48:56] began to testify of what happened to
[48:58] this man and the result was and they
[49:00] began to pray him to depart out of their
[49:01] coasts and
[49:03] he was coming to the ship he that was
[49:05] possessed with the devil prayed him that
[49:07] he would might might be with him howbeit
[49:10] Jesus suffered him not and south--and
[49:12] him go home to thy friends and tell them
[49:15] how great things the Lord has done for
[49:16] thee and hath compassion on thee and he
[49:18] departed and began to publish and jakka
[49:22] bless or have you say that I don't know
[49:24] how great things Jesus had done for him
[49:26] and all men did marvel I mean this bow
[49:29] heads and a word of Prayer gracious Lord
[49:31] we are so thankful we can be standing in
[49:34] your presence once more Lord to know
[49:36] that by your precious blood we have no
[49:38] condemnation we have no sin Lord you've
[49:40] you've answered that question you've
[49:42] taken all guilt and shame away Lord
[49:45] that's your doing and we rejoice because
[49:46] it's you're doing Lord we're so thankful
[49:48] that no one can boast in your presence
[49:50] no mortal can't declare any goodness of
[49:52] their own selves Lord because we know
[49:54] it's all you Lord salvation is of you
[49:56] who lured our Walkers of you our rapture
[49:58] will be of you as well and dear God I
[50:00] just pray that you'll bless your word to
[50:02] your people now father
[50:03] noid speaker and here one more time Lord
[50:05] what good is it if the people are
[50:07] anointed but I am NOT or if I am
[50:09] anointed and the people are not Lord we
[50:10] must both be anointed so may we be one
[50:13] heart one mind one Accord Lord may what
[50:15] we face tomorrow just be put one Lord to
[50:17] one side you already know what's going
[50:19] to happen tomorrow you're not worried
[50:20] about it Lord so therefore we shall not
[50:22] be worried neither Lord because our
[50:24] lives are in your hands so I asked
[50:26] father may your blessing be upon us now
[50:28] and anoint your word to our hearts Lord
[50:29] may you grant the police Lord in Jesus
[50:31] Christ name Amen
[50:33] I mean God bless you all you may have
[50:35] your seats so it's quite a quite a scene
[50:42] we've read here with speaking of Legion
[50:44] I just wanted to point that out with
[50:46] with with who was worshiping there and
[50:50] we're gonna come back to that but
[50:51] brother brownie says and the message
[50:53] identification he says now may the Lord
[50:56] had his blessings to the reading of his
[50:57] word I'd like to take for a few minutes
[50:59] of your time on what I would call or
[51:02] like to say a text called identification
[51:05] identifying identified in the likeness
[51:08] of Bible characters being identified in
[51:11] the likeness of Bible characters and
[51:13] tonight as I thought an approach to this
[51:15] after we have this
[51:17] begin talking of us coming and how that
[51:19] the church should make itself ready
[51:22] he says I'm sure tonight we ought to
[51:24] find ourselves somewhere in some
[51:26] character of the Bible so that we would
[51:29] know the outcome of that character and
[51:31] know what our outcome will be amen so we
[51:35] want to be identified in the scripture
[51:37] and every man woman and child will be
[51:39] identified in the scripture but it's
[51:42] really what you give yourself to as what
[51:44] you'll be identified and now brother
[51:46] cadre said this at camp and it really
[51:48] blessed me how he said when Abel offered
[51:50] the lamb God could identify himself and
[51:53] that sacrifice because he was a lamb so
[51:55] now if you go all the way through the
[51:57] scripture you can see where God
[51:59] identifies himself with the people now
[52:01] when I when I speak of him being
[52:04] identified it's because he can see
[52:06] himself in that life hallelujah he could
[52:09] not see himself in Cain sacrifice
[52:11] because that was not what God was God
[52:13] was not fruit he was a lamb hallelujah
[52:15] so so now you know so when God can see
[52:19] himself in our lives then he will anoint
[52:21] our lives accordingly
[52:22] so you see Moses Moses went down to
[52:25] Egypt as a deliverer and God could
[52:27] identify himself in Moses ministry
[52:29] because he was the deliverer so he
[52:31] anointed Moses life accordingly
[52:33] to manifest that deliverer and see you
[52:35] can go all the way down through the
[52:36] scripture and you see when man begins or
[52:39] man a woman began to begin to move
[52:41] according to the promise of God God says
[52:43] I can identify myself in that life and
[52:45] he anoints that life the supernatural
[52:47] takes place and God vindicates his word
[52:49] to that person you take like the
[52:51] shunammite woman God gave them the baby
[52:53] supernaturally she couldn't have a child
[52:55] you know and and and and the prophets
[52:57] had to a servant you know she's been
[52:58] good to us look they've built this
[53:00] little room for us here as we journey
[53:02] through and you know what do you think
[53:04] we could do you know to - you're you're
[53:06] in Thanksgiving back you know do you
[53:08] think we talked to the king or whatever
[53:10] more but you know the servants here but
[53:12] they have no children and so now then
[53:14] then the inspiration moved on the
[53:16] Prophet said go tell that woman thus
[53:18] saith the Lord you're going to have a
[53:19] child and she had a son but then it was
[53:22] out with us dead in the field and it got
[53:24] heat stroke you know and you know got
[53:26] sick and it died but that woman now now
[53:28] God
[53:29] is gonna see what the woman was gonna do
[53:31] because God wanted to identify himself
[53:33] in her life again hallelujah so it
[53:36] wasn't just a one time where where
[53:38] because she was good to the Prophet that
[53:39] she got a blessing now God was going to
[53:42] put her under a test to identify herself
[53:44] in his Amit did identify himself in her
[53:48] life
[53:48] I mean said I hear she was she had been
[53:50] given a child by promise but now death
[53:53] had struck the child what was she gonna
[53:54] do she was either gonna bury the child
[53:57] she had a choice you could either bury
[53:58] the child say well that was wonderful
[54:00] but now the blessings God or she could
[54:02] go back to that man of God because she
[54:04] knew that the Prophet God was in that
[54:05] prophet and she knew if I could just get
[54:07] him to that just get my boy to him I
[54:10] mean he can raise him from the dead
[54:11] because the one who raised it did in the
[54:14] past was the same God that was in the
[54:15] Prophet I mean so she said to her a
[54:17] servant said of them you'll what's gonna
[54:19] go get him hallelujah and then the
[54:21] Prophet you know beginning yoga has he
[54:23] or whatever it was the servant looked
[54:24] and saw the Shoom light coming and you
[54:26] know and in the Shulamite said you know
[54:28] it's all well with thee was asked she
[54:30] said all as well she's got a dead son on
[54:32] a bed at home but she's saying all as
[54:35] well why because she's are about to be
[54:37] identified with a resurrection because
[54:39] God was going to look at her life and
[54:40] say I can identify myself in this
[54:43] woman's faith now you've got to
[54:44] understand from the get-go God gives us
[54:46] that faith it's not our own ital that's
[54:49] a nice idea I'll try that all this is a
[54:51] good idea or someone else has tried it
[54:52] no it's not that it's when God moves on
[54:55] your heart gives you the revelation that
[54:57] the word will come to pass then you act
[54:58] upon that then God says I can identify
[55:00] myself in that life
[55:01] olia see you know the rest of story she
[55:04] comes his all as well but when she gets
[55:06] within striking do you're reaching
[55:07] business grabs the grabs his robe and
[55:09] you're helping back you hallelujah God
[55:12] can identify himself on that and that
[55:14] woman's desire to see her son raised
[55:16] from the dead hallelujah so know that
[55:18] and then you know there is a story the
[55:20] Prophet goes to the house lays himself
[55:21] on the child you know who his dead life
[55:23] comes back and the child is restored
[55:27] God moved in a supernatural way cause he
[55:29] got identify himself in that woman's
[55:31] faith a man you can take you know a
[55:33] brother brand when you know he's flying
[55:35] through Memphis and as plane is grounded
[55:37] I mean because you wanna see this woman
[55:39] could identify herself in the scripture
[55:41] she saw her son
[55:43] often to the world she saw her son
[55:45] become sick didn't know what it was some
[55:47] social disease she saw him getting
[55:49] sicker and sicker till eventually he he
[55:51] was lying there basically you know
[55:54] hanging you know between life and death
[55:55] just cried mum it's dark oh it's dark
[55:58] mama you know and and but she was
[56:01] praying and she began to pray Lord Lord
[56:04] I'm like the Shunammite woman she could
[56:06] identify herself in the scripture now
[56:08] this is not how we have many thousand
[56:09] years ago this is this is an our
[56:11] generation she can identify herself with
[56:13] the scripture said Lord you gave me the
[56:15] son now you've got to restore the son
[56:17] and she wasn't necessarily worried about
[56:19] his physical health she just wanted to
[56:21] know that he'd be saved before he went
[56:23] up into the eternity and so she began to
[56:26] pray thank God I'm like I'm like the
[56:28] Shunammite woman where's my Elijah
[56:30] where's my prophet hallelujah and God
[56:33] had the prophet oh you're in the place
[56:35] the plane was grounded not because of
[56:37] the prophets faith it was that woman's
[56:39] faith caused the storm I mean which
[56:41] caused the plane to be grounded
[56:42] hallelujah that same faith is in your
[56:45] life if God reveals you who you are in
[56:48] the scripture then how they overcome
[56:50] their outcome will be your outcome and
[56:52] her outcome was God gave a revision when
[56:55] she was praying she'll brother Bram
[56:56] walking down the street so before dawn
[56:58] she was there on her sitting there you
[57:00] know leaning on her gate waiting he's
[57:03] coming
[57:03] where is he and she was laying there and
[57:07] their brother Burt and then now God
[57:08] begins to act on both ends the planes
[57:10] grounded brother says why let's go for a
[57:12] walk or whatever he decide to do and
[57:13] then the Lord the oh he's just looking
[57:15] some some shop Lord says start walking
[57:17] just start walking
[57:19] it's quite a distance from where that
[57:21] was to where she lived it's quite a bit
[57:23] he just walked keep walking down into
[57:25] that color district this is and then
[57:27] finally he's walking past she's leaning
[57:28] on the fence because why the one that
[57:31] God showed was coming was walking down
[57:33] was more than a vision now the visuals
[57:35] becoming material hallelujah it's the
[57:37] same thing with you and I when you see
[57:39] this when you see yourself identified in
[57:40] the word I mean you know it's not just
[57:42] me to stay as a vision it must become
[57:44] flesh so here she comes
[57:46] or he comes down and she just says good
[57:48] morning parson he says good morning
[57:51] aunty as they would address each other
[57:52] and well how did you know as a parson
[57:54] they begin to talk but then she said you
[57:57] but where's your where's your suitcase
[57:59] he lifted in the hotel see then then
[58:03] then you know she's invite summon tells
[58:06] the story he says I've been in King's
[58:07] palaces but there was nothing like this
[58:09] god bless our home on the your front
[58:12] door it's a little shotgun house but he
[58:14] said this is far greater than apalis and
[58:16] he says now you pray and then he said
[58:20] you could tell she knew who he was who
[58:23] she was talking to well I'm just talking
[58:25] to the ear something no she knew him
[58:27] that's the main thing you got to know
[58:29] him hallelujah and then and then brother
[58:32] BAM prayed and then he just forget to go
[58:34] it's getting like mama it was not his
[58:37] prayer it was her prayer that brought
[58:40] her son that was going to be lost died
[58:43] lost to be come back to life again her
[58:46] faith you know we got to understand
[58:48] we're living in an age of an anointed
[58:50] people it's not just an anointed profit
[58:53] or anointed minister it's now an
[58:54] anointed people I mean just like we read
[58:57] about I mean I mean brother ed was
[58:58] saying about killing the Philistines and
[59:00] you know I was reading the scripture you
[59:02] know David came to a point where he
[59:04] couldn't kill Giants no more he got too
[59:06] old but then others rose up to take his
[59:09] place so the next generation rose up to
[59:12] finish off the Giants that David was
[59:13] meant to kill he picked up five stones
[59:15] when he crossed the brook to face
[59:16] Goliath why'd he pick up five because
[59:18] because Goliath had sons and brothers
[59:20] there are other Giants in the land that
[59:22] had been destroyed hallelujah but David
[59:25] didn't do the job the younger generation
[59:26] did it so when from anointing on one man
[59:28] committing police' now we're living in
[59:31] age of an anointed people not United
[59:33] ministry anointed profit now anointed
[59:35] people police are the same anointing on
[59:37] the prophets on you probably the same
[59:38] anointing on Jesus Christ is on you how
[59:41] the same life those in him as on you
[59:42] hylian you're going to recognize who you
[59:44] recognize what's in you I meant take
[59:46] honor his word whatever you do don't
[59:48] shrink back and say someone else to do
[59:50] it no you do it
[59:51] holy that's when you come to a place
[59:53] where you recognize no one else is going
[59:55] to stand I'm going to stand I'm going to
[59:58] take God at His Word
[59:59] I'm going to play those Philistines
[1:00:01] hallelujah Jenga recognized that he was
[1:00:05] a circumcised Jew God could identify
[1:00:07] himself in his life that's why when he
[1:00:10] ran jumped out the windows we heard this
[1:00:12] morning with an ox code Georgia I can
[1:00:14] identify myself in your life Holly and
[1:00:17] supernaturally he killed every one of
[1:00:19] them why cos God said I can identify
[1:00:21] myself in that kind of a life I mean he
[1:00:24] wasn't rich he didn't have servants he
[1:00:26] had nothing but he knew he as a
[1:00:28] circumcised Jew standing is in his
[1:00:30] inheritance that was enough brother Ram
[1:00:34] said it's the same thing with you know
[1:00:35] all the Devils on my back I got these
[1:00:36] problems that's going on you want to
[1:00:38] recognize your son and daughter of God
[1:00:40] standing in the land standing in your
[1:00:42] inheritance hallelujah and you're gonna
[1:00:44] recognize that is enough hallelujah
[1:00:47] doesn't matter what the devil fights you
[1:00:49] with you gonna recognize who you are and
[1:00:51] don't ever just think oh really no
[1:00:53] really hallelujah Amen you we go down
[1:00:59] over all the way down through the
[1:01:00] scripture God identifies himself
[1:01:03] supernaturally because he can see
[1:01:05] himself in the life so you can say no so
[1:01:09] everything we do everything all in
[1:01:12] everything in word or deed do the name
[1:01:14] of Jesus Christ right way because God
[1:01:17] wants to identify himself in your life
[1:01:19] in everyday life not just in church this
[1:01:22] is actually the least amen Wednesday
[1:01:25] night whenever whenever there's no
[1:01:27] everyday life as when the word puts on
[1:01:30] flesh I mean so everything we do
[1:01:33] everything we wear we say how we treat
[1:01:36] one another how we treat our family how
[1:01:38] we treat our children God should be able
[1:01:40] to look down and say I can identify
[1:01:42] myself in that life hallelujah I can
[1:01:47] identify how we speak to other may your
[1:01:49] speech be seasoned with grace with sure
[1:01:51] yes sir how you speak to other God sure
[1:01:54] so I can identify myself and what
[1:01:55] they're saying and anoint that word to
[1:01:56] that person probably how we treat one
[1:01:58] another preferring one another in love
[1:02:00] God you better look out and say I can
[1:02:02] identify myself because I see myself
[1:02:04] living in those people
[1:02:06] hallelujah it's how it should be
[1:02:09] help us Lord right man
[1:02:14] that's why I say Lord that yeah that's
[1:02:16] why we're gonna die daily - if you can't
[1:02:19] live at the same time I will be you or
[1:02:21] the Lord who do you want to live I know
[1:02:23] if I'm living it's a train wreck you
[1:02:26] must just drive off the cliff it's not
[1:02:28] always gonna end badly but I don't mean
[1:02:30] that as a joke but you know humanities
[1:02:32] fails people are we gonna sort this out
[1:02:35] no we're not going to sort out nothing
[1:02:36] God's got to sort it out
[1:02:38] amen hallelujah no but so with Legion
[1:02:46] Legion God could not identify himself in
[1:02:49] legions worship because it wasn't the
[1:02:52] man worshiping it was the devil it's
[1:02:54] amazing when you look into the story of
[1:02:57] Legion it's only in Mark's Gospel where
[1:03:01] it actually identifies that Legion
[1:03:03] worship God Legion worship Jesus and we
[1:03:06] know Mark's Gospel that's under that ox
[1:03:08] anointing it just goes into the works of
[1:03:10] John the Baptist and Christ all works
[1:03:11] works works that's how it's a that's how
[1:03:13] the gospel is written so so it says the
[1:03:17] only account and the Gospels of the
[1:03:19] deliverance of Legion were it says that
[1:03:20] the Legion of Devil's and the man caused
[1:03:22] him to worship God we have to be very
[1:03:26] careful we see people worship God but
[1:03:29] what's worshiping as it as it is it the
[1:03:34] Holy Ghost in them as in a sincere heart
[1:03:36] or is actually a devil
[1:03:38] pretending to worship because if we're
[1:03:40] not careful we're not careful it can
[1:03:43] actually be an unclean spirit and
[1:03:44] someone worshiping God and it's not ours
[1:03:48] at this I trust the Lord just makes us
[1:03:50] come down the middle right because the
[1:03:52] life at the end that'll produce what the
[1:03:54] worshipers it's the life of the end it
[1:03:57] was very obvious with Legion he was
[1:03:59] cutting himself in the tombs naked crazy
[1:04:01] demon-possessed
[1:04:02] here it comes to fall down and worship
[1:04:04] God so it's very obvious there's
[1:04:06] something wrong with this man because of
[1:04:07] the life he's living right but then you
[1:04:10] bring it into our circles and people can
[1:04:13] dress right people can can act right
[1:04:16] they can quote right they can quote the
[1:04:18] scripture you're the devil can out quote
[1:04:20] any
[1:04:21] every language under heaven he can quote
[1:04:23] the message to you and the scripture and
[1:04:25] it can be 100% exactly right but he
[1:04:28] can't live the life he can never produce
[1:04:30] life in the word he cannot do that but
[1:04:32] the believer by the blood of Jesus
[1:04:34] Christ can Amen and that's when God can
[1:04:37] identify himself in life
[1:04:39] I mean it's when his life is and you say
[1:04:41] well I fail many times we're prone to
[1:04:44] failure we're human right the only day
[1:04:47] the moment we will stop failing is the
[1:04:49] moment these bodies change
[1:04:51] hallelujah right that's why we need a
[1:04:54] blood that's why we need a high priest
[1:04:55] that's why we need a mediator amen for
[1:04:58] every moment up till then we need one
[1:05:00] because we're prone to failure because
[1:05:03] we're human but in the same token it
[1:05:07] that's very different someone who's you
[1:05:10] know to Legion in that state because the
[1:05:14] life after the worship what is it amen
[1:05:18] you're with me now
[1:05:22] so Legion here here is Legion I just
[1:05:26] want to show you how demon power works
[1:05:28] Legion became isolated he lived in the
[1:05:31] tombs and in the mountains he was so he
[1:05:34] surrounded himself with death isolation
[1:05:38] crying to himself and cutting himself
[1:05:41] this is demon spirits where someone
[1:05:45] becomes isolated now to be isolated
[1:05:48] doesn't mean you go live up in the
[1:05:49] mountain somewhere be hermit you can be
[1:05:51] isolated even in the service right now
[1:05:53] you can be isolated in your family you
[1:05:57] can be you know you could be living in a
[1:05:59] boarding school nones abundance you'll
[1:06:01] hear but I've been there but you can be
[1:06:02] isolated living with 70-yard boys in a
[1:06:04] boarding school amen you could be in a
[1:06:07] very big family and be isolated why cuz
[1:06:10] that's what demon powers do they try and
[1:06:12] isolate I mean because when the body
[1:06:15] comes together there's a part of God
[1:06:17] part of God comes in the bonfire God
[1:06:19] comes down deliverance can happen that's
[1:06:22] why it tries to isolate us out how does
[1:06:24] the isolate us in here and our thoughts
[1:06:27] no one cares about me no and understands
[1:06:29] me these people don't accept me you know
[1:06:32] what happens Pearson becomes
[1:06:34] isolated Amen people surround themselves
[1:06:37] by death now and back in my day we had
[1:06:40] the goth culture and then the emo
[1:06:43] culture people dress in black lots of
[1:06:47] death and skulls and it's just evolved
[1:06:48] to something else what's happening
[1:06:51] people are anointed with death they
[1:06:53] isolate themselves we had a lot of
[1:06:55] especially the rock bands in my dates
[1:06:56] all this teenage angst you know no one
[1:06:59] understands it you know that's how it
[1:07:03] was because what's happening is the
[1:07:05] devil because what happens is when
[1:07:07] people go through any change in life
[1:07:09] especially when teenagers become adults
[1:07:11] is such a massive change so now you're
[1:07:13] actually working out Who am I because
[1:07:16] you actually go you making a transition
[1:07:17] from from from being as part of the
[1:07:19] family transitioning to becoming an
[1:07:22] individual and eventually you make a
[1:07:24] transition from being part of a family
[1:07:26] to making your own family but it's at
[1:07:28] in-between time it's always the
[1:07:30] transition time which is the difficult
[1:07:31] time and then so now you're so now
[1:07:34] you're getting frustrated because you
[1:07:36] want to grow up and become an adult and
[1:07:38] you are but then your parents are a
[1:07:41] certain way because they have to protect
[1:07:42] you you look at the you look at nature
[1:07:46] do like any herd animal do they let the
[1:07:49] little little newborns just run off they
[1:07:52] don't just go right off into the savanna
[1:07:54] enjoy the great you know kruger just go
[1:07:57] they don't the big ones are protecting
[1:08:01] the little ones because the little ones
[1:08:04] have probably never experienced a lion
[1:08:05] before they've never ever experienced a
[1:08:08] hyena pack or cheetahs or a leopard one
[1:08:11] they've never experienced it and it and
[1:08:13] their mummy and daddy could say you know
[1:08:15] now son there's something called a lion
[1:08:19] what made this big mark on the ground
[1:08:21] that's a lion poor whatever you know
[1:08:26] you know and and but then even though
[1:08:29] the chart the little one could see that
[1:08:31] they don't know what a line can do and
[1:08:33] the description of the line by the
[1:08:36] parents never matches the actual lion
[1:08:38] right and sometimes what could happen
[1:08:42] it's a little one now I was there too my
[1:08:44] parents moved overseas I was in boarding
[1:08:47] school they moved overseas what did I
[1:08:49] begin to think my parents don't
[1:08:50] understand me they don't care that was
[1:08:52] me as a teenager we've all been there
[1:08:55] before and I really thought that did
[1:08:58] they did they not care about me no they
[1:09:00] loved me they cared about me but that
[1:09:02] was what I got in my mind then what
[1:09:04] happens then you don't you can't talk to
[1:09:07] them well who are you gonna talk to talk
[1:09:09] to your peers and I just want to maybe
[1:09:12] just drop a bomb your peers don't have
[1:09:14] the best advice Solomon's son when he
[1:09:19] was being gonna be made King the the
[1:09:22] elders in the country said make the
[1:09:23] taxes and the burden lighter on the
[1:09:25] people this is the ones who with Solomon
[1:09:27] the older ones but he talked to us as
[1:09:29] his peers to the same age and they said
[1:09:32] not Tek some more what happened the
[1:09:35] nation split because he listened to the
[1:09:37] wrong advice you gotta be kidding you
[1:09:41] can't experience you can't read you
[1:09:43] can't learn experience from reading in a
[1:09:45] book or watching it on YouTube or
[1:09:47] whatever you have to experience it to
[1:09:49] have experiences so you've got to
[1:09:51] actually realize you know that US older
[1:09:54] ones we've been through a few things and
[1:09:57] we've been through what you're going
[1:09:59] through it's just been rebranded like
[1:10:01] spark is still Telecom different logo
[1:10:06] different name does the same thing and
[1:10:08] the devilry brands he went from the
[1:10:10] Beatles to like the Rolling Stones and
[1:10:12] Led Zeppelin and all the way down
[1:10:14] through to other we to to whatever's out
[1:10:16] now same devil just rebranded
[1:10:20] you see yeah what's her name Lady Gaga
[1:10:22] we I I had an interview on her and she
[1:10:25] actually had posters of like different
[1:10:27] different artists that were older than
[1:10:29] her that she admired she put them up in
[1:10:31] a room and prayed make me crazy she
[1:10:34] wanted to draw the inspiration that that
[1:10:36] they had and become greater than them
[1:10:38] and what happened prayer answered why
[1:10:44] because just rebut the same devil
[1:10:47] rebranded amen now you can even take the
[1:10:52] same thing in the sports world you can't
[1:10:55] compare people try and make all the best
[1:10:57] rugby team in history
[1:10:58] you can't take people from a generation
[1:11:00] ago and put them with the players today
[1:11:02] they would never ever be in the they
[1:11:04] wouldn't even be in the squad they're
[1:11:06] smaller they're weaker they're not as
[1:11:08] skilled amen you take okay so we had
[1:11:14] John Kirwan who who knows John Kirwan
[1:11:16] this is now I'm just showing where my
[1:11:19] era there's John Cohen he had the fend
[1:11:22] he had that fend Jonah Lomu picked up
[1:11:24] the same friend basically push the guy
[1:11:27] in the face as he's trying to tackle him
[1:11:29] John a lot John Kirwan was way smaller
[1:11:31] than John Loma but he used the same
[1:11:34] tactics because he drew inspiration from
[1:11:36] that that player that was the generation
[1:11:38] before what happened he drew from it
[1:11:40] became greater now why are you saying
[1:11:44] these things you have to be careful what
[1:11:46] you're looking at you ought to be
[1:11:49] careful what you're actually saying I
[1:11:51] want to be like right and us and and
[1:11:54] it's like the young ones and like the
[1:11:57] elephant herd or whatever heard the
[1:11:58] young ones are protected by the adults
[1:12:00] because the adults know what a lion is
[1:12:02] I'm going back to that story they've
[1:12:03] seen it they've experienced a lion
[1:12:05] trying to kill them they know what it's
[1:12:07] like and we know what it's like for a
[1:12:10] devil to try and kill us amen we know
[1:12:13] what suicide suicidal thoughts like
[1:12:16] depression is like I know what that's
[1:12:18] like I know it's a you know drinking and
[1:12:20] you know being having alcohol poisoning
[1:12:22] all terrible I know what it's like I
[1:12:24] know what that Devil's like to try and
[1:12:26] kill me
[1:12:27] amen and we and you could identify any
[1:12:29] anything under the Sun even religious
[1:12:32] pride sure there's that Devils
[1:12:34] to kill some of us trying to think with
[1:12:36] something awesome that's just a devil
[1:12:37] Chyna stop us what we mean what we mean
[1:12:40] to be holier-than-thou kind of attitude
[1:12:42] legalistic Pharisee that's a spirit and
[1:12:45] it will try and get you for Ken but to
[1:12:48] hear about it and to fight against this
[1:12:50] two different things fighting against
[1:12:53] you know mind battles and things spirits
[1:12:55] trying to come in I know what it's like
[1:12:57] cuz I've seen that lion but how God is
[1:13:00] greater than any any demon power
[1:13:02] anywhere anytime hello
[1:13:05] peer pressure I know what that's like to
[1:13:07] overcome hallelujah try just uh I've
[1:13:11] just got to fit in we're gonna fit in
[1:13:14] where are you gonna fit in because your
[1:13:16] friends will probably go become friends
[1:13:18] with someone else and where are you
[1:13:19] gonna be I just want to fit in with the
[1:13:21] crowd you know I probably told this
[1:13:23] before but one of my best drinking
[1:13:25] buddies at yuning I was at I was at so
[1:13:29] forth forum what's fourth forum nowadays
[1:13:31] year ten yet in here here's one of my
[1:13:35] mates a boarding school that I went to
[1:13:36] another school then he came to the same
[1:13:38] university as me I don't know we were
[1:13:39] the best buddies best drinking buddies
[1:13:43] the Lord got ahold of me and then the
[1:13:47] next time I didn't tell him anything
[1:13:48] about next time I saw him you know
[1:13:50] I said you know we're in the supermarket
[1:13:53] and it's like he didn't want to spend
[1:13:54] another second in my presence I didn't
[1:13:57] try and pour pour the gospel down to
[1:14:00] sort nothing well what happened well I
[1:14:03] don't know we were he found other
[1:14:05] friends I just got dropped my friends
[1:14:09] left me so you gotta be careful who you
[1:14:12] tried identify identified the Lord Jesus
[1:14:14] Christ amen he'll see you through well I
[1:14:17] just got to prove myself I just proved
[1:14:21] yourself with the Lord let him prove
[1:14:22] himself to you rather a means a legion
[1:14:25] became isolated crying in the tombs
[1:14:30] cutting himself why people try and
[1:14:32] alleviate the pain and the misery they
[1:14:34] earn by doing all sorts of stuff people
[1:14:37] get tattoos because it means something
[1:14:38] about some past something or they cut
[1:14:40] themselves or people do that today
[1:14:42] where's that from this it's actually a
[1:14:46] tormenting spur cuz there's no peace
[1:14:47] in here because somehow the doors come
[1:14:50] open pain or something's happened and
[1:14:53] the devil steps into that pain and says
[1:14:55] now I'm gonna make room I'm gonna come
[1:14:57] live in this place and then it just gets
[1:14:59] worse and then he says come buddies this
[1:15:01] room for us all you know we say well we
[1:15:05] just gone through some stuff and
[1:15:06] actually many times it's just demon
[1:15:08] powers try to have preeminence in our
[1:15:09] lives trying to take over you've got to
[1:15:12] recognize that's not me I mean something
[1:15:16] that makes you feel useless worthless no
[1:15:18] place anywhere that's not you and it's
[1:15:21] certainly not God that is not the Lord
[1:15:23] Jesus Christ one but that's a demon
[1:15:26] trying to rob you of your life you've
[1:15:28] got a you've got to identify what it is
[1:15:31] and it's not you saying that it's
[1:15:33] actually a devil amen I've seen that
[1:15:38] lyin
[1:15:40] but you got identify for us and it
[1:15:42] doesn't mean you're an unbeliever what's
[1:15:45] the first thing comes and the devil
[1:15:46] comes them or something and they said oh
[1:15:48] you just don't have it because of this
[1:15:50] oh no we have to fight everything we
[1:15:57] have to overcome something right you
[1:16:00] have to overcome the Lord remember he
[1:16:01] was to identify himself in your life so
[1:16:04] he's gonna give you things to overcome
[1:16:05] because he wants to manifest his
[1:16:08] overcoming power and you hallelujah
[1:16:13] now Legion brother brownie says and from
[1:16:20] that time he says as a maniac one day up
[1:16:24] and get her who was cutting himself and
[1:16:26] they bound them and changed and
[1:16:27] espousals ten times an ordinary man
[1:16:29] could break the powers of them chains
[1:16:31] you know we have changed today people
[1:16:34] try and cope with things and they're
[1:16:37] about this big it's a pill nothing wrong
[1:16:40] if you've got to take them but don't let
[1:16:43] it stay that way just to make something
[1:16:44] dormant you get rid of it they meant
[1:16:48] those things help but don't just say
[1:16:50] well this is means the rest of my life
[1:16:51] is just how it has to be as I trust this
[1:16:54] is coming out okay I'm for medicine but
[1:16:58] God is the healer
[1:17:00] sometimes you just got to give God
[1:17:02] something to work with right because
[1:17:04] sometimes because remember God God is
[1:17:07] not a cookie cutter when David killed
[1:17:10] Goliath with a slingshot
[1:17:11] did he use that again no sir God came
[1:17:15] this so he killed the line in the beer
[1:17:16] angle either with a slingshot after that
[1:17:18] he never picks up a slingshot again he
[1:17:20] has a sword right and God shows them
[1:17:23] different ways to fight different
[1:17:24] enemies because god that's why God is
[1:17:26] sometimes he just incident like
[1:17:28] instantly answers your prayer God heal
[1:17:31] me of this gone hallelujah your faith
[1:17:34] has risen but then he wants to show you
[1:17:36] that's not the only way I'd do it
[1:17:38] because I want to mold character into
[1:17:40] you faith worketh patience rides and
[1:17:42] sometimes you may even get the same
[1:17:44] sickness Lord heal me I fear I have the
[1:17:47] same faith that's like there's nothing
[1:17:49] and you wait and there may be someone
[1:17:52] comes along and says well how's your
[1:17:55] diet it's God working you got to be
[1:17:58] sensitive to God working you know maybe
[1:18:00] you got to change your diet or maybe you
[1:18:02] need to go see the doctor
[1:18:03] oh yeah and then you slowly get better
[1:18:07] or you come forward and get prayed for
[1:18:09] lay hands upon the sick and they shall
[1:18:11] recover or your parents pray for your
[1:18:13] soul embrace you lay hands on the sick
[1:18:14] they shall recover and you slowly get
[1:18:16] better it's the same God working in
[1:18:20] different ways amen
[1:18:24] so there was a maniac one day gather us
[1:18:27] I'll just read this again who was
[1:18:28] cutting himself and they bound him and
[1:18:30] changed and his power was ten times an
[1:18:31] ordinary man could break the powers of
[1:18:33] them chains I always thought if he was
[1:18:36] so perfectly under the influence of the
[1:18:37] devil when the devil takes hold of a
[1:18:39] person and saying it makes men and men
[1:18:42] to hold him he breaks them chains
[1:18:45] completely surrenders the devil if he
[1:18:48] could break chains how much more could
[1:18:50] we break completely surrender to God how
[1:18:53] much more powerful is God's power than
[1:18:55] the devil's there he was this poor
[1:18:57] maniac and he was always out there in
[1:19:00] the graveyard cutting himself with
[1:19:02] stones and attacked everybody but one
[1:19:05] day he met God things changed for him
[1:19:06] after that he was clothed in his right
[1:19:09] mind why he had met God a leper stood by
[1:19:12] the gate begging one day
[1:19:13] hmm excuse me one day Jesus Nazareth
[1:19:16] passed by and said if thou will thou can
[1:19:19] make me clean he said I will be thou
[1:19:20] clean and from then on he was clean so
[1:19:24] Jesus was Jesus was on his way to where
[1:19:27] that man was in the tombs we don't know
[1:19:29] how long he was in that condition but
[1:19:31] that doesn't matter
[1:19:33] amen he didn't start off one day he was
[1:19:36] saying a normal next day in the tombs
[1:19:38] something happened to him open a door
[1:19:40] one devil God and a beast he got worse
[1:19:42] and worse and worse and he found himself
[1:19:43] where he was but Jesus knew where he was
[1:19:47] the resurrection and the life was
[1:19:49] actually making his way towards where
[1:19:51] that man was and it's the same thing
[1:19:53] today you've got nah this is you're
[1:19:55] gonna recognize the same God that walked
[1:19:57] the shores of Galilee is exactly the
[1:20:00] same one here right the same Jesus it's
[1:20:04] not a different Jesus it's not Alyssa
[1:20:06] Jesus and as exactly he's the same in
[1:20:09] power he's the same in authority he's
[1:20:12] the same in deliverance he's the same in
[1:20:14] healing is the same in peace all that he
[1:20:16] is it's in the believer
[1:20:18] I remember programs had all that God
[1:20:21] poured into Christ yo-yo all that God
[1:20:24] was he brought himself into Christ
[1:20:26] and although he poured into Christ he
[1:20:28] poured into them you should say me
[1:20:33] hallelujah well the scripture says -
[1:20:35] were filled with the fullness of God
[1:20:37] hallelujah so exactly the same one is
[1:20:41] present in 2019 just not in his corporal
[1:20:45] body we're gonna meet that in the air
[1:20:46] hallelujah that's gonna be a glorious
[1:20:48] time amen see season first Corinthians 2
[1:20:53] and 12 how we have received not the
[1:20:55] spirit of the world but the Spirit which
[1:20:57] is of God that we might know the things
[1:20:59] which are freely given to us of God
[1:21:02] hallelujah which things also we speak
[1:21:05] not in the words which man's wisdom
[1:21:07] teacheth excuse me do we have but which
[1:21:13] is the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing
[1:21:16] spiritual things with spiritual but the
[1:21:19] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:21:21] the Spirit of God for they are
[1:21:23] foolishness unto him neither can he know
[1:21:25] them because they are spirit
[1:21:27] they discern but he that is spiritual
[1:21:29] judgeth all things yet himself as judged
[1:21:31] of no man for who has known the mind of
[1:21:34] the Lord that he may instruct him but we
[1:21:36] have the mind of Christ I mean so the
[1:21:39] mind of Christ is in the people today
[1:21:42] they men we have the mind of Christ
[1:21:44] we're not guessing we know because it's
[1:21:47] been revealed to us I mean we know the
[1:21:49] things that are freely given to us of
[1:21:51] God why cuz we don't have the spirit of
[1:21:54] the world where the Spirit of God
[1:21:55] hallelujah so now if we know the things
[1:21:58] freely given unto us and we will go and
[1:22:00] get them we will become not just
[1:22:02] professors but possessors so a professor
[1:22:06] just says it's - - mind a possessor says
[1:22:08] I have it
[1:22:09] hallelujah just like Abraham with Isaac
[1:22:12] he says I've got him where is he he's
[1:22:14] coming he's here 25 years later his
[1:22:17] revelation became material that's the
[1:22:20] same thing with us we don't just say we
[1:22:21] have it we have it Memphis is a
[1:22:24] substance of things not seen in evidence
[1:22:26] of things hoped for I mean so and that
[1:22:28] word hope means an expectation so it's
[1:22:31] the evidence of things not seen
[1:22:32] that's the yes it's the expectation of
[1:22:35] the young sorry let's go to Hebrews 11
[1:22:42] we'll get back to Legion bran he's on
[1:22:45] his way now faith is the substance of
[1:22:51] things hoped for so it's the substances
[1:22:55] the evidence of things expected for the
[1:22:58] evidence of things not seen
[1:23:00] so faith is not a hope so that you know
[1:23:04] you haven't Amen it's an evidence it's a
[1:23:07] proof that you have it and it's and it's
[1:23:11] things that would hope as an expectation
[1:23:13] usually with pleasure so you know it you
[1:23:16] know you're actually expecting it as we
[1:23:18] heard on Wednesday expectation faith
[1:23:20] gives us expectation hallelujah so now
[1:23:23] if the Spirit of the Lord reveals to us
[1:23:26] the things freely given to us of God
[1:23:27] what does it do it gives us an evidence
[1:23:30] that we have it the things that are
[1:23:32] expected hallelujah so you know if
[1:23:37] you're sitting légion in the tombs yeah
[1:23:39] got to have an expectation this is not
[1:23:40] my
[1:23:40] final destination the devil may have
[1:23:42] robbed me may have done all kinds of
[1:23:44] things to me I may be in the state but
[1:23:46] Jesus is on his way and Jesus is here
[1:23:49] now hallelujah season Philippians
[1:23:53] foreign voices rejoice in the Lord
[1:23:56] always and again I say rejoice let your
[1:23:59] moderation be known unto all men the the
[1:24:01] Lord is at hand it says be careful for
[1:24:04] nothing now that would careful it means
[1:24:08] to be anxious about so be anxious about
[1:24:11] nothing don't be stressed don't be
[1:24:14] worried don't be concerned and now that
[1:24:17] doesn't mean don't be no it doesn't say
[1:24:19] basically so don't be blase yeah it
[1:24:24] comes goes whatever sweet as she'll be
[1:24:26] right that's not what this is saying
[1:24:28] it's saying don't be anxious don't get
[1:24:30] stressed about it
[1:24:31] how's this going to happen I don't know
[1:24:33] God said God said in his word it's
[1:24:36] become revealed to me I know it's going
[1:24:39] to happen
[1:24:40] hallelujah so don't be anxious about
[1:24:42] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[1:24:44] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:24:47] requests be known unto God and the peace
[1:24:50] of God which passes all understanding
[1:24:52] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[1:24:54] Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever
[1:24:57] things are true whatsoever things are
[1:24:59] honest whatsoever things are just
[1:25:01] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:25:03] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:25:04] of a good report if there be any virtue
[1:25:07] if there be any praise think on these
[1:25:09] things those things which he have both
[1:25:12] learned and received and heard and seen
[1:25:14] in me do and the God of peace shall be
[1:25:18] with you hallelujah
[1:25:21] so he shouldn't be anxious about nothing
[1:25:23] just walk on with God whatever is going
[1:25:25] on just walk on with him but Legion came
[1:25:28] to his place in this life where
[1:25:29] something happened to him and it allowed
[1:25:31] a devil to come and he was a believer
[1:25:34] but then this happened to him and he
[1:25:37] found himself going in a downward cycle
[1:25:38] where he then he eventually found
[1:25:40] himself crying depressed alone cutting
[1:25:44] himself and that surrounded by death
[1:25:48] they meant you you see people do you not
[1:25:54] people some some people wear black
[1:25:56] because they like the color other people
[1:25:58] wear black because they're actually
[1:25:59] surrounded by Death amen that's how was
[1:26:03] it my day Goths emo skulls death black
[1:26:06] whatever yeah what it's actually a
[1:26:08] spirit they didn't stay you know often I
[1:26:11] you know you know you see people they
[1:26:14] never you know people on the street they
[1:26:16] never how they are now they never
[1:26:18] started that way there was some little
[1:26:21] girl some little dad's little bundle of
[1:26:24] joy someone's sweetheart some mother's
[1:26:27] little bundle of joy they never started
[1:26:30] how they finished or how they are right
[1:26:32] now something happened to them which
[1:26:35] caused them to end up that way even even
[1:26:38] people who seemed to be very successful
[1:26:40] but what they do if they basically get
[1:26:44] rid of their families they'll just get
[1:26:45] rid of whatever that stands in their
[1:26:47] ambition in the way of their ambition
[1:26:49] I don't believe they started that way
[1:26:50] but something came in so now I'm just
[1:26:54] trying to cover every aspect of society
[1:26:56] we can be here in George Street we say
[1:26:59] what happened to them or he can be the
[1:27:01] richest person in the world well what
[1:27:03] happened to them because all they want
[1:27:05] is greed and make a name for themselves
[1:27:06] and fame and you know something happened
[1:27:09] to both those people which was bad to
[1:27:12] the world one is great and one is not
[1:27:14] but it's bad things of it because why
[1:27:16] they get rid of their families they cut
[1:27:18] you know they cut bad deals they do all
[1:27:20] kinds of terrible things and it's all
[1:27:22] out of selfishness what happened they
[1:27:25] never say yeah you take little children
[1:27:27] they're all lovely amen and they they
[1:27:33] give me little two-by-fours but they're
[1:27:35] wonderful things you know but then you
[1:27:37] look at that and you just go a few years
[1:27:40] and you go well what happened from they
[1:27:42] were like this and then now they're like
[1:27:43] this we know it's because sure we are
[1:27:47] born in a fallen state but the devil
[1:27:50] comes in and just cripples people up and
[1:27:56] that's not what we meant to be
[1:27:59] Legion was not meant to be Legion bad
[1:28:03] things happened to us all those people
[1:28:06] out there the bride all the same things
[1:28:09] happened to us we can't stop it we can't
[1:28:12] stop bad things happening even if we
[1:28:15] even if we said ok friends I've just
[1:28:17] bought a hundred hectares in the back of
[1:28:19] a Katara we're all off the grid bad
[1:28:22] things will still happen you can't
[1:28:25] escape the world naturally people try
[1:28:27] and they prep and they do whatever you
[1:28:29] can't escape the bet because the Devils
[1:28:31] in here right but that's how you allow
[1:28:35] it to affect you how you respond can God
[1:28:39] identify himself in your response even
[1:28:43] to your enemy he said love your enemies
[1:28:46] do good to them that you know treat you
[1:28:49] badly can you do that and then God says
[1:28:52] I can i anoint that life as you treat
[1:28:55] them that way amen
[1:28:58] so he ended up brother and says one so
[1:29:02] one day way down and land of Gator I
[1:29:03] know no doubt a sociable god-fearing
[1:29:06] citizen once lived
[1:29:07] he got out with the wrong crowd maybe
[1:29:09] just married and had two or three little
[1:29:11] kitties but he got mixed up in the wrong
[1:29:14] group and that's where many a young man
[1:29:16] and young woman loses out getting mixed
[1:29:18] up in the wrong group the wrong
[1:29:20] associates and so one day they'd taken
[1:29:23] him out give him a drink I played a
[1:29:24] little game will do this gamble a little
[1:29:26] it won't hurt then the first devil
[1:29:28] entered him he went home and has to tell
[1:29:31] his wife a lie the second devil entered
[1:29:34] him and until he was possessed with a
[1:29:37] legion and he got beyond any help and
[1:29:40] the poor fellow was drove out into the
[1:29:42] tombs but then Jesus came I'm just gonna
[1:29:47] wrap this up but then Jesus came but
[1:29:50] then there was worship but it was the
[1:29:52] devil worshiping God it wasn't the man
[1:29:56] that was worshiping because Jesus asked
[1:29:59] him who are you
[1:30:00] we're legion for him any it wasn't the
[1:30:02] man speaking it was the devil in him
[1:30:05] worshiping but the life that was being
[1:30:08] lived behind that worship wasn't wasn't
[1:30:11] a God living life
[1:30:13] amen help us Lord Jesus and brother BAM
[1:30:16] says now it comes down like an like in
[1:30:18] Jesus day there were the disciples and
[1:30:21] they were the scribes and Pharisees they
[1:30:22] were pole opposite one had joy peace God
[1:30:26] living the other was dead formal
[1:30:28] powerless proud arrogant people but but
[1:30:31] but brother and says now adays it comes
[1:30:33] to this he calls it the thin edge of the
[1:30:34] wedge so it comes down to the very close
[1:30:39] where the people can say the same thing
[1:30:42] they can quote the same prophet they can
[1:30:44] say amen to the same quotes they can aim
[1:30:46] in the same scripture they can quote the
[1:30:48] same scripture but one has the life of
[1:30:53] the word and the other does not that's
[1:30:58] the thin edge of the which it's when God
[1:31:02] comes down identifies himself anew what
[1:31:05] is the purpose of what is the purpose of
[1:31:08] this that he would live in people that
[1:31:13] is that is what is Christianity God
[1:31:15] living in man
[1:31:17] that is the purpose why did he die that
[1:31:19] he would live in you data would go from
[1:31:22] quoting to living remember brother you
[1:31:25] know I think it's brother on Spencer
[1:31:27] said you know God's not going to wrap
[1:31:28] your Bibles your Bible will stay here
[1:31:31] your message books will stay here your
[1:31:33] tablets will stay here hallelujah
[1:31:36] I mean those things will stay here but
[1:31:38] God is going to rapture human beings
[1:31:40] that are full of his presence full of
[1:31:43] his word that is the only thing going in
[1:31:45] the rapture as when God can identify
[1:31:47] himself in the life and say that's part
[1:31:50] of me upon the earth I'm not leaving it
[1:31:52] on the earth no more they're coming to
[1:31:54] where I am hallelujah so it's the thin
[1:31:58] each of the which what life are you
[1:32:02] producing you can say all the right
[1:32:04] things you know we could have this
[1:32:07] church perfect some churches as a
[1:32:10] doctrine you've got to wear a certain
[1:32:11] time that is right so we could we could
[1:32:15] be outwardly perfect perfect but as God
[1:32:19] here
[1:32:20] as God here I would rather pick up and
[1:32:26] Magento's and jeans if that's all I had
[1:32:29] if that's the best I had and God live I
[1:32:31] know that's an extreme case but I've
[1:32:33] been and I've been in Papua New Guinea
[1:32:35] literally wearing just gendell's yo
[1:32:38] t-shirt and you know not a tie and this
[1:32:41] stuff God comes down speaks to those
[1:32:44] people those things that I don't they
[1:32:47] have even seen here hallelujah it's our
[1:32:50] attitude towards the word that matters
[1:32:52] I'm not discounting wearing this right I
[1:32:55] think it's good but you know but it's
[1:32:57] our attitude we can be all outwardly
[1:33:00] right with a stinking attitude trying to
[1:33:02] destroy one another speaking ill of one
[1:33:04] another tearing one another down you
[1:33:06] know unhappy discontented strife envy
[1:33:10] going through what is that but yet
[1:33:12] worship what is that that's legion thank
[1:33:16] you what else is it it's not God and
[1:33:19] kind of God and kind of God than kind of
[1:33:21] not God than the devil that's God or
[1:33:24] Satan two different ones but here it was
[1:33:33] he went out with it did were don't be an
[1:33:38] individual ated in your family don't
[1:33:42] because that leads to a slippery slope
[1:33:44] you'll end up like this and you'll be
[1:33:46] tormenting you know I tried to drink my
[1:33:49] own happiness away didn't work people
[1:33:52] try and do way worse of things but I
[1:33:53] tried to drown it you know it doesn't
[1:33:57] help that there's no lasting
[1:33:59] satisfaction been there done that got
[1:34:02] the scars wish I never had to but God
[1:34:05] allows it and God allows you to remember
[1:34:07] it because that will keep you thankful
[1:34:09] that you're delivered color that's why
[1:34:12] we clear that's why we don't rejoice and
[1:34:14] what we once did but we rejoice that
[1:34:17] we're free
[1:34:18] that's why God told the children of
[1:34:20] Israel tell your children your
[1:34:21] children's children what you came out of
[1:34:23] your slaves you're beaten you are just a
[1:34:26] tool in the Pharaohs hand tell them
[1:34:28] where you came from that's why we're
[1:34:30] going to always tell our children where
[1:34:32] we came from they may not understand it
[1:34:35] be say this is what I once was and this
[1:34:38] is why I want nothing to do with it
[1:34:39] because it bound me up it twisted me up
[1:34:42] and gave me trouble in my mind I had no
[1:34:44] peace I had to erase I had no joy
[1:34:46] nothing lost that nothing was satisfying
[1:34:48] I thought I found it that it just fell
[1:34:50] apart I thought I found it I fell apart
[1:34:52] I went here tried this win it tried this
[1:34:55] win it tried this
[1:34:56] nothing satisfied until one day the Lord
[1:34:58] Jesus came in my life transformed me and
[1:35:01] now I found peace now I found
[1:35:03] satisfaction now I found joy now I found
[1:35:06] love now found acceptance and I never
[1:35:09] never never never never never never
[1:35:11] never want to go back never ever
[1:35:14] you could honestly I would rather be
[1:35:18] homeless on the street with the
[1:35:20] revelation of Jesus Christ then the
[1:35:23] richest richest man in all the world
[1:35:25] hallelujah you say well wolf I had a
[1:35:29] billion dollars what could I do and what
[1:35:32] then everyone it doesn't matter how rich
[1:35:35] say I have great technology is there
[1:35:38] come to a point where the stops beating
[1:35:41] this stops and there's words pronounced
[1:35:44] over their body they did time of death
[1:35:47] and then what you got to think about it
[1:35:53] he said well why are you going this way
[1:35:57] we have life we have the greatest the
[1:36:02] greatest thing is eternal life
[1:36:05] lelou you you know if I tell this wrong
[1:36:09] I'm sorry but your brother Ferdie was
[1:36:11] telling me a testimony of his mum and so
[1:36:14] she was having an operation not that
[1:36:16] long ago and she actually had an
[1:36:17] out-of-body experience and she had no
[1:36:21] fear just had peace was so happy and
[1:36:23] then she was actually going up above you
[1:36:26] up into heaven and she looked down and
[1:36:28] she saw all the people
[1:36:31] people in Auckland or burdened down like
[1:36:33] this but then he's but then she saw
[1:36:36] where where the youth were doing
[1:36:38] outreach and they're singing and brother
[1:36:40] Zion singing about love will conquer the
[1:36:42] world or love is what the world needs
[1:36:44] are you singing about the Lord and all
[1:36:46] those people that heard heard that heard
[1:36:48] that singing and saw the believers they
[1:36:50] stood up straight the burdens kind of
[1:36:52] left them there happy and before this
[1:36:55] brother Ferdie said that he was
[1:36:57] wondering is the outreach doing anything
[1:36:59] they they didn't understand the
[1:37:01] supernatural part of it and then she was
[1:37:05] about and then she got taken up she's
[1:37:06] about to go through the gates into
[1:37:07] heaven but then a voice said to her your
[1:37:10] purpose on earth is not done and now
[1:37:13] she's back alive on the earth but she
[1:37:16] had and you can ask Christine about when
[1:37:18] she nearly departed this world no fear
[1:37:22] peace didn't really want to come back
[1:37:26] why is that cause the sudden question is
[1:37:29] sidled hallelujah so it doesn't matter
[1:37:32] what happens to this thing blessed
[1:37:35] assurance Jesus is mine i what a
[1:37:37] foretaste of glory divine oh yeah he
[1:37:45] says I'll just finish with this I don't
[1:37:47] want be too much longer but see this
[1:37:49] poor fellow he was drove out into the
[1:37:51] tombs the dead place and they bound him
[1:37:54] with chains and they could and he could
[1:37:56] pluck them asunder now when the devil
[1:37:57] possesses a person he becomes me times
[1:37:59] of strengthen if a devil can give you
[1:38:01] twice your strength what do you what do
[1:38:04] you think God could do for people
[1:38:05] sitting here in a wheelchair what do you
[1:38:07] think God could do to you that's a
[1:38:08] sinner if the devil can drive you into a
[1:38:11] barroom will get you into the street
[1:38:12] immorally or doing the things of the
[1:38:15] world which is contrary to your own
[1:38:17] nature because you were born to be a son
[1:38:19] and daughter of God now I just say this
[1:38:22] I used to the weekend for me started on
[1:38:25] a Wednesday ended on Monday we would go
[1:38:31] out into town this is this is in Christ
[1:38:33] Church it ones like basically the whole
[1:38:35] University was it the other night life
[1:38:37] was what they call pumping
[1:38:38] I remember going there once being sober
[1:38:41] and I was singing this is madness wasn't
[1:38:44] even a Christian
[1:38:45] and why because you ought to come under
[1:38:47] the influence of something to enjoy it
[1:38:49] and that's how many people yeah many
[1:38:52] things in the world you got actually
[1:38:53] become drunk or stoned or high or
[1:38:55] whatever to enjoy it you know and many
[1:38:58] people they needed they need a drink in
[1:39:00] their hand to actually become sociable
[1:39:03] why why do you need a substance to fit
[1:39:06] into somewhere you know God didn't God
[1:39:10] and make now you gotta have this to fit
[1:39:13] in in the world you following me you
[1:39:16] know but but that's how the world is you
[1:39:18] got to be drunk or stoned or high
[1:39:19] whatever you got to be on something
[1:39:20] uppers downers whatever's you know to to
[1:39:22] cope to fit in we don't want to be that
[1:39:26] way you know when you're in it you think
[1:39:29] it's awesome but when you can look
[1:39:30] soberly whether you think man that's
[1:39:31] crazy
[1:39:33] let's be sober-minded hallelujah now
[1:39:40] because see which is contrary to your
[1:39:42] own nature cause you were born to be a
[1:39:44] son and daughter of God and the devil
[1:39:46] could make you do things and cheat on
[1:39:47] your husband cheat on your wife steal
[1:39:49] cheat lie how much more can God do when
[1:39:51] he gets full possession of you and this
[1:39:53] fellow Legion wants a gentleman no hopes
[1:39:55] now he's out in the tombs with the devil
[1:39:57] and year after year he got worse and
[1:39:59] worse and he got so that no man could
[1:40:01] pass that way no he didn't want to hurt
[1:40:03] anyone
[1:40:04] he knew better than to do that but every
[1:40:06] time he's seen someone the devil would
[1:40:08] jump on him and he would go and try and
[1:40:10] kill that person till everyone feed him
[1:40:13] he was executed from all society from
[1:40:16] the from the city the devil had drove
[1:40:18] him out of his mind and he was out in
[1:40:20] the tomb the darkest hour he had ever
[1:40:22] seen and then Jesus came along and he
[1:40:26] cast the Devils out of him and those
[1:40:28] Devils went into a herd of hogs and they
[1:40:31] had sense enough to drown themselves I
[1:40:33] often wondered when I get to heaven I'd
[1:40:35] like to see how much strength his
[1:40:37] testimony had against hog raisers in
[1:40:39] that country after that you know I often
[1:40:42] think about it there were 2,000 hogs
[1:40:46] drowned that's a lot of pigs it's not
[1:40:49] just one or two that's a mass drowning
[1:40:51] there was a big thing but when the when
[1:40:55] when the hog raisers began to testify to
[1:40:58] this manner
[1:40:58] being delivered but the hogs were
[1:41:00] drowned it was in such a way that the
[1:41:02] people of the city didn't want Jesus
[1:41:04] around he sees and that they didn't want
[1:41:07] any revival think how sad this is they
[1:41:10] didn't want any revival if it was going
[1:41:12] to cost them some hogs they felt more at
[1:41:15] home with the hogs and the Devils than
[1:41:17] they did with the Lord Jesus
[1:41:18] they wanted their hogs and asked him to
[1:41:21] leave crazy and that's the way it is
[1:41:24] tonight people would rather stay in
[1:41:26] their old stale formal ungodly
[1:41:28] indifferent condition than to put up
[1:41:30] with a little wild fire now and then I'd
[1:41:33] rather have a thousand times to one they
[1:41:36] feel better at home with the Devils and
[1:41:38] in their old condition drinking smoking
[1:41:39] gambling wearing all dirty clothes and
[1:41:42] bobbing off their hair and doing all
[1:41:44] this other stuff that they do feel more
[1:41:46] at home doing that and they then you do
[1:41:49] to be called old-fashioned and have
[1:41:51] Jesus around the house
[1:41:52] I'll take him a hundred billion times to
[1:41:55] one the darkest hour then Jesus came
[1:41:58] along could you imagine Legion going
[1:42:00] back to his home
[1:42:01] finding where he used to live the little
[1:42:03] wife had to sell the place he wanted to
[1:42:05] wish yours at so he searched from place
[1:42:08] to place finally someone said she lives
[1:42:10] down the alley and when he goes down
[1:42:12] there and two old little tin shack then
[1:42:14] when the children see him coming they
[1:42:16] run to hide the wife grabbed up a little
[1:42:19] shawl put it on her and started out the
[1:42:21] gate he said never mind honey never mind
[1:42:23] children come here to Daddy I want you
[1:42:26] to take I want to take you in my arms I
[1:42:27] want to put my arms around you
[1:42:30] sweetheart
[1:42:31] your little dresses at or off oh she
[1:42:33] said what happened he said Jesus came
[1:42:36] along that's what made the difference
[1:42:38] our wife babies come here it was the
[1:42:41] darkest time the Devils were to
[1:42:43] tormenting me and then Jesus came along
[1:42:47] that's more than a story that's more
[1:42:50] than a that's more than a story that's
[1:42:52] more than someone else's testimony he's
[1:42:55] the same God today however he can do the
[1:42:58] same deliverance that man was out of his
[1:43:00] mind he couldn't pray he couldn't seek
[1:43:03] deliverance but some one of us he was
[1:43:05] praying for him amen and Jesus came
[1:43:08] along
[1:43:09] and that same Jesus can do the same
[1:43:11] deliverance Amy to those you say well
[1:43:13] there's no hope for them hold on hold on
[1:43:16] just let Jesus go along and you'll see
[1:43:19] they won't end up that way hallelujah
[1:43:23] just let Jesus come along you gotta just
[1:43:27] only belief hallelujah don't put don't
[1:43:30] put conditions it can't be done no it
[1:43:31] can be done if Jesus can can deliver
[1:43:34] that man if Jesus can deliver the
[1:43:37] Apostle Paul up to here in religion if
[1:43:39] Jesus can heal the woman deliver the
[1:43:42] woman of the world all these examples in
[1:43:44] when going all the way through the
[1:43:46] message people blaspheme people that all
[1:43:47] kinds of things but Jesus came along and
[1:43:50] delivered them gave them peace gave them
[1:43:52] salvation he's still the same God today
[1:43:55] hallelujah we say it's nothing's
[1:43:58] happened just wait just let Jesus come
[1:44:01] along oh yeah how Louie's mighty to save
[1:44:06] amen absolutely can we have the
[1:44:08] musicians please hallelujah say well I
[1:44:21] feel isolated my family doesn't
[1:44:23] understand me no one knows what I'm
[1:44:25] going through these people here could
[1:44:27] never put themselves in my shoes you'd
[1:44:29] be surprised you'd be shocked quite
[1:44:33] frankly if everyone stood up and gave
[1:44:37] their testimony didn't just just
[1:44:39] sugarcoat it a little bit and actually
[1:44:41] see how it really was you'd be shocked
[1:44:43] you mean you went through that you
[1:44:46] actually did that you actually enjoyed
[1:44:49] that in your fallen state I'll be honest
[1:44:53] hey you're born you're born and fallen
[1:44:56] state I enjoyed what I want what I once
[1:44:59] was in my fallen state but then Jesus
[1:45:01] came along and the things I once did I
[1:45:04] can't do not because I have to keep
[1:45:07] myself and all what will people think no
[1:45:09] that's not that's not it
[1:45:10] I mean changes your nature that what you
[1:45:13] once loved you hate and once you hated
[1:45:15] you and you now love and you can't help
[1:45:18] but it's like he just flicks a switch
[1:45:19] why because you give all your heart to
[1:45:22] him
[1:45:22] but if you come to them but you've
[1:45:24] actually got some fire exit to run
[1:45:26] through he'll never take you you'll be
[1:45:30] willing to say Lord every bridge has
[1:45:32] been burned there's no turning back Here
[1:45:35] I am
[1:45:36] and Jesus will come along hallelujah
[1:45:41] let's stand shall we let's just give him
[1:45:43] thanks aren't you this is Thanksgiving
[1:45:45] weekend I'm so glad I was once a Richard
[1:45:48] viola sooner but then Jesus came along
