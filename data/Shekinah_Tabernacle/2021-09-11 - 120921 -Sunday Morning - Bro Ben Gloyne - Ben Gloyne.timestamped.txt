[5:45] praise the lord
[5:46] good morning everybody welcome to church
[5:48] this morning it's good to
[5:49] have an opportunity to serve the lord
[5:51] again regardless of what our
[5:53] circumstances might be or our
[5:54] restrictions might be we are we've come
[5:56] here this morning to worship the lord
[5:58] and we're under great expectation
[6:01] that we're going to meet a supernatural
[6:02] god this morning to
[6:04] minister to us who's feeling good
[6:07] ready to praise the lord ready to
[6:09] put off all the
[6:11] the natural things that that so easily
[6:13] consume us and look at the supernatural
[6:15] this morning look at the
[6:17] the unseen god
[6:19] you know that that's that's everywhere
[6:22] and if we just surrender we can actually
[6:24] access this unseen god and actually his
[6:26] handiwork his handiwork is actually even
[6:29] though he's the unseen god his handiwork
[6:30] is all through the universe
[6:33] you know the
[6:34] creation all creation declares almighty
[6:37] god everywhere you look
[6:38] and that's what i love about
[6:40] the word of god
[6:42] is that i can relate it to things that i
[6:44] see the wisdom in the word of god i can
[6:46] relate it to to
[6:49] creation
[6:50] to how the ecosystem works how the
[6:52] animals work the different personalities
[6:54] it's all because it's the same the same
[6:58] the same god that wrote this made the
[7:00] universe so you know and when someone
[7:02] does the same thing it's kind of got
[7:03] their little um their
[7:05] their style on it you know so
[7:07] i like i love how i can look in creation
[7:09] and see the style of god see the
[7:10] thoughts of god portrayed in
[7:13] in creation and the way the animals work
[7:14] like god said about the ostrich you know
[7:17] i've made that ostrich void of wisdom it
[7:19] will just
[7:20] lay its eggs in the sand bury them over
[7:23] and just leave them here and doesn't it
[7:24] doesn't think maybe someone will stand
[7:25] on the eggs
[7:27] and my eggs the eggs will get ruined but
[7:29] an ostrich it doesn't really
[7:31] god said i've given made that ostrich
[7:33] void of wisdom so it will do something
[7:34] that's not good
[7:36] and
[7:37] we can relate it to us and think lord
[7:38] may you give me wisdom so i don't do
[7:40] things that are not good like we we can
[7:42] we can
[7:43] learn all these lessons so let's um
[7:44] stand this morning and we'll just um
[7:46] open the service and just commit this
[7:48] time to the lord heavenly father we're
[7:50] so grateful lord that we can enter into
[7:53] your house this morning
[7:55] lord and we're
[7:57] under great expectation to meet with you
[7:59] this morning lord we need you every hour
[8:02] lord you're the one that changes our
[8:03] life you're the one that makes our life
[8:04] worthwhile
[8:06] lord you're the one that
[8:08] that satisfies our hearts lord jesus
[8:10] lord there's no satisfaction outside of
[8:12] you
[8:13] regardless of whatever thing we may do
[8:15] or accomplish or anything like that lord
[8:17] there's no satisfaction
[8:19] outside of being in your presence lord
[8:21] and
[8:22] being under the shadow of your winged
[8:24] lord jesus so we just wanted to invite
[8:25] you into our midst this morning may
[8:27] bless us lord may visit us in a powerful
[8:29] way
[8:30] lord jesus
[8:31] lord may we
[8:33] may our hearts be changed lord and may
[8:35] we be like those that walked along the
[8:36] road to emmaus daughters they said did
[8:38] not our hearts burned within us as he
[8:40] spoke with us along the way
[8:41] may bless the ministry that comes forth
[8:43] this morning may each heart be
[8:45] be receptive lord and we believe that we
[8:48] serve a supernatural god and we believe
[8:49] that we serve
[8:51] we're a fellowship that that surrenders
[8:54] to your spirit lord so we're under great
[8:55] expectation lord that the words that we
[8:57] hear this morning won't be from a man's
[8:59] lips lord but it'll be from the very
[9:00] heart of god lord say we come under that

[49:46] move on every situation for your glory
[49:48] we thank you dear god just pray lord as
[49:50] we've read a few scriptures from your
[49:51] word
[49:53] lord we know it's not necessarily the
[49:54] length of the scripture reading but lord
[49:56] it's what's contained in your word and
[49:57] we know it's you in print form so we ask
[50:00] you once again lord can you come and
[50:02] make your word live in our hearts once
[50:03] again may you anoint it for your glory
[50:05] to speak and to hearer in jesus christ's
[50:07] name may you grant it amen amen god
[50:10] bless you friends you may have your
[50:11] seats this morning
[50:13] um i'd like to
[50:16] speak on this here if you want to can
[50:19] you put up yet down a little bit can you
[50:21] put those three scriptures up on the
[50:23] projector
[50:24] can we do that um
[50:27] now the apostle paul was a very uh
[50:30] unique individual
[50:31] in a way
[50:32] uh compared to the world he was an
[50:34] oddball he was a strange character
[50:37] uh from what he was to what he became in
[50:39] the lord jesus christ but i was
[50:41] listening to the audio book of the book
[50:43] of galatians yesterday and this and
[50:45] these scriptures really jumped out to me
[50:47] where the apostle paul because you know
[50:50] in the galatians we know he is dealing
[50:51] with legalism has come in amongst the
[50:53] believers they the the light of a former
[50:56] age of being under the law has come in
[50:57] among the believers and now the
[50:59] believer's being swayed back into trying
[51:01] to keep the law and you know any and he
[51:03] asks you know the question in in the
[51:05] book of galatians he says you know
[51:07] does does he that you know does miracles
[51:10] among you does he do it by keeping the
[51:11] law or is it preaching the word and you
[51:13] know or you know the spirit working
[51:14] among you is it by keeping the law or is
[51:16] it by the by the law of faith
[51:19] and he shows them really that
[51:20] circumcision around circumcision it
[51:22] doesn't avail anything
[51:25] but them but but but it's being a new
[51:27] creature it's verse 15 it's it's being a
[51:29] new creature and as many as walk
[51:31] according to this rule
[51:34] peace be on them and mercy and upon the
[51:36] israel of god so
[51:38] so he he he's coming down to this
[51:40] conclusion he's wanting the people to
[51:42] see
[51:43] it's not that you keep certain a
[51:45] circumcision of traditions of you know
[51:47] how things used to be or even
[51:48] uncircumcision so it's not being liberal
[51:51] or legal if i can put it that way it's
[51:53] actually it's it's what avails as being
[51:55] a new creature in christ that's really
[51:57] the power i mean that's released is
[51:59] through the new birth it says as many
[52:01] walk according to this rule then peace
[52:04] be on them and mercy and upon the israel
[52:06] of god now the apostle paul if you know
[52:08] if we could step back into his time he
[52:10] lived in a very politically charged
[52:12] environment you know
[52:14] when you when you look into the into
[52:16] when titus came and he beseeched
[52:18] jerusalem and he massacred most of the
[52:19] city and he destroyed the city and you
[52:21] know not one stone was you know the
[52:23] temple was laid upon another and you
[52:25] know they carried away the jewish people
[52:27] into slavery and they took all the
[52:29] treasures of the city away you know that
[52:31] didn't just happen overnight but there
[52:32] was a simmering of
[52:34] a of an uprising
[52:36] that was there and there was political
[52:38] there were factions being developed and
[52:40] you know there was you know there were
[52:42] pools of you know are you forestry
[52:43] against us are you on this side here on
[52:45] that side you know and you can't be in
[52:47] the middle either you're for us or
[52:49] against us are you for the romans you're
[52:50] against the romans are you for a jewish
[52:52] liberty or are you against the jewish
[52:54] liberty are you for the jews having
[52:56] their own nation are you against it you
[52:57] can't be you can't be in the middle this
[52:59] is how polarizing the world was just
[53:02] before destruction was going to hit it
[53:03] was very polarizing and i feel where we
[53:06] have come back to this place but not
[53:08] just the city but the whole world not
[53:10] just a city not just a nation but the
[53:12] whole world because tribulation's coming
[53:14] we understand that but the apostle paul
[53:17] walked in such a way where those things
[53:20] didn't pull him left or right those
[53:22] things didn't sway him he wasn't on
[53:23] anyone's side he was on the lord's side
[53:26] and even even the thing is because there
[53:28] was a blindness coming upon people you
[53:30] know you know upon the jews different
[53:32] things were going on there that people
[53:34] were being pulled back into into into
[53:37] the traditions of the fathers instead of
[53:39] walking in the light of the gospel and
[53:41] it's the same thing today where people
[53:43] can look back and say this is what the
[53:44] reformers did this is what other ages
[53:46] did and they try and pattern themselves
[53:48] after a former thing but we're not
[53:50] called to patent ourselves after a
[53:51] former age we're called to patent
[53:53] ourselves after the word of god for this
[53:55] age which is the full word of god but
[53:57] see
[53:58] see the galatians that spirit that
[54:00] lukewarm spirit came into the galatian
[54:02] church to make them be something they
[54:04] weren't called to be they weren't called
[54:06] to be under the law
[54:07] right they were called to walk in the
[54:09] power of the resurrection
[54:11] and so he's saying here that it's that
[54:13] it's that if it's actually being a new
[54:16] creature that what avails now i'm going
[54:18] to break this down but you know the
[54:19] apostle paul knew he was upon the earth
[54:21] for a purpose
[54:22] right he knew he wasn't there for a
[54:24] haphazard reason or just because he felt
[54:26] like changing churches it wasn't that
[54:28] kind of thing no he met the lord on the
[54:30] road to damascus it transformed his life
[54:32] he was a man who was a pharisee of the
[54:34] pharisees very devote man we know this
[54:37] right but then god met him in such a
[54:38] supernatural way that his whole life
[54:41] became new and he counted everything he
[54:43] once did but dung that he would win
[54:45] christ right so everything else in his
[54:48] life he put it in one category dung
[54:51] amen and that's how we've got to be all
[54:53] of our life we've got to when it
[54:54] compares to the lord it's got to be done
[54:57] our career our our whatever we think we
[55:00] are our former religious ways it's got
[55:02] to be done
[55:04] and so the apostle paul was trying to
[55:06] get the galatians to see no it is the
[55:08] power of the new birth
[55:11] and as many as walk in this rule
[55:14] peace be on them i'm going to repeat
[55:15] this a bit because what rule are we
[55:17] walking after
[55:18] is it the rule of our own minds or our
[55:20] own ideas was actually walking and
[55:22] really you know brother brown makes a
[55:24] statement he says if the church only
[55:25] realized her position
[55:27] she will one day then the rapture will
[55:29] go
[55:29] and i believe the rapture will be in you
[55:32] know
[55:33] it could be in times like this
[55:35] why not
[55:36] oh no we're going to go back to how it
[55:38] was who says the world's going to go
[55:40] back to how it was
[55:41] right we shouldn't be looking for a
[55:43] living in some dream of the future no
[55:45] what about right now
[55:46] right now is the best time
[55:48] right now is the best time to be alive
[55:50] right now i heard brother brahm said
[55:52] that a father could have put him on the
[55:54] you know you know you know you know
[55:56] before time could have could have
[55:57] actually asked him when do you want to
[55:58] preach the gospel do you want to preach
[56:00] it you know you could pick any age you
[56:02] wanted he said i would have picked right
[56:04] now
[56:05] hallelujah and and to me that's how i
[56:07] feel it would have been amazing to be
[56:09] there at jesus's feet when he was there
[56:10] at his first coming it would have been
[56:12] amazing even you know to be there with
[56:14] the apostle paul or you know through one
[56:15] of the great moves of reformation it
[56:17] would have been amazing then but right
[56:19] now
[56:20] even it's better to be alive now than in
[56:22] 1965 when the prophet was here this is a
[56:24] better day
[56:26] hallelujah
[56:28] amen now brother bam says and i know and
[56:31] and and i've um
[56:33] shared this before but it's in those
[56:35] crucial hours that press us on those
[56:37] sacred sands
[56:38] it was in the bible remember no matter
[56:40] how great the distress is
[56:42] satan cannot take your life until god is
[56:44] finished with you
[56:46] there is nothing can happen to you
[56:47] unless god permits it
[56:49] there is nothing that can happen to you
[56:51] unless god permits it who believes that
[56:54] everything god is in charge satan's not
[56:56] in charge god has the final say god has
[56:59] to satan has to actually ask permission
[57:01] from god if he can do anything to you
[57:04] amen
[57:05] amen so there's nothing can happen to
[57:07] you unless god permits it there's no
[57:08] evil can come unless god permits it and
[57:11] it's for your good he is working that
[57:13] now let's think when the floods came to
[57:16] destroy the world it could not destroy
[57:17] noah no it could not be destroyed
[57:19] because that god had a work for him to
[57:21] do
[57:22] one day down in a great nation under a
[57:24] great bondage there are some hebrew
[57:26] children
[57:27] that we know as shadrach meshach and
[57:28] abednego and it came to a place where
[57:30] they had to make a decision that
[57:33] something had to be done their faith was
[57:34] put to a test and when your faith is put
[57:36] to a test then don't fail
[57:39] stay right with what you believe we have
[57:41] a choice right we have a choice we're
[57:42] going to stay with what we believe are
[57:44] we just going to
[57:45] you know are we going to just just
[57:46] compromise a little bit right when your
[57:48] faith is put to a test then don't fail
[57:50] state
[57:51] stay with what you believe and when your
[57:53] faith is put to a test and they went to
[57:56] a crucial hour
[57:57] not only did they go to an ash heap but
[57:59] they went into a fiery furnace but satan
[58:02] could not destroy them for god's purpose
[58:04] wasn't yet fulfilled they could go in
[58:06] there with this hope i know my redeemer
[58:08] liveth they could go in there with this
[58:10] hope here we are assured that god is
[58:12] able to deliver us from this fiery
[58:14] furnace but nevertheless we will not bow
[58:17] to the image satan could not take them
[58:20] he could not drown noah in the flood
[58:22] until the purpose of god had been
[58:23] finished he could not burn up the hebrew
[58:26] children till the purpose of god had
[58:27] been finished he could not kill job with
[58:29] boils and trouble so the purpose of god
[58:31] had been finished neither could the
[58:32] lions eat daniel to the god's purpose
[58:34] had been finished neither could death
[58:36] and old age take abraham until the
[58:38] purpose of god had been finished and
[58:39] neither can it take you or take me until
[58:42] the purpose of god of our life is
[58:44] finished so we gather from their
[58:46] consolation and why does let god why
[58:49] does god let trouble come god harnesses
[58:51] trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes
[58:53] it obey him and those troubles bring us
[58:56] into a closer fellowship with god
[59:00] the apostle paul understood this
[59:03] he he could recount
[59:05] he's been shipwrecked he's been beaten
[59:08] 40 times yeah i mean i mean 40 stripes
[59:10] three times and you know he's been
[59:12] stoned you know he went through great
[59:14] persecutions he was chased he would have
[59:17] a meeting in one city and people
[59:18] actually resented his preaching and when
[59:20] he went to the other city those people
[59:21] would follow him and they would stir up
[59:23] the people against him and you know he
[59:25] would end up in jail in many places this
[59:27] was this was the life he kind of lived
[59:28] but these things didn't sway him
[59:32] hallelujah when he stood there in acts
[59:35] 26 and and and he was testifying to king
[59:38] agrippa of the account of the road to
[59:40] damascus and how he met the lord
[59:42] um he would he would say after he um
[59:46] after he gave that account he says we're
[59:48] upon king agrippa i was not disobedient
[59:51] to the heavenly vision
[59:53] that was tested he didn't have a flowery
[59:55] bed of ease i mean he was tested in that
[59:58] but he says i was not disobedient king
[59:59] agrippa he could have he could have put
[1:00:01] into that testimony i've been
[1:00:03] shipwrecked i've been beaten false
[1:00:05] brethren have come in without great
[1:00:06] distress and troubles and things going
[1:00:08] on but i have not been no disobedient to
[1:00:10] this heavenly vision and it should be
[1:00:12] the same thing with you and i you know
[1:00:14] this message coming as a heavenly vision
[1:00:16] to you and i where the word came open
[1:00:18] and gave you purpose in life to show you
[1:00:19] actually you're not from this terra
[1:00:21] firma you're from heaven amen that
[1:00:23] you're a son or daughter of god
[1:00:25] hallelujah
[1:00:27] amen now when the apostle paul would say
[1:00:30] there
[1:00:30] that the world
[1:00:32] is crucified unto me and i unto the
[1:00:35] world
[1:00:37] he was saying that world
[1:00:39] sorry that word world it speaks of the
[1:00:42] world order or the cosmos
[1:00:45] so this is what he is saying is dead to
[1:00:47] him
[1:00:48] the world affairs
[1:00:50] and the aggregate of earthly things so
[1:00:52] every earthly thing is dead to him this
[1:00:54] is what he's saying he just says it in
[1:00:56] in a few words
[1:00:57] but he's actually now this is his
[1:00:59] testimony being spoken he this is not
[1:01:01] just a nice idea or some instagram post
[1:01:04] or you know something on social media
[1:01:05] this is a living reality
[1:01:07] actually the world has been crucified to
[1:01:09] me i have no longing or desire to
[1:01:13] further myself in this world
[1:01:15] i was once a pharisee and i and and and
[1:01:18] i had a burden i'm going to climb the
[1:01:19] ivory tower being a pharisee i'm going
[1:01:21] to be the next best greatest pharisee
[1:01:23] that you know there's ever been he had
[1:01:25] political ambition in that too
[1:01:27] right but
[1:01:28] when the lord met him that died
[1:01:31] that died
[1:01:33] amen the only burden he had was the
[1:01:35] salvation of his people
[1:01:37] amen and getting the gospel to the
[1:01:38] gentiles he writes a lot about that he
[1:01:41] says i wish i was a castaway that is
[1:01:43] israel would be saved
[1:01:45] right but he says he says for the
[1:01:46] gentile sake they're blinded that the
[1:01:48] gentiles can come in but his burden was
[1:01:50] i want to see my nation saved
[1:01:53] so that was that was the thing that that
[1:01:55] burdened him
[1:01:56] amen why because he was he was living by
[1:01:59] this heavenly vision
[1:02:00] this was the thing that consumed him
[1:02:03] are you with me
[1:02:04] i mean this is the thing that you could
[1:02:06] say bothered him
[1:02:07] he wanted to see so the the salvation of
[1:02:10] his people he wanted to see people meet
[1:02:12] the lord so the world affairs
[1:02:14] the aggregate of earthly things now this
[1:02:16] is from the thales uh bible
[1:02:18] dictionary it says the whole circle of
[1:02:22] earthly goods
[1:02:23] endowments riches advantages pleasures
[1:02:26] etc that although hollow and frail and
[1:02:29] fleeting
[1:02:30] they stir desire
[1:02:32] and they seduce from god and our
[1:02:34] obstacles to the cause of christ
[1:02:37] this is the world cosmos so it stirs a
[1:02:40] desire there's a lot of things on the
[1:02:41] earth right now that are trending that
[1:02:43] are stirring desires i'm not just saying
[1:02:45] a desire for a new new car new house
[1:02:47] holiday no there's a desire of well i'm
[1:02:50] against this and i'm for this
[1:02:52] right vaccine no vaccine locked down no
[1:02:55] lockdown
[1:02:56] this this you know all the political
[1:02:58] movements on the earth that those stir
[1:03:00] debate they stir desire
[1:03:02] and you can't for some reason you can't
[1:03:04] be in the middle and just be actually no
[1:03:06] that's not our main problem here our
[1:03:08] main problem is if i can say the word
[1:03:10] problem is there's a tribulation coming
[1:03:12] and everyone better get in the ark don't
[1:03:14] just hang around it and look at it and
[1:03:16] sympathize get into jesus christ really
[1:03:18] surrender your life to him amen give
[1:03:21] your all to him amen this may be the
[1:03:23] last time we stand in this building i
[1:03:25] was thinking about this and probably you
[1:03:26] say well you're just getting emotional
[1:03:28] stirred up no no maybe if this is the
[1:03:30] last service we're ever in i don't want
[1:03:32] to stand at the judgment bar and say i
[1:03:34] didn't warn those people whoever's on
[1:03:36] the internet you better meet jesus
[1:03:37] christ you really better be sure don't
[1:03:39] just numb your conscience and say i'm a
[1:03:41] good person forget the good persons
[1:03:43] there'll be a lot of good people to be
[1:03:44] disappointed that day we want to be in
[1:03:46] jesus christ
[1:03:48] it doesn't matter how old or young we
[1:03:50] are you've got to give up and let him
[1:03:52] take over
[1:03:53] amen because that's what avails a new
[1:03:55] birth
[1:03:56] that's what has power
[1:03:58] amen
[1:04:00] but let's just go back to this i'm not
[1:04:01] done and are obstacles to the cause of
[1:04:03] christ
[1:04:05] anything that is your rallying cry above
[1:04:07] the lord is an obstacle to the cause of
[1:04:10] christ because what's the main thing
[1:04:12] at the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:04:14] speaks or what's in the heart whatever's
[1:04:16] in there's gonna come out
[1:04:18] i mean so so you know and your heart's
[1:04:20] only you know like brother paul had the
[1:04:21] containers showing the lord washing and
[1:04:24] cleansing us those containers had a
[1:04:26] certain volume
[1:04:27] right and you could pour oil or you can
[1:04:29] pour in all different kind of chemicals
[1:04:31] in there but there's a certain volume
[1:04:32] that it can possess it's the same thing
[1:04:34] with our hearts it has a limited
[1:04:36] capacity but what's it filled with
[1:04:39] is it filled with nonsense you know
[1:04:40] brother brown said that people will go
[1:04:42] insane in the end time and there's a lot
[1:04:44] of videos on social media people are
[1:04:46] insane they put filters on their faces
[1:04:49] and videos to make them look crazy and
[1:04:50] demon possessed they do crazy stuff what
[1:04:52] is it that's insanity coming on the
[1:04:54] streets and it's actually made to look
[1:04:56] normal
[1:04:58] but the problem is there's too many
[1:04:59] crazies for the same people to lock them
[1:05:01] up and give them treatment
[1:05:04] it's true
[1:05:05] you say well that's a bit much no that's
[1:05:07] true
[1:05:08] it's become normal why because our
[1:05:10] senses have been dulled down
[1:05:13] you know it wasn't that long ago upon
[1:05:15] this earth that you know women who
[1:05:17] walked along half naked in the street
[1:05:19] they are locked up
[1:05:21] or drunks were picked up and put in
[1:05:23] prison cells to sober up
[1:05:25] imagine trying to do that in wellington
[1:05:27] on a on a saturday night
[1:05:30] you'd need a way bigger prison than we
[1:05:32] have
[1:05:34] you would need a lot more police
[1:05:36] but now it's just well
[1:05:38] it's okay
[1:05:39] no i feel sorry for people trapped in
[1:05:41] that kind of bondage i was in that
[1:05:42] bondage it's a horrible task master you
[1:05:45] wake up and say you'll never do it again
[1:05:47] you find yourself doing it again and you
[1:05:49] can't break it but god comes down and
[1:05:51] breaks it takes a desire out of your
[1:05:53] life and you walk free
[1:05:55] amen that's what happened to me i saw a
[1:05:57] man it was such a good feeling when i
[1:05:58] realized i have no desire anymore where
[1:06:00] did that go god took it
[1:06:02] hallelujah
[1:06:04] amen praise our god
[1:06:07] amen so anything that that that is
[1:06:09] actually first
[1:06:11] anything contrary to the word of god
[1:06:13] he said but what about my family what's
[1:06:15] the burden you have for your family
[1:06:18] right should be the salvation that they
[1:06:20] would prosper spiritually
[1:06:22] seek ye first the kingdom of god and his
[1:06:24] righteousness and everything else will
[1:06:25] be added
[1:06:26] right you know who cares about
[1:06:29] all the money in the world you know i
[1:06:31] would not want to trade my life with the
[1:06:34] guy who owns amazon
[1:06:36] or bill gates or any of those people who
[1:06:37] got silly money they don't know what to
[1:06:39] do i wouldn't want to trade my life with
[1:06:41] them for the world
[1:06:43] not for a day
[1:06:44] i would rather keep this
[1:06:47] hallelujah i'd rather keep this because
[1:06:49] everyone's got an expiry date
[1:06:52] some have come at shorter some comment
[1:06:54] later but then even after all that
[1:06:55] everyone's going to stand before god and
[1:06:57] give an account what did you do with me
[1:06:59] when i came across your path
[1:07:01] did you give yourself
[1:07:03] or did you turn me down
[1:07:05] and of course the answer's already
[1:07:06] flashing there you know god doesn't have
[1:07:08] to come to a conclusion he knows what
[1:07:09] the conclusion is
[1:07:12] i'm glad we can stand in this day
[1:07:14] sensible minds and say lord i give you
[1:07:16] my all i give you my life
[1:07:19] hallelujah
[1:07:21] amen so that word avail he says it
[1:07:24] doesn't avail
[1:07:25] well i can't yeah i was joking i can't
[1:07:28] see that very good
[1:07:30] yeah the screen's shrunk someone put one
[1:07:33] yeah now see he says this see for in
[1:07:36] christ jesus neither circumcision
[1:07:38] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[1:07:40] a new creature so he says it doesn't
[1:07:43] avail anything he doesn't even say it
[1:07:45] doesn't avail much it doesn't avail
[1:07:46] anything so basically it's just empty
[1:07:49] there's no value to it there's no
[1:07:50] substance there's nothing that's
[1:07:51] actually going to do anything even this
[1:07:53] would uh avail available it means it
[1:07:56] means to have power
[1:07:57] to exert to yield power to have strength
[1:08:00] to overcome
[1:08:01] so to be i could say to be liberal to be
[1:08:04] legal if i can put in those kind of
[1:08:05] terms it doesn't avail anything there's
[1:08:08] no power to overcome there's no strength
[1:08:09] in it i mean to overcome the devil i
[1:08:12] mean there's no power i mean there's no
[1:08:15] power shown by extraordinary deeds
[1:08:17] there's no force
[1:08:19] amen there's no you know there's no
[1:08:21] strength in it so it's just empty right
[1:08:24] but a new birth
[1:08:25] is the thing that gives the strength i
[1:08:27] mean because we receive a new nature we
[1:08:30] receive a different we're a different
[1:08:31] kind of people we're not patched up i
[1:08:34] probably say this
[1:08:35] but i just we're going to repeat it
[1:08:36] we're not patched up you know it's not
[1:08:38] patches you know my dad used to work yo
[1:08:41] there in papua new guinea and and he
[1:08:43] used to manage a a coconut oil mill
[1:08:46] and over there you know it's not like
[1:08:48] here where you need a part you just go
[1:08:49] by the part and it turns up and you know
[1:08:51] you just go buy it they have to
[1:08:52] fabricate a lot of things and because
[1:08:54] the volcano is there and it's ashing and
[1:08:57] and it's and it's acidic when when when
[1:08:59] water goes on the ash then it eats away
[1:09:02] all the steel
[1:09:03] so a lot of that factory you can see it
[1:09:04] was literally patches on patches on
[1:09:06] patches trying to hold the thing up
[1:09:09] we're not like that
[1:09:11] we're not patches on patches on patches
[1:09:13] because the acidity of the devil no no
[1:09:15] we're new creations
[1:09:17] i mean that actually there's actually
[1:09:19] something built we become material that
[1:09:20] actually is not
[1:09:22] burnt up by the devil
[1:09:25] amen so we're not a patched up creation
[1:09:27] this is not a reformation this is a
[1:09:29] transformation i mean when the prophet
[1:09:31] preached god's power to transform he
[1:09:33] wasn't just saying a nice sermon title
[1:09:35] he was giving a declaration
[1:09:37] the spoken word has the power to
[1:09:39] transform the seed and then transform
[1:09:42] god's children i mean into what they
[1:09:44] should be into what's already within
[1:09:46] them to come forth hallelujah
[1:09:49] amen so circumcision or uncircumcision
[1:09:52] it doesn't avail anything but a new
[1:09:54] creature
[1:09:55] a new creation
[1:09:57] hallelujah
[1:09:59] hallelujah brother i'm says in the
[1:10:01] barman gilead you've got to be born
[1:10:03] again from above then you are new
[1:10:05] creatures in christ jesus and you're as
[1:10:07] abraham was you're his children you're
[1:10:09] seeking a city whose builder and maker
[1:10:12] is god
[1:10:13] that's why you act different that's why
[1:10:15] you see things different we see things
[1:10:17] different
[1:10:18] than the world do we not we see things
[1:10:21] very differently i mean we see in the
[1:10:23] scripture
[1:10:24] we're in the process of a rapture cycle
[1:10:27] the lord himself is descended with a
[1:10:28] shout the shout is the message a
[1:10:30] vindicated prophet told us i mean so
[1:10:32] we're in the process of the rapture
[1:10:33] cycle i mean so we see
[1:10:35] that we look at the world differently
[1:10:38] people maybe walk around heavy-hearted
[1:10:40] we don't have to be heavy-hearted we can
[1:10:42] be rejoicing even in a lockdown even
[1:10:44] when this world is gripped in the way it
[1:10:47] is we can rejoice and say glory
[1:10:49] amen the resurrection the life has come
[1:10:51] into me amen i become one with him amen
[1:10:55] i can't die no more than a god can die
[1:10:57] even if this body expires i'm still
[1:10:59] alive hallelujah and he's going to come
[1:11:01] and change this quick in this mortal
[1:11:03] body i mean the yeah you know the
[1:11:05] prophet emphasized a lot in the end of
[1:11:07] his ministry quickening power
[1:11:09] amen he said it you just searched that
[1:11:11] phrase in the message it's a lot in the
[1:11:13] end of his message the quickening power
[1:11:15] and he would preach about the true
[1:11:17] easter seal and you know he said that
[1:11:18] quickening power if the spirit that
[1:11:20] raised up jesus from the grave dwell in
[1:11:22] you he shall quicken your mortal bodies
[1:11:25] amen and that's why we are different
[1:11:27] kind of people will be made alive
[1:11:29] that's why we act different that's why
[1:11:31] we think different i mean because we
[1:11:32] have a way of escape i mean we don't we
[1:11:35] are not hopeless we are not helpless
[1:11:37] amen but god is here fighting our
[1:11:39] battles orchestrating all things
[1:11:41] preparing his people to leave this earth
[1:11:44] hallelujah
[1:11:46] amen that's why
[1:11:47] that's why you act different that's why
[1:11:49] you see things different you never get
[1:11:51] customized to this world
[1:11:55] we don't get adjusted
[1:11:57] and the more it becomes wicked the more
[1:11:59] shocked we should be
[1:12:00] we shouldn't just become used to it yeah
[1:12:02] there's a lot of new normals
[1:12:04] you can go decades you go back 100 years
[1:12:06] ago over 100 years now and you take
[1:12:08] fashion trends take social trends every
[1:12:11] decade there's a new normal
[1:12:14] you know we shouldn't be a customized to
[1:12:16] those things you know the world has
[1:12:18] already fallen apart
[1:12:20] you know it's already falling apart when
[1:12:21] the prophet preached the the the falling
[1:12:23] apart again of the world it wasn't kind
[1:12:26] of in an order but now it's fallen apart
[1:12:28] and all of us are actually born into a
[1:12:30] broken world and we think it's normal
[1:12:32] if we were 200 years old we could
[1:12:34] actually say no this is not normal
[1:12:36] society's broken everything's broken
[1:12:39] health care is broken the police system
[1:12:41] justice system is broken government's
[1:12:43] broken education's broken the whole
[1:12:45] world family's broken this world has
[1:12:48] fallen apart but we're alive in this
[1:12:50] world where it's falling apart you say
[1:12:51] well we've got a rally and we're going
[1:12:53] to rebuild the world brother braham said
[1:12:54] you can have an abraham lincoln or
[1:12:56] george washington and every county and
[1:12:58] every state in america wouldn't fix it
[1:13:03] amen so so if a vindicated prophet said
[1:13:05] that i'm not going to try because
[1:13:07] actually i've only got i'm very limited
[1:13:09] in my ability i can't multitask i want
[1:13:12] to be like the apostle paul
[1:13:14] i want to find all the all of the lord's
[1:13:16] children they get sealed into the
[1:13:18] kingdom then we can go home
[1:13:21] that's really you know
[1:13:23] hallelujah
[1:13:25] hallelujah
[1:13:27] amen
[1:13:29] you never get customized to this world
[1:13:31] because you're from above
[1:13:33] you act like the kingdom you belong in
[1:13:37] so i could say even right now
[1:13:39] how we act
[1:13:40] is reflecting a place we belong to
[1:13:44] right
[1:13:44] if we act like the world think like the
[1:13:46] world dressed like the world do like the
[1:13:48] world even in a religious way we're
[1:13:50] actually saying we're from this kingdom
[1:13:52] but i got good news ladies and gentlemen
[1:13:54] we don't have to stay belonging to this
[1:13:55] kingdom i mean there's a power of the
[1:13:57] blood of jesus christ that can transform
[1:13:59] a life i mean actually we don't reflect
[1:14:02] him um the earth or hell but we reflect
[1:14:04] heaven having to show actually we belong
[1:14:06] up in glory and even we actually all do
[1:14:09] belong up in glory
[1:14:11] god is not willing that any should
[1:14:12] perish but all should come to repentance
[1:14:16] amen now
[1:14:19] as we have there
[1:14:21] as many as walk after this rule
[1:14:25] peace be on them and mercy and upon the
[1:14:27] israel of god so what is that rule that
[1:14:29] is many walk in
[1:14:31] the power of the new creation
[1:14:34] of a people being born again after that
[1:14:36] rule
[1:14:38] now a rule
[1:14:41] uh it says here the definition i just
[1:14:43] had a good time in this
[1:14:46] because the apostle paul you know people
[1:14:48] you know you know the phrase i'm born
[1:14:49] again it's so diluted down
[1:14:52] that everyone's born again
[1:14:55] but it takes god to come and actually
[1:14:57] change in nature
[1:14:58] the things we once did we don't do no
[1:15:01] more not because we're told thou shall
[1:15:03] not he changes our desires he just
[1:15:05] reprograms us hallelujah and there's
[1:15:08] just nothing in you that wants it
[1:15:09] anymore
[1:15:10] amen so to be really born again amen he
[1:15:13] actually gives us a new nature and it's
[1:15:15] not something we just kind of walk into
[1:15:17] he just does it
[1:15:19] amen
[1:15:20] i believe in a
[1:15:21] you meet god one time you really meet
[1:15:24] him one time you give your all one time
[1:15:26] he'll transform your life you'll never
[1:15:28] be the same person you'll just become
[1:15:30] more like him from that day on
[1:15:33] amen so this word rule it means a
[1:15:36] definitely a bounded or fixed space
[1:15:38] within the limits of which one's power
[1:15:40] of influence is
[1:15:42] confined
[1:15:44] and it's this one's sphere of activity
[1:15:48] so this is what a rule is
[1:15:50] right so it's a sphere of activity so
[1:15:53] this is you could say it's a realm in
[1:15:55] which people live
[1:15:56] so if you're a son and daughter of god i
[1:15:58] just trust you're following this now you
[1:16:00] know if we're a son or daughter of god
[1:16:01] we're walking after a certain rule we're
[1:16:03] in a certain sphere
[1:16:05] and it's not the sphere of demons it's
[1:16:07] not the sphere of unbelief it's not the
[1:16:10] sphere of skepticism and it's not the
[1:16:12] sphere of just just being religious no
[1:16:14] it's a sphere of being a son or daughter
[1:16:16] of god being in joint a joint heir with
[1:16:19] jesus christ being seated in heavenly
[1:16:21] places in christ jesus now if you're
[1:16:23] living in that sphere i mean every devil
[1:16:26] must obey your voice right all of hell
[1:16:29] must obey what you say
[1:16:32] hallelujah nothing can stand before you
[1:16:35] amen isaiah would say that you know no
[1:16:37] weapon formed against thee shall prosper
[1:16:40] so that means there'll be weapons formed
[1:16:41] against me but they shall not prosper i
[1:16:44] mean if you're a son or daughter of god
[1:16:45] sure every gun of hell can be fully
[1:16:47] automatic at your face amen but it's not
[1:16:49] going to prosper against you but it's
[1:16:51] going to fall at your feet
[1:16:53] hallelujah the yeah yeah it's like david
[1:16:55] would say in psalms 27 and and maybe
[1:16:58] we'll just go there shall we
[1:17:00] let's go to psalms 27.
[1:17:02] this morning
[1:17:05] we're gonna you know
[1:17:07] if we can just realize who we are
[1:17:09] hallelujah
[1:17:11] the apostle paul knew who he was the
[1:17:13] prophet knew who he was
[1:17:15] amen if we could just realize what we
[1:17:16] are now
[1:17:18] now we are the sons and daughters of god
[1:17:20] right now
[1:17:21] hallelujah
[1:17:23] psalm 27
[1:17:28] and verse one now this we know brother
[1:17:30] brown when he preached the rapture
[1:17:32] message he didn't go to first
[1:17:33] thessalonians four or first corinthians
[1:17:36] but he went here
[1:17:38] and he and to me he's speaking of this
[1:17:40] is the condition of the people that are
[1:17:41] in that actually enraptured condition
[1:17:44] this is the condition because actually
[1:17:46] it's not a you know to go on the rapture
[1:17:48] it's not am i am i mentally aware it's
[1:17:50] happening
[1:17:51] you know am i having a good day today am
[1:17:54] i feeling happy enough you know
[1:17:56] i love the two on the way to emmaus you
[1:17:58] know mondevins are made clear by
[1:18:00] prophecy luke 24 the two on the way to
[1:18:02] emmaus here are two believers now yeah
[1:18:05] the devil keeps saying you've said this
[1:18:06] before i'm going to say it again noah
[1:18:08] preached for 120 years didn't matter
[1:18:10] what angle he came out he ended up with
[1:18:12] the world is going to be flooded with
[1:18:14] water this arc is the only place of
[1:18:16] safety you better get in i don't know
[1:18:18] how many church services he had i don't
[1:18:20] know how many street meetings he had but
[1:18:22] didn't matter where he started that's
[1:18:23] where he ended
[1:18:25] right so he repeated himself a lot but
[1:18:26] his message was very important right so
[1:18:29] it's the same thing with you and i amen
[1:18:31] this message we have is vital
[1:18:33] but brother braham said that these
[1:18:34] modern events that you see right now are
[1:18:36] made clear by prophecy and that prophecy
[1:18:38] is luke chapter 24 and the condition of
[1:18:41] the believers there when the
[1:18:42] resurrection is going on they're not
[1:18:44] skipping they're not jumping they're not
[1:18:46] shouting they're not happy they're not
[1:18:48] even having an average day they're
[1:18:49] having a horrible day why because the
[1:18:51] one they believed would be the messiah
[1:18:53] had been crucified right as the third
[1:18:56] day that he's been in the grave you know
[1:18:58] the ministry had had had locked
[1:19:00] themselves away in the upper room the
[1:19:02] church treasurer had committed suicide
[1:19:05] it just had all fallen apart
[1:19:07] and so here they were broken-hearted
[1:19:10] walking on the way to emmaus they don't
[1:19:12] realize that paradise has been emptied
[1:19:14] out they don't realize that satan
[1:19:16] doesn't have the keys to his own house
[1:19:17] anymore they don't realize you know that
[1:19:19] the king of glory has conquered hell
[1:19:21] death in the grave they have no they
[1:19:23] have no real eye yo they don't realize
[1:19:25] what's going on in another realm and
[1:19:27] they're walking along remember they're
[1:19:28] walking in a season of a resurrection
[1:19:31] and they're broken-hearted and then
[1:19:33] jesus walks with them but he doesn't
[1:19:35] reveal fully who he is and he starts at
[1:19:37] moses
[1:19:38] and he actually it's amazing because you
[1:19:40] know he actually asked them what's wrong
[1:19:42] why are you so sad
[1:19:44] and they're surprised
[1:19:46] what do you mean you don't know what's
[1:19:47] going on
[1:19:48] the whole city the whole nation really
[1:19:50] knew what was going on
[1:19:52] and and you know he says what things
[1:19:54] like he didn't know he was the center of
[1:19:55] it all
[1:19:56] he was the lord is the center of it all
[1:19:58] even today
[1:20:00] you know and he's walking with them even
[1:20:02] pretending like he doesn't know what's
[1:20:03] going on they begin to say oh fools just
[1:20:06] you know slow of heart to belief
[1:20:08] they started at moses
[1:20:10] and he opened the scripture
[1:20:12] to show them fulfilled prophecy in their
[1:20:15] day
[1:20:16] right and the purpose of that wasn't
[1:20:18] just to give them a sermon but the
[1:20:20] purpose of that was to show them they
[1:20:22] are part of that resurrection
[1:20:24] that's why it's so incredible and you
[1:20:25] can't buy it you can't earn it that when
[1:20:27] the word comes forth it burns in your
[1:20:29] heart
[1:20:30] it speaks to you
[1:20:32] hallelujah it does something that that
[1:20:34] no other words do what's that god is
[1:20:36] ministering to you i'm going to pour in
[1:20:38] myself into you i want you to realize
[1:20:40] where you are i mean you're not walking
[1:20:42] along this road broken-hearted and you
[1:20:44] don't understand i'm going to show you
[1:20:45] what's going on and he walked with them
[1:20:48] and he opened the scriptures concerning
[1:20:50] himself and then finally he you know
[1:20:52] then they come to their house and he's
[1:20:54] pretending like he's going to walk on
[1:20:55] and they said no come stay with us
[1:20:57] and then he sits down at the table now
[1:20:59] the head of the house breaks the bread
[1:21:01] so he sat down as the head of the house
[1:21:03] and he broke the bridge so he did
[1:21:05] something he did before he was crucified
[1:21:07] then their eyes came open that's the
[1:21:09] master
[1:21:10] they disappeared but then they ran back
[1:21:12] into jerusalem what was all that
[1:21:14] that was a prophecy
[1:21:16] right
[1:21:17] of modern events
[1:21:19] what is the main modern event that's
[1:21:21] going on
[1:21:22] is it covert
[1:21:24] is it the great reset or whatever's
[1:21:26] going you know no it's not is it is it
[1:21:27] afghanistan is it the horrors that are
[1:21:30] going around in the world no that's not
[1:21:31] the main event
[1:21:33] that's a lot of other things but the
[1:21:35] main event is god is preparing a people
[1:21:37] to go in a rapture
[1:21:39] right this is and and this is why i
[1:21:41] believe we're here today it's god's
[1:21:43] preparing us don't look down and broken
[1:21:46] hearted what you see with your five
[1:21:47] senses those disciples saw jesus die
[1:21:50] they saw him scored they saw him be
[1:21:52] mocked and you know they saw it they
[1:21:54] felt the emotion of the crowd and maybe
[1:21:56] the hatred that was poured out upon him
[1:21:58] they felt the grief they had when they
[1:21:59] saw it happen they saw him give his last
[1:22:02] breath and you know they the five senses
[1:22:04] declared he died
[1:22:06] and their minds were telling them all
[1:22:07] these different things you know that
[1:22:09] broken heart but the lord was walking
[1:22:10] with him to say look beyond what you see
[1:22:14] think beyond what you think
[1:22:17] hallelujah
[1:22:18] and then he breaks the bread
[1:22:20] he does something he did now i'm kind of
[1:22:22] and i feel like i'm standing in a shower
[1:22:23] it's a bit echoey up here you know and
[1:22:26] so
[1:22:26] and so it gets you know it comes to this
[1:22:29] place he breaks the bridge he does
[1:22:30] something before he did before he died
[1:22:32] his eye you know their eyes come open
[1:22:34] and the whole purpose of that is because
[1:22:36] they had to be in the upper room because
[1:22:37] that was part of the resurrection and
[1:22:40] that's why this message has become so
[1:22:41] alive in your soul is because god has
[1:22:44] been ministering to you actually you are
[1:22:46] part of this resurrection
[1:22:48] hallelujah because if you have been
[1:22:50] resurrected from death to life
[1:22:53] hallelujah then you're going to be then
[1:22:55] your body's going to be changed as well
[1:22:56] it's all part of the same process
[1:23:00] amen so that's the main event going on
[1:23:04] praise god he says here the lord is my
[1:23:07] light and my salvation whom shall i fear
[1:23:09] the lord is the strength of my life of
[1:23:11] whom shall i be afraid
[1:23:13] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:23:15] foes came upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:23:18] they stumbled and fell there was a time
[1:23:20] in life where
[1:23:22] david or you could say a believer could
[1:23:24] say when the enemy when the wicked evil
[1:23:26] my enemies and my foes came upon me to
[1:23:28] eat of my flesh i stumbled and fell
[1:23:30] so when the devil came with his
[1:23:31] temptations i fell and stumbled at it
[1:23:34] right but those who are in rapture
[1:23:37] condition have overcoming power
[1:23:40] right
[1:23:41] i mean so when the wicked even my
[1:23:43] enemies he says who shall i be afraid
[1:23:45] he's the strength of my life what shall
[1:23:46] i be afraid of
[1:23:48] see the devil you know there's so much
[1:23:50] fear in the world
[1:23:52] it's almost like you have to be afraid
[1:23:53] of something
[1:23:55] no no the only one to be afraid of don't
[1:23:58] be afraid of that which can destroy the
[1:23:59] body the scripture says but fear him
[1:24:01] that can destroy the body and the soul
[1:24:03] in hell
[1:24:05] so we shouldn't be afraid
[1:24:08] right are you all with me we should
[1:24:10] don't be afraid you're going to realize
[1:24:12] fear is torment fear is from hell
[1:24:15] it has no part in you and i
[1:24:18] so you got to tell that thing to go you
[1:24:20] don't you don't have to put up with it
[1:24:23] i mean the host should encamp against me
[1:24:25] my heart shall not fear though war
[1:24:27] should rise against me and this and this
[1:24:30] will i be confident one thing i have
[1:24:32] just i'm desired with the lord that i
[1:24:33] may seek after i may dwell in the house
[1:24:35] of of the lord all the days of my life
[1:24:38] to behold the beauty of the lord and to
[1:24:40] inquire in his temple for in the time of
[1:24:42] trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:24:44] and the secret place of his tabernacle
[1:24:46] shall he hide me he shall set me up upon
[1:24:48] a rock
[1:24:50] hallelujah so the secret of his
[1:24:51] tabernacle is is being baptized with the
[1:24:53] holy ghost the lord living in your soul
[1:24:55] you're actually sealed into the secret
[1:24:56] place
[1:24:57] and what's that rock he has set our feet
[1:24:59] upon the revelation of who he is
[1:25:03] hallelujah and now shall my head be
[1:25:05] lifted up above my enemies round about
[1:25:06] me therefore will i offer in his
[1:25:08] tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing
[1:25:11] i'll sing praises unto the lord
[1:25:14] hallelujah as the brother brown preaches
[1:25:17] the rapture message he takes that as his
[1:25:18] opening scripture so what is he saying
[1:25:20] this is the condition of the people
[1:25:23] that are ready
[1:25:25] are ready for the rapture ask the
[1:25:27] question are you ready have you really
[1:25:29] met him
[1:25:30] he transformed your life are you now
[1:25:32] living according to his word is his life
[1:25:34] as his word living out of us
[1:25:36] amen
[1:25:38] so now it's a sphere of activity as i
[1:25:41] say we're seated in heavenly places in
[1:25:42] christ jesus is the rule we walk after
[1:25:45] of of the new birth now brother owen
[1:25:47] says in god of this evil age
[1:25:50] he says and the entire word of god
[1:25:52] incomplete was headed up in a body
[1:25:53] called jesus christ and their god made
[1:25:55] me pay for my sins in him there then he
[1:25:58] rose me raised me up with him in the
[1:26:00] resurrection now we are seated with him
[1:26:01] with the power and authority over every
[1:26:03] devil oh if we could only believe what
[1:26:05] god has given but if you're not seated
[1:26:07] there you don't have it and if you're
[1:26:09] seated there and you don't believe it
[1:26:11] and afraid to move you'll never use it
[1:26:13] but if you are seated there you will use
[1:26:15] it for your ordained to do what you do
[1:26:19] amen so if we are really seated there we
[1:26:21] will use that power place of position of
[1:26:23] authority amen and cast the devil out
[1:26:26] hallelujah now this peace that would
[1:26:28] rule
[1:26:30] right so if we so if we walk as many as
[1:26:33] walk according to this rule what is that
[1:26:34] the power of the new birth
[1:26:36] amen peace be on them and mercy and upon
[1:26:38] the israel of god now this peace that
[1:26:41] will be upon us
[1:26:43] it is the messiah's peace
[1:26:46] he said my peace i give unto thee not as
[1:26:47] the world gives remember the devil wants
[1:26:49] to pull us out of this place to make us
[1:26:51] think actually we have no peace no we
[1:26:53] have peace but it's not like worldly
[1:26:55] peace because worldly peace you know
[1:26:57] they think it's just being far away from
[1:26:59] trouble in some tranquil spot and now
[1:27:01] it's peaceful that's not real peace
[1:27:03] that's just removing a trouble
[1:27:05] right but we can have peace in the storm
[1:27:08] i mean we can actually have peace that
[1:27:10] it doesn't matter what's going on in
[1:27:12] life we can just be settled
[1:27:14] amen
[1:27:16] amen
[1:27:18] is that bearing your head in the sand no
[1:27:20] because you know who's in charge this is
[1:27:22] not bearing head and saying kind of
[1:27:23] stuff no you can realize the devil's on
[1:27:25] your case but you got to realize the one
[1:27:27] who's in you is greater than that devil
[1:27:29] amen so that's the messiah's peace it
[1:27:32] says of christianity it is the tranquil
[1:27:34] state of a soul
[1:27:36] assured of its salvation through christ
[1:27:38] and so fearing nothing from god and
[1:27:41] content with its earthly lot of
[1:27:43] whatsoever sort that is that's peace
[1:27:47] right so it's actually the state that
[1:27:48] the soul is assured of its salvation
[1:27:50] through christ
[1:27:51] who's that
[1:27:53] you've got peace
[1:27:54] and you're fearing nothing from god why
[1:27:56] because you know you have a father
[1:27:58] you've got a loving lord jesus that
[1:28:00] actually holds nothing against you
[1:28:01] because he took your judgment that down
[1:28:03] calvary amen hallelujah and you're free
[1:28:07] whom the son is set free is free from
[1:28:08] sin that means i mean shall be free
[1:28:10] indeed right and and is content with its
[1:28:13] earthly lot whatsoever sort that is so
[1:28:15] whatever state we find ourselves in we
[1:28:17] should be content
[1:28:21] amen so there's peace
[1:28:25] hallelujah
[1:28:26] brother brown would dramatize when the
[1:28:28] lord is taken up there in um acts
[1:28:30] chapter one after he spoken to his
[1:28:31] disciples he says and he and as he
[1:28:34] begins to speak i begin to see daylight
[1:28:36] come under his feet what's the matter
[1:28:37] god's showing his power he's raising up
[1:28:40] what is he he's justifying every law of
[1:28:42] gravitation he's being lifted up why is
[1:28:44] it he's the creator of gravitation and
[1:28:46] here he is he ascends on up till he gets
[1:28:49] up on high and he sets down quietly at
[1:28:51] the feet of the majesty on high glory to
[1:28:53] god there he is with all power and
[1:28:55] heavens and earth in his hands not even
[1:28:57] one little wave can move on the ocean
[1:29:00] without he permits it
[1:29:02] there's his power hallelujah and that
[1:29:04] power of that same thing working in us
[1:29:07] to make us new creatures in christ jesus
[1:29:09] oh brother that's where the power comes
[1:29:11] as our faith brings down our faith which
[1:29:13] is love it casts away all fear
[1:29:16] amen that we think god can't keep his
[1:29:18] word but when i saw the very love and
[1:29:21] grace is is christ and it brings him
[1:29:23] right down to us that mighty power of
[1:29:26] god begins to work into the church love
[1:29:29] that conquers i'll tell you love is the
[1:29:31] most important thing there is in the
[1:29:33] world there's nothing that will take its
[1:29:35] place
[1:29:36] is love
[1:29:37] i mean so there's not one wave that can
[1:29:39] move without his permission
[1:29:41] hallelujah he's in control of everything
[1:29:45] amen
[1:29:46] and that same powers and now you and i
[1:29:48] are working in us
[1:29:50] hallelujah
[1:29:51] now the israel of god is a strange term
[1:29:53] i trust you don't mind this kind of a
[1:29:55] study but you know the apostle paul
[1:29:57] makes a phrase but there's so much in it
[1:29:59] right you could spend brother bam says
[1:30:00] like one scripture you said in months on
[1:30:02] it not even touch the sides
[1:30:03] but but but the israel of god
[1:30:06] now the israel of god we know it's not
[1:30:09] just the natural israel but it's the
[1:30:11] spiritual israel
[1:30:12] of of the believers who are birthed into
[1:30:14] the kingdom right because we are the
[1:30:16] spiritual israel
[1:30:17] amen justice is a natural israel and
[1:30:19] they'll have their day of grace after
[1:30:21] we've gone i mean we know they'll have
[1:30:23] three and a half years where the lord
[1:30:24] will will reveal himself there you know
[1:30:26] through through the two witnesses we
[1:30:28] know those things but you know the
[1:30:29] israel of god the word israel
[1:30:32] is actually from the word uh juriel
[1:30:36] which means he will rule as god
[1:30:39] amen and so now if there's an israel of
[1:30:43] god
[1:30:44] which is actually means that he will
[1:30:46] rule as god now how is that ever going
[1:30:49] to take place unless god comes and
[1:30:51] dwells in you and i
[1:30:52] i mean so god remember he has the final
[1:30:54] say
[1:30:56] in everything he has the final say
[1:30:59] nothing can get past him everything must
[1:31:01] ask his permission he has total dominion
[1:31:04] he has total power he doesn't have to
[1:31:07] negotiate you know this great contest
[1:31:09] between god and satan it's not a chess
[1:31:11] game
[1:31:12] the devil may think it's a chess game if
[1:31:14] i move here then he'll move here i'll
[1:31:16] take him here and i i do this i'll fake
[1:31:18] moving here then i'll you know it's like
[1:31:19] it's not a strategy in that way to god
[1:31:22] god decrees his word and then he makes
[1:31:25] it come to pass
[1:31:26] the devil thinks it's a chess game well
[1:31:28] you know if i get the believers to do
[1:31:29] this and then they'll do this and i'll
[1:31:31] get them to do this and they'll fail
[1:31:32] here and do this and you know that's not
[1:31:34] how god works
[1:31:36] god has decreed something
[1:31:38] he's spoken his word forth
[1:31:40] and nothing will stop it coming to place
[1:31:43] coming into manifestation
[1:31:45] hallelujah
[1:31:46] amy why because he he is god he's the
[1:31:49] lord god almighty so now if we are the
[1:31:52] israel of god that we will rule as god
[1:31:55] what will we have dominion over satan
[1:31:59] all of hell
[1:32:01] unbelief
[1:32:02] even this even the elements that make up
[1:32:05] this body
[1:32:06] i mean all those things will come
[1:32:07] subject
[1:32:09] i mean why because we have a dominion
[1:32:12] hallelujah
[1:32:14] amen
[1:32:16] now do you know a person who's really
[1:32:18] been born again is a miracle
[1:32:21] we you become a walking miracle
[1:32:24] right some people say the days of
[1:32:26] miracles have passed no because no no
[1:32:29] they can't be because i've seen people
[1:32:31] that have been really actually received
[1:32:32] a whole new nature they've actually
[1:32:34] become they may be living in the same
[1:32:36] house but they're totally different
[1:32:37] people seeing god literally transform a
[1:32:39] soul i mean that's a miracle and that's
[1:32:41] the greatest miracle that there is
[1:32:44] because that's an eternal miracle amen
[1:32:46] someone who gets healed of sickness they
[1:32:48] can get sick again even those who are
[1:32:50] raised from the dead they die again
[1:32:52] right but but a soul that's sealed away
[1:32:54] in christ be made a new creature that is
[1:32:56] the greatest miracle now that does not
[1:32:58] mean we we we we don't believe for
[1:33:00] healing i believe in divine healing why
[1:33:02] because jesus purchased on calvary i
[1:33:05] believe in the resurrection of the dead
[1:33:06] why it was purchased that day on calvary
[1:33:08] i believe the devil being cast out why
[1:33:10] because the blood loses the devil from
[1:33:12] people's lives so i believe in all those
[1:33:14] things i believe in prophecy speaking in
[1:33:16] tongues gifts are discernment all those
[1:33:18] things all that's in the word so it's
[1:33:19] for me
[1:33:20] right why on earth would i take a
[1:33:22] blessing cut it in half and say i don't
[1:33:24] want this i i want the whole thing
[1:33:26] amen whoever got a christmas present or
[1:33:28] a birthday present that i really wanted
[1:33:30] and just keep half of it
[1:33:32] i've never seen anyone like that i keep
[1:33:34] the whole thing even when i used to have
[1:33:36] lego when i was a kid it's actually
[1:33:37] still like have it you know i kept the
[1:33:39] box and everything
[1:33:41] hallelujah i didn't throw that away i
[1:33:43] got the instruction manual the box i got
[1:33:44] everything
[1:33:46] why because i want the whole blessing
[1:33:49] right same thing with the word just
[1:33:50] don't take part of it take the whole
[1:33:52] thing
[1:33:53] amen everything that
[1:33:55] god has given to us i want
[1:33:58] he says and you must be born again now
[1:34:00] what kind of a nature have you got then
[1:34:02] brother braham his nature
[1:34:04] if i had my father's nature then i'll do
[1:34:07] the things my father did
[1:34:09] but now that i'm born again it depends
[1:34:11] on who my father was
[1:34:13] if you're just born in the church you've
[1:34:15] got a church father you can call him
[1:34:17] father if you want to you can call him
[1:34:20] anything you want to because he's your
[1:34:21] father but if your father is god
[1:34:24] and you're born in the family of god you
[1:34:26] seek those things that pertain to god
[1:34:29] that's what the apostle paul did amen
[1:34:32] that's right then you are god's child
[1:34:34] your nature is god's nature then when
[1:34:37] some o hear them say some say
[1:34:40] oh our church believes that days and
[1:34:42] miracles has passed how could you
[1:34:44] believe the days of miracles is past
[1:34:46] when the very nature of god is in you
[1:34:48] when he is altogether miracle his
[1:34:51] nature's miracle his habits miracle his
[1:34:53] whole being is miracle how can you be
[1:34:56] anything else but miracle your new birth
[1:34:58] is miracle your new life is miracle even
[1:35:01] your nature's a miracle how can you look
[1:35:04] back and say them things are dead is
[1:35:06] that right see you're a new creature a
[1:35:08] new creation
[1:35:09] sure
[1:35:10] hallelujah so how can we believe that
[1:35:12] all things are not possible because we
[1:35:14] are a miracle
[1:35:16] hallelujah
[1:35:18] amen
[1:35:19] amen
[1:35:20] hallelujah he says an abraham seed what
[1:35:22] are you scared about are you afraid to
[1:35:24] take his word for anything don't be
[1:35:26] afraid
[1:35:28] call the thing right i am an ear to this
[1:35:31] oh i know i don't deserve it
[1:35:33] we know we don't deserve it right
[1:35:35] but i'm an ear
[1:35:37] hallelujah i mean it's like if i had the
[1:35:39] richest just say if
[1:35:41] the richest guy in the world was my
[1:35:43] uncle
[1:35:44] and you know
[1:35:47] he dies
[1:35:48] and then i fall heir to some of his
[1:35:50] fortune
[1:35:51] did i earn it
[1:35:53] did i make it
[1:35:54] right did i have any part of any of it
[1:35:57] no but because i'm an heir to what he
[1:35:59] has given me it's mine
[1:36:01] right it's the same thing with the lord
[1:36:03] do we deserve it
[1:36:05] do we earn it
[1:36:06] right do we merit it in any way no but
[1:36:08] we're in his will
[1:36:11] right and he has bequeathed certain
[1:36:13] things to you and i
[1:36:15] hallelujah so do we deserve it no but
[1:36:17] i'm in here anyhow because i'm an ear i
[1:36:19] receive it amen that's it there you are
[1:36:23] because i'm an ear that's it we're an
[1:36:24] air of salvation we're heir of the holy
[1:36:27] spirit i'm an heir because jesus paid

[1:36:44] heir of salvation purchase of god born

[1:36:48] our story
[1:36:50] hallelujah i'm an heir to it what about
[1:36:52] the salvation of my family do i deserve
[1:36:54] it no but i've fallen into it
[1:36:56] healing deliverance all those things
[1:36:57] we're falling into it
[1:36:59] hallelujah it's mine
[1:37:02] praise the lord so we should rejoice in
[1:37:04] those things do we deserve it no but
[1:37:06] we're in here
[1:37:08] amen if we're an error joint here with
[1:37:10] christ the scripture tells us amen so
[1:37:12] we're an heir to every promise
[1:37:15] this is walking
[1:37:16] after the rule of the power of the new
[1:37:18] birth
[1:37:19] right we're here to it now
[1:37:23] paul would say earlier in galatians he
[1:37:25] would take the um he would take the
[1:37:27] allegory he would say speaking of of of
[1:37:30] the child your hey guys child which is a
[1:37:32] child of the bondwoman and the child of
[1:37:35] sarah who is the child of the promise
[1:37:37] it say tell me what are ye that desire
[1:37:40] to be under the lord do you not hear
[1:37:42] the law for it's written that abraham
[1:37:44] had two sons
[1:37:46] the one by one bond made the other by a
[1:37:48] free woman this is in galatians 4 and 22
[1:37:50] i just read verse 23 but he who was of
[1:37:53] the bondwoman was born after the flesh
[1:37:55] but he that was of the free woman was by
[1:37:57] promise which things are an allegory for
[1:38:00] these are the two covenants one from the
[1:38:02] from the mount sinai which gendereth to
[1:38:05] bondage which is agar for this agar is
[1:38:07] mount sinai in arabia and antareth to
[1:38:09] jerusalem which now is and is in bondage
[1:38:12] with her children but he says here now
[1:38:15] but jerusalem which is above us free
[1:38:17] which is the mother of us all
[1:38:19] for it is a written rejoice thou baron
[1:38:21] that breaketh not i mean sorry that
[1:38:23] beareth not break forth and cry thou
[1:38:25] that travaileth night for the desolate
[1:38:28] hath many more children than she that
[1:38:29] hath a husband now we brethren as isaac
[1:38:32] was are children
[1:38:34] of
[1:38:35] promise
[1:38:37] but as then he that is born after the
[1:38:39] flesh persecuted him that is born after
[1:38:41] the spirit even so it is now so he's
[1:38:43] saying that we are the children of
[1:38:46] promise
[1:38:47] do you think about this
[1:38:49] a promise
[1:38:51] is something that's announced that's
[1:38:53] going to happen
[1:38:54] right if you promise something to
[1:38:56] someone you're announcing i'm going to
[1:38:58] do that at a certain time that i've
[1:39:00] promised this is going to happen
[1:39:02] right and if it's in your power to do it
[1:39:04] you do it but us being
[1:39:06] mere mortals you know sometimes we
[1:39:07] promise things got to take back the
[1:39:09] promise but god is not that way
[1:39:11] god when he promises something it
[1:39:13] happens
[1:39:15] now we would think of something like
[1:39:16] that as a prophecy
[1:39:19] right because if god says yeah you have
[1:39:22] a prophet says thus saith the lord
[1:39:24] this and this and this and this will
[1:39:25] happen
[1:39:26] he's saying that in a future event this
[1:39:28] is going to happen it's god speaking
[1:39:31] right
[1:39:31] and it happens
[1:39:34] uh this may be very you say this is very
[1:39:36] elementary no no this did wonders to me
[1:39:38] maybe i'm just real simple but now he
[1:39:40] but the apostle paul saying that just as
[1:39:43] isaac was we are the children of promise
[1:39:47] hallelujah so god promised um abraham
[1:39:50] you're gonna have a promise son
[1:39:52] it's going to come
[1:39:54] now we are the children of promise
[1:39:57] as in we are the children of prophecy
[1:40:01] and what i mean is now
[1:40:03] prophecy
[1:40:04] is first announced
[1:40:06] but then god fulfills it
[1:40:09] and then it becomes history
[1:40:11] right
[1:40:12] prophecy becomes history when it's
[1:40:14] fulfilled
[1:40:15] so now god said in his word
[1:40:17] that he's going to have a bride
[1:40:19] without spot or wrinkle wash in the
[1:40:22] blood of the lamb
[1:40:23] amen it says in your revelations 19 let
[1:40:26] us be glad and rejoice for the marriage
[1:40:27] the lamb has come and his wife has made
[1:40:30] herself ready to her would be granted
[1:40:32] she be to raid in fine linen clean and
[1:40:33] white which is the righteousness of
[1:40:35] saints right as a prophecy i remember
[1:40:38] this people when god spoke it forth amen
[1:40:41] there's a people that are there to
[1:40:42] fulfill that prophecy
[1:40:44] so you could say they are the people of
[1:40:47] promise
[1:40:48] of that promise now here we are
[1:40:51] we are the people of promise
[1:40:55] we're the children of promise uh i hope
[1:40:56] this is making sense it made sense to me
[1:40:59] maybe it was too late last night so you
[1:41:01] know but yeah it made sense to me we're
[1:41:03] we're actually a people of promise god
[1:41:05] actually said i'm gonna have a bride
[1:41:06] she's gonna be made in my image made out
[1:41:08] of the word the same material as i am as
[1:41:11] i am a lamb she will be a lamb she'll be
[1:41:13] meek and lowly and gentle and sweet and
[1:41:16] kind and have a have a lamb kind of
[1:41:18] nature
[1:41:19] hallelujah she'll be made in my image
[1:41:21] when i look at her i'll see me in
[1:41:22] feminine form
[1:41:24] hallelujah this was his promise
[1:41:26] and when god gives a promise satan can't
[1:41:29] do nothing to stop it he'll try and
[1:41:31] hinder it sure he did i mean because you
[1:41:33] know sarah couldn't have the child
[1:41:34] they'll think rebecca couldn't have a
[1:41:36] child isaac had to actually seek the
[1:41:37] lord for her to have a child yeah and
[1:41:39] you know the seat has always tried to be
[1:41:41] stopped that's naturally now but you see
[1:41:43] nothing could stop it happening
[1:41:46] that was hindered so now in the
[1:41:47] spiritual the devil can fight you
[1:41:50] but it's not going to stop if you're a
[1:41:52] child of promise i mean i'm actually
[1:41:54] being birthed into the kingdom because
[1:41:56] why i am the fulfillment of a promise
[1:41:58] that god has given that he's going to
[1:42:00] have a bride
[1:42:01] made in his image without spot or
[1:42:03] wrinkle that means the devil can fight
[1:42:05] you amen but god is there to fulfill his
[1:42:07] word in your life hallelujah and that's
[1:42:10] why people rejoice in the scripture when
[1:42:12] they see the word fulfilled
[1:42:14] amen the part of the reason why
[1:42:17] in in the upper room after the holy
[1:42:19] ghost came they acted like drunk people
[1:42:21] i mean it's because they were rejoicing
[1:42:23] they're actually staggering under the
[1:42:24] impact of this is the fulfillment of
[1:42:26] prophecy and it's not just on some kind
[1:42:29] of national level this is happening in
[1:42:30] me
[1:42:31] hallelujah when joel said i'll pour my
[1:42:33] spirit out upon all flesh i'm i'm part
[1:42:36] of that the handmaids and the young men
[1:42:38] will prophesy dream dreams different
[1:42:39] things they're actually staggering under
[1:42:41] the fact that now actually god was
[1:42:42] dwelling in me
[1:42:44] i mean what was just on the scrolls that
[1:42:46] was a promise was now fulfilled and
[1:42:49] that's why peter could stand and say
[1:42:50] they're not drunk with new wine but this
[1:42:52] is that spoken by the prophet joel what
[1:42:54] do you see right here is a fulfillment
[1:42:56] of prophecy and now it's becoming
[1:42:59] history
[1:43:00] hallelujah and that's why we can i trust
[1:43:03] you gotta stagger a bit when you think
[1:43:05] about what god has done in your life
[1:43:07] hallelujah where he took you from
[1:43:09] wherever you were
[1:43:10] you may be born on a message pew raised
[1:43:12] up but you know or come out of the world
[1:43:14] but there came a day where a spark
[1:43:16] ignited and when god made his word come
[1:43:18] alive and you and you begin to realize i
[1:43:21] am a fulfillment
[1:43:22] how they're because of god's doing i am
[1:43:25] a fulfillment of prophecy and nothing
[1:43:27] can stop it happening
[1:43:29] hallelujah
[1:43:31] amen when we look into revelations 12
[1:43:33] and i'm going to kind of wind up with
[1:43:35] just these two thoughts here revelations
[1:43:37] 12 where it says that the you know that
[1:43:39] that great dragon was cast out that old
[1:43:41] serpent is cast out of heaven called the
[1:43:43] devil and satan which deceiveth the
[1:43:45] whole world this is verse 9 of
[1:43:47] revelations 12. he was cast out into the
[1:43:49] earth and his angels were cast out with
[1:43:51] him and i heard a loud voice saying in
[1:43:53] heaven now has come salvation and
[1:43:55] strength and the kingdom of our god and
[1:43:57] the power of his christ for the accuser
[1:43:59] of our brethren is cast down which
[1:44:01] accused them before our god day and
[1:44:02] night and they overcame him
[1:44:05] hallelujah
[1:44:06] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:44:08] of their testimony they loved their love
[1:44:10] not their lives unto the death so there
[1:44:11] was a people god actually promised it
[1:44:14] there'll be a people that overcome the
[1:44:16] devil
[1:44:17] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:44:19] of their testimony
[1:44:20] hallelujah says the people that because
[1:44:22] of the blood of the lamb
[1:44:24] amen they're being washed away new
[1:44:25] creatures they had no sin held against
[1:44:27] them whatsoever amen the
[1:44:29] the old account was settled long ago
[1:44:32] hallelujah and by the word of their
[1:44:34] testimony what's their testimony it's
[1:44:36] what god has done in their lives really
[1:44:38] our testimonies are not ours it's
[1:44:40] actually a testimony of god
[1:44:42] that's what god did it's not what we do
[1:44:43] is what god does
[1:44:45] hallelujah what are they also testifying
[1:44:47] god's word is right
[1:44:48] his promises are true
[1:44:50] amen he's more than able and so god
[1:44:52] promised it
[1:44:54] but down through the ages and here we
[1:44:56] are even now we're a fulfillment of the
[1:44:58] scripture
[1:45:00] why because we're the children of
[1:45:01] promise
[1:45:03] hallelujah
[1:45:05] hallelujah now
[1:45:08] i just finished with this here
[1:45:10] in revelations 9
[1:45:13] see we're going to realize that we're
[1:45:14] not alone in this battle
[1:45:16] we're not alone in this battle there's
[1:45:18] far more in this room than just you and
[1:45:20] i here with our distancing things you
[1:45:22] know there's angels gathered
[1:45:24] hallelujah if really if they were
[1:45:26] material like like our kind of material
[1:45:28] come
[1:45:29] we'd have to go meet on the field over
[1:45:31] there
[1:45:32] we'd have to have a big open air we need
[1:45:34] a real big place why because angels of
[1:45:35] god gather
[1:45:36] holy we're actually surrounded by a
[1:45:38] cloud of witnesses cheering us on in
[1:45:40] another realm you can do it
[1:45:42] we did it you can do it
[1:45:44] oh yeah we did it by the blood lamb what
[1:45:46] about testimony we overcame in our age
[1:45:48] but now you've got to overcome in your
[1:45:49] age i mean you've got to finish this lap
[1:45:51] you've got to finish this race we're
[1:45:53] waiting for you to finish
[1:45:54] oh we're here for a purpose amen we're
[1:45:56] not here just to occupy time we're not
[1:45:58] here to occupy time we're here to
[1:46:00] manifest the word of god
[1:46:02] hallelujah
[1:46:04] amen so now satan in revelations 9 it
[1:46:06] says and i saw a star fall from heaven
[1:46:10] unto the earth and to him was given the
[1:46:12] key of the bottomless pit now we won't
[1:46:14] read the rest of the of the chapter but
[1:46:16] it speaks about hell coming open and a
[1:46:18] hundred thousand thousand demons loose
[1:46:20] from the river euphrates and you just
[1:46:22] look back from 100 years from now till
[1:46:23] now we can see that
[1:46:25] hell's empties itself upon the earth
[1:46:27] i mean between the first and second
[1:46:28] world first world war second world war
[1:46:30] hell came open but i want you to notice
[1:46:32] that this star fell
[1:46:35] he did not choose to come down
[1:46:37] like if someone's climbing a tree and
[1:46:39] they fall they don't choose to fall they
[1:46:41] fall
[1:46:42] right either their grip becomes loose or
[1:46:44] someone pushes them something happens
[1:46:46] that's outside their control and they
[1:46:47] fall
[1:46:48] who's experienced that
[1:46:50] yeah i trust your tree climbers when
[1:46:52] you're young right but but you fall
[1:46:54] because something happens that's outside
[1:46:56] your control so now this star
[1:46:59] that falls we know this is satan
[1:47:02] right but he is he falls he doesn't
[1:47:04] choose to come down an open hell upon
[1:47:06] the earth he's pushed
[1:47:08] he's cast out
[1:47:10] hallelujah but then now when after after
[1:47:13] john sees this happen
[1:47:15] it's not just now hell is here upon the
[1:47:17] earth and now we're helpless because god
[1:47:19] don't work that way
[1:47:21] because as he saw health come open these
[1:47:23] things happen then the first word of
[1:47:25] revelation is 10 is and i saw another
[1:47:28] mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:47:30] so as satan fell
[1:47:32] right now god himself has come down upon
[1:47:35] the earth because this is christ in
[1:47:36] angelic form he comes down he doesn't
[1:47:39] fall he's not pushed he doesn't come
[1:47:41] down because something's outside his
[1:47:42] control no he chooses i'm going to step
[1:47:44] down
[1:47:45] upon the earth i'm going to anoint my
[1:47:47] people i mean to overcome all the forces
[1:47:50] of hell i'm gonna walk in them
[1:47:52] hallelujah his feet were his pillars of
[1:47:54] fire where are those pillars of fire
[1:47:56] there and you and i
[1:47:57] i mean we are the part of the body of
[1:47:59] christ upon the earth
[1:48:01] hallelujah so the devil fell but the
[1:48:03] lord themself came down in angelic form
[1:48:06] why to fight this battle for you and i
[1:48:08] we're not alone in this fight friends
[1:48:10] amen but we've got to realize we've got
[1:48:11] to walk after the rule of being
[1:48:14] of the new creation
[1:48:16] not after i do this or i don't do that
[1:48:18] no no no it's not those things don't
[1:48:20] avail it's being a new creature in jesus
[1:48:22] christ because if you are truly a new
[1:48:24] creature in jesus christ you will
[1:48:26] fulfill the word you will live it
[1:48:28] right it's not in your own strength
[1:48:30] keeping it there's a life of nature in
[1:48:31] you that fulfills it
[1:48:35] amen
[1:48:36] i think we'll just leave it there
[1:48:39] but you're glad
[1:48:43] aren't you glad that
[1:48:45] wait let's just go here sir sorry
[1:48:48] slides are dangerous things it says in
[1:48:49] first john 3
[1:48:51] behold what manner of love that the
[1:48:52] father has bestowed upon us
[1:48:55] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:48:57] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:48:59] because it knew him not beloved now we
[1:49:01] are the sons of god and it does not yet
[1:49:04] appear what we we shall be
[1:49:06] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:49:08] shall be like him we shall see him as he
[1:49:10] is
[1:49:11] and every man that hath this hope in him
[1:49:15] purify himself even as he is pure
[1:49:18] so now
[1:49:20] the prophet tells us the lord is
[1:49:21] actually appearing among us now his
[1:49:23] spirit is appearing among the church
[1:49:25] right and when we see him as he is in
[1:49:27] this way
[1:49:29] what does it do it causes us it says we
[1:49:32] shall be like him when we see him as he
[1:49:34] is we're actually seeing him appear
[1:49:35] among us who believes that
[1:49:37] the spirit of god moving that's him
[1:49:39] appearing there's difference between an
[1:49:40] appearing and a coming we know that
[1:49:42] right but every man that has
[1:49:45] this hope in him
[1:49:46] purifies himself even as he is pure well
[1:49:49] how do we purify ourselves what to me
[1:49:52] that means we lay aside every weight and
[1:49:54] sin that so easily besets us and let us
[1:49:56] run this race that is set before us
[1:49:59] so it's actually exactly where you see
[1:50:00] this the lord's appearing among us
[1:50:03] hallelujah see everyone who has this now
[1:50:05] this hope is actually it's a expectation
[1:50:08] with pleasure
[1:50:10] you see when he is appearing actually
[1:50:11] realize actually we're in the cycle the
[1:50:13] process of the coming of the lord the
[1:50:14] rapture cycle
[1:50:16] so so everyone who has that hope within
[1:50:18] them
[1:50:19] they say i'm going to get rid of these
[1:50:22] these weights i'm going to lay aside
[1:50:24] this sin
[1:50:26] i want to run this race we're right at
[1:50:28] the end this is exciting
[1:50:30] hallelujah
[1:50:32] amen this is how we should be he says
[1:50:35] and ashamed over at the end time
[1:50:37] glorious hour the appearing of of the
[1:50:38] lord jesus he said there shall be
[1:50:40] earthquakes and divers places perplex of
[1:50:43] time distress between nations men's
[1:50:45] hearts failing and fear said when these
[1:50:47] things begin to happen raise up your
[1:50:49] head your redemption is drawing nigh
[1:50:53] so that's the most important thing
[1:50:55] all these things must needs be this is
[1:50:57] end time conditions
[1:50:58] but lift up your head knowing your
[1:51:00] redemption draws nigh
[1:51:02] amen
