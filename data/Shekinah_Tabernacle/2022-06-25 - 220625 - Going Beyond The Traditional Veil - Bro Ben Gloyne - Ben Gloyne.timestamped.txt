[4:21] [Music]
[4:26] Good morning.
[4:29] How are you? You good?
[4:31] That's good. It's um it's good to be uh
[4:37] alive. Who's happy to be alive this
[4:38] morning?
[4:41] [Music]
[4:46] I saw a little um uh small video and it
[4:50] was the this Korean man with the highest
[4:54] recorded IQ
[4:56] in the world presently.
[5:00] And one of the things he believes is
[5:02] that there is a God and that Jesus
[5:04] Christ is the king.
[5:06] Usually
[5:08] it's hidden from the wise and prudent
[5:11] and revealed to babes, but in this case
[5:13] the
[5:15] I guess it's an interesting thought
[5:18] because you know someone with the
[5:21] world's highest IQ
[5:23] that
[5:25] has a grasp of science and that often it
[5:27] would should lead them away. But in his
[5:29] case, it's led him to realize there is a
[5:31] God and Jesus Christ is the King of
[5:34] Kings. But I'm glad we don't need the
[5:36] highest IQ in the world to understand
[5:38] that we actually just need to be a human
[5:41] and just have this yearning in us. We
[5:43] just know there's more to life than what
[5:46] we see.
[5:48] And and we can come to the Lord with
[5:50] simple faith this morning. Just a simple
[5:53] just just simply come, Lord, you can
[5:55] just meet me this morning. and and the
[5:58] great creator of the universe that's
[6:00] almost too hard to understand would can
[6:02] come down to meet us on our level and
[6:03] and touch our heart this morning.
[6:08] And not only that, the great creator
[6:10] became my savior. The he came down and
[6:13] was one of us and became one of us and
[6:15] and went through what we go through,
[6:18] walk the walk that we walk, thought the
[6:20] things that we think, battle with the
[6:22] things that we battle with. He became
[6:25] like us so we could become like him.
[6:28] Amen. Let's stand this morning.
[6:31] Lord, we thank you that you're not too
[6:33] hard for us to understand or you or that
[6:36] Lord, you understand us because you
[6:38] became one of us, Lord Jesus. And we
[6:41] want to approach you this morning, Lord.
[6:43] And we want to invite you here.
[6:47] And Lord, we recognize the great love
[6:50] that you had for us that you came down
[6:52] and
[6:54] walked where we walked, Lord. You you
[6:57] became one of us. You you face the same
[6:59] challenges we face,
[7:02] Lord. And you died to bring us
[7:04] redemption this morning. And we're so
[7:07] grateful of that, Lord. We're so
[7:09] grateful that the
[7:12] Lord, the vilest offender that truly
[7:14] believes that moment from Jesus, a
[7:16] pardon receives, Lord, that you've
[7:18] extended your grace to mankind, Lord.
[7:20] And we we come this morning to receive
[7:21] that grace, to receive that mercy, Lord,
[7:24] to receive your your spirit in our
[7:26] lives, Lord, to receive your refreshing.
[7:29] So, we just pray you'd bless us this
[7:31] morning by your spirit, Lord. May you
[7:33] move in a powerful way in our midst,
[7:34] Lord. May you feel welcome to dwell here
[7:36] with us this morning. Lord, as we just
[7:39] come to worship you and to praise you
[7:40] and to hear your word, Lord, and we
[7:43] don't come with any intention other than
[7:44] just to worship you and to praise you
[7:46] and to just receive what you have for us
[7:47] and to Lord humble ourselves before you
[7:50] this morning, Lord Jesus, we just want
[7:52] to pray a blessing upon those that
[7:53] couldn't be here, upon those that are
[7:54] streaming, and we just commit the
[7:56] service to your hands in Jesus name.
[7:58] Amen. Amen. Who's walking in victory
[8:00] this morning? Hands up if you are. So,
[8:03] everyone put your hand up.
[8:05] [Laughter]
[8:07] That's how it works. Because Jesus set
[8:12] me absolutely free. He died on Calvary
[8:17] and he gave me liberty. Oh, Jesus set me
[8:22] absolutely free. I'm going to pray one
[8:26] more time. Oh, Jesus set me. Jesus set
[8:31] me absolutely free. He died on Calvary
[8:36] and he gave me liberty.
[8:40] Jesus sets me absolutely free. I'm going
[8:44] to praise
[8:46] his hope. That's enough to make me
[8:50] That's enough to make me sing and shout.
[8:55] That's enough to make me dance about.
[8:59] All my sins he took away. All my nights
[9:02] he turned to day.
[9:05] That's enough to make me. That's enough
[9:08] to make me. That's enough to make me
[9:12] sing. Jesus sent me. Jesus sent me
[9:17] absolutely free. He died on Calvary and
[9:22] he gave me liberty.
[9:25] Jesus set me absolutely free. I'm going
[9:30] to pray
[9:32] his holy name. That's enough to make me
[9:35] That's enough to make me sing and shout.

[10:16] That's enough to make me. That's enough
[10:20] to make me That's enough to make me
[10:24] sing.
[10:27] Amen. Praise the Lord. Christians are
[10:28] the smartest people in the world because
[10:30] we're so positive. You know, have you
[10:32] heard all those silly songs that are so
[10:34] negative and people get into that, you
[10:36] know? They sing songs about all this
[10:38] negative stuff and it just brings their
[10:39] whole life down and you think and that's
[10:40] intelligent.

[17:07] Amen. You can take your seats this
[17:09] morning as um we've got sister Jenny has
[17:11] got a special just as she's coming up. I
[17:14] wanted to just sing the that verse a
[17:17] second time.
[17:18] My God delivered Israel
[17:22] because you can bet every dollar you've
[17:24] got that Israel is going to stand till
[17:25] the end of time.
[17:29] And and and
[17:31] you can come up, Sister Jenny. Well,
[17:33] she's not that we're gambling, but you
[17:37] know, like God will prove that he's the
[17:39] king of kings. No matter what armies
[17:41] come against Israel, it doesn't matter
[17:42] what happens. Israel is going to stand
[17:44] there. They're never going to be
[17:45] defeated. And they're such a tiny little
[17:47] country sitting there in the middle of
[17:49] all their enemies that theoretically
[17:51] should not have a hope of existing.
[17:54] They they're tiny. I think we are
[17:56] probably bigger than them. And yet the
[17:58] the all their enemies about them can't
[18:00] overtake them. They just no matter what
[18:01] they throw at them. And that's that's a
[18:04] type of you. You're spiritual Israel. No
[18:06] matter you're encamped about with all
[18:08] your enemies, you'll never be
[18:09] overthrown. As long as they stand,
[18:11] you'll stand. Amen.
[18:17] [Music]
[18:21] Well, I've been turned around, but I've
[18:25] never been lost.
[18:28] Seen the water get trled,
[18:32] but we walked across.
[18:35] When my knees were shaking,
[18:39] you held my hand.
[18:43] turning my problems
[18:46] to a promised land.
[18:51] Lead on, good shepherd, I'll follow on
[18:56] my days.

[35:15] brother Isaac. Amen. Thank you, Jenny,
[35:16] for the special. Appreciate that. Amen.
[35:18] God bless you all. Good to have everyone
[35:20] here. Amen. Great to have brother Judy
[35:21] here. God bless you, bro. Welcome. Amen.
[35:23] Praise the Lord. Amen. So, just a
[35:26] reminder, we got a youth service at
[35:27] around 2 p.m. this afternoon. Amen. So,
[35:29] we got Reuben and and David speaking.
[35:31] So, we're looking for and myself, too.
[35:33] So, yeah, we're looking forward to the
[35:34] first two. Anyway, let's um let's take
[35:37] uh the scripture
[35:39] uh this morning. We're going to go to
[35:42] Matthew chapter 27.
[35:45] And um
[35:48] Amen. Yeah, it's a good question.
[35:49] Brother Isaac asked, "Who's happy to be
[35:51] alive?"
[35:52] Amen. Yeah, I think the scripture says,
[35:55] "Shall the dead praise thee?" No. Those
[35:58] who have life will praise the Lord. And
[36:00] the scripture says, "Let everything that
[36:01] has breath so that you'll breathe
[36:03] right." Praise ye the Lord. Okay. So,
[36:07] amen. So, Matthew 27:50-4.
[36:16] Amen. So, I'm just kind of just start
[36:19] enjoying the songs and forget you got to
[36:21] turn things on and get ready and, you
[36:23] know, so just kind of loading this while
[36:26] I've got that. So, we're all we've all
[36:28] turned. We're all happy. All right. So,
[36:31] Matthew 27-54.
[36:33] Jesus, when he had cried again with a
[36:35] loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And
[36:37] behold, the veil of the temple was rent
[36:39] and twain from top to the bottom. And
[36:42] the earth did quake, and the rocks rent,
[36:44] and the graves were opened, and many
[36:46] bodies of the saints which slept arose,
[36:48] and came out of the graves after his
[36:49] resurrection, and went into the holy
[36:51] city, and appeared unto many. Now when
[36:54] the centurion so now when the centurion
[36:56] and they that were with him watching
[36:57] Jesus saw the earthquake and those
[36:59] things that were done they feared
[37:01] greatly saying truly this was the son of
[37:04] God. Then we're going to go to Hebrews
[37:06] chapter 10 and read from verses uh 16-
[37:10] 21
[37:12] uh as well.
[37:21] So it says here,
[37:24] I mean the book of Hebrews is a
[37:25] wonderful book. You know, it's hard many
[37:28] times where to start and stop right with
[37:30] the scripture. But if you go read
[37:31] chapter 10, you'll have a good time. I
[37:33] believe he says, "This is the covenant
[37:34] that I will make with them after those
[37:36] days." So the them is you. Okay, let's
[37:39] make this personal to them as you say
[37:41] the Lord. I'll put my laws into their
[37:43] hearts and their minds will I write them
[37:45] and their sins and iniquities will I
[37:47] remember no more. Now where remission of
[37:49] these is, there is no more offering for
[37:51] sin. Having therefore, brethren, the
[37:53] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[37:56] the blood of Jesus by a new and living
[37:58] way, which he hath consecrated for us
[38:00] through the veil, that is to say, his
[38:02] flesh, and having an high priest over
[38:04] the house of God. Amen. So, I want to
[38:08] speak about the veil is rent and going
[38:10] past the veil of tradition today. Amen.
[38:13] So, let's bow our heads in a word of
[38:14] prayer. If you have a need, you just
[38:15] want to slip your hand up. got a few who
[38:17] are sick, who are not here, want to
[38:18] remember them in prayer and amen. So
[38:20] let's just invite the Lord to where
[38:22] we're at today because he always comes
[38:23] where he's invited. So if you want him
[38:25] to come to your need, to your situation,
[38:27] say, "Lord Jesus, come by my way today."
[38:29] Amen. Gracious Father, we're so
[38:31] thankful, Lord. You've bridged the
[38:33] chasm. Lord, you've done mighty things.
[38:35] Thank you for saving us of our sins.
[38:37] Thank you for giving your life on
[38:38] Calvary that we would receive your life,
[38:41] Lord, eternal life. We praise your name
[38:43] for this day, dear God. We want to just
[38:45] ask as we've read your great holy word
[38:47] Lord. May you the great author now step
[38:49] forward. Anoint it to our hearts Lord.
[38:51] Anoint me speaker. Anoint those
[38:53] listening Lord Jesus here and also those
[38:55] who are streaming. Father may you meet
[38:57] every need among us dear God. May you
[38:59] touch those who are sick and body.
[39:00] Father both both here and streaming Lord
[39:03] Jesus. May you just come by our way.
[39:05] Anoint your word Lord. We surrender our
[39:07] lives into your hands that you'd be
[39:08] glorified in our midst. Lord we thank
[39:10] you for this day in Jesus Christ's name.
[39:12] Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. So you
[39:15] can have your seats this morning. So I
[39:16] want to speak as I said about the so the
[39:19] the veil being rent. Now when Jesus
[39:21] died, we read in the scripture that the
[39:24] veil that was in the temple between the
[39:26] holy place and the holy of holies was
[39:28] rent from top to bottom. Now this veil
[39:31] was quite a was quite a piece of fabric.
[39:34] The um the historian Josephus would say
[39:37] that it was it was um it was estimated
[39:40] to be 4 in thick. which is quite thick,
[39:43] right? And then it was described as
[39:45] being about 60 foot tall and 30 foot
[39:48] wide. The veil that separated the holy
[39:50] of holies from the holy place was
[39:52] incredibly strong, requiring many people
[39:55] to move it. So in other words, no man
[39:57] could rent it in its own physical
[39:59] strength. It took God to rent it from
[40:01] top to bottom. So it's a very thick
[40:03] veil. It obscured the holiest place.
[40:06] And um but the thing is God rent that
[40:08] veil when Jesus died because he was
[40:10] showing that the way into the presence
[40:11] of God was now made open. That under the
[40:14] blood of bulls and goats uh not everyone
[40:17] could go into the presence of God where
[40:18] the where the uh ark of the covenant was
[40:21] where the mercy seat was. It was only
[40:22] the high priest once a year with his
[40:25] with blood could go in. But because of
[40:27] the blood of Jesus Christ now we can
[40:29] enter in and dwell there. So beforehand,
[40:32] if just say if we were back there in the
[40:34] Old Testament, if any of us decided, I'm
[40:36] going to go see the mercy seat today,
[40:37] you would have been struck dead cuz you
[40:39] were not allowed, you not ordained, you
[40:41] were not dressed right, you're not born,
[40:43] right? Because you had to be born as a
[40:45] Levite and the high priest, you had to
[40:46] be, you know, it was your birth that
[40:48] gave you right to go in, right? So, but
[40:50] then, so it was death to go in in the uh
[40:52] in the Old Testament. But now it's death
[40:54] not to go in to the presence of God like
[40:56] that because the blood of Jesus Christ
[40:58] has made a way. Now, we're talking about
[41:01] rending veils. You know, there's a lot
[41:03] of tradition. We have inherited 2,000
[41:07] years of tradition. Whether we like it
[41:09] or not, we say, "Well, we're in the
[41:10] message, but there's a lot of
[41:12] traditional thinking that needs to be
[41:14] kicked out because tradition veils the
[41:16] reality and power of God to the people."
[41:19] Amen. But the veil's been rent today. So
[41:21] there's nothing that's really here that
[41:23] should hinder us from seeing God in
[41:26] reality and the fullness of his power
[41:27] and the reality of his word in our lives
[41:30] because the veil's been rent. Right? We
[41:32] know that the um that the priests after
[41:34] this happened, they spent a bit of time
[41:36] putting that veil back together, but
[41:38] they put it back together. And sadly,
[41:40] man through tradition has actually put a
[41:42] veil between God and man once again. But
[41:44] in this end time, the veil has been rent
[41:47] and the mercy seat, Jesus Christ has
[41:49] come into plain view of the people once
[41:51] again. Because when Jesus was hanging on
[41:53] Calvary, brother Ram says the mercy seat
[41:55] was hanging in plain view on Calvary.
[41:57] Because the mercy seat is not just a
[41:58] it's not a piece of furniture. Actually,
[42:00] that's the shadow or the symbol. The
[42:02] reality is the mercy seat is a person,
[42:03] Jesus Christ. Amen. But now, so he has
[42:06] come into plain view of the people. So
[42:07] this should really change everything in
[42:10] our walk, in our the way we view the
[42:12] world, the way we view ourselves. This
[42:14] changes everything. When the Lord Jesus
[42:16] died on Calvary, it changed everything.
[42:19] It changed this world. It changed hell.
[42:21] It changed It changed the power of
[42:23] Satan. Was totally taken from him. It
[42:25] changed everything because by a new and
[42:28] living way, he's given us a way to come
[42:30] into the very presence of God. I trust
[42:32] everyone's with me today. I mean, we're
[42:34] going to we're going to get rid of some
[42:36] traditions today because tradition holds
[42:38] us back. Tradition hinders us. There's
[42:40] nothing wrong with the believer. There's
[42:42] nothing wrong with God. It's the
[42:43] traditions that get between the believer
[42:45] and God that are the problem. Swing it.
[42:47] But those things are rent. I mean, those
[42:48] things have been divided that we can
[42:50] step through those things in faith into
[42:52] the realities of God. Personally, I
[42:54] believe we've only touched the surface
[42:57] of the reality of his word. That's me.
[42:59] That that's how I feel when you when
[43:02] brother talks about the angel of the
[43:03] Lord coming to him and the mighty things
[43:05] done in his ministry and the reality of
[43:07] the third pull. You know, the third pull
[43:09] is not just, oh, we understand doctrine.
[43:11] Now, that is that is the mechanics of
[43:14] it. The dynamics of it is the power of
[43:16] God living in a people like never
[43:18] before. That is the dynamics of the
[43:20] third pull. And me, you I'm probably
[43:22] sure you picked up on this, but I'm very
[43:24] interested in the dynamics. It's like a
[43:27] car, you know, I don't I'm not really
[43:29] caring too much about specs. I want to
[43:31] sit it and see how fast it goes. I'm
[43:33] interested in the dynamics,
[43:35] right? Just like sailing a yacht. I'm
[43:37] not interested in the in the in the
[43:39] specs. I want to see how fast it can go.
[43:40] how I can ride a wave, how I can catch a
[43:42] surf, and you know the balance of it. I
[43:44] want to test the thing out. That's me,
[43:47] right? And I believe God wants us to be
[43:49] that way with his word. Brother Bram
[43:50] says it's not about the the mechanics
[43:52] don't run the church. It's the dynamics
[43:54] run the church. And the dynamics is the
[43:56] Holy Ghost and the people. That is the
[43:58] dynamics. So now the veil's been rent.
[44:00] So the dynamics are in plain view. Sure,
[44:03] we need the mechanics, but we need the
[44:05] dynamics of his word. So now here's
[44:08] here's a thing that tradition I'm just
[44:10] going to uh I yeah we're just going to
[44:13] read this now. Tradition this is this is
[44:15] this is what Webster tells me tradition
[44:17] is. It's an inherited established or
[44:19] customary pattern of thought, action or
[44:21] behavior such as a religious practice or
[44:24] a social custom. It's a belief or story
[44:26] or a body of beliefs or stories relating
[44:28] to the past that are commonly accepted
[44:30] as historical though not verifiable.
[44:33] Okay. So now it's an I just want to
[44:35] focus on that first first um what do you
[44:38] call it definition it's an inherited or
[44:40] established or customary pattern of
[44:42] thought action or behavior. See the
[44:44] problem is when the church came out of
[44:46] the dark ages it had a very dead
[44:49] approach to God. Oh we got to be
[44:52] reverent. We got to be sincere. You
[44:54] amazing. I find it very strange how how
[44:57] people want to kill the spirit of God
[44:59] out of a church. They don't actually
[45:00] want God to they want to quench the
[45:02] spirit because it seems to be more
[45:04] reverent and holy. I'm going this way
[45:06] with, you know, there there's a reason I
[45:08] want to speak these things. You know,
[45:09] oh, we're going to be more quiet and
[45:10] we're going to have everything just
[45:11] right. And and what they're doing is
[45:13] actually they're allowing a nickel
[45:14] spirit to come in among the believers
[45:16] because the first church had joy
[45:18] unspeakable and full of glory. Amen. And
[45:21] that joy that's unspeakable means you
[45:22] can't actually put it to words the
[45:24] extreme joy that the believer possesses.
[45:27] Amen. And in this day, the believer
[45:28] possesses extreme joy and peace. We're
[45:30] going to come to it soon if you've
[45:32] listened to the mighty God unveiled,
[45:33] right? So, so yeah, but you see the
[45:35] thing is people seem to think of a
[45:36] Catholic idea of a church service as a
[45:39] good way of being. But it's a nickel way
[45:41] of actually just destroying the spirit
[45:44] of God's ability to move. I mean, but
[45:46] the thing is cuz people want to make
[45:48] church more palatable for the person
[45:50] coming off the street. It's like brother
[45:52] Bram said when the first you know when
[45:54] the when you know the first church was
[45:56] birthed and and you know the word became
[45:58] among the Gentiles it came among the
[46:00] slaves came among the poor people and
[46:03] then they got saved and God filled them
[46:04] with the Holy Ghost and transformed
[46:06] their lives and then they begin to speak
[46:08] to their bosses and their owners and all
[46:10] these things and then the then the hire
[46:11] of society started to come into the
[46:13] church and they begin to think how can
[46:15] we make this more polished up and look
[46:17] nicer that it's more acceptable and what
[46:20] did that come to a head cold formal
[46:22] worship eventually. But we're not called
[46:24] to make it palatable for the world. I
[46:26] mean, no, we have a different kind of a
[46:28] worship. We have a different kind of a
[46:29] life which is not meant to be compared
[46:31] to the world and how they do things. How
[46:33] they do things is how they do things.
[46:35] But how God does things in a people is
[46:36] actually very different. Amen. So, we
[46:39] don't want any kind of tradition or way
[46:41] of thinking. You know, it's amazing how,
[46:43] you know, it can become a tradition
[46:44] passed down that we should be negatively
[46:47] minded, that we should always look down
[46:49] on ourselves and because remember a a a
[46:52] veil puts a separation. So now if your
[46:54] thoughts are, well, God is actually a
[46:56] silent God. Sure, he spoke through the
[46:58] prophet and you can hear the prayer
[47:00] lines and God lived in his life and God
[47:02] spoke to him and sure what happened at
[47:04] Isusa Street, God was living there and
[47:06] through different believers through the
[47:07] ages. But with me, I guess I'm living in
[47:09] a different era. And you know, God
[47:11] doesn't speak that way anymore. That's a
[47:13] traditional veil. Trying to make God
[47:15] silent to you. God isn't silent. God
[47:18] speaks a lot. He's a talker. And his
[47:22] words mean something. Praise the Lord.
[47:24] You know, he isn't some silent God that
[47:26] just kind of, you know, you know, you
[47:28] know, it's not like he just, you know,
[47:29] made the world and sat back and see how
[47:31] it's all going to unfold. No, he's the
[47:34] shepherd that leads. Amen. He's He's
[47:36] working in our lives. But you got to you
[47:38] got to get that thinking out of your
[47:40] mind that God's just kind of just kind
[47:41] of just threw me into the river or the
[47:44] stream and seeing how I'm going to go,
[47:45] you know, of life. No, he knows the way
[47:47] you would take, but he's with you in it.
[47:49] Amen. He's not some we so we can't pass
[47:52] down. I you know, I think about the
[47:53] young people a lot. I don't want to pass
[47:55] down to them some kind of yes, we should
[47:57] feel beaten down and contrite and, you
[48:00] know, sad all the time and just trying
[48:02] to scr struggle through. That's not our
[48:04] portion. We've got joy unspeakable, full
[48:07] of glory. Amen. We've got a joy this
[48:09] world can't give us. Amen. And and the
[48:11] world can't take it away. We've got a
[48:13] peace that passes all understanding.
[48:15] Amen. We've got a satisfying portion of
[48:17] God. Amen. We have what the world craves
[48:20] after. But if if there's a veil tries to
[48:23] come between you and God, you'll start
[48:24] acting like them. I say, but it's more
[48:26] humble to say, "Well, I'm just this
[48:28] little church mouse." You ain't a church
[48:30] mouse. You're a lion. Amen. You ain't
[48:32] some church mouse. Oh, you're you're
[48:34] anointed adopted son or daughter of God.
[48:37] I mean, this is what the word produces.
[48:39] It doesn't produce an arrogant people.
[48:41] We ain't arrogant people. Who brought
[48:42] you in in the first place?
[48:45] He did. Who saved you? He did. Who keeps
[48:49] you? He does. Amen. Who's going to
[48:51] change your body? He will. Amen. It's
[48:54] not you or anything you do. That's
[48:56] another veil of self-ability.
[48:59] Amen. That's very much a human veil. You
[49:02] look at all the religions of the world.
[49:04] Well, if I go on this pilgrimage, if I
[49:06] say these prayers, if I go here, if I,
[49:08] you know, and that's Buddhism, Islam,
[49:10] that's Catholicism, it's everything
[49:12] around the world. It says, well, if I do
[49:14] this, if I work myself up into this
[49:16] state, therefore, I'm going to obtain
[49:19] Nana, I'm going to obtain what I need.
[49:21] No, he did it for you. Amen. He held on
[49:24] for you on Calvary. Amen. He conquered
[49:26] hell, death, and grave for you. You
[49:28] don't have to earn anything. He's given
[49:29] it freely. But a traditional veil will
[49:31] try and put put a thing between you
[49:34] thinking I need to earn something. He
[49:36] earned it all.
[49:38] Amen. He earned it all. Like I said a
[49:39] few Wednesdays ago, I just aired it.
[49:41] Amen. I fell air to every divine
[49:43] promise. Oh, but you can't talk like
[49:45] that. Yes, I can. I'm his child. You
[49:48] look at you know my children when
[49:49] they're well any age. Children are
[49:52] demanding. They should be
[49:56] cuz they're children. They know their
[49:58] parents can get them the thing they
[49:59] want.
[50:02] Amen. No parents rejoiced in that
[50:05] comment.
[50:07] But it's true. Dad, I want this and when
[50:10] can we do this and I want to do this.
[50:13] Shouldn't we be like that with God? We
[50:15] know his promises are true. We know he's
[50:18] more than able to perform every divine
[50:19] promise of God. So should we not say
[50:21] God, you know, like the unjust judge,
[50:23] that widow woman, the unjust judge,
[50:25] badgered him until he gave in?
[50:28] Amen. I just want you to think of No.
[50:30] Oh, but no, but that veil of tradition
[50:32] says, "Oh, no, but God is high and ho
[50:34] holy and higher than the heavens, and
[50:35] I'm just this little thing of this worm
[50:38] upon the earth, and how how would he
[50:39] ever listen to me and all these things?"
[50:41] That's a traditional veil. Amen. He rent
[50:43] that veil. There's no gulf between you
[50:45] and him. It's gone. Where did it go? He
[50:49] carried it far away. Amen. Like Samson
[50:51] carried the gates of Gaza about 40 miles
[50:53] uphill. Amen. Far away from where those
[50:56] gates were. And he took the hinges and
[50:58] the and the post with it, too. Amen. So,
[51:00] there's nothing between us and our God.
[51:02] If I start acting silly, well, I just
[51:04] get happy. Okay? But you got to realize
[51:05] that's a veil. Why do we have to put up
[51:07] with that kind of thinking? Well, God's
[51:09] far away and I'm down here and no, he's
[51:11] closer than your next breath. The
[51:13] Apostle Paul said to them, "He's not far
[51:15] from any one of you." Amen. Amen. Oh,
[51:18] but it's what I have done wrong.
[51:21] I'm I'm probably not even going to get
[51:22] very far in this service, but hey,
[51:24] that's fine. You know, there's a
[51:26] tradition
[51:28] that I need to I need to earn something.
[51:33] I've already said that one, haven't I?
[51:35] There's a tradition that we think, well,
[51:37] because this is a problem. This is a big
[51:39] problem because we think it's our it's
[51:42] how good we are make sure we merit
[51:44] something. That's a traditional veil.
[51:47] And there's another veil of the fact is
[51:49] that if if if any of us get sick, well,
[51:51] then we deserved it cuz we did something
[51:53] wrong. That's a traditional veil. Job's
[51:55] friends were veiled by it. They came to
[51:57] Job saying, "Well, you've obviously been
[51:59] a secret sinner, Job. That's why this
[52:01] has happened to you." He had done
[52:02] nothing wrong. God's testimony of Job
[52:04] was he's a perfect man. He's he's the
[52:07] one and only upon the earth. There's
[52:08] none like him. He's without peer. He's
[52:11] without equal. This is Job. And Job was
[52:14] just giving the blood of the lamb and
[52:15] doing his thing and not knowing anything
[52:17] about where he goes and all these
[52:18] things. And God says, "He's perfect.
[52:21] God don't lie. God don't lie. He doesn't
[52:25] embellish anything. He just says it for
[52:26] how it is. Amen. So, so if that was Job
[52:29] under the blood of bulls and goats, how
[52:30] much more you under the blood of Jesus
[52:32] Christ? I mean, where God can testify to
[52:34] his enemy about you. Have you seen my
[52:36] bride? Have you seen these ones in
[52:38] Shakina Tabernacle? It's not just us.
[52:40] It's around the world, but I want to
[52:41] bring it in personal. Have you
[52:43] considered them? They're the apple of my
[52:45] eye. They're perfect. There's none like
[52:47] them. They're without peer. Amen. Why
[52:50] was Job, why was God's testimony of Job
[52:53] like that? Because Job had faith in the
[52:55] blood of the lamb. It wasn't his wisdom.
[52:57] It wasn't him at all. It was the blood
[53:00] that gave God that testimony about him.
[53:02] You know, I was, you know, there I was
[53:03] there at the memorial service for Nana
[53:05] there on um Wednesday. I was trying to
[53:07] read the scripture and I just couldn't
[53:09] read it through my tears. I begin to get
[53:11] thinking, you know, you know, it's like
[53:12] the Lord Jesus when he looks at us, he
[53:14] looks at us through the blood. Amen. And
[53:16] there's things he can't see.
[53:19] Amen. And it's actually it's not just
[53:20] covered, it's annihilated. But through
[53:22] the blood when he looks because red
[53:24] through red, red is white, right? Amen.
[53:26] If you look through something red
[53:28] through something red, it becomes white.
[53:30] And when you look at sin through the
[53:32] blood, it becomes white. It's gone.
[53:35] Amen. So, so God looks at us in such a
[53:37] way, he says, I don't see nothing wrong
[53:39] with them. They're a perfect people. A
[53:41] traditional veil gets us to think, well,
[53:43] we have to be flawless to be perfect. I
[53:46] said it last Sunday. I want to hammer it
[53:47] in because that's a traditional veil.
[53:49] Oh, one day, one day when I don't put a
[53:51] foot wrong, and one day when I never
[53:53] have a negative thought, and one day
[53:54] when I'm this kind of idea, which is not
[53:56] even a real idea, then I've made it. And
[54:00] there was the prophet, and he was an
[54:02] adopted son. The sword came in his hand,
[54:05] the seals came open, and he wanted to go
[54:07] be a trapper in the northern British
[54:09] Columbia cuz he was hurt by people. He
[54:11] developed a complex and he received a
[54:14] word that the angels wanted to look
[54:16] into. John wasn't even allowed to write
[54:17] and it was placed in his hand. Go preach
[54:19] the revelation of the seven seals. So
[54:21] the lamb's going to open the book and
[54:23] after that he developed a complex wanted
[54:24] to run away and just be up in the
[54:26] wilderness by himself doing his own
[54:28] thing. And we think and that was him.
[54:32] What about you? We are people of like
[54:34] passion. We're human. Amen. All right.
[54:39] Some people have already morphed into
[54:40] something else. But you know we're all
[54:42] human be beings, right? So we can't put
[54:44] this thing on a pedestal of a well I've
[54:46] got to become this kind of a way nothing
[54:48] that nothing bothers me no more nothing
[54:50] hurts me no more I'm just in this kind
[54:52] of this nana state where and that's when
[54:55] I've really got joy that's a veil cuz
[54:58] it's making you look at God or look at
[55:00] yourself in the way that God doesn't
[55:02] look at you and doesn't talk about you.
[55:04] So why do we live with that veil of
[55:06] tradition around us?
[55:09] It's been rent. God wants real people.
[55:13] He wants people. He doesn't throw us
[55:15] away because we get up or we get down.
[55:17] There's Elijah praying after Mount
[55:19] Carmel. Lord, take away my life. He's
[55:21] under a juniper tree. Lord, I'm not you.
[55:23] I'm just like the rest of my fathers.
[55:24] I'm no good. This is This was Elijah's
[55:27] testimony of himself. And God says, "No,
[55:30] look, son, you're not like your fathers.
[55:31] You worship me. You didn't bow your knee
[55:33] to bail at all. You did exactly what I
[55:35] told you to do. You're faithful to the
[55:37] call. Amen. And I'm going to take you in
[55:39] a chariot ride later." So you know you
[55:41] know in a rapture you're not like your
[55:42] fathers but you think you are. Why? He
[55:44] was living that veil came over because
[55:47] of disappointment.
[55:49] God's rent that veil.
[55:52] Amen. God's rent that veil. So sickness
[55:54] sickness is not something that you know
[55:56] we think oh I've done something wrong
[55:58] and therefore I'm sick and I deserve it.
[56:00] God don't put sickness on anyone. It's
[56:03] the devil that puts sickness on people.
[56:05] Amen. The church of the living God is
[56:06] called to cast it out. What about if
[56:08] we're not meant to? He'll tell us. But
[56:10] don't think because you put a foot wrong
[56:11] and you're sick and you deserve to be
[56:13] sick and all that. No, that's a
[56:14] traditional veil. That's the veil that
[56:16] was on Job's friends. That's why they
[56:18] accused Job the way they did. As I
[56:20] thought, well, you've done something
[56:21] wrong and therefore this is why and it
[56:22] had nothing to do with it.
[56:25] Amen.
[56:28] Amen. So where where are we?
[56:32] So, we don't want to pass down a
[56:35] pattern, a customary pattern of thought
[56:36] or action or behavior that is contrary
[56:39] to the word. We don't want to pass down
[56:42] a negative way of being. We don't want
[56:44] to pass down a life that our children
[56:46] don't want. Salt is good.
[56:51] Salt is positive.
[56:53] It brings out flavor. It enhances.
[56:56] Right? So, if you're the salt of the
[56:57] earth, Amen. then what's even in you
[56:59] should enhance everything around you.
[57:02] Right? It's not something that's a
[57:04] something that's bitter, something
[57:06] that's nasty,
[57:09] right? Maybe my illustration is not very
[57:11] good, but you know, we should live a
[57:13] life that our pe that people around us
[57:15] want.
[57:17] And it's not and and we're not selling
[57:19] them some bogus idea that when you
[57:20] become a Christian, nothing's going to
[57:22] go wrong. No, we start a battle when we
[57:25] when we become a Christian. But there's
[57:27] a joy that we possess that comes into
[57:30] our being that is absolutely divorced
[57:34] from condition. I mean this is the thing
[57:36] we to realize that it's maybe I'll just
[57:39] read it. I think I'm Yeah, we'll just
[57:40] Where is it? Here.
[57:43] He says this
[57:45] if I can find it.
[57:49] Let's come to this quote.
[57:53] I'll get there. Let's just let some
[57:55] suspense build. I'm going to find
[58:03] it is here. It's like the main part of
[58:04] my service. What's going on?
[58:16] Okay.
[58:17] It's very odd.
[58:19] Anyway, in the unveiling of God,
[58:24] it here.
[58:36] Here it is. Here the 12.
[58:38] Okay,
[58:45] here it is. Good.
[58:47] Brother Bram says this in the in in the
[58:49] mighty God unveiled before us. Hope you
[58:51] didn't mind the pause. Okay. He says,
[58:53] "Here he is, the mighty conqueror since
[58:55] he rent the veil in two." See, he come
[58:58] the mercy seat hanging in the clear view
[58:59] of the congregation. But them being
[59:01] under the popular opinion now men and
[59:03] women and delegates of this convention,
[59:05] I want to say this without respective
[59:07] person. But in the view of today, in the
[59:09] view of what we're here for today, I'm
[59:11] afraid that the traditions of the
[59:13] fathers, the church fathers has hid this
[59:15] from too many people. Since the Holy
[59:17] Ghost has come in this last days, is
[59:19] prophesied and the veil has been rent.
[59:21] Too many people try to hang on to their
[59:24] traditions of the fathers. That's why
[59:26] they can't see the extreme joy and peace
[59:29] and things that the church has today.
[59:31] Yet, it's in plain view of those who
[59:33] believe. He hid the word, the promised
[59:35] word of this day. Now the traditions has
[59:37] made a veil. They say that the days of
[59:39] miracles is passed. So they're saying
[59:41] that what they had back there they don't
[59:43] have today. But he's saying that look
[59:45] the veil's been rent and too many people
[59:47] try to hang on to the veil. They think
[59:50] it's actually a good thing to hang on to
[59:51] the thing that obscured God from them
[59:54] because they think that is the way the
[59:55] right way to approach God. No, that's a
[59:58] traditional veil that needs to go away.
[1:00:01] Amen. I'll just be reverent and quiet
[1:00:03] and, you know, be a be a church mouse
[1:00:05] and be down and just always, you know,
[1:00:07] you know, always just think, well, one
[1:00:08] day God will deliver me all these
[1:00:10] things. That's a tradition. That's a
[1:00:12] veil of tradition. We're not meant to
[1:00:14] walk around like beggars. God did not
[1:00:16] want us as beggars. He wants us as sons
[1:00:18] and daughters of God. Amen. So, so this
[1:00:21] veil has been rent and people, that's
[1:00:23] why they can't see this extreme joy and
[1:00:25] peace and the things the church has
[1:00:27] today. Yet, it's in plain view of them
[1:00:29] that believe. Why? Why is it in plain
[1:00:30] view? Because he is now in plain view. I
[1:00:33] mean the word himself, Christ himself is
[1:00:35] in plain view. And it generates an
[1:00:37] extreme joy and peace. I mean in the
[1:00:40] believer why? Because he's pulled you
[1:00:42] within the veil. Amen. That veil of
[1:00:44] tradition that you should be should be
[1:00:46] sad and mopy and down. All those things
[1:00:48] that veil is gone. Friends, we have
[1:00:50] extreme joy today. Amen. We have joy
[1:00:52] like a fountain. Amen. Peace like a
[1:00:55] river, love like the ocean. Amen. An
[1:00:57] unexhaustible fountain of joy. Amen. And
[1:00:59] that joy is not based on condition. That
[1:01:02] peace of God is not based on condition.
[1:01:04] It's not some nana state to be in where
[1:01:06] your where your life is is is absent of
[1:01:08] trouble. No, it's in trouble. You have
[1:01:11] that peace. Amen. It's in trouble you
[1:01:13] have that joy. What is that joy? I'm
[1:01:16] within the holiest of holies. I've
[1:01:18] become one with the Lord God Almighty.
[1:01:20] He has saved me. He's redeemed me. He's
[1:01:22] cleansed me of all sin. Amen. And that
[1:01:24] gives a joy in my soul or joy in my
[1:01:27] spirit rather. Amen. that that that I
[1:01:29] just can't contain. Why? Because he has
[1:01:32] cleansed me. I'm on my way to heaven.
[1:01:33] Shouting victory. Amen. That's an
[1:01:36] extreme joy. It's not just a little bit
[1:01:38] of joy. It's extreme. Amen. The thing is
[1:01:40] that a tradition a traditional veil
[1:01:42] wants to come on people and say, "Don't
[1:01:43] be too happy. But you'll get out of
[1:01:46] order. We're conservative. We're
[1:01:48] reserved." No, the word reserved. You
[1:01:50] know, you look at a table that's
[1:01:51] reserved for somebody else. Who are you
[1:01:53] reserved for?
[1:01:56] I'm reserved for God. and he's occupying
[1:01:59] this seat.
[1:02:01] Amen. You say, "Well, I don't I'm just
[1:02:03] not built that way." I tell you what, if
[1:02:05] we got you all drunk, you wouldn't be
[1:02:06] all quiet. I tell you what, if it wasn't
[1:02:09] if it wasn't a sin to get drunk, and I
[1:02:10] had a whole bunch of wine here. Some of
[1:02:12] you who don't talk will be dancing on
[1:02:14] these pews. I mean, you'll be you'll be
[1:02:16] dancing around feeling so happy if you
[1:02:18] are like naturally drunk. Trust me, I've
[1:02:21] been there. Thank God I'm not there
[1:02:23] anymore. God set me free of it. But it's
[1:02:25] just a cheap copy of being drunk in the
[1:02:27] spirit. I tell you what, friends, when
[1:02:29] was the last time you were drunk in the
[1:02:31] presence of the Lord? When was the last
[1:02:33] time you're intoxicated by the
[1:02:35] revelation of the word? Amen. Where just
[1:02:37] got too much. Amen. But you wanted more
[1:02:39] anyway. Amen. Where the joy of the Lord
[1:02:40] just overflowed. Amen. We just couldn't
[1:02:43] contain it. When was the last time that
[1:02:45] happened? Cuz that's your portion. But a
[1:02:47] traditional veil wants to shut you off
[1:02:49] from your joy source. No. I say that
[1:02:51] veil's been rent. We have a right to be
[1:02:53] happy. We have a right to praise God. We
[1:02:56] have a right to dance. We have a right
[1:02:58] to let off the pressure. You say, "Well,
[1:03:00] we shouldn't let off the pressure and
[1:03:01] cry and all these things." No, we are
[1:03:03] called God's prophet told us, "Come into
[1:03:07] church, let off the pressure. Come into
[1:03:10] the presence of God and let off the
[1:03:12] pressure." Well, that's just a bunch of
[1:03:13] steam coming out the whistle and the
[1:03:15] engine's not moving. I'd rather have
[1:03:17] steam coming out than a cold boiler on
[1:03:20] the inside with no fire. I mean, because
[1:03:23] steam is evidence there's fire in an
[1:03:25] engine, steam engine, right? So, I'd
[1:03:26] rather have steam coming out my whistle
[1:03:29] and I'm on the tracks than just cold
[1:03:31] there not moving. Cuz the thing is,
[1:03:33] right, we got to realize we have the
[1:03:35] fire, but we have the mechanics to go
[1:03:37] forward. Amen. We have both together.
[1:03:41] Hallelujah. So, in light of all these
[1:03:43] things, now forgive me if this is all
[1:03:45] kind of chopped up. I just want to go on
[1:03:47] the positive side. It's easy to talk
[1:03:49] about tradition and this is wrong and we
[1:03:51] shouldn't be this way. No, we are
[1:03:52] ordained to be free in the spirit. I
[1:03:54] mean, we're ordained to to to to be able
[1:03:57] to express to God how we truly feel. You
[1:04:01] say, "Well, there's joy in my soul. I
[1:04:03] don't feel it, but I've got it." I
[1:04:05] actually say, "No, there's no joy in
[1:04:06] your soul. Your soul doesn't have
[1:04:08] feelings. There's faith or doubt
[1:04:10] controlling your soul. Amen. But the
[1:04:12] nature of your spirit is actually the
[1:04:14] nature of your soul. Amen. So because
[1:04:16] once upon a time before God met you,
[1:04:19] there was unbelief ruling your soul. So
[1:04:21] what that that unbelief came into your
[1:04:23] spirit and you did all kinds of things
[1:04:25] to the world that that that unbelief or
[1:04:27] sin was governing you to do. I know for
[1:04:29] myself that's what I did. I drank, I
[1:04:31] partied, I played games, I listened to
[1:04:33] all kind of music, all that kind of
[1:04:35] stuff. Everything in the world I did. I
[1:04:36] didn't smoke cuz I couldn't afford it.
[1:04:38] But you see you know that but that was
[1:04:40] sin nature ruling me. So the nature of
[1:04:44] my what I was in my spirit realm was
[1:04:46] because of what was in my soul unbelief.
[1:04:48] But one day God rich in mercy came my
[1:04:51] way. Amen. And I went from unbelief to
[1:04:54] faith. So faith now came into my soul
[1:04:56] and that faith began to rule into my
[1:04:58] spirit. Amen. So the nature that's in my
[1:05:01] spirit is because of what's already in
[1:05:02] my soul. Amen. So what's in my spirit
[1:05:04] now? Joy like a fountain, peace like a
[1:05:07] river, a contentment. Oh, I'm so
[1:05:10] content. Why? What are you content
[1:05:12] about? That I'm saved. I'm sealed to the
[1:05:14] day of my redemption. Amen. I have a
[1:05:16] blessed assurance that Jesus is mine. I
[1:05:19] want a foretaste of glory divine. Amen.
[1:05:21] You know, we sing that song about
[1:05:23] standing before the holy consuming fire.
[1:05:25] Sure, that gives us sincerity, but it
[1:05:27] gives a joy. Amen. Because you got to
[1:05:29] think about it. If you're accepted here,
[1:05:31] you'll be accepted there. Amen. And
[1:05:34] you're accepted here. Why? Because you
[1:05:35] received the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:05:37] because you're ordained before the
[1:05:39] foundation of the world to do so. You're
[1:05:41] accepted here. The Holy Ghost sealed you
[1:05:42] to the day of your redemption. You've
[1:05:44] been accepted. The scripture says we're
[1:05:46] accepted in the beloved. Amen. So, if
[1:05:50] I'm accepted here, I ain't being turned
[1:05:53] out there. But I tell you what, if I
[1:05:55] feel the way I feel right now and I
[1:05:57] stand before his presence and he sends
[1:05:58] me to hell, I'll love him in hell.
[1:06:02] I'll worship him there. You know,
[1:06:04] earlier in my Christian walk, I the
[1:06:06] devil twisted in my mind about, you
[1:06:08] know, there's that scripture, if you sin
[1:06:10] willfully after you come to the
[1:06:11] knowledge of the truth, there's no more
[1:06:13] sacrifice for sin, right? So, he twisted
[1:06:16] that in my mind, basically saying that,
[1:06:17] well, it's like a child. If you tell
[1:06:19] them not to do something and and they do
[1:06:21] it, then there's then there's just
[1:06:23] judgment. And and so, he twisted that
[1:06:26] scripture in my mind and my heart like
[1:06:28] sunk like a lead balloon. I felt well I
[1:06:31] actually felt lost like completely lost
[1:06:33] after the Lord had gloriously saved me
[1:06:34] and changed me and everything but then I
[1:06:36] came to a point I said Lord
[1:06:39] I ain't turning back I'm not going back
[1:06:41] into the world that that bridge has been
[1:06:44] burnt Lord I'm going to live for you I'm
[1:06:46] going to love you I'm going to serve you
[1:06:48] and even if you cast me away at least I
[1:06:50] get an opportunity to stand before you
[1:06:52] one day and tell you face to face that I
[1:06:54] love you and you can send me to hell
[1:06:56] then that's fine at least I get that
[1:06:58] opportunity Lord Stop. Amen. Why?
[1:07:01] Because no, honestly, if if if I'm this
[1:07:04] way,
[1:07:06] I'll love him in hell if he sends me
[1:07:08] there. I've got a joy unspeakable. I
[1:07:11] know in whom I have believed. See,
[1:07:13] there's such a tradition that you know,
[1:07:15] you know that's come into the message.
[1:07:16] People say, "Do they follow the
[1:07:18] message?" Or, "Have you received the
[1:07:20] message?" It becomes a tradition of just
[1:07:22] a phrase that's come in. That's not the
[1:07:24] right question to ask. The right
[1:07:25] question is, "Have you received the Holy
[1:07:27] Ghost since you believed? That's a
[1:07:29] scriptural question to ask a believer.
[1:07:31] Well, have you met him? Has he changed
[1:07:33] your life? Has he put a faith in your
[1:07:35] soul that's changed you? Amen. Have you
[1:07:37] Can you look back and he's taken me from
[1:07:39] glory to glory? More than just adopting
[1:07:41] a creed of a well, yes, I have received
[1:07:43] the message. That's a good question to
[1:07:45] ask, but it's not the right question to
[1:07:46] ask. Amen. Because brother Bram has even
[1:07:49] even um says in the token message. Now,
[1:07:52] if I can find this,
[1:07:54] he says he says this. He says, "Don't
[1:07:56] just come this far and say I believe the
[1:07:58] message. You obey the messenger, come
[1:07:59] into Christ. You say, "Well, I believe
[1:08:01] every word said, Brother Bam, and people
[1:08:04] say, "Yes, I believe every word.
[1:08:05] Therefore, I've got the token." That's a
[1:08:07] traditional veil. Cuz he says, "That's
[1:08:10] good, but that's just being able to
[1:08:11] read."
[1:08:13] Got to go beyond that. Go beyond a
[1:08:15] mental assessment of yes, I'm in the
[1:08:16] message cuz I believe it. No, it's got
[1:08:18] to be quickened. I mean, you got to go
[1:08:20] within that veil of tradition because
[1:08:22] what has always been as people say,
[1:08:24] well, I need to learn about God,
[1:08:26] therefore I know him. That's a
[1:08:27] traditional veil. Amen. That came in
[1:08:30] when the gospel came among the Greeks
[1:08:31] because they thought that learning about
[1:08:33] something was the same as revelation.
[1:08:35] But that's not the same thing as
[1:08:37] revelation. That's knowledge. Amen. But
[1:08:38] when God reveals himself, that's
[1:08:40] revelation. When when the word becomes
[1:08:42] part of you, when it's quickened that
[1:08:44] you can't deny it, you can't forget it.
[1:08:46] You can't throw it away. But it becomes
[1:08:48] so real and it changes your life. That's
[1:08:50] revelation. Amen. But just learning
[1:08:52] something, well, you can swap your
[1:08:53] knowledge. You know because remember
[1:08:55] coming to Christianity is not not you
[1:08:57] adopting a thought. It's not changing
[1:09:00] like brother B was standing in India and
[1:09:02] he was talking about all the um you know
[1:09:03] you you talking to all the religions
[1:09:05] there and I think the Jane or seek
[1:09:06] temple whatever it was he says look you
[1:09:08] just want to make everyone the same
[1:09:10] changing thinking everyone Muslims to
[1:09:12] become Muslim or or Buddhist to become
[1:09:14] Buddhist or Jane to become Jane or seek
[1:09:15] to become seek or whatever more you know
[1:09:17] but he says we have the same thing in
[1:09:18] America all the Baptists want to make
[1:09:20] everyone Baptist or the Pentecostals
[1:09:22] Pentecostal or Lutheran Lutheran he says
[1:09:24] that's just a changing of thought he
[1:09:26] says it's never meant to be that way no
[1:09:28] it's me to God's meant to come down by
[1:09:30] faith into the soul of man and live
[1:09:32] there and change their whole being,
[1:09:34] not just how we think. You see, so it's
[1:09:37] a traditional veil of, "Well, if I've
[1:09:38] learned enough, therefore, I know him."
[1:09:40] That's a veil. God's rent that veil. He
[1:09:43] wants to know you by experience. He
[1:09:45] wants to know you by power. He wants to
[1:09:47] know you in reality. That's what he
[1:09:49] wants. Amen. So, we got to go beyond
[1:09:51] that. Praise the Lord. I'm glad that
[1:09:54] veil's been read. Otherwise, you know,
[1:09:56] oh, you got to get an A+ in the message,
[1:09:58] therefore you're going to heaven. I
[1:09:59] would never get there.
[1:10:03] True.
[1:10:05] Amen.
[1:10:06] I'm just trying to find where I should
[1:10:09] be.
[1:10:11] You see, it's it becomes a tradition.
[1:10:16] Amen. Like it's like the day of
[1:10:17] Pentecost.
[1:10:19] The everyone on the outside of the upper
[1:10:21] room was Pentecostal. They had come to
[1:10:23] celebrate the feast of Pentecost. It had
[1:10:25] become a tradition. But God had come in
[1:10:28] that time to fulfill his word. And those
[1:10:31] in the upper room, they weren't
[1:10:32] following tradition. They were there to
[1:10:35] receive the promise of the father, the
[1:10:36] holy ghost that Jesus told them to stay
[1:10:38] there until they received it. They had
[1:10:40] come to receive the promised word in
[1:10:44] their lives. Amen. So it's always a veil
[1:10:46] of well, we follow this by tradition.
[1:10:49] Even brother Brand makes a statement
[1:10:50] that you know God will move in someone's
[1:10:52] life and they garnish his tomb. They
[1:10:54] make it big and they make a tradition
[1:10:56] out of that his life. And how many
[1:10:59] people have made a tradition out of
[1:11:00] brother Ara's life? It's good to know
[1:11:02] about his life. It's good to know where
[1:11:03] he went and the things he did. But if
[1:11:05] you just make that some kind of criteria
[1:11:07] of being a believer, that's just a
[1:11:09] tradition.
[1:11:10] What did he want you to know? The God he
[1:11:12] knew. That's what he wanted. Remember
[1:11:16] the end of the church age book, the last
[1:11:17] paragraph, he says, he says, "The one
[1:11:19] thing I've desired is that man and man
[1:11:22] will enter into a true spiritual
[1:11:24] relationship with God and live according
[1:11:26] to his word." That was the whole thrust
[1:11:28] of the message that man and God would
[1:11:30] have a true spiritual relationship
[1:11:32] together. Amen. But a veil tries to come
[1:11:35] down of tradition saying you can't know
[1:11:37] his God.
[1:11:39] That's a veil. You say, "Well, I'm just
[1:11:42] me. He's saved by the same blood you're
[1:11:44] saved by. The same atonement made for
[1:11:46] him is the same atonement made for you.
[1:11:48] The same blood shed for the apostles is
[1:11:50] the same blood shed for you. There's no
[1:11:52] difference.
[1:11:55] Amen. Are we all together here? You
[1:11:56] know, it's a veil to think, well, God
[1:11:59] can't live my life the same way he lived
[1:12:00] in theirs. Yeah, he can.
[1:12:03] You can have joy unspeakable, full of
[1:12:05] glory, irrespective of condition.
[1:12:09] Amen. So you see it became it was a
[1:12:11] tradition for those there on the day of
[1:12:13] Pentecost that weren't in the upper room
[1:12:15] but those that came to the upper room
[1:12:17] they're looking for the promised word to
[1:12:18] be fulfilled in their lives. And to me
[1:12:21] that's like why do we come to church?
[1:12:24] Well I do because I do. That's
[1:12:27] tradition. If it's not with sincerity
[1:12:29] it's it becomes a tradition. And we
[1:12:32] can't pass down a faith that's without
[1:12:33] sincerity. It's got to be got to be
[1:12:36] deeply sincere in this day. God you
[1:12:38] called me. God. Let's just take that
[1:12:41] statement. I want to break it. God,
[1:12:42] who's it? All the almighty. The one who
[1:12:44] made heavens and earth. The one who made
[1:12:46] your body. The one who made the earth
[1:12:47] you live in and and the materials that
[1:12:49] put your house together and the clothes
[1:12:50] that you wear. He called me. Amen. How
[1:12:54] can that not make you sincere? How can
[1:12:56] it not make you thankful? It wasn't a a
[1:12:59] church never called anyone here. I've
[1:13:02] never asked anyone to join a church. We
[1:13:04] have no membership. We got no papers.
[1:13:06] This is not what this is about. No. What
[1:13:08] it's about is God calls people to walk
[1:13:11] with him. Not just know about him, but
[1:13:13] to know him that he would dwell on the
[1:13:15] inside of the inside of him. Uh them
[1:13:17] rather. Amen. So you think, well, God
[1:13:19] called me. That changes everything. What
[1:13:21] has he called me to do? Walk with him to
[1:13:24] know him. Amen. But a traditional veil
[1:13:26] is yes, Jesus calls, but it's kind of a
[1:13:29] very distant kind of a historical call.
[1:13:32] That veil's been rent. The same God back
[1:13:34] there that said to the disciples, "Come
[1:13:36] follow me," is the same God that says
[1:13:38] the same thing to you.
[1:13:41] Amen. That it does not become a
[1:13:43] tradition. So even coming to church, why
[1:13:45] do we come? Well, this is what I do.
[1:13:48] It's got to be beyond that. You know, I
[1:13:50] was thinking about this last night. I
[1:13:52] come to church to see what God's going
[1:13:54] to do.
[1:13:57] That's why I come. Oh, I want to hear
[1:13:59] the word. I want to hear a good sermon
[1:14:00] or I want to hear a new thought. That
[1:14:02] can just become a tradition. I want to
[1:14:04] hear things given slightly different
[1:14:06] way. That can just become a tradition.
[1:14:08] No, I come here that the word goes forth
[1:14:10] or rather an atmosphere is created that
[1:14:13] God comes into that atmosphere. Amen.
[1:14:15] That faith can be released into every
[1:14:17] heart that every divine promise that we
[1:14:20] have need of is manifested in our lives.
[1:14:22] That we don't just talk about joy and
[1:14:24] peace and not possess it, but we have
[1:14:25] it. We don't just claim it, but it's
[1:14:27] ours. Amen. We need healing, we receive
[1:14:29] it. And we don't let the devil ever drag
[1:14:31] down our faith thinking, "Well, you
[1:14:33] haven't received it yet." You say,
[1:14:34] "Praise God, it's on its way. Praise
[1:14:36] God, your promises are true." And then
[1:14:38] God comes down and does what he wants to
[1:14:40] do. And the miraculous takes place. And
[1:14:42] we go out of these doors saying, "Wow."
[1:14:46] Isn't that why we come to church? That's
[1:14:49] why I come to church. I don't come to
[1:14:51] speak. I come to worship God. You say,
[1:14:54] "Well, you're just you're just uh
[1:14:56] pursuing miracles. He is the God of the
[1:14:59] miraculous.
[1:15:01] The gospel came not in word only but in
[1:15:04] power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:15:06] Ghost. That's how the gospel came. And
[1:15:07] if we're preaching the same gospel that
[1:15:09] Paul preached that we do, Amen. then
[1:15:11] there should be power and demonstration.
[1:15:13] Where God can come down. We come in
[1:15:14] these doors with a bad attitude. We
[1:15:16] don't leave with that bad attitude. We
[1:15:18] come down feeling down. We don't leave
[1:15:19] feeling down. What's happened? Actually,
[1:15:21] a spirit's been cast off of you, making
[1:15:23] you feel down and gloomy and moody. No,
[1:15:25] you walk out rejoicing. It doesn't
[1:15:27] matter what you have to face. Why? Cuz
[1:15:28] the word has lifted you up. Amen. Where
[1:15:31] you should be, where you're ordained to
[1:15:33] live. Hallelujah. It's like, you know,
[1:15:35] we live up on the hill. Open our
[1:15:37] curtains, you see all this fog down in
[1:15:40] the valley. From our perspective, it
[1:15:42] looks beautiful.
[1:15:44] You drive down here like this morning,
[1:15:45] it's all gloomy and dark and all these
[1:15:47] things. I thought, man, same fog, same
[1:15:49] place, but it's the perspective that
[1:15:52] really matters. Amen. because I drove
[1:15:53] back up the hill. I look back down and
[1:15:55] it's beautiful and shiny and bright and
[1:15:57] it looks neat, but it's but it's your
[1:15:59] position and it's your attitude
[1:16:02] dictates your altitude.
[1:16:05] Amen. So, if your attitude is down,
[1:16:07] well, you're you're you're going to hit
[1:16:08] the dirt. You're basically submarining.
[1:16:11] But if your attitude is, Lord, you're
[1:16:12] more than able. Lord, you're awesome.
[1:16:14] Lord, you're my portion. Lord, you did
[1:16:16] not save me to lose me, but you're
[1:16:18] keeping me and this is working for my
[1:16:19] good, Lord. And this trials bring me
[1:16:21] closer to you, Lord, because you harness
[1:16:23] trouble. You put bits in its mouth and
[1:16:25] cause it to bring me closer to you,
[1:16:26] Lord. And I can't lose. And you're so
[1:16:28] wonderful, Lord. And I'm ordained to
[1:16:30] eternal life, oh God. And you save me.
[1:16:32] Amen. I tell you what, you just
[1:16:34] basically you're f so far past past
[1:16:37] Pluto now. You Why? Cuz your altitude is
[1:16:40] real high.
[1:16:42] But if you're like, "Poor me and why
[1:16:44] this and wo is me and this trouble and
[1:16:46] well, I deserve this." That's a
[1:16:47] traditional veil.
[1:16:50] Oh, but I need to I want to be happy in
[1:16:52] life. Joy is not based on circumstance.
[1:16:57] That's a very temperamental joy. That's
[1:16:59] a joy that comes and goes like the
[1:17:02] sunshine here, right? It's not permanent
[1:17:06] joy. But the joy we possess is stable.
[1:17:10] It's constant. It's always there. It's
[1:17:14] like being by a warm fire that never
[1:17:15] goes out. It's always there. And it
[1:17:18] doesn't matter where you move that fire,
[1:17:20] it burns.
[1:17:22] Hallelujah. But what happens is when you
[1:17:24] go in the veil, when those traditional
[1:17:25] veils are rent or they are rent, but you
[1:17:27] step through them instead of trying to
[1:17:29] sew them back over because it's more
[1:17:30] holy to feel down and well, I'm going
[1:17:32] through a trial. I want to ask you the
[1:17:34] question, what is the main focus of our
[1:17:36] conversation?
[1:17:38] What is our main focus? Because whatever
[1:17:40] you talk about the most is really what
[1:17:42] you embody. We all have troubles. We
[1:17:45] have troubles. We have unanswered
[1:17:46] questions and prayers that seem to
[1:17:47] linger. We all have those things. But is
[1:17:50] that what we focus on?
[1:17:53] That's right. I wouldn't focus on those
[1:17:55] things. I'm not saying ignore them. We
[1:17:58] don't have ostrich ostrich faith that we
[1:18:00] bury our head in the sand, pretend
[1:18:01] there's no problems. We know they're
[1:18:03] there. But what's our main conversation?
[1:18:06] I mean, because brother Ram said in the
[1:18:07] Christ of mystery, God revealed, he
[1:18:09] says, now he is the principal theme of
[1:18:11] the Bible. And if the Bible, the words
[1:18:14] in you, he should be the principal theme
[1:18:15] of our walking, talking, actions,
[1:18:17] everything we do. Amen. So now if he's
[1:18:19] the principal theme, and what is he?
[1:18:21] Redemption, salvation, healing,
[1:18:25] restoration, guidance, comfort, joy,
[1:18:30] peace, counsel, establishment, a shield,
[1:18:34] a fortress, a protection, a shepherd.
[1:18:36] He's our all in all as our father. Amen.
[1:18:39] He cares for us. If if that's him, then
[1:18:42] should not that be our principal theme
[1:18:43] of our conversation? Irrespective of
[1:18:46] what's going on,
[1:18:49] you say, "Well, can you live like that?"
[1:18:51] The Apostle Paul sure did. He sure did.
[1:18:55] His joy before that veil was rent before
[1:18:57] him was how good his scholarship was.
[1:19:00] That was be but it was just prestige
[1:19:01] among men. How good he was. And that was
[1:19:03] his joy. Look, I'm the Pharisee of the
[1:19:05] Pharisees. Look at me. And I, you know,
[1:19:07] I just walk just just just right. and
[1:19:09] you know I'm a believer you know but
[1:19:13] then he met the Lord on the road to
[1:19:14] Damascus and he saw that the veil was
[1:19:17] rent and he walked through that veil to
[1:19:20] that place of extreme joy and peace and
[1:19:22] all the church that possessed and he
[1:19:24] kept that joy all the way to the end of
[1:19:26] his life.
[1:19:29] Amen. Let's just find that shall we have
[1:19:31] it somewhere.
[1:19:33] He says this here in uh the book of
[1:19:35] Acts. Here it is here. He says,
[1:19:37] "Testifying both to the Jews and also to
[1:19:39] the Greeks, repentance towards God and
[1:19:41] faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:19:43] now, behold, I go bound in the spirit
[1:19:45] unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things
[1:19:46] that shall befall me there, say that the
[1:19:48] Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city,
[1:19:51] saying that bonds and afflictions abide
[1:19:53] me. But none of these things move me,
[1:19:55] neither count I my life dear unto
[1:19:57] myself, so that I might finish my course
[1:20:00] with joy."
[1:20:03] Amen. So he knew, he didn't know the
[1:20:06] exact detail, but the Holy Ghost
[1:20:08] everywhere he went said, "Bonds and
[1:20:09] afflictions are abiding him. This is
[1:20:11] what you're going to walk into, Paul.
[1:20:13] You're going to walk into the trial of
[1:20:14] your life." He says, "I know." He's
[1:20:17] going to finish his course with joy. God
[1:20:20] would take him as an example to show
[1:20:22] that nothing could stop the revelation
[1:20:25] of God coming into his life. No
[1:20:26] condition. Amen. whether he was chased
[1:20:29] from city to city. You know, some people
[1:20:32] just give us a bad comment on Facebook
[1:20:33] and we cry
[1:20:37] or whatever social media account. People
[1:20:39] say something mean about us and we get
[1:20:41] all poor me and this is sad and whatever
[1:20:43] more. He got stoned. He got chased from
[1:20:45] city to city. He ended up in prison. I'm
[1:20:48] not diminishing anything, but you got to
[1:20:49] realize Paul was rugged. Why? Because
[1:20:51] the joy of the Lord was his strength. I
[1:20:54] mean he was built like all of us had the
[1:20:56] same emotions and all those things but
[1:20:58] the joy of the Lord was his strength. He
[1:21:01] went within the veil and that extreme
[1:21:02] joy and peace that the church possessed
[1:21:04] he possessed it. Amen. So it didn't
[1:21:06] matter where he was going. Sure he had
[1:21:08] afflictions. He was distressed. He was
[1:21:10] had troubles. All these things but what
[1:21:12] governed his life?
[1:21:14] Lord Jesus.
[1:21:16] Hallelujah.
[1:21:19] He says that I might finish my course
[1:21:21] with joy.
[1:21:23] He had joy unspeakable and full of
[1:21:25] glory. He was in a storm 14 days. Did he
[1:21:28] get sad? No. He went to a source of
[1:21:31] strength. Because there's always a veil
[1:21:33] of condition that tries to come over us.
[1:21:36] The veil of the five senses. Look at the
[1:21:39] state you're in. Look at your bank
[1:21:41] account. Look at this. Look at all these
[1:21:42] things that are going on. I'm not
[1:21:44] diminishing those things. The Apostle
[1:21:45] Paul was in a storm 14 days. It's like a
[1:21:48] bottle stopper going up and down on on
[1:21:50] the sea. That boat was. But what did he
[1:21:52] do? He didn't let the the um
[1:21:55] circumstances veil over the fact that
[1:21:57] God was with him. Amen. Because God had
[1:21:59] already told him before he got on the
[1:22:01] boat, you're going to witness to Caesar.
[1:22:04] You're going to Rome, Paul. This is the
[1:22:06] word of the Lord that had come to him.
[1:22:08] So, he realized because the veil was
[1:22:09] open, he realized nothing the devil
[1:22:11] could put in front of him could stop
[1:22:12] that word coming to pass. And friends,
[1:22:15] we're not going to Italy. We're going to
[1:22:17] glory. Amen. God has ordained that we're
[1:22:20] going in a rapture. Amen. You shall step
[1:22:22] on streets of gold. Amen. You shall
[1:22:25] crown me king of kings and lord of
[1:22:27] lords. You shall be presented before me
[1:22:29] holy without blame and love.
[1:22:32] Amen. So now if God has given that word
[1:22:35] to you and I trust if the veils come
[1:22:37] open, you realize it's not your ability
[1:22:39] that gets you there. It's not your good
[1:22:41] works or your, you know, what you can
[1:22:43] earn. Those are all traditional veils.
[1:22:44] Those things have been rent. And God's
[1:22:46] pulled you within the Holy of Holies for
[1:22:47] you to realize, no, God has ordained
[1:22:49] that I'm going to end up there.
[1:22:52] And what happened? Paul got to Rome.
[1:22:55] Shipwreck, snake bit, whatever more
[1:22:58] happened, he got there.
[1:23:02] This joy is not based on circumstance.
[1:23:05] If that joy was based on circumstance,
[1:23:08] he would not have finished his course
[1:23:10] with joy. We're going to cut your head
[1:23:12] off in the morning. The Apostle Paul,
[1:23:14] what do you think he did? He went there
[1:23:15] with joy. That's not that doesn't make
[1:23:18] sense. You got to realize that death is
[1:23:20] a travel bus to get us where we want to
[1:23:21] go. That's what brother Ron Spencer said
[1:23:24] a few years ago.
[1:23:26] Amen.
[1:23:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:31] You know the Lord Jesus had joy. Who
[1:23:34] wants to be like Jesus? Yes, sir.
[1:23:38] Says here in Luke 10:21, in that hour
[1:23:41] Jesus rejoiced in the spirit, saying, I
[1:23:44] thank thee, oh father, Lord of heaven
[1:23:45] and earth, that thou has hid these
[1:23:46] things from the eyes of the wise and
[1:23:48] prudent and has revealed them unto
[1:23:49] babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed
[1:23:52] good in thy sight. You know that word
[1:23:54] rejoice? You know what it means? Many
[1:23:56] times we see this and we see Jesus do
[1:23:58] this or this or some kind of hippie
[1:24:00] Jesus who's who's all chill. Yeah. Who's
[1:24:03] seen that? He's all this pious kind of a
[1:24:05] fellow. That word rejoice means to jump
[1:24:07] for joy. He jumped for joy. Amen. He's
[1:24:11] exceedingly rejoicing. He wasn't just,
[1:24:13] "Yeah, praise God. That's wonderful."
[1:24:15] No, he was jumping for joy exceedingly.
[1:24:17] Amen. Why? Because these things have
[1:24:20] been revealed to babes. Amen. The
[1:24:22] revelation that he contained was now
[1:24:23] being spread to others. Amen. That's
[1:24:26] what he says, "Blessed are the eyes
[1:24:27] which see the things that ye see." Amen.
[1:24:30] This is the joy that he rejoiced in that
[1:24:32] the word went to others that God
[1:24:34] revealed it to other people. And should
[1:24:36] that not be the same joy that we should
[1:24:38] possess? Should we not be able to
[1:24:40] rejoice in the spirit when someone when
[1:24:42] when the light goes on, when the candle
[1:24:44] gets lit, you know, there's finally a,
[1:24:46] you know,
[1:24:47] someone is actually dwelling in the
[1:24:49] house now.
[1:24:51] Amen.
[1:24:53] Praise the Lord. Now, forgive me. This
[1:24:55] is all kind of
[1:25:04] I'm just going to read these couple of
[1:25:05] quotes then we'll close.
[1:25:07] He says here now you can't walk outside
[1:25:09] this veil. You've got to come in here to
[1:25:11] find out. You've got to get there where
[1:25:13] there's nothing between you and God
[1:25:15] where the angels of God can descend and
[1:25:17] ascend back and forth bringing the
[1:25:19] messages of God back and forth to the
[1:25:20] individual. There's nothing between my
[1:25:22] soul and the savior. The poet said there
[1:25:24] he sits the mighty conqueror. He rent
[1:25:26] every veil in two. He rent the veil that
[1:25:28] you could be saved. He rent the veil
[1:25:30] that if you've committed adultery, if
[1:25:32] you have cursed, if you've done anything
[1:25:33] wrong, he rent that veil for you. That
[1:25:36] stick that Satan holds over you, he rent
[1:25:38] it. You'll only receive him. I mean, if
[1:25:41] you'll only receive him. If you're sick
[1:25:43] today, the doctors say you can't get
[1:25:44] well, he rent that veil in two. And
[1:25:46] everything is broken before God. He rent
[1:25:48] every veil. He tears down every domain.
[1:25:51] And he sits there today, the mighty
[1:25:52] conqueror since he rent the veil in two.
[1:25:55] Amen. That stick the devil holds over
[1:25:57] you, he rent that in two. What's that
[1:25:59] stick? Oh, you've done too wrong and you
[1:26:01] know, I'm here to deal with you and
[1:26:02] you're cursed and you're not blessed
[1:26:04] anymore. I tell you what, what God has
[1:26:06] blessed remains blessed. Amen. What God
[1:26:08] has blessed remains blessed. Amen. You
[1:26:10] got to realize this that if God is if
[1:26:12] you know, if you receive the Lord,
[1:26:14] you're blessed. Amen. Amen. You're
[1:26:16] blessed. And God cannot reverse his
[1:26:18] blessing. See, it's such a it's such a
[1:26:20] traditional veil of of my own ability.
[1:26:23] Amen. Dictates whether I'm blessed or
[1:26:25] not. No, Balam would say Balam would be
[1:26:28] anointed by God to prophesy about
[1:26:30] Israel. God is not a man that he should
[1:26:32] lie, neither the son of man that he
[1:26:33] should repent, which means change his
[1:26:35] mind. Hath he said and shall he not do
[1:26:37] it? Or had he spoken and shall not make
[1:26:39] it good? Behold, I have received
[1:26:40] commandment to bless and he hath blessed
[1:26:42] and I cannot reverse it. Amen. It's
[1:26:45] like, you know, Abraham was told, you
[1:26:47] shall be blessed and you shall be a
[1:26:48] blessing. So, you know, many people
[1:26:50] think, well, I've been cursed by God and
[1:26:52] this has happened and therefore I'm
[1:26:53] under this curse of sickness or whatever
[1:26:55] it is and I've just got to live under
[1:26:57] this curse. That's a lie. That's a lie
[1:26:59] of the devil. Amen. No. What who he has
[1:27:01] blessed is blessed and he cannot reverse
[1:27:04] that blessing. It's the devil that tries
[1:27:05] to curse people. Amen. But the church of
[1:27:07] the living God is here to take curses
[1:27:09] off people. And why? Because who God has
[1:27:11] blessed remains blessed. And God cannot
[1:27:14] change his mind. God cannot repent. He
[1:27:16] can't he can't back up and say, "Well, I
[1:27:18] guess I made a mistake by blessing that
[1:27:20] person with my presence, with my
[1:27:21] revelation." No. Who he has blessed
[1:27:24] remains blessed and that's it.
[1:27:28] He hath, you know, just before this,
[1:27:30] Balac, who's Barack, who's the king of
[1:27:33] um Balac is the who's the king of Moab,
[1:27:35] takes Balum around to see the hinder
[1:27:37] parts of Israel because because the king
[1:27:39] of Moab's under a traditional veil that
[1:27:42] if that that if Balam could just see the
[1:27:43] nasty bits, see the yucky bits of
[1:27:46] people's lives, then surely God will
[1:27:48] curse these people.
[1:27:51] But then when God when you know God
[1:27:53] speaks through Balum, you know, God says
[1:27:55] this. He says, "He hath not beheld
[1:27:57] iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
[1:28:00] perversess in Israel. The Lord his God
[1:28:02] is with him, and the shout of a king is
[1:28:05] among them." Hallelujah. So whom God is
[1:28:08] bless you, let's all say it. I'm blessed
[1:28:10] of the Lord. I'm blessed of the Lord.
[1:28:13] Amen. The Lord's blessings are upon me.
[1:28:16] Amen. He cannot curse me. He cannot take
[1:28:18] his blessings from me. I'm blessed.
[1:28:21] Hallelujah. That should be our
[1:28:22] confession. Oh, but what about this and
[1:28:24] this and this? No, I am blessed. All
[1:28:28] those things are temporal. Amen. All
[1:28:30] those things aren't forever, but the
[1:28:32] blessing of the Lord is eternal. Amen.
[1:28:34] Cuz he put his blessing upon me. His
[1:28:36] favor has come upon me, and he's taken
[1:28:38] me all the way into glory.
[1:28:40] Hallelujah. Let's just that way. Sorry,
[1:28:42] we're going to
[1:28:44] I just want to read. He says, well, you
[1:28:47] say, "Yes, Lord, I believe." Then you
[1:28:49] enter into life. The Holy Spirit comes
[1:28:50] into you. Your old spirit dies out,
[1:28:52] makes you lust and hate and malice and
[1:28:54] enmity and hatred and all them things
[1:28:55] dies away and you become full of love,
[1:28:58] joy, peace, and resting. No matter how
[1:29:00] the wind blows, it's all right.
[1:29:03] Hallelujah. Why? You've gone within the
[1:29:05] veil. Amen. You got extreme joy and
[1:29:08] peace in the things that the world
[1:29:10] possesses. Now,
[1:29:14] I'm just going to read two more. Promise
[1:29:15] if the musicians could come. So, I
[1:29:17] actually hold my promise this time. He
[1:29:19] says, "That's enough. We could think of
[1:29:21] that and it lets off the pressure. It
[1:29:22] takes the pressure away when we
[1:29:23] recognize the position we now hold in
[1:29:25] Christ by receiving the Holy Ghost,
[1:29:27] God's own life. The Greek word zo, which
[1:29:30] means God's own life dwelling in you.
[1:29:32] And you can no more die than God can
[1:29:34] die. We're eternal with the eternal.
[1:29:37] Amen. Waiting for that glorious time of
[1:29:39] redemption of the body.
[1:29:44] Every veil has been rent. This is my
[1:29:45] summary. Every veil's been rent.
[1:29:50] The veil of ability to earn something,
[1:29:52] it's been rent. The veil of thinking I
[1:29:55] better feel down and somber and all
[1:29:57] these things, that's been rent. The veil
[1:30:00] thinking I don't deserve his blessings,
[1:30:02] that's been rent. The veil of saying,
[1:30:04] well, I've got this troubles come into
[1:30:06] my life cuz I put a foot wrong and God's
[1:30:07] curses upon me, that's been rent because
[1:30:10] what God has blessed is blessed. Okay?
[1:30:13] That veil of, well, joy is based on
[1:30:15] circumstance, that's been rent.
[1:30:18] Amen.
[1:30:19] That peace is based on circumstance.
[1:30:21] That's been rent. All those veils are
[1:30:24] gone. You don't earn it. God gives it to
[1:30:27] you. Amen. You don't It's not by good
[1:30:30] behavior that you earn anything. God
[1:30:31] gives it to you. All those vows of
[1:30:34] tradition. Well, we got to be reverent
[1:30:35] and quiet and all these things. That
[1:30:37] veil's been rent. You be you in the
[1:30:38] presence of God. You want to shout,
[1:30:41] shout. You want to dance? Dance. Just
[1:30:42] let God do it. But don't let critical
[1:30:44] spirits hold you back. Right? You be
[1:30:47] God. You You just be in God who God made
[1:30:49] you to be. But make sure it's you being
[1:30:52] free in the spirit as opposed to you
[1:30:53] just being reserved because of a veil.
[1:30:57] You say, "Well, how can you be happy all
[1:30:59] the time?" Because of him. I'm happy.
[1:31:03] Because of him, I've got joy. Because of
[1:31:05] him, I've got peace. Not by
[1:31:07] circumstances, not by bank accounts, not
[1:31:09] by material things. Those things are
[1:31:11] going to be smoke bombs and craters one
[1:31:13] day anyway. That's not going to last.
[1:31:15] But what he has done in my soul will
[1:31:18] last for eternity. Amen. So I pray that
[1:31:22] we just let that veil of tradition hang
[1:31:25] to one side and let us step into the
[1:31:28] holy of holies and you'll see when he
[1:31:30] comes to the plane view in your life
[1:31:33] that that extreme joy and peace that the
[1:31:36] church possesses becomes a living
[1:31:38] reality in you.
[1:31:41] Amen. Let's um let's stand.
[1:31:45] Peace like a river. I've got peace like
[1:31:50] a river. I've got peace like a river in
[1:31:56] my soul.
[1:31:59] I've got peace like a river. I've got

[1:34:26] Savior in my soul. Peace like a river.

[1:34:58] Oh, amen. You got that peace like a
[1:35:01] river, joy like a fountain, love for
[1:35:03] your savior. Amen. Let's sing that song
[1:35:06] as joy unspeakable, full of glory. I
[1:35:07] think we sung it last Sunday. Yeah,
[1:35:09] let's sing that. Amen. You got joy
[1:35:10] unspeakable. You just can't put it to
[1:35:12] words. How great the joy. How
[1:35:15] satisfying. How wonderful. Amen. Full of
[1:35:18] glory.
[1:35:22] Amen.
[1:35:23] I
[1:35:25] found his grace. is all complete. He
[1:35:30] supped
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:36] and learn Jesus.
[1:35:40] I am free
[1:35:43] indeed.
[1:35:46] It is joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:35:52] full of glory as full of glorious joy
[1:35:58] unspeakable
[1:36:00] and full of glory and the heart has
[1:36:04] never yet been told.
[1:36:07] I have found the pleasure. I was great.
[1:36:13] His joy and peace with him.
[1:36:17] [Music]
[1:36:18] What a wonderous blessing. I am safe
[1:36:24] from the awful
[1:36:26] of sin.
[1:36:29] Yes, it is joy unspeakable
[1:36:32] and full of glory. Oh, full of glory.
[1:36:37] Yes. Full of glory is joy. Unspeakable
[1:36:43] and full of glory. And the heart has
[1:36:47] never yet been sold.
[1:36:51] I have found that hope so bright
[1:36:56] living in the realm of grace.
[1:37:02] Oh, the Savior's
[1:37:04] presence is so near. I can see his
[1:37:09] smiling face.
[1:37:13] It is joy unspeakable
[1:37:16] and
[1:37:17] glory. Yes, full of glory, full of
[1:37:23] glory. It is joy unspeakable
[1:37:27] and full of glory and the heart has
[1:37:31] heavy.
[1:37:33] [Applause]
[1:37:34] I have found the joy no tongue can tell
[1:37:40] how it waves of glory rolls.
[1:37:45] It is like a great overflow
[1:37:51] spring.
[1:37:54] Oh, it is joy. It is joy unspeakable
[1:37:59] and full of glory.
[1:38:02] Full of glory,

[1:38:29] It is joy unspeakable
[1:38:32] and full
[1:38:36] has never yet been told.
[1:38:40] Amen. Amen.
[1:38:43] Hallelujah. I trust that's how you feel.
[1:38:46] Amen. Let's uh let's pray. Amen. I just
[1:38:49] want to ask you the question. Have you
[1:38:51] gone within these through this river and
[1:38:53] veil? Do you know that extreme joy and
[1:38:56] peace that the church possesses?
[1:38:58] If you don't, you just want to say,
[1:38:59] Lord, I want to go beyond tradition. I
[1:39:02] want to go beyond how the world has
[1:39:05] dictated to me how I should worship you
[1:39:07] and walk with you. I want to go within
[1:39:09] the veil. I want to go into your
[1:39:10] presence, into the pillar of fire, and
[1:39:12] be changed forever. You just want to
[1:39:14] slip up your hand, say, "Lord, remember
[1:39:15] me." And we're going to pray. Gracious
[1:39:17] Father, we're so thankful that you rent
[1:39:20] the veil. Hallelujah. Lord, thank you,
[1:39:23] Lord. We can come into your divine
[1:39:25] presence and live forever. Lord Jesus,
[1:39:27] we're not separated from you no more.
[1:39:29] It's by your great sacrifice that day on
[1:39:31] Calvary that that that veil was rent,
[1:39:34] that the way into the holiest of holies
[1:39:36] was made made plain. We're so thankful,
[1:39:39] dear God, that that veil of tradition
[1:39:41] has been rent in this last day. That we
[1:39:43] don't worship you based on some idea of
[1:39:46] man. May we worship you by the
[1:39:48] revelation of the word. And I just want
[1:39:50] to ask, Father, may you touch each life
[1:39:52] here, those who have raised their hands.
[1:39:54] I pray, dear God, may they just go
[1:39:55] within that riven veil this morning.
[1:39:58] Father, may you fill them to overflowing
[1:39:59] with your Holy Spirit, dear God. And may
[1:40:01] they see the realities, Lord. May they
[1:40:03] experience the realities, Lord, of you
[1:40:06] in this day, dear God. A joy
[1:40:08] unspeakable, full of glory. A peace that
[1:40:10] passes all understanding. Dear God, a
[1:40:13] joy and a peace and a love and a
[1:40:16] thankfulness and a sincerity that's not
[1:40:18] based on any other condition but what
[1:40:20] you have done. Father, we ask these
[1:40:22] things for your glory, Lord, in Jesus
[1:40:24] Christ's name. And I ask, Father, that
[1:40:26] when we talk about things, dear God,
[1:40:29] when we fellowship the things on our
[1:40:31] hearts, Lord, may it not be the
[1:40:32] conditions that we're in right now,
[1:40:34] Lord. Yes, we're going through trouble
[1:40:36] and hardship and all those things, but
[1:40:38] Lord, may that may that not be the
[1:40:39] number one on our hearts, Lord. But I
[1:40:41] pray, Father, that it would be your
[1:40:43] goodness, your mercy, Lord, your love,
[1:40:46] Lord Jesus. Your oh, your grace is
[1:40:48] great, dear God. Your Hallelujah, Lord.
[1:40:51] Your love truly passes understanding,
[1:40:53] dear God. Lord, how you would save
[1:40:55] people like us. You'd reach down your
[1:40:57] mighty hand. Lord, you'd become one of
[1:40:59] us, oh God, the lowest of the low. That
[1:41:01] you'd lift us up into heavenly places.
[1:41:03] you'd lift us up above all things, my
[1:41:05] God. Father, may we just talk about
[1:41:06] those things, Lord. How our redemption
[1:41:08] has been made sure in this day, Lord,
[1:41:10] you've sealed us in the day of our
[1:41:12] redemption by your Holy Ghost, Father.
[1:41:14] Lord, that our our destination stands
[1:41:16] sure, Lord, because you have said that
[1:41:18] we will get there, Lord God, that your
[1:41:20] blood is more than enough, Father. We
[1:41:22] don't need to earn anything. We don't
[1:41:23] need to try and work things out there,
[1:41:25] God. We just accept you by faith and
[1:41:27] walk into your divine promises. We thank
[1:41:29] you for that, Father. Lord, we just want
[1:41:31] to just just say thank you, Lord, that
[1:41:33] you've blessed us, dear God. Lord, you
[1:41:35] said whom you have blessed is blessed
[1:41:36] and you cannot reverse the blessing. So,
[1:41:38] we just want to say, dear God, may that
[1:41:40] anchor into our hearts no matter what
[1:41:42] we're going through. We're not cursed by
[1:41:44] God. We're not shunned by him. We're not
[1:41:46] shunned by you, Lord Jesus, but we've
[1:41:47] been blessed by you. We're accepted in
[1:41:49] the beloved, dear God. We're passed from
[1:41:51] death unto life. And may we go
[1:41:52] rejoicing, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:41:56] Amen.
[1:41:57] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. and you

[1:52:35] Amen. We just pray this morning.
[1:52:38] Lord, we thank you, Lord, that
[1:52:41] it truly is joy unspeakable and full of
[1:52:43] glory to know you, Lord, and to the more
[1:52:46] we receive of you, the more joy we have
[1:52:48] in our hearts and in our lives, Lord.
[1:52:50] Lord, and I just pray that each one
[1:52:52] would be continue to be refreshed, Lord,
[1:52:55] by your spirit, Lord. That I believe
[1:52:57] there's a scripture that says the joy of
[1:52:59] the Lord is our strength, Lord. And
[1:53:01] that's that's something that it it it's
[1:53:05] not a
[1:53:07] it doesn't make sense, Lord, that
[1:53:11] when maybe Paul and Silas were re- they
[1:53:13] were in the prison, and yet there was
[1:53:15] something in them that they were joyful
[1:53:16] and they were rejoicing, Lord. There's
[1:53:19] such a power in you and that doesn't
[1:53:21] make sense that shouldn't be like how it
[1:53:24] is, Lord. And yet, in whatever situation
[1:53:26] we find ourselves in, if we're just
[1:53:28] filled with the spirit of God, we can be
[1:53:29] joyful and we can rejoice in you, Lord.
[1:53:32] So, I just pray that that would be each
[1:53:34] person here, that would be their portion
[1:53:35] each week, Lord, as we face each week.
[1:53:37] That Lord, it truly would be joy
[1:53:39] unspeakable and full of glory, Lord.
[1:53:42] That we'd just be refreshed by your
[1:53:43] spirit. That that as Paul said, none of
[1:53:45] these things move me, Lord. Right?
[1:53:49] We often think of Paul as such a great
[1:53:51] man and he had such an easy life. But
[1:53:52] yet all he had would were would were
[1:53:55] would bonds and imprisonments and all
[1:53:57] these things and yet through it all he
[1:53:58] had joy. Lord, each day he would have
[1:54:00] had joy. And not because he he he got
[1:54:04] himself into some mental state to think
[1:54:06] about it. But Lord, he was refreshed by
[1:54:08] your spirit daily. And and we know that
[1:54:10] in your spirit is joy, Lord. So I just
[1:54:11] pray a joy upon each person this week,
[1:54:15] Lord. Lord, may we go to that fountain
[1:54:17] of joy, Lord, and drink from that
[1:54:19] fountain of joy, which is you, Lord, and
[1:54:21] and and just begin to see how it changes
[1:54:23] our lives daily, Lord. How we can just
[1:54:25] be so joyful in every situation, Lord.
[1:54:27] So, we just thank you for the your word,
[1:54:29] Lord. We that we've heard this morning.
[1:54:31] I pray a blessing upon each one here.
[1:54:32] Just bless us as we go away. Ask in
[1:54:34] Jesus wonderful name. Amen. Praise the
[1:54:37] Lord Unicemith in Jesus name this
[1:54:38] morning.
