[4:58] Praise the Lord. Good
[5:00] morning. How are you? Good this morning.
[5:03] Praise the Lord. It's good to um see you
[5:05] all here. It's good
[5:07] to come before the living God this
[5:09] morning. I was just thinking there's a
[5:11] song, an old Well, I guess it's an old
[5:13] song. Some of the old-timers might know
[5:15] it. It's that one. From glory to glory,
[5:18] he's changing me. You know, anyone know
[5:20] that song? You know, and I was just
[5:22] thinking that's what, you know, that's
[5:24] what the Lord does in our life is that
[5:26] from glory to glory, he changes us, you
[5:29] know,
[5:30] and each and every day he's just he's
[5:33] he's making us more like him. Regardless
[5:35] of what we were to start with, that's
[5:37] irrelevant. And by the end of his
[5:39] process, we are like him. That's it.
[5:43] Yeah. It doesn't it doesn't matter where
[5:44] you came from. Doesn't matter doesn't
[5:45] matter what your upbringing was. It
[5:47] doesn't matter who your family is. It
[5:49] doesn't matter about
[5:50] anything. It doesn't matter from glory
[5:53] to glory. He's changing you and changing
[5:55] men. I I I was trying to find the verse
[5:57] and it was actually let's stand this
[5:59] morning as we just the verse was um but
[6:02] we all with open face beholding as in a
[6:05] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[6:07] into the same image from glory to glory
[6:10] even as by the spirit of the Lord.
[6:13] I just want to read you this other one
[6:14] that says another way of putting it. So
[6:17] all of us who have had that vow removed
[6:19] can see and reflect the glory of the
[6:21] Lord. And the Lord who is the spirit
[6:25] makes us more and more like him as we
[6:27] are changed into his glorious
[6:29] image. So that's what we are here for
[6:32] this morning is to be changed to become
[6:34] more like Christ into the image of the
[6:36] Lord. And that is what's going to happen
[6:38] this morning. Some of us are going to
[6:40] have a lot of work. Some of us can have
[6:41] just a few little minor things, but
[6:43] we're all going to be changed this
[6:44] morning to become more like the Lord. By
[6:46] the time that clock rings 12:30, we're
[6:49] changed a bit more. So, that's the God
[6:51] that we come to this morning. We to
[6:53] change us. Let's just let's commit
[6:54] ourselves to the Lord this morning,
[6:56] Lord. We thank you, Lord, that we can we
[6:58] thank you that we can come to you this
[6:59] morning, Lord Jesus, and be changed from
[7:01] glory to glory, Lord. And we know that
[7:03] in ourselves, we can't change ourselves,
[7:05] Lord. We don't have the capacity to work
[7:07] on ourselves or to make us more like
[7:09] you. We we don't know what that pathway
[7:11] is, Lord. We don't know how to do it. We
[7:13] don't have the means, Lord. But we're so
[7:15] thankful that you know the way. You You
[7:17] have the means. You know the pathway.
[7:19] You know the what needs to happen in
[7:20] each one of our lives to change us from
[7:22] glory to glory, Lord. And that's what we
[7:25] desire this morning is to be put upon
[7:27] your potter's will this morning and be
[7:28] changed, Lord, from to become more like
[7:30] you, Lord. To become less of us and more
[7:32] of you in our life, Lord. As John said,
[7:35] I must decrease and he must increase.
[7:37] Lord, may that may each one by the time
[7:39] we the service is finished this morning,
[7:40] may each one here have decrease more and
[7:43] you increase more in our life, Lord
[7:45] Jesus. That's what we desire, Lord. We
[7:46] we don't want to live in the flesh,
[7:48] Lord, but we want to walk in the spirit
[7:50] this morning, Lord Jesus, and continue
[7:51] to walk in your spirit. So, we just pray
[7:52] you bless each one. Bless the songs,
[7:54] bless the ministry, Lord. May you just
[7:56] come in a powerful way as we commit
[7:58] ourselves to you in the name of Jesus
[8:00] Christ. Amen. Praise the
[8:03] Lord. Do we know that? Let's do that
[8:05] song, actually.

[37:03] announcements. One is can we just after
[37:05] service can we have um all the tech team
[37:08] and all the musicians who are going to
[37:10] be here over Easter can we meet up
[37:11] because we need to plan how we're going
[37:13] to have service over Easter because a
[37:14] lot of us are away at the convention so
[37:16] and we're in Canada so you know so we
[37:18] need to make a plan for that. Um and
[37:20] also we'd like to have a youth service
[37:21] the first Sunday of May if that's all
[37:23] good. Okay so we'll plan that and um yes
[37:26] praise the Lord. So let's um let's turn
[37:29] to the scripture. We're going to go to
[37:31] um 1 Corinthians 13 and then we're going
[37:34] to go to 2 Corinthians chapter 3. And I
[37:36] always find it interesting. I always
[37:38] listen to brother Isaac's opening
[37:39] comments. And I just felt today, well, I
[37:42] pretty much might as well just sit down.
[37:44] We'll sing a song and go home because
[37:45] it's basically he just took one of my
[37:47] opening scriptures and here we are. So,
[37:49] praise the Lord. I like it when God does
[37:50] those things. Amen. So, praise the Lord.
[37:52] So, 1 Corinthians 13 uh verse4, we're
[37:55] going to read down to the end of the
[37:57] chapter, I believe it is. Yes. Here. So
[37:59] says, "Charity suffereth long and is
[38:02] kind. Charity envithth not. Charity
[38:04] vaunteth not itself. Is not puffed up,
[38:06] does not behave itself unseemly, seeketh
[38:08] not her own, is not easily provoked,
[38:11] thinkketh no evil, rejoicth not in
[38:14] iniquity, but rejoicth in the truth.
[38:16] Beareth all things, believeth all
[38:18] things, hopeeth all things, endureth all
[38:21] things, charity never faileth. But
[38:23] whether there be prophecies, they shall
[38:25] fail. Whether there be tongues, they
[38:26] shall cease. where there be knowledge,
[38:28] it shall vanish away. For we know in
[38:30] part, and we prophesy in part. But when
[38:33] that which is perfect is come, then that
[38:35] which is in part shall be done away.
[38:37] When I was a child, I spake as a child,
[38:39] I understood as a child. I thought as a
[38:42] child, but when I became a man, I put
[38:44] away childish things. For now, we see
[38:46] through a glass darkly, but then face to
[38:48] face. Now I know in part, but then shall
[38:51] I know even as also I am known. And now
[38:55] abideth faith, hope, charity, these
[38:57] three, but the greatest of these is
[38:59] charity. Amen. Then 2 Corinthians uh
[39:02] chapter 3 and from verse 13 down to
[39:04] verse uh 18 here.
[39:08] Um it's just one more piece of scripture
[39:10] we're going to read. And
[39:13] um Amen. So when you're there, you want
[39:16] to say amen. Amen. And and not as Moses,
[39:19] this is from verse 13, and not as Moses
[39:21] which put a veil over his face, that the
[39:23] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[39:25] look at the end uh of that which is
[39:27] abolished, but their minds were blinded.
[39:29] For until this day remainth, the same
[39:31] veil untaken away in the reading of the
[39:33] Old Testament, which veil is done away
[39:35] in Christ. But even unto this day, when
[39:38] Moses is read, the veil is upon their
[39:40] heart. Nevertheless, it shall it shall
[39:42] turn to the Lord, the veil shall be
[39:44] taken. Sorry. When it shall turn to the
[39:46] Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now
[39:48] the Lord is that spirit. And where the
[39:50] spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[39:52] But we all with open face, beholding as
[39:54] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[39:57] changed into the same image from glory
[39:58] to glory, even as by the spirit of the
[40:02] Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So,
[40:04] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[40:06] We just got one prayer, a couple of
[40:07] prayer requests. Got one is my sister
[40:08] Hannah is 41 weeks pregnant. She's
[40:11] wanting her baby to be born. So, we just
[40:12] pray that the Lord would touch her.
[40:14] should be all calm and and and and um
[40:16] their son will be born healthy, well,
[40:17] and strong. I think also the Bailey's
[40:19] and Poas are unwell. That's why they're
[40:21] not here. So, we're going to remember
[40:22] them in prayer. If there's any other
[40:23] need, you just want to slip your hand up
[40:25] to the Lord. Say, "Lord, remember me."
[40:27] Uh Lord, as you pass by this morning,
[40:29] amen. So, let's let's approach our
[40:31] father, almighty God, our father which
[40:34] are in heaven. Lord, your name is
[40:35] greatly to be praised this day. We want
[40:37] to thank you so much. We can stand here,
[40:39] Lord. Gather as a people to worship you
[40:41] in spirit and in truth. Dear God, thank
[40:43] you for your blood which still atones,
[40:45] Lord. Thank you, Lord. We can sing it as
[40:47] well with our souls, Lord, because you
[40:49] have shown us it as well. And Father, we
[40:52] just want to remember the uh Lord, my
[40:53] sister Hannah, dear God, she's one week
[40:55] overdue. I just pray, Father, you'd
[40:57] touch her, dear God. May may may today
[40:59] be the day, Lord God, when contractions
[41:02] start. And Lord, when when their son is
[41:03] born, and may she be relaxed and may you
[41:06] just be, Lord, be present there with
[41:07] with her. and Lord and Chris, Lord
[41:09] Jesus. Bless them, Lord. And may may
[41:11] their son be born well, Father. May may
[41:13] there be no complications. And we also
[41:15] want to remember the POS, Lord, the
[41:16] Bailey's who are unwell in body. Father,
[41:18] pray you touch them, dear God. Anyone
[41:20] else who's not here because of sickness,
[41:22] Father, thank you for the power of your
[41:24] blood, Lord, which we can call upon your
[41:26] great name that you would touch them.
[41:27] And Father, any Lord, there's many needs
[41:29] among us, Lord. Where there's people,
[41:31] there's needs, dear God. So, Father, may
[41:33] you touch every need. If it's spiritual,
[41:35] financial, physical, whatever it is,
[41:36] dear God, I pray you'd meet the need
[41:38] today through your word and may you
[41:40] anoint the word that that we have just
[41:42] read. Lord, anoint us as speaker and
[41:43] hearer as well. And may you be
[41:45] glorified, Father, in our midst in Jesus
[41:47] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[41:50] you, friends. You can you can have your
[41:52] seat. So, I want to speak about the uh
[41:55] the power of revelation today. And it's
[41:58] very I don't think this can ever be
[42:00] underemphasized or even overemphasized
[42:04] is the power of revelation in our lives.
[42:06] Now we read here we read here in uh 1
[42:09] Corinthians 13 and I just want to draw
[42:12] your attention to this that that the
[42:14] apostle Paul would say that there would
[42:16] come a day where we don't where where
[42:19] that which is perfect has come that
[42:21] which is in part shall be done away.
[42:22] Now, brother Brown makes a statement
[42:24] that he said by God's grace, we have the
[42:26] perfect interpretation to the word of
[42:28] God. So that which is perfect has come.
[42:31] Now I say that because it places this
[42:33] scripture where you can see the apostle
[42:35] Paul is placing this in the future. It's
[42:37] actually now this is in manifestation.
[42:40] Now brother Bram says that that which is
[42:42] perfect has come and that which is part
[42:44] is done away. And what that in part done
[42:46] away is is trying to manufacture
[42:48] Christianity. He's trying to speak in
[42:50] tongues. that which is the part that's
[42:52] the childish thing. So the gifts and
[42:54] everything is still here right because
[42:56] it's part of the scripture it's part of
[42:57] the word but now it's come to its
[42:59] perfect place where it's God doing it
[43:02] through the people. Amen. So we have the
[43:04] perfect interpretation to the word. So
[43:06] so the apostle Paul is saying I'm now
[43:09] seeing through a glass darkly but then
[43:11] when the perfect interpretation comes
[43:13] when that which is perfect has come I'll
[43:15] see him face to face. So this is this
[43:16] day. Amen. And then I shall know even as
[43:19] also I am known. So God has a revelation
[43:22] of you and I. And and now is the season
[43:26] where we're not wondering what he thinks
[43:28] of us. We're not guessing what he thinks
[43:30] about us, we know because he reveals his
[43:33] thoughts of us towards you and I. Now we
[43:36] understand that God's thoughts cannot
[43:38] change. So what he thought of you before
[43:40] the foundation of the world, that's how
[43:42] you're going to be. Amen. So he thought
[43:43] of you as an overcomer, victorious, made
[43:46] in the image of his word. He, you know,
[43:48] he made you exactly like him, right?
[43:50] That's how he thought of you. And now
[43:52] he's going to pour that revelation into
[43:54] you through the opening of the word,
[43:55] through the message of the hour that you
[43:57] would now know as you are known.
[43:59] Hallelujah. This is incredibly important
[44:01] because there's nothing and I and I'll
[44:04] come to it, but there's nothing as as
[44:06] important or nothing as prevailing as
[44:09] the power of revelation. Okay. So now as
[44:11] as we read here in 2 Corinthians 13, now
[44:15] that as we behold the word, we are
[44:17] changed. As we behold him, we are
[44:19] changed. Now, that word changed is where
[44:21] we get the in the Greek, it's the word
[44:23] metamorphos. So, it's where we get the
[44:24] word metamorphosis. So, there's a
[44:26] transformation like a caterpillar to a
[44:28] butterfly goes on that that there's a
[44:30] transformation going on on the inside.
[44:33] Amen. That you know, even you know, in a
[44:35] cryis, you can't see the transformation,
[44:37] but it happens, right? And people look
[44:40] at you and you say, well, you're the
[44:41] same old person living in the same old
[44:43] body. Amen. Sure, there's a slight
[44:45] change, but you know, they can't see the
[44:47] full transformation going on in the
[44:48] inside. Amen. But when these bodies are
[44:51] changed, they'll see there's a
[44:52] difference. Amen. So, this is where we
[44:55] get the word metamorphosis, which is to
[44:56] be transformed. Amen. Change. It means,
[44:59] so we're as we behold the word, we're
[45:01] transformed into the word. Now, brother
[45:04] Brand makes this statement here. He
[45:06] says, "Now, the Greek word for
[45:07] revelation is apocalypse, which means
[45:09] the unveiling." So the book of
[45:11] revelation is the unveiling of Jesus
[45:13] Christ. Okay. Now this unveiling is
[45:16] perfectly described in the as an example
[45:18] of a sculptor unveiling his work um of
[45:21] of of a statue. So I can't say that word
[45:23] just now exposing it to the onlooker. It
[45:26] is an uncovering revealing what was
[45:28] previously hidden. Now the uncovering is
[45:31] not only the revelation of the person of
[45:33] Christ. It is the revelation of his
[45:35] future work in oncoming seven church
[45:37] ages. the the importance of revelation
[45:39] by the spirit to a true believer can
[45:41] never be overemphasized. Revelation more
[45:44] means more to you than you perhaps
[45:46] realize. Now, I'm not talking about this
[45:48] book of Revelation and you. I'm talking
[45:50] about all Revelation. It is tremendously
[45:52] important to the church. Amen. Because
[45:56] now we got to realize that revelation is
[45:58] more than a a a scriptural truth
[46:01] becoming clear. It's more than just an
[46:04] oh, that's a nice idea. That's a nice
[46:06] thought. like it's something that's ex
[46:08] that's that's external from the believer
[46:10] that you just kind of acquire. But
[46:12] actually revelation is the unveiling of
[46:15] what's already within you. I mean
[46:16] because remember we already we always
[46:18] were believers, right? We had to come to
[46:21] a point where we realized we were
[46:22] believers. That's when we gave our life
[46:23] to the Lord and he filled us with the
[46:25] Holy Ghost to signify we're his
[46:27] children. But we always were like
[46:29] brother Bram said that to have eternal
[46:30] life, you always had it, right? You
[46:33] didn't receive it when you gave your
[46:34] heart to the Lord. You always had it.
[46:36] But that came to a point where you
[46:37] recognize who you really were. So you
[46:40] surrendered your human will over to God
[46:42] and let him come and change you to match
[46:45] who you already are in your soul. Amen.
[46:48] So, so, so, so the revelation of Jesus
[46:50] Christ and his works in the future
[46:52] church ages also speaks of you. Amen.
[46:55] Because this because because his future
[46:58] works, what is that? What is the main
[46:59] part of his future works? It's the
[47:01] manifestation of the overcomers in each
[47:03] age. I mean, it's more than knowing what
[47:05] the horse riders are. It's actually
[47:07] knowing who you are in the scripture. I
[47:09] mean, that's the most important thing.
[47:11] So, so his, so it's he's going to unveil
[47:14] who the overcomers are in each age. So,
[47:16] he's actually unveiling you, revealing
[47:18] that on the inside of you. You are an
[47:21] overcomer already. You got to realize
[47:23] it. Amen. That's what the revelation of
[47:26] the word does. It causes you to realize
[47:28] who you really are. Amen. So the see the
[47:32] see the believer, we had no idea who we
[47:34] were until God be to take the veil off
[47:36] our life. Amen. I thought I was a
[47:39] sport-loving kid from Gisbon. That's
[47:41] right. I come to find out I was totally
[47:44] wrong. Praise God. I come to find out
[47:48] when the veil came off my life. I mean,
[47:50] I wasn't a Kiwi living in this place and
[47:52] being a, you know, studying science and
[47:55] whatever more and loving sport. No, when
[47:57] the veil came off, I saw I was a son of
[47:59] God. I already was a son of God, but the
[48:02] but the revelation of the word revealed
[48:04] who I already was. Amen. Praise the
[48:08] Lord. Amen. So
[48:10] now, Brother Bam says this here, I'm
[48:12] just trying to follow my notes today. As
[48:14] I've always um as he says here in the
[48:16] revel um this in the church age book, as
[48:18] I have already said, this book
[48:20] revelation is the consummation of the
[48:21] scriptures. It's even placed perfectly
[48:23] right in the cannon of scripture at the
[48:25] end. Now you can know um you can know
[48:27] why it says that anyone who reads it or
[48:29] hears it will be blessed. It is the
[48:31] revelation of God that will give you
[48:33] authority over the devil and you can see
[48:36] why they they who would add or take away
[48:39] from it would be cursed. It would have
[48:40] to be so. For who can add or take away
[48:42] from the perfect revelation of God and
[48:44] overcome the enemy? You cannot. I mean
[48:47] it is that simple. There is nothing as
[48:48] such prevailing power as the revelation
[48:52] of the word. Amen. So revelation is the
[48:55] main thing. It's the main thing. Amen.
[48:58] Even salvation has to be a revelation.
[49:01] Amen. When it's revealed to you Jesus
[49:02] died for you personally on Calvary, it
[49:05] changes your whole life. It changed my
[49:07] life. That's for sure. I was never the
[49:09] same person again when he took the veil
[49:11] off it and showed me that that actually
[49:13] I am part of his plan of redemption. It
[49:16] changes everything. Amen. Everything
[49:18] stems from the revelation of the word.
[49:20] Amen. And if you want victory, it comes
[49:23] from revelation. Amen. If you want the
[49:25] peace of God that passes all
[49:27] understanding, it comes from revelation.
[49:29] If you want joy, it comes from
[49:31] revelation. Amen. That's why David could
[49:33] dance before the ark as it was coming
[49:35] into his city is because he was
[49:37] rejoicing you. Because when McCall
[49:39] challenged him about his, you know,
[49:41] about his worship, he said, "No, it's
[49:43] because God has chosen me." Amen. To
[49:45] become king. He had great joy. He had
[49:47] revelation. And God had chose him to be
[49:50] in this position and that's why he
[49:52] rejoiced because it was God's choosing.
[49:53] This was God's work in his life. So his
[49:56] dance came from revelation. Hallelujah.
[49:59] Amen. Amen. Revelation of what? The
[50:01] revelation of who you are in Christ.
[50:04] Amen. Is absolutely fundamental. If
[50:06] you're struggling in your walk with God,
[50:08] pray for revelation. Amen. If you're if
[50:10] you're becoming doubleminded about a
[50:12] decision, pray for revelation. Because
[50:14] doublemindedness brings spiritual
[50:16] amnesia. Amen. That's putting a veil
[50:18] back on something. But God's word has
[50:20] come to take the veil off. Amen. It
[50:22] doesn't matter what happens in our
[50:24] lives. We can seek God in that and we
[50:26] can realize because what is the greatest
[50:28] revelation? Who Jesus Christ is. Amen.
[50:31] And once because brother Ram says, "What
[50:33] is the new birth?" The revelation of
[50:35] Jesus Christ personally to you. Amen.
[50:37] You may shout, you may scream, you may
[50:39] cry all those things, but it is the
[50:41] revelation of Jesus Christ to you. Amen.
[50:44] That is the new birth. Amen. It's how it
[50:46] works. come in all different ways but
[50:48] that is the main thing because when you
[50:50] realize who he is then you know who you
[50:51] are. Amen. So if you're struggling in
[50:54] any part of your life say God give me
[50:56] revelation.
[50:57] Amen. I could I don't think I could ever
[50:59] o uh overemphasize that. That's why
[51:02] people struggle to look at the world and
[51:04] look at the word what they need is a
[51:06] revelation.
[51:07] Amen. And it brings it brings everything
[51:10] into the right perspective. And see even
[51:13] insecurities are overcome by revelation.
[51:16] You feel insecure. You don't feel
[51:17] comfortable in your own skin. Cuz it's
[51:19] funny. Everyone wants to be someone
[51:21] else. If you've got straight hair, you
[51:23] want curly hair. If you've got no hair,
[51:26] you want hair. If you want, if you got
[51:28] light skin, you want dark skin. If you
[51:29] got dark, you want light skin. There's
[51:30] all this. The whole world wants to be
[51:32] someone else. It's the cultural pressure
[51:34] of the age. They everyone wants to
[51:36] change. You want brown eyes. Yeah. You
[51:38] got blue eyes, you want brown eyes. Or
[51:39] brown eyes, blue eyes. Or green eyes,
[51:41] you know, whatever. you know, big nose,
[51:43] small nose, big ears, you want small,
[51:44] you know, all those things. You're
[51:46] extrovert, well, you're an introvert,
[51:48] you want to be an extrovert. Extrovert,
[51:49] you want to be an introvert. You know,
[51:51] so what it is is is there's a the spirit
[51:53] of Lady Oia brings a pressure in that
[51:56] makes you feel
[51:57] insecure. A Amen. But what conquers that
[52:00] revelation? Amen. Cuz when it's revealed
[52:03] to you, you're a son of God, you're at
[52:04] rest saying, God, you made me this way
[52:06] for a purpose. Amen. You built me. Amen.
[52:09] You gave me this temperament, this
[52:11] characteristic, everything because you
[52:12] want to express your word through that
[52:15] to the world. Absolutely. Amen. So if
[52:18] you feel insecure, pray for revelation.
[52:21] Amen. Revelation will prevail over that.
[52:23] Amen. See, when it's revealed to you, so
[52:26] for example, you know, if you came out
[52:27] of the world, when it's revealed to you
[52:29] that smoking, drinking, partying,
[52:30] gossiping, gaming, just being a church
[52:33] member, it isn't who you are because
[52:35] you're a child of God, you repent of
[52:37] that real quick. Amen. because you
[52:39] realize you've allowed that thing to
[52:41] rule your life. That's why you repent.
[52:43] Lord, forgive me that I've been living
[52:44] as a slave when I should be living as a
[52:46] son of God because you've revealed to me
[52:48] I am a son of God. Amen. And those
[52:51] things by the power of revelation go
[52:53] beneath you and they are dead. That's
[52:56] what re revelation kills. Not the
[52:58] believer, the enemy.
[53:01] Amen. So this is so important that we
[53:03] that we always in everything in life
[53:06] pray for revelation. Amen. God gives you
[53:09] the revelation you're his child. You're
[53:10] never out of his care. You never be
[53:13] begging bread. God will look after you
[53:14] in every situation. Doesn't matter what
[53:16] the world economics are doing. God will
[53:18] take care of you. God will make sure his
[53:20] word is poured into you. Amen. Because
[53:22] he's ordained that you'd be formed into
[53:23] the fullness of the image of his word.
[53:25] So God will inspire some preacher
[53:27] somewhere to speak to you. Amen. He'll
[53:29] pour his anointing into you. Amen.
[53:31] Because you have been it's been revealed
[53:33] to you. You are his son or daughter. So
[53:35] you're never out of his care.
[53:39] Amen. You see, we must have faith in
[53:44] what the word says we are. Right now,
[53:47] remember, when it's revealed to you,
[53:49] when this when this is revealed to you,
[53:51] you're a son or daughter of God, you are
[53:52] this and you're actually one. You're not
[53:55] separate from the word. You're part of
[53:57] this word. You're an expression of this
[53:59] word. Amen. And
[54:02] so Jesus, so so I'm just going to read.
[54:05] Sorry if there's a lot of reading today,
[54:06] but I just want this to really sink in.
[54:07] Now remember, the only thing you have to
[54:08] do then, so if this revelation has
[54:10] struck your life, and I believe it has.
[54:12] It's why you're here that you're a son
[54:13] or daughter of God. Then you have to
[54:15] have faith in what you are. You must
[54:17] have faith in what you are. Have faith
[54:19] in what the word says you are. That's
[54:22] why it's so important. You feel, you
[54:24] know, you feel down, there's a double
[54:26] minus or you're struggling or the
[54:27] devil's pouring on pressure. What do you
[54:29] do? Go back into the word and identify
[54:32] what it says you are. you're a believer.
[54:36] Amen. You may have struggles, you're
[54:38] still a believer. You may have
[54:39] questions, you're still a believer. You
[54:41] may have temptation, you're still a
[54:43] believer. Amen. None of those things
[54:44] change the fact you're a believer. Amen.
[54:46] So, it's so important that we keep we
[54:48] always go back into the scripture. Not
[54:50] what Instagram says we are. Not even
[54:53] what our friends say we are. Not sure
[54:55] what the devil says we are, but what the
[54:57] word says we are. Jesus had faith in the
[54:59] word. What? that said what he was.
[55:04] He had faith in that. Amen. And Jesus
[55:06] had sorry it is written of me. Didn't
[55:08] David and the Psalms and the prophets
[55:10] all them speak of him? I am the bread of
[55:12] life that came from God out of heaven.
[55:14] Amen. I am that tree of life from the
[55:16] garden of Eden. I am all these things. I
[55:18] am that I am. He knew with that perfect
[55:20] faith that he was the anointed Messiah
[55:23] that the spirit of God was upon him. He
[55:24] said, "Now I in myself do nothing, but
[55:27] it's my faith in God." And God was in
[55:29] him. the word made manifest. And when
[55:31] the word of God comes in you, it's made
[55:33] manifest. For you're a believer. See,
[55:35] and a believer is the faith of God that
[55:38] moves in you. Amen. So the word of God,
[55:40] if the Holy Ghost is in you, the word of
[55:42] God is in you. Amen. The word of God is
[55:45] in you. So if the word of God is in you,
[55:46] you can have perfect faith now and what
[55:48] God has made you to be. You say, "Well,
[55:51] I didn't feel it." You don't have to
[55:52] feel nothing. What do you choose to
[55:53] believe? Amen. What do you decide?
[55:56] Because there's two options, but your
[55:57] choice dictates which way you're going
[55:59] to go. Are you choose to going to be be
[56:01] an unbeliever or are you going to choose
[56:03] to be a real believer?
[56:06] I choose to be a real believer. Do I
[56:08] feel it? Do I think it? Do I agree with
[56:10] it? That's irrelevant. I choose to agree
[56:13] with the word that I'm a believer.
[56:16] Amen. Jesus had perfect faith in in in
[56:19] who he was. You say, "Well, but but he
[56:21] wasn't born with spiritual amnesia. He
[56:23] knew who he was from the beginning."
[56:25] That is true. That's why the spirit of
[56:27] God has come in this age to take that
[56:29] amnesia out of our lives. The revelation
[56:31] you've been unveiled. You don't realize
[56:33] it, but God has taken the covering off
[56:35] of your life to show what's already
[56:38] within you. Amen. You know, an artist
[56:40] that builds a sculpture, he's not busy
[56:42] chiseling as the veil comes off. It's
[56:45] already there. It's just going to be
[56:46] made manifest. The sunlight's got to
[56:48] come and reveal what's already there.
[56:50] It's the same thing with you and I,
[56:51] friends. He says, "Now watch now." and
[56:53] he and he to us if you abide in
[56:57] me. So I'm just trying
[57:01] to make sure I've got everything here.
[57:04] Here he says, "Now watch now." He said
[57:06] to us, "If you abide in me in my word
[57:08] and you St. John here, you can ask what
[57:10] you will. It'll be done. Then recognize
[57:12] your position in the scripture as a
[57:14] believer." See, you've got to recognize
[57:16] your position as he recognized his
[57:18] position. Amen. So, you've got to
[57:20] recognize your place and position as a
[57:22] believer. This is very important. Amen.
[57:24] Now, it's not now it's very important
[57:26] that we that we do not allow the devil
[57:29] to place us in the scripture. Amen.
[57:31] Because he could not even correctly
[57:33] identify the Lord Jesus as the Messiah.
[57:36] Because when he was tempting the Lord
[57:37] Jesus in the desert, he said, "If thou
[57:39] be the son of God, if thou be the son of
[57:41] God." So, he wasn't sure. So he could
[57:43] not he could not position if he could
[57:45] not position the son of God, our messiah
[57:48] in the position in the scripture
[57:50] correctly, how on earth is he going to
[57:51] place you and I? Amen. So the devil will
[57:55] try and make us think, you know, see he
[57:58] will he will he will try and place us as
[58:00] a no hopeer. Amen. That that you know
[58:03] what am I even doing here kind of a
[58:05] person. I just don't feel like a
[58:07] believer. I just don't feel like I have
[58:08] faith. He'll try and position you that
[58:10] way. Amen. But you've got to identify,
[58:13] recognize your position in the scripture
[58:15] as a believer. Amen. I'm like Joshua.
[58:19] I'm a believer like Peter. Sure, I've
[58:20] had my ups and downs and my failures,
[58:22] but there's something in me that wants
[58:23] to get to Jesus. Amen. I'm like John.
[58:25] I'm like the woman at the well. Amen.
[58:27] Had a troubled past and broken, you
[58:29] know, cycles of pain and hurt and all
[58:31] these things. But one day, the word came
[58:33] my way. Amen. The Messiah came my way
[58:36] and revealed himself. He took the veil
[58:38] off himself to me and took the veil by
[58:40] the same way took the veil off of my
[58:41] life. Amen. I know who I am now. Amen.
[58:44] I'm like the woman with the blood issue.
[58:46] Tried everything to find satisfaction
[58:47] and peace. But one day I heard the
[58:49] master was passing by and he gave me
[58:51] faith to touch the hem of his garment by
[58:53] faith. And now I'm no longer the same.
[58:55] Amen. I'm like Jeras, a good church
[58:57] member, but needs Jesus to come to his
[58:59] house to raise up a dead child. Amen.
[59:01] I'm like Legion. Amen. bound and
[59:03] separated by darkness in the tombs,
[59:05] living in death and skulls and hatred
[59:07] and malice and strife. But Jesus knew
[59:10] where I was. Amen. Jesus came and found
[59:12] me. Hallelujah. Amen. So I'm like them.
[59:14] Amen. Cuz they are real believers. Amen.
[59:17] It's like think like brother Isaac said,
[59:19] doesn't matter how you start, that's
[59:20] irrelevant. Amen. That just means you
[59:22] got a big covering over you, but God's
[59:24] here to take the veil off of your life
[59:26] to show you who you really are.
[59:28] Hallelujah. So I think we should
[59:30] identify ourselves. They all had
[59:32] problems. They all had questions. They
[59:34] all had struggles. But they are real
[59:36] believers.
[59:38] Amen. Being a real believer does not
[59:39] mean you're absent from trouble, trials,
[59:41] or stress, pain, or anguish, or sorrow.
[59:44] It's all there. But you're a real
[59:46] believer. Doesn't change that fact.
[59:49] Amen. Praise the Lord. Joshua uh Joshua
[59:53] would would uh
[59:55] recognize who he was by revelation.
[59:58] Revelation gives authority over every
[1:00:00] work of darkness. Amen. The revelation
[1:00:02] of who you are. Joshua recognized his
[1:00:05] position in the word as a believer. He
[1:00:08] was not a makebeliever. He was not an
[1:00:09] unbeliever. He didn't join up with Kora
[1:00:12] and Dayan and try and split the church
[1:00:13] in the wilderness. He didn't stay in
[1:00:15] Egypt with the Egyptians and didn't
[1:00:16] apply the blood. No, he was a real
[1:00:19] believer. Amen. And because Joshua
[1:00:23] because of revelation, it was revealed
[1:00:25] to him. He was a manifestation of the
[1:00:27] promise of God given to Abraham. So he
[1:00:29] had a revelation, I am a manifestation
[1:00:32] of the word for my day. Amen. As as as
[1:00:35] God would tell uh Abraham in Genesis
[1:00:38] 15:16, "But in the fourth generation,
[1:00:40] thou come hither again where to the
[1:00:42] promised land, for the iniquity of the
[1:00:44] Amorites is not yet full." Hallelujah.
[1:00:47] So Joshua, God revealed to him, you're
[1:00:50] part of that prophecy. Amen. Because
[1:00:53] you're going to bring them hither again.
[1:00:55] You're part of the fulfillment of that.
[1:00:56] Who's with me today? Amen. You see, so
[1:00:58] the prophecy, the word, it went from a
[1:01:00] nice idea or a nice promise of something
[1:01:02] that's going to happen in the future to
[1:01:04] a living reality. Amen. God gave him the
[1:01:07] revelation. You are part of the
[1:01:08] fulfillment of this. Amen. So the
[1:01:11] prophecy became unveiled to Joshua and
[1:01:13] he saw by revelation that he wasn't
[1:01:15] going to just come out of Egypt. He was
[1:01:17] going into the promised land. And the
[1:01:20] reason he was going to the promised land
[1:01:21] is because he was a son of God. Amen. As
[1:01:24] the prophecy, you know, I think it said
[1:01:26] in Hosea and Matthew and it was speaking
[1:01:28] of of of Israel coming out of Egypt.
[1:01:31] Also speaking of Christ coming out of
[1:01:32] Egypt, but it would say out of Egypt I
[1:01:34] have called my son. Amen. And Joshua
[1:01:37] knew that he was part of part of, you
[1:01:39] know, he was he was part of that. Amen.
[1:01:42] To come out of come out of Egypt.
[1:01:44] Now, praise the Lord. So, so
[1:01:47] Joshua, he realized that he was he was
[1:01:51] part of this revelation. It gave him
[1:01:54] authority in every battle he fought
[1:01:57] because remember, revelation places you
[1:01:59] as a son of God. If you're placed as a
[1:02:02] son of God, you've got dominion over
[1:02:03] everything.
[1:02:05] Amen. And so Joshua was told by God, he
[1:02:09] said, "My servant Moses is dead. Now
[1:02:11] therefore arise, go over this Jordan.
[1:02:13] Thou and all this people unto a land
[1:02:14] that I do give to them, even to the
[1:02:16] children of Israel. Every place of the
[1:02:18] soul of your foot shall tread upon that
[1:02:20] have I given you as I said unto Moses.
[1:02:22] And it says in verse 5, there shall not
[1:02:24] be any man able to stand before thee all
[1:02:25] the days of thy life. For as I was with
[1:02:27] Moses, so I'll be with thee. I'll not
[1:02:29] fail thee nor forsake thee. And the
[1:02:32] reason he could no man could stand
[1:02:33] before him is because he had the
[1:02:35] revelation, I'm a son of God. See, his
[1:02:37] victories all stem from revelation.
[1:02:39] Amen. I'm going to repeat this cuz you
[1:02:41] got to realize overcoming power is from
[1:02:43] revelation. Victory is from revelation.
[1:02:46] Joy, peace, love, answered prayer,
[1:02:48] everything. Your trust in God comes from
[1:02:50] revelation. We can be still and know
[1:02:52] that he is God is because of revelation.
[1:02:54] Amen. So, so he there he was and he was
[1:02:58] instructed to to take the children of
[1:03:00] Israel over over Jordan, place them in
[1:03:03] the land. But the reason he did that is
[1:03:04] because it was revealed to him. He was
[1:03:06] part of the fulfillment of that.
[1:03:07] friends, we're part of the fulfillment
[1:03:09] of the word.
[1:03:11] Amen. Revelation places us in the
[1:03:12] scripture. Amen. That we actually
[1:03:14] literally stepped out of the prophecy of
[1:03:16] the Bible. Amen. Because you see Joshua
[1:03:19] when when when Abraham told told um or
[1:03:22] sorry, God told Abraham that, you know,
[1:03:24] they're going to come back to the
[1:03:25] promised land and they're going to be
[1:03:26] slaves and all these different things.
[1:03:29] There was no mention of the name of
[1:03:30] Joshua or Moses or the Pharaoh or
[1:03:33] anything. But when God spoke it in his
[1:03:35] mind, he knew those details were part of
[1:03:37] that prophecy. Amen. So, so Joshua by
[1:03:40] revelation realized I'm part of this
[1:03:42] word. So if I'm part of this word and
[1:03:44] God says that we're going to possess the
[1:03:45] land, we're going to possess the land.
[1:03:49] Amen. So it was revealed to him and now
[1:03:52] he So it was revealed to Joshua that he
[1:03:55] was part of the word. It was revealed to
[1:03:58] him his position in that prophecy. And
[1:04:00] because he was part of the word, now the
[1:04:03] word has full authority. The word has
[1:04:05] full authority everywhere. It has
[1:04:08] authority in heaven. It has authority in
[1:04:10] earth. It's got authority in hell. It's
[1:04:12] got authority over every devil, every
[1:04:14] sickness, every disease, every
[1:04:16] circumstance. The word has full supreme
[1:04:19] authority. And because Joshua had a
[1:04:22] revelation, he was part of that word.
[1:04:24] And that word has supreme authority.
[1:04:26] Then nothing could stand before him
[1:04:28] until the work was completed. Amen.
[1:04:30] That's why he could stand there. Amen.
[1:04:32] He was anointed by that word. The same
[1:04:33] inspiration that said, "Let there be
[1:04:35] sun, moon, and stars." Was now in him.
[1:04:37] Amen. By revelation, he knew he was
[1:04:39] placed as a son of God above nature. I
[1:04:42] mean, above everything. I mean, he had
[1:04:43] supreme authority cuz he why he had the
[1:04:46] revelation. I'm part of the fulfillment.
[1:04:48] That's why he could stand there and say,
[1:04:49] "Son, stand still. Moon, stand still."
[1:04:51] He was inspired by the word to speak
[1:04:53] those things. That wasn't his idea. That
[1:04:55] was God's idea moving through him. Amen.
[1:04:58] Because he had the revelation, I'm a son
[1:04:59] of God, he could let God speak through
[1:05:01] him and do what God wanted to do.
[1:05:04] Amen. Praise the
[1:05:06] Lord. Amen. But when Joshua when Joshua
[1:05:10] was in Egypt, his true self was not
[1:05:13] veiled. I mean, sorry, was still veiled.
[1:05:15] He was like the rest of them, a slave.
[1:05:18] Amen. Caleb was a slave, too. They were
[1:05:20] all and they would all gather no doubt
[1:05:22] and they would speak about the promised
[1:05:23] deliverer that was going to come. They
[1:05:25] were looking at the uh conditions of the
[1:05:28] world and all these things and they they
[1:05:31] would be excited that the deliverer was
[1:05:33] going to come. But what caused the veil
[1:05:35] to come off come off Joshua and Caleb's
[1:05:38] life. Was it the miracles that Moses
[1:05:40] did? No. Cuz they all saw the same
[1:05:43] miracles. They all walked through the
[1:05:44] same Red Sea. They saw the pillar of
[1:05:46] fire move and different things and the
[1:05:49] flies and the frogs and the light and go
[1:05:51] darkness in Egypt. They all saw those
[1:05:53] miracles. So the supernatural didn't
[1:05:55] take the veil off. It gathered the
[1:05:57] people, but it didn't take the veil off.
[1:05:59] What was the thing that took the veil
[1:06:00] off? It was the word of God Moses
[1:06:02] preached. Amen. The the the anointed
[1:06:05] preaching of the word will take the veil
[1:06:06] off a son or daughter of God to reveal
[1:06:08] to them who they really are. Amen.
[1:06:10] That's why Joshua and Caleb were not
[1:06:12] like the uh 10 other spies cuz they were
[1:06:15] veiled. They still had a slave
[1:06:16] mentality. How many times that the
[1:06:18] people they would see signs and wonders,
[1:06:20] but because it wasn't a revelation that
[1:06:22] they were that they were, you know,
[1:06:24] going to go into the promised land, they
[1:06:25] were still veiled with a slave
[1:06:27] mentality. That's when you see someone
[1:06:29] you know and you love and you see they
[1:06:31] still got a slave mentality to sin. You
[1:06:33] say, "Lord, take the veil off their
[1:06:35] life. Lord, give them revelation of who
[1:06:37] who they really are." Amen.
[1:06:40] Amen. But you see now, see, it was the
[1:06:43] message of Moses that unveiled who Caleb
[1:06:46] really was to himself. Amen. See, and it
[1:06:49] was and it was also the message of
[1:06:51] Moses. It was the revelation of it that
[1:06:53] caused the young generation not to side
[1:06:55] with the older generation that wanted to
[1:06:57] go back into the wilderness, wanted to
[1:06:59] go back into Egypt and want to do all
[1:07:01] those things. But the veil came off them
[1:07:03] by the preaching of the word that they
[1:07:04] weren't going backwards, they were going
[1:07:06] forwards. Amen. They were going into
[1:07:07] their inheritance. Amen. And it's the
[1:07:10] message of the hour that gives us
[1:07:11] revelation of the word and gives you
[1:07:12] revelation of who you really
[1:07:15] are. Amen.
[1:07:18] You need to find yourself as a believer
[1:07:20] in the scripture. It's like it says in
[1:07:22] Malachi 4:5, "Behold, I send you Elijah
[1:07:25] the prophet before the great and
[1:07:26] dreadful day of the Lord." I trust God's
[1:07:29] given you the revelation that the you in
[1:07:31] that scripture is you. Amen. He sends
[1:07:34] you. You put your name there. He sent
[1:07:36] you Elijah the prophet before the great
[1:07:38] and dreadful day of the Lord. Before the
[1:07:39] great tribulation sets and before the
[1:07:41] wrath of God is poured out upon this
[1:07:43] earth, he's going to send you Elijah.
[1:07:45] And what's the purpose? That God is
[1:07:46] going to turn your heart. Amen. Back to
[1:07:48] the faith of the original fathers.
[1:07:51] Hallelujah. I mean, you got to see
[1:07:52] yourself in that scripture. That's why
[1:07:54] this message has impacted you. Amen.
[1:07:56] It's impacted you. It's moved you. It's
[1:07:58] It's made you live a certain way because
[1:08:00] God has literally turned your hearts
[1:08:02] back to the original apostolic faith of
[1:08:04] the word.
[1:08:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. That's what God
[1:08:08] has done. You got to realize what's
[1:08:10] because the devil wants to always
[1:08:11] diminish the work of God in your life.
[1:08:13] God's doing a mighty work. He's doing an
[1:08:15] incredible thing. Amen. To turn a
[1:08:17] people's heart back to the faith of the
[1:08:19] whole word of God. Amen. Not just to
[1:08:20] take creeds and dogmas and nice ideas,
[1:08:23] but the whole word. We believe it. Amen.
[1:08:26] What did that? God did it. Not your
[1:08:28] upbringing. Upbringing is good, but not
[1:08:30] your upbringing. It's God taking the
[1:08:32] veil off. I mean, that's why I always
[1:08:33] pray, God, give everyone a revelation.
[1:08:36] Reveal to them who you are. Reveal to
[1:08:38] them who they are in you, Lord. Amen.
[1:08:41] Like Revelations 10:8-11. John's
[1:08:43] commanded to take the book, the open
[1:08:45] book, out of the hands of the angel, the
[1:08:47] mighty angel. He's commanded to take the
[1:08:49] book and eat the book and prophesy
[1:08:50] again. John there in the scripture
[1:08:52] represents the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:54] Amen. When they take this message, they
[1:08:56] become one with this message. Amen. And
[1:08:58] then they speak it under
[1:09:00] inspiration that it lives again. I trust
[1:09:04] you see yourself in them. Amen. Praise
[1:09:08] the Lord. Because if you see yourself in
[1:09:10] the in the word, you can be like
[1:09:12] Joshua. God's I'm a son of God. I have
[1:09:16] authority over over everything that
[1:09:18] stands in my
[1:09:20] way. Praise the Lord. And he being the
[1:09:22] groom, the bride is uh has to come forth
[1:09:25] because it's part of him. And it can
[1:09:26] only be the manifestation of the
[1:09:28] fulfilling of all the revelations any
[1:09:30] others have spoke of of the bride. It's
[1:09:33] only it can only manifest if it does
[1:09:35] something different from the groom. It
[1:09:37] isn't the bride because she is flesh of
[1:09:39] his flesh, bone of his bone, life of his
[1:09:41] life, word, power of his power. She is
[1:09:43] him. As man and woman are one, excuse
[1:09:45] me. And um and woman taken from his
[1:09:49] side. She uh she has taken a spirit, the
[1:09:52] feminine spirit from him, the flesh from
[1:09:54] his side, made both mechanics and
[1:09:56] dynamics. The wife, the spirit of him
[1:09:59] and the flesh of him, and put together
[1:10:00] and made mechanics and dynamics. Amen.
[1:10:04] So God is a people. You got to realize
[1:10:06] revelation will show you this is you.
[1:10:10] You're both the mechanics of the word
[1:10:11] and the dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:13] through flowing through the church.
[1:10:15] Praise the Lord. Because God has
[1:10:17] ordained that every promise of the bride
[1:10:19] will be fulfilled in this day.
[1:10:22] Amen.
[1:10:23] Praise the Lord. Now says in Ephesians
[1:10:25] 1:20, he says, "Which he which he
[1:10:28] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:10:30] from the dead." Now I'm just going to
[1:10:31] qualify how I said Joshua had dominion
[1:10:33] over all things because of revelation.
[1:10:35] Okay? When he wrought in Christ when he
[1:10:36] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:10:38] his right hand in heavenly
[1:10:40] places far above all. I like those
[1:10:43] words. That's why I put it I put it in
[1:10:45] yellow. far above all principality,
[1:10:47] power, and might, and dominion, and
[1:10:49] every name that is named, not only in
[1:10:51] this world, but also in that which is to
[1:10:53] come, and hath put all things under his
[1:10:55] feet, and gave him to be the head of um
[1:10:57] over all things, to the church, which is
[1:10:59] his body, the fullness of him that
[1:11:01] fillth all in all. Amen. So the Lord
[1:11:05] Jesus Christ has been raised far above
[1:11:07] all things. Amen. There's that means
[1:11:10] that there's so he is seated in power
[1:11:12] and authority far above everything that
[1:11:15] can be named in here or hell or in
[1:11:18] heaven far above all things. That means
[1:11:21] there's nothing can stand against him
[1:11:23] and there is nothing left that can stand
[1:11:25] against him. I mean he has conquered
[1:11:27] everything that can be conquered. Right?
[1:11:29] This is his position far above all
[1:11:32] things. He has supreme authority over
[1:11:34] all things.
[1:11:36] Now it says in Romans chapter 8 that we
[1:11:40] are joint hes with
[1:11:42] Christ. Amen. We're joint ears with
[1:11:44] Christ. Everything he fell heir to his
[1:11:47] position, his power, his authority, we
[1:11:49] have fallen air to as well. Amen. So
[1:11:52] we're equal ears with him. So if he's
[1:11:54] been seated far above all
[1:11:56] principalities, powers of might and
[1:11:58] dominion, everything that can be named,
[1:12:00] Satan, all of his works, all of the
[1:12:02] works of man, all the works of darkness,
[1:12:04] if he's been seated far above all those
[1:12:06] things, then where is the bride's
[1:12:08] position? Where he is.
[1:12:11] Amen. Where he is. Amen. You see, so
[1:12:14] revelation, revelation of who you are,
[1:12:17] being a son of God, of being part of his
[1:12:21] body. Praise God.
[1:12:23] If you know you're a son or daughter of
[1:12:25] God, you're part of his body. Amen. It's
[1:12:28] more than being part of a church. That's
[1:12:29] part of it, but that's not it. It's
[1:12:31] being part of him. He can't lose a part
[1:12:33] of himself. That's one thing he cannot
[1:12:35] do is lose part of himself. Amen. So, if
[1:12:37] he if he is far above all things and
[1:12:40] then he's put everything under under his
[1:12:42] feet, under his body, then where are we?
[1:12:45] We're above all things, too. You say,
[1:12:47] "Well, I'm insignificant. I'm I'm not a
[1:12:50] big part of the body of Christ." Listen,
[1:12:52] if you are the if you're the skin on the
[1:12:54] little toe of the foot of the body,
[1:12:56] you're still on the head of the devil.
[1:12:58] Amen. You're still above him. You still
[1:13:00] can dictate to him what he can do, what
[1:13:02] he can't do. I mean, you can still
[1:13:04] intercede on other people's behalf. Your
[1:13:06] words have more weight with God than the
[1:13:09] devil's words.
[1:13:11] Amen. We are joint ears with him. Praise
[1:13:14] the Lord. Now, it says here in uh
[1:13:17] Ephesians 1 again, it says, "Wherefore I
[1:13:19] also after I've heard of your faith in
[1:13:21] the Lord Jesus Christ, and love unto all
[1:13:23] the saints, cease not to give thanks for
[1:13:25] you, making mention of you in my
[1:13:26] prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus
[1:13:28] Christ, the Father of glory, may give
[1:13:31] unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:13:32] revelation in the knowledge of him, the
[1:13:35] eyes of your understanding, being
[1:13:37] enlightened, that you may know what is
[1:13:38] the hope of his calling, and what the
[1:13:40] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:13:42] in the saints, and what is the exceeding
[1:13:44] ing greatness of his power to us would
[1:13:46] who believe according to the working of
[1:13:48] his mighty power. Amen. So the apostle
[1:13:51] Paul is is is is praying that the that
[1:13:54] we would we would receive the spirit of
[1:13:57] wisdom and revelation. That's why
[1:13:58] brother Ram said it's very important. We
[1:14:00] could it can never be overemphasized
[1:14:02] that the eyes of your understanding
[1:14:04] would be enlightened. Now this word
[1:14:05] enlightened means that a light turns on.
[1:14:08] A light turns on. It's like turning on
[1:14:10] natural lights. Amen. Because we uh I'm
[1:14:14] sure all experienced there's a big
[1:14:15] difference uh between walking through a
[1:14:18] place where the lights are on. Look,
[1:14:20] just like the lights are on here, it's
[1:14:22] you know, it's it's bright and I say
[1:14:24] walk from here to there. You're not
[1:14:25] going to kick a chair. You're not going
[1:14:27] to fall down some steps. You're not
[1:14:29] going to bump into someone cuz you can
[1:14:30] see. Your eyes have been enlightened.
[1:14:33] But then now you turn off all the lights
[1:14:35] and it's pitch black in here and I say,
[1:14:37] "Now walk from here to there." You ain't
[1:14:39] going to walk the same way. You're not
[1:14:41] going to walk with confidence down the
[1:14:43] middle of the aisle. You're going to be
[1:14:44] real careful. Like, who's who's I'm sure
[1:14:46] we all have. Who's gone to the bathroom
[1:14:48] in the middle of the night?
[1:14:50] And now the lights are all off. So, what
[1:14:52] are you doing? You're now walking from
[1:14:54] memory. This piece of furniture is here.
[1:14:57] This is here. But you still walk
[1:14:59] carefully because no one likes to kick
[1:15:00] the corner of the bed in the middle of
[1:15:02] the night, right? But you see now, if
[1:15:04] you're if you're if the lights are off,
[1:15:06] your eyes are not enlightened. So you're
[1:15:09] walking by something you've been taught
[1:15:11] or by a memory, right? So you can't walk
[1:15:14] in the same way as if your eyes are
[1:15:15] enlightened, the lights are on and you
[1:15:17] just walk. You see, when the veil comes
[1:15:19] off our off our eyes, off our life, our
[1:15:23] eyes become enlightened. We can see.
[1:15:26] Amen. We can see. I know who you are,
[1:15:28] God. I know who I am in you. Amen. I
[1:15:31] know what the devil's doing. I know his
[1:15:33] tricks. I know when things aren't right.
[1:15:36] I can walk in this world confidently. I
[1:15:38] don't have to try and fit in with
[1:15:40] everyone. I don't have to give into peer
[1:15:42] pressure. That's ungodly peer pressure.
[1:15:44] I don't have to try and, you know, I can
[1:15:45] I can be a son of God walking through
[1:15:48] this world with confidence that God is
[1:15:50] leading me. Why? Cuz my eyes have come
[1:15:52] open. Now, you can you can try and tell
[1:15:54] someone all of the pitfalls, and we
[1:15:56] should. You know, careful where you
[1:15:58] walk, don't touch this, this will affect
[1:16:00] you badly, do this, don't do that, all
[1:16:03] those things. But if it's just dos and
[1:16:05] don'ts and it's not a revelation,
[1:16:07] they're still going to walk and bump
[1:16:08] into things. And sure, being humans, we
[1:16:11] still do bump into things, but we
[1:16:12] realize, I'm a son of God. There is a
[1:16:15] blood that's atoning for
[1:16:17] me.
[1:16:20] Amen. Praise the Lord. And
[1:16:23] we now, Brother Bram tells a
[1:16:27] story. Brother Ram tells a story of a
[1:16:29] man who was who was a soldier and he was
[1:16:32] he was uh he lost his mind. He got
[1:16:34] amnesia because of shell shock and you
[1:16:36] know in war all the bombs were going
[1:16:39] off. He lost lost his mind. He couldn't
[1:16:41] handle it anymore. And then what
[1:16:43] happened was he was going to be taken
[1:16:45] with a bunch of other soldiers on a
[1:16:47] train and they were traveling to a
[1:16:48] sanatorium which is basically a mental
[1:16:50] place you know for people who like like
[1:16:52] that who forgot who they were. They
[1:16:53] could go and live the rest of their days
[1:16:54] out. Now on his on his way now this is
[1:16:58] like many this is like many people today
[1:17:01] believers they're saved but they don't
[1:17:03] know who they are. We got to know who we
[1:17:06] are. We need that revelation of who we
[1:17:09] are because on the inside of him he knew
[1:17:12] who he you know there's a veil had come
[1:17:15] on his life because of shock and life
[1:17:17] can try and put a veil over us. We start
[1:17:19] guessing. We kind of come under pressure
[1:17:21] make irrational decisions and all these
[1:17:23] things. We forget who we can forget who
[1:17:25] we
[1:17:26] are. But that's why you don't be
[1:17:28] double-minded. Stay with the Lord. Stay
[1:17:30] with his word. And then so here he is.
[1:17:32] He's in shell shock. He's on his way to
[1:17:34] the sanatorium or however you say it.
[1:17:36] And then they stop at this they stop at
[1:17:39] a railway station on the way there. And
[1:17:41] the guards let them out and they they
[1:17:43] could, you know, walk around. They could
[1:17:44] walk around a bit. And then and then
[1:17:46] there's this there was this one one
[1:17:48] young fell that they were watching and
[1:17:50] he stopped acting like the rest of them.
[1:17:53] He began to rub his eyes. He began to
[1:17:54] look around and you know he he began to
[1:17:57] study different things and look at
[1:17:59] things like a like a water tower and
[1:18:01] things and then he started walking out
[1:18:03] of the station and he started walking
[1:18:05] down a path and now the um now one of
[1:18:08] the guards was going to stop him. But
[1:18:09] then another guard said, "No, no, let's
[1:18:11] just follow him, see where he's going to
[1:18:12] go." So what had happened now is he
[1:18:14] started to look at familiar places. See,
[1:18:16] he was veiled with this amnesia. But but
[1:18:18] as he began to look at at familiar
[1:18:20] things, this amnesia began to start
[1:18:23] lifting because he started to find his
[1:18:25] his his way back home again. And then
[1:18:28] now as he was walking, he went down a
[1:18:30] hill over another hill and then finally
[1:18:32] he came to a came to a house and then
[1:18:34] outside that house there was an old man
[1:18:36] who got up and embraced him, threw his
[1:18:38] arms around him, said, "My son, I knew
[1:18:40] you would return. They told me you were
[1:18:41] dead, but I know you would return." And
[1:18:43] the boy came back to himself. His
[1:18:45] amnesia left him. And he could identify
[1:18:47] who he was. He knowed that that was his
[1:18:49] father. So he received a revelation by
[1:18:52] his father embracing him that that who
[1:18:55] he was. It all came back to him.
[1:18:57] Remember before the foundation of the
[1:18:58] world, God thought of us a certain way.
[1:19:00] We were just a thought in his mind. Now
[1:19:02] we're expressed. But it takes the father
[1:19:05] to embrace us, his word to embrace us,
[1:19:07] for us to come back to who we really
[1:19:08] are. You see, as he was walking, seeing
[1:19:10] familiar places, what was happening was
[1:19:12] his theophony was bumping into him.
[1:19:14] Brother Ram says that heaven bumps into
[1:19:16] you all the time. You may not see it.
[1:19:18] Amen. You may not see the it in the
[1:19:21] building and see that your other world,
[1:19:23] but heaven is bumping into you. You do
[1:19:25] something wrong. What? Heaven bumps into
[1:19:27] you, convicts you to go another way and
[1:19:29] you begins to bless you with the word
[1:19:31] and open the word to you. And what's
[1:19:33] happening? That's heaven trying to get
[1:19:35] your attention that you're a son of God.
[1:19:37] That you got a theophony on the other
[1:19:39] side. And then finally, when he came to
[1:19:41] his father and embraced him, that
[1:19:42] amnesia left him. Amen. He knew who he
[1:19:45] was. That's why it's so important. Let
[1:19:47] the spirit of God impact us.
[1:19:50] Amen. Don't let a bad day impact you.
[1:19:52] Don't let your troubles impact you.
[1:19:54] Don't let the shock of whatever's going
[1:19:55] on impact you. Let the word of God
[1:19:57] impact you. That's why it's so important
[1:19:58] that we have the spirit of God move in
[1:20:00] the meetings. Amen. That's why it's so
[1:20:02] important we have camp or when you know
[1:20:03] we just let God move. Why is that? So
[1:20:05] God can reach down and touch our lives,
[1:20:08] open our hearts. Amen. That we could
[1:20:10] come to ourselves and realize who we
[1:20:13] really are. Amen. So, so before this
[1:20:16] happened to him, sure, he was going to a
[1:20:19] safe place. He was being cared for.
[1:20:21] Saying like people who are, you know,
[1:20:22] maybe they have a mental acknowledgement
[1:20:24] that they're saved. It's a good thing,
[1:20:26] but that it it it needs to go beyond
[1:20:28] that. that full amnesia could come off
[1:20:30] because when amnesia leaves then what
[1:20:32] God has placed you as a son can come
[1:20:34] into manifestation.
[1:20:38] Amen. Praise the Lord. Seems like
[1:20:41] brother Brown would say, you know, it's
[1:20:43] like a blind man who had never seen
[1:20:44] before, but he goes outside and he feels
[1:20:46] the sunlight impact him, feels the
[1:20:48] warmth of the sun, and he's never seen
[1:20:50] it before. So, he doesn't know what is
[1:20:52] even happening to him. It's like us. We
[1:20:54] can't see into that unseen realm. So, we
[1:20:56] can't see. We can feel the effects of
[1:20:58] the Holy Ghost come down and touch our
[1:21:00] lives but we don't know who's we don't
[1:21:02] grasp the magnitude I don't think of
[1:21:05] what God is really doing. That's why
[1:21:07] brother Bram was sent this is why a
[1:21:08] prophet was sent in this day that could
[1:21:10] look to the unseen world and could see
[1:21:11] the pillar of fire moving in the
[1:21:13] meetings. He said look it just fell on
[1:21:14] this one just look fell on that one
[1:21:16] touch this one. The people maybe never
[1:21:18] saw the pillar of fire but they felt the
[1:21:19] anointing come down and change their
[1:21:21] lives. Amen. But he's identifying look
[1:21:23] Christ is here. Amen. to give you
[1:21:26] revelation to to take to take the veil
[1:21:28] off your life that you know who you
[1:21:30] really are. I mean, was it heaven
[1:21:32] reaching down? Amen. It's like who you
[1:21:35] I've never I've never heard anyone say
[1:21:37] this kind of statement
[1:21:39] before. When you after you recognize the
[1:21:43] very word of God was eagle food, then
[1:21:45] you left the other thing. Okay? So,
[1:21:47] we've all left some other thing, the
[1:21:50] world or religion or just some idea. We
[1:21:53] left that cuz something in us said,
[1:21:54] "Man, this is the word of God. This
[1:21:56] message is revealing Jesus Christ in the
[1:21:59] Bible. This is special. This is this is
[1:22:01] me, right? This is the word of the day."
[1:22:03] So, we all recognize that, but we never
[1:22:05] we never really understood the magnitude
[1:22:07] of it. Look at this. You've been you
[1:22:10] have been formed into the living image
[1:22:12] of the living God. You heard from your
[1:22:14] theophony. So, it goes far deeper than
[1:22:16] man. This word touches my soul and
[1:22:18] blesses me. And I'm so happy that the
[1:22:20] mysteries have come off the book. and
[1:22:22] I'm so happy that God has restored the
[1:22:24] truth and restored my faith back. It
[1:22:26] goes deeper than that. Amen. It's why
[1:22:28] it's God telling you, "No, actually,
[1:22:29] you've heard from your theophony." Amen.
[1:22:31] That you have an eternal body already
[1:22:33] waiting in the heavens for you. Amen. If
[1:22:37] this earthly body be dissolved, you have
[1:22:39] one waiting. Praise God. So, it doesn't
[1:22:42] matter what happens, what comes, what
[1:22:43] goes. I know where I'm going. Amen.
[1:22:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:50] Revelation makes us act differently to
[1:22:51] the rest of the
[1:22:53] world. Maybe we just go back here for a
[1:22:55] second. Sorry. So, you saw familiar
[1:22:58] places. But then you look at Adam and
[1:23:00] Eve. The opposite happened to this man
[1:23:02] with amnesia. God gave them dominion
[1:23:04] over the earth. He made the he made the
[1:23:06] minor gods under under himself. He made
[1:23:09] earth their domain. Adam and Eve. Now,
[1:23:11] but when Adam forfeited the godship in
[1:23:13] order to save Eve and and and he allowed
[1:23:16] sin to rule instead. That's why, you
[1:23:18] know, people ask, why is there sickness?
[1:23:20] Why is there storms? Why is there
[1:23:21] earthquakes and horrible things going
[1:23:23] on? It's because Adam forfeited his
[1:23:26] right to be king of the earth. And Satan
[1:23:29] took his place. And now now that's why
[1:23:31] he's called the prince of the power of
[1:23:32] the air because he has he has right to
[1:23:34] to to rule that atmosphere and bring
[1:23:38] storms, bring hardship, bring sickness,
[1:23:40] pain, and sorrow and death. But you see
[1:23:43] now, so so Adam and Eve when they when
[1:23:46] they no longer had dominion, even even
[1:23:49] in themselves because they fell from
[1:23:51] that position, the very God they loved
[1:23:53] and they knew that that that he was
[1:23:55] their father, they hid from
[1:23:57] him. And he no longer Adam had no longer
[1:24:01] had dominion over nature, the earth by
[1:24:03] the spoken word. But God said he would
[1:24:06] give the promise back. So God is
[1:24:08] basically saying, I'm going to restore
[1:24:09] back man to his original position. I'm
[1:24:12] going to take the veil off them that
[1:24:14] they know who they really
[1:24:16] are. Amen. And so as I saying, I hope
[1:24:19] this is not worrisome,
[1:24:21] but as I said, revelation gives you
[1:24:24] authority. Everything stems from it.
[1:24:26] Brother Bram tells a story of a of a of
[1:24:29] a African slave in America and a slave
[1:24:32] owner comes down to comes down to buy
[1:24:35] slaves and then he and then he sees he's
[1:24:37] you know looking at the all the slaves
[1:24:39] working and the and the slave masters
[1:24:41] were whipping a whole bunch of ones but
[1:24:43] they never touched one of them and he he
[1:24:46] conducted himself
[1:24:47] differently. He conducted himself
[1:24:49] differently to the rest of the slaves
[1:24:51] and he wasn't whipped once. And this
[1:24:53] slave buyer came and he and he says he
[1:24:57] says that he wanted to buy him. So let's
[1:24:59] just read this here. One day when the
[1:25:00] slave buyer came by and he noticed how
[1:25:02] he was whipping those slaves, making
[1:25:03] them work all but one man. They didn't
[1:25:06] have to whip him. Shoulders back, chin
[1:25:07] up. He was right out um at any moment.
[1:25:10] And the broker said, "I'd like to buy
[1:25:12] that fellow." Said, "Oh," said the
[1:25:14] owner, "He's not for sale. Can't sell
[1:25:16] him." "Well," said, "I noticed you don't
[1:25:18] have to correct him." Said, "No, what's
[1:25:20] the matter? Is he the boss over them
[1:25:22] all? No, he's just a slave. Maybe you
[1:25:25] feed him different than you do the other
[1:25:26] slaves. Said, "No, they all eat in the
[1:25:28] same galley. They're just a slave."
[1:25:30] "Well, what makes him so different from
[1:25:31] the rest of them?" said, "I wondered too
[1:25:33] till I found out one day that over in
[1:25:35] the homeland where he come from Africa,
[1:25:37] his father is the king of the tribe. And
[1:25:39] though he's an alien, yet he knows he's
[1:25:41] a son of a king, and he conducts himself
[1:25:44] like one." So the revelation of who he
[1:25:46] was made him live differently to the
[1:25:49] rest of the slaves. Amen. Sure. You
[1:25:52] know, we all we all live in the same
[1:25:55] world, right? We all have the same
[1:25:58] pressures and problems as does as does
[1:26:00] everyone else, believer, unbeliever,
[1:26:03] right? But because of revelation, we are
[1:26:05] sons and daughters of God. It causes us
[1:26:07] to think differently, act differently,
[1:26:11] speak differently because of who we are.
[1:26:14] I mean, this man was an alien there in
[1:26:17] America. He he knew he's never going
[1:26:19] home back to Africa to take up his his
[1:26:21] role as king. But that did not change
[1:26:24] the fact because his identity was I'm a
[1:26:27] prince. Amen. I'm a prince. I'm not like
[1:26:30] everyone else. I'm a prince. I was born
[1:26:32] different. Amen. And by the new birth,
[1:26:35] we're born different. Amen. It reveals
[1:26:37] to us who we really are. So we go
[1:26:39] through, listen, we are aliens in this
[1:26:41] world. This world is not our home. We're
[1:26:44] just a passing through. But then why
[1:26:46] should we, you know, if we're an alien,
[1:26:48] then let's conduct ourselves as sons and
[1:26:51] daughters of God. Let's not fit in with
[1:26:53] everyone else and think the same way
[1:26:55] they are and speak the same way they do.
[1:26:57] Let us speak like sons and daughters of
[1:26:59] God. Praise the Lord. And conduct
[1:27:01] ourselves like
[1:27:02] this. Amen.
[1:27:05] Now, I just want to I just want to go
[1:27:07] into one more. I see time slipping away,
[1:27:09] but just trust you with me here. Now, we
[1:27:13] want to go to the book of Joshua
[1:27:15] again because there's one there's one
[1:27:18] person I want to speak about in
[1:27:19] particular. That's
[1:27:21] Rahab. Praise the
[1:27:24] Lord. Amen. It says here in Joshua 2:11,
[1:27:27] he says, "And as soon as they heard, as
[1:27:29] soon as we heard these things, now now
[1:27:31] Rahab is speaking to the two spies
[1:27:32] here." Wait, do I have this up? Sorry. I
[1:27:34] put it back up. You know, she's speaking
[1:27:36] to the two spies here, and she's giving
[1:27:38] the report of how the people are in
[1:27:40] Jericho
[1:27:41] now. And he says, "And as soon as we
[1:27:44] heard these things, our hearts did melt.
[1:27:46] Neither did they remain any more courage
[1:27:48] in any man because of you. For the Lord
[1:27:50] your God, he is God in heaven above and
[1:27:52] earth beneath." Now therefore, I pray
[1:27:54] you swear unto me by the Lord, since I
[1:27:56] have showed you um showed you kindness,
[1:27:58] that ye may also show kindness unto my
[1:28:01] father's house, and give me a true
[1:28:04] token. Amen. And that um ye will uh save
[1:28:07] alive my father, my mother, and my
[1:28:09] brethren, my sisters, and all that they
[1:28:11] have, and deliver our lives from death.
[1:28:13] And the men answered her, and said, "Our
[1:28:15] lives for yours, if we if you utter not
[1:28:17] this our business, and it shall be when
[1:28:18] the Lord hath given us the land that we
[1:28:20] will deal kindly and truly with thee."
[1:28:23] Then she let them down by a cord through
[1:28:25] the window, for her house was upon the
[1:28:27] town wall, and she and she uh dwelt upon
[1:28:30] the wall. And she said unto them, "Get
[1:28:33] you to the mountains, let the pursuers
[1:28:34] meet you, uh uh I mean, lest the
[1:28:36] pursuers meet you, and hide yourselves
[1:28:38] there three days until the pursuers be
[1:28:40] returned, and afterwards may you go your
[1:28:42] way." And when the men said unto her, we
[1:28:44] will be blameless of this thine oath
[1:28:47] which thou hast made us swear. And
[1:28:50] behold, when we are come into the land,
[1:28:52] thou shalt bind uh this line of scarlet
[1:28:55] thread in the window which thou dost let
[1:28:57] us down by, and thou shalt bring thy
[1:28:59] father, thy mother, and thy brethren,
[1:29:00] all thy father's household home unto
[1:29:02] thee. Amen. It says in the end there
[1:29:04] that and she bound the scarlet lion in
[1:29:07] the window. Now, Rahab, Rahab asked for
[1:29:11] a true
[1:29:12] token. I just want you to look at this
[1:29:14] now.
[1:29:16] before before the spies came to her, she
[1:29:20] was Rahab the harlot. Okay? Her life was
[1:29:23] veiled over. She didn't know who she
[1:29:25] really was. She did not know that she
[1:29:28] was to be a place of the only place of
[1:29:31] safety in a world that's falling apart
[1:29:33] or is going to fall apart. She did not
[1:29:36] know before that that in her was a was a
[1:29:40] true believer. This is like us. Now,
[1:29:43] this scarlet rope to me, it's an
[1:29:46] expression of the mercy that she's
[1:29:47] crying out for. Amen. Before, you know,
[1:29:50] it's like us, you know, there's an
[1:29:51] attribute of God laying in her that just
[1:29:54] had to come to life by hearing the word.
[1:29:56] It's the same thing with us. Brother Am
[1:29:57] says that every true believer, there's a
[1:29:59] cry in our hearts for God. There's a cry
[1:30:01] in our hearts for expression. There's a
[1:30:03] seed that's crying out to come alive and
[1:30:06] grow. And so, now here she is. Now, we
[1:30:10] didn't
[1:30:11] know that, you know, there was a cry
[1:30:14] exactly, you know, that there must be
[1:30:17] more to life. But there was just
[1:30:18] something in us that that we just
[1:30:19] weren't satisfied. Why am I trying to
[1:30:21] find satisfaction in different things,
[1:30:23] right? There was a cry. Sorry if I
[1:30:25] contradicted myself just here. Didn't
[1:30:26] mean to. I mean, but but it's the same
[1:30:28] thing in her life. Now, that true token,
[1:30:31] she already had that scarlet robe in her
[1:30:34] house. The spies did not give it to her.
[1:30:36] It was already there, but was veiled
[1:30:39] over by her first life, by her former
[1:30:42] life. Amen. It just had to come into
[1:30:45] expression. So when the veil when the
[1:30:48] veil came off of her life, when
[1:30:50] revelation came to her, amen, that there
[1:30:52] was mercy and she had received mercy,
[1:30:55] what did it do? Amnesia broke. You got
[1:30:57] to think about Jericho at this time. She
[1:30:59] just said that the hearts of
[1:31:01] everyone, our hearts have melted.
[1:31:04] Neither remain any more courage than any
[1:31:05] man because of what's going on. So this
[1:31:08] is the morale of the people of Jericho.
[1:31:10] They know they're doomed. They know the
[1:31:12] world's falling apart. They know no one
[1:31:13] has any answers. Right? So now before
[1:31:16] before this happened, she would have
[1:31:18] been under that same anointing. Right?
[1:31:21] But then when the veil came off of her
[1:31:23] life, she realized now no, I'm above
[1:31:26] this. I'm above Jericho. Amen. because I
[1:31:31] am a place of mercy now for everyone
[1:31:33] around me. Are we together? Amen. So it
[1:31:37] was a revelation that in her possession
[1:31:39] was a true token, a place of safety and
[1:31:42] salvation that gave her authority over
[1:31:45] the fear that gripped the city. Amen.
[1:31:49] This revelation caused her to overcome
[1:31:51] her past. This is why there's prevailing
[1:31:52] power in revelation. the the revelation
[1:31:55] she possessed now caused her to overcome
[1:31:57] her past her hurts and her complexes
[1:32:00] because before that, you know, she was a
[1:32:02] harlot. She would have had a world of
[1:32:03] hurt and pain and rejection just being
[1:32:05] used in little selfworth and all these
[1:32:08] things. But when she received this
[1:32:10] revelation, that veil was lifted.
[1:32:13] Amen. That veil was lifted that she was
[1:32:16] now she was possessing a place where
[1:32:18] salvation could be manifested. See, it
[1:32:21] didn't, you know, her world falling
[1:32:24] apart no longer concerned her. What was
[1:32:26] going on in the news didn't concern her.
[1:32:29] Her main concern was get her family
[1:32:31] under the token. Get her family into
[1:32:33] salvation. This was a motivating force
[1:32:36] because she realized that the mercy of
[1:32:38] God cuz God is rich in mercy. And now
[1:32:40] that mercy is actually in her. Amen. So
[1:32:43] because that mercy was in her, she
[1:32:45] allowed that to live out of her life.
[1:32:48] Amen. So the
[1:32:49] revelation that she carried gave her
[1:32:52] prevailing power, amen, over everything
[1:32:55] going on in Jericho. She was a light.
[1:32:57] She was a haven, a place that people
[1:32:59] could come and be free from the judgment
[1:33:00] that was coming. That's exactly like you
[1:33:02] and I, friends. Amen. Revelation gives
[1:33:05] us prevailing power over what's going on
[1:33:07] in the world. We don't need to fear.
[1:33:09] Amen. We should not be surprised. Let's
[1:33:11] just We should not be surprised that
[1:33:13] this trade war is going on, that the
[1:33:16] stock market's plunging because the
[1:33:18] prophet said America has to go bust. We
[1:33:20] shouldn't be surprised the gold price is
[1:33:22] going through the roof. We shouldn't be
[1:33:24] surprised. They have to go bust. I'm not
[1:33:26] saying this flippantly, but you just
[1:33:28] we're to realize the prophet said it's
[1:33:30] going to happen. We're now walking in
[1:33:32] the very manifestation of it. Look at
[1:33:35] there. I don't know. I don't know how
[1:33:36] many trillions of debt there are in
[1:33:38] America. All these things. But the
[1:33:39] prophet said it would happen. Amen. But
[1:33:42] before the world completely falls apart,
[1:33:45] what's going to happen? The bride is
[1:33:46] going to be gone.
[1:33:48] Amen. And what is really what really you
[1:33:51] know you know to us we think well
[1:33:53] actually the time frame of uh you know u
[1:33:57] Jericho falling was the fact that you
[1:33:59] know Israel would march around a certain
[1:34:01] way and it was but really what was God
[1:34:04] waiting for? For Rahab to get her family
[1:34:06] in. His main focus was actually that
[1:34:10] salvation being manifested in her house.
[1:34:12] Just like now the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:34:14] is God's main focus. Amen. You are his
[1:34:17] main focus. We're never out of his care.
[1:34:19] All that is really just the backdrop.
[1:34:22] Amen. So we can so so if we realize
[1:34:26] Lord we are I am your main focus Lord.
[1:34:29] We can rest in him and let him live
[1:34:31] through our lives. Don't get all tense
[1:34:32] and worried and doubleminded. What's
[1:34:34] going on? Does the word work? Does it
[1:34:36] not work? what's happening. We say,
[1:34:37] "Lord, your word is working. Lord, I
[1:34:39] trust you. Lord, you've given me a
[1:34:41] revelation. I'm your child."
[1:34:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. See, when when
[1:34:47] the two spies when the two spies spoke
[1:34:50] to her, they did not lay out the dos and
[1:34:53] don'ts of being a good church member,
[1:34:55] they didn't see all, you know, they did
[1:34:57] not give her a cood book, which is fine,
[1:34:58] and instruct her how to behave in church
[1:35:00] and how to be a good church member.
[1:35:02] That's all perfectly well, but that is
[1:35:04] not taking the veil off telling people
[1:35:05] how to behave in church. No, the veil
[1:35:07] comes off when the anointed word is
[1:35:09] preached and what is within them comes
[1:35:11] out. I mean because because her first
[1:35:14] question hearing of all the destruction
[1:35:16] coming is there must be a place of
[1:35:17] safety. There must be mercy in mixed
[1:35:20] with judgment somewhere because it was
[1:35:22] an attribute of God that was actually in
[1:35:23] her that needed to come to expression.
[1:35:28] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:35:32] When the veil comes off, we can impart
[1:35:34] eternal life. This is the greater works.
[1:35:37] I I'm going to be closing in just a
[1:35:40] couple of things. Says, notice the
[1:35:41] greater works was to have power in the
[1:35:43] church, not only to heal the sick by
[1:35:45] prayer, cast out the devils by prayer,
[1:35:46] but to impart eternal life to believers.
[1:35:49] The Holy Ghost was coming and given into
[1:35:51] the hands of the church to impart life.
[1:35:53] Oh, that's what Calvary meant. It took
[1:35:55] stoop, degraded men and women and lifted
[1:35:57] them into a place to be sons and
[1:35:58] daughters of God to heal the sick and to
[1:36:00] impart eternal life to give the Holy
[1:36:02] Ghost to obedient believers. Men who
[1:36:05] were once unbelievers made believers and
[1:36:07] impart spiritual eternal life. I mean
[1:36:10] when the veil came off Peter's life,
[1:36:11] what did he do? Imparted eternal life.
[1:36:13] Lay hands upon people. They received the
[1:36:15] Holy Ghost. Preached the word to
[1:36:16] Cornelius and his house was yet
[1:36:18] preaching the word. The Holy Ghost fell
[1:36:20] upon them. What happened through the
[1:36:21] preaching the word? eternal life was
[1:36:23] imparted. Amen. That's how much greater
[1:36:26] it is to say p pardon. How much greater
[1:36:29] is it to say this sick woman laying here
[1:36:31] I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll
[1:36:33] be healed. That's a great thing. But uh
[1:36:35] that's what he was going to do then. But
[1:36:37] said greater than this shall you do. I'm
[1:36:39] going to give you power not only to
[1:36:40] raise him up for a while but to give me
[1:36:42] eternal life which will be eternal
[1:36:44] forever. He says oh poor blind wretched
[1:36:46] people how do you miss that? Don't you
[1:36:48] see what the greater thing is? That's
[1:36:50] the greatest thing could ever happen was
[1:36:51] to impart eternal life to people. What
[1:36:53] is eternal life? The life that he lived,
[1:36:55] the life that was in him, impart that to
[1:36:57] others. Can a man do it? A son of God
[1:37:01] can by preaching, by prayer. Amen. We
[1:37:06] all have a part in this. God can use you
[1:37:08] to pray for someone. They receive the
[1:37:09] Holy Ghost. Amen. You create an
[1:37:12] atmosphere in your home where they they
[1:37:14] they come under the influence of the
[1:37:16] Holy Ghost in you. Amen. all these all
[1:37:20] these things. But where does that come
[1:37:22] from? We got to realize it all comes
[1:37:23] from revelation. I'm just going to
[1:37:25] close. You say, "Well, well, when will
[1:37:27] we be these sons of God?" Now we are the
[1:37:29] sons of God. Now we are the sons of God.
[1:37:33] So what does the message come to do? To
[1:37:35] reveal Jesus Christ in his word and to
[1:37:38] you. And what does that do? That reveals
[1:37:41] who you are. Amen. And that revelation
[1:37:44] that he puts in you is just showing you
[1:37:45] what you already are, right? And it
[1:37:48] gives you overcoming power in every
[1:37:51] circumstance. Right? So this is my
[1:37:53] summary now. So if you're going through
[1:37:55] trouble, pray for revelation. If you
[1:37:57] don't know who you are in the word, pray
[1:37:59] for revelation. Amen. If you, you know,
[1:38:02] if you if you need joy, pray for
