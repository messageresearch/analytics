[19:25] we're going to have a second testimony
[19:29] service so there are any testimonies you
[19:32] can come up
[19:44] foreign
[19:50] but I I really want to share this and
[19:53] this is actually Daniel's little
[19:55] testimony so the last day of camp the
[19:58] right at the end there um there came a
[20:01] guy in with a motorbike and um the
[20:04] little man as he is he climbed on onto
[20:07] the motorbike but he stepped with his
[20:09] foot on the exhaust and it burned his
[20:12] foot underneath and he was quite Brave
[20:15] about it and I eventually got into it I
[20:19] was looking for him and he was in the
[20:20] kitchen and he just he was crying he was
[20:23] he's so sore so we put it under water
[20:26] and um
[20:27] he I prayed for him I said ask him if I
[20:30] can pray for him so and then we put on
[20:33] some aloe vera and um went to the hall
[20:36] helped the men just finish up with the
[20:38] packing and about half an hour later he
[20:40] started really crying and he was just
[20:43] complaining about how so
[20:45] his foot is and he
[20:49] we've I've put more aloe vera on and um
[20:52] just tried to calm him down and we went
[20:55] home we went to this rivers and he was I
[20:58] said to him okay so you need to stay off
[21:01] your foot now you can't play you can't
[21:02] jump you can't run you just need to and
[21:06] it was good for a little while doing
[21:07] that and later on he came to me said
[21:10] okay he said I believe it's not going to
[21:12] be sore anymore so I'm gonna go play I
[21:16] said okay I said Do you believe it's not
[21:18] going to be so he said yep I believe
[21:20] it's not gonna be so anymore I'm gonna
[21:22] go blind okay you believe I'm not gonna
[21:24] stand in your way praise the Lord he
[21:26] didn't cry no more there was nothing the
[21:28] food healed very very nicely so um yeah
[21:32] amen praise the Lord
[21:34] [Applause]
[21:51] um my testimony is still ongoing um but
[21:55] um the week a few days before Camp I
[21:58] drove all the way up to Tauranga for a
[22:00] jury service and
[22:02] um my cat kind of had a few issues then
[22:06] um and but I wasn't too concerned and
[22:09] then
[22:10] um left on Friday from Tauranga six hour
[22:14] drive
[22:15] um left at eight o'clock I think it was
[22:16] and to drive to camp and I was an hour
[22:20] away from otaki and the temperature
[22:23] gauge I'm like I keep climbing and
[22:25] climbing and
[22:27] um I was like to Stella my sister I was
[22:30] like can pray for my car please because
[22:32] I'm not stopping and so I keep blasting
[22:35] the heater
[22:36] um and got to Camp
[22:39] um okay and then come Monday tried to
[22:42] start it and there were quite a few
[22:45] issues that didn't want to start then
[22:49] um but the brothers helped me and um we
[22:52] got it going and um I got to brother
[22:56] adaman's okay and then I was able to
[23:00] leave and I got back home so in total my
[23:04] car had driven
[23:05] about eight hours and it I took it into
[23:09] the mechanics the next day and he said
[23:12] it's completely shot like take it to the
[23:14] Wreckers so
[23:17] um and I picked it up and he said are
[23:20] you going very far with it and I was
[23:22] like No just around the corner and he's
[23:23] like good it's she's not gonna make it
[23:26] far so I was so grateful to the Lord
[23:28] that I made it all the way from Tauranga
[23:30] to Camp because I didn't want to miss it
[23:33] for a silly materialistic car so I was
[23:37] so grateful to the Lord and I know that
[23:39] everything's ordered and everything is
[23:41] so timely so I'm so grateful
[23:44] [Applause]
[23:56] God bless you all I'm not really the
[23:59] type of person to come up but I just
[24:01] wanted to um justify what the Lord did
[24:04] for me
[24:05] um
[24:06] okay so in the past camps have always
[24:09] been such a blessing to me but
[24:12] um I just noticed that in my heart
[24:14] there'll be like not a big change in it
[24:17] so I'll just keep going back into the
[24:19] world and all its influences and
[24:22] it'll just be it's like the Lord just
[24:25] telling me if it's fully surrendered
[24:27] everything to um
[24:28] him yet and
[24:31] when I went to Camp I was just praying
[24:33] for such a personal experience with the
[24:35] Lord because that's what I wanted and um
[24:39] on Saturday night
[24:41] um
[24:41] fear was spoken and I was so amazed
[24:44] because
[24:46] there was something that I needed like I
[24:48] didn't even realize how much fear had
[24:50] overtaken my life and everything
[24:54] and um it was so eye-opening to me
[24:57] and um
[25:01] that's when I realized that how much
[25:03] fear had just been controlling my life
[25:06] and I didn't even realize it myself
[25:09] um
[25:10] and then on Sunday
[25:12] night I actually went up to the altar
[25:16] um
[25:18] it was after the service and the song
[25:21] service actually
[25:24] and
[25:25] I just went up there and out there and I
[25:28] was just crying and just wanting to give
[25:30] everything to him because I was done
[25:32] with
[25:35] this like trying to trust in my own will
[25:38] and
[25:40] everything and um
[25:42] I went up there and it was so amazing
[25:44] because so many brothers and sisters
[25:45] were praying for me and I knew that was
[25:48] the Lord
[25:49] and what was amazing was I believe it
[25:52] was the Lord um
[25:55] those actually uh
[25:57] tongues and interpretation and I think I
[26:00] believe that was the Lord speaking to me
[26:02] but just then like the spirit of the
[26:04] Lord just came with my life and I just
[26:07] I couldn't deny that wasn't the Lord
[26:08] because it really was
[26:10] and um
[26:12] I'm so thankful but out of the tongue's
[26:15] interpretation what I got was
[26:18] that the Lord was telling me that
[26:21] he has never left me and he will never
[26:24] leave me even in my lowest and darkest
[26:27] moments of my life
[26:28] and to have no fear and so
[26:32] that was just so amazing and
[26:35] it was like I wasn't myself anymore and
[26:38] um
[26:39] and then on
[26:41] Monday every girl was spoken and I was
[26:44] just so thankful because
[26:47] when the Lord slew Every Girl's old
[26:49] husband I could just it was so personal
[26:51] to me because it was like my old life is
[26:53] all gone
[26:55] yeah I just want to praise the Lord and
[26:57] God bless you
[26:58] [Applause]
[27:14] okay
[27:25] God bless everyone
[27:28] um I just thought I'll give a little
[27:29] testimony of
[27:31] um what happened to me at Camp as well
[27:34] um a few weeks leading up to campus was
[27:37] really busy trying to get everything
[27:39] sorted out and
[27:41] um
[27:43] the Wednesday before the Tuesday before
[27:46] Camp I was in a lot of pain and I've
[27:48] been really struggling with my feet for
[27:50] for a very long time and I have this
[27:54] constant pain on the exact same spot on
[27:58] the outside of my foot but on on both my
[28:01] feet on the exact same spot
[28:04] um and for years I thought it was the
[28:05] Orthotics that I was wearing and I've
[28:07] gone to podiatrists and stuff like that
[28:09] so
[28:10] um on the Tuesday I rang up Sister
[28:13] Barbara and I was and I said to her
[28:15] really can you do something for me
[28:17] because I've got
[28:18] a few busy days ahead with camping I
[28:20] really can't afford this pain any longer
[28:22] and I'm just in agony so
[28:26] um she got me to come in and she
[28:29] strapped my foot because
[28:31] um because of the condition of my food
[28:33] she said that she has to strap it so
[28:37] there is limited movement with my feet
[28:39] and I've got to stay off my feet for
[28:42] three days and I said well that's
[28:43] impossible because we've got camp and
[28:46] we've got the hole to set up and and
[28:48] there's just no way that I'm
[28:50] well if anybody knows me they know that
[28:52] I'll never sit down for three days
[28:54] with my feet up and do nothing but
[28:56] anyway
[28:58] um
[28:59] so I
[29:01] um had that done in the morning and
[29:04] um that night she said to me I'm not
[29:08] allowed to get away to anything like
[29:09] that it's got to stay totally dry for
[29:11] three days and I was how am I meant to
[29:13] shouting how am I meant to do anything
[29:14] and just now I just it's got to stay dry
[29:18] so anyway that night I accidentally got
[29:21] away tonight got so frustrated with the
[29:24] pain that I just ripped it all up and I
[29:26] was like I'm just just done with this
[29:28] and then the pain just got worse
[29:31] and um the Thursday and Friday I was
[29:35] I was in a lot of pain and I wasn't
[29:37] taking a lot of
[29:39] um medication and I and then I started
[29:42] to get the headaches which was
[29:43] so I had the headaches it was that I was
[29:46] taking pills for and then my feet was
[29:48] throbbing and I was just not in a in a
[29:50] good place but anyway
[29:53] um the Friday night
[29:55] after
[29:57] um the first message that brother Chris
[29:59] preached and I was sitting there
[30:00] thinking
[30:01] why am I accepting this and so I went up
[30:05] for prayer and um and I said to brother
[30:09] Chris you know this is this is what's
[30:10] going on with me and before he started
[30:14] to pray he said sister it's finished
[30:16] it's done
[30:18] and then he prayed and
[30:21] and I was thankful for that and
[30:24] it wasn't a miracle it wasn't the pain
[30:26] and gone the pain was still there and I
[30:28] was I was like okay Lord I've gone off a
[30:30] prayer and
[30:32] and and I believe that that I'm not
[30:34] healed and the pain would go
[30:37] and the next morning I woke up and the
[30:39] pain was gone there was literally no
[30:41] pain there was just no pain and so I was
[30:44] walking around the Saturday and there
[30:46] was no pain and I wasn't thinking about
[30:48] it when I sat down I felt pain again and
[30:51] I was like oh my face my feet are so
[30:52] sore and the minute I said that the pain
[30:55] just came back and I've realized that
[30:57] every time I've said that the pain comes
[30:59] back
[31:00] and so I was talking to Christine about
[31:02] it and I said I don't know what to do I
[31:04] keep every time I walk and I feel the
[31:06] pain and I think okay the Pain's then
[31:09] the pain just comes back all the time
[31:10] and she said you gotta just believe and
[31:12] just say every time you feel that just
[31:15] sit down and say thank you Lord for my
[31:16] healing and since then I've done that
[31:19] and I've had no Pace I'm so thankful for
[31:23] that and I've just
[31:24] um I'm sure my family is gonna love that
[31:26] because they constantly are they
[31:29] constantly
[31:30] have to massage my feet because my feet
[31:33] so sore but I haven't had to ask them to
[31:35] do that so I just
[31:38] so I just want to say thank you to the
[31:40] Lord for that it's really answered
[31:41] prayer
[31:43] [Applause]
[31:55] um so on Sunday brother Ben preached
[31:58] that um you gotta get the devil out of
[32:00] the house of your heart and you've got
[32:02] to clean it out and just let the Holy
[32:05] Ghost come in because otherwise the
[32:06] devil's gonna come and come back in
[32:08] again and actually it turns out that's
[32:10] what I prayed when I was at the front I
[32:13] prayed that the Lord would clean out my
[32:14] heart and get the devil out and come
[32:16] into my heart and the devil wouldn't
[32:18] come back in again and I believe that
[32:20] he's doing that
[32:26] I know
[32:34] there any others
[32:38] okay I have my own testimony
[32:42] so um last week Wednesday I was in
[32:47] English just at normal school day and I
[32:50] was just wearing my headphones just
[32:51] listening to music and then I had my
[32:54] next period and then I had lunch and as
[32:56] I sat down at lunch I saw my zip my bag
[32:59] zip was open
[33:00] and I was like oh okay it's just closed
[33:03] and then when I closed I realized that's
[33:05] where my headphones I put them so when I
[33:07] zipped the back open my headphones were
[33:08] gone I was like okay so I went to all my
[33:10] friends asked them hey are you pulling
[33:12] any pranks it's not funny anymore and
[33:14] they're like no no we're not so they're
[33:15] all packed out their bags although I
[33:17] didn't ask them
[33:19] um and uh they're like oh it's not here
[33:21] it's like okay
[33:22] so uh I went afterwards my friend
[33:24] Lachlan and me we all went and just
[33:28] we went and just had a lock all around
[33:30] and asked everyone and went to the
[33:32] office and there was nothing so for the
[33:35] few days after that I just well every
[33:37] day I just kept going back to the office
[33:38] asking hey is it come back here to sit
[33:40] there and like no and I started praying
[33:43] and that the afternoon I lost I was also
[33:46] praying that it would come back and then
[33:49] um
[33:50] and it was a dinnerless camp
[33:52] I think
[33:54] no it wasn't and then
[33:57] um
[33:58] so then Monday night we had the with the
[34:01] youth had the the prayer service the
[34:03] prayer night and
[34:05] while it all Halloween and everyone was
[34:07] going around we didn't get any knocks so
[34:09] that was pretty good that because they
[34:11] would have met the Holy Ghost instead of
[34:13] the other ghosts but um
[34:15] so then I put I put that up for prayer
[34:18] and then there so then that night Ben
[34:20] Ben Bailey he prayed and he said that
[34:22] whoever wears the headphones will feel
[34:24] convicted and that they'll know that
[34:26] it's been used for something more than
[34:27] they could and they can imagine and that
[34:29] it's been used for the glory of God and
[34:31] I was like amen and I believed it and
[34:33] then Tuesday we we were um so yesterday
[34:36] we were with the the Milam's and the
[34:40] maritzas and we had gone to wairarapa
[34:42] and showed them around and then this
[34:44] morning I went to I went to school and I
[34:46] was actually pretty upset because I was
[34:47] like I want to go with the others and go
[34:49] to Wellington and I was all mad and then
[34:52] I was just having and then I was just
[34:55] the grumpy guy at school and then it
[34:58] came after my interval morning tea I sat
[35:01] down in my form class and my friend
[35:03] comes up to me and he says oh I got
[35:06] something for you she walks up to the
[35:07] front and goes under the teacher's desk
[35:09] and he pulls out my headphones I was
[35:10] like oh so where do you find that and he
[35:13] goes I don't know if the it was just
[35:14] sitting there yesterday morning or just
[35:16] sitting on the desk I was like oh okay
[35:17] so I asked the teacher where she found
[35:19] it and she says no before I had any
[35:20] classes I walked in and your headphones
[35:22] were sitting there so and that was the
[35:24] morning after the our prayers our prayer
[35:27] night and she says no classes came in so
[35:30] you must have just left it then I was
[35:31] like but I didn't leave it here I used
[35:34] it after my film class so class after

[43:19] in your life just really appreciate your
[43:22] friendship brother amen how many years
[43:24] excited about the word tonight
[43:26] well this evening will be just a little
[43:28] bit different I want to speak a little
[43:30] bit in on the lines of of more of a
[43:32] reflection we just look at some of the
[43:35] events that have taken place and just
[43:36] reflect a little bit tonight you know
[43:39] and I think it's good after camp that we
[43:41] we look ahead now let's look ahead and
[43:42] see what the Lord's doing for us and
[43:44] then let's keep pressing the battle I'm
[43:46] so thankful for what God did at Camp
[43:48] amen and we're rejoicing in those
[43:50] wonderful things God is faithful amen
[43:52] and I enjoyed those testimonies tonight
[43:54] amen may the Lord continue and finish
[43:56] the work amen let there be a performance
[43:58] of the things that he has spoken amen
[44:00] and this evening we want to look at this
[44:02] uh if we can title it this evening the
[44:04] queen of the oath the queen of the oath
[44:07] and we'll have some slides for you this
[44:08] evening
[44:09] and as you can see on the slides there
[44:11] there's the Buckingham Palace and
[44:13] there's great statues there in front of
[44:15] it but if you notice there's there's two
[44:17] rainbows going over the palace there and
[44:19] this is right at the time of Queen
[44:21] Elizabeth II passing away and yeah and
[44:24] right at that time as as they were
[44:26] announcing these things and it was
[44:27] becoming world news there was these two
[44:30] big rainbows and I and I thought when I
[44:32] saw that I thought of the the Covenant
[44:34] that we are under which is Grace Grace
[44:36] amen we're under an oath we're under a
[44:39] covenant as the bride of Christ we're
[44:40] the queen amen you know in the world was
[44:43] so affected by that Queen's passing and
[44:46] I wonder man what's what's it going to
[44:48] be like when the when the world realizes
[44:50] the queen of God who she is amen and so
[44:53] this evening it'll be just a little bit
[44:54] of a reflection to look at some of the
[44:56] events and see you know I because I
[44:58] personally believe and you'll find that
[45:00] I'm maybe a peculiar this way but I
[45:02] believe that when things happen
[45:03] especially on that scale God is trying
[45:06] to tell us something you know he's
[45:07] trying to point out this that the
[45:09] certain event that means something not
[45:11] just for the world but for you amen
[45:13] because they're parallels you know as
[45:14] there's Queen out there there's the
[45:16] queen of God also and so we just want to
[45:18] look at this and I trust will encourage
[45:20] you this evening if you'll turn with me
[45:22] in your Bibles to the Book of Matthew
[45:24] 12 and 38
[45:27] Matthew 12 and 38.
[45:33] amen
[45:35] you know we're we're so thankful that we
[45:37] have eyes to see you know the world is
[45:40] just taking one day at a time and and
[45:42] trying to survive and trying to cope and
[45:44] trying to figure out what the next step
[45:46] is and how to keep the economies going
[45:48] and you know it's like Ahab and his
[45:49] Chariot you know he's bleeding out he's
[45:51] dead but you know they propped him up in
[45:53] that part that poor guy they propped
[45:56] them up in that Chariot and they try to
[45:57] you know keep the you know they're
[45:58] trying to keep the soldiers fighting
[46:00] trying to keep them inspired but you
[46:02] know all you have to do is take a good
[46:03] look at Ahab and say man he's not
[46:05] himself you know that leader is he's not
[46:07] acting right you know something's off
[46:09] with Ahab you know he's bleeding out in
[46:11] his Chariot and that's like the
[46:12] economies of the world the world's
[46:14] falling apart again and again and again
[46:16] you know my brother and sister and it's
[46:17] and it's exciting for us because you
[46:19] know we look at these things and and we
[46:21] see it with different eyes we we say wow
[46:24] isn't this what the what the prophet
[46:26] spoke about isn't this what the
[46:27] scriptures told us would happen amen so
[46:30] let's lean a little bit from the word
[46:31] like that tonight amen Matthew 12 and 38
[46:35] it reads like this then certain of the
[46:37] scribes and of the Pharisees answered
[46:39] saying Master we would see a sign from
[46:42] thee
[46:43] 39 says but he answered and said unto
[46:45] them an evil and adulterous generation
[46:47] seeketh after a sign and there shall be
[46:49] no sign given to it but the sign of the
[46:52] Prophet Jonas so you'll notice right
[46:55] away that God is very careful to make
[46:57] sure that he leaves signs or memorials
[46:59] for the people to when they come to a
[47:01] certain Junction in time they'll
[47:03] remember hey what about this and what
[47:05] about that scripture wasn't Elias
[47:06] supposed to come first right
[47:09] in verse 40 says and for us Jonas was
[47:12] three days and three nights in the
[47:13] whale's barely so shall the son of man
[47:15] three days and three nights in the heart
[47:17] of the Earth
[47:18] in verse 41 and the men of Nineveh shall
[47:21] rise in judgment with this generation
[47:23] and shall condemn it because they
[47:25] repented
[47:26] at the preaching of Jonas and behold the
[47:29] greater than Jonas is here now notice
[47:32] verse 42
[47:34] the queen of the South shall rise in the
[47:37] Judgment with this generation and shall
[47:39] condemn it for she came from the
[47:41] outermost parts of the earth to hear the
[47:43] wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater
[47:46] than Solomon is here amen barrage one
[47:49] more time gracious Heavenly Father we
[47:51] bow before you Lord humbly this evening
[47:53] looking To You O God recognizing the
[47:55] events taking a place around us we see
[47:58] Russia we see the Ukraine we see the
[48:00] Vatican we see the World Council of
[48:02] churches and we see this queen that has
[48:04] passed away just recently Lord and we
[48:06] recognize oh God you're doing something
[48:08] Lord Lord you're on the move oh God
[48:11] nothing happens by mistake or by
[48:13] accident oh God but that you allow it
[48:15] Lord and it's supposed to inspire us
[48:17] we're supposed to look up Lord because
[48:18] our Redemption draws nigh we see
[48:21] pestilences we see wars and rumors of
[48:23] wars Lord let us be encouraged tonight
[48:25] Lord that this you're not a dead God but
[48:27] Lord that you're on the Move Lord You're
[48:29] a living God lord and even the whole
[48:31] world Lord is governed by a word Lord
[48:34] and nothing happens and nothing escapes
[48:36] your word Lord but Lord your word and
[48:38] your thoughts dictate the events and the
[48:41] times and you're behind every move that
[48:43] happens out there so Lord we're excited
[48:45] tonight Lord let us just be encouraged a
[48:48] little in your word this evening let us
[48:49] find strength in your word tonight Jesus
[48:52] Christ's name amen you may have receipts
[48:55] amen try not to get too excited I want
[48:57] to just kind of go through this a little
[48:59] methodically this evening and just kind
[49:01] of leave you something to think about if
[49:02] that's all right with you I want to give
[49:04] you just something to think about so
[49:05] when we leave we go back to Canada you
[49:07] know just think about some of these
[49:09] things and Ponder them amen what time
[49:11] are we living in what what generation
[49:13] are we in you know what are some of
[49:14] these events that are taking place you
[49:16] know it's they're not for they're not to
[49:18] cause us fear these events are not the
[49:19] cause of fear or worry you know for the
[49:22] world it causes great fearing anxiety in
[49:25] these things but for us it gives us
[49:26] Direction I mean it tells us where we're
[49:28] living what position we're in and what
[49:31] timing is is is taking place amen so we
[49:34] see that that God has gone Witnesses
[49:36] from every generation you know one day
[49:39] listen let's not mistake this this is
[49:41] very important this this is absolutely
[49:43] critical because and at Judgment Day on
[49:46] that day God is going to have witnesses
[49:48] stand up and and attest to these things
[49:51] that God's word is true amen
[49:54] and he says you're the queen of the
[49:56] South shall rise up in the Judgment with
[49:59] this generation with this generation oh
[50:02] my can you imagine that Queen rising up
[50:05] in that day with that generation with
[50:07] her people and that that people that was
[50:09] alive at that time and we'll be able to
[50:11] say Solomon was right
[50:13] Solomon was right everything Solomon
[50:15] said by the word of God through his
[50:17] wisdom was right all the discernments
[50:20] all the prophecies everything he
[50:22] declared unto us was right
[50:24] and he says a greater than Solomon is
[50:27] here and that scripture is true tonight
[50:29] that there is a greater than Solomon the
[50:31] wisest man of all time amen truly
[50:34] inspired by God Godly given wisdom and
[50:36] man that had the gift of wisdom amen and
[50:39] to think that a greater than Solomon is
[50:41] here
[50:42] Exodus 4 and 8. let's move forward here
[50:45] a little bit
[50:46] and it shall come to pass if they will
[50:48] not believe thee neither hearken to the
[50:51] voice of the first sign that they will
[50:52] believe the voice of the latter sign
[50:54] look at God's grace how that how did God
[50:56] bring signs and wonders and he knows how
[50:59] to attract the attention of the people
[51:01] great Pentecostal movements and
[51:03] outpourings of the Holy Spirit God
[51:05] pouring out his love and trying to do
[51:08] what trying to attract the people trying
[51:10] to show them I'm moving something's
[51:12] happening amen these Miracles and all
[51:15] these things they're not just for for
[51:16] bragging rights and for niceties and
[51:18] just to help us cope a little bit in
[51:20] life God uses them for a reason for a
[51:23] purpose and we see how he did that in
[51:25] the great Exodus Moses on the scene and
[51:27] and the great plagues that took place in
[51:29] the the death angel that came through
[51:31] the land and and then all the signs
[51:33] following thereafter and and God was
[51:35] doing all that to prove his presence
[51:37] with his people
[51:38] amen and he's saying even how that if
[51:42] they will not believe the first signs
[51:43] he's going to bring more signs you know
[51:46] God is faithful God is gracious that way
[51:49] verse 9 says and it shall come to pass
[51:51] if they will not believe these two signs
[51:54] neither hearken to thy voice
[51:57] that thou shall take of the water of the
[51:59] river and pour it out upon the dry land
[52:01] in the water which thou take us out of
[52:03] the river shall become blood upon the
[52:05] dry land we see how God just continues
[52:07] to give signs and wonders and be
[52:09] gracious and I believe that we are
[52:11] living in a time of great grace
[52:13] amen we think of how Israel you know
[52:16] with those paratroopers went up that
[52:18] hill on the on the on that mountain they
[52:20] put that flag of Israel the sixth
[52:22] pointed star of David on that in that
[52:24] Temple Mount amen that's a great moment
[52:27] because the prophet said when you see
[52:28] that flag the six-pointed flag flying
[52:30] over Jerusalem he says it's over
[52:33] and nearly these paratroopers in 1948
[52:35] take that flag and they and they they
[52:37] put it on there and and what happened
[52:39] the government tells them hey take the
[52:41] flag down take the flag down right
[52:44] because why because we weren't here yet
[52:46] we weren't here yet we still had to be
[52:49] saved we still have to come in so we see
[52:51] we live under a great oath we're the
[52:53] queen of the oath or the Covenant God is
[52:55] is showing his great grace towards us
[52:59] amen oh my
[53:01] God Amen Prophet says this in the
[53:04] message the Rapture 1965 right before
[53:06] he's closing uh his his ministry he says
[53:10] I do believe that we are living in the
[53:11] closing scenes of the history of this
[53:14] world I truly believe that the coming of
[53:16] the Lord is closer perhaps than we think
[53:19] 1965. where are we sitting tonight
[53:22] hey man do you feel the change in the
[53:24] seasons the change in the weather is
[53:26] just a little bit different out there
[53:27] people have changed you know governments
[53:30] have changed their Direction you know
[53:31] things have become really weird we saw
[53:32] something through covet we thought was
[53:34] never possible how did they control the
[53:36] whole world
[53:37] overnight the whole world was under
[53:39] subjection to their rulings
[53:42] so we see Seasons seasons are changing
[53:44] and and we see governments changing all
[53:46] kinds of things are changing and then on
[53:48] top of all this Queen Elizabeth passes
[53:51] away Queen Elizabeth II you know it's
[53:53] like the the second Eve you know all
[53:55] these things it's just perfect you see
[53:56] as we go through the the this event how
[53:59] how perfect the parallels are
[54:02] you'll have to forgive me because this
[54:04] is how my mind works you know I see I
[54:06] see God in types and shadows and events
[54:08] and and you know it just gives it gives
[54:10] encouragement and when we see those
[54:11] things we see the parallels in the
[54:13] scriptures amen
[54:15] now the important thing to remember is
[54:17] her name is Queen Elizabeth Her Majesty
[54:19] Queen Elizabeth II
[54:22] you know I heard this news when I was
[54:23] driving down the road and and just
[54:25] delivering some prints for for our
[54:27] church and and I know and and as news
[54:29] came on that Queen Elizabeth has passed
[54:32] away
[54:33] and the thing that really caught my
[54:35] attention they kept saying this over and
[54:36] over and I thought it was amazing this
[54:38] is the world saying this they're saying
[54:40] this is the end of an era
[54:44] just let that sink in for a moment this
[54:46] is the end of an era
[54:48] now the world it's just you know nobody
[54:51] ever really thought about her you know
[54:53] it's just kind of this Monarch and and
[54:55] she people don't really pay a whole lot
[54:56] of attention you know we we realize her
[54:58] position and we give respects to those
[55:00] things you know us being a Canadian you
[55:02] know we're still kind of under that
[55:04] Commonwealth and here in New Zealand
[55:05] you're under the same kind of
[55:07] Commonwealth you know so we're all
[55:08] attached to this queen we're all
[55:10] connected to this queen somehow you know
[55:11] but look at how the whole world stopped
[55:14] on the day when she passed away and
[55:16] acknowledged that we're at the end of an
[55:18] era how are we at the end of an era with
[55:21] a passing away of Queen Elizabeth
[55:24] why is the world saying that and
[55:26] everywhere you you look this was a great
[55:28] event everyone was distressed and and
[55:31] saddened and people started gathering
[55:33] around the palace and they want to know
[55:35] where is she where's her body and and
[55:37] what's taking place what's the very next
[55:39] step and and people acknowledging that
[55:41] something great has happened something
[55:43] sad something we're losing someone
[55:48] what is God trying to show us huh it's
[55:51] the end of an era and I started to
[55:53] wonder what does this all mean it it got
[55:55] my attention you know we I started
[55:57] thinking about this queen and you know
[55:58] she was a queen that was known for
[56:00] dressing modestly
[56:02] huh just think about this for a moment
[56:04] she was known for that and and I'm just
[56:06] saying what what the world is saying
[56:08] amen these are the things they started
[56:10] to remember her by they remember her as
[56:12] being someone who always dressed for her
[56:14] role in other words she was royalty she
[56:17] was the queen right but she also dressed
[56:19] her part yeah yeah right they they
[56:22] acknowledged that they saw that she
[56:23] dressed differently from everybody right
[56:26] but this is the end of this era
[56:28] interesting
[56:30] she represented modesty she remained she
[56:33] she represented a signified an error
[56:36] that is passing away
[56:38] that's right someone who was devoted to
[56:40] her cause regardless of the critics
[56:44] not as many things we could say about
[56:46] Elizabeth tonight but I know some of you
[56:48] have probably done some research on her
[56:49] and regardless of the trials and
[56:52] challenges that she faced people were
[56:54] saying that she stood the test of time
[56:57] and we're not talking for your rule
[56:59] right like our politicians no no this is
[57:02] a long time 70 years
[57:06] 70 years my brothers and sisters that is
[57:10] a long time to be a monarch okay and
[57:13] hold that kind of a testimony to uphold
[57:16] it to be able to say that she stood the
[57:18] test of time
[57:20] think about what God is doing with his
[57:22] Queen
[57:23] and there's going to be queens that are
[57:25] going to stand there on that day they're
[57:27] going to say his word was true I I was
[57:30] happy to stand for him amen
[57:33] and think of this queen of the South
[57:35] she came from the uttermost parts of the
[57:37] world to see who the Solomon is
[57:40] I just love these testimonies love you
[57:44] Boris Johnson prime minister Boris
[57:46] Johnson I believe I think is ex-prime
[57:48] Minister Boris Johnson now
[57:50] he's he he left office that very week on
[57:53] the sixth all these numbers are perfect
[57:55] he left office that week on the sixth
[57:57] and he said in a statement that this is
[58:00] the saddest day the saddest day
[58:03] for the UK because the Queen's bright
[58:06] and Shining Light
[58:08] has finally gone out
[58:11] what an acknowledgment
[58:14] the Queen's bright can you imagine when
[58:17] when the this bride this queen leaves
[58:19] the face of this Earth
[58:21] and tribulation sets in the bright and
[58:24] Shining Light
[58:25] yeah sure yeah we're right at the ending
[58:29] of an era the this light that we have my
[58:32] brown sister is going to move out of
[58:33] here one of these days and tribulation
[58:35] is going to set in and people are going
[58:36] to go where is the Queen of Heaven where
[58:39] is the bright and The Shining Light we
[58:41] had what was holding back the wrath of
[58:44] God what was holding back tribulation
[58:46] and all these things what was holding
[58:48] back the mark of the beast it's the
[58:49] queen that's here but that error is
[58:51] ending right after how many seven Church
[58:55] ages and she reigned for 70 years
[58:59] God's trying to tell us something
[59:01] amen
[59:03] he goes on and he says she seemed so
[59:06] timeless
[59:08] and so wonderful that I'm afraid that we
[59:10] have come to believe like our children
[59:12] that she would just keep going on and on
[59:15] and on and sometimes in the message we
[59:17] feel like we're just going to keep going
[59:18] on and on but there's an end to this era
[59:21] also
[59:24] and then he starts talking more he says
[59:26] many are trying to feel figure out why
[59:29] are we feeling this way
[59:30] that's that's incredible huh these are
[59:33] politicians these are men of the world
[59:35] and they're saying we're trying to
[59:36] figure out why are we feeling this way
[59:38] he says it's right in the house of of
[59:40] Commons there I believe it was the the
[59:43] big house where they all sit and they
[59:44] and they talk back and forth argue about
[59:47] you know things but he said he's he
[59:49] stood right there and in front of all
[59:51] those people he says we're all trying to
[59:53] figure out why we're feeling this way
[59:55] why do we feel a great loss
[59:59] can you imagine when this queen will
[1:00:01] leave yeah many are trying to fill out
[1:00:04] figure this out he says what we have
[1:00:06] asked that 25 year old woman to do what
[1:00:09] we asked of her he says and then to
[1:00:11] think what she has given this country
[1:00:15] she showed the world how to love and to
[1:00:18] serve he says for many people she was a
[1:00:20] constant through many changes think
[1:00:22] about it 70 years
[1:00:25] 70 years
[1:00:29] being born in April 21 1926 she was 96
[1:00:34] years old when she died on September 8th
[1:00:37] she would have seen a lot you know she
[1:00:39] served in World War II
[1:00:41] she navigated through some heavy
[1:00:44] scandals and family troubles also yet
[1:00:46] holding her own standards you go find
[1:00:49] all this out it's really amazing
[1:00:51] reigning 70 years her Reigns spanned 15
[1:00:54] Prime Ministers and 14 U.S presidents
[1:01:00] just last week
[1:01:02] when prime minister Boris Johnson
[1:01:04] stepped down that would be a couple
[1:01:06] weeks a few weeks ago now the new prime
[1:01:08] minister was elected and her name is Liz
[1:01:12] so here the Queen Elizabeth leaves and
[1:01:15] the new prime minister is Liz why
[1:01:18] Elizabeth
[1:01:20] why Elizabeth why Queen Elizabeth II and
[1:01:22] why Liz and you're going to start seeing
[1:01:24] there's there's something I believe that
[1:01:25] God is trying to tell us
[1:01:28] Queen Elizabeth was only 25 years old
[1:01:31] when she became Queen she wasn't
[1:01:33] expected to become Queen but her uncle
[1:01:36] abdicated the throne
[1:01:38] okay we could say a lot about these
[1:01:40] things but let's keep moving here then
[1:01:42] her father became the king but he died
[1:01:45] leaving her the throne okay it range
[1:01:49] from six of February 1952 until the 8th
[1:01:53] of September the longest reign of any
[1:01:56] British monarch and the second longest
[1:01:58] in world history
[1:02:01] that's a long time
[1:02:03] you know I was I was driving along and
[1:02:05] and I think Brenda called me and and she
[1:02:08] said you know
[1:02:09] why do they say God Save the Queen and
[1:02:11] once she actually saved you know what
[1:02:14] what about her you know was she a
[1:02:16] Christian what you know so the question
[1:02:17] came up so and as she asked this
[1:02:19] question the news was was
[1:02:22] broadcasting her life and and went into
[1:02:25] how she was a Christian and how what
[1:02:28] kind of an example she was two
[1:02:30] Christians and basically the prayer of
[1:02:32] God saved the queen is is for God to
[1:02:34] protect the queen and give her a healthy
[1:02:37] long life obviously as a benefit to the
[1:02:39] nation
[1:02:43] I just hung up and and and the and the
[1:02:46] radio started talking about her Devotion
[1:02:48] to the Church of God
[1:02:49] and uh I believe it's Anglican the
[1:02:52] Anglican Church
[1:02:53] and then they were saying how that she
[1:02:56] she was a friend of brother Billy Graham
[1:02:58] so he can go look at all these things we
[1:03:00] know that Billy Graham was an angel to
[1:03:02] the to the churches as well and and just
[1:03:04] that she was a friend she had him
[1:03:05] actually in the palace there at a time
[1:03:07] and had conversations with him and all
[1:03:09] kinds of things but she was she was a
[1:03:11] believer in that sense
[1:03:14] this is a quote from her
[1:03:16] she said for me the teachings of Christ
[1:03:19] and my own personal accountability
[1:03:21] before God provide a framework in which
[1:03:23] I try to lead my life I like so many of
[1:03:26] you have drawn great comfort in
[1:03:28] difficult times from Christ's words and
[1:03:31] example
[1:03:32] it's amazing because the whole world is
[1:03:34] remembering these things that she said
[1:03:36] and did
[1:03:38] and then another person right at this
[1:03:40] time sent me a picture of the double
[1:03:41] rainbow over Buckingham Palace and I
[1:03:43] started to think Lord what are you
[1:03:44] trying to say
[1:03:45] who is this queen what was it all about
[1:03:47] then I and for me the connection was
[1:03:50] Elizabeth her name I'll just give you a
[1:03:52] few quotes right out of the message
[1:03:54] about what the prophet says about this
[1:03:56] queen Queen Elizabeth II he said just
[1:03:59] recently from England come to Queen she
[1:04:01] went up into Canada she visited all
[1:04:03] through Canada she came then to the
[1:04:05] United States and there would have been
[1:04:06] a person in the United States that would
[1:04:08] have would have every person would have
[1:04:10] loved to see that Queen when she visited
[1:04:12] he says what would you have thought this
[1:04:13] morning if the Queen of England he says
[1:04:15] though you're not one of her subjects he
[1:04:17] says you're an American subject but
[1:04:19] although what if she would come and
[1:04:20] knock at your door now look at the
[1:04:22] example he's using her for
[1:04:26] what if she wouldn't come and knock at
[1:04:28] your door he says and you would see her
[1:04:29] maids and so forth standing there and
[1:04:31] she would say I am the queen of England
[1:04:33] I am come to visit you what an honor
[1:04:36] that would be because of her importance
[1:04:38] she's the queen and one of the greatest
[1:04:40] Queens he says in the world is the Queen
[1:04:43] of England
[1:04:46] he says she has no power in this nation
[1:04:48] but because she's important you would be
[1:04:50] happy to let her in I'd be happy to let
[1:04:53] her in he says
[1:04:54] there's a lot of places you'll find he
[1:04:56] talks about this queen he speaks very
[1:04:57] highly of her
[1:04:58] but think of it tonight when you shook a
[1:05:01] brother or sister's hand coming into the
[1:05:02] door the queen of God
[1:05:06] all right just want you to ponder some
[1:05:09] of these things huh the testimony she
[1:05:11] left behind the the life she lived huh
[1:05:14] What About Us
[1:05:16] another place he says
[1:05:18] she's an important person she's the
[1:05:21] greatest Queen on Earth nationally
[1:05:22] speaking and we'd have to have to honor
[1:05:25] her we had to have an honor for her to
[1:05:27] come
[1:05:28] he says who who's more important than
[1:05:31] Jesus tonight Who's Who who's more
[1:05:33] turned away than Jesus and who is
[1:05:36] greater than he is
[1:05:38] right so using this parallel between
[1:05:40] this queen and Jesus Christ even
[1:05:43] another place he says she's the greatest
[1:05:45] Earthly Queen on Earth and anyone would
[1:05:47] feel honored why the newspapers would
[1:05:49] pack it everywhere
[1:05:50] excuse me
[1:05:52] he says the television would show it and
[1:05:54] that the Queen of England humbled
[1:05:56] herself to come down and knock at the
[1:05:57] door of some poor person's house another
[1:05:59] message he says you see though you're
[1:06:01] not at her subject but she's the
[1:06:03] greatest Queen on earth that is of the
[1:06:05] Realms of the nations of and he says
[1:06:08] England Queen of England the greatest
[1:06:09] Queen on the earth that we have today
[1:06:13] incredible what a what an acclimation to
[1:06:16] give of the queen
[1:06:18] her 21st birthday was was in 1947 which
[1:06:22] is when the message started to be
[1:06:23] recorded
[1:06:24] and she was in South Africa I knew
[1:06:26] there'd be some South Africans here
[1:06:27] tonight they probably like that but she
[1:06:29] was in a tour in South Africa during
[1:06:31] this time and in a speech in a broadcast
[1:06:33] on the radio and from Cape Town the
[1:06:36] princess dedicated her life to the
[1:06:37] service of the Commonwealth says I
[1:06:40] declare before you all before you all
[1:06:43] that my whole life whether it be long or
[1:06:46] short shall be devoted to your service
[1:06:48] and to the service of our great Imperial
[1:06:50] family to which we all belong
[1:06:53] so you might be asking Chris where are
[1:06:55] we going with this tonight
[1:06:57] Elizabeth
[1:06:59] means God is my oath
[1:07:02] and I want to talk about God's Queen
[1:07:05] the queen of the oath
[1:07:07] but her name means God is my oath or God
[1:07:10] is my abundance
[1:07:12] an oath remember is stronger than a
[1:07:15] promise
[1:07:16] an oath is generally something that is
[1:07:18] made between governments or royalties or
[1:07:21] in a marriage
[1:07:24] an oath is a solemn promise it's
[1:07:26] unbreakable in other words it's a
[1:07:28] commitment you cannot change it's a
[1:07:31] pledge unto another an oath ultimately
[1:07:34] means a guarantee
[1:07:36] in other words this queen her name means
[1:07:39] God is my guarantee
[1:07:42] so think about what what we carry with
[1:07:45] us we are also under an oath under a
[1:07:47] guarantee amen God is my guarantee so
[1:07:51] Elizabeth is really the connection for
[1:07:53] us tonight it's the name the meaning of
[1:07:55] this name now we can we're going to
[1:07:57] follow some of these names Through the
[1:07:58] Bible here this evening and you're going
[1:07:59] to find that find find a very uh
[1:08:02] incredible similarity between all of
[1:08:04] these and the connection is that their
[1:08:06] names mean God is my oath okay so let's
[1:08:09] look at this a little bit in Hebrews 7
[1:08:10] let's go to the new New Testament
[1:08:13] Hebrews 7 11.
[1:08:15] if there if therefore Perfection were by
[1:08:18] the levitical priesthood for under it
[1:08:20] the people received the law what further
[1:08:23] need was there that another priest
[1:08:25] should rise after the order of
[1:08:26] Melchizedek and not be called after the
[1:08:28] order of Aaron now this order of Aaron
[1:08:31] this he's a he's a great priesthood
[1:08:33] right amen God did a great thing through
[1:08:36] Aaron this was the the first setting up
[1:08:38] of of the government of God with his
[1:08:41] Tabernacle and making sacrifices making
[1:08:43] a way for the people he was the order of
[1:08:46] Aaron right and we see here that there's
[1:08:48] another order amen there's another
[1:08:50] priest coming after the order of of of
[1:08:52] Aaron but what is Aaron so let's go
[1:08:55] right back to the beginning remember
[1:08:56] Aaron's wife what was her name
[1:08:59] Ella Shiva
[1:09:02] it's like Elizabeth Shiva elashiba or
[1:09:05] God's name is l right you look at all
[1:09:08] the different variations of her name
[1:09:10] they they try and figure out how her
[1:09:12] name came to be and what her meaning is
[1:09:14] and literally these are the things
[1:09:15] you're going to find out that it's a
[1:09:16] combination of Elizabeth and sheba now
[1:09:19] what is the queen of the South
[1:09:21] who is the queen of the South is the
[1:09:23] Queen of Sheba so you're going to find
[1:09:25] this connection of the oath of God or
[1:09:27] the queen of the oath all throughout the
[1:09:29] scriptures under the order of Aaron
[1:09:32] amen
[1:09:33] remember Aaron's wife was named elisheva
[1:09:36] the oath or the fullness of God now it's
[1:09:39] important to recognize that she was the
[1:09:42] daughter of a minidab meaning that she
[1:09:44] was from a royal family
[1:09:46] okay so she was royalty in those days
[1:09:49] elishiba by marrying Aaron became
[1:09:52] connected to the tribe of Levi or the
[1:09:55] priesthood
[1:09:56] so she fell under that privilege of the
[1:09:59] priesthood
[1:10:00] Exodus 6 and 23 says and Aaron took him
[1:10:04] elishiba there's the name for you in
[1:10:06] case you want to see it in the
[1:10:07] scriptures there daughter of a minidab
[1:10:09] sister of nashan to wife and she bear
[1:10:12] him nadab and abihu elizar and ethamar
[1:10:16] another priesthood though is rising out
[1:10:19] out of the order of Melchizedek right so
[1:10:22] we're gonna I'm jumping in Leafs here
[1:10:24] because I just want to show you the
[1:10:25] connections and then you can go Ponder
[1:10:27] these things later so let's go back now
[1:10:29] to the New Testament because we know
[1:10:30] another priesthood is rising up
[1:10:34] Hebrews 7 and 15 says and yet it it is
[1:10:37] far more evident that for that after the
[1:10:40] similitude of Melchizedek there
[1:10:43] arrivesth another priest
[1:10:45] who is made not after the law of a
[1:10:47] carnal commandment but after the power
[1:10:49] of an endless life so this is awesome
[1:10:52] because this is the priesthood that we
[1:10:55] have come under amen but look at how he
[1:10:57] describes the priesthood here or his
[1:10:59] rulership or or his care or Devotion to
[1:11:02] you
[1:11:03] in verse 21 he goes on
[1:11:06] this is from the Amplified just so you
[1:11:08] can see the more descriptive language he
[1:11:10] says and it was not without the taking
[1:11:12] of an oath
[1:11:14] see the queen of the oath right
[1:11:17] that Christ was made priest
[1:11:20] taking of an oath by God but this one
[1:11:23] was designated and addressed and saluted
[1:11:26] with an oath
[1:11:28] in other words a guarantee
[1:11:31] this priesthood was established with a
[1:11:34] guarantee the Lord has sworn and will
[1:11:37] not regret it amen
[1:11:39] or change his mind you are a priest
[1:11:43] forever according to the order of
[1:11:44] Melchizedek so we are a queen under this
[1:11:48] priesthood amen amen but look at this I
[1:11:51] I love that he's it's he will not regret
[1:11:54] it he will not change his mind it's of
[1:11:56] an endless life right this is the queen
[1:11:59] this is the kind of Queen We Are
[1:12:05] in keeping with the oath's greater
[1:12:07] strength and force Jesus has become the
[1:12:10] guarantee of a better stronger agreement
[1:12:13] a more excellent and more advantageous
[1:12:17] sorry
[1:12:19] a more advantageous Covenant
[1:12:23] an oath greater strength and force my
[1:12:26] this is beautiful language through here
[1:12:27] go find out what kind of government we
[1:12:29] are under amen as a queen we are the
[1:12:32] queen of that oath of the guarantee of
[1:12:35] God
[1:12:36] all right
[1:12:38] verse 25 as 24
[1:12:42] says then he holds this priesthood
[1:12:43] unchangeably because he lives on forever
[1:12:46] verse 25 sorry says therefore he is able
[1:12:49] also to save to the uttermost completely
[1:12:52] perfectly finally and for all Time and
[1:12:56] Eternity those who come to God through
[1:12:57] him
[1:12:58] since he is always living to make
[1:13:00] petition to God and intercede with him
[1:13:03] and intervene for them
[1:13:06] I mean I know it's amazing right okay
[1:13:08] verse 26 says here is the high priest
[1:13:12] perfectly adapted to our needs as was
[1:13:16] fitting holy blameless unstained by sin
[1:13:19] separated from Sinners and exalted
[1:13:22] higher than the heavens the queen of the
[1:13:25] oath
[1:13:26] and you think of what that man was
[1:13:28] saying when he said this is the end of
[1:13:29] an era amen this bride is leaving my
[1:13:32] brother and sister the bride of Christ
[1:13:33] we're reaching the end of an era amen
[1:13:36] the church ages have run out amen we're
[1:13:38] just living in the last few moments of
[1:13:40] this era the seven Church ages are
[1:13:42] finished amen we're at an end of an era
[1:13:45] it's all going to change amen and this
[1:13:47] queen of this oath is going to lift off
[1:13:49] out of here and go into another
[1:13:50] dimension
[1:13:52] oh my
[1:13:54] God oh my what's God trying to tell us
[1:13:55] if that Queen is left Elizabeth the
[1:13:58] queen of the oath amen amen it's it's
[1:14:01] changing time amen
[1:14:03] changing of administration time amen
[1:14:07] Hallelujah
[1:14:08] all right
[1:14:10] we can look at other elizabeths but even
[1:14:12] when the king of Heaven came down the
[1:14:15] word was made flesh there was an
[1:14:17] Elizabeth on the scene amen and God gave
[1:14:20] her a promise amen that a son would be
[1:14:22] born that her womb would bear fruit
[1:14:24] right and she was in Elizabeth right I
[1:14:27] loved that and she brought forth John
[1:14:29] the prophet of the day
[1:14:32] they would forerun the coming of the
[1:14:34] Lord right it's just perfect how this
[1:14:36] name Elizabeth shows up in our
[1:14:38] scriptures
[1:14:39] Hallelujah
[1:14:41] God trying to show us that he is God huh
[1:14:44] he's the god of his oath he made a
[1:14:45] promise to Elizabeth that she was going
[1:14:47] to Bear a child and he was going to be a
[1:14:49] great man amen and yet even though that
[1:14:52] child had died in her womb wasn't moving
[1:14:54] amen he gave him the Holy Ghost in his
[1:14:56] womb
[1:14:58] oh man brought it back to life why
[1:15:00] because he's the god of the guarantee
[1:15:03] amen if you're waiting on a promise
[1:15:05] tonight you're the queen of the oath of
[1:15:06] God
[1:15:08] Hallelujah
[1:15:10] the queen of the South so you can
[1:15:12] imagine when God said the queen of the
[1:15:13] South shall rise up now the queen of the
[1:15:16] oath the queen of the guarantee is going
[1:15:18] to rise up she's going to attest she's
[1:15:19] going to give have a testimony like
[1:15:21] night like we had tonight amen amen of
[1:15:24] God's faithfulness of his goodness
[1:15:27] praise the Lord
[1:15:29] all right so Queen of the South so the
[1:15:31] queen of the South and and other uh
[1:15:33] books so Luke or Matthew whichever one
[1:15:36] you're going to read the story from
[1:15:37] it'll it'll either say the queen of the
[1:15:39] South or the Queen of Sheba so Sheba the
[1:15:42] Queen of Sheba is a place Sheba is a
[1:15:45] place
[1:15:47] huh Shiva is mentioned in job 6 19. it's
[1:15:52] the country of Sheba job 6 19 says it
[1:15:55] like this
[1:15:56] the troops of tema looked the companies
[1:15:59] of Shiva waited for them what was
[1:16:02] happening at this time they they were
[1:16:04] waiting for water
[1:16:06] this country of Shiva they were thirsty
[1:16:10] it was a dry time a time of famine and
[1:16:13] and so they sent out troops and and
[1:16:14] Warriors and men to go and search out
[1:16:16] for water and the countrymen of Sheba
[1:16:19] were waiting for the reports and this is
[1:16:21] beautiful because this is exactly what
[1:16:23] happens with the queen of the South she
[1:16:25] was looking for more of God she was
[1:16:27] hungering after the Lord she was looking
[1:16:29] for water in a dry Place amen and right
[1:16:33] away in job in the Book of Job which is
[1:16:35] one of the oldest books in the Bible
[1:16:36] think about that amen before you know
[1:16:39] before all the histories began we find
[1:16:41] This Book of Job the oldest book in the
[1:16:43] Bible and what does it tell us that
[1:16:45] they're in the land of Shiva there was
[1:16:47] Messengers being sent out people were
[1:16:49] looking for water they were searching
[1:16:51] for something amen praise the Lord
[1:16:55] Shiva also means oath this country means
[1:16:59] the place of the oath
[1:17:03] I'm going to skip through these verses
[1:17:05] you can go read in job here about these
[1:17:07] people as they were going through so
[1:17:09] this place here means the the place of
[1:17:12] the oath or the seven
[1:17:14] the place of the seven right it's
[1:17:16] interesting Shiva seven seven Church
[1:17:19] ages making up a bride I mean it's just
[1:17:21] perfect how all this fits together right
[1:17:25] all right let's move on here
[1:17:27] oh my
[1:17:29] yeah we don't have time for all of us
[1:17:31] here this evening
[1:17:33] so anyway as as we're looking at
[1:17:35] Elizabeth Queen of the oath these events
[1:17:38] started to perk my interest
[1:17:40] all the Queens in the Bible we can talk
[1:17:42] about them tonight we don't have time
[1:17:43] for that this evening but this queen of
[1:17:45] the South
[1:17:46] you know it's incredible that the God
[1:17:48] could have used a lot of people from the
[1:17:50] scriptures and said he's going to raise
[1:17:51] that one up for in the day of judgment
[1:17:54] in other words at the very culmination
[1:17:56] of everything when it's all said and
[1:17:58] done this is the woman he's going to
[1:18:00] raise up the woman of the guarantee in
[1:18:02] other words if the guarantee didn't work
[1:18:04] for her
[1:18:05] right then it's no good but he's going
[1:18:08] to prove that his insurance policy his
[1:18:10] guarantee is good amen that he was
[1:18:12] faithful to the end the queen of the
[1:18:14] guarantee but I want you to remember
[1:18:16] look at the attitude of the queen of the
[1:18:19] guarantee the queen of the oath what was
[1:18:21] her attitude like First Kings 10 and 1.
[1:18:25] scribes her a little bit and says and
[1:18:27] when the Queen of Sheba heard of the
[1:18:29] fame of Solomon concerning the name of
[1:18:32] the Lord she heard about somebody amen
[1:18:35] and she came to prove him with hard
[1:18:37] questions in other words Lord who am I
[1:18:41] she wanted to know Solomon where did you
[1:18:43] get this wisdom how do you know these
[1:18:45] things how do you how do you open the
[1:18:47] word like that how do you discern the
[1:18:49] the thoughts and intents of the people's
[1:18:50] hearts how do you do these things
[1:18:51] Solomon she heard about the wisdom of
[1:18:54] Solomon and it wasn't just his his
[1:18:56] wisdom but she heard about the name of
[1:18:58] the Lord
[1:18:59] in other words through Solomon's wisdom
[1:19:01] there was a declaration of the name of
[1:19:03] the Lord the lord's name went out
[1:19:05] through all the nations and it tells us
[1:19:07] that she came from the uttermost parts
[1:19:09] of the world in other words the gospel
[1:19:11] went and was preached to the outermost
[1:19:13] parts of the world and here she comes
[1:19:15] now all the way to Solomon
[1:19:17] oh my the resource the the Fountain of
[1:19:20] that wisdom
[1:19:22] look at her attitude though right when
[1:19:24] she heard about God she said she was
[1:19:26] willing to come and sit at Solomon's
[1:19:28] feet and ask the questions
[1:19:30] who am I where am I going to end up what
[1:19:33] is my final destination what are your
[1:19:35] plans for me right the hard questions
[1:19:38] the question of life you know
[1:19:42] so where does she go she goes back to
[1:19:44] the beginning
[1:19:45] and she came to Jerusalem
[1:19:47] with a great very great train with
[1:19:50] camels that bear spices and very much
[1:19:53] gold and precious stones and when she
[1:19:55] was come to Solomon she communed with
[1:19:57] him
[1:19:58] of all that was in her heart
[1:20:01] that to me is beautiful I would have
[1:20:04] loved to sit in on that conversation
[1:20:06] she came with gifts and in other words
[1:20:08] she came with everything her kingdom
[1:20:10] everything her culture everything her
[1:20:12] life everything she knew she brought it
[1:20:15] to Solomon right she laid it all out
[1:20:17] there for Solomon she she found entrance
[1:20:20] to Solomon and the Bible tells us that
[1:20:22] she communed and she had fellowship with
[1:20:24] Solomon
[1:20:25] you know Solomon I've brought you
[1:20:27] everything that my life consists of all
[1:20:29] my history my peoples my my the spices
[1:20:32] of our country it's beautiful if you
[1:20:34] look at why she brought all these things
[1:20:35] you know she all those little things
[1:20:37] represent something of her history her
[1:20:39] past her identity she laid all those
[1:20:42] things out before Solomon and she
[1:20:44] communed with him
[1:20:46] everything that was on her heart
[1:20:49] the queen of the oath the queen of Shiva
[1:20:52] Queen of the South
[1:20:58] and Solomon told her all her questions
[1:21:02] in other words all the Mysteries were
[1:21:04] made plain all her questions were
[1:21:06] answered there was no more mystery
[1:21:07] anymore everything was made plain
[1:21:10] you see what God has done for us and to
[1:21:12] think that a greater than Solomon is
[1:21:14] here
[1:21:18] told her all her questions there was not
[1:21:21] anything hid from the King which he told
[1:21:24] her not and when the Queen of Sheba had
[1:21:27] seen all Solomon's wisdom and the house
[1:21:30] that he had built
[1:21:32] now this is beautiful right because
[1:21:35] she's sitting there
[1:21:36] we don't want to just read it tonight we
[1:21:38] want to look at what's really happening
[1:21:40] right what is happening there she's
[1:21:41] sitting there in in the in the presence
[1:21:43] of Solomon the wisest man in all the
[1:21:46] Earth who has now opened the Mysteries
[1:21:48] to her tell told her that the very
[1:21:50] secrets of her heart and there was
[1:21:52] nothing that was on her heart that he
[1:21:54] could not answer in other words somebody
[1:21:56] knew this woman amen knew all about her
[1:21:59] could see the very secrets of her heart
[1:22:01] right but look at this now she as she's
[1:22:04] sitting there
[1:22:05] and the story starts to kind of progress
[1:22:07] she sees all of Solomon's wisdom in
[1:22:10] other words all the Mysteries start to
[1:22:11] become made plain right in the days of
[1:22:13] the voice right all the Mysteries start
[1:22:15] to be open and there's no more question
[1:22:16] really about whose presence she's in but
[1:22:18] then she starts to see the Tabernacle in
[1:22:20] other words it's opened up the whole
[1:22:22] Plan of Redemption she sees his house
[1:22:25] you know what's important about that
[1:22:27] right the house
[1:22:29] but the Bible is very clear that she
[1:22:31] sees his house now she's a queen I'm
[1:22:33] sure she came from a big Palace and
[1:22:35] great things were around her and you
[1:22:37] know maybe you know if if another
[1:22:39] Monarch today went to another monarchs
[1:22:41] home you maybe not won't be that big of
[1:22:43] a deal because you know they're all
[1:22:44] wealthy and Rich and well established
[1:22:47] but she notices his house and the
[1:22:49] scriptures make sure that we see that in
[1:22:51] other words we see the house of the Lord
[1:22:53] you know when we come to God and I want
[1:22:55] to be very clear tonight that when we
[1:22:57] come with a with a humble heart like the
[1:23:00] Queen of Sheba and we come and sit at
[1:23:02] the Lord's feet and we say Lord here's
[1:23:04] every all my possessions and Lord I have
[1:23:06] questions and things on my heart God
[1:23:08] will answer all your questions for you
[1:23:10] all the things that are on your heart
[1:23:11] and and not just that then he'll start
[1:23:14] to open up the bigger picture amen the
[1:23:16] the pattern that was in heaven came down
[1:23:18] and was built in the as the house of the
[1:23:20] Lord where the Lord would dwell and she
[1:23:22] starts to notice that house and how that
[1:23:24] all works I was covered with Badger
[1:23:26] skins amen speaking about our human
[1:23:28] flesh and and she starts to recognize
[1:23:30] hey that that's not just the Lord's
[1:23:31] house that's me he's talking about me
[1:23:34] and all the the way it's built right she
[1:23:36] she starts to receive revelation
[1:23:40] oh my what a beautiful story we have

[1:23:47] his table

[1:23:55] and the sitting of his servants in other
[1:23:58] words the pillars right the the apostles
[1:24:01] and the prophets she starts to notice
[1:24:03] the position of everyone right that
[1:24:05] they're in his right hand the seven
[1:24:07] Messengers The Seven Stars the seven
[1:24:09] Church ages and she sees the seven
[1:24:11] candlesticks man she's standing she's
[1:24:13] she's like John being lifted up into the
[1:24:16] presence of God she can see the house
[1:24:18] she can see the sitting of his servants
[1:24:20] the meat that's at his table she's there

[1:28:01] judgment and justice
[1:28:03] and she gave the king 120 talents of
[1:28:06] gold and of spices great very great
[1:28:08] store and precious stones there came no
[1:28:11] more such abundance of spices as these
[1:28:14] which the Queen of Sheba gave to King
[1:28:17] Solomon
[1:28:20] it's like that woman that came to Jesus
[1:28:22] feet and poured out her spices poured
[1:28:26] out her her oil
[1:28:27] from her little alabaster box that meant
[1:28:30] more
[1:28:31] than all the riches that was in that

[1:28:49] sit under the word of God and you know I
[1:28:51] look across this room it's a very
[1:28:52] Multicultural room here tonight but
[1:28:54] we've come from the outermost parts of
[1:28:56] the world to want to pour out our lives
[1:28:58] pour out our sacrifices our spices
[1:29:00] before the Lord and I believe that God
[1:29:02] will be able to say there was never such
[1:29:04] a Time amen because we we you know the
[1:29:07] Angels cannot sing like us you know that
[1:29:09] tonight
[1:29:10] the Angels cannot worship like we can
[1:29:12] worship
[1:29:16] oh my
[1:29:17] all right let's try and move forward
[1:29:18] here a little bit more verse 11 says and
[1:29:21] the Navy the Navy also of Hiram that
[1:29:25] bought brought gold from over brought in
[1:29:28] from o for a great plenty of all mug
[1:29:31] trees and precious stones and the King
[1:29:33] made of the Omak trees pillars for the
[1:29:35] house of the Lord and for the King's
[1:29:37] house Harps also and sulturies for
[1:29:39] singers there came no such almond trees
[1:29:42] nor were seen unto this day
[1:29:45] everything turned into the foundations
[1:29:48] of the House of the pillars and you know
[1:29:51] their lives in other words my brother
[1:29:52] and sister the things you bring to the
[1:29:53] house of God become memorials they
[1:29:56] become pillars they become testimonies
[1:29:58] like you gave tonight amen and when we
[1:30:01] are raised up in that day my brother and
[1:30:02] sister God will say there was never such
[1:30:04] a time as that time when I ruled with My
[1:30:06] Little Queen on the earth the queen of
[1:30:08] the guarantee
[1:30:13] oh I feel good tonight
[1:30:16] oh
[1:30:17] that's verse here verse 13. and King
[1:30:20] Solomon gave unto the Queen of Sheba all
[1:30:23] her desire
[1:30:25] all her desire whatsoever she asked
[1:30:29] beside that which Solomon gave her of
[1:30:32] his Royal Bounty so she turned and went
[1:30:35] to her own country she and her servants
[1:30:40] you think of what he's saying here
[1:30:42] besides uh his Royal bounty
[1:30:46] so besides what he was already planning
[1:30:48] to give her
[1:30:49] you know she came with just a little
[1:30:51] extra
[1:30:52] Lord but remember also my family
[1:30:55] right she just had a few extra requests
[1:30:57] you know on top of what the royalty
