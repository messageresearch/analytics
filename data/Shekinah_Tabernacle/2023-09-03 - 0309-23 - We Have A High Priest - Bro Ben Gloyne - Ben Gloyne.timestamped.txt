[10:06] morning we good we feeling good oh amen
[10:10] it's good to be here it's good to have
[10:11] the opportunity to um Worship the Lord
[10:14] this
[10:15] morning and every time we meet with the
[10:18] Lord we always are blessed you know we
[10:20] never we never come away empty-handed
[10:23] but we always come away full and
[10:24] refreshed in the the presence of God
[10:28] hallelujah
[10:29] I had
[10:30] a message to uh greet uh Isaac and his
[10:36] wife from Cape
[10:38] [Music]
[10:43] Town and I couldn't forget the
[10:46] [Music]
[10:52] name my mother called me Isaac
[10:56] because there was something funny I
[10:58] think
[11:00] when I was going to be born I think the
[11:03] placenta apparently was is a condition
[11:05] where it's at the
[11:07] bottom of me and then I guess when it
[11:09] something happens in it the placenta
[11:12] ruptures you'd know what the term is
[11:15] used to be reasonably fatal back in the
[11:17] old days when they couldn't do much
[11:18] about it
[11:20] um so I ended up being a cerian but my
[11:23] mother had a promise from the Lord that
[11:25] said I'll give you this son and of
[11:27] course Isaac is like the promised son so
[11:31] that's so I was a struggle to get
[11:36] here but you know if God's got a purpose
[11:39] and a cause then his purpose and his
[11:40] cause will stand you know and uh David
[11:44] was telling me there was a certain
[11:46] General in the um US Army during the
[11:49] Civil
[11:50] War you know when the bullets were
[11:53] flying and the Cannons were blasting and
[11:56] there was war war and everything all
[11:59] around him he just wasn't phased one bit
[12:01] he's just walking around chatting and
[12:04] talking and a I think a guy from the
[12:07] media was there and he
[12:08] said you know why are you like this
[12:11] can't you see and everyone's diving away
[12:12] and ducking for cover and dodging the
[12:14] bullets and he said look I'm not going
[12:16] to go one minute before my
[12:18] time the Lord's got a plan and a purpose
[12:21] for me if I'm not if I'm going to die
[12:23] today I'm going to die today but if not
[12:25] I ain't going to die no bullets are
[12:27] going to hit me so I'm just going to
[12:28] walk around and not worry about a
[12:30] thing may we have that courage you know
[12:33] when we when we serve the Lord that you
[12:35] know come on May we're just going to
[12:37] keep serving the lord in in in faith and
[12:40] in Hope and in Joy amen come on May and
[12:42] when it's our time to go we'll go when
[12:44] it's when our time is over let's um

[12:48] service to the

[48:06] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[48:09] bless you friends you may have your
[48:10] seats this morning so I'd like to speak
[48:12] about how we have a high priest and you
[48:14] know uh I just love the scripture I
[48:16] think it was Lao actually put on the um
[48:18] brothers and sisters there's interview
[48:19] with a uh brother there in New York and
[48:21] he and I think one of these scriptures
[48:23] here really gripped him and he became a
[48:25] Believer but you know we were watching
[48:26] this and Christine said you know that's
[48:27] really a bride kind of a scripture you
[48:29] know and when you think about where God
[48:31] has chosen us and him before the
[48:32] foundation of the world that we should
[48:34] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[48:36] love amen that you know I believe that
[48:38] we have come to a stage in our journey
[48:40] our trust we have where we're not
[48:41] trusting in our own ability you know
[48:43] we're not trusting in our own merits or
[48:45] you know that we've really realized in
[48:47] ourselves that our own righteousness is
[48:49] but filthy rags in his sight that that
[48:51] we're not approaching him with our
[48:52] ability our track record or anything we
[48:55] could humanly bring but only his blood
[48:57] can we present amen it's only his
[48:59] sacrifice that matters it's it's nothing
[49:01] we can do amen and now that doesn't mean
[49:03] we just say well what's the point in
[49:05] trying or serving him no we should serve
[49:07] him with all of our hearts all of our
[49:08] mind soul mind and strength because he's
[49:10] worthy amen but it's really him that
[49:14] makes us righteous it's not our own
[49:15] selves so you know so I just want to I
[49:17] want to just go through there was a um
[49:20] very interesting quote that I that I
[49:22] read uh during the week I thought it was
[49:24] very striking brother says now my prayer
[49:26] is that the same person will open to us
[49:28] the scriptures tonight it's a very
[49:30] timely scripture reading because we're
[49:32] again in the resurrection in the Easter
[49:33] season now you say it's not Easter today
[49:35] no it's but it's springtime life is
[49:37] coming forth amen and actually we are
[49:39] continuously in an Easter a Resurrection
[49:41] season we're living in the Rapture
[49:43] season so I think this applies very
[49:45] nicely amen so um and I think it's one
[49:48] of the greatest scriptures that's more
[49:49] neglected than any Scripture um I know
[49:52] of being preached on is the Ascension of
[49:54] the Lord Jesus what he did after his
[49:56] resurrection I thought there was a very
[49:58] striking comment that you know there's a
[50:00] uh um you know one of the greatest
[50:02] neglected scriptures is what he did when
[50:04] he became our high priest he's still our
[50:06] high priest today because when you think
[50:08] about it it's very easy just to talk
[50:09] about a historical God and what he did
[50:11] and we praise him for what he did but
[50:13] what is he doing amen and we're going to
[50:14] realize that you know I know this is I'm
[50:16] preaching to the choir today and we all
[50:18] know he's a personal God and he's here
[50:20] to meet our needs he's mindful of every
[50:22] situation he cares about you and I more
[50:24] than we care about about ourselves amen
[50:26] he loves us more than you know we can
[50:28] even fathom but you know he's not
[50:30] distant he doesn't he doesn't close his
[50:33] ears to our prayers he cares about what
[50:35] we're going through he's not the silent
[50:38] God you know that just sits up in heaven
[50:40] like this and watches his plan unfold
[50:42] but he's working in the lives of men and
[50:44] women boys and girls around the earth
[50:46] that his word would be fulfilled and if
[50:49] we can just view him in a greater way in
[50:51] this way you you as I've said I'm
[50:53] preaching to the choir you know but I
[50:54] think maybe it's just is helpful for me
[50:56] to remember he's not he he's not
[50:59] distracted he's not far away somewhere
[51:01] you know he cares about you and I he's
[51:03] actively finding us he's keeping us you
[51:07] the god that found us is not going to
[51:08] lose us he's not going to he saved us to
[51:11] keep us amen I heard a sister overseas
[51:13] say I thought that such a outstanding
[51:15] comment he saved us to keep us I mean he
[51:18] didn't save us to lose us you know he
[51:20] didn't he didn't save us to do a halfway
[51:22] job he's going to complete what he
[51:23] started amen and if he's going to
[51:25] complete what he started no devil and
[51:26] hell can stop him and our and our own
[51:29] Humanity can't stop him neither I mean
[51:31] God will do what he wants to do and I
[51:34] think it's such a privilege where by his
[51:36] grace we can get behind what he's doing
[51:38] and mean we can say Lord I'm here you
[51:39] know I you I have no ability but I'm
[51:42] available amen and that's what he wants
[51:44] he wants people to be available amen
[51:46] that he can work through it's not what
[51:47] we think we can do it's what we know he
[51:49] can do that matters amen so I thought
[51:52] this was a very outstanding thing now
[51:53] the Lord he did not just sit down on the
[51:55] tomb after his resurrection because his
[51:57] work wasn't completed it wasn't finished
[51:59] and the ones at the grave that morning
[52:00] were forbidden to even touch him but
[52:02] that night the bidden to come and feel
[52:04] his hands he forbid his mother to touch
[52:06] him said I've not yet ascended unto my
[52:07] father uh my God and yours and he had
[52:10] not yet he would um he would only ready
[52:13] to do his great high priest work at that
[52:15] time he had just been anointed so so he
[52:19] so he is now he is now our high priest
[52:23] he's our intercessor he's our mediator
[52:25] he's our advocate he is actively working
[52:27] on our behalf right he is not the silent
[52:29] God but he is the same yesterday today
[52:32] and forever he is alive and well now
[52:34] many people will look through history
[52:35] and criticize you know what the church
[52:38] has gone through down through seven
[52:39] Church ages they'll look in the Dark
[52:40] Ages and say well you know if God is God
[52:43] how can he let his children be burnt at
[52:45] the Stak and fed to lions and horrible
[52:47] acts of torture and things done and you
[52:49] know it's like he just became the silent
[52:51] God they say where was he but you know
[52:53] people forget that God has had a plan
[52:55] down through seven Church ages from
[52:56] Calvary to now and you know there had to
[52:58] be a time because Jesus said unless a
[53:00] corn of wheat goes and dies and falls in
[53:02] the ground it abides alone but if it but
[53:04] if it comes forth it'll bring forth much
[53:06] fruit now he wasn't just talking about
[53:08] his own self but he's talking about the
[53:09] church that that sure because the day of
[53:12] P the book of Acts the day of Pentecost
[53:14] it wasn't a harvest it was just a quick
[53:17] manifestation of the maturity of the
[53:19] Sons and Daughters of God Holy Ghost
[53:21] working in power but then the church had
[53:23] to go from there down to the around the
[53:25] Dark Ages to come forth in the
[53:26] Restoration in the end time and so now
[53:29] when people look at history they think
[53:31] God doesn't care you know he just left
[53:33] his children to be massacred and things
[53:34] but they had an expression to manifest
[53:37] you know every season we you know we're
[53:39] in spring now we weren't in Spring a few
[53:40] months ago it was cold it was hailing
[53:43] there was snow around and so nature
[53:45] couldn't manifest like it could now but
[53:48] it had it season season then but now
[53:50] it's a different season now life is
[53:51] coming forth it's the same thing with
[53:54] the Dark Ages you under that persecution
[53:56] of that false Church you know went down
[53:59] underground it was planted for for a
[54:02] resurrection and now we're living in
[54:03] that spring that summer time Hallelujah
[54:06] but you know a Critic would write a book
[54:07] called The Silent God he said now God
[54:09] through thousands of years of Dark Ages
[54:11] would sit still and never move a hand
[54:13] and watch faithful Martyrs go to the
[54:15] Lion's pits be burnt Ro um by the Romans
[54:18] um assassination of all kinds women
[54:20] stripped of their clothes set on fire
[54:21] long hair with tar burn them remember
[54:23] short hair began in Rome and and women
[54:25] of Christians had long hair they di them
[54:27] in to and set them a fire and burn them
[54:29] and them naked fed them to lions and
[54:31] this Rider goes to say where is that God
[54:33] says oh the blindness of man sometimes
[54:36] did you not know that that seed had to
[54:38] die he never tried to deliver them he
[54:41] they went down in Victory and that's the
[54:43] main thing in life that we go down in
[54:45] Victory if it's by the way of the Grave
[54:47] it's by the body change we go by in
[54:50] Victory in faith amen that we do not
[54:53] fear what man can do unto us amen you it
[54:56] doesn't matter what happens to this body
[54:57] but we go victorious in faith maybe
[55:00] because because the faith that God has
[55:02] given us the world can't take it from us
[55:04] the devil can't take it from us
[55:06] circumstance can't take it from us no if
[55:09] God given you faith God will keep that
[55:11] faith in you Hallelujah so we can stand
[55:14] with such an assurance the Lord is our
[55:15] helper amen he's our strength and our
[55:17] Shield am mean we have a high priest who
[55:19] is who is who is who is standing for us
[55:22] in this
[55:23] hour Hallelujah
[55:26] now we read in the church ages I don't
[55:28] have the scripture here but he said y y
[55:30] John um you know Revelations chapter 1
[55:32] it says that John turned to look to a
[55:34] man you know like the son of man walking
[55:36] among the seven golden candlesticks and
[55:39] then at the end of that chapter the
[55:40] interpretation that symbol was the seven
[55:42] golden candlesticks are the seven
[55:43] churches now we understand from The Book
[55:45] of Revelation that it is not just the
[55:48] condition in those seven churches was a
[55:49] prophetic thing speaking of the future
[55:52] so but it was showing that Jesus Christ
[55:54] is walking down down from Calvary
[55:56] through the book of Acts down into this
[55:57] time he's been walking with his children
[56:00] all the way down through and he will not
[56:02] stop walking with us amen he was there
[56:04] in the Dark Ages he was there in the
[56:06] Coliseum he was there in the torture
[56:08] chambers he was there in prison amen he
[56:11] was there with Martin Luther and down
[56:12] through the reformation and he's here
[56:14] today amen he's the same yesterday today
[56:16] and forever am mean see and it's not the
[56:19] condition or the state we find ourselves
[56:21] in dictates whether he's with you or not
[56:24] no he's with you because he said mean he
[56:26] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[56:28] you I'll be with you even in you to the
[56:30] end of the world that's the promise our
[56:31] God has made amen and we can rest in
[56:34] that promise because he said
[56:36] so me he says now think of it not uh not
[56:39] one believer of any age need to cry in
[56:41] his heart oh that I might have been back
[56:43] there in the first age when the apostles
[56:45] were first set out we don't need to cry
[56:47] that it would have been nice but we
[56:50] don't need to we don't need to cry if
[56:52] only I was back there no there is no
[56:54] need to look back look up Behold Him who
[56:57] is even now walking in the midst of the
[56:59] churches throughout all ages Behold Him
[57:01] who was the same yesterday today and
[57:02] forever and who never changes neither in
[57:05] essence or in his ways um where two or
[57:07] three are gathered together in his name
[57:09] there he is in their midst and not only
[57:11] in the midst as a complacent onlooker
[57:13] this is what some people think he's just
[57:16] complacently um an onlooker or a
[57:18] recording Angel but there he stands
[57:21] expressing exactly what he is the life
[57:24] and sustain and Giver of all gifts to
[57:26] the church hallelujah amen so he is our
[57:29] life and our
[57:30] sustainer praise God hallelujah I'm so
[57:33] thankful that he is my life and my
[57:34] sustainer I'm not sustaining myself I'm
[57:37] not keeping on this Pilgrim journey by
[57:39] My Own Strength but it's God keeps us on
[57:41] the straight and
[57:43] narrow hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[57:46] Lord
[57:47] now there's many things that the we know
[57:50] you know I just want to deal with one
[57:51] thing before we go back to um him being
[57:55] our high priest now because he had to
[57:57] carry you know there's that song that we
[58:00] um tried to sing last Sunday that we
[58:01] used to sing a while ago living he loved
[58:03] me dying he saved me buried he carried
[58:05] my sins far away Rising he justified me
[58:07] freely forever one day is coming a
[58:09] glorious day so now in the Old Testament
[58:12] because we know that the um uh the
[58:14] Apostle Paul would say the law was a
[58:15] shadow of good things to come so all the
[58:18] all the sacrific in the Old Testament
[58:19] pointed to Jesus Christ and we can get a
[58:22] greater understanding of what he has
[58:24] done in real form when we look back into
[58:26] the shadow now during the time of
[58:29] atonement once a year the high priest
[58:31] would go and with the blood and sprinkle
[58:32] The Mercy Seat now this could only be
[58:35] done by the high priest it could not be
[58:36] done by any other it could not be done
[58:39] by any other priest it could not be it
[58:42] was only the high priest that could do
[58:43] it now he had the privilege of going
[58:47] once in a year into the holy of holies
[58:48] to sprinkle the blood I mean of the
[58:51] bulock and you know you know upon the
[58:52] mercy seat and this was for this was for
[58:56] the sins of the people now only he could
[58:58] do this didn't matter how good or moral
[59:00] we were just say if we're back there you
[59:02] know you know during the Old Testament
[59:03] time we could have the most outstanding
[59:05] family you know never put a foot wrong
[59:07] sincerely love the Lord not you know
[59:10] it's not a family tradition but a
[59:11] genuine love for God you know loving him
[59:14] and all these things but yet even with
[59:16] that we we needed someone to come and
[59:18] atone for our sins and so now the high
[59:21] priest could could go on once a year
[59:23] with the blood and I'm going to read
[59:25] this oh we'll just read this here and he
[59:26] shall um take the blood of the bulock
[59:28] and sprinkle it with his finger upon The
[59:30] Mercy Seat Eastward and before the mercy
[59:32] seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with
[59:34] his finger seven times then shall he
[59:36] kill the goat of the sin offering that
[59:39] is for the people and bring his blood
[59:40] within the veil and do that um and do
[59:43] with that blood as he did with the blood
[59:44] of the bulock and sprinkle it upon the
[59:46] mercy seat and before the mercy seat and
[59:48] he shall make an atonement for the holy
[59:50] place because of the uncleanness of the
[59:51] children of Israel and because of their
[59:53] transgressions and all their sins and so
[59:55] shall he do for the Tabernacle of the
[59:57] congregation that remaineth among them
[59:59] in the midst of their uncleanness and
[1:00:01] there shall be no man in the Tabernacle
[1:00:03] of the congregation when he goes into to
[1:00:04] make an atonement in the Holy place
[1:00:06] until he come out and have gone sorry
[1:00:10] and have made an atonement for himself
[1:00:12] and for his household and for all the
[1:00:14] congregation of Israel so it doesn't
[1:00:16] matter how sincere we were he had to go
[1:00:18] do that job we couldn't we couldn't we
[1:00:20] couldn't offer the blood on our own
[1:00:22] behalf but a but a high priest had to
[1:00:24] and do that now we know that the
[1:00:27] levitical high priest was just a fallen
[1:00:30] man that was just put into a high priest
[1:00:31] but now we have a high priest Which is
[1:00:33] far greater than that amen that it's not
[1:00:35] just a you know a man in an office that
[1:00:38] comes and goes and changes but we have a
[1:00:40] high priest that abides continually the
[1:00:41] Son of God who maketh for who who ever
[1:00:44] liveth to maketh intercessions for us
[1:00:47] amen so now there was so so there was
[1:00:49] one part of it was that he had to go and
[1:00:52] and and and give the offering on behalf
[1:00:54] of the children of Israel but now he
[1:00:57] also but then also in this is there
[1:00:59] there was there was two goats one of the
[1:01:02] goats we read about was killed for the
[1:01:04] sin offering but then there's the other
[1:01:06] one was the was the uh what we call the
[1:01:09] scapegoat and so now Lots would be cast
[1:01:13] to which goat would be the goat given
[1:01:15] for sin and the other one would be the
[1:01:16] scapegoat now the scapegoat would carry
[1:01:18] the sins of the people into the
[1:01:20] Wilderness now we know these all
[1:01:22] represented Jesus Christ okay so in the
[1:01:24] old there was there was a scapegoat
[1:01:27] there was a sin offering goat there was
[1:01:28] the high priest there was The Mercy Seat
[1:01:30] they're all separate things right but
[1:01:32] Jesus Christ was all these things he is
[1:01:34] our offering he is our high priest he is
[1:01:37] The Mercy Seat he is the scapegoat
[1:01:39] remember because the devil is not the
[1:01:40] scapegoat the devil has no part in
[1:01:42] Redemption right he has no part in this
[1:01:45] no this is all Jesus Christ being
[1:01:47] reflected and so he had to so this so
[1:01:50] Aaron would um lay both his hands upon
[1:01:52] his head of the live goat and confess
[1:01:54] over him all the iniquities of the
[1:01:56] children of Israel and all their
[1:01:57] transgressions and all their sins and
[1:01:59] putting them upon the head of the goat
[1:02:01] and he shall send them away at the hand
[1:02:03] of a fit man Into the Wilderness and the
[1:02:05] Goat shall bear upon him all their
[1:02:07] iniquities unto a land not inhabited and
[1:02:09] he shall let the goat uh let go the goat
[1:02:12] in the wilderness am mean to dying he
[1:02:14] carried our sins far away amen so so
[1:02:17] this goat had to be placed be led Away
[1:02:19] by hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness
[1:02:22] and this is so that when that when that
[1:02:24] goat was taken into that Wilderness
[1:02:25] place the man could get away from the
[1:02:27] goat that the goat couldn't follow him
[1:02:29] back you know was this wasn't an unfit
[1:02:31] man or someone who could be followed but
[1:02:32] it had to be one who was fit now Jesus
[1:02:35] when he was he was he was you could say
[1:02:37] in a way he was well he was forsaken on
[1:02:40] Calvary where he would cry out my God my
[1:02:42] God why is Thou forsaken me because he
[1:02:44] was manifesting being our scapegoat who
[1:02:47] knows you know who's heard oh that
[1:02:49] person's a scapegoat this all the blames
[1:02:51] on that person and see now many times
[1:02:53] the scapegoat Among Us is someone who
[1:02:56] they don't they just made the scapegoat
[1:02:58] but Jesus was willingly our scapegoat
[1:03:01] because he knew that our sins and our
[1:03:02] iniquities had to be carried far away
[1:03:04] they had to be taken from us as far as
[1:03:06] the east as from the west and so and so
[1:03:09] he was he was led into a Wilderness and
[1:03:11] what was that Wilderness he was led into
[1:03:13] he he with all of our sins and
[1:03:16] iniquities upon Him took them to hell I
[1:03:19] mean so he so so he took them at a place
[1:03:21] not inhabited by man I mean that man
[1:03:23] shouldn't dwell in right so they were
[1:03:25] carried far away now this goat this goat
[1:03:28] was had to be had to be abandoned and
[1:03:30] you could say he was abandoned that day
[1:03:32] on Calvary where he says my father wise
[1:03:34] th forsaken me and so he carried them
[1:03:36] far away now I'm so thankful he did this
[1:03:39] for us amen he didn't just put them in a
[1:03:42] you know somewhere that could be could
[1:03:43] be gotten by us no he carried them far
[1:03:45] away that all of our because remember
[1:03:48] the atonement wasn't just for the for
[1:03:50] the Salvation of our souls it was for
[1:03:52] healing of the body amen so he carried
[1:03:54] all of our sins our iniquities all of
[1:03:56] our guilt our shame he carried them all
[1:03:58] far away Hallelujah so that that that we
[1:04:01] don't bear them no more amen because he
[1:04:04] was wounded for our transgressions he
[1:04:06] was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:04:07] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:04:09] and with the stripes we are healed all
[1:04:12] we like sheep have gone astray we have
[1:04:13] turned everyone to his own way and the
[1:04:16] lord has laid on him the iniquity of us
[1:04:18] all he was oppressed and he was
[1:04:20] afflicted I mean Afflicted yet he opened
[1:04:23] not his mouth he is brought as a sheep
[1:04:24] to the slaughter and as a sheep before
[1:04:27] her shears is dumb so he openeth not his
[1:04:30] mouth hallelujah hallelujah so he
[1:04:32] carried our sins far away amen so he
[1:04:35] didn't just heal us but he but he but he
[1:04:38] dealt with our sin amen so the sin
[1:04:39] question is over in God's mind when he
[1:04:42] was on Calvary he said it is finished in
[1:04:44] his mind I've paid this in full this is
[1:04:47] not an interest payment this is not just
[1:04:48] a part payment this is not a you know
[1:04:50] those kind of things it was paid in full
[1:04:52] that day on Calvary so now if the sin
[1:04:54] question is finished in his mind I pray
[1:04:57] it's finished in your mind that that
[1:05:00] that your sin question has that been
[1:05:01] answered by the blood of Jesus Christ I
[1:05:04] mean you're no longer wrestling with
[1:05:05] that have I been forgiven have I been
[1:05:07] redeemed is this Blood more than enough
[1:05:10] I trust in your own mind that's been
[1:05:12] settled amen I really pray that that
[1:05:14] with all my heart and and and if it
[1:05:16] hasn't I pray this would be the service
[1:05:17] where we realize Jesus Paid It all and
[1:05:20] all to him I owe amen I was sin left its
[1:05:23] guilty stain but he made me white as
[1:05:25] snow Hallelujah I trust amen that's just
[1:05:28] how it is amen so Hallelujah so in the
[1:05:30] scriptures in the Old Testament I just
[1:05:32] like this one at the sin offering when
[1:05:33] they got two goats these goats Jesus
[1:05:35] represented both of them or they
[1:05:37] represented him rather one goat was
[1:05:39] killed the other was the sins of the
[1:05:40] Nations was placed I mean sin of the
[1:05:42] nation was placed upon this goat called
[1:05:44] the scapegoat and that goat had to go
[1:05:46] out into the Wilderness to die and to be
[1:05:48] out there alone among the beasts and so
[1:05:50] forth Jesus uh had to be that goat I
[1:05:53] want you to notice he was a lamb he was
[1:05:55] a sheep but he was made a goat for you
[1:05:57] and I praise God and we being a goat
[1:06:00] might become sheep we being Sinners
[1:06:03] guilty of death subject to death and all
[1:06:05] sold out under condemnation yet Christ
[1:06:08] became me that I through his grace might
[1:06:10] become him a Son of God seated at the
[1:06:12] right hand of God in Glory Hallelujah
[1:06:16] now amen but we know he didn't just do
[1:06:19] that but he rose triumphant over hell
[1:06:20] death in the grave amen so when he
[1:06:22] ascended and Mary was at the the tomb
[1:06:24] Jesus told her don't touch me cuz I've
[1:06:27] not ascended yet to my father and your
[1:06:29] father my God and your God Amen so he
[1:06:31] offered himself up up in glory came back
[1:06:34] down then he said to the his disciples
[1:06:36] touch me he even said to Thomas put your
[1:06:38] hand in my side in these things and yeah
[1:06:40] but now he's ascended and he is our high
[1:06:42] priest now God has always I put it this
[1:06:46] way he's always been the high priest of
[1:06:48] his word I mean he's always been alive
[1:06:52] to manifest his word in the lives of the
[1:06:55] Believers you see now because tied in
[1:06:58] with the with the with the scapegoat and
[1:07:01] with the high priest making an atonement
[1:07:04] was the Year of
[1:07:05] Jubilee so now carrying carrying the PE
[1:07:10] you know making atonement for the people
[1:07:12] now had an action in their lives yeah
[1:07:15] where it wasn't just I'm a forgiven and
[1:07:17] go back to my old
[1:07:19] life because those who were in slavery
[1:07:22] Who Sold themselves into slavery in in
[1:07:24] Israel when the atonement was made it
[1:07:27] wasn't just that their sins were atoned
[1:07:29] for but they could go back to their
[1:07:31] possession amen they go they could go
[1:07:34] back to the place they fell from amen so
[1:07:36] their inheritance that God had given
[1:07:38] them in the beginning they could return
[1:07:40] to and so now this is exactly what
[1:07:42] happens here when you know after seven
[1:07:45] sabbaths there's a 50-year jubilee you
[1:07:47] know I mean the 50th year is the Jubilee
[1:07:49] then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the
[1:07:50] Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the
[1:07:52] seventh month this is the day of Aton at
[1:07:54] which is we just read about there in the
[1:07:56] day of atonement shall you make the
[1:07:57] trumpet sound throughout all your land
[1:07:59] and you shall Hollow the 50th year and
[1:08:02] Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land
[1:08:04] unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[1:08:05] shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[1:08:07] shall return every man unto his
[1:08:09] possession and you shall return every
[1:08:11] man un his family amen so now there is a
[1:08:13] power tied with the atonement to restore
[1:08:16] everyone back to their possession that
[1:08:19] they fell from and to return every man
[1:08:21] unto his family now now we're not living
[1:08:24] in Israel we're not under the blood of
[1:08:25] bulls and goats right so this is not us
[1:08:27] returning to a pastle of ground as in a
[1:08:30] place in Palestine no but we have been
[1:08:32] returned back to our true land which is
[1:08:34] the word of God me back to the promises
[1:08:37] of God we're no longer worshiping under
[1:08:40] a denominational idea but we've come
[1:08:42] back to the full word of God we've come
[1:08:44] back to our inheritance amen because
[1:08:46] every promise of God Is Ours I mean so
[1:08:49] we have returned back to the baptism of
[1:08:51] the Holy Ghost so this was the power of
[1:08:54] Calvary now was not just to release us
[1:08:56] of our sins but to restore us back to
[1:08:58] what we fell from because we know when
[1:09:01] God thought of us before the foundation
[1:09:03] of the world he did not think of us as
[1:09:05] downtrodden
[1:09:07] brokenhearted uh under the Yoke of sin
[1:09:10] you know subject to sin nature defeated
[1:09:13] people he never thought of us that way
[1:09:15] he saw us in His image amen he saw us
[1:09:18] Made In His Image washed in his blood
[1:09:21] amen because we got to realize that
[1:09:23] before the evil ever ever was created by
[1:09:26] God Amen God made a way for for his
[1:09:29] people to be restored see before there
[1:09:30] was anything God was alone with his
[1:09:33] thoughts amen and he doesn't change his
[1:09:35] thinking like we do his when he thinks
[1:09:38] about something it's perfect amen it's
[1:09:41] perfect amen so when so when he thinks
[1:09:43] something and then he speaks it amen
[1:09:45] it's going to become material so his his
[1:09:47] thinking cannot change amen so if he
[1:09:49] loved you he loved you amen if he loved
[1:09:52] you he loved you amen he can't change
[1:09:53] change his love amen he cannot see now
[1:09:56] but we we think you know our love is a
[1:09:59] different kind of a love see the love of
[1:10:01] God is far greater than human love see
[1:10:03] human love is based on how you treat me
[1:10:05] I'll treat
[1:10:06] you you're good to me you scratch my
[1:10:08] back I'll scratch yours kind of thing
[1:10:10] you know you're good to me I'm good to
[1:10:12] you but God's love is far greater than
[1:10:14] that amen because remember when we were
[1:10:16] his enemy he loved us and died for us I
[1:10:19] mean when we were actually his enemy you
[1:10:20] know people who are not converted are
[1:10:22] actually fighting on the wrong team
[1:10:24] amen but when God comes their way they
[1:10:26] realize hey I'm actually on the wrong
[1:10:28] team here amen and they give their lives
[1:10:30] and then God Amen reveals to them who
[1:10:33] they really are that they are part of
[1:10:34] him amen so all that dwell upon the
[1:10:37] Earth shall worship him now this is the
[1:10:38] Beast this is quite a big mouthful when
[1:10:40] you think about the multitude that he's
[1:10:41] talking about whose names are not
[1:10:43] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[1:10:44] sland from the foundation of the world
[1:10:46] and I just put this next verse I thought
[1:10:48] if any man have an ear let him here amen
[1:10:51] so so that's not all that's not phys IAL
[1:10:53] is that's spiritual hearing so if anyone
[1:10:56] has the spiritual ability to hear Let
[1:10:58] Them hear what the spirit is saying so
[1:11:00] everyone will dwell shall worship the
[1:11:02] Beast whose names are not written in the
[1:11:04] Lamb's Book of Life which is I mean of
[1:11:06] the Lamb which is sland from the
[1:11:08] foundation of the world am mean so
[1:11:10] before there ever was anything created
[1:11:12] the lamb was slain in the mind of God
[1:11:14] Amen and he wrote your name in his blood
[1:11:16] on his book amen and now if he's written
[1:11:19] your name in heaven Amen in the Lamb's
[1:11:21] Book of Life your name can't be blotted
[1:11:23] out amen you it's impossible for it to
[1:11:26] be blotted out amen the devil don't have
[1:11:28] enough rubbing compound to get your name
[1:11:30] off that book Hallelujah now I'm not
[1:11:32] talking about the book of life I'm
[1:11:33] talking about the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:11:35] amen so now if our names are written in
[1:11:37] the Lamb's Book of Life now we know a
[1:11:39] name represents a life you think of
[1:11:42] Moses you think about what he did Elijah
[1:11:44] what he did Jesus what he did Paul what
[1:11:46] he did because the name represent a life
[1:11:48] so now when our names were written down
[1:11:50] there God was thinking of a life amen
[1:11:53] now he's not thinking about our natural
[1:11:55] life amen remember he knew the character
[1:11:57] we have he knew he knew how short tall
[1:11:59] skinny round whatever whatever you know
[1:12:02] characteristics he he knew all those
[1:12:03] things and he pre-planned you'd be made
[1:12:05] exactly how you're made if you're noisy
[1:12:08] he wanted you noisy if you're quiet he
[1:12:10] wanted you quiet if you're in between
[1:12:12] somewhere he wanted you in the between I
[1:12:14] mean he made you how he wanted you to be
[1:12:16] made if he wanted you to be a different
[1:12:18] person he would have made you with a
[1:12:19] different personality amen so we just
[1:12:21] got to be comfortable on our own skin
[1:12:23] talking to myself a lot right
[1:12:25] now we just got to be happy thank you me
[1:12:28] I I remember was it Bible in schools at
[1:12:30] primary school we saying thank you
[1:12:31] Father for making me me you know and
[1:12:34] sometimes you get older you think uh yes
[1:12:36] thank you Lord you know but we God made
[1:12:39] us how he wanted us to be praise the
[1:12:42] Lord I'm glad you know CU God is a god
[1:12:44] of variety amen he's not a cookie cut of
[1:12:46] God that makes us all the same we don't
[1:12:48] have to conform to someone else's
[1:12:49] personality to be a Christian no we're
[1:12:51] got to be ourselves and God wants us to
[1:12:53] be ourselves amen cuz he CU he made you
[1:12:56] exactly how he wanted you to be made no
[1:12:59] but that's not just the part he was
[1:13:00] thinking about he's thinking of that
[1:13:02] part of himself he deposited in you
[1:13:04] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:13:06] that when the word came your way you
[1:13:08] would recognize your name is in his book
[1:13:10] Hallelujah that that and now that's the
[1:13:12] god part amen that would come to life
[1:13:14] that seed that would come to expression
[1:13:16] am me when the Holy Ghost falls upon it
[1:13:18] amen so so so he thought of you before
[1:13:21] the devil was ever made amen he thought
[1:13:23] of you and made a way for you to
[1:13:25] overcome the devil before the devil ever
[1:13:27] became the devil I mean when when when
[1:13:29] Lucifer was actually not proud in his
[1:13:33] position doing what God made him to do
[1:13:36] the Lord had already made a way to
[1:13:37] overcome that guy amen hallelujah before
[1:13:41] amen so so now so if God has seen Us
[1:13:43] Victorious before amen time ever came or
[1:13:46] sin ever came into existence amen then
[1:13:48] nothing in time can stop what God has
[1:13:50] done in eternity amen nothing can stop
[1:13:53] amen doesn't matter the obstacles we
[1:13:56] face those are actually immaterial those
[1:13:59] don't matter amen we're not looking at
[1:14:00] obstacles we're looking at what God has
[1:14:02] done for us am mean that that is always
[1:14:04] the main factor in everything should be
[1:14:06] but God rich in Mercy amen but God rich
[1:14:09] in Mercy he's the one that matters he's
[1:14:11] the he's the change maker amen he's the
[1:14:13] Difference Maker is our God so before
[1:14:15] there was ever any evil any sin any
[1:14:18] pride in the heart of the devil before
[1:14:19] he ascended and you know did all he did
[1:14:22] the lamb was slam before the foundation
[1:14:24] of the world Amen so so before any
[1:14:27] Angels fell the lamb was slam before the
[1:14:29] foundation of the world and God put your
[1:14:31] name on his book amen hallelujah I think
[1:14:33] that's I think it's a wonderful thing
[1:14:36] amen I think yeah yeah I think it's a
[1:14:38] wonderful thing cuz when you realize
[1:14:39] that your name is written there in the
[1:14:40] Lamb's Book of Life you realize you
[1:14:42] didn't become a Believer haphazardly I
[1:14:44] mean you did not give your life to the
[1:14:45] Lord just just out of a it was
[1:14:47] circumstantial no it was beyond
[1:14:49] circumstance it was predestination am me
[1:14:52] when you receed the Holy Ghost you
[1:14:53] realize it wasn't just a it you know it
[1:14:56] wasn't a stab in the dark or wonder
[1:14:57] what's going to happen kind of think no
[1:14:58] you received the Holy Ghost because you
[1:15:00] are a son or daughter of God I mean as
[1:15:02] it says in the book of Galatians because
[1:15:04] you are Sons you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:15:06] so you know we don't become Sons by the
[1:15:08] new birth but because of the new birth
[1:15:10] we manifest who we really are amen
[1:15:13] hallelujah that makes me happy oh amen
[1:15:15] so now we can we can Rejoice this
[1:15:17] morning because we got to realize that
[1:15:18] whatever we're facing amen God already
[1:15:21] made a way to overcome it God already
[1:15:23] made a way to go through it amen Lord
[1:15:25] and so if we can if we can look into
[1:15:28] this now you know I like this I was just
[1:15:31] think about this phrase here in verse 9
[1:15:33] but we're just going to read all this I
[1:15:34] mean I just love the book of Hebrews it
[1:15:36] puts God in his place it puts the devil
[1:15:39] in his place and it puts you in your
[1:15:42] place and I think that's good I'm glad
[1:15:44] I'm not in the devil's place this
[1:15:45] morning
[1:15:47] Hallelujah thou H has put all things in
[1:15:49] subjection under his feet for in that he
[1:15:52] put all in subjection under him he left
[1:15:54] nothing that is not put under him but
[1:15:57] now we see not yet all things put under
[1:15:59] him why because death is still here okay
[1:16:01] but we see Jesus I thought that's a real
[1:16:03] good that's a real good phrase you know
[1:16:05] whatever you're going through in life I
[1:16:07] trust no matter the problem the
[1:16:08] circumstances the questions the clouds
[1:16:11] of doubt and trouble he say but I see
[1:16:13] Jesus amen that he is working in my
[1:16:15] circumstances he's working in my trouble
[1:16:18] amen that should be the main thing but
[1:16:20] we see Jesus like the Apostle Paul's in
[1:16:22] the dungeon but saw Jesus amen he
[1:16:24] received the revelations of most of the
[1:16:26] New Testament you know he's there in the
[1:16:27] storm the boats going up and down they
[1:16:29] think they're all going to drown but he
[1:16:30] saw Jesus am amen why because he had
[1:16:33] Revelation that he's going to Rome and
[1:16:35] now we know we have Revelation we're
[1:16:36] going to glory amen amen but I trusted
[1:16:38] in every see the devil loves to Cloud
[1:16:40] things over amen but it doesn't matter
[1:16:42] how clouded it gets you got to realize
[1:16:44] that we have an anchor within the veil
[1:16:46] Christ Alone our Cornerstone I thought
[1:16:48] that's such a fitting song brother Isaac
[1:16:50] amen the songs we sung this morning amen
[1:16:52] that it doesn't matter how bad things
[1:16:54] get I trust you can say but I see Jesus
[1:16:56] he say I can't see him in the
[1:16:57] circumstance look beyond the
[1:16:59] circumstance amen God is in control who
[1:17:02] is made a little lower than the angels
[1:17:04] for the suffering of death crowned with
[1:17:06] Glory and Honor that he might by the
[1:17:08] grace of God should taste death for
[1:17:10] every man for it became whom for whom
[1:17:12] are all things and by who by whom are
[1:17:15] all things and bringing many sons unto
[1:17:17] glory to make the cap of their salvation
[1:17:20] perfect through sufferings both he that
[1:17:22] sanctified and they who are Sanctified
[1:17:24] are all of one for which cause he not
[1:17:26] ashamed to call them Brethren amen
[1:17:30] sometimes we're ashamed to call
[1:17:31] ourselves you know we're ashamed of
[1:17:33] ourselves God's not ashamed of you
[1:17:36] amen praise the Lord he's not ashamed to
[1:17:38] say Yep they're part of my family
[1:17:42] they're part of me
[1:17:44] Hallelujah that doesn't mean we just
[1:17:46] wait off into sin and you know do all
[1:17:48] those things no we repent say Lord I
[1:17:49] want to be more like you change me Lord
[1:17:51] but you know he's not ashamed of us us
[1:17:53] amen he made a way amen for us to be
[1:17:56] made in His image now if we can just if
[1:18:00] we just really focus in on you know how
[1:18:02] how God does all things well you know
[1:18:06] he's not a distant God but he's here as
[1:18:10] I said now if he has if he has tasted
[1:18:13] death for every man so so so the S
[1:18:17] questions over now we also believe that
[1:18:20] the power is here to return us to our
[1:18:22] possession
[1:18:23] you know and I know I'm not preaching
[1:18:25] something that's foreign to any of us
[1:18:27] we've all experienced I trust this the
[1:18:29] saving grace of God that took you from
[1:18:32] the shackles of sin and death of
[1:18:35] unbelief and skepticism and all these
[1:18:37] things and raised us above those things
[1:18:39] I mean what's happening now a Liberation
[1:18:41] has come into your life and it wasn't
[1:18:42] you trying to break the shackles God
[1:18:44] came and broke the shackles I mean sure
[1:18:47] you've got to hate the sin that's
[1:18:49] captured you you've got to hate it I
[1:18:51] mean if you love anything of your old
[1:18:52] life chances are you'll turn back to it
[1:18:55] but if you hate that thing then God can
[1:18:56] break it off you completely Hallelujah
[1:18:59] so now so so so he's done this right so
[1:19:01] now if he started he's going to finish I
[1:19:04] mean so so a man in the Old Testament
[1:19:06] that was a slave when he heard that
[1:19:07] Jubilee trumpet he realized the
[1:19:09] atonements been made I can go back to my
[1:19:12] possession now he didn't just drop
[1:19:14] whatever Farm tool he was using and walk
[1:19:16] out of the field he didn't just walk out
[1:19:18] of the field and go down to the road no
[1:19:20] he walked all the way home it could have
[1:19:23] been a long journey back from his
[1:19:24] purchase but you know from his
[1:19:26] inheritance I don't know but the fact is
[1:19:28] the sound of that trumpet caused him to
[1:19:30] walk home amen and now we have heard the
[1:19:33] Jubilee trumpet the gospel trumpet amen
[1:19:35] where Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:19:37] hearing the word of God right and so now
[1:19:39] faith has come into our lives and we
[1:19:41] realize that we do not belong in this
[1:19:43] culture we do not belong to be ruled by
[1:19:46] sin nature amen but God the power of the
[1:19:49] blood can take some nature out of our
[1:19:51] lives where once we used to wa made in
[1:19:53] sin and love the things of the world but
[1:19:54] now our appetites Changed by him that
[1:19:57] all we really want is him amen even if
[1:19:59] we're tempted there's something within
[1:20:00] us saying Lord lead me not into
[1:20:02] temptation Lord I don't want to do this
[1:20:04] thing change my nature Lord hallelujah
[1:20:07] so amen so so he went all the way back
[1:20:09] home amen because of the sound of that
[1:20:11] trumpet
[1:20:12] hallelujah hallelujah now hallelujah
[1:20:16] amen God is working in our lives amen I
[1:20:19] know we know that because you can say
[1:20:21] yes Lord you're working Jesus hallelujah
[1:20:24] amen so now but we got to realize that
[1:20:26] the love of God as I said before is not
[1:20:28] is not like human love it's not
[1:20:30] conditional love amen no but his love is
[1:20:32] shown in his calling his election yeah
[1:20:36] amen because you know it would ask in um
[1:20:39] you know uh Malachi Israel would ask in
[1:20:42] the Book of Malachi you know how do we
[1:20:43] know God loves us and he says well Jacob
[1:20:45] I've love and Esau you know have I hated
[1:20:47] so his love is shown in election in
[1:20:50] calling now you see they cannot figure F
[1:20:52] out God's love and many times this
[1:20:54] confuses us because you know we think
[1:20:56] that you know you know our you know
[1:20:59] God's love for us should be like a like
[1:21:01] a baby with parental care you know you
[1:21:03] don't want your children to go through
[1:21:06] anything okay some some parents let
[1:21:10] they're anyway no we don't want them to
[1:21:11] suffer harm we don't like it when they
[1:21:13] get hurt you know we want to keep them
[1:21:15] from those things and then and then when
[1:21:17] God allows us to go through trials and
[1:21:19] sickness and hardship we begin to
[1:21:21] question well where are you God I
[1:21:23] thought you loved me I thought you'd
[1:21:24] keep me from these things but no his
[1:21:27] love is not shown that way his love is
[1:21:29] shown by his
[1:21:30] election amen amen see see they thought
[1:21:33] see many people think that the love was
[1:21:35] like a baby with parental care but God
[1:21:37] said that his love was elective love the
[1:21:40] proof of his God uh proof of his love is
[1:21:42] election no matter what happened his
[1:21:45] love was proven truly by the fact that
[1:21:47] chosen under salvation because God ha
[1:21:49] chosen you to Salvation through
[1:21:51] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:21:52] of the the truth he may commit you to
[1:21:54] death as he did Paul amen he may commit
[1:21:56] you to suffering as he did job that is
[1:21:59] his prerogative he is Sovereign but it's
[1:22:01] all with a purpose amen I pray that we
[1:22:03] could see the purpose of God in our
[1:22:05] lives am mean that we could see Lord
[1:22:07] you're doing something for a reason now
[1:22:09] he doesn't have to you know we don't
[1:22:10] have stand stand up meetings who's had a
[1:22:13] stand up meeting every day at work we're
[1:22:15] doing this today you know he doesn't NE
[1:22:18] sure we have a stand up well we have a
[1:22:20] kneel down meeting yo y pray to the Lord
[1:22:23] but he doesn't tell us everything we're
[1:22:24] going to go through in the day he's
[1:22:26] going to say now you're actually going
[1:22:27] to have lunch at this time and this is
[1:22:28] going to happen here and you're have a
[1:22:30] car crash here and you know all these
[1:22:32] sicknesses going to come here no he
[1:22:33] doesn't tell us those things amen right
[1:22:35] but we've got to just realize that Lord
[1:22:38] everything's for a purpose even the
[1:22:40] mundane of the Monday to Friday or
[1:22:43] whatever you you you know many times we
[1:22:44] just think we're just going through a
[1:22:46] cycle of a rinse and repeat kind of a
[1:22:48] life but God is working in that
[1:22:50] Hallelujah I'm glad he's working in our
[1:22:52] lives amen
[1:22:53] am amen but it's all with a purpose if
[1:22:56] he did not have a purpose then he would
[1:22:57] be the author of frustration and not of
[1:22:59] Peace his purpose is that after you have
[1:23:01] suffered a while you may that um we
[1:23:04] would be made perfect be established
[1:23:06] strengthened and settled Hallelujah I
[1:23:08] like that maybe I think I've used that
[1:23:09] quote quite a lot but you know I like
[1:23:11] that kind of thing you know after we've
[1:23:12] suffered a while we'll be made perfect
[1:23:14] be established what are we being
[1:23:15] established and that his word is true am
[1:23:18] mean that he loves us with an unfailing
[1:23:19] love that God is in control of Our Lives
[1:23:21] he you the Bible says that he puts in
[1:23:23] the hearts of men to fulfill his word
[1:23:26] and that's not even just talking about
[1:23:27] Christians that's actually everyone so
[1:23:28] people get upset at the government
[1:23:29] they're all getting already up in arms
[1:23:31] about the election now and of course in
[1:23:33] you know you know in America God will
[1:23:35] have who he wants in those offices right
[1:23:38] to fulfill his word you know people
[1:23:40] think they've got an agenda what they
[1:23:41] want to do no God has a plan amen and
[1:23:44] whatever God wants to do he's going to
[1:23:46] have it done am mean you say well then
[1:23:48] what is the point of us you know
[1:23:50] witnessing and and and and living for
[1:23:52] him and praying pray in these things
[1:23:53] because remember the model prayer was
[1:23:56] thy will be done on Earth as is is in
[1:23:59] heaven you know most of prayer should be
[1:24:01] Lord change my thinking to match your
[1:24:03] thinking that you that that I'd be at
[1:24:05] the right place at the right time say
[1:24:07] the right thing do the right thing to be
[1:24:08] a witness I mean because God wants an
[1:24:10] expression he must have an expression
[1:24:12] upon the Earth the devil sure has an
[1:24:14] expression in this day amen and we know
[1:24:16] God has an expression too amen he is
[1:24:18] living through his children Hallelujah
[1:24:21] he's living through you and I amen so we
[1:24:23] can trust you we can just have such
[1:24:24] confidence that whatever's going on
[1:24:27] right now God is in control God has
[1:24:29] allowed it that his word would be
[1:24:30] fulfilled amen and so we can press him
[1:24:33] with confidence saying Lord you're
[1:24:34] active in the Affairs of the world
[1:24:36] nothing's out of your control you're
[1:24:39] allowing things to happen so now Lord
[1:24:41] may we press in and and get every
[1:24:43] promise amen hallelujah why because he
[1:24:47] wants his purposes he wants to prove
[1:24:50] himself in your trouble amen amen his
[1:24:52] purpose if we can see his purpose in our
[1:24:55] lives like that praise God you mean Lord
[1:24:58] you've allowed this to happen that you
[1:25:00] can prove yourself absolutely praise God
[1:25:03] this is awesome thank you Lord I'm so
[1:25:05] glad you you want to prove yourself you
[1:25:07] don't want to prove my Humanity you want
[1:25:09] to prove your deity amen prove your word
[1:25:12] amen so I'm so thankful we can
[1:25:14] Hallelujah we can just say Lord prove
[1:25:16] yourself Show Yourself amen even even
[1:25:19] when it seems like the outcome is not
[1:25:21] the outcome we want Lord as long as your
[1:25:23] will is done am amen hallelujah
[1:25:26] hallelujah am brother we talk about when
[1:25:28] he was um watching Eagles and eaglets
[1:25:30] and so on he said about a big mama eagle
[1:25:32] takes the Eagles down to the green
[1:25:34] grassy Fields goes up into the mountains

[1:26:27] has the final say Amen it ain't over
[1:26:30] till God says it's over amen so it ain't
[1:26:33] over till God says it's over amen so the
[1:26:34] devil says it's over but he don't know
[1:26:37] amen God knows all things that's right
[1:26:39] amen and old mother was sitting up there
[1:26:41] watching them I thought well praise be
[1:26:42] to God that's right he taken them out of
[1:26:44] the nest of the world he climbed up the
[1:26:46] ramp parts of Glory sitting on high
[1:26:47] watching over his Heritage to see that
[1:26:49] no harm comes what's that harm he's
[1:26:51] talking about the harm of the Soul yeah
[1:26:54] Hallelujah remember he will keep the
[1:26:56] faith you know Paul said I've kept the
[1:26:58] faith but what was keeping the faith in
[1:26:59] him God in him remember it's not if we
[1:27:02] hold on to Jesus that matters it's
[1:27:04] whether he holds on to us amen as long
[1:27:06] as I feel his big hand around mine I'll
[1:27:10] keep
[1:27:10] walking hallelujah amen praise the lord
[1:27:14] well praise be to God that's right amen
[1:27:16] I thought if a Cody would start towards
[1:27:18] one of those legals she' flog him to
[1:27:20] death I thought that's right let Satan
[1:27:22] take after a Believer he's got Jesus
[1:27:24] Christ on his hands amen that's right
[1:27:26] sickness comes into your life make it
[1:27:28] feel real unwelcome amen start to praise
[1:27:30] God trouble comes in I mean there's a
[1:27:33] there's a fussing spirit away from the
[1:27:35] house make it feel real unwelcome
[1:27:37] Worship the Lord love the Lord love one
[1:27:39] another a soft answer turns away wrath
[1:27:42] you know just just just make the devil
[1:27:43] feel real unwelcome yes sir
[1:27:46] hallelujah amen so remember now looking
[1:27:49] unto Jesus the author and finisher of
[1:27:51] our faith my amen who is for the joy
[1:27:53] they will sit before him endure the
[1:27:54] cross despising the shame is sit down at
[1:27:56] the right hand of the Throne of God Amen
[1:27:58] so he's the author and he's the finisher
[1:28:01] amen so now what he started so the one
[1:28:03] so so this is just the um definition of
[1:28:06] the author so he's the chief leader he's
[1:28:09] the one who takes the lead in anything
[1:28:11] and thus affords an example a
[1:28:13] predecessor in a matter a Pioneer now a
[1:28:16] Pioneer breaks new ground used to be
[1:28:19] Pioneers came here went to Canada
[1:28:21] different countries pioneer would go we
[1:28:22] don't really have any place to P maybe
[1:28:24] the moon they'd say if they go to Mars
[1:28:26] they're pioneering but you know we
[1:28:27] wanted to get to heaven not to a red
[1:28:29] planet anyway but you see our lord Jesus
[1:28:31] was a Pioneer cuz no one ever went into
[1:28:34] death and came out again amen conquering
[1:28:37] death amen hallelujah he you he he has
[1:28:40] gone on before everything we've gone
[1:28:42] through remember he conquered he
[1:28:44] conquered the lust of the flesh the lust
[1:28:46] of the eyes and the pride of life right
[1:28:48] he conquered all those things amen and
[1:28:49] every sin falls under those categories I
[1:28:51] hope I've got got those three right amen
[1:28:53] so you see now he he is pioneered he has
[1:28:56] already led the way amen but he's also
[1:28:58] the finisher of our faith amen so the
[1:29:01] finisher is a completer amen it's to
[1:29:04] it's to finish it's to fulfill it's to
[1:29:06] make perfect amen so he doesn't just
[1:29:08] lead the way and Pioneer and start
[1:29:10] something but he finishes it am mean so
[1:29:12] if he saw you made in His image before
[1:29:14] the foundation of the world like he
[1:29:16] would say to job job where were you when
[1:29:18] I laid the foundations of the world and
[1:29:20] the sons of God the stars of God shouted
[1:29:22] Joy right God's trying to get job to say
[1:29:24] look job look beyond what you see with
[1:29:26] your eyes think beyond what you think
[1:29:29] with your mind and look to where you
[1:29:30] were in the beginning because remember
[1:29:32] he saw job rejoicing he didn't see job
[1:29:35] before the foundation of the world on an
[1:29:37] ash Heep am me that was a very temporal
[1:29:39] experience for job but God was trying to
[1:29:41] get him to see this is my eternal
[1:29:44] expression of who you are
[1:29:46] rejoicing praising me dancing Hallelujah
[1:29:49] free of this burden free of this sin
[1:29:51] free of trouble Hallelujah remember what
[1:29:54] you how you started is how you're going
[1:29:56] to
[1:29:56] finish hallelujah amen if you're in
[1:30:00] God's thinking you are you you made in
[1:30:02] His image washed in his blood redeemed
[1:30:04] right how you start how he thought of
[1:30:06] you is how you're going to be at the end
[1:30:08] as an expression amen hallelujah thank
[1:30:11] you my Lord amen Our God understands all
[1:30:13] trouble amen he understands all
[1:30:16] problems amen but you see now we got to
[1:30:18] have such confidence in him that he is
[1:30:20] more than able Amen to complete what he
[1:30:23] started who believes he started a work
[1:30:24] in now in your life amen if he started
[1:30:27] that work he's going to finish it h in
[1:30:29] spite of you and I and and I said about
[1:30:31] me in spite of me he's going to finish
[1:30:33] the work in spite of this guy you know
[1:30:37] praise the
[1:30:38] Lord hallelujah in spite of me he's
[1:30:40] going to do it amen so he's the author
[1:30:43] and finisher of our faith amen now it's
[1:30:46] interesting when you read Hebrews
[1:30:48] chapter 12 I'm we're not going to go
[1:30:50] through the whole thing but you come to
[1:30:51] the the end of the end of the chapter
[1:30:53] now this is not quite at the end of the
[1:30:54] chapter but now the beginning it says
[1:30:57] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:30:58] finisher our faith or lay aside every
[1:31:00] weight and sin right that's the first
[1:31:01] verse that so easily besets us let's run
[1:31:04] this race with patience look under Jesus
[1:31:06] right and then you come down to the end
[1:31:07] of the chapter of Hebrews chapter 12 and
[1:31:09] then Paul's now saying we have not come
[1:31:11] to Mount Mount Si we're not come to the
[1:31:14] law but we have come to that New
[1:31:16] Jerusalem we've come to Mount Zion right
[1:31:19] we've come to we've come to this place
[1:31:21] amen
[1:31:22] now when you arriving somewhere you
[1:31:24] receive the benefits of that place amen
[1:31:27] right so if you want a tropical holiday
[1:31:29] and you arrive there you're going to
[1:31:31] enjoy the
[1:31:33] sunshine if you're here you won't get
[1:31:35] that I talk about what right but but
[1:31:37] when you arrive somewhere you enjoy the
[1:31:39] benefits of being there amen so now so
[1:31:42] now this is where the this is where um
[1:31:46] God is telling us this is where we have
[1:31:47] arrived amen now maybe maybe I I don't
[1:31:50] have all the verses so let's just go go
[1:31:51] to Hebrews 12 let's just read a little
[1:31:53] bit more of thisall Amen I I I trust you
[1:31:55] know it's like brother Ram says that you
[1:31:57] know my words will fail but his will
[1:32:00] never fail so let's just read his word
[1:32:02] amen amen so Hebrews chapter 12 and then
[1:32:05] we're going to go
[1:32:07] to let's just let's just read from verse
[1:32:09] um 18 because remember the book of
[1:32:12] Hebrews was a book of contrast the blood
[1:32:15] of Jesus is greater than the blood of
[1:32:16] bulls and goats Jesus Christ is a
[1:32:18] greater high priest than than anyone
[1:32:21] from the aric priesthood right you know
[1:32:24] all these contrasts and what the what
[1:32:26] the atonement does all these things you
[1:32:27] know it's far greater than what they
[1:32:29] have come out of he says but for you
[1:32:31] have not come unto the mount that might
[1:32:32] be touched and that burnt with fire nor
[1:32:35] unto the Blackness and darkness and
[1:32:36] Tempest and the sound of a trumpet the
[1:32:38] voice of Words which voice they heard
[1:32:40] entreated that the word should not be
[1:32:42] spoken to them anymore for they pardon
[1:32:45] me for they could not endure that which
[1:32:47] was commanded and for so much as a beast
[1:32:50] touch the mountain it shall be stoned or
[1:32:52] thrust through with a dart and so
[1:32:53] terrible was the sight that Moses said I
[1:32:56] exceedingly fear and Quake he says you
[1:32:58] haven't come there but you have come
[1:33:00] unto Mount Zion amen unto the city of
[1:33:03] the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[1:33:06] and to an an an innumerable company of
[1:33:09] angels amen so there's more for us than
[1:33:11] against us today amen this is you we
[1:33:14] have come where where where Angels dwell
[1:33:17] Where Angels come and anoint our faith
[1:33:19] and join in our worship and amen bring
[1:33:21] us messages and so on to the general
[1:33:24] assembly and Church of the firstborn
[1:33:26] which are written in heaven amen and to
[1:33:29] God the judge of all and to the spirits
[1:33:32] of just men made perfect amen so
[1:33:35] remember God is not just a judge that
[1:33:37] condemns but he's a judge that pardons
[1:33:39] amen Jesus dropped the charges case
[1:33:41] dismiss saved by grace amen amen so so
[1:33:44] he is judged just righteous Glory I'm
[1:33:47] glad he has amen do you believe that
[1:33:49] this morning amen he has judged us right
[1:33:52] and then even the Bible says when we are
[1:33:53] not faithful yet he remaineth faithful
[1:33:56] amen so he is a faithful high priest
[1:33:58] amen am mean so so he has judged Us by
[1:34:01] the blood of Jesus Christ he has judged
[1:34:02] us righteous and say now notice is it
[1:34:05] doesn't say to men made perfect it says
[1:34:08] to the spirits of just men made perfect
[1:34:11] CU these bodies will not be made perfect
[1:34:13] until they're changed right but by the
[1:34:15] blood of Jesus Christ he makes our souls
[1:34:19] sinless amen he makes our spirit's
[1:34:22] perfect he cleanses them out and that's
[1:34:24] why we need the washing of the water of
[1:34:25] the word the devil tries to put things
[1:34:27] in our Spirits complexes pains or just
[1:34:29] things you know but then the word washes
[1:34:31] those things from us you know you come
[1:34:33] in these doors and you feel troubled and
[1:34:35] laiden down and whatever more but then
[1:34:37] you walk out feeling light and happy
[1:34:39] what's happened you've just been washed
[1:34:41] and You Begin sing the songs of Zion
[1:34:43] your mind is all over the place and you
[1:34:44] sing the songs that Amen to that then
[1:34:47] God begins to wash all those troubles
[1:34:48] away amen amen it says now and to Jes
[1:34:51] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[1:34:54] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[1:34:56] speaketh better things than that of Abel
[1:34:59] amen so the so so this is who we've come
[1:35:01] to we haven't come to a natural man
[1:35:03] who's a high priest but we've come to
[1:35:05] Jesus Christ who's the mediator of the
[1:35:07] New Covenant amen he says that the that
[1:35:10] his blood speaketh better things than
[1:35:12] that of Abel amen so notice speaketh as
[1:35:14] in a presentent speaking it's not a past
[1:35:18] like it spoke it's speaking amen amen so
[1:35:21] so his blood is speaking amen now that
[1:35:23] blood is doing far more for us than we
[1:35:26] realize yeah brother Braham said I don't
[1:35:28] have the quote he said you know if God
[1:35:29] just took his hand off me just for a
[1:35:31] little bit I'd be in big trouble so I'm
[1:35:34] sure we're all thankful of God's
[1:35:35] protection in our lives keeping us amen
[1:35:38] because without him we could never stand
[1:35:40] we could never survive this age we'd
[1:35:41] never overcome without him amen but with
[1:35:44] him we can do all things amen we can
[1:35:46] overcome all trouble Hallelujah I'm so
[1:35:48] thankful for that amen amen so this so
[1:35:51] mediator as a go between amen I think it
[1:35:54] was Joby said I wish there was a man or
[1:35:56] you know that you know that could
[1:35:57] basically be a bridge between between
[1:36:00] God and man amen and then we know our
[1:36:02] lord Jesus is that mediator he's our
[1:36:04] goet amen he's our
[1:36:07] reconciler I'm so glad we're reconciled
[1:36:09] I trust you're not an enemy to God today
[1:36:11] you've given your life to him you've
[1:36:12] been you know washed in his blood filled
[1:36:14] with the Holy Ghost amen so you've been
[1:36:16] reconciled to God Amen he's our
[1:36:18] intercessor our mediator so like the
[1:36:19] Bible says there's one mediator between
[1:36:21] God and man that's the man Christ Jesus
[1:36:23] it's not Mary not some Pope not some
[1:36:25] dead Saint somewhere but there's one
[1:36:27] mediator between God and man am mean and
[1:36:29] now that speaketh is is is an action
[1:36:32] word it's a verb now to talk to utter
[1:36:34] words to preach I mean to tell to utter
[1:36:37] I mean so so his blood speaks on our
[1:36:39] behalf now it says here now it speaks
[1:36:43] better things than that of Abel because
[1:36:46] Abel's blood could never speak
[1:36:47] Redemption Abel's blood could never
[1:36:49] speak freedom it could never give a
[1:36:52] jubilee his blood amen but his blood
[1:36:54] could only cry out as God would say to
[1:36:56] Cain the blood of your brother cries out
[1:36:58] from the earth I mean so all could cry
[1:37:01] out was I've been wronged you know
[1:37:03] someone's got to make this right I've
[1:37:04] been murdered my life's been taken from
[1:37:06] me amen but Jesus said no man taketh my
[1:37:09] life I lay it down and I'll raise it
[1:37:11] back up again amen he freely gave his
[1:37:13] life for you and I Hallelujah so now so
[1:37:17] now his blood doesn't cry out revenge or
[1:37:21] to settle scores like Abel's blood did
[1:37:24] but his blood Cries Out amen it cries
[1:37:27] out Redemption amen it cries out amen
[1:37:31] redeemed hallelujah amen amen you see
[1:37:34] now see in the Old Testament sure the
[1:37:37] blood speaks it speaks a better thing
[1:37:39] the Old Testament the blood spoke of
[1:37:41] guilt amen speaking about Abel's blood
[1:37:43] in the New Testament it spoke of
[1:37:45] redemption in the Old Testament it spoke
[1:37:47] of death and sorrow in the New Testament
[1:37:49] it speaks of resurrection and life it
[1:37:51] speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it
[1:37:53] speaks of power it speaks of life it
[1:37:56] speaks of heaven and that same blood
[1:37:57] that was shed on the um upon the ground
[1:38:00] that called out after his dead brother
[1:38:02] or called out after his dead brother
[1:38:03] that killed him the blood of Jesus
[1:38:05] Christ covers all of our sins and speaks
[1:38:07] peace and resurrection and power and
[1:38:10] life and healing and all the Redemptive
[1:38:12] blessings that the blood was shed for it
[1:38:14] speaks for us certainly the blood speaks
[1:38:16] oh my hallelujah amen see Abel was a
[1:38:20] righteous man died he died innocent
[1:38:22] because he was in the way he was in the
[1:38:23] way standing for the real Revelation he
[1:38:25] had he spoke it he cried out the Justice
[1:38:28] blood of Abel cried out against Cain but
[1:38:30] the blood of Jesus Christ not only cried
[1:38:32] out it redeemed amen it speaketh better
[1:38:35] things see it makes you sons and
[1:38:36] daughters that hide you from the wrath
[1:38:38] of God see the blood of Abel could not
[1:38:40] hide Cain but the but the blood of Jesus
[1:38:43] can amen amen hallelujah so so the blood
[1:38:46] still cries Freedom as Brother Andy
[1:38:48] sings amen so the blood still cries
[1:38:50] freedom and it's still crying Freedom
[1:38:52] right now hallelujah it's just as
[1:38:54] powerful as it was when it was on
[1:38:56] Calvary I may be just you may think this
[1:38:58] is very Elementary but I'm blessed by
[1:39:00] these things I'm so thankful we have a
[1:39:02] God that cares a God that stands in the
[1:39:04] Gap amen when we feel that all hell is
[1:39:06] against us he's standing for us amen
[1:39:08] he's the one who's our shield and our
[1:39:10] guide and our protector amen he's the
[1:39:12] one who who because the devil is the
[1:39:14] accuser of the Brethren and he goes up
[1:39:16] before God because he's allowed to and
[1:39:18] he stands there and accuses he you know
[1:39:20] he puts your name and accuses what you
[1:39:23] have done before God and says God they
[1:39:25] did this they sinned here they lied here
[1:39:27] they did this wrong they did this wrong
[1:39:29] because he's trying to get a hold to say
[1:39:30] he's still got claims on you amen but
[1:39:32] the Lord says no but my blood my blood
[1:39:35] has cleansed them my blood is made them
[1:39:37] whole amen that's not a lot of them cuz
[1:39:39] my blood has taken it far away amen you
[1:39:42] may accuse but my blood is more than
[1:39:43] enough Hallelujah that's what his blood
[1:39:45] does for us even now that's why we need
[1:39:48] an intercessor that's why we need a
[1:39:50] mediator amen we need these things amen
[1:39:52] until these bodies are changed we're
[1:39:54] taken off the Earth cuz we're still in
[1:39:56] these amen these mortal bodies
[1:39:59] Hallelujah but remember now part of the
[1:40:02] part of the atonement was that the
[1:40:04] people will return to their possession
[1:40:06] amen so we we are returning back to our
[1:40:08] position in Christ I believe we already
[1:40:10] really are there amen if we realize what
[1:40:12] God has already made us amen we can
[1:40:15] stand because remember now the devil can
[1:40:17] attack our bodies with sickness that
[1:40:19] doesn't take our salvation right the
[1:40:21] devil can attack our minds with mind
[1:40:23] battles and troubles and complexes that
[1:40:25] doesn't change our Salvation right so
[1:40:27] you can be the sickest person in the
[1:40:28] world with the biggest complexes in the
[1:40:30] spirit but if God has met you and sealed
[1:40:32] you into the kingdom amen you've got
[1:40:34] Victory H you know you've got Victory
[1:40:37] see the devil can attack your body he
[1:40:39] can attack your spirit but he can't
[1:40:41] touch that Soul amen that's the Soul's
[1:40:43] the most precious thing amen if that's
[1:40:45] been sealed by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:40:47] covered in the blood it doesn't matter
[1:40:49] what happens to the body doesn't matter
[1:40:50] what happens to the spirit you are
[1:40:53] secure eternally Hallelujah I'm so glad
[1:40:56] that God watches over his word amen he
[1:40:59] watches over his people amen hallelujah
[1:41:02] he is now the high priest of his own
[1:41:05] word amen hallelujah he says now he came
[1:41:08] down let's just start with this I just
[1:41:10] love this amen where he says but there
[1:41:11] was no man on Earth could do the job
[1:41:13] speaking of the state that Adam's Fallen
[1:41:15] race was in we're all as worldly
[1:41:17] speaking in the same boat we're all born
[1:41:19] in sin shaped in iniquity come to world
[1:41:21] speaking lies and none of us could help
[1:41:23] each other we stood helpless defeated
[1:41:25] Chaos on every hand all ununited we can
[1:41:28] not keep the laws and ceremonies finding
[1:41:30] their weaknesses and so forth we could
[1:41:31] not do it and it seemed like the whole
[1:41:33] human race was laid waste sometimes we
[1:41:36] can look at it now we're on chaos is on
[1:41:38] every hand you know trouble in the world
[1:41:40] but no there's a Difference Maker comes
[1:41:43] on the scene then he came he came down
[1:41:45] amen because he was in the beginning the
[1:41:47] Bible said he was the word he was the
[1:41:49] logos that went out of God and the logos
[1:41:51] in the beginning was the word and he
[1:41:53] became the word then when he ascended on
[1:41:56] high on that glorious day of Easter he
[1:41:58] became not only the word but he became
[1:42:00] the high priest of his own word am me oh
[1:42:02] what a glorious thing brother nil just
[1:42:04] think he's not only the word but he is
[1:42:06] the high priest of his own word how
[1:42:08] could we doubt it how could we walk to
[1:42:10] him and not believe that we receive what
[1:42:12] we ask for for he is the word and the
[1:42:14] intercessor of the word the logos became
[1:42:17] word and the word became flesh and the
[1:42:18] same flesh that was the word received up
[1:42:20] into Glory now is the high priest making
[1:42:22] intercession by himself to his word now
[1:42:26] you think about in the Old Testament
[1:42:27] where Solomon do you think of the power
[1:42:29] of you know God God um undertaking to
[1:42:34] fulfill a Word of Promise now here is
[1:42:36] Solomon I know it's just a drawing of
[1:42:38] but but this is just a you know when
[1:42:40] Solomon dedicated the temple he said
[1:42:42] Lord if anyone look towards this Temple
[1:42:44] and pray may you hear from heaven then
[1:42:47] God came down filled the place with his
[1:42:49] glory and basically basically he's
[1:42:52] saying Amen to the temple he came and
[1:42:55] dwelt in it and he's saying Amen to
[1:42:56] Solomon's Prayer now here was a he was a
[1:42:59] natural King praying that God would God
[1:43:02] would
[1:43:04] Undertake and we know that Jonah now now
[1:43:07] there's many more than just Jonah but
[1:43:08] you know Jonah Jonah was in the belly of
[1:43:10] a
[1:43:11] whale and he remembered Solomon's Prayer
[1:43:15] amen that's right and so here he is he
[1:43:17] says but he says yet I'm cast out of the
[1:43:19] sight yet I'll look again to toward thy
[1:43:21] Holy Temple now we know he physically
[1:43:23] didn't know where he was but by faith he
[1:43:25] could look amen so so God now heard
[1:43:28] heard his prayer because he had
[1:43:30] confidence in the prayer of a natural
[1:43:32] King that God would answer that prayer
[1:43:35] amen he says here now I went down to the
[1:43:37] bottoms of the of the mountains the
[1:43:39] Earth where their bars was about me
[1:43:40] forever yet thou Hast brought up my life
[1:43:42] from corruption oh Lord my God when my
[1:43:45] soul fainted within me I remembered the
[1:43:46] Lord and my prayer came in unto thee
[1:43:48] into thine Holy Temple they that observe
[1:43:51] lying vanities forsake their own Mercy
[1:43:53] but I'll sacrifice unto thee with the
[1:43:55] voice of Thanksgiving I'll pay it that I
[1:43:57] have vowed salvation as of the Lord and
[1:43:59] the Lord spake unto the fish and vomited
[1:44:01] out Jonah upon the dry land Hallelujah
[1:44:05] so Jonah was in whales belly and he
[1:44:08] praised God but he had confidence that
[1:44:10] God would hear his prayer because God
[1:44:13] heard the prayer of Solomon
[1:44:17] amen now
[1:44:19] amen you know our lord Jesus has prayed
[1:44:21] for
[1:44:23] us now now Jonah had confidence in
[1:44:25] Solomon's Prayer now how much now you
[1:44:27] just read all of John 17 I've just taken
[1:44:29] out a few scriptures just to put on a
[1:44:31] slide okay but now this whole chapter is
[1:44:35] a prayer he says I've given given them
[1:44:38] Thy word and the world hath hated them
[1:44:40] because they are not of the world even
[1:44:42] as I'm not of the world I pray that thou
[1:44:44] should not should us not keep them um
[1:44:47] sorry I pray that thou should us take
[1:44:50] wow I pray not that thou should us take
[1:44:53] them out of the world but thou should us
[1:44:55] keep them from the evil I hope I got
[1:44:56] that the fifth time okay they are not of
[1:44:59] the world even as I am not of the world
[1:45:01] neither do I pray these for these alone
[1:45:03] so I've just dropped down a few verses
[1:45:04] neither do I pray these for the neither
[1:45:06] pray I for these alone but for them also
[1:45:09] which Shall Believe on me through their
[1:45:11] word amen that they all may be one as
[1:45:15] thou father art in me and I in thee that
[1:45:18] they also may be one in us that the
[1:45:20] world May believe that thou Hast sent me
[1:45:22] and the glory which thou Gest me I have
[1:45:25] given them that they may be one even as
[1:45:27] we are one so he's not just praying for
[1:45:31] the disciples my Lord that they would be
[1:45:33] kept from the evil that'd be in the but
[1:45:34] he's praying for you and I why because
[1:45:37] we have believed on the Lord through
[1:45:38] their word amen amen so you go read that
[1:45:42] John 17 you realize actually this is not
[1:45:44] the prayers of Solomon now this is not a
[1:45:47] king who would be sure the wisest man
[1:45:48] but would backslide and fall and all
[1:45:50] these things but this was a greater than
[1:45:52] Solomon is here right this was the king
[1:45:54] of glory made flesh interceded for us
[1:45:57] upon the Earth and prayed for us that
[1:46:00] we'd be kept from the evil what is that
[1:46:02] evil that is unbelief is the greatest
[1:46:03] evil there is sin is just an attribute
[1:46:06] you know I mean all the things you see
[1:46:08] is just attributes of unbelief you see
[1:46:09] around you in the world so the Lord
[1:46:11] actually prayed for us that we'd be kept
[1:46:13] from these things amen don't you think
[1:46:15] God can don't you think that he can be
[1:46:17] the high priest of his own prayer am
[1:46:19] mean to keep you in this
[1:46:21] world I may be condensing it down very
[1:46:24] Elementary but you know do we have
[1:46:26] confidence no no I'm talking about
[1:46:28] myself now cuz you see you know things
[1:46:30] in life and yourself and Lord how can
[1:46:31] this ever be and how's it ever how we
[1:46:33] ever going to get through this but when
[1:46:34] you sit back and you realize he found me
[1:46:38] he made a way before the enemy was ever
[1:46:40] here nothing can stop him nothing could
[1:46:43] stop him redeeming us on Calvary hell
[1:46:46] couldn't stop him ascending amen right
[1:46:48] sin couldn't stop him nothing could stop
[1:46:50] stop him he rose triumphant forever more
[1:46:52] he's now the high priest of our
[1:46:54] profession he's been working down
[1:46:55] through seven Church ages and he's still
[1:46:57] alive today nothing can stop him now
[1:47:00] amen hallelujah so many things we say
[1:47:02] Lord how's this ever going to happen but
[1:47:04] we just got to Lord maybe we just have
[1:47:05] greater confidence in you Lord that's my
[1:47:07] prayer this morning amen that that
[1:47:09] because this prayer that is that we
[1:47:11] would be one as as as here saying that
[1:47:14] him and his father were one remember and
[1:47:16] the father that he said it's not me that
[1:47:18] doeth the works but the father that
[1:47:20] dwelleth me doth the works right so that
[1:47:22] Oneness that he had was with the Holy
[1:47:24] Ghost was within him in the fullness
[1:47:25] right and God was manifesting himself
[1:47:27] through Jesus Christ is that okay if I
[1:47:29] put it that way amen so now that was the
[1:47:31] prayer that that would happen and so now
[1:47:33] if you've received the Holy Ghost you
[1:47:34] you can actually say I am the answer to
[1:47:37] Jesus
[1:47:39] prayer praise the Lord hallelujah is
[1:47:42] that all right amen so now so we can
[1:47:44] have such confidence I believe this
[1:47:46] morning now Jonah wasn't the only one
[1:47:49] I'm just going to use another for
[1:47:50] example Jehoshaphat in 2 Chronicles was
[1:47:53] in a big trouble the enemies came
[1:47:55] against them he couldn't win he
[1:47:57] assembled um it was it was Jerusalem and
[1:48:00] and and Judah and they went into the new
[1:48:02] court there by the temple and they
[1:48:04] called unto God because they believed
[1:48:07] that God would answer Solomon's Prayer
[1:48:10] that's why they went to the temple to
[1:48:11] call upon God when they're calling upon
[1:48:13] God God came down and prophesied through
[1:48:16] a man and said what to do now there's
[1:48:19] more
[1:48:20] inst there's more things than just that
[1:48:23] but I'm saying if God can answer
[1:48:25] Solomon's Prayer can he answer his own
[1:48:27] prayer for your life you know some
[1:48:30] people think well no one's ever prayed
[1:48:31] for me Jesus already has and now he is
[1:48:34] the high priest of his own word amen and
[1:48:37] what that means is is is he is here now
[1:48:40] to cause his word to come to pass
[1:48:43] Hallelujah so I'm just going to wrap up
[1:48:44] with this because I've gone over time
[1:48:46] I'm just going to leave you with this
[1:48:47] thought now in Hebrews Hebrews 13 we
[1:48:50] find this it's called here the
[1:48:52] Everlasting Covenant God had a covenant
[1:48:54] with them but the blood now is an
[1:48:56] Everlasting Covenant the blood of Jesus
[1:48:57] Christ God's bloodbound promises make
[1:49:00] makes us free from sin and self makes us
[1:49:03] free from anything of the world no
[1:49:04] matter how much we try to Fashion it the
[1:49:06] world it's all dead for in God's
[1:49:09] bloodbound promises we see nothing but
[1:49:11] the blood how could you look out that
[1:49:13] door without seeing the blood now this
[1:49:15] is talking about in the Old Testament
[1:49:16] with the first Exodus they put the blood
[1:49:18] on the door and L right so how could you
[1:49:20] look out the door then without seeing
[1:49:21] the blood now how can you look out at
[1:49:23] anything without first seeing the blood
[1:49:24] of Jesus Christ amen so I trust when we
[1:49:27] look at everything in life we see the
[1:49:29] blood first amen so when we look at our
[1:49:32] family we see the blood we don't see
[1:49:34] what they're doing we we see the blood
[1:49:37] amen we see the blood atoning for them
[1:49:39] we see the blood interceding for them we
[1:49:41] see the blood bringing them home all the
[1:49:43] blood amen when you look at sickness I
[1:49:45] trust you don't see the sickness you see
[1:49:47] the blood before the sickness I mean
[1:49:48] that God is already by his Stripes
[1:49:50] They're healed amen I trust that's how
[1:49:52] you look amen when you see people on the
[1:49:54] street you never look down your nose at
[1:49:57] anyone you know but you see them through
[1:49:59] the blood amen well then well what does
[1:50:02] that mean you say well the blood that
[1:50:04] atone for you Lord you save me you can
[1:50:07] save anyone Lord doesn't matter where
[1:50:09] they're coming out of how deep they are
[1:50:10] in sin whatever they're trying to do
[1:50:12] what the devil's doing to them Legion
[1:50:14] had a legion of demons in him but Jesus
[1:50:17] looked through at him through you could
[1:50:18] say his own blood and S A Son of God
[1:50:21] that needed to be redeemed amen so I
[1:50:23] pray we can look at everything that way
[1:50:25] amen that we and then and then when we
[1:50:27] look at the promises of God and his word
[1:50:29] we're looking through the blood of the
[1:50:31] promise amen amen so so to me that means
[1:50:34] that now God purchased that promise
[1:50:37] that'll be manifested in our lives
[1:50:40] hallelujah amen thank Hallelujah I trust
[1:50:43] I trust that's how we see things this
[1:50:45] morning amen that we we look at every
[1:50:47] situation through the blood God is per
[1:50:50] purposed it there's a reason for it Lord
[1:50:53] show yourself to me in it Lord even if
[1:50:55] you may be silent Lord I know you're
[1:50:56] working in my life because you're
[1:50:58] actively
[1:51:00] interceding leading me protecting me
[1:51:03] guiding me through life's journey I
[1:51:06] think really when we get to the other
[1:51:07] side and we see our lives replayed we'll
[1:51:09] be shocked at how much God was in our
[1:51:12] lives sometimes I think we just see him
[1:51:14] this much like he answered my prayer
[1:51:16] here and he did this here but we don't
[1:51:18] realize he's there the whole time I know
[1:51:20] what's going on with this can we just
[1:51:21] I'm getting fizzed at you know but if we
[1:51:24] could just really realize God is in
[1:51:26] every situation doesn't matter if you
[1:51:28] feel it you don't feel it if you feel
[1:51:30] happy sad mad or glad whatever it is
[1:51:32] frustrated God's right there but if we
[1:51:34] can look at it just realize Lord you've
[1:51:36] never I've never been alone amen you've
[1:51:38] always been my helper and my guide and
[1:51:40] Lord may we just trust you more Lord
[1:51:42] that's just my prayer this morning amen
[1:51:43] let's have the musicians please am mean
[1:51:45] but he is a faithful and merciful high
[1:51:48] priest and because he was a man he
[1:51:51] understands the Frailty of humanity he
[1:51:53] understands what we go through maybe
[1:51:54] that's a whole another subject maybe
[1:51:56] next Sunday I think I've been saying
[1:51:57] that a bit too much but you know let's
[1:52:00] stand shall we amen and let's um let's
