Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] Hey, heat. Hey, heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Good morning. God bless you all. Welcome to the house of God. How you all feeling? Nice. Excited about the new what? Are you excited about what the new day is about to bring? I'm sure there's a verse that says the about the steadfast love of the Lord never ceases. That his mercies his love and his mercy is new every morning. So every morning you wake up, you get a you get a new opportunity to experience the love and the mercy of God. Amen. It's good to [music] be a Christian. It's good to be alive. I was just thinking before like humans I've always had this a high belief in mankind that humans have uh God made humans very intelligent very smart and we we can adapt you know we [music] can get thrown into a situation and then we get startled for a bit then we adapt and we can make we we just make stuff work usually that's why we that's why we're all still alive in this world cuz we just make things work somehow you know and humans survive in the most remote places where they shouldn't survive They just make it work and they live there. Guys live on ice or they live on sand, you know, and they they're still alive. But, you know, I'm thinking about this. I'm I'm sort of getting the hang of I'm getting like my little spaces to live sort of like [music] uh a bit impaired. Like I'm like I put my crutches up there. I'm like, "Oh, there's my new crutches spot." You know, and then here's all these little spots. Here's my little thing. you know, we we adapt and we we just get used to living like that, which is a good strength of humans, but it does have its downside if you think about certain things like a brother preached a sermon once it was called learning to live in the dark, you know, cuz when the darkness comes, you're at first you think, "Wow, I can't see anything. This is not good or whatever it might be." But then your eyes adjust and then you can start to function living in the dark. And you know, it's the same in our Christian walk. We we got to watch that Satan doesn't lump something on us and then we just start to accept it and we start to accept that something negative or some complex or something is well I'll just live with this because we can just adapt and live with it like you know I don't want to live with this you know I don't want the I'm not going to adapt to this new normal it's not going to be the new normal and in our Christian walk we don't want to we got to I think we got to check our lives every now and then and just check that we're not adapting to some complex and thinking oh well this is just the way it's going to be and I'll just adjust and I'll adapt my life and I'll just live with this thing even though it hinders me. I'll just figure out a way to make it work and we'll [music] go with that. We We don't want to learn how to live in the dark. We want to live in the light. Amen. Let's stand this morning. But we I thank the Lord that we serve a God that can remind us and show us and he if we're stuck in something, he can show us the way out. He always gives us the way out. So, let's just pray this morning. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful that we can come to the God, Lord, that cares, that understands, Lord, that knows us intricately. And often there's many times that we might even forget. yet we might start to be living under certain things and not even realize that we are, Lord. But I thank you, Lord, that that you're the great builder, Lord, that you're the you're the you're the master builder, that you you know what's going on in our life, Lord. And and the more we surrender it to you, the more you just work on us and you you work on these different areas of our life, Lord. And may may we not adapt and live under anything that Satan's put on us, Lord. May you show us what those things are and we want to break free of anything Lord that's hindering us that's from [music] fulfilling our our purpose or being 100% of who who you've made us Lord Jesus. So I just want to pray you bless the service this morning where you may you minister in a powerful way. Bless the word bless the songs Lord as [music] we enter into your courts with praise Lord and thanksgiving Lord and we want to go to the battle with praise and with worship Lord and may may you um [music] accept the worship of our heart this morning. Not not our lips, Lord, but it comes from a I believe each one here a pure heart that loves you, Lord. And just bless the word. May there be a powerful anointing, Lord. And we receive it as from you this morning. May you just um minister in a powerful way. We just pray and commit the service to your hands in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's going to be a good service this morning. You excited? &gt;&gt; Let's just greet each other. Say hello to your Say hello to your fellow soldiers this morning.

The saint [singing] song. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we're here. Praise the Lord. If you ever feel grumpy, frustrated, angry, bitter, you need more the love of God. It cures everything. Amen. Amen. Let's um let's uh read from Joel chapter 1. Sorry about that technical glitch. Uh so Joel 1, I'm going to read verses 12-13. Then we're going to go to 2 Samuel 23. So Joel 1. And if you're there, if you say amen. Amen. So it says here, "Now the vine is dried up and the fig tree languisheth. The pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree. Even all the trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men. Gird yourselves and lament ye priests. Howl, ye ministers of the altar. Come lie all night on uh in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God. For the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. Amen. And then we're going to go to 2 Samuel uh chapter 23 14-17 which which is David's mighty men here. And so verse I'm just make sure I'm in the right place. So so 2 Samuel there 23 and4 it says and David was then in an hold and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. And David longed and said oh that one would give me a drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate. And the three mighty men break through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David. Nevertheless, he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the Lord. And he said, "Be it far from me, oh Lord, that I should do this. Is not this the blood of the men uh that went in jeopardy of their lives? Therefore, he would not drink it. These things did these uh these things did these three mighty men. Amen. Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. If you want to be it's me, oh Lord, standing in need of prayer. You want to slip your hand up, say, "Lord, truly I need you to pass my way this morning." Amen. Gracious heavenly father, we thank you, dear God. We can gather in this way. Lord, as a people, Lord, under your blood, Lord, we can praise you, give you glory. And Father, as we stand here, Lord, take control of every life, Lord. We surrender all that we are, body, soul, and spirit, dear God, into your divine hands. That you would speak, Lord. You could you would hear through us, Lord. That you give us hearts to receive, dear God. That Father, your your word would come forth, Lord God, and speak to every life. Cast out every enemy. Defeat the evil one in our midst. Oh God. May you change our lives, change our thinking, change our attitudes, dear God. Heal the sick among us, dear God. Those not not just here, but those who are streaming. Lord, be everyone's abundant portion. We commit our lives into your hands. We thank you for this opportunity once more in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you friends. You can uh have your seats this morning. So I want to speak about see um I want to speak about the meal and the drink offering. Now uh this this scripture here um we can look at it as a uh I want to take the opposite of this scripture. Okay. So because Joel here um Joel was speaking before this of a promised restoration, a restoration of all things, a restoration of the gospel, a restoration of the bride tree. I mean this is before now. Now now he was looking at prophecy that these things were missing out of the church. But but then in Joel chapter 2, he says, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord." And I want to declare to you this morning, God has restored. Amen. Through the message of the hour. So we're not so we're on the other side of the scripture. Now, if you don't have these things in your life, you need to say, "God, fill me with the Holy Ghost." I mean, because these offerings that were withholden, you know, you know, I read the scripture, you know, you know, I see these things and and I think, I wonder why God mentions these two offerings, right? Then, you know, because God is deliberate. God is intentional with his words. He doesn't just say things without meaning or significance. Because we understand there's more than just two offerings that the priest would give. There's the there's a sin offering. There's an offering for ignorance. There's the, you know, there's the atonement, there's the peace offering. There's all these different offerings that would happen in the Old Testament. But here in Joel, he just, you know, he just he just points out two that are not in the house of the Lord, which is the which is the meat offering or the meal offering um and the drink offering. So, we want to we want to look into these things this morning. But, you know, I want to announce to you that through the message of the hour, these things are in the church. Amen. These are in the bride. Now when he talks about the house of your God, I want to say well the true house of your God is you. Amen. So these things are not just on a church level though we could go that way or age level but I want to talk about personally to you. I mean I want to have a conversation with you and see how are you doing this morning? How's things you know how's your walk and how's your victory and you know in spite of what you're going through that's actually a relevant. How are you doing in the trial? How are you doing? It's a it's a victorious walk remember there's batters and battered you know you get battered and bruised and whatever more but it is victorious now I I find it you know so so we have been restored so the message of the hour restores us back to the full power of Pentecost and it restores us back to Paul's gospel right so everything that was had the church the church had in in the original we have been restored to so we're not just restored to the spirit but we're restored to the word now brother said that there's the fundamentalist that know who they are in the scripture, but they have no power. It's like they got no money in the bank. Amen. And there's those who have the spirit. They've got all the money in the bank, but they have no way to actually put it into being. Right? He says, if we could just get those two together, then I'll show you a church that's really on fire for God. I just want to tell you, we have been restored to that. Amen. We have all the money in the bank. We know who we are, right? And we have the faith to draw it out and put it into being. Amen. So, we have both the mechanics and the dynamics. We have been restored back to Paul's gospel with the power. Now remember Paul said, "I didn't come to you in word only, but in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost." So it's not just vain empty words of a dead letter, a dead sermon. No, this is a living word. Amen. There's a living gospel. Amen. That comes with power. Power to overcome, power to cast out the enemy, power to bring joy, power to bring peace, power to bring healing, amen, power to bring deliverance. It's all in the word. And we have been restored back. Amen. To that word. Praise the Lord. So I want to take the opposite of the scripture. Amen. But you see now there's a big, you see, see joy joy is very important. It's more than just being happy. Let's just break this down a little bit. Let's just let's just wait. Well, it should be on here somewhere. See, he says he says the all the all the fruit has is is withered. The fig tree languageth all these things because the joy because joy is withered away from the sons of men. If there ever was a people that should be full of joy to overflowing, it should be you and I. Amen. Because we know where we're going. We know in whom we have believed. Amen. We know what he's done in our lives. Amen. We know he saved us from hell. We know he saved us from sin. We know he's delivered us from all things of the enemy. Amen. I think if there's a people that should be happy, it should be you and I. Oh, you don't know what I'm going through. But you should look at what Jesus has gone through for you already. What he's already done to your life. Amen. Done to your soul. I think that should put a joy, a joy in our step. Amen. Amen. Because we to realize the joy of the Lord is our strength. Amen. And we should, you know, we come to church to worship God. &gt;&gt; Right. Every day of our life should be a worship. We don't And what you put the the main thing that influences you in your life is what you're worshiping. &gt;&gt; That's right. So if you got a complex and it and that directs your life, that's your God. If you've got unforgiveness and that directs your life, well, I can't speak to that person, this person, and this and all these things, that's actually your God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you if you are offended by someone, you hold that offense and you put that more important than the word of God, that's your God. But I believe I'm looking at a people that will not let anything take God's place in their life. I mean, they want the word of God to have preeminence. Amen. in spite of all things. Amen. They will worship and love the Lord. So, you may have had the worst morning this morning. Put that to one side. We're here to worship God. We're here to express back to God what he's done for us with thanksgiving. Amen. And this joy that's come into our hearts is because of revelation. It's not because of it's it's more than an emotion. It's more than a nice idea. It's revelation. That's why I have the joy of the Lord because he's revealed to me that Calvary was for me. He's revealed to me the rapture is for me. He's revealed to me every divine promise in his word is mine. Amen. So I've got the joy cuz he said it's yours. Amen. Hallelujah. And if he's given it to me, I say, "Praise you. Thank you, Lord. I'm your child and I can just walk on and be happy." &gt;&gt; Oh, but but but I'm going through bad things. Just put everything in perspective. You have eternal life. &gt;&gt; You You got a good deal. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's traded be Yeah. beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning. Amen. you once morning, but I trust you got the your oil of joy this morning. Amen. You can rejoice and shout and praise God and have liberty. Amen. Who cares about the critics? They're called to do what they'll do. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to be a critic. My position in the word is not to be a critic. My position in the word is to be a worshshiper. Amen. To praise God, to give him glory. That's my position in the scripture. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, joy is more than just being happy. as I said is David would say in Psalms wait um here we'll we'll come back to that Psalms 51 this is after he has taken Bashibba and and we know it was about 2 years after he did that had Uriah killed all those things committed adultery with Bashibba that that Nathan the prophet came and exposed David's life and so he would write this psalm after that had taken place and he said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit You see, he hadn't lost his salvation. The prophet teaches he lost the joy of it. Amen. And remember, this is the joy of God's salvation. God's salvation is permanent. It's eternal. If you're really saved, you're really saved. If you're sealed to the day of your redemption, you're sealed to the day of your redemption. And no devil in hell can break that seal. Amen. Cuz God put it on there. What God puts on, he nothing can take it off. Amen. Cuz he's the strongest one. Amen. So his seal stands. It holds like Kyra digs you would do at a camp. do this. It's sealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. You could be a vessel that's been kicked around. Oh, there you go. Hey, sometimes. Yeah. Thank you so much for that. But you know, but you see the seal holds, right? I could No, we won't do that. [laughter] We're not playing catch. But just to illustrate, right, that this was dropped. It was thrown around. It was pushed down. Pushed, you know, all that kind of stuff. Put it into different hands. thrown around, but the seal held. And you may go from depression to hardship to heartache to problems being thrown around, maybe in your mind to whole different things. But if you got a seal of God in your soul, I mean, the seal holds in spite of what's going on in your spirit realm. Hallelujah. You're going to realize, I'm going through a bad thing, but I'm sealed in my soul. I mean, I'm safe and secure because I'm part of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, so David's joy had to be restored. And you know what happened is he got into this spot because instead of him fulfilling God's purpose for his life, he decided, I'm just going to sit home and be a selfish believer. &gt;&gt; And if you sit home, you can be, we say, "I'm at church now." You can be sitting at home in church. &gt;&gt; Bless me, preacher. Bless me, singer. I'm not going to be part of the service. I'm just going to be watching. We're not here to sit here and eat some popcorn and watch what's going on. We're here to be part of the service. You're you're as important in this service as I am. Or the musicians or the deacons or the Sunday school teachers, you're just as important in this service that I am. Amen. Cuz we're here to create an atmosphere. Amen. Where where God would inspire me and he would inspire you. Amen. Where worship, See, do you know why I preach? It's a worship to God. &gt;&gt; This is why I preach it. So, sure, it feeds you, but it's really a worship that I get a chance to stand here for about an hour and express back to God what he means to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and what you mean to me and what you mean to God. So, I'm here actually I'm just going to worship for an hour. You can join in if you want. Amen. We can all be part of it together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you see, you see, you know, David, he would sit home when his men were fighting and and and he he he stopped fulfilling what God would have him to do because he was anointed. He was called. He was he was he was put forth that God would through David would they would possess the entire promised land. But he got to a spot and said, "I'm just going to stay home." What did he do? He became selfish. He looked out his window and he saw some something someone Bashibba that wasn't his, but he was selfish. I want her. And this is what happens when people they lose their purpose. They lose their focus of life. They just become to be selfish. Well, that's not right. And this is wrong and I want this and what can I get out of it? We don't want to get in that position. &gt;&gt; Right? But you see, this is what happened. his joy, the joy of his salvation withered away. But then God restored that joy. And you say, "Well, I don't have that joy I once had." You can get it back. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm older now. My kids are older, or now I'm a gr, you know, every station of life. Doesn't matter if you're a kid that's carefree, a teenager trying to find your way in the world. adult, single, married, you know, married couple, married with kids, married with babies, married with toddlers, married with teenagers, married with adult kids. You're a grandparent. Doesn't matter what stage of life you are. Amen. The joy of the Lord transcends every circumstance you find yourself in. Amen. Our joy is not based on what we're going through. It's not based on our bank account. It's not based on our health. It's not based on our whatever you think that it should be based on. This is upon revelation. Amen. God has saved me. He sealed me. He sent me his word. Amen. His covenant angel. He He himself has come and confirmed his covenant with me. Amen. That should make me happy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You say, "Well, I just don't feel I'm just in a different stage." No, we should actually be more more joyful &gt;&gt; as we go along because as we go along, God unveils more of himself personally to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see, it's important that we have the joy of the Lord's salvation because he says, "Then will I teach transgressors thy way, and sinners shall be converted unto thee." &gt;&gt; So if you want to see people converted, have the joy of the Lord's salvation in you. It's more than doctrine, more than just an argument, more than a nice, you know, kind of, well, this is just how it is. You got to have something that's real. People aren't looking for an argument. The world's full of it. Amen. They're looking for real life. They're looking for the love of God. How rich and pure. Amen. And where's where are they going to see it? In you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you want to see people saved, be happy about what you got. I've never seen someone try and sell a product and they're successful and they're really unhappy. I remember going to the donut there was a doughut king in Wellington airport all these donuts and I I asked the lady behind the counter, well- which is your favorite donut? And she said, I don't like donuts. That's what she said straight. I'm like I just thinking, why are you working here then? If you don't like what you're selling, go find something you like selling. You'll enjoy You'll enjoy your job a lot more. Imagine going to a place. I hate this place. I hate the donut. I don't like donuts. You know, [laughter] I'm just trapped. Get [snorts] happy about life, man. We God wants us to be happy. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want us to be sad and frowny and I'm I'm just being pious. No, I think you gone a bit moldy and a bit off. You know, you do get a bit of life about you. Get a bit happy. Amen. So anyway, I bought a donut, but I thought I'm not going to ask you again. [snorts] It can be like someone who's not free to talk about the Lord. You know, someone asks you about God and you can't really answer. It's like, oh wow, that person's not happy with what you know what's wrong with them. &gt;&gt; You know, it should be actually, man, what have they got? &gt;&gt; Man, if they're happy about it, they just light up and praise the Lord and they begin to share things and you think, man, that at least that person's got something that's heartfelt religion. Don't you want that? We're not meant to have headfilled religion, it's heartfelt religion. Amen. That's what brother Bram said it was. Right. So, Amen. So, if you want if you want people to be if you want people to be uh have saved, Amen. be happy with what you got. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you see now when when he says about there's fruit that's withered and so on, a main a main problem with a you know in a natural tree is that is that uh that tree has a lack of moisture. It's a dry spell. It's not getting it's not getting the water it needs. The fruit withers. I want to say this that we are we are not we are not planted in a dry place. I'm talking about being you being planted in Christ. That is not a dry place. That is not a desert place. That's not some blasting wilderness where nothing can grow. No, it is it is a place of bountiful water. Amen. And we don't need to be careful that the aquafare aquifer is going to run dry. This can never run dry. Amen. being planted by rivers of living water. Amen. This is where you're planted. So, I tell you what, friends, there's something within us that we cannot wither. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something within the believer now. You got this inexhaustible fountain. Now, it's more than how you feel, right? The fruits of the spirit are more than how you feel. It's the life of God being produced. But I tell you what, we're not This message is not a dry message. It's not a dead message. It's not an intellectual message. It's a living message. He's a living word. because this message is Jesus Christ revealed. Amen. So we we we are not planted by a dry place. He says, "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the scornful." So you're blessed if you're not in any of those places. But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law does he meditate day and night. Amen. So if you've got a delight, you ought to have a delight for the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very important. You should be enjoying what you're experiencing. You should be enjoying the word of the Lord. Doesn't matter what you're going through. Your source of comfort should not be doom scrolling. Your source of comfort should be the word of God. Amen. I tell you what, you know, we all have a spiritual appetite. The world has a spiritual appetite. Right? They they fill their spirit up on all kinds of things. I tell you what, if you're feeling withered and dry and, you know, cold and different, I say change your appetite. &gt;&gt; Amen. Change it to the right kind of music. change it to the, you know, there's multitudes of sermons online that you can be very blessed by. You say, you know, even if you think, well, I don't know what to listen to, I can send you a whole bunch. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to send them out. I'm really happy about it. Right. So, if you're wondering, man, where should I start eating? I'll say, well, start here. This is a real good entree. Now, here's some mans. And actually, I believe in we should have dessert first cuz that's I'm a sweet, too. So, you can have this. It's real sweet. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think we should do that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Check what your spiritual diet is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we have been planted as as as brother Brown would preach from this message, the restoration of the bride tree. Tell we have been restored. &gt;&gt; We are placed in a good place. Amen. Where the fruit of the spirit is living. Amen. We have we have living water. Amen. So, we're not living in a place, a believer is not living in a place where they where they are dried up. I'm just trying to find where I should be now. You [snorts] say, you know, speaking go, you know, you know, just going back to David, I just want to put this point in here because many people they they think once I find my position in the body, then I can really worship. Then I can really have my purpose. You know what we're called to do first and foremost? We're called to be a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, I'm not a I don't know if I'm a preacher or a deacon, a song leader, a musician, or what what." No, you don't need to worry about that. You're a worshshiper first and foremost. That's why I said a while ago, I this is actually me worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Right? But before I did it here, I did it there. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it doesn't really matter. You say, I don't know what my purpose is in the body. You're here to worship God. You're here to be a worshiper. How you treat one another should be a worship. How you treat those lost on the street should be a worship. How you treat your family should be a worship. That you should give them honor and respect and love and care, that's actually a worship because you're doing it as unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what we should do. So David, David lost his purpose. But I tell you what, friends, we're being restored back to what our purpose should be. &gt;&gt; Remember, God inhabits the praises of his people. &gt;&gt; So if you want God to come down in a service, praise him. &gt;&gt; Give him glory. You say, "Well, I'm not that exuberant." You don't need to be. You can be sitting there just with such a love bubbling forth. You whisper, "Lord, you're so great." It creates an atmosphere in the unseen realm. God begins to inhabit that praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God comes down and changes people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, what's the opposite of withered? I'm going to get to those two offerings, but I just want to just go through this real quick. The opposite of withered. So, I was wondering what is the opposite? This is what Webster told me. It means revived, &gt;&gt; flourished, bloomed, it grew. Amen. So, the fruits are what? The fruits have revived because of the word. Amen. They've flourished. That you are a fruitful vine. Amen. You're a fruitful people. Amen. You've bloomed. Amen. You're not withered in some dead kind of tree. Amen. No, you bloomed. You've grew. Amen. God's matured you. Amen. You've prospered spiritually. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've increased. You've thrived. Amen. You're actually a thriving people. Do you know that the believer is a thriving person? Amen. You've developed. You've become uh freshened. You've waxed. You've peaked. You've surged. You've crested. I like that. &gt;&gt; This is this is what you are doing. You say, "Well, I'm just I'm just scraping through life." But spiritually, You've bloomed. I mean, there's fruit. There's life that wasn't there maybe a year ago, two years ago. Why? Because now what? The joy of the Lord has been restored. And the fruit of the bride tree is coming forth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, God hasn't done anything for me. I got nothing to worship him for. You've been kept by the power of God. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm I'm just going through life." You're still a believer. &gt;&gt; You're still here. &gt;&gt; You've been kept by the power of God. Every day you wake up, you say, "Thank you, Lord, for another day. Thank you, Lord. You give me one uh one more day to say I love you. Hallelujah. Still walking in faith in spite of all opposition. That's God's keeping power. That's God's enablement, God's strength, God's virtue poured into your life by the power of God through faith. Praise the Lord. Now, let's just go down to this uh the next verse. Now, he says, "Gird yourselves and lament ye priests. How ye ministers the altar come lie all night and sackcloth ye ministers of my God. For the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God. Now this word withholden it means to actually to keep in custody to hold back from action. It means to refrain from granting, giving or allowing or to withhold permission. So so the complaint that God would give to them in that day was these offerings weren't even in the house of God. And this is sadly what will what can happen when when when when the life of God, the word of God is not allowed to have preeminence. Now all of both of these offerings we understand they are pointing to Jesus Christ. Every offering in the Old Testament was pointing to him. He is our Passover lamb. &gt;&gt; He's our blood of the atonement. &gt;&gt; Amen. He He is He's our peace offering. He's even the scapegoat. Amen. He is the He is the um turtle dove that was killed. The blood was put on the living mate. Amen. We are the living mate bathing the earth with the blood. Right? But all those sacrifices point to Christ. So they're a shadow of things to come. So they have a purpose in being. Now this meal or meat offering that we read about it's it's it's mixed with a few things. Now I enjoyed this. So if you don't well I'll just enjoy it again. Okay. Now in in Leviticus here it says, "And when uh any will offer a meat uh a meat offering unto the Lord, his offering shall be a fine flour. He shall uh pour oil upon it and put frankincense thereon. And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priest, and he shall take uh there his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof. And the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar. And it shall be an offering made by a fire of a sweet savior unto the Lord. And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons. It is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire. And if thou will bring an oblation of um of a meat offering bacon in the oven, it shall be of shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. Now the meal and the meat offering are really the same thing in the scripture. Okay? See? So so notice here. It shall be fine flour. It's unleavened. There's no sin in this offering at all. Okay? And you got to and and he was instructed, you got to pour oil upon this. Amen. So, this offering's got to be anointed. Amen. It's not some dry intellectual understanding, but the anointing of the Holy Ghost is upon this offering. Amen. And you shall put frankincense within it. Amen. Now, frankincense speaks of the service of God. Now I'm kind of um he says here he says now now frankincense I want to get these quickly. Frankincense is the offering of the service to Jehovah. Now if you want to put these scriptures down Leviticus 2 and 2 Leviticus 16-15 we find out that's the order of the priesthood to make an offering to Jehovah. When he put the offering it should be made and mixed with frankincense for a sin offering and they took different things and mixed it for the meal offering for the wave offering. Frankincense was added because it was acceptable to Jehovah. It was anointed with frankincense which means service to Jehovah God. Now we find out he's deity and they brought him frankincense was a type. He was uh service to Jehovah. Jesus is Jehovah's servant. So I mean so so this frankincense in uh in the offering represents that you're going to be put into service. Now when you partake of Christ, it puts you into action. Amen. You can't help it. You're no longer just a a spectator, but you're an active part of the body of Christ. Amen. It's like exactly like when when Isaiah was in the temple and you know he saw that great vision of God and the seraraphims crying holy holy and there was a cry went out from the Lord who go for us and he said here I am Lord send me and just before that there was a seraphim took the coals from the altar and touched his lips saying thy sin is purged amen so what happens is when he parttook of that or when that happened it put him into service there's something within him said here I am Lord send me what can I do Lord to further the body of Christ What can I do to be a blessing? What can I do to be a help? Amen. You know, one of the greatest ministries that you could ever have is this. You ask each other, "How you doing?" Show care and concern behind the scenes. That's actually a great thing to do. You sit down at lunch, say, "How you doing today? How's things? How you been?" And you show genuine care for people. That will actually help the body even probably, you know, you know, far greater than you fathom. To be friendly, kind, thoughtful, considerate. Amen. That's you actually put into action, showing care for for one another. Are we all together this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see this frankincense means that now you are put into action. Praise the Lord. Let's just go back up here. Sorry. [clears throat] He says here now and then also there. So, so it's anointed. Frankincense is put upon it. Amen. This gospel that we have, Christ is not not anointed. He's anointed. Amen. This is the Holy Ghost you're partaking of. Okay? And it says, "This offering shall be made by fire." Amen. You got to have a fire in your soul when the word comes your way. It wasn't just put there uncooked. It had to be burnt. Amen. There had to be a fire in your life. Amen. And when the fire of God comes into your life, then this meal offering you partake of, Amen. It fulfills what it's meant to fulfill. Amen. And then also, see, notice this in verse three. and the remnant of the meat um meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons. So the same offering that was placed on the altar they became part of. That's why it put them into action. Amen. So Christ that was given on Calvary, you become one with your sacrifice. I trust I'm not losing anyone this morning. Amen. You become part of him because remember he is the bread of life. Amen. He is the bread of life. Amen. So So we become one with him when we when we receive the word of God by faith into our souls. Amen. So now everything that's in Christ comes into you. You see this is why there would be that cry in Joel 1, howl and lament. These things aren't in the church. These aren't in the body because they weren't because there was no manifestation of those offerings in their lives. And this is what God wants to have us that we are we're anointed. Amen. We're put into action. Hallelujah. And there's no leaven in our lives. All the unbelief has been has been has been purged out. And there's fire the fire of God. And then also he says, "And that uh that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron and his sons. It is the most holy thing. The offerings of the Lord uh made by fire. No meat offering uh which ye shall bring unto the Lord shall be made with leaven, for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, and any offering of the Lord made by fire. Uh as for the oblation of the first fruits, ye shall offer them unto the Lord, but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savior. And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt. Amen. Neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of the Lord, I mean I mean of thy God to be lacking from any from thy meat offering. With all thine offerings, thou shalt offer salt. Amen. Naturally, you want to be salty, you eat salt. &gt;&gt; You know the doctor says, look, your salt levels are too high. You got to eat less salt. This is naturally, right? But we want to be salty. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there's got to be salt in this offering. Now what I'm putting to you this morning is look at your life and say, "Are these offerings, is this part of Christ living out of me? Am I salty? Am I put into service? Is there something within me saying, "Lord, I want to be a blessing to the body. I want to be a witness. I just want to be bubbling. Lord, I want to I want to share the joy and the hope that's within my life." If there's something within me saying, "Lord, I want to tell somebody." &gt;&gt; That's what what what does that mean? That actually this meal offering has come into you, which is Christ, you've been put into action. &gt;&gt; Amen. You you see the anointing of God control your life. Amen. That means this this offering which you've partaken of has been anointed with oil. &gt;&gt; And are you salty? People like to be around you. They may never acknowledge God. They may never like, you know, or or receive what you have received, but there should be something in us, an atmosphere around us that people like to be around us. &gt;&gt; That's being salty, right? You're creating an you're creating a um an influence. Pardon me. God is now being able to influence those around you. Why? Because you're salty. Praise [snorts] the Lord. Amen. Jesus would say, he said, he said, "For the bread of God is he which come down from heaven even uh and giveth life unto the world." Then they said unto him,"Lord, evermore give us this bread." Jesus said unto them, "I am the bread of life." So he is the meal offering. He is all these offerings. Amen. And like the Apostle Paul would say, so I'm just going to find where I am in my notes here. He said, he said, "The gospel came to you not in word only, but also in power and the Holy Ghost and much assurance." Praise the Lord. So if now if you have received the gospel, there is a life of power. Amen. And much assurance has come to your soul. If you've really received it now, intellectually that's one thing. But when it's really received by faith into your heart, you'll see the power of God begin to move in your life. You'll see things which once bothered you don't bother you anymore. You'll see overcoming power manifest. Amen. Because God is not a weak God. He doesn't just leave us with an intellectual understanding with no victory. He wants the victory he won on Calvary to be manifest in you and I. Amen. that you can look back and see the things that once bothered me, they don't bother me no more. Why? Because you have received the holy, you have received the word, the gospel, not in just word only. Because remember, dead dead sermons kill. &gt;&gt; Dead messages kill, but living ones bring life. Amen. I tell you, just the word only without the anointing, people have killed millions around the world with it. All the way down through church history, dead script, you people just quoting the word dead no life has killed many. Amen. Dead quotes without the life behind it have killed many people. People have taken the word of God which is meant to give life and brought death because the Holy Ghost has not been there when they've done it. We must never get carnal with this gospel. Amen. Because when you get carnal, you just want to win the argument. The Holy Ghost takes his flight cuz he says, "I don't want to be associated with this. I'm not part of this kind of carry on. I'm the love of God. Amen. So, if you really want God to live, have a have a feeling for who you're talking to. They may be arguing against you, they may even hate you. Amen. But you should be have such a feeling for them. Lord, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. Amen. And what happens then? Life can come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the letter kleth, but the spirit giveth life. Amen. Now, what does this meal offering do? As I said, the um as I said, the priests, they they parttook of it. It will produce what's in the offering comes into you and it will produce the life of Christ. Amen. As brother Amwood said, what is the shout? Uh it's the message going forth first. The living bread of life bringing forth the bride. Amen. So when you receive the word, Amen. in faith, it will produce the bride of Jesus Christ in you. Praise the Lord. You are what you eat. Amen. If you just eating debates and fasting and fighting, you become that. Amen. But if you if you if you receive the living word, it will produce the bride of Jesus Christ. I mean why? Because you and your sacrifice become one. Praise the Lord. I like that. Don't you? Now also also this meal offering brings life. I mean when it's mixed with death, it brings life. Just like Elisha in second kings when there's the school of the prophets and you know they get a big pot and you know even you know Elisha instructs them to to to cook something and and one of the one of them go out to gather herbs and different things but he just grabs a grabs a lap full of wild gourds. He doesn't realize what he's going to put in this pot. And then when it starts cooking maybe the smell or something they said to Elisha, "Oh, there's death in the pot." But you see Elisha had the meal offering. &gt;&gt; Amen. Elisha was carrying this meal offering. So there was death and he didn't say now throw it out and start again. He said just just mix the meal offering with this pot of death and it'll bring forth life. Now if you have Christ as the meal offering in your life, what happens is there'll be once your testimony was actually brought without God in it just brings death, brings complexes. You join other people's bitterness and resentment and you just bring death upon death upon death. But then when Christ comes into your life, it's actually it was death but now it's life. Amen. that your testimony can encourage, can inspire, can strengthen, can bring faith. Amen. Can bring the life of God into someone's life. Amen. Where it's not critical no more, but it's a living testimony. You're a living, breathing, walking testimony. Amen. That God can use. Amen. What happens is now the meal offering that's within you, now you pass it into a pot of death. Someone who's, you know, dead in trespasses and sins, God can use you to bring life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I like that. Amen. This is what you know. So, you know, and and it's like anything in life, the meal offering represent Christ. I'm just going to start reading halfway down. And when death is on, Christ was put in itsstead and death turns to life again. Don't you see? So, the same pottage, he didn't say, "Dump it out. We'll get some more. Just take that same one." And so, when a cancer has come to your life or some sickness that the doctors, the medical science can't control, don't give up. The meal offering is still ours. The Lord Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Throw Christ into your life with faith and it'll turn from death to life every time. It just can't fail because it's the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, you're going through something, just bring life into it. Bring that meal offering, the word. Bring Christ into your situation and it'll turn death to life. What the devil intended for evil, God turns it for good. Amen. To strengthen your testimony, strengthen your um, you know, strengthen your confidence like we heard on Wednesday, that masterpiece. Thank you very much for that, brother Isaac. Appreciated that. Amen. Do you see? It increases our confidence. Amen. In the Lord. Praise the Lord. So, you see why this needs to be in your life. Amen. It's the anointing. You become part of the sacrifice. It puts you in service. You should just see this living, right? Amen. And what does it do? It brings life. Changes death to life. This is why there's a lamentation that you know that you you're in and Joel there because these things are not in the house of God. I say it's been restored. &gt;&gt; Life has come. The anointing has come. People been put into service. Amen. God God has done great things. He's brought forth a word to make us the living living bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. To to cause us to recognize we are part of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you and the sacrifice become one. All Jesus is you become by his grace. Brother Bram says she is him. Amen. [snorts] Praise the Lord. When they left When they left Egypt, what happened? You didn't see the lamb. The lamb was killed. The blood was applied. They ate that lamb and they walked out in the strength of that lamb. So you saw the worshipper and his family and a lamb separate. After all said and done, you just saw the family go out. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they became one with the lamb. We become one with the word. &gt;&gt; All the strength of that lamb, all the vitamins. Guess why I believe your lamb tastes real good? &gt;&gt; Lamb is such a good meat and it wouldn't make sense to me if it was terrible, &gt;&gt; right? Because God represents himself as a lamb. Taste and see the Lord is good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm not mean that as a joke, but yeah. But I I have lamb. I'm like, Lord, this makes sense, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When you think about it, it makes sense. If it was some terrible, tough old thing that was disgusting, I said, Lord, this doesn't make sense. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because once you really taste of this meal offering, once you really taste of Christ, you see he is good. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now this now let's come back to we're talking about David and his mighty men. So David long so so so this is the drink offering, okay? That that he would that that David would pour out after after his men had after his men had you know fought through 15 miles of Philistines and brought this drink back. Now this this drink offering is all the way through the scripture and it and it begins in Genesis 35 when Jacob you know you know he's there asleep there he's on the run from his uh brother there he's asleep there and then you know he sees that uh staircase from heaven right the angels ascending and descending and then after that he realized that this was a place where God was the entrance to heaven and um and and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him even a pillar of stone and poured a drink offering thereon and poured oil thereon and Jacob called the plum name of the place where God spake with him Bethl. Okay, so this is the first time a drink offering is poured out. Now when a drink offering a drink offering once it's poured out, you cannot take it back. It represents a surrendered life to God. This is what a drink offering really is. Okay? It's a fully surrendered life to God. And I believe God has made prisoners in this day of love. Brother Brown would preach a servant sermon Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ. As Paul would say many times, Paul a prisoner if you read through the epistles that he wrote. And what he what happened is Paul became an offering a drink offering to the Lord. Now we know Jesus Christ is the ultimate drink offering. He poured his life out that day on Calvary. Amen. And when he said, he said, "Other sheep I have which uh um are not of this fold, them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd." He's talking about you in that scripture. Praise the Lord. Therefore, doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I may take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down in myself. I have power to lay it down. I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my father. So, he's based my life out. And the reason I'm going to pour my life out is because I've got other sheep that need to hear my voice. There's going to be one fold and one shepherd. And so he gave his life on Calvary. And and and it wasn't taken from him. This was a free will offering. No one forced Jesus to go to Calvary. The Pharisees didn't. The Romans didn't. None of them none of them forced him. He he he willingly let his life be poured out. Amen. For you and I. And it wasn't just partially poured out. It was a complete offering. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When he died, he said, "It is finished." He's basically saying, "I've fully poured my life out. I've purchased the salvation of my people. I purchased the redemption of Adam's fallen race. It is done." Amen. And what happened? He poured himself out without measure, incompleteness. And the reason he did that is that he would gather his people to himself. Praise the Lord. So no man, no man forced him to do it. And it's the same thing with you and I. No one can force another person to give their life completely. This is not a thing where we force someone you must, you have to conform to this way, you better shape up or ship out. This is not how the gospel works. There's a drawing power of the gospel. Amen. The word of God draws people. Jesus said, "If I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto myself." Amen. Brother Brand, when he talked about the three pulls, it wasn't the three pushes, the three shves, the three whatevers. It was it was three pulls. And those three pulls were to pull the bride of Jesus Christ ultimately. And that third pull, the opening of the word. Amen. What that do? That was going for the prize fish. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are that prize fish. You're the one he's looking for for the master's table. Amen. So, so when the word comes open, like, you know, for myself, when I first heard, Brother Brandham, it wasn't the miracles that got a hold of me. It was the word. It was Jesus Christ speaking personally to me. I mean, I couldn't I couldn't describe it necessarily, but you know, it wasn't the miracles that were like, man, this is this is God and this, you know, sure it was, but it was the word of God. It was the Jesus Christ revealing himself and what and and it didn't push me. He pulled me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, just let God pull you to himself. Amen. If there's part of his word you haven't surrendered to, say, "Lord, pull me to that. I'm going to give up and let and let you fulfill your word in my life." Amen. If you haven't been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, surrender to it cuz he's pulling you to it. Amen. He's not pushing you. He's pulling you to himself. I'd say I would give up and let him pull you. &gt;&gt; I mean, like a fish you're fighting. Now, I'm no fisherman, so I can't really talk about this much, but there's some fish that fight a lot. There's some fish that don't fight too much. But all of them eventually have to give up, &gt;&gt; right? you they they can dive and they can run and they can all these things, but eventually like a maron or whatever, but eventually that marlin quits. &gt;&gt; It gets pulled to the boat. You got a predestinated hook in your mouth. &gt;&gt; Actually, not in your mouth, in your heart. Right? Whether you know it or not, there's an anchor beyond the veil. Amen. It was put there before the foundation of the world. Amen. And God is pulling you. &gt;&gt; He's drawing you to his word. Amen. And you may run, but you'll just get tired. I just quit and just let God live in your life for more than you would if you just make a deathbed confession. There's no victory in that as opposed to God living through you. Sure, you're saved, but why why wait for a deathbed confession? I'd rather make it secure right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have no trouble at the river right now. Amen. Give your life completely. Let your life be poured out as a drink offering &gt;&gt; like his was. Amen. Paul would say this is the King James version. And in the top he says, "For now I'm ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand." Now, in virtually every other translation there is, for I am already being poured out. Why? Because Paul was a prisoner. He let his life be poured out for Christ as an offering, as a response back to God. God, you poured your life out for me, so Lord, you can pour my life out for you. Amy says, I'm already being poured out in the time of my release hath arrived. Amen. Praise the Lord. He knew you his time of departure, but he says it's my time of release. I I'm no longer bound in these bodies. I want to go to be with the Lord. Sure, it's a benefit me being here, but I want to be there. Amen. And when you pour your life out, you're like, Lord, there's a purpose I have upon the earth. And Lord, I want you to fulfill that purpose in my life. Amen. But when it's done, Lord, take me home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because you've poured out your life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, these men, this is a sign. This is a sign that there's a life that's been poured out where David did not command these mighty men to go get him a drink. Maybe he's just in his tent. Maybe he walked out there and he looked down. Maybe he could see Bethlehem from where he was. I'm not sure. He's up in the hold. He looked down. He saw Bethlehem and just a cry came out. Maybe it wasn't that loud. I don't know. But he said, "Oh, I just wish I could have a drink from that well of Bethlehem. You know, the one by the gate." Cuz he thought, you know, he remembered his childhood. remember drinking from that well as a boy and thirsty hot day. He would drink from that feeling so refreshed and you know he just said, "Oh, if I could just have that, you know, and then but that stirred that desire became a commandment to his mighty men because his mighty men loved him. They knew he was coming into power. They knew he was God's anointed man. And his desire became like a commandment to them and it stirred them up. Say, "Boys, we're going to go get our king a drink." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We don't just want to let him here with a longing. We want to fulfill his longing. We want to fulfill his joy. Amen. So they pulled their sword. Amen. Pull your weapons, boys. We're going to Oh, but the garrison's around there. Who cares? Our king wants a drink. Amen. So what did they do? They cut through 15 miles of flesh, 15 miles of Philistines. Amen. To get their king a fresh drink of water. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And friends, I tell you what, God is looking for a people today &gt;&gt; to cut through every every tradition. every creed, your upbringing, your culture, all those things that would restrict you from giving your complete life to Jesus Christ. He says, "And then there those warriors grabbed them swords. David cried out for a fresh drink of water. They cut their way through 15 mi of men to get him a drink of water. And David poured out upon the ground a sacrifice, a drink offering." Yes, warriors today, Jesus wants a drink of good, cold Pentecostal fresh water. these denominational stagnated waters is is is sickening to him. Take the word of God, pull it and cut through all these creeds and things till we can hit that place where there's a fresh drink for him. What is that fresh drink? A real true worship, a genuine heart where he can pour down his make his word live in this day. That's what mean. That's what it means to give God a drink of fresh Pentecostal cold water, a real true worship, a genuine heart. That's why you got to cut through that Philistine of of of ought, of discontent, of of fussing, fighting, complexes, culture, whatever more. You got to cut through those things when you realize God wants a genuine place where a genuine heart, a genuine faith that he can pour down his word to make it live in this day. &gt;&gt; I think it's worth cutting through. &gt;&gt; I think it's worth going, "Oh, but my culture is, you know, reserved and quiet. My last name's that." Why should that define you? Why should where we're born define us of how we should worship God? Why should anything dictate to us but God how we should worship? &gt;&gt; Oh, but what will someone say? You got to dance past the critics. You to go beyond that sound barrier of criticism. What will that person think of you? Well, if you break through the sound barrier and you let God really be God in your life, it might get a hold of the critic and make him a worshshiper. Brother Ram saw saw, you know, a guy was what playing on a washboard. Don't know how that works. and a sister was dancing in the spirit on the platform and he was sitting there criticizing it. But then God in his grace brought him back into the scripture where dancing was a sign of victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? He started joining in too. Amen. So someone who's cold and indifferent. You want to get that person on fire for God, you start breaking through every barrier, amen, of pride of, well, what will that person think? If they're spiritual, they'll think a lot of you. If they can't, well, they'll hopefully get converted, right? So, why should we let those things dictate, well, I've had a bad day. I've had a bad week. I've got a bad life. Let God change that. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has saved you. &gt;&gt; God has redeemed you. Amen. God has kept you. Amen. God's given you victory. We worship God because of who he is. &gt;&gt; More than just what he's done. We worship because of who he is. He's the almighty God. He made heavens and earth. Amen. He made you. He made a way for you to get back to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's always been faithful and true. &gt;&gt; He's always been true to his word. Amen. He's never lost a battle. Amen. He's always been there for you. Even if you're out in the world somewhere, he was watching over you. Amen. Because you're part of him. Amen. He's always You've never been out of his care. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm not feeling too much right now." It's revelation. &gt;&gt; It's not by feelings. It's by revelation. Amen. So, why not, friends, let go? Why not? Why don't we have a genuine heart? &gt;&gt; Forget the religious politics. Forget the message politics. Forget about what this person's done. What has Jesus done to you? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Start thinking on those things. And then you'll get a joy and a victory. Amen. And you have a genuine heart. Lord, I don't know why you saved me, but you did. &gt;&gt; I don't know why you ever loved me, but I'm so glad you did. I mean, I was running away from you, Lord, but you didn't just quit and say, "Well, there goes another one." No, you pursued me, Lord. I mean, you got a hold of my life, Lord Jesus. Amen. What does that do? That produces a genuine heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. That he can pour his word. He can pour down his make his word live in this day. He'll have it. &gt;&gt; He said he would. If he said he'll have it, well, why not have it, Lord? Have it here, Lord. Make this quote personal to me, Lord. The prophet was talking about somebody. I'm here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who he was referring to, you know, like Mary realized after the angel came her way, it's me. &gt;&gt; Isaiah was talking about me. Hallelujah. Should we not see the same thing in the word about ourselves &gt;&gt; when he said there'd be a bride without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of the lamb? Amen. Should we not say he was talking about me? &gt;&gt; I'm not a I'm not sure about the person next to me, but he's talking about me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. He said he would restore the faith of the people back to the father's faith of the children. Malachi 4 tells us it'll come and it'll be there. Don't you worry. It'll be it'll be right there. God has done said so. So that's all. I like that. Amen. Oh Gentiles though, I said, "Who will pull the sword with me?" He wants a fresh drink this morning. Not this old stagnated church creeds and things we're fooling around with. He wants genuine faith in his word. This is getting him a fresh drink. He wants genuine faith in his word. Who will believe every word of it? Let's go to the well and bring back a drink of refreshment. A worship that's built upon not creeds and denomination, but a genuine spirit worship where Christ among us living his life the way he wants to among us. That's not with creeds and different things. Let's just have him that way. &gt;&gt; That's getting him a drink, a fresh drink of water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you want that? Yes. &gt;&gt; See, it said in Joel, "Those things weren't in the church." Why? I say, "We're being restored back." Amen. Those things are now in the church. Amen. There's a genuine people with a genuine heart that have a genuine love and a genuine faith for God. And they're sitting in front of me this morning. God is restored. You are his drink offering cuz Christ is in you. You are the life poured out. It's no longer I that liveth, but Christ that liveth in me. Praise the Lord. I want to say I'm just going to finish with this. I'm going to finish with this quote. We're going to wind up just now. He says, "You just put one or two good members in a church." So these ones that have the meal and the drink offering in them, you have Christ, okay? You just put one or two good members in a church that's really on fire for God. We don't need to have a majority. Oh, but this person and the church is going this way and but but what about you? &gt;&gt; If the whole church gets cold, I'm not joining you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if if half of everyone gets all political and all fussy and rigid and the you know the cood becomes actually not what God put it for but just to restrict everything, I ain't going with you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay with the word of God. Now, I'm not saying you're going that way, but but we can't go with the crowd. It's me and God. &gt;&gt; It's me and God. Fellowship is two men in a ship and it's me and God in that ship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we just join our boats together, right? But you see, it's you and God. &gt;&gt; How are you and God doing today? He's doing real good. Amen. You just put one or two good members in a church. See, we can never, and I know this goes everywhere, so I just challenge everyone. We can't complain if our church is cold. &gt;&gt; We can't complain that even if our church is dead. You put one or two good members. You say, "Lord, I want to be that one or two good members." &gt;&gt; That Lord, you can make a difference in this community. You can make a difference in this group. Amen. That God can live through me. If no one else wants it, Lord, I want it. Lord, I want you to live in my life, Lord. That you can pour your word in and live through me. Amen. that when you when a need arises, what happens? That person can meet you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, we must never ever get caught up in fusses. See, fusses are nothing. &gt;&gt; They're just fusses. Never get caught up in negative things. It's ne it doesn't help nobody. Let's stay with the positive. What has Jesus done for you? &gt;&gt; You know, there's a reason we have eternity to praise him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The millennium's going to feel short. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, where did that where'd that time go? It's been a thousand years, you know. I'm just getting started. That's fine. Soon you'll have no time cuz time will be no more &gt;&gt; and you'll have all the time in the world if I put it that way. But you see, there's a reason we're not going to get bored in heaven. &gt;&gt; We have so much to thank God for. Why not start now? &gt;&gt; Oh, one day when I'm surrounded by the angels and I'm surrounded by the saints and you know, and I'm really in the presence of God, you're in the presence of God now. &gt;&gt; Amen. The closest you get to heaven is when you and God come together. Amen. You're in the presence of heaven. You're in the presence of the angels. Amen. So why not start enjoying him now? Why not get the practice up? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's carnal. Just relax. &gt;&gt; Why not practice now? Oh, one day I'll really be able to. What you are here is what you are there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So why not? Why not start being here what you are there? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have a revelation that you're with Job when the morning stars, sons of God, shouted for joy before the foundation of the world, why not say, "God, manifest that in time in the presence of my enemy. Lord, manifest that in time to prove the power of your blood." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Why not? I think let's just be Let's just do it. I think it's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sit down. I'm going to finish this cuz I like it. Now, you just put one or two good members in a church that's really on fire for God. &gt;&gt; Who's going to be that one or two? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll do something for that church. More than 40 revival you could have. &gt;&gt; And we all want revival, do we not? But one or two good members. What about 10? What about 20? What about however many people are here? What about that? We're all good members on fire for God. What would that do? &gt;&gt; Oh my. God would just come down. Hallelujah. Be such an atmosphere of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just lose ourselves in the spirit of God. We'd walk out of these doors full of his goodness, fat and flourishing, praising God. I mean, just living off the goodness of God every day. Mondayitis wouldn't bother us cuz everything everything's in perspective now cuz God is good. &gt;&gt; I mean, you may be in boring Monday, but hey, praise the Lord, it's Monday. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a song and if I could sing, I'd sing it. There's a song, one more day. One more day. Lord, you've given me one more day to testify of your grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that song because we have one more day. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord on this side. So it would do more than 40 revivals you could have, right? A good cleansed member set an example and with her face shining with the glory of God, with sweetness and humility to stand there in the power of God and watch when somebody gets sick, they'll call that person to come pray. Or you might make fun of them. Um you might make fun of them and their tire is deflated so forth. You might all this nonsense say, "But let but let death strike you one time." You'll find out when them struggles begin to come who that real sincere person is in the church. He says, "Here I am, Lord. Send me. Let my influence be upon others. Lord, let me for me to live as Christ to die as gain. Let this word influence me." And my prayer is, Lord, while I'm in this valley here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of the Maricopa Valley, I say, or the hut valley, right? The little sunspot of the world. May I be able to be in contact with the son of God that would scatter sunshine of the Holy Spirit throughout the valley and will cause brethren and women and sisters and even sinners to find this fountain filled with blood. &gt;&gt; You going to be like that. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, if Christ is in you, &gt;&gt; the meal offering is in you, you'll be able forth, life will come forth, you'll be put into action. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? You are his drink offering. &gt;&gt; A life poured out &gt;&gt; that God can live. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's have the musicians, please, this morning. &gt;&gt; Leave it there. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I was going to rewrite that scripture in Joel 1:13, you know, but I just didn't do it. But we can instead of lamenting, we can rejoice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Instead of mourning, we can shout. Amen. Why? Because these offerings are not withholden in the house of the Lord. In our house, they are there. They're in abundance. They're manifesting themselves. Amen. We can rejoice. We're not We're not clothed in sackcloth. We're clothed in garments of praise. We're clothed in the garments of his righteousness, the robes of his righteousness. Amen. We have been restored. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's uh stand this morning. I think if we can sing that song again, I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life.

Oh, precious Lord, I pray dear God, you touch every man, woman, and child here. Lord, you see the hands that are raised the desire between every uh h behind every hand. Oh God, meet that desire. I pray, Lord, we want to be poured out. We want to be able to stand there like Paul and say we are our lives are poured out. Hallelujah Lord Jesus. Lord, we want to be that one or two good, sainted, clean, full of fire of God people in the church. Lord, that's better than 40 revivals. Lord God, send us, Lord. Put us into service like never before. Father, may the joy of the Lord be our strength like never before. Father, Lord, that fruit wouldn't wither, dear God, but it would flourish. It would revive. It would grow. It multiply because there's joy of the Lord in our souls. Father, we love you so much. I just pray you touch every life here. May you dismiss us with your blessing, dear God. And may we realize whatever we're fighting, you've already overcome it that hour on Calvary. Lord, you said it is finished, Lord. You conquered all things that day. And Lord, you're here to manifest your victory in our lives. Doesn't matter how big the giant, big the mountain. We're so thankful, Lord. Those things will fall at our feet because you've conquered it that day. Dear God, we're so thankful, not bigger in your house, but we're your children. We're your bride. And we come here to say thank you, Lord, for your blood. Thank you for your mercy. Thank you for your goodness, oh God. Thank you, Lord, for your overcoming power, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah, my God.

Thank you for eternal life. Hallelujah, Lord God. Thank you for living in us and through us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the salvation of our homes. Thank you for the healing of the sick.
