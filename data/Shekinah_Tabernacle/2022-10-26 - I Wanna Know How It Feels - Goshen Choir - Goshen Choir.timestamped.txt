[0:30] my mom and daddy talked about going home
[0:35] since I was just a babe on their knees
[0:39] they said that nothing compares to what
[0:43] was waiting up there how one day we
[0:46] would finally be free
[0:49] well I've never seen it but I'll keep on
[0:54] believing it will be a place like I've
[0:57] never known I'll keep my eyes on the sky
[1:01] cause my soul wants to fly Lord my heart
[1:06] is already gone

[1:50] sometimes I get weary from this life
[1:54] that I live it seems that he says
[1:57] something I'll never find
[2:00] I try to lighten my Lord but all that
[2:03] I've got to show is 700 things on my
[2:08] mind
[2:09] well I'm seeing visions of a crystal
[2:13] clear River where since forgotten
[2:16] Without a Trace

[3:17] [Music]

[3:37] [Music]
[3:41] [Applause]
