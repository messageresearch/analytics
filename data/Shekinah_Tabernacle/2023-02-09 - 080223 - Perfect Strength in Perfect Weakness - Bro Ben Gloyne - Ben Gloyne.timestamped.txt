[34:32] amen thank you musicians thank you
[34:34] brother David amen God bless you I
[34:37] thought it's very uh interesting how how
[34:40] we had the Oppa Duo and I don't know why
[34:42] it's the last service you've got to
[34:43] bring out those kind of songs but praise
[34:45] God we thank thank you for that but it's
[34:47] interesting uh the first line I think is
[34:49] our week but I but but I'm I mean I am
[34:51] weak but Thou Art strong
[34:53] and I want to take a thought of perfect
[34:55] strength and perfect weakness tonight as
[34:57] we as we go to prayer so let's go to
[35:00] Hebrews chapter 11. I want to take a
[35:03] we'll just take one scripture here
[35:04] Hebrews 11 and I have it here it's
[35:07] Hebrews 11 and 33 to 35.
[35:11] um very powerful sermon of of of the
[35:15] Prophet perfect strength and perfect
[35:17] weakness and I I believe it applies for
[35:19] every moment in time
[35:22] I mean so Hebrews 11 and 33 35 I mean
[35:26] great to have Brother Andy back and
[35:27] praise God sound like the Lord's moving
[35:29] in Dunedin so we're really excited for
[35:31] that amen praise God Amen that's awesome
[35:33] so great to have you home my friend God
[35:35] bless you amen Hebrews 11 and 33 to 35
[35:39] it says this here who through faith
[35:41] subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness
[35:43] obtained promises stop the mouths of
[35:45] lions quenched the violence of fire
[35:47] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[35:49] weakness were made strong wax Valiant
[35:51] and fight turned to flight the armies of
[35:53] the aliens women received their dead
[35:55] race to life again and others were
[35:57] tortured not accepting Deliverance that
[35:59] they might obtain a better Resurrection
[36:02] amen let's just uh yes if you could put
[36:04] verse 34 back up this is where I want to
[36:07] take my thoughts from Outer weakness
[36:08] were made strong
[36:09] so it's very uh powerful I mean let's um
[36:12] if who has a need tonight we have quite
[36:15] a few prayer requests already in so
[36:16] we're gonna have a time of prayer
[36:17] there's a prayer service tonight but
[36:19] amen if you have a knee you want to
[36:20] raise your hand to the Lord unless just
[36:21] approach him now as we've come into His
[36:24] presence dear Lord Jesus you are our
[36:26] great king
[36:27] you are the high King Of Heaven Lord you
[36:29] are the alpha and omega Lord there's no
[36:31] one besides thee Lord Jesus you're the
[36:33] great king of glory Lord you are alone
[36:36] the author of Salvation and we so
[36:38] thankful that by your shed blood we can
[36:40] come into your great presence tonight
[36:41] and we just want to pray Lord may you
[36:43] come O God and change our lives Lord we
[36:46] want to be surrendered to you Lord May

[36:51] image of your word oh God and we thank
[36:53] you Lord we can gather tonight Lord and
[36:55] we just want to pray you would have
[36:56] preeminence and just take over o God
[36:58] Lord that we would Lord that that we
[37:01] could say after the service we'd say all
[37:03] we saw was you shining through us oh God
[37:05] shining through every believer Lord
[37:07] Jesus that's what we want to see oh God

[37:19] need May touch them Lord Jesus and those
[37:21] who Lord who don't know you Lord may you
[37:23] meet them Father granted Lord and Jesus
[37:25] Christ's name amen God bless your
[37:28] friends you may have your seats tonight
[37:29] so I want to speak about as brother
[37:31] Brown preached a service perfect
[37:32] strength and perfect weakness and I
[37:35] found it very interesting here in
[37:36] Hebrews chapter 11 it says that out of
[37:38] weakness were made strong so they you
[37:41] know the world is very opposite when you
[37:42] think about what the world because
[37:44] because the world would say out of
[37:46] strength you'd get strength but when it
[37:48] comes to the believer it's out of
[37:49] weakness you're made strong and when and
[37:52] when we get perfect strength out of
[37:54] perfect weakness we know that that
[37:55] strength is not human strength that we
[37:57] get they did not they were not made
[37:59] strong humanly amen but it was a
[38:01] supernatural power of God that made them
[38:03] strong now I'm talking about more than
[38:05] physical strength because you know we
[38:07] have a strength that we can uh possess
[38:09] that is not human it's more than lifting
[38:11] rates uh weights or being like a Samson
[38:13] but we have a strength that can take us
[38:15] through every trial can can overcome
[38:17] every enemy now I was thinking this is
[38:18] quite a quite an opposite kind of a
[38:21] subject when you think about a message
[38:22] Fellowship of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[38:24] and how often we talk about how the
[38:26] devil's under our feet and all had
[38:28] powered heavens and earth has been
[38:29] placed in our hand and we've been made
[38:30] in His image and we're we're the
[38:32] Overcomers of this age and you know
[38:33] God's been waiting for us to take our
[38:35] position and the Rapture will go and you
[38:37] know but yet it's out of weakness that
[38:39] that can be made manifest amen where
[38:41] it's not it's not out of strength we get
[38:43] strength but it's out of weakness we're
[38:44] made strong
[38:46] but it's such a contrast to this day and
[38:48] age we live where where
[38:50] um when when our lord Jesus would would
[38:52] would show John in the Book of
[38:54] Revelation the he would describe the age
[38:56] we live in speaking the later CN age
[38:58] you'd say because they'll say so I'm
[39:00] rich increase with goods and have need
[39:01] of nothing and no it's not Thou Art
[39:03] Richard miserable poor and blind and
[39:05] naked so basically someone who says they
[39:07] have need of nothing they'd say I have
[39:08] strength I have all that I need I don't
[39:10] need any more than I have I have enough
[39:12] Amen to to walk through life and to walk
[39:15] a Victorious walk but I believe that we
[39:18] aren't a people that say we have need of
[39:19] nothing but I believe we're people that
[39:21] say Lord I need more of you Lord I
[39:23] cannot take another step Without You
[39:24] guiding my hand I can't I can't face
[39:26] life without you lord without you I am
[39:28] nothing oh God and Lord I I have no
[39:30] strength or ability in my own self and
[39:32] you know it's such an important thing
[39:34] always to realize that he is the vine
[39:36] and we are the branches and Jesus said
[39:38] without without me you can do nothing
[39:39] and how true that is
[39:42] who feels that way without the Lord we
[39:44] can't do anything now this does not mean
[39:46] we sit down in a pity party saying poor
[39:48] me I'm weak I'm useless I'm no good for
[39:50] nothing get that out of your head when
[39:52] I'm talking about weakness I'm not
[39:53] talking about oh look at me and woe is
[39:56] me and all these excuses like Moses had
[39:58] no weakness is a dependency upon God and
[40:01] if you're really that kind of a weakness
[40:03] then God can live through your life and
[40:05] then you become Strong by his strength
[40:08] amen so it's very important that we
[40:10] always are dependent upon our Lord that
[40:12] you know we know that sheep as we are
[40:14] likened under sheep sheep always need a
[40:16] Shepherd they always need a guide they
[40:18] can get lost very easily they can be you
[40:21] know even in their home kind of area
[40:22] they don't roam very far if they do they
[40:24] can get lost very easily they don't have
[40:26] a homing signal or a nature like a
[40:28] animal that will migrate sheep are very
[40:30] useless animals
[40:32] okay Hallelujah we don't have you know
[40:35] sheep don't have don't have big teeth or
[40:38] big claws or run fast or climb trees or
[40:40] you know they have no real natural
[40:41] defense mechanism and we're liking under
[40:44] that but a sheep that thinks they can do
[40:47] it all the big Ram who thinks it's got
[40:49] it all together that one's going to be
[40:50] taken out but the sheep that stick close
[40:52] to the shepherd they're the ones are
[40:54] gonna gonna survive the journey doesn't
[40:56] matter how big the Predator how you'll
[40:58] be a line or a bear whatever it may be
[40:59] amen if if we stick close to the
[41:02] shepherd because we realize without him
[41:04] we cannot walk amen we'll be strong
[41:07] praise God and you're glad we have a
[41:09] great Shepherd he's a present help in
[41:11] time of trouble amen he's not like these
[41:13] yeah I remember being this kind of age
[41:14] you know being on my
[41:16] um uncle's farm and my friend's Farms
[41:18] you know they're big stations up the
[41:19] east coast and you know we would be
[41:21] driving sheep from Paddock to Paddock
[41:23] and cattle and different things you know
[41:25] that's not how God leads us
[41:28] he doesn't drive us like that he doesn't
[41:30] use dogs and barking and noise and
[41:32] confusion to drive us down the road no
[41:34] he leads us he goes before us so we've
[41:36] got to realize that the trail run he's
[41:38] already walked into it he stepped into
[41:40] it before you ever stepped into it
[41:42] praise the Lord Jesus amen but it's very
[41:44] it's very important because this world
[41:46] is all about a super strength super
[41:49] intelligence you see people because of
[41:50] Technology can do and imagine things
[41:53] they could never do even a generation
[41:55] ago you know they talk about you know
[41:57] great great football stars like Pele
[41:59] that passed recently and you know you
[42:01] know what a what a mighty Sportsman he
[42:03] was but if you compare him to the
[42:05] Sportsman of today he's nothing you see
[42:07] the replays of the goals he did it looks
[42:09] like Amateur hour compared to the ones
[42:10] today why because there's a super
[42:12] ability now there's strength and
[42:14] training and people think that they you
[42:15] know it's their own strength it goes
[42:17] from strength to strength but with the
[42:19] Christian it goes from weakness to
[42:20] strength
[42:22] you know it's not intelligence that
[42:24] causes us to overcome you know we after
[42:26] brotherbraham says he says it's very
[42:28] important that that you know if we
[42:30] expect to fulfill God's desire in our
[42:32] life that we have to master the thought
[42:34] of human ability if we ever get to a
[42:37] spot where we think we can do it with
[42:38] our own intelligence and our own
[42:40] abilities we've got to master that in
[42:42] such a way that we can get rid of the
[42:43] thing and lay it aside so God can use us
[42:46] that's right and it might and make a
[42:49] complete surrender we cannot use one
[42:50] ability we have got to make a complete
[42:53] surrender and come to God we've got to
[42:55] surrender to him both Body Soul and
[42:56] Spirit everything that you are has to be
[42:59] surrendered to God in order that he can
[43:00] work his will and you and me so he says
[43:04] this is the first thing we've got to do
[43:05] he says especially to Young preachers
[43:06] and lay members alike is is if we expect
[43:09] to fulfill God's desire in our life as
[43:11] we have to master the thought of human
[43:13] ability now the thought of human ability
[43:15] means that we that we think it's our
[43:17] ability that can do the job
[43:19] like for example you know I've stood
[43:21] here for a few few Services now right
[43:23] this is not my first rodeo that yo our
[43:25] musicians our you know other brothers in
[43:27] the church Sunday school teachers you
[43:29] know this is not our first rodeo we are
[43:31] 10 years down the road now we've done a
[43:33] few things right but the danger with
[43:35] that is when we get to a place we think
[43:36] I can do this now
[43:38] I can do this now I know what to say I
[43:40] know the scripture I can put together a
[43:42] thought in a certain way and it's all
[43:43] human ability but we've got to master
[43:45] the thought that our human ability can
[43:47] actually make the kingdom of God go
[43:49] forward because it's not by a power or
[43:51] by might it's by his Spirit saith the
[43:53] Lord you know brother Braham says about
[43:55] this age well Jesus that he said we're
[43:56] rich increase with goods and people
[43:58] think it's it takes money to make the
[44:00] kingdom of God go forward it's never
[44:01] been money it's the spirit of God that
[44:04] makes the kingdom of God go forward it's
[44:05] not financial resources that actually
[44:08] matter as the spirit of God makes it go
[44:10] forward amen you see and you know
[44:13] I just gone by Believers have been dirt
[44:16] dirt poor have nothing but yet God moved
[44:18] in great power
[44:19] amen so we've got to realize it's not
[44:22] the number of figures in a bank account
[44:23] which gives us success it's the spirit
[44:25] of God that gives us success amen so we
[44:27] need to always keep that understanding
[44:29] we've got to master the thought of human
[44:30] ability you know because there's a
[44:33] there's a big difference between having
[44:35] an ability and having God use that
[44:37] ability or actually surrendering that
[44:39] ability to God so for example I can
[44:41] stand here and I could preach a whole
[44:43] series using my own ability
[44:45] and it may sound all very fine it may be
[44:47] completely correct but that's me using
[44:50] my ability or or singers can sing
[44:52] musicians can play song leaders can song
[44:55] Lead Sunday school teachers can be
[44:57] Sunday school teachers in their own
[44:58] human ability but when God takes that
[45:01] person he amends it at the end and
[45:03] that's what we're looking for is God to
[45:05] come down and amen the service right
[45:07] amen the song service where God's
[45:09] presence comes out amen especially where
[45:10] God anoints that special that's when
[45:12] that person has surrendered their human
[45:14] ability and God is using that person who
[45:17] wants to be like that where God amends
[45:19] your life see Jesus said that you're
[45:21] it's two witnesses it's me and my father
[45:23] we are the witnesses that what I'm
[45:25] saying is true why because Jesus spoke
[45:27] and then the Lord confirmed it through
[45:28] him it wasn't just Idle Words you know
[45:30] he could have been very eloquent or well
[45:33] we know the Common People heard him
[45:34] gladly but what I'm saying is he could
[45:36] have put it all together just perfectly
[45:37] but without God himself Amen in his
[45:40] ministry just like the prophet of God
[45:41] without God coming service after service
[45:43] Discerning the thoughts and Tents of the
[45:45] heart revealing people's needs
[45:46] supernaturally totally without he didn't
[45:49] have an equal in his time
[45:51] Tommy Osborne wasn't on the same level
[45:53] you know you know Billy Graham didn't
[45:55] have the same things you know oh Roberts
[45:57] wasn't on the same page as that unique
[45:58] Ministry thereby said without him I can
[46:01] do nothing that was brother Branham and
[46:03] he he mastered the thought of human
[46:05] ability and we must master that same
[46:07] thought where we think we can be the
[46:09] Christian our own selves we are licked
[46:10] we are defeated right there if you think
[46:12] you can put together the right answer
[46:14] and say well I know the scripture I know
[46:15] the message I know I know you've got a
[46:17] problem because you've got I in that
[46:19] sentence amen but if you know well I
[46:21] know the answer I know the author the
[46:23] author is the answer then he can use you
[46:25] if you're fully surrendered to him amen
[46:27] so we must Master this thought of human
[46:29] ability because what is this world full
[46:31] of human ability
[46:33] and look at the technology look at this
[46:35] you know you know back in my day we had
[46:38] dial-up modems when I was young we
[46:41] played we played games with other
[46:43] friends over dial up
[46:47] you know the internet was barely even a
[46:49] thing
[46:50] and look now we can't live without it
[46:52] you can be in virtual reality on the
[46:54] other side of the world it's just gone
[46:55] Quantum leap's way because man has used
[46:58] his own human ability to to to tap into
[47:01] these things and create them
[47:03] now if they can do that in the natural
[47:05] side how much more now people can
[47:06] surrender their human ability surrender
[47:08] their own selves that God can use them
[47:10] you see God has a lot of
[47:16] just because people have abilities
[47:19] God can't use those abilities
[47:21] God is not God didn't call you because
[47:23] of maybe you can speak well or maybe you
[47:25] can play well or maybe you can sing well
[47:27] or maybe you can pray well or maybe you
[47:30] can sympathize or love well no he didn't
[47:32] call you because of that see if you
[47:34] think you've got something to give to
[47:35] God to use you are not even in the
[47:37] picture with him you think look I've got
[47:39] this I can give you God God doesn't use
[47:41] it see the Apostle Peter had a lot of
[47:43] abilities
[47:45] but he was not made the spokesman you
[47:47] know in the book of Acts preaching the
[47:49] first ever first ever church service
[47:51] because of his abilities or his
[47:53] personality personality or ability
[47:55] doesn't place you in a position in the
[47:57] body of Christ God does many times as
[47:59] the person you think shouldn't be in
[48:00] that place is God's ordained person so
[48:03] so you know you know Peter had that kind
[48:05] of a nature where he is the first one to
[48:06] answer he was the only one who walked on
[48:08] water not once but twice you know he he
[48:11] he said Lord you know I'll I'll go with
[48:13] you to the death he didn't just say it
[48:14] he tried to kill that God The Sword in
[48:16] the garden and all those things but yet
[48:18] God had to bring him to such a place
[48:20] where he where where where where he got
[48:22] on such a road of failure
[48:25] because his own human abilities took him
[48:27] to that place of utter failure where
[48:29] where he denied the Lord three times
[48:30] when the Lord's being judged there in
[48:32] Jasmine Hall when the when the Lord
[48:34] really needed him he said I'm I'm going
[48:37] to be right there with you and he
[48:39] buckled under just some questioning of
[48:40] some women and stuff outside why because
[48:42] God had to bring him to a place that he
[48:45] realized himself his own human Ability
[48:47] Counts for nothing
[48:48] and that's the same thing with you and I
[48:50] we can be in church for a very long time
[48:52] and we can be fighting and fighting and
[48:54] God can be we can try and push forward
[48:56] we just get pushed back God just you
[48:58] know resist the proud We have trouble in
[48:59] grinding all these things going on but
[49:01] we think we can do it what's that God
[49:03] trying to get us to realize we're
[49:05] whipped that we can really come to him
[49:09] hello how how's everyone on Wednesday
[49:11] night because we're going to get to the
[49:12] place like Peter did amen but the thing
[49:15] about Peter the great thing about Peter
[49:17] is he even though he came to that point
[49:19] where he miserably failed you know he
[49:21] thought how can the Lord ever receive me
[49:23] again I've just failed him completely
[49:25] but yet he still went to him on that
[49:27] Resurrection morning when they're
[49:29] fishing even went back to his old life
[49:30] he realized his ability of a fisherman
[49:32] was a useless failure he caught fish in
[49:34] that same Lake he went to the same spots
[49:36] no doubt got nothing we're fished all
[49:38] night
[49:39] and he's got this Yo's Hearts like a
[49:41] lead balloon and his you know you know
[49:42] you know in his in his chest I failed
[49:45] the Lord he told me I'd deny but my
[49:47] pride said I wouldn't do it
[49:48] doesn't matter how strong-willed you are
[49:50] you'll come to a place where it comes to
[49:52] nothing and that's God's grace dude you
[49:54] know that that's actually God's grace
[49:55] when you come to the end of yourself
[49:56] when you're when it feels like you're
[49:58] hitting a head-butting a brick wall
[50:00] yeah why can't we get resolution in this
[50:02] why can't I get peace in this area why
[50:04] is it God's trying to get you to a place
[50:06] where you just raise your hands and say
[50:07] Lord
[50:09] here I am I've tried my own ability to
[50:12] make this right I've tried I've tried
[50:13] everything I can I've thought every
[50:15] different angle all different kind of
[50:16] things and God's saying the answer I
[50:18] have for you is not in your ability
[50:20] your ability is just making yourself
[50:22] miserable so why don't you just give him
[50:24] the ability and give them yourself in
[50:26] the same time and let him come in and
[50:28] take over your life
[50:29] but you see a difference with Peter as
[50:31] he went to the Lord anyway he jumped in
[50:32] he didn't wait for the others to get you
[50:34] know catch the lot whatever he just went
[50:36] straight to the Lord not knowing if
[50:37] he'll be received or not but he went
[50:38] anyway to me that's a true seed of God
[50:40] no matter how much we fail how much we
[50:43] fall in our faces we go to him anyway
[50:45] Hallelujah that's why the Lord would ask
[50:48] him Peter do you love me ask them three
[50:50] times I believe that because he denied
[50:52] them three times
[50:53] Hallelujah right but you see Peter had a
[50:56] lot of abilities but God couldn't use
[50:57] any of them
[50:58] but you see the reason that he was the
[51:00] spokesman on the uh you know the first
[51:02] ever church service is not because of
[51:04] his personality not because he has a
[51:06] Firebrand not because of his ability to
[51:08] speak or whatever more the reason he was
[51:11] a spokesman in the book of Acts there in
[51:12] Acts chapter 2 is because he was given
[51:14] the keys to the kingdom
[51:15] because the other member remember
[51:17] remember he he was the first one to
[51:18] answer when they said who do you say I
[51:20] am he says Thou Art the Christ the son
[51:22] of living God and and you know Jesus
[51:24] said bless are you Simon bar Jonah
[51:26] ability hasn't given this to you your
[51:28] own gray matter hasn't worked this out
[51:29] it wasn't your human ability that made
[51:31] you realize I'm the Christ it wasn't the
[51:33] apostles it wasn't the general trending
[51:35] thoughts on Twitter that got you here it
[51:38] was a revelation for my Father in Heaven
[51:40] it says Upon This Rock of Revelation
[51:42] I'll build my church you see we've got
[51:44] to come to a place the scribes and
[51:45] Pharisees had a lot of theological
[51:47] ability but they couldn't identify the
[51:49] Messiah in their midst but you see Jesus
[51:51] said to Peter you know and and I'll give
[51:53] you the keys to the kingdom what do you
[51:55] bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven
[51:57] what's loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[51:58] heaven and we know a key opens a door
[52:01] and he used that key three times
[52:03] and it opened the door to all the
[52:05] kingdoms I mean all the peoples of the
[52:07] Earth the Jews the Samaritans which are
[52:09] half Jew and Gentile and the Gentiles
[52:10] don't know why I'm raising four fingers
[52:12] facing
[52:14] yes somehow I got through maths I don't
[52:16] know how that worked out praise God
[52:18] anyway but you see he opened that door
[52:20] why because he said on the day of
[52:21] Pentecost so the Jews repent be baptized
[52:23] everyone you're in the name of Jesus
[52:24] Christ for the remission of sin and you
[52:26] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[52:28] In other words repent be baptized in his
[52:30] name and this key is going to open the
[52:32] door you'll receive the kingdom of God
[52:34] which is the Holy Ghost the king of God
[52:35] is within you then he went down to to
[52:37] Philip was in Samaria well half Jew and
[52:40] gentile people laid his hands upon them
[52:42] they received the Holy Ghost then he was
[52:44] sent to cornelius's house the Gentiles
[52:46] and there's his preaching the Holy Ghost
[52:47] fell upon them then they got baptized
[52:49] the same way in the name of Jesus Christ
[52:50] what he opened he used those keys to the
[52:53] Jews the Gentiles and the Samaritans to
[52:54] the whole world and that and that
[52:56] approach to God still works today who
[52:58] can testify of that
[52:59] Hallelujah so you see now the reason he
[53:02] was a spokes from the book of Exodus not
[53:03] because of Personality not because of
[53:05] ability because because God gave him the
[53:07] keys to the kingdom amen now it's
[53:10] amazing where where how we have to come
[53:12] to a spot where we don't lean on upon
[53:15] some great person
[53:16] brother and says in the same um message
[53:18] when we're expecting saying this guy
[53:20] he's a great person this is a great
[53:22] person I'll just lean upon him that
[53:24] deplete displeases God when you do that
[53:26] we must lean upon God and God Alone we
[53:29] mustn't trust the ability of ourselves
[53:30] or any man we must completely yield to
[53:33] God
[53:34] so you know
[53:36] we can't we can't be caught up in our
[53:38] favorite preacher I'll just lean upon
[53:40] him he really knows this stuff the Lord
[53:42] really uses him and I'm just going to
[53:44] trust in him and no no that displeases
[53:46] God
[53:47] because we elevate a part of the body to
[53:50] a place where it should never be where
[53:52] our affections our attentions go on what
[53:54] he's saying and then someone can stand
[53:56] on here like on a Wednesday and just
[53:58] kind of spread some words out you know
[54:01] and God can be working in exactly the
[54:03] same manner see so we can't have you
[54:05] know the days have gone where we gather
[54:07] around a Ministry
[54:09] we're called together on Jesus Christ
[54:11] the word
[54:12] right Jesus Christ the word see that's
[54:14] that's who we must lean upon is Jesus
[54:16] Christ the word not to be caught up
[54:18] brother Ram said I'm here I'm I I'm here
[54:20] to allow a platform for someone great to
[54:22] come after me who was that that was
[54:24] Jesus Christ the word as John the
[54:26] Baptist 4 on the first coming of Christ
[54:27] so his ministry for around the second
[54:29] what did John do introduce the Lamb of
[54:30] God to the people then he went off the
[54:32] scene what did Brother Brown do
[54:33] introduce the Lamb of God Jesus Christ
[54:35] the word to the people then he went off
[54:36] the scene right so it's the word that
[54:38] we're caught up and not in the
[54:40] personality of a man amen if we lean
[54:42] upon a person it will displease God
[54:46] Isaiah was a great prophet but he had a
[54:49] bad influence in his life of actually a
[54:51] Godly King Uriah or uziah if I've got
[54:53] that right you see he was he was so
[54:56] influenced by this King he leaned on him
[54:58] too much but God had to open up
[55:01] basically the Bible within a book
[55:03] because of 66 chapters in Isaiah 66
[55:06] books in the Bible and if you look in
[55:08] the book of Isaiah he goes from you know
[55:10] the beginning you know even before where
[55:12] he says you know Lucifer that son of the
[55:14] morning but you'll cut down all those
[55:15] things Isaiah 14 then he talks about
[55:17] John the Baptist talks about the Messiah
[55:19] he talks about new heavens and new earth
[55:20] so the whole Bible's within that book
[55:22] right but you see God had to get him
[55:25] from out of the influence of the king
[55:27] that God could speak to him why because
[55:29] he was leaning upon the king too much
[55:32] that's why God had to take that King out
[55:34] of the way
[55:35] and that's the same thing with us if we
[55:37] lean upon a person too much well that
[55:40] person
[55:41] see you bye
[55:43] because God wants your attention he
[55:45] wants to speak to you he wants to walk
[55:46] with you he doesn't want you to walk
[55:48] through a Ministry amen remember
[55:50] remember we don't worship God through a
[55:52] church like denominations we'll go to a
[55:54] church they think they're worshiping God
[55:55] through that church but we worship God
[55:57] through the word
[55:59] right we approach God through his word
[56:01] not through a church who's with me who
[56:03] understands the difference right we're
[56:05] not here to worship God through a Creed
[56:06] or denomination where our Founders a
[56:08] million years ago did this no we worship
[56:10] God through the Living Word
[56:12] that's why the thing is if this place
[56:14] cease to be I trust and pray that we'll
[56:17] keep all of us will keep walking on with
[56:19] God
[56:19] we may move to different places whatever
[56:21] I'm not saying it will fall apart what
[56:23] I'm saying is I trust you're not a
[56:25] Believer because of these four walls if
[56:27] you're a Believer because of these four
[56:28] walls we have miserably I have miserably
[56:30] failed
[56:32] but if you're a Believer because you
[56:33] have a true experience with Jesus Christ
[56:35] according to his word and you walk with
[56:36] him I've succeeded
[56:39] Hallelujah I can just rest and praise
[56:41] God
[56:42] amen isn't that right I mean because
[56:43] that's why I wanted for people to have
[56:45] an individual Walk With Jesus Christ the
[56:47] word amen not be caught up in a
[56:49] personality of a person or a preacher
[56:51] whatever more those days are gone praise
[56:53] God and they should stay gone
[56:55] I mean there's some things that's got a
[56:57] big sticker do not resuscitate on it's
[56:59] one of them
[57:00] amen you see now we have to come to a
[57:03] spot like Isaiah where influences are
[57:06] gone
[57:07] and then God can speak to us
[57:09] and then when he got into God's presence
[57:11] he confessed the insufficiency of the
[57:13] people in his own abilities when you get
[57:16] into the prince of God you realize
[57:17] you've got nothing to offer
[57:19] but yet the coal of fire came in and
[57:21] cleansed his lips cleansed them and then
[57:22] God said he'll go for us he just said
[57:24] Lord I here I am send me he didn't say
[57:27] you know God I've got the credentials
[57:29] I'm a prophet you know you've kind of
[57:30] spoken to me before I've got ability
[57:31] I've got influence with the king and you
[57:33] know no no none of that he said why was
[57:36] me
[57:36] I I'm a man of unclean lips I live in a
[57:39] Land of unclean people he realized his
[57:42] own insufficiency and it's a great place
[57:44] to be when you realize you're all
[57:46] insufficient
[57:47] now that that feeling or that
[57:49] recognition doesn't make yourself a pity
[57:51] party saying well I'm just useless
[57:53] throwing me away God that's wrong that's
[57:54] Pride right but when you realize you're
[57:56] insufficient he can come into your life
[57:58] and be the sufficient one
[58:01] yes amen I've got a scripture here it
[58:02] says here in um
[58:04] second Corinthians uh three and three to
[58:06] six he says for as much as we are
[58:08] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[58:10] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[58:13] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[58:15] God not in tables of stone but in
[58:17] fleshly tables of the heart and such
[58:19] trust uh have we through Christ to
[58:22] godward not that we are sufficient of
[58:24] ourselves to think anything as of
[58:26] ourselves but our sufficiency is of God
[58:29] now you think about who's writing this
[58:31] this is the Apostle Paul this is the
[58:34] Apostle Paul writing this is the this is
[58:36] the man that God allowed to to to
[58:37] position law and Grace
[58:39] right to write most of the New Testament
[58:41] he says you know that we do not have
[58:43] sufficiency not that we are sufficient
[58:45] of ourselves to think anything as of
[58:47] ourselves so basically we don't think we
[58:49] have it all together we don't think you
[58:51] know God's commissioned us that we can
[58:52] just walk on you know people can get in
[58:55] such a way when they become Christians
[58:56] they can become arrogant
[58:58] take a look I'm a believer I'm in I'm
[59:01] above everyone else I'm better than
[59:02] everyone else that's wrong we should
[59:04] never have that kind of an attitude and
[59:06] then people could get the Holy Ghost and
[59:08] they go you know chasing gifts and
[59:10] trying to trying to trying to work out
[59:12] their ministry that's wrong too God will
[59:14] lead you to it God will lead you to it
[59:16] it's not what you imagine for God to
[59:18] make you no God will make you something
[59:19] and it's normally the the complete
[59:21] opposite to think to what you think you
[59:23] should be
[59:24] praise God
[59:27] Hallelujah sufficiency means to be the
[59:29] ability or competency to do a thing
[59:32] so so the Apostle Paul is saying our
[59:35] sufficiency or our ability or competency
[59:38] to do do this thing is of the Lord
[59:41] amen I trust you have that same um
[59:43] testimony your sufficiency is of God
[59:47] amen where the next verse would say who
[59:49] has also made us able Ministers of the
[59:52] New Testament not of the letter above of
[59:53] the spirit for the letter killeth but
[59:55] the spirit giveth life
[59:57] Hallelujah now this was the Apostle Paul
[1:00:00] saying this this is not just
[1:00:02] um
[1:00:03] Joe Christian average
[1:00:05] you know this is the Apostle Paul he's
[1:00:07] the first church age messenger God gave
[1:00:10] him the abundance of you know you know
[1:00:11] incredible Revelations that that that we
[1:00:14] feed on now he was caught up into the
[1:00:15] third heaven many many incredible things
[1:00:17] happened to him but it's amazing because
[1:00:20] before before he went uh before he met
[1:00:24] God on the road to Damascus he would
[1:00:25] have said my sufficiency is of being a
[1:00:28] Pharisee of the Pharisees my ability or
[1:00:30] competency is in my wisdom my competency
[1:00:34] or my ability is because I studied hard
[1:00:37] because I have good intellect I can
[1:00:39] recall the scripture just like this and
[1:00:41] I know all the laws and I know how to do
[1:00:43] everything I I I I but when the Lord got
[1:00:46] him on the road to Damascus there he
[1:00:48] realized that his sufficiency was
[1:00:50] actually a man-made sufficiency by a
[1:00:52] man-made religion and it was a man-made
[1:00:54] high priest that commissioned him to do
[1:00:56] a man-made job right we don't want to
[1:00:58] have a man-made religion and a man-made
[1:01:01] sufficiency right and when he met the
[1:01:03] Lord he realized his own ability he says
[1:01:05] I counted all but done that I may win
[1:01:07] Christ see everything he thought he was
[1:01:09] he actually on a scale he said no what I
[1:01:11] think I am has actually done
[1:01:13] Hallelujah all the awards all the
[1:01:16] plaques all the all the Gunning
[1:01:18] ceremonies all the degrees he had
[1:01:20] he put it into one classification done
[1:01:25] why is that he had to do that because he
[1:01:27] realized actually you know my own human
[1:01:29] ability has actually been the biggest
[1:01:31] hindrance I've had in my life because
[1:01:33] his own human ability made him actually
[1:01:35] persecute the very God he thought he was
[1:01:37] serving
[1:01:38] and how can we get to a spot where we
[1:01:40] think well I know the message I know the
[1:01:42] quotes I know all these things
[1:01:44] and yet your own ability actually
[1:01:45] fighting the very God you think you're
[1:01:47] serving
[1:01:49] oh my Moses Moses had a lot of abilities
[1:01:53] we know that Moses was a Moses was going
[1:01:56] to be potentially the next pharaoh
[1:01:59] in Egypt
[1:02:01] Pharaohs were gods they weren't just
[1:02:03] even how we treat the royalty uh how yo
[1:02:06] yo people people talk about royalty
[1:02:08] nowadays you'd never have you know if
[1:02:10] there's Paparazzi in those days they
[1:02:11] would have been taken out
[1:02:13] they would have been taken because they
[1:02:14] had an image to uphold you know all the
[1:02:16] ugly bits of their lives they would
[1:02:18] never have been broadcast
[1:02:19] there would have been a lot of dead
[1:02:21] journalists and stuff right because they
[1:02:24] were they were considered gods and I I
[1:02:26] believe they believed they were deity
[1:02:27] and flesh so so Moses was was crafted
[1:02:31] and taught and schooled to embody the
[1:02:34] same persona
[1:02:36] so you think about how Moses the Bible
[1:02:37] says that well this is after he met the
[1:02:40] Lord on the road um in the burning bush
[1:02:42] says Moses was the meekest man in all
[1:02:44] the Earth
[1:02:45] he he wasn't born meek
[1:02:47] he wasn't Mighty Moses The Prince of
[1:02:50] Egypt ruler of you know conqueror of
[1:02:52] Ethiopia or whatever he did all the
[1:02:54] great military campaigns he led he
[1:02:56] wasn't the meekest man all the Earth in
[1:02:58] that moment how would you ever craft a
[1:03:00] prince to be a Meek man when you know
[1:03:03] it's strength it takes strength to
[1:03:06] conquer it takes strength to rule that's
[1:03:07] what they were taught you would never
[1:03:09] train him up in a way now Moses you see
[1:03:11] how you know Ramsay says all these
[1:03:13] things you're not meant to be the like
[1:03:15] that you're meant to be Moses the meek
[1:03:17] Prince of Egypt now he wouldn't he
[1:03:20] wasn't taught that way he was taught the
[1:03:21] opposite Moses you're a God and flesh
[1:03:23] you may be Pharaoh one day you're more
[1:03:26] than a man Moses you know any any and he
[1:03:29] taught you know he learned all the
[1:03:31] wisdom of the Egyptians very smart man
[1:03:34] so he had a lot of abilities but he had
[1:03:36] to lose every one of them to fulfill his
[1:03:38] part of the scripture he had to lose
[1:03:41] every one of them and it took 40 years
[1:03:43] on the right yo yo the back side of the
[1:03:44] desert with a high-tempered wife to get
[1:03:47] it out of him
[1:03:48] he was high tempered sapora was high
[1:03:50] tempered too you know when when when the
[1:03:52] angel came to kill him because he didn't
[1:03:53] circumcise his son or his sons and you
[1:03:56] know she said you're a bloody husband to
[1:03:57] me you know just just let a temper go
[1:04:00] why it was 40 Years of grinding
[1:04:03] God had to strip him that's amazing you
[1:04:05] know we think it's it's trolls everyone
[1:04:07] else and we just caught in the trial now
[1:04:09] actually a trials about us too and
[1:04:11] actually we can be the cause of the
[1:04:12] trial you know Moses maybe had a lot of
[1:04:14] hard Seasons you know lambing season was
[1:04:16] hard there's not much grass and trouble
[1:04:18] at home troubling trouble at work he had
[1:04:20] trouble ever in his life what was
[1:04:22] happening God was bringing him down to
[1:04:24] nothing that he could Elevate him to be
[1:04:26] there's not another Prophet like Moses
[1:04:28] Hallelujah I spoke looked to air too
[1:04:30] amen so he had to lose every one of
[1:04:33] those every one of those abilities or
[1:04:35] what he thought was abilities
[1:04:37] that God could get a hold of his life
[1:04:39] you think about him you know a pharaoh
[1:04:41] would have been a great orator
[1:04:43] he would have been very good he would
[1:04:44] have been confident everywhere he went
[1:04:46] he didn't get stage fright this is God
[1:04:48] and flesh we're talking about you know
[1:04:50] you know he wasn't just a he didn't get
[1:04:52] nervous but God stripped him down in
[1:04:55] such a way that when God made him he
[1:04:56] said I can't speak you know I'm slow of
[1:04:58] tongue no one's going to hear me you
[1:05:01] know I can't do the job
[1:05:04] but the first 40 Years of his life he
[1:05:06] thought I am ready and he killed that
[1:05:09] Egyptian because he was now fully
[1:05:11] trained and equipped to do the job in
[1:05:13] his own strength
[1:05:14] but he was trying to get strength out of
[1:05:16] strength to fulfill the word of God and
[1:05:19] he miserably failed so God had to bring
[1:05:21] him down to nothing
[1:05:23] God knows how to do a job God knows how
[1:05:25] to get us ready God knows how to prepare
[1:05:28] us God knows the time that we're going
[1:05:29] to meet him and he's very good at
[1:05:32] grinding us down
[1:05:34] I know there's not a Hallelujah kind of
[1:05:36] service
[1:05:37] but we need to re-look at our trials in
[1:05:40] our life
[1:05:41] because if we think we have the ability
[1:05:43] to go in a Rapture and to spread this
[1:05:46] word in our own strength nothing's going
[1:05:48] to happen
[1:05:49] but if we fully surrender our all our
[1:05:52] lives all the way our West love the Lord
[1:05:54] our hearts all mind and strength you
[1:05:56] know that God can work on us then God's
[1:05:59] ability comes in
[1:06:00] then we're no longer weak but we are
[1:06:02] strong because of his
[1:06:04] Amen brother Brahm says see
[1:06:07] uh see see no ability I don't care what
[1:06:09] it is it'll be never be able to be
[1:06:11] usable in the sight of God God has to
[1:06:13] get all of our abilities out of us
[1:06:15] before he can achieve his purpose if he
[1:06:17] has got something for us to do as long
[1:06:19] as we feel that we're doing a pretty
[1:06:20] good job out of it we'll then we'll
[1:06:22] never be able to be used of God
[1:06:26] amen see he had to lose all those
[1:06:29] abilities and God made him on the back
[1:06:30] side of the days of the burning bush
[1:06:32] transformed his life and one 80 year old
[1:06:35] man turned over the superpower of the
[1:06:36] age and took his people out Hallelujah
[1:06:39] why because he fully surrendered his
[1:06:42] abilities everything he was into the
[1:06:43] hands of God and he realized there's
[1:06:45] nothing all his abilities did was killed
[1:06:47] one Egyptian and he had to run for his
[1:06:49] life but God's ability in him just
[1:06:51] opened the Red Sea brought brought the
[1:06:54] plagues brought Deliverance did
[1:06:55] everything amen because it was God's
[1:06:57] ability in him amen see we've got to get
[1:07:00] away from that human ability we've got
[1:07:01] to get to a place where we can surrender
[1:07:03] our souls Our Lives even to the
[1:07:04] housewives to the farmer to the mechanic
[1:07:06] or whoever we are we've got to
[1:07:08] completely surrender to God and know
[1:07:10] that we are nothing then God then let
[1:07:12] God start from there then he starts
[1:07:14] moving working and that includes all of
[1:07:16] us everyone the thing that we've got to
[1:07:18] do Amen to get to a place where that we
[1:07:20] know we're nothing then he starts
[1:07:22] working from there
[1:07:24] they say that's not a good place to be
[1:07:26] that's the best place to be where you
[1:07:28] think you are the you are the epitome of
[1:07:30] the message of the hour
[1:07:32] God don't even you're over there
[1:07:34] somewhere but when you say Lord I Have
[1:07:36] Nothing
[1:07:37] take the surrendered vessel Lord Use Me
[1:07:39] For Your Glory then God can start
[1:07:41] working I mean just a complete total
[1:07:43] surrender of your weakness under God say
[1:07:45] Here I Am have nothing no ability that
[1:07:47] you can trust in
[1:07:49] Hallelujah the Apostle Paul What a
[1:07:51] Mighty as I said what a what a mighty
[1:07:53] What a Mighty Warrior Fighter for the
[1:07:56] gospel his life was incredible
[1:08:00] what he went through
[1:08:01] but he never got to a place where he
[1:08:04] thought well I have it all together
[1:08:06] but he let his human weakness
[1:08:09] he glorified the Bible says in his
[1:08:11] infirmities
[1:08:12] so he didn't make an idol out of them
[1:08:14] but he realized Lord the reason I am
[1:08:17] weak is so your strength can be
[1:08:18] manifested
[1:08:19] because many times we well the world
[1:08:22] teaches us in order to be successful we
[1:08:24] have to have it all together we have to
[1:08:26] be smart we have to be strong we're to
[1:08:28] be beautiful we're to be handsome we've
[1:08:29] got to be be able to uh you know
[1:08:31] articulate our words and speak well and
[1:08:33] do everything well no but that's the
[1:08:35] opposite to what God wants God wants the
[1:08:36] ones God wants people that people will
[1:08:38] never consider God wants the unlikelies
[1:08:41] he wants the outcasts he wants to down
[1:08:43] and outs those are the people God uses
[1:08:45] out of that weaknesses strength is
[1:08:46] manifested Hallelujah
[1:08:50] praise the Lord amen so
[1:08:52] he says oh I belong to the biggest
[1:08:54] church here in the country
[1:08:56] you know I'm this Lord oh I'm
[1:08:58] Pentecostal I say oh I'm in the message
[1:08:59] glory to God I just received the Holy
[1:09:01] Ghost the other night Hallelujah you're
[1:09:03] going to make me do so and so God can't
[1:09:05] use that a bit of that
[1:09:07] whenever you get looked and realized
[1:09:09] you're looked and then come back and
[1:09:11] humble yourself get weak find out you're
[1:09:13] human and there's none of your
[1:09:14] intellectuals can do it human weakness
[1:09:16] will never be used of God God by the
[1:09:19] human weaknesses pours himself into you
[1:09:21] then he uses himself
[1:09:24] praise God when we because you know how
[1:09:26] you know
[1:09:27] the the person that upsets us the most
[1:09:30] is the person in the mirror
[1:09:33] and that's when you're standing in front
[1:09:35] of their mirror Alone by the way not
[1:09:36] when you've got your spouse or someone
[1:09:37] next to you it's you alone looking in
[1:09:39] the mirror just in case some of you
[1:09:40] thought well it's her it's him no no my
[1:09:42] you know my brother my sister said no no
[1:09:44] no no it's you when you're having a
[1:09:46] one-on-one teeth brushing session by
[1:09:48] yourself it's that person and and we get
[1:09:51] so annoyed at our own our own
[1:09:53] personality our own Humanity but let God
[1:09:56] use that weakness that you feel and he
[1:09:58] pours himself into you and then he uses
[1:10:01] himself in you and you just become an
[1:10:03] instrument certainly you've got to get
[1:10:05] yourself out of the way Moses oh he
[1:10:07] learned he learned human weakness real
[1:10:08] good he learned it so well to when God
[1:10:10] called him he had seven weaknesses that
[1:10:12] he could argue against God's call did
[1:10:14] you ever study that in the first part of
[1:10:16] Exodus the seven weaknesses he says I
[1:10:18] got them roped down here I want you to
[1:10:19] listen to the first weakness he had was
[1:10:20] a lack of a message the second week
[1:10:22] weaknesses he had was a lack of
[1:10:24] authority the third witness he had was a
[1:10:26] lack of eloquence the fourth was
[1:10:29] um adoption uh the fifth was success the
[1:10:31] sixth was one uh one was exception you
[1:10:34] know being accepted now you compare
[1:10:36] yours with his and see if you can come
[1:10:38] up with that see if you can get as weak
[1:10:40] as he was Lord I ain't no good I can't
[1:10:42] speak I slew an Egyptian I can't go back
[1:10:44] out everything they won't receive leave
[1:10:45] me I have no message I can't speak I'm
[1:10:47] slow in speech see how he was he was
[1:10:49] nothing brother he'd been cured
[1:10:52] he'd been cured Hallelujah he'd been
[1:10:54] cured of being oh I'm a God in Egypt he
[1:10:56] got cured of that when he came down to
[1:10:58] that spot saying lord I can't do
[1:11:00] anything you've asked me to do
[1:11:02] he was cured Hallelujah do you think he
[1:11:04] is feeling happy no but he was cured
[1:11:08] amen see people always want to feel good
[1:11:11] but if we feel good about ourselves and
[1:11:13] well I can do it look at me and look at
[1:11:14] my successes look at all these things
[1:11:15] God can't use that
[1:11:17] now I don't mean you have to feel bad
[1:11:19] about yourself but you've got to realize
[1:11:21] your sufficiency is of God
[1:11:23] hope that came out right amen see he had
[1:11:26] been cured see God can use him after he
[1:11:28] was cured see yeah
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:31] Hallelujah you see you
[1:11:34] praise the Lord see see
[1:11:36] um
[1:11:39] he says here there's just a few a few um
[1:11:41] points oh to a man or woman that's weak
[1:11:44] enough that realizes your weakness then
[1:11:46] let God use you
[1:11:48] he says now the Apostle Paul say he was
[1:11:52] such a mighty man of his of his day
[1:11:55] and he was a warrior that stripped
[1:11:58] himself as of of all his abilities he
[1:12:00] thought he had and he says if there's
[1:12:02] anything that our schools need today if
[1:12:03] there's anything our churches needs
[1:12:05] today is the stripping of themselves of
[1:12:06] their own thoughts and their own
[1:12:08] abilities strip yourself before God
[1:12:09] unless you could try to do something
[1:12:12] within yourself see we can't do anything
[1:12:14] within ourselves
[1:12:16] why are you saying these things before a
[1:12:18] prayer service because God is the god
[1:12:19] who answers prayer but if we approach
[1:12:22] them like we have an ability and God has
[1:12:24] to listen to you because of who you are
[1:12:25] that's not a humble approach see he
[1:12:28] resists the proud and gives grace to the
[1:12:30] humble amen and why do we pray to God
[1:12:32] God ultimately as God change my mind to
[1:12:35] match your mind my Father in heaven
[1:12:37] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:12:39] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:12:42] heaven which earth oh many times talk
[1:12:44] about countries Nations politics
[1:12:46] economics whatever more no it's this
[1:12:48] Earth
[1:12:50] the will needs to be done in first
[1:12:53] Hallelujah and they said how do you
[1:12:55] within within in prayer what does that
[1:12:58] Lord change my mind and my heart to
[1:12:59] match yours Lord You're not I have a lot
[1:13:02] of needs and you said come to me with my
[1:13:04] needs so so I'm coming Lord I have this
[1:13:05] big list but Lord you're not an errand
[1:13:07] boy to me you're not some servant you're
[1:13:09] not some PA I call up and say now listen
[1:13:11] Mr Jesus you know I want this by this
[1:13:14] time amen we love you
[1:13:17] that's not how it works that is the
[1:13:19] wrong approach
[1:13:21] well Lord you better listen to me I'm
[1:13:22] the bride of Christ I'm your wife you
[1:13:24] better toe the line and this is what I
[1:13:26] need and right now no Lord your king see
[1:13:30] many people want him as a savior but
[1:13:31] they don't want him as Lord
[1:13:33] he is our Lord and savior you've got to
[1:13:35] have him as both
[1:13:36] amen he's our King right he can do what
[1:13:39] he wants
[1:13:41] so we need to come in a real no I'm not
[1:13:44] saying you're not humble right but you
[1:13:46] know we've got to get this idea out of
[1:13:48] our heads about our own human ability
[1:13:49] maybe I've just been thinking about
[1:13:51] myself a bit you know welcome for me
[1:13:53] just speaking my thoughts about me to
[1:13:55] you right but you know we've got to
[1:13:57] realize that that we when we realize
[1:13:59] we're weak then we can be strong
[1:14:01] now wait let's just um I think I'm
[1:14:04] running out of
[1:14:05] what I got here now if we go to the
[1:14:08] scripture
[1:14:10] and we go to Second Corinthians
[1:14:13] well let's go to First Corinthians two
[1:14:15] and one first okay see this is the kind
[1:14:17] of man the Apostle Paul became
[1:14:20] Hallelujah
[1:14:22] you know he is the model of every true
[1:14:23] minister
[1:14:25] right
[1:14:26] he had a word
[1:14:28] he preached the word of the day
[1:14:30] he had a he had a god anointed Ministry
[1:14:33] right he didn't deviate from the truth
[1:14:37] amen he was a god called God sent
[1:14:40] minister
[1:14:41] and every true Minister patents after
[1:14:43] the Apostle Paul
[1:14:46] he says and Brethren when I came to you
[1:14:48] came not with Excellency of speech nor
[1:14:50] of wisdom declaring unto you the
[1:14:52] testimony of God for I determined not to
[1:14:54] know anything among you saved Jesus
[1:14:56] Christ and him crucified and I was with
[1:14:59] you in in what strength and eloquence
[1:15:02] inability and and and Persona and
[1:15:05] Charisma no I was with you in weakness
[1:15:08] and in fear and much trembling and my
[1:15:12] speech my preaching was not with
[1:15:13] enticing words of man wisdom but the
[1:15:16] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:15:18] that your face should not stand in the
[1:15:20] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[1:15:23] so this is how he was he wasn't a
[1:15:25] Hollywood Showman he came in fear and
[1:15:28] weakness and a much trembling
[1:15:30] because he was Desiring above everything
[1:15:32] that their faith would not stand in his
[1:15:35] wisdom but it would stand in the power
[1:15:37] of God that when the Apostle Paul left
[1:15:39] they weren't following the Apostle Paul
[1:15:42] right they were caught up in Jesus
[1:15:44] Christ they met him so he would say that
[1:15:46] the Apostle Paul would would go into a
[1:15:48] place and make one convert come back a
[1:15:50] few weeks later and there'd be 30
[1:15:52] converts from that one
[1:15:53] why because the people's confidence was
[1:15:55] in the power of God
[1:15:57] praise the Lord second Corinthians 3 and
[1:15:59] and three to six for as much as you oh
[1:16:02] no sorry I read that one second
[1:16:03] Corinthians 12 and 6. for though I
[1:16:05] desire to Glory I shall not be a fool
[1:16:08] for I will say the truth but now I
[1:16:10] forbear at least any man should think of
[1:16:12] me above that which he seeth me to be or
[1:16:15] that heareth of me and this I should be
[1:16:17] exalted above measure through the
[1:16:19] abundance of the revelations it was
[1:16:21] given to me a thorn in the flesh now we
[1:16:23] didn't read it but before this he speaks
[1:16:24] about a man being taken up to the third
[1:16:26] heaven that was himself but the heaven
[1:16:29] of heavens
[1:16:31] he was he was taken beyond the curtain
[1:16:32] of time if we put it into message
[1:16:34] language right so so he talks about this
[1:16:37] and he comes down into this line of
[1:16:38] thought here at least I should be
[1:16:40] exalted about the measure through the
[1:16:41] abundance of the revelations that were
[1:16:43] given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[1:16:45] messenger of Satan to buffer me lest I
[1:16:46] shall be exalted above measure for this
[1:16:48] thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it
[1:16:50] might depart from me and he said it he
[1:16:52] said unto me my grace is sufficient for
[1:16:54] thee for my strength is made perfect in
[1:16:57] weakness
[1:16:58] most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:17:00] glory in my infirmities that the power
[1:17:03] of Christ May rest upon me therefore I
[1:17:06] take pleasure in infirmities and
[1:17:07] reproaches and necessities and
[1:17:09] persecutions and distresses for Christ's
[1:17:12] sake for when I am weak then am I strong
[1:17:15] Hallelujah sorry sorry says now he says
[1:17:18] so my strength so he had the sword on
[1:17:20] the flesh and because he's thinking
[1:17:23] maybe within himself if I just get rid
[1:17:24] of this thing I can be a better
[1:17:26] Christian
[1:17:26] if I could this thing that buffets me if
[1:17:29] I can just get rid of it then I can have
[1:17:31] a closer walk with God I can really
[1:17:33] overcome I can really be successful if I
[1:17:36] get rid of these things but then the
[1:17:38] Lord said no my grace is sufficient for
[1:17:41] thee for my strength is made perfect in
[1:17:43] weakness so he began to Rejoice because
[1:17:46] he realized actually this thing is in my
[1:17:49] life for my good
[1:17:50] Hallelujah and this thing is not
[1:17:52] actually here to hinder my Christian
[1:17:54] walk it's here to actually drive me more
[1:17:56] towards God so how was your problems in
[1:17:59] your life what does it do because many
[1:18:01] times you think well if I didn't have
[1:18:03] this person in my life and if this
[1:18:04] wasn't going on at work and if I didn't
[1:18:06] have this bank account trouble and then
[1:18:07] if this wasn't going on then I'd rarely
[1:18:09] be a Christian
[1:18:11] no
[1:18:12] that wasn't the Apostle Paul thought
[1:18:15] after the Lord met him he just praised
[1:18:17] God
[1:18:18] Hallelujah he just he realized no I'm
[1:18:20] just going to glory in my infirmities
[1:18:23] amen amen because why the Lord's
[1:18:25] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:18:27] now some people think this Thorn In the
[1:18:30] Flesh was some besetting sin it wasn't a
[1:18:32] besetting sin some people think well
[1:18:34] I've got this lust problem this
[1:18:35] pornographic problem I just can't
[1:18:36] overcome it but it's a thought in the
[1:18:38] flesh to keep me humble no that's
[1:18:39] unbelief speaking
[1:18:42] that's ridiculous
[1:18:44] no that is just actually people being a
[1:18:47] human shield for a devil because they
[1:18:48] enjoy it
[1:18:50] so it was not some
[1:18:52] unclean I mean you know it wasn't a
[1:18:54] besetting sin in his life that the soul
[1:18:56] of the flesh was we know that amen but
[1:18:58] he realized that the Lord's strength is
[1:19:01] made perfect in weakness
[1:19:02] so I find you know in life when things
[1:19:05] are really actually stressful you know
[1:19:07] there's great problems is actually when
[1:19:09] God can come on the scene in a far
[1:19:10] greater way then everything's fine
[1:19:13] and I believe that's how the Apostle
[1:19:14] Paul found it
[1:19:16] that he glories in his infirmities well
[1:19:17] he didn't complain about the trouble he
[1:19:19] had he just praised God anyhow why that
[1:19:22] the power of Christ May rest upon him
[1:19:25] Hallelujah
[1:19:27] amen as long as we are trying in
[1:19:30] ourselves and and depending on our own
[1:19:31] abilities and so forth well we'll do
[1:19:33] nothing and when we get to a place where
[1:19:35] we know we're nothing then God can use
[1:19:37] us
[1:19:38] Hallelujah well I'm just going to finish
[1:19:39] sorry this is I'm going to um
[1:19:42] see I'm just going to finish with this
[1:19:44] thought here there's there's on the
[1:19:46] Apostle Paul that's from when we read um
[1:19:48] First Corinthians uh two right he says I
[1:19:52] was with you in greatness and what
[1:19:53] weakness and fear are much trembling can
[1:19:54] you imagine a man a Pharisee of the
[1:19:56] Pharisees a teacher of the teachers a
[1:19:57] man that was trained from childhood for
[1:19:59] the ministry to be an eloquent man that
[1:20:01] was smart brilliant and come before a
[1:20:03] class of people like the Corinthians and
[1:20:05] say I was with you in meekness and in
[1:20:07] fear and much trembling a man who turned
[1:20:09] the world upside down the greatest
[1:20:10] missionary that was ever known confessed
[1:20:12] that he came in weakness not as a
[1:20:14] trained scholar but in the weakness and
[1:20:16] fear at least he would step off the path
[1:20:18] somewhere see he didn't want to let
[1:20:20] popularity a woman or money or anything
[1:20:22] of the world make him step off the path
[1:20:24] of Walking with God that's why he was in
[1:20:26] fear and much trembling right that the
[1:20:28] he's afraid that people would Elevate
[1:20:30] him above who he really was
[1:20:32] because he could not trust in his own
[1:20:34] ability the reason he was fearing not
[1:20:37] because he was scared of anything but he
[1:20:39] was scared he would displease God in
[1:20:41] some way that he would get his own
[1:20:43] ability mixed up into it
[1:20:45] something that he had learned that he
[1:20:47] had he was telling them that I didn't
[1:20:49] come to you with this Excellency of
[1:20:50] speech I come to you in fear that I
[1:20:52] would come that way but I come to you
[1:20:55] knowing nothing but Christ and him
[1:20:56] crucified and I come to you in fear and
[1:20:58] weakness most trembling in my speech and
[1:21:00] my preaching was not with enticing words
[1:21:01] of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of
[1:21:04] the spirit and power listen to this man
[1:21:06] who was a warrior had stripped himself
[1:21:08] amen if there's anything that our
[1:21:10] schools need today anything our churches
[1:21:11] need today is the stripping of ourselves
[1:21:13] of our own thoughts and of our own
[1:21:14] abilities strip yourself before God
[1:21:17] unless you try to do something within
[1:21:19] yourselves
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:23] so friends out of weakness comes
[1:21:27] strength
[1:21:28] perfect strength isn't perfect weakness
[1:21:30] many times we think man I need to get
[1:21:33] perfectly strong that I'll get perfect
[1:21:34] and then I have perfect strength no if
[1:21:37] you have perfect weakness then you have
[1:21:39] perfect strength why because out of
[1:21:41] weakness comes his strength
[1:21:45] life's not so bad after all is it
[1:21:48] the Lord allows us to be in a way where
[1:21:50] we depend upon him that his strength can
[1:21:52] come into our lives and he can manifest
[1:21:54] his word
[1:21:55] and when you look back and see what
[1:21:56] everything he did would you want to
[1:21:58] trade that
[1:21:59] for I'm the big shot and look how great
[1:22:01] I am and me me me and no power of God
[1:22:04] living
[1:22:05] I'd rather have the Lord live but the
[1:22:07] Apostle Paul he gloried in his
[1:22:08] affirmities his Necessities all the
[1:22:10] trouble he had and God lived in his life
[1:22:13] who wants to be that kind of a person
[1:22:15] Hallelujah
[1:22:17] amen let's um
[1:22:21] so we're gonna have a time of prayer now
[1:22:24] we have a few prayer requests
[1:22:27] so we're going to I was going to read
[1:22:28] these out and if anyone else has any
[1:22:30] more and then we'll sing a song

[1:23:00] and is recovering but with all this some
[1:23:02] Logistics might have to change so that
