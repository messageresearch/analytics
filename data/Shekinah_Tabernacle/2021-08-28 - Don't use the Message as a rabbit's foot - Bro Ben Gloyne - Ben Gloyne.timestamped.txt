[47:57] yep
[47:59] brilliant so let's go to judges 17.
[48:05] um
[48:08] judges 17 and verse 1
[48:10] uh so christie and i were talking about
[48:12] this during the week and it's amazing
[48:14] when you look into
[48:16] uh the book of judges or i mean the
[48:18] scripture we know i've got the scripture
[48:21] later but we know all scriptures for
[48:22] doctrine for a proof
[48:24] uh that the you know for correction that
[48:26] the matter of exhortation that the man
[48:28] of god can be fully furnished so
[48:30] um all scriptures are inspired for this
[48:32] so even if we we're gonna go through
[48:34] this chapter here
[48:36] and um
[48:38] it's really every scripture is
[48:39] applicable for us in this end time
[48:42] let's just read here uh if you'd like a
[48:45] title for this this may sound a bit out
[48:47] of left field somewhere but
[48:49] i'd like to call this don't use the
[48:51] message as a like a rabbit's foot
[48:54] so don't use the message like a lucky
[48:56] rabbit's foot
[48:57] so
[48:58] judges 17 and one if i'm there
[49:01] yeah
[49:02] no judges 17 and 1. and there was a man
[49:05] of of mount ephraim whose name was micah
[49:09] and he said to his mother
[49:10] the
[49:12] 1100 shekels of silva that were taken
[49:14] from thee about which thou curseth and
[49:18] spaketh of also in mine is behold the
[49:20] silver is with me i took it and his
[49:22] mother said blessed be thou of the lord
[49:24] my son and when he had restored the
[49:26] eleven hundred shekels of silva to his
[49:28] mother his mother said i am wholly
[49:30] dedicated the silver unto the lord from
[49:32] my hand for my son to make a graven
[49:35] image and a molten image now therefore i
[49:38] will restore it
[49:39] unto thee
[49:41] yet he restored the money unto his
[49:43] mother
[49:44] and his mother took 200 shekels of
[49:46] silver and gave them to the founder who
[49:48] made thereof a graven image and a molten
[49:51] image and they were in the house of
[49:52] micah and the man micah had had an house
[49:55] of gods and made an ephod and a
[49:58] terraphin
[49:59] and consecrated one of his sons to
[50:00] become his priest in those days there
[50:02] was no king in israel but every man did
[50:05] that which was right in his own eyes
[50:08] i mean if you want to keep that chapter
[50:10] handy they'll be they'll be real good
[50:11] malicious bowheads in a word of prayer
[50:13] this morning may seem like an unusual
[50:15] reading but i believe the lord has
[50:16] something in here very personal for all
[50:19] of us so this is bow heads in a word of
[50:21] prayer if you want to be remembered and
[50:22] praised want to lift your hand before
[50:23] the lord
[50:24] i mean god bless you the lord sees every
[50:26] raised hand let's pray gracious heavenly
[50:28] father thank you once again that we can
[50:30] gather lord even though we are separated
[50:33] by distance we want to thank you that we
[50:34] could use this technology dear lord that
[50:36] we can gather as a people father we can

[51:15] lord in your presence we thank you so
[51:16] much lord we can gather in jesus
[51:18] christ's name amen
[51:20] amen god bless you friends you may have
[51:22] your seats uh this morning so the book
[51:25] of judges we know is a
[51:27] is an account of really a a cycle of
[51:30] revival and death where the first
[51:32] generation comes into the land and then
[51:34] they
[51:35] and then they uh you know take take
[51:37] their portion of the land but then the
[51:39] next generation comes in and then what
[51:41] happens is they fall into idolatry you
[51:43] know they begin to backslide then an
[51:45] enemy comes in and oppresses them then
[51:47] then they call out to god and then god
[51:49] seems to deliver it and the deliverer
[51:51] delivers them and now they're living in
[51:53] freedom but it's not very long after
[51:54] that then another enemy comes in because
[51:56] of the people's backsliding and
[51:58] worshiping other gods and you know and
[52:00] then and then the enemy oppresses them
[52:02] then they call out for deliverance again
[52:04] and then god sends another deliverer and
[52:06] then god delivers them then the people
[52:08] walk in liberty again only to fall into
[52:10] idolatry again now we know that we are
[52:13] living in a day where
[52:15] it's the end of these cycles
[52:17] but
[52:18] the thing is just because a dispensation
[52:20] is coming into fulfillment it does mean
[52:22] everyone is walking according to that
[52:24] dispensation now we read here in uh
[52:27] verse six
[52:28] in those days there was no king in
[52:30] israel but every man did that which was
[52:31] right in his own eyes now some people
[52:33] say but we have a king the lord jesus
[52:36] christ we're living in a different era
[52:37] but that may be true to the bride but
[52:39] how about you personally is he your king
[52:42] or are you doing that which is right in
[52:43] your own eyes because we know that
[52:45] everyone believes they are right you
[52:47] know everyone believes they're on the
[52:48] right track they're doing the right
[52:50] thing but it's god really should be our
[52:53] measuring stick or our mirror that we
[52:55] should look into the word of god and we
[52:57] should see is our lives telling up with
[53:00] the scripture now we're not talking
[53:01] about our lives telling up for the
[53:03] scripture i'm not talking about a mental
[53:04] acknowledgement of doctrine i'm not
[53:06] talking about dressing right only or or
[53:08] you know doing those things or i'm
[53:10] talking about a life that's lived is the
[53:12] life of christ manifested in your life
[53:14] because we know that this message has
[53:16] come i mean not just to restore bible
[53:18] truth but that god would live in a
[53:19] people once again brother brahm says
[53:21] that the holy ghost that was bound at
[53:23] the doors of creeds and dogmas has been
[53:25] released in the end time by the message
[53:27] of the hour because of being restored
[53:29] back to a true word of god now to me
[53:31] this is astounding where
[53:33] if you just take this picture here now
[53:35] here's believers they're living in the
[53:37] promised land
[53:39] they they they are living in their
[53:40] inheritance but yet there's a family
[53:43] here and this is really not just this
[53:45] family but you could say this is a
[53:47] condition of the people where where they
[53:49] have gone such to a lukewarm condition
[53:51] that here is a people who think they are
[53:54] doing the lord a service they think they
[53:56] are serving god and god would be pleased
[53:58] with them but yet they have idols in
[54:00] their home they would take something
[54:02] that was cursed and now they make that
[54:04] you know this is read here let's just
[54:06] read verse three i just want you to keep
[54:08] your focus if you could today and when
[54:10] he had restored the 1100 shekels of
[54:12] silver to his mother his mother said i
[54:14] had wholly dedicated the ser um the
[54:16] silver unto the lord
[54:18] from the uh from my hand for my um from
[54:22] my hand for my son now if you just take
[54:24] that you think if she is wholly
[54:25] dedicated up she had a clear mind if she
[54:28] really had the mind of christ if i put
[54:30] it that way if she dedicated the
[54:32] syllable to the lord why on earth would
[54:34] she go and make idols out of it
[54:36] you see but because because she was a
[54:38] jew because she considered herself a
[54:39] believer she believed everything she did
[54:42] that has a religious connotation god
[54:44] will bless but that's not how god works
[54:46] god we have to live according to god's
[54:48] program we have to live according to his
[54:50] word we can't just take our own ideas
[54:52] and agree and say well you know it's
[54:54] good enough because i'm doing it you
[54:56] know and god must be pleased because i'm
[54:57] a believer we can't tread on that kind
[54:59] of ground we need to take god at his
[55:02] word i mean because god doesn't change
[55:04] his ways he's not he he he is no
[55:06] respecter of persons even the bible says
[55:08] to have to be irrespective of person is
[55:10] sin i mean so god's not going to be a
[55:12] respecter of person he's not going to
[55:14] exempt us from anything
[55:16] he's going to hold us to account
[55:18] now this may seem a rather heavy kind of
[55:20] message but you know the spirit of god
[55:22] is here for us to invite into our lives
[55:25] i mean that he can fulfill his word
[55:27] through us right so god doesn't put
[55:29] anything upon us that we cannot do
[55:31] because he has enabled us by his holy
[55:33] ghost to fulfill his word as if i'm with
[55:35] me so far so god is the enabler for us
[55:38] to be christians we can't be christians
[55:40] in our own strength we will just have a
[55:42] religious kind of a mess amen but if god
[55:44] comes and lives in our lives amen then
[55:47] he will manifest his word and that's
[55:48] what we amen are here to do
[55:52] praise the lord is everyone following me
[55:53] so far so you see even even this
[55:56] household that this man is in his mother
[55:58] has this warped idea that she can take
[56:01] silver and say i've dedicated to the
[56:02] lord but then make idols out of it
[56:04] so you know and and this may seem a bit
[56:06] kind of abstract but it's going to come
[56:08] right down on home okay so i'm i'm going
[56:11] somewhere just walk with me
[56:13] and um you see this is the thinking now
[56:18] here was this man
[56:21] micah
[56:22] and he had a house of god so he's a
[56:23] believer and he's got a house of gods
[56:26] and he had an ephod a terrific and he
[56:28] consecrated one of his sons who became
[56:30] his priest
[56:31] so in those days the priests were the
[56:34] levites this man wasn't a levite why on
[56:37] earth is he going outside of god's
[56:39] pattern to just make one of his sons a
[56:41] priest in his house you know why would
[56:43] you take the word and why would you walk
[56:45] it in such a way just to fit your own
[56:47] idea and unfortunately this is what many
[56:48] message people do they say well i
[56:50] believe all the mysteries i know the
[56:52] seven mystery mysterious everythings you
[56:54] know i know all the doctrine but if the
[56:56] life of god is not there that's just
[56:58] head knowledge that's an intellectual
[56:59] faith that doesn't do any good this
[57:01] message has come to change our character
[57:04] that will be conformed to his character
[57:06] amen that his life so he was full of
[57:07] mercy and grace sure but he you know you
[57:10] take the lord jesus he does not when god
[57:12] fully comes in all complexes pains and
[57:15] hurts amen demon spirits things are
[57:18] passed down through the family they go
[57:21] you walk a life of victory right you
[57:24] take the land you don't just say i
[57:26] believe the message and sit there and
[57:27] you're still sitting with the same old
[57:28] devil the same old problems i mean and
[57:31] you just remove yourself from them and
[57:32] think well i'll be fine no that's just
[57:34] removing yourself from the problem you
[57:36] know to overcome temptation is not just
[57:40] to remove yourself from it
[57:43] amen
[57:44] that's not actually overcoming because
[57:45] it doesn't change what's in here right
[57:47] to in order to overcome this must be
[57:49] changed and then when the temptation
[57:51] comes along if this has changed there's
[57:53] nothing in here that will want that
[57:54] temptation
[57:55] i mean it's very important amen that we
[57:58] let god cleanse us out i mean i don't
[58:00] want to be a house full of idols right
[58:02] we're a house aren't we i mean so lord
[58:04] take the take i think brother graham
[58:06] says take the bulldozer i mean of your
[58:08] word and go down our tin can alley and
[58:10] just bulldoze it away
[58:12] because remember this thing really this
[58:14] here look
[58:16] i've got this picture on the wall oh
[58:18] christian
[58:19] i'm dressing the part but this this
[58:21] could just be a veneer
[58:23] what about when you go beyond this
[58:27] what's on the inside because it's really
[58:29] what's on the inside matters and what's
[58:31] on the inside will manifest on the
[58:32] outside but many you know i just put it
[58:35] this way you can take a pig and paint up
[58:37] a pig it's still a pig on the inside but
[58:38] if you change the pig nature to a lamb
[58:40] nature that pig won't do what pigs used
[58:42] to do because the nature's changed it's
[58:44] the same thing with you and i we can't
[58:45] be painted like a painted up pig
[58:49] right we want to be lambs hallelujah and
[58:51] i believe by a center predestination we
[58:53] are lambs on the inside
[58:55] hallelujah and god can change us amen
[58:57] that what's really on the inside will
[58:59] come out
[59:00] praise the lord
[59:02] this this man he had a house of gods he
[59:05] consecrated one of his sons to be a
[59:06] priest it says in those days there was
[59:08] no king of the king in israel but every
[59:10] man did that which was right in his own
[59:12] eyes now our king is meant to be the
[59:15] word of god the lord jesus christ not
[59:17] our own religious ideas not our
[59:19] reasoning you know the problem is
[59:22] is if you have so much truth you can
[59:24] reason things away with that truth
[59:27] amen when i came to the lord i was a
[59:29] dirty rotten stinking sinner from the
[59:31] world i had no leg to stand on i had no
[59:34] religious you know this you know shield
[59:36] that i could put up and say well you
[59:38] know i'm this or that no but the problem
[59:40] is
[59:40] if people are just raised up
[59:42] in church they can have a shield and say
[59:45] well i'm a good person i never did what
[59:46] other people did i stayed right here you
[59:48] know the danger of that is people can
[59:50] actually just be raised up in the
[59:52] message without a birth and they can
[59:53] just begin to become just nominal
[59:55] christians just going to church because
[59:57] it becomes a habit
[59:59] we don't want to be that way friends
[1:00:01] this message didn't come for us just to
[1:00:02] become nominal christians just go to
[1:00:04] church and just because this is what we
[1:00:06] do this is not what we do because what
[1:00:08] we do this is what we do because we love
[1:00:10] the lord and he's met us and transformed
[1:00:12] our lives and made us new creatures amen
[1:00:14] he's changed
[1:00:15] he's changed us amen he's really changed
[1:00:18] us that the old man's dead amen and his
[1:00:20] deeds are dead and his deeds do not get
[1:00:22] resurrected they do not come back i mean
[1:00:24] they have been killed by the blood of
[1:00:26] jesus christ hallelujah this is how we
[1:00:28] should be right because this is what
[1:00:29] this message came to do it didn't come
[1:00:31] to make us message people i mean
[1:00:33] there'll be a lot of message people will
[1:00:34] be stuck here when the rapture happens
[1:00:36] but this is not why we're here to be
[1:00:38] message people we are christians amen
[1:00:40] that believe this message is the lord
[1:00:42] jesus christ which is to prepare a bride
[1:00:44] to take us off the earth this is the
[1:00:46] reason you think about okay i think i'm
[1:00:47] getting ahead of myself but let's just
[1:00:49] go down to the next one so all scripture
[1:00:51] is given by inspiration of god is
[1:00:53] profitable for doctrine for reproof for
[1:00:55] correction for instruction and
[1:00:56] righteousness that the man of god may be
[1:00:58] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[1:01:00] good works so i'm so some people don't
[1:01:03] like the old testament being preached
[1:01:04] from well i just say all scripture is
[1:01:06] given right it's an unbelieving spirit
[1:01:08] which will say the old testament doesn't
[1:01:09] apply today in some form i mean so you
[1:01:12] can't it's all inspired of god amen
[1:01:15] and it applies to you right now
[1:01:18] every man is right in his own eyes but
[1:01:19] the lord pondereth the hearts that man
[1:01:21] micah thought he was right amen he was
[1:01:24] right in his own eyes he was a believer
[1:01:26] he was a i'm a believer in the promised
[1:01:28] land amen hallelujah look how even you
[1:01:31] know look at all this religious stuff
[1:01:32] i've got i've even got my son's a priest
[1:01:34] come on you know he's consecrated he's
[1:01:36] been separated to this job you know he's
[1:01:38] not just some fly-by-night kind of guy
[1:01:39] he's a consecrated priest but he wasn't
[1:01:41] a levite it was just taking religious
[1:01:44] ideas and applying it to his life but
[1:01:46] not changing his life to match the word
[1:01:48] that's what brother ham says that we
[1:01:50] want our experiment experience to match
[1:01:52] god's bible right we don't want our
[1:01:54] experience to match anything but god's
[1:01:56] bible amen that's what we've got to have
[1:01:59] amen
[1:02:01] in those days
[1:02:02] there was no king in israel but every
[1:02:04] man did that which was right in his own
[1:02:06] eyes now brother ramsay is now a man can
[1:02:08] have an intellectual faith and there is
[1:02:11] that is where most people get today
[1:02:12] calling themselves christians the reason
[1:02:15] you see such carrying on as you do under
[1:02:18] the name of christianity it's only
[1:02:20] intellectual faith so it's only up here
[1:02:22] i mean it can sound good it can sound
[1:02:24] reasonable it can make sense but if it
[1:02:26] doesn't come down here and transform the
[1:02:29] life it's only an intellectual faith
[1:02:32] friends we're not called to have an
[1:02:33] intellectual faith amen we're called to
[1:02:35] go on a sphere above that amen we're all
[1:02:37] things apostle with a revelation faith
[1:02:39] amen that doesn't only bring the
[1:02:41] promises of god to pass it changes our
[1:02:43] nature to match this character of jesus
[1:02:46] christ amen
[1:02:49] notice this and the man micah had a
[1:02:50] house of gods and made an ephod and
[1:02:52] tariff him and consecrated one of his
[1:02:54] sons who became a priest in those days
[1:02:56] there's no king in israel but every man
[1:02:58] did that which was right in his own eyes
[1:03:00] now an ephod is a girdle now this is
[1:03:02] just from the strong's concordance if
[1:03:03] you're wondering where i got this
[1:03:05] so it's a girdle especially an e-fighter
[1:03:07] or a high-priest shoulder piece or also
[1:03:10] generally an image so an ephod is
[1:03:12] something a priest would wear so there's
[1:03:13] nothing wrong with that right but it's
[1:03:15] also it can be an image
[1:03:17] amen but then this terrapin i thought
[1:03:19] was very interesting amen it means a
[1:03:21] healer
[1:03:22] it also means a family idol
[1:03:26] right idolatry immatures a terrorism so
[1:03:28] now here what this man is doing is he's
[1:03:31] consecrated one of his sons
[1:03:33] to minister
[1:03:35] with a family idol now when i talk about
[1:03:38] idols i'm going to talk about spirits
[1:03:40] i'm going to talk about complexes i'm
[1:03:42] not talking about a something that's
[1:03:44] been fashioned out of silver gold you
[1:03:46] know stone wood you know that's on a
[1:03:48] mental piece somewhere i'm not talking
[1:03:50] about that i'm talking about spirit so
[1:03:52] now the most dangerous thing in a family
[1:03:54] is a family spirit something that's been
[1:03:57] passed down from generation to
[1:03:59] generation to generation it becomes part
[1:04:02] of the family i mean you take a spirit
[1:04:04] of abuse you take a spirit of
[1:04:06] drunkenness depression i mean anxiety
[1:04:09] indifference can't forgive stubbornness
[1:04:12] those things are family traits they're
[1:04:14] spirits that are passed down through
[1:04:16] families so now here he had consecrated
[1:04:19] his son
[1:04:20] to minister this family spirit
[1:04:23] right this is what he's doing in his
[1:04:25] home amen and you know you've got to
[1:04:27] think about what you really minister
[1:04:29] will manifest in your life now i want to
[1:04:31] talk about man minister is is now i say
[1:04:33] lord help me because this is very much
[1:04:35] it always the word is a two-week assault
[1:04:37] it cuts both ways but you know what we
[1:04:39] minister we minister it by our words
[1:04:42] our actions what we talk about we're
[1:04:44] ministering something i mean so if we're
[1:04:47] ministering if we have a depressed
[1:04:48] depressed spirit we'll be ministering
[1:04:51] poor me and no one cares and look at my
[1:04:53] situation always inward down you know
[1:04:55] and that can become a familiar spirit
[1:04:58] right or you know
[1:05:00] anxiety or stubbornness unforgiveness
[1:05:03] what is stubbornness stubbornness is
[1:05:04] manifested by actions and words
[1:05:06] but it can become an idol why because
[1:05:08] people put it give it place in their
[1:05:10] lives we you know
[1:05:13] this is not built for the devil that's
[1:05:15] right we're not built we're not built i
[1:05:17] mean the
[1:05:18] human being is built to be a resting
[1:05:20] place or for almighty god i mean because
[1:05:22] he because god even said isaiah i made
[1:05:24] the stars i made the galaxies i made the
[1:05:26] universes the nebulas asteroids all kind
[1:05:29] of things i mean i made the solar
[1:05:30] systems you know i made the earth you
[1:05:32] know i made these things but where is
[1:05:34] the place of my rest and we should be
[1:05:36] able to say here i am lord i am
[1:05:38] rest amen my soul is the place of your
[1:05:41] rest amen so this is what we're built
[1:05:43] for we're not built to be a habitation
[1:05:45] of devils we're not built to be a
[1:05:46] habitation of idols and we're built to
[1:05:48] be the dwelling place of the living god
[1:05:52] amen so we don't want to so a family
[1:05:55] idol
[1:05:56] now brother brahm says this and sir we
[1:05:58] would see jesus you must never look at
[1:06:00] the things in the natural look at the
[1:06:01] spirit of anything you want to look uh
[1:06:04] you want to look at a city you look at
[1:06:06] the spirit of it you look at a family
[1:06:08] look at the spirits in the family
[1:06:12] i mean look at a man look at the spirit
[1:06:13] that's in him see anything you're
[1:06:14] looking at everything's got a motive and
[1:06:17] objective see he says look in the
[1:06:19] spirits look at the spirits in the
[1:06:21] family so they'll be family spirits
[1:06:24] hello
[1:06:27] amen they're all here unfortunately but
[1:06:30] you know the spirit of our family should
[1:06:32] be by the new birth the baptism of the
[1:06:34] holy ghost amen amen right so the blind
[1:06:36] family spirit i pray is the lord jesus
[1:06:38] christ amen
[1:06:40] not what i was born with not what i
[1:06:42] inherited you know we can't live in life
[1:06:44] saying poor me i'm a victim of
[1:06:45] circumstance we're not a victim of
[1:06:47] circumstance well actually there's one
[1:06:49] circumstance we should be a victim of
[1:06:51] and i'll put it this way which is the
[1:06:53] blood of jesus christ amen the salvation
[1:06:55] deliverance for our souls and our bodies
[1:06:57] we should be the victim of that i mean
[1:06:59] i've been impacted by an event amen
[1:07:01] that's changed my life hallelujah and
[1:07:03] it's not an abuse it's not a bad
[1:07:05] relationship it's not hurts and pains
[1:07:07] and resentment and unbelief and you know
[1:07:09] you know you know unforgiveness and it's
[1:07:12] not those things the one event i've been
[1:07:14] impacted by is the is the lord
[1:07:17] purchasing my salvation that day on
[1:07:19] calvary i mean and coming in this day to
[1:07:21] claim me holy to take me away in a
[1:07:22] rapture that's the that's the event we
[1:07:24] should be a victim of hey man
[1:07:27] if i can put it that way
[1:07:28] amen but the thing is the thing that
[1:07:30] impacts you most in your life is the
[1:07:32] thing you'll be manifesting
[1:07:34] so we want to be manifesting i mean the
[1:07:37] victory he'd won for us on calvary
[1:07:41] amen
[1:07:42] hallelujah now let's keep going on amen
[1:07:45] so now
[1:07:47] brother brown here he is speaking of a
[1:07:49] he so he's talking about an interview he
[1:07:51] has in the message called paradox i'm
[1:07:53] just going to read a bit of a lengthy
[1:07:54] reading here but you know he he's
[1:07:56] speaking to a father and a mother
[1:07:59] whose boy um has
[1:08:02] um he she's having a courtship with this
[1:08:04] girl and she does something to her and
[1:08:07] just or does something and and he just
[1:08:09] won't forgive her and they're all upset
[1:08:11] because they're shocked by by how he
[1:08:13] seems like a good christian boy you know
[1:08:15] but but yet he he responds in this way
[1:08:18] and and they're just perplexed by it so
[1:08:19] they go to the prophet and then brother
[1:08:21] brown begins to speak about their family
[1:08:22] lines and brings it down i'm just
[1:08:24] showing how how how family spirits right
[1:08:26] or a family idol is unfortunately
[1:08:28] inherited whether we like it or not but
[1:08:31] by the blood of jesus christ by the true
[1:08:33] new birth i mean those things are
[1:08:35] destroyed and kicked out it's good to
[1:08:38] have a house cleaning now
[1:08:40] you thinking you have and having it is
[1:08:42] two different things i mean oh we could
[1:08:44] just spend the rest of the service on
[1:08:45] that amen to think you know there's a
[1:08:47] big difference saying i think i have the
[1:08:49] holy ghost and really having it there's
[1:08:51] a big chasm of difference i mean because
[1:08:54] one is a mental i think i have and then
[1:08:56] normally there's a list of points well i
[1:08:58] got baptized i repented i got baptized
[1:09:01] all those things are good i mean i've
[1:09:02] received the work that's perfectly fine
[1:09:04] i believe all the doctrines i'm i go to
[1:09:06] church those things are all perfectly
[1:09:08] fine but there must come a place in your
[1:09:10] life where you meet god i mean with the
[1:09:12] same pillar of fire that was
[1:09:13] photographed with the prophet of the
[1:09:14] same purify that met you i mean because
[1:09:16] that pillar of fire is the same one that
[1:09:18] met moses that met paul and it came down
[1:09:20] in many forms you've got to meet that
[1:09:22] lord jesus
[1:09:24] you might be able to try and say you
[1:09:26] have and you might be able to show some
[1:09:28] evidence of some emotion but unless your
[1:09:30] life is vindicating what you possess
[1:09:32] what you're possessing to have you still
[1:09:34] haven't got it no matter how many
[1:09:36] emotions how much you jump run
[1:09:38] sensations speaking in tongues or
[1:09:39] shouting whatever you make might lay it
[1:09:41] upon which is all right i believe in all
[1:09:44] of that and i absolutely do too but
[1:09:46] unless your life copes with your
[1:09:48] testimony then you haven't got it
[1:09:50] because the fruit of the spirit
[1:09:51] vindicates what you are just like the
[1:09:54] fruit of any tree what it is jesus said
[1:09:56] by their fruits ye shall know them now
[1:09:59] this young fellow's parents his mother
[1:10:01] is german
[1:10:02] no reflection on the german but there is
[1:10:05] a strain in that family and that is
[1:10:07] they'll just sit and you can talk to
[1:10:08] them and they'll just stare right you
[1:10:11] stare you right in the face this girl's
[1:10:14] sister the mother of this boy her sister
[1:10:16] i have come down the street many morning
[1:10:18] and this young lady be sitting out in
[1:10:19] the yard i'd say good morning to you
[1:10:21] she'd just look at me i'd stop i'd say
[1:10:23] sure a fine morning she she would just
[1:10:26] stand look right at you an intelligent
[1:10:28] woman i'd say come up to see her
[1:10:30] sometime she just stand and look well
[1:10:32] her brothers are that way father and
[1:10:34] mother is that way now the father of the
[1:10:36] boy is strictly an irishman moody high
[1:10:38] tempered high strong that's his whole
[1:10:40] family like that except one
[1:10:43] other out of the family converted that
[1:10:45] is this boy this fatherless mother are
[1:10:47] christians filled with the holy ghost
[1:10:49] and they have brought this young man up
[1:10:51] in the way of the lord now the young man
[1:10:53] is about 17 or 18 years old some
[1:10:55] something along there very fine kid and
[1:10:58] he's been a real model boy at home nice
[1:11:00] kid and he's got a brother that's just
[1:11:02] vice versa but the girls
[1:11:04] uh the the mother's family lives close
[1:11:07] to a fine church but do you think they'd
[1:11:09] ever
[1:11:10] come over there no and they know it's
[1:11:12] right but it's just not in them to ask
[1:11:14] forgiveness or ask pardoning they just
[1:11:16] won't do it it's just not in them
[1:11:19] now the genes and the father and and the
[1:11:21] mother of this boy no matter how much
[1:11:23] they are converted still remains in the
[1:11:24] flesh that's been interbred out to this
[1:11:27] boy therefore the boy has got a complex
[1:11:30] in him just like from this mother's
[1:11:32] family and they are not forgiving and
[1:11:34] they'll not apologize and that's where
[1:11:36] that boy stands now i said to the father
[1:11:38] no matter how much you've raised him up
[1:11:40] i said now look at you out of out of
[1:11:42] your family all of them drunks and
[1:11:44] fighting and shooting and cutting and so
[1:11:45] forth now look at your family to the
[1:11:47] mother there are a bunch of people they
[1:11:49] just sit there won't speak very
[1:11:51] independent so forth irreverent to
[1:11:53] religion but i said it's not you you're
[1:11:55] the only one of all your sisters and
[1:11:57] brothers and you are sweet and kind and
[1:11:59] forgiving what does it
[1:12:01] and your
[1:12:03] tree part of the family tree yet you
[1:12:05] have received the holy ghost that's the
[1:12:08] thing that makes you tender and sweet
[1:12:11] that's not your people anymore it's your
[1:12:13] christ that lives in you i said to the
[1:12:16] boy look at your family practically all
[1:12:17] them are drunks and so forth i said and
[1:12:19] how moody and high tempered and high
[1:12:21] strung but you're not
[1:12:22] you're kind forgiving what is it the
[1:12:24] holy spirit you're no more what you are
[1:12:26] it's christ in you i said now that same
[1:12:29] thing has to happen to your son
[1:12:32] and the father raised up and said my son
[1:12:34] went to the altar he was baptized
[1:12:36] correctly in the name of jesus christ
[1:12:38] and water baptism in the pool said i i
[1:12:41] know my son has come to christ so he was
[1:12:43] adamant he's a believer
[1:12:46] i said that maybe all right all the
[1:12:47] outward motions he might be identified
[1:12:50] as a believer with the believers but
[1:12:51] until he's regenerated born again i'd
[1:12:54] advise that young man to never marry a
[1:12:55] woman he'll make hell on earth for her
[1:12:58] unless that gentle sweet forgiving
[1:12:59] spirit of christ comes in then that will
[1:13:02] be a paradox in itself to take the very
[1:13:04] nature of a boy that's bred between
[1:13:06] father and mother and yet in his
[1:13:07] intellectuals he's trying his best to
[1:13:09] overcome it he can't do it he'll never
[1:13:11] overcome it christ will have to overcome
[1:13:13] it when he lets christ and then he's
[1:13:16] already overcome then it'll be a perfect
[1:13:18] paradox when a man is born of the spirit
[1:13:21] of god so in other words when the holy
[1:13:24] ghost comes in all those family idols
[1:13:26] those family idols are demolished in the
[1:13:28] name of jesus christ and the lord god
[1:13:30] takes up residence there amen and that's
[1:13:33] what we need friends that's very
[1:13:34] essential because even this mad boy
[1:13:36] outwardly looking i mean he was a good
[1:13:39] christian so it seems but in him that
[1:13:42] had to be taken out
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:45] now
[1:13:46] let's continue on with our story
[1:13:48] and there was a young man out of
[1:13:49] bethlehem judah of the family of judah
[1:13:52] who was a levite and he sojourned there
[1:13:55] and the man departed out of the city
[1:13:57] from bethlehem judah to sojourn where he
[1:14:00] could find a place and he came to mount
[1:14:02] e frame to the house of micah as he
[1:14:04] journeyed and monika said unto him
[1:14:06] when's cometh thou and he said unto him
[1:14:09] i'm a levite of bethlehem judah and i go
[1:14:12] to sojourn where i may find a place
[1:14:14] and micah said unto him dwell with me
[1:14:16] and be unto me a father and a priest and
[1:14:19] i'll give thee ten shekels of silver by
[1:14:21] the year and a suit of apparel and and
[1:14:23] thy vituls
[1:14:25] so the levite went in
[1:14:28] and the levite was content to dwell with
[1:14:30] the man and the young man was under him
[1:14:32] as one of his sons and micah consecrated
[1:14:35] the levite and the young man became his
[1:14:37] priest and in the house and was in the
[1:14:40] house of micah and then micah said now i
[1:14:43] now know i that the lord will do me good
[1:14:46] seeing i have a levite to my priest
[1:14:50] again
[1:14:51] to me this is insanity
[1:14:55] they will take it and adapt it to their
[1:14:57] own lifestyle i mean a way that's
[1:14:59] pleasing to them they want jesus as
[1:15:01] their savior but not their lord their
[1:15:02] ruler so here he was now micah thought
[1:15:05] oh good you know i had my son as a
[1:15:07] priest but you know he's not a levite
[1:15:09] but the word says we need a levite to be
[1:15:11] a priest oh and he comes this levite and
[1:15:14] uh you know so he invites him because he
[1:15:16] wants to live the word right and so now
[1:15:18] finally he's got this levite as a priest
[1:15:19] so now he's thinking the lord's going to
[1:15:21] do me good seeing i have a levite to to
[1:15:24] my priest
[1:15:25] but this levite was now being a priest
[1:15:28] in a house full of idols
[1:15:29] this family spirit you know he was
[1:15:33] he had
[1:15:34] he had been away where were gone
[1:15:38] why on earth is this levite being a
[1:15:40] priest in a house full of idols when he
[1:15:42] could be ministering the word of god in
[1:15:45] its power amen because the word that
[1:15:47] that levite was ordained to minister was
[1:15:50] the same word that opened the red sea i
[1:15:53] mean phil
[1:15:54] fed the israelites in the wilderness
[1:15:56] amen that they you know their clothes
[1:15:58] were out their shoes didn't wear out
[1:15:59] amen fed them amen gave them spiritual
[1:16:02] revelation amen part of the jordan
[1:16:04] brought down jericho brought them
[1:16:06] victory after victory supernaturally
[1:16:09] that was the word amen that this levite
[1:16:11] should have been ministering but instead
[1:16:13] of that he was ministering a family idol
[1:16:15] he was ministering a bunch of idols in a
[1:16:17] house amen that were just dead you know
[1:16:20] complexes are dead
[1:16:22] i mean family spirits are dead they have
[1:16:24] no value in them i mean to hold on to a
[1:16:26] spirit of bitterness it'll just kill you
[1:16:28] let's be honest i mean it's not going to
[1:16:30] give you victory it's not going to give
[1:16:32] you joy in a spirit of depression i've
[1:16:34] never seen a happy depressed person
[1:16:37] i mean they've always been depressed and
[1:16:39] has it helped them not know but it's an
[1:16:42] evil spirit warding them off from the
[1:16:44] promises of god i mean when the
[1:16:46] scripture says whatever things are good
[1:16:47] and honest and lovely and a good report
[1:16:50] think on those things but a spirit of
[1:16:51] your pressure always make it look at the
[1:16:53] negative and this person did this and
[1:16:54] brother so-and-so didn't do this and
[1:16:56] sister so-and-so did this and ignored
[1:16:58] this and this is what happened here and
[1:16:59] pour me and look at the state i'm in but
[1:17:01] this but the word says amen godliness
[1:17:04] with contentment is great gain amen and
[1:17:07] whatever state we're currently in the
[1:17:09] bible says this is the will of god
[1:17:10] concerning you and i i mean so we should
[1:17:12] be believing if we're the bride of
[1:17:14] christ in our footsteps are ordered of
[1:17:16] the lord that a good day is a good day
[1:17:18] because it's god's ordained day amen it
[1:17:20] doesn't matter see we aren't christians
[1:17:22] because everything goes well
[1:17:24] we're not message believers because life
[1:17:25] is a bunch of roses and god you know god
[1:17:27] never promised us a flowery bed of ease
[1:17:30] i mean but he promised us a battle he
[1:17:32] promised us a campaign he promised us a
[1:17:34] victory i mean he promised us a war
[1:17:36] that's what he promised us amen we're
[1:17:38] not here for a sunday school picnic
[1:17:39] we're here for a battle but many
[1:17:41] thousands of battles are within right
[1:17:43] it's not always the external oh the
[1:17:45] world's doing this and who cares about
[1:17:47] what the world's doing i mean god has
[1:17:49] allowed the world to do what it does it
[1:17:50] says in the book of revelations that he
[1:17:52] put his
[1:17:54] god put it in the hearts of people to
[1:17:55] fulfill his word and these are people
[1:17:57] who have no idea about him they don't
[1:17:59] care about him whatsoever they're doing
[1:18:00] what they think they should be doing but
[1:18:02] god put it in their hearts to fulfill
[1:18:04] his will so this whole world you see is
[1:18:06] actually man fulfilling the will of god
[1:18:09] whether they're aware of it or not this
[1:18:11] whole world so don't get stressed about
[1:18:12] it i mean lift up your head and know
[1:18:14] your redemption is during night
[1:18:16] hallelujah there's got to be a pressure
[1:18:18] you take israel in egypt they were
[1:18:20] living in the best part of land they're
[1:18:22] living in goshen well-watered part of
[1:18:24] the land i mean do you think they would
[1:18:25] pack up there and go to the promised
[1:18:27] land that and you know they had to
[1:18:29] invade and and and cast out the enemies
[1:18:32] before them and fight a campaign they
[1:18:33] wouldn't have done that in their own
[1:18:35] ability i mean i mean they wouldn't have
[1:18:36] done that in their own desire because
[1:18:38] they had a nice place to live that's why
[1:18:40] god had to put a pressure on them
[1:18:42] where they had to realize hey we can't
[1:18:44] stay here anymore
[1:18:46] we cannot stay as slaves anymore we're
[1:18:48] not ordained to be in this position we
[1:18:50] must leave then they called upon the
[1:18:52] name of the lord amen and god heard
[1:18:54] heard their cry and delivered them and
[1:18:56] that's to see and that's the same thing
[1:18:58] with us you know we cannot be content
[1:19:01] with soft living
[1:19:02] brother braham says in one place it's a
[1:19:04] curse
[1:19:05] soft living is actually a curse right so
[1:19:08] we we can't just be content because this
[1:19:11] world wants to dull us to sleep
[1:19:14] it wants to distract us
[1:19:15] look at this listen to this this person
[1:19:17] said this and this politician is doing
[1:19:19] this and this sportsman did this and
[1:19:21] this person's doing this and this is the
[1:19:22] code and this is the blah blah and you
[1:19:24] know who cares about the blah blah blah
[1:19:26] it's just blah blah blah it's not going
[1:19:28] to get us in a rapture you think talking
[1:19:30] negative doesn't build your faith
[1:19:33] but what is it you're ministering to an
[1:19:34] idol you're ministering through an idol
[1:19:36] oh great spirit of lust or great spirit
[1:19:39] of depression oh a great spirit of
[1:19:40] anxiety you call upon it like it's some
[1:19:42] great big thing and you wonder why we
[1:19:44] have no victory it's because who are you
[1:19:46] calling on right have you said lord
[1:19:48] these not a bunch of filthy nonsense and
[1:19:50] kick it out my door i want you to be the
[1:19:52] cameraman
[1:19:54] amen but you see the problem is now
[1:19:56] people use the message as a lucky
[1:19:59] rabbit's foot
[1:20:01] i have a picture of it somewhere i'll
[1:20:03] come back to this
[1:20:04] and we'll come back to that
[1:20:06] now who can see the rabbit's feet
[1:20:09] oliver
[1:20:10] people believed
[1:20:12] people believed it was lucky to have a
[1:20:13] rabbit's foot and it's just a tradition
[1:20:15] from actually pretty much a big big part
[1:20:18] of the world now in some parts of the
[1:20:20] world
[1:20:21] this tradition
[1:20:23] came from
[1:20:25] something called the hand of glory and
[1:20:26] that hand of glory was actually what
[1:20:28] they'd do as someone who had been hung
[1:20:30] or executed they would take their left
[1:20:33] hand they would cut it off they'd
[1:20:34] preserve it and they would have that
[1:20:38] now this is you say well that's crazy
[1:20:40] why would have a dead man's criminal's
[1:20:42] hand you know as as as some kind of
[1:20:44] lucky token that's crazy well this is
[1:20:46] crazy too having rabbit's feet and it's
[1:20:48] crazy to have the message as a lucky
[1:20:51] rabbit's foot now what i mean by that
[1:20:52] it's just something in the background
[1:20:54] that if you need him you know oh i'll
[1:20:56] call upon him i'll rub him you know oh
[1:20:58] lord a great god of power come help me
[1:21:01] but you know our lives still go on the
[1:21:03] same way we still do what we want to do
[1:21:05] and you know we still you know we don't
[1:21:06] want god to rearrange our hearts and
[1:21:08] take away things and you know it's just
[1:21:10] like you know
[1:21:11] some now listen i believe in listening
[1:21:13] to the message
[1:21:16] when i drive to work i have the tapes
[1:21:18] playing right if i'm at work and i don't
[1:21:20] need to concentrate too much i'm
[1:21:22] listening right so i believe it you know
[1:21:24] i believe we should do that we should
[1:21:25] listen to the bible we should read the
[1:21:26] bible we should read the message we
[1:21:28] should listen to it but we can't let it
[1:21:30] just become background noise that it
[1:21:32] doesn't affect our lives now if you want
[1:21:34] to play it in the background that's
[1:21:35] perfectly fine praise the lord for that
[1:21:37] but i trust it's impacting you all right
[1:21:39] i trust that's changing your trust is
[1:21:41] anchoring into your spirit right it's
[1:21:43] not just you know noise that is just in
[1:21:46] the background at all but i'm playing
[1:21:47] the message you know i'm i'm pushing
[1:21:49] play i'm you know no that's just an idol
[1:21:52] if i can say it that way because it's
[1:21:53] just a rabbit's foot that's just in the
[1:21:55] background like some kind of buffer
[1:21:57] world are the words playing no but
[1:21:58] what's it doing to you well it's
[1:22:00] impacting your life is it transforming
[1:22:02] you i mean because this word has
[1:22:04] transforming power brother brown
[1:22:06] preached two services and they basically
[1:22:07] called the power god's power to
[1:22:09] transform and you know god's
[1:22:10] transforming power something like that
[1:22:12] he says this word has come as
[1:22:13] brotherhood was said to be transformed
[1:22:15] back to what we're meant to be in the
[1:22:16] beginning this is what this message has
[1:22:18] come it's full of transforming power to
[1:22:20] take a crippled up bunch of people in
[1:22:22] darkness and transform them amen that
[1:22:24] they would become the sons and daughters
[1:22:26] of god
[1:22:27] so
[1:22:28] is everyone following me
[1:22:30] this message be a lucky rabbit's foot
[1:22:34] to you
[1:22:35] don't diminish the word of god to be
[1:22:38] some crutch
[1:22:39] no it should be our all in all amen
[1:22:42] our very life
[1:22:43] amen it should be the very center of our
[1:22:46] lives not something on the periphery
[1:22:48] that like a hobby that you pick up from
[1:22:50] time to time and all the weather's good
[1:22:52] so you know i'll go do this you know
[1:22:55] that
[1:22:56] don't put it in that bracket
[1:22:58] it should be the center of your life
[1:23:02] amen
[1:23:03] let's go back where are we
[1:23:04] oh yeah we'll come to there
[1:23:07] yeah so he's got this priest now
[1:23:09] now i'm going to show you how idols are
[1:23:11] spirits
[1:23:13] and there came a certain of the elders
[1:23:15] of israel into me and sat before me now
[1:23:16] to me this is astounding just just
[1:23:19] what i've gotten yellow but let's read
[1:23:21] author and the word of the lord came
[1:23:22] unto me saying son of man
[1:23:24] these men have set up their idols and
[1:23:26] their heart and put a stumbling block of
[1:23:28] their iniquity before their face
[1:23:30] should i be inquired at um of at all by
[1:23:34] them therefore speak unto them and say
[1:23:36] to them thus saith the lord god every
[1:23:37] man of the house of israel that setteth
[1:23:40] up his idols in his heart and putteth
[1:23:42] the stumbling block of his iniquity
[1:23:44] before his face and cometh to the
[1:23:46] prophet i the lord will answer him that
[1:23:49] cometh according to the multitude
[1:23:52] of his idols that i may take the house
[1:23:55] of israel in their own heart because
[1:23:57] they are all estranged from me
[1:23:59] through the idols now
[1:24:01] just just
[1:24:02] let's just look at that yellow
[1:24:04] i the lord will answer him that cometh
[1:24:06] according to the multitude
[1:24:09] of his idols
[1:24:10] so what the idol is i'll answer
[1:24:12] according to that
[1:24:15] so for example
[1:24:17] there's an idol where predestination
[1:24:20] goes to the extreme
[1:24:22] if you're gonna make it you'll make it
[1:24:24] if not you're not
[1:24:26] or if i can put it this way brother
[1:24:27] brown said everyone who you ever loved
[1:24:30] or loves you is going to be there
[1:24:32] come on you know honey just say you love
[1:24:33] brother brown and you'll be there oh no
[1:24:35] but my kids love me and i love them so
[1:24:37] they have to be there
[1:24:38] hold on
[1:24:40] that's an idol yeah amen you've got to
[1:24:42] believe on the lord jesus christ for thy
[1:24:44] house and they shall be saved that's
[1:24:46] right amen it's more than just saying
[1:24:49] well they love me and i love them just
[1:24:50] some kind of human love that goes back
[1:24:52] and forth it's more than that
[1:24:54] amen but
[1:24:55] it can become an idol where where
[1:24:57] they're idols in the person's heart and
[1:24:59] when they listen to the word they're
[1:25:00] listening through that pile and all they
[1:25:02] can do is rejoice and praise the lord
[1:25:04] we're all going to be there and somehow
[1:25:05] god's going to flip the switch and you
[1:25:07] know you know my family is going to be
[1:25:09] saved you know on their death bed or
[1:25:11] just before the rapture you know brother
[1:25:12] ram says god doesn't just flick the
[1:25:14] switch and change the spirit in you just
[1:25:16] before you die that's right you've got
[1:25:17] to make a decision and give your life
[1:25:19] now
[1:25:20] right that's why we're believing for our
[1:25:22] families we're actively i trust you're
[1:25:23] actively believing yes sir hallelujah
[1:25:26] now you do not look at the things that
[1:25:28] are seen be looking to the promise of
[1:25:30] god
[1:25:31] amen or what's another idol people have
[1:25:33] well you can just go through the message
[1:25:34] there's plenty i mean message community
[1:25:36] if i put it that way return ministry oh
[1:25:38] hey brother brown's going to come back
[1:25:39] and preach again you know we're all
[1:25:41] looking for a big revival when the
[1:25:42] prophet comes back no that's not going
[1:25:44] to happen because the lord jesus christ
[1:25:46] the one he introduced is here i mean the
[1:25:48] bride's revival is a recognition
[1:25:50] supernatural revelation that the
[1:25:52] bridegroom himself his spirit is upon
[1:25:54] the earth uniting himself with a people
[1:25:57] hallelujah where we realize who we are
[1:25:59] in christ we see it in heavenly places
[1:26:01] right now hallelujah amen having
[1:26:03] dominion and power over every work of
[1:26:06] the devil and the devil himself hello
[1:26:08] when we recognize who we are then the
[1:26:10] rapture will go amen
[1:26:12] but it can become an idol or an idol can
[1:26:15] be you know just push play we we don't
[1:26:17] need to go to church anymore
[1:26:20] amen the prophet never threw the
[1:26:22] five-fold ministry out the five-fold
[1:26:24] ministry is still here ephesians 4 is
[1:26:25] still an effect right until the body
[1:26:28] until the body's changed
[1:26:30] amen but it can become an idol you know
[1:26:32] people just ah you know because brother
[1:26:34] graham said you know the that you know
[1:26:36] the evidence of the baptism of the holy
[1:26:37] ghost is to receive the word in your day
[1:26:39] and people say i've received the word
[1:26:40] but their lives haven't been transformed
[1:26:43] it's just a myth but but it can become
[1:26:44] an idol people just hear those things oh
[1:26:46] i've received the word have you received
[1:26:47] the word and they say it like a creed
[1:26:49] yes i've received the word i believe
[1:26:50] brother brown is a prophet of the age
[1:26:51] and revelations 10 has been fulfilled
[1:26:53] and here we are and you know it can just
[1:26:55] become a saying
[1:26:57] but we're not here to just live through
[1:26:58] a bunch of creeds because that's a creed
[1:27:00] a creed is just a recited list of words
[1:27:03] basically yeah a profession of faith
[1:27:05] with no life behind it
[1:27:07] but it can become an idol but that's
[1:27:09] what people hear praise the lord you
[1:27:10] know you know because why because god
[1:27:12] answers them according to their idol
[1:27:15] i pray lord jesus may we have no idols
[1:27:19] that when the word comes forth when you
[1:27:20] read the scripture when you hear the
[1:27:21] message when you're in church when you
[1:27:23] hear preaching that it's not through
[1:27:25] some kind of filter
[1:27:26] of an idol
[1:27:27] but it's the holy ghost it just
[1:27:29] ministers this whole word i mean
[1:27:31] whatever he has for me
[1:27:32] lord i want to i want to take it that
[1:27:34] way i don't want to have some idol that
[1:27:36] you answered me through that
[1:27:38] and there's many more but i just want to
[1:27:39] use those as some examples everyone
[1:27:40] following me
[1:27:43] to answer us according to the multitude
[1:27:46] of
[1:27:46] our idols
[1:27:49] amen we want him to speak to us
[1:27:50] according to his word what we have need
[1:27:53] of
[1:27:54] amen make us balance more make us
[1:27:57] balanced
[1:27:58] hallelujah
[1:27:59] sighing and crying for the abominations
[1:28:01] done in the city but yet full of joy
[1:28:03] unspeakable full of glory because we
[1:28:04] have eternal life and we're going in a
[1:28:06] rapture
[1:28:07] amen we should be i mean burden for lost
[1:28:10] souls but so thankful we're in amen
[1:28:13] that's how we should
[1:28:14] i mean believing actively believing i

[1:28:33] idol is anything we put before god in
[1:28:35] our heart it could be a job a person
[1:28:38] activity an idea a thing or even
[1:28:40] ourselves that means i found that
[1:28:43] picture there's a man bowing down those

[1:28:48] i pray oh lord jesus cleanse it all out
[1:28:50] lord jesus and just made only be you
[1:28:54] right you're following me
[1:28:57] we don't want the lord to answer
[1:28:58] according to those kind of idols we want
[1:29:00] him to come and speak now
[1:29:02] it says now we know this that in the
[1:29:03] last days perilous times shall come who
[1:29:05] believes her in the last days
[1:29:08] hallelujah it's going to be perilous
[1:29:10] times for men shall be lovers of their
[1:29:12] own selves so they'll love themselves
[1:29:14] covetous boasts proud blasphemous
[1:29:17] disobedient appearance unthankful unholy
[1:29:20] without natural affection truce breakers
[1:29:22] false accusers incontinent fierce
[1:29:25] despise of those that are good traitors
[1:29:27] heady high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:29:29] more than lovers of god having a form of
[1:29:31] godliness but denying the power from
[1:29:33] such turn away
[1:29:35] for of this sort are they which creep
[1:29:37] into houses and lead silly women um and
[1:29:40] leave sorry lead captive silly woman
[1:29:42] later with sins led away with diverse
[1:29:44] lusts ever learning and never able to
[1:29:47] come to the knowledge of the truth what
[1:29:50] is that that is a whole big list of
[1:29:52] idols
[1:29:53] if i can just put it that way real
[1:29:55] simply to love yourself why your idol is
[1:29:57] yourself covetous i want this i want
[1:29:59] that i want that that's now another idol
[1:30:01] boasters it's pride and blasphemous
[1:30:04] disobedient to parents all those things
[1:30:06] is an idol amen that needs to be smashed
[1:30:09] down because this is the condition of
[1:30:11] the last days i'll say friends without
[1:30:14] the holy ghost we'll be caught up in
[1:30:16] this anointing we don't want to be
[1:30:18] caught up in this kind of anointing we
[1:30:19] want to be caught up in the lord jesus
[1:30:21] christ amen amen
[1:30:23] amen
[1:30:24] amen who has delivered us from the power
[1:30:26] of darkness and hath translated us into
[1:30:28] the kingdom of his dear son in whom we
[1:30:30] have redemption through his blood even
[1:30:32] the forgiveness of sins who is the image
[1:30:34] of the invisible god the firstborn of
[1:30:36] every creature for by him were all
[1:30:38] things created that are in heaven and
[1:30:40] that are on earth visible and invisible
[1:30:42] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[1:30:44] principalities or powers all things were
[1:30:47] created by him and for him and he is
[1:30:50] before all things and by him all things
[1:30:51] consist and he is the head of the body
[1:30:53] the church who is the beginning the
[1:30:55] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:30:57] things he might have preeminence and all
[1:31:00] things he might be number
[1:31:03] one
[1:31:04] so we read there and judges says well
[1:31:06] there's no king in that day well
[1:31:07] actually there was a king in that day
[1:31:08] which still was jehovah god
[1:31:11] he was their king
[1:31:12] amen but they are looking for a physical
[1:31:14] natural king but they already had a king
[1:31:17] remember when they when they wanted saul
[1:31:19] to be a king or when when they asked
[1:31:21] samuel rather to have a king
[1:31:23] samuel was very displeased about it but
[1:31:25] they said to samuel samuel they're not
[1:31:27] rejecting you they're rejecting me
[1:31:29] why because they want an earthly king
[1:31:31] instead of a spiritual king god is our
[1:31:34] king
[1:31:35] right he's not just our savior he's to
[1:31:37] be our king he wants to have preeminence
[1:31:39] that he might come live through a people
[1:31:42] again
[1:31:44] amen he said it's not for you to know
[1:31:46] the times or seasons that the uh what
[1:31:48] the father has put in his own mind but
[1:31:51] you shall receive power acts one you
[1:31:52] shall receive power after the holy ghost
[1:31:54] has come upon you you shall receive
[1:31:56] power after you be made a bishop after
[1:31:58] you've been made a preacher after you've
[1:31:59] been made a pope after you made a priest
[1:32:02] no you shall receive power after holy
[1:32:03] ghost has come on you that's the witness
[1:32:05] that god was looking for a witness after
[1:32:07] the holy ghost is come not a witness
[1:32:10] that i'm a bishop i'm a witness that i'm
[1:32:11] a pastor but a witness of what of the
[1:32:13] resurrected king that's the true church
[1:32:15] the living god all right who is the head
[1:32:18] of the church jesus christ what kingdom
[1:32:20] is it the messianic kingdom the church
[1:32:22] not an organization a church a mystic
[1:32:24] body to which christ is the head and oh
[1:32:28] oh i love that walking in the spirit
[1:32:30] obeying the king foolish to the world
[1:32:32] precious in the sight of god walking in
[1:32:34] the spirit misunderstood laughter made
[1:32:36] fun of all that live godly in christ
[1:32:38] jesus shall suffer persecutions if they
[1:32:41] are persecuted they persecuted the
[1:32:43] prophets which were before you call um
[1:32:45] called the lord of the building bells
[1:32:47] above how much more will they call them
[1:32:49] of his disciples but you're walking in
[1:32:51] the spirit turning your back to the
[1:32:53] things of the world not bound by any
[1:32:55] fetus he who the son has made free is
[1:32:57] free indeed amen that's the church of
[1:32:58] the living god thanks who set it up
[1:33:02] now we see in acts one and eight
[1:33:04] you shall be he said you shall be my
[1:33:06] witnesses after the holy ghost has come
[1:33:08] on you what is the church the mystic
[1:33:10] body of christ who set it up the lord
[1:33:12] jesus himself it wasn't set up at rome
[1:33:14] neither was it set up in england by john
[1:33:16] wesley neither was set up by calvin or
[1:33:18] in america the baptist or john smith
[1:33:20] neither was it set up in california by
[1:33:22] the pentecostals it was set up by jesus
[1:33:24] christ the king of the messianic kingdom
[1:33:26] and who is it set up by he is the king
[1:33:29] he wants to be king he wants to rule us
[1:33:32] he wants to be
[1:33:33] lord
[1:33:35] don't use them as a lucky rabbit's foot
[1:33:38] may he be your lord and savior not just
[1:33:40] your savior that's like a rabbit's foot
[1:33:42] oh when i need him i'll call upon no
[1:33:44] he's got to be both
[1:33:47] amen now
[1:33:49] i just want to just come here
[1:33:53] if
[1:33:54] if the message if if the lord himself
[1:33:57] has been received by us
[1:33:59] he gives the power to become the sons of
[1:34:01] god
[1:34:02] if it's if he's just a lucky rabbit's
[1:34:04] foot there's no power in the life
[1:34:06] there can be a lot more a lot of outward
[1:34:08] conformity to to the message or you know
[1:34:11] to
[1:34:12] i'll put it that way the message kind of
[1:34:14] you know the your bible way of doing
[1:34:16] things but what about the transformation
[1:34:18] of a character a transformation of a
[1:34:20] soul
[1:34:21] amen that we're not just
[1:34:23] religious people
[1:34:24] but god himself has come in see this is
[1:34:26] how we actually oh you know this is how
[1:34:29] we know if you've really received him or
[1:34:31] not that last verse but as many as
[1:34:33] received him to them gave him power to
[1:34:35] become the sons of god even to them that
[1:34:38] believe on his name so that's how really
[1:34:41] that's how you know if you've really
[1:34:42] received him if you receive them up here
[1:34:45] there's no power being given to become a
[1:34:47] son of god so actually to be calm what
[1:34:50] you're ordained what you should be we
[1:34:51] just be a religious person everyone
[1:34:53] following me does that make sense
[1:34:55] because you should be able to look back
[1:34:56] in your life and say well i've gone from
[1:34:59] glory to glory
[1:35:01] right the things i once battled i don't
[1:35:04] battle no more because the lord has
[1:35:05] overcome them in my life his my
[1:35:07] character is more like his character
[1:35:09] remember when joshua and the children of
[1:35:11] israel when they crossed the jordan they
[1:35:13] didn't sit there
[1:35:15] they didn't sit at gilgal
[1:35:17] they went and possessed the land
[1:35:20] right
[1:35:21] they possessed so every complex every
[1:35:23] family spirit every you know everything
[1:35:26] that's been passed down to you by your
[1:35:28] family tree by the new birth what
[1:35:30] happens you conquer those things
[1:35:33] amen amen amen
[1:35:35] trauma of your childhood that gets
[1:35:37] conquered right the spirit that comes in
[1:35:40] through trauma he maybe had a breakdown
[1:35:42] maybe there was your unforgiveness maybe
[1:35:44] something happened in the family maybe
[1:35:46] you've got that trait that you can't
[1:35:47] forgive you can't let go you know you're
[1:35:50] depressed or whatever it is those things
[1:35:51] in the family gets passed down to you by
[1:35:53] the new birth those things get broken
[1:35:58] remember the message did not come to
[1:36:00] teach us how to live with our devils
[1:36:04] right it did not come
[1:36:06] to make us just our flesh conform to a
[1:36:09] religious idea
[1:36:10] no when he comes in this becomes subject
[1:36:13] to the word of god in our lives
[1:36:16] who's with me
[1:36:17] amen amen
[1:36:19] overcomer is actually they actually
[1:36:21] overcome
[1:36:22] right they actually wrestle with
[1:36:23] something and overcome it and then they
[1:36:26] they walk out packing the victory
[1:36:28] hallelujah they don't just walk in and
[1:36:31] live with a stalemate no no we're not
[1:36:32] called to live and stalemate i mean
[1:36:34] because he's received him to them gave
[1:36:36] you power to become the sons of god amen
[1:36:39] not slaves but sons join ears with
[1:36:41] christ seated in heavenly places in
[1:36:43] christ jesus what's that you have
[1:36:45] dominion over the devil you have
[1:36:47] dominion over this flesh you have
[1:36:49] dominion over your past you have
[1:36:50] dominion even over your present i mean
[1:36:52] so should never be
[1:36:54] i'm stuck in this and this is going on
[1:36:56] and everything's wrong no everything's
[1:36:57] right
[1:36:59] hallelujah everything's right amen but
[1:37:02] it depends if you've got idols in your
[1:37:04] heart you'll look at everything's wrong
[1:37:07] and poor me and woe is me no lift up
[1:37:09] your head your redemption is drawing
[1:37:11] mine
[1:37:11] amen
[1:37:13] hallelujah
[1:37:15] amen
[1:37:16] we'll go a bit further
[1:37:18] now notice
[1:37:20] they were not just to come together and
[1:37:22] talk about the message
[1:37:24] they were to get into it to get under
[1:37:27] the blood not just come and say you know
[1:37:29] moses told us the messenger he said he
[1:37:31] told us what we should that we should
[1:37:33] have blood what do you think about it
[1:37:35] boys that wasn't it get the lamb killed
[1:37:38] and get the blood up there
[1:37:39] you we can come and sit and agree with
[1:37:41] the word and everything else but that
[1:37:43] don't have that token
[1:37:45] see it's very good you know people get
[1:37:47] such big complexes that people have to
[1:37:49] receive all the mysteries of the word
[1:37:51] and when someone comes in and agrees
[1:37:52] with them i think praise the lord
[1:37:53] they've got the holy ghost no they can
[1:37:55] just be agreeing with the word
[1:37:57] we can't just get people to mentally
[1:37:59] acknowledge doctrine
[1:38:01] are you following me the life of god
[1:38:03] must come into us i mean to manifest the
[1:38:05] power in that doctrine amen
[1:38:09] revelations 10 has been fulfilled when
[1:38:11] you know the mighty angels come down the
[1:38:12] prophet received the open word he gave
[1:38:14] it to us we're eating it lord we're you
[1:38:16] know you know and we're prophesying
[1:38:17] again that should actually be living out
[1:38:20] amen right i mean when the prophet's on
[1:38:22] sunset mountain the seven angels came to
[1:38:24] him the sword was placed in his hand he
[1:38:26] went back to jeffersonville he preached
[1:38:28] the opening of the seven seals the lamb
[1:38:30] opened the seals and revealed it to him
[1:38:32] right
[1:38:33] it actually happened
[1:38:34] amen so now if we have become one with
[1:38:37] that open word where christ and i become
[1:38:39] one
[1:38:40] it's not just acknowledging that god
[1:38:42] sent a prophet or the seven seals are
[1:38:45] open it's not that it's that same word
[1:38:47] comes into you and i and manifest itself
[1:38:51] that's how it's got to be
[1:38:53] so it's not just to gather around and
[1:38:55] talk about the message hey it's good to
[1:38:57] talk about the message i'm not no don't
[1:38:59] ever get in your head that i'm against
[1:39:01] fellowshipping and talking about the
[1:39:02] word no we should talk about him he's
[1:39:04] lovely
[1:39:05] isn't he wonderful he saved us from the
[1:39:07] home name and he saved us from hell
[1:39:09] hallelujah he's going to take us on a
[1:39:10] rapture he's coming back for me he's
[1:39:12] worth a little longer that's the biggest
[1:39:14] understatement of a lifetime but you
[1:39:15] know so it's not just to talk sit down
[1:39:17] and agree with the word and everything
[1:39:19] else but that don't have that token what
[1:39:22] good does it do us no good get beneath
[1:39:25] it so what in other words let him become
[1:39:27] your lord let him change your life
[1:39:29] amen he was not responsible for anyone
[1:39:31] from under that blood and he is not
[1:39:33] responsible for anybody today out from
[1:39:36] under the token and the holy ghost is
[1:39:38] our identification that identifies us as
[1:39:40] christians not our membership in
[1:39:42] churches not our understanding of the
[1:39:44] bible not how much you know about the
[1:39:46] bible it's how much you know about the
[1:39:48] authorsy
[1:39:49] how much the author is living in
[1:39:51] you
[1:39:52] it's you're you're
[1:39:54] on you're no more you reckon yourself
[1:39:56] dead and the token is what lives in you
[1:39:58] it's not it's not your life it's him
[1:40:01] paul said the life that i now live he
[1:40:03] lived a different life from what he once
[1:40:05] did it is not me but christ liveth in me
[1:40:09] there is
[1:40:10] my token that god required identified
[1:40:12] with our identification with our
[1:40:14] sacrifice the life of our savior in us
[1:40:18] the holy spirit
[1:40:20] amen
[1:40:23] that's the way god sees you it ain't
[1:40:25] what you see your own self it's the way
[1:40:28] god sees you
[1:40:30] no man sees himself wrong i mean micro
[1:40:33] look within the scripture he saw himself
[1:40:35] right that levite saw himself right
[1:40:39] but if they looked in god's mirror of
[1:40:40] his word they would have seen that they
[1:40:42] were deadly wrong when you look in the
[1:40:44] mirror of god's word it tells you
[1:40:45] whether you're wrong or not if david
[1:40:48] would have done that he would have seen
[1:40:50] his wrong now this is uh will come into
[1:40:53] this if ahab had done that or their
[1:40:55] prophets would have done that they would
[1:40:56] have seen themselves wrong a vindicated
[1:40:58] prophet said ahab will die and the dogs
[1:41:00] will lick his blood and his prophecy was
[1:41:02] exactly worth it then he knowed he was
[1:41:04] right even jehoshaphat
[1:41:07] should have seen that and noted when
[1:41:09] mikaya saw the vision he he wasn't much
[1:41:12] with the people in them days but he had
[1:41:13] thus saith the lord he was right see we
[1:41:16] have to this is a segway but
[1:41:19] what you see around you
[1:41:20] is a fulfillment
[1:41:22] of what the prophet told us would happen
[1:41:26] micaiah
[1:41:27] had a had the word of the lord and he
[1:41:30] the word of lord hebrew had was from
[1:41:32] elijah that said that the dogs will look
[1:41:35] jezebel's blood amen is going to look
[1:41:37] ahab's blood and all those things are
[1:41:38] going to happen so he could see that
[1:41:40] this battle that that the kings have
[1:41:42] been drawn out to was actually a
[1:41:44] fulfillment of elijah's prophecy
[1:41:47] amen and this world we see today
[1:41:51] of the prophet's prophecy
[1:41:55] so worried about it
[1:41:57] amen because he also saw the preview of
[1:42:00] the bride
[1:42:01] hallelujah so explore us in preview not
[1:42:04] just the alpha bride in the beginning
[1:42:06] amen but the omega bright at the end
[1:42:08] walking instead amen to the word arrayed
[1:42:11] in his righteousness amen finally
[1:42:14] hallelujah so now
[1:42:16] so what are our lives to be i believe
[1:42:18] i'm part of that number
[1:42:20] right you've got to believe
[1:42:23] right i mean so now if my life if i'm
[1:42:26] part of that number then my life is
[1:42:28] going to fulfill that vision while
[1:42:30] walking in step with the word
[1:42:32] and go up
[1:42:33] hallelujah
[1:42:36] amen so everything's working
[1:42:38] man
[1:42:40] here's a picture that's just the
[1:42:41] pictures this is david
[1:42:43] now and they're taking the ark
[1:42:45] back to well he's going to take it back
[1:42:47] to his city
[1:42:48] and but he has the arc on a new cart who
[1:42:51] knows the story and they're done
[1:42:54] playing music and they're all excited
[1:42:55] and you know david's very excited
[1:42:57] because the word of the art is coming to
[1:42:59] his city and but then there's i think
[1:43:01] it's uh usa or uriah sorry if i get the
[1:43:04] name wrong you know the oxen stumble
[1:43:07] and then he goes to steady the ark and
[1:43:09] god kills him
[1:43:10] and this is the man on the ground here
[1:43:12] maybe david's the one in the red on the
[1:43:13] other side with his hands right he's
[1:43:15] saying oh what's going on sorry
[1:43:17] you know but the thing is see david
[1:43:19] assumed he was doing the right thing
[1:43:22] and though even though he is a man after
[1:43:23] god's own heart and no you know but
[1:43:26] he wasn't doing it according to god's
[1:43:27] word and god is not a respecter of
[1:43:29] persons you know if we go back to the
[1:43:32] story originally where it says that you
[1:43:34] know
[1:43:35] uh micah says to the levite you'll be a
[1:43:37] father and priest to us so our father
[1:43:39] basically now he's in charge right his
[1:43:42] word goes but then it says that micah
[1:43:45] treated this levite as one of his sons
[1:43:48] so now there's a human family pressure
[1:43:50] comes in right to make this levite maybe
[1:43:54] maybe he was shocked when he saw the
[1:43:55] house full of idols at first but then he
[1:43:58] began to reason but you know this guy's
[1:43:59] good to me he feeds me clothes me he
[1:44:01] treats me as one of his family so what
[1:44:03] happens a compromise comes in you know
[1:44:05] we can't compromise
[1:44:08] the scripture we can't compromise the
[1:44:09] message based on any person
[1:44:12] amen
[1:44:13] respective persons is sin
[1:44:16] what their last name is who they are how
[1:44:19] long they've been in the message for
[1:44:22] our human pressure to come in to
[1:44:24] compromise our work
[1:44:29] amen so we're going to stick you know
[1:44:31] we're going to stick with the word oh
[1:44:33] yes amen help us lord jesus amen but
[1:44:35] this your spirit of truth i mean to
[1:44:38] stick you know
[1:44:40] lukewarm if you look at the just webster
[1:44:42] or you know whatever dictionary part of
[1:44:44] that definition of being lukewarm is
[1:44:46] lacking conviction
[1:44:49] we don't want to lack conviction in this
[1:44:51] hour this is an hour where we need
[1:44:53] conviction
[1:44:54] we need real conviction amen we need to
[1:44:56] be convinced and then concerned
[1:44:59] hallelujah that's how we should be amen
[1:45:02] put our faith into action put our
[1:45:03] conviction into action
[1:45:05] amen we've got to stay something so he
[1:45:07] says hey this is wrong this has got to
[1:45:09] be stopped
[1:45:11] yup
[1:45:13] okay now where are we now my brother he
[1:45:15] says don't you miss this now when he
[1:45:17] says that i don't want to miss this and
[1:45:19] my sisters you who want to be woman
[1:45:21] preachers and so forth don't you miss
[1:45:22] this no matter how much your anointing
[1:45:24] is you've got to get in god's provided
[1:45:27] position david's anointing was all right
[1:45:29] but in doing it he got enthused and
[1:45:32] stepped over the boundary line what did
[1:45:34] he do he stepped over the boundary line
[1:45:36] instead of putting the ark in its
[1:45:37] original position he carried it on a new
[1:45:40] cart and not over the hearts of the
[1:45:41] levites it was supposed to be carried on
[1:45:43] the shoulder of the levites which is
[1:45:46] over the heart the word is not defined
[1:45:48] it's in the heart not on a new cart
[1:45:52] i mean
[1:45:54] saying it's not just denominational
[1:45:55] ideas that are a new cat it can just be
[1:45:57] if the word's only in your mind
[1:46:00] a hallelujah that's not how it should be
[1:46:02] it should be in our hearts see what was
[1:46:03] it represented something new david did
[1:46:05] there spoke of every denomination that
[1:46:07] ever be god's word is not to be carried
[1:46:09] by state prep uh presbyters or bishops
[1:46:12] and so forth of denominations it's the
[1:46:14] baptism of the holy ghost in the heart
[1:46:16] of man and not in some ecclesiastical
[1:46:19] move the holy spirit is a treasure of
[1:46:22] god's love in the heart of man and woman
[1:46:24] to obey
[1:46:26] so an order see the word
[1:46:29] the word is not meant to be carried just
[1:46:31] on
[1:46:32] uh phone to push play
[1:46:34] and think i'm listening to the message
[1:46:35] therefore i'm okay no that message is to
[1:46:38] be carried in your heart right this
[1:46:40] message amen it was ordained to be
[1:46:42] carried out
[1:46:44] and you can't of just having it in the
[1:46:46] background somewhere and not making an
[1:46:47] effect in your life
[1:46:49] amen you look you say lord no we have to
[1:46:51] take inventory sometimes it's good to
[1:46:53] take stock right
[1:46:55] and actually be sincere before the lord
[1:46:56] say lord
[1:46:58] is the word i'm hearing
[1:47:00] is it making an effect in my life
[1:47:04] right
[1:47:05] right that's how it should be lord is it
[1:47:08] drawing me closer to you
[1:47:11] or is it taking me down some other trail
[1:47:13] where actually i don't love my brother
[1:47:15] or sister i can't overlook their
[1:47:17] mistakes i mean it's all about me
[1:47:20] right it's all about the past hurts and
[1:47:22] past trouble or you know there's
[1:47:24] something new fat you know
[1:47:26] who cares about fads
[1:47:29] i'll say it like this this vaccine stuff
[1:47:31] is a fan yeah
[1:47:33] hallelujah talk about conspiracy no
[1:47:35] conspiracy don't get caught up on that
[1:47:37] stuff amen
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:41] amen i'm just gonna leave it like that
[1:47:42] but people get so caught up in so many
[1:47:44] different things and the problem is
[1:47:46] there's so many voices in this day what
[1:47:48] voice do we live in you know the voice
[1:47:50] that you're listening to will attract
[1:47:52] your attention to it
[1:47:54] if it's church politics you'll be
[1:47:56] attracted to that amen if it's world
[1:47:59] politics you're attracted to that and
[1:48:01] you'll begin to embody what you're
[1:48:02] attracted to
[1:48:05] amen if you if you're attracted to the
[1:48:07] word of god by the voice of god then
[1:48:10] you'll become the word of god
[1:48:13] amen and that's what we want to be we
[1:48:15] want to be bible living christians right
[1:48:17] we want this message not just to be on
[1:48:20] phones or mp3 or table whatever whatever
[1:48:23] format it is i mean it was never
[1:48:25] intended just to sit there and be talked
[1:48:27] about it was intended that it would come
[1:48:28] into the life i mean by the baptism of
[1:48:30] the holy ghost transform the believer
[1:48:32] into the image of christ i mean to
[1:48:34] manifest the bible
[1:48:36] that's what the message is meant to do
[1:48:37] now i'm going to finish with this he
[1:48:38] says let the power of jesus christ break
[1:48:41] tonight and separate every person in
[1:48:43] here from from any unbelief and that the
[1:48:45] presence of jesus christ the word who
[1:48:47] knows the thoughts of our heart that it
[1:48:49] take pre-eminence tonight in every heart
[1:48:51] and i'll say i mean let the power of god
[1:48:53] break this morning and separate every
[1:48:56] person here from any unbelief so from
[1:48:57] any idols i mean from any past hurts or
[1:49:00] pains or complexes spirits of depression
[1:49:02] or oppression lust or whatever it may be
[1:49:05] unforgiven envy strife anything of the
[1:49:08] world may the power of god break us from
[1:49:10] those things just come into our lives
[1:49:12] and just destroy those shells of those
[1:49:14] idols i mean that those complexes pains
[1:49:16] and hurts they don't have permanence
[1:49:18] over us i mean and also may he break our
[1:49:21] thinking i mean that we don't just cover
[1:49:24] up things because oh we're doing some
[1:49:26] part of the words the lord has to bless
[1:49:28] you
[1:49:29] amen
[1:49:31] reasoning is such an enemy to faith it
[1:49:33] is so much reasoning is such an enemy
[1:49:36] effect amen because if we read
[1:49:39] oh but i have the message in the
[1:49:41] background i have the bible in the
[1:49:42] background i've got quotes and
[1:49:43] scriptures on my you know on my wall so
[1:49:46] therefore you know my lifestyle is fine
[1:49:48] no that's reasoning
[1:49:50] right are we living a life that's
[1:49:52] pleasing to the lord
[1:49:53] amen and if we're not then we should
[1:49:55] pray earnestly lord break these spirits
[1:49:57] out of my life break these titles kill
[1:49:59] it dead lord that women
[1:50:02] right we don't have to live with them
[1:50:04] amen our god
[1:50:06] is very good in the business of
[1:50:08] destroying the works of the devil that's
[1:50:09] why
[1:50:10] it was manifest
[1:50:12] it would destroy the works of the devil
[1:50:14] amen so i pray amen that let the spirit
[1:50:17] of jesus christ enter into your heart i
[1:50:18] mean really receive him and separate you
[1:50:21] amen from any unbelief and let the
[1:50:23] presence of jesus christ the word who
[1:50:25] knows the thoughts of our hearts let it
[1:50:27] have preeminence this morning in every
[1:50:30] heart
[1:50:31] amen
[1:50:32] amen
[1:50:34] amen so let's just bow here to the word
[1:50:36] of prayer i just
[1:50:40] i just want to ask you sincerely

[1:50:54] it really just makes a decision you got
[1:50:56] to make a clear-cut decision lord i
[1:50:59] don't want to hold on to those things
[1:51:00] anymore

[1:51:16] not victims of circumstance
[1:51:18] hallelujah we are only a victim of the
[1:51:21] circumstance of the blood of jesus
[1:51:23] christ
