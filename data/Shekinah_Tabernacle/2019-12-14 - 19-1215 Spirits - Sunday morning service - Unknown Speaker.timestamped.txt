[51:25] after the spirit Lord and we want to
[51:27] walk after the spirit this morning what
[51:29] we want to walk by faith this morning
[51:31] not an anything that we've done or any
[51:32] any achievements or any good things that
[51:34] we've done a little bit we want to enter
[51:36] in by faith in your shed blood this
[51:38] morning Lord that then we could have
[51:40] true fellowship with you Lord and the
[51:42] the way that you would desire us to have
[51:45] fellowship with you Lord so we just want

[52:04] spirit Lord and we just love you with
[52:05] all of our heart this morning in Jesus
[52:07] name Amen amen praise the Lord god bless
[52:10] you all this morning
[52:11] I mean it's a good atmosphere here who's
[52:13] feeling good praise the Lord let some
[52:17] we'll just start this and then oh you
[52:19] can have your seats I've just got one
[52:20] one verse to read here this morning and
[52:22] the verses from James 4:7 can we let's
[52:26] get the the it's going up the air
[52:29] brother Adam and so the verse we're
[52:31] going to read here this morning as James
[52:34] 4:7 and I have got the slide there
[52:38] brother Adam and it's on the oh hey
[52:41] Caleb happy birthday brother Kayla's
[52:45] birthday today there's the thought that
[52:56] I've got this morning that I want to
[52:57] preach on as a thought called spirits
[53:00] spirits and I'm probably not going to
[53:05] say anything that you don't already know
[53:06] but you know if you just say a whole lot
[53:08] of the same thing people it seems to
[53:10] sink in our mind and we just enjoy
[53:11] fellowship around the Word of God James
[53:19] 4:7 says submit yourselves therefore to
[53:21] God resist the devil and he will flee
[53:23] from you amen
[53:25] you can take your seats this morning I
[53:31] enjoy preaching it this fellowship
[53:34] because I know you will you know we're
[53:36] all like friends it's just like we're
[53:37] sitting around having a Bible study so
[53:39] it's nice and relaxed that I get a wee
[53:41] bit nervous when I preach at other
[53:42] churches not that I try and do it too
[53:44] often but you know you see people
[53:45] staring back in you you don't know who
[53:47] they're although there are a few here
[53:50] nothing I know most actually yeah so um
[53:54] and you know you you also you know me
[53:58] well I know you well I know your
[54:00] intention for me as good and you know
[54:02] well I hope you know that my intention
[54:04] for you was good you know and we are all
[54:06] after the same goal which is to a to
[54:09] make it to the other side and be to to
[54:12] grow in Christ as much as we can on in
[54:15] this life and I think your intention
[54:16] towards me as always to help me to
[54:18] achieve that and my intention towards
[54:20] you as always to help you to achieve it
[54:21] and and and I need a lot of grace in
[54:24] order to achieve that because I fail a
[54:26] lot and therefore I think in my mum well
[54:28] you probably do as well maybe some
[54:30] you're better than me but so I afford
[54:33] you a lot of grace you know so it's in
[54:35] that atmosphere that we can grow
[54:36] together and end and end it it's a nice
[54:39] atmosphere to minister on you know
[54:41] because there's grace both ways and we
[54:42] just enjoy the Word of God so now now
[54:47] I've just got to relax here this morning
[54:49] because the way that I kind of think
[54:50] about things as sometimes a wee bit
[54:52] different but but I get there in the end
[54:55] okay so so this might take a little
[54:58] funny journey but I'll get there in the
[54:59] end but it's the way that I understand
[55:03] it and and it's the way that my mind
[55:06] thinks about it and so I just have to
[55:08] talk about it the way that my mind
[55:10] thinks about it and and and not just my
[55:11] mind but as I think about things of God
[55:14] and then I read the scriptures and I
[55:15] read the message and I it all kind of it
[55:18] comes together in here so let's hope I
[55:21] can explain it you know so that it would
[55:24] you understand it not that it's
[55:25] complicated but it's just how that that
[55:28] my mind operates and I just don't like
[55:30] this so that's my little bit so I guess
[55:33] that's my disclaimer okay now we're
[55:36] gonna talk this morning I thought is
[55:37] about spirits and we're going to deal in
[55:40] the unseen realm this morning so this is
[55:43] we're not dealing with things that we
[55:44] can see and actually all of the things
[55:45] of God essentially are or unseen you
[55:48] know because the eternal things have got
[55:49] or unseen but brother Branham said this
[55:51] the unseen world is more real than this
[55:53] world as this world is temporal but the
[55:55] the unseen realm is eternal so that
[55:57] never passes away
[55:58] so we're better off dwelling on the
[56:00] unseen things then the same things you
[56:02] know I want to dwell on things that are
[56:03] eternal okay so now we're gonna we're
[56:06] going to talk about spirits and about
[56:08] the idea of spirits and if you want to
[56:11] give a natural type of a spirit a
[56:13] natural type of a spirit is like a seed
[56:16] okay and spirits essentially spirits the
[56:22] way that they come into this dimension
[56:24] is via a thought that's how they enter
[56:26] and it's the same as a seed in it they
[56:28] they you know people try and paint
[56:30] pictures of these spirits doing funny
[56:31] things in there but they're powerless in
[56:33] that way in a natural way that they have
[56:36] the most power when they can come into
[56:37] the human mind as a thought because
[56:39] that's when they can start to take hold
[56:41] and they can then operate as a thought
[56:43] well thoughts then become actions right
[56:46] but if they can't get somewhere into the
[56:48] first into the human mind as a thought
[56:50] they really are very very powerless so
[56:52] we want to just a stable state that so
[56:53] this is how spirits work they they're
[56:55] not like come and get you a new you know
[56:56] it's not really like that
[56:57] they don't have power and that regard
[56:59] right and it's like a seed you know a
[57:01] seed a seed has to be planted in the
[57:03] ground and then when it's in the ground
[57:04] then it can come whatever is in the seat
[57:06] can come out but if it doesn't have
[57:08] ground to be planted and it's very
[57:09] worthless useless okay and and seeds
[57:14] bring forth of their own kind whatever
[57:15] the Cedars that's what it will bring
[57:17] forth so
[57:19] a Holy Spirit thought will bring forth a
[57:22] holy fruit and an evil spirit will bring
[57:24] forth an evil fruit at some point may
[57:26] now look like it at the start like the
[57:27] tares and the wheat you know but at some
[57:29] point it will bring forth the fruit of
[57:30] whatever it is it will show what its
[57:33] gonna read a verse here to speak about
[57:36] that Matthew 7:15 to 20 beware of false
[57:38] prophets which come to you in sheep's
[57:39] clothing but inwardly they are ravening
[57:41] wolves you shall know them by their
[57:44] fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or
[57:46] figs of thistles even so every good tree
[57:49] bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt
[57:51] tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good
[57:54] tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
[57:55] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[57:57] good fruit every tree that bringeth not
[57:59] forth good fruit is hewn down and cast
[58:01] into the fire wherefore by their fruits
[58:03] you shall know them fruits to clear who
[58:06] we are and we can't hide our fruits and
[58:10] you know that I often if I'm trying to
[58:13] get the right and wrong of something I
[58:14] don't worry so much about what people
[58:15] are saying I just look at the fruits of
[58:16] what's happening and that tells you what
[58:20] it actually is you know by their fruits
[58:21] you shall know them and it's a we we
[58:23] have to judge what is the fruit of
[58:25] something is that what the word are
[58:27] against the word if it's against the
[58:28] word then it been the origin of that
[58:30] seed is from hell that's essentially the
[58:32] basics of it right the origin of that
[58:34] thought there's a there's a spirit
[58:35] behind there that's driving in a
[58:36] different way but at the if the fruits
[58:39] are in line with the Word of God
[58:40] the in the origin of that thought is
[58:42] from the Word of God because the fruit
[58:43] has come forth in that way right but
[58:46] we're going to now just go to the the
[58:49] type of different spirits this is not
[58:50] necessarily a Bible study about spirits
[58:53] I'm gonna go a different path in a
[58:54] little while but it's just to establish
[58:56] this fact there's so and in this room
[59:02] we've got the Holy Spirit which is which
[59:04] is God and spirit form which is Christ
[59:06] the anointing and it's it's able to be
[59:09] divided up and be in all places at a lot
[59:12] of different places at the same time
[59:13] Jesus the natural man could only be here
[59:16] if he was here he couldn't really be
[59:17] over there or he was over here couldn't
[59:19] be there but we can have the same Jesus
[59:22] dwelling in each one of us but in
[59:24] different places all at the same time
[59:25] that's the nature of spirit they can't
[59:27] be it can be divided up and you'd still
[59:29] be the same thing with the Holy Spirit
[59:31] can be
[59:32] that the Devils don't have that same
[59:34] Liberty because they are individual
[59:36] spirits like angels but the holy spirit
[59:40] which is just which is Christ so we've
[59:43] got that Holy Spirit as one component of
[59:47] the unseen realm which is easy and we've
[59:49] also got angels which are spirits and
[59:53] God has got a lot of angels you know we
[59:56] get people's come in and try and so
[59:58] thoughts in our mind well they're just
[59:59] fallen angels so God's got angels that
[1:00:01] are not falling it also also thoughts in
[1:00:04] our mind right that's has to be the way
[1:00:07] that it works because these things are
[1:00:08] still these angels are still there
[1:00:09] Hebrews suit 1 verse 13 to 14 says but
[1:00:12] which of the Angels said he at any time
[1:00:14] sit on my right hand until I make thine
[1:00:17] enemies a footstool
[1:00:18] are they not all ministering spirits
[1:00:20] sent forth to minister for them who
[1:00:22] shall be heirs of salvation me you so so
[1:00:25] these ain't is this aside from the Holy
[1:00:28] Spirit there are angels around that
[1:00:29] minister to us I don't know what time it
[1:00:32] was an angel which time was the Holy
[1:00:33] Spirit but this is what the Bible says
[1:00:35] about it I just got some quotes here
[1:00:37] from brother Branham says when you come
[1:00:39] now people come and just think what if
[1:00:40] you could step over and open up the
[1:00:42] gates of heaven look down in there
[1:00:43] there's people sit right on them same
[1:00:44] benches we use it you see they're the
[1:00:46] same opportunity that you have mothers
[1:00:48] and daughters are weeping fathers and
[1:00:50] mothers holding each other's hands won't
[1:00:51] you come you're invited now Christians
[1:00:53] today we believe that the Holy Spirit's
[1:00:54] going to fall in here in a few minutes
[1:00:56] it's a great isn't this wonderful can't
[1:00:59] you feel their friends day at heaven the
[1:01:00] atmosphere around the people now angels
[1:01:02] of God mingling near I think the Angels
[1:01:05] probably enjoy when people are
[1:01:07] worshiping and they want to come down
[1:01:08] and worship as well see God always had
[1:01:13] ministering spirits I believe in him I
[1:01:15] believe in ministering spirits sent
[1:01:16] forth from the presence of God the Holy
[1:01:18] Spirit ministers lead the church
[1:01:20] guardian angels that watch over us the
[1:01:22] Angels always behold the face of my
[1:01:24] father which is in heaven is that right
[1:01:26] daddy and angels you know we think
[1:01:28] there's some sort of eerie fairy thing
[1:01:29] well the eerie fairy people that doesn't
[1:01:31] belong to them it belongs to us
[1:01:33] angels watching over me brother Branham
[1:01:36] said there's that young children ends
[1:01:38] disabled people have a special angel to
[1:01:40] watch over them
[1:01:46] and wind brother Billy Paul got very
[1:01:49] angry with his little son that kept on
[1:01:51] coming in and he go away brother branham
[1:01:54] said you offended his angel think about
[1:01:57] it now I want you to know that the angel
[1:02:00] of God has no more to do with me that it
[1:02:03] is to do with you then it's an angel
[1:02:05] sent down from heaven and if you don't
[1:02:07] believe angels are ministering and if
[1:02:09] you don't believe angels are ministering
[1:02:10] spirits in from the presence of God then
[1:02:13] you don't know the Bible yes sir I've
[1:02:18] just got a few more of these here some
[1:02:21] time ago a minister told me see brother
[1:02:24] Brown there's no such thing as seeing
[1:02:25] angels angels don't lead the church the
[1:02:27] Holy Ghost leads the church I said
[1:02:29] that's right but we still have angelic
[1:02:31] beings as ministering spirits sent forth
[1:02:33] from the presence of God so so we are as
[1:02:37] much as it's you know we've got the Holy
[1:02:39] Ghost we still have these spirits I've
[1:02:41] got these angels I've got one more the
[1:02:43] doctor said to me not long ago Billy
[1:02:47] don't you think them people the
[1:02:49] impending coastal people is just excited
[1:02:51] brother Andy will like this I said no
[1:02:53] sir I don't
[1:02:55] he said well what makes them that's
[1:02:57] nervous because they scream and holler
[1:02:59] and go on I see a doctor do you mean to
[1:03:01] tell me that the nerves can be excited
[1:03:03] without something to excite him
[1:03:04] something has to excite them so what's
[1:03:06] there I said the unseen force of the
[1:03:09] Holy Ghost moving amongst us it excites
[1:03:11] that born-again spirit right that brings
[1:03:13] an excitement to that spirit the power
[1:03:15] of God foams down through faith comes by
[1:03:17] hearing the Holy Ghost takes the word
[1:03:19] spreads it out over the people to catch
[1:03:21] it with a power that reach indicate
[1:03:23] regenerated born-again life something
[1:03:25] has got to cry out right so saying when
[1:03:27] the Holy Ghost comes down it something
[1:03:30] happens to our spirit and it it's not
[1:03:32] just getting worked up but there was
[1:03:34] genuinely something changing our spirit
[1:03:37] and exciting our spirit okay so now
[1:03:41] we're going to flip over to the other
[1:03:42] side and talk about Satan and and his
[1:03:45] his kingdom because there is another
[1:03:48] kingdom that as opposed to the kingdom
[1:03:50] of God that is fighting against
[1:03:51] everything that God is right now it's on
[1:03:54] that basis that I'm going to
[1:03:57] say that there isn't like a spirit of
[1:04:02] depression or a spirit of anger as such
[1:04:06] right because because these these that
[1:04:09] even though someone may be the priests
[1:04:11] we say well they've got a spirit of
[1:04:12] depression well I don't think there's
[1:04:13] actually a spirit of depression because
[1:04:16] this these angels before they fell they
[1:04:18] weren't depressed angels that they were
[1:04:20] angelic beings worshipping God right and
[1:04:22] that they were a conduit of the the
[1:04:24] things of God when they became when they
[1:04:27] fell they now just become a conduit if
[1:04:29] I've got that here when they fell they
[1:04:32] became a conduit of evil therefore if if
[1:04:37] the word they bring us to bring make you
[1:04:40] depressed then then they're a spirit of
[1:04:41] depression but they they don't always
[1:04:42] stay a spirit of depression you know
[1:04:44] what I mean or like a like a spirit of
[1:04:47] anger you know they are just they are
[1:04:50] just caring because it's a seed right
[1:04:52] though depression starts as a sort in
[1:04:54] our mind your life it's not that good
[1:04:58] for you all these things and whatever it
[1:04:59] might try and make you do and then if
[1:05:01] you take on that thought and it grows
[1:05:03] then it's going to produce whatever
[1:05:04] they're depressed thought is let's say
[1:05:06] you get delivered of that that you cast
[1:05:07] that demon out well that demon make it
[1:05:10] another job to actually dig sky he might
[1:05:12] might try and make him angry so he's
[1:05:13] going to come with a thought of anger
[1:05:14] right and go in there and and sew that
[1:05:17] seed so he's not they're not really I
[1:05:19] don't think they're restricted to one
[1:05:20] particular job otherwise some of these
[1:05:23] guys will be out of a job you know they
[1:05:25] just they change and they go to they
[1:05:27] just they they bring the thoughts of
[1:05:29] Satan to our mind that's what I mean by
[1:05:33] that particular thought however but then
[1:05:39] Jesus did save this one he said when
[1:05:41] Jesus saw that that people came running
[1:05:42] together he rebuked the foul spirit
[1:05:44] saying unto Him they are dumb and deaf
[1:05:45] spirit I charge thee come out of him and
[1:05:47] enter into him no more so he called
[1:05:48] there's particular spirit that this boy
[1:05:51] that was some I think he had but you
[1:05:56] have epilepsy yeah but now Jesus called
[1:06:00] the spirit he had you deaf and dumb
[1:06:01] spirit come out of him and then he was
[1:06:04] delivered I just want to touch on that
[1:06:07] because brother Brennan talks about that
[1:06:09] too
[1:06:10] but it's not really it is a different
[1:06:13] dumb spur but it's just making them
[1:06:14] different um so I'll just read you some
[1:06:15] of these now if you can get the people
[1:06:17] to see that it's a deaf and dumb spirit
[1:06:18] that's a spirit now looky here like I
[1:06:20] explained the other night if something
[1:06:21] was cutting off the circulation in my
[1:06:23] hand there's only one way to ever get
[1:06:25] that out and that is to release it and
[1:06:28] then nature will take care of itself as
[1:06:30] long as that binding comes off well
[1:06:32] that's the way it is when an unseen
[1:06:34] force binds the ears or the tongue or
[1:06:37] some limb of a person
[1:06:38] now you take people that's bound now
[1:06:42] it's hard to tell that person may be a
[1:06:43] Christian right now full of the Holy
[1:06:44] Spirit of God but yet bound I'm gonna
[1:06:51] leave there this the quote is not to do
[1:06:53] with the next bit but he's saying so
[1:06:57] these spirits can can say it may bind
[1:07:00] something somehow and you can't and it
[1:07:03] makes you not be able to hear and
[1:07:04] brother Graham saying that's a spirit
[1:07:05] now if you get rid of that then Nature
[1:07:08] will take his course and the
[1:07:10] whatever-it-was binding will grow back
[1:07:12] together you might think that's simple
[1:07:14] but that's the way brother Branham said
[1:07:16] it and that's what he did and people
[1:07:17] were healed because he said this is what
[1:07:18] it was I'm gonna care to say that but
[1:07:20] okay here's another quote that same
[1:07:24] thing nothing if there's a truth here is
[1:07:27] a person deaf and dumb and there's no
[1:07:28] there's nothing laying dance it'll all
[1:07:30] stop that then what corset now here's
[1:07:33] what it is friends and the light of
[1:07:34] God's word there's an unseen force the
[1:07:36] devil which comes out and himself just
[1:07:38] x-ray won't Sean but it cut off the
[1:07:41] energy it's a supernatural being sitting
[1:07:42] there that's cut off the energy from the
[1:07:44] ear drum now in the way of divine
[1:07:47] healing prayer faith moves us unseen
[1:07:49] force and if nature has its right way
[1:07:50] then their eardrum becomes energized
[1:07:52] again and the patient can hear and Jesus
[1:07:54] said it was a different dumb spirit do
[1:07:56] you believe he was right you believe he
[1:07:57] knew what he was talking about certainly
[1:07:59] he did so so in a sense we call it a
[1:08:02] deaf and dumb spirit but it was just
[1:08:03] something that was holding the ear there
[1:08:07] for okay you can't hear so let's call it
[1:08:09] a dumb spirit but it was just a spirit
[1:08:10] do you understand like if what didn't
[1:08:12] hold the year it would hold the eye and
[1:08:14] would it be a blind spirit if you know
[1:08:15] what I mean okay so yeah so
[1:08:22] I've put pictures up here in the air
[1:08:24] mainly for the children because they if
[1:08:26] I'm going to preach they want to see
[1:08:27] pictures right so that's why a lot of
[1:08:30] these don't need pictures but I've made
[1:08:31] a special effort the berkshires up for
[1:08:33] the children so they can kind of keep
[1:08:34] entertained not that they don't listen
[1:08:36] but when I was a young fellow I used to
[1:08:38] like I'm seeing pictures can I tell you
[1:08:41] something brother and he was going to do
[1:08:43] last week when he preached can I tell
[1:08:46] you I'm just gonna children don't be
[1:08:48] deceived by brother Andy right what he
[1:08:53] was going to do he was preaching last
[1:08:56] week and he was he wanted to make slides
[1:08:58] for the children he was just gonna get a
[1:09:00] whole lot of random photos preachers
[1:09:03] sermon and be cooking through the
[1:09:04] pictures to randomly as he was going
[1:09:05] along at least I put an effort to make
[1:09:09] my pictures relative to what I'm
[1:09:11] preaching about man okay so don't didn't
[1:09:17] win you over he's cheating it's like
[1:09:20] cutting major corners okay we've had to
[1:09:24] get that off my chest I'm just gonna go
[1:09:30] through this like a Bible study okay I'm
[1:09:32] not really going to preach in such but
[1:09:34] maybe I will later on but now let's talk
[1:09:37] about evil now we just touched on this
[1:09:39] earlier but all evil begins there's a
[1:09:41] thought okay that's where it all starts
[1:09:44] it can't start as a tree it has to start
[1:09:46] as a thought okay so a spirit of lust
[1:09:52] right what that is it just starts
[1:09:54] convincing you that you should be
[1:09:56] looking at the wrong thing and then if
[1:09:58] you take that on then that spirit will
[1:10:00] start to grow and that that thought will
[1:10:03] start to grow in your mind and then it
[1:10:05] will bring forth you'll be lusting and
[1:10:07] then you'll do you'll do it we'll just
[1:10:08] the longer you live there it will just
[1:10:10] carry on or all this the other guy this
[1:10:12] the spirit of anger you know it will
[1:10:15] convince you that you should be angry at
[1:10:16] that person because of what he's done
[1:10:18] and then if you act on it that will
[1:10:20] start growing in your mind and these
[1:10:22] these spirits are very rude and
[1:10:25] gentlemanlike spirits they will stay
[1:10:28] there until they're forcibly removed
[1:10:31] they won't say oh you know I've
[1:10:33] tormented you enough I see you're not
[1:10:35] enjoying this I'll go
[1:10:36] this stuff doesn't work like that they
[1:10:38] will not go unless you make them go but
[1:10:41] they will not leave they're not
[1:10:43] gentlemanlike whatsoever and we're going
[1:10:45] to read from James 1:13 to 15 just to
[1:10:48] confirm that it says let no man say when
[1:10:51] he is tempted I am tempted of God for
[1:10:53] God cannot be tempted with evil neither
[1:10:55] tempteth he any man but every man is
[1:10:57] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[1:10:59] lust and enticed then when lust has
[1:11:02] conceived it brings forth sin and sin
[1:11:03] when it is finished brings forth death
[1:11:05] so this is the this is the process of
[1:11:07] how this this stuff works right now I
[1:11:12] want to get into what I actually want to
[1:11:15] talk about in here scheana's gonna
[1:11:17] wonder why I got a picture of her
[1:11:18] milking milking the cow it was just to
[1:11:20] remind me to speak about a story that
[1:11:22] she told me that happened to here and
[1:11:27] I'm not gonna base my doctrine on a on
[1:11:29] something that she told me but on her
[1:11:32] experience or a her testimony
[1:11:33] however the Word of God and a different
[1:11:36] way does match what she said when you
[1:11:38] look into it so when she before she
[1:11:43] moved to New Zealand things were
[1:11:45] happening in her life she wasn't a
[1:11:46] Christian and it's like the Lord was
[1:11:49] guiding her to come to New Zealand to
[1:11:53] eventually meet her when she was on were
[1:11:55] here at a church there but she went
[1:11:59] through a series of I would say
[1:12:00] spiritual experiences outside of knowing
[1:12:03] about God in this journey for maybe
[1:12:05] maybe over the course of six months but
[1:12:07] especially over the course of a few
[1:12:09] months when she was here traveling on
[1:12:10] her own she was doing different
[1:12:14] spiritual things and getting rid of
[1:12:15] different spiritual things that she had
[1:12:17] outside of God and and I don't
[1:12:20] particularly know what this thing was
[1:12:23] that she was dealing with at the time
[1:12:24] but it was some sort of evil thing in
[1:12:26] her life what what she perceived as evil
[1:12:28] and she said she told this thing to go
[1:12:32] she told it just her didn't know God
[1:12:35] told it to go and she said she saw a
[1:12:36] black thing leave her and it left is
[1:12:39] that what happened yeah okay now this is
[1:12:42] not saying I command you to leave in the
[1:12:44] name of Jesus Christ this thing left and
[1:12:46] didn't come back she was
[1:12:49] she was free from whatever this
[1:12:51] particular she knew what it was
[1:12:54] because she knew she wanted it to go she
[1:12:57] knew why it was there I think what was
[1:13:00] it something to do with you my
[1:13:03] grandmother or I when she was a child
[1:13:06] something happened when she was a child
[1:13:07] and she yes so now that seems odd in our
[1:13:10] mind because we think well we know I
[1:13:12] rebuke the spirit in Jesus name and it
[1:13:14] leaves you know we get this idea that
[1:13:16] that's how these we deal with these
[1:13:18] spirits right but that's not that's not
[1:13:24] nice that's not the way that it works it
[1:13:26] doesn't ever have looked into it it
[1:13:29] doesn't actually work like that it's
[1:13:31] there's a different story than that but
[1:13:35] just hold that thought in your mind I'm
[1:13:36] going to come back to that I want to
[1:13:39] let's talk about now casting out wrong
[1:13:41] spirits okay and how how this this
[1:13:44] actually works because this will help us
[1:13:45] in our life to realize that we can
[1:13:47] completely overcome these spirits every
[1:13:49] day of the week all the time they're
[1:13:52] actually very very powerless
[1:13:53] they're very powerless very very
[1:13:56] powerless it surprised me how powerless
[1:13:58] they are it it's it's kind of I've
[1:14:02] thought about it I've looked into it and
[1:14:03] I realize you the only thing they've got
[1:14:05] is all settings God has a bluff and he's
[1:14:07] got these deceptive but that's about all
[1:14:09] he's got going for him
[1:14:10] he's deceptive he will deceive you in a
[1:14:12] certain way buddy but he's got no no
[1:14:15] power at all very he's got no power over
[1:14:18] the human Christian or non-christian
[1:14:20] when you think when you look into it but
[1:14:22] he's he can deceive the non-christian in
[1:14:24] a certain way but the Christian he can't
[1:14:26] deceive but let's just start with us and
[1:14:29] they'll end up back there we're talking
[1:14:31] about casting out wrong spirits mark 3
[1:14:36] 22 to 26 years and the scribes which
[1:14:37] came down from Jerusalem said he hath
[1:14:39] Beelzebub and by the Prince of Devil's
[1:14:41] castle Athiya Devils and it caught on to
[1:14:44] them and said unto them in parables how
[1:14:45] can Satan cast out Satan and if a
[1:14:48] kingdom be divided against itself the
[1:14:50] kingdom cannot stand and if it has to be
[1:14:52] divided against itself that house cannot
[1:14:54] stand and if Satan rise up against
[1:14:56] himself and be divided he cannot stand
[1:14:57] but hath an end okay so so Satan can't
[1:15:02] cast out Satan
[1:15:03] these scribes are saying oh it's by the
[1:15:05] power of Satan you cast out Satan and
[1:15:07] and Jesus said Satan cannot cast himself
[1:15:09] out he will not do that right I'm gonna
[1:15:14] read this one this is a this is a story
[1:15:17] from brother Brennan talking about a
[1:15:22] minister that was that spoke to him and
[1:15:24] he said I thought you said that the
[1:15:25] doctor was a healer there's only one
[1:15:27] hero that's God there's no the devil's
[1:15:31] know he love the devil can't heal at all
[1:15:32] shows mental weakness when you think
[1:15:34] that Jesus said how can Satan cast out
[1:15:36] Satan if he could as kingdom would be
[1:15:38] divided and he couldn't stand he firmly
[1:15:40] said that Satan could not cast that
[1:15:41] Satan see so he can't do that Satan
[1:15:44] can't heal you say well I know a person
[1:15:46] that's got oh yes but people going
[1:15:49] thinking they were going to God and
[1:15:51] doing so get healed so you're saying
[1:15:53] people get go to other places and get
[1:15:54] healed he said yes sir but that was
[1:15:55] their faith the individuals faith in God
[1:15:58] that did that not the witch or the
[1:16:00] soothsayer or whatever they went to or
[1:16:01] the OJ Board or what or what you call
[1:16:04] the devil and that is of the devil
[1:16:06] sentence of the devil fortune tellings
[1:16:08] and with him sends her off the devil
[1:16:09] certainly as anyone knows that who reads
[1:16:13] the Bible so there are healings and
[1:16:16] there are things outside of Christianity
[1:16:19] but Satan didn't do it
[1:16:22] it was it was someone's faith in
[1:16:24] whatever they were doing that caused
[1:16:25] that healing to take place here is a
[1:16:33] story I was going to read this is a
[1:16:36] minister that went to brother bear I'm
[1:16:37] saying that Satan can actually heal and
[1:16:39] he said and let me tell you why I know
[1:16:41] that the devil can heal this is a man
[1:16:43] saying I live in a city with is a woman
[1:16:45] that has a familiar spirit you know one
[1:16:46] of the devil spirits and said people
[1:16:48] come to her for healing and what does
[1:16:51] she do but pull some here out of your
[1:16:53] head pluck some no she pulls here out of
[1:16:55] her here I believe in plucks the veins
[1:16:56] and bleeds it on the hair from her arm
[1:16:58] from the arm and goes down for the river
[1:16:59] behind her house and pushes it over his
[1:17:01] shoulder and she walks up and if she is
[1:17:03] constrained to she has to turn around
[1:17:04] look at it then the disease remains on
[1:17:07] the person that comes back if she
[1:17:08] doesn't see it she tells the people
[1:17:10] they're going to get well she said we've
[1:17:12] kept count of it and said about 20% of
[1:17:14] those are healings
[1:17:16] he said and then you mean to tell me
[1:17:18] that you stand up here and have the
[1:17:19] audacity to say that the devil can't
[1:17:20] heal he's saying because this is what
[1:17:22] this lady does and one out of five
[1:17:24] people get healed that go down there for
[1:17:25] deliverance from this particular
[1:17:26] whatever they've got right not confusing
[1:17:31] at all and it's not confusing they are
[1:17:34] using faith because remember we have we
[1:17:37] are gods we have we have faith and our
[1:17:40] faith if we believe it enough we can
[1:17:43] achieve anything right we can do
[1:17:44] anything so these people had faith at
[1:17:46] all because she turned around I thought
[1:17:47] that if she turned around I would get
[1:17:49] healed now she did so the offer I'm
[1:17:50] going to get here with your faith isn't
[1:17:51] that but they're just tapping into the
[1:17:53] source of faith and I see justice
[1:17:58] straighten you up brother I'd like to
[1:17:59] ask you something I'm surprised that a
[1:18:00] Lutheran team would base his theology
[1:18:01] upon some sort of experience why I said
[1:18:03] and the Baptist Church the first year of
[1:18:06] school we learn to base everything on
[1:18:07] the Bible I said all our theology must
[1:18:09] come off the Bible and you were here
[1:18:10] trying to base your theology on an
[1:18:11] experience this happened therefore this
[1:18:13] is the case well now I said to settle it
[1:18:17] Jesus said Satan can't cast out Satan
[1:18:18] that settles that if Jesus seed Satan
[1:18:21] can't heal then I don't care what you
[1:18:22] know and I would say that settles that
[1:18:23] he can't heal that's all okay so that's
[1:18:29] that's but we know the dynamics behind
[1:18:31] it are that Satan didn't heal the
[1:18:33] person's own faith and believing what
[1:18:36] had happened caused him to be here but
[1:18:37] it's like my friend of mine he was he
[1:18:39] got very sick and they went he was a
[1:18:42] Buddhist and they went to the Buddhist
[1:18:43] monk and they they asked him you know
[1:18:45] why am i sick and that the Buddhist monk
[1:18:48] told him is because you were riding your
[1:18:49] bike down a hill and you ran over one of
[1:18:52] the did priests he was crossing the road
[1:18:53] and you ran over him on your bike
[1:18:55] you ran over a spirit and that's why
[1:18:57] you're sick and he said I didn't I ran
[1:18:59] over a spirit and he he said you must do
[1:19:01] this in this and then you'll get well so
[1:19:03] he did that net then he got well but you
[1:19:05] see he just believed it because he went
[1:19:07] there in faith he believed if I do what
[1:19:10] you say I'll get well but it was his own
[1:19:11] faith that did it it wasn't the priest
[1:19:14] didn't heal this is why you can't
[1:19:16] actually base a true doctrine on healing
[1:19:19] or you can't base a true doctrine on
[1:19:21] casting out of spirits jesus said many
[1:19:23] shall come in my name do you meaning
[1:19:25] wonderful works you know you you you
[1:19:28] can't base
[1:19:29] you can't say with these people right
[1:19:30] because there's a healing there all
[1:19:32] these people right because the spirit
[1:19:33] was cast out because these can be done
[1:19:35] outside of truth you understand outside
[1:19:37] of the word of God okay now what I want
[1:19:40] to get to more so as as this idea here
[1:19:43] this is where this is where it matters
[1:19:45] as Satan can't cast out Satan okay but
[1:19:49] he can convince you to replace one
[1:19:51] spirit with another now I want to base I
[1:19:55] want to tell you that here because of
[1:20:01] the power of choice
[1:20:02] it makes us far more powerful than Satan
[1:20:05] the power of choice right when a thought
[1:20:09] comes you have a choice you have a
[1:20:12] choice do I want to accept that or not
[1:20:17] the only way you can ever accept the
[1:20:20] only way Satan can ever ever have power
[1:20:22] over you as if you accept it if you
[1:20:24] choose to right so when you think about
[1:20:27] it unless you accept that he's got no
[1:20:30] power over you whatsoever he doesn't
[1:20:32] have any any power what power does he
[1:20:35] have outside of that what's he gonna do
[1:20:36] peace do you do all these sorts of
[1:20:38] things but what can you actually do
[1:20:40] outside of if you make a choice No now
[1:20:45] now this is I'm gonna put this out there
[1:20:48] and say this is human beings now all
[1:20:50] right this is not just Christians this
[1:20:52] is human beings human beings are made up
[1:20:54] here Satan's down here he tried to
[1:20:57] deceive you make all these movies and
[1:20:59] make it look like he's a powerful person
[1:21:00] he's able to override the human he can't
[1:21:02] if you choose not to he has absolutely
[1:21:06] no power he's powerless he's powerless
[1:21:09] that and that's why Joshua said here
[1:21:13] choose ye this day whom you will serve
[1:21:16] as for me and my house will serve the
[1:21:18] Lord he's showing we have a choice serve
[1:21:21] that devil serve God serve whoever you
[1:21:23] want it's your choice
[1:21:24] and they can't make you make a choice
[1:21:26] they can try and trick you into making a
[1:21:27] certain choice and convince you but they
[1:21:29] can't forcibly make you make a choice
[1:21:31] right
[1:21:35] and when you get this thought in your
[1:21:37] mind the human being can choose to
[1:21:39] resist the devil because he has made
[1:21:40] more powerful than him now we're not
[1:21:42] talking we're not talking now Christians
[1:21:44] now we're talking humans because we're
[1:21:47] made like gods right we're made up here
[1:21:48] Satan's down here remember this because
[1:21:51] this is now Satan's going to try and
[1:21:52] trick us chemica medicine a roundabout
[1:21:54] way because of this concept there's ways
[1:21:57] to submit yourself therefore to God full
[1:21:59] stop this is another this is another
[1:22:01] half of the verse resist the devil and
[1:22:04] he will flee from you I'm going to say
[1:22:07] that that's not limited to to a
[1:22:09] Christian it's a full stop they resist
[1:22:11] the devil what about some of the gives
[1:22:13] up smoking that's it that's the devil
[1:22:15] you you should smoke you should smoke
[1:22:17] you should smoke get that cigarette that
[1:22:19] so-and-so's got and start smoking yes
[1:22:20] you enjoying this it's good you like
[1:22:21] that you need to have another smoke no
[1:22:22] smoke smoke right there yeah
[1:22:24] at one point that person can say
[1:22:26] actually I don't want to smoke anymore
[1:22:29] right and he can resist that devil and
[1:22:33] if he resisted enough the devil will
[1:22:36] slowly eventually have to go because
[1:22:37] it's like I can't win this as long as
[1:22:38] the human resists he can't win he has to
[1:22:41] be pushed back remember we are like gods
[1:22:43] we've got where were actually a we're
[1:22:45] actually liked you know if we even
[1:22:48] though that's the way that we are so we
[1:22:50] we can actually humans cameras us the
[1:22:52] devil and he will have to flee
[1:22:54] eventually this is not just restricted
[1:22:56] to Christians Genesis 5:1 says this is a
[1:22:59] book of the generations of Adam and the
[1:23:01] day that God created a man and the
[1:23:02] likeness of God created he him Satan's
[1:23:05] not created in the likeness of God we
[1:23:06] are for a man indeed ought not to cover
[1:23:08] his head for as much as he is the image
[1:23:10] and glory of God ok so I want to
[1:23:13] establish that fact we we actually have
[1:23:15] human beings have power over Satan
[1:23:18] don't let them trick you to think you
[1:23:20] don't we hold all the cards here we have
[1:23:23] all the power he doesn't have anything
[1:23:26] no man can serve two masters for either
[1:23:28] he will love the one where I see well he
[1:23:30] will hate the one and love the other or
[1:23:31] else he will hold to the one and despise
[1:23:32] the other you cannot serve God and
[1:23:34] Mammon now we are although we have this
[1:23:36] power we are also made to submit to
[1:23:39] something and we choose what we submit
[1:23:41] to but it's our choice and so if we
[1:23:45] don't want to make the choice for Satan
[1:23:46] then he can't do anything he can't he
[1:23:47] can't forcibly forces what
[1:23:49] on us unless we accept it right now just
[1:23:54] to give you an idea of just how cunning
[1:23:56] this can be though there's this thought
[1:23:58] here right let's have this let's have
[1:24:02] someone that Satan is has maybe they've
[1:24:04] had a bit of a hard life something's
[1:24:06] happened in there they're all down and
[1:24:08] depressed because the Spiritist are that
[1:24:11] they've thought has come into the
[1:24:13] embassy well you're no good you've had
[1:24:14] such a bad run in life because your
[1:24:18] father left when you were a small and
[1:24:20] your mother didn't really like you when
[1:24:21] you went here and did this and no one's
[1:24:23] really ever loved you look when you went
[1:24:24] to kindergarten look at that boy in that
[1:24:26] class picked on you and then you went to
[1:24:28] school and those two people there picked
[1:24:30] on you and you know you're no good and
[1:24:32] you'll never really amount to nothing
[1:24:34] because you never really had any
[1:24:35] opportunity you've never been it had
[1:24:37] access to any like money you know got no
[1:24:40] parents that your foster parents haven't
[1:24:41] got money and all these this the spirit
[1:24:44] can come in and start speaking right and
[1:24:46] and and that person can take that on and
[1:24:49] and this the spirit can be entrenched in
[1:24:51] their life and then a and then if it
[1:24:55] gets entrenched enough they can easily
[1:24:56] have bouts of depression the spirit can
[1:24:58] just easily rule him right by a certain
[1:25:02] thing would happen maybe they might be
[1:25:04] triggered by I don't know they they they
[1:25:08] go to wooden some price some competition
[1:25:12] then they lose some will look there I
[1:25:13] lost because I'm just no good but their
[1:25:15] spirit will say there and they could
[1:25:16] easily get down into this but about
[1:25:19] right but that's just a spirit because
[1:25:21] it all started as a thought right and
[1:25:23] it's coming in now now that person has
[1:25:27] power over that spirit this is now this
[1:25:30] person here is a non-christian person
[1:25:32] we're not we're taking Christianity
[1:25:33] above us that person has power over that
[1:25:36] spirit if they desire to now now let's
[1:25:40] say one day they think I'm so tired of
[1:25:42] being depressed and down I I want to get
[1:25:44] you know I just I don't want to live
[1:25:46] like this anymore no I'm not going to
[1:25:48] think that I'm not going to think that
[1:25:50] they start to resist against it right if
[1:25:54] it's a name to resist they're gonna
[1:25:55] start resisting now that's per it's
[1:25:57] gonna know they're resisting they're
[1:25:58] resisting right
[1:26:00] and and they may try and fight it fight
[1:26:02] it fight it this person's resisting no
[1:26:04] I'm gonna I'm gonna start running and
[1:26:06] exercising because it makes me feel good
[1:26:07] then when it comes on I'm gonna go and
[1:26:09] hang out with friends I'm gonna start
[1:26:10] doing these things to try and resist
[1:26:12] that thought to get rid of this thing
[1:26:15] okay this is called self help and it's
[1:26:18] deadly if it's outside of the word of
[1:26:20] God right deadly I'll show you why he
[1:26:24] starts to he or she is resisting
[1:26:26] resisting now that spirit is going to be
[1:26:29] there realizing I'm actually being
[1:26:30] resisted out of here now he's not going
[1:26:32] to go down without a fight
[1:26:33] right this is the war so now he's going
[1:26:36] to tell whoever over these demons work
[1:26:40] guys I'm being pushed out here I'm being
[1:26:43] pushed out oh you are what's he after
[1:26:47] what does he want oh he wants to he
[1:26:52] wants to be happy he wants to be
[1:26:53] successful Oh does he okay
[1:26:56] that can be arranged right now this
[1:27:02] person is a self-help now this other
[1:27:03] spirit comes in yes actually you can you
[1:27:07] can because you know what no one else
[1:27:09] thought you could but you can you're
[1:27:11] actually very good you're good you can
[1:27:13] you can do it you know you can't achieve
[1:27:18] yes no you're not only you're not
[1:27:19] depressed you're not a loser you're so
[1:27:21] now he let the same dead spirits of
[1:27:24] Satan that's that's going to that's the
[1:27:26] start of pride and I can that's the
[1:27:28] worst spirit a human being can have
[1:27:30] that's the man I'm going to get to there
[1:27:32] that's the most powerful spirit of the
[1:27:33] sages I can and I'm content I'm happy
[1:27:36] now this person can self help his way to
[1:27:39] deliverance from that spirit of
[1:27:41] depression but but now what's it what's
[1:27:44] that spirit being swapped with he's now
[1:27:46] in this other spot where he's now he
[1:27:48] this other spirit has taken hold of him
[1:27:50] I can I'm awesome I'm the best thing
[1:27:52] there is
[1:27:52] I'm great now when he's in that state
[1:27:59] now he's happy I'm satisfied now he's
[1:28:04] got still got a demon he's still got a
[1:28:06] spirit that's enticed him but now he's
[1:28:08] satisfied he's in a worse state now than
[1:28:11] what he wants to start with
[1:28:13] to start with in the other way he was he
[1:28:16] wasn't happy
[1:28:18] the understand where I'm going with us
[1:28:20] the new way he's happy he doesn't want
[1:28:22] deliverance now I want to show you this
[1:28:28] because because this this is what has
[1:28:31] has infiltrated the spirit of
[1:28:34] contentment and I'm happy has
[1:28:36] infiltrated especially Western society
[1:28:38] that's going around the world to where
[1:28:40] people don't need God and it's an it's
[1:28:42] the most evil vicious spirit and when
[1:28:44] you get into that spot that's almost
[1:28:46] impossible to break free from that look
[1:28:47] this guy here when he's depressed
[1:28:49] there's a chance that God could move in
[1:28:50] his life
[1:28:51] because he needs something but but when
[1:28:54] he gets when he gets delivered and this
[1:28:56] other spirit comes down and he's happy
[1:28:57] in this new way because he's the best
[1:28:58] thing yet now I'm achieving things now
[1:29:01] he doesn't need God that's the way it is
[1:29:03] with what these countries that we live
[1:29:05] in they don't need God their spirit is
[1:29:07] so entrenched so powerful there's almost
[1:29:11] no deliverance from it outside of a
[1:29:12] major catastrophic change in someone's
[1:29:14] life there's almost no deliverance when
[1:29:16] people start to be successful I think
[1:29:18] that they've done it they're very very
[1:29:20] hard to break now and I want to show you
[1:29:23] by this this scripture now is showing
[1:29:25] what happened right when the unclean
[1:29:27] spirit has gone out of a man he walketh
[1:29:29] through Dry places seeking rest and
[1:29:30] findeth none he says I will return unto
[1:29:34] my house whence I came and when he
[1:29:35] cometh he find us that swept and
[1:29:37] garnished and then he goeth and take it
[1:29:38] to him seven other spirits more wicked
[1:29:40] than himself and they enter in and dwell
[1:29:41] there and the last state of that man is
[1:29:43] worse than the first now now this is not
[1:29:47] just I for Christian does it this is
[1:29:50] people in this and trying to get
[1:29:52] self-help can actually end up they can
[1:29:54] end up with but that guy is still gonna
[1:29:57] be a little bit depressed now and then
[1:29:58] but he's got all these other spirits now
[1:29:59] that have told him all these other
[1:30:00] things he's in a far worse estate in a
[1:30:02] second estate then what he wasn't is
[1:30:04] first and it's now Satan didn't cast out
[1:30:09] Satan that person in their own because
[1:30:11] they were made like a God resisted the
[1:30:13] other spirit Satan just swapped up with
[1:30:15] another one he swapped that one spirit
[1:30:17] with another spirit and as his next
[1:30:19] state because he didn't swap it with the
[1:30:21] Holy Spirit his nick state is worse so
[1:30:23] as we think we improve in life if we're
[1:30:25] improving
[1:30:26] without the Word of God without the
[1:30:28] Spirit of Christ we're actually getting
[1:30:29] far far far worse and even as nations as
[1:30:32] nations think they're improving and
[1:30:34] they're getting far worse they're
[1:30:35] getting less reachable that's why I say
[1:30:40] the self-help and self-improvement
[1:30:41] without the Word of God as an evil it's
[1:30:43] the most evil powerful spirit that we're
[1:30:46] faced today because if you don't want to
[1:30:48] be free how can you ever be free if
[1:30:51] you're content how can you ever be free
[1:30:54] what Satan wants is to bind us is to
[1:30:58] take us through hell see we think that
[1:31:04] Satan wants to give people a miserable
[1:31:06] life he doesn't he doesn't want to give
[1:31:09] people a miserable life now when I talk
[1:31:12] about the spirit here for a while
[1:31:13] contentment it's one of the most
[1:31:15] powerful contentment without Christ is
[1:31:17] one of the most evil powerful spirits
[1:31:19] that there is Anna sage I'm continuing
[1:31:22] happy and I don't need God now they're
[1:31:25] not against God they're just saying why
[1:31:27] do I need God the Spirit saying you're
[1:31:30] happy life is going good for you you'll
[1:31:32] look you've got a nice car you got this
[1:31:33] you got that you're happy and I'm going
[1:31:35] to say people and this age are generally
[1:31:38] content that we like to paint that the
[1:31:40] everyone's depressed they actually not
[1:31:42] actually reasonably be satisfied most of
[1:31:44] the people I know that on Christians are
[1:31:46] reasonably satisfied I got my job I can
[1:31:49] go out after work I can go meet friends
[1:31:51] at the we can go for coffee we can go do
[1:31:54] this we come home you know I've got my
[1:31:56] nice home I've got my wiki and hobbies I
[1:31:58] do I go fishing I play golf with my
[1:31:59] friends but they're not all it's not all
[1:32:05] bad they content and they will live
[1:32:09] their life continue Satan's happy to
[1:32:10] leave them can't it because when you
[1:32:12] don't win Christ you lose everything so
[1:32:15] if you're in that state you're a bigger
[1:32:17] loser than what we were down in the
[1:32:18] dumps
[1:32:19] you said so don't think because Satan
[1:32:22] doesn't want our life to be he wants to
[1:32:24] actually make it make life nice so that
[1:32:27] we don't desire anything else like this
[1:32:30] you know when you think about it if you
[1:32:34] don't like leadership and a country if
[1:32:36] the leadership in the country is bad
[1:32:38] then they have what they call
[1:32:40] uprising they they change the leadership
[1:32:42] right if there's bad leadership in the
[1:32:45] country the people uprising they changed
[1:32:47] the leadership Satan doesn't want you to
[1:32:49] change the leadership and your life you
[1:32:52] think about it he doesn't want you to
[1:32:53] change he wants to make the leadership
[1:32:56] like you're happy you're content now
[1:32:58] he's not fulfilling your life but he but
[1:33:00] if he can make you not what not make
[1:33:02] make you deliver Christ less life
[1:33:04] content with a crisis life you're
[1:33:08] totally lost not us but you know this is
[1:33:14] why Satan offered Jesus all these things
[1:33:16] you know I'll make you content I'll make
[1:33:19] life easy for you and he will don't
[1:33:22] think that all these guys that have got
[1:33:23] money you're depressed they're not
[1:33:25] they're not a few of them are but as a
[1:33:28] majority I know a lot of them they're
[1:33:29] not that doesn't mean they're for fooled
[1:33:33] it just means they've been convinced
[1:33:36] they're happy I'm not saying go enough
[1:33:37] that life because outside of Christ is
[1:33:38] no life what is it like Jesus here what
[1:33:41] does it profit a man if he gains the
[1:33:42] whole world and lose his soul now Satan
[1:33:45] won't just take it off you at the end
[1:33:46] you've just that you have it right to
[1:33:46] the end what does it matter to him he's
[1:33:48] got the whole lot you keep it long as
[1:33:50] you long as you show that you're happy
[1:33:51] you don't need God you can keep it and
[1:33:53] just preach that yeah hey preach preach
[1:33:56] that you don't need God you see what the
[1:33:58] Spirit is evil evil spirit think about
[1:34:05] this now if we if we flip it around
[1:34:07] right the most stable believer is one
[1:34:11] that realizes that I'm nothing you know
[1:34:13] and he's everything and and that we need
[1:34:19] Christ you know there's a humble spirit
[1:34:21] he's everything we're nothing and and we
[1:34:24] are led by the Holy Ghost in our life
[1:34:26] and that spirit guides us right that's
[1:34:28] the most that's the most stable believer
[1:34:29] in the kingdom of God when someone gets
[1:34:31] to that state like John said I must
[1:34:33] decrease he must increase when you can
[1:34:34] get to be down the bottom where you know
[1:34:37] you're nothing and he's everything and
[1:34:38] it's not a put-on then you're a rock
[1:34:40] solid and you're someone that God can
[1:34:42] use you in no heaven to get up and
[1:34:44] preach from you don't want to you know
[1:34:46] they're gonna force you up there when
[1:34:47] you the other way you want to get up
[1:34:48] there it's odd I want to be here now
[1:34:52] let's flip that around wrote the most
[1:34:54] Satan has his stable people and his
[1:34:57] kingdom - he's got to have his stable
[1:34:59] people the most stable people other
[1:35:01] people that they think they're fantastic
[1:35:02] I'm able but I don't need God they're
[1:35:06] not Satanist they don't think I worship
[1:35:07] Satan that Satan's not he's powerless
[1:35:10] but he's not dumb he doesn't come and
[1:35:13] black and you know it's not how he works
[1:35:15] he's the only the only thing he's got as
[1:35:17] deception as his main tool he's got no
[1:35:20] power over you but he can deceive you
[1:35:21] and me that's what he's got so so the
[1:35:24] people they're the opposite of that the
[1:35:25] thing I'm more sublime great but I don't
[1:35:27] need God these people are pillars in the
[1:35:30] kingdom of Satan
[1:35:31] these people are actors and people that
[1:35:33] get in the show and they appear like
[1:35:35] everything's good and they are generally
[1:35:37] quite happy they're not all depressed
[1:35:39] they're not all down they're generally
[1:35:40] quite happy and they go out and they
[1:35:41] talk on shows and they do this and the
[1:35:43] world watches even thinks well that's
[1:35:44] what I want to be like and it's pure
[1:35:45] convinces them I want to show you this
[1:35:49] here when someone thinks slowly of
[1:35:52] themselves well they've failed in their
[1:35:53] life when they're that way then it's in
[1:35:56] that state that they're going to desire
[1:35:58] a different leadership right when
[1:36:01] everything's going bad for them and it's
[1:36:02] they're down that's when they would
[1:36:04] desire leadership and that's when if you
[1:36:07] have how many testimonies have you heard
[1:36:09] and probably a lot of you guys hear that
[1:36:11] I was at rock bottom and things will go
[1:36:13] and bear me out I thought no one cared
[1:36:14] for me and all these things came on and
[1:36:16] the east and their necks when I turn to
[1:36:17] God God met me right I was on drugs and
[1:36:21] I went there and I things were just
[1:36:23] going bad for me my spirit was broken
[1:36:24] and you know I didn't think much and I
[1:36:26] and God met me
[1:36:27] the majority of testimonies are like
[1:36:29] that okay how many testimonies have you
[1:36:32] heard like this I had everything and
[1:36:34] everything was going well and I was
[1:36:36] happy with my achievements therefore I
[1:36:37] turned to God and disrupted all that and
[1:36:39] now I love worse life then I was happy
[1:36:41] with before you see when you get to a
[1:36:48] certain state you don't need God it's
[1:36:51] the grace of God that gets us to the
[1:36:53] state
[1:36:54] right but if God leaves us and we have
[1:36:58] to all the self-help and especially in
[1:36:59] this age now we the majority of the
[1:37:01] people in these Western countries have
[1:37:02] gotten to this point they don't need God
[1:37:05] they're quite happy without God that's
[1:37:07] that's and this is what the scripture
[1:37:09] here here is about for you see your
[1:37:14] calling brethren how that not many wise
[1:37:15] men after the flesh shall help
[1:37:17] themselves up to I'm on to it I know how
[1:37:20] to run business and I did this and I
[1:37:21] hurted it I'm good at sports I've
[1:37:22] achieved things not many wise men after
[1:37:24] the flesh not many mighty not many noble
[1:37:26] are called why because they've gotten so
[1:37:29] entrenched in the spirit that they they
[1:37:31] they that you can't get them but God has
[1:37:35] chosen the foolish things of the world
[1:37:36] to confound the wise and God hath chosen
[1:37:37] the weak things of the world to confound
[1:37:39] the things which are mighty and basins
[1:37:43] of the world and things which are
[1:37:45] despised hath God chosen yea and things
[1:37:47] which are not to bring to nought things
[1:37:49] that are that no flesh should glory in
[1:37:51] his presence okay this is making sense
[1:37:55] here you right so self-help we've got
[1:38:02] the ability to cast out spirits out of
[1:38:04] our life the human being has a choice
[1:38:06] they can get rid of spirits every day of
[1:38:08] the week but Satan would just replace it
[1:38:13] with a more powerful spirit after
[1:38:14] they're after that till you're so
[1:38:15] entrenched right can I just quickly
[1:38:19] segue real quick I just want to talk
[1:38:21] about a national spirit just to just to
[1:38:22] speak about this I don't call and then I
[1:38:29] want to move on to another another bit
[1:38:32] national spirit now when you think about
[1:38:35] a national spirit that's just a main
[1:38:36] thought that has taken root and a
[1:38:41] majority of the people therefore it
[1:38:43] starts to have more of an effect on the
[1:38:47] people because people that's a lot of
[1:38:52] the times that's a it's a spirit right
[1:38:54] but it's just a certain thought this
[1:38:55] that's growing stronger than other
[1:38:57] thoughts and the in its in terms of
[1:39:00] being a from the kingdom of Satan it's
[1:39:04] an easy catch you can easily catch
[1:39:06] someone then by their national spirit
[1:39:08] because the already immersed and that
[1:39:09] thought from when they small they their
[1:39:11] spirits are familiar spirit right I want
[1:39:16] to say this your satan exploits it satan
[1:39:18] exploits this idea I never got
[1:39:20] significance here but I want to say this
[1:39:21] about South Africa the national spirits
[1:39:25] right it's a in your notice it I don't
[1:39:30] to pick on the woman there but it's like
[1:39:32] they sits like the woman near spend
[1:39:34] about three hours in the bathroom and
[1:39:35] the and the in front of the mirror
[1:39:38] before they go out anywhere right they
[1:39:41] can't even walk outside to I don't know
[1:39:43] hanging the washing out without painting
[1:39:45] themselves right up and and it's a
[1:39:49] spirit it's a national spirit
[1:39:51] it's a prevailing thought that that's
[1:39:53] gone on and now it's such it's so easy
[1:39:55] for Satan now to come into anyone that
[1:39:57] grows up in that country coming in mind
[1:39:58] you can't go it looking like that look
[1:40:00] at all your friends they all look like
[1:40:02] this you can't do that you have to be
[1:40:05] like that before you go out you just
[1:40:06] have to it's outrageous that you
[1:40:08] wouldn't see it's Satan's exploiting
[1:40:11] that national spirit as a result he's
[1:40:14] going to have an easier time to get
[1:40:16] something like that and get them some
[1:40:17] other way so he's just gonna he'll say
[1:40:18] look let's let's not waste our time
[1:40:19] trying to let's just go with what works
[1:40:22] he knows that works it's eat it's an
[1:40:24] easy take so national spirits if you
[1:40:26] don't watch that they're an easy take
[1:40:27] for our mind to just get caught up in a
[1:40:29] national spirit because we're immersed
[1:40:31] in it you know and that thought can
[1:40:32] easily take hold but better Christian
[1:40:34] can actually say no no do you see now we
[1:40:38] discerned that spirit we say no that's
[1:40:43] the segue
[1:40:44] there's the seek that's the word segue I
[1:40:46] didn't know this I don't know but it's
[1:40:48] there's a different word that's a segue
[1:40:51] did you know that no it's a funny word a
[1:40:54] segue it means when you change topic in
[1:40:56] a conversation and that's when you go on
[1:41:00] one of those as for the children
[1:41:06] I want to I want to touch on national
[1:41:11] spirits real quick because this this
[1:41:13] also hasn't this is having that says it
[1:41:15] has an effect on the world you've
[1:41:18] essentially I'm gonna make this general
[1:41:20] but it's not you can't apply this all
[1:41:21] over the anyb situation but however this
[1:41:24] I want to show you how Satan even
[1:41:26] exploits national spirits and exploits
[1:41:28] cultures and ways he just he's deceptive
[1:41:31] he's not powerful but he's deceptive
[1:41:33] right so now the cockpit there are what
[1:41:36] we have conquering nations nations that
[1:41:37] have gone out and done quite well and
[1:41:39] they've conquered other nations kinda
[1:41:41] like in a school you know this guy's in
[1:41:42] the school that hey they're they're the
[1:41:44] winners and there's the other guy said
[1:41:45] nor the other winners you know they're
[1:41:47] losers
[1:41:47] you know kindergarten it's the same way
[1:41:50] and everywhere where we are there's this
[1:41:52] whole class and I'm the top and like a
[1:41:56] peaking order that's the way that's the
[1:41:59] way the world works and the kingdom of
[1:42:01] God the way up is down right so the more
[1:42:03] home will you become the more your
[1:42:05] elevated you know but in the in this
[1:42:07] natural world they just work like this
[1:42:09] then you see you see countries having a
[1:42:11] fascist nothing it's just like a
[1:42:13] schoolyard tussle you know same old
[1:42:14] thing just in a grand scale right but
[1:42:17] you've got conquering nations nations
[1:42:19] that are that have they'd have gone out
[1:42:20] and conquered other nations and they've
[1:42:22] seemed to have been winners so they they
[1:42:24] start to get this idea that you know the
[1:42:27] attitude is you know we're the best team
[1:42:29] and we want to just go and tell everyone
[1:42:30] how great we are you know because
[1:42:31] there's no Satan because they start to
[1:42:34] win Satan their exploits that affect so
[1:42:35] they know winners that's why you've got
[1:42:37] the Western countries this is why
[1:42:38] Western countries are so hard to reach
[1:42:40] with the gospel because we're winners
[1:42:42] we didn't don't need God we're we're all
[1:42:45] winners we're doing so good these other
[1:42:47] countries need us they're out the
[1:42:48] evangelizing to the other countries to
[1:42:50] make them just like them you know be
[1:42:51] winners like us you know right anti God
[1:42:54] you wonder why it can't reach these
[1:42:56] places with the gospel right it's it's
[1:42:59] that but conquered nations are the
[1:43:01] opposite you know this is the Satan will
[1:43:04] exploit a mentality you know you know
[1:43:07] start to say this is if you lose in a
[1:43:09] certain you know if you're a few always
[1:43:11] losing in life you're no good and they
[1:43:13] did you're wrong and you should hate
[1:43:14] them and be miserable and they won't
[1:43:15] even let you get anywhere so you should
[1:43:17] be depressed and spiteful they get this
[1:43:18] whole other
[1:43:20] take on this other spirit that's why a
[1:43:22] lot of these cultures there's a lot of a
[1:43:24] conquered nation doesn't matter the skin
[1:43:27] color it's all around the world they'll
[1:43:29] turn to like almost self-destruction
[1:43:31] just give up well we're just a lot of
[1:43:33] alcoholics there's a lot of society
[1:43:35] itself is not good because it's a spirit
[1:43:38] now I want to reiterate though Satan
[1:43:42] doesn't like people under that condition
[1:43:44] we think he does or he likes people to
[1:43:46] be done no he doesn't he wants people to
[1:43:48] feel like they're winners because if
[1:43:53] you're down like that you're a candidate
[1:43:54] your spirit you can actually come to
[1:43:57] Christ right when you get to the other
[1:43:59] place you self help yourself and to like
[1:44:01] I'm a champion you don't need God Satan
[1:44:04] actually doesn't we think Satan wants
[1:44:05] people to be down he doesn't he wants
[1:44:06] people to be up alright and this is why
[1:44:11] I said this is why I think the spirits
[1:44:12] change Tec depending on where they are
[1:44:13] like I see if they're not a the Spirit
[1:44:15] is not the certain way it just changes
[1:44:16] tech you know if you go to a conquering
[1:44:18] country you don't tell him to be all
[1:44:19] depressed you know you tell them that
[1:44:21] they're awesome they're just enjoy it
[1:44:22] you know but if you go to a if you're if
[1:44:25] he's in a conquered country he's gonna
[1:44:26] tell the opposite you know you'll never
[1:44:27] succeed don't worry about it did it you
[1:44:29] know he'll go that way
[1:44:31] but like I reiterate a Satan would
[1:44:33] rather that they were happy and and feel
[1:44:35] like they were winners because then they
[1:44:36] don't need God because I asked us here
[1:44:38] and this day and age where all the
[1:44:41] revivals happening where where where is
[1:44:44] the Spirit of God moving is it moving in
[1:44:47] these countries where we're the greatest
[1:44:48] very very few one here one there because
[1:44:51] they're so entrenched with these demons
[1:44:52] don't need God countries with a
[1:44:55] different attitude that a better you're
[1:44:58] gonna call them I'm gonna call this
[1:45:00] their your unstable they it's still
[1:45:02] picking which way they go God can move
[1:45:04] this that this is this is why God's
[1:45:06] moving and with this countries with a
[1:45:08] different attitude this is why Satan
[1:45:10] doesn't want them like that so all the
[1:45:11] at the moment you've got this push that
[1:45:13] everyone wants to be like make all these
[1:45:14] countries like the West give them all
[1:45:15] the stuff make them like us it's just
[1:45:17] Satan to to kind of change their
[1:45:19] attitude so that they think well we're
[1:45:20] winners too yeah we don't need any of
[1:45:23] that we can just we're winners that's
[1:45:25] what Satan wants people like that he
[1:45:27] doesn't want people down and depressed
[1:45:28] because they're unstable and they could
[1:45:30] go either way
[1:45:31] sir
[1:45:32] he but down and the press people get
[1:45:35] frustrated with leadership they want
[1:45:38] another leader I don't want to be
[1:45:39] depressed anymore right now now I just
[1:45:44] want to touch on this and then I've got
[1:45:46] a few few things after this now the most
[1:45:50] the the most lost person I could
[1:45:53] actually think of as a Content deceived
[1:45:55] Christian I can't when I think about
[1:45:57] this category I can't think of anybody
[1:45:59] that is more entrenched and more lost
[1:46:02] than this one that that is deceived and
[1:46:06] because now revelations 317 talks about
[1:46:11] this and a this is a spiritual type of
[1:46:13] us also for the world exactly what I was
[1:46:15] talking about but they assess I am rich
[1:46:17] and increased with Goods and have need
[1:46:18] of nothing that's that's that's the
[1:46:21] spirit that's on this world I don't need
[1:46:22] anything
[1:46:23] Christian non-christian I don't need God
[1:46:25] we don't need God why do we need God
[1:46:26] we're heavy have need of nothing an ass
[1:46:29] not that they aren't Richard miserable
[1:46:31] poor blind and naked but we think we
[1:46:34] don't need anything and the deceived
[1:46:37] Christian most of these churches these
[1:46:40] days are just self-help self-help it
[1:46:43] just replaces a depressed demon whether
[1:46:44] the theme and you're awesome and they're
[1:46:47] lucky as the Bible says I've got a
[1:46:49] scripture here they're twofold more a
[1:46:50] child of health and they were to start
[1:46:51] with they were better off being
[1:46:53] depressed and staying in their state and
[1:46:55] maybe having a chance of meeting the
[1:46:56] true God then going and being deceived
[1:46:58] by a church and oh they loved me it was
[1:47:00] it was a great family I got brought in
[1:47:02] and and and they're sowing into you all
[1:47:04] these these these demons Antichrist
[1:47:08] demons which are anti word into your
[1:47:09] life and all that anti word is growing
[1:47:12] in your life but you think it's right
[1:47:13] not you but we think it's right I'm
[1:47:18] gonna read scriptures for such a false
[1:47:23] apostles deceitful workers transforming
[1:47:25] themselves into the apostles of Christ
[1:47:27] and no Marvel for Satan himself is
[1:47:29] transformed into an angel of light he's
[1:47:32] acting like he's light but it's darkness
[1:47:34] that's why this scripture is so powerful
[1:47:37] Jesus says but that's not I be evil thy
[1:47:39] whole body shall be full of darkness if
[1:47:41] therefore the light that has only be
[1:47:43] darkness how great is that darkness
[1:47:45] if you think that you've come to the
[1:47:48] right thing and you've accepted as being
[1:47:50] liked I'm serving God I'm saved I'm
[1:47:53] happy but that's darkness you've been
[1:47:55] then how great is that darkness because
[1:47:57] when you're walking in the light I no
[1:48:00] longer have any desire for light I've
[1:48:02] found the light I'm walking in the light
[1:48:03] I don't need any I'm not searching
[1:48:05] anymore
[1:48:06] I no longer will be searched anymore
[1:48:08] because I found the light and any honest
[1:48:10] darkness that's why Jesus is how great
[1:48:13] is that darkness I can't think of
[1:48:15] anything that's more powerful on a human
[1:48:19] than being in this particular state at
[1:48:21] least that there are non Christian
[1:48:22] thinking they were happy there's a
[1:48:23] chance that their life could go
[1:48:24] topsy-turvy and they could think well
[1:48:25] actually I wasn't happy I need God what
[1:48:31] is impossible for those who were once
[1:48:32] enlightened then have tasted of the
[1:48:33] heavenly gift that were made partakers
[1:48:35] of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the
[1:48:37] good word of God and the powers of the
[1:48:38] world to come if they should fall away
[1:48:39] to renew them again to repentance seeing
[1:48:42] their crucify to themselves the Son of
[1:48:43] God afresh and put them to an open shame
[1:48:46] it's in the state that we can actually
[1:48:49] reject truth and because we go on that
[1:48:54] Christian circles right and that the we
[1:48:56] get a chance the truth comes and we we
[1:48:57] don't want that the genuine the genuine
[1:49:00] Spirit of God the Holy Ghost can
[1:49:01] actually come to to actually meet us and
[1:49:04] we can reject that and then we just go
[1:49:08] this other way and we get we still be
[1:49:10] we're Christian we're still doing these
[1:49:11] things but we're and but there's no hope
[1:49:14] for us after that here's the one of 103
[1:49:17] one to you scribes and Pharisees
[1:49:18] hypocrites for you compare see and then
[1:49:20] to make one proselyte and when he is
[1:49:21] made you make him twofold more the child
[1:49:23] of Hell than yourselves you have self
[1:49:26] helped him and to help
[1:49:27] he's far worse off them than he what he
[1:49:29] was when he when he met you okay now I
[1:49:32] want to get on to this right now on a
[1:49:34] positive note because we're talking
[1:49:38] about getting rid of demons and spirits
[1:49:40] the Spirit of Christ will only associate
[1:49:43] with the true interpretation of his word
[1:49:45] because I won't be so simple as to say
[1:49:47] it's just the word right because if I
[1:49:50] had a this is my Bible here it's on my
[1:49:52] phone but you know it's not so much to
[1:49:54] say the Word of God and just
[1:49:57] hold up the word of god alloh ders true
[1:49:59] but but it's now it's the interpretation
[1:50:01] of the word because people can read the
[1:50:03] same word and there's oh no that means
[1:50:05] us that means that no it doesn't mean
[1:50:06] this it means that it's that doesn't
[1:50:08] matter here there and interpret it all
[1:50:09] the way so it's not so much the the word
[1:50:11] itself that God associates with it's the
[1:50:14] interpretation of that word right that's
[1:50:19] why see not just the Bible but the true
[1:50:21] interpretation of that word and we
[1:50:22] believe in this day that brother Branham
[1:50:24] came as the messenger of Malachi 4 to
[1:50:26] bring the true interpretation of the
[1:50:28] Word of God right now now God's Spirit
[1:50:32] will associate with that so now now when
[1:50:40] it comes now to us
[1:50:41] now we're talking about deliverance now
[1:50:43] right any any evil spirit in our life
[1:50:45] whatsoever we're gonna stalk up in our
[1:50:47] casting them out you get far worse offer
[1:50:51] for a few just get rid of one spirit and
[1:50:53] another spirit replaces it like that
[1:50:56] happens and people get so entrenched but
[1:50:57] now we have the ability when we
[1:51:00] surrender to Christ and we come under
[1:51:03] his word the true interpretation of his
[1:51:04] word we have the ability God has given
[1:51:08] us the ability to remove one spirit
[1:51:10] resist it and to replace that spirit
[1:51:13] with the Holy Spirit with his word so
[1:51:18] that the right spirit can actually
[1:51:21] inhabit that land that that wrong spirit
[1:51:23] was we don't hit and the light that's in
[1:51:26] us is light not darkness because if you
[1:51:29] didn't have the true interpretation you
[1:51:30] could go along and be replacing that
[1:51:33] wrong spirit with an even worse the
[1:51:34] spirit thinking that's right do you not
[1:51:36] I mean so that's why I say this here
[1:51:38] when you think about grace when you
[1:51:41] think about grace how much more grace
[1:51:44] could you receive then an option to
[1:51:47] possess by his Spirit in your life you
[1:51:52] understand what I mean by that like the
[1:51:55] the option that we have that we can
[1:51:57] actually that we can remove one spirit
[1:52:00] but we know the spirit this word is
[1:52:03] going to replace their intake resonance
[1:52:05] in my life because if we didn't know
[1:52:09] that that's what that was then how could
[1:52:11] we have it in
[1:52:12] how could our life become overcome by
[1:52:13] the Spirit of God it wouldn't be able to
[1:52:17] does that make you understand it right
[1:52:20] I'm gonna talk about this for a second
[1:52:23] then I'm done in about ten minutes right
[1:52:28] let's now forget about all those other
[1:52:30] things it's taken now from a Christian a
[1:52:32] Christian perspective in our life
[1:52:36] because we all we all our land we're
[1:52:41] going to talk about our land now our
[1:52:43] land was full of just wrong evil spirits
[1:52:47] right mine was full yours was full they
[1:52:50] just they just come in they just did
[1:52:52] their thing right but we have the
[1:52:55] ability to now to perceive those to
[1:53:03] resist those and to replace that spirit
[1:53:05] with the Spirit of God every single
[1:53:08] wrong spirit that's in our life which
[1:53:09] has thoughts and all these things we
[1:53:11] have the ability now to to possess every
[1:53:14] area every single area in our life no
[1:53:18] area goes untouched
[1:53:19] every single area we've got every means
[1:53:23] we've got we've got the understanding
[1:53:25] that we have all the power and then
[1:53:26] we've got that the the true
[1:53:28] interpretation of the word of God in
[1:53:29] that situation to get rid of whatever
[1:53:31] wrong spirit thought that it was and
[1:53:32] replace it with the right one and we can
[1:53:35] go through spirit my spirit battle by
[1:53:38] battle and overcome every single thing
[1:53:41] this is not oh if you do this if you do
[1:53:43] that this is just this is what we do
[1:53:44] this is not this is not it might work
[1:53:47] for you it might not know this will work
[1:53:48] for everybody this is what what we have
[1:53:51] there's no I may not work no it does
[1:53:54] work there's no we can't conquer it all
[1:53:57] you can conquer it all all of those
[1:54:00] negative thoughts that just Satan
[1:54:01] telling you you can't he knows you can
[1:54:03] he knows that if and as God leads you as
[1:54:06] you perceive it you can actually say
[1:54:08] well that's a that there's a wrong
[1:54:10] spirit that's a wrong thought you can
[1:54:12] start to resist that and God can show
[1:54:14] you what the right thought is and
[1:54:16] there's a battle going on but you're one
[1:54:18] the Bible says if you resist that you
[1:54:20] can just resist resist resist resist it
[1:54:22] will just and you can it will flee and
[1:54:24] and that right
[1:54:25] spurt that right thought would just come
[1:54:27] in and take residence there and there
[1:54:29] was no enemy anywhere that will that
[1:54:32] could ever resist that if you wanted to
[1:54:37] and that this that's how it works we
[1:54:40] don't we're not we're not defeated we're
[1:54:43] not powerless we're very very powerful
[1:54:45] and now that we've got the
[1:54:46] interpretation of the true Word of God
[1:54:48] we can replace these first with the Holy
[1:54:49] Spirit exactly the right thing and it's
[1:54:52] legible by illegible this is how the
[1:54:54] stuff works it's little by little Jesus
[1:54:56] is here I'll see my fear before the end
[1:54:58] will destroy the people to whom they
[1:54:59] shall come and I'll make all thine
[1:55:01] enemies turn their backs unto thee and
[1:55:03] I'll send Hornets before they which
[1:55:04] he'll drive at the hittite the K night
[1:55:05] or the hippo at the K night and the
[1:55:07] Hittite from before thee I will not
[1:55:09] drive them out from before the in one
[1:55:10] year less the lamb become desolate and
[1:55:12] the beasts of the field multiply against
[1:55:13] thee while little and little I would
[1:55:15] drive them out from before the until
[1:55:16] their be increased in here at the land
[1:55:19] it's just gonna be one thing at a time
[1:55:21] God's gonna defeat them but I know I'm
[1:55:31] goin again I just want to take this slow
[1:55:35] right I've got about 10 more minutes but
[1:55:36] I want to take the slow so that so that
[1:55:38] we and just bear with me for another 10
[1:55:40] minutes right because when we perceive
[1:55:44] how easy this is then it just Satan
[1:55:49] loses his power when we realize this is
[1:55:50] actually very very easy he's made it
[1:55:53] seem like it's so hard it's not it's not
[1:55:57] it's not hard it's easy right now I'm
[1:56:02] not saying that all you just had it easy
[1:56:03] now I haven't had it easy
[1:56:04] I've just perceived Satan as very once
[1:56:08] you resist him he just he the more you
[1:56:10] resist him the more he loses his power
[1:56:12] and he just been eventually he flees but
[1:56:16] you see what these things I want to put
[1:56:18] it this way that the Lord doesn't
[1:56:20] possess he doesn't just walk forward and
[1:56:22] take it and go or he go take that ground
[1:56:24] here that I've just possessed right
[1:56:25] that's not how this thing works so we
[1:56:28] possess by making a choice by perceiving
[1:56:31] okay their thoughts wrong that spirits
[1:56:33] wrong I don't and by a revelation we
[1:56:37] think this thought is right
[1:56:39] therefore I'm going to move forward with
[1:56:40] this thought into that situation right
[1:56:44] but but but God won't take that thought
[1:56:46] and walk in and get the devil to flee
[1:56:48] and then where you go oh well this is
[1:56:49] great this is so easy and we walk into
[1:56:51] it
[1:56:51] do you understand we possess because we
[1:56:55] like God's - right but we walk forward
[1:56:58] you say well that's man doing it well no
[1:56:59] it's not because because we are
[1:57:01] possessing with the Word of God because
[1:57:04] we're carrying it so we we then move
[1:57:05] forward and we resist that thing but
[1:57:07] what's with us is the Word of God the
[1:57:09] true interpretation of the word not not
[1:57:11] and so then we possess it and in it's
[1:57:14] ours and as as simple as that
[1:57:18] and and if we see we can kick out any
[1:57:21] demon out of our life anywhere any time
[1:57:22] that we want to the human being can buts
[1:57:26] the grace of God that has allowed us to
[1:57:28] have true revelation to actually not
[1:57:30] just kick that demon out another one
[1:57:32] replace replace with some other evil
[1:57:34] thing but replace it with the true Word
[1:57:36] of God and we're there you know and we
[1:57:39] and we can and it's as easy as just
[1:57:41] walking forward just when you see it we
[1:57:45] need to be warriors you know we need to
[1:57:46] be excited about a fight say well
[1:57:47] there's another fight yes we need it get
[1:57:51] the idea that we want us now I know I'm
[1:57:53] contradicting myself from what I said
[1:57:55] before but you know in Christ I can do
[1:57:56] all things through Christ who
[1:57:57] strengtheneth me right I'm gonna flick
[1:58:02] forward out of these ones don't limit
[1:58:07] how powerful that you are and the end
[1:58:10] and take advantage of what we have been
[1:58:13] given now I just want to point out to
[1:58:17] you though how this stuff works because
[1:58:18] sometimes we can get a bit down when
[1:58:20] things don't sort of change the way that
[1:58:21] we think they should right I'm going to
[1:58:23] use this as an example of a wrong
[1:58:27] thought let's say let's say for
[1:58:31] argument's sake you always had this
[1:58:32] whenever someone doesn't see me - you
[1:58:34] got real upset you know you got upset
[1:58:38] right minutes and you felt I'm gonna say
[1:58:41] you felt hatred because if you just boil
[1:58:43] a little down in fetters hatred you felt
[1:58:46] hatred against him but we wouldn't say
[1:58:47] it was hatred I don't hate him I just
[1:58:49] was upset with him
[1:58:50] but if we boil it down or if you let
[1:58:53] that thing take hold
[1:58:55] that's hatred right so now but because
[1:59:01] at some point there's otters come on and
[1:59:04] see it you know when they do that to you
[1:59:05] it's okay to do that back to them and
[1:59:06] feel that way against them that's
[1:59:08] alright and it and before you knew
[1:59:09] bitter you let their thought come and
[1:59:12] you thought yeah that's how you operate
[1:59:13] when someone does that to you you just
[1:59:15] hate them right that's no that's how
[1:59:18] your mind started to work and I'm gonna
[1:59:20] put this old house here like because
[1:59:23] that's how you're used to always
[1:59:24] operating that thought kind of takes up
[1:59:28] residence in your life in it it just
[1:59:31] looks like this right and you're
[1:59:33] whenever that situation happens it's
[1:59:35] just your natural way that you would do
[1:59:38] things as just hate them they did that
[1:59:40] no I hate them not happy with him that's
[1:59:43] how you are naturally doing the
[1:59:45] situation right and and I'm gonna say
[1:59:48] hatred looks like this run down it's an
[1:59:50] it evil anywhere where Satan resides in
[1:59:52] your life though is not majestic he
[1:59:56] doesn't have the ability to make things
[1:59:57] majestic it's all just run down and you
[2:00:00] know tries to make you think you happy
[2:00:02] about it but it does look like this it's
[2:00:04] run down right now
[2:00:05] now you may you may be in perceive this
[2:00:08] and think man I shouldn't have thought
[2:00:09] that about brother so-and-so I shouldn't
[2:00:11] have thought that about this person that
[2:00:12] was stopping in front of me of the
[2:00:14] lights and wouldn't go when the light
[2:00:15] being green and he I waited three
[2:00:16] seconds you know I shouldn't have
[2:00:19] thought that I got so angry right and
[2:00:22] and you know you know you've noticed
[2:00:24] thing okay that's the wrong there's
[2:00:26] something there's a wrong spirit here in
[2:00:28] my life
[2:00:29] now you're saved this is not your
[2:00:31] salvation you're saved right but there's
[2:00:32] a wrong spirit there and you think okay
[2:00:36] what would be the right spirit to have
[2:00:38] now so that's a word right because a
[2:00:40] spirit is just that and you look in the
[2:00:42] Word of God maybe you know um you'll
[2:00:45] think of scriptures love learn enemy or
[2:00:46] you'll think of different ones like you
[2:00:48] know if you hate your brother without a
[2:00:49] cause or you'll you'll think of
[2:00:50] different ones you'll think okay the
[2:00:51] right attitude is not to the right
[2:00:53] thought is to will be patient whatever
[2:00:56] they whatever you think it might be in
[2:00:57] that situation you see you say okay well
[2:00:59] that's the one I'm going to apply to the
[2:01:00] situation then right and then you and
[2:01:02] then now you've got a battle on you
[2:01:04] hands right and you'll say okay now
[2:01:06] because this is how this is what we do
[2:01:07] every day of the week and we wouldn't
[2:01:09] when when when when right and then you
[2:01:13] then resist that other thought you say
[2:01:15] no I'm not going to think that
[2:01:17] and so you resist it and now I'm gonna
[2:01:20] say let's just put it like this right
[2:01:23] you could resist that thought and then
[2:01:25] instance and go right you're gone I'm
[2:01:26] not gonna thank you anymore I'm not
[2:01:28] gonna think like that anymore I don't
[2:01:29] want to think like that I want to think
[2:01:30] about this now you can probably just
[2:01:32] kick that demon out there and then right
[2:01:35] okay but I want to show you what happens
[2:01:39] in their instance of time because now
[2:01:40] we're humans your picture looks like
[2:01:42] this so you see so so this guy here is
[2:01:47] the spirit but this is sort of the
[2:01:48] effects he's had on your life which are
[2:01:49] all your emotions and the way you work
[2:01:51] and everything because he's been here
[2:01:53] he's sort of taken up residence and has
[2:01:55] and had an effect on how you operate as
[2:01:57] a human but but he was only there but
[2:02:00] he's just made this here right so now
[2:02:03] when you kick him out and the sick money
[2:02:07] is actually gone and yet when the next
[2:02:10] guy doesn't go after three seconds like
[2:02:12] the lights you know you want to know
[2:02:14] what's gonna happen you're gonna get
[2:02:15] upset because because that's how you've
[2:02:19] because the effects of him being there
[2:02:21] for so long is still there that doesn't
[2:02:23] mean he's back it just means he's you
[2:02:26] know so don't get people say oh I was
[2:02:29] delivered here then a couple of weeks
[2:02:30] later it came back and now no you're
[2:02:32] always delivered don't think like that
[2:02:36] because what happens is just like it
[2:02:40] took this guy time to ruin it it takes
[2:02:42] God time to rebuild something and to get
[2:02:44] a new a new way that we think about it
[2:02:46] to get a new way of operating it takes
[2:02:48] God it takes our mind time to get to
[2:02:50] that point you see it doesn't happen
[2:02:53] just overnight like and when we think it
[2:02:55] happens overnight
[2:02:56] I'm delivered now therefore I'm never
[2:02:57] going to get angry again then we're
[2:02:59] going to get upset when it doesn't
[2:03:00] happen that way
[2:03:02] because that's not how this thing works
[2:03:04] this works like but because we have let
[2:03:06] the Spirit of God come and replace that
[2:03:08] thought with the right thought that's
[2:03:09] going to take residence it may take a
[2:03:11] month to three but that spirit while
[2:03:14] residing here is going to change the way
[2:03:15] that everything works
[2:03:17] it may take six months right and I have
[2:03:22] one over there okay but eventually God
[2:03:29] has got you it's going to become natural
[2:03:31] when it the next time it happens it's
[2:03:32] going to be a strain it's gonna feel
[2:03:34] like this is I'm unusually trying don't
[2:03:36] be angry don't be angry because your
[2:03:38] whole mind is used to being angry don't
[2:03:41] be angry just and it's unnatural I'm
[2:03:43] gonna say it's gonna be there you know
[2:03:46] you're gonna be it's gonna be unnatural
[2:03:47] because your whole being is angry but
[2:03:49] you're saying I'm not angry it's not
[2:03:50] really natural you know
[2:03:52] awkward that's what it's going to be
[2:03:54] like but but keep pressing on keep
[2:03:58] pressing on because this stuff this
[2:04:00] stuff if you press on keep resisting and
[2:04:04] the Spirit of God is there neat starts
[2:04:07] making his residence it will eventually
[2:04:08] go like this till six months down the
[2:04:11] track it will happen and you'll be
[2:04:13] halfway up the road again you think man
[2:04:15] I didn't even blink when that guy took
[2:04:17] five minutes to leave from the light you
[2:04:22] know it will become natural because that
[2:04:26] word of God has taken root in your life
[2:04:29] in that area and it's bringing forth the
[2:04:32] fruit of whatever that word is and a
[2:04:34] tenet because it's taken root and it's
[2:04:36] had a chance to have an effect on your
[2:04:38] life maybe six months maybe a year the
[2:04:41] in Venice now it's things become natural
[2:04:44] so it's me the to live a Christian life
[2:04:46] eventually in all areas if your life
[2:04:48] becomes natural it's it's actually
[2:04:50] abnormal to go back the other way you
[2:04:52] know it's it's not it's not in here so
[2:04:58] that's this that's what I had this
[2:05:01] morning that was my thought this morning
[2:05:04] and and my main thing that I want you to
[2:05:10] realize is just how powerful that you
[2:05:12] are and that that if you choose to
[2:05:15] resist you can just resist and and you
[2:05:19] can don't look at your land and think
[2:05:22] all these things that will never be
[2:05:23] overtaken you know we can think that in
[2:05:25] our mind sometimes just think know
[2:05:27] everything Kimmy the Word of God is
[2:05:30] going to overtake
[2:05:30] single area it's not somewhere far
[2:05:32] office not like I know it's just all the
[2:05:35] time battle after battle you're just
[2:05:37] gonna want everything and your whole
[2:05:39] land is going to be possessed by the
[2:05:41] spirit of god and it's going to be
[2:05:42] natural you're just going to literally
[2:05:44] just live a natural Christian life
[2:05:46] without he's going to have full
[2:05:47] residence Satan will Bluff you - think
[2:05:50] you can - no it's higher than that but
[2:05:51] that's all he's got as deception and to
[2:05:53] make you think that you can't it that's
[2:05:55] all he has but a few so desire to move
[2:05:57] forward then you can let some let some
[2:06:01] stand this morning I'll get their
[2:06:02] musicians to come so we have that song
[2:06:14] um I think it's in C we are able to go
