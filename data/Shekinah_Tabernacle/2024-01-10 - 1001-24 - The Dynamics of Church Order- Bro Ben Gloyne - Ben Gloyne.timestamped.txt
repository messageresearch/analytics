[22:57] second
[22:59] Corinthians 3: 5 and
[23:05] 6 it says here not that we are
[23:08] sufficient of ourselves to think
[23:09] anything as of ourselves but our
[23:12] sufficiency is of God who Alo who also
[23:16] hath made us able Ministers of the New
[23:19] Testament not of the letter but of the
[23:22] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[23:24] giveth life amen amen was going to go
[23:27] read
[23:28] Genesis 1 just read verses 1 to 4 I'm
[23:31] going to read about I'm going to speak
[23:33] about rather the the the Dynamics of
[23:35] church order tonight wow so this is kind
[23:37] of you see while we're going to Genesis
[23:39] well we you'll see amen says in the
[23:42] beginning God created the heavens and
[23:44] the Earth and the Earth was with was
[23:46] without form and void and darkness was
[23:48] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[23:50] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[23:53] and God said let there be light and
[23:55] there was light and God saw the light
[23:58] that it was good and God divided the
[24:00] light from the darkness amen let's just
[24:03] bow our heads in a word of prayer
[24:04] tonight gracious father we're so
[24:07] thankful that we can place Our Hope in

[24:56] God and we commit them into your hands
[24:58] and anyone else who's away we thank you
[25:00] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[25:02] bless you friends you can have your
[25:03] seats tonight so I want to talk about
[25:05] the Dynamics of church order just for a
[25:07] few moments see many people will uh you
[25:10] know I've heard sermons on Church order
[25:12] and why you know uh you know just
[25:15] basically going over what brother Bram
[25:16] said how church service should be and
[25:18] all those things but I was thinking well
[25:20] but but there's a reason behind it you
[25:21] know you know there's a there's a
[25:23] dynamics of the Holy Ghost in church
[25:25] order you know it's more than just
[25:26] laying out things on this is a law this
[25:28] is how things should be but there's but
[25:29] there's a purpose behind it and and now
[25:32] we we know that church is really like uh
[25:35] well the preaching of the Gospel is just
[25:37] like in Genesis 1 where where we were
[25:39] like the Earth before the Lord found us
[25:41] we were in darkness you know we were
[25:43] without form and void and darkness
[25:45] covered the face of our deep and you
[25:47] know but but there was life in there
[25:49] because if you keep reading down I don't
[25:50] have the scripture uh there but you know
[25:53] keep reading down that when God uh
[25:54] brought forth botony life the seeds were
[25:56] already in the Earth it never said he
[25:58] created them they were already there and
[26:00] just like a True Believer has a gene
[26:02] seed of God on the inside of the inside
[26:04] of them but it takes the light of God
[26:07] the manifestation of the spoken word am
[26:09] mean the word of our day to to to shine
[26:12] upon us and and and as soon as God
[26:15] begins to do that he begins to separate
[26:17] light from darkness that the life that's
[26:19] within us comes forth just like the life
[26:21] that was in the earth God kept brooding
[26:23] over it until finally that life came
[26:25] forth and man was here and amen so so
[26:28] this is what really church is to do to
[26:30] bring seeds to life amen to to cast out
[26:32] Darkness off of people's lives that you
[26:35] know the light of God's word would shine
[26:37] and bring forth amen so so this is the P
[26:40] purpose of church this is the the
[26:42] Dynamics of uh Church order now we know
[26:46] that our sufficiency is of God so we're
[26:48] here to to preach by the spirit of God
[26:52] the spirit giveth life it's not the
[26:54] letter it's not the dead letter of the
[26:56] law it's the spirit behind the word that
[26:59] gives life and that's what we want to
[27:00] Major on I think is the spirit of the
[27:03] word amen not just the not just the
[27:05] What's called the dos and don'ts but but
[27:06] what's the purpose what's the Dynamics
[27:08] behind those things you know because if
[27:10] we can really I believe if we can really
[27:12] grasp the Dynamics of church order why
[27:15] brother bandam laid out certain things
[27:16] the way he did I believe we would
[27:18] embrace it like never before and I
[27:20] believe we would see the power of God
[27:22] and a far greater manifestation amen so
[27:26] so I pray that we can just just enter in
[27:28] tonight amen we can see you know sure we
[27:31] say well we're going to church it's a
[27:32] wed day Wednesday or a Sunday but I pray
[27:35] wouldd really enter into church like
[27:36] never before especially this could be
[27:37] the last year we're here so why not in
[27:40] in end on a bang you know end on a high
[27:42] you know so why not so Hallelujah now
[27:45] brother B would say one of the doctors
[27:47] said well I tell you I find this that
[27:49] the greatest power in the world is not
[27:50] the atomic bomb but a believer in
[27:53] contact with his maker it changes the
[27:55] whole attitude changes his mental
[27:57] changes his habit changes his body it
[27:59] changes his nature everything am mean so
[28:02] the greatest power on the earth is a
[28:04] believer in contact with his maker I
[28:07] mean so so that's the purpose of church
[28:08] that's why we gather is that we would
[28:10] come in contact with the Living God now
[28:12] we know it's an individual walk with God
[28:14] you can meet God in your car at home you
[28:16] can meet God anywhere but you know
[28:18] there's something very powerful when the
[28:19] body of Christ comes together or the
[28:21] gifts of the body come together you know
[28:23] we come into Harmony One Accord one
[28:25] heart one mind one Accord that God would
[28:28] come down in a far greater way than he
[28:30] could just by ourselves yeah amen that's
[28:33] right I know this is this is probably
[28:35] nothing new to anyone but hey here we
[28:37] are um you know uh so God would tell
[28:41] Moses uh he says and let them make me a
[28:43] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[28:45] see that was the purpose of the law that
[28:47] was the purpose of of of of all the
[28:49] levitical code and everything that God
[28:51] would dwell among his people that was
[28:53] the purpose of it that was the Dynamics
[28:54] of it and you think about it if you're
[28:56] an Israelite back in those days you
[28:58] think you know you think what's the
[28:59] purpose of all this and all the badger
[29:01] skins and the Tabernacle and all these
[29:02] things it'll come down to one thing
[29:04] Jehovah God wants to dwell Among Us he
[29:07] doesn't want to be just above us or
[29:08] somewhere away he wants to walk among
[29:10] his people he wants to be with us and
[29:12] that's what God wants to be not just
[29:13] with us in US amen because the Bible
[29:15] says he's Christ in you the hope of
[29:17] glory so now this all boils down to the
[29:20] heart okay all of this boils down to the
[29:21] heart of the worshipper it's really you
[29:23] know like even even with the you know
[29:25] Moses and the people building The
[29:26] Sanctuary that would have really been
[29:28] the heart of the Builder would have been
[29:29] the most important thing not their skill
[29:31] not how smart they were but but their
[29:34] sincere genuine Hearts I believe would
[29:36] make all the difference it's like
[29:37] Solomon how how you know Solomon was
[29:40] instructed you know Solomon built the
[29:42] Lord a house and we know that God
[29:43] doesn't dwell in temples made with hands
[29:46] you know as say the prophet he says
[29:47] Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot
[29:49] stol what house will you build me say
[29:51] the Lord or what is the place of my rest
[29:53] now man can't build a t Temple for God
[29:57] yeah right like this church is just a
[29:58] meeting place it's a place dedicated to
[30:00] God God doesn't literally dwell in this
[30:03] building because we've called it a
[30:04] church no God dwells in you and I he we
[30:06] are the living Tabernacle of the Living
[30:08] God Amen we are Lively Stone so when I'm
[30:11] talking about this house of worship or
[30:12] the Dynamics of church order that should
[30:14] be the holy ghost moving in your life
[30:16] that is the Dynamics of church order now
[30:19] you see when Solomon dedicated the
[30:22] temple it would have all been in vain if
[30:25] the Shak kind of Glory didn't come into
[30:26] the hly of holies it would have been all
[30:29] in vain if the presence of God didn't
[30:30] come down and accept their sacrifice it
[30:33] would have meant nothing all of the
[30:34] building all the trumpets all of the you
[30:37] know this is probably not the best but
[30:38] but you see all the playing all the
[30:40] sacrifices Solomon's Prayer everything
[30:43] would have been in vain if God didn't
[30:45] come that's right so could you imagine
[30:47] remember this is never no one had ever
[30:49] built God a temple like this before this
[30:52] was new ground they had the Tabernacle
[30:54] in the wilderness they had all those
[30:55] things but now Solomon was building them
[30:57] in house how sincere do you think that
[30:59] would have been that day of dedication
[31:00] morning I mean when God you know was
[31:03] going to come down it would have been
[31:04] incredible incredibly sincere
[31:08] time and we should never let and I think
[31:11] as time went on From This Moment the
[31:13] temple became common to the people they
[31:15] got used to that's the that's the temple
[31:17] and there are the sacrifices this is the
[31:19] high priest this is they would got they
[31:21] would have got uh it would have become
[31:23] common to them Church order but we
[31:26] should never let it become common to us
[31:28] that we can gather as a people a
[31:30] blood-washed blood bought redeemed
[31:32] filled with the Holy Ghost people that
[31:34] God can come down and operate through
[31:36] everybody not just the musicians not
[31:38] just the preacher not just the tech team
[31:41] but everybody I me because remember we
[31:43] are all part of spiritual worship we're
[31:45] all here to worship God Amen we're all
[31:47] here to be part of the service amen
[31:50] we're all here to to to create an
[31:52] atmosphere by a surrendered life a Heart
[31:55] full of love that God can come and and
[31:57] dwell Among Us amen so so you know David
[32:00] David would would come to a place in his
[32:02] life when he realized that that all of
[32:04] the all of the sacrifices weren't really
[32:07] what God wanted he wanted more than just
[32:09] the form of worship he wanted the heart
[32:12] of the worshipper and he would write in
[32:14] Psalms 51 oh Lord open thou my lips and
[32:17] my mouth shall show shall show forth thy
[32:19] praise this is very this is a very
[32:21] common theme in the Book of Psalms
[32:23] praise and thanksgiving and joy I I'm so
[32:25] thankful those so like those are
[32:27] underlying themes of worship
[32:29] Thanksgiving praise and joy amen for
[32:32] thou desirest not sacrifice else would I
[32:34] give it thou Delight us not in burnt
[32:36] offering the sacrifices of God are a
[32:39] broken Spirit a broken and contrite
[32:41] heart oh God thou will not despise so if
[32:45] you come to God with a broken Spirit a
[32:47] contrite heart God won't turn you away
[32:49] you say I'm so broken I can't come to
[32:51] the prince of God I can't worship him
[32:52] like I really should no you can if
[32:54] you're in that condition cuz God will
[32:55] not turn away your sacrifice do good in
[32:58] thy good pleasure unto Zion build thou
[33:00] the walls of Jerusalem then thou shall
[33:02] be pleased with the sacrifices of
[33:05] righteousness with burnt offering and
[33:07] whole burnt offerings then um shall they
[33:09] offer Bullocks upon thine altar so David
[33:12] said it's not about the Bullocks it's
[33:13] about the heart of the
[33:16] person now the scripture tells us that
[33:18] we're a chosen generation a royal
[33:20] priesthood amen a holy nation A peculiar
[33:23] people that peculiar doesn't mean a
[33:24] funny people it means a particular
[33:26] treasure to God Amen you're very
[33:28] precious in His sight amen that you
[33:30] might show forth the Praises of him who
[33:33] ha called you out of Darkness Into His
[33:35] Marvelous Light Hallelujah am mean so he
[33:37] hasn't called you into just any light
[33:38] it's His Marvelous Light he called you
[33:40] out of darkness and brought you into His
[33:42] Marvelous Light for the reason that we
[33:44] would show forth Praises we would give
[33:46] show forth Praises of him who has done
[33:48] this for us and this is such
[33:51] a I'm probably going to repeat this a
[33:53] lot that phrase but in different words
[33:55] but in terms of it's a condition of us
[33:57] as we come to church really this is what
[34:00] it's all about because people think
[34:01] Church order I've got to line up with
[34:03] this and this and I've got to do all
[34:05] these mechanical things and the Dynamics
[34:06] of it is a surrendered Heart full of
[34:09] love to God and this is why brother
[34:12] baham taught a lot of the way he did
[34:14] with church uh Church order to get us
[34:16] all in condition that we can really
[34:18] worship God not just sing not just hear
[34:21] sermons not just pray and go home but be
[34:23] in a spiritual atmosphere that all of us
[34:26] can enter into spiritual
[34:28] worship because we know what has
[34:30] happened down Through the Ages like Paul
[34:32] saw it coming the Deeds of the nicians
[34:34] and how that spirit is or the doctrine
[34:36] and you know that white horse rider came
[34:38] through and you know separated separated
[34:40] instead of everyone being holy part of a
[34:42] holy spirit Ministry it was now only the
[34:44] priesthood of the ministry was holy and
[34:47] and this is a far cry to what it should
[34:49] be it should be that we're all in Holy
[34:51] Spirit Worship we're all part of the
[34:53] you're all on the ministry
[34:55] team you're a minister I don't know if
[34:58] you realize it or not but we're all a
[34:59] minister amen we're here to minister
[35:01] unto our God give him praise amen he
[35:03] says and even right today among those
[35:05] who claim to be free and full of the
[35:07] spirit there's not too much freedom in
[35:09] the ly and the best we can see is a few
[35:11] preachers with inspired preaching while
[35:13] the flock just sits there and tries to
[35:15] absorb it I pray I pray if we're in this
[35:18] condition Lord get us out of this
[35:19] condition and if we're if we're not in
[35:22] this condition may we never get into it
[35:24] amen where where it's not just maybe
[35:26] some inspir preaching here and there we
[35:27] tried to absorb it but it's actually
[35:29] we're all Anointed with the same Spirit
[35:31] we're all filled with the same Holy
[35:32] Ghost amen this is a far cry from Paul
[35:35] who said that when we all came together
[35:37] all had the leading of the spirit and
[35:39] all participated in spiritual
[35:43] worship amen now I'm going to get to
[35:45] church order dynamics of it I'm getting
[35:47] I'm just laying a bit of a foundation
[35:48] but if I run out of time I'll pick it up
[35:49] later now brother Braham says this in
[35:51] the dedication of um um of the building
[35:53] of the Lord he says so you see the
[35:55] dedication of a church doesn't really uh
[35:58] doesn't only mean coming and saying Lord
[35:59] I give you this building but it means
[36:01] Lord we give ourselves to you and
[36:04] sacrifice it isn't an a lily on the
[36:07] altar that God wants every Easter
[36:08] morning it's the cner on the altar it's
[36:10] not the class and the beauty of the
[36:12] building which is fine Solomon's Temple
[36:14] was the same but it's un but it's coming
[36:16] under the Articles of God coming uh
[36:19] coming s self-sacrifice to the service
[36:22] of God and when Israel had finally made
[36:25] one place that they could all dwell in
[36:27] come to a place and meet God Under The
[36:28] Fellowship of the blood then they begin
[36:30] to sing with joy they begin to play the
[36:33] harp they praised God in such one Accord
[36:35] until it sounded like one voice a
[36:38] singing then Solomon stood up to pray to
[36:40] make the dedication to the Lord and when
[36:42] he did that remember the ark had already
[36:44] been brought in under the wings of the
[36:45] cherubim and set back in the Holy place
[36:48] but when the people dedicated not the
[36:50] church not the building but when the
[36:51] people got with one Accord and prayed
[36:53] with one Accord and sang with one Accord
[36:55] and everything was of one Accord then
[36:57] the holy spirit in the form of the
[36:59] pillar of fire moved into the building
[37:01] and settled upon the place it was so
[37:03] much glory in that building until the
[37:05] priests could know could not Minister
[37:08] anymore amen and if I could say it
[37:11] another way I pray it comes into such a
[37:13] place that it's not man ministering it
[37:16] is God ministering it is God worshiping
[37:18] it's God singing It's God praising it's
[37:20] God singing It's God playing it's God
[37:22] preaching it's God saying Amen in the
[37:24] Pew amen that that the glory of the Lord
[37:26] fills these these temples so much that
[37:29] it's not us having church it's God
[37:31] having church cuz God loves to have
[37:33] church amen so I pray that this is this
[37:36] is what we aspire to to see God take
[37:38] control in a greater measure amen well
[37:40] we don't try and hold ourselves together
[37:42] we let God do what he wants to do that's
[37:45] it amen he says now God let it be again
[37:47] let it come again to this little
[37:49] Tabernacle we walk through the blood or
[37:51] under the blood of the Lord Jesus
[37:53] confessing our sins and be filled with
[37:54] the spirit and come here and you people
[37:56] this morning I say this evening should
[37:58] be just as glad and happy of this little
[38:00] Tabernacle as Israel was of theirs come
[38:03] under the same order so they come and
[38:05] happiness will come to your heart bear
[38:07] in your heart that you'll never condemn
[38:09] any man that's born of the spirit that
[38:10] you'll have fellowship with all of his
[38:12] servants with all of his people may this
[38:14] stand as an inter denominational
[38:16] institution amen amen may this stand to
[38:19] a place as a wering may come by may this
[38:22] be a place this house by the side of the
[38:25] road may it be a place where the pilgrim
[38:27] the wayfaring man can find rest as he
[38:29] enters its door amen amen so we know in
[38:34] the book of Acts that it says that when
[38:36] they with one heart one mind one Accord
[38:38] it's it's when they all with one Accord
[38:40] in the day of Pentecost that's when the
[38:42] Holy Ghost came right and that word one
[38:44] Accord means of one mind one passion one
[38:47] Accord amen so they were with one mind
[38:50] what is that one mind Lord I want to see
[38:52] you live amen what was that passion Lord
[38:55] your word is true you're the same
[38:56] yesterday today and forever Lord I want
[38:58] to see you do the miraculous I want to
[39:00] see you do what we think is impossible
[39:02] cuz all things are possible to you Lord
[39:04] I want to see you change lives I want to
[39:05] see you change my life this is this
[39:07] should be the passion of Our Lives Lord
[39:11] change me to match your word amen amen
[39:13] change me amen that when you see me Lord
[39:15] you see you amen this should be the
[39:17] passion of our lives and this was they
[39:19] were all with one Accord then the Holy
[39:21] Ghost came now it can be a thing well
[39:24] how do you get one Accord it's very
[39:25] simple you begin to Center your thoughts
[39:28] right now on the Lord Jesus see this is
[39:30] why brother Bram said that you know
[39:32] people should come early about 30 half
[39:34] an hour before church starts and and and
[39:37] there's an anointed piano player or or
[39:39] or some Godly music playing is that we
[39:41] can get out of the hustle and bustle of
[39:43] the week or day or morning whatever and
[39:45] we can settle our Spirits Down Under the
[39:48] presence of God and we can begin to get
[39:50] into the atmosphere get into the
[39:53] anointing before the song leader steps
[39:55] forth yeah amen if you can't get here on
[39:57] time that's that's fine this is not a
[39:58] law right I'm just talking about the
[40:00] Dynamics behind it you know this is why
[40:02] brother Braham I believe laid these
[40:03] things out is that we could we could
[40:05] come maybe we've had the worst morning
[40:07] of our lives but we can come to church
[40:09] we can begin to think on him we can get
[40:11] one Accord we can think on his goodness
[40:13] think on what he's done for us think on
[40:15] how how powerful he is and how great he
[40:18] is and what he's saved us from and we
[40:19] can have a testimony meeting in our
[40:21] hearts as where before the church ever
[40:23] starts and then you'll find yourself
[40:24] you're troubled and and and things are
[40:26] going on in your mind but by the time
[40:28] you finished you're praising God before
[40:29] there's ever been a hallelujah amen come
[40:32] through the place amen why because now
[40:33] you've got one Accord you've got into
[40:36] the spirit amen you're thinking on the
[40:38] right thing yes that's why there's such
[40:39] a mind battle in this day because if we
[40:41] can just begin to think on the goodness
[40:43] of God who's ever done that you feel
[40:45] troubled then you think on the Lord and
[40:46] what he's done and you go from sad to
[40:48] glad you may go from you know broken and
[40:52] whatever more but then you're happy
[40:53] there's a sweetness in the whole thing
[40:55] you're going through why because you
[40:56] know how good the Lord is amen that's
[40:59] why it's so important that's why it says
[41:01] we should all be with one Accord in one
[41:02] place that's why the Apostle Paul would
[41:04] say be careful for nothing now we know
[41:06] this is all good I mean this applies to
[41:08] any part of the day not just before
[41:10] service right but be careful for nothing
[41:13] but in everything by prayer and
[41:14] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[41:16] request be made known unto God we should
[41:18] always remember the with Thanksgiving so
[41:21] you pray for something add some
[41:22] Thanksgiving on the end oh yes praise
[41:24] the Lord and not just a little bit a
[41:25] whole bunch cuz
[41:27] we'll have eternity to give him thanks
[41:29] amen amen and the peace of God which
[41:32] pass passeth all understanding shall
[41:34] keep your hearts and Minds through
[41:36] Christ Jesus and finally Brethren
[41:38] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[41:40] things are honest whatsoever things are
[41:41] just whatsoever things are pure
[41:43] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[41:45] things are of a good report if there be
[41:47] any virtue if there be any praise think
[41:48] on these things those things which ye
[41:51] have both learned and received and heard
[41:53] and seen in me do and the God of Peace
[41:55] shall be with you praise the Lord so
[41:58] that's a lot of things to think about
[42:00] things that are true honest just pure
[42:03] lovely good report virtue praise that's
[42:06] a lot of things yeah that doesn't give a
[42:08] lot of gray matter for anything else
[42:10] really when you think about it amen
[42:12] that's why brother Bram says we should
[42:13] we should be in the be in the sanctuary
[42:16] early that we can get into a spiritual
[42:18] atmosphere before the first song is ever
[42:21] sung amen that's why it's so important
[42:23] now that our musicians are are we should
[42:26] all be dedicated to the Lord right we
[42:29] should be it doesn't matter if you never
[42:31] stand here never stand here never sing a
[42:33] special anything you should be just as
[42:35] dedicated as anyone else cuz we all part
[42:37] of this together amen amen because we
[42:39] know that there's power in music there's
[42:41] power in anointed Godly music amen
[42:44] because the whole purpose of playing you
[42:45] to think about it musicians when you get
[42:47] up here your mission is to cast out
[42:49] Devils you're going to cast out Devils
[42:51] you're going to disrupt the kingdom of
[42:53] Hell amen maybe the devil's been working
[42:55] on someone for weeks and months and
[42:56] building complexes and strains and pains
[42:59] and hurts but then you begin to play and
[43:02] all of the devil's work just gets busted
[43:04] to pieces I mean because the anointing
[43:06] of God comes down and sets that person
[43:08] free I mean just like David he took up
[43:10] the harp and played with his hand and so
[43:12] Saul was refreshed and was well and the
[43:14] evil spirit departed from him that's how
[43:17] important it is this is this is not just
[43:19] entertainment no this is we have a song
[43:21] service cuz to cast The Devil out of the
[43:23] place amen amen that's why we worship
[43:26] amen this is the Dynamics of why we have
[43:27] a song service we get into the spirit
[43:29] amen the devil gets cast out because we
[43:32] know that the yoke is D shall be
[43:35] destroyed because of the anointing so
[43:37] anything that's oppressing anything
[43:39] that's troubling anything that's going
[43:40] on in our lives that yoke is destroyed
[43:43] because the anointings the anointing of
[43:45] the Holy Ghost breaks the Yoke amen
[43:47] breaks mind battles blak breaks
[43:49] complexes and troubles and everything
[43:51] that's going on in life those are broken
[43:53] because of the anointing you may not
[43:55] have any trouble in the world but you
[43:57] can create an atmosphere out of a heart
[43:58] of love and Thanksgiving that can break
[44:01] every yoke in this place yeah amen
[44:03] that's right amen you can break yolks on
[44:06] the internet amen amen maybe the
[44:08] recording picks up your praise and
[44:10] Hallelujah and shout and then God
[44:11] anoints that and somewhere on the other
[44:13] side of the world and someone set free
[44:15] that's how powerful it
[44:17] is amen so this is why it's so important
[44:20] now and and we also know that the Lord
[44:22] inhabits the Praises of his people we
[44:25] know we are the spiritual Israel so you
[44:27] begin to praise God out of a thankful
[44:29] heart this is why we have trouble
[44:30] getting to church you know there's a lot
[44:32] of can be a lot of disruption in the
[44:34] morning a lot of things going because
[44:35] the devil doesn't want us to get primed
[44:37] and ready for you know to really have
[44:39] church we can sit through church but to
[44:41] have church is a different thing and we
[44:43] want to have church amen where
[44:45] everyone's anointed everyone's praising
[44:47] God where the word has effect in
[44:48] everyone's life and God does what he
[44:50] wants to do amen but you see that God
[44:52] inhabits the pra see the devil does not
[44:54] want God to inhabit your
[44:56] praise but if you really praise him see
[44:59] it's irrespective of what's got you you
[45:01] can to have the biggest battle of your
[45:02] life right now you praise the Lord the
[45:05] Lord will inhabit that praise amen amen
[45:07] so so you so we go to begin to praise
[45:10] God and then God comes down then what
[45:13] does he do he breaks the Yol of the
[45:15] enemy this is why we're all in this
[45:17] together praise the Lord amen I'm glad
[45:20] we're a team this is not a Onan band
[45:22] We're All in This Together doesn't
[45:23] matter how old you are who you are we're
[45:25] all in this together amen amen then
[45:28] brother Bram says this he says do you
[45:30] understand church that in doing this you
[45:31] have the whole church in the spirit of
[45:33] worship before the word comes into to be
[45:35] taught then the Holy Spirit gets in the
[45:37] word and manifests God through the word
[45:40] to be a confirmation of your
[45:44] worship your worship I take that as
[45:46] individual yeah who wants their worship
[45:49] to be confirmed by signs following now I
[45:54] put this in here because I and I begin
[45:56] to think well people are going to start
[45:57] thinking well I it's my ability that's
[45:59] going to cause this to happen no the
[46:02] first thing we must Master is the
[46:04] thought of human ability this is in the
[46:07] message perfect strength by Perfect
[46:08] weakness a very good message he says the
[46:11] important thing one of the most
[46:12] important things that we must Master now
[46:14] remember this and especially you young
[46:16] preachers and lay members alike and I'll
[46:18] say old preachers and who and and anyone
[46:21] there's one thing that we've got to
[46:23] master if we expect to fulfill God's
[46:25] desire in our life that is we have to
[46:29] master the thought of human ability amen
[46:32] if we ever get to a spot where we think
[46:35] we can do it with our own intelligence
[46:37] and our own abilities we've got to
[46:39] master that in such a way that we can
[46:42] get rid of the thing and lay it aside so
[46:45] that God can use us that's what it means
[46:47] by mastering the thought of human
[46:49] ability we got to get rid of that thing
[46:50] you say I know how to sing I know how to
[46:52] praise God I know how to do this you got
[46:54] to you got to get rid of that amen you
[46:56] say Lord sing through me Lord Praise
[46:58] Through Me Lord have your way through me
[46:59] Lord that it's not me humanly worshiping
[47:02] Lord may I just be watching you worship
[47:03] through me take over my being Lord this
[47:06] is why people actually are afraid I
[47:08] think in the past people have spoken
[47:09] against the gifts of the Spirit and the
[47:11] message is because people are afraid to
[47:13] actually let go and let
[47:16] God we should not be afraid to let God
[47:18] you know we pray Lord take over my life
[47:21] has he really taken over your life
[47:22] completely no now now in church it's one
[47:24] thing in life it's another thing because
[47:27] you should be able to let him take over
[47:28] your life that if you do something wrong
[47:29] you can put it right amen you don't tell
[47:32] lies you don't do Shady deals you don't
[47:33] do anything that's contrary to his word
[47:35] right you can put it right now in church
[47:37] we should be it's now now what am how am
[47:39] I going to sing this no Lord sing
[47:41] through me sure I may have a gift but
[47:43] Lord take the gift and may I not use the
[47:45] gift may you use the gift see balum
[47:48] would use a gift to try and get money
[47:49] out of the king of Moab to to curse
[47:51] Israel he was using the gift himself he
[47:53] was contacting God God was speaking
[47:55] through him the prophecies are still in
[47:57] the scripture but he was using the gift
[47:59] see we don't want to use a gift in our
[48:00] life we want God to use it amen so we've
[48:04] got to master this thought of human
[48:06] ability so when I talk about the
[48:07] Dynamics of church order like I am we
[48:09] got to realize that that this confir
[48:12] that God confirming our worship is not
[48:14] our ability that makes him confirm it's
[48:17] us yielding ourselves see brother Braham
[48:19] says a gift is actually getting yourself
[48:22] out of the way that's what a gift is
[48:24] getting yourself out of the way and the
[48:25] more you get yourself out of the way the
[48:27] more God can use you use the gift in
[48:29] your life and that's not just for
[48:31] ministry that's for everyone
[48:33] amen amen you see so it's so important
[48:36] that we that that we lay aside this
[48:39] thought well then how do we how do we
[48:41] get to a place where we where we don't
[48:44] get so concerned in our ability and we
[48:46] get into his ability well it's the same
[48:49] thing Make a Joyful Noise to the Lord
[48:51] begin to praise Him forget about
[48:53] yourself forget about your problems
[48:55] forget about what you're going through
[48:57] and the struggles and things and focus
[48:58] on the Lord hope this is okay tonight
[49:01] amen but you know God remember we we
[49:03] worship Jesus Christ here we don't
[49:05] worship our problems our complexes
[49:07] whatever no we're here to Worship the
[49:08] Lord am mean so if you want to get
[49:10] yourself out of the way think of the
[49:11] goodness of God think about what he's
[49:13] done for you how great he is what he
[49:15] means to you and you'll find yourself in
[49:17] a way happier space and you may get a
[49:19] little bit drunk that's good get more
[49:21] drunk on the spirit of God and you may
[49:23] have have yourself a real good time amen
[49:27] hallelujah praise the Lord and we may
[49:30] get out of order long enough till
[49:31] someone gets saved brother BR says that
[49:33] may the church get out of order long
[49:35] enough till someone gets saved what does
[49:37] that out of order mean that people
[49:38] aren't so rigidly holding on to
[49:40] themselves but they let God do what he
[49:42] wants to do amen amen let us make oh
[49:46] come let us sing unto the Lord let us
[49:47] Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our
[49:50] Salvation let us come before his
[49:52] presence with Thanksgiving and Make a
[49:54] Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms I was
[49:56] going to keep highlighting different
[49:58] parts of this Psalm but I was going to
[49:59] make it all yellow so I just stopped
[50:00] right there for the Lord is is a great
[50:03] God and a great king above all gods in
[50:05] his hand are the Deep places of the
[50:07] Earth the strength of the hills is his
[50:09] also the sea is his and he made it and
[50:11] His Hands form the dry land oh come let
[50:14] us worship and bow down let us kneel
[50:16] before the Lord our maker amen amen
[50:19] Psalms 34 a Psalm of David when he
[50:21] changed his uh his behavior before abich
[50:24] who drove him away way and he departed I
[50:26] Will Bless The Lord at all times his
[50:28] praise shall continually be in my mouth
[50:31] now this is David on the run in the
[50:33] Philistine lands and he's writing this
[50:35] okay this is remember he went before the
[50:37] king of the Philistines and acted like a
[50:39] crazy man to save his own skin he just
[50:42] does this now he's inspired to write
[50:44] this Psalm I Will Bless The Lord at all
[50:46] times didn't you feel foolish David by
[50:48] doing those things I'll bless the Lord
[50:50] at all times you
[50:53] know his pray shall continually be in my
[50:56] mouth my soul shall make her boast in
[50:58] the Lord The Humble shall hear thereof
[51:00] and be glad oh magnify the Lord with me
[51:03] and let us exalt his name together I
[51:05] sought the Lord and he heard me and
[51:06] delivered me from all my fears they
[51:08] looked unto him and were lightened and
[51:11] their faces were not ashamed this poor
[51:13] man cried and the Lord heard him and
[51:15] saved him out of all of his troubles the
[51:17] angel of the Lord encampeth about I mean
[51:19] round about them that fear Him and
[51:25] think upon those things cuz you got to
[51:26] realize the Lord has has delivered us
[51:29] out of many troubles because remember
[51:31] the angel of the Lord that's God himself
[51:33] an Angelic form not just the angels of
[51:35] God it says the angel of the Lord who is
[51:37] that the pillar of fire that's God
[51:39] himself he encampeth about them that
[51:41] fear Him amen so so he's your security
[51:44] detail every day of every day of the
[51:47] week amen and he deliver and he deliver
[51:50] them amen so to me that's incredibly
[51:52] important now so so that's the that's
[51:56] the before service and the song service
[51:58] now actually in the in the before
[52:00] service you know we should we should we
[52:02] should keep this place very
[52:04] special right because when he talks
[52:06] about respecting the uh Sanctuary to me
[52:09] it's a it's a it's an attitude thing
[52:12] that we should be very thankful now I'm
[52:14] not saying we take this place for
[52:15] granted but I'm just trying to emphasize
[52:17] something here that we should be very
[52:18] thankful that we have this place amen
[52:21] right hey if we had to be in a hall
[52:22] praise God a house praise the Lord but
[52:24] but we have this place
[52:26] that we don't have to pack up set up
[52:27] pack up set all those things we don't
[52:29] have to do those things amen we have a
[52:30] place we' got Sunday school rooms we've
[52:32] got a foer we got all these different
[52:33] things that we can we can leave here and
[52:36] enjoy but you see this is why we should
[52:39] we should never take this place for
[52:40] granted we should respect this place
[52:43] amen and so so brother B says now I
[52:46] would suggest have your organist to get
[52:47] up there at some real nice music if she
[52:49] can't be there put on a tape then play
[52:51] it or something another and have music
[52:52] real sweet Sacred Music going on see
[52:55] wise out so people come in and meditate
[52:57] on the Lord and think upon him and if
[52:59] the people's goes are talking carry on
[53:01] that let one of the deacons get up at
[53:02] the microphone and say shush whatever
[53:04] you know and say at the Tabernacle here
[53:06] we want you to come to worship let's not
[53:08] make noise now listen to the music get
[53:10] your seat sit down be reverent see pray
[53:13] or read the Bible this is the sanctuary
[53:15] here where the Lord dwells and we want
[53:16] everybody to be real reverent and
[53:18] worship not to be running around talking
[53:20] before service congregate yourselves and
[53:23] you come here to talk to the Lord see
[53:24] either be in silent prayer or read your
[53:27] Bible this is here amen and it says in
[53:30] Psalms here I remember the days of old I
[53:32] meditate on all thy works I Muse on the
[53:35] work of thy hands who is the work of his
[53:38] hands we are you are amen I stret
[53:42] stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul
[53:44] thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land
[53:47] sealer so when we come into church we
[53:49] should meditate upon his works I know I
[53:51] may be repeating myself but I think if
[53:53] we could just not wait till to the end
[53:55] of service to be on a spiritual higher
[53:57] let's just start on a spiritual high and
[53:58] go higher amen hey if you can't if you
[54:01] got kids and you can't be in here or
[54:02] you're late whatever more remember this
[54:03] is not a rule but this is this is the
[54:06] Dynamics behind it okay amen just so
[54:09] important and it's the same thing after
[54:10] service we you know we're not here we're
[54:13] not here to meet one another we got
[54:15] places to meet we're at a foer we can go
[54:17] outside we go next door we you we go on
[54:19] the street but this is not a place to
[54:21] meet especially after service we're not
[54:23] here to sit stand around and talk I know
[54:25] I'm guilty of it myself but let's take
[54:26] all the conversations out the
[54:29] door amen I think I think we shouldn't
[54:32] be letting kids running here sit down
[54:34] talk and all those things we got places
[54:36] to do that am me we can go to people's
[54:39] houses whatever more so we shouldn't we
[54:41] we should because the thing is we know
[54:42] especially in New Zealand we take things
[54:44] very
[54:45] casually we can't take God casually amen
[54:48] we can't we can't take him for granted
[54:51] we should respect them more and more
[54:52] especially as the day approaching where
[54:54] he's going to take us home
[54:55] amen because he's God remember
[54:58] Hallelujah this is not just some Idol
[54:59] this is not some of stone or man's hands
[55:01] this is God who made the body you're
[55:03] living in oh boy he holds your life in
[55:06] his hand he can just hold your breath
[55:08] for for a few minutes and you're gone if
[55:10] he wanted to amen but we have life in
[55:12] these bodies to praise Him amen amen to
[55:14] give him thanks now amen praise the Lord
[55:17] how we going for the time okay we're
[55:18] just going to go through so so this is
[55:20] the Dynamics of it now what we want to
[55:22] do is was is is in every service we want
[55:24] to build the atmosphere of the Holy
[55:26] Ghost amen we want to build it to a
[55:28] climax at the end that's what we want to
[55:30] do so that's why if we come in we're
[55:32] we're we're meditating on the goodness
[55:34] of God we're not thinking forget about
[55:36] the week forget about tomorrow it'll be
[55:38] there amen right even if we even if the
[55:41] dead in Christ raised tomorrow will be
[55:43] there right it may be a different kind
[55:45] of tomorrow than what you're planning
[55:46] but it'll be there okay it's going to be
[55:48] awesome but you see tomorrow will take
[55:50] care of itself okay so don't worry about
[55:52] where you come from what's going on in
[55:54] your life life just focus on the Lord
[55:56] and his goodness and that will get you
[55:58] into a spiritual atmosphere amen amen
[56:01] cuz our hearts have got to connect with
[56:02] him and worship right amen amen so then
[56:05] he says and and then so the songs and I
[56:08] appreciate our song letters but you see
[56:10] so so the songs now bring the
[56:11] congregation bring us into a greater
[56:13] spiritual atmosphere than just sitting
[56:15] and meditating see he says let brother
[56:16] Caps or whoever is leading the songs and
[56:19] have a song leader no matter who it is
[56:20] and don't let them stand up and say or
[56:22] carry on like they're a preacher let
[56:23] them just let them stand up there and
[56:25] Lead songs that's their business why
[56:27] because we want to create an atmosphere
[56:28] where the spirit of God comes down in a
[56:30] greater way have you heard brother
[56:32] Braham sa I'm waiting for the spirit to
[56:34] reach its peak and then I'm going to
[56:36] pray for the prayer cloths and so on
[56:37] right this what we want to do we want to
[56:39] want to build the anointing like brother
[56:41] BR says about you know during the end of
[56:43] a service says I see a real Faith Bank
[56:45] over the building he says it looks all
[56:47] milky I've seen that in places where it
[56:50] actually looks all milky over the people
[56:51] why a faith Bank faith is risen and
[56:54] Faith Rises and then when Faith Rises
[56:55] then people can claim what they need
[56:57] from the Lord and that's what we should
[56:59] really aspire to every service that this
[57:01] is not a natural going on this is a
[57:03] supernatural dealing between us and God
[57:05] where where Faith Can rise in our hearts
[57:07] unbelief can be cast out that we can get
[57:09] the promises get the things that we have
[57:11] need
[57:12] of amen and then and then he speaks
[57:15] about the length of preaching now I'm
[57:16] just going to go through this briefly
[57:17] but he says about 45 minutes is good 4
[57:20] he says and from 8 to4 to 9 so this is
[57:23] this is I think in the morning or
[57:25] evening I'm not sure somewhere between
[57:26] 30 and 45 minutes lay that word in there
[57:29] just as the Holy Ghost gives it to you
[57:31] see just like that just place it in
[57:32] there right the way he says do it see
[57:35] under the anointing and what is that
[57:37] because we don't want to wear people out
[57:39] right you want to you want to preach now
[57:41] I've already said this to the ministers
[57:42] so I'm just going to say to everyone
[57:43] here we're want to preach in such a way
[57:44] to build the service to a peak and then
[57:48] and then we worship why because then
[57:50] because the whole purpose of this is
[57:52] that people get in contact with God
[57:55] right the most powerful thing on the
[57:56] Earth is not the atomic bomb it's not
[57:58] the Hypersonic missile not the hydrogen
[58:00] bomb it's a man in contact or woman in
[58:03] contact with his maker and that's the
[58:05] whole thrust behind why we have church
[58:07] see amen he says and he says here you
[58:10] see you see for the sanctuary for the
[58:12] church see if you're making a tape and
[58:14] you've got a 2hour tape put a two-hour
[58:16] message on it but you see we're not
[58:18] making tapes right we have a
[58:21] message amen but if you're not making a
[58:23] tape for something like that then cut
[58:25] cut our message see cut your message
[58:26] down I'll tell you why there's some some
[58:29] fill up easy some fill up long see like
[58:32] that and we've got to be at a happy
[58:34] medium between that right so some people
[58:36] got a smaller tank just like a any
[58:39] vehicle on the street a a truck's got a
[58:41] big tank a min's got a real small tank
[58:44] they both have gasoline or diesel or
[58:46] whatever fuel that they need right so
[58:48] some fill up easy some fill up long so
[58:50] you got to find a happy medium that
[58:52] everyone can walk out of here full and
[58:53] happy and good cuz that's what we want
[58:55] to do right we want to leave church
[58:56] feeling better than when we came in it
[58:58] may have been a real hard service maybe
[59:00] the words torn the height off your back
[59:01] and torn the height off the preachers
[59:03] back and everything more but you feel
[59:04] good amen so so we want to walk out and
[59:07] and that's why he's talking about these
[59:08] things is because the Dynamics behind it
[59:10] is not to be short or what we would
[59:12] consider short for short sake is that
[59:14] the atmosphere the faith would rise to a
[59:17] point where people can get what they
[59:18] need from God he says because I found
[59:21] this at a service it stands up and the
[59:23] message is given in the power if you go
[59:25] too far you wear the people out and they
[59:27] don't get
[59:28] it I don't want people to walk out and
[59:30] say what did he preach on he I don't
[59:32] know I think that's kind of a that's not
[59:35] a win I want to have a win are you
[59:37] following me amen this is this is what
[59:39] we want to get right but you see now
[59:41] here comes here comes the point where I
[59:43] really want to get to and this is the
[59:45] whole point for all these things that
[59:46] we've just talked about the Dynamics of
[59:48] it right so so we've come into church
[59:50] we've been meditating on the Lord
[59:51] there's been a a holy spirit anointed
[59:54] pianist or musicians playing or music
[59:56] whatever more so so now we're in a
[59:58] spiritual condition now the song leader
[1:00:00] gets up greets the people begins to lead
[1:00:02] in worship and and what's been building
[1:00:05] up as we've been meditating on the Lord
[1:00:07] and reading and praying now can burst
[1:00:08] forth in Praise right for the song
[1:00:11] service then the minister comes along
[1:00:14] preaches us into Heavenly places
[1:00:17] amen and then and then now we're in a
[1:00:19] real atmosphere of worship it says then
[1:00:22] after the message is over then if the
[1:00:24] preacher gives a place in there where
[1:00:26] the people are all rejoicing the spirit
[1:00:29] amongst the people perhaps he might send
[1:00:30] another message if he sends a message
[1:00:32] it'll come to someone then an
[1:00:34] interpretation it will not just be a
[1:00:35] quoting of a scripture or doing
[1:00:37] something God don't use vain repetitions
[1:00:39] but it'll be a direct message to
[1:00:40] somebody to do a certain thing or
[1:00:42] something that will edify the church so
[1:00:45] he says if the preacher gives place and
[1:00:46] I think it's very important we give
[1:00:48] place to God Amen we let him take over
[1:00:51] amen remember this is not my show this
[1:00:53] should be the Jesus Christ if I can put
[1:00:55] it that way right the whole point of
[1:00:57] worship is God be exalted that we want a
[1:00:59] mount Transfiguration experience right
[1:01:01] that we didn't see Elijah or Moses but
[1:01:03] we heard a voice from Heaven about our
[1:01:05] lord Jesus this is my beloved Son hear
[1:01:07] ye him hear his word we see Jesus Christ
[1:01:10] glorified amen amen that so after the
[1:01:13] message is over and all the people are
[1:01:14] rejoicing right then God can come down
[1:01:16] the preacher what we give Place God do
[1:01:19] you want to use a gift in the body do
[1:01:21] you want to speak in tongues do you want
[1:01:22] to prophesy do you want to give an exort
[1:01:24] whatever it may be do you want to do
[1:01:26] those things Lord amen then there's
[1:01:29] space for that to happen amen because I
[1:01:32] believe like brother Braham said that
[1:01:33] all nine spiritual gifts should be in
[1:01:35] the local body amen right in the end
[1:01:37] time this is what we should expect to
[1:01:38] see all the nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:01:40] you know we should have it in the body
[1:01:42] and we have them I believe it but I want
[1:01:44] to see them be used more because I want
[1:01:46] to see everyone in spiritual worship
[1:01:48] amen I honestly every gift come to its
[1:01:50] position amen not just the ministry not
[1:01:53] just the musicians but every gift in the
[1:01:55] body I want to come to its full
[1:01:56] expression because this message remember
[1:01:59] is an adoption message it places your
[1:02:01] places the believer in their position in
[1:02:03] the body whatever they're ordained to be
[1:02:05] they to be in that position right so if
[1:02:07] they so if we're going to be placed in
[1:02:09] our position whatever gift is in our
[1:02:11] life should be in full manifestation and
[1:02:13] that's what we want to see amen so this
[1:02:17] is what we're looking for and I'm going
[1:02:19] to I'm just going to finish with that
[1:02:22] okay but this is the Dynamics of Church
[1:02:24] order I don't know what you're expecting
[1:02:26] this Wednesday but there it is okay
[1:02:29] let's come to church with greater
[1:02:31] expectation see we can have Services
[1:02:35] where God just takes over like we've had
[1:02:37] song services and it's like you just see
[1:02:39] you just feel the presence of God come
[1:02:41] down and the people aren't singing
[1:02:42] anymore it's God singing through
[1:02:44] everyone then the preacher gets up and
[1:02:46] it's not him it's God speaking and then
[1:02:49] in the after service people come up they
[1:02:51] get what they have need of or they get
[1:02:52] it in their seat or you know gifts start
[1:02:54] oper ating why cuz God just takes over
[1:02:57] that's right and that's what we want to
[1:02:58] have we want to see it don't we want to
[1:03:00] see more of him less of us amen we want
[1:03:02] to see God take over cuz why if we're
[1:03:04] the bride of Christ it's it's it's not
[1:03:06] our life see the church has always come
[1:03:09] musicians come up now
[1:03:10] please the church Through the Ages has
[1:03:13] always been trying to dominate over the
[1:03:15] word right this is why in the L here in
[1:03:18] age Jesus on the outside of the church
[1:03:21] is because they took the Creed and dogas
[1:03:23] of dogmas of man above the word of God
[1:03:26] but if we let the word of God have
[1:03:28] preeminence then what the word is can
[1:03:30] take over and live through our lives and
[1:03:33] he can do what he wants to do like he
[1:03:34] did in the early church we're in Bible
[1:03:37] days friends amen amen so let's um let's
