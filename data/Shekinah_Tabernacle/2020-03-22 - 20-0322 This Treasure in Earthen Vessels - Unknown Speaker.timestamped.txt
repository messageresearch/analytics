[45:12] I'm a nun you granny give you a piece of
[45:14] classical understanding I mean thank you
[45:17] musicians amen god bless you all
[45:20] let's just let's stand I just want to
[45:25] let's go to first Timothy chapter two
[45:29] we're going to want to talk about a few
[45:32] things first of you know they want to go
[45:36] into the scripture really but see is
[45:39] here in 1st Timothy 2 and 1 as we know
[45:43] we're facing unprecedented times he says
[45:46] I exhort thee therefore that first of
[45:50] all supplications prayers intercessions
[45:52] and giving of thanks be made for all men
[45:54] for kings and for all those that are an
[45:57] authority that we may lead a quiet and
[46:00] peaceable life in all godliness and
[46:02] honesty so the scripture instructs us I
[46:05] mean you can have your seats now that's
[46:08] true yeah you're the scripture instruct
[46:09] us we should pray for those in
[46:10] leadership you know we need to pray for
[46:15] our government that they make the right
[46:17] decisions to stop this virus from
[46:19] spreading you know remember the most
[46:21] powerful force that brother Brahim seed
[46:24] the most powerful weapon that God has
[46:26] placed in the hands of man is prayer and
[46:28] you think about how God has washed us in
[46:30] his blood he's made us joint ears in
[46:32] Christ I mean the blood puts us back on
[46:34] speaking terms with God so our prayers
[46:36] can change governments right so because
[46:39] remember you see the the the the crisis
[46:42] that's unfolding in Europe is because
[46:43] the government's made the wrong
[46:44] decisions right
[46:46] so we need to pray for our governments
[46:49] that they make the right decisions when
[46:50] to shut the country down whatever you
[46:53] know that they need to do they do it at
[46:55] the right time right brother Brahim
[46:58] season and in the message why in 1961 he
[47:01] says and I thank God for every serum
[47:03] that they got for the Salk vaccine pray
[47:07] constantly that God will give us
[47:08] something for cancer for poor suffering
[47:10] people anything can do to help I'm for
[47:13] it yes sir
[47:14] I'm a hundred percent for it and if we
[47:16] Christian people would pray more for
[47:17] such things as that would be
[47:19] off the whole country would yes great
[47:21] men they give their lives just trying to
[47:23] fight back at those things that crippled
[47:25] children and everything he says
[47:27] certainly she says I thank God for those
[47:29] things so we should pray for those
[47:30] things right you know we know that our
[47:33] help cometh from the Lord but brother
[47:34] and says I pray for he said who know
[47:37] that you know he prays constantly that
[47:38] God would give us something for cancer
[47:40] vaccine for cancer so I say we should
[47:43] pray all that because the medical people
[47:44] are doing all they can and they are
[47:46] God's instruments as well right so we
[47:48] should pray for them we should pray for
[47:50] our hospitals we should pray for our
[47:52] doctors for our nurses that the Lord
[47:54] would anoint them and use them and that
[47:56] they themselves would be protected from
[47:58] all sickness because remember it's not
[47:59] just you know it's not like all the
[48:01] other sickness just went away and now
[48:02] it's just this covert 19 there's still
[48:05] cancer there's every other sickness
[48:06] under the Stunner sill they're still
[48:08] having its way so we need to pray for
[48:10] them and we also need to pray for the
[48:13] lab staff doing the testing now as I'm
[48:15] sure you all know I work for a company
[48:17] called ESR and it's not my lab but the
[48:20] lab and Wallace field that does the
[48:21] testing for the cove at 19 so I know the
[48:24] people that are doing the testing and
[48:25] they are already busy that they're not
[48:27] just sitting there watching the world go
[48:28] by now they've got something to do
[48:30] they're busy anyway now they've got all
[48:32] this laid upon them so we need to pray
[48:34] for them as well they meant we you know
[48:37] we need to pray for these people now as
[48:39] was announced on Wednesday we have towel
[48:41] dispensers in the bathrooms we also have
[48:44] hand sanitizer which has actually always
[48:46] been on the wall but there's this one by
[48:48] the front door and there's one in the
[48:50] kitchen that has hand sanitizer in them
[48:52] and sister cares also brought some that
[48:55] she has made or something that's in the
[48:56] spray bottle on the on the table there
[48:58] by the offering box so and if we know as
[49:02] always you know if your children are
[49:04] unwell or you're unwell you know please
[49:06] stay at home we have the video streaming
[49:08] now we know that this may be may be one
[49:11] of the last services we'll all have you
[49:13] know in this present time we don't know
[49:15] we want to take advantage of every
[49:16] service we can come to but we have the
[49:19] video streaming available right so you
[49:22] know we have the technology and we voice
[49:23] had this technologies not that we
[49:25] suddenly wrecked it up because this has
[49:26] happened it's always been there so
[49:28] please always you know use your
[49:30] discretion as we always do remember we
[49:32] do our part
[49:33] but God does his part right so we need
[49:36] to be sensible you know this is a time
[49:38] we need to be sober-minded and also you
[49:44] know if there comes a time where you
[49:45] know because we want to do our part
[49:46] because we don't want to be a stumbling
[49:48] block to anyone right and also I want to
[49:51] look into it maybe we should set it up
[49:53] even now I want to set up either Skype
[49:55] or zoom for video streaming conferencing
[49:57] that it's not just say me preaching to
[49:59] an empty church and then you're watching
[50:00] it but we can actually interact so we
[50:02] can actually have service in real time
[50:04] and someone can sing a special someone
[50:06] can play and we can just all actually
[50:07] have church together right that's what
[50:10] I'm gonna try and see it up we have the
[50:11] technology so we should I think we
[50:13] should set it up now you'll try to at
[50:16] least before because you know we have to
[50:19] be realistic they may come a day without
[50:21] will raise the alert level to level 4 or
[50:24] whatever it is and I'll shut the country
[50:25] down because they have to so we should
[50:28] be proactive in this right I'm not
[50:30] trying to put fear and you remember our
[50:31] help cometh from the Lord we have the
[50:34] City of Refuge you know we we shouldn't
[50:36] be worried about any plague any
[50:37] pestilences coming around we do not need
[50:40] to worry about those things because the
[50:42] Lord is our strength in our shield he's
[50:44] our protector right he's our deliverer
[50:46] so we don't need to worry about these
[50:48] things you know the world is gripped by
[50:49] fear but we don't need to fear right but
[50:53] well I'll just say it now I'll coming to
[50:55] it later but if you are very fearful
[50:57] about these things you pray until you
[50:59] meet God until he takes the fear away
[51:01] right because this is member this is an
[51:04] hour where we need to be sober-minded
[51:06] you know I remember when the earthquakes
[51:08] happened in Christchurch Christine and I
[51:10] were living down there when the first
[51:11] one happened right and we were there
[51:13] until the day before the February 1
[51:14] where the people lost their lives but
[51:15] people you know when when when the first
[51:18] shaking happened people got real sober
[51:20] people who are in church and indifferent
[51:22] and just looking around and watching the
[51:24] world go by they got really shaken up
[51:25] excuse the pun but it's unfortunately
[51:28] many people it's like in Noah's day many
[51:31] people hung around the ark and they but
[51:34] then as time went by they just got
[51:36] relaxed and they just went off to what
[51:37] they're doing but there came a day where
[51:39] God told them to go and the Ark and God
[51:42] shut the door and if those hanging
[51:44] around the Ark only went in they would
[51:46] say you know their lives would have been
[51:47] preserved so we don't just want to hang
[51:49] around all what's happening and there's
[51:51] this trouble in the land rule and you
[51:52] know because this may go away yeah that
[51:55] may go away
[51:56] it may not right the rapture could
[51:58] happen right now we're in a rapture
[52:00] cycle anyway right so you know so we
[52:03] don't just want to hang around all
[52:04] there's a sickness and I could die and
[52:06] get into Christ
[52:08] whatever we do because it says in
[52:12] Hebrews 10:25 not forsaking the
[52:14] assembling of ourselves together as the
[52:16] manner of some is but exhorting one
[52:18] another and so much more as you see the
[52:20] Day approaching so if we can't meet
[52:22] physically we're going to meet virtually
[52:24] we're gonna have church either way I
[52:27] mean so that's what I want to try and
[52:29] put in place we have the technology you
[52:31] know we can do it I mean so let's just
[52:34] just on that note you know it just be
[52:36] sensible friends peace don't be caught
[52:38] up in the paranoia and the fear sure
[52:40] it's there but there's other sicknesses
[52:42] as well I'm not diminishing what's going
[52:43] on in the world you know remember the
[52:45] world may never go back to what we once
[52:47] knew it may never go back right but God
[52:51] is in control of everything
[52:53] and so we don't need to worry I mean but
[52:56] this is not out of God's program he's
[52:58] not he's not stressing he's not worried
[53:01] he knows his has you know he's on time
[53:04] he knows exactly what's going on right
[53:07] so we have to look at the right thing
[53:09] sure that doesn't mean we should just
[53:10] close our eyes and ears and say it's not
[53:12] there but we need to be aware God's in
[53:15] control and if your life is in his hands
[53:17] it don't matter what happens to you you
[53:20] can be sick with this thing you could
[53:21] have stage 4 cancer and the doctor gives
[53:23] you up but they can be such an assurance
[53:25] in your soul that I know where I'm going
[53:27] doesn't matter what happens to this
[53:29] flesh I know where I'm going I have such
[53:31] peace and joy you mean I'm going to go
[53:33] to where my Lord is now hallelujah
[53:35] and that's how we need to be right
[53:37] that's the condition we need to be in it
[53:39] doesn't matter how we feel you know it
[53:41] doesn't matter how sick we are how well
[53:43] we are how good times bad times rich
[53:45] poor doesn't matter but our soul should
[53:47] be in ready condition
[53:49] I've been washed in the blood of the
[53:50] Lamb ready to go I mean so let's um
[53:54] let's stand shall we and just just on
[53:57] that note let's stand and this read now
[53:59] Hebrews chapter 13 and and verse 5 and
[54:02] then I just want to go to 2nd
[54:05] Corinthians and chapter 4 so Hebrews 13
[54:09] and 5
[54:09] I pray by the end of this day you'll
[54:17] appreciate what you have what you're
[54:20] packing I appreciate I mean I pray
[54:23] you'll appreciate with all your soul and
[54:24] you'll be the most thankful people in
[54:26] all the world to recognize what God has
[54:29] done for you personally
[54:31] I mean Hebrews Hebrews 3 and verse 5 let
[54:35] your conversation be without
[54:37] covetousness and be content for such
[54:40] things as he have for he has said I will
[54:43] never leave thee nor forsake thee so
[54:46] that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[54:48] helper and I will not fear what man
[54:50] shall do unto me amen let's go to second
[54:54] Corinthians and in chapter 4 and I just
[54:56] actually want to take a a the first part
[55:01] of this of this verse of of 2nd
[55:05] Corinthians 4 and and verse 7 I want to
[55:10] take the first part of the verse but we
[55:13] have this treasure in earthen vessels I
[55:18] mean that's buried in a word of Prayer
[55:21] gracious father Lord we thank you for
[55:24] this day Lord as your prophet would say
[55:26] it's the grandest of Ages Lord where our
[55:29] people will not taste death but they
[55:30] will be taken lord they'll walk with you
[55:32] and shall be not because you take them
[55:34] and they did in Christ shall rise before
[55:36] them and Lord will go to meet go with
[55:39] him to meet you in the air it is the
[55:40] grandest of Ages look Lord every
[55:43] believer down through the ages Lord I
[55:45] believe they were looking for this hour
[55:46] and if they could they would trade
[55:48] places with
[55:49] but you've had you have allowed us Lord
[55:52] you've predestinated us to this moment
[55:53] and Lord I'm so thankful sure the world
[55:56] is in chaos and there's great darkness
[55:59] but Lord you are the one leading us dear
[56:01] God
[56:02] there is a light that has never shone so
[56:04] bright as this day that's more than a
[56:06] song to us Lord it's a reality father we
[56:09] want to thank you we can assemble for
[56:10] this one more time maybe Lord I pray you
[56:13] just take the service Lord these these
[56:15] brief moments as we are here Lord anoint
[56:17] your word like never before
[56:19] father let's want to get myself out of
[56:20] the way may you have your way among us
[56:22] Lord and don't just anoint speaker but
[56:24] anoint here as well father may you grant
[56:27] it dear God just move every barrier out
[56:29] of the way every stumbling block of the
[56:31] devil every complex every pain and hurt
[56:33] and worry move it all out to one side Oh
[56:35] God and maybe there just be a free
[56:37] Channel father have your way among us
[56:39] Lord we thank you we love you with all
[56:41] our hearts and Jesus Christ name Amen
[56:43] amen amen you may have your seats god
[56:47] bless you all
[56:50] this treasure we carry that's a great
[56:54] treasure sickness see as I said
[57:00] everything could go back to normal but
[57:02] we must remember that our lives God has
[57:04] allowed this to happen nothing's out of
[57:06] cater everything see God allows things
[57:09] to come upon the earth to get us into a
[57:13] position that is word we would be
[57:14] fulfilled in our lives
[57:16] see even viruses your people I don't
[57:18] need you I haven't even heard anyone
[57:19] these days say well if God's really God
[57:21] why does he allow these things it's like
[57:22] there's no consciousness of God in this
[57:24] country no more but you know even
[57:26] viruses we know that when when yo why
[57:28] does why does God allow this is because
[57:30] man was God over the earth and then he
[57:32] fell and sinned and then the devil took
[57:34] his position and then we can see even
[57:36] everything in nature has come out of
[57:38] kada because man fell from being God
[57:40] over the earth see even you take even
[57:42] the housefly that had its place but now
[57:44] it's out of its position rats mice
[57:47] vermin we call it they had their place
[57:48] but now they're out of their position
[57:50] even viruses I was looking at viruses
[57:53] because I'm a you know I'm in the
[57:54] scientific field and and and people have
[57:57] actually done research and they have
[57:58] actually proven that viruses actually
[58:00] have a beneficial
[58:03] place in nature amen
[58:07] so because God made them and now they're
[58:09] for a purpose we know everything he made
[58:11] was for good it wasn't for negative but
[58:13] because of sin nature's become perverted
[58:15] it's fall and it's come out of cater so
[58:17] now you know viruses are for death amen
[58:22] so we don't need to worry about nothing
[58:24] you know it's amazing when many people
[58:26] think you know when when God's hand is
[58:29] in their lives and and he is leading
[58:30] them they think of great bolts of
[58:32] lightning thunder voices from heaven but
[58:34] you know many times it's not that way
[58:36] but it can become a very natural thing
[58:38] now we see if we go to Luke chapter two
[58:41] and verse one that we're where we'll
[58:43] read about there came a time when where
[58:46] Jesus was going to be born and and an
[58:49] inspiration came on Caesar Augustus that
[58:51] he would tax the world now you would
[58:54] think that this would be a very great
[58:56] and convenient time because Mary's about
[58:58] to have the baby
[59:02] well journey they've got a you know
[59:04] journey from Nazareth down to down to
[59:06] Bethlehem with that where we are where
[59:08] Joseph was from now if first acts never
[59:11] happened they would never have gone to
[59:13] Bethlehem who would who in their right
[59:15] mind would put their full-term wife
[59:17] honor on a donkey and then I don't know
[59:19] how many days journey that was but even
[59:21] if it was just a day's journey who in
[59:23] their right mind would put their
[59:24] full-term pregnant wife on a donkey and
[59:26] take their take her anywhere
[59:28] but you see Jesus had to be born in
[59:31] Bethlehem he could not be born in
[59:33] Nazareth because the scripture could not
[59:35] be broken right so it looked like a very
[59:37] natural thing all this is going on now
[59:40] there's this tax and people have got to
[59:41] move this way and all this upheavals got
[59:43] to go on but the scripture had to be
[59:46] fulfilled
[59:46] right and it's the same thing amen with
[59:49] us we've got to understand oh this is
[59:51] your this via the others covert 19 is
[59:53] going on in this shutdown of economies
[59:55] and all these things are going on God's
[59:57] allowed it because he wants us together
[1:00:00] he wants us to get into our position
[1:00:02] that his word would be fulfilled in our
[1:00:05] lives see nothing is out of cater me
[1:00:08] because in our natural minds we think
[1:00:10] well the church will grow maybe we'll
[1:00:12] build a church and things will just
[1:00:13] expand and get greater and we have
[1:00:15] greater camps and greater conventions
[1:00:17] and greater meetings and greater and
[1:00:19] greater and then we'll take a rapture
[1:00:20] that may not necessarily be the case but
[1:00:24] that's in our natural thinking don't we
[1:00:26] think that I meant already making plans
[1:00:28] we'll need to take that office out maybe
[1:00:30] take that wall out you know we're going
[1:00:31] to find a bigger place people are going
[1:00:33] to come and now they might but they
[1:00:35] might not but where are you many times
[1:00:39] we get our minds are on the wrong thing
[1:00:41] and see the same Lord lead us through
[1:00:44] this time hallelujah so you know their
[1:00:48] whole lives were tipped up you know they
[1:00:52] would come to a desperate place where
[1:00:53] you know I doubt very much that you know
[1:00:55] Mary and Joseph will come maybe walking
[1:00:58] into Bethlehem you know Joseph would
[1:01:01] have been worrying all all husbands
[1:01:05] would would you know she'd be able to
[1:01:07] recognize this you know your wife was
[1:01:09] full-term maybe she's you know sweating
[1:01:11] she's uncomfortable you know you can see
[1:01:13] that the babies dropped
[1:01:16] it's on its way and now they've got to
[1:01:18] find shelter and he goes to the end
[1:01:21] tries to say look can you have a bit of
[1:01:23] sympathy for me and the Incubus is no
[1:01:26] and unfortunately in these days I don't
[1:01:29] think there's a lot of sympathy people
[1:01:31] fight over toilet paper you know they're
[1:01:33] all now it's all about a survival
[1:01:35] mentality there's no really love for
[1:01:37] each other right why is this now oh no
[1:01:40] we can't you know I'm sorry I need my
[1:01:41] toilet paper I'll fight you over this
[1:01:43] toilet paper you know it sounds
[1:01:45] ridiculous and maybe maybe last year if
[1:01:48] I said you know people are gonna fight
[1:01:49] over toilet paper you think that's crazy
[1:01:52] but it's happened it's happening people
[1:01:55] are panic buying all these things and
[1:01:57] you know we shouldn't worry sure we
[1:02:00] should prepare you know if your
[1:02:02] cupboards are empty you're not preparing
[1:02:04] even for tomorrow
[1:02:05] you should have food right you should be
[1:02:07] prepared in some fashion that doesn't
[1:02:10] mean buy the whole of stocks fairly new
[1:02:12] world and pack it to your house you know
[1:02:14] you need to be sensible but you know so
[1:02:18] so here here here this is going on
[1:02:20] joseph has no doubt he's getting a bit
[1:02:22] worried about his wife and her condition
[1:02:23] because he's got to look after her and
[1:02:25] then finally they find the stable Jesus
[1:02:27] had to be born in a stable
[1:02:28] he couldn't be born in the end he had
[1:02:30] because he was a lamb he had to be born
[1:02:32] in a stable see God's Word is perfect
[1:02:34] right and God's fulfillment of his word
[1:02:37] is perfect you know that was not the
[1:02:39] ideal situation maybe Joseph you know in
[1:02:42] his in his house there maybe they were
[1:02:44] getting a place ready they had a baby
[1:02:46] room maybe they had everything lined up
[1:02:48] in Nazareth but God said no you had to
[1:02:49] have it in Bethlehem and God
[1:02:51] orchestrated the whole he caused the
[1:02:54] whole Empire to be taxed just for two
[1:02:56] people to get to their place that the
[1:02:57] word would be fulfilled if that was the
[1:02:59] case amen for Christ to be manifested in
[1:03:01] that day what about this day and
[1:03:05] everything is and-and-and-and-and
[1:03:07] everyone's worried don't be worried you
[1:03:11] don't need to worry God will look after
[1:03:13] you God will if you have given your
[1:03:17] whole life to him now I'm not just
[1:03:18] talking about hanging around the Ark and
[1:03:20] seeing what's happening if you've got in
[1:03:21] he will look after you those are just
[1:03:24] hanging around don't just hang around
[1:03:25] get in
[1:03:27] I meant it a little it'll it'll save you
[1:03:30] a lot of sleepless nights
[1:03:32] Amen if you're in so they had to they
[1:03:36] had to move that gods were to be
[1:03:38] fulfilled we must be very aware that God
[1:03:42] is fulfilling his word in this day this
[1:03:44] is not this you know we should live like
[1:03:47] us today
[1:03:48] it could be not be today but it could be
[1:03:51] today that's why I say it could be now
[1:03:53] this virus is going on the world
[1:03:55] shutting down everything Jesus could
[1:03:57] come take his bride away now or he might
[1:03:59] not but you should be ready you should
[1:04:03] be ready this is this is where we need
[1:04:04] to be sober because now everything is
[1:04:07] being stripped away from the people what
[1:04:10] would happen if the internet went down
[1:04:11] we're in lockdown in the Internet's gone
[1:04:14] now every single comfort is gone what's
[1:04:17] going to happen see the problem is we
[1:04:21] have layers of you know basically things
[1:04:24] like it'll be okay I'll be okay I've got
[1:04:26] this up just like food for example I'm
[1:04:29] not saying it's gonna run out but here's
[1:04:30] an example my pantry is full I'm okay my
[1:04:33] guest bottles full I'm okay I've got
[1:04:34] stuff in the freezer I'm okay there's
[1:04:36] water in the tap I'm okay but what if
[1:04:38] the guest bar runs out or we can still
[1:04:40] maybe get some wood cook a fire I'm okay
[1:04:42] the electricity goes out you know and
[1:04:44] eventually all those things are stripped
[1:04:46] away then where's your security see if
[1:04:50] your if your if your confidence or your
[1:04:52] securities and natural things I wouldn't
[1:04:55] put my confidence and natural things
[1:04:57] because you will end up struggling
[1:05:00] worrying stressing over the doctors have
[1:05:03] got it in hand
[1:05:04] you know I pray we don't have an another
[1:05:07] Italy but you just travel to the other
[1:05:09] side of the world and you can see that
[1:05:11] that's a horrible things are going on
[1:05:13] there and they're stretched to the
[1:05:14] maximum and it's terrible people are
[1:05:17] suffering and the government doesn't
[1:05:20] have the answer
[1:05:21] we sure yes I said pray for them pray
[1:05:25] for them but our confidence should not
[1:05:29] be in anything natural it needs to be in
[1:05:31] the Lord Jesus
[1:05:35] now John would John would be on the Isle
[1:05:39] of Patmos that's amazing
[1:05:41] he gets thrown in a vat of oil they
[1:05:44] tried and they try and they try and cook
[1:05:46] the Holy Ghost out of him they can't do
[1:05:48] it you know they can't kill him they say
[1:05:50] well he's a wussy but which tit so they
[1:05:52] put him on the Isle of Patmos he had to
[1:05:54] be there sometimes we go through very
[1:05:56] very heavy trials but God has to get us
[1:05:58] to a certain place and John would have
[1:06:00] to end up on the Isle of Patmos because
[1:06:02] God was saying I can't have you here and
[1:06:04] give you the book of Revelation you have
[1:06:05] to go to this place you've got to sit on
[1:06:07] the snake-infested Island
[1:06:09] I remember now I'm going to open the
[1:06:10] book to you I'm going to show you from
[1:06:12] now to the time of the end hallelujah
[1:06:14] God was actually fulfilling his word by
[1:06:16] getting him there on the Isle of Patmos
[1:06:18] because because you know it says there
[1:06:20] revelations chapter 1 that that that's
[1:06:22] where he was and we know before this
[1:06:24] word was ever pinned down by John or
[1:06:26] whoever it was written down God knew he
[1:06:28] had to be there and God caused things to
[1:06:30] move for him to end up there yes the
[1:06:33] same thing with thee you know you know
[1:06:34] the yo you take the early church they
[1:06:37] sold all that they have now not
[1:06:38] advocating that but they will lead that
[1:06:40] way they sold everything they had they
[1:06:42] gave it to the church that when they
[1:06:44] when the persecution rose they had no
[1:06:47] place to stay
[1:06:47] and they had to go spread the word and
[1:06:49] and some people say that the church made
[1:06:52] such a big mistake by selling everything
[1:06:54] before the persecution said and no but
[1:06:57] God don't make no mistakes he led them
[1:06:59] to do that
[1:07:00] right so I'm not saying sell all you
[1:07:02] have right but he led them to do that
[1:07:04] because God was going to move them amen
[1:07:07] to to take the word everywhere you know
[1:07:10] because you'd think they'd have
[1:07:11] Pentecost well 120 in the up room that's
[1:07:15] how big the church is now the church
[1:07:16] goes to 3,000 and then you see you know
[1:07:19] they go from house to house and people
[1:07:20] are added to the church and Jerusalem's
[1:07:22] becoming a whole bunch of believers you
[1:07:24] think my the the millenniums going to
[1:07:26] see it in because because because the
[1:07:27] glory of the law is going to fill this
[1:07:29] place and you know that wasn't God's
[1:07:31] plan don't say no no you got to spread
[1:07:33] this word around but in the natural mom
[1:07:34] people might think what is going on I
[1:07:37] thought we could have this we have this
[1:07:38] big church now and you know you know
[1:07:40] your people are coming in it's
[1:07:41] incredible now you know what God's it
[1:07:43] what happened here we are but no no that
[1:07:45] wasn't man
[1:07:46] ideas they had that that persecution
[1:07:49] came in that they would spread the word
[1:07:50] everywhere so we have to have confidence
[1:07:53] God is in control remember we have our
[1:07:56] plans God has this planet Lord changed
[1:07:59] my plans to match your plan because your
[1:08:01] plan matters my plan don't matter right
[1:08:03] hallelujah so so the world was taxed to
[1:08:09] get Joseph and Mary to where they needed
[1:08:11] to be to fulfill the Word of God and I
[1:08:13] say
[1:08:14] this virus has been allowed to come to
[1:08:17] get us into our position that we will
[1:08:19] fulfill the Word of God amen you say
[1:08:23] well what is what is our what is our
[1:08:25] what is our purpose I mean you know what
[1:08:28] does the word we must fulfill God has to
[1:08:30] be fully tabernacled and man the power
[1:08:33] the third Paul must be manifested power
[1:08:36] of the spoken word must be manifested
[1:08:38] everything Adam had has to be manifested
[1:08:40] into people in this day not not in the
[1:08:42] millennium when the Devils bound but
[1:08:43] when the Devils here raging a mere
[1:08:45] people have to come to their position in
[1:08:47] Christ I mean that they know who their
[1:08:49] God as they know what he has done for
[1:08:50] them and they can speak as Adam spoke I
[1:08:52] mean in the winds and waves have to obey
[1:08:54] everything must obey their voice but we
[1:08:57] know the power of the third pulls not a
[1:08:58] public show amen so God is getting us in
[1:09:03] our position that he uses you not your
[1:09:06] favorite preacher not your favorite
[1:09:08] Church on the other side of the world
[1:09:10] but you right he wants to get you into
[1:09:13] that place but we must understand that
[1:09:15] persecution is not going to get us into
[1:09:17] that place I'm just going to read this
[1:09:20] and then I'll get down to where I was
[1:09:22] going to say so this is from the this is
[1:09:24] from the Patmos visions from the church
[1:09:26] age book no human being could stand in
[1:09:29] the full effect of that vision yeah John
[1:09:30] said he fell down as a dead man his
[1:09:32] strength that League gone John fell at
[1:09:34] his feet as though dead but the hand of
[1:09:36] the Lord and love touched him and the
[1:09:39] voice of blessing said fear not don't be
[1:09:41] afraid I am the first and the last I am
[1:09:44] he that liveth and was dead and behold I
[1:09:47] am Alive for evermore what is there to
[1:09:49] fear the judgment that fell upon him at
[1:09:51] the cross at the grave and when he
[1:09:53] descended was for us he absorbed the
[1:09:57] full brunt of the wound of sin
[1:09:59] and there is therefore now no
[1:10:01] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:10:04] Jesus amen I love that see for a for a
[1:10:09] surety our attorney is our judge he is
[1:10:13] both attorney and judge has judged the
[1:10:16] case of settle that is finished there is
[1:10:19] now there is now therefore no
[1:10:21] condemnation why should the church fear
[1:10:24] what promise has he ever failed to
[1:10:26] manifest before us why should at fear
[1:10:30] punishment or death it has all been
[1:10:33] overcome here is the mighty Conqueror
[1:10:36] here is the one who conquered both
[1:10:37] worlds of the seen and unseen not like
[1:10:40] Alexander who conquered the world at the
[1:10:42] age of 33 and you no other way to turn
[1:10:45] for further conquest so he died a victim
[1:10:47] of sin and righteous living not like
[1:10:51] Napoleon who conquered all Europe but
[1:10:52] finally was defeated at Waterloo and
[1:10:54] banished Hill Elba only to find himself
[1:10:56] conquered but nothing could conquer
[1:10:58] Christ he that descended has now
[1:11:01] ascended above all and unto Him has been
[1:11:04] given a name that is above every name
[1:11:06] yes he conquered death Helen and has the
[1:11:09] keys here of what he loses is loosed
[1:11:12] what he binds is bound there is no
[1:11:15] changing of it there is there was no
[1:11:17] Conqueror before him and there is none
[1:11:19] beside him he alone as the Savior
[1:11:21] Redeemer he is the only God and the Lord
[1:11:24] Jesus Christ as his name
[1:11:26] don't fear John don't fear little flock
[1:11:28] all that I am you are
[1:11:33] potin says yours as i stand in your
[1:11:36] midst and we're going to just check up

[1:11:43] as long as you've been a believer who's
[1:11:44] been in your mitts who's been walking
[1:11:47] around so Lord Jesus Christ if we could
[1:11:49] just look at the unseen realm and
[1:11:51] recognize the God that walks among us I
[1:11:53] mean he hasn't left us in this dark time
[1:11:55] he hasn't left us in this time of
[1:11:57] trouble and the time of trouble thou
[1:11:59] shalt hide me and the tabernacle of
[1:12:01] hyperbole and the secret place
[1:12:02] hallelujah
[1:12:03] I mean Sam's twenty sevens going to
[1:12:05] become more than a nice sum to you it's
[1:12:07] going to become a living reality and I
[1:12:09] pray through this time it will I mean of
[1:12:12] the word that you carry the treasure in
[1:12:14] earthen vessel will become more rich
[1:12:15] more important more vital than ever

[1:15:17] amen Oh Lu you know brother bran was
[1:15:22] saying recognizing your day in its
[1:15:23] message because you we have to
[1:15:26] understand national forces are moving
[1:15:28] I say already people are planning how
[1:15:30] they can re-engineer the world after
[1:15:32] this is gone people are planning people
[1:15:35] are planning doesn't matter if the virus
[1:15:37] was just a transmission across species
[1:15:39] or planted or whatever that don't matter
[1:15:42] but countries are now planning how can
[1:15:45] we exploit the change of the world
[1:15:48] because it's all about control remember
[1:15:50] the Chinese and the Russians are still
[1:15:52] going to fight America I mean the reason
[1:15:55] there is the EU and NATO speak I want to
[1:15:57] kick back against Russia so it's not
[1:16:00] like people are suddenly quit their
[1:16:01] national and your animosity you lived
[1:16:03] you know we're all friends now let's
[1:16:04] rally together maybe on the outside
[1:16:06] they're doing it back see deep down to
[1:16:08] know they're gonna settle some scores
[1:16:09] right because those national spirits are
[1:16:12] still there right so people are already
[1:16:14] planning how can we exploit this thing
[1:16:17] how can we we realign trade routes and
[1:16:20] commerce and how can we control these
[1:16:22] things you know we can't be you can't
[1:16:24] you say that's far-fetched no no when
[1:16:27] world war ii was going on the allies
[1:16:30] were scheming how can we reject while
[1:16:35] the war was going on people are
[1:16:38] proactive satan's product of but god's
[1:16:41] more proactive i mean so we don't need
[1:16:43] to worry but so national forces are
[1:16:46] moving to unite people and and you know
[1:16:49] but we must understand that national
[1:16:51] force will not put us into a rapture
[1:16:53] well the ban was say in recognizing your
[1:16:56] day and its message 1964 and basically
[1:16:59] every quite you knows like i think by
[1:17:00] the crust seeds something about all
[1:17:01] these quotes i'm using her before after
[1:17:03] the seals but i just say every quote he
[1:17:05] used was when brother brown was a
[1:17:07] prophet
[1:17:08] you know so I think I think brother
[1:17:10] Danny Steven see it I think that's
[1:17:11] pretty good cuz people that isn't after
[1:17:13] the seals is before the seals knows when
[1:17:15] brother Brown was a prophet okay so okay
[1:17:18] that's nice I can take it then I can I
[1:17:20] know I can I can trust that I mean son
[1:17:23] recognizing your Danis message in 1964
[1:17:25] he says the church has not recognized
[1:17:27] heard a member as you go through the
[1:17:29] message remember the book the word was
[1:17:31] coming open to the Prophet as God was
[1:17:32] walking with them it's the same thing
[1:17:34] with us you when you meet the Lord you
[1:17:36] don't know all things right but as you
[1:17:38] walk with him he opens his word to you
[1:17:40] you begin to realize who you are in
[1:17:42] Christ you begin to realize more what
[1:17:44] the Lord has done for you right you
[1:17:46] realize what he's given you and you
[1:17:48] realize more where you're going you have
[1:17:50] greater assurance right you just take
[1:17:52] the book of Ephesians they are spirit
[1:17:54] filled people you read Ephesians one
[1:17:56] whom you trusted you believed you were
[1:17:58] sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise
[1:17:59] whereby your seal to the day of
[1:18:01] redemption but then Paul now because to
[1:18:03] tell them Christ's position and now
[1:18:05] their position in Christ you once walked
[1:18:06] according to the Prince of the power of
[1:18:08] the year but you've been quickened right
[1:18:09] you now sit in heavenly places in Christ
[1:18:11] Jesus so he begins to tell them what
[1:18:14] they what's happened to them but now
[1:18:15] what they have in that position right so
[1:18:18] before the book of Ephesians came open
[1:18:20] to them they didn't understand that
[1:18:21] fully right so that's why the word comes
[1:18:24] up is just to stabilize us now walk that
[1:18:27] we know who we are we know what Christ
[1:18:29] has done for us we know our position in
[1:18:31] Christ we know the devil's position
[1:18:33] under our feet
[1:18:34] hallelujah we know we're going in a
[1:18:36] rapture it stabilizes our walk Amen so
[1:18:41] it's the same so as God is unfolding the
[1:18:44] word to brother branham we see early in
[1:18:46] the message he basically just joins the
[1:18:48] church and the bride together as one
[1:18:50] group but then he divides it out right
[1:18:53] as the wood comes open so you take the
[1:18:56] first seal for example he says I no
[1:18:57] longer call you church I'll call you
[1:18:59] bride that you'll understand so he
[1:19:01] actually he actually differentiates the
[1:19:04] two just like Abraham and lot there's a
[1:19:06] church spiritual Abraham and there's
[1:19:08] like the church nominal right so both
[1:19:11] both receive salvation that's why
[1:19:12] there's yo not even will be bright but
[1:19:15] not you know but that doesn't mean
[1:19:17] everyone else will be lost
[1:19:18] right there's different covenants we
[1:19:19] understand that
[1:19:20] we're under the bride Calvin er we're
[1:19:22] under the Abraham Covenant right
[1:19:23] somebody learned it a lot covenant but
[1:19:25] they still they're still safe from the
[1:19:27] burning they mean so you know don't
[1:19:31] throw everyone out right if we can
[1:19:35] encourage someone just to take one step
[1:19:36] higher and they walk with God I say
[1:19:38] praise the Lord right they may not come
[1:19:40] all the way up and as long as they take
[1:19:42] a step higher hallelujah right amen
[1:19:46] so now he says this so the church does
[1:19:50] not recognize your day like Israel back
[1:19:52] in her Promised Land she didn't know how
[1:19:54] she got there she's just thought just
[1:19:56] automatically back there why national
[1:19:58] force put her in her place now I'm going
[1:20:01] to say something now when he says that I
[1:20:02] kind of listen I'm going to say
[1:20:04] something
[1:20:05] national force put Israel in her
[1:20:07] homeland national force will put the
[1:20:09] church in the World Council of Churches
[1:20:11] but the power of God will put the people
[1:20:14] in the bride right though the world
[1:20:16] forces this way the world forces that
[1:20:19] way but God forces up with the Spirit of
[1:20:22] God which is the Word of God my word as
[1:20:24] spirit and life will put the bride in
[1:20:26] her place because she'll recognize her
[1:20:29] position in the word then she's in
[1:20:32] Christ then Christ will put her in her
[1:20:34] place no national force will do it but
[1:20:37] the national force dead driver's role to
[1:20:39] the homeland the National forces of the
[1:20:41] World Council of Churches will drive
[1:20:43] every organization into it but the power
[1:20:45] of God will raise the bride into glory
[1:20:48] out of it hallelujah I mean so this
[1:20:51] national force is pushing pulling
[1:20:53] putting people around but that won't put
[1:20:55] it into put us into the rapture I mean
[1:20:58] the power of God will lift us up into
[1:20:59] the rapture the Word of God will put us
[1:21:01] in our place Holies as I say are there
[1:21:04] shutting churches down and whatever more
[1:21:06] no no this virus is causing that to
[1:21:08] happen this is not an ecclesiastical
[1:21:10] pressure of a squeeze right it is it is
[1:21:13] national forces showing down because of
[1:21:15] the pandemic right but that will not put
[1:21:18] us in rapture and condition the Word of
[1:21:20] God will in our lives
[1:21:22] hallelujah I mean many people are
[1:21:24] waiting for a squeeze to come the
[1:21:25] squeeze has already come right I can't
[1:21:28] walk into a hospital and pray for anyone
[1:21:30] I can't go into a prison just pray for
[1:21:32] anyone I can't minister the
[1:21:34] there's already a pressure or limitation
[1:21:35] put upon us I mean that we can't just
[1:21:37] freely go on minister hallelujah
[1:21:41] so there is already a squeeze de menthe
[1:21:45] that's already coming it's already here
[1:21:47] yeah so you know but many people say
[1:21:50] well when the squeeze comes on then
[1:21:51] God's gonna really add not my life and
[1:21:53] things are really going to happen cuz of
[1:21:54] the squeeze no it's cuz the word of God
[1:21:56] in your life
[1:21:57] remember the squeeze on the manifest
[1:21:59] what's in you you take the book you take
[1:22:01] the first church you take the first
[1:22:03] church they were in the you know that
[1:22:05] day Pentecost Holy Ghost filled them and
[1:22:07] now the devil's going to come against
[1:22:09] them right after the gate beautiful
[1:22:11] remember brother bran would say the
[1:22:13] devil didn't even roll out of bed when
[1:22:14] the day of Pentecost happened but when
[1:22:16] they walked past the gate beautiful and
[1:22:18] picked up that crippled man and said
[1:22:20] such as I have give IV
[1:22:21] in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and
[1:22:23] walk then all of the guns of hell were
[1:22:24] trained against the disciples so now a
[1:22:26] squeeze is going to come on them and
[1:22:28] they were brought before counsels the
[1:22:30] pressure has come upon them don't preach
[1:22:32] in this name whose authority he's
[1:22:33] speaking in all those things and now
[1:22:35] beaten whatever more but now what was
[1:22:37] then then was going to come out remember
[1:22:39] before the day of Pentecost thee the
[1:22:41] leader of this group would cower under
[1:22:43] just people that he was warming himself
[1:22:44] by a fire as his Lord was being you know
[1:22:47] examined as the beaten and all these
[1:22:49] things and people came along and said
[1:22:51] aren't you one of them aren't you aren't
[1:22:54] you one of his disciples I don't even
[1:22:55] know who you're talking about
[1:22:56] but your own speech betrays you how you
[1:22:59] speak amen
[1:23:00] the words you use betray that you're a
[1:23:02] believer I know and these swears and
[1:23:05] curses and you know because the pressure
[1:23:07] came on just by a couple of people by a
[1:23:09] fire what the Sanhedrin it wasn't all
[1:23:11] the dignitaries of the church it was
[1:23:13] just a couple of people come along but
[1:23:14] what was in him came out a squeeze came
[1:23:16] on his life and he miserably failed but
[1:23:20] Jesus said he would hallelujah but God
[1:23:23] knows how to get pride out of our lives
[1:23:25] right God knows how to get us in
[1:23:27] condition remember I mean so now it says
[1:23:29] so here he was he buckled under it Peter
[1:23:31] did I'm talking about Peter if you know
[1:23:32] her you know and then so suddenly but
[1:23:34] then the day Pentecost came and he
[1:23:37] received a force in his life he received
[1:23:40] a life of God himself
[1:23:41] hallelujah not a part of the God here
[1:23:44] the God he came into full of Sagada body
[1:23:46] was in Christ and
[1:23:47] everything that God pulled into Christ
[1:23:48] he pulled into the church I mean so was
[1:23:51] God now separating himself into the
[1:23:53] believers so now here he was with this
[1:23:55] life and now he's staying before the
[1:23:57] Sanhedrin not by a fire with a couple of
[1:23:59] people the same counsel that crucified
[1:24:02] Jesus Christ he was standing in front of
[1:24:03] he knew what they did to his Lord and he
[1:24:08] just said well see it brings out what's
[1:24:11] in you he says should we serve God or
[1:24:13] men that was there wasn't eloquent it
[1:24:16] wasn't well put together didn't come
[1:24:18] with the conclusion and a maybe hook in
[1:24:20] the year no sure hey should we do
[1:24:21] whoever they tell us and they beat them
[1:24:25] they threaten them what they do that
[1:24:27] went out rejoicing because they were
[1:24:29] counted worthy a mentor suffer
[1:24:31] persecution because of their Lord they
[1:24:33] just wouldn't they were happy they
[1:24:35] weren't chilly
[1:24:36] they had bruises they had beatings for
[1:24:38] though just rejoicing hallelujah
[1:24:40] then they had prayer and God came down
[1:24:42] shook the place gave them boldness and
[1:24:44] they went continue preaching the word
[1:24:45] why what happened cuz the squeeze came
[1:24:47] on but what was in them came out I mean
[1:24:50] the annoying girl was in them just
[1:24:51] manifested upon their lives hallelujah
[1:24:55] it's the same thing today that's why I
[1:24:57] say if you are panicking about this
[1:24:59] virus meet the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:01] pray through till you meet him amen so
[1:25:05] they had a squeeze and it just brought
[1:25:07] out was in them the bride has the goods
[1:25:11] if you had the Lord Jesus Christ in your
[1:25:14] life you have what you need Allu yeah he
[1:25:18] says in Christ in the mystery of God
[1:25:19] revealed and his church stands alone
[1:25:23] she is not hooked up with nothing but he
[1:25:25] was identified by God being the body
[1:25:27] that God dwelt and speaking of our Lord
[1:25:29] Jesus and the church is identified by
[1:25:32] his body doing the same thing amen you
[1:25:35] know it's amazing you pick up this book
[1:25:37] you read the things that God did and
[1:25:40] then you look in your own life and you
[1:25:43] say Lord I see the same life and me he
[1:25:47] see it Moses was a very proud man before
[1:25:50] he met the burning bush remember he was
[1:25:52] raised in Pharaoh's Palace he had as he
[1:25:54] was basically the next one to step on
[1:25:56] that throne you know in Egypt the
[1:25:59] Pharaohs was considered gods
[1:26:01] they weren't meek humble look no I'm
[1:26:04] Ferro you know my very print meat coming
[1:26:08] into the room demands respect and my
[1:26:10] word is absolute I'm God over you that's
[1:26:13] what they would death do you think the
[1:26:15] kind of persona that that that they
[1:26:17] would carry they wouldn't walk along
[1:26:19] like this and so nice to meet you and
[1:26:21] you're so you know how are you and like
[1:26:23] what they can't know I'm Farrah do this
[1:26:26] do this kill him do this do this right
[1:26:29] away that was how Moses was raised but
[1:26:33] when he met the pillar fire in the
[1:26:36] burning bush he had the right of himself
[1:26:39] is the meekest man in all the world
[1:26:40] because he met God his nature was
[1:26:43] changed because he had a visitation with
[1:26:45] God he had a meeting with God and that
[1:26:48] was attribute of Christ character being
[1:26:49] manifested in Moses life hallelujah and
[1:26:53] then you see the Lord Jesus the meek
[1:26:55] lonely man from Galilee right and you
[1:26:59] see Peter gets a sword tries to be
[1:27:02] gung-ho miserably fails but then he
[1:27:04] meets the Lord his characters changed
[1:27:07] Saul Saul of Tarsus becomes Paul I'm
[1:27:09] gonna kill these people I'm gonna put a
[1:27:11] squeeze on this church and I'm gonna
[1:27:13] stop it happening and then he meets the
[1:27:14] Lord on the road to Damascus his whole
[1:27:16] life has changed
[1:27:18] yeah can you see that it can you see
[1:27:22] that God has done something in your life
[1:27:23] I mean the the character you now possess
[1:27:26] is not your own natural character as the
[1:27:28] character of God hallelujah
[1:27:31] I mean why cuz the word has put on flesh
[1:27:36] Amen hallelujah
[1:27:38] see it's his body the manifested truth
[1:27:41] of his promised word for the last days
[1:27:43] that's you shall I say that again she is
[1:27:45] his body remember that we are the body
[1:27:47] of Christ young she is his body the
[1:27:50] manifested truth of the office of his
[1:27:52] promised word for the last days and she
[1:27:55] and she stands alone by it that's why
[1:27:56] the devils howling these great
[1:27:58] organizations to set up something to
[1:28:00] close her up they'll never do it she'll
[1:28:04] be taken up not closed up she is now
[1:28:06] risen and the power of the vindicated
[1:28:09] word promised to her by the power of the
[1:28:11] vindicated word promise to her amen so
[1:28:13] she won't be closed up
[1:28:15] be taken up well when will the churches
[1:28:18] be closed up in the tribulation when the
[1:28:21] devil has full control over the earth oh
[1:28:23] there's gonna come a boycott sure but
[1:28:26] while the bride is here while the bride
[1:28:29] is here she has a ministry right so
[1:28:33] don't worry oh is this the big time
[1:28:36] without clothes churches this is a
[1:28:38] pandemic we don't need to worry she'll
[1:28:42] be taken up now when did he say this
[1:28:44] after the seals opened when he was a
[1:28:47] prophet okay because we can't we can't
[1:28:51] live in such a way oh there's gonna be a
[1:28:53] boycott the church is going to be closed
[1:28:54] up and all winds it's going to happen
[1:28:56] and basically we're like looking for a
[1:28:57] train wreck to happen you know imagine
[1:29:00] people who live in fear that I'm gonna
[1:29:03] get hit by a car when I cross the road
[1:29:04] they'll never cross the road they get so
[1:29:06] fixated on this disaster that may happen
[1:29:09] because statistically you can't get hit
[1:29:13] by a car crossing the road unfortunately
[1:29:16] happens to people I don't mean it
[1:29:18] lightly but you know statistically you
[1:29:21] know stepladders are they're dangerous
[1:29:26] things so does that mean I shouldn't use
[1:29:30] a stepladder no you just don't be afraid
[1:29:32] don't be so fixated on the negative
[1:29:35] maybe off but you know statistically you
[1:29:39] know your toaster could electrocute you
[1:29:41] I don't know you know I know it's
[1:29:43] ridiculous but these things can happen
[1:29:44] does that mean we stop using toasters no
[1:29:46] I like toast I'm gonna toast them I'm
[1:29:49] gonna use a toaster I could die driving
[1:29:51] my car doesn't man gonna walk over it no
[1:29:53] I'm gonna drive oh you know I can drive
[1:29:56] the Lord's giving me a car I'm gonna use
[1:29:57] it you know what I mean but we can't
[1:29:59] just live in fear oh the World Council
[1:30:01] of Churches are going to come and close
[1:30:03] this up and all this is going to happen
[1:30:04] and we're gonna kind of bunker away and
[1:30:06] just kind of survivalist mentality and
[1:30:08] just you know survive we don't heat just
[1:30:10] to survive we hit overcome we're here to
[1:30:13] be a witness we're here to be the light
[1:30:15] of the world as we heard on Wednesday
[1:30:16] year the salt of the earth
[1:30:18] amen you're the salt of the earth you
[1:30:20] are the salt of the earth I mean so we

[1:30:36] back they were sick but they were sick
[1:30:37] before they went to Australia and and
[1:30:39] this time of year they get sick you know
[1:30:42] but because of the symptoms are so close
[1:30:44] to everything else they're like well you
[1:30:46] go home for two weeks rest and I think
[1:30:48] why can't I go home for do you know
[1:30:50] anyway yeah you know but if once
[1:30:53] everyone's panicking and and that
[1:30:56] doesn't mean I'm blase no we're not
[1:30:58] blase about this right
[1:31:00] you don't be blase be sensible but you
[1:31:02] know now we can't you know we've got a

[1:32:05] an atmosphere around you everything's
[1:32:07] going to be alright you can actually
[1:32:09] lift people that the prints of God in
[1:32:11] life actually lift the fear off people
[1:32:14] but be the salt of the earth don't just
[1:32:17] get caught up here yeah sure it's bad
[1:32:19] sure you know it is a terrible thing but
[1:32:21] don't get caught up in the paranoia and
[1:32:23] the fear about it

[1:32:31] okay remember God's in control I mean

[1:35:15] really have what we believe we should
[1:35:17] have right see there should be such an
[1:35:20] assurance in our hearts I mean that

[1:35:37] 4 cancer remember everyone in life I
[1:35:40] just want to say this if times you go on
[1:35:42] you'll come a stage in our lives with a
[1:35:44] doctor say I'm sorry there's nothing
[1:35:46] more I can do everyone has to come to
[1:35:49] that point and they'll either say it to
[1:35:51] you if you're conscious or though your
[1:35:53] family right that unfortunately you know
[1:35:56] praise the Lord for the medical field we
[1:35:59] have my sister as a nurse and I see you
[1:36:02] at Middlemore Hospital at Auckland we
[1:36:03] got brother Anini as well
[1:36:04] yes Oh God god bless the medical field
[1:36:06] god bless the healthcare workers and
[1:36:08] everything we have right but there will
[1:36:10] come a time in everyone's life if time
[1:36:12] should carry on where the doctors will
[1:36:15] say I'm sorry there's nothing more we
[1:36:17] can do but even if it comes to that
[1:36:21] place there should be such a joy and
[1:36:25] peace there should be no I'm not saying
[1:36:28] about saying you just mentally woke up
[1:36:29] there should be such a joy
[1:36:33] the sickness take my life I know where
[1:36:36] I'm going and I know that the one that I
[1:36:38] have loved and I've walked with all
[1:36:40] these years is gonna carry me through
[1:36:42] the door of death up into glory I mean
[1:36:45] that's how it should be
[1:36:46] Alleluia that though this thing take me
[1:36:48] I don't need to fear nothing because the
[1:36:51] one you know brother Brown win win when
[1:36:53] he would go speak to his wife hope when
[1:36:56] she's uh I think she died in any and he
[1:36:58] spoke to her and she came back to life
[1:36:59] and you know you know she said to him
[1:37:02] you you know it's such an amazing place
[1:37:06] because she went up into glory
[1:37:07] but you know so little about it this
[1:37:11] Holy Ghost you speak about how great it
[1:37:13] really is how great you know we think
[1:37:16] about you know many times people say
[1:37:18] well how horrible the tribulation will
[1:37:19] be how horrible being in Hell will be
[1:37:21] sure but we many times I think we
[1:37:23] neglect the reality of how great heaven
[1:37:26] will be how amazing it will be amen to
[1:37:29] be in a place with no sickness sorrow
[1:37:31] pain no worry no no bad days just
[1:37:35] perfect peace yeah when brother Brown
[1:37:37] was taking pastor Curtin a time he says
[1:37:39] it's so sublime he can't describe how
[1:37:41] great it really is and even Paul he says
[1:37:43] I knew a man that was lifted up into the
[1:37:44] third heaven he couldn't speak about if
[1:37:46] I know how many years there was himself
[1:37:48] but such a great place holy I think many
[1:37:52] times we we don't focus on that how
[1:37:56] great heaven really will be and really
[1:37:58] is hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if
[1:38:07] you don't have that assurance this
[1:38:09] morning there is a Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:11] here to give you that assurance right
[1:38:14] because heaven is such a great place you
[1:38:18] know myself I do not serve the Lord
[1:38:20] Jesus because I don't want to go through
[1:38:22] the Great Tribulation I'm scared I'll go
[1:38:24] to hell I don't serve him because of
[1:38:25] those things I serve Him because He
[1:38:27] first loved me I serve him because I
[1:38:29] love him I lived this life because I
[1:38:31] loved him because he loved me he
[1:38:32] redeemed me he took my sin upon his
[1:38:35] shoulder he paved away from me I mean
[1:38:37] he's my light in the darkness when I was
[1:38:39] his enemy he redeemed me on the cross
[1:38:41] he's washed
[1:38:42] my son I mean that's why I serve him
[1:38:44] it's not out of fear or worry or what's
[1:38:47] going to happen I'm not worried about
[1:38:49] what's gonna happen he said well you
[1:38:51] just being blase no I'm not being blase
[1:38:53] I know who's a if you know the one in
[1:38:56] control again said Lord I've given my
[1:38:58] whole life to you every and although I
[1:39:00] am Lord I've done everything hallelujah
[1:39:02] according to your word amen and then I
[1:39:04] can you know what more can we do now
[1:39:07] brother brother Brown makes a statement
[1:39:09] and the token message and many people
[1:39:14] use this as a as a fear
[1:39:19] I'll read this one then I'll go the next
[1:39:22] one this is in the token remember this
[1:39:25] is the message the messages you must
[1:39:28] have the Holy Ghost what is the message
[1:39:30] you believe you God's gonna dwell in you
[1:39:33] you got to have the whole you gonna be
[1:39:34] born again that is actually the myth
[1:39:35] that's 1,100 tapes in a nutshell that's
[1:39:37] the Bible in a nutshell you got to be
[1:39:39] born again
[1:39:41] that's the message right
[1:39:43] that's the message people say how do I
[1:39:45] explain what I believe you gotta be born
[1:39:47] again that's it
[1:39:47] you really gotta know the the author of
[1:39:49] the book you got to know him right
[1:39:51] hallelujah a simple a real simple real
[1:39:54] simple amen
[1:39:56] now he says and when we display the
[1:39:58] token of the Holy Spirit well let's just
[1:40:00] draw back a bit there's a worse plague
[1:40:02] today then this covered might 19 the
[1:40:06] last plague destroyed Egypt before they
[1:40:08] left was death spiritual death is
[1:40:10] striking people in this world and people
[1:40:12] seem unconcerned about it they're they
[1:40:14] people start panicking as soon as the
[1:40:16] viruses is broken out upon the community
[1:40:18] but what about your spiritual life what
[1:40:22] about what about the real virus that's
[1:40:25] striking the world we should be more
[1:40:27] concerned about that now as I say
[1:40:29] doesn't mean you turn a blind eye to
[1:40:30] what's going on in the world we do what
[1:40:32] that you have the government says we
[1:40:34] can't gather we won't gather we respect
[1:40:35] what they say right they are here to
[1:40:38] look after us
[1:40:39] you know we elect them into office
[1:40:41] they're here to serve us you know that
[1:40:44] right they're here for the public good
[1:40:46] just like the police force I'm scared of
[1:40:48] the police no they're here to look after
[1:40:49] me I mean anyone I don't know I'm going
[1:40:53] off on that but you know sometimes all
[1:40:55] they see the beginning me no no no no no
[1:40:57] no no no God's allowed it
[1:41:01] this just relax about it let's just
[1:41:03] rejoice in our Lord let's not get all
[1:41:05] tense amen anyway he's so the last
[1:41:11] plague to strike Egypt before they left
[1:41:14] was death and now but they were but the
[1:41:18] Israelites or anyone was told if you
[1:41:21] just take a blood of the lamb and put on
[1:41:22] the doorpost door and lintel the death
[1:41:24] angel cannot strike you a man that's the
[1:41:27] same thing today if we have now we know
[1:41:29] we don't have the literal blood of Jesus
[1:41:31] Christ but the life that was in the
[1:41:32] blood
[1:41:33] can come into US and that is the token I
[1:41:35] mean when God sees his life and you
[1:41:37] death could not strike you hallelujah
[1:41:41] well how do I know death hasn't struck
[1:41:44] me he's still concerned about your
[1:41:45] spiritual welfare amen is there
[1:41:49] something in you saying Lord I want to
[1:41:50] live for you want to serve you all I
[1:41:52] want to know you
[1:41:52] I say well then that means death hasn't
[1:41:54] struck you because many times we panic
[1:41:57] or what's going to happen under just
[1:41:58] walk with God he says and when we can
[1:42:00] display the token of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:02] shows that we've been accepted in Christ
[1:42:05] that is our token that all that we have
[1:42:09] need of his already purchased by him we
[1:42:11] are identified with our token the token
[1:42:13] must be ready the blood the covenant
[1:42:16] blood is not recognized without the
[1:42:18] token the word assures us of the promise
[1:42:21] the token is the sign the purchase has
[1:42:23] been made for us
[1:42:24] he says full obedience to the full word
[1:42:27] of God and titles us to the token no
[1:42:29] other way is there that we could even be
[1:42:33] entitled to the token until you fully
[1:42:34] obey the word not what somebody has put
[1:42:37] into it or added to it but what God said
[1:42:39] about it now many times when people use
[1:42:42] those things they people were going to
[1:42:43] make a checklist in their lives
[1:42:45] am i dressing right as my skirt long
[1:42:48] enough as my hair long enough as my
[1:42:50] whatever you know do I do i do I conduct
[1:42:53] myself the right way do you know it's
[1:42:55] all about it becomes a list of do's and
[1:42:56] don'ts yeah but then he says and I've
[1:43:02] gone to another token message and show
[1:43:03] this even clearer but he says now when
[1:43:06] he said that you must be born again so
[1:43:08] he's saying a full obedience to the full
[1:43:09] word of God entitles us to the token he
[1:43:12] says that now then when he said you must
[1:43:13] be born again that don't mean jump up
[1:43:15] and down at the altar that doesn't mean
[1:43:17] walk back here and shake hands with a
[1:43:18] pastor that doesn't mean all this
[1:43:19] fullness just that we've seen done it
[1:43:21] means putting your name or and you know
[1:43:24] don't mean putting your name on a church
[1:43:25] book it means death to your first being
[1:43:28] your first life and life to the second
[1:43:30] being so the old you is dead amen
[1:43:33] because just like baptism were buried
[1:43:34] with him in Baptism they will come for
[1:43:36] the newness of life so the old one of
[1:43:38] you is dead and beard and and is a sign
[1:43:40] put on it no resuscitation do not
[1:43:42] resuscitate right and you come forth and
[1:43:45] as
[1:43:45] new creature in Christ but I remember
[1:43:47] because when we say when you creatures
[1:43:49] in Christ it's not something we just
[1:43:51] grow into now our life comes into us
[1:43:53] that changes us right it's not to some
[1:43:56] learn behavior or I'm a believer because
[1:43:58] I've learned a behavior no it's not that
[1:43:59] it's when God Himself comes and dwells
[1:44:01] in you I mean and by the blood of the
[1:44:04] Cross he can come and dwell in you and
[1:44:05] that's what the messages you must be
[1:44:07] born again God himself must dwell in you
[1:44:09] hallelujah amen and that the blood is
[1:44:14] being applied and you're identified by
[1:44:16] the life of Jesus Christ so if you have
[1:44:18] the Holy Ghost in your life the Bloods
[1:44:19] been applied if the blood has been
[1:44:22] applied all sin has been scrubbed off of
[1:44:24] your account how Louie everything held
[1:44:27] again she's been scrubbed off Amy
[1:44:29] because the Bloods been applied
[1:44:31] hallelujah and you're identified by the
[1:44:33] life of Jesus and if he be the vine and
[1:44:35] we be the branches the life that's in
[1:44:37] the branch is also in the vine it'll be
[1:44:39] a fruit I mean if that first branch
[1:44:41] brought forth that branch out of that
[1:44:43] vine that wrote a book of Acts behind it
[1:44:45] if that branch ever puts forth a vine
[1:44:47] puts forth another branch it'll write
[1:44:49] another book of Acts behind it because
[1:44:51] it's the same life if one of your
[1:44:53] grapevines outs here brings forth blue
[1:44:54] grapes let's pour forth another branch
[1:44:57] it'll bring forth blue grapes same life
[1:45:00] and the Viners of the same one in the
[1:45:02] branches that's why I use the example of
[1:45:03] the first church squeeze came on them
[1:45:05] they overcame it they fulfilled the word
[1:45:08] in their day if that bronze put forth
[1:45:10] that that vine puts forth another branch
[1:45:13] squeeze comes down life and the people
[1:45:15] overcomes it hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:45:19] now it is in a different token message
[1:45:23] he says now when we want eternal life we
[1:45:25] receive a token showing that the price
[1:45:27] has been paid it isn't the blood but
[1:45:29] it's the token of the blood it's the
[1:45:31] life itself I mean he says full
[1:45:33] obedience to the whole Word of God to
[1:45:35] God's entire word will entitle you to
[1:45:37] this token and I said before people now
[1:45:39] have a checklist and their minds but
[1:45:41] then he says now how do you do it Peter
[1:45:44] see it so he's saying how do you do it
[1:45:45] so how do you have full obedience to the
[1:45:46] full word of God I'm glad he answers his
[1:45:48] own question
[1:45:49] Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[1:45:51] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:45:54] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:45:55] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:45:57] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:59] touken I mean for the promises Antion to
[1:46:02] your children then there are far off as
[1:46:03] many as the Lord our God shall call so
[1:46:05] you saying this is how you actually I
[1:46:07] have full obedience to the word and that
[1:46:09] you can receive a token is to repent be
[1:46:11] baptized name Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:46:13] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:46:15] the gift of the Holy Ghost you shall
[1:46:16] receive the token it's that simple
[1:46:21] hallelujah Oh amen is that lovely ye so
[1:46:30] happy how could I not be happy because
[1:46:33] ya get people this big list oh this is
[1:46:36] full of billions of all wanna go he
[1:46:38] answers the question I love all fear
[1:46:41] just to leave right now all worried to
[1:46:44] go just to such an assurance of the
[1:46:46] peace of God to cover us Amen so now if
[1:46:51] I've fulfilled God's requirements I have
[1:46:55] a token I have a short token a full
[1:46:59] repentance holy baptized the name of
[1:47:02] Jesus Christ remember it worked for the
[1:47:04] first church it'll work for the last
[1:47:05] church hallelujah if the medicine worked
[1:47:08] for them I said it before to work for us
[1:47:10] holy a vaccine works for one person work
[1:47:13] for me it was the same vaccine right
[1:47:17] Allu you Amen when we see when when they
[1:47:23] seen that wonderful display the power of
[1:47:25] a resurrection he Peter got up and
[1:47:27] quoted the scripture of Joel and so
[1:47:28] forth
[1:47:29] give the promise of that age ensured the
[1:47:31] requirements of that age had been met in
[1:47:33] Jesus Christ and then he sent back a
[1:47:35] token of his death and that token was
[1:47:37] upon him and he said the token is to you
[1:47:39] and to your children to them that are
[1:47:40] far off even as many as the Lord our God
[1:47:42] shall call we'll have to have this token
[1:47:44] Amen not they ought to have but they
[1:47:46] should have it I mean they shall have it
[1:47:48] they shall receive the Holy Ghost when
[1:47:50] you fully obey the word of god and full
[1:47:52] surrender to it you're entitled to the
[1:47:54] token yes sir obedience not here that
[1:47:56] says Lord Lord but he that doeth the
[1:47:57] will and when we pray we must have the
[1:47:59] token to present with our prayer
[1:48:01] a little amen
[1:48:06] glory glory
[1:48:13] this is hell he says he says the 1953 I
[1:48:17] just I just read a couple of quotes then
[1:48:19] we'll close and God's provided way
[1:48:22] speaking of when the Death Angel is
[1:48:24] about to strike Egypt I can hear him say
[1:48:26] a little later after a while I look
[1:48:28] window little boy does looks these two
[1:48:30] great big black ones moving through the
[1:48:32] year that's death and if there's any
[1:48:34] time that the black wings has struck the
[1:48:36] country today I mean is struck the
[1:48:38] country day we've had earthquakes we've
[1:48:40] had pestilence weather all kinds of
[1:48:42] things that could come to this land and
[1:48:45] on like they did in Egypt but the last
[1:48:47] plague that Egypt before destruction was
[1:48:49] death and the last plague that hits the
[1:48:51] church is spiritual death that's the
[1:48:53] last thing they're dying the churches
[1:48:55] are dying out oh we've had we're having
[1:48:58] protracted meetings but no revival no
[1:49:00] revival they say the great revival in
[1:49:02] America tell me where it's at where it's
[1:49:04] at we've been struck we've even struck
[1:49:07] the first phase of a revival in America
[1:49:10] the reason of it is as we're trying to
[1:49:13] teach me in theology and things instead
[1:49:15] of bringing them back God's provided way
[1:49:17] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:49:19] send them back to God by the way of
[1:49:21] Calvary well we're trying to get them
[1:49:23] into the church and join them into the
[1:49:25] church baptize them into the church
[1:49:26] shake their hands into the church and
[1:49:28] pack their leaders into the church but
[1:49:30] they've got to be born in the Church of
[1:49:32] the Living God that's the reason we
[1:49:34] haven't got no revival so we have a
[1:49:37] pestilence before they had the Spanish
[1:49:39] flu 1918 there was the polio polio
[1:49:43] epidemic 1940 I believe it was there
[1:49:46] with a pestilence before you say well
[1:49:49] this will just be another one it might
[1:49:50] not be I don't want to just say just
[1:49:53] walk on no no this is a time to check up
[1:49:56] this is a time to be sober-minded say
[1:50:00] Lord do I really have what I need to
[1:50:03] have he would say in the Easter seal he
[1:50:07] says remember there's only one hope get
[1:50:09] this quickening power it'll hold you
[1:50:11] when everything else has give away it'll
[1:50:14] hold you some of them said did you keep
[1:50:16] your religion brother branham I said no
[1:50:18] it kept me
[1:50:19] it keeps me I don't keep it
[1:50:22] ain't weather I hold on or not it's
[1:50:24] whether he held on or not he is what
[1:50:27] held on for me he didn't have to and
[1:50:30] he's his angels were sitting every tree
[1:50:31] just pull your finger loose just point
[1:50:33] you don't have to take it from you don't
[1:50:36] have to take it from the cross just
[1:50:37] point your finger and watch what see
[1:50:38] that mocking bunch but if he had did it
[1:50:41] I couldn't
[1:50:44] but but because he stayed on the cross
[1:50:47] he held there and that's why I hold with
[1:50:50] him on Christ the solid rock I stand all
[1:50:52] other ground is sinking sand
[1:50:54] hallelujah so it's not whether I hold on
[1:50:58] that's rather he holds on that is the
[1:51:02] big difference but if you know him you
[1:51:06] know he'll hold on so I want to leave it
[1:51:10] there this morning
[1:51:12] this may be the last service we have in
[1:51:14] this church life might not go on but
[1:51:20] what about you what about you and your
[1:51:23] walk with the Lord do you know him have
[1:51:27] you really I really met him if he's
[1:51:29] alive member before I met the Lord I
[1:51:31] thought well if he's alive the Bible
[1:51:33] says he's alive is resurrected therefore
[1:51:36] I could meet him I'm just a simple guy
[1:51:39] if he says he's alive forevermore well
[1:51:42] where is he I can meet him right I meet
[1:51:46] him it was more than hearing tapes
[1:51:48] brother Graham said you know yo people
[1:51:50] say - he sees in the token but brother
[1:51:52] brim I believe every word you say
[1:51:55] he says that's good but that's just
[1:51:56] being able to read and many people have
[1:51:58] just taken people say you got to believe
[1:52:00] this prophet that's not enough you must
[1:52:02] have the token you must have the Holy
[1:52:04] Ghost I believe the message that's good
[1:52:06] that's just being able to read but you
[1:52:07] must meet the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:52:09] remember the messages you must be born
[1:52:11] again amen
[1:52:14] but if he's here to meet and he still is
[1:52:16] then you could meet him and there
[1:52:20] doesn't matter what happens there could
[1:52:21] be another virus cabina whatever well I
[1:52:24] don't know what your worst-case scenario
[1:52:25] is it could happen but even if it
[1:52:27] happened if you're sealed in the rock of
[1:52:29] ages' if you're sealed until the day of
[1:52:31] your redemption by the Holy Ghost in
[1:52:33] your life it doesn't matter you can just
[1:52:36] have a blessed assurance Jesus is mine
[1:52:37] yeah so let's just bow heads in a word
[1:52:43] of Prayer shall we
[1:52:44] we'll have the musicians to come
[1:52:48] gracious Lord Jesus Lord I'm so thankful
[1:52:54] Lord I just want to pray for each one
[1:52:56] here I asked Lord that if
[1:52:58] one here would truly be sober-minded
[1:53:00] doesn't matter what age we may be we may
[1:53:02] be old we may be young but father I pray
[1:53:05] dear Lord that Lord Jesus I believe that
[1:53:08] this this virus though it may sound
[1:53:10] strange but I believe it's it's your
[1:53:12] grace to the earth in a way because now
[1:53:16] it gets people to really check up what
[1:53:18] would happen if I got it what would
[1:53:19] happen if I died and because Lord we get
[1:53:22] caught up in the busyness of life and
[1:53:23] people have plans of what will happen
[1:53:25] but now our plans have changed Lord
[1:53:28] because the world has changed even if it
[1:53:30] is just temporarily but now lord I pray
[1:53:32] that a soberness will come into our
[1:53:34] hearts Lord Father that we would think
[1:53:37] about think on our ways and think do I
[1:53:39] do I really know you lord have I really
[1:53:41] met you have I really been born again or
[1:53:44] have I just had a church experience just
[1:53:47] go along because others go and or I was
[1:53:50] raising it Lord I pray father you'd move
[1:53:52] on every heart by your Holy Spirit now
[1:53:54] and Lord if there's anyone here who
[1:53:56] doesn't know you Lord Lord I
[1:53:58] unfortunately there's bound to be but
[1:54:00] Lord if there's some who have not really
[1:54:02] given their whole being over to you Lord
[1:54:04] and you've sealed them into the kingdom
[1:54:05] by your Holy Ghost Lord I I pray father
[1:54:08] Lord as your word says as the goodness
[1:54:10] of God that lead us to repentance lon so
[1:54:13] father I spray it Lord I pray you'd
[1:54:15] speak to every heart Lord like only you
[1:54:17] can and Lord those who don't know you
[1:54:20] Lord I pray you just speak to them Lord
[1:54:23] and they just give it all to you Lord
[1:54:25] Jesus you and you would make them new
[1:54:27] creatures a new father Lord it's not a
[1:54:29] it's not a think so that we know you
[1:54:31] Lord it's a no so Lord I pray you give
[1:54:34] such an assurance and D every heart
[1:54:36] father Lord that Lord that their lives
[1:54:39] are hidden away in you Lord may you
[1:54:42] grant a father you know anyone who may
[1:54:44] be watching now or will watch later Lord
[1:54:46] I ask Lord that you'd move on their
[1:54:48] hearts as well
[1:54:49] Lord Jesus may they not bury that
[1:54:51] conviction that that hunger and thirst
[1:54:52] for you and other things but Lord may
[1:54:54] they just fleet you while they can Lord
[1:54:57] we don't know Lord this this may be the
[1:54:59] end but Lord of it's not Lord I don't
[1:55:02] know but if it is Lord may we be ready
[1:55:04] Lord even if or maybe ten more years
[1:55:06] before the rapture goes or now but maybe
[1:55:09] we'll be ready Lord for how that's what
[1:55:11] we want law
[1:55:12] I just pray Lord you take these chopped
[1:55:14] up words this morning and me compel take
[1:55:16] up by your Holy Ghost and compel
[1:55:17] everyone here Lord into that Ark of
