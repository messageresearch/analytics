[31:15] Lord let's just go to if you got your
[31:17] Bibles handy let's go to the chapter
[31:22] we've got a Matthew 24 and we're going
[31:26] to read verses 12 down to verse 21 down
[31:35] to verse 22 of Matthew 24 Matthew 24 and
[31:45] verse 12 this isn't because the Nikoli
[31:46] shall abound the love of many shall wax
[31:48] cold but he that shall endure unto the
[31:51] end the same shall be saved and this
[31:52] gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[31:54] in all the world for a witness unto all
[31:57] nations and then the end shall the in
[32:00] come when ye therefore shall see the
[32:03] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[32:06] Daniel the prophet speaking of the
[32:08] destruction of Jerusalem now stand in
[32:11] the Holy Place whoso readeth let him
[32:13] understand then let him which being
[32:15] Jerusalem flee into the mountains let
[32:17] him which is on the housetop not come
[32:19] down to take anything out of his house
[32:21] neither let him which is in the field
[32:23] return back to take his clothes and woe
[32:26] unto them that are with child and to
[32:28] them which gives suck in those days but
[32:30] pray that ye but pray ye that your
[32:33] flight may not be in the winter neither
[32:34] on the Sabbath day for then shall be
[32:36] Great Tribulation such as such as was
[32:40] not since the beginning of the world to
[32:42] this time nor a no nor ever shall be and
[32:46] except those days be shortened issue
[32:48] should no flesh be saved before the
[32:51] elects sake those days shall be
[32:54] shortened Amen may the Lord blesses word
[32:58] you may have your seats I want to take a
[33:02] a thought where history repeats itself
[33:08] and we actually find a few if you look
[33:12] into the scripture where you know you
[33:15] see brother Branham he will identify
[33:17] himself as you know we know he's the
[33:20] prophet of you're the spirit of Elijah
[33:22] and he'll go back into the Old Testament
[33:25] and say as just as Jezebel comes into
[33:27] power he comes the prophet Elijah out of
[33:29] the wilderness and he identifies the
[33:31] world you know the the system coming to
[33:33] take power in America is that Catholic
[33:35] system coming in through the election of
[33:37] President Kennedy any identifies things
[33:40] that are going on in the world and it's
[33:42] easy to look back in history and say
[33:44] well that is where that he was back
[33:46] there but we must understand from the
[33:49] scripture where we are today because the
[33:52] message did not come to make us
[33:54] historians only it's good to know what
[33:56] God has done you know in the past and
[33:59] what he's doing but what is he going to
[34:00] do in the future where are we in our
[34:02] journey because we need to know where we
[34:04] are
[34:05] wouldn't you agree we need to know where
[34:07] we are in the scripture in our journey
[34:08] and so I want to take if I can from John
[34:12] the Baptist to the destruction of
[34:15] Jerusalem and that span is the same span
[34:19] that we live today where brother Bram
[34:22] says many times that when when the vine
[34:24] puts forth another branch it will
[34:27] produce a book of Acts when that when
[34:29] the vine he is the vine puts forth a
[34:31] bunch of believers it will produce
[34:33] another book of Acts now many times we
[34:36] think of a book of Acts as signs and
[34:38] miracles and wonders and God's children
[34:40] being led and that's exactly what it is
[34:42] but in the book of Acts there is a birth
[34:44] of a Galatian Church there's a birth of
[34:46] a Corinthian church is a birth of an
[34:48] efficient church at this alone in church
[34:50] all of these churches are birthed and
[34:53] formed when the book of Acts is being
[34:56] written and so if we look into the
[34:58] scripture we can look at the
[35:00] characteristics of these churches and
[35:02] then you can see that believers around
[35:05] the world there are message churches or
[35:07] even people that are identified by those
[35:10] churches amen that's why I think maybe
[35:13] this might help some of us because you
[35:15] look at some people who say why
[35:16] they like this why is this church like
[35:18] this what and we shouldn't compare
[35:20] ourselves with ourselves but it helps us
[35:22] understand where people are because it
[35:24] was in the beginning it will be at the
[35:26] end right so now I want to take because
[35:30] the destruction of Jerusalem we are told
[35:33] by history that no believer was caught
[35:36] in the description when Titus besieged
[35:38] the city and any allowed all the Jews to
[35:41] go in during cause it was during
[35:43] Passover time he allowed them to go on
[35:44] and then he took the city and butchered
[35:46] a whole bunch of them and blood rolled
[35:48] out the streets and he burnt the city
[35:49] burned the temple as Jesus said that not
[35:52] one stone would be laid upon another
[35:54] because they burnt the temple and all
[35:56] the gold ran down into the you know the
[35:58] mortar and everything said to dismantle
[35:59] it and you know there was a great
[36:02] destruction but none of the believers
[36:03] were and were caught in the destruction
[36:05] because that because Titus if you look
[36:07] at history he actually besieged
[36:09] Jerusalem three times the first two
[36:11] times he had to lift the siege and deal
[36:13] with some other threat but the third
[36:15] time he came back and he took the city
[36:17] and destroyed it and so when it happened
[36:20] the first time the believers remember
[36:22] what Jesus said and so they fled so this
[36:26] to me now this is just me and fellowship
[36:28] will just have some fellowship tonight
[36:29] you know to me the destruction of
[36:32] Jerusalem is like the world system you
[36:35] know this world being destroyed in the
[36:36] Great Tribulation but all the believers
[36:38] have fled in a rapture we do not get
[36:41] caught in it hallelujah I mean so so
[36:45] between John the Baptist to the
[36:47] destruction of Jerusalem within that
[36:48] span is the book of Acts and all but and
[36:51] also to have a book of actually must
[36:52] have a Pentecost and in order to have a
[36:55] true Pentecost you've got to have a
[36:56] 4-run account that that introduces the
[36:59] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[37:00] the world
[37:01] so we had that in this generation where
[37:03] where we had a prophet come with the
[37:05] spirit of Elijah he identified the Lamb
[37:07] of God which is the true word I meant
[37:10] the true Word of God is the lamb he I
[37:12] did he he took away all the creeds and
[37:15] dogmas because by believing Creed's and
[37:17] dogmas you make the Word of God now
[37:19] fixed to the people but you know Jesus
[37:21] hid by teaching the commandments and
[37:23] doctrines of men you make the Word of
[37:25] God no effect so if you teach the true
[37:27] Word of God you make the word of effect
[37:30] what is the effect now God Himself comes
[37:32] and dwells in a people I mean all their
[37:35] sins are washed away they get made into
[37:37] his image amen they overcome the enemy
[37:39] they trade on serpents and all the works
[37:41] of Satan they have dominion over them
[37:43] they have dominion over their own flesh
[37:45] hallelujah so you know that is the power
[37:48] of the truth of the work will give you
[37:50] overcoming power I mean the enemy will
[37:53] be under your feet hallelujah we're not
[37:55] a beaten you're a bunch of people but we
[37:57] know who we are I mean but if we can see
[38:00] ourselves in the scripture it gives us I
[38:02] believe faith
[38:03] I mean stabilizes our walk if we can
[38:05] understand where we are and so now so we
[38:08] had a four-runner come and he was
[38:11] baptizing people in the high river and
[38:13] up there the pillar of fire came down as
[38:15] it is John the Baptist first run the
[38:17] first coming of Christ your message will
[38:19] forerun the second coming and then it
[38:21] comes down to his ministry the opening
[38:23] of the seals which is more than false
[38:26] writers and tribulation but it's
[38:27] Redemption being revealed it's a lamb
[38:29] stepping forth
[38:30] I trust you see it when you're here the
[38:32] first time I heard the seals I saw horse
[38:34] riders I saw a tribulation I saw you
[38:37] know the souls under the altar eyes but
[38:39] the second time I just saw him
[38:41] hallelujah I saw the lamb stepping forth
[38:43] to claim me hallelujah trust I trust you
[38:47] see beyond symbols and you see the
[38:48] reality of the whole thing and so he
[38:51] says in the seventh seal message he says
[38:53] now I might just be laying a platform
[38:55] for that great weight great one to come
[38:58] and mean with their ambition willing to
[39:01] build kingdoms upon the earth say Here I
[39:03] am
[39:04] but but the great one he's building the
[39:07] platform for as Jesus Christ himself
[39:09] Jesus Christ and word form and so he
[39:12] introduced he pointed us to our
[39:14] bridegroom he introduced us to our
[39:16] bridegroom hallelujah and then now
[39:19] brother Bram says that the end time
[39:22] message releases the Holy Ghost upon the
[39:25] people because the Holy Ghost was bound
[39:27] by superstition tradition and the
[39:29] deductions of men it was bound to the
[39:31] chest or her head had no power to move
[39:33] because the people were believing a lie
[39:35] of man and seed of the true Word of God
[39:37] I mean so by getting rid of the false
[39:41] that's why Sunday God moved I mean
[39:43] that's why
[39:44] yo wherever believers are God comes down
[39:46] it's not a it's not a hit-and-miss
[39:49] affair amen you ought to be thankful for
[39:52] God's restoration in the cell and where
[39:55] God comes in reality where we just don't
[39:57] read the book of Acts and say wasn't
[39:59] that wonderful we say hey that just
[40:01] happened the other day hallelujah to me
[40:04] hallelujah
[40:05] and so now sorry says that the entire
[40:08] message releases the Holy Ghost so we
[40:10] have come back to a true Pentecost amen
[40:14] message wasn't to take us back to Azusa
[40:16] Street there was a restoration of the
[40:18] gifts and we thank God for it I mean but
[40:20] it's true take us back to a true
[40:22] Pentecost where God would dwell and man
[40:24] once again and then what you see in the
[40:26] book of acts of God leading his church
[40:28] it would it would continue that way
[40:30] hallelujah now in the book of Acts we we
[40:35] go to X chapter 19 and I'm just going to
[40:39] skip over Paul's calling because but we
[40:42] understand Paul's calling is exactly
[40:44] like your calling I trust he's come to
[40:47] you he's come to you when you wanted to
[40:50] live some kind of other life he came to
[40:52] you Paul had a life he had his life
[40:55] mapped out I'm a Pharisee of the
[40:56] Pharisees I'm going to climb this ivory
[40:58] tower of religion he had his ideas I'm
[41:02] going to destroy this thing I think God
[41:04] came to him amen and he saw he saw
[41:07] Hawaii Lord I'm Jesus whom you persecute
[41:09] or that really not the I don't know
[41:13] whatever out of him hallelujah I trust
[41:16] he's come to you like that maybe not in
[41:19] a visible light but he's spoken to you
[41:20] and you let and you laid your life down
[41:23] I mean so now he was called down in the
[41:27] book of Acts we have a we have people
[41:29] that have never we have people that
[41:32] preach that Jesus is the Christ from the
[41:34] scripture but they have no idea of what
[41:36] God has done in their day they're still
[41:38] walking in the past and so he comes and
[41:41] he and he finds the paulus and some of
[41:43] them they were they were they were
[41:47] preaching that Jesus was the Christ but
[41:49] they only knew the baptism of John so
[41:52] there are believers that's why people in
[41:54] denomination you know don't don't just
[41:57] don't just right
[41:58] them off there might be some of policies
[42:00] in there who are living by the light of
[42:02] a former age they just maybe haven't
[42:04] heard yet
[42:06] Amen you with me he didn't hear that's
[42:09] amazing because Paul when he found them
[42:12] he goes straight to have you received
[42:14] the Holy Ghost since you've believed as
[42:15] God a living reality more than an
[42:18] anointing but in reality and and then it
[42:21] says in acts 19 and 2 he says have you
[42:24] received the Holy Ghost since you
[42:25] believed and they say we we haven't even
[42:28] heard if there is a Holy Ghost and the
[42:31] impulses or what baptize what baptism we
[42:33] baptize with this is a first three and
[42:36] then four and then they said well John's
[42:38] baptism and Paul said no God's moved on
[42:42] you got to go from just being baptized
[42:45] by the forerunner you be baptized in the
[42:47] one who was crucified for you and when
[42:50] they did it says the Holy Ghost fell
[42:51] upon them and they received it like they
[42:53] did in the book of Acts I mean yo yo
[42:55] you're on the day of Pentecost amen so
[42:58] there's people now who are who are
[43:00] walking informal light but they have to
[43:03] come into the present truth that's why
[43:05] Peter said be established in the present
[43:07] truth so we have them now if I don't hit
[43:11] them all you'll see cuz even the
[43:13] Ephesian Church had something against
[43:14] them even though that's the model Church
[43:17] but they had husbands love your wives
[43:19] wives love your husband's you know they
[43:23] got so deepened mysteries and certain
[43:25] things they forgot to have a love family
[43:27] like what church you know lujah amen
[43:33] let's go to the book of let's go to the
[43:36] book of Hebrews we're just gonna he's
[43:38] going to go through a few of them now
[43:41] actually before we go there I want to
[43:43] lay out a principle forgot a Deuteronomy
[43:45] chapter 29 we have a principle here
[43:54] Deuteronomy 29 verses one down to verse
[43:58] four you know God can do incredible
[44:00] things but it doesn't always mean that
[44:04] we catch what he's saying then and there
[44:06] people would sit in Brenham tabernacle
[44:08] and they didn't catch what was going on
[44:10] they were looking for the
[44:12] they're looking for gifts that God was
[44:14] revealing himself in his word brother
[44:16] branham would ask Billy Paul after
[44:18] preaching the future home did you catch
[44:20] it
[44:20] he said yeah dad daddy said did you
[44:22] catch it no they didn't understand what
[44:23] he said he says only years later he
[44:26] begin to understand and it's exactly
[44:28] here like in Deuteronomy 29 and verse 1
[44:32] these are the words now remember I'll
[44:34] just read it these are the words of the
[44:36] Covenant which the LORD commanded Moses
[44:38] to make with the children of Israel in
[44:39] the land of Moab beside the Covenant
[44:42] which he made with them in Horeb and
[44:43] Moses called unto all Israel and said
[44:46] unto them ye have seen all the Lord did
[44:48] before your eyes in the land of Egypt
[44:50] under Pharaoh and unto all of his
[44:52] servants and unto all his land the great
[44:54] temptations which thine eyes seen the
[44:57] signs and those great miracles but look
[45:00] at this yet the Lord hath not given you
[45:03] a heart to perceive and eyes to see and
[45:06] ears to hear unto this day
[45:09] they had been there in Egypt they had
[45:13] seen the plagues I had seen the Passover
[45:15] it walked through the Red Sea there at
[45:18] Sinai they'd been there 40 years in the
[45:21] world of it but they've seen incredible
[45:22] things be it now he says now the Lord is
[45:25] actually showing you what's going on and
[45:27] this is a principle because if we're
[45:32] honest we we don't understand everything
[45:34] that's been revealed you know not one of
[45:37] us could even sit down and touch the
[45:38] sides of what's contained in here you
[45:41] know if you're asked to explain it well
[45:44] we don't fully because it's not fully
[45:45] revealed we could maybe read it or
[45:47] listen to it but to have the river of
[45:49] what it contains we don't have the
[45:52] fullness of it because as we walk with
[45:54] him he reveals himself and first john 1
[45:57] and 7 it says but as we walk in the
[45:59] light as he is in the light we have
[46:00] fellowship one with another us in God
[46:01] and the blood of Jesus Christ his sake
[46:04] cleanse us from all sin so you must walk
[46:06] with Him in his word in the light as he
[46:08] is in the light and you have fellowship
[46:11] and it reveals himself so we see that
[46:18] today as well people people get an idea
[46:22] that everyone understands has the same
[46:25] amount of revelation
[46:25] everyone else but we are Jesus gave the
[46:29] parable of the wheat and the tares but I
[46:32] believe we're wheat tonight by His grace
[46:35] if you look at a wheat field that
[46:37] doesn't grow all the same you know these
[46:39] some parts of the golden some parts are
[46:41] still green some parts are you know it's
[46:44] like any natural plant that grows at
[46:45] different speeds one plant to another
[46:47] but when the harvest comes it's already
[46:51] so something may not be real to me but
[46:54] it might be real to you you know you
[46:57] might be more mature than I am but at
[46:59] least if there's life I'm growing amen
[47:02] and that's the same with all of us as
[47:04] long as life is there his life amen as
[47:07] we walk with Him we will mature will
[47:10] become more golden and so it's the same
[47:13] thing around the world people are still
[47:15] growing and maturing and the reason that
[47:18] the rapture hasn't gone is one everyone
[47:20] hasn't come in yet into we're not mature
[47:21] whatever God calls maturity now what we
[47:27] have as well if you know if you look at
[47:29] you'd say history as we read that
[47:31] scripture in Deuteronomy you and Ben
[47:33] give a nice to see your heart a
[47:34] perceiver is to heat all this day so
[47:37] that principle is that something may be
[47:40] open to me but something may not be open
[47:44] to someone else or vice-versa so for
[47:47] example if we read the book of Hebrews
[47:49] let's go to Hebrews 6 and 1 now there is
[47:53] two parts - I won't say redemption well
[47:59] there is two parts to redemption but
[48:01] there's two parts to an exodus it's a
[48:04] coming out and these are going in so in
[48:07] the first excess they had to come out of
[48:09] Egypt for their to go into the Promised
[48:11] Land the second Exodus coming out of the
[48:13] out of the law and traditions of man
[48:16] they had to come out then they're to go
[48:18] into Christ and so Paul and it's the
[48:21] same thing in the third Exodus we came
[48:23] out of the world we came out of
[48:25] religions of men wherever we came out of
[48:27] we came out of something but then we
[48:30] couldn't just come out we had to go in
[48:32] right and so it's just it just room
[48:37] history repeats itself so
[48:39] come out of something but we have to go
[48:41] into Christ
[48:42] now the Hebrew church had come out for
[48:46] the head and garden and Hebrew you know
[48:49] the book of Hebrews to me is it's a
[48:52] great book because the Hebrew people as
[48:56] the light was rising to the Gentiles the
[49:00] Gentiles were coming in blindness was
[49:03] falling upon the Hebrews and Paul was
[49:06] standing here during this overlapped
[49:08] time of the Hebrews being blinded for
[49:10] our sakes and the door opening to the
[49:11] Gentiles and he kept contrasting that
[49:15] the blood of Jesus Christ is greater
[49:16] than the blood of bulls and goats that
[49:18] the priesthood of Melchizedek is greater
[49:21] than the priesthood of Aaron he
[49:23] contrasts all the time and he speaks
[49:26] about let us go let us go unto rest you
[49:30] know just like Moses brought the people
[49:32] out of Egypt and they had to enter into
[49:33] the Promised Land and that was there
[49:35] less rest he says let us labor therefore
[49:37] to enter into that rest so it's calling
[49:40] him to leave from one place go to
[49:41] another place even though they believe
[49:44] that Jesus Christ was the Messiah and
[49:46] then he says Hebrew six and one he says
[49:50] therefore leaving the principles of the
[49:54] doctrine of Christ let us let us go unto
[49:57] perfection not laying again the
[50:00] foundation of repentance from dead works
[50:02] and of faith towards God and of the
[50:05] doctrine of baptisms and of the laying
[50:07] on of hands and of the resurrection of
[50:09] the Dead and eternal judgment and this
[50:12] we do if God permit so he's so this -
[50:17] this foundation he's not saying let's
[50:20] throw it away he says let us leave go
[50:23] from us and go to another so let us know
[50:26] the Foundation's been laid but let's
[50:28] build the house a a following me so he's
[50:32] not saying throw it away he says let us
[50:34] go unto perfection or their perfection
[50:36] is maturity let us grow from here and
[50:39] grow to the force of the stature of
[50:41] Christ and now and then you come into
[50:47] this day where some people say just stay
[50:49] with the simple gospel now this may be
[50:52] rather inflamed
[50:53] turi statements if people see this but I
[50:55] trust to hear the whole thing and they
[50:56] take it in the right spirit but you know
[50:58] some people say just stay with the
[51:00] simple gospel a cure X X 2:38 stay with
[51:05] that and one God and water baptism and
[51:07] and dressing right and you know those
[51:09] just stay with the simple gospel but
[51:12] we're not called just to stay with those
[51:14] things we're called to grow from those
[51:17] things we don't neglect those things
[51:19] look they say here you know of
[51:21] repentance from dead works and of faith
[51:23] towards God amen we've all we've all had
[51:27] to come from that stage where it's not
[51:29] our righteousness it's not Arabic it's
[51:31] not what we do amen but it's faith
[51:33] towards God because faith your faith in
[51:37] the word causes it to come to pass in
[51:39] our lives right amen and abduction of
[51:43] baptisms we've all been preaching about
[51:45] baptism them Lord Jesus Christ it's a
[51:47] fundamental because into unit the
[51:49] straight cake Jesus says and that gate
[51:51] Matthew chapter 7 that's STR AIT which
[51:55] is a narrow passage of water he says
[51:57] into unit that gate for Strait is the
[52:00] gate and narrow is the way so repent we
[52:02] baptize them Lord Jesus Christ you enter
[52:04] into the gate you enter through the gate
[52:06] then there's a narrow walk and of laying
[52:10] on of hands that's divine healing will
[52:12] believe that do we know and of the
[52:14] resurrection of the Dead we believe that
[52:16] do we not amen and of eternal judgment
[52:20] these are fundamentals and in the word
[52:23] but he's saying let's go from those
[52:25] things but these people better have been
[52:29] called out for they haven't gone in
[52:31] right so so we have the Hebrews here now
[52:39] let's go to Thessalonians
[52:40] let's go to second Thessalonians
[52:54] I can find it
[53:01] Timothy Thessalonians Timothy Titus
[53:06] actually here there's Colossians there
[53:13] we go I'm glad someone's awake now it's
[53:18] isn't it so the the Thistle oh the the
[53:20] church at Thessalonica they were
[53:22] troubled by things he says in
[53:25] Thessalonians 1 and I make very sick and
[53:28] Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 1 now we
[53:31] beseech you brethren by the coming of
[53:34] our Lord Jesus and by our gathering
[53:36] together unto Him see they had gathered
[53:38] to him and we've gathered to him that ye
[53:41] be not soon shaken in mind or troubled
[53:44] neither by spirit nor by word nor by
[53:47] letter as from us as that day the day of
[53:52] Christ is at hand let no man deceive you
[53:55] by any means for that they should not
[53:56] come except there come a falling away
[53:58] first and that man of sin be revealed
[54:00] the son of perdition sorry so these
[54:04] people were troubled they are being
[54:06] shaken he's saying don't be troubled by
[54:08] these things saying that the day of
[54:11] Christ is at hand now there's some
[54:14] there's also those in the New Testament
[54:16] that were preaching that the
[54:17] resurrection had already happened
[54:18] and then you come down into this day and
[54:22] there's people that believe that were in
[54:23] the Millennium so we've had the
[54:24] resurrection the righteous already
[54:25] happen ember in the Millennium so what
[54:29] was in the up what was here in the and
[54:31] the epistles has repeated itself we're
[54:34] there people walking around saying the
[54:35] resurrection has already come it's
[54:36] already been done and people hearing
[54:38] them people within the message drum say
[54:40] you know we're in the Millennium what
[54:43] two souls were in a new body and all
[54:44] these different things and the raptures
[54:46] already happened well what is it don't
[54:49] be shaken by it a few if you come across
[54:51] it it's in the scripture it has to be
[54:53] here because it was in the beginning so
[54:56] it will be at the end and these ones
[55:00] were troubled house us you know people
[55:02] saying that they've Christ is happy says
[55:03] no these things have to be first and
[55:06] then it's gonna be here so don't be
[55:08] troubled and you see people get troubled
[55:11] are you following me maybe you're
[55:14] thinking quite deeply
[55:15] they went listening very intently and
[55:19] then now we have let's go to the this is
[55:23] in no particular order but then you have
[55:24] the Corinthian church now the Corinthian
[55:28] church was a very carnal Church but they
[55:32] were believers remember all these people
[55:34] are believers these are all message
[55:35] people right they they were following
[55:38] the message of their day they will
[55:40] believe us so we're not throwing them
[55:41] out they'll be there like we'll be there
[55:43] it's just like the yes just like the
[55:46] Apostle Peter you read about Acts
[55:49] chapter 15 he starts to be influenced by
[55:51] people trying to bring Judaism into
[55:53] Christianity and he began to separate
[55:56] himself from Gentile believers have you
[55:59] read that he has influenced by certain
[56:01] things but then when Paul came along
[56:03] they had fellowship about these things
[56:04] he saw the error of his ways and he went
[56:06] back into the middle again doesn't mean
[56:08] he wasn't a true apostle but we can be
[56:11] influenced by certain things in lean
[56:12] ways that we necessary shouldn't link so
[56:17] now the Corinthian church they were a
[56:20] cattle church they were a liberal Church
[56:25] now we see the cannelli
[56:27] in Corinthians 1 and 11 and to me the
[56:33] book of Corinthians is like the time of
[56:34] Judges every man did that which was
[56:37] right in his own eyes
[56:38] so they and so what does that mean it
[56:41] basically means everything I do is as is
[56:44] God's perfect will and I can do what I
[56:46] want everything that every man does that
[56:48] which is right in his own eyes but
[56:51] that's not true
[56:52] now a season 1st Corinthians 1:11 for it
[56:55] hath been declared unto me of you my
[56:57] brethren by them which are the house of
[57:00] Chloe that there are contentions among
[57:02] you see now now this I say that every
[57:07] one of you say if I'm of Paul I'm of
[57:10] Apollo's I'm of Cephas I'm of Christ as
[57:13] Christ divided was Paul crucified for
[57:17] you or you baptize in the name of Paul I
[57:19] thank God that I baptized none of you
[57:22] but but Crispus and Gaius least any
[57:26] should say that I had baptized in my own
[57:29] and are baptized also the household of
[57:31] of stefania's besides i know not whether
[57:34] i baptized any other for christ sent me
[57:37] not to baptize but to preach the gospel
[57:39] not with wisdom of words lest the cross
[57:41] of Christ should be made of none effect
[57:44] now the now the ministries of Paul
[57:49] himself of Paulus Cephas they were God
[57:53] sent ministries the Canela T the
[57:56] believers gathered around these
[57:59] ministries where they would Connelly say
[58:02] this ministries this ministry and this
[58:05] one is not as good as this one
[58:06] these all had these were all I imagined
[58:10] they had different temperaments they had
[58:12] different gifts in the body so Connolly
[58:15] one preferred one above the other but if
[58:18] they were spiritual about it they'd
[58:19] understand that this God is a God of
[58:22] variety and he seen some fossils and
[58:24] some of prophets and some teachers and
[58:26] evangelists and pastors and they're all
[58:28] built differently and so but Connelly
[58:31] they begin to gather around the humanity
[58:34] of ministry even though but it wasn't
[58:37] the ministry causing this it was the
[58:39] carnality of the people and then where
[58:41] you missed out the I'm of Christ well
[58:44] what does that mean I don't need anyone
[58:45] to teach me I don't need to go to church
[58:47] I just listen to tapes I bring into
[58:49] today's language that's of Christ okay
[58:52] you're following me thus far so all of
[58:56] these things are still here but I
[58:59] believe we're living in a day an hour we
[59:01] are gathering around human you know the
[59:04] human what he call it the nature of a
[59:07] ministry has come to an end I mean but
[59:10] we can take any ministry that God has
[59:12] seen and we can appreciate it for what
[59:14] it is and see how it's all part of the
[59:16] body I mean for our benefit I mean I
[59:20] trust you can see it that way amen
[59:24] and then also now these ones allowed sin
[59:32] just to be rampant in the church
[59:36] 1st Corinthians 5 and 1 because remember
[59:40] I said there are a liberal Church
[59:41] they're liberal churches
[59:43] it is reported commonly that there is
[59:45] fornication among you and such occasion
[59:48] is not as so such as named among the
[59:50] Gentiles that one should have his
[59:52] father's wife and year puffed up and
[59:55] have not rather mourned that he that
[59:57] hath done this deed might be taken away
[1:00:00] from among you so they just it's been
[1:00:03] commonly it's been reported commonly to
[1:00:07] this fornication among you said wasn't a
[1:00:09] secret it was actually knowing it was
[1:00:12] just there see liberal Church they you
[1:00:14] know they didn't grieve over the sin
[1:00:15] that had gone and instead this person
[1:00:17] they just they just let it happen
[1:00:20] see you say well liberalism's and you
[1:00:23] think no it's an old thing because in
[1:00:25] the first stage it's here at the end
[1:00:27] amen and so we have the Corinthians here
[1:00:35] what church you you so you might say
[1:00:39] just put it down what church are we
[1:00:40] I trust we're a word Church that's
[1:00:44] balanced amen I remember the Corinthians
[1:00:47] were believers
[1:00:48] you read seeking Corinthians that sees
[1:00:50] that the man that was doing that
[1:00:51] repented and he was still in the faith
[1:00:55] now we have the Galatian Church it's got
[1:00:59] the book of Galatians that we doing for
[1:01:03] time right now collation Church now the
[1:01:07] Galatians do we know he you know the
[1:01:12] Apostle Paul I remember the Galatians
[1:01:15] wasn't just one Church it was to the
[1:01:18] churches of Galatia such there was
[1:01:20] actually a group of churches in an area
[1:01:23] now we got verse six of Galatians
[1:01:26] chapter one it says I marvel that ye are
[1:01:28] so soon removed from him that called you
[1:01:31] under grace unto the grace of Christ
[1:01:33] unto another gospel which is not another
[1:01:36] but there be some that trouble you and
[1:01:39] would pervert the gospel of Christ but
[1:01:42] though we or an angel from heaven preach
[1:01:43] any other gospel unto you that which we
[1:01:46] have preached unto you let him be
[1:01:47] accursed and we say as we said before so
[1:01:51] I say now again if any man preach any
[1:01:53] other gospel unto you than that ye have
[1:01:55] received
[1:01:56] let him be accursed for do I now
[1:01:59] persuade men or God or do I seek to
[1:02:01] please men for if I yet pleased men I
[1:02:04] should not be the servant of Christ but
[1:02:07] I certify you brethren that the gospel
[1:02:08] which was preached of me is not after
[1:02:10] man for neither I received it of man
[1:02:12] neither was I taught it but by the
[1:02:14] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:15] and then he begins to pulp against aloud
[1:02:18] his experience now Paul went straight to
[1:02:23] the course of the matter they say that
[1:02:24] that the Galatians have brought in
[1:02:29] things that were not in the message and
[1:02:31] it was the influence of a previous age
[1:02:35] that influenced them and it was the Jew
[1:02:38] the law
[1:02:39] yo it was the believers of the Old
[1:02:42] Testament law had come in they meant we
[1:02:48] will read the book of Galatians this may
[1:02:50] be seen for elementary but it was it was
[1:02:52] the light of a previous age had affected
[1:02:55] them in such a way that they weren't
[1:02:56] walking in the truth anymore but they
[1:02:58] had mixed it now with what the Old
[1:03:00] Testament was saying to do but they had
[1:03:02] been released from that and they mean to
[1:03:04] be walking with with the Lord and so he
[1:03:08] says I'm I believe she be be so soon
[1:03:11] removed from him that called you into
[1:03:12] the grace of Christ so so here's now so
[1:03:15] why do you say light of a former age
[1:03:17] I'll put it into today's language people
[1:03:20] are influenced by Pentecost and a bad
[1:03:23] way in in the wrong way and brother MC
[1:03:25] is that the Pentecost will move they
[1:03:27] were good legalists Peter Kostas good
[1:03:30] legalists have you heard him saying it
[1:03:33] so people now people bring legalism into
[1:03:36] the message and they make people
[1:03:38] outwardly conform and wear their clothes
[1:03:42] certain lengths right you know like some
[1:03:45] people say women have got to have long
[1:03:47] sleeves and the girl and the dresses are
[1:03:48] going to be scraping the floor well
[1:03:50] that's not exactly what brother Brown
[1:03:52] said as long as the skirt goes goes
[1:03:55] under the knee you're looking at me like
[1:03:58] what are you talking about right but
[1:04:02] some people say no it has to be this way
[1:04:03] otherwise you're not a believer well
[1:04:06] what is that that's just adding actually
[1:04:07] to the word
[1:04:09] it's adding to the wood just like the
[1:04:10] Galatians did but it looks so much
[1:04:13] better just like you know if the if we
[1:04:16] win and we compared like many people say
[1:04:18] oh I'm the Muslim so devout how they
[1:04:20] pray so much they do all the same to do
[1:04:22] the outwardly it looks very religious
[1:04:24] but there's no reality to it and you
[1:04:27] bring it right way close to the truth
[1:04:29] that you say are these people who dress
[1:04:31] so holy and they look so pious but is
[1:04:33] there a life being produced what is
[1:04:35] their ultimate as it oh look my I dress
[1:04:38] a certain way therefore I'm going in a
[1:04:40] rapture no it shouldn't be long here
[1:04:42] long dresses long faces many people like
[1:04:45] that there's nothing wrong with long
[1:04:47] hair long dresses but shouldn't be long
[1:04:49] faces I do this because I have to and I
[1:04:51] get Bureau that should be out of a love
[1:04:54] amen so now and then he begins to Paul
[1:05:01] you know he begins to show them now it
[1:05:05] is not he's isn't Galatians three and
[1:05:07] one Oh foolish Galatians who hath
[1:05:09] bewitched you that you should not obey
[1:05:11] the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[1:05:13] has been evidently set forth crucified
[1:05:15] among you
[1:05:16] this only what I learned have you
[1:05:18] received you the spirit by the works of
[1:05:21] the law or by the hearing of faith how
[1:05:24] did you receive it because they didn't
[1:05:26] receive it by the works of the law but
[1:05:28] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:05:30] Word of God and when faith is conceived
[1:05:32] in the heart then it produces the word
[1:05:34] amen
[1:05:35] are you so foolish having begun in the
[1:05:37] spirit that you are now made perfect by
[1:05:40] the flesh amen and people get very rigid
[1:05:44] and this is how things you have to be we
[1:05:45] have to have everything perfect and you
[1:05:47] know and they make it their major and
[1:05:50] that is it and they're justified by the
[1:05:54] works of the flesh these people are here
[1:05:58] what are we so it's easy to say all that
[1:06:01] persons like this but at reality you
[1:06:03] shouldn't be so this is just I want to
[1:06:05] say these things to maybe give a bit of
[1:06:07] stability you can understand every
[1:06:09] condition of the churches and the New
[1:06:11] Testament are here today now it doesn't
[1:06:15] mean they're not believers and you know
[1:06:16] you know but people it's like if you're
[1:06:20] you know brother Bram says if someone's
[1:06:22] very scholarly
[1:06:23] and they don't keep it under prayer
[1:06:24] they'll become very dogmatic and very
[1:06:26] you know if you're built a certain way
[1:06:28] if you're very emotional kind of person
[1:06:30] if you don't keep it under the pre and
[1:06:31] go off into just purely sensations and
[1:06:34] emotions or if you're very scholarly you
[1:06:36] can you can be pushed the other way and
[1:06:37] you're just very dogmatic and rigid and
[1:06:39] your understanding so you've got a you
[1:06:43] got to keep your even your your own
[1:06:45] nature that it will try and push you one
[1:06:46] way or another and the thing that
[1:06:49] influences you becomes your absolute
[1:06:50] because you begin to live according to
[1:06:53] this thing that's like a you know like a
[1:06:55] like a young man and and and someone in
[1:06:57] his life yes yes oh you'll never just
[1:07:00] like summer oh you'll never be an
[1:07:01] astronaut and the little kid goes I'll
[1:07:03] show you you know well yeah and he
[1:07:06] becomes national why did he do that he
[1:07:08] says I'm going to prove to that one you
[1:07:10] know I'm gonna prove to him I'm gonna be
[1:07:11] an astronaut well who becomes absolute
[1:07:13] the guy says you'll never be that and
[1:07:15] they start to live before that person's
[1:07:18] comment amen and so we have to by God's
[1:07:24] grace not lean to the left or right but
[1:07:27] walk straight down the middle and so the
[1:07:30] galatians are here the hebrews are here
[1:07:34] the Ephesians are here too now our
[1:07:39] brother Bram says at the Ephesian Church
[1:07:40] they weren't they weren't carnal like
[1:07:43] the Corinthians everything was out of
[1:07:45] order but they these people were
[1:07:48] spiritual people and he could really
[1:07:49] teach them deep things but we read it
[1:07:53] and notice how he begins to speak in
[1:07:56] Ephesians 5 where he says wives submit
[1:08:00] yourselves unto your own husband's unto
[1:08:02] the Lord even as the husband as the head
[1:08:04] of the wife even as Christ as the head
[1:08:05] of the church and he is the savior of
[1:08:07] the body therefore as the church is
[1:08:08] subject unto Christ so let wives be to
[1:08:11] their own husbands and everything
[1:08:12] husbands love your wives even Christ
[1:08:14] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:08:16] for it that he might sanctify and
[1:08:18] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[1:08:19] by the word that he might present it to
[1:08:21] himself a glorious church not having
[1:08:23] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[1:08:25] that it should be holy and without
[1:08:28] blemish so ought men to love their wives
[1:08:30] as their own bodies he that loveth his
[1:08:32] wife loveth himself for no man ever yet
[1:08:35] hated his own flesh but
[1:08:36] nourishes cherishes that even as the
[1:08:39] Lord the church for we are members of
[1:08:42] his body of his flesh of his bones for
[1:08:44] this cause shall a man leave his father
[1:08:46] and his mother and shall be joined unto
[1:08:47] his wife and they too shall be one flesh
[1:08:50] this is a great mystery but I speak
[1:08:52] concerning Christ in the church
[1:08:54] now nevertheless that every one of you
[1:08:57] in particular so love his wife even of
[1:08:58] himself and the wife see that she
[1:09:00] reverence her husband so these ones that
[1:09:03] got so deep in mysteries they had
[1:09:06] forgotten was like - actually these
[1:09:08] mysteries that they had received it has
[1:09:10] to actually work out in your life so if
[1:09:13] God has redeemed us husbands now if he
[1:09:16] has redeemed us then then redemption
[1:09:18] will be lived out through us now not the
[1:09:21] saving of our you know we do we don't
[1:09:23] die for our family but redemption is to
[1:09:26] redeem that and place it back to where
[1:09:28] it should be right that is redemption
[1:09:31] you claim you redeem it you you lay
[1:09:33] claim on what is fallen and you lift it
[1:09:35] back up to where it should be and so
[1:09:37] redemption should be lived out from the
[1:09:39] husband down into the family where it's
[1:09:41] not and and we'll read about it in 1st
[1:09:44] or 2nd Peter where he says that they the
[1:09:47] husband and wife adjoint is together so
[1:09:50] and the Old Testament it was the Jewish
[1:09:53] woman were second-class citizens to the
[1:09:55] mean they were seeing in class but but
[1:09:59] in the New Testament and that is showing
[1:10:01] now under the law the church is a
[1:10:03] singing class citizen to Christ I mean
[1:10:05] to God but by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:08] we are lifted up to be joint heirs with
[1:10:10] Christ that is what we are and says we
[1:10:12] are joint heirs with him were a he is
[1:10:14] our head but he's lifted us up to where
[1:10:16] he is Alleluia and so now a man who's
[1:10:21] under the law still down choices family
[1:10:24] downtrod says his wife amen
[1:10:28] that's what you you see it even though
[1:10:30] they say hallelujah I mean while being
[1:10:33] redeemed and you know the grace of God
[1:10:35] has come into my life you know if
[1:10:37] they're either leaning the wrong way or
[1:10:39] they're actually still under the law and
[1:10:40] try and do it in their own strength
[1:10:41] their family will be downtrodden but if
[1:10:44] God is really does if God himself has
[1:10:46] stepped into that vessel I mean all
[1:10:49] their heart will be I want to lift
[1:10:51] amen that where I am they'll be joining
[1:10:53] us with me
[1:10:55] that's why Redemption has to be actually
[1:10:58] he say I am redeemed well let's see it
[1:11:00] in your life because what will you want
[1:11:03] to do you don't want to see your even
[1:11:04] your brother and sister yo people who
[1:11:06] look down their nose or this person will
[1:11:08] never get there and this person still
[1:11:10] you know they're still battling with
[1:11:12] this and they'll never grow from parthis
[1:11:13] you know their person they need to come
[1:11:15] to the altar themselves I mean because
[1:11:17] if Christ is in the heart of the
[1:11:19] believer they'll want to say come up
[1:11:21] here where I am I mean don't kick people
[1:11:23] down or try to climb up help them up
[1:11:25] that's what we should do and so your
[1:11:29] Redemption should be should be
[1:11:31] manifested at us Allu you and then he
[1:11:35] talks about children obey your parents
[1:11:36] in the Lord for this is right and then
[1:11:39] and then he keeps and then honor thy
[1:11:42] father and mother which is the first
[1:11:43] commandment with promise that it may be
[1:11:45] well with thee although children do you
[1:11:47] want it to be well with you amen
[1:11:51] that thou mayest live long on the earth
[1:11:53] and ye father's provoke not your
[1:11:54] children to wrath but bring them up in
[1:11:57] the nurture and admonition of the Lord
[1:11:58] so he's talking about general family
[1:12:01] things waste trying to say you have to
[1:12:04] you know don't just be caught up in all
[1:12:06] these mysteries and forget your family
[1:12:07] you know it's like Joseph and Mary they
[1:12:10] went to Jerusalem they took Jesus they
[1:12:12] want 10 or 12 year-old boy they go to
[1:12:15] the feast I have a glorious time and
[1:12:18] they journey back home three days and
[1:12:20] they say where is he gone they left them
[1:12:23] behind somewhere as the same thing now
[1:12:25] you know many parents we can just get
[1:12:27] caught up and how glorious God is and
[1:12:30] then we around or where our children go
[1:12:32] on you got to bring them with you bring
[1:12:36] them with you whatever you do you say
[1:12:38] well they just little they won't
[1:12:41] understand too much I tell you what if
[1:12:42] the if the message if you can convey it
[1:12:45] down to them I tell you you'll be
[1:12:47] blessed but you'll be more blessing them
[1:12:48] if you can break it down into its real
[1:12:51] just simplicity hallelujah you'll be
[1:12:54] having a more glorious time than they
[1:12:56] know I think you know so sometimes I'll
[1:12:58] read the children's Bible I think I
[1:13:00] enjoy it more than my girls hallelujah I
[1:13:02] mean I love it
[1:13:05] hallelujah man and then now it's good I
[1:13:09] did mention it but we'll just go to
[1:13:11] Peter here because Peter is speaking to
[1:13:14] believers as well any season and our
[1:13:19] closes with first Peter three and one he
[1:13:22] says likewise he husband's dwell dwell
[1:13:27] with them according to knowledge which
[1:13:29] is understanding giving honor unto the
[1:13:32] wife as unto the weaker vessel and as
[1:13:34] being heirs together of the grace of
[1:13:36] life that your prayers be not hindered
[1:13:40] so saying you need to know how to dwell
[1:13:43] with your family dwell with your wife
[1:13:45] we're gonna go into this on Sunday but
[1:13:47] so he's all these people are here I kind
[1:13:52] of went from a church now I'm down down
[1:13:53] to the family but all these people are
[1:13:56] here churches are like this they're
[1:13:58] around the place people are you know
[1:14:01] Paul speaks about don't and in the book
[1:14:05] of Hebrews do not lead a root of
[1:14:06] goodness come in and overthrow you and
[1:14:09] you can and you see especially ministers
[1:14:13] and cuz we're all human but things and
[1:14:16] even not even mrs. but but but later you
[1:14:19] like things can happen bad things can
[1:14:22] happen and it can enter and it can begin
[1:14:24] to grow as a root of bitterness you know
[1:14:27] in the person and they begin to look
[1:14:30] through that above anything else and
[1:14:32] they begin to minister through that or
[1:14:35] they begin to live through that and
[1:14:36] treat their family something can happen
[1:14:39] from not even from their family but it
[1:14:41] can influence them in a bad way and then
[1:14:44] and then through that they can actually
[1:14:46] try and live for their family but
[1:14:49] they're being affected by the sort of
[1:14:50] burdens and unfortunately you can see
[1:14:53] that as well and we're all not immune
[1:14:55] from it you know brother Brown preaching
[1:14:58] standing in the gap he says I lost my
[1:15:01] love for the people because they are
[1:15:04] turning down turning down the Lord and
[1:15:08] so he's being pushed too soon because of
[1:15:11] because of the rejection that he had to
[1:15:12] he had to suffer that rejection because
[1:15:15] there's a scripture saying behold I
[1:15:16] stand the door and knock
[1:15:18] and if any man opens the door I'll come
[1:15:20] and sup with him and he with me now he
[1:15:22] had to actually live out that scripture
[1:15:24] that was Christ being rejected we know
[1:15:26] from the church world but he had to he
[1:15:28] had to experience because he says I
[1:15:30] moved I moved down here to Tucson I've
[1:15:32] been here three years not one Church has
[1:15:34] invited me and he begins you know it
[1:15:37] comes down the end of his ministry says
[1:15:38] you know the full gospel businessman
[1:15:40] there's really only open door I have
[1:15:42] left and he's there on the outside
[1:15:45] trying to get in just like Christ is
[1:15:48] trying to get into the church but they
[1:15:50] kicked him out and but but it made him
[1:15:54] lose his love for the people and if that
[1:15:57] happened you say and here's a man here's
[1:16:00] a man who's been redeemed he's come to
[1:16:03] us adoption he's an adopted son but yet
[1:16:08] he loses his love for the people because
[1:16:10] of what has happened so none of us means
[1:16:14] I mean you think the prophet who that
[1:16:17] who the sword of the word came into his
[1:16:19] hand go back to Jeffersonville the seven
[1:16:22] seals going to be made known hallelujah
[1:16:25] here it was here he had the dispensation
[1:16:27] of the gospel for the same time amen
[1:16:30] incredible ministry he says but I lost
[1:16:33] my love for the people I have to get it
[1:16:35] back and he was being to make plans in
[1:16:38] his mind I'm gonna go live up northern
[1:16:39] British Columbia I'll be a trapper I'll
[1:16:41] be a hunter like a boys wanted to be
[1:16:42] it's because he lost his love for the
[1:16:44] people and we have to be careful friends
[1:16:48] this can happen to us to take a hit
[1:16:52] happened to him it happened to us
[1:16:54] because Elijah was a man of like
[1:16:56] passions Amen so we have to be careful
[1:17:00] of these things to not affect us now why
[1:17:06] did you say all this because it's all
[1:17:09] here
[1:17:10] go read that go read the epistles we
[1:17:13] Paul speaks about you know how the
[1:17:16] Galatian the condition error' in this
[1:17:17] way you understand where you see
[1:17:18] different movements and different things
[1:17:20] going on among the believers you say
[1:17:23] well why they like this why is this
[1:17:24] happening why are people fighting used
[1:17:27] to be more in the past
[1:17:28] I like this ministry I don't like this
[1:17:30] ministry you don't see
[1:17:32] you know we could go back into the Old
[1:17:33] Testament where maybe there's a maybe
[1:17:36] assuming in the bottle spring your
[1:17:37] brother brother Herman saying but
[1:17:41] brother branham he identified himself he
[1:17:42] says the first sermon I preached this is
[1:17:44] history repeating himself he says the
[1:17:46] first sermon I preached when I before I
[1:17:48] left the tabernacle was David and
[1:17:50] Goliath he says the great giant
[1:17:52] intellectual giant out there saying the
[1:17:54] days of miracles have passed
[1:17:55] I'm gonna go take the slingshot of faith
[1:17:57] I'm gonna go defeat that giant and he
[1:17:59] went out and killed the Giant and then
[1:18:01] he but then he begin to be a you know he
[1:18:04] was on the run in the church world amen
[1:18:07] he was he was kicked out members Christ
[1:18:09] that was on the run he said oh speaking
[1:18:11] of the rejected King and he was actually
[1:18:13] identifying in Scripture this is where
[1:18:15] you are as a people right and then now
[1:18:19] Saul but then what happens is now we are
[1:18:21] living at a time where where it used to
[1:18:24] be the anointing on the church was the
[1:18:26] man age anointing and the Pentecostal
[1:18:28] move was the end of the man age in
[1:18:30] programs is when the Eagle begins to fly
[1:18:32] me when the fourth seal yet when the
[1:18:34] seals open the fourth seal opens the
[1:18:36] Eagle begins to fly and we're now ready
[1:18:39] girl anointing he says the anointing is
[1:18:41] overlap like church age is Overland
[1:18:43] right and then so David's anointed king
[1:18:46] but the effect of Saul these former age
[1:18:49] there was man that there was man's
[1:18:51] wisdom how would you have a king well
[1:18:53] he'd be taller than everyone else he was
[1:18:55] big and strong you'd look like a king
[1:18:56] Saul was man's choice God where David
[1:19:00] was God's choice and then now there was
[1:19:02] a fight between two ages now Saul's Saul
[1:19:05] was they'll both anointed by the Prophet
[1:19:08] right this is a movement now I'm sorry
[1:19:10] I'm to try probably I can inch too much
[1:19:12] but go read 1st and 2nd Samuel go read
[1:19:16] from the prophet Samuel to Solomon
[1:19:18] building the temple and there was like a
[1:19:20] millennium their program says it was a
[1:19:22] millennium for Israel the first part of
[1:19:24] his reign you've gone to that span we're
[1:19:26] living in that span as well go read the
[1:19:30] Bible it's not just stories or you know
[1:19:34] it's more than that because if you can
[1:19:36] see this is where the this is where the
[1:19:38] believers were this is what they faced
[1:19:40] this is how they overcame you say now I
[1:19:42] can see this is where I was this is
[1:19:45] where I'm going
[1:19:46] and this is how I overcome a meant and
[1:19:49] then you see you see Saul dies in battle
[1:19:52] you know David's coming into power but
[1:19:55] now the house of Saul and the house of
[1:19:57] David of fighting this civil war and so
[1:20:00] there's fights there's been church wars
[1:20:02] within the message now of the seals the
[1:20:05] clothes the seals are open and there's
[1:20:07] been bitter fighting and there's been
[1:20:10] people it doesn't matter what side you
[1:20:12] know these people being like Joab the
[1:20:14] wars ended he says I'm going to get
[1:20:16] revenge on that brother calls him out of
[1:20:19] the City of Refuge kills him kills what
[1:20:22] Abner he was in a City of Refuge he was
[1:20:27] when assault generals he killed Joe Ed's
[1:20:29] brother so well how do you kill people
[1:20:32] today murder them booted their influence
[1:20:35] that that is murder
[1:20:37] that's like drag is going out and
[1:20:39] stabbing them with a sword and this yo
[1:20:42] but you see so the house of Saul goes
[1:20:45] down that a man agent 19 as God I'm
[1:20:48] going off the scene the Eagle anointing
[1:20:50] come forth again we we have what they
[1:20:52] had that's why we had Sunday Sunday was
[1:20:55] glorious but it shouldn't be a surprise
[1:20:57] to us we should expect him to move like
[1:20:59] that amen that's what they had a
[1:21:01] Pentecost that he's still the same today
[1:21:03] but God doesn't take away he adds how
[1:21:06] lujah he just adds to and so now the
[1:21:09] house of Saul I mean the house of David
[1:21:12] comes into power then the tribes gather
[1:21:14] say let's make David King over all of us
[1:21:17] lujah then that now brings forth Solomon
[1:21:20] and Solomon brings forth a millennium
[1:21:24] amen go read your Bible well the band
[1:21:28] said this is a new book this is a new
[1:21:30] book and so you need to go read go go
[1:21:35] read those places read from Samuel to
[1:21:40] Solomon and read from John the Baptist
[1:21:43] to the end of the New Testament he said
[1:21:46] that's a lot of reading that you'll find
[1:21:48] you see menace
[1:21:49] you know you see mission work that's
[1:21:52] happened around the world as it normally
[1:21:54] happened song gets a burden we heard
[1:21:56] about it up far north all these
[1:21:57] different ministries were there where
[1:22:00] boon for this cancer we had a burden for
[1:22:01] our people and God just open a door
[1:22:03] people go to another country to go to
[1:22:05] another place that meets a certain
[1:22:07] someone like Lydia the seller of purple
[1:22:09] there on the riverbank you know that be
[1:22:11] called a certain place have a burden God
[1:22:13] opens the door
[1:22:14] people are burst into the kingdom
[1:22:16] churches are established there may be a
[1:22:18] call go over here do this come here do
[1:22:20] this separating to meet Paul and
[1:22:22] Barnabas for the work Alleluia and
[1:22:24] history has repeated itself I mean we
[1:22:28] have some musicians to come but history
[1:22:33] it's all repeated itself but now we've
[1:22:39] come to a time where I trust we are none
[1:22:45] of the bad of those churches in the New
[1:22:49] Testament we're all of the good and
[1:22:51] we've come to our Ephesians as brother M
[1:22:53] system I believe its paradox that we
[1:22:55] come to another Ephesians but we're not
[1:22:58] going to roulette amen and relax and go
[1:23:00] down we'll get a piece of the mark of
[1:23:02] the high calling because we're anointed
[1:23:04] to do it
