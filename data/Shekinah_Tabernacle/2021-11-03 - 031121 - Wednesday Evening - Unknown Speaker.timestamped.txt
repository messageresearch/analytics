[13:55] um
[13:56] okay maybe just before we we sing our
[13:58] next
[13:59] song children i was thinking of you um a
[14:02] little testimony just of that song um
[14:05] i don't know this is probably in 1997 i
[14:07] think that this came out
[14:09] a chap called red matt redmond i think
[14:12] and
[14:14] even though i had a little bit of the
[14:16] lord at that point in my life i was
[14:18] trying to serve him as much as i could
[14:20] and i had this little um
[14:23] what they call service here for christ
[14:24] and at this point of my life i was in
[14:26] the outreach team and we went to
[14:29] amsterdam and holland to to reach out
[14:31] and one of the things that we did was
[14:34] right at the end of the of the red light
[14:36] district or the dangerous district we
[14:38] had a little um cafe um when i say we we
[14:42] we just joined
[14:44] y wam at the point
[14:45] and um
[14:47] there was a lot of bums coming in a lot
[14:48] of people off the street and privatized
[14:50] and people that probably couldn't make
[14:52] it in the first world country couldn't
[14:54] get a job or something like that a lot
[14:56] of refugees and the one thing that they
[14:58] said was there was a double story
[15:00] building and at the top is the is the
[15:02] cafe and at the bottom there's a little
[15:04] basin
[15:06] uh a basement sorry um
[15:08] where
[15:09] we would play all these songs we had a
[15:11] little just a handful of cds back then
[15:14] yes it was cds so we had this whole and
[15:17] on repeat
[15:18] so the the one one commandment the one
[15:23] rule that we had to follow for everyone
[15:24] that's at the top of the cafe
[15:26] serving the people playing chess with
[15:28] him giving them a little bread or
[15:29] something to drink you never talk the
[15:32] gospel you never see say anything about
[15:35] the word anything about the bible you
[15:37] are there
[15:39] you are the bible
[15:41] and that never got real actually up
[15:43] until very recently that this is this is
[15:46] the bible so we had to sit there and we
[15:48] had to we we had we were happy but we we
[15:51] were fed we were you know we we
[15:54] if i can put it that we didn't need
[15:56] faith in that particular instance um
[15:58] because we weren't um
[16:00] in the situation they were so we had to
[16:02] play chess we had to give them a little
[16:04] peanut butter sandwich and make them
[16:06] little tea uh but never spoke the word
[16:09] and at the bottom of all this where all
[16:11] this commotion is going on and and chit
[16:14] chat there was one team so we we rosted
[16:17] our teams so the one team would just be
[16:19] in worship we've just been praying and
[16:22] we had this continuously praying uh
[16:24] playing in the background while we were
[16:26] praying and sort of interceding for that
[16:28] little moment that we had a glimpse it's
[16:30] five seconds you know
[16:32] that you could maybe share if they
[16:33] opened up if they opened up and we left
[16:36] there you wouldn't you would never know
[16:38] we would never know you know one day

[32:59] amen it's great to have christiana here
[33:01] welcome god bless you thank you amen
[33:03] does you feel at home
[33:05] and uh sister louise is here too god
[33:06] bless you
[33:08] amen praise the lord
[33:10] um
[33:11] amen so let's just turn let's read the
[33:13] scripture so we're here as our every
[33:15] month we listen to a portion of a of a
[33:17] message by brother branham and uh we're
[33:19] here on the seventh seal
[33:21] so we're just going to read uh
[33:22] revelations eight and one
[33:26] and um and then we're going to
[33:29] or maybe yeah
[33:31] we'll just read this and then you can
[33:33] um have your seat so
[33:35] this this seal is a uh it's actually the
[33:38] coming of the lord
[33:40] and um but anyway we just read this one
[33:42] verse revelations 8 and 1 it says and
[33:44] when he had opened the seventh seal is
[33:46] the lamb that opens the seals
[33:48] there was silence in heaven about the
[33:50] space of half an hour
[33:53] and this portion is quite hard as i said
[33:55] the later messages to get a kind of a
[33:57] condensed part because you've got to
[33:59] re-listen to the whole thing but you'll
[34:01] see in this brother brown says it's
[34:02] revealed in a three-fold way
[34:04] and he says i'm going to reveal the
[34:06] first fold of it
[34:07] but he doesn't he doesn't preach the
[34:09] next part of that until he preaches
[34:11] christ as the mystery of god revealed
[34:13] so on this one he says
[34:15] it wasn't interpreted to me because the
[34:16] devil could do great damage if he knew
[34:18] what it was but then a few months later
[34:20] he preaches christ's mystery god
[34:21] revealed so if you want to know what the
[34:22] seventh seal is listen to christ it's
[34:24] the mystery of god revealed
[34:26] right and then now notice when you're
[34:28] listening he mentions this silence in
[34:30] heaven is when the lamb takes the book
[34:32] so all the angels stop everything stops
[34:34] because such a great act is taking place
[34:36] where the lamb steps forth he's been
[34:38] intermediating
[34:40] our intermediary for 2000 years has
[34:42] finally come to step forth to claim that
[34:44] which he purchased that down calvary so
[34:46] just an incredible hour that we live in
[34:48] where the lord is is
[34:50] is purchasing and that's what is
[34:51] happening and trust in your life if
[34:53] there's a pull in your life towards god
[34:55] irrespective of what's going on in the
[34:57] devil's pools whatever but if there's a
[34:59] pull there's a hunger that's the lord
[35:01] putting it in you because he says you
[35:02] are mine and i'll make claim on you the
[35:05] devil can fight all he wants but he's he
[35:07] he has to let go
[35:08] hallelujah so
[35:10] you know and then um
[35:12] yeah so he says so it's revealed in a
[35:14] three-fold way but he only says he and
[35:16] he just makes the comment i'm just going
[35:17] to reveal uh the first part of it but in
[35:20] the message chris and mr god reveal
[35:21] which we'll we'll start listening to
[35:23] next month he goes into what the seventh
[35:25] year is the coming of the lord okay
[35:27] um and then if we just as you're
[35:31] getting that going um if we turn to
[35:34] matthew chapter 24
[35:36] um we have the seven seals jesus because
[35:39] we know what jesus preached in the
[35:40] gospels was all in seed form
[35:43] uh you know condensed form then the
[35:44] apostle paul different ones they they
[35:46] opened it up
[35:47] um so
[35:49] what john was seeing in the seventh
[35:51] seals is jesus was was referring to in
[35:54] matthew 24 we know in matthew 24 jesus
[35:57] has been shown the temple and everything
[35:59] and
[36:00] um and the disciples say to him you know
[36:02] what great you know goodly stones are
[36:04] here and he says you know don't you know
[36:05] that there'll come a time where not one
[36:07] of these stones be left upon another
[36:09] and then they ask him three questions
[36:11] when will these things be the
[36:12] destruction of the temple you know and
[36:14] the sign of thy coming in the end of the
[36:15] world and he answers those three
[36:17] questions in matthew 24 and 25. now if i
[36:20] just have it here i trust i can
[36:23] find it i'm in 25's go back one more
[36:30] now he goes down
[36:32] and and i won't break it down now but
[36:34] you can read
[36:36] you can read matthew
[36:37] 24 and he begins to reveal what the
[36:41] first six seals are
[36:43] but then when it comes down to the
[36:44] seventh seal
[36:46] he says he says but of the day and the
[36:48] hour knoweth no man this is verse 36 no
[36:52] not the angels of heaven but my father
[36:54] only speaking of his coming
[36:57] so it's a
[36:58] mystery only with god
[37:00] but then it's been revealed in this end
[37:02] time and brother brahm says in the
[37:03] message christ's mystery god revealed
[37:04] it's been revealed in every type and
[37:06] shadow of the believers is revealed down
[37:08] today
[37:10] the coming of the lord
[37:11] because all the acts of the believers is
[37:14] pointing to that great event that's
[37:16] right what joseph did what ruth did what
[37:18] moses did what elijah did all the
[37:20] believers down through the ages were
[37:21] revealing that one great event
[37:24] i mean so
[37:25] so it may seem like um
[37:27] you know when i first became a believer
[37:29] and i got this seals book i thought i'm
[37:31] going to read the seventh seal because i
[37:33] always read the last chapter of a book
[37:34] first
[37:35] and then i was like there's no real
[37:37] answer in this what does this mean i
[37:38] went back to the beginning then as i was
[37:40] going along you know rick christ and mr
[37:42] god revealed that
[37:43] the prophet said this is what the
[37:44] seventh seal is
[37:46] so it's open
[37:48] it's all open yeah amen so
[37:51] and then you'll notice at the end of
[37:52] this message uh he says that uh of this
[37:54] portion that we listen to he says i may
[37:56] be laying a platform for a great one to
[37:58] come
[37:59] now some people have taken that saying
[38:01] it's my ministry but no the great
[38:04] platform we laid for the great one to
[38:05] come was the lord jesus christ himself
[38:07] to have a personal relationship with you
[38:08] and i
[38:09] i mean as john the baptist for on the
[38:11] first coming of christ so the message of
[38:12] william brown was for on the second
[38:13] coming john introduced the messiah to
[38:16] the people
[38:17] right and so the message of brother
[38:18] barum is using the messiah the word
[38:20] jesus christ to the people so it's us
[38:22] and god walking together becoming one
[38:25] i mean so um i trust this is a blessing
[38:29] in some form so
[38:31] without further ado
[38:33] uh technical difficulties here that some
[38:36] praise a lot for the tech team but who's
[38:38] happy to be a christian
[38:40] you know many things are going on in the
[38:41] world but god's in control
[38:43] not one speak of it's out of you know
[38:45] outside his control he knows what he's
[38:47] doing
[38:48] he has confidence in his salvation
[38:51] amen so you know it doesn't matter what
[38:52] the devil tries to do the lord has
[38:54] confidence in his salvation you know you
[38:56] know job was counted he he was
[38:59] considered a perfect man the lord's
[39:00] testimony of job was that he's a perfect
[39:03] man he testifies to the devil he's a
[39:04] perfect man there's no one else like him
[39:06] in the world do you know what made him
[39:07] that perfect man
[39:09] is because he had perfect faith and
[39:11] confidence in the shed blood of the lamb
[39:13] that's what made him that kind of a man
[39:15] i mean so if you and i yeah because
[39:17] that's what made job righteous it wasn't
[39:19] his own acts that were made and
[39:20] righteous as it was faith in the shed
[39:22] blood of that lamb
[39:24] hallelujah and if that is a man under
[39:26] the blood of bulls and goats how much
[39:27] more people
[39:28] under the blood of the son of god amen
[39:30] jesus christ himself
[39:32] hallelujah so
[39:34] his salvation works it's been proved
[39:36] down through the ages
[39:38] amen people went into i'm just waiting
[39:40] for this to start going but you know
[39:41] people walked into fire they walked into
[39:43] torture they walked into lions dens they
[39:45] walked into arenas they they walked into
[39:47] all kinds of trouble but they knew the
[39:49] lord amen would see them through that
[39:51] they would even if they had to give
[39:52] their bodies to be burned or whatever
[39:54] they would die in faith and you think
[39:56] how incredible would it be
[39:58] you're waiting to go until going into
[40:00] the arena remember the anointing was
[40:01] with them they are anointed with that
[40:03] anointing of sacrifice imagine that you
[40:05] know you can hear the lions out there
[40:07] all the gladiators and stuff and and you
[40:09] know would be gathered around you'd say
[40:10] children
[40:12] it won't be much longer and the one
[40:14] we've loved
[40:15] we're going to see him
[40:17] hallelujah it may be the way that by the
[40:19] way this line but we're going to see him
[40:21] holly we're going to go into his
[40:22] presence i mean very soon that they
[40:24] won't be done and we'll be in his
[40:25] presence
[40:26] what a kind of excitement could be in
[40:27] your heart burning amen hallelujah walk
[40:30] into that kind of you think that's a
[40:31] horrible way to die and all those things
[40:33] no
[40:33] i believe is to die in faith
[40:35] it doesn't matter what happens to make
[40:37] us go from this world to the next i mean
[40:39] god has orchestrated it and god has
[40:41] given us overcoming power i mean to
[40:43] overcome every spirit of the devil and
[40:45] brother brahm says the same faith the
[40:47] same faith that the martyrs had to
[40:50] overcome whatever obstacle came against
[40:52] them is the same faith we daily live by
[40:54] that overcome satan's eden
[40:57] hallelujah

[43:51] of the or the first verse i mean of the
[43:53] 8th chapter
[43:54] revelation
[43:56] 8 1
[43:58] i know your time
[44:00] and i just try to listen just for a few
[44:02] minutes now
[44:04] the god of heaven
[44:06] helps
[44:10] we must remember
[44:12] that this seventh seal
[44:14] is the end of time of all things
[44:19] fine
[44:21] the things written
[44:22] in the seventh seal book
[44:25] sealed up of the plan of redemption from
[44:29] before the foundational world and every
[44:31] bit ends
[44:33] it is the end it is the end of the
[44:37] struggling world is end of struggling
[44:39] nature it's the end of everything in
[44:42] there it's the end of the trumpets it's
[44:43] the end of the vials it's the end of the
[44:46] earth it's a it's even the end of time
[44:50] time runs out
[44:52] the bible said so
[44:54] matthew the seventh chapter i mean uh
[44:57] revelations the seventh chapter and one
[45:00] the seven first
[45:01] time runs out angel said time will be no
[45:04] more
[45:05] well in the days of this great thing to
[45:08] happen everything runs out in this time
[45:11] the end of the
[45:13] at the end of this seventh seal lord
[45:16] it's the end of the church age
[45:18] it's the the end of the seventh seal
[45:21] it's the end of the trumpets it's the
[45:23] end of the vials
[45:25] and even in the ushering in of the
[45:28] millennium
[45:31] that's on the seventh seal
[45:33] it's just like firing a rocket into the
[45:35] air all right and that rocket explodes
[45:37] here and it goes up then it explodes
[45:39] again it puts out five stars
[45:43] one of those stars exploding blows out
[45:45] five stars from it
[45:47] and then one of them starts explodes
[45:49] goes out five stars submit see it fades
[45:51] on out that's what the seventh seal
[45:53] right and this ends the time for the
[45:55] world it is the time for this it needs a
[45:57] time for that and then it's a time for
[45:59] this and then it's the time everything
[46:01] just ended up on that seventh seal
[46:04] now how is he going to do it that's what
[46:06] we don't know isn't it
[46:09] we don't know
[46:10] it's even
[46:11] time for all these things and the
[46:13] ushering in other millennium notice
[46:16] the breaking of this seal was so great
[46:20] that heaven
[46:22] was hush-fired in silence for the space
[46:25] of a half-hour
[46:29] is it great
[46:31] what is it
[46:33] it was hushed
[46:35] heavens there was a thing moved
[46:38] for a half hour
[46:39] now half hour might not be long if
[46:41] you're having a good time
[46:43] but in the suspense
[46:45] between death and life it seemed like a
[46:48] millennium
[46:50] it was so great
[46:52] jesus never mentioned it not arrested
[46:54] john couldn't even ride of it
[46:56] no
[46:58] he was forbidden right here see there's
[46:59] just a just
[47:01] he didn't wrap it at this his silence
[47:03] and the four and 20 elders that stood
[47:07] before god they're harping with their
[47:09] harps they quit playing their harps
[47:13] the angels hurst their singing
[47:16] in heaven
[47:19] thank the holy cherubins and seraphims
[47:22] that isaiah saw it in the temple with
[47:24] six
[47:25] sets or three sets of wings
[47:27] three or two over his face and two over
[47:29] his feet and flying and he's day and
[47:31] night there before god saying holy holy
[47:34] holy is the lord god almighty and even
[47:37] when they walked there come into the
[47:38] temple the post of the temple move with
[47:40] their their presence
[47:42] and these holy seraphians hushed up
[47:49] angels quit singing
[47:55] flying in the presence of god saying
[47:57] holy holy holy they shut up
[48:01] no angel saying
[48:03] no praises no no altar service no
[48:06] nothing
[48:07] there was silence
[48:09] hush deadly silence in heaven for a half
[48:11] hour
[48:12] all the host of heaven was silent for
[48:15] this half hour when the seventh sealed
[48:17] mystery in the book of redemption was
[48:20] broke open
[48:24] think of it but it's broke amen
[48:28] the lamb breaks it
[48:31] you know what they were by it i mean
[48:35] they didn't know
[48:36] that it was it just stopped
[48:38] why
[48:39] what is it
[48:41] now
[48:44] none of us know
[48:46] but i'm
[48:50] i'm going to tell you my
[48:53] my revelation of it
[48:57] and uh
[48:59] i am not prone to be a fanatic if i am
[49:02] i'm ignorant of it
[49:05] i am i'm not giving away to
[49:08] uh such as
[49:10] uh
[49:11] lyrius uh
[49:13] carry ons and imaginary things
[49:16] i said some things might have been kind
[49:18] of strange to some people but when god
[49:20] comes around behind it and then the case
[49:22] and says it's the truth then that's
[49:24] god's word
[49:25] may seem strange that way
[49:29] and now
[49:31] uh certain
[49:33] as i stand in the platform
[49:36] tonight
[49:39] i
[49:40] had the revelation that revealed it's in
[49:43] a threefold manner
[49:46] that i will speak to you by god's help
[49:49] of a fool of it
[49:51] and then you let's go to that first
[49:54] here's the revelation
[49:56] to begin what i want to tell you what it
[49:59] is
[50:00] what happens
[50:01] is that
[50:02] those seven thunders
[50:05] that he heard thunder
[50:07] and was forbidden to write
[50:10] that's what the mystery is laying behind
[50:12] those seven consecutive thunders rolling
[50:15] out
[50:18] now why let us prove it why
[50:21] it is the secret that no one knows about
[50:25] john was forbidding to write about it
[50:28] even even write a symbol about it why
[50:31] this is why
[50:33] there was no active in head activity in
[50:36] heaven
[50:37] it might give away the secret
[50:40] do you see it now amen
[50:43] if it's so great it must be included
[50:46] because it's got to happen
[50:48] but when the seven thunders i noticed
[50:50] when the seven angels come forth to
[50:52] sound their trumpets there was one
[50:54] thunder
[50:56] when israel was gathered there was a
[50:57] trumpet
[50:59] when times shall be no more the last
[51:01] trumpet
[51:04] one thunder
[51:06] but here is seven straight thunders
[51:09] right in a row one two three four five
[51:11] six seven
[51:14] that perfect number
[51:16] seven thunders
[51:18] in a row
[51:19] uttered not nick is it's one two three
[51:22] four five six seven straight
[51:25] then
[51:27] heavens couldn't write that
[51:29] heavens can't know about it nothing else
[51:32] because there's nothing to go wrong
[51:34] it's relaxing time it was so great till
[51:36] it's kept secret from the angels
[51:40] now
[51:41] why
[51:42] if satan should get a hold of it
[51:46] you might do great damage yeah that's
[51:48] one thing he don't know
[51:52] he can interpret anything he wants to
[51:54] and impersonate any kind of a gift
[51:59] amen
[52:00] i hope you're learning
[52:02] [Music]
[52:03] he can't know this it's not even written
[52:06] in the word
[52:09] it's a total secret the angels
[52:11] everything shut up
[52:13] amen
[52:14] if they made one move if i give
[52:15] something away so they just shut up quit
[52:18] harping
[52:20] everything stopped
[52:22] uh seven god's perfect number
[52:25] seven
[52:27] just right down the road
[52:29] seven
[52:30] thunders utter straight together
[52:34] mike is spelling out something
[52:36] notice at that time
[52:39] john's started writing he said don't
[52:41] write it
[52:44] jesus
[52:45] never spoke of it
[52:48] john couldn't write it
[52:50] angels know nothing about it
[52:52] amen what is it
[52:54] it's the thing that jesus said even the
[52:58] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[53:00] about it see
[53:03] he didn't know it himself amen he said
[53:06] only god would know it amen
[53:08] but he told us when we began to see
[53:10] these signs coming up
[53:13] how are you getting somewhere
[53:15] all right
[53:16] notice
[53:16] we can see these signs coming up me
[53:21] if satan can get a hold of it if you
[53:23] want something to happen
[53:25] uh you'll have to take my word for this
[53:27] if i'm planning on doing something i
[53:30] know better than to tell anybody about
[53:32] it
[53:33] not that person tell it but satan here
[53:36] see he can't get in my heart there as
[53:39] long as god's got it closed up with the
[53:40] holy spirit so that's between me and god
[53:46] he don't know nothing about it until you
[53:48] speak it then he hears it yes and i'll
[53:50] try i tell people i'll do a certain
[53:51] certain thing and watch the devil cut
[53:53] off every wheel he can to get in there
[53:55] see to beat me to it but if i get the
[53:57] revelation from god this don't say
[53:59] nothing about it
[54:01] then it's different
[54:04] remember
[54:07] satan will try to impersonate
[54:11] he'll try to impersonate everything that
[54:14] the church will do he's trying to do it
[54:16] we notice it through the antichrist but
[54:18] this is one thing he cannot impersonate
[54:21] amen
[54:22] there'll be no mimics to this
[54:27] because he don't know it
[54:30] no way fine to know it
[54:32] it's the third pull he just knows
[54:34] nothing about it
[54:51] i can never think the same the rest of
[54:52] my life
[54:55] when i seen now i don't know what
[54:58] i know the next step there but i don't
[55:01] know what how to interpret that
[55:04] it won't be long
[55:07] i've got row down here when it happened
[55:10] if you can see here
[55:11] stop
[55:13] go no further
[55:16] than this right here i'm not prone to be
[55:18] a fanatic just telling the truth but you
[55:21] remember
[55:23] the little shoe that i always tried to
[55:26] explain how that the soul laid next to
[55:28] so and so on the inner conscience and
[55:30] all that kind of stuff which it only
[55:32] made a big bunch of impersonations start
[55:34] after
[55:35] how did that take up the hand and hold
[55:37] the people had vibration everybody had a

[1:04:57] exactly what happened something hit and
[1:04:59] said don't fear this is that third pull
[1:05:05] third pull you remember
[1:05:08] he said you've had so many impersonators
[1:05:10] on this what you tried to explain
[1:05:13] i said don't even try this
[1:05:15] remember how many remembers that vision
[1:05:17] why it's all
[1:05:18] taken everywhere that's been about six
[1:05:20] years ago
[1:05:21] seven years ago and seven years ago said
[1:05:24] don't try to explain that
[1:05:27] said this is the third poll but i'll
[1:05:29] meet you in there
[1:05:31] that right
[1:05:33] he said don't i was standing with a a
[1:05:36] little baby shoe when he told me
[1:05:38] something make your first pull and when
[1:05:39] you do the fish will run after the lure
[1:05:42] so then watch your second pull said
[1:05:44] because it'll only be small fish
[1:05:46] he said then the third pawn will get it
[1:05:48] and all that ministers got around he
[1:05:50] said brother brahm we know you can do it
[1:05:51] hallelujah brother brown that's where i
[1:05:53] always get tied up with a bunch of
[1:05:54] preachers
[1:05:55] i love people they want you to explain
[1:05:57] everything just that and i said well uh
[1:06:00] uh uh oh i said i i don't know i said
[1:06:02] i'd understand fishing now i said now
[1:06:04] first thing you do here's what's done
[1:06:06] you see all the fish around you got the
[1:06:08] jerk the lure well that's exactly the
[1:06:10] tactic sufficient so i said jerk the
[1:06:12] lure nice see when i tricked the lure
[1:06:13] the first time now the fish takes out
[1:06:15] hatred but there were little ones that's
[1:06:18] just like they were catching so then i i
[1:06:20] said dandy you're set
[1:06:22] and i jerked it out on the bank i had a
[1:06:24] fish but it looked like a skin over the
[1:06:25] lure it's just it was so little
[1:06:28] and then i stand there and something
[1:06:29] said i told you not to do that
[1:06:34] i started crying all the line was
[1:06:37] tangled around me like this my head was
[1:06:39] standing there crying with my head down
[1:06:41] like that i said god
[1:06:42] oh i forgive me i
[1:06:45] i'm a stupid person lord don't forgive
[1:06:48] me and i i had this line and that what i
[1:06:51] had in my hand was a little baby shoe
[1:06:53] about that long
[1:06:55] and i had that string was about as big
[1:06:57] around as my finger about a half inch
[1:06:58] line and the eyelet in this shoe was
[1:07:02] just about the size of a uh littler than
[1:07:05] uh
[1:07:06] uh 1 16 probably of an inch in the
[1:07:09] eyelet and i was trying to lace this
[1:07:11] little shoe up with this great big inch
[1:07:13] card
[1:07:16] a voice comes said you can't teach
[1:07:18] pentecostal babies supernatural things
[1:07:23] he said now let him alone
[1:07:26] and just saying he picked me up he took
[1:07:28] me up and set me way up high the world
[1:07:29] meeting was gonna look like a tent or a
[1:07:31] cathedral of some sort now look there's
[1:07:34] a little box like little place over in
[1:07:36] the sign
[1:07:36] and i seen that light
[1:07:38] was talking to somebody about me that
[1:07:40] light that you see there on the picture
[1:07:42] it whirled away from me like that and
[1:07:44] went over that tent and said i'll meet
[1:07:46] you there
[1:07:47] and said this will be the third pool and
[1:07:50] you won't tell it to nobody
[1:07:54] and in sabinia cannon he said this is
[1:07:57] the third pool
[1:07:58] and there's three great things that goes
[1:08:00] with it
[1:08:02] and one unfolded
[1:08:04] today or yesterday the other one
[1:08:07] unfolded today and there's one thing
[1:08:10] that i cannot interpret because it's in
[1:08:12] an unknown language
[1:08:14] but stand right there and look right
[1:08:17] straight at it
[1:08:18] and this is the third poll coming up
[1:08:21] amen and the holy spirit of god
[1:08:25] oh my
[1:08:26] that's the reason all heaven messiah
[1:08:30] man
[1:08:31] now
[1:08:32] i better stop right here see
[1:08:34] i just i just feel checked not to say no
[1:08:36] more about see so just remember
[1:08:40] the seventh seal the reason it was not
[1:08:43] open
[1:08:45] the reason it did not reveal it
[1:08:48] no one should know about it and i want
[1:08:51] you to know before i even note any word
[1:08:53] about that that vision come years ago do
[1:08:56] you remember that
[1:08:57] and here it is just as this other house
[1:08:59] slides right straight into the word
[1:09:02] exactly where it was and god knows my
[1:09:04] heart i remember one time thought of
[1:09:06] such a thing as that amen and here it
[1:09:08] was
[1:09:09] it's later than we think amen
[1:09:17] this shows us from god amen for see
[1:09:20] it fits exactly in the promises of god
[1:09:24] from the
[1:09:25] end of the the message
[1:09:28] you notice
[1:09:29] notice now
[1:09:30] for the end of time message
[1:09:34] this seal after all
[1:09:37] he's revealed all the six seals but
[1:09:39] don't say anything about the seven
[1:09:42] and the end time seal when it starts
[1:09:44] will be absolutely a total secret
[1:09:48] according to the bible
[1:09:51] before knowing that and remember
[1:09:54] revelations 10 1 7
[1:09:58] 1-7
[1:10:00] chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh
[1:10:04] angel's message
[1:10:06] all
[1:10:09] the mysteries of god
[1:10:11] will be known
[1:10:13] we're at the end time the opening of the
[1:10:17] seventh seal
[1:10:19] now
[1:10:20] how did i know the other day like sunday
[1:10:23] a week ago today i was preaching on be
[1:10:26] humble be humble remember god veils
[1:10:29] little things i didn't realize what it
[1:10:31] really was talking about and now i see
[1:10:33] it
[1:10:34] it is in such a humble way
[1:10:36] you're thinking something like that
[1:10:38] would be revealed to the vatican
[1:10:40] but it comes just like john the baptist
[1:10:42] amen it comes like the birth of our lord
[1:10:45] and the state of the lord glory to god
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:54] we're here
[1:10:56] oh my
[1:10:57] how do you see it the truth of god's
[1:11:00] vision the seven angel bringing me from
[1:11:03] the west they were coming from the west
[1:11:05] coming back east bringing here for this
[1:11:08] message tonight
[1:11:10] oh my
[1:11:12] now
[1:11:14] the voice of that great thunder and the
[1:11:17] mission that was brought here has been
[1:11:19] revealed
[1:11:20] that it and proven that it was of god
[1:11:24] the state now
[1:11:26] i knew not these seals
[1:11:30] and they've been revealed this week
[1:11:34] did anybody think of that
[1:11:36] are those seven angels
[1:11:39] being this being the message that is
[1:11:41] coming forth then angels bring me back
[1:11:42] here for that
[1:11:44] remember
[1:11:45] the seventh messenger was
[1:11:47] the seven messengers
[1:11:49] was
[1:11:51] the
[1:11:52] noted one to me the seventh angel it
[1:11:55] seemed more to me than anything i see
[1:11:57] they were standing like this
[1:12:01] all right we're just
[1:12:03] watching the north
[1:12:04] and i was standing here
[1:12:07] and i was watching those other see one
[1:12:10] first bunch of little birds feathers all
[1:12:12] beat down you remember them
[1:12:14] and they all flew eastward
[1:12:17] and the
[1:12:18] second bus were brighter
[1:12:21] bigger birds look like doves pointed
[1:12:23] wings
[1:12:25] they flew eastward first full
[1:12:27] second bull
[1:12:29] then the next was angels
[1:12:32] and it's standing right there and this
[1:12:35] explosion left and i was looking this
[1:12:37] way towards the west and they come and
[1:12:39] just pick me up in there and i went out
[1:12:41] of my knowing
[1:12:44] and the one of them coming was the one
[1:12:46] that looks strange to me was the one on
[1:12:50] my beat the left where i entered the
[1:12:52] constellation at but counting from the
[1:12:54] left to the right it would have been the
[1:12:56] seventh angel
[1:12:58] okay coming across now
[1:13:01] remember the seven messengers do you
[1:13:04] remember the pyramid of white rock
[1:13:08] of junior jackson's dream that i
[1:13:10] interpreted you
[1:13:15] notice
[1:13:17] the night that i left
[1:13:20] and i there were six dreams came
[1:13:23] and every one of them directly to the
[1:13:25] same thing
[1:13:26] then the vision started and sent me west
[1:13:30] junior he was watching well notice look
[1:13:34] how perfect
[1:13:37] i'm i'm hoping and trusting that you
[1:13:40] people realize that i'm trying to put
[1:13:42] this grace on jesus christ who is the
[1:13:46] author of all of it and the only reason
[1:13:49] you never heard me talk like this before
[1:13:50] in your life
[1:13:52] amen but this hour is approaching amen
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:59] [Applause]
[1:14:00] i have to make it sure to you
[1:14:03] so it can be driven down
[1:14:05] i'm fixing to leave you again
[1:14:07] i don't know where i go
[1:14:09] i must preach the gospel other places
[1:14:12] but now that you might say i've heard
[1:14:14] all that kind of fanaticism i don't know
[1:14:16] why i can't judge any other man i only
[1:14:18] have to answer to god for what i or for
[1:14:21] myself
[1:14:22] but has there ever been one time i ever
[1:14:25] told you anything in the name of the
[1:14:26] lord it wasn't right and all these years
[1:14:29] nobody else can say so because i always
[1:14:31] told it just the way he told him now let
[1:14:33] me just
[1:14:34] show you that this is exactly true and
[1:14:36] confirm it now remember if there be a
[1:14:38] spiritual our prophet
[1:14:40] the lord will speak to him in visions
[1:14:43] and
[1:14:44] make knowing about dreams interpreting
[1:14:46] dreams is that joseph he can interpret
[1:14:48] dreams and speaking and see visions is
[1:14:51] that true
[1:14:52] now notice this
[1:14:54] that now
[1:14:55] when this taken place
[1:14:57] junior was standing in a field that had
[1:14:59] a had a big pyramid to it like that and
[1:15:02] there was something right on the rocks
[1:15:04] and i was revealing that to the people
[1:15:06] is that right junior
[1:15:08] about a year before it happened
[1:15:10] and notice the next thing now i took
[1:15:12] some kind of a bar and cut it off and on
[1:15:14] the inside was white rock that had
[1:15:16] nothing wrote on it
[1:15:18] and at that time i started to the west
[1:15:21] and i told them all i said don't go out
[1:15:24] west stay here
[1:15:26] and look on this until i return
[1:15:30] went west for the blessed return back
[1:15:34] to the east
[1:15:36] with the holy spirit interpreting this
[1:15:40] unwritten word amen
[1:15:43] amen now if that isn't personally
[1:15:45] a god almighty and i want you to know
[1:15:47] what it is what am i trying to say this
[1:15:49] for friend is to show you we're at the
[1:15:51] end
[1:15:52] now if that others is perfectly on the
[1:15:55] dot with the word so is this perfectly
[1:15:58] on the dot with the word
[1:16:01] we are here
[1:16:04] we're at the end
[1:16:06] soon it shall be time run out
[1:16:10] millions will lose their lives
[1:16:13] millions will be
[1:16:15] now believe that they are saved
[1:16:18] will be counted fodder
[1:16:21] for the atomic age
[1:16:23] we are living at the last hour
[1:16:27] by the grace of almighty god
[1:16:30] by his help
[1:16:32] to his people that they might look
[1:16:34] forward to the soon appearing of christ
[1:16:37] how long brother branham maybe in 20
[1:16:39] years
[1:16:40] maybe in 50 years
[1:16:42] maybe 100 years i don't know
[1:16:45] and maybe in the morning
[1:16:46] maybe yet tonight
[1:16:48] i don't know
[1:16:49] and anybody says that you know they're
[1:16:51] wrong amen
[1:16:57] now
[1:16:58] notice
[1:16:59] so help me by god i tell the truth
[1:17:03] that these are
[1:17:05] spiritually discerned to me
[1:17:09] discerned by the holy spirit
[1:17:12] and
[1:17:14] by every one of them has identified its
[1:17:16] place in the bible
[1:17:20] now what this great secret is that lays
[1:17:23] beneath this seal
[1:17:24] i do not know
[1:17:26] i don't know it
[1:17:28] i couldn't make it out i couldn't tell
[1:17:31] it
[1:17:32] just what it was what it said
[1:17:34] but i know that it was in seven thunders
[1:17:38] other than themselves right close
[1:17:39] together just banging seven different
[1:17:41] times and it unfolded into something
[1:17:44] else that i see
[1:17:46] then when i've seen that i'll look for
[1:17:47] the interpretation it flew across there
[1:17:49] and i couldn't make it out
[1:17:51] that's exactly right
[1:17:53] the
[1:17:54] hour isn't quite yet far amen but it's
[1:17:57] moving into that cycle
[1:17:59] see it's coming up close
[1:18:02] so the thing for you to do is to
[1:18:04] remember that i speak to you in the name
[1:18:07] of the lord
[1:18:12] hallelujah be prepared or you don't know
[1:18:15] what time something can happen
[1:18:17] now when that gets on tape which it is
[1:18:20] that will probably send 10 000 of my
[1:18:23] friends away from me
[1:18:24] because we're going to say that brother
[1:18:26] brown's trying to put himself and make
[1:18:28] himself a a servant or a prophet or
[1:18:30] something before god let me tell you my
[1:18:33] brethren
[1:18:34] that is an era amen i'm only telling you
[1:18:38] what i
[1:18:39] seen and what has been told to me and
[1:18:42] how you you do whatever you want to
[1:18:44] i don't know who's going what's going to
[1:18:47] take place i do not know
[1:18:50] i just know that those seven thunders
[1:18:52] holds that mystery of the heavens is
[1:18:54] quiet amen
[1:18:56] everybody understand
[1:18:58] it may be time
[1:19:00] it may be the hour now
[1:19:03] that this great person that we're
[1:19:05] expecting to rise on the scene may arise
[1:19:08] on the scene
[1:19:09] maybe this ministry that i have tried to
[1:19:12] take people
[1:19:13] back to the word has laid a foundation
[1:19:17] and if it has
[1:19:19] i'll be leaving you for good
[1:19:21] there won't be two of us here at the
[1:19:23] same time
[1:19:25] if it is you'll increase i'll decrease
[1:19:28] i don't know
[1:19:30] but i have been privileged by god to
[1:19:32] look and see what it was
[1:19:35] see unfold to that much now that is the
[1:19:37] truth
[1:19:39] and i'm sure
[1:19:41] that you've noticed the things that's
[1:19:43] been happening this week
[1:19:46] i'm sure you noticed that little collins
[1:19:48] boy laying there dying
[1:19:55] the
[1:19:56] kingdom of god is coming
[1:20:01] amen
[1:20:09] i like this last paragraph here the
[1:20:11] kingdom of god is coming it's just
[1:20:13] becoming more from the negative to the
[1:20:15] positive as has been now that ought to
[1:20:18] choke people from justification to
[1:20:19] sanctification of the baptism the holy
[1:20:21] ghost and then here see
[1:20:23] amen the lord just becoming more
[1:20:24] positive all the time
[1:20:26] amen he says in later messages he's
[1:20:28] asked a question about what are the
[1:20:29] seven thunders he says to the seven
[1:20:30] thunders are the revelation the seven
[1:20:32] seals
[1:20:33] so we're not looking for that to come
[1:20:34] it's here
[1:20:35] amen the lord is fully it's christ being
[1:20:37] revealed in this day
[1:20:39] that's what the opening that's what the
[1:20:42] opening of the seals is is to reveal
[1:20:43] jesus christ the word amen
[1:20:46] praise the lord what a great time that
[1:20:48] we live in
[1:20:49] i'm so thankful we don't
[1:20:51] we we are living in the restoration hour
[1:20:53] we've been restored to the back to the
[1:20:55] true apostolic faith that means we can
[1:20:58] contend for the faith is once delivered
[1:20:59] to the saints
[1:21:01] hallelujah
[1:21:02] amen praise the lord
[1:21:04] um
[1:21:06] yeah so if you go listen or read christ
[1:21:09] is a mystery god revealed
[1:21:12] he will unfold what he started here
[1:21:14] because you remember the message doesn't
[1:21:15] just unfold to you as you walk with the
[1:21:18] lord it unfolded to the prophet as he
[1:21:20] walked with the lord
[1:21:22] right because it's christ revealing
[1:21:23] himself to you right as you walk with
[1:21:25] him and it was christ revealing himself
[1:21:27] to the prophet as the law as brother
[1:21:29] brown walked with him
[1:21:31] right so that's why you see there's an
[1:21:32] unfolding going on
[1:21:34] so
[1:21:35] um go listen or read to read christ as
[1:21:37] mr god revealed and we'll go into that
[1:21:39] next time next month
[1:21:41] um but yeah praise the lord see it's the
[1:21:43] end up of all things i love it how he
[1:21:45] gave it illustration it's like a rocket
[1:21:46] going off like a um we can't we can't
[1:21:49] buy them anymore but um
[1:21:50] you know fireworks yeah you fire it off
[1:21:52] it goes boom and it goes flies off it
[1:21:53] goes boom like this so it's the end of
[1:21:56] you know it's the end of time it's the
[1:21:57] end of sin it's the end of the church
[1:21:59] ages end of struggling nature end of
[1:22:01] death end of end of the devil hallelujah
[1:22:04] amen and then finally eventually
[1:22:06] eternity just rolls on but it's the end
[1:22:08] of all things and that's why there's
[1:22:10] such a big rapid change in the world
[1:22:12] right now as things are winding up the
[1:22:14] lord is fixing the place and us for us
[1:22:17] to leave this world
[1:22:19] hallelujah just as he was there working
[1:22:21] in egypt for the children of israel to
[1:22:23] leave i mean so he is fixing things for
[1:22:26] us to leave in this end time so praise
[1:22:28] the lord
