peace law that gives us everything we need Lord Lord Jesus I pray that you'll just take these words tonight Lord and this little Sunday School lesson Lord it might be for your glory though it may they not see the man Lord may they just see your soul Lord that you've given me I just want to deliver it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen good evening so welcome to brother our month's Bibles another the use of all now our role you always have to have something to look at when I when I give a class for that I like giving classes so I'm gonna do this this evening a sunday-school class if you will allow me to do that so you all must now think like thirteen year olds and it's not hard trust me I do it every day and I mean just try to see what God wants to show you so if you feel you're getting tired start looking at the clock because I only got 20 minutes I'll try to to keep to my time so let us all just stand we're just going to read a script here and we going to go to Matthew 24 being a Sunday School class and we're going to start reading from verse 42 and we're going to read down to verse 47 Matthew 24 and we'll started with 42 now I was um I had I was praying the whole week cause I get nervous when I do these things basically before grown-ups because I think I I don't want to get things wrong but you know what if I don't try what Noah so be with me if I do say anything and and you you might not agree with it just just take it to the Lord and ask him to maybe show you what he but he showed me because this is what he showed me so I praise the Lord so let's just just start thee from verse 42 he sees watch the fall or you know not what hour your Lord do with come but know this that if a good man of the house had known in which the thief would time defeat would come he would have watched and would have suffered his house to be broken up they will be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man cometh who then is faithful and wise servant whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household to give him meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily I say unto you that ye shall make him ruler over all his goods may the Lord just listen to this word you can so I didn't come to to give you bad news I came to give you good news so so I'm gonna walk around cuz I love it but walking around so the reason why I put the clocks here is these one thing that we do really struggle and keeping in this modern age and it's time it is the most valuable asset we have in this time is time because it's running out it is actually run out and and if we look in the book of Revelation steam which is actually what I wanted to do the opening scripture but I I didn't really want to do it because uh I thought maybe it gets too serious but if we go to verse five it speaks about the angel that I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth that lifted up his hand to heaven and sway by him that lever for ever and for ever who created heaven and all the things there are in and the earth and the things that therein are and this sea and the things which are therein that they should be time no longer so now I want to give you the thought there wasn't an angel that came to earth a messenger in the seventh churches now this messenger which we will read now in verse 7 because I want to go they came with the Commission and his Commission if we look at verse 7 they cease but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished as hath declared to the servants to his servants the prophets so we don't find that brother Branham came to earth for no reason yeah he is the messenger of the savin okay we all believe it I mean it's been vindicated we're not going to go down that path we just say it is what it is okay you either believe it or you don't that is between you and the Lord he will reveal more to you as you walk but there was a voice and see just before this voice that angels say time is no more so how much time if brother Branham has left this earth as a prophet 53 years ago do we actually have late so how precious is the time that we have lived so the only reason I say this now if this is where I get excited okay cuz time is given to us from God yeah so why did he put us into this earth why did he put us here you know young people we always ask why my year what am what is my goal what am i doing you know and we look at the clock and as we just look at the clock it does this wonderful thing keeps ticking no no seriously and you look at the clock and again and you go like man if I've done this for five minutes already only have 15 left you know that we've always against the clock you go to work and you sit down and you're going to start working and you find you start typing something and all the Sun is almost down so you can you do this and this and you and you keep the helping busy I'll pick when you get back you look o'clock it's lunchtime and then you in lunch time and then when you come back another guy stands you seeking your help and you're like oh we let go and at the end of the day you never get to finish your first job and you go now I have to do this at home so now your time became the work style that goes into your family time that goes into God's time do you see what happened now I'm just get stolen from us like there's nothing these these videos there's games there's all these these things that keep us busy reading too many books drinking too much coffee fellowshipping is never never again fellowship too much but it does take time with God though we're sharing testimony so we do all these things it does take time from God as well so we're doing God's work and we fellowshipping but there is also a time where we fellowship junkies has to go hey you know we have to go sleep tomorrow is work okay so I would encourage you let's see God gives us a time now I want to say why does God give us the time because we are time-tested memorials we are put on this earth to vex the devil yeah it is it is for God's glory it's for God's work all things were created by God for God so we actually just here for God so okay so now we bring it back if God is the keeper of our time and the one that gives us the time how much time do we eat back to him in your hope is a day and everybody suture or not because this week I've been searching mine and man I found I need to do a bit of a time shake seriously because I felt my of spending and my whole week five percent of my time dedicate the time to the Lord five percent I got shocked because when I'm looking at it so I get home and then there's a presentation to do now I'll share a bit of of work if I may just just because this is what happened this week I have a presentation to do a rush to presentation and in one of his Ummah go I first have to give my boys a bit of time and then about and then give my wife a bit of time and then I'll have to clean the fish tank and now I have to do a presentation and oh I forgot to do this and I run around so much that in the time I don't get to the presentation I get to my bed I go Neil I say okay Lord I'm gonna pray and I say lord thank you for this day everything is so wonderful thank you so much and so tired in a full estate or you just go lie on the benny go okay I'm gonna pray now I just want to read my buck gone and it happens now I'm thinking if God gives me time and in any and he puts me on this earth to be for him at work at his time he's actually the main employer of us what am I giving back and so I started thinking with this why does he give me time why does he give me all this time to work with because I have to be a good steward because if we look at this story there was five foolish virgins and five wise this and this story is just before Jesus goes into the parable of the five foolish and five wise virgins we sees if you're a good steward and I return you will you will reign over your home basically you will have what you have then it goes right into it and he says that if you're a foolish man this is what happens and he goes into the parish parable of the the five foolish and the five wise now the five wise took the time got the oil got ready they also they also will waiting they were also looking at the clock and this is the kicker and just watching the time pass and go man it's late it's late he's not coming but he said he'll come but it's late and the five that didn't take time to store up the oil that didn't take time to get into the wood to have a relationship with the was the one coming to marry them they messed up they actually fell asleep and and so when the loud shout came all of them fell asleep now this is the kicker all of them fell asleep so they they had the wine they took the time to store up like brother branham stored up all this lovely food for us to go and eat in the message any-any he spent a thousand how many over a thousand even more sermons he preached and he just stored up all these food for us to go in and eat and take a bit of time to help us to strengthen us so we don't fall asleep because if we don't have any time left young people if there's no more time left and that angel already declared the time is no more how much time do we have and we don't we don't come and try to scare you but if your whole day is going about what soccer balls to kick makes what am i doing tomorrow at school and man I want to play a bit more Legos and I want to watch that YouTube video and I can preach to the young people are finding a bindi so if we as young people and young people don't start throwing back that time what do we do because it's God's time so here comes the good news the time is there for a warning the reason why God put time on this earth and put us into time is it's a warning listen to this do the devil yes in Isaiah it says if in Ziya 14 verse 12 to 16 it's way way lucifer it says our son of Lucifer son of the morning and I'll go to it quickly because I got it you're my my it's easier how they ought fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how are they cut down to the ground which thou did that is weakened the nation's all thou has seed in thy heart I will ascend into heaven and I will exalt my throne above the stars of God and I will also sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north and I was seen above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the Most High so now asking you why did God put us here as to tell Satan that the iniquity that was found in his heart and the and that intention in his heart to kill and destroy what God has made will come to an end so the fact that we are in time and time is no mores to tell Satan - your time is running out there is a lake of fire you gonna burn and everyone that wants to be with you and give all these things you they'll burn with you that is God's Word he doesn't go around but see we're not scared of this time this is not for us to get kid kids if you get scared you think you're gonna run our thumb don't worry all I want to ask you is can you close that valuable time and not let it go - to finish because I don't have a lot of time but I've got another one you know the devil is on borrowed time which is fantastic okay and it's gonna come to an end and we will rejoice and the rapture is gonna happen just to let you know if anybody ever told you these no such thing as a rapture they don't read the Bible I don't read the Bible there's gonna be a day when we start walking like like just think about it we're just gonna start walking and we're gonna fill a ship and we're gonna start walking higher and this this thing called gravity there's this law that has been put there it's gonna be broken I will just start walking I will walk up and we'll see you and then after that I don't think we'll be walking anymore we'll be running you know because it will be so happy and your kids might not understand what it means but if you take that little bit of time to pray now if I can encourage you prayer is the most important thing that's where the devil got everyone he will steal your pray time yeah because that's when you actually speak to your dad you know Ruben would you like it if daddy comes up and you want to really tell me a story and I just you start telling me I got tip it's fine and I walk away would you like that because we all want a relationship with your dad in your mom so if you pray and you just go sit every night and pray now occurrence you don't do this because they don't wait upon the Lord shall renew these three you go to your bed and you go pray and you say Lord I want to speak to you tonight you don't have to say fancy things you're a child I'm a child you know I speak to God I speak to him like I speak to anyone else just with reverence I don't try fancy words I don't I don't say the Steven Church ages are here and you're the one between the candlesticks years I don't go and try to impress him he knows me I am Who I am so if I come any other way I am not who I am anyone he will just go what are you doing but if you got really news and you go on your knees at night and maybe try it maybe try to I encourage you to try but these days a kicker to this so you go sit in you pray and you say Lord I want to hear your voice I really really really want to hear your voice and I want you to speak back to me but don't go and I want you to speak back to me I mean you're not giving him chance to speak back to you and if you pray again you feel oh these are Jacek and I use the example they okay there's an elbow coming my way hit me in the left eye and that one and I remember the soccer ball in the air and so when you're praying and those type of things start happening what should you do passed him down so how do we cost down sighted young kids how can you do it how how do you cost down Satan yes resist him you tell him you put him in his place you tell him spoken word you say Satan get thee behind me in the name of our Lord Jesus don't think it because I will tell you a secret you know that Satan cannot hear what's going on in your mind it can put thoughts in need but it can't hear what you're saying God can but Satan can't so now just hear me out so you're gonna tell Satan to go and he caught you the thoughts in your head are you gonna go do you think it's gonna leave you alone and be honest do you think it's gonna leave you he doesn't even know what you're doing you ghost man is that go out of breath you know you see trying to breathe this guy you know or does he have heartburn especially when we all then in Chile from brother Andy you know but because you're sitting there trying to think you maravene is going but when you speak when you speak the words and you address him and you say Satan in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ get behind me I want to pray I don't want to be robbed by you because the moment you start speaking now you start addressing the problem now you start speaking in faith and then God comes down because you just sent Satan out the door then God comes back and says but my child called me and Here I am so then you can pray and then wait don't stop your prayer and walk out the door wait this is the most important sin brother Branham sees you know why people don't speak to God anymore because they don't give him time to speak back they want to hear the voice of God they want to hear him speak they want to hear him see everything but they never give him a chance to speak they talk and then they turn around and they walk away and he's still waiting for them he says they don't wait upon the Lord so he hasn't chosen to come down yet and you already have to do and that and we do find it us as grown-ups as well we busy we've got freezing we got a lot of things going on you start praying and I don't know if some of you do it as well but this is just me and you praying and all of a sudden I go some other thought line and I find myself waking up to the Spree and I going we did I just go and you have to start again it's a fight you actually have to start again a selca Lord forgive me I don't want to go that way but first of all I know there's a problem because the moment I'm trying to get to my lord Satan's right next you're going and think about that and what about that sister seed and what about what that brother said and did you realize this and did you see that one's child and what happened at work today and and all of a sudden you flooded with all these ideas and all you want to do is just pray you really just want to pray so I encourage you when you pray that's when the battle starts that's when the battle starts because you want to speak to your dad and every other child in that place where now call them just a child as an example like you're three three boys so that walks in the door all three of you want to see your dad first and whoever fights the base is the one that grabs the dad and he's like fine dad so why don't you fight the same when you want to speak to God so when all these thoughts come and all these people want your attention all these thoughts these enticing spirits why don't you shove the out of the way and say Lord I'm coming for you you'll find yourself in the freeze ins of gas and something happens I don't know if you ever realize that you're praying and you're praying and you're fighting all these things signs and all of a sudden just goes and you're like what just happened and that is when God has caused everything away from you and now it's you and him and now you can ask anything you want because you'll answer you but then when you in that environment when you praying when you in that spot do not come out of it just stay and wait and say Lord I'm now here all my thoughts is gone I have nothing more to ask what do you want from me what I just want to hear your voice speak to me give me instruction give me give me wisdom give me anything that you can give me that could help me to break this time because when you come back I want to expect you so here's my story to finish there was a little lady cousin and she had three and brother branham tells the story she had three cousins and and he was there like the Cinderella story okay and this this farmers rich farmer's son came and he was looking for a wife and he saw something in her and then he had a time to speak to him yeah so they had a conversation and he said man I like you okay and I'm just paraphrasing because I know the story only by the world has taken the Cinderella story and just absolutely because the bride didn't run away she was waiting so and he saved through the bride and he says to her I want to marry you and I vowed to you that I will return I promise you I promise you in this Bible I promise you saving sure changes is gonna go fast you're gonna go into the bride age I'm walking between the candlesticks all these missions just that I have the light that they shine I'm in the midst of them this is me I'm revealing myself to you personally and I am gonna come back but I want you to be ready because when I come I'm marrying you I'm not I'm not just taking you away and then dressing you up I am taking you away for good we're going to get married we do the and if you really want to go deeper in we're already married I'm just coming going to prepare our house and I'm taking it to myself but see the bride had to do two things she had to jump into action she had to listen to the word that was preached and said okay I will make myself ready and she made herself a dress and she did everything she could to be ready but see then when she stood there and the cousins looked in and go he's not gonna come and it's five minutes to twelve or three minutes to ten past he's not gonna come but he promised me no but he doesn't love you it's just things he said he's rich he's got all going for him he can choose any woman on this earth but guess what he chose her and he said I will come and she was standing there and all of a sudden her cousins were starting to laugh with her are you even in a wedding dress this is even more fun you got all this fanaticism going rapture and all these wonderful gifts of healing and you'll speak food into existence when before the squeeze comes and all these wonderful gifts you have it's nonsense in the days of miracles are past it's the same thing but we stand here we say but God sees but he said so don't make myself ready and she just stood there and all of a sudden she heard something she heard those horses coming she goes that's him that's him the seventh church age we are at the end that is him when the Prophet started speaking and all these mysteries and your Bible became a new book that's him saying I'm on my way there's a type for you there's a place for you in my scriptures I am on my way are you reading so now what we need to do is grab that time and can get it back and say lord help me to manage my time such a way that our relationship is good that when you come that I'll recognize you and that you recognize me and then we Bokke and it's done so if I can encourage you he did show up and you know what happened to the three cousins they stood like this it is true and they just go what just happened but it was too late the five foolish virgins when they came back in the doors closing can I come in I don't know you you worker of iniquities you should have been doing what I asked you to do do you think they were looking they're going home so happy they stood there going so now he gave us a lovely to call the message of the hour that points us back into the Bible hey that seems to us that that Bible is not a bunch of stories it's not a religion it is life it's a lovely so all I can encourage you if you do find yourself trying to fight back time why don't you start with putting on a table 15 minutes if you're gonna fight back time you're gonna have to do a fight it's a fight ain't gonna come easy it's a fight every inch man some days I'm so tired I speak to my dad and I'm yawning it goes man you tired I'm like 'i'm tired but see if you agree with the devil guess what your body says you're tired and in your whole body goes arms oh I just need to sleep but the moment you go oh no sorry no I'm not tired you know what I still have to meet with my Savior I still have a conversation with you I've got a couple of questions I'm gonna ask him and tonight is tonight you will see how quickly your life changes around you'll quickly walk and there will be some leaves blowing and you'll go man I remember those leaves blowing and it's it's autumn time and all the seasons are changing and you'll find yourself in a spiritual realm seeing God everywhere so I encourage you you little one if you sing a song for the Lord fight back that time that your song for the Lord seen it I'll rather sing songs for the Lord in songs for the world I'll rather read a book about the Lord in Rick book about the world ok so what I don't want to stay in the world my purpose is not to be here not saying it's wrong I'm just saying what time are you giving to this and what time are you giving to him and I encourage you if you feel yourself struggling start singing put yourself in a different exercise its public it's bubbling in my soul and go and just start creating atmosphere and your brother might come back and say uh I don't think you understand how can he keep it quiet then cause he caught it's bubbling bubbling you just keep going on fight back your time and you'll find yourself it's easier then that night when you go and pray to get into his prison but if you had if you had video games and YouTube and and all these things and soccers and footballs and rec bees and all these other stuff that comes in I know I used to be a cricket consume my mind you know and in the end of the night you want to pray you cannot actually get your thoughts back keeps going that way but it has to start already the morning you wake up so tomorrow morning when we all wake up I encourage you say it's bubbling start singing that song and if a guy tells you to shut up at school guess what you tell him just don't sing in front of him just go sing somewhere else because it is it's your song God gave it to you you seen your song if your brother sees myrn you sell so bad you go I'll sound so bad talika doesn't matter I see if we don't put in time we won't be we will miss it Vice grace or we have to give him the time okay I hope afraid that it was a blessing to you and I I hope I didn't say it was you for face and and maybe when we going to prayer just maybe thing speak to the Lord and ask him to reveal to you yourself personally because no one can really reveal to you what's going on in your heart except in how to win back your time how can I get back my time with you and what should I do because there is something that's keeping a hinderance there is something I know I'm preaching to myself and once God shows you a listen get a bit away from the work get up a little bit away from from a YouTube video get away from a lot of things that I do wrong as well then you go Lord you know what if I cut those things would you help me and once you start cutting it out he helps you you have to do that yeah praise the Lord if you're winning you still want to score some more goals it's really deal to them man and it's the same thing you know with us he minutes to go
