========================================
foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] it's good to be here this morning welcome everyone to the house of God and to this very hello Chris good to see you to this very uh special occasion which is our church anniversary weekend and you know the Lord has been really good to us over the last and we only live in we are yeah yeah 11 years um it's been it's been a journey upwards there's been no downwards everyone has gone upwards in their faith in their in their walk with the Lord and their and and everything that the Lord would want for us I believe that each person that has come under the ministry here and the the and being involved in the body of Christ has moved upward well I have anyway so I'm just going to say we all have have you good okay I'm telling the truth then because that's the way the Lord does things you know his his kingdom grows sometimes it doesn't grow as fast as what we want you know because when you look at these flowers they didn't turn up in a day they take a while to grow God's ways are not really there's no sort of quick way get rich quick sort of scheme it's just it's just solid growth in the Lord um that's that's the way the Lord does it when we look at nature that's how he does nature you know Satan tears down quickly Satan can tears think things down and in months he can tear something down that takes years and years to build but thank God that he's a wise master builder um I just had a scripture that I that it just came to my mind as I was thinking about these services and um from Ephesians 4 verses 11 and 12 and 13. because this Gathering has not been a natural Gathering where we just meet together this isn't a club you know where we've we're enrolled in some club and we just Gathering naturally but this is a supernatural Gathering with Supernatural things happening that we can't see but that we we accept by faith and that heaven have an impact and it and change our lives in ways that even that we can see naturally and manifest in our life but there's there's a supernatural element and that is Ephesians 4 11 says and he himself which is the lord gave gave to us some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers this is a supernatural thing now it's not just a natural I'll just go Rosen I'll take the job it's God gave that gift to somebody and then they the Lord directs them to end up in a place and then Minister that gift so it's a supernatural next one next verse for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ so this is happening now it's manifest in our life as we've seen it over the years but this is the this is not a club this is a supernatural thing happening next verse till we all come all and the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God and to a perfect person male or female and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so for the last 11 years this is what's been happening and it's gonna it's happened yesterday it's going to happen today and will happen tomorrow it's going to keep on happening praise the Lord let some stand and we'll just commit the service to the Lord this morning and just have a have a good time in the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we thank you so much that you have been with us on this journey Lord as we've walked this walk with you and this Fellowship Lord that I that has a special place in my heart Lord because I can see your gifts Lord that have found their place amongst us from from brother being the past to write down to everybody that does anything in this church Lord the gifts have found their place Lord and they've been you've been working through those gifts to build my life up Lord no I'm so grateful Lord that I've put myself in those scriptures Lord that I've been a recipient of of what you said would happen Lord when we accept the gifts from you and when we let them minister to our life Lord so I just thank you so much Lord for the privilege that that we've had to be a part of your work here Lord and we know that you don't start something and you just it just Peters off and it just comes to nothing Lord but if we just continue to walk with you you just continue to grow and pour out your spirit and edify us Lord so we look forward to another 11 years or 12 or if there might be only one year we don't know when you're coming would be Lord but we we know Lord that it's we're always going to move on a new Lord and this Fellowship as long as we put you first Lord and be humble Lord and accept and it's surrender ourselves to you Lord that that you'll continue to work in our midst so we just thank you for that we thank you for each one that's come here Lord to to celebrate this occasion with us today

be amen that's a it's a scary nightmare and a half Amen brother Mario's assistant name me God bless you too amen welcome amen Hallelujah I mean so Matthew 17 we're going to read down from verses one to eight it says and and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face should shine as the sun as Raymond was white as as the light and behold they're appeared unto him Moses and Elias talking with them then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elias while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid and Jesus came and touched him and said arise Be not Afraid and when they had lifted up the rise they saw no man save Jesus only that's what we want we want to have a mount Transfiguration experience this morning amen when we see Jesus only amen let's just bow heads in a word of prayer amen if you ever need you want to raise your hand to the Lord and you're glad he knows all about our life not one of us are forgotten amen not one of us are put to one side he knows everything we're going through and he's mindful of every situation amen so let's pray together gracious father we're so thankful we can sing Hosanna oh Lord we praise the Lamb that will slain but Lord You're Alive forevermore we're so thankful Lord you took our sins upon your shoulders went up Calvary Lord now them to your cross Lord you separated our sins from us as far as the East is from the West we're so thankful for that dear God we're so glad we can gather together Lord Jesus with Saints of like Precious Faith Lord father we want to ask Lord may your anointing fall on each Heart Lord may he touch each life dear God father you see every need Lord that's behind every raised hand father oh God may he meet every need for your glory Lord may we walk Lord after this day when we go our separate ways may we go with our burdens now our lighter brighter is our way Lord May there be a spring in our step Lord knowing that you're alive and glad you're in control of every situation father may you answer prayer today may have your way dear God may you be glorified now mitz father and Lord I just want to remember those who couldn't be here today because of sickness father Lord may he touch their bodies and be with them Lord be their portion Lord father may they know they're not for God no God but Lord You Lord Your Eyes Upon them too father we love you Lord we commit the service into your hands may take preeminence now dear God in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning so I want to talk about hope faith and charity I mean you've got to take hope faith and charity and then you'll see Jesus Christ glorified amen because that's what we want to do this morning that's what we want to see in our lives is Jesus Christ glorified amen not a man glorified not a church glorified but Jesus Christ himself the word glorifying so it's very important you know you're showing us here in Matthew that you know if you want to as we're ascending up the mountain yeah we're going up Mountain Zion we're going on our way to a translation of the body we know we're living in a Rapture cycle but if you want to see Jesus Christ glorified you need hope faith and charity amen says the main thing see but see we do this one thing when they looked around this is speaking of the Apostles where you know with all the power upon him they saw Jesus only and the true real believer don't care whether he's backing up a denomination or nothing about it he only wants one thing for you to see that glorified Christ makes any difference a real true Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ it didn't glorify Moses didn't glorify Elijah didn't glorify themselves didn't glorify nothing else but they send the glorified Christ and any True Believer that's what's in his heart to glorify Jesus Christ that's what he's trying to get the people to see see we're not here to try and glorify a gift amen or even a Ministry we're here to glorify Jesus Christ the word that's our host desire this morning we're not trying to point fingers to any person amen but the person I mean that's what we want is to see him glorified in our lives I'm going to emphasize that quite a lot today because man have risen up church has risen up people have risen up influences have risen up they want to glorify themselves but we're not here to do that we're here to glorify the word and because he's the king of kings and Lord of lords and I trust this morning he's your king amen he's not just your savior but he's your Lord he's your all in all amen see oh the CC Peter James and John represented hope faith and charity see when he taken Peter James and John hope faith and charity don't you see those gifted people them through hope faith and charity Hope was in James he was the one who set the church in order Faith was in Peter and charity was in John hope faith and charity and that's God's Representatives on the earth so you need all three Amen to see God live to see him glorified Hallelujah and yeah I'm trust by the end of the service you go rejoicing saying you have all three right this is not like you get the Holy Ghost and you've got to get Faith in charity and hope that's not how it works but you know so you see we need all three for God too God to move because if you just have a Burly Faith you can damage people your influence can be ruined among the people so you've got to have all three amen for Christ to be glorified see many people say they've got all the faith but if they don't have charity amen then some people can have a real Bulldog Faith they can just be you know grab it by the horns and here we go I believe listen you know real dogmatic and if you don't see it my way you're going no way you know you're not you're not going to be there that's how some people get in their mind but you know you can ruin your own influence before the people I say you're going to ruin the influence of the glorified Christ among the people if you just got barely Faith with no love with it see we don't just need faith we need love and hope with that amen we need all three to manifest I think that's the only way Christ will be glorified see we've gone well past the day of just quoting scriptures and quoting quotes and having Church order we all need those things we're going to beyond that amen but Christ has put on flesh in our day I mean he's living in a people right now I mean the bride of Christ has been adored with the winning gown the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it's more than just talking quotes and just you know arguing and fussing and fighting those days are over that dispensation is gone now Christ has come Amen to to anoint his people to manifest his word out of their lives see this is not an argument we're not here to debate things we're not here to have a collection of arguments Systematic Theology Systematic Theology is just putting it making it make that it sounds that it makes sense this message is going to more than just make sense to you I mean the Bible's got to be more than just something to make sense it's because of tradition many people say it makes sense but you're going to go beyond that amen that you see Jesus Christ alive in your life this is very important we need the anointing of God more than ever in this day they needed it All Through the Ages but it's this day we need is anointing up on our lives because the devil's anointing this world but Christ is anointing his bride aiming to overcome every obstacle amen so we can have real Burly Faith but no love with it you'll ruin your influence before the people if you haven't got love mixed with it see you've seen people real Burly you know it's like people used to say you know we're Eagles now Eagles are Terrors of the beak and they just have all the quotes and the belt buckles and all the things and they just say you know they just fuss and fight oh we're eagles they may have Eagle Faith they don't have Eagle love they don't have the love of the dove in their hearts amen but really that's just actually to me a lot of that is actually just human Faith you know it's like Peter without any discernment cutting off people's ears trying to stand for the word and you know it may look good on the outside but it just ruined you know you just ended up a great failure but thank God even though in his failure Jesus didn't forget him and you know many times we can fail trying to be a witness but Jesus didn't forget you I mean you just maybe just got to have a Pentecost Hallelujah like he did that's fine amen God will bring you through praise God Amen see people can just be so rough with it then you see what you do see doesn't it if you haven't got kindness here to move with it so what we need is hope faith and charity isn't that right hope faith and charity together God help out Church to have it like that the people to have that combination see to have that combination that means Jesus Christ becomes glorified in your life amen that's what we need so we need hope you know many times we say well you know hope your hope is a bad thing no hope is actually a good thing because hope is actually in the Bible hope is an expectation with pleasure so hope is actually an expectation God's going to move you know I trust when you drove here this morning you had a hope you had expectation I'm going to meet Jesus Christ I'm going to have more than maybe a nice time meeting other believers from around the country but God's going to come down he's going to anoint his word to my heart I'm going to walk out of these doors change that Spirit of that mind battle has been bothering more always going to be cast out by the washing of the water of the word and God's going to touch me like only he can see that is a hope I mean that's why we have you know camps you have special meetings anywhere around the world and God moves in power because people have a hope they have an expectation when they go praise God so it's good to have we we need hope but hope by itself ain't gonna work right because hope you need faith and you need charity with it see see if you just rely on Hope You Hinder faith brother Brian CC I've got all this in yellow because I want to emphasize I'm just not making these things up I trust it sticks a bit more if it's up there I mean see you just can't rely on Hope See You Hinder faith if you just rely on hope now see hope looks for something a way off but Faith claims it right now so Faith takes the expectation and brings it into the present amen just like Jesus when he is standing there by lazarus's grave and he's speaking to Miriam Martha and you know he said you know do you believe you know your brother will raise again and one of them said I know he'll raise the resurrection of the last day see she had a hope but now faith hope faith and charity was there talking to her and he was saying no no hold on I want to take your Hope from the future and bring it into the present because he said I am the resurrection and the life so right now your hope is going to become manifested in a faith amen it should be the same thing with you and I that our expectation shouldn't just be in the future but Faith brings it into the presence Hallelujah see hope looks for something way off but Faith claims it right now faith says God said so in its mind that settles it I don't care if I'm still crippled if I'm still blind if I'm still sick it don't have nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow it's mine right now God said so that settles it see that's Faith but hope said God said so and I'm expecting to get it someday you see I'm expecting someday and as long as Satan can put you off to another day see one day see hope says the conditions aren't right but faith says the conditions are right right now amen so don't just don't just be putting it's good to have a hope but don't just mat not always be tomorrow remember today was yesterday's tomorrow so have it today not always a tomorrow praise God see I'm expecting it says as long as Satan can put you off to another day it's as good as he wants that's right you'll never get it just believe you got it now it's your personal property faith is the substance of things hopeful for the evidence of Things Not Seen is that right Faith acts now it's positive there's no Maya tell you sickness and everything else when Faith steps in it's just like a snowball on a hot stove it just melts away everything goes away from Faith because Faith stands up and takes over a rule When Faith speaks everybody else keeps still that's right amen so so let let Faith get a hold of your hope and bring it into the present amen amen hallelujah see hey see we need an expectation see what if we all came and we had the same agreement that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that we love him with all our hearts that his blood has cleansed us from every sin amen that we are sinless right now in his presence amen that God has done such a complete work in our lives that we're ready for the Rapture because we are by the way if you've got the Holy Ghost you're ready amen you've got your ticket in your heart you're ready to go amen that God has made you into His Image amen that we're all on the same team we're wearing the same colors today praise God we're all cheering the same hey team Jesus is our team amen we're we're the same rallying cry that this word lives amen that he transforms lives amen that he's here to meet our needs amen hallelujah that Jesus Christ is alive the tomb is empty amen his blood was more than enough do we all agree with this amen well then then then when we when we come into that common agreement amen that brings a power into the room I mean because you can take it the negative if you know if if people resist then uh then then then it then then that power of God can't come into the room right because it's unbelief because remember Jesus had said of him he couldn't do many mighty works because of their unbelief so now what about if we take the opposite and bring Faith into the picture I mean imagine that if if that scripture was actually written a different way and he did many mighty works because of their faith amen now I believe that we're we are a people right now that have faith not just a human Faith but God's Own Faith amen so now what if we join our faith together and say Yes Lord and what do we join our faith you're going to say Lord I Want to See You Walk Among Us Lord I want to see your angels come Among Us amen you know this is how we fight our battles we're surrounded by him I mean if we just realized this morning that angels of God have gathered amen they were with you in the car driving here amen now with you when you got up out of bed this morning amen now they're gathering in an unseen realm amen because they want to watch the children of God worship and they can't join in and worship like you can worship because there is no atonement for them there's no Redemption for them they didn't know what it was like to be lost and be found Amen to be redeemed they don't know what it's like to walk with God like you know amen so they gather around though but well they're here they come to energize our faith and then God steps down into the worship himself Amen to where there's far more in this room than we can see right this morning amen if we can just believe it amen that God is here I mean he can anoint our faith to meet any right now amen that God is here to meet every need if we can just believe that if we can go beyond our week in our day and what we're facing on Monday and whatever more but you know if we can just can you what's going on here I'm on the radio I mean you know if we can just go beyond all those things and believe and let our faith loose Amen to take every promise of God Amen I believe we'll have a meeting like there's never been on the history of the Earth because God is unlimited amen God God Is No Limit amen and and the Bible says all things are possible to them that believe amen so there's nothing impossible with you amen if God is on the inside of you there's nothing impossible with you your faith is actually unlimited if you're allowed to take control Hallelujah I believe that I believe God can do anything he can go and save anyone they can be on the other side of the earth amen God can go get a hold of them they can be alone somewhere they can have a hangover somewhere they can be in drugs somewhere and God can get a hold of that person bring them to their right mind and they can come back to him I believe nothing is impossible with our God Amen do you believe it this morning amen we don't look at symptoms we look at Faith amen we look at the word of God I mean God is placing in our hearts to claim every Divine promise Hallelujah amen I believe it I I'm sorry but I've seen God do this world he just spoken to exist as the universe he just spoke into existence and sometimes we think our troubles are big trouble no God just spoke it and here it is and we're walking upon it and if he can create this world and put you here and look after your four Bears all the way down to where you are right now can you get a hold of the ones that are on your heart this morning amen Connie Connie heal the sick rays of dead Save The Lost can he do those things I believe he can amen there's no one greater than our God Amen we've seen him glorified over and over again amen may he be glorified in our hearts see what is that doing that's building the power of yes yes that's building the power of Amen so be it Hallelujah then what happens God begins to anoint our faith I mean a faith Bank begins to build oh look that's what we want to do this morning let God come down amen see what happens the first thing see it says yes the next man says yes look at it you got double power yes Triple Power yes four times yes the first thing you know it becomes a thousand pounds of years then the holy spirit moves in and confirms the word of God with signs and wonders following that's it that's what we need an expectation I mean that's what we need a hope hallelujah amen that's why it's so powerful I mean to say Amen from your heart say yes you know maybe a service goes a bit quiet maybe see the you know preacher's struggle but just say Amen we're going to pull on that gift say God pull Lord I want to pull words out of that man's mouth Lord that you put in his mouth maybe he's not even thinking about God you can speak it Hallelujah Jesus our son put to pull on the gifts of God and the song leader and the musicians special say yes Lord Hallelujah Hallelujah I believe God can do anything this morning amen now Abraham was the father of the faith we're the children of the faith he says now who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be so he had two hopes yeah there's the hope of his body that he could physically do it but then against that hope he believes the hope that God was going to do it amen so he had a hope he against hope believed in hope so he had an expectation where against the expectation of his body he believed in another ex a greater expectation that God was able to do it see so Abraham had a hope Hallelujah and he had Faith too praise God I believe he had love as well why because he stood on the gap for a lot in his family amen see against hope yet believed in hope hope is all gone yet he believed in it when hope was done dead to him Hope was dead every scientific search every resource of wisdom Hope was gone but he still believed in it what was it faith in it Faith and Hope When Hope wasn't there Hallelujah Faith and Hope when you got no hope yet yet he still believed in hopes because he said that he told me so so shall thy seeds be amen because he told me so see see because he told you so therefore you can have expectation in that I mean because his word is true amen Hallelujah see we need we need hope faith and charity you see Jesus Christ glorified now when when where when Jesus would go and raise driest daughter from the dead you know there's always a reason why he would take Peter James and John with him it wasn't just because they were the in inner circle of the uh disciples no because they were representing hope faith and charity and so whenever we have a need that arises Among Us in our family or in church we need hope faith and charity to walk into the room with us amen because when when Jesus went into driest house and driest daughter was dead you know he just said no she just is asleep she's not actually dead and they laughed at him they made fun of the Messiah so he kicked them all out except for the parents and and Peter James and John amen so why because he took hope faith and charity with him to bring a resurrection of the Dead amen and and we're looking for the ultimate resurrection of the dead the dead in Christ the raised amen so not just one here one there but all of the body of Christ Through the Ages to see them come to life I mean see they laughed at him and what he said was the word of God so when he said to them words he put them out of the house and look what um who he took with him Peter James and John love faith and charity I mean faith hope and charity Peter James and John those three that's what you want to take along with you hope faith and charity walk into the sick room I mean so when we're walking there's a need amen and there's those three in US something's going to happen I mean God is going to answer prayer I mean sometimes it may not be right then and there but God is working amen so we can have ultimate confidence when we when we lay our hands on the sick when we have a need amen that hope faith and charity is already within you God's going to move something's gonna happen Hallelujah who has that kind of a belief this morning amen God hears our prayers amen he's not he's not far away somewhere amen but he's here to meet every need so we need hope expectation we know faith is a revelation I mean this message gives us a revelation of perfect faith it puts perfect Faith within our lives by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we need charity yeah amen charity is the most important Divine love we need Divine love more than ever in this day amen because iniquity shall abound the Bible says the love of many shall wax cold amen but I believe love is getting greater among the bride of Christ it's it's on the increase it's not it's not a vessel that is just leaking out of and it's going down and down and down no it's increasing faith is increasing hope is increasing love is increasing I mean Joy is increasing the fruits of the spirit are increasing amen it's not being chewed away it's increasing Hallelujah because we can look back even a year ago and see where we were and see where we are now and sure we've been through struggles we've had battles you may have come through those doors with struggles and battles but you can look back and say the person I was I'm not that person I've I've ascended the Lord has brought me closer to him he's brought me higher in his word I mean he's been doing a work in my life Hallelujah I trust you can see that amen you may be through the worst year of your life but yet I believe you'll be closer to God Amen because God harnesses trouble and cause it to bring us closer to him praise the Lord hallelujah see charity suffereth long see love is more than a word it's an action amen it's a life amen only oh you can only have True Love by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I mean outside of that it's just human love and human love as if you do this I'll do that for you but the love of God says I'll do it for you even if you do nothing for me Hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah you see charity suffereth long is kind charity envious not charity vaunteth not herself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not our own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not an iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth it beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things see if you have Divine Love You Have Faith and Hope Hallelujah praise God they're all there amen see charity never fail us but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether it be tongues they shall cease knowledge they shall vanish away for we know in part we prophesy in part but then what that which is perfect has come then that which is part shall be done away when I was a child I spoke as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face amen now I know in part but then I shall know even also as I am known this is this day he's talking about amen and now abideth hope faith and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity amen see now when we talk about these things we don't kick the gifts out we understand that amen but God is here to take all the measure of the gifts and manifest it through his people as he sees fit to do amen we're not here just to have a dead lecture every Sunday but we want to see a living God Amen come on display see it see it's not it see it's not how it's how it's manifested up here see I could just see see someone who's anointed and teaches it can look very very dry in The Sims it's not very charismatic but as long as God takes that word anoints it to her heart then that's exactly the same as the Evangelist running the building right as long as God does what he wants to do that's perfectly fine as long as it's anointed amen the manifestation may be different but as long as God takes the word anoints it to someone does what he wants to do then that's what we're looking for I remember we need Divine love the greatest of these as Charity Hallelujah amen you see now Faith love and faith work together now we're living in a day where there is perfect faith there's perfect faith in a people yeah perfect Faith the bride of Christ has perfect Faith this morning yeah well you say I don't feel like I've got perfect Faith well faith is not a Feeling right you may feel you know there's moments that are in my life like even this past week I feel like I'm ready for a Rapture next minute I feel like Lord how are you ever going to save me you know and then Nick minute Lord why are you even wasting your time and they can be in the same afternoon you know and me and then you come out of it and then you're rejoicing again see so so we can't go by feeling see this world this world has been engineered to go by feelings well I don't feel like doing that I feel like doing that whatever feels good do it well that's crazy you know but you see the world is engineered that way now to go by feelings we don't go by feelings we go by Revelation I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God lord Jesus you died on Calvary for me you washed all my sins away you have made me in your image but irrespective of how I feel I'm still a child of God Hallelujah so I believe there's a perfect faith on the earth this morning Hallelujah perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it see we've got to just realize the word gives us perfect faith God gives us perfect Faith you don't give yourself faith see you you don't build up a faith in your own ability in your own mind no God deposits it in you right and we've got to realize this see the end time message releases a perfect Faith because it gives us a stability that we know who we are we're not guessing who we are we know who God is right we know what he's done for us and we know where he's taking us right we know what we know who the enemy is that should give us a perfect Faith see Jesus knew exactly who he was and that gave him a perfect faith see gone to drice's house race drives his daughter he could speak to the storm he could bring Lazarus out of the Grave remember heels led by Vision he was led by the father right but he knew he was the son he was his son so he knew if God is my father and I'm his son he will lead me to do what he wants me to do and that was a perfect faith and that should be the same thing with you and I we know who our father is I trust you know who daddy is I'm not talking about your natural Daddy I'm talking about your real daddy Matt yo yo your real daddy used your natural mum and dad to bring you here but he's your real father amen so I trust you know who he is and if you know who he is the reason you know that is because he wants you to know who you are see we're not see the Lord did not save us to lose us you know Chris and I are talking about the Ten Commandment film you know I mean what you just read in the Bible God God plagues Egypt brings the Israelites out then they start complaining and then God delivers to them again and then something else happens then they start complaining and then God comes on the scene again and God answers their needs and then they keep complaining there's something very wrong with that picture because they should realize that that that the second Moses walked back into Egypt anointed by the pillar of fire that realized that the prophecy that was given to Abraham and what Joseph said concerning his bones was going to happen amen that Joseph's bones were not going to be taken halfway out of Egypt dropped somewhere and they were going to be dragged back into slavery again but they should have a perfect confidence God has answered that prophecy right now and he's going to take us out of Egypt and not just leave us in the wilderness he's going to take us into the promised land amen and it seems to be the see Joshua and Caleb they were just like they weren't murmuring and complaining they are right behind the vision of God I mean because they believed amen was put in their hearts God has not brought us out to kill us he hasn't brought us brought us out just to be massacred by the Egyptians he hasn't brought us out just to leave us in the wilderness but we're going all the way through Hallelujah so that so to me Caleb had perfect faith Hallelujah I made it mastered all circumstances remember he was in the same circumstances that Cora and ether maroon and all the murmurs and complainers are in he had the same dust problems he had the same water problems he had the same desert problems he had the same he had the same view when he got out of his tent in the morning let the yeah yeah that they did he had all the same problems but they were murmuring and complaining but his faith mastered the circumstances why because his faith said I'm not staying here we're on our way to canaan's Fair land I mean I've got an inheritance in that land others what his faith mastered the circumstance it didn't change the circumstances they were still in the desert they still let sand come into the tent and go out they sell out all those things but his faith mastered the circumstance Hallelujah that same Faith was in Caleb is in you and I know Hallelujah amen you say well I don't feel that kind of way are you a Believer this morning you believe you're going in a Rapture today or this you know today this morning we can go right now that'd be fine what a great anniversary meeting that would be and we came to church and and then and then we we all disappear and it's not because we went to lunch it's because we went into Glory what what do you want to see the glorified Christ amen see him as he is amen hallelujah I trust that's your expectation I mean so Caleb's Faith mastered all the circumstances it mastered the Giants at Master Jericho at mastered every part of that Journey at mastered those Devils on his inheritance his faith mastered them he says I'm as strong now as I was when I came out of Egypt give me my Mountain so his perfect Faith actually caused all of his enemies squatting on his promise to be destroyed and he took possession of that promise Hallelujah amen see no matter what it is that Masters it now just watch when you believe anything do anything and you've got faith in what you're doing I believe we're living in a day that we're not just as doing a stab in the dark kind of a Christianity we know exactly what we're doing I mean because we know the heart of God we know what he loves what he doesn't love we know how to please him we know how to approach him we know how to walk with him right the message is revealed all these things amen so we can have confidence have faith in what we're doing I mean when you take God in his word we have faith in what we're doing we're not just hoping that the promises got to work right we know it's going to work amen if it works for me it'll work for my children amen if I work for this person to work for the other person right because Faith Masters all circumstances do you have confidence in what you're doing you know I trust you out of faith that how you raise your family it's not I hope this turns out fine you have a confidence God's going to get a hold of my kids they're going to have a Revival the next generation is going to have a have an earth-shaking Revival of the Holy Ghost amen they're going to see God move in power it's not going to be my testimony only what's going to be their testimony they're going to see God live amen like I saw them live they're going to see him live if you have confidence that you create an atmosphere when you have family prayer that God's going to step down into your until your family all the time or maybe you're at the table maybe you're just talking and you're just under expectation that God will step down why because we've created our homes as a sanctuary for God Amen that he would feel pleased when he drives up your driveway knocks on your door he's like I'm so glad I'm so glad I'm home I can dwell here I can spend time with these people because they're my people and I love them they love me Hallelujah I trust that's how you are in your heart amen Hallelujah praise God see we we're going to have faith in what we're doing amen well what about the other person I you can't answer for what they did maybe it didn't work for them but the word still works for the believer amen and you know just because it doesn't appear to work doesn't mean it's not going to work in the end right Hallelujah just because our families go Wayward doesn't mean it's not going to work we're going to have confidence we're to look beyond what we see and look to the promise of God Amen we can't get discouraged remember just unusual discourage you you know I was thinking what if we made a website of good news yeah I'm just talking about natural news now this is good news today Herald or whatever paper it'll just be an old lady Timmins got her cat back from the tree it'd be like one article around the whole world you know there won't be much good to fill a big way because the news is all negative right it's all negative and but but problem is the news is looking at the circumstances right and if we look at circumstances we will get discouraged right but if we look at the promise it looks beyond the circumstances and it will bring actually the promise into manifestation but don't get discouraged amen by what you see amen because remember as I said last Sunday we're all going through a trial but if you go through a place you don't stay there amen now I just want to I want to drop this in this is um you know because many times we think Lord are you actually do you see me in my plight do you see me in my struggle and I was thinking about there with this is the account won't read it but you know Hager when she's when she's with child you know by Abraham and then of course Sarah hates her and and and kicks her out and then she begins to be in distress saying you know what is what is going on here and then and then the angel of the Lord actually found her by the Fountain of water in the wilderness amen and you know and then the angel says what are you doing here what's going on and then he said you know return to your mistress and submit yourself and then you see but then the promise was still given to all uh multiply those seed exceedingly and then now because she felt like she was she was just Cast Away that she wasn't cared about that she wasn't going to be looked after though she was actually she was carrying a part of the promise it wasn't the promised son but it was a son of Abraham right and and then yeah we know Ishmael he'll be a wild man you know his hand is against every man and all those things but then she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her thou God seeth me four she said have I also looked uh have I also looked after him that saith me therefore the well was called burla harore behold it is between kadish and burrito so that's the well of the god that seeth me now I just put this in because you think about this is Hager she's having a son by Abram not even part of the promise really but yet God was still mindful of her that she was not forgotten so now if she wasn't forgotten how much more you and I the bride of Christ the Sarah group right how much more of the Sarah group this morning amen of Hagar who was the mother of the wild man amen was looked after by God she has provided for she didn't perish how much more the Sarah group the bride of Christ I mean we've got to remember this God sees us many times we feel like he doesn't hear our prayers he doesn't understand what we're going through he does God see from the oldest of us to the um oldest to the youngest amen he sees all of us he cares for you we must not forget that see the devil would like to think we're not important with God but we are very important with God his focus is actually upon you and I in the same time Hallelujah amen now see Faith believes that God will work it out just go back to the yellow again I don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see that's Faith how do you know how's this going to happen I don't know but God said it's going to happen I just have confidence in God will work it out according to his riches and Glory I don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see it Masters all circumstances and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith isn't what God is in a God Who is the very essence of love Faith and love worketh together brother I said it's like a husband and wife faith and love that's why you can't just have a Burly Faith or a hope you need hope faith and charity because faith and love work together if you love God you have faith in God right it's more than just a trust in someone you know no if you love someone you trust someone far more than if you didn't love them but yet you could trust them right workers faith and love works together now we know we live in a day where men will be a lovers of their own selves right so their love is on the wrong person their love this is a this is an age of self-care we'll look after number one can be the body can be what you eat can be can be free time it's all me me kind of a life but we're going to realize that we don't actually live here for ourselves we live here for one another we live here for God we come to worship you know we are here to worship and serve the Lord and we know when we get married our all of our old lives should basically be kicked to one side we can't be a bachelor that now has a wife and maybe some children part of the old boys club that does the same old hobbies and doesn't make room no you got to get rid of all that stuff God can bring it back surely but you can't expect to live the same old life now that you're married because your life is for your spouse not for you amen so we don't want to be lovers of our own selves right lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God see people say well they love the Lord but if they love Pleasures more see with where's the love balance now I'm not saying you can't have hobbies you can't have pastimes go have fun but love the Lord more than anything right it doesn't mean you can't play sport you can't do whatever but what is your main focus if your main focus is your free time you've got a your focus has got to be changed right having a form of Godless but denying the power from such turnaways is actually talking about Christians in the end time but I believe I'm looking at a people that that that aren't fulfilling this part of the scripture I trust you not anyhow amen AC I'm just going to come back to the faith in love we're just doing a bit of a Segway you see now Abraham ye uh know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same other children of Abraham and the scripture foreseen that God would justify the Heathen through faith preach before the gospel unto Abraham saying and thee shall All Nations be blessed so then they the which are of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham I mean so if you're of Faith you're blessed with faithful Abraham now Abraham was given a promise when he when he was going to authorize the cup on the altar but but but um you know the angel stayed at his hand that thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies amen so this is a blessing that comes with with um Abraham is that his seed or his offspring will possess the gates of his enemies now we know that this seed is ultimately Jesus Christ he possessed the gates of all the enemies it was more than just Samson carrying the gates of Gaza amen ripping them off the hinges taking the doorposts with and carrying them away but you know that was just a shadow of what Christ would do amen because remember our lord Jesus he possessed the Gate of sickness he possessed the Gate of death he possessed the Gate of culture he possessed a gate of religion he possessed the Gate of sickness he possessed the Gate of unbelief he possessed every gate that can be named he possessed that gate and because he possessed that gate we can possess every gate too amen that we don't have to put up with the devil and his nonsense but we can possess the Gate of the enemy and when you possess the Gate of the enemy you actually come and con in control of us going out and is coming in Hallelujah amen there you stand this morning their stands the Church of the Living God I don't care what anyone else says what the doctor says what anything what the unbeliever says you can move more than a match we can more than a match for anything that comes along we're Abraham's seed and we shall possess the gate to our enemy no matter what the enemy is God gave the promise see that's the that's the keynote of the whole thing God gave the promise amen that's that was theirs their possession healing is your possession salvation's your possession the Holy Ghost is your possession uh there's great thousands of preachers so forth in Atlanta that says it's not so but the Seed of Abraham knows it's so they weighed right in possess the gates of the enemy God said they wouldn't they believe it because it's a promise his seed shall possess against the enemy now you'll go through testing and trials but you'll possess every gate it doesn't matter what everyone else is amen we will possess every gate now now from time to time I see Christine sitting there and she's underlining scriptures in the Bible with her red pen I'll say what are you underlining so one of them was this last night the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God now this could probably be a whole sermon but he's going to drop this in the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those which are revealed belong with belong unto us and to our children forever amen to the secret things are Gods but if they're revealed they belong to us amen so now the word has come fully open in this day the Seven Seals have opened I mean the Thunders have uttered their voices which is the revelation of Seven Seals All the word has been revealed the Rapture has been revealed overcoming power has been revealed Amen to walk with God has been revealed in this end time all that Christ is he's poured into the church I mean so there's no promise in the Bible that's actually a secret anymore that pertains to you and I it's all been revealed so if it's been revealed it belongs to me and to our children forever amen so it's been revealed to you at belongs to your children Amen to the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been revealed to you and if God has met you and changed your life that belongs to your children if if he's healed you once healing's been revealed to you it belongs to your children amen of overcoming a mind battle has been revealed to you by his word it belongs to your children amen though because remember we've got to realize that the spirits we fought our children will fight amen amen the same things they go we've gone through okay they go through as well and maybe rebranded just like telecoms now spark and vodafone's now one New Zealander still the same old company different logo different color different whatever buzzwords and things still the same old thing and it's like the devil he you know he just rebrands you you know you take music from what like like the Beatles and it's just rebranded down I don't know who's trending hashtag now on Instagram I'm not interested but it's the same spirit just rebranded right maybe different it's a different genre Same Spirit just being rebranded right so the same spirits that we fought there fought amen but have been revealed to us so we can overcome it and we did and we'll be revealed to them Hallelujah praise God why it belongs to us Amen to every every Divine promise that has been revealed to us belongs to us and to our children forever hallelujah amen so now we can Rejoice we say Lord It's been revealed to me therefore it's going to be revealed to them it belongs to me then it belongs to them and as I say don't look at what you see with your fire you're with your eyes what you hear with your ears from them that's irrelevant look at the promise of God hallelujah look Beyond those things now it's amazing how how the Apostle Paul he uses this phrase in Galatians twice I'm going to go into it that you know for in Christ it says so for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision so use that phrase twice and we're going to go into it now so so from Christ Jesus neither circumcision so keeping the law or uncircumcision not keeping the law availeth or actually does anything but Faith was which worketh by love this is what avails in Jesus Christ it's Faith which worketh by love so not just a Burly Faith by itself not just a hope and a faith but Faith which worketh by love so if you want Faith to work in your life how does it work by love amen see now this is from the dictionary I'll throw it up there so it means to be operative to be at work to put forth power so if you weren't Faith to be at work in your life or put forth power love Jesus love the Lord worship Him from your heart be thankful for what he's done amen if you want Faith to have effect or to display one's activity so your Works remember works as Faith expressed love the Lord this is what avails this is actually what gives prevailing power as that Faith worketh by love see it's not it's not it's not dressing just the right way conforming to a standard outwardly doing things because you're told to that's not what avails that may be part of the truth but what really avows his faith with workers by love because if you love the Lord you will obey his word right and no one has to make you do anything it's out of a free will Lord I love you I'll do whatever you want me to do you want me to get baptized in Your Name Lord Jesus praise God if you want me to put away those TV thing you know streaming device yo yo everything on the internet because TV is old-fashioned word these days you know that music whatever more I'll get rid of it Lord because I love you I want to please you because you gave all your life for me so I'm going to give all my life to you Hallelujah amen now here's the next one but God forbid that I should Glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision of ours anything nor uncircumcision so we read that just before but a new creature and as many as walk according to this rule peace Beyond them and mercy and upon the Israel of God so upon the people of God so what avails in Christ is actually being a new creature in Christ see that's why the devil wants to keep the new birth from us that's why people actually afraid of being born again but she must be born again because when you become a new creature in Christ then overcoming power comes into your life then the love of God then the faith of God come into your life this is what gives you see it's not just conforming outwardly to the message that's not going to get you anywhere it's just going to make you miserable I remember when you really meet the Lord yourself and are born again amen that's when a joy comes into your life and you and you don't get bored serving God you love him amen you rejoice in him see so what avails or gives power is being a new creature see many times you think Lord you know you come into a trial your faith is put to the test you begin to think Lord how can I overcome this thing how can I live a life that's pleasing to you how can I you know get through this and we think well if I pray enough if I read enough if I listen enough if I do this enough buy fast enough all those things are fine but that's not what avails it's being a new creature in Christ that's one of our trust you're all with me this morning see we've got to put out of our minds that it's our own human works that that'll mirror anything with God how many draws night to us but but when God when a testimony is all done and gone and we're and we're rejoicing and the fruits of it there can't be any of us saying well we did something right you know Moses couldn't say well I open the Red Sea no God told him to raise the staff who who parted the water who made it like dry land it wasn't Moses it was God it wasn't Moses it even brought the plagues he just got told what to do and he did it right the same in the New Testament it wasn't you know you know it wasn't um you know Jesus said I do nothing but what the father shows me that I do likewise you know so any anything that's Supernatural we can't say well we did it you know who who actually anointed your faith to do it right it was God who initiated it who initiates a testimony God initiates the testimony who manifests the testimony God manifested testimony and that's that's why it's not that's not us and our human ability that can that can actually gain a favor with God and Lord you know I've done this therefore you've got to do this we know you love him you're a new creature in Christ you're one of his children right and that was what avails so he's trying to get the Galatians out of this idea of keeping the law in an outward Conformity and all keeping rules and so on he's saying those things won't avail you know you want to be overcoming Christians things those things won't help you none as being a new creature in Christ or faith working by love amen now as many as Walker so so we do have a rule to follow as many as walk according to this rule that's why I underlined it Hallelujah you know we say we don't follow rules well we follow this one yeah yeah right is that okay amen so as many as walk according to this rule peace Beyond them because there's a peace that comes into your heart when you realize I'm a son or daughter of God I can't God can't lose a part of himself and I'm part of him hallelujah amen you know if David could say I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor has seed begging bread I mean that still applies to me I mean quiet because the Lord has made me righteous amen so if the so if the righteous have never been forsaken in the Old Testament how much more in the New Testament right now praise God and mercy so peace and mercy shall be upon you yes yes and upon the Israel of God or the people of God so if you walk according to this rule what is it that being a new creature in Christ that's what avails in Jesus Christ not what I do outwardly only you know it's not trying to conform and do all these things but it's an inward change of the heart a birth right then peace and mercy rests upon you but also upon the church who wants that to be so amen that you can you can just walk with God and people can have trouble and no peace and they just come to the atmosphere the Holy Ghost peace comes upon them and they're wondering Lord can I ever be forgiven for this thing can I you know will you forgive me and then mercy comes upon them amen praise God and walk it you know there's just one hell say two direct one's life to live so so if if you realize this avails it will keep you on the straight and narrow Hallelujah amen but you see now the problem is people come to a spot where they say well the Revival's been so great you know God's done so much how can we keep this going well really the best way is um is this and Faith worketh by love that's what keeps the revival going you love the Lord you want to walk according to his word you know that you know what avails is I'm a new creature or a new creation in Christ Jesus but then people come to a spot say how can we keep this going and now this was I've been meaning to put this in for a few Sundays but here it is finally to talk about the Ephesian age now when it's all over watch and see if they're in the woods says after God has moved walking and living in it if they go through all the other and then don't walk in that word they can say they love God but their lives tell another story I wonder if John didn't see a lot of that before he died people saying they loved God but not a Banger's word oh Ephesian Church something's happening to you someone is trying to either add to that word or take from it but they are doing it so subtly that you can't see it they haven't made a move so big um you can see it but um out there in the open it is undercover and they are bringing in it by the way of reason and human understanding and it will take over unless you refuse it go back to Pentecost before it's too late he says but as usual people don't heed God's warning that Revival fire built upon the sacred word is so wonderful and the manifestation of the spirit so blessed that a little fear Creeps in and a Whisperer in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on that is when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and Whispers look you have the truth now see that it doesn't get lost organize it set up your Creed of what you believe put it all in a church manual they do it they organize they add to the word they die just like Eve did for taking one wrong word it's God's word that brings life it's not what we say about the word that comes but it's what God Said now don't put this on some church somewhere some organization this can be families it can be individuals we say now let's just standardize this this this faith you know starts off God moves in power you're so glad you get saved you begin to rejoice and just walk with God and you're like man how can I keep the momentum of this all right he say well I just I just I just I just make this little Comfort Zone in the word and this is me and this is what I believe and that's it that's putting it on a church manual right but we're gonna just keep walking with the word keep loving God remember Faith worketh by love I remember what he started he's gonna finish amen so we don't need to add or take away or make a man-made way doing things we can just walk with the word and God will vindicate his word amen see it's not what we say about the word that counts it's what God Said so I'm kind of we're kind of losing time here so I'm just going to skip a few things now remember the new birth is what avails you know we were at Christie and I were at um so so annalize and Gabriela were at the um in the zone cross-country you know all these kids running and you know I was thinking about David and Goliath because you know when kids are young parents look at the potential potential in their children they're going to be the biggest and the strongest and the tallest and the smartest and the most beautiful and the most whatever you look at these things and if you think about it how opposite David and Goliath would have been Goliath always would have been the tallest in the class right he was never the you know he would have been the first pick in every basketball game he would have been the first pick in every rugby game it would have been the first pick he would have been the anchor in the tug of war because you look at the class photo be like this thing Goliath like this right you think man he's going to be a soldier he's going to be our champion he's going to be the greatest one all of all of all of the Philistines would have thought this about Goliath because they saw the potential on the outside but then David was the opposite to Goliath I mean he wasn't even invited to the feast when the prophet Samuel came to Jesse's house he wasn't even included and maybe being brought before the prophet he was the one who wasn't thought of he wasn't considered none but yet when God saw him he said this is my king he had a potential that no one else in Israel saw but God saw the potential and not just the potential like it might actually happen but a potential as in he is the king already rights is not a could be maybe it's a in Jesse's house is my king how this he already was a king on the inside of the inside of him amen so so here are the actually the two champions of the world at that time one looked like a champion you often wonder what happened to the armor Bearer guy winners you know he probably got fired man he couldn't he couldn't hold the shield high enough anyway I just think about that but you know one's a champion on the outside one's the one who'd be considered the other one wasn't even considered even by his own family I mean but God looked beyond what his family saw what Israel saw and said that's my king that's a giant killer right there that one's going to take all the promised land he's he's my king and it's the same thing with you and our friends the world wouldn't wouldn't consider us for nothing amen we we're not the smartest we're not the tallest we're not the strongest we're not the most athletic we're not the richest amen but God looked beyond everything amen and he saw a seat of predestination on the inside of you and said these are my giant killers in this day I mean they're going to conquer every devil I mean they're going to overcome every trial they're going to walk out of this world Victorious robe to my righteousness washed In My Blood Holy white cause God look Beyond this and looked in here and said that's my bride oh this and then what does that do that now avails when you realize that David when he was anointed king he knew I'm going to the throne God will get me there sure God had to take him through many trials and distresses and heartaches and whatever more but he got to where God would have him go Hallelujah and so what happened that that that's why he could stand there and says who is this uncircumcised Philistine that defies the armies of the Living God hallelujah and it worked because it was revealed to David I'm the son of God I've been anointed I was just anointed by a priest I've been anointed by a prophet amen and he prophesied over my life and God's spirit was with me from that day on he's with me now and this uncircumcised Philistine is gonna die Hallelujah and that's exactly what happened wasn't it amen so we you know because why he was actually a new Creature if I put it that way in Christ Jesus it wasn't his height that Avail them it wasn't you know it wasn't how smart he was you know it's like brother bam says about you know Saul would try and give him his armor and he said that ecclesiastical jacket didn't fit a Son of God right so he couldn't you know he said he hadn't proved those things but he approved his sling he proved his stuff so you know the things that have been proved in our life we should keep using them until God gives us a different weapon amen what because he didn't use the sling after that I remember but but we can draw from testimonies of the past have God delivered there he's going to deliver now why because Faith worketh by love and I'm a New Creation in Christ Jesus Hallelujah amen see it was revealed to David it was revealed to David the others of Israel knew it could be done but it was revealed to David that's the big difference see you need faith hope and charity amen amen and you'll see Christ glorified in every situation amen see if it's revealed to you it doesn't matter how big the enemy may be Amy notice when it's revealed David become Fearless he says today I'll cut your head off amen that's our God by grace and that crucial moment when decisions had to be made that same God that produced The Grace in that day and drop that seed of faith in that little Hunchback looking boy being in his heart that same God in this crucial moment could take that woman from the wheelchair that man this woman had that child that little grain of faith is revealed to you I don't care how long it takes it's gonna happen amen because faith is not based upon a time Hallelujah now this word transfigured we're going to go back to our opening text correctly um then we're going to close this word transfigured this is where we get the word metamorphosis from so it's a transformation from one thing to another like a caterpillar to a butterfly so there's a transformation took place there amen now we are going through a transformation as well now if you want to go through that transformation you know you need the Holy Ghost you need God to live in your life more than a religious spirit more than saying you believe a Doctrine but God must come in and live and transform your life right and then now you go with hope faith and charity up the mountain right you're ascending and it will make you have a Transfiguration or a transformation see we're going from glory to glory I don't know if you've realized that the world has fallen but we're ascending right that's why the world seems more foreign to us now than it did maybe a year ago things are crazy yeah I was thinking we're 11 years old now you know imagine if we sat down 11 years ago and said let's imagine what the world's going to be like in 11 years I tell you what our guesstimation and what we see would have been poly polar opposite would probably say well we're going to be in the Rapture by then you know we're going to be in glory that would have been real good but you know we're here for a purpose right we're not here just to occupy time every day is important but you see now we're going see we're going see and so now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord a change into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord that word changes that word transfigured metamorphosis so we're going through a metamorphosis we are being transformed by the life that's within us remember a caterpillar has a life within it to transform it into a butterfly it doesn't go get something else and then become a butterfly it's already within it to change right that change is already within it and it's the same thing with you and I the change the body changes already within you I mean the Rapture is already Within You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't have to go see it's not you get the Holy Ghost then you've got to go get rapture in faith no if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have rapturing faith the prophet says that when you get the Holy Ghost you have everything you need for your Earthly Journey Hallelujah so we can walk with confidence right now amen that I am Rapture Ready if you have the Holy Ghost I'm Rapture your Rapture Ready that should take off a lot of pressure why because what are vowels in Christ Jesus being a new creature hallelujah amen so same thing with us that transforming power just like a caterpillar has got transforming power we have transforming power amen that we've been changed from glory to glory Hallelujah so if you have that you have hope faith and charity you'll see Jesus Christ glorified every day in your life and in the change of the body amen Hallelujah I'm just going to finish with these couple of quotes and we'll then I will finish okay and so it is today we don't try to be some big persons I mean we don't care what the people say about us our our name ain't nothing it's his name our life it's nothing it's his life it's his power not our power and there's only one thing that we love to do is to see him glorified hey man and how can it be when he's glorified in Us by his resurrection that's in us we we see him represented again as he was today did you get that see our desire is not to be glue is not to be glorified our desire is not some big name our desire is not to boast some church or make more in the Sunday school or try and bring in hogtied push and offer a picnic party or bring Stars buttons or something or something else like that that's not our desire our desire is to see him glorify glorified not with self-pride but in us our lives to prove he's alive and living in US hey Macy's now if I can get myself out of the way so in William Branham is not even thought of and you not even thought of till we see Jesus glorified Among Us amen so we don't think about our problems and what we're going through and maybe our humanity and all those things but we forget all about that that's why it's so important forget all about yourself and just worship Christ the Lord amen till we see Jesus Christ glorified among us see see him that's our desire that gives us quickening power it gives us joy to know that we are with them both flesh and bone of him being the Bride of him and seeing his same Vindicated methods proving in us that he's now risen from the dead see Hallelujah that's what we want to see today and not just today amen but we want to take hope faith and charity and see Jesus Christ it'll cause you to see Jesus Christ glorified you won't help but see him glorified in your life if you have those three in your heart amen and that's what I want to see isn't it and we're not here to celebrate a church we're here to celebrate an anniversary of God's Saving Grace and what God has done in our lives not just here but but all of us amen God has been working in our lives these past 11 years amen we've gone through troubles and trials and hardship and different kind of things but God has brought us through them all I mean so we can Rejoice this morning amen that we could say Lord we have seen you glorified and we want to see you glorified again Lord we don't want to see ourselves glorified we don't want to say let's make three Tabernacles amen but we want to see Christ amen see him only holy away because now see Moses represented the dead in Christ Elijah represented the raptured raptured Saints writes of hope faith and charity will actually cause you to see all the redeemed body when's that Gathering going to be in the meeting in the air man you'll see them because we are part of them Hallelujah you're glad this morning you can have it at home you have it on in your school on the job in your car
