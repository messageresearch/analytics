[7:24] 10 years old and
[7:27] he brother ian had a framing shop in
[7:29] gisborne and and
[7:31] me and my his son luke were little mates
[7:34] you know we'd be kicking around
[7:36] and we had a job of getting these little
[7:38] clips
[7:40] and putting them on the back of a frame
[7:41] you know on a picture frame there's a
[7:42] small clip that you can
[7:44] use to hang the frame on the wall it was
[7:47] um
[7:48] our job to pull out a clip and put it on
[7:50] the back of whichever size of the
[7:52] the backing board was going in a certain
[7:54] size frame you know so there were piles
[7:56] of frames
[7:57] and we would go click
[8:00] click click and we would joke around
[8:03] that when we go to sleep that night all
[8:04] we're going to hear is
[8:06] click click but i think we got paid did
[8:09] we get paid brother
[8:12] i can't remember we probably got lunch
[8:15] or something
[8:16] [Music]
[8:17] but they were good times they were
[8:19] really fun times we had
[8:21] there so um yeah but we also sister
[8:24] esther milan as he speaking of it so
[8:26] where is esther she's there good morning
[8:28] sister good to have you here
[8:30] [Applause]
[8:32] and we have got
[8:35] i've seen you before bro but have you
[8:38] been here before
[8:39] i've seen you somewhere
[8:40] [Music]
[8:42] andy i've seen you before somewhere bro
[8:44] i don't know where but brother andy is
[8:46] here
[8:48] welcome amen
[8:53] oh yeah
[8:55] [Music]
[8:57] brother karma good good to have you here
[8:59] bro
[9:00] [Applause]
[9:03] brother kubin said we may have seating
[9:06] issues this morning
[9:06] you know because he was sort of doing
[9:08] the number of the guests that were
[9:09] coming in that and he's squeezing people
[9:10] in
[9:11] i've always thought that's a good
[9:13] problem to have
[9:15] people have said oh we need to get a
[9:16] bigger church you know to
[9:19] make sure there's enough seating but
[9:22] i've always thought no let's make it so
[9:23] there's not quite enough so then
[9:24] there's a bit of pressure to get to
[9:25] church early and get a seat you know and
[9:27] if you don't get a seat you've got to go
[9:28] out the back
[9:29] and you know i turned up a bit late
[9:34] the reason why is because in our
[9:36] christian walk we always have to be
[9:38] grateful
[9:39] you know if we are grateful in our
[9:41] attitude towards what the lord's done
[9:42] for us we won't get complacent
[9:44] you know it's very easy to get to be on
[9:46] to become ungrateful
[9:48] it's like the bible says the full soul
[9:50] loathes the honeycomb
[9:52] you know like when you're so full you
[9:53] you someone you offer
[9:55] you're offered something nice and you're
[9:56] like oh man i just can't be bothered
[9:58] that's that's not interesting to me at
[9:59] all
[10:00] but it says to the hungry soul every
[10:02] bitter thing is sweet
[10:03] not like we're hungry souls but you know
[10:05] we should be hungry for the lord all the
[10:06] time and
[10:07] and just a little warsaw from the lord
[10:09] is like wow this is so good you know
[10:11] and our attitude is if our attitudes
[10:13] like that will always be the spirit of
[10:14] god will always be moving amongst us
[10:16] if that's our attitude so there's
[10:19] something like a seating issue will
[10:21] create that bit of a i want to get there
[10:24] so yeah that's good um so you let's
[10:27] let's stand this morning
[10:29] oh and we've got um we've got
[10:33] pedro and ilana down the back welcome
[10:35] [Applause]

[41:57] i mean luke 16 13 to 15
[42:00] to begin with amen says here
[42:05] no servant can serve two masters for
[42:07] either he will hate the one and love the
[42:09] other or else he will hold to the one
[42:11] and despise the other
[42:13] you cannot serve god and mammon and the
[42:15] pharisees also who were covetous heard
[42:18] all these things
[42:18] and they derided him and he said unto
[42:22] them
[42:22] ye are they which justify yourselves
[42:25] before men but god knoweth your hearts
[42:28] for that which is highly esteemed among
[42:30] men is abomination
[42:32] in the sight of god amen we're going to
[42:34] go to acts
[42:35] 26 read
[42:38] um from acts 26 8 down to verse
[42:43] 19 here
[42:53] i mean so acts 26 and 8
[42:57] says so this is this is paul speaking to
[43:00] king agrippa speaking of his
[43:01] uh experience on the road to damascus
[43:04] says why should it be thought a thing
[43:06] incredible with you that god should
[43:07] raise the dead
[43:09] i really thought with myself that i
[43:10] ought to do many things
[43:12] contrary to the name of jesus of
[43:13] nazareth which thing
[43:15] i also did in jerusalem and many of the
[43:18] saints did i
[43:19] shut up in prison having received
[43:21] authority from the chief priests
[43:22] and when they were put to death i gave
[43:24] my voice against them
[43:26] and i punished them oft in every
[43:28] synagogue and compelled them to
[43:30] blaspheme
[43:31] and being exceedingly mad against them i
[43:33] persecuted them even under strange
[43:35] cities
[43:36] whereupon as i went to damascus with
[43:38] authority and commission from the chief
[43:40] priests
[43:40] at midday o king i saw in the way a
[43:43] light from heaven
[43:44] above the brightness of the sun shining
[43:46] round about me with them which journeyed
[43:48] with me
[43:49] and when we were all fallen to the earth
[43:51] i heard a voice speaking unto me
[43:53] and saying in the hebrew tongue saul
[43:55] saul why
[43:56] persecuteth thou me it is hard for thee
[43:58] to kick against the pricks
[44:00] and i said who art thou lord he said i
[44:02] am jesus whom now persecuteth
[44:04] but rise and stand upon my feet for i
[44:07] have appeared unto thee for this purpose
[44:10] to make thee a minister and a witness
[44:12] both of these things which thou has seen
[44:14] and of those things in which i will
[44:16] appear unto thee
[44:17] delivering thee from the people and from
[44:19] the gentiles unto whom now i send thee
[44:21] to open their eyes and to turn them from
[44:24] darkness to light
[44:25] and from the power of satan unto god
[44:27] that they may receive forgiveness of
[44:29] sins and inheritance among them which
[44:31] are sanctified by faith
[44:32] that is in me whereupon oh king agrippa
[44:35] i was not disobedient
[44:37] under the heavenly vision amen let's
[44:40] just bow heads in a word of prayer
[44:41] let's commit our lives unto the lord
[44:43] this morning gracious heavenly father we
[44:45] want to thank you
[44:46] lord we knowing that the same god that
[44:48] lord you're the same one that met the
[44:50] apostle paul on the road to damascus
[44:51] lord is the
[44:52] same god we have met lord we want to
[44:54] thank you you are alive today and i just
[44:56] want to pray lord as we have read
[44:58] from your word we know anyone who can
[45:00] read lord can read
[45:01] your word but lord it takes you the
[45:03] great divine author to step forth and
[45:05] make it live and
[45:06] that's why we gather this morning as you
[45:08] come and take your word anchored into
[45:09] our hearts it would manifest itself for
[45:11] your glory
[45:12] lord we pray you take the service under
[45:14] your divine control lord may you just
[45:16] have preeminence in every life and
[45:18] lord when we leave these doors after the
[45:19] service is done may we be transformed
[45:21] change renewed lord fill with the holy
[45:23] spirit lord
[45:24] may the lost be found oh god the sick be
[45:27] healed lord jesus
[45:28] lord may those who are tormented have
[45:29] peace father may you grant it in jesus
[45:32] christ's name we ask
[45:33] amen amen god bless your friends you may
[45:36] have your seats this morning
[45:37] i'd like to take the opposite of uh
[45:40] of yesterday last last sunday where
[45:43] we're looking in the scripture and and
[45:45] and from
[45:47] this account we read in luke how you
[45:49] know the lord jesus
[45:51] speaking there he was the fountain of
[45:52] eternal life and he and
[45:54] his big hearts cry was come unto me all
[45:56] ye that are heavy laden and i will give
[45:58] you rest but the scribes and pharisees
[46:00] they had
[46:01] crafted their own religion their own
[46:03] idea of god and they basically said to
[46:05] him
[46:05] what we believe is god and you're not
[46:07] god and they turn down eternal life so
[46:09] i titled it you know don't tell me but
[46:12] so so this morning i'd like to take the
[46:14] opposite i like to
[46:15] talk about tell me i mean because you
[46:18] know we don't want to
[46:19] hold on to our traditions hold on to our
[46:21] beliefs if they're contrary to the word
[46:23] we need to get rid of those things and
[46:25] hold on to the word and the word only
[46:28] i mean so so we're going to look into a
[46:30] people who who instead of they said
[46:32] don't tell me and they were lost they
[46:33] said tell me
[46:34] amen and they went into glory because
[46:36] you know really at the end of the day
[46:38] we want to believe like a believer we
[46:41] want to believe like a saint we want to
[46:42] repent like a saint we want to be filled
[46:44] with the holy ghost like a saint
[46:45] we want to see god live like a saint
[46:47] amen we want to die like a saint we want
[46:49] to go to heaven like a saint
[46:50] that's what we want to do amen amen so
[46:52] you know we're not here just to go
[46:54] through a religious motion this morning
[46:56] but we're here to be come in contact
[46:57] with almighty god
[46:58] hallelujah i feel his presence is in the
[47:00] building amen right now
[47:02] so it's amazing the apostle paul
[47:05] you know every believer has a past and
[47:08] every
[47:08] every believer's past is not a good past
[47:10] it may be very bad in some eyes it may
[47:12] be not so bad in others eyes but
[47:14] you know it's amazing the apostle paul
[47:16] where where he would you know the things
[47:18] he would write about they weren't theory
[47:20] to him
[47:21] it was a revelation it was an experience
[47:23] and when he would he
[47:24] you know when he would begin to write to
[47:25] the ephesians in ephesians chapter 2 and
[47:27] he would begin to tell them how
[47:29] how we have been quickened by the holy
[47:30] ghost we've been made alive in christ
[47:32] how they went from dead traditions they
[47:34] were once walking according to the
[47:36] prince of the power of the year they are
[47:38] once dead and trespasses and sins but
[47:40] now they're alive in christ
[47:41] this wasn't theory to him he did not
[47:43] just sit there in some ivory tower and
[47:45] think of some nice thing to tell the
[47:46] church
[47:47] he lived that out you know many times we
[47:49] think of people who dead and
[47:51] and sins maybe they're drunks maybe
[47:53] they're drug addicts maybe
[47:54] you know you know they're into all kind
[47:56] of vices of the world but the apostle
[47:57] paul was in the same kind of darkness
[47:59] you know
[48:00] sin is sin it all has the same payment
[48:03] it all receives the same wages
[48:05] wages of sin is death right it doesn't
[48:07] matter what man
[48:08] quantifies it by sin is sin it doesn't
[48:11] matter how bad it looks how good it
[48:13] looks
[48:13] you get all paid the same at the end of
[48:15] the day amen but i don't want to
[48:17] have the devil for my boss i don't want
[48:19] to have unbelief for my boss i want god
[48:21] to be my boss because if he's my boss
[48:23] he'll pay me right
[48:24] and that payment is eternal life holy
[48:27] it's a rapture amen that's
[48:29] that's what we're looking for amen today
[48:31] so when he said you we've been quickened
[48:33] who are dead in trespasses and sins
[48:35] when in time past you walked according
[48:37] to the course of this world
[48:39] according to the prince of the power of
[48:41] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[48:42] the children of disobedience
[48:44] he knew what it was like to walk
[48:46] according to this world he was a very
[48:48] well-liked man he was very well thought
[48:50] of in his
[48:51] in his in his religious circles he would
[48:53] say he was the pharisee of the pharisees
[48:55] it was it took a lot of human effort to
[48:57] be a pharisee a lot of rules they had to
[48:59] keep a lot of religious duties they had
[49:01] to
[49:01] maintain so he was very well thought of
[49:03] he walked according to the course of
[49:05] this world
[49:06] but he was walking he realized according
[49:08] to the prince of the power of the year
[49:10] which is actually the devil
[49:12] and his angels he was being led amen by
[49:15] demon power but he came to a place in
[49:18] his life where he realized
[49:20] where he met the god he believed he was
[49:22] serving
[49:23] what a shock it would have been he
[49:25] thought he was serving great jehovah
[49:27] he thought he was doing god a service by
[49:29] finding all these fanatic christians who
[49:31] believe some
[49:32] you know this man was the messiah but he
[49:34] was nothing but beelzebub they were told
[49:36] and
[49:36] you know they stole his body and uh you
[49:38] know making all these wild claims
[49:40] they just got off the deep end some
[49:42] funny sect had risen up they thought you
[49:43] know he thought but
[49:44] you know he thought he was doing god a
[49:46] great service i'm going to find these
[49:48] people i'm going to stop this
[49:49] cancer spreading upon the earth and i'm
[49:51] going to put an end to this thing and
[49:53] you know he was very devout he did a
[49:54] very good job
[49:57] if we could look into the unseen realm
[49:59] if we could go back 2
[50:00] 000 years ago and look at the apostle
[50:02] paul in the flesh outwardly he would
[50:04] look like a devout man
[50:05] but if we could look into the unseen
[50:07] realm amen his
[50:08] his soul was as black as hell amen he
[50:11] was
[50:12] being led by a religious spirit that was
[50:14] his that was his lot
[50:16] but down on the inside of the inside of
[50:18] him i mean was a predestinated seed
[50:21] i'm so thankful it doesn't matter what
[50:23] our first birth produces
[50:24] you know there was a lot of things
[50:26] stacked up against the apostle paul
[50:28] amen but he was predestinated by god it
[50:31] didn't matter what he was doing god
[50:33] didn't change his mind about him
[50:34] he was ordained to be the first church
[50:36] age messenger he was ordained to write
[50:38] the new
[50:39] new testament you know lay that yo put
[50:42] your place grace and the law the right
[50:43] way and all those different things you
[50:45] know
[50:45] he was ordained for the job so so it
[50:48] doesn't matter this morning
[50:49] where you are right now you can play the
[50:52] part but what's on the inside of you
[50:54] i mean you know but you know we can be
[50:56] as lost as lost can be yeah
[50:58] the apostle paul was lost as lost can be
[51:00] he didn't look lost he looked very found
[51:02] and in his mind before he met the lord
[51:04] he would have thought i i know exactly
[51:06] who i am
[51:07] i'm of the tribe of benjamin i'm a
[51:08] circumcised jew i'm a pharisee
[51:10] you know look at look at all the things
[51:12] i've done but when he stepped
[51:15] into the presence of god
[51:18] he was so stunned he said lord who are
[51:20] you
[51:22] you know he believed that the god of
[51:23] moses you know he was serving that god
[51:25] but he found out he wasn't serving god
[51:27] at all
[51:27] he was serving some church and that's
[51:29] the worst thing we could ever do is
[51:31] serve some religion forget it
[51:33] we're here to serve jesus christ the
[51:34] word and that's the one we should serve
[51:36] and obey
[51:37] amen because he's our god you know
[51:39] brother brown poses the question did
[51:41] your church die for you
[51:42] did your denomination die for you who
[51:44] died for you jesus died for you the word
[51:46] you should serve him
[51:48] amen you know
[51:52] he was a very devout man concerning zeal
[51:55] persecuting the church this is his own
[51:58] this is his own testimony before he met
[52:00] the lord this is in
[52:01] uh philippians 3 concerning the church
[52:03] pers i mean
[52:04] concerning zeal sorry persecuting the
[52:07] church touching the righteous which is
[52:08] the
[52:09] of the law blameless so
[52:12] he was someone can be very religious
[52:14] very christian even kind of person but
[52:15] then
[52:16] if their nature has not been changed
[52:18] they're still walking with
[52:20] the devil you know you don't just kind
[52:23] of
[52:23] merge into this thing you've got to meet
[52:24] him you've got to meet the lord
[52:27] and he's here to be met he's not a nice
[52:29] idea he's a reality he's a person
[52:32] hallelujah but he had to come to a place
[52:35] that
[52:35] all those things but what things were
[52:38] gained to me
[52:39] those i counted lost for christ so
[52:42] he said yet doubtless i count all things
[52:44] for loss for the excellency of the
[52:46] knowledge of
[52:47] christ jesus my lord for whom i have
[52:49] suffered the loss of all things and do
[52:51] count them but dung
[52:53] that i may win christ so he took all of
[52:55] his religion and his tradition and his
[52:57] four best religion and everything and he
[52:59] said well i'm just going to count this
[53:00] but dung
[53:02] that i might win christ he didn't
[53:04] justify himself but i've been a good jew
[53:06] and this so therefore your god will wink
[53:08] at my ignorance and he'll you know no he
[53:09] counted all but dung
[53:11] and we have to count our old life done
[53:15] you know it's amazing the things that
[53:16] people people can have uh
[53:18] very good memories of what they used to
[53:20] be and that's a dangerous thing
[53:22] because if they have a good memory of
[53:24] what they used to be really still in
[53:25] their heart to do it
[53:26] and they've really just come under just
[53:28] the influence of god but they haven't
[53:29] surrendered it to god
[53:31] and you'll find that thing that they
[53:32] still have fond memories of
[53:34] will pull them right back into it but if
[53:37] they counted it but done
[53:39] i mean god chops them free
[53:42] hallelujah and that thing won't drag
[53:44] them back no more because they've been
[53:46] got a hold by god hallelujah
[53:50] amen so we should never i'm glad i'm not
[53:52] a
[53:53] sinner anymore i'm glad i'm not some
[53:55] drunk i wanted to be a professor of
[53:57] chemistry i'm glad i'm not on that road
[53:59] nothing no but nothing wrong with if you
[54:01] want to do that but you know
[54:02] the lord told me you're worshiping your
[54:04] education i let go of it
[54:06] i still finished my studies but it
[54:07] wasn't my all in all what's your all in
[54:09] all today should be the lord amen
[54:13] shouldn't be your past whatever
[54:14] struggle's going on
[54:16] how god's greater than those things
[54:19] hallelujah
[54:22] now can you imagine let's just go into
[54:24] the apostle paul's life
[54:26] again he would have been real happy with
[54:29] himself
[54:30] when those finely crafted written
[54:32] letters were were
[54:33] were authorized by the high priests
[54:36] maybe his seal was put
[54:38] upon them they are rolled up and they're
[54:39] placed into his hands he said saul
[54:41] now you've got authority i'm
[54:43] commissioning you
[54:45] to go and find the christians wherever
[54:46] they are these people
[54:48] and put them into prison and no doubt he
[54:50] would have held that letter because now
[54:51] he's got all of his authority
[54:53] all of that authority's been placed in
[54:55] his hand the power oh my i've got
[54:57] authority now
[54:58] and he would have been so excited
[55:01] because really that demon power was
[55:02] driving him
[55:04] yeah it's amazing how people get so
[55:05] angry against the truth
[55:07] he didn't just sit there and say well
[55:09] it's just another sect like pharisees or
[55:10] sadducees or herodians
[55:12] but there's something consumed in him
[55:14] i've got to stop this thing
[55:16] much like people today but all
[55:19] see before he met the lord it was a
[55:21] church sending him
[55:23] it was the high priest sending him and
[55:26] so he had all this behind him he thought
[55:28] no doubt you know
[55:29] what an incredible thing i've got the
[55:32] authority
[55:33] of the of the high council in jerusalem
[55:35] they have commissioned me to go do this
[55:37] job
[55:39] but then he came to a place where he met
[55:40] the lord on the road to damascus
[55:42] and he realized that the ones
[55:44] commissioning him to do the job was the
[55:45] wrong one to commission with
[55:47] you know the authority he had was just
[55:49] man-made authority it wasn't god-given
[55:51] authority
[55:52] and now he traded he traded
[55:56] being commissioned and sent and given
[55:58] authority from a man on earth
[56:00] he traded all that to be commissioned by
[56:03] god to be sent by
[56:04] god now it wasn't the high priest there
[56:06] in jerusalem backing him up and now god
[56:08] the
[56:09] the real high priest was now backing him
[56:11] up hallelujah what what an incredible
[56:13] assurance that would have been to swap a
[56:15] natural leadership
[56:16] and a natural backing up to a
[56:17] supernatural leadership and a
[56:19] supernatural backing up
[56:21] we can have the same kind of thing
[56:22] happen to us i mean you know god has
[56:24] sent you two
[56:25] you know we're not just here just to
[56:26] fill up you we're not just here to go
[56:28] through the motions
[56:29] we've been commissioned by almighty god
[56:32] go into all the world and preach the
[56:33] gospel
[56:34] cast out the devil wherever you find
[56:36] them i mean that this word would put on
[56:38] flesh it's not
[56:39] you know you know when you know when god
[56:42] sends a people
[56:44] he doesn't equip them just with an
[56:45] argument you think the apostle paul he's
[56:48] a very scholarly kind of man
[56:50] he's a very devout man he studied many
[56:53] long hours
[56:54] to get to his position but he would come
[56:57] to a place where he would tell
[56:59] the thessalonians now if i can
[57:02] find this here he said for our gospel
[57:04] came not unto you and word only
[57:07] but also in power and in the holy ghost
[57:10] and in much assurance as you know what
[57:13] manner of men
[57:14] we were among you for your sake see told
[57:17] them this is not just an argument i'm
[57:18] bringing you
[57:19] i'm not just bringing you a collection
[57:21] of words that maybe tickle your ears
[57:23] i but this gospel that we have comes in
[57:25] power
[57:26] and that root word of that power and
[57:28] greek is where we get the word dynamite
[57:30] from it's going to be an explosion go on
[57:32] the bits of the devil are going to go
[57:33] flying all over the place when someone
[57:35] pushes the igniter down
[57:37] hallelujah power and in in the holy
[57:40] ghost and in much assurance
[57:42] so now he had someone to back him up
[57:44] that would actually come down
[57:45] and vindicate what was being said it
[57:48] wasn't just
[57:49] idle words coming forth but now god
[57:51] would prove what this man is saying this
[57:53] is my gospel
[57:54] it's not his idea it's not someone
[57:56] else's idea
[57:57] he says i didn't get this by learning
[57:59] i've got to buy revelation from jesus
[58:00] christ
[58:01] hallelujah and it should be the same
[58:03] thing with you and i there should be a
[58:04] life
[58:05] of the word backing up your life
[58:08] it should be more than just living and
[58:10] playing the part but god himself
[58:12] should back you up in everyday life amen
[58:15] if you're surrendered to him and he's
[58:17] living through you he should back up
[58:18] your life
[58:20] i believe that hallelujah because we
[58:23] should be able to say the same things
[58:24] the gospel that i preach you say well
[58:26] you're not a preacher but you hear
[58:27] deliver sermon
[58:29] live a sermon before you preach a sermon
[58:31] your life should be a living bible
[58:34] hallelujah so there's got to be the holy
[58:36] ghost backing you up
[58:38] i believe in the supernatural gospel
[58:41] we're being restored back to a
[58:42] supernatural gospel but this word is put
[58:44] on flesh
[58:46] hallelujah you know brother branham when
[58:48] he went to india
[58:50] he was met by the christian
[58:53] denominations there he says when i
[58:54] landed
[58:56] he said this he said what is the gospel
[58:58] you say it's the word not only
[59:00] paul said the gospel came not through
[59:02] word only but through the power and the
[59:04] manifestation of the word by the holy
[59:06] ghost to teach the words like reading a
[59:08] newspaper
[59:09] when i landed in india the methodist
[59:12] bishop and many of them came out to meet
[59:14] me they said brother branham
[59:15] we've heard of these things we've
[59:16] preached we preach the word we know more
[59:18] about theology perhaps and all you
[59:20] americans put together
[59:21] because the bible is an eastern book and
[59:23] that's right said but we want to see
[59:26] someone anointed with the holy spirit
[59:28] that can make it live again
[59:29] that's it we want somebody who can
[59:31] produce what the bible says it will do
[59:34] we otherwise we want to see faith that
[59:36] was once delivered to the saints
[59:38] there you are now jesus didn't go along
[59:40] like a totem pole
[59:42] jesus said one day passing through a
[59:44] group of people healed a man laying on a
[59:46] palate walked away and left the audience
[59:48] why they didn't ask him probably
[59:49] questioned him about him packing this on
[59:52] a sabbath day so forth he said verily
[59:53] verily i say unto you
[59:55] the son can do nothing in himself but
[59:56] what the father doeth
[59:58] what he shows the son the son does just
[1:00:01] what the father says
[1:00:02] in other words i can't do nothing till
[1:00:04] the father shows me a vision
[1:00:06] that i do what the father tells me to do
[1:00:08] that was the faith
[1:00:09] that was the faith that was delivered to
[1:00:11] the saints
[1:00:12] amen and then he would be interviewed by
[1:00:14] all the major religions in india
[1:00:16] that the hindus the sikhs the jains the
[1:00:18] buddhists there and they all had their
[1:00:20] time telling
[1:00:21] telling the prophet how little
[1:00:22] christianity was and how jesus was just
[1:00:24] you know there's no power in him and
[1:00:26] then he just said to them gentlemen
[1:00:29] you've all spent your time telling me
[1:00:31] how how how little my god is
[1:00:33] we're having church tomorrow you're
[1:00:34] welcome to come they all turned up
[1:00:37] i mean the prophet was standing there
[1:00:39] they're about to have a prayer line he
[1:00:40] saw a vision of a blind man that was
[1:00:42] going to receive his sight right in the
[1:00:44] right right being prayed for in front of
[1:00:45] them all and because he had that vision
[1:00:47] he had confidence
[1:00:48] and a man came up who was a sun
[1:00:50] worshiper he he spent all of his time
[1:00:52] staring at the sun and it made his eyes
[1:00:54] totally white because he thought he'd
[1:00:56] get some kind of
[1:00:57] i don't know whatever some kind of
[1:00:58] religious thing from looking at the sun
[1:01:00] and made him blind
[1:01:01] and then so brother brown addressed all
[1:01:03] the audience he said we can see this
[1:01:05] man's blind that's not you know you
[1:01:07] don't need any special thing to see that
[1:01:09] but now if your god is god if your god
[1:01:12] is god there was there was
[1:01:14] imams there muslims there you know
[1:01:17] buddhist sikhs jains all of them they're
[1:01:19] hindu priests
[1:01:20] he said if your god is god if you really
[1:01:22] worship the creator god
[1:01:24] come and pray for this man and that
[1:01:26] he'll receive his sight
[1:01:28] silence he said now to show you jesus
[1:01:31] christ is god
[1:01:33] hallelujah he started praying for the
[1:01:35] man the reason he could do that he said
[1:01:37] i felt like mount carmel on
[1:01:38] i mean i mean i mean elijah mount carmel
[1:01:40] harlow because there's a challenge going
[1:01:42] on you know god will back up his word
[1:01:44] god will back you up if you have a
[1:01:46] challenge comes against you
[1:01:47] other because it's not just the
[1:01:48] prophet's stories it's our stories too
[1:01:51] that same god is alive today hallelujah
[1:01:54] and so he prayed for the man his eyes
[1:01:55] were healed he went out there screaming
[1:01:57] shouting
[1:01:58] hallelujah beca and and brother abraham
[1:02:00] said to them
[1:02:01] if this man's eyes are healed you ought
[1:02:03] to give your life to jesus christ right
[1:02:05] now
[1:02:07] hallelujah why because people want to
[1:02:09] see the gospel in action
[1:02:11] they don't just want to hear an argument
[1:02:13] we've had 2 000 years of argument but
[1:02:15] what about a god living
[1:02:17] what about a god that's come out of
[1:02:18] history what about a guy that's put on
[1:02:20] flesh and a people
[1:02:21] what about a people that don't just talk
[1:02:23] about a message and quotes and put them
[1:02:25] together in arguments and different
[1:02:26] things
[1:02:26] what about the god that lives i mean
[1:02:28] manifest those quotes through a people
[1:02:30] takes the scripture makes it live that's
[1:02:32] what people are looking for
[1:02:34] people are looking for reality not an
[1:02:36] argument but reality
[1:02:37] hallelujah because it's just like the
[1:02:39] man who was born blind
[1:02:41] they couldn't say anything because the
[1:02:42] man was standing right there after jesus
[1:02:45] healed him
[1:02:46] hallelujah and we have testimonies in
[1:02:48] this room of a living god
[1:02:50] harlow that he is not dead he's not a
[1:02:52] history
[1:02:53] amy but he's a living god we've come in
[1:02:55] contact amen with the burning bush
[1:02:58] himself yeah what i love hallelujah is
[1:03:01] that there comes a place
[1:03:03] you know only certain things can quicken
[1:03:05] seed
[1:03:06] certain seed the apostle paul
[1:03:09] he had been at the feet of gamalia he'd
[1:03:12] learned incredible things according to
[1:03:13] the pharisee tradition that didn't
[1:03:15] awaken who he was
[1:03:16] i mean he'd been into the temple if i
[1:03:18] could put it that way that didn't
[1:03:20] quicken who he was god had moved on
[1:03:22] he had seen the passover lamb slain that
[1:03:24] didn't awaken him to who he was
[1:03:26] i mean because it couldn't quicken what
[1:03:28] was on the inside of him
[1:03:30] but then when he was on the road to
[1:03:31] damascus hey his mind was
[1:03:33] a certain way but god just overrode what
[1:03:35] he his plans you know
[1:03:37] you know god overrides the devil's plans
[1:03:40] hallelujah he actually intercepts you
[1:03:41] the devil has certain plans for your
[1:03:43] life or different
[1:03:44] people's life god just steps in and says
[1:03:46] oh no
[1:03:47] devil you can come this far but no more
[1:03:49] you can't go any further than this and
[1:03:51] he just overrides the devil's plans
[1:03:53] he cancels the devil's plans hallelujah
[1:03:56] and then so the devil's plans was paul
[1:03:58] or saul you're going to go to damascus
[1:04:00] you're going to be real successful
[1:04:02] destroying this thing
[1:04:03] and then you're going to move on that
[1:04:04] was the devil's plans but god said no no
[1:04:06] no you've got you think you're going to
[1:04:08] damascus for this but you're going to
[1:04:09] come and meet me
[1:04:10] i've got a i've got a divine appointment
[1:04:12] with you on the road about this spot on
[1:04:14] this hill
[1:04:15] hallelujah that was god's plans and the
[1:04:17] devil's plans got cancelled
[1:04:20] hallelujah because he came into the
[1:04:22] contact with the only thing that could
[1:04:24] awaken him
[1:04:26] that could quicken that seed on the
[1:04:27] inside of the inside of him was a god
[1:04:29] who gave that predestinated seed
[1:04:32] hallelujah now moses
[1:04:35] moses was the same kind of guy
[1:04:38] hallelujah
[1:04:40] he was raised in pharaoh's palace
[1:04:43] he had been in the presence of pharaoh
[1:04:45] he could have been the next pharaoh
[1:04:48] amen he he basically had his foot on the
[1:04:50] throne
[1:04:51] he was being groomed for the job we're
[1:04:54] gonna be careful what grooms us
[1:04:56] we don't want the world to groom us we
[1:04:58] don't want the world to condition our
[1:05:00] thinking
[1:05:00] i mean we don't want to be conditioned
[1:05:02] with this unbelieving spirit of the h
[1:05:04] i mean that just wants an instant answer
[1:05:05] all the time that can't wait upon the
[1:05:07] lord we don't want to be conditioned
[1:05:08] with that
[1:05:09] i mean we want to be conditioned by the
[1:05:10] holy ghost himself i mean
[1:05:12] he was conditioned a certain way his
[1:05:14] mother told him you know
[1:05:16] you're you're going to be the serpent
[1:05:17] bruiser you're going to be the deliverer
[1:05:19] you are the one god's going to use to
[1:05:21] bring our people out of
[1:05:23] out of egypt just like was told to to
[1:05:26] abraham that his seed was going to
[1:05:28] sojourn in a strange land 400 years
[1:05:30] we're going to bring them out with a
[1:05:31] mighty hand
[1:05:32] i mean they knew that someone was going
[1:05:35] to be ordained to do that job
[1:05:37] hallelujah it won't just make god come
[1:05:39] down and they do nothing no
[1:05:41] god was going to raise up somebody to
[1:05:43] bring a deliverance
[1:05:45] hallelujah and then so even his mother
[1:05:47] told him these things because
[1:05:49] by faith they had moses they saw him as
[1:05:51] a proper child
[1:05:52] they knew they knew that he was going to
[1:05:54] be the one to do the job
[1:05:56] but that even that didn't quicken him it
[1:05:59] it arose
[1:06:00] and you know it awakened a desire in his
[1:06:01] heart
[1:06:03] but he needed the one who gave the
[1:06:05] promise the one that gave the prophecy
[1:06:08] to fulfill the prophecy
[1:06:10] to come to him personally and make it
[1:06:11] known to him actually i have
[1:06:13] commissioned you to do the job
[1:06:15] i remember the thing is even in his own
[1:06:17] human desire
[1:06:18] all he ended up doing was killing one
[1:06:20] egyptian and then running away
[1:06:22] that was his success he had all the
[1:06:24] military knowledge he had all the
[1:06:25] science knowledge even the religious
[1:06:27] knowledge of
[1:06:28] you know of the egyptians but even with
[1:06:30] all that and he was the man who was
[1:06:31] ordained to do the job
[1:06:34] but he had to step into the presence of
[1:06:36] the one who gave the promise
[1:06:38] he had to step into his presence amen
[1:06:43] hallelujah now if i just find where i am
[1:06:46] i kind of think if i print my notes i
[1:06:47] can find where i am but
[1:06:48] it doesn't seem to be working anymore
[1:06:51] amen he says brother brahm says and hear
[1:06:52] his voice
[1:06:53] moses had been a military man and he
[1:06:56] thought
[1:06:56] that the way he was trained as being a
[1:06:59] military man that he could just kill
[1:07:01] them egyptians off with his hand just as
[1:07:04] good as god
[1:07:05] of what god did did you ever think of
[1:07:07] that everyone condemns moses for killing
[1:07:09] one man
[1:07:10] and he come back down there with with
[1:07:13] anointing of the holy ghost and killed
[1:07:14] the whole thing
[1:07:15] nobody said nothing about it he slew all
[1:07:17] of pharaoh's army but god was in it
[1:07:20] god wasn't in the first one you know
[1:07:23] we've got to be careful that god's in
[1:07:25] our first one and our second one
[1:07:28] and when moses just chucked full of
[1:07:30] church theology
[1:07:32] he was to be the next pharaoh we find
[1:07:33] him still not knowing god
[1:07:35] but one morning on the back side of the
[1:07:37] desert an old man of 80 years old his
[1:07:39] whiskers hanging way down low
[1:07:41] he had seen a burning bush and he turned
[1:07:43] aside to see what was going on and when
[1:07:45] he got near the bush he heard a voice
[1:07:48] god had to quiet him quieten him for
[1:07:50] forty years
[1:07:52] before he could ever speak to him and we
[1:07:54] don't have and we won't stay
[1:07:56] quiet 10 minutes so god can speak to us
[1:07:58] with all the rumble and bumble we have
[1:08:00] of this day and yet moses after 40 years
[1:08:03] stood there in the presence of that bush
[1:08:05] and that one voice that called him he
[1:08:07] knew more about god in five minutes
[1:08:10] after that than all the 80 years of
[1:08:12] training had taught him
[1:08:14] it made a different man out of him
[1:08:17] why because that burning bush quickened
[1:08:19] a life it made him come to life to
[1:08:22] actually do what he was ordained to do
[1:08:24] hallelujah now that same god has come
[1:08:27] down in this end time
[1:08:28] remember jehovah of the old testament is
[1:08:30] jesus christ of the new
[1:08:32] right same god amen hallelujah so that
[1:08:35] same one who is there with moses
[1:08:37] is the same god with us today that's why
[1:08:40] paul when he looked up saw that bright
[1:08:41] shining light says who are you lord
[1:08:43] that word lord means supreme one because
[1:08:46] he wouldn't just call anything lord
[1:08:47] because he's a scriptural hebrew
[1:08:48] believer
[1:08:49] so when he saw that light something in
[1:08:51] his mind said i've i've read about this
[1:08:53] somewhere
[1:08:53] and then after that experience he spent
[1:08:55] three years down in arabia
[1:08:57] searching the scripture to see who it
[1:08:59] actually met
[1:09:00] so he took his experience and matched it
[1:09:02] with the word of god
[1:09:03] and that's what we have to do i don't
[1:09:05] want to make my experience match
[1:09:07] you know i want my experience to match
[1:09:09] god's bible i mean that that way i will
[1:09:11] know my experience is scriptural
[1:09:13] because i can take it back into the word
[1:09:15] and that's the main thing the holy ghost
[1:09:16] will always point us back into the word
[1:09:18] and will never point us to
[1:09:20] a creed he'll never point us to a church
[1:09:21] or some idea of man it can never do that
[1:09:24] i mean but the holy ghost himself will
[1:09:26] point us back into his word
[1:09:28] because the holy ghost inspired people
[1:09:30] to write this word he is the author of
[1:09:31] this book
[1:09:32] hallelujah so and and and that's why now
[1:09:36] that's why the apostle paul he was so
[1:09:38] you say flabbergasted by that experience
[1:09:41] but he began to find out
[1:09:43] that this one this jesus
[1:09:46] was the god of his fathers
[1:09:49] hallelujah amen
[1:09:53] now when god when god quickens us
[1:09:59] he wants he makes us alive to the
[1:10:01] promise of
[1:10:02] of our day he doesn't make us alive to
[1:10:05] our past
[1:10:07] he kills our past the blood of jesus
[1:10:09] christ annihilates our past
[1:10:11] i mean it's not something that god just
[1:10:13] has in a cupboard to bring out and hold
[1:10:15] against you when you be naughty
[1:10:17] that's not how god operates no but the
[1:10:19] blood of jesus christ cleanse us from
[1:10:21] all sin
[1:10:22] i mean actually annihilates our past
[1:10:24] hallelujah that that now
[1:10:25] just like when moses crossed the red sea
[1:10:28] they could look back and they could see
[1:10:29] their tormentors their their oppressors
[1:10:32] their slave masters were dead in the red
[1:10:34] sea
[1:10:34] so their past the things that tormented
[1:10:36] them became drowned
[1:10:38] it's the same thing when we can when we
[1:10:40] pass through the blood of jesus christ
[1:10:41] and we can look back and see those
[1:10:43] tormenting spirits we can see that
[1:10:45] unbelieving spirit those generational
[1:10:47] curses
[1:10:47] we can see all those things that were
[1:10:49] beating us down make us think we'll
[1:10:51] never make it we can never overcome we
[1:10:53] can never
[1:10:53] we can never conquer we can look back
[1:10:55] and see it dead
[1:10:57] when miriam turned back an 80 year old
[1:10:58] woman and shot dead harlow she took up a
[1:11:00] tambourine
[1:11:01] and she began to worship and praise god
[1:11:04] she began to thank god because the
[1:11:05] reality of it struck her soul
[1:11:07] that one that was whipping me the other
[1:11:09] day he's floating face down in the sea
[1:11:12] oh he's dead he can't torment me no more
[1:11:15] i'm on my way to canaan's fair land
[1:11:17] hallelujah it caused a real worship
[1:11:19] although you know how pentecostal
[1:11:21] worship's the oldest worship there ever
[1:11:22] is
[1:11:23] it's not a new thing it didn't come in
[1:11:25] and it didn't come at azusa street in
[1:11:27] 1906. this has been before the
[1:11:28] foundation of the world
[1:11:30] i mean because job was asked where were
[1:11:31] you when the sons of god the morning
[1:11:34] stars shatter for joy
[1:11:35] holy but now it's just being inspired
[1:11:37] expressed in flesh
[1:11:38] now it's just come down into flesh it's
[1:11:40] not now in the mind of god anymore
[1:11:42] but now it's been manifested in flesh
[1:11:44] amen when john saw the lamb take the
[1:11:46] book
[1:11:47] hallelujah when he saw the lamb step
[1:11:48] forth claimed the inheritance of adam's
[1:11:50] fallen race
[1:11:51] i mean he began to shout i mean the
[1:11:54] silence
[1:11:55] was ended the crying was over the
[1:11:57] despair was gone
[1:11:59] i mean he wasn't weeping and crying no
[1:12:01] more oh yo he wasn't crying because he
[1:12:03] didn't find himself worthy that's not
[1:12:05] what it means
[1:12:06] he was crying because he saw no one was
[1:12:08] worthy
[1:12:09] sure there were angels that had never
[1:12:11] fallen they could have been worthy but
[1:12:12] they weren't a kinsmen to you and i they
[1:12:14] weren't a man
[1:12:15] otherwise he saw no man all the prophets
[1:12:17] were there because it's symbolic of all
[1:12:19] the redeemed through the ages
[1:12:20] so moses was there joseph was there all
[1:12:22] the righteous all the way down through
[1:12:24] were there
[1:12:24] but they we're all born lost
[1:12:28] doesn't matter how righteous we are
[1:12:30] we're all born by sexual desire all born
[1:12:32] with a fallen nature
[1:12:34] but one came and he wasn't born that way
[1:12:37] he was our kinsmen but he wasn't born by
[1:12:39] sexual nature he was created in the womb
[1:12:40] of mary
[1:12:41] hallelujah he became our kinsmen and
[1:12:43] then an angel said to john don't weep no
[1:12:46] more
[1:12:46] john the season of weeping has come to
[1:12:49] an end
[1:12:50] you don't need to cry and lament no more
[1:12:52] you don't have to be worried is this
[1:12:53] whole thing in jeopardy or not
[1:12:55] but the lion of the tribe of judah has
[1:12:57] prevailed
[1:12:58] and he looked and he saw stepping forth
[1:13:00] was a bleeding bloody lamb
[1:13:02] holy that it overcome wrestled with and
[1:13:04] overcome hallelujah and then he began to
[1:13:06] rejoice and then now
[1:13:07] the lamb took the book and brother ram
[1:13:09] says it's the most sublime act in all
[1:13:11] all of scripture because that book is a
[1:13:13] symbol of you
[1:13:15] hallelujah he says the same as as as
[1:13:17] boaz claiming ruth
[1:13:19] taking her as his bride hallelujah and
[1:13:22] then so so so now the time of crying
[1:13:25] has come to an end he saw the lamb open
[1:13:28] the book
[1:13:29] hallelujah and brother braham says that
[1:13:30] john must have got next to himself
[1:13:32] because he saw
[1:13:32] beyond the curtain of time himself john
[1:13:35] saw john up in eternity
[1:13:36] and he began to rejoice realizing i've
[1:13:38] made it hallelujah
[1:13:40] i'm in my theoph and he's already over
[1:13:41] there oh that my eternal body is already
[1:13:43] over there
[1:13:44] if this body be dissolved we have one
[1:13:46] waiting in the heavens
[1:13:47] we already have it waiting in the
[1:13:48] heavens it's not maybe it's there
[1:13:50] it's waiting but it's calling you and i
[1:13:53] i mean that's why when the word came
[1:13:54] your way you surrendered to it
[1:13:56] god filled you with the holy ghost
[1:13:57] because you have a body waiting in the
[1:13:59] heavens
[1:14:00] and to me if we could just keep that
[1:14:01] before us amen all problems should just
[1:14:03] vanish away
[1:14:04] all trouble should go you say i'm on a
[1:14:07] big trial but you've you're going to
[1:14:08] make it
[1:14:09] i mean you're going to make it you've
[1:14:10] got eternal representation in heaven
[1:14:12] amen the blood has already purchased
[1:14:14] your ability to go into that body
[1:14:16] hallelujah i think they should just make
[1:14:18] all oh i've got a big complex don't
[1:14:20] worry about it
[1:14:21] little by little you'll take the land i
[1:14:23] was listening yeah i was reading the
[1:14:24] scripture the other day god told the
[1:14:26] children of israel i'll give it to you
[1:14:27] little by little
[1:14:29] i mean to you across jordan but there'll
[1:14:31] be a day too you'll take jericho
[1:14:33] and then day three you'll take this and
[1:14:34] day four you're gonna take this place
[1:14:36] and
[1:14:36] yeah little by little so you say i've
[1:14:38] got a lot of problems in my life don't
[1:14:39] worry
[1:14:40] little by little i never had a good dad
[1:14:44] you know i never had a good relationship
[1:14:46] with my father he hated me just just
[1:14:47] walking little by little
[1:14:49] you'll see god is a real father he loves
[1:14:51] you he cares for you he worries about
[1:14:52] you you're precious in the sight
[1:14:54] i never had a good relation with my mom
[1:14:56] little by little
[1:14:57] hallelujah i have never had any friends
[1:15:00] little by little complex i got this
[1:15:01] addiction i've tried to find
[1:15:03] a place to belong little by little
[1:15:05] you'll see where you belong
[1:15:06] i mean you don't belong in the world we
[1:15:08] don't belong in drugs or the pub or
[1:15:10] wherever where
[1:15:11] i used to be i found one day i belong in
[1:15:13] the word of god
[1:15:14] i mean that my identity is being a
[1:15:16] christian not because i have decided
[1:15:18] because god has declared it
[1:15:20] hallelujah amen so don't worry about
[1:15:23] complexes don't worry about giants
[1:15:26] caleb and joshua said they're just bred
[1:15:27] for us that was his report
[1:15:30] sure they're big sure they're
[1:15:32] intimidating sure they may have big
[1:15:33] cities and whatever but
[1:15:35] they just had their bread they're going
[1:15:37] to be our daily food
[1:15:38] what's your daily food what are you
[1:15:40] going to have for breakfast tomorrow i'm
[1:15:41] going to eat up my complex
[1:15:42] i'm going to eat up my problem i'm going
[1:15:45] to eat up my problems whatever
[1:15:46] personality things i'm going to eat it
[1:15:48] up what about lunch we're going to serve
[1:15:50] the same thing
[1:15:52] it may be dressed up a different way
[1:15:53] maybe roast this way baby cereal this
[1:15:55] day whatever but hey we're just going to
[1:15:57] eat it all up
[1:15:58] it's actually my you know it's amazing
[1:16:00] trials bring
[1:16:02] character trials bring strength
[1:16:05] if you didn't have any opposition how
[1:16:07] could you get strong
[1:16:08] i mean it's like a boxer in the ring you
[1:16:10] know when they're training they get
[1:16:12] someone exactly like their opponent
[1:16:15] hallelujah because they want to beat
[1:16:17] their opponent on the
[1:16:18] on that day because it's only those few
[1:16:20] rounds in the ring on the day matter
[1:16:23] hallelujah and they train against they
[1:16:25] they get someone who's
[1:16:26] exactly like their opponent and they
[1:16:28] begin to train
[1:16:29] but it makes them stronger maybe they're
[1:16:32] not very good with a left hook but their
[1:16:34] opponent is with the right or whatever
[1:16:35] and and so so they get blindsided all
[1:16:37] the time but eventually
[1:16:39] after the frustration leaves they'll see
[1:16:41] actually this is for my good
[1:16:43] this trial is actually strengthening me
[1:16:45] it's building character in me it's
[1:16:46] making me walk you know the devil
[1:16:48] studies
[1:16:49] watches you how you work with the word
[1:16:54] and he exploits that weakness so if
[1:16:56] you're real loose and don't even read
[1:16:58] your bible he'll exploit it
[1:17:00] if you're only looking through a certain
[1:17:01] way through the scripture he'll exploit
[1:17:03] that
[1:17:04] if you just have a very legalistic kind
[1:17:05] of way of looking at the scripture he'll
[1:17:06] exploit that
[1:17:07] he'll raise something up in your family
[1:17:09] it'll make you eat eat dirt basically
[1:17:11] eat your words you know he'll do that
[1:17:13] because he'll exploit that wing
[1:17:15] if you're very liberal you know with
[1:17:16] your walk then god looks i mean i mean
[1:17:18] the devil will exploit that too
[1:17:21] but it builds character challenge we
[1:17:23] need challenge
[1:17:25] we need trials therefore our good they
[1:17:27] are more precious to us than gold
[1:17:30] hallelujah and the price of gold has
[1:17:32] gone up recently
[1:17:34] so the price so the value we put on our
[1:17:36] trials we should put a greater value on
[1:17:38] them
[1:17:39] because god has allowed it because he
[1:17:40] wants to build a strength
[1:17:42] hallelujah for us to overcome the next
[1:17:45] challenge
[1:17:46] can you imagine the faith that was just
[1:17:48] built
[1:17:49] in the children of israel when they're
[1:17:52] about to cross jordan
[1:17:53] how we're going to cross this river it's
[1:17:55] springtime it's flooding time
[1:17:58] if god was really god he would have
[1:17:59] brought us here in the wintertime or
[1:18:01] or summertime when the river's real low
[1:18:04] but god brings us to places that seem
[1:18:05] impossible
[1:18:06] and they had no boats they weren't they
[1:18:08] weren't maritime kind of people
[1:18:10] i mean but so god is going to show you
[1:18:12] now this is not
[1:18:13] it's not going to be you crossing the
[1:18:14] river i'm going to make a way across the
[1:18:16] river
[1:18:17] and then so the so the levites they
[1:18:19] carried the ark which represented the
[1:18:21] word
[1:18:22] amen and they carried it and the waters
[1:18:24] parted and they crossed over on dry
[1:18:26] ground which shows me now
[1:18:27] if the word is carried over the heart of
[1:18:29] a levite over a minister
[1:18:31] i mean that word ministered will produce
[1:18:33] an a a way across
[1:18:36] something that is uncrossable why
[1:18:38] because faith cometh by hearing and
[1:18:39] hearing the word of god
[1:18:41] that's why it's very important don't sit
[1:18:43] there like a chair
[1:18:45] enter in this is for you and i it's for
[1:18:48] me
[1:18:48] you know i come to church i say lord
[1:18:50] speak to me but you're standing here now
[1:18:52] but lord you can still minister to me
[1:18:53] even if it comes out of here
[1:18:55] hallelujah and so so their faith would
[1:18:59] have increased saying well
[1:19:00] you know as as god was with moses so
[1:19:02] he's now with joshua
[1:19:03] and their faith would have raised
[1:19:05] because now they're crossed in an
[1:19:06] impossible way
[1:19:07] but now they've come to jericho they
[1:19:09] think how how on earth can we take it
[1:19:10] and joshua looks around he's trying to
[1:19:12] see any weak points in the wall or
[1:19:14] whatever he sees there's no way it can
[1:19:15] be done
[1:19:16] and he's looking there he's meditating
[1:19:17] on the lord in the morning and a man
[1:19:19] comes with a sword drawn
[1:19:21] and he chat and he draws his own sword
[1:19:22] saying you for us are against us because
[1:19:24] why
[1:19:24] because joshua's on a war footing are we
[1:19:27] on a war footing today
[1:19:28] amen but then but then that man says i'm
[1:19:30] not for you or against you
[1:19:31] but i've come as the captain of the host
[1:19:33] of the lord so now god had come down to
[1:19:35] take over
[1:19:36] the whole campaign so he says i'm not
[1:19:38] for you against you i've come to take
[1:19:39] over this whole battle
[1:19:40] and then they took jericho in a
[1:19:42] supernatural way
[1:19:44] how would have increased faith
[1:19:46] hallelujah because little by little
[1:19:48] you'll take the land but little by
[1:19:49] little your faith will raise to meet the
[1:19:51] challenge that's about to come
[1:19:53] hallelujah amen amen so
[1:19:57] trials are good for us you say yo
[1:20:00] we need adversity hallelujah
[1:20:07] amen now
[1:20:11] so god quickens us to who we are to his
[1:20:14] word
[1:20:16] he's not here to make alive our pastor
[1:20:18] our complexes all those things
[1:20:20] you keep walking with the lord he'll
[1:20:21] take care of everything he's very good
[1:20:23] at it
[1:20:24] if he can put this planet here with life
[1:20:27] on it
[1:20:28] in a perfect part of the galaxy to
[1:20:30] actually look at all the stars and
[1:20:31] everything
[1:20:32] and put life here and the seasons work
[1:20:34] you know
[1:20:35] if we're here next year we'll go through
[1:20:37] a different set of seasons and we'll
[1:20:38] still be here
[1:20:40] hallelujah he's very good yo nature the
[1:20:42] only problem with nature is when man
[1:20:44] interrupts it
[1:20:46] right so you know god is very good at
[1:20:47] his business
[1:20:49] you know they can they know when comets
[1:20:52] come back around
[1:20:52] it could be hundreds of years like
[1:20:54] hayley's comet different ones
[1:20:56] because god knows the orbit of that
[1:20:57] comet because he said it you're going to
[1:21:00] go that far a few hundred years around
[1:21:01] this way then you come back around
[1:21:04] hallelujah if god can set the stars in
[1:21:06] the in the heavens
[1:21:08] and they're all in motion they're not
[1:21:09] static they're all in motion
[1:21:11] and they all come back around at the
[1:21:13] same time can he not look after you and
[1:21:15] i
[1:21:17] hallelujah amen but you see
[1:21:20] we must have the word quicken that will
[1:21:22] make it live
[1:21:24] but you see now god must be the
[1:21:27] christian in us
[1:21:29] now if we go to the book of ezekiel and
[1:21:31] chapter 36
[1:21:33] we're just going to we're just going to
[1:21:34] read this here
[1:21:37] because remember this is what i've been
[1:21:39] talking about is the effects of saying
[1:21:41] tell me tell me it's not you won't
[1:21:45] don't tell me god it's actually tell me
[1:21:47] god become my head
[1:21:49] change my life mold me shape me into the
[1:21:52] image of your word
[1:21:53] not to the image of a church but the
[1:21:55] image of the word
[1:21:57] so in ezekiel 36 the lord has this
[1:22:00] promise here
[1:22:01] and and we're going from verse 24.
[1:22:08] he says for i'll take you from among the
[1:22:10] heathen
[1:22:11] and gather you out of all countries and
[1:22:13] bring you into your own land
[1:22:15] amen so there's going to be a gathering
[1:22:16] taken place we know this is not to a g
[1:22:19] geographical even though it talks about
[1:22:21] a natural country here but you know this
[1:22:22] is not talking about a geographical
[1:22:24] location for
[1:22:25] the christian right but that land that
[1:22:28] is ours is the word of god
[1:22:30] we have come back to the land of the
[1:22:31] word hallelujah it's flying with milk
[1:22:34] and honey
[1:22:35] hallelujah there's all good things in
[1:22:37] this land there's healing in this land
[1:22:39] there's peace in this land there's love
[1:22:41] in this land
[1:22:42] there's a statue of the perfect man in
[1:22:43] this land there's faith amen there's
[1:22:45] overcoming power there's healing there's
[1:22:46] a rapture in this land
[1:22:48] hallelujah they're speaking in tongues
[1:22:50] prophecy all the gifts of the spirit
[1:22:52] they're all in the land
[1:22:53] we've come to live on this land then
[1:22:56] i'll sprinkle clean water upon you
[1:22:59] and you shall be clean what are we
[1:23:01] washed by the water of the word
[1:23:03] amen you'll be clean from all your
[1:23:05] filthiness
[1:23:06] and from all your idols will i cleanse
[1:23:08] you
[1:23:09] hey i had a lot of idols i was an idol
[1:23:12] house
[1:23:13] hollywood idol sports idols drinking
[1:23:16] games
[1:23:16] everything idols education idols
[1:23:19] whatever
[1:23:20] they're all in here i had to be cleansed
[1:23:22] from them
[1:23:23] he said a new heart will i also will i
[1:23:26] give you
[1:23:27] and a new spirit will i put within you
[1:23:29] and i'll take away the stony heart out
[1:23:31] of your flesh and i will give you in
[1:23:33] heart of flesh
[1:23:34] so he has to change our hearts from a
[1:23:36] heart of stone to a heart of flesh
[1:23:38] to even accept that the word is true
[1:23:41] but we can't just stop there right we're
[1:23:44] going to go all the way in
[1:23:46] amen it wasn't just that they left egypt
[1:23:48] they had to go into the promised land
[1:23:50] hallelujah so so god has to change our
[1:23:53] stony hearts
[1:23:54] to a heart of flesh we'd even receive
[1:23:56] that the word is true
[1:23:58] he has to change our human spirit
[1:24:00] because many times
[1:24:02] we can't even live with ourselves
[1:24:06] maybe i'll just say i couldn't even live
[1:24:08] with myself
[1:24:09] so he had to change my spirit
[1:24:12] amen we get a new spirit we quit our
[1:24:14] drinking you know we quit our gambling
[1:24:16] we put our running around with women all
[1:24:18] different kind of things like that
[1:24:20] i mean and you had a new spirit he does
[1:24:22] that but now
[1:24:24] you know he says why we couldn't even
[1:24:25] live with yourself with the spirit you
[1:24:27] did have
[1:24:28] you couldn't live with your neighbor you
[1:24:29] couldn't associate with the next man on
[1:24:31] the next corner
[1:24:32] you couldn't associate with these
[1:24:34] christians why you would have had an
[1:24:36] or you had an awful spirit so he has to
[1:24:38] give you a new spirit
[1:24:39] i'll give you a new heart and you spirit
[1:24:41] now watch and i'll put my spirit in you
[1:24:43] there's the difference
[1:24:44] i'll put my spirit in you now this is
[1:24:46] the next verse and i'll put my spirit
[1:24:48] within you
[1:24:50] and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[1:24:52] you shall keep my judgments
[1:24:55] and do them so now it's not just coming
[1:24:57] up to a place and getting a new spirit
[1:24:59] so i've been set free from the world
[1:25:01] that's an incredible work of god
[1:25:03] now my heart is a heart of flesh i can
[1:25:05] actually receive the word as true
[1:25:07] that's an incredible work of god but
[1:25:09] don't just stay there
[1:25:10] you got to keep going until he puts his
[1:25:12] spirit within you
[1:25:15] and that will cause you to walk in his
[1:25:17] statutes which is his word
[1:25:19] so it's actually god comes in this is
[1:25:22] what happens when you say i will
[1:25:24] amen tell me god tell me to cause the
[1:25:27] surrender
[1:25:28] that god now comes in and he his spirit
[1:25:31] within us
[1:25:32] causes us to walk according to his word
[1:25:35] and and you shall keep my judgments and
[1:25:38] do them
[1:25:38] so it's not us trying to you know
[1:25:40] address you know
[1:25:42] little williams nine months old to try
[1:25:44] and dress him can be a mission
[1:25:46] you know he put him on the changing
[1:25:48] table he's already trying to turn over
[1:25:49] and get on his hands and feet and she
[1:25:51] got to pin him down like well you know
[1:25:52] and you know it can be a real mission
[1:25:54] and that's like us many times
[1:25:56] you know and you know if he gets a bit
[1:25:58] older he'll try and dress himself and
[1:25:59] that will be a mission too
[1:26:00] and many times that's us trying to be a
[1:26:02] christian we try and put the word on
[1:26:05] to make it fit us and we're wrestling
[1:26:07] and god's trying to you know he just
[1:26:08] says just just just give up
[1:26:11] just surrender your whole heart to me
[1:26:12] just give yourself to me that's what
[1:26:14] he's trying to do
[1:26:15] he's trying to dress us in the robe of
[1:26:16] his righteousness but we're wriggling
[1:26:18] and we're trying to do it ourselves and
[1:26:19] you know we just start crying get upset
[1:26:21] i can't live this and i failed again
[1:26:23] i've got this trouble and
[1:26:25] you know but there comes a time where
[1:26:27] you give up
[1:26:29] hallelujah you know sometimes i look at
[1:26:31] william i say we can do this the easy
[1:26:33] way
[1:26:33] oh the hard way and the hard ways for me
[1:26:36] you know
[1:26:37] sometimes it's the easy way but you know
[1:26:40] that's what but
[1:26:40] that's how it needs to be is when his
[1:26:42] spirit comes within us then he causes us
[1:26:45] to walk in a statute and to keep his
[1:26:46] judgments and do them
[1:26:49] hallelujah that's the result now of
[1:26:51] someone who says
[1:26:53] tell me amen brother braham says
[1:26:56] and why is it so hard why is it so that
[1:26:59] many christians find it hard to live a
[1:27:00] christian life
[1:27:02] he says now we got all kinds of
[1:27:04] everything for coming and we haven't got
[1:27:06] it
[1:27:06] till you get it but brother you haven't
[1:27:08] got it until there is the spirit of god
[1:27:10] comes from heaven and changes your life
[1:27:11] and makes
[1:27:12] the fruits of your life a different
[1:27:14] person by their fruit you shall know
[1:27:16] them that's the reason
[1:27:18] you have so much ups and downs you get a
[1:27:20] new spirit you quit your drinking
[1:27:21] you get a new spirit you quit your lying
[1:27:23] you get a new spirit you can do almost
[1:27:25] anything with that new spirit
[1:27:27] but that isn't what god's talking about
[1:27:29] a new spirit he said i'll give you now
[1:27:30] watch
[1:27:31] i'll give you a new heart and a new
[1:27:33] spirit why he'd have to give you a new
[1:27:35] spirit to live for him
[1:27:37] while you couldn't even live with
[1:27:38] yourself with the spirit you did have
[1:27:40] you couldn't live with your neighbor you
[1:27:42] couldn't associate with the man next
[1:27:44] door on the corner
[1:27:45] you can associate with these christians
[1:27:46] why you had an awful spirit
[1:27:48] so he has to give you a new spirit i'll
[1:27:50] give you a new heart and a new spirit
[1:27:52] now watch and i'll put my spirit in you
[1:27:54] that's the difference i put my spirit in
[1:27:57] you
[1:27:58] hallelujah amen so
[1:28:03] we're living in an hour
[1:28:06] where there's a people in the earth and
[1:28:08] i'm just going to kind of wrap this up
[1:28:10] short and sharp here we are
[1:28:13] i know we've got rapture chairs but you
[1:28:15] know we're not going to sit there till
[1:28:16] the rapture
[1:28:17] you know i trust you appreciate the news
[1:28:19] anyway you know
[1:28:20] we're living in an hour where god
[1:28:24] has put on flesh again in a people
[1:28:26] hallelujah
[1:28:27] it's gone from argument into reality
[1:28:30] amen where there is a people that are
[1:28:33] quickened by the holy ghost that the
[1:28:35] word lives in them again
[1:28:37] amen the holy ghost will always point to
[1:28:40] the word
[1:28:41] it will never point to creed of
[1:28:42] denomination amen always point to the
[1:28:44] word he died to confirm that word and
[1:28:47] make that word a positive
[1:28:49] he all he died so he could himself into
[1:28:52] that word he's the quickening life that
[1:28:53] makes the word live again
[1:28:55] that was his purpose of dying that he
[1:28:57] could still project himself
[1:28:59] through his church and make every word
[1:29:01] through every age act exactly the way
[1:29:03] it's supposed to act he is the dynamics
[1:29:06] of the mechanics the mechanics of the
[1:29:08] church what is it apostles prophets
[1:29:09] teachers evangelists pastors so forth
[1:29:11] here's the dynamics that works that and
[1:29:14] it's worked by
[1:29:14] dynamic power which is called it's like
[1:29:17] fire that fires off the gas like a spark
[1:29:18] plug making a spark
[1:29:20] here's the fire in that combustion
[1:29:22] chamber that when the word or the gas is
[1:29:24] poured over into that combustion chamber
[1:29:27] he's the one that sets her of fire he is
[1:29:29] the one that confirms it he is the power
[1:29:31] of the resurrection he is god
[1:29:32] he is the fire that's what he is
[1:29:36] hallelujah he is a consuming fire
[1:29:39] hallelujah now if he manifested
[1:29:42] the word because he was the word he
[1:29:45] didn't come just with a debate
[1:29:47] he said if you can't believe me believe
[1:29:49] the very works for they testify of me
[1:29:52] so if he came in that way and there was
[1:29:54] a supernatural vindication of who he was
[1:29:57] amen and if we are part of him right
[1:30:00] by the atonement atonement means at one
[1:30:02] minute he's made us one with him
[1:30:04] so now it's no longer us that lives but
[1:30:06] christ lives in us
[1:30:07] would then not we have that same
[1:30:09] manifestation of a spirit living through
[1:30:11] us
[1:30:13] amen amen we are living in that hour
[1:30:16] where i yeah maybe i'm just getting old
[1:30:19] but i just keep repeating myself you
[1:30:21] know
[1:30:22] but a people who say tell me lord have
[1:30:24] the manifestation of that towel
[1:30:27] right they actually have a life a
[1:30:29] testimony
[1:30:30] of proof that what god has told them it
[1:30:33] is living
[1:30:35] hallelujah moses
[1:30:38] met the pillar of fire there in the
[1:30:40] burning bush
[1:30:41] eighty-year-old man sticking his hand
[1:30:43] went down into egypt
[1:30:45] he said pharaoh let my people go
[1:30:48] god sent him down there and god went in
[1:30:50] him to do the job
[1:30:52] and the thing is he did it one man
[1:30:54] invasion took a people out of a nation
[1:30:57] hallelujah the apostle paul met that
[1:31:00] same god
[1:31:01] and wherever he went sure there's a lot
[1:31:03] of trouble you know there'll always be
[1:31:04] trouble where the truth is
[1:31:06] the devil loves to upset us right you
[1:31:09] know we get upset our families get upset
[1:31:11] tension comes in trouble
[1:31:12] we should just realize hey that's all
[1:31:14] part of the job that's all in the job
[1:31:16] description we should expect trouble
[1:31:19] hardly because the devil wants to upset
[1:31:21] us get us all tense and tight and
[1:31:22] stressed and worried
[1:31:23] that we take our eyes off god and onto
[1:31:26] natural things
[1:31:28] amen so so we should be very uh prepared
[1:31:31] for such things but
[1:31:33] he you know it's amazing the apostle
[1:31:35] paul chained to a roman soldier
[1:31:37] wrote most of the bible in a dungeon
[1:31:41] he received mighty revelations from god
[1:31:44] in a dungeon chained to a soldier or
[1:31:45] chained to a wall
[1:31:47] hallelujah he could walk with god
[1:31:48] chained to a dead man
[1:31:50] because the soldier wasn't made alive in
[1:31:52] christ and and we can have all kinds of
[1:31:54] excuses for reasons why we can't serve
[1:31:56] god the way we want to the apostle paul
[1:31:58] served to
[1:31:59] serve god the way he wanted to in spite
[1:32:01] of all the obstacles
[1:32:03] hallelujah god's holy ghost is here to
[1:32:05] help us cause us to overcome more things
[1:32:08] amen amen hallelujah
[1:32:12] now what about you and i you know the
[1:32:14] scripture
[1:32:16] god has to interpret the scripture to us
[1:32:19] what do you mean by that i was going to
[1:32:20] finish with this
[1:32:21] what i mean by that is it's not just
[1:32:22] making it make sense but make it live
[1:32:26] so when he said lay hands upon the sick
[1:32:28] and they shall recover
[1:32:29] lord interpret that to me and what
[1:32:31] happens he leads you to lay hands upon
[1:32:32] the sick and they get better
[1:32:34] you actually see the manifestation of it
[1:32:35] in my name thou shall cast out devils
[1:32:38] lord what does that mean he anoints you
[1:32:39] and you cast out a devil
[1:32:41] right you see a devil leave someone
[1:32:43] their lives are changed
[1:32:45] hallelujah speaking new tongues lord
[1:32:46] you've got to interpret that to me what
[1:32:48] is he doing anointing you speaking in
[1:32:49] your tongue
[1:32:50] he causes the word to be make it he
[1:32:52] brings it to pass in your life
[1:32:54] that what i mean by him interpreting it
[1:32:56] now
[1:32:57] you know all the revelations we've
[1:32:59] received they need to be interpreted to
[1:33:01] us
[1:33:01] they need to be made alive so it goes
[1:33:04] from just a
[1:33:05] theory to a reality
[1:33:08] hallelujah you know brother branham was
[1:33:11] there
[1:33:13] and he was hunting squirrels and he was
[1:33:16] meditating on the scripture
[1:33:17] if ye say to this mountain be thou
[1:33:19] removed cast to the sea it shall move
[1:33:21] you don't down your heart it shall move
[1:33:23] and it's wondering what is that really
[1:33:24] you know how does it really work and the
[1:33:26] lord came down he asked him what are you
[1:33:28] looking for squirrels
[1:33:30] well he's you've been asking about that
[1:33:31] scripture you just speak the word
[1:33:33] he said well let us scroll up here on
[1:33:35] this and he shot it he says visions
[1:33:37] don't bleed and they ate the squirrel
[1:33:40] and they said well the you know how
[1:33:41] about and then and then the lord said
[1:33:43] well how many do you want he said well
[1:33:44] three or five i can't remember
[1:33:45] he said well uh let it appear in this
[1:33:48] tree where squirrels aren't a squirrel a
[1:33:49] pet he shot it he ate it
[1:33:51] so god came down and interpreted that
[1:33:54] scripture to him
[1:33:55] it shouldn't be the same thing with you
[1:33:57] and i lord come and make the word alive
[1:33:59] to us
[1:34:02] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:34:05] but you see now the antichrist spirit
[1:34:08] wants to come into the church make it
[1:34:10] formal
[1:34:11] cold and powerless but the holy ghost is
[1:34:14] present to make the church
[1:34:15] on fire alive and full of power
[1:34:19] amen not formal and powerless but alive
[1:34:22] and the holy ghost quickened by his
[1:34:23] spirit
[1:34:24] amen but the thing is now as my title is
[1:34:27] tell me
[1:34:29] who's doing the telling will be
[1:34:31] manifested in your life
[1:34:33] so if a spirit is telling you you're
[1:34:36] worthless
[1:34:37] and you'll never make it and you're not
[1:34:39] important and no one loves you
[1:34:41] what what do you see in a life someone's
[1:34:43] depressed withdrawn
[1:34:44] and depressed right because they're
[1:34:47] listening to a spirit
[1:34:48] the thing doing the telling comes and
[1:34:50] lives in them
[1:34:51] that is not the voice of god we're
[1:34:54] important to god
[1:34:55] we're the apple of his eye one soul is
[1:34:57] worth more than ten thousand worlds
[1:34:58] if he went to calvary just for you he
[1:35:00] would have done it well just for once
[1:35:02] he would have gone hallelujah so now
[1:35:05] it's the one
[1:35:06] that we're listening to will be
[1:35:08] manifested in you and i
[1:35:10] hallelujah now that's why it's very
[1:35:12] important forgive me if i feel like i'm
[1:35:14] going into another subject but i'll
[1:35:15] close with this statement
[1:35:16] that's why during the book of revelation
[1:35:19] it says
[1:35:19] listen to him the heaven ear let him
[1:35:22] hear what the spirit says to the church
[1:35:24] that voice is the word of god to the
[1:35:25] church now we must have a spiritual ear
[1:35:27] to hear what the
[1:35:28] spirit says and we've got to speak that
[1:35:30] same word forth
[1:35:31] that means that at that if god says
[1:35:34] you're more than a conqueror
[1:35:36] we're more than a conqueror if we're
[1:35:38] overcomers
[1:35:39] if our faith has overcome the world amen
[1:35:41] that that is the sow
[1:35:43] if we are accepted in the beloved in
[1:35:45] jesus christ then we are
[1:35:47] that's what the spirit tells us that's
[1:35:49] what we're going to speak forth
[1:35:50] amen if the devil will be under our feet
[1:35:52] devil get under my feet in jesus
[1:35:54] christ's name
[1:35:55] if there is power in the blood to
[1:35:56] overcome all temptations troubles trials
[1:35:59] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:36:01] hallelujah let it be unto me according
[1:36:03] to the word lord
[1:36:05] hallelujah this is how we're living it
[1:36:07] never ever can have a negative
[1:36:08] confession

[1:36:12] of jesus christ

[2:12:47] just as musicians keep playing i was
[2:12:49] just thinking
[2:12:50] this morning as brother ben was
[2:12:52] preaching you know we've either got fear
[2:12:54] and doubt or faith fear or faith
[2:12:58] are the two options that we've got and
[2:13:02] when the spies went and searched out the
[2:13:04] land they came back with a report and
[2:13:06] those that had
[2:13:07] fear and doubt heard the report a
[2:13:10] certain way
[2:13:11] based on their fear and their doubt they
[2:13:13] said wow were there big giants there
[2:13:15] yeah they were big giants well were
[2:13:18] there fortified cities
[2:13:19] yes there were fortified cities did they
[2:13:22] look big and strong
[2:13:24] yes they looked big and strong they and
[2:13:26] they were being fearful based on
[2:13:28] what these giants could do to them what
[2:13:31] the people in the land could do to them
[2:13:32] like
[2:13:33] are there thousands and thousands in
[2:13:34] these fortified cities yes there are
[2:13:36] thousands and thousands in there and
[2:13:37] they were
[2:13:38] becoming more fearful as they were being
[2:13:39] told this report based on fear
[2:13:42] but think about it this way when caleb
[2:13:45] and joshua heard the report their report
[2:13:46] was based on faith right
[2:13:49] amen so they saying so that
[2:13:52] caleb and joshua would ask also there
[2:13:53] were giants there really there were
[2:13:55] giants
[2:13:56] so they were really big yeah they were
[2:13:58] really big it's good
[2:14:00] but they look real strong yeah they look
[2:14:02] real strong
[2:14:03] did they have big fortified cities yeah
[2:14:05] they had big cities and they're getting
[2:14:07] more and more excited
[2:14:10] did they look quite hard-working people
[2:14:12] yeah they did
[2:14:13] this is gonna be good if they're big and
[2:14:15] strong means you've got to eat heaps
[2:14:17] their vineyards would be nice and big
[2:14:20] they're
[2:14:20] they're they want to be like if they're
[2:14:22] fit and strong and and
[2:14:24] work hard they would have built all
[2:14:25] sorts of machinery to till the fields
[2:14:27] you mean we walk into big fortified
[2:14:30] cities do they have watch towers
[2:14:31] everywhere yeah they have watchtowers
[2:14:32] that's so good we don't need to build
[2:14:33] them ourselves
[2:14:34] you know they probably had water coming
[2:14:36] through the city it's all irrigated for
[2:14:38] us
[2:14:39] imagine if you had to come into a land
[2:14:40] with lazy
[2:14:42] people that don't do nothing they run
[2:14:44] away when you see them what's the land
[2:14:46] going to look like they'll be run down
[2:14:48] nothing near these they would have
[2:14:49] turned up and had to do all this work
[2:14:50] because
[2:14:51] the place was run down these giants
[2:14:53] worked hard man their metabolism was
[2:14:55] going so fast at it
[2:14:56] it was a lamb flying with milk and honey
[2:14:58] because they had to eat a lot of food
[2:14:59] man they're working hard
[2:15:00] and all the vineyards and that depends
[2:15:03] how you look at it they were so excited
[2:15:04] they're like let's go man this is all
[2:15:05] laid out before us
[2:15:06] we just gonna chase a couple of giants
[2:15:08] away but aside from that there's no
[2:15:09] problem
[2:15:10] it all depends on how you look at it and
[2:15:11] everything that we go through
[2:15:13] there's a blessing in all of it amen
[2:15:16] amen
[2:15:17] praise the lord let's um let's just sing
