[14:47] [Music]
[15:00] um
[15:25] drippy thing when you put a mask on
[15:27] um
[15:28] welcome down to forest lakes i get the
[15:29] job of the really boring mundane stuff
[15:32] to do without the safety
[15:36] thank you um so
[15:38] we've got the simple things like one
[15:40] person on the trampoline at a time um
[15:44] just simply because there's no warranty
[15:46] on it once you go over 100 kilos on
[15:48] there so it's just as easy to say one at
[15:49] a time and they have got a smaller one
[15:51] um
[15:52] so these types of people reading
[15:54] themselves the thai swing is four people
[15:56] at a time
[15:58] if you need to evacuate down on the
[16:00] field down there there are numbers one
[16:03] to eight
[16:04] one to twenty two sorry for the cabins
[16:19] to get you marked off to know who's here
[16:22] if we're here to evacuate for a fire
[16:24] and around the top of the roundhouse
[16:26] they're above the office where those
[16:27] cabins are that balcony around the front
[16:30] is only a fire escape
[16:32] so kids if we see you out there we'll
[16:34] think the building is burning down okay
[16:36] so you don't need to be out there unless
[16:39] the building is burning um it hasn't
[16:40] happened yet in 50 years so hopefully it
[16:43] won't happen this weekend
[16:45] um
[16:46] so those those are pretty main date
[16:48] after swimming pool
[16:50] if you're using the pool there needs to
[16:52] be adult supervisors there they need to
[16:54] be over
[16:55] 16
[16:56] and once you get over eight people in
[16:58] the pool then you need to have at least
[17:00] two supervisors
[17:02] um
[17:03] what else is the boring things i forgot
[17:04] about don't go swimming in the lake it's
[17:06] really dark and if you drown it'll be
[17:09] really hard to find you okay so only
[17:11] swimming in the pool
[17:12] and are you using the mudslide then
[17:15] no so we won't worry about that one
[17:17] um the other thing is that noise travels
[17:20] around here we've got quite a few
[17:21] neighbours so outside our noise curfew
[17:24] is 10 o'clock at night
[17:25] the other really good housekeeping thing
[17:28] for you to be aware of is that our
[17:30] mosquitoes are just starting to come out
[17:33] so if you leave your door open and your
[17:36] windows open and your lights on at night
[17:39] you may come back to your room that's
[17:40] got some extra visitors and mosquitoes
[17:42] aren't that great for helping you sleep
[17:44] so
[17:44] at night make sure
[17:46] that if your light is on your doors and
[17:49] windows are shut
[17:50] and
[17:52] the rest of us pretty much just have a
[17:54] great weekend
[17:55] and if you've got any questions i'll be
[17:57] pretty much in the office most of the
[17:59] time you're here
[18:00] and
[18:01] otherwise there are quite a few people
[18:03] here that know how to contact us
[18:19] [Music]
[18:24] good evening
[18:26] praise the lord hallelujah
[18:29] amen

[19:05] there it is here
[19:11] um so as liz was saying they have a
[19:13] noise curfew

[19:31] sanctuary as long as we can you know
[19:33] don't go wandering off and
[19:36] also
[19:37] you know we're here to have fellowship
[19:39] with each other
[19:40] so don't go wandering off into bush
[19:42] walks at night becoming one with nature

[20:24] you know we don't have any rules about
[20:26] cell phones but you know i recommend
[20:27] let's make the most of
[20:29] spending time with each other
[20:31] because this might be the last camp we
[20:32] ever have
[20:33] if it is and we're going to rapture
[20:34] praise the lord but you know you know
[20:37] there's so this world is changing yeah
[20:40] and so make the most of spending time
[20:42] with each other
[20:45] is that
[20:47] yes and i believe
[20:49] that's all where all i've got
[20:51] but
[20:52] i believe we're in for a special time in
[20:55] the presence of our lord jesus christ
[20:57] uh we have brother alpha preaching
[20:59] tonight which i believe we're gonna have
[21:00] a real treat with brother adrian in the
[21:01] morning
[21:02] and um i believe you know
[21:05] the lord is gonna do something
[21:07] you know we we get what we expect
[21:10] and brother abraham says in the message
[21:12] straight as the gate
[21:14] he would say this he says the other day
[21:16] leo and i was sitting on the street and
[21:18] some of us talking
[21:20] and i kept feeling there was a change
[21:22] coming a change coming
[21:24] when we spoke of it it wouldn't be a
[21:26] change in my ministry
[21:27] because it can't be no more but it'll be
[21:30] a change in me
[21:32] i've always been a weakling and just let
[21:34] people lead and guide me and send me
[21:35] this way and that way
[21:37] if i'd done something the lord told me
[21:39] to do a long time ago i wouldn't be in
[21:41] the trouble i'm in today and he says i'm
[21:43] going out the next week to be alone with
[21:45] god to pray and you know he says i don't
[21:47] want to be a weakling i want to stand on
[21:48] my convictions so he says there won't be
[21:50] a change in the ministry and i could say
[21:52] especially for the bride and the end
[21:53] time the word is open
[21:55] you know the fullness of the word the
[21:57] fullness of christ has been unveiled in
[21:59] this day so there's no more i mean
[22:02] christ is fully unveiled so it's got to
[22:03] be a change in us like elisha he had to
[22:06] be changed to fit elijah's mantle
[22:08] right so it's got to be us you know the
[22:10] word is here christ is here the book is
[22:12] open but you know i took this quote when
[22:15] i heard it i just want to apply it to
[22:17] myself i want there to be a change in me
[22:19] because the word don't need changing
[22:21] amen but the enemies are changing me
[22:23] that the word can put on flesh and a
[22:25] greater measure in my life that's what i
[22:26] want i want more of him to live so
[22:29] let's um let's stand
[22:31] uh this evening
[22:33] and let's commit our lives to the lord
[22:35] who'd like a touch from god this this
[22:37] camp

[25:26] out of the way not that brother ben was
[25:27] formality but
[25:28] you know mary and martha were
[25:30] busy one day well martha was very busy
[25:32] one day dealing with all sorts of
[25:34] natural things
[25:35] but
[25:37] mary just sat at the feet of jesus to
[25:39] hear what he had to say
[25:40] and
[25:43] and the lord said to martha when she
[25:45] questioned why are you letting mary
[25:47] should be helping me and he said one
[25:49] thing is needful

[26:10] is going to meet us in the most powerful
[26:11] way that he ever has in our whole lives
[26:14] up to this point we're going to get a
[26:16] touch from almighty god on this during
[26:18] this camp service i'm expecting that i'm
[26:20] expecting a mighty outpouring of the
[26:21] holy ghost tonight and this whole camp
[26:23] meeting
[26:24] it's going to be like nothing you've
[26:26] ever

[1:32:59] that's what i was saying brother at the
[1:33:01] end of these meetings there will be
[1:33:03] something that would have happened
[1:33:06] if you can't see somebody being raised
[1:33:08] from the dead but i know there's a soul
[1:33:11] that's dead that's going to be risen up

[1:34:06] beyond the long dresses
[1:34:09] beyond the long dress the long hair and
[1:34:11] stuff beyond the ties that we put to
[1:34:13] owner so that this is still a fresh
[1:34:16] young man
[1:34:18] there is still a big job to be done
