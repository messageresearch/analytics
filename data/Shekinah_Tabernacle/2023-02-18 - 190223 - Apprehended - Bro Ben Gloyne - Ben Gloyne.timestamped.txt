[45:03] God bless you all
[45:04] really appreciate it so much amen so
[45:07] let's um let's turn to the scripture
[45:08] this morning we're going to go to
[45:10] um we're going to go to
[45:12] uh Revelation no sorry we're gonna go to
[45:14] Hebrews 11 we're going to read one
[45:16] scripture here um
[45:17] Hebrews 11 and 13.
[45:29] to Hebrews 11 and 13 just just one
[45:33] one
[45:34] um
[45:37] now maybe let's just start from verse
[45:39] eight actually uh Hebrews 11 and 8 will
[45:41] read down to verse 13 here or verse 14
[45:43] rather so by faith Abraham when he was
[45:46] called to go out into a place that he
[45:48] should after receive for an inheritance
[45:49] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[45:51] whether he went by faith he so um
[45:53] sojourned in a Land Of Promise in the
[45:55] land of promise as in a strange country
[45:57] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[45:59] Jacob the ears uh with him of the same
[46:02] promise for he looked for a city which
[46:04] hath foundations whose Builder and maker
[46:06] as God through faith also Sarah herself
[46:09] receives strength to conceive seed and
[46:10] was delivered of a child when she was
[46:12] past age because she judged him faithful
[46:14] who had promised therefore sprang there
[46:17] even of one and him as good as dead so
[46:20] many as the stars of the sky in
[46:24] multitude and as the sand which is by
[46:26] the seashore innumerable these all died
[46:28] in faith not having received the
[46:30] promises but having seen them afar off
[46:33] and were persuaded of them embrace them
[46:36] and confess that they were Rangers and
[46:38] pilgrims on the earth for they that say
[46:40] such things declare plainly that they
[46:44] seek a country amen you may have your
[46:46] seats this morning may the Lord bless
[46:48] you also just one quick sorry
[46:50] um so that door that we used to take out
[46:52] uh to go out to the foyer please don't
[46:55] use that after service just take the
[46:56] back door and then eventually we'll get
[46:58] the front door I mean the back door
[46:59] sorted out that'll become the front door
[47:00] but just leave this door here for during
[47:02] service just go out by the sound disc
[47:04] that'd be really good amen so God bless
[47:06] you and Lord bless his word so I want to
[47:08] talk about here just this
[47:10] just the thought about being apprehended
[47:12] by the promises of God where it's so
[47:14] amazing when you look into hear this
[47:16] Hebrews 11 how we just read how you know
[47:18] they saw the promises are far off so
[47:20] those promises weren't close to them but
[47:22] they saw them afarf and they were
[47:24] persuaded of them they were influenced
[47:26] by them and they embraced them now it
[47:28] seems to be a strange thing to embrace
[47:30] something that's far away how can you
[47:31] lay hold of something that's actually in
[47:33] the distance but Faith takes you brings
[47:35] that promise into the present though the
[47:37] Fulfillment may be for even for a future
[47:39] generation like like like like them you
[47:42] know that promised land that Abraham
[47:44] walked upon you know it wasn't it was
[47:45] given to him but it was given to really
[47:47] his children and it was you know 400
[47:49] years later you know after Abraham Isaac
[47:51] and Jacob then it was 400 years of of of
[47:54] of the children of Abraham being in
[47:56] being in Egypt then they actually came
[47:57] out finally and possessed a land so so
[48:00] the promise wasn't actually to Abraham
[48:01] it was to his children but though he but
[48:04] but he saw the promise of far off and
[48:06] and and it persuaded him you know it
[48:08] actually talked him into it you know it
[48:10] actually convinced us how it actually
[48:12] made his mind thinking a little bit you
[48:14] know differently that actually you know
[48:16] you know you changed his way of thinking
[48:18] it actually you know persuaded him in
[48:20] such a way amen that that that it would
[48:23] actually cause him to actually yield or
[48:25] obey it I made some promises of God we
[48:28] know are more than just nice things to
[48:29] put on Instagram we'll put on the fridge
[48:31] but actually the promises of God are God
[48:33] himself because God in his word you
[48:35] cannot divide your Gardener's word are
[48:37] not two separate things they are the
[48:38] same person just like the Centurion wood
[48:41] would um come to come to Jesus and he'd
[48:43] say my my servant is grievously uh sick
[48:46] you know very very unwell and Jesus said
[48:49] well I'll go pray for them and he said
[48:51] no I'm not worthy that you come under my
[48:52] roof you know I'm I'm a man of authority
[48:55] you know I call people to come here and
[48:56] do this and they come and they obey he
[48:58] said just speak the word only and and my
[49:00] servant shall be made whole so so that
[49:03] Centurion that Gentile had a revelation
[49:05] that God and His word were the same
[49:07] person and by Jesus saying that he's
[49:10] made well was exactly the same as Jesus
[49:12] physically walking through his front
[49:14] door going to the bedroom wherever the
[49:16] servant was laying his hands upon Him
[49:17] praying for him and he got well him
[49:20] speaking the promise was exactly the
[49:22] same as he himself walking into that
[49:24] room and healing him as the same thing
[49:26] with the promises of God today we have
[49:28] to believe amen that his promises are
[49:30] the same as him and him speaking the
[49:32] promise is the same as him coming and
[49:34] fulfilling the promise just like Jesus
[49:36] going and healing the Centurion amen so
[49:38] we're going to realize that we're not
[49:39] far from God you know some people get
[49:41] the idea in their mind the devil puts it
[49:43] in their mind you're far away from God
[49:44] we are not far away from God you see
[49:47] because Faith confesses what God has
[49:49] done for us amen see see unbelief so
[49:52] unbelief is is confessing what the devil
[49:54] says faith is confessing what God has
[49:56] done what he says amen so the Bible
[49:59] tells us that we were once far off I'll
[50:01] just try and find it in my notes here
[50:03] um well let's just go to Ephesians
[50:05] chapter two I know it's there amen um
[50:08] uh we're gonna go to Ephesians chapter 2
[50:10] and then the latter part of that uh
[50:11] let's but let's just read this together
[50:13] because if we could really look into the
[50:15] scripture and say what does it say about
[50:17] you and I and it's irrespective of
[50:19] condition how you're feeling how your
[50:21] week's going how your family is your
[50:23] bank account whatever variable you want
[50:25] to put as an excuse It's irrespective of
[50:28] those things I mean what God has done if
[50:30] we start confessing what God has already
[50:32] done for us not what he will do but what
[50:34] he has done amen then then it'll give us
[50:37] a real Victory you know I was thinking
[50:39] you know we've got a better room to
[50:40] dance in this church now hello you know
[50:43] when we're building this thing we can
[50:44] dance in this place now we have room
[50:45] Hallelujah I mean to fully Express how
[50:48] we feel on the inside Amen to express
[50:50] really What the Lord Has Done For Us
[50:52] amen praise God so Hallelujah let's keep
[50:55] amen here we are so so second um so
[50:58] Ephesians chapter 2 will start from
[50:59] verse 14. now make this personal make it
[51:02] make it personal because because Paul's
[51:03] writing to you he's not writing just to
[51:06] the Ephesians he's writing to you amen
[51:08] because every every scripture is is
[51:10] personal
[51:12] right amen well some aren't because some
[51:15] are Promises to the devil don't take
[51:16] those ones take the ones that are for
[51:18] you right amen for he is our peace he's
[51:20] my peace
[51:21] amen who have made both one and hath
[51:24] broken down the middle wall of partition
[51:25] between us so he's taken down the wall I
[51:28] mean there are some walls broken down in
[51:30] this place where we had to walk around
[51:31] the long way you couldn't see what was
[51:33] on the other side but those walls just
[51:34] got busted down I'll lose the same thing
[51:36] with God by his blood he's busted down
[51:38] the wall of sin amen I press I'm glad
[51:41] our God is in the demolition business
[51:43] Hallelujah he just takes his D9
[51:46] bulldozer and just goes to your Tin Can
[51:48] Alley of sin bulldozes it down puts up a
[51:50] great a great you know Mansion of his
[51:52] glory and it's on Hallelujah Highway and
[51:54] you're just rejoicing in the presence of
[51:56] God hallelujah amen having abolished in
[51:58] his flesh the enmity even the law of
[52:01] Commandments contained in ordinances for
[52:03] to making himself of Twain one new man
[52:06] so making peace
[52:08] he's a peacemaker uh that he might
[52:10] reconcile both unto God uh in in one
[52:13] body both the cross having I mean sorry
[52:15] in one body by the cross having slam the
[52:18] enmity thereby and come and preach peace
[52:20] to you which were far off and to them
[52:22] that deny for through whom we have both
[52:24] one access by one Spirit unto God the
[52:27] Father I mean if he's not far away he's
[52:29] not far away yeah let's just say the
[52:31] Lord's close
[52:33] the Lord's here his spirit's here right
[52:35] now he's not far away somewhere amen his
[52:39] his cell phone towers don't get
[52:41] overloaded with with calls right the
[52:44] line's always open he's not far from you
[52:46] amen he's closer than your next breath
[52:49] Hallelujah he's head of a fellow's word
[52:51] but you've got to believe he's here to
[52:52] fulfill his word for you amen remember
[52:54] his promises remember we don't serve a
[52:56] god of History we don't have a his you
[52:58] know this is not a historian place if
[53:00] you've come to learn history you've come
[53:01] to the wrong building Victoria
[53:03] University is maybe that way somewhere
[53:05] and there's a history Department you can
[53:06] go there if you want to learn history
[53:07] but we're here to see that God is alive
[53:10] today he's The Great I Am amen he's not
[53:12] the I was he is the I am I mean he's
[53:15] here to fulfill his word but we've got
[53:17] to see now if they were persuaded by
[53:19] promises that were afar off and they
[53:21] embrace them but the promise wasn't for
[53:23] them was for their children now how much
[53:25] more you and I who are at the end of all
[53:27] the ages where all the promises that God
[53:29] are in fulfillment right now amen we're
[53:31] not standing it would have been amazing
[53:33] to stand there and be with the Apostle
[53:34] Paul he'll begin to speak of future
[53:36] events of the Rapture cycle and you know
[53:38] we shall not all sleep and we shall be
[53:40] changed into you know come under the
[53:42] influence of that word as it was
[53:43] released to the earth and the excitement
[53:45] that it would have generated but you
[53:46] know that was for two thousand years
[53:48] down the road I mean you know we know
[53:50] that the dead in Christ they'll rise
[53:51] first they actually have a greater a
[53:53] greater part than us would travel alive
[53:56] and Reign right but the thing is now
[53:58] those promises were for this day they
[54:01] weren't just for that day because they
[54:03] weren't alive and remain they had to die
[54:04] you know in the faith waiting for us to
[54:07] come to our position in the end time
[54:08] amen so you know but you think about the
[54:11] excitement when Paul would write that to
[54:12] the Thessalonians and no doubt the
[54:14] excitement were building you know they'd
[54:16] have a jubilee uh they'd have a praise
[54:17] break and begin to Rejoice because
[54:19] thinking this is us that he's talking
[54:21] about but you know God withheld from the
[54:23] church it actually be 2 000 years when
[54:25] finally that scripture would come into
[54:27] fulfillment and now here we are so the
[54:29] promise isn't afar off and it's been
[54:32] embraced now the promises here and we
[54:34] embrace it amen we're actually actually
[54:36] the promises here who's with me you
[54:37] understand what I'm saying the promise
[54:39] is not years down the road it is right
[54:41] now
[54:42] I mean you think about the the the
[54:44] incredible season that we're alive
[54:47] because I believe every True Believer
[54:49] that's actually had a taste of the other
[54:51] land where God has has met them in some
[54:54] form you know touched their hearts
[54:55] changed their lives it throws them into
[54:57] expectation that they're going to step
[54:59] into heaven one day they're under
[55:01] expectation the Lord is going to come
[55:02] and take them away amen there's a
[55:04] Heavenly land that they're going to you
[55:06] know I'm so thankful the heaven that we
[55:08] talk about is not just an idea it's not
[55:11] just an ethical moral kind of nice kind
[55:13] of place it's a real place it's not man
[55:15] devised ideas but Heaven is a real place
[55:18] just like this is a real place there's a
[55:20] really a land beyond the river amen and
[55:22] that's sweet forever that only by faith
[55:24] will get there by faith to cream amen
[55:26] but I believe that there is a heaven
[55:28] we're going to and I believe if we
[55:31] really focus on where we're going uh I
[55:33] think it'll change our Earthly walk we
[55:35] won't become like a bunch of useless
[55:37] monks that only just uh staring into the
[55:39] you know infinite but will actually be
[55:41] more a blessing upon the Earth if we
[55:44] focus on where we're going
[55:46] I mean because the more we focus on
[55:48] where we're going the more that land
[55:49] will influence us and we know Heaven
[55:51] consists of the word of God anymore the
[55:53] word will will will influence us and
[55:55] then we'll be a better blessing to our
[55:57] families to our communities to our
[55:58] schools to our jobs wherever we are upon
[56:00] the Earth will be a greater blessing to
[56:02] everyone
[56:03] amen because they said that they were
[56:05] and they confessed so when they saw the
[56:07] promise of far off they confessed that
[56:09] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[56:11] Earth
[56:11] Hallelujah so so when the promises of
[56:14] God are revealed when God reveals
[56:16] himself this is it it throws us into
[56:18] this condition
[56:19] that we confess we're just passing
[56:21] through this is not our ending this is
[56:23] not our destination this is just a stop
[56:26] like you catch the train it says next
[56:27] stop this station next stop this station
[56:29] but finally you come to the place where
[56:31] you get off amen we don't get off here
[56:32] we can get off here hallelujah sure you
[56:35] get more excited as you get closer to
[56:37] the different train stations you're more
[56:38] alert you're gonna be asleep when you
[56:40] get on but when you hear you know the
[56:41] next Stop's melling or next stops
[56:43] wherever you begin to wake up because
[56:44] you don't realize I've got to get off
[56:45] here I've got to get off this train you
[56:47] know it's the same thing we've we've
[56:49] come through seven seven stations
[56:52] you know if it's a Simona pergamist
[56:54] satire or Philadelphia ladio Syria now
[56:56] we're here in the bright age rights who
[56:58] have come through seven stops now we're
[57:00] in the Rapture age Hallelujah so now
[57:02] we're beginning to perk up we're here we
[57:04] have arrived Hallelujah you may be in
[57:06] asleep as the scenery went past but
[57:08] you're here amen I believe the law the
[57:10] chief conductor saying the next stop is
[57:12] Glory Hallelujah I trust you're excited
[57:15] for that one that's a real good one
[57:16] that's the best stop Hallelujah and
[57:19] that's where we're going so I trust that
[57:21] I trust when the law gets a hold of your
[57:23] life it's throwing you into this
[57:24] condition where you confess you're just
[57:25] a stranger and Pilgrim on the Earth
[57:28] we're just passing through
[57:30] Hallelujah this is the season where all
[57:32] the prayers of the Saints will be
[57:33] answered
[57:35] as it would say in Revelations 5 you can
[57:37] turn with me there if you want to
[57:38] Revelations 5 and verse 5 to 10 where
[57:41] where this is the scene where John is is
[57:43] caught up we know that the first
[57:46] um so
[57:47] at the end of Revelations chapter 3
[57:49] which is the end of our church age God
[57:51] describing the season we're in I mean it
[57:53] says then I Heard a Voice in heaven in
[57:55] that same voice that spoke to me was
[57:56] there in the open door and is lifted up
[57:58] into the eternal and so now John sees
[58:01] the um sees the throne room of God
[58:03] Revelations four and five then there
[58:04] comes a season now when when the lamb
[58:07] himself comes and takes the book where
[58:09] he takes everything that Adam lost now
[58:11] and he takes it back into his hands
[58:12] because as a man lost it in the garden
[58:14] so a man had to redeem it back so our
[58:17] great Creator became Our Savior amen God
[58:19] became man to redeem us back to himself
[58:21] because no man could pay the price in
[58:23] their own self we're all born and sin
[58:25] we're all born lost we're all born in
[58:26] prison we can't get out ourselves no
[58:28] matter how good we think we are we can't
[58:30] escape amen but that's why someone had
[58:32] to come from the other side of the fence
[58:34] Hallelujah and he and he didn't burrow
[58:36] under the fence he busted through the
[58:37] fence he said this is a jailbreak amen
[58:40] doesn't matter how many guards the devil
[58:42] tried to put in his way unbelief doesn't
[58:43] stop our God all the scribes and the
[58:46] Pharisees the herodians all the
[58:47] political nonsense going on that day it
[58:49] didn't stop God he busted through the
[58:51] fence purchased our Salvation said
[58:53] children run through this way amen
[58:55] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[58:57] Christ remission of sin and you shall
[58:58] receive the gift of the Holy goes what's
[59:00] that that's your jailbreak Hallelujah
[59:03] hey man it's just um and so one of the
[59:05] elders saith under me weep not Behold
[59:07] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[59:09] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[59:11] in the loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[59:13] I beheld and low in the midst of the
[59:15] throne in the and and of the four beasts
[59:17] in the midst the Elder stood a lamb it
[59:18] had been slammed now we know this is all
[59:20] symbolic right and there's all the book
[59:22] of symbols having seven horns and seven
[59:24] uh seven horns and seven eyes which are
[59:26] the seven spirits of God sent forth into
[59:28] all the Earth and he came and took the
[59:30] book out of the right hand of him that
[59:31] sat upon the throne and when he had
[59:33] taken the book The Four beasts and Four
[59:35] and Twenty Elders fell down before the
[59:37] lamb every one of them uh and every one
[59:39] of them Harps and golden vials full of
[59:41] odors which are the prayer of prayers of
[59:44] saints so these prayers have been
[59:46] contained down Through the Ages they've
[59:48] been lifted up before God even we read
[59:50] in uh Genesis chapter five you're the
[59:53] genealogy of Adam that says that their
[59:55] man began to call upon the name of the
[59:57] Lord because Adam no doubt would have
[59:58] Adam and Eve would have relayed what I
[1:00:00] was like to be in in the garden to be in
[1:00:02] perfection no sin
[1:00:05] no trouble
[1:00:06] no sickness no bad days no pulled
[1:00:10] muscles no soreness
[1:00:12] you know it's amazing this is you think
[1:00:14] how incredible the fall was
[1:00:16] the first thing that made Adam ever fear
[1:00:18] was hearing the voice of God after the
[1:00:21] fall you know fear you know any any
[1:00:23] emotion that comes through our body is a
[1:00:25] chemical reaction different different
[1:00:27] chemicals are released that makes us
[1:00:29] feel love or or or or
[1:00:32] um or the pre you know sadness or fear
[1:00:34] whatever it is as different chemicals
[1:00:36] are released and the first time he ever
[1:00:38] felt fear was when God came down the
[1:00:41] call of the evening to her fellowship
[1:00:42] with them this is after the fall they
[1:00:44] hid themselves because I heard the voice
[1:00:45] of God walking in the garden that's the
[1:00:48] first do you think about before the fall
[1:00:50] they just would have had I believe just
[1:00:52] a joy Here Comes father we've had such a
[1:00:55] great day in this paradise that he made
[1:00:57] us and now we get to spend more time
[1:00:59] with him Hallelujah but then there came
[1:01:01] a time because of the fall when they
[1:01:02] heard that same voice speaking and they
[1:01:05] got afraid
[1:01:06] they were actually in fear we you know
[1:01:09] to me it's incredible thing how people
[1:01:11] at Fallen man is afraid of the voice of
[1:01:13] God man is actually afraid of the
[1:01:15] supernatural of God even when the
[1:01:17] disciples were out on the water they
[1:01:19] were rowing because the wind was
[1:01:20] contrary basically the wind was coming
[1:01:21] head onto them they were wrong trying to
[1:01:23] get somewhere and Jesus came walking the
[1:01:25] Fourth Watch of the night which is just
[1:01:27] before Dawn so just before Dawn Jesus
[1:01:29] comes walking on the water they've been
[1:01:31] rowing all night and they get afraid of
[1:01:33] the very one that's come to save them
[1:01:35] they're afraid of him because they
[1:01:37] misunderstand who he really is he says
[1:01:40] be of a good cheer it's I and then the
[1:01:42] fear left and when they realized who it
[1:01:43] was it's the same thing with you and I
[1:01:45] we should not be afraid of God we should
[1:01:48] not hide away put up a wall lift up the
[1:01:51] drawbridge you know in our hearts we
[1:01:53] should always be open say Lord you're
[1:01:55] here not to destroy us but to redeem us
[1:01:57] your head affects me here to change me
[1:01:59] you hit it stabilize my life and you're
[1:02:01] here to give me peace in my heart you
[1:02:03] know that's is that how you feel when
[1:02:05] you think about the law that he yeah
[1:02:06] he's come to do good things he hasn't
[1:02:08] come to do bad things to us amen he
[1:02:10] loves us he's our loving father
[1:02:12] Hallelujah so so these these golden
[1:02:15] vials full of Voters which are the
[1:02:17] prayers of saints these prayers could
[1:02:19] not be answered till this day when the
[1:02:21] lamb would take the book because there
[1:02:23] was an expectation there's a prayer Lord
[1:02:25] when are you going to come Lord come
[1:02:26] quickly Lord but it was locked into a
[1:02:28] Time season because guiding you on his
[1:02:31] calendar when he was going to take the
[1:02:32] book when he's going to release the
[1:02:33] revelation of it to the seventh angel
[1:02:35] and it's going to be given to us we will
[1:02:37] come with it one with it we prophesy
[1:02:39] again that was this season that it would
[1:02:41] happen so these prayers that have been
[1:02:43] prayed all the way down through the ages
[1:02:45] of the Rapture and the translation of
[1:02:47] the Saints and walking on streets of
[1:02:48] gold they were all held until this
[1:02:51] season that's why they saw the promise
[1:02:53] it was afar off right they are persuaded
[1:02:56] of it but now the promise is not far off
[1:02:58] it's right now
[1:02:59] amen so every every answer that has been
[1:03:02] waiting for an answer is here now that's
[1:03:04] why I say we've made room for protocols
[1:03:06] we're going to get more chairs you know
[1:03:08] the more people are going to come and
[1:03:10] meet the Lord and you know God's going
[1:03:11] to move in a greater way there's going
[1:03:13] to be the power of God I believe we're
[1:03:14] literally going to dance around this
[1:03:15] church and God's going to move in this
[1:03:17] place maybe not today maybe next service
[1:03:19] I don't know why not now though and
[1:03:21] we'll dance around this place amen and
[1:03:23] change will fall off Liberty Bells will
[1:03:26] ring the Holy Ghost will fall uh that's
[1:03:28] what I'm I'm expecting and I'm believing
[1:03:30] Hallelujah that we could have a Sunday
[1:03:32] night at camp and a Sunday morning you
[1:03:34] know at church Hallelujah
[1:03:37] because our God can do anything
[1:03:39] amen but you feel the move of the spirit
[1:03:41] just move with him Hallelujah you say no
[1:03:44] one's dancing with me he's actually
[1:03:45] invited you to dance amen so you know
[1:03:48] but I believe we're in the season where
[1:03:49] every prayer is going to be answered
[1:03:51] I believe it's now not in the future one
[1:03:54] day no no no you know it's like but yo
[1:03:57] yo Believers are in such a way it's very
[1:03:58] easy to believe for the future but what
[1:04:00] about the now you know Martha would
[1:04:02] would you know your Martha Mary that
[1:04:04] Barry Lazarus and you know Jesus was
[1:04:05] four days late we know he's in the Tomb
[1:04:07] four days and uh you know Jesus came at
[1:04:11] his appointed time and it wasn't Mary
[1:04:13] that ran out to meet him it was Martha
[1:04:15] and so you know Jesus would speak to her
[1:04:18] and you know uh Martha would say you
[1:04:20] know I know my brother will raise him
[1:04:22] the last day I know he will I have an
[1:04:24] assurance basically Martha's saying to
[1:04:27] the Lord you know Lazarus was a Believer
[1:04:29] I knew he's a Believer he's going to
[1:04:31] rise he is a real Christian but then
[1:04:33] Jesus said to her but I am the
[1:04:35] resurrection and the life so so he's
[1:04:37] trying to get hurt not to just look at
[1:04:39] the last day look at today
[1:04:42] so it's not I will be the resurrection
[1:04:44] of the life no I am I am the
[1:04:46] resurrection of life either believeth me
[1:04:48] though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:04:50] and who whosoever liveth and believeth
[1:04:52] in me shall never die believeth thou
[1:04:54] thus she said unto him yea Lord I
[1:04:56] believe Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:04:57] God which has come into the world Martha
[1:05:00] believed but her faith was for an event
[1:05:01] in the future but the Lord brought her
[1:05:04] faith into the present and I believe
[1:05:06] that's what the Lord wants us to do that
[1:05:07] not just to look into the future for the
[1:05:09] promises of God to be fulfilled but to
[1:05:11] bring them into the now because I am
[1:05:13] right now the Resurrection the life he
[1:05:15] is I am the one who keeps my word I am
[1:05:18] the one that fulfills my word I am the
[1:05:19] one who's here to fulfill which I have
[1:05:21] promised unto thee amen you may think
[1:05:23] it's tarried for a long time but I
[1:05:24] believe this is the season amen where
[1:05:27] every Divine promise that God will be
[1:05:28] fulfilled
[1:05:30] Hallelujah
[1:05:32] amen this is this is the hour I mean so
[1:05:34] we can we can Rejoice amen because we're
[1:05:37] not here
[1:05:39] looking afar off
[1:05:40] the promises are here
[1:05:42] that's exciting don't you think it's
[1:05:44] exciting Hallelujah
[1:05:46] amen praise the Lord now
[1:05:49] if we look into if we go to
[1:05:52] um Philippians
[1:05:54] and Philippians chapter 3 because I want
[1:05:56] to talk about now everyone oh let's just
[1:05:57] read this and we'll go into this a bit
[1:05:58] here so
[1:05:59] um Philippians 3 and verse
[1:06:02] um
[1:06:03] verse 12 to 16.
[1:06:07] because the Apostle Paul you know I I
[1:06:10] Marvel at his life
[1:06:12] and what he did and how the things he
[1:06:14] had to overcome and just his walk with
[1:06:16] God
[1:06:18] it's amazing how the Lord said I'm going
[1:06:20] to make him an example
[1:06:22] to the world
[1:06:23] and
[1:06:26] so Philippians 3 and verse 12 do we do
[1:06:28] we have that or no but it's fine so it
[1:06:29] says here and not as though I had
[1:06:31] already obtained neither already perfect
[1:06:34] but I follow after if that I may
[1:06:36] apprehend that which is which also I'm
[1:06:39] apprehended of Christ Jesus so the
[1:06:42] Apostle Paul is saying I haven't made it
[1:06:44] he knew he had eternal life okay so so
[1:06:46] when he's talking about perfection he's
[1:06:48] not saying well I need to be sinlessly
[1:06:50] perfect I'm getting there he's not
[1:06:52] talking about that being being perfect
[1:06:54] in the scripture has has two meanings
[1:06:57] depends what it's being talked about one
[1:06:59] is a sinless Perfection by the blood of
[1:07:01] Jesus Christ whoever made sinlessly
[1:07:03] perfect so who's perfect today
[1:07:05] by his blood right but but the another
[1:07:09] meaning for perfect it means a full
[1:07:11] maturity
[1:07:12] so who's fully mature in the Lord
[1:07:16] someone's quick off the trigger but they
[1:07:18] kind of put the safety back on right
[1:07:20] there you see you see we are growing
[1:07:21] right we are maturing we're becoming
[1:07:23] more like him every day as we look into
[1:07:25] his word we hear the message we pray we
[1:07:27] become more like him all the time and we
[1:07:30] should never think we have made it
[1:07:33] we know we've made it when these bodies
[1:07:35] have changed that's what we know we have
[1:07:36] arrived but until we get to that point
[1:07:38] we are still growing we're still
[1:07:39] pressing the mark of the High Calling
[1:07:41] we're still dying out saying Lord make
[1:07:43] me more like you take all my Humanity
[1:07:45] away there wouldn't be me living but you
[1:07:47] living in me Lord amen so this is what
[1:07:49] the Apostle Paul was saying here he says
[1:07:51] that uh it's not as though I have
[1:07:52] already attained so so I'm not ready yet
[1:07:55] I'm not fully mature I'm growing now
[1:07:57] when we think of maturity we're going to
[1:07:59] look at through through God's eyes
[1:08:02] because whatever he thinks is maturity
[1:08:04] is maturity but we'll all get there and
[1:08:07] then the body change will happen but
[1:08:09] don't beat yourself up if you're his
[1:08:10] workmanship you're going to get there if
[1:08:13] you're your own workmanship well you
[1:08:15] better just be born again and meet God
[1:08:17] and let him change you right because
[1:08:18] it's not us trying to fix ourselves or
[1:08:21] us being the Christian he must become
[1:08:22] the Christian in our lives amen then he
[1:08:25] grows and you know he becomes like us so
[1:08:27] so let's just let the Lord take us that
[1:08:29] we can uh become perfect in a in a sense
[1:08:33] of a full maturity as well as a sinless
[1:08:35] Perfection I mean which is blood has
[1:08:37] already done for us but the Apostle Paul
[1:08:39] said that I wanna he says I want to
[1:08:40] apprehend that which I am also
[1:08:43] apprehended of Christ Jesus it says
[1:08:45] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:08:47] apprehended but this one thing I do now
[1:08:49] let's just stop in the middle of that
[1:08:50] scripture you think about the Apostle
[1:08:52] Paul he had the greatest revelation of
[1:08:54] the age being the prophet messenger for
[1:08:56] the Ephesian Church age you know he was
[1:08:58] caught up into the third heaven he was
[1:09:00] taken beyond the curtain of time you
[1:09:01] know he saw
[1:09:03] he would he would go meet the original
[1:09:05] Apostles and and he says they didn't add
[1:09:07] anything to what I believe he said that
[1:09:09] in the scripture he had the he had the
[1:09:11] revelation of the age but he's saying
[1:09:13] now I'm still I don't count myself to
[1:09:16] have apprehended so he was so he wanted
[1:09:18] to so the Lord on the road to Damascus
[1:09:20] apprehended him by the pillar of fire
[1:09:22] there got a hold of his life he was
[1:09:25] never the same from that moment on so
[1:09:27] the Lord got a hold of his life before
[1:09:28] that he is apprehended by being a
[1:09:30] Pharisee his own ambition was had had
[1:09:33] apprehended him and it's amazing you
[1:09:36] know we're all apprehended by something
[1:09:38] now the word apprehend it means like if
[1:09:40] you arrest someone for a crime you've
[1:09:41] been apprehended you're in cuffs you're
[1:09:43] a prisoner you've been you know you
[1:09:44] don't have your own will doesn't control
[1:09:47] what you do anymore you've been you've
[1:09:48] been taken prisoner and so the Apostle
[1:09:50] Paul before he came to the Lord he was
[1:09:53] apprehended by being a Pharisee of the
[1:09:55] Pharisees it's amazing how the devil
[1:09:57] will take our own human Fallen ambition
[1:09:59] and then drive that to to to make us be
[1:10:03] something we think is great you know you
[1:10:05] know we even look at this age so in the
[1:10:07] negative sense I want to go through
[1:10:08] negative apprehension first
[1:10:10] you know being apprehended a negative
[1:10:12] sense programs comes to the positives
[1:10:13] because the Apostle Paul was you could
[1:10:15] say he was apprehended in a very
[1:10:17] negative way he was apprehended by being
[1:10:19] a Pharisee by that religious spirit in
[1:10:21] such a way he even persecuted Christians
[1:10:24] the very reason he was going to Damascus
[1:10:26] is because he wanted to lock up
[1:10:27] Believers and he thought he's trying to
[1:10:29] he thought he's doing God a service but
[1:10:31] he was actually fighting as a very God
[1:10:33] he thought he was believing him
[1:10:35] and so he was apprehended and he was a
[1:10:37] Pharisee of the Pharisees is trying to
[1:10:38] make himself great within the
[1:10:40] organization and this age is such an age
[1:10:43] of self
[1:10:45] you know we can be people can be
[1:10:47] apprehended by by their own ego
[1:10:49] you know this age is such an age of self
[1:10:52] self-improvement self-help selfies it's
[1:10:55] all the me generation you know it's the
[1:10:57] i i everything I life you know it's all
[1:11:00] about yourself this is this is the age
[1:11:02] of self people want to uh apprehended by
[1:11:05] their own ego or their own looks or what
[1:11:07] they think they are and you know the
[1:11:09] whole reason that social media
[1:11:11] influences are so powerfully influential
[1:11:14] in this day is because they project
[1:11:16] themselves
[1:11:18] and they cause those who follow them to
[1:11:20] enter into parasocial relationships now
[1:11:24] a parasocial relationship Mr Google told
[1:11:26] me is is they are one-sided
[1:11:28] relationships which one person extends
[1:11:31] the emotional energy the interest and
[1:11:33] the time
[1:11:35] and the other party the Persona is
[1:11:37] completely unaware of the other's
[1:11:39] existence
[1:11:40] so it's not the influencer that that
[1:11:43] extends their emotional energy their
[1:11:45] interest in their time it's those who
[1:11:47] are watching all their you know on
[1:11:49] Instagram and their photos and their
[1:11:51] videos on YouTube different things
[1:11:52] caught up in what they're doing they're
[1:11:54] the ones who extend their emotional
[1:11:55] energy but what's going to happen when
[1:11:57] you pour your emotional energy into
[1:11:59] something that can't actually
[1:12:00] reciprocate it back
[1:12:02] this is why this world has had such a
[1:12:04] mental health problem and in my opinion
[1:12:06] people are investing into relationships
[1:12:08] that cannot actually give it back in
[1:12:10] kind and they become empty and they
[1:12:12] become depressed what's happening it's
[1:12:15] it's people are caught up apprehended by
[1:12:17] that influencer and their life and what
[1:12:19] they do and the person always makes a
[1:12:21] video like they're interested in the
[1:12:23] viewer and they don't know you from a
[1:12:25] hill of beans
[1:12:26] you can be living next door no probably
[1:12:28] not if they're in a multi-million
[1:12:29] mansion in California somewhere but if
[1:12:31] they were Joe everyone blogging you
[1:12:32] could be living right next to them they
[1:12:34] wouldn't know you
[1:12:35] I'm sorry they wouldn't say I'm so glad
[1:12:37] you liked my video no if they do respond
[1:12:39] they've got a team of people in the
[1:12:41] background responding for them
[1:12:42] but people you know invest all their
[1:12:45] emotional energy and interest and time
[1:12:47] and it's and and it's just like pouring
[1:12:49] yourself into a black hole
[1:12:51] it doesn't it doesn't actually give you
[1:12:53] any benefit it just consumes you
[1:12:56] what's happened people become
[1:12:58] apprehended
[1:12:59] they can dress like their influencer
[1:13:01] talk like them act like them even go to
[1:13:03] the same places as them
[1:13:05] but yet it's just an empty relationship
[1:13:08] our lord Jesus is not a social media
[1:13:10] influencer
[1:13:11] he invested his time
[1:13:13] his emotional energy his love his
[1:13:16] concern his care down Through the Ages
[1:13:19] he's always cared for his children he's
[1:13:21] he's had a burden for this Earth
[1:13:23] he's not indifferent to what's going on
[1:13:25] in the world he's not indifferent to
[1:13:27] what's going on in your life he cares
[1:13:29] about what's going on in your life it
[1:13:31] may be it may be such a small thing he
[1:13:33] cares about it he's interested in it
[1:13:35] Hallelujah I'm so glad we serve a God
[1:13:37] Like That
[1:13:39] amen that we can you know we can we can
[1:13:41] come to a God who actually cares about
[1:13:43] us no if people get caught up in their
[1:13:46] own ego they're apprehended by
[1:13:47] themselves we don't want to be
[1:13:49] apprehended by ourselves we're going to
[1:13:51] be apprehended by the word of God Amen
[1:13:53] that he would lead us so when the Holy
[1:13:55] Ghost comes brother Ram says it it takes
[1:13:57] wanting to be a big shot out of you
[1:13:59] it'll take it out of you it'll humble
[1:14:01] you when you do that that's why the Holy
[1:14:03] Ghost is for it's for a holy life that's
[1:14:04] what makes you quick gossiping makes you
[1:14:06] quit playing cards you know drinking
[1:14:08] smoking doing other things all around
[1:14:09] the corner see it but it takes that big
[1:14:11] shot ego desire out of your life when
[1:14:14] that comes you don't want to be the big
[1:14:16] one you want him to be the big one you
[1:14:18] want him to be the center of the life
[1:14:19] you want to be him to be the center of
[1:14:21] attention where people may you don't
[1:14:23] care if you're a member you want him to
[1:14:24] be known amen hallelujah
[1:14:27] so the Apostle Paul so that's all in the
[1:14:30] negative and you could go and list
[1:14:31] people are apprehended by their job by
[1:14:33] their Hobbies by their you know even
[1:14:35] their family by their houses by their by
[1:14:38] their material things people are
[1:14:39] apprehended by those things but that's
[1:14:42] all in the negative let's not focus on
[1:14:43] the negative let's look at the positive
[1:14:44] right amen so the Apostle Paul was he
[1:14:47] says I want to apprehend that which has
[1:14:48] apprehended me so the Lord got a hold of
[1:14:51] him but he wanted to reach back and get
[1:14:52] a hold of the one that got a hold of him
[1:14:54] so he now spent his whole life trying to
[1:14:56] apprehend the same God that apprehended
[1:14:59] him amen and and that being the focus of
[1:15:02] his life he he he got a what brother
[1:15:06] Bank calls a christ-centered life so the
[1:15:09] word was the center of his life the Lord
[1:15:11] was everything to him because his main
[1:15:14] focus was I want to get a hold of this
[1:15:15] one this great God that I thought I knew
[1:15:18] when I was a Pharisee this God that I
[1:15:20] thought I knew when I started him out
[1:15:21] was standing give lectures and people
[1:15:23] would applaud me and clapped me on the
[1:15:24] back and great Pharisee teachers say
[1:15:27] Well done the Apostle well that's all he
[1:15:29] did so good there and I've never seen
[1:15:31] that before you know he thought he knew
[1:15:34] him but he didn't know him at all and
[1:15:35] then God would would get a hold of him
[1:15:37] on the road to Damascus and he had such
[1:15:38] a desire I want to get a hold of this
[1:15:40] Lord I want to know you more Lord I want
[1:15:42] to I want to know the depths of your
[1:15:44] heart I want to know what's on your mind
[1:15:45] I want to know what you how you feel and
[1:15:47] I'm going to know what you think about
[1:15:49] us and what you think of me and you know
[1:15:51] he had such that long and do you have
[1:15:52] that kind of a longing amen Lord I want
[1:15:55] to know you more I don't just want to
[1:15:56] memorize scripture and quotes I want to
[1:15:58] I want to Anchor into my heart I want to
[1:16:00] know you I want to walk with you I want
[1:16:01] to experience you I want to understand
[1:16:03] the heart of your word not just the
[1:16:05] letter of it but your heart that's in
[1:16:06] your word and what you're trying to tell
[1:16:08] me Lauren Hallelujah he would be
[1:16:10] apprehended and yet he would come to a
[1:16:12] place where he says nothing moves me
[1:16:14] shipwrecks didn't move him he was
[1:16:16] apprehended remember the the biggest
[1:16:18] influence in your life is what has
[1:16:19] apprehended you
[1:16:21] see we're all sitting here saying well
[1:16:22] we're all Christians and praise the Lord
[1:16:23] but but really the main thing in your
[1:16:26] life is what has apprehended you see
[1:16:28] there see there's a lot of things that
[1:16:29] tried to apprehend the Apostle Paul he
[1:16:31] had to run from Damascus being lowered
[1:16:33] over the wall with a basket run for his
[1:16:35] life that that trauma could have
[1:16:36] apprehended him but it didn't apprehend
[1:16:38] him he was thrown into prison that could
[1:16:40] have apprehended him it didn't apprehend
[1:16:42] him here's Earth Paul and Silas and the
[1:16:44] inner present now that could have
[1:16:45] because he could have got to a point I'm
[1:16:46] just not going to preach anymore I'm
[1:16:48] just not going to put myself In Harm's
[1:16:50] Way anymore if God is God and he's so
[1:16:52] great why do I have to go through these
[1:16:54] things no he was apprehended by the word
[1:16:56] amen so so the so prison didn't
[1:16:59] apprehend him Stripes to apprehend him
[1:17:01] shipwrecks didn't apprehend him when
[1:17:03] when when he survived that shipwreck
[1:17:05] well God told him what would happen you
[1:17:07] know the ship was lost all the people
[1:17:08] are saved and you know he goes up on the
[1:17:10] bank he's collecting firewood and and
[1:17:12] that and that snake bit him in the hand
[1:17:14] that didn't apprehend him he shook it
[1:17:16] off because he said no what's
[1:17:17] apprehended me is the Angel of the Lord
[1:17:19] has told me I have to go to Rome hey man
[1:17:21] I have to go preach in Rome and we've
[1:17:23] got to realize we've been apprehended by
[1:17:25] a promise amen we're going in a Rapture
[1:17:28] Hallelujah so he just shook it off amen
[1:17:30] that thing that bit him I mean just like
[1:17:32] a malice or a bad experience or gospel
[1:17:35] pain just shake it off in the fire Shake
[1:17:37] It Off in the fire of God's word don't
[1:17:39] don't let it bite you and let the poison
[1:17:40] go through and flood your mind with
[1:17:42] negative thinking and this one does this
[1:17:43] and this trouble another Shake It Off in
[1:17:46] the fire and watch it burn up
[1:17:49] Hallelujah because he knew he had to go
[1:17:51] to Rome amen shipwrecks Stripes betrayal
[1:17:55] trouble in the church he says he fought
[1:17:56] the beast at Ephesus he wasn't fighting
[1:17:58] lions tigers and bears oh mine right no
[1:18:01] that was demon Spirits religious Spirits
[1:18:03] within the church those things didn't
[1:18:05] apprehend to me that they did not derail
[1:18:07] his walk he says I have kept the faith I
[1:18:10] have you know I afford a good fight I've
[1:18:12] kept the faith why because it's because
[1:18:14] for me there's a crown
[1:18:16] and and that Crown of Life I mean is for
[1:18:19] all those not only me but all those that
[1:18:20] love his glorious appearing why because
[1:18:23] he is so apprehended he realized life is
[1:18:26] more than this life is more than God
[1:18:28] coming down I even say this life is even
[1:18:30] more than God coming down now I hope
[1:18:33] this comes out right and and blessing us
[1:18:34] in church
[1:18:36] Heaven is more real than this you know
[1:18:39] science if you look at the wavelength
[1:18:41] wavelength right visible light's a very
[1:18:43] small part of the spectrum
[1:18:45] we can only see a small part of the
[1:18:47] created world
[1:18:48] even this telescope the James Webb
[1:18:51] Telescope that was built it's an
[1:18:52] infrared telescope it can see far beyond
[1:18:54] the Hubble telescope so it looks in in a
[1:18:57] in a wavelength we can't even see and
[1:19:00] and it's actually shown there's more of
[1:19:01] the universe that man has ever seen
[1:19:03] before it's all it's been there the
[1:19:05] whole time but they've only just
[1:19:06] developed the technology to build the
[1:19:08] thing and set it into the space and put
[1:19:10] it out there that they can see what
[1:19:11] they've been seeing you know they're
[1:19:13] they're they're they're way behind
[1:19:15] behind schedule I mean we're about a
[1:19:17] profit come in the state and look from
[1:19:19] eternity to Eternity and that same same
[1:19:22] anointing on the prophet has come unto
[1:19:24] you and you can see that I come from God
[1:19:26] and I'm going back to God I'm just in
[1:19:28] this hickey of time but when time is no
[1:19:31] more I shall still be Hallelujah so we
[1:19:33] can see far beyond what man can see
[1:19:35] Hallelujah but it just goes to show this
[1:19:37] far more to the world that man can see
[1:19:40] with the natural eyes people say well
[1:19:42] when I see it I'll believe it no
[1:19:44] saying is not believing I mean believing
[1:19:47] as Revelation believing is actually
[1:19:49] taking it in faith before you feel it
[1:19:51] you see it you taste it you smell it you
[1:19:53] think it whatever you you choose to
[1:19:55] accept the word by faith before what the
[1:19:58] five senses declare him hey man so if
[1:20:01] you're not well today you're going
[1:20:02] through trouble choose to take the word
[1:20:04] above how you're feeling choose the word
[1:20:06] above your conscious and you're raising
[1:20:08] your imagination take the word above all
[1:20:10] those things amen then it can actually
[1:20:12] come it can come your eyes listening to
[1:20:14] brother Bradham uh yesterday and you're
[1:20:16] saying about how people will will just
[1:20:19] you know he gets thousands of letters
[1:20:21] after a meeting and people just just in
[1:20:23] the congregation maybe they are blind or
[1:20:25] in a wheelchair whatever more and they
[1:20:27] heard what was being preached he says I
[1:20:28] just can't pray for everyone and and you
[1:20:31] say you know I can hear your people hear
[1:20:34] the word and then like a week later
[1:20:35] they'll be they'll be thinking on what
[1:20:37] they heard in the service and they'll
[1:20:39] just get out of the wheelchair other
[1:20:40] eyes will come open God will
[1:20:42] supernaturally touch them why because
[1:20:44] the word came into their hearts but then
[1:20:45] they began to think about the promise
[1:20:47] and then God always comes to his word
[1:20:49] but you want God to come into your life
[1:20:51] think on the word receive the word into
[1:20:54] your life and God will come and Quicken
[1:20:56] that word
[1:20:57] you take the opposite the scrubs and
[1:20:59] Pharisees see see the same word that was
[1:21:01] spoken to the woman at the well
[1:21:03] spoken to them the same word that was
[1:21:06] spoken to the man who was born blind
[1:21:07] with no eyeballs was spoken to them
[1:21:10] right but they did not think on the
[1:21:12] Promises in a positive way they just
[1:21:14] took it and said he's Beelzebub versus a
[1:21:17] cult have nothing to do with this guy
[1:21:19] this is wrong he didn't come according
[1:21:21] to our schools if he is really the
[1:21:22] Messiah he'd come to Caiaphas as the
[1:21:24] high priest and you know this is wrong
[1:21:25] and blah blah blah blah didn't do them
[1:21:27] any good no
[1:21:28] no but unbelief did not hinder God but
[1:21:31] those who thought on the promise those
[1:21:33] who begin to think about it amen God
[1:21:35] came and confirmed the word
[1:21:38] praise the Lord and you know we are we
[1:21:40] are built exactly the same way that's
[1:21:42] why it's so important to think on the
[1:21:44] Promises of God I probably say at every
[1:21:45] service but maybe I'll just keep
[1:21:46] repeating it think on the Promises of
[1:21:49] God whatsoever things are good and true
[1:21:51] and honest and of a good report and have
[1:21:54] virtue think on those things I mean do
[1:21:56] not think on negative things negative
[1:21:58] thinking has helped no one
[1:22:00] positive thinking has helped everyone
[1:22:03] even in even in the great sporting Arena
[1:22:05] you know when coaches great coaches can
[1:22:08] get their team to believe that they are
[1:22:09] champions
[1:22:10] amen if a Coach has ever you know made a
[1:22:13] successful team they have actually put
[1:22:15] put it in the hearts of the team you can
[1:22:18] win you can do this you're not in this
[1:22:21] tournament just to participate you're
[1:22:22] here to pick the trophy up and that and
[1:22:25] they instill that in their team and they
[1:22:27] may be the worst team on paper but
[1:22:28] there's something in them that will rise
[1:22:29] and they will win that tournament why
[1:22:31] because they they they have faith in
[1:22:34] what they're being told now that's just
[1:22:35] in the sporting Arena how much more the
[1:22:37] children of God how much more you and I
[1:22:39] this morning amen where the word has
[1:22:41] said you are made in my image I've
[1:22:43] washed you in my blood I mean you're
[1:22:45] more than conquerors through him that
[1:22:46] loved you amen the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:22:48] your Advocate he's working on your
[1:22:50] behalf his promise is a true this is not
[1:22:52] Pie in the Sky ideas it's reality but
[1:22:55] don't let your mind wander come back to
[1:22:56] where I am
[1:22:57] hello everyone are we here amen
[1:23:00] think on good things
[1:23:03] don't think on negative things
[1:23:05] you think on his word the Lord will come
[1:23:06] and confirm the word in your life
[1:23:08] Hallelujah
[1:23:10] now so the Apostle Paul was apprehended
[1:23:12] by eternity
[1:23:14] and that's what made him live the life
[1:23:16] he lived he was apprehended
[1:23:19] he had a lot of trauma in his life he
[1:23:21] had a lot of hardship but after he met
[1:23:23] he had a way higher life after he became
[1:23:25] a Christian than before
[1:23:27] you know maybe the hardest thing he had
[1:23:29] in his life before was was stressing
[1:23:31] swatting for exams and what he's going
[1:23:33] to say when he gives a lecture
[1:23:35] but then sloth was turned upside down
[1:23:38] but God ordained it that way because God
[1:23:40] was using him as a pattern because
[1:23:42] there's a portion of suffering allotted
[1:23:44] to the church
[1:23:45] I'm glad there's no I said Hallelujah
[1:23:47] because no one wants those guy thinks
[1:23:48] but remember we would know him in the
[1:23:50] resurrection and the likeness office
[1:23:51] suffering so Christianity is actually
[1:23:54] more of a rugged life but we've got to
[1:23:56] realize we're not Christians just for
[1:23:58] the fun of it there's more to it than
[1:24:00] just what what meets the eye oh you just
[1:24:02] have a church you're a Christian there's
[1:24:04] there's more than that amen if you've
[1:24:06] really met God you know there's a lamb
[1:24:08] beyond the river you're going to amen
[1:24:10] you've been apprehended by eternity
[1:24:13] Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at
[1:24:15] people have been apprehended out of
[1:24:17] their own free will
[1:24:19] they haven't been tricked into it they
[1:24:21] haven't been uh whatever into it beaten
[1:24:24] into it you know there used to be back
[1:24:26] in the day back in the um you know the
[1:24:29] uh British Navy days where they had
[1:24:31] cannons and sailboats and things like
[1:24:33] that they had press gangs we're going to
[1:24:35] taverns and ports and things and they'll
[1:24:37] basically find drunk men hit them on the
[1:24:39] head and those men would wake up on the
[1:24:41] ship they're now in the Navy
[1:24:43] they had press gangs this is not how
[1:24:46] this works this is not a press ganging
[1:24:48] place you don't get hit on the head by
[1:24:50] the Bible and you wake up and you well I
[1:24:52] have to be a Christian no that's not how
[1:24:53] this works we sign up at our own free
[1:24:55] moral will
[1:24:57] no one forced me to be a believer
[1:24:59] Hallelujah I chose because I saw how
[1:25:01] great he is and what he's done for me
[1:25:03] hallelujah it's out of love and
[1:25:05] thankfulness we are believers amen
[1:25:06] because he's done so much for us
[1:25:10] Hallelujah
[1:25:12] Amen brother Brown would tell a story he
[1:25:14] would he would he would relate it in a
[1:25:15] few different ways where he'd speak um
[1:25:17] speak about how there was a there's a
[1:25:19] young young lady or um there and she was
[1:25:22] in Italy and she was she was there to
[1:25:24] learn how to do fine art and she was
[1:25:26] there for a couple of years and there
[1:25:27] was a caretaker that would be looking
[1:25:29] after the dorms in the school of where
[1:25:31] she was and you know um he would he
[1:25:33] would notice that that she did not hang
[1:25:35] out with the rest of the Americans who
[1:25:36] came because they just came and they've
[1:25:38] been University students they just
[1:25:40] painted up large but but she didn't do
[1:25:42] that kind of thing and she'd always look
[1:25:43] a certain time of night she'd look and
[1:25:45] go look out at the Moon and um or look
[1:25:48] at the Sun and you know and and so this
[1:25:50] caretaker said you know I want to ask
[1:25:51] you a question
[1:25:53] you know you know you know if you don't
[1:25:55] mind and and and
[1:25:56] um she would say yeah sure you could ask
[1:25:58] me and and he said you know why is it
[1:26:00] you don't hang out with the rest of the
[1:26:01] students that you came with from America
[1:26:03] why don't you drink up and why don't you
[1:26:04] party and things and why are you always
[1:26:06] looking at the moon and all these cars
[1:26:07] you know you look like you're the starry
[1:26:08] look in your eyes and why is this and
[1:26:10] she said well
[1:26:11] on the other side of the sea
[1:26:14] my sweetheart's there
[1:26:16] and and and I'm going to be here for a
[1:26:18] few more months my my my my art degree
[1:26:21] is nearly done
[1:26:22] and and he's building a house for us
[1:26:24] back home
[1:26:25] and we promised one to another we're
[1:26:27] gonna live true
[1:26:28] and then one day I'm going to get on a
[1:26:30] boat or a plane and I'm gonna go home
[1:26:31] I'm gonna get married
[1:26:33] so so she would say you know in a
[1:26:35] certain state of America in a certain
[1:26:36] city in a certain town on a certain
[1:26:39] Street there's a certain young man
[1:26:41] that I fell in love with and we and
[1:26:43] that's all I can think about is him
[1:26:45] that's why I live like this and you know
[1:26:47] I'm a Christian of different things you
[1:26:49] know we can be the same kind of way
[1:26:51] there's a certain heaven
[1:26:53] and in that certain Heaven there's a
[1:26:55] there's a certain Jesus who came to came
[1:26:58] from glory to Earth purchased our
[1:27:00] Salvation washed all our sins away put
[1:27:02] his love in our hearts amen that we can
[1:27:04] look up and say it now on a certain date
[1:27:06] I don't know when but it's going to be
[1:27:07] soon he's going to come from that
[1:27:09] certain Heaven he's going to come and
[1:27:11] catch me away and we're going to go up
[1:27:13] into glory and be there for eternity
[1:27:14] that's why we live the way we live
[1:27:18] Hallelujah
[1:27:20] you know it's so good if we could just
[1:27:22] look up and you know
[1:27:24] we can we can look to where we're going
[1:27:27] I think it'll just refocus Our Lives I
[1:27:29] think all the all the nonsense and stuff
[1:27:31] will just kind of Fritter away
[1:27:33] amen
[1:27:35] amen praise the Lord Brother Bible says
[1:27:37] in here and recognizing acting on the
[1:27:38] word of God
[1:27:40] he said he said but the sea will be
[1:27:42] quiet there brother speaking of
[1:27:44] um over in eternity he says just across
[1:27:46] the Sea Under there's a certain place
[1:27:47] called Heaven there's a certain one
[1:27:49] called Jesus in this heaven and one day
[1:27:51] he took all took away all my sins and I
[1:27:53] promise him I live true to him I do the
[1:27:55] things that he wanted me to do that's
[1:27:56] the reason I'm not ashamed of this
[1:27:57] gospel it's the power of God unto
[1:27:59] salvation that's what makes me a that's
[1:28:02] what makes a Christian live different he
[1:28:04] is different because he's got something
[1:28:06] to live different for
[1:28:08] I mean we've got something different to
[1:28:09] live for it's not just being a what what
[1:28:12] what the world would say religious or a
[1:28:14] Christian but it's eternal life
[1:28:16] hey man where where we can see and you
[1:28:18] know even even these last few years
[1:28:20] we've seen God become more real Among Us
[1:28:22] his spirit's moving in a greater way he
[1:28:24] goes promises are becoming more alive
[1:28:26] you know he's pouring out his Spirit
[1:28:28] more and more you know our camp minis
[1:28:30] are getting better I believe our church
[1:28:32] services are getting better you know the
[1:28:34] word is getting richer what's that
[1:28:35] heaven is coming down amen Time and
[1:28:38] Eternity are blending together in a
[1:28:40] greater way you know we're lining up
[1:28:42] with the word like never before but
[1:28:44] you'll have realized more and more that
[1:28:46] we're not just Sinners safe by Grace I
[1:28:48] remember we are the elected seed of God
[1:28:50] Amen we came from him and we go back to
[1:28:53] him and he cannot lose a part of himself
[1:28:56] that's one thing God cannot do is he
[1:28:57] cannot lose a part of himself and we're
[1:29:00] going to realize that we're part of him
[1:29:01] that's why he called you that's why he
[1:29:03] loves you that's why he died for you
[1:29:05] it's because you're a part of him maybe
[1:29:07] but as a spirit is pouring out more and
[1:29:10] more Hallelujah who feels that way
[1:29:12] God is moving in a greater way because
[1:29:15] he's wanting us to realize we are we are
[1:29:18] closer than ever before to crossing over
[1:29:20] we are closer than ever before seeing
[1:29:22] the dead in Christ race you know seems
[1:29:24] to be there's more over there than there
[1:29:26] is here and there's more dead in Christ
[1:29:28] over there waiting amen Hallelujah but
[1:29:31] they're waiting for us to finish this
[1:29:33] race finish our course amen but you know
[1:29:37] if we could just catch a glimpse I
[1:29:38] believe we could just look beyond the
[1:29:40] curtain of time
[1:29:41] it would just it would just calm all our
[1:29:43] fears it would take away all worry it
[1:29:46] would take away all sorrow it would take
[1:29:49] away all questions if we could just look
[1:29:50] past the curtain of time and even
[1:29:52] brother Brown when he gave the account
[1:29:54] of when he was taken past the curtain of
[1:29:56] time he's in a real body he was young
[1:29:57] against her all the redeemed you know he
[1:30:00] would sing that song let me look past a
[1:30:02] good time even praise in that song Lord
[1:30:04] let them look past the curtain of time
[1:30:06] and you know the Lord actually lets us
[1:30:08] look past a curtain a Time
[1:30:10] yes owl I've never I've never seen a
[1:30:12] curtain move and then there's eternity
[1:30:13] well then how does he do it well this
[1:30:16] eternity comes down
[1:30:18] you feel its impact you feel its
[1:30:21] presence you feel his presence what's
[1:30:24] that that's that's eternity reaching in
[1:30:26] and getting a hold of your heart and
[1:30:28] speaking to you and touching your spirit
[1:30:30] and saying it's okay
[1:30:32] it's okay you're gonna get there you're
[1:30:34] part of me I want to remind you once
[1:30:37] again amen that there is a heaven to go
[1:30:39] to there's a real Jesus that's going to
[1:30:41] come we're going to physically meet him
[1:30:42] in the air that's what Believers believe
[1:30:44] Amen to the presence we feel here will
[1:30:46] be multiplied a billion times in Rupp
[1:30:48] and Glory but it's Heaven reaching down
[1:30:51] into darkness into this age to get a
[1:30:53] hold of you and say look there's a land
[1:30:55] beyond the river for you amen and you're
[1:30:57] not going to make it haphazardly I've
[1:30:59] made a way for you to get there by my
[1:31:02] blood by the cross amen I have made a
[1:31:04] way for you to get into Glory
[1:31:07] hallelujah amen Faith you you think
[1:31:10] about these things it just to me it just
[1:31:12] makes me feel I know faith is not a
[1:31:13] feeling but it just gives me such a
[1:31:15] feeling of assurance and it makes my
[1:31:17] faith I feel rise when you think about
[1:31:19] how we were not looking for God but God
[1:31:21] was looking for you and I amen because
[1:31:24] you had a place in that land beyond the
[1:31:25] river he says I can't leave that place
[1:31:27] vacant I'm not getting 70 a pass Mark is
[1:31:30] not a pass in God's books it's a hundred
[1:31:33] percent fifty percent is not a past
[1:31:35] Market 50 well I got 50 of my children
[1:31:38] here I'm happy no that's a hundred
[1:31:40] percent it's it's it's all or nothing
[1:31:42] like he'd tell the parable of the of the
[1:31:45] Shepherd that lost the other one sheep
[1:31:46] went Australia the 99 were there you
[1:31:48] think 99 sheep are good well I've still
[1:31:50] got 99 of my flock you know one sure
[1:31:52] there's losses you know you know
[1:31:55] statistically during the year and blah
[1:31:56] blah blah blah but no a real Shepherd is
[1:31:58] not satisfied when one is lost
[1:32:01] he wants the whole hundred there he
[1:32:03] wants the full hundred there and it's
[1:32:06] the same thing with our Lord Jesus
[1:32:07] Christ he wants a full hundred percent
[1:32:09] of his children that's why he comes
[1:32:11] service after service touches our hearts
[1:32:14] speaks to our lives we just opened the
[1:32:16] Bible during the week and it just
[1:32:18] blesses us we pray so thank you Lord his
[1:32:20] presence comes down and what's that
[1:32:22] because he's reminding you there's a
[1:32:24] lamb beyond the river now the devil
[1:32:26] wants to put a big concrete bunker over
[1:32:28] us and tell us it's not real and God's
[1:32:31] not there and God doesn't care and if
[1:32:34] God was real why did all these things
[1:32:35] happen in your life and all these
[1:32:36] questions and things that doesn't change
[1:32:39] see that's the devil trying to
[1:32:40] overshadow you to keep you from the
[1:32:41] promise of God but if you can look
[1:32:43] Beyond because remember it may be cloudy
[1:32:46] I don't know what it's doing outside but
[1:32:47] remember it doesn't matter how stormy
[1:32:49] the world gets there's always the sun
[1:32:51] shining somewhere amen but just he's
[1:32:53] going to change atmospheres from the
[1:32:55] Earthly up into the Heavenly you'll see
[1:32:56] the sun shining sure is the world Amen
[1:32:59] you can see your you know NASA will give
[1:33:01] images and videos of great hurricanes
[1:33:03] moving on the earth they're not caught
[1:33:04] up in those winds they're way up in
[1:33:06] space
[1:33:07] actually those storms can't get to them
[1:33:09] they're well above the storm the storm
[1:33:11] can't physically get to the space
[1:33:13] station
[1:33:14] Hallelujah they just watch it on the
[1:33:16] earth they're far above that storm
[1:33:18] that's the same thing with the believer
[1:33:19] we can be lifted up
[1:33:21] in the spiritual realm we may be on the
[1:33:24] Earth but spiritually we're in Heavenly
[1:33:25] places amen there may be a hurricane
[1:33:27] coming through but we can just be as
[1:33:29] calm as calm can be
[1:33:32] you know I remember the first storm I
[1:33:34] was ever in
[1:33:35] um was in um was it American Samoa
[1:33:37] there's a cyclone coming and and it was
[1:33:40] going to flatten it was going to go
[1:33:41] right over the island thankfully it just
[1:33:42] went around the South Coast but where we
[1:33:44] were living I think I related this I
[1:33:45] know when but you know where we're
[1:33:47] living it was like lava rock there's
[1:33:49] about this much soil and and so what
[1:33:52] happened is this this hurricane came
[1:33:53] through or this Cyclone whatever it's
[1:33:55] called and and I've never seen so much
[1:33:58] water in the air with the rain and the
[1:33:59] wind so much noise it never heard it in
[1:34:01] my life and Big Trees big massive trees
[1:34:03] you think would never fall they all went
[1:34:05] over the root system was like as half
[1:34:08] the size of this room
[1:34:09] the whole thing just fell over the only
[1:34:11] thing left left up was a coconut tree
[1:34:13] coconut trees because they can flex and
[1:34:15] so the next morning after this thing
[1:34:17] went through thankfully we didn't lose
[1:34:18] the roof but a few people left roofs um
[1:34:20] lost roofs and then it was such a weird
[1:34:23] look like there's a kind of a small
[1:34:24] Valley here on the side of Stokes Valley
[1:34:26] and if you can imagine that that that
[1:34:28] there is like one side of that Valley's
[1:34:31] been like ripped up with a with like a
[1:34:33] big weed eater someone's just got and
[1:34:35] just weeded the whole like like all the
[1:34:37] trees are just Twigs the other side is
[1:34:39] is like it's never been touched and that
[1:34:40] was like all around the island like that
[1:34:42] total devastation powers out water was
[1:34:44] that all those things and then so now
[1:34:47] we had to we had to men I think my
[1:34:49] brother where these blunt machetes and
[1:34:51] we had to like cut through all the all
[1:34:52] the Fallen trees so my dad could get on
[1:34:55] his motorbike and go see if the factory
[1:34:56] he worked at was still there and so so
[1:34:59] this is the next day after the storms
[1:35:00] come through it's still blowing gusts
[1:35:02] it's still blowing a gale and coconuts
[1:35:04] are heavier and they're all up there
[1:35:06] still and these trees are Swang like
[1:35:08] this with the Gus and we're cutting
[1:35:10] we're cutting through you know these
[1:35:12] these Fallen trees with these blunt
[1:35:13] machetes and I didn't know the Lord then
[1:35:15] so here I am singing all the hymns that
[1:35:18] I heard it at you know the chapel at
[1:35:20] school
[1:35:21] where because if that thing hits me I'm
[1:35:24] not here I'm gone I'm gone thankfully
[1:35:27] while I'm here but you know I was afraid
[1:35:29] in the storm because I didn't because I
[1:35:32] didn't know him who was greater than the
[1:35:33] storm right but then now now there's not
[1:35:36] a storm but then when Chris and I were
[1:35:37] living in Christchurch when the first
[1:35:39] first earthquake struck you know we we
[1:35:42] somehow got out of bed and it was like
[1:35:43] the vile like the like the earthquake
[1:35:45] was like violent this way and this way
[1:35:48] and you know we got down by our front
[1:35:50] door and we started praying and the
[1:35:52] place is still shaking and the prince of
[1:35:54] God just fell down and we were shouting
[1:35:56] and rejoicing Hallelujah no fear and
[1:36:00] it's not something you generate there
[1:36:01] was just no fear why because because the
[1:36:03] one greater than the earthquake was
[1:36:05] there and I believe it was a storm I
[1:36:07] wouldn't have fear as well why because
[1:36:08] the one greater than the storm is in you
[1:36:11] that's why I can say you can be living
[1:36:12] on the earth in a storm but if you're in
[1:36:14] Heavenly places in him you don't need to
[1:36:16] fear anything
[1:36:18] Hallelujah
[1:36:19] Hallelujah because he's greater than
[1:36:21] those things
[1:36:22] amen praise the Lord have gone for time
[1:36:24] okay we're going to wind this up a bit
[1:36:27] amen
[1:36:29] Hallelujah you see the Apostle Paul was
[1:36:31] tired he had an absolute of the word
[1:36:35] Christ himself was as absolute
[1:36:37] and that's what the Christian needs
[1:36:39] today in this atomic age and this time
[1:36:41] of uncertainty we need something besides
[1:36:43] just an experience of joining church we
[1:36:44] need an anchor in absolute that you know
[1:36:46] because churches will fail people will
[1:36:49] fail but Christ cannot fail he is the
[1:36:52] absolute to the believer and of Christ
[1:36:54] as you're absolute you're tied to him
[1:36:55] and if he is your absolute you're tied
[1:36:58] to him then you're tied to the word
[1:37:01] a phase you're absolute
[1:37:03] I might actually leave it there but I
[1:37:05] want to ask you the question what are
[1:37:06] you apprehended by
[1:37:08] are you apprehended by your past pain
[1:37:11] failure ego self
[1:37:14] what's the thing that governs your life
[1:37:16] parasocial relationships on social media
[1:37:20] or is it the word of God
[1:37:22] we're all apprehended by something
[1:37:24] you know we can be apprehended by
[1:37:26] religion but is it the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:37:28] the word himself
[1:37:30] what are you apprehended by because what
[1:37:33] you're apprehended by you will try and
[1:37:34] apprehend
[1:37:35] people like like someone who's who's
[1:37:37] apprehended by by by like pornography or
[1:37:41] drugs or whatever it is any addiction it
[1:37:45] is that spirit's apprehended the person
[1:37:48] they won't apprehend it
[1:37:49] right yeah but if the Lord has
[1:37:52] apprehended you
[1:37:54] you want more of him
[1:37:56] so who's the main one in your life this
[1:37:58] morning
[1:37:59] amen this is the hour where the promises
[1:38:03] are not afar off but they are here
[1:38:07] and we are seeking a land beyond the
[1:38:08] river
[1:38:09] I trust that you can just take this
[1:38:11] morning and say Lord I'm so thankful
[1:38:13] there's a land beyond the river
[1:38:15] and you are influencing me from that
[1:38:17] land Heaven is influencing I've been
[1:38:19] apprehended by that land that's why I
[1:38:21] can say I'm a pilgrim and a stranger I'm
