TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Amen good morning everybody [Music] welcome to church this morning you made it so when I was a young fellow where to walk two to ten miles and the snow barefoot uphill both ways [Music] look the most powerful or the the the strongest toughest attitude that the human can have is a positive attitude you know if you have a negative attitude it's hard to get through things but if you have a positive attitude you get through things and faith gives you a positive attitude because you always believe it's all going to be a right it's going to get better God's in control all of these pods that the positivity that faith brings you can make it through any situation you hear of people Christians ending up and concentration camps and the way that they go through the testimonies of how they went through it as opposed to someone with no faith a no but no no God went through it we're totally different and it was their attitude it was that that their faith pushed through everything you know we can be in in in any situation in faith a positive attitude of faith will just get you through no problem that's this is a bit of a lesson in life you know because we all go through hard things but it's our attitude that's our attitude that that changes how we go through it you know and and the what the trials that we go through in life we kind of have to be quite tough to get through them is that that that's just how this whole thing works you know and I think Christians like the Lord he was tough he knew he had to go to Calvary but he just set his eyes on that and he went for it you know and I know it's a hard thing to say but you know God God can give us such a positive attitude that no matter what circumstance we're going through we can't just press on through it regardless and you know the more we the more we walk with the Lord the more our attitude changes so fast raining and pouring with rain we go to church because you know what I met you're not I'm saying like if everything's going wrong we don't can we carry on we we rejoice we carry on that's that's ultimately how a Christian operates you know no matter what the circumstance we press on in faith and we press on with joy that's how we do it you know Satan hates it but that's how that's how that Christian does it let some stand this morning in the first I mean I'm actually going to sing as I've got the joy joy joy joy down in my heart but we'll just some pray this morning Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord that we can be gathered here this morning Lord to come and worship and praise you Lord Jesus

forever more Lord Jesus father we humble ourselves under your mighty hand in this solar moment father Lord as we have gathered Lord around your throne this morning Lord Jesus because of the blood that was shed for us on Calvary and Lord Jesus how we read of that great historical fact they that God became a man and blood to a second Adam Lord Jesus to pay that penalty that the first Adam Oh God picked up on a bill so as we speak Lord in this time and terminology but father Lord the devil tried to destroy it all and he corrupted your church he corrupted the whole program and caused the Dark Age but Lord you said I'd restore and father you Lord you kept your word Lord Jesus and you've restored back and you've brought back Lord you no matter how far how dark it got Lord how bad it became you brought it back Lord there's nothing impossible to you Lord and far the Lord we read of a church that was in the first love and Lord by the deceitfulness of Cernan and Lord the busyness of life and the cares of this world and the lust of the flesh and agreed in this body oh god they left their first love and the church slipped but Lord Jesus father you said that the church would come back you said that they would be a bride without spot or wrinkle that she would come right up into that first love again right up Lord but not just on a collective general bride level but a personal reality and I pray Lord that this morning Lord I believe you want to speak Lord that you have a word and season for your bride and I pray Lord that that reality that first love you administer it you would speak it for us a bit Lord you would unfold the burden on your heart this morning Lord hallelujah Lord Jesus we just surrender ourselves to you and us that you would speak Oh Lord how father we are so insufficient to stand here before your bride before the purchase of your blood the Lord you are sufficient your word is enough your anointing is powerful Oh Lord stir every hardened Lord may Lord our lives father just come into alignment with the divine purpose this morning take control of every spirit in this room Lord a rebuke every spirit of unbelief in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke the spirit of criticism in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah I rebuke the spirit of homosexuality in the name of Jesus Christ Oh father and I rebuke the spirit of procrastination in the name of Jesus Christ today is the day now is the hour to cross over let us cross over Jordan Lord Jesus let us walk into our inheritance Lord not one who shall be left behind we claim all hallelujah all shall cross all shall come and none shall be left behind hallelujah none shall stay under the power of Pharaoh hallelujah Oh Lord no no not one who's not one child not one Hut not one soul shall be left behind but we claim all Oh Lord Jesus let this be a moment let this be a day let this be the hour Oh Lord we lives can be changed whoo Oh Lord take control father I pray that you would grant an amnesty this morning father and that spirit realm where the devil attacks so vividly and wildly I rebuke that devil Oh Lord Graz the amnesty father for those that haven't crossed Lord Jesus from the lies of Satan that they may be free to make a decision free to cross over that Jordan free to lay everything down and to realize realization to realize being how good it is the land flowing with milk and honey but then as we heard is just the beginning it's just the beginning oh this popcorn this grain is golden grain this inheritance this sonship to be taken may Lord Jesus you lead us now we just humble ourselves under your mighty hand we bless you we worship you lord have you will have your way now in the name of Jesus Christ amen alleluiah god bless you musicians thank you brother Isaac it's a real honor to be here I want to also just you know honor the pastor and has has work that the Lord does through him here and also to just be grateful for this opportunity to minister to the bride here in Wellington amen the ark has returned to Wellington here we here we see the evidence amen faith is the substance of things hoped for there was a time where we hoped for this there was a time where it was a hope so but now we know so now there's a substance now there's a people now there's people getting born again in Wellington people getting lives changed in Wellington now today every single person in this room can have a life change who wants a life change we want something to happen to them today who wants to go further in the Lord today amen who wants the devil to go to lower and lower today amen okay well you can have that claim it may hold of it Amen this turn while we're standing to Isaiah chapter 40 and this morning we would like to speak on when the valleys and mountains join in perfect love amen when the valleys and mountains join in perfect love my now this is a subject that just goes beyond human ability to convey but let this be an experience and has been preached an adventure who's ready for an adventure amen hallelujah the Lord is a God of adventures amen he wants to take us on an adventure he wants to take us higher he wants to show us his glory he wants to us to be excited by what he shows us who's ready to be excited who's already excited amen you look excited I'm so glad hallelujah amen Isaiah 40 verse 3 to 5 it says here the voice of hermit in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God every Valley shall be exalted and every mountain and Hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain hmm I like that and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated hallelujah isn't he wonderful isn't he so good a man he's done many wonderful things my lord he done done amen hallelujah he said here give us power he done done amen he give us grace he give us healing he give us rapture he give us family oh my what else what more could you ask for amen don't worry about all the material all that stuff you know that's incidental but what we have here is the treasure we have treasure amen pearls of great price and you know as we enter earn and as we worship Herman and just surrender all and allow you know when you get operated on and the surgeon puts you under anesthesia you don't there's no resistance you just you've surrendered everything to the surgeon right and it's just a man who's had training under the tree of knowledge right and we thank the Lord through medicine but you know that you're still surrendering your whole life for him to work through open-heart surgery so this morning if you're if you have a heart problem or whatever problem there may be and you know that the medical field can help you you and you're willing you're willing to surrender your whole life now you could die on that operating table you do realize that you know this is like Huayra stuff but you're willing now for the opportunity to get healed from that thing you're willing to lay it all down right you're willing to just lay your life down completely on that table and even take some funny stuff into you and you'd come you're gone now you're gone and keep you alive by machines now and then let him take these knives and cut and do all those things and put other stuff in there you're willing now if you're willing to do that I just encourage you this morning just to invite Jesus the divine physician the great physician invite him to your pew right now just invite them to your pew and say Lord I can trust a medical doctor to do that I can trust you to do something on my heart today because we are in a season now and I'm jumping right to the very I guess that's all right because it's nice to know where we're getting to so we are in a season now I really believe this and I'll share a lot about it but we're in a season now where the Lord is laying a plain battlefield where the devil cannot hide you understand do you know one of the greatest battlefields this really tickled me a lot I really enjoyed thinking about this but one of the greatest battlefields of all time as the valley of megiddo and it's a valley where you cannot hide you're in a fight and you're fighting until the winner is won amen so what the Lord wants to do and what I believe he's doing because we're at the end of all ends and the end of the end of the end right we know that we're right here so now he's saying that devil ain't gonna hide from nothing anymore I'm going to bring such a climate into this church don't worry about anyone else let's just think about here I'm gonna bring such a climate into here where the devil cannot hide anymore amen and all the little nuances that was just little shadows that was against you the little pieces of enemy maybe you've already got the enemy you've conquered that piece of lamb but he's under tribute you understand what I mean you know Israel when they conquered land they conquered some and the enemy got abolished which is what God wanted he didn't want them to cut the enemy under tribute because he knew that the enemy would still cause a form in this side so he wanted the enemy to be eradicated amen now many now for us who's walked now in this message and had the sanctifying power of God and the change of the heart and all these things and you and and we've gone like Israel through the land holding the captain's hand turning not that way or that way but he's leading us and we're holding his head and he's he's given us he's led the campaign and many times we've conquered things and got this and laid hold of that inheritance laid hold of this character laid hold of this trait laid hold of there but many as well as Israel the same thing repeats some of those enemies have just gone under tribute and just as my new minority has remained in there and hasn't been fully abolished yet all right and every now and again a situation in your life comes up and that little enemy under tribute Rises its little head and causes you strife or causes trouble and you're like Lord but I've been delivered but this little thing now I believe that but but you see now I read to you how I read that what I read there is the prophecy of John the Baptist right so so the this is the Ministry of Elijah now the Ministry of Elijah is sent to level all these things out and make all these things straight so the devil has nowhere to hide so the Lord can come and reveal himself true and faithful and rebuke the enemy and get rid of all the enemy not just some not just most not put them under tribute and just deal with it and live with it but abolish hallelujah to abolish the enemy therefore there needs to be in your life a battle an array on a playing field amen here we go can I have the musicians please don't there is the thought in a nutshell so I just want to read from Isaiah 51 you don't need a turn there verse 3 says for the Lord shall comfort Zion hello Zion hello precious bride of Jesus Christ the Lord shall comfort Zion he wants to comfort you amen so now I'm gonna take what John the Baptist did to a dispensation to a group to a nation to prepare a people from a religious can confusion or under Herod and under these great church and States merge together under Babylonian rule and all mixed and he leveled it out to get the people back to a point to Christ now I want to take what happened on an age level and I want to show you how it's going to happen inside you amen and so it says here for the Lord shall comfort Zion he will comfort all who waste places amen and he will make her wilderness like Eden who's thankful for that who's thankful that you know you started this walk and inside you was a wilderness a troublesome place but he promised and you can say every time you go for a trial in you're in a battle and it's hard or something happens you can say Lord you promised in it conditions and a need in it conditions the lion shall lay down with the lamb amen the wolf shall lead the child and all of those things right because this is a need in ur condition it's a harmonious condition and that is what has meant to happen in your spirit realm there's meant to be an e dinner condition in there now that is your inheritance and if I could encourage you to do something put that on your list just put that on your list now you can put whatever you feel lid on your list remember we've got a list is he rung on a list the dinner I make a list I made a list I made a list and I enjoyed making that list and then I held the list up and I said Lord here's my list and I know this is my inheritance and I'm gonna I'm gonna have this and I say Lord whatever it takes oh I need this many things I think there was 15 things or 18 things on my list you know and they weren't just one word things this was like a detailed Commission put that on your list my spirit realm to be a dinner amen spirit round to be eat dinner hallelujah oh my how easy am not easy but let's just cuz they'll still be war fear but how much greater could it be if your spirit realm your emotional realm could be a dinner with the lamb lays down with the lion amen where the child is led by the wolf and it's all in perfect unity and harmony in love love love is the key make her a wilderness like Eden and her desert like the Garden of God amen now that's now turning what was no man's land amen and we heard that in the in the and at the camp we heard that you know because it's so it seems to be something that we kind of think of us out our mind to be like this barren no-man's land right and and we just and it's like just this war ground right and and and it's no man's land but actually it's meant to be God's land God wants that land he wants to plant his plants in there he wants his flowers to be in there he wants his milk and honey to be in there milk and honey the land shall be flowing with milk and honey your land shall be flowing with milk and honey amen claim it right now just claim it to save my land my land shall be flowing with milk and honey my spirit realm shall be a need in it condition my wilderness shall be a Garden of God that's what I claim and I know that there's many times that things come up in my life where you know I thought that was already conquered but found out that the enemy was just under tribute and he had been subdued but you know when that came down so far and something pushed so much then it came up again I'm like oh I realize now that has not gone completely and it is and the reason is now because at the end time there needs to be the full effect of Elijah's ministry the full effect you know because you know I'm gonna tie what the prophecy of John the Baptist's I will make a way for the Lord so the Lord can be revealed I'll make the crooked paths straight I'm going to take the mountains I'm gonna bring them down the valleys I'm gonna bring them up and we're gonna have a battlefield where the devil cannot hide now I tell you what in the church environment here in this church environment the devil cannot hide in perfect love okay so now the devil can hide very easily if the church is caught up and in criticism its caught up with stickers even we can hide very easily in there because what happens is when the stickers come out nobody wants to share what's really going on inside they don't really want to share they feel afraid because they're going to get criticized about it or they go there's it's not an environment for healing but when the perfect love of God is manifested now people feel like they can share they can talk that love can bring healing and restoration because now we're speaking and now it's open now the devil can't work anymore because of love I'm an oh my love this is one of probably one of my favorite scriptures in the Bible I love it so much II there's so many types and so many key there's like one of the key stones for me in the scriptures is this Isaiah 51 verse 3 I see the whole chapter of Isaiah 51 is glorious as you know I've preached on it for those of you that have been around since the beginning I've preached on it many times actually so yeah I might be sounding to some of you like a broken record but but it does get more and more every time I preach it because the word opens amen so this is here and who deserts like the garden of the Lord amen joy and gladness shall be found there and so let's put let's let's form a search party into your spirit realm right now and let's do a search party and what do we find in your spirit realm that just be honest with yourself now we're not going to go searching inside your spirit of course right and you know you come for counseling to the pastor and you go through stuff and you you know sometimes the pastors and and the counselors they the things that they listen to what they're discovering that's inside a human spirit can be very very dark can be very horrible can be very bad can be very evil and yet because it's being shared because it's being brought out because it's being confessed because it's being shared and prayed about it gets defeated and that spirit realm gets cleansed but let's do a search down into your spirit round now and say you know what is in there what's in my mind what's in my spirit what's laying in there is it joy and gladness and if you find that there is a lot of other things in there that is hindering then you say Lord you said that my spirit realm shall be joy and gladness and I'm gonna claim that I'm gonna lay hold of it this is my inheritance and I'm gonna have that Amen hallelujah and you serve the devil as notice the devil has the leaf because God promised restoration and so you are on an inevitable path to glory you are on an inevitable part an evitable path to perfection you are on an inevitable path to no wrinkles physically and spiritually hahaha who likes that who's happy about that we are all in an eternal youth camp right let's have youth camp you ever youth camp you really you're a Tina let's not be this old wise fellow you know let's just be 18 again amen come on amen are you with me let's be 19 again I think it's that song isn't it I'm here I'm 19 again amen well you really are because you know that's kind of the image that God saw when you're at your prime of you know that very threshold where you grew right up to that image and then you know from that point then now because of death this sits them but really at that very point is where a theophany is baba so anything that's cocked true anything that you can look at and search your heart because you should search and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in the Lord's sight right so anything else any shadow any hundreds anything never stand for it stand against that resist that resist the devil just keep resisting don't give up just keep pushing just keep saying Lord you promised lawyer you promised what can I do Lord Lord Lord led me to something that's going to open up this issue and deal with it he is the captain he's the five-star general because you can come up against an enemy like Israel and look at it and they're surrounding you and you don't know what to do and this is going to happen in this happening and all of our lives right now right now it's all happening we're in a battle right now this was an ordained battle this is a battle that's completely ordained it's a race that is set it's a race that is set it's set before you and he makes a table of a feast for you in the presence of your enemies to certain feast and eat those nutrients and those vitamins that are going to remove those things he said you are sanctified by the word that I preached you are cleansed by the word so there is a power in the word now as an been always preachers this and it's such a powerful foot but it's hard in a humanistic way to convey it but if you can realize how powerful the word is if it can when you see it in its spirit and what it really is and and and its greatness can be realized in your own mind and huh it'll have a greater effect in your life amen and I'm not because of me or being or anyone but and the sermon respects the Prophet deals with how to respect an office in a ministry an office and each other and all the different levels of respect you know to a point now and this when I first became a believer way way but not that far back but way back for me it's a long time when I first I when I read the book of Acts and I saw them getting healed by Peters shadow I thought my goodness I thought why can't that happen to us and then I started hearing this one talking about that one this one thing that one's wrong this one's got funny doctrines there and I realize there's no respect and the people you know like for me a young guy and you'll get may I'm not talking to you know for us as the people but and there are people that would go off don't worry about listening to brother and he's just a young fellow you know still learning don't bother they've missed it it's not me it's not me your faith draws on a gift that God placed in me you can deal directly with God right now don't deal with me just just delete me out of your eyesight close your eyes pretend that there's a minister that's been ministering for 10,000 years hallelujah an eternal being to minister then my shadow walking past there's no shadow in here will have you healed now I'm not meaning me okay I just mean like there is this if we could really see and be impacted by the enormity the glory that is being manifested right now and in each service and when God moves and when he speaks to you and you are connected to the very person of Jesus Christ this service as you are dealing with the Lord deal with the Lord right now amen I really want to get to the store day so I want to read from 1 John 4:19 don't worry about turning this very short by the time you get there we'll be finished we love him because he first loved us you know there is no there's no out for the devil and that there's no in for the devil in that we love him because he first loved us and he elected loved us he just said I love them that's it end of story I love them and then they'll love me is it in that day you shall know that I am in my father so there was the revelation of the Godhead but he takes it a bit further now and he says actually you're part of the God you are part of the Godhead did you realize that you are part of the Godhead now you don't rule like God or anything but you're part of them you're in them right it's just and you and me in that day you shall know who knows that do you know that has it impacted your life so much you think war Lord Jesus thank you thank you that I don't just see you as a triune personalities of three people oh my and then I'm just this little piece of dust and yes flesh speaking bare dust but inside the soul inside you you're part of him amen and that's why that love says we love him because he first loved us so you see let me just I'm just gonna go down but John the Baptist ministry was to level the playing field right level the battleground bring it all plain so that there would could be a direct contact with the very message of the hour which is the and he was embodied and flesh the word for their hour became flesh and he ministered in his own flesh body the Lamb that would pay for the sins of the world okay and John introduced that body introduced that lamb introduced the message of the hour and took the the elect of the patriarchs in the elect that was under all those priests that were pointing back to Moses back back in a river shimmer and them to look to the message his message was a person whose message stood hallelujah with brazen feet of judgment on the Babylonian religion of the Pharisees his message spoke hallelujah and thundered hey men against the enemy that life he looked destroyed the works of darkness but look at the very transaction how it all transpired look at how it all worked didn't look like much did it didn't look like you know if you look at it objectively now we see it by revelation we see it with eyes that can see but you look at that on a worldly level on an intellectual level and you think that was just a failure all it was as he just came up against religious people he had faith healing but then they all refused them and he just got rebuked then the table's liked him more than the leaders of religion the dibbles worshiped but all those leaders of religion rejected so people called him Beelzebub they called him all these names they called him a cult they said that you're following a man are they following a man were they following a man they were following the God of heaven manifested in a man that was introduced by John the Baptist John the Baptist message was there the greatest times in history the greatest manifestation of any life the greatest display of power that had ever struck the earth and we see it so powerful right because we're seeing with faith but to all and even the disciples Leibman they must many times they must it they couldn't see it and he got you know he said how long must I suffer you Philip how long you know and he got tired he got worn in the spirit because of their unbelief and all those things to really see the glory of the message of John to really comprehend and be impacted and to understand this message that John had brought him this being this person of the word that was walking me therefore the way that they saw him that was the level of his impact upon them the what they saw what they conceived what came in their well he was manifested in front of them would be the level of impact that he would have upon them right so the great things that it was prophesied he would make the mountains flared and the valleys up and the crooked path straight they thought the Messiah was gonna come in and the red carpet roll down from heaven and crowns and beauty majesty the earth would tremble and shake and yes so humble so simple now history has repeated the very same thing is happening right now the very same transaction is taking place right now let me tie Isaiah 40 now I can't I can use the scriptures I can use many scriptures but I'm going to just use what the Ohio River and 1930s era Elijah Amen who's thankful for Elijah alright who's thankful that God sent Elijah oh my what a glorious thing that is what a powerful loving God that he would restore it back he would there would be a repeat Ministry of John the Baptist but this repeat ministry would come and do the same the spirit and power of Elijah to come and do the same thing but on a higher level because it's on a spiritual level to cover the whole earth not just a natural level to introduce a natural man a natural message with a supernatural life but an a living natural Lamb he introduced to a natural nation in one geographical area but this Elijah would come to introduce a spiritual fulfillment to cover the earth to cover all Kindred's tongues and Nations and he would introduce the same person the same message to take the Hutt's of all of the children who's looking at modernism and hollywood and all these other things and in looking up into this and dad and ideas and tree of knowledge and all it take the hearts and turn it back to the same message as john the same person was introduced hallelujah and right now the message of John and the message of William Brennan is in this room and he is the same person manifesting but now because the lamb paid the penalty the lamb came the lamp a penalty so now that person that was introduced by Elijah as a new as in me now that's been 50 years since this transaction manifested in its full measure where the divine one would come down and a prophet would introduce this message this person this being would come down and unite with his people 50 years it's been and there's been some tumultuous seas there's been some enemies coming in there's been fights on every hand there's been a timer judges this downs ups everything but there has to come a time where the purpose the intent of this ministry would come and level the playing field and level the battleground so that all those little enemies all those little foxes that are spoiling the fruit on your vine my all of them shall be done oh and we are right here right now we are right here right now just sharing these things to declare to you this the moment that of time around now we can rest assured ed if you struggle to love many of us struggle to love I struggle to love I really do because my family was an open loving family so therefore my subconscious as it takes ages to open up and really love you know and some families it's easy it's just family cultures family natures whatever but the Lord all that stuff right now if you're struggling to love to love your brothers to express it to say it can you comfortably go up to anyone in this church and tell them what looking in their eyes I love you can you do it or is there something in your spirit that feels like it's hard even though you do but it's hard and when they say it to you do you do you find it hard do you find it as they like things that resist there is it like all it's a bit too much should I it should we be talking about this is this comfortable to you alright you see now all of it those little niggly things that that make you uncomfortable and these types of transactions all of those things shall be healed you will love freely you will love openly now I'm talking about pure love now I'm not talking about figlio love or any type of and corrupt corruptible love I'm talking about now divine love love that will work no ill to its neighbor love that will just you know I'm gonna read some things man if we ever get through this it'll be a miracle but man alive this never ends men it never ends because we're speaking of eternal things we're tapping into these eternal things to identify what's happening right now and if you can just catch that that right now the valleys and the mountains are coming because of love only happens in love when love is restored what is love it's the Holy Ghost now there's been 50 years of message transpiring but the Holy Ghost has been sitting on a perch I know that sounds bad but the hope that the churches have been full of legal environments where the Holy Ghost cannot really move properly and if it does move has generally been on the far end of fanaticism has to mean too much it's all majored on the emotions or it's gone way over the side and it's been too starchy and to legal and once you get on a pendulum it's very hard to get back as it be people because you're moving all these minds and all these convictions and all the ministry has even been preached then a pastor not mean been but you know and then a pastor may catch it and we've seen this happen in New Zealand a pastors caught it or a new pastors coming and you got to bring the church back to where the dynamics and mechanic can operate properly and it's very hard because it's years where the Holy Ghost is set on the perch people are sealed they're saved they've been sealed away but he's been sitting there grieved because they've been thinking this doing that what have they done and what do we all do and we're all guilty of it sharing our conscience and God help us - you know when you first got saved and you first really got saved you know you really got safe and and your conscience was wrong and you didn't do anything wrong that you thought anyway you didn't speed you didn't ticks while driving you didn't talk about anybody you just loved everybody right and you you wouldn't even think of swearing or think of saying something on the borderline of swearing because she's not say and you're but you would not want to hurt the law you had it not in you but then over time something got you so mad that you said that and then all of a sudden you found yourself saying that more and it was easy not so hard even though you know it's wrong it becomes easier to do it because why the conscience is seared now that's on an individual level and I believe that the God the Great Physician and if you just surrender yourself like you would to a doctor on an operating table under anesthetic if you'll just let the Lord come to you tonight this morning let him come and operate if anything you know I'm not trying to preach Daniel home or preach down in your mind or anything I'm just preaching about the little puts on my heart but if something strikes and you say yes I'm actually there that's what I need I want to I want God to renew my conscience yeah because you see and this is why I'm saying this this is the only reason why I'm saying this when the Prophet was over there in glory land hallelujah the voice of God see damn this is perfect love no cause he prophesies I don't understand this so good and the voice said this is the Holy Ghost that you preach perfect love and this is what this is really kind of this is this is why I'm saying all this because if the Holy Ghost is perfect love and I want to put a differentiation here or let's just discuss this the subject of being sealed with the Holy Ghost right you're sealed with the Holy Ghost it means you're sealed and nothing can take you out but you can be sealed and he can be grieved so this is a category that many of us find ourselves in and and and on an individual level and you know a church level many times churches can be in that condition with the Holy Ghost is grieved so much with most of the congregation all the time because why the conscience has have been seared but I believe this morning healing can take place I believe this morning if you just ask the Lord to renew and you a godly conscience to bring you back to refresh you so that your life hallelujah that your life can refrain from grieving the spirit that sealed you so the perfect love that the prophet went into becomes more and more every day more and more now I'm preaching to myself more than you I believe because you know now I'm not saying but I am saying I have a very high-pressure job in it and it does make me angry and so I do and this is a confession time I do grieve the Holy Spirit I do I do I say things and I get mad and I'm and I'm definitely praying about all the time lord help me Lord I want to be in I want to be like Daniel I want to be like Daniel in the middle of Mystery Babylon that even the enemy has to say he's got a spirit and the Spirit of God is in him who and that's in the Old Testament how this man however God made him he painted those chromosomes in such a way that he could live excellent now Beck's in the Old Testament now what about now right now here 120 something manuka street sorry folks Valley Road look Georgia Street so right here right here don't even know but right here we can walk with a conscience that's so it's like I'm seared to say lord please just get a nice hand of the divine supposition and scrape off the crust scrape off the crust Lord reveal its rawness again where I couldn't even hurt you because I believe I believe he can do it now I know personally right I know personally how hard you know I always thought if I see my conscience then I'll just pray and it'll come straight back no it does not come straight back oh the Lord can do it but sometimes he wants you to reap what you sow so if you start sowing something that's you know you start telling little Porky's start telling you no and it's very hard in business not to tell Porky's I tell you when people want to hear something and you really keep you you you you're in the sticky situation where if you tell them this and that's the truth you're gonna lose the contract you're gonna have a very angry client and then all these other things are going to happen or you can say something that's just a little twist just a little twist you do that all of a sudden it becomes easier the next time all of a sudden it's easy to just tell lies where's the Holy Ghost where's where's that divine love he's waiting he's up on the perch where's your experience your experiences in if you're sealed is in the sealed category yet without the experience others perfect love just one this is how the Lord's blood so powerful if you really just lay everything down just get down on your knees and say Lord and I don't want to do that anymore I really don't Lord Jesus do whatever it takes and stay there until he comes you know we too often get down and ask God for something and then get up and carry on and nothing's happened you know because we're just so busy and so pressured just if you're gonna ask the Lord for something you know like that I think that's an important thing to ask for you know there's different levels of in praise right this is a very special one I believe this is a very powerful one you kneel down and and whatever you need to do and you just open with the Lord you know and and and you wait and ask the Lord to come and heal you and then he'll come and heal you and renew that conscience back because you see it so I'm you know I'm just kind of preaching my own testimony here you know these things is all the stuff that I've kind of gone through and going through but I believe that if we can be sealed with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is not up on the perch all the time waiting just say come on come on you know these things you know the things that I do they're very easy not to do it's very easy not to lie it's very easy not to take them drive it's very easy not to talk on your phone and drive I got hands-free now it's very easy to stop swearing right it's very easy these are not things that you're addicted to or anything like that but it's also very easy to do them so you're in this kind of death and life scenario or should I say experiencing love and not experiencing as love scenario because the more you grieve him and you walk your walk in your life and and is grieved how are we going to taste of that heavenly place because I truly believe that that place that the Prophet got taken which you know is the Holy Ghost you can have more of him you can have more of the Holy Ghost this is your joy this is your inheritance you can have it more of him and all of the stickers in your life you know they they the prophets it's that when there's more water coming in you know they unfold and two leaves and then in the service you go like this you know you know people that's doing listen the service genuinely doing this in the service I see it as like the leaves are just out in this Aang Lord shine on me Lord shine on me Lord let me photosynthesize your life your life amen now I don't have to explain that remember I preached it already so you understand let me photosynthesize your light I'm worshiping but if you like this don't crunched up in me you know how can you photosynthesize my you know now to tie this because you see here is the scripture isaiah 43:2 5 it says that what John the Baptist will do but the Lord tired our prophets message straight into it on the rahowa River he said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming so send I you with a message to forerunner second coming amen I seen you so he's tying the same power the same the same accomplishment but on a spiritual level on a global level and now we cannot look at that now listen as global but now you are an earth in your own right you so don't just think of this big broad thing and all the body and everything doing that but now it's on an individual level as well you are made out of the same earth that the earth was made out of amen yes amen and you are redeemed just like the earth has redeemed water blood spirit and the in glorification amen perfect love was introduced under Elijah's ministry you do realize that the purpose that the path gets made straight and the the hell's of the mess become level as to so that you can see perfect love so the perfect love can be revealed to you now if this is the purpose of Elijah's ministry is to introduce perfect love what is perfect love do amen now I don't need to preach this because being just preached it and this is how the Lord works and I'm you know and it was all in there but I don't have to preach it now but that mighty angel that came down with the open book on Mount Sunset the angel that came to Gideon when Gideon was in his lack of identity that angel came you know and Gideon he's yesterday angel he's all the miracles and if I could just open up that conversation you know let's just hypothesize it the angels is Gideon I've come this is where all the miracles are I'll tell you where the miracles are I've come to take away your fear so that faith can operate again so that miracles can happen again theaters the angel comes and says what fear not angelic visitations come to remove the fear because the enemy puts fear all over the church when the Prophet came the Pentecostal church was covered in fear human fear scared when we came out of the nomination our world was full of fear scared of things scared of being rejected scared of being thus scared of being made fun of scared of being rejected scared of being refused scared of venturing out scared of change i rebuked that because the Angels never Amen what did he come for if you can recognize this if you're scared of anything the angel needs to come to you let him come the Prophet says let him come let that lamb come and take the book hallelujah let that mighty angel to sit down into lives lead him to sit down unto you let him come down say Lord you know all of these anxieties and fears and unshare --'tis Oh Lord let your brazen feet to sin down let that angel compass at me to take away the fear fear not fear not little flock don't be scared the Lord has ordered everything he's got a race set before you all of its planned out just what with him when things come up in the church what with God amen when your neighbors start to do something wrong what was God when they try and take your land what was God when when your friends reject you what was God when you fail and fall on your face what was God when all the enemies come at you in every direction just walk with God because he is here Elijah's ministry introduced this angel integers perfectly to cast out fit and if you fear you're not made perfect and loved I'm sorry to say that but I'm not sorry because you need a hearing if you're fearful you're not made perfect in love now I don't mean you're not sealed I mean there is something that's coming to interfere with there because when you're perfect of love there is no fear what's on the pitch the Holy Ghost what does the Holy Ghost revelation Teen one revelation Teen one is the Holy Spirit right that's him that's the person you can't separate the Holy Spirit from Jesus from the mighty angel he is the same person and you are the earth you had a randon the sea that he comes down to it came to Gideon and stood in front of him he comes to you inside you to stand in you hello you came to Daniel and said Daniel I've been sent from the presence of a mighty God to tell you you loved greatly beloved you know the angel he sees you you or your greatly beloved I've come to give you skill and understanding and then they heard a man's voice that says make him understand the vision and today I pray that the Lord makes you understand this vision make you understand make you understand the season that we're living in make you understand why you're going through what you're going through and how you're now able to share how you feel safe to share your family secrets with your pastor to share your family secrets that have held your family down in a curse all those things to share them because of love because love because of a season you cannot be raptured with those things that's why this is happening that's why you're failing that's why you're falling down that's why these things are coming up that's why the enemy's under tributed now manifesting the HIDs in your life because the environments right love is here Elijah's ministry finally after 50 years is finally coming into its place finally starting to all all the mechanics are coming out now the dynamics can really fly we tried before us try to make things happen try to enforce an image try and make the people message believers like an army like a military enforce all the children to be something make them into a certain image and even make the adults in the performing and the stickers come out and the Holy Ghost is on the perch watching a sealed people live under their privilege not experiencing perfect wondering why there's no miracles wondering why there's no supernatural happening and just every now and again someone breaks through turning it into a big formal military parade but then finally after many years and this is exactly how it has to happen it has to happen this way because it happened that way to Israel it happened that way and every type and shadow there's always a death burial and resurrection of a move of a revival the seed must be given buried raised again on a dispensation and then in your life the seed must be given received by faith bury die and then come back up in a resurrection there's a seven church age and every generation there's seven church ages and every individuals life you go through and that's the time where we you know in perfect love all those things it's - it's a purging it's to remove the enemies to clear the battlefield to lead a largest ministry hallelujah you know we read how much time we got we read and Zechariah chapter four and this is big for me this is really big we're sitting here right and particularly me all the time we're sitting here and we're watching the ministry and we're a joy sing but are we impressed to the level that God you know because God's expressing something he is expressing divine love he's expressing redeeming power he's worse expressing grace he's expressing the love secrets to his bride he's expressing identity he's expressing everything that's in heaven like he did with Moses and all the stuff and they made it on the earth he's expressing it all to a people now we're looking for something so great we're looking for the entire move and the great move and the third pole and the squeeze to be this big great thing don't be a Pharisee don't be a said you see cuz otherwise you'll be sad you see sorry I had to do don't do that don't do it God hides and simplicity if we headed simplicity down in the seals but my sublime acted Scripture any hidden simplicity then after the message and after the church after the redeemed that came out under the message have gone under and come back up again and revival it will still be in simplicity so don't miss it this is your opportunity here some of the greatest of its ever to transpire some of the greatest grace did he ever come to the church is here right now for you to go on an adventure who's ready for an adventure you are going to be translated soon I can't think of a better adventure than translation oh my what's better than translation amen the greatest things to prepare us the greatest nutrition environments to come over there to come to you here and your Bible studies when you're listening to messages if you're engaged and the Holy Ghost is not on the perch but you you're walking with them because this don't leave this service will the seared conscience I challenge you all of you everyone in this room don't leave this service with a seared conscience now I know I'm not saying all come up here and cry you can do whatever you like it doesn't need a heaven like there it just needs to be faith and say Lord I have I've been hurt I've been let down and it's and then I've gone and as a defense mechanism I've gone and done that well this person's done this to me therefore to to try and get revenge I've gone and said that and what would it happen you see it your conscience a little bit and then because it would see a little bit worse and worse and worse than and now its proportion now it's like a steak that's been seared on the bride for two hours you know that can happen and then it's easy and you can be sealed and you know the Prophet said that you can be sealed and even go insane you can go insane why because of little things little foxes spoil the vine I'm doing a part two of this and we'll go more into that on I think it's Wednesday week little you are he is the vine and you other branches right so you connect it on your ceiling now there's meat to be fruit beer but then these little foxes come in and they eat the buds and they and they cause things to stop fruiting so there needs to be and I believe there needs to be an environment where all of us have been impacted by what's happening in simplicity cuz it's so simple and so humble and it's so powerful is what's happening right now I can't you just have to ask the Lord to reveal this to you and I pray the Lord does what is really going on here like I said he's bringing them valleys up and the mountains down he the mountaintops right the mountaintops is those great times where it's so wonderful in you're on cloud nine right perfect love first love right first love the valleys is where you're tried and the fruit is born and you're going through it all what would happen if you had at all the former latter rain forming together an environment where you can be in such a good place in your spirit and yet you're going through a trial and you can handle that trial you can conduct yourself with joy and you can share and you're not ashamed to share the deepest horriblest evil of secrets of your life the things that happen to you maybe you were molested or something like that as a child and you too scared to tell anybody you don't want to share what the pastor you don't want to get counseling for all those things now that's an extreme example I'm trying to say there's all like there is every scale of it things that could happen and you know the Lord reminds you and you say Lord why am i struggling and then that comes back and then that comes back and then that miracles about you you say I can't you that's too embarrassing but what if love was so strong and so powerful that you've of Liberty to share their and I don't mean stand up here and share it because some things are sensitive but I'm talking about maybe with a sister a brother with the pastor you know for pre have to talk to to to work to get close once your chase a thousand into ten thousand right so in that connection and when the lovers so there and you're the valley that you're going through and that first love is and you're all there in one experience I believe that as a need in it condition I believe that's a need inner condition these things was really unfolding and opening and I'll share testimony so I was praying with Brahman one night and I always pray quite long sometimes at night and brahmam ended up sleeping because I prayed too long so I think it was quite late it was midnight or so so I'm praying Brahm and prayed first and then I'm praying and as I'm praying and we're praying for people and you'll be surprised you know like I think right this is what I think you might be different but I think how people don't know the things I'm struggling with but you know they actually do people can see people can see your faults more than you can and it's the same for me to you you know and I see things and I'm not gonna go up and go oh you're this you're this you've got this you've done this you need to do this injustice this is unless and give them a big prescription and yet the Lord wasn't even wanting you to he was actually going to do something else to remove it so you interfering with the program of God but I know I can see things right and I see what people struggling with and they say things little things and they give hints or and you see it you can't not see it you know I'm not gonna ignore it because I care I care so and I'm only you get burden for the people and your burden for something that someone's going through and you want them to get in it and I was praying in Brahman I we were praying real seriously for some situations for people now you this is the thing and I preached this years ago you can see something in someone and never tell them about it and pray them through it and they never even knew they had it and they and it's gone why do they need to know sometimes they don't the Lord works in any way he wants to sometimes he wants them to know and and and deal with it that way sometimes you can see a trait and then you pray and then the Lord shows them sometimes you see something and you pray through for somebody and it's gone and they never even knew it praise our Lord for the body of Christ white blood cells coming in destroying the little scabs and enemies right okay so so we're praying and burden for situations and then you know like something happens for me when the Lord comes close it's like you see more your discernment goes up another notch or 20 notches or whatever you see things right and then it's like wow it's kind of like the Lord's burden right here's my little burden for a couple of situations and how it's affecting things and I'm praying and asking the Lord to do and then he comes down and it's like whoa and he kind of gives you a taste of the bigger picture and you go wow man this is and next witness the valleys and the mountains thing came I was like because I was like you're dealing and it's a piece of powerful season that we're in right now where where he will do though he will bring those things together and the former letter rain falling at the same time we coming back to our first love right now coming back and going through trials of the hardest type now I don't mean the big blocks being chipped away I'm talking about the finer egg on your image and he's polishing and it's those little polishing things that can be the most embarrassing little niggly foxes that are spoiling your vine that a holding of subconscious back from rapturing faith being to be expressed because rationing faith has been you if you're sealed rapturing faith is in you and the seed of your predestined seed it's in there but it just gets limited it gets held back by the little foxes and so I'm and I didn't know Brahman was asleep I thought you see we're just praying you know we're kneeled over we're praying I might kneel down on the floor and she's like crouched over on the bed but she's now gone sleeping and I'm now like telling her all about it and I'm like wow this is what's gonna happen like this is what we're coming into becoming the Lord's going to level it out he's gonna make the crooked path straight he's good the that what he promised to do through Elijah's ministry is fully gonna manifest in that church and we're gonna have that and I said and in all of this the trials that we go through gonna be so hard and yet we're on the mountain at the same time and we're gonna have perfect love in the trial divine love for each other because it says that every joint supply of them effectually works together in love so here comes the next the pinnacle of the objective of the gospel that's to bring that body into perfection together where there's nothing to handle no sticker in the church no critical nothing no jealousy because perfect love casts out all fear and it's fear that makes the stickers because it's a defense mechanism to push back because there's stuff going on inside just keep them on so you you know that's all they all gets eradicated because of the first love because their conscience no only got this this morning about the conscience that I'm saying Lord I'm just waiting before a man in that came speak about the conscience because it's the conscience there once that gets completely renewed into a godly condition then the Holy Ghost comes down and you as an individual start to what happened to the rod when he got into the Shekinah what happened man he turned back into his original condition that rod had been beaten scraped turned completely tree of knowledge a sized that had been man knowledged and used by men to hit man and judge and whatever right and all of a sudden he goes into the Lord's presence and he's now back to his original condition and the reason why the rod turned back into the original condition it's because it was a tree to begin with now when you get put into that same present and I mean sealed and and fellowship claimed it resist the devil he will come to you and he's coming at you right now many people right now he's already trying to attack you right now especially the young people they haven't got the whole negotiate man he's going at you hard to try and keep you from the Holy Ghost but all you young people can hit the Holy Ghost today just surrender all and say Lord I'm ready don't forgive me how I lay it all down and I want the Holy Ghost and then resist the devil again keep resisting her resist them don't lick him when he got pissed at you push push push push it's a power of suggestion he's a clever marketer and sell a market stuff they put it on billboards everywhere suggesting to you and after at first you think all this junk then after a while hey why don't I just try that you know why not try that McDonald's cheeseburger such clever marketing you know you look at that thing with all the sauce and the onions and the mustard and the cheese and you're like I remember you I remember that flavor and it dates back to when I was a child and I had all these memories associated with happy hamburger with cages and all its clever devil style that's what the devil does with his peace during his lives he's lying to you he always lies and he's just he just pissed it and pushes and pushes until you either just keep resisting and rebuke him and whatever you need kick him remember how God went down there and he gave him a kick so you need to get down and give him a kick too give him a kick kick him down kick him down have the devil on the run a son of God must not be trodden down so kick that mamba down kick him down kick him down have the devil on the run a son of God must not be trodden down so kick that Mamba down kick him down you know the Lord said to the property said if you just be more sincere you can you can rebuke the member and he's the head demon and all that Sundaram is under your feet and feet it not undefeated but under feet it he's been under feeted I liked it that's out that's for US aid that's for us under feeted keep him there he'll try and get it out lots of Lies come from the ground a they come up they waft up like a bad smell there's waft lies just don't just resist that just think of the love that you felt when you first became aware of your soulmate think of the butterflies think of not even hungry anymore you're not hungry for food because you have food that the world knows not over it's a love so strong that your effort type disappears a connection to the divine where energy doesn't deplete think of that you think of that love that you felt when you first had eyes well that one that you knew this is Maya this is this is my this is my that's my wife that's my husband you know that feeling when when the first you know that first what does that expression of interest was made and that feeling that you got that the butterflies and you were just so enthralled you were so moved you couldn't think anything else you were just so infected that is your first love how you began to have feelings beyond friends how it was when you shook their hand how they consumed your faults how you couldn't wait to see them the intense butterflies with them when you held their hand for the first time just remember those time so remember it think about it think about that feeling you know that that really that that is a taste because marriage is a the Lord is expressing something there he this union between husband and wife that feeling that you got and I trust that you still get you know obviously this seasons but you should put that love that first love you can have that you can keep that you have to work on this a relationship but takes work so just think now there's nothing like that first cloud9 we call it who knows cloud 9 who's heard of cloud 9 before right cloud 9 you know you all your friends are like going with what's happened to the sky what's happened to this go man sees just off the scene when they disappeared they're not coming to anything anymore if they are they just absent-minded to care their their mind is just full cuz it prisons but their mind got their heart got their body the Lord wants your body he wants your chemicals he wants the chemicals in your body to love him is it too much is that too much he wants the glands that produce the chemicals that make you feel happy he wants those glands he wants you to be so in love with him that your subconscious when you think about him produces dopamine produces serotonin hopefully there's not this is not too much for some people the children let's just call them happy chemicals and even you get so excited when you when you hear the service when you hear the preacher that is adrenaline running when you hear about rebuking the devil when you hear about your victory this adrenaline hallelujah because you're experiencing it not just in your intellect because if you just how did you feel how did you feel brothers when you worked up the courage to ask for her hand in marriage my sisters when your husband Nelson proposed how did you feel what was it feeling um just think about that your life was consumed with love sick as the Song of Solomon says you love so much that you would feel nauseous with love you were incapacitated just so thrilled the epitome of human emotion the epitome of human emotion think about it how about when they walked up the aisle at the wedding ceremony and that union was about to take place and it was all gonna cut you know just come together climb climatized the the the climax of that union the climax of all of the courtship and all of those butterflies and all of those feelings would be consummated and be joined spiritually and soul join and that feeling and that experience I believe with all my heart believing now that that is just a natural type of what we are going into just relive those memories relive those feelings if you can if you can remember what it was like if you can remember that the intense love we now that is for us in the Lord that love don't rest now rest but don't rest last night everything everything until you have that for the Lord because that that there is perfect love as it comes your soul spirit body mind and strength all consumed and as love don't leave the service with a seared conscience but little or deal with you and your seat let the Lord deal with you where you're at and say Lord there's anything that you know that you've done or that you do because of a seared conscience and that's keeping him keeping him up on that perch call him down say Lord I don't want to look at you through a lettuce anymore I don't just want to see you afar off I don't want to only just have tastes of you when is a collective energy a collective experience the Lord I want you in my home I want you in my in my office I want you in my car I want you when I walk out that door and all the pressures of the world come on me I want you when I'm walking in the mall and these Andrus females everywhere I want you when my partner sees that McNasty to me and it hurts so much I want you then I want to walk with you because perfect love is what turn sticks into trees that perfect love is what restores everything that perfect love the prophecy lay aside everything until you have it it's time for this love that you had to become a normal with the bridegroom it's time this is the hour where that love can be manifested in this environment now if you don't have that this is your moment this is your time to lay hold of it and say Lord I want that with all my heart whatever it takes Lord just give it to me Lord if there's anything in my life hindering the flow of that love if there's anything that I'm doing if my conscience has been seared Lord renew it now Lord I lay it all down I'm sick of being like this I'm sick of making those same mistakes over and over again I'm sick of going around Mount Seir over and over again it's time to turn northward it's time to cross over it's time to be delivered it's time it's time no more for those things it's time no more for us the it conscience it's time no more for stickers and time no more to criticisms it's time no more for unbelief it's time no more to sit in a Pew and not give your life to the Lord but this is your moment this is your hour for you to come into perfect love perfect love lay aside everything lay aside your games lay aside human foolishness lay aside humanistic things lay aside military ways of doing things lay aside the laws and let him write the laws in you let him put an image let him pitch it let him pitch his law with the finger of God on the table of your heart that's where that's how it gets not enforcing it from a legal perspective but here I Lord let your love come down and mercy take your finger that you wrote up the Ten Commandments with write it in here they be written in the revelation of my heart that's when you need no forcing to do nothing it's been its season 1 John 5 has Commandments and not Grievous but they you love them you love his laws you love them not because you have to do them because you just love to do them you love to be like him hallelujah just let conscience be renewed this morning they don't be renewed this morning all of us we all have the same or similar battles the Bible says that think not that you're the only one going through these things you know the devil likes to isolate us to our own thing and feel like we're the only one but really we're all going through it we're all having a hard time but just remember you watch what happens now and what's going on right now as you you know you lower increase your expectation but lower the expectation how you think it's going to be because great things are happening right now but it may not be the way that we think and our humanistic you know we've learned logic from school and where and how what the devil calls great in the world calls great we cannot mix that into what we think when the great things the Lord promises because the laws promised great things for us and happening they're happening uh they're happening in our midst some of the greatest things but men of you know the brother Brown said when the lamb stepped forward to take the book right he said that's the most sublime act in scripture that happened envision an eternity right look that looks like one event taking place but it's actually it's a dispensation it's a being coming to redeem as people and it's been happening for fifty years one by one little by little I'm taking them and then little by little I'm giving it to them you know he takes individual it takes them takes their book I mean little by little he says to you I'm gonna give you a little bit of time and as you get maturity as you can till the soil as you can take control as I can trust you to speak bridled um I'm not even gonna go down that route now that the bridal tongue this time can cause a lot of trouble it gets me in a lot of trouble I tell you that for free a lot of trouble but the Lord helped me the Lord helped all of us were then I believe that you know it's one of the final frontiers as this time because if you think about it the Lord wants to use that to create worlds he wants to use that town to speak all these things now how can he trust that if it's little efforts loose huh how can he trust that if it was not completely in perfect love therefore he holds that power back you watch when all the squeeze come along all that it's all timed because you will be walking in perfect love you would have laid aside everything until perfect love love worketh no ill to his neighbor he can trust it he can trust that mouth to speak maybe we'll hit that next time I want to read something prophecies we must approach God through that channel of love and faith faith listen to us now really get this this is amazing this is the first time I've seen this and comprehended it to the level that Lord showed me but we must approach God through that channel of love and faith faith takes us to the channel right love is the one that takes us in faith takes us to the channel to the sauce and love takes us oh man just chew on that a little bit chew on that faith takes us to the channel and then love takes us in man works powerfully and love worketh faith so it's all a cycle right see it here I'm gonna read this to you where's sorry any more clothes prophesies here now think of these mountains and valleys being leveled together in perfect love so this is an environment now where you can be free now the devil will you'll still have a resistance he does not want you to share your heart with someone else so they can pray for you he does not want you to confess your faults to one another and pray for each other because he knows the fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much he knows that and he will do everything in his lying power to stop the communication but let the communication of your faith work let it express and just feel free if you feel like you need to share something with someone go to them and talk with them they're not going to make fun of you they're not going to mock you they're not going to hurt you they gonna love you and care for you and pray for you the Lord will lead you but this isn't a season that these things need to happen if we're to if we if we are to to come into that position where there's the devil cannot be hidden you think why the valley of megiddo why this plain where there's no hills and valleys err there's one little mound they call it tel megiddo and it's a little hill but that hill is a man-made it's not God made did you know that she's a little hill on and Megiddo Valley it's made by men because it was a it was a very powerful military route between Egypt and Assyria and so many many people and civilizations conquered and then conquered it and as they conquered it where they built their fortresses were just turned into a mound and they've cut into it and they've seen it's actually like 27 different civilizations on top of each other ruins you know because they burn it down every time and then they rebuild and burn it down and rebuilding that's turned into a little hill it's a man-made hill don't have a tel megiddo in your battlefield the Lord wants to level it down so the devil has nowhere to hide hallelujah don't give him any when I don't be his defense because you're fearful or scared to share things now I'm not saying make a an absolute like I must gonna share you know don't do that let's just doing it again in your own ability but actually just to be realize that you are free now that this I am in this too I struggle sometimes to share things and open up to people really because of a private upbringing your head you wouldn't believe it but but anyway so you are free to do it we love each other we care for each other we can talk to each other we can share with each other we can pray for each other and we do and and I've seen over the years those that are able to do it get free a lot quicker than those that closed off and their skid in they scared of rejection or and it's not even up here because we know and we're taught that we could love each other and and we can share we can to confess our faults to each other and pray for each other but that's down here there's the problem it's down here that's been rejected by school friends and the young age because you see it's something silly or you opened up too much you know you know how you get those children and they're so innocent and they just tell you everything and they share everything and all that they're going through and everything and there's no filter right and you think all what are they gonna say you know they start talking and your friends around and it's like well here comes here come here comes all the family secrets well there's children right innocency and in their child one day they say that and they're at school or in a group environment at work and they say something in it they get shot down or laughed at then what happens as they clam up no never without the Lord's help well some sort of counseling to boss it open or Semitism or something like that it will it will stay there and they'll never be able to communicate on the same level again of innocency but in the Garden of Eden we have innocency and the Garden of Eden we as just as little children this is this happy it and malice right be as little children these little children be innocent in those things realize that we are coming back we're not a stagnant church that just gets to a certain level and when we know everything and we've got faith and we're going to get raptured but actually we're coming into an innocency but yet with revelation and with the knowledge of good and evil yet innocency yet we love each other yet there's no speakers yet there's no hatred yet there's no malice yet there's a freedom there's a liberty to share to open up and I encourage you there are some things that you need to talk about with people and if someone comes to you and says something never give them the devil any rope to make that person climb up again just listen understand understand love pray it's the only thing we can do in some conditions you might be told something that makes you feel hurt pray together this is what it's all about there's a Liberty that we have and we're coming further into that Liberty you know and right now if the devil's telling you I can't never do that it just means that he's really trying because he knows that the fervent and effectual prayer of a righteous availeth much I'm gonna read an interpretation of tongues from the smyrnaeans age but first I just want to read this quote and then we'll close this is here I am more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter that place there was no jealousy he's talking about when he got translated into heaven he goes there was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only supreme beauty and joy whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even every enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the Lightning is flashing or the guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter get perfect love now remember this is the profit now and he would have known his ministry was introducing perfect love and you Ness was just before the seals was preached so the enormity of that was probably not even revealed to him at that stage but you know who here is the one that the Lord used to to introduce perfect love and now here we are with the greatness revelation that's ever struck the earth the full book is open and an inheritance has bequeathed it's been given and we are in a position now where we not of what we say but what we do and what we live to anoint that that being that person that perfect love himself you see because God the people that walk with God right they annoyed God their life anoints him your anointing with worship you anoint him with praise you anoint him with holiness you anoint him now God reveals himself differently to every generation yet similarly right he does this Annette 1 and he'll reveal abut he'll reveal the war part of himself to that generation back in Israel he will reveal the love part he revealed us but now I shouldn't I said loved before because now as the capstone he reveals the capstone which is the very love of God and it's full measure that is what your life our life is anointing if we try and anoint the knowledge of God remember that the prophets said how the body is being developed from the feet the apostolic stride up through the chest through the arms to the mouth when all the tongues and interpretations and prophesy and then the Prophet came with the Eagle Age up until the eyes to see further and then he sealer to come up into the divine intelligence right now as those ages the people that was caught up in the vision that listen to their star of their agent listen to their messenger they anointed not by this only not by these only not by their feet only but their whole life was lived out to anoint get revelation to anoint that divine expression of God now whether they knew what exactly but we do we know what that what characteristic we are anointing the fullness of God kept therefore if we just try and anoint an epistolary age or anoint the supernatural or anoint just portions of his revelation will be still well we will be deficient and out what we're anointing but if we realize that the capstone has come and the perfect love is here anything in your life anything that's resisting Homer don't leave this church don't leave the service with that don't leave the service with a seared conscience because you need that Holy Ghost either to seal you if you're not all you need the Holy Ghost if you're sealed to come fellowship with you because that perfect love so that your life can anoint them it's a it's like a snowball of glory I like them once it starts rolling it gets better and better and better alright but until it does it's like man you're just sitting there and it's how you can't living under Assiut conscious living under some sort of fear like gideon within that angel comes and i pray that he comes like he came to Peter in the prison maybe you're in a little prison right now and your conscience has been seared and it's been hard for you and you've struggled with this one little thing your conscience be see it may that angel come to your pew now and sit there and strike you on the side and you and say stand up Peter stand up out of your conscience seared present stand up home ah stand up and watch the chains fall off stand up and watch the prison doors open Peter stand up and watch your liberty as you walk into it walk into your Liberty hallelujah walkin and walk out amen walk out of it just keep walking walking with God if I had a thousand tongues if the Prophet said to express this may the Lord reveal it I'm just expressing this by the Lord's grace if you are not saved accept Jesus Christ as your Savior now if you have not been baptized in water be baptized now be baptized now don't wait don't wait there is nothing to wait for but give it now because there's everything to give for he wants to trade your broken down messed up emotional in turmoil life that's ruined and can only go to hell he wants to trade that for a life full of love peace faith joy eternal life rapture unity fun glories he wants to trade you who's who loves that trade I think that's a very unfair trade but I thank the Lord for His grace her by while we were in soon as he came that life for us and then he said even when you still sanae's it head mine have my book of life have my record he wants to give you his record he doesn't want it to eat it you cannot appear before him with your record or your works you cannot but he wants to give you this alleluiah be baptized now if you have not received the baptism in the Holy Spirit receive it now anyone on that camera receive it now why not me why not now why not why not anyone sitting in these seats why not now take the Lord he wants to trade you your life for his your ruins like that hill on Megiddo he wants to give you his life that was given on the hill of Mount Calvary he wanna trade somebody's gonna trade it's not me by the way it's just inspiration I had no plans to say any of that but the Lord is gracious the Lord is merciful the Lord is working hallelujah you know how much resistance has been to get this across man and not and you know it makes a minister really pray Lord are you trying to do this or resist the devil you got to know this you got to know where you stand you've got to know and say Lord and you get in and then the thought comes if the Lord gives something that devil does not like he'll resist everything you always have been saying all Wednesdays in Sunday's always crazy the night before day before whatever because this is this male to be delivered and the devil does not want their mail and the devil does not want to be exposed and today as an exposure this is an expose but welcome to the it's bow of Satan he is exposed as a defeated broken back being a tool in the hands of God on a leash and he's about to go to the lake of fire now he wants to take as many people with him don't let him resistant he's screaming out don't listen to the lives it's all lies of the devil roll away the stone and let the resurrection and the life speaks and call you out of your tomb call you out roll away the stone roll it away let nothing interfere with that direct amen roll it away if you have not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit receive it now press on to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time the Holy Ghost is the earnest of our inheritance therefore the Holy Ghost that he got to me brother bear have got taken and he got plunged and you could say immersed and the fullness of what we're preaching right now the Spirit of God and you get tasted we go to Kemp and we get caught up into heaven because the minister says let's go to heaven and then the presence proceeds the glory precedes the person and we feel that presence right why can't you have in your life don't leave the service with a seared conscience don't leave with a said conscience but let God God scrape off the crust let God restore you let God fill you with the Holy Ghost let God heal your heart let god take you and hold you and mess out your heart right now let God pull you to himself but look at him through a letter anymore don't look at God from a distance anymore don't live your life sealed by the Spirit and yet not in fellowship don't you don't have to it's easy not to but it's easy to you have a choice now what gives you the ability to come neutral it's that your conscience gets renewed and and I pray Lord every day we're not every day but any time it comes on my mind which is a lot Lord renew me Accord the conscience let it hurt me to hurt you Lord don't let me become callous don't let me be cut though let it never be easy to grieve the spirit of God cuz he's like a dove even the slightest little white lie who told that story how the prophet they went through and they had a sandwich or something at a better and I one of you know the border of Canada and America or somewhere they had a sandwich you know Ladin and they were almost home or somewhere miles away and then he remembered I pulled I bought a sandwich through customs and doesn't tell them see Bowie we're going back and they drove for hours went back there and gave them the sandwich now that is an unsaid conscience now we wonder why where's all the miracles Gideon do you want miracles and I'm not talking about just a miracle gospel but I mean do you want the supernatural element of the Shekinah glory in your life do you want rapture in faith manifested in its fullness in your life and don't leave the service with the seed conscience a man can up the musicians please quickly created me a clean heart Oh God and as you as we sing us just pray it pray it before the Lord created me a clean heart give me a clear conscience renew and me a right spirit hallelujah while the music's playing softly let me read this tongues and interpretation sorry for keeping you so long but the burden has been delivered the very thought by the Lord's grace it's now in your hands what shall we what will you do with this Jesus called Christ who is this Melchizedek the mighty God unveiled before you what will you do with this Jesus that is called Christ right now the judgment begins at the house of God right here your you can choose now will you let him extend his scepter toward you and grant you to be a co here with him until half the kingdom will you allow him to do that as a divine judge who can judge grace mercy or damnation right now is the time to make a decision because he has judged the lamb faithful he has judged the lamb and written the Lamb's Book of Life perfect and you are often that book right now you offered a perfect record you are offered a perfect life lived on your behalf take it take it I encourage you take that life now because one day the opportunity will not be there and the same judge that can judge you perfect now will judge you condemnation this is what the this is the interpretation of tone from the Simonian church age now the Lord through the church age sermons gave instructions on how that we is the believers of this message to overcome and little by little he unfolded all these things that we should do that would ensure successful walk he says here I say unto thee my people this night that as I have spoken again this morning unto thee thou must search thy heart there must recognize me this morning for I come into thy midst to bring these tidings not to frighten me for I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I walk among thieves estate I relieve this is for us now I believe that he is the I am and he says these things for his bride I say unto thee my people that thou should persevere and faith that thou should lay aside these frenzies and these dealings for personal affections that thou should sit thou at upon by God and first love think about that first love that you had when you first met your partner you first met your husband your wife and how it consumed you the Lord wants that from you and if you want to give a met right now you can ask board clear my conscience I want to be around you more I want to be in your presence day and night I want to live in the Shekinah hallelujah where the Glory's never fail that thou should depart from foolishness that thou should put these human ways away from thee that thou should turn unto my spirits and allow me I like that not try it yourself or you but allow me he says you know when our gentleman says to his wife allow me just think of that right now she's allowed me my lady allowed me come away with me and allow me to work that and allow me to glorify my name through your being the Lord wants to glorify his own name through you I say unto thee this day be zealous and turn from my foolishness cast aside your fear for I am your God that watches over you this night and mine I shall run to and fro as I have spoken so will I perform it even until the end or my that ties that whole thing to me claimant claim it my friends claim it my brother and sister claim it now claim it now this is for you he sang it to you lay aside humanistic things lay aside foolishness lay aside faith lay aside anxiety lay aside all of these things lay aside logic lay aside all the hurts lay aside all the devil's lives lay it all aside lay it aside and let him allow him allow God to come into your life now cuz he will perform it unto the end if he has begun something the scripture says even if it's the tiniest little thing that he's done in your life and you felt a pull one day and you gave something to him he started something and it may be just a tiny thing he says he will what he began he will finish being confident this is Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing that he which begun a good work in you shall continue it until the day of your redemption therefore take heart take courage you may feel like he hasn't done anything in your life a long time that he's forsaken you he has he will complete you he started you he will bring you through he's the author and finisher of your faith therefore look unto me and believe me and repent from thy wickedness and from my unbelief and from thy fears and come unto me and serve me amen a male is stand we're gonna sing created me a clean heart Oh God and we're gonna pray this will all about heart and they were gonna pray and if there's anyone in here and I believe we can all put ourselves in this prayer that our consciences we renewed in the Lord will pour out a spirit of fresh and come back from the perch that we may live in a Shekinah let's sing that song created me a clean heart Oh God [Music] creating ugly Oh [Music] and renew a right spirit within me [Music] me a clean ha [Music] and renew a right spirit within me [Music] cast me not away from my praises [Applause] [Music] oh

the law as we pray we're going to pray together you could pray as well and we're just in simplicity because God listened to the heart well if you mean it then just pray to him now in Assam as we
