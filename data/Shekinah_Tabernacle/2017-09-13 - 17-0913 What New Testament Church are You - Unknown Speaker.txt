Sunday man praise the Lord amen brother Alpha is loved and enjoyed himself as much as we all enjoyed ourselves so Amy as Wonder will see God move and power I have me and praise the Lord let's just go to if you got your Bibles handy let's go to the chapter we've got a Matthew 24 and we're going to read verses 12 down to verse 21 down to verse 22 of Matthew 24 Matthew 24 and verse 12 this isn't because the Nikoli shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then the end shall the in come when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem now stand in the Holy Place whoso readeth let him understand then let him which being Jerusalem flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child and to them which gives suck in those days but pray that ye but pray ye that your flight may not be in the winter neither on the Sabbath day for then shall be Great Tribulation such as such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor a no nor ever shall be and except those days be shortened issue should no flesh be saved before the elects sake those days shall be shortened Amen may the Lord blesses word you may have your seats I want to take a a thought where history repeats itself and we actually find a few if you look into the scripture where you know you see brother Branham he will identify himself as you know we know he's the prophet of you're the spirit of Elijah and he'll go back into the Old Testament and say as just as Jezebel comes into power he comes the prophet Elijah out of the wilderness and he identifies the world you know the the system coming to take power in America is that Catholic system coming in through the election of President Kennedy any identifies things that are going on in the world and it's easy to look back in history and say well that is where that he was back there but we must understand from the scripture where we are today because the message did not come to make us historians only it's good to know what God has done you know in the past and what he's doing but what is he going to do in the future where are we in our journey because we need to know where we are wouldn't you agree we need to know where we are in the scripture in our journey and so I want to take if I can from John the Baptist to the destruction of Jerusalem and that span is the same span that we live today where brother Bram says many times that when when the vine puts forth another branch it will produce a book of Acts when that when the vine he is the vine puts forth a bunch of believers it will produce another book of Acts now many times we think of a book of Acts as signs and miracles and wonders and God's children being led and that's exactly what it is but in the book of Acts there is a birth of a Galatian Church there's a birth of a Corinthian church is a birth of an efficient church at this alone in church all of these churches are birthed and formed when the book of Acts is being written and so if we look into the scripture we can look at the characteristics of these churches and then you can see that believers around the world there are message churches or even people that are identified by those churches amen that's why I think maybe this might help some of us because you look at some people who say why they like this why is this church like this what and we shouldn't compare ourselves with ourselves but it helps us understand where people are because it was in the beginning it will be at the end right so now I want to take because the destruction of Jerusalem we are told by history that no believer was caught in the description when Titus besieged the city and any allowed all the Jews to go in during cause it was during Passover time he allowed them to go on and then he took the city and butchered a whole bunch of them and blood rolled out the streets and he burnt the city burned the temple as Jesus said that not one stone would be laid upon another because they burnt the temple and all the gold ran down into the you know the mortar and everything said to dismantle it and you know there was a great destruction but none of the believers were and were caught in the destruction because that because Titus if you look at history he actually besieged Jerusalem three times the first two times he had to lift the siege and deal with some other threat but the third time he came back and he took the city and destroyed it and so when it happened the first time the believers remember what Jesus said and so they fled so this to me now this is just me and fellowship will just have some fellowship tonight you know to me the destruction of Jerusalem is like the world system you know this world being destroyed in the Great Tribulation but all the believers have fled in a rapture we do not get caught in it hallelujah I mean so so between John the Baptist to the destruction of Jerusalem within that span is the book of Acts and all but and also to have a book of actually must have a Pentecost and in order to have a true Pentecost you've got to have a 4-run account that that introduces the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world so we had that in this generation where where we had a prophet come with the spirit of Elijah he identified the Lamb of God which is the true word I meant the true Word of God is the lamb he I did he he took away all the creeds and dogmas because by believing Creed's and dogmas you make the Word of God now fixed to the people but you know Jesus hid by teaching the commandments and doctrines of men you make the Word of God no effect so if you teach the true Word of God you make the word of effect what is the effect now God Himself comes and dwells in a people I mean all their sins are washed away they get made into his image amen they overcome the enemy they trade on serpents and all the works of Satan they have dominion over them they have dominion over their own flesh hallelujah so you know that is the power of the truth of the work will give you overcoming power I mean the enemy will be under your feet hallelujah we're not a beaten you're a bunch of people but we know who we are I mean but if we can see ourselves in the scripture it gives us I believe faith I mean stabilizes our walk if we can understand where we are and so now so we had a four-runner come and he was baptizing people in the high river and up there the pillar of fire came down as it is John the Baptist first run the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second coming and then it comes down to his ministry the opening of the seals which is more than false writers and tribulation but it's Redemption being revealed it's a lamb stepping forth I trust you see it when you're here the first time I heard the seals I saw horse riders I saw a tribulation I saw you know the souls under the altar eyes but the second time I just saw him hallelujah I saw the lamb stepping forth to claim me hallelujah trust I trust you see beyond symbols and you see the reality of the whole thing and so he says in the seventh seal message he says now I might just be laying a platform for that great weight great one to come and mean with their ambition willing to build kingdoms upon the earth say Here I am but but the great one he's building the platform for as Jesus Christ himself Jesus Christ and word form and so he introduced he pointed us to our bridegroom he introduced us to our bridegroom hallelujah and then now brother Bram says that the end time message releases the Holy Ghost upon the people because the Holy Ghost was bound by superstition tradition and the deductions of men it was bound to the chest or her head had no power to move because the people were believing a lie of man and seed of the true Word of God I mean so by getting rid of the false that's why Sunday God moved I mean that's why yo wherever believers are God comes down it's not a it's not a hit-and-miss affair amen you ought to be thankful for God's restoration in the cell and where God comes in reality where we just don't read the book of Acts and say wasn't that wonderful we say hey that just happened the other day hallelujah to me hallelujah and so now sorry says that the entire message releases the Holy Ghost so we have come back to a true Pentecost amen message wasn't to take us back to Azusa Street there was a restoration of the gifts and we thank God for it I mean but it's true take us back to a true Pentecost where God would dwell and man once again and then what you see in the book of acts of God leading his church it would it would continue that way hallelujah now in the book of Acts we we go to X chapter 19 and I'm just going to skip over Paul's calling because but we understand Paul's calling is exactly like your calling I trust he's come to you he's come to you when you wanted to live some kind of other life he came to you Paul had a life he had his life mapped out I'm a Pharisee of the Pharisees I'm going to climb this ivory tower of religion he had his ideas I'm going to destroy this thing I think God came to him amen and he saw he saw Hawaii Lord I'm Jesus whom you persecute or that really not the I don't know whatever out of him hallelujah I trust he's come to you like that maybe not in a visible light but he's spoken to you and you let and you laid your life down I mean so now he was called down in the book of Acts we have a we have people that have never we have people that preach that Jesus is the Christ from the scripture but they have no idea of what God has done in their day they're still walking in the past and so he comes and he and he finds the paulus and some of them they were they were they were preaching that Jesus was the Christ but they only knew the baptism of John so there are believers that's why people in denomination you know don't don't just don't just right them off there might be some of policies in there who are living by the light of a former age they just maybe haven't heard yet Amen you with me he didn't hear that's amazing because Paul when he found them he goes straight to have you received the Holy Ghost since you've believed as God a living reality more than an anointing but in reality and and then it says in acts 19 and 2 he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they say we we haven't even heard if there is a Holy Ghost and the impulses or what baptize what baptism we baptize with this is a first three and then four and then they said well John's baptism and Paul said no God's moved on you got to go from just being baptized by the forerunner you be baptized in the one who was crucified for you and when they did it says the Holy Ghost fell upon them and they received it like they did in the book of Acts I mean yo yo you're on the day of Pentecost amen so there's people now who are who are walking informal light but they have to come into the present truth that's why Peter said be established in the present truth so we have them now if I don't hit them all you'll see cuz even the Ephesian Church had something against them even though that's the model Church but they had husbands love your wives wives love your husband's you know they got so deepened mysteries and certain things they forgot to have a love family like what church you know lujah amen let's go to the book of let's go to the book of Hebrews we're just gonna he's going to go through a few of them now actually before we go there I want to lay out a principle forgot a Deuteronomy chapter 29 we have a principle here Deuteronomy 29 verses one down to verse four you know God can do incredible things but it doesn't always mean that we catch what he's saying then and there people would sit in Brenham tabernacle and they didn't catch what was going on they were looking for the they're looking for gifts that God was revealing himself in his word brother branham would ask Billy Paul after preaching the future home did you catch it he said yeah dad daddy said did you catch it no they didn't understand what he said he says only years later he begin to understand and it's exactly here like in Deuteronomy 29 and verse 1 these are the words now remember I'll just read it these are the words of the Covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab beside the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb and Moses called unto all Israel and said unto them ye have seen all the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt under Pharaoh and unto all of his servants and unto all his land the great temptations which thine eyes seen the signs and those great miracles but look at this yet the Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day they had been there in Egypt they had seen the plagues I had seen the Passover it walked through the Red Sea there at Sinai they'd been there 40 years in the world of it but they've seen incredible things be it now he says now the Lord is actually showing you what's going on and this is a principle because if we're honest we we don't understand everything that's been revealed you know not one of us could even sit down and touch the sides of what's contained in here you know if you're asked to explain it well we don't fully because it's not fully revealed we could maybe read it or listen to it but to have the river of what it contains we don't have the fullness of it because as we walk with him he reveals himself and first john 1 and 7 it says but as we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another us in God and the blood of Jesus Christ his sake cleanse us from all sin so you must walk with Him in his word in the light as he is in the light and you have fellowship and it reveals himself so we see that today as well people people get an idea that everyone understands has the same amount of revelation everyone else but we are Jesus gave the parable of the wheat and the tares but I believe we're wheat tonight by His grace if you look at a wheat field that doesn't grow all the same you know these some parts of the golden some parts are still green some parts are you know it's like any natural plant that grows at different speeds one plant to another but when the harvest comes it's already so something may not be real to me but it might be real to you you know you might be more mature than I am but at least if there's life I'm growing amen and that's the same with all of us as long as life is there his life amen as we walk with Him we will mature will become more golden and so it's the same thing around the world people are still growing and maturing and the reason that the rapture hasn't gone is one everyone hasn't come in yet into we're not mature whatever God calls maturity now what we have as well if you know if you look at you'd say history as we read that scripture in Deuteronomy you and Ben give a nice to see your heart a perceiver is to heat all this day so that principle is that something may be open to me but something may not be open to someone else or vice-versa so for example if we read the book of Hebrews let's go to Hebrews 6 and 1 now there is two parts - I won't say redemption well there is two parts to redemption but there's two parts to an exodus it's a coming out and these are going in so in the first excess they had to come out of Egypt for their to go into the Promised Land the second Exodus coming out of the out of the law and traditions of man they had to come out then they're to go into Christ and so Paul and it's the same thing in the third Exodus we came out of the world we came out of religions of men wherever we came out of we came out of something but then we couldn't just come out we had to go in right and so it's just it just room history repeats itself so come out of something but we have to go into Christ now the Hebrew church had come out for the head and garden and Hebrew you know the book of Hebrews to me is it's a great book because the Hebrew people as the light was rising to the Gentiles the Gentiles were coming in blindness was falling upon the Hebrews and Paul was standing here during this overlapped time of the Hebrews being blinded for our sakes and the door opening to the Gentiles and he kept contrasting that the blood of Jesus Christ is greater than the blood of bulls and goats that the priesthood of Melchizedek is greater than the priesthood of Aaron he contrasts all the time and he speaks about let us go let us go unto rest you know just like Moses brought the people out of Egypt and they had to enter into the Promised Land and that was there less rest he says let us labor therefore to enter into that rest so it's calling him to leave from one place go to another place even though they believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah and then he says Hebrew six and one he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us let us go unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards God and of the doctrine of baptisms and of the laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the Dead and eternal judgment and this we do if God permit so he's so this - this foundation he's not saying let's throw it away he says let us leave go from us and go to another so let us know the Foundation's been laid but let's build the house a a following me so he's not saying throw it away he says let us go unto perfection or their perfection is maturity let us grow from here and grow to the force of the stature of Christ and now and then you come into this day where some people say just stay with the simple gospel now this may be rather inflamed turi statements if people see this but I trust to hear the whole thing and they take it in the right spirit but you know some people say just stay with the simple gospel a cure X X 2:38 stay with that and one God and water baptism and and dressing right and you know those just stay with the simple gospel but we're not called just to stay with those things we're called to grow from those things we don't neglect those things look they say here you know of repentance from dead works and of faith towards God amen we've all we've all had to come from that stage where it's not our righteousness it's not Arabic it's not what we do amen but it's faith towards God because faith your faith in the word causes it to come to pass in our lives right amen and abduction of baptisms we've all been preaching about baptism them Lord Jesus Christ it's a fundamental because into unit the straight cake Jesus says and that gate Matthew chapter 7 that's STR AIT which is a narrow passage of water he says into unit that gate for Strait is the gate and narrow is the way so repent we baptize them Lord Jesus Christ you enter into the gate you enter through the gate then there's a narrow walk and of laying on of hands that's divine healing will believe that do we know and of the resurrection of the Dead we believe that do we not amen and of eternal judgment these are fundamentals and in the word but he's saying let's go from those things but these people better have been called out for they haven't gone in right so so we have the Hebrews here now let's go to Thessalonians let's go to second Thessalonians I can find it Timothy Thessalonians Timothy Titus actually here there's Colossians there we go I'm glad someone's awake now it's isn't it so the the Thistle oh the the church at Thessalonica they were troubled by things he says in Thessalonians 1 and I make very sick and Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 1 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus and by our gathering together unto Him see they had gathered to him and we've gathered to him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that they should not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition sorry so these people were troubled they are being shaken he's saying don't be troubled by these things saying that the day of Christ is at hand now there's some there's also those in the New Testament that were preaching that the resurrection had already happened and then you come down into this day and there's people that believe that were in the Millennium so we've had the resurrection the righteous already happen ember in the Millennium so what was in the up what was here in the and the epistles has repeated itself we're there people walking around saying the resurrection has already come it's already been done and people hearing them people within the message drum say you know we're in the Millennium what two souls were in a new body and all these different things and the raptures already happened well what is it don't be shaken by it a few if you come across it it's in the scripture it has to be here because it was in the beginning so it will be at the end and these ones were troubled house us you know people saying that they've Christ is happy says no these things have to be first and then it's gonna be here so don't be troubled and you see people get troubled are you following me maybe you're thinking quite deeply they went listening very intently and then now we have let's go to the this is in no particular order but then you have the Corinthian church now the Corinthian church was a very carnal Church but they were believers remember all these people are believers these are all message people right they they were following the message of their day they will believe us so we're not throwing them out they'll be there like we'll be there it's just like the yes just like the Apostle Peter you read about Acts chapter 15 he starts to be influenced by people trying to bring Judaism into Christianity and he began to separate himself from Gentile believers have you read that he has influenced by certain things but then when Paul came along they had fellowship about these things he saw the error of his ways and he went back into the middle again doesn't mean he wasn't a true apostle but we can be influenced by certain things in lean ways that we necessary shouldn't link so now the Corinthian church they were a cattle church they were a liberal Church now we see the cannelli in Corinthians 1 and 11 and to me the book of Corinthians is like the time of Judges every man did that which was right in his own eyes so they and so what does that mean it basically means everything I do is as is God's perfect will and I can do what I want everything that every man does that which is right in his own eyes but that's not true now a season 1st Corinthians 1:11 for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are the house of Chloe that there are contentions among you see now now this I say that every one of you say if I'm of Paul I'm of Apollo's I'm of Cephas I'm of Christ as Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or you baptize in the name of Paul I thank God that I baptized none of you but but Crispus and Gaius least any should say that I had baptized in my own and are baptized also the household of of stefania's besides i know not whether i baptized any other for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect now the now the ministries of Paul himself of Paulus Cephas they were God sent ministries the Canela T the believers gathered around these ministries where they would Connelly say this ministries this ministry and this one is not as good as this one these all had these were all I imagined they had different temperaments they had different gifts in the body so Connolly one preferred one above the other but if they were spiritual about it they'd understand that this God is a God of variety and he seen some fossils and some of prophets and some teachers and evangelists and pastors and they're all built differently and so but Connelly they begin to gather around the humanity of ministry even though but it wasn't the ministry causing this it was the carnality of the people and then where you missed out the I'm of Christ well what does that mean I don't need anyone to teach me I don't need to go to church I just listen to tapes I bring into today's language that's of Christ okay you're following me thus far so all of these things are still here but I believe we're living in a day an hour we are gathering around human you know the human what he call it the nature of a ministry has come to an end I mean but we can take any ministry that God has seen and we can appreciate it for what it is and see how it's all part of the body I mean for our benefit I mean I trust you can see it that way amen and then also now these ones allowed sin just to be rampant in the church 1st Corinthians 5 and 1 because remember I said there are a liberal Church they're liberal churches it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such occasion is not as so such as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife and year puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you so they just it's been commonly it's been reported commonly to this fornication among you said wasn't a secret it was actually knowing it was just there see liberal Church they you know they didn't grieve over the sin that had gone and instead this person they just they just let it happen see you say well liberalism's and you think no it's an old thing because in the first stage it's here at the end amen and so we have the Corinthians here what church you you so you might say just put it down what church are we I trust we're a word Church that's balanced amen I remember the Corinthians were believers you read seeking Corinthians that sees that the man that was doing that repented and he was still in the faith now we have the Galatian Church it's got the book of Galatians that we doing for time right now collation Church now the Galatians do we know he you know the Apostle Paul I remember the Galatians wasn't just one Church it was to the churches of Galatia such there was actually a group of churches in an area now we got verse six of Galatians chapter one it says I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you under grace unto the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed and we say as we said before so I say now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for neither I received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ and then he begins to pulp against aloud his experience now Paul went straight to the course of the matter they say that that the Galatians have brought in things that were not in the message and it was the influence of a previous age that influenced them and it was the Jew the law yo it was the believers of the Old Testament law had come in they meant we will read the book of Galatians this may be seen for elementary but it was it was the light of a previous age had affected them in such a way that they weren't walking in the truth anymore but they had mixed it now with what the Old Testament was saying to do but they had been released from that and they mean to be walking with with the Lord and so he says I'm I believe she be be so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ so so here's now so why do you say light of a former age I'll put it into today's language people are influenced by Pentecost and a bad way in in the wrong way and brother MC is that the Pentecost will move they were good legalists Peter Kostas good legalists have you heard him saying it so people now people bring legalism into the message and they make people outwardly conform and wear their clothes certain lengths right you know like some people say women have got to have long sleeves and the girl and the dresses are going to be scraping the floor well that's not exactly what brother Brown said as long as the skirt goes goes under the knee you're looking at me like what are you talking about right but some people say no it has to be this way otherwise you're not a believer well what is that that's just adding actually to the word it's adding to the wood just like the Galatians did but it looks so much better just like you know if the if we win and we compared like many people say oh I'm the Muslim so devout how they pray so much they do all the same to do the outwardly it looks very religious but there's no reality to it and you bring it right way close to the truth that you say are these people who dress so holy and they look so pious but is there a life being produced what is their ultimate as it oh look my I dress a certain way therefore I'm going in a rapture no it shouldn't be long here long dresses long faces many people like that there's nothing wrong with long hair long dresses but shouldn't be long faces I do this because I have to and I get Bureau that should be out of a love amen so now and then he begins to Paul you know he begins to show them now it is not he's isn't Galatians three and one Oh foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you this only what I learned have you received you the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith how did you receive it because they didn't receive it by the works of the law but faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God and when faith is conceived in the heart then it produces the word amen are you so foolish having begun in the spirit that you are now made perfect by the flesh amen and people get very rigid and this is how things you have to be we have to have everything perfect and you know and they make it their major and that is it and they're justified by the works of the flesh these people are here what are we so it's easy to say all that persons like this but at reality you shouldn't be so this is just I want to say these things to maybe give a bit of stability you can understand every condition of the churches and the New Testament are here today now it doesn't mean they're not believers and you know you know but people it's like if you're you know brother Bram says if someone's very scholarly and they don't keep it under prayer they'll become very dogmatic and very you know if you're built a certain way if you're very emotional kind of person if you don't keep it under the pre and go off into just purely sensations and emotions or if you're very scholarly you can you can be pushed the other way and you're just very dogmatic and rigid and your understanding so you've got a you got to keep your even your your own nature that it will try and push you one way or another and the thing that influences you becomes your absolute because you begin to live according to this thing that's like a you know like a like a young man and and and someone in his life yes yes oh you'll never just like summer oh you'll never be an astronaut and the little kid goes I'll show you you know well yeah and he becomes national why did he do that he says I'm going to prove to that one you know I'm gonna prove to him I'm gonna be an astronaut well who becomes absolute the guy says you'll never be that and they start to live before that person's comment amen and so we have to by God's grace not lean to the left or right but walk straight down the middle and so the galatians are here the hebrews are here the Ephesians are here too now our brother Bram says at the Ephesian Church they weren't they weren't carnal like the Corinthians everything was out of order but they these people were spiritual people and he could really teach them deep things but we read it and notice how he begins to speak in Ephesians 5 where he says wives submit yourselves unto your own husband's unto the Lord even as the husband as the head of the wife even as Christ as the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes cherishes that even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church now nevertheless that every one of you in particular so love his wife even of himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband so these ones that got so deep in mysteries they had forgotten was like - actually these mysteries that they had received it has to actually work out in your life so if God has redeemed us husbands now if he has redeemed us then then redemption will be lived out through us now not the saving of our you know we do we don't die for our family but redemption is to redeem that and place it back to where it should be right that is redemption you claim you redeem it you you lay claim on what is fallen and you lift it back up to where it should be and so redemption should be lived out from the husband down into the family where it's not and and we'll read about it in 1st or 2nd Peter where he says that they the husband and wife adjoint is together so and the Old Testament it was the Jewish woman were second-class citizens to the mean they were seeing in class but but in the New Testament and that is showing now under the law the church is a singing class citizen to Christ I mean to God but by the blood of Jesus Christ we are lifted up to be joint heirs with Christ that is what we are and says we are joint heirs with him were a he is our head but he's lifted us up to where he is Alleluia and so now a man who's under the law still down choices family downtrod says his wife amen that's what you you see it even though they say hallelujah I mean while being redeemed and you know the grace of God has come into my life you know if they're either leaning the wrong way or they're actually still under the law and try and do it in their own strength their family will be downtrodden but if God is really does if God himself has stepped into that vessel I mean all their heart will be I want to lift amen that where I am they'll be joining us with me that's why Redemption has to be actually he say I am redeemed well let's see it in your life because what will you want to do you don't want to see your even your brother and sister yo people who look down their nose or this person will never get there and this person still you know they're still battling with this and they'll never grow from parthis you know their person they need to come to the altar themselves I mean because if Christ is in the heart of the believer they'll want to say come up here where I am I mean don't kick people down or try to climb up help them up that's what we should do and so your Redemption should be should be manifested at us Allu you and then he talks about children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right and then and then he keeps and then honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee although children do you want it to be well with you amen that thou mayest live long on the earth and ye father's provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord so he's talking about general family things waste trying to say you have to you know don't just be caught up in all these mysteries and forget your family you know it's like Joseph and Mary they went to Jerusalem they took Jesus they want 10 or 12 year-old boy they go to the feast I have a glorious time and they journey back home three days and they say where is he gone they left them behind somewhere as the same thing now you know many parents we can just get caught up and how glorious God is and then we around or where our children go on you got to bring them with you bring them with you whatever you do you say well they just little they won't understand too much I tell you what if the if the message if you can convey it down to them I tell you you'll be blessed but you'll be more blessing them if you can break it down into its real just simplicity hallelujah you'll be having a more glorious time than they know I think you know so sometimes I'll read the children's Bible I think I enjoy it more than my girls hallelujah I mean I love it hallelujah man and then now it's good I did mention it but we'll just go to Peter here because Peter is speaking to believers as well any season and our closes with first Peter three and one he says likewise he husband's dwell dwell with them according to knowledge which is understanding giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so saying you need to know how to dwell with your family dwell with your wife we're gonna go into this on Sunday but so he's all these people are here I kind of went from a church now I'm down down to the family but all these people are here churches are like this they're around the place people are you know Paul speaks about don't and in the book of Hebrews do not lead a root of goodness come in and overthrow you and you can and you see especially ministers and cuz we're all human but things and even not even mrs. but but but later you like things can happen bad things can happen and it can enter and it can begin to grow as a root of bitterness you know in the person and they begin to look through that above anything else and they begin to minister through that or they begin to live through that and treat their family something can happen from not even from their family but it can influence them in a bad way and then and then through that they can actually try and live for their family but they're being affected by the sort of burdens and unfortunately you can see that as well and we're all not immune from it you know brother Brown preaching standing in the gap he says I lost my love for the people because they are turning down turning down the Lord and so he's being pushed too soon because of because of the rejection that he had to he had to suffer that rejection because there's a scripture saying behold I stand the door and knock and if any man opens the door I'll come and sup with him and he with me now he had to actually live out that scripture that was Christ being rejected we know from the church world but he had to he had to experience because he says I moved I moved down here to Tucson I've been here three years not one Church has invited me and he begins you know it comes down the end of his ministry says you know the full gospel businessman there's really only open door I have left and he's there on the outside trying to get in just like Christ is trying to get into the church but they kicked him out and but but it made him lose his love for the people and if that happened you say and here's a man here's a man who's been redeemed he's come to us adoption he's an adopted son but yet he loses his love for the people because of what has happened so none of us means I mean you think the prophet who that who the sword of the word came into his hand go back to Jeffersonville the seven seals going to be made known hallelujah here it was here he had the dispensation of the gospel for the same time amen incredible ministry he says but I lost my love for the people I have to get it back and he was being to make plans in his mind I'm gonna go live up northern British Columbia I'll be a trapper I'll be a hunter like a boys wanted to be it's because he lost his love for the people and we have to be careful friends this can happen to us to take a hit happened to him it happened to us because Elijah was a man of like passions Amen so we have to be careful of these things to not affect us now why did you say all this because it's all here go read that go read the epistles we Paul speaks about you know how the Galatian the condition error' in this way you understand where you see different movements and different things going on among the believers you say well why they like this why is this happening why are people fighting used to be more in the past I like this ministry I don't like this ministry you don't see you know we could go back into the Old Testament where maybe there's a maybe assuming in the bottle spring your brother brother Herman saying but brother branham he identified himself he says the first sermon I preached this is history repeating himself he says the first sermon I preached when I before I left the tabernacle was David and Goliath he says the great giant intellectual giant out there saying the days of miracles have passed I'm gonna go take the slingshot of faith I'm gonna go defeat that giant and he went out and killed the Giant and then he but then he begin to be a you know he was on the run in the church world amen he was he was kicked out members Christ that was on the run he said oh speaking of the rejected King and he was actually identifying in Scripture this is where you are as a people right and then now Saul but then what happens is now we are living at a time where where it used to be the anointing on the church was the man age anointing and the Pentecostal move was the end of the man age in programs is when the Eagle begins to fly me when the fourth seal yet when the seals open the fourth seal opens the Eagle begins to fly and we're now ready girl anointing he says the anointing is overlap like church age is Overland right and then so David's anointed king but the effect of Saul these former age there was man that there was man's wisdom how would you have a king well he'd be taller than everyone else he was big and strong you'd look like a king Saul was man's choice God where David was God's choice and then now there was a fight between two ages now Saul's Saul was they'll both anointed by the Prophet right this is a movement now I'm sorry I'm to try probably I can inch too much but go read 1st and 2nd Samuel go read from the prophet Samuel to Solomon building the temple and there was like a millennium their program says it was a millennium for Israel the first part of his reign you've gone to that span we're living in that span as well go read the Bible it's not just stories or you know it's more than that because if you can see this is where the this is where the believers were this is what they faced this is how they overcame you say now I can see this is where I was this is where I'm going and this is how I overcome a meant and then you see you see Saul dies in battle you know David's coming into power but now the house of Saul and the house of David of fighting this civil war and so there's fights there's been church wars within the message now of the seals the clothes the seals are open and there's been bitter fighting and there's been people it doesn't matter what side you know these people being like Joab the wars ended he says I'm going to get revenge on that brother calls him out of the City of Refuge kills him kills what Abner he was in a City of Refuge he was when assault generals he killed Joe Ed's brother so well how do you kill people today murder them booted their influence that that is murder that's like drag is going out and stabbing them with a sword and this yo but you see so the house of Saul goes down that a man agent 19 as God I'm going off the scene the Eagle anointing come forth again we we have what they had that's why we had Sunday Sunday was glorious but it shouldn't be a surprise to us we should expect him to move like that amen that's what they had a Pentecost that he's still the same today but God doesn't take away he adds how lujah he just adds to and so now the house of Saul I mean the house of David comes into power then the tribes gather say let's make David King over all of us lujah then that now brings forth Solomon and Solomon brings forth a millennium amen go read your Bible well the band said this is a new book this is a new book and so you need to go read go go read those places read from Samuel to Solomon and read from John the Baptist to the end of the New Testament he said that's a lot of reading that you'll find you see menace you know you see mission work that's happened around the world as it normally happened song gets a burden we heard about it up far north all these different ministries were there where boon for this cancer we had a burden for our people and God just open a door people go to another country to go to another place that meets a certain someone like Lydia the seller of purple there on the riverbank you know that be called a certain place have a burden God opens the door people are burst into the kingdom churches are established there may be a call go over here do this come here do this separating to meet Paul and Barnabas for the work Alleluia and history has repeated itself I mean we have some musicians to come but history it's all repeated itself but now we've come to a time where I trust we are none of the bad of those churches in the New Testament we're all of the good and we've come to our Ephesians as brother M system I believe its paradox that we come to another Ephesians but we're not going to roulette amen and relax and go down we'll get a piece of the mark of the high calling because we're anointed to do it hallelujah and we will possess we will become what is prophesied in the Bible as brother ant as Jesus fulfilled the old all the Old Testament the bride will fulfill the new hallelujah I mean let's sing the original life the
