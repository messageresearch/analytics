[47:29] Lord amen you may be seated in the
[47:32] presence of God this morning hallelujah
[47:35] you know you asked that question
[47:37] you prayed that when you were singing
[47:39] take me into the Holy of Holies who
[47:42] believes that when you pray that it
[47:45] happens it's not just a pretty song you
[47:48] get a little shiver but you see if you
[47:51] had found yourself walking out of God's
[47:55] presence
[47:56] you know surely goodness and mercy shall
[47:57] follow me yes but you know brother
[47:59] Branham talked about somebody that they
[48:02] can actually come out of a person with
[48:04] the Holy Ghost can actually come out of
[48:06] fellowship with them if they grieve him
[48:07] and a faith they can think they can get
[48:10] a wolf nature on him and and that and
[48:13] the Holy Spirit goes and waits up on a
[48:15] tree he uses that as an analogy and he
[48:17] perches there any waits he waits for the
[48:20] Lamb nature to come back you know what
[48:22] the good thing is through the blood of
[48:25] Jesus Christ that's not a groveling back
[48:27] to God you don't grovel your way back to
[48:30] God amen
[48:31] hallelujah the moment that you repent
[48:34] the moment that you make it right
[48:37] you're a fellowship has restored 100%
[48:41] there is no it's like you never did it
[48:43] in the first place that's justified amen
[48:47] it's beyond forgiving amen you're beyond
[48:50] forgiving this morning you're beyond
[48:52] forgiving hallelujah do you realize that
[48:54] is there a reality to you this
[48:56] you are beyond forgiving you are
[48:58] justified in God's eyes you never sinned
[49:01] in the first place that's the power of
[49:04] his blood that's why when you sing take
[49:06] me into the Holies of Holies and maybe
[49:08] before you sung that song there was
[49:10] something that happened in your life and
[49:11] you said Lord if it to you forgive me
[49:14] father I don't want that in my life
[49:16] anymore I'll lay those things down these
[49:19] weights that so it easily beset me I lay
[49:20] them all down because I want to be in
[49:23] your presence I want to be in fellowship
[49:25] with you I want to walk in your presence
[49:27] this morning I want to live in your
[49:29] presence I want to remain in an
[49:31] atmosphere of perfect love hallelujah I
[49:33] don't want anything to be able to affect
[49:35] me anymore
[49:35] Amen I want to be you know and this was
[49:37] what I'm preaching to myself here I want
[49:40] to remain a net presence hallelujah when
[49:42] someone to meet annoys me or some person
[49:45] or some circumstance is annoying to me I
[49:48] don't want to allow that to pull me down
[49:50] into a natural stand to anger and into
[49:54] frustration you know and there's a lot
[49:56] of things in our lives that happen
[49:57] around us and our lives that pull us
[49:59] into frustration or you know for young
[50:02] guys they'll see a pretty female walking
[50:04] down the street and they lust after that
[50:06] female and that pulls them down into a
[50:07] carnal state and they get frustrated and
[50:12] the devil starts condemning them because
[50:13] they're you know they're getting all
[50:15] condemned over the thing and and then
[50:17] they find themselves you know that
[50:19] blessed atmosphere that they had was
[50:21] gone but then you see the look knows
[50:25] your heart and he knows what you need
[50:27] and I'm gonna clear to you today this is
[50:31] Liberty day and this is Liberty morning
[50:34] amen
[50:35] this is your Liberty morning this is the
[50:37] morning if there's anything in your life
[50:39] that you want Liberty from this is your
[50:42] morning this is your day this is your
[50:44] hour to be liberated because the Liberty
[50:47] is here with the Spirit of the Lord is
[50:49] there is Liberty
[50:50] hallelujah if there's anything you just
[50:53] put it before the Lord this morning you
[50:55] just lay it in his feet this morning
[50:57] I've laid mine at his feet I've put mine
[51:00] before the Lord the things that I need
[51:02] out of my life that I want out of my
[51:04] life that I know that God has delivered
[51:05] me from that I know the blood is
[51:07] sufficient for that I know the Holy
[51:09] Ghost will
[51:10] to phi verses it says through the spirit
[51:12] that we multiplied the deeds of this
[51:13] flesh hallelujah is through the spirit
[51:16] you know he comes into our life it comes
[51:18] and he gives us power over our spirit
[51:22] and flesh over that old nature that
[51:24] wants to rise up why do you think in
[51:26] Romans 6 that says let not sin reign in
[51:29] your mortal bodies to obey it and the
[51:31] last there off you see their old nature
[51:34] has will then old nature wants to rise
[51:36] up then old nature has a constant
[51:39] uprising that it wants to do in your
[51:41] life because it wants to sin it wants to
[51:43] be sinful and it nibble it won't ever
[51:45] stop until you get rid of this body but
[51:48] you see that the sended captain
[51:50] hallelujah that the sins down into our
[51:53] life to give us dominion over spirit and
[51:58] flesh
[51:59] hey man aren't you so glad that you can
[52:01] have now that is not now this is where
[52:03] it becomes amazing now you your
[52:06] leadership
[52:08] if you don't roll over your spirit with
[52:11] malevolence and and and and legalism no
[52:15] she'll be a very unhappy old nature you
[52:18] have to rule with love you have to rule
[52:21] with benevolence you have to rule your
[52:24] spirit and take dominion over your flesh
[52:27] like a righteous King that is fear don't
[52:32] put yourself under so much pressure all
[52:34] the time you got to put all these things
[52:36] in all your gonna the safe this and it
[52:39] because you'll just end up getting
[52:41] yourself in a fix and you keep not
[52:42] getting condemned and then you need to
[52:44] fake the purpose of fellowship with God
[52:46] because you're so condemned all the time
[52:47] in your heart you don't want to be that
[52:50] way God didn't make it that way he's
[52:53] made it so that we can grow so that we
[52:55] can be freed from things a little bit
[52:57] but we stay and fellowship with him
[52:58] along the way
[52:59] isn't that a great provision who's
[53:01] thankful for that provision thankful
[53:03] that we don't have to be condemned to
[53:05] all our way to perfection we can be
[53:07] liberated to perfection hallelujah
[53:10] that's worth praising God about amen
[53:13] okay let's just read from Romans 11 it
[53:16] says behold therefore the goodness and
[53:19] severity
[53:21] of God it's quite a you could say an
[53:27] oxymoron of of words and the same
[53:30] sentence the goodness and severity of
[53:33] God and you know he was talking about
[53:36] Israel and how they you know God was so
[53:40] good to them but there was also a
[53:42] justice for what they would if they if
[53:44] they sewed the wrong seed they would get
[53:46] the wrong harvest that's the severity so
[53:49] there is a severity so yes and I
[53:52] preached the Liberty and and and it's so
[53:54] good and you don't get condemned but
[53:56] there is also what you shall sow you
[53:58] shall reap so there is also a harvest
[54:00] that comes from the works of must flesh
[54:03] we doin the things that we say and what
[54:07] we allow ourselves to be ruled by and
[54:10] it's a very curve and it's and it's a
[54:13] very stimulating and all the stuff going
[54:16] on in our lives and we're constantly
[54:17] making decisions and and the devil's got
[54:21] it all he's got a lot of stuff covered
[54:23] all around he's got all the media and
[54:25] he's got everything and there's all
[54:26] these voices and they're trying to and
[54:28] every day you make that we all make
[54:29] decisions what are we going to allow to
[54:32] rule us what are we going to allow to
[54:33] lead us now well the I say liberty day
[54:39] the subject is taking advantage of
[54:42] Liberty now there's a two types of
[54:45] advantage taking there's an there's a
[54:48] positive advantage taking which God
[54:49] wants us to take advantage of our
[54:51] Liberty and make the most of it being
[54:53] this taking advantage of Liberty in this
[54:56] negative sense where you the we're grace
[55:00] becomes a bandage for you for your
[55:02] desire for sin where grace becomes
[55:06] abandoned for you adhering to voices
[55:08] that are not the voice of God for you to
[55:10] become subject to a certain spirit or
[55:13] subject to a fashion or subject to a
[55:15] cultural mindset or subject to your own
[55:18] humanistic thoughts and leadership there
[55:23] is that taking advantage of the grace of
[55:25] God and so we see we want to draw a
[55:28] really fine balance of taking advantage
[55:31] of Liberty we don't want to and you see
[55:34] there is too
[55:35] as their administration is different
[55:38] from ours there is an administration
[55:40] that forces people to do a certain way
[55:42] and be a certain thing and perform and
[55:45] in the church you might look at the
[55:47] church from an outward perspective of
[55:49] your visiting and it looks so good and
[55:50] everything everyone's behaving
[55:52] themselves but down inside is a
[55:54] dictatorship going on and things is not
[55:57] what they seem all right but then the
[56:00] people are conforming to an image they
[56:02] kind of is not necessarily a Victorian
[56:06] dictatorship but there's a pressure
[56:08] right a real pressure from the people
[56:11] and one little thing steps out and
[56:13] everyone cranes their neck and looks and
[56:15] goes and then you get a you'll get them
[56:18] you'll get the Deacons coming and seeing
[56:20] you after church and saying look at the
[56:21] performance you did they don't know why
[56:23] weren't you there
[56:24] why weren't you at church this week and
[56:26] what was this going on here and
[56:27] everything is all administered by
[56:29] humanistic leadership and and it's
[56:32] pushed on you and the pressures on you I
[56:34] was reading the doctrines of the
[56:37] exclusive Brisbane Church because I know
[56:40] a lot of them and I'm really fascinated
[56:42] by why they are the way they are it's
[56:44] amazing how much that whole it's like
[56:48] replacing the Holy Spirit to - there's
[56:51] an image and they read in the Bible and
[56:53] everything they have in the Bible that
[56:54] they do is is based on Scripture it's
[56:58] not really anything that isn't based on
[57:00] Scripture but one it's the slant on it
[57:02] but - it's it's actually they read it
[57:06] and they go we've got to do this and so
[57:08] they administer then so because the Holy
[57:11] Ghost was I'm just gonna stay at playing
[57:13] the Holy Ghost has departed from them
[57:14] they don't have the Holy Ghost
[57:16] so therefore they've got to push it on
[57:17] the people and make it happen
[57:19] right so that's but then this that way
[57:23] actually made its way into the frame
[57:25] we've got a message - is that whole
[57:27] humanistic leadership and their whole
[57:29] make every one brother branham preaches
[57:32] the image so Joshua preached the land
[57:34] and gave them their inheritance so they
[57:35] went and got it
[57:36] brother Branham preached now lend our
[57:38] inheritance the image of Christ the
[57:40] perfection the manifested sons what it
[57:42] is to be a real son of God to have
[57:44] dominion and the life that you should
[57:46] live in the conduct order and doctrine
[57:48] of your life and how you carry yourself
[57:51] with an excellent spirit and you're in
[57:53] time Daniel that nothing can affect you
[57:55] and even your enemies test if I could
[57:57] against you about you right and then so
[58:01] the ministry you will get excited and
[58:03] the people get excited and then they
[58:04] make it try and force it to happen and
[58:06] you end up with miserable a miserable
[58:10] condition at first it might be okay when
[58:13] people first get saved and they're all
[58:15] but then when all the trials start and
[58:17] it all gets hard and and that just
[58:18] becomes miserable and the children you
[58:20] know they try and force her on the
[58:21] children and children don't have the
[58:22] Holy Ghost yet and they get they just
[58:24] become rebellious and it just causes
[58:26] division so there's there okay there's
[58:29] that side then there's the other side
[58:31] which we we going to go to the balance
[58:34] after this but there's the other side
[58:36] which the the administration knows the
[58:39] image and that's being preached but
[58:40] nothing there is no enforcement of it
[58:44] right but but and and and the complete
[58:49] liberal siders just allow the people to
[58:52] discover God for themselves completely
[58:54] right and and and the people and and and
[59:00] and that where it goes out of balances
[59:02] let's and become rampant just let let it
[59:06] all sort of just happen and don't worry
[59:08] about anything and because people will
[59:09] grow and they'll have their own kind of
[59:11] experience once one day but you'll find
[59:14] that the Holy Ghost departs from that
[59:15] too because it becomes too much for the
[59:17] pure Holy Ghost
[59:19] it's a Holy Spirit it doesn't want that
[59:22] to happen and then you find the balance
[59:25] and the balance is the leadership of the
[59:29] Holy Ghost in the gifts and the callings
[59:32] and gifts of God and the pastoral gifts
[59:35] and the ministry gifts and the Deacons
[59:37] gifts and the everyone's gifts and the
[59:39] sunday-school gifts and the musicians
[59:41] gives God being poured out into the
[59:45] people God being manifested now when
[59:49] you're in the balance which I believe
[59:52] we're in a balance where we can and that
[59:56] we can grow nothing's forced on anyone
[59:59] no one gets things forced on them to be
[1:00:01] a certain way but yet its breached the
[1:00:04] image is preached and that's good now we
[1:00:08] this is where it becomes like the Garden
[1:00:10] of Eden again we have the opportunity to
[1:00:14] decide are we going to embody this
[1:00:17] message are we going to let it become
[1:00:20] flesh are we going to embrace it and
[1:00:23] this is where we can take advantage on
[1:00:25] both sides so we're sitting in between
[1:00:29] heaven and earth you could say well
[1:00:30] heaven and hell sorry brother Brad said
[1:00:33] we're actually dangling over hell with
[1:00:35] the Word of God so you can rely on the
[1:00:37] the strength of that word and your faith
[1:00:41] in that word because we're hanging over
[1:00:43] hell with the word of God and it's not
[1:00:45] to scare anybody but that's that's what
[1:00:48] it is and it really is what it is
[1:00:50] now that chain if that chains holding us
[1:00:53] and this is just coming fresh but if
[1:00:55] that chains holding us I'm going to
[1:00:59] embrace that chain
[1:01:00] I ain't going to just be wishy-washy
[1:01:03] about it you know I'm not going to be
[1:01:05] casual about it but when that chain gets
[1:01:07] preached to me and it sounds bad chain
[1:01:09] but the word is like we're a love
[1:01:10] present of Jesus Christ which came to
[1:01:12] him in the chains of His divine love and
[1:01:15] if that chain i when i hear that chain
[1:01:18] being ministered to me with all my heart
[1:01:20] with all my energy and everything that i
[1:01:22] have i'm going to embrace it I'm gonna
[1:01:24] hold it I'm gonna believe it become one
[1:01:26] with me and I want it to become flesh in
[1:01:27] my life and if there's anything that the
[1:01:29] Lord puts on my heart this is a blockage
[1:01:31] in your and your channels of inspiration
[1:01:35] and communication and that's stopping
[1:01:37] you from this oh god take it well lay it
[1:01:41] down if I have to suffer for your name's
[1:01:43] eight
[1:01:44] praise the Lord that's the balance it's
[1:01:49] kind of that's where we're going
[1:01:51] so it's behold therefore the goodness
[1:01:53] and severity of God the goodness as
[1:01:57] being ministered him we're just being
[1:01:59] blessed and things that's happening in
[1:02:00] lives are changing transforming power is
[1:02:02] here hallelujah the transforming power
[1:02:05] of God is here amen
[1:02:08] the goodness but then there's the
[1:02:09] severity of God we cannot escape the
[1:02:12] severe
[1:02:12] of God we cannot escape the Justice of
[1:02:15] God amen
[1:02:17] if we shun the goodness amen
[1:02:23] so when that chains hanging over hanging
[1:02:25] me over hell I'm holding on to that
[1:02:27] chain with everything that I am and
[1:02:28] whenever a word comes forth from me I
[1:02:30] take it for me
[1:02:31] amen this sermon is for everybody amen
[1:02:35] and I encourage you don't pitchfork
[1:02:37] today because it's also an easy ones a
[1:02:40] pitchfork on you no because it's just
[1:02:42] personal
[1:02:42] so we lit lit let's own it for ourselves
[1:02:45] and and you know I enjoy this type of
[1:02:49] the subject because this is our
[1:02:53] inheritance we can be free from all
[1:02:55] bondage anson amen so says here in James
[1:02:58] 1:25 but whoso looketh into the perfect
[1:03:01] law of Liberty and continuous theron he
[1:03:05] being not a forgetful hearer but a doer
[1:03:06] of the work this man shall be blessed in
[1:03:09] his deed shall be blessed in the action
[1:03:11] of his life he that does it because you
[1:03:14] see we can have faith we can have all
[1:03:16] the faith and and say it all out but
[1:03:20] that faith needs to have an action their
[1:03:22] faith needs to have substance that faith
[1:03:24] that action that needs to put on flesh
[1:03:26] that's what I'm saying
[1:03:28] that's when you hear the word and you
[1:03:30] and you welcome it you say yes that's
[1:03:33] for me who old whatever it takes I want
[1:03:36] that for my life
[1:03:37] even now hallelujah I don't want to just
[1:03:41] sit here and enjoy the message and sit
[1:03:43] here and enjoy the revelation and enjoy
[1:03:45] how the all comes together and the
[1:03:47] vision and all of those things but I
[1:03:50] want and I'm going to have the very
[1:03:53] embodiment the very faith and because I
[1:03:57] want the the works of faith to be
[1:04:00] expressed in my life I want the reality
[1:04:02] in my life I don't just want to sit and
[1:04:05] enjoy it on Sunday and sit and enjoy it
[1:04:08] when I listen to a prophet or a preacher
[1:04:09] during a week and but I want it to be in
[1:04:13] my life I want the works to be expressed
[1:04:16] and come forth amen so whoso looketh
[1:04:19] into the perfect law of Liberty and I
[1:04:21] believe we're going to look into this
[1:04:23] law and a law as an enforcement
[1:04:26] of something that is substantial and
[1:04:30] something that has that I don't even
[1:04:32] know how to express it but a law is
[1:04:34] something strong and this is a law of
[1:04:37] Liberty and the law of Liberty liberate
[1:04:40] sus from sin amen
[1:04:43] the law of Liberty you see it's
[1:04:45] connected to this Ten Commandments in
[1:04:47] the whole law and the prophets hanging
[1:04:49] upon the Royal law which is the love thy
[1:04:51] neighbor love thy God with all thy heart
[1:04:53] and love thy neighbour as thyself and
[1:04:55] all the law and prophets hang from these
[1:04:57] and God says that I will write my laws
[1:05:00] and the fleshly tables of their hearts
[1:05:01] and I will put my laws in their mind and
[1:05:04] this morning may it just be put in your
[1:05:06] mind again
[1:05:07] may it be renewed in your mind the law
[1:05:10] of Liberty that all those things that
[1:05:12] the Prophet preached that seemed like
[1:05:14] just trivial stuff and carnal not carnal
[1:05:17] but natural things and all that stuff
[1:05:19] that's been written on your heart and
[1:05:21] hid in the prophet now when you receive
[1:05:24] the Holy Ghost and then the prophets
[1:05:26] come along and he starts putting it into
[1:05:28] your mind it's that's preaching into
[1:05:30] your mind and then fun finally one day
[1:05:31] you say yes I'm greeing with that I want
[1:05:34] to do that and all of a sudden that just
[1:05:36] gains access to it
[1:05:37] what's written in your heart already and
[1:05:40] it pulls it out and you it becomes flesh
[1:05:41] and faith becomes works well faith puts
[1:05:46] on works so look until it's look into
[1:05:50] the perfect law of Liberty and
[1:05:52] continuous Theron Amen he being not a
[1:05:55] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[1:05:57] this man shall be blessed in his deed
[1:06:00] Alleluia stand fast with Galatians 5:1
[1:06:04] stand fast therefore in the Liberty
[1:06:06] wherewith Christ has made us free and be
[1:06:08] not entangled again in the yoke of
[1:06:10] bondage hallelujah we are in a battle
[1:06:15] Saints we're in a fight this is a
[1:06:18] constant fight don't think Oh finally
[1:06:23] it's over it's not over it's this fight
[1:06:27] so if you just if you can there's Isaac
[1:06:30] preacher's resolve if you can just
[1:06:31] resign yourself and resolve the issue in
[1:06:34] your mind I'm fighting until the day I'm
[1:06:36] dying you'll actually start to be
[1:06:38] encouraged in it
[1:06:40] you'll encourage yourself on the Lord
[1:06:41] you'll start really gearing your
[1:06:43] thinking in your mind and the way you
[1:06:45] are and the actions of your life towards
[1:06:48] this battle towards this race that is
[1:06:50] set before you run it with patience Amy
[1:06:54] the devil is going to take and he's
[1:06:56] going to take advantage of you if you've
[1:06:58] got weights and sins in your life that
[1:07:00] easily beset him he'll take advantage of
[1:07:02] those things it's illegal ground into
[1:07:04] your life that he will use to try and
[1:07:08] get at you and because they're things
[1:07:10] and you know that they're wrong and
[1:07:11] there's legal ground things in your home
[1:07:16] that may be just pleasing to the Lord
[1:07:18] there's also legal ground for the devil
[1:07:21] to come into your home and cause trouble
[1:07:22] that's why it's so important that we
[1:07:25] discern as parents as we discern as
[1:07:27] children as this pleasing to the Lord
[1:07:30] ask you everything that you do all that
[1:07:32] you have what all the stuff that you
[1:07:34] watch everything the question should be
[1:07:36] Lord is this pleasing to you as this
[1:07:39] pleasing to you because if it's not the
[1:07:41] devil's got legal ground
[1:07:42] it's a spiritual legal ground now and he
[1:07:45] uses that against people to try and get
[1:07:48] at them and get at them and get at them
[1:07:50] and pull them down because he doesn't
[1:07:53] want sons of God to rise up to the
[1:07:54] position because when the son is in his
[1:07:56] position the devil was very sad very
[1:07:58] scared hey man he's scared of you he
[1:08:02] fears you
[1:08:03] amen so he'll do everything he can to
[1:08:06] push you down to keep you on the ground
[1:08:09] to clip your wings keep your wings
[1:08:11] clipped
[1:08:12] hallelujah but you see God has liberated
[1:08:15] us amen so that we don't have to have
[1:08:18] clipped wings so that we don't have to
[1:08:19] be earthbound Birds a million chickens
[1:08:22] in the barn the hallelujah he's PISA
[1:08:25] liberated us so that we can spread our

[1:10:16] oh it's going to be so hard if iris goes
[1:10:18] out of my life it's going to be so hard
[1:10:20] because I'm going to be thinking about a
[1:10:21] little time and these through this and
[1:10:23] this through that and the circumstance
[1:10:25] and that and this confusion no the easy
[1:10:28] way it's to just let God have his way he
[1:10:31] brings it all into place he's the master
[1:10:33] mm-hmm he's the master builder a man he
[1:10:37] knows how to build our life
[1:10:38] and when it's all laid down when
[1:10:40] everything's laid down it's all down to
[1:10:42] scratch and he's you're giving God a
[1:10:45] white canvas to build on he can paint
[1:10:47] your life he can paint that image you
[1:10:49] didn't see the image before the
[1:10:51] foundation of the world he saw it he
[1:10:54] knows what you really are he knows what
[1:10:56] you're made of he put all your parents
[1:10:58] and great-great-great grandparents all
[1:11:00] together because he knew what you needed
[1:11:01] to look like he painted you and he got
[1:11:05] all other different temperaments and
[1:11:06] everything in the circumstance
[1:11:07] so that your temperament would be a
[1:11:09] certain way so that when he brings you
[1:11:12] like a bell you would ting a certain way
[1:11:14] amen so you'd have a certain ring a
[1:11:16] certain personality he saw you and he
[1:11:20] knows exactly the ingredients that need
[1:11:23] to happen in your life and you see we
[1:11:25] get so caught up with all these things
[1:11:27] and ambitions and hopes and plans and
[1:11:29] everything it's so caught up with it all
[1:11:32] torn down by this complex and this fear
[1:11:35] and everything like that and the Lord
[1:11:37] just wants us to say you done you
[1:11:39] finished lay it at my feet let me paint
[1:11:42] the image that I saw before the
[1:11:44] foundation of the world let me do it
[1:11:46] hallelujah cuz as soon as we stop trying
[1:11:49] to do it then God can do it hallelujah
[1:11:52] Amen it's you know a lot of us have been
[1:11:55] to school all our lives you know and
[1:11:57] school taught us all wrong school
[1:11:59] brought the wrong ideas and that was you
[1:12:02] do it all yourself your self esteem and
[1:12:04] selfless everything self build yourself
[1:12:06] up and push yourself into this thing and
[1:12:08] you have to achieve and you can't get
[1:12:10] nothing unless you earn it
[1:12:12] this is the whole mentality and you just
[1:12:15] get it drilled into you for fifteen or
[1:12:16] thirteen years or whatever it is all of
[1:12:19] those all day every day it strollin mine
[1:12:22] if you don't have Christian parents I
[1:12:24] mean it just gets children at home too
[1:12:26] oh you know what I mean and so you see
[1:12:29] that as a real issue that happens
[1:12:31] because the Christianity and the kingdom
[1:12:34] of God and the kingdom of heaven is the
[1:12:36] exact opposite Amen we just lay it all
[1:12:40] down
[1:12:40] we surrender it all and let God build us
[1:12:43] hallelujah so in Liberty he's liberated
[1:12:48] us from bondage in sin liberated us from
[1:12:55] culture man that's a tough one
[1:12:59] it gets so engrained in our thinking our
[1:13:03] culture our national culture our family
[1:13:06] culture whatever tribal cultures you
[1:13:10] know all those things as ingrained down
[1:13:12] into the almost into the genetics ridin
[1:13:16] and generation after generation after
[1:13:19] generation and it becomes this
[1:13:21] and a default in your life and you know
[1:13:25] if you if the devil catches you
[1:13:26] off-guard he will get you on that but
[1:13:30] God has liberated us from that you see a
[1:13:33] heavenly culture has descended in the
[1:13:36] form of a mighty angel with an open book
[1:13:38] in his hands who knows the mighty angel
[1:13:39] with the open book in his hands who's
[1:13:41] eaten from the mighty angels hand this
[1:13:43] morning hallelujah who's eaten from his
[1:13:46] hand who has eaten that book this
[1:13:49] morning will I tell you this morning if
[1:13:51] you're reading from their book you're
[1:13:53] feeding from a heavenly culture
[1:13:54] hallelujah
[1:13:55] you're feeding from a hidden culture
[1:13:57] that Heaven culture has come down
[1:13:59] because you see an earthly culture rose
[1:14:01] up out of the pits of hell amen
[1:14:04] and it got it got it it's real wings
[1:14:06] through all the media and all those
[1:14:08] things and and all of its just been
[1:14:10] played on and and you can see all of the
[1:14:12] evil cultures out of all the different
[1:14:14] tribes of Africa and all those things
[1:14:16] has kind of found its way into the
[1:14:18] Western society as well and all these
[1:14:20] bondages that have been part of things
[1:14:23] for thousands of years is all manifested
[1:14:25] on the earth what to magnify Satan's
[1:14:29] Babylonian culture magnify this culture
[1:14:32] that draws people away from God and
[1:14:34] keeps people away from God and makes
[1:14:37] them diff to God you'll find a lot of
[1:14:42] the stuff comes from all of those things
[1:14:45] but you see if you've come into
[1:14:48] fellowship with their angel amen if you
[1:14:50] you have received heavenly culture now
[1:14:54] it's your decision here because remember
[1:14:57] this image is not forced on you no one's
[1:15:01] forcing it on you there's no pressure
[1:15:03] for you I mean you create you there is
[1:15:07] pressure but it's not coming from men
[1:15:08] it's coming from the Holy Ghost James me
[1:15:10] gentle pressure and because there are
[1:15:13] people that have become heavenly
[1:15:15] cultured there's also that pressure as
[1:15:17] well you're seeing them and you're
[1:15:19] watching them and there you can see them
[1:15:20] having joy and peace and you wonder why
[1:15:23] you you don't have that same peace
[1:15:25] because you is a culture in your life
[1:15:28] probably that you still allowing so
[1:15:31] shape you store dictate to you
[1:15:34] and so there is that pressure and you
[1:15:36] and but the thing is no one's going to
[1:15:38] force you but don't take advantage of
[1:15:40] their you make the decision now I want
[1:15:43] that culture that heavily culture that's
[1:15:45] my eternal identity that's my culture
[1:15:47] that's where I come from I came from God
[1:15:49] and I go back to God amen hallelujah
[1:15:52] you're part of him jesus said in that
[1:15:55] day what day this day the day that all
[1:15:57] the mysteries of God shall be unveiled
[1:15:59] and revealed him a mighty God unveiled
[1:16:01] before us that day you shall know and I
[1:16:04] am and my father he and me and I knew
[1:16:07] who knows their eternal value who
[1:16:13] understands and who has come to a
[1:16:14] realization of their I turn eternal
[1:16:18] identity in that day you shall know you
[1:16:21] shall know it should be an intimate and
[1:16:23] understanding in your life hallelujah he
[1:16:28] was in the father and you're in him
[1:16:29] where does that put you then
[1:16:30] hallelujah that puts you in the father
[1:16:33] before the foundation of the world an
[1:16:35] eternal being so when he said the joke
[1:16:38] where were you in the sons of God
[1:16:39] shouted together in the morning stars
[1:16:41] saying where were you hallelujah you
[1:16:43] were there you were singing and
[1:16:45] rejoicing and eternity and I'll tell you
[1:16:47] right now you are there right now amen
[1:16:50] brother Brandon when he was taken up
[1:16:52] beyond the curtain of time generally
[1:16:53] said to his congregation I saw you all
[1:16:56] thee they must have blown their minds
[1:16:58] and probably went over their heads but
[1:17:00] today as the word has become open and
[1:17:02] things have become more intimate and God
[1:17:04] as it's 50 years later we can identify
[1:17:07] with that I'm actually there I'm part of
[1:17:11] God and part of the eternal being
[1:17:13] hallelujah
[1:17:15] and so if I'm a part of that then I'm
[1:17:17] going to make a decision I'm not forced
[1:17:19] to by any peer pressure because the
[1:17:22] churches are the Church of balance
[1:17:23] Liberty but I'm going to decide I want
[1:17:26] to be part of that heavenly culture I
[1:17:28] don't want to be part of the sinfully
[1:17:29] culture no Mahal I don't want to let
[1:17:31] this cultural ways and customs conform
[1:17:35] me because where does it come from bevel
[1:17:38] huh
[1:17:38] Amen hallelujah oh this is not on my
[1:17:43] list but I'll say it anyway it's come on
[1:17:44] my mind so I should just say
[1:17:48] Nebuchadnezzar made a big golden image
[1:17:52] you know and the whole world know and
[1:17:55] ruled at that time had to bow down and
[1:17:57] worship that image whole world and the
[1:18:01] way that he put them into that trance
[1:18:02] was through music Hollywood music as the
[1:18:07] now generation back there it was just
[1:18:09] the Pipers and Harper's and dulcimers
[1:18:10] and whatever they had when they started
[1:18:12] playing the whole Babylon bow down
[1:18:15] worship but the people that defied the
[1:18:21] King Nebuchadnezzar which is just like
[1:18:23] Satan today the people that said no I'm
[1:18:25] not going to allow this Hollywood music
[1:18:27] to shape my life I'm not going to fall
[1:18:29] into a trance to that music I'm not
[1:18:32] going to allow that to make me bow down
[1:18:34] to this big image that Satan has put up
[1:18:36] this big golden image this big statue of
[1:18:39] idolatry there's big Babylonian worship
[1:18:42] this big unified churches and all those
[1:18:44] things I'm not going to allow that what
[1:18:47] does that make nebuchadnezzar at you
[1:18:48] what did that what had it what anemic
[1:18:50] accounted nebuchadnezzar react how did
[1:18:53] he react to the Shadrach Meshach and
[1:18:55] Abednego he got angry he was so angry at
[1:18:59] them that he lost his cool and he lost
[1:19:02] his composure so you can imagine Satan's
[1:19:06] lost his composure at you he gets so
[1:19:08] angry at you because you reject the
[1:19:11] image that he's put up that he wants the
[1:19:13] whole world to fall down he wants a son
[1:19:15] or daughter of God to break the word he
[1:19:18] wants a son or daughter of God to go to
[1:19:20] hell that's what he wants that's his
[1:19:22] whole life's intention everything that
[1:19:25] he's wants is the one thing as for one
[1:19:28] of God's children to go to hell and be
[1:19:30] lost but King God lose one hallelujah
[1:19:34] all that the father has given me will
[1:19:36] come to me and I will in no wise cast
[1:19:38] that anyone that comes to me amen
[1:19:41] hallelujah hallelujah I believe we've
[1:19:43] come to him I believe as I said before
[1:19:46] he's not that the church's door for a
[1:19:48] long time now since 1950 whatever he's
[1:19:51] not that the church's door come out or
[1:19:55] sup with you
[1:19:56] coming there fellowship are being booted
[1:19:58] out of the churches but I want to
[1:20:00] fellowship with individuals when calling
[1:20:02] a bride out of a church or to fellowship
[1:20:05] with you and I believe I'm talking to
[1:20:07] people that heard that voice he came
[1:20:09] knocking amen he came knocking and he
[1:20:12] called Junie put and and now you're
[1:20:14] feasting hallelujah amen but you've
[1:20:19] rejected that image you've rejected that
[1:20:22] thing that Nebuchadnezzar is placed and
[1:20:24] I'm glad but you've seen by rejecting
[1:20:27] that you make the you make the devil
[1:20:29] very angry
[1:20:30] hallelujah and so all of the trials that
[1:20:33] you go through and all the hardships
[1:20:34] that you face as a result of you
[1:20:37] rejecting that image and there is that's
[1:20:40] black and white it's a black and white
[1:20:43] experience you know when you've rejected
[1:20:45] that because everything starts going
[1:20:47] hard for you and the devil gets pretty
[1:20:50] mad you know the glorious thing is that
[1:20:53] when they got chucked in that furnace
[1:20:54] bound what was happening when they got
[1:20:57] in there I mean one of those trials
[1:20:59] those fiery trials do in their life
[1:21:01] hallelujah Amen seasons so proud that he
[1:21:05] can't help but try and hurt you but
[1:21:06] every time he tries to hurt you he makes
[1:21:08] you stronger he makes you more holy he
[1:21:11] makes you pure and you get liberated
[1:21:13] Amen liberated from these things

[1:21:24] loves seeing God Amen amen because your
[1:21:27] hearts being made pure your you see

[1:21:35] channels cleaning out your spirit he's
[1:21:37] giving you your land all your promised
[1:21:40] land is all inside here you could say

[1:21:46] little I'll give you it little by little
[1:21:48] I'm gonna liberate you so that you can
[1:21:51] see God Amen took me as a psalm and it
[1:21:55] says that basically as you grow I'm
[1:21:57] going to exalt you to inherit the land
[1:21:59] oh when you and you shall see it I can't
[1:22:03] remember it is but I'll find it one day
[1:22:06] so you've been liberated from culture
[1:22:09] and one of the main things that you're
[1:22:11] liberated from is yourself it's a big
[1:22:16] one to get liberated from yourself and
[1:22:18] that really doesn't come to completion
[1:22:21] until you've got your glorified body
[1:22:23] right but you still get liberated from
[1:22:25] man the worst enemy you're carrying him
[1:22:30] around you know it's and and really that
[1:22:35] that's he's come to liberate us from
[1:22:37] that his Liberty will liberate you and
[1:22:41] has from demon possession demon
[1:22:44] oppression all complexes don't own any

[1:22:55] hallelujah
[1:22:56] actually so glad that complexes are
[1:23:00] leaving people amen that we're part of a
[1:23:04] group a church of believers where the
[1:23:07] resurrected Living God is delivering
[1:23:09] people from little tiny things stuff
[1:23:13] that you would find that people die with
[1:23:15] right people die with those things and
[1:23:18] have done for all over the last 2,000
[1:23:20] years Christians non-christians whatever
[1:23:23] they died in them
[1:23:25] Luther probably died full of complexes
[1:23:27] full of troubles troubled mind
[1:23:29] probably mental illness even I don't
[1:23:30] know yes he and he was used of God
[1:23:33] mightily and all these men and woman
[1:23:36] used of God mightily throughout all the
[1:23:38] ages died full of complexes to hide full
[1:23:42] of things in their lives that it wasn't
[1:23:44] the season for deliverance hallelujah
[1:23:48] they were there was not an expectation
[1:23:51] upon their life for a rector in faith
[1:23:55] there wasn't an expectation on their
[1:23:57] life for perfection to come into the
[1:24:01] full realization but there an eternal
[1:24:04] being part of God hallelujah
[1:24:07] it wasn't the expectation wasn't on them
[1:24:09] but God has placed an expectation on you
[1:24:12] now don't get burdened down by that
[1:24:14] because he'll also fulfill it he is
[1:24:17] fulfilling it hallelujah it is happening
[1:24:20] amen liberation
[1:24:23] liberation from all the tiniest little
[1:24:25] complexes that you think a tiny little
[1:24:27] tiny things someone did that you way
[1:24:29] back then and it's and you might think
[1:24:31] it's so small but it might be blocking a
[1:24:33] huge portion of heaven in your life it
[1:24:35] might be blocking a huge step in your
[1:24:38] life fears and stuff that you binds you
[1:24:41] down and out of balance
[1:24:44] emotional out of imbalances deliverance
[1:24:48] you can be delivered this morning if
[1:24:50] there's anything in your life this is

[1:25:00] risen amen it is the rising of the Sun
[1:25:04] you are the resurrection amen you're
[1:25:07] part of it aiming the resurrection is in
[1:25:10] you you see because of that because of
[1:25:13] the age we live in because of the season
[1:25:15] it is this is the season for the tiniest
[1:25:18] little things that you think is small he
[1:25:20] delivered he gives you Liberty from all
[1:25:24] those things no and like I said don't
[1:25:26] get condemned because you've got them
[1:25:28] still he doesn't you see God as long as
[1:25:32] when God puts his finger on something in
[1:25:35] your life that you say yes Lord Lord
[1:25:39] it's I want to deal with this I want
[1:25:42] freedom from this and you know what I'm
[1:25:44] going to stick on this Lord with you
[1:25:45] until I'm gone it's gone I'm not going
[1:25:48] to allow the devil to try and overwhelm
[1:25:50] me with all the other stuff and trying
[1:25:52] to confuse it that's one of us tactics
[1:25:54] you know God starts dealing with the
[1:25:56] small thing in your life and so what
[1:25:58] happens is you end up all these trials
[1:25:59] and the devil tries to take your
[1:26:00] attention off that and make you all
[1:26:03] overwhelmed by your own failures again
[1:26:05] and that thing gets lift again then you
[1:26:07] go around the mountain and around the
[1:26:09] mountain and around the mountain and
[1:26:10] keep going around and finally the trial
[1:26:12] comes again boom don't be distracted
[1:26:17] don't let the devil distract you you
[1:26:20] know and we're called to that we're
[1:26:22] called to be free from the tiniest
[1:26:24] little complexes and I and this is
[1:26:27] really what's happening in our day if we
[1:26:30] can allow God if we can take this word
[1:26:32] and embrace it with all of our hearts
[1:26:34] because you see God is speaking
[1:26:36] word to us he is speaking the very
[1:26:39] creative power creative power is coming
[1:26:43] over the pulpit creative power is coming
[1:26:45] out of the tapes creative power is
[1:26:48] coming out of our mouths
[1:26:49] amen hallelujah why because he's
[1:26:52] delivering us from complexes that have
[1:26:54] blocked it on all of our lives little
[1:26:56] things that you think is just I'll live
[1:26:59] with it
[1:26:59] don't live with it amen that's not
[1:27:03] heavenly culture hey man you know what
[1:27:05] heavenly caught perfection as purity as
[1:27:08] perfect faith as eternal life love Amen
[1:27:12] / pure perfect love amen no fears no
[1:27:17] imbalanced emotions he's delivering he
[1:27:21] gives us T from unfruitful Nastase
[1:27:24] achill e connected to everything's kind
[1:27:25] of interconnected but he gives us
[1:27:28] Liberty from unfruitful Ness he wants us
[1:27:31] to be fruitful amen and so that's why
[1:27:35] he's taking all these tiny little things
[1:27:37] and he's dealing with them and His grace
[1:27:39] and His mercy because those are the sort
[1:27:42] of things that stop us from being
[1:27:43] fruitful amen we can be doing a great
[1:27:47] work and it might not be doing much
[1:27:49] fruit but the work needs to have the
[1:27:52] fruit and if the work has the Holy Ghost
[1:27:55] the real Spirit of God manifesting forth
[1:27:58] himself it will have the fruit you know
[1:28:02] the tree of life were actually part of
[1:28:05] that you know we're part of the tree of
[1:28:07] life with a branch he's the vine and
[1:28:10] year the branches and what does he do
[1:28:13] he purchased that prunes it so that it
[1:28:17] becomes more fruitful hear me do you
[1:28:21] know the tree of knowledge is also got
[1:28:22] branch and that's the people that eat
[1:28:25] off the tree of knowledge and the people
[1:28:27] that do the will of Satan that is the
[1:28:30] tree of knowledge branches and he also
[1:28:32] has evil fruit but his fruit doesn't
[1:28:35] bring life it's a hybrid fruit it might
[1:28:38] plant a tree in a sea a hybrid seed will
[1:28:41] grow once or and the generation dies off
[1:28:44] after about three generations you know
[1:28:45] it just cannot continue on sometimes not
[1:28:49] even one generation
[1:28:50] sometimes it just doesn't grow anything
[1:28:51] but you know it's just but there is the
[1:28:55] two trees right there
[1:28:57] but God delivers us from unfruitful
[1:29:00] nurse his light shines on our lives to
[1:29:05] give us discernment to discern between
[1:29:08] the tree of knowledge and the Tree of
[1:29:10] Life to divide soul and spirit the
[1:29:14] joints and marrow to give us a
[1:29:16] discernment to be able to make judge
[1:29:18] righteous judgment amen and so it's so
[1:29:22] important and I encourage you listen to
[1:29:24] the tapes listen to the message amen
[1:29:28] every day put the message of brother
[1:29:31] Branham on your player put him in your
[1:29:34] phone put him put it everywhere listen
[1:29:37] to it you remember the story he was
[1:29:42] baptizing on the Ohio River in nineteen
[1:29:45] thirty six or seven or three I can't
[1:29:47] remember but one of those and that
[1:29:49] pillar of fire came down from heaven and
[1:29:52] said as john the baptist was sent to
[1:29:55] forerun first coming so I seen you with
[1:29:58] a message to 4-under second coming when
[1:30:01] I read that in my two weeks of being a
[1:30:05] Christian not even that maybe a week I
[1:30:09] knew from that moment that this is
[1:30:12] important I need it I need to hear this
[1:30:14] whenever this message is I want to
[1:30:17] become part of the me if this is for
[1:30:20] running the Second Coming
[1:30:21] then God has placed great emphasis great
[1:30:24] importance on my ears my eyes and heart
[1:30:28] and everything about me to receive that
[1:30:30] and I will do everything in my power to
[1:30:33] receive it when I first actually came
[1:30:38] after it because you know my story but
[1:30:40] so wit when I really gave my life to the
[1:30:42] Lord after I had had my little escapade
[1:30:44] and I gave my life to the Lord and I
[1:30:49] prayed and I prayed with all my heart
[1:30:52] Lord take everything out of me and I any
[1:30:56] knew that I was repenting he knew that I
[1:30:58] wanted to go and he gave me the Holy
[1:31:00] Ghost and you know what the first
[1:31:03] thing that happened to me was I got
[1:31:04] thirsty so thirsty and I couldn't wait
[1:31:08] to get the message just couldn't wait

[1:31:32] message you know I'm not saying you
[1:31:34] should go listen to the whole message
[1:31:35] but which you can I mean he wouldn't
[1:31:37] hurt you but you know I'm just saying
[1:31:39] this what I did because I had the time I

[1:31:42] was working in commercial jobs and I
[1:31:45] just had them an all day for four years
[1:31:47] just listening to the message and I was
[1:31:49] having a Jubilee a wonderful time

[1:33:45] it'll be gone I trust you trust me he
[1:33:49] knows when you ask and you want it gone
[1:33:50] for a hundred percent it's God how could
[1:33:54] it not for remember he gave every man a
[1:33:58] measure of faith every man a measure of
[1:34:01] faith so the people might tell you all I
[1:34:03] don't have faith to believe for that to
[1:34:04] go and you do have faith to believe they
[1:34:05] forgot you do have faith to make that go
[1:34:07] you got given it that there was lying to
[1:34:11] you he lies and he tells you you don't
[1:34:13] have faith but the God of heaven and His
[1:34:16] Word says I gave every man a measure of
[1:34:19] faith so you've got faith to be
[1:34:22] delivered from the tiny little things
[1:34:23] and the biggest giant things amen you've
[1:34:26] got faith to be delivered from a big
[1:34:28] giant tumor that might grow that big
[1:34:29] amen hallelujah
[1:34:31] disappear in this twinkling of an eye
[1:34:33] amen you have that faith that's already
[1:34:35] in you amen
[1:34:37] orys alert ago hey man said we'd be
[1:34:41] liberated amen
[1:34:43] from unfruitful news we've been
[1:34:45] liberated from casual Christianity amen
[1:34:49] we've been liberated from taking
[1:34:51] advantage of the Liberty of the Holy
[1:34:54] Ghost amen
[1:34:55] we don't want to do that that's not
[1:34:57] something that's not our portion our
[1:34:59] portion is fervency our portion is as
[1:35:02] being on fire for God however you
[1:35:05] express that as your individual
[1:35:07] personality but the the reality is we've
[1:35:11] been liberated from a wantonness we've
[1:35:13] been liberated from casualness and
[1:35:15] taking things so casually this whole
[1:35:18] Laodicean spirit is casual that's
[1:35:21] missing it's you know just just take it
[1:35:23] easy you know someone said that to
[1:35:25] someone someone the other day just take
[1:35:27] it easy or like really
[1:35:29] just take it all easy you know it's some
[1:35:32] like hippie like movement that you man
[1:35:36] take it easy man you know like it's not
[1:35:39] like this it's not really the Christian
[1:35:41] thing just to take it all easy and just
[1:35:44] relax and just cruise and just mix in
[1:35:47] and and don't offend anybody but you
[1:35:51] know God hasn't called us to that I'm
[1:35:53] not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[1:35:55] Christ which is the power of God unto
[1:35:57] salvation amen god help me to not be
[1:36:00] ashamed you know we don't want to be
[1:36:02] embarrassed by the things of God and
[1:36:04] this society has got such a pressure
[1:36:06] that just keeps going on the people to
[1:36:08] make what our confession is embarrassing
[1:36:11] to make someone that stands rugged for
[1:36:14] the truth for the objective truth not
[1:36:17] some apparent truthless this person's
[1:36:19] truth and netbiz are true there's only
[1:36:21] one truth there's only one real truth
[1:36:23] and that's Christianity hallelujah and
[1:36:26] so the the looming pressure and it's
[1:36:29] growing is that don't ever talk about
[1:36:32] someone else's religion as if it's not
[1:36:34] true their religion is true this is true
[1:36:37] that's true that's true what is that
[1:36:39] there's no foundation
[1:36:41] there's no eternal life in that but you
[1:36:44] see we need to be courageous to stand
[1:36:47] and make a stand and not be casual about
[1:36:51] it god help us you see he's liberated us
[1:36:55] from that too
[1:36:56] and you know what causes that the fear
[1:36:58] of men so here you see when he liberates
[1:37:01] us from the fear of men and that's one
[1:37:03] of my ones that I've really had trouble
[1:37:05] with is not the fear now when I say the
[1:37:08] fear of men that's the extreme of it but
[1:37:11] mine is more I don't like to upset or
[1:37:13] try I don't like making other people
[1:37:15] feel uncomfortable because my I love to
[1:37:18] make people feel comfortable you know I
[1:37:19] like to make people feel real welcoming
[1:37:21] and I like them to eat nicely and you
[1:37:24] know really pour it on people I love it
[1:37:27] and so the downside of that is I don't
[1:37:30] want to make people feel uncomfortable
[1:37:32] and even if it means telling them about
[1:37:34] something that they I know they're not
[1:37:36] going to like you know and opportunities
[1:37:38] have come in my life where I have any
[1:37:41] opportunity to tell them I'm like
[1:37:43] Oh part of me really wants to and then
[1:37:45] the other parts like you know what
[1:37:46] they're gonna be uncomfortable and they
[1:37:48] probably not even gonna like me and
[1:37:50] they're gonna leave and whatever because
[1:37:52] it's gonna it's going to basically tell
[1:37:53] them that everything that their life is
[1:37:55] built on is wrong and that's what it's
[1:37:57] like and so the pressure of the society
[1:37:59] is casual take it easy
[1:38:01] cruise mix say the right things don't
[1:38:06] upset people it's just over us you know
[1:38:10] and it doesn't have to be a part of us
[1:38:12] hey man you're a Goshen
[1:38:14] that's darkness it's all darkness all
[1:38:17] mixing together murky there's no solid
[1:38:19] definition but you see Jesus Christ his
[1:38:22] definition Amen the Word of God has
[1:38:25] definition it's a definite thing and we
[1:38:27] should be on fire for God and I believe
[1:38:30] that we've been liberated from from the
[1:38:32] dousing of Satan's poisonous water that
[1:38:34] puts the fire out amen
[1:38:36] because you see God himself has come in
[1:38:39] this generation with an open book in his
[1:38:40] hand a man do you know that open bookers
[1:38:43] if I had one now it's the fan amen
[1:38:45] hallelujah he's failing the fire amen
[1:38:48] he's taking their book and he's Fanning
[1:38:50] you know all those husks and everything
[1:38:51] is all falling off a man because he's
[1:38:54] bringing you making you ready for the
[1:38:55] threshing floor you know so he can
[1:38:57] gather the wheat into the garner and
[1:38:58] take you hallelujah up into the rapture
[1:39:01] amen so he the personal presence the
[1:39:05] Purusha of God is here amen
[1:39:08] he has come himself in a spirit form to
[1:39:11] fan the fire to deliver to abolish death
[1:39:15] I am the bread of life that cometh from
[1:39:19] God out of heaven when he said that here
[1:39:22] he was walking in the Corporal body he
[1:39:26] that eateth from me shall never die
[1:39:30] amen what happened in Revelation tip 13
[1:39:34] what happened hallelujah amen the same
[1:39:39] one now it wasn't corporal body now
[1:39:42] spiritual body King theophany I don't
[1:39:46] know if you've heard that expression
[1:39:47] before
[1:39:48] he's the king of our eternal bodies the
[1:39:52] king eternal body hallelujah the King
[1:39:55] angel the
[1:39:56] angel of the covenant with the rainbow
[1:39:57] about his head the face shining as a son
[1:39:59] a man what do to pierce through all the
[1:40:01] darkness pierce through all the clouds
[1:40:03] piercer all this murky casual
[1:40:06] christianity pierce Ruth's Babylonian
[1:40:09] religion so that you can take and eat
[1:40:14] the tree of life and live forever for in
[1:40:19] that and weird it is what was his
[1:40:21] dispensation who did he dispense it
[1:40:23] through he dispensed that whole thing
[1:40:25] through the Prophet through the seventh
[1:40:28] angel this you know that he was the
[1:40:31] vending machine if you can put it in
[1:40:33] terminology that we would kind of a
[1:40:36] parable that we would understand brother
[1:40:37] Branham was a vending machine for the
[1:40:40] Tree of Life
[1:40:41] now we don't pay for it amen that's free
[1:40:44] you just need to go up and you need to
[1:40:47] receive what God has for you hallelujah
[1:40:49] and so you see and I talked about this a
[1:40:52] bit earlier and maybe it's just coming
[1:40:53] back so now I can finish it I got so
[1:40:56] thirsty one day for this message I got
[1:41:01] so thirsty you know what that was I was
[1:41:05] speaking to Matthew about it the other
[1:41:07] day it was me fulfilling Revelation
[1:41:12] chapter 10 verse 8 which says and I
[1:41:14] heard another voice which speaketh from
[1:41:16] heaven I John the bride the individual
[1:41:20] now me and II I'm not John but I heard a
[1:41:25] voice which speaketh from heaven any man
[1:41:27] who's heard their voice oh you should be
[1:41:31] so thankful you've heard that voice one
[1:41:34] of their voice make you do Amen their
[1:41:37] voice lead you to feast on what those
[1:41:40] seven thunders spoke Amen that voice
[1:41:44] lead you gave you a thirst to take that
[1:41:48] book and eat it and you cannot be
[1:41:50] satisfied with anything else cannot go
[1:41:54] listen to some Benny Hinn or some tele
[1:41:56] evangelist it doesn't do it it has no
[1:42:00] value it has no I mean you probably feel
[1:42:02] good after listening to a sermon but it
[1:42:04] doesn't have that eternal hallmark of
[1:42:07] God
[1:42:08] now you listen to those tapes and you
[1:42:11] get thirsty because you heard their
[1:42:14] voice and you see you you come
[1:42:17] personally now to the Tree of Life who
[1:42:20] stands upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:42:21] they man what is he doing he's crushing
[1:42:25] down and taking dominion over Rome and
[1:42:27] over Hollywood which is the two lines
[1:42:29] the powers that rule this earth the
[1:42:32] powers and the influence that's killing
[1:42:34] this whole human race it's keeping them
[1:42:36] and also deceiving sons of God and
[1:42:42] you've been called very hand you've been
[1:42:48] called that's thirst in your life don't
[1:42:50] quench it with other things because it's
[1:42:52] very easy to quench that you can quench
[1:42:55] that thirst with other things small
[1:42:59] things busyness cultural and you see I
[1:43:03] told you being liberated from those
[1:43:04] things don't let anything else dictate
[1:43:07] to you but the feeding of the word
[1:43:10] should be more important to you than
[1:43:12] feeding of your mouth feeding your tummy
[1:43:16] amen
[1:43:17] I'm preaching to myself because everyone
[1:43:19] knows I like eating good we just praise
[1:43:23] the Lord Amen hallelujah so we've been
[1:43:26] delivered now and I'm sorry I probably
[1:43:28] didn't finish something but it will come
[1:43:31] back later but we've been delivered from
[1:43:34] cradle Christianity we've been liberated
[1:43:37] from casual Christianity hallelujah
[1:43:40] be not conformed to this world but be
[1:43:42] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:43:46] amen that you may know what is that good
[1:43:48] and acceptable will of God make we're
[1:43:54] only in the intro but that's right
[1:43:58] there's different Liberation's that I
[1:44:00] was looking into well these two more
[1:44:02] things we've deliberated from death
[1:44:04] we're liberated from death why I just
[1:44:07] spoke about it we are eating from the
[1:44:09] tree of life
[1:44:10] did you know that we're eating from the
[1:44:12] tree of life he came but open-book
[1:44:18] honest what is it the pure Word of God
[1:44:21] brother Branham said that the tree of
[1:44:24] knowledge of good and evil is a hybrid
[1:44:25] that's the scripture mixed with man's
[1:44:28] was the Satan's wisdom it's a hybrid
[1:44:30] tree all denominationalism all the
[1:44:34] revivals that God even raised up this is
[1:44:38] where it becomes you have to really put
[1:44:40] your spiritual thinking on here all the
[1:44:42] revivals of Luther Wesley Baptist
[1:44:44] everything all the denominational
[1:44:46] revivals that God was in was still not
[1:44:48] the Tree of Life it was a part of it but
[1:44:51] because they were in the revival and
[1:44:53] they were part of the restoration God
[1:44:55] blinked an eye at their ignorance and
[1:44:59] all of the things that there is against
[1:45:00] all the complexes in their life all all
[1:45:02] the sins that they were still practicing
[1:45:03] all of the funny doctrines and
[1:45:05] Babylonian thinking and all of that
[1:45:07] stuff that kicked them on the ground
[1:45:09] kept them on the ground
[1:45:11] they couldn't be wretched in that
[1:45:12] condition and even people that fail to
[1:45:15] receive the fullness of this message
[1:45:16] that follow the Prophet they believed
[1:45:19] he's a prophet
[1:45:20] they can't be raptured without coming
[1:45:22] into the former's and eating from that
[1:45:24] tree people that get scared of that
[1:45:26] mighty angel they don't eat from their
[1:45:27] open book that's where their rapturing
[1:45:30] is there's a netbook your rapturing
[1:45:33] faith has been contained in that book
[1:45:34] and this is a sensitive subject and I'll
[1:45:36] probably get some people if they watch
[1:45:39] it they probably talk to talk about it
[1:45:42] you know but as a sensitive subject
[1:45:44] because these people that claim brother
[1:45:45] Branham as a prophet but because of
[1:45:47] complexes or because they're looking
[1:45:50] towards another age they're not eating
[1:45:52] from that book out of the hands of an
[1:45:54] angel it's scared of their angel because
[1:45:57] it because of false teaching but
[1:46:02] we have been called to eat from that
[1:46:06] tree we have been called to eat from the
[1:46:09] tree of life and that is he is the
[1:46:12] abolish heir of death he has abolished
[1:46:15] death and that's why we've been
[1:46:19] delivered from death hallelujah and you
[1:46:23] but you can see how God was in all those
[1:46:26] revivals all the way through he was in
[1:46:29] them but it wasn't at all that mighty
[1:46:32] angel came down and there is the very
[1:46:37] liberation from everything when you're
[1:46:40] feeding on that you're getting liberated
[1:46:41] from things you wouldn't even know and
[1:46:43] you probably never will know think about
[1:46:46] that things in your life that you
[1:46:48] probably never even knew were there
[1:46:50] liberated and in these things that just
[1:46:53] require your conscious attention things
[1:46:55] that require a physical practice of some
[1:46:57] sort you know some sort of thing you've
[1:46:59] got to go and do or some amendment
[1:47:01] you've got to make with somebody or some
[1:47:03] forgiveness you've got to do Liberty
[1:47:06] this is Liberty day Saints and so I
[1:47:09] encourage you see you the kingdom of God
[1:47:14] first seek you first what is that
[1:47:18] kingdom where is that Kingdom manifested
[1:47:20] and they're open book they're open book
[1:47:24] now it does it has I need to have it I
[1:47:27] should have a Bible you know but I'm I
[1:47:29] am a Laodicean age but that open book
[1:47:35] that has got everything in it that we
[1:47:38] need that has got our Liberty in it
[1:47:41] everything's written in there our whole
[1:47:44] inheritance is written in there and
[1:47:46] here's the message of the hour I don't
[1:47:49] know how I got to the ER again but let's
[1:47:51] just come back now I want to talk about
[1:47:53] a couple of different forms of
[1:47:57] liberation that's happened in society is
[1:48:00] America's liberation America got
[1:48:04] liberated from free they got they'll be
[1:48:09] liberated to freedom of religion right
[1:48:11] but what happened to America is the same
[1:48:15] thing happened to is
[1:48:15] they took advantage of their liberty
[1:48:17] they took advantage of their choice
[1:48:19] because there wasn't a complete there
[1:48:23] was the promises you see the Devils so
[1:48:26] crafty he's so cunning to trick the
[1:48:31] people and what does he use e uses
[1:48:33] carnality and last tabata sness and he
[1:48:36] offers that other with with hybrid
[1:48:39] religion and what does it do it breaks
[1:48:41] the people it breaks their minds and
[1:48:43] breaks their it breaks the power of the
[1:48:46] Holy Ghost which is keeping the people
[1:48:47] so here's America they got liberated
[1:48:50] they got liberated to a new land and
[1:48:53] they had freedom of religion and now God
[1:48:57] was using that and building a nation but
[1:49:01] they took advantage of their liberty and
[1:49:03] look where they are now spiritually
[1:49:06] speaking in this the carnal woman's Lib
[1:49:11] who knows woman's Lib woman's Liberty
[1:49:14] now that wasn't woman's Liberty it was
[1:49:17] woman's bondage the devil twisted the
[1:49:21] minds of the people twisted the minds of
[1:49:26] females so what they were thinking was
[1:49:30] their liberation was actually their
[1:49:32] liberation from eternal life it was
[1:49:35] their liberation from their godly place
[1:49:37] a godly position their godly identity
[1:49:41] they got liberated all right but not for
[1:49:43] the right for it not for not not good
[1:49:45] Liberty but you see hallelujah
[1:49:48] you see that when the tree of knowledge
[1:49:50] goes does something the tree of life
[1:49:52] does something to there was also the
[1:49:54] there was another woman's liberation hey
[1:49:56] man hallelujah
[1:49:58] there was a Annalee clay Dee's
[1:50:01] liberation Amy she got liberated from
[1:50:04] Satan
[1:50:04] she got liberated from denominationalism
[1:50:07] she got liberated from Bennelong heaven
[1:50:11] hallelujah Amen why that makes me very
[1:50:17] happy
[1:50:21] then there was the Jewish liberation and
[1:50:23] man I watched some of those videos last
[1:50:24] night and it was sad man the Jewish
[1:50:27] liberation from all the camps Wow that
[1:50:31] was heavy
[1:50:32] real heavy Wow and the things that's it
[1:50:39] was just disheartening not just
[1:50:41] happening but just so heavy men Wow like
[1:50:44] the when they got liberated and those
[1:50:47] soldiers walked in you know they just
[1:50:49] the the people was like they were
[1:50:51] completely like immense at whatever you
[1:50:54] call it emaciated whatever you call it
[1:50:56] and just gone to net but they were just
[1:50:59] I couldn't believe it I you know and
[1:51:03] they just they were kissing the guards
[1:51:07] now kissing the soldiers and just
[1:51:09] hugging them and just couldn't believe
[1:51:11] it
[1:51:11] they were just so overwhelmed they were
[1:51:15] sentenced to death they all just gonna
[1:51:17] die they were all their families
[1:51:18] everything was just exterminated and
[1:51:21] they got liberated
[1:51:24] louia but there was only a natural
[1:51:26] Liberty it was only a natural liberation
[1:51:30] he is a far greater liberation from you
[1:51:36] see they got taken out of the
[1:51:38] concentration camp but the concentration
[1:51:41] camp didn't get taken out of him
[1:51:42] a lot of those people will even if
[1:51:45] they're still alive today
[1:51:46] they're just scarred because you see
[1:51:50] that the one that can take the liberate
[1:51:53] the concentration come out of a person
[1:51:55] they didn't receive they will their
[1:52:01] children will receive one day soon but
[1:52:08] you see my point we can be liberated
[1:52:11] from a circumstance we can be liberated
[1:52:15] from slavery we can be liberated from
[1:52:18] Egypt by a prophets message God can take
[1:52:21] you on the wings of a prophet the wings
[1:52:24] of an eagle and he can bring you out but
[1:52:28] what you need to be very certain of God
[1:52:31] about
[1:52:33] has Egypt been taken out of you has the
[1:52:36] slave mentality gone has that culture
[1:52:39] gone has that casual Christianity gone
[1:52:42] has that all of those things of Babylon
[1:52:45] and all the traits that everything that
[1:52:47] slave mentality has that been taken out
[1:52:50] are you allowing God to take those
[1:52:51] things away are you allowing God to work
[1:52:54] on the deep parts of your life amen
[1:52:58] what what's God put his finger on in
[1:53:02] your life what is this finger on right
[1:53:05] now give it to him
[1:53:07] lay it down because you see that it'll
[1:53:09] be that's just the just a little thing
[1:53:11] maybe I had lay it down because you see
[1:53:20] sometimes it's those little things that
[1:53:22] hold a big thing so just lay it all down
[1:53:28] be an open book you are what you eat
[1:53:32] they what are you eating amen
[1:53:36] are you eating the open book you are
[1:53:40] what you eat you become a reflection of

[1:54:03] reading a title deed that says that
[1:54:05] person owns this they might not know it
[1:54:07] but they're reading ownership theory
[1:54:11] they're reading this person's gonna rule
[1:54:13] and reign with Christ a thousand years
[1:54:14] and then all for eternity hallelujah
[1:54:18] amen it makes me very happy to think so
[1:54:23] when you're getting down and when you're
[1:54:24] getting a pressed and when you're

[1:54:28] fiery trial one you're getting liberated

[1:54:41] that caused the fires of Babylon to
[1:54:42] engulf you because you're a fellowship
[1:54:46] with
[1:54:46] mighty captain amen because you're in
[1:54:49] fellowship with him this morning because
[1:54:53] you were eating from his hand directly

[1:55:25] of it all but the fellowship that you
[1:55:28] are having the book that you're eating
[1:55:31] the title deed that's in your possession
[1:55:34] that title deed says you don't smell
[1:55:37] like the smoke that title D says you are
[1:55:39] free that title Z says you're on fire

[1:55:44] rapturing faith in your life hallelujah
[1:55:47] that title seat says you have dominion
[1:55:49] you are a co here with Christ amen
[1:55:52] that's what it says that's what you're

[1:55:58] because I'm reading it out of you amen

[1:57:01] a place where even my enemies let alone
[1:57:05] my brethren to say they can say nothing
[1:57:08] been somebody that you know you could go
[1:57:14] to war with and they wouldn't let you
[1:57:16] down
[1:57:16] they wouldn't flip you know that's a
[1:57:19] soldier's terminology flapping and it's
[1:57:22] that's when it all gets heated on and
[1:57:24] the heat goes on and it gets real high
[1:57:26] pressure and you stay you have that mean
[1:57:30] you just you strong stay with your
[1:57:34] comrades your whistle comrades

[1:58:22] us that's our whole life this is the
[1:58:27] vision you know I can't describe how
[1:58:30] blessed we are and I'm sure you know
[1:58:34] this is a blessed Fellowship amen I'd
[1:58:38] like to have Church every day Amen
[1:58:42] hallelujah let's just quit our jobs and
[1:58:45] have churchy amen
[1:58:47] we'll grow gardens now amen sing songs
[1:58:53] mate will have the Babylonian Empire
[1:58:56] after us for sure they don't want us to
[1:59:01] do that you know there's people that
[1:59:03] actually try and live off the land or
[1:59:04] let and they actually cut it illegal
[1:59:06] these laws that they have to do this
[1:59:10] very strict
[1:59:10] cause if you want to live off the land
[1:59:12] and be completely separated from the
[1:59:15] government and the economy and all that
[1:59:17] stuff actually I will earn it you'd
[1:59:20] never think it and they probably are
[1:59:22] countries you can't do it because they
[1:59:23] don't have much but in a country like
[1:59:25] this you have to fight to live off the
[1:59:28] land you have to pay taxes and I don't
[1:59:32] know what they charge you for but mate
[1:59:34] you got to pay for probably soil taxes
[1:59:36] but you actually you can't just do that
[1:59:40] and that really is pressure sits here
[1:59:46] and we're closing very shortly
[1:59:50] Romans 6:4 brethren oh sorry what shall
[1:59:54] we say then shall we continue in sin
[1:59:56] that grace may abound god forbid how
[1:59:59] shall we that are dead to sin live any
[2:00:01] longer therein see when you really die
[2:00:05] to yourself you die to that ambush you
[2:00:08] die to all about everything everything
[2:00:11] tiny little thing just now that doesn't
[2:00:16] mean you're not gonna do anything in
[2:00:18] your life anymore God will give you back
[2:00:20] it's just being willing to land or it's
[2:00:24] being willing to say no you know what
[2:00:26] whatever you want look whatever you want
[2:00:29] that's when he can really do a
[2:00:32] successful work in your life
[2:00:33] and without that forsaking all you'll
[2:00:37] never really be a successful Christian
[2:00:40] you won't have a successful walk with
[2:00:43] God there will always be a battle
[2:00:45] there'll always be a turmoil there'll
[2:00:48] always be hybrid thinking they'll always
[2:00:50] be tossed to and fro and stability but
[2:00:55] instability but stability comes from a
[2:01:00] complete surrender to the Word of God
[2:01:04] death to self totally did
[2:01:08] one hundred percent not ninety eight to
[2:01:11] see the wife is bound by the law as long
[2:01:15] as her husband lives but if her husband
[2:01:17] be dead she is at liberty I mean I like
[2:01:21] that she is at liberty to be married
[2:01:24] to whom she will only in the Lord now i
[2:01:29] spiritualize this and I believe that the
[2:01:32] Paul was here as well there is a natural
[2:01:35] connotation to it but the wife is bound
[2:01:39] to her old nature the bride was bound to
[2:01:44] her old nature as long as Sheila but if
[2:01:48] she be dead she is at liberty to be
[2:01:53] married to Jesus Christ to be married to
[2:01:58] the true husband the true grace full of
[2:02:02] grace and truth
[2:02:03] hallelujah I can't help but think of
[2:02:08] Rahab you know she she was married to
[2:02:10] her old life and all her old husbands
[2:02:14] and everyone all in their life and she
[2:02:18] was a prostitute as she was stuck in her
[2:02:20] life and all the witnesses against her
[2:02:22] but one day a mighty captain descended
[2:02:26] down from heaven and his mission they
[2:02:29] made his mission statement was I want
[2:02:34] that woman free he didn't say that
[2:02:36] directly but that's what happened so
[2:02:38] that was his mission his mission was to
[2:02:42] free Rahab hallelujah
[2:02:44] a prostitute someone that was married to
[2:02:46] all these things and stuck his mission
[2:02:50] was to set her free
[2:02:51] she didn't do anything to all she did
[2:02:55] was believe she received the tape
[2:02:57] ministry amen she received the two spies
[2:03:00] that came in with some tapes and gave
[2:03:02] her some tapes a man if she listened to
[2:03:03] the wood hallelujah and she she she she
[2:03:07] surrendered she later all all that old
[2:03:11] life she laid it all down completely
[2:03:16] laid it down and what does she get Amen
[2:03:20] hallelujah she stood there while the
[2:03:23] grace of God while the mighty angel the
[2:03:25] open book open the seven seals open the
[2:03:28] word open the seals and and and the army
[2:03:31] of the law of the ministry
[2:03:33] Joshua brother Branham came in and
[2:03:35] released the word
[2:03:37] and they obeyed in the church did it
[2:03:41] stink preach the seven seals seven times
[2:03:44] and the day at the evening of the
[2:03:46] seventh day where are we the evening of
[2:03:48] the seventh day we're right there the
[2:03:53] captain has an intention he wants us to
[2:03:56] be completely liberated from everything
[2:04:01] that ties us to this earth
[2:04:02] Rahab stands there and all around her
[2:04:07] normally I shouting with her fish like
[2:04:09] this but this is just their nice quiet
[2:04:12] one and it all just crumbles she doesn't
[2:04:16] have any part to play in that
[2:04:17] deliverance she just she just came under
[2:04:21] the subjection to the word believe the
[2:04:24] word came under subjection to the word
[2:04:26] and watched her whole life be
[2:04:30] annihilated around here crumble down by
[2:04:33] the power of that opening of the word
[2:04:35] hallelujah and what happens she married
[2:04:39] the captain a man she married the
[2:04:41] natural captain you see but this is the
[2:04:45] glorious thing about Jesus he was
[2:04:47] writing a prophecy right there he was
[2:04:50] writing a prophecy because he knew that
[2:04:52] one day when the when the Rahab of 2017
[2:04:57] would be freed from her bondage and
[2:05:00] sinning or mm I mean we've all been you
[2:05:03] know we're kind of stretched out over
[2:05:04] the last however many years I won't go
[2:05:07] there and we prophesy because you see
[2:05:13] right around it's right here
[2:05:16] all crumbles away Babylon the influence
[2:05:20] of Babylon all of the little things that
[2:05:23] Babylon offers you Babylon offers us a
[2:05:26] lot Satan offers the human race so many
[2:05:30] things all sorts of little trinkets and
[2:05:33] all sorts of little substances and all
[2:05:34] sorts of little things that seem so
[2:05:36] glittery and nice and tasty and whatever
[2:05:39] it may be all of that crumbles away
[2:05:45] because the people could tap into a
[2:05:48] celestial joy they tap into the creator
[2:05:52] that created joy that created all the
[2:05:55] chemicals in your body that make you
[2:05:57] feel joy physically as well when you
[2:06:00] have him in there with Christ on the
[2:06:02] vessel I can smile at the store with
[2:06:05] Christ in the vessel you know it's such
[2:06:06] a simple thing but man it's a powerful
[2:06:09] statement with Christ than the vessel
[2:06:11] abbot Christ's coming into every vessel
[2:06:15] you see when we met when that word
[2:06:18] opened in our generation and all under
[2:06:25] our feet I'll just drop the drop listen
[2:06:30] hear that mighty angel that stood on the
[2:06:32] sea and upon the earth he comes down
[2:06:34] right over us comes into our life and he

[2:09:03] the Swiss Army was having trouble with
[2:09:07] the Germans I think it was and Swiss
[2:09:11] alike you know they're not a big
[2:09:12] spaceship back in those days probably
[2:09:14] not a very big nation and they had they
[2:09:16] didn't have advanced technology I don't
[2:09:19] even know what year it was but anyway it
[2:09:21] was it was in the olden days and the
[2:09:27] Germans come to attack Switzerland you
[2:09:29] don't take the land and whatever they
[2:09:30] did or whatever it was the out there
[2:09:33] another country was coming to attack
[2:09:34] them and they had advanced weapons and
[2:09:36] everything and they were going to like
[2:09:38] the odds were Switzerland was going down
[2:09:40] basically and this one man Arnold von
[2:09:44] wenk Lud he said he they're all
[2:09:46] gathering around and they're gathering
[2:09:48] together and and they're ready to
[2:09:50] basically saying their last prayers you
[2:09:52] know they're all dying they're going and
[2:09:55] [Music]
[2:09:56] and Arnold bond went Claude says all
[2:09:59] right everybody today I die for
[2:10:03] Switzerland and and basically he said
[2:10:07] please just tell my wife and my child
[2:10:09] Bern they won't see me again today I die
[2:10:13] force what's a little and then when
[2:10:16] they're already and the armies there and
[2:10:18] the armies there because they meant on a
[2:10:19] neutral ground to fight and all of a
[2:10:23] sudden our old von whant Clark just runs
[2:10:26] and he charges and he says make way for
[2:10:28] liberty make way for Liberty and he gave
[2:10:33] his life for the liberty of his nation

[2:10:40] make way for Liberty by giving your life
[2:10:44] by laying it completely on the altar of
[2:10:47] God as a living sacrifice living
[2:10:51] sacrifice not physically give your life
