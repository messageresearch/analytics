[28:40] amongst other believers and it's a
[28:42] special occasion as well
[28:45] ben and christine bring william benjamin
[28:48] gloin to be dedicated to the lord
[28:51] it's a wonderful thing if parents do
[28:53] that
[28:54] not every parent does that
[28:58] there is a lot of babies sprinkled in
[29:02] the world
[29:03] you know not understanding the
[29:05] scriptures
[29:06] but uh there is a scripture in the bible
[29:09] i like to read
[29:10] first where
[29:13] jesus said oh bless the children mark 10
[29:18] verses 13 to 16 and they brought
[29:22] young children to him that he should
[29:25] touch them
[29:26] and his disciples rebuked those that
[29:29] brought him
[29:30] brought them but when jesus saw it he
[29:32] was much displeased
[29:35] and said unto them suffer the little
[29:38] children to come unto me
[29:40] and forbid them not for such is the
[29:42] kingdom of god
[29:44] verily i say unto you whosoever shall
[29:47] not receive the kingdom of god as a
[29:50] little child
[29:51] he shall not enter therein and he took
[29:54] them up in his arms
[29:56] put his hands upon them and blessed them
[30:00] that's what the lord did you know the
[30:03] disciples rebuked him
[30:05] just before before
[30:08] he dedicated or blessed the children
[30:13] he was preaching on
[30:16] people not to commit adultery not to put
[30:19] their wives away not to put their
[30:20] husbands away he preached on that
[30:23] and the disciples thought here come
[30:25] little children oh we talk about
[30:27] errol stuff you know what's that got to
[30:29] do with it that's why they rebuked him i
[30:31] believe
[30:32] they said now it's no part but you see
[30:35] the bible says
[30:36] let young and old worship the lord
[30:38] together
[30:40] and you know children are as much part
[30:41] of everything
[30:43] as the older ones and i've heard
[30:46] myself many many young
[30:50] people or when they were older
[30:53] remembering
[30:54] when there were children who treated
[30:56] them nice and who didn't
[30:59] amen let's just uh
[31:02] read one little quote here
[31:08] uh now they brought children and
[31:12] infants to jesus that he might put his
[31:14] hands upon them
[31:15] and bless them now we are not jesus
[31:19] but do this in representation of him
[31:22] i believe that if jesus will be standing
[31:26] here this morning
[31:28] that you would bring william
[31:31] to him amen to be blessed
[31:34] so to dedicate your child to the lord
[31:36] publicly
[31:37] i believe it's like we we had our own
[31:40] baptism
[31:41] a public declaration we believe in the
[31:44] lord
[31:45] and that's what ben and christine are
[31:48] doing this morning
[31:49] bring william benjamin gloin
[31:52] to be part of the family of god and to
[31:55] dedicate him to the lord
[31:58] can we just um perhaps pray together
[32:01] and
[32:07] let's just pray heavenly father this
[32:10] morning we come
[32:12] humbly before they we know that you are
[32:15] the creator of all things you
[32:17] have given william benjamin
[32:20] to christine and ben to be part of their
[32:23] family
[32:25] and lord they want him to grow up
[32:27] knowing you
[32:28] knowing the power of god knowing the
[32:30] anointing of god
[32:32] we just pray and dedicate him into your
[32:35] kingdom into your hands we pray that you
[32:38] would
[32:38] just bless him that he would direct him
[32:41] amen and lord should he tarry that he
[32:43] would find you
[32:44] at a young age which is pray also your
[32:48] blessings
[32:49] upon chris dean and benjamin
[32:52] that they direct and guide and lead the
[32:56] children
[32:57] according to your word just pray please
[32:59] grant them
[33:00] wisdom and good health and strength
[33:04] and ask your blessings upon the family
[33:06] especially upon william in jesus
[33:08] christ's name amen
[33:10] amen amen amen
[33:14] amen amen
[33:16] [Applause]
[33:20] thank you very much oh no if you want to
[33:22] lead us in a song have your liberty
[33:23] brother
[33:24] is going to preach the word of god to us
[33:25] this morning i believe he has the lord's
[33:27] put something on his heart for all of us
[33:29] amen so god bless you have you lived
[33:30] could we just start doing some more
[33:32] whatever you'd like to do all right
[33:37] let's get straight into it
[33:38] [Laughter]
[33:40] um i'll read one scripture while we
[33:42] stand
[33:44] um i've got
[33:47] first john
[33:51] 5 verse 4
[33:54] first john verse chapter 5 verse 4
[33:57] and i'll read it out of the amplified
[33:59] bible which is
[34:00] uh highlights a bit more
[34:04] for everyone born of god is victorious
[34:08] and overcomes the world and this is the
[34:12] victory
[34:12] that has conquered and overcome the
[34:15] world
[34:16] our continuing persistent faith
[34:20] in jesus the son of god amen you may be
[34:23] seated
[34:29] everyone born of god is victorious and
[34:32] overcomes the world
[34:34] that's a condition you see to be
[34:37] victorious
[34:39] and to be victorious to overcome the
[34:42] world
[34:43] you know it doesn't mean much to a lot
[34:45] of people what
[34:46] that scripture overcome the world what's
[34:49] what's to overcome
[34:50] but for a christian for a believer
[34:54] we have to overcome what is
[34:57] anti-christ what is anti-god and we live
[35:00] in a day
[35:01] like never ever before so close to the
[35:05] coming of the lord
[35:06] and the bible talks about how
[35:11] there's a great falling away i know we
[35:14] see it all around us
[35:15] i don't know about you but i've been
[35:17] around for a little while now
[35:19] and i've seen things change so much
[35:22] and so rapidly what
[35:26] when i was young you would have thought
[35:28] no
[35:29] it's impossible that never would happen
[35:31] you know the most incredible things
[35:33] but now it's happening right around us
[35:36] we live right at the end
[35:38] of time and to me it's exciting to some
[35:42] it's frightening but
[35:43] it's exciting for the believer it's not
[35:46] a frightening thing
[35:47] because he's gave us power to overcome
[35:50] these things so we can stand at the day
[35:53] of christ
[35:54] and in him we can stand sure so
[35:58] we we know there is not everybody's a
[36:01] believer there's
[36:02] as much there is a a great falling away
[36:05] there's
[36:05] i think a great drawing closer to god
[36:08] and i want to be in that group
[36:11] drawing closer to him and closer to his
[36:14] word
[36:14] recognizing his word and stay with it no
[36:17] matter what happens around us
[36:20] so there only be two
[36:23] two types of people at the end you know
[36:25] like
[36:27] you know the the story of uh
[36:30] the titanic when the titanic sank
[36:34] when they boarded the plane at the plane
[36:36] the the boat
[36:38] there was a whole lot of different
[36:40] people there was
[36:41] rich people famous people there were
[36:44] poor people
[36:45] down below on the lowest deck and there
[36:49] was
[36:49] all sorts of people there were men
[36:52] there were women there were children but
[36:55] when the boat sank
[36:57] there was only the deed and the living
[37:00] the survivors
[37:02] and the lost amen and so is in the last
[37:05] day
[37:05] there only be the believers
[37:09] those that are saved and the unbelievers
[37:12] which go to perdition you know there's
[37:14] not this group this and this group there
[37:17] it's only one or the other so
[37:21] we are at the end there is the
[37:23] overcomers and there's the lost
[37:28] now with the decline of um
[37:32] of the world and what we see outside
[37:36] there is there is uh also more
[37:40] persecution towards the christians i'm
[37:42] just
[37:43] putting these things out so we we see
[37:45] where we're going
[37:47] and don't be surprised don't be
[37:50] surprised
[37:51] i remember even here um many years ago
[37:56] i went to a meeting in gisborne
[38:00] and the pastor was saying how the
[38:03] council and the people appreciate
[38:05] we are christians and all these things
[38:07] but those days are gone
[38:09] they don't appreciate being a christian
[38:12] they start to hate you they start to
[38:15] work against you
[38:16] they start to say bad things about you
[38:20] they want to put you in a bad light they
[38:23] want to put you in with all the extreme
[38:26] whatever goes on but it's not like that
[38:29] anymore
[38:30] it's getting worse and worse
[38:33] but it gets closer and closer to their
[38:36] time and when you see these things look
[38:38] up they've redemption drawers nice
[38:40] that's what it
[38:40] is so there's bless for me
[38:44] my wife was just telling me the other
[38:46] day she was uh
[38:48] going somewhere in the car and the radio
[38:50] was on and there was some
[38:53] talk back or something but there was
[38:56] all this blasphemy against god and
[39:00] against christians
[39:01] you see when it's against god it's
[39:03] against you
[39:04] because you identify with the
[39:06] representation of him
[39:08] so don't be upset just rejoice when you
[39:11] see these things
[39:13] so we can overcome these things by the
[39:16] power of god
[39:17] and by his word
[39:21] now it will get more extreme
[39:26] the most extreme is actually during the
[39:28] tribulation itself
[39:30] which i believe the christians will not
[39:32] go through
[39:33] but some will go through i just like to
[39:36] read you
[39:37] a few scriptures here
[39:41] revelation 3 21 to him that overcometh
[39:44] will i grant to sit with me
[39:46] in my throne even as i also
[39:49] became and i'm sit down with my father
[39:53] in his throne
[39:54] so to him that overcomes there are
[39:57] people that will overcome
[40:01] you know sometimes you see great big
[40:03] problems and you think no it's not
[40:05] possible
[40:06] all things are possible everything you
[40:08] can overcome
[40:09] with the power of god there's nothing
[40:12] impossible you get into situations in
[40:16] life
[40:16] and you think there's no way out
[40:19] especially
[40:20] if a pile of bills or something no way
[40:24] you know i earned so much a week and
[40:26] this and if i sell that
[40:28] no way i can get there but the way the
[40:31] lord makes a way
[40:33] i've experienced it myself many times
[40:35] but uh
[40:37] we are overcomers we believe in
[40:39] overcoming
[40:40] revelations 12 11 and they overcame him
[40:44] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[40:46] of their testimony
[40:47] and they loved not their lives unto the
[40:50] death
[40:52] so there is overcoming
[40:55] by believing in christ
[40:58] in a power of the blood and testify of
[41:01] it
[41:02] it's important to witness of it now we
[41:06] go
[41:08] and read a few scriptures about the lost
[41:12] i'd just like you to put you in the
[41:14] picture here
[41:15] revelations 9 16 to 21
[41:18] and the number of the army of the
[41:19] horsemen were two hundred thousand
[41:22] thousand and i heard the number of them
[41:26] and thus i saw the horses in the vision
[41:30] and them that set up on them having the
[41:32] breastplate of fire
[41:34] and of chest sin and brimstone
[41:38] and the heads of the horses were as the
[41:40] heads of lions
[41:42] and out of their mouth issued fire and
[41:44] smoke
[41:45] and brimstone by these
[41:48] three was the third part of the man
[41:51] killed
[41:52] of men killed by the fire and by the
[41:55] smoke
[41:56] and by the brimstone which issued out of
[41:58] their mouth
[42:00] for their power is in their mouth and in
[42:02] their tails
[42:04] for their tails were like unto serpents
[42:06] and their heads
[42:07] and with them they do hurt now listen to
[42:10] this
[42:11] and the rest of the men which were not
[42:14] killed
[42:15] by these plagues yet repented not
[42:18] of the works of their hands you would
[42:20] think if these things happen you start
[42:22] to
[42:23] repent and seek god and say look
[42:26] something
[42:26] now they hate him more and more and more
[42:29] and even if they say the hand of god
[42:31] they don't
[42:32] want it you see that that's what happens
[42:36] to people and said and
[42:37] that they should not worship devils and
[42:39] idols of gold and
[42:40] silver and brass and stone and of wood
[42:42] which neither can see nor hear
[42:44] no walk you see neither repent the day
[42:49] of their murders nor of their sorceries
[42:52] nor of their fornication nor of their
[42:54] theft
[42:56] they harden the heart more and more and
[42:58] more
[42:59] and once people go that way they hate
[43:02] god so much
[43:03] they can't even receive christ or mercy
[43:05] that they don't want it
[43:07] they don't want it they say oh what is
[43:09] god yeah
[43:10] i've met people like that you witnessed
[43:12] to them i went into a man about six
[43:14] months ago
[43:16] and he was uh dying of cancer
[43:20] and i thought i like to encourage him
[43:23] that there's hope
[43:25] and some of you may know but
[43:30] quite a few years ago now our neighbor
[43:32] he was
[43:33] dying of cancer he was 85 years old
[43:37] he was i went to see him
[43:41] hardly recognizable just a skeleton
[43:44] any pain in agony and he said
[43:48] the doctor gave me two weeks to live
[43:52] but i don't think i might get that long
[43:56] and i said it then he said well i can't
[43:59] do a thing about it
[44:01] i said well all i know is what this word
[44:04] says
[44:05] so i told him about it and he got
[44:08] nervous
[44:10] and kind of dismissed me but rang me
[44:13] back one and a half hours later
[44:16] can you come and talk to me so i went
[44:19] back
[44:20] and then first he explained how the
[44:22] pains got worse
[44:24] and different and i said look i'm not a
[44:26] doctor but i can tell you what the bible
[44:28] says
[44:29] i said a cancer has a life and that
[44:32] life's not of god
[44:34] and the lord said lay hands on the sick
[44:36] they recover cast out demons
[44:38] and i said to him i can pray for you but
[44:41] you have to have faith
[44:43] he said oh i have faith he's never been
[44:46] in church
[44:47] he said i have faith i laid my hand on
[44:50] him
[44:51] asked the lord to forgive me sins then i
[44:54] told satan to leave him
[44:58] i said amen and you know i didn't think
[45:01] of anything
[45:02] there was no great fire come down from
[45:05] heaven
[45:06] you know it was half a minute late he
[45:09] said
[45:10] pains are going away you know he was
[45:13] totally healed he died 90 years old
[45:17] of old age not of cancer you see that
[45:20] is the power of god
[45:23] that is his word now i was telling this
[45:28] man
[45:28] trying to encourage him and
[45:32] that there's hope i couldn't even get
[45:35] started with the testimony
[45:37] yeah i said look we always can prayer
[45:40] prayer get away with that rubbish that
[45:43] god
[45:44] rubbish and he blasted me he almost
[45:47] attacked me
[45:49] and i thought well i walked away
[45:52] never seen him since i think he died but
[45:55] you see
[45:56] there are people they get so hardened
[45:58] towards god
[46:00] you just can't do a thing with them but
[46:02] there are people that
[46:03] never really heard of the power of god
[46:06] and they believe it if they come across
[46:08] it
[46:08] so there's still people around so
[46:12] in the book of revelation many
[46:13] scriptures uh
[46:16] 69 it said and men were scorched
[46:20] with great heat and blasphemed the name
[46:23] of god
[46:24] which has power over these plagues and
[46:27] they repented not to give him glory
[46:30] see you have those groups
[46:33] and in chapter 16 verses 10 11 says
[46:37] and the fifth angel poured out his vial
[46:40] upon the seat of the beast
[46:44] and his kingdom was full of darkness and
[46:46] they knew
[46:47] their tongues for pain and blasphemed
[46:50] the god
[46:50] of heaven because of their pains and
[46:53] their souls
[46:54] and repented not of their deeds
[46:58] what's got that to do with it i can do
[47:00] what i want you see
[47:01] people don't realize god gave his word
[47:04] for a reason
[47:05] it was for our protection not to curse
[47:08] us
[47:09] but if people don't want that they still
[47:13] they're lord so the believers will
[47:16] overcome
[47:16] and be victorious
[47:20] because we don't belong to this world
[47:23] we belong to the kingdom of god you know
[47:26] we we don't have to fight for the
[47:28] kingdom down here
[47:29] we can make a stand and call things
[47:31] wrong and call things which are right
[47:33] right
[47:34] but we are not fighting for this kingdom
[47:37] because we don't belong to it
[47:39] and you know you feel like an alien more
[47:41] and more in this world
[47:43] when when you stay with a word you don't
[47:45] even have to change
[47:48] i i remember years ago i said to my
[47:49] mother she said you're so extreme
[47:53] i said no mother i'm not extreme you're
[47:55] so extreme far away from the truth
[47:57] that's what it is and even if you don't
[48:01] change if you just stay as you are
[48:04] if it goes on the same way in 10 years
[48:06] you're extreme
[48:08] definitely you become extreme
[48:11] and then you now consider one of those
[48:15] extreme fundamental christians
[48:19] all right now i read you
[48:22] john 15 verses 19 to 21
[48:27] if you were of the world the world would
[48:29] love his own but because you are not of
[48:31] the world
[48:32] but i have chosen you out of the world
[48:35] therefore the world hates you
[48:37] remember the world that is
[48:41] the word that i said unto you the
[48:42] servant is not greater than his lord
[48:45] if they have persecuted me they will
[48:47] also persecute you
[48:48] but if they have kept my saying they
[48:52] will keep yours also
[48:55] but all these things will they do unto
[48:57] you for my name's sake because they
[49:00] know not him that sent me
[49:05] so there is it's a twofold thing
[49:09] if they hate god they will hate you too
[49:13] if you give a true true signal of who
[49:15] you are
[49:16] if you show your colors they will hate
[49:18] you too
[49:21] but if they hear you
[49:25] they'll hear you as they would have
[49:27] heard god himself
[49:29] so there is a great big responsibility
[49:32] and the great big well said this way he
[49:35] says
[49:36] if they have kept my saying they will
[49:38] keep yours also
[49:40] so whether it's jesus saying are you
[49:41] saying the truth they will
[49:43] listen to it and all that extra oh it's
[49:47] only him or her or or a child told me
[49:50] you know
[49:50] don't need to listen to that or he
[49:53] doesn't come to our church you don't
[49:54] need to hear him
[49:55] no that's wrong we hear him if he speaks
[49:59] through his children now john 3
[50:02] 13 to 15 says
[50:06] a no man has ascended up to heaven but
[50:09] he that came down from heaven
[50:12] even the son of man which is in heaven
[50:15] and as moses lifted up the serpent in
[50:17] the wilderness even so much the son of
[50:18] man be lifted up
[50:20] that whosoever believes them in him
[50:22] should not perish but have eternal life
[50:25] so our eyes are towards christ
[50:29] that's that's what it really comes to
[50:31] our eyes are towards christ
[50:33] who pay the price for our salvation we
[50:35] know where we're going we know we've
[50:37] been forgiven
[50:38] we know he filled us with the holy ghost
[50:40] we know we're part of him we're sons and
[50:42] daughters of god
[50:43] so there's no fear of what's going on
[50:47] around us
[50:48] and it's getting worse honestly it's
[50:51] getting worse some people
[50:53] get quite fearful concerned you know
[50:58] but there's no fear we're a spiritual
[51:00] lord is this casted out of fear
[51:04] so if you're in the presence of god all
[51:06] fear leaves you
[51:07] all worries leave you all concerns leave
[51:10] you
[51:11] let's just go enter into their presence
[51:14] that's what it comes to
[51:15] we can see it's happening around us
[51:20] and praise god for eyes that can see
[51:23] you know it's that's a tremendous thing
[51:26] if you can actually see
[51:29] if you don't see you just get swallowed
[51:31] up with the rest
[51:32] if you don't see it some people just
[51:34] don't see it
[51:35] i don't think it's that bad you know
[51:37] that there's
[51:39] it's terrible did you know brother
[51:42] branham
[51:42] said 60 all the years ago
[51:46] it he thought it can't get any worse
[51:50] you know in the 60s you know you had
[51:54] had a bit of things going on but it was
[51:58] not like now men wouldn't marry men and
[52:02] women wouldn't marry women
[52:04] for instance you wouldn't have all that
[52:06] nonsense and you thought
[52:07] it couldn't get any worse it is
[52:11] so bad now and a lot of people don't see
[52:14] it
[52:14] you know you're born into this world as
[52:16] a child
[52:18] you think it's all all normal because
[52:20] you don't
[52:21] see it you taught yeah you know the
[52:24] children who were born in sodom
[52:26] they didn't think it was all that bad
[52:29] they didn't think so
[52:31] the lord had to open people's eyes yeah
[52:35] you know it's it's it's important to
[52:37] rejoice in the fact when you can
[52:39] actually see
[52:41] that's a gift of god eyes to see
[52:44] eyes to see and many many
[52:48] don't see what's going on they just
[52:50] blindly
[52:51] walk into it i always remem
[52:54] remember that example when when uh
[52:58] i went for once in spain and
[53:01] yeah you know when you eat your meal if
[53:04] it's
[53:04] dim light if you haven't got much light
[53:07] you don't actually exactly see what you
[53:09] eat
[53:10] when you turn the light on and you see
[53:12] the little bugs in the salad on this and
[53:14] the other
[53:15] so let's have light let's not be
[53:19] ignorant about these things
[53:21] let's have the light and say that's i'm
[53:23] not eating this
[53:24] i'm not having this i'm having the real
[53:26] stuff
[53:28] so i just like to read you a few more
[53:31] scriptures and then i'll come to
[53:33] what sort of struck me um
[53:37] well known second timothy 3
[53:40] 1-5 this know also that in the last days
[53:45] perilous times shall come perilous
[53:48] for men shall be lovers of their own
[53:50] selves
[53:52] what do you mean lovers of their own
[53:54] selves
[53:57] you know a few years ago you never would
[53:59] have heard of a selfie
[54:04] selfie sticks everywhere it's me here
[54:07] it's me there it's me here at my
[54:10] grandmother's funeral it's me here on
[54:13] you know
[54:16] you never had these instagrams and that
[54:18] nonsense
[54:19] where people have to portray themselves
[54:21] look how could they look
[54:24] being influenced by all the garbage out
[54:26] there
[54:28] lovers of themselves you know
[54:33] i i just uh i'm not on these
[54:36] facebooks and things but i find this
[54:39] every now and then
[54:41] then i see something and i was
[54:45] getting a bit disturbed there was a girl
[54:49] she used to come to church she was
[54:51] brought up a christian but obviously
[54:53] her own ideas and she portrays herself
[54:58] on this facebook or whatever it is or
[55:00] instagram or
[55:01] in such a way which is indecent
[55:06] and they know people from church who
[55:08] knew her
[55:10] put a like on it how can you like
[55:13] phil's how can you identify with ted you
[55:16] should have put a rebuke on it
[55:18] not the like you know what i mean it's
[55:22] so easily done
[55:23] like you know
[55:26] i know it's clothesline religions but
[55:29] it's true
[55:30] you identify you say like and you
[55:32] encourage to filth
[55:34] don't be part either offer the
[55:35] reputation if you never suffer
[55:37] persecution that's when it starts
[55:41] yeah you know if you if you just put
[55:43] likes on the filth
[55:44] you don't suffer persecution you ask for
[55:48] more the next one is even filthier you
[55:50] know
[55:51] and put likes on it
[55:55] lovers of themselves
[56:00] covetous i don't need to explain that
[56:04] one
[56:04] boasters proud
[56:09] bless famous
[56:12] disobedient to parents well that's a new
[56:15] one
[56:18] this why should you obey the parents you
[56:21] know it's not taught anymore
[56:24] unthankful the world is so
[56:28] unthankful
[56:31] unholy without natural affection
[56:37] truth breakers
[56:40] how many even politicians say things and
[56:43] they don't do it you know
[56:44] truth breakers false accusers
[56:52] fake news incontinent
[56:55] fierce despisers of those that are good
[57:00] now you take somebody that's good and he
[57:03] makes one little mistake or whatever
[57:05] the headlines are full hairlines are
[57:07] full
[57:08] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[57:12] pleasure
[57:13] more than lovers of god that's a fact
[57:16] too
[57:18] now it's lovers of pleasure what worldly
[57:20] pleasures
[57:22] you don't have to sit home day and night
[57:25] read the bible
[57:26] but you need to have your meditation
[57:28] upon him
[57:29] and and know his priority
[57:34] i remember when i first come to the lord
[57:36] i lived about three hours drive away
[57:41] i didn't get a lot of visitors from home
[57:43] my mother wouldn't come because i didn't
[57:45] have the coffee she liked and my sister
[57:47] wouldn't come because i didn't have a
[57:49] television that she liked a certain
[57:51] program i mean
[57:54] have your priorities right i said well
[57:58] if
[57:58] if your cuff coffee is more important
[58:00] than your television stay home
[58:01] you know don't have to cut
[58:05] but you know that's the sign of the time
[58:08] it's all aurelius
[58:10] and then it says
[58:14] having a form of godliness but denying
[58:16] the power there are from such
[58:18] tune away and that's probably the worst
[58:20] you know
[58:21] they look like some kind of christians
[58:23] or something
[58:24] but deny the power of god you know not
[58:27] oh yes the god can heal
[58:30] but can't he give you the victory over
[58:32] sin
[58:33] can he give you power to live a
[58:35] christian life in this day
[58:37] he can and denying death is denying the
[58:41] power thereof
[58:43] otherwise who shines in this last day if
[58:46] not you and i
[58:48] we are given understandings of the times
[58:53] i think that's wonderful and you know
[58:55] that's a gift
[58:56] god has even given to his children in
[58:58] the past
[59:00] first chronicles 12 32 says
[59:04] and the children of issachar which were
[59:07] men that have understanding of the times
[59:11] to know what israel ought to do
[59:16] we've got that gift i know we live in
[59:19] the last days
[59:20] if you do you have to gift as well
[59:23] understanding the times
[59:25] you see the holy spirit is given to us
[59:27] that's what it is
[59:31] we we know it's the holy spirit that's
[59:34] like he says in luke
[59:35] 24 49 and behold i sent the promise of
[59:38] my father upon you
[59:39] but terry in the city of jerusalem until
[59:41] you be in you
[59:43] with power from on high
[59:46] now i'll tell you one thing
[59:49] when you endured with power from on high
[59:53] you see things in a different light you
[59:55] see it differently you understand
[59:58] you don't have to fear i mean there are
[1:00:00] many examples in the scripture where
[1:00:02] people just didn't see and were fearful
[1:00:06] like uh when when uh
[1:00:10] what the gehazi or one of them he said
[1:00:13] alas
[1:00:14] we are done you know he saw all his army
[1:00:16] of the assyrians
[1:00:18] and then the prophet prayed said lord
[1:00:21] just open his eyes
[1:00:22] he didn't say send angel he said open
[1:00:25] his eyes
[1:00:26] you know are around us and if you can't
[1:00:29] see it
[1:00:30] doesn't mean they're not there we're
[1:00:32] surrounded by angels even this morning
[1:00:35] i believe the lord's here as well
[1:00:39] whether we see it or not some people
[1:00:41] have can see it get a gift or get a
[1:00:44] glimpse
[1:00:45] but whether we see it or not it's here
[1:00:47] so
[1:00:49] by the holy ghost we know and i like to
[1:00:52] make a point here
[1:00:54] you can you know the disciples
[1:00:58] were believers when god called them
[1:01:02] even without the holy ghost but not the
[1:01:04] same kind
[1:01:05] of believers they recognized christ
[1:01:08] but they haven't had it in them and you
[1:01:11] know
[1:01:13] i i was saying the other day just
[1:01:16] talking somebody talked about when god
[1:01:19] spoke to you and you know i've people
[1:01:22] say
[1:01:22] well such and such a time when i went to
[1:01:25] church
[1:01:26] become a christian that's when god spoke
[1:01:28] to me or uh
[1:01:30] or when i came into the message god
[1:01:32] spoke to me
[1:01:34] i tell you what god spoke to me when i
[1:01:35] was in egypt when i was still in the
[1:01:37] world that's why man of the world
[1:01:39] he spoke to me right down there said hey
[1:01:42] that's not your place that's wrong
[1:01:43] that's wrong
[1:01:44] he opened my eyes for the truth
[1:01:48] so he has known you before the
[1:01:50] foundation of the world
[1:01:52] and he made a way for you before the
[1:01:56] foundation of the world
[1:01:57] the christ that the lamb was slain
[1:01:59] before the foundation of the world it
[1:02:01] was all in god's program
[1:02:03] so when did he know you when did he
[1:02:08] call you when you were still lost in the
[1:02:10] world
[1:02:12] you know wonderful so when he called the
[1:02:14] disciples
[1:02:16] they were still lost in the world
[1:02:20] i'll read you just uh an interesting one
[1:02:22] here in luke
[1:02:24] uh 9 18-22
[1:02:27] and it came to pass as he was alone
[1:02:30] praying his disciples were with him
[1:02:32] and he asked them whom say the people
[1:02:35] that i
[1:02:36] am the answer the ring said john the
[1:02:39] baptist
[1:02:40] some say that but some say elias
[1:02:44] and others say that one of the old
[1:02:46] prophets is risen again
[1:02:49] he said unto them but whom say ye that i
[1:02:52] am i mean that question is still valid
[1:02:55] for us today
[1:02:56] what is christ to you and peter
[1:03:00] answering
[1:03:02] the christ of god
[1:03:05] and he straightly charged him and
[1:03:08] commanded them
[1:03:10] to tell no man that thing
[1:03:13] and you have you ever wondered why he
[1:03:14] told him not to tell anybody
[1:03:16] the good news he is the christ because
[1:03:19] it has to come by revelation
[1:03:21] not by learning if you learn it it's
[1:03:24] never
[1:03:24] the same it's not the same
[1:03:28] it comes by revelation and then
[1:03:31] saying here
[1:03:34] the son of man must suffer many things
[1:03:38] and be rejected of the elders and chief
[1:03:41] priests and scribes
[1:03:43] and be slain and be raised the third day
[1:03:48] he tells his disciples exactly
[1:03:51] not not only once it's in in several
[1:03:53] places he says he even
[1:03:55] told him exactly he would be scorched
[1:03:58] and he would be this and would be that
[1:04:00] the third day he shall rise now
[1:04:03] have you ever wondered why they weren't
[1:04:05] lining up at the graveside the third day
[1:04:08] just to wait for the resurrection
[1:04:10] because it was so
[1:04:11] far removed from them that they even
[1:04:14] didn't believe it
[1:04:18] the contrary the contrary the women went
[1:04:20] there with
[1:04:21] spices to anoint the dead not the living
[1:04:27] now you see that
[1:04:30] is something when you
[1:04:33] know of the lord but you don't know the
[1:04:36] lord
[1:04:37] that's what happens but when you know
[1:04:40] the lord
[1:04:41] you'd be waiting there that's why we're
[1:04:42] waiting for the coming of the lord
[1:04:45] if you know the lord you'll be there
[1:04:48] third day okay if you are we he's dead
[1:04:51] now
[1:04:52] they crucified him you you don't go back
[1:04:55] to your fishing you go
[1:04:56] to the gravesite we're waiting we stay
[1:04:58] here till the third day
[1:05:00] and he'll come amen you see but they
[1:05:03] didn't see that
[1:05:04] and he explained it in detail and that
[1:05:06] was the word of god
[1:05:09] and even today people have
[1:05:13] no trouble to believe in jesus dying
[1:05:16] for your sins on the cross most people
[1:05:19] have no trouble with that
[1:05:21] but a lot of people have trouble to
[1:05:22] believe in the risen
[1:05:24] christ who can perform the same thing
[1:05:26] today as he did then
[1:05:28] that's where the trouble is you know
[1:05:30] when we have a problem
[1:05:31] where we go first call is the
[1:05:35] or first call is this or what what is it
[1:05:37] i mean there's nothing wrong with a
[1:05:39] doctor
[1:05:40] but you see he is still the same
[1:05:43] yesterday today and forever and we want
[1:05:45] to believe in the living christ
[1:05:47] the one that actually rose from the deed
[1:05:50] and not
[1:05:51] believe in the christ who told them all
[1:05:53] these things something
[1:05:54] don't believe in the resurrection so to
[1:05:58] know
[1:05:58] christ comes by revelation
[1:06:03] so let's believe the word and expect the
[1:06:06] power
[1:06:07] of the living christ i'd like to read a
[1:06:10] quote here
[1:06:11] for i reckon that the suffering of this
[1:06:14] present time
[1:06:15] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:06:17] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:06:20] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:06:22] reign with him
[1:06:23] you have to suffer to reign the reason
[1:06:26] for this is that character simply is
[1:06:30] never made
[1:06:31] without suffering character is a victory
[1:06:35] not a gift a man without character can't
[1:06:39] reign because power apart from character
[1:06:42] is satanic
[1:06:44] that's quite something isn't it but
[1:06:46] power
[1:06:47] with character is fit to rule
[1:06:51] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:06:54] throne
[1:06:55] on the same basis that he overcame and
[1:06:57] he sit down
[1:06:59] in his father's throne then we have to
[1:07:02] overcome to sit with him and little
[1:07:05] temporary suffering we go through now
[1:07:08] is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:07:10] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[1:07:12] in us when he comes
[1:07:15] all what treasures are laid up for those
[1:07:17] who are willing to enter into the
[1:07:19] kingdom
[1:07:20] through much tribulation
[1:07:23] see at the moment
[1:07:27] anyway in this country we don't
[1:07:31] suffer physical persecution
[1:07:34] but you may suffer sometimes
[1:07:38] you're not selected for certain thing or
[1:07:40] you're not invited to certain things
[1:07:42] there's all sorts of things or that
[1:07:44] people talk funny about you
[1:07:46] or or laugh about you you know we suffer
[1:07:49] in other ways
[1:07:51] but kind of great
[1:07:56] great glory you know it is something
[1:07:59] that's ordained
[1:08:02] you know people don't see that you're a
[1:08:04] christian
[1:08:06] you probably don't suffer you just you
[1:08:08] know go
[1:08:09] the same way as the world and
[1:08:15] i'll tell you what it's it's it's good
[1:08:18] when people
[1:08:19] come to know you and
[1:08:23] the first few minutes they ask you
[1:08:25] you're a christian
[1:08:26] it's really lovely and if they picked it
[1:08:29] up
[1:08:30] i felt felt a little bit ashamed a while
[1:08:33] ago i was riding my motorbike down the
[1:08:35] road
[1:08:36] probably a bit too fast and one of those
[1:08:40] bikes came along and he
[1:08:44] gave me the thumbs up he identified
[1:08:48] me with the bikey that wasn't very good
[1:08:50] but i'm just making the point
[1:08:53] you don't suffer persecution that way
[1:08:57] but if you make a stand for the lord you
[1:08:59] do
[1:09:02] now there's another scripture here or a
[1:09:06] quote
[1:09:07] what the father's word was
[1:09:11] he used the father's word to defeat
[1:09:13] satan
[1:09:15] without even using his power
[1:09:18] now here comes a really good one i was
[1:09:21] made aware of this the other day
[1:09:25] he defeated
[1:09:28] satan just by speaking the word
[1:09:33] no not by anything else
[1:09:36] not by power not by sending fire down
[1:09:39] not by any of that
[1:09:40] just by the word now in proverbs 4
[1:09:44] verse 20 to 22 it says
[1:09:47] my son and obviously daughter as well
[1:09:51] attend to my words
[1:09:55] incline thine ear unto
[1:09:58] my sayings i just want you to
[1:10:02] stop here for one second incline thine
[1:10:04] ear
[1:10:05] unto my sayings
[1:10:10] we can incline our ear to many sayings
[1:10:14] you can incline your ear to what the
[1:10:16] newspaper says
[1:10:19] or what this prince or
[1:10:23] or this politician does or this one does
[1:10:26] we can incline areas to these things
[1:10:28] but incline your ears to god's saying
[1:10:32] now there's a difference
[1:10:35] one leaves you empty and angry and
[1:10:37] confused
[1:10:38] but the other one leaves you
[1:10:41] glorious let them not depart from thine
[1:10:44] eyes
[1:10:45] keep them in the midst of thine heart
[1:10:49] for they are life
[1:10:52] and those that find them
[1:10:56] and health to all their flesh
[1:10:59] so just inclining
[1:11:02] your ear to the things of god
[1:11:06] expose yourself to the word health
[1:11:10] to your flesh amen without prayer
[1:11:14] without anything else without just
[1:11:17] inclining you here
[1:11:19] and you know um about two years ago when
[1:11:22] i was a
[1:11:23] a i was paralyzed in in one foot
[1:11:28] and had a back injury and
[1:11:31] you know in the back you have a lot of
[1:11:32] nerves and things can go wrong
[1:11:35] and what happened i could not
[1:11:39] find relief i prayed and
[1:11:42] lord take this pain away and this and
[1:11:45] eventually i said lord if
[1:11:47] if it's meant to go through the doctor
[1:11:49] i'm be willing whatever you say and
[1:11:52] yeah you know i had all these
[1:11:55] various emotional things coming
[1:11:58] my way but uh what happened i
[1:12:01] inclined my ear towards the lord
[1:12:05] and you know cut i cut the story short
[1:12:09] but i was on the operating table
[1:12:13] and the doctor said to me if i were you
[1:12:15] i'll cancel the operation
[1:12:18] and i cancelled it i rejoiced in christ
[1:12:22] i was still crippled i was still
[1:12:26] not well but i rejoiced
[1:12:29] i inclined my head to the lord and day
[1:12:32] three or day four i wake up completely
[1:12:34] healed
[1:12:37] you know not it wasn't the prayer
[1:12:40] it wasn't uh that i was super spiritual
[1:12:44] but it was listening to the lord i've
[1:12:46] got an i i i paid and oh
[1:12:48] i what do you call it these little
[1:12:51] things
[1:12:53] my ear and and uh
[1:12:56] i listen to the message and listen to
[1:12:58] the bible most nights
[1:13:00] and you know it can't say i'm up the
[1:13:02] whole night but uh
[1:13:04] you incline your ear towards things of
[1:13:06] the lord it helps your bones
[1:13:08] it's healthy system and it's it's not
[1:13:11] necessarily the prayer it's not as much
[1:13:14] as i believe in prayer
[1:13:16] but it's what scripture says for they
[1:13:19] are
[1:13:19] life unto those they find them and
[1:13:21] health to all their flesh
[1:13:24] just incline you to the lord let's
[1:13:27] listen to the things of god and not so
[1:13:29] much to what they say out there
[1:13:33] now it's good one more thing here i'd
[1:13:35] like to see
[1:13:40] you know we live in such a colorful
[1:13:44] world at the moment we're exposed to all
[1:13:47] sorts of things
[1:13:49] and sometimes you get thoughts which
[1:13:52] are not really you can say oh
[1:13:55] they're useless you know they're not
[1:13:57] christians or that they're
[1:13:59] wrong bible says cast down
[1:14:02] evil imagination okay because there
[1:14:05] comes
[1:14:06] we are exposed to that who who has ever
[1:14:09] had a nightmare
[1:14:10] any one of you you didn't choose to have
[1:14:13] a nightmare
[1:14:14] yeah and you know i sometimes pray lord
[1:14:16] cleanse me from even these dreams and
[1:14:18] everything you know
[1:14:20] and but you see amongst all
[1:14:24] there's some good you can get a
[1:14:26] spiritual dream
[1:14:28] you can't even get a spiritual dream
[1:14:29] amongst nightmares
[1:14:31] portion of it did you know that visions
[1:14:35] and dreams are um
[1:14:39] i think brother brandon explains it this
[1:14:41] way a vision is basically a dream
[1:14:43] being awake you know and
[1:14:47] you always have to test is it of god or
[1:14:50] is it not of god
[1:14:52] it's same i may make it an
[1:14:55] example when you go to the shop and you
[1:14:58] want to buy bread
[1:14:59] you're a supermarket everything else is
[1:15:02] offered to you too
[1:15:04] good stuff bad stuff a lot of rubbish
[1:15:08] stuff
[1:15:08] but you don't have to choose it you
[1:15:11] don't have to feel guilty seeing it
[1:15:13] but you choose what is of god and what
[1:15:16] do you want
[1:15:17] so the other night i had a few dreams
[1:15:22] i don't want to go into that too much
[1:15:23] but a point
[1:15:25] that stood out to me
[1:15:28] i was dreaming and i was standing here
[1:15:31] preaching my heart out
[1:15:34] crying at people shouting at people and
[1:15:37] pointing
[1:15:38] here was a jug of water and there was a
[1:15:41] glass
[1:15:42] and i was shouting about this and they
[1:15:45] said you
[1:15:46] have to be born again you know it's not
[1:15:48] just behold this
[1:15:50] you have to have it in you and i thought
[1:15:53] that was of the lord
[1:15:55] you see a jug full of water
[1:15:59] that there's when you recognize the word
[1:16:01] of god when you can see it
[1:16:02] when you can even understand it
[1:16:06] but it's no part of you until you pour
[1:16:08] it in the vessel
[1:16:10] and drink it yourself and that stood out
[1:16:13] to me so much
[1:16:15] so i thought look we have
[1:16:19] the revealed word of god
[1:16:23] vindicator by prophet the anointed word
[1:16:27] for the hour
[1:16:29] and the power to overcome
[1:16:32] we've been restored to the faith of the
[1:16:34] fathers according to the word
[1:16:37] that's all in the jug it's all in the
[1:16:40] jack
[1:16:42] here you see the jug is full
[1:16:48] what about serpent seed
[1:16:54] it's in a jug it's in the jug
[1:16:59] the seven church ages he explained it's
[1:17:02] in a jug
[1:17:06] the revelation of the seven seals is in
[1:17:08] the jug
[1:17:10] yeah no it's not somewhere i have to
[1:17:12] learn this
[1:17:13] no it's here in the jug here's the jug
[1:17:16] and here's the glass
[1:17:17] you're the glass
[1:17:21] and i thought you know baptism in the
[1:17:23] name of lord jesus christ
[1:17:25] it's in the jug
[1:17:28] are you recognizing the pure water in
[1:17:31] the jug the pure word
[1:17:32] yes so you want to be baptized in the
[1:17:35] name of lord jesus christ
[1:17:37] and i believe most of us did you see
[1:17:40] it's in the jug it's not
[1:17:44] out wherever it's a mystery it's right
[1:17:47] there
[1:17:48] and we be hold it and we can see it
[1:17:52] we just need to drink it i thought you
[1:17:55] know about the godhead
[1:17:57] you know many times uh i mean up into a
[1:18:01] church when i was young
[1:18:02] and they always talked about the mystery
[1:18:05] of the trinity
[1:18:06] the mystery i thought the church should
[1:18:09] solve the mystery for you you know
[1:18:12] christ in you the hope of glory that's a
[1:18:14] great mystery
[1:18:15] but you see the mystery of the trinity
[1:18:19] where do you find that and then when
[1:18:22] i i can say from a personal experience
[1:18:26] when i met up with this
[1:18:31] it was a maori brother outside a pub
[1:18:33] doing outreach i come out
[1:18:35] drunk as can be otherwise i would not
[1:18:37] have felt confident to go and pet him on
[1:18:39] his
[1:18:40] back so i didn't say you do a good job
[1:18:43] out here convert those heathens out here
[1:18:45] i said to him
[1:18:46] and and he realized that
[1:18:49] i had something missing i didn't realize
[1:18:52] because i couldn't see
[1:18:54] i said oh i believe in god i'm fine
[1:18:57] drunk as can be and
[1:19:00] he said may i pray for you
[1:19:04] your mind if i pray for you pray for me
[1:19:08] never heard such a thing pray for
[1:19:10] somebody i thought if you pray
[1:19:12] you pray yourself lord give me this help
[1:19:14] me here do that
[1:19:16] pray for somebody else never cross my
[1:19:19] mind
[1:19:20] he prayed for me and he asked the lord
[1:19:24] jesus to
[1:19:25] whatever i can't even remember but
[1:19:27] things started to happen
[1:19:30] i was so touched next day i was in a
[1:19:34] different town and somebody gave me a
[1:19:36] bible
[1:19:38] well out of this world you know one
[1:19:40] after the other i went home so i read
[1:19:42] the bible
[1:19:44] and started to get convicted because it
[1:19:47] was the word of god
[1:19:48] but one thing struck me
[1:19:52] and that that was the start of it all
[1:19:55] we talked about the revelation of jesus
[1:19:58] christ
[1:19:59] the godhead i
[1:20:02] knew the bible says not to have any gods
[1:20:05] beside him
[1:20:06] you can't have two gods
[1:20:09] but god is a spirit
[1:20:13] and that spirit sent his son
[1:20:16] and indwelled him and reconciled the
[1:20:19] world himself
[1:20:21] so we're not serving a different god but
[1:20:23] we have to recognize jesus christ
[1:20:25] who proclaimed the name of god and
[1:20:30] that struck me before i even had a real
[1:20:32] holy ghost experience
[1:20:33] then jesus is god amen i
[1:20:37] cannot have jesus as a second great
[1:20:40] person
[1:20:40] he must be god and that hit me
[1:20:44] and then i went to this church later on
[1:20:46] and they talked about the
[1:20:48] mystery for of the trinity and then
[1:20:51] and then somebody gave me a pamphlet and
[1:20:53] here was no man was a be it there's
[1:20:55] supposed to be god
[1:20:56] and he was a younger one supposed to be
[1:20:57] christ and he was a
[1:20:59] young woman in some funny outfit and
[1:21:01] there was the holy ghost
[1:21:04] i mean they couldn't convince me with it
[1:21:07] anymore
[1:21:08] you know i was amongst a whole group
[1:21:11] to them it was all a mystery but to me
[1:21:14] it was clear
[1:21:16] and i found scriptures to confirm that's
[1:21:19] why i so much rejoiced when i heard
[1:21:21] brother brown preach on it
[1:21:23] because it hit home of what god already
[1:21:26] showed me
[1:21:27] and praise god it's in the jug
[1:21:30] in the jug it's in the jug
[1:21:33] to god here divine healing
[1:21:38] it's in the jug you know i'm not saying
[1:21:42] you can't get sick i'm not saying things
[1:21:45] cannot happen to you or or uh
[1:21:48] you know i know many many good men they
[1:21:52] died of a disease
[1:21:54] satan struck them with the disease you
[1:21:56] know
[1:21:57] and uh doesn't mean
[1:22:00] we have eternal life in this flesh you
[1:22:03] know
[1:22:04] well uh pray lord
[1:22:08] restore my ears my eyes my hair uh
[1:22:11] restore this let me be young again yeah
[1:22:14] that'll come
[1:22:15] in in the rapture but if we go through
[1:22:18] this
[1:22:18] life and this if the little terrorists
[1:22:22] all of us so but divine healing is still
[1:22:27] our portion
[1:22:28] and that's in the jug it's in the word
[1:22:31] and
[1:22:31] you just picture that jack full of the
[1:22:35] pure word
[1:22:36] of god full of water and you have to
[1:22:38] glass there
[1:22:41] it's great to recognize it's good unless
[1:22:44] you fill it up and drink it
[1:22:46] it's great to rejoice when other people
[1:22:48] drink it and
[1:22:49] have the glory of god in their lives
[1:22:50] it's great to rejoice and sympathize
[1:22:52] but that doesn't heal you that doesn't
[1:22:54] do anything for you
[1:22:56] it's got to be you drinking that water
[1:23:01] now i tell you another one that's in the
[1:23:02] jug
[1:23:05] the eagle anointing for this day is in
[1:23:07] the jug
[1:23:08] have we heard of that but it's there
[1:23:13] but we need to have it and what does it
[1:23:16] do
[1:23:17] an eagle anointing it gives you eyes to
[1:23:19] see you fly above everything
[1:23:21] and you look down and say wow
[1:23:24] look what it looks like from up there
[1:23:27] you know every problem every situation
[1:23:29] you flap your wings and then you look
[1:23:31] down well there's nothing
[1:23:33] what's got that you know to do with the
[1:23:35] power of god and the glory of god and
[1:23:37] where we're going and what's happening
[1:23:39] in our lives
[1:23:40] you see that anointing is in the jug if
[1:23:43] you haven't experienced it
[1:23:44] fill your glass fill your glass you know
[1:23:47] that's really what it is
[1:23:49] sometimes oh it's for this and this
[1:23:51] preachers know about this and
[1:23:53] and he doesn't know and he does this and
[1:23:56] you know
[1:23:57] it's for you it's for every believer
[1:24:02] and i'll tell you another one it's the
[1:24:04] anointing
[1:24:05] to see and the anointing to overcome is
[1:24:08] in this jug as well
[1:24:11] a very good one is in the jug it's
[1:24:14] perfect love amen
[1:24:17] you know you can't love everyone the
[1:24:20] holy ghost
[1:24:21] that's the perfect love the holy ghost
[1:24:24] in you
[1:24:25] that's in the jug
[1:24:28] for us to have yeah you know i can't
[1:24:31] understand
[1:24:32] why sorry i should say not so you can't
[1:24:35] understand i do understand
[1:24:37] why sometimes people have issues you
[1:24:40] know
[1:24:40] or don't like this person i don't like
[1:24:42] that person or see negatives here and
[1:24:44] there
[1:24:45] oh because sometimes we are
[1:24:49] exposed and incline our ear
[1:24:53] to the wrong things or we haven't
[1:24:57] died as much as we should and then we
[1:24:59] get offended
[1:25:01] have you ever been offended
[1:25:04] i have lots of brothers oh sorry i don't
[1:25:07] want to offend you
[1:25:09] because i'm used to much worse than that
[1:25:10] so you can't offend me
[1:25:12] you know people want to apologize
[1:25:15] but you get rugged you know brother ryan
[1:25:19] says
[1:25:20] you want to be like a rugged christian
[1:25:22] like a
[1:25:24] not like a hybrid flower something
[1:25:27] rugged
[1:25:27] you don't want to be offended and and
[1:25:30] compromise
[1:25:32] that love no we don't
[1:25:36] but we can be offended of course we can
[1:25:38] if we want to be offended
[1:25:40] it's easy to offend and then once you're
[1:25:42] offended you see problems everywhere
[1:25:44] in everything everything people do
[1:25:46] whether right or wrong
[1:25:47] you think the wrong thing about it but
[1:25:50] perfect love is in that jug
[1:25:53] so if there's any of that hey
[1:25:57] repent of it and fill the glass fill the
[1:26:00] glass
[1:26:01] you know there's one in filling and many
[1:26:03] refillings
[1:26:04] it's wonderful you know what else
[1:26:08] is in the job the rapture
[1:26:11] that's in the jug that's what we're
[1:26:12] looking forward to
[1:26:14] to go be translated yeah you know when
[1:26:17] the deadly cries rise
[1:26:19] i believe we see them but that's not the
[1:26:23] time
[1:26:23] to wanting to fill the glass that's too
[1:26:26] late
[1:26:27] it's like you know when they shut the
[1:26:29] door and the rain started oh well it
[1:26:31] looks like the real thing now
[1:26:33] it's too late but
[1:26:37] just imagine you you see somebody you've
[1:26:39] known that's going on before
[1:26:42] walking in see brothers it's on
[1:26:45] whoa you know you're just thinking about
[1:26:48] you almost take off
[1:26:51] yeah you know but it's facts that's what
[1:26:54] i'm waiting for
[1:26:56] i don't want to be an unconverted
[1:26:58] disciple
[1:26:59] who fails to seek the resurrection when
[1:27:02] jesus rose the third day
[1:27:04] and moan and complain and be sad and
[1:27:07] miserable somewhere
[1:27:08] i want to be there waiting for the
[1:27:11] day to rise i want to be there to see
[1:27:14] the living christ
[1:27:15] even today you see it's so
[1:27:18] so easy just to behold you know look
[1:27:22] here's the glass
[1:27:27] you hold the glass it doesn't quench the
[1:27:29] thirst to tell you that much
[1:27:30] but you see behold the jug does not do
[1:27:33] anything
[1:27:34] i believe the bible only the king james
[1:27:37] version
[1:27:38] that doesn't get you there amen is it in
[1:27:41] your heart have you got love for your
[1:27:42] brother who
[1:27:43] who reads the good news bible you know
[1:27:46] i've seen people arguing and fussing and
[1:27:49] and tearing each other to bits just
[1:27:50] because of that
[1:27:52] that's right sure i believe it's
[1:27:55] inspired
[1:27:56] so i i read the king james bible but
[1:27:58] sometimes i look up other translations
[1:28:01] sometimes written in the luther bible
[1:28:03] and sometimes read in the french bible
[1:28:05] doesn't mean i'm not part of it
[1:28:09] you know what i mean let's
[1:28:12] fill that not just behold the jug
[1:28:16] but let's be drinking of it
[1:28:20] so just in closing i'd like to say
[1:28:23] a couple more things here can you see
[1:28:27] and recognize the jug full of god's word
[1:28:30] and power
[1:28:32] i think most of us can and we have
[1:28:35] witness
[1:28:36] i don't know for a while i was listening
[1:28:39] to prayer lines every night
[1:28:40] i'll tell you what i got so much out of
[1:28:42] it i mean
[1:28:44] you start to hear and see things and you
[1:28:46] see the power of god revealed
[1:28:48] whoa that's
[1:28:53] somebody drank of that wood you know but
[1:28:56] you know
[1:28:56] for me sympathizing with it doesn't do
[1:28:59] it for me
[1:29:00] when i need it it's not just
[1:29:04] seeing it it's like yeah that's a pure
[1:29:07] word that's the word that's the revealed
[1:29:09] word that's the
[1:29:10] what does it do for you i know people
[1:29:13] they jump up and down
[1:29:14] revealed word and there's so much
[1:29:16] revelation i said the other day
[1:29:18] they had they have so much
[1:29:22] grace in their lives they can do
[1:29:23] whatever they want you know
[1:29:25] there's so much grace that they only
[1:29:27] have judgments for others left you know
[1:29:30] no more grace but you see
[1:29:35] then you look at the lives of people
[1:29:39] whoa miserable
[1:29:43] i mean i was happy we satisfied this
[1:29:46] but you don't see the power of god you
[1:29:49] to have words
[1:29:50] words words and it's actually true what
[1:29:52] they say
[1:29:53] and you look at the joke yes i can't
[1:29:55] argue with that
[1:29:56] but hey it's for you you know that's
[1:29:59] where we
[1:30:00] miss sometimes you know sympathy
[1:30:03] is not victory if you sympathise with
[1:30:06] some
[1:30:06] great warrior it doesn't make you a
[1:30:09] warrior
[1:30:11] he says as little as drinking milk make
[1:30:13] you a farmer you know
[1:30:15] it's it's but it's just how people
[1:30:17] simply perceive things
[1:30:18] sympathize with a message and sympathize
[1:30:21] with with a prophet and sympathize with
[1:30:23] it
[1:30:23] doesn't make you a powerful walking
[1:30:26] their power
[1:30:27] you have to drink the word of god as he
[1:30:30] serves it to you know that somebody
[1:30:32] tries to
[1:30:33] stuff it down your throat as the lord
[1:30:35] reveals it to you
[1:30:36] and brings it to you and that will take
[1:30:39] you there
[1:30:41] i think it's good to meditate upon these
[1:30:43] things
[1:30:46] now question but have you poured it into
[1:30:49] your glass you know that's the question
[1:30:51] we have to ask isn't it my glass have i
[1:30:54] really drunk it
[1:30:56] you know is it in your vessel
[1:31:02] have you had a refill lately
[1:31:05] have you had a refill lately never
[1:31:08] forget
[1:31:08] uh many years ago i was so
[1:31:11] dry in my spiritual life dry i was still
[1:31:15] single then
[1:31:16] i just could not get out of it
[1:31:20] i hated to be so dry i hated to be
[1:31:23] kind of indifferent you know it
[1:31:26] didn't really interest me much i hated
[1:31:29] it i prayed against it and
[1:31:30] everything and then to top it off i went
[1:31:33] to a
[1:31:33] a meeting down south and they had
[1:31:37] i was listening a meeting you know as
[1:31:38] bored as can be
[1:31:40] i hope you're not bored this morning but
[1:31:42] i was
[1:31:43] actually like bored it was
[1:31:47] probably not bad preaching but i didn't
[1:31:49] feel inspired at all
[1:31:51] and to top it off
[1:31:54] they're coming in and footwashing
[1:31:56] afterwards so it dragged on for quite a
[1:31:58] while
[1:31:59] and i was sitting there in the bench
[1:32:02] you know i said i don't know did i have
[1:32:05] my my socks off or not but
[1:32:09] i was sitting there oh bored
[1:32:12] and not enthused at all and then there
[1:32:16] was two brothers on you know
[1:32:18] praying for each other lovely but it
[1:32:20] didn't really touch me or do anything
[1:32:23] and then i said oh you know i hated that
[1:32:27] and despite the way i felt
[1:32:30] i quietly prayed not enthused just
[1:32:34] mumbled the prayers i lowered bless
[1:32:36] those brothers who wash each other's
[1:32:38] feet and yeah
[1:32:39] you know like that and you know what
[1:32:41] happened
[1:32:43] suddenly i felt the holy ghost so strong
[1:32:47] like not for months and months or years
[1:32:51] and he got stronger i thought man they
[1:32:53] must be up on these brothers you know
[1:32:55] the reflection of it but no it was on me
[1:32:58] it pulled me out of my seat i could not
[1:33:01] help it
[1:33:02] i went i don't know how high i went i
[1:33:05] was screaming and shouting and praising
[1:33:07] god
[1:33:08] what was it and in feeling
[1:33:11] inclining your ears to the lord despite
[1:33:14] how you feel
[1:33:16] healed he is real and you know he can
[1:33:19] lift you up
[1:33:20] just like that and you know when you
[1:33:22] feel miserable
[1:33:23] just go it and and and praise god
[1:33:28] and the less you feel like the more
[1:33:29] effective it is to tell you that much
[1:33:32] so have we had an infilling lately
[1:33:36] you know we are part of god's great
[1:33:39] vision did you know that and step
[1:33:42] by step he fulfills what
[1:33:46] vision he's got for us you know you know
[1:33:49] i think it's just one of the first
[1:33:52] messages
[1:33:52] in the message uh we had this great
[1:33:56] vision
[1:33:57] and the lord just showed him step by
[1:33:59] step he comes to this place now
[1:34:02] this man will come out the shop and
[1:34:04] wearing such a cap and
[1:34:06] do this and he will tell you where to go
[1:34:08] why could
[1:34:09] god tell him to begin with where to go
[1:34:11] you know
[1:34:12] that's a natural mind but it is he's
[1:34:15] playing his program
[1:34:17] step by step so if he showed you a step
[1:34:22] you go until on where to from here
[1:34:26] he will show you further but he can't
[1:34:28] cannot show you further until he
[1:34:31] made that step he showed you in the
[1:34:32] first place and sometimes people
[1:34:34] want to start right without
[1:34:38] you know without repentance without
[1:34:40] going through the gospels they want to
[1:34:41] be right in revelation somewhere
[1:34:44] and it just doesn't work step
[1:34:47] by step according to the vision god has
[1:34:50] for us
[1:34:53] i don't know if you get it what i mean
[1:34:55] but it it is
[1:34:57] even when uh once he he prayed for a
[1:35:00] child
[1:35:01] god showed him it'll be healed but he
[1:35:03] overstepped the vision
[1:35:05] and the child could worse and then he
[1:35:07] went and repented and waited until
[1:35:09] everything was set in place
[1:35:11] and then the power of god came down and
[1:35:13] you see it's the same
[1:35:14] in our lives we've got to be in the
[1:35:17] place where god wants us to be
[1:35:19] for the power of god to come down and if
[1:35:21] you showed us a certain step
[1:35:23] and we have not made that step you won't
[1:35:26] get
[1:35:26] a second instruction from him
[1:35:30] it's there where the instruction comes
[1:35:32] it's like that man that came out that
[1:35:34] the garage he said he will tell you
[1:35:36] where to go
[1:35:38] so he had to wait till he saw that man
[1:35:40] come out the garage
[1:35:42] go there to get the next instruction
[1:35:45] and you know that makes life exciting
[1:35:49] we know the end of course but we get
[1:35:51] instructions
[1:35:52] i don't know if you've ever done one of
[1:35:54] those uh i don't know
[1:35:56] orientation
[1:36:00] parkours things oh i don't know what you
[1:36:02] call it we
[1:36:03] we had that at school at times what do
[1:36:05] you call these things
[1:36:09] yeah so we had to
[1:36:12] to follow some kind of a map go
[1:36:14] somewhere and there was a post
[1:36:16] where they gave the instruction what to
[1:36:18] do next you know
[1:36:20] and to one we came that wasn't actually
[1:36:23] at school but
[1:36:24] to one we came and there was this cave
[1:36:28] we found it yeah that's the cave you
[1:36:30] know and then you go in the cave and
[1:36:32] there sits a guy and there was a candle
[1:36:34] he said i'm the light of the world and
[1:36:37] then
[1:36:38] take a candle light it now you're the
[1:36:41] light of the world
[1:36:42] you know and you have to make sure the
[1:36:44] candle doesn't go out and
[1:36:45] find your next place you know but you
[1:36:48] know you didn't know
[1:36:49] until you were at that place what the
[1:36:51] next play is going to be and
[1:36:52] what the next instruction is we
[1:36:54] shouldn't go ahead we just want to stay
[1:36:57] we know we live in exciting times let's
[1:37:00] just
[1:37:01] finish with a little quote
[1:37:05] exciting times here brother bram says
[1:37:08] oh i'm so glad to know
[1:37:12] that we are living here in these last
[1:37:14] days
[1:37:16] here i believe that we are living in one
[1:37:19] of the most
[1:37:20] tremendous times that the world ever
[1:37:23] has ever known just on the eve of the
[1:37:27] coming of the lord
[1:37:29] isn't that wonderful think that
[1:37:32] most any time now all scriptures
[1:37:35] just about fulfilled and so we are
[1:37:38] expecting him
[1:37:40] at any moment and we should live
[1:37:43] under those kind of expectations
