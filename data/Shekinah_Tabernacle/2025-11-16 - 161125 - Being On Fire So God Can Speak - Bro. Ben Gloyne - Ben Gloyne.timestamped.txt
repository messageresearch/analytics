[6:18] Good Morning.
[6:25] We were doing a mic check when we had
[6:28] had
[6:30] at a little church in Gizbon. [music] We
[6:32] were setting something up and um it was
[6:36] um Marcus Maloney had to [music]
[6:39] do a little mic check and um
[6:43] when he got up there and spoke into
[6:44] [music] the mic he said uh good morning
[6:47] friends.
[6:50] I thought that's good. I know what he's
[6:51] been listening to. [laughter]
[6:54] Well, good evening, friends. So, good
[6:57] [music] morning, friends.
[6:59] How are you? You good? You ready to
[7:00] praise the Lord? You all refreshed and
[7:02] had a good sleep and ready to just give
[7:04] your all to the kingdom of God this
[7:05] morning and hear the word of God and and
[7:07] and leave this place more victorious
[7:10] than what you are right now.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're we're in we're
[7:14] amongst great company this morning. Then
[7:16] let's um let's [music] stand and let's
[7:19] um let's invite the Lord to be here with
[7:21] us. Lord Jesus, we thank you, Lord, that
[7:23] we can walk in victory, Lord, when we're
[7:25] walking with you, Lord, that there's so
[7:27] much strength, Lord, and and so much
[7:29] power in your presence in your spirit,
[7:31] Lord. That's an an everlasting stream,
[7:34] Lord, of love and of power, Lord, and of
[7:36] a sound mind. So, we just thank you,
[7:38] Lord. May you just refresh each heart
[7:40] this morning with the Holy Ghost.
[7:42] Lord, we know that we go through many
[7:44] [music] ups and downs, Lord, but if we
[7:46] just are continually filled with your
[7:48] with your spirit, Lord, [music] it just
[7:49] we can make it through everything that
[7:51] that comes our way, Lord. So, we just
[7:52] want to humbly invite you into our
[7:54] presence. You said where two or three
[7:55] are gathered in your name that there you
[7:56] are in the midst. So, we just know that
[7:58] by faith you're here with us this
[8:00] morning, Lord. [music] May just bless
[8:01] us. Bless the songs. Bless the the word,
[8:04] Lord. May we receive it as being from
[8:06] you and not just a natural experience,
[8:08] Lord, but we draw on the gift, Lord, and
[8:11] that you speak to our hearts this
[8:12] morning. So, we just pray and we just
[8:13] commit the service to your hands in
[8:15] Jesus name. Amen. I was just listening
[8:18] to a
[8:20] sermon last night and this um
[8:25] I fell asleep then I woke up and I heard
[8:27] this but it really blessed me. It says
[8:30] um brother says, [music] "I tell you
[8:32] that's a very good thing to preach on."
[8:33] And he's talking about John that
[8:35] preached on um loving little children
[8:37] love one another. And he says little
[8:38] children love one another. He said as I
[8:40] get old in the ministry now and my about
[8:43] in my 21st year I think all the time as
[8:46] I go along that this the more I think of
[8:48] the Lord Jesus the more I begin to find
[8:50] out that it's love that covers the whole
[8:52] thing. The love of God that's the love
[8:55] of God shed abroad in our heart by the
[8:57] Holy Spirit. You know, and as you go
[8:59] through the ups and the downs, the
[9:01] highs, the lows,
[9:03] the church, the work, the family, the
[9:05] whatever you might go through, you you
[9:06] begin to realize, you know, it's just
[9:07] it's really the love of God in every
[9:09] situation.
[9:11] When you let that come through, and
[9:12] whatever situation it might be, it's
[9:13] that it's that that just holds it all
[9:15] together. You know, it refreshes us. It
[9:17] it just, as Brother Brandham said,
[9:19] [music] the more I begin to find out
[9:21] that it's love that covers the whole
[9:22] thing. So, may the love of God just um
[9:24] fill us this morning. Let's sing um He's
[9:26] still in the fire and he's walking in
[9:28] the flame. Uh let's go with the Let's
[9:30] start with the chorus. Well, he's still
[9:33] in the fire and he's [music] walking in

[10:04] How the wicked king commanded they be
[10:07] thrown [music] into the flame because
[10:10] they would not bow and then deny their
[10:13] father's name.
[10:16] Mama said the king stood high upon the
[10:19] balcony so tall. And when he looked up,
[10:23] he was shocked by all the [music] things
[10:25] he saw because he thought that he would
[10:28] finally lay it dead upon the ground. But
[10:31] instead [music]

[40:29] pray together. Amen. Lord Jesus, that's
[40:31] what we want to do. Give ourselves to
[40:34] you, oh God. You said in your word, he
[40:35] that keeps his life shall lose it. He
[40:38] that loses his life for your sake shall
[40:40] keep it, Lord. [music] So, Father, we
[40:42] can't uh keep our lives by keeping it to
[40:44] ourselves. We got to give ourselves away
[40:46] to you, Lord. You can live, you can have
[40:48] your way, dear God. I pray you'd anoint
[40:50] the service, Lord God. Touch every life
[40:52] here. Touch those streaming, Lord God.
[40:54] Thank you. You're a personal God. We can
[40:56] come together in this manner, Lord, to
[40:58] Lord, glorify your great name. May you
[41:00] just move among us, Father. Touch the
[41:02] sick and needy in body and in spirit
[41:04] this day. We thank you, Lord. Have your
[41:06] way, Lord. Bless your word as we're
[41:07] about to read it to in Jesus Christ's
[41:09] name. [music]
[41:10] Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Good to see everyone. Praise the Lord.
[41:14] Amen. God bless you. So, what? Yep. You
[41:17] can musicians, you can have your seats
[41:20] and um you can all have your seats.
[41:21] Actually, just want to give a real quick
[41:22] trip report. So, greetings from the
[41:24] Philippines. Wonderful time. Um what's
[41:28] happened here? Have I broken it? No.
[41:31] Okay. So, thank you for your prayers
[41:33] first and foremost. Now, can we see
[41:35] that? You probably can't see that too
[41:37] well. So, um there was a couple of
[41:39] typhoons before and during when I was
[41:41] there. I got a couple of messages I
[41:43] think Sunday or Saturday morning saying,
[41:45] "Are you okay?" Okay, cuz he was a super
[41:46] typhoon. Um, so this um I wish I had a
[41:49] pointer, but so this bottom line here,
[41:51] you can see that's the path of the
[41:53] storms, right? So the so the bottom one
[41:55] was a um typhoon that went through I
[41:57] think a couple of days before I arrived
[41:59] and then in the red there was a super
[42:00] typhoon that made landfall north of
[42:02] Manila. Um thankfully we were um un
[42:06] unscathed. Uh we yeah was uh barely any
[42:09] problems there, but uh quite a few
[42:11] people um lost their lives in these
[42:13] typhoons. So, it was it really impacted
[42:16] people. I don't know if you can read the
[42:18] numbers, but you know, there was um a
[42:20] lot of people affected uh in both of
[42:22] those storms. A lot of people. But we
[42:24] thank you for your prayers. They kind of
[42:26] passed us by. We're in the middle of it.
[42:28] We were unaffected, but it affected a
[42:30] lot of people's travel. Um
[42:31] unfortunately, um Pastor Angel couldn't
[42:34] come and come down. That would have been
[42:35] wonderful. But next time we'll see
[42:37] brother John Bravo's um dad. So, uh
[42:40] yeah, but thank you for your prayers
[42:42] there. Um, so the Philippines is a
[42:44] different place. It's amazing, you know.
[42:46] It's it's like so the greater Manila
[42:48] area. So there's 115 million people in
[42:51] the country. 40 million of those live in
[42:54] the greater Manila area. This is eight
[42:56] times New Zealand in this kind of
[42:58] metropolis of this is this is what I
[43:00] woke up to the first morning. There's um
[43:02] a school is doing a fire evacuation
[43:04] drill. There's lots of people around.
[43:06] You know, those are all school kids um
[43:08] holding their bags. I'm sorry there's no
[43:10] sound, but there's a lot of noise. big
[43:12] cities, there's a lot of noise. So, um,
[43:14] but the believers are amazing there. Um,
[43:17] I try and skip through this, so I don't
[43:18] want to turn it into like this tourist
[43:19] video, you know, but, um, then, so, you
[43:22] know, there's a lot of traffic. Um, this
[43:24] doesn't do it justice, but there's heaps
[43:26] of, um, motorbikes. There's like there's
[43:29] no I think road rules are a guideline
[43:31] there. You know, you kind of just pull
[43:33] in and you toot your horn and everyone
[43:35] knows where everyone's going somehow.
[43:36] It's incredible. You know, New Zealand
[43:38] couldn't cope with this deal. you know,
[43:40] people would be road raging and stuff
[43:41] here, but yeah, it just kind of works
[43:42] where there's a sea of traffic and
[43:44] people and um Yeah. Yeah. So, it's quite
[43:47] amazing. Um yeah, so this side streets
[43:49] are very narrow. Don't know if that
[43:51] Yeah. So, somehow they kind of drive
[43:53] through there with vehicles, not just
[43:55] motorbikes. They're like the kings of
[43:57] tight spaces. It's amazing how they fit
[43:59] in and they build everything. And um
[44:01] anyway, so we went there for brother Ron
[44:02] Malivu's church anniversary. So, that's
[44:04] him in the middle there. Um so he's been
[44:07] out here um many years ago. Um but he
[44:10] came to the Lord. So when he was young,
[44:12] so this is the 31st year anniversary for
[44:14] their fellowship. When he came to the
[44:16] Lord, well before that he was he was a
[44:18] rock and roll. He had a rock and roll
[44:19] band playing in pubs on drugs. That was
[44:21] him. Then God began to deal with his
[44:23] life. Eventually he came to the message.
[44:25] He'd been through many different
[44:26] denominations. Nothing satisfied until
[44:28] this word found him, transformed his
[44:30] life. So that's um so that's brother Ron
[44:32] in the middle. Uh to to to my left
[44:35] that's um Pastor Clement from Zimbabwe.
[44:37] He's a good friend of uh brother David
[44:39] Gonzalez who came later but um he wanted
[44:41] to come and experience the Philippines.
[44:44] So he came. He was a real blessing. And
[44:45] then to the taller brother to brother
[44:47] Ron's his right. We're going this way.
[44:50] Um so that's um uh that's brother
[44:53] Kendall from from uh Canada and he does
[44:56] mission work. He goes preaches there.
[44:57] He's like 28 years old. And uh he was it
[45:00] was interesting like after I preached at
[45:01] the min I mean I'm at the anniversary
[45:03] meeting he came met me all excited he's
[45:05] like do you see the pillar of fire do
[45:07] you see the pillar of fire I'm like no
[45:08] I've never seen the pillar of fire said
[45:09] well I saw him today he was there he was
[45:11] there in the meeting you know so I mean
[45:13] the the angel of the lord accompanies
[45:14] the word
[45:16] &gt;&gt; okay so if you have the word the angel
[45:17] of the lord accompanies you right amen
[45:19] but anyway he was super excited by that
[45:21] and um yeah it was real nice to get to
[45:23] know him uh he just came virtually out
[45:25] of the world too God found him at
[45:26] university I felt like I was talking to
[45:28] my former self in a way. But anyway,
[45:31] it's just quite neat how God works, you
[45:33] know. And then to the left of well to
[45:35] the right of him, so to our left, that's
[45:37] u that's pastor Michael Nutter. He's the
[45:40] only message pastor in Korea.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; There's only one church in Korea. He's
[45:46] the pastor of it. He's um so so he's
[45:49] full-blooded Korean, but he was raised
[45:50] he was a war baby, war orphan from the
[45:52] Korean War. Uh he was adopted into the
[45:54] States and raised there. Uh he was a
[45:56] Baptist minister, different things. when
[45:58] this message came his way,
[46:00] changed his life. Praise the Lord. So
[46:03] anyway, that's uh yes, that's who was
[46:04] there. Um yes, he spoke as well. It was
[46:07] great to finally meet him, seeing that
[46:08] sister Hannah and Esther are there
[46:10] already. So trying to get them to meet
[46:12] up and things and you know, have some
[46:14] fellowship and yeah, but yeah, it's um
[46:17] so there was um so at the anniversary
[46:19] meetings, this is all the pastors and
[46:21] ministers there. There was about 25
[46:23] churches represented. They hired this
[46:25] hall. they can only fit so many people
[46:27] so they couldn't not everyone could just
[46:28] come but um brother Ron does a lot of
[46:30] mission work among the Filipino people
[46:33] uh so a lot of those brothers are from
[46:35] different parts of the country uh few of
[46:38] them came out of say the two souls
[46:39] doctrine different false doctrines he
[46:41] went and just taught them the word and
[46:42] brought them out so he's done a lot of
[46:44] work for people there has a real heart
[46:45] to see people really know the Lord and
[46:48] um and then we had so after um after
[46:51] that that was the Saturday uh we had the
[46:53] anniversary meetings I just had two
[46:55] services there and um and then we had so
[46:57] brother David Gonzalez and his wife um
[47:00] they um they send their greetings,
[47:03] sister Joanne because I think your
[47:04] sister's there with them, right? Yeah.
[47:06] So um yeah, they send their greetings
[47:07] and I thought it was special to meet
[47:08] them because I don't know who was who
[47:10] remembers when they came through through
[47:12] through Wellington and spoke.
[47:16] Yeah. He was our first ever visiting
[47:18] minister back in the day.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Like back in the day day. Okay. So, it
[47:23] was nice to catch up with them again.
[47:24] They're doing well. So, yeah, it was
[47:26] really really neat to meet them. Um, we
[47:29] don't have any um maybe we'll just um we
[47:33] don't have any audio. Maybe I could just
[47:35] Yeah, I was going to do like a big uh
[47:36] video bomb on WhatsApp. Maybe I'll do
[47:38] that later. Anyway, this is them
[47:39] speaking. I mean I mean I mean singing
[47:41] very musical people. Brother Kabin, I
[47:43] thought you'd enjoy this. You see the
[47:44] the matchy matchy? They do this every
[47:47] year,
[47:48] different colors. So I just gave someone
[47:51] some inspiration and uh church choirs.
[47:53] Tell you what, they can sing. That's a
[47:56] real Yeah, it was just real good
[47:57] atmosphere. And then so that was the um
[47:59] Saturday. Um then um Sunday morning
[48:02] we're at brother Ron's church um and
[48:05] this is Yeah, this is a church. It's
[48:07] like a five-story building. Very well
[48:09] built with different build um areas and
[48:11] things and um in uh in a very tight
[48:14] space. And then we had the youth
[48:15] banquet. Um, and one thing I thought was
[48:18] neat with the youth banquet is they had
[48:19] a sign-in thing. This is not everyone,
[48:21] but you had to draw your your picture as
[48:24] you sign in. So, it's pretty cool.
[48:25] Anyway, so I'm there somewhere. Um, and
[48:27] then so they had the youth banquet from
[48:29] churches from all around and not
[48:32] everyone could come because of the
[48:33] typhoons and so on, but many different
[48:35] uh people came and it [snorts] really
[48:38] So, a lot of the young people, they said
[48:41] their fire was reit.
[48:44] God really did a lot for a lot of people
[48:46] in these over these times when I was
[48:48] there. It really people were you know
[48:50] you know they had storms come through
[48:53] people you know who are organizing part
[48:55] of the church organizing the special
[48:56] meetings. It felt like they had just
[48:58] lived out what we live out before our
[49:00] camp. You know, the devil's fighting,
[49:02] there's trouble, there's fussing,
[49:03] there's problems, all these kind of
[49:04] things. The devil trying to upset the
[49:06] apple cart, you know, but God, you know,
[49:08] if you know, if we just keep the course,
[49:11] God always turns up on his time, right?
[49:13] So, yeah, but a lot of them, they, you
[49:14] know, a lot of the young people here,
[49:16] they um yeah, they said their fire got
[49:18] lit. They're going through things.
[49:20] Prodals coming home wayward, just
[49:23] drifting. But then God got a hold of
[49:24] them through the word of God. So, it was
[49:26] incredible time in that regard, you
[49:28] know. So, we really thank the Lord for
[49:29] all your prayers. Sorry, it's very
[49:31] brief, but I kind of try and keep these
[49:32] things brief, but God's God lives. The
[49:35] same God there is the same God here.
[49:37] Okay? I felt like I was at home over
[49:38] there. Just the liberty, just the love,
[49:40] just wonderful people. If you ever get a
[49:42] chance, go there and have a visit.
[49:45] You'll be blessed. Amen. So,
[49:48] um don't know if we have any more things
[49:51] to Yeah. But yeah, that's the youth
[49:53] banquet. Oh, wait. Sorry. So that was
[49:54] the youth banquet. They hired another
[49:56] place. Man, their musicians have a lot
[49:58] of fun. I thought of you, Jimmy. You
[50:00] should have seen them. [laughter]
[50:02] But lovely people. They love the Lord.
[50:04] Have some real testimonies, experiences,
[50:06] but just real genuine Christian people.
[50:09] And um yeah, it was it was really
[50:12] special. So, [snorts] amen. So, let's um
[50:14] let's stand this morning. I'm sorry
[50:17] that's very brief. You say, "Well, what
[50:18] else happened?" Well, I'm happy. You go
[50:20] to a place, fire of God falls on people,
[50:23] they take that fire home. I think that's
[50:24] pretty good.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you know, see the Holy Ghost
[50:27] move like that. It was really, really
[50:29] special. So, um, thank you for your
[50:31] prayers so much. Amen. So, we're just
[50:32] going to read from, um, first Peter
[50:35] 4:12-16. I, I, um,
[50:38] preached this, uh, in a way over there,
[50:40] and I just really enjoyed it, so I'm
[50:42] going to preach it here. That's okay.
[50:44] And, um, I'm still probably 5 hours in
[50:46] the past somewhere kind of rejuggling,
[50:49] but um, yeah. So, just bear with me this
[50:51] morning. But, let's read here. 1 Peter 4
[50:53] and 12 down to uh 16, he says, "Beloved,
[50:58] think not strange concerning the fiery
[51:00] trial which is to try you as though some
[51:02] strange thing happened unto you. But
[51:04] rejoice in so much as ye are partakers
[51:06] of Christ's sufferings, that when his
[51:08] glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad
[51:10] also with exceeding joy. If ye be
[51:13] reproached for the name of Christ, happy
[51:15] are ye. For the spirit of glory and the
[51:18] God of um and of God resteth upon you.
[51:21] On their part he is evil spoken of, but
[51:23] on your part he is glorified. But let
[51:25] none of you suffer as a murderer or as a
[51:27] thief or as an evildoer or as a busy
[51:29] body in other men's matters. Yet if any
[51:31] man suffer as a Christian, let him be
[51:33] not ashamed, but let him glorify God on
[51:35] this behalf. Amen. And then we just got
[51:38] one more scripture from Revelations
[51:40] chapter 3. Also like to thank brother
[51:42] Isaac and brother Jimmy for speaking. I
[51:44] I either stream those or watch them
[51:46] later. Those are real blessings. So,
[51:47] thank you so much. Thank you for all
[51:49] those who helped uh my family keep going
[51:51] when I was away. Um Jenny and and and
[51:54] Stephanie, different ones really
[51:55] appreciate that too. Uh thank you so
[51:57] much. Uh so, Revelations 3 and 14. And
[51:59] unto the angel of the church, the lady
[52:00] of right these things sayeth the amen,
[52:02] the faithful and true witness, the
[52:04] beginning of the creation of God. I know
[52:06] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[52:08] hot or would that thou work cold or hot.
[52:11] So then, because thou art lukewarm,
[52:13] neither cold or hot, I will spew thee
[52:14] out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I
[52:16] am rich, increase with goods, and need
[52:18] of nothing, knowest not that thou art
[52:20] wretched and miserable, poor and blind
[52:22] and naked. I can count counsel thee to
[52:24] buy of me gold tried in the fire, thou
[52:26] mayest be rich, and white raignment,
[52:28] thou mayest be clothed, at the same uh
[52:30] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[52:31] appear, and anoint thine eyes with um
[52:34] Isav that thou mayest see. Amen. May the
[52:37] Lord bless the reading of his word. You
[52:38] can have your seats. Um, this morning I
[52:41] want to speak about being the mouthpiece
[52:43] of God. Okay, this is very important.
[52:46] This is the age where the voice of God
[52:48] is in the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[52:51] So,
[52:52] you know, as we look at this here, we've
[52:54] got to realize that everything happens
[52:56] for a reason. Okay? We're not going
[52:58] through life just just being battered
[52:59] and bruised and, you know, going through
[53:01] a trial and no, no. Every trial is is is
[53:05] for our good. Now I was looking at this
[53:07] the other day. This is when I was uh
[53:09] traveling or something and you know just
[53:11] a thought came to mind. Why does Peter
[53:13] call it a fiery trial? Why is it not a
[53:16] cold trial or just a hard trial or just
[53:20] a trial? Why is it fiery? Now fire fire
[53:23] produces heat. Amen. Now fire produces
[53:26] heat. Now God wants us to be not
[53:28] lukewarm as we read the um read there in
[53:30] Revelations chapter 3 that the penalty
[53:32] of this age or the or the major
[53:34] complaint of this age is being lukewarm.
[53:36] This is a lukewarm age. But just because
[53:38] the age is lukewarm, it doesn't mean we
[53:40] have to be lukewarm as well. No, but God
[53:42] doesn't want us to be that way. He has
[53:44] conditioned us actually to be fiery hot.
[53:46] Amen. This is how God has actually made
[53:48] us is that everything we go through, the
[53:50] reason they're called fiery trials is
[53:52] it's a heat. Amen. It causes us to be
[53:55] more on fire for God because you realize
[53:57] when a trial strikes you, you may not
[53:59] understand what you're going through,
[54:00] but it causes you to be more sincere, be
[54:02] more dedicated, draw closer to God.
[54:04] Amen. It doesn't cause you to go the
[54:06] other way. It actually pulls you into
[54:08] the presence of God. And what does that
[54:09] do? That makes you more on fire. Amen.
[54:11] It makes you more hot, makes you more
[54:13] fervent. Doesn't make you lukewarm.
[54:15] Doesn't make you indifferent. Doesn't
[54:16] make you cold. We don't sit back and
[54:18] say, "Lord, this is not fair." We say,
[54:19] "God, we know everything's working for
[54:20] our good." Amen. God, you're going to
[54:22] produce deity in my life through this
[54:25] trial.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what God's going
[54:27] to do, right? So, this is this is the
[54:30] age of of lukewarmness, but we are not
[54:33] lukewarm, cuz God wants us to be hot.
[54:36] That's why trials are called fiery, as
[54:38] Peter would say, the fiery trials. You
[54:40] got to realize every trial you go
[54:42] through is fire. It's to heat you up.
[54:44] It's not a freezer. It's not an ice box.
[54:47] It's not a cooler. It's not a wet
[54:49] blanket. There may be wet blankets
[54:51] around you, but eventually they will
[54:52] catch fire, too. Amen. You just let the
[54:54] fire of God burn in you and consume
[54:56] everything around you. It'll take care
[54:58] of those things. But every trial, you
[55:00] got to realize, I'm sure you as people
[55:02] look at me, you know, you think actually
[55:03] every trial has made you more sincere.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; You may be broken, you may be bruised,
[55:08] you may be whatever more, but it makes
[55:10] you more sincere. That makes you more on
[55:12] fire. Remember, because it takes
[55:14] sincerity to bind the ma. As brother
[55:16] Bram saw that vision, he was twothirds
[55:18] of the promised land walking on the
[55:20] path. He saw that black mumber like that
[55:22] snake come out and trying to bite his
[55:23] friend and he's interceding for him. And
[55:25] you know then but then but then you know
[55:27] the prophet was wondering what can I do?
[55:29] How am I going to deal with this? And
[55:31] God said that it takes sincerity to bind
[55:34] him. This is this represents death and
[55:36] everything under it. So he just prayed
[55:38] God make me more sincere. So even in
[55:41] this vision he was going through a trial
[55:42] but it was it wasn't making him
[55:44] lukewarm. was making him more sincere.
[55:46] And and brother and the Lord told him,
[55:48] "You must be more sincere to bind this
[55:50] spirit." Amen. He says he said, "Lord,
[55:53] forgive me. Make me more sincere." Amen.
[55:55] And then he and then he had power and he
[55:57] spoke to that thing when it tried to
[55:58] come against him. Now, it couldn't bite
[56:00] him because he had he had a a he had a
[56:04] force field, amen, of the Holy Ghost
[56:06] that that death could not strike his
[56:08] soul. We to realize the devil can get
[56:10] our hit our body, hit our spirit. That
[56:12] doesn't mean we're not a Christian. That
[56:14] doesn't mean we're not saved. I'm just
[56:16] going to pour it on thick this morning,
[56:17] okay? That doesn't mean we're not have
[56:19] unbelief. That doesn't mean we've done
[56:21] something wrong. No. God allows every
[56:24] spirit to come against us. Amen. Cuz he
[56:26] wants to prove our faith. He wants it to
[56:28] be a fiery trial. He wants it to anoint
[56:30] us that he can speak through us. That
[56:32] it's not just God speaking through the
[56:34] prophet. He's God speaking through you.
[56:36] Amen. He wants to take your vocal cords
[56:38] and speak. Amen. Just like he spoke
[56:40] through the prophets of old, through
[56:41] brother Brandham, through the Lord Jesus
[56:43] being God himself, that same God wants
[56:45] to live in you and speak. Amen. So
[56:47] that's why now that power was given to
[56:48] brother Bram to bind that mambber.
[56:50] Right? But that same power is not just
[56:52] with him. It's with you. Amen. Cuz it
[56:54] was the anointing of God and the prophet
[56:56] that bound that mumber. It wasn't him
[56:57] and his humanity. It was God speaking.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; You're in that condition this morning.
[57:04] If you have the baptism of the Holy
[57:05] Ghost, you can bind every unclean
[57:07] spirit. Amen. every spirit that comes
[57:09] against you that see it can't bite your
[57:11] soul. You got to realize that. Amen. It
[57:13] can bother you. You can get sick. You
[57:15] can have a mind battle. That doesn't
[57:16] mean you're not a Christian. That
[57:18] doesn't mean you're not overcoming. That
[57:19] doesn't mean you're not filled with the
[57:21] Holy Ghost. Amen. That just shows you're
[57:23] a human being. But you've got a you've
[57:25] got a greater that's he that's in you
[57:26] than he that's in the world. Amen. Power
[57:28] of God, the life of God within you that
[57:31] can overcome all those things. So that
[57:33] thing couldn't bite him, but it could
[57:35] bite his friend. So, you see, this is
[57:37] why we've got to be very sensitive and
[57:39] aware to what others are going through.
[57:40] Amen. Because we may be all on the same
[57:42] path, but it doesn't mean everyone's got
[57:44] the Holy Ghost. Eventually, we all will.
[57:46] That's why we have church, is it not?
[57:48] Amen. That God would touch lives, refill
[57:50] us that have the Holy Ghost. If no one
[57:52] has the Holy Ghost, that they would meet
[57:54] God and receive the Holy Ghost. That's
[57:56] that's part of why we have church. Would
[57:58] grow and mature in the Lord. Amen. So,
[58:00] what did he do? He interceded for his
[58:02] friend. He bound that mumber and then he
[58:04] could see well just to see if I've
[58:05] really got power to loose or to bind I
[58:07] loose you and the and the thing became a
[58:09] live snake again. Then he bound it and
[58:11] became like a you and symbol. He stood
[58:14] he he said there he stood he meshed on
[58:15] it for a while.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:18] I just like that that's free. But you
[58:21] know that power is within you this
[58:23] morning.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; It's within you. You say oh one day one
[58:26] day. No no today. Today we're the sons
[58:28] and daughters of God today. Amen. And
[58:30] God has placed us in the body of Christ.
[58:32] Today we are the bride of Christ. Today
[58:34] we have dominion. We are kings and
[58:36] priests to our God today. Oh, one day in
[58:38] the millennium. No, today you've been
[58:40] made in that condition. Today God has
[58:42] placed you there. So why not use your
[58:44] position? Amen. Why not actually take
[58:46] God at his word? Let him speak through
[58:48] you and deal with every situation of
[58:50] your life. [snorts]
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This is why we rejoice
[58:55] when it's fiery trials. You realize
[58:57] God's going to speak.
[58:59] God's going to speak.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Remember, many times we just let let the
[59:02] devil speak and we leave it there. You
[59:04] got to realize when the devil comes,
[59:05] God's going to come.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the devil touched Job,
[59:10] but Job stood on that sacrifice of the
[59:12] blood of the lamb waiting. Then God
[59:14] spoke in his time.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Dealt with the whole thing.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm just going to read
[59:19] this a bit. Hope you don't mind. But
[59:21] this is just from the church age book.
[59:22] Says we're going to look at this
[59:23] carefully. It says that this lady in
[59:26] church age group is lukewarm. This
[59:28] lukewarmness demands a penalty from God.
[59:30] The penalty is that they will be spewed
[59:32] out of his mouth. Here is where we don't
[59:34] want to go astray as a lot of folks do.
[59:37] They are very un they very unwisely say
[59:40] that God can spew out of his mouth. And
[59:43] that proves there's no such thing as any
[59:45] truth of the doctrine of the
[59:46] perseverance of the saint. Um yeah, if
[59:49] that's how you say that word. I want to
[59:50] correct your thinking right now. This
[59:52] verse does not uh is not given to an
[59:54] individual. It's given to the church. He
[59:56] is talking to the church. Furthermore,
[59:58] if you just keep the word uh in mind,
[1:00:02] you'll recall that nowhere does it say
[1:00:03] we are in the mouth of God. We're
[1:00:06] engraved on his palms. We're carried in
[1:00:08] his bosom way back in the unknown ages
[1:00:10] before time. We were in his mind. We are
[1:00:12] in his sheepfold and in his pastures,
[1:00:15] but never in his mouth. But what is in
[1:00:16] the mouth of the Lord? The word is in
[1:00:19] his mouth. Matthew 4:4. But he answered
[1:00:20] and said, "It is written, man shall not
[1:00:23] live by bread alone, but by every word
[1:00:24] that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[1:00:26] The word is supposed to be in our
[1:00:28] mouths, too." Now, we know that the
[1:00:30] church is his body. It is here taking
[1:00:33] his place. What will be in the mouth of
[1:00:35] the church? The word. 1 Peter 4:11, "If
[1:00:38] any man speak, let him speak as the
[1:00:40] oracles, the word of God." Second Peter
[1:00:42] 1:21, for the prophecy came not an old
[1:00:45] time by the will of man, but holy men of
[1:00:47] God spake as they were moved by the Holy
[1:00:50] Ghost. Then what is wrong with these
[1:00:51] people of the last day? They've gotten
[1:00:53] away from the word. They're no longer
[1:00:55] fervent about it. They are lukewarm.
[1:00:58] They are lukewarm about it. And I'm
[1:01:00] going to prove that right now. So it
[1:01:02] says, "Let uh if any man speak, let him
[1:01:04] speak as the oracles of God." Now, if we
[1:01:07] could categorize what we speak through
[1:01:09] the day, what category does it fall
[1:01:11] under? Is it gossip? Is it malice? Is it
[1:01:15] strife? Is it unbelief? Is it
[1:01:17] insecurity? Is it doubt? What are you
[1:01:20] speaking to one another? Or is it faith?
[1:01:23] Is it love? Is there strength in your
[1:01:26] words? Does it stabilize? Does it bring
[1:01:28] peace? Do you speak promises?
[1:01:31] Because the word of God should be in our
[1:01:33] mouth.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. What does that word say? Thine and
[1:01:37] thy house shall be saved.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's my shepherd. He's my shelter.
[1:01:42] He's my strong tower. He's my strength.
[1:01:45] He's my guide. Amen. He's my all and
[1:01:47] all. Are those the things that come out
[1:01:50] of our mouth? If we could categorize
[1:01:51] everything that we say in a day. Oh, but
[1:01:53] what about work and all? Yeah, we're
[1:01:54] going to talk about natural things, but
[1:01:56] what kind of if I can put it's probably
[1:01:58] not the right word, but what kind of
[1:01:59] spin do you put upon it? Yes, there's
[1:02:01] problems, but what how do you talk about
[1:02:03] the problem? Oh, we can't deal with it.
[1:02:05] No, that's not a that's not what a
[1:02:07] believer says. A believer says, "Yeah,
[1:02:08] the problem's there, but the one in me
[1:02:10] can move that problem."
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The one in me can take care of
[1:02:14] that problem. There's nothing. You know,
[1:02:15] Brother Brham said about the thief on
[1:02:17] the cross that repented. He actually
[1:02:19] said God never entered. Not a single
[1:02:21] thought of God entered into his mind
[1:02:23] until that moment.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; It was this predestinated moment. But he
[1:02:28] wasn't thinking about God all the time.
[1:02:30] He didn't even think about God until
[1:02:31] that moment that he saw the lamb of God
[1:02:33] manifested in front of him.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say Lord, fill our mouth with your
[1:02:37] word. Lord, fill our actions with you,
[1:02:39] Lord Jesus. That when people come across
[1:02:41] our path, God will come on their mind
[1:02:43] and they'll start thinking about him and
[1:02:45] God will start convicting them.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Are we all okay this morning? You know,
[1:02:51] I pray that God would live through us in
[1:02:53] such a way that people actually begin to
[1:02:54] think about the Lord and their state
[1:02:57] with him. Amen. And and they don't stay
[1:02:59] lost, they get found.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just sorry, I just cut out a
[1:03:03] paragraph. You can read this more in the
[1:03:04] church church age book. He says, "Now,
[1:03:06] right down to the line to uh come to the
[1:03:08] Pentecostals. They have the word. Give
[1:03:10] them the word test and see." They'll
[1:03:12] sell out the word for manifestation at
[1:03:14] just about every time. If you can
[1:03:16] produce a manifestation like oil and
[1:03:18] blood and tongues and other signs,
[1:03:19] whether in the word or not, or whether
[1:03:21] properly interpreted from the word, the
[1:03:23] majority will fall for it. But what has
[1:03:25] happened to the word? The word has been
[1:03:27] put aside. So God says, "I'm going to go
[1:03:29] against you all. I'll spew out of my
[1:03:31] mouth. This is the end." For seven out
[1:03:33] of seven ages, I've seen nothing but men
[1:03:36] esteeming their own word above mine. So
[1:03:38] the end of this age, I'm spewing you out
[1:03:40] of my mouth. It's all over. I'm going to
[1:03:42] I'm going to speak. All right. Yes, I'm
[1:03:44] here in the midst of the church. The
[1:03:45] amen of God, the faithful and true, will
[1:03:47] reveal himself. It will be by my
[1:03:49] prophet. Oh yes, it is so. Revelations
[1:03:51] 10:7. the days of the voice of the
[1:03:53] seventh uh messenger when he shall begin
[1:03:56] to sound. The mystery of God shall be
[1:03:57] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:03:59] servants the prophets. There it is. He's
[1:04:01] sending a vindicated prophet. He's
[1:04:02] sending a prophet after almost 2,000
[1:04:04] years. He's sending someone who's so far
[1:04:06] from organization and education and the
[1:04:08] word of religion, a world of religion.
[1:04:10] That is John the Baptist and Elijah of
[1:04:12] old. He will speak only from God. And
[1:04:14] he'll have thus sayeth the Lord and
[1:04:16] speak for God. He'll be God's
[1:04:18] mouthpiece. And he, as it is declared in
[1:04:20] Malachi 4:6, will turn the hearts of the
[1:04:22] children back to the fathers. He will
[1:04:24] bring the elect of the last days, and
[1:04:26] they will hear a vindicated prophet give
[1:04:28] an exact truth as it was with Paul. He
[1:04:31] will restore the truth as they had it.
[1:04:33] And those elect with him in that day
[1:04:35] will be the ones that will truly
[1:04:36] manifest the Lord. Amen. And be his body
[1:04:39] and be his voice and perform his works.
[1:04:41] Hallelujah. Do you see it? Amen. So,
[1:04:44] there's a group of people in the land
[1:04:46] that are his body. I'm going to I'm
[1:04:48] going to speak about that a following
[1:04:49] Sunday or something. I've been enjoying
[1:04:51] just the thought of it anyway. I'll
[1:04:52] leave that for later. But you see there
[1:04:54] there are people who are not lukewarm,
[1:04:57] not indifferent. No, but they got a fire
[1:04:59] in their soul. I mean, a passion for,
[1:05:02] you know, for the Lord in spite of
[1:05:03] whatever go, you know, the devil throws
[1:05:05] against them. Amen. It all it is is a
[1:05:08] fiery trial that just heats up the
[1:05:10] furnace. I mean, heats them up. And that
[1:05:12] fire isn't there to destroy you. It's
[1:05:15] there to keep you warm. Amen. And it's
[1:05:16] there to give life. Amen. Remember, fire
[1:05:18] gives life. The sun is a ball of fire.
[1:05:22] If that turned off, where would we be?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; We'd be an icicle floating like there
[1:05:27] any other planet, right? But because
[1:05:29] it's there, because we're in the right
[1:05:30] position, all those things, we have life
[1:05:32] on this planet.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And because the word of God isn't
[1:05:36] now, it's not distant somewhere, but the
[1:05:39] word of God is neither even in thy mouth
[1:05:41] and thy heart. Amen. That fire is in the
[1:05:42] right position. Amen. that God can
[1:05:45] speak. Who's ever had the experience
[1:05:47] you've prayed and you know it's not you
[1:05:49] praying?
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; What's that? That's that's actually God
[1:05:52] taking your lips and speaking. Who's
[1:05:55] ever spoken something to someone you
[1:05:56] realize it's not you and God proves it
[1:05:58] to be him.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; That's not you speaking. That's him
[1:06:01] speaking. See people see see the church
[1:06:03] world, they just think, well, if you
[1:06:05] think of something and speak it,
[1:06:06] therefore it's God. No, that's just
[1:06:09] human carnality. just an impersonation
[1:06:11] trying to put a scarecrow in front of
[1:06:13] the, you know, in front of the fact that
[1:06:15] God is speaking through his body in the
[1:06:17] last days. See, the true bride of Christ
[1:06:20] isn't trying to just think of things
[1:06:22] they like to say and humanly say it and
[1:06:24] say, "Oh, that's God." No, it's God
[1:06:26] takes your vocal cords and speaks
[1:06:28] through you without you even realizing
[1:06:30] it. It's like the same with Isaiah
[1:06:32] prophesying, "A virgin shall conceive."
[1:06:34] You know, Brother Bram said if he was
[1:06:35] conscious of what he was saying, he
[1:06:36] probably wouldn't have said it because
[1:06:37] it seemed so impossible. But yet God
[1:06:40] spoke that through his lips.
[1:06:42] Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; See, we must not let this world call us
[1:06:46] down.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; No, God puts you through a trial. And
[1:06:49] it's not because Wait, let's just
[1:06:51] continue this. I feel like I I got to
[1:06:53] behave. Okay. Now, a momentary
[1:06:54] consideration of church history will
[1:06:56] prove how accurate that thought is. In
[1:06:58] the last ages, the world the word was
[1:07:01] almost entirely lost to the people. But
[1:07:03] God sent Luther with the word. The
[1:07:04] Lutheran spoke for God at that time, but
[1:07:06] they organized. And again the pure word
[1:07:08] was lost for organization tends towards
[1:07:10] dogma and creeds and not the simple
[1:07:12] word. They could no longer speak for
[1:07:15] God. Then God sent Wesley. He was the
[1:07:17] voice with the word in his day. The
[1:07:18] people who took his revelation from God
[1:07:20] became living epistles read and known of
[1:07:23] all men for their generation. Then the
[1:07:25] Methodists failed. God raised up others.
[1:07:27] And so it has gone on through the years
[1:07:30] until in this last day there's again a
[1:07:31] people in the land who under their
[1:07:33] messenger will will be the final voice
[1:07:35] to the final age. Yes. So the church is
[1:07:38] no longer the mouthpiece of God. It is
[1:07:40] it is its own mouthpiece. So God is
[1:07:43] turning on her. He will confound her
[1:07:45] through the prophet and the bride. For
[1:07:47] the voice of God will be in her. Yes it
[1:07:50] is. Amen. For it says in the last
[1:07:52] chapter of Revelation 17th verse the
[1:07:54] spirit and the bride say come once more.
[1:07:57] more the world will hear direct from God
[1:07:59] is at Pentecost. But of course, the word
[1:08:01] bride will be repudiated as in the first
[1:08:03] age. Amen. So he's saying that the word
[1:08:06] of God, the voice of God is already in
[1:08:08] her. We're not waiting for something
[1:08:10] else to come. We don't need some big
[1:08:12] fandangle preacher to come and reveal
[1:08:14] this to us. It's already been released
[1:08:16] into this age. Amen. It's already been
[1:08:18] given through the message of the hour.
[1:08:19] And the voice of God is in us. That's
[1:08:22] why the fiery trials come because God
[1:08:25] wants to use you as a mouthpiece. I'm
[1:08:28] not a preacher. I'm not even talking
[1:08:29] about preaching necessarily. Talking
[1:08:30] about a lived voice. I mean, a lived
[1:08:33] life where the where where where the
[1:08:34] Bible is put on flesh. Amen. And what
[1:08:37] you speak and do, your actions, all
[1:08:39] those things is actually the Bible
[1:08:41] living.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's what he wants.
[1:08:44] Amen. Now, fiery trials.
[1:08:48] Well, now the reason that that that we
[1:08:51] can stand fiery trials is because the
[1:08:52] word is in us. By the baptism of the
[1:08:55] Holy Ghost, you become part of the
[1:08:57] Bible. That's a quote. Okay? Heaven and
[1:09:00] earth shall pass away, but my word shall
[1:09:02] not pass away. So, it doesn't matter
[1:09:04] what seasons come, what happens, comes,
[1:09:06] there's something in you that endures,
[1:09:08] that is eternal, that is fixed. Right?
[1:09:11] Remember, there's once upon a time you
[1:09:13] just floated with the stream. What's
[1:09:15] hashtag trending today? I'm doing that.
[1:09:18] I'm dressing this way. I'm acting this
[1:09:19] way. But then something happened.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; What happened to you? You were just a
[1:09:23] bunch of driftwood floating. But then
[1:09:25] God got a hold of your wood. Amen.
[1:09:27] Crafted you into a boat and but didn't
[1:09:29] just leave you floating with the tide
[1:09:31] without an engine. He put an engine in
[1:09:32] you. Amen. The dynamics of the Holy
[1:09:34] Ghost and you can go upstream. Doesn't
[1:09:37] matter how strong the current is.
[1:09:38] There's a power within you. It's an
[1:09:40] inexhaustible supply. It won't run out
[1:09:42] of fuel. No. This thing fuels itself.
[1:09:44] Amen. Hallelujah. And what gives you
[1:09:46] power to go beyond or go over the
[1:09:49] current. Doesn't matter what obstacle
[1:09:50] comes your way. Your bow is is is
[1:09:53] manufactured built in such a way you'll
[1:09:56] break through every obstacle.
[1:09:58] Nothing can sink you.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Oh you the devil tries to put fear on.
[1:10:02] Oh, you're going to go too far and
[1:10:03] you're going to fail. I can't fail cuz
[1:10:06] God's in me. The unfailing one.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; I may humanly fall and make mistakes,
[1:10:11] all those things, but there's something
[1:10:13] made within us that we just get back up.
[1:10:15] You may be get that sucker punch. You
[1:10:17] may get blindsided, just get flawed on
[1:10:19] the mat, but something in you says, "I'm
[1:10:20] not staying down for the count. I can't
[1:10:22] I can't physically stay one with the
[1:10:24] mat. I've got to get up." I don't know
[1:10:26] about others, but that's just me. I I
[1:10:28] refuse to just stay there and wait for
[1:10:29] the referee to count to 10 or whatever.
[1:10:31] I'm getting back up. You know, is that
[1:10:33] all you got? Yeah, I'm here all day, you
[1:10:35] know. I'm not quitting. Amen. Why? But
[1:10:38] why? Because the word of God comes into
[1:10:39] your life and it cannot change. It
[1:10:41] cannot pass away. Now this word fiery
[1:10:44] trial it actually means a burning. It's
[1:10:46] the same word in revelations 18 the two
[1:10:49] verses there speak about the destruction
[1:10:51] of uh you know mystery Babylon all these
[1:10:53] things. So so it is a fire. It's a
[1:10:55] burning fire. Amen. But this fire is not
[1:10:57] to destroy you. It's actually to prove
[1:11:00] you to actually produ actually produce
[1:11:02] what's in your life. Now many times we
[1:11:04] think of when trials come we think well
[1:11:06] we've done something wrong. It's
[1:11:07] actually the opposite. You found grace
[1:11:09] in the sight of God.
[1:11:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You found favor just
[1:11:16] like Mary was highly favored with God.
[1:11:18] Amen. Well, you found great favor with
[1:11:20] God, too. That's why trials come. That's
[1:11:22] why tests come. It's not because God is
[1:11:24] dealing with you in such a way like I'm
[1:11:25] just going to grind him to powder. No,
[1:11:27] sir. It's because you found favor with
[1:11:30] God. Praise the Lord. That's what he
[1:11:32] says here. Now, remember, God has
[1:11:33] counted you worthy when you have a test.
[1:11:36] Many times we struggle. Am I worthy
[1:11:38] enough? Am I accepted? Well, if you're
[1:11:40] in the beloved, you're accepted.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have accepted his token,
[1:11:45] his pardon. Amen. His his great grace
[1:11:48] and favor. Well, you have you have been
[1:11:50] counted worthy. Not by your worthiness,
[1:11:53] but by his worthiness.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So, when you're
[1:11:57] counted worthy, well, well, how do I
[1:11:58] know? Well, you have a test. And that
[1:12:01] test is not a final exam to see if you
[1:12:03] pass or not. That's just to prove now
[1:12:06] what that you're worthy. that the word
[1:12:08] of God is within you.
[1:12:11] Amen. When you have a trial or a test,
[1:12:13] it shows the grace of God has found you.
[1:12:15] I think we could just chew on this for a
[1:12:17] while. Put this on your refrigerator.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, how do I know you? Because well, are
[1:12:21] we really under grace? Well, when you go
[1:12:24] over trial or a test, it shows it. I'm
[1:12:27] not trying to be I just Let's just be
[1:12:29] happy this morning.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Let's turn this on its head, right?
[1:12:33] Because often we think, "Oh, we've done
[1:12:35] this wrong and this wrong and no." Well,
[1:12:38] no,
[1:12:39] that does not mean you've stepped out of
[1:12:40] the grace of God. That means you're in
[1:12:42] the grace of God.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; You have found favor with God. And God
[1:12:46] believes you'll stand the test.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; What part of you is he really trusting
[1:12:50] in? Your humanity, your character, your
[1:12:53] upbringing, how smart you are, your
[1:12:56] human resolve. None of those things.
[1:12:58] He's counting in that seed of election
[1:13:00] that's in your soul.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; That's what he's counting. can remember
[1:13:03] he did the same thing by Job. Job went
[1:13:06] through a fiery trial and all that was
[1:13:08] that fire was lit under him that he
[1:13:11] could stand and say now I know my
[1:13:13] redeemer lives.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say all of that for
[1:13:17] that. Absolutely. Can you imagine a guy
[1:13:19] he's he's sacrificing he's giving a lamb
[1:13:22] God instituted lamb out of fear for his
[1:13:25] family. He's worshiping out of fear.
[1:13:27] Least even they think of something evil
[1:13:29] against God. You got read the scripture.
[1:13:31] He was actually he he was a believer out
[1:13:33] of fear. He had faith. He was a believer
[1:13:35] but he was afraid. What's going to
[1:13:37] happen to my family? Didn't know what
[1:13:38] happened on the other side. And you know
[1:13:40] you know he saw resurrection and botney
[1:13:42] life and all these things. But when a
[1:13:43] man dies what happens? Where does he go?
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; So God God basically said I'm going to
[1:13:49] allow the enemy to do some things to him
[1:13:52] because I don't want him lukewarm just
[1:13:53] just guessing wondering. I want to put a
[1:13:56] fire in his life that he knows and whom
[1:13:58] he has believed. Amen. Are you all with
[1:14:00] me this morning? And and that's why he
[1:14:03] about to stand though these skin worm
[1:14:04] worms destroy this flesh. My skin worms
[1:14:07] that are in me already destroy this
[1:14:08] flesh, yet in my flesh I'll see God.
[1:14:11] I'll stand with him on the latter days
[1:14:12] on the earth. With my eyes, I will
[1:14:14] behold him. I'll come forth as gold.
[1:14:17] Amen. Though he slay me, yet I'll trust
[1:14:19] him. See, that's someone who's on fire.
[1:14:21] See, because the whole Christian
[1:14:22] experience is really to do you trust
[1:14:25] God?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; The Christian walk is based on trust,
[1:14:28] faith, and trust. And if you love him,
[1:14:30] you'll really trust him.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Do you trust me? This is the whole thing
[1:14:34] because this is why people go, they make
[1:14:36] denominations. They go find other
[1:14:38] leadership or guidance apart from the
[1:14:40] word of God because they don't trust the
[1:14:42] word of God. See, if they really trusted
[1:14:43] the word, you don't look for anything
[1:14:45] else. You're satisfied. Lord, you're my
[1:14:47] shepherd. You're guiding me. You're
[1:14:48] keeping me. Nothing can get me without
[1:14:51] stepping over you first. Therefore, it's
[1:14:53] got to get your permission. And I know
[1:14:54] everything that comes against me is for
[1:14:56] my good. Why? to put a fire in my life
[1:14:58] that you can speak through me, Lord.
[1:15:00] That I'm not just standing here just
[1:15:01] just a, you know, what do you call it?
[1:15:04] Just being battered for nothing. No, God
[1:15:07] allows those things because God wants to
[1:15:10] express himself. Speak. Amen. [snorts]
[1:15:12] And that's what he did in Job's life.
[1:15:15] Praise the Lord. So, storms are good.
[1:15:17] Trials are good. Fiery trial. You got to
[1:15:19] Every trial you go through, you say,
[1:15:20] "I'm going through a fiery trial."
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It may be a big trial, may
[1:15:24] be a small trial. It's a fiery trial.
[1:15:26] Amen. God's lighting a fire in my life
[1:15:28] cuz he wants to use these lips. He wants
[1:15:30] to use this to to live. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:33] That's what they're saying today. Here
[1:15:35] is uh here this here. Holy Ghost
[1:15:37] religion you're talking about. Won't be
[1:15:39] long that that tree will burn down. It
[1:15:42] don't burn down. Amen. It Oh, the fire
[1:15:46] only waters it. I like that. I like that
[1:15:48] phrase. The fire only waters it. This
[1:15:51] fiery trial you're going through, it's
[1:15:52] just watering me. It's just helping me
[1:15:54] to drink more of God and push out Amen.
[1:15:56] Push out to peace. Push out to joy.
[1:15:59] Amen. Push out to love.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, every every single apple
[1:16:06] um seed or tree or fruit that ever was
[1:16:09] was in the very first one that God made,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; right? All that tree had to do that seed
[1:16:14] was planted and then it had to drink and
[1:16:16] it drank more than it needed and it
[1:16:18] pushed out a limb. Pushed out another
[1:16:20] limb. Pushed out fruit. Pushed out and
[1:16:23] then and then what that fruit went? It
[1:16:25] went somewhere else and it grew another
[1:16:26] tree. But the first one just drank and
[1:16:29] pushed out to produce the fruit of the
[1:16:32] life that's already within it. Same
[1:16:33] thing with you and I friends. There's a
[1:16:35] life within us that will produce the
[1:16:37] fruit of love and joy and peace and
[1:16:40] being longsuffering, gentleness,
[1:16:41] meekness, fa patience, all those all all
[1:16:44] the fruits of the spirit. All you got to
[1:16:45] do is drink. That's why the fire only
[1:16:48] waters it.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. It only gives us
[1:16:52] new hope. Well, how can a trial give you
[1:16:55] hope? Well, before I stepped into this
[1:16:57] thing, God was already there because he
[1:16:58] leads me. He's doing it for a purpose.
[1:17:02] He wants to put a fire. Who's under a
[1:17:04] fire right now? Or who's above a fire?
[1:17:07] It's cooking you. It's heating you up.
[1:17:10] God wants you hot. He doesn't want you
[1:17:12] lukewarm. That's why he allows these
[1:17:13] things. Remember, all things work
[1:17:15] together for our good.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; It's the devil that makes us think it's
[1:17:19] not for our good.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; This is working. God is working mightily
[1:17:23] in me.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It only gives us new
[1:17:27] hope. It only strengthens it. Every
[1:17:29] trial testing, every time a wind hits a
[1:17:31] tree, shoves it back and forth and and
[1:17:33] back and forth, it only loosens the root
[1:17:35] so it can grow deeper and get a better
[1:17:37] hold. Amen. Every time sickness strikes
[1:17:40] your home, every time a trial strikes
[1:17:42] your home, every time the neighbors say
[1:17:44] something bad about you, it's only
[1:17:45] shaking you, loosen you up so you can
[1:17:48] get down and get a better hold on the
[1:17:49] eternal rock of God's immovable word.
[1:17:52] That's how God does it. Amen. He sends
[1:17:54] those trials to test you, to prove you,
[1:17:56] to shake you, and to give you a new
[1:17:59] hold. Amen. That's why because you're,
[1:18:01] you know, God allows situations to come
[1:18:03] in life because he wants us to worship
[1:18:06] him by revelation, not by a nice idea.
[1:18:09] You see, before you're ever sick, it's a
[1:18:11] nice idea that he's a healer, right? But
[1:18:13] then what happens? He brings sickness
[1:18:15] and he shakes you. Then you can get a
[1:18:16] hold of that word. Amen. That that that
[1:18:19] he becomes the healer in your life. Then
[1:18:20] you can because it's a revelation to
[1:18:22] you. He's my healer. Then you can
[1:18:24] worship him. Lord, you're my healer.
[1:18:26] Beforehand, it was just a nice idea. But
[1:18:28] God shakes you till you get a hold of
[1:18:30] that word. Amen. Whenever you even even
[1:18:32] even even when you're lost, you know, I
[1:18:35] remember before the Lord found me,
[1:18:36] people would say, "God is love and God
[1:18:38] loves you." I thought, "What an airy
[1:18:39] fairy mumbo jumbo." I'm just being
[1:18:42] honest. Makes no sense. It's just vague.
[1:18:44] But then when he got a hold of my life,
[1:18:45] filled my heart with his love. What
[1:18:47] happened? He was shaking me with
[1:18:49] stirring up my nest, getting a hold of
[1:18:51] my life. Amen. It caused me to get a
[1:18:53] hold of that word. God is love. God
[1:18:56] loves you. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad
[1:18:59] for that. Amen. So, so everything you go
[1:19:01] through, you know, you're going through,
[1:19:02] you know, you're troubled, but he's your
[1:19:05] counselor.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; What's happened? That the wind is blown
[1:19:09] cuz God wants you, your roots to go
[1:19:10] down. I'm going to use this over and
[1:19:12] over. You're going to realize
[1:19:13] everything's working for your good.
[1:19:15] You're troubled. You need counsel and
[1:19:17] you you you know, you're being shaken.
[1:19:18] What's happen? Your roots are growing
[1:19:19] down because there's a rock. There's
[1:19:20] part of the rock. I'm the counselor. I'm
[1:19:22] the mighty God. And then you open the
[1:19:24] word. You hear the message. You hear a
[1:19:26] song and something just drops in. There
[1:19:27] it is.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who's that? Who's had that
[1:19:30] experience?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; What's happened? It just causes you to
[1:19:34] get a new hold.
[1:19:36] We could go on and on. You feel
[1:19:38] troubled. You get shaken. Your roots
[1:19:41] grow down. He is my peace. He's my joy.
[1:19:44] He's my satisfying portion. He's my
[1:19:47] guide. He's my shield. See, all those
[1:19:49] things require some wind.
[1:19:51] Praise the Lord. Amen. And if you got a
[1:19:55] lot of leaves, you're going to catch a
[1:19:56] lot of wind.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; We ain't some dead stick somewhere.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, we ain't living as some like
[1:20:02] dead, you know, middle of winter
[1:20:04] somewhere, all the leaves are gone off
[1:20:05] the tree. No, we're being restored to a
[1:20:07] full bloom. The restoration of the bride
[1:20:09] tree has taken place. Amen. So, we can
[1:20:12] catch a lot of wind. Got a lot of
[1:20:14] leaves.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That means that every
[1:20:17] trial will shake us the more than a dead
[1:20:19] stick. And when the wind blows through
[1:20:21] us, it doesn't give out some mournful
[1:20:23] sound. This ain't fair. Why me? Woe is
[1:20:25] me. Poor me. Some pity party sound. No,
[1:20:28] it's praise the Lord.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz we got green leaves. Amen. On
[1:20:32] our tree blowing. Amen. Giving praise to
[1:20:35] God.
[1:20:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:38] Amen.
[1:20:40] Amen. Lazarus got sick. Theologians uh
[1:20:43] believe he died with hemorrhage of the
[1:20:44] lungs. That I don't know. The Bible
[1:20:46] doesn't say nothing. Some of the writers
[1:20:48] said it was all right. He got sick. And
[1:20:50] sometimes God tries your faith. Do you
[1:20:52] believe that? Every son that cometh to
[1:20:53] God must be tried. Think it not strange
[1:20:55] that fiery trials come because it's only
[1:20:58] done to perfect your faith. Draws you
[1:21:01] closer. They're worth more than gold to
[1:21:04] you.
[1:21:06] It perfects your faith. How does it
[1:21:07] perfect your faith? It takes your human
[1:21:09] reasoning to one side because it brings
[1:21:12] you to a place that you're reasoning
[1:21:14] what you think you know comes to its
[1:21:15] end. Amen. It's like um I think I've got
[1:21:18] the picture here.
[1:21:21] I think Jimmy had the same one. This is
[1:21:22] by Rembrandt, a famous painting of Jesus
[1:21:24] being asleep in the boat, right? Those
[1:21:28] disciples
[1:21:29] were raised on that sea. I know I've
[1:21:32] said this before, but hey, maybe I'm
[1:21:33] just getting old. I repeat myself. Okay,
[1:21:36] they they were old, right? They had
[1:21:39] raised there. They weren't old.
[1:21:40] Whatever. I'm jetlagged. Okay, they were
[1:21:44] raised on that sea. They knew the
[1:21:45] weather patterns. They knew the storms.
[1:21:47] They probably built the ship that they
[1:21:49] were sailing in. They knew how it
[1:21:50] handled. Okay? When you get when you get
[1:21:53] so um accustomed to something, you know
[1:21:55] exactly how it handles. A car, a boat,
[1:21:57] whatever it is, you know how it handles
[1:21:59] different conditions. But you see what
[1:22:01] happened is that storm came to perfect
[1:22:03] their faith. Cuz when they left to cross
[1:22:06] that sea, their faith was in their
[1:22:08] ability,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; right? But they had to get a hold on the
[1:22:12] fact that there was someone greater in
[1:22:15] the ship than them. And so God stirred
[1:22:17] them up because God didn't want them
[1:22:19] lukewarm indifference saying, "I can
[1:22:21] handle this." See, this is a big part of
[1:22:23] lukewarmness. It's not See, cold is
[1:22:26] complete indifference. Lukewarmness is a
[1:22:28] little bit warm, a little bit cold. So
[1:22:29] what has that got? I can kind of handle
[1:22:31] this. I know what I'm doing. Listen, you
[1:22:33] know, there's a saying, this is not my
[1:22:35] first rodeo. I've been through this
[1:22:36] before.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; And what is that? That's when human
[1:22:39] reasoning is actually controlled. But
[1:22:40] you see, the Lord Jesus did not want his
[1:22:44] disciples to be lukewarm or cold. He
[1:22:46] wanted them to be hot that deity could
[1:22:48] speak. They had deity in the ship with
[1:22:51] them. He had had a big meeting. He knew
[1:22:53] what was going to happen when they got
[1:22:54] on this got on the sea and he just fell
[1:22:56] asleep. Because the devil looks down and
[1:23:00] he says, "Look, we got him now, boys.
[1:23:02] He's exhausted. He's asleep on the boat.
[1:23:04] We're going to drown him." And brother
[1:23:05] Bram said, "10,000 demons go in the wind
[1:23:07] and waves saw thy drown him." And but
[1:23:10] but the reason this trial went so long
[1:23:13] is because it took that long for the
[1:23:15] disciples to get to their end, right? It
[1:23:17] took them that long because you were
[1:23:19] think about this. They they weren't fair
[1:23:22] with the sailors. They knew what they
[1:23:24] were doing. Okay? So the more you know
[1:23:26] what you're doing humanly, the longer
[1:23:28] you'll go humanly doing what you think
[1:23:29] you know what you're doing,
[1:23:32] right? But then it comes to a point, but
[1:23:34] imagine if they were just green, they
[1:23:36] just maybe, you know, they they knew
[1:23:38] nothing of sailing. They would have
[1:23:39] woken the master way earlier than they
[1:23:41] did. But because they were old salts,
[1:23:43] you know, they thought we can handle it.
[1:23:44] We can trim the trim the sails. We can
[1:23:46] drive the boat into the swells
[1:23:48] differently so we don't take on so much
[1:23:49] water. We can adjust all the all the
[1:23:51] weights and all those things. We can we
[1:23:53] know what we're doing. It took them a
[1:23:55] while to realize their reasoning was
[1:23:58] just lukewarm ideas. Amen. But they had
[1:24:00] to awaken the master. And they got to a
[1:24:03] point where they thought that the Lord
[1:24:04] Jesus was indifferent in their trial. He
[1:24:07] wasn't indifferent. He was waiting for
[1:24:09] them to wake him up. Amen. Because we're
[1:24:11] all free moral agents.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; God never intervenes in a way that's
[1:24:15] against your will. You have to willingly
[1:24:17] call them on the scene. Amen. So, so,
[1:24:19] but Jesus was in their ship. That's the
[1:24:22] main thing. And I trust Jesus is in your
[1:24:24] ship this morning. Amen. He's in your
[1:24:26] vessel. But you've got to but but he
[1:24:28] allowed that trial for them not to be
[1:24:30] lukewarm, not to be cold, but to be on
[1:24:32] fire that deity could raise up and speak
[1:24:34] and take preminence over the whole
[1:24:36] situation.
[1:24:37] Amen. I trust that's how you do things
[1:24:39] in life. Oh, I've got the I know what
[1:24:42] I'm doing. I know how to adult. I've
[1:24:43] done it for a while. We don't know
[1:24:45] nothing, man.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Let's be honest. We know nothing.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; God knows everything. And the sooner you
[1:24:50] call him on the scene,
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; the better the storm can be taken care
[1:24:54] of. But the longer you try and hold
[1:24:56] things together because you know what
[1:24:58] you're doing, you're just going to get a
[1:25:00] lot more water in the boat.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; And then the devil will put in your mind
[1:25:05] that Jesus doesn't care. He does care.
[1:25:06] You've got to wake him up. You've got to
[1:25:08] allow him to take over. Amen. That's the
[1:25:11] problem is man will always say, "No, I
[1:25:13] know what I'm doing." And they'll use
[1:25:14] scripture to clarify or to validate
[1:25:17] their stand. Why don't we just let the
[1:25:19] Lord Jesus have preeminence? Why don't
[1:25:20] we let him speak? Why don't we let him
[1:25:23] take control?
[1:25:25] Oh, but you don't know what I'm going
[1:25:26] through. Let's just throw that to the
[1:25:28] side, okay? There's nothing God can't
[1:25:31] handle.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; If he can handle hell, death, in the
[1:25:33] grave, I think he can handle your case.
[1:25:36] If he can take your sin, everyone else's
[1:25:38] sin to Calvary as a man, I think he can
[1:25:40] deal with what you're going through,
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; right? I think Yeah, I think he's the
[1:25:43] professional in the matter, right? So,
[1:25:46] praise the Lord. Now, so all those
[1:25:48] things, but what did that do? That
[1:25:51] perfected their faith. Messiah could do
[1:25:53] everything. They were they were even
[1:25:54] shocked and surprised by what he did.
[1:25:56] What manner of man is this? What's
[1:25:59] really within our boat? And I trust that
[1:26:02] we've had enough experiences with the
[1:26:03] Lord that we could say, "Really, who's
[1:26:05] in me?" More than a religious spirit,
[1:26:08] more than a church, more than a group,
[1:26:10] more than a following, but deity is in
[1:26:12] man.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:16] Amen. Trials are here to feed us. Yeah,
[1:26:20] we pray. Give us this day our daily
[1:26:21] bread.
[1:26:23] And that's the word of God. But Caleb
[1:26:26] and Joshua would stand there with the 10
[1:26:27] other spies and he would uh they would
[1:26:30] tell those 10 spies who brought an evil
[1:26:32] report to the land. Actually, you're
[1:26:34] looking at this the wrong way.
[1:26:37] These guys you see and you've put such a
[1:26:39] big stature on us being grasshoppers. Um
[1:26:41] they're bread.
[1:26:43] They're bread for us. This fiery trial
[1:26:45] gives you strength. Why do we eat? It
[1:26:48] tastes good, but it gives us strength,
[1:26:51] right? Amen. So he's saying these, you
[1:26:53] know, this giant, this land, the people,
[1:26:55] all these things, they are nothing but
[1:26:57] bread for us. Amen. That God is going to
[1:26:59] give us strength that God can speak, God
[1:27:01] can live, God can prove his word. So
[1:27:04] everything you're going through, it is
[1:27:05] bread.
[1:27:07] Amen. I I'll be happy then if no one
[1:27:09] else will be happy. Okay? This is food.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You say, "Well, this is
[1:27:13] a mountain of bread. This this obstacle
[1:27:15] or this this this trial is so big."
[1:27:17] Well, it's like just like eating an
[1:27:19] elephant. quoting brother and Paul. One
[1:27:22] bite at a time.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Take one bite at a time. You say, "I've
[1:27:25] got a whole host against me." Well, just
[1:27:27] take down one at a time. Amen. If you're
[1:27:29] indifferent, take that one down. Amen.
[1:27:31] You got a complex, you think no one
[1:27:33] likes you, do the opposite. Take that
[1:27:34] one down. Amen. If you feel insecure,
[1:27:37] take the word of God, quote it over your
[1:27:38] life. I'm accepted in the beloved. Amen.
[1:27:41] I'm the apple of his eye. Amen.
[1:27:44] I'm his queen. I'm his all in all. I'm
[1:27:46] his family. He can't lose one of his.
[1:27:49] Amen. I'm his beloved. I'm his delight.
[1:27:51] He delights in me. The scripture says,
[1:27:52] you know, the Lord delights in you. Take
[1:27:54] those things.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Before the foundation of the world, I
[1:27:57] was there. After all things, I'll still
[1:27:59] be there. The devil's getting off at
[1:28:00] some point. He's going to lake of fire,
[1:28:02] but I will still be when he's no longer
[1:28:04] Amen. So, I think we should take those
[1:28:05] things. Amen. What does that do? It
[1:28:08] takes down an enemy. It actually gives
[1:28:10] you strength. Don't wallow in your
[1:28:12] insecurity or what you think about you.
[1:28:14] No. Rejoice in what God has declared
[1:28:16] about you. Because what he says about
[1:28:18] you is not based on opinion. It's not
[1:28:20] based on your facts. It's not based on
[1:28:22] circumstance. It's not based on your age
[1:28:24] or what you're going through. No, what
[1:28:25] he says about you is eternal, perfect,
[1:28:27] and forever.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; And he cannot change his mind about his
[1:28:31] word.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm the I'm the exception to the
[1:28:37] rule. There ain't exceptions in this
[1:28:39] baby.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; That's everyone's the same.
[1:28:43] We got to get that thinking out of our
[1:28:44] minds.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; God loves you.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus loves me. This I know. You just
[1:28:50] have that revelation. It'll change your
[1:28:51] whole life when you realize he really
[1:28:53] loves me. And his love is not based on
[1:28:55] my performance. Not how good I am, smart
[1:28:57] I am, well behaved I am. His love that's
[1:29:01] got nothing to do with his love. It's
[1:29:03] not a human love. It's election. Amen.
[1:29:05] If this word has found you, it proves
[1:29:07] your election. It proves you're part of
[1:29:08] him.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Case closed. Just go dancing. Amen. just
[1:29:12] rejoice. We don't need to be so worried.
[1:29:18] We got to confess and speak what God has
[1:29:20] said about us. But it's bread. Take one
[1:29:22] bite at a time. Kill one devil at a
[1:29:24] time. Amen. But it takes you to do it.
[1:29:28] But the devil wants to lock you into a
[1:29:30] thinking thing. Well, this is just I was
[1:29:32] just born this way. Well, get born
[1:29:33] again.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; I was something you Oh, you know, people
[1:29:38] say that this message is just
[1:29:40] brainwashing. I needed my brain washed.
[1:29:42] I had filthy thoughts. It was horrible.
[1:29:44] I needed this thing needed a good
[1:29:45] soaking. It needed the full dullex wash,
[1:29:48] you know. I needed the whole thing.
[1:29:49] Praise God for being brainwashed. You
[1:29:52] can clip that. I don't care. You know, I
[1:29:55] needed brainwashing.
[1:29:57] [snorts] Every man, woman, and child
[1:29:59] needs brainwashing, by the way. You
[1:30:01] understand what I mean? Eh, need the
[1:30:03] spirit to be cleansed out.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see now the word of God is
[1:30:08] immovable.
[1:30:10] Now, Enoch built the Great Pyramid. It's
[1:30:13] endured a lot of things. It's a Bible in
[1:30:15] stone. It's a monument of God in stone.
[1:30:19] It's been through a lot of things. It
[1:30:21] went through the great flood. It's been
[1:30:23] through famines. It's been through
[1:30:24] civilizations raising and going down. It
[1:30:26] endured Moses going in there, God coming
[1:30:28] and delivering Egypt. It saw It saw the
[1:30:31] whole thing. It's seen droughts, famine,
[1:30:33] disaster, wars, plagues, battles, the
[1:30:36] flood. It's seen all things, but yet it
[1:30:38] still remains. And God has allowed it to
[1:30:41] endure there as a as a monument of stone
[1:30:44] saying my word doesn't matter what
[1:30:46] condition it goes through climate change
[1:30:48] whatever whatever it doesn't matter it
[1:30:50] will endure.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now God doesn't want a monument of
[1:30:55] stone only. He wants living stones.
[1:30:58] Amen. He wants a people that are built
[1:31:00] in the image of his word. Amen. And God
[1:31:02] is going to put us in different
[1:31:04] conditions to prove my word endures.
[1:31:07] Amen. More than a stubborn attitude.
[1:31:09] more than just, oh, I'm going to be a
[1:31:10] Christian. No, it's not that. It's the
[1:31:12] word of God's taken prayer minutes in a
[1:31:14] people and they can go through wars,
[1:31:16] conflict, strife, problems, sickness,
[1:31:18] sorrow, pain, misunderstandings, hurts,
[1:31:20] resentment, whatever it is, and they
[1:31:22] will stand. Amen. Just like that pyramid
[1:31:24] stands. God wants a living witness. He
[1:31:27] wants a timetested church. Amen. That
[1:31:30] doesn't become lukewarm and indifferent
[1:31:32] because of things that happen to them.
[1:31:33] No, they stay on fire.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm looking at you, by
[1:31:37] the way. I'm talking about you today,
[1:31:38] man. He's just preaching about me all
[1:31:40] day. I pray I am preaching about you
[1:31:41] today. Amen. Say, "Yes, I am that way.
[1:31:44] God has put a fire on in my life." Amen.
[1:31:46] That I'm not lukewarm and different,
[1:31:48] cold, but there's a fire that God can
[1:31:49] speak.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus Christ came from heaven,
[1:31:55] uh, the glory from glory down here to
[1:31:57] build a church. And the material that
[1:31:59] he's putting in it is a time-tested
[1:32:01] material. You might come to the altar
[1:32:03] make a confession and when he finds blow
[1:32:05] holes everything else see the world is
[1:32:07] blowing the maggots in you and so forth
[1:32:08] you cannot stand. He just pitches you to
[1:32:10] one side. God wants a time pardon me a
[1:32:12] time tested church. Not somebody who's a
[1:32:15] Christian today a backslider tomorrow in
[1:32:16] and out up and down. He can't place you
[1:32:18] nowhere. But he's got a church that's
[1:32:21] tested. Went through trials through
[1:32:23] losses through sickness through sorrow
[1:32:26] through death and still stand with a
[1:32:29] testimony.
[1:32:31] just comes to mind the brother that
[1:32:33] wrote the song it is well with my soul
[1:32:36] lost everything
[1:32:38] what was the response he wasn't lukewarm
[1:32:40] he was on fire so what was the response
[1:32:42] of God that came out of his lips that
[1:32:45] that song
[1:32:47] he went through everything
[1:32:51] I trust we could stand with the same
[1:32:54] resolve and and I don't think he was
[1:32:56] planning what he said it just came out
[1:32:58] it is well with my soul when peace like
[1:33:00] a Whoever attendeth my way, when sorrow
[1:33:02] is like sea below's roll, whatever my
[1:33:04] lot, thou has taught me to know it is
[1:33:06] well with my soul. Amen. Praise the
[1:33:10] Lord. Yes. Uh that's the man. Yes.
[1:33:12] That's the man he's looking for. I don't
[1:33:13] care if uh if you're a porper, I don't
[1:33:15] care if you're a beggar. I don't care if
[1:33:16] you're a rag picker. Whatever you are,
[1:33:18] God puts the test to you. Amen. To show
[1:33:21] that you are a timetested memorial. Now,
[1:33:24] I see that time is time is fleeing. Um,
[1:33:28] but you see, a time-t tested church, a
[1:33:31] one that goes through many things is a
[1:33:34] one that recognizes the enemy in every
[1:33:36] one of his tricks. [snorts] Amen. He
[1:33:38] realizes the devil's not a thought, but
[1:33:40] he's a real being. Right? We ain't
[1:33:43] ostriches around here that bear our
[1:33:45] heads. We don't have ostrich faith. We
[1:33:47] got eagle faith. And eagle faith that
[1:33:49] lifts us up into the heavenlies to see
[1:33:51] where we're going, where we came from.
[1:33:52] that this thing is just a little thing
[1:33:54] in time to make us fiery hot to speak.
[1:33:58] Right? So you must know he's a devil.
[1:34:01] Absolutely. At the same time you
[1:34:02] recognize him and know he's a devil and
[1:34:05] he's against you. Then to overcome, you
[1:34:06] must recognize that the God in you is
[1:34:09] greater and mightier than he is. That
[1:34:11] that the one that's in you has already
[1:34:12] overcome him and by his grace you're
[1:34:14] more than a match for him. Amen. There's
[1:34:16] a real overcoming when you recognize you
[1:34:18] look back say I'm doing this. I'm doing
[1:34:19] that. No. Then you're defeated. But
[1:34:22] there's no condemnation to them which
[1:34:23] are in Christ Jesus that walk not after
[1:34:25] the flesh but after the spirit. Then you
[1:34:27] realize you've overcome. And you know
[1:34:29] that he's a devil. You don't say, "I've
[1:34:30] got a sickness and I don't believe it's
[1:34:31] a sickness." Oh yes, it's a sickness.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; I like to know the name of the enemy.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; It's like David asks about Goliath.
[1:34:39] Who's this guy? Who's this uncircumcised
[1:34:41] Philistine? I don't want him to be some
[1:34:43] nameless enemy. I want to know his name.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Then I can take his head off.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; I like to know him. Don't you? That's
[1:34:50] part of going to the doctor. I believe,
[1:34:52] you know, you know, there's times where
[1:34:53] the doctor's um what do you call it? The
[1:34:55] um GP contacts me saying, "Do you want
[1:34:57] to still be on our books? You haven't
[1:34:58] visited in like 5 years." You know, but
[1:35:01] when I need to, I go to a doctor. I
[1:35:02] believe that. I believe it's God, you
[1:35:04] know, it's part of God's way of healing.
[1:35:05] I'm not against it. Okay. But I like to
[1:35:08] know what I'm facing as well.
[1:35:11] All right.
[1:35:14] Okay. But remember, greater is he. See,
[1:35:16] yeah. Um yes, it's a sickness. You got
[1:35:18] you got cancer. You don't believe it's a
[1:35:20] cancer. It's a cancer. It's a cancer.
[1:35:21] But remember, greater is he that's in
[1:35:23] you than he that's in the world. You
[1:35:24] must realize the Holy Spirit that's in
[1:35:26] you has already overcome this thing and
[1:35:28] he's in you and you can overcome by him.
[1:35:30] That's exactly sensible. It's exactly
[1:35:32] the way the scriptures written
[1:35:33] overcoming.
[1:35:35] Amen. Because what does that enemy do?
[1:35:36] What does that thing do? It makes you
[1:35:38] hot to speak. It's a fiery trial.
[1:35:43] Daniel and his friends weren't lukewarm.
[1:35:47] When they left Jerusalem as young
[1:35:49] people, they made up their mind. We are
[1:35:51] the sons of Abraham. So therefore,
[1:35:53] wherever we go, we're going to be sons
[1:35:55] of Abraham. Jehovah is our God. We're
[1:35:57] serving him wherever we go. No church,
[1:35:59] no nothing. That's irrelevant. I'm a
[1:36:01] believer wherever they go. Now when when
[1:36:04] the king had the dream and they would
[1:36:06] they would you know he couldn't even
[1:36:07] remember the dream and his uh wise men
[1:36:10] couldn't bring the dream to his mind or
[1:36:12] they didn't know what he dreamt he
[1:36:13] wanted to kill them all. What did that
[1:36:14] do? This is a fiery trial, right? This
[1:36:16] has got a time thing on it that if they
[1:36:18] don't if they don't come up with an
[1:36:20] answer, they're going to die with all
[1:36:21] the rest of them. But what did that make
[1:36:22] them do? It didn't make them lukewarm
[1:36:24] and different saying, "God, this is not
[1:36:26] fair. You see the stand I've taken since
[1:36:27] I've left left Jerusalem and you've
[1:36:29] allowed this to come." No, it didn't do
[1:36:31] that to them. It made them hot. It gave
[1:36:34] them, it was a fiery trial for them
[1:36:36] because it made them more sincere. It
[1:36:38] brought them closer to the Lord that
[1:36:39] what happened that God could speak
[1:36:41] through Daniel and give the
[1:36:42] interpretation.
[1:36:43] I trust we do the same thing when trials
[1:36:46] come our way. It draws us closer that
[1:36:48] God could speak.
[1:36:50] Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same thing the same thing when
[1:36:54] when when Daniel's three friends were
[1:36:56] thrown into the thrown into the furnace.
[1:36:59] To me, as I've said before, the great
[1:37:01] the great thing about this story is the
[1:37:04] fact they said, "We don't know what's
[1:37:06] going to happen to us, oh king, but
[1:37:07] we're not going to bow because we're not
[1:37:09] lukewarm. We're not just trying to
[1:37:10] survive and try and keep our head below
[1:37:13] the parapit." That's that's exactly the
[1:37:16] word I was looking for. You know, try
[1:37:17] and hide from things. No, we're
[1:37:19] believers. I'm gonna believe be a
[1:37:21] believer. It's who I am, right? I don't
[1:37:24] identify as one. I am one. Okay? So they
[1:37:27] just just decided, well, king, our God
[1:37:30] can save us, but if not, we're not
[1:37:31] bowing.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; They it didn't make them lukewarm. It
[1:37:35] now this is a literally a fiery trial.
[1:37:37] It's a furnace in front of them, but
[1:37:38] they had already made up their mind.
[1:37:40] Whatever happens, we will not compromise
[1:37:42] on the word of God.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happened? They got thrown
[1:37:46] in the furnace and the and the cords and
[1:37:48] things that they, you know, that they
[1:37:49] were bound by, they were loose when they
[1:37:51] came out. They didn't even have a smell
[1:37:53] of smoke on them. But the main thing is
[1:37:56] when they're in the furnace, he won. He
[1:37:58] they were loose. But why were they
[1:37:59] loosed? Because God himself came into
[1:38:01] their trial. God himself stepped into
[1:38:03] the fiery trial because they're on fire.
[1:38:05] Then God could speak. And brother Ram
[1:38:07] said that they were fellowshipping with
[1:38:08] the Lord in that furnace about what they
[1:38:12] would uh experience in the future.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; That's what God does. You're in a trial,
[1:38:17] right? But then something anchors in
[1:38:18] your heart. This is not my end.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going through this. God's going to
[1:38:22] see me through. I'm his child. When this
[1:38:25] life ends, I'm going to glory. Nothing
[1:38:28] can touch my soul. I'm safe and secure.
[1:38:31] Doesn't matter if my mind goes, my body
[1:38:33] goes, that's irrelevant. It is well with
[1:38:36] my soul. And that is the real you. Amen.
[1:38:39] It's not your body. It's not your
[1:38:40] spirit. It's not your mind or anything.
[1:38:42] It's your soul that's the real you. And
[1:38:44] then so it doesn't matter what happens
[1:38:45] to this body.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; I'm safe.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:53] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; You know, the book of Psalms we so
[1:38:57] enjoy, most of it was not written when
[1:39:00] [clears throat] David was sitting in a
[1:39:02] king's palace.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; It was written when he was on the run
[1:39:05] from Saul. So, the fiery trial of him
[1:39:09] running from Saul and actually knowing
[1:39:12] that God would remove Saul in his time.
[1:39:14] Remember, he had two opportunities to
[1:39:15] kill to kill Saul, right? But he said,
[1:39:18] "No, God God will move him in the time."
[1:39:20] David knew he was king of Israel, right?
[1:39:23] He wasn't trying to be king. He knew he
[1:39:24] was king, right? But what happened is
[1:39:26] that fiery trial came into David's life
[1:39:28] that the book of Psalms could be written
[1:39:31] that that God could speak. Right? The
[1:39:34] Psalms is not David just writing things.
[1:39:37] It was God anointing him, but it was a
[1:39:39] fiery trial of being on the run in
[1:39:41] distress, worried, running with his men,
[1:39:44] feeling the burden of looking after
[1:39:45] them, being a fugitive in his own land.
[1:39:47] All that pressure, what the pressure do?
[1:39:49] What that fire do? May God speak
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; to be like David.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; We're built with the same material.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; You know, David could not fully express
[1:40:00] himself like we can because he did not
[1:40:04] have God dwelling in him like we do.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; That's why he would say, "As a heart
[1:40:10] panth for the waterbrook, so my soul
[1:40:11] longs after you." He had such a longing
[1:40:13] and we know that's our longing too. But
[1:40:15] he could not satisfy that longing under
[1:40:18] the blood of bulls and goats,
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; but under the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine him in this day?
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I had this longing my
[1:40:27] whole life. [laughter]
[1:40:28] I couldn't EVEN MEET THE LONGING. I
[1:40:31] COULDN'T EVEN SATISFY THIS thirst under
[1:40:34] the blood of BULLS AND GOATS. YET GOD
[1:40:36] WAS WITH ME. YET GOD SPOKE TO ME. YET
[1:40:38] GOD LIVED ME. BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN
[1:40:39] my soul that COULD NOT BE QUENCHED. BUT
[1:40:41] YOU, FRIENDS, UNDER THE BLOOD OF JESUS
[1:40:43] CHRIST. AMEN. YOU CAN HAVE THAT LONGING
[1:40:45] SATISFIED AND NOT JUST SATIS LIKE
[1:40:47] SATISFIED LIKE YOU DON'T WANT ANYMORE
[1:40:48] BUT IT JUST GIVES YOU MORE AND MORE AND
[1:40:50] MORE AND YOU CAN WORSHIP IN A WAY DAVID
[1:40:52] COULD NEVER WORSHIP. YOU CAN WALK WITH
[1:40:54] GOD THE WAY GOD DAVID DAVID NEVER COULD.
[1:40:56] WHY? CUZ GOD IS CHRIST IS IN YOU THE
[1:40:58] HOPE OF GLORY NOT JUST WITH YOU NOT JUST
[1:41:00] ANOINTING YOU BUT ABIDING IN YOUR SOUL.
[1:41:02] HALLELUJAH. THAT WE CAN DANCE REALLY
[1:41:04] LIKE DAVID WANTED TO DANCE. WE CAN WALK
[1:41:07] LIKE DAVID WANTED TO WALK. WE CAN SPEAK
[1:41:09] LIKE DAVID REALLY WANTED TO SPEAK.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:41:13] [applause and cheering]
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; We have the GREATEST OPPORTUNITY. WE
[1:41:21] HAVE THE GREATEST WE'RE BLESSED. WE'RE
[1:41:23] LIVING IN A season of grace as brother
[1:41:25] Jonathan preached. AND WE'RE LIVING
[1:41:26] UNDER SUCH A BLESSED TIME THAT THIS
[1:41:29] FIERY TRIAL HAS COME INTO YOUR LIFE AS
[1:41:31] THAT DEITY WOULD SPEAK. AMEN. THAT GOD
[1:41:33] WOULD PUT ON FLESH AND LIVE OUT OF YOUR
[1:41:35] LIFE. IT'S NOT HERE TO DESTROY YOU. IT'S
[1:41:37] NOT HERE TO BEAT YOU DOWN. IT'S NOT HERE
[1:41:39] TO CRUSH YOU. IS THAT GOD WOULD GET YOU
[1:41:41] IN A POSITION THAT GOD COULD TAKE YOUR
[1:41:43] VOCAL CORDS, BYPASS YOUR MIND AND SPEAK
[1:41:46] LIKE DEITY, HE SPEAKS. AMEN. THE SAME
[1:41:48] VOICE THAT SAID, "LET THERE BE SUN,
[1:41:49] MOON, AND STARS." THAT SAME ONE LIVES IN
[1:41:51] YOU AND HE WANTS TO SPEAK OUT OF YOUR
[1:41:53] LIFE. SPEAK TO YOUR SITUATION. SPEAK TO
[1:41:56] THE ENEMY. AMEN. HE WANTS TO USE you to
[1:41:59] do it. That's why he allows fiery trials
[1:42:01] to come. I mean, we just have a longing.
[1:42:03] God, help us AND DO THIS. NO, HE WANTS
[1:42:05] TO TAKE YOU AND SPEAK TO YOUR SITUATION.
[1:42:08] DON'T SIT BACK AND SAY, "NO, HE CAN'T
[1:42:10] use me." He can use anybody. Amen. HE'LL
[1:42:13] RAISE UP ALI RATS. HE'LL RAISE UP
[1:42:15] STONES. HE'LL RAISE UP ANYONE HE WANTS
[1:42:17] TO. HE'S GOD. AND THIS TRANSFORMING
[1:42:19] POWER OF HIS BLOOD CLEANSES US THAT
[1:42:21] THERE'S NO SIN. THERE'S NOT EVEN
[1:42:22] REMEMBERED IN HIS MIND. IT DOESN'T
[1:42:24] MATTER WHERE WE COME FROM. GOD WILL HAVE
[1:42:26] A TESTIMONY IN this end time. And he'll
[1:42:29] use you and I to have it.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Why not? Why not let God live through
[1:42:37] you like David wanted?
[1:42:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:44] Hallelujah.
[1:42:47] You say, "Well,
[1:42:50] I should I just want to read this one
[1:42:52] more thing because condemnation's a lie.
[1:42:56] Condemnation is a lie from the pit of
[1:42:57] hell. And we don't have to live under
[1:43:00] condemnation. People were talking to me
[1:43:02] in the Philippines about if they move or
[1:43:03] they do something, what if I what if I
[1:43:05] get cursed? And just struck me. How can
[1:43:08] you be cursed? Jesus became a curse for
[1:43:12] us when he hang on Calvary. He took our
[1:43:15] curse. You can't be cursed. You're
[1:43:18] blessed. You're blessed to the Lord. I'm
[1:43:20] not saying this just casually,
[1:43:21] haphazardly. If you're the bride of
[1:43:24] Jesus Christ, sure, you may put a foot
[1:43:27] and God will bring correct you, but you
[1:43:28] don't get cursed.
[1:43:30] People are so worried about stepping out
[1:43:32] of the favor of God and I'm going to put
[1:43:34] a foot wrong and God's you and the
[1:43:35] devil's going to destroy my life. We
[1:43:37] don't live that way. God is my shield.
[1:43:40] God is my strength. God is my fortress
[1:43:43] and what he has blessed he has blessed
[1:43:45] and he cannot reverse it. I mean even
[1:43:47] even see God would speak through Balum
[1:43:50] prophet
[1:43:52] true gift but a wrong vessel and God
[1:43:54] would actually tell Moab Moab this is
[1:43:56] what I think of my people. I see you
[1:43:58] know iniquity in Jacob. I mean what I've
[1:44:01] blessed I have blessed and I cannot
[1:44:02] reverse it. So if he's blessed your life
[1:44:04] AND YOU SAY HOW DO I KNOW I'M BLESSED?
[1:44:06] IS IT HOW RICH I am? No. Is it how easy
[1:44:08] life is? No. Is it my job? No. Is it my
[1:44:12] house? No. It's got nothing to do with
[1:44:14] it. The blessing is you receive the word
[1:44:16] FOR YOUR DAY AND YOU BECOME BLESSED.
[1:44:18] AMEN. YOU BECOME SPIRITUALLY BLESSED.
[1:44:20] AMEN. IF GOD HAS GIVEN YOU THE ABILITY
[1:44:22] TO BELIEVE AND RECEIVE HIS WORD, YOU'RE
[1:44:25] THE MOST BLESSED PERSON TO STRIKE THE
[1:44:26] EARTH. WHY? BECAUSE GOD'S FAVOR HAS
[1:44:28] FOUND YOU. AMEN. GOD'S FAVOR AND
[1:44:30] BLESSING IS UPON YOUR LIFE. AND WHAT GOD
[1:44:32] HAS BLESSED REMAINS BLESSED. DOESN'T
[1:44:35] MATTER WHAT COMES AND GOES. TROUBLE, IT
[1:44:36] DOESN'T. THAT'S IRRELEVANT. YOU'RE A
[1:44:38] BLESSED PERSON. YOU AIN'T CURSED. DON'T
[1:44:40] LET THE DEVIL THINK YOU'RE A CURSE. NO.
[1:44:42] HE BECAME OUR CURSE ON CALVARY. HE TOOK
[1:44:45] YOUR JUDGMENT ON CALVARY. HE TOOK THE
[1:44:47] WRATH THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED. HE
[1:44:48] TOOK IT ON CALVARY THAT YOU CAN WALK
[1:44:50] FREE.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. If you're part of his word, how
[1:44:54] can he curse his word? He can't curse
[1:44:57] his word. He is his word. Amen. So by
[1:44:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you
[1:45:01] become part of the word.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; You're predestinated to it. But God
[1:45:05] quickened you THAT YOU BECOME PART of
[1:45:07] the scripture.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. God can't curse his word. That's
[1:45:11] why he couldn't take out Sarah when she
[1:45:13] doubted THE PROMISE GIVEN TO ABRAHAM.
[1:45:15] She was part of the promise. I mean, you
[1:45:17] got to realize there may be family
[1:45:18] members fussing, fighting, AND DIFFERENT
[1:45:20] LIKE SARAH WAS. JUST KEEP AN ATMOSPHERE
[1:45:22] OF LOVE around you. Just praise the Lord
[1:45:24] in your heart. AMEN. SPEAK FAITH, SPEAK
[1:45:26] PEACE, SPEAK THE REALITY OF THE WORD.
[1:45:28] WHAT HAPPENS? YOU CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE
[1:45:29] AND that atmosphere will begin to get
[1:45:30] them.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; So God can't curse his word.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; How can he curse you
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; if you're part of the word?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Why should we why should we worry then?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I'll read a quote
[1:45:48] because Jesus said, "If you add one word
[1:45:50] to this or take one word from it, our
[1:45:52] part will be taken out of the book of
[1:45:53] life." seen no not one scripture you
[1:45:55] must uh you must take it the way it's
[1:45:57] written and God watches over his word to
[1:45:59] perform it and we know that it's got to
[1:46:02] be just right he watches over you right
[1:46:06] so therefore no matter what the church
[1:46:07] would say what anyone else would say if
[1:46:09] you're born of the spirit of God you
[1:46:11] become part of the Bible some people
[1:46:13] like quotes I'm just going to read this
[1:46:14] to you okay you become part of the Bible
[1:46:17] told Ezekiel he the prophet said take
[1:46:18] the scroll eat it then the prophet and
[1:46:20] the scroll became part of each other and
[1:46:22] That's the believer when he receives the
[1:46:24] Holy Ghost. The Holy Spirit wrote the
[1:46:26] Bible and the spirit of God is the word
[1:46:28] of God. My word is spirit. In the
[1:46:31] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:46:32] with God. The word was God and the word
[1:46:34] was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:46:36] Hebrews 13:8. He's the same yesterday,
[1:46:37] today, and forever. And when you are
[1:46:40] part of that word, oh, then let
[1:46:42] something come up contrary to that word.
[1:46:44] There's a little buzzer goes off right
[1:46:45] quick. I'm just going to leave abruptly.
[1:46:48] I know I've taken too much time. Let's
[1:46:50] have the musicians this morning. You
[1:46:52] don't realize I'm part of the word.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I can't be cursed. I can't be out of his
[1:46:56] favor. I can't be lost. I mean, I'm part
[1:46:59] of him. And so, every in summary, fiery
[1:47:03] trials are to make us hot on fire for
[1:47:05] God. Every trial in my opinion is a
[1:47:08] fiery trial. Okay?
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Right? So, so just put it under that
[1:47:12] category. Fiery trial. What's it going
[1:47:15] to do? Make me on fire for God. If we
[1:47:19] are hot, then we cannot speak for
[1:47:21] ourselves.
[1:47:23] You can't. If you're lukewarm, you can.
[1:47:25] But if you're on fire for God, you
[1:47:26] cannot speak for yourself. Your the word
[1:47:29] of God will speak through you. So, thank
[1:47:31] God for the fiery trials.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. [applause]
[1:47:40] So, I think we can rejoice this morning.
[1:47:42] Amen. Let's stand, shall we? Praise the
[1:47:45] Lord for the fiery trials.
[1:47:47] It's not here to break you. It's here to
[1:47:49] make you. Amen. Let's sing that song.
[1:47:51] Why would I worry when giants come
[1:47:53] calling my name?
[1:47:56] Amen. I won't be shaken. I'm I I am
[1:48:00] unmovable. Your humanity know the word
[1:48:03] of God in my soul. Amen. Let's sing
[1:48:06] this, shall we?
[1:48:08] Amen.
[1:48:12] Why would I worry when giants come
[1:48:15] calling my name?
[1:48:21] Oh my God is so much bigger than the
[1:48:25] troubles I face.
[1:48:31] Why would I hunger for power or riches
[1:48:36] or way?
[1:48:41] My God is so much bigger than all of
[1:48:45] [music] these things.
[1:48:50] I won't be shen.
[1:48:55] I won't be moved.
[1:49:00] My God is faithful.
[1:49:04] His promise is true.
[1:49:09] So I speak to [music] the mountain.
[1:49:14] Oh, it's time to move.
[1:49:19] Cuz my God is bigger, [music]
[1:49:22] better, stronger, greater than you.
[1:49:30] My enemies scatter. They know the battle
[1:49:35] is done.
