entrusting it's not in running but in resting it's not in wandering but in praying that we find the strength of the lord oh it's not trying but entrusting it's not in running but in resting it's not in wandering but in praying that we find the strength of the lord he's all we need for our every need we never need to be alone still here let us go if we choose to to live life on our own than the only good that could ever be sad of the pains we find ourselves in there are places to go the wisdom to say i'll never leave him again oh it's not i'm trying but entrusting it's not in running but in resting it's not in wondering that i'm praying that we find the strength of the lord oh it's not in trying but entrusting it's not in running but in resting it's not in wandering but in praying that we find the strength of the lord it's not and wandering it's in praying that we find the strength [Applause] [Music] god bless you thank you so much for those two songs from my sisters god bless you they've got loaded words that are very true and um i wasn't i wasn't i plan to sing then i changed my mind and then then i was with the sunday school we they wanted to sing with me and right now i'm can tell you they feel betrayed by me because our deal was to come together but we didn't practice properly so just forgive me little children i love you so much they are such wonderful so if i may brother isaac um just just a short one quickly um that you know um as a child of god you don't want to be reminded one day you know you don't want to be reminded when when the time is gone that that you should have told your brother that you love him or you love her you don't want to be reminded one day to realize that ah i should have thought better about her about him oh i should have prayed for her you know it might be a little bit too late across the line you know i don't want to be refreshed later on that ha [Music] i miss her or i miss him you know why i'm saying this is that i lost a friend of mine this week a very close friend of mine and he was a deacon for many years and he spoke to me some time ago he said but import and say how are you doing there in new zealand and they gave me a call later on and we chatted he was like a young father you know that kind of a person that you're not the same age but your friends and and his family was just being very nice to us as young students at university you know we knew if we need food we go to his house we knew that you know he loved us very much yet he had our best interests at heart but now i realize that i miss him i realize that now i feel i want to give him something you know i feel i feel i miss him just ask him for me him do you have 100 there do you have 100 there for me you know i just miss that and and in life sometimes you sit there and maybe maybe you even get annoyed by sister media asking you do you have 250 dollars for me you get annoyed sorry media oh sister maggie ask you something you get annoyed by your brother or your sister you get irritated why because we are wearing this flesh that is so limited one day your brother or your sister is gone you miss that thing that you were annoyed for her or for him to do it to you for you you miss it why because actually you laugh you always love that brother that sister just the devil wanted to to make it as if there's a is a thing between you so that's what came to me you know this week when i thought of about about my brother william i always miss him but not much about him he's gone on waiting for us to come thank you so much brother isaac for the choice of songs this morning and they just blended so well with sister deborah and sister sheridan those songs that they sung so my song just remind me about going you know i've been thinking lately that lord if there's so many believers that are going actually lord why don't you just take us all and we just go so it was a bit selfish because maybe some of us are not ready yet maybe me myself i'm not ready but because it's just become so overwhelming but you know god is preparing his children because there's a scripture in the bible that says we cannot all go we cannot all go which means there are going to be some who are going to go that is what it means my sister that which means there are some who are going to go but we cannot all go but we cannot go ahead of those ones that have gone on before us for they shall resurrect and we shall see them and when we see them we know that we are going so going before the rapture is a given we are going to go some of us some of us we are not going to go and when i think of that and what god is doing i feel like singing this song that says i feel like traveling on and i don't know if the band can play it for me in the way that i would love to uh i want to play it my way or to sing it the way that it will please the lord and you [Music] it goes i feel like traveling on [Music] my heavenly home is bright and fair i feel like traveling on oh yes i feel like traveling long i feel like traveling world my heavenly home is my heavenly home is bright and full i feel like traveling on no pain no death can enter [Music] [Music] i feel like traveling alone that heavenly my shame shall be mine i feel like do you feel like i'm anyone this morning oh i feel like [Music] listen [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] the lord has been so good to me i feel like [Music] oh yes i feel like [Music] oh yes i feel like i feel like my hair is [Music] i mean let's just stand this morning and continue [Music] lord we come to you in worship lord we come to you in worship no matter what the search can stand no matter what the same [Music] we will live [Music] of you [Music] hello [Music] hello [Music] lord we come to you in worship lord [Music] no matter what this is we will live [Music] hello [Music] [Music] worship [Music] is [Music] one more [Music] you [Music] how we long to worship [Music] [Music] how [Music] how we one more time softly [Music] hello [Music] hello how we lost [Music] me [Music] you you are alpha you are [Music] you we give you all the glory [Music] [Music] you [Music] we give you all the glory we worship you we give you all the glory [Music] oh [Music] we worship you [Music] hallelujah amen he's worthy to be praised this morning hallelujah thank you brother isaac thank you positions amen praise the lord amen let the redeemed of the lord say so amen hallelujah amen praise our god amen let's just go straight into the scriptures this morning we're going to read from revelations 1. amen thank you for your prayers for little abby um as you know she was flown up to starship hospital um they are looking at moving her out of icu she's a bit more responsive and talking and but not quite coherent but you know she's she's more in the land of the living so amen just keep them in prayer by the emerson says susanna and the family amen um so we're going to read revelations 1 and verses 9 just down to 11. that's got a little thought here he says i john no means everyone praise the lord we're going to heaven i believe we're going to heaven i believe we're going to make it because he made it for us amen and it's not just us it's going amen i john who also am your brother and companion and tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ who was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me of great voice as of a trumpet saying i'm alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia and to ephesus under smyrna under pergamus and under thyatira unto sardis and under philadelphia and unto ladies amen we're just going to finish reading there let's just bow he's in a word of prayer shall we if you ever need you and raise your hand to the lord our god our god hasn't forgot us amen he's mindful of every situation every need we have gracious heavenly father lord we want to give you praise we want to give you glory lord just to think we can say our father which are in heaven hallow be thy name oh lord how great you are lord you're all of our father we're all your children we believe there go we're part of the mystical body of christ by one spirit we're baptized into that one body i want to thank you lord we can come to you this morning give your glory lord you do deserve all the glory honor and praise lord lord you're going to take us up into heaven soon and very soon lord there's going to be a translation of a living people lord from this world to the next lord but before that happens the dead and christ are going to raise we're going to have one great big family reunion lord before you take us lord and lord to that wedding supper in the sky we look forward to that day dear god we just want to lift our needs before your throne we thank you dear god that every need lord you have the answer to every need father we so we want to commit our situation into your hands lord just want to especially pray for the little abby oh god there in hospital we thank you lord for your wonder working power thank you lord jesus lord that by your stripes she is healed and so lord i pray you just strengthen her o god may you be the doctor may you be the nurse lord father may you granted in the situation be it brother emerson says to susannah lord may just raise their faith oh god give them such an unwavering courage and faith in you please may you granted father and lord you see every everything we're going through at the moment every trial the lord we lift up our heads and look unto you because our help comes from you oh god i want to thank you dear lord jesus we just pray dear god that you're just lord as we've read a couple of scriptures i just pray you'd anoint it lord make it live to every heart oh god i may walk out of here our joy's full lord jesus may you grant it for your glory in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning you just want to turn me down a little bit um i want to talk i just want to take that little uh peace there and brother brown tells us that it's not the uh amount of text you know that you read necessarily but it's what's in it that really matters we know the word of god is eternal even even the scripture jesus wept is an incredible powerful scripture but the about it says that i was in the spirit on the lord's day now the prophet tells us that if before we do anything we need to get into the spirit amen and and and the reason that that that john was in the spirit is because god was gonna show him certain things now when you see something it's incredibly powerful there's a reality that comes to it right you know there's a yeah you know there's that you know it's more than just something imagine but you actually see it you comprehend it so here's john and god comes he says i was in the spirit now the most important thing to do is get in the spirit first and then god can work you know that's why we have song servers that's why we enter in when we sing we get to praise and worship god it's because we want to enter into his spirit because we need to get into his spirit first and then the supernatural can happen i mean we serve a supernatural god today i mean he can do anything i mean he's not limited by anything amen he's the almighty unlimited jesus christ i mean so the first thing we need to do is get into the spirit now this may be very elementary but brother bam says in questions and answers 1954 he says now we've got to get in the spirit of the last days when the last days are here it says you go to a dance hall you've got to get in the spirit of dancing or they won't dance you go to the church you've got to get in the spirit of worship before you can worship the world's got to get in the spirit of the last days before the last days can come and we're in the spirit of the last days and god promised that these things would be here that's what we've got we're in the last days he says that men and women are getting asleep and don't realize it so you know we don't want to fall asleep you know i think it was the last part of pilgrim's progress as they were on the way to the celestial city was right there and they kept you had to wake each other up they were falling asleep on the path and you know we don't want to fall asleep in these last days but we want to get in the spirit of the lord amen that he will show us not only things that are to come but to show us our current state i mean because when you can see what he has done for you amen that puts a real shout in you that puts a real joy that puts a real happiness your heaviness just leaves your joy comes amen when we can see really what the lord has done you know i believe in a pentecostal worship i believe in a i believe this message is pentecostal not in the denominational sense but in the reality as god has restored us back to the faith of the fathers and the faith of the fathers in the book of acts not their failures not their humanity but god abiding and dwelling in a people was a pentecostal worship a pentecostal walk where god dwelled in the people and showed them and manifested the liberty that he won for them that day on calvary but you've got to get into the spirit that's why you can't just sit there like a dead stump you've got to enter in i mean if you know if you if you ever go to a place and not enter into the spirit you'll never get really what wants to be given to you i mean so we here in church you know the holy ghost is here he wants to minister something to us he wants to do something in our lives but we've got to enter into it you've got to be a part yeah you just can't be sitting on the benches watching you got to be part of it you know you're all the highs and the lows and you know you know there's the olympics are going on at the moment the people who are really entering in are getting into the spirit of the olympics you know those maybe they can't be in the stands because they're covered with those on tv they get up all crazy hours of the morning you know night time they're cheering for their country they're excited you know because they get into the spirit of it but how could you ever just sit there you know and say well that was nice and you maybe it's been the record smash of the century an incredible game or whatever and but you know if you're not in the spirit of it you're not going to enjoy what's going on because you're not in the spirit and those who get in the spirit look at those who are not in the spirit they think what's wrong with that person because those who are in the spirit are enjoying what the spirit is producing that's the same thing with our god you know those who are in the spirit hallelujah rejoice what god is doing amen but though and they look at those who are not in the spirit they say what's wrong with that person not looking at anyone right now but you know our god is a supernatural god you know david we would read here and um and and second kings let's go here to second kings i just want to um you know there's more for us you know the devil's been fighting me all week so you know what i've been reading this book it's really blessed me actually it's been um it's called the light of days and it's actually testimonies of women jewish resistance fighters in world war ii in the in the warsaw ghetto uprising all different ones and these and these and these women so so they looked they were jewish but they looked more uh european than jewish they could blend in with with with society they're in poland different things and they were the secret couriers who are courier messages take weapons and things and they had to bluff their way past the guards gestapo false papers all kinds of things but they did these things because they came to a conclusion because they they come to realize that they were all going to be exterminated so they decided i'd rather choose how i'm going to die they realize they're going to die they're either going to die in a concentration camp or they're going to die fighting the nazis and they decided i'm going to choose the day of my death i'm not going to let the enemy take my life i'm going to give my life for this cause it's the same thing with you and i all of humanity's gonna die one day right every single one you'll either die now as in give your life to christ and be born again and then you can never die all you die eternally one day i but so i've decided i'm going to choose the day i die and i died in 2007. hallelujah that's the day i died to myself and met the lord jesus christ and we might as well kill a few devils while we're here hallelujah amen yeah the odds may be stacked against us but in reality if god be for us who can be against us but they just decided i'm just gonna you know they decided they knew they couldn't win but i said might as well take as many as we can should be the same thing even though we know we're going to win but why why why be dumb driven cattle why do what everyone else can do everyone else can go the way of the world why do whatever everyone's like i want to be unique i want to be have my own identity and they try and have their own style of clothes and the way things they listen to and how they walk and talk and they just end up like everyone else oh but i'm you know i'm you know no you just they just like become like everyone else i've been there done that i'm glad i don't have the t-shirt no more right so but why not do what bill why not actually be unique and actually serve god amen but you got to get into the spirit now where were we second kings yeah okay that's where we're going wasn't it did i say that okay second kings three ten to fifteen we're going to be very careful at the response we have our god supernatural our god is not put in a box you know you know the most dead religion there is is western christianity you take the all the denomination the anglican church the lutheran church the catholic church the orthodox ways of pious you know i remember sitting i had to endure chapel three days a week at an anglican boarding school i had i said endure and you had a sheet of paper we'll now stand up and say this who's endured this kind of thing repeat and the priest says this you say this and he says this and you say this you sit here and they do this you stand here you sing this and it's just all this you go through this i don't know what it is but that's the devil making a mockery out of worship and you can actually take it into the modern era where it's just all lights and smoke machines and fan dangles nonsense and that's another mockery but in reality real heartfelt worship is not a dead form it's not just conforming to some idea of this is how christianity should be and based on culture or creed or whatever no no worship's not that way and david was that kind of man where he wasn't conformed to how people thought he should worship i mean because all he cared about was pleasing god hallelujah and he had a response can you imagine you know the most glorious thing you could have in your possession as king is the ark hallelujah and it had been in the philistine lands it had been there over edom's house and different things but finally it's coming into a city and it's coming the right way hallelujah and he begin to get excited and i think we should get excited i think this word should excite us i think this message should excite us i mean we hear about the fifth seal say hallelujah or the sixth seal or the seventh sea of the lord coming self-dwelling in you and i or whatever part of the word is it should excite us it should ignite a passion amen that our god is god i mean he's the god of gods everything else just some dead idol that's a fake amen but we have the real genuine lord jesus christ a man should excite us that we should realize we are his children we are his victory i mean we are his purchase possession hallelujah so he began to dance he didn't ask anyone else about what he should do he wasn't worried about the cod of life that's not cod fish that's conduct order and doctrine he wasn't too worried about that because he realized he was in the spirit you know i tell a joke because i want people to relax people get so you know this is not an exam you're not sitting in front of some policemen getting interrogated you know this is not some you know are you with me do you agree or i don't think there's a police station i'm not barely in blue today maybe i'm undercover anyway but you know so he sees the ark coming and and all he because he has a heart he loves god he loves god he loves jehovah amen he was anointed by him amen as a shepherd boy then finally the ark's coming and he begins to dance and he begins to dance and he begins to dance and he doesn't ask anyone he doesn't care how people see him do it he's not worried about if he's in time or out of time or whatever time but he's in tune with the spirit of the composer amen because he began to see he got in the spirit and he began to see god's coming into my city i mean jehovah god created heavens and earth is going to dwell in my city and he began to dance and dance and dance and dance but there was someone else who was watching the possession now his his worship spread everyone else was rejoicing how could you not it's infectious i mean people are worried about a virus and i forgive me for saying it this way but the holy ghost spreads it's contagious but you've got to get into the right atmosphere in yourself remember you know god could be filling someone right now next year they could be having a jubilee time and you could be sitting there saying what's wrong with those people just get in the spirit get in the spirit just enjoy what's going on and then but there was another person sitting there and she looked out her window and she was a king's daughter and she felt entitled because of her position well i'm in the message and this is who my parents are blah blah and she began to look down and saw her husband dancing and she wasn't in the same spirit she was actually in the spirit of being scornful and she actually was she was actually detested what her husband was doing and he was in the spirit of god we must be very careful our attitude towards what god does amen if i see god do something i say i want some of that i want him to live not just for that person i'm glad when god touches someone else but what about me i'm here too here's my cup lord i fill it up lord hallelujah so she began to look out and because she thought well he's embarrassing me what will the other woman at court think here's my husband dancing and you know expose whatever himself and he he's dancing around and you know he's going to embarrass me you know and then finally there's all pent up in her but she should have just got in the spirit she didn't see because she if she got in the spirit that was on her husband then she would have been dancing too hallelujah oh hey this is infectious amen our god reigns the lord god omnipotent reigneth hallelujah and then she looks out and then finally after all said and done now are we in second king when i say that i'm asking myself am i there now wait no that's not where we should be ii samuel ii samuel i actually put a thing here amen you know brother bram he says sometimes you know he wants to act the most you know but he's trying to behave he actually says it that way and you know you know what he said you know he used to stand there by the pulpit like this because of the microphones right this is how he used to stand because the mark he didn't have this kind of thing going on and he actually said he wanted a web mic that's the technology they had so basically a whole bunch of mics hangs from the ceiling so you could preach up and down the whole place and beforehand apparently before i was ever recorded he'd just preach up and down the whole yo the whole time he wasn't just standing because some people think you need pulpit manners what's pulpit manners i didn't go i didn't learn this at some school of etiquette and you know i met god on my knees down on my knees i met my jesus down on my knees i found the lord amen and he became real to me i mean he changed my life it wasn't just a nice idea conforming to some mould of a religion i met him and he transformed my life hallelujah he's still the same today i mean so who cares about pulpit manners pure manners just praise god hallelujah hey the joy of the lord is our strength it keeps us strong not our reasoning not our situation as the joy of the lord is our strength i mean to realize that our sins have been washed away having to realize that there's nothing held against us it doesn't matter what fights us what comes against us you know what i love okay we'll get there but let's just go somewhere else first you know what i love about god is he causes you to know that your sins are gone he wants you to know not just that to i hear my no for you to know you take the children of israel moses would prophesy they were there by the red sea they were all panicking god just said to moses speak and go forward and so moses didn't know how it was going to be done but he would stand there the people of israel are there the reds he's not parted he says you see these egyptians today you'll see them no more forever that's what he said he didn't know how it was going to happen now god could have done it in such a way that the red sea parted and israel crossed over then the red sea closed and then maybe they think well our enemies away there somewhere they can't get to us so now we won't see them now forever because they're gone but that's not what god does he actually caused pharaoh's armies to come into a death trap hallelujah and then he he allowed israel to look and watch the sea come down and drown them and kill them all i mean that they would begin to realize amen they would see that their enemy is dead and the reason they'll see them no more forever is because they drown it's the same thing with the blood of jesus christ amen the lord allows us to pass through holy but the enemy chases us but he can't get through and the blood covers him and destroys them and then we see that it's all drowned amen we see it's all gone hallelujah and it's not just i hear my sins are gone no god drops a revelation into your heart i mean that nothing can be held against you that you're a free person you've got liberty now amen whom the son is set free is free indeed hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah get into the spirit of it you'll begin to enjoy it hallelujah hallelujah but the only thing that could torment them now is a memory oh egypt's still over that sea oh remember those task masters but then i begin to realize he died she died that horrible task master where'd you get those whips whip marks daddy this one this one this one all that scary daddy no dora he died sorry that thing's dead there's actually trophies now that god god allowed me he actually destroyed the one that put the beatings on me i mean that devil that tormented the family for generations that died hallelujah he got drowned you don't need to be afraid of a memory anymore i mean because you got to bring that memory into present day and say well what happened to it it died i mean that sin died i mean by the blood of jesus christ hallelujah amen so don't be tormented by a memory because you know the devil only gives you a partial truth remember that sin that you couldn't get over and hear and and then people go oh it's back again no it's not back again the devil's trying to haunt you by a memory but then bring remind him of what happened that day when the lord dethroned satan out of your heart then he took his abode hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen so here's david he's dancing we'll come back there and he's rejoicing because that's a mark that was carried through the red sea that was carried over jordan carried into jail and the waters parted that was carried around jericho amen that made the walls fell down flat when they shouted they blew the trumpets i mean that same arc was coming into the city and he began to dance he began to cut up and rejoice and hallelujah hallelujah i believe in this kind of thing i mean this is not a show i mean i believe this kind of thing i can even put myself there here comes the word hallelujah it's been in a foreign land amen he's been away he's been far from us but he belongs to us then now the lord comes back i mean the word is returned and the lamb takes the book opens the seals and he takes away all denominational creeds of man ideas strikes it off the title deed amen opens the seals gives it to you and i it says here's your cost here's your inheritance amen here's the title amen to the land you know what i love about you know christina talking about this it says in ephesians that the holy ghost we have received is the earnest of our inheritance it's the down payment brother graham says so it's so it's a down payment and god gives you the down payment because there's more to have but the evidence here you've got more to get is because you've got the down payment amen you've already got the down payment i mean so now hallelujah we've got the body change already i mean we've got salvation already we've got healing already we've got deliverance already we've got overcoming power already i mean we've got a hallelujah the dead in christ is going to come forth amen because we've got the down payment holy our families are coming back amen because we've got the down payment hallelujah everybody joins speaker for the glory because you've got the down payment hallelujah hallelujah i've already got and you can go shouting yo if i had i don't have money okay just pretend i got google pay i can go buy a loaf of bread hallelujah why because i've got the money here i can go rejoicing on my way because i have the funds i need to get what i need harley and i'm not sitting here but the thing is i have to put it into action believing i can use this to go buy a loaf of bread i mean if i can't believe the funds on here can buy the loaf of bread i won't go get it it may seem very real you may see the price and see the digits on here but i've got to put faith into action it's the same thing with you and i amen you know the bank of heaven never comes back unlimited funds it never comes back empty it never we don't have checks anymore but checks don't bounce you know other so we can go put our faith into action and begin to praise god holy and say thank you jesus the answer is on its way amen hallelujah that's why we should be a happy people the answer is coming the answer's coming hallelujah we've already got the answer it's on its way it's not a far off it's not days from hands it could be right now you got to let your faith loose just get in the spirit say amen hallelujah hallelujah now that reminds me of a quote if i can find it he says if you get into the spirit it's not jumping out of me right now you get into the spirit just like if you're sick and you get anointed with oil you get into the spirit first then you go through the function of the word and then brother bam says in the mind of god in the economy of god it's already done you've got to get into the spirit first i mean it's a david's dancing his wife is scorning see you can get into many different spirits it's not just the spirit of the lord and nothing there's no voids in this world there's no voices either god or satan i mean it's a great conflict we're talking about that as well the great conflict in god and satan there's not there's not neutral parties i mean there's no neutral countries in this conflict like in other conflicts it's either you're for us or against us you're either for god or against god i'd be on god's side because i know who wins he's the winner of this conflict hallelujah and so there's no so you can be in the spirit of many different things there's a spirit of unbelief amen there's a spirit of selfishness unforgiveness business it all comes from the devil there can be religious spirits that people won't take the full counsel of god but we want to be in the spirit of the lord because the spirit of the lord you get into his spirit he begins to show you things they though they may not appear now though that but they are right they're on their way just like john on the isle of patmos he saw from his time to until there was no time into eternity hallelujah amen so we must get in the spirit now he says here this is in separation from unbelief he says shame on you people that don't believe in music that brings the spirit of the lord sometimes god doesn't change if he liked it then he likes it now well you say i've got to live if you can't be elisha and we'll get there uh be the one of the instruments or be one of the minstrel strings then do something or do something for the lord because it altogether brought the spirit of god that's right the presence of the prophet and the playing of the minstrels and they began to play some good old hymn upon these stringed instruments and beat the tambourine and they got and they all got into the spirit you know what here's another thing now this is the prophet maybe well we won't read it but to save time that was second kings i believe three that there's the king second kings three we'll get to somewhere else some other time second kings three and ten and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab now god didn't do anything in this it was actually their own plans you know we can blame god for our own misfortune but get into the spirit first and then you'll be fine but jehoshaphat said is there not is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may inquire uh of the king of israel and sorry main choir of the lord by him and one of the king of israel's servant sajdah said here is elisha the son of shafat which poured water on the hands of elijah and jehoshaphat said the word lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of eden went down to him and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said unto nay for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely where were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee so elisha was was was was fussy he was grumpy he says you know why don't you go talk to your your mama's prophets go talk to the prophets of baal it wasn't for this godly king i wouldn't even look at you so he's all kind of bound up and you know his righteous incarnation got the better of him but then elijah said is the lord of hosts liveth oh sorry verse verse 15. but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him so now if we all get bound up and fussy the spirit of god can't come upon us that's why we have a good trouble sunday morning maybe it's just my house maybe it's just me myself is the problem but you know but yeah or wednesday afternoon there's things that whenever an issue become a big issue this is going to be sorted right now and it's going to oh it's the end of all things no it's not the end of all things just put the cup there we'll be fine you know but you know but why it's because the dev once it's all tight and stressed they would come and sit down and church and then we're just this big thing like this and then by the end of the service ah then we finally relax but service is done why don't get all relaxed in the spirit before you walk into these doors amen i'll enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart have a have have a song services you drive to church hallelujah i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them amen then you're fine i mean you'll be in the spirit before church even starts hallelujah amen so he says here and they begin i'll just repeat the first part here and they begin to play some good old hymn on these stringed instruments and beat the tambourine and they all got into the spirit you know what here's another thing him sitting there all stewed up about it is that or the other the spirit of god couldn't deal with him you've got to get away from that type of condition as i say don't be all like this in a million knots like some origami folder over a million times no just say it's the devil's course he's going to fight us of course you know we should expect it it's like summer should be hot winter should be cold it shouldn't be a surprise it's a season right but so i said of course the devil's gonna fight us before we come into these doors and i found before i came into the message i never had mine battle sitting in church but then i came into the message there's my bells of the devil the devil would tell me leave leave get up and walk out and i just told them no you leave i'm sitting here you get out oh that should help me that's how it should be shouldn't it amen you've got to get away from that type of condition i'm a methodist i'm a baptist dr jones don't believe in this my pastor said it's nonsense don't go down there don't listen to this you'll never see nothing you've got to get in the spirit amen amen he says in the patmos vision all right was in the spirit on the lord's day now remember the first thing you have to do is what get in the spirit that's how these revelations are ever going to come to you get in the spirit how are you ever going to get the holy ghost get in the spirit get in the spirit so if you need the baptism of the holy ghost get in the spirit and you'll get the holy ghost what how do you get in the spirit enter in amen amen be part of the service if no one is going to say amen say amen if no one else is going to sing sing no one else will raise their hands raise their hands you say well but the devil says but you're a hypocrite doing that no no no this is who i really am this is i'm a child of god amen this is who i really am that maybe the fussing stewing five minutes before before i entered this door that's not the real me that's just the carnal bit but the blood of jesus christ cleanse me from those things amen you know jesus died that we could serve him that's why the blood was shed that we could serve him amen he doesn't allot our mistakes to us because of the blood sure we've got to confess our sins to him but he washed us in his blood that we could serve him hallelujah yeah the devil's just a hypocrite he transforms himself as an angel of light hypocrite because the real hymn is not an angel of light he's an angel of death amen but he tries to say you're the hypocrite no no satan you're the hypocrite i just tell him to go i'm not leaving you can leave someone needs your seat get out talking to the devil by the way amen so we're gonna if you ever want the holy ghost get in the spirit when you was a sinner you went to a dance you got in that spirit oh my you started clapping your hands and patting your feet and shin digging and throwing your head on the floor and going around and around acting silly you was in that spirit could you imagine a fellow was a dance fiend going to a dance say well and you're all having a pretty good time i suppose oh they'd say you wallflower get out of here see you know go back to the olympics here's some commentator guy i can't remember his name and he's commenting about the rowing and he's excited and he's smiling a kiwi guy he's in the spirit of the thing but imagine being some commentator in new zealand has done great and whatever and say well that was a nice race and you know i've got to be two weeks quarantine when i go home and it's hot here uh sure yeah i'm sure it's been fine but will you wallflower get out you know but he's in the spirit amen you know the devil's the coldest thing there is he's worse than antarctica he will he will let you remember when we when we're in the world and we were drunk at a party doing crazy stuff he never told you you shouldn't do that don't do that don't get too part of this he was encouraging you go you can do it yeah oh was it there was no resistance there ain't no resistance there was actually a backward push pushing in pushing into it but then we come into the things of god and we get transformed by his spirit and the devil comes along he's not going to encourage you go child yeah i want to be under your feet i want you to stare stand by my head again i want you to cast me out go for it yeah i want another beating no he resists you you know don't be too happy this will be over soon just write it out don't you know brother brown says we want to act too human that's our problem we want to act too human we want to try and keep it all together and you know not lose ourselves you know you gotta you gotta give yourself over you gotta give yourself over to god you can't just stay composed and well i'm going to be this compo no no we're not statues i'm not a piece of stone that's been shaped in a dead form having a form of godliness you know a form you know christine's brother albert he he he does foundations for a living he's got a business he puts a form and then pours the concrete into that form we don't want to be poured into a dead form right we want to be a living people full of a living god amen so he says you you will flower get out of here go to a ball game somebody knock a home run or something another set and look well i guess that's pretty good now you have you weren't you wouldn't be a baseball fiend you wouldn't be a real you wouldn't be in the spirit of baseball when someone knocks a home run you raise up a hollow whoa oh my when knock somebody's hat off your head his head like that nobody says a word about it you know i remember sitting in the stands there in canterbury the rugby people would throw stuff in the air bottles and crazy stuff and paint themselves all different colors and yeah they did no one said a word about it no one said oh that guy's off oh that guy's too much in the deep end he's just he's just gone too much in the deeper you know he's been brainwashed and you know he's gone mad and oh whatever happened to that guy he was he had so much potential look what he's done no one says that they're like whoa they don't say praise the lord but they said they say praise the lord that one's really got something i wish i was like him that's how they are and when we come to church or yeah we become christians and people say oh they've just gone too far they've just gone fanatical about it you know they've gone overboard that's the devil brother m says here he says let me this is from the church age book now let me use another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we have all read it countless times but did it not get in the spirit but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask god for a spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the elders confess our sins this is this quote i was looking for be anointed and prayed for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in his spirit it's all over there is no other court of appeal god will fulfill his word oh we need to get in the spirit and when things and then things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what god will do have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things that are in the world they go to their ball games their sporting events and their dances they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like wall flowers all dried up sticks they enter right into the feel of things and become part of things oh how they hate christians for getting into the spirit of god's word they call us fanatics and holy rollers there is nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship our spirit is clean it's fresh it's real it is sober and serious but nevertheless see some people are just sober and serious but nevertheless full of the joy of the lord the christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the lord as the world is when it's savior's delights in its pleasure now in other words when italy ran and they won 100 meters and then they won the 100 meter i mean i mean the relay they didn't just finish and high-five each other and say well boys we must just go get our medal oh viva italia however they say they are shouting and rejoicing i and i on the streets of italy they're going italia yeah they were rejoicing and they were shouting and they are praising what they are exuberant and what their champions had done but my champion i mean he went to calvary for me hallelujah he took my sins upon his shoulders the joy set before him was me redeemed washed in his blood made in his image hallelujah he says no man takes my life from me i light down i'll raise it back up again and he gave his last breath on the cross he says it was finished hallelujah then he ascended down and down and down to the regions of the lost went down after preaching the souls in prison he went to satan went in there busted the door open and satan thought oh i've won i've got you now i thought i had you with abel and with noah and different ones down but then jesus said shut up satan i'm sick of your jabba-jabba amen i'm in charge now my blood is still on the cross i've redeemed adam's fallen race i redeemed benjamin john glenn that day hallelujah hallelujah i pay for his sins now give me the keys of hell death and the grave i'm in charge grabs the keys boots him back down to hell and then he ascends up into paradise hallelujah that's better than olympic gold any day amen and then in paradise the doors come open his presence goes before him and hallelujah and they're having a testimony meeting for eons of time however long it was talking about the king of glory hallelujah can you imagine david's in the spirit and i've said this before but it just always strikes me he's yo he's anointed he just cries out lift the up you everlasting gates and open up the everlasting doors that the king of glory shall come in holy maybe himself or a scribe would pin it down spirit's there so strong and then he and he says though i walk through the valley of the shadow death i'll fear no evil hallelujah hallelujah and then he finds himself on his deathbed amen he's put the kingdom in order he's told solomon he's going to be king in different things and he breathes his last breath he goes to the valley of the shadow of death but there's one who is with him from a shepherd boy hallelujah amen that takes him he doesn't have to worry is it going to be okay he was taken by the hand he's transported into paradise hallelujah hallelujah and then he's there he begins to testify of things that happened down on earth i saw the king of glory hallelujah amen i saw the city and i saw the cry of the redeemed saying lift the up the everlasting gates and be lifted up the king of glory shall come in where is he because there's not one believer that wants that that doesn't want to see him we all want to see him hallelujah we felt his presence but i yeah i do feel love now i trust you're in the spirit hallelujah and then finally they're fellowshipping lazarus comes in for four days then goes out again holy john the baptist comes in before that says i baptize the lamb of god hallelujah they begin to rejoice what they are being exuberant holy they weren't just sitting down and talking about quotes and scriptures are dead falling away they're rejoicing about a living word because they lived out that word they were part of that word they are testifying of what they manifested in their day hallelujah hallelujah and then and then the thief comes in hallelujah i i see myself as him somehow my life came and was kind of just his life you think about his life you think a christian's life shouldn't be a thief condemned to die and god the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord work that one out work that one out because he is righteous work that one out here he is a thief does all kinds of things maybe from a broken home who knows his background but then god actually engineers his steps to do these wicked things to stand in front of pilate on the same day jesus is crucified he just happened to be there he was in prison what do you think about it he ever put yourself there why was he crucified the day before or after the you know the next week no he just happened to be there in the same judgment hall as jesus hallelujah and he followed him up the hill he saw everything that was going on he wasn't scourged more than jesus was he didn't have a crown of thorns on there wasn't a big uh all the interest wasn't on this guy it was on this man of nazareth then finally he's pinned to the cross there's another thief on the other side and and there's a spirit there of ridicule and condemnation and the priest is standing around there's the disciples there crying and things but there's a priest there they're looking up in jesus face to finally maybe jesus wasn't too far off the ground i don't know how tall crosses were exactly but they said if you're really the king of israel if you're really the son of god take yourself off the cross prove it and he gets into the same spirit because this thief the other thief was making fun of jesus and this same thief was doing the same thing but then god and his sovereignty allowed him to look again and he saw that man with a crown of thorns the inscription over him and he's breathing his last he's struggling because crucifixion really is suffocation because you try and stand with your feet to hold up your body but you can't then your arms collapse like this and your diaphragm can't move so you can't breathe it's a struggle like this for hours and then so he's breathing his last you know because sometimes we read the scripture and we just hear jesus say father forgive them they don't know what they do just like some calm voice it wouldn't have been that way father forgive them and then so this thief looked again and he saw more than a man he saw the lamb of god maybe his parents told them about the messiah i don't know they said lord remember me when you come into my when you come into your kingdom god ordained his steps sometimes we think someone's life is very dark but god has them on a journey we have to believe he's they're going to come out of that journey we have to believe the lord is going to take them out of it see that's not that's why we don't look at their current step we look at where we believe they're going to end up that's why i've got to keep having faith amen you're not going to leave them in that predicament god you're going to bring them in hallelujah and then jesus looked at him and said today you'll be with me in paradise and then they come along and they break the thief's legs i don't know you know because jesus just gave up the ghost they come and break the thieves legs this man dies in horrible agony then he wakes up then he i would say wake up but he's in paradise he walks through the door holy hallelujah and then he begins to relate his testimony i was hanging right there i made fun of him like the other thief don't see him here that's beside the point but then he said today you'll be with me in paradise i'm here you're here where is he and then door comes open behind him hallelujah and then now jesus empties out he leads captivity captive ascends on high and then he begins to say come children let's go a little higher and then david when he was in his flesh and he was inspired saying lift the up you everlasting gates and be lifted up can let's just go back a bit can you imagine here's david he says my god my god why is that forsaken me they pass my hands and my feet and he's and as the holy ghost speaking through him first person like he's on the cross hallelujah and imagine now you've been inspired this and then the one who came to live that out steps through the door and then they're ascending on high they come to the great city and then david finds himself living out what he prophesied lift the up here for lasting gains and be lifted up that the king of glory shall come in and he's living the whole thing out hallelujah but do you think they were they weren't just what a noise you talk about an exuberant worship exuberant worship hallelujah but there was another exuberant worship 50 days after the crucifixion i mean there's 120 in the upper room i mean they've seen their lord crucified they've seen the term empty but they saw him rose again i mean he's a living christ amen thomas would put his hands in his side his your hands and his feet you know and and and the holes in jesus they'd say my lord and my god but they said wait in jerusalem to endured with power from on high hallelujah there they were in the upper room and you know brother man dramatize it you know that maybe maybe it's 45 days after the crucifixion see so he ascended on the 40th day maybe it's five days in when they're in the upper room maybe andrew gets up and says brothers i believe we've got it by faith you know i really i really believe a difference you know because we're in this nice atmosphere we're all believers here and you know you know and now but peter said no we have to wait until we're endured with power from on high there's got to be something coming to our lives brothers there's got to be something that comes into my life that when opposition comes i'm no longer a coward there's going to come a power into my life that when accusations come against me i cannot deny the lord anymore i need that power i don't believe i have it yet because something has not changed on the inside of the inside i mean it's the same thing with you and my friends this baptism of the holy ghost is real as a reality it makes us overcome the world it makes us not afraid to be a christian i mean it makes us not ashamed of the gospel and it gives us overcoming power that we will manifest the word i mean you see it's more than just having a desire to serve god but god has got to take you see it's more than just saying you believe the message brother abraham said in the token message they said but brother brahm we believe everything you've said he says that's good but that's just being able to read but many people take that oh praise the lord they've received the word they've really got the holy ghost no not necessarily because the life that's lived afterwards will be a manifestation of what they believe and it's not by human ability but god will come and live himself out of your eye amen that's what he said on the token see many people they get just a new spirit who knows some tongue from now ezekiel let's just go there shall we ezekiel 36 i believe and we'll go from verse 24. here we are for i will take you from among the heathen has he taken you hallelujah you may be living in the same house at the same address but he's taken you from spiritual darkness into marvelous light glory i'll take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land what is the land that we dwell in the word this is our promised land amen then i'll sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean and all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you i had a lot of idols in here but god just took a wrecking ball of his holy ghost and smashed it all down and it wasn't against my will see god won't come in against your will he won't force anything upon you you have to be willing that's why you've got to open your you know there was a couple of sundays ago christine said after the service was like the holy ghost was just flying around the church looking for a heart to enter into amen but brother brown says and it and he says in that message we we looked a few months ago but he says look he's moving around the church you just got to open yours fully surrender yourself and let him he's waiting he's waiting for someone to open themselves up that he'd come and dwell in them he's the same god now he's not a different one but you're gonna surrender this way we can't get all tense at all no just surrender in his presence i'll cleanse a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i'll take away the stony heart out of your flesh so what that is is actually god actually makes us changes us that we believe the bible's actually true that's taking the hosts stony heart away giving you a heart of flesh but notice this and i'll put he says and i will give wait let's start a new a new heart will i also give you in a new spirit what is that that's a desire to serve god right many people stop there but the humanity catches up with them their fallen nature catches up with them we don't want to just get to that stage this is a this gospel is the gospel of the kingdom which is god dwelling in people that's why he died on calvary that he can dwell in you and i that's his purpose that's what he wants to do and i will put my spirit within you where in verse 27 and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them how's that done because he puts his spirit within us to that that that way you'll walk in my statures you shall keep my judgments and do them right that's what we need that's why i've said many times he has to be the christian in you that's the only way it can be is when his holy ghost comes in i mean then he actually fulfills the word so it's not just a desire many people can be so bound up in the world but say god sent a prophet i believe the message the bible's true but they need god to come in and change their change them that he dwells in them that the things their first birth their first nature the sins they had don't rule them anymore but they get delivered amen now but you got to get in the spirit that's so important now isaiah 61 and 3. wait i don't have the whole thing here he says here he says to appoint unto you and zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified he was a trait beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning see the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness see we're gonna get into the spirit amen so now what happened on the day of pentecost as god came and dwelt in his church and gave them overcoming power not only over the devil but over themselves that god could actually take those 16 elements of flesh i mean i mean you know they made up their flesh and gave them overcoming power over this flesh amen and that's a reality this this is not seven steps to conforming to overcoming by the power of your mind no he has to come in and be the overcomer in you amen he says and jesus keeps all uh all of his appointments this is after the seals and and there's one thing i want to speak about after this he says now there she was with her here this is the woman wiping jesus's feet she began to wipe his feet with it and dry his feet off she was scared to death and after all she picked up this bottle of ointment and she broke it and she tried to hit it and break it and pour it on his feet she was crying and every time she would cry she'd reach down and kiss his feet she got hysterically when you get in his presence it makes you hysterically i got hysterically any man ever gets into his presence that believes him and has faith in him it makes you hysterically amen on the day of pentecost when he come in the form of the holy ghost they got hysterically when you really believe it and you know and you recognize it's your opportunity and you're in his presence you are sure of it so he doesn't say this you know he says whenever we get into the presence of god this is how people act right see there's a there's a spirit in the land that's always been here of unbelief that wants to make the church cold formal and powerless to take the joy of god out of the church to take real spiritual worship out of the church to take god moving out of the church this is it's it's always been here and it's epitomized to me in the old denominations um probably all of them now cold formal worship going through a well you've got to have these many songs and then this and the preacher preaches 45 minutes and then you do this and then you do it it's so rigidly bound that god can't move and people sit there nothing against it but you know it's j you know just sitting there but you know it just becomes such a see it's what's happening on the inside that's the most important thing right but but it gets such a rigid coldness that god can't move that is not what this message has come to bring this message has come to bring a real joy a real shouting a real dance amen you take david dance under the blood of bulls and ghosts what about under the blood of jesus christ i mean the children of israel on the red sea she took miriam took up a tambourine began to dance she didn't care she saw her enemy dead she didn't care about what everyone else was doing and when she led the church hallelujah amen those on the day of pentecost glory filled their souls they couldn't just sit there and say now that was a good meeting and i liked that quote and what their brother said no god came down i mean filled them holy the promise that was that they'd received powerful on high he came in he really came and they busted out that place and the people said these people are filled with new ones oh no it wasn't some carnal thing you know the problem is there's so many scarecrows today but scarecrows scare crows they scare crows they don't scare eagles they may intimidate them for a little bit but why you know people are so against shouting and running the aisles you know if god is doing it it's always an order but people are so afraid the reason is people are afraid to let go and let god that's that's the thing but people are so against it all because well look what these people have done and look what this movement did and look that's a scarecrow who cares about what they did this is me and my god right who get you there was some years ago god moved in this country in a powerful way and i'm just going to say this is public you know there's a christine here holy ghost fell in her tongue's interpretation god moved in church as was prophesied and churches around begin to have meetings about does he is this right or not and that is and how could you ever ask that question maybe i'll get backlash first i don't care but you know why would you ever ask if something's in the scripture if god put something in the church that's the devil that tries to take it out of the church right so if god puts speaking in tongues of the church it's in the church if god put prophecy in the church it's in the church if god put the sermon in the church it's in the church if god put knowledge in the church it's in the church if god put gifts of healing in the church it's in the church if god puts helps and governments in the church it's in the church it's still in the church because we have been restored back to apostolic faith right we have not been restored back to lectures of some baptist theology of just a nice thought and just putting scriptures together with no life that's not what this message is no we're being restored back to the book of acts amen as not just saying oh the prophet did this the pillar of fire was with him what about with you and i that's the same jesus with him as the same jesus with you and i the same one that met the apostle paul we must meet as well as the same jesus hallelujah amen but i stand against that kind of spirit i don't care how many quotes i can have to back it up there's no there's no quote to back it up oh but this is a word revival what does the word produce the word the word opening never ever produces dead theology of just some nice mental understanding and putting quotes together and isn't that lovely no a word revival brings jesus on the scene that's a real word revival when jesus steps down i mean into his word and makes it live that's a word revival hallelujah amen that is a real revival that is a word of ah well we're in the we're in the eagle age yeah god doesn't take away he adds so the lutherans they were the just shall live by faith have we thrown that away then the method has come along sanctification living a holy life dressing right acting right speaking right you know all those things do we do we still do that do we still have a clothesline religion yeah we have a hole in it yeah we believe in holiness don't we we don't strip ourselves off and walk naked on the street no we live we believe in holiness amen so we still believe in but we believe in being justified by faith that we not it's not our works that any man should boast we are justified by our faith in the lord jesus christ so we believe in this we believe in holiness but then why do some people want to skip the restoration of the gifts and say but we have the word now brother no no no no god adds he restores if you're going to restore back you take what has been that's fallen down and rebuild it what did elijah do mount karmas is and he rebuilt the altar of the lord the altar of the lord was already there but it had fallen down it had to be restored here to take stones i say revelations of the word place them correctly then the sacrifice could go on then the fire could fall same thing with you and i you know revelation stones are placed in our lives repent that's a revelation be baptized in lord jesus christ the revelation give your whole life you know water baptism the seals all different things revelation but then you're gonna come to a place where's the sacrifice and god says you've got to present yourself a living sacrifice you've got to give yourself to this word that's what you got to do and so that's how the fire falls is not when you have a bunch of revelation stones without a sacrifice on it no you've got to climb on the wood you've got to present your whole life and then the fire falls hallelujah and what went on the altar doesn't stay there anymore because the fire comes down and burns it up it's the same thing with our carnal nature it doesn't stay it gets burnt up hallelujah amen i believe in maybe i've always been a pyromanic i don't know maybe i realize i just am right i love fire fire consumes fire cleanses fire burns up and i'm talking about holy fire hallelujah but people are against people are against this kind of thing and they say well that's very straightforward because we have that which is perfect now let's just let's just speak about that first corinthians 13 the apostle paul would say in verse nine four we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child and then i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as i has known even as i am known and now and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity so he's saying that we know in part we prophesy in part but that when that which is purpose has come that in part shall be done away now what is the bit that's done away just the partial it goes to full right because a child understands partially speaks partially you know when they're about between two and three they just get real bent up frustration because they can't even get out a sentence but then they go from that i trust to a fully mature adult and they can actually articulate how they feel or what they want to convey so they could speak in part they could do in part when they become fully grown they do in the fullness you don't take away basic language when you become an adult you don't throw it away do you you know i still say i'm happy i said that when i was maybe this big but people have it in their mind oh that which is done in part is the gifts and we don't need that anymore because we're not children no it's all part of the body that's why brother brown people would challenge him saying you're trying to return the people back to an apostolic faith you know that's done away with that was with the apostles and he would just say god put it in the body god put it in the word show me where god took it out and then people go to questions and answers 1964 and they'd say for first corinthians 13 says when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by god's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication but notice he says and so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues we don't try and talk in tongues we let god talk in tongues through us i mean we don't jump up and down like kids because we have a full understanding we're redeemed right we can know we can no more die than god can die we're eternal as god is eternal my sins are being washed in the blood of calvary i am a free born son of god i'm going in a rapture hallelujah so i'm not just jumping like a kid i know her who i am i know i've been washing the blood of the lamb and that allows me to jump because i have a full i've got a theophany body hallelujah that if this this heart stops beating it's already there waiting for me i've heard from that theophany that's why this message came my way god's telling me child you've got a theophany you're going to step into hallelujah so i'm not just jumping like a kid because everyone else is doing because it's fun i can jump with understanding hallelujah see but then the dead baptists of the message want to take this and say well we just do away with that kind of thing no they're misplacing the word oh we've matured no people mistake maturity for actually drying up and dying god help us i've very much put myself in that boat that i don't dry up and die oh i'm mature now i'm stable in my walk no no hold on instability is very different to being happy in emotional and heartfelt religion so we still have the gifts of the spirit and quite frankly i pray it happens more oh but it might not be the right spirit why are we so afraid of the devil who are we giving who are we opening ourselves to you've got to be very conscious lord if it's you speak if it's not don't speak or however he wants to minister because not all of us speak in tongues not all of us prophesy not all of us interpret it's in the body right but some people are so afraid oh people are afraid of wildfire i'd rather have some fire than no fire and but i'm but i'm qualifying that as i want the fire of god right people say well it's just a bunch of steam coming out the whistle well it's good to have it's good to have steam come out the whistle because that means there's a fire burning in the engine it's not just a cold swept out oven with nothing in it no there's fuel in there there's fire hallelujah i'd rather have that because eventually eventually it will actually go into motion but i'd rather just have a whole bunch of steam going out the whistle at first hallelujah you understand what i mean but people are all what about this what no we shouldn't be afraid of who cares what the pentecostal move has done with the gifts that shouldn't even be our it shouldn't come into our equation right are we are we all in agreement nobody said scarecrow scare crows right brother braham said where he was planting butter beans and he tried to make a little scarecrow to scare was a gopher or a groundhog i think it was a groundhog so he drew a little monster thing on a bit of paper and put it on the thing he said boy that was scary if you could see how i draw now but there was a hunger in this groundhog for butter beans so when he came out of his hole he saw the scarecrow he was a bit intimidated by it but he watched it and moved with the wind he kind of backed off but he came looked again because he's got a hunger see he's got a hunger he had a hunger for the reality of those butter beans he wasn't interested in just looking at the butter beans from afar he wanted to taste them not to fill his belly hardly there god have a good snooze afterwards they meant to he had a hunger so he looks at this thing and it moves but you know then he kind of taps it it rattles he jumps off taps it again rattle rattle he realizes that thing can't hurt him he just runs around it starts feeding his belly full of the reality of what he wanted shouldn't that be the same thing with us in the spirit of god hallelujah sure there's a bunch of scarecrows around but there should be a hunger lord i want to see you live in a greater way i want to see the realities of god i mean all that you are i want to see manifested in my life hallelujah i don't i don't want to just be so bound up and trying to no we're trying to be too human we should let go and let god have his way hallelujah amen amen it's just a mockery of the real holy ghost but remember there's got to be a genuine before there can be a counterfeit right counterfeits to never come before the genuine right so if there's a mockery there's a genuine somewhere amen and brother bam says why would you want to take a substitute when the skies are full of the pentecostal blessing so you can say right above us is the fullness of all that god is all the blessings are there why take a substitute of just adopting a creed you know there's a lot of creeds in the message right there's a lot of creeds of just rattling off quotes and i believe and you know it's like it's like the apostles creed i believe william branham was the prophet of god for this hour malachi 4 to fulfill this and this and this they can just become like the apostles creed just saying something it's not it's not that it's but that's trying to substitute a new birth because people brother and sisters are afraid of a new birth they're trying to substitute with handshaking church joining but it's none of those things it's when you really meet god and brother braham says that the only kind the only kind the work can bring forth is the same that it did in the book of acts blabbering crying hooping snotting shouting a bunch of people acting like a bunch of drunks that's the kind of the word brought forth first and that's the only kind that the people want acts 238 tongue speaking shouting yangons around her but a lot of people say well that would certainly embarrass me no that would do me real proud hallelujah that'll do me real proud amen yes she don't want any whooping crying screaming hallelujah amen why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination they had one like that and one of the churches why they'd throw her out right quick why are you lending such stuff as that going along see you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming holland blabyrin acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council you can't she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind the word can bring forth born of the spirit it has a spirit of god in it no intellectual church join a creed going bob head paint face there's no such a thing and all of that you don't find it in the word of god you find an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god that's from the invisible union of the bride 1965 should you worry about such a detail so we have been restored yeah and people say well we don't want to be anointed well you look at the scripture you know the anointing is for the wheat right the anointing is for the wheat it's not for the tears but people look at the tears and see what they do and they say oh we don't want that kind of thing no we have to be anointed there are or what about false anointed ones false christs in the last day matthew 24 there shall be false christs in the last day christ means anointed one but everyone is an anointed one in the last day it depends if you're true or you're false the same holy ghost falls on both remember but then the world is anointed too right brother ram says that the speaking of the you know elvis presley pat bernie says those that kind of music released from those judases of this hour will take the world to the battle of armageddon why because there's a spirit on that music that will take the world there what they're anointed the world is anointed what about the bride of christ we should be the anointed one of the last day right filled with the spirit of god so don't worry about what the tears do or what these ones do who cares no the anointing is for me the anointing is for the bride hallelujah so we should get in the spirit hallelujah and not just in church but every day we should get in the spirit and help us you know but every morning what should we do when we get up get in the spirit commit our ways to the lord praise him give him glory walk on with god hallelujah i believe we should do that help us now to do it amen so now why are you saying all this i'm saying all this because we have a god of reality and we shouldn't settle for second best of just going through emotion you know our children deserve to see god move and they actually deserve to be anointed with the holy ghost i would love it we tell the girls actually we'd love to see them shout and scream under the anointing hallelujah that make me real happy i meant to see them run the olds and scream and say you're real god you're real are you real for me not for someone else but for me isn't that what we want amen the people say god you're real jesus you're alive i love you my parents have told me the pastors told me but now i know you're real for me hallelujah and this is what this message is to do i mean to show god is alive again and a people hallelujah because he's not here to rap check books and bibles he's here to rapture people with the holy ghost in them hallelujah hallelujah amen but what are we going to do just get in the spirit amen he is here amen that we can get in the spirit hallelujah not to go through a form you know what david said to his wife he says if you don't like today you just watch me tomorrow because i'm gonna dance worse harley i'm gonna embarrass you more earlier why but it was that out of a pure heart it wasn't done out of spite because he loved the lord more than anything else and god help us that we love him more than anything else amen that we worship god because of who he is he is altogether lovely he is all together wonderful amen he's redeemed us amen you think about we don't have to go to hell we don't have to go into the tribulation now go study world war ii history that's an amateur tribulation go look at it you don't have to go there you don't have to go there you can bypass it and go in a rapture and then also we don't have to stand before the white throne judgment we don't have to go there you don't have to go there today you can bypass it go on a rapture and actually judge the world with jesus christ he that believeth in me amen shall not come to condemnation but has passed from death to life they'll not come to the not come to the judgment and that's a bright scripture amen have a real revelation of who he is hallelujah so to me he is altogether lovely can we have the musicians please this morning amen but it's the most important thing get in the spirit and stay in the spirit hallelujah amen let's stand this morning amen so i want to encourage you if you've just received a new spirit but you're slipping back into old ways and old habits and old things come get the holy ghost and he'll give you power to overcome all those things amen [Music] amen i want to sing that song
