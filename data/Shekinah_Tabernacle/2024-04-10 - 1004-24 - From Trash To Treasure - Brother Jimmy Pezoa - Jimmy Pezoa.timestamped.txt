[32:45] your calling Brethren how that not many
[32:48] wise men after the flesh not many mighty
[32:51] not many noble are called but God had
[32:54] chosen the foolish things of the world
[32:57] to confound the wise and God had chosen
[33:00] the weak things of the world to confound
[33:02] the things which are Mighty and base
[33:04] thing of the world and things which are
[33:06] despised have God
[33:09] chosen chosen ye and things which are
[33:12] not to bring to not things that are that
[33:15] no flesh should glory in his presence

[33:24] righteousness and sanctification and
[33:27] Redemption that according at is written
[33:30] he that glor let him glory in the Lord
[33:34] amen amen may the Lord bless his word
[33:36] you may have you
[33:38] it
[33:40] amen the Lord put this thought in my
[33:44] heart and I wanted to speak about this
[33:47] from
[33:48] Trash to Treasure amen hallelujah and
[33:51] that's something that only God can do
[33:54] take a piece of
[33:56] ravish and make it something something
[33:59] beautiful
[34:01] am amen AMJ I have here an
[34:07] example who's this
[34:10] boy King David
[34:13] amen the Bible says
[34:15] that okay just let's go the Bible says
[34:20] that Samuel the prophet he was the Lord
[34:23] talked to him and said to him now go to
[34:25] the house of Jessi
[34:28] because there is a king in that
[34:30] house and what Jessi
[34:35] did he sent the king with a sheep yeah
[34:40] why because for the human it's just so
[34:44] easy to judge the book by the
[34:49] cover and I can can imagine the
[34:52] preparation in that house man the
[34:54] prophet of God is coming to this house I
[34:58] can imagine the the big brother getting
[35:01] dressed hey Daddy do I look like a king
[35:05] yes you look like a can brother
[35:08] impo if that would be your case would
[35:12] have you sent FY
[35:15] away good of
[35:17] you I trust that wouldn't be the case
[35:21] what about ID what if you sent Daniel
[35:26] away
[35:30] okay this story has a happy ending but
[35:34] in that house it was a preparation cuz
[35:36] someone was going to be anointed to
[35:39] become a King Jesus
[35:41] Hallelujah but David he was there with
[35:45] the lamb said I can't just imagine that
[35:47] sad story saying hey Daddy am I not
[35:50] going to stay here no no no no you you
[35:53] go away you go with your ship wow man w
[36:00] why because I think the Lord was working
[36:04] in David's life David David was a very
[36:07] humble
[36:08] man but in order to do that he he had to
[36:12] have like a different path in his
[36:16] life amen
[36:19] now David he was always playing his
[36:22] heart and I had a little bit of that uh
[36:26] country life when I was um doing daily
[36:28] farming when you take your Lambs or cows
[36:31] or whatever to feed that's all what you
[36:34] do because they just have to eat but
[36:36] what do you do you just have to wait so
[36:39] I can see David just playing his H for
[36:44] hours and throwing stones with his
[36:49] slingshot now those two hobbies that
[36:52] were going to be really important for
[36:54] the Kingdom of
[36:55] Israel yes sir the king he was going to
[36:58] be like how do you say tormented by a
[37:02] bad spirit and he needed a man that
[37:05] could be able to play the harp but not
[37:07] just play the harp Saul said a man that
[37:11] can play very well the harp that was
[37:14] David amen hours and hours playing his
[37:18] instrument the Lord preparing him yeah
[37:21] true and then we all know the story
[37:23] about the harp I mean like about the
[37:25] stone yeah he was very very good Throne
[37:28] stones that
[37:30] boy but also he had to take care of his
[37:34] um sheep and I can see him one day just
[37:38] counting them saying Oh yeah Dorothy
[37:43] Peter Sean where's sea and there's sea
[37:47] with a lion and he killed the lion
[37:51] another day Dorothy Peter Sean with the
[37:56] bear and he kill the
[37:59] bear that character that was getting
[38:01] formed in David
[38:04] man but now when the prophet of God went
[38:08] to his house and went to anointed the uh
[38:11] older brother God said to him but the
[38:14] Lord said unto Samuel look not on his
[38:17] countenance or on the height of his
[38:19] statue because I have refuse him for the
[38:23] Lord seeth not as a as a man seeth for
[38:26] men lookth
[38:27] on the outward appearance but the Lord
[38:30] lookth on the heart what was on the
[38:33] heart of
[38:36] David I'm going to get to that soon amen
[38:39] the key now we have David he was not
[38:43] scared yeah David got anointed by a
[38:47] prophet that told him you are going to
[38:49] be a king amen so now David when he went
[38:53] he didn't go to work he were just to
[38:55] drop a pel but he got in involve there
[38:59] why why he was so brave David has a
[39:03] secret weapon amen he had Revelation
[39:06] from a prophet said you are going to be
[39:08] a king you cannot die amen so this boy
[39:13] if I cannot die I'm going to go and
[39:14] fight amen amen and I'm pretty sure that
[39:17] if we believe the word of God that was
[39:20] spoke through a prophet we can say that
[39:22] we are an invincible
[39:24] Army
[39:26] amen and the story that doesn't finish
[39:29] there you know that David he actually
[39:31] cut the head off the giant yes it wasn't
[39:34] just
[39:36] Stone but the story of David keeps
[39:40] telling us that he was a very humble
[39:42] man even when Soul tried to kill
[39:46] him once
[39:48] twice hips of times he was not going to
[39:52] do anything against Soul because the
[39:55] spirit of the Lord came to David when he
[39:57] was anointed as a king and he couldn't
[40:00] see that the problem was not
[40:02] Soul we are not fighting against flesh
[40:06] we're fighting against spirits and that
[40:09] was the noble things about David that he
[40:12] was not angry with
[40:15] soul he could have killed him he didn't
[40:19] he had the promise of a um Prophet
[40:23] saying you are going to be a king but he
[40:25] didn't took his sword and went to the
[40:28] palace and said now I'm the king he was
[40:30] very humble even when Saul got killed
[40:35] what that's amazing David said to that
[40:37] guy something like how dare you to kill
[40:40] the anointed man of
[40:42] God for David Soul
[40:45] always was something that he respect yes
[40:50] amen now we can
[40:53] see David this is David with um my said
[40:57] how do you how do you say that in
[40:59] English my
[41:02] was this guy was son of Jonathan his
[41:05] friend son of um
[41:08] Soul now in the caral round what would
[41:13] would you do if the son of your
[41:17] enemy is in trouble he could have just
[41:20] killed him I'm going to get rid of your
[41:22] lineage this is it your grandfather was
[41:25] so mean to me on and I'm going to kill
[41:28] you now boy but the heart of David was
[41:33] beautiful and said and David said unto
[41:35] him fear not for I will surely show the
[41:39] kindness of Jonathan thy father's sake
[41:41] and I will restore the all the land of
[41:43] Soul thy father and thou shalt eat bread
[41:45] at my table continually and he bowed
[41:48] down and said what is thy servant that

[46:10] mercy on whom I will have mercy and I
[46:13] will have compassion on whom I will have
[46:16] compassion so then it is not of him that
[46:20] willth nor of him that
[46:22] runneth but of God that showeth Mercy
[46:26] for the scripture sayith unto Pharaoh
[46:29] even for this same purpose I have raised

[47:11] don't you feel blessed that the Lord of
[47:13] Mercy chose
[47:16] you
[47:18] amen I have no idea for how long I've
[47:20] been here probably not even for 10
[47:22] minutes but I want to show um tell you a
[47:25] little testimony about my life
[47:28] that's an emergency room in a hospital
[47:31] there was
[47:33] um um one week after I came here my
[47:36] friend invite me to like a PP or
[47:38] something and I went out with them and I
[47:41] drunk and I got high on drugs and
[47:45] whatever and they all left they went to
[47:49] their house or whatever and I was just
[47:51] there
[47:53] alone I could have gone to my house but
[47:56] go going to my parents house minute that
[47:58] I was going to receive a Le pxa oh
[48:02] boy because my parents would not allowed
[48:06] that behavior in their
[48:07] house so I start to think and I said
[48:11] where can I go I went to that emergency
[48:14] room in a hospital cuz it was a like a
[48:17] heat pump or something and I went
[48:21] there and I I think it was like 3:00 in
[48:23] the morning I just wanted to sleep
[48:30] and some homeless people that's are
[48:32] arriving to that place that was a place
[48:35] where the homeless people go to
[48:39] sleep
[48:40] and from one moment to another one I was
[48:43] surrounded just by homeless
[48:45] people and something spoke to my heart
[48:48] and said to me if you don't stop now
[48:51] this is how you going to end up wow
[48:54] wow the Lord already here
[48:57] an appointment with me that plane he was
[49:00] going to have an appointment with me and
[49:02] I'm so happy amen that he had that
[49:05] appointment amen I didn't do anything
[49:07] and I don't deserve to be here but he
[49:10] chose me am and I know that the Lord
[49:13] have chosen you
[49:15] too but in order to receive that we have
[49:19] to really know that we don't deserve
[49:22] anything he just showing his Mercy amen
[49:26] hallelujah
[49:27] and now I can say that the lord gave me
[49:29] a wife give me a beautiful daughter a
[49:33] little handsome little man
[49:36] Hallelujah and man the Monday night I
[49:39] was there with um the youth having the
[49:41] prayer
[49:43] meeting my house was parked with
[49:46] Christian
[49:47] Believers and man like eight or nine
[49:50] years ago I was just surrounded by drug
[49:55] addict people people that drank
[49:57] alcohol and I was like man what a
[50:01] difference you have made in my life Lord
[50:04] hallelujah and probably this is just
[50:06] very personal but I'm happy to share
[50:08] this with you
[50:10] because with who else I can share these
[50:12] things I'm just a very happy person cuz
[50:15] the Lord have changed my life amen and I
[50:19] know that if you are going through
[50:21] something the Lord he can change
[50:23] everything amen cuz you are a vessel
[50:25] that the Lord want to p All His
[50:27] blessings in you doesn't matter what's
[50:31] happening for me to get to this stage
[50:33] that I'm now there was many many years
[50:36] for my parents of praying yeah of
[50:40] praying and they saw like every year I
[50:42] was getting worse and worse and worse
[50:46] and worse but one day man it was just
[50:49] from one day to another day the Lord
[50:51] just changed my life
[50:53] Hallelujah and in order to don't judge a
[50:58] book by its cover I have another
[51:00] testimony that and I'm sorry Pedro but
[51:04] Pedro when he got the revelation of the
[51:06] message he tried to talk to my parents
[51:08] about this he talked to my mom he talked
[51:11] to my dad he talked to my other brother
[51:14] why he didn't share it with me because I
[51:17] was too
[51:19] lost that was that's what the eye the
[51:23] human eye can
[51:25] see but from that family I was the very
[51:28] next one in receive the message wow
[51:30] praise God and receive this Revelation
[51:33] I'm hoping that my family is going to
[51:34] come here and they're going to get the
[51:37] Revelation too of the Lord Jesus
[51:40] Christ but that's what happen when you
[51:43] judge a book by its
[51:45] cover and like we know that we need to
[51:49] find the last one but the last one
[51:51] probably doesn't even look like a
[51:53] Christian person it can be an emergency
[51:56] room like a homeless person it can be
[51:59] like the worst of the worst but the Lord
[52:04] he can take some trash and make it into
[52:07] a treasure amen well that's all what I
