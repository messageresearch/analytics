[24:18] here for a long
[24:21] time but it's really good wonderful to
[24:24] be here um and uh let's just go into the
[24:27] word it's okay Malachi chapter
[24:31] 4 and we'll read those famous well-known
[24:36] scriptures and if you could hold uh
[24:40] Philippians uh chapter 3 as
[24:47] well Malachi 4 we'll just read verse 5
[24:50] and 6 it says
[24:51] behold um I will send you Elijah the
[24:57] prophet amen before the coming of the
[25:00] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[25:04] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[25:08] to the children and the Heart of the
[25:11] children to their fathers lest I come
[25:14] and smite the Earth with a
[25:17] curse about you but I grew up cutting my
[25:20] teeth on that
[25:23] scriptures uh Philippians chapter
[25:26] 3 um
[25:28] uh chapter
[25:30] 3 um and I think it's verse verse 13 it
[25:34] says here
[25:35] Brethren um I count not myself to have
[25:39] apprehended but this one thing I
[25:43] doy Lord and and and sometimes we find
[25:45] this to be a struggle forgetting those
[25:48] things which are
[25:50] behind and reaching forth unto those
[25:54] things which are before I press
[25:58] towards the mark of the price of the
[26:01] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and
[26:05] that I believe should be the mindset of
[26:07] us as Believers but now verse 15 says
[26:11] let us there uh therefore as many um as
[26:16] be perfect be thus
[26:19] minded but it goes on it says and if in
[26:24] anything you be otherwise minded
[26:28] God shall reveal even this unto you and
[26:33] I read that scripture by I see the grace
[26:37] of God for me that hey you might not see
[26:41] it now amen you might not understand it
[26:44] now but God is going to come and he
[26:47] going to reveal his word to me and to
[26:51] you me just one last scripture um first
[26:55] Thessalonians 4 and then we'll take our
[26:59] seats um four uh we we'll read verse 15
[27:03] 4 verse1 15 for this we say unto you by
[27:07] the word of the Lord that we which are
[27:10] alive and remain unto the coming of the
[27:12] Lord shall not prevent them which are
[27:15] asleep for the Lord himself shall
[27:18] descend from heaven with a shout and
[27:20] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[27:22] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[27:25] shall rise first then we which are alive
[27:29] and remain shall be caught up together
[27:32] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[27:36] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[27:40] the Lord wherefore Comfort one another
[27:45] with these
[27:47] words so be comforted tonight Hallelujah
[27:50] with these words amen we are getting out
[27:53] of this place let's just pray Lord your
[27:56] word has been read and we just want want
[27:57] to ask that you have the preeminence in
[28:00] Jesus name amen and amen God bless you
[28:03] you may be seated tonight uh in the
[28:05] presence of God and I know it's it's a
[28:07] Wednesday night and I always struggle to
[28:10] try to keep my time so I will really
[28:12] really try to keep my time uh this
[28:15] evening but um you know how it is as as
[28:20] a as as a
[28:21] Christian um you know the the the Lord
[28:24] is is is really is a he's is's a one
[28:27] wonderful father he's he's a God that
[28:31] that cares he's a God that that loves us
[28:34] and even though you know we find
[28:36] ourselves going through I don't know
[28:38] about you right I think it was um at at
[28:40] the camp and really awesome Camp brother
[28:43] Ben and awesome Camp Believers man and
[28:47] you know when when whenever brother Ben
[28:49] sends out the invitation was ask him I'm
[28:52] the first one the
[28:54] registers always the first one registers
[28:58] and I always look forward to those
[28:59] meetings but um you know someone
[29:01] actually mentioned at the camp and they
[29:02] said you know uh man I don't know about
[29:05] you but 2023 has been a tough year and
[29:08] you know I I I I look at that and and
[29:11] and I I I look back at at at you know
[29:13] the things that has happened and and
[29:15] it's been hard it's it's been tough but
[29:18] at the same time it's it's just it's
[29:20] been glorious and and and you know and
[29:24] you see as the Lord has been whatever
[29:26] the Lord is allowed to happen in our
[29:28] lives we can see growth and we have to
[29:32] see
[29:33] growth and so so so this evening I just
[29:36] want to just start off with this brother
[29:38] branam would say in the in in the
[29:40] Rapture message he says he says there's
[29:43] too much
[29:45] Supernatural
[29:47] Vindication of God's written word of
[29:50] this hour for something not to be
[29:55] approaching us now I believe that we we
[29:58] are we are living in exciting times and
[30:02] he says he goes and he says it's to real
[30:06] he says it would be Astound he's telling
[30:09] the people it would be astounding to you
[30:12] just to let you know what is really
[30:16] taking place and you know when I read
[30:19] that and then and I say you know there
[30:20] are things that's taking place and and
[30:23] and and I'm not I'm not talking about
[30:25] the things happening in Israel those
[30:27] things has got to happen you know
[30:29] there's things happening all around us
[30:32] but you know when I read that I say Lord
[30:35] there are things that's taking place in
[30:39] your people there's things that's taking
[30:42] place in Te and I see it happening and I
[30:47] am grateful when I read this word I see
[30:51] myself in the word am and I am thankful
[30:54] for that he says many of you strangers
[30:57] you perhaps hear these men get up and
[31:00] and make these remarks about and he puts
[31:02] in quotes here a message of this hour
[31:05] and so forth what they are getting at is
[31:10] God's promise of this hour that he
[31:15] promised what he would do and we see him
[31:22] scripturally
[31:23] vindicating just exactly what he said he
[31:28] who do and that's why I say I see myself
[31:34] in this word I read the word and I see
[31:37] the word says this needs to happen that
[31:40] needs to happen and I see it I see it in
[31:42] my life all right and I'm grateful for
[31:44] that you know when when when you deal
[31:46] with Believers and you speak to them you
[31:48] can see what God is doing man and then
[31:51] and you you realize that that that that
[31:53] he's taking you and he's you you are me
[31:55] and you we are evidence brother actually
[31:58] brandom uses the word we are evidence of
[32:02] his
[32:03] victory so you know when we go out there
[32:05] and we live life and a lot of times as I
[32:08] was as I was coming to to church tonight
[32:10] and I was sitting on the train and and I
[32:12] was thinking a lot of times many times
[32:15] we we look at our lives and and we
[32:17] forget many times that we are we are
[32:21] proof of his victory cuz many times we
[32:25] look at our mistakes many times we look
[32:28] at the things that has happened in our
[32:30] lives and we we fall we slip but we tend
[32:34] to forget that in that time maybe in
[32:37] that time period we focus on the
[32:39] negative but many times we need to just
[32:42] look back and say hey yeah I overcame
[32:46] yeah I said no to the devil yeah I did
[32:49] something
[32:50] positive and I seen what God has done in
[32:53] my life come on now so so so so I just
[32:57] want to encourage you this this evening
[32:59] that you are proof of his victory so
[33:04] that when you walking down the street
[33:06] and you might be feeling down and out
[33:09] you are proving that God is God you are
[33:15] proving that there is nothing that's
[33:19] impossible to
[33:22] you you know what and and and as a you
[33:25] know as as as you know I was saying we
[33:28] we we go through things in life man we
[33:30] we we go through struggles at times and
[33:34] uh you know first also I thought to
[33:36] myself I wanted to say thank you um to
[33:39] you as Believers because you know
[33:42] especially the season that my family
[33:45] went through with my sister the sickness
[33:49] and her passing and you realize that you
[33:52] know what when you going through stuff
[33:55] that when people reach out that we are a
[33:59] family and I want to say thank you for
[34:02] that but I want also just drop in you
[34:04] know that um when when when all of that
[34:06] happened and we were praying and praying
[34:08] and praying and the Lord decided to take
[34:11] my sister and then you know there were
[34:14] obviously many questions that came from
[34:16] different people and then the Lord took
[34:18] me to a court and I want to read it
[34:20] tonight because you know many times we
[34:23] we we we we we pray for certain things
[34:25] and we say Lord I need this to happen
[34:28] now or want that to happen or want that
[34:30] to happen and sometimes it doesn't
[34:32] happen or it doesn't happen the way we
[34:35] want it to happen brother brandom who
[34:38] tell us about a a mother and you
[34:40] probably know about this you talk about
[34:42] a mother that had a daughter that was
[34:45] sick and how she they they were praying
[34:48] for this child and I think but the
[34:50] brandom also um you know he he said
[34:52] certain things to them and your child
[34:54] will be healed but eventually the
[34:56] daughter died
[34:57] and the mother came and and she was so
[35:00] despondent because she believed and she
[35:03] had faith that God was going to do the
[35:06] impossible but then she came to brother
[35:09] brandham and the Lord eventually
[35:10] revealed to brother brandham you know
[35:12] really what happened but then she comes
[35:14] to him and she says brother Brandon why
[35:16] did my daughter die or or you know why
[35:20] did this happen in my life why I prayed
[35:23] and I'm praying and I'm praying but it
[35:26] just didn't happened he says so she says
[35:30] is it because my faith is
[35:33] weak is it my weakness of faith and
[35:35] brother Bram says I told her that you
[35:39] have great faith and obviously she
[35:42] didn't understand what he meant by that
[35:44] and he said you prayed for your
[35:47] baby and your husband and you held on to
[35:52] that but God still decided to take the
[35:56] baby he refused to do it because
[35:59] obviously he knows what's best but
[36:02] brother Bram drops in he says even
[36:05] though God said
[36:07] no you know how it is many times in life
[36:11] every time we pray for something we want
[36:14] God to say yes that is just life right
[36:18] we want every answer we wanted to be yes
[36:22] we never want to know from God but
[36:25] sometimes God has got to say I know and
[36:28] many times we don't understand it at the
[36:32] time but then by and by we understand
[36:37] and man I have been there so many times
[36:40] and I today I say father thank
[36:43] you that you said
[36:46] no because if you had if I had to push
[36:49] that way where would I have
[36:51] been so so BR he talks about this woman
[36:54] and he tells he says um
[36:57] um uh he says um even after God took
[37:04] your child he says he knows what's best
[37:09] and still you love him am so even though
[37:15] God said
[37:17] no she still loved him and I read that
[37:22] and brother B says that's real Faith
[37:26] amen
[37:28] even when he says
[37:30] no even when he says no and it's still
[37:35] hard I still love
[37:39] him and you know what I can say this of
[37:43] a personal
[37:45] experience and you know what you've been
[37:48] part of that Journey when God had to
[37:51] tell T and his family
[37:55] no I am taking her but then after he
[38:00] took her did T to love the Lord
[38:04] hallelujah and I can stand here today
[38:06] and say yes brother Andy even so much
[38:12] more I want to serve him I want to just
[38:17] give him my everything yes Lord
[38:20] hallelujah because he's done so much for
[38:24] me I cannot tell it all
[38:29] brother Brandon would would come here
[38:31] and he will just you know just just just
[38:33] talking about how much we need him you
[38:39] know we and I said we we go through
[38:41] things he says no but he wants us to
[38:43] serve him he wants us to honor him he
[38:47] wants us just to give our everything he
[38:51] says yeah he says um he prays a prayer
[38:54] he says um David said he would come into
[38:57] the congregation of the Saints and make
[38:59] his request known and he says tonight
[39:03] there has been many hands perhaps maybe
[39:05] I would say 80% of those that are
[39:08] sitting in the building tonight they
[39:10] raise their hands for
[39:12] request it shows Lord and he's praying
[39:16] that we can't go without you you know
[39:20] that is the testimony of test doesn't
[39:24] matter where I go go I acknowledge and I
[39:29] know that I need him you know in my home
[39:32] we've instituted this hold say it's a
[39:35] rule but doesn't matter where we go my
[39:38] my children does it as well when they're
[39:40] going to school when they going to the
[39:42] shop whether I'm going to go buy milk we
[39:45] I stand there in front of my door and I
[39:48] pray and I say father I'm going down the
[39:51] road I need
[39:52] you and I think that should be our our
[39:55] attitude he says we've got to have you
[39:59] day by day you are our life our joy our
[40:04] health he says our sustaining strength
[40:08] our stay our buckler our shield from the
[40:14] enemy that's who he is to you but like
[40:18] David says I've got to put the lord
[40:22] always before me amen
[40:27] yes that's
[40:29] right he says and we just could not
[40:32] fight this battle of life without
[40:37] you I
[40:39] I I know that I am preaching to the
[40:42] choir because I know that you agree with
[40:46] me that we can't do without him am every
[40:50] single minute of Our Lives we need Jesus
[40:56] amen amen hallelujah that's
[40:59] right and I'm thankful for that I am
[41:03] grateful I am
[41:05] grateful now I was I I read I I I read
[41:08] those those those those
[41:11] scriptures um this
[41:14] evening uh because the Lord's been
[41:16] dealing with me you know how it is
[41:20] we we we we we go through
[41:23] life and we um you know we experien so
[41:27] many things um I I preached I think I'm
[41:30] not sure where it was I was talking
[41:33] about how many times life just
[41:37] overwhelms us and and David David would
[41:40] say Lord when my heart is
[41:44] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[41:48] higher than I and many times we find
[41:51] that that you know there's so many
[41:54] things that puts us so under under
[41:57] pressure that many times we
[42:01] forget why we are
[42:04] here many times we we we we so
[42:08] focused on the
[42:11] situation we're so focused on the
[42:15] problem so focused on Lord I need this
[42:18] Lord I I need you to help me out of this
[42:21] situation
[42:23] and many times we are so focused focused
[42:26] on that that we really sometimes
[42:29] forget why are we here
[42:32] right and brother Bram would talk he'll
[42:35] say in in the second coming of the Lord
[42:37] he you talk about this woman that had 10
[42:40] pieces of silver right and she'd lose
[42:43] one and she'll do a house cleaning and
[42:45] to find it and once she finds it she'll
[42:48] know you know she'll throw a party and
[42:49] say come and rejoice with me now brother
[42:51] brandom uses that scripture in the
[42:53] second coming of the Lord sermon now he
[42:55] said is this he says now that may seem
[42:59] like a very odd scripture for the second
[43:03] coming of Christ he says but it is
[43:07] speaking of the second coming of Christ
[43:10] but what I want to get at is he says
[43:11] this he says and this great
[43:16] subject that we have here before us now
[43:21] he says one of the most vital subjects
[43:26] in the entire holy R he says there's
[43:31] nothing so important he says as the
[43:36] coming of the Lord and that is why we
[43:40] are here brother kuben we need to hear
[43:44] from him because we need to get into a
[43:49] condition to get out of this place and
[43:52] this precious revealed all open word
[43:57] amen has come my
[44:00] way and it's showing me
[44:03] how to get into the right condition to
[44:08] get out of this place he says there's
[44:10] nothing so
[44:13] important as the coming of the
[44:16] Lord for if he does not
[44:20] come we have been found to be false
[44:25] Witnesses
[44:26] and as I look at you you are definitely
[44:29] not a false witness you are a true
[44:32] witness and you are a you are his
[44:36] victory he says he says and if it if he
[44:40] doesn't come our dead that's in the
[44:44] grave are
[44:46] perished and there is no hope left for
[44:51] us if Jesus doesn't come visibly the
[44:56] second
[44:57] time and I think many times it's so
[45:00] important to be
[45:03] reminded yes sir that Jesus is coming
[45:08] yes and yes we go through life and we
[45:12] experience things and this word is
[45:15] changing us but it's getting us into a
[45:19] condition and we mustn't ever lose focus
[45:24] with the fact that we are getting out of
[45:28] this
[45:29] place soon and very soon I'm going to
[45:33] see
[45:34] Jesus then he goes on here and things
[45:37] that ought to be he says I'm thankful
[45:39] for these open doors that I've had and
[45:41] he says and and and inspiration is GI to
[45:44] to young men he says like your pastor
[45:47] year he says um I'm beginning to get old
[45:50] it said he says now uh he says that that
[45:52] these young men can take this message
[45:56] and sweep it on to the coming of the
[45:59] Lord if he doesn't come in my generation
[46:02] and then brother Bram says which I'm
[46:05] hoping to see he says I look daily for
[46:10] him and that was in
[46:13] 1960
[46:15] 1965 he says I look daily for him and
[46:20] brother as I read that I asked myself
[46:23] the question T when you get up in the
[46:26] morning is that your focus are you
[46:29] looking and under expectation for
[46:33] him he says he says here I look daily
[46:38] for him keeping myself prepared for that
[46:45] hour and that's what the word is doing
[46:49] and that's why it's so important to
[46:51] receive whenever we hear the word we
[46:54] need to receive receive it he says we
[46:58] should he said now he goes on he says we
[47:01] should know how to tell the people to
[47:06] prepare for this great event that's
[47:10] coming that's right it's important and
[47:12] and and what I like is that he he makes
[47:14] these statements right but all the
[47:17] answers is in the revealed word it's all
[47:22] there telling us and showing us how to
[47:26] get into that condition to be raptured
[47:30] you know who talk about that that great
[47:33] magnet that would come across the you
[47:35] know in the warehouse and you would say
[47:38] as the magnet goes he says things get
[47:40] attracted to that magnets but there are
[47:43] certain things that's not attracted to
[47:45] the magnet and he asks the question and
[47:47] he says the things that's attracted is
[47:50] of the right
[47:52] material and that is the kind of
[47:54] material
[47:56] that is
[47:57] magnetized to that
[48:00] magnet and this word is transforming us
[48:06] for that great magnet when it comes man
[48:10] he says he says uh we should now to tell
[48:14] the people to prepare he says if the
[48:17] coming of the Lord is so great it's the
[48:21] most
[48:23] essential thing that we
[48:26] can do is to get the people prepared for
[48:33] it and then he goes further because
[48:37] sometimes people would say now what must
[48:38] I do how can you get prepared he says
[48:41] now in end time evangelism he says now
[48:45] we're going to end right here by saying
[48:49] this he says the end time
[48:54] message is to get the bride
[48:59] ready and prepared for the Rapture
[49:04] that's right now when I think when I
[49:07] read about the end time
[49:10] message I don't think of books and tapes
[49:13] and all those things that I grew up with
[49:16] but I see the word the revealed word as
[49:21] the message to you and to me brother
[49:24] bandam would say it can't be anything
[49:25] outside of this book so it's all in here
[49:30] power packed and I am grateful that I am
[49:34] part of that I am part of the move of
[49:39] God I I see it in my life Hallelujah the
[49:43] Lord because this message is a
[49:46] supernatural message and you know that
[49:49] right we experience it you know we are a
[49:52] supernatural people we deal with the
[49:54] supernatural
[49:56] we dwell in the Supernatural so he'll go
[49:59] on he'll say testimony upon the sea and
[50:01] he'll give a testimony and you'll talk
[50:04] about that day when he was baptizing his
[50:06] 17th person and you'll say he says you
[50:09] know the Canadian newspaper packed it
[50:12] about 31 years ago across the whole
[50:15] province of Canada he says and the
[50:18] heading was a Mystic light appears over
[50:22] a minister while baptizing in the river
[50:26] now we know the event there right and he
[50:28] says that was in 1930 at the you'll say
[50:31] where it was he says as I was baptizing
[50:35] my 17th person I said heavenly father
[50:40] and I was a young Baptist preacher I
[50:41] said heavenly father I can only baptize
[50:44] him with water unto the fellowship of
[50:46] this church but I pray that you'll
[50:50] baptize him with the Holy Spirit and I
[50:53] said that and he says then something
[50:56] said look
[50:57] up I heard it a third time it said look
[51:02] up he says and I turned and I looked and
[51:07] a great Roar shook around over the crowd
[51:11] and he says and here comes that Light
[51:14] Milling itself down and stood right over
[51:20] me where I was standing he says and a
[51:23] voice came from it and said said as John
[51:26] the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[51:30] first coming of Christ your message will

[56:57] in the message we've been hearing these
[56:59] it's all in the Bible yeah it's all
[57:03] there we just say Lord as as I'm reading
[57:07] your word can you please just open up my
[57:12] understanding Lord give me
[57:16] Revelation you know Peter what did Jesus
[57:19] say that flesh and blood has not
[57:22] revealed this to you Peter my Father in
[57:27] heaven and Upon This Rock of Revelation
[57:31] I'll bow my church and the house of Hell
[57:35] cannot Prevail against it amen so we say
[57:39] father if I don't understand if I don't
[57:42] have Revelation don't you know what I
[57:44] want to just drop this in you might have
[57:47] heard me say it before I'm going to say
[57:48] it again if there's anyone here today
[57:50] right you're sitting here and and and
[57:52] and and and sometimes the ministers
[57:53] preach by the B preach and we have an
[57:55] Andy preaches and and and we don't
[57:57] understand what they saying and then we
[57:59] walk out and we sometimes we and I've
[58:01] been there we belittle ourselves we
[58:04] think it's like it I wish I knew those
[58:06] things I I want to I want to I want to
[58:08] ask you don't ever try to belittle
[58:12] yourself because no man can show you
[58:16] what's really in the word it takes God
[58:20] and God Alone amen so if you struggle
[58:24] Ling with something that's in the word
[58:27] and you hear the ministers talk about it
[58:29] you read it I can't see it you say Lord
[58:33] you reveal it to me amen and you know
[58:37] what might happen the minister might
[58:39] just say something that will just man
[58:42] you find something just snaps you and
[58:45] then you say wow it's always been
[58:50] there I won't forget one day many years
[58:53] ago was probably 12 I was about 18 and I
[58:56] remember I I was sitting in a fellowship
[58:58] with Brothers but I was sitting around
[59:00] the corner there and they were
[59:02] fellowshipping and they were arguing and
[59:03] going crazy and I sat there and there
[59:05] was something that I was struggling with
[59:07] I didn't understand and then somehow one
[59:09] brother just said something and when he
[59:12] said something about the word somehow I
[59:15] caught it and man it was like bells or
[59:19] like light just went open and I said wow
[59:23] I didn't see it like that I didn't know
[59:26] I've always heard the brothers talk
[59:27] about it i' heard this brother say this
[59:30] but then God had to come and reveal it
[59:34] to me
[59:37] personally and this
[59:39] message it's a message of adoption amen
[59:42] it's a message of
[59:45] perfection be what does Jesus say be he
[59:50] therefore
[59:52] perfect and this word is showing you and
[59:56] me how to reach the Perfection this is a
[1:00:00] message of the body change which is in
[1:00:03] the word and this message is getting us
[1:00:08] ready for the
[1:00:10] Rapture to get out of this place oh
[1:00:15] thank you Lord oh yes am and many times
[1:00:18] I say Lord come Lord Jesus when I look
[1:00:22] at what's happening around me but then
[1:00:24] also I I told the church told the church
[1:00:28] on Sunday I said you know what um I like
[1:00:32] to know what's happening around me and
[1:00:34] what I used to do then was I would
[1:00:36] subscribe to YouTube
[1:00:39] channels like you know Ben Shapiro and
[1:00:42] uh what's it what's it guy um Jordan
[1:00:44] Peterson and you know all this Fox News
[1:00:46] stuff and I used to subscribe to it so
[1:00:50] what used to happen was whenever new
[1:00:52] content gets added a popup comes and man
[1:00:55] the the clickbait that sounds so
[1:00:57] interesting I want to watch it and what
[1:00:59] I found was that I started to be so
[1:01:05] consumed with what they were saying and
[1:01:09] I started to neglect the real things I
[1:01:12] need to be looking
[1:01:14] into and so the Lord then started to
[1:01:17] deal with me and what I did was that I
[1:01:20] then unsubscribed
[1:01:23] myself from all from Ben Shapiro from
[1:01:26] Jordan Peterson and all these other guys
[1:01:29] I they said n n i I will not choose when
[1:01:32] I want to listen to them if I want to
[1:01:33] but yeah is my source of Truth and I'm
[1:01:37] grateful for
[1:01:40] that you see this this message this
[1:01:44] message it provides us
[1:01:47] opportunities yeah to
[1:01:50] experience God in a real way I'm you
[1:01:55] know I I stand here today and you know I
[1:01:58] I'm I'm I'm I'm a testimony today of the
[1:02:01] grace of God I see him doing things in
[1:02:05] my life and you know it's like I always
[1:02:07] think of David how you know David he um
[1:02:10] he had the bear and he had the lion
[1:02:12] eventually he first Goliath and I see I
[1:02:14] see how the Lord you know he takes you
[1:02:16] he gives you this trial and you overcome
[1:02:18] and gives you that trial and when you
[1:02:20] sometimes you get faced like right now
[1:02:22] you know I'm facing something that looks
[1:02:24] so
[1:02:25] big but at the end of the day God is
[1:02:28] teaching and he has taught me he says T
[1:02:30] don't look at the
[1:02:33] problem he says focus on the Promises of
[1:02:38] God all things are possible
[1:02:43] hallelujah hallelujah and use the
[1:02:46] opportunities that this word is giving
[1:02:50] you and
[1:02:51] me and I I I'll close up with this
[1:02:57] shortly you see because this this this
[1:02:59] and these these are things that I I
[1:03:01] believe we know but this this
[1:03:05] word it's teaching
[1:03:07] us who God Is
[1:03:10] Right it it shows us truly in the word
[1:03:15] who God really
[1:03:18] is also it shows us who the devil is
[1:03:21] right so we know and and and the reason
[1:03:23] it shows us so that we can recognize the
[1:03:26] devil brother Brandon would come and say
[1:03:28] you know what um to overcome is to
[1:03:33] recognize the devil in his tricks so
[1:03:36] this word is showing us who the devil is
[1:03:38] that's right but at the same time this
[1:03:40] word is showing you and me who you are
[1:03:43] Michel that you are not some downtrodden
[1:03:46] something but that you are a son of God
[1:03:49] you a daughter of God and that there's
[1:03:52] no devil in hell amen that can walk over
[1:03:56] you
[1:03:57] Hallelujah he might try and he will boo
[1:04:00] at you and he will try to make you think
[1:04:02] you
[1:04:06] nothing but don't don't give in Amen to
[1:04:10] the enemy Hallelujah when he says boo at
[1:04:13] you you say boo
[1:04:19] back so you know we we we we need to
[1:04:23] make use
[1:04:25] of what this message is presenting to us
[1:04:30] now I'll read I just got two quotes here
[1:04:32] he he he says here in the presence of
[1:04:36] God um
[1:04:38] unrecognized he says now when he is not
[1:04:45] recognized his power is always not
[1:04:50] revealed so you when he not when you
[1:04:53] don't don't recognize that he's here in
[1:04:56] a sense you know you don't realize that
[1:04:59] he's he's here to help you you don't
[1:05:02] seese the
[1:05:03] opportunity to reach out and say father
[1:05:06] I need
[1:05:08] you so he says now no
[1:05:11] matter how much God Is Standing
[1:05:17] present you've got to believe
[1:05:23] it so it's important that you and I we
[1:05:28] need to believe that God can that's
[1:05:32] right so now he says like the woman with
[1:05:35] the blood
[1:05:37] issue all of them passing by and all of
[1:05:41] them standing up saying there goes the
[1:05:45] rabbi that that's the guy that claims to
[1:05:48] be a Prophet this is the fanatic and all
[1:05:51] such as that but what happened happen he
[1:05:54] says this little
[1:05:57] woman had an issue of
[1:06:01] blood and she had heard about
[1:06:05] him and when she come down there
[1:06:09] regardless of what anybody said she
[1:06:16] recognized who he
[1:06:20] was very important that we need to
[1:06:25] recognize that we are in the presence of
[1:06:28] almighty God his word says right there
[1:06:32] where two or three are gathered together
[1:06:36] in my name there am I in the midst of
[1:06:40] them so he's
[1:06:43] here recognize
[1:06:46] him she said if I can only touch His
[1:06:51] Garment and when that genuine faith in
[1:06:56] God became a positive thing to her cuz
[1:07:01] she realized and she
[1:07:03] recognized that my healing is
[1:07:08] there it's a positive thing yeah what
[1:07:12] did it release to her he says it
[1:07:16] released his power to heal
[1:07:21] her but she had to do her
[1:07:25] part she had to
[1:07:28] recognize that it was
[1:07:31] him amen she had to recognize who he was
[1:07:35] it released his power to heal her it
[1:07:40] touched him in such a way that he turned
[1:07:43] around obviously said who touched me and
[1:07:45] then he spoke to her and said your faith
[1:07:48] has made you whole others standing there
[1:07:52] might have been sicker than she was but
[1:07:56] you see she recognized his
[1:08:02] presence she knew that was her
[1:08:09] opportunity before I go to the next
[1:08:11] quote I want to drop in this uh
[1:08:14] testimony my wife I didn't if I did
[1:08:19] mention it yeah it's okay you'll hear it
[1:08:21] again my wife um I think it was it was
[1:08:24] round about uh
[1:08:27] 2018 my wife
[1:08:29] was um wasn't
[1:08:32] well she was there was a problem with
[1:08:36] her and the Lord worked things out that
[1:08:40] uh we had a 2018
[1:08:42] convention uh said brother Andrew Glover
[1:08:44] came and and and and there was a prayer
[1:08:47] line and um my wife she came through the
[1:08:52] prayer line and she says Lord this is my
[1:08:57] problem and father I I I recognize that
[1:09:01] I am in the presence of almighty God and
[1:09:04] Lord I am walking through this prayer
[1:09:07] line because I want to receive
[1:09:10] healing this was in
[1:09:12] December and she goes through the prayer
[1:09:15] line and as she came past I think I was
[1:09:18] standing at the end and she came past
[1:09:21] and then as she moved past us she
[1:09:24] collapsed on the
[1:09:26] ground and then you know they prayed
[1:09:28] with her and things like that and then
[1:09:31] life went on and we went back
[1:09:35] December um she went back home she was
[1:09:38] still sick she was still showing
[1:09:42] symptoms but my wife
[1:09:46] believed uh
[1:09:48] January
[1:09:50] February
[1:09:51] March my wife was still not well but she
[1:09:59] believed because she says the Lord told
[1:10:03] me to go in that prayer line and yes I
[1:10:06] might be seeing the symptoms but God has
[1:10:10] healed
[1:10:12] me February and March and April and May
[1:10:18] and June and July and August my wife was
[1:10:23] still showing symptoms but she
[1:10:28] believed and in
[1:10:30] September God honored that faith and
[1:10:34] then one she said Taz the symptoms is
[1:10:40] gone so it makes me think of you know
[1:10:43] what the Brandon would say you know when
[1:10:44] the when the the lights went off one day
[1:10:46] in the room and and and and and the
[1:10:49] little girl screamed and the her brother
[1:10:51] said don't worry there's a man here
[1:10:54] that can turn on the light right but
[1:10:56] brother Brandon would make a statement
[1:10:58] and say yes there's a manual that can
[1:11:00] turn on the light but he's just holding
[1:11:03] for a while to see what you're going to
[1:11:05] do so I want to encourage you with that
[1:11:08] testimony that you know what we're
[1:11:10] praying for certain things and and and
[1:11:13] we we trust in God and we know that God
[1:11:15] is able to do certain things and if God
[1:11:17] says yes it is yes God says no he's
[1:11:21] going to have to help us to accept the
[1:11:23] no
[1:11:24] but if he says yes it's yes and it's
[1:11:27] going to happen he just wants you to
[1:11:31] trust himall only trust
[1:11:35] him musicians can come and I'll just
[1:11:38] read you this last quote here you know
[1:11:40] just back to the you know this the
[1:11:43] opportunities that he provides to
[1:11:51] us so brother Bram yeah would
[1:11:54] talk about this
[1:11:57] woman
[1:11:59] that was washing his
[1:12:03] feet and he says
[1:12:07] here talking about
[1:12:12] Jesus he says then he turns to
[1:12:17] her I can just
[1:12:19] imagine seeing her standing there
[1:12:24] and her big pretty eyes all stained up
[1:12:29] and her face where she had grease and
[1:12:31] the dust of the road on her face and she
[1:12:33] thinks now have I done wrong have I done
[1:12:37] wrong and Jesus says unto her he
[1:12:41] says her sins which are many are all
[1:12:46] forgiven go in peace and brother Bram
[1:12:49] talks about that that
[1:12:51] scene and then he says now what was it
[1:12:56] what really happened
[1:12:58] there he says
[1:13:00] she
[1:13:03] recognized she
[1:13:06] recognized her
[1:13:10] opportunity and many times God
[1:13:14] presents opportunities to
[1:13:18] us but because sometimes we are so
[1:13:22] focused on
[1:13:23] my problem and this thing and that thing
[1:13:27] that we don't
[1:13:30] recognize the
[1:13:32] opportunity that he has presented to us
[1:13:36] right here in our face where the brandom
[1:13:40] says she
[1:13:43] recognized her
[1:13:47] opportunity
[1:13:49] she did him a
[1:13:52] service
[1:13:54] the Pharisees didn't do
[1:13:56] it she saw it and she
[1:14:01] recognized his
[1:14:03] presence and brother bandam says what
[1:14:07] did it do so the fact that she comes in
[1:14:11] there she sees our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:15] with dirty
[1:14:17] feet and an
[1:14:19] opportunity is presented to her
[1:14:24] and she recognizes the
[1:14:27] opportunity she recognizes
[1:14:30] him and she recognizes that she needs to
[1:14:35] do him a
[1:14:37] service but the B says you know so she
[1:14:40] washed his
[1:14:41] feet and then she brother Bram says now
[1:14:45] what did it release to
[1:14:49] her she recognized his presence she
[1:14:54] recognized that she needed to do him a
[1:14:57] service she realized she recognized that
[1:15:00] she needed to worship Him brother Bram
[1:15:05] says what did that release to her he
[1:15:10] says it released
[1:15:13] forgiveness he says and that was what
[1:15:16] she
[1:15:17] needed so she recognized his presence
[1:15:21] she recognized the fact fact that she
[1:15:24] needed to worship
[1:15:27] him and that because of that it released
[1:15:33] to her
[1:15:35] forgiveness of her
[1:15:39] sins and he goes on what did it also
[1:15:44] do it also released the power of God to
[1:15:49] show to them unbelievers that he was a
[1:15:52] prophet
[1:15:53] Propet he knowed who she was and just
[1:15:58] that act of
[1:16:01] worship that act of
[1:16:04] recognizing him now he's not here
[1:16:07] physically right and that we can go and
[1:16:09] wash his feet but brother brandham would
[1:16:12] say we worship him when we worship Him
[1:16:16] and we just give him all the honor the
[1:16:20] praise the glory we wash him his feet
[1:16:24] and he says now it to her as well in
[1:16:29] addition to
[1:16:30] forgiveness it released to her
[1:16:34] joy and power and eternal
[1:16:39] life so the the the the for me when I
[1:16:42] read that the the the the
[1:16:45] power of recognizing the
[1:16:50] opportunities that he presents to you
[1:16:52] and me
[1:16:53] and even you know
[1:16:55] Believers every single Gathering don't
[1:16:59] don't just brush it
[1:17:01] aside because God speaks to individuals
[1:17:05] Hallelujah and he deals with this one
[1:17:08] this way he deals with that one that way
[1:17:11] but he presents
[1:17:13] opportunities and he wants us just to
[1:17:17] let go and just worship Him amen just
[1:17:22] give him yes I all
[1:17:26] recognize his
[1:17:28] presence let's just pray you can just
