going to bless us with a song Amen so you can have your seats Hallelujah in the presence of the Lord this morning amen praise the Lord God bless you all this morning and I just I had a rush of inspiration last night so amen um it actually the song that is about Hezekiah and usually when you go through situations if you write a song about it then it uh the song has a bit more meaning to it than just a song you'd sing and right um so the background to this little song just to to make it interesting for you um when we were going through the trial a couple months ago that what we spoke about here the Lord sent seems to sometimes just give you when you're going through these things he might give you a character in The Bible and say well just look what happened to him look what he did and look what happened to him and look at his outcome and if you do the same thing you'll have the same outcome so um in that situation that we went through with a with with the companies the the character that I got was Hezekiah and Hezekiah served the Lord and he he he served them with all his heart and he tore down the the idols and those things and then not long after that the enemy moved in you know you think he's doing everything right and then the enemy comes in and um there was a very strong enemy that came against some of the Assyrians and Hezekiah basically went to the Lord and sought the Lord and desired deliverance from the Lord in that situation but you see when the syrians came they not only attacked him but they attacked the people on the walls they said don't trust in Hezekiah what's he how's he going to deliver you he's just deceiving you you know sometimes in our lives we get tested on all angles you know and anyway I just I just was blessed by the story of Hezekiah and how that Hezekiah just trusted in the Lord and the Lord delivered Hezekiah so can you brother um amand I've got I put the song up on the um slide if you just typ in Hezekiah you should find it and I hope I get this one right cuz I only just really wrote it last night but I want to just read you out the words to it in light of that there once it comes up on this one I just want to read these out just to get the feeling of it um the Assyrians gathered around Hezekiah looked out over the walls and all he saw as far as the eye could see was a sea of men when The Messengers approached him he gave to them a ransom but they said you have no more strength for war your Council won't help you anymore and all your people on the walls hear what the great king says don't let Hezekiah deceive you and say God will deliver us this day just look at every place we've been every Kingdom we've fought has been trodden under our feet you will be the same as the railings came up from the Assyrians Hezekiah went down to his knees he raised his hands and bowed his head and said oh God today is a day of trouble oh God the child has come and there is no strength to bring forth but you're all my strength you're all my deliverance and I put my trust in you oh God Amen oh God I have learned that in every situation whatever I'm facing I put my trust in Jesus and he won't put me to shame go tell Hezekiah his prayer has been heard behold I send Isaiah with they thus saith the Lord and to the king of Assyria I say who is thou blasphemed against was it not to the Holy One of Israel you may have spoke to Hezekiah but he put his trust in me the words you spake against him M ears they they have received but I'll hear no more the way you came is the way you'll go there won't be one Shield against the city there won't be one Arrow there will be no embankment made against it at all thus saith the Lord you will turn and you will go thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord I have learned that in every situation whatever I'm facing I put my trust in Jesus and he won't put me to shame so we'll try we'll try and do it folks I may get it wrong I've only learned it last night so is this [Music] going the Assyrians gathered round Hezekiah looked out over the walls and all he saw as far as the eye could see was a sea of men when The Messengers approached him gave to them a ransom but they said you no more strength for war your Council won't help you anymore and all you people on the walls hear what the great king says don't let HEI deceive you and say God will deliver us this day just look at every place we've been every Kingdom we fought has been trotten under our feet you will be the same and as the railings came up from the Assyrians hezeki went down to his knees he raised his hands and bowed his his oh God today is a day of trouble oh God the child is come and there is no strength to bring forth you're all my strength and you're all my deliverance and I put my trust in you oh God oh God I have learn thing in every situation whatever I I am fac I put my trust in Jesus he won't put me to shame I have learned that in every situation whatever I am face I

this service may it be done in in your wonderful name and the name of Lord Jesus Christ we commit all these things into your hands amen amen amen thank you musicians amen amen God bless you amen it's good to see everyone out this morning uh just before we just before you take your Bibles um I don't know if everyone realizes but we have a printer in the front room and a lot of the lot of the sermons of brother baram are not actually printed by voice of God the vast majority have never been in print but we can print them so I know everyone has a tablet or a mobile phone they can read it electronically but if there's a if there's a sermon you want to read you know print it out we can do it for you here we have everything available so so I printed off some your testimony Jesus Christ 53 lamb and 56 and healing what cancer is in 53 I don't know if these have ever been in print before maybe they have I don't know but they're all available so just thought i' let you know remember there's the uh books there uh in the room and we're replenishing them as you take them but but that's only 62 to 65 are printed there you know so there's many other years are not printed so if you wish to uh yeah if you want any sermon title or I want to know about some topic we can find it in this message and print the sermons off for you if you like them in that form amen let's um let's go to Leviticus chapter 25 and I just want to um I I I heard a I heard a service of of of brother Brandon this week and it really uh uh really I'd say uh really spoke to me as most of them do but this one really just jumped out and I want to uh let just read some scripture here before we actually um before I go into it so so Leviticus we're just going to read three three verses Leviticus 25: 8 to 8 to 10 and he says here and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 49 years then Thou shalt cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seven month seventh month in the day of atonement shall he make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and ye shall H hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land and to all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family amen may the Lord bless his word you may you may be seated so you know we're living in a very significant time uh in in the world's history and you know um I don't really uh I don't really want to preach a sermon as such uh but I just trust that don't think I'm we off into something just just just just stay with me now I really pray that the word of God that we have received would mean a lot more to us than it ever has at this Vero I pray I pray this message that we have received means a lot more after this service to us now those that those that keep track of dates we understand that 50 years ago brother bam was preaching his you know one of his last series of services in shreport and then on the 12th of December was the last time he was ever preached the service and that was just in communion and he just gives a few comments and then after that's done then he you know you drives heads back to Jeffersonville he's in the accident and he's gone before Christmas so this this is significant because every 50 years is a jubilee and we are 50 years down the road from you know you know just in less than 2 weeks is the 12th of December it's 50 years and it's all done and this is important because I just want to go into these things because we must recognize Jesus said no man knows the day but then he in that same chapter of Matthew 24 he l and conditions when you see it like a days of Noah days of lot so shall it be you know he speaks of these things so there's Junctions there's very important Junctions in a in in a Church's walk or or in an age and we' have come to that Junction we've come to a time where things what we've enjoyed in the past you know we can't always have Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after Wednesday Thursday after Thursday and all and just have Christmas the next year have another Christmas and just life can't just go on it can't just continue on as it has you know it just can't we're at the end of all things and so we've come to a point where the world has changed and you and God God's word is still the same but how he's dealing what he's doing among people is very different to the seasons before and you can see that you know you could see you know the short few years that I've been a Believer and you just see the atmosphere in the conventions you know what we experience up in car Cary what we had in our little Camp what was there in Queen's birthday was not the same was a totally different atmosphere to what it has been in the past the same people were there well more people were there now than they were but the same people have been there the whole time they've all been Believers but there's there's a change there's a change in the atmosphere amen you feel a Divine love that was not there amen amen over all the people as it was in the time past so this is we have to be spiritually aware that there's a reason this is happening amen there's a there's a reason why these things are going on and so you know I don't want to get ahead of myself but brother bam tells a story and I and I'll go into he speaks of he speaks of you know ducks that migrate you know there in North America there from Louisiana they go up to Canada they laid their eggs and then the change and the change of the Season those ducks that have been born there never been off the pond but because the change of the season they begin to swarm and there's a head Drake raises up he begins to honk and then he flies off they all follow him straight to Louisiana so in the change of the Season there's a gathering he uses these simple stories but this is this is where we are there's a there's been a change in the season we're not we're not 50 years ago at the opening of the seals we've come 50 years down the road and so what happened 50 years ago happened for a reason in that season but now we're in a different season the word is still the same but it's he's revealed himself in a greater way and so as he's been walking with us Church it doesn't matter if we've been walking with him for 5 seconds or for 50 years I'm sure you can recognize things are changing because remember the sign of the end the Great sign of the end is not the world's Condition it's the bride's condition yes because when she knows what she is then the Rapture will go when she recognizes her true position in Christ then the Rapture is going to go so when you really want to see where you know we understand Israel is God's time piece they've been in the land first time in 2,000 odd years they've been a nation you know they've been like that since 1948 so that's the time piece but then our Redemption is linked with their Redemption and you can see that in the Book of Ruth where Ruth came to her position a moabitas who had no part of the promise of God became United with Boaz who was a Kinsman who was who was Christ and type and then she she received her Redemption and then that her her coming into her position of Union with Boaz was tied into Naomi being redeemed as well so our our Redemption and Israel's Redemption is linked and so now and and so what I'm saying is now Israel is waiting those 144,000 I believe they're there they're waiting for us to leave and when we leave they'll receive what we have and we understand that you know brother Tony Emma brought it out in the in the ministers meetings you know Ruth you know had the child had the child and then gave the child to Naomi so You' say an infant gospel was was given back to the elect Jews there you know so the same Christ that we have they receive it in a you say in an infant kind of way and then they and then in Revelations 11 it's called two witnesses to Israel because they uh they they preach the same thing that we have that's why they called Witnesses and so the two our us coming to our position we have to come to our position and then once we are taken out of the way then they receive now there's an overlap time I don't know how exactly that all comes together but we're in that overlap time because Israel you know the you know the first the first Jewish leaders there of Israel they were secular but now they've become more religious you there's a national stirring up of the Jewish people why is that because they are getting prepared there's a ground swell come back to the word because they are getting ready they're being prepared to receive this same Jesus Christ that we know Hallelujah and so these things are linked together so we need to look at now we need to look at where we are and I trust at the end of the service you'll look at where we are very differently cuz I know probably most Sundays I say the rapture's on and we're living in the season of the resurrection and we are but where where are we in that season are we in the beginning or at the end of that season I and I trust you know we're at the end of that season so now he says so this is just brother bam he says and and when he this is part of his comments when he when he just speaks before the communion there and uh you know to on the last recorded you the last piece that God has that voice in the days of the voice of the seventh angel you know so that voice this last part of what's recorded he speaks this he says now there's one thing I'd want to say just before we start the communion is this that I believe that we' have seen enough in our day that we live in that we ought to really give every all of our being to God we should really serve God I believe he has blessed us with a direct answer to scripture and he has as brother Perry gave it a few moments ago that we're at that time we're not blind we see we see that we're here we've arrived and we also can look around and see that the way that the human mind is leaving the people that we can't stay too much longer we'd be in a complete insane institution the whole the whole world would be SE so at the end time now as brother Perry ended up there seeing these things are true see if they are true they're not myth they're not just something that we imagine there's something that's been directly given to us by the word of God and manifested publicly before us that we know we are here and we have no don't put that 50 years ago bring that to today cuz we have a direct answer where the same God that was there is the same God that present and the same God that affected people and Drew them there has drawn us as well so we have the same one now brother brandom yeah because I was I was cuz a lot of people have made uh you know on the internet's 50 years since this and 50 years since that and I just kind of left it there but then when I heard when I heard the Ser sermon uh return and Jubilee this is the service I heard it really spoke to me and and that's where the opening text is from and and I'm going to speak from that sermon but you know 50 years so brother bham he he he spoke at the 50-year Jubilee that was in California 1956 he he spoke at the isua street Jubilee where they had the 50th year anniversary and then in 19 I believe it's 61 or 62 where he spoke um see if I can find the date uh 62 1962 was the 50th year Jubilee of when the Holy Ghost fell in Louisiana and now he makes he makes something of this because he is he is looking at where the church is in its condition and he says so we've come 50 years now remember every 50 years is a jubilee so there's a there's a season comes into being where the people can go free back to their inheritance or they can stay bound they have a choice there's a there's a specific season that comes remember the 49 sabbaths before the 50th there wasn't a jubilee trumpet and the people were bound and they were stuck in their way someone could go redeem them and pay and we'll come into that but they were they were stuck but then when the Jubilee trumpet sounded every man had to go free every born every born Israelite their god-given right was they had to go free and they had to go to their position they had to it was law and it was enforced so it wasn't just a suggestion now you may it's you must go free it was a law it was God's commandment and so he comes to this 50th year anniversary and he's seeing that the that the church has has has left its foundation the church has left its foundation from being led by the Holy Ghost and God living to now they formed an organization and they just turned it into a tradition and now he says this in the world falling apart in 63 he says this he says as long as it's a system it's a system the whole system's rotten and get away from the thing that's exactly what we've got to do before it ever comes back you might not believe that but this is taped listen as it was a few years from today if there is such and you'll know whether it's true or not one day when the evening lights are breaking it's too late then you'll say well that man could have been right but it's too late then just exactly what Jesus said when he come to the Earth he said God had sent them prophets down through the age every time their world system would fall apart their religious system said what did you do with him God sent the prophet and put him in a tomb that's exactly and then about another generation you wake up and realize that that was a prophet and then what do you do you garnish the tomb what do you do make a tradition of his life you see the the the the Next Generation looks back because you say well how do you garnish a CH tomb today you make a tradition of his life you just make a tradition out of Christianity I bring it on home even more you just make a tradition and that is garnishing the tomb amen he said the Next Generation always does it and you can go you know Luther was there God was present the just shall lived by faith the people came out of the Catholic church and the light that was given and then and then Luther dies they turn it into a tradition and then some other people raise up and they come out and it's just a cycle all the way down through you see you see All Through the Ages God raises up people raises up men amen and they don't want to start a new church they want to fix the one they're in but because the church there in has made a tradition out of this is what we do and this is how we worship and this is what we believe then they have to leave it they don't want to they want to fix it but they have to leave it and then that person found something cuz they have to found a church for people to gather to and then he dies and they make a tradition out of his life and then the cycle continues to repeat friends we are people like they were people he say well we're the bride of Christ the ones that came out in that age with a bride of Christ too amen and where the people failed is they turned what they believed into a tradition amen if you turn this message into a tradition you've denominated amen because I can be a denom you see well this is non- denominational church you can be a denomination in yourself amen birds of a feather flock together that's right you see So eventually they'll all flock together now now with this church now we're free but if you've denominated in your heart you just put God In The Box put a full stop at the end and this is my experience and this is just how it is then you have done what they've done and we can turn we can turn coming here every Sunday into a tradition we can you know if if the Lord should car 10 years and we have a camp every year and we have watch Night Service every new year and maybe we'll have some other special meetings and we have a you know maybe you know our Queens birthday is our anniversary maybe if we had you know Lord willing when we go upstairs we have room to invite more people so we can get a guest speaker and you know these things that can turn into a tradition oh W Camp was wonderful I'm looking forward to the next oh that was wonderful you know just it just turns into a tradition what are you doing this this long weekend well I go to Camp why we always go to camp on this long weekend it turns into a tradition amen and because we're 50 years down now I'm just painting the picture this way because this is what the church every 50 years this is what this is what Pentecost sh did yeah had the prophet he standing there saying you got to get back he says return return to your jubile it's the time of Jubilee return to the Holy Ghost return to the true power of God return to what your forefathers had and then there's a brother there's an older brother there that was at isusa Street and he gave the testimony and there before you know you just go listen to that sermon 1962 return in Jubilee and then this old brother gets up and you can hear him on tape and and before it's recorded he says to brother B off the microphone You Preach to zeusa Street exactly and then he gets up and you can hear it in his voice says we must return we must return this you know our movement has got into the what do he say the Machinery of men and you can you can almost hear the tears fall off his face he's burdened cuz he sees he sees what the prophet's talking about amen see here's a burden we must return cuz now is the season of Jubilee and friends you may think you you may be free I'm not saying we're all you know what I'm saying is we're in a season of Jubilee we're in a season where every Blood Bought son and daughter of God has a right to return to their inheritance we're in that season this is a season of Jubilee where we have a right you say well I don't know what my inheritance is look and look into the inheritance look what into what belongs to you amen because I believe we should never Plateau on our experience with God don't get comfortable in your walk say Lord I want more of you even Paul said I want to apprehend that which has apprehended me that's what the messenger said of the first church age how much more now us down at the end of all things where we believe that in a twinkling of an eye we're going to step into a next Dimension into a new body hallelujah amen doesn't mean you have to get saved all over again I'm not talking about that at all I say don't plateau don't be satisfied amen say Lord I want more of you because there's more of God always to have ien you say well I think I know it all when you know it all there's one thing you should know you're wrong that's what the prophet taught us if you think well I've got all the doctrine sorted out I know how the Bible fits together you're wrong cuz this is an eternal word amen it's it's not it's not just well I've read it once and now I know it all it's an eternal word so read it again you meditate God you're the author I want to talk to you amen we serve a living God Amen now it's got a Deuteronomy chapter 6 I just want to read a few things you know I don't know if I have the quote here but but in that service because they were under great persecution there in Louisiana when the when the Holy Ghost fell and people ran them from all kinds of places they said they're having a meeting in one place people are shooting through the windows trying to kill them he said there was an old sister on the floor and the Holy Ghost praising God she got hit by a bullet it just fell off her dress like nothing happened amen that's right amen that same God Amen see that's the problem we have we are actually cursed with too much that's right we are cursed in this country with too much you say it's first world yeah sure but we're cursed it's a curse that's right and I'll show you this here Deuteronomy chapter 6 and I could say this even too we can access any Ministry want we want we can find the best preachers in this message and we can listen to it day after day I now don't take me wrong but that can be a curse amen because you just sit there and you listen and you listen and you listen but where's the outworking where's the prayer we're seeking God for yourself you know brother Braham he said he said the Pentecostal Church chur are like modern day Hawks remember the eagle yeah we're called to be Eagles a hawk is built like an eagle but it can't fly it Can't Fly Like an Eagle and he said the modern day Hawks here in America they sit there on the telephone wires they wait for some roadkill and then they go and eat that they go and eat that off the road and he said they have lost their first estate they have fallen instead of hunting food for themselves they just wait there for something to die and then they go eat it that's right amen I know this may come across strong but that's what he said he said that that is what the church has has become Hallelujah now I believe in listening to Ministry if you take it in the right Spirit then you'll be spiritually blessed if you take it in the right spirit I believe it I do it myself amen but if that is all you do then you're just waiting for something that someone else has grabbed that's instead of seeking The unsearchable Riches of Christ yourself amen sure there's Ministry to break down the word and all these things but we're called this is not a Catholic Church Catholic Church is the priest has everything and then and then the priest dictates what he's going to tell the people this is not a Catholic Church I reject that in the name of Jesus Christ we're not called to just wait for the minister to tell us what we need to know we should and then when we've been reading it then he preaches it then God brings it together he say now I understand amen so that's what we need to do amen seek it out read it amen listen to it absorb it Deuteronomy chapter 6 now sorry we'll start from verse three he says here therefore o Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee that ye may increase mightily as the Lord God of thy fathers has promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey hereo Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shall love the Lord wait am I on the right chapter yep Deuteronomy 6 and thou shal love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might and these words which I commanded thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently to unto thy children and thou shalt talk of them and thou when thou sest in thy house and when thou walst by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up you say well I don't know a whole bunch just tell what you know amen if all you know that you know God tell them about that amen tell them that you met Jesus Christ Hallelujah you that's you know that's right when thou rise up Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be as frontless between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy Gates and it shall be when the Lord thy God uh Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swear unto thy fathers to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildest not and houses full of all good good things which thou fillest not and Wells digged which thou diggest not Vineyards and olive trees which thou plest not when thou shalt have eaten and be full then beware least thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage Thou shalt fear the lord thy God and serve him and thou shalt swear by his name so he's saying now he's saying because I in the wilderness they had to depend upon God all they had was manner that fell they they had nothing else they had the smitten Rock that's all they had but then now when they come into a place and he says there they didn't build the houses they didn't plant The Vineyards they just received it it was already there for them they just walked into their inheritance he says now beware that when life is easy you you forget God that's right and they'll say you know and then you can see in Malachi you know Malachi they say you know you know God is God is laying a you know complaint against Israel you know you say you you know you know you have robbed me he says you robed me in tithes and offerings and they would have said what do you mean we love we haven't robbed God we love God we're is you know you we're Israelite Believers yes but they they had they had forgotten amen because life got easy life got oh now the church is nice and now we have nice music and now we have nice singing and and now we have Sunday school all nice and the church lunches are all good and now Camp is all good and you know everything's nice but where Le th forget the Lord amen that when you have too much he saying when you have it all laid out beware least you forget the god that delivered you amen and that is exactly that is exactly now what what the prophet was telling the people there the 50th year Jubilee there of of Pentecost falling he says he didn't use the scripture he's basically saying the same thing you know you have left off you have got you have left your inheritance which is the Holy Ghost leading you and now you have a system set up you know that maybe appears good and to man's logic they like to have a hierarchy of men and they like things all documented and written up and all these things that's what men likes but if you if you lean that way and it's not God's provided way then you've left your Foundation you've left your inheritance and you're being led by man instead of God so now this and so he's calling the people back to their inheritance now remember we're 50 years down the road from from when the men you you when the messenger was here when the prophet messenger was here and you see the church now because we're a couple of generations down the road just like Israel was amen we the first the first generation they possessed the land they saw the power of God and there's only a few Generations down the road where it just became a tradition and they you know and we don't want to we don't want to be caught in that kind of cycle amen we don't want to be caught in that kind of cycle we understand that the cycle breaker has come Jesus Christ himself has come to break us out of that cycle of Revival and death he has done that but it's but man can still slip back back into that cycle it depends what you want now this is in uh return and Jubilee now we find out that so many of us in these last days in our organ organization of Pentecost that we have come in and organized ourself and rejected the leadership of the Holy Ghost by the wisdom of some groups of people instead of having Fellowship one with another it's divided us and separated us into several different organizations of people and in doing so it has broke up our inheritance now these walls inside if you ever get walled into a place where you can't accept the word and the Holy Spirit and have to take the Creeds and so forth of a church instead of the power of the Holy Spirit the Jubilee will never mean nothing to that person no matter how much uh you can say mother left uh uh you can say mother left you your inheritance daddy did that but you sold out and walled up and come into a Creed and accepted this Dogma that was injected into your fellowship instead of being free in Christ and getting and letting the Holy Spirit lead us along back in uh in the age when the early church was getting itself together immediately they had to go organizing and when they did because they were afraid now listen they were afraid that somebody else would a leader would get into a little group they had issues that come in and when they had to organize these issues and if they had just let it alone let the Holy Spirit weed out and bring out and lead in and put in the church would have been farther advanced than it is now in spiritual power yes now a man and his family could go back to their original inheritance if they could hear the Jubilee a trumpet sound and know that what what it meant to them now if they heard the priest sound the trumpet the minister the trumpet is the gospel and when they heard it and they know what it means and they know that that's their inheritance no matter where they've uh uh where they had lost how far uh they went back whever they had to do they had the privilege to come and receive again their inheritance the whole family would come and receive their inheritance and so it is tonight that men and women here of Louisiana that knows and I could say Stokes Valley or Wellington or wherever that knows the things that we that we do know and have heard from our brother of different ones of our Pentecostal experience years ago and we find that we have walled off we haven't walled ourselves away from it so far as we've got to hear that somebody says instead of what thus sayith the Lord is and we can hear that the word of God's got to say about it now is the hour of Jubilee so he so the prophet's making making an importance into this 50 years now is the Year of Jubilee remember our Jubilee our Jubilee is not to be freed from Creeds and dogmas of man cuz we've been freed from that and we're in Christ but our true Jubilee is the change of this body am amen because our inheritance is in heaven behold I go to prepare a place for you and if I do I'll come again and receive you unto myself John 14 so our our true Jubilee is a change in this body amen it's not to be just freed from a church system and then walk with God it is it is that to walk with God but that's not the final part of our Jubilee our Jubilee is to go into a Rapture our Jubilee is the body change so that's what I'm saying is now is the season of Jubilee maybe just changed the whole emphasis a whole bit you know now is the season of the change of the body am amen we're 50 and it's we're 50 years down the road and to me it's not just that we're 50 years but you see as I said in the beginning you see how God is dealing and not just here but worldwide how things are changing among believers amen I've I've heard testimonies in Europe you know different camps split and all these things and they have a convention they get guest speakers in and then it's just like God just overshadows the whole thing and and and draws people together again and there's now love and harmony among people what's that God is doing something and there's a reason that he's doing it cuz now is the season amen I trust I trust it really SS you know now now is the season and so God the spiritual atmosphere is changing the spiritual at now this maybe I'm going too far out there but this is just my conviction the spiritual atmosphere worldwide is changing that's right amen it is changing because God is wanting to change he's wanting to cause us to go on the next step of the journey amen so the whole atmosphere is changing around the world among the bride and that is because you know he says this is an accepting God's provider way at the end time and this is where he is one of the places where he speaks about the story of of the ducks on the pond now I'm just going to read this to you because I want you to get it you say he's just talking about ducks on a pond no it's like Jesus he just say a parable you know there's like four you so winter so seed and he just lays out very simple oh that's just a children's story it is not a children's story it isn't one way that they can get it but there's great truth that are laid in those Parables amen oh the unjust judge and you know the prodal son oh that's just a isn't that a nice story it's more than a nice story Jesus Jesus speak God speaks in these ways because there's great layers of things in these stories even even things that happened in the prophet's life that he experienced there's great truths that are in those stories you know he speaks about you know like when he's lost on Hurricane Mountain you know the story where he goes he goes on the honeymoon with his with you know Assist leer and he's got Billy Paul there and there and they're up in a cabin or a lan to someplace they don't know the woods he goes hunting a blizzard comes in and he's got to get back to them cuz they can't even light a fire and then now he's lost in this blizzard now that speaks of that speaks of men that speaks of a person lost and he and he said he realized because he said I'll go this way and then and then he real realized and he came back in a full circle and then he realized that what he was getting into was called like an Indian death walk where people go around in circles and then they eventually die because they just can't take it anymore and that and that and that speaks of the human life where where people can just be lost unless God no man can come to unless the father draws him amen it's not it's not you making a decision God put something in you that can make the decision amen salvation is sovereignty is the sovereignty of God alone you know you know the church ruler said make a decision for Christ you can only make that decision of God is calling and all that come through our no wise cast out and so and so he's lost he's lost on this mountain and then he and he realizes that he's going around in a circle and people people can can experience the same thing in their life they go oh wasn't wasn't wasn't this sports game fun and this holiday was neat and now I've got a promotion now different job and now I've got family and wasn't this holiday nice and wasn't this movie neat and wasn't this and and they're just going around in a circle they're going around in a death walk without God but then he realized that there was a wire that had been put in that was running somewhere on that mountain from where he was to where his family was and then he prayed and then he even saw a break in the cloud and he saw the mountain and he says now I'll go this way cuz he thought he knew where he was going and then he felt a hand come on his shoulder cuz he was going in the opposite direction man thinks I'll serve God by doing this and they're going in the opposite direction amen and then so so he turned around and then he was walking he was walking basically nearly I think it was in the dark too I might be wrong and he was trying to find this wire and this blizzard in this Forest cuz he knew it was there somewhere and then so he had to walk along and then eventually he felt the wire I mean held on to that wire amen Christ found him yeah Christ found you there's a wire amen that you're that's hold not you're holding on to it but it HS on to you and you just hold walking holding that wire Hallelujah that's a Christian life amen without god without God turning him around he would have gone the opposite way and he's not he wasn't in a small place he could have walked for months in a certain direction yes amen that's right so this great he tells stories but there's great depth there's so many things in these stories so this is why this is why this he's he just he's just dropping things in amen now he says we know I was speaking about last night the gospel trumpet if it gives an uncertain sound uh um if it gives an uncertain sound his sound he doesn't give an uncertain sound now he's speaking about the Ducks they're real Ducks they know the sound of a duck what if you put an old Guinea out there or a turkey his honk wouldn't sound right they know the sound of a leader and the church ought to know it having a form of godliness denying the power thereof from such don't let them lead he high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers false accusers and continent despisers of those ducks that does fly see see what see what I mean they know what the gospel sound my sheep know my voice and a stranger they'll not follow God always proves it right notice and right they cannot you could not choose for them what if you went out there and said now wait a minute little ducks you're certainly wrong here's a big fine Drake my he looks he looks kingly among you and now you know what I'm going to do I'm going to pour a little water upon the top of his head and I'm going to inaugurate him and I'm going to make him King duck and I'm going to put a crown upon him and dress him a little different so you all will know him always follow this fellow here because he's cultured what does you say give a man an education in the scripture get him to dress a little bit differently let the organization put him in a in a position that's what he's saying amen a man-made leader now turn him loose on the pond he could hunk honk as much as he wanted to every duck would turn his back on him because he gives an uncertain sound yeah but let that little duck that's been chosen of God to be the leader let him honk and watch them all swarm to a REV where the carcasses the Eagles will be gathered he knows all about it see he has a provided way and the Ducks know the provided way too bad that man doesn't all right but that's the way it happens now all right if he is the inspired leader duck he'll bring them to God's provided place for them and if we' only listened to what the leader says the Holy Spirit he'll bring us right back to the word again that's God's provided way along the road we don't need Creeds and denominations and Wild weeds that's certain there's certain duck grass of stuff that we have to eat the Ducks down going down there's food um Heavenly bound creatures eat along the road and that is man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that precedes out of the mouth of God see that duck leader duck will lead them to God's provided place just as straight to Louisiana so leading leading to the rice so you say so you say well he's just talking about ducks no he's not he's saying he says another place he says is like a snow cap comes upon the mountains a cold wind begins to blow over the pond amen and spiritually in this world there's ice caps on every Hill and a cold wind is blowing over this Earth and when that takes place it's when the Ducks the Believers begin to swarm what happens when they swarm they begin to gather together and mean they begin to gather as one as one body CU they all recognize their ducks and me they all recognize they're true boo Believers and then the leader says now is the season and mean the Holy Ghost says now is the season you've been on this Pond long enough now you're going to return to where your parents came from now you're going to return to a place that you don't remember amen and this is and this is where we are amen the Holy Ghost is our leader and he's dictating to the bride around the world now is the season of Jubilee now is the season you're going to go back to your inheritance Hallelujah now is the season because the spiritual atmosphere is changing amen now I'm going to I'm going to turn a little bit but but I'm still talking about uh my thought here return in Jubilee today now the now the Jubilee as I said was a law and it's not a suggestion it was not a suggestion it was a law now God's God you the word of God is God's will how do you know the will of God for your life you know it in the word and this this is what he has declared so it's not this is not a suggestion this is his will being declared this worded his will and so he's not suggesting anything he's saying this is how it is this is what's going to happen and now that's why you can see you know Matthew 1:21 and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins this is my will for the season I'm going to send my I'm going to I'm going to become flesh upon the Earth and he and I shall he shall save his people from their sin that that doesn't mean he might do it he will and if God if God purposes anything in his mind it's going to happen am no no no Humanity no power of man no religion can stop God doing what he wants to do amen you see the Prophet come in and when he you know you you know he says now the angel of the Lord is here at the end of the services he says now I take every Spirit under my control for the glory of God no Spirit raised up and was able to overcome what was going on in those meetings because he is saying now God has given him the authority to take every Spirit under under his control for the glory of God and that's exactly what happened amen because this was God's will I'm going to send Elijah upon the Earth he's going to call out a bride for me this this what he purposed friends what he purposed amen so so if he purposes something it's going to happen now turn with me to Ezekiel chapter 36 I want to read some scripture here and I want you to notice the amounts of times where God says I will I know I think brother Daniel brought this up on Queen's birthday but just in mentioning but I just want to I want I trust it really sinks home when God says I will he's going to do it God is Supreme you know you know in this day and age a man or a wife they choose their spouse but we God God is greater than that selection because he has chosen us and eventually we come easy or we come difficult but we're going to come amen cuz God's will Christianity is not our walk with God is Not democracy it's a Rel it's a love relationship but it's not democracy the church world doesn't dictate to God now God we want it different that's right that's not God has never operated God is a sovereign King he's the Supreme one over heavens and earth amen he's our Lord and he's our King and he dictates not not in a harsh way in a loving way but he dictates Amen to to his church to the world this is how it's going to be amen and then because we love him we say yes Lord because we don't want our own will we want his will to be done hallelujah now he says this let's go in in in verse 23 now notice the I Wills cuz this is you being spoken about in the scripture and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the Heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord sayith the Lord God when I shall be Sanctified in you before their eyes for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all the countries and will bring you into your own land which is your position in Christ then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from your Idols will I cleanse you and new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and I will be your God this what and this is your walk with God he says I'm going to do it hlah he yeah if he's decreed anything it's going to happen I don't yeah I don't have the language ability to put it in any other phrase but if he has spoken something thus is spoken thus it shall be and nothing upon this Earth can stop it there's no power in Hell there's no scheme of man we sing the song by trust it makes you it's more reality there's nothing upon the Earth doesn't matter if the whole world rallies against you that will come to nothing you see Israel how can it stand in that land how can it stand it's God God has allowed them to be a nation and I don't agree with everything that they do but God is ordained that the that they're on that piece of land they got hundreds of millions of hostile Muslims around them but yet they're a nation and yet they're prospering why cuz God said that's right when the Fig Tree puts forth its buds you know some is nigh so now they're planted back in their land and you see the nation of Israel blooming cuz God said this is going to happen hey he said it's going to happen it's there why are they there it's not their technology that that that allows them to survive God wants them there because there's 144,000 elected ones they going to receive the same Christ that we know they every one of them are going to be there am amen you see you know you had Tales of when they're fighting their war of independence in 1948 you know whatever eight time that was they you know most of their weapons were taken by the British and they had to fight fight these hostile you know Arab countries around there's testimonies of of people are going to be killed by the enemy and then Angels appear and all these different things and and the enemy flees why is that because that one God Spar that one's life or those On's lives for a certain purpose because out of them will probably come some of those elected ones amen you just go read about some of the supernatural testimonies that have kept those people and then we're here and we just think now let's just go let's go to Isaiah 49 I'm going to read a few more scriptures but I just I just want this to really sink in remember return and Jubilee Isaiah 49 and we'll read from verse 13 now this is sometimes we think we're a destitute woman we're not amen I'm speaking spiritually as a as as the bride of Christ Isaiah 49:13 sing oh heavens and be joyful o Earth and Break Forth into singing oh Mountains for the Lord has comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted but Zion said now Zion in the Bible is the bride okay the Zion Zion speaks Mount Zion Zion speaks of you Zion is the bride in the scripture I don't have time to go into it but but that's just how it is but Zion said the Lord hath forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten me who's been in that position God's forsaken me he's forgotten me no can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget yet will I not forget thee behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me and that walls actually means a protection amen thy protection is continually before me what's that he's watching you he's watching your protection so sometimes we think that we're destitute I mean oh God's forsaken me no he hasn't because remember this is the bride's confession in a certain season the Lord has forsaken me and my Lord has forgotten me Zion is the bride this is this is the bride's confession in a certain season but then said Lord says no can a woman forget her her son her suckling child she may forget and I don't see how that's possible forgetting child birth and having a child I don't know how people can forget that he said they may do that but I will never forget thee you're engraved on the palms of my hands amen God doesn't forget so now God's will he says in Ephesians 1 and forgive me for all the reading he says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will he works all things upon this Earth after the counsil of his own will he say well the world's so dark and all these evil things he worketh all things he allows things to happen after the council of his own will cuz he's decreed certain things amen so every every work everything upon this Earth is after his own will you may not understand it all things work together for good though that love God and a called and a called according to his purpose you may not understand how it works for the good but just rest this is for my good it's working towards an end which is for my good just don't forget that so it is his will remember he shall they shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins so it is his will that his children go free it is his will that his children are delivered it is his will that you come to your rightful position in Christ that's his will amen amen that's what he wants that's what he's decreed and he says this he says this in John chapter 10 I'm sure these are familiar but I trust it means a bit more today then came the Jews round about him and said unto him how long does thou not um how long does thou make us to doubt but thou be the Christ tell us plainly Jesus answered them I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but you believe not because you're not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand amen no one see there's nothing that can take you out of the hands of God Amen and then he says in in John 6 as this is the Father's will which he sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and Believe on him may have everlasting life and I'll raise him up at the last day so he's saying that I will lose nothing I will not lose a single son a single daughter I'm going to lose none of them that's what he's remember his will is supreme this is what he's declared he will lose nothing amen he's not going to just scrape through with 50% of his bride or 75% of his bride he'll lose no one amen no one that's elected amen me to be part of that number is going to be left behind amen we have that Assurance he says my Father which gave them is greater than all you know the biggest kid in school if he's bigger than everyone else no one can challenge that kid cuz he's bigger than all you understand nothing can challenge God and come off first place nothing can now there's return and Jubilee so we have a criteria now a return the definition of of of the return is to come or go back to a personal place and it's also an act of coming back to a place or activity this is what it means to return and then a jubilee is a year of emancipation and restoration which is kept every 50 years so he's saying this is a time to return back to a former place that you are in and it's a it's a time when all the captives Go free and there's a restoration which takes place so now there's a season remember I you know I I want to say those things you know you know I'll lose Jesus will lose nothing the one you know all that the father's given me shall come and all that come through no wise cast out you know all those things because I want to show you that this is God's will this is God's decree this is how it's going to be and so now if there's a rest restoration if there's a return in Jubilee there's two criteria there's two no wait I think I've got it here there's three there's three criteria only a true Israelite could go free in the Jubilee only a true Israelite remember they're Israelites by birth not by not by their their how good they are how intelligent they are where they are in society what they think of themselves their past that that doesn't come into the equation it's if they're a true Israelite by birth if they're true Israelite by seed then they have a right to go free in the Jubilee and then another criteria was as long as their inheritance now you read Leviticus 25 the whole thing we won't read it just save time but and then another criteria was as long as their inheritance was not in a walled City then it would be returned back to them now W City brother and says like world city is like a denomination things are Wen you got a year to to to get it back and if you don't well you've lost it and then but then the third thing was their inheritance had to be restored to them without question these are the things so without without question as long as they were Israelite by birth not an alien not someone pretending to be an Israelite but as long as they were an Israelite by birth they had a god given right that when that Jubilee trumpet sounded they could return back to what belonged to them amen and that's why Jesus said you know the servant doesn't abide in the house forever but the son abides ever so a servant who wasn't an Israelite they could hear the trumpet but they could never go free it was an Israelite by birth amen and that's why I can put such confidence in God's election because no one no man can come to me unless the father draws him amen so you can't come in your own some people do try and come cuz they think it sounds good but unless the father is not drawing you can never come amen you say well that's pretty strong that's what Jesus said those only those which the well how do you know how do you know the father's drawing cuz something in here says that's true something in here says that's me this is what I've been looking for my entire life that's the drawing when you come under the atmosphere of the word and then the father begins to draw cuz something in here says yes amen that's how you know the father's drawing and you're only and the reason you're being draw is cuz you're have an inheritance has been laid up for you because you're part of him amen remember the other other ones I could be a servant in Israel people will get excited when they hear the Jubilee trumpet it wouldn't mean anything to me because it's not for me it doesn't mean anything to me I'd hear the same sound I could watch them shout and rejoice but I could just but I you well I'm not an Israelite that doesn't apply to me there's nothing in here to respond that's that's what I've been looking for amen so it's very different now when the bride it doesn't matter what condition she's born in or where she's from or what background or past your background has nothing to do with it the the the trials of Life you've gone through that's irrelevant in God's election all that the father has given me will come and he said they will come they're going to come they must come amen hallelujah right amen I say God just draw us to yourself Hallelujah so now he so that is the law now if there an Israelite if they're part of the family amen if they're part of the family they have a right they have a right to what belongs to them and it's a law they must receive what belongs to them amen you can take that for whatever you want it to be a closer walk with God back baptism of the Holy Ghost to really know the author that that that sent the message and wrote this word I mean to walk with him like we're meant to walk with him that's our inheritance amen our families to be restored as our inheritance Abraham lot wasn't Abraham's son lot was Abraham's nephew but because he believed this is part of what belongs to me he had a right to arm his servants and go get him back they went against trained armies he just armed his servants with I don't know what weapons they had amen but because God because Abraham was standing in his position he had a right to get back what belongs to him amen you have to I trust to just anchors in when you see your family say Lord draw them am mean they're part of my inheritance they're part of my family doesn't matter what they're doing and what they're saying and what comes out of this thing don't look at what comes out you know if you looked at Paul you know Saul before he became Paul you think there's no way this man can be a church a there's no way this man serpent seed a lot of people would looked and said this man's your serpent said you'll never be a believer amen don't don't look at this what comes out of this and what happens you say godu they're part of me husband and wife are one Hallelujah family's one amen lay lay hold am hey God is you say well I don't have much of a burden say God give me a burden this this world wants to make us indifferent and wants to make us not care and just get caught up in the busyness of life and while we come to church on Sunday and we do this in a little bit throw it off amen am mean doesn't mean you you you disregard your responsibilities do what you're called to do if it's if it's raise your family work or whatever it is do it as unto the Lord but don't let it just dull your spiritual senses don't let it dull your your Zeal for God whatever you do amen it doesn't matter if you you know stir up the gift within the hallah we are we are living in a jubilee season amen I feel the Lord taugh me to say we're living in a jubilee season amen we're not called just to say well we're tired and these things are all you know this world is a curse I said it in the beginning but this this Society is a curse am mean we have too much we have too much you know what does that mean should I go live in a shack no you don't have to go live in a shack but make sure your life is ordered around the right way amen don't get caught up in the busyness of life amen amen you know God if you're too busy you say God rearrange my life don't try and work it out well this is how it's going say God my heart is for you first and foremost so Lord rearrange my life that I can serve you how you want me to serve you amen amen we have a right to walk back into our inheritance amen and and you may be standing in your inheritance but there's more to possess am mean there's more of God to have Hallelujah we have a right to it friends we have a right to walk with him Hallelujah well I've got children that's busy sure it is God gave you those children to raise amen that they would see God as alive and well hallelujah amen amen don't don't don't don't neglect your family but don't let it take you away from God pray for a balance whatever you do amen amen now so we have a right we have a right to the body change God has determined God has determined determined that we take a Rapture he's decreed it there's going to be a people that are alive and remain in this hour there's going to be a people that are alive and remain that that is his word that is his decree amen and so we're living in a season now where every man woman and child that something in here says that's me amen you can be walking through an airport I've heard other preachers say there an analogy but you hear people's name your know names come over the loudspeaker and Mr so and so whatever come to this place if it's not your name it doesn't mean anything to you but then when you hear your name come out of the loudspeaker n he stand still and you listen what was the message for me what is what is this voice telling me cuz there's a purpose in this voice speaking to me it's the same thing with the gospel friends the reason you say well I've never heard my voice audibly if there's something in here that resonates that speaks to you like nothing El something moves you that is your voice that is your name being SP called then you should stand still and say now what do you got to tell me Father what are you what are you wanting to tell me and the devil likes to come along and says it's not for you it's for someone else you know this is not yours I say throw that offall and say God this is mine Hallelujah to walk with you hey Jesus your God said he's not willing that any would perish any should perish do not let the devil get in your mind that someone's Beyond Redemption do not get in your mind that your family or whoever it is do not allow that in your mind God God will sort out who's going to be there and who shouldn't be there it's not our job to put people in boxes and whatever more just you know brother say that same servant you be a kinsman redeemer yes take your Bible under your arm go into the night after your brother he says that that's how you be a Kinsman you go after your brother or your system amen you go share the word with them or just just be around them say Lord may they drop into this atmosphere Hallelujah may may Faith rise in their hearts yes sir Hallelujah we got friends and they like to hang around us they're not even Christian they don't know why I know why cuz God's Among Us amen that's why we should we should spread the light you I try you I'm sure you can think back or even now there's some people that they just love hanging around you and it's actually not just you they love there's an unseen one the very Lord Of Glory some people can't stand I know myself some people just can't stand being in my presence because God you know I had a friend one of our best best drinking buddies at Uni and then I meet the Lord we yeah we're both still at Uni and we meet each other in the supermarket I haven't witnessed to him I haven't said anything to him and he didn't want to we just said hello and he you could just tell his body language I don't want to be here I don't want to spend a single time with you I never saw him again amen right what is that something in me he didn't like anymore right amen but some people they just love to be around you why is that cuz Christ is there amen go after your brother and sister you say well I've tried pray and go again say Lord lead me lead me to say the right thing you say well it's failed I tell you what for 49 years they had no Jubilee that's right there it wasn't the right season but then there came a season of Jubilee yes amen where they had a god-given right that everyone had to return to their possession praise God Amen God is waiting upon you you're you're his hands and feet you're his hands and feet upon this earth oh Lord go speak to that person sometimes he just does it but the me times actually saying well what are you doing about it you go speak to them I don't know what to say just drop something in and then if you don't know what else to share because sometimes you you're there and you say you know you're in your heart son of man's being revealed we're in the season of the Resurrection you want you share these things cuz it's so glorious we're living in the season of The Rapture Hallelujah am and you how do I Lord how do I kind of boil that down to just start how do I begin tell them how your candle got lit tell them that this God is real Jesus has stepped out of History he's a real God today and he is yes amen because many times you know sometimes it's like it's like doing Mission work and you getting in these things 99% of the time I actually don't want to use the word Christian or missionary because people put you in this uh this box of this is and we're not that by God's grace amen amen so if you can tell them you you know you know it's like you said tell someone oh so so what happened Sunday I went to church and they put you in that box whatever they think it is but if you tell them you know you if the conversation opens God became real to me and this is what happened that's a totally different box and they have never experienced that amen it's a whole different way of think what and what does that do Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God and a testimony to me is the word of God as well because it's this being lived out yes it's not just a theory anymore but it's a living reality Hallelujah go be a Kinsman amen that's what we're called to do was a god-given right because because he by Grace had inherited it no it won't be much longer and it um it would have been given to his fathers handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free it meant Grace is is uh it meant Grace is way provided for each individual Knight to return to their rightful inheritance what a picture it gives us tonight of the church in this last days we see what man can do then we see what God does What man does is failing and will fail and has failed and always will fail but what God does is eternal and must forever remain nothing can ever take it away God give it it's his free gift and by sovereign and foresight saw it and placed it and there's nothing can ever move it it's there eternally and at Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace To His People by restoring or be brought back to their rightful position now I believe that this is the hour again of Jubilee I believe it's the time of Jubilee I believe that 50 years ago in Lou in Louisiana this great state where the Pentecostal people are powerful and strong I believe that God set an operation a church See's saying I believe this is now the season of Jubilee and we are living in that season again friends amen I'm just I'm just going to close with this I just trust you Ponder you say this word this message has been sent is to set us free Amen to return us back to our original inheritance our position in Christ that's what the the message reveals Christ in here amen it's not another another testimony it's this testimony amen so we're living in a jubilee season take advantage of the Jubilee season because I believe in my own self there will not be another 50 years I believe it's too far gone down the road take advantage of it you say Lord I'm busy said then ask him cuz he knows you're busy if you're busy he knows if you're not busy but say Lord help me to redeem the time and I this is what I've been trying to do help me to redeem you know a cell phone is a great curse but it's also a great blessing or a computer whatever more cuz there goes 45 minutes where did that go why did I just read bunch of nonsense most of the time Lord help me to redeem the time I only have this season amen amen I have this season Lord I want to use this season for your will not for my will Christianity is self-denial amen that's right any man forsake himself let him take up no if any man want to be my disciple let him you know forsake Him yo yo deny himself take up his cross and follow me yes amen we have to friends we have a right to return we have the right cuz we are a seed of God amen amen if God has ever spoken to you in your life you're a seat of God Amen if there's something in here that means you're a se you there something in here that I want to serve the Lord you may not know how or why or you know you may have a lot of questions and all different things but there something in here and whatever you do do not let this world drown that voice out that's because this you know as brother thus said this world is full of voices amen there's a thous million voices screaming out in this world do not let it drown out that voice in here whatever you do amen should we bow our heads and with every head bowed if you'd like to respond with an uplifted hand or maybe you'd like to stand as we pray if you want more of the Lord gracious Heavenly Father dear Lord we're here we're in a season of
