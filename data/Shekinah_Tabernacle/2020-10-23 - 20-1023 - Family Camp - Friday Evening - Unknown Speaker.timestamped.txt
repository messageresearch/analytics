[4:56] welcome to camp god bless you all great
[4:59] to have everyone here really
[5:01] thank you for coming have this weekend
[5:03] with us
[5:04] um i just got a few announcements we've
[5:06] gotta go through
[5:08] um yeah god bless god bless you all
[5:12] so in in the unlikely event of a fire um
[5:15] we need to all go congregate out on the
[5:17] field um
[5:19] you know we have to go through the camp
[5:20] things every every time but yeah so
[5:23] um no swimming please in the pool um it
[5:26] may be
[5:26] appear to be hot but it's not actually
[5:27] not that hot kitchen duties
[5:30] so um everyone should have been assigned
[5:32] to a duty you'll see by the door here
[5:34] into the dining room there is a list of
[5:36] duties
[5:37] and under each of those jobs there's the
[5:39] time which you need to be there so
[5:40] please go
[5:41] find out where you are and what you're
[5:43] doing and and please be punctual there
[5:46] um to help uh yeah they'd be greatly
[5:49] appreciated so
[5:51] then also the toilets if you need to use
[5:53] the bathroom um
[5:55] during service i advise just hold on but
[5:58] um you know you never want to miss what
[5:59] the lord can do but
[6:00] or will do but they're directly
[6:01] underneath the chapel you go down the
[6:03] ramp here
[6:04] hang a sharp left and go under and
[6:06] that's where the toilets are
[6:09] um and can we ask please can there be no
[6:11] playing
[6:12] kicking balls around in the gym after
[6:14] service because you want to keep an
[6:16] atmosphere in here and i believe the
[6:17] lord's going to do something
[6:18] i believe he's going to really do
[6:20] something powerful this weekend i mean
[6:22] and then also
[6:23] after the evening service um children
[6:25] i'm sorry but the playground is going to
[6:26] be closed
[6:27] because uh last camp you know a lot of
[6:30] kids are playing but
[6:31] mums are trying to put their babies to
[6:32] sleep and there's a lot of noise so
[6:34] please know in the playground after the
[6:36] evening service
[6:38] and then also after the evening service
[6:41] you know there's
[6:42] we're going to have supper so you know
[6:44] don't go wander off by yourself maybe
[6:46] more for the young people but you know
[6:47] don't go
[6:48] become one with nature somewhere by
[6:50] yourself wandering off you know have
[6:51] fellowship in the
[6:52] you know here or you know in the dining
[6:54] hall outside you know
[6:56] so don't just go wandering off um
[6:59] you know there's plenty of places to
[7:01] fellowship and also if
[7:03] you wish to go fishing in the lake uh
[7:06] you need to see brother mario
[7:08] and you also need to get a license and
[7:10] all that dutch to me so you'll see
[7:12] brother marion he will take you fishing
[7:15] pending
[7:16] his decision yay or nay um
[7:19] but yeah so that's uh essentially
[7:22] all of all of the messages i have but i
[7:25] believe we're in for a good time
[7:26] yes so once again just see what duty
[7:28] you're on what time it's it's all on the
[7:30] board there
[7:32] yeah i just want to read a quote before
[7:34] i turn the service over to
[7:35] to brother isaac brother abraham says
[7:37] and what shall i do with jesus called
[7:39] christ is in 1964 so after the seals
[7:41] have come open
[7:42] he says the dynamics of this church will
[7:44] be a refilling of the holy ghost
[7:47] that we have worked in a small measure
[7:49] while the headstone is coming down to
[7:51] unite with the body
[7:53] but when that head and body unites
[7:54] together the full power of the holy
[7:56] ghost would raise her
[7:58] up just exactly even the dead that's
[8:00] dead in christ for hundreds of years ago
[8:02] will rise in the beauty of his holiness
[8:04] and take a flight
[8:05] through the skies the dynamics is the
[8:08] holy ghost
[8:09] so i believe there's a season we're in
[8:12] the world has fallen apart
[8:14] and it's going to continue to fall apart
[8:15] but the bride's coming into order with
[8:17] the word
[8:18] hallelujah so i believe the dynamics of
[8:20] this church will be a refilling of the
[8:21] holy ghost
[8:22] and personally that's why i've come for
[8:24] this weekend lord would do something in
[8:26] my life
[8:27] and um you know this sign here
[8:30] to the world is a sign of defeat
[8:34] but to the christian this is a sign of
[8:35] victory
[8:37] as as moses hands were lifted up
[8:41] it was for the rest of israel to win the
[8:44] battle
[8:45] and then samson he pushed the pillars
[8:47] out
[8:48] did the same sign and he died with his
[8:50] enemy and they won a great victory
[8:52] and then our lord jesus was lifted up
[8:54] between heaven and earth
[8:55] his hands raised like this out of self
[8:58] will
[8:59] and he conquered hal death in the grave
[9:01] so i think what we should do
[9:03] before we start these meetings or say
[9:04] let's start these meetings right
[9:06] you know we don't need to wait for
[9:07] sunday night for god to touch our lives
[9:09] and change us
[9:10] what about right now before the service
[9:12] even begins
[9:13] and we can dedicate our hearts to the
[9:15] lord and you know we can just
[9:17] empty ourselves out so he can fill us up
[9:19] amen and he can do a great work so
[9:22] you know shall we just stand together
[9:23] and let's just let's just dedicate our
[9:25] lives to the lord let's just surrender
[9:26] our lives to lord
[9:28] tonight and if you have a knee just want

[1:06:32] god is going to lead us
[1:06:34] so we read in acts chapter 3 and we just
[1:06:37] want to read
[1:06:39] from verse 19
[1:06:42] repent he therefore and be converted
[1:06:46] that your sins may be blotted out
[1:06:49] when the times of refreshing shall come
[1:06:52] from the presence of the lord and he
[1:06:55] shall send jesus christ
[1:06:57] which before was preached unto you whom
[1:07:00] the heavens
[1:07:01] must receive until the times of
[1:07:04] restitution
[1:07:06] of all things i want you to note of all
[1:07:09] things
[1:07:10] which god hath spoken by the mouth of
[1:07:13] all these holy prophets
[1:07:15] since the world begun then we we just
[1:07:19] turn
[1:07:19] to ephesians 5
[1:07:24] which is one verse of scripture there
[1:07:27] ephesians 5
[1:07:31] and we just verse 25
[1:07:34] and 26
[1:07:37] and 27 husbands love your wives
[1:07:41] even as christ also loved the church and
[1:07:44] gave himself for
[1:07:46] it that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:07:49] by the washing of the water by the word
[1:07:52] verse 27 is really what i want to take
[1:07:55] note on
[1:07:56] that he might present it to himself a
[1:07:59] glorious church
[1:08:00] not having spot nor wrinkle or any such
[1:08:04] thing
[1:08:05] but it should be holy and without
[1:08:08] blemish and just the last scripture
[1:08:09] matthew chapter 17
[1:08:15] i believe this is the hour that we are
[1:08:17] living in
[1:08:19] i believe everything has been restored
[1:08:22] now we are just awaiting
[1:08:25] the going away hallelujah

[1:11:30] tonight i will restore all things
[1:11:33] i will restore all things and i was
[1:11:35] looking at that
[1:11:37] word restitution and it means the
[1:11:40] restoring of something stolen
[1:11:43] or lost back to the proper owner
[1:11:47] we thank god for this hour and time
[1:11:51] that there is nothing else that must be
[1:11:53] restored
[1:11:55] everything has been restored malachi 4
[1:11:57] said it himself with the restoration
[1:11:59] of the word came the restoration of the
[1:12:02] power
[1:12:04] now you tonight might say brother i
[1:12:06] don't
[1:12:07] see any power in my life to fulfill the
[1:12:10] scripture but i want to tell you some
[1:12:12] way
[1:12:12] there is someone fulfilling that
[1:12:15] scripture
[1:12:17] might not be you you might not be there
[1:12:19] yet
[1:12:20] but there are some people out there
[1:12:23] believers
[1:12:24] that is fulfilling that scripture
[1:12:26] experiencing
[1:12:28] the power of the world
[1:12:31] so i'm so grateful tonight that amen our
[1:12:35] hearts have been turned
[1:12:37] uh god sent us a prophet our hearts have
[1:12:39] been turned
[1:12:40] and we just want to just read this
[1:12:43] quickly brother branham says
[1:12:45] uh this is what malachi 4 5 and 6 says
[1:12:49] he says behold i will send you elijah
[1:12:52] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:12:54] great and the dreadful day of the lord
[1:12:57] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:12:59] fathers to the children
[1:13:01] and the heart of the children to their
[1:13:02] fathers lest i come and smite the earth
[1:13:05] with a curse there is absolutely no
[1:13:08] doubt
[1:13:10] that eli elijah must must return
[1:13:14] before the coming of jesus because he
[1:13:16] has a specific
[1:13:18] work to accomplish and that work
[1:13:21] is the part of malachi 4 6
[1:13:25] that says he will turn the hearts of the
[1:13:28] children to the fathers
[1:13:30] the reason that we know that this easy
[1:13:33] specific
[1:13:34] work to do at that time is because he
[1:13:37] has already
[1:13:38] accomplished the part that says he shall
[1:13:41] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:13:43] children that's john the baptist
[1:13:45] ministry brother banham says the bible
[1:13:47] says
[1:13:48] uh he says he shall go before him luke 1
[1:13:51] 17
[1:13:52] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[1:13:54] and power of elijah
[1:13:56] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:13:58] children
[1:13:59] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:14:01] just
[1:14:02] to make really a people prepared for the
[1:14:05] lord
[1:14:06] he says in the ministry of john the
[1:14:08] hearts of the fathers
[1:14:10] were turned to the children he says we
[1:14:13] know that because jesus said
[1:14:15] so but it does not say that the hearts
[1:14:18] of the children
[1:14:19] were turned to the fathers that is yet
[1:14:22] to take place
[1:14:23] that was then still had to take place
[1:14:27] the hearts of the last day children will
[1:14:29] be turned back
[1:14:30] to the pentecostal fathers john god the
[1:14:33] fathers ready
[1:14:35] for jesus to welcome the children into
[1:14:38] his fold now this
[1:14:39] prophet upon whom the spirit of elijah
[1:14:42] falls
[1:14:43] will prepare the children to welcome
[1:14:46] back
[1:14:47] jesus christ so we thank god amen
[1:14:52] that we have received the ministry we
[1:14:54] have received the word
[1:14:56] we thank god that there were some seeds
[1:14:58] lying there
[1:14:59] in this age amen and when the word came
[1:15:03] forth brother it quick and brother
[1:15:05] branham says
[1:15:06] never quit came to quicken the dust
[1:15:10] although the dust enrapped the seed
[1:15:14] but he says he came the sun came to
[1:15:17] quicken the life
[1:15:19] and i thank god rather when we were all
[1:15:21] running the world
[1:15:23] when we were doing our thing outside
[1:15:25] there that seed
[1:15:28] was already there hallelujah
[1:15:31] it didn't come when god saved you
[1:15:35] no it was already there when we were all
[1:15:38] sitting in the pub and gambling dice and
[1:15:42] doing what we did
[1:15:43] that see it's already there
[1:15:48] you might not understand why something
[1:15:51] about the word attracted to you
[1:15:53] was because there was a life there in
[1:15:56] you i remember when i was walking
[1:15:59] brother coming from the pub and there
[1:16:01] was men preaching the gospel
[1:16:04] and i just found myself standing
[1:16:07] listening to the gospel my buddies were
[1:16:10] all telling me to come along
[1:16:12] they're drunk but there was something
[1:16:15] there
[1:16:17] that arrested me something had
[1:16:21] apprehended me
[1:16:23] i couldn't move and this went on
[1:16:26] for years but brother one day

[1:16:37] that seed came to life and here i am
[1:16:42] since 1960

[1:16:52] sometimes of course
[1:16:56] don't look at me as if you didn't feel
[1:16:58] that way
[1:17:02] of course we're human we all felt at
[1:17:05] times when the pressure
[1:17:07] came upon us and we had to make choices
[1:17:11] we felt man this is this is this is not
[1:17:14] for me but it was something
[1:17:18] that held us something keep holding me
[1:17:23] every day i see is a reality
[1:17:29] something keep holding me
[1:17:32] so what a glorious hour we find
[1:17:34] ourselves living
[1:17:36] what a glorious brother bands is a
[1:17:38] glorious time he says
[1:17:39] sayers and and the sages were looking
[1:17:42] for a time like this but here we are
[1:17:45] god is now in his people in the person
[1:17:49] of the holy ghost
[1:17:50] and he's now veiled hallelujah
[1:17:54] hidden behind human skin brother ban
[1:17:57] says the
[1:17:58] outside look like a holy roller but he
[1:18:01] says on the inside there's god
[1:18:04] hallelujah paul put so beautiful he says
[1:18:07] that he says there's a treasure
[1:18:10] in earthen vessels and rather
[1:18:13] in this frail body of ours
[1:18:17] almighty god is living
[1:18:21] no longer the size of a white button
[1:18:26] no longer the size of your fingernail
[1:18:31] that was when he came in but now he's
[1:18:34] grown
[1:18:36] now he's big now he's mighty
[1:18:41] living in me and you and by him growing
[1:18:46] he has now pushed out the human part
[1:18:50] he has pushed out the parts brother
[1:18:52] that's giving him us so much
[1:18:54] trouble in this walk
[1:18:57] but god has been growing so now he's
[1:19:00] veiled brother hallelujah
[1:19:03] in me and you and this is the hour that
[1:19:07] he's got to be veiled there is
[1:19:10] no any more time after this
[1:19:13] this is the hour brother that brother
[1:19:15] brad at the bible say they will be on
[1:19:18] the earth a glorious church
[1:19:22] she will be without spot she will
[1:19:23] without wrinkles she will be without any
[1:19:26] blemishes
[1:19:28] and i'm looking at them you might
[1:19:31] tonight look at your failures your
[1:19:33] mistakes your faults your shortcomings
[1:19:36] but god does not look at you and me the
[1:19:40] way we
[1:19:42] and the enemy wants you to see yourself
[1:19:46] as a failure wants to see you as a
[1:19:50] brother as with these complexes that has
[1:19:53] imprisoned us for years
[1:19:57] but now we're so glad that god has
[1:20:00] opened up our understanding i want to
[1:20:02] read a little quote here
[1:20:05] i don't know maybe this quote will just
[1:20:07] set you free
[1:20:09] just said this quote set me free have
[1:20:12] you ever never read it as a private
[1:20:14] interview the brandon had with his
[1:20:16] sister bruce
[1:20:18] amen and he's having this intima and
[1:20:21] because she had a problem
[1:20:22] she was looking at herself and she saw a
[1:20:26] failures
[1:20:27] and brother bam says sister bruce
[1:20:30] don't look at yourself don't look at
[1:20:33] yourself
[1:20:35] he says i'm fixing to pray for you he
[1:20:38] says i'm i'm not worthy of that
[1:20:40] this is this is our prophet eh i'm not
[1:20:43] worthy of that i think
[1:20:45] what what would i do if jesus
[1:20:48] was sitting here now now can you imagine
[1:20:50] brother branham is sitting there since
[1:20:52] the bruce is sitting here
[1:20:53] they're having this conversation and
[1:20:56] he's telling you now what if jesus
[1:20:59] was now sitting here and you were
[1:21:01] sitting the side
[1:21:03] he says what would he do he would lay
[1:21:06] his hand upon you
[1:21:09] and with his great faith see you would
[1:21:12] get well
[1:21:14] well he says well probably says well i'm
[1:21:17] a sinner
[1:21:18] i'm not him but i come to represent
[1:21:22] him but remember me
[1:21:25] being a sinner but before god
[1:21:29] i am not a sinner neither are you
[1:21:34] he says you've got a blood sacrifice
[1:21:37] laying there
[1:21:39] god don't even see us
[1:21:43] he hears our voice
[1:21:46] but he sees the blood of jesus
[1:21:51] he sees the blood of christ
[1:21:54] that's it he sees the blood of his own
[1:21:58] son it's our voice
[1:22:02] but it's christ's blood
[1:22:03] [Music]
[1:22:06] then he says it's christ that's talking
[1:22:10] through me that's true
[1:22:13] so therefore we are not sinners
[1:22:16] no more hallelujah
[1:22:20] oh my he says we are christians
[1:22:24] and he talk looks this is the bruce and
[1:22:26] he says i believe you're a genuine
[1:22:28] christian woman then she said something
[1:22:30] that
[1:22:31] many of us often say
[1:22:35] i make so many mistakes
[1:22:38] and i failed god so many times
[1:22:42] that's what we all say but i want to
[1:22:45] encourage you
[1:22:47] and then looks at them and says that's
[1:22:49] why christ had to die
[1:22:53] because of your mistakes because of your
[1:22:56] failures
[1:22:57] he says that's the reason why christ had
[1:22:59] to die
[1:23:00] so that you with your mistakes it won't
[1:23:04] be
[1:23:04] allotted to you
[1:23:08] it won't be allotted to you man
[1:23:11] hallelujah because brother bam says when
[1:23:14] he
[1:23:15] when he when he dips it into that bleach
[1:23:18] he says
[1:23:19] that son brother goes right back to the
[1:23:23] guy that
[1:23:24] caused you to do the thing
[1:23:27] yes sir so he is all your failures your
[1:23:31] sin
[1:23:31] it's all on him but you are free
[1:23:36] he says he took your mistakes
[1:23:39] your desire in your heart is to serve
[1:23:42] him
[1:23:43] and says the bruce says yes so your
[1:23:46] desire in your heart to serve him
[1:23:49] i've seen i see very few
[1:23:53] no we don't shake our heads we open our
[1:23:55] mouths
[1:23:56] and we say praise god brother
[1:23:59] [Applause]
[1:24:00] hallelujah he says your brother he says
[1:24:04] that's why he died for you so that you
[1:24:07] could
[1:24:07] serve him your mistakes are not
[1:24:11] looked at it's not allotted to you
[1:24:15] he is your propagation he is your sin
[1:24:19] offering
[1:24:20] your sins are not known you're not the
[1:24:23] sinner before god he says christ took
[1:24:26] your sins and
[1:24:28] became you because your desire is to
[1:24:32] serve
[1:24:32] him oh my i am that's my desires brother
[1:24:37] hallelujah and many times when i fail
[1:24:39] him i says god you
[1:24:40] know my desires you know my longest and
[1:24:44] i say lord
[1:24:45] i'm so glad that you know all things
[1:24:47] about me
[1:24:48] because then you know about me you know
[1:24:51] about me
[1:24:53] hallelujah oh my
[1:24:56] says you before god you're not a sinner
[1:24:59] christ took your sins and became you
[1:25:02] and sister bruce now says but i've never
[1:25:05] had an
[1:25:05] experience that i have been fold with
[1:25:08] the holy ghost
[1:25:10] so that i can put my foot on it
[1:25:14] okay brother braham says notice this
[1:25:17] ordinarily
[1:25:19] a human being is being born in sin
[1:25:22] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:25:25] speaking lies
[1:25:26] that's the nature of the human being
[1:25:29] and sister bruce says yes that was your
[1:25:32] nature
[1:25:34] brother branham says to her but he
[1:25:36] changed once
[1:25:39] but what changed it christ
[1:25:43] there you are sister hallelujah
[1:25:47] he says you are a christian sister bruce
[1:25:49] with the failures with the mistakes
[1:25:52] with the shortcomings he says you are a
[1:25:54] christian sister bruce
[1:25:56] i have watched your life i've watched
[1:25:58] you under vision
[1:25:59] and i know you're a christian not one
[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:06] speck
[1:26:08] your failures your mistakes your
[1:26:12] shortcomings and brother malachi forces
[1:26:14] men not
[1:26:15] one god don't see not
[1:26:18] one speck
[1:26:22] not one spec
[1:26:26] now i'm talking to born again
[1:26:29] i'm not talking about to those that have
[1:26:32] come into the message and
[1:26:34] just gone the two stages justification
[1:26:37] sanctification
[1:26:39] haven't you taken that gone into that
[1:26:42] birth
[1:26:42] i'm not talking about i'm not talking to
[1:26:44] those because your son is still very
[1:26:47] much alive before god
[1:26:50] but he says once you have been born
[1:26:52] again
[1:26:53] when your soul has been regenerated
[1:26:57] hallelujah you see not your flesh the
[1:26:59] flesh guy
[1:27:00] can never be saved this flesh guy
[1:27:03] is a sinner he's an animal
[1:27:06] so brother we're not talking about the
[1:27:08] flesh guy
[1:27:10] we're talking about the inward man
[1:27:12] that's been regenerated
[1:27:15] that has got a new nature
[1:27:18] and that new nature is manifested
[1:27:21] in the spirit that you produce that new
[1:27:25] nature because
[1:27:26] your your soul is the spirit as the
[1:27:29] nature of your of your spirit so
[1:27:32] so god comes and he changes
[1:27:36] the inside of you brother gives you new
[1:27:39] desires
[1:27:41] gives you new longings if you still
[1:27:44] desire the world
[1:27:46] then we need to check up why the desire
[1:27:50] for the world
[1:27:52] why i must so easily swayed and
[1:27:54] persuaded
[1:27:56] and attracted why i'm being influenced
[1:27:59] from a bottom
[1:28:00] and not from the top we need to look at
[1:28:04] these things
[1:28:06] we cannot sweep it under the carpet you
[1:28:09] cannot hope for it
[1:28:10] you cannot wish for it it's got to be a
[1:28:13] reality in your life
[1:28:15] that you have been born again you've
[1:28:17] been baptized with the holy ghost
[1:28:19] brother
[1:28:20] and you are growing in the grace
[1:28:23] of our lord jesus christ
[1:28:26] so your new birth doesn't just stop
[1:28:30] no it's a constant growing
[1:28:33] and it's a constant desire for
[1:28:36] more of god doesn't matter what you go
[1:28:40] through
[1:28:41] doesn't matter what the trials you go
[1:28:43] through you say god
[1:28:44] my yearnings and my desires
[1:28:48] is after you more of you
[1:28:52] more of you i tell you tonight church
[1:28:55] that is
[1:28:56] should be every one of our desires
[1:28:59] for more of you hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:04] oh my the problem got a little quote
[1:29:06] that i just want to
[1:29:08] finish off here probably now says
[1:29:12] talking about the church now the heavens
[1:29:16] are containing him cannot come
[1:29:19] can't come down to come and pick us up
[1:29:22] because we need everything need to be
[1:29:26] in order everything needs to be
[1:29:29] in order and brother barron now
[1:29:33] talks about the church that she was
[1:29:36] when paul came on the scene he said
[1:29:40] she was already a fallen woman
[1:29:43] okay in the resume of the church ages
[1:29:48] now she is not this message for a church
[1:29:51] first of all
[1:29:52] it's not turning our hearts it's not
[1:29:55] taking us back to pentecost
[1:29:57] but it's taking us back to pentecost
[1:30:00] plus
[1:30:01] it's taking us back to eden
[1:30:06] that's where this message has taken us
[1:30:09] back
[1:30:10] to eden like we were before the fall
[1:30:14] now brother bannon says the birth of the
[1:30:17] church
[1:30:18] was at pentecost he says as the first
[1:30:21] adam was given a bride
[1:30:23] he says fresh from the hand of god
[1:30:26] and she was undefiled for a brief
[1:30:30] span so was christ
[1:30:34] the last adam he says
[1:30:38] was given a bride she was pure
[1:30:42] and she was fresh at pentecost
[1:30:45] and she remained separate
[1:30:48] and undefiled for some time
[1:30:52] and the rest just not no man
[1:30:56] joined himself to them acts 5 13
[1:30:59] and the lord added to the church daily
[1:31:02] such as should be saved
[1:31:04] now brother bam says how long this
[1:31:07] continued
[1:31:08] we don't know this is the church he's
[1:31:12] coming for
[1:31:14] but one day even as eve was tempted
[1:31:18] and seduced by satan so
[1:31:21] the church was contaminated by the
[1:31:24] entrance of an antichrist so what
[1:31:27] brother venom is saying
[1:31:29] when he restores this church me and you
[1:31:33] is not restoring us brother as such
[1:31:37] to pentecost but what he's saying
[1:31:41] is restoring us to a people
[1:31:44] that was before she fell
[1:31:47] before she became contaminated when
[1:31:50] these things were happening in the
[1:31:53] church
[1:31:54] no man could add himself to the church
[1:31:58] no man can just walk in and say i'm in
[1:32:01] the message
[1:32:02] it had to be god by
[1:32:05] that power that was in the church
[1:32:09] so she was a clean church she was a pure
[1:32:12] church she was a church full of love
[1:32:15] she was a church that brother brother
[1:32:17] balaam says when they heard
[1:32:19] that someone was going to die they said
[1:32:23] let us go with him and die with him
[1:32:27] that was what was in that church age
[1:32:30] before she fell
[1:32:34] and this i believe brother that we are
[1:32:37] going to have
[1:32:38] that kind of a church that's the one
[1:32:41] that's going to be on the earth when he
[1:32:43] comes
[1:32:45] that's the one brother that they will
[1:32:47] have such a love
[1:32:50] in their hearts for one another that's
[1:32:53] the kind and i can
[1:32:54] see it's happening amongst god's people
[1:32:59] brother we are starting to prefer one
[1:33:02] another
[1:33:03] we are starting now to lift up one
[1:33:05] another
[1:33:06] we are starting now by his grace brother
[1:33:10] to give off ourselves for their sakes
[1:33:15] that's the church and i'm so glad i am
[1:33:18] looking
[1:33:21] the angels one time brother bran says
[1:33:23] ask the lord
[1:33:25] why are you going back to earth what are
[1:33:27] you going to do
[1:33:28] on earth and then malachi 4 said and the
[1:33:32] lord
[1:33:32] said to him i'm going
[1:33:36] for a people and i'm thank god
[1:33:40] i'm looking at that people
[1:33:44] tonight brother and sister
[1:33:47] i'm looking at that people tonight
[1:33:51] and i thank god brother for the hour
[1:33:54] that we are living he says now
[1:33:55] recognizing your day and his message
[1:33:58] he says now the seventh angel's message
[1:34:01] is to open the mystery of the seals now
[1:34:03] we know these things okay he says
[1:34:06] calling the 11th
[1:34:07] hour gentile workers to receive the same
[1:34:11] pain
[1:34:12] that the first hour worker got he said
[1:34:15] jesus taught it
[1:34:17] he said there was some some people that
[1:34:19] went into the harvest they were hired
[1:34:22] and when they did it was early morning
[1:34:24] they received
[1:34:25] time a penny for the day and then at
[1:34:28] noon time
[1:34:29] someone else come in and went to work
[1:34:32] and then at the 11th hour that's the
[1:34:34] last hour of the day
[1:34:37] that someone come in and receive the
[1:34:39] same kind of pay
[1:34:41] that they did at the first hour of the
[1:34:43] day problems it's the last hour
[1:34:46] he says it is so perfectly
[1:34:49] how that the first hour messengers
[1:34:52] were the word with the gospel with the
[1:34:56] truth
[1:34:57] they came it in at the day of pentecost
[1:35:00] then there was a dark age that blocked
[1:35:02] them out
[1:35:03] then at the middle of the day luther and
[1:35:06] wesley and them came in
[1:35:08] then there is to be an evening time
[1:35:10] message
[1:35:13] and to receive the same thing
[1:35:16] that they did at the beginning the
[1:35:19] evening time messenger
[1:35:21] is to restore back again to bring back
[1:35:25] the same thing again
[1:35:28] not a new thing the same life
[1:35:32] the same power the same anointing
[1:35:36] brother oh this this is what being
[1:35:39] restored back
[1:35:41] praise his holy name amen i
[1:35:45] tell you tonight brother sister man that

[1:35:59] and that word materializes

[1:56:58] was truth hallelujah
[1:57:02] so church we so thankful to god tonight
[1:57:06] that we have truth i'm so grateful to
[1:57:09] god brother
[1:57:10] that god has come my way if i tell you
[1:57:13] the story of my life eh
[1:57:15] how that god called me i was i was a
[1:57:19] pastor i was
[1:57:20] a church i had a church back in the
[1:57:23] denomination
[1:57:24] and god calls me god walked past
[1:57:28] everybody and he comes to me
[1:57:32] and he presents me a book
[1:57:35] and the name of the book was indictment
[1:57:40] i had to read that book indictment
[1:57:43] and when i read that book i
[1:57:46] threw it behind the wardrobe couldn't
[1:57:49] handle what malachi 4 was saying
[1:57:52] about what i believed and then two days
[1:57:55] down the line i moved the water
[1:57:57] take the book out because there was
[1:58:00] something working within me
[1:58:02] until finally brother god help me
[1:58:06] to accept truth and when i accept the
[1:58:09] truth
[1:58:10] i had to go to my church and tell them
[1:58:13] i've accepted truth
[1:58:15] and i'm baptized in the name of of
[1:58:17] course you know what happened
[1:58:18] they booted me out they booted me out of
[1:58:22] church
[1:58:23] but i want to say tonight to you church
[1:58:27] that when god brother bam says when god
[1:58:30] shows you the picture there is
[1:58:33] nothing else brother that you
[1:58:36] see but that picture
[1:58:40] of who malachi 4 is and what
[1:58:43] he has come to do now
[1:58:46] just for a few minutes can i just speak
[1:58:49] a little bit
[1:58:51] on galatians 4. the bible says now i say
[1:58:55] that the a
[1:58:57] as long as this child does not differ at
[1:58:59] all from a slave
[1:59:01] though he is master of all but he is
[1:59:04] under guardians and stewards
[1:59:07] unto until the time appointed by the
[1:59:09] father
[1:59:10] even so we when we were children were in
[1:59:13] bondage under the elements of the world
[1:59:16] but when the fullness of time had come
[1:59:18] god sent forth his son
[1:59:20] born of a woman born under the law to
[1:59:23] redeem
[1:59:24] those who are under the law that we
[1:59:26] might receive
[1:59:27] the adoption of sons and because you are
[1:59:30] sons
[1:59:32] this didn't make you sons but because
[1:59:35] you are sons god that sent forth the
[1:59:38] spirit
[1:59:39] of his son into your hearts crying
[1:59:42] abafa therefore you are no longer a
[1:59:46] slave but a son
[1:59:48] and if a son then an a of god through
[1:59:51] christ now
[1:59:52] at thy word he says i believe
[1:59:56] we all baptize with the holy spirit and
[1:59:59] brought into the body and then we become
[2:00:02] sons
[2:00:04] but then after suns there's a placing
[2:00:08] of sons or the adoption of sons
[2:00:12] he says a son is born in israel then
[2:00:15] after eight days he was circumcised
[2:00:18] and became an israelite but he was born
[2:00:20] of the father
[2:00:22] and then if that child was given a tutor
[2:00:24] galatians tells us
[2:00:26] that after he was raised to a certain
[2:00:29] age and he became
[2:00:30] faithful to the father's work and
[2:00:32] everything he was a very fine boy
[2:00:35] and was eligible to fall air now brother
[2:00:39] brahm says the father
[2:00:40] didn't know what he would be
[2:00:43] when he was born he might be a gangster
[2:00:47] he might be slothful in his father's
[2:00:49] business
[2:00:50] and god couldn't turn his kingdom and he
[2:00:54] sings
[2:00:54] and his work over to that boy
[2:00:58] but when he has proved to be the right
[2:01:01] boy
[2:01:02] and the tutor which in our case is the
[2:01:05] holy spirit
[2:01:06] that takes word to the father
[2:01:09] and gives a report of what we do
[2:01:13] then if we be found faithful
[2:01:16] for so long like the child was
[2:01:20] then he was taken out in a public square
[2:01:24] and a purple robe was put on him and
[2:01:26] there was a law of adoption
[2:01:29] then that boy was adopted by the same
[2:01:32] father who gave him birth and he was
[2:01:35] brought
[2:01:36] into the family and then he wasn't only
[2:01:39] a
[2:01:39] son but he was heir
[2:01:43] coheir with the father of every position
[2:01:47] he had now church we realize
[2:01:51] as i said earlier that heaven
[2:01:55] is going to release him according
[2:01:58] to acts chapter 3 heavens is containing
[2:02:01] him
[2:02:02] until everything has been restored
[2:02:06] until sonship has been restored
[2:02:10] not what i say
[2:02:13] but what i am and how i live and my
[2:02:18] behavior and my conduct
[2:02:20] because that entitles us to adoption
[2:02:24] how i behave myself how my conduct
[2:02:27] as a son brother bam says that father
[2:02:30] don't know
[2:02:32] if his son is going to be a gangster or
[2:02:34] if he's going to be a roused about
[2:02:37] so what he needs to do he needs to
[2:02:40] and that is what you've been going
[2:02:42] through the bible says brother when
[2:02:44] jesus in the book of mark chapter 1
[2:02:47] when jesus rose out of the water
[2:02:50] and he says and the dove came and
[2:02:52] declared and says
[2:02:54] this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[2:02:57] pleased to dwell
[2:02:58] the bible says then that same holy ghost
[2:03:02] to go up and drove him into the
[2:03:06] wilderness
[2:03:07] that same gentile dove that just
[2:03:11] declared
[2:03:12] this is my beloved son the bible says
[2:03:15] the holy ghost took a whoop
[2:03:17] and drove him to prove his sonship
[2:03:22] because god cannot brother entrust
[2:03:26] that's why malachi 4 said that jesus
[2:03:29] christ
[2:03:30] in every word he had to be tried
[2:03:34] like me and you he was a man
[2:03:39] he couldn't be married he could have had
[2:03:43] a home
[2:03:44] but barbara bam said but he sanctified
[2:03:49] he did it for my sake for your sake
[2:03:53] proved
[2:03:55] by his life that he loved brother that
[2:03:58] we
[2:03:58] are able that's why the bible says he's
[2:04:02] our high priest
[2:04:03] he can be touched with our feelings
[2:04:06] because he knows what me and you are
[2:04:08] going through as we are
[2:04:10] going through our wilderness experiences
[2:04:14] right from the day that you were born
[2:04:16] again baptized with the holy ghost
[2:04:18] the holy ghost drove you into the
[2:04:20] wilderness
[2:04:21] and you have been there ever since
[2:04:25] and one of these days we're going to
[2:04:26] walk out
[2:04:28] and one of these days brother he's going
[2:04:29] to declare this is my son
[2:04:32] he's passed the test he's passed the
[2:04:35] test he's proven himself
[2:04:37] to be the right kind of son he's proven
[2:04:40] himself
[2:04:41] in all his ways that he's busy with a
[2:04:44] father's business
[2:04:47] i'm telling you tonight church might be
[2:04:49] sound like
[2:04:50] fables but i want to say how can god
[2:04:54] now some believe that when they are born
[2:04:58] again
[2:04:59] they're adopted yes the potential
[2:05:03] the seed everything is in you
[2:05:07] every apple that that tree
[2:05:11] is going to bring forth it's in that
[2:05:14] little spring
[2:05:16] and you plant it everything that that
[2:05:19] tree was gonna become was in that little
[2:05:22] spring
[2:05:24] and everything that you are gonna become
[2:05:27] was placed in you by the baptism
[2:05:30] of the holy ghost still a baby
[2:05:35] still struggling to walk falling and
[2:05:38] getting up
[2:05:40] but that seed of the potential
[2:05:44] of who god has ordained you to be
[2:05:48] was in you right then
[2:05:51] now trials come
[2:05:55] now situations arise now is the time of
[2:05:59] testing
[2:06:00] now you have to prove who you
[2:06:04] really are and that's where many fail
[2:06:08] brother brahms is in in a little quote
[2:06:10] i'm going to stop now
[2:06:11] he says many try to
[2:06:14] do john 14 12
[2:06:17] before the reflection of christ
[2:06:21] is in them he says how
[2:06:24] he says and that's the reason so many
[2:06:28] christians ministers are lying he says
[2:06:32] on the sidewalk he says lying on the
[2:06:36] shores of
[2:06:36] life he says they are crumbled
[2:06:40] wrecks because they try
[2:06:44] to produce john 14
[2:06:47] 12 without having the reflection
[2:06:51] of jesus christ in them
[2:06:54] brother this is the hour and the time
[2:06:59] for john 14 12. the whole creation
[2:07:03] is groaning into a veil
[2:07:07] waiting for those sons to be made
[2:07:10] manifest and i'm telling you this is the
[2:07:13] most glorious time
[2:07:15] the most wonderful time when brother
[2:07:18] banham says they will be
[2:07:20] born sons true sons
[2:07:23] full sons they will speak
[2:07:27] and it will flash like lightning brother
[2:07:30] bram
[2:07:31] said she's on the border of it right now
[2:07:35] and that was i think 60 years ago
[2:07:38] so if it does on the board then
[2:07:41] where are we now where are we
[2:07:45] now are you the right kind of son
[2:07:48] or are you rushed about or are you
[2:07:51] against
[2:07:53] what is your qualifications
[2:07:58] i'm challenging you tonight as i had to
[2:08:01] challenge myself
[2:08:03] when god started dealing with my life
[2:08:06] with these things brother
[2:08:08] malachi 4 says man he says how can
[2:08:12] that box call you remember that box cart
[2:08:16] where brother bam says when they park
[2:08:18] back that box cart
[2:08:20] how the inspector comes along and now
[2:08:23] the inspector look
[2:08:25] at the box examine it to see
[2:08:28] if everything was packed tight
[2:08:32] he says because he dare not seal
[2:08:37] that box card unless everything
[2:08:40] is packed in order and i want to say
[2:08:45] god will never adopt me and you
[2:08:50] if my life and your life does not
[2:08:53] line up with a word
[2:08:58] very serious hour a very very serious
[2:09:01] time
[2:09:03] hallelujah that we are living in
[2:09:06] and we need to by the grace of god
[2:09:08] church
[2:09:09] we need to get into that spot
[2:09:14] where he will be able to proudly
[2:09:17] take me aside and visit me with an angel
[2:09:22] and says i have found him to be faithful
[2:09:27] now i give him signing power
[2:09:30] now i give him rights problem says when
[2:09:34] when someone comes and tell you brother

[2:10:23] so embodied with him
[2:10:26] so infused with him

[2:10:34] it's deity speaking that's where we are
[2:10:39] and that's what he's waiting on for us
[2:10:42] to get in order brother ben
