[26:13] Jesus Christ amen please enjoy the
[26:16] comfort of your seats and uh the
[26:19] scripture that we have read tonight you
[26:22] know we we we we we realize that the
[26:25] Lord Jesus Christ is calling he's saying
[26:28] come eh he's saying come if we read the
[26:33] end of that line he also says I will
[26:37] give you rest so he's saying come and
[26:41] then I'll give you rest he will there's
[26:44] something that you must do you must come
[26:47] and then he will give you rest can you
[26:49] see can you see it's not just saying
[26:52] come just find yourself make yourself
[26:54] comfortable no no he will give you rest
[26:57] when you come to my house house and then
[26:59] I say oh come in and I even show you
[27:02] this is your room you'll sleep in this
[27:04] room this is the kitchen can you see I'm

[27:12] snakes everything you see so because now
[27:15] I'm welcoming you the Lord Jesus is not
[27:18] just saying come and not give you rest
[27:20] amen so that's the the spirit of that
[27:23] scripture that we have read because
[27:25] tonight I would like us to talk about
[27:28] God of
[27:30] opportunities H I want us to just for a
[27:33] little bit of
[27:34] time because we have to understand that
[27:39] we need to respect the time that we
[27:41] allocate to come to
[27:43] church because it's a very important
[27:45] thing I mean you have left so many
[27:48] things out there that some of them could
[27:50] have given you probably H more uh
[27:54] Earthly benefits you know they could
[27:57] have benefited you in some way or the
[27:59] other on the flesh but you have left
[28:01] everything because you recognized that
[28:05] tonight you want to be in the presence
[28:07] of God you want to Fellowship so while
[28:10] we are here just allow
[28:13] yourself to take this
[28:16] opportunity to use this opportunity for
[28:19] a little bit and hear a few words then
[28:22] we go home won't that be lovely to be
[28:25] blessed by God just not to lose the
[28:27] opportunity
[28:28] that is why tonight I would like us to
[28:30] talk a little bit about God this God
[28:34] because he's a god of
[28:37] opportun opportunities so my children
[28:40] when I say opportun they say
[28:44] nities to
[28:46] show we on the same page so this this
[28:51] God he's a God who gives
[28:55] opportunities he even he even giv his
[28:58] enemy
[29:01] opportunities he he gave opportunities
[29:03] to his enemy many times all over the
[29:05] Bible so let's just look at him tonight
[29:08] and just recognize wow I didn't see that
[29:12] way he's a god of opportunities the fact
[29:16] that you are here is a great opportunity
[29:19] that you have taken with two hands amen
[29:22] so let's just let's just what what is an
[29:26] opportunity they say it's an this is now
[29:29] Cambridge uh that other dictionary not
[29:32] Oxford mar maram
[29:36] mar but it's called Cambridge inside
[29:38] that that's the dictionary that one I'm
[29:40] talking about that's the
[29:42] explanation the explanation of what
[29:45] opportunity
[29:47] is is a favorable
[29:50] juncture of
[29:52] circumstance it's a juncture a favorable
[29:55] one of a circumstance in other words you
[29:58] are presented or you come across a
[30:02] favorable juncture in your
[30:05] circumstances that is called an
[30:10] opportunity are we together they also
[30:13] say it's a good chance for
[30:15] advancement or progress you know
[30:18] sometimes if we can expand on these
[30:20] things we just think oh I know what an
[30:22] opportunity is no no we we need to to
[30:25] understand um what and
[30:28] opportunity can be because if you don't
[30:32] you can miss
[30:35] it
[30:37] Hallelujah God he he even gave Cain an
[30:42] opportunity
[30:44] remember because he's a god of
[30:47] opportunities he said and the Lord said
[30:49] unto Cain why are thou
[30:53] Roth and why is thy countenance Fallen
[30:58] H why if thou does well shall thou not
[31:04] be
[31:06] accepted that's that's very clear by
[31:09] implication that go what God is telling
[31:12] K what's the guy Kane is that if you do
[31:16] well like your brother you will be
[31:19] accepted my door is
[31:22] open and God knows very well that this
[31:25] guy this guy can't do it he he's not
[31:27] deser designed to do that so he missed
[31:31] that opportunity came he missed it and
[31:35] if thou dust not that's not thou do not
[31:38] well sin lith at the
[31:41] door and unto thee shall be his desire
[31:46] and thou shall Ru shall rule over him so
[31:50] there's a there's a
[31:52] problem when we don't take
[31:55] opportunities because sin could be like
[31:58] around the corner when we take we don't
[32:00] take God's
[32:01] opportunity we lose what he's trying to
[32:04] give us and what is lying around the
[32:07] corner so don't lose it that opportunity
[32:11] let's just continue a little bit I want
[32:13] you to to think
[32:16] about but what about
[32:19] brother when when when when the when is
[32:22] not an opportunity from God you are dead
[32:24] right my brother my sister my friend the
[32:27] devil also can present an
[32:29] opportunity but remember there there's
[32:32] there's two outcomes of these
[32:34] opportunities the enemy can present what
[32:36] looks like an opportunity it's not
[32:38] really an opportunity it's something
[32:40] that is going to hurt you something that
[32:43] is going to harm you something that is
[32:45] going to make you disbelieve God is not
[32:47] an opportunity per
[32:50] se the one from the devil but the one
[32:53] from God has got eternal life that is
[32:56] why we come by faith to take the
[32:59] opportunity from God so which means for
[33:02] you and I to know and to understand we
[33:06] must get a discernment from God he must
[33:10] give us a heart and a spirit of
[33:13] discernment to see that this is the
[33:16] opportunity from my Lord I take it by
[33:18] faith and I go and it shall come to pass
[33:23] amen
[33:24] so I have here I said many time we view
[33:29] problems trials Temptations
[33:32] sickness many forms of suffering threats
[33:36] hunger riches plenty poverty as they are
[33:42] we just view them as those things that
[33:44] I've just read we view them like that
[33:48] but we fail to understand brothers and
[33:50] sisters that those things could be
[33:54] opportunities when when I suddenly start
[33:57] to have a lot of money and I'm a Son of
[34:01] God I can I can start to boast and miss
[34:04] the
[34:05] opportunity I can start to be pompers
[34:07] and miss the opportunity but maybe God
[34:10] was giving me to be a benefit to his
[34:14] economy maybe God was giving me to see
[34:17] whether I'll be like Solomon or
[34:20] not maybe God was giving me to see
[34:23] whether I'll be like Abraham but I
[34:25] missed opportunity because Abraham
[34:27] became but he was still
[34:29] humble I'm told when I read in some of
[34:32] the history um that's not recorded in
[34:35] the Bible I'm not sure if it's I didn't
[34:37] verify it but I was reading a Jewish
[34:39] history they say Abraham he was so rich
[34:43] that he had a guest house you know when
[34:45] pilgrims and strangers come from a far
[34:48] off passing by him just like melkisedek
[34:51] he saw him coming from a far off you
[34:54] know when he those people will come in
[34:56] this get guest house of Abraham and they
[34:58] will dwell for free for Mahala Mahala
[35:01] means free they will stay for free they
[35:04] will be what in the guest house so he
[35:06] was rich but
[35:08] humble so it was a great opportunity for
[35:13] Abraham but when me and you get those
[35:16] things how do we view
[35:19] them
[35:22] sickness you making it very hard now how
[35:25] can sickness you say I must call it an
[35:27] opportunity of course it is an
[35:30] opportunity remember I didn't say the
[35:33] sweet and sour opportunities I just said
[35:36] opportunities God is a god of
[35:39] opportunity bear in mind my brothers and
[35:41] sisters that God has got no problem go
[35:44] God in God's vocabulary there's nothing
[35:46] like oh this is too much of a problem
[35:49] how can I handle this God has got no
[35:51] problems but why is he bringing diseases
[35:54] he allows the devil to bring diseases or
[35:56] tiles to to me because those are
[35:59] problems which means those things are
[36:01] not to a Son of God and a daughter of
[36:04] God those things are
[36:07] opportunities something must come out of
[36:10] me being sick me being poor me being
[36:13] rich me being hurt me being h h h
[36:19] disobeyed me being H you know betrayed
[36:24] me being hated me having having you know
[36:28] everything to a son and a daughter of
[36:30] God if it comes your way is an
[36:34] opportunity that God brings to you amen
[36:38] because
[36:39] look look I don't know why my classes
[36:43] don't want to see sister Talia can I
[36:45] increase this this
[36:47] thing or maybe I should put it like
[36:51] this no I'll leave it this way oh thank
[36:55] you it looks better now
[36:58] thank you
[37:04] sister listen to what James says James
[37:08] chapter 2 James chapter
[37:10] 1 my
[37:12] brethren count it all joy when ye fall
[37:16] into diverse Temptations knowing these
[37:19] that the trying of your faith WTH
[37:23] patience but let patience have her
[37:27] perfect way work that ye may be perfect
[37:30] and and
[37:32] and entire wanting
[37:35] nothing so there you go there you have
[37:38] it my brothers and sisters take it all
[37:41] as Joy when all form of Things Fall unto
[37:45] you because you are special people you
[37:49] see you have to realize that you are a
[37:52] son and a daughter of king of of the
[37:54] king you are not just an ordinary person
[37:57] and that is why you are an odd
[37:59] ball you you're not an ordinary
[38:04] ball a son and a daughter of God does
[38:07] not interpret things the way the world
[38:09] does a son and a daughter of God does
[38:12] not say but why why me why do you choose
[38:15] why this me Jenny why why me no he says
[38:20] Lord thank you for yet another
[38:23] opportunity because David said the Lord
[38:25] is my shepherd
[38:27] though I can walk on the valy of the
[38:29] shadow of death
[38:32] death a Son of God Walk on the valy of
[38:35] the shadow of the that is an opportunity
[38:38] because he walks right there with you
[38:41] you see so anything that comes to you an
[38:45] unbeliever can cry a helpless cry
[38:49] because he doesn't see that he's not
[38:52] predestinated to see a problem as a an
[38:56] opportunity
[38:57] it doesn't
[38:59] matter an opportunity to you but to
[39:03] someone is not an
[39:05] opportunity that is why when the word of
[39:08] God is
[39:09] preached some some it can
[39:12] destroy some it gives
[39:16] life can you see this so we need to be
[39:20] able to
[39:22] discern am I am I pronouncing it right
[39:25] discernment to discern when things
[39:27] happens to us and our attitude towards
[39:31] the things that happens to us will
[39:33] actually determine the outcome the
[39:36] results because you are a son of God you
[39:39] are a daughter of God Amen but the devil
[39:42] always present this those things he
[39:46] present them
[39:48] differently because his main aim is to
[39:50] discredit God and he that's why he
[39:54] discrediting you when you see the devil
[39:56] attacking you
[39:58] you must know that ah he's just
[40:00] confirming that I'm a Son of God he's
[40:03] confirming my
[40:05] opportunities that he wants to show me
[40:07] something different from what God shows
[40:09] me so the devil will present that thing
[40:12] as a problem are we together are you
[40:14] listening to me yes the the devil will
[40:17] present that thing as something
[40:18] different he'll present it as a problem
[40:22] as ah they hate you as ah you are
[40:25] unlucky oh you've got this this you all
[40:28] sorts of
[40:29] things are we together that's how the
[40:32] devil
[40:33] presents
[40:35] his can I say also the
[40:39] devil he he takes
[40:42] opportunities even those ones that don't
[40:44] belong to him because he's a thief you
[40:47] know that he's a thief he's a robber he
[40:50] just want to H to destroy and to to
[40:53] steal so he's actually he's very opport
[40:58] opportunistic the devil very
[41:00] opportunistic if he can see that you are
[41:02] not realizing your opportunity he'll
[41:04] grab it and then he'll change it brings
[41:08] it to you from the oven of Hell changed
[41:12] to you and you believe him so let's let
[41:15] us realize our opportunities and not
[41:17] miss them and not allow them to be in
[41:19] the hands of the devil let's know that
[41:23] who we are the devil cannot determine
[41:26] who you are and me are are we together
[41:30] but God um I mean the devil let me just
[41:34] sit on him for a little bit H he will
[41:37] even blame make you to blame
[41:41] yourself the enemy he'll even make
[41:44] something that was supposed to be an
[41:46] opportunity for you he'll turn it around
[41:50] if you especially if you give him a lot
[41:51] of air time and then he will turn that
[41:54] around for you to blame yourself
[41:58] for you to feel
[42:01] guilty excuse
[42:03] me to feel
[42:06] hurt to feel pain to feel all sorts of
[42:09] things and even blame yourself and blame
[42:11] your brothers and sisters when he's
[42:14] finished with blaming brothers and
[42:15] sisters he make you to blame yourself
[42:18] for
[42:20] what how can God save you for you to
[42:23] blame yourself God the author and
[42:28] finisher and the one who knew you from
[42:31] the beginning he had a plan of your life
[42:34] and everything he saw you so me and you
[42:39] cannot turn around and and say ah I'm so
[42:42] stupid I shouldn't have done
[42:46] that if God allowed it look at it
[42:49] differently it's an
[42:52] opportunity the only thing ask God God
[42:56] how is this going going to be a blessing
[42:57] to me how is this going to be a blessing
[43:01] to my brother to my
[43:02] sister sometimes things happen among
[43:05] us to some of us and we miss the
[43:09] opportunity for me to pray for that
[43:11] person or to love that person more you
[43:13] miss it because the enemy cooked it for
[43:16] you and spiced it and presented to you
[43:18] in a
[43:20] plate and then I received it when it was
[43:24] supposed to be a blessing when it was
[43:26] when it was a Godly opportunity are you
[43:29] are you following me I want to try to be
[43:31] a little bit slow so if God present what
[43:36] clearly looks like a problem to you you
[43:40] must just know that it's actually not a
[43:43] problem it's an
[43:45] opportunity amen let's just look at a
[43:48] few things that uh the things that a
[43:52] people of God will take you know I'm
[43:56] saying here a few common things about
[43:57] people who takes God's opportunities
[43:59] just a few things because I I wrote by
[44:02] faith you you need to take God's
[44:05] Opportunity by
[44:07] faith you you apply Faith did you hear
[44:09] the scripture for James can I read it
[44:12] again where I read where James
[44:16] said James here because this one is a
[44:18] bit small for me my brethren count it
[44:20] all joy when ye fall into diverse
[44:23] Temptations knowing these that the tri
[44:26] of your faith
[44:27] [Music]
[44:28] huh work patience but let patience have
[44:34] her perfect work that he may be perfect
[44:37] and entire wanting
[44:40] nothing so you have to apply faith in
[44:44] every opportunity that God gives you
[44:46] I'll show you examples okay I'll show
[44:49] you examples but before I show you the
[44:51] examples let's just look here some of
[44:54] the things that the people of God people
[44:57] who takes God's opportunities more let's
[45:01] look at what is generally common with
[45:04] those
[45:05] people those people they are ready to go
[45:09] against popular demand or
[45:13] majority they may not go with the
[45:15] majority because straight is the gate
[45:17] and the narrow is the so they they don't
[45:21] necessarily follow the majority because
[45:24] the majority is actually is not is not
[45:26] always right
[45:27] did you know that this whole world uses
[45:30] what they call majority rules in what
[45:32] they call Democratic systems but
[45:34] majority is not always right it's not
[45:36] always right the Bible said it that
[45:39] there's so many the majority is going on
[45:41] the on the other Road the majority so if
[45:44] majority rules then we are in
[45:48] trouble Rob if the majority rules and
[45:52] the many is the is the road of the
[45:55] majority they go through the and we
[45:57] following the majority so don't always
[45:59] follow majority but the point I'm trying
[46:01] to show you is that what is generally
[46:03] common with the people who take God's
[46:05] opportunities they don't always follow
[46:09] majority and they don't follow popular
[46:12] demand what is popular what is
[46:15] trending no we don't go according to
[46:17] what is trending we are looking for
[46:18] God's opportunity what is he
[46:21] saying they also they also prepared to
[46:24] die
[46:27] they're prepared to die to die not even
[46:30] for themselves only but for for their
[46:32] brothers and their sisters they're
[46:34] prepared to die are
[46:37] you are you prepared to die for
[46:42] me I'm prepared to die for you to die so
[46:46] that my brother can live it's a strong
[46:49] statement but you need to do what
[46:51] brother maras taught
[46:53] usanagi he said put on your your SP
[46:56] spiritual jacket H put on your spiritual
[46:59] jacket and understand have a discernment
[47:01] what I'm trying to to show you or to
[47:03] share with you those people are prepared
[47:06] to die they are prepared to
[47:09] die for God's opportunity to take place
[47:12] in their lives you'll see when I give
[47:14] you examples now they are prepared to be
[47:21] criticized because when you are
[47:22] criticized by many that means you're not
[47:25] you may not be popular
[47:27] because there will be narrative that ah
[47:30] this guy is this way this you know so to
[47:33] be criticized is not a nice
[47:37] thing to be
[47:39] criticized but hey it's a wonderful
[47:44] opportunity even some people in the
[47:46] world they can tell you that oh to be
[47:48] criticized helps helps you to
[47:51] grow you know it helps you to be
[47:54] criticized
[47:57] even if you get someone who
[47:59] who H does not criticize you
[48:04] constructively criticize you to to break
[48:07] you brother Kuan he criticize you he
[48:09] just he just find fault with anything
[48:12] like that guy at the hospital there if
[48:14] you if you can see the brother Kuban
[48:16] he'll give you a testimony like that guy
[48:18] at the
[48:20] hospital just for you to come through
[48:22] the door you are already wrong that's
[48:25] how the devil you use me and you
[48:27] yeah so the devil is actually a very
[48:30] important
[48:31] element in my life and your life because
[48:35] it's an instrument that God put in our
[48:38] lives to show who God is to show who we
[48:42] are the
[48:47] devil okay let's just move on so that we
[48:50] can R
[48:52] up they're not afraid to be
[48:55] criticized uh let's just look at a just
[48:58] a few
[48:59] examples of what I'm talking about and
[49:02] and look at a man like
[49:05] Abraham he was given an opportunity when
[49:08] God called
[49:10] him you
[49:12] know God called
[49:14] Abraham Abraham was not worshiping God
[49:18] but God just came to him and gave him
[49:20] this opportunity but Abraham used Faith
[49:24] he just trusted in God against All Odds
[49:27] he just believed God how can you leave
[49:30] now I just wake up in the morning I I
[49:33] said sisteri God said I must just wake
[49:35] up and walk we just go here we going
[49:38] here he says honey that is South Ireland
[49:41] we will pass and get to the South
[49:43] Pole there's no life there I said no God
[49:47] God said I must take my family and go
[49:52] there you think she'll she'll think I'm
[49:55] normal
[49:58] you see so when God speak to you and ask
[50:01] you this is what I want you to do and
[50:05] you hear this is God you connect with
[50:07] him the spirit you descend that you do
[50:12] it amen Our Father Abraham did
[50:18] it let's look at the other another
[50:21] another example three Hebrew boys they
[50:23] were prepared to die in fact they said
[50:26] brother calling they said it's okay even
[50:29] if our God does not save
[50:31] us you see when you come to that point
[50:34] when you come to that point are we
[50:35] together brothers and sisters when when
[50:37] you get to that point where you say even
[50:40] if my God does not heal me I will not
[50:44] obey you Satan you are like you like the
[50:47] three Hebrew
[50:49] boys right so that is the example I was
[50:53] showing you I was telling you earlier on
[50:54] saying that those people are prepared to
[50:57] die let's stop talking amen so so those
[51:02] people they do that and they are
[51:04] prepared to die for God because they
[51:08] don't want to lose this
[51:09] opportunity amen and then there also
[51:13] example of
[51:15] Judas you see
[51:17] Judas
[51:21] Judas he had an opportunity but he
[51:23] missed it because he was predestinated
[51:27] that way he he stood in the presence of
[51:31] God Mama PR he stood there and God even
[51:34] the Lord even said ah one of you is
[51:37] going to betray me even him instead of
[51:40] saying oh Lord me I Repent it's me and
[51:44] be vulnerable and confess and say my
[51:46] father pray for me forgive me I've done
[51:49] this thing in secret now I'm exposed no
[51:51] he didn't do that he still he still
[51:54] connived with him within himself and
[51:56] then
[51:57] but that was an
[51:58] opportunity was it not sister for for me
[52:03] I'll be like brother Bram one day those
[52:05] people who came when he was in Houston
[52:07] Texas you know they came and they said
[52:10] today William bham is going to be
[52:13] exposed he said yeah I I I want to be
[52:16] exposed because if you're exposing
[52:18] something wrong that means there's no
[52:19] God in Me So expose
[52:21] it I want God to expose everything in me
[52:25] that is not of him
[52:27] so it's not actually actually God if he
[52:31] does that he's not exposing you he has
[52:34] exposing the devil who happen to hide
[52:37] like that TI remember many mons ago I
[52:39] told you about that TI the ti that lies
[52:41] there in a a parasite it just like makes
[52:44] himself part of the
[52:46] skin Sometimes some demons can sit like
[52:49] that sister Vanessa and and God is just
[52:51] exposing them and the devil says Ah God
[52:55] is hating you no God is Not hitting you
[52:57] he's just removing that TI which is that
[53:00] TI is like holding it says I'll rather
[53:05] die demon that's how demons behave so
[53:08] when God present an opportunity like the
[53:11] three Hebrew
[53:13] boys take
[53:16] it amen I've written down the list down
[53:20] the Judas missed it Cain missed it what
[53:24] about the four Lio lios liosis those men
[53:27] that were outside of the city huh
[53:29] remember them in the book of kings and
[53:32] they said oh for
[53:35] us those guys are such an inspiration
[53:38] they said you know what there is food
[53:41] there and that's the only thing that's
[53:44] going to make us
[53:46] live because if we sit here we're going
[53:49] to
[53:52] die and even if we go there they kill us
[53:55] we were still going to to
[53:57] die so
[54:00] death there's a word they use in English
[54:02] what do they say it's unavoidable but
[54:05] there's another
[54:07] we you know they knew that they have it
[54:11] this they are prepared to Die James is
[54:14] everything still okay here yeah yeah
[54:17] yeah yeah yeah thank thank you
[54:19] sir the moment you are prepared to die
[54:23] and you let your life go that's when you
[54:25] save it
[54:27] that's actually when you get your life
[54:28] back and plus and and and
[54:33] and in in the in the the young people
[54:36] they say and and and the list is
[54:39] loading you know that language they say
[54:42] it's
[54:45] loading so let's just go to one more
[54:48] slide then we will be finishing soon my
[54:51] time is just gone past 20 past 8 so I'll
[54:55] finish then to have a prayer
[54:58] meeting when there's a trial and a
[55:00] mistake as a child of God that's an
[55:06] opportunity when there's a mistake
[55:08] because you will do
[55:10] mistakes and you will be hurt and you
[55:13] will be
[55:14] tied God is not going to let you let you
[55:18] give the enemy the credit and just let
[55:21] you come
[55:22] easily no God is not like that God does
[55:25] not have a
[55:27] you know those cookie cutters you just
[55:29] cut cut cut cut cut in in in heaven in
[55:31] in
[55:32] no God want us to be tried because he's
[55:36] actually trying part of himself that is
[55:38] that he put in you are you together so
[55:42] so so I'm saying here
[55:44] that when you face a
[55:51] trial take it with patience you view it
[55:54] as an opportunity
[55:57] even if it's a mistake even if it's a
[56:00] mistake that you did it with open eyes
[56:03] that I'm doing this one you see this now
[56:05] now I'm getting into this sin and you
[56:08] get in a Son of God and you get in there
[56:12] and then God Saves
[56:14] you God wants you when you are
[56:17] out and you're washed you're covered
[56:19] with the
[56:21] blood him because he doesn't see that
[56:23] anymore it's as if you have never done
[56:25] it
[56:27] he wants you to look at yourself the way
[56:29] he looks at you did you hear me that's a
[56:33] key learning point God wants you to look
[56:35] at yourself the way he looks at
[56:39] you that's a good point to know
[56:45] there he doesn't want you to look at
[56:47] yourself the way d looks at you because
[56:51] they tomorrow changes and say good boy
[56:53] tomorrow he says what the boy
[56:56] because that is
[56:58] human today you're my good friend
[57:00] tomorrow I say ah
[57:03] mama oh I say ah brother
[57:06] mishak how can of all the people but
[57:09] yesterday I was praising you saying my
[57:11] my fellow African from
[57:14] Kenya ah from Eastern Kenya I'm holding
[57:17] the south of Africa you are holding East

[57:24] say oh no brother Mish you can't do that
[57:25] to me
[57:28] you're acting like my enemies me the
[57:30] same guy but not God once a friend with
[57:34] God he keeps you that way God doesn't
[57:37] change politicians change politicians
[57:41] they make a coalition with this one this
[57:43] year the next elections they win they
[57:45] lose they make a coalition with that one
[57:47] that's how the world works the world he
[57:50] marries this one today he marries that
[57:52] one tomorrow he marries that one or
[57:54] today he loves this girl tomorrow that

[1:00:50] uh does not
[1:00:54] deliberate he says brother bam and I
[1:00:58] wrote a little title I said don't fail
[1:01:00] to take your opportunity don't
[1:01:02] fail grab the opportunity and grab it by
[1:01:06] faith the fact that you are alive you
[1:01:09] are here you are healthy is a great
[1:01:11] opportunity that you found yourself in
[1:01:14] and God called you so you have walked up
[1:01:16] to so far here don't stop now continue
[1:01:20] taking God's promises and opportunities
[1:01:23] as they come to you by faith am amen he
[1:01:27] says and he said now it's like it was a
[1:01:30] funeral or somebody passed away or
[1:01:32] something happened they're saying and he
[1:01:34] said they said brother
[1:01:36] Brenham she's the only one in the bunch
[1:01:40] that's a Christian and he said I guess
[1:01:42] that we we just too mean those people
[1:01:45] are say no no we are just too mean we
[1:01:47] are not much of a Christian like that
[1:01:49] person that's the reason that God's
[1:01:50] asking is taking her from us because we
[1:01:53] are not Christians this are Christians
[1:01:56] talking like
[1:01:58] that that the devil wants you to be mean
[1:02:01] unto yourself that the things that are
[1:02:04] happening what is this he want you he
[1:02:07] he's a guy who's very self-destructive
[1:02:10] and he wants us to be
[1:02:12] self-destructive what did Brother Bram
[1:02:16] say and I seen then the opportunity that
[1:02:21] God had give given me see he saw an
[1:02:25] opportunity
[1:02:27] I see two there I don't know how many
[1:02:29] you see the first opportunity that I see
[1:02:32] is for me to show those people that no
[1:02:34] it's not like that that's the enemy
[1:02:36] making you talk like that the second one
[1:02:39] was the opportunity for them to know
[1:02:42] that the reason why God does things in
[1:02:44] our lives is for his honor and glory is
[1:02:47] doesn't it say so in the Book of
[1:02:50] Ecclesiastes that the whole matter the
[1:02:54] conclusion of the whole matter matter of
[1:02:57] Life the philosophy of
[1:02:59] life is that God can be praised in my
[1:03:03] life that's the whole reason why I
[1:03:07] exist the whole reason why there's
[1:03:10] doctors and
[1:03:13] everything
[1:03:15] sorry let's just focus can s it up
[1:03:20] amen the whole matter
[1:03:25] is that God can get Glory and
[1:03:28] Honor that's the whole
[1:03:31] matter this is an opportunity
[1:03:34] now right now this is an
[1:03:37] opportunity we can see that the enemy is
[1:03:40] not happy I'm sorry about that
[1:03:46] right that was a little challenging
[1:03:50] opportunity but hey you may not see why
[1:03:53] is an opportunity I may not see but I
[1:03:56] know that anything that happens to a son
[1:03:59] and a daughter of God in our lives is an
[1:04:03] opportunity it must bring glory and
[1:04:05] honor to God some way or the
[1:04:07] other
[1:04:14] amen now here brother Bram is talking
[1:04:19] about they said he's talking I'm going
[1:04:23] back to the story of those four lepos
[1:04:25] leprosis
[1:04:26] who were at the gate they said why don't
[1:04:28] we s sit here till we
[1:04:32] die we can go into the
[1:04:35] city there's nothing to eat there they
[1:04:39] were talking about the city where they
[1:04:40] come from there's nothing all people are
[1:04:42] dead there they were starving they were
[1:04:45] eating one another's children and if if
[1:04:49] they you know the story those lios who
[1:04:51] were out of the city in the city there's
[1:04:54] hunger people are dead outside but
[1:04:56] there's an army outside of the enemy
[1:04:59] that is camping there with a big Camp
[1:05:01] there's food and there's everything
[1:05:03] these guys are discussing now the story
[1:05:06] I was telling you at the beginning they
[1:05:08] only had one
[1:05:10] opportunity that was go down to the
[1:05:13] enemy's
[1:05:16] Camp don't be afraid to challenge the
[1:05:19] enemy and take what belongs to you you
[1:05:23] know there's things in our life along
[1:05:24] this journey as we we lose certain
[1:05:27] things and and we are serving a god of
[1:05:31] opportunities that can even be restored
[1:05:34] you know God's opportunities are
[1:05:37] endless God is one examiner who are the
[1:05:40] students here God is one examiner that
