[4:35] God bless you saints. Welcome to the
[4:37] house of the Lord. Let's just stand this
[4:39] evening as we open in a word of prayer.
[4:46] Let's bow our heads. Thank you, Lord,
[4:49] our most gracious heavenly father. Lord,
[4:50] that you've that we could know we're
[4:52] here, Lord Jesus, with you, Lord Jesus,
[4:55] to be able to come and hear from you
[4:56] once again, Lord. And Lord, I pray, Lord
[4:59] Jesus, that you speak to our hearts
[5:00] tonight, Lord. And every need and
[5:02] question we have, Lord Jesus, that you'd
[5:04] answer them, Lord Jesus. And Lord, I
[5:06] just want to pray you be with those that
[5:08] aren't here, Lord, be their portion
[5:09] wherever they are now, Lord. May your
[5:11] atmosphere just surround them, Lord
[5:13] Jesus, powerfully, Lord, and that their
[5:15] lives may be changed as well, Lord, and
[5:17] that they'd be able to rejoice, Lord
[5:18] Jesus, in you, Lord. And the same for us
[5:20] now this evening, Lord. I pray you speak
[5:22] through Jimmy as he comes, Lord. And and
[5:25] as he's prepared, Lord Jesus, to come
[5:26] and speak to your people, Lord. I pray
[5:28] that he just surrender himself, Lord.
[5:30] You use him as a microphone to speak to
[5:32] us, Lord. And that we walk out here,
[5:34] Lord. Lord Jesus, changed, Lord. I pray
[5:37] you be with the music and the musicians,
[5:39] Lord Jesus. I pray that your atmosphere
[5:40] come down, Lord, and just feel welcome
[5:42] in this place, Lord. And Lord, you said
[5:44] where two or three are gathered in your
[5:46] name, you'd be there in the midst, Lord.
[5:47] And we come believing this not, Lord
[5:49] Jesus. And I pray this all in your
[5:51] wonderful name. Amen.

[31:41] Lord, because we love you, Father.
[31:45] Want to give you thanks for all your
[31:46] blessings. Thank you for taking care of
[31:48] our families, Lord. We believe in your
[31:50] promises, Lord.
[31:54] We believe your promise, Lord, that if
[31:56] we believe, our house will be saved.
[31:59] Lord,
[32:01] want to ask you to talk to me through
[32:03] turns, Lord, and to bless your people,
[32:05] Father. want to give you thanks for
[32:07] everything.
[32:09] Be with us tonight. I worship this in
[32:11] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And thank you
[32:15] musicians. Thank you. Um it's always
[32:18] very hard to stand here just for the
[32:21] presence and everything. And I'm South
[32:23] American so I just cry. That's the only
[32:25] thing that I can do.
[32:28] Um,
[32:33] so that was a very fitting song for the
[32:36] subject that we're going to talk tonight
[32:38] is
[32:44] the Passover.
[32:49] We're going to talk how applying the
[32:51] blood you can save. The blood is our
[32:54] token.
[32:57] So we can go to Exodus 12 verse 13.
[33:05] Um and the Bible says, "And the blood
[33:08] shall be to you for a token upon the
[33:10] houses where ye are. And when I see the
[33:13] blood, I will pass over you, and the
[33:15] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[33:17] you when I smite the land of Egypt." You
[33:20] can have your seats.
[33:24] The blood. The blood was always the
[33:27] token. We can see through the Bible. Can
[33:31] you turn me down a little bit here?
[33:33] Sounds echoy.
[33:36] When Adam and Eve they sin,
[33:41] God's answer was the blood of the lamb
[33:43] to cover their sin.
[33:45] We'll see here also Abel got the
[33:48] revelation of the blood because he was
[33:52] part of the seed but not his brother.
[33:55] So if we go back here to Egypt again,
[33:58] the people from um the Hebrews, they
[34:01] were slaves. They were in a condition
[34:03] that they didn't wanted to be. But the
[34:05] Lord told them that they were going to
[34:06] be slaves in a foreign land for 400
[34:09] years.
[34:12] But um
[34:16] God, he always fulfilled his promises
[34:19] and he said that he was going to take
[34:21] them out of a slavery
[34:23] &gt;&gt; with a mighty hand, but he also hardened
[34:26] up the um heart of Pharaoh.
[34:30] Now, Pharaoh is a funny character
[34:32] because he's a type of the world. He was
[34:35] a he was the king of Egypt, the king of
[34:38] the world, the type of the devil, I will
[34:40] say.
[34:42] So when Moses went to talk to him,
[34:45] Pharaoh, he tried to negotiate with him.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; We can we can see here. And Pharaoh
[34:50] called Moses said to him, "Let my people
[34:52] go." And he said, "And Pharaoh called
[34:54] unto Moses and said, "Go ye serve the
[34:57] Lord only. Let your flocks and your
[34:59] heads be stayed. Let your little ones
[35:01] also go with you." That's the same thing
[35:04] that the devil can do to you through
[35:07] reasoning. If you decide to follow
[35:09] Christ, the devil can be there and says,
[35:13] &gt;&gt; "Yeah, you can follow Christ." That's a
[35:14] very good decision, but don't give you
[35:17] 100%.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz you can be one of these weirdos that
[35:20] go to church on Wednesdays and Sundays,
[35:23] and that's that's not ideal for you and
[35:26] your friends. What your friends are
[35:27] going to think about you.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; But Moses said, "Nah, we're not going to
[35:32] leave not even one hoof
[35:34] &gt;&gt; behind. We're going to go
[35:38] But that reasoning is um that Pharaoh
[35:41] had
[35:43] is still here
[35:47] &gt;&gt; and to follow Christ. You can follow
[35:49] Christ but the devil is going to
[35:50] reasoning with you. He say where you
[35:52] going to follow Christ? You're still
[35:54] young. You can you have so much life in
[35:58] front of you. You can still do a little
[36:00] bit of sinning and then you can repent.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; But they were called to do the Exodus.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:09] Now the Passover was when um they had to
[36:14] eat the lamb. It was the whole limb was
[36:17] not just a portion of like in a certain
[36:21] um preparation that you like was just on
[36:25] the fire and with bitter herbs. So that
[36:30] was I would say that was not that
[36:31] pleasant to eat but they were told to do
[36:34] it
[36:36] according to
[36:39] to display the the blood to display the
[36:43] token. They had to fulfill all God's
[36:47] words. They had to obey the word of God.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Was not just kill the lamb,
[36:54] &gt;&gt; apply the blood and don't eat it. They
[36:56] had to go
[36:58] step by step.
[37:04] Um, and you know what the funny thing
[37:06] about that?
[37:08] They were still slaves, but they were
[37:11] celebrating.
[37:12] They were going to take, we're going to
[37:14] be take out of slavery,
[37:16] &gt;&gt; but they dressed up, they eat, they were
[37:20] celebrating because the Lord, he was
[37:22] going to deliver them. Amen.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; You can celebrate in the middle of the
[37:26] test
[37:29] &gt;&gt; because God is more powerful.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Now we have talk Ben talk about little
[37:34] Johnny down the road that died. There's
[37:37] a Johnny.
[37:39] Yes.
[37:42] But let's see from the Egyptians point
[37:44] of view. Right.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Next morning, little um Amen was dead
[37:52] and the father of the house us can um
[37:56] his wife said, "What was different
[37:59] &gt;&gt; between us and them? Our walls were
[38:04] thicker,
[38:05] &gt;&gt; thicker. They were slaves. How comes
[38:08] that our son died?"
[38:11] So I can imagine them going down the
[38:13] road and see the difference.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; What was the only difference
[38:20] was the blood.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; The only difference was was the blood.
[38:25] Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; And they said this is Acts 16 says and
[38:30] they said believe on the Lord Jesus
[38:33] Christ and thou shalt be saved in thy
[38:36] house.
[38:38] So the blood of Jesus Christ, the blood
[38:40] of that lamb was able to protect the
[38:44] whole house.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; When that angel of dead came down and
[38:48] smite all the firstborn,
[38:51] the blood was there as a token.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; I will see the blood and I'll pass over
[38:56] you. Amen.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; And we all know the Exodus took place.
[39:02] Amen.
[39:04] So the revelation of the blood goes
[39:06] through the whole Bible. We see Abel
[39:08] here
[39:09] offering a sacrifice and the Bible calls
[39:13] it an excellent a more excellent
[39:16] sacrifice than Cain
[39:19] and he was counted righteous.
[39:22] But how that revelation got to him?
[39:25] Probably he talked to his dad. Probably
[39:27] that revelation just came to him because
[39:29] he was part of the seed. But the truth
[39:32] is that he was able to offer the right
[39:34] sacrifice.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Not Cain.
[39:38] Cain probably he thought, well, I'm
[39:40] going to give my best. I have watered
[39:42] this plants and now I have all these
[39:44] nice crops. This looks way better
[39:49] than that lamb that is dying there. But
[39:53] that was not what God wanted.
[39:57] And we also see here Rahab,
[40:00] she also applied a token that was told
[40:05] to her to apply and go to Joshua 2 and
[40:09] says, "Behold, when we come into the
[40:11] land, thou shalt bind this line of
[40:14] scarlet thread in the window which thou
[40:17] did lead us down by, and thou shalt
[40:19] bring thy father and thy mother, and thy
[40:21] brethren, and all the father household
[40:24] home unto thee.
[40:26] was for the whole family just feed the
[40:28] most
[40:30] and apply the token
[40:33] and we know that she believed and that's
[40:36] what happened she got saved and he and
[40:39] everyone who was in in her house now
[40:43] this is brother Brandham saying the
[40:44] token is a sign the purchase has been
[40:47] made for us full obedience to the full
[40:51] word of God entitled us to the token no
[40:54] other way is there that you can ever be
[40:57] entitled to the token until you fully
[40:59] obey the word. Not what somebody put
[41:02] into it and added it to it, but what God
[41:06] said about it.
[41:08] We know now that the token is not the
[41:12] actual blood. Now it's the Holy Ghost
[41:14] living in you and me.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; And this is one of this beautiful
[41:21] parallels that the Bible has. This is
[41:24] Jesus when for the last supper
[41:29] he says and when he had given thanks he
[41:33] break it and said take it eat this is my
[41:37] body which is broken for you
[41:40] this to do in remembrance of me. After
[41:42] the same manner also he took the cup
[41:44] when he had Sabbath Sabbath saying this
[41:48] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[41:52] This yei as of as you drink it in
[41:55] remembrance of me. You and you all
[41:57] English always had to trick me.
[42:01] Hi Bruce
[42:05] what they were doing. Jesus there was no
[42:08] cross yet but they were celebrating
[42:10] celebrating victory.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Something was about to take place. Yeah.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; And that's that's a parallelism that is
[42:18] beautiful that we can just
[42:21] rest
[42:22] &gt;&gt; in the Lord
[42:23] &gt;&gt; because he has the victory.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Same thing here.
[42:29] Middle of the storm,
[42:31] &gt;&gt; but we Jesus is in our same boat.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; We can just rest in him.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:39] Daniel in the middle of the trouble man
[42:41] that oh boy surrounded by lions
[42:45] but he had that faith that his God was
[42:49] more than able to deliver him.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; That's what happened.
[42:54] Paul and Silas
[42:57] in prison
[43:00] and singing rejoicing.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; They knew that the Lord was more
[43:05] powerful. Amen.
[43:08] Um
[43:10] Hebrews 10 says, "For by one offering he
[43:14] had perfect perfected forever them that
[43:17] year um that they are sanctified. Where
[43:20] of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to
[43:22] us to for after that he had said before.
[43:27] This is the covenant that I will make
[43:29] with them after those days, says the
[43:31] Lord. I would put my laws into their
[43:34] hearts and in their minds will I write
[43:37] them and their sins and iniquities will
[43:40] I remember no more.
[43:43] Now where remission of this is, there is
[43:46] no more offering for sin. Having
[43:48] therefore, brethren, boldness to enter
[43:51] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.
[43:56] one sacrifice.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; The blood through the whole Bible
[44:00] &gt;&gt; has been more than powerful.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; But the blood of animals, they were just
[44:05] able to cover the sin.
[44:07] The blood of Jesus Christ was able to
[44:09] totally disintegrate that sin.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; There's no more sin. It's nothing. So we
[44:17] can enter into the presence of God
[44:19] through his blood.
[44:22] Now, there's this
[44:26] this verse
[44:28] um I I watched a little clip about it.
[44:30] It's actually quite nice. It says, "And
[44:33] he shall sit as a refiner and purifier
[44:37] of silver, and he shall purify the son
[44:40] of Levi and purge them as gold and
[44:42] silver that they may offer unto the Lord
[44:45] an offering in righteousness."
[44:48] So, I watched this video. There was this
[44:51] group of people that they were wondering
[44:53] why this is he is going to sit like a
[44:56] silver smmith you know like just to
[44:59] purify us.
[45:01] So they went to this um silver smmith
[45:04] and they saw all the process of how the
[45:06] uh silver get um refined.
[45:11] So they have to burn it and when the
[45:13] silver bends it just in this liquid form
[45:15] that you can pull all the impurities and
[45:18] stuff and the lady one of the ladies
[45:21] said to the guy how do you know when the
[45:24] the silver is ready and the guy he just
[45:27] laughed and said what I can see my
[45:29] reflect in the silver.
[45:32] So all the test that we can go through
[45:36] is just that we can reflect him.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; And it's hard man. It's just sometimes
[45:42] it's just very hard.
[45:44] But we are in his hands. Amen.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Now
[45:53] we know there has been three um two
[45:55] exodus already, right? The first one
[45:58] took the people of um Israel out of
[46:00] Egypt to the promised land. The second
[46:03] one took the people from the law to the
[46:05] grace with the blood of Jesus Christ.
[46:07] And after exoduses
[46:10] from denomination to the rest of the
[46:12] Holy Ghost and out of this world to the
[46:14] millennium, right? Amen.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; But in according to do the thing, the
[46:21] only thing that's going to entitle us to
[46:24] the token is just the full obedience to
[46:27] the word of God.
[46:31] Full obedience.
[46:35] I think it's quite nice that all also
[46:38] another
[46:40] um I'm going to say parallelism a lot of
[46:42] time
[46:44] when um John saw um when he's uh in the
[46:48] revelation book the angel told him eat
[46:51] the book the whole book and it's going
[46:55] to be so nice in your mouth but it's
[46:57] going to be so bitter in your stomach
[47:00] it's just when you know the revelation
[47:03] oh man, beautiful.
[47:07] But you have to live word by word.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; And that's the only thing that's going
[47:11] to entitle us to the token.
[47:15] And if we can apply the token, brother
[47:18] Brandham in the message, the token also
[47:20] says that we can apply the token for our
[47:22] families. We can have the faith that
[47:25] they can be saved. And we today is a
[47:27] prayer meeting and I'm pretty much done.
[47:30] This is me. You know me.
[47:33] If we can pray for our families that
[47:36] they're going to be saved,
[47:38] &gt;&gt; it's not it's not because of us. It's
[47:41] not because of Jimmy. He's praying for
[47:43] his family back home. I'm no one.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; But I trust that that blood
[47:49] &gt;&gt; can redeem them.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Something beautiful. It's like years ago
[47:54] my parents, they were praying for me
[47:56] &gt;&gt; because I was a total disaster, man. I
[48:00] was in the world. while I was doing
[48:01] drugs. I was just a mess.
[48:06] I'm a miracle.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; The Lord brought me here, changed my
[48:10] life.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm praying for my parents because I
[48:14] want them to be in the place that I am.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Not physically,
[48:19] but in sitting in high places with
[48:23] Christ Jesus. that place that you can
[48:25] sit
[48:26] &gt;&gt; and rest
[48:27] &gt;&gt; because you know that he's in control of
[48:30] everything
[48:32] and like the refiner fire the refiner um
[48:38] it's not going to be easy
[48:41] no one likes to get banned man
[48:45] but he has to purify us so we can
[48:48] reflect his life
[48:49] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said there's no there
[48:51] hasn't been any other age
[48:55] when we have to show that we are
[48:57] Christians because the lamb was
[49:01] sacrificed at midnight right at the in
[49:04] that time he says that this is the mid
[49:07] time like the midnight time we at the
[49:09] end we're in the end time
[49:13] we have to show that we are Christians
[49:16] but showing that you're a Christian and
[49:18] not just telling people that you're
[49:20] Christian and then just swearing run
[49:22] down the road and
[49:24] he's living a life living the full life.
[49:33] I met this brother um Christ Church his
[49:35] name is um brother um Roberto Gonzalez
[49:38] who's Filipino.
[49:41] I have never hear him preach. He he
[49:44] doesn't preach but his life is a living
[49:47] testimony. Every time that I see him,
[49:50] I'm like,
[49:52] how someone can have so much love, man.
[49:54] I just see his face and his family and
[49:57] it's just
[49:59] I can see Jesus there. also remember
[50:02] when um when I was about to come here, I
[50:05] was doing really bad back home
[50:10] and um I was able to see Jesus in my dad
[50:14] cuz my well I'm not going to talk bad
[50:17] about my mom but my mom is more of like
[50:20] why would you do that and and stuff but
[50:23] my dad he was crying he told me
[50:25] something that it just me. He said,
[50:28] "What can I do to help you?
[50:31] What can I do to help you, son?"
[50:39] And after that took the plane, just
[50:42] prayed to the Lord and he just changed
[50:44] my life.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; But I think that's the most important
[50:49] thing. And if you can take something for
[50:51] um tonight, just let's live a life that
[50:57] the people can see Christ living in you,
[51:00] Christ living in me.
[51:03] And sometimes
[51:04] can be hard. Let's just have the
[51:06] musicians. We're going to pray, too.
[51:11] But we know that
[51:14] him is not going to stop.
[51:17] He has to purify you because he
[51:19] purchases you. You are part of him and
[51:22] he's not going to leave you, not forsake
[51:25] you. And he has to do a job.
[51:29] He has to make you clean cuz he want to
[51:32] take you, right? Take you for the
[51:34] rapture.
[51:36] Let's just stand and pray.
[51:43] Can Can we sing? Um, thank you, Jesus.
[51:48] Almighty God, we want to give you thanks
[51:52] because you are our God. You are our
[51:53] dead
[51:55] and you are every time that we need you,
[51:57] Father. We count with you.
[52:03] We love you so much, Lord. Thank you for
[52:06] provide for us, Lord. A way.
[52:09] Thank you for provide Lord a way to
[52:12] contact you again Lord through the blood
[52:14] of our Lord Jesus Christ. We want to
[52:17] give you thanks father
[52:20] for every time
[52:23] that you have been there for us. Every
[52:26] time that we are on the road Lord and
[52:27] you protect us for every accident Lord.
[52:32] Every time that you
[52:36] give us love, Lord, when no one was
[52:38] there, Father, you have been always
[52:40] there for us.
[52:43] Want to give you thanks and we want to
[52:45] ask you to be for the with us for the
[52:47] rest of the meeting. Lord, we're going
[52:49] to keep praying. Father, there's so much
[52:51] need, Lord.
[52:55] Some of our sisters are sick, Lord.
[52:58] But we can sing victory, Lord. We can
[53:02] claim our victory, Father, cuz we know
[53:04] that you are the doctor, Lord.
[53:07] You are our dad, Lord.
[53:12] Thank you, Father. We want to ask you
[53:14] this in the name of our Lord Jesus
[53:16] Christ. Amen.
