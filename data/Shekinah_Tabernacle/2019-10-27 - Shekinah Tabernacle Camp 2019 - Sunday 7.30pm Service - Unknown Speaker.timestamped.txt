[1:03:02] I love this chapter this is an adoption
[1:03:05] chapter hallelujah room is eight unless
[1:03:14] starry never 16 the Bible says the
[1:03:19] spirit itself bill witness with our
[1:03:21] spirit that we are the children of God
[1:03:23] and if children then heirs heirs of God
[1:03:27] and joint-heirs with Christ
[1:03:29] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:03:33] may also be glorified together he made a
[1:03:37] lot of bless read of his word you can
[1:03:39] have your seats tonight by the grace of
[1:03:49] God tonight I want to use for a subject
[1:03:53] spiritual examination spiritual
[1:03:57] examination you know this this weekend
[1:04:01] there's been a lot of word preached amen
[1:04:04] and there's been a lot of spirit flowing
[1:04:07] amen but we want to examine ourselves in
[1:04:12] these last moments of the meeting amen
[1:04:14] and I want you to ask yourself am i
[1:04:17] healthy amen
[1:04:19] am i spiritually healthy you know in my
[1:04:23] Fit am I fit to run on with Jesus Christ
[1:04:27] is everything about my body everything
[1:04:31] taken everything operating like you're
[1:04:33] supposed to now I'm talking about your
[1:04:36] spirit man I'm not talking about just
[1:04:39] your natural flesh so what I'm going to
[1:04:42] be talking about is natural types but
[1:04:45] for the spiritual being now we know that
[1:04:48] God is a spirit and if we get anything
[1:04:52] out of the Lord it must come from a
[1:04:55] spiritual realm a man but you know there
[1:04:58] was a man leave his neighbor's brother
[1:05:02] down remember brother Chao but the dad
[1:05:06] was a very old Saint that was in the
[1:05:09] time of the Prophet and brother Tao had
[1:05:11] different occasions where he almost died
[1:05:15] and you know um the Prophet told him one
[1:05:19] day you know he was he was he was very
[1:05:22] sick at the point of death and God gave
[1:05:25] him a vision and he told him I'm gonna
[1:05:28] see you again and I'm gonna shake your
[1:05:30] hand and you know that day came to pass
[1:05:35] and brother Dow had a question he began
[1:05:39] to extra prophet he said he said am I am
[1:05:42] i healthy when I make it and the Prophet
[1:05:45] said well let's give you a soul of
[1:05:48] spiritual examination he said according
[1:05:53] to the Word of God let's give you a soul
[1:05:56] and spiritual examination he said see he
[1:05:59] said in God for the soul only has one
[1:06:03] instrument that's right that's his word
[1:06:08] we examine ourselves by the Word of God
[1:06:12] huh
[1:06:15] he says that's his word in Jesus and in
[1:06:22] st. John 5:24 Scripture we just read he
[1:06:25] that hears my word
[1:06:27] now that here doesn't mean listen a
[1:06:33] noise that here means to receive so
[1:06:39] let's examine yourself oh the word that
[1:06:43] you've been hearing hallelujah it tells
[1:06:46] whether or not your body spiritual body
[1:06:49] is healthy on whether you received it or
[1:06:52] not so there's been a lot of things
[1:06:56] going on a lot of us have been in church
[1:06:59] a long time but are you healthy
[1:07:02] are you receiving the word or are you
[1:07:06] just going through all the dynamics we
[1:07:10] need more than just dynamics oh yeah we
[1:07:13] need mechanics also honey we need to
[1:07:16] know what God said and how to operate in
[1:07:20] it we need yes I love to dance I love to
[1:07:24] shout but I dance and shout because I
[1:07:26] know what I'm talking about
[1:07:28] [Applause]
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:35] because let's understand there was a lot
[1:07:38] of people that walked with Jesus that
[1:07:41] had dynamics holy Judas walk with the
[1:07:46] Lord holy in the Bible says he was the
[1:07:49] treasurer God then a devil keep the
[1:07:55] money see he wasn't afraid of any kind
[1:08:04] of situation God look look at how God
[1:08:09] treated his enemy honey God knew he was
[1:08:13] the one that was gonna portray him but
[1:08:16] God gave him a position in church to
[1:08:18] make him feel welcome
[1:08:22] he's nothing like us but somebody do you
[1:08:27] wrong you avoid them you go to the
[1:08:30] opposite direction when you see him you
[1:08:33] start treating them different look Jesus
[1:08:36] he said he said he said I've chosen you
[1:08:38] twelve and one of you is a devil jesus
[1:08:41] never told the rest of his disciples
[1:08:43] that Judas was a devil why because he
[1:08:51] didn't want to put the rest of the
[1:08:52] church in a mind battle so he kept the
[1:08:56] atmosphere healthy you know sometimes
[1:09:01] and we're gonna get into this sometimes
[1:09:04] God will allow you to see things in
[1:09:07] other people's life he'll allow you to
[1:09:09] see the different failures and different
[1:09:11] things just to see how you're gonna
[1:09:13] treat that person are you healthy to
[1:09:20] love like God loved and in Jesus His
[1:09:26] atmosphere was so healthy that he could
[1:09:29] let Judas betray him with a kiss
[1:09:35] how many of you let your enemies get
[1:09:37] that close I know y'all thinking this
[1:09:48] was the last service man I thought was
[1:09:51] go shout our way out of here
[1:09:52] oh we are we are because when you got
[1:09:59] substance
[1:10:00] you can shout oh yeah well you got
[1:10:03] something holding you look ain't none of
[1:10:05] us keeping ourselves this Jesus keeping
[1:10:09] us partying you say hello I got a hold
[1:10:15] on God let me correct you know he got a
[1:10:18] hold on you listen he says that here
[1:10:30] doesn't mean the noise it means to
[1:10:33] receive

[1:18:09] operated higher with gifts and different
[1:18:11] things he healed the sick he raised the
[1:18:13] dead he had holy spirit but when it was
[1:18:16] time to go to Pillar house but it was
[1:18:21] time to go to Pentecost and it was time
[1:18:24] for his nature to be changed he couldn't

[1:32:44] problem with heaven because this is the
[1:32:48] quietest place that you'll ever be
[1:32:55] this is the quietest place you ever be
[1:32:59] can you foresee worshiping the Lord for

[1:34:05] touchy there's gonna be people there who
[1:34:09] will be headed and they gonna look at

[1:34:22] to be quiet
[1:34:24] you don't say that person to sit down
[1:34:26] there's gonna be people that will burn
[1:34:28] at the stake and they're gonna look at
[1:34:32] themselves and they're gonna say look at
[1:34:35] me I can't be touched
[1:34:43] oh that's why I don't go to youth
[1:34:57] meetings because it's such a big show of
[1:34:59] emotion right I hope you don't really
[1:35:05] think like that cuz it's gonna be a
[1:35:08] youth meeting that's gonna shake the
[1:35:09] balls in Ephesians in Ephesians the
[1:35:15] Bible says when the graves cracking when
[1:35:18] the graves come open in the sky crack
[1:35:20] and will be changed in a moment of what
[1:35:22] we live in I all of us will be used
