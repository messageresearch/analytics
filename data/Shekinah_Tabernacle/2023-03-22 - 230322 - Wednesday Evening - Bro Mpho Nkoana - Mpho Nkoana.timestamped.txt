[35:31] we are going to speak about
[35:34] the kingdom of god sister maggie was was
[35:38] the likey one the blessed one all
[35:40] blessed but you read the verse that is
[35:41] our title tonight
[35:43] our title tonight i would like us to
[35:45] talk about uh
[35:47] something that we know but we often are
[35:50] not don't zoom into it it says thy
[35:52] kingdom come
[35:54] now that's our title tonight thy kingdom
[35:57] come that is the verse 10 part of verse
[36:00] 10 says thy kingdom come
[36:02] so you will notice brothers and sisters
[36:04] that that verse
[36:06] and
[36:07] that that that word kingdom in the
[36:09] lord's prayer it comes twice am i right
[36:12] don't invest 13 it says and lead us not
[36:15] into temptation but deliver us from evil
[36:18] for thine is there
[36:21] for thine is the kingdom so it comes for
[36:22] the second time it may not be the only
[36:24] way that comes twice or thrice but
[36:27] that's what stands out for me tonight
[36:29] that it says for thine is the kingdom
[36:31] that kingdom that we are saying
[36:33] thy kingdom come
[36:36] is coming again down in verse 13. the
[36:38] question may be
[36:40] if the kingdom must come where must it
[36:42] come
[36:43] where must it go to where must if we
[36:46] sing in the lord's prayer every day if
[36:48] you are praying the lord's prayer you
[36:49] say thy kingdom come where must it go
[36:52] where must it come to
[36:54] huh and i want to provoke our thoughts
[36:57] tonight to provoke and um if i can
[37:00] pierce your hearts with the word of god
[37:03] tonight along the thought that says thy
[37:05] kingdom
[37:06] come and we'll just expand it and maybe
[37:10] read um
[37:12] another scripture which is matthew 12
[37:16] and you'll see where i'm trying to go
[37:18] we'll read matthew 12
[37:21] and uh verse 22
[37:24] praying that you can
[37:26] the lord will just help us
[37:28] all of us as we
[37:30] just want to relax in the presence of
[37:32] the lord amen
[37:33] amen are you happy
[37:35] are you only here
[37:37] amen
[37:37] [Music]
[37:38] verse 22 the bible reads this
[37:41] and then was brought unto him one
[37:44] possessed with a devil
[37:46] blind and damp and he healed him in so
[37:50] much that the blind and dumb both spake
[37:54] and so
[37:55] are we together we're going to read it
[37:57] from 22 to 28.
[38:00] and all the people were amazed and said
[38:03] is not this the son of david
[38:07] but when the pharisees heard it they
[38:10] said this fellow that not cast out
[38:13] devils but but by belize above the
[38:16] prince of devils
[38:18] now something to think about they they
[38:21] saw and they heard him about him casting
[38:24] devils dumb speak dumb dumb
[38:26] speaking right
[38:29] the dumb speaking and the blind sea they
[38:32] saw
[38:33] but now all they could say the pharisees
[38:35] was this man cast out those devils
[38:39] using belizabe and remember who belle
[38:41] zaba was belzebab was the prince of
[38:45] denver's
[38:47] noted
[38:48] and jesus knew their thoughts
[38:51] and said unto them
[38:53] every kingdom divided against itself
[38:56] brought to desolation
[38:59] he's saying to them hey
[39:00] it's okay for you to accuse me that i'm
[39:03] casting these demons
[39:05] with a bigger demon
[39:07] but the question i'm sending to you the
[39:09] lesson i'm giving to you is that every
[39:12] demon huh i mean every kingdom
[39:16] that is divided against itself surrender
[39:19] into desolation it will fall
[39:23] right
[39:24] every city or house
[39:28] divided against itself shall not stand
[39:31] that's what the lord is saying to them
[39:32] he said okay faith that's fine you may
[39:35] be in your own minds thinking that you
[39:37] are right but listen
[39:39] if
[39:39] you are saying i am belsabab
[39:42] and i'm you saw me casting the devils
[39:45] out
[39:46] huh what should that make them to think
[39:49] how can this man being a devil
[39:52] cast out devils because otherwise the
[39:54] kingdom of the devil will fall
[39:57] the kingdom of the devil will be
[39:58] destroyed
[39:59] that means if this man cast out demons
[40:03] then
[40:04] he is not a demon
[40:06] let's hold it there
[40:08] the issue here is about the kingdom
[40:11] almost everything on earth today is
[40:13] talking about a kingdom it's about the
[40:15] kingdom kingdom i want you to think
[40:17] about government you know in our day
[40:20] today's language government kingdom
[40:23] everything you know is managed under a
[40:25] certain kingdom a certain power a
[40:28] certain system
[40:30] that's what i want you to think along
[40:31] those lines they saw this the lord jesus
[40:34] casting the demons out and they've got
[40:36] clear evidence that they they
[40:38] experienced the evidence they saw it
[40:42] and they say he's a demon
[40:45] how can that be
[40:47] how will that make strengthen the
[40:48] kingdom of the devil
[40:51] right let's continue where was i
[40:54] verse 20
[40:56] 5 energy we already read that one let's
[40:59] go to 26.
[41:01] and if satan casts out satan that's the
[41:03] question
[41:04] he is divided against himself
[41:08] now that's a common sense isn't it but
[41:10] you see revelation doesn't use common
[41:12] sense
[41:14] revelation those guys like revelation
[41:18] they did not have it they could not see
[41:20] something that is glaring that is so
[41:22] clear
[41:24] right
[41:25] if satan casts out satan he is divided
[41:28] against himself how shall then this kill
[41:31] his kingdom stand
[41:32] and if i by balance above cast out
[41:35] devils by whom do your children cast
[41:38] them out
[41:41] therefore they shall be your judges
[41:44] but if i cast out devils by the spirit
[41:47] of god then the kingdom of god is come
[41:50] unto you
[41:52] the kingdom
[41:54] now i want us to think like this what is
[41:57] a kingdom what is a government let's
[41:59] just have a chat what is the government
[42:01] what is it what is a kingdom
[42:04] you see a a government or a kingdom is a
[42:07] system that is made to it's a system of
[42:10] control
[42:11] of managing
[42:12] we make a system to manage things or to
[42:15] control or to coordinate or to lead
[42:19] we make a system that is now called a
[42:22] government in today's today's language a
[42:24] government is now you know we've got the
[42:26] different ministries the ministry of
[42:28] health the minister of education the
[42:30] ministry of social you know we've got
[42:32] the um
[42:34] parliament and we've got the courts the
[42:36] judiciary you know and then we've got
[42:39] different institutions we've got
[42:40] different agencies you know that that
[42:43] belongs to government all those things
[42:45] together they form what you call a
[42:47] government
[42:48] they form a kingdom if you like so all
[42:52] of them each and everyone is supposed to
[42:55] work with another agency in harmony
[42:58] they are supposed to work together
[43:00] there's no one there's no one who's
[43:03] going to be doing this and another one
[43:05] fires him and do something different no
[43:07] no every department every ministry every
[43:11] government agency everybody or organ
[43:14] work with another organ in harmony
[43:17] otherwise the kingdom will
[43:20] fall
[43:20] so that is what the government is right
[43:23] now there's different agencies and
[43:25] organs and then each and every one of
[43:27] them they've got links you know so
[43:29] another one that's up to here another
[43:31] one takes over if another one that does
[43:33] for up to here another one now social
[43:35] development they'll give the benefits
[43:37] and they'll give study link and they'll
[43:39] give our elderly people their money
[43:41] right and then and another one
[43:45] mb
[43:46] will will then provide them where under
[43:48] acc will give if someone gets injured we
[43:51] pay them your own fund another one on
[43:53] the sec giving people money for it for
[43:55] being injured and another agency also
[43:57] giving money for the same thing
[43:58] otherwise they are not working in colu
[44:00] they are contradicting each other right
[44:03] you won't find the department of doing
[44:05] driver's license competing with another
[44:08] one no no they work together even the
[44:10] documents that are issued correspond
[44:12] with one another that is the thinking
[44:14] about the whole idea of a kingdom
[44:17] working together in harmony to achieve a
[44:20] certain goal right
[44:23] now
[44:25] it can they cannot contradict one
[44:26] another otherwise the kingdom falls and
[44:29] that's the message i was trying to say
[44:30] so there's different types of
[44:31] governments and some are called some
[44:34] government is called an only an
[44:36] oligarchy
[44:37] have you heard of that word and
[44:39] oligarchy and oligarchy is a government
[44:42] where
[44:43] um few people control just a few people
[44:47] they are in charge
[44:49] that's a few group of people they are in
[44:52] control
[44:53] then they form a government the whole
[44:54] country of five million people or
[44:56] whatever number they are interested
[45:00] they are called what you call an
[45:01] oligarchy government another type of
[45:03] government is a monarch
[45:05] which is more like ours our we are what
[45:08] we are a constitutional monarch right we
[45:10] are led by the queen is the queen is the
[45:12] head of government the head of state in
[45:14] new zealand right although some people
[45:17] combines some of these types of
[45:19] government you can have a hybrid type
[45:21] model right so we are a monarch we have
[45:23] control the queen can you know can is
[45:26] the head of the state is the head of
[45:28] government she can come and dissolve
[45:30] government
[45:31] right so that is a monarch one person
[45:35] in church
[45:36] thank you one person being the monarch
[45:39] and that can be a monarch in the
[45:41] entrance in the family
[45:44] right that is another form of government
[45:46] back where i come from there's also
[45:48] kings
[45:49] there's a little country on the on the
[45:51] corner of south africa next to
[45:52] mozambique it's called eswatin or
[45:54] swaziland it's still ruled by a monarch
[45:56] the the king thinks in the morning that
[45:58] today there's no more parliament
[46:01] or appoints parliamentarians and
[46:02] ministers you see because they are not a
[46:05] constitutional monarch they are not the
[46:07] democratic sort of monarch and then you
[46:09] have another type of government called a
[46:11] democrat democracy this is the one that
[46:13] we are more used to democracy you see so
[46:16] that one this is a government where uh
[46:19] all adults you know everybody tends to
[46:21] have an opportunity to decide who should
[46:25] govern who should form part of the
[46:27] government so people elect the
[46:28] representative and then those
[46:31] representative becomes mps
[46:33] and then um
[46:35] hip kings mr hipkins is our local mp
[46:37] here in rimutaka and then each and every
[46:39] area elect an mp then they go there to
[46:42] be hive then they represent us to form a
[46:45] government but in a democracy we
[46:48] nominated them to form a government but
[46:50] all these things that i'm explaining to
[46:52] you are called types of governments
[46:54] right
[46:55] we know that all those governments the
[46:57] devil offered them to the lord
[47:00] they are he's he controls them
[47:02] there's nothing like this one is better
[47:04] than that one no no that's just to
[47:06] confuse mankind all of them
[47:09] same children of the same mother
[47:12] right with their prayers with their
[47:14] corns but there's one government that i
[47:17] want i want you to know to note here
[47:19] it's called a messianic a messianic
[47:21] government
[47:22] it's called a messianic kingdom oh yes
[47:25] right also that one
[47:28] it has got members are we together
[47:31] but that one
[47:32] the prophet says that one
[47:34] uh is a is is a mystic body
[47:39] it's a universal mystic body what's the
[47:41] meaning somebody could have can google
[47:43] so they were in church you can't google
[47:45] what's the meaning of the word mystic
[47:47] it's a mystic body to which christ is
[47:50] the head it's a body
[47:54] where christ is the head
[47:56] right and it is ruled by love
[48:00] you walk in the spirit in that
[48:01] government you see it's also another
[48:04] system but it says it's a heavenly
[48:07] system that one that is another
[48:08] government our government
[48:10] are we together
[48:12] so that is that is the background of
[48:14] what a kingdom or a government is are we
[48:17] understanding it so today we are going
[48:19] to do more teaching more preaching just
[48:22] just just to hybrid not hybrid but just
[48:25] to mix it up a bit
[48:27] that's a bad way
[48:30] we don't want to hybrid it but just if i
[48:32] teach or go slow just follow me come
[48:35] with me but if i start to be
[48:37] energized and i start to be noisy also
[48:39] please follow me amen i appreciate that
[48:41] you made time to come to church amen
[48:44] now we have read about
[48:47] uh when they were accusing the lord that
[48:50] he is blessed about and now we also
[48:52] understand
[48:54] what the government or the kingdom is
[48:55] are we together now we can see that a
[48:58] government must work together in harmony
[49:00] and we understand that the government
[49:02] cannot work against itself if it was to
[49:04] achieve his goal amen now let's i want
[49:07] to to bring it to you that uh
[49:11] what did i do now i want to bring it to
[49:12] you here and say
[49:14] i want to to zoom more at an individual
[49:17] level
[49:19] why i want to zoom into an individual
[49:21] level as much as the government as a
[49:23] system is working together
[49:25] us as a body
[49:27] as a body we are like a kingdom right
[49:30] but you as a person as an individual as
[49:33] an individual
[49:34] you're also just like a little
[49:36] government
[49:37] there's a kingdom
[49:40] the head of it is brother ben's head
[49:42] he's got a body
[49:44] right it's a cup it's a system it's
[49:47] a certain way which is controlled and
[49:49] i'll show you how why i'm saying this if
[49:51] you think of it
[49:53] taking our previous example and you
[49:55] think about a body of a person huh
[49:58] if a body of a person can work against
[50:00] each other it has a problem
[50:03] if one part can start that is why a body
[50:06] now if it gets sick it is because there
[50:08] are some soldiers in the body that are
[50:10] fighting there's good soldiers there's
[50:13] best soldiers that that came and then
[50:16] like like russia they went into ukraine
[50:18] of my body and they bought they're
[50:20] trying to bomb and bomb now the ukraine
[50:23] of my body soldiers are fighting back
[50:26] i'm just using that as an example
[50:27] because there's a current war going on
[50:29] right now the good soldiers and the bad
[50:31] ones i'm not saying in relation to
[50:32] russia and ukraine there i don't know
[50:34] whose bed was good but the point is this
[50:36] our soldiers in the body protects the
[50:40] the government protect the kingdom that
[50:42] is why you get sick
[50:44] now what do you do when you get sick
[50:50] who can tell me what do you do when you
[50:51] get sick
[51:01] a man another one
[51:03] recover how do you recover
[51:06] what do you do to recover
[51:09] [Laughter]
[51:10] you eat build on somebody says something
[51:12] like medicine
[51:14] you take the medicine to recover right
[51:16] in other words you are trying to boost
[51:18] and support the soldiers of the body so
[51:20] that the kingdom can stand are we
[51:22] together so that's what you are trying
[51:24] to do otherwise the kingdom will fall
[51:28] we'll say oh he was he was a good man
[51:30] and we bury him because the kingdom has
[51:32] fallen right
[51:34] so that is what me and you do at channel
[51:37] level
[51:38] so there's a spiritual level there's a
[51:41] body spiritually if me and you go an
[51:44] extra mile and you their brothers and
[51:46] sisters on video
[51:49] if you
[51:50] go an extra mile to go to the doctor to
[51:53] recover
[51:55] for operation you drink medicine
[51:58] you sleep you eat biltong for you to
[52:01] recover
[52:02] you do all sorts of things for this body
[52:04] to to recover to boost the immune system
[52:07] which are the soldiers of the body what
[52:09] must happen to the spiritual body which
[52:11] is your spiritual government
[52:13] what happens
[52:14] what what do you do do you just leave it
[52:19] what happens when your spiritual body
[52:21] gets weakened gets attacked
[52:23] by some soldiers
[52:28] the problem is this
[52:30] we are very very good and i'm sorry let
[52:33] me be frank we are very good
[52:35] in acting to support the colonel
[52:38] soldiers we are very quick
[52:40] but when we come to the soldiers of our
[52:43] spirit our spirit our soul
[52:46] so that that kingdom can stand
[52:48] we go slow the ammunition comes slow
[52:54] why does the ammunition come slow david
[52:57] i don't understand
[52:58] why if if now i feel hungry that hey i'm
[53:02] weak man i must go and eat
[53:04] huh if i feel that hey my food is aching
[53:06] i must take ibuprofen you know i will
[53:08] prove him
[53:11] and then you find that
[53:13] before you know it it even knocks you
[53:15] down you sleep and then you wake up the
[53:17] pain is gone hey sister you wake up the
[53:19] pain is gone you you help the body to
[53:22] recover
[53:23] but now there you are
[53:25] one week
[53:27] you haven't spoken to your father
[53:30] one day you have not had one thought
[53:32] about your father huh
[53:34] remember there's one principle about war
[53:38] you're either for them
[53:39] or against them right there's no three
[53:41] ways about it there's no middle way
[53:44] where you say no i was just lazy i was
[53:48] just too tired i did not oh i didn't
[53:50] have a close-up with the lord there's no
[53:52] two ways about if you didn't do it that
[53:54] means you're supporting the other side
[53:56] that's a very hard one but is the truth
[54:00] you are either swim you either swim
[54:03] or use or you drown
[54:06] now if you find yourself that you are
[54:08] not swimming the way you are supposed to
[54:10] swim you must know that from that point
[54:12] you are drowning
[54:14] if you are not fighting or supplying the
[54:17] ammunition
[54:20] for the soldiers of my body
[54:23] for the kingdom to stand
[54:25] you must know that
[54:27] you are supporting
[54:29] like the other side
[54:31] that's an automatic
[54:33] rule of law
[54:36] you are not doing that but we need to be
[54:39] able to come to a point where we that we
[54:42] immunize
[54:43] you you you you put more ammunition in
[54:46] the body and not be in denial if i did
[54:49] not do what i'm supposed to do for my
[54:52] kingdom to stand for my spiritual body
[54:54] to be strengthened i must accept it
[54:57] you see the people who actually accept
[55:01] when they are wrong
[55:03] they are the ones who get help they are
[55:05] the ones who grow
[55:06] they are the ones who get empowered
[55:09] because they are not in denial they do a
[55:11] self-introspection but let's not go that
[55:14] route the point i wanted to bring to you
[55:16] was
[55:17] if a physical body we can make such an
[55:20] effort
[55:22] the same thing or two three four double
[55:25] quadruple must happen to our spiritual
[55:28] body
[55:30] it must get the same vitamins i must go
[55:34] on a spiritual cheeto
[55:37] thing and i feed it i must order that
[55:40] that shop what do you call it while they
[55:42] bring the green stuff
[55:45] you know that shop where they just order
[55:46] they brain
[55:48] hello fresh i must have my halo fresh
[55:52] every week
[55:53] i must have order it every day i must
[55:56] make sure the food that my body eats
[55:58] otherwise my soul the ammunition of my
[56:00] body will be weakened otherwise the
[56:02] soldiers of my body will otherwise my
[56:04] kingdom will
[56:05] be weakened
[56:07] that's the kingdom that i want us to
[56:08] focus on tonight you see now if we read
[56:11] in the book of luke 17 i'll read it for
[56:13] you
[56:15] that 17 verse 20 and when he was
[56:18] demanded of the pharisees when the
[56:20] kingdom of god should come he answered
[56:23] them and said the kingdom of god
[56:26] cometh not with observation
[56:31] now we're demanding him to know
[56:33] hey when is the kingdom of god coming
[56:36] and he said the kingdom of god does not
[56:38] come by your observation by you seeing
[56:40] it
[56:41] neither shall they say lord hear o lord
[56:44] there for behold the kingdom of god is
[56:46] within you
[56:48] let me tell you something we will get to
[56:50] it
[56:52] the kingdom of god is within you
[56:54] actually let me put it blunt
[56:56] you are the kingdom of god you are part
[56:59] of the kingdom of god you are the
[57:00] kingdom of god why am i saying that he
[57:03] said the bible says um we are
[57:06] in isaiah i think it's isaiah nine or
[57:07] six we'll come across it he says that
[57:10] we're going to have a son and that son
[57:12] is going to be prince cancella and the
[57:14] kingdom of the government will be upon
[57:16] his shoulders am i right his shoulders
[57:19] will be on his shoulders who are the
[57:21] shoulders
[57:23] isn't it that you are the body if you
[57:26] are the body that the bible says the
[57:28] kingdom of god is upon the shoulders of
[57:32] that son
[57:33] he is the head and you are the shoulders
[57:35] the body so the kingdom is upon you in
[57:37] other words we are here
[57:39] managed under other governments but
[57:41] actually we are managed by a different
[57:43] government we are of a different kingdom
[57:46] [Music]
[57:49] that's who we are
[57:50] right here on earth it is within
[57:52] you a body
[57:55] i'll take let me take you more deeper in
[57:57] the body
[57:58] a body
[57:59] is so fascinating that we only see the
[58:02] outside you know inside there's
[58:05] something that is called a cell
[58:07] you know a cell there's something called
[58:09] a cell a cell is is is a little little
[58:14] kingdom by itself
[58:15] a cell
[58:17] a cell in
[58:18] a human being starts from one cell right
[58:21] then they say it multiplies trillions
[58:23] and trillions of cells every day
[58:26] trillions and trillions of cells we are
[58:28] just we are just cells
[58:30] but cells make tissues tissues makes
[58:34] organs then organs may get bored
[58:37] that's the system that's the government
[58:38] of this one so that cell that cell in
[58:41] itself he's got his own life
[58:44] it's it it functions if you if they open
[58:46] yourself you're going to be amazed
[58:49] you must go on youtube and check you'll
[58:50] find that inside a cell it's like a
[58:53] whole fact
[58:54] there's manufacturing every day of new
[58:58] cells
[58:59] the people not the people
[59:02] but to me they were like people those
[59:05] those little animations they're working
[59:08] inside the cell
[59:09] but you know what we've got millions and
[59:11] millions and millions of cells in your
[59:13] body
[59:15] some die
[59:16] millions get created every day
[59:18] so inside the little cell imagine if a
[59:20] cell gets attacked by another wrong cell
[59:24] what will happen to the government of
[59:26] that little cell
[59:27] huh just imagine just imagine this whole
[59:31] big kingdom called the universe
[59:33] that god has set in place and works in
[59:36] harmony and works together where jupiter
[59:39] has got its own orbit where mars where
[59:42] satan where every other planet where all
[59:46] the galaxies are working in harmony just
[59:48] imagine if another one one day decides
[59:51] to go on the root of the other one what
[59:53] will happen to that government
[59:55] call it the universe what will happen to
[59:57] that kingdom
[59:59] chaos
[1:00:00] just imagine if the day what today a day
[1:00:03] just decide that today i'm not going to
[1:00:06] come from the east i'm going to come
[1:00:07] from west going that way
[1:00:09] just think about what will happen
[1:00:12] everything will shatter because we won't
[1:00:15] even know what is the time
[1:00:17] our systems in here our so-called
[1:00:19] government will fall
[1:00:22] the new zealand dollar will be minus one
[1:00:25] because the sun started from this side
[1:00:27] today the matter of everything will fall
[1:00:30] why because some of our greater
[1:00:32] governments and kingdoms
[1:00:34] are confused
[1:00:36] one thing keeps them on hold
[1:00:39] one thing and one thing alone and that's
[1:00:41] the love of god
[1:00:42] for god so loved the world remember
[1:00:45] after brother and the priest
[1:00:48] he like telling us about the ideal
[1:00:50] condition
[1:00:51] god created the earth in a certain
[1:00:53] condition and he set up the systems how
[1:00:56] everything must function
[1:00:58] and they are held by his love like this
[1:01:02] he spoke and then
[1:01:04] logos came out of his mouth
[1:01:06] at i don't know what speed
[1:01:10] and then he said stop
[1:01:12] and everything stopped
[1:01:14] and then everything started to blossom
[1:01:16] and every planet everything you know
[1:01:18] everything was just like brother branham
[1:01:20] if you listen to him correct him
[1:01:21] dramatizing it
[1:01:23] when the son of god created when god
[1:01:25] said let there be and everything came
[1:01:27] spew out of his mouth like that and
[1:01:29] create god created and everything was
[1:01:31] like beautiful
[1:01:33] and started to function like that
[1:01:35] right now that's the government that's a
[1:01:37] kingdom by itself it's a system that
[1:01:40] controls how the universe work
[1:01:43] and it works with each other in harmony
[1:01:45] same thing with the human body to the
[1:01:48] smallest smallest smallest part for the
[1:01:50] band called a cell
[1:01:53] everywhere we've got we are just a bunch
[1:01:55] of cells
[1:01:57] but what is wonderful about it and
[1:01:59] inside each and every cell
[1:02:01] there's a lot of work happening
[1:02:04] a lot of work and inside them those
[1:02:06] members they are busy working in harmony
[1:02:12] let's just let a cancer cell come in
[1:02:13] there you'll see
[1:02:15] now if the cancer cell comes in there
[1:02:17] and then
[1:02:18] the physical science medical science
[1:02:21] fails to remove it another force another
[1:02:24] power from somewhere from another
[1:02:26] kingdom comes and it crushes it
[1:02:30] what what what happened to the cancers
[1:02:32] that brother branham prayed and even
[1:02:35] among us today the word of god was
[1:02:36] broken and cancer disappeared what kind
[1:02:39] of of of of soldiers were brought there
[1:02:42] in the body if you think about it
[1:02:43] carnally
[1:02:45] you can't explain it but the soldiers
[1:02:47] came some soldiers from somewhere
[1:02:50] they may call them aliens i don't know
[1:02:53] but some some soldiers came and said hey
[1:02:55] you guys you
[1:02:57] medical science failed to remove you you
[1:02:59] can't
[1:03:00] now boom
[1:03:12] and then suddenly that cancer was gone
[1:03:15] what happened to it medically they can't
[1:03:17] explain it right but it's because a
[1:03:20] different different ammunition from
[1:03:23] somewhere came a different kingdom
[1:03:30] now
[1:03:31] uh
[1:03:33] i was at verse 22 of luke 17 and he said
[1:03:36] unto the disciples the days will come
[1:03:38] when ye shall desire to see one of these
[1:03:41] days of the son of man and you shall not
[1:03:43] see it
[1:03:44] and they shall say unto you see here
[1:03:47] or see there go not after them no follow
[1:03:50] them and this is the day
[1:03:54] we are living in that day when they are
[1:03:55] telling us hey there there
[1:03:59] he says don't go there
[1:04:01] for as a lightning that light lighted
[1:04:04] out of the one part of under heaven
[1:04:07] shine it unto the other part under
[1:04:09] heaven so shall the son of man be in
[1:04:12] this day
[1:04:13] it has already shined from the east to
[1:04:16] the west
[1:04:17] right it has already shined
[1:04:20] the word of god has already moved from
[1:04:21] the east to the west
[1:04:23] where the sun set
[1:04:25] this is the day we are living in this is
[1:04:27] the day where the military of our
[1:04:30] kingdom
[1:04:31] when it comes
[1:04:32] everything runs
[1:04:34] everything should run
[1:04:35] if it does not run
[1:04:37] there is a problem somewhere within the
[1:04:39] kingdom
[1:04:40] something must be done
[1:04:42] talk to the general
[1:04:44] talk to the captain because there's a
[1:04:46] hierarchy
[1:04:49] everything you see that the devil is
[1:04:50] trying to do he's actually trying to
[1:04:52] copy what god has already done
[1:04:55] hierarchy seniority you know he's the
[1:04:58] head the devil wants to be the head
[1:05:00] you see he's coping but because him he's
[1:05:03] satan he's a perverted guy
[1:05:06] he's doing it in a wrong way so there's
[1:05:08] hierarchy also
[1:05:10] in heaven
[1:05:12] god is the head
[1:05:13] there's angels there's shadow beams
[1:05:16] there's that there's even arch angels
[1:05:18] are we together so the devil tried to
[1:05:20] copy that now talk to the general
[1:05:23] excuse me talk to the general if there's
[1:05:25] a problem engage
[1:05:27] the members of the kingdom
[1:05:30] don't let your body go down and you come
[1:05:33] to a point of
[1:05:34] complacency where your eyes are like
[1:05:37] samsung's ones have been taken out
[1:05:41] where you accept the status call
[1:05:44] to a point where you accept abnormal as
[1:05:47] normal
[1:05:49] no
[1:05:50] it must not be that way
[1:05:53] let's read what the prophet says there
[1:05:55] oh yeah let me finish
[1:05:57] luke 17.
[1:05:58] but first must he suffer many things and
[1:06:01] be rejected for this generation and as
[1:06:04] it was in the days of noah
[1:06:06] so shall it be in the days
[1:06:09] here
[1:06:10] what happened in the days of noah
[1:06:12] i'll give it to you more spiritual the
[1:06:14] physical part you know it in the days of
[1:06:16] noah noah built the ark after building
[1:06:19] the ark he finished it and then he he
[1:06:22] put
[1:06:23] what's that the thing that he put on the
[1:06:25] ark
[1:06:26] to pitch it what did he use
[1:06:29] he used gopher wood and then he applied
[1:06:31] what
[1:06:33] ta he applied it applied it why to put
[1:06:36] the act together so that the ark when
[1:06:39] the water come it must not come through
[1:06:41] no enemy forces can come through
[1:06:44] right he sealed it hallelujah right and
[1:06:47] then he pissed it
[1:06:49] and then it was able to float
[1:06:52] by the so so what happened that time is
[1:06:55] happening today
[1:06:56] it will be like in the days of noah
[1:06:58] today god is busy pitching the ark
[1:07:01] he's pitching it pitching it so that
[1:07:04] this kingdom no enemy can be able no
[1:07:06] flat
[1:07:09] when the time for flood come
[1:07:11] you cannot sink
[1:07:13] we have been peace today my sister we
[1:07:15] have been pissed
[1:07:16] the ark is being pitched is closed the
[1:07:19] lord is about to close the door
[1:07:22] it's like i can see him he's almost
[1:07:24] going to close the door
[1:07:26] so let's make sure that ah we are being
[1:07:29] pitched
[1:07:31] because that part that cannot be peace
[1:07:33] is going to disadvantage the kingdom
[1:07:36] every one of us has got an important
[1:07:39] role to play remember at the beginning i
[1:07:41] told you that we are a mystic body
[1:07:43] there is this kind of people
[1:07:46] i'm sorry brother let me just pass that
[1:07:48] one
[1:07:49] there is this kind of believers when the
[1:07:51] word is being preached
[1:07:53] them they are thinking of the person
[1:07:55] next to them
[1:07:58] huh
[1:07:59] and sister venus
[1:08:01] that the word is being principled or not
[1:08:02] but i'm busy thinking arnold really must
[1:08:04] look into this huh
[1:08:08] but the word is talking to me
[1:08:10] i i i i i'm lacking the revelation
[1:08:14] of actually what the body is all about
[1:08:17] because i am being pissed
[1:08:19] i am being strengthened i am being
[1:08:21] solidified i am being given the
[1:08:23] ammunition but i'm passing it to my
[1:08:25] friend who does not need what i'm being
[1:08:27] given he needs that the lord is busy
[1:08:29] dealing with him in a different
[1:08:31] ammunition ammunition but i'm passing it
[1:08:33] to system i guess you know stomach you
[1:08:35] really must look into this but the way
[1:08:38] it is talking to me
[1:08:40] let us not be those kind of believers
[1:08:42] when the word talks
[1:08:44] don't even think of them of the minister
[1:08:46] don't even think of the one next to you
[1:08:48] think about yourself
[1:08:50] because it is addressing you
[1:08:53] the word is addressing you to to you are
[1:08:55] being pieced
[1:08:57] yeah you are you are the the flood is
[1:08:59] about to come
[1:09:01] the prophet has spoken because that is
[1:09:04] now he said here it will be like in the
[1:09:06] days of noah
[1:09:09] it's exactly going to be there's many
[1:09:10] things that i can tell you that are like
[1:09:13] in the days of noah but i'm just wanting
[1:09:14] to focus on what happened to the ark
[1:09:18] they pitched it pissed it pissed it past
[1:09:21] it and it does not destroy it without
[1:09:23] with the flat
[1:09:25] right
[1:09:26] but the problem in the message uh checks
[1:09:28] each book
[1:09:29] uh he says here that means the mystery
[1:09:32] of the test and the wheat
[1:09:35] of matthew 13 24 30 is now also
[1:09:38] fulfilled
[1:09:39] another parable put forth
[1:09:43] put he fought unto them saying the
[1:09:45] kingdom of heaven is like an unto a man
[1:09:48] which saw with good seed and he's filled
[1:09:51] but while man sleep
[1:09:53] slept his enemy came and sold tests
[1:09:57] among the wheat and went his way but
[1:10:00] when the blade was sprung up and abroad
[1:10:04] fought fruit
[1:10:06] then
[1:10:08] appeared the test also
[1:10:10] you see what happens is this
[1:10:13] and there comes a time in the life of a
[1:10:15] believer or a person where you you you
[1:10:19] you sleep
[1:10:20] i'm not talking about physical sleeping
[1:10:24] there comes a time when you you snooze
[1:10:27] the bible says we must not be and
[1:10:30] what's the weight
[1:10:32] slothful thank you that's not the
[1:10:34] worst one who was that thank you brother
[1:10:36] well the bible says you must not be
[1:10:38] slothful spiritually we must be alert we
[1:10:41] must not sleep because when we sleep
[1:10:44] because god has planted the seeds in our
[1:10:47] lives when we sleep
[1:10:50] the enemy comes
[1:10:52] and he plants the seeds
[1:10:53] that's when we sleep spiritually
[1:10:56] you cannot sleep while you are in the
[1:10:58] kingdom
[1:11:00] you can't sleep while you are at war
[1:11:03] imagine i saw the pres the prime
[1:11:05] minister of ukraine walking on the
[1:11:07] street with soldiers
[1:11:08] i mean is the prison or maybe you expect
[1:11:10] him to be in comfort hiding in the
[1:11:11] bunker
[1:11:12] no no he's busy how can he sleep
[1:11:15] there is war
[1:11:17] putin is busy
[1:11:19] because we are in a state of war
[1:11:22] we cannot afford to sleep
[1:11:24] spiritually
[1:11:27] because you can just be a little point
[1:11:29] of weakness for us to lose the war
[1:11:32] but because god cannot lose no no
[1:11:35] when we sleep the enemy comes
[1:11:38] and he plants the seeds and you know
[1:11:40] what's the danger my brother my sister
[1:11:41] do you know what the danger those sins
[1:11:43] of the enemy because the enemy comes
[1:11:45] like
[1:11:46] at night
[1:11:49] and he plants the seeds
[1:11:52] and then we wake up in the morning we
[1:11:54] don't know anything
[1:11:56] we don't know
[1:11:57] that the seeds have been planted in our
[1:12:01] kingdom
[1:12:02] we don't know
[1:12:03] and then we wake up we continue with
[1:12:05] life
[1:12:06] the problem is going to come when the
[1:12:08] blade of grass or that that they
[1:12:11] geminate the bible says
[1:12:15] uh
[1:12:17] but when the blade was sprung up when
[1:12:19] they they started to grow and the bible
[1:12:22] even says
[1:12:23] up and brought fruit you see you're
[1:12:25] stuck there it is on the board thank you
[1:12:28] you start to see them when the fruit
[1:12:30] come
[1:12:31] just tell me how long does it take for
[1:12:33] the fruits to come
[1:12:35] imagine from the time of planting until
[1:12:38] the time of the fruits the enemy planted
[1:12:40] wrong seeds but you are only going to
[1:12:42] see them when the fruit come that's a
[1:12:45] long time
[1:12:48] why simply because you and me we slept
[1:12:55] wake up one morning there's a wrong
[1:12:57] fruit here
[1:12:59] what is happening
[1:13:03] because i slept
[1:13:05] at war
[1:13:07] you know if you sleep on duty
[1:13:09] we don't even take you for a hearing
[1:13:12] we fire you
[1:13:14] if you sleep on
[1:13:16] duty fired
[1:13:20] and now that's the kingdom of the devil
[1:13:21] they fire you
[1:13:23] ask
[1:13:24] we wake you up
[1:13:25] you say hey my friend
[1:13:27] wake up my brother with love because our
[1:13:29] kingdom remember what is the lord
[1:13:31] pitching it up with
[1:13:32] you know
[1:13:33] that that combination of love the holy
[1:13:36] spirit himself he's pitching it
[1:13:38] so you don't wake up your brother
[1:13:40] and say hey brother you'll go to hell no
[1:13:43] no no that's not love
[1:13:45] of course love is corrective
[1:13:47] you come first of all with the right
[1:13:50] attitude
[1:13:53] your inside of the inside
[1:13:55] must love bad brother and bad sister
[1:13:58] love first why because the first thing
[1:14:00] that god did
[1:14:02] the first thing
[1:14:04] he loved us
[1:14:06] and then he came after loving us he was
[1:14:08] able to overlook to see beyond our sins
[1:14:12] to see beyond our fall when you love
[1:14:15] your brother you are able to see beyond
[1:14:19] what he's doing even if what he's doing
[1:14:21] has hurt you you've got a wound
[1:14:23] he exposed you and you were short you
[1:14:26] said my friend i'm short
[1:14:28] here's the wound you know you know i was
[1:14:30] short because of i think you there you
[1:14:32] you slept a bit
[1:14:34] so next time when you go there and then
[1:14:36] you know you come with a right attitude
[1:14:38] with the right spirit and then you are
[1:14:40] able to win your brother or your sister
[1:14:42] beg
[1:14:43] you you me and you must see beyond
[1:14:46] so that i like to stand closer to the
[1:14:48] people
[1:14:49] right
[1:14:51] the fruits come and then we are amazed
[1:14:55] why
[1:14:56] because when we were sleeping which is
[1:14:58] something we were not supposed to do
[1:15:01] the devil came and put the seats
[1:15:04] after that
[1:15:05] the time goes time goes time goes time
[1:15:07] goes and then we start to ah yeah what's
[1:15:09] happening why are the seeds no no no no
[1:15:12] seeds were planted
[1:15:14] long beach
[1:15:16] all this time you are praying you are
[1:15:18] doing things you think you are watering
[1:15:20] the right thing no no there are seeds
[1:15:22] there
[1:15:24] that is what the bible says
[1:15:27] check up
[1:15:28] let's check up ourselves
[1:15:30] let's go to the doctor and check up
[1:15:32] ourselves isn't it we take these bodies
[1:15:34] to their doctor we just wake up one day
[1:15:37] plus yeah new zealand is cheaper i just
[1:15:39] wake up i want to go to check up
[1:15:42] i must go for checkup
[1:15:44] let's go to the spiritual checkup
[1:15:47] yes sir and i check ourselves so that
[1:15:48] the doctor can say hey my brother you
[1:15:50] did well by coming did you know one of
[1:15:52] your teeth is shaking it did you did you
[1:15:54] know you say no i'll take it out for you
[1:15:56] there's an infection here did you know
[1:15:58] that no doctor i never know nothing then
[1:16:00] sistana takes it out for you
[1:16:03] huh or she just give you the injection
[1:16:05] then you are good because you go for a
[1:16:07] checkup let's go for to checkup
[1:16:10] and when you vote for checkup
[1:16:14] has anybody ever argued with the doctor
[1:16:17] when the doctor you know stephen says
[1:16:20] that
[1:16:21] we've got a lot of nurses here
[1:16:22] stabilizers for my sister and it's the
[1:16:24] opponent you know in their days when
[1:16:26] they're there when when they tell you
[1:16:29] you agree with them even if
[1:16:33] even if you are the brother in church
[1:16:34] and you go there they must give
[1:16:36] injection you allow them
[1:16:38] to give you injection because they are
[1:16:40] doing their duty
[1:16:42] isn't it you don't argue
[1:16:44] they are telling you that if we put this
[1:16:46] injection here rather than poor it is
[1:16:49] going to be effective you don't say no
[1:16:51] sister vanessa i put it here no no you
[1:16:53] don't like she puts it there
[1:16:55] then it works and you say then tomorrow
[1:16:57] you can come to church and say god bless
[1:16:59] you right
[1:17:00] but the point i'm trying to say is that
[1:17:03] when you go for a spiritual checkup
[1:17:06] and then the lord brings things to your
[1:17:08] remembrance
[1:17:09] don't argue with them
[1:17:12] until you even come here for communion
[1:17:14] and you eat communion with the wrong
[1:17:17] seeds in life
[1:17:20] it's simply to go to your sister and say
[1:17:22] system like you forgive me my sister
[1:17:24] you know when i was thinking last night
[1:17:26] i didn't have a good thought about you
[1:17:28] can you forgive me that's all he does
[1:17:31] that the moment you expose him he runs
[1:17:33] like he he just goes into mist
[1:17:36] the moment you go to the lord and say
[1:17:38] lord lord forgive me let's say lord
[1:17:40] thank you for reminding me that that
[1:17:42] thought in my mind was not a good one
[1:17:44] about my brother or my sister that i
[1:17:47] exposed the body
[1:17:48] my body
[1:17:50] first of all
[1:17:52] forgive me my father and you go with all
[1:17:54] your heart
[1:17:55] you know what the devil is dead that and
[1:17:57] that even before you go to your sister
[1:18:00] there and there the devil is dead
[1:18:03] because you confessed your sin before
[1:18:05] the lord
[1:18:06] and blessings are upon you
[1:18:08] they are coming your way fruits they
[1:18:11] come the wonderful thing is this then
[1:18:13] appeared the test also so the servants
[1:18:16] of the householder came and said unto
[1:18:19] his unto him say didn't you did you know
[1:18:22] that was so good cease in the field and
[1:18:25] we know the story
[1:18:26] he said oh no no it's fun because they
[1:18:28] are there already those leave them
[1:18:30] there's coming time
[1:18:32] for reaping
[1:18:35] when we get to that time we are going to
[1:18:37] start with them
[1:18:39] and we bind them we bind them we back
[1:18:41] this is the time for binding
[1:18:43] find them bind them and they go to the
[1:18:45] fire so we don't even have to come to a
[1:18:47] point where the fruits come let's always
[1:18:50] be in a mode of war in a mode of fight
[1:18:54] all the time with the devil amen
[1:18:58] now
[1:19:01] the divisions
[1:19:02] in any kingdom causes it to follow
[1:19:06] right
[1:19:07] and then it's but it you you will find
[1:19:10] out that
[1:19:12] every fall or every destruction or every
[1:19:16] coup
[1:19:17] huh
[1:19:18] everything in think about all the types
[1:19:20] of governments with including a body
[1:19:22] that i've mentioned everything
[1:19:25] starts in from inside
[1:19:27] it starts from inside
[1:19:30] a coup when they they topple the
[1:19:32] government where does it start
[1:19:35] from inside
[1:19:36] if you see something happens and the
[1:19:38] government falls
[1:19:40] inside
[1:19:41] when my body gets sick and i die
[1:19:45] the soldiers of the devil came attacked
[1:19:47] the body from
[1:19:49] inside
[1:19:50] everything so we must always check
[1:19:53] ourselves from
[1:19:56] are we together believers
[1:19:59] before i say brother armand
[1:20:02] remove this little tick from your eye
[1:20:05] no no i must first check from my inside
[1:20:11] and remove my beam
[1:20:14] so that i can see that oh i'm sorry
[1:20:16] brother i did not see you don't even
[1:20:18] have a stick
[1:20:21] i was not seen properly because i didn't
[1:20:23] remove my beam first you don't even have
[1:20:26] that so we always need for the things to
[1:20:29] get work better imagine imagine if
[1:20:32] everyone checked from the inside first
[1:20:35] no one will have to correct another one
[1:20:38] the pastor will just be coming here in
[1:20:40] every every day and say
[1:20:42] i greet you all of you today and we pray
[1:20:44] and he says can i tell you something
[1:20:45] right you're going home
[1:20:48] and then we go home
[1:20:52] the pastor won't have a tough job
[1:20:54] that imagine the holy spirit come here
[1:20:56] and preach and tells us to stop lying
[1:21:06] and then we go home
[1:21:08] and we are in denial
[1:21:10] we don't want to accept it
[1:21:12] are we fighting for the body
[1:21:14] or against the body
[1:21:18] may god help us eh
[1:21:22] the moment one part starts to work
[1:21:24] against the other part
[1:21:25] we are going down just like how a human
[1:21:27] body worker spoke about diseases i won't
[1:21:29] repeat that
[1:21:31] but the point i want to bring to you is
[1:21:33] that
[1:21:34] i want to emphasize on this point
[1:21:36] if it is so easy for us to look after
[1:21:39] this physical body
[1:21:40] let us then do our due diligence
[1:21:44] for a spiritual body
[1:21:46] every day my sister my brother let's do
[1:21:48] it every day then you'll receive the
[1:21:50] results then you're not gonna be amazed
[1:21:53] when the time for fruits come
[1:21:56] i'm almost closing it remember i
[1:21:58] promised you
[1:21:59] that i will be short
[1:22:03] right i want to read for you here
[1:22:05] from
[1:22:06] the spoken word is the original
[1:22:08] seat the spoken weight is the original
[1:22:14] the bible said it would is that right
[1:22:17] i have 9 6 okay it's coming to that
[1:22:19] point that i raised earlier
[1:22:21] and to us a child is born so is given
[1:22:25] the name shall be called counselor
[1:22:27] prince of peace mighty god everlasting
[1:22:29] father and his kingdom shall be
[1:22:35] and his kingdom shall be no shall have
[1:22:37] no end
[1:22:39] and the government shall be upon us
[1:22:42] and the shoulders are on there
[1:22:45] on the body
[1:22:46] and you are part of them
[1:22:49] imagine if you are on the shoulders
[1:22:51] you're on the top man
[1:22:54] but i'm so happy even if i'm at all a
[1:22:56] small one
[1:22:58] i'm very happy because i know that i'm
[1:23:00] part of the body
[1:23:01] and the shoulder is going nowhere
[1:23:03] without me
[1:23:06] you see that is very exciting
[1:23:08] it doesn't matter whether you are at all
[1:23:12] yeah that's right oh hey what do you
[1:23:14] call this one
[1:23:18] it doesn't matter
[1:23:20] it does not matter but you are part of
[1:23:22] the body a shoulder or an egg is going
[1:23:25] nowhere
[1:23:26] i told you
[1:23:27] so that's a very important part
[1:23:30] if you want to see that a small toe is
[1:23:32] important
[1:23:33] cut it yeah oh boy and run
[1:23:36] try to run
[1:23:39] yeah have you ever seen someone who when
[1:23:41] we were boys we used to play mario on
[1:23:43] barefoot winter summer
[1:23:45] we go to school you know and then
[1:23:47] sometimes we didn't like but regularly
[1:23:50] that's how we grew up you know that's
[1:23:52] the life we grew up and i'm very proud
[1:23:53] of that kind of a life
[1:23:55] now sometimes
[1:23:57] in the midst of winter it will be so
[1:23:59] cold
[1:24:00] that hey your feet will crack
[1:24:03] not enough shoes eh you'll see shoes
[1:24:05] christmas time
[1:24:07] huh now
[1:24:09] and then
[1:24:10] if we are playing soccer playing soccer
[1:24:11] playing soccer and then another one
[1:24:13] blocks me and then your toe cuts from
[1:24:15] the bottom
[1:24:17] you know just have a little crack a
[1:24:18] small small little crack
[1:24:21] oh you must see that boy going to school
[1:24:24] why
[1:24:26] i mean the whole body why can't he just
[1:24:27] walk that's a small wound
[1:24:30] no no that is very important
[1:24:33] because it's part of the
[1:24:35] body
[1:24:37] has any of you ever had a small little
[1:24:39] pimple
[1:24:40] a small small small one on the tongue on
[1:24:42] the side
[1:24:45] you even have a headache
[1:24:47] you even develop a headache
[1:24:50] and bra marion
[1:24:52] i can't come today to work my brother
[1:24:55] why marion
[1:24:56] i've got such a terrible headache
[1:24:59] from last night
[1:25:01] what's the cause of that i think i have
[1:25:02] to be pimple
[1:25:05] people
[1:25:07] yes
[1:25:08] a good employee will understand that a
[1:25:09] pimple affects the whole body
[1:25:13] so
[1:25:14] the point i'm trying to say here is the
[1:25:16] importance
[1:25:18] of every part of the
[1:25:21] body
[1:25:22] wait until you have that little pimple
[1:25:24] inside the nose
[1:25:26] no one will touch you
[1:25:30] no you cannot touch me on the pimple on
[1:25:32] the nose my wife knows
[1:25:39] so it is very slow and it can cause a
[1:25:41] headache
[1:25:42] it can cause problems for the body
[1:25:45] what i need to do is to have medication
[1:25:48] if we can do all those things
[1:25:50] but yet when we approach some parts of
[1:25:52] the body we deal with them like them
[1:25:54] they are not important
[1:26:02] why is it like that
[1:26:08] help us lord
[1:26:09] so
[1:26:11] the government will be on his shoulders
[1:26:13] right
[1:26:14] which is us
[1:26:16] remember we said the kingdom of god is
[1:26:17] within
[1:26:18] you
[1:26:19] so if the government here
[1:26:22] in new zealand
[1:26:24] every department is important
[1:26:26] that means this government called
[1:26:28] shakkaina tabernacle must always
[1:26:32] be under the sunlight
[1:26:34] beam must always be under the shekinah
[1:26:38] glory
[1:26:40] for one another
[1:26:42] alone
[1:26:43] with you i must be the same
[1:26:47] i must love you the same not only when i
[1:26:49] see you i i i smile with you why not
[1:26:51] when i'm alone as a ha that one
[1:26:54] i'll just pray no
[1:26:56] i'm a slav
[1:26:59] unconditional
[1:27:00] i don't know why i'm going that route
[1:27:02] but the point is this the shoulders will
[1:27:04] be upon his government
[1:27:06] and i mean the girl
[1:27:11] i'm sorry the government will be upon
[1:27:13] his shoulders
[1:27:14] and
[1:27:15] he says brother branham in that spoken
[1:27:17] word and the government shall be upon
[1:27:19] his what
[1:27:21] that's what they wrote the congregation
[1:27:22] said shoulder
[1:27:24] that's part of his body my that is his
[1:27:28] body
[1:27:30] it
[1:27:30] is it is it
[1:27:33] sorry brother is asking is it
[1:27:35] his shoulders
[1:27:37] is his body where is the government on
[1:27:39] the earth at
[1:27:42] in other words you and me are part of
[1:27:45] god's government on earth
[1:27:47] we are the authority of god's government
[1:27:49] on earth
[1:27:52] in his body
[1:27:54] saying shall judge the earth remember
[1:27:55] that's right
[1:27:56] paul said i dare you to go to court with
[1:27:59] one another and not take it before the
[1:28:02] church right see saints shall judge the
[1:28:05] earth
[1:28:07] where is the government going to be upon
[1:28:09] upon his shoulders his body the
[1:28:11] government
[1:28:12] upon his shoulders that's the part of
[1:28:14] his body what is it his earthly strength
[1:28:17] god's earthly strength is his weight
[1:28:20] made flesh in his body
[1:28:23] you
[1:28:24] your god sweat made flesh
[1:28:26] you you've got the government you've got
[1:28:29] the authority you've got the kingdom you
[1:28:32] are part of the kingdom
[1:28:33] the only thing is that you are working
[1:28:35] in harmony with another part of
[1:28:37] government
[1:28:38] you know to achieve every
[1:28:40] kingdom is within you
[1:28:43] but every part works with another one in
[1:28:46] collusion
[1:28:47] to achieve the goals of government in
[1:28:49] conclusion i want to read for you a
[1:28:52] little piece

[1:30:50] witnesses in acts 1 8 he said you shall
[1:30:52] be my witnesses after the holy ghost has
[1:30:55] come on you
[1:30:57] it is the holy spirit it is the presence
[1:31:00] of the lord in our life that pitches
[1:31:02] this building that pitches us
[1:31:05] and it makes us one kingdom one unit
[1:31:08] irrespective of what we see here or or
[1:31:11] experience
[1:31:12] but the love for my brother my sister
[1:31:15] must be unconditional
[1:31:17] the way i approach him amen now
[1:31:20] what is the church the mystic body of
[1:31:22] christ who set it up okay i've already
[1:31:24] read that one he is the king he wants to
[1:31:27] be king he wants to rule us he wants to
[1:31:30] be lord
[1:31:32] people let him in say people let him in
[1:31:36] say i let him let be myself let him be
[1:31:39] my savior but
[1:31:41] they won't let him be the lord lord
[1:31:44] means ownership
[1:31:46] it means rulership
[1:31:48] how can you say is your lord
[1:31:51] but you don't want him to rule or own
[1:31:53] over you
[1:31:56] i'm here to see a woman who's married
[1:31:58] who does not want to be to change her
[1:32:00] surname
[1:32:03] i'm sorry if there's those ones like
[1:32:04] that but ordinarily
[1:32:06] typically or let's say ideally
[1:32:08] she's supposed to change his neighbor or
[1:32:10] not
[1:32:11] because she's becoming she's becoming
[1:32:14] a milan
[1:32:18] so
[1:32:19] ownership rulership come into my heart
[1:32:22] lord save me from hell but don't tell me
[1:32:25] what to do
[1:32:29] take everything you want
[1:32:31] but don't tell me what to do
[1:32:34] is that how we want it
[1:32:36] help us my father my god
[1:32:39] he must
[1:32:40] he must tell us what to do
[1:32:44] because he's a prince of peace he's the
[1:32:46] prince of love he knows exactly how to
[1:32:49] say it to you how to tell it to you how
[1:32:52] to pitch it to you he knows what you can
[1:32:54] take what you can take because he's the
[1:32:56] prince of peace
[1:32:57] he's the prince of love
[1:33:00] some of us ask brothers we will overuse
[1:33:02] that authority we say hey sister
[1:33:05] i'm the head remember you must take
[1:33:07] everything no no the kingdom of peace
[1:33:09] don't approach things like that
[1:33:13] that's right
[1:33:15] so let's be careful dear brothers
[1:33:19] that's the attitude of the people
[1:33:22] take everything but don't tell me what
[1:33:24] to do
[1:33:26] that's the reason no wonder the bible
[1:33:28] says all the tables have become full of
[1:33:30] vomit you know what vomit is
[1:33:36] as a dog tends to eat vomit to his vomit
[1:33:38] if these organizations didn't work in
[1:33:40] the first place time in the first time
[1:33:43] and a god had to vomit them out you will
[1:33:46] go back to them they will make you vomit
[1:33:49] again
[1:33:51] so we cannot afford to associate
[1:33:53] ourselves with the things of the world
[1:33:56] we take our body for the checkup
[1:33:58] regularly we make sure that everything
[1:34:00] is above board
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:03] i'm reading now for you here from the
[1:34:05] spoken word five definitive
[1:34:06] identifications of the true church of
[1:34:08] the living god
[1:34:09] 1960
[1:34:12] and
[1:34:13] you know what vomit is as a dog turns
[1:34:15] into his vomit and these organizations
[1:34:17] didn't work in the first place in the
[1:34:19] first time and you go back to them
[1:34:22] they'll make you vomit again
[1:34:24] he said i will i will that you were hot
[1:34:27] or cold because you are because you are
[1:34:29] lukewarm i spew you out of my mouth you
[1:34:32] make god sick at his stomach
[1:34:35] he vomits out
[1:34:37] not you shakkaina
[1:34:39] this is just a warning
[1:34:41] that as we are targeting on this road
[1:34:45] along the way
[1:34:46] we are going to come across a detour
[1:34:50] which wants to take us into a wrong way
[1:34:52] watch out shakkaina
[1:34:55] there's coming a time
[1:34:56] we were told even on wednesday last week
[1:35:00] that
[1:35:01] there's no two ways about it it's coming
[1:35:04] the persecutions are coming but as we
[1:35:07] walk along the journey let us be ready
[1:35:10] let us be fully fully immune
[1:35:14] let us be fully armed
[1:35:17] fully armed
[1:35:18] with enough ammunition and have you know
[1:35:21] that missile where if you shoot the
[1:35:24] enemy you take his position and that
[1:35:26] bullet will not stop until it knocks the
[1:35:28] enemy
[1:35:29] left such have such kind of bullies amen
[1:35:32] brother branham prays here and in the in
[1:35:35] this book and he says dear god i will
[1:35:37] ask thy divine mercy upon these waiting
[1:35:39] per penny and soul souls penny penitent
[1:35:43] souls who believe that you are and a
[1:35:45] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:35:47] after him and i will ask you to be
[1:35:50] merciful unto them lord and whatever
[1:35:52] there is the cancer of doubt the cancer
[1:35:55] of temper
[1:35:56] the mclean
[1:35:58] malignancy of unbelief
[1:36:00] just just listen how the prophet
[1:36:02] explains these problems
[1:36:05] the cancer of unbelief
[1:36:07] the mclean
[1:36:09] malignancy of unbelief
[1:36:12] the cancer of temper
[1:36:14] you can name them
[1:36:16] the the cancer of of slaughterfulness
[1:36:20] the temper the cancer of just being
[1:36:23] lukewarm
[1:36:24] that's been without purpose
[1:36:27] that cancer has been unprayerful lack of
[1:36:30] prayer
[1:36:31] it's a cancer
[1:36:34] me if i can accept it that hey brother
[1:36:37] there's a cancer here you need to shoot
[1:36:39] it out
[1:36:40] when is it going to go out
[1:36:43] along the road as we walk as we head
[1:36:45] that along
[1:36:47] around the corner when jesus is coming
[1:36:49] before we reach him there's going to be
[1:36:52] quite a steep drive
[1:36:54] there's even a 4x4 can drive there
[1:36:58] there's going to be a some some part of
[1:37:00] the road as we just before we meet him
[1:37:03] that is going to be tough
[1:37:05] that needs us to be fully armed
[1:37:09] and this is the time for us to make sure
[1:37:12] that every aspect of the kingdom
[1:37:15] is
[1:37:16] strengthened
[1:37:18] he prays here the prophet he says
[1:37:20] lord and i give them the holy ghost
[1:37:23] i give you the holy ghost fill their
[1:37:26] souls with your goodness baptize them
[1:37:28] into thy kingdom just now as they have
[1:37:31] raised their hands in the confession of
[1:37:33] their faith
[1:37:35] and asking thee o merciful god to do
[1:37:38] this for them
[1:37:41] he's praying for you
[1:37:42] and for me
[1:37:44] the prophet
[1:37:47] so i cannot overemphasize the importance
[1:37:50] of you as an individual in this kingdom
[1:37:54] when we understand how a kingdom
[1:37:56] functions we understand the importance
[1:37:58] of each one of us
[1:38:00] we understand our contribution we
[1:38:02] understand that a little weakness on the
[1:38:06] chain
[1:38:09] can cause a big problem
[1:38:11] so let us hold fast
[1:38:13] this is just to encourage you to say hey
[1:38:17] i might be at all
[1:38:19] hey
[1:38:20] i might be a little pinky
[1:38:22] hey i might be
[1:38:24] an insignificant or so-called small part
[1:38:28] ah you might be a domain it's a kind of
[1:38:30] tabernacle
[1:38:32] you might be a little break here on the
[1:38:35] corner
[1:38:36] we we don't even touch or see it
[1:38:40] and another one think that he's a handle
[1:38:42] by the door of this building then he's
[1:38:44] more important no
[1:38:45] every part is important
[1:38:48] without that part on that corner of that
[1:38:50] roof
[1:38:51] there's no handle
[1:38:53] the house is not complete
[1:38:56] so shakina i want to encourage you
[1:38:59] over there in video land i want to
[1:39:01] encourage you and say
[1:39:03] let us not our eyes
