[15:45] just ever draw close to our lord jesus
[15:47] christ we know it's prophecy being
[15:49] fulfilled
[15:50] but you know as the bible says you know
[15:52] we're all one body around the earth so
[15:54] when one part suffers we all suffer when
[15:56] one part rejoices we all rejoice so we
[15:59] want to remember them in prayer but
[16:01] let's just i just want to read psalm 63
[16:03] oh god thou art my god early will i seek
[16:07] thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[16:10] longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty
[16:12] land where no water is to see thy power
[16:15] and thy glory so as i have seen thee in
[16:18] the sanctuary because thy loving
[16:20] kindness is better than life my lip
[16:22] shall praise thee thus will i bless thee
[16:25] while i live i will lift up my
[16:28] hands in thy name my soul shall be
[16:31] satisfied as with marrow and fatness
[16:33] with my mouth shall praise thee with
[16:36] joyful lips
[16:37] when i remember thee upon my beard and
[16:39] meditate on thee in the night watches
[16:42] because thou has been my help therefore
[16:44] in the shadow of thy wings will i
[16:46] rejoice
[16:47] my soul followeth heart after thee thy
[16:50] right hand upholdeth me but those that
[16:52] seek my soul to destroy it shall go into
[16:54] the lower parts of the earth they shall
[16:56] fall by the sword they shall be a
[16:58] portion for foxes but the king shall
[17:00] rejoice in god everyone that sweareth by
[17:03] him shall glory
[17:04] but the mouth of them that speak lies
[17:07] shall be stopped

[32:57] may stand here till
[32:59] probably tomorrow
[33:00] keep on talking and yeah
[33:03] i don't know i just know that the lord
[33:05] loves me so much
[33:07] he really
[33:08] loves me sometimes i don't know why
[33:10] because i'm not even wealthy office
[33:13] worthy of his love and care and
[33:15] he just loves me so much and yeah
[33:19] yeah so
[33:22] yeah i was heading if i can just start
[33:25] from there i was heading on because it's
[33:28] really rare for us to
[33:29] to attend the service because we live
[33:31] four hours away from christchurch and
[33:34] three hours from uh from nelson
[33:38] and the south island roads are really
[33:40] windy that's one of the things that sets
[33:43] me off when i think of driving
[33:45] and the other thing is i work at school
[33:48] and
[33:48] if i have to attend the service i'll
[33:50] have to spend the night in
[33:53] in christchurch or either nelson and
[33:54] attend the service and drive the next
[33:56] day back home
[33:58] so i don't often go to church i
[34:01] have a very busy
[34:02] sunday i start by zooming uh pastor
[34:06] greg's church and then i zoom wellington
[34:09] church and sometimes i zoom auckland
[34:10] church last night today
[34:12] like yeah so i just
[34:14] that's how we occupy ourselves and keep
[34:17] ourselves in the way then
[34:19] so yeah on the 26th of
[34:22] december
[34:23] i said to my kids oh yeah we have to go
[34:25] to church because tomorrow there's no
[34:27] there's no school there's no work
[34:29] and i was i had a lot of planning for
[34:31] that week like we had turn this will
[34:33] attend the service on the 26th and we
[34:35] will
[34:36] attend the the wash the watch night
[34:39] service on the same week and
[34:41] we will attend that so i was i thought
[34:44] of spending the whole week in
[34:45] christchurch just being
[34:46] attending the service and fellowshipping
[34:48] with the brothers and sisters
[34:50] and i didn't want to drive on the 25th
[34:52] because it was saturday i said to my
[34:54] kids you know let's just enjoy our
[34:56] christmas and we'll drive early in the
[34:58] morning and
[35:01] early morning the 26th i pick up my
[35:03] stuff and my kid and
[35:05] yeah there's some sometime when the lord
[35:07] speaks to you you don't know that it's
[35:09] the lord just do things and later only
[35:11] realize it was the lord that
[35:13] taught you
[35:14] put that thought in your mind to do that
[35:17] uh on the 25th at night i went out i
[35:19] filled my car with petrol but when
[35:21] coming back i stepped out of the van and
[35:23] something just told me go back to the
[35:24] van and fasten your kids car seats
[35:28] and that's what i did i've my my last
[35:30] bone is about three and parents who have
[35:33] kids you know that you don't have to
[35:35] fasten your two years old sit the way
[35:37] you fast and your three-month-old baby
[35:39] the secret set
[35:41] but that day i fasted my two years old
[35:43] sit and my almost five years old car
[35:46] seat like you do for the babies like i
[35:49] double fastened them i don't know what i
[35:51] was doing that i just double fastened
[35:52] them and you know it was really awkward
[35:54] but something just taught me to do that
[35:56] i don't even know why and
[35:59] that's what what i did and i wanted to
[36:01] go in the house again and something just
[36:02] told me take the prime you know your
[36:03] baby is so clingy and you like you to be
[36:05] carrying him so you can have your pram
[36:07] to push him in so i put the pram in the
[36:09] back of the car and those two things
[36:12] really saved our lives i cannot say
[36:14] really but it helped us and through that
[36:17] crash so i took off to christchurch and
[36:20] we prayed as normal before leaving
[36:22] starting the car we prayed and
[36:24] we left so on our way to christchurch
[36:27] and
[36:29] uh i think i'm still thinking as a south
[36:31] africa
[36:32] driving in south africa i saw that they
[36:34] say that lowest pass road was blocked
[36:37] but for me i thought okay if it's
[36:38] blocked somewhere maybe there's a road
[36:40] somewhere that you can take that away
[36:42] and then carry on to crash it but
[36:44] actually i had to stop there and
[36:46] take another route
[36:48] pass by another town and get to crash it
[36:50] so i kept on going thinking there's
[36:51] another way ahead there so on somewhere
[36:54] there along the road and i saw the the
[36:57] road was blocked and there was an office
[36:58] i would say lady you can't carry on you
[37:00] have to go back where you came from
[37:02] and take that route and then go to
[37:04] christchurch so i was already you know
[37:07] really demoralized i was really not
[37:10] happy because i was i could see that i
[37:12] was missing the service time and it was
[37:14] only two hours to crush it and now i
[37:16] have to make a detour that will take me
[37:17] about three hours in so i was not in my
[37:20] right mind and i kept on saying why lord
[37:22] why only today when i'm trying to go to
[37:24] church really so i went back and
[37:28] on my way i was like okay i'll have to
[37:30] stop and call pastor greg and tell him
[37:32] you know what i may not make it to
[37:34] service because the road is blocked and
[37:35] i have to take a detour
[37:37] and but i kept on going because i
[37:39] couldn't find the stock bay
[37:41] and uh just to stop my kind and and and
[37:44] make that call so i kept going and
[37:48] my gps didn't like the route i took so i
[37:50] didn't recognize where i was going and
[37:52] it kept on telling me to make a detour
[37:54] and i kept on going i was like you need
[37:56] to find a way for me out there so i kept
[37:58] on going
[37:59] and
[38:00] somehow the gps got tired of telling me
[38:03] to make a u-turn
[38:04] it showed me a road actually it got me
[38:06] lost so in road that led to no way and
[38:11] so when i got to the road there was no
[38:13] signage it was really a very forgotten
[38:16] road as most of the south island roads
[38:18] are some of them not most but some of
[38:20] them so it was a forgotten road so i
[38:22] took the road
[38:24] and there was no enough enough signage
[38:26] and
[38:27] yeah so i didn't know that i'll just
[38:30] suddenly
[38:31] leave the ground this the sealed road
[38:34] and hit the shingle there were no
[38:36] signage nothing so i was at normal speed
[38:38] about
[38:39] 100 100 yeah as we drive we all driving
[38:43] the highway i think
[38:46] so i yeah i i left the sil road straight
[38:49] hit the gravel without knowing and the
[38:52] moment i hit the gravel i lost control i
[38:54] was panicking the car couldn't stay the
[38:56] speed was not appropriate for the gravel
[38:58] road
[38:59] so yeah a lot of things went wrong the
[39:02] panic and everything it's when i have
[39:04] the flashback it sometimes really scares
[39:06] me
[39:07] when you're sometimes watching a movie
[39:09] that big bang that comes in so the car
[39:12] just took off and started flipping i
[39:14] think we flipped three or four times and
[39:17] like rolled the car rolled and ended up
[39:19] in the paddock
[39:21] and i was unconscious i was gone
[39:24] so
[39:25] my son was 10 years old
[39:28] he and he was awake he tried to walk me
[39:31] up i was not waking up i was not opening
[39:33] he said to me mom you had your eyes wide
[39:35] open and mouth open and you were not
[39:36] responding
[39:38] and then he left the car too they they
[39:41] they sit the frame that i put in the
[39:43] back of the the car
[39:45] is a pram that push the pressure allow
[39:48] the prime to push the door the back door
[39:50] open
[39:51] and that back door the one that allowed
[39:53] my kids my son to go out and seek help
[39:56] because yeah
[39:58] and all the flipping that happened
[40:00] the car seats were just sitting there my
[40:03] babies were sitting there in the same
[40:05] place
[40:06] you know yeah yeah
[40:08] yeah so it was really yeah terrible one
[40:12] all the windows were broken and so my
[40:15] car my kid my son left and went to the
[40:17] main road walked up to the main road and
[40:19] saw
[40:20] some fuzz farmers passing by and asked
[40:22] them please come and help us we had a
[40:24] cat crush so they were coming back with
[40:26] the farmers when i regained i started
[40:28] regaining consciousness i had blood
[40:30] flipping on my head because i had
[40:32] concussion i had blood
[40:34] on my arm and so i saw when i woke up i
[40:37] came back to life for me it was like a
[40:38] big dream like i was in the dream and i
[40:41] was i even started praying saying oh
[40:43] lord this is a very bad dream don't let
[40:44] it happen
[40:46] but actually when i heard my kids at the
[40:49] bed crying my mama i was like oh god
[40:51] it's not a dream really we are in the
[40:53] car crash and i could look all the
[40:54] windows were broken so i took my car my
[40:56] kids out
[40:57] and the farmers who came they helped us
[41:00] live and they called the policemen the
[41:02] policeman was when he came he was like
[41:04] oh
[41:05] this place again we just lost somebody
[41:07] here at 6 30 at the same spot and it was
[41:11] a young man driving and i think probably
[41:12] also got lost and in his report he said
[41:15] please uh nzta please put some enough
[41:18] signage on this road because of this too
[41:21] but for me when
[41:23] you came he thought you would find
[41:25] dead bodies or maybe some people very
[41:27] badly injured but
[41:29] it was me and my three little kid
[41:31] looking at him and he was so amazed to
[41:33] see us in that state so i thank the lord
[41:36] i really thank the lord for that and
[41:40] yeah
[41:43] yeah i don't know what why he kept me
[41:45] still here but probably still have
[41:47] something to do with me because
[41:49] i would have gone home that day and yeah
[41:52] so i thank god for that and for all the
[41:54] marvelous things he has done for me
[41:56] being here i went through a lot of
[41:57] trials
[41:58] flooding and stuff but
[42:01] the lord still kept us kept us here and
[42:04] and well so

[59:28] this morning
[59:31] amen amen amen
[59:34] amen let us pray father we
[59:37] thank you this morning god that we can
[59:38] be found in your presence lord
[59:41] what a beautiful song father
[59:43] heal a healer healer
[59:45] mighty mighty mighty
[59:47] father god and we stand this morning
[59:49] lord
[59:50] we are beneficiaries of your victory
[59:54] you fought the battle
[59:56] you paid the price
[59:58] we enjoy the rewards
[1:00:00] lord what a what a what an exchange
[1:00:02] father what an exchange
[1:00:04] god we don't have to die
[1:00:06] we don't have to pay the price you did
[1:00:09] that for us jesus
[1:00:10] and all you say this morning step into
[1:00:13] it and so father god that's what we're
[1:00:15] doing this morning lord we're stepping
[1:00:17] into your grace we're stepping into the
[1:00:21] mighty god we serve we we're stepping
[1:00:23] into the healing we're stepping into the
[1:00:26] victory lord we stepping into the joy
[1:00:29] we're stepping into your grace lord and
[1:00:31] we're enjoying it father and we want to
[1:00:33] say thank you lord and i pray father may
[1:00:36] you bless the reading of your word and
[1:00:38] may you bless whatever shall be said and
[1:00:39] done lord and take man of the scene
[1:00:41] father and lord i may have things
[1:00:43] written here lord god but that doesn't
[1:00:46] matter father as the new faces differ
[1:00:48] the needs the lord it's all about you
[1:00:51] and the people father lord i just want
[1:00:54] to be the the microphone that you speak
[1:00:56] through this morning so father may the
[1:00:59] believers realize whatever they need
[1:01:01] they can have what they need as long as
[1:01:04] they sit with expectations saying god
[1:01:08] you speak to me father so it depends
[1:01:10] upon their expectation it depends
[1:01:13] whether they came with a teaspoon or a
[1:01:16] cup or a drum depends on their
[1:01:19] expectation lord so whatever they're
[1:01:22] expecting this morning god they can have
[1:01:25] lord our prophet taught us that the
[1:01:27] minister doesn't bring the revival he
[1:01:30] doesn't pack it with him you said god

[1:01:35] father so if anybody leaves you this
[1:01:37] morning saying i got nothing it's not on
[1:01:41] me father it's on them this morning so
[1:01:44] father anointer speaker and the year is
[1:01:46] alike bless the reading of your word and
[1:01:50] take man of the scene father and may you
[1:01:52] be seen this morning god as we look to

[1:04:45] so i enjoy when seth and michael didn't
[1:04:47] come to my home
[1:04:49] i i let him do all the things the
[1:04:51] parents don't want them to do
[1:04:54] i get great joy out of it i really do i
[1:04:56] mean always in the world right
[1:04:59] and
[1:05:00] so we've got those massive lolli jars at
[1:05:02] home
[1:05:03] we fill it
[1:05:05] hey man
[1:05:06] we let them sleep whatever time they
[1:05:08] want to go to bed and
[1:05:11] yeah and we just love what they meant so
[1:05:15] yeah we love we love the kids we love
[1:05:17] the kids but it's not so nice you can
[1:05:18] tell okay now you go home now
[1:05:21] good amen and uh and kids they just grow
[1:05:24] so quick and so fast and
[1:05:26] i mean one minute they're little ones
[1:05:27] and then now it's in our home there's
[1:05:29] six adults right
[1:05:31] myself and jenny mom and dad and the
[1:05:33] girls came and named me so they're six
[1:05:35] adults and we
[1:05:36] we can't dictate anymore we can't tell
[1:05:38] them what we want no no we get tall now
[1:05:40] mom and dad i'm an adult
[1:05:43] so uh it's it's it's a different
[1:05:46] it's different dynamics now
[1:05:48] and and as a parent you you adapt
[1:05:51] and and so the kids are you know when
[1:05:53] they get to a certain age there you know
[1:05:55] i mean they you get to teens they're
[1:05:57] hormonal and they're changing life you
[1:05:59] know what i mean and likewise we as
[1:06:01] parents do
[1:06:02] i mean we haven't been this way before
[1:06:04] right
[1:06:04] i i don't know what it's like to have
[1:06:06] you know we i mean
[1:06:07] amy amy's 23 sorry amy i mean she's 23
[1:06:12] and
[1:06:13] i don't know we you know kim is
[1:06:16] okay 28. i mean and and so this this is
[1:06:20] my first time through this
[1:06:22] it's my i mean my first time i've never
[1:06:23] been through there before so we learned
[1:06:25] so it's as much pressure on us as
[1:06:27] parents as on the kids and sometimes i
[1:06:29] think the kids need to acknowledge that
[1:06:31] you know it's always a little appearance
[1:06:36] but sometimes kids you need to
[1:06:37] acknowledge youngsters you need to
[1:06:39] acknowledge that we're learning
[1:06:41] and we make a mess and we make we make a
[1:06:43] mess
[1:06:44] but we always have your well-being and
[1:06:46] heart
[1:06:47] you may not think that
[1:06:49] you may not thank you brother onions you
[1:06:51] may not believe that but we mean well
[1:06:55] and we

[1:07:00] to move you know my shall we do this can

[1:07:09] that it's like no mommy don't daddy

[1:12:14] when i was brother ben asked me to
[1:12:15] minister and i was coming up
[1:12:17] coming i was thinking about the lord
[1:12:19] what i speak on i mean you could go to
[1:12:21] all the notes and things and this stuff
[1:12:23] i thought man maybe i'll preach last
[1:12:24] week's sunday sermon i thought ah
[1:12:27] you know certain people are going to
[1:12:28] pull me up on that
[1:12:29] and um
[1:12:31] so i i i think god's got a sense of
[1:12:33] humor
[1:12:35] and and so i was sitting with you know
[1:12:37] you toy with two white thoughts two
[1:12:39] trains of thought lord which way do you
[1:12:41] go and so tuesday night i said okay lord
[1:12:43] i prayed i said lord please brother
[1:12:45] morgan minister i said please use
[1:12:46] brother morgan to point me in the
[1:12:49] direction i said please lord
[1:12:51] and then we were sitting in church and
[1:12:53] we'd do our tears there's a zoom and
[1:12:54] then brother morgan preached
[1:12:56] oh man and he preached in the he went in
[1:12:59] the direction where i felt manual
[1:13:01] he spoke on the one of the thoughts i
[1:13:03] had and i thought oh lord thank you
[1:13:05] that's where what you want me to speak
[1:13:06] on
[1:13:07] now man god is so great ten minutes
[1:13:10] later he spoke on the second thought i
[1:13:12] had
[1:13:16] so now i said that
[1:13:18] and then he ends the sermon saying this
[1:13:20] you need to hear the voice of god
[1:13:24] so i i left the service on tuesday just
[1:13:27] as
[1:13:28] lord what are you gonna do so really i
[1:13:30] came here this morning i've got two
[1:13:32] sermons here right here and i've got the
[1:13:34] sets of quotes with both sermons and i
[1:13:36] said lord when i'm finished praying
[1:13:37] you're gonna give me direction
[1:13:39] all right i've never done that and then
[1:13:41] someone i said well maybe i should just
[1:13:42] combine the two sermons
[1:13:45] so we'll we'll see how we go
[1:13:47] this is about
[1:13:48] uh uh probably four or five hours a year
[1:13:51] i've got but i will never be that long
[1:13:53] amen and i watched my clock i did ask
[1:13:55] for the kuben what time uh and brother
[1:13:57] koben said no time and he said there's
[1:13:59] no clock at the back but i said i have
[1:14:00] my watch with me
[1:14:02] amen and that's why i've got my phone
[1:14:03] here i don't not to check textures for
[1:14:05] the time
[1:14:07] because i always say you know we a lot
[1:14:08] of people say oh brother we're living in
[1:14:10] eternity i said ah
[1:14:12] this body is still in time this body is
[1:14:14] still in time and you get a certain time
[1:14:17] and people start going home in the
[1:14:18] spirit
[1:14:19] their bodies are here and you can see
[1:14:22] look it's on your face
[1:14:24] really it's on your face believe me it's
[1:14:27] we we carry that on our faces so if i
[1:14:30] say something that offends you you'll
[1:14:31] tell yourself i'm not going to show it
[1:14:33] you'll show it
[1:14:34] serious you'll show it it's on your face
[1:14:36] right and a lot of times you look at me
[1:14:38] the minister preaches you look at me and
[1:14:40] i can see you've left
[1:14:42] i look at your face and i can see you've
[1:14:45] gone home you've left amen
[1:14:48] and so we we have to have church now
[1:14:50] with our mosques on in there because
[1:14:51] we're using a council hall
[1:14:53] and so you just see the eyes of the
[1:14:55] believers and i was telling them last
[1:14:57] week you don't know if they're smiling
[1:14:58] at you if they're grimacing at you
[1:15:00] they're frowning at you if they don't
[1:15:02] like what you're saying i say well you
[1:15:05] know but it doesn't really matter jude
[1:15:07] god told jeremiah don't look at their
[1:15:09] faces saying
[1:15:10] so i'm just happy to be here this
[1:15:12] morning
[1:15:13] amen and um i promise you i won't belong
[1:15:16] this with you this morning but as the
[1:15:17] lord leads amen
[1:15:19] so you pray for us amen but you're happy
[1:15:21] right
[1:15:23] it's good to be alive
[1:15:25] it's good to be healthy right
[1:15:27] amen with a number of things happening
[1:15:29] and you know but you know it's good but
[1:15:30] a little thought this morning i i
[1:15:33] promise you it's not a it's not a
[1:15:34] christmas message but i want to bring a
[1:15:36] thought this one if god will help us and
[1:15:38] we just see how we go and
[1:15:39] you know i i'm i'm still old school and
[1:15:42] i like tell the church i said i write
[1:15:44] out my notes
[1:15:45] and i'm old school i i watch your
[1:15:47] meetings and i see uh brother amand uses
[1:15:50] that thing and
[1:15:51] brother samson uses that thing and they
[1:15:53] got the little pointer and the and the
[1:15:55] mic over here and
[1:15:57] sorry i'm old school eh
[1:15:59] i still i still write out my notes and
[1:16:02] you know and uh that's just the way i i
[1:16:04] do stuff i like the i like the
[1:16:06] simplicity of the gospel that's my
[1:16:08] that's my revelation right i like so i i
[1:16:11] get great joy sitting down on a sand and
[1:16:13] saturday night i put together things on
[1:16:15] pieces of paper during the week and just
[1:16:17] sitting down and just putting it
[1:16:18] together now watch out god put it
[1:16:19] together i just love that you know and
[1:16:23] everyone to their own a but this morning
[1:16:25] little thought to encourage you and
[1:16:27] hopefully trust the lord will be a
[1:16:28] blessing amen we'll take it out of out
[1:16:30] of matthew 1 verse 18 and it simply says
[1:16:33] the birth of jesus christ was on this
[1:16:36] wise
[1:16:37] now i know you think brother this is
[1:16:39] christmas but you'll realize we want to
[1:16:41] try and let you know when you leave here
[1:16:43] this morning where you are in this
[1:16:45] journey
[1:16:46] because you know we're on a journey
[1:16:50] and uh and for a little inspiration i
[1:16:52] want to leave with you and the child
[1:16:54] grew
[1:16:55] and waxed strong
[1:16:57] in spirit
[1:16:58] because you see we we can't stay on one
[1:17:01] place
[1:17:02] you need to have a testimony that says
[1:17:05] brother i ain't what i was
[1:17:08] you know what i mean i'm not what i
[1:17:10] ought to be
[1:17:11] but thank god i can look back and i can
[1:17:13] see there's progress in my life
[1:17:17] i believe a christian's life is about
[1:17:19] progress
[1:17:20] a christian's walk is about you move
[1:17:23] from point a to point b
[1:17:25] you you cannot be stagnant you cannot be
[1:17:28] sitting there and say brother i got
[1:17:30] saved 20 years ago and i'm still
[1:17:32] struggling with cigarettes but you can't
[1:17:35] you can't 20 years later say i'm still
[1:17:37] struggling with dressing and i'm
[1:17:39] struggling with this and i'm no there's
[1:17:41] got to be some progress in your life
[1:17:44] because i believe god is coming for a
[1:17:46] perfect bride
[1:17:48] i believe the bride on the earth today
[1:17:50] needs to be adopted
[1:17:53] that's what i believe this morning you
[1:17:54] know and i and i see what's happening in
[1:17:56] the world and i you know and i will
[1:17:58] never ever belittle what is happening
[1:18:01] but i made a promise to god i said god i
[1:18:03] will not preach on what's happening in
[1:18:06] the world because the world brother
[1:18:08] brown says the world is in the in the
[1:18:10] end time conditions
[1:18:12] but i will say i will focus on the
[1:18:14] condition that brother branham said the
[1:18:16] bride should be
[1:18:18] and i love this quote brother branham
[1:18:19] says you always talk about how bad the
[1:18:22] world is
[1:18:23] how wicked the world is he says that's
[1:18:26] true but then he says but look how great
[1:18:29] the church is getting all the time
[1:18:33] and i said lord that's my focus
[1:18:37] anybody want to preach about russia and
[1:18:39] ukraine nothing wrong
[1:18:41] you do that but i said my call is lord
[1:18:44] i'm gonna see where the bride is
[1:18:46] because i want to say if this is the
[1:18:49] fulfillment of prophecy where should the
[1:18:52] bride be
[1:18:55] because russia and ukraine is the
[1:18:57] backdrop
[1:19:04] they the backdrop
[1:19:06] the main characters is the bride
[1:19:11] because if los angeles is ready to sink
[1:19:14] i'm not supposed to be here
[1:19:17] and in other words there's got to be a
[1:19:19] resurrection
[1:19:21] then there's got to be a 30 40 day
[1:19:23] period where brother branham visits
[1:19:25] visits well wellington assembly
[1:19:28] where the dead in christ arises
[1:19:31] when those that are dead or alive
[1:19:33] when they walk into the building and
[1:19:36] when they walk in there'll be no gray
[1:19:38] hair
[1:19:40] when they walk in there'll be no old
[1:19:42] people
[1:19:43] when they walk in brother 30 won't be
[1:19:45] bald
[1:19:46] when they walk in i'm going to be a
[1:19:48] young man because i bring the
[1:19:51] resurrection
[1:19:57] did you know what i said
[1:19:59] you bring the resurrection
[1:20:01] so we need to come into a certain
[1:20:03] condition
[1:20:05] to bring the dead out of the grave
[1:20:07] to bring brother branama to the grave if
[1:20:10] you've lost loved ones you need to get
[1:20:12] into a condition
[1:20:14] to get them out of the grave
[1:20:18] and then they're going to come walking
[1:20:20] into church
[1:20:22] is going to walk in you with that hat
[1:20:23] and he's going to take his hat off and
[1:20:24] say god bless you my brother
[1:20:27] and we're going to be young
[1:20:29] i don't know what brother honest looks
[1:20:30] like when he's a young man but i'll know
[1:20:32] him
[1:20:34] you may not know me when i had hair on
[1:20:35] my head but you'll know me
[1:20:37] oh brother prime of our youth
[1:20:40] shoulders back
[1:20:42] hey man brother branson but look how
[1:20:44] great the church is getting listen to
[1:20:46] this so when the world gets wickeder
[1:20:49] that's the brother brandon's words and
[1:20:51] weaker
[1:20:52] and wicked
[1:20:54] he says the church
[1:20:56] is getting more powerful
[1:20:58] and powerful
[1:21:00] all the time
[1:21:03] so you mean you mean you are a devil
[1:21:05] killer
[1:21:07] you mean you walk over covet
[1:21:10] you mean you trample over cancer
[1:21:13] you mean you overcome lust
[1:21:15] you mean you overcome the world
[1:21:17] you mean you victorious
[1:21:20] you mean you are more than a conqueror
[1:21:22] because brother well brother branham
[1:21:24] said that
[1:21:25] we're getting more powerful
[1:21:27] more powerful
[1:21:29] more powerful he says you always
[1:21:32] pointing how wicked the world is getting
[1:21:34] but fail to see how powerful the church
[1:21:37] is getting
[1:21:38] at the same time
[1:21:41] i promise god that's my focus
[1:21:45] russia will do its thing america will do
[1:21:47] its thing the purple curtain will do its
[1:21:49] thing the king of the north will do its
[1:21:51] thing and we'll do our thing
[1:21:54] that's my focus where's the bride
[1:21:57] what condition is she in what's the
[1:21:59] condition of the young people are they
[1:22:01] free are they victorious are they
[1:22:03] overcoming
[1:22:05] that's what we're after man
[1:22:07] amen and what does what does us
[1:22:09] old-timers doing
[1:22:11] brother we're fighting this good fight
[1:22:12] huh
[1:22:16] only brother onyears and brother samson
[1:22:18] said amen because they identify
[1:22:20] themselves as
[1:22:21] but brother we are
[1:22:23] i'm a right reverend we are caleb's
[1:22:25] right and may we we may look old
[1:22:29] but the bible says we are stronger than
[1:22:30] ever
[1:22:31] [Applause]
[1:22:34] caleb was in the message for 40 years
[1:22:37] he walked with a prophet message for 40
[1:22:39] years
[1:22:40] and one day
[1:22:42] caleb got annoyed
[1:22:44] just looking at his mountain
[1:22:47] don't you sometimes feel that way
[1:22:50] don't you sometimes when you see what
[1:22:51] the enemy does to your children you just
[1:22:53] get angry
[1:22:55] i can imagine caleb came to church that
[1:22:57] morning brother ben
[1:22:59] amen and the holy ghost brother ben was
[1:23:01] behind the pulpit and caleb walked to
[1:23:03] church that morning and he said i want
[1:23:05] my mountain
[1:23:06] i wonder what is mine
[1:23:08] you see he had been looking at this
[1:23:10] mountain for 40 years he'd been
[1:23:12] wandering around this mountain for 40
[1:23:15] years he'd been quoting the promises for
[1:23:17] 40 years but he got to a place
[1:23:20] and he said enough was enough
[1:23:27] what is that guy of destiny church they
[1:23:29] went chanting down the street enough was
[1:23:31] enough
[1:23:32] enough was enough
[1:23:33] and that's what the bride should be
[1:23:36] caleb said man and he walked up to
[1:23:37] joshua he said hey joshua i'm not asking
[1:23:40] for permission
[1:23:42] i'm not coming to ask you is it okay
[1:23:45] i just want you to know what i'm doing i
[1:23:48] want what is mine
[1:23:50] i want what is mine
[1:23:52] what is yours this morning
[1:23:55] watch your mountain
[1:23:59] oh my that's my focus the world is
[1:24:01] getting more powerful and powerful
[1:24:03] mind jesus increased in wisdom and
[1:24:05] stature
[1:24:06] oh man and this is what i'm looking at
[1:24:08] this morning a powerful church amen
[1:24:11] oh my not a wake church
[1:24:13] not we are not losers church
[1:24:19] let's try that again
[1:24:20] we are not losers
[1:24:26] god bless those are today amen
[1:24:28] but i mean we are not church
[1:24:30] because if russia is fulfilling the
[1:24:32] promises the prophecy
[1:24:34] if
[1:24:36] americans will fall in prophecy if rome
[1:24:38] is fulfilling prophecy if the world is
[1:24:41] fulfilling prophecy if second timothy 3
[1:24:43] is being in fulfillment then where
[1:24:46] should the bride be
[1:24:49] ask yourself that question
[1:24:51] because the world is in place
[1:24:54] brother
[1:24:55] oh didn't brother branham say the
[1:24:57] minister hell
[1:24:59] i thank god i'm not a minister right
[1:25:01] thank god i'm not a minister i'm just a
[1:25:02] witness
[1:25:03] brother branham said the world
[1:25:05] am i not quoted correctly but he said
[1:25:06] the world is in the condition of the end
[1:25:08] time
[1:25:10] but he says but the ministers
[1:25:12] fail to get the people
[1:25:15] into end time conditions
[1:25:20] so ministers
[1:25:23] i don't know the ministers amen but i
[1:25:25] thank god we're just witnesses right
[1:25:27] but i believe the bride is on she's on
[1:25:30] our way
[1:25:32] and then brother brandon you see brother
[1:25:33] branham had that vision
[1:25:35] of the bride marching amen
[1:25:37] she wasn't wasting time she was marching
[1:25:40] she wasn't counting time she was
[1:25:42] marching
[1:25:43] and she was marching upwards brother
[1:25:46] oh man she wasn't singing i'm a loser
[1:25:48] she wasn't singing i'm a failure
[1:25:51] she was singing onward christian
[1:25:52] soldiers
[1:25:54] do you know you're a soldier
[1:25:57] you know sometimes we need to look at
[1:25:58] ourselves in the mirror and preach to
[1:26:00] ourselves
[1:26:01] you need to point out that guy in the
[1:26:03] mirror and say do you know you were a
[1:26:04] soldier
[1:26:06] do you know you're an overcomer
[1:26:08] do you know that greater is he
[1:26:10] that is in you
[1:26:12] than he that is
[1:26:15] have you ever preached to yourself yes
[1:26:19] you preach to yourself amen
[1:26:21] when last did you stand in front of the
[1:26:23] mirror
[1:26:26] let's be honest now let's be honest
[1:26:28] when lost did you stand in front of the
[1:26:30] mirror other than to get your hair right
[1:26:34] other than to pull your tie straight
[1:26:36] when lasted you stand in front of the
[1:26:38] mirror and preach to yourself
[1:26:41] point at that person in the mirror and
[1:26:43] say man you are more than an overcomer
[1:26:46] you should try sometimes
[1:26:48] it works
[1:26:50] point to yourself and rebuke yourself
[1:26:53] say stop being slothful
[1:26:55] stop being a weakling
[1:26:57] pull up your socks
[1:26:59] put your shoulders back lift your head
[1:27:02] in the air preach to yourself
[1:27:04] and tell yourself the word of god is
[1:27:07] stronger than ever
[1:27:10] it may not look like it it may not seem
[1:27:13] like it but the word of god can defeat
[1:27:16] satan any time under any condition the
[1:27:21] word of god
[1:27:23] that's right just preach to yourself
[1:27:26] speak to yourself
[1:27:28] amen and your rebuke tell yourself you
[1:27:29] slothful thing
[1:27:32] and after you rebuked yourself now you
[1:27:34] tell yourself the promises
[1:27:36] brother take the bible and preach to
[1:27:38] yourself man read to yourself the
[1:27:40] promises
[1:27:42] and you'll find after a while your
[1:27:43] shoulders will go back your head will go
[1:27:46] in the air because my question to you is
[1:27:49] can this word
[1:27:50] help you overcome
[1:27:52] is this word powerful enough is this
[1:27:55] word strong enough is this word great
[1:27:58] enough i say yes it is
[1:28:01] do you know what brother branham said
[1:28:03] how to overcome
[1:28:05] he said number one recognize there's a
[1:28:07] devil
[1:28:08] number one
[1:28:09] to overcome and number two he said
[1:28:11] recognize that the god in you
[1:28:15] is greater
[1:28:16] and stronger
[1:28:18] and more powerful than the force against
[1:28:20] you
[1:28:23] and then brother branson number three
[1:28:25] recognize him at his tricks
[1:28:28] recognize him at his tricks a man amen
[1:28:30] now you when your brother comes against
[1:28:33] you your brother's not the devil
[1:28:35] don't call your brother the devil when
[1:28:37] your wife upsets you don't say wife you
[1:28:39] a devil
[1:28:40] no no no no it's how you react
[1:28:44] it's how you react to the situation
[1:28:47] you know we don't want to go around
[1:28:48] calling each other devils and devils no
[1:28:50] you recognize him
[1:28:52] and then you realize he's greater he's
[1:28:54] stronger he's more powerful amen and
[1:28:58] brother behind the bible says the
[1:28:59] preaching of the cross
[1:29:01] amen the preaching of the cross and this
[1:29:03] is what we're doing this morning just
[1:29:05] reminding you
[1:29:07] of who you
[1:29:09] and are
[1:29:09] by the bible says the birth of jesus
[1:29:11] christ
[1:29:13] the bible is very specific you know the
[1:29:15] bible and nothing i can tell you to know
[1:29:17] the bible is very specific of how this
[1:29:20] event happened
[1:29:21] and i'll take you through it amen and
[1:29:23] and the visitation is very specific
[1:29:26] and if you go and you look at luke 1
[1:29:28] verse 26 to 38 we don't have to turn
[1:29:30] there but the bible says this in the
[1:29:32] sixth month
[1:29:34] of elizabeth's pregnancy
[1:29:36] very specific the angel was sent
[1:29:41] just a little bit a little bit of
[1:29:43] background if you allow me
[1:29:45] so it was the angel gabriel that was
[1:29:47] sent
[1:29:48] the bible says when
[1:29:51] the bible says who was sent
[1:29:54] and the bible says from whom it was sent
[1:29:57] right and the bible even says to where
[1:30:00] it was sent
[1:30:02] i just love god amen he says when he
[1:30:05] says who
[1:30:07] from who and to whom
[1:30:10] my so it was the sixth month of
[1:30:12] elizabeth's pregnancy the angel gabriel
[1:30:15] came sent from god and to a city of
[1:30:18] galilee called nazareth
[1:30:20] and it carries on to a virgin named mary
[1:30:24] wow hamas
[1:30:26] to a virgin named mary engaged to joseph
[1:30:29] of the house of joseph
[1:30:32] how more specific than that can you be
[1:30:35] that with god there's no oops
[1:30:38] with god there's no maybe i'll find
[1:30:41] maybe i won't maybe what god there's
[1:30:43] nothing no no what god is
[1:30:46] six months
[1:30:47] angel gabriel
[1:30:48] god sent city of galilee oh my virgin
[1:30:52] name mary engaged to joseph
[1:30:55] specific
[1:30:57] god deals with specifics
[1:31:00] and so god when he wanted an overcomer
[1:31:03] he said man i'm going to put a name down
[1:31:07] and i'm going to put that name in a book
[1:31:10] oh my and that names will never be lost
[1:31:15] and then he said i'm gonna find them
[1:31:17] wherever they are
[1:31:20] oh
[1:31:21] my
[1:31:22] isn't that awesome amen that you are
[1:31:24] where you are because god found you
[1:31:28] god went looking for you
[1:31:30] god didn't care your family you were
[1:31:32] born in
[1:31:33] god didn't care that was all part of the
[1:31:35] plan
[1:31:36] amen god didn't care where you came from
[1:31:39] god didn't care he whether you were
[1:31:41] hindu or muslim or arabic or oh you come
[1:31:46] from tamba too oh my that didn't matter
[1:31:49] because it wasn't about this guy it's
[1:31:51] about that seed of representing
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:59] i have a question for the believers here
[1:32:01] do you believe in predestination
[1:32:04] amen
[1:32:05] i see this side does this sign you
[1:32:07] believe
[1:32:08] praise the lord so you believe that god
[1:32:11] wrote your name
[1:32:13] in the eternal book
[1:32:16] before the foundation of the world
[1:32:18] do you believe that you have
[1:32:20] representation with god from eternity
[1:32:25] do you believe that you are before the
[1:32:27] devil
[1:32:30] do you know the devil's being created
[1:32:33] but you were not
[1:32:34] you were represented
[1:32:36] in the mind of god
[1:32:38] before the foundation of the world
[1:32:41] and here you are this morning just an
[1:32:44] expression
[1:32:45] of what god had in his mind
[1:32:49] some of you don't believe that
[1:32:51] that's all right that's all right
[1:32:53] not my job to make you believe it
[1:32:55] that's brother ben's job
[1:32:57] and the minister's jobs don't mind i
[1:32:59] just preach what the word says amen that
[1:33:02] you were represented as a thought
[1:33:06] because brother branham said he said
[1:33:07] when god started the process of creation
[1:33:11] he said he believes the first thing he
[1:33:14] created was angels
[1:33:17] right
[1:33:18] he says why they needed to worship god
[1:33:21] right
[1:33:22] so they were the created
[1:33:25] but we were a thought
[1:33:28] but my bible says he chose me in him
[1:33:34] not created me
[1:33:36] he chose me in him
[1:33:39] before
[1:33:42] the devil he was created
[1:33:46] but i was before
[1:33:50] he chose me
[1:33:53] so before you messed up
[1:33:56] before you were an addict
[1:33:58] before you were what you are before your
[1:34:01] he chose
[1:34:02] you and then he said you know what and
[1:34:05] he said you know what and now i'm you're
[1:34:07] going to be born in south africa i
[1:34:09] better talk about me you're going to be
[1:34:10] born in south africa your mom's last
[1:34:13] name is going to be tabisha your dad is
[1:34:15] going to be esau what a terrible son
[1:34:16] surname i always say but that didn't
[1:34:18] matter to god
[1:34:20] god wasn't concerned about this guy
[1:34:23] we're very concerned about this guy
[1:34:26] i don't like how you look i don't like
[1:34:28] this i don't know god didn't care about
[1:34:30] this
[1:34:31] god didn't care that he took a tapasha
[1:34:33] and an esau to make this
[1:34:36] don't blame if this doesn't look
[1:34:38] appropriate
[1:34:39] blame god
[1:34:42] amen all right
[1:34:44] blame god but we're so focused on this
[1:34:47] we don't realize that behind this
[1:34:50] there's a real me
[1:34:54] so i don't care if you don't like the
[1:34:56] out of me
[1:34:57] god loves the enemy god loves the real
[1:35:01] me
[1:35:02] so god took some tavisha dust and some
[1:35:04] ease of dust and he made it to come
[1:35:06] together and he had a ferdi
[1:35:09] but inside of that furry there was a
[1:35:11] seed
[1:35:12] of representation
[1:35:14] amen and and the predestination and
[1:35:17] grace of god it was wrapped around the
[1:35:19] throne of god and then god went fishing
[1:35:25] and god knew that on the other side of
[1:35:27] the hook there was a seed
[1:35:31] and that seed was born in south africa
[1:35:33] cape town
[1:35:35] and that seed walked the world earth
[1:35:37] and that seed did his thing
[1:35:40] 16 elements but inside there was a seed
[1:35:42] a man and one day god said right time to
[1:35:44] come home
[1:35:48] somehow some of your situations are
[1:35:50] worse than mine
[1:35:52] some of you come out of a darker bestow
[1:35:54] we all mess
[1:35:58] let me start rolling
[1:36:00] and god stood there you see god like a
[1:36:01] fishing rod

[1:36:18] job for him he's got to pass the church

[1:36:25] didn't know it you brothers didn't know
[1:36:27] it and god started reeling you in
[1:36:29] and then you said i just decided to come
[1:36:32] to church this morning you liar
[1:36:35] part of the plan of god part of the you
[1:36:38] said brother my mess-ups is part of the
[1:36:41] yes it's part of the plan
[1:36:42] you said brother my mistakes oh yes he's

[1:41:00] malachi 4 5-6
[1:41:02] behold what an announcement
[1:41:06] i sinned who was the i god
[1:41:09] send you who's the you funny
[1:41:14] okay by the rest of you that you freddie
[1:41:17] i'm sorry i'm selfish he says i send you
[1:41:20] ferdi elijah the prophet
[1:41:24] brother that's my visitation amen oh my
[1:41:28] the angel knew your name
[1:41:30] the angel knew your name the angel knew
[1:41:32] where to find you oh my so the angel was
[1:41:36] gabriel came to mary and the angel
[1:41:39] gabriel came with the words of the
[1:41:41] prophet
[1:41:43] oh my and presented the words of the
[1:41:46] prophet
[1:41:48] to the church mary
[1:41:50] that's what the angel did amen
[1:41:52] oh my what did isaiah say a virgin shall
[1:41:57] conceive
[1:41:59] his name shall be emmanuel
[1:42:01] and to us a child is born shall call his
[1:42:04] name wonderful and counselor and mighty
[1:42:07] god
[1:42:09] and what do we say his name was jesus
[1:42:12] isaiah just said a virgin
[1:42:15] isaiah just said wonderful counselor
[1:42:18] mighty god
[1:42:20] the angel said jesus
[1:42:23] oh my what was the angel doing he took
[1:42:26] the words of the prophet
[1:42:28] and he brought it to the church the
[1:42:30] bride mary but he made made more sense
[1:42:33] to it
[1:42:34] listen what brother branham said brother
[1:42:35] branham said now watch
[1:42:37] god doesn't have to do anything more to
[1:42:40] make it more appealing the only thing he
[1:42:42] has to do is just raise up a standard of
[1:42:45] his own word against the enemy when the
[1:42:48] bible says when the enemy comes in like
[1:42:50] a flood the spirit of god raises the
[1:42:52] standard of it against it what does he
[1:42:54] do he makes the word that is already
[1:42:58] said more positive
[1:43:02] so here was the word of isaiah
[1:43:04] a virgin shall conceive right that was
[1:43:06] the word
[1:43:07] they needed a standard
[1:43:09] they needed a messiah year
[1:43:10] so what did the what did the angel do in
[1:43:12] the middle he took the word of isaiah
[1:43:15] that word that was already said and he
[1:43:18] made it more positive and what was it he
[1:43:20] put it in flesh
[1:43:22] that's what he did amen and so today
[1:43:26] the virgin we call her mary
[1:43:28] did isaiah call him berry
[1:43:30] did isaiah say her name was mary did
[1:43:33] isaiah say his name was jesus no oh no
[1:43:36] the angel said that so the angel picked
[1:43:39] up the word that was written brought
[1:43:42] into our day made more sense
[1:43:45] and malachi 4 wrote behold i send you
[1:43:47] elijah the prophet
[1:43:49] he took the word that had already been
[1:43:52] spoken made it more positive
[1:43:54] and today we say oh william branham
[1:43:57] but we didn't know it was william
[1:43:59] branham back then when malachi
[1:44:00] wrote it
[1:44:02] malachi just got inspired and he wrote
[1:44:04] behold i sin unto you elijah the prophet
[1:44:07] he didn't know who the you was
[1:44:09] he didn't know today we know the you was
[1:44:11] thirty
[1:44:13] am i right
[1:44:14] we didn't know back then
[1:44:16] we didn't know that that you was brother
[1:44:18] armand
[1:44:19] oh brother matt oh my we didn't know
[1:44:22] that elijah was william branham
[1:44:24] but today we do
[1:44:26] me
[1:44:27] isaiah didn't know when he said a virgin
[1:44:30] shall conceive that she'll be called
[1:44:31] mary
[1:44:32] no no what did he do the angel
[1:44:36] gabriel
[1:44:37] took what had already been said
[1:44:40] and made it more positive
[1:44:42] and today we look back and we say oh
[1:44:44] that's mary
[1:44:46] today we look back at oh that was jesus
[1:44:50] and today we look back oh that was
[1:44:51] william branham
[1:44:53] and today we look back oh that's ferdi
[1:44:55] and today we're looking so that's birdie
[1:44:57] the bride
[1:44:58] and will turn his heart
[1:45:02] why what was happening
[1:45:04] he took the word that was spoken
[1:45:07] not new word that's why brother branham
[1:45:09] was so in the bible
[1:45:11] that's why brother branham would not
[1:45:12] deviate that's why brother branham stood
[1:45:15] on the word when everybody walked away
[1:45:18] brother branham knew he had to take the
[1:45:20] word that had already been spoken and
[1:45:23] bring it into our day
[1:45:26] oh my and everybody said oh praise the
[1:45:28] lord hey remember brother but mary
[1:45:31] brother i just i love that woman mary
[1:45:34] there's something about mary hey man she
[1:45:37] said how's this thing's gonna happen
[1:45:40] here's my question for you how's the
[1:45:42] word that you believe going to become
[1:45:44] flesh
[1:45:47] glory
[1:45:49] that's my question
[1:45:51] how's your family going to be saved
[1:45:55] how's your children going to be restored
[1:45:57] amen how are you gonna have a body
[1:45:59] change when every year you're getting
[1:46:00] older
[1:46:02] and every year you're becoming more
[1:46:04] stooped
[1:46:05] and you realize today you're closer to
[1:46:06] 70 than 21.
[1:46:09] how do you realize man when you turn
[1:46:11] fifth and you realize i'm closer home
[1:46:13] than what i was when i started
[1:46:15] how is that gonna happen that you're
[1:46:17] gonna turn from an old person to a young
[1:46:19] person
[1:46:22] and the world looks at you and says man
[1:46:23] you mad
[1:46:25] you are mad mad mad to believe stuff
[1:46:29] like that
[1:46:30] but i just say leave me alone
[1:46:33] leave me alone
[1:46:34] how did father abraham know when he
[1:46:36] looked at old sister
[1:46:46] you know what sister said
[1:46:48] she laughed
[1:46:50] and wrapped in that love is all your
[1:46:52] mistakes
[1:46:54] wrapped in that laugh it's all out
[1:46:56] backsliding and failures
[1:46:58] but you see janice said she laughed
[1:47:00] hebrews 11 didn't say she lie
[1:47:06] so when they tell my life story brother
[1:47:08] when my life story is read in heaven
[1:47:10] they're not going to say ferdi did this
[1:47:12] and freddie did that and oh no no no no
[1:47:15] no they're going to say in heaven fairly
[1:47:18] stood on the
[1:47:19] word is all
[1:47:22] that's all i want to be known as brother
[1:47:24] samson you want to be known as that we
[1:47:26] stood on the word we maybe never made
[1:47:28] good decisions maybe we messed as
[1:47:31] parents maybe we made this but all you
[1:47:33] stood on the word
[1:47:34] that's what i want them to write about
[1:47:36] me
[1:47:37] oh my there's a song they said so
[1:47:39] whenever anyone ever writes my life
[1:47:42] story
[1:47:44] i want them to write in my life story
[1:47:46] that jesus
[1:47:48] is the best thing that ever happened to
[1:47:50] ferdi
[1:47:52] there's a song the gator sing and if
[1:47:54] anyone ever writes my life story i want
[1:47:58] him to say that
[1:48:00] that jesus is the best thing that ever
[1:48:03] happened to me the fact that he never
[1:48:05] walked away from me
[1:48:07] that's what blows my mind
[1:48:09] that when i messed he never walked away
[1:48:13] oh man i made some stupid moves brother
[1:48:15] in the past but he never walked away
[1:48:18] so that's my song a man i wish i could
[1:48:20] sing it that jesus
[1:48:22] is the best thing
[1:48:24] that ever happened
[1:48:27] jesus
[1:48:28] is the best thing
[1:48:30] that ever happened
[1:48:32] jesus i'm wrong the tunei
[1:48:36] is the best not just you're looking at
[1:48:37] me like brother what you're trying
[1:48:42] that's how a singer looks at the
[1:48:43] non-singer
[1:48:44] what you're trying
[1:48:47] ah it's a beautiful sister that a man
[1:48:49] oh my
[1:48:52] where was i
[1:48:53] yes the best thing
[1:48:55] that ever happened
[1:48:57] and that's grace of god
[1:49:00] oh my
[1:49:02] that he called us
[1:49:04] and he sent william branham
[1:49:06] and if you listen to william branham's
[1:49:07] life and he would listen to him preach
[1:49:09] and he said other people walked away but
[1:49:11] he said i wouldn't deviate from that
[1:49:13] word
[1:49:14] why he was taking a word that had
[1:49:17] already been spoken and written and it
[1:49:20] was bringing it into our day making more
[1:49:22] sense to it
[1:49:24] him and they said bride he said you are
[1:49:27] the bride he is they called taste but
[1:49:29] nobody wanted to talk about
[1:49:31] predestination
[1:49:33] nobody
[1:49:34] in the denominational world wants to
[1:49:36] speak about predestination
[1:49:38] my brother branham picked that up and he
[1:49:40] said that's the foundation
[1:49:42] of your walk with god that god chose you
[1:49:46] in him before the foundation
[1:49:50] of the world
[1:49:51] that he chose you amen
[1:49:53] that's predestination on my quarter 212
[1:49:56] amen oh my i haven't started a man where
[1:49:58] were we but elijah came and he turned
[1:50:01] the hearts
[1:50:02] and malachi 4 stood on the word and he
[1:50:04] said that word is going to be real
[1:50:06] and brother branham goes along and he
[1:50:08] says not only does god come in with the
[1:50:12] learning of the word but he manifests
[1:50:15] that word
[1:50:16] and i want to let you know there's going
[1:50:18] to be a manifestation
[1:50:21] you sound like you're trying to work me
[1:50:23] up i'm not going to do that i'm too old
[1:50:24] for that
[1:50:26] i'm not going to spend my time trying to
[1:50:27] work you into a believing no i've got
[1:50:29] time for that as long as i believe
[1:50:32] you do what you want to do with the word
[1:50:34] but for us for me and my house
[1:50:37] this is where we stand
[1:50:38] brother branham took the word that had
[1:50:40] already been written and he brought into
[1:50:43] my day and he said it's yours
[1:50:46] gabriel what did gabriel do he picked up
[1:50:49] isaiah's prophecies
[1:50:51] am i right
[1:50:52] isaiah's prophecies and he brought it
[1:50:55] over into mary's day
[1:50:58] and he said mary
[1:51:00] isaiah said virgin i say mary
[1:51:04] mary isaiah said emmanuel counselor
[1:51:08] mighty god i say jesus
[1:51:11] what did he do he took the word that had
[1:51:14] already been spoken
[1:51:15] and he made it more positive and he made
[1:51:17] it more real and that's what we're doing
[1:51:19] hey man what did we know about
[1:51:21] predestination nothing but the prophet
[1:51:23] came and he picked up by his ephesians
[1:51:26] he picked up ephesians he picked up
[1:51:28] romans 8 and he said him those who have
[1:51:30] foreign
[1:51:32] he's already justified
[1:51:34] already glorified
[1:51:36] what can we say against god's elect if
[1:51:39] god is for who can be against them he
[1:51:42] picked up what had already been written
[1:51:44] and he brought it into our day what is
[1:51:46] he doing making it more positive
[1:51:48] what did he do he knew there were going
[1:51:50] to be believers that was going to
[1:51:52] believe it
[1:51:54] oh my god i never forgot about abram
[1:51:56] thank you lord for reminding me him it
[1:51:58] was abraham and sarah he didn't know how
[1:52:00] it was going to happen

[1:52:09] abraham also laughed
[1:52:13] but they don't talk about abraham's
[1:52:15] laughing
[1:52:17] sarah laughed in hebrews nothing about
[1:52:20] sarah's laughing
[1:52:21] do you think you're going to get to
[1:52:23] heaven and god's going to call you one
[1:52:25] side and say all right
[1:52:26] um on a scale of one to ten how many

[1:52:32] section so write you in heaven but
[1:52:34] you'll be in the loser section in heaven
[1:52:36] and then you will be in the okay you
[1:52:38] never made that many mistakes you'll be
[1:52:39] in the victor's victory section and then
[1:52:42] brother branham he was a prophet he'll
[1:52:43] be in the
[1:52:44] in the vip section thank you sister amen
[1:52:50] you think god's got segregation

[1:53:03] without us
[1:53:06] you read the book of hebrews 11 and you
[1:53:09] say lord i wish i can be like this and
[1:53:11] god goes through hebrews 11 and he gets
[1:53:12] to the losses
[1:53:14] they without ferdi
[1:53:18] they without us
[1:53:21] cannot be made perfect
[1:53:23] then he goes all along he says now you
[1:53:24] gonna bring up the resurrection
[1:53:26] you know what we are gonna meet jesus in
[1:53:29] the air
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:34] he is not gonna put his foot on the
[1:53:36] earth
[1:53:38] everybody says jesus is coming jesus is
[1:53:40] coming
[1:53:40] do you know how he's coming
[1:53:42] in you
[1:53:44] do you know the only jesus this world is
[1:53:46] going to see
[1:53:48] is this person called a man from south
[1:53:51] africa
[1:54:02] thessalonians says and together we're
[1:54:05] going to meet him in the sky
[1:54:07] do you know there's going to be a
[1:54:09] meeting in the air

[1:54:13] when the earth is purified
[1:54:15] but he's not putting his foot on the
[1:54:16] earth and i like how everybody says oh
[1:54:18] jesus is coming jesus is coming and the
[1:54:20] world don't realize it's coming in you
[1:54:22] yeah
[1:54:23] and the world doesn't realize you are
[1:54:24] the coming of the lord
[1:54:28] i think that's a bit of a shocker there
[1:54:32] you mean jesus that got caught up in a
[1:54:35] cloud and they told their disciple don't
[1:54:37] worry the way you see him go he's coming
[1:54:39] back
[1:54:40] so you mean in 63
[1:54:43] he was starting his descent
[1:54:47] because they said the way he went is how
[1:54:49] he's coming
[1:54:51] and everybody looked for jesus and there
[1:54:53] was jesus the carpenter's son
[1:54:55] and today everybody's looking for jesus
[1:54:58] and they don't realize
[1:55:00] there's jesus
[1:55:02] brothers
[1:55:04] he deals with artificial intelligence
[1:55:06] there's jesus that loves hunting there's
[1:55:09] jesus that does whatever you do you the

[1:55:29] jesus on two feet
[1:55:31] jesus saying what a mighty god is that
[1:55:34] jesus
[1:55:36] and when you become a manifestation of
[1:55:39] the word
[1:55:41] your life is going to be such a power
[1:55:44] it shakes the graves
[1:55:47] [Applause]
[1:55:48] i don't know whether you realize that
[1:55:50] believers i'm so off my message but it
[1:55:52] doesn't matter amen i don't know whether
[1:55:54] you realize that when you come to

[2:08:55] making the trials and the fire hotter
[2:08:59] and his brother got so enthused and he
[2:09:00] said lord turn up the heat was it like
[2:09:02] yet something like that turn up the heat
[2:09:06] and god took him at his word
[2:09:09] and god turned up that heat that week
[2:09:12] and gave him hell
[2:09:13] and he came back and he said he's never
[2:09:15] going to do that again
[2:09:17] i don't ask for that it will happen in
[2:09:19] its time

[2:18:04] whatever and i want to encourage you
[2:18:06] young people i would encourage you
[2:18:08] believers whatever you can do to promote
[2:18:12] not the church promote the kingdom of
[2:18:14] god

[2:18:24] that man i wish i could
[2:18:26] whatever we can do for god's kingdom
[2:18:29] because the devil has the young people i
[2:18:31] look at these young brothers men i'm
[2:18:33] thinking young brothers mean god can use
[2:18:35] you for the kingdom
[2:18:37] devil has these young guys
[2:18:39] the devil has the
[2:18:41] almost said michael jackson's he's dead
[2:18:43] right the
[2:18:44] justin bieber and i don't know all the
[2:18:46] other guys the devil has these guys
[2:18:49] god is looking for young men
[2:18:51] and young sisters
[2:18:54] that can shape the kingdom of god
[2:18:57] that's what god's looking for
[2:18:59] because young people relate to young
[2:19:01] people
[2:19:03] i mean i'm my age and i still help out
[2:19:04] with the young people men the young
[2:19:06] people i can't relate to to 12 14 15

[2:19:10] about me what can i teach them about
[2:19:12] those social media and things like that
[2:19:14] right

[2:20:16] devil can't say i've got all the young
[2:20:18] people he can't because he doesn't have
[2:20:20] all the young people he doesn't have all
[2:20:22] the mommies he doesn't have all the
[2:20:25] daddies he doesn't have all the girls he
