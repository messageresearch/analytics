[47:58] back at the end of this day and say it
[48:00] was you Lord Jesus so Grant It For Your
[48:02] Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[48:05] amen God bless you friends you can have
[48:07] your seats uh this morning I was um so
[48:10] it was before camp and I was thinking
[48:12] about jealousy for some reason I begin
[48:14] to think about why uh you know why
[48:16] people get jealous you know there's a
[48:18] reason for everything and you know just
[48:19] the thought came to me that because
[48:21] jealousy is you know it can be you know
[48:23] it can be it can be because of many
[48:26] things right people can be jealous over
[48:29] over people who who who have money they
[48:31] don't it makes them jealous or different
[48:33] things but really what came to me was
[48:35] jealousy because of inadequacy where
[48:38] people be feel inadequate to do
[48:40] something and they get jealous of those
[48:42] who are made to do it amen and um so
[48:45] this this here in Proverbs 14 and3 we're
[48:48] just going to let's just let the Lord
[48:49] just have his way you know preached on
[48:51] meekness and and you know unselfishness
[48:53] I just think we just continuing in those
[48:54] kind of thoughts
[48:56] you know cuz God's got to prepare us to
[48:57] leave this earth you know it's God's got
[48:59] to do surgery in our lives and break
[49:01] generational problems and carnal natures
[49:03] and you know God doesn't want those
[49:05] things in us so you know this is where
[49:07] we are you know you know so so this this
[49:10] word here if we look at this Envy it's
[49:12] another word we can put in there is is
[49:13] it's say jealousy or Envy now we know
[49:16] our God is a jealous God but there's a
[49:18] negative there's a perverted jealousy
[49:21] and that's the one that we want to we
[49:22] want to get rid of today amen it's not
[49:24] meant to be our portion so you know it's
[49:27] you know that so the Envy is rottenness
[49:29] of the bones that's how terrible
[49:31] jealousy jealousy destroys people
[49:34] jealousy destroys communities jealousy
[49:36] destroys Nations you know even um we'll
[49:39] get into it maybe later but you know
[49:41] especially you know um you know like in
[49:43] for example Pap Guinea you know there's
[49:45] people are very jealous there you know
[49:47] there'll be people I know people who
[49:48] have who you know you in their own
[49:50] village they you know you they have a
[49:51] village meeting they say look I want to
[49:53] I want to make a pig farm pigs are very
[49:55] valuable over there they mean a lot
[49:56] they're they're very valuable commodity
[49:58] they said look I'm going to make a pig
[50:00] farm in our village you know you you
[50:03] know all of us are going to work
[50:04] together and we're going to even share
[50:05] the profits this is going to benefit us
[50:07] all they make the pig farm but because
[50:10] they even their own relations are so
[50:12] jealous of them doing something greater
[50:14] than themselves they will kill all the
[50:16] pigs they'll burn down the farm because
[50:17] they're jealous they'd rather destroy
[50:19] the place then see their neighbor and
[50:22] their family Prosper wow you say well
[50:25] that's over over there no it's here too
[50:26] it just comes in different forms but
[50:27] that's jealousy see jealousy would
[50:30] rather see the place in ashes than than
[50:33] that than see anyone go forward but it's
[50:35] amazing because your jealousy jealous
[50:38] people like to help though they like to
[50:41] be the ambulance at the bottom of the
[50:42] cliff so they hate to see people succeed
[50:45] but when they're broken on the bottom
[50:47] then they want to help so people say I'm
[50:49] not jealous because I want to help
[50:50] people who are ruined but they want to
[50:52] push them off the cliff so jealousy is
[50:54] very subtle in it in its ways we don't
[50:57] want to be the ambulance at the bottom
[50:58] we want to be the fence at the top amen
[51:01] because because someone who's not
[51:02] jealous wants to see someone Prosper you
[51:04] know I was thinking if you guys all
[51:06] became multi-billionaires I'd be happy
[51:08] for you I wouldn't be jealous I'd be
[51:10] glad amen use it for the kingdom of God
[51:12] you know I'm not worried about that
[51:14] stuff doesn't bother me people do well
[51:16] praise the Lord you know God moves go
[51:18] you know you have a family Revival
[51:20] praise God you know we shouldn't be
[51:22] jealous of anything amen God does for
[51:24] anyone
[51:25] yes on natural or spiritual right but we
[51:28] know jealousy came from Satan it's not
[51:30] an attribute of God and so we don't want
[51:33] any part of him amen even it says in
[51:35] Romans 13 He says the night is fast
[51:37] spent the day is at hand let us
[51:39] therefore cast off the works of darkness
[51:41] and let us put on the armor of light let
[51:43] us walk honestly as in the day not in
[51:46] rioting and drunkenness not in
[51:48] chambering and wantedness you say well I
[51:50] don't do any of those things not in
[51:51] strife and envying Hallelujah so not in
[51:54] strife and trouble and turmoil and we
[51:56] got to have someone to fight against and
[51:57] something you're battling with and you
[51:59] know some people love to have an
[52:01] opposition but they but they but they
[52:03] turn the gun on their brother and sister
[52:06] they think their cause is against
[52:07] someone else no we have a cause against
[52:08] the devil right the Bible says we should
[52:11] live peaceably with all men if the
[52:13] waters aren't troubled then there's no
[52:14] trouble don't stir the waters don't
[52:17] cause trouble for trouble's sake you
[52:19] know some people live off drama no we
[52:20] should live off the word of God and the
[52:22] peace of God that passes all
[52:24] understanding amen so he says let us
[52:26] walk honestly let you know we we don't
[52:29] walk in the nighttime people who walk in
[52:32] darkness have are full of strife and
[52:34] envying now that doesn't mean there's
[52:36] not you know Strife when I'm talking
[52:38] about Strife here I'm not talking about
[52:39] trouble in your life you know through
[52:42] Great Tribulation we enter the kingdom
[52:43] of God right we have trouble we're not
[52:45] void of trouble just because you become
[52:47] a Believer we actually get more trouble
[52:49] but we have the one who deals with the
[52:51] trouble on the inside of us and he takes
[52:53] care of it he proves his word in that
[52:55] trouble and then what does he do just
[52:57] just to reveal himself give you
[52:59] testimony after testimony of his Saving
[53:01] Grace then you have greater confidence
[53:02] in the god that's called you amen so
[53:04] sure we'll have trouble but this Strife
[53:06] is there's no peace in the soulelujah
[53:08] there's always a trouble there's always
[53:09] a contention and there's always an envy
[53:12] and a jealousy but let's not walk like
[53:14] this this is not your walk okay our walk
[53:16] is peace love joy and the Holy Ghost
[53:19] amen this is how this is this is what
[53:21] we're called to I'm just going to go
[53:23] through this and hey we're going to get
[53:24] to an end and I pray God would just
[53:26] touch me too amen amen so Strife is a
[53:29] quarrel a contention a debate a a a
[53:31] Strife a variance we shouldn't be full
[53:34] of that full of
[53:35] quarreling we shouldn't have any
[53:37] quarrels true amen hey I'm just going to
[53:40] go amen we shouldn't have any quarrels
[53:43] amen blessed are the peacemakers amen
[53:45] blessed are the pure in heart amen you
[53:48] know those Beatitudes that Jesus spoke
[53:50] amen he's describing the character of a
[53:52] Believer amen so he's actually see he he
[53:56] spoke it am mean the Holy Ghost should
[53:57] take that word take it into your life
[53:59] and manifest it out of your life amen so
[54:01] that so we should be a walking
[54:04] Beatitudes amen this is how we should be
[54:07] amen amen see now what does it mean to
[54:09] be jealous un s Cambridge told me this
[54:13] unhappy and slightly angry because you
[54:15] wish you had someone else's qualities
[54:16] advantages or success they should just
[54:19] be happy amen amen Lord we should rally
[54:23] yes God's moving we should rally around
[54:25] that move I mean just be thankful you
[54:26] know like brother bam said on the Ohio
[54:28] River he was just he was just there when
[54:30] God turned up you know and I want to be
[54:32] wherever God turns up Hallelujah that
[54:35] that's where I want to be wherever he is
[54:37] Lord where are you going I'm coming with
[54:38] you Lord you you that's how we should be
[54:40] amen we shouldn't be unhappy or jealous
[54:43] because someone because God is moving in
[54:46] someone else's life you know because the
[54:48] reason we people get jealous as they
[54:49] think well they're not doing it my way
[54:51] therefore it's wrong their family is
[54:54] different to my family
[54:55] and God can't bless that family cuz
[54:57] they're not like my family every family
[54:59] is Sovereign every family is different
[55:02] all of our children are different as
[55:04] husbands and wives we're different God
[55:07] is not a cookie cutter amen where do we
[55:10] we are the only thing we're to conform
[55:11] to is the word amen right not to our
[55:15] idea of how we should all be amen but
[55:18] you see if we see jealousy Compares it's
[55:21] always comparing it's always keeping
[55:23] stock of people and it's no forget that
[55:27] we should compare ourselves with the
[55:28] word of God amen amen so but you see and
[55:32] to be inadequate means lacking the
[55:33] quality or quantity required
[55:35] insufficient for a purpose now when I'm
[55:37] talking about these things I'm talking
[55:38] more spiritually here because you know
[55:41] people get jealous we'll take it through
[55:43] the scripture when God moves God always
[55:46] when God comes he causes trouble yeah
[55:49] cuz he's about to stir up and change the
[55:51] status quo over Place amen you can see
[55:53] this when when um you know when Samuel
[55:56] is told by God to go to Jesse's house to
[55:58] anoint one of his sons king and the
[56:01] first thing that Jesse's family Jessy
[56:03] says have you come peaceably because
[56:05] they know wherever Samuel goes God goes
[56:07] and God sent him and God's going to
[56:09] cause some trouble because God's going
[56:11] to stir up the status quo and that's
[56:13] what the anointing does Amen CU jealousy
[56:15] wants to keep everything the same but
[56:16] God wants to build amen powerhouses of
[56:19] the Holy Ghost in every one of our Lives
[56:21] amen he wants to stir us up he wants to
[56:24] bulldo the devil's Kingdom and build his
[56:26] kingdom and whenever that comes there's
[56:28] a upheaval of things amen there's always
[56:30] a disturbance that's why when even
[56:32] people are convicted there's a
[56:34] disturbance going on Amen they feel
[56:36] convicted they try and blame but the
[56:37] devil say blame this person this person
[56:39] this person no you got to fully die out
[56:41] and let God change your nature am mean
[56:44] so that's why Samuel was asked you know
[56:46] they trembled the Elders of the Town
[56:47] trembled it is coming this is the last
[56:49] verse and they said comest thou
[56:51] peaceably she's like man something's
[56:53] going to happen he Samuel doesn't just
[56:55] go somewhere because he wants to go
[56:56] somewhere God has sent him to do
[56:58] something amen and he says yes peaceably
[57:01] I'm come to sacrifice unto the Lord
[57:04] sanctify yourselves and come with me to
[57:06] the sacrifice now this is going to spark
[57:08] some jealousy wherever God because many
[57:11] times we think of you know God chose me
[57:14] Hallelujah I'm the bride praise God
[57:16] you're just happy you're in but what
[57:18] about those who say that's not fair who
[57:21] said they should be in why not me see
[57:24] there's always a flip to every coin see
[57:27] people who really know him Rejoice that
[57:29] they know him others who don't know him
[57:30] are jealous that they don't know him
[57:32] like that but they'll always carnally
[57:34] belittle someone they'll always carnally
[57:37] belittle the believer that's
[57:38] jealousy so Samuel is going to come and
[57:41] he's going to anoint David as king
[57:44] because David is ordained to be King
[57:46] David was made to be king the anointing
[57:48] remember did not make him King the
[57:50] anointing Came Upon him because he was
[57:52] King he had kingship in his life amen
[57:54] that was is he was predestinated to
[57:56] become king over Israel so now if you
[57:59] imagine now when you know David is you I
[58:01] mean Jesse calls his sons but he doesn't
[58:04] call his youngest son the one that God
[58:07] ordained to be king is not even invited
[58:09] to the feast and you know no doubt you
[58:11] know Jesse would go to his older Sons
[58:13] and he would say look look Samuel's
[58:15] coming he wants to have a feast with us
[58:17] they would do their hair they would get
[58:18] dressed out would get already you know
[58:20] cuz they're expecting that that you know
[58:21] that Samuel's going to do something you
[58:23] know God's going to touch their lives
[58:24] and some way so they get dressed for
[58:26] church they're already you know they do
[58:28] what they do and you know they put on
[58:30] their choice clothes and everything and
[58:32] then now one by one they're instructed
[58:34] to pass before the prophet so no doubt
[58:37] when it's your turn let's just put
[58:38] ourselves in their shoes right nowall
[58:40] I've been told I'm basically go going
[58:43] before the prophet of God God's going to
[58:44] speak to me God's going to do something
[58:47] but then every time it's just like nope
[58:49] how would you feel when you hear a
[58:51] no let's be real let's be real friends
[58:55] how would you feel you're expecting
[58:56] especially the eldest elab it's going to
[58:59] be me look I look like a king I you know
[59:02] I'm built like a king I'm the eldest so
[59:04] I'm the leader of the home the elders
[59:06] isn't always a leader some people think
[59:08] they're leaders they're not leaders some
[59:09] people think they're not leaders but
[59:10] they meant to be leaders amen so you got
[59:12] to be very you know this is not an age
[59:14] thing that dictates who's who right I
[59:17] mean you one by one they go past and
[59:18] everyone no no because God tells because
[59:21] even Samuel thought that eliab was going
[59:23] to be it but you know God would tell him
[59:26] don't look on the outside it's not a
[59:29] statue of a man I'm not talking about a
[59:30] physical ability that makes us
[59:32] inadequate in a person it's a spiritual
[59:35] inadequacy amen that is the thing that
[59:37] causes a jealousy and so here they go
[59:40] one by one and you know you know Samuel
[59:42] thinks the first one yes cuz he's big
[59:44] he's strong he looks like a king but God
[59:46] says no I'm not looking at those things
[59:48] I don't look as humans do but I look at
[59:51] the heart of man amen God seeth the
[59:53] heart he doesn't look on the outward
[59:54] appearance then Jesse called abinadab
[59:57] and made him to pass by before Samu he
[59:58] said neither ha the Lord chosen this
[1:00:00] then Jesse called shamama to pass by he
[1:00:02] said neither hath the Lord chosen this
[1:00:04] and one by one they all go past and then
[1:00:07] Samuel left stand there there's a whole
[1:00:09] bunch of nose but then finally there's
[1:00:11] you know Samuel says do you have another
[1:00:12] son and J is like oh yeah I do go get
[1:00:16] him he's in the field you know so so
[1:00:18] David comes in
[1:00:21] now here comes the youngest brother now
[1:00:24] I don't know if you can see the emotion
[1:00:25] I wanted this photo cuz you see the
[1:00:26] emotion on the picture here to me I mean
[1:00:29] I mean you know the drawing to me this
[1:00:30] encapsulates it because here's all the
[1:00:33] NOS who are here who think they're yeses
[1:00:36] and here comes the yes who is really
[1:00:38] they thought was a no he wasn't even
[1:00:40] invited and then now look at this
[1:00:42] imagine this this is your family one of
[1:00:45] your siblings is going to be king yeah
[1:00:47] it's not you but it's going to be one of
[1:00:49] them shouldn't you be instead of this
[1:00:52] you should be hallelujah amen amen amen
[1:00:54] my brother's going to be king he's going
[1:00:56] to be anointed king we're going to take
[1:00:58] the whole land amen God's going to live
[1:01:00] in our house amen that's my brother
[1:01:03] Hallelujah I'm his brother amen Hall I'm
[1:01:05] his big brother Hallelujah that should
[1:01:08] be see see that is not jealousy amen
[1:01:10] that is that is a genuine Thanksgiving
[1:01:12] to God that God would visit the home
[1:01:15] amen anoint one of us hallelujah to do a
[1:01:17] predestinated job but they don't look
[1:01:20] like that do they they're
[1:01:23] jealous are unhappy this guy this little
[1:01:27] boy this young fella you know wow I
[1:01:31] think God's got it wrong oh come on now
[1:01:33] Samuel you're too old you know you're
[1:01:34] causing no no no this is not right you
[1:01:37] know but no God said no but he said yes
[1:01:40] to this one but you see it caused a
[1:01:43] jealousy to rise up can you imagine the
[1:01:46] next day or after Samuel leaves W
[1:01:48] imagine the dining
[1:01:50] table you know normally the youngest in
[1:01:52] the family you kind of look after them
[1:01:54] they're like the family petting away you
[1:01:55] know cuz they're the baby of the family
[1:01:57] not after
[1:01:59] this here comes David in they were all
[1:02:02] there when it happened the Bible says
[1:02:05] the spirit of God was with them from
[1:02:06] that day on do you not think there was a
[1:02:08] at a presence came down when Samuel was
[1:02:11] pouring the anointing oil on David's
[1:02:13] head there would have been a different
[1:02:14] atmosphere walking with
[1:02:15] him but then imagine the dinner table it
[1:02:19] wasn't just now tell us again how it
[1:02:20] felt oh how's it now when you play your
[1:02:23] H David it now when when you're with
[1:02:25] your sheep man that's amazing as you'd
[1:02:27] say man I just play and it's different
[1:02:28] when I play now you know it's like I'm
[1:02:31] not playing anymore it's like my hands
[1:02:33] just you know there's an unseen Force
[1:02:34] guiding my hands and I begin to sing
[1:02:36] lyrics I've never heard about before and
[1:02:38] there's such an atmosphere come oh play
[1:02:40] for us David and he begins to play
[1:02:42] around the dining table then God comes
[1:02:44] down Hallelujah it wasn't like that why
[1:02:47] because of
[1:02:48] jealousy it would have been you know
[1:02:50] instead of looking after the little
[1:02:52] brother he would have been become more
[1:02:53] of a pain
[1:02:55] and he didn't do anything different it
[1:02:56] was just now the older brother's
[1:02:58] attitude because of jealousy against the
[1:03:00] younger one they would have been
[1:03:02] offended look I've been in the message
[1:03:03] longer I know all the quotes and all the
[1:03:05] scriptures and all these things it
[1:03:06] should be me but God doesn't look at
[1:03:08] those things he looks at the heart he
[1:03:10] has predestinated vessels that will
[1:03:12] manifest his promised word in its season
[1:03:15] and you know I believe look I'll read
[1:03:18] the quote at the end I'll just say it
[1:03:19] not for B but you know brother Bram says
[1:03:21] I may not be able to manifest all the
[1:03:23] word but I'm not going to stand in the
[1:03:25] way of people who
[1:03:26] can amen so here's this picture
[1:03:31] now and then we know that there's a
[1:03:33] there's the call to
[1:03:35] war and when Saul and all the so so now
[1:03:38] this is this is now with Goliath coming
[1:03:40] out and bringing his boast and
[1:03:43] challenges so when Saul and all the is
[1:03:45] and all Israel heard those words of the
[1:03:48] Philistine they are dismayed and greatly
[1:03:50] afraid now David was the son of that
[1:03:53] ephran night of Bethlehem Judah whose
[1:03:55] name was Jesse he had eight sons and the
[1:03:57] man went among men for an old man in the
[1:04:00] days of Saul and the three eldest sons
[1:04:02] of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
[1:04:04] battle and the names of his three sons
[1:04:06] that went to the battle were eliab the
[1:04:08] firstborn who was rejected remember the
[1:04:11] next under him was abinadab and the
[1:04:13] third was shama and David was the
[1:04:15] youngest and the three eldest followed
[1:04:18] Saul see you see now there's a big
[1:04:20] difference between the three eldest and
[1:04:22] David because they went into Saul's army
[1:04:25] they got trained like Saul they got
[1:04:27] ecclesiastical vest like Saul trying to
[1:04:30] manufacture a promise amen but David was
[1:04:33] schooled by God Amen with the sheep in
[1:04:36] everyday life God was training David
[1:04:38] Amen in a different training that the
[1:04:41] three Elders got and now remember
[1:04:43] there's jealousy in the family right
[1:04:46] there's jealousy in the family amen
[1:04:49] because the eldest was
[1:04:51] inadequate but if he realized is
[1:04:54] inadequacy and he rallied around those
[1:04:57] who was adequate it would have been a
[1:04:58] totally different picture because
[1:05:00] jealousy can
[1:05:01] simmer it can be a lot of passive
[1:05:04] aggressive comments for a long time but
[1:05:06] then it'll boil over eventually what's
[1:05:09] in the inside comes out amen I trust you
[1:05:11] just enjoy it with me amen I've been
[1:05:13] enjoying this amen because there's so
[1:05:15] many things in the word of God you look
[1:05:17] at Family Dynamics and it's Spirits am
[1:05:20] mean it's more than just carnal well
[1:05:21] dynamics of a family there's Spirits
[1:05:23] within family am amen it's either God or
[1:05:26] it's a family spirit amen and we're
[1:05:28] called to cast out the family Spirit
[1:05:30] we're not called to live by a family
[1:05:31] strain but the family strain of the
[1:05:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's
[1:05:36] what we're called to have amen so now
[1:05:38] David it says now David left his
[1:05:40] Carriage now notice this now am me the
[1:05:42] first verse here I've got in yellow see
[1:05:44] they were all they were dismayed and
[1:05:46] greatly afraid this was the whole Army
[1:05:49] now if you think about this if if
[1:05:52] David's three older brothers really
[1:05:54] rallied around what God did in David's
[1:05:56] life when they first heard Goliath's
[1:05:59] challenge maybe a few days in they could
[1:06:01] have sat around the campfire and said
[1:06:03] you know
[1:06:04] Brothers our younger brother killed a
[1:06:07] lion and a bear remember when he was
[1:06:10] anointed remember when Samuel came to
[1:06:12] our house remember when God anointed him
[1:06:14] remember when the presence of God came
[1:06:16] into his life and then he would you know
[1:06:18] because remember when David you know
[1:06:20] David killed The Lion and the bear who
[1:06:22] would have been the first people who
[1:06:23] would have heard about it
[1:06:24] the older brothers amen the family would
[1:06:26] have heard about it who would have seen
[1:06:28] maybe the lion rug outside David's tent
[1:06:31] they would have seen it amen and the
[1:06:32] bear the next they would have seen it
[1:06:34] amen so they would have been it wasn't
[1:06:36] secondhand yeah they heard it firsthand
[1:06:39] the testimony of God's power in his life
[1:06:41] am mean so really if they had no
[1:06:43] jealousy they could have said you know
[1:06:44] what our brother's got a different
[1:06:46] atmosphere with him he's not he there's
[1:06:49] a fearlessness about this boy did you
[1:06:52] see that lion he killed he said he
[1:06:54] grabbed it by the Scruff of the neck and
[1:06:56] he slid its throat it after he hit it
[1:06:57] hit it with a stone and I looked at its
[1:06:59] body there was really a knife mark his
[1:07:02] throat was really cut Hallelujah did you
[1:07:05] see that Berry down I've never seen such
[1:07:07] a big thing a big Whopper as that thing
[1:07:09] you know there's something different
[1:07:10] about our brother and God's been proving
[1:07:13] it we should bring him to the battle
[1:07:15] Glory look we're all let's be honest
[1:07:17] here we're all dismayed we're greatly
[1:07:19] afraid of this guy but David has
[1:07:22] different kind of testimonies amen David
[1:07:24] has a different kind of a training let's
[1:07:25] go get him see if they did that that
[1:07:27] would have been a proof there was no
[1:07:29] jealousy in their lives CU they just
[1:07:30] wanted to get the job done amen who
[1:07:33] cares who calls the last one in let's
[1:07:34] just get them in who cares I I don't
[1:07:37] care if it's us or not I'm not worried I
[1:07:39] just want to go home amen amen so you
[1:07:41] know that's how we should be right amen
[1:07:43] amen amen it's not about trying to B see
[1:07:46] now see David left his Carriage into the
[1:07:48] hand of The Keeper of the carriage ran
[1:07:49] to the Army and came and saluted his
[1:07:51] Brethren as he talked with them behold
[1:07:52] they came up the ch Champion the the
[1:07:55] Philistine of gath Goliath by name out
[1:07:57] of the armies of the Philistines and
[1:07:59] spake it quing the same words and David
[1:08:01] heard them and all the men of Israel
[1:08:02] when they saw him fled from him and were
[1:08:04] sore afraid all those men included his
[1:08:07] brothers right so jealousy wants to keep
[1:08:10] everything in status quo this is what
[1:08:12] jealousy wants to do amen so so if they
[1:08:15] weren't jealous it wouldn't have
[1:08:17] remained this
[1:08:18] way but then now when David heard the
[1:08:21] boast of Goliath
[1:08:24] and he began to speak to the men who
[1:08:26] stood by him saying what will be done to
[1:08:28] this man that kills this Philistine and
[1:08:30] taketh away their approach from Israel
[1:08:32] for who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:08:35] that he should defy the armies of the
[1:08:37] Living God and the people answered him
[1:08:39] after this man is saying it so shall it
[1:08:41] be done to the man that kth him and iLab
[1:08:43] his eldest brother see now the eldest
[1:08:45] Brothers had enough the passive
[1:08:47] aggressiveness of the past and all these
[1:08:49] it's going to erupt all
[1:08:52] right it's going to erupt because when
[1:08:54] he heard David talk like this his anger
[1:08:57] was kindled against David and he said
[1:08:59] why comest thou down hither amen and and
[1:09:02] with whom hast thou left thy few sheep
[1:09:04] those few sheep in the wilderness
[1:09:06] basically what you've been doing has
[1:09:08] been no credit to the family you've been
[1:09:10] doing nothing that's been help he's got
[1:09:12] a few sheep in the wilderness you have
[1:09:13] no real responsibility you you don't
[1:09:15] know what it's like to be like me and
[1:09:18] David didn't cuz he had god with him he
[1:09:19] didn't have a spirit of jealousy oh amen
[1:09:22] but you see he's trying to belittle
[1:09:23] David he says I Know Thy pride and the
[1:09:25] naughtiness of thine heart for thou art
[1:09:28] come down that thou might see the battle
[1:09:30] and David said what have I now done so
[1:09:34] basically iLab what is it now you've
[1:09:36] been picking at me and blooding me since
[1:09:39] I've been anointed by God and you know
[1:09:42] what have I done now what is it now this
[1:09:45] is what jealousy jealousy wants to keep
[1:09:47] undermining under roading pulling down
[1:09:50] squishing down you know this is what
[1:09:52] jeal the spirit of jealousy does that's
[1:09:54] why he says what have I now done what is
[1:09:55] it now elab blah blah blah jealousy
[1:09:58] jealousy jealousy you just want see
[1:10:00] they're all afraid elab is afraid but
[1:10:03] jealousy will make a person who has the
[1:10:06] goods will try and pull that person down
[1:10:08] to be like everyone else so basically
[1:10:10] elab saying to David just be like us
[1:10:12] tremble and
[1:10:15] run there has to be an end of a
[1:10:19] stalemate there has to be an end of just
[1:10:22] a status quo we're not called to status
[1:10:24] quo of living with the devil hey Israel
[1:10:27] is dismantling Hamas I pray they well
[1:10:30] they're fighting Spirits they won't be
[1:10:32] able to do it but if that's the bride in
[1:10:35] the natural What About Us in the
[1:10:37] spiritual amen are we are we are we just
[1:10:41] willing up with fencing the devil off in
[1:10:43] our lives some when he fires Rockets
[1:10:45] every so often are we just sick of it
[1:10:47] and I'm going to dismantle this thing
[1:10:49] amen I'm going to dismantle everything
[1:10:51] that's not of God in my life I'm going
[1:10:52] to let the Holy Spirit
[1:10:54] amen burn it out I'm going to let him
[1:10:56] come in take out the tunnels take out
[1:10:58] the Deep rooted things take out the
[1:11:00] surface things take out the in between
[1:11:02] things I'm going to let God take it
[1:11:03] eradicate It Whatever the cost it's
[1:11:06] going amen if I've got to confess things
[1:11:08] I've got to confess things if I've got
[1:11:10] to look foolish I've got to look I've
[1:11:11] got to Bear the approach for the word
[1:11:13] I'm going to Bear the approach if I got
[1:11:15] to be identified with this word and
[1:11:16] everyone forsakes me so be it sir I want
[1:11:19] this I want this demon out of my I want
[1:11:21] this trouble I want this H my spirit
[1:11:23] want this thing out of my life amen but
[1:11:26] you see pride will allow it to remain
[1:11:29] that's why David said what have I now
[1:11:31] done see this is what this wasn't the
[1:11:34] first time eliab just erupted Adam the
[1:11:36] older brother tried to tried to crush
[1:11:38] the one who actually had the anointing
[1:11:40] but you see when you've got the
[1:11:41] anointing you know that your identity is
[1:11:43] not in your family anymore though they
[1:11:45] are your family and you love them and
[1:11:47] appreciate them you know you're a Son of
[1:11:48] God or a daughter of God you know you
[1:11:50] come from God you're going back to God
[1:11:52] and you know that your father is God
[1:11:53] your identity is in him it's not in your
[1:11:55] last name amen it's in your real name as
[1:11:59] the Bride of Jesus Christ when you
[1:12:01] really get the anointing you know that's
[1:12:03] true amen because why he comes to
[1:12:05] Quicken seed he comes to Quicken his
[1:12:08] children amen it's not a haphazard thing
[1:12:10] you receive the Holy Ghost you're
[1:12:11] predestinated to receive it amen the
[1:12:13] Bible says in Galatians because you are
[1:12:15] Sons he sends forth your his Spirit
[1:12:17] where you cry ABA father my father my
[1:12:19] father you don't become Sons by the new
[1:12:21] birth you get born again because you are
[1:12:23] the Lord hallelujah amen so David David
[1:12:26] could withstand the
[1:12:29] criticism amen David could with
[1:12:31] understand this jealousy Spirit it
[1:12:33] didn't let him Rob him of his Joy it
[1:12:36] tries to jealousy wants to destroy any
[1:12:38] kind of Joy any kind of love anything
[1:12:41] that's good jealousy wants to just just
[1:12:43] level the whole thing but you see now
[1:12:46] jealousy is so crippling it tries to
[1:12:49] the real believer but it but it
[1:12:52] cripples the one who's got that spirit
[1:12:54] because a testimony doesn't mean
[1:12:56] anything to them anymore I me because as
[1:12:58] I said earlier that you
[1:13:00] know they would have been the first ones
[1:13:02] that would have heard the account of
[1:13:04] David killing the lion in The Bear they
[1:13:06] would have seen the Skins they would
[1:13:07] have seen the you know the marks in the
[1:13:10] carcass where he slid its throat and all
[1:13:11] those things they would have seen all
[1:13:13] those things amen but you see that those
[1:13:16] testimonies did not impact them because
[1:13:18] they were jealous they did not rejoice
[1:13:21] because of what God God delivered a lion
[1:13:24] and a beer into the hands of David they
[1:13:26] probably would have been happier if
[1:13:27] David was
[1:13:29] dead that's what jealousy does they're
[1:13:32] only sad when someone's basically dead
[1:13:35] that's jealousy because you see now when
[1:13:38] David went into Saul he began to share
[1:13:41] those same testimonies that his brothers
[1:13:43] saw see Saul wasn't there when he killed
[1:13:45] the lion and the bear Saul didn't see
[1:13:46] the you know uh bear skins and the lion
[1:13:49] skins and the you know all the he didn't
[1:13:51] see any of the evidence he just heard
[1:13:53] that testimony but the brothers saw the
[1:13:55] evidence and heard the testimony but
[1:13:57] because of jealousy it didn't impact
[1:13:59] them at all that's right because it
[1:14:01] didn't cause him to say hey God
[1:14:02] delivered those animals into his into
[1:14:04] his hand let's go get him and he's going
[1:14:06] to kill this Goliath see David see David
[1:14:10] you know when you know when his brother
[1:14:11] said you just got Pride you're arrogant
[1:14:13] you're naughty in your heart you're
[1:14:14] Wicked all these things why have you
[1:14:15] come see David was serving his father
[1:14:18] that's why he uh ended up there cuz his
[1:14:20] father Jessy said take this food to your
[1:14:22] brothers so he was serving in his family
[1:14:24] doing what the father told him he I can
[1:14:26] say he was serving the word he was
[1:14:28] living according to the word how the
[1:14:30] word wanted him to be but that jealous
[1:14:32] spirit will not see someone walking in
[1:14:34] the word amen it will condemn whatever
[1:14:36] they do if it's contrary to what they're
[1:14:38] doing amen so you know but you see so
[1:14:42] you know you're just naughty David said
[1:14:44] no my you our father said bring this
[1:14:46] food to you here it is I'm doing what
[1:14:48] I'm told now what's this guy doing oh no
[1:14:52] you know but but you see so this
[1:14:55] testimony that Saul heard caused Saul to
[1:14:58] have confidence in David that David
[1:14:59] could kill Goliath but you see those
[1:15:02] same testimonies didn't mean anything to
[1:15:04] eliab and his older brothers did not
[1:15:05] mean anything because of jealousy it
[1:15:07] nullified the testimony in their old
[1:15:09] life in their own lives instead of
[1:15:11] getting the benefit that's why I say if
[1:15:12] they rallied around and praised God that
[1:15:14] God anointed one of their brothers as
[1:15:16] king man they would have been blessed
[1:15:19] they would have been so blessed amen
[1:15:21] they' be so blessed to see God use
[1:15:23] brother way that God did did not ordain
[1:15:25] for them to be used remember they are
[1:15:27] still Israelites they are circumcised to
[1:15:29] the Covenant they were Believers but
[1:15:31] because jealousy came in it nullified
[1:15:33] the effects of what God is about to do
[1:15:34] in their
[1:15:37] Nation
[1:15:39] amen so Saul heard these
[1:15:42] testimonies and it stirred him up to say
[1:15:45] David you may be a young
[1:15:47] person God uses young people amen amen
[1:15:50] God uses young people all the way
[1:15:52] through the scripture
[1:15:53] and God still uses young people let no
[1:15:56] one that's what Timothy was told by Paul
[1:15:58] let no man despise thy youth he told
[1:16:00] Timothy that he didn't tell the elders
[1:16:01] that he told Timothy that CU Timothy was
[1:16:04] going to be withstood by Elders that
[1:16:05] were jealous of the gift in Timothy's
[1:16:07] life and how God was using him amen
[1:16:09] those were jealous people oh you say but
[1:16:11] they're Believers yeah Believers can be
[1:16:12] jealous if they're not born again they
[1:16:14] can be jealous amen that's right and if
[1:16:17] we allow those spirits to come in we can
[1:16:19] become jealous but if we let that if we
[1:16:21] let God take that out of us yeah
[1:16:23] God is not jealous in that way that's
[1:16:25] right amen amen and if God's life is in
[1:16:28] us we cannot be jealous in that way it's
[1:16:30] impossible cuz what it's his life within
[1:16:32] us amen so now there he was he you know
[1:16:36] David David was you know David testified
[1:16:39] to King Saul and King Saul said go the
[1:16:41] Lord be with thee so it impacted King
[1:16:44] Saul praise God it impacted him and
[1:16:48] because of that testimony David was
[1:16:50] selected to go kill Goliath we know he
[1:16:52] is predestinated to to do the job he
[1:16:54] knew exactly what to do you see the
[1:16:56] anointing is
[1:16:57] misunderstood the anointing is very
[1:16:59] misunderstood brother Braham said this
[1:17:01] and why are people so tossed about I
[1:17:02] thought this is so amazing how this came
[1:17:04] out this sermon see the greatest
[1:17:06] anointing that was ever given to anyone
[1:17:08] was Jesus Christ we have the spirit by
[1:17:10] measure he had it without measure and
[1:17:12] one day he entered into the temple and
[1:17:14] picked up the scroll and said the spirit
[1:17:16] of God is upon me fearth anointed me to
[1:17:18] preach the acceptable ye to bind up the
[1:17:20] broken hearts to heal the sick to give
[1:17:21] sight to the blind now we would think if
[1:17:24] such an anointing was on him had been
[1:17:26] prophesied 800 years before that it
[1:17:28] would come and here he was with that
[1:17:30] type of anointing the full blessing and
[1:17:32] anointing of the Lord upon him we would
[1:17:34] want to run all over the building scream
[1:17:36] and holler
[1:17:38] yeah but the Bible said he laid down the
[1:17:40] scroll sat down and precious words
[1:17:42] proceeded out of from his mouth that's
[1:17:45] what he done under the anointing the
[1:17:46] anointing is not emotion the anointing
[1:17:49] is supreme power in control knowing
[1:17:51] exactly what and how
[1:17:53] see that is the anointing to have
[1:17:55] supreme power un under control or in
[1:17:58] control knowing exactly what and how
[1:18:01] I'll say that having the supreme power
[1:18:02] in control is not you controlling the
[1:18:04] anointing but the anointing controlling
[1:18:07] you I mean because the sons of God are
[1:18:08] led by the spirit of God so it's not us
[1:18:10] that controls the Holy Ghost if you get
[1:18:12] in your mind God I want to control your
[1:18:15] spirit you are wrong you're a luciferian
[1:18:17] I mean but if you let God live I mean
[1:18:19] like I think I said it up in Oakland
[1:18:21] many times people say I've got to the
[1:18:23] Holy Ghost and that's true but really
[1:18:24] what you should say is the Holy Ghost
[1:18:26] needs to get me am me because we are are
[1:18:29] prisoners to him he is not a prisoner to
[1:18:31] us amen so sure that's a good thing to
[1:18:33] say I've got to get the Holy Ghost it
[1:18:35] should be Lord get me Here I Am Here I
[1:18:37] Am Lord I lay it all down I Surrender my
[1:18:39] life completely that you can come and
[1:18:40] live in my life that's what we need to
[1:18:42] have amen so it's knowing exactly what
[1:18:44] and how and it's not it's not saying I
[1:18:47] think I know it's you know it comes by
[1:18:49] Revelation it's not guesswork this is
[1:18:51] not a guesswork Christianity amen the
[1:18:54] sons of God are live by the spirit of
[1:18:55] God me my sheep know my voice as
[1:18:57] stranger they'll not follow I know them
[1:18:59] by name amen there's a personal
[1:19:00] relationship between you and God am mean
[1:19:03] you know his voice you know his
[1:19:04] leadership it can be different to all of
[1:19:05] us right like brother B he's Leed by
[1:19:07] Vision I I don't think I've ever had a
[1:19:09] vision in my life I've had dreams he
[1:19:11] spoken to me audibly by voice he's
[1:19:14] quickened his word to my heart I mean I
[1:19:15] met you know I've seen dreams that have
[1:19:17] come to pass those I I've seen those
[1:19:19] things right I've seen those things but
[1:19:22] I haven't had a vision like brother R
[1:19:23] would describe that doesn't mean that I
[1:19:25] have to have visions to be led by God
[1:19:28] true cuz however God speaks to you is
[1:19:31] how he speaks to you and God Made You
[1:19:33] unique right but you'll see the proof of
[1:19:35] the pudding is the eating thereof so in
[1:19:37] other words if he speaks to you he'll
[1:19:39] bring it to pass and you don't need to
[1:19:40] make it come to pass he'll bring it to
[1:19:43] pass amen the Lord so so we got to have
[1:19:47] confidence in his voice see knowing
[1:19:48] exactly what and
[1:19:50] how amen but you see now now what
[1:19:54] happens is people uh jump to another
[1:19:57] side and say well what about emotion
[1:19:59] emotion follows emotion is not the main
[1:20:02] thing emotion follows right Revelation
[1:20:06] brings stimulation you get the
[1:20:08] Revelation then it stimulates you right
[1:20:10] so when God quickens the word to a heart
[1:20:12] it brings stimulation it brings a
[1:20:15] response of a joy and a Hallelujah and a
[1:20:16] praise God and you may scream and holler
[1:20:18] and run around the building that's
[1:20:20] perfectly fine but do it because of
[1:20:22] Revelation yeah right don't do it just
[1:20:24] because there's a great atmosphere y y I
[1:20:27] know many of us and people don't know
[1:20:29] how to handle the presence of God
[1:20:30] because it's too great and it should be
[1:20:32] too great cuz our God is God you know
[1:20:34] Hallelujah but you see emotion should
[1:20:36] follow see the anointing is not emotion
[1:20:39] but it will bring emotion amen and you
[1:20:41] know if you just read the message any
[1:20:43] bit you'll see how brother Brown
[1:20:44] balances all these things he says other
[1:20:46] saying you know I know she was healed I
[1:20:48] know he was healed then why can't I be
[1:20:50] healed certainly you can brother only
[1:20:51] thing is get the anointing of the Holy
[1:20:53] Spirit what is it brother Bram take God
[1:20:56] at his word see he's telling you how to
[1:20:57] get the anointing take God at his word
[1:20:59] for by faith are you saved that through
[1:21:01] Grace and not by works not mental
[1:21:03] emotions no stir up no speaking with
[1:21:06] tongue no shouting no nothing by faith
[1:21:08] walk into the presence of God say Lord
[1:21:10] God I come solemnly on the basis of your
[1:21:13] word and I believe you that's how you go
[1:21:17] by faith walk into his presence say I
[1:21:19] believe you according to your word amen
[1:21:22] amen you say brother Braham don't you
[1:21:23] believe in shouting speaking tongues yes
[1:21:25] sir but you're putting the cart before
[1:21:27] the horse amen come to Christ first come
[1:21:30] to Christ first let the Holy Spirit just
[1:21:32] take you over start eating from the
[1:21:34] manner it's good today it's good
[1:21:35] tomorrow it's good all the time every
[1:21:37] day amen so don't don't don't just tie
[1:21:41] emotion with the anointing because we
[1:21:43] can just feel emotional we are emotional
[1:21:45] people we share we should have a healthy
[1:21:48] emotional realm right we're not robots
[1:21:51] we don't shut down and be all t and
[1:21:53] tough and whatever no we should feel
[1:21:54] emotions but the emotions come after was
[1:21:57] like John when he saw the lamb come
[1:21:58] forward he saw the revelation of the
[1:22:00] Lamb coming forth then everything in
[1:22:02] Heaven and Earth and under the Earth
[1:22:03] heard him cry out glory and blessing and
[1:22:05] honor and power be to the lamb why
[1:22:07] because he saw the meteor to step forth
[1:22:09] the one who he actually saw on the earth
[1:22:11] had now stepped forth to claim the book
[1:22:13] amen so he saw that as a revelation and
[1:22:16] it made him made the stimulation he made
[1:22:18] his cup run over hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:20] so that's how it should be amen
[1:22:23] nothing wrong with getting emotional
[1:22:24] don't shut down and be all stok and dead
[1:22:26] we're not dead people we're not
[1:22:27] tombstones we're living stones me filled
[1:22:30] with the Holy Ghost amen so but you see
[1:22:32] and don't get all tense about it just
[1:22:34] enjoy God Amen see cuz I I can see
[1:22:36] people's minds already analyzing well am
[1:22:39] I too emotional and am I emotional
[1:22:41] before and you know how does this work
[1:22:42] and how should I feel right now just
[1:22:44] enjoy God Amen just relax and let God
[1:22:47] minister to us Amen Let God flow let God
[1:22:49] live Amen Let God be God Amen and and
[1:22:52] God will take care of all those things
[1:22:53] just love
[1:22:54] him
[1:22:56] amen amen but you see we are not we are
[1:22:59] not bound by impression amen Impressions
[1:23:03] will lead us anyway all right amen
[1:23:06] sometimes we find that someone spoke in
[1:23:08] tongues the other one wants to imitate
[1:23:09] him they'll speak in tongues too one
[1:23:11] sees one give interpretation the other
[1:23:13] says I've got it too and you go by
[1:23:15] Impressions then say thus sayith the
[1:23:17] lord well that's wrong and God will
[1:23:18] never move you any further what you are
[1:23:21] right now just an organiz ation until
[1:23:23] you get out of that you can be a oneman
[1:23:26] organization a mean being led by
[1:23:28] impression trying to imitate amen what
[1:23:31] God is doing in someone genuine you've
[1:23:32] got to get out of that mode you see Saul
[1:23:35] trained David's older brothers they
[1:23:38] would have tried to be imitators right
[1:23:40] but God trained David in the
[1:23:43] wilderness amen so they had to get away
[1:23:45] from that ecclesiastical training to
[1:23:47] walk with God amen amen so you say but
[1:23:50] be sure where are we now you might not
[1:23:53] like me now but at the day of judgment
[1:23:55] you'll love me see be sure don't say it
[1:23:57] unless God says so and you know that it
[1:23:59] is the truth that God said so not your
[1:24:02] opinion not uh but not some impression
[1:24:05] because you can be impressed any way so
[1:24:08] we can't go well I feel the Lord
[1:24:11] said
[1:24:12] no he either says it or not right and if
[1:24:16] he says it it happens amen and we should
[1:24:18] be man or woman enough to say I was
[1:24:21] wrong amen
[1:24:23] God loves honesty right because we can
[1:24:25] be Leed by like for example you know you
[1:24:27] know we were we were we downstairs when
[1:24:30] Gabriel was dedicated with downstairs a
[1:24:32] I had such a strong feeling my family's
[1:24:37] complete you can be impressed anyway I
[1:24:41] the first two Analise and Lilia though
[1:24:42] dedicated and I thought no no there's
[1:24:44] more to come and then Here Comes Here
[1:24:46] Comes Gabriella the family's done we are
[1:24:50] done no
[1:24:53] I was
[1:24:54] wrong praise God I was
[1:24:57] wrong but we can't be so fixated on I
[1:25:00] feel your feelings will do this all
[1:25:02] around and that's what the charismatic
[1:25:04] Pentecostal church is I feel this and I
[1:25:06] feel that this could be this in Prophecy
[1:25:08] and all these things we've had a
[1:25:09] Vindicated Prophet coming this day he's
[1:25:11] given us thus sayith the Lord we know
[1:25:13] where we are the message shows us where
[1:25:14] we are in time amen we're waiting for
[1:25:16] the coming of the Lord the bride is
[1:25:17] making yourself ready amen here we are
[1:25:20] remember the only way to stand for
[1:25:21] Israel is get into your position as the
[1:25:23] bride and go on the Rapture that is the
[1:25:24] only way sympathy Facebook posts
[1:25:27] anything else will not help them we must
[1:25:29] get out of the way cuz when we leave
[1:25:31] amen the two prophets come and Grace is
[1:25:33] restored back to them and God will fight
[1:25:35] for his people amen that's how it has to
[1:25:37] be amen so you want to stand for this
[1:25:39] world get in the word surrender to the
[1:25:42] Holy Ghost and let him control you and
[1:25:44] let him form you into the image of the
[1:25:45] word that's the only way to help this
[1:25:47] world you care about the environment get
[1:25:49] into the word become one with the Lord
[1:25:51] Jesus Christ you care about this world
[1:25:53] do that amen that's the one thing we
[1:25:55] must do believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:57] thine and thy house shall be saved amen
[1:25:59] that is absolutely essential amen see
[1:26:01] for as many are as led by the spirit of
[1:26:05] God they are the sons of God does not
[1:26:07] say as many are led by Impressions amen
[1:26:09] no they're led by the spirit of God Amen
[1:26:11] my sheep know my voice amen so we're not
[1:26:14] led by impression we're led by thus
[1:26:16] sayith the Lord amen and you should have
[1:26:18] confidence when God tells you something
[1:26:20] it's amen amen that's
[1:26:23] praise the Lord you know because it
[1:26:24] comes to
[1:26:26] pass
[1:26:28] amen praise the Lord just like years ago
[1:26:31] when I finally got the Revelation that I
[1:26:33] was going to marry Christine about at
[1:26:34] least a year after the Lord told her I
[1:26:37] said praise God I'm going to get married
[1:26:39] I knew it was going to happen I didn't
[1:26:42] have to guess I was reading Proverbs who
[1:26:44] whosoever findeth a wife find a good
[1:26:45] thing that obtained favor of the Lord
[1:26:47] and the Lord spoke to me and said that's
[1:26:49] Christine I didn't have to now make it
[1:26:51] happen
[1:26:52] even though of course you know you do
[1:26:54] everything right but you know I didn't
[1:26:55] have to like go there and move there and
[1:26:58] you no you rest in God's timing you rest
[1:27:01] in God's leadership right just like the
[1:27:03] Lord said the first prayer meeting we
[1:27:04] ever had if you remain humble my word
[1:27:06] will continue to go forth and I'll bring
[1:27:08] people here and they'll find rest and we
[1:27:10] and we've seen that come to
[1:27:13] pass I know you're beneficiaries of that
[1:27:15] amen it did not say and they would
[1:27:17] become just message people no they would
[1:27:19] enter into rest they' receive the
[1:27:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost they would
[1:27:23] really know him Hallelujah now that
[1:27:25] doesn't mean we had to go to the streets
[1:27:26] and compel and do all these things no
[1:27:28] God brought everyone sovereignly in
[1:27:30] different ways over different times
[1:27:33] amen hallelujah but you see now jealousy
[1:27:36] jealousy doesn't have
[1:27:38] confidence in the leadership of God
[1:27:41] jealousy only has confidence in keeping
[1:27:43] the status quo wow and you see we cannot
[1:27:47] we cannot trust in
[1:27:49] Impressions because it says here in
[1:27:51] James but let him ask in faith nothing
[1:27:54] wavering for he that wavereth is like a
[1:27:55] sea uh a wave of the sea driven with the
[1:27:59] wind and tossed let not that man think
[1:28:02] that he shall receive anything of the
[1:28:04] Lord so another shall as in might no a
[1:28:07] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[1:28:09] ways so if you think it it might happen
[1:28:13] you become unstable the Lord could do it
[1:28:17] no amen hallelujah do you believe it
[1:28:21] it's not a fear it might not happen we
[1:28:23] got to get all that out of us see the
[1:28:24] devil the devil always puts a question
[1:28:26] mark on God's word right are you all
[1:28:28] following me today I know you're kind of
[1:28:30] thinking about these things and you know
[1:28:32] if I look you in the eye I'm not making
[1:28:33] a point at you I'm just looking you in
[1:28:34] the eye okay so don't take it personally
[1:28:36] right but you see we can't be unstable
[1:28:39] if God said it that settles it like
[1:28:41] brother Burley said if God said it that
[1:28:43] settles it right so if God has given us
[1:28:46] a promise that settles it how when I
[1:28:48] don't know but he'll do it yes if he
[1:28:51] quickens it to you you amen amen never
[1:28:54] ever approach god with a maybe you can
[1:28:56] Lord no it's yay and the promises of God
[1:28:59] a yay and amen amen because if you begin
[1:29:01] to doubt the word and the devil loves to
[1:29:03] try and put doubt upon the word you
[1:29:04] become double-minded
[1:29:06] unstable in all of your ways we don't
[1:29:09] want to be unstable amen we want to walk
[1:29:12] with God now but you see now Saul
[1:29:14] himself had a jealous spirit and he had
[1:29:18] a complex of the family he came out of
[1:29:20] yeah but you see see and you and and
[1:29:23] Samuel answered Saul and said I am a I
[1:29:26] am the SE God before me un the high
[1:29:27] place for ye shall eat with me today and
[1:29:30] tomorrow I'll let thee go and tell thee
[1:29:31] all that is in thine heart and as for
[1:29:33] thine asses that thou lost three days
[1:29:35] ago set not thy mind on them for they
[1:29:37] are found and on whom is all the desire
[1:29:39] of Israel is it not on thee and on all
[1:29:42] thy father's house remember God told
[1:29:44] Samuel to anoint Saul King right and
[1:29:47] Saul answered and said am I not a
[1:29:48] benjamite of the smallest of the tribes
[1:29:51] of Israel and my family the least of all
[1:29:53] the families of The Tribe of Benjamin
[1:29:55] wherefore then speaketh thou so to me
[1:29:58] see he came out of the smallest tribe
[1:30:01] the smallest family out of the smallest
[1:30:03] tribe but his job was to unite all the
[1:30:05] 12 tribes under one headship God will
[1:30:08] use those who come out of unlikely
[1:30:11] backgrounds but I came out of a broken
[1:30:13] home I never knew my father I never knew
[1:30:15] my mother I never knew I never had
[1:30:16] siblings I never had a stable home life
[1:30:18] you this is basically what Saul's saying
[1:30:20] he's trying to bring a he he's trying to
[1:30:22] bring forth his insecurities and
[1:30:25] insecurities bring forth jealousy it's a
[1:30:27] beating ground for jealousy to bloom
[1:30:30] amen but do you see God called uh Saul
[1:30:33] to be
[1:30:34] king and if he just stuck with that
[1:30:37] commission where he came from would not
[1:30:39] have mattered why because God wasn't
[1:30:42] calling him to stay in that to be known
[1:30:45] by that he was to be known as King Saul
[1:30:48] just like you and I we're not to be
[1:30:49] known by where we came from our
[1:30:51] background our upbringing whatever
[1:30:53] trouble has happened I'm not diminishing
[1:30:55] those things not one bit but those
[1:30:57] things should never identify us they
[1:30:59] should not be our our name amen we are
[1:31:02] not Mr or Mrs broken home trouble past
[1:31:05] pull it a post whatever more we're not
[1:31:07] those people amen no we are the redeemed
[1:31:09] Sons and Daughters of God washed in the
[1:31:11] blood of the Lamb amen we are M Jesus
[1:31:14] Christ he has called us by a high and
[1:31:15] holy calling am me to stand by his
[1:31:18] sideen but you see Saul because of this
[1:31:20] insecurity am mean it bred it bred a
[1:31:24] complex it bred a jealousy in his life
[1:31:26] but look at this now his father was a
[1:31:29] mighty man of power his man his father
[1:31:32] was a mighty man he came out of actually
[1:31:34] Incredible family if you think about
[1:31:36] this is this is this is the family that
[1:31:38] God would allow him to be born into to
[1:31:41] to train him to be a
[1:31:43] king amen his father wasn't a weakling
[1:31:46] he wasn't a boy he was a mighty
[1:31:48] man of power amen and he had a son now
[1:31:51] now even look at Saul see he was a
[1:31:53] choice young man and goodly and there
[1:31:55] was not among the children of Israel a
[1:31:57] goodlier person than he for his
[1:31:59] shoulders and upward he is higher than
[1:32:01] any of the people so he so he he looked
[1:32:03] like a king you say well but but he was
[1:32:06] never ordained to be king because he
[1:32:08] came out of the wrong tribe now if Saul
[1:32:10] didn't have any jealousy about
[1:32:12] him when when when Samuel told him that
[1:32:15] the kingdom was going to be taken from
[1:32:16] him if he had no jealousy he'd be like
[1:32:18] okay who's the next king let me let me
[1:32:21] prepare for him to stand on this you
[1:32:23] know let me let me lay a platform for
[1:32:25] this next king I mean that it's not a
[1:32:27] big amount of trouble that when he steps
[1:32:28] on the throne but be such a smooth
[1:32:31] transition y y he could say to Jonathan
[1:32:33] Jonathan I've ruined my testimony I have
[1:32:37] I I've gone against the word of God and
[1:32:38] God's rejected me but Jonathan someone
[1:32:41] else is going to become king I don't
[1:32:42] know who but when that person is called
[1:32:44] you stand by that man and Jonathan we're
[1:32:46] going to prepare this Kingdom that when
[1:32:48] that man comes to the position it's
[1:32:50] going to be a seamless transition
[1:32:52] because remember David wasn't a jealous
[1:32:54] man and when God told David that he he
[1:32:56] wasn't going to build the temple he
[1:32:58] didn't throw his toys he didn't have a
[1:33:00] hissy foot he began to prepare and bring
[1:33:03] material and bring everything that when
[1:33:05] Solomon came to the throne he could
[1:33:07] start building the Temple he didn't sit
[1:33:10] there and say I'm not sharing the
[1:33:11] because you know David got the plans eh
[1:33:13] yes he had the plans God showed him how
[1:33:16] to build it he didn't you when God said
[1:33:18] you're not building this he didn't he
[1:33:19] didn't he had no jealousy in him because
[1:33:21] he didn't say well no I'm not sharing
[1:33:23] this with
[1:33:24] anyone you ordered this wood from here
[1:33:26] forget it send it back break these
[1:33:28] Stones up you know empty the coffers you
[1:33:30] know we're going to spend no no he
[1:33:31] didn't do that but jealousy will burn
[1:33:34] everything around it yeah right but he
[1:33:36] wasn't a jealous believer CU he was a
[1:33:38] man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah
[1:33:41] Lord amen but you see so so that's how
[1:33:45] we should be amen now I know time's
[1:33:47] running away but I'm just going to run
[1:33:48] with it so now as we said
[1:33:52] now jealousy came from
[1:33:55] Satan and when the first worship came
[1:33:58] worship spiritual worship produces
[1:34:01] jealousy we may not like to admit it but
[1:34:03] it produces jealousy testimonies produce
[1:34:07] jealousy amen not for the believer but
[1:34:09] for the unbeliever the make believer so
[1:34:11] now here we are we have Cain and Abel
[1:34:14] they have you know comes to the process
[1:34:16] of time when they realize you know that
[1:34:18] they're Fallen they live in a fallen
[1:34:19] state that Jehovah God made all things
[1:34:21] and they want to approach God they want
[1:34:23] to worship God they want to have
[1:34:24] communion with God that's why you build
[1:34:26] a family altar I mean that's why they
[1:34:27] built their altars because they wanted
[1:34:29] to have communion with God and now so
[1:34:31] here's able he brings his lamb you know
[1:34:33] Cain's already brought his fruit and
[1:34:34] whatever he brought you know and you
[1:34:36] know and then and and then they're
[1:34:39] worshiping and then God comes down and
[1:34:41] receives Abel's sacrifice now if Cain
[1:34:45] was actually the son of Adam he would
[1:34:47] have rallied around Abel's sacrifice
[1:34:49] wouldn't that been amazing they have
[1:34:52] you know it's like you're having a
[1:34:53] prayer meeting at home and then one of
[1:34:54] your family breaks through into the
[1:34:56] anointing amen and' be like hallelujah
[1:34:58] praise God you know you'd be so happy
[1:35:00] you know if one of my girls were all
[1:35:02] praying and they break through and start
[1:35:03] shouting and the anointing comes down
[1:35:04] and they start and and you know it's not
[1:35:06] them praying it's God praying through
[1:35:08] them you know if you're a jealous parent
[1:35:10] God forbid that I'm looking at anyone on
[1:35:12] this camera or here that's like that if
[1:35:14] you're jealous you'd say no no they're
[1:35:15] too young they don't deserve that that's
[1:35:16] not right they do these things oh wow
[1:35:19] that's jealousy that's Cain yes right
[1:35:21] but you know if he was the son of Adam
[1:35:23] he would have been ring around Abel you
[1:35:25] broke through God came down accepted
[1:35:27] your sacrifice the god that our parents
[1:35:30] told us about has come down into our
[1:35:32] church we're not having just a dead
[1:35:33] formal worship anymore but now the
[1:35:35] anointing of Jehovah has come down
[1:35:37] hallelujah how can I gather and rally
[1:35:39] around what you're doing how can I help
[1:35:41] out how can I become part of the move of
[1:35:43] God hallelujah but you see Cain got
[1:35:47] mad didn't make him happy it just made
[1:35:49] him angry it made made him angry now
[1:35:52] remember Cain it says here by faith Abel
[1:35:55] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:35:56] sacrifice than Cain so Cain's sacrifice
[1:35:59] wasn't a haphazard thing it wasn't just
[1:36:01] a casual he was sincere he believed in
[1:36:04] God he was not an atheist he wasn't an
[1:36:06] idol worshipper he really believed in
[1:36:08] God he really believed in God but you
[1:36:11] see so so Abel so he had an excellent
[1:36:13] sacrifice but Abel's was more excellent
[1:36:16] because Abels was by Revelation I mean
[1:36:18] it wasn't by human ability and and and
[1:36:21] and just a you know a feel lad kind of
[1:36:24] you know presuming kind of a thing no he
[1:36:26] had Revelation it was blood and it was a
[1:36:29] lamb amen so now but you see it caused
[1:36:33] jealousy to rise up and Cain so you now
[1:36:36] notice it's always the natural to hate
[1:36:37] the spiritual it causes Cain to hate
[1:36:39] Abel it caused cor to hate Moses it
[1:36:41] caused Judas to hate Jesus and on and on
[1:36:43] it goes It goes the natural to hate the
[1:36:45] spiritual just as Cain at the beginning
[1:36:47] hated Abel the one that God received the
[1:36:49] Sacrifice from and tried to destroy the
[1:36:51] them even they try to destroy the
[1:36:53] influence they try to destroy everything
[1:36:54] because it's nothing but jealousy it
[1:36:56] started in Cain it proved it with
[1:36:58] jealousy and it's still the same thing
[1:36:59] today I mean when the natural the carnal
[1:37:01] and the spiritual meet together it
[1:37:03] proves it Satan nother way because
[1:37:05] jealousy comes from Satan and then it
[1:37:07] causes an impersonation of the truth
[1:37:09] somebody to try and do to impersonate
[1:37:12] something that it isn't they're not
[1:37:13] ordained to do how much of it have we
[1:37:15] seen in the last days oh how much of
[1:37:19] it amen you see now but by by God
[1:37:22] vindicating Abel by coming down
[1:37:24] receiving a sacrifice that caused
[1:37:25] jealousy with Cain because he was
[1:37:27] jealous of his brother and he slew his
[1:37:30] brother that's what jealousy will do you
[1:37:31] say well I haven't stuck a knife in
[1:37:33] anyone but have you killed their
[1:37:34] influence have you murdered their
[1:37:36] influence to someone else that's history
[1:37:39] is repeating itself
[1:37:42] amen amen but you see Saul going back to
[1:37:45] Saul so that was just in Cain and Abel
[1:37:48] Cain was jealous because God did not
[1:37:50] accept his sacrif but then even God came
[1:37:52] down and spoke to Cain just do like your
[1:37:53] brother did you know there's no record
[1:37:56] of God ever speaking to Abel in the
[1:37:58] Bible but he has a conversation with
[1:37:59] Cain that's how much actually God cared
[1:38:01] about Cain so listen forget the fruit
[1:38:05] Cain get a lamb did you see God did you
[1:38:08] see me vindicate look I know what I'm
[1:38:10] talking about because I'm The Vindicator
[1:38:11] of the word if I can put words in God's
[1:38:13] mouth I'm The Vindicator of the word I
[1:38:15] put that Revelation in Abel and then
[1:38:17] Abel manifested that Revelation and then
[1:38:19] I Vindicated that revelation Yeah by by
[1:38:22] receiving the sacrifice so K I didn't
[1:38:25] even need to give you the Revelation you
[1:38:26] saw it work just go do what your brother
[1:38:28] did you'll be accepted by me it's it's
[1:38:29] you know it's easy but you see even
[1:38:33] jealousy jealousy overrode God's
[1:38:37] intervention God help us where we get to
[1:38:40] a point if we ever get to a point we
[1:38:42] become jealous of
[1:38:44] anyone that God can't actually guide us
[1:38:47] anymore and it's our carnal nature Rises
[1:38:50] up and just kills the spirit
[1:38:52] God help us am we never want to get to
[1:38:54] that point or even near that point you
[1:38:56] feel jealousy or resentment against
[1:38:58] anyone you get to your knees and pray
[1:38:59] amen right then and there you feel any
[1:39:01] order against anyone CU they do well or
[1:39:03] whatever happens don't don't hold on to
[1:39:06] it amen that's one thing like a lot of
[1:39:08] things my wife tells me goes in one ear
[1:39:10] out the other right it should be the
[1:39:12] same thing with that kind of thing
[1:39:13] should go in and out yes am have no
[1:39:16] beding ground in the middle yes but you
[1:39:19] see now Saul Saul was jealous he failed
[1:39:22] to Rally around the gift that came into
[1:39:24] his kingdom because remember when David
[1:39:26] when they returned from the slaughter of
[1:39:28] the Philistines see the women came out
[1:39:29] of all the city singing and dancing to
[1:39:31] meet King Saul with tabrets with joy
[1:39:33] with instruments of music and the woman
[1:39:35] answered one another as they played
[1:39:37] saying Saul has slain his thousands and
[1:39:39] David his 10, thousands and see it
[1:39:42] didn't make Saul happy wouldn't that
[1:39:44] make you happy we got a champion in our
[1:39:46] mid hallelujah hallelujah we got God's
[1:39:49] champion no it's it's not him Saul
[1:39:52] wasn't happy he it it made him very
[1:39:54] wroth and the same displeased him and
[1:39:57] see and he said they have ascribed unto
[1:40:00] David 10, thousands to me they've
[1:40:01] ascribed but thousands but and what can
[1:40:03] he but have but more um and sorry what
[1:40:07] can he have but more but the kingdom and
[1:40:09] Saul I David from that day and
[1:40:12] forward so it's Once Upon a Time David's
[1:40:15] testimony moved David uh moved Saul but
[1:40:18] now because of jealousy even that
[1:40:20] doesn't matter anymore
[1:40:21] yes you see jealousy is often rooted in
[1:40:24] insecurities and fears that a person may
[1:40:26] not even realize they have these could
[1:40:29] uh include a fear of oversimplification
[1:40:32] fears of inadequacy fears of Abandonment
[1:40:34] fears of being replaced and fear of
[1:40:36] being judged just like Saul we're not
[1:40:39] Sauls I don't
[1:40:40] believe
[1:40:42] amen praise the Lord I feel like I'm
[1:40:45] getting my point across amen but you see
[1:40:48] this is what always happens this is what
[1:40:49] jealousy will do because of because of
[1:40:51] an insecurity within the individual they
[1:40:53] can become jealous there's nothing wrong
[1:40:55] with what God's doing it's within them
[1:40:58] and they hold on but that insecurity
[1:41:00] becomes their identity see if Saul just
[1:41:03] moved with the plan of God the
[1:41:05] insecurity would have left because he
[1:41:07] would have realized hey someone else is
[1:41:09] going to become king praise God we're
[1:41:10] going to have a transition we're going
[1:41:12] to do things that aren't normally done
[1:41:13] in kingdoms amen but because of jealousy
[1:41:15] he held on to it to The Bitter End and
[1:41:17] he died of
[1:41:18] failure amen we don't want to be like
[1:41:20] that
[1:41:21] Hallelujah yeah even says of Jesus that
[1:41:24] pilate knew that for Envy they delivered
[1:41:26] him to be crucified so because of
[1:41:28] jealousy they had the Messiah crucified
[1:41:31] see because why when Jesus came he upset
[1:41:34] all the tradition he upset human Church
[1:41:37] order hey God has a church order humans
[1:41:39] have church order right that's why I
[1:41:41] said he upset all the human Church order
[1:41:44] amen he did things that the scribes and
[1:41:46] Pharisees didn't even want to do they
[1:41:48] didn't want to deliver the people they
[1:41:49] didn't want to you know know set people
[1:41:51] free from all the bondage they actually
[1:41:53] laid them on with rules and regulations
[1:41:55] had nothing to do with the word of God
[1:41:57] Amen and they did but even they said we
[1:41:59] know you're a teacher come from God but
[1:42:01] the more Jesus did the more angry they
[1:42:03] became the more blinded they became amen
[1:42:06] it's amazing that after after um Lazarus
[1:42:08] was raised from the dead then they would
[1:42:10] have the meeting that they would you
[1:42:12] know what are we going to do about him
[1:42:14] this man does so many miracles and then
[1:42:16] caias you know and all they worried
[1:42:18] about was their was their standing we
[1:42:20] know if he you know if we let him alone
[1:42:21] all men will believe on him and the
[1:42:23] Romans shall come and take away both our
[1:42:25] place and Nation how do they know that
[1:42:28] but jealousy see jealousy wants to keep
[1:42:30] its position and that jeal and that
[1:42:33] position is actually nine times out of
[1:42:35] 10 of
[1:42:36] fantasy really when Saul was rejected
[1:42:38] King he was no longer King so he was
[1:42:40] living in a fantasy world that I'm King
[1:42:42] he wasn't king no more I mean the
[1:42:44] scribes and Pharisees they worried about
[1:42:45] their position being taken their
[1:42:47] position wasn't even God's position
[1:42:49] anymore cuz they had moved from the the
[1:42:50] word of God true tradition amen so
[1:42:53] they're all worried about a and and
[1:42:55] that's how people can be in church we
[1:42:56] can have a wrong idea of our position in
[1:42:58] the church we're just coming on home
[1:43:01] amen but you see we can't live in a
[1:43:02] fantasy world see gifts always gifts
[1:43:05] make room for themselves amen but you
[1:43:08] see now caias said you know one man must
[1:43:09] die foration so I'm just kind of
[1:43:11] speeding up a bit and it says now after
[1:43:14] they after they after caias has
[1:43:17] prophesied these things amen it says
[1:43:20] then from that day forward they took
[1:43:22] counsel together to put him to death he
[1:43:24] had raised Lazarus from the grave he
[1:43:26] didn't just say I'm resurrection and
[1:43:28] life he proved it a man four days in the
[1:43:29] grave never been done before amen praise
[1:43:32] God you would have man could you
[1:43:35] imagine a man who looks like any other
[1:43:37] man just walks into the
[1:43:39] building and then by the end of that
[1:43:41] service every trouble we have sickness
[1:43:44] spiritual what it's
[1:43:46] gone and then we have lunch and we begin
[1:43:49] to pull apart that guy and say how
[1:43:52] terrible he is and how offended we are
[1:43:54] that he came and did that that's what
[1:43:56] the Jews did with Jesus he came into the
[1:43:58] synagogues own's crippled or whatever on
[1:43:59] the Sabbath day heals them they get mad
[1:44:02] the been sitting in church for
[1:44:04] years I don't know how long and they
[1:44:05] just that jealousy will keep that person
[1:44:08] there that's how bad jealousy is cuz
[1:44:10] they're jealous of what Jesus would do
[1:44:12] and then when Jesus came in and actually
[1:44:13] set that free they weren't
[1:44:15] rejoicing saying thank you Rabbi we were
[1:44:18] praying for
[1:44:19] him we we knew God would come one day
[1:44:22] we'd heal them we're so happy for this
[1:44:24] this is the greatest moment of the
[1:44:26] synagogue is that you the Messiah would
[1:44:28] come in our midst and you'd heal this
[1:44:30] man You' set this one free of this evil
[1:44:32] spirit Lord you would do these things
[1:44:34] we've been praying and longing for it to
[1:44:35] happen would one day see the day and now
[1:44:38] we see the day they weren't like
[1:44:40] that they got mad yeah but we're in the
[1:44:44] message we're not exempt from these
[1:44:45] things we're still people religious
[1:44:47] Spirits are not a respector of Doctrine
[1:44:49] or belief amen they took counsel
[1:44:51] together to put him to death amen you
[1:44:54] see
[1:44:55] now we don't want to ever come to a
[1:44:58] place that jealousy destroys our
[1:45:01] Christian
[1:45:03] walk amen where where someone else
[1:45:05] begins to receive the word we don't get
[1:45:07] offended at it see jealousy gets
[1:45:10] offended when someone else tries to come
[1:45:11] in and they want to meet God cuz because
[1:45:15] jealousy wants to keep everything the
[1:45:17] same and if that person doesn't match
[1:45:19] what we think we are they're out we're
[1:45:21] all growing hallelujah amen some of us
[1:45:24] are growing out some of us are growing
[1:45:25] up but we're all growing Lord
[1:45:27] spiritually we're all growing I just put
[1:45:28] a joke in there cuz I feel a bit of you
[1:45:30] know let's just calm down a bit you know
[1:45:32] we're all growing the person you were a
[1:45:34] week ago you're not that person today
[1:45:37] the person you were a year ago you're
[1:45:38] not that person today give our kids a
[1:45:41] chance let them make mistakes as brother
[1:45:43] Arman said let them but let's guide them
[1:45:45] when they do but jealousy wants to keep
[1:45:47] them on the floor and tell them why
[1:45:49] they're wrong and that they're wrong and
[1:45:50] I'll stay
[1:45:51] wrong let's not be that way let's see
[1:45:55] all the Lord wants to do when we Fallen
[1:45:56] Sinners pick us up dust us off and walk
[1:45:58] us on that's all he cares about are you
[1:46:01] okay Lord I've done this it's all right
[1:46:04] you've repented my blood covers it your
[1:46:06] just keep walking I'm so discouraged
[1:46:09] Lord but just keep you can do it how
[1:46:11] many times see like William pling Lego
[1:46:13] he's trying to put the things together
[1:46:14] he gets all upset I said no just do it

[1:46:43] all
[1:46:45] amen but you see when the Jews they
[1:46:47] rejoicing when Paul was opening the
[1:46:49] scriptures to them but when the G genes
