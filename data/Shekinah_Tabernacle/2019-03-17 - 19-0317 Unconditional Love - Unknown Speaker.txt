with ourselves to you Jesus name Amen thank you okay well you're standing it's um bring up my fight feels like a nice intimate service this morning it's nice actually I kind of like it when there's just a few people you can kind of just talk to the people look at each one in deal individually I like it good lord so the thought that I've had on my heart today is unconditional love and it's been quite a blessing for me to get this one together and it may may seem like now we often just talk about unconditional love and you hear it and a lot of it's a bit of a feel-good it could be a feel-good theme and you can just sort of you know make it up wish you wash you think and in some ways there's a bit of truth to that what it is but you know there's a there is a deep drunkenness or love that when we realize that young conditional love towards us personally it's been a nice experience for me and I've just got a few of my controlling this now I just want to read a few a few scriptures during one of our first on 4 verse 8 says he that loveth not knoweth not God for god is love and first John 4:16 says and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God and him you can take your seats under Steve he made a little bless the reading of his word praise the Lord now that's something that the world needs more of but unfortunately it's not going to get more of as we reject Christ we ultimately reject love that's this the way that this thing works you know we try and go about this process some other way and yet there is really no other way apart from bidding the love of God come in and dwell on us and manifest that love and as the world gets darker they'll be listening this love but there will never be no love at all but unfortunately what we we see events happen we see things happen that a just seemed to be void of love you know and it's a it's it it said it said mister brings our sadness know when we see these but I want to read a scripture I'm just gonna get into the hook that's I've got a few to get through but I want to read the scripture and this is when Jesus was meeting with the Pharisees and it sees a nezzie spake cousin Luke 11 did he seem him to 42 as he spake a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with them and he went in and sat down to meet when the Pharisees saw it he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner and the Lord said unto Him now do you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the pleasure but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness he fools did not he that made that which is without make back with chisel then also but rather give arms of such things such things as you have and behold all things are clean unto you but woe unto you Pharisees we tithe mint and Rue and all manner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of God these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone you pass over judgment in the love of God now who doesn't wash your hands before they eat I've got a bad habit of doing that and my argument is like the Lord says I say well the disciples ate with unwashen hands hey when you're from the bush you know you just kind of hey you know you just you kind of fuzzy you the hands are all dirty anyway you just kind of get into it but it's actually it's probably a bad habit to do like like um maybe study photos from the city here Saudi folk her but more proper rate country folk her a bit more rough and rugged I don't know why I'm saying it but hey but that's that's where I come from no got in the bush we kind of just get into it but but you to these Pharisees it was such a big deal that the Jesus it was they they they must have rated this quite high in their and their things they thought were important and that but you know it wasn't really overly important Jesus he looks ultimately it doesn't really matter you know just hands you know that's not the thing that really makes you unclean but I like it how he said you pass over judgment and the love of God and the to actually go together because judgment God's love drove him to take judgment right so judgment and the love of God go hand in hand pass over judgment in the love of God now we're going to be talking about love this morning but different facets of love and then I want to get into unconditional love but we want to talk this idea called love love who enjoys love makes you feel good a love like if I didn't live I had to live with that love would be very very unhappy I enjoy love I enjoy being involved in love I enjoy loving situations with us with this love now were you're involved in it in a moment where there's a lot of love thank you do you like that you know when you feel and it makes you feel good it's love God is love and I think as a Christian we enjoy love we enjoy being in an atmosphere of love and we can we can we can recognize what love is in open up your heart to love know who's quite an emotional person I'm actually believe it or not I'm actually a very emotional person I get overwhelmed my stuff all the time I may not seem like I do but I get overwhelmed most up all the time I'm an emotional person and I actually like emotion I like embracing emotion I like embracing love I like being in situations where you feel things and when you can with someone achieve something in you you think man I'm so happy they achieved it you know and I've actually had tears in my eyes and I've here keys and wires and the most silliest of places like events and things you know that you crying about I actually do sometimes I try and hide it but I the emotion of these things into seeing someone do stuff to well or seeing things I like I like love right now I got the set of the Strongs definition of love as lovers to love to be full of goodwill and exhibit the same to have a preference for which well to regard that well Thomas liked it it's like this good feeling right that we love it is it it's just a nice thing and I think when you're a Christian more and more you like you appreciate love if you want to give me more love just give me more love I like it now I'll do the same for you to be full of goodwill and exhibit the same hey that's what we say you know in a nice relationship with somebody as as love back and forth I love you You Love Me we you know we we do that towards each other and we appreciate each other company and we grow together and we we're happy right that's that's love now just bear with me as I go through these things this is where Paul talks about love and it's from first Corinthians 13:1 and he says though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not love I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling some I got another translation here just sometimes it's easier to get the idea of different words if I speak in the tongues of men or of angels but do not have love I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal he knows what gong is Fritsche note of gong is one of those things down there by the Japanese thought phone to announce some sort of event happening or something Gong makes a whole lot of noise you know a symbol like this but you know all says if I could all my talking that I could do if I didn't have love I'm just like a whole lot of noise with no real substance to it right love has got a life to it love is something richer then just a natural thing it's actually got life and he's saying if I could speak all with different tongues and I could know everything and if I talked about this but didn't have love don't forget that as we go through have love not feel love but have love I'm becoming this flame brother and you and I were talking about it the other day it's just like chitter-chatter chitter-chatter you know brother Brown talks about right and he says and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love I'm nothing so I could do all these wonderful things even have faith to work all sorts of miracles and have not love I'm still nothing that's it would do me no good then he says even if I do loving things right and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor who's given all the goods away to feed the poor at some point in time and you'd have to be quite a loving guy to do their day you give boy all your stuff to feed the poor he's saying even if I give all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not love it profits me nothing or if we say the other one is and if I give all wife is to feed the poor and if I surrender my body to be burned but do not have love it profits me nothing but that's actually a loving act and yet he's saying up I don't have love it's not really any value to me because get into it a bit later but you know true love is actually the Holy Ghost right that's what actually true lovers are these saying so Paul in these verses is actually saying I could do all these things you know if I don't have love itself dwelling in me then what benefit is that all to me at end of the day what what benefit is this whole thing it really is of no value if I don't have that have love itself okay that's the that's the truth behind this verse so it would appear like you're doing a loving deed and yet how can you do a loving big with no love he's not talking about that love he's talking about the love of God which dwells in us by the Holy Ghost but now let's just get into this idea of love now for a minute and the emotion of love because I want to talk about that for a bit to kind of get into this concept of this feeling of love Matthew 9 verse 10 to 13 says it came to pass as Jesus said it meet and their house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples I'm just gonna stop here and tell you he remembers brother Joseph barley from Tauranga now he came out of it yeah he's a real nice guy he came out of a like a rough background and I think I don't know if he meet brother Andy and prisoner was brother I think was brother Ian do you know if he was he got saved in prison here's testimony maybe here or maybe was at that but he's a he had a rough life growing up and then God had mercy upon him and when he's preached this testimony it was actually back in Gisborne this was the verse he used and when he read the lines that I've underlined here he said it so powerful that I knew he meet what he was reading so well this verse has always struck me because this was the basis of what his testimony was like he read through this and he said and when the Pharisees saw it they stood unto his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners but when Jesus heard it he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick but go and learn what that meaneth I will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am come to call for I'm not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance I will have mercy not sacrifice so God is coming down and he's saying I'm here to actually have mercy mercy it's such a nice feeling isn't it mercy like a night when you think about the concept of mercy who's ever asked for forgiveness for something for someone maybe you've missed up with even your husband or wife or something you've missed that and you've said look you're so remorseful of it and you feel so bad and you say look I'm sorry and they genuinely tell you look it's alright they have mercy who's had that happen to you before you feel good I feel good because you receive mercy mercy is such a nice thing and mercy and love are all wrapped up together it's this desire that you would want someone to be built up rather than torn down because if you say to them look it's alright don't worry about it I forgive you I eat it let's move on you you're actually encouraging me to grow and she'll learn because you know that they've learned from whatever mistake that they've made or whatever it was you think I don't want you to wallow there I want you to just learn from it move on move up you know mercy such a wonderful feeling in Jesus the Heart of Jesus is actually mercy mercy and love he's here and he's saying I will have mercy and not sacrifice but so I want to just tell you a few just to get our mind thinking about there's good good thoughts of this heartwarming type of thing called love right because we we can be involved in situations that half woman would do stuff to someone and we we we feel good about it or we can have someone do something to us and it's heartwarming this this story here there were there were two boys walking along the road and they see a pair of boots on the side of this road and they look out in the field and there's an old man working out in the field and they see the boots there and the young boy says hey I've got an idea what we should do we should hide his boots and then we'll sneak up in the tree and we'll watch him and when he comes back we'll watch them be all confused them flex this dude where are my boots who's taken my boots then we'll watch them walk around try and find his boots in well we have a bit of a laugh and then when he goes we'll sneak off and the older boy that was with him he said to the young boy he said no I don't think that's such a good idea by the looks of these boots these are these are old boots these are worn down boots by the looks of these boots this man looks like a poor man it looks like he's struggling why don't we do something different why don't we take one of our dollars and why don't I take one of my silver dollars and I'll put one in one boot and you put one in the other boot then we'll go hide in the tree and we'll watch him and we'll see what he does when he sees that he's got an extra $2.00 and his boots and the young boys okay let's do that so they put the dollar in each booth and they win and they hit man the old man comes in from working in the field and he goes to put his boots on he puts one on and he feels something under his heel so I reaches down and he sees a silver dollar and a small comes on his face and he goes to put his other boot on and he sees another it was another lump under his other heel and he puts his hand and his boot and he sees the other dollar and then the the boys are watching this man and tears start to come to his eyes and he drops down to his knees this is old god you know how much I'm struggling you know how much that I've got a wife and little children you know and there we don't have much food and I'm just doing all that I can to survive and yet you've now given me two dollars and he raises hands up he said thank you Lord for doing this for me and whoever's whoever's actually put that in there may god bless him and he went on his way rejoicing is happy and the older boy said to the young boy walking away he said didn't your heart get warm when you watch that situation that's called hot woman and exit Bluffs make our heart warm right there's a hot woman and that's that's love that's what we can experience when we receive or give acts of love the betterment of someone else I want to tell you another of the story who knows just the Cure is sister Shannon Tina we're free to experience in America Virginian so this is during the Civil War and the the Confederate troops were in Fredericksburg and the Union troops they had been given orders to attack free Pittsburgh and they had to because they thought if they can get that in that's their main headquarters and and then it could defeat the the Confederate Army so the the Confederate Army they were well fortified in this town because they got word that the trip coming so they had a chance to fortify themselves and up on the back Hill here you can see they had all their cannons up along the back then they had a big rock wall right around the front and all the men stood around the wall who said of Stonewall Jackson here was commanding the guys that were on that wall and robert e lee was there as well and I don't I can't remember the other guys names that were attacking and then the guys on the rock wall they would have a system where there would be two or three lines of them and so the front guys would the plan was the front guys would shoot then they would step back and reload while the guys behind them stood up and they shot well the other guys reloaded so it was that it was just bang bang bang so they they were attacked one day by the Union troops that was in late December so it was winter and the Union troops got massacred they just keep going wave after wave all day to try and attack these guys but the cannons were getting shot at them from up on top of the hill on them and then as soon as they got close they were just getting mowed down one guy that we and gave a report back to I think was Abraham Lincoln and said it was that was a it was a butchery what happened there I think there were 12,000 men that died in one day out on this open battlefield so at night they all pull back and you can imagine that night the people on one side and on the other side all they could hear what just sick wounded people out in the battlefield moaning in just because they're all just sitting out there bullets and then there's an awful situation and you can imagine the night as a war went on and that silence of the night came down or you could hear what these men and that thousands of men in the field moaning in the morning in the morning there was a Confederate soldier that I think by the by the time the morning came around he just something came over him he thought this is the whole situation just wrong not this is not right and so he could hear these guys out there just crying out for water dehydrated in just that maybe lost all their blood in it and so this man said to all his comrades give me all your water canteens so he loaded himself up with water canteens he hopped over the wall and he the first man he saw he started giving him some water well the Union guys on the other side thought that here's a man trying to rob the dead bodies so they took a few shots at him but he just stayed out there and when they looked through their telescope at this man they realized he's not actually stealing their guns and things he's actually going around giving them water and for three hours for three hours this man went and gave water to all these soldiers for three hours or just by himself went all around all around because he felt you know we shouldn't just be leaving these guys he did if you're gonna shoot me shoot me I don't care I'm gonna give I'm gonna help these guys out in and it was a selfless act of love that he did and I think that the people on both sides just sit and watched and saw this one man just in the midst of hate and the midst of all this hate someone could just show some love and it touched the touch thing I don't think they think they're both was true after that but his name was Richard Kirkland they called him the angel of Mary's Heights and you know when we do acts of love they live on you know that it's a saying hero never dies but a coward dies a thousand times now if you die as a coward you just get your name you strung down every time someone talks about you here's the coward it was this he was that but they hear I never dies they even made a monument for him right by where the stone wall was and it says at the risk of us his and memoriam Richard Roland Kirkland at the risk of his life this American soldier of sublime sublime compassion brought water to his wounded foes at Fredericksburg the fighting men on both sides of the line caught in the angel of Mary's house as legacy lives on because he showed an act of love and no doubt it would have touched the people that were watching would have touched their hearts about what this man did right that's love now it makes you make sure you ponder it makes you feel good and would have made the mean Fonda when they are watching as to what they were seeing right so we just we're just trying to talk about this emotion of love and these other ones I can't really um I have to play you some video because I it's hard to describe these different situations I can talk about those stories but that's this here these here I like moments where someone was happy or they became bitter and they were they felt good and then the emotion of the moment overcame then there was a and it wasn't a moment of hate it was a moment of love and different in different forms right because I want to try and just paint a picture for you and get an idea of this thing called love and how how it affects us right who said some is it really different there's just flowers we got for him how about landed no we just put them there cuz it's winter look at your kids eyes Petey they're so pretty [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the fries buddy mommy did good job surprises gonna take your goggles off real quick [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] funny can you look at the case they look up at the frisbee so that's you know as a Christian we should be able to embrace they'll be scared to embrace the emotion of love you know a cold stony heart it's hard for him to to embrace love right but as a Christian we should be overwhelmed a lot of the day yeah when we spend time with friends with believers and that and just different things because we're we can be recipients of the emotion of love because it's a part of us brother branham I think was a very emotional man know he would be maybe go back to his old childhood place and it'd be just tears flowing down his cheeks and now that's that's just to be able to feel Italy let the beauty of life you know life is a beautiful thing the beauty of love come and embrace it we're not crazy we're not Irie fury people with Christians right yeah now I want to start reading you something brother Brown says now I just like to tell you what my secret of the greatest how do you like to tell tonight what I think is the greatest most powerful force it was on earth would you like me to tell you about it and a few minutes you might not love me so well after this because I would just tell you all the mightiest force errors on earth is love that's exactly it is nothing that would break down love no matter what it is whatever you are or what you you might have seen you might have danced in the spirit you might have spoke with tongues you might have shook the oldest hand you might have been baptized three times this way backwards face wood anywhere you want but until love anchors in your heart you saw out of God that's right that's right you've got to have love and the Bible said God is love and God love is the strongest force no tear me down a bit bro now I want to read you just another another passage you'd know the story but I want to read it again just to now start getting the sort of the most powerful force there is a sort of few weeks ago where there was a big teeny richter not slamming God forgive we're a man city who cast out evil spirits which I have no doubt of that but evil spirits are not cast out by cruel and different living the most powerful weapon there is in the world is love I stood by a lady the other night we are husband was fixing to leave here and marry another woman very fine known couple I looked at her and said she said well I'm going to leave brother Brennan I said don't do it sister told me oh my husband has ministry ministry will be ruined now what can I do I'm going to go to New York and I'm going to get me a job I said don't do it don't do it sister what can I do brother Brennan go up to him see oh I found the lady's picture and I broke it up I done so and so I said I see that but I see go to him and put your arms around him and say sweetheart no matter what you've done I still love you that'll do it that's right the most powerful force in the world a young couple young fella came to me not long ago now you all know the story he was a Pentecostal it seen too much of these meetings then he goes his wife was a staunch Lutheran he said oh I guess you're with young and shouted last night said I guess you was all speaking in tongues and doing all this last night he got down on the floor said god I cast the devil out of here I cast the devil out of here almost a divorce case the man a fine man he came to me he said brother Brennan we're going to heaven divorce like this he said I just can't get the devil to move out of here I said brother you're going at it the wrong way when she starts like that sake all right there bless your heart honey and be real kind to her just see how much you can do for her see a brother Brennan well how will they ever get the devil out I said you do as I say and just keep praying in your heart see and I see it and God will take care of the rest of it he called me up about two or three weeks later he said my home has revolutionized he said my wife was a different person I said which is the most which is the most powerful screaming and kicking in or putting your arms around here and love God is love if you also love the world yes since my faith I saw the stream dye fly wound supplied redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die okay now now he's saying you can do all the shouting and carrying on and all the stuff but ultimately the most powerful forces love this this force called love now when we watch those videos before me this there was an emotion that came with it right and it was a force and if you're an emotional person that probably makes you cry it's a force that has it doesn't just sit there and do nothing it has a bit yes right so if you administer true love it actually has an effect on human beings and it's powerful it can break down things you can break things down they can overcome things it overcome hate that's what the Bible says be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good overcome with love that's why the Bible says love your enemies right it's a powerful force another quote here if you love them you know love is the greatest force here we have the most powerful force do you believe that love would just do things that nothing else will do do things that nothing else will do just think about that now here's where you might think I'm going but eerie fury here right but I'm not but ultimately God's love fills the whole earth right it actually it actually feels it's it's everywhere God's love it actually fills the earth right now now the reason why I say that it's because now take this picture here right when it's all said and done when everything's over and you've got people and eternity with God and people souls in hell you tell me that you can have a heartwarming feeling in hell it's going to be void of any emotion of love right void of anything you couldn't say oh you look hurting over there is anything I could do to help you there won't be any any part of this heartwarming anything to either receive or give and it's gonna be void of that right you understand void of all love therefore if you can actually feel love here even a non believer and unbeliever you can then what is that it's got to be God it's got to be God it's just it's it's it's everywhere and it just fills the whole earth because God is actually still here working in it and if he's around he's a God of love then this this emotion of love and all different forms is going to manifest itself you understand and in heaven what it's going to be as perfect love this perfect doesn't love of goodwill and everything you measure in a place like that with it's no evil no no negativity right but but here that's why I say God's love actually fills the whole earth at the moment it's it's just here right happening and has the same it's the same as this concept as as power does through faith it's same concept you don't need to be a Christian to have faith to get something to happen even a miracle right because the Bible says if you can believe there's a concept of faith that will say if you can't believe this then this will happen and it works for anybody as power is not oh well you don't you haven't done what I say therefore I'm not going to answer your desire of faith you can be a non-christian anything I want to achieve this great thing and if you have faith enough in that you'll achieve it right that's that's just the way this thing works it just it's just here on earth that's just the principle that's here it's the same as love it's just here and we can experience it whether we're a loving person or not we can experience love a sort of funny photo and in a certain example of it it's a the photo it was a little little two-year-old kid giving a this gangster guy a toy phone and the caption said it doesn't matter how gangster you think you are if a two-year-old gives you a toy phone you answer it you know that's that's a is the little thing somewhere that just puts all this I'm a bad guy side and answers that little phone for the little guy you know it's it's still love here right on really this quote here you know I'm getting into unconditional love shortly and Jesus meets with men in different circles in a different numbers one time he met with 500 another time he met with 70 once with his 12 once with three and he will come to 100 sold no matter what size the circle is we how many peoples gathered Christ is omnipresent and he is the only being there IRA's that's omnipresent which means everywhere at the same time he's an omnipresent being he's everywhere at the same time the devil cannot be omnipresent God is the only one who's omnipresent it's everywhere he fills all the heavens in all the earth there's omnipresent God at this point time is everywhere and the whole earth right so incest and and you can you can embrace them or experience them in any part of the earth at any point time it's everywhere and this verse here says there's one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all there's just this almighty great spirit of love and there's one of their to be just love right soaps everywhere it was they what they picture was maybe it's a little bit my mind as I don't mind the stuff but it was these these men that we were during the civil rights movement these the African Americans couldn't go on the buses so they headache to protest a group of African Americans and white people went on these buses they called them the Freedom Riders and they rode on these buses and sat in the seats in and it was just pure evil what was heading to them they would turn up into a place and mobs of these obviously what people would be in these southern towns to beat up all these guys as soon as they got off the bus there and the police would say no we give you 15 minutes to do what if you want they will turn up 15 minutes later and they would just beat these men up I'll show you right and some of them are Christians some are not but they were just fighting for a good cause this man on the man on the right I can't remember his name is the African American and the other men here's a testimony where he said when he was about to get off the bus he prayed nurse how they said Lord how me not to fight back with these people any city had a spiritual experience then unlike anything he's ever had to that point board afterwards he said he felt such an overwhelming love and peace come upon him and he just knew everything is going to be aright and he and with with this feeling he just walked off and he got beaten up and he actually got in the paper and actually what he did changed from his image being in the paper before heaven determined they began to the cycle of change for that situation but an overwhelming feeling of love and pieces he just took over him that was just God just Kaman and embrace the situation and he just could go through what he went through now but to move on so it doesn't become a lyric area we think God is just love and everything is just you know because this is the deceiving thing about this emotion of love right now we know these scriptures that God is love but then there's another scripture down the bottom of 1st John 1:5 Allah says and this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you God is light and in him is no darkness at all now when you think of light you think of God which is purity light holy right and when you think of darkness you think of sin and perversion and and anything that is not of God right as darkness is that's why we call it the kingdom of light the kingdom of darkness so now well then this great being as well as being a God of love he's actually also as well as being loved he's actually he's also light right and him is no darkness no sin no no no nothing now I want to know why I say that was I want to now start painting a picture so now put a balance on this emotion of love which is a genuine godly thing we experienced and I've got this picture here because I could say a situation where a let's say one girl has a friend and she knows that her friend has always wanted to get her hair done at this particular hairdresser but it's it's so expensive there and she can't afford it and her birthday is coming up and she wants to surprise her friend and so she gathers her other she says look this is what we'll do we'll well um we'll all go as a group and we'll meet her there for her birthday and we'll all put in and we'll pay for her to get the best haircut that she's ever wanted you know she can get a hit guide and this you can get a cat and get it all looking real nice and no friends say oh that's such a nice thing to do you let's do that for her right hot woman yeah let's go and and then they they they say I'll meet us for coffee summary so they're gonna surprise her and then they that sexually the coffee place is actually a they're hideous and they say surprise we've actually we're going to pay to get your haircut we know your boys wanted to get it down here and oh come on oh she's overwhelmed with what the love they showed you well that's so nice I love you all they're hugging right right now this is real love this is not this is real love but this is how Satan can start to actually use love to deceive people use this emotion to deceive people so then the next thing is she goes in there and wrapped up within that act of love it's a hair cut off which is actually an act of hate right it's darkness you know it's it's not god that's darkness and they to actually encourage it to do that hate you so so we'll then this emotion of love within this time is hate comes with it it's darkness now you can say that's not God because because in him is no darkness at all so within their situation they were portions of God if I could put it that way but it there was darkness in it so it's not fully God right so with Satan always he uses the emotion of love to deceive people because we now we think our this thing could be Christians eyes is such a good friend to me my other friend doesn't agree with all of us but look at this good time we're having here look at how loving it is and you're doing an act of hate right now here's another one for the guys you know no but he loved me but then I met the boys and the gang and they they live like now they were so good to me they booked me in in my brother's arms are any show that we family now bro and it's genuine maybe they were maybe they came from a rough time and they had a rough life and and some other men and frase then see if we look after you and it was it's a genuine actual act of love will embrace you will care for you were your family now no doubt that man would have been overwhelmed and I feel like I've got family now hear me I've never had these guys care for me and now because we love you we're going to go and here have a cigarette that's going to kill you this get drunk that's gonna you know ruin your kidneys leach there's all these things that's actually going to kill you well then this love will kill you at the same time see if they're deceiving it's using the emotion to deceive right so so this is just to keep a balance so we don't get all caught up on the see motion and then we churches use God Satan uses the same thing through churches you know just tell me if you are God loves you as you are and you can just stay as you are any way that you are now that's the truth right because God is a he's an embrace and God and he says come all you that are weary come you that are thirsty come right then it's and you feel good if someone if you're weary and someone says come I'll help you you're gonna feel good so you come but but you see they bring them in by love they use Satan uses the emotion of love to bring them in and they say all this church really embrace me and made me feel like family and they helped me I was I didn't have many things and then they came and they gave me things for my house and they just they just love me and and and I'm so happy there and at the same time the church is teaching them things that I that doesn't matter in the Word of God that doesn't matter that doesn't matter if it's okay forget about this but there's love there right it's because of such a powerful force Satan actually uses it uses that powerful force to deceive people because it's so powerful he's gonna have more luck trying to use that emotion then use the emotion of hope you're somewhat swimmers laughs let me see you heard some say I came into the truth because I said don't come we don't want you here we never want to see your face here and that really made me want to go now they use the emotion that Satan uses this emotion of love right but if there's darkness in it it's not you got to watch it it's not all it's not all right these guys here are beginning now to preach our gospel Love Wins what did I read about brother Graham says love is the most powerful force on the earth love conquers all right love always wins now the now the homosexual people are saying loved ones others most powerful force love will win and it's getting so much momentum because they've been they've tried you Satan's got this idea of love so why can't I just love whoever I want to love of ones that's what we see and yet it's so it's a perverted way because what they're saying that it should one end is sin right and now if we now oppose it we are called a hater right but but but they actually the thing they're doing is darkness so it's all it's very deceiving here to see loved ones that's the new it's a new hashtag loved ones now we could say Amen to their right because it we don't know we see this stuff and it puts you off what it you love you know you think that I just but don't let it put you off because true that there is still true love right but we for sometimes we can get so discouraged by all the stuff we see we think I'll I'll just become a bit cold don't do that stay emotional they love him stay still let love embrace you and do these things but temper it with light which is what we're gonna go to you I'll just give you one more example of us here's a here's a this man winning with a baseball bat to Robert a shop and the guy behind the counter he always carried a gun under his counter this is the miracle obviously and so he comes out with this gun and when the man realizes that the guy's got a gun he he immediately said look please don't shoot me don't shoot me I'm look I just I don't hear food I've got children that are starving I was actually coming here just to get something so I could get some food and he was this man was crying the sudden me I said please and don't tell the police because I'll just end up going through the court system I'm gonna I'll be even a worse estate to look after my family just please just let me go and this man was genuinely remorseful and he was it tears down his eyes and the shopkeeper said he must have seen the emotion of it and he said look okay I can see you you're genuine I can see you actually meant that you you weren't a bad guy coming to do harm to me you were just trying to steal something to feed yourself and feed your family nest even scripture the Bible says you know that a man won't despise a thief if he's stealing to feed his family you know but then any piece gets caught in it to pay it back but he actually won't think you know he's a bad guy if he's actually doing it for someone else that's a funny concept right and and so the man gives some $40 in a loaf of bread he sees here go and take that and I won't tell the police will do nothing nice story right now that now the man of the ground says on one other thing because you've shown me this love I want to become a Muslim just like you they said you can become Muslim you recite the one of the five pillars of a lie for cyclists there's no god but Muhammad Muhammad is the Messenger of God he recited that now I'm a Muslim and he converted to Islam through that act right yeah now and and now the Muslim community we use this and say that's what a true Muslim is he shows love and this is how we can convert people right now don't we say the same thing see see it's a it's a it's used in different forms because it's such a powerful force now I just read this again I've got this one again you know love is the greatest force we have the most powerful force do you believe that love local will just do things that nothing else will do so now here's here's a statement I want to make then I want to I want to bring another concept God's unconditional all-powerful undefeatable redeeming love as we've talked about acts of love now we get into this force of love itself the pure form of love itself that's just so powerful you you think of the power in this love the overcoming power that exists within this embodiment of perfect love itself think of how powerful that thing is we just have snippets of it here and there but here is the very center point of the thing itself my statement is it has to be specifically limited to certain ones otherwise the whole world will be saved and overcome by it right I'll show this picture here right now we say love is everywhere you know this because God is actually as it stands as existent right but there's a center point is that there's a center point of this great love that is housed somewhere right now and that's that's in the heart of God that's God right now my statement is of that if that love just flowed towards the earth unrestrained towards everybody who could possibly be lost ever how could any soul ever be lost because this is the most powerful force there is there would be no force that could combat it that was strong enough to hold back something that it was after it's the most powerful force that there is so it has to somehow be it has to be directed specifically somehow otherwise it would just be a whitewash you understand that this most this powerful thing called love when we get to the source of love itself the actual source that that fun point now here's the answer to that right now this is where unconditional love where the redeeming love of God begins to touch my heart and overwhelm me the Bible says according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before them and love now I mentioned before God's love has got to be specifically directed his unconditional love not just his like we can have parts of it on the earth and we can get these good feelings and we can do all these things and now we're talking about a specific choice that my love is going to go directly to you unconditionally and it's going to keep at you right and it's a relationship who does it go really who does it go to right his children this it's it's specifically directed although he's on earth and he he's a good god and he does all these things and you can experience love in different forms the direct source of his love as for his children I don't know if this will work because I don't know who's here right but I want to just use this just look at this picture who have we got in this room I know you if you're looking at it you've seen yourself in me right because we all like ourselves right we love ourselves so you know whenever you see a picture you look through it and you look for yourself think all these me who does that be honest hey hey the Bible says no man hates their own body they love themselves you know that's what we should care for ourselves other place we would run ourselves into the ground and maybe you know maybe die but we love ourselves right now when you have a child it's like if it's kind of a similar love you you would you almost would love that child more than you love yourself so when you see a photo you'll glance over other people's children if you've got children first you look at yourself then you'll glance over other people's children and you find your own obvious my children hey if you now if you haven't got children you can just say that that's what you do for yourself if you've got children you like if I went back to here and I could sister Hannah you know we were your children in that picture you could probably tell me roughly where they would hey we were they yeah on the right thing be on the right side of the back see then and where we and we were your children but over yes these are as a as a parent there's a specific love you have for your children it'll pass over other children and your love as specific towards them right no I've been at events even to achieve its you know and I'm studying with one of the we're just sitting in a group talking in one of the sisters will say ah he's so cute we're both looking out at the same children playing out and somewhere and you say what she says look at my son look what he's doing Oh oh yes - but I'm not now I like children and that right but but I'm not specifically interested in his son you know what I mean so I'm not my eye isn't watching them maybe I'm saying oh that's all right but look what my son's doing over here hey right that's how we that's this relationship it will pass over other people but it's specific this love is specific so now now this is where we get into the this idea that the the all-powerful redeeming love of God it's got a specific channel and a conditional love in its towards this children well though it's whosoever will now these scriptures are hard to take sometimes but it's the truth of the matter romans 9 13 says as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Jacob as my son this was not now Paul says that when you think of it as he say what is your unrighteousness with God God for but he says on whom he led moose Elliot moose on whom he'll harden he hardens who are you to argue against God this is the way God does it if you're a son or his daughter then you are going to get unconditional love directed at you now it comes in different forms but directed at you from the day you were born even before you're born right I want to read you these scriptures just to get get it get this can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of who won the answer actually is yes it is possible for a mother sometimes they forget their child right yes they can they may forget yet well I not forget thee behold I have graven II on the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me he's talking about his son Israel I will not forget you I'm gonna read these scriptures then I'm going to get into something then jesus answered them I told you in Berlin you believe not the works that I do my father's name they be a witness of me but you believe not because you're not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck him out of my father's hand I and my father are one now he's confident in his ability of his love to get those things that he desires right it's the most powerful force there was nothing if someone's a son of God there is nothing a predestinate a seed of God there was nothing they could ever stop God's redeeming love from getting them right but I want to show you in a little but he doesn't just go off I save you right man's got to make a free world but that's the beauty of this love how it works here's another one and this is the father as well of what she has sent me that all of which he had given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up gain at the last day yeah here they are go and get them right go and redeem them with your love and there's powerful force of love here are my children one more for I've given unto thee in the words which thou gave us me and they have received him and if non surely that I came from out from thee and they had believed that they had seen me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all miner thine and thine or mine and I am glorified in them I pray not for the world I just pray for the ones you've given me now to put it in a softer context I don't really care about your children it's just my children I'm interested hey now now we come back to this one and this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all I want to get this concept back in our mind and now this concept of love right this this this redeeming love because now we've got this being that's that's total right and total love pursuing us how is it going to pursue us because we talk about Paul talks about in Corinthians about love it says charity but it's love love suffers long and is kind love Envy it's not love or it's not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinks no evil rejoices not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth believes all things fearful things hopes all things endures all things so this love rejoices not an iniquity but rejoices in the truth it doesn't have an ability to ever accept iniquity it doesn't even have the ability it doesn't ever have the ability to embrace any sort of darkness right you'll see where I'm going with us right now here's a statement now the unconditional this love of God is pursuing your free will through what bring you into a into a church that's the zhibing church bring you into just have a good time somewhere now because it's full of life and truth it can only bring you until it wants to pursue your free will for you to accept Christ for your day because it knows where's the truth it's Christ as the truth and the truth of your day that Christ and your day the actual the Christ walking in your time right because in him is no darkness at all and this love is pursuing you concealing your free will it's gonna by this force of love it's gonna pursue you to bring you through the truth it's tampering you any other place to the real truth right that's why the Holy Ghost is actually truth and it's love right it's it's the it's the real thing now now I want to just think about this talk about this for a moment we talk about our freewill right we're born with the freewill okay now true love won't override your free will because it doesn't want you to do anything you don't want to do is that true if you love someone then and I have a funny thing we witnessed it was a family member that was um having a bit of a dispute with their wife right and we were we were there and they were having an argument and then we heard this voice say all angry look hold my hand and you know like in other words like heartache and an act of love towards me but do it against your will and that's the whole a joke whenever we have a fuss you know love true love won't say look if you don't I will say if you don't want to hold my hand you know I don't want you to hold my hand I only want you to hold my hand if you really want to I'm not going to make you hold my hand right that's that's this concept of love right it won't make you do anything you don't want to do as a world yeah it's like you've you know and and and this side of the equation you understand and love will actually give you all all the facts before you make a choice who's been deceived by a sneaky salesman a they they they quickly tell you what's great about this thing but they know they're not telling you the dumb things about it they know it's probably not going to suit your purpose they just want to get your money so they just they tell you it's good it's this in that year year year and then you get it and it doesn't work for what you want it to do and falls apart it's rubbish you've been deceived haven't told you all the facts right but now now this love it can't deceive you and it will actually tell you all the facts that's why when when you hear them with that the message all men of God speaking they speak you the absolute truth give you all the facts this is what you're going to be this is what you are getting involved in right and it scares most people away but it's the hundred percent facts this is the truth it's not a watered down see other churches will water down the truth to get you in not tell you all the facts and when you get under you think I didn't realize almost like that's all they say no that doesn't really matter they'll deceive you but they but true love that's why we've got it's got to come to the messenger of that time which is actually telling the truth and now it's it seems unattractive right that the gospel seems so unattractive to the unbeliever they think what could you possibly be interested in going into something like that right that's the way that this thing works but Satan will trick you into a green is something you really didn't want right that's what hate does it will deceive you okay now now the reason why I said that was because God pursues that let me go this first right firstly you've got this you've got a you've got God you've got this love that that wanted to come out and redeem somehow right when man was lost this love you think about it it was sitting there and it wanted to actually come out and it knew that the only way that it could actually come out as by as by God knew here to become one of us take our sins in order for that love to be expressed to us I'm gonna go into this one yeah this is what I'm gonna get to because this is this is what I was talking about before right let's talk about free will right free will and free will and and God's hewing love for you yeah we're all different right you're all different everyone's made different now I'm gonna put it this way before you're born God studies you think about this he studies you before you're born who is he st. let's say you can do this say you've been just conceived right the hennas being conceived now now God gets word no I'm gonna dramatize it slightly God gets word that one of his children has been conceived this may be a an alarm goes off someone gives God a message there's someone on their way right someone's on their way now I put this picture up here because it shows a builder studying maybe studying a job before he starts he wants to learn the facts what am i building what am i making here right now God study is sister henna ok he won't even ask boy or girl knows that any word on what they're thinking about calling her you ever decided you okay now let's see how she's made I want all the data on her own all the information whose appearance okay who's your grandparents who's their great-great grandparents what components of mankind have gone into here to form the way that her mind works and to form how her free will operates what are all the different components of it how does she what will she respond to see that's the way now love according to exactly how she is this love from the day she's born will begin pursuing her and different ilk for you brother Eden different way of us uses the henna right but it's studied here studied brother yet it's study sister Shannon on because it what it knows you've got a free will and it's not going to make you make up your mind but it's going to pursue your free will and do all sorts of things within circumstances who eventually get you to surrender your free will you understand that it's going to one and it's just suit against you but it's not going to make you make a choice it's not going to but it knows sister Hannah's mind works like this therefore I'll fight bring her if she has these situations happen in her life this will start to change here that cool I know how she works in God sis great masterbuilder he will begin to know there may be things that he knows if that happens that here it will be really bad so he'll stop it but he might think that person needs this bad thing to happen to them because their mind works this way that it's only through that that eventually later on down the line I can get and here with us he's pursuing your free will who won't accept him well that's that's that's the unconditional love that he has towards those children because you at some point in your life have to say Lord I surrender you understand you you can't just get saved we're not surrendering but you have to make their choice yourself but it's this unconditional pursuing love for you that's working specifically in your life before you were born you understand this has to be the way that it works and and now we think we do that and then and then when sister Hannah makes that choice whatever situation it was it says but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons or daughters of God even then they believed on his name she this this love regardless of what any ever did you might have pushed it away done all the stuff but it's it's it's never gives up it's always pursuing it will never ever stop and say oh I give up that one's too hard it will never ever ever do that it will always pursue and will always win what does children but now now you get to another another thing about this unconditional love towards you as if you get to a point where you surrender you say Lord I surrender my well because that's what we want to do right we sweet lord I surrender my will to you and I surrender to the crisis of my day I surrender all okay and you've been given all the facts your but but God has worked in your life and whichever way whatever situation to bring you to that place it was God drawing you it wasn't you like I one day I decided it was God working hard sometimes for 30 40 years working working working he never stops working doesn't from from the day you are conceived he starts working you're his job I'm gonna work and he's not lazy he's diligent how does she work Carnegie knew who her parents are they going to cause a lot of trouble not trouble we're friends all we need just but he's counteracting every situation from Satan he's just doing it all to get you but then when you get to a place where you where you at Rousseau daughter of God surrender to the Christ for your day right you surrender your will now now you've got a different way that this love is predicted to you now because you say because God says I came now that you have surrendered your will by your own choice now I'll override your will right he won't override your will before you've surrendered your will he won't say well even though you don't want to come I'm gonna make you come come now right when you surrender your will he will actually now override your will right because that's this is now a continuation of perfect love towards you and now this is where we get into our walk where it becomes now training where it becomes you know we do something wrong we get chastised yeah it's not my will that God put this on my life and make my life miserable for a short amount of time that's not my will but but God knows even though you don't want this I'm going to do it to you because it's going to be better for you right that's now that's now unconditional love working in our life it's you know we heard a chastisement this is it never stops working on us and it begins to put us through situations in our life there actually we don't want to go through its seemingly unfair to us or hard on us you know because we think I really don't want to go through this but God says no because I love you I know this is better for you and I own you and because you've told me that I can override your will because you've surrendered it then I'm going to put you through this because I know it's been a few even though you at the time don't feel good about this whole thing you may even question why I'm doing it but I'm going to endure that because I know it's better for you and I've got to put you through this you've been to situations where you say lord I can't take this anymore God might think now you can take this this is only twenty five percent of what you can take you can take this for another seventy five percent and even though you think you can't I know you can and even though you might say God take this away I'm not going to take because I might the same love that I did to pursue you to pursue your will is now the same love that's gonna change and mold and make you and make you grown and bring you into the sketch of a perfect man the same love is going to do it because you've said that I can that's that's the way this this unconditional love works towards us it's more than just a good feeling it's actually a true true love for us I've just got these ones he talks about temptations you know when we go through things you need us go through things this way no I'll let you go through right and it's its purpose the purpose of this is to bring us into a place of of a sinless life right here if things were doing wrong he wants to get those out because we've seen you can the purpose of this love is to is to mold and make us the purpose of chastisement is to stop us from going this way and go this way the purpose of testings us maybe there's a wrong attitude in us and he says right I've got to put you through this to get rid of that attitude it might be four years and it might break us down but I love you it's unconditional love towards you it's a continuation of unconditional love towards you that in spite of your world I'm going to do whatever I want to do in your life because I love you and you've entrusted me you've entrusted to me with that to you give see God mold and shape me you've entrusted that's mean I'm not going to let you down right so I'm gonna do what's right for you even if you don't want it now this is why Paul says not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect perfect but I follow after that if then I may agree him that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus you understand what that means now what truly apprehended us was actually this great love apprehended us right that's what it pretended us now that's Christ but that's love it it consistently fought for us till it got us and apprehended us now Paul saying that thing I want to pretend that thing that I pretended me see and that's our as believers we want to every in Christ which is proof we want to take on this whole thing right when we accept Christ for our day I'm almost done I've got two more slides we accept the Holy Ghost which is perfect and unconditional love now this is this is now we say God is love and God is lighter that comes into us then that's exactly what we've got in our heart right that's what that's what we have by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one for the other I've got the scripture here I want to read and then I've got one more slide after that I know it's serious our quote from brother Brennan I am more convinced than ever in my life that it will take perfect love to enter their place this has been brother Brennan went beyond the curtain of time it was no jealousy no tiredness no sickness no old age no death only supreme beauty and joy whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love it to where you can love everybody even the enemy no matter if the plane is rocking the Lightning is flashing or the guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter perfect love now I'm going to close this brother Bell says I only saw perfect love there now don't forget we were pursued by perfect love and this perfect love every ended us now that's what we want to every end right this perfect perfect love now I have to make a statement then in light of this unconditional love towards God's children that if only perfect love can enter being God and as unconditional love towards us will continue to bring us to a place of perfect love he has - yes - and whether you go through this one life will that it's all for this purpose through that the love of God might be fully manifested in our hearts and then we would become a people filled with perfect love because that's what's redeemed us we might have pretend that thing which I met we ended off there's perfect love I don't know if this consequent goes a different way than just feelings and yet when you break down the love of God it's specific conditional for his unconditional love is conditional for his children right and if you're a recipient of it that's the most powerful force on earth and it will overtake you and then it will be so faithful to you that it will actually mold and make you and shape you into what it knows you should be in spite of you because it and regardless of what you do it loves you so much that it's just going to going to bring you up that's why the song we sing at the end was putting for the occasion grace grace God's grace when you look at it like this you realize it's actually God's grace that's been pursuing me from before I was born if I'm anything is because of his grace it's not because I suddenly was good guy it's by His grace and a fireman has graced in his his unmerited unconditional love as towards me and it's not going to stop us because none of his children are going to be lost and that's the if you believe it receive it right people walk it you know predestination I receive it Lord have that's the case then how could I possibly even be lost how could this love they're so powerful to be happy to how could I possibly ever be lost it's um this standest warning we're just pray anymore sing sing a song or two let's ask the musicians to come as Lord Jesus lord I just thank you Lord that
