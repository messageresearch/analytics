[0:01] [Music]
[0:15] I was sure by now, God, you would have
[0:19] reached down and wiped our tears away.
[0:25] Stepped in and saved the day.
[0:28] But once again,
[0:31] I'll say amen.
[0:34] And it's still raining.
[0:39] As the thunder rolls,
[0:42] I barely hear you whisper through the
[0:45] rain.
[0:47] I'm with you.
[0:51] And as your mercy falls,
[0:54] I'll raise my hands and praise the God
[0:57] who gives
[1:00] and takes away.
[1:05] I'll praise you in the storm
[1:09] and I will lift my hands
[1:12] for you are who you are.
[1:15] No matter where I am
[1:18] and every tear I cry
[1:21] that you hold in your hand.
[1:24] You've never left my side.
[1:28] And though my heart is to
[1:31] [Music]
[1:34] I will praise you in the storm.
[1:37] [Music]
[1:44] I remember when
[1:46] I stumbled in the wind.
[1:50] You heard my cry. You pick me up again.
[1:56] My strength is almost gone.
[1:59] I cannot carry on.
[2:02] if I can find you.
[2:07] As the thunder rolls,
[2:10] I barely hear you whisper through the
[2:13] rain.
[2:16] I'm with you.
[2:20] And as your mercy falls,
[2:23] I raise my hands and praise the God who
[2:26] gives
[2:29] and takes away.
[2:32] Oh,
[2:34] I'll praise you in the storm.
[2:38] And I will lift my hands
[2:41] for you are who you are.
[2:44] No matter where I am.
[2:47] And every tear I've cried
[2:50] that you hold in your hand.
[2:53] You never left my side.
[2:56] And though my heart is thrown,
[3:02] I'll praise you in the storm.
[3:12] I'll praise you in the storm.
[3:15] And I will lift my hands.
[3:18] Cuz you are who you are.
[3:21] No matter where I am.
[3:24] And every tear I cry
[3:28] that you hold in your hands.
[3:31] You never left my side.
[3:34] And though my heart is torn,
[3:40] I'll praise you in the storm.
[3:44] [Music]
[3:47] And though my heart is tall,
[3:53] I will praise you in the storm.
[3:57] [Music]
[4:02] [Applause]
