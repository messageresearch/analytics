hallelujah amen thank you brother isaac thank you musicians amen good morning everyone god bless you hallelujah in in my defense the old gizzy thing my my great grandfather happened just turn up first you know so that's why we're there and why anyway um praise the lord i always get cheeky when i talk about gizmo because organize the best surf places in the world so but then i haven't been there in over a decade so anyway one day we'll do a nostalgia tour but hey man praise the lord trust everyone's well today um we're just gonna go to i always have a joke with my wife she's from tauranga so you know anyway which beach is best anything um but i'm glad we're going to a land that is far beyond this one hallelujah amen this is just a shadow of uh it's a fallen world but we're going to a restored one amen let's go to uh joshua chapter 10 and then we're going to go to second kings 7. so we've got a joshua 10. amen great to have everyone here today amen so um oh i'm in judges that's gonna that works okay so joshua 10 and verse 8 see you see and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i've delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night and the lord discomforted uh then before israel and they slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goth up to betharan and smote them to asaka and unto mecca and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were in the going down to bethlehem that the lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto ezra and they died and there were more that which died with the hailstones then they whom the children of israel slew with the sword then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he saith in the sight of israel son stand now still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agelon and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies is the is not this written in the book of jasher for the son stood still in the midst of heaven and hated not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like it like that before it or after it that the lord hearken unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel he said how did that work i know but god did it okay i just believe it happened amen so we're gonna go to second kings and and seven i read from verse one so i'm trying to sort myself out here what have i done okay second kings and chapter seven we'll read verse one down to verse five it says here then elisha said hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine oil a fine flour sorry be sold for a shekel and two measures of valley for a shekel in the gate of samaria then a lord in whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold there shall thou shall see it with thine eyes pardon me but shall not eat thereof and there were four leprous men at the entering end of the gate and they said to one another why sit we here until we die if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come let us fall into the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live if they kill us we shall but die and they rose up in the twilight to go into the camp of the sirians and when they came to the uttermost part of the camp of syria behold there was no man there amen hallelujah let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer if you've got a need you want to just raise your hand before the lord let's pray together gracious heavenly father we are so thankful that thou art the same yesterday today and forever lord you are the true and living god you're alive upon the earth lord making your word to come to pass and i want to thank you lord for your precious blood that you shed that day on calvary i want to thank you that lord it still is powerful and real and alive as it was that day because your holy ghost which was in your blood is now upon the believer the lord i just pray i just want to get myself out of the way may you come and anoint speaker and hear her one more time father i pray you'd have preeminence in every life in this meeting lord may just take control for your glory we just want to commit our lives into your hands lord you see the hands that have been raised lord the needs behind those hands father i want to ask lord may you meet every need for your glory answer every question lord dissolve every doubt lord jesus because we know you're greater than every situation we face every dilemma father we thank you for your lord that you undertaken you are such a merciful loving god so to commit our lives into your hands lord we also want to remember lord those who couldn't make it today may be their portion father be their strength and shield lord today lord may your anointing fall upon them as they watch this service for your glory lord and we just want to ask lord may have your way once again in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning um i'd like to uh just talk go go into this a little bit about how you know we shouldn't let the enemy just linger we should get rid of him we should kick him out so here we are uh here we um we we read this uh account here and second kings will come back to joshua some other time in the in the service uh hopefully but you know here here are these leprous men here they're sitting by the gate we know you know if you read the whole account we didn't read it to save time but you know um samaria is besieged by the syrians and and there's a great famine in the city there's um you know that you know it even came to such a desperate point that they that they would be uh killing each other's children eating them just to survive and a head of a donkey cost some astronomical amount and a piece of pigeon dung was a crazy amount of money just your people trying to survive and but but there came a prophecy from elijah saying that this time tomorrow everything's going to be restored you know you know everything's going to be restored so when i talk about a restoration here i'm not talking about a a restoration of an economy because economies come they go they up they're down left and right but talk about the restoration of a people this is more important right so um here they are um sitting here and and you can see obviously they did not hear this prophecy because if they did they just would have said let's just wait till tomorrow we're going to get food things are going to be restored but they said well you know why do we sit here and die so why do we sit here in this state let's do something about it and so they would so they they made up their minds that sitting still wasn't the answer but they had to change where they were in order for things to change so they they decided let's go to the camp of the sirians remember the syrians were the enemy but they they just made up their minds well you know if we live we live if we die we die but we're going to die here anyway so let's do something about it so you know they you know and and what i love about it is that we are in a far better state than those lepers because they didn't know how they would be received there they could get killed they could live they don't know but you know we're not we're not invited to go to the camp of the enemy this morning but we're invited to go into the camp or the house of the father which is the presence of god himself now brother brown would say this in the message who is this melchizedek and we know melchizedek is jesus christ but he would he would come down to the end of the service and he would call out a a lady dying with cancer on a cot and he would say to her now one time there were three lepers at the gate of samaria and then lepers said why do we sit here till we die because of all the sickness starving to death eating one another's children they said if we go down to the enemies camp the sirians if they kill us we're going to die anyhow if they save us we'll live and they took that chance and and by that faith they not only saved their selves but the whole group now you're going to die if you lay there but if you're not asked but you're not asked to go to the camp of the enemy you're invited to the house of the father now you're dying with cancer you can't live outside of god you're not from the city you're not from around here you're you've come a long way you're from milwaukee that's true that's right i've seen the city i know it that's right do you believe will you accept god now as your healer if you will no matter how weak you are how big fast you are i believe in your case i would rise up in the name of jesus christ take that cod and go home and live to the glory of god he says will you obey me as god's prophet then rise up and go be well don't be scared get up off of that cot god will make you wealthy somebody hold her so she can get up and get strength do you believe god just let her get a little strength she'll be all right that's it sister there there she is in the name of the lord jesus stand up and give praise to god he's the same yesterday today and forever and if you listen to that you can hear just such an awe come over the crowd because she got up i mean and she went on her way so she see you know she was invited to go to the house of the father into the presence of god because she was going to die in that state but she had to take that little face she had you know don't be scared we can't be scared of stepping into the unknown you know our god is here to meet every need to to transform our lives but we're going to cast aside the fear of the unknown and step by faith into his presence so you know these lepers as i said we are in a far better condition than these lepers because they were there they they they didn't know how they would receive be would be received but we are living in a time where we have been shown by many infallible proofs that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen that he says that all that come to me i'll know why is cast out so if we go beyond where we are into his presence to get what we need amen we will be received i believe it hallelujah now in his presence is where healing abides it's where there is faith for all things amen those lepers just thought let's try and get some food from the syrians they might feed us or they'll kill us yet so yes they were going just on hope but they knew that they would get a clear cut and potentially they would get cut decision because they get cut they get killed but they they want to clear cut answer right either we'll get fed or we'll die but they want they didn't just want to linger and wonder what would happen one of the potential of going to the enemy's camp they decided we're going we're going to go and see unfortunately that's very different from many christians or people who instead of settling in their hearts that they're going to go and get an answer from god and really get an answer that then what happens is they start off half-heartedly and the first thing a problem comes up and they quit and they say the promise doesn't work i say i'm i'm standing here this morning saying every promise of god is true it's for the believer it's available by the blood of jesus christ i mean he's opened a way that we can receive every divine promise of god i mean it can be in our possession this morning you know to me it's like if the lepers what if they just went halfway to the syrian camp maybe they stubbed their toes they got tired they got discouraged and they stopped there or they just turned around you know imagine if it's it was like this just to dramatize you know that there was another guy sitting by the gate he decided not to go and these lepers went and then he saw them coming back and they just looked discouraged and he said you know what happened when you got there you know did you you know did you get any food have you some you know do you have some left over they'd say no you know it didn't work we got tired and we turned around there was nothing to get there and it and then maybe he'd ask why is that did you turn around with nothing no if they were truthful they you know did you get nothing no if they were truthful they just say actually the journey got too rough and we quit before we got there we don't want to be in that kind of condition with the promises of god where just because it doesn't work then it's not true it is true amen you know that's the way it is if people are seeking an answer from god about something and they say the promise isn't true is what happens is they've started the journey but they don't arrive into his presence see the reason that they don't arrive into his presence is because they don't go with the whole heart seeking god they are either a bit indifferent or they have their mind made up already is how god will answer their prayer i mean the thing is i'm not worried about how god will answer me i just want an answer hallelujah you know i haven't got my answer made up before i pray then i pray expecting this answer no however is that and no is as good as a yes and you know he answers many different ways as long as he answers i'm happy amen jeremiah would say that when they call upon me i shall go on uh and ye shall go and pray unto me i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search me with all your heart i mean to have a promise in the scripture if you seek after him you shall find him if you seek with all your heart hallelujah he says in hebrews 11 and 6 but without faith is impossible to please him for he that cometh a god must believe that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him see the lepers were in this kind of condition they wanted an answer they weren't just willing to go half the way and say well this is not just going to work i'm going to quit other you know there was nothing there for us now they went all the way to the syrian camp and they found it empty and they fed themselves and you know then they went and told the whole city they delivered the whole place because there's a prophet prophecy of a restoration see something has to happen when you seek the lord with all your heart something has to happen i believe something's got to change you know you have to arrive you don't just oh there's a journey and i'm no no it's not about the journey it's about the destination and many times that destination it takes you just for you go from standing up to on your knees and then be in prayer amen but you have to arrive if you've made up your mind lord i'm gonna go anyway even if you think well he might not answer i'm going i'm going into this camp i'm going into his presence i'm gonna i'm gonna get a hold of his garment by faith i want an answer i'm not just a wishy-washy well maybe it'll work no it'll work amen you have to arrive if you go with all your heart you're determined lord i want to i want an answer from you i believe you will get an answer hallelujah you know i remember the first birthday present that christian ever gave me was a ride in an ambulance we just got back from our honeymoon in papua new guinea we had a tremendous time there uh we were with the half time we had a honeymoon half time we're doing a mission trip there with the believers in the village here that eventually they came into the message they um but you know to me it was amazing because christine just got and got in the kitchen you know helped out did everything and you know they would say so so they are the people of tolai it's their tribe and that's like she's a real tolaimiri you know a real terlai woman as a but to me it was the life of christ on display and um they they were really trying to fatten us up you know they said good you're putting on weight and it's you know um 60 years ago that'd be a bit scary because that was cannibal country even in about world war ii era they were still doing that kind of thing but we're still here with all our limbs and we still can't attend but you know but they love to feed us and you know but anyway we had a great time but what happened is when we came back and we don't know what it was the cause but she she started having seizures and uh she'd be unresponsive so she had normal strong healthy then then but then after the trip she started having these seizures where she go unresponsive and i think it was her left or right side would just start shaking and it should come out of it be normal and just go in and out of this so that's what caused the um that's what caused the ambulance ride on your birthday and uh but you know it was such a strange thing to watch your new bride growing like going through this and um yeah yeah i didn't know what was going on and so the doctors when when when she got taken into hospital they did all these different cognitive tests and tried to work out if it was a stroke or clots or whatever but but it no nothing fit the pattern and um of course now here i am i'm like the lepers by the gate i can't just sit here and watch this go seek i i appreciate medical science i work in the science field okay so i'm not anti-medicine praise the lord for medicine but you know god answers many different ways but but why do we have to just let the devil run his course why can't we just kick him out instead of putting up with something see we have a privilege and i'll get to it we have a privilege to enforce upon satan our rights where we have that privilege amen so you know and you know it was funny because the last thing that they tested her with i'm jumping back but you know she had an mri scan on her brain so medically medically only one of us has been proven to have a sound mind and it's not me but um anyway so so she having these seizures different things and you know so but i i knew i had to get an answer it wasn't enough just to thank the lord for the doctors but it wasn't just enough to get a diagnosis then get a treatment no no god's a healer we've seen him heal too much before this so why just put up with the devil's nonsense i mean so but i knew i had to get an answer now the scripture yeah and then even i thought to myself this could be a long trial but why does it have to be we know god's in control of all things but why does it have to be a long trial why can't it end right now because remember the scripture says jesus said him that asketh receiveth him that seeketh findeth him that knocketh it shall be opened so knocketh is not just you know that's lord open the door open the door lord hymn that seeketh your you're diligently seeking and you know the lord gave us a promise that upon this rock the revelation of who jesus christ is i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail and we know a gate stops an entrance i mean so there's got to be a i trust there's a bit of you know a bit of grit in you and i that if the devil puts a door in your way you're going to bash it down it may take a few rams but it's going to go it's going to burst open amen it's going to burst open in prayer so i think it was the second i think it was the second day i can't remember which day it was but anyway these seizures were getting closer together and worse so they get so i was getting worse but then there was one afternoon i was just in prayer i was like lord i gotta bust this door open i need an answer hallelujah and then i because why because there's a divine promise by his stripes we are healed it's not this wasn't what's the will what's your will for the situation god no he's already given in his word by his stripes my wife is healed hallelujah so you know i just was knocking in the door in prayer and desperation and i got through the door i don't know i can't describe the feeling but you know when you get that you know when you get an answer it's open go through it's there hallelujah it's not just that well i think i feel happy and i think no no you know there's something in your heart anchors you've got the answer i mean to the next i think it was the next day i came in um you know and then she began to describe how these seizures were going and you know they were getting worse and closer together and she said before uh it would come on her she said she felt like that feeling when you're like standing on the edge of a cliff you're about to be pushed or jumped and then a dark cloud will come upon her then it would happen and she could hear everything but she was totally unresponsive and then she said that that that dark cloud is going to come on me again it's coming on so he prayed and rebuked it and it left and that was the end of it hallelujah i think it was that day or the next day she was discharged hallelujah so why sit here if we sit here sir if i just sat there and said well i guess this is just how it's going to be no god god god interrupts the devil's plans he cancels the devil's plans the devil has one plan god has another i'd say lord i want to live according to your plan not according to the devil's plan hallelujah so yeah and i think i think she was actually waiting for the mri i think that was the last thing she had but yeah as i said medically proven sound brain this one is still a question mark anyway but he's the same god this morning he's the same god this morning amen it says in hebrews 4 and 16 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of need so we can by the blood of jesus christ we can come boldly before his throne we don't have to be afraid we don't have to be timid about it because he has given us an entrance to press in and get an answer hallelujah amen so don't quit halfway be like the lepers and go all the way into the camp and find out that every promise in his word is true hallelujah more than a good fridge magnet or an instagram post but a living reality amen his word is a living reality and remember we are not called we're not going to the enemies camp amen that we might receive food or death but we're going to father's house with his joy unspeakable full of glory a peace that passes all understanding a rest that is eternal a hidden manner that will never go off it will feed your soul amen there's a god that answers prayer there's healing there's deliverance there's comfort i mean there's there's wisdom there's guidance everything we have need of is in his presence hallelujah amen see there's a law who's ever jumped in a river or a lake or or the ocean and not got wet no one eh in the history of you know there's a law you go out when it rains you get wet yep if you go out where it's blowing your wind is blowing you feel the wind our god is a supernatural god if you get into his presence that's where the supernatural happens because he's supernatural and if you ever get in contact with that god that lord jesus amen the supernatural takes place hey you can't stop it from happening it has to happen it's just like you jump we go jump in the hut river i'll guarantee you hundred percent of you'll get wet you know it's it sounds ridiculous but it is that true you know it's the same thing with god it says the mighty man of valor could refer back to the old word and know it's right because he he know this that god is a supernatural being and wherever a supernatural being is he'll do supernatural signs because his supernatural is in him you can't get out of it hallelujah how can you stand in the face of the wind without the wind blowing how can you get in the water without it being wet water is wet that's the chemical of it it's wet and when you get in water you're going to get wet right and when you get the prince of god the supernatural there's going to be supernatural signs and supernatural working of a supernatural god hallelujah he says where a supernatural god is there's a there are going to be supernatural things happening you just can't keep from it it's got to be that way you can't help it because he's a supernatural god it has to be that way now we are living in a time where god is very present the world is falling apart but god is upon the earth as spirits here ensuring that whosoever will will get into the ark of safety which is christ amen and we know that our lives are in his hands so that you know unfortunately we are living in pre-tribulation times but that's just the season we're in but even in this time of a great shaking of this world everything's collapsing i mean we have a sure foundation i mean we don't just have to sit by the gate and watch the world fall apart we can go to the house of the father amen we go into the camp of our god amen and get what we have need of now i want you know i'm so thankful that when you know the name of our lord jesus christ is the name above every name hallelujah amen sickness had to obey him when he was standing upon the earth we know the greatest name you know god revealing himself is in the name of jesus christ he revealed himself as jehovah el shaddai adonai different names but when he came down to finally the greatest manifestation of of his being was he was called jesus christ which is jehovah's salvation is manifested so we know when he was upon earth i mean sickness couldn't stand before him amen you know epileptic spirits couldn't stand before him amen the devil got into the sea of galilee one day when he was asleep on the boat and ten thousand devils swore they'd drown him they had him they thought in a weak spot i remember when the disciples finally woke him up he just stood up and said peace be still and the winds and waves obey him because he created the winds and the waves hallelujah amen legion who is full of thousands of devils amen those devils had to leave him i mean they had to bow to the name of jesus christ i mean lazarus that was four days in the tomb rotten already his body was decayed amen corruption had to know its master and death had to give i mean one back to life again because it had to bow to the name of jesus christ everything must give way to that name there is not one thing that can stop that name manifesting hallelujah even hell itself satan couldn't stop it amen hell couldn't keep him holy the tomb couldn't keep him they had to give way amen to the name of the lord jesus christ he says in philippians 2 9 whereof god hath also highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of the father so his name is above all names hallelujah we've seen many things bowed of that name amen a prophet was told in this generation and and he was the one who brought it up because he because the angel told him that if you're sincere get the people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayers and he said not even cancer and the angel said not even cancer because the cancer was the major killer in the day still is but it was shown god was showing the power of the blood saying nothing can stand before the believer's prayer you take the biggest devil the biggest thing that people fear nothing will stand before it amen if there's the prayer of faith god will answer that prayer and everything must bow before that name we've seen sickness has to bow whatever that spirit was that sickness yeah when my wife was in hospital that had to bow that had to go in the name of jesus christ hallelujah you know you know fear is such a crippler you know before our gabriella was born so we're up in auckland at christmas time she was born 31st of january but but around that time when we're up in auckland christine had this um a dream where gabriella was stillborn and when she woke up there's such a fair in the room and so she she told me about it and i said i just refuse that flat i'm not accepting this and and so we come we know when it comes to mothers giving birth you know if you want a real smooth smooth birth it's got to be a relaxing atmosphere you can't have a lot of tension and things and so anyway we're driving it comes to the day of you know so we're praying about it between the time that she had the dream and when we're going so anyway we're driving to the hospital and so you know we pray as we're going and so we prayed against the dream and then uh but then christine said can i pray again and she prayed and she totally forgot about it but then it's still in the back of my mind so here we are you know and then everything's going fine but then but then um gabriella's shoulder got stuck as she was coming out so they pushed the emergency bell on every doctor and the nurse and everyone in the hospital turned up in the room and anyway the midwife turned the shoulder and you know she came out because i think it's within four minutes that a baby's got to get out and start breathing otherwise brain damage comes in thankfully it was well within that time she was out and her face was all blue you know and then and she wasn't even screaming or kicking when she came out she was blue totally blue and they put her down and so i'm praying you know because this dream is still the devil's saying i'm going to kill your child she's going to be born still i said no god don't let this happen and then so gabriella comes out her face is all bruised because of how she came out but then her whole body's blue and they put her down on the you know that table they have with the lamp and they inspect the bones and everything and then she starts breathing and and i watch it it's like pink spread through her body hallelujah and she was totally fine now i didn't realize at the time but christine told me afterwards that when she prayed again when we were in the cast she totally forgot about that dream hallelujah but why do we have to accept the devil gives you something he projects a future to you this is how it's going to be now do we sign for that and accept it see what if i said well i guess honey we've just got to accept it you know what no we don't have to what what if christine accepted that dream well i guess she's just going to be stillborn who said amen amen our god is here amen to undertake so we don't need to listen to what the devil will say amen but it depends what we yeah see if we sit he gives us something like that it's like the lep is sitting in the gate are we going to sit here and accept this we're going to die something bad no we might as well go to the camp we must leave where we are go to the presence of god and get our answer is everyone okay today right if i'm fine you know we don't we we serve a prayer answering god hallelujah so everything must bow to the name of jesus christ it would say in hebrews 1 1 god who at sundered times in diverse manners i mean spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed air of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being in the brightness of his glory in the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins and sat down at the right hand the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath made he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to them a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the uh he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all angels of of god worship him and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire so the scripture says here that he is tamed obtained he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than the angels see every angel must obey the name of the lord jesus christ even fired angels we know the devil was the anointed cherub that covereth but then he exalted himself in pride wanted to make a better kingdom there in heaven than you than michael and so he got fired and now he's a fallen angel and all the ones that believed his lies amen they were they were kicked out of heaven as well and now they've become demons right but they originally started as angels but now they have they have been cast out and now they're fighting against the people of god but our lord jesus has obtained a greater inheritance than them a more excellent name than them right so by the name of jesus christ they have to obey right this may be very elementary but i just want you to you know i trust it'll just strengthen our faith we don't have to put up with what the devil is doing amen jesus would say after his resurrection that all powers get on given unto me in heaven and on earth and then he would he would give that power or give the authority of that power to his disciples and that same authority is now given to us it's like a police officer you can take the smallest person in the world but if they become a police officer they have all of the city's authority behind them you know in their own strength they couldn't stop a they couldn't stop a child you know they could certainly couldn't stop a big truck coming down the road but as soon as they got that badge on and they go out there and they hold up their hand it doesn't matter how many wheel how many ton are in that truck it's got to stop because the authority on that policeman you know friends we're more than policemen i mean we are the children of the most high god amen so it's not just the state behind us all of heaven amen is here to back up the believer hallelujah why because that authority amen has been given to us not to use it as we would in our own ability but be surrendered to god that he will use it when he wants to see fit amen that's the most important thing you know we are not like people try and make superheroes that they just do what they want no no we're surrendered amen it's not our will but it's his will is done hallelujah amen now the apostle paul would tell us sorry for this reading here but i'm but but i want to come to something that he says he says that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may be given unto you the spirit may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to war toward uh to us lord sorry who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at the right hand in heavenly places far abrov uh far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so he's been placed now far above all principality and power so it doesn't matter how big now we're talking when we're talking about principality and powers we're talking about demon powers in high places right the battle we fight is not against flesh and blood right it's against demon power spiritual wickedness in high places amen but he says that he's been placed far above all those things and he has dominion over those things and every name that is named not only in this world but that which is to come and has put all things under his feet now we're gonna ask the question where are his feet today right because we are we just read that the church is his body right the church is his body i mean so if the church is his body and all these things are under his feet they're all under us hallelujah anything the devil will throw against us is actually beneath us amen and if it tries to take control of us or is actually causing us trouble amen it's out of its position hallelujah are you gonna tell it where to go in the name of jesus christ amen now what i love about it is it's not anything that we have a we could obtain in our own strength but we have become by his supreme grace if we are children amen then we're ears ears of god and joint is with christ amen so if that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so this word joint ear it's one who obtains something i mean as a joint participant so if we're a joint here everything he fell here too by his grace we we feel heir to it too remember he's the one that's conquered he conquered hell he conquered death he conquered the grave he conquered every spirit that could be named every trouble that we face is already conquered i mean so he's already conquered everything but amen because we're joint ears we fall here to his victory hallelujah amen now what i love about this is that we have a privilege now so so we have rights the christian has rights and god i'm not talking about national rights and you know what i'm not talking about i'm talking about rights in jesus christ which to me are far above i mean just just natural natural rights so we have the privilege because we have rights of because of who we are because of the blood of jesus christ then we have we have the privilege to enforce upon satan the claims that god give us and for god hath the law and his word is a law and god in his word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon satan and say give it back and he has to do it because we take god's agent the holy spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the lord he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it i mean the law of the land is to enforce it's by it's by the land for the land i mean but the holy ghost is here to enforce aiming in our lives our privileges upon satan now what is that basically if satan says you'll never overcome that's your living and and you're in a mind battle with it and you're wrestling with him that means is actually he's dragging you down below your privilege because you are an overcomer you are victorious right remember the devil's meant to be beneath us sure we can't stop thoughts coming into our mind but what we do with it is very different thing amen or if we're sick and the devil says we'll never get well who said he doesn't know the future we know the future god knows the future right but we don't have to live under any form of defeat we have the privilege say satan know you have no right to hold us down in this defeat i'm victorious because jesus christ has made me victorious amen amen if we have a privilege then why not use it if we if we don't have the i mean if we have the privilege then why not use it it's our right it's our benefit that we draw from the power of his blood amen why do we allow the enemy any room at all like some little spirit working like a little fussing or a little contention you know why do we let that just linger that's like the lepers at the gate just sitting there why are we staying like this let's let's go get an answer amen don't let the threat to the enemy and or what he's doing linger any longer hallelujah we see fear can us but we don't have to put up with it it's not our portion to be afraid i mean god's god said to us no you'll have a power love and a sound mind we we don't have to put up with fear i mean because fear has never helped anyone fear just disables people's lives in the world as christians wherever it's just fear cripples people we don't have to live in fear we are called to live in faith it's our god-given right and privilege to walk a walk of faith and not have fear amen don't let fear plague you we see the only communication we have between us and the devil is us commanding him to get back give us back our rightful property and leave in the name of jesus christ that should be the only communication with you and satan and we shouldn't put up with the conversation we have with him in our mind and we say no satan that's not my right that's not my portion god has given me all things in jesus christ i made more than a conqueror i mean his blood is more than enough i mean it's fully atoned for my sin i don't have to earn anything he earned all that down calvary for me he's my sacrifice he's my perfect lamb hallelujah we have to put up with him you think about the property we have healing is our property right total deliverance is our property joy is our property peace is our property perfect love is our property forgiveness is our property i mean rest for our souls is our property i mean prodigal's returning home is our property amen the holy ghost is ours to have that's our god-given right amen it's our god-given right to be healed it's our god-given right to be set free it's our god-given right to be delivered amen it's our god-given right to have the original faith of the book of acts i mean the genuine holy spirit ministering through each of us as to how the lord sees it fit to do that's our god-given right that's a privilege we're actually he's given us to live in that kind of fashion you know a believer can never live above their privilege amen because we have all things you know it's not like now we're down here and god's up here and we can't no no where joint is in the old testament under the law the woman in israel were like second-class citizens but because if you look at the temple the woman can only come a certain distance towards the holy of holies first it was the court of the gentiles they could come a certain area but they couldn't come further then it was the court of the woman they could come closer but they couldn't you know they come further than the gentiles but they couldn't that's as far as they go then there's the court of the men then there was the priests and everything they were seeing class citizens under the law but under the blood of jesus christ the apostle peter says that we are joint heirs together hallelujah so we are not now i'm not just talking about natural women now i'm talking about the church we're not seeing class citizens in the economy of god but by the blood of jesus christ he's lifted us up to be joint heirs with him amen hallelujah amen so we can't live above our privilege hallelujah amen trust that came out okay but you see you know none of us are second class citizen either naturally or spiritually amen now these these are not just empty claims right empty words that never come to pass we have seen these things happen amen amen we have seen many many healings i just ran these things down last night we've seen many many healings have we not who's been touched by god and know god's healed them right we've seen many many healings but people say well healing is just the children's bread well i don't know about you but i like bread with my meal i like a real good meal with brett i'm not going to throw out part of the feast i'm going to have i'm going to have the whole thing amen and then if we how can you remember the body change is actually one big divine healing it's not a temporal temporal healing it's a whole healing complete healing right that our bodies have transformed from from this to an immortal body amen so it's all in the atonement just the same blood that jesus shed to purchase our salvation is the same blood he shared to heal our bodies and heal our spirits amen you know i was thinking about the camps we've had and what the lord has done you know it's our right because of what god has done for him to live among us that's what he wanted to do his whole purpose of dying on calvary is that he would live in people that's what he wanted that's what he's always wanted he says heaven is my throne the earth is my foot stolen isaiah he says where's the place of my rest you know so he says i made these galaxies you look up you know you go to somewhere you can actually see more than about 12 stars you've got to go out from the suburbia and you know you see the milky way and everything he says i made that that's my throne this earth you're standing was my footstool but where's the place of my rest i want a place of rest and the bible says that the human soul is the place of his rest so he's calling out it's like i made all these things but where's the place of my rest and we can say lord here i am here i am hallelujah so that's what he was he's always wanted by us thinking you know i think about brother corbin i think it was the second camp we ever had you had a real touch with god there brother tim dodd's you know there's just in the back where he normally stands at cam and god just came down and changed his life you know that all started because sister vanessa had a real breakthrough in prayer one wednesday night when we had a prayer meeting who was there those early days oh boy hallelujah but you know what was amazing with that is she went home sorry if i take this for me taking this liberty she went home and brother cabin who wasn't coming to church's time said you know no you're not going on sunday i'm gonna pick where we're gonna go i think it was a month later he said okay we're getting in the car and they got in the car and they came straight to church where we had it there at parkside road and he's been here ever since praise the lord i mean but that at camp all started because someone decided i can't sit here at the gate i can't sit here i you know if i stay here we're all gonna die i need the salvation of my husband so she went into the house of the father hallelujah and the and and the answer came hallelujah i remember sister shannon was there that that uh was that praying but she cried out where's the god of elijah hallelujah and then isaac had that experience you know where he laid it all down he wrote that song oh sweet jesus take my life all my you know all my strivings all that strife you're the only thing i've ever done that's right amen he saw the pillow fire sorry what do you say you saw you saw yourself in him and then the lord said you just got the holy ghost and what was amazing about that is he didn't say it happened but then the next week i think i saw him and he looked different and and me and christine said isaac looks different something's happened to him hallelujah what is that going beyond going into the camp of the father to get what you need hallelujah you know we've had people come to camp and they and you know they said lord if you don't become real in this you got to prove this message is real at this camp and if you don't i'm gonna quit and god revealed it supernaturally to them and they're still believers to this day hallelujah transform them supernaturally i mean we've had many many things like that happen you know what i love also about the um you know well one i very much love that gabrielle is healthy strong and well but at that time we know that the um little liam where's where's liam shurik he's there you know at that time he was having all these welts and things come out on his body and this you know i know you know these testimonies but but i just want to let's just raise some faith our god still lives holy our god still lives and so the doctors gave them creams different things couldn't get any answer but when i stood up and testified that we did not accept this brother our man said i do not accept this either why should we put up with what the yo the devil says and so they prayed and tried to come back once and then it went hey gone gone to this day why we don't have to oh it's a virus or whatever sure it is but we don't have to put up with it why put up with the devil's works we can cast them out where we find them amen hallelujah you know i was telling the last time i was in papua new guinea i was telling the believers i mean that this message takes us back to a true day of pentecost experience amen and in that meeting when i was preaching the interpreters stopped for three or four minutes because everyone understood in their own language and i saw hardened men like these are mountain men man i wish i could describe them amazing believers but you know they live up in the mountains in papua new guinea where it snows and you know they said you know with their young people we take them up the mountain we train them they train but people that don't show any emotion weeping over the pulpit trying to close the service because god had just moved like that see it's not just an empty claim god comes and says that's true hallelujah because he wants us to see this the promises of god are not just empty promises they're not just a nice idea or something to tickle our you know just just give us some empty false hope it's not that this word is true this word will produce what it says it will produce i mean it will produce a rapture it will give you deliverance amen if you go to the camp of the father i mean it will give you peace it will give you joy you know don't just try jesus get a hold of jesus you know don't just try you know somebody said well i'll just try jesus don't just try him go get a hold of him hallelujah you really get a hold of him i mean your life will never be the same and i'm a testimony of that the drunken lost university student and god found me but i was looking for him something said i'm sick of this life you know i may have all these friends and great times but i just it just produced depression and emptiness in my life i thought you know and i started i found the message on the internet and i just started listening to brother brennaman he'd preach about why so many people fail to keep the victory and you know redemption and completeness and enjoy you had to be completely redeemed in the joy of it i thought i don't know what that is i always believed jesus was god but i had no idea but then that caused it hunger to come forth i and i i was so simple in my mind i thought well if jesus if the tomb is empty and he's alive forevermore i can meet that one hallelujah and i did i say rather he met me and changed my life forever amen now we'll come to joshua really quickly joshua was determined he was focused they had to defeat this enemy they couldn't let him linger they could because he knew when the sun goes down they could hide and they could rally together and fight again the next day he wanted it settled then and there and that's why he stood there under inspiration and he told the sun and the moon to stand still and they were there for a whole day i don't know how that worked but you know i work in the science field but i'm not too worried about the details if god said it i believe it if he said if you repent be baptized name the lord jesus christ remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost i don't know the details i just believed it and it happened hallelujah lay hands on the second show you know and they shall recover i don't know the details i just believe it and it happens hallelujah amen so because he was determined that these enemies would not linger now we want to be in the same kind of mode right don't just get a small victory get a complete victory don't just don't just give the devil a lick and just knock him out hallelujah knock him out of the ring brother bam says in paradox he says now one day in the heat of battle when the kings had made a great covenant among themselves and had come down against joshua and the children of israel that god had promised in the land and he had routed the enemy and they were in the woods and hills scattered out through the wilderness there and joshua looked and he seen the sun going down he knew if those armies got a chance to replace themselves and come back again why he knows he'd have a twice as hard a time and probably lose more men if they ever got a place to unite themselves together now this is where ministers this is where we fail this is where the church fails when this revival we've just had this great campaigns across the country when we've had the enemy running we should keep him on the run but the thing of it is we have to go off on tantrums and so forth amen and big sprees of buildings making more for our groups and so forth and there you come and separating themselves from the word and taking this and that and then building up some great big organization and starting something else that's the way it always goes that's the way it is it was in the days of luther wesley moody sankey finney knox and calvert all the way down it's been the same way they get their eyes off the revival and get on to what they can do for themselves but you know what happened joshua wasn't that type of a man he needed time the sun was going down he knowed if the enemy ever built up the revivals almost at the end of the close of it like we stand today he knew if he ever waited till the enemy got fortified against him it would be hard to win that battle you know what he did he know that god promised that land he needed more time so the sun was about to go down then he said sun stands still i mean a paradox indeed and that sun stood there for a full day never moved and the moon over echelon never moved also because the bible said here it was never a time before a sense like that that god hearkened to the voice of a man you say oh if we had just lived in that day jesus said in mark 11 24 if you say to this mountain be moved into a doubt in your heart but believe what you've said will come to pass and you can have what you've said still grace and the paradox on down through into our age sure that moon and sun stood still until joshua fought his way through with israel and avenged themselves upon the enemy why it was in the line of duty i mean so we don't want to be we don't want to just get the enemy off on the run and then go off on a tantrum amen oh brother so and so did this sister so-and-so do this this is wrong here and you just go we don't want to go off on that kind of a tantrum no the enemy's on the run i mean let's let's make him sweat and stress a bit more and chase him a bit further amen let's keep him on the run that's what we're going to do i mean until we have possessed every divine promise hallelujah joshua was focused his goal was total annihilation of his enemy i mean because the enemy had no right to live there now i'm talking about spiritual enemies now right so the devil will encamp upon the promises of god and say it's not for you we don't just want to chase them off a part of the promise we want to chase them off every divine promise hallelujah you know we take that scripture mark 11 24 if you stand to this mountain you know i don't need physical mountains to move right i don't i don't need to move the haywards hill so it's flat so i can drive to work and it's an easier straight run i don't need that kind of thing but there's mountains there's things the devils placed and tries to make them look so big we have a right by the authority of god to tell that thing to move in the name of jesus christ i mean we are called to believe for the impossible and it may be things in our family traits that have passed down we just think there's no way we can overcome this yes we can yes we can i mean there has to come a time where it comes to an end why don't why why don't let it end in you why don't you be the one with that trait of maybe stubbornness or indifference or unforgiveness or anger or whatever it is last when it was just passed down through the family it's got to stop somewhere why not stop right here hallelujah what's impossible no it's not with god all things are possible amen and it is our right and privileged to believe for the impossible amen because when the lord steps on the scene impossibilities become possible hallelujah amen if satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of god you have a right this morning by the holy spirit to enforce the claim of god and say give them back amen if he's afflicted you and made you sick you have were right before god to enforce the laws of god by his stripes we're healed amen bring him back turn him loose we are taking him you're taking him out yonder of death we claim him bring him back now that's the enforcement restore it back to his natural condition again a man is sick a baby is sick a woman is sexy throughout their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim it's it's our claim because god gave it to us by his stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgressions were the stripes we were healed now we have a right to enforce that law and the law giver the holy spirit himself is here the ancient agent of god to see that it's done that way amen that's the only way he can work is when you let him work see you've got to believe that there's a law oh if i could ever he says if i ever get to my text there's a law there's a law given amongst everything hallelujah so we can either sit like the lepers did before they went to the enemy's camp and just let life continue on or we can go and we're not called to go to the camp of the enemy but we can go into the presence of god and get what we have need of if it's salvation if it's deliverance if it's healing if it's salvation of a loved one whatever it is you know whatever it is you can go into the presence of god i believe and you can get your answer and you can go go away rejoicing knowing god is here and he's met your need and the answer is on its way hallelujah but it all depends what to you yeah i mean i mean it all it all depends about what you want to do as for me i don't want to sit here you know if you keep doing the same things you get the same results right i mean that's insanity i can't remember who said it maybe einstein i'm not sure but insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result we can't like the lep is saying we just can't sit here we're going to do something different what about you and i what what mountain are you facing in your life amen you can you can meet god i believe he's here to meet every need i mean let's just stand to our feet this morning where the musicians please amen i mean let's sing that song winds of winds of faith wings of faith amen amen there are two roads you may take one by sight one by faith i take the word of god or what you see you know brother brown was asked a question or he said rather
