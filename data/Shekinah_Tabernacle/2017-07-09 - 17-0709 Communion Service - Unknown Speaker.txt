their portion too father amen I mean I mean thank you musicians I mean God bless you everyone I mean what a reason to live Hallelujah I mean let's just go to Romans chapter 5. and then we're going to go to um we're gonna go to Peter uh First Peter chapter one so Romans 5 and let's just read let's just read from verse 5. and Hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we were yet without strength and Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely for for scarcely or a righteous man will one die yet pre-adventure a good man should uh some would even dare to die but God commanded commandeth his love towards us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from the Wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we are saved by his life not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have received the atonement amen and then Peter first Peter and chapter one verse 8. whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls amen may the Lord bless his word tonight you may have seats I want to um just take a a short time to speak about speak about our Lord before we go to uh have communion and the Lord's supper and no we understand it's an incredible thing where God would move upon a heart and to see because the whole Christian walk and journey personally in a family and in a church your body it's all it's governed by Divine love it is not governed by fear it is not governed by pressure it is governed true Christianity is governed by Divine love and we read there in Romans 5 and 5 because you know our hope maketh not you know we're not ashamed because of the whole because the love of God which is shared about our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us and I was thinking this afternoon what an incredible thing where you you take the life of say the Apostle Paul or any of the any of the Believers where there came a time in their life where they did not know where they would end up on this natural natural walk the Apostle Paul I don't know necessarily if he knew he had to give his life you know if he knew he'd be in prison if he knew he'd be beheaded for the cause of Christ but yet there was something in them and I believe would be the same thing with us if we knew what we would have to face every day if we knew the tribulation we'd have to go through the Dark Places the hard times the struggles of life you know if if that was laid out before us I believe the believer would say yes Lord I will go through it because I love you I mean because of divine love we are constrained by Divine love amen that it wouldn't matter how bad things get how dark it can seem yet Divine love drives us through amen I don't say it pushes you through but it leads you through I should say Amen you take and maybe this is probably a bigger thing but you take Saul and you know King Saul and King David King Saul was man's choice he was you know he was Head and Shoulders Above the Rest he looked like a king but he was man's Choice he was not God's choice and because he was man's Choice he operated by fear even though he is Anointed by the same Prophet that David was anointed by the spirit of God was with him the same as David was but he was not God's choice and because he governed because he had the complexes in his life of being from the smallest family in the smallest tribe and all these insecurities he governed the church Israel was a church he gathered the church by fear and intimidation remember the first time he he called Israel to battle he took an ox and he divided it and he sent it to the four corners of the of you know of the country saying you'll be like this if you don't come and fight so he he was motivated the People by fear but when David when David was King when David was anointed king he led his people very differently the people I believe that gather themselves that David loved David they actually love them because as brother Brandon would would bring out in in um in various sermons about how how the smallest desire that David had became the greatest commandment to his mighty men how he longed for a drink from The Well of Bethlehem and he just he didn't say go get me a drink he said if only I could taste the Waters of The Well of Bethlehem and because they loved him I believe because they loved him it became a great commandment to them and they risked their own lives they had to cut their way through the Philistine garrisons and all those things in order to get the drink for him so to me it was divine it was love I mean he governed his whole Kingdom This Is Me Now by love not by intimidation or by fear because remember geez remember David was a type of Christ amen so now that's just a shadow now here comes into the reality now we as I said about the you know about Paul or any of the Apostles or any of the Believers down through they would have gladly if they knew I believe because of divine love their life was led by Divine love they would have gladly been eaten by the Lions that would have been rejoicing I mean they would have they would have said yes Lord you know many of the martyrs you go read Fox's book of Martyrs they embraced their stake that they're going to get burnt at some of them requested not even to be tied to it they rejoiced amen because Divine love amen well it's not this this Chris real Christianity is not just something you join up to real Christianity is when the one who the king who came and died for you comes and lives in your life and then he doesn't lead you by fear you know I'm not a Christian because I'm scared of hell I'm not a scared of I'm not a Christian because I'm scared of being in the tribulation being left behind I am a Christian because of divine love Amen in my whole life and it should be the same thing with our families amen or church or whatever individually our entire walk how we administer how we administer this amen the message of the hour how we administer it must be by Divine love it must be administered by Divine love being a head of a house you must administer you know how you how you treat your family must be by Divine love I mean there they walk with God staying close as a family should be governed by Divine love remember Divine love does not vary based on circumstance like human love you can you can be nice to me one day and I love you you're mean to me the other day I probably won't love you that's human love but Divine love goes beyond that Divine love is beyond circumstance amen is the same thing with the believer now it doesn't matter if things are good or things are bad if Divine love is and broaden your heart by the Holy Ghost you love me anyway I mean so that's why it goes beyond you know how's your natural life going it doesn't really matter how natural life is going how's your walk with the Lord going amen because we are called we are led by Divine love it is more than just an idea it is more than just a Doctrine it must be a reality amen because the very Heart Of God was manifested in Jesus Christ amen and he gave himself for us Hallelujah he gave himself for us he shed his life out you know while we are yet enemies outside of the Commonwealth of Israel outside of the promise he died for us I mean it was divine love that took him to the took him to the cross the reason when the Roman soldier put the spear in his side and blood and water separated and came out of his body as two separate things is because he died of a broken heart because here was the heart of God coming to the Earth here was the heart of God being rejected they didn't know in the Old Testament really they knew who Jehovah was but he was a separate kind of God so I'm off somewhere but here he comes flesh here comes the heart of God and they took the heart of God put him on an altar put him on a cross and rejected him he came to his own but his own received him not but as many as received him gave him power to become the sons of God Amen Hallelujah even though even as many as believe on his name so this whole walk must be motivated by love amen if you let's go to I want to go to I think Hebrews chapter 2. so scripture comes to mind yes here it is I love the book of Hebrews I love God I love his delivering power I believe I'm so glad there's no fear perfect love casts out all fear amen now Hebrews 2 and verse 14. just throw that one up and bold and underline it okay for as much they know he's speaking about how Jesus so he he goes from chapter one to chapter two and he's laying out to the Hebrews how Jesus was made a little lower than the angels He was made like one of us he was made he was born he was he was born sinless but he was born into the human race like we are bought and so he became out he became one of us amen and he said so for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood that's us we we are in Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him wait do I have that one oh yes no next verse we'll just read this he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil now next verse is what I want to get to and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage so he's saying he would deliver those Who deliver those who through the fear of death were a lifetime so he would deliver them who are under the fear of death so that's all Humanity people are scared religious people are scared are you following me you know people who it doesn't matter what religion you can be Catholic you can be a Muslim you can be a Hindu you can be a Seeker a Jain or a Methodist Presbyterian it doesn't matter what it is people have a fear and people motivate people to become Christians by fear that's not the way it's administered amen because they they tell people if you don't give your life you go to hell and some people become Christians motivated by fear we're not called to be motivated by fear amen it should be motivated by the Divine love there's a reason why brother bran when the angel came to him and he described the three pulls of his ministry are that you know there's the three phases or the three pulls it's because the reason it was called the pull is because there's a draw amen there was a there was a pull there's pulling people to to Christ and that's why love should pull you I'm in Divine love through the word should pull you to to him I mean it's not a push you're a beating you'll get a stick out and make people line up but it should be divine love should draw or soul says no man can come to unless my father draws them Hallelujah So Divine love must pull and that's why if we have lost lost loved ones or people who are not in yet that's why we need to call upon God God get a hold of them speak to them reveal yourself to them draw them Lord can we put that back up sorry so now if you fall in love if Divine love drops into your heart that all the fear of death we were all set who through the fear who through fear of death will all their lifetimes subject to bondage but then if Divine love drops in your heart which is the Holy Ghost God himself you're not you're not a slave you're not in bondage anymore you're free Hallelujah and that's why Paul or any of the Believers they were not they knew Paul knew what it was like to be delivered because imagine that you know you know the Jewish religion have I offered the right sacrifices have I won even the right you know you know it says don't mix the two types of material together you know have I done all the law because guilty the least is guilty of the whole you know have I ate the right food have I done the right things that would have put a real fear so he knew what it was like to be delivered Hallelujah where he knew he wasn't scared of his head being chopped off that day do you know they're going to cut your head off yep I know it wasn't brother talking about Peter I think Peter was in a prison with someone else you know are you Simon Peter yep he's in prison with another guy do you know they're going to kill you today yep are you scared nope are you sure yep you know and he begins to tell him the story he shares about this other guy with around dramatizing it he gives the testimony about how he met Jesus Christ and how he changed his life and then he is from the other side of the bar Simon Peter off he goes Hallelujah Paul would've been the same way Hallelujah you mean you mean my Earthly journey is done I've run my race I've finished my course a Crown of Life is awaiting me Hallelujah I'm ready he wasn't scared I think that's crazy that's not crazy if Divine love is sunken into your soul amen amen and by the cross of Calvary Divine Love Is Now released upon the Earth where we are governed individually by Divine love everything we do for the Lord should be motivated by love because of its love it's not human works amen it's not human works if your Mo if your life is motivated by love then it's not works because if you do it from out of love you don't make a list in your mind but I've done this this and this and this it's all Lord I love thee this is why I live this way Hallelujah so I said these things because this is what Christianity is it shouldn't be fear you know when I think of the rapture what I think of when I think of the wedding supper and leaving this Earth it makes me so happy amen because if Divine love drops in your heart you recognize that sovereignly given amen you know that you did not earn it you did not uh it wasn't seven steps to the rapture and and and some self-help book but it was God divinely coming to you amen it's one thing for man to call upon God but when God responds hallelujah amen that's the Glorious thing and so that's why it's an incredible thing where if there's a longing in here there's a longing to respond if there's a if there's a hunger I want to know the god that made all things then there's a God who made all things and he is the Lord Jesus Christ because you had a prophet stand in this day and he spoke life into existence he spoke tumors out of existence he spoke storms out of existence there's a power of creation through his word and that was not him that was God through him that was God proving I am the Creator and I am speaking through this man Hallelujah that's true that's why those things were done amen glory to God that's a Vindication this word is true because the Creator himself has never happened before amen and so now you say well if there's a longing for God there's a longing there's a God to meet that longing and the goddess was there before that longing ever dropped into your soul amen so don't let the devil rob you or don't push it to one side because if you have a longing you're the most blessed person amen you have the greatest thing you can't buy it you can't earn it you can't work it out you can't sit an exam and obtain it in any way it's just there Hallelujah yeah amen you say well you say that all the time it's a glorious thing Bill Gates and all of his wealth can't buy it amen amen America with all its wealth couldn't buy it for a single salt Hallelujah New Zealand surely couldn't buy it amen it's just given without money or price so that means you can't do anything in your own do I have to memorize this do I have to walk crawl up some steps and say some hell Mary is saying no sir you've just got to give yourself you're gonna say Lord take my life and make it thine amen and that is all Peter said repent be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for the mission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you shall be led by Divine love halleluia amen such a glorious thing so we shouldn't be scared you say well I'm scared of being left behind you don't have to stay scared you don't have to be scared God remember to me Christianity you can see it's it is it is the religion because you can see the death burial Resurrection in nature it is the only religion I mean real Bible Christianity that you can actually see it and see it and come into a family amen you see it with with parents and with children how God has got a God is a god of stability he wants you to be stable just like a parent you know like my girls when they play a game you're the mummy bear I'm the daddy I mean yo I'm the daddy bear mommy's The Mummy bear we're the baby bears or we're playing Eagles and I'm the daddy Eagle mum is the mummy eagle and they're the baby eagles there's always this family unit because it brings stability there's something built in them I need to know what I where where do I fit who am I and that's because now man is looking for that guy thing and that's how but that's how God is God wants you to know I'm I am your father you came out of me Hallelujah came out of me I birthed you upon this Earth amen you have my jeans in you Hallelujah you're part of me I'm your father and I'll look after you and I'll guide you through this life amen I want you to know that man amen that's why the first prayer Our Father a child in heaven Hallowed be thy name our father not o great Jehovah someplace Our Father which art in heaven so he wants you to know and that's why it's so you know that's why the Apostle Paul he takes Ephesians he takes many places in the scripture and he and he places he he God emphasizes so much who you are and what Christ has done amen so you see it in a family you see it in nature you see this Bible is set everywhere that God has made and to me that shows that this is true amen and it's been Vindicated thousands thousands of times but I mean you see naturally and so if we know then so he wants it as I said if you're afraid let him take the fear away don't be motivated by fear be motivated by love amen it's all about relationship now how we doing we're doing okay it's all about relationship and that's why that's why it's so important as parents they need to see god with skin on amen because how they relate to God will be actually how you've related to them amen so if you're so if you're a parent or a father will go down the farther way because that's well it's both ways but you know if you're a father that's always making them unsettled then who and who their identity is and pushing them away and being distant and putting complexes in them they'll think God's like that God's distant you know there'll be unstability in the walk subconsciously because that's being come down through the parent are you with me I mean all those things will be down through but then if we're parents where we're you're my child I tell my children all the time I'm your dad you're my girls your mommy's girls we're a family I'm the daddy I'm the daddy bear or the daddy eagle or the whatever amen I want them to know you know because now they know well this is mummy and daddy and and we're there and they love us and we love them and we're a family and it brings great stability in the life just as a little two by four you know I may get you know it does a that's a great stability and God wants it to be the same way and so do not let fear govern your Christian walk you don't have to stay that way amen you say well see because for me I said as God gives an assurance I have perfect assurance that I am going because I love him and the reason I love him is because I gave my life to him and he has received Me by his grace and if he has led me this far if I've made it this far amen if I've made it above the world Hallelujah and he's changed my nature and changed my my whole look of the life and my my ambitions hopes and plans are not to be a religious person or to make some Empire but to serve him amen amen if I've cast all my cares upon them if I've committed my life into his hands because he says all that come to me are no wise cast out right that's what he says he's not a man that can lie so I've given everything I am to him and he's received me so if he received me here I know he's going to receive me there amen I I just trust it comes out what I'm saying right but you've got to understand if I've committed my life and I love him you know you imagine someone humanly and this is not possible but a human being that you love that's never disappointed you one time you think about it you think someone who's always been there he's always he's never failed you you think you know just imagine if you had someone like that their word is always true they have no flaw in their character they never have any you say that they have real no Humanity because they're always perfect their word is always true they always do what they say they're always there for you if you committed your life into their hands you knew based on their character they won't value I'm speaking humanly speaking remember Jesus God became a man amen so if that's the case just naturally how much more with God okay we have come I'm not scared my life is in his hands whatever happens happens and that is true I'm not afraid of what tomorrow faces if the whole world turns against us or against me with this walk I'll say I'm sorry I can't I would gladly go I understand why the martyrs could go I actually understand because yet having not seen yet love with joy unspeakable full of Glory how could you how could you deny the one you love the one you've identified yourself with amen the one that means the most you in all your life well you've never seen this one before Oh but I know he speaks to me I speak back to him his presence comes down I'm motivated by love they went into the Coliseum by love amen they went to the stake by love they were ripped apart because you know they they went gladly it's not fair or if I do this and he'll do this no the Hebrew children if they were they were believers they said well if they if God delivers us he will if he doesn't he doesn't we're going to go anyway amen so a whole life should be governed by Divine love now we've come to this evening and it's always a very important time I'd like this one to be a you know the communion you think of Jesus now those last few moments upon the Earth before East crucified he takes the cup you know he begins to speak just disciples about many things and life was going to change life the world changed that you know those few days the world changed drastically and it's the same with the the same with uh you know the Israelites going out of Egypt the Passover night the world has changed they're not slaves anymore very few moments not very long after that they are walking free going going to another world we if you're a Christian tonight somewhere down life's Road you gave your life to him and Assurance came in that you are going to another world that you know where you're going and when we take the Lord's Supper take the communion we are doing this in remembrance of him we are remembering the Lord's death remember the penalty of sin was an incredible thing where God had to become a man to fulfill his own law to take the Wrath that should have been poured out upon us he gladly took it upon himself Hallelujah that's Divine love because he couldn't lose he couldn't lose part of himself so he gladly put on human flesh there's the joy that was set before him was you redeemed amen The Joy it says the joy that was set before him he despised the cross you know you know he gladly embraced the cross because there was a joy before him I'm going to have a people they're going to be Redeemed by my blood they're going to be you know they're going to be I'm going to Ransom them with my blood I'm going to take their sin upon me I'm going to carry it up Calvary as a man because it was a joy set before him here we are in life's journey I trust there's a joy it was so real to him he was a man he had to believe the word like we have to believe the word because he was all God but it was all man right so he had to have the the word was revealed to him that he would not his he would not uh God so his he would not be in the ground I will not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption he had that as the scripture that he went to Calvary with that he knew that his body he wouldn't be left in the Tomb but he had resurrect again before corruption set in that was but so but the joy that was set before him was us around a wedding supper table he comes out in his glory I mean after all the bibles are closed the arms are stacked and we're gone up to Father's House amen and we're sitting around the wedding supper table however however it's arranged I don't know I'm not too worried about the details and then the doors open then he walks down that's great splendor he says and he wipes away all tears you don't need to cry anymore children it's all over and the thing is we'll have to stop crying there's something in us we'll just stop you'll come wipe away all the tears it's all right Hallelujah this was the joy set before you amen this is the joy kahira joy that was you being redeemed we should have a joy we're going to a wedding supper Hallelujah and that's why when we take the communion we should say thank you God you came and paid the you became me you became sin that I'd become your very righteousness and I wasn't looking for you I wasn't didn't have some ambition when I was first born I wanna I wanna meet you but something in me I'm a human the you're the human spirit the kind of humanity does not seek after God doesn't seek it says in the Book of Romans not 1 6 after him not one so there has to be something beyond your Humanity crying out Hallelujah I'm so glad for that aren't you friends amen and you may not be able to put it in words to begin with but I'll tell you it's because there's a joy set before you I mean there's a wedding supper table and so now when we come to the communion because he he gives us such an assurance I trust you have that Assurance I won't leave you nor forsake you I'll go with you I'll lead you through every dark place though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil for thou art with me amen I won't leave you upon the Earth I'm going to take you off this Earth amen because of my sacrifice that day on Calvary Hallelujah I'm going to take you away Hallelujah because of love we love him it's just a shadow of how he feels about you you mean well there's no Great Value in me you don't know what you are to him I mean when the where the prophet of God said one soul is worth ten thousand worlds you can't put a price on 10 000 worlds one sold's worth ten thousand worlds that's the value he puts on you Hallelujah and he doesn't and he never and it is great thinking I don't believe you have said well ten thousand worlds times however many redeemed can I afford it he didn't weigh it up he just went Hallelujah So Adam quickly took Eve to us himself amen sorry it's glorious friends he doesn't weigh it up he just came remember the first promise the first prophecy ever given in the Bible is the seed of the woman will Bruce the head of the seat of the serpent that was the first promise of the Redeemer coming Hallelujah the first promise amen I'm coming Hallelujah and he came in the flesh died for you and I Rose forevermore sent a spirit down upon the Earth amen thank you and here he is today in 2017. brooding over Humanity in a drawers to himself amen and that's why we should be so glad when we take the communion Lord you promised me you're not a man that can lie I'm not I'm not taking this out of fear I love you and whatever you want to do with me Glory Be unto thee Hallelujah brother Brown was told one day I may get the story mixed up with another one but he but he said about how someone said well you're an antichrist and he said well if that's what the Lord wants me to be that's what I'll be and he and he and he said he said that if God would cast him to hell he'll worship Him Anyway amen because Divine love so governed his life Hallelujah redeeming love was his thing and it should be our theme as well amen and I had the same not to put myself in that bracket but I remember when I was first a you know a Believer and the devil Twisted the scripture against me saying if you sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there's no more sacrifice for sin and he basically Twisted in my mind if it's like if you're a little child and your parents say don't do it for you go do it then it's then you're out there's no more sacrifice and my heart literally went like a lead lead balloon but then I came to the conclusion I was actually it's amazing what happens in someone's heart when you're just mopping a floor as I was working in the kitchen I just mopping in Florida this was going on and um and just like a lead weight but then I just read the supernatural books where brother Brandon was talking to brother Billy Paul before he goes out into the world you know and he's and and they're outside washing the car and brother Bram tells Billy Paul to stand like this and his shadow made a cross on the wall and brother Bram said to him you're here like at the intersection which way are you gonna go which arm are you going to go and I came to the conclusion well Lord there's no way the world has nothing for me I don't want to go back so I must just take down this arm I'm going this way I said well at least at least you know if you do cast me to hell at least I get an opportunity one day to stand before you face to face and tell you that I love you and then you can do what you want with me Hallelujah amen do I feel any better no I didn't feel any better next hour went to church had a glorious time hallelujah amen that's Divine love amen I trust you feel the same way you should feel the same way oh you say it's an emotion anything without emotion is dead the prophet says amen because when when the pressure really comes on he'll come upon the scene amen and his love will come back to your mind come back to your heart but he means too much to me why would I want to do anything contrary to his word he means too much to me amen I trust you feel the same way Hallelujah so now let's just read let's just turn to First Corinthians chapter 11. so it's a glorious occasion he promised he's taking us away I do not believe we're going down some Garden Path I do not believe it I believe we are walking in the perfect will of God I believe we are walking up to heaven I believe he's molding and shaping us into his image and I was thinking the other day you know my girls even though they're girls they are made in my image right they may only be this big but they're still made in my image right it's just an immature image of me it just needs to mature and grow right so when people say oh we're Made In His Image sometimes we put it off you know as in we need to be the fullness of the Statue of Christ and then we're Made In His Image now when you're birthed amen when you're birthed your maiden is image but you just need to grow and mature Hallelujah I'm glad we grow and mature in him I mean so I Believe by God's Sovereign Grace we are walking with him I believe it I believe that this is not cunningly devised fables of man I believe that we are walking the Holy Spirit has taken us by the I say the heart and is leading us individually up into the rapture I believe with all my heart amen and I believe God by his Spirit comes down among us and not just in church wherever we are he comes out and confirms his word to you because he wants you to know you're not just going with the crowd Hallelujah you're not just going with the crowd but I have got a hold of you you've given my life you've given me your life and I'm leading you have that Assurance I trust you do amen and the beautiful thing is it's all his work amen Divine love now First Corinthians chapter 11. we'll go verse 23. ah so glad to be a Christian Hallelujah I'd rather have the worst day ever as a believer then the best day you could ever have in the world I would rather have you couldn't pay me to have that best day I'd rather have the worst day as a believer Hallelujah for I've received of the Lord that which also I've delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this still in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament of my blood this do ye as off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself so and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if ye would judge if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we shall be chastened to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come so when you come if you come and partake of the Lord's table you should do it because you're a Christian you're a believer and that everything is under the blood right the table is open to anyone whosoever will but you've got to examine it says let a man examine himself okay so it's a glorious time because on one hand remember the the unleavened bread and the wine they're just symbolic they're not literal doesn't literally turn into his body and it's symbolic but you are giving a public testimony I have become part of him amen I am I am one with my Lord Jesus Christ I'm identified with this death burial Resurrection and so it's not a it's a symbolic thing but you're making a testimony I've become one he's he's enjoined himself to me so it's a glorious thing because one is you're showing everyone he's given me the promise I'm going right but on the other hand you've got to examine yourself that everything's right okay so it's not just a ritual redeem us back to yourself so father
