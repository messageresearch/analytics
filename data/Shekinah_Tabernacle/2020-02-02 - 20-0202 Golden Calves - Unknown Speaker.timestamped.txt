[48:59] earlier here so anyway um you just throw
[49:02] that up let's go to first Kings chapter
[49:04] 11 and I want to I've been kind of off
[49:07] and on speaking about you know
[49:09] identifying the Antichrist spirit and um
[49:12] it's you know if we can discern and
[49:14] withstand that into our spirit then the
[49:16] the bride will be an invincible army so
[49:18] I just want to kind of keep in that kind
[49:21] of vein of thought yeah let's go we are
[49:26] we honor we offer we where are we first
[49:29] first Kings chapter 11 and we're going
[49:31] to read from verse 26 I don't have the
[49:35] entire thing up but I just want to show
[49:37] a couple of diagrams more than anything
[49:39] but let's go to first Kings 11 in 26 and
[49:41] and Jeroboam the son of Nebat
[49:45] and if if a night of Rida
[49:48] Solomon's servant whose mother's name
[49:50] was as Errol
[49:51] would a woman when he lifted up his hand
[49:53] against the king and this was the cause
[49:55] that he lifted up his hand against the
[49:57] King Solomon built me low and repaired
[50:00] the breaches of the City of David his
[50:01] father and the man Jeroboam was a mighty
[50:03] man of Valor and Solomon seeing the
[50:05] young man that he was industrious he
[50:07] made him ruler over all the charge of
[50:09] the house of Joseph and it came to pass
[50:11] at that time when Jeroboam went out of
[50:14] Jerusalem that the prophet Elijah the
[50:17] Sheila night found him in the way and
[50:19] equal anyway he had cleared himself with
[50:22] a new government and they too were alone
[50:25] in the field in a higher court the new
[50:27] garment that was on who had rented in 12
[50:29] pieces and said to Joe balm take the 10
[50:32] pieces for thus said the Lord the God of
[50:34] Israel
[50:34] behold I'll rend the kingdom out of the
[50:37] hand of Solomon and will give 10 tribes
[50:39] to thee but he shall have one tribe for
[50:42] my servant David sake and for
[50:44] Jerusalem's sake the city which I've
[50:45] chosen out of all the tribes of Israel
[50:47] because that they have forsaken me and
[50:50] have worship Astaroth the goddess of the
[50:52] sidonians she washed the god of the
[50:55] moabites and milcom the god of the
[50:58] children of Ammon and have not walked in
[51:00] my ways to do that which is right in my
[51:01] eyes to keep my statutes and my
[51:03] judgments as did David his father how
[51:06] bid I'll not take the whole kingdom out
[51:07] of his hand but I will make him a prince
[51:09] all the days of his life for David my
[51:11] servants sake whom I chose because he
[51:13] kept my Commandments in my statutes and
[51:15] I will take the kingdom out of his son's
[51:18] hands and will give it unto thee even
[51:21] ten tribes now this just dropped down to
[51:23] the next chapter chapter 12 we're gonna
[51:25] read from verse 25 and we're just going
[51:28] to read down to verse 33 here it says
[51:31] then Jeroboam so now he's been made
[51:34] kingly the the you know that he's now
[51:37] king over the ten tribes the Israel is
[51:39] divided into two kingdoms now then
[51:41] Jeremiah built Shechem and Mount Ephraim
[51:44] and dwelt therein and went out from
[51:46] thence and built pineal and Jeroboam
[51:49] said in his heart
[51:50] now notice is reasoning now she held the
[51:51] kingdom returned to the house of David
[51:53] if this people go up to do sacrifice in
[51:56] the house of the Lord of Jerusalem then
[51:58] shall the heart of this people turn
[52:00] again unto the Lord even as a real bomb
[52:03] the king of Judah and Asia
[52:04] kill me and go again to Rio Bom king of
[52:07] Judah whereupon the king took counsel
[52:10] and made two calves of gold and said
[52:12] unto Him it is too much for you to go up
[52:13] to Jerusalem behold thy God's o Israel
[52:15] what's brought thee up out of the land
[52:17] of Egypt and he sent he set the one in
[52:20] Bethel and the other he put and an and
[52:22] this thing became a sin for the people
[52:24] went to worship before one even unto Dan
[52:26] and he made an house of high places and
[52:29] made priests of the last of the people
[52:31] which were not the sons of Levi and
[52:33] Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth
[52:35] month on the fifteenth day of the month
[52:37] like under the feast that is in Judah
[52:39] and he offered upon the altar so he did
[52:41] and Bethel sacrificing unto the calves
[52:43] that he had made and placed and Bethel
[52:45] the priests of the high places which he
[52:47] had made so he offered unto thee
[52:49] I mean upon the altar which he made in
[52:52] Bethel the fifteenth day of the 8th
[52:54] month even in the month which he had
[52:56] devised of his own heart and ordained to
[52:58] feast and unto the children of Israel
[53:01] and he offered upon the altar and burnt
[53:04] incense I mean made the Lord bless his
[53:07] word you may have your seats this
[53:08] morning I want to speak about three
[53:13] places we have in the scripture notice
[53:17] Jeroboam he he built a golden he built
[53:21] two golden calves I'm going to take this
[53:22] a bit slow than maybe we'll see if we
[53:24] change gear but he he made two golden
[53:27] calves he put one and Bethel he put the
[53:29] other and Dan but the third place is
[53:31] Jerusalem now this man Jeroboam it's
[53:35] amazing he was yo all day in profit went
[53:38] to him said you could have you're gonna
[53:40] be king over ten tribes but who knows in
[53:42] his mind he began to form a plan how can
[53:45] I keep control of the people now this is
[53:48] the greatest curse that can come upon a
[53:50] group of people as we in the ministry in
[53:53] their own mind try and hold on to them
[53:55] and they try and join the people to the
[53:57] ministry as opposed to the Word of God
[53:59] and this is what Jeroboam was doing he
[54:02] was thinking in his mind how can I bind
[54:04] the people that they will not go worship
[54:06] with God has ordained them to worship
[54:08] because he was worried that the people
[54:10] he said as we just read that that the
[54:13] people would go worship and Jerusalem
[54:15] and the influence of rear bomb would
[54:17] come upon them and in the
[54:18] would kill him and and and the kingdom
[54:20] would go back to Rio Bom but the thing
[54:22] is that remember God ordained a place of
[54:24] worship and we're going to go into that
[54:26] soon but you know God would say in
[54:28] Deuteronomy you will worship and the
[54:29] gate right put my name now we know that
[54:32] Jesus is the gate he is the door so the
[54:35] true place to worship is in Jesus Christ
[54:37] and we'll come to that but I just want
[54:39] to show you that this is what people
[54:41] have done is that is that men have have
[54:44] risen up and this is many more you know
[54:47] I'm speaking about our age that we live
[54:49] and men have risen up under their own
[54:50] devices to actually use the word of God
[54:54] to bind people to themselves as opposed
[54:56] to uniting them with Christ you know as
[54:58] the Apostle Paul he he his burden was
[55:01] you know that I travailed until Christ
[55:04] be formed in you he says I've espoused
[55:05] you to one husband which is Christ the
[55:08] Lord you know he had no interest of
[55:11] binding people to himself he even warned
[55:13] that men would rise up binding people to
[55:15] to their own selves and this is the
[55:17] greatest curse that can come as where
[55:19] since their people can begin to worship
[55:20] God but then an antichrist spirit comes
[55:23] in to take the worship from the people
[55:25] that that should be to God and actually
[55:27] put it upon a man remember we are not
[55:29] married to William Branham I mean we are
[55:32] not married to this church this the name
[55:34] of this church is irrelevant we are
[55:36] united to Jesus Christ the word brother
[55:39] Brown would say at the end of his
[55:40] ministry says we are following the
[55:42] church across the nation because you're
[55:44] the dressing
[55:45] you know churches through the telephone
[55:46] hookup he says we are following Jesus
[55:48] Christ the word right and it's the same
[55:50] thing today we are still following Jesus
[55:53] Christ the Living Word so Jeroboam II he
[55:56] decides he's gonna put these two calves
[55:58] and it's amazing wait maybe I don't want
[56:00] to do that let's just now I don't know
[56:03] if you can see this very well but this
[56:04] is a map of this is the map of Israel
[56:06] where the twelve tribes settled and I've
[56:10] put the scripture here that we read he
[56:11] see he set one and Bethel and he put the
[56:14] other one in there now this is very
[56:16] significant as as I'll show you but I
[56:19] want to keep in your mind that that here
[56:22] is here is Jerusalem and Benjamin and I
[56:24] kind of like that on a side note anyway
[56:28] I like that
[56:31] anyway anyway so he put what and then
[56:34] and the other and Bethel so if you do
[56:36] your research you'll find out well Dan
[56:38] of course here's the tribe of Dan but
[56:39] Bethel is actually in Ephraim and it's
[56:42] actually on the border between Benjamin
[56:44] and and Ephraim and originally actually
[56:47] Joshua gave gave where Bethel was to the
[56:51] tribe of Benjamin but then Ephraim
[56:52] invaded and and they took the place but
[56:55] it's amazing when you look into it where
[56:56] Bethel was only about 15 miles north of
[56:59] Jerusalem so close so close to where God
[57:03] put his name but it's too far to go and
[57:05] you may have journeyed from Asher all
[57:07] the way up here you've done in it and
[57:08] then instead of going here you come here
[57:10] so people get so close but you know what
[57:13] happens is we're going to understand a
[57:14] golden calf as man's ideas fashioned
[57:17] into a God and people take the Word of
[57:19] God because remember an antichrist
[57:20] spirit can only pervert what God has
[57:22] already put forth so an antichrist
[57:24] spirit comes a man takes quotes and
[57:27] scriptures and quotes and scriptures
[57:28] quotes and scriptures and and the
[57:30] conclusion of what their what their
[57:32] argument is not what the prophets said
[57:33] it's not what the Word of God said and
[57:35] they're fashioned in Idol and they say
[57:38] here is the God that the prophet
[57:39] followed but you find out the life that
[57:41] was then the Prophet is not in the
[57:42] people well and that is a proof that
[57:45] what they're worshiping is not actually
[57:46] the word it's actually men's ideas that
[57:48] have been formed into a formed into a
[57:50] golden calf so now this is member if you
[57:55] can discern withstand the Antichrist
[57:58] spirit because remember it's the ones
[58:00] that are most close to the truth that
[58:04] use the quotes dress right maybe even
[58:08] act right but no life and it's a golden
[58:11] calf worship now I will read this now
[58:16] this isn't Deuteronomy 16 I just want to
[58:19] read this here maybe just read it from
[58:23] the screen so our technology in me we
[58:26] found out we're not good friends no
[58:28] season Deuteronomy 16 so this is where
[58:29] brother Branham would preach God's
[58:31] chosen place of worship
[58:32] he says observe the month of Abbot which
[58:35] is April and keep the Passover under the
[58:37] Lord thy God and the month of a bird the
[58:39] LORD thy God brought thee forth out of
[58:41] Egypt by night thou shalt therefore
[58:43] sacrifice the Passover and the LORD thy
[58:46] God of the flock in the hood and the
[58:48] place which the Lord shall choose two
[58:50] places named this they had specific
[58:52] instructions don't just worship anywhere
[58:54] where I've put my name there's where
[58:56] your worship
[58:57] thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it
[58:59] seven days shalt thou not eat a leavened
[59:02] bread there worth even the bread of
[59:03] affliction for thou camest forth out of
[59:06] the land of Egypt and hast that thou
[59:08] mayst remember the day when thou comest
[59:09] for that land of Egypt all the days of
[59:12] thy life and there shall be no leavened
[59:14] bread seen with thee in all thy coasts
[59:16] seven days neither that shall there
[59:19] be anything of the flesh which they'll
[59:21] sacrifice us the first day and even
[59:23] remain all night until the morning thou
[59:25] mayst not sacrifice the Passover within
[59:27] any of thy gates which the LORD thy God
[59:30] giveth thee but but at the place where
[59:32] the LORD thy God shall choose two places
[59:34] namin there thou shalt sacrifice the
[59:36] Passover even at the going down of the
[59:38] Sun at the season without Commerce forth
[59:41] out of Egypt this is very specific
[59:42] instruction don't worship any gate
[59:44] doesn't matter how pretty the Gators how
[59:47] great the churches how wonderful the
[59:48] music is how great the people are
[59:50] worship God where he put his name and he
[59:54] put his name in his son Jesus Christ
[59:55] which is the word I mean so that's why
[59:59] that's why I wanted to put that in there
[1:00:01] because now we know Jerusalem even Jesus
[1:00:03] would say to the woman at the well
[1:00:04] they'll come a day where people won't
[1:00:06] worship here no more but the father
[1:00:08] seeketh into worship God in spirit and
[1:00:11] truth so now when I'm talking about
[1:00:12] Jerusalem I'm not talking about a
[1:00:14] geographical location I talk about where
[1:00:16] God has put his name in his word right
[1:00:18] in the revelation of the hour now this
[1:00:23] is this is what Jesus just he did John
[1:00:25] John for if you need a reference now
[1:00:27] this is the this is how the children of
[1:00:30] Israel they were this is their formation
[1:00:33] when they traveled after Mount Sinai you
[1:00:35] know they built the tabernacle in the
[1:00:37] wilderness and this is how the twelve
[1:00:39] tribes would march and they were in a
[1:00:41] formation which which was representing a
[1:00:44] pattern which is in heaven now we know
[1:00:47] that the that the ark here I mean so the
[1:00:49] Ark of the testimony here was was you
[1:00:52] know the Ark of the Covenant and the
[1:00:53] tabernacle and then the tribes were
[1:00:55] camped around in a certain order
[1:00:57] and there was around each of these so in
[1:01:01] these each groups there's one tribe over
[1:01:03] the other two so here a frame was in
[1:01:06] charge of the west side and then Dan was
[1:01:08] in charge of the north and and due to
[1:01:10] the east and then Reuben the South and
[1:01:12] what this shows is now there's always
[1:01:15] been the way to the Tree of Life has
[1:01:18] always been guarded the way to it if you
[1:01:20] read in Genesis you know it says that
[1:01:22] God placed a cherubim with the flaming
[1:01:24] sword it says to protect the way not to
[1:01:27] protect the tree of life but to protect
[1:01:29] the way to the Tree of Life so the
[1:01:32] access has always been guarded right and
[1:01:36] and we know that you know the scripture
[1:01:38] you know even you know when brother Bram
[1:01:40] here would he would speak about Matthew
[1:01:41] 28:19 baptized in the name of the Father
[1:01:44] Son and the Holy Ghost he says that's a
[1:01:46] gospel God because many people trip over
[1:01:49] they miss out that one word name the
[1:01:52] Prophet you see well what's the name
[1:01:54] father's not a name sons not a name Holy
[1:01:56] Ghost is not a name and you can read
[1:01:58] through church history and it's been
[1:02:00] documented very well that the Catholic
[1:02:01] Church or pre Catholic Church they
[1:02:04] change the baptism from the name of Lord
[1:02:06] Jesus Christ to the titles of God father
[1:02:08] son Holy Ghost
[1:02:09] it's very well documented right so so
[1:02:12] now he says that's a gospel guard
[1:02:13] stopping people actually stopping people
[1:02:15] walk into the way to go into the Tree of
[1:02:17] Life and so now we have and then you go
[1:02:22] to the Book of Ezekiel I'm not going to
[1:02:24] go through it but there's the cherubim
[1:02:25] said Ezekiel sees they have a face of a
[1:02:27] lion lion ox man and an eagle and then
[1:02:31] you come down through down to the book
[1:02:33] of Revelation and John sees the same
[1:02:34] cherubims but in the Book of Ezekiel
[1:02:37] they only have they have wheels showing
[1:02:40] that the that the Gospels and transition
[1:02:43] but then when when john sees it they
[1:02:46] don't have wheels no more because now
[1:02:47] it's it's actually fixed in its place
[1:02:50] the the axis the arc is finished moving
[1:02:54] because now it's the word of god
[1:02:56] manifested but that's a whole nother
[1:02:57] thing but when i throw that in there but
[1:02:59] what we have now is well i always get
[1:03:02] things mixed up so just you don't mind
[1:03:04] me just go and slow now so Dan so this
[1:03:10] as I see it as the
[1:03:11] there's actually the four cherubims
[1:03:13] guarding the way to the Tree of Life so
[1:03:18] now what we have is we have Ruben is
[1:03:20] that into fighters a man we know that
[1:03:22] the for their faith bills are at the
[1:03:24] face of a man and then Judah of course
[1:03:26] is the lion 'iframe as the ox now I'm
[1:03:30] speaking about these things as these
[1:03:31] things were going to bring out why did
[1:03:33] Jeroboam
[1:03:34] put the golden calf and Dan and Annie
[1:03:36] frame and we showed that the devil uses
[1:03:39] the same thing against believers today
[1:03:40] and then now always missed the fourth
[1:03:43] one we have in den was the Eagle which
[1:03:47] is the pattern of the cherubims and so
[1:03:51] this was built in such a way now I just
[1:03:53] want to highlight this so when he put in
[1:03:56] Bethel he put 1:1 cherubim I mean sorry
[1:04:02] he put one golden calf Jeroboam did he
[1:04:05] put one and den which is the Eagle Eagle
[1:04:09] anointing he put a golden calf he set it
[1:04:12] up I'm gonna go through these but I'm
[1:04:13] just gonna give you an overview then
[1:04:14] we're gonna break it down he put one and
[1:04:17] the prophetic word of the hour
[1:04:19] he put a golden calf and the open word
[1:04:23] he put a golden calf and said of the
[1:04:25] people going to Jerusalem I wonder you
[1:04:28] think about this and then he put the
[1:04:30] other one in II frame and he frame
[1:04:32] symbol as an ox so he put a golden calf
[1:04:35] ox as a beast of burden
[1:04:38] so the people's works he put a golden
[1:04:41] calf there that people will worship
[1:04:44] their own works above going actually to
[1:04:48] Jerusalem but the RAM no I don't know if
[1:04:52] I have this I don't have it on the slide
[1:04:54] but but he says this he says this in the
[1:04:56] paradox and this is paradox in 1965 17th
[1:05:00] of January he says you have to you do
[1:05:05] have something into it that's your
[1:05:08] surrender of your own world your own
[1:05:09] ideas to the will and idea of Almighty
[1:05:12] God and that's finished that's all there
[1:05:15] is just take his promise don't think of
[1:05:17] nothing else walk by it and God does the
[1:05:20] rest of it then they wanted a law and
[1:05:22] God always gives you the desire of your
[1:05:24] heart
[1:05:25] he promised to but we find out when they
[1:05:28] turned one step from the side of what
[1:05:30] God really promised them then that was a
[1:05:33] thorn and the flesh until the law was
[1:05:35] taken away until Jesus Christ came and
[1:05:37] was crew crucified to take away the law
[1:05:39] it was a thorn in the flesh and anything
[1:05:43] you try and do within yourself it'll
[1:05:45] always work to your dishonor it'll work
[1:05:47] to your disadvantage just simply believe
[1:05:50] God that settles that what God promised
[1:05:52] on the law by God who heals all my by
[1:05:54] diseases see if there is any among you
[1:05:56] sick let them call the elders of the
[1:05:58] church he promised the works that he did
[1:06:00] would be done in his church why do we
[1:06:03] have to accept organizations and so
[1:06:05] forth that will write them off of the
[1:06:07] off of the book see it becomes a thorn
[1:06:10] and the flesh and here at the end time
[1:06:12] we meet the same thing again face to
[1:06:14] face that's up to the Methodists
[1:06:15] Baptists Presbyterians what more see you
[1:06:17] can't go on you've got to come back to
[1:06:20] the entire Full Gospel right it was made
[1:06:23] for the full man by a complete God who
[1:06:26] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[1:06:28] know that those things are true now if
[1:06:30] you notice then their journey in the
[1:06:32] wilderness is where they've got their
[1:06:33] greatest mistake that has ever made
[1:06:35] until Calvary was when in Exodus 19 they
[1:06:38] accepted lore instead of grace they had
[1:06:40] grace they had a prophet they had a
[1:06:41] sacrificial lamb they had Redemption
[1:06:43] they had brought through the Red Sea
[1:06:46] they had been healed of their diseases
[1:06:47] they had water from the smitten Rock
[1:06:49] they had manner out of heaven everything
[1:06:51] that need of had been supplied but they
[1:06:53] still wanted something else and he says
[1:06:58] as a thorn Creed's and dogmas as a thorn
[1:07:00] in the flesh now we can go to this just
[1:07:03] now I want to know this now the son of
[1:07:05] Jeroboam was a curse to Israel and it
[1:07:09] caused them to leave the land and we'll
[1:07:11] get let's just go to 2nd Kings and we're
[1:07:14] gonna read that 2nd Kings chapter 17 and
[1:07:16] to me it's one of the saddest things you
[1:07:20] say well thou just under the blood of
[1:07:21] bulls and goats but yet God had provided
[1:07:24] them a word and if they even just in
[1:07:27] their own humanity kept that word they
[1:07:30] would have been victorious now he's
[1:07:32] given us more than just the blood of
[1:07:33] bulls and goats now he's given us a
[1:07:34] power that can change our nature I mean
[1:07:36] it's not just an outward
[1:07:38] keeping of a law but God can come in and
[1:07:40] change our nature that now we are living
[1:07:43] his word out because it's in us already
[1:07:45] right I'll write their laws my laws in
[1:07:48] their hearts and they shall do them
[1:07:50] right it's not us doing it it's him
[1:07:52] doing it in us now second King 17 and
[1:07:55] we're just going to go down to verse
[1:07:57] verse 19 and you know it's such a
[1:08:00] tragedy you say well we're under the
[1:08:03] blood of Jesus Christ these same
[1:08:05] tragedies can still happen and they have
[1:08:08] happened and I pray they stop happening
[1:08:12] seeking King 17 we're gonna read from
[1:08:14] verse I believe I said nineteen also
[1:08:16] Judah you can read the whole this yo yo
[1:08:18] this whole chapter but and also Judah
[1:08:21] kept not the commandments of the Lord
[1:08:22] their God but walked in the statutes of
[1:08:24] Israel which they made and the Lord
[1:08:27] rejected all the seed of Israel and
[1:08:29] afflicted them and delivered them into
[1:08:30] the hand of the spoilers until he cast
[1:08:32] them out of his sight for inna Israel
[1:08:35] from the house of David and they made
[1:08:36] your Obama the son of Nebat King and
[1:08:39] Jeroboam drivers Ralph from following
[1:08:41] the Lord and made them sinner great sin
[1:08:43] for the children of Israel walked in all
[1:08:46] the ways of Jeroboam which he did they
[1:08:49] departed not from them until the Lord
[1:08:51] removed Israel out of his sight as he
[1:08:54] had said by all of his servants the
[1:08:55] prophets so was Israel carried away out
[1:08:57] of their own land to Assyria and to this
[1:09:00] day so because of the sin these golden
[1:09:04] calves it's too much for you to go to
[1:09:05] Jerusalem just worship here worship this
[1:09:10] man's made idea it was a sin and it
[1:09:13] caused them to leave the land so they
[1:09:15] left the Word of God completely they
[1:09:17] were driven from it there out of the
[1:09:18] promise completely because they worship
[1:09:20] these golden calves instead of
[1:09:22] worshiping God and spurred on and truth
[1:09:24] in the place where God put his name now
[1:09:26] we see if you know as as Jeroboam placer
[1:09:30] placed a golden calf any frame as I said
[1:09:33] he frames symbol as an ox the beast of
[1:09:36] burden it's a man's works you know we
[1:09:38] know even the four Gospels are written
[1:09:40] according to the four for your
[1:09:43] anointings and you take the book of Mark
[1:09:45] and it just goes straight into Christ's
[1:09:47] works it's under that ox anointing and
[1:09:48] people won't actually make a golden calf
[1:09:51] out of there
[1:09:52] own ability to keep the Word of God they
[1:09:55] will they will judge their their their
[1:09:57] their Christian walk by maybe how long
[1:09:59] their dresses are how maybe loose
[1:10:01] fitting their clothes are nothing wrong
[1:10:02] with those things you know they'll judge
[1:10:04] by how long they read how long they pray
[1:10:05] how much they'd listen how much they
[1:10:07] witness how much they come to church and
[1:10:08] they will gauge their and then how much
[1:10:11] their families in line and your
[1:10:12] conformity to the word and they will
[1:10:14] judge their Christian walk by those
[1:10:17] standards but both of em says at the end
[1:10:20] of his ministry he says we're not saved
[1:10:21] by measuring stick but saved by grace a
[1:10:24] divine influence upon the heart and it's
[1:10:26] reflection in the life and so people
[1:10:28] will make a golden calf out of their own
[1:10:31] works and that's the problem when people
[1:10:34] begin to look at look at what I've
[1:10:35] achieved look what I have done and even
[1:10:38] they may say well it's God's grace but
[1:10:39] in their hearts they say no it's me and
[1:10:41] my determination and I'm gonna do it and
[1:10:43] I'm going to serve the Lord it's good to
[1:10:45] have a determination but you got to give
[1:10:46] it over to God but he's going to take
[1:10:48] that design let her manifest themselves
[1:10:50] through it it's not you doing it
[1:10:52] remember we will never take a rapture by
[1:10:54] our own ability even by our own desire
[1:10:56] and enthusiasm our own ambition it will
[1:10:59] never get us there it's God revealing us
[1:11:02] worth sovereignty to your soul and him
[1:11:03] quickening your mortal body I mean by
[1:11:05] the spirit already in you that's the
[1:11:07] only way it can happen right but they
[1:11:10] but he he did not want them to go to
[1:11:12] Jerusalem to worship member where
[1:11:14] Jerusalem and Jerusalem was the ark and
[1:11:16] Jerusalem was the presence of God where
[1:11:19] people could really worship but but
[1:11:20] Jeroboam didn't want to want them to go
[1:11:22] there now that's just that's we say
[1:11:26] that's very Elementary it is Elementary
[1:11:30] but then when we come in to Dan as the
[1:11:32] more subtle things and we can and now
[1:11:36] when brother Brown said when the when
[1:11:37] the seals came open the eagle began to
[1:11:39] fly so the so the man agent 19 came to
[1:11:43] an end and then the eagle anointing came
[1:11:46] upon the church so there's a
[1:11:48] dispensational change when the book came
[1:11:50] open amen now under the under the yo
[1:11:56] when the word came open now that so so
[1:11:58] the church is to be under this prophetic
[1:12:01] anointing where the word that was
[1:12:03] released through the prophet of God
[1:12:05] would come into the people and they
[1:12:07] would have the same insight as the
[1:12:10] Prophet did so remember it's no good
[1:12:13] just teaching someone something if it's
[1:12:15] just up here but if the spirit that's
[1:12:17] upon the teacher comes upon the pupil
[1:12:19] right they will see what the teacher is
[1:12:21] is speaking about amen so now under the
[1:12:26] so when that when the wood came open
[1:12:29] brother Ben said the Eagle began to fly
[1:12:31] so now we are living in an eagle age how
[1:12:35] lujah we're living in an eagle age but
[1:12:37] this is the most can be the most
[1:12:39] dangerous age because the thing is as I
[1:12:42] see it I think last Sunday is that as
[1:12:44] even as Moses would would would tell the
[1:12:47] people of Israel Deuteronomy 29 you know
[1:12:49] they've been 40 years in the wilderness
[1:12:51] they've seen great things we see as you
[1:12:52] haven't been given a heart to perceive
[1:12:54] or eyes to see until this day yet you
[1:12:56] saw all the miracles and it as the
[1:12:59] message unfolded to the Prophet it
[1:13:01] unfolds to us right we don't know
[1:13:03] everything you know God going all the
[1:13:05] way down through the scripture has
[1:13:07] always use what we call progressive
[1:13:08] revelation and that shouldn't be a scary
[1:13:10] thing he progressively revealed himself
[1:13:12] to Abraham right when God first revealed
[1:13:16] himself to Abraham he said just leave
[1:13:17] this land go to another land
[1:13:19] he told him nothing about this is this
[1:13:21] is where your seeds gonna sojourn you're
[1:13:23] gonna have a son you know he told him
[1:13:25] nothing about those things when he first
[1:13:27] called him but as and then as God
[1:13:29] revealed himself to Abraham he revealed
[1:13:31] himself as Melchizedek as al-shehri I
[1:13:33] you know as as yo as the Lord God
[1:13:36] Almighty he revealed himself in
[1:13:38] different ways was the same God
[1:13:39] revealing more room self to Abraham so
[1:13:42] Abraham's revelation grew has
[1:13:44] understanding became more perfect but at
[1:13:47] the beginning it wasn't so as the same
[1:13:50] thing with the bride even you take the
[1:13:51] prophets ministry his revelation is
[1:13:54] understand God greater as he walked with
[1:13:56] God as the season changed in the book
[1:13:59] came open brother Graham said the Bible
[1:14:01] became a new book it didn't take him out
[1:14:04] of the scripture it just put up more in
[1:14:06] the scripture and it's the same things
[1:14:08] with us isn't it you know you first meet
[1:14:09] the Lord everything's wonderful
[1:14:11] but even you you don't know what you're
[1:14:13] really cool to be you just glad you're
[1:14:16] saved
[1:14:17] and then and then God opens more
[1:14:18] promises he you know he stabilizes your
[1:14:20] walk shows you your pre dis there it
[1:14:22] shows you your inheritance you know and
[1:14:24] the word shows you your part of the word
[1:14:26] you don't know those things in the
[1:14:28] beginning but you as you walk with God
[1:14:30] he reveals himself and he reveals who
[1:14:33] you are in him I met I believe he's
[1:14:36] still doing that too for us so now we
[1:14:40] have but then what happens is the golden
[1:14:43] calf if you look at the original golden
[1:14:45] calf as when the people were too
[1:14:47] impatient when Moses was at Mount Sinai
[1:14:49] here was their prophet receiving the
[1:14:52] revelation of the word on the mountain
[1:14:53] they were waiting at the bottom of the
[1:14:55] mountain waiting for that revelations
[1:14:57] that come and they became impatient and
[1:14:59] they just turned them Aaron said Aaron
[1:15:01] just build us a God the image of that
[1:15:04] God was going to come down off the
[1:15:05] mountain in the form of the law right
[1:15:08] but then they were too impatient they
[1:15:10] said Aaron build us a build us a God and
[1:15:12] so instead of waiting for the revelation
[1:15:14] to come they built an image of what they
[1:15:17] thought that God looked like they took
[1:15:19] them out of Egypt and it's the same
[1:15:22] thing with people and this has been
[1:15:24] through since since the message has been
[1:15:26] here as people begin to catch revelation
[1:15:29] but instead of waiting for it to mature
[1:15:32] and coming to its fullness they begin to
[1:15:34] run with a partial revelation and they
[1:15:36] begin to build camps we've seen it they
[1:15:39] you know they they they built specialty
[1:15:42] doctrines and you've got to listen to
[1:15:43] this preacher and this preacher in this
[1:15:45] breach and if you don't listen to those
[1:15:46] preachers you know turn and you're not
[1:15:48] going to make it because you don't
[1:15:49] listen to them
[1:15:49] right and then what happens is and then
[1:15:53] people misunderstand what brother Brahim
[1:15:54] says like I'll ride this trail again and
[1:15:56] people think he's going to return this
[1:15:58] in these whole movements of return
[1:16:00] ministry and when he says I'm gonna raid
[1:16:01] this trial again it's God speaking first
[1:16:03] person through a man that the same Holy
[1:16:05] Ghost and the Prophet they say ministry
[1:16:07] would continue but now through a multi
[1:16:09] member bride he say well how do you find
[1:16:11] that in the scripture well David was
[1:16:12] there and and he was anointed and he
[1:16:15] cried out and what Psalm 23 or wherever
[1:16:17] does my god my god wise elfis akin me
[1:16:20] and here he was king and no doubt maybe
[1:16:23] the people around and we'll look him
[1:16:25] he's speaking this forth and they're
[1:16:27] thinking you're not forsaken David you
[1:16:30] know forsaken what
[1:16:31] you're forsaken but he was looking he
[1:16:33] was right on the cross at Calvary right
[1:16:36] he was speaking first person God was
[1:16:38] speaking first person through a man just
[1:16:41] like when Moses went down spoke to
[1:16:43] Pharaoh said let my people go they were
[1:16:45] God's people God was speaking through
[1:16:48] Moses right so when so when you're
[1:16:50] saying you know I'm gonna ride this ride
[1:16:53] this trolley right whoa boy
[1:16:55] ride this trail again you know brother
[1:16:59] brand see sometimes take what I mean and
[1:17:00] not what I say I'll ride this trail
[1:17:03] again that was the Holy Ghost saying the
[1:17:06] same ministries going to continue on and
[1:17:08] people saying oh he's gonna race from
[1:17:10] the deed he's gonna preach some more
[1:17:11] things he's going to tie up the loose
[1:17:12] ends it certainly be tied up here but
[1:17:15] sure he's gonna race but it's coming
[1:17:16] with the dead in Christ yeah then we're
[1:17:19] gonna be gone right by people but what
[1:17:22] happens is people take quotes mate and
[1:17:23] they make a carnal misunderstanding and
[1:17:25] then people are waiting for something
[1:17:27] and it's happening right now you know
[1:17:30] just like the 10th version you know when
[1:17:32] when brother Brown was trying to you
[1:17:34] know the first two parts of that vision
[1:17:36] was was him trying to put a lay through
[1:17:37] a child shoe and then also with the
[1:17:39] fishing and then he talks about the
[1:17:41] teens and people think it's gonna be a
[1:17:43] literal tinters literally going to
[1:17:44] happen the first three parts of the
[1:17:45] vision were in literal that's symbolic
[1:17:47] just like the third one it's symbolic
[1:17:49] remember the mystery you know his
[1:17:51] tabernacle you know that mystery is now
[1:17:53] when the wood comes open and it changes
[1:17:56] your life a member it cannot be imitated
[1:17:58] it cannot be you know manufactured it's
[1:18:01] a God's doing it you know the other
[1:18:03] people came into that wooden place in
[1:18:05] the tent and there was a reporter or
[1:18:08] someone waiting on the other side
[1:18:09] because they win and came out
[1:18:10] well and and and they're trying to ask
[1:18:13] them what happened to you they said I
[1:18:14] don't know but now I'm not a no
[1:18:16] more right it's the same thing when the
[1:18:18] word strikes your heart where once
[1:18:19] virtually crippled maybe on a cot
[1:18:21] whatever were God brought us into his
[1:18:23] presence right and then we went out of
[1:18:25] that after that union with Christ we
[1:18:27] walk can't people say what happened to
[1:18:28] you you say I don't know I can try and
[1:18:30] describe it you know it was incredible I
[1:18:32] met God he's alive as woods real he's
[1:18:34] not in the grave no more this message is
[1:18:36] real it's part of the scripture it's a
[1:18:38] revelation of God about can't describe
[1:18:41] to you really what happened
[1:18:42] because you have to experience it
[1:18:43] yourself right so it's not a but the
[1:18:46] thing is people take those things what
[1:18:49] do they do they build a calf and that's
[1:18:53] why you see specialty ministries have
[1:18:55] risen up and they've fallen apart you've
[1:18:59] seen it why because all man-made schemes
[1:19:02] have to come to an end
[1:19:03] remember this message brother but even
[1:19:05] even you know eight messengers I'm sure
[1:19:08] just you know it's like you could have a
[1:19:10] convention of them all they think
[1:19:13] they're the eighth one and they take it
[1:19:14] quote from the seventh seal brother and
[1:19:16] say well maybe I'm just building a
[1:19:17] platform for that main one to come and
[1:19:20] people take that and say Here I am and
[1:19:22] they and they and they form a following
[1:19:24] but actually the the platform we built
[1:19:26] for that main one to come was Christ
[1:19:28] themselves who did who did put it alight
[1:19:31] I mean who did John the Baptist
[1:19:32] introduce Jesus Christ the word amen and
[1:19:35] of a prophet coming the spirit of Elijah
[1:19:36] to introduce them for the scene coming
[1:19:38] who will he introduced us to Jesus
[1:19:39] Christ the word has he not hallelujah
[1:19:44] I think people take that quite say Here
[1:19:46] I am this is me and they've got to
[1:19:48] change to change the message to make it
[1:19:50] a special revelation you say well the
[1:19:53] scripture I mean you know even as the
[1:19:54] Bible says that the scripture is not a
[1:19:56] private interpretation and bet then you
[1:19:59] read the next verse why because God
[1:20:00] moved on the prophets so it's not man's
[1:20:02] idea devising what it means no God just
[1:20:04] speaks for through a prophecies this is
[1:20:06] my word hallelujah so what have they
[1:20:10] done people have built golden cow well
[1:20:12] in order to hold on to people to
[1:20:16] engineer a following you know I don't
[1:20:19] care if I'm not even a footnote in
[1:20:21] history
[1:20:21] I would rather I wouldn't stand here
[1:20:24] myself I'll be real honest I don't care
[1:20:28] we want to meet him that's the important
[1:20:31] thing
[1:20:32] doesn't matter about the ministry or who
[1:20:34] we have a great big whatever who cares
[1:20:36] about that not interested in that and
[1:20:37] said us and God have a true personal
[1:20:40] relationship brother then comes the end
[1:20:41] of the church age book he says if this
[1:20:43] one thing that one thing I've decide is
[1:20:45] that man and God would need to have a
[1:20:46] true spiritual relationship that was the
[1:20:49] summation of the whole church age but
[1:20:51] this is what his desire was he says I
[1:20:53] want you to follow me or whatever
[1:20:55] that's the
[1:20:55] thing I want I mean and that's the one
[1:20:58] thing we want I mean that God and man
[1:21:02] would have a true spiritual relationship
[1:21:03] that if this place is no more you still
[1:21:06] a believer hallelujah
[1:21:08] I mean cuz remember this this church
[1:21:11] won't get you in a rapture you're not
[1:21:13] gonna get all but I went to church on
[1:21:15] Sunday here that's got nothing to do
[1:21:16] with it it's cuz you know him if you
[1:21:19] know him you'll get there
[1:21:20] a means a people of built calves they've
[1:21:27] taken the word they've taken Scripture
[1:21:29] they've taken the message and they've
[1:21:31] meshed it together to fit their own ends
[1:21:34] and the built in a golden calf and they
[1:21:37] say this is where God is today God is in
[1:21:39] his word God is in his word we're
[1:21:42] following the word amen
[1:21:46] now but then now so and this is what
[1:21:53] people have done this is this is
[1:21:54] basically the sages history right now
[1:21:58] this is what's happened but I want you
[1:22:02] to if we can I have it here the most
[1:22:06] glorious thing happens though when
[1:22:10] Jeroboam builds these altars I really
[1:22:15] pray I have it here as it causes some
[1:22:19] people to leave and return to Jerusalem
[1:22:29] it's got a second chronicles 11 and then
[1:22:32] we'll talk about Jerusalem seeing
[1:22:37] Chronicles 11 in 13 I don't have it on
[1:22:38] the on the slides scene chronicles
[1:22:49] living in 13 Sam in when you were there
[1:22:58] remember this is just what's happened
[1:23:00] this man's built these golden calves
[1:23:01] he's he's put in his own pre sees you
[1:23:04] know stopping the people worship God as
[1:23:07] was ordained in that hour but whenever
[1:23:09] the enemy raises something up it can't
[1:23:11] hold the true seed of God it can't hold
[1:23:15] them they have to get out of it and they
[1:23:17] will if they haven't already
[1:23:19] second chronicles 11 and 13 and the
[1:23:23] priests and the Levites that were all in
[1:23:26] all Israel this is after he's built the
[1:23:28] golden calves and the priests and the
[1:23:29] Levites that were all were in all
[1:23:32] Jerusalem resorted to him out of all the
[1:23:35] coasts that's the rear bomb this is in
[1:23:37] Jerusalem for the Levites left their
[1:23:40] suburbs and their possession and came to
[1:23:42] Judah and Jerusalem for Jeroboam and his
[1:23:45] sons cast them off from executing the
[1:23:48] priests office under the Lord and he
[1:23:50] ordained him priests for the high places
[1:23:52] and for the Devils and for the calves in
[1:23:54] which he had made and after them and
[1:23:57] after them out of all the tribes of
[1:23:59] Judah such as set their hearts to seek
[1:24:01] the Lord their God of Israel came to
[1:24:03] Jerusalem to sacrifice under the Lord
[1:24:06] God of their fathers so here it is now
[1:24:08] is that that that Jeroboam kicks them
[1:24:11] out and then and it's in their heart
[1:24:13] they want to seek the Lord God of their
[1:24:15] fathers and whether they return to
[1:24:17] Jerusalem I mean to where true spiritual
[1:24:20] worship is taking place so now there's a
[1:24:22] gathering member we are kings and
[1:24:25] priests of God we're a spiritual
[1:24:26] priesthood right so we're talking about
[1:24:28] the Levites here is talking about the
[1:24:29] bride now people have risen up these
[1:24:31] golden cows within the message it causes
[1:24:34] the true believer to leave it and they
[1:24:36] actually return now to where God really
[1:24:38] is in his undefiled word
[1:24:40] I mean so here they are they have left
[1:24:42] left the rest of Israel and they've
[1:24:44] gathered now to Jerusalem because that's
[1:24:47] where the worship that's what God put
[1:24:49] his name at that time hallelujah to set
[1:24:52] their hearts to seek the Lord their God
[1:24:54] some seek the Lord God of Israel come to
[1:24:57] Jerusalem to sacrifice under the Lord
[1:24:59] God of their fathers now as we read in
[1:25:01] Deuteronomy God said I'm only gonna I'm
[1:25:05] gonna place I'm gonna you're gonna
[1:25:07] sacrifice the Passover in a place where
[1:25:11] the Lord shall choose to place his name
[1:25:15] now we understand that this gate he says
[1:25:18] you won't worship anywhere but there's
[1:25:19] this one place that you must worship and
[1:25:22] as as brother Brown brings it out and
[1:25:24] the message guys provide a place of
[1:25:26] worship he would say that you know we
[1:25:27] know Jesus is the door and and then you
[1:25:32] know Jesus said I come in my father's
[1:25:34] name and you received me not so what was
[1:25:37] the father's name there's actually Jesus
[1:25:39] Christ right so he came in his father's
[1:25:42] name and so now the name so so what God
[1:25:47] put his name is in his son now I trust
[1:25:50] this means something to you because you
[1:25:51] know if God is seeking people to worship
[1:25:54] Him spirit and in truth he's gonna take
[1:25:56] them to where he wants worship to be
[1:25:58] done and he's not just going to place
[1:26:00] the meat to dwell for a season but
[1:26:02] they're going to be sealed in there
[1:26:03] they're gonna be in the gate hallelujah
[1:26:06] so now so these these Levites because of
[1:26:13] the Golden Calf because of Jeroboam son
[1:26:16] they left and they begin to wander they
[1:26:20] begin to walk back to Jerusalem where
[1:26:22] worship really was and that's what
[1:26:24] happens with the true believers
[1:26:26] something funny comes in and if they're
[1:26:28] not under the influence that spirit
[1:26:29] straight away they'll say something's
[1:26:30] not right here and they'll begin to seek
[1:26:32] God and His Word to see if it's true or
[1:26:34] not
[1:26:35] hallelujah but remember even if those
[1:26:37] are under that delusion they can come
[1:26:38] out of it
[1:26:39] amen he says not the so so he sees here
[1:26:44] so not the Methodists word the Baptist
[1:26:46] word remember if is if there was any
[1:26:49] left over and the sacrifice had to be
[1:26:51] burned before morning this is the
[1:26:53] sacrifice given cause to
[1:26:54] tomorrow's another age that's right
[1:26:56] Exodus it's true a symbol type of the
[1:26:58] sacrifice at the door he says I will
[1:27:02] make one place don't you worship me in
[1:27:04] in every door that I'll give you but
[1:27:06] there's one door and then that door I
[1:27:07] put my name and where the Lord put his
[1:27:09] name that's the place that God will
[1:27:11] receive your sacrifice we've made all
[1:27:14] kinds of doors but God made a door God
[1:27:16] made a door and that door was Saint John
[1:27:18] the tenth chapter Jesus is I am that
[1:27:19] dawn God put his name in Jesus do you
[1:27:22] believe it here was the Son of God every
[1:27:24] Sun comes in his father's name he said I
[1:27:26] come in my father's name you received me
[1:27:28] not I come in my father's name he you
[1:27:30] come in your father's name Jesus came in
[1:27:32] his father's name so his father's name
[1:27:34] is Jesus that's exactly because he came
[1:27:38] in his father's name and you received me
[1:27:39] not another will come and him will you
[1:27:42] receive you'll take your denominations
[1:27:44] and go on with them the Methodists say
[1:27:46] it's an our church the Baptist's say I'm
[1:27:49] seers and the Pentecostals and nurse and
[1:27:50] the Presbyterians and this but he said
[1:27:52] I'll meet you I'll meet them in one
[1:27:54] place the place I put my name that's in
[1:27:56] Jesus Christ that's where God put his
[1:27:58] name that's the only place he'll meet
[1:28:00] you and that's in Christ as the word see
[1:28:03] the same yesterday it's growed from the
[1:28:05] feet the thighs and now it's in the head
[1:28:07] fixing to go manifesting the full
[1:28:09] measure of the bride as same as the
[1:28:12] groom that's the modern events made
[1:28:14] clear by prophecy he says and and God's
[1:28:16] chosen place of worship Romans 8:1 is
[1:28:18] now therefore no condemnation to them
[1:28:20] that are in Christ Jesus that walk not
[1:28:22] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:28:23] that's the gospel we can different upon
[1:28:26] creeds we can different upon man-made
[1:28:28] theories you can go to a Methodist
[1:28:30] Church you have to be a Methodist a
[1:28:32] Baptist a Baptist the Catholic a
[1:28:33] Catholic but when once you're baptized
[1:28:35] into Christ and become a member of his
[1:28:37] body there's no difference as the middle
[1:28:39] walls of partition is torn down and
[1:28:41] you're free because you're in Christ
[1:28:42] Jesus and you worship God in spirit and
[1:28:45] in truth when you're in Christ Jesus
[1:28:46] that's God's plan for you to worship Him
[1:28:49] in Christ Jesus now no church
[1:28:50] denomination has claims this no one can
[1:28:53] claim that how dare you make such claims
[1:28:55] to do such a thing would be an
[1:28:56] antichrist spirit be taking away from
[1:28:58] Christ to take from him you cannot do
[1:29:00] that Christ is the only place that God
[1:29:02] meets the worshipers they say today I
[1:29:05] I'll have people tell me a man
[1:29:08] me not long ago and Belmont Texas his
[1:29:10] brother Brett he said mr. Branum if your
[1:29:12] name is not on our church book you
[1:29:14] cannot go to him and what do people say
[1:29:17] today if you don't see it the way I'm
[1:29:19] seeing it you're lost you've got to have
[1:29:21] my understanding of the open would
[1:29:22] otherwise you're not gonna make it
[1:29:25] remember it's who you know it's not what
[1:29:27] you know if you remember when the Spirit
[1:29:30] of Truth will come here loogey Legion
[1:29:32] guide you into all truth so when the
[1:29:34] spirit truth comes to you personally he
[1:29:36] will lead you and guide you into all
[1:29:38] truth that's God now guiding you through
[1:29:40] his word that you'll have an
[1:29:41] understanding but it's him guiding you
[1:29:44] throat say Amen you say well I don't you
[1:29:49] don't see it my way that's fine you know
[1:29:51] it's like you know wheat DC wheat never
[1:29:55] matures exactly the same speed together
[1:29:58] he's ever seen wheat grower or corn or
[1:30:01] whatever it is it's never just now one
[1:30:03] day everything's just the same know that
[1:30:05] some of the fields are celibate green so
[1:30:07] it matures a bit quicker than the other
[1:30:09] but they all come to harvest condition
[1:30:12] they all come as long as there's life in
[1:30:16] that wheat plant right it will come to
[1:30:18] harvest condition right surface and then
[1:30:21] so well what should revelation do for us
[1:30:23] revelation should give us the character
[1:30:25] of Christ man but Moses received the
[1:30:27] Lord Sinai as a revelation and it made
[1:30:30] him the meekest man in all the earth
[1:30:31] remember he was raised in Pharaoh's
[1:30:33] Palace do you think he would have been a
[1:30:35] meek man in Pharaoh's Palace they
[1:30:37] considered themselves gods he would have
[1:30:40] walked on I'm Moses son of whoever you
[1:30:45] know he would have walked around like
[1:30:46] you know his servants were just mere
[1:30:48] mortals this he wouldn't have had that
[1:30:51] kind of personality being the meekest
[1:30:53] man in all the earth but that being meek
[1:30:55] was an attribute of Christ's character
[1:30:57] and when he received the laura's
[1:30:59] revelation it made a meek the scribes
[1:31:02] and Pharisees they were reading the same
[1:31:04] law but because it was a learned thing
[1:31:06] not a revelation they were proud
[1:31:07] arrogant people and you see the same
[1:31:09] thing even within the message see it's
[1:31:11] the character that's formed that matters
[1:31:13] the only thing you're gonna take with
[1:31:14] you is his character you're not going to
[1:31:16] take nothing else so how do you know
[1:31:18] you're receiving
[1:31:19] halation you should be be more like
[1:31:21] Christ everyday right because as as a
[1:31:24] bit as the word becomes a revelation to
[1:31:26] you it manifests as character in your
[1:31:28] life amen so Moses because of Revelation
[1:31:35] became the meekest man in all the earth
[1:31:38] now hallelujah
[1:31:43] he says what'd you ever think of that
[1:31:46] don't you believe such a thing as that
[1:31:48] you think you have to belong to that
[1:31:49] certain church you cannot go to heaven
[1:31:51] that's wrong to believe that is
[1:31:53] Antichrist I'll say this if you believe
[1:31:54] such a spirit you're lost that's a good
[1:31:56] sign you're lost because it's taking
[1:31:58] away from what God did God never put his
[1:32:00] name in any church he puts it in his son
[1:32:02] Christ Jesus and when he and his son
[1:32:04] become one that's a genuine place of
[1:32:06] worship so when you and Christ become
[1:32:08] one that's a genuine place of worship no
[1:32:10] other foundations is laid no other Rock
[1:32:12] on Christ the solid rock I stand all
[1:32:14] other ground is sinking Sam what is the
[1:32:16] crisis hard rock the Word of God honors
[1:32:19] word I stand all other all other the
[1:32:21] sinking sand man's ideas man's opinion I
[1:32:24] don't care about opinion I don't care
[1:32:25] about my own opinion I only care about
[1:32:28] what God has vindicated in the South
[1:32:29] that's what matters because if God has
[1:32:32] backed it up boy I'll get on that side
[1:32:34] Lou yeah member of corn days and had any
[1:32:37] kind of spiritual sense they would have
[1:32:38] recognized God is with Moses I'm going
[1:32:40] to follow him and it's the same thing
[1:32:42] with Joshua you know people had any
[1:32:43] spiritual sense that say well God is
[1:32:45] what this man is he was with Moses is
[1:32:47] with Joshua I'm following this man and
[1:32:49] why why should I follow this man it's
[1:32:51] because he is here to fulfill the Word
[1:32:53] of God the places in our inheritance
[1:32:55] rights not just to follow up ministry
[1:32:58] for the sacred knows that you would be
[1:32:59] placed in your spiritual inheritance and
[1:33:01] this is why this message is so vital
[1:33:03] because it's an adoption message I mean
[1:33:05] it places you and the body of Christ
[1:33:07] where you're a day to be and it's not
[1:33:09] man's ideas us formulating this person
[1:33:12] should do this this person should do
[1:33:13] this now that's man's government and if
[1:33:15] it's man's government it will fail right
[1:33:18] but if it's God's work placing the
[1:33:20] people that's how it should be
[1:33:23] amen see no other place that a man can
[1:33:29] find to worship God that God will speak
[1:33:31] back to them No
[1:33:33] but in Christ Jesus that's the only
[1:33:35] place the only place that God chose to
[1:33:37] put his name and the only place that he
[1:33:39] meets men to worship you're lost to
[1:33:41] believe anything else
[1:33:42] he says notice he says notice all seven
[1:33:47] Jewish feasts are kept in the same place
[1:33:50] they never kept one feast here for the
[1:33:52] Methodists over here for the Baptist's
[1:33:54] over here for the Presbyterian over here
[1:33:56] for the Catholic and one for the
[1:33:57] Protestant all seven feasts will be kept
[1:33:59] in the same place it's a very beautiful
[1:34:01] type here we just went through the seven
[1:34:03] churches is going to show that God kept
[1:34:06] all seven Church ages and the word for
[1:34:09] each church age produced a part of the
[1:34:11] word and whenever they produced it they
[1:34:12] saw the light just like people who first
[1:34:14] discovered the baptized in Jesus name
[1:34:16] what did they do they made a
[1:34:18] denomination out of it and it died right
[1:34:20] there then God moves right out into
[1:34:22] somebody else he will not stay in one of
[1:34:24] those creeds and dogmas he has nothing
[1:34:27] to do that there's nothing perverted
[1:34:28] about God God's Word is holy and
[1:34:31] adulterated Christ as God send a point
[1:34:33] of worship He is God all seven feasts
[1:34:36] must be kept in this one place you
[1:34:38] couldn't keep the feasts in any other
[1:34:39] place but them seven places the seven I
[1:34:42] mean I mean I mean the seven feasts the
[1:34:44] year must be kept in one place therefore
[1:34:46] the seventh church ages had to come from
[1:34:48] one single place that was Christ
[1:34:51] speaking all seven Church ages that's
[1:34:53] exactly right
[1:34:54] I mean type of the seven church age as
[1:34:56] they but they made denominations out of
[1:34:58] it
[1:34:59] now let's know what let's just stop it
[1:35:02] how does the nomination form man tries
[1:35:05] to hold on to truth and they make a
[1:35:07] man-made government and rules to
[1:35:09] legislate the church that's how the
[1:35:11] denomination has formed now brother
[1:35:13] Graham says this message will never
[1:35:15] denominator but I'll tell you people
[1:35:16] have tried people have tried they've
[1:35:20] tried to make people apostles in the end
[1:35:22] and instead of being a god-given apostle
[1:35:24] which is one sent a missionary as an
[1:35:26] apostle they place an apostle above the
[1:35:28] rest of the fivefold ministry and they
[1:35:30] say well this person as is prophet now
[1:35:32] after the you know yeah you know after
[1:35:34] brother Bramley if they do all these
[1:35:35] kind of things lifting up man out of
[1:35:37] their god-given position but member the
[1:35:39] Prophet said that the bride will under
[1:35:42] her messenger will be the final voice of
[1:35:44] the final age so
[1:35:45] we now under this word will be the final
[1:35:48] voice of the final age so now God will
[1:35:50] come and live in his bride and she will
[1:35:53] be the mouthpiece of God once again as
[1:35:55] she was of the day of Pentecost amen so
[1:35:59] it's not man-made government that we're
[1:36:01] gonna have some kind of system you know
[1:36:02] no it's not man's system it's God
[1:36:05] ordained pattern in his word that we
[1:36:07] follow amen you say well you know and
[1:36:11] church order as their pattern so we need
[1:36:13] these things but when it comes to man
[1:36:15] ruling the bride that's when you see
[1:36:18] ministries fall is because God will not
[1:36:21] have his bride manhandled by anyone he's
[1:36:24] jealous god I mean he cares about us he
[1:36:27] you know if someone raised up thinking
[1:36:28] they have it all and they're the one
[1:36:29] that's going to run the signal they're
[1:36:31] gone because God will get his people out
[1:36:35] now let's look at another type now I'm
[1:36:38] not speaking about any particularly any
[1:36:40] one place anywhere I'm just showing you
[1:36:41] in this you know in the word what's
[1:36:43] happened now let's look at another type
[1:36:44] while we're along here that's the type
[1:36:46] of the Passover for foreshadow Jesus you
[1:36:49] notice here the sacrifice of blood by
[1:36:51] death the sacrifice of blood was the
[1:36:53] place that foreshadow Christ can a
[1:36:55] denomination bleed could you think of a
[1:36:57] church bleeding a denomination bleeding
[1:36:59] certainly not had taken blood to bleed
[1:37:02] from a life and the life here Jesus
[1:37:05] comes in view by the lamb the lamb was a
[1:37:07] type of Christ and foreshadow Christ
[1:37:09] because he was the Lamb of God that John
[1:37:12] introduced that takes away the sin of
[1:37:14] the world
[1:37:14] we find Jesus coming into view here in
[1:37:17] Exodus the twelfth chapter notice it was
[1:37:19] the only place death could not strike
[1:37:21] when death was about to strike the land
[1:37:23] there had to be a certain place all from
[1:37:26] under this died only one place now
[1:37:29] doesn't mean it was one house but there
[1:37:30] was one place that's where the lamb was
[1:37:33] killed where the lambs blood was the
[1:37:35] death angel could not strike because it
[1:37:38] was the one place God had put his name
[1:37:40] and the lamb was named back there in the
[1:37:42] beginning of lamb notice it was the one
[1:37:44] place he could not strike and now the
[1:37:46] same as today and the only place that
[1:37:48] spiritual death cannot strike that's the
[1:37:50] word death cannot strike the word
[1:37:52] because it's a living Word of God amen
[1:37:55] if you're under the word amen death
[1:37:56] can't strike you
[1:37:58] my brother had said about the token you
[1:37:59] ought to get under the message get out
[1:38:01] of the token maybe don't just talk about
[1:38:03] it don't just debate it get under it
[1:38:06] amen but when you put a Creed into it
[1:38:08] the word its moves out of itself out to
[1:38:11] itself it'll separate like oil from
[1:38:13] water you cannot mix it together
[1:38:15] therefore you see when the Creed comes
[1:38:17] comes into a denomination they all go
[1:38:20] after the Creed and the word dies out
[1:38:22] and goes on with somebody else and
[1:38:23] increases it more picks up a momentum it
[1:38:26] goes from justification sanctification
[1:38:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost and it goes
[1:38:30] out into the grain do you see the path
[1:38:32] God has trod bringing his name all the
[1:38:35] time right down the same way because he
[1:38:37] is the word notice it can't die the word
[1:38:39] of life can't die
[1:38:41] notice how perfect now that the death
[1:38:43] angel was not forbidden to strike
[1:38:45] egypt's great intellectual I mean
[1:38:48] intellectual people it wasn't forbidden
[1:38:49] to strike it scared lands its great
[1:38:52] buildings that's Pharaoh's or the
[1:38:53] priests of the land the angel was not
[1:38:55] forbidden to strike it could strike any
[1:38:56] building any place anybody but it could
[1:38:59] not strike where the lamb was death
[1:39:01] cannot strike with us provided place of
[1:39:03] God is and that is in the lamb notice
[1:39:06] not even see he was see he see he was
[1:39:11] not even forbidden to strike Israel or
[1:39:13] its Hebrew priests or any of their
[1:39:14] denominations but those under the blood
[1:39:17] he could not strike now as I see it in
[1:39:20] the beginning the golden curves are man
[1:39:24] taking part of the word and making a god
[1:39:26] now I don't have time to do it but but
[1:39:29] we've gone through it maybe a few years
[1:39:31] I think we're downstairs that Egypt they
[1:39:34] took the children living with God and
[1:39:35] you can read about it in Hebrews and it
[1:39:37] took the attributes of God and made them
[1:39:40] God's said as a God of life is the god
[1:39:43] of fertility god of nature all the
[1:39:45] different gods of Egypt actually
[1:39:46] attributes of God that have been taken
[1:39:48] from him and made as a separate God you
[1:39:52] go and and you can see that through all
[1:39:53] of you know all the ancient religions
[1:39:55] they take a part of God and they make an
[1:39:58] idol out of that part of him right and
[1:40:00] that's what people have done that's what
[1:40:02] Jeroboam essentially did is he took a
[1:40:04] part of the word and made a golden calf
[1:40:07] took a part of the word that's what
[1:40:09] happened people have risen up with
[1:40:10] whether partial River
[1:40:12] and they've made a golden calf out of it
[1:40:14] and they say this is the message of the
[1:40:17] hour the whole message is the word I
[1:40:19] mean and we don't add or take away it's
[1:40:22] it's the whole word
[1:40:23] remember when Joshua was commanded when
[1:40:25] he was commissioned in Joshua 1 he was
[1:40:28] told to meditate upon the whole Word of
[1:40:29] God and you'll be successful God and say
[1:40:31] no meditate more on the feasts or
[1:40:33] meditate more on me you know dietary
[1:40:36] laws he said just take the whole word
[1:40:37] take the whole Word of God and you'll be
[1:40:40] successful don't add to it don't
[1:40:41] emphasize or even diminish how the
[1:40:43] points just take the whole thing and
[1:40:45] you'll be successful even let's go to
[1:40:48] Judah honor me
[1:40:50] I believe this you Terada me chapter 4
[1:40:58] and we're here in verse 1 and I don't
[1:41:00] have that up there
[1:41:13] is now therefore hearken or Israel under
[1:41:15] the statutes and under the judgments
[1:41:16] which I teach you for to do them that
[1:41:19] you may live and go in and possess the
[1:41:20] land was the Lord God of your father's
[1:41:22] giveth you you shall not add unto the
[1:41:25] word which I command neither shall ye
[1:41:28] diminish aught from it that ye may keep
[1:41:31] the commandments of the Lord your God
[1:41:33] which I commanded you now this word
[1:41:37] diminish it actually means to scrape off
[1:41:41] by implication to shave remove to listen
[1:41:44] or to withhold to keep back to restrain
[1:41:48] to make small to withdraw see if it is a
[1:41:52] small diminution it's just like scraping
[1:41:53] off like you know you take a piece of
[1:41:55] toast you've burnt it you scrape off the
[1:41:57] burnt but you've actually diminished
[1:41:58] that toast because you've scraped off a
[1:42:01] bit of it you've taken a piece of that
[1:42:02] away we don't want to diminish any of
[1:42:05] this word it's all important it's all
[1:42:09] important from from how the family
[1:42:11] should be to the revelation of the
[1:42:13] seventh seal to the third pull
[1:42:14] everything and if you meet the author of
[1:42:17] the word it's all connected
[1:42:18] so the doctrine is not all separate
[1:42:21] things it's actually a person being
[1:42:23] formed right it's actually a person
[1:42:25] being formed in you when you actually
[1:42:27] meet the author of the book you'll see
[1:42:29] if it's water baptism is how we should
[1:42:31] treat each other how we should be in our
[1:42:33] jobs how we should you know be fathers
[1:42:35] mothers whatever it is you know how we
[1:42:37] should dress the seven church age is the
[1:42:39] seven trumpets the seven vials the seven
[1:42:41] seals church or whatever maybe you'll
[1:42:43] see it's actually a person it's not just
[1:42:46] an idea or a doctrine so we don't want
[1:42:50] to diminish anything Jeroboam perverted
[1:42:53] part of the word and said you don't need
[1:42:55] to go to Jerusalem to worship but we're
[1:42:57] in Jerusalem was the temple and in the
[1:43:00] end the temple was the Ark and over the
[1:43:04] ark was the presence of God so in that
[1:43:06] temple was the word the Ark represents
[1:43:08] the word and God's presence was above
[1:43:10] that word and people could go to that
[1:43:12] temple they could worship God they knew
[1:43:13] Jehovah God was there
[1:43:15] so it wasn't vain worship wasn't just
[1:43:17] man's enthusiasm was actually God was
[1:43:19] there to worship hallelujah and it's the
[1:43:22] same thing now remember God is in his
[1:43:23] word we don't need to go to Jerusalem to
[1:43:25] worship we don't need
[1:43:26] need to go to Jeffersonville or anywhere
[1:43:28] else I mean God is in his word
[1:43:30] hallelujah but remember if people put a
[1:43:32] golden calf in front of you they say you
[1:43:34] don't need to worship like that you
[1:43:35] don't need to know God for yourself you
[1:43:37] just need to quote this and say this and
[1:43:39] be like this you can say that's a golden
[1:43:40] calf thing you just got to conform to
[1:43:43] this just be like us know you've got to
[1:43:44] meet him amen any of it
[1:43:47] and that is God if you're really in
[1:43:50] Christ you're in God's provide a place
[1:43:53] of worship and the death angel can't
[1:43:55] strike we're lifers I mean with the
[1:44:00] Lammers can't strike it that's why these
[1:44:04] priests and these Levites they were
[1:44:06] thrust out of their places
[1:44:08] Jeroboam said get out of here you're not
[1:44:10] part of this why won't you be like us
[1:44:13] get out of here and they said we're
[1:44:15] gonna return we're gonna return to
[1:44:17] Jerusalem
[1:44:18] we were once scattered out among the
[1:44:20] people as we are ordained to be but now
[1:44:22] there's a call back come back hallelujah
[1:44:25] and then the bride has been called back
[1:44:26] to the true Word of God sure people may
[1:44:29] have built Cavs and had all kinds of
[1:44:30] isms and schisms and the message but
[1:44:33] there's a people that have come back to
[1:44:34] the true Word of God I mean more than
[1:44:36] just a few quotes to suit people's ideas
[1:44:39] but have come back to the Living God
[1:44:40] who manifests himself in reality I mean
[1:44:43] come back to a true Pentecost I mean
[1:44:45] come back to the true book of Acts with
[1:44:47] true God hallelujah that the same God
[1:44:49] the Prophet knew a min the bride knows
[1:44:52] how lujah Amen you say well we should be
[1:44:56] the most happiest people in all the
[1:44:58] world I'm not talking when I'm saying
[1:45:00] that go make a Drusilla talking about
[1:45:01] these four walls I said it's not coming
[1:45:03] to a church it's knowing him knowing him
[1:45:06] and his word amen you can yo I was so
[1:45:08] simple when I know when when gob was
[1:45:10] dear with me I thought well if he's
[1:45:11] alive I could meet him that was my you
[1:45:14] know simple maybe I'm too simple but you
[1:45:16] know and I still I still believe he's
[1:45:19] still alive you can still meet him I
[1:45:21] mean that that the same God the Apostles
[1:45:24] knew you could know Amen that you can
[1:45:27] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[1:45:28] member the father of seeking such to
[1:45:30] worship Him in that fashion so he's
[1:45:32] actually seeking you so I want you to
[1:45:34] come worship me in spirit and truth
[1:45:36] hallelujah I'm gonna leave it there
[1:45:42] never ever ever ever let anything change
[1:45:45] this word to you if it's me if it's
[1:45:51] anyone never ever let it happen
[1:45:53] stick with it stick with the scripture
[1:45:56] stick with this message follow up
[1:45:59] prayerfully amen
[1:46:01] whatever you do don't just change it
[1:46:03] well times have changed God don't change
[1:46:05] I mean the same God that gave the
[1:46:08] promises the same one that will fulfill
[1:46:09] the promise you just say Lord Here I am
[1:46:12] NOT on my own ability I don't want to
[1:46:14] make some golden calf put it in with my
[1:46:16] works I don't want to make it will out
[1:46:19] of my works and what I do if you I just
[1:46:21] do those things cuz I love you I mean
[1:46:23] it's not because I can merit anything or
[1:46:25] gain anything of my own self you know we
[1:46:28] should never have this opinion or god
[1:46:29] you owe me he don't owe us nothing he's
[1:46:32] God he's the one who made heavens and
[1:46:35] earth the reason we have life in our
[1:46:36] bodies and we're still alive is because
[1:46:37] of him
[1:46:38] it's not because of us and I keep when I
[1:46:40] died and I work and all this things
[1:46:41] that's irrelevant
[1:46:42] the very reason we're alive is because
[1:46:44] he's allowed us to still be alive
[1:46:46] I mean the very reason that we're
[1:46:48] believers is not because of you it's
[1:46:49] because of him
[1:46:50] I mean year before the foundation that
[1:46:52] world he knew you'd be here and he
[1:46:53] sought you out doesn't matter if you
[1:46:55] came out of the world like myself you're
[1:46:57] raising the message they had to come a
[1:46:59] day where he met you when you hear from
[1:47:01] just a church for every say now I know
[1:47:02] it's alive now I know you're real holier
[1:47:05] and God found you me but God's grace is
[1:47:07] a divine influence upon the heart and
[1:47:09] its reflection in the life that is the
[1:47:11] Strong's definition of New Testament
[1:47:13] grace hallelujah so it's not you know
[1:47:16] I'm a believer because I I decided no
[1:47:19] the reason you decide is because God put
[1:47:21] on your heart to decide he gave you
[1:47:23] ability to choose him hallelujah you you
[1:47:27] take that thought of the cherubims all
[1:47:28] the way down through the scripture and
[1:47:30] the conclusion I come and say thank you
[1:47:32] God you allowed me to walk past them I
[1:47:34] mean because that influence that
[1:47:36] anointing that kept them away from the
[1:47:38] Tree of Life is now present to drive us
[1:47:40] to the Tree of Life
[1:47:41] hallelujah sure they thank God because
[1:47:43] some people are not ordained for eternal
[1:47:47] life the bride isn't everyone we treat
[1:47:50] Yvonne like they are right
[1:47:54] some people God actually says no you
[1:47:56] weren't am I thinking before the
[1:47:57] foundation of the world I'm not talking
[1:47:58] about anyone that's just the fact of the
[1:48:01] scripture it's not something to rejoice
[1:48:03] in I don't rejoice in that Lord why
[1:48:05] don't you just take everything everyone
[1:48:07] let them all come heavens big place
[1:48:10] where I have overcrowding I don't mean
[1:48:13] that as a joke I believe you bring you
[1:48:14] know but some people just not ordained
[1:48:16] to it we say well do you look down your
[1:48:19] nose at anyone no sir no way
[1:48:23] never ever I want them to come I'll then
[1:48:26] to rejoice I'll need to be free that's
[1:48:29] what I want but we should be saying
[1:48:31] thank you lord
[1:48:32] their flaming sword doesn't say no you
[1:48:34] cannon said we've been waiting for you
[1:48:37] you're on the book come and partake of
[1:48:40] the Tree of Life hallelujah God allowed
[1:48:44] you to come it wasn't ultimate it was
[1:48:48] him not you you just responded to the
[1:48:50] call so how can we ever make her how can
[1:48:53] we ever make a golden calf out of our
[1:48:55] own ability it's not it's not him that
[1:48:59] will earth or runneth it's God that
[1:49:00] shall Smurfs II so it's not him that
[1:49:02] willed I'm gonna be a Christian I'm
[1:49:04] gonna take this message to the four
[1:49:05] corners of the world no it's not him
[1:49:06] that willeth or even him that runneth
[1:49:08] it's got you know enthusiasm and goes
[1:49:10] for a while it's God that shows mercy
[1:49:14] his mercy hallelujah and how can we even
[1:49:19] make a golden calf out of the open word
[1:49:21] or part of it how can we do it how can
[1:49:25] we do it we say because Basie what's the
[1:49:26] Golden Calf this is your God
[1:49:30] full-stop this is it
[1:49:32] this is him there's no more add to it
[1:49:35] there's no more of him to unfold I'll
[1:49:36] say that's it how can we say oh now I
[1:49:39] know everything . Here I am I've arrived
[1:49:42] God will continue to give us revelation
[1:49:45] until these bodies change he will always
[1:49:49] unfold it we say well I've heard it all
[1:49:51] I've seen it all no you haven't why are
[1:49:52] you still here right if you are done
[1:49:56] you'd be gone why big will you say well
[1:49:59] why are we still here we need more
[1:50:01] character
[1:50:02] remember God the reason I still you know
[1:50:06] the reason we're still here is God is
[1:50:07] still forming ass into his image God
[1:50:11] knows how much character we need and
[1:50:12] he's you know cuz he's got a you know
[1:50:14] it's like anyone like a great artist
[1:50:17] they have in their mind like Hoffman who
[1:50:20] painted this
[1:50:21] with the rich young ruler he had in his
[1:50:23] mind a painting and then finally it
[1:50:27] became material it's like us Godhead
[1:50:30] before the foundation of wealth he
[1:50:32] thought of you at your best
[1:50:33] redeemed hallelujah overcome rejoicing
[1:50:36] this is now I'm gonna make that material
[1:50:40] and then we bought your grandparents are
[1:50:43] married all these things we come down
[1:50:44] come down that would give a certain
[1:50:46] thing a certain sound
[1:50:47] finally we're upon the earth as a baby
[1:50:49] that's not the image yet but it's going
[1:50:52] to become it it's gonna become material
[1:50:54] and then God's what he call it ordained
[1:50:57] time he meets you I mean your birth into
[1:51:00] the kingdom but spiritually you're a
[1:51:01] baby you still being made into the image
[1:51:04] because you're growing his life and he
[1:51:07] just adds revelation upon revelation
[1:51:09] build your character into him through
[1:51:10] suffering trials different things then
[1:51:12] finally he sees what I had in my mind
[1:51:14] like what half man had in his mind of
[1:51:17] the painting finally it's done there's
[1:51:19] an unveiling hallelujah done same thing
[1:51:26] with us so he can't say we've heard it
[1:51:29] all you may have read it all you may
[1:51:30] have heard it all but you haven't heard
[1:51:32] it all right just like this I've read
[1:51:36] this not boasting I've read through the
[1:51:38] Bible I trust you'll have read through
[1:51:39] the Bible at least once that doesn't
[1:51:42] mean I don't need to read it again you
[1:51:44] read the same thing I do ever saw that
[1:51:45] before you may have read it the week
[1:51:47] before the day before I never saw that's
[1:51:49] amazing but I read this last week why
[1:51:52] cause it's a it's a love letter it
[1:51:53] unfolds the heart of God to you you can
[1:51:56] have a greater relationship so God's
[1:51:58] chosen place of worship or paradox
[1:52:00] whatever message you said well I've
[1:52:01] heard there a thousand times but every
[1:52:03] thousand every time in that thousand
[1:52:05] something new happened it should have
[1:52:08] Amen to just keep walking that's why
[1:52:11] never ever put a full-stop
[1:52:14] just keep walking because what happens
[1:52:17] if you put a full-stop you've
[1:52:18] essentially I'll just say it made a calf
[1:52:21] made an idol this is who my God is just
[1:52:25] walk with Him they said the musicians
