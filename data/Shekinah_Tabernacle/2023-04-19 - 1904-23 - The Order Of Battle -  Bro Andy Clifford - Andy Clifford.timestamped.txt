[25:46] friends that we want saved
[25:49] I mean we wouldn't be human if we didn't
[25:51] want people saved right
[25:53] so these people that we face out in the
[25:55] world and we rub shoulders with and you

[36:01] where an atmosphere would come down and
[36:03] remove the fear and remove the doubts
[36:05] and the unbelief and the carnality of
[36:07] the people and then the word would go
[36:09] forth the ark would go forth and then

[40:56] and seven priests now notice priests and
[40:59] I want to talk a little bit about
[41:00] musicians you know and this isn't a
[41:02] musical thing but I just want to say
[41:04] that musicians are priests so don't
[41:06] belittle your position if you're called
[41:08] to an instrument you're called to a
[41:10] priesthood right a specific priesthood
[41:12] it's an access given anointing
[41:16] that's a priesthood so let me just let
[41:18] you sit down soon so shall bear before
[41:20] the ark seven trumpets of Ram's horns
[41:23] and the seventh day you shall come past
[41:25] the city seven times and the priests
[41:27] shall blow with the trumpets amen aren't
[41:30] you glad for the seventh day who
[41:31] believes we're in that day today

[41:37] shouting and a music a new song because
[41:39] why you've been given it
[41:41] God gave you a new song Amen when the
[41:43] seals open amen hallelujah and it shall
[41:46] come to pass that when they make a long
[41:48] blast which is a jubilee which with the
[41:51] Ram's Horn and when you hear the sound
[41:53] of the trumpet all the people shall
[41:55] shout hallelujah who's thankful for the
[41:58] shout of the king that's in the camp
[42:00] amen there's a shout of the king in this
[42:01] camp tonight
[42:03] oh my I just feel real good right now
[42:06] with a great shout not just any shout
[42:08] this is a great shout and I'll talk
[42:09] about the definition of that in a second
[42:11] it's very good and the wall of the city
[42:13] shall fall down flat everything that
[42:16] held Rahab and all her family and that
[42:18] sin was broken
[42:20] at the shout
[42:22] hallelujah and the wall of the city
[42:24] shall fall off and the people shall
[42:25] Ascend up every man straight before him
[42:28] turn not to the left to the right fight
[42:30] your enemy head on tonight don't deviate
[42:33] don't don't listen to your flesh that'll
[42:34] say don't go and enter and just pray and
[42:36] then get it done and then sorry
[42:39] and Joshua the son of none called the
[42:42] priests and said unto them take up the
[42:44] Ark of the Covenant and let seven
[42:46] priests bear seven trumpets of Ram's
[42:48] horns before the Ark of the Lord
[42:50] and he said unto the people pass on and
[42:53] come past the city and let him that is
[42:55] armed pass on before the Ark of the Lord
[42:58] see that there's the music then the word
[43:01] so we've done music and we've done word
[43:03] and now what are we waiting for and it
[43:05] shall come to pass when Joshua has
[43:07] spoken unto the people that the Prince
[43:09] Seven priests bearing the seven trumpets
[43:11] of Ram's horns passed on before the Lord
[43:13] and blew the trumpets and the Ark of the
[43:16] Covenant of the Lord followed them and
[43:18] the armed men went before the priest
[43:20] that blew with the trumpets and the
[43:22] reward which is the people from behind
[43:24] come after the ark
[43:26] the priests going on and blowing with
[43:28] the trumpets and Joshua had commanded
[43:31] the people saying you shall not shout
[43:33] nor make any noise with your voice and
[43:36] neither shall any word proceed out of
[43:38] your mouth until the day I bid you shout
[43:44] Oh Glory oh man that just makes me feel
[43:46] good Hallelujah then you shall Shout
[43:50] you may be seated
[43:52] the prophet says here the word led the
[43:54] way when it got to the Jordan
[43:56] she opened up and they went over now
[43:58] we're just going back a little bit but
[44:00] we're going to come back to where we
[44:01] were went over his first campaign he put
[44:04] things first things first he had a
[44:06] reason for that he had a reason because
[44:09] God had commissioned him stay with the
[44:12] word let the word do it I just like that
[44:15] tonight let the word do it and I feel
[44:17] very much inspired to read a bit of
[44:19] scripture tonight and so the Lord's
[44:20] inspired me to go through some
[44:22] scriptures about him fighting the battle
[44:24] for us and when I read it I just please
[44:27] let's have faith this let's just believe
[44:28] together let I want to stir your
[44:30] conscience I want to stir you up and
[44:32] when we read the word remember it's the
[44:35] word of God we're not just reading
[44:37] scriptures we're reading the heart of
[44:39] God and I've asked the Lord already that
[44:42] the same spirit that inspired that
[44:44] writer would speak through me tonight
[44:46] to as I read it because can you imagine
[44:48] the anointing yeah when those writers
[44:51] Paul and Isaiah and Ezekiel and David
[44:54] when they were under that inspiration
[44:57] and God came and they scribed what we're
[44:59] about to read I just pray Lord may you
[45:03] magnify the the the glory of the word
[45:07] because as we read this word you see
[45:09] what we're doing is we're letting the
[45:10] Levites carry the ark into battle
[45:14] so we've done music right we've done the
[45:16] worship we're bringing an atmosphere for
[45:18] war an atmosphere for deliverance what
[45:21] is Deliverance it's War an atmosphere
[45:24] for the Holy Ghost baptism what is that
[45:26] that's War it's an overthrowing of
[45:28] governments
[45:29] the Old Government gets overthrown in
[45:31] your life and a new government comes in
[45:34] it's a war the whole thing is centered
[45:37] around a battle and the battle is
[45:39] godwins and the devil loses Hallelujah
[45:41] so what we've done is the priests have
[45:43] been up here now now I know that sounds
[45:45] funny but the priests have been playing
[45:47] the piano and the priests have been
[45:49] playing the organ and the guitars you
[45:51] guys are priests or priestesses you
[45:52] could say is that a right thing to say I
[45:54] don't know but
[45:57] but you see what I mean there's a
[46:00] there's this Divine access gone forth
[46:02] and that you can see that there is an
[46:04] anointing on the people there's an
[46:06] anointing on the musicians because they
[46:07] realize that they've got an office that
[46:09] is treasured they've got an office that
[46:11] is Anointed there's part of this
[46:13] priesthood what is it for it's to create
[46:15] an atmosphere it's an atmosphere where
[46:18] the fear drops off the people so when
[46:20] you walk in the service you may have had
[46:21] an atmosphere of arguing or an
[46:23] atmosphere or something that you need
[46:25] that but as soon as that music started
[46:27] the atmosphere changed and you get into
[46:30] an atmosphere where the devil can get
[46:31] defeated
[46:32] amen and that's what it's all about
[46:33] that's why God would send the music
[46:35] before the ark he'd send the music
[46:37] because why because all the soldiers
[46:39] were scared
[46:40] they were scared they were real fearful
[46:42] can you imagine I would be scared oh my
[46:45] you think about it you've got a sword
[46:47] and you're going to fight these big
[46:48] hairy beasts of men that are going to
[46:51] try and kill you it's physical
[46:53] oh man it would have been pretty scary
[46:55] what did they need they needed something
[46:58] to change the atmosphere because no
[47:00] doubt when they were standing there and
[47:01] they're shaking ready and but there's a
[47:04] lot of bravado going on but then the
[47:06] music starts and all of a sudden yeah
[47:08] now it becomes spiritual
[47:11] now it's not just a physical War
[47:13] see a god Israel had to fight as a
[47:16] physical War but there was a spiritual
[47:18] Overture over the wall
[47:20] God had a spiritual dominance over it
[47:22] but still they physically fought it oh
[47:26] my but you see when that music started
[47:28] the priest would go you know no doubt
[47:30] the enemy did he probably just thought
[47:31] they were crazy
[47:33] like what are they doing and that would
[47:34] have disarm them a bit oh man these guys
[47:36] are just loose you know like and and so
[47:38] you know they would have gone okay well
[47:40] they'll let down there but then the
[47:41] Israelites under that anointing they
[47:43] realized Jehovah's here yeah There's A
[47:46] Change of Atmosphere I'm Ready for War
[47:48] now because something's changes Beyond
[47:50] me yeah yeah and there it is
[47:52] it's something that changes that's
[47:54] beyond you
[47:55] that's why we have music and that's why
[47:58] you know we spend a lot of investment
[48:00] not just Financial but time and and
[48:02] effort and heart and prayer into the
[48:04] music into the band into each instrument
[48:06] you know it's a Ministry and it's there
[48:09] to cast Devils you know David he casts
[48:11] Devils off
[48:14] that's a very powerful thing Elijah he
[48:16] was having a hard day so he got a
[48:18] Minstrel and change his atmosphere
[48:20] now there's time for war because God
[48:22] would step in and now he would speak he
[48:24] would release the word over the Earth
[48:26] through a prophet and then the battle
[48:27] would come and the dead would be raised
[48:29] and their sick would be healed and lies
[48:31] would be changed the vision of the Lord
[48:33] would be revealed yeah amen amen amen
[48:35] and so here we are changing the
[48:37] atmosphere and we've done it in faith
[48:40] I just want to encourage you when we
[48:41] come up here and we play we're playing
[48:43] in faith because we've got a there's a
[48:45] vision in mind the vision is Victory the
[48:48] vision is War and the devil's defeat and
[48:52] he'll try everything he can to hold on
[48:53] to his ground and squat in our land and
[48:55] try and keep things from us but he is
[48:58] finished
[48:59] he's done he's scared too you know that
[49:02] said that Jericho was straightly shut up
[49:04] no one coming in and no one going out
[49:06] see even the thought of you praying
[49:08] shakes the devil and he gets all
[49:11] conscientious and he gets all he gets
[49:13] very much anxious about you do you know
[49:16] what he does he shuts everything up
[49:17] tries to shut you up yeah you know what
[49:19] you sit in service and you'll get all
[49:22] like tied it up and the mind battles
[49:24] will come flying oh I just can't wait
[49:25] for this to be over tomorrow's gonna be
[49:27] a good day oh my and and this one said
[49:30] this to me and he said she said or
[49:31] whatever the devil will try it yeah
[49:34] he tries it on me so I know he's trying
[49:36] it on you so you can't get away from
[49:38] this but you see what is he doing he's
[49:41] anxious when you get my medals in the
[49:43] services because the devil's afraid he's
[49:46] scared of you he's scared that if you
[49:48] really break through tonight that he's
[49:49] gonna get cast out loosen away and cast
[49:52] into out of Darkness he's not even going
[49:54] to have pigs to go into he's going
[49:56] straight into out of Darkness straight
[49:58] where he cannot come back oh my help me
[50:01] Lord
[50:02] Hallelujah
[50:04] and so that's why I just say look I just
[50:06] want to encourage you no matter how you
[50:07] feel no matter what day you've had
[50:09] doesn't matter whether you've been a
[50:11] successful Christian or not today the
[50:13] blood of Jesus makes it right for you
[50:15] Hallelujah we've come into an atmosphere
[50:18] where fear has fallen off unbelief has
[50:20] fallen off doubts have fallen off
[50:22] resentment falls off
[50:23] it might come back again sometime but
[50:25] right now it's off so now why don't you
[50:28] fight the devil in that atmosphere of
[50:30] War
[50:31] that's what it's all about so the music
[50:33] Goes Forth the atmosphere changes and
[50:35] then the word goes for and now the ark's
[50:38] going forth on the shoulders of the Levi
[50:40] we're bringing the word why because if
[50:43] you put the word first all things will
[50:46] be added unto you and this the prophet
[50:48] said let the word do it yeah
[50:51] we're not just reading some
[50:54] philosophy
[50:56] that's right hallelujah amen man I need
[50:58] a drink
[51:06] okay
[51:07] I'm almost done actually like that was
[51:09] pretty much the thought so
[51:10] Hallelujah
[51:12] I'm trusting in the Lord this is not a
[51:15] typical
[51:16] Andy style
[51:19] I feel like rolling my sleeves up
[51:21] Hallelujah
[51:26] what happens when you roll your sleeves
[51:27] up
[51:29] Hallelujah I've never actually done this
[51:31] before but this shirt's quite hot
[51:34] Hallelujah now we're ready let's fight
[51:37] Hallelujah
[51:39] oh my I believe that we're ready for
[51:41] battle
[51:41] we're together we're in the war together
[51:43] right with comrades Hallelujah comrades
[51:47] together on the winning team amen it's
[51:49] totally rigged we're totally won already
[51:52] Hallelujah the devil's just he's just
[51:54] defeated all right whenever the devil's
[51:57] future is bad his past is bad and now
[51:59] it's going to be even worse
[52:01] you know that when I look back I see
[52:04] Victory after Victory after Victory I
[52:06] don't look back and see oh this person
[52:08] did this and that one did them I failed
[52:10] there and no no I see Victory after
[52:12] Victory after Victory and when I look
[52:14] forward I see Victory after Victory
[52:16] after Victory and right now we're gonna
[52:18] walk in Victory I'm not worried about
[52:20] what I feel I'm not worried about mine
[52:22] nothing tonight we pray tonight we fight
[52:26] the enemy
[52:28] and you know what it's gonna be God that
[52:30] fights the enemy in our lives through us
[52:32] because he said he would do it we're
[52:34] just following the prescription what is
[52:37] the prescription bring the worship
[52:39] change the atmosphere bring an
[52:40] atmosphere give me Glory worship God and
[52:44] then the word and then the battle and
[52:47] the battle oh my you think of the time
[52:50] when Jehoshaphat you know they were had
[52:52] all the enemy coming in on them and
[52:54] Jehoshaphat was a righteous man before
[52:55] the Lord and so he got down and he
[52:57] started praying and God says fear not
[52:59] Jehoshaphat
[53:00] don't worry I've got this
[53:03] and even though all odds were stacked
[53:05] against little tiny Judah yeah little
[53:07] tiny Judah
[53:09] all these big enemies coming in God says
[53:12] don't worry and I say tonight no matter
[53:15] how big your enemy is no matter how hard
[53:17] it seems
[53:18] no matter what it is we've got a big God
[53:21] who's able to
[53:24] hold it he made whole armies hundreds of
[53:26] thousands of people just disappear
[53:28] oh my
[53:30] God you know what the next day after you
[53:33] know they just kind of had a meeting and
[53:34] they prayed and then all of a sudden it
[53:35] changed and I believe tonight it can
[53:37] happen the same because he's the same
[53:38] and all of a sudden the atmosphere
[53:40] changed and then a prophecy went forward
[53:42] and if God bring into prophesy Freedom
[53:45] over you and prophesy Deliverance to
[53:49] prophesy your enemies to fix Hallelujah
[53:52] gone finished
[53:53] the enemy's finished he's finished no
[53:56] matter how long he's been striving at
[53:58] you and how long he's been holding you
[54:00] down let a little music come forth yeah
[54:03] let your new song

[55:43] charged him to put the ark first after
[55:45] the ark went forth what went forth then
[55:49] singing
[55:50] that she was around the other way
[55:51] players with of instruments but they

[56:23] god what is your burden
[56:25] what do you want Lord Jesus to do
[56:27] tonight
[56:28] and this is the what came so let's just
[56:30] believe that God wants to fight for you
[56:34] he wants to enter into the struggles
[56:36] that you're facing right now he wants to
[56:38] stand in and see so that you can see the
[56:40] salvation of the Lord

[57:22] walls of Jericho fell down hey man
[57:25] that's a big thing right we read it so
[57:26] much it becomes common but it's big God
[57:29] does big things

[57:57] Hallelujah

[58:00] your brain right now that's negative
[58:02] cast it away we won't we won't look at
[58:04] you and go why are you saying stuff in
[58:06] the service because we realize that
[58:07] there's an enemy a real one and he's
[58:09] trying to swat our minds and he's trying
[58:12] to take a mind over here and a mind over
[58:14] there and connect those demons
[58:16] to try and get you both thinking because
[58:18] he works through men to create trouble
[58:21] but if he can't work through people he's
[58:24] got no power
[58:25] so tonight cast every imagination down
[58:28] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[58:30] carnal But Mighty through God through
[58:32] the pulling down of strongholds
[58:34] by faith the walls of Jericho fell down
[58:36] after they were compassed about seven
[58:38] days by faith the Harlot Rahab perish
[58:40] not with them that believe not when she
[58:43] had received the spies with peace and
[58:46] what shall I more say for the time would
[58:48] fail me to tell if Gideon and of Barack
[58:50] and of Samson and objector and of David
[58:53] also and Samuel and of the prophets who
[58:56] through faith subdued kingdoms

[59:44] Calvary connected us to our Eternal
[59:47] identity it didn't just forgive us of
[59:49] sins it's not such a little thing it's a
[59:52] great thing we're being connected back
[59:54] to our Eternal Origins
[59:56] that's what the cross did
[59:58] Hallelujah you got an advantage you know
[1:00:00] the devil's advantages is nothing he
[1:00:02] ain't got no Advantage you've got an
[1:00:03] advantage because before even he was
[1:00:06] created or even before it oh you
[1:00:09] rejected everything that he did in God's
[1:00:12] mind you stood for truth in heaven
[1:00:14] before the devil was even on the Earth
[1:00:17] Hallelujah
[1:00:19] that's what the prophet says we stood we
[1:00:21] rejected the devil's a lie in the
[1:00:22] beginning
[1:00:24] it's our Eternal identity if we rejected
[1:00:27] it there we'll reject it here if we
[1:00:29] receive it then we will receive it here
[1:00:31] that's why there's an eternal identity
[1:00:33] that you're being connected back to
[1:00:34] that's why you can receive the word
[1:00:36] because you've been connected to that
[1:00:38] Eternal part

[1:06:36] all these things
[1:06:39] Shedrick Michigan a bit ago they were in
[1:06:41] the fire

[1:06:45] imagine the power of God
[1:06:49] and the furnace if you go near a fire
[1:06:52] you stink of smoke right yeah
[1:06:56] God does impossible things amen you may
[1:07:00] be in a furnace tonight
[1:07:03] but just remember that all that's going
[1:07:05] to do is take your bonds off
[1:07:08] and if your friends are in there too
[1:07:10] their bonds will loose in the furnace
[1:07:13] fire burn only the thing that was
[1:07:15] detrimental to them but they actually
[1:07:17] got stronger you know why because the
[1:07:18] fourth man came and it got in fellowship
[1:07:20] with them
[1:07:21] so don't think that God doesn't go with
[1:07:23] you in those trials he's with you right
[1:07:26] he's in there and somehow you know when
[1:07:29] us right in this world and there's

[1:07:47] right hand but it shall come not neither
[1:07:49] Only With Thine Eyes shalt thou behold
[1:07:51] and see the reward of the wicked because
[1:07:53] you have made the Lord which is my
[1:07:55] refuge even the most higher thy
[1:07:58] habitation there shall no evil befall
[1:08:01] thee neither shall any plague come
[1:08:03] neither thy dwelling and I've been
[1:08:06] saying that a lot lately
[1:08:07] because I don't like plagues and I don't
[1:08:09] like colds I don't like viruses and I
[1:08:11] hate them and they get cast out all the
[1:08:13] time amen amen I will never accept it
[1:08:16] I just wanted to encourage you never
[1:08:17] never accept the devil's colds never
[1:08:20] accept those viruses never accept
[1:08:22] sickness never accept mental illness
[1:08:24] never accept any box of snakes that he
[1:08:27] tries to throw at you never accept it
[1:08:29] there might be symptoms all over you but
[1:08:31] you still stand and not accept it
[1:08:34] don't own it never take ownership
[1:08:37] he'll try everything
[1:08:40] but he cannot take you never let your
[1:08:43] faith accept anything that he tries to
[1:08:44] give you
[1:08:47] yes one Thessalonians one five for us
[1:08:48] gospel came not unto you in word only
[1:08:50] but also in power in the Holy Ghost and
[1:08:53] in much Assurance as you know what
[1:08:56] manner of men we were among you for your
[1:08:57] sake one Corinthians 4 20 for the
[1:09:00] kingdom of God is not in word but in
[1:09:02] power
[1:09:03] this is New Testament stuff now
[1:09:04] Philippians 4 13 I can do all things
[1:09:07] through Christ which strengthen us me
[1:09:11] for though we walk now 2 Corinthians 10
[1:09:13] 3 to 5 to 6 it says for though we walk
[1:09:16] in the flesh we do not war after the
[1:09:18] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:09:21] not carnal
[1:09:22] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[1:09:24] down of strongholds casting down
[1:09:25] imaginations
[1:09:27] and every High thing
[1:09:29] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:09:31] of God and bringing into captivity every
[1:09:34] thought to The Obedience of Christ every
[1:09:37] thought amen amen oh my Lord help us
[1:09:39] amen help us Lord
[1:09:42] oh my
[1:09:44] God oh thoughts everywhere so many
[1:09:48] thoughts
[1:09:51] some are good and some are bad
[1:09:54] now the Lord give us discernment to
[1:09:56] discern every thought
[1:09:59] it sounds like a big task but you'll get
[1:10:01] on top of it because God will come into
[1:10:03] you it's the anointing God is given he
[1:10:05] doesn't say these things and then he's
[1:10:07] no provision he provides the oh yes the
[1:10:10] power he provides the anointing he
[1:10:12] provides the strength he gives you the
[1:10:15] word the vision everything to to
[1:10:17] accomplish these things in you through
[1:10:19] you he just wants to be your source of
[1:10:21] strength amen and let's make God like
[1:10:24] just consciously just say Lord You're my
[1:10:26] source of strength amen just just just
[1:10:28] make an effort
[1:10:30] because we can easily find many things
[1:10:32] to strengthen us and be a source of
[1:10:34] strength but what about God
[1:10:36] what about me I think Belinda wrote that
[1:10:39] song saith the Lord
[1:10:40] and she sung about everyone getting busy
[1:10:42] and doing all this stuff but then and
[1:10:43] leaving God
[1:10:45] the gentleman who doesn't Force his way
[1:10:48] into your life but he will take what you
[1:10:50] give him
[1:10:51] what about me saith the Lord
[1:10:53] Hallelujah
[1:10:56] and having casting out imaginations
[1:10:58] every High thing that exalts itself
[1:10:59] against the knowledge of God and
[1:11:00] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:11:02] The Obedience of Christ and having inner
[1:11:04] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[1:11:06] when your obedience is fulfilled acts 16
[1:11:09] 25 and 26 Hallelujah I just want you to
[1:11:13] really believe that tonight no matter
[1:11:15] where you're at and watch what God does
[1:11:17] in a situation which looked very
[1:11:19] hopeless and and some situations that we
[1:11:22] find ourselves in are so hopeless in the
[1:11:24] in the way that the devil would try and
[1:11:25] paint it to you but remember it's never
[1:11:28] hopeless you're never without
[1:11:30] opportunity
[1:11:32] no matter where you're at no matter how
[1:11:34] deep down no matter how far down how
[1:11:37] failed how whatever
[1:11:39] is always an opportunity
[1:11:41] always an opportunity
[1:11:43] God is a god of opportunity
[1:11:45] his promises are full of Rich
[1:11:47] opportunities and there's nothing that
[1:11:49] can stand in the way of them happening
[1:11:50] there's no situation no physics no
[1:11:53] economics no Devils no nothing
[1:11:57] stand in the way of God's promises
[1:11:59] making something materialized
[1:12:03] Paul and Silas
[1:12:05] glory and at midnight
[1:12:09] Paul and Silas prayed
[1:12:12] Hallelujah
[1:12:15] you see they're getting ready for battle
[1:12:18] they were in a prison they were in the
[1:12:20] prison of Prisons they got beat
[1:12:23] but they started singing and praying at
[1:12:24] midnight
[1:12:25] right in the middle of the night when it
[1:12:27] was real bad
[1:12:28] and they thought man we're going you
[1:12:30] know they didn't think that but the
[1:12:31] devil did the devil thought I'm going to
[1:12:33] kill these guys Herod and all whoever
[1:12:35] put them in there they were that that
[1:12:36] was trouble on their minds but actually
[1:12:38] that was the opposite way around
[1:12:40] Hallelujah tonight it's the opposite way
[1:12:42] around because tonight we're going to
[1:12:43] gather together we've done what we can
[1:12:45] in that sense we've put the music the
[1:12:48] words gone forth and now it's time for
[1:12:50] battle
[1:12:51] Hallelujah
[1:12:53] Paul and Silas prayed and sang Praises
[1:12:55] unto God and the prisoners heard them
[1:12:58] and suddenly there was a great
[1:13:00] earthquake so that the foundations of
[1:13:02] the prison were shaken and immediately
[1:13:05] if I say immediately
[1:13:08] all the doors were open
[1:13:10] not just some God doesn't just set you
[1:13:12] part way free yeah
[1:13:14] yeah Deliverance is total
[1:13:16] all the doors are open tonight
[1:13:20] all the doors are open it's time to walk
[1:13:23] through those open doors how far are you
[1:13:25] gonna walk
[1:13:27] just part of the way up you'll sit there
[1:13:29] daydreaming we're just gonna are you
[1:13:31] gonna act upon the impulse of faith
[1:13:34] because there's faith in the room
[1:13:36] tonight
[1:13:38] and the prison and the Earth
[1:13:41] foundations of the prison were shaken
[1:13:42] and immediately all the doors were
[1:13:44] opened and everyone's Bonds were loosed
[1:13:50] let's stand
[1:13:55] let's have the musicians
[1:14:00] that's any good to us
[1:14:05] you know when I was in Israel
[1:14:09] and I was at the Western Wall
[1:14:12] that's like the closest the Jews can get
[1:14:13] to the Temple Mount and pray
[1:14:16] to where the holy of holies was
[1:14:18] you know there's a real atmosphere there
[1:14:21] is an atmosphere of crying out to God
[1:14:23] for the Messiah
[1:14:25] you say because they're ancestors of
[1:14:26] ancestors of ancestors rejected the
[1:14:28] Messiah that you have freely got access
[1:14:31] to that you love that loves you that
[1:14:33] walks with you that you know
[1:14:36] and maybe need to know
[1:14:38] and just think
[1:14:41] and crying and I went up to this wall
[1:14:43] and it was big and slick from tears and
[1:14:45] sweat
[1:14:47] and in the wall and all the cracks
[1:14:48] there's millions of little notes
[1:14:53] can you play um
[1:14:55] um
[1:14:56] oh that song I wrote down your name is
[1:14:59] power
[1:15:01] is that how is that the name of it
[1:15:03] and all in the cracks of this wall was
[1:15:06] prayers and you go up and I actually
[1:15:08] prayed at that wall because I I pray
[1:15:10] that the that these people would meet
[1:15:12] the Messiah I want Jerusalem you pay for
[1:15:14] pray for the Peace of Jerusalem right
[1:15:16] who knows that scripture
[1:15:18] and so I prayed for the Peace of
[1:15:20] Jerusalem there but you could feel the
[1:15:23] the the intense desire
[1:15:25] for deliverance for that nation and for
[1:15:27] them for the Messiah to come
[1:15:29] and you think right standing amongst
[1:15:31] them was someone whom the Messiah was in
[1:15:34] and there was other believers there and
[1:15:37] I thought man how ironic it is
[1:15:39] and yet
[1:15:41] desires to pray and all around Israel
[1:15:44] who knows that Israel is a natural Bride
[1:15:47] As the natural type of our spiritually
[1:15:50] and we have the Messiah and he's living
[1:15:53] in us but they've and we fight a
[1:15:55] spiritual war on demons that control
[1:15:58] people you've got Authority now to rage
[1:16:02] a war on Devils that are hurting people
[1:16:05] right
[1:16:06] they don't know how to do that so they
[1:16:09] just fight the people they're going to
[1:16:11] fight all the Philistines and the
[1:16:12] Palestinians and they fight the the all
[1:16:14] the extreme jihadists all around them
[1:16:17] now I want to show you something
[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:20] and I've seen it in in my own um
[1:16:22] research and studies
[1:16:25] that whenever Israel goes through a war
[1:16:27] or a battle you watch what happens in
[1:16:29] The Bride
[1:16:30] spiritually there's a spiritual battle
[1:16:33] now watch as I don't know if maybe you
[1:16:35] guys don't watch Israel but I watch
[1:16:37] Israel news and
[1:16:39] the the whole Arab world is starting to
[1:16:42] gather right around them and they're
[1:16:44] closing in
[1:16:45] Iran and all of their proxies and all
[1:16:48] these enemies and all of these Islamic
[1:16:51] jihadists and and all these different
[1:16:53] groups are all closing in and they're
[1:16:55] going to try and take Israel
[1:16:58] the battle is hot and array and they're
[1:17:00] sending little things here and but one
[1:17:02] thing I want you to see is they they
[1:17:04] have rallies I don't know if you've ever
[1:17:06] seen a jihadist like Hamas or
[1:17:10] Islamic jihadist rally but they all wear
[1:17:13] these masks and they're shooting guns in
[1:17:15] the air and they're they say oh we're
[1:17:17] gonna take Israel we're gonna kill them
[1:17:19] and we're gonna do all these horrible
[1:17:21] things to them
[1:17:22] and you know what they won't do any of
[1:17:25] it it's all empty threats they can't
[1:17:29] take Israel you know that yeah yeah and
[1:17:32] they know they can't take it and that's
[1:17:34] the devil and the spirit when he tries
[1:17:37] to tell you things do you know what he
[1:17:39] what it is it's just as empty as they're
[1:17:41] rhetoric it's just as empty he just says
[1:17:44] all this waving stuff over you and tries
[1:17:46] to bring you down to try and stop you
[1:17:48] from breaking through but tonight I
[1:17:50] speak breakthrough over you I speak
[1:17:53] Faith over you I just want you to say I
[1:17:55] receive faith I'm gonna break through
[1:17:57] tonight I'm praying serious tonight I
[1:18:00] want to meet with God I will have a
[1:18:01] conference with God and I believe
[1:18:03] tonight the world's gone forth the
[1:18:06] music's gone forth now let the Battle
[1:18:08] Set an array hey man who's with me
[1:18:13] let's just sing this song I just think
[1:18:15] that rhetoric is lies it's empty and
[1:18:18] it's almost comical
[1:18:20] you listen to what they say and you
[1:18:21] think oh my goodness I can't believe
[1:18:23] they're saying it do they actually
[1:18:23] believe it I'm sure they don't even
[1:18:25] believe what they're saying because they
[1:18:26] know that they're going to be post
[1:18:28] but they said anyway and I thought man
[1:18:30] something just triggered me that's just
[1:18:32] like the devil he says all this empty
[1:18:34] stuff and it sounds so big
[1:18:36] but it's absolutely
[1:18:38] absurd it's not even it's got an
[1:18:42] overweight behind it amen
