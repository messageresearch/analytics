[27:19] amen amen god bless you all thank you
[27:23] musicians Amen it's good to be in the
[27:26] presence of the king amen if you have
[27:29] your Bibles that's and read a couple of
[27:32] places and we're gonna begin an Luke
[27:38] chapter 15 and we're gonna read from
[27:50] verse 12 verse 11 this is probably a
[27:54] familiar piece of scripture to to
[27:56] everyone this is in the younger of them
[28:00] I mean sorry verse 11 this is the story
[28:03] of the of the prodigal son and he said a
[28:07] certain man had two sons and the younger
[28:09] of them said to his father father give
[28:11] me the portion of goods that's fallen to
[28:13] me and he divided unto them his living
[28:16] and not many days after the younger son
[28:19] gathered all together he took his
[28:20] journey into a far country and there
[28:22] wasted his substance with riotous living
[28:25] and when he had spent all there arose a
[28:28] mighty famine in that land and he began
[28:30] to be in want and he went and joined
[28:33] himself to a citizen of that country and
[28:35] sent him and so and he sent him into his
[28:38] fields to feed swine and he would fain
[28:41] have filled his belly with the husks
[28:43] that the swine did eat and no man gave
[28:46] unto him and when he came to himself he
[28:49] said how many hide servants of my
[28:51] father's have bread enough and to spare
[28:53] and I perish with hunger I will arise
[28:56] and go to my father and will say unto
[28:59] him father I have sinned against heaven
[29:01] and before thee and him no word no more
[29:03] worthy to be called thy son make me as
[29:06] one of our hired servants and he arose
[29:08] and came to his father but when he was
[29:11] yet a great way off his father saw him
[29:14] and had compassion and ran and fell on
[29:17] his neck and kissed him and the son said
[29:19] unto him father I have sinned against
[29:21] heaven and in thy sight and I'm no more
[29:23] worthy to be called
[29:24] my son but the father said to his
[29:26] servants bring forth the best robe put
[29:29] it on him and put a ring on his hand and
[29:31] shoes on his feet and bring hither the
[29:34] fatted calf and kill it and let us eat
[29:35] and be merry for the son for this my son
[29:38] was dead and is alive again he was lost
[29:41] and is found and they began to be
[29:44] married I mean I like that now let's go
[29:47] to Ephesians chapter 2 and we're gonna
[29:55] we're gonna read from verse 11 we're
[30:01] gonna read just the verse 11 down to
[30:03] verse 13 it says this here wherefore
[30:07] remember that ye being in time past
[30:11] Gentiles in the flesh who are called
[30:14] uncircumcision by that which is called
[30:17] the circumcision and the flesh made by
[30:19] hands that at that time you were without
[30:23] Christ being aliens from the
[30:25] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[30:26] from the covenants of promise having no
[30:29] hope and without God in the world but
[30:32] now in Christ Jesus you were sometimes
[30:34] were far off are made nigh by the blood
[30:37] of Christ amen may the Lord bless us
[30:40] word this evening you may have your
[30:41] seats I want to speak about the joy of
[30:44] redemption I mean you know Christianity
[30:47] is a heartfelt religion and you know we
[30:51] have something to rejoice in you know
[30:52] brother brand preaches a sermon
[30:54] Redemption and completeness and in joy
[30:56] and there's something about when when
[30:59] someone goes from being lost and maybe
[31:02] just raised in a Christian home and or
[31:05] in a church or maybe out in the world
[31:07] that doesn't really matter where you
[31:08] start it's where he finishes the main
[31:10] thing and God begins to call that person
[31:13] and they didn't respond to that call and
[31:16] they go from being lost to being found
[31:20] where there's a joy where once you were
[31:23] drifting on the sea of life and then he
[31:26] comes and he gets ahold of you and he
[31:29] lifts you up a many places you in
[31:32] heavenly places on himself I mean there
[31:35] is a definite time where you must know
[31:37] some
[31:38] thing happened to you I mean where it
[31:40] said where where it's more than just
[31:42] maybe something you do but it becomes a
[31:45] joy to serve God it becomes a joy to be
[31:48] called a Christian that's it yeah it's a
[31:50] joy I mean to be redeemed hallelujah so
[31:54] you know God is here searching out for
[31:57] hearts amen and we must be very
[32:00] sensitive to when he he he moves because
[32:02] we know that we do not gather here just
[32:05] to have a religious service then go home
[32:07] and say well I've fulfilled my religious
[32:09] duty but we're here to meet God I mean
[32:12] we're here to meet him that he would
[32:13] mold us and change us and shape us and
[32:16] you know the world wants to make us feel
[32:18] indifferent and cold and formal but God
[32:20] doesn't want us indifferent cold and
[32:22] formal our God wants us full of love and
[32:24] rejoicing and praising him
[32:27] hallelujah giving him praise for
[32:29] everything he's done for us now I like
[32:32] here in Ephesians where it said that
[32:33] that at that time you were without
[32:37] Christ being aliens from the
[32:38] Commonwealth of Israel so there was a
[32:40] time now that was Ephesians 2 in verse
[32:43] 12 so there was a time when at that time
[32:46] you without him you're in the world but
[32:49] you were without him hallelujah but
[32:52] there comes a time when there's there at
[32:54] that at that time he didn't meet you and
[32:57] he becomes a living reality right now
[33:00] God is a god we should we must
[33:02] experience I mean we must really meet
[33:05] him I mean we must know what it's like
[33:07] to take up our cross and follow him I
[33:09] mean there has to come a time in life

[36:52] nice thoughts or an idea or until
[36:54] something we prescribe to it's a reality

[37:28] upon the earth I mean - Bridget chasm
[37:31] between you and God hallelujah that when

[37:59] protocol son has his own ideas we all
[38:01] had our own ideas amen he said give me
[38:05] what what what is mine go spins it but
[38:09] then the main thing as he comes to
[38:10] himself we have to come to ourselves
[38:13] right we have to come to a play
[38:15] where realize this is not how life
[38:17] should be it doesn't matter if you have
[38:19] you may be from the richest family in
[38:22] all the world you had to come to
[38:23] yourself and say this is not how life
[38:25] should be I have a better inheritance
[38:27] than this
[38:28] I'm it and he comes to himself
[38:30] hallelujah and before that a famine
[38:32] struck and I believe because the father
[38:34] was praying I mean when you see people
[38:36] go through trials they hit the ditch and
[38:38] they you know they crash to whatever
[38:40] more you say praise God God's answering
[38:42] prayer hallelujah oh yeah you're the cat
[38:46] might be on fire or whatever board
[38:47] what's going on God's answering prayer
[38:50] hallelujah because God's trying to get
[38:52] someone's attention I meant and you got
[38:54] to be you know don't be too sick headed
[38:57] when he knocks you should say yes Lord

[39:03] you'll knock a bit harder hallelujah
[39:06] I'm glad he knocks don't you I'm glad he
[39:09] knocks I mean so it comes to himself
[39:11] this is not my lot in life to be here in
[39:15] this Pigpen in a strange land I'm in and
[39:18] you have to have that kind of experience
[39:19] you know we are born and said people say
[39:22] I've never done anything wrong you were
[39:24] born lost you're born lost right your
[39:28] birth made you lost well that's not fair
[39:31] there's a way of escape I mean there's a
[39:33] blood that cleanses makes you a new
[39:35] creation hallelujah I mean that can
[39:38] change anyone it's irrelevant where
[39:40] we're from or what we've done I'm glad
[39:42] it's that way don't you
[39:44] I mean so it comes to himself and my
[39:46] father's house them you know that even
[39:48] the servants eat and you know they're
[39:50] not have want so it goes home and he
[39:54] feels I'm not worthy to be a son anymore
[39:56] and the biggest thing is you know we
[39:58] find it harder God finds it far easy to
[40:01] forgive us and we can forgive ourselves
[40:03] right he was he was still holding his
[40:06] past against him and his father was
[40:08] having prayer meetings at home one day
[40:09] he broke through a famine happened
[40:12] hallelujah
[40:13] something in them said we noticed
[40:14] Johnny's coming home hallelujah begin to
[40:17] watch watch him to come the same path he
[40:20] left he's going to walk back on their
[40:21] path hallelujah
[40:24] and then one day he sees them come over
[40:26] the horizon oh yeah I mean if I prayer
[40:29] changes things
[40:30] bread changes things when you touch
[40:32] heaven I mean that peace comes down you
[40:35] know God you're going to answer I may
[40:36] not know how but you're going to answer
[40:38] we have confidence I mean that he's
[40:40] going to do it
[40:42] Allu yeah and then his father begins
[40:44] running and braces his son oh yeah and
[40:49] then his son because he can't forgive
[40:51] himself says I've sinned against you
[40:53] against heaven sure he had but you got
[40:55] to when you're forgiven you got to
[40:57] forgive yourself - amen oh sure I've
[41:00] done a lot of bad things in life
[41:02] if God's forgiving you you can forgive
[41:04] yourself don't hold it against yourself
[41:07] right hallelujah because he says to his
[41:09] father I'm not worried that he'd be
[41:11] killed your son let me just be a servant
[41:12] that was not the father's hide at all he
[41:15] didn't want another servant he wanted
[41:16] his son back he wanted his
[41:18] flesh-and-blood back he wanted his
[41:20] family back just like God he doesn't
[41:22] want servants he wants a bride he wants
[41:24] his wife around him his children lujah
[41:28] his life changed now we have to come to
[41:34] a point we don't care we do not care
[41:40] about anyone around us because the
[41:44] biggest the biggest hindrance I know the
[41:46] biggest hindrance I had in my own life
[41:47] was my friends it was my friends that
[41:50] helped me back and I didn't even tell
[41:52] them I had any kind of faith at all but
[41:55] just I was afraid to lose them right I
[41:58] was afraid to lose them now in the grand
[42:01] scheme of things what does it matter you
[42:05] know the devil puts all these scarecrows
[42:07] up what about this person what about
[42:10] this person what about your family what
[42:12] will they say what will they do when you
[42:15] get the Holy Ghost amen
[42:17] what will your friends think of you what
[42:19] will God think of you who's the one you
[42:23] know when it's all said and done who's
[42:25] going to say well done my good and
[42:26] faithful servant it's not going to be
[42:28] your friends or your family or your
[42:30] church it'll be him it'll be our Lord
[42:33] Jesus Christ hallelujah
[42:37] the rich young ruler wasn't willing to
[42:41] lay down his riches because he was
[42:43] afraid of what people would say about
[42:45] him he wasn't willing to give up his
[42:48] riches people thought a lot of them
[42:50] here's a very religious man he says Lord
[42:53] I've kept all the commandments from my
[42:55] youth and and before then he asked Jesus
[42:58] watch I do to inherit eternal life Jesus
[43:01] you know the commandments are thy father
[43:02] and mother and etc and she says I've
[43:05] kept these from my youth the Lord you
[43:07] know the Lord knows all things
[43:08] he didn't say you're a liar he
[43:10] acknowledged you actually kept them he
[43:12] was a good message person but one thing
[43:15] thou lacus sell all that you have take
[43:18] your identity you know we craft this
[43:19] image that we try and put forward we
[43:22] have our own branding wherever our logo
[43:25] sometimes we rebrand as we get older I
[43:27] used to be this guy now Musk I you know
[43:30] have my own logo have my own image this
[43:32] is me you got to get you got to get rid
[43:34] of that thing because that was as long I
[43:36] didn't want to get rid of his logo he
[43:38] didn't want to rebrand he wanted to keep
[43:40] his lagos a rich young ruler success and
[43:43] godliness maybe that was his catchphrase
[43:46] I don't know cuz he was religious and he
[43:48] was wealthy he was successful right good
[43:51] barrels I kept the law from my youth he
[43:54] was proud proud of his religion but he
[43:57] had to rebrand it wasn't enough that did
[44:00] not give me ternal life and he knew this
[44:02] there's like the first question asked
[44:04] Jesus that's the only one he asked him
[44:06] what shall I do that I may inherit
[44:08] eternal life he knew that as religion
[44:11] did not give me to new life I think it's
[44:15] a good question that's a very good
[44:16] question to ask the Lord Jesus what
[44:19] shall I do to inherit eternal life and
[44:21] Jesus just comes down to the crux take
[44:24] your logo take your branding take your
[44:26] image sell it give to the poor that you
[44:30] probably think you're better then give
[44:32] the ball take up your cross better
[44:34] approach of us be the reproach of us and
[44:37] follow me hallelujah now we know he
[44:42] turned it down
[44:44] if there's never a pleasant thing no one
[44:47] dies actually easy
[44:49] doesn't matter how much meat someone
[44:51] might have or whatever no one really
[44:53] dies easy if you look at the state the
[44:56] body goes through and death no death is
[44:59] really an easy death or a nice death but
[45:02] after death is glorious after death is
[45:05] glorious that's why you know if you know
[45:08] if we could only really put in words how
[45:11] great it is to die how great it is to be
[45:13] born again it's not a test it's not a
[45:16] nice phrase but God births he changes
[45:19] your nature I mean when we when she had
[45:22] a big weight of sin he takes that weight
[45:24] off hallelujah burdened down you
[45:27] couldn't even live with yourself and
[45:28] then he takes it from you and burdens
[45:30] now a lighter brighter is my way it is
[45:33] such a joy to walk with him where my
[45:36] journey here is over Oh woody on the
[45:39] other Shore eternity once we begin our
[45:42] glory glory hallelujah praise the Lord
[45:45] today I know I'm free he is with me and
[45:49] if I stay close to him say from having
[45:51] danger I will be that's more than a
[45:53] story or a song more than just a nice
[45:55] lyric it's a reality how old are you who
[45:59] knows what it's like to have a sin
[46:00] burden go I mean who knows what it's
[46:03] like to lay it all down completely on

[46:13] of me doesn't matter what ridicule I may
[46:16] receive I want to take up my cross and
[46:18] follow you there are approaches worth it
[46:22] friends I mean the bad back your the
[46:24] rejection whatever more it's worth it

[46:30] totally to become a new person a new
[46:33] creation by the blood of God hallelujah
[46:36] it is a reality I preached about what

[47:22] to you and say it's not really that
[47:24] worth it well you don't really have to
[47:28] Jesus's first doctrine as you must be
[47:30] born again that was this first teaching
[47:33] he says very very well absolutely

[47:37] born again amen
[47:39] and once you are it's a glorious thing
[47:43] it's a reality we can have joy in the
[47:46] trial I mean we're the enemy just with

[48:46] salvation and the devil says well you've
[48:49] got time why don't use that same amount
[48:52] of time for the Lord why not have that
[48:54] same amount of time for God to come and
[48:56] live in your life
[48:57] and manifest themselves I know every
[49:00] believer that I've ever met they said if
[49:01] only I knew him younger and absolutely I

[49:33] there's nothing wrong to imagine those
[49:35] kind of things how wonderful would it be
[49:37] mentioned David there he is he's looking
[49:40] after his father's sheep just like many
[49:42] other days and then a servant comes
[49:46] except the prophet Samuel said our home
[49:48] he wants you okay looks long comes into
[49:52] the house he's been at their house many
[49:54] times it's very loves prophet Samuels
[49:57] their God tells that prophet this is my
[50:00] king kneels down
[50:02] daunting oils poured Spirit of God comes
[50:05] upon him from that day on and he goes
[50:08] back to the sheep but have been a lot
[50:10] different out there in that paddock yeah
[50:13] would mean a lot a lot different before
[50:15] God wasn't there now he was I mean
[50:18] before before he he was only there
[50:19] desert a world looking out of a sheep
[50:21] now the Lord is my shepherd I shall not

[50:27] to sink to his traitor to his maker to
[50:29] his Redeemer hallelujah and God comes
[50:31] down that panic oh yeah and then maybe a
[50:35] world this would be me as a man I wish
[50:37] this happened a long time ago I mean and
[50:40] that's how different it is with God in
[50:43] your life not just talking about him not
[50:46] just saying nice things that other
[50:48] people believers want to hear but you
[50:51] actually know him hallelujah amen
[50:55] and then the lion comes in he kills the
[50:58] lion and the bear comes in and he kills
[51:01] the beer and then Goliath comes in and

[51:06] victory a mini sista cloth I'm gonna cut

[51:13] his own weapon against them and what
[51:14] happens his head is severed and it's
[51:17] done hallelujah Amen now that's why
[51:20] being a work story

[51:54] protector hallelujah how was your day I

[52:03] that same God is here that same God that
[52:06] is right here amen I and how was it well
[52:10] I
[52:10] all my brothers were there they weren't
[52:12] looking too happy and I got called and
[52:15] they sent just kneel down and I felt
[52:17] this oil come on me but then I felt more
[52:20] than just all come on me the Spirit of
[52:22] God came around me and that same
[52:24] presence is with me wherever I go
[52:26] hallelujah I mean how credible that
[52:29] would be then what about now you go to
[52:31] the day of Pentecost Terry in Jerusalem
[52:34] until you are endued with a power from
[52:36] on high
[52:36] they had to lay it all down they had to
[52:39] die to themselves had to get rid of all
[52:41] the pride whatever things trying to hold
[52:43] them back
[52:43] oh the Apostle Peter I'm you know upon
[52:46] this rock I'll build my church and y'all
[52:48] he had the revelation he's the Christ
[52:49] all that proud pride was kicked out
[52:52] right he had to go through that The
[52:55] humiliation during the crucifixion to
[52:57] get rid of those things they had to pray
[52:59] through you have to lay it all down when
[53:03] you really mean business God will meet
[53:04] you when you really when you're
[53:06] pretending he knows right you can't fool
[53:09] you may fool me you can't fool him
[53:11] right and then there on the day of
[53:12] Pentecost they've been there 10 days the
[53:17] tenth day was different only the tenth
[53:20] day was very different no doubt they had
[53:22] testimony meeting you know was like to
[53:25] see him resurrected to run to the tomb
[53:28] what was like Mary ran to the tomb tomb
[53:32] was open he wasn't there
[53:35] how'd you feel broken that's the worst
[53:38] day of my life up to that point I turn
[53:41] around I hear a voice I think and I
[53:45] think it's a gardener but then he sees
[53:47] my name sweetest name sweetest voice
[53:50] ever heard in my life
[53:51] the resurrected one Lord their whole
[53:57] life changed oh it's you Lord you've
[54:00] risen go tell my disciples of risen and
[54:03] then he appears to them Thomas was there
[54:05] I won't believe until I
[54:08] I see the holes in his hands in his feet
[54:10] I don't believe he's risen that's your
[54:11] stories you guys had just way too deep
[54:14] in this kind of stuff I don't know if he
[54:16] can raise Lazarus but him himself I
[54:18] don't know and then then Jesus appears
[54:20] oh that's why touch me put your hand in
[54:27] my side touch the hulls of my hands they
[54:31] says my Lord and my god hallelujah he
[54:34] knew he's the supreme one hey man he
[54:36] says blessed are thee that do not see
[54:39] yet belief hallelujah I'm in you're
[54:42] blessed to not see that yet still
[54:45] believe it
[54:45] and then now they're in there in the
[54:47] upper room you're gonna put yourself
[54:49] there because that had to happen to you
[54:51] I trust it has then it sound like from
[54:55] heaven like a rushing mighty wind fills
[54:57] the place well this didn't happen for
[54:59] the first nine days this is a bit
[55:01] different and the pillar of fire comes
[55:02] into the room separates itself out Kalea
[55:06] and that same presence that was with the
[55:08] Messiah is now in the room it's the same
[55:10] God and just one twist it all goes into
[55:12] them all this is a different kind of day
[55:15] holy they begin to rejoice and shout and
[55:18] give praise we've been redeemed God
[55:21] lives at us I mean washed by his blood
[55:23] hallelujah and they burst out of that
[55:26] place sound like a bunch of drug people
[55:28] there's a different kind of day oh yeah
[55:32] they come to down to Cornelius house
[55:34] hello Gentiles how are you
[55:36] and then Cornelius tells the people I
[55:38] had this vision I was praying he was a
[55:41] devout man he prayed many times before
[55:43] it's good to always pray you may just
[55:46] get visited by an angel
[55:48] Amen you believe that you believe angels
[55:50] still visit people and you still walk
[55:53] into houses and you'll still speak right
[55:56] we live in Bible days the book of Acts
[55:58] is continuing he's the same God today as
[56:01] that Enoch yes he is or not in 2019
[56:05] we've got modern forget it
[56:07] God doesn't change if he did it then he
[56:10] does it today well that could never
[56:12] happen to me
[56:13] how do you know that's the devil telling
[56:15] you that oh you can't you can't walk
[56:17] that close to God that he speaks to you
[56:18] you'll never hear the voice of God
[56:20] you'll never have angels visit you you
[56:22] should actually write those thoughts
[56:25] down put a line under them and say how
[56:29] do you know how do you know right you
[56:34] should see us who have you read the end
[56:38] of your life I think do you know what's
[56:40] going to happen tomorrow oh the same as
[56:43] today how do you know how do you know he
[56:46] won't visit you 10 days there in the
[56:49] upper room the first nine are much the
[56:50] same till they got all burned out and
[56:52] right now ready for the visitation day
[56:54] 10 was very different I mean day 10 was
[56:57] very different
[56:58] here's Cornelius he's praying and angel
[57:01] meets him Cornelius
[57:03] your prayers have come up before God
[57:05] your arms and your prayers have come up
[57:07] before God he's the same right now God
[57:11] hears every prayer amen
[57:14] you're not praying to the sky you're not
[57:16] praying to a wall or to a couch or
[57:18] wherever you're kneeling or standing
[57:19] whatever you may do or driving along God
[57:22] hears your prayers and then he says now
[57:24] your your prayers and others have come
[57:26] up before God now go send him into job
[57:29] her you'll find Simon in her house
[57:31] he'll come tell you the words of life
[57:33] well this is different
[57:36] then he tells everyone brethren I've had
[57:39] a I had a visitation of an angel and
[57:42] they believed him and then he sent two
[57:45] men and then as those two men are
[57:47] travelling Peters Simon Peters on the
[57:50] rooftop and he sees a vision of a sheet
[57:51] come down with all these unclean animals
[57:53] happens three times and then the Lord
[57:56] speaks tongue there's a knock on the
[57:58] door God's ears go with those men
[58:01] he goes to Cornelius this house we live
[58:04] in these days friends I want to
[58:06] recognize we live in these days this is
[58:08] not just some nice story all that
[58:10] happened to them he's the same God right
[58:12] now right and then this Simon Peter
[58:15] comes in all the people are there you
[58:18] know what's gonna happen they are under
[58:20] expectation
[58:21] wouldn't you be under expectation the
[58:24] man that you trusted he know he's lives
[58:26] the holy life and a angel visits him and
[58:28] then he sends two men to go get the
[58:30] Simon Peter now here he is and he's
[58:33] going to tell the words of eternal life
[58:35] not just some nice lecture eternal life
[58:39] is going to be told oh my what what's
[58:42] going to happen then he begins to speak
[58:44] speaks about the crucifixion and the
[58:46] resurrection and the blood hallelujah
[58:50] and while yet Peter spake these words
[58:51] because they were gripped that were
[58:53] really do you think they would have been
[58:55] praying before Simon came Oh God
[58:58] Oh Lord this man is going to tell us the
[59:01] words of eternal life I don't know
[59:03] what's going to happen but I want to be
[59:05] ready I want to be prepared aim in order
[59:08] he prayed up hallelujah and then he
[59:11] comes and he speaks and God falls on
[59:13] them that was a different kind of day
[59:15] right and he's the same God right now
[59:20] hallelujah you know I'll just say this
[59:23] is on the Internet the first the first
[59:25] prayer meeting we ever had for this
[59:27] church we're two tongues interpretation
[59:28] there's eleven of us including children
[59:31] at that time and God said if you remain
[59:33] humble your word my word will go forth
[59:35] and people will come and find rest in
[59:38] this place to me that is God's covenant
[59:42] with us if I may be so bold he promised
[59:45] that and we're eleven and what has
[59:48] happened people have come and found rest
[59:51] hallelujah and God never said no it's
[59:54] done it still continues right now
[59:57] right so I believe I may be so bold I
[1:00:00] say I believe God is present that if you
[1:00:03] have not found rest o troubled troubled
[1:00:06] soul I know what he was like to be a
[1:00:09] troubled soul in this world burdened
[1:00:12] cumbered down by sin
[1:00:14] no peace when God meets you you get
[1:00:17] peace you get real peace and it's not
[1:00:20] peace you get by trying to explain away
[1:00:21] your situation he gives you peace
[1:00:24] everything will be fine
[1:00:26] it'll be okay I'll work this out I've
[1:00:28] got it sorted it's not that kind of it's
[1:00:31] not that kind of peace this world
[1:00:36] medicates us dolls all senses that the
[1:00:40] reality of the situation does not become
[1:00:43] apparent right it's like someone in
[1:00:46] hospital they get sedated if there are a
[1:00:48] lot of pain something's wrong with them
[1:00:49] they get medicated we need to treat
[1:00:51] these people we need to keep them in the
[1:00:54] state till they get well the devil
[1:00:56] doesn't want you well he wants you did
[1:00:58] right and this world is here to sedate
[1:01:01] us you know that the reality of our of
[1:01:04] our condition of our soul doesn't affect
[1:01:06] us amen brother Brown told the story of
[1:01:10] a was a Methodist woman her friend went
[1:01:14] to the tabernacle this Methodist woman
[1:01:16] was dying in hospital she was a Sunday
[1:01:18] school teacher who Sunday school came
[1:01:20] she was dying
[1:01:21] the Sunday School came it's actually
[1:01:24] bitter a farewell the angels were going
[1:01:26] to come and carry her heart and then
[1:01:28] when she was dying her true state of her
[1:01:32] soul became apparent to her and her
[1:01:35] preacher who was smoking a cigarette out
[1:01:37] in the corridor came in and she began to
[1:01:39] scream at him I'm lost
[1:01:41] you deceive her of men who said the
[1:01:43] story you heard the story she she says
[1:01:46] you deceive me I'm lost
[1:01:48] don't get that girl from that Tabernacle
[1:01:51] don't get that preacher you deceive her
[1:01:54] I'm lost
[1:01:55] because her real state became real
[1:01:58] because her mental faculties were
[1:02:01] leaving her right and unfortunately she
[1:02:06] died in that way but she thought she was
[1:02:10] a Sunday school teacher she was in a
[1:02:11] church she was religious she did not
[1:02:14] have risked for her soul amen

[1:02:52] felt like she was leaving her body and
[1:02:53] it was the most wonderful feeling
[1:02:56] because she was going to be if she would
[1:02:58] have died that moment she knew she
[1:02:59] wasn't going down she was going up and
[1:03:02] it was the man you asked her she had the
