thank you musicians hallelujah Amen god bless your friends it's very good to be home amen it's very good to be home can we just go to John I'd like to go to John chapter 4 then we're going to go to the book of Ephesians and chapter 1 now I've still got some frogs in my throat so just bear with me and we'll get there soon enough a man who loves the Lord tonight Alleluia now let's go to John four and then we're just going to read from verse six down to verse seven and then we're going to go to we're going to go to verse 25 and 26 so John 4 and verse 6 and and even now Jacob's Well was there it's a place Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey set us on the well and it being about the sixth hour then cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me the drink and then now and then and then they have a discourse we understand and then the woman said in verse 25 I'm just going to jump down to this and then the woman said unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things jesus saith unto her I bet speak under the Emmy amen let's just actually keep reading a few more verses down and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seeketh thou or why talk--i though with her the woman then lifted her left her waterpot and went her way into the city and says to the men come see a man which told me all things that I ever did is this not the Christ hallelujah let's go to Ephesians chapter 1 and then we're going to sorry I hope there won't do that too much now let's go let's go from verse 3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us you should say me who has blessed me with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according he has chosen say me in him before the foundation of the world that I should be holy and without blame before him and love having predestinated me until the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of his glory of His grace wherein he F made me accepted in the beloved and whom I have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace we're in here the bounded towards me and all wisdom and prudence having made known unto me the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself then that that is a dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even at him and whom also I have obtained an inheritance having predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own world that I should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom I also trusted after I heard the word of truth the gospel of my salvation and whom also after I believed I was sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of my inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession and to the praise of his glory amen god bless you friends you may have your seats you say well can you really change the scripture like that yes because you've got to make it personal I mean you can't just say us and throw it on someone else you've got to claim it I mean you've got to recognize the word is for you a minute you know don't worry about the person next to you at must the word is personally for you Alleluia so I want to talk a bit and I somehow I want to try and convey it that now it is it is an incredible thing when you think about it where God has predestinated a people to take a rapture right so God before there was a beginning before there was anything there before there was a universe before there was an angel there was just Almighty God and he had it his thoughts and his attributes and he thought of a people a meant that would one day be made into his image and not just made into his image but they would be they would take their fallen bodies would be changed a means they were just more than just had the character of Christ but then they would receive the full inheritance so the full benefit of Calvary they would receive amen and they would receive it and enjoy it and be changed by it I mean they would possess the fullness of what he paid paid for so now we just happen to find ourselves in that number right I trust I trust you can say I just happen to fall into that category of person hallelujah now we see the woman at the well her life was very much broken until Jesus came now we see that at your we didn't read it to save time but go away and read John chapter four and we we know the story very well how she had five husbands you know she went to the well at a time where the other woman did not go because she was not an accepted part of her village she was an outcast in her and her you know society she was not welcomed with the other woman so she had to go to us at a at a specific time where no one else went for water and so she found herself in this place in this condition Amen but there was something in her that what she was taught maybe at an earlier age that one day the Messiah would come and one day the Messiah would deliver his people and one day the Messiah would make an atonement he would shed his blood upon the earth he would make an atonement for his people hallelujah see she was she was taught the Messiah was going to come God himself would become flesh hallelujah that Almighty God would put on a body and it would be bought into the human race I mean that in his very veins was the purchase of the whole world I mean was the money whatever you want to call it but he had it in the bank account hallelujah and so he was going to pay it in full I mean so here he was I'll just drink this and here he was hallelujah now brother Branham if you go and you read you read about what he says about the woman at the well he would say that her parents caused her to go out onto the street and have this broken kind of life that her upbringing did it that she got sick of the fussing in the churches and she got tired of all the debates and all these different things so she kind of left that kind of a place but buried down with owner was a longing I want to see the Messiah I mean because we know the scribes and Pharisees when they saw Jesus deserting their hearts they didn't say we know when Messiah comes he'll tell us all things none of them said that but the woman at the welder hallelujah there was someone upon the earth looking Amen I trust you than you was looking hallelujah if when God would come and find you we know when Jesus comes he'll tell us all things amen he sent us Elijah to tell us all things hallelujah it's amazing because you think it wasn't brother yo this message is not brother branham's learning I mean he did not go to a Bible School to understand the mysteries of God he didn't get a theology degree like the world would want him to get amen but when he would preach sermons like crisis of mystery of God and yo you know revealed he had a concordance and his Bible and then he stands to the pulpit says I'm going to tell you what was in the back parts of God's mind before the foundation of the world hallelujah and the whole word from Genesis to Revelation has opened up a mean no man spake like this man because it wasn't man's intellect hallelujah I'm glad because it was every was man's intellect to be like the scribes and Pharisees away was such a fellow will have not this man rule over us Amen so now the woman at the well before Jesus came she thought this was her this is her pardon life I'm going to be an outcast you know the people are never going to accept me because I love to hold my past against me and she was but she was looking for love she was looking for a satisfaction but she could not find it in her first marriage or her second marriage or her third marriage or her fourth marriage or her fifth and then maybe she thought what's the point of getting married I'll just live with someone but then she found not the satisfaction there either but then finally her real husband came I mean God made flesh came to the world because he said I need to go by the way of Samaria so now she was going to find her life was very different hallelujah I know it's called that side but let's just enjoy church I mean let's just enjoy the Lord I mentioned now here she was endless endless predicament but now she was really meeting the one that could really satisfy her every need hallelujah and she found herself and a group that she would never have the world would never put her into that bracket of the bride of Jesus Christ where here was the one here was one of those that God Himself was looking for hallelujah brother Branham would tell the story of thee of an eagle debt that that lays two eggs no Eagle always normally lays 2x and the older one kills the younger one that's called Canaan ISM Cain kills Abel every time but it would tell a story where a farmer would find the two eggs and maybe I think take one you know and put it under a chicken you know a chicken and a chicken farm and then so now this is like us I mean God has so many pills Hren he knows where they are we were born into this world we did not understand who we really are you can say well I'm from this country this is my native language these are my parents this is my grandparents this is my town but that's not really who you are I mean that is really not because to know who you are because there's always that question where where every person has to come to it before there's a rapture there's a gate there's a door called death amen where people step from this world to the next world and so now there's the question begins to come where am i really from Who am I really Who am I I don't know I'm going to go through I've never been through this place before there's only one what there's only one chance to go through I mean unless you're like Lazarus and get resurrected but he wasn't believing when he died so it's fine for him amen you follow me so now there's that question out where am I where am I going I don't know where I'm going people don't know where they're going they try some religion but there's got to be a reality you got to know the person who's going to grab your hand I'll Lou you know I was thinking of um brother Bosworth's testimony and he's been few others brother Bosworth was brother Browns campaign manager one of them and he was on his deathbed brother Brown goes to them and says well you know that your the conversation gone to wind your greatest time you know of your life he's 80 odd years old he says amen because the one that I've loved all these years the suit and pretty soon is going to walk through the door and I'm going to go home to be with him hallelujah Amen so he was knowing we're hitting you where he was going I mean so that's why though we like that that Eagle a meant that we are we are you know born in a in a world but we don't fit in this world amen and that and that Eagle was hatched under the chicken tried to eat the same food as the chicken you're the hinged it and it gave it enough to survive and grow but didn't satisfy it and then maybe it would have gone from one Hut I'll try thee I'll try the popular people hutch and he walk over to the one and try and put it with the cool kids then I didn't fit in there I'll go try the sporty guys cuz that's cool there may be the Nerds I've try and join it over there but doesn't quite work hallelujah he didn't know he is an eagle and brother bran says about spiritual amnesia your amnesia is where people forget they forget their memories they forget who their parents are where they're from and he says people receive get spiritual amnesia and brother BAM says about a about a boy who was in the war and he was going to be taken to an insane institution because they couldn't cure his amnesia and he's being taken on a train and they let them off for a bit of a rest and he gets off the train and then he begins to look and he sees like a water tower and he begins to walk towards the water tower he begins to walk down this path and follow up and the guards the guards were going to grab him but one of the guys he delicious follow him see where it goes he begins to walk and he looks at this path and he looks around he sees this tree he walks over here to this house and then this house and he walks up a path to her to a house there's the old man standing there on the front porch and then he runs down and brace him son on you you'd come home hallelujah and when he when his father embraced him his eyes came open as amnesia was broken hallelujah where is from he knew who his dad was that's just a natural example I mean but God puts puts things in the Bible that seem very familiar amen this familiar places in the word where we begin to read and we can identify ourselves I mean like we can identify ourselves with the woman well maybe not because we had the same lifestyle but because when the Son of Man came he had need to come and find you because you had to be you weren't part of this number on the earth I mean but there's a heavenly host I mean there's a ransom Body of Christ I Lou you that we're meant to be part of I means he says I need to go by the way of where it was Wellington or South America or South Africa or wherever you're from I need to go by the way of their hallelujah because many times we think of you know like the woman if we could just touch the hem of His garment how the woman at the bloody shoe if I could just touch the hem of His garment I'll be made whole and he's the high priest that we touched by the feeling of our infirmities and we can touch him by our faith we can touch the high priest hallelujah but then you've got to ask the question really because Jesus when when the woman touched His garment he said and virtue strength went out of him he said who touched me but now this should really be the flip side of the question here you are in life and you're you're going down you've got your 10-year plan your five-year plan your whatever year plan maybe I'll do it tomorrow plan and you're going down that way but then something touches you amen where it becomes more than a storybook that becomes more than a church service it becomes more than a tape or a voice that you may be heard all your life but something begins to move on the inside of you hallelujah and then you got to rethink what touched me I mean what changed me I mean like the prodigal son he was down in a foreign land in a in a pig farm feeding the pigs and then he came to himself what touched him what touched him in their state none of his family was there his family didn't come find him but something touched them amen what he he could have really said what touched me what just happened he says I gotta go back to father's house so begins to make his way back to father's house and then he finds himself he says I'm not worthy there's always a question of unworthiness comes in a mint because he because memory is a Jew so there's always the earth is the law and there's different things they don't understand grace like we understand grace and the Old Testament the word grace just means our unmerited favor but then in the New Testament is magnified and it means a divine influence upon the heart amen and it's reflection in your life hallelujah the grace is magnified under the blood of Jesus Christ I mean so when grace falls upon you he's a divine influence like the boy in the Pigpen where he came to himself says I'm going to go back to father's house hallelujah but then when he as I said when he when he's going back to father's house he says I'm not worthy to be called a son I'll just be a servant and this is what we think because people then well I've gone too far I've done too many bad things in life my past is haunting me continuously amen hello and then sir now he thinks I'll just be a servant but his father has been praying maybe because if you read this the story it says and the father saw the son of far-off sierra's he had his binoculars watching because he saw his son walked that way right he knew his son was going to come back the same way so one day because remember we believe in prayer do we not we believe in prayer amen there's times when you pray and you just there's a peace comes you know something's going to happen and no doubt he would have bad with his mum and see I mean I mean I mean it's wife said honey we have two sons one son is not here this is not right Amen I was going to bed up a little bit of drama amen and we've read in the scripture us and our seed will be there it's an Old Testament promise aim it out ow ow God Jehovah who we love and serve the Almighty Adonai El Shaddai i hallelujah Jehovah he promised sign I seen a me and there's a promise in here look honey it says that thy word shall not depart out of my mouth or those seats mouth or those seat seats mouth forever amen but he's gone wayward but this is the promise remember your children are just echo what system it is to put on though what's that remember we don't ask for the type of children we had a meant God didn't send you an email saying now what characteristics do you want them to be how told you want them want sex what color eyes while color here John them to be this way no you didn't ask for how they came but they came amen and God knew they would come out of you is that right God knew they would come out of you remember Levi paid tithes in Abraham it was leaving I was still he was he was in the loins of Abraham Abraham didn't know who he was he's just doing whatever ahem did right but he came out of him eventually because this is great or grandson or whatever it was amen so our children are predestinated Amen God knew that came out of you your father's a meant so so the daddy would have said look remember Adam honey Adam was the son of God and we understand that children are part of us amen they're not Aurelia there are a separate Firstman away we are just an expression of one person Amen saying in the scriptural way he with me so he must come we have promises and the word and they bowed down and took Jehovah God at his work under the blood of bulls and goats and then what happened is a boy in a pig pen they don't know what state even doesn't matter what state people are in amen I had a something I just something struck me a few a few weeks ago lot was Abraham's nephew I've got nieces and nephews amen and don't and don't just limit the nieces and nephews you know we've got family and we stand between the living and the dead amen but I real but I just realized while Abraham got got lot he saved them he saved them twice once in battle the other time he was actually beyond his reach down in Sodom here's beyond his reach amen but here comes God it's going to sit on I'm gonna can I withhold from my friend Abraham what I'm going to do and he's standing there maybe the two angels have already gone down they've already gone down to Sodom they're on their way and here's his Abraham talking with God and Abraham stands in the gap and he and he whittles it down numbers go down down down down and then now see what because he's interceding for his for his nephew that's beyond his reach physically are you following me he's beyond his reach but yet it was Abraham standing in the gap for us for his nephew and for his family amen that caused two angels to go down there amen and drag them out Allu you I've heard the story many times but might become a reality amen so now here so they pray and then a piece came honey he's coming back how do you know I just know because it's not a hope anymore it's I know it's already done that's faith when you know it's already done hallelujah and he begins to look and they sees them come afar off the particles and comes afar off I mean what touched him to come back to father's house normally sons are stubborn they won't come back to dad when they're wrong I'll just say Amen sure isn't it Amen but what but what turns us heart amen God touch them what turned your heart wherever you were you may not even have ever really recognized it even in the beginning or even now amen many of you are from overseas let's go to New Zealand what touched you to make that decision let's move to this place it has to be substantial oh yeah what amen amen hey we moved heating haloo yeah but what caused that to happen what touched you I mean to end up in this place God hallelujah Amen it cost you to go from one place to another place Amen no the woman at the well her life changed that day amen she found herself in a number and she wasn't looking to be in that number but she was part of God's redeemed amen maybe I need to finish the protocol son story because always think about being unworthy the father said no give him the best rope put put the my ring and a father's ring and the in the Bible has his seal on it give him my authority hallelujah when he signs when when he signs an order he gets the wax and he seals it with my with that signet it's as good as me saying it amen give me give him my authority but the choice is rope on him hey hallelujah he was in a better state then that he was in the beginning I think because now he could administer mercy I mean but as older brother state there is a good boy I think it's a beaten understanding you're angry I've been working for you all this time you've never made me a feast amen but the father said your brother my son was dead but now he's alive Alleluia glory not just Amen he was dead but now he's alive amen now we find ourselves part of the predestinated or rather say we find ourselves recognizing we are predestinated now God has written his Bible in such a way that's more than stories amen it's more than history it's more than a code of ethics but God has caused it to be written in such a way that the believer will be able to read or see the heart of God right that it will be more than just information but it but it is a love letter to you amen where because because of relationship or because of family hallelujah you know you see your family I know you know there's some families or some people and families and you think they are either incredibly angry with you or they're very happy and because you can't read them you don't know where are they and where are they going with these kind of how they how they fresh things and you just don't know what's here what's she saying what's he really saying and then a member of the family will say they mean listen this and listen listen this a meant the family can translate to you what the person really means I mean some people can smile at you and really thinking you did you know but some may be smiling kids I love you you're wonderful you need someone to translate I know it's an extreme case being honor me you know how people are that way you follow you can be right so you need someone to really translate to you what that person means but then if just say if you married into that family I meant you'd begin to understand how they are because you know the heart of the person you've married right and it's the same thing with God people read this and they think oh he's you know they think oh he's all judgment what a terrible God but then other people read this he so glorious hallelujah even in the Old Testament there's so much death but as but as you know there's so much you know destruction but there's more life than a destruction I mean they're so so much hardship but God sustains through the hardship I mean there's still mercy even in the Old Testament but if you don't know the heart of God you must understand what he says you're following me and so now when we read this now because it is a love letter to you you begin to understand a few things not that you study it but when it becomes a love letter to you and that's why now they just read this quote brother Brown someone asked him about as your name about the um I just he's he's asked a question about trying to um so doesn't brother Brown someone wants to know why your name why you're not mentioned in the Bible speaking about his name and he gives an answer and he says and now you see oh it's us well I imagine this dear person Isis you see and someone that loves me or they wouldn't write at see now I could not say that my name the Bible does not call my name william branham or call your name whoever it is but we are in him anyhow and these and now you see familiar places that refer to in the bible that say certain things you see now if your watch history repeats itself in the bible now justly you give me a scripture for one i see many of you writing it down third chapter st. Matthew and when God called his son out of Egypt that it might be fulfilled I was just spoken out of Egypt I've called my son now if you've got a Scofield or any reference Bible you'll follow that reference there that margin reading it will bring you back to where he called Jacob Israel out of Egypt see but Jacob was his son that he called out of Egypt also Jesus was the son that he called out of Egypt see the Word of God is never-ending see we are identified we identify ourselves in the Bible I meant when with with many different how many remembers my message on identifying yourself with Christian characters amen Phoenix Arizona where I preached it yeah many of you has got it on the tapes you identify with Christian character see you can identify yourself anywhere you want to in that scripture if you're a Christian and if you're not a Christian you can identify yourself in the Bible see so I think maybe that would help I want to get as many of these as I can speak of a question so he says he says well you know he says that there are familiar places in the scripture that identify who we are you following and so the reason the Prophet preached certain sermons took certain Texas because he wanted you to see this is you Amen so when he preaches about different aspects of the scripture you know when he preaches about invisible union of the bride and Christ you should be able to say that's me he's talking about I meant about that about that woman that's perfect you're sinless why does snow without spot or wrinkle bone of his bone flesh your flesh life as life she is him a mint and then when you read things like an ester now these things are all done because the spiritual amnesia has to be broken amen so when you go into parts like when you're like the Book of Ruth and brother Barry speaks about the Book of Ruth about the kinsman redeemer now he identifies Jesus being the kinsman redeemer but then you have to identify yourself in the scripture or rather God Himself says you are Ruth Amen you're in the field hey Ruth yo the woman at the well found herself at that well she just happened to be there now it was all predestinated but she can say I was there at the right place at the right time with the right man hallelujah amen and here was Ruth now Ruth had no control over her life amen she wasn't looking when she was a little girl she didn't say one day I'm going to go to Israel I'm going to marry the mighty man of wealth and we're going to fit here we're going to found Bethlehem and you know she wasn't looking for that she didn't plan her life that way she thought well I'm all about us I'm going to marry one I'm going to stay here you know that would have been her her life because people didn't travel a whole bunch in those days so the here she was she found herself living in living in Moab now this may be you say this is a bit laborious no no just hold on to your seat because I want it to sink in real deep she happened to find herself there and there's a famine in Israel and it got so bad some Israelites had to leave and they had to come in to had to come into Moab and she found herself looking at what are the boys and she found herself liking one of them and she found herself marrying him amen and then she found herself with a sick husband and then she found herself as a widow and then she found her her sister-in-law also your happened to her the same way because there's two sons and they found themselves widows and then Naomi found herself a widow as well well there's a different kind of place and then she found herself hearing that there was wheat back in Israel and then something in her now you could say what motivated her what motivates you amen she can put a finger on it Nome he says one day girls I'm going home I hear this week I have nothing in this place my sons are dead my husband's dead I'm going back to Israel and he comes Ruth remember she was like you she was like me these weren't some mythical people that said very profound things all the time and everything went good you know they were exactly like us and she finds herself following her mother-in-law and she finds herself cleaving to her you're gonna be my god your people will be my people where you die I'll die hallelujah and then she finds herself in a field she finds herself in a field trying to glean behind the Reapers trying to find grain just to survive there's where she finds herself it's a place like a woman at the well hallelujah but she was in the right field I mean God Oh dangerous steps into the field of boy hallelujah the only one that could redeem her a man the only one and it was actually in the law no MOBOT can enter the Congress of Israel hallelujah hallelujah grace overshadows the law amen and then so here here she finds herself in this field and then she finds herself looking at another man hallelujah and he's a different kind of man he's not just a worker he owns the whole thing hallelujah and here you find yourself the message comes your way I'll just come right on hope the message comes your way member this the word is a field I mean the world is a field and you find yourself in this word and it becomes more than just well for the bram seeds or the Bible says but now the author Amen of the word I'm in the mighty man of wealth hallelujah he steps onto the field I mean against it talk to you stay in this world I mean stay in the field hallelujah and he drops handfuls of purpose for you oh what a glorious revelation hallelujah I mean how glorious listen I mean I've been redeemed hallelujah he doesn't know he doesn't leave you like that he doesn't leave me just rejoicing in the field I mean because when he looks down at you he's not looking for someone someone to just clean up at the end of the harvest hallelujah he's looking for a wife he's looking for someone to you know you ought to marry haloo you what did what did what a godsend Elisha he following me what he said behold I send you elijah the prophet what he send us Elisha I want to marry someone I want to unite myself with someone hallelujah I want to become one with someone that's why he sent us Elisha hallelujah Amen you ask me why I'm happy hallelujah glory to God hey people are happy they're drunk err on the street they're doing whatever more they shoot their veins full of stuff I mean this is eternal amen and the side effects are never bad hallelujah glory to God you can't get hungover brother mom says you can be drunk on the Spirit of God every day of your life until you leave this world hallelujah amen I just I just want to be that kind of person hallelujah are you going by emotion no I'm going by the Word of God amen I was telling the people up and telling her if you love someone there'll be emotion with it Amen because of you if you say we love them there's no emotion then it's not real love hallelujah that's why I get happy I think of the Lord I get happy hallelujah so here we find out we found ourselves in this field Ruth found herself in a field was a place Amen but then she didn't know I don't think even Boaz really knew either himself as a man there's got to be a lineage of kings it's a change in season hallelujah I mean there's been a time of judges I mean but the king is going to come upon the throne I mean a millennium is going to come hallelujah there's been seven church ages but we're going to go beyond seventh I mean there's going to go from a seventh church age Amen now run the bride age and there's the tribulation in his a millennium hallelujah Amen hey Jesus got to sit on the throne of David in the Millennium I say Come Lord sit on your throne yes hallelujah cuz it's going to be a redeemed people I mean they'll be around that throne so here she is she's in the field maciste in the field hallelujah and then now know him he says to her go down to the threshing floor everything and I just love what what Ruth says everything you have told me to do I'll do amen it should be the same thing with us Lord whatever you want me to do I'll do I meant to win when you're when the Lord says repent to be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ for remission of sin and you receive the Holy Ghost you say yes Lord hallelujah all that you've said it's just a joy isn't it hallelujah I'm sorry I'm happy and I'll tell you what it's just gonna get worse hallelujah I'm not trying to be silly I'm just happy amen sit here she was and then now she goes down lays at his feet huh leah was laying there in the threshing floor hallelujah we're in a threshing floor I mean God is taking cuz he just when you have a sweet you don't want the stalk and the all the stuff you want the green I mean so God has come down in this evening our hallelujah to take us because we're green Alleluia I mean that's why we have trials and hardship because he wants to remove the chaff he was remove all the humanity I mean it's not you're not meant to have and we have our personnel we have different things but God is just I'm so glad hallelujah it's like we're a part you know he says we are the clay he is the Potter and he puts our clay on his wheel he gets a mold and shape and add some water and shape us and take out the bits that don't belong glory because he has an image of his mind Amen of the vessel he wants you to be I'm so glad I'm his clay on his wheel policy you can't lose being a Christian I meant it out here so so here he is now she lays down at his feet program says you got to lay down where Jesus lied down lay down at Calvary with them I mean lay down where he died on the cross with him hallelujah and then now she comes and this is glorious I love it so much says I'm a near kinsman to thee cover me with your your skirt you're mental hallelujah cover my old life remember these are familiar familiar places I mean we said you've already been there would just rejoice with being it hallelujah and so she says your kinsmen so I'm actually part of your family hallelujah amen cover me with your mantle hallelujah so she's actually going she's going to the mighty man of wealth it's like when we go to Lord Lord forgive me cover my shame cover my first nature cover my sin hallelujah with your blood cover me over her God because I'm part of you Oh yeah oh I'm so glad Oh hallelujah I'm just being me I'm sorry and then sir and then so now he's going to act and he goes you know what do you know the rest of story he waits for the next day he goes to the city gate hallelujah well before that yo he gives her 6 meters of of wheat or barley she goes back to Naomi no me says he'll not rest he will not rest parlor till this is finished a man that he descended as a mighty angel in the same time at time shall be no more it means they shall be no more delay he will not rest until he has his children up hallelujah sit around a table hallelujah amen that's why God's working that's why there's a quick short work I mean that's why God out of nothing races of people holy we're dead in trespasses and sins then God comes hallelujah that's happening it's happened hallelujah we're living in the day of the quick short work I mean say ghost goes to near kinsman who is willing to buy the field there's no Me's by the possession that cannot raise up a kingship cannot marry roof to raise up a lineage of kings hallelujah so now here comes he says I'll not do it so Boaz plays it on full makes a public testimony hallelujah Amen you can take that either way Calvary or sunset mountain public testimony hallelujah Amen that's just me anyway and then they get married Ruth is not anymore an alien a man she's not an alien out of the Commonwealth of Israel as Paul would say she's married hallelujah not just a Joe Israelite either amen but to the mighty man of wealth Polly the one who's over the Reapers Polly he's over the chief Reaper himself I mean he's the boss hallelujah then they get United and then her identity her all that entity has done away hallelujah that's why I think about what you were I mean in one way you should think about what you were to glorify God but don't let your past beat you down hallelujah don't don't let it weigh you down because she was not a MOBOT us anymore she was mrs. Bowie or Bethlehem hallelujah amen I think now she has the Sun she has o beard hallelujah lovely amen any mate they passed the baby over to Naomi hallelujah the life is given look here's the Sun that's been birthed hallelujah and the gospel is going to go back to the juice hallelujah that's a familiar place amen I trust that story it's only four chapters in the Bible but is the most to me it's one of the most blessed parts of the scripture amen but you've got to be able to see yourself with it hallelujah now we just go one more real quick as time has gone away but the same thing happens you look at Easter hallelujah what now what moved her what touched her because when Easter there isn't you know is there a Babylon the Jews have already gone back to rebuild the temple so what moved on her Allu you what moved on Mordecai her cousin that was raising her up to stay out of the promised land yeah we can't we can't understand what God does all the time because that doesn't make sense if they're really Jews they would have been back in the promised land oh no sir cuz she had to go to a throne right and she found herself in a very different kind of place she found herself in the royal family hallelujah she found herself married to the most powerful King at that time on the earth hallelujah now I trust that ass of a familiar place hello as it a familiar place you when you read the book of Esther as not just a nice story but God says your Easter hallelujah you were here world events are going on you don't know really what's going on in the world but you'll be placed on a throne hallelujah upon this earth I mean a dominion over Satan and all of his devices hallelujah amen as I said now as I've said I think I think I said it years ago remember Haman is hung his his sons are hung there's a you know all those things those his Haman was just hung and in a signet ring that was Haman was the Kings given to Haman is now given to Mordecai hallelujah and then Mordecai needs to sit down because they can write a law they can write a law because they cannot cancel out what Mordecai I mean what Haman wrote to kill all the Jews but they have the ability to write a law that can go over and beyond hallelujah amen and it all comes into being because before this ever happened the king could not sleep and the book of records was open the Kingdom Records was open the book became loose hallelujah the records were unsealed and then now a scribe we had to read before the king everything was done you know that was done this hour stirs up the King hallelujah and with the opening of the book the opening of the word hallelujah it changes you Amen you're once you're once in a place I think the word place is by the wrong word but you got to understand this was this was urine heritance mean because Esther was under the sentence of death before the record was open before the book was loosed hallelujah and then now the the seals come open hallelujah prophets placed upon the year an inheritance is distributed out hallelujah the last will and testament hallelujah is read Amen in any and he begins to say and I think the first seal it is our church I'm not going to call you church anymore I'll call you bride hallelujah because he's now designating that you're a part of an ela Clady hallelujah and then now an inheritance is distributed but it's not just but then the Holy Spirit Himself is still brooding over his word to enforce what was spoken becomes reality amen top seated before you take it a natural sense Andy you get that house at 1 3 8 we're ever that's your house now then the Lord gives them the papers he goes and gets the house if there's any squatters in the house he can kick them out and take position of his inheritance that's a natural thing a mint there's a law behind what the lawyer has said right and that's just natural but now there's a supernatural will and testament I mean we're a prophet stood he spoke it out upon the earth and the Holy Ghost is guarding his work because there's an electic amen that must receive the fullness of redemption hallelujah so she doesn't just hear that say that's a wonderful thing the Holy Ghost comes in behind I'm going to make you in here at this place I'm going to make you stand holy I'm going to cause you to put Satan under your feet I mean I'm going to make you more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ hallelujah I'm gonna mold you into his image hallelujah now we find ourselves in a different place hey amen time has escaped us but now we find ourselves in a different place and I'm just gonna leave you with this here was I'll say this here is Caleb and Joshua they are born at the right place well humanly they'd say the wrong place cause our slaves but they're bored at the right place the right time at the right season because God and his mind said to Kayla go with Caleb II said you're not meant to be putting bricks into a monument in Egypt you mean to be living on a resurrection Mountain in the pharmacy yeah I mean cuz that was the place that God had for him right so now here he is and he sees Moses come after 40 years hey you're man comes with a stick in his hand his wife and young uns on a mule going down through border control there in Egypt he says I've come to two reason for visit business you know whatever other invasion gives it to the border guard off he goes in why he says I've come to take over and he did it he took over the place hallelujah because the one who takes over dictates what they want to do what do you want to do let my people go what happened they will let go amen so here he comes now and then now his just say now we're Caleb and Joshua he comes Moses let my people go and then the plagues begin to fall and now we're in Goshen hallelujah the blood is on the door and lintel amen we're eating the Passover lamb death angel comes and strikes the strikes the place there's never been a cry like that cry but there's never been a rejoicing like this rejoicing oh yeah in Pharisees now you must go but up yo because otherwise we'll probably all die then we're marching out how they going to another place here we are prophets coming the same time I'll bring it to because we're in the third Exodus amen a blood word is spoken amen the power of Calvary has been released fullness of the Holy Ghost is a pot in the year plagues have already begun to fall the pre tribulation judgments already begin to fall now they found themselves there in Egypt 40 odd years later he was on his Mountain he found himself in a different place but because he was under the blood and lamb there and he believed what the act what God spoke through Moses he received his inheritance now here we are we've come out of the world a member we're not moving to another part of the earth we're going up amen we're going up Amen so I found a self come to this place it's because very soon we're going to go to another place hallelujah he following me so now if we've come under the atonement here hallelujah more than just Saint Jesus died for me but his life comes into you they show that he died for you in that life is going to take you from this world into the next world Halle lead you understand you're going to find yourself I'm being taken to another place hallelujah I wish I could put that how I felt it you know what I mean Oh we'll find all around the winning supper table how do we get here so the life came into me I mean I died to myself and God came and bought for me again maybe in your creature I'll look here sir musicians to come we're being taken to another place hallelujah friends this is not a myth this is not a bunch of me just getting excited and being happy about something this is eternal things amen jesus promised us a home he says I will come again and receive you to myself never I am but where you are where I am you'll be also so what's he saying he's saying that I'm up in heaven my spirits going to come is going to receive you to myself so I'm going to receive you because you lay your life down you accept what you did with me on the cross I mean what I did for you up the cross and then now so where I am I'm gonna take you D hallelujah and we'll be shouting night and day well shut night and day now amen let's sing that song again I'm so glad Jesus lifted me hallelujah amen familiar places in the Bible you should go read a few I guarantee you'll find yourself somewhere Amen it's always on the victorious I holler even in the deepest trial Holly a King David was victorious on the run from Saul or on the
