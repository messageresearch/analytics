[24:34] and Chris here and brother Phil sister
[24:36] blender got thank you
[24:37] welcome god bless you praise the Lord I
[24:40] mean let's just go to the scripture
[24:42] shall we I mean here we want the peace
[24:45] of God to cover us
[24:47] hey means let's go to the book of
[24:50] Deuteronomy and then we're going to go
[24:53] to Hebrews 11 that's what I am a short
[24:57] thought before we before we go to prayer
[25:00] that's not so just one scripture
[25:05] Deuteronomy 33 and verse 25 I mean who
[25:16] is happy to be a Christian no your
[25:19] brother Brad said you just can't lose
[25:21] being a Christian so we're here to win
[25:23] all right man he says they choose shall
[25:27] be iron and brass and as I and as thy
[25:31] days so shall thy strength be a means as
[25:35] thy days are so shall thy strength me
[25:37] and this go to Hebrews 11 and we're
[25:40] gonna read from verse 1 just a very
[25:42] familiar scripture but just want to just
[25:45] just take a small thought here I mean
[25:48] who's looking forward to camp praise the
[25:51] Lord we're gonna have a tremendous time
[25:52] I mean I think they cooked about one
[25:56] metric ton of carry today I mean so
[26:00] praise a look we're gonna we're gonna
[26:02] feast naturally and spiritually I
[26:04] believe I've been Hebrews 11 and verse 1
[26:07] now the faith now faith is the substance
[26:09] of things hoped for the evidence of
[26:11] things not seen but by it the elders
[26:13] obtained a good report through faith we
[26:15] understand that the worlds were framed
[26:17] by the Word of God so that things which
[26:19] are seen were not made of things which
[26:22] to appear by faith Abel offered unto God
[26:25] a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[26:28] which he obtained a witness that he was
[26:29] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[26:32] and by it he being dead yet speaketh by
[26:35] faith Enoch was translated so his
[26:37] viii translated him that he should not
[26:39] see death and was not found because God
[26:42] had translated him before before his his
[26:44] translation he had this testimony that
[26:46] he pleased God but without faith it's
[26:49] impossible to please God so I say with
[26:52] faith it's impossible not to please go
[26:55] on you thank you vice versa for he that
[26:57] cometh to God must must believe that he
[27:00] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[27:02] that diligently seek Him we believe he
[27:04] is don't we and we believe he's a reward
[27:06] of them that diligently seek Him by
[27:08] faith Noah being warned of God of things
[27:10] not seen as yet moved with fear prepared
[27:12] an ark to the saving of his house by the
[27:16] by the which he condemned the world and
[27:19] became heir of the of the righteousness
[27:21] which is of which is by faith by faith
[27:23] Abraham when he was called to go out
[27:25] into a place which he caught which he
[27:28] should after receive for an inheritance
[27:30] obeyed and when and he went out not
[27:33] knowing whether he went by faith he
[27:35] sojourned in his land of in the land of
[27:38] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[27:40] and the Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob
[27:43] the heirs with him of the same promise
[27:44] for he looked for a city which has
[27:46] foundations whose builder and maker of
[27:49] as God through faith also Sara herself
[27:52] received strength to conceive seed and
[27:54] was delivered of a child when she was
[27:56] past age because she judged him faithful
[27:59] who had promised their force praying
[28:03] there even of one and him as good as
[28:06] dead so many as the stars of the sky and
[28:09] multitude and as the sand which is by
[28:11] the seashore innumerable these all died
[28:14] in faith not receiving
[28:16] I mean having not having received the
[28:19] promises but having seen them afar off
[28:22] and were persuaded of them and embraced
[28:24] them and confessed that they were
[28:26] strangers and pilgrims on the earth I
[28:29] mean this bow heads let's pray
[28:32] gracious Lord Jesus truly we desire that
[28:35] your peace would cover us we're so glad
[28:37] we can stand and proclaim that our
[28:39] chains of God we've been set free Lord
[28:42] you have redeemed us you have purchased
[28:44] us Lord and just want to pray father as
[28:46] we look into your word tonight I pray
[28:48] you're just writer raise our faith Lord
[28:50] God may use
[28:51] drink for now I'll walk with you dear
[28:54] Lord a move us into a channel for prayer
[28:56] Lord may you grant to feel glory anoint
[28:58] speaker and hearer loved one more time
[29:01] father may you just move on every heart
[29:03] Lord take control of the service for
[29:05] your glory we ask in Jesus Christ's name
[29:07] Amen amen god bless you friends you may
[29:10] have your seats tonight so I want to I
[29:13] want to just take a little thought where
[29:15] we read you know how how in in in verse
[29:19] 13 how Abraham and you know all the
[29:23] believers down through the ages they had
[29:25] incredible promises but we see that they
[29:28] you know Abraham as it said that they
[29:30] all these died in the faith not not
[29:33] having received the promises but having
[29:35] seen them afar off and were persuaded of
[29:37] them and embraced them and confessed
[29:39] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[29:42] the earth so they were promised they
[29:44] were promised many things like Abraham
[29:46] he was promised at the land that he was
[29:48] called to go into would be his but we
[29:51] know the promise didn't fall to him but
[29:53] it fell to his descendants you know it
[29:55] was the children of Abraham four hundred
[29:58] years later they would be brought by a
[30:00] by a ministry of a prophet God himself
[30:03] would lead them his angel would lead
[30:04] them and they would receive the promise
[30:07] that that was given to Abraham and
[30:09] that's why when when God would come down
[30:12] into the burning bush and he would speak
[30:13] to Moses he'd say I am the God of
[30:15] Abraham Isaac and Jacob so he was
[30:17] declaring to Moses I am the one that
[30:20] gave the promised Abraham but now I now
[30:22] is the season where that promise is
[30:24] going to be fulfilled hallelujah so now
[30:27] we are living and and you just think
[30:29] about that where Abraham didn't receive
[30:31] the promise but it's so gripped his life
[30:34] and he embraced it though singing afar
[30:36] off
[30:36] it changed his whole life his whole walk
[30:39] was according to that promise
[30:41] but yet he didn't receive it and I'm so
[30:43] glad that we are not living in a season
[30:45] where we are looking for something to
[30:47] happen way off in the future and maybe
[30:49] well one day someone will rise up the
[30:51] bride will take her position one day and
[30:53] you know maybe someone will take a
[30:55] rapture some day we're not looking for
[30:57] it in the future but now we're living to
[30:58] receive the promise hallelujah is every
[31:01] promise of the scripture I mean we are
[31:03] actually
[31:04] in the day where we don't just look at
[31:06] it we receive it hallelujah that's where
[31:09] I want to go I want to go this night
[31:11] because you know brother Brown would say
[31:14] he would say and I can find it here he
[31:19] speaks of how the angel of the Lord
[31:21] accompanies the message always he sees
[31:24] it and he sees it in 1954 he sees the
[31:29] angel sorry so time and decision he says
[31:32] he says the angel of the Lord
[31:34] accompanies the message always so where
[31:36] wherever the word as God accompanies
[31:38] that word to ensure it comes to pass now
[31:41] God was with Abraham we know that God
[31:43] was with Isaac and Jacob and God was
[31:45] with Moses and so the one that gave the
[31:48] promise to Abraham was now the one that
[31:50] would lead his children into the promise
[31:52] it was the very same God it wasn't a
[31:54] different God it wasn't a lesser God the
[31:57] same one in the beginning was the same
[31:59] one at the end now if the angel the Lord
[32:01] accompanies the message always then we
[32:04] should have such confidence where his
[32:06] word as he is present Amen it's more
[32:08] than just a man speaking you know on
[32:10] table more than ink on paper but God is
[32:13] there to follow his word that when
[32:15] someone receives that word Amen he
[32:17] anoints that word and makes them live in
[32:18] their lives how then he quickens you to
[32:21] his word they meant you know I was just
[32:23] thinking of you know we know words have
[32:26] great power words have great power they
[32:29] have incredible power I mean even even I
[32:32] speaking to our children they've got
[32:33] incredible power I'm in the you know the
[32:35] words we speak about each other or to
[32:38] one another they have incredible power
[32:40] and we should never ever diminish the
[32:42] power of words even even men with fallen
[32:46] fallen fallen men under the anointing of
[32:49] demon power can change the world
[32:52] you take a Dolf Hitler amen he stood
[32:55] there and he preached under inspiration
[32:57] and it changed the world by a fallen man
[33:00] being anointed by a demon power maybe
[33:02] but how much more a redeemed son or
[33:04] daughter of God under the Spirit of God
[33:06] speaking the Word of God hallelujah you
[33:10] know I was thinking of I was you know I
[33:13] was thinking of of the Apostle Paul
[33:16] let's go back
[33:18] Apostle Paul stay he was in jail quite a
[33:21] lot amen
[33:23] he would have a meeting and most the
[33:25] time he would end up in jail
[33:26] hallelujah but Sir imagine if we regards
[33:30] guarding the Apostle Paul we would see
[33:32] no doubt a man and you know he would
[33:34] maybe we wouldn't necessarily understand
[33:37] what he was saying when he was maybe
[33:38] praying in Hebrew and or praying in
[33:40] Greek whatever language he spoke to the
[33:41] Lord and but we would see a man that
[33:43] maybe wasn't too big he wasn't such a
[33:45] big strong man but he would get down on
[33:47] his knees and talk to God and and maybe
[33:50] we would we would see him and people
[33:52] would come into the cell or come by the
[33:54] under how visiting hours were in those
[33:56] days but you know the Apostle Paul would
[33:58] would either pick up his own pen and he
[34:00] would begin to write words down on
[34:02] scrolls or he would dictate those
[34:04] letters to ascribe and and and and they
[34:06] would be written down and then and then
[34:08] people would come along just imagine
[34:10] you're on guard duty and then and then
[34:13] someone visits the Apostle Paul's here
[34:15] and he and he feels inspired to give the
[34:18] scroll to someone that's good and then
[34:20] he goes off and he takes that if you're
[34:24] on guard you to eat by thinking well
[34:26] there's not too much about what's just
[34:27] being delivered I mean but that word
[34:29] changed the world
[34:30] I mean that word that word wasn't the
[34:33] Apostle Paul I might need that later
[34:35] yeah that work wasn't the Apostle Paul
[34:38] sinking it wasn't some man's religion I
[34:41] mean that was God coming in on into
[34:43] print form hallelujah and that word
[34:45] shook the world in his day
[34:47] I mean a little man sitting in a dungeon
[34:48] Holly just writing down what God would
[34:51] inspire to him I mean then it was
[34:53] written down and it was carried away
[34:54] maybe the guys didn't think too much of
[34:56] it but that was like nuclear bombs being
[34:58] released
[34:59] honey the devil's kingdom was being
[35:01] explode up here as the hill as the bombs
[35:04] take this hallelujah I mean a dinner was
[35:06] sit down and maybe the believers would
[35:08] unroll it and and then and in it that
[35:10] begin to read and the Angel Lord always
[35:12] accompanies the message always and God
[35:15] follows His Word and there were people
[35:17] there that were listening to those words
[35:18] to some it didn't mean anything but to
[35:21] saw others have been a lot
[35:22] hallelujah the summit didn't mean to my
[35:24] choice just a Jew is just a fanatic I
[35:27] mean but those who are predestinated to
[35:28] hear the word it was he
[35:30] alive polio was the Word of God being
[35:32] released to them and God followed that
[35:34] word and when they received it God
[35:36] quickened into their souls transform
[35:38] their lives hallelujah amen
[35:42] think about it he ever thought about
[35:44] that hallelujah and God shook the world
[35:47] through one man hallelujah and you just
[35:52] think about this day you know brother
[35:55] Brown the first recorded words well they
[35:57] got these recording gadgets
[35:59] hallelujah a word is being recorded
[36:02] because it's going to be released maybe
[36:05] not just in that generation of the
[36:06] people that hear it it's going to be put
[36:07] on tape because God you the other bride
[36:09] is can be fashioned by that word gonna
[36:11] be molded by that word hallelujah and
[36:14] then you heard it and the angel Lord
[36:16] accompanies the message because he's
[36:18] waiting for you to hear that word holy
[36:20] when you heard that word something moved
[36:22] on you may be like no other words dead I
[36:24] know it happened for me and God did it
[36:26] for a reason hallelujah
[36:28] he wasn't just waiting to make you some
[36:29] religious person have a different kind
[36:31] of idea no gods won't find his bride
[36:33] hallelujah and he quickens his bride to
[36:36] his word hallelujah he says he says in
[36:42] the message trying to God a service
[36:43] without it being the will will of God he
[36:46] says the word the evening message
[36:50] must-carry evening results the evening
[36:52] message must so evening seed it's not
[36:54] morning seed evening seed is that right
[36:56] the midday scene it's at seeds back
[36:59] there was denomination of diet parish
[37:01] but the evening time message will show
[37:03] evening time light will show evening
[37:05] time results the evening time missus
[37:07] Jesus time midday message showed midday
[37:10] results the beginning message showed the
[37:13] beginning results make creation he made
[37:15] his son in his own image in the midday
[37:17] in the evening time he makes a bride for
[37:20] it see what by his word how did he form
[37:24] the earth how did he speak it into
[37:26] existence by his word who was his son
[37:29] the word in the beginning was the word
[37:30] and the Word was with God and the Word
[37:33] was made flesh and dwelt among us how
[37:35] will he take his bride by the word not
[37:37] buy a new cart not by some theologians
[37:40] idea but according to his word he'll
[37:42] identify her
[37:43] hallelujah don't put one thing - it'll
[37:46] take one thing proper now leave it the
[37:47] way to see hallelujah now when I say the
[37:51] word will identify the bride that's just
[37:52] not ink on paper that's him I didn't
[37:55] define himself with you
[37:56] hallelujah now as we speak about
[37:58] promises we know you know you would you
[38:02] would sure agree with me what's the
[38:04] point of me saying that you know
[38:05] speaking of the promise of Abraham's day
[38:08] even though it would be you know it's a
[38:11] promise in the scripture it's not you
[38:13] know the promise of we're gonna go to
[38:15] the promised land
[38:16] it's a promise in the scripture but it's
[38:18] not for today no it's a promise in the
[38:20] scripture what's the good of me saying
[38:22] you know that that is going to be a king
[38:24] come to the throne promise in the
[38:26] scripture but not for today what's good
[38:28] to me saying that John the Baptist is
[38:29] going to come it's a promise
[38:31] but it's not today's promise right
[38:34] what's it going to be saying Messiah is
[38:35] going to come and purchase the salvation
[38:37] of the world and so I'm laboring the
[38:39] store because I just want you to think
[38:40] about it we're gonna wear to preach
[38:42] today's promises you had a look at
[38:44] today's promises Abraham and breaks the
[38:46] promise for his then that would embrace
[38:48] me is like and folding your arms wholly
[38:50] he took it to himself and see this is my
[38:52] promise this is what's for me hallelujah
[38:55] but what about what's for you I mean
[38:57] ever you look into the scripture to see
[38:58] what is your promise and it what's the
[39:00] promise for this day hallelujah say
[39:03] what's the good of speaking of a promise
[39:04] of the books gonna come up and win
[39:06] another he has holy the words already
[39:09] come up and God's covenant has been
[39:11] unveiled and this day to you hallelujah
[39:14] so now now we can stand here and say the
[39:17] promise we understand in the scripture
[39:19] is the translation of the loving bride
[39:21] hallelu to meet the meet the groom in
[39:24] the air amen and I'm so thankful that
[39:27] we're not standing there in the Apostle
[39:28] Paul's day when he would pin to the
[39:30] Thessalonians we which are alive and
[39:32] remain you know hinder them which are
[39:35] asleep for the dead in Christ rise first
[39:36] and then we which are alive and remain
[39:38] shall be caught up to meet them with the
[39:40] Lord to meet them in the air
[39:42] hallelujah and and no doubt when the
[39:45] Thessalonians read weed they said that's
[39:47] us hallelujah but he is prophesying not
[39:50] of that day just like Abraham Abraham's
[39:52] day he received the promise he didn't
[39:54] possess the promise so the first church
[39:56] age they were
[39:57] see the promise but they didn't possess
[39:58] it they died in Christ waiting for the
[40:00] bride to come in the last day hallelujah
[40:03] so now that's why I said we're not
[40:04] looking for a future we have to promise
[40:07] now everything God is going to do as in
[40:10] this generation you say well how can you
[40:12] put that in Scripture what Jesus said
[40:15] speaking of Israel when you see the fig
[40:17] tree put forth its buds you know that
[40:19] summer is nigh even at the doors and
[40:20] that generation shall not pass till all
[40:23] things before little hallelujah and
[40:25] Israel has been a nation simony Yod
[40:27] years however long that generations
[40:29] going off the scene they're holed up in
[40:31] years hallelujah so that means we are
[40:33] now living in the time holding the
[40:35] promises father fulfillment is far
[40:37] closer than when we first believed
[40:39] hallelujah so now if we're living now in
[40:42] the time when the promise is to be
[40:44] fulfilled
[40:45] what we have to think now so they soar
[40:47] the rapture is as a true Jubilee it's
[40:51] where people do not taste death but they
[40:54] walk from this dimension to the next
[40:56] dimension hallelujah that's a breaking
[40:58] of death
[40:59] I mean death literally loses its grip
[41:01] it's put under her feet and she goes
[41:04] from this world to the next world by the
[41:05] revelation that you've already been
[41:07] given I mean so now if that's the case
[41:09] then that bennett's then it's speaking
[41:11] of a true Jubilee I mean where people
[41:14] are no longer living under the bondage
[41:15] of sin no longer living under the
[41:18] oppression of this or the devil but
[41:20] every cycle that can be broken will be
[41:23] broken I mean every cycle of bondage
[41:25] will be broken sin cycle will be broken
[41:27] this revival will be broken every cycle
[41:31] must be broken in this age Holly that
[41:34] we're living in hallelujah
[41:36] we're not looking for another time we
[41:38] look we are now living in the time I
[41:40] mean when brother Branham prophesied of
[41:41] the of the bride's revival this bride
[41:44] age we're living in it
[41:45] hallelujah so now we are living in a
[41:48] season where everyone that is belongs to
[41:50] God must go free I mean there's a law in
[41:53] the Word of God that actually declares
[41:55] you cannot stay in bondage you cannot
[41:57] say subject to the devil any but you
[42:00] must walk free
[42:01] hallelujah under this word because it's
[42:04] cause it's a law of God just like
[42:06] gravity Zalora God that's the same
[42:08] I think it always works hallelujah so
[42:11] now we are living in a time where every
[42:16] cycle must be broken
[42:18] yes Amen even even the Jubilee cycle was
[42:21] a cycle but now there comes a time where
[42:24] we don't go we can't be sold back into
[42:26] slavery again hallelujah I mean we can't
[42:29] go back down and just and just tried too
[42:31] long and sin or trudged along and
[42:33] religion but now we're living at a time
[42:35] where all those cycles are broken the
[42:37] cycle of revival and death is broken
[42:39] within the church hallelujah
[42:42] we're living in that day amen and and so
[42:44] we what we must do as I read it you're
[42:47] in the beginning as like days are so
[42:49] shall thy strength be hallelujah so our
[42:53] strength cometh from the Lord I mean he
[42:55] is the strength of our life you read in
[42:56] Psalms 27 so this they may be wicked it
[42:59] may be your may be dark it may be
[43:01] terrible but as our days are so shall
[43:04] our strength be and we know when God
[43:06] does anything he doesn't equal the
[43:08] strength of the devil he's always
[43:10] greater than the strength of the devil I
[43:12] mean he was he said greater than a
[43:14] Sindhi that is in the world hallelujah
[43:16] and greater does not mean equal that
[43:18] means greater I mean so that means this
[43:20] power of God within you is greater than
[43:22] anything the devil can do how low you go
[43:25] start to look at what you hide man what
[43:26] you have how they don't look at what you
[43:28] don't have look at what you have holy
[43:30] Abraham had one promise and he walked
[43:32] with that one promise Holly he received
[43:35] the promise zone he received the body
[43:36] changed to receive that promise of lujah
[43:40] we've got more than just one promise
[43:42] hallelujah we've got many promises we
[43:46] should embrace them to ourselves and we
[43:49] should walk with God amen hallelujah
[43:54] so our strength and and I'll just finish
[43:57] with that as our days are so shall our
[43:59] strength be so never think this world is
[44:02] too dark I mean remember brother BAM
[44:05] told the story and and I remember going
[44:07] I think actually it was the only time
[44:10] I've been in South Africa we went into
[44:11] the fort down cake town that star fort
[44:13] and went down into the armory or sewing
[44:16] and they turned off a light and it was
[44:18] pitch pitch pitch black you couldn't see
[44:21] any
[44:22] you felt it and broadband tells a story
[44:24] about those people going down to a place
[44:26] like that and then and in the talk light
[44:28] turns off a lot and then the little girl
[44:30] starts screaming and so dark and so dark
[44:33] but she had a brother there said don't
[44:36] cry little sis there's a man standing
[44:38] prison that can turn on the light so
[44:41] doesn't matter how dark it was how how
[44:42] dark it feels there's a man standing
[44:45] present that can turn on the light and
[44:47] he say well I'm in a dark place there's
[44:49] a man standing prison now hallelujah the
[44:52] Lord Jesus Christ himself member the
[44:54] angel of the Lord accompanies the
[44:56] message always holler is severe a
[44:58] message believer the angel Lord
[45:00] accompanies you hallelujah and he is
[45:03] standing prison to turn on the light I
[45:05] mean profound said don't worry about how
[45:07] dark it gets is a man standing prisoner
[45:09] rapturous Church hallelujah don't fear
[45:15] there's a man standing prison holy I'm
[45:19] not talking about it just in these four
[45:21] walls wherever you go wherever you go
[45:23] wherever Abraham went Godwin hallelujah

[45:28] Brad was God was where the Apostle Paul
[45:30] was God was the scripture says I'll
[45:33] never leave thee nor forsake thee that
[45:35] means wherever I go he goes
[45:37] hallelujah I trust we're conscious of
[45:40] his presence and our ups and our downs
[45:43] he's there oh it's not when you feel
[45:46] like your reps are ready it's when you
[45:48] don't feel rapture ready

[48:12] prudence having made known unto me the
[48:15] mystery of his will according to his
[48:16] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[48:18] himself that in the dispensation of the
[48:20] fullness of times he might gather
[48:22] together anyone in Christ both which are
[48:25] in heaven and on earth even in him in
[48:28] whom also I have obtained an inheritance
[48:30] being predestinated according to the
[48:32] purpose of him who worketh all things
[48:34] after the counsel of his own will that I
[48:36] should be to the praise of his glory who
[48:38] first trusted in Christ and whom I also
[48:41] trusted after I had heard the word of
[48:43] truth the gospel of my salvation and
[48:46] whom also after I believe I was
[48:48] filled with the holy spirit of promise
[48:50] which is the earnest of my inheritance
