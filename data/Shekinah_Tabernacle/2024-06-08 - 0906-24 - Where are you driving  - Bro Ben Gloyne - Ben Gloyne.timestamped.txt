[4:22] praise the Lord hello welcome to church
[4:25] this
[4:26] morning amen it's good to be here I
[4:28] always like coming to church
[4:30] Sunday or Wednesday I I always enjoy
[4:33] being in the presence of God and being
[4:34] refreshed in the Holy Ghost amen the
[4:37] first song we're going to sing is a song
[4:39] called lead me to the Rock I remember
[4:42] staying at uh we were at the noes Place
[4:44] actually and Brother Andy and the
[4:45] Cliffords were there too and I think
[4:47] Andy had gone um down
[4:51] um brother maru's little track at the
[4:54] back of his house where he used to walk
[4:55] his dogs um around all through there
[4:59] that was before he was warned this
[5:03] was Andy went through there for some
[5:05] quiet time before Maru warned him not to
[5:08] walk through there for quiet time
[5:11] because that's where he takes his dogs
[5:13] every morning to do their business all
[5:16] through the whole area so Andy did
[5:19] complain about standing
[5:20] on smelly things as he walked through
[5:23] the this little Bush but anyway I
[5:25] digress from the story but Andy still
[5:28] managed to praise the Lord and get
[5:30] inspiration in that uh area and he came
[5:33] back with the words to the song Lead Me
[5:34] To The Rock and he he' had a bit of a
[5:36] tune so he and I um we sat down at
[5:40] maru's lounge and we pretty well strung
[5:42] the song together with the words he had
[5:43] and the Little tune he had in his mind
[5:45] and we we um strung the song together
[5:48] and it's pretty well as it is now as we
[5:51] sing it so let's um let's stand this
[5:53] morning we're going to sing lead me to

[41:33] dear God may it be a flame of fire in
[41:34] our lives and may you come and walk
[41:36] among us For Your Glory touch each life
[41:38] here those who may be sick and body or
[41:41] or whatever is going on in our lives may
[41:43] you raise us up be with us Lord uh guide
[41:46] us bring us in a closer walk with you
[41:48] grant it Lord we thank you be with all
[41:49] those who couldn't be here today as well
[41:51] be their portion in Jesus Christ's name
[41:53] we submit our lives and the service into
[41:54] your hands For Your Glory in Jesus
[41:56] Christ's name amen amen God bless you so
[41:59] you can have your seats this morning I
[42:01] got a few things I kind of kind of like
[42:03] a scrambled EGS so you know there's a
[42:05] few thoughts I just pray the Lord will
[42:07] weave it all together but I want to talk
[42:08] about God being a a comforter but then
[42:11] where do you get your comfort from and
[42:14] and uh and where are you driving there's
[42:16] kind of three very different kind of
[42:17] things here but um you know we read here
[42:21] uh David would say the name of the Lord
[42:23] is a strong tower the righteous runneth
[42:25] into it and is safe we live in a day
[42:28] where where the world we need comfort we
[42:31] need a place of safety a place of
[42:32] security a place where we can let off
[42:35] the pressure because you see anyone who
[42:37] gets into anything in any kind of a way
[42:40] they they go into it to let off the
[42:42] pressure someone will engross themselves
[42:44] in their work because they're letting
[42:46] off the pressure maybe at home or their
[42:47] own lives and someone will get into a
[42:49] hobby in a great way because they're
[42:50] letting off the pressure they're looking
[42:52] for a place of comfort people get into
[42:54] gaming they get into movies they get
[42:56] into you know cosplay and all these kind
[42:58] of fantasy things because they're trying
[43:00] to let off the pressure of the pressures
[43:02] of their own life because we know
[43:04] humanly we cannot deal with this world
[43:06] we cannot COPE in this neurotic Age The
[43:08] Prophet says we're not fit to live in
[43:10] this world we're not you know even now
[43:13] even the amount of information we
[43:14] receive in a day uh people used to say
[43:17] it would be a say a newspaper's worth of
[43:19] information but now because of
[43:20] smartphones the internet all those
[43:22] things the the the average person
[43:25] receives 30 newspapers of information
[43:27] today and it's actually information
[43:28] overload and so we need a place to let
[43:31] off the pressure amen we need a place of
[43:33] comfort amen that is actually a
[43:35] satisfying lasting Eternal Comfort not
[43:39] something that's just a moment that
[43:40] comes and goes and you know people they
[43:43] go watch their favorite shows they'll
[43:45] binge binge watch things and I remember
[43:47] doing that back in the day when that was
[43:49] actually a thing back when you know in
[43:50] the Stone Age when I used to be you know
[43:53] people would binge watch things what but
[43:55] what but why they're looking for Comfort
[43:57] they're looking looking for satisfaction
[43:59] they're looking for something that will
[44:00] calm their nerves that will kind of just
[44:03] just unret some tension that's what
[44:04] they're looking for but the name of the
[44:06] Lord is a strong tower and the righteous
[44:08] run
[44:10] runthe so there is a place of rest
[44:13] there's a place of comfort that we can
[44:16] go into this morning and not just come
[44:18] in and out but we can dwell there
[44:19] forever amen so as as um let's just read
[44:23] here just read another Psalm here you
[44:24] know it's amazing David if you look at
[44:26] the life of David he would he he needed
[44:29] a lot of comfort in his life he did not
[44:31] have a flowery bed of ease he did not
[44:33] have it easy he went through a great his
[44:36] life was a great time of transition
[44:38] where where where yo Saul was the first
[44:40] king of Israel had but we know how he
[44:42] ended up but now David would take the
[44:44] throne and and and and Israel would go
[44:46] through a time of transition from from
[44:48] from just having part of the land to
[44:50] securing the entire Promised Land but
[44:52] then also he would go through a great
[44:54] transition in his life cuz he went from
[44:56] a Shepherd boy he wasn't born in the
[44:58] palace you know look at this great
[45:00] changes he went through he went from a
[45:02] Shepherd boy that even his own father
[45:04] didn't see the Potentials in him his
[45:06] brothers sure didn't see the Potentials
[45:07] in him you know he was just a Shepherd
[45:09] boy and and and the reason I say they
[45:11] didn't see the Potentials in him is
[45:13] because when Samuel came to his house to
[45:15] anoint the king he wasn't invited he
[45:17] wasn't even considered right so so he
[45:19] went from a Shepherd boy that was that
[45:21] was not considered not even you know he
[45:23] wasn't even put in the he wasn't even in
[45:25] the running human ly but God had him in
[45:29] the running before the foundation of the
[45:30] world so God knew he was going to be
[45:32] king so he went from there then he went
[45:34] into the palace it looked like he could
[45:35] literally just step on the throne but
[45:37] then he had to go through a great
[45:38] transition time of being on the run
[45:41] because God needed to pour into him his
[45:44] word that we could draw strength from so
[45:47] you got to look at now maybe I'm just
[45:48] going to jump to this and I'll come back
[45:50] to it but but I just want to keep this
[45:51] picture in your mind now this car is not
[45:54] parked on the sidewalk it's driving
[45:58] okay where are you driving today your
[46:01] Christian walk liberal and legal is the
[46:04] sidewalk is actually a ditch I didn't
[46:06] have a picture of a ditch I could put a
[46:07] car in a ditch but I wanted something
[46:08] that's moving cuz we're all going in a
[46:10] direction and we all think we're on the
[46:13] road we do I mean let's be honest I
[46:16] think I'm
[46:17] right because the Bible says every man
[46:19] is right in his own eyes and my own eyes
[46:21] I'm right I mean let's be let's be
[46:23] truthful well we should be always
[46:25] truthful but you know what I mean we
[46:26] think think we are on the road down
[46:28] going down the King's Highway I'm right
[46:31] but what is your how is your walk
[46:33] affecting others see David David when he
[46:39] was walking with God wasn't on the
[46:41] sidewalk he was going up the King's
[46:43] Highway and his life influenced others
[46:46] because other men that were you know it
[46:48] says there you know when when when David
[46:50] went on the run and he went to the caves
[46:53] of abdull and said all that were in debt
[46:55] distress and discontented gather them M
[46:56] elves to David so they came into David's
[46:59] path well how did that affect them they
[47:01] became David's Mighty Men you see the
[47:04] anointing that was on him went upon them
[47:06] you see so it wasn't so he didn't run
[47:09] them over they became like him amen now
[47:13] if we are honest now this might be a
[47:15] slow kind of a service but I pray God
[47:17] would just let's just have a
[47:18] conversation yes you know you got to
[47:20] think about it would you want to be
[47:23] influenced by your own life if you were
[47:25] not you
[47:27] that's a good question don't you think
[47:29] would you want to be influenced if you
[47:31] weren't you would you want you to be
[47:33] your
[47:34] friend would you be happy to be around
[47:37] you would you be pleased to be in your
[47:39] company would you feel better being in
[47:42] your company or after you're in your own
[47:44] company I yeah this is not a DI I just
[47:47] want to ask you these questions how
[47:48] would you be positively impacted by your
[47:51] own life or would you be run over would
[47:52] you have to dive out of the way that
[47:54] here comes brother or sister so and so
[47:57] sure come on how's your
[48:00] driving if you could really you know you
[48:02] say well there's always something I want
[48:04] to work on absolutely God needs it but
[48:07] my question is in your current state
[48:10] don't don't put it way off in the future
[48:11] somewhere yes God's still working on me
[48:13] we're all work in progress okay we're
[48:15] all working progress we haven't made it
[48:17] yet we know we've made it when these
[48:18] bodies are changed we understand that
[48:20] right but would you want to hang around
[48:22] you now I'm not trying to put someone in
[48:24] some oh no one loves me or I don't even
[48:27] no would you want to be around you okay
[48:30] if the answer is yes praise God if the
[48:32] answer is no you say Lord change me amen
[48:35] that I exert a positive influence put me
[48:38] on the road Lord correct me you know
[48:40] there's um I don't know if that's no
[48:42] it's not a Tesla but oh maybe who cares
[48:44] anyway just say it can auto drive right
[48:47] the technology gets good enough that
[48:49] thing can drive I remember being where
[48:51] Christine and I were in Brisbane were in
[48:52] um Jeff and BET's Tesla and he said look
[48:54] I can show you it drives itself we're
[48:56] going on the motorway the thing was
[48:58] driving itself in order to be in the
[49:00] we've we've always had cloud
[49:03] computing right we've always had a
[49:05] server we've always had a hive mind or
[49:07] however you want to put it it's always
[49:08] been here but the problem is our
[49:10] Hardware gets get was born broken but
[49:14] then God is the actually the IT guy that
[49:16] works now if anyone's in it here praise
[49:18] God God bless you but you know it's more
[49:20] than a turning off and on again but God
[49:22] actually does a proper job right put it
[49:25] that way you see but we need to if we're
[49:29] we we need to look at how our lives are
[49:31] impacting each other and ourselves
[49:35] because iron can only sharpen iron if
[49:38] the Iron's in the right position amen
[49:40] like at work and cover your ears honey
[49:42] bear but at work they've got these
[49:43] automatic sharpeners you pull the knife
[49:44] through you've got to set the blade
[49:47] right before you do it if you don't set
[49:49] it right then the blade will be oh boy
[49:52] you've got a serrated knife when you
[49:53] didn't start with a serrated knife you
[49:55] know it's terrible it's a real train
[49:57] wreck because because the knife isn't
[49:59] sit in the sharpner right now the expert
[50:02] here would say no it's never going to
[50:04] sharpen it right and true but what I'm
[50:06] trying to say is if your life is not set
[50:08] right you're going to sharpen each other
[50:10] wrong right if you're now no one thinks
[50:13] they're liberal or legal everyone thinks
[50:15] you're down the middle right let's
[50:18] be I think I'm I think I'm fine I think
[50:22] I'm right I think you know I think I'm
[50:23] right down the middle but am I David
[50:25] said cleanse me of my secret faults Lord
[50:27] oh yes Lord right so we all have secret
[50:30] faults there's things that in our life
[50:32] there's blind spots that we are not
[50:34] aware that we have but when we allow the
[50:37] light of God to shine upon us if we are
[50:39] genuinely sincere and we genuinely want
[50:42] to know God will show us but if we don't
[50:45] really want to know he won't show us but
[50:47] I prayed I wanted to know but you didn't
[50:49] but what see God doesn't hear this he
[50:51] hears this and when this means business
[50:54] he means business but if this don't mean
[50:56] business you can you can pray you can
[50:58] fast you can do all you want outwardly
[51:00] it looks all very well but if this
[51:01] doesn't mean
[51:03] business you're going to hit something
[51:05] on the sidewalk amen okay so let's just
[51:08] keep that in mind
[51:10] amen praise the Lord now so David David
[51:14] went through this time of transition as
[51:16] I said he didn't um his mighty men
[51:19] didn't get run over by him he they
[51:22] became like him the anointing upon him
[51:24] that was on him went upon them
[51:27] right but then when David and his
[51:29] Humanity got off the path and he took
[51:32] bash Sheba killed Uriah and all those
[51:34] things that was a train wreck why what
[51:37] happened he he lost connection with his
[51:40] Shepherd his source of comfort was
[51:43] forgotten he let the pressures of Life
[51:46] take him off the path you see cuz there
[51:49] is he is the Lord is a strong tower he
[51:52] doesn't move a tower doesn't move but we
[51:54] move remember Israel God never left
[51:57] Israel Israel left God right and this
[52:00] Christian world today has left God
[52:01] they're crying out God why why why and
[52:03] he say well read my word and you'll see
[52:05] come back to me come back come home come
[52:08] back to the Strong Tower it's great this
[52:10] place of Refuge it's worth it amen so
[52:13] you see David when he was in his
[52:15] Humanity he didn't let the card his
[52:17] source of comfort didn't keep him on the
[52:19] path but his Humanity took him off and
[52:22] he started running people
[52:24] over and Nathan came to him and gave him
[52:26] the parable of the shepher you know the
[52:28] two um one had one sheep one had a whole
[52:30] bunch you know all those things and and
[52:32] Nathan said because of the because of
[52:36] this the sword will never leave your
[52:37] house you're forgiven but the sword will
[52:39] never leave your house so unfortunately
[52:42] his life because of his position and
[52:44] even as an individual even you know as
[52:47] mothers fathers whatever our lives have
[52:51] impact right I think it's one in
[52:53] Newton's law every action has a opposite
[52:57] reaction right so so however so if I
[53:00] crash my car it's going to have impact
[53:02] on me it's going to have impact on
[53:04] whoever I run into even if I hit a lamp
[53:06] post that thing's still going to get
[53:07] fixed there's still damage
[53:11] right so we all we we can
[53:15] never um get rid of you know this world
[53:18] does not want responsibility for its
[53:21] actions this world does not want
[53:22] responsibility that's why they get
[53:24] vaccines for so people can live all kind
[53:26] of different Lifestyles you know they
[53:28] have all different things people have
[53:30] now to try and mitigate
[53:32] responsibility but God still holds
[53:35] everyone accountable and God will hold
[53:36] everyone accountable so we've got to
[53:38] realize how we
[53:40] drive is going to impact somewh it's
[53:42] going to it it impacted David and imp so
[53:46] it didn't just you know so we want to
[53:49] Lord may we just be down the middle amen
[53:51] all right so we'll come back to that but
[53:52] you see he left his source of comfort
[53:55] his Strong Tower and he started
[53:59] self-driving all right so now he says to
[54:02] the chief musician upon um niggan
[54:06] however you say that a Psalm of David
[54:07] Hear My Cry Oh God attend unto my prayer
[54:09] from the end of the Earth will I cry
[54:11] unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed
[54:12] lead me to the Rock that's higher than I
[54:14] for thou Hast been a shelter for me and
[54:16] a strong tower from the enemy I'll abide
[54:19] in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust
[54:21] in the covet of thy Wings CA see this
[54:24] was David this was David's heart and God
[54:26] took him through incredible things to
[54:30] show us that truly the Lord is a strong
[54:33] tower he is a City of Refuge that it's
[54:35] not in you know people have it in you
[54:38] know peaceful times a everything's fine
[54:40] I'm in my City of Refuge no it's when
[54:42] Trouble Comes what is our comfort coming
[54:46] what are we drawing strength from amen
[54:48] what are we drawing strength from you
[54:51] see many people they take comfort in
[54:54] many different things
[54:56] people take comfort in being
[54:58] young right I'm young I've got years
[55:01] ahead of me I've got my whole life in
[55:03] front of me so they take comfort sure
[55:05] things may be hard right now but I'm
[55:06] young I've got years ahead of me people
[55:07] take comfort in that people take comfort
[55:10] in money they draw strength from their
[55:11] money well I've got this paid off I've
[55:14] got all this in the bank I've got all
[55:15] these things so therefore they they they
[55:18] think they've got Comfort right people
[55:22] people take comfort in their position
[55:25] well I'm the head of this or own this or
[55:27] you know this is my job title this is my
[55:29] job description so they take comfort in
[55:31] those things right they take people take
[55:33] comfort in their
[55:35] intelligence I'm smart I can do it
[55:38] they're taking comfort see they're
[55:39] relying see what are we relying on
[55:41] that's our comfort right or people take
[55:44] as I've said before they take comfort in
[55:45] their
[55:47] hobby or in entertainment people take
[55:51] comfort in being part of a group just
[55:53] like brother Jimmy was saying on
[55:54] Wednesday he was so interested in what
[55:57] his friends thought of him that was his
[55:59] comfort what do my peers think of me
[56:01] they'll leave you as you
[56:03] heard this is all sand I'm talking about
[56:05] sand just comes and goes all these
[56:07] things there's nothing stable in these
[56:08] things being part of a group you know
[56:11] people can take comfort well I come to
[56:12] Shak
[56:14] Tabernacle there'll come a day this
[56:16] place won't be
[56:18] here could happen right where's your
[56:21] comfort then is it now then would you
[56:24] just have comfort in the good old days
[56:27] no your comfort must be in Christ he is
[56:30] your comfort right so just being part of
[56:32] a group it's not going to it's not going
[56:34] to hold you when you're alone right see
[56:39] amen what your friends think of you
[56:42] being in company you know all those
[56:43] things they are they are sources of
[56:45] comfort now David's Comfort was the Lord
[56:48] amen now we understand that that Joshua
[56:52] would would would place I don't know if
[56:54] I don't have the list here but but Moses
[56:56] instructed him or the Lord told him that
[56:58] that there would be six Cities of Refuge
[57:00] in the promised land so there was six
[57:03] places of comfort that people could go
[57:06] to just say they killed someone
[57:08] accidentally you know and they could
[57:10] flee into these places that the Avenger
[57:12] of blood could not harm them when they
[57:14] were inside and so when they're inside
[57:16] they fled there and they could plead
[57:18] their cause and then people could people
[57:20] in that place had to let them dwell
[57:22] among them so that person when they're
[57:24] outside the city had no Comfort they had
[57:27] no security they knew the enemy could
[57:29] get them he had legal rights to do so
[57:31] but then when as soon as they stepped in
[57:33] the gate they had Comfort right because
[57:35] the enemy couldn't get them they were
[57:37] safe in that place so their their
[57:39] comfort maybe maybe if they are fast and
[57:41] they're running to the city they could
[57:43] think well I have comfort in my speed
[57:45] maybe they're long-distance Runner I've
[57:47] got comfort that I'm a longdistance
[57:49] runner or maybe they had a horse I've
[57:50] got comfort in my horse right but all
[57:53] those things now I may be laboring this
[57:55] but I want you to think about what's
[57:56] your comfort in yeah where are you
[57:58] drawing strength from today amen now but
[58:02] then as soon as they got into the city
[58:04] that City wasn't based on their ability
[58:07] or what they possessed the the merits of
[58:10] the city was in the city alone right now
[58:13] Christ is the seventh City of Refuge
[58:15] right so it's not in our ability that we
[58:17] draw comfort from well people draw
[58:19] Comfort well I was raised in a Christian
[58:21] home well I was baptized all those
[58:23] things are good well I go to a good
[58:25] church that is wonderful I'm so happy
[58:27] for you well I'm I yeah I've heard the
[58:29] message of the hour praise God I'm glad
[58:31] God has sent you the light of the age
[58:33] you across your path but the comfort is
[58:36] to know him as life amen to know him as
[58:38] life see not to know about him not to be
[58:40] associated with him but to know him as
[58:43] life amen that's the real source of
[58:45] comfort amen
[58:47] now praise the Lord now if we ever come
[58:50] to Christ we can really let off the
[58:53] pressure amen
[58:57] okay well I don't know what's happening
[58:58] but it's not going up there now but if
[59:00] you ever come to Christ you can let off
[59:01] the pressure cause oh here we are
[59:04] because it's all over then just settle
[59:05] in it's God's provided place of safety
[59:07] where God said the name of the Lord is
[59:09] the mighty tower the righteous run into
[59:11] it and are safe in a time of sickness
[59:13] when sickness strikes and the doctor
[59:14] says there's nothing else I can do about
[59:16] it don't build up pressure let off the
[59:18] pressure call your pastor let him anoint
[59:20] you with uh in oil uh and pray over
[59:23] prayer of faith he'll save the sick let
[59:24] off the precious SE is our re Refuge
[59:27] while you're in this Refuge you've got a
[59:30] right to do anything that's in the
[59:31] Refuge and Christ is our refuge and
[59:34] everything we have need of is in him
[59:35] amen and sickness don't build up
[59:37] pressure let off pressure you say well I
[59:39] wonder brother Bram you don't wonder you
[59:41] just let the pressure off commit your
[59:43] case to God and go on as if it was all
[59:45] over don't build up pressure let off
[59:48] pressure why because he should be your
[59:50] comfort amen that the word of God is our
[59:53] strength and our comfort praise the Lord
[59:56] now I'm just going to come back to this
[59:58] a bit
[1:00:00] again have I broken something this must
[1:00:03] be
[1:00:04] childproof anyway can you go to the car
[1:00:07] picture I don't know what I've done oh
[1:00:10] here we
[1:00:12] go okay now brother Braham tells us very
[1:00:18] clearly now I just want to go into our
[1:00:20] walk okay now everyone thinks you're in
[1:00:23] the middle of the road as I said this
[1:00:25] morning now
[1:00:26] the Lord Jesus has never given a complex
[1:00:29] to
[1:00:29] anyone okay the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:33] doesn't give
[1:00:34] complexes it doesn't cause trouble in a
[1:00:37] negative way to the individual right no
[1:00:40] the Lord Jesus has never done anyone any
[1:00:42] harm amen not a single person has been
[1:00:45] harmed by him okay amen no one has ever
[1:00:49] that's truly come in contact with him
[1:00:52] has any resentful feelings towards him
[1:00:55] right but it's religion that kills it's
[1:00:58] religion that harms religion is of the
[1:01:02] devil if you take that as a sound by
[1:01:04] whatever you want to do but religion now
[1:01:06] walking with the Lord true Christianity
[1:01:09] is not
[1:01:10] religion right but a lot of what
[1:01:12] religion is is is is is pretending to be
[1:01:17] Christianity right because the both can
[1:01:20] look very similar so for example brother
[1:01:22] brah would say I think it's in God of
[1:01:24] this evil age he said he said
[1:01:26] paralleling Cain and Abel's worship with
[1:01:28] God Abel was worshiping by Revelation
[1:01:31] Cain was worshiping by intellectual
[1:01:33] understanding he said both of them
[1:01:35] Spirits is in the Tabernacle this
[1:01:36] morning amen so outwardly it would look
[1:01:39] very similar people would dress the same
[1:01:41] they'd act the same they'd proba say
[1:01:43] Amen at the same time they'd have the
[1:01:45] same kind of songs but one is religion
[1:01:48] the other is actually
[1:01:50] Christianity okay so we must never get
[1:01:53] confused by the two though both though
[1:01:55] the both are very much the same now
[1:01:58] religion has been the worst sidewalk
[1:02:01] driver in
[1:02:02] history right it is purposely because
[1:02:05] it's the enemy perverting what God has
[1:02:07] created God created us to walk with him
[1:02:11] the devil perverted it that we would
[1:02:12] walk with a religion two very different
[1:02:15] things right so now religion is the
[1:02:18] sidewalk driver it is actually set up
[1:02:20] too if there was a person on that
[1:02:22] sidewalk and that was religion it would
[1:02:24] speed up and hit that person oh I've got
[1:02:26] another one you know and sadly that's
[1:02:28] why this world has been hardened against
[1:02:31] the word of God is because of religion
[1:02:34] and what people have done in the name of
[1:02:36] religion you look at you look at um um
[1:02:39] Judas for example now it's amazing Jesus
[1:02:41] allowed him to be the treasure knowing
[1:02:42] he was a devil but yet if you take him
[1:02:44] and the you it's amazing how the world
[1:02:47] always puts up if someone is a Christian
[1:02:49] and they've done a crime they always put
[1:02:51] there a Christian in the newspapers when
[1:02:52] they put the what they've done they
[1:02:54] never say this atheist did this or this
[1:02:57] or this person or this agnostic did this
[1:02:59] today no this person belongs to this
[1:03:01] church and they did this why because
[1:03:04] well one that person needs a real
[1:03:05] experience number one but two the devil
[1:03:08] does that to paint a bad picture of what
[1:03:11] we
[1:03:12] believe sure and there's been real train
[1:03:14] wrecks that have happened in the name of
[1:03:16] the message I I we can't defend those
[1:03:18] things you know we can't hey we can't
[1:03:20] say that those things are acceptable no
[1:03:21] a lot of evil has been done but what is
[1:03:24] it it's unconverted people people
[1:03:26] driving a religious car right people who
[1:03:29] are driving on the sidewalk you know
[1:03:31] even even the Apostle Paul says in the
[1:03:33] book of Acts he tells the people um he
[1:03:35] says he says that after my departing
[1:03:38] Grievous wolves among you will rise up
[1:03:41] rending the flock he says I have warned
[1:03:43] you for three years day and night with
[1:03:45] tears that this would happen could you
[1:03:47] imagine no doubt those men who heard the
[1:03:50] Apostle Paul say that and this was the
[1:03:51] last time they would have seen him alive
[1:03:53] and they embraced him and cried and the
[1:03:55] Bible says they s's neck and they were
[1:03:56] sad when he left but he said among you
[1:03:59] no I'm not pointing at you but I'm
[1:04:01] saying he would be pointing like at them
[1:04:03] right okay are we all with me okay yes
[1:04:05] you know but among you some of you are
[1:04:08] going to be like this you're not going
[1:04:10] to be driving down the road and helping
[1:04:12] people your life is going to be
[1:04:14] negatively running people over in the
[1:04:17] name of the Lord cuz it's amazing when
[1:04:20] human leadership's taken out of the way
[1:04:22] as brother Johnny demoff said at our
[1:04:23] first Camp the hearts of all men are
[1:04:25] made manifest right so what's truly in
[1:04:28] people comes out when leadership is
[1:04:31] taken out of the way like the're saying
[1:04:33] is when the cats away the mice do
[1:04:36] play right so
[1:04:39] now sadly this has been the case down
[1:04:42] Through the Ages now does this um does
[1:04:44] this mean what we believe is wrong
[1:04:46] absolutely not unfortunately where the
[1:04:49] truth is the devil wants to try and
[1:04:51] either discredit it you know disprove it
[1:04:55] or try explain it away he always does
[1:04:57] those things that's his that that's the
[1:04:58] way he does things so a so a religious
[1:05:02] person will be on the
[1:05:05] sidewalk now the and what it is is so
[1:05:09] it's not the Lord Jesus that causes
[1:05:11] people to run people over in the name of
[1:05:13] Christianity no no no no no it's see see
[1:05:16] it's amazing and it's not even really
[1:05:18] the devil that does it it's their own
[1:05:21] person it's an unconverted person
[1:05:24] sometimes we give the devil too much
[1:05:26] credit oh the devil made me do that
[1:05:29] really and he's thinking well you're
[1:05:31] chalking that one under my name he
[1:05:33] doesn't care you know because if he can
[1:05:35] get you to blame him instead of you
[1:05:37] looking at yourself in the light of
[1:05:38] God's word and actually letting God
[1:05:40] change you then he's got you how he
[1:05:42] wants you right but if we really say
[1:05:44] Lord search my heart amen you see Lord
[1:05:47] change me like David Nathan went in
[1:05:49] front of him to correct them saying hey
[1:05:51] you're the man in the parable David the
[1:05:53] one you wanted to have killed you caused
[1:05:55] it you're the guy and what did he say
[1:05:58] Lord create in me a clean heart oh Lord
[1:06:00] in other words Lord put me back in the
[1:06:01] middle of the road Lord Jesus amen so so
[1:06:05] you know so someone who is liberal or
[1:06:07] someone who is legal they cause Carnage
[1:06:10] but yet they think they're in the middle
[1:06:12] of the road it's amazing how someone see
[1:06:14] if we could if see we can't see this
[1:06:17] whole picture here right but what if in
[1:06:19] front of so this is I guess this is our
[1:06:21] car right we're on the road this guy's
[1:06:24] parked facing the other way I don't know
[1:06:25] where he's going because it's a oneway
[1:06:26] street okay spiritually speaking okay
[1:06:29] are are you with me now we can't see
[1:06:32] this whole picture right so what if to
[1:06:34] our right just out of the shot there's
[1:06:36] just a massive traffic jam four lanes
[1:06:40] wide you ain't moving nowhere you can't
[1:06:42] even get a bicycle between the cars so
[1:06:45] this guy would be reasoning hey man I'm
[1:06:47] on the sidewalk because of all this is
[1:06:48] going on I need to
[1:06:51] travel both think about
[1:06:54] themselves right but there' be reasoning
[1:06:56] no doubt in this guy's mind where I'm
[1:06:58] driving is correct because of what's
[1:07:01] going on you see and this is the big
[1:07:04] danger is when something comes in people
[1:07:06] humanly pull one way or the other based
[1:07:09] on you could say their default setting
[1:07:12] right so if someone is someone is
[1:07:14] liberal they'll say well it
[1:07:17] doesn't you know love will cover it who
[1:07:20] cares I'm fine I'm driving right like
[1:07:23] you know like um aen took the Babylonian
[1:07:25] garment in the gold wedge right he
[1:07:28] thought hey I've been fighting for this
[1:07:29] this is mine who cares what Joshua MOS
[1:07:32] you God told us through Joshua I'm just
[1:07:35] going on they have to deal with it I'm
[1:07:38] just going through something we've got
[1:07:39] to be very aware how we impact one
[1:07:41] another yes amen right and so and so
[1:07:44] they will reason that way now a a um a
[1:07:48] legalistic person will drive over people
[1:07:51] on the sidewalk and they'll say well
[1:07:54] that person wasn't SE
[1:07:56] that person wasn't really a Christian
[1:07:58] and if they really were they would have
[1:08:00] overcome that and I have a right to
[1:08:02] drive here because I'm in the message
[1:08:04] and I'm I'm I'm living the word out and
[1:08:07] and well then then how do they impact
[1:08:09] people negatively attitudes comments
[1:08:12] that P that sister's dress is too tight
[1:08:14] it's too short this is this and mine's
[1:08:16] long and no we're not here to wear
[1:08:19] burkers okay as long as it's below the
[1:08:21] knee and you have a bit of a sleeve
[1:08:24] praise God that's what the problem said
[1:08:26] you know some questions he got I think
[1:08:27] he kind of bulked say why are people
[1:08:29] asking me these things where's the
[1:08:31] personal relationship leading where's
[1:08:33] the Holy Ghost leading these people you
[1:08:35] know but you see someone who's
[1:08:36] legalistic just wants a tick boox what
[1:08:38] do I have to do then I'm in you have to
[1:08:40] fall in love with Jesus Christ you got
[1:08:42] to fall in love with his word and walk
[1:08:44] with him right are we all together amen
[1:08:47] so so both of these things will cause
[1:08:51] people to get run over you know brother
[1:08:54] BR makes a statement that you know our
[1:08:55] attitudes and things we do can knock
[1:08:57] people out of their healing and the and
[1:09:00] the legal ones say well that's the
[1:09:02] Liberals causing trouble in the church
[1:09:03] that's why people get knock no it's the
[1:09:05] attitude of the legalistic is just as
[1:09:07] bad it's just as damaging as someone
[1:09:10] who's liberal saying well it doesn't
[1:09:11] really matter and you know God is such a
[1:09:13] good god he's a very good God he cares
[1:09:17] but do you care I think if we had his
[1:09:19] heart this this whole world would be
[1:09:21] transformed if we thought like he did if
[1:09:23] we acted like he did B see who are
[1:09:25] driving on the sidewalk think they're
[1:09:27] acting like
[1:09:28] him God give us the mind of
[1:09:31] Christ amen amen you see and what
[1:09:34] happens is people driving on the
[1:09:36] sidewalk causes people to develop
[1:09:38] complexes what wouldn't you get a bit of
[1:09:41] a complex if you're going to just come
[1:09:43] out of this house you may be going to
[1:09:45] walk walk down the street to the dairy
[1:09:47] saying and this car just goes right past
[1:09:49] you and you nearly get run over wouldn't
[1:09:52] that Dev bit of a fear in you bit of a
[1:09:54] complex you can't the same anymore
[1:09:56] you've got to you know because you
[1:09:57] nearly got run
[1:09:58] over think about it you know you're just
[1:10:00] minding your own business you've walked
[1:10:02] down this driveway many times before and
[1:10:03] suddenly this big white car just goes
[1:10:05] right past you and you got to like go
[1:10:07] this and then the trauma sets in what a
[1:10:09] complex sets in because of how someone
[1:10:11] else was driving if they were just
[1:10:13] driving just a little bit on the road
[1:10:14] there would never been the problem right
[1:10:17] and so what happens is we can if we're
[1:10:19] driving on the sidewalk we can cause
[1:10:20] complexes in one another sure
[1:10:25] I'm just letting it soak in a bit so we
[1:10:27] got to think about it how is my life
[1:10:29] impacting others are they better off
[1:10:32] because I've been around them or are
[1:10:34] they more negative are they more
[1:10:35] sarcastic are they more
[1:10:39] condescending you know do they love the
[1:10:41] Lord
[1:10:43] less now I don't know if everyone's
[1:10:45] going to go around with a survey with
[1:10:46] everyone can you fill the survey out I
[1:10:48] need to know but think about how is your
[1:10:51] how is your how is your walk affecting
[1:10:53] your children
[1:10:55] right now parents can have a perfect
[1:10:57] walk doesn't mean there won't be trouble
[1:10:59] in the home we know that right but do
[1:11:02] they see in our lives a sincere love for
[1:11:06] God do they I well of course they do
[1:11:10] because I'm
[1:11:12] right no no do do they see it is there
[1:11:16] actually a genuine or is it just going
[1:11:18] through the motions kind of a you know
[1:11:20] it's one thing I've got to break out of
[1:11:21] constantly just going through the
[1:11:23] motions this cancer start sign it's a
[1:11:26] thing I'm Just Born This Way sure but
[1:11:30] I'm more than a
[1:11:32] conqueror there is nothing God can't
[1:11:34] change am amen well I'm Moody I'm all
[1:11:38] this just come into the City of Refuge
[1:11:40] yes sir enjoy it's enjoy it everything
[1:11:43] it is it's a great place right well I
[1:11:45] just can't overcome me no but the Holy
[1:11:47] Ghost can right brother Ram says that
[1:11:49] the Holy Ghost takes all the counts out
[1:11:52] of a person that's what he does he's the
[1:11:54] can't remover hallelujah amen brother
[1:11:58] Arman wouldn't that be a great thing in
[1:11:59] your carpet cleaning business all those
[1:12:01] stains there there wouldn't be one Gone
[1:12:04] Gone why because he's the can't remover
[1:12:06] right but it's reasoning that makes us
[1:12:08] think the counts must
[1:12:10] remain so keeps us on the sidewalk I
[1:12:13] yeah I trust we're all happy today and
[1:12:15] together and thinking about these things
[1:12:17] amen so now we can never see an a
[1:12:19] legalistic person will have a cold and
[1:12:21] different nature towards someone else
[1:12:24] who's not driving driving the same way
[1:12:25] they're driving or their skirts too too
[1:12:29] short or it's too long or it's too puffy
[1:12:32] or it's this well they're this way see
[1:12:35] people driving on the sidewalk compare
[1:12:38] themselves people draw comfort from
[1:12:40] comparing their own lives with others
[1:12:43] well I'm driving a better car or I've
[1:12:45] got a better job my family's more
[1:12:47] together I have this I I'm glad I'm not
[1:12:49] that
[1:12:50] family and God has ordained their walk
[1:12:54] just like he's ordained your walk right
[1:12:57] and God's proving himself in their lives
[1:12:59] just as much as I trust he's proving
[1:13:01] himself in your
[1:13:03] life amen we all have different walks
[1:13:06] God's not a cookie
[1:13:08] cutter amen yeah and I'm thankful that
[1:13:11] all of our testimonies are not the same
[1:13:14] I'm thankful our lives are not equally
[1:13:16] all the same I'm glad this is not some
[1:13:17] communistic idea that everyone must be
[1:13:19] the same no we must of course be changed
[1:13:23] to match the word but our walk and what
[1:13:25] he's taken us from what we go through
[1:13:27] it's all tailor made that he can prove
[1:13:30] himself but someone who's on the
[1:13:32] sidewalk the Lord's like why are you
[1:13:33] driving over there come back onto the
[1:13:36] road you know stop dodging people on the
[1:13:39] sidewalk and well had had he Dodge
[1:13:41] people on the sidewalk you keep clashing
[1:13:43] with
[1:13:43] everyone that's how you know you're on
[1:13:45] the sidewalk who's ever driven down a
[1:13:48] road when there's no traffic and you got
[1:13:50] to dodge people no but then you look to
[1:13:52] your left or right and there's heaps of
[1:13:53] people walking on the sidewalk imagine
[1:13:55] driving there you'd be toting you get
[1:13:58] frustrated people get frustrated on the
[1:14:00] sidewalk you know road rage happens if
[1:14:02] you're trying to drive in the wrong
[1:14:04] spot even if you get stuck in the mud
[1:14:06] road rage can
[1:14:07] happen right you can be just off you can
[1:14:10] be just off the road then you can be
[1:14:11] stuck even on Long Grass that's slippery
[1:14:13] you can be stuck when I went with
[1:14:15] christe and I went up to Oakland you
[1:14:17] know brother John was taking us around
[1:14:18] and we had to go get the keys for the
[1:14:20] church anyway we were we were just off
[1:14:22] the uh kind of long kind of driveway go
[1:14:24] brother Andrew Donaldson's house and he
[1:14:26] pulls his uh van off onto this grass we
[1:14:29] were stuck
[1:14:31] man I was I was jumping on the back of
[1:14:33] the van this just before church was
[1:14:34] saying jumping on the back of the van
[1:14:35] trying to put some weight I thought
[1:14:37] Quinn you've abandoned me you know I I
[1:14:40] can't yeah I wasn't strong enough you H
[1:14:42] fat enough to anyway so I got to work on
[1:14:44] that maybe but anyway we got another car
[1:14:48] and we got to church but it was just it
[1:14:50] was literally and it looked fine grass
[1:14:52] nice green grass beautiful
[1:14:55] soon as we hit that thing man we were
[1:14:58] done it can look so reasonable to drive
[1:15:01] on the sidewalk because of what other
[1:15:03] people are doing I'm going to prove them
[1:15:05] this is a traffic jam pered I'm going to
[1:15:07] prove them and drive this way do what I
[1:15:10] want you get frustrated because you'll
[1:15:14] be hitting people or they'll be ducking
[1:15:16] out of you and they'll give you funny
[1:15:18] looks why did they say that why did they
[1:15:21] mention that why are they why are they
[1:15:23] talking about these things that's it's
[1:15:25] like someone's driving you know you
[1:15:27] never you never get normal looks if
[1:15:29] you're driving in the wrong spot
[1:15:31] especially in New Zealand we very much
[1:15:32] stay in the lane right stay in the lane
[1:15:36] right we're very much just we just do
[1:15:37] this kind of thing so you get funnier
[1:15:39] looks probably here than maybe in other
[1:15:41] parts of the world but even in other
[1:15:42] parts of the world well actually in
[1:15:44] every part of the world if you're slowly
[1:15:46] driving you're about to hit a pedestrian
[1:15:47] they'll be looking at you
[1:15:49] funny first it'll be whoa what's going
[1:15:52] on second it'll be why are you driving
[1:15:54] here especially when you look you know
[1:15:56] when you look someone in the eye when
[1:15:57] you're driving they like nearly hit you
[1:15:59] and stuff and you see them and they see
[1:16:00] you right and they pretend not to see
[1:16:02] you but but they see
[1:16:04] you it's the same thing in the Christian
[1:16:06] walk you nearly hit someone cuz you're
[1:16:08] in the wrong spot you pretend oh I'm
[1:16:10] just going on I'm serving God no you're
[1:16:13] driving in the wrong spot I'm probably
[1:16:15] laboring this but I really I just trust
[1:16:16] it really soaks in real super deep you
[1:16:18] know that we must be careful where we're
[1:16:20] driving
[1:16:22] see religion gives complex says the
[1:16:25] blood of Jesus Christ has never given no
[1:16:27] one a
[1:16:28] complex you get love amen
[1:16:33] Amen brother Bram says when a man said
[1:16:35] he could cast out he said I stood a few
[1:16:37] weeks ago where there was a big tent
[1:16:39] erected not slamming uh God forgive
[1:16:41] where a man said he can cast out evil
[1:16:43] spirits which I have no doubt by that
[1:16:44] but evil spirits are not cast out by
[1:16:46] cruel indifferent living the most
[1:16:48] powerful weapon there is in the world is
[1:16:50] love amen right so if you're on the
[1:16:53] sidewalk I'll say you're actually
[1:16:55] that's cruel
[1:16:56] indifference I'm doing what I want I
[1:16:58] don't care what the rules say I don't
[1:17:00] care what other people are doing I don't
[1:17:02] care who comes out that driveway I'm
[1:17:03] driving I'm serving God they can do what
[1:17:06] they want oh no no no no if you really
[1:17:08] have a genuine Love in Your Heart you'll
[1:17:10] be actually genuinely concerned about
[1:17:12] everyone around you
[1:17:14] amen right amen amen you're hitting gaps
[1:17:18] in an intersection is because you're
[1:17:21] frustrated if you have genuine Love in
[1:17:23] Your Heart praise God I'm in the car
[1:17:25] longer Lord hallelujah let's have a
[1:17:27] conversation how we do yeah and you have
[1:17:28] a prayer meeting in your car who who
[1:17:30] enjoys that or you put on a song you're
[1:17:33] talking to whoever you're driving with
[1:17:34] you get it's being stuck in traffic is
[1:17:37] quality time you may not think that but
[1:17:40] it's actually quality time why because
[1:17:42] you're there one-on-one with God or
[1:17:45] whoever you're driving with or
[1:17:46] whatever's going on you can enjoy you
[1:17:48] know it's quality time well I don't
[1:17:50] perceive it that way well maybe let's
[1:17:52] just let our perceptions change a bit
[1:17:55] just like every day is a gift Monday is
[1:17:56] still as just as great as a
[1:18:00] Friday because it's a gift of God praise
[1:18:03] the Lord I trying to anyway Hallelujah
[1:18:07] but you see the Christian always looks
[1:18:08] at the Unseen things every Redemptive
[1:18:10] blessing of God is unseen here's the
[1:18:12] whole armor of of the Christian love joy
[1:18:16] Faith longsuffering goodness meekness
[1:18:17] gentleness patience it's all unseen
[1:18:19] forces that works in the heart of a
[1:18:21] Believer am mean that's right we look at
[1:18:23] things we do not see if we if we are the
[1:18:26] children of Abraham then we don't walk
[1:18:28] by sight we walk by faith for Abraham
[1:18:31] walked by faith and called those things
[1:18:33] which were not as though they were
[1:18:34] because God said so so now to drive to
[1:18:39] drive on the sidewalk you are driving by
[1:18:42] sight amen you're walking by sight so
[1:18:44] how people treat you you will treat them
[1:18:47] not by faith not by looking beyond their
[1:18:49] fault and maybe seeing their need you
[1:18:51] know someone I've never seen a happy
[1:18:54] person who's
[1:18:55] injured never never seen a happy even a
[1:18:59] drunk person who's injured becomes very
[1:19:01] unhappy right so they start maybe crying
[1:19:05] they start expressing themselves
[1:19:07] differently to when they're not injured
[1:19:09] who's with who's ever seen someone who's
[1:19:10] cut themselves really bad or maybe not
[1:19:12] so bad you know or something's happen
[1:19:15] maybe maybe got a big bruise they fell
[1:19:17] they something happened who's ever seen
[1:19:19] they don't react the same way to before
[1:19:21] it happened right I know well that's
[1:19:24] obvious yeah yes but what about in the
[1:19:26] spiritual now what about in the
[1:19:28] spiritual someone's maybe been injured
[1:19:30] maybe the devil's fighting them maybe
[1:19:31] maybe something's going on in their
[1:19:33] Spirit you can't see but they're
[1:19:35] reacting because of something that's
[1:19:37] going on within them now they're a
[1:19:38] Believer you're a Believer but they've
[1:19:40] been wounded by
[1:19:41] something right do we just if they were
[1:19:45] physically if we could physically see
[1:19:47] spiritual wounds I think we would treat
[1:19:50] one another with a far greater care like
[1:19:52] if we saw someone maybe maybe
[1:19:55] spiritually they're an ICU right now
[1:19:57] maybe they've lost a limb maybe blood
[1:20:00] and arteries going and their blood is
[1:20:01] just spurting across imagine if that was
[1:20:03] what we could see spiritual wounds we
[1:20:06] would attend to that person we'd start
[1:20:08] praying we'd show them care we'd show
[1:20:10] them consideration the first question
[1:20:12] would be like well well well I mean if
[1:20:14] someone's badly injured but you know of
[1:20:15] course you don't ask are you okay
[1:20:17] because you can see they're not okay but
[1:20:18] a child comes they're crying like
[1:20:20] William hurts himself on that starts
[1:20:21] crying well the first thing are you okay
[1:20:23] you picked them up you give them some
[1:20:25] comfort right then you look at what's
[1:20:27] wrong you assess it and all those things
[1:20:29] and you know why but you start
[1:20:31] administering Comfort now if you're on
[1:20:34] the sidewalk you can't give Comfort on
[1:20:37] the
[1:20:38] sidewalk spiritually speaking because
[1:20:41] you're doing your own thing they
[1:20:43] shouldn't have been there it's their
[1:20:44] fault and sometimes it is our fault it's
[1:20:46] human error sure we're human by the way
[1:20:49] news flash everyone we you're human okay
[1:20:52] but you see someone who's actually on
[1:20:54] the road can actually administer Comfort
[1:20:56] why because it's the love of God keeps
[1:20:57] you down the middle amen right if you
[1:21:00] have the love of God in your heart then
[1:21:01] you can administer comfort then the
[1:21:04] comforter that comes into your life can
[1:21:06] be expressed out of your life so what if
[1:21:08] we saw each other
[1:21:10] spiritually I mean physically as we
[1:21:12] would be spiritually I think we would
[1:21:14] actually have a lot more we'll probably
[1:21:16] have a lot of prayer meetings we would
[1:21:19] show a lot more care and consideration
[1:21:20] oh well that's them and then no no they
[1:21:23] just lost an arm a big dog just ripped
[1:21:26] off a part of they're missing some
[1:21:28] limbs they need serious help you're not
[1:21:31] going to push someone down that's that's
[1:21:33] being taken whenever I see an ambulance
[1:21:35] I think Lord help that person Lord help
[1:21:38] the ambulance staff Lord may they get to
[1:21:40] hospital give them another chance Lord
[1:21:42] you know but we should have to me we
[1:21:44] should have the same kind of attitude
[1:21:45] towards someone who's spiritually unwell
[1:21:47] shouldn't be well oh they deserve oh
[1:21:49] look at what well well it's because
[1:21:51] where they're walking they deserve that
[1:21:53] no we shouldn't have that attitude
[1:21:57] right yeah amen I'll just amen cuz I
[1:22:00] believe that we should care for one
[1:22:02] another right so Lord give us spiritual
[1:22:04] Eyes Lord that we can see each other if
[1:22:06] we're doing well praise God you look
[1:22:08] healthy you've been eating some good
[1:22:09] healthy vegetables absolutely I've been
[1:22:11] drinking fresh water I'm not dehydrated
[1:22:14] by the salt water of the world I am hydr
[1:22:15] you know so if someone's looking well
[1:22:17] doing well spiritually praise God we
[1:22:18] should be happy for them but if they are
[1:22:21] wounded or whatever Lord how can we
[1:22:23] administer Lord let us get the first aid
[1:22:26] kit Lord because remember God heals by
[1:22:29] by love by music by Miracles by Care by
[1:22:35] understanding the prophet says he he
[1:22:38] gives comfort in many different ways but
[1:22:40] can we perceive it's Comfort coming our
[1:22:43] way see if you get wheed into a hospital
[1:22:47] you have comfort knowing that they can
[1:22:49] help you yeah right people don't go to
[1:22:52] hospitals so they don't have any comfort
[1:22:54] knowing that those people can help them
[1:22:56] right I know this is I'm probably being
[1:22:58] captain and obvious today okay probably
[1:23:00] being very obvious about but but you
[1:23:02] know you have comfort knowing they can
[1:23:04] help you amen then how much more now
[1:23:07] when we come in these doors or we or we
[1:23:09] contact one another should we not have
[1:23:11] comfort that the person I'm talking to
[1:23:14] knows the comforter they know the
[1:23:17] Supreme one amen that can bring Comfort
[1:23:19] bring healing bring peace they can they
[1:23:22] can actually bandage me up
[1:23:25] amen they can can do we not isn't that
[1:23:28] why isn't that why people put prayer
[1:23:30] requests on Amen do we not have comfort
[1:23:33] knowing god I believe you and I know you
[1:23:35] hear my prayers but I'm asking them to
[1:23:37] pray for me as well because I believe
[1:23:39] you hear their prayers so I have com see
[1:23:42] if I had no comfort in in in in knowing
[1:23:46] if I had no confidence or comfort in you
[1:23:49] that you could contact God I wouldn't
[1:23:50] ask
[1:23:51] you I mean it's that simple right I mean
[1:23:54] but because I know I have confidence in
[1:23:56] all of you and I can take comfort that
[1:23:58] that you're my brothers and sisters you
[1:24:00] love me you have care for me you can
[1:24:02] enter into my burdens and you can pray
[1:24:05] with
[1:24:06] me
[1:24:07] amen but someone who's on the road here
[1:24:11] oh no on the sidewalk they won't be able
[1:24:13] to pray with the same way because
[1:24:16] they're standing or driving or walking
[1:24:18] in the wrong
[1:24:19] place right but someone who's on the
[1:24:21] road on the King's Highway they can
[1:24:23] really pray the Right Way
[1:24:27] am amen
[1:24:29] amen praise the
[1:24:32] Lord hallelujah
[1:24:35] now this is from marriage and divorce
[1:24:37] not not that we speaking about that
[1:24:39] subject but listen to me this
[1:24:40] encapsulates the whole thing just like
[1:24:42] today there are two great schools of
[1:24:43] Doctrine in the church one of them is
[1:24:45] Calvinism the other is Armenian ISM one
[1:24:47] of them is legalist the other is Grace
[1:24:49] and we find and we come to find out that
[1:24:51] the people who believe in grace the
[1:24:52] Calvinists they say bless God it don't
[1:24:55] hurt me to smoke it don't hurt me to
[1:24:56] drink I can do these things I've got
[1:24:58] eternal security then you find out the
[1:25:00] other side on the legalist said oh I
[1:25:02] would like to ball him out I'd like to
[1:25:04] show him a piece of my mind but I'm a
[1:25:06] Christian I have to keep
[1:25:08] still so legally or By Their Own
[1:25:12] Strength they're feeling things they're
[1:25:14] thinking things but they can't say it
[1:25:16] because it's
[1:25:18] wrong outwardly they may look right but
[1:25:20] inwardly no that's worse but then
[1:25:23] actually the well he calls it Grace I'm
[1:25:25] going to call it
[1:25:26] liberal they are just as bad because
[1:25:28] both actually are selfish in their
[1:25:30] nature right just like I said the car on
[1:25:32] the sidewalk both are selfish in their
[1:25:34] nature because one says well I'll look
[1:25:36] bad if I say it and the other says I
[1:25:39] don't care what people think I'm going
[1:25:40] to do it
[1:25:42] anyway what they're driving on the
[1:25:45] sidewalk amen you find them on two
[1:25:47] different roads and neither one of them
[1:25:49] is right now it's hard to say that but
[1:25:51] it is the
[1:25:53] truth see the person
[1:25:56] who oh anyway we we find ourselves on
[1:25:58] two different roads one is going one way
[1:26:00] and one the other now let's see what the
[1:26:02] truth is now listen and see if this
[1:26:04] sounds sensible to you for instance if I
[1:26:06] get ready to go overseas I take my take
[1:26:09] my own family I'll call my wife up to me
[1:26:11] and I'll say well I'm going overseas
[1:26:13] dear now here's the legalist side now my
[1:26:15] wife I'm going to lay the law down to
[1:26:17] you if you flirt with any man while I'm
[1:26:18] gone when I come back you're a divorce
[1:26:21] woman I don't want you making eyes I
[1:26:23] don't want you flirting you understand
[1:26:24] that I'm your husband if you do it I'm
[1:26:26] going to put you away when I come back
[1:26:28] then she reaches me and gets me by the
[1:26:30] tie and say my good man I want to tell
[1:26:32] you something see see that if you make
[1:26:35] eyes at any woman or take any woman out
[1:26:37] or flirt with any woman you're going to
[1:26:38] be a divorced man when you come back now
[1:26:41] wouldn't that be a happy
[1:26:43] home oh
[1:26:46] my it's a house not a
[1:26:50] home um that's legalist all right now
[1:26:54] now the other side is now if I go
[1:26:55] overseas and I make a mistake go over
[1:26:57] and say now look I'll I'll take this
[1:26:59] woman out oh it's all right with my wife
[1:27:01] she don't care my wife say I'll go out
[1:27:03] with this man it'll be all right with
[1:27:05] Bill he don't care if I don't care then
[1:27:08] there's something wrong with me I don't
[1:27:12] love that woman right and if she don't
[1:27:14] care there is something wrong with her
[1:27:15] she's my wife I don't want other man
[1:27:18] fooling with her she is my wife now the
[1:27:21] other side that if I go over see and I
[1:27:24] make a mistake go over and say now look
[1:27:26] wait sorry have I got this the same here
[1:27:30] yeah I think it's sorry um all right she
[1:27:33] don't
[1:27:34] care I think I've got this quote
[1:27:37] wrong oh now the correct way of it is oh
[1:27:40] wait no no the other side of it is now
[1:27:42] that if I go overseas and make a mistake
[1:27:44] go over and say now look I'll take this
[1:27:46] woman out oh it's all right with my wife
[1:27:48] uh she don't care my wife says I'll go
[1:27:50] out with this man it's all right with
[1:27:51] Bill he don't care if I don't care
[1:27:53] there's something wrong with me I love
[1:27:54] that woman right and if she don't care
[1:27:56] there's something wrong with her she's
[1:27:57] my wife I don't want any man fooling
[1:27:59] with her she's my wife now the correct
[1:28:01] way of it is is that both of them has
[1:28:03] got a truth but not exact the truth the
[1:28:06] sidewalk is kind of the road but not at
[1:28:08] the same time it's right by the road
[1:28:11] it's p of the road it's all those things
[1:28:13] but it's not the road right now when I
[1:28:15] go overseas to make it right my little
[1:28:17] family gathers around and we pray one
[1:28:20] with another um um with one another and
[1:28:23] I commit them to God they commit me to
[1:28:25] God and when we do and I go overseas now
[1:28:29] I know she loves me I have confidence in
[1:28:31] her and I love her she's got confidence
[1:28:34] in me and as long as I love her like
[1:28:36] that she don't have any worry about me
[1:28:38] taking any other woman out as long as
[1:28:41] she loves me right why there is no need
[1:28:43] of me thinking about any other man going
[1:28:45] out with her because she is my wife and
[1:28:48] I believe her that's the right way see
[1:28:52] genuine love and confidence in one
[1:28:54] another right and when you have genuine
[1:28:56] love and confidence in our Lord Jesus
[1:28:58] Christ where does he where does he place
[1:29:00] you in the middle of the road you're not
[1:29:03] on the sidewalk because you are mindful
[1:29:06] that your actions affect others right
[1:29:09] you're not selfish you you are mindful
[1:29:13] you love everybody you love him and it
[1:29:15] keeps you on the road amen
[1:29:20] amen praise the Lord now
[1:29:24] let's just go here a bit we have a great
[1:29:28] comforter right and our comfort does not
[1:29:31] just lay on this side of the veil okay
[1:29:34] but our comfort really lays up yonder
[1:29:37] because remember our comfort like I read
[1:29:39] that list before about our being young
[1:29:42] uh being popular be your position your
[1:29:44] intelligence hobby entertainment part of
[1:29:46] a group all those things that's all
[1:29:47] shifting sand right but if he is truly
[1:29:50] your comforter that is a rock that
[1:29:53] cannot move right it's an eternal source
[1:29:55] of comfort amen so now our comfort
[1:29:59] doesn't just lay here in terms of him
[1:30:01] his Spirit working with us him dwelling
[1:30:03] in us but we have a great comfort
[1:30:05] knowing where we're going amen right
[1:30:07] because every other Comfort is the here
[1:30:08] and now right but our comfort is not
[1:30:11] just the here and now but it's in the
[1:30:12] future too right CU it's an eternal
[1:30:14] Comfort right amen like the Apostle Paul
[1:30:17] he had great comfort saying he knew his
[1:30:19] head was going to be cut off but he said
[1:30:21] I have a crown of life waiting for me
[1:30:23] right his comfort wasn't in anything of
[1:30:26] this Earth cuz remember he got to a
[1:30:27] place I think he wrote to Titus or
[1:30:29] Timothy Winter's coming I need my
[1:30:31] coat he was in prison he was cold he was
[1:30:35] destitute all the Comforts of life that
[1:30:37] he would have experienced being a
[1:30:39] Pharisee was gone and that wasn't
[1:30:42] because God was mad with him no God was
[1:30:44] pleased with him right but God wanted to
[1:30:47] show the Apostle Paul I am your comfort
[1:30:50] what you read David writing about
[1:30:53] Apostle Paul you're going to experience
[1:30:56] and then you can demonstrate it amen to
[1:30:58] the people you preach to because
[1:31:00] remember the gospel does not come in
[1:31:01] word only but a power and demonstration
[1:31:04] of the Holy Ghost right and that power
[1:31:06] and demonstration is not just
[1:31:07] Supernatural
[1:31:09] Miracles that's part of it but that
[1:31:11] power and demonstration is when the
[1:31:13] Apostle Paul came he said I didn't come
[1:31:15] to you with man's wise words but the
[1:31:18] power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:31:19] Ghost so what is he saying he's
[1:31:20] basically saying I haven't come to you
[1:31:22] with an intellectual understanding I've
[1:31:24] come with you re with a revelation I
[1:31:26] mean because the comfort is within me
[1:31:28] then I can impart this Revelation to you
[1:31:30] and you can walk on the same road with
[1:31:33] me so you can experience what I'm
[1:31:35] preaching about so it was an experience
[1:31:37] then it became a manifestation right I
[1:31:40] mean so the people saw what hey this guy
[1:31:42] what he's talking about it's not Theory
[1:31:45] it's a practical application right and
[1:31:49] if you can see your life cuz sometimes
[1:31:51] let's be honest let's go back to that
[1:31:55] picture we're all going to drive on the
[1:31:58] sidewalk I'm sorry but you're going to
[1:32:01] you're going to pull over you're going
[1:32:02] to drive cuz we're in these bodies it's
[1:32:06] the grace of God that brings us back
[1:32:07] onto the road thank you my Lord right
[1:32:10] but we should be shocked man I don't
[1:32:12] drive a you know all you guys who do
[1:32:14] like civil stuff and you drive trucks
[1:32:16] and big Utes and stuff there would have
[1:32:18] been a time maybe when you kind of
[1:32:19] gently went over the curb maybe but then
[1:32:23] it's like hey B you just you're just
[1:32:25] driving like you stole it you
[1:32:27] know we should never be like that in our
[1:32:29] Christian walk it should be a shock when
[1:32:31] we're on the we're on one side of the
[1:32:33] other when we actually feel ourselves in
[1:32:35] our spirit go onto the sidewalk it
[1:32:37] should be shocking where we you where
[1:32:40] once it's the love of God in your heart
[1:32:41] and you're so thankful you're saved and
[1:32:43] the next minute you're comparing
[1:32:44] yourself with others and how you dress
[1:32:47] with others and what they're doing with
[1:32:49] you what you're doing with others what's
[1:32:51] happened you've actually gone over the
[1:32:52] curb and you're on the sidewalk but when
[1:32:54] those thoughts come and you feel a cold
[1:32:56] indifference liberalism has a cold
[1:32:58] indifference too because it doesn't care
[1:33:00] about what's going on both are selfish
[1:33:02] but when that feeling comes in there
[1:33:04] should be a
[1:33:05] shock right but the thing is the longer
[1:33:08] you drive in a place the more you get
[1:33:09] used to
[1:33:10] it so we should never ever allow it to
[1:33:14] be well praise God I'm on the side I'm
[1:33:17] just m I'm just naturally more
[1:33:20] legalistic so I'm just going to this is
[1:33:23] I'm right this is just how I natur God
[1:33:24] made a variety of people this is just
[1:33:26] how I am but without the love of God if
[1:33:28] you truly have the love of God you won't
[1:33:30] stay that way or liberal well I'm just
[1:33:32] naturally just like this and this is my
[1:33:34] personality and this is you know and God
[1:33:36] his grace is so great I can do you know
[1:33:39] then you're on the side walk because I'm
[1:33:41] sure you've all experienced it when you
[1:33:43] first meet the Lord you don't want to
[1:33:44] harm him you don't want to hurt him you
[1:33:47] don't want to bring her
[1:33:49] reproach right isn't that right you
[1:33:51] don't want to you don't want to be a
[1:33:53] bill board advertising false
[1:33:57] religion you want to be a living
[1:33:59] billboard advertising Jesus saves Jesus
[1:34:01] is real his word is true this thing
[1:34:04] works amen I've tasted I've seen that
[1:34:06] the Lord is good and and that's the kind
[1:34:10] of billb we want to be but then what
[1:34:12] happens things can happen in life and
[1:34:14] because of this thing that there is
[1:34:15] going to be changed soon praise God we
[1:34:17] can end up on the
[1:34:20] sidewalk I say let him let him turn the
[1:34:23] sering we put you back on the road am
[1:34:25] Hallelujah right but the longer we go on
[1:34:28] the road the more used to it people can
[1:34:30] be I mean sorry on the sidewalk we get
[1:34:32] more used to driving there so may it
[1:34:35] always be a shock when you go over the
[1:34:38] curb right he say Lord I don't want to
[1:34:40] be driving here I don't want to hit
[1:34:41] anyone Lord I don't want to cause
[1:34:43] trouble around me because of where I'm
[1:34:45] driving where I'm walking my attitude
[1:34:47] towards others Lord put me back on the
[1:34:51] road amen
[1:34:54] praise the Lord so now so the Apostle
[1:34:56] Paul it was an experience right he said
[1:34:59] now if we did not he says for if Christ
[1:35:02] had was not raised your faith is in vain
[1:35:04] and ye are yet in your sins then we also
[1:35:07] which have fallen asleep in Christ have
[1:35:08] perished if in this life only we have
[1:35:11] hope in Christ we are all men most
[1:35:13] miserable so he's B saying if if this is
[1:35:16] all we have this is all our comfort we
[1:35:18] are the most miserable but he's
[1:35:19] basically saying we are not that way if
[1:35:21] you keep reading through no we are the
[1:35:24] most joyful most comforted people in the
[1:35:27] history of the world in
[1:35:30] 2024 you want to see people with comfort
[1:35:33] you want to see people with a stability
[1:35:35] in their life you want to see a people
[1:35:37] where their source of strength is not a
[1:35:39] hobby it's not a TV show it's not what's
[1:35:42] trending on Tik Tok no it is the Lord
[1:35:45] Jesus Christ they have a real source of
[1:35:47] comfort I'm looking at a whole bunch of
[1:35:48] them right here I mean when you really
[1:35:51] boil it down you say what is my source
[1:35:53] of comfort what is my strong tower Lord
[1:35:55] It's You amen it's your presence Lord
[1:35:57] It's Your word Lord where I can come
[1:35:59] into your presence Lord and you can
[1:36:00] bring me back on the road and I can
[1:36:02] Rejoice amen and I can let off the
[1:36:04] pressure no matter what's going on in
[1:36:06] life you say well I'm tired I'm strung
[1:36:08] out I'm worn out let off the pressure
[1:36:10] amen just let off the pressure you may
[1:36:12] be feeling tired in your body but let
[1:36:13] your spirit soar in the presence of God
[1:36:15] and give him praise this morning amen
[1:36:17] why because we have we have a comfort
[1:36:20] that cannot be taken from us amen the
[1:36:23] OST Paul and and and I'm just going to
[1:36:25] close with this scripture what shall we
[1:36:27] say then to these things if God be for
[1:36:29] us who can be against us so basically if
[1:36:31] God before me who can take him away from
[1:36:33] me who can who can separate me from my
[1:36:35] comfort he that spared not his own son
[1:36:37] but delivered him up for us all how
[1:36:40] shall uh he not with him also freely uh
[1:36:43] give us all things who shall lay
[1:36:45] anything to the charge of God's elect it
[1:36:47] is God that justifieth amen who is he
[1:36:51] that condemneth it is Christ that died y
[1:36:53] rather that is risen again who is even
[1:36:56] at the right hand of God who maketh
[1:36:57] intercession for us who shall separate
[1:36:59] us from the love of Christ shall
[1:37:01] tribulation or distress or persecution
[1:37:03] or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword
[1:37:06] as is is written for thy sakes we are
[1:37:08] killed all the day long we are accounted
[1:37:10] as sheep for the slaughter nay in all
[1:37:12] these things we are more than conquerors
[1:37:14] through him that loved us I am persuaded
[1:37:16] that neither death nor life nor angels
[1:37:18] nor principalities nor powers nor things
[1:37:20] present nor things to come nor height
[1:37:22] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:37:24] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:37:26] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so
[1:37:29] the Apostle Paul was fully persuaded
[1:37:31] nothing could separate him from his
[1:37:33] comforter nothing could take him from
[1:37:35] his source of comfort and source of
[1:37:36] strength nothing could separate him amen
[1:37:38] and that's why he could let off the
[1:37:39] pressure that's why he could praise God
[1:37:41] in every situation because his comfort
[1:37:44] wasn't based on his location you take us
[1:37:48] we so we're a capital city you take the
[1:37:51] capital city of the Ukraine people
[1:37:53] living on the same planet in two
[1:37:55] different locations some people are
[1:37:57] comforted that we live on the back end
[1:37:59] of the Pacific and others are not
[1:38:01] comforted because the Russians are at
[1:38:02] the
[1:38:03] door their comfort is based on if
[1:38:05] they're not a believer that is their
[1:38:08] location but the believer their comfort
[1:38:11] is based on their location there in
[1:38:13] Christ am you see amen so how about you
[1:38:16] and I friends is he your source of
[1:38:18] comfort amen everything else will be
[1:38:20] gone it won't be a lasting Comfort but
[1:38:22] let me tell you he since 2007 he's my
[1:38:25] source of comfort he's my strong tower
[1:38:28] he's my refuge he's everything I have
[1:38:30] need of is him when I when pressure
[1:38:33] builds up I realize one thing Lord I'm
[1:38:34] sorry I haven't gone to your presence
[1:38:36] let off the pressure if I feel
[1:38:38] discomforted in myself I say Lord I'm
[1:38:40] sorry I'm not drawing strength from you
[1:38:41] my
[1:38:42] comfort amen and when you do that it
[1:38:45] pays off it's the greatest place to be
[1:38:49] and he goes with you wherever you go Hal
[1:38:53] hallelujah amen so friends I trust you

[1:39:32] about this person what about this what
[1:39:34] about this he's lying cuz he's not

[1:45:18] word of prayer you say Lord let's just
[1:45:20] bow our heads I want to ask you a
[1:45:21] question are you on the sidewalk today
[1:45:23] are you on the road is your life
[1:45:26] impacting people negatively there's a
[1:45:28] resentment that comes out of you and
[1:45:29] you're just bothering people and just
[1:45:31] your attitudes and things or is it
[1:45:33] genuine love that comes out of you to
[1:45:36] others is there a genuine care and
[1:45:38] consideration that no matter where
[1:45:39] others may be driving they may be on the
[1:45:41] sidewalk they may be in the ditch they
[1:45:43] may be on fire on the side of the road
[1:45:44] but you have a love for them and a care
