[8:30] good morning friends welcome to the
[8:33] house of the Lord
[8:35] um I really would like to invite our
[8:37] brother ampo to pray and to pray also
[8:41] for our sister Priscilla
[8:43] that I read that she wasn't she wasn't
[8:46] that well
[8:48] I know that we're gonna have a mighty
[8:50] service in the Lord
[8:52] every time when I when I walk here and I
[8:55] can see all of you sitting here it's
[8:56] like the people waiting in the ferry or
[8:59] like in the plane just waiting for that
[9:01] moment to the captain to start the
[9:03] engine and and to move
[9:06] okay
[9:08] [Music]
[9:16] our heavenly father Lord Jesus Christ
[9:19] God of Mercy as we stand before you
[9:23] we think of a scripture in the Bible
[9:25] father that says in Amos chapter 3 it
[9:28] says Lord surely the Lord God will use
[9:31] the prophets to speak and if the Lord
[9:34] speak this morning
[9:36] who shall not but prophesy
[9:38] Lord if the lion roar this morning who
[9:41] cannot be scared
[9:44] and Lord the lion of the tribe of Judah
[9:46] is roaring this morning and we want to
[9:48] respond further this morning this
[9:51] morning we want to stand in your
[9:52] presence and say father surely goodness
[9:56] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[9:58] of our lives and father God we want to
[10:01] speak in the spirit of of that scripture
[10:03] of Amos chapter 3 Lord when it says how
[10:06] can two work together unless they agree
[10:09] this morning that's why father we want
[10:11] to come in agreement with your weight
[10:14] this morning you want father to put
[10:16] everything aside for real
[10:19] that Lord you can erase and eradicate
[10:23] every thought that will come in the
[10:26] presence of God like the devil did come
[10:28] in the presence of God this morning we
[10:31] want to show him out and show him the
[10:33] door let there be only pure thoughts in
[10:36] the presence of God in this house of God
[10:38] this morning in this body flesh House of
[10:42] God this morning is our prayer Lord Holy
[10:46] Father as we stand here we say Lord let
[10:48] you be praised only you father let our
[10:51] focus our minds our attitudes be
[10:54] directed only to you and that is the
[10:57] purpose why we are here this morning no
[11:00] other purpose no other reasoning no
[11:03] other Gathering father we don't want to
[11:06] come in the spirit of a church or a
[11:08] denomination
[11:10] we ask Lord that you individualize our
[11:12] visit this morning amen that is let it
[11:15] be special let let us not forget that on
[11:19] the Sunday morning
[11:20] on that day in 2023 God changed my life
[11:25] for good
[11:26] and Lord I pray that you forgive our
[11:28] sins our iniquity for we know Lord that
[11:31] we die daily
[11:33] do mistakes we do stupid things
[11:35] sometimes and I pray Lord that if
[11:38] there's anything against your word in
[11:40] our hearts
[11:41] remove it Lord clear the way father that
[11:44] Lord there will be no no no hold on by
[11:47] the devil this morning disturbing the
[11:50] flow of your weight Lord we want your
[11:52] pure
[11:53] unadulated word of God pure father to
[11:57] come in and come and saturate us Lord

[12:26] up his hands Lord this morning we say
[12:28] let no weakness of our brother let none

[45:55] way we'll see nothing when I get to the
[45:57] end of the road so I'm I'm I really
[46:00] enjoyed those and
[46:02] um this is a a I often come up here and
[46:05] tell you oh I'm not going to tell you
[46:07] something that you haven't heard before
[46:08] you hear me say that and you people
[46:11] don't believe me when I say that but
[46:12] that's the truth and you and I come to
[46:14] say it and you're like yeah we knew all
[46:16] that
[46:17] you just sometimes when you put
[46:19] something everyone knows in a way that
[46:20] it just puts it all together
[46:22] then they it's like oh well I never saw
[46:25] that but you knew it all already
[46:27] um that's not going to be quite like
[46:28] that with this one this one's a a wee
[46:31] bit more complicated
[46:33] um any and for me it's been a bit
[46:35] complicated and it's been a thought
[46:36] that's been on my mind for about four
[46:38] months
[46:39] constantly I've been
[46:41] thinking about this thing and it's but
[46:43] before that it's been something I've
[46:45] been thinking about for about 20 years
[46:48] and I've put pieces together over 20
[46:50] years of this particular saw and this is
[46:53] the furthest that I've got with it
[46:55] over the the time so it's a challenging
[46:58] thought for me to deliver now I'm just
[47:01] speaking to you as a as a man
[47:03] their brother this morning
[47:06] um
[47:07] just in my frailties and weaknesses and
[47:09] things like that that we are as a human
[47:12] that that's how I'm speaking to you now
[47:13] just in just to kind of catch your
[47:17] spirit and get to know people a bit and
[47:19] get settled in but
[47:20] when I start speaking I'm not going to
[47:22] speak like that I'm going to speak as
[47:23] though it's from the Lord
[47:26] and
[47:28] I'm going to sound convincing because I
[47:30] believe what I'm talking about
[47:32] but
[47:33] it's because I've looked right into a
[47:34] lot of stuff and I I happen to believe
[47:36] this so I'm going to speak it as though
[47:38] I believe it
[47:39] but now speaking to you as a brother
[47:42] I want you to know it's in Fellowship
[47:43] that that I'm talking now because it's
[47:45] Brethren that I know
[47:46] I can't get up here and speak from the
[47:48] word of God and not believe what I'm
[47:49] talking about so I've got to deliver it
[47:51] in a way that I know what I'm talking
[47:52] about but that doesn't mean you have to
[47:54] say it all the way that I see it when I
[47:55] might sound like
[47:57] I'm convincing and that you have to you
[47:59] think well I must believe him because he
[48:00] really sounds like he knows what he's
[48:01] talking about
[48:03] okay you understand that little concept
[48:05] okay I just want to lay that because I'm
[48:07] going to go pretty fast through this as
[48:09] well you're right with it
[48:11] because it's a long thought and and I
[48:13] have to deliver it in one segment
[48:15] because you need to capture I want to
[48:17] capture the whole thought of this whole
[48:18] thing so I've gotta I can't really break
[48:20] it up into two because you will miss the
[48:23] the Journey of it we've got to go from
[48:26] the beginning to the end
[48:28] okay
[48:30] and I mean brother Ben said you can
[48:32] carry on some other foam and you know
[48:33] you can unfold it but I don't want to do
[48:35] that I just want to deliver it so this
[48:37] is four months trying to compress it
[48:38] into about an hour and 15 minutes
[48:41] okay so so um when we go we're gonna go
[48:44] and I'm gonna I'm gonna talk for like uh
[48:46] that's from the Lord not not
[48:49] okay now there's some things that have
[48:50] been hard for me to perceive in this and
[48:52] get my head around
[48:54] but I believe that the purpose of this
[48:56] is to bless you and to help you to
[48:58] understand who you are
[49:00] and now brother Brandon says when we
[49:03] know who we are then the Rapture will go
[49:07] um now in order to find out who we are
[49:09] I've also got to find out who was
[49:11] everyone else how does this whole thing
[49:12] work because because when you see that
[49:14] everything else has to have its place as
[49:15] well so Humanity everything has to have
[49:17] its place and that and I've endeavored
[49:20] to look into it all and figure out where
[49:22] does everything fit in this whole thing
[49:24] yeah and it's often talking about
[49:26] spiritual things that we can't see that
[49:27] we wouldn't perceive if we just walked
[49:29] around although we can see the effects
[49:31] of it but I'm talking about spiritual
[49:33] things this morning
[49:34] okay I'm gonna start now
[49:36] okay
[49:38] so I read the scripture here and quite
[49:40] often when I do I read I've got another
[49:43] um I've got a Bible app that shows a
[49:44] whole bunch of different versions then
[49:46] it shows the the Greek or the Hebrew as
[49:48] well so I like to look into to get the
[49:50] essence of sometimes what it's talking
[49:51] about to see if there's English
[49:53] translations that I've missed now the
[49:55] different ones were similar on the last
[49:58] line in particular that I was interested
[50:00] in I said because when we are closed we
[50:01] will not be found naked they all go down
[50:03] we will not be found naked but the
[50:04] another translation put it we will not
[50:06] be found Spirits without bodies and that
[50:08] intrigues me I thought it's possible to
[50:10] have a spirit without a body that's
[50:12] intriguing that was an intriguing
[50:13] thought so that's where this thought
[50:14] started to come from
[50:15] who who would there be that would have a
[50:17] spirit without a body now you're going
[50:20] to see this picture here a lot or this
[50:21] idea a lot of three because God always
[50:23] works in threes when you want to find
[50:26] out the truth of something you've got to
[50:27] find find three things find how it's one
[50:29] two three and you'll be getting
[50:31] something if you end up with two or four
[50:32] or five you've kind of gone off the
[50:34] track somewhere
[50:35] most of the principles of God have got
[50:37] to work in three three is his Perfection
[50:39] okay and I'm going to be talking in
[50:42] these different Realms one one realm
[50:45] we've got no time I'm going to call that
[50:46] no time one realm that we are in as time
[50:49] as we know and one realm is eternity Now
[50:50] by no time I mean slow down so time has
[50:52] stopped like anyone you're having a bad
[50:54] day
[50:54] and you think man it's like a dragged on
[50:56] forever
[50:57] I believe there's a realm where that bad
[50:58] day is almost it's in time but it's like
[51:00] it's stopped the time just
[51:03] things don't improve I believe that's
[51:05] hell in that realm right this realm it
[51:07] goes 24 hours in a day it ticks over
[51:09] like it does there's an eternal realm
[51:11] that is not like this so we've got to
[51:12] get our mind off of just this natural
[51:14] thing when we describe these thoughts
[51:15] this is um Albert Einstein smart people
[51:18] always seem to be able to say
[51:18] complicated things in a simple way and
[51:21] he's talking about relativity I want to
[51:22] just get our minds just thinking a
[51:23] little bit different for a moment here
[51:25] you see relativity is
[51:28] when you're quoting a nice girl an hour
[51:29] seems like a second Ben would say Amen
[51:33] and when you sit on a red hot Cinder
[51:36] or a red hot braai
[51:38] a second seems like an hour
[51:40] you know that's relativity depends what
[51:42] it's relative to what your situation is
[51:44] relative to right so now the theory of
[51:46] relativity
[51:48] is that things are relative to other
[51:51] things so in this picture here you've
[51:52] got a if a if a person is there and they
[51:55] fire an arrow and their Arrow travels
[51:56] 200 kilometers an hour then relative to
[51:57] them the area is 200 kilometers an hour
[51:59] but if someone is on a train that's
[52:00] traveling at 100 kilometers an hour and
[52:02] they shoot the arrow the arrow is in
[52:05] relation to him now is traveling 100
[52:06] kilometers an hour because he's
[52:07] traveling at 100 kilometers so it's it's
[52:10] even though it's 200 to him it's 100 and
[52:12] if there was an object coming the other
[52:13] way to the arrow or the train at 200
[52:15] kilometers an hour then relative to each
[52:17] other it's 400 kilometers an hour this
[52:19] is what relativity means right
[52:20] everything is relative relative to
[52:22] everything else and that's how we can
[52:23] work out a whole lot of things relative
[52:24] right
[52:26] until you get to this concept called
[52:27] light and it does its own thing that's
[52:29] right it light itself light just stays
[52:32] the same it doesn't matter what anything
[52:33] else is doing light always stays the
[52:35] same whether you're traveling towards it
[52:36] at the same speed as it it's going at
[52:37] the set speed if it's traveling away
[52:39] from you and you're traveling the
[52:41] opposite direction it's going the same
[52:42] speed
[52:43] it doesn't matter what happens light
[52:44] always travels the same speed doesn't
[52:45] matter what's relative around it right
[52:47] and it travels really fast the speed of
[52:51] light is about 300 uh 299 792
[52:56] 458 meters a second or three at this but
[52:58] just put it this way 300 000 kilometers
[53:00] a second about how fast it travels so if
[53:02] you were standing on the equator
[53:04] and uh the light had to travel from you
[53:07] and come back around to you and you said
[53:09] on your marks get sick go before you
[53:11] said the word g it would have gone
[53:13] around about three times when you finish
[53:15] your word go it's gone around about
[53:17] seven or eight times when you finish go
[53:19] so so that's how fast
[53:22] uh light travels right so
[53:24] because of this concept that that it
[53:26] never uh everything else changes around
[53:29] it Einstein thought well if that's the
[53:31] case then other things have to bend to
[53:33] make this travel like that so he
[53:35] understood that if the faster you travel
[53:38] your time as you know it slows down it
[53:41] just has to be that way because it time
[53:43] has to bend in line with this constant
[53:45] yes right so if you go faster your world
[53:48] is going to change time uh light's going
[53:49] to stay the same right so and these guys
[53:51] tried it when they they got three atomic
[53:53] clocks one and one playing one another
[53:54] plane and one on the earth they flew one
[53:57] plane one way around the earth one the
[53:58] other way one plane went with the with
[54:01] the turn of the earth and one went away
[54:02] with it and when they landed the planes
[54:05] back down with the clock relative to the
[54:07] on the earth the time on the these
[54:09] atomic clocks were different that tells
[54:11] them okay something's going on here time
[54:13] is changing that time a different amount
[54:15] of time passed when it was traveling
[54:16] faster than this one on on the Earth
[54:18] right so that's when they understood
[54:20] that that this is God declaring himself
[54:22] if you travel at the speed of light time
[54:24] will stop right that's that's a that's a
[54:26] fact like when they work out that okay
[54:28] that's what happens
[54:30] um if you travel at the speed of light
[54:31] you need all the energy to do it if you
[54:34] travel at the speed of light your mess
[54:35] will fill everything you'll become
[54:37] everything
[54:37] so
[54:40] I don't brother brand upstairs I don't
[54:43] care where the person is it might be
[54:44] across the sea across the ocean no
[54:45] matter where it is God covers all space
[54:47] fills all the time he's omnipot he's
[54:49] omnipotent he's omnipresent he's
[54:51] infinite right because he's he's in a
[54:54] different realm he's in that that realm
[54:55] where he's everything right
[54:57] I want to tie it back to just how he is
[54:59] and in first John 1 5 it says this then
[55:01] is the message which we have heard of
[55:03] him and to clear unto you that God is
[55:04] light and then him has no Darkness at
[55:05] all
[55:07] because he fills all the time and space
[55:08] he just fills everything
[55:10] and the speed of light which is a
[55:11] constant and is the same speed
[55:12] regardless of your perspective doesn't
[55:14] the word of God say I'm God no change or
[55:16] not or him as the nurse will pass away
[55:18] but my words shall not pass away and God
[55:19] is his word because it's an expression
[55:21] of him everything else see time and
[55:23] space Bend relative to to
[55:27] like if you travel faster even space is
[55:30] going to warp itself to make you keep
[55:32] going to make light keep traveling the
[55:33] same speed
[55:34] okay so so now I think outside a little
[55:36] bit about that this is just all happens
[55:38] normally nothing happens normally around
[55:40] here
[55:42] and job says where is the way to the
[55:44] dwelling of light and darkness where is
[55:46] its place
[55:47] these places have a place where they
[55:49] dwell
[55:50] if there's a place we like dwells how
[55:51] fast is that and where I'm going what's
[55:52] happening up there there's something
[55:53] else going on Daniel said he reveals the
[55:55] deep and secret things he knoweth what
[55:57] is in the darkness and the light
[55:58] dwelleth with him
[56:00] the light rests stops
[56:03] that realm must be going pretty fast all
[56:05] right
[56:05] so that's why I go back to this one
[56:08] there's there's Realms where things are
[56:09] just different than what this one is I
[56:11] believe this realm has just been slowed
[56:12] down that light and darkness can exist
[56:15] in this realm too that we can perceive
[56:17] it right but when you get to this other
[56:19] realm what we would know here is
[56:20] Darkness because there is kind of a
[56:21] Darkness there but I don't believe it's
[56:23] not a Darkness like this Darkness
[56:25] because there is light and day in the
[56:27] new Heavens new Earth for some people
[56:30] but
[56:31] hello bro how are you good to see you
[56:35] first John 1 5 says this is then the
[56:38] message which we have heard of Amanda
[56:39] clear unto you that God is light and
[56:41] then there's no Darkness at all and then
[56:43] I found it interesting that John 1 5 the
[56:45] other John 1 5. so first John 1 5 says
[56:48] that and then John 1 5 says and the
[56:49] light shineth in the darkness and the
[56:51] Darkness comprehendeth it not
[56:52] this realm here that's going so slow
[56:54] it's like it's like radio waves we our
[56:56] minds can't we can't actually pick up
[56:58] that it's going on I believe there's a
[56:59] place of Darkness where light when it it
[57:01] can't even that's so slow it doesn't
[57:03] even register that there was light there
[57:05] it shot in there and that's why it's
[57:06] just pitch black this Darkness because
[57:07] light doesn't even reach in that realm
[57:10] all right this is just Isaac's idea on
[57:12] it okay the Lord will show us all the
[57:14] answers when we get to sit down and talk
[57:15] about it okay but that was just to paint
[57:17] a picture of this
[57:18] idea now I want to then in this with
[57:22] this idea talk about God this this in
[57:23] the beginning was God God filled all
[57:25] time and space and he dwelt in this
[57:27] place where it was just him alone with
[57:29] his thoughts and he was he was
[57:30] everything okay
[57:32] now
[57:34] then he from this from this thing came
[57:37] out what we call the logos or or
[57:40] at one point we then called it the Son
[57:42] of God but it was this image that came
[57:44] out from this
[57:45] eternal
[57:46] all filling being right yeah God who on
[57:49] Sunday at times and diverse men have
[57:51] spoken time past unto the fathers by the
[57:53] prophet Seth and these last days spoken
[57:54] us done to us by a son whom he hath
[57:56] appointed ear of All Things by whom also
[57:58] he made the world who being the
[58:00] brightness of his glory
[58:01] and the express Express image of his
[58:05] person and upholding All Things by the
[58:06] word of his power when he had by himself
[58:09] purged our sins sat down on the right
[58:10] hand of the Majesty on high
[58:12] it says by whom he also made the world
[58:14] so this being that came out made the
[58:15] world right okay and to make all men see
[58:19] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[58:21] which hath been
[58:22] which from the beginning of the world
[58:24] has been hit in God who created All
[58:25] Things by Jesus Christ right so this
[58:27] being that came out and was the express
[58:29] image of God had a name and it was Jesus
[58:31] that was who this who this person was
[58:33] and that's who made the world back in
[58:35] before he came as a as a son and a body
[58:38] we knew him as a father oh this is
[58:40] Father father but his name was still
[58:42] Jesus because because he was he was the
[58:44] Everlasting father he called himself
[58:45] right he was there and then when he came
[58:48] down and took on flesh not from this bit
[58:50] of dirt here but he made a new he made a
[58:53] new body and that's very important as we
[58:54] get it to a later on it wasn't from here
[58:55] it was a new body but when he displayed
[58:57] himself in this body then we called that
[58:59] the son or his son and he came as the
[59:01] son of man but it was that same being
[59:03] that made the world and then when he
[59:04] when he left and sent his Spirit back it
[59:06] was that same spirit that encompassed
[59:08] the whole thing that comes back into us
[59:09] which still has a name as Jesus right so
[59:12] that's why we baptized the name of the
[59:13] Lord Jesus Christ it's the same being
[59:15] okay now when this image came out of God
[59:17] it had a shape it wasn't just a blob
[59:20] that came out now we might call it the
[59:21] pillar of fire but it actually had a
[59:23] shape and it looked like this because
[59:25] when he when he went down and talked to
[59:27] Moses he said and the Lord said behold
[59:29] there is a place by me and thou shalt
[59:31] stand upon the rock and I shall come to
[59:33] pass when my glory passeth thee I'll put
[59:35] you in the in the Cliff of The Rock and
[59:37] I'll cover thee with my hand while I
[59:38] pass by
[59:40] and I will take away my hand and thou
[59:43] shalt see my back Parts but my face Thou
[59:45] shalt not see so he said he's got a hand
[59:47] he's got a back and he's got a face
[59:49] he looks like us right and then he said
[59:51] I'll McMahon in my own image now I've
[59:54] tried to get as many scriptures as I can
[59:55] through this and and quotes from Brother
[59:57] Brenner who I believe and he's gotten
[1:00:00] his uh his Doctrine from all of the
[1:00:02] prophets and everyone throughout the
[1:00:03] ages so I'm not just going to throw
[1:00:04] information at you without
[1:00:06] get showing you this is why I think it's
[1:00:08] shaped like a man okay so just because
[1:00:10] if you're not sure about it you know
[1:00:12] that I'm not just speaking this okay now
[1:00:13] we've got this scripture here Job 38
[1:00:16] which starts to make things interesting
[1:00:17] because the Lord said to Joe where was
[1:00:19] there when I laid the foundations of the
[1:00:21] Earth
[1:00:24] it's hard not to preach I've got to go
[1:00:26] fast to get through this declare if thou
[1:00:28] Hast understanding
[1:00:30] who has laid the meters here off if
[1:00:32] they're noticed who has stretched the
[1:00:33] line upon it whereupon are the
[1:00:34] foundations thereof fastened or who laid
[1:00:36] the Cornerstone thereof
[1:00:38] when the morning Stars sang together and
[1:00:40] all the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:00:42] so we read this and we think okay there
[1:00:44] was a time where there were sons of God
[1:00:46] somewhere shouting for Joy when the
[1:00:47] Earth was being made
[1:00:49] now there are other translations that
[1:00:50] always change that to mean Angels but
[1:00:52] I've looked into it that doesn't say
[1:00:53] angel they only say it says Angel
[1:00:56] because they can't comprehend we weren't
[1:00:57] there
[1:00:58] but this clearly says God says where
[1:01:00] were you when I laid the foundations of
[1:01:01] the earth and when the sons of God all
[1:01:03] shouted so it's given us a bit of a a
[1:01:06] difference now there was we were there
[1:01:08] somewhere what's going on here I want to
[1:01:10] ask you who is who is this job 27 38
[1:01:13] when he said where was you when I laid
[1:01:15] the foundations of the Earth when the
[1:01:16] morning Stars sang together and the sons
[1:01:18] of God shouted for Joy who were those
[1:01:20] sons of God that were shouting for Joy
[1:01:21] Jesus told them that I had Joy with you
[1:01:24] before the foundation of the world we're
[1:01:25] not creatures of time we're creatures of
[1:01:27] Eternity so we came from we came from
[1:01:29] there okay we're not we're not from here
[1:01:32] notice he is in me and I and him notice
[1:01:35] in every Christian that's a real genuine
[1:01:37] Christian
[1:01:38] amen was with him when the morning
[1:01:40] started staying together and the sons of
[1:01:42] God shouted for Joy before there was a
[1:01:44] foundation of the world we were
[1:01:45] identified in the immortal Realms of God
[1:01:48] 10 million years before the world was
[1:01:50] ever formed I was I was back there with
[1:01:52] him
[1:01:53] if I've got eternal life I was there
[1:01:55] with him I was identified with them when
[1:01:57] the sons of God when the morning started
[1:01:58] saying together and the sons of God
[1:02:00] shouted for Joy okay
[1:02:03] you were all there I want to show you
[1:02:05] let's have a look at where we were now
[1:02:06] creation I want to talk about about
[1:02:08] creation to start to unfold this we
[1:02:11] there aren't any scriptures on this as
[1:02:13] such but brother Branham has said that
[1:02:15] the first thing God created after he
[1:02:17] became this logos were the angels to
[1:02:19] then become a God because you can't be a
[1:02:21] god unless people worship you or there
[1:02:23] has to be a relationship somehow to uh
[1:02:25] it might be uh if you're if you want to
[1:02:27] be a boss you can't have a boss with
[1:02:29] that people to work for your vice versa
[1:02:30] there's all these he he had no
[1:02:31] relationships when he was by himself so
[1:02:33] he had to start forming these things so
[1:02:35] in my opinion the first thing they made
[1:02:36] was angels and then they worshiped him
[1:02:38] and that made him God and he started
[1:02:40] from there as in previous messages I've
[1:02:42] tried to explain break it down and now
[1:02:44] when the Angels begin to worship him
[1:02:45] that was before there was even a
[1:02:47] molecule on the earth okay so we get
[1:02:48] this image okay there was God then there
[1:02:50] were these angels that he created
[1:02:52] all right okay
[1:02:54] so God created man later on it says then
[1:02:57] God create a man in his own image male
[1:02:59] and female created he then okay after
[1:03:02] this we'll get to the Earth soon but
[1:03:04] after this brother Brown says then when
[1:03:06] he said let us make man after our own
[1:03:08] image what kind of man did he make a
[1:03:10] spirit man so that man that he made
[1:03:12] there
[1:03:13] and in that instance was it was the same
[1:03:15] after his own image that that logos that
[1:03:17] came out that expressed like that walked
[1:03:19] Pastor put his hand on the rock
[1:03:21] he made a man like that yeah and his own
[1:03:24] image because that was his image so so
[1:03:25] that when he made this one that's what
[1:03:27] he made right now we're going to go to
[1:03:30] Genesis I'm gonna
[1:03:31] look at this from a different
[1:03:32] perspective for a while so we look in
[1:03:34] the in the in the account of the
[1:03:36] creation of of the world
[1:03:38] day one it says he made the the um
[1:03:41] the Earth was without form then day two
[1:03:44] he made the firmament this is a little
[1:03:46] bit hard to read here but then day three
[1:03:48] it says he made the the grass and the
[1:03:50] trees and all those sorts of things they
[1:03:51] formulate the Sun and the Moon before
[1:03:54] the plants
[1:03:55] I couldn't photo synthesize
[1:03:57] okay day five day five you made all the
[1:04:01] animals you made the fish in the sea day
[1:04:02] six he made all the the the beasts of
[1:04:04] the field those things and then after
[1:04:06] that he made Manning right at the very
[1:04:07] end he made man
[1:04:09] a spirit man and then then on the
[1:04:11] seventh day he rested right
[1:04:13] when you carry on reading it's like
[1:04:14] there's another account of creation
[1:04:16] because in it straight after that it
[1:04:17] goes now to Genesis 2 with 49 we've just
[1:04:20] gone Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 down to
[1:04:21] verse 8 uh verse three then we go to
[1:04:24] four to nine and it says these are the
[1:04:25] generations of the Earth of the heavens
[1:04:27] and the earth when they were created and
[1:04:29] the day that the Lord God made the earth
[1:04:30] and the heavens and every plant of the
[1:04:33] field before it was in the earth and
[1:04:34] every herb of the field before it grew
[1:04:36] for the Lord God had not caused it to
[1:04:38] rain upon the Earth and there was not a
[1:04:40] man to till the ground but they went up
[1:04:42] a mist from the earth and watered the
[1:04:43] whole face of the ground
[1:04:45] now if I go to these other versions here
[1:04:47] because we say this is these are the
[1:04:48] generations that the way it would be
[1:04:50] described as um this is the account of
[1:04:52] the heavens and the Earth or this is the
[1:04:54] history of the heavens and the Earth
[1:04:55] being made right so we're talking and
[1:04:58] he's clearly talking about the search
[1:04:59] because there was these things and and
[1:05:01] he's essentially saying there was dirt
[1:05:02] there was dirt there I didn't there was
[1:05:04] a Mist that came and there was dirt
[1:05:05] there were no trees nothing like that
[1:05:06] yet
[1:05:07] then then verse seven straight after
[1:05:09] that it says and the Lord God for man of
[1:05:11] the Dust of the earth so he said it took
[1:05:12] some of that dust and made man
[1:05:14] okay now there were still no trees and
[1:05:15] no birds no no animals right he Foreman
[1:05:18] of the Dust of the earth and breathed
[1:05:19] into his nostrils the Breath of Life a
[1:05:21] Man became a living soul and the Lord
[1:05:22] God planted a garden and Eastward and
[1:05:24] there he put the man whom he had formed
[1:05:26] and out of the ground
[1:05:27] made the Lord God to gravy tree that is
[1:05:29] Pleasant to the sight and good for food
[1:05:30] so it says once he made man and then he
[1:05:32] made the trees come out of the ground
[1:05:34] and the tree also tree of life also in
[1:05:36] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[1:05:37] the knowledge of Good and Evil then
[1:05:38] after that once the trees were there he
[1:05:40] said it's not good for man to be alone
[1:05:42] he said I will make him and help me for
[1:05:44] a minute says out of the ground the Lord
[1:05:46] God formed every beast of the field and
[1:05:47] if you fellow of the air so make sure
[1:05:49] those out of the ground okay and brought
[1:05:51] them on to Adam to see what he would
[1:05:53] call them whatsoever Adam called every
[1:05:54] living creature that was the name
[1:05:56] thereof okay and then it says and Adam
[1:05:58] gave names to all the cattle and the
[1:06:00] fowl of the end to every beast of the
[1:06:01] field but for Adam there was not fearing
[1:06:02] any help meat for him so we hadn't seen
[1:06:04] these animals before they arrived at him
[1:06:06] okay and then he gave them names so now
[1:06:09] it seems like it may be quite like it
[1:06:11] contradicts because in the first account
[1:06:13] it says on day three there were trees
[1:06:14] and on day six there were animals then
[1:06:16] man came right at the very end and then
[1:06:18] got arrested then on the second account
[1:06:20] it says there were no trees then he made
[1:06:22] man and then after he made man then he
[1:06:24] made the trees to grow then he made all
[1:06:27] the animals from the dirt and showed
[1:06:29] them right there seems to be a
[1:06:30] contradiction
[1:06:31] but I don't think there is you see when
[1:06:33] the sons of God shouted for Joy when
[1:06:35] they were made this is what I believe
[1:06:37] this first account of creation Genesis 1
[1:06:38] to about enter 2 to about verse 3 was
[1:06:41] actually god making the new heavens and
[1:06:42] the new Earth which is where we're going
[1:06:43] to dwell right you read it the only
[1:06:46] thing different are the Seas but they're
[1:06:48] still going to be C in the new Heaven
[1:06:49] and there's just not 70 water like what
[1:06:50] we have now but that was because the
[1:06:52] firm room broke water went all over the
[1:06:53] Earth it's the only thing that differs
[1:06:55] but when you think about it he if I come
[1:06:58] here and we go way back to the Book of
[1:07:01] Revelation we can see that there's a new
[1:07:02] Heaven and a new Earth because the first
[1:07:04] ones passed away yeah okay now
[1:07:07] this one was made after that one and
[1:07:09] there has to be an account of that one
[1:07:11] being made now that could be a dual
[1:07:12] prophecy you know we could we'd say out
[1:07:14] of each I'll call my son right they they
[1:07:17] you could now that that was meaning
[1:07:19] Egypt coming out uh that children of
[1:07:21] Israel coming out but it also meant
[1:07:22] Jesus coming up right so even though we
[1:07:25] could say oh that's Genesis one that's
[1:07:27] how God made this Earth it's like no no
[1:07:28] no that's how he made that Earth and
[1:07:30] that's where I was made when he made man
[1:07:31] I was made there he made the youth later
[1:07:33] on that's why I could say well he's
[1:07:35] making something there and I shout it
[1:07:36] for Joy right
[1:07:38] because of this think about a replica
[1:07:40] idea brother Ram says every time I see a
[1:07:42] tree I think that tree is a negative
[1:07:44] there is a positive somewhere
[1:07:45] that tree was made off of something and
[1:07:47] intelligence made it and all this Earth
[1:07:49] does is reflect the Heavenly the Bible
[1:07:51] said so and if there is a tree here that
[1:07:53] disappears there's got to be one that
[1:07:54] won't appear so saying before there was
[1:07:56] a tree mate here there had to be a tree
[1:07:57] made somewhere to patent it off right
[1:08:00] before there was a a horse there had to
[1:08:02] be a horse somewhere to patent it off
[1:08:03] before there was anything here so the
[1:08:06] first account it may seem like a differs
[1:08:07] but I believe it's making the making the
[1:08:10] yeah the real world the new Heavens
[1:08:13] newathon that we go to was made first
[1:08:16] and then he made us there as Spirit
[1:08:17] beings there we were there right
[1:08:19] then this world was made second as a
[1:08:21] replica off of that because they had to
[1:08:23] have a plan this is just this is now
[1:08:25] there's two differences when he made the
[1:08:27] two right the the first one when he made
[1:08:29] Manny said to man be fruitful and
[1:08:31] multiply
[1:08:32] that's what he said when he made the
[1:08:34] spirit man be fruitful and multiply when
[1:08:36] he made man here he said
[1:08:38] don't multiply
[1:08:39] don't touch it the tree that's in the
[1:08:42] midst of the garden metaphorical mids he
[1:08:43] said man and woman shouldn't be together
[1:08:45] the day you do that day you'll die so he
[1:08:48] said you do not multiply but this one
[1:08:49] you multiply now I'm not saying that the
[1:08:51] spirit men and women multiplied in that
[1:08:53] sense but he blessed them to multiply
[1:08:55] what happened there was all of his
[1:08:56] children he began to make his family
[1:08:58] his family that that we're going to be
[1:09:00] with him forever were made there they
[1:09:02] begin to multiply everyone every every
[1:09:05] bride of Christ that's ever going to be
[1:09:07] at the end was made there yeah was made
[1:09:09] there that's why that's why the Bible
[1:09:10] says we have a body weight in because
[1:09:12] it's death it was made before it was
[1:09:14] here this whole thing was made there
[1:09:15] first
[1:09:16] now if I can just look back over there
[1:09:19] for a bit at the beginning I could say
[1:09:20] um
[1:09:21] now what was there if we look at that
[1:09:23] new then you have the new Earth but it
[1:09:24] was the first one it was but it was the
[1:09:26] best one there was just the new Heaven
[1:09:28] and new earth and then there was you and
[1:09:30] me now there was God but not in a
[1:09:31] perceptive way that we would understand
[1:09:33] it I'm not saying I knew what I did when
[1:09:34] I was there I'm just telling you I was
[1:09:36] there all right
[1:09:37] now when we get to the end uh what
[1:09:39] wasn't there the New Jerusalem wasn't
[1:09:41] there okay Jesus Christ as king wasn't
[1:09:43] there uh me knowing him as king like I
[1:09:46] mean as a king the tour can buy me
[1:09:48] knowing him as a king that thought
[1:09:50] wasn't there okay save Nations weren't
[1:09:54] there because they weren't
[1:09:55] the kings of the earth weren't there
[1:09:56] there are things in the and this one
[1:09:58] that weren't at that one right and we're
[1:10:00] going to go through and find out where
[1:10:00] they come from how'd they turn up
[1:10:02] okay with me so far okay good
[1:10:06] so that was the new one built this one
[1:10:08] was built after that one that's why it
[1:10:09] differs in creation but we can still
[1:10:10] apply that creation to this one now when
[1:10:13] this happened in time I don't know
[1:10:14] because we sometimes can't relate at all
[1:10:16] the time but there was a war in heaven
[1:10:17] at some point now
[1:10:19] the reason reason why we know this is
[1:10:21] because Isaiah it says how out there
[1:10:24] falling from Heaven are Lucifer son of
[1:10:25] the morning how about they are cut down
[1:10:26] to the ground which says weaken the
[1:10:28] Nations for thou I set a known heart all
[1:10:29] Ascend unto Heaven I'll exalt my throne
[1:10:32] above the stars of God also also upon
[1:10:34] the Mount of the congregation and the
[1:10:35] sides of the north it was a conflict
[1:10:37] between who was going to be in power up
[1:10:38] there and this fight ensued and the
[1:10:42] Bible says and there appeared another
[1:10:43] Wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[1:10:44] dragon having seven heads and ten horns
[1:10:46] and seven crowns upon his head and his
[1:10:48] tail drew the third part of the stars of
[1:10:50] heaven and did cast them down to the
[1:10:52] earth and the dragon stood before the
[1:10:54] woman which was ready to be delivered
[1:10:55] for to devour her children as soon as it
[1:10:57] was born the reason why I put that one
[1:10:58] into you is because Satan had to have
[1:11:00] some sort of kingdom and we've always
[1:11:01] thought well he's got a third of the
[1:11:02] Angels it comes from the scripture here
[1:11:04] that we would imply that that means he's
[1:11:06] the third of the angels went with him
[1:11:09] deciding that he was going to be their
[1:11:11] King rather than Jesus Christ so that's
[1:11:13] how we get this concept if you ever
[1:11:14] wonder where the third came from it's
[1:11:15] there and that's what I wanted to bring
[1:11:16] out these things like I can't just say a
[1:11:18] third
[1:11:19] I can't show you what why the third
[1:11:21] means right
[1:11:22] and then this one says and there was war
[1:11:24] in heaven and Michael and his angels
[1:11:26] fought against the dragon and the dragon
[1:11:27] fought and his angels and prevailed not
[1:11:29] neither was their place found any more
[1:11:31] in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast
[1:11:32] out that old serpent called the devil
[1:11:34] and saved him which deceive of the whole
[1:11:35] earth he was cast onto the Earth and his
[1:11:38] angels will cast that with him about a
[1:11:40] third we'll cast that with them okay
[1:11:41] yeah so this this battle happened at
[1:11:44] this point in time the Earth was made
[1:11:45] then okay so because it was this Earth
[1:11:48] here was in existence and I believe the
[1:11:49] other one was because that was their
[1:11:51] first then this one was here so this
[1:11:53] thing happened at some point
[1:11:54] around there now I want to just read you
[1:11:56] some unusual quotes and then I want to
[1:11:59] try and explain what they mean because
[1:12:00] to me they were unusual I think what do
[1:12:01] these quotes mean this is unusual
[1:12:03] now the souls that were in prison that
[1:12:05] repented not were not Angelic beings
[1:12:07] that had had been brought down into in
[1:12:10] the form of angels but it was the
[1:12:11] spirits of those Angelic beings that
[1:12:13] fell before the foundation of the world
[1:12:15] back there when the war went on in
[1:12:16] heaven and Satan and the dragon fought
[1:12:18] them or Michael and and the dragon Fort
[1:12:20] and Lucifer and Lucifer was cast out
[1:12:23] with all of his children all of his
[1:12:24] angels that he had deceived and those
[1:12:26] angels came to the earth and the subject
[1:12:27] then to become human and when they did
[1:12:29] that's when the sons of God saw the
[1:12:31] doors of men that they were fair and
[1:12:32] took unto them wives okay that's an
[1:12:34] unusual concept he's saying they went
[1:12:35] down became humans that's unusual
[1:12:38] and there was a part of me Alma Neville
[1:12:40] and the rest of you all hear that's in
[1:12:42] Christ Jesus before the foundation of
[1:12:43] the world and here's to my analysis of
[1:12:45] that I think that people today that are
[1:12:47] possessed with this Spirit uh or thus
[1:12:49] Spirit you talk about the Holy Spirit
[1:12:50] are a part of those Angelic beings which
[1:12:52] rotated off of God like that creation
[1:12:55] that never fell in the beginning and
[1:12:56] resisted their Devil's lie in heaven
[1:12:57] amen okay so saying yeah so he's saying
[1:13:01] now there's this group here that that we
[1:13:03] made a choice somewhere and so do these
[1:13:04] other guys because if we were there we
[1:13:06] had to make a choice too okay we didn't
[1:13:08] know I'm not saying we knew and all this
[1:13:09] but
[1:13:10] that's the way it was and one day when I
[1:13:12] was weary about myself I said you boy
[1:13:13] you better go ahead if you're 50 years
[1:13:15] old if you're ever going to do anything
[1:13:17] for the Lord you better hurry up and do
[1:13:18] it you're getting old see and there that
[1:13:21] morning the quickening power came and he
[1:13:23] let me look over the curtain and I've
[1:13:25] seen all of you there
[1:13:28] yeah hi when I went there today I saw
[1:13:31] you there I thought I was here
[1:13:33] well you've got an eternal being
[1:13:34] somewhere and that was seen think of the
[1:13:37] realm just all stretches to make this
[1:13:38] all work somehow or another
[1:13:40] we're not that smart but we just believe
[1:13:42] what the word of God says all that we
[1:13:44] have loved and all that love you they
[1:13:46] give to you see I've seen all of them
[1:13:48] over there like that what was that
[1:13:48] quickening power amen okay now now there
[1:13:52] you are that's the way we are here we
[1:13:54] come from a higher being in the
[1:13:55] beginning we were in the image of God
[1:13:59] um the veil and the Darkness keeps us
[1:14:01] from knowing it now because we're born
[1:14:02] into this realm okay but Jesus told his
[1:14:04] disciples he was with them before the
[1:14:06] foundation of the world see we were you
[1:14:09] can't know it now but you was in the
[1:14:10] beginning and if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:14:12] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:14:14] Hallelujah and then we move into this
[1:14:16] theophany once we have lived so we can
[1:14:17] eat and shake hands and that Souls under
[1:14:19] the altar cry how long
[1:14:22] when you turn up you don't know that you
[1:14:23] were there okay now now in this war In
[1:14:26] Heaven There Were Three there were three
[1:14:28] groups that emerged that took sides and
[1:14:31] things that happened in this war the
[1:14:33] first group were the children of God
[1:14:34] that resisted the LIE they said no we
[1:14:36] don't want to go with you right with his
[1:14:39] children that he made there he said no
[1:14:40] we're not we don't want this Jesus is
[1:14:42] our King right amen that's what you said
[1:14:46] think about this from that perspective
[1:14:48] there were angels that resisted about
[1:14:51] two-thirds of the Angels said no we're
[1:14:53] not keen on this okay and there were one
[1:14:55] third of the angels that said actually
[1:14:56] we'll go with us so there was a division
[1:14:58] happened and then that started a chain
[1:15:01] reaction of what we have now and the way
[1:15:02] that the Earth would unfold right now
[1:15:04] this might be an unusual concept but the
[1:15:06] fact of the matter is that all of these
[1:15:07] groups have the capacity to become a
[1:15:09] human
[1:15:10] the children of God that resisted the
[1:15:12] LIE the angels that resisted and the
[1:15:13] angels that went with the LIE have the
[1:15:15] capacity to become human in different
[1:15:16] forms but they do right I'll show you
[1:15:18] where I get that idea from so this is
[1:15:20] the first one the children that resisted
[1:15:21] delay
[1:15:22] Jesus says in the beginning was the word
[1:15:24] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:15:25] was God the same was in the beginning
[1:15:27] with God that's the word the logos that
[1:15:29] came out then it said the word was made
[1:15:30] flesh and dwelt Among Us okay now I can
[1:15:33] say okay if I'm theoretically of that
[1:15:35] same nature
[1:15:36] because I'm Made In His Image if I'm
[1:15:38] made like that as a son then I'm the
[1:15:41] same being as him and it says because he
[1:15:43] says I've met him as image then I have
[1:15:45] the capacity to then become a human me
[1:15:47] if Jesus can because he wasn't didn't
[1:15:49] have flesh there it wasn't flesh like
[1:15:51] this it was that being so so I say if he
[1:15:54] could do that then I have the capacity
[1:15:55] to come and become a human here okay
[1:15:58] that's how I say that's the first
[1:16:00] comparison capacity second one were the
[1:16:02] angels that resisted had the capacity to
[1:16:05] become human but not in the way that we
[1:16:06] think but still here's one in Genesis it
[1:16:08] says this is talking about
[1:16:10] um Sodom and it says There came two
[1:16:12] angels that evening and lot set in the
[1:16:14] gate of Sodom and lots seeing them rose
[1:16:16] up to meet them and he bowed himself
[1:16:17] with his face toward the ground and he
[1:16:18] said behold now my Lord's turn and I
[1:16:20] pray you into your servant's house and
[1:16:22] Terry all night and wash your feet and
[1:16:24] you shall rise up early and go your ways
[1:16:25] and they said they but we will abide in
[1:16:27] the street all night and he pressed them
[1:16:29] greatly convince them angels
[1:16:32] had a conversation
[1:16:35] and they turned on to him an incident to
[1:16:37] his house and he made them a feast and
[1:16:39] did bake unleavened bread and they did
[1:16:41] eat
[1:16:42] Angels came and talked to him and ate
[1:16:44] food
[1:16:45] sounds to me like they're a human being
[1:16:48] but they had special powers okay
[1:16:51] after the the men wanted to come in and
[1:16:53] know them I want to talk about one of
[1:16:55] the songs that we're saying right at the
[1:16:56] end too remind me that when I get to a
[1:16:57] spot okay I pledge allegiance to the
[1:17:00] lamb
[1:17:01] remind me of that right
[1:17:03] they came to the door the men came to
[1:17:05] the door to want to know them sexually
[1:17:07] because they were all homosexuals and it
[1:17:09] says the men the Angels then smote the
[1:17:12] men that were at the door the house with
[1:17:13] blindness these guys had power they were
[1:17:14] humans with a supernatural power they
[1:17:17] smoked them with blindness both small
[1:17:18] and great so that they worried
[1:17:19] themselves to find the door and the men
[1:17:21] said unto them Lo hast thou hear any
[1:17:23] besides like son-in-law and thy sons and
[1:17:25] their daughters and whosoever thou Hast
[1:17:26] in the city bring them out of this place
[1:17:28] for we will destroy this place
[1:17:30] because the Cry of them is waxing great
[1:17:32] before the face of the Lord and the Lord
[1:17:33] sent us to destroy it these guys that
[1:17:36] looked like humans were coming to
[1:17:37] destroy the place okay this is why God
[1:17:39] says Satan can't create
[1:17:41] and become a human like that because
[1:17:43] what could he do just he would just
[1:17:44] destroy the place but these Angels were
[1:17:46] trustworthy because they resisted the
[1:17:48] license they could be trusted to become
[1:17:50] human and have this power to to blind
[1:17:52] people to destroy the place and then go
[1:17:54] back they were just going to do the job
[1:17:55] they were called doing here back they
[1:17:56] weren't gonna
[1:17:57] go Rogue and kill everybody because they
[1:18:00] could
[1:18:01] that's Supernatural Powers right now
[1:18:03] that's why that's why Paul says let
[1:18:05] Brotherly Love continue be not forgetful
[1:18:07] to entertain strangers for thereby some
[1:18:10] have entertained angels unawares some of
[1:18:12] the people you've spoken to in life
[1:18:13] could May well have been an angel
[1:18:15] because God can create he can just
[1:18:16] create a body and this Angelic being has
[1:18:18] the capacity to come into that body and
[1:18:20] function like a human eat talk be
[1:18:22] reasoned with sure come in no no I'm not
[1:18:25] going to no please no no please don't
[1:18:26] just come in okay
[1:18:29] isn't it how we do it as humans we feel
[1:18:32] the pressure the emotion he really wants
[1:18:33] me to come in but I don't want to but I
[1:18:34] just can't resist it
[1:18:36] right
[1:18:37] now the angels that went with the LIE
[1:18:40] this is how I can I'm going to do a bit
[1:18:41] of coloring in in some places like if I
[1:18:43] see a tree that's not colored in I'm
[1:18:44] going to say well I assume that tree's
[1:18:46] green if I see some water I'm going to
[1:18:48] say well I assume that water is blue do
[1:18:50] you understand
[1:18:52] now it may not be blue it may be green
[1:18:56] maybe you're dirty like maybe Brown okay
[1:18:58] but I'm gonna where I think the needs
[1:19:00] color I color it in okay
[1:19:02] now
[1:19:04] firstly how many how many Angels were
[1:19:06] there
[1:19:07] Hebrews 12 22 says but yeah come to the
[1:19:09] Mount Zion until the city of the Living
[1:19:11] God and to the Heavenly Jerusalem and to
[1:19:13] an innumerable company of angels
[1:19:15] so it says God's got an innumerable
[1:19:17] company so if I said he's got a third of
[1:19:19] an innumerable company
[1:19:21] how many angels does he have right a lot
[1:19:24] now you could say well maybe he made
[1:19:25] more when they left I think he still had
[1:19:27] an innumerable number and a third of
[1:19:28] that left okay so this is how many
[1:19:30] beings are there somewhere
[1:19:32] all right now this is why when I come
[1:19:34] back to this one this quote here the one
[1:19:36] who I've underlined and Lucifer was cast
[1:19:37] out with all of his angels children all
[1:19:39] of the Angels here deceived and those
[1:19:41] Angels Came To Earth and was subject
[1:19:42] then to become human to become Satan's
[1:19:44] Children on this Earth okay
[1:19:46] now when God when God formed man it says
[1:19:50] he took the dust of the earth and he
[1:19:51] formed man and he made him from the dust
[1:19:53] but remember there was already a man
[1:19:55] the first one I believe there was a man
[1:19:57] already made he was making Adam after
[1:20:00] something that was already made right I
[1:20:03] can say this of Adam because he was the
[1:20:04] handiwork of God I can say this with
[1:20:06] assurance
[1:20:08] as much as I can say about me I had a
[1:20:09] representation but Adam had
[1:20:11] representation So Adam was made as a as
[1:20:14] a being first like Jesus was as a being
[1:20:16] there when he was made in the dust of
[1:20:18] this Earth if God formed him after that
[1:20:21] because this just reflected that right
[1:20:23] that's why that one's waiting when he
[1:20:25] goes and gets his body it's going to
[1:20:26] look like Adam
[1:20:28] people who knew Adam are going to say
[1:20:30] that's Adam they're not going to look
[1:20:32] around oh by the way I'm Adam and he's a
[1:20:34] he looks totally different he's going to
[1:20:35] be Adam
[1:20:36] okay
[1:20:37] now it says after that Genesis 2 when
[1:20:40] the Lord God calls the Deep Sleep to
[1:20:41] fall upon Adam and he slept and took one
[1:20:43] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[1:20:44] thereof instead thereof and the robots
[1:20:47] of the Lord God had taken from the man
[1:20:48] made he a woman and he brought her unto
[1:20:49] the man
[1:20:50] so from the man now this is this will
[1:20:52] happen in this time because it was to
[1:20:54] show something but remember in the
[1:20:55] beginning he made male and a female
[1:20:56] separate when they were made here he
[1:20:59] made them like he called their name Adam
[1:21:00] because he had to show something but
[1:21:02] when he made them there they were
[1:21:03] separate okay
[1:21:05] this here this here is just to play yeah
[1:21:08] yeah brother bandham says it starts here
[1:21:09] and it ends here and all the stuff in
[1:21:11] here doesn't matter
[1:21:13] we were there we were there at the
[1:21:14] beginning we're going to be there at the
[1:21:15] end all the stuff doesn't matter okay
[1:21:17] just think about it that way it's it's
[1:21:19] just to play out of purpose
[1:21:22] but I believe that because Eve was
[1:21:23] created from the hand of God through
[1:21:26] Adam as a type but still created from
[1:21:28] this Earth that she had representation
[1:21:30] okay now within this Garden we had
[1:21:33] another being there called The Serpent
[1:21:34] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:21:36] beast of the field which the Lord God
[1:21:37] had made and he said unto the woman yes
[1:21:39] God said you should not eat of every
[1:21:40] tree of the garden
[1:21:43] now this being had a conversation with
[1:21:45] Eve
[1:21:46] and she said she said yes we can but of
[1:21:49] the fruit of the tree which is in the
[1:21:50] midst of the garden metaphorically your
[1:21:52] genitalia and that means you're not
[1:21:54] don't touch it unless you die God I said
[1:21:56] you should not touch unless you die okay
[1:21:58] now this this being here was almost like
[1:22:02] a human it said it was the most cunning
[1:22:04] of all the world the animals the Lord
[1:22:06] God had made the Beast of the earth it
[1:22:07] was most cunning we see innate reason to
[1:22:09] be cunning but there was one in between
[1:22:10] that and Mankind that was more cunning
[1:22:12] it said it walked upright and it said it
[1:22:14] could talk it wasn't a snake pissing
[1:22:16] around the ground it walked upright and
[1:22:17] it could talk it could have a
[1:22:18] conversation because God just made
[1:22:20] things went up and up and up and up and
[1:22:21] up and that was the one when he made
[1:22:23] that he's like it's not it's not quite
[1:22:24] what I am yet one more step up and it'll
[1:22:27] be man now this this being was if this
[1:22:30] didn't happen it would have still been
[1:22:30] there maybe it was the help it helped
[1:22:32] out move things was big and strong it
[1:22:33] did whatever right and when the woman
[1:22:36] saw that the tree was good for food and
[1:22:38] it was pleasant for the eyes and the
[1:22:39] tree to be desired to make one while she
[1:22:41] took of the fruit the Roman did eat and
[1:22:42] gave also unto her husband and he did
[1:22:43] eat and the eyes of both of them were
[1:22:45] opened and they knew that they were
[1:22:47] naked and they sewed themselves quick
[1:22:49] leaves together and made themselves
[1:22:50] aprons okay so they committed a sexual
[1:22:52] act she committed one with the serpent
[1:22:54] and one with
[1:22:55] Adam okay that's why
[1:22:58] you had the first thing you had was they
[1:23:00] knew they were naked before that they
[1:23:01] didn't know because and they didn't know
[1:23:03] to even do that but Satan knew that's
[1:23:05] what could happen so he got into the
[1:23:07] serpent now that wasn't Satan that was
[1:23:08] still a being okay yeah yeah
[1:23:11] now there was the result of that what
[1:23:14] did God say there's going to be war
[1:23:15] between the serpent seed and your seed
[1:23:18] amen right now the woman doesn't have a
[1:23:20] seed he was referencing to Christ the
[1:23:21] seed of Christ that will come in but
[1:23:23] there's going to be a war between these
[1:23:24] seeds essentially the sons of God and
[1:23:26] and the Sons of Satan is going to be a
[1:23:28] war and he said to Eve you're going to
[1:23:30] have being pain bearing children
[1:23:32] this is clear as day when you see it and
[1:23:35] you curse the serpent down to the ground
[1:23:36] we see pictures of him a snake wasn't a
[1:23:38] snake it was up walking around that guy
[1:23:40] cursed to the ground and they knew they
[1:23:41] were naked
[1:23:43] you had an issue happen here something
[1:23:45] strange happened upon the Earth as a
[1:23:47] result of this you had two beings born
[1:23:51] you had that and you had what we would
[1:23:52] call a hybrid because
[1:23:54] species that are alike but not quite
[1:23:56] alike but almost a light can be together
[1:23:59] and create something now sometimes
[1:24:00] they're fertile sometimes they're not
[1:24:01] but hybrids do happen okay
[1:24:05] the these are some hybrids here and
[1:24:08] biology a hybrid is The Offspring
[1:24:10] resulting from a combination from
[1:24:12] combining the qualities of two organisms
[1:24:13] or different breeds varieties species or
[1:24:16] something together through sexual
[1:24:17] reproduction It generally means that
[1:24:19] each cell has genetic material from two
[1:24:21] different organisms whereas an
[1:24:23] individual where some cells are derived
[1:24:25] from a different organism is called a
[1:24:27] chimera hybrids are not always
[1:24:29] intermediate intermediates between the
[1:24:31] appearance such as Blended inheritance
[1:24:33] but can show hybrid Vigor sometimes
[1:24:35] growing larger or taller than either
[1:24:36] parent yeah okay
[1:24:38] think about a hybrid because what we had
[1:24:40] here
[1:24:41] I want you to see this real clear
[1:24:44] this is very important this was one of
[1:24:45] the hardest things for me to kind of get
[1:24:47] my head around we had a hybrid being now
[1:24:50] okay but I want to just get our mind
[1:24:52] into this hybrid the first idea blint
[1:24:54] they had this idea of blending
[1:24:55] inheritance that was um Charles Darwin
[1:24:57] he got a lot of things wrong and this
[1:24:58] was one of them
[1:24:59] that's what says his theory was that
[1:25:02] when you hybrid things together the
[1:25:04] seeds blend together and eventually they
[1:25:05] just become a mix of those seeds
[1:25:08] and so that in theory if you had a white
[1:25:10] flower and a red flower eventually those
[1:25:12] particles would cease to bend there
[1:25:13] would only be the the pink would only be
[1:25:16] in existence forever so he said the
[1:25:17] seeds actually mixed together
[1:25:20] um but people come out and say no that's
[1:25:21] wrong other more smarter men than him
[1:25:24] told him he was wrong we're still doing
[1:25:27] the same today but
[1:25:28] these other men came out and they said
[1:25:30] no it's not it's not um blending
[1:25:32] inheritance it's particulate inheritance
[1:25:34] which is a pattern of inheritance
[1:25:36] discovered by these guys
[1:25:38] showing that phonetic traits can be
[1:25:40] passed from generation to generation
[1:25:41] through discrete particles known as
[1:25:43] genes which can keep their ability to be
[1:25:45] expressed while not always appearing in
[1:25:47] a descending generation
[1:25:48] okay they can just stay there and never
[1:25:50] be expressed they just they can be 100
[1:25:52] years and then it comes out yeah
[1:25:54] and they never mix all right now the
[1:25:56] blending model versus a particular model
[1:25:57] is The Offspring which is the wrong one
[1:25:59] The Offspring are a blend of both
[1:26:00] parents are actually Blended together to
[1:26:02] create a new seed and the
[1:26:03] characteristics of the Blended offspring
[1:26:05] are passed to the Next Generation so
[1:26:06] that Blended mix goes on which is not
[1:26:09] correct that separate ones pass through
[1:26:11] right and variation is washed out over
[1:26:14] time which is not true variation always
[1:26:16] stays the real one is The Offspring are
[1:26:19] a combination of both parents the
[1:26:21] characteristics of both parents are
[1:26:22] passed on to the next Generation
[1:26:23] separate entities to be used either way
[1:26:25] and variation is maintained over time
[1:26:27] these things never mix okay
[1:26:30] okay
[1:26:31] now I need to ask a hard question here
[1:26:34] then when this being emerged
[1:26:37] and next to the human being was a
[1:26:39] serpent the Bible said he was smart the
[1:26:41] most subtle of all the beasts of the
[1:26:42] field smarter he almost had a soul
[1:26:44] he had a place for his soul but what did
[1:26:46] he do he sold out to Satan to deceive
[1:26:47] God try to how many gets that so far
[1:26:50] Satan the serpent almost had a soul God
[1:26:52] note they'd look for those bones and
[1:26:54] there's not a bone and a snake that
[1:26:55] looks like a man he was that's the curse
[1:26:57] of him he stood on his feet just like a
[1:26:58] man
[1:27:00] okay right now but the surfer never sold
[1:27:03] no
[1:27:04] it was an animal
[1:27:06] that could mix with man okay
[1:27:09] now I wanna these are hard questions but
[1:27:11] if I said if I looked at the first being
[1:27:13] here that actually now I'm not going to
[1:27:15] call him directly a Son of God because
[1:27:17] he was a son of Abel was the son of Adam
[1:27:19] and Eve we can't confirm whether he had
[1:27:21] representation
[1:27:23] we don't know that
[1:27:25] think about that I'll show you
[1:27:27] but was he technically a Son of God
[1:27:29] because he was because he I'm not trying
[1:27:32] to trick you and you say yes and I say
[1:27:33] no it wasn't because this is not that
[1:27:34] I'm just going through it
[1:27:37] uh first one did he have a soul I would
[1:27:39] say yes because Adam here about an eve
[1:27:42] had one and so they would they passed on
[1:27:44] that now I don't know where a soul is
[1:27:45] and how it gets passed down as your
[1:27:46] genetic makeup but he had something he
[1:27:49] had what we would call a soul okay is he
[1:27:51] a Son of God in that respect I'm going
[1:27:52] to say he was made from that now I'd say
[1:27:55] is he savable
[1:27:56] yes right does he have representation
[1:27:59] that I'm not sure I'm not sure that he
[1:28:01] did we have to be honest I don't know
[1:28:02] because he was a product of something
[1:28:04] they weren't supposed to do
[1:28:05] he may not have had representation but
[1:28:07] he's still savable and we'll get to that
[1:28:08] in a bit as he fertile a meaning can he
[1:28:10] reproduce
[1:28:12] uh physically yes and spiritually yes
[1:28:14] because two Souls came together okay so
[1:28:16] that I'm gonna call it like that right
[1:28:18] now also if I just I just need to labor
[1:28:21] on this for a second if I would go to
[1:28:22] the other one did he have a soul it's a
[1:28:24] hard question but I'm going to have to
[1:28:25] answer it and say no not a soul in terms
[1:28:27] of what these other guys had assault
[1:28:29] because it was a hybrid right is he a
[1:28:31] Son of God no
[1:28:33] is he savable no
[1:28:35] no right does he have representation no
[1:28:39] is he fertile well
[1:28:41] hybrids can be fertile in a natural
[1:28:43] sense like a hybrid can actually hybrids
[1:28:45] can breed and become fertile his body
[1:28:47] yes his Spirit what was that that did
[1:28:50] that could that Soul live on
[1:28:52] and be saved and go on
[1:28:55] no
[1:28:56] so now
[1:28:58] what you had to have here you this being
[1:29:01] had to have an origin somewhere now this
[1:29:02] is why we have to I said if we want to
[1:29:04] see us we rejoice when we say that was
[1:29:05] me there we have to paint a picture and
[1:29:07] say there's got to be this side on that
[1:29:08] side it's got to be light there's got to
[1:29:10] be Darkness there has to be something
[1:29:11] where there was one here and one there
[1:29:13] so that's why when we when we say this
[1:29:15] what origin where did that what was what
[1:29:17] was then came to then Express where was
[1:29:19] that that's why I believe that was one
[1:29:21] of those he he was one of those beings
[1:29:23] that came every time one of those seeds
[1:29:25] are born that being from there from Hell
[1:29:28] comes in a bit that's him becomes one of
[1:29:31] them that's the that's why Cain killed
[1:29:32] his brother he hated God he could just
[1:29:34] fight against God because he was that
[1:29:35] line and he just and he had an end point
[1:29:37] once he was finished now we'll get to
[1:29:40] how this could work in the end but if
[1:29:42] you notice the parable of the wheat and
[1:29:43] the tears
[1:29:45] God says what well me and sleep this
[1:29:46] enemy came in and sowed tears among the
[1:29:48] wheat and went their way and he said
[1:29:49] this is about creation he said the field
[1:29:51] is the word the good seed are the
[1:29:52] children of the Kingdom but the tears
[1:29:54] are the children of the wicked one now a
[1:29:56] tear is going to stay a tear from when
[1:29:58] it's born to when it dies tear does not
[1:30:00] get converted to become a wheat a wheat
[1:30:02] is going to be a week when it's born to
[1:30:03] when it dies
[1:30:05] okay they can't change a rainbow Trout's
[1:30:07] going to be a rainbow trout yeah
[1:30:09] uh an eel is going to be an eel they
[1:30:12] cannot change this is why Jesus said of
[1:30:15] these men I don't have the power or the
[1:30:17] capacity to say who's who but he said
[1:30:19] ear of your father the devil
[1:30:21] they now don't forget these men killed
[1:30:23] him in the end where did that come from
[1:30:25] who was a murderer and alive from the
[1:30:26] beginning he's not just metaphorical
[1:30:28] Europe your father the devil
[1:30:30] okay and the lust of your father you
[1:30:33] will do and he was a murderer from the
[1:30:34] beginning and about not on the truth
[1:30:35] because there was no truth in him when
[1:30:37] he speaketh the light he speaketh of his
[1:30:38] own for he is a liar and the father of
[1:30:40] it now I'm going to twist this around
[1:30:41] slightly this is I do a lot of reading
[1:30:43] all the time like I joke to people that
[1:30:45] and when I relax myself I read some sort
[1:30:47] of Hardcore conspiracy or something just
[1:30:49] to kind of I find it relaxing wow it's
[1:30:51] relaxing you know some people maybe want
[1:30:53] to laugh to relax like it puts me to
[1:30:55] sleep I just get so intrigued by it then
[1:30:57] I fall asleep right so this is my
[1:30:59] relaxing I read this sort of stuff now I
[1:31:01] came across this bit of material and I
[1:31:03] researched just a bit more but this will
[1:31:04] Intrigue you okay
[1:31:06] uh now this is another man that's
[1:31:08] talking about his account of Genesis not
[1:31:10] not a not a Believer doesn't know
[1:31:12] brother Brown not that we understand
[1:31:13] right listen close but this is what he's
[1:31:16] understood it
[1:31:17] it's going to take me about two minutes
[1:31:18] to read this but it will it will
[1:31:19] Intrigue you right ask yourself was it
[1:31:22] really a fruit Adam and Eve ate that Dan
[1:31:24] Eden or is it the story referencing
[1:31:26] something much deeper in the human
[1:31:27] psyche
[1:31:29] I'm just repeating something else right
[1:31:30] there we don't believe we don't have to
[1:31:32] believe this but this is
[1:31:35] now further is the version of Eden
[1:31:37] taught to you the actual story or is it
[1:31:39] a red herring this guy's a Christian the
[1:31:41] luciferians have their version of Eden
[1:31:43] and I've never heard it put exactly like
[1:31:45] I do because I have not heard or read a
[1:31:47] person yet who has connected the dots
[1:31:48] like I have hasn't heard us
[1:31:50] so maybe my thoughts about this stuff
[1:31:53] will act as a serum serum disenchanting
[1:31:57] agent for our planetary plate I'll say
[1:31:58] this hearing the luciferian version of a
[1:32:01] version of Eden for me was in fact an
[1:32:02] experience of Satori it clarified the
[1:32:04] Eliza connected the dots and most
[1:32:06] importantly it helped to explain the
[1:32:08] extreme extremely anti-human motivations
[1:32:10] and behaviors throughout history and
[1:32:12] even today this is a guy that looks into
[1:32:13] the Demonic parts of the world that the
[1:32:15] evil stuff that happens these guys look
[1:32:17] into that and think he's trying to
[1:32:18] understand why is there so much evil
[1:32:19] like child rape in these things and
[1:32:21] these guys are just evil and they don't
[1:32:23] have any right luciferians
[1:32:27] luciferians have run the world
[1:32:30] since organized human history began they
[1:32:32] have been steering and shaping the
[1:32:33] planetary cultural Vector since long
[1:32:35] before the United States Rome or even
[1:32:36] the Egyptians the cult goes way back to
[1:32:38] and is known as the old religion they
[1:32:40] have maintained direct contact with a
[1:32:42] fourth dimensional being known as
[1:32:43] Lucifer for thousands of years Lucifer
[1:32:45] is parasitical genderless
[1:32:47] whatever that word is whatever that word
[1:32:49] it has been
[1:32:53] anthromorphized into human recognizable
[1:32:55] forms and names throughout the time like
[1:32:57] just saying he's coming as different
[1:32:58] beings right all over the world
[1:33:00] it and the Legion of other fourth
[1:33:03] dimensional beings like it have
[1:33:04] pilferred the human race since the
[1:33:06] beginning luciferians communicate
[1:33:08] directly with Lucifer through the ritual
[1:33:09] practice of child sacrifice that goes on
[1:33:11] today this practice to invoke and
[1:33:13] convene with Leviathan originated in the
[1:33:15] cult of Baal which we Rave read about in
[1:33:17] the Bible bail is just another name for
[1:33:18] Leviathan or Lucifer or molar these will
[1:33:21] reference the same energy The Cult of
[1:33:23] Baal which is the oldest cult ever
[1:33:24] established on this planet is the
[1:33:25] ancient precursor to luciferianism
[1:33:27] luciferian I personally considered to be
[1:33:30] a simply a formalized and highly
[1:33:31] organized Cult of bayonet I forget there
[1:33:34] were people in the Old Testament they
[1:33:35] would say these people sacrifice their
[1:33:36] children they were evil people
[1:33:38] who sacrifices children
[1:33:40] right
[1:33:42] the the mirror govern Line This is a
[1:33:45] line upon the Earth
[1:33:47] here is the most secret of all the
[1:33:48] luciferian families they world the most
[1:33:50] power as they carry the pure Satan
[1:33:52] satanic genetic I'll refer back to that
[1:33:54] throughout the slideshow and he's named
[1:33:56] a few names and I've blocked them out
[1:33:57] because I'm not about to name anybody in
[1:33:58] this because I can't say who's who right
[1:33:59] so I've blocked the names out that's not
[1:34:01] my
[1:34:02] it's not my job to do that to say who's
[1:34:05] who names are changed and luciferianism
[1:34:07] to hide Detroit identities of the
[1:34:09] individuals or virtually every U.S
[1:34:10] Congress everyone namely newest Congress
[1:34:12] will be on those 14 families these guys
[1:34:14] have said these families that run the
[1:34:15] world and it will be obvious that Coop
[1:34:17] has been pilfering the United States
[1:34:18] since a succession Inception more
[1:34:21] information on the families can be found
[1:34:22] in the 1995 PDF Bloodlines of the
[1:34:24] Illuminati which I then went and read
[1:34:26] luciferians Trace their bloodlines back
[1:34:27] all the way past the amalekites who
[1:34:29] practice these same cannibalistic human
[1:34:30] sacrificing rituals Bloodlines are
[1:34:32] desperately important to these people
[1:34:34] because blood carries luciferous energy
[1:34:35] they must keep the genetic pure from us
[1:34:38] normies who are not from the blue
[1:34:39] bloodline of Satan understand these
[1:34:41] child murdering cultures believe they
[1:34:43] are direct descendants of the bloodline
[1:34:44] of Cain as in the Book of Genesis Cain
[1:34:46] enabled the two there's one twin sons of
[1:34:49] Eep as we know Cain murdered Abel
[1:34:51] right
[1:34:53] luciferians believe Lucifer was
[1:34:55] literally the father of Cain and Adam
[1:34:56] the father of Abel according to them Eve
[1:34:59] at intercourse twice that day once was
[1:35:01] the demagogue and once with a human she
[1:35:03] became pregnant with twin boys the key
[1:35:04] obfuscation and the biblical story is
[1:35:06] that Eve's boys had different male
[1:35:07] fathers Lucifer was the first event of
[1:35:10] course with even then Adam luciferians
[1:35:11] believed the line of Cain carries the
[1:35:13] original genetics of Leviathan not a
[1:35:15] leviath or neviathlon they believe
[1:35:16] physical sex is essential
[1:35:20] blah blah blah so they're saying next
[1:35:22] one sound like Abe Abel came to not in
[1:35:24] here at Living DNA from his father he
[1:35:25] narrowed a DNA from a demon now that's
[1:35:27] wrong it was from the serpent yes right
[1:35:30] but I researched this and this is common
[1:35:31] knowledge um this is common amongst this
[1:35:34] luciferian thing is that's where we come
[1:35:36] from
[1:35:38] they say Eve they believe this
[1:35:41] but they say there of that yes right
[1:35:44] okay
[1:35:46] so now this explains why when you
[1:35:49] understand that the origin of some
[1:35:51] people on this Earth
[1:35:52] from hell
[1:35:54] okay I'm gonna get to the other people
[1:35:56] soon but this is why you you haven't
[1:35:58] funny stories in the Bible where Pharaoh
[1:36:00] the Moses came to pharaoh and had a
[1:36:02] stick and he threw it down and became a
[1:36:03] snake
[1:36:04] and then Pharaoh's magicians
[1:36:06] got a staff threw it down and became a
[1:36:09] snake
[1:36:10] now I don't believe they had it behind
[1:36:11] their back and a snake in the bag and
[1:36:12] did a slight of hand and threw a snake
[1:36:14] down it turned into a snake
[1:36:16] right Satan doesn't have power to turn a
[1:36:19] stick into a snake that's why if you
[1:36:21] follow brother Brown and what he says
[1:36:22] about it he says Satan cannot create so
[1:36:24] you've got to get that thought out of
[1:36:25] your mind but this will still make sense
[1:36:27] Satan can almost create in this sense
[1:36:28] when he when because human beings are
[1:36:31] made like God and we have the capacity
[1:36:32] to create and to speak and to believe
[1:36:34] that's a that's a trait of humanity we
[1:36:37] are made like God so we have the
[1:36:38] capacity to create slightly so if Satan
[1:36:42] all he's got to do is try and convince
[1:36:43] his people if they can believe it enough
[1:36:45] they can buy that same power of human
[1:36:48] inspired by Satan
[1:36:50] make the staff turn into a snake
[1:36:53] now they're humans like us they can't
[1:36:55] they don't they just have to learn it
[1:36:57] all the same as we do yeah
[1:36:58] right but and here they clearly had the
[1:37:01] power to do the same thing because but
[1:37:03] it didn't come from God they were
[1:37:04] resisting god with the power of humanity
[1:37:06] inspired by Satan that well you that's
[1:37:08] why you can't get caught up well there's
[1:37:10] a miracle I believe that
[1:37:11] that's right hey he said by the fruits
[1:37:15] you shall know them the fruits where
[1:37:16] they were fighting against the word of
[1:37:18] God that was coming from Satan they did
[1:37:20] a miracle most people would believe it
[1:37:22] while they threw a staff down I believe
[1:37:23] them too maybe I don't believe Moses
[1:37:25] right
[1:37:27] that there's a lot of those
[1:37:29] now if I didn't want to put any pictures
[1:37:30] here or names or anything but
[1:37:32] in this modern realm we think that all
[1:37:34] that evil stuff has gone away it hasn't
[1:37:35] there's evil that happens on this Earth
[1:37:38] satanic evil
[1:37:40] some of it gets uncovered but it
[1:37:42] generally Satan runs the world he knows
[1:37:44] who was children are
[1:37:46] and he gives them positions they just
[1:37:48] you hear stories well that guy got this
[1:37:50] he got there he got up to that position
[1:37:51] Satan gives us people positions this is
[1:37:53] how it works right that's right and
[1:37:55] there are there are there's evil stuff
[1:37:56] there's
[1:37:58] you don't want to watch the stuff you
[1:38:00] know the things that happen the the
[1:38:02] children being taken uncertain and it's
[1:38:04] always around the time where they have
[1:38:05] these festivals these satanic ones and
[1:38:07] children's go missing these children are
[1:38:08] killed but who does that they murdered
[1:38:11] like and and wealthy people that you
[1:38:13] think are wealthy and are normal people
[1:38:14] are involved in this pedophilia and
[1:38:16] stuff that you think and recently some
[1:38:19] were caught and the people that expose
[1:38:20] it end up dying even the people who
[1:38:22] exposed some recent stuff laptops in
[1:38:24] that about eight of those guys that did
[1:38:25] they did you're only 12 of them nine of
[1:38:27] them are dead why they did
[1:38:30] why is someone that was going to expose
[1:38:32] he had a book of names who was what to
[1:38:33] try and maybe had a change of heart he's
[1:38:35] dead why is he dead because there's evil
[1:38:38] okay this
[1:38:39] and this evil comes directly from hell
[1:38:41] it just these these things don't now I
[1:38:45] don't not going to name anybody but I
[1:38:46] just need to name principles right
[1:38:47] because we wouldn't do that in ourselves
[1:38:48] right
[1:38:49] let me just talk to this real quick go
[1:38:51] through this
[1:38:53] Nephilim right we the in the King James
[1:38:56] that calls them the Giants but their the
[1:38:58] name it's always preferred to whether
[1:38:59] the Nephilim
[1:39:01] and these were these were when when um
[1:39:05] and and Genesis 6 it talks about the
[1:39:07] Nephilim or the Giants were on the earth
[1:39:08] in those days and when the sons of God
[1:39:09] had sexual relations with the daughters
[1:39:11] of man it gave birth to their children
[1:39:12] they were The Mighty Heroes of old the
[1:39:14] famous men Young's translation down here
[1:39:17] uh he Tran they they're quite good
[1:39:19] because they just translate word for
[1:39:20] word but they use it a bit different
[1:39:22] they say the Fallen ones were on the
[1:39:23] earth in those days now Nephilim doesn't
[1:39:26] really mean you could you could take
[1:39:27] that Nephilim means Fallen ones because
[1:39:29] it's a word put together but these there
[1:39:33] was a giant race on the earth these
[1:39:34] Nephilim people also appeared After the
[1:39:36] flood
[1:39:37] this was before the flood and after the
[1:39:39] flood these Giants appeared we're
[1:39:41] talking big people
[1:39:43] yeah bigger than the ceiling big people
[1:39:44] what happens when you hybrid
[1:39:47] you get big people now
[1:39:49] and they're different people back then
[1:39:52] knew there was a difference the sons of
[1:39:53] God went with the daughters of men they
[1:39:55] knew there was a difference in these
[1:39:56] races these two things going on here
[1:39:57] you're different than us right
[1:39:59] and this is the one after the flood
[1:40:02] but brother Brandon CC I was speaking
[1:40:03] here a few nights ago somewhere upon the
[1:40:05] subject of naranas in his days take
[1:40:07] Genesis 6 when the sons of God saw the
[1:40:09] doors of men and once I was studying
[1:40:11] history I was listening to what the
[1:40:12] historian was giving this when I beat
[1:40:14] your pardon it was a commentary on what
[1:40:16] he thought the sons of God was he said
[1:40:18] it was fallen angels that press
[1:40:19] themselves into human flesh and seen
[1:40:21] woman and how appealing this woman was
[1:40:23] and these sons of God became flesh if
[1:40:25] you take it that way I thought my
[1:40:26] precious brother you're more smarter
[1:40:28] than I but if you want to do that you
[1:40:30] make the devil a Creator so the devil
[1:40:31] cannot create now the reason why these
[1:40:34] guys want to figure out what's going on
[1:40:35] is because they know something's going
[1:40:36] on they know there's something different
[1:40:38] here Something's Happened we just don't
[1:40:39] know what to create two races to create
[1:40:41] these people that they're calling the
[1:40:43] Fallen ones the these people and these
[1:40:45] people so
[1:40:47] yeah this is how big they are there's
[1:40:50] you and me
[1:40:51] there's Arman
[1:40:53] yeah these are bones they've found these
[1:40:54] guys are big you think you're Big Ed
[1:40:57] you're a
[1:40:59] [Laughter]
[1:41:02] I'm not saying all big people are from
[1:41:04] Satan but that's
[1:41:06] Bible the Christian Old Testament a
[1:41:08] group of mysterious beings or or people
[1:41:10] of unusually large size and strength you
[1:41:12] live be both Before and After the flood
[1:41:14] and if the Nephilim are reference in
[1:41:16] Genesis and numbers and are possibly
[1:41:17] referred to an Ezekiel the Hebrew word
[1:41:19] Nephilim is sometimes directly
[1:41:20] translated as Giants or taken to mean
[1:41:22] that Fallen ones from the Hebrew nephil
[1:41:24] to fall
[1:41:26] but the identity of the Nephilim is
[1:41:28] debated by Scholars so it could go
[1:41:29] either way
[1:41:31] we had a situation on Earth where you
[1:41:33] had this happening now
[1:41:35] from the genes from the hybrid thing
[1:41:37] happening you had this yes okay now I'm
[1:41:39] not going to say that every one of those
[1:41:40] were Son Of Satan because I believe the
[1:41:43] the being that comes together inside the
[1:41:46] DNA
[1:41:50] I'm going to say it now
[1:41:53] you had cane you had able right Cain was
[1:41:56] part of his mother that DNA and part of
[1:41:59] that DNA right now in order for him to
[1:42:01] carry on and and reproduce he had to
[1:42:04] because Humanity's seed was quite pure
[1:42:06] he had to go with his sister
[1:42:09] and his anyway her sister was a daughter
[1:42:11] of
[1:42:13] um Adam and Eve right so then the The
[1:42:16] Offspring of that had the DNA of Adam in
[1:42:19] it and the DNA of even it
[1:42:22] in the DNA of the serpent all three so
[1:42:24] the next one after that could fall
[1:42:26] either way it just stays there all the
[1:42:28] way through stays there never mixes it
[1:42:30] just stays it could fall either way okay
[1:42:31] you understand yeah so it's not like oh
[1:42:32] oh that's your father like these guys
[1:42:34] that do the Bloodlines it's like well
[1:42:35] it's not quite that simple if you can
[1:42:36] trace your blood back then now if you're
[1:42:38] happy to be in that line
[1:42:39] some people carried that through but it
[1:42:41] didn't come onto the my line when I was
[1:42:44] born I was we'll get to that
[1:42:46] but we had a situation
[1:42:48] we had a situation after 2000 years that
[1:42:51] these beings were there was quite a pure
[1:42:52] strand of being on the Earth
[1:42:54] and as a result after two thousand years
[1:42:56] what did I say the world became an evil
[1:42:58] place the Bible said the thoughts of
[1:43:00] man's heart were evil continually Satan
[1:43:02] had so much power on the earth because
[1:43:04] he concentrated it says Cain left then
[1:43:06] he went to this place and he was just
[1:43:08] concentrated with with their satanic
[1:43:09] ideas not all of them were like that but
[1:43:11] there was like a definite separation
[1:43:13] between the sons of God and these these
[1:43:16] this line they this line here as per
[1:43:18] usual became they built the cities they
[1:43:20] were wires they built their brass the
[1:43:22] things in brass they built houses they
[1:43:23] shepherded they did all these things all
[1:43:25] the intelligent things they did because
[1:43:26] that's what Satan uses is intelligence
[1:43:28] and that they built all that they had so
[1:43:30] much dominance I reckon they had TV and
[1:43:32] all sorts back then now the Earth was
[1:43:34] made with a firmament they this these
[1:43:36] guys were smart they weren't dumb we see
[1:43:39] the we see the pyramids that are still
[1:43:40] there we can't figure out how they made
[1:43:42] them that stuff is granite you know that
[1:43:44] was granite
[1:43:45] you asked brother Jimmy we cut granite
[1:43:47] slabs at work to make these table tops
[1:43:49] we cut Granite 30 mils he's got to get a
[1:43:51] grinder that spins that I don't know how
[1:43:53] many thousand RPM and cut one small line
[1:43:55] he's out there dust over his face going
[1:43:59] and that's the best tool we've got to
[1:44:01] cut that Granite that thick yes
[1:44:04] yes you can't tell me that guys made
[1:44:05] things that size with a hammer and
[1:44:08] chisel if we have to do that with any
[1:44:10] sort of hand tool we ain't doing it it's
[1:44:11] like that's impossible these things have
[1:44:14] been cut straight okay
[1:44:17] the man lies and Satan lies and says
[1:44:20] we've gotten we were dumb and we've got
[1:44:21] smarter and smarter and smarter that's
[1:44:23] nonsense they were very smart there
[1:44:25] smarter even so much they probably blew
[1:44:27] up the firmament with some sort of
[1:44:28] nuclear thing there was a water above
[1:44:29] the Earth clearly there was water there
[1:44:30] it came down on the earth that's why the
[1:44:32] Earth is 70 water and then The Fountains
[1:44:34] of the deep broke open I believe in God
[1:44:36] made the Earth and had an attention to
[1:44:37] making a man a land-dwelling being he
[1:44:40] didn't make it 70 water
[1:44:42] he's gonna make it 80 Earth 20 water
[1:44:46] it's now 70 because the water from the
[1:44:49] firmament came down and The Fountains of
[1:44:51] the deep broke open it probably got
[1:44:53] blown up by some nuclear thing their
[1:44:54] devised right that's right but you had
[1:44:56] this you had the situation where evil
[1:44:57] had become so predominant that at a
[1:44:59] point God said I'm done with it all I'm
[1:45:01] going to wipe the whole thing off and
[1:45:02] start again and that's what he did wiped
[1:45:03] out the whole thing now but the line's
[1:45:06] still carried on but it didn't have as
[1:45:07] much power after that because it it was
[1:45:09] it just wasn't as concentrated they sort
[1:45:11] of went out but it's still carrying on
[1:45:12] from there to where we are at today but
[1:45:15] I don't I believe that the capacity was
[1:45:16] a strong because it was sort of mixed
[1:45:18] through the flood and then it it just
[1:45:20] Satan then had to work his way back all
[1:45:22] his technology everything was gone
[1:45:23] flattened you had to start from the
[1:45:24] start again build it all up again okay
[1:45:28] so now
[1:45:30] by talking about this this is now if I
[1:45:34] just take don't take the little pink one
[1:45:35] there for now just take the other two
[1:45:37] these two made a choice before they got
[1:45:39] here that's why when they got here
[1:45:41] their Destiny was already determined
[1:45:43] right
[1:45:45] that's the only way that I can say that
[1:45:46] I can't be lost and that's the only way
[1:45:48] that I can say they can't be saved is
[1:45:50] that they had to have made some sort of
[1:45:51] decision because I can't just say well
[1:45:52] you can't just send someone I know God
[1:45:54] can do what he wants but my mind is like
[1:45:56] there has to be in this decision made
[1:45:58] somewhere
[1:45:59] okay it was made somewhere
[1:46:01] now
[1:46:03] and so was that one because that was
[1:46:05] from there right
[1:46:07] now you have this other being which is
[1:46:10] different because adamant you have
[1:46:12] another being that is born from the
[1:46:13] Earth
[1:46:14] okay
[1:46:15] let me just tell you a little bit about
[1:46:17] DNA who likes this is the this is an
[1:46:19] interesting subject I need to tell you
[1:46:20] this then I'm going to go back in DNA is
[1:46:22] like the code of the human body right
[1:46:24] it's this amazing code that says who you
[1:46:26] are what color your Skin's going to be
[1:46:28] how long your fingers are going to be
[1:46:29] how long your eyelashes are going to be
[1:46:30] how tall are you going to grow it's all
[1:46:32] coated in there and then when you get
[1:46:33] made it just follows the code that's
[1:46:35] made and you can't change it God said
[1:46:36] can you make one more here on your head
[1:46:38] you can't whatever's encoded in that
[1:46:40] tiny microscopic Gene
[1:46:42] is what you're going to be right here's
[1:46:44] a Data Center and um this is like the
[1:46:45] fifth largest in the world but I got it
[1:46:46] because they told me how much data it
[1:46:48] stores this is a 140 000 square meters
[1:46:50] our house's house is about 140 squares
[1:46:52] so it's the size of a thousand houses
[1:46:53] this Big Data Center and um it's about
[1:46:56] the fifth biggest there's another four
[1:46:57] bigger and it serves as a hub for Surfer
[1:47:00] farms and and uh various and data
[1:47:04] collect and installed by various
[1:47:05] government agencies including the NSAIDs
[1:47:07] with all the spying all your information
[1:47:08] gets put there and studies us study away
[1:47:13] it stores 12 extra bytes of data the
[1:47:16] only person interested in this will be
[1:47:17] um brother Matt he's not here so so okay
[1:47:20] if we talk about data I just want to
[1:47:22] show you how much data is stored in DNA
[1:47:24] it's estimated that one gram of DNA can
[1:47:26] hold 215 terabytes
[1:47:29] which is one million gigabytes of data
[1:47:32] 215 so it's like
[1:47:35] to give you we're like that means
[1:47:36] nothing okay this might mean something
[1:47:38] here all of the data that's stored in
[1:47:40] there you can fit on 12 teaspoons of DNA
[1:47:43] information wise right that's how this
[1:47:45] is how God's data storage system is very
[1:47:48] good we can it's the amount of
[1:47:49] information is encoded into this thing
[1:47:52] called DNA
[1:47:53] or in the human being we have about 1.15
[1:47:55] grams of DNA or we can store about 6
[1:47:58] million films our data houses that much
[1:48:00] information at just a piece of data in
[1:48:02] US we're very complex beings right
[1:48:06] now
[1:48:08] when Adam was made
[1:48:11] he had an eternal image so the DNA that
[1:48:13] was made to create him that was made
[1:48:15] from the Earth
[1:48:16] the color and skin colors everything was
[1:48:18] made like what he was right
[1:48:22] okay
[1:48:23] this one here which we're going to call
[1:48:25] Strangers you had another
[1:48:27] you've got another line that comes from
[1:48:28] man being with woman and a child being
[1:48:31] born
[1:48:32] that is neither there
[1:48:35] it's not from there but he neither does
[1:48:38] he have representation or she have
[1:48:39] representation you've got this other
[1:48:41] this other being right you understand
[1:48:43] that just let's call this Abel
[1:48:45] right now God knew that in order to make
[1:48:49] me
[1:48:50] I'm going to be a mix of all sorts of
[1:48:51] things
[1:48:53] later on down the line I've got to get
[1:48:54] the DNA pattern has to be made over to
[1:48:58] four thousand seven thousand years to
[1:48:59] make me right yeah but it's got to be
[1:49:01] made somehow
[1:49:04] I want to talk about strangers for a
[1:49:05] little bit Thou shalt this is in the
[1:49:07] children of this race says Thou shalt
[1:49:08] neither Vex a stranger nor a person for
[1:49:10] You Were Strangers in the land of Egypt
[1:49:12] so God's saying you're you're part of me
[1:49:14] you're part of you're my children but if
[1:49:16] a stranger comes in and wants to be a
[1:49:18] part of it don't fix them let him come
[1:49:20] in right
[1:49:22] because I want to show you these people
[1:49:23] are strangers that can actually come and
[1:49:24] inherit the kingdom of God but they're
[1:49:26] not it's not their Kingdom but they have
[1:49:28] a right to inherit it that's why the
[1:49:29] Bible says whosoever we'll let him come
[1:49:31] because God had to somehow make Humanity
[1:49:35] to make us he's got
[1:49:37] salvation is for us but these people but
[1:49:40] these beings will get it if they want it
[1:49:42] they don't want it they don't have to
[1:49:43] have it but we'll go to strangers first
[1:49:45] and if a stranger is doing with thee in
[1:49:47] your land you shall not Vex him but the
[1:49:49] stranger that dwelleth with you you with
[1:49:51] you shall be unto you as one born among
[1:49:53] you and thou shalt love them as thyself
[1:49:55] For You Were Strangers in the land of
[1:49:56] Egypt
[1:49:57] now I want you to get this concept right
[1:50:00] because in the past there's been this
[1:50:02] thing about denominational Christians
[1:50:03] these sorts of things it's actually not
[1:50:05] right
[1:50:06] you the Bible say when you perceive see
[1:50:11] I don't want to preach too much because
[1:50:12] I want to keep going through it but if
[1:50:14] you've got representation from the other
[1:50:15] world you're going to receive the Holy
[1:50:17] Ghost you're going to understand the
[1:50:18] things from there if you don't have
[1:50:19] representation you're never going to
[1:50:21] understand it
[1:50:22] you're never going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:50:23] but you can accept salvation that's as
[1:50:26] far as you go because you're not from
[1:50:27] there you don't it's not in you yeah but
[1:50:30] because you're going to be born through
[1:50:31] Humanity these then you get the
[1:50:34] opportunity and you can choose either
[1:50:35] way right
[1:50:36] do you understand okay
[1:50:39] and whosoever but they come on the same
[1:50:41] Principle as as if they come in and
[1:50:43] whosoever there shall be of the House of
[1:50:45] Israel or of the strangers that's adjune
[1:50:46] among you that eateth any manner of
[1:50:48] blood I'll even set my face against that
[1:50:49] soul that Edith plate and will cut them
[1:50:51] off from his people so yes you can come
[1:50:53] in but you've got to follow the same
[1:50:54] rules so you don't follow the rules
[1:50:55] you're at you they don't just come and
[1:50:57] do what they want so that's but that's
[1:50:58] the way that it works right
[1:51:01] now Jesus is walking along the shores of
[1:51:03] Galilean it's walking around no he isn't
[1:51:06] I just put the picture of the um
[1:51:07] fish there for the children and John
[1:51:09] answered them saying master
[1:51:11] Jesus has has got his ministry and he
[1:51:13] said Master we saw one casting out there
[1:51:15] was in thy name and he followeth not us
[1:51:17] and we forbade him
[1:51:18] yeah because he followeth not us but
[1:51:20] Jesus said forbid him not
[1:51:22] for there is no man which can do a
[1:51:23] miracle in my name that can lightly
[1:51:25] speak evil of me
[1:51:27] for he that is not against us is on our
[1:51:29] part for whosoever shall give you a cup
[1:51:30] of water to drink in my name because you
[1:51:32] belong to Christ verily I sound to you
[1:51:33] who do not lose this reward now there's
[1:51:35] this this part of humanity
[1:51:37] as a purely uh they have pure free moral
[1:51:41] agency in terms that they get to decide
[1:51:42] the Eternal destination okay now their
[1:51:45] their being is made I've got it here
[1:51:46] soon here
[1:51:48] okay there being I'm gonna in order for
[1:51:51] me to get around my head to say well
[1:51:52] then where'd they come from what being
[1:51:53] was this they were made their being has
[1:51:55] made like what an angel would like an
[1:51:57] angel was created and could choose which
[1:51:58] path they took
[1:52:00] right then then one path stayed with God
[1:52:02] one went down and they became that but
[1:52:04] this other being didn't have a
[1:52:07] because Adam and Eve weren't supposed to
[1:52:09] be together so these were you could call
[1:52:11] them mistakes
[1:52:12] if you wanna but it's not a mistake but
[1:52:14] you created this being but but they
[1:52:16] didn't have any representation but so
[1:52:18] then God made it that they had a choice
[1:52:19] so they were I'm going to reference the
[1:52:21] being like what came in them to talk and
[1:52:24] be a person
[1:52:25] a name that sort of being not like their
[1:52:27] Angels but you understand what I mean
[1:52:28] there's a being that can be right so
[1:52:30] they could they then have pure choice
[1:52:32] and their outcome
[1:52:35] their outcome determines exactly on what
[1:52:37] they choose
[1:52:38] that's why if someone doesn't believe
[1:52:39] this don't just leave it you don't want
[1:52:42] to leave it just and say praise the Lord
[1:52:45] go on love the Lord
[1:52:47] if they do that they'll be in
[1:52:49] see this gospel the Salvation was for
[1:52:51] his children he came to us redeemed
[1:52:53] but because he knew there's going to be
[1:52:55] other people here not that but that you
[1:52:58] can be saved too if you want to come and
[1:52:59] come in and we'll show you where they
[1:53:00] end up at the end that's why these
[1:53:01] things like what Billy Graham didn't
[1:53:03] that's absolutely of the Lord even
[1:53:04] though at that time there was another
[1:53:05] message going forth to call out a bride
[1:53:07] but this is absolutely of the Lord to
[1:53:09] call to come come let them come not
[1:53:12] preaching the same thing because they're
[1:53:13] not going to receive the same thing
[1:53:15] right these ones even today there's that
[1:53:18] it's happening it's absolutely of the
[1:53:21] Lord but you've got to know what you're
[1:53:22] laboring in
[1:53:23] right we don't labor to say we labor for
[1:53:27] the people with representation that can
[1:53:28] receive the Holy Ghost because we
[1:53:30] understand you just accept that it's
[1:53:31] hard to describe but you just it's
[1:53:33] different okay
[1:53:35] now that's why I say salvation salvation
[1:53:39] Jesus came not at this world to redeem
[1:53:41] his children those for that
[1:53:42] representation that was what he came for
[1:53:44] but he said if anyone else wants to come
[1:53:46] in if you're strange you want to come in
[1:53:47] you can come in and this needs to decide
[1:53:51] which one they choose but don't forget
[1:53:52] Redemption was for you it was for the
[1:53:54] people with a representation
[1:53:56] that was purely why he came
[1:53:59] amen but then he said well this is why
[1:54:01] I used to feel funny about singing other
[1:54:03] people's songs you know that I think
[1:54:04] you're not really that's good you know
[1:54:07] but now I'm like actually no it wasn't
[1:54:08] for me wouldn't have that song
[1:54:10] you come in and you write it now if you
[1:54:12] go out I keep the song
[1:54:14] that song we sung I pledge allegiance to
[1:54:16] the lamb that man became homosexual now
[1:54:19] he's a practicing homosexual saying it's
[1:54:20] all good to be homosexual in the Church
[1:54:21] of God and he's promoting that okay we
[1:54:23] still sing it and we get anointed by you
[1:54:25] probably won't anymore because you'll
[1:54:26] think about that when you sing it a lot
[1:54:27] of churches won't sing it because I know
[1:54:29] we don't want to sing that it's he he
[1:54:30] was a homosexual I'm like yeah I like
[1:54:31] the song If he walks out I keep the song
[1:54:33] yeah
[1:54:34] because because you're only you only got
[1:54:36] it because you you tried to be a part
[1:54:38] you're a stranger in my land and I
[1:54:39] learned a few things off you if you
[1:54:40] leave that belongs to me that's why I
[1:54:42] think all the songs you're in spite of
[1:54:44] God but they actually all belong for me
[1:54:45] if I wasn't here you wouldn't have them
[1:54:46] you understand uh
[1:54:49] represent the Son of God with
[1:54:51] representation now here's just one thing
[1:54:52] that confused me a little bit because
[1:54:54] brother Branham said that Jesus blood
[1:54:57] the on the world and all the babies
[1:54:58] are saved okay
[1:55:00] if you die as a baby you're saved now
[1:55:02] that that was a little hard to get my
[1:55:03] head around because I'm thinking what
[1:55:04] about if you're born like that
[1:55:05] okay yeah okay now I came up with two
[1:55:09] things but I think that that
[1:55:13] I want to say the first one was when
[1:55:14] Kane went out
[1:55:16] he said oh if people find out what I've
[1:55:17] done they'll kill me and God put a mark
[1:55:19] on Cain and said no one's going to kill
[1:55:20] you
[1:55:21] so then I had this first my first idea
[1:55:22] was maybe maybe when they're born
[1:55:24] there's a mark and even say this this
[1:55:25] one if he's from that line he can't die
[1:55:27] till he's of the age to reject it right
[1:55:29] that that's plausible because Kane had
[1:55:31] that Mark that got a bit complex in my
[1:55:34] mind
[1:55:35] the word I got was show no mercy
[1:55:38] now
[1:55:40] I thought that and I thought there's a
[1:55:42] scripture for that and God went when he
[1:55:43] said to the children of Israel to go and
[1:55:45] land he said when you get there just
[1:55:46] kill everybody
[1:55:47] the the man the woman the children
[1:55:49] everybody and he said on the last line
[1:55:50] show no mercy right brother Mario comes
[1:55:53] up a couple days later and reads that
[1:55:55] scripture and then it's the same thing
[1:55:57] he says show no mercy now I don't like
[1:55:59] to show no mercy because that's not what
[1:56:00] I'm made of but I have to ask the
[1:56:02] question is God going to save all the
[1:56:03] animals that die
[1:56:04] no
[1:56:09] what are we dealing with I'm not saying
[1:56:12] an animal but I'm saying a hybrid he's
[1:56:13] like hey
[1:56:15] I made the wicked for the day of
[1:56:16] Destruction
[1:56:18] okay it's a hard thought that's why I
[1:56:20] couldn't get my head around I'm like
[1:56:21] this is very hard for me but Salvation
[1:56:23] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:56:25] his only begotten son whosoever believes
[1:56:26] now that's what I believe that's why
[1:56:28] I've mentioned no names it's whosoever
[1:56:29] believes come in you believe it come in
[1:56:32] it's all for you
[1:56:34] you believe it come in no matter what
[1:56:36] you are come in it's for you okay that's
[1:56:39] what I believe
[1:56:40] I have to see this because I have to
[1:56:42] understand this but this is what I
[1:56:43] believe it's whomsoever will in the last
[1:56:46] day the great day of the feast Jesus
[1:56:47] stood in quiet If any man thirsted him
[1:56:49] coming to me and drink he that believeth
[1:56:51] on me as the scripture saith has said
[1:56:52] out of as badly shall fly rivers of
[1:56:54] Living Water but this is spake of the
[1:56:55] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:56:57] should receive the Holy Ghost
[1:56:59] which they should receive for the Holy
[1:57:00] Ghost is not yet given because that
[1:57:01] Jesus will not yet glorified now if you
[1:57:04] if you're not part of the representation
[1:57:06] you can still receive that and you'll
[1:57:07] just think oh that spirit is just when
[1:57:09] the spirit comes but then for the
[1:57:10] Believers that so that's when the Holy
[1:57:12] Spirit comes in but if someone wants to
[1:57:14] receive it they can receive it you
[1:57:16] understand
[1:57:17] so being very very nice to everyone that
[1:57:19] wants to call upon the name of the Lord
[1:57:21] very nice
[1:57:23] the way you react to them could
[1:57:24] determine your outcome don't forget this
[1:57:27] is a hard saying to say but they're
[1:57:28] they're dispensable
[1:57:30] they have no representation
[1:57:32] you can never be lost some people can
[1:57:34] never be saved these ones are
[1:57:36] dispensable that's a hard hard word to
[1:57:38] say do you understand if you try and RAM
[1:57:41] something down their throat and they
[1:57:42] reject it you know it says and they say
[1:57:43] and they get so in the humanity rejected
[1:57:46] the Bible says the only unforgivable sin
[1:57:47] here and in the world to come is calling
[1:57:49] a genuine work of art and God an unclean
[1:57:52] thing it says you won't be forgiven here
[1:57:53] or the world to come you're out
[1:57:55] there are people that ended that are
[1:57:57] dispensable it's like well you're out
[1:57:59] that's it you hate your choice you chose
[1:58:01] that gone it's that simple so be very
[1:58:04] careful just encourage people if you
[1:58:06] find they're not interested encourage
[1:58:07] them in the Lord praise the Lord man get
[1:58:09] keep going believe the Lord believe this
[1:58:10] I'll see you there keep going bro
[1:58:14] be as nice as you can I mean that okay
[1:58:16] there's strangers in the land and God
[1:58:18] sees you shall love them as you love
[1:58:19] yourself
[1:58:20] love them as you love yourself they're
[1:58:22] not going to accept this but love them
[1:58:23] because they they'll make it if they
[1:58:25] believe they'll make it because it's for
[1:58:27] whomsoever will
[1:58:28] yes okay now I need to go now to the
[1:58:30] Book of Life and then
[1:58:32] I'm right on time
[1:58:34] The Book of Life now we've got three
[1:58:37] clearly three things in the Book of Life
[1:58:39] one group that's never on the book
[1:58:41] one group that their actions determine
[1:58:43] whether they're on or off and one group
[1:58:45] that always on never come off okay
[1:58:47] now let's look at always on the book
[1:58:49] first of all we know most assuredly that
[1:58:52] the purpose of God stands in election it
[1:58:53] was purpose in himself it was God's
[1:58:55] purpose to bring forth to people like
[1:58:56] unto himself that would be a word bride
[1:58:58] she was chosen in him before the
[1:59:00] foundation of the world in him she was
[1:59:02] foreknown and beloved before she was
[1:59:04] ever brought forth during the ages upon
[1:59:05] the Earth before we got here where
[1:59:06] representation he was Redeemed by his
[1:59:08] blood and can never come into
[1:59:09] condemnation she can never be in the
[1:59:11] Judgment because she because sin cannot
[1:59:13] be imputed unto Romans 4 8 says blessed
[1:59:15] is the man to whom the Lord does not
[1:59:17] impute sin okay but indeed she shall be
[1:59:20] with them in his throne of judgment
[1:59:22] judging the world even and even angels
[1:59:24] her name each of whom members All of You
[1:59:26] was written in a section of the Lamb's
[1:59:28] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:59:29] the world and can never be taken off
[1:59:31] okay
[1:59:33] but you made a choice already
[1:59:35] you've made your choice that's why when
[1:59:36] you cut here you're just manifesting
[1:59:37] your choice you can never be taken off
[1:59:40] now the next one the less got another
[1:59:42] step further but before we do let's
[1:59:43] review our case that's far first of all
[1:59:44] we know most assuredly that the purpose
[1:59:47] of God secondly there is another class
[1:59:48] their names were also on the book of
[1:59:50] life and they will come up in the second
[1:59:52] Resurrection such as other foolish
[1:59:53] virgins and the righteous as it spoken
[1:59:55] of Matthew 25 and this class also are
[1:59:58] those who do not worship the Beast or
[1:59:59] become involved in the Antichrist system
[2:00:00] but die for their faith even though they
[2:00:02] are not in the bride not having been
[2:00:04] born again but they will come up when
[2:00:06] the second resurrection and go into
[2:00:07] eternal life
[2:00:08] okay because they are a byproduct of
[2:00:11] what Humanity wasn't supposed to do but
[2:00:13] they did and these people came forth to
[2:00:15] bring forth me there's got to be
[2:00:16] opportunity right but it's not the bride
[2:00:18] because there are different we've got to
[2:00:19] end up in threes right
[2:00:21] now Judas or the third one thirdly there
[2:00:24] are the borderline Christians such as we
[2:00:25] saw in Israel coming out of Egypt these
[2:00:27] had their names I'm still in the middle
[2:00:28] one by the way these had their names
[2:00:31] on the book of life and the works
[2:00:33] written in the books these having failed
[2:00:35] to obey God and being void of the spirit
[2:00:37] even though the signs and wonders were
[2:00:38] amongst them will never have their names
[2:00:40] will have their names removed from the
[2:00:42] book amongst this group will be the ones
[2:00:44] like Judas who though entirely void of
[2:00:47] the spirit but are religious will have
[2:00:49] manifestations in their lives
[2:00:51] and though on the books were not elected
[2:00:53] in him such as as Balaam such also as
[2:00:55] Balaam will be in that group okay
[2:00:57] so now I want to talk about Judas for a
[2:00:59] minute Judas was from that line he
[2:01:01] wasn't from Satan he was this right now
[2:01:03] the disciples got together after Judas
[2:01:06] had betrayed Jesus they got together and
[2:01:07] they said in the 70 returned even with
[2:01:09] joy I know this is before that they said
[2:01:11] uh Lord even the devils are subject unto
[2:01:14] us and he said unto them I beheld Satan
[2:01:16] is lightning falling from Heaven behold
[2:01:17] I give unto you power to tread on
[2:01:19] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[2:01:20] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[2:01:22] any means hurt you notwithstanding in
[2:01:24] this rejoice
[2:01:25] not that the spirits are subject to you
[2:01:27] but Rejoice because your name is written
[2:01:29] in heaven okay now now we know that
[2:01:31] Judas was among them he said Your name's
[2:01:33] written in heaven so at that point Judas
[2:01:34] had his name written in heaven and he
[2:01:35] was on his way to Glory yeah okay
[2:01:37] clearly
[2:01:38] now after it all happened and unfolded
[2:01:40] the way that it did because Judas made a
[2:01:41] choice now I don't want to I want to go
[2:01:43] this way right
[2:01:45] and in those days Peter stood up in the
[2:01:47] midst of the disciples and said
[2:01:49] um the number of the names together were
[2:01:51] about 120 men and Brethren the scripture
[2:01:53] must needs have been fulfilled with the
[2:01:54] Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake
[2:01:55] concerning Judas which was guide to them
[2:01:57] that took Jesus for he was numbered with
[2:01:59] us and obtained part of the ministry now
[2:02:00] this man purchased a field with the
[2:02:02] reward of his iniquity and falling head
[2:02:04] long he bursted Thunder in the midst and
[2:02:05] all his bowels gusts out committed
[2:02:06] suicide and it was known amongst all the
[2:02:08] Dwellers at Jerusalem until the Dwellers
[2:02:10] at Jerusalem and so much that the field
[2:02:12] is called in the proper tongue
[2:02:13] which is to say the field of budford is
[2:02:16] written in the Book of Psalms let us
[2:02:17] habitation be desolate and let no man
[2:02:19] dwell Theron and his Bishop Rock let
[2:02:21] another man take so they're looking back
[2:02:23] in the Old Testament saying this is
[2:02:24] where it talks about Judas let his land
[2:02:26] be desolate and let someone else take
[2:02:28] his position
[2:02:30] don't think that God's not in the Small
[2:02:31] Things these men are up in a small room
[2:02:33] saying uh David wrote about us
[2:02:37] 120 guys in a room saying David wrote
[2:02:39] about us
[2:02:40] now let's go back to that one
[2:02:42] Psalms 109 verse 8 says let his days be
[2:02:45] few and then another taker's office
[2:02:46] they're saying that meant Judas
[2:02:48] and then they're saying this one let the
[2:02:50] habitation be desolate and let none
[2:02:52] dwell in their tents for they persecute
[2:02:54] him whom now has smitten and they talked
[2:02:55] to the grief of Those whom thou has
[2:02:57] wounded and inequity and to add inequity
[2:03:00] unto their inequity and let not them
[2:03:01] come and unto the righteous let them be
[2:03:04] blotted out of the book of the living
[2:03:05] and not be written with the righteous
[2:03:08] so saying let his name be blotted out
[2:03:10] okay so he was on there then he was off
[2:03:12] by his choice right
[2:03:14] okay now now that you have this other
[2:03:16] group fourth and finally which come from
[2:03:18] this origin that made a choice fourth
[2:03:19] and finally are the ones whose names
[2:03:21] have never been or ever will be written
[2:03:23] on the books such as the found in
[2:03:24] Revelation 38 and Revelation 17 8 and
[2:03:27] all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[2:03:29] worship Him whose names are not written
[2:03:30] in the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[2:03:32] from the foundation of the world
[2:03:34] not there
[2:03:36] the basic their saurus was and it's not
[2:03:38] and shall I seen out of the bottomless
[2:03:39] pit and go into petition and they that
[2:03:41] dwell on the Earth shall Wonder those
[2:03:42] whose names were not written in the Book
[2:03:43] of Life from the foundation of the world
[2:03:45] when they behold the Beast that was and
[2:03:46] is and yet as Jesus said that a certain
[2:03:48] group would have seek one who comes in
[2:03:50] their own name that is that one is the
[2:03:52] Antichrist and that is exactly what it
[2:03:53] says of them in Revelation 38 and 17 8.
[2:03:56] these were ordained of God but not unto
[2:03:58] election and what's what this group was
[2:04:00] such as Pharaoh it says if I'm even for
[2:04:02] the same purpose have I raise the up
[2:04:04] vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction
[2:04:06] Romans 9 17 and 22 says None of these
[2:04:09] would be placed on the records of life
[2:04:11] I'm not saying there is no record of
[2:04:12] them no doubt there is some kind of
[2:04:14] record of them but not on the records of
[2:04:16] Life their purpose of existence has to
[2:04:17] be dealt with slightly in the rest of
[2:04:19] this book but we can add two more
[2:04:20] scriptures Proverbs 16 4 that says the
[2:04:22] Lord hath made the wicked for the day of
[2:04:24] evil and the wicked is reserved to the
[2:04:27] day of Destruction they shall be brought
[2:04:29] forth in the day of Wrath
[2:04:31] okay yeah okay
[2:04:37] this has been hard for my head but it
[2:04:39] makes things make sense
[2:04:40] now I want to tell you this this was our
[2:04:42] journey I'm about to close
[2:04:44] okay this was our journey
[2:04:47] we started off here with the glory when
[2:04:49] we were made in His image
[2:04:51] I had a glorified body and I had a I had
[2:04:54] some sort of mind but I don't know what
[2:04:55] minor hex I can't remember right
[2:04:58] I'm not going to say I don't know
[2:05:00] neither do you
[2:05:01] now it's always got to end up in three I
[2:05:03] came to the Earth there was a physical
[2:05:05] body made for me that that's part of me
[2:05:07] here whatever it was I don't know what
[2:05:09] it was but some some part of me stated
[2:05:10] some part of me came here because that
[2:05:12] part of me is waiting when this earthy
[2:05:13] tabernacle's dissolved I've got one
[2:05:15] waiting I'm gonna go back there and it
[2:05:16] looks like me so I got made on this
[2:05:18] Earth DNA matched me exactly and I turn
[2:05:20] up here and I and then I I become a soul
[2:05:22] a body and a spirit because I there's a
[2:05:24] human Spirit upon this Earth that we get
[2:05:25] as a human
[2:05:27] and I've got my soul which was from
[2:05:28] there and then over time I received the
[2:05:30] Holy Ghost because that's my that's the
[2:05:32] earnest of my inheritance that I've got
[2:05:34] a representation there it's the only
[2:05:36] people that receive the Holy Ghost the
[2:05:37] ones that have representation there
[2:05:38] people can receive salvation not the
[2:05:40] Holy Ghost because that's that's
[2:05:41] essentially part of me coming in because
[2:05:42] that's from that's from that world
[2:05:44] coming in right
[2:05:45] so I have these I end up being a full
[2:05:47] human being right before it's an unusual
[2:05:50] number but when I pass on
[2:05:53] my body
[2:05:54] dies this is the surf this body just
[2:05:57] goes back to the Earth my Earthly Spirit
[2:05:59] just ceases to be because it was just
[2:06:01] came with this empty Spirit what things
[2:06:03] go on my soul which is which is me there
[2:06:05] but knowing all this now and the whole
[2:06:08] the holy ghost that the promise of me
[2:06:10] goes on and it joins up with my
[2:06:11] glorified body that's there and I become
[2:06:13] a Triune being the way I should be I've
[2:06:15] got a body I've got a human soul to know
[2:06:17] this
[2:06:18] and I've got God
[2:06:20] in me I've got this right so I become
[2:06:23] who I should be but I've gone on this
[2:06:25] long journey it's our view okay let your
[2:06:27] journey we're gone
[2:06:28] the wedding garment is the Holy Ghost
[2:06:30] yes okay so this that's why this Parable
[2:06:33] here says someone tried to come in
[2:06:34] without the wedding garment only those
[2:06:37] that are going to the marriage supper of
[2:06:38] the Lamb only those with the Holy Ghost
[2:06:40] to go in there
[2:06:42] but we've got to have we get a I need
[2:06:44] this is the big thing I want you to get
[2:06:46] out of this we get a winning garment
[2:06:48] because we've got a body to put it on
[2:06:50] right
[2:06:51] you can't put a wedding garment on on a
[2:06:53] spirit without a body
[2:06:55] right so it's only those that have a
[2:06:57] body because when I go I it's like I
[2:06:59] carry it the Holy Ghost then when I get
[2:07:00] there I put it on my my body
[2:07:02] the only people with the body put it on
[2:07:04] right so if you don't have a body there
[2:07:06] you don't get the Holy Ghost now you get
[2:07:08] one eventually I want to show you where
[2:07:09] they fit in but the marriage supper of
[2:07:11] lamb I haven't actually talks about I
[2:07:12] haven't gone into this very much so I
[2:07:13] can't really say much all I can say is
[2:07:16] first there's a wedding supper as this
[2:07:18] is the Tribulation is happening on the
[2:07:20] earth and then we're going to rain with
[2:07:21] them for a thousand years on this Earth
[2:07:23] as it is now but Satan's going to be
[2:07:25] bound a thousand years and now people
[2:07:27] say uh are they going to be babies born
[2:07:29] I don't believe there will be because
[2:07:31] the time will actually slow down I don't
[2:07:33] think time is going to transpire that
[2:07:35] people will actually like babies cannot
[2:07:36] be growing you know that time will just
[2:07:40] it's like you'll be there for a thousand
[2:07:41] years because it's like an old man shall
[2:07:42] be as as this
[2:07:44] and a young man you would just stay so
[2:07:45] some way or another time we'll just stop
[2:07:47] saying how can you things aren't going
[2:07:48] to grow like and produce on the linear
[2:07:52] space of time that's just what I think
[2:07:54] because it wouldn't make sense for
[2:07:55] babies to be born in this 2000 years but
[2:07:57] it's like
[2:07:58] maybe it's a day of risk maybe maybe
[2:07:59] that's the seventh day because it's the
[2:08:01] seventh day maybe God just rests time
[2:08:02] we're gonna rest for a thousand years
[2:08:03] because that's what it is the Earth has
[2:08:04] been six thousand years seventh day
[2:08:06] we're gonna rest stop time relax
[2:08:09] when it starts again in this then
[2:08:11] there's the the final Earth is destroyed
[2:08:13] after that after the thousand years is
[2:08:14] up the day of rest the Earth is
[2:08:16] destroyed we all turn up I'm about to
[2:08:18] close we all turn up to this place
[2:08:19] called the Great White Throne judgment
[2:08:21] now the Bible says know you're not that
[2:08:23] the Saints will judge the Earth Okay so
[2:08:25] we've turned up there and we've got a
[2:08:27] body
[2:08:27] right now we judge the Earth okay
[2:08:30] now before us before us
[2:08:34] there are humans are put and and angels
[2:08:37] are going to put before us and they come
[2:08:38] from two places firstly it says death
[2:08:41] and hella gave up the dead that were in
[2:08:42] them okay there are people that are
[2:08:45] going to judgment just to confirm you're
[2:08:47] going back there yeah
[2:08:49] that's why they're there
[2:08:50] right there are people already there
[2:08:52] yeah now they say well hang on why can
[2:08:54] you go to a judgment
[2:08:56] to be judged and you're already you've
[2:08:58] been convicted of the crime
[2:09:00] I believe the people that are there are
[2:09:02] that and also the ones that blaspheme
[2:09:03] the Holy Ghost
[2:09:04] because that says there's no forgiveness
[2:09:06] here or the world to come so they they
[2:09:08] cut themselves off there everyone else I
[2:09:10] believe
[2:09:11] if they're not part of that line they
[2:09:13] then they and then the next in the same
[2:09:14] scripture it says the sea gave up they
[2:09:16] did there's another group that had put
[2:09:18] forth
[2:09:19] right which is not from death and hell
[2:09:21] but they're not judging
[2:09:23] now these these beings end up to be
[2:09:25] Spirits without bodies
[2:09:27] okay
[2:09:29] when this being dies his body dies
[2:09:33] his Spirit human Spirit dies it's just a
[2:09:36] soul what it looks like I'm not sure
[2:09:38] but it's it's a soul without a body
[2:09:40] because it doesn't have a body weighting
[2:09:42] yeah right so it's turning up to the
[2:09:45] Judgment without a body
[2:09:46] a spirit without a body it's naked
[2:09:50] right
[2:09:53] now
[2:09:55] this is why we can say there is
[2:09:57] potential forgiveness there because this
[2:09:58] scripture says and whosoever speaketh
[2:10:00] the word against the son of man it shall
[2:10:02] be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh
[2:10:04] against the Holy Ghost it shall not be
[2:10:06] forgiven him neither in this world nor
[2:10:08] in the world to come right so now you
[2:10:11] could color that in and say okay that
[2:10:12] tells me that that in the world to come
[2:10:14] there is forgiveness available
[2:10:16] right because if you say there's no
[2:10:18] forgiveness here because he could say uh
[2:10:20] you won't be forgiven here but in the
[2:10:21] world to come you be forgiven
[2:10:23] now that's possible
[2:10:25] right it's possible for The Unforgiven
[2:10:28] to go there and be forgiven there
[2:10:29] there's forgiveness there absolutely and
[2:10:31] that's that's why it's a judgment come
[2:10:33] forth what did you do
[2:10:35] and it's a fear judgment some people
[2:10:37] never heard the gospel never heard the
[2:10:39] gospel never heard nothing
[2:10:40] better Sophia judgment what did you do
[2:10:42] with your life then like I say this one
[2:10:45] for he that is not against us as for us
[2:10:46] is on our part whosoever should give you
[2:10:48] a cup of water to drink in my name
[2:10:49] because you belong to Christ really
[2:10:50] sound to you he shall not lose his
[2:10:52] reward
[2:10:53] see one of these people could just say
[2:10:55] man I like you want a v give David a v
[2:10:58] now on the day of judgment that's going
[2:11:00] to come up oh yeah he was nice he gave
[2:11:01] him a v
[2:11:03] never heard the gospel never did nothing
[2:11:05] that could be it what does it say
[2:11:07] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[2:11:08] obtain Mercy there may be people that
[2:11:10] didn't know nothing but in their heart
[2:11:11] they were merciful
[2:11:12] never heard the gospel and they just did
[2:11:14] acts of Mercy help people did that
[2:11:16] they're going to be judged accordingly
[2:11:17] because don't forget that the judge is
[2:11:19] there Christ blood has been shed for
[2:11:20] everyone
[2:11:21] okay
[2:11:23] the the there is going to be
[2:11:25] there uh blessed are the peacemakers
[2:11:29] there are good people in the world that
[2:11:31] are just doing good things I believe on
[2:11:33] the day of judgment that will be
[2:11:34] remembered
[2:11:35] so don't just write everything off
[2:11:36] except just to let God be God to worry
[2:11:39] about you let God be God and if people
[2:11:41] bless you I encourage you to say Thank
[2:11:42] you Lord I thank you for that person
[2:11:43] blessing me I've done it many times if a
[2:11:45] family member that I know not interested
[2:11:46] in God does something nice for me I say
[2:11:48] Lord I remember that if they never do
[2:11:50] nothing in this on a bad judgment I'm
[2:11:52] going to say I remember that yeah if
[2:11:54] people do if people some people wave out
[2:11:56] to me some people lift a box of fruit
[2:11:57] and I went and got a piece out of there
[2:11:59] and I said and something in me said I
[2:12:01] said Lord whoever gave me this fruit
[2:12:02] thank you they they put a box of fruit
[2:12:04] on the side of the road said free and I
[2:12:06] was running past and I was hungry well
[2:12:08] it's a bit of fruit free I'll eat it and
[2:12:10] I enjoyed it I said Lord have a gate put
[2:12:12] that fruit there on the day of judgment
[2:12:14] I'm going to remember them when they
[2:12:15] come up show me who it was I enjoyed
[2:12:17] this
[2:12:20] this is the power of forgiveness right
[2:12:22] because God's got a lot of people on the
[2:12:24] new heavens and new earth right
[2:12:25] amen
[2:12:27] but you have one last issue to sort of
[2:12:30] deal with right we are there we've got a
[2:12:32] soul we've got our body that was made
[2:12:34] these people are there let's say they
[2:12:35] come there and then they believe in the
[2:12:37] Lord yes he clearly believes the Lord
[2:12:39] with all of his heart he believes the
[2:12:40] Lord there's that those people that
[2:12:41] believe there's other people that did
[2:12:43] things there's a whole group of people
[2:12:44] that are going to be saved
[2:12:46] I've heard people that you wouldn't
[2:12:47] think will be Christians dying and
[2:12:49] saying they came back they said man I
[2:12:50] was walking along this field not even a
[2:12:51] Christian I was going somewhere
[2:12:54] there's something in all this right it's
[2:12:55] bigger than what we think don't just
[2:12:57] Heaven is going to be a big place with a
[2:12:59] lot of people
[2:13:00] more people than what I hear now
[2:13:02] billions this Earth has only got 30
[2:13:04] percent
[2:13:05] Earth and we managed to fit here
[2:13:07] comfortably and half the planet is
[2:13:09] inhabitable
[2:13:11] there's going to be a whole planet with
[2:13:12] no sea there's going to be billions and
[2:13:14] billions of people mark my words it's
[2:13:15] going to be a massive world it's this
[2:13:17] place here it can be a lot of people not
[2:13:19] just us four and no more people there's
[2:13:21] a lot of people there right
[2:13:24] last obstacle then is a spirit without a
[2:13:26] body so this person comes up if they get
[2:13:27] forgiveness they need a body this is now
[2:13:30] according to Isaac they need to first
[2:13:32] they need a body to put the robe on
[2:13:34] because God's got the robe and I just
[2:13:36] think how he does this see I think he
[2:13:37] just goes back to the Earth before and
[2:13:39] because it's been all baptized with fire
[2:13:41] and it gets there oh you mate where was
[2:13:43] you where are you gets them now don't
[2:13:46] forget Adam will live forever
[2:13:47] when he was there from that dirt he
[2:13:49] would live forever and ever
[2:13:50] this is just my idea of it right so he
[2:13:52] says right get his body we get her body
[2:13:54] fetch it back and there's a whether this
[2:13:57] is right or wrong I don't know but they
[2:13:58] but their body is not God just can't
[2:14:00] I'll quickly have another son and I'll
[2:14:02] merge you with the son or daughter
[2:14:04] you understand so that's this is the way
[2:14:06] I've made it they he just gets that body
[2:14:08] he gets their body back oh it's me again
[2:14:11] because remember they were just made
[2:14:12] from the Earth but it's been the the
[2:14:14] Earth has been baptized has been
[2:14:16] baptized Bloodshed and baptism of fire
[2:14:20] so it's all clean get his body make it
[2:14:22] so then he gets the body then the Holy
[2:14:23] Ghost is actually just the Holy Ghost
[2:14:25] given to him they get a robe to put on
[2:14:26] now they're walking around there
[2:14:28] but they're with you but they're not
[2:14:30] like you
[2:14:31] their body is not the same body as yours
[2:14:33] but they're there they've got the robot
[2:14:34] they're walking around happy
[2:14:35] but they're different and that's the way
[2:14:37] this new heavens and a new Earth right
[2:14:39] and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth
[2:14:41] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[2:14:42] will pass away and there was no more sea
[2:14:45] okay
[2:14:46] I bet there was water and I John saw the
[2:14:48] holy city New Jerusalem coming down out
[2:14:50] of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[2:14:52] for her husband
[2:14:56] I've got about three more to go
[2:15:01] now this there's this new heaven in the
[2:15:03] new Earth remember at the start I said
[2:15:04] what is not there is the is the holy
[2:15:06] city so on this one
[2:15:09] he said
[2:15:10] and there came unto me one of the Seven
[2:15:12] Angels which had the seven vials of the
[2:15:13] seven plagues and talks to me saying
[2:15:15] come hither and I'll show you the bride
[2:15:17] the Lamb's wife and he carried me away
[2:15:18] in the spirit to Great high mountain and
[2:15:21] showed me that great City the holy
[2:15:23] Jerusalem descending from God out of
[2:15:25] heaven
[2:15:26] that wasn't there at the beginning it
[2:15:28] says holy city
[2:15:29] the New Jerusalem where the bride the
[2:15:31] the the ones with the bodies
[2:15:34] that's where they're going to live
[2:15:35] the New Jerusalem the holy city
[2:15:37] now it says about this place
[2:15:40] neither shall there there shall be no
[2:15:42] night there and they need no candle
[2:15:45] neither light of the Sun for the Lord
[2:15:47] God giveth them light and shall reign
[2:15:49] forever and ever
[2:15:51] amen okay so God is there in this city
[2:15:53] and his light just lights all up the
[2:15:55] whole time and the city had no need of
[2:15:57] the sun neither of the moon to shine on
[2:15:59] it
[2:16:00] for the glory of God's Enlighten it and
[2:16:02] the lamb is the light thereof
[2:16:04] amen okay now this is the bride now the
[2:16:06] bride are the ones that have that were
[2:16:08] there in the beginning before the world
[2:16:09] was made and throughout all of the ages
[2:16:11] they'd be manifested they've heard his
[2:16:12] word they've come and through all the
[2:16:14] ages
[2:16:14] yes they live here this is a big place
[2:16:16] the city's a big city but it doesn't
[2:16:18] cover the whole Earth
[2:16:20] but this earth looks like this Earth
[2:16:23] just a whole lot better
[2:16:24] yes right but it's the same as this now
[2:16:26] you get another group and it says and
[2:16:29] the nations of them which are saved
[2:16:31] shall walk in the light of it so let's
[2:16:33] talk about this there's going to be
[2:16:34] Nations around that that it's almost
[2:16:36] like a reward system if you actually
[2:16:39] followed the Lord on the earth and you
[2:16:40] accepted it you're going to get to live
[2:16:42] close to the city and live in the light
[2:16:43] of it right it's a big place there are
[2:16:45] these people there are nations we're
[2:16:47] talking Nations millions billions and
[2:16:50] then it says and then the kings of the
[2:16:52] Earth all around the rest of the world
[2:16:53] there are Kings of the earth not nations
[2:16:56] of the safe just people maybe they've
[2:16:57] just did well on the earth and they've
[2:16:58] been in because of that whatever they're
[2:17:00] in for the kings of the earth do bring
[2:17:02] their glory and unto it and the gates of
[2:17:04] it shall not be shut At All by day and
[2:17:06] there shall be no night there and they
[2:17:08] shall bring the glory and honor of the
[2:17:09] Nations unto it okay
[2:17:12] there's going to be a lot of people
[2:17:13] there and it's going to be these groups
[2:17:14] one group near and these ones are going
[2:17:16] to be out there yeah there's going to be
[2:17:18] day and night out there
[2:17:20] because it says there's planets in that
[2:17:22] but it's not going to be night like
[2:17:23] Darkness because night is quite a
[2:17:25] wonderful thing
[2:17:26] when you can stop and relax and
[2:17:28] you go back to your homes and you relax
[2:17:30] that's what God intended hey just you go
[2:17:32] back don't just be all go go go go go
[2:17:33] home relax
[2:17:35] settle then in the morning when the Sun
[2:17:38] rises come back up the sun's going to
[2:17:39] rise if there was no no we might go for
[2:17:42] a walk out I want to go out and see what
[2:17:43] it's like to see the sunrise we've got
[2:17:44] to walk a long way to get out of the
[2:17:45] light of the city and we can see the
[2:17:47] sunrise
[2:17:48] right right but those in the city
[2:17:50] there's never any light now if you're on
[2:17:51] a globe you could be here that light
[2:17:53] lights that City it says there's no
[2:17:55] night there but there's planets and
[2:17:56] things happening there's light and
[2:17:58] darkness and that
[2:17:59] but the the people in existence are all
[2:18:02] the saved of the Lord
[2:18:04] the whole earth and there's going to be
[2:18:05] many many there's about eight billion
[2:18:07] people here I reckon is going to be
[2:18:09] probably
[2:18:11] 130 billion hundred I don't know there's
[2:18:12] gonna be a lot of people there there's
[2:18:14] kingdoms and Nations that come in and
[2:18:15] bring their Glory unto the city
[2:18:17] right but there's going to be different
[2:18:20] people some are in there some are there
[2:18:22] some are out there
[2:18:24] it's God's great plan of how he made it
[2:18:27] but amongst it all he says I am Alpha
[2:18:29] and Amiga I'm the beginning I'm the end
[2:18:32] I'm the first and the last this is who's
[2:18:33] going to be there lighting up the city
[2:18:35] and that's who we're going to dwell with
[2:18:36] the bride is going to dwell with other
[2:18:38] kings and that we'll get to enjoy and
[2:18:39] say hey and meet the king just like the
[2:18:41] Queen of Sheba did come in and out and
[2:18:43] bring things and then we want to go and
[2:18:44] see the king but the bride dwells with
[2:18:46] the King
[2:18:47] and and the new Heaven and the new Earth
[2:18:50] thank you very much for your time and
[2:18:53] for listening
[2:18:55] I I I wanted to get that thought off my
[2:18:57] mind so thank you for
[2:18:59] if you don't believe all of it
[2:19:04] praise the Lord
[2:19:06] just
[2:19:07] but if you want to ask me questions come
[2:19:09] and ask me I've got a whole bunch of
[2:19:10] stuff I left out okay and I've got
[2:19:11] reasons why I've said everything but
[2:19:13] hopefully what I want you to get out of
[2:19:15] it is be a good belief be and be nice to
[2:19:17] everybody
[2:19:18] yeah be nice to everyone as much as you
[2:19:20] can
[2:19:21] and just know that you're not from here
[2:19:23] it starts here it ends here all the
[2:19:26] stuff here doesn't matter don't get
[2:19:27] caught up in little finicky nonsense
[2:19:28] don't worry about it just keep your eyes
[2:19:30] on the Lord rejoice in the Lord
[2:19:32] don't worry about anything just praise
[2:19:34] the lord it's all falling apart praise
[2:19:36] the lord it's all going well praise the
[2:19:37] Lord
[2:19:39] you're not from here don't worry about
[2:19:40] it the Lord You're just here to you're
[2:19:43] here to go through things to be molded
[2:19:44] to be made to that's what I didn't
[2:19:46] really touch on but the purpose of you
[2:19:48] being here you think why does this whole
[2:19:49] thing in my last final Point why this
[2:19:52] whole thing why the trouble
[2:19:54] why the trouble that's what I thought
[2:19:57] when I started seeing it all like my
[2:19:59] first question not to the Lord but my
[2:20:00] first thought was why all this trouble
[2:20:02] it seems like a lot of
[2:20:04] why
[2:20:06] I'll tell you why so that you can
[2:20:07] experience God as my savior
[2:20:11] he's my healer
[2:20:13] He's My Redeemer back there he wasn't
[2:20:15] that because he didn't have a way of
[2:20:16] expressing it we come here into this
[2:20:18] realm that we can experience actually be
[2:20:19] lost now I'm saved
[2:20:22] I'm saved I'm redeemed we get sick we
[2:20:25] can be healed he's a Healer we get broke
[2:20:28] we ask the Lord help me he's a provider
[2:20:31] he becomes all these things to us that's
[2:20:33] the purpose of this whole thing just
[2:20:34] experience that if you're in a valley
[2:20:36] praise God no walk through the valley of
[2:20:38] the shadow of death I'll fear no evil
[2:20:40] for thou art with me they'll write that
[2:20:42] stuff that comfort me experience that
[2:20:44] that's what you're here for
[2:20:46] you just to understand the power and the
[2:20:48] goodness of God to know I'm a savior and
[2:20:50] King
[2:20:52] that's the most important part of the
[2:20:54] whole sermon actually right there I'm
[2:20:55] glad I remembered it praise the Lord
[2:20:57] have have you all got you can stand up
[2:21:01] Shake around a bit
[2:21:03] have you do you have 10 more minutes for
[2:21:05] me to sing this song okay you can I know
[2:21:09] I went a bit longer and I cut out 20
[2:21:11] slides I think to get there
[2:21:14] but um
[2:21:15] okay
[2:21:17] can you bring the words up for that song
[2:21:19] this is why I you understand why I wrote
[2:21:22] this song because it kind of like I just
[2:21:23] had this thought in my mind can you
[2:21:25] bring it up there
[2:21:26] the um
[2:21:31] as I'm thinking about this these the
[2:21:34] thoughts are coming to me and that's why
[2:21:35] I said before the world began you knew
[2:21:37] my name you helped me in your hand when
[2:21:39] the Earth was silent I was there with
[2:21:41] you singing your praise next one
[2:21:43] then I came to the Earth and I took my
[2:21:45] first breath and the cry that I made was
[2:21:47] singing your praise
[2:21:48] next one can you set the mics up while
[2:21:50] we're doing this
[2:21:51] yeah I have a reason to worship I have a
[2:21:54] reason to praise you I have a reason to
[2:21:55] lift up my hands and rejoice I have a
[2:21:57] reason to sing next one
[2:21:59] when I was lost in the darkness you came
[2:22:02] to find me I heard you calling my name
[2:22:03] took my sin and my shame and you saved
[2:22:05] me
[2:22:06] next one now I can call you my savior
