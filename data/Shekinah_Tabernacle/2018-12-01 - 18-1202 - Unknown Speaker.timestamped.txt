[4:01] this morning but the law doesn't look at
[4:04] the size of a tent that we worship him
[4:05] in a man who looks at the size of the
[4:07] praise in your heart this morning a man
[4:09] and with that in mind let's all stand
[4:11] and let's sing the song of praise to him
[4:14] and I want us to sing the song as a
[4:15] prayer just enter in forget about the
[4:19] person next to you

[4:22] situation wherever you may be

[8:21] morning thank you Jesus thank you Father
[8:25] Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah
[8:27] amen well let's go to the word this
[8:31] morning if you have your sword with you
[8:33] let's go to Psalms 51 what start from
[8:39] verse 6 it is also a very prayerful
[8:44] scripture that David wrote and David was
[8:48] I can imagine David was deep into the
[8:51] spirit as it put pen to paper and
[8:55] usually when we go so far deep into the
[8:56] presence of the Lord or into that
[8:58] dimension we begin to speak to him in a
[9:02] very prayerful manner everything we do
[9:05] is to his worship alone we begin to
[9:09] outdoor him we begin to praise his name
[9:11] even an hour in our darkest moment and I
[9:14] also Brides this moment which reminds us
[9:16] that we are built to worship so David
[9:21] says here behold thou desirest
[9:25] thou desireth truth in the inward parts
[9:27] and in the hidden parts thou shalt make
[9:30] me no wisdom purge me with hyssop and I
[9:35] shall be clean wash me and I shall be
[9:38] whiter than snow make me hear joy and
[9:41] gladness that the bones which thou has
[9:45] broken may rejoice hide thy face from my
[9:49] sins O Lord and blot out all mine
[9:52] iniquities Lord created me a clean heart
[9:56] O God and renew a right spirit within me
[10:00] cast me not away from thy presence and
[10:02] take not thy Holy Spirit from me Lord
[10:06] restore unto me the joy of our salvation
[10:08] and uphold me with thy free spirits then
[10:12] will I teach transgressors transgressors
[10:15] thy ways and sinners shall be converted
[10:17] unto thee deliver me from
[10:20] Bloodless from blood-guiltiness from
[10:25] blood glitchless or GERD that thou God
[10:28] my salvation and my tongue shall sing
[10:32] aloud of thy righteousness o Lord opened
[10:35] I'm open down my lips and my mouth shall
[10:39] shew forth thy praise for thou desire is
[10:42] as Osiris not sacrifice else would I
[10:45] give it's vowel the light says not in
[10:48] burnt offering the sacrifices of God are
[10:51] a broken spirit a broken and contrite
[10:55] hearts contrite and that might have mean
[10:58] their repentance our hearts of
[11:00] repentance are knowing that we have done
[11:02] wrong that Willborn limited amen

[11:09] sacrifices of God are a broken spirit a
[11:11] broken and contrite heart O God thou

[11:18] prayer this morning for when he sees
[11:20] your heart full of spirit there's no way
[11:21] he can despise you

[11:23] which means you've already found favor

[45:50] your calling and election sure for if
[45:52] you do these things you shall never fall
[45:53] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[45:56] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[45:58] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[46:00] Christ where for I will not be negligent
[46:02] to put you're always and remembrance of
[46:04] these things they even though you know
[46:07] them and be established in prison and
[46:10] the present truth a means let's go to
[46:13] Luke chapter 4
[46:15] I'm gonna read verses 16 down to 21 and
[46:18] I know this is a familiar piece of
[46:21] scripture well I trust all the
[46:23] Scriptures familiar amen I trust you in
[46:27] the Bible you reading amen
[46:31] look for in 16 and he came to Nazareth
[46:35] where he had been brought up as his
[46:37] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[46:39] the Sabbath day and stood up for to read
[46:41] and there was delivered unto him the
[46:43] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[46:45] had opened the book he found the place
[46:46] where it was written the Spirit of the
[46:48] Lord is upon me because he has anointed
[46:50] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[46:52] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[46:54] preach deliverance to the captives and
[46:56] recovering of the sites of the blind so
[46:58] I had to see it at liberty them that are
[47:00] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[47:03] the Lord
[47:03] and
[47:04] closed the book and gave it again to the
[47:06] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[47:08] all them that were in the synagogue were
[47:09] fasted on him and he began to sound to
[47:12] them this day as the scripture fulfilled
[47:15] in your ears I mean my Lord bless the
[47:18] reading of his word you may have your
[47:19] seats this morning I'd like to I want to
[47:24] go into a thought this morning about you
[47:26] know we read here in 2nd Peter about an
[47:29] entrance shall be an entrance shall be
[47:32] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[47:34] everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
[47:36] Savior Jesus Christ now we know it's
[47:39] very easy if we look at the scripture
[47:40] you know it's been written over
[47:42] thousands of years through many
[47:44] different authors and and we understand
[47:47] that there's not a contradiction in it
[47:48] you know one would speak of another
[47:50] coming and then the other would prophesy
[47:52] future events and and and it is the
[47:54] revelation of God in in print form now
[47:58] it's very easy to look at prophecy and
[48:00] say you know things that are into the
[48:02] future and say that if you know that yes
[48:05] one day it will happen and it's very
[48:06] easy to say amen to that and you know
[48:08] anyone could agree like the scribes and
[48:10] Pharisees you know no doubt they you
[48:12] know and in the synagogue there and you
[48:15] know that that Jesus went where he go
[48:18] where he was raised up and he you know
[48:20] no doubt they had read that scripture
[48:23] from Isaiah many times and they no doubt
[48:25] would have discussed it and they no
[48:27] doubt would have debated about and had
[48:28] their opinion but it's very different to
[48:31] talk about the scripture in an
[48:33] intellectual way till when it becomes
[48:35] manifested in your day there's two very
[48:37] different things and so here it was now
[48:39] that the very one who gave the prophecy
[48:42] through Isaiah became flesh and he
[48:45] opened the book and he pointed in the
[48:46] book to what was being fulfilled in
[48:48] their day an hour and he just declared
[48:50] this day the scriptures fulfilled and
[48:51] they could actually see if they looked
[48:53] at what was happening in their day they
[48:55] could honestly say yes that is happening
[48:57] they know the blind have received this
[48:59] sight those that kept over being set
[49:01] free those who are bound I mean those
[49:04] that you know those are being bruised to
[49:06] be seen at Liberty this is this day if
[49:08] they really looked at it so the the
[49:11] battle always happens when the word is
[49:14] manna
[49:14] in your day that's where the contention
[49:17] that's where the controversy is that's
[49:19] where the battlers as when the scripture
[49:21] goes from just in the Bible to flesh
[49:24] that's where the battle happens that's
[49:26] where the debate will race and it's
[49:29] always when that happens is when the
[49:31] struggle happens because it's easier to
[49:34] say one day it'll happen but when it
[49:35] happens it's a very different thing now
[49:38] the Apostle Paul would say in Hebrews 10
[49:41] speaking of the Lord Jesus and his
[49:44] sacrifice he says now having therefore
[49:47] brethren boldness entered the holiest by
[49:49] the blood of Jesus by a new and living
[49:51] way which he has consecrated for us
[49:54] through the veil wishes to say his flesh
[49:56] and having an High Priest over the house
[49:58] of God he says let us draw near with a
[50:01] true heart and full assurance of faith
[50:03] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[50:05] conscience and our bodies washed with
[50:07] pure water now there came a day where we
[50:11] were Isaiah he prophesied behold a
[50:14] virgin shall conceive and that word was
[50:16] over the earth for hundreds of years and
[50:19] finally it became flesh and when Isaiah
[50:21] said he was wounded for our
[50:23] transgressions bruised for our
[50:24] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[50:26] was upon him and by His stripes we were
[50:28] healed that was released through the
[50:30] prophet Isaiah and it has circled the
[50:33] earth for hundreds of years then it
[50:34] became material amen where where it
[50:37] would go from the blood of bulls and
[50:39] goats and it would actually go to the
[50:40] plight of God Himself that would cleanse
[50:42] of people and so when the Apostle Paul
[50:44] was saying that we have a new and living
[50:46] way this was controversial in his day
[50:49] right this was controversial because it
[50:51] was a prophecy but now the prophecy had
[50:54] happened and it was now actually in the
[50:56] past and he was telling these Hebrews
[50:58] that it's not the blood of bulls and
[51:00] goats it's the blood of God that was
[51:02] shed upon the earth which is greater
[51:03] than the blood of bulls and goats you
[51:05] know it has more power it can actually
[51:07] change the inner man amen take that
[51:10] sinful nature that you're born with it
[51:11] and take it from you give you a new
[51:14] spirit and then not just early and use
[51:16] prepa then the Spirit of God comes and
[51:17] dwells in you
[51:19] a new and living way hallelujah now
[51:21] whenever whenever a a something happens
[51:25] in the scripture it's by the Word of God
[51:29] as we and I will come to second Peter
[51:32] but we understand that a tenant if an
[51:35] entrance is ministered that that
[51:37] entrance is ministered by the Word of
[51:39] God yes whenever the word is preached it
[51:42] actually creates an opening for people
[51:45] to go through into a new place so for
[51:48] example Moses you know there was a
[51:49] prophecy that Israel would be in Egypt
[51:51] for hundred years they'd be slaves in a
[51:53] deliverer would come and he would and
[51:55] God would through that deliverer would
[51:58] bring them out with a mighty hand and
[51:59] they would return to the promised land
[52:00] so here was now that prophecy was there
[52:03] it was a prophecy no doubt they talked
[52:05] about a lot but then Moses came and God
[52:08] fulfilled his word God interprets his
[52:10] word by bringing it to pass and then so
[52:12] Moses came and then he began and then
[52:14] they went to Mount Sinai and God gave
[52:17] him the Lord he preached the law to the
[52:18] people and those that received it by
[52:21] faith had created an entrance that they
[52:23] could go into the promised land
[52:24] yes right so it wasn't just saying to
[52:26] talk about anymore it was happening
[52:28] right so those who receive the word by
[52:31] faith I mean in their day it actually
[52:33] created an entrance and they walk
[52:35] through Caleb and Joshua they received
[52:37] that word the others heard the word they
[52:39] doubted Caleb and Joshua I believe that
[52:41] let's go take it they did because it
[52:44] created interest Linda going to the
[52:45] promised land yes hallelujah so it's
[52:47] always the it's always the word that
[52:50] cracks an opening for people to go and
[52:52] you take for example Peter was given the
[52:54] keys to the kingdom
[52:55] you know Jesus asked when Matthew 16 who
[52:58] to mean say that I am and they said some
[53:00] say you're a liar or Jeremias or one of
[53:02] the prophets but Jesus I said who do you
[53:05] say that I am and Peter said thou art
[53:07] the Christ the Son of the Living God and
[53:09] Peter and Jesus said to Peter blessed
[53:11] art thou simon barjona also son of Jonas
[53:15] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[53:16] this to thee but my father which in turn
[53:18] even has revealed this so the
[53:20] conversations on revelation what's been
[53:23] revealed to the people while you're a
[53:24] prophet
[53:25] you're Elijah Jeremias or one of the
[53:27] prophets but then Jesus is who do you
[53:29] say that I am who do you say
[53:30] living word is right and then so Peter
[53:33] said you're the Christ so it was
[53:35] revealed to Peter you are you are the
[53:37] Christ Jesus is the Christ and so Jesus
[53:40] saying upon this rock right not upon
[53:43] Peter the church is not built upon Peter
[53:44] Amen the church is built upon the
[53:47] revelation of who Jesus Christ is Jesus
[53:50] Christ is not who he was we can all talk
[53:53] about who he was but he's the Living
[53:55] Word in this day he's in Corinthians we
[53:57] know we no longer know him after the
[54:00] flesh we don't know him after the
[54:02] crumpled flesh we know I'm after his
[54:04] word that's how we know and last Sunday
[54:06] I was talking about the power of
[54:07] decision and when you see that would
[54:09] have God manifested in your day you
[54:10] should decide that's God and go with it
[54:13] that's how you make the true decision I
[54:15] mean so now sir upon the upon the
[54:18] revelation of who Jesus is the church is
[54:20] built upon and then so when Jesus said
[54:23] that the Peter says and I'll give to you
[54:25] the keys of the kingdom what you bind on
[54:28] earth shall be bound in heaven what you
[54:30] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[54:31] this is wounded so now how did Peter use
[54:34] the keys yes never come to the day of
[54:36] Pentecost and then the Holy Ghost comes
[54:39] down hallelujah and he's still falling
[54:41] today amen and then they've come out of
[54:43] the Upper Room acting like a bunch of
[54:45] drunk people but a bunch of dead
[54:47] tombstones living stones rejoicing
[54:49] hallelujah the promise of Joel the
[54:52] manifestations of prophecy being they
[54:54] were rejoicing and the people saw these
[54:56] people are drunk and Peter says up we're
[54:58] not drunk as he supposed but being the
[55:00] third day of the day but this is that
[55:01] spoken by the Prophet Joel that a puller
[55:03] pour his spirit out upon all flesh
[55:05] anything to tell how those wicked people
[55:07] those religious people crucified the
[55:09] Living Word for their day and that
[55:11] pricked in their hearts I said men and
[55:12] brethren what shall we do to be saved he
[55:15] said he's going to use the keys now he
[55:16] gets the keys out and he puts it in the
[55:18] doors he's repent and be baptized
[55:21] everyone you in the name of Jesus Christ
[55:22] for the remission of sins and you shall
[55:24] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you
[55:27] shout well I promise says unto you
[55:29] children as a pharaoh in his middles
[55:31] Lord our God shall call it so his word
[55:33] that he preached open the door they
[55:37] created an entrance into the kingdom
[55:40] hallelujah who's walked through that
[55:41] door Oh hallelujah Amen cuz we know
[55:46] Jesus jesus said I am the door to the
[55:48] Sheep fault he is the word right he is
[55:51] the worst so when the word comes open
[55:54] word manifest it creates an entrance
[55:56] that's why you got a when you hear the
[55:58] word receive it so that's for me
[56:00] there's no matter what commission you
[56:02] find yourself and you say Lord that's
[56:03] mine that's mine no creighton effect in
[56:06] your life it'll change you hallelujah
[56:08] but the devil loves to poke down
[56:10] unbelief some people start say oh you
[56:12] don't understand his love for you and he
[56:14] puts you in a cage get out of the cage
[56:16] I'd rather walk with God than walk with
[56:19] Satan that's for sure hallelujah
[56:23] now so now here we are an entrance was
[56:28] ministered and we know that Peter used
[56:31] the keys for the Jews the Gentiles and
[56:33] the Samaritans all different races or
[56:36] classes of people upon the earth and the
[56:38] kingdom was open the same way and it
[56:40] still was open that way to us hallelujah
[56:43] now in every age God sends his word upon
[56:50] the earth that's not a contradiction of
[56:52] Scripture
[56:52] it's the manifestation of that scripture
[56:54] yes and every in every age those that
[56:58] receive the word for their age are the
[57:01] children of the kingdom brother brems
[57:03] would say in the scene of discrepancy if
[57:05] you want to go those dimensions go
[57:06] listen to that 1965 now we've lived
[57:09] through Luther's age Wesley's age the
[57:11] Methodists age all the way down through
[57:12] the ages and the Pentecostal age and
[57:15] each age is given a promise of the word
[57:17] and the people of that age that
[57:19] manifests that promise word is the seed
[57:21] of that age according to what Jesus said
[57:23] right here they are the children of the
[57:25] kingdom that's right the manifestation
[57:27] of the Holy Spirit operating through his
[57:29] children as those seed of the kingdom at
[57:32] that age hallelujah so those who really
[57:35] receive the word for their day and God
[57:37] manifests that
[57:38] them they are the children of the law
[57:41] amen but those who do not
[57:43] amen are the seed of discrepancy right
[57:47] so Caleb manifested the promised word
[57:49] for his age
[57:50] he received Moses word and he knew that
[57:52] word wasn't for them to a debate about
[57:54] in the wilderness but to go take the
[57:55] promised land and he took his
[57:57] resurrection Mountain right but Korra
[57:59] and Dyson were the seeds of discrepancy
[58:01] they heard the same preaching they they
[58:04] they saw the same miracles and but they
[58:06] but they tried to usurp Moses Authority
[58:08] and the earth swallowed them up
[58:10] amen so now we are living in a day now I
[58:16] want to go into this just we're going to
[58:19] go into a bit of a teaching Mowgli
[58:20] now Daniel saw an image maybe I'll just
[58:24] put the image up and then we'll read all
[58:25] that now can everyone see that
[58:27] now King Nebuchadnezzar this is in
[58:29] Daniel chapter 2 King Nebuchadnezzar had
[58:32] a dream and he saw an image like this
[58:35] image where and we can read that let's
[58:39] go to Daniel chapter 2 either I'll keep
[58:41] that up there we'll read it or maybe
[58:44] maybe we won't because it's been your so
[58:52] Daniel 2 and 31 because what I want to
[58:57] show you because Peter said and you know
[59:00] what we read there in 2nd Peter he sees
[59:02] an entrance shall be ministered unto you
[59:06] so he's talking of a future time right
[59:10] so he's not talking now we know that
[59:12] they eat it into the kingdom because
[59:16] they received the Holy Ghost but Peter
[59:18] is actually speaking of another entrance
[59:20] being ministered and I wanted that's
[59:23] what I want to get into because if he
[59:24] was actually talking of receiving the
[59:26] Holy Ghost then in order to be
[59:27] ministered right that entrance but now
[59:30] the entrance he's speaking on is that as
[59:33] the rapture as the people that are alive
[59:36] and remain in the change of their body
[59:38] ok this is where I'm going if you're
[59:40] honoring what is this all about
[59:42] ok so so he sees an entrance shall be
[59:45] ministered it goes to speaking of
[59:48] something that will happen in the future
[59:49] so here we are now with Daniel
[59:51] I just want to show this here it is in
[59:53] Daniel and we're in Daniel 2 from verse
[59:59] 31 he says O king so so Daniel is now
[1:00:04] telling the King what his dream means
[1:00:06] now our King source and behold a great
[1:00:08] image this great image whose brightness
[1:00:11] was excellent stood before thee and the
[1:00:13] form thereof was terrible this images
[1:00:16] hid was made of gold his breast and arms
[1:00:18] of silver his belly and thighs of brass
[1:00:21] his legs of iron his feet part of iron
[1:00:24] part of clay till thou sawest till a
[1:00:26] stone was cut out without hands which
[1:00:29] smote the image upon the feet that
[1:00:31] ravine and clay and break them to pieces
[1:00:35] he says then then was the iron the clay
[1:00:39] the brass the silver and the gold broken
[1:00:41] to pieces together and became like the
[1:00:43] chaff of the summer threshing floors and
[1:00:46] the wind carried them away and no place
[1:00:48] was found for them and the stone that
[1:00:50] smote the image became a great mountain
[1:00:53] and filled the whole earth this is the
[1:00:55] dream and we will tell the
[1:00:57] interpretation thereof before the king
[1:00:59] they were king are a king of kings
[1:01:01] for God of heaven hath given thee a
[1:01:04] kingdom power and strength and glory and
[1:01:08] we're so ever the children of men dwell
[1:01:11] the beasts of the field the fowls of
[1:01:13] heaven shall be given to thine hand and
[1:01:16] had made the Aurora of them all thou art
[1:01:19] this head of gold now he comes
[1:01:20] interpretation remember we saw an image
[1:01:22] it of goals at that so daniel saying
[1:01:25] here beacon is your kingdom as the heat
[1:01:28] of the Simmins right and another of thee
[1:01:30] shall arise another Kingdom inferior to
[1:01:34] thee and another third kingdom of brass
[1:01:36] which shall bear rule over all the earth
[1:01:38] and the fourth kingdom shall be strong
[1:01:40] as iron for as much as iron breaketh in
[1:01:43] pieces and suggest all things and as
[1:01:46] iron that breaketh all these it shall
[1:01:48] break in pieces and bruise hmm so notice
[1:01:52] the you know the Middle's described they
[1:01:55] get harder but less value right this is
[1:01:59] the Spirit coming down now
[1:02:01] and whereas thou sawest the feet and
[1:02:04] toes part potters clay and part and the
[1:02:07] kingdom shall be divided but there shall
[1:02:09] be in it strength of iron for as much as
[1:02:12] our source the iron mixed with miry clay
[1:02:14] and as the toes of the feet were part of
[1:02:18] iron part of clay so the kingdom shall
[1:02:20] be partly strong and partly broken and
[1:02:22] whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry
[1:02:25] clay they shall mingle themselves with
[1:02:27] the seeds of seed of men but they shall
[1:02:30] not cleave one to another even as iron
[1:02:33] is not mixed with clay and in the days
[1:02:37] of these Kings this is coming down to
[1:02:39] the end right these Kings shall the God
[1:02:43] of heaven set up a kingdom which shall
[1:02:45] never be destroyed and the Kingdom shall
[1:02:47] not be left to another people but it
[1:02:49] shall break in pieces and consume all
[1:02:51] these kingdoms and it shall stand
[1:02:52] forever for as much as thou Saurus that
[1:02:56] the stone was cut out of the mountain
[1:02:58] without hands and it that had break in
[1:03:01] pieces the iron the brass the clay the
[1:03:03] silver and the gold the Great God has
[1:03:06] made known to the king what shall come
[1:03:09] to pass Hereafter and the dream is
[1:03:11] certain and the interpretation thereof
[1:03:13] sure can a man so now here's the image
[1:03:17] so so what it is now is this is the
[1:03:21] world powers to the time of the year so
[1:03:24] Nebuchadnezzar's kingdoms the head of
[1:03:26] gold and then after that the Medes and
[1:03:29] Persians took over the kingdom of didd
[1:03:31] bikinis up this is history and in the
[1:03:33] Greeks took over the Medes and Persians
[1:03:37] and this is all in the book of daniel as
[1:03:39] well but I'm just I'm just taking this
[1:03:40] part of it right and then the Roman
[1:03:43] Empire conquered the Greeks yeah and
[1:03:46] then now the Roman Empire that spirit
[1:03:49] works all the way from a word from Roman
[1:03:53] Empire that collapse they went to papal
[1:03:55] Rome and that's and and there was a
[1:03:57] division the two legs of the of the
[1:03:59] Great Schism and the Orthodox Church
[1:04:01] which yard is the Roman Catholic then
[1:04:03] there's the Eastern Orthodox and that
[1:04:05] goes all the way down to the time of the
[1:04:07] end yes that spirit conquers the world
[1:04:10] and there's and it's and it's iron and
[1:04:13] clay and the feet
[1:04:15] partially strong partially divided and
[1:04:17] as brother Isaac preached so well this
[1:04:19] is where we are and it's falling apart
[1:04:21] yes the world has fallen apart right so
[1:04:25] now so I want to show you this because
[1:04:28] it's when the image so when the kingdoms
[1:04:31] come down to the time of the end that's
[1:04:33] when the stone demon cut out of the
[1:04:35] mountain without hands comes and smites
[1:04:38] the image in the feet and all of this
[1:04:40] has crashed down to powder like the
[1:04:42] threshing floor and scattered but it's
[1:04:45] destroyed and then at this time the
[1:04:47] kingdom of God is established upon the
[1:04:49] earth right just not when the heat of
[1:04:51] gold is here it's not even when the
[1:04:54] Greeks are here or yo it's not even when
[1:04:56] the Romans are here at the beginning but
[1:04:59] it's at the feet as when the kingdom of
[1:05:01] Goddess is coming to take over we're
[1:05:06] living here if you're wondering that's
[1:05:09] why this world is falling apart that's
[1:05:11] why this world has fallen apart that's
[1:05:13] why there's no answers that's why this
[1:05:15] world is broken yes because it's iron
[1:05:18] and clay and though this it's not very
[1:05:20] strong they have all these big summits
[1:05:22] they shake hands they pretend to be
[1:05:24] friends yeah secretly they try to
[1:05:26] destroy each other yes and the world was
[1:05:28] looking at another war which the book of
[1:05:30] Revelation said there'd be three woes is
[1:05:32] the second war first the second world
[1:05:34] war is a third world it's going to
[1:05:36] happen but in the between time a people
[1:05:39] have called out amen
[1:05:40] our people have pulled out from the
[1:05:42] earth for a message goes out and try
[1:05:46] right and it finds the predestinated and
[1:05:48] it gathers them rolls them up
[1:05:50] hallelujah Emily heaven amen and in the
[1:05:54] whoa heaven amen
[1:05:55] oh yeah thank you like you take me you
[1:05:58] take World War two it was an amateur
[1:06:00] tribulation amateur tribulation I don't
[1:06:03] know how many hundred kids and millions
[1:06:06] of people died yeah I may get the figure
[1:06:09] wrong but the Russians from going from I

[1:12:50] today yes that's why you go through the
[1:12:52] Gospels you see what the son of man did
[1:12:53] and that day he does it today yes you
[1:12:56] see the book of Acts well the way I'm
[1:12:57] said that if the if the branch yo you
[1:13:00] know if the vine ever puts forth another
[1:13:02] branch it will produce another book
[1:13:04] max it'll write a book of acts behind it
[1:13:06] yes and that's just not nice language
[1:13:08] he's declaring though when God puts for
[1:13:10] the people they will produce the life
[1:13:12] you see in the book of Acts and what you
[1:13:14] see in the book of Acts will come right
[1:13:16] and not just signs wonders and healing
[1:13:18] but false brethren will come and try and
[1:13:20] take them to a former age yes that's
[1:13:22] right right the enemy will try to come
[1:13:24] in and kill the effect of the words
[1:13:26] right all those things you know you can
[1:13:29] read the book of Acts and when you read
[1:13:31] it you actually say yeah this is the
[1:13:34] story of my life amen
[1:13:35] this is the summary the believers
[1:13:37] repeating all regardless this alone
[1:13:40] Ian's 4 verse 13 but I would not have
[1:13:43] you ignorant brethren concerning them
[1:13:45] which are asleep that you sorrow not
[1:13:47] even as others which have no hope for if
[1:13:50] we believe that Jesus died and rose
[1:13:51] again even so them also which sleep in
[1:13:54] Jesus will God bring with them for this
[1:13:56] we say unto you by the word of the Lord
[1:13:59] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:14:01] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:14:02] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:14:05] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:14:07] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:14:09] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[1:14:12] Christ shall rise right then they were
[1:14:15] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:14:17] be caught up together with them in the
[1:14:18] clouds to meet the lord in the air so
[1:14:20] shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:14:22] comfort one another with these words now
[1:14:25] many times we stop reading but we've got
[1:14:28] to keep reading but but of the times and
[1:14:31] seasons so that word but is going to tie
[1:14:33] in what we've just read to what we're
[1:14:34] about to read it's one whole piece of
[1:14:37] scripture right but of the times and
[1:14:39] seasons brethren you have no need that I
[1:14:41] write unto you for you yourselves know
[1:14:44] perfectly that the day the Lord so
[1:14:45] cometh as a thief from the night who's
[1:14:48] going to come as a thief and he's the
[1:14:49] best thief a man he doesn't leave
[1:14:53] fingerprints
[1:14:53] amen only it takes a while for the
[1:14:55] police to catch up to him because
[1:14:58] they'll realize with God yeah I'm
[1:15:00] talking about the world where I'm in the
[1:15:01] police right understand then they shall
[1:15:06] say peace and safety then sudden
[1:15:07] destruction cometh upon them have
[1:15:09] travail upon a woman with child and they
[1:15:12] shall not escape but ye brethren are not
[1:15:14] in darkness
[1:15:16] that they should overtake you as a thief
[1:15:18] for year all children of the light and
[1:15:20] children of the day we are not of the
[1:15:22] night nor of darkness therefore let us
[1:15:25] not sleep as do others but let us watch
[1:15:27] and be sober for they that sleep sleep
[1:15:29] in the night and they that be drunken
[1:15:30] are drunken in the night let but let us
[1:15:33] who are of the day be sober putting on
[1:15:36] the breastplate of faith and love and
[1:15:38] for a helmet of the hope of salvation
[1:15:40] hope and the Bible's expectation right
[1:15:43] for God has not appointed us to wrath
[1:15:46] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[1:15:49] Jesus Christ right so he's saying very
[1:15:52] clearly the day is going to come as a
[1:15:54] thief but you know it in darkness you
[1:15:56] know perfectly right so this is not
[1:15:59] going to catch us unawares right the yo
[1:16:02] the bright around the world is not going
[1:16:04] to be surprised when they did in Christ
[1:16:05] rise the brighter the bright around the
[1:16:08] world is not going to be surprised when
[1:16:09] these bodies are changed right because
[1:16:12] we've been expecting it when yo when the
[1:16:15] dead in Christ race we should say I've
[1:16:17] been expecting you
[1:16:19] I've been waiting for you to come and
[1:16:21] here you are finally amen but now we
[1:16:24] know the Lord this does three things as
[1:16:27] he descends he deceives with a shout the
[1:16:29] voice of the Archangel the Trump of God
[1:16:31] and then the dead in Christ will rise
[1:16:33] first and brother Brahim says very
[1:16:35] clearly the shout is the message it's a
[1:16:37] word going forth to gather a people to
[1:16:39] become one with Christ the Living Word
[1:16:41] yes right there's what the shout is so
[1:16:43] the shout has come right it's already
[1:16:45] here we're living in a resurrection hour
[1:16:48] amen I mean you ought to realize you say
[1:16:50] always the resurrection this should be
[1:16:52] something and you say I am the
[1:16:54] resurrection because I was once dead but
[1:16:56] now I'm alive I have been quickened by
[1:16:58] the Spirit of the Living God hallelujah
[1:17:00] by his word I'll be made alive in the
[1:17:02] cell right to manifest the promise of
[1:17:05] the cell which is the rapture the
[1:17:06] translation of the Living Brian I mean
[1:17:09] with the resurrected Saints glory

[1:21:37] haiman God cried heavens and earth
[1:21:39] period hmm oh let's read that let's go
[1:21:42] to Genesis 1 and 2 amen sits in the
[1:21:49] earth the earth was without form and
[1:21:54] void this is 1 and 2 and darkness was
[1:22:01] upon the face of the deep but this is
[1:22:03] what makes the difference and the Spirit
[1:22:06] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:10] so it was without form and void darkness
[1:22:12] was upon the face of the deep and the
[1:22:14] Spirit of God moved upon the waters and
[1:22:17] then what did he do and in verse 3 and
[1:22:20] God said let there be light and there
[1:22:23] was light
[1:22:24] God brooded over the surf and the
[1:22:27] darkness and the chaos it was then he
[1:22:29] began to speak there's more than just
[1:22:31] being anointed it was more than just the
[1:22:33] earth being anointed God spoken to that
[1:22:35] earth
[1:22:36] Amen that's it hallelujah and when he
[1:22:38] finished speaking it wasn't you know it
[1:22:41] wasn't without form and void and
[1:22:43] darkness covering it it was with form
[1:22:45] it wasn't void and light covenant and
[1:22:48] there were mountains and hills and
[1:22:50] valleys and oceans and different things
[1:22:51] in paradise Eden was there and beneath
[1:22:54] were there in their place all of
[1:22:55] crashing was how God said because God
[1:22:57] spoke name and God when he finished
[1:23:00] speaking it was perfect amen
[1:23:03] hallelujah and now but then when
[1:23:05] corruption sits in it goes back into a
[1:23:08] chaos yes right so when the word is
[1:23:11] received in faith it produces Eden amen
[1:23:16] right yes that's why this world is
[1:23:18] falling apart because they rejected the
[1:23:20] message at the same time right if they
[1:23:22] received it we would have had a
[1:23:23] millennium already yes
[1:23:25] but they rejected it Israel received
[1:23:28] Solomon
[1:23:29] they had like a millennium all the
[1:23:32] neighbors had peace right the early part
[1:23:34] of Solomon's reign and was all peace and
[1:23:36] harmony because they received the gift
[1:23:38] that came to the earth and if the if the
[1:23:41] world just would receive the gift of the
[1:23:43] Holy Ghost according to the word right
[1:23:45] receive the real gift in then there
[1:23:48] would be peace and harmony among nations
[1:23:50] but now this chaos so now you take so
[1:23:54] God brooded over the earth and spoke and
[1:23:56] took chaos and brought it into paradise
[1:24:01] now when sickness comes in when when
[1:24:06] when cancer comes and let's just read
[1:24:07] this is from the law having a shadow now
[1:24:09] that little germ then cold and the
[1:24:11] mothers in the incubator while it comes
[1:24:13] it begins to develop that one cell
[1:24:15] spreads out develops another cell
[1:24:17] another cell another cell and every seed
[1:24:19] will bring forth of its kind a dog a dog
[1:24:21] a bird a bird a man a man same thing now
[1:24:24] that's where you come from but where did
[1:24:25] cancer come from it's a big growth to
[1:24:27] its developing cells started from a germ
[1:24:30] but with that germ come from
[1:24:31] I mean sees it is that tumor cataract
[1:24:34] any other germ diseases demons that's
[1:24:36] exactly Jesus says I have powder cast
[1:24:38] out Devils in his name that's exactly
[1:24:40] the gospel brother the gospel came
[1:24:42] through demonstration of the holy spirit
[1:24:44] notice down the germ between God when
[1:24:47] Christ was in the womb of Mary you're
[1:24:49] just a little teeny germ before it was a
[1:24:51] germ but what's after the gym it's a
[1:24:53] life then you're in the supernatural
[1:24:55] you're in the sixth dimension you're
[1:24:58] plumb out of human reasoning into spirit
[1:25:00] life every little germ has a life that
[1:25:03] life came from somewhere the life of a
[1:25:05] cancer came from the devil your life
[1:25:08] came from God that's the difference so
[1:25:10] he also says in one place a cell gets
[1:25:12] bruised he sees at backslides
[1:25:14] and then the demon gets into that
[1:25:16] sell because the brute produced cancer
[1:25:18] out of that cell so when when the devil
[1:25:21] comes he takes order right these bodies
[1:25:24] should be working yes right if they're
[1:25:26] in perfect health that's order right but
[1:25:29] then the devil comes in and he turns
[1:25:31] that order into chaos
[1:25:32] it turns that order into chaos so now
[1:25:35] you just take that in the physical way
[1:25:37] but then and then what happens now as if
[1:25:40] cancers in someone and they have faith
[1:25:42] in the promise of God and they believe
[1:25:43] then the life is taken out of that right
[1:25:47] taken out of the cancer then the body's
[1:25:49] got to purify get rid of the cells right
[1:25:52] if its internal vis external or can fall
[1:25:54] off right but then what happens now and
[1:25:56] that's in the physical but in the
[1:25:59] spiritual God wants us to be in order
[1:26:02] right order with his word one with his
[1:26:05] word so we hear his word it creates an
[1:26:07] entrance it takes us from chaos into
[1:26:09] order amen right so faith in his word
[1:26:11] will produce that I mean that's why you
[1:26:14] you know I trust you can look back and
[1:26:16] say what happened what caused me to
[1:26:18] become this way it's because you
[1:26:20] received faith and you believed this
[1:26:22] word and it made you change into the
[1:26:24] creature that you are I mean it's a law
[1:26:26] of faith because maybe the word will
[1:26:31] produce the promise of the work I mean
[1:26:33] but then if you take unbelief and the
[1:26:34] word will produce chaos right and that's
[1:26:37] where unbelief comes in I mean a demon
[1:26:40] spirit comes in and it takes a person
[1:26:41] from order and takes them into chaos
[1:26:43] destroy yes just like Legion he was once
[1:26:46] a normal person he was once a normal job
[1:26:49] logs Jared blogs it no Israelite on the
[1:26:52] street normal person it something
[1:26:54] happened to him yes and the devil got
[1:26:57] ahold of him and it took him from order
[1:26:59] and to chaos on the tubes filled with
[1:27:02] Legion demons but then Jesus came that's
[1:27:06] why you see something pulling you down
[1:27:08] into darkness
[1:27:09] I wouldn't stop I wouldn't let it thank
[1:27:11] you I'll see with us guys I'm looking
[1:27:12] for deeper I'm looking for a way to
[1:27:14] survive this world just get into Christ
[1:27:16] in this world it's no more than survival
[1:27:19] of a cow
[1:27:20] hallelujah then Jesus came I mean in the
[1:27:22] and and Legion gets amazing Legion comes
[1:27:26] and worships yes so just because someone
[1:27:29] begins to shout they can just be a demon
[1:27:30] shout I maybe put a bit of a thing in
[1:27:33] there maybe think about it because you
[1:27:34] look at the life that comes after Legion
[1:27:37] worship he got emotional he cried out
[1:27:39] but there wasn't enough the demons had
[1:27:42] to be cast out demons had to be cast out
[1:27:45] and that's when the demons were cast out
[1:27:47] then the end Legion was free I think the
[1:27:51] problem is what what people do you know
[1:27:53] the Bible that speaks about a City of
[1:27:54] Refuge
[1:27:55] who knows what I'm talking about in
[1:27:57] Israel they had six cities around Israel
[1:28:01] and if someone killed someone
[1:28:04] accidentally they could flee into the
[1:28:06] city or even if they don't purpose they
[1:28:08] could flee into the city and in a way to
[1:28:10] a time where their case could be hurt
[1:28:13] and if they did it premeditatedly W
[1:28:15] dragged out and killed without mercy but
[1:28:17] that on accident and they and their
[1:28:19] appeal was accepted they could go out
[1:28:20] free city of refuge
[1:28:22] so that city could hide the worst
[1:28:25] murderer in the world you following me
[1:28:28] good but until the Avenger of blood came
[1:28:31] and that person was dragged out and
[1:28:33] killed then that was dealt with you know
[1:28:35] people are cities of refuge for the
[1:28:37] devil yeah you think about this thing
[1:28:40] the devil hides the devil doesn't like
[1:28:42] to be exposed the only way you can
[1:28:45] expose them is not just say I have a
[1:28:47] problem you got to actually say what it
[1:28:48] is yes you're actually voice up for what
[1:28:51] it is
[1:28:51] God you say well I'm struggling with
[1:28:53] something what was something the devil
[1:28:55] will hide behind the something following
[1:28:58] me
[1:28:58] brother man this way city see this way
[1:29:00] you should see how people he sees in the
[1:29:01] church Facebook I don't I don't have it
[1:29:03] on me he says you should look at the
[1:29:05] people's faces when they come in the
[1:29:07] prayer line and the devil actually knows
[1:29:09] he's about to be exposed
[1:29:11] and that's why the weather's are
[1:29:13] powerful in this age because the devil
[1:29:15] has no hiding place he can hide from the
[1:29:20] doctor take it honey the psychologist
[1:29:23] but he can't hide from the Word of God I
[1:29:25] mean goodness the greatest torch-lite
[1:29:27] disease ever beam is shining in this
[1:29:29] thing holy the thing is you've got to
[1:29:32] give him up you're gonna give up you to
[1:29:34] give the devil over
[1:29:35] you've got hide them you can't be a
[1:29:37] refuge for Satan
[1:29:39] don't make me a Remus I mean you have
[1:29:42] you pull the Avenger of blood his head
[1:29:44] Jesus Christ you think God doesn't
[1:29:46] avenge his elect hallelujah do you think
[1:29:50] he just has his hands tied and
[1:29:51] sympathizes with you I'm sorry that that
[1:29:53] happened I'm sorry the devil did that to
[1:29:54] you isn't that a shame but one day we'll
[1:29:56] clear it up though we'll clear it up
[1:29:58] today and then the parable of the unjust
[1:30:01] judge he says you know that you're the
[1:30:04] woman came to the judge cried out avenge
[1:30:06] me of injury and the man gets the other
[1:30:09] judge gets tied he says well I don't
[1:30:10] fear God or man but because this woman's
[1:30:12] basically nagging me to death I'm going
[1:30:14] to do something about it and and God and
[1:30:16] Jesus says you know isn't the Lord
[1:30:19] greater than that I'm just judged and he
[1:30:21] is quick to avenge the has elected the
[1:30:23] crowd and not before
[1:30:26] I mean he will avenge them speedily I'm
[1:30:29] not talking about flesh and blood now
[1:30:30] you understand we have a we're not
[1:30:32] fighting people were fighting demon
[1:30:34] power right so now that's why it's so
[1:30:37] important he's our Avenger I mean
[1:30:39] because we cannot save one another we
[1:30:42] cannot deliver one another
[1:30:43] we can't even humanly help one another
[1:30:45] it takes him to count it take you
[1:30:47] stronger to come and help and he is
[1:30:49] stronger than them all
[1:30:52] I mean that's why you know the Avenger
[1:30:54] of blood is here put up with her my
[1:30:57] friends in the world only liked me
[1:30:58] because I was doing what they did as
[1:31:01] soon as the Lord was dealing with me and
[1:31:02] I surrendered to him they were my
[1:31:04] friends no more what kind of friend will
[1:31:06] stand with you only when you do the same
[1:31:08] thing if they were really my friends
[1:31:12] that still be my friend and they leave
[1:31:14] me I didn't leave this story you Paula
[1:31:18] Williams I didn't have to I meant to say
[1:31:20] I'm gonna cut these people out of my
[1:31:21] life they read I didn't say a word
[1:31:24] I thought I said it before what am i
[1:31:26] best drinking buddies in first year uni
[1:31:28] we really cut it up he is after that
[1:31:31] we're still at university I become a
[1:31:33] believer I don't tell them anything
[1:31:34] about it I see him in the supermarket
[1:31:37] down there a big Bush and count down a
[1:31:40] waiter for Darren Christ's youth and and
[1:31:42] it's like II yeah I saw we barely know
[1:31:45] each other
[1:31:45] how are you good you see the look on his
[1:31:48] face I don't want to be near you another
[1:31:50] secret I didn't say anything about the
[1:31:52] Lord anything and off eWEEK they will
[1:31:56] leave you you don't need to worry about
[1:32:00] all you know they will leave you and but
[1:32:02] if there's really my friend we still
[1:32:04] would have been friends yeah hey
[1:32:07] following me
[1:32:08] I mean why be someone's friend just
[1:32:10] because of such thing yeah I think the
[1:32:12] other you know the greatest friend you
[1:32:14] need is Jesus crying he will never make
[1:32:19] you look stupid yeah he will never know
[1:32:22] you know make you think you're worthless
[1:32:23] he'll do the opposite values he'll know
[1:32:28] that he's your breasts your Lord is your
[1:32:30] best friend a man it's knowing new kids
[1:32:32] like Jesus oh there's no one who
[1:32:34] understands like him Lori I know but the
[1:32:37] devil just puts a big cage over say God
[1:32:39] he doesn't care about you if it really
[1:32:42] did he would have seen to whatever more
[1:32:44] and you know and then the evil paints
[1:32:45] this picture and we believe the picture
[1:32:47] you're the problem as we think too much
[1:32:49] actually we listen too much I mean you
[1:32:52] know we should put a business hours of
[1:32:54] clothes Satan shut up problem as he
[1:32:59] speaks in your voice and he uses your
[1:33:02] emotions against you
[1:33:03] and he beats you around and India and he
[1:33:05] paints this picture all these people of
[1:33:07] this way you know if I listen you know
[1:33:09] that's it
[1:33:10] yeah that's the problem the devil sees
[1:33:12] all you know he said oh our man doesn't
[1:33:15] like you
[1:33:15] and then he would and see he just did
[1:33:18] this and see just adversity and he and
[1:33:20] he gives all this evidence he's the
[1:33:22] biggest fabricating law but if I believe
[1:33:25] his life yeah I saw he doesn't like me
[1:33:28] anymore I wonder what happened yeah well
[1:33:30] maybe I just got a distance myself you
[1:33:32] know and so if I go down this way then
[1:33:34] in reality we're still friends and our
[1:33:37] mother boy thinking what's what's up
[1:33:38] with beat that was a funny joke what's
[1:33:42] wrong but you know but the thing is if I
[1:33:44] listen to the devil and but I take
[1:33:46] ownership of those thoughts all we need
[1:33:49] a holy man's filter the Holy Ghost and
[1:33:52] our mind they're really filter is that
[1:33:55] God's thoughts on the devil saw the
[1:33:57] devil will never give me the word
[1:33:59] you'll give you maybe a lot of the wood
[1:34:01] but not the whole church I mean and the
[1:34:04] thing is you know what you just look go
[1:34:06] watch some Safari nature video what are
[1:34:09] the Lions do they go for the young and
[1:34:12] they try and scatter them out they try
[1:34:15] and separate them from the herd always
[1:34:18] and then the devil comes along and not
[1:34:20] talking about age dishes hair Lee here
[1:34:22] but what does he do
[1:34:23] separates us out well I just you know I
[1:34:26] need to see a pro and and and the first
[1:34:28] thing people don't come here fellowship
[1:34:29] anymore you know oh yeah I just you know
[1:34:34] and then they see it bred themselves out
[1:34:36] it's like a cold coming out of the fire
[1:34:37] once it was white hot burning yeah he
[1:34:40] doesn't take to it just a small distance
[1:34:42] and now it begins to cool down and
[1:34:44] there's no more heat what happens at
[1:34:45] move yeah what moved it it wasn't itself
[1:34:48] that's right are we here
[1:34:52] don't wanna you know we don't want to be
[1:34:56] separated from the hook
[1:34:57] who put that video somewhere that that
[1:34:59] zebra mum that was glorious
[1:35:02] I lied to shout it I love there so
[1:35:04] there's this baby zebra and this lion
[1:35:07] grabs it and it's going to kill it
[1:35:09] and then so the zebra the mum I think as
[1:35:11] the moment you know this you know this
[1:35:14] is shot and you see the line it's got to
[1:35:16] by the throat or something it's gonna
[1:35:17] kill the baby in the in the mum just
[1:35:19] comes in but it comes up with a teeth
[1:35:21] widen the head lady and she gets between
[1:35:25] the baby the line gives him a kick a man
[1:35:27] ran off
[1:35:31] yeah she would have been scared all this
[1:35:33] is the lion you know but you see she's
[1:35:35] got a teeth out oh oh wish I had anyone
[1:35:39] you guys are like just say this is this
[1:35:41] is the zebra this is the lion's mouth
[1:35:43] around it and you get your teeth bite
[1:35:45] right in like this hallelujah I mean
[1:35:52] let's kill someone that's my kinda zebra
[1:35:55] god bless that mom
[1:35:57] Polly she's a real mum didn't cow back
[1:36:00] all your they don't understand and you
[1:36:02] know whatever more none she stood on the
[1:36:04] word this is my child
[1:36:10] I mean if we had half the gumption that
[1:36:14] that zipper did I'll tell you what
[1:36:16] hallelujah you know if a zebra just out
[1:36:20] of nature can try and you know save its
[1:36:23] baby how much more the Bride of Christ
[1:36:25] they're going to put the word
[1:36:27] supernatural armor on caught in the hand
[1:36:33] that's why we shouldn't care for nothing
[1:36:35] I'm not here to Kerala no retreat
[1:36:38] there's no armor on the back of a
[1:36:40] Christian when I'm called to retreat
[1:36:41] we'll go back probably to take every
[1:36:44] divine promise I mean if an agent has
[1:36:47] been ministered unto us hallelujah well
[1:36:54] it's been so long Moses was ad on the
[1:36:57] backside the desert who's over 80 here

[1:37:12] one's 80 here oh it's been a long time
[1:37:15] I've been in this situation a long time
[1:37:16] that's a long time Moses was a long time
[1:37:18] right I think okay hey okay yes that's a
[1:37:23] big difference
[1:37:23] you know we need to stop looking at well
[1:37:25] it's always been this way
[1:37:26] no the world has always been this way
[1:37:29] who cares about always being the slaves
[1:37:32] bonus for today the scripture says
[1:37:34] today's the day of salvation the
[1:37:40] promises today it's not off someplace
[1:37:43] amen amen hallelujah amen that's how we
[1:37:47] should be glory to God hallelujah now
[1:37:52] where are we oh yeah brother Brown
[1:37:58] speaks a lot about turning corners and
[1:38:03] you can see in even even in Jesus's day
[1:38:06] I'm sure you can agree they turn some
[1:38:07] corners they had the law they had their
[1:38:11] scribes and Pharisees the high priests
[1:38:13] the temple the sacrifices they don't
[1:38:15] have too few short years they had they
[1:38:19] had totally moved on God had moved on
[1:38:21] sadi synagogues I had the temple they
[1:38:24] had the high priests they had the free
[1:38:25] stone all these things that was God all
[1:38:27] day but then he comes John he says
[1:38:32] behold the kingdom of God is at hand a
[1:38:34] corner was being turned right he
[1:38:37] preached the King would repent for the
[1:38:38] kingdom of God is at hand and he points
[1:38:41] out the Messiah they just turned a
[1:38:43] corner and then now here is the
[1:38:45] the Lamb of God is on the grounds to be
[1:38:47] given the one that the bulls and goats
[1:38:49] are pointing to was there yeah oh
[1:38:52] there's a quarter being turn hallelujah
[1:38:54] and then Jesus came for this cause I've
[1:38:56] come to the world gives us blood on
[1:38:58] Calvary by one offering he's perfected
[1:39:01] for them for everything that are
[1:39:02] sanctified and then when his blood was
[1:39:05] shed the lamb and the temple didn't do
[1:39:07] any good because a quarter was to and
[1:39:10] the people had to turn a corner and then
[1:39:12] their Pentecost came God pulled out his
[1:39:15] Holy Ghost hallelujah and then now
[1:39:19] there's still people who are still back
[1:39:21] with John and and Paul makes them a
[1:39:25] pulse and in the upper coast of Ephesus
[1:39:27] X 1819 and a pulse is preaching from the
[1:39:32] scripture that Jesus is the Christ
[1:39:33] proving it he's a believer but only knew
[1:39:35] the baptism of John he was back a bit he
[1:39:38] had to come forward right so now here
[1:39:41] comes Paul aney and he says well have
[1:39:42] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:39:44] have believed not when you believe but
[1:39:45] since right and then a Paul says I'm
[1:39:50] honest he says I don't know if there be
[1:39:52] any Holy Ghost well how are you baptized
[1:39:54] he said I received John's baptism and
[1:39:56] Paul said that was good but God stood
[1:39:58] the corner right God's moved on and he
[1:40:01] said i baptize name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:03] and the Holy Ghost came upon them so
[1:40:06] they came up to where God was but
[1:40:07] there's a quarter turn right and now
[1:40:10] that's the big problem as brother Graham
[1:40:13] says it's easy to build a wall right
[1:40:16] just just plow on in the same away but
[1:40:18] when it comes to the corner turning yes
[1:40:20] that's the dangerous but right man is
[1:40:24] very good at building walls but turning
[1:40:25] corners it can be difficult and there's
[1:40:29] a you know the church came out of the
[1:40:32] Dark Ages Luther the just shall live by
[1:40:34] faith there was a corner turned in
[1:40:37] Wesley came with a second work of grace
[1:40:38] you know being sanctified a corner was
[1:40:41] turned right in the Pentecostals with
[1:40:43] the gifts the corner was to be following
[1:40:47] me yeah and then the ministry of Malachi
[1:40:49] for came to the earth that was a corner
[1:40:52] big
[1:40:52] because Jesus Christ the wood was now
[1:40:54] introduced to the people yes right as
[1:40:56] John John's ministry introduced Jesus
[1:40:59] Christ the first time the minister
[1:41:00] brother Behrman choose Jesus Christ the
[1:41:02] word to the people right so that was a
[1:41:05] corner being turned and then if you go
[1:41:07] through his ministry says you know we're
[1:41:10] turning a corner but then he comes down
[1:41:12] to leadership at 1965
[1:41:14] well the last services he preaches he is
[1:41:17] now what life Luther had was
[1:41:20] justification weasely had sanctification
[1:41:22] added to it the Pentecostal had the
[1:41:25] restoration of the gifts coming back in
[1:41:26] added to it but now it's completing in
[1:41:29] the body you see these three phases of
[1:41:31] it out of that now when the resurrection
[1:41:34] comes the life that lived in them
[1:41:36] Lutheran's that went out the life that
[1:41:38] lived and the Methodists went out the
[1:41:40] life that was in the Pentecostals will
[1:41:42] all be raptured out of the ground in the
[1:41:43] body of the bride to be taken in before
[1:41:46] Jesus Christ glory to be God glory to
[1:41:48] God oh it's exciting as the truth he
[1:41:51] says we've turned a corner we're looking
[1:41:54] towards heaven watching for the coming
[1:41:56] the kept on the pyramid as we would say
[1:41:58] his coming back the church must be
[1:42:00] resurrected soon we must get ready so he
[1:42:03] says we've turned a corner amen and
[1:42:06] we're looking towards heaven so there's
[1:42:08] no more station to go to right but our
[1:42:12] next destination is heaven hallelujah
[1:42:15] your destination is right ahead of you
[1:42:17] amen hallelujah so what it's not turn
[1:42:21] here take seeking right here 30 exit
[1:42:23] here's nothing
[1:42:24] your destination is right ahead of you
[1:42:26] yes hallelujah in order for that image
[1:42:28] to be here I mean a a an entrance s
[1:42:36] three ministers of the everlasting
[1:42:37] kingdom and this word has because when
[1:42:42] God as you said on Wednesday just a
[1:42:44] little bit sees in Hebrews 1 that he
[1:42:46] upholds all things by the word of his
[1:42:48] power right so when God releases his
[1:42:51] word
[1:42:52] releases a power in that word right it
[1:42:54] gives you power you say well how's that
[1:42:56] so well if you receive the word you're a
[1:42:58] sinner in the world or just some kid
[1:43:00] religious person on a Pew and you
[1:43:02] receivers word by faith it gave you
[1:43:04] power above sin right it gave you power
[1:43:07] above the habits of the world well once
[1:43:10] you maybe drug smoke the drugs Ramnath
[1:43:12] woman whatever more then you receive the
[1:43:14] word in faith it gave you power that
[1:43:15] that thing no longer controlled your
[1:43:17] name it was under your feet yes right
[1:43:19] because the word released a power and
[1:43:22] you received it and then you released
[1:43:23] and then you continue receiving word and
[1:43:25] that word sanctifies you yes hallelujah
[1:43:28] it gives you a new nature right fills
[1:43:31] you with the Holy Ghost amen you receive
[1:43:34] the divine nature only now
[1:43:36] so whenever God releases his word it
[1:43:38] releases a power and that's why it's so
[1:43:41] important this day I mean that when we
[1:43:43] go to revelations 10 we're seven
[1:43:45] thunders uttered their voices john was
[1:43:47] sold don't write it down it's not for
[1:43:49] you it's for a future people it's right
[1:43:51] and then now it's no longer a thunder
[1:43:53] it's a voice yes and brother Graham said
[1:43:55] when the seals come open it's not a
[1:43:57] different book yes right it's not people
[1:43:59] actually did that it's saying well with
[1:44:01] your with your ministry in the way God
[1:44:03] speaks you could write another Bible
[1:44:04] says no no it's all in the scripture
[1:44:07] right it's all there just has to be
[1:44:09] revealed and then right it's all sitting
[1:44:11] there it just has to come open I mean
[1:44:14] you say well how can that be well let me
[1:44:16] ask you something who's read through
[1:44:17] this book then it all become clear to
[1:44:21] you the first time how about the second
[1:44:24] time it becomes more clear to you as you
[1:44:30] read it but it's all there right it
[1:44:32] doesn't you know God didn't suddenly
[1:44:34] seen an angel ah there's another chapter
[1:44:35] here now I can read this and this comes
[1:44:37] open no it's all here
[1:44:38] yeah but the 1st or 2nd 3rd 4th haven't
[1:44:41] you know you can read through it so I
[1:44:43] never saw that before but you've read it
[1:44:45] before right but it has to come open to
[1:44:48] you yes
[1:44:48] Alleluia is wasting it's like that's why
[1:44:51] the ministry Mel powerful was that the
[1:44:52] word would come open I wear things where
[1:44:55] people would say how does this all mean
[1:44:56] and Victor is it this is what it means
[1:44:58] in your oh well that's easy
[1:45:01] well I was I losing hear about this but
[1:45:03] with man it's always that way but God
