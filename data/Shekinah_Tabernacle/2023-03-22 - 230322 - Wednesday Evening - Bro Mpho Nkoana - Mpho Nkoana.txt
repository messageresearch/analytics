stopwatch present and start amen are we there if you there please say amen i would like us to read it in this way is the scripture that you know brother ben will start just one verse then pass the mic

sister maggie it goes there sister sorry this the elder sister maggie the younger one behind you brother ben says maggie and then sister kay and then becca then one two one two three four five six

thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen let's jump to the next one this way for what oh yeah oh sorry there's two more verses we let's my married let's just oh it's episode sorry sorry this is not favoritism i just realized that there's an extra base i'm sorry 14 for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you amen dave but if you forgive not mean the trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses amen let's pray heavenly father once again we thank you for the reading of your weight lord we ask you my father my god to bless it to our hearts lord may this word not just be a usual the lord's prayer maybe anew in our hearts when you refresh it lord may you take it lord and open it anew that we can see it differently that we can experience it differently my father my god i pray that you bless the weight to the hearts of your people take our hearts take our minds lord and put them under subjection we commit father god the service we commit everything that will be said and done that it may be done for your honor and for your glory my father my god we ask these things father not forgetting to ask you lord to forgive us where we have gone wrong in our ways in our in our our ways of this earth father the flesh we are wearing often do mistakes and disappoint you and let you down i pray that you forgive us lord as we want to confess before you that we forgive anyone who might have wronged us father we lift up our hearts unconditional lord lord forgive our brothers and our sister and anybody who might have wronged us for the bible says if we forgive you will forgive us lord we thank you for this word lord we ask these things in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ and the church says amen please enjoy the comfort of your seeds now yeah you can pasito thank you brother marion thank you so much so we we we are going to speak about the kingdom of god sister maggie was was the likey one the blessed one all blessed but you read the verse that is our title tonight our title tonight i would like us to talk about uh something that we know but we often are not don't zoom into it it says thy kingdom come now that's our title tonight thy kingdom come that is the verse 10 part of verse 10 says thy kingdom come so you will notice brothers and sisters that that verse and that that that word kingdom in the lord's prayer it comes twice am i right don't invest 13 it says and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is there for thine is the kingdom so it comes for the second time it may not be the only way that comes twice or thrice but that's what stands out for me tonight that it says for thine is the kingdom that kingdom that we are saying thy kingdom come is coming again down in verse 13. the question may be if the kingdom must come where must it come where must it go to where must if we sing in the lord's prayer every day if you are praying the lord's prayer you say thy kingdom come where must it go where must it come to huh and i want to provoke our thoughts tonight to provoke and um if i can pierce your hearts with the word of god tonight along the thought that says thy kingdom come and we'll just expand it and maybe read um another scripture which is matthew 12 and you'll see where i'm trying to go we'll read matthew 12 and uh verse 22 praying that you can the lord will just help us all of us as we just want to relax in the presence of the lord amen amen are you happy are you only here amen [Music] verse 22 the bible reads this and then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and damp and he healed him in so much that the blind and dumb both spake and so are we together we're going to read it from 22 to 28. and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of david but when the pharisees heard it they said this fellow that not cast out devils but but by belize above the prince of devils now something to think about they they saw and they heard him about him casting devils dumb speak dumb dumb speaking right the dumb speaking and the blind sea they saw but now all they could say the pharisees was this man cast out those devils using belizabe and remember who belle zaba was belzebab was the prince of denver's noted and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself brought to desolation he's saying to them hey it's okay for you to accuse me that i'm casting these demons with a bigger demon but the question i'm sending to you the lesson i'm giving to you is that every demon huh i mean every kingdom that is divided against itself surrender into desolation it will fall right every city or house divided against itself shall not stand that's what the lord is saying to them he said okay faith that's fine you may be in your own minds thinking that you are right but listen if you are saying i am belsabab and i'm you saw me casting the devils out huh what should that make them to think how can this man being a devil cast out devils because otherwise the kingdom of the devil will fall the kingdom of the devil will be destroyed that means if this man cast out demons then he is not a demon let's hold it there the issue here is about the kingdom almost everything on earth today is talking about a kingdom it's about the kingdom kingdom i want you to think about government you know in our day today's language government kingdom everything you know is managed under a certain kingdom a certain power a certain system that's what i want you to think along those lines they saw this the lord jesus casting the demons out and they've got clear evidence that they they experienced the evidence they saw it and they say he's a demon how can that be how will that make strengthen the kingdom of the devil right let's continue where was i verse 20 5 energy we already read that one let's go to 26. and if satan casts out satan that's the question he is divided against himself now that's a common sense isn't it but you see revelation doesn't use common sense revelation those guys like revelation they did not have it they could not see something that is glaring that is so clear right if satan casts out satan he is divided against himself how shall then this kill his kingdom stand and if i by balance above cast out devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you the kingdom now i want us to think like this what is a kingdom what is a government let's just have a chat what is the government what is it what is a kingdom you see a a government or a kingdom is a system that is made to it's a system of control of managing we make a system to manage things or to control or to coordinate or to lead we make a system that is now called a government in today's today's language a government is now you know we've got the different ministries the ministry of health the minister of education the ministry of social you know we've got the um parliament and we've got the courts the judiciary you know and then we've got different institutions we've got different agencies you know that that belongs to government all those things together they form what you call a government they form a kingdom if you like so all of them each and everyone is supposed to work with another agency in harmony they are supposed to work together there's no one there's no one who's going to be doing this and another one fires him and do something different no no every department every ministry every government agency everybody or organ work with another organ in harmony otherwise the kingdom will fall so that is what the government is right now there's different agencies and organs and then each and every one of them they've got links you know so another one that's up to here another one takes over if another one that does for up to here another one now social development they'll give the benefits and they'll give study link and they'll give our elderly people their money right and then and another one mb will will then provide them where under acc will give if someone gets injured we pay them your own fund another one on the sec giving people money for it for being injured and another agency also giving money for the same thing otherwise they are not working in colu they are contradicting each other right you won't find the department of doing driver's license competing with another one no no they work together even the documents that are issued correspond with one another that is the thinking about the whole idea of a kingdom working together in harmony to achieve a certain goal right now it can they cannot contradict one another otherwise the kingdom falls and that's the message i was trying to say so there's different types of governments and some are called some government is called an only an oligarchy have you heard of that word and oligarchy and oligarchy is a government where um few people control just a few people they are in charge that's a few group of people they are in control then they form a government the whole country of five million people or whatever number they are interested they are called what you call an oligarchy government another type of government is a monarch which is more like ours our we are what we are a constitutional monarch right we are led by the queen is the queen is the head of government the head of state in new zealand right although some people combines some of these types of government you can have a hybrid type model right so we are a monarch we have control the queen can you know can is the head of the state is the head of government she can come and dissolve government right so that is a monarch one person in church thank you one person being the monarch and that can be a monarch in the entrance in the family right that is another form of government back where i come from there's also kings there's a little country on the on the corner of south africa next to mozambique it's called eswatin or swaziland it's still ruled by a monarch the the king thinks in the morning that today there's no more parliament or appoints parliamentarians and ministers you see because they are not a constitutional monarch they are not the democratic sort of monarch and then you have another type of government called a democrat democracy this is the one that we are more used to democracy you see so that one this is a government where uh all adults you know everybody tends to have an opportunity to decide who should govern who should form part of the government so people elect the representative and then those representative becomes mps and then um hip kings mr hipkins is our local mp here in rimutaka and then each and every area elect an mp then they go there to be hive then they represent us to form a government but in a democracy we nominated them to form a government but all these things that i'm explaining to you are called types of governments right we know that all those governments the devil offered them to the lord they are he's he controls them there's nothing like this one is better than that one no no that's just to confuse mankind all of them same children of the same mother right with their prayers with their corns but there's one government that i want i want you to know to note here it's called a messianic a messianic government it's called a messianic kingdom oh yes right also that one it has got members are we together but that one the prophet says that one uh is a is is a mystic body it's a universal mystic body what's the meaning somebody could have can google so they were in church you can't google what's the meaning of the word mystic it's a mystic body to which christ is the head it's a body where christ is the head right and it is ruled by love you walk in the spirit in that government you see it's also another system but it says it's a heavenly system that one that is another government our government are we together so that is that is the background of what a kingdom or a government is are we understanding it so today we are going to do more teaching more preaching just just just to hybrid not hybrid but just to mix it up a bit that's a bad way we don't want to hybrid it but just if i teach or go slow just follow me come with me but if i start to be energized and i start to be noisy also please follow me amen i appreciate that you made time to come to church amen now we have read about uh when they were accusing the lord that he is blessed about and now we also understand what the government or the kingdom is are we together now we can see that a government must work together in harmony and we understand that the government cannot work against itself if it was to achieve his goal amen now let's i want to to bring it to you that uh what did i do now i want to bring it to you here and say i want to to zoom more at an individual level why i want to zoom into an individual level as much as the government as a system is working together us as a body as a body we are like a kingdom right but you as a person as an individual as an individual you're also just like a little government there's a kingdom the head of it is brother ben's head he's got a body right it's a cup it's a system it's a certain way which is controlled and i'll show you how why i'm saying this if you think of it taking our previous example and you think about a body of a person huh if a body of a person can work against each other it has a problem if one part can start that is why a body now if it gets sick it is because there are some soldiers in the body that are fighting there's good soldiers there's best soldiers that that came and then like like russia they went into ukraine of my body and they bought they're trying to bomb and bomb now the ukraine of my body soldiers are fighting back i'm just using that as an example because there's a current war going on right now the good soldiers and the bad ones i'm not saying in relation to russia and ukraine there i don't know whose bed was good but the point is this our soldiers in the body protects the the government protect the kingdom that is why you get sick now what do you do when you get sick who can tell me what do you do when you get sick a man another one recover how do you recover what do you do to recover [Laughter] you eat build on somebody says something like medicine you take the medicine to recover right in other words you are trying to boost and support the soldiers of the body so that the kingdom can stand are we together so that's what you are trying to do otherwise the kingdom will fall we'll say oh he was he was a good man and we bury him because the kingdom has fallen right so that is what me and you do at channel level so there's a spiritual level there's a body spiritually if me and you go an extra mile and you their brothers and sisters on video if you go an extra mile to go to the doctor to recover for operation you drink medicine you sleep you eat biltong for you to recover you do all sorts of things for this body to to recover to boost the immune system which are the soldiers of the body what must happen to the spiritual body which is your spiritual government what happens what what do you do do you just leave it what happens when your spiritual body gets weakened gets attacked by some soldiers the problem is this we are very very good and i'm sorry let me be frank we are very good in acting to support the colonel soldiers we are very quick but when we come to the soldiers of our spirit our spirit our soul so that that kingdom can stand we go slow the ammunition comes slow why does the ammunition come slow david i don't understand why if if now i feel hungry that hey i'm weak man i must go and eat huh if i feel that hey my food is aching i must take ibuprofen you know i will prove him and then you find that before you know it it even knocks you down you sleep and then you wake up the pain is gone hey sister you wake up the pain is gone you you help the body to recover but now there you are one week you haven't spoken to your father one day you have not had one thought about your father huh remember there's one principle about war you're either for them or against them right there's no three ways about it there's no middle way where you say no i was just lazy i was just too tired i did not oh i didn't have a close-up with the lord there's no two ways about if you didn't do it that means you're supporting the other side that's a very hard one but is the truth you are either swim you either swim or use or you drown now if you find yourself that you are not swimming the way you are supposed to swim you must know that from that point you are drowning if you are not fighting or supplying the ammunition for the soldiers of my body for the kingdom to stand you must know that you are supporting like the other side that's an automatic rule of law you are not doing that but we need to be able to come to a point where we that we immunize you you you you put more ammunition in the body and not be in denial if i did not do what i'm supposed to do for my kingdom to stand for my spiritual body to be strengthened i must accept it you see the people who actually accept when they are wrong they are the ones who get help they are the ones who grow they are the ones who get empowered because they are not in denial they do a self-introspection but let's not go that route the point i wanted to bring to you was if a physical body we can make such an effort the same thing or two three four double quadruple must happen to our spiritual body it must get the same vitamins i must go on a spiritual cheeto thing and i feed it i must order that that shop what do you call it while they bring the green stuff you know that shop where they just order they brain hello fresh i must have my halo fresh every week i must have order it every day i must make sure the food that my body eats otherwise my soul the ammunition of my body will be weakened otherwise the soldiers of my body will otherwise my kingdom will be weakened that's the kingdom that i want us to focus on tonight you see now if we read in the book of luke 17 i'll read it for you that 17 verse 20 and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation now we're demanding him to know hey when is the kingdom of god coming and he said the kingdom of god does not come by your observation by you seeing it neither shall they say lord hear o lord there for behold the kingdom of god is within you let me tell you something we will get to it the kingdom of god is within you actually let me put it blunt you are the kingdom of god you are part of the kingdom of god you are the kingdom of god why am i saying that he said the bible says um we are in isaiah i think it's isaiah nine or six we'll come across it he says that we're going to have a son and that son is going to be prince cancella and the kingdom of the government will be upon his shoulders am i right his shoulders will be on his shoulders who are the shoulders isn't it that you are the body if you are the body that the bible says the kingdom of god is upon the shoulders of that son he is the head and you are the shoulders the body so the kingdom is upon you in other words we are here managed under other governments but actually we are managed by a different government we are of a different kingdom [Music] that's who we are right here on earth it is within you a body i'll take let me take you more deeper in the body a body is so fascinating that we only see the outside you know inside there's something that is called a cell you know a cell there's something called a cell a cell is is is a little little kingdom by itself a cell a cell in a human being starts from one cell right then they say it multiplies trillions and trillions of cells every day trillions and trillions of cells we are just we are just cells but cells make tissues tissues makes organs then organs may get bored that's the system that's the government of this one so that cell that cell in itself he's got his own life it's it it functions if you if they open yourself you're going to be amazed you must go on youtube and check you'll find that inside a cell it's like a whole fact there's manufacturing every day of new cells the people not the people but to me they were like people those those little animations they're working inside the cell but you know what we've got millions and millions and millions of cells in your body some die millions get created every day so inside the little cell imagine if a cell gets attacked by another wrong cell what will happen to the government of that little cell huh just imagine just imagine this whole big kingdom called the universe that god has set in place and works in harmony and works together where jupiter has got its own orbit where mars where satan where every other planet where all the galaxies are working in harmony just imagine if another one one day decides to go on the root of the other one what will happen to that government call it the universe what will happen to that kingdom chaos just imagine if the day what today a day just decide that today i'm not going to come from the east i'm going to come from west going that way just think about what will happen everything will shatter because we won't even know what is the time our systems in here our so-called government will fall the new zealand dollar will be minus one because the sun started from this side today the matter of everything will fall why because some of our greater governments and kingdoms are confused one thing keeps them on hold one thing and one thing alone and that's the love of god for god so loved the world remember after brother and the priest he like telling us about the ideal condition god created the earth in a certain condition and he set up the systems how everything must function and they are held by his love like this he spoke and then logos came out of his mouth at i don't know what speed and then he said stop and everything stopped and then everything started to blossom and every planet everything you know everything was just like brother branham if you listen to him correct him dramatizing it when the son of god created when god said let there be and everything came spew out of his mouth like that and create god created and everything was like beautiful and started to function like that right now that's the government that's a kingdom by itself it's a system that controls how the universe work and it works with each other in harmony same thing with the human body to the smallest smallest smallest part for the band called a cell everywhere we've got we are just a bunch of cells but what is wonderful about it and inside each and every cell there's a lot of work happening a lot of work and inside them those members they are busy working in harmony let's just let a cancer cell come in there you'll see now if the cancer cell comes in there and then the physical science medical science fails to remove it another force another power from somewhere from another kingdom comes and it crushes it what what what happened to the cancers that brother branham prayed and even among us today the word of god was broken and cancer disappeared what kind of of of of soldiers were brought there in the body if you think about it carnally you can't explain it but the soldiers came some soldiers from somewhere they may call them aliens i don't know but some some soldiers came and said hey you guys you medical science failed to remove you you can't now boom and then suddenly that cancer was gone what happened to it medically they can't explain it right but it's because a different different ammunition from somewhere came a different kingdom now uh i was at verse 22 of luke 17 and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of these days of the son of man and you shall not see it and they shall say unto you see here or see there go not after them no follow them and this is the day we are living in that day when they are telling us hey there there he says don't go there for as a lightning that light lighted out of the one part of under heaven shine it unto the other part under heaven so shall the son of man be in this day it has already shined from the east to the west right it has already shined the word of god has already moved from the east to the west where the sun set this is the day we are living in this is the day where the military of our kingdom when it comes everything runs everything should run if it does not run there is a problem somewhere within the kingdom something must be done talk to the general talk to the captain because there's a hierarchy everything you see that the devil is trying to do he's actually trying to copy what god has already done hierarchy seniority you know he's the head the devil wants to be the head you see he's coping but because him he's satan he's a perverted guy he's doing it in a wrong way so there's hierarchy also in heaven god is the head there's angels there's shadow beams there's that there's even arch angels are we together so the devil tried to copy that now talk to the general excuse me talk to the general if there's a problem engage the members of the kingdom don't let your body go down and you come to a point of complacency where your eyes are like samsung's ones have been taken out where you accept the status call to a point where you accept abnormal as normal no it must not be that way let's read what the prophet says there oh yeah let me finish luke 17. but first must he suffer many things and be rejected for this generation and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days here what happened in the days of noah i'll give it to you more spiritual the physical part you know it in the days of noah noah built the ark after building the ark he finished it and then he he put what's that the thing that he put on the ark to pitch it what did he use he used gopher wood and then he applied what ta he applied it applied it why to put the act together so that the ark when the water come it must not come through no enemy forces can come through right he sealed it hallelujah right and then he pissed it and then it was able to float by the so so what happened that time is happening today it will be like in the days of noah today god is busy pitching the ark he's pitching it pitching it so that this kingdom no enemy can be able no flat when the time for flood come you cannot sink we have been peace today my sister we have been pissed the ark is being pitched is closed the lord is about to close the door it's like i can see him he's almost going to close the door so let's make sure that ah we are being pitched because that part that cannot be peace is going to disadvantage the kingdom every one of us has got an important role to play remember at the beginning i told you that we are a mystic body there is this kind of people i'm sorry brother let me just pass that one there is this kind of believers when the word is being preached them they are thinking of the person next to them huh and sister venus that the word is being principled or not but i'm busy thinking arnold really must look into this huh but the word is talking to me i i i i i'm lacking the revelation of actually what the body is all about because i am being pissed i am being strengthened i am being solidified i am being given the ammunition but i'm passing it to my friend who does not need what i'm being given he needs that the lord is busy dealing with him in a different ammunition ammunition but i'm passing it to system i guess you know stomach you really must look into this but the way it is talking to me let us not be those kind of believers when the word talks don't even think of them of the minister don't even think of the one next to you think about yourself because it is addressing you the word is addressing you to to you are being pieced yeah you are you are the the flood is about to come the prophet has spoken because that is now he said here it will be like in the days of noah it's exactly going to be there's many things that i can tell you that are like in the days of noah but i'm just wanting to focus on what happened to the ark they pitched it pissed it pissed it past it and it does not destroy it without with the flat right but the problem in the message uh checks each book uh he says here that means the mystery of the test and the wheat of matthew 13 24 30 is now also fulfilled another parable put forth put he fought unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like an unto a man which saw with good seed and he's filled but while man sleep slept his enemy came and sold tests among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and abroad fought fruit then appeared the test also you see what happens is this and there comes a time in the life of a believer or a person where you you you you sleep i'm not talking about physical sleeping there comes a time when you you snooze the bible says we must not be and what's the weight slothful thank you that's not the worst one who was that thank you brother well the bible says you must not be slothful spiritually we must be alert we must not sleep because when we sleep because god has planted the seeds in our lives when we sleep the enemy comes and he plants the seeds that's when we sleep spiritually you cannot sleep while you are in the kingdom you can't sleep while you are at war imagine i saw the pres the prime minister of ukraine walking on the street with soldiers i mean is the prison or maybe you expect him to be in comfort hiding in the bunker no no he's busy how can he sleep there is war putin is busy because we are in a state of war we cannot afford to sleep spiritually because you can just be a little point of weakness for us to lose the war but because god cannot lose no no when we sleep the enemy comes and he plants the seeds and you know what's the danger my brother my sister do you know what the danger those sins of the enemy because the enemy comes like at night and he plants the seeds and then we wake up in the morning we don't know anything we don't know that the seeds have been planted in our kingdom we don't know and then we wake up we continue with life the problem is going to come when the blade of grass or that that they geminate the bible says uh but when the blade was sprung up when they they started to grow and the bible even says up and brought fruit you see you're stuck there it is on the board thank you you start to see them when the fruit come just tell me how long does it take for the fruits to come imagine from the time of planting until the time of the fruits the enemy planted wrong seeds but you are only going to see them when the fruit come that's a long time why simply because you and me we slept wake up one morning there's a wrong fruit here what is happening because i slept at war you know if you sleep on duty we don't even take you for a hearing we fire you if you sleep on duty fired and now that's the kingdom of the devil they fire you ask we wake you up you say hey my friend wake up my brother with love because our kingdom remember what is the lord pitching it up with you know that that combination of love the holy spirit himself he's pitching it so you don't wake up your brother and say hey brother you'll go to hell no no no that's not love of course love is corrective you come first of all with the right attitude your inside of the inside must love bad brother and bad sister love first why because the first thing that god did the first thing he loved us and then he came after loving us he was able to overlook to see beyond our sins to see beyond our fall when you love your brother you are able to see beyond what he's doing even if what he's doing has hurt you you've got a wound he exposed you and you were short you said my friend i'm short here's the wound you know you know i was short because of i think you there you you slept a bit so next time when you go there and then you know you come with a right attitude with the right spirit and then you are able to win your brother or your sister beg you you me and you must see beyond so that i like to stand closer to the people right the fruits come and then we are amazed why because when we were sleeping which is something we were not supposed to do the devil came and put the seats after that the time goes time goes time goes time goes and then we start to ah yeah what's happening why are the seeds no no no no seeds were planted long beach all this time you are praying you are doing things you think you are watering the right thing no no there are seeds there that is what the bible says check up let's check up ourselves let's go to the doctor and check up ourselves isn't it we take these bodies to their doctor we just wake up one day plus yeah new zealand is cheaper i just wake up i want to go to check up i must go for checkup let's go to the spiritual checkup yes sir and i check ourselves so that the doctor can say hey my brother you did well by coming did you know one of your teeth is shaking it did you did you know you say no i'll take it out for you there's an infection here did you know that no doctor i never know nothing then sistana takes it out for you huh or she just give you the injection then you are good because you go for a checkup let's go for to checkup and when you vote for checkup has anybody ever argued with the doctor when the doctor you know stephen says that we've got a lot of nurses here stabilizers for my sister and it's the opponent you know in their days when they're there when when they tell you you agree with them even if even if you are the brother in church and you go there they must give injection you allow them to give you injection because they are doing their duty isn't it you don't argue they are telling you that if we put this injection here rather than poor it is going to be effective you don't say no sister vanessa i put it here no no you don't like she puts it there then it works and you say then tomorrow you can come to church and say god bless you right but the point i'm trying to say is that when you go for a spiritual checkup and then the lord brings things to your remembrance don't argue with them until you even come here for communion and you eat communion with the wrong seeds in life it's simply to go to your sister and say system like you forgive me my sister you know when i was thinking last night i didn't have a good thought about you can you forgive me that's all he does that the moment you expose him he runs like he he just goes into mist the moment you go to the lord and say lord lord forgive me let's say lord thank you for reminding me that that thought in my mind was not a good one about my brother or my sister that i exposed the body my body first of all forgive me my father and you go with all your heart you know what the devil is dead that and that even before you go to your sister there and there the devil is dead because you confessed your sin before the lord and blessings are upon you they are coming your way fruits they come the wonderful thing is this then appeared the test also so the servants of the householder came and said unto his unto him say didn't you did you know that was so good cease in the field and we know the story he said oh no no it's fun because they are there already those leave them there's coming time for reaping when we get to that time we are going to start with them and we bind them we bind them we back this is the time for binding find them bind them and they go to the fire so we don't even have to come to a point where the fruits come let's always be in a mode of war in a mode of fight all the time with the devil amen now the divisions in any kingdom causes it to follow right and then it's but it you you will find out that every fall or every destruction or every coup huh everything in think about all the types of governments with including a body that i've mentioned everything starts in from inside it starts from inside a coup when they they topple the government where does it start from inside if you see something happens and the government falls inside when my body gets sick and i die the soldiers of the devil came attacked the body from inside everything so we must always check ourselves from are we together believers before i say brother armand remove this little tick from your eye no no i must first check from my inside and remove my beam so that i can see that oh i'm sorry brother i did not see you don't even have a stick i was not seen properly because i didn't remove my beam first you don't even have that so we always need for the things to get work better imagine imagine if everyone checked from the inside first no one will have to correct another one the pastor will just be coming here in every every day and say i greet you all of you today and we pray and he says can i tell you something right you're going home and then we go home the pastor won't have a tough job that imagine the holy spirit come here and preach and tells us to stop lying and then we go home and we are in denial we don't want to accept it are we fighting for the body or against the body may god help us eh the moment one part starts to work against the other part we are going down just like how a human body worker spoke about diseases i won't repeat that but the point i want to bring to you is that i want to emphasize on this point if it is so easy for us to look after this physical body let us then do our due diligence for a spiritual body every day my sister my brother let's do it every day then you'll receive the results then you're not gonna be amazed when the time for fruits come i'm almost closing it remember i promised you that i will be short right i want to read for you here from the spoken word is the original seat the spoken weight is the original the bible said it would is that right i have 9 6 okay it's coming to that point that i raised earlier and to us a child is born so is given the name shall be called counselor prince of peace mighty god everlasting father and his kingdom shall be and his kingdom shall be no shall have no end and the government shall be upon us and the shoulders are on there on the body and you are part of them imagine if you are on the shoulders you're on the top man but i'm so happy even if i'm at all a small one i'm very happy because i know that i'm part of the body and the shoulder is going nowhere without me you see that is very exciting it doesn't matter whether you are at all yeah that's right oh hey what do you call this one it doesn't matter it does not matter but you are part of the body a shoulder or an egg is going nowhere i told you so that's a very important part if you want to see that a small toe is important cut it yeah oh boy and run try to run yeah have you ever seen someone who when we were boys we used to play mario on barefoot winter summer we go to school you know and then sometimes we didn't like but regularly that's how we grew up you know that's the life we grew up and i'm very proud of that kind of a life now sometimes in the midst of winter it will be so cold that hey your feet will crack not enough shoes eh you'll see shoes christmas time huh now and then if we are playing soccer playing soccer playing soccer and then another one blocks me and then your toe cuts from the bottom you know just have a little crack a small small little crack oh you must see that boy going to school why i mean the whole body why can't he just walk that's a small wound no no that is very important because it's part of the body has any of you ever had a small little pimple a small small small one on the tongue on the side you even have a headache you even develop a headache and bra marion i can't come today to work my brother why marion i've got such a terrible headache from last night what's the cause of that i think i have to be pimple people yes a good employee will understand that a pimple affects the whole body so the point i'm trying to say here is the importance of every part of the body wait until you have that little pimple inside the nose no one will touch you no you cannot touch me on the pimple on the nose my wife knows so it is very slow and it can cause a headache it can cause problems for the body what i need to do is to have medication if we can do all those things but yet when we approach some parts of the body we deal with them like them they are not important why is it like that help us lord so the government will be on his shoulders right which is us remember we said the kingdom of god is within you so if the government here in new zealand every department is important that means this government called shakkaina tabernacle must always be under the sunlight beam must always be under the shekinah glory for one another alone with you i must be the same i must love you the same not only when i see you i i i smile with you why not when i'm alone as a ha that one i'll just pray no i'm a slav unconditional i don't know why i'm going that route but the point is this the shoulders will be upon his government and i mean the girl i'm sorry the government will be upon his shoulders and he says brother branham in that spoken word and the government shall be upon his what that's what they wrote the congregation said shoulder that's part of his body my that is his body it is it is it sorry brother is asking is it his shoulders is his body where is the government on the earth at in other words you and me are part of god's government on earth we are the authority of god's government on earth in his body saying shall judge the earth remember that's right paul said i dare you to go to court with one another and not take it before the church right see saints shall judge the earth where is the government going to be upon upon his shoulders his body the government upon his shoulders that's the part of his body what is it his earthly strength god's earthly strength is his weight made flesh in his body you your god sweat made flesh you you've got the government you've got the authority you've got the kingdom you are part of the kingdom the only thing is that you are working in harmony with another part of government you know to achieve every kingdom is within you but every part works with another one in collusion to achieve the goals of government in conclusion i want to read for you a little piece along a piece here from the spoken word faith is our victory right listen carefully this is now emphasizing on the head of government right christ the hope of glory right who is the head of this church jesus christ what kingdom is it the messianic kingdom the messianic kingdom the church not an organization a church a mystic body to which christ is their head oh i love that walking in the spirit obeying the king foolish to the world foolish to the world the way i the world must call me a fool then i know i'm on the right track i know when the third the moment they start calling you attack that foolish guy you know the christian one then you know that ha you're fulfilling the scripture foolish to the world precious in the sight of god working in the spirit misunderstood loved ed made fun of all that live in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions those are persecutions if they persecuted the prophets which were before you called the master of the master of the building belts above how much more will they call them of his disciples but you are walking in the spirit turning your back to the things of the world not bound by fetus who he who the son has made free is free indeed amen that's the church of the living god that's who set it up that's who set it up now we see in in in witnesses in acts 1 8 he said you shall be my witnesses after the holy ghost has come on you it is the holy spirit it is the presence of the lord in our life that pitches this building that pitches us and it makes us one kingdom one unit irrespective of what we see here or or experience but the love for my brother my sister must be unconditional the way i approach him amen now what is the church the mystic body of christ who set it up okay i've already read that one he is the king he wants to be king he wants to rule us he wants to be lord people let him in say people let him in say i let him let be myself let him be my savior but they won't let him be the lord lord means ownership it means rulership how can you say is your lord but you don't want him to rule or own over you i'm here to see a woman who's married who does not want to be to change her surname i'm sorry if there's those ones like that but ordinarily typically or let's say ideally she's supposed to change his neighbor or not because she's becoming she's becoming a milan so ownership rulership come into my heart lord save me from hell but don't tell me what to do take everything you want but don't tell me what to do is that how we want it help us my father my god he must he must tell us what to do because he's a prince of peace he's the prince of love he knows exactly how to say it to you how to tell it to you how to pitch it to you he knows what you can take what you can take because he's the prince of peace he's the prince of love some of us ask brothers we will overuse that authority we say hey sister i'm the head remember you must take everything no no the kingdom of peace don't approach things like that that's right so let's be careful dear brothers that's the attitude of the people take everything but don't tell me what to do that's the reason no wonder the bible says all the tables have become full of vomit you know what vomit is as a dog tends to eat vomit to his vomit if these organizations didn't work in the first place time in the first time and a god had to vomit them out you will go back to them they will make you vomit again so we cannot afford to associate ourselves with the things of the world we take our body for the checkup regularly we make sure that everything is above board amen i'm reading now for you here from the spoken word five definitive identifications of the true church of the living god 1960 and you know what vomit is as a dog turns into his vomit and these organizations didn't work in the first place in the first time and you go back to them they'll make you vomit again he said i will i will that you were hot or cold because you are because you are lukewarm i spew you out of my mouth you make god sick at his stomach he vomits out not you shakkaina this is just a warning that as we are targeting on this road along the way we are going to come across a detour which wants to take us into a wrong way watch out shakkaina there's coming a time we were told even on wednesday last week that there's no two ways about it it's coming the persecutions are coming but as we walk along the journey let us be ready let us be fully fully immune let us be fully armed fully armed with enough ammunition and have you know that missile where if you shoot the enemy you take his position and that bullet will not stop until it knocks the enemy left such have such kind of bullies amen brother branham prays here and in the in this book and he says dear god i will ask thy divine mercy upon these waiting per penny and soul souls penny penitent souls who believe that you are and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him and i will ask you to be merciful unto them lord and whatever there is the cancer of doubt the cancer of temper the mclean malignancy of unbelief just just listen how the prophet explains these problems the cancer of unbelief the mclean malignancy of unbelief the cancer of temper you can name them the the cancer of of slaughterfulness the temper the cancer of just being lukewarm that's been without purpose that cancer has been unprayerful lack of prayer it's a cancer me if i can accept it that hey brother there's a cancer here you need to shoot it out when is it going to go out along the road as we walk as we head that along around the corner when jesus is coming before we reach him there's going to be quite a steep drive there's even a 4x4 can drive there there's going to be a some some part of the road as we just before we meet him that is going to be tough that needs us to be fully armed and this is the time for us to make sure that every aspect of the kingdom is strengthened he prays here the prophet he says lord and i give them the holy ghost i give you the holy ghost fill their souls with your goodness baptize them into thy kingdom just now as they have raised their hands in the confession of their faith and asking thee o merciful god to do this for them he's praying for you and for me the prophet so i cannot overemphasize the importance of you as an individual in this kingdom when we understand how a kingdom functions we understand the importance of each one of us we understand our contribution we understand that a little weakness on the chain can cause a big problem so let us hold fast this is just to encourage you to say hey i might be at all hey i might be a little pinky hey i might be an insignificant or so-called small part ah you might be a domain it's a kind of tabernacle you might be a little break here on the corner we we don't even touch or see it and another one think that he's a handle by the door of this building then he's more important no every part is important without that part on that corner of that roof there's no handle the house is not complete so shakina i want to encourage you over there in video land i want to encourage you and say let us not our eyes be disillusioned let's not our eyes be taken from the main thing we want the kingdom of the lord to come and it has come let's protect it with everything we have let's protect it as the musicians come that kingdom has come it's already within you you cannot allow not one step out hallelujah may the lord bless you tonight i tried my best to just go eight just eight minutes above the hour may the lord bless you i'm improving hallelujah god bless you [Applause] because this is the message of the hour hallelujah so we're gonna sing a song and uh [Music] and then brother andy is going to help me because he is full of energy than i and then we are going to sing a song as we are reverend before the lord as we now come to the understanding of how important the body is i know this was just a refresher for you but we'll go and even tighten our shoelaces and we'll go and appreciate when we go through her time will go and cry as we cry we are happy we say lord thank you thank you for the tough time lord thank you because you said it that it will happen appreciate it lord that the enemy is targeting me like this i appreciate you lord that these things are happening to me because i'm your daughter i'm thankful to be part of that body while crying and worshiping the lord you know it's so wonderful to to worship the lord in cry and prayer because you mean it from your heart you are sincere and you are alone you are not showing off to anyone and you are doing it to the lord and the lord is there with you hugging you the more he comforts you the more you cry eventually you find that you are laughing you are not crying the pain you are crying the joy hallelujah so as we sing a song what song is that one sister send the power just now as we enter in the spirit of that song we are going to pray let's just sing it once twice and then we worship the lord closing our eyes just being reverent if you understand if you want to sit if you want to close your eyes do it for the glory of the lord just now [Music] just now [Music] unto the lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] it one more time [Music] [Music] just now [Music] lord we lift up our hands and our hearts before you father you know that there's nothing that i can say by myself that can actually help your people that is why lord we depend on you in everything that we do in everything that we say and i pray my father my god this evening that you take the words that was spoken lord and multiply it father like the day when you multiplied bread oh father god that was insignificant but you multiplied it further until it fed five thousand men [Music] and you multiplied my father my god the fish that was just insignificant and you fed the people i pray that you take your weight lord and lord multiplied and lord saturated in the lives and the hearts of your children and my father my god as we come now looking unto ourselves looking at what is happening around us looking at the rage you are looking at this the stalk of our ammunition father we realize that we need you more we need more of thee

heavenly father i pray for your bride across the face of the earth the mystic body that we hate about tonight brothers and sisters some at the moment maybe they are in a prison in china so maybe they are in north korea some maybe they are in russia some maybe are in ukraine so maybe oh my father my god they are in there in a life and a moment of despair in the prison of their own i pray my father that let your mystic body father god like that ark of noah may they come together in spirit lord that you can pitch us oh father god to be above the waters of the flood as you prepare to close the door of this ark i pray heavenly father let there be no loophole let your pride fulfill that which you saw at the beginning my savior my god we pray for our loved ones but the god fell our field we
