if you'd like to pick up your Bibles with me uh just a quick announcement just remember uh we're having the AGM here straight after service uh Brother Andy and and sister bronnie candy made sandwiches for the kids and maybe for some of the adults too to uh tide us over but um that's going to be directly after service um next so this weekend of the 20th we're going to have commun foot washing um I think at about 3:30 or 4:00 we're going to have we're going to start a bit earlier I think but the time I change so but yeah we're going to have that tomorrow uh next next Sunday just as a reminder but um if you'd like to go to Matthew Chapter 13 with me I want to uh yeah I'm I want to continue really where we're going where where we are at the end time uh I want to just leave the uh Genesis 24 just for a brief just just for a service but I I want to uh look into you know there's a uh yeah we'll read here the parable of the weed and the tears we just so in Matthew 13 and we'll start from verse 24 we'll just take the um uh we'll just take this here from 24 down to verse verse 30 CU we're in a gathering age and some you we'll be gathered somewhere we'll all be gathered somewhere doesn't matter how young or old we are we're going to be gathered somewhere so another Parable he put forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is liken unto a man which SED good seed in his field but while men slept his enemies came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also Al so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did thou not so good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tears and he said unto them an enemy has done this the servants said unto him wil thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay least while we gather up the tears ye root up also the wheat with them let them grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my B may the Lord bless his word you may be seated so um is that slideshow Brother Andy is that is that up and running uh yeah just the just warming up okay that's fine we don't really need it too soon um so we've been speaking of of you from Genesis 24 because we see there's a uniting there with with with re and alaza where God you alaza was was sent to get a bride for Isaac and we and we've seen very plainly in the scripture that that um you know we are that we are that Rebecca we are we are living out what what she lived as a shadow we are living out in its fullness and we have heard we have heard the alas of call there's no doubt about it that God is so vind God over Vindicated this message to cause the elect to see this is me doing it this is not William brandham doing it this is me doing it and and and he Vindicated it so much that you would know this is God speaking in an age where there's a multitude of voices and everyone has an opinion God has sent it's not his opinion it is thus sayith the Lord into the Earth that we can know this is God speaking and so we just read this here but I just want to I just put this emphasis on this here notice he says now he says but gather together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the weed into my Bon so we have seen that the true sign of the end time is where as the bride and Christ have become one that is the true sign of the end time but then there's also uh this Parable uh Jesus is saying here that first the tears must be bound for the burning and then but he says but gather the wheed into my bone and now so there's only one bone and we know that is Christ and that ultimate Gathering will be the meeting in the a that is the ultimate Gathering of the wheat but we see that first the tears must be bound and we can see he says here he says but in the um he says uh up here he says um wait I um I saw it in the script he says but let them grow together verse 30 until the until the Harvest and in the time of the Harvest I'll say to the Reapers now gather them and so we're in this we're in this harvest season so I don't know if this is going to work or not now I just want to go into this because prophecy th this scripture is is is being fulfilled right in front of us in this day and hour and and this is from the UN website I just want to show you that that the there's a squeeze that is coming that has already been happening for many years upon Israel but now what's happening is that Israel is is is being forced slowly and slowly they're being strangled until eventually they have to sign an agreement with the Vatican and then we understand by Daniel's propety uh uh uh prophecy that in the midst of the Great Tribulation now the vatican's going to break the deal and they're going to betray them and all these things are going to happen but there's a slow squeeze upon Israel that they'll find eventually the only way out now is to sign sign up with a very enemy that hates them the ancient enemy of the church is is that beast power and they have to actually sign an agreement with them just to survive so this is this is from the UN um UN website so the state of Palestinian flag is to flight the United Nation headquarters at Geneva um this is a adopting a resolution on the non-member Observer States and the only two non-member states in the UN is the Vatican and the Palestinian territories so this is just an excerpt from this I can send you the link he says in a discussion that began before the adoption and continued afterwards delegates considered various aspects of the resolution calling it a historic vote The Observer of the State of Palestine said that the general assembly had sent an important message to the Palestinian people at at a critical time while raising the flag would not end the OCC would not in the occupa this is the UN website raising and but they quoting this guy but but they're obviously supporting what he's saying he's saying raising the flag would not end the occupation so they're saying that Israel is occupying Palestine it would signify to the Palestinian people everywhere that the international community supported them because what happens is Israel is a part of the UN it's a it's a recognized country but the Palestinians are not a recognized Country and so what is moving towards now is that the Palestinians eventually will get statehood recognized by the UN this is what's going on and now when they and when they uh receive statehood they're on equal footing now with Israel and so what happens now is the UN they you know the Palestinians are trying to force the Israelis to go back to the borders that were before the 1967 war they you know there's a big push we want Israel must go back to the pr67 W you know borders because the UN acknowledged those borders you see so now when when the when the Palestinians get statehood there'll be a push now they must restore those original borders right and the only ones holding up the whole thing will be Israel you see so Israel it's been a you know it's been around for a while Israel is the one holding up peace that's how the world projects it Israel's it's not Palestinian it's it's Israel's the problem you see and this is fulfilling so this is just a map now the so in the pink is the countes that recognize the state of Palestine it's most of the world it's 60 it's basically 70% of the members of the United Nations recognize the state of Israel yeah and the Vatican recognized them as a state recently as well so it's already a majority now recognize Palestine is a should be a state yeah now remember the reason why there's this big turf war going on in the promised land is because God said to the Jews I give you the land I'm going to restore there's a prophecy maybe let's just go to Hosea chapter 6 and we're just going to read a prophecy there's this prophecy here what I'm I'm basically showing you this is where we are in the end time this is this is current event remember modern events are made clear by the prophecy so everything you see on the world stage is made clear by the prophecy that's right amen and that's why God had to send a Vindicated voice in this end time that we could know exactly what's going on you know I saw this clip on YouTube just a little bit last night I can't remember the Bible teacher's name but he was taking Revelations 11 and he said the two witnesses were the Old and New Testament and he said they are raid and sat cloth because it was under martydom and hardship you know that the Reformation came forth that was his and people were just swallowing it up I thought thank God for a voice thank God for Elijah to come amen and rebuild the altar so we can really worship God hallelujah thank you Lord amen otherwise we'd be staggering in darkness amen so Hosea chapter 6 and verse 1 says come and let us return unto the Lord for he has torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us after two days will he revive us and the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight now this was written over this was written in BC 780 according to my Bible and we know a day with the Lord is a thousand years so saying in the third day he will you he says after two days he will revive us and the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight and you see that these last you know recently you know you go back 200 years they begin to to be a ground swell of this we must return to our homeland speaking of the Jews there's a Zionist movement you know we must have a state of Israel what's happening this scripture now cuz this is over this is in the third 3,000 year you see where we are now you following me so this scripture is being fulfilled where a people he says Let Us return come let us return unto the Lord and remember the only way that Israel can really have fellowship with God is if they're in the promised land you know God always deal here always dealt with Abraham in the promised land he always deals with the Jews cuz that's their inheritance just like the only way God can deal with us is if we're in our inheritance if we're in Christ amen our Wilderness Journey God can do Mighty things for us but it's when we cross the Jordan when and that Jordan is a death the self if you're willing to die I mean to go into your inheritance that's where God really wants to speak to you and so God now he's so this is this scripture this day the scripture is being fulfilled amen so if this is now the prophecy of God saying that the people will be stirred and they will return to their land then Satan is going to do everything he can to dislodge the people and he's going to try and invalidate their right to be there right you see so this big Turf War now is as we have you know Ishmael and Isaac you know their their lineages are fighting fighting it out to see who really the promised land belongs to it belongs to Isaac's people whether the world will recognize it or not it is it is the Jewish people they have a right to be there and so we have this big you know we have this big stir going on and the reason that the UN is is jumping on the bandwagon is because the UN you know this is not conspiracy theory we'll read in the Book of Revelation the last World power the only world power there is is is the Vatican it's in the scripture the last willpower there is is the Vatican so they are governing world events so whatever the UN is trying to do it is working towards their ends amen is working towards what they want and we also have if we go to Daniel chap 11 we'll just read the last part of Daniel chapter 11 because Daniel chap 11 he you know Daniel sees in a slightly greater detail really what is what is happening down from from uh you know you see Alexander the Great in there and it continues on down it continues on down into this into this end time and the because the Catholic Church they know they started in Jerusalem they want Jerusalem Rome is not their original place but they believe and they they recognize their Homeland is really Jerusalem so they want the holy sites they want to control the holy sites there in Israel and we can see this here in in Daniel 11 if we go just to the last verse of Daniel 11 because it's quite a long verse and there's many many things that are spoken about about um but now we'll just read the last last uh last two verses here but this is speaking about the so it goes from if you read Daniel 11 in the start of the verse it speaks about Darius the me and then it speaks about the king that you know he stir up the realm of Greece Grecia which is Alexander the Great and then so so so this is placed in time and then it's from then and then how Alexander the Great's Kingdom splits up it continues all the way down into the end time this is this chapter so if we come down to the end of the chapter so verse 44 but but Tidings out of the East and out of the North shall trouble him therefore um he shall go forth with great Fury to destroy into Ally to make uh to make away many he shall plant the Tabernacles of his Palace so this is this speaking of this beast power he shall plant the Tabernacles of his Palace between the Seas and the glorious holy mountain now where's that there's only one glorious holy mountain I mean that's in Israel yeah there's only one Holy Mountain that's recognized in the Bible which is which is in Israel yet he shall come to his end and None Shall help him so this is his end goal he wants the pope you know that whole be system wants to set themselves up there in Israel they want the holy places and we can see this here that it says he shall plant the Tabernacle of his Palace between the SE in the glorious holy mountain so he's going to achieve it in some way yeah now how does he how does he how does he work that out he turns the world against Israel and he squeezes them so they have to give in to survive now so and then also we have this scripture here in Zechariah Chapter 12 because this is being fulfilled the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel sayith the Lord who stretched forth the heavens and layth the foundation of the earth and forth the spirit of man within him behold I'll make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in The Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem now you think of a Siege you think of walls you think of Defense yeah now when I now this is just me have they not built walls in Israel to keep the Palestinians out are they not being attacked from Gaza and Rockets being fired what does that constitute it's a Siege to me it's a Siege amen the enemy said as you know cuz it's not a a Siege as as as as you lay you know you surround your enemy and you don't just do it all out of salt but gradually you fire something in you try and wear him down and you try to find his weak points they dig tunnels under they do all kinds of things it's a Siege they' built Jerusalem y Israel's put walls up like they never have before to separate at the West Bank and all these things now that's just me but that's how I see it I might be wrong but that's how I see it that behold now and in that day I'll make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the Earth shall be gathered together what against it this scripture is being fulfilled this has been being fulfilled for a long time amen Jerusalem is a bir burden every president I must make peace we must make peace it's a burden to the whole world how can we answer the the the problem you know there in the Middle East it's not Isis and all these things that the world really cares about it's Israel and Jerusalem and the Palestinians and you know this is the burden that the world has and it says all it says a burnis some stone for all people you look at this country they've got got a seat in the security Council in the UN what do they want to try and fix they want to try and fix this it's and we're on the other side of the earth you know not even it doesn't really affect us but it's become a burden amen the word of the Lord is perfect amen this is what's going on the whole Jerusalem is a burden now there's a gathering going on this is all part of the Gathering now what I now let's just go to Revelations chapter 13 just quickly because I want to read a few things here and then I'm going to show you how it's been lived out I'm going to show you how it's been lived out because it's incredible when you when you look at the you know from from you know from missusa Street and then around the same time you have you have you know you have brother Bam's commissioned take the gift of healing to the Earth Elijah is being commissioned by the angel of the Lord to basically go out attract the attention of the bride and begin to gather the bride then you have the World Council of churches really has its first meeting and then you have the uh you have a you have Israel for the first time for over 2,000 years they declared themselves a Sovereign Nation all at the end of the all at the end of the 1940s all these same events are going on and it's it's very significant because in the time of the Harvest he says I'll bind the tears first for the burning but then I'll gather the wheat and so he sends he sends Elijah now to gather the wheat and he stirs up he stirs up Europe now and brother baram and maybe we say it too easily but he says that the Holocaust and World War II was the tender hand of Jehovah to drive the Jews back into their Homeland and we understand from reading the seals that that all those Jews that died on the Holocaust were give white robes amen think of it amen but Prophet says it's the tender hand of Jehovah you Tred telling that to people who who survived that thing and still have the still have the you the uh you know the uh number and stuff you know they prison of it try telling that to one of those Jews it was just a tender hand of your God that caused all this to happen that's what the prophet said it was so you have now this is all happening to drive the Jews back into their Homeland because out of those ones and out of the others that will come later 144,000 of them are going to be gathered that's why that's why the Devils roaring against that place is because he knows in the scripture there's 144,000 elected Jews they're going to receive the same God that we know am Hallelujah and they and they're going to be there and they have to be there so the devil tries all he can to try and stop that being fulfilled and so we have that going on you have the World Council of churches forming itself and we'll read in the scripture that that thing is the vehicle and America is the vehicle that the devil uses to swing the whole of the Christian Christendom into into Rome again swings the whole thing back in and then you have Elijah that's come to call out elected bride amen hallelujah all these things are sent to the Earth at the same time scriptures being fulfilled it's incredible amen amen so let's just go I want to Glory Hallelujah now just to save time thank you just to save time I'm sure you're familiar all all with this but Revelations 13: 1 down to verse 10 but let's just read this let's just go through it just just just very quickly remember this is all symbolic and this first part of this chapter is speaking of of this Roman power and Daniel sees it when he sees the four creatures and the last creature was the most diverse as the others it was part of all of the first three were merged into the fourth one and this was the world power the Roman power and that is the only will power to the time of the end and John sees the same creature now and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea now remember the sea we we understand from The Book of Revelation it's peoples multitudes tongues and Nations so this power is raising up out of a populated part of the earth which we understand is Europe having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the names of blasphemy or yeah and the Beast which I saw was like now was like unto a leopard and his feet were like the feet of a bear and his mouth is the mouth of a lion now if you go back into Daniel when you read about the first three world powers one's a lion one's a leopard and one's a bear that's the anointings is what they look like so this fourth one is a bit of all that mixed together and his mouth his mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority say the Devil Himself giving this power giving this thing his power and his seat and his great Authority this last World system and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after to the Beast now this happened when Pagan Rome changed to paple Rome yeah and if you go on to church history we have emperor Constantine is about to come to a very important battle and he has a Visionary dream of of a cross he says with this sign you shall conquer and he told the soldiers to paint the paint the symbol on his Shi on their Shields they won the battle and then what happened is after that because he was a political man and what was happening is Christianity was Rising up in his Empire and was causing great Strife between the old religions and the new what he did is he made a compromise and he took he took parts of Christianity and he took the Pagan old worship and he merged them together to make the people happy that's why we we celebrate Christmas on the 25th of December which is the shortest day in the your your shortest day in the northern hemisphere it's the son God's birthday traditionally but now it's the done of God's birthday so and Easter and all these different things they just they just took the Pagan Traditions rebranded them it's still the same thing and then just gave it to the people and they were happy that's why you have father son Holy Ghost three gods and the Pagan Traditions were more than one God polytheism yeah and so he did that now politically to to keep power in his Empire and that's when the p i Pagan Rome like the Roman Empire the legion you you the legions and all these things they would changed now so now instead of a physical power in that way it was a religious power but it was still the world power at the end and then you can see from then on you can see the Pope the Catholic church was driving you know driving politics in Europe that's why you see you know you go back you go back in the Reformation days the Cardinals were like the most powerful man in a country yeah and they were they were like the Prime Minister yeah they were a prime minister in a country that's like Henry VII he had to kill his Cardinal you know to do whatever he wanted to do marry more wives and all these different things that power had to be broken yeah imagine that if if you know a prime minister of a country is really working for someone else his first Allegiance isn't to the country isn't to the king it's to another guy he's not going to he's going to he's pushing he's pushing an influence on an agenda which is not the king's agenda that's Rome's agenda you see and so this power was changed now and it says and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him and you can see in you you can see in world history you can see you know when the Ottoman Empire was coming up and all these different things and the and the you know there was the Holy League of the of the Protestants and the Catholics came together to fight the Ottoman Empire they you know Ottoman Empire was going to take Vienna which is a very important city in Europe and they and they broke the siege they defeated the Ottomans they pushed them back ultimately they could say who could make war with this power no one could make war with it amen you can see how you know he he began to govern The Whole World's events now and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given onto him to continue 40 and2 months and he opened his mouth and blessed me against God to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and then that dwell in heaven I'm just I'm just skipping over a lot of these things but and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and the power was given unto him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations now these Saints here maybe we just drop this in but but these saints that he had he was given to make war with the Saints and to overcome them that is remember a Saints is a Sanctified one someone who's come to sanctification is a saint it doesn't mean their Spirit fill so the so the ones so the right you know the fullest virgin that goes into the tribulation they are Saints yeah but they didn't have oil in their lamps they didn't have the Holy Ghost in them in their vessels to be taken into the wedding supper y they didn't have they were Sanctified like the you know the foolish virgin the only difference between the foolish virgin and the wise virgin was that one had oil one had really partaken of the rivers of life one one actually already one was thirsting the fullest version was still thirsting the Wise One know Jesus said out of you will flow rivers of Living Water so there was there was a life being lived being poured out of the wives that the foolish didn't have amen this gospel is a life of power amen amen it is a life of power and there's something when when you come and you really meet him you don't thirst like you did before you were you know before you ever met him you thirsted you hungry you looking for something and that's why you know people I ended up in a barro I ended up making home I ended up playing all kinds of video games and watching all kinds of movies and listening to all kinds of music and all kinds of sports and all these things cuz I was thirsty yeah but one day I met Jesus Glory all those things died Hallelujah and now I don't thirst like that anymore but there's people you could sit even here this morning and still thirst amen quench that thirst amen hallelujah that's right and so the ones that really have become one with him have the oil they're going up amen but the ones who don't have the oil they're staying here that's right and that's why it says now that the it was given to him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them because um let's just jump back into the Book of Daniel I want to show you that there's these two groups here because we do not you know this tribulation that everyone is worried about the bride doesn't see it in its fullness we begin to feel its effect sure but we you know we're out of here hallelujah now Daniel chapter 7 em we read here now'll find it he says here let's just start reading from verse 9 I beheld to the Thrones were cast down the Ancient of Days did sit whose garments were white as snow and the hair of his head was was like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him that's the bride and 10,000 time 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books are open and I beheld then because the voice of the great words which the horn spake which is the enemy I beheld even till the Beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the Burning Flame as concering the rest of the Beast they had their Dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season in a time now uh yes here so we go down to verse 18 now he says uh let's just read from verse 15 we'll just read it I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and the vision of my head troubled me I came near unto one of them that stood by I asked the truth of all this so he told me to made me know the interpretation of the things these great beasts which are four are Four Kings which shall rise out of the earth now watch this but the Saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever so that's one group then I would know the truth of the fourth Beast which is diverse from all the others exceedingly Dreadful whose teeth were of iron his nails of brass which devoured break in pieces and stamped the residue with his feet and of the 10 horns which were in his head and of the other which came up and before whom three fell even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake very great things those look was more Stout than his fellows now that's that is describing what we read in Revelations 13 okay so don't just just just stick with me and I beheld and the same horn made war with the Saints and prevailed against them until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given to the Saints of the most high and the time came that the Saints possessed the Kingdom so there's one group here we read in verse 18 but the Saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even even forever but then there's another group here where that same horn made's war with the Saints and prevailed against them how can that be well what it is basically it is it is the the ones in verse 18 is the bride that goes up and the ones now here we have in verse 21 and then verse 22 is the great white Throne judgment they receed the kingdom after the great white Throne judgment because before that this beast power makes war with them and overcomes them that's the foolish virsion going into to the tribulation are you're following me so so there's the two groups are described them now and then even if we go down to verse 25 you know he's speaking of the same thing and he shall speak great words against the most high and wear out the Saints of the most high and think to change times and laws that they shall be given into his hand into a time and a times and a dividing a time but the Judgment shall sit and they shall take away his dominion and consume and to destroy it until the end and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the Kingdom Under the whole Heaven shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and all Dominion Shall Serve and Obey him so again this is repeated it says that this this power will make war against yeah he shall wear out the Saints of the most high and think that change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and a dividing of time so time is one times is two dividing time is a half it's three and a half years so so during that Great Tribulation time he'll He he'll he'll change everything like this amen yeah right so now this so the bride hey the bride that's why I Rejoice the bride goes up we don't see these things hallelujah thank you Lord amen now let's just go if if you still got Revelations 13 handy we'll just go back there because I want to go into these slides but I need to lay this to show you that these events that I've just picked up uh uh very significant because it's prophecy being fulfilled you know people are thinking well we've got to see certain things happen and this has got to happen first and it's already happened we are we are so at the end friends we are right we are right there amen hallelujah amen so now um uh uh so eight so so verse eight of of Revelation 13 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship her who's that the Beast the dragon whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him here do G he says all that's a lot of people you think seven billion upon the Earth he says all whose names are not written the land's Book of Life shall worship him right well will they all become Catholic no they don't need to become Catholic they don't even need to become Christians right amen this this enemy is a multi-headed Hydra right amen and its head can be religion its head can be Sports its head can be Hollywood it head can be your job its head can be just wanting your know Home Improvement right whatever your God whatever you make as a God you can trace that that's not Christ you can trace it back to that beast power right hallelujah amen amen so you don't just look at the head of the thing you say what is driving that thing what drives people to be so busy and want to just you know Home Improvement and wanting to be I need a new car I need a b a car I need a bigger house I need to I I want to go on holiday over here and they and they strive and they give themselves and hey all those things are good there's nothing evil with wanting a new car and wanting a bigger house and wanting to go on holiday all those things are perfectly fine but if it becomes your main point it becomes the number one in your life oh I need to I want to get a promotion there's nothing wrong with working as unto the Lord and want all those things are fine but but when it becomes first in your life that is that is that is the problem nothing wrong with playing Sport and kicking a ball around whatever but when it becomes first in your life I think I've told this before but I'll tell it again when I was seven you know I loved cricket cricket cricket was me before I got into sailing cricket was me and I remember the semifinal of the 1992 World Cup Cricket World Cup and New Zealand lost to park Pakistan and I was I cried I I cried like a baby my whole world had been destroyed I was I was really upset about it I was seven but here my heroes Danny Morrison and Martin Crow and all these great ones I wanted to bowl like Danny Morrison Hallelujah this is me I was but I was caught up and now my heroes had been defeated and my life was over you think that's silly not to a seven-year-old boy it's not silly but you see men grows up and they still that seven-year-old boy and they still worship the god of sports nothing wrong with sport play sport but when it becomes first place it's bad it's wrong it's evil amen so now it says that all shall worship Him people say how do I know I'm predestinated what are you worshiping it doesn't say them that are written on the Lamb's Book of Life shall worship him those who are not written when that Prophet stood here and he preached preached you know when the lamb took the book and then he began to preach with the opening of the seals you are part of that you that book of redemption that was taken you're part of that book all the names of the elected ones are in that book and then so when when the lamb took the book and was given to a prophet to to break the mysteries of God to a people he was by preaching those sermons now he was calling the names in the book amen what did he say he never said you know you can't find Ben glowing in the search thing that's that's not that it's it's when something in you says that's me amen this message is for me he's called me out what is that that's God calling your name I want God to speak to me if if this message has spoken to you like nothing else that is God calling your name and that proves your names in the book amen amen cuz here's one here's one saying now the wedding supper is so many people whether we like or not there's places and there's names just like you go to a feast someone who's on to it they they they place the guests and you know like you have a wedding reception there there's place names and this is my seat I'm sitting at this table I can't sit at this you it's all been arranged times that by 100 billion infinity and that's how does the great wedding supper of the Lamb there's names there's names there and everyone has to be there whose name is there am and that's why God sent God sent the friend of the bridegroom that was revealing the bridegroom so he sent an alasar and he had the he had the reception list he had the ones who were meant to be there amen and he and he and he and the Word was open and he began to preach he's preaching the the the invitation glory and then you heard that invitation because your name's on the register am me your name's in the book of names and that's why you respond and say yes that's me because your name's been called out of the book Glory hallelujah amen and that's why it says that only those who are not written in the Book of Life shall worship Him amen that's why we're the most privileged people hallelujah amen amen sorry I got to stay up my subject here amen now we go down here if any man have an ear let him here he that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity he that kill us with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the Saints now we have another we have another character coming upon the scene now and I beheld another Beast coming out of the earth so not out of the sea out of the Earth this is a place where there's not a great multitude of people there's a power coming out of the earth and he had two um out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon now this is a world power coming on the scene and this so a lamb is is freedom of religion amen pure religion so when America was founded the Puritans founded America and they came to flee the persecution that was going on in the old world and they came to the new because they wanted freedom of of worship and that's what America was founded upon freedom of worship and so that power came out of the so sure the Native Americans were there but they Wen it wasn't a great densely popular place like Europe was amen so came out of the Earth where there's not many people and you notice here now he had two horns which is ecclesiastical and and and civil kind of power like a lamb and he spake as a dragon now we understand when a lamb is born he doesn't have horns I've never you know I've you know I've helped friends dock lamb tals hundreds of them I never saw one with horns because it's just a baby but when it grows into an adult Ram then it's when the horns grow amen so we've seen America is over what 200 odd years I don't know how old but but it's a mature country amen even though it hasn't been here relatively that long it's a mature country it has history it has culture it has identity amen so it's a mature country so it says now he had two horns like a lamb so he's not speaking of a just a baby lamb anymore but it's a it's a ram it's a a mature a mature power you following me he says when he has these now he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon so he's not speaking so to speak as someone it's I'm I'm repeating what's already been spoken yeah so if I want to speak as Andy I just quote Andy I'm speaking as Andy you see so now for him to speak as a dragon it's not a lamb speaking anymore but he's repeating what a dragon is saying yeah that's right yep he is repeating what a dragon is saying he's repeating what the Vatican is saying you go back a 100 years you I think it was yeah I might be wrong on the name but I think it was Teddy Roosevelt he went to go see the pope but he was told when you see the pope you got to kiss his ring and you got to basically bow down he says no it's off they would never they would never have you know they would never have audiences like they do and like they're about to have later this month with with the Pope going to America 100 years ago would never have happened right would never have happen and so it's only been since see Kennedy came in and brother Ram says this this country is going to make the greatest mistake it's ever made by voting in a Catholic President and they made that mistake so now what happened is that enemy power that they fled to find to to found that country they've married themselves back into it by actually placing it in charge of the whole country you take the Supreme Court they're either Catholic judges or the Jewish there's no Protestants on the Supreme Court anymore and a Supreme Court Judge is there basically till he drops dead and they write the laws they they you know they're the Supreme that's the Supreme Judicial System of the whole country and it's Jewish or Catholic amen this is prophet and he spake as a dragon well how does all this has to come into place for now for him to speak as the dragon you know and then you see you know you take uh you know you take the you know the last elections both vice presidents were Catholic people there's all this going on all the Mexicans coming in Catholic people all this going on what's Happening Catholicism has Taking Over America amen this scripture is being fulfilled you may never recognize y oh when's this all going to happen it's already happened the hour is a lot later than we we think and it says now and he excises all the power of the first Beast before him and cause the Earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed so this power now the the intent of this power now is to cause everyone to come back to the Vatican and worship it and he did great wonders so he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth and the sight of men and he and he deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he have power to do in the side of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live so now this power is instrumental because this image to the Beast that is the World Council of churches that's what it is in the scripture and so this F so this Beast is actually instrumental now and causing this thing to be formed this image to the Beast that all the world now would be gathered back into Rome Hallelujah I say praise the Lord because this word must be fulfilled am fulfill your word oh God that's all I say amen and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause as many as should not worship the image of the Beast should be killed then remember that's in the Great Tribulation and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name here is W wisdom excuse me let that ha understanding count the number of the Beast for it is the number of a man and his number is is 603 sc6 now so he's saying here that he so this image now would cause the people to receive a mark in their hand right hand or their forehead now in the in the in the Book of Revelation those who are sealed with the Holy Ghost is sealed in their forehead so what this is now is your hand to be marked in your hand is what you do and in your forehead is your Doctrine amen so so people can be sealed either way they can give to it sympathize with it or they can be take false religion and be marked that way now we go back the time of isusa Street America and the Vatican were PS apart but then there's been a great and the World Council churches wasn't even here and now there's been a great big shift where all have come together and this scripture is being being lived out and so what happens now is there has to be because remember when when the Book of Revelations in chapter 17 it calls it calls Rome says it says that she's the mother of harlots this this church system is a mother so it's got children it's got it's got It's got daughter denominations so what has to happen now is that all these ones remember it's a binding the tears have to be bound so there has to be a gathering now of mom and daughters have to be gathered all back together so there has to be a vehicle now that that Satan uses to swing the people back into row now this begin to happen when brother remember Elijah when Elijah was upon the Earth you know Jezebel was trying to bind the people under a de Bale worship and then so there was there was this was going on but Elijah was trying to you know that's reason he called the Mount Caramel Showdown is the people would come out of that thing and they would worship the true and living God and then so you come now and this man this is this is David David johanes Jus or however you say it he's a South African born Pentecostal Minister brother Brown speaks of this man he is considered one of the main founders of the charismatic movement in which the Pentecostal experience by baptism with the Holy Spirit spread to non-pentecostal churches worldwide so now there's okay jup entitled his autobiography the spirit made me go as he believed God had commanded him to take the Pentecostal message to other denominations and in particular the World Council of churches recounting a meeting with 24 ecumenical leaders in Connecticut dupus wrote this is his words I could remember days when I wish I would have set my eyes upon such a men to denounce their the ology and pray the Judgment of God was upon them for what I considered their heresies and false doctrines after a few intro um introductory words I suddenly felt a warm glow come over me I knew this was the Holy Spirit taking over but what was he doing to me instead of a old harsh Spirit of criticism and condemnation of my heart I now felt such a love and compassion for these ecclesiastical leaders that I'd rather have died for them than past sentence upon them now he's a contemporary of brother Bram brother bram's Ministry it says in Revelations 18 W it says now he says I heard another voice he says and there after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great has fallen has fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful birth for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are wax Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not her plagues so there's a voice that has come upon the Earth is that they calling out say come out of her so that is the call of the Hour come out of these religions and come into Christ that you be not you know that you are not burnt with her basically but then now here's another man who's actually once he was against once he was against that kind of thing ecumenical moves but then something happens to him at this meeting where his whole his whole outlook has changed he's saying now they're my brothers that's not that is not that is not God if a Vindicator voice says come out of her my people and another voice says bind in with them which one are you going to take amen so this man was was called Mr Pentecost and he after this now he swung the whole church into Babylon he swung the Pentecostal move into Babylon what's happening tears are being bound Hallelujah tears are being bound that's right see if he really had love and compassion for them he would have said come out of that stuff forsake that stuff and come into Christ that's what he would have told them cuz that's what love and compassion does is don't go that way that ways death but his eternal life receive it amen that's that is hey if you want to get scratchy get scratchy I mean go fishing throw out something if people nibble give them a bit more if they don't nibble just just let it go how can I tell them just throw out something throw something out and see what happens and and if there's a response throw out a bit more you don't have to give them the whole thing just a little bit by little bit hey Jesus you know with the woman at the well he didn't say he didn't immediately say I'm the Messiah yeah they talked about the wells and real worship you know they slowly hone down then finally says he that speaks to thee am he you know I that speak to the am he so so so he started just just give me a drink and then the conversation went on he didn't throw it all out there in the initial statement that's right he just laid he just gave it a little bit then she responded then he responded again then she responded then finally it came came down and he he revealed who he was just give a little bit but I don't know how to you there can be a thing hey you've got you know the greatest treasure on the earth how do you give it to people just give a little bit and then a little bit more and just see and just see how they respond to it amen now so he now this is this is Brother bar speaking the souls are in prison he say see what happened here a week ago in the city the Faith Lutheran minister invited the Catholic priest of the Sacred Heart to come up and preach for him and he did and the Faith Lutheran minister went down to the Catholic priest and preached for him now remember the lutherans came out of the Catholic church amen and Martin Luther didn't want to start a new church he wanted to fix the one he's in and then because they wouldn't change they kicked him out and so he had to start something new so this would never have happened this you know Martin Luther would be rolling in his grave if he saw what the lutherans had done yeah amen right and then um the Council of churches over here now that's meeting in Rome this circular letter that my good friend David dupus when I sat there and cried to him about in 40 Mile Creek not long ago not realizing he swung the church right into Babylon wow when everybody's saying oh all the churches are going to be one now yeah I know that just exactly that's wrote in my book of Prophecy 1933 it would take place why don't you realize that Satan uniting together the Bible says that and after a little bit just after a while as soon as they become one then the inter denominational finished see there'll be your mark of the beast rise see see he's saying these things because this David youus this is this was in um this was before 1963 when he had this meeting yeah and then so he was swinging the people and then so and then and then a sermon after this brother R said I shouldn't have called his name he says normally I don't call names and he said I'm sorry I didn't mean to call but he's saying he he was so grieved because he didn't realize that he'd swung the church right into Babylon remember the image will cause the whole world to worship the Beast and now so this is him this is davidus this is Pope John the uh Pope Paul the 6 and some various delegates and so on and this was this was I think in the early 70s and what happened was is that in the SE I think other the late 60s or early 70s is the pope asked David dupus now to start a Interfaith dialogue with the Pentecostals even more and so the Vatican actually used him as a vehicle to swing the church under under her influence amen this is scripture being lived out you say well it's just a nice photo they have a meeting this is scripture being lived out amen we don't want to just take it you know nothing more than that now he says this and this lean not into your own understanding see I was up there um so so we was up there in Finland little boy was raised from the dead they stood from Russian soldiers at attention they said we'll receive a God that can raise up the dead we had made denominations schools buildings and fail to do what Jesus told us to do was preach the gospel we tried to educate the world he he never said educate the world um that the uh he's that's educated shall be saved you've got to be born again filled with the spirit that's the reason we have so miserably found see we've got the wealth we've got the thing now what will happen and when this church the World Council of churches goes together can't you see who's going to do the leading can't you Methodist Presbyterians understand that the rest of you even to Pentecostals you say you're not going in you'll either go in or you'll bust up the denomination you'll you'll do one or the other that's right before you you've got to do it it's a forcing the mark of the beast that's what it is exactly so he says you'll either go in he says you will go in because back then there was there was still D say we we we will not join this thing and they went right in it all the same here's Elijah see these things that he says he's telling us this is this is this is what's happening this is where we are he says you will go in or you'll break up your denomination they can't break up the denomination cuz the spirit in that thing is an organization amen and you've never scen it's a people always leave a church system they never actually change the whole thing that God can work with them again you you know that's why there's a multitude of denominations today is because there's a syst like the Catholic church with the Lutheran the Catholic chur Chang the Lutheran left Wesley came out of the Anglican Church Pentecostals came out of their denominations all the way down through because the system wasn't willing to change now he says this he says now remember all right I predict this is in 1962 this in 62 remember the world was very different back then the world was very different but I'm I'm showing you these things is because the prophet prophesied these things would happen yeah so he and he's telling us this is what's going on now remember I predicted the two denominational groups Pentecostal and the Evangelical groups will work together in a denom ation will unite themselves together and will become a member all of them of the Federation of the Council of churches or the Council of churches they already belong to it all of them and there and there will become through them a forcing or a boycott that'll stop everything but what belongs to that Union of churches he says that's he says the Bible said there would be a boycott even to such a way would cause people not to buy or sell unless theyve received this the mark of the beast which is romanism and and the image of the Beast which is protestantism that the image the Beast had the Power Authority to give the image life to speak and it did and that's the confederation of churches when they Confederate themselves together now there's many young people here I don't know Jesus may come this afternoon he may come next year I don't know when he'll be coming but remember if I don't live to see that day of his coming which I hope I will and somehow believe I will now if I do not see it do not let this word depart from your ears and your hearts just remember I speak in the name of the Lord now I believe with all my heart there's such a way it'll wind up there'll be a union of boycott all such places as this here will be closed down and you'll not be able to speak unless you've got a permission or a license from this Federation of churches to hold a service it's almost it shows it does that even now in the denomination you take you take like brother Greg down in Christ Church preaching in the prisons of course he's not part of the will Council of churches it came to a point where they kicked him out there was a boycott in the prison he wasn't allowed to minister to the prisoners anymore amen you take going into hospitals you got to be part of the chapel group otherwise you can't do it what's happening there's a boyot is a union unless you're part of the Union you can't do it amen I tell you what friends we've been told if you wonder what's going on you get into this word you get into this word and you'll find out what's going on hallelujah we're not blind we're not in darkness we're not groping in darkness we have seen the light I Saw The Light Hallelujah glory amen we're free people now this is from Godless evil age I'm just going to throw this thing that chose who's the head of it it's Satan in the form of a Superman person of knowledge a super knowledge he knows more than all the rest of them no matter what the word says he's got his own interpretation to it see the interpretation for this evil age notice has plans to build a super denominational Church the World Council church is here a super denomination so that all the world will worship Him the Beast under the name of United Christianity amen would you like to read that in the Bible revelations 1336 and 8 we just read it as a modern P Tower of Babel don't you remember how that Nimrod that hypocrit built this big tower and made all the other little cities pay tribute to it Babel and Babel is a the same thing it just changes its names as it comes on up it's Rome now is Babylon and the whole world's bought to Babylon and it's broughten by the World Council of churches we just read that Revelations 1 we just read that which will make every one of them bow to her and you took the mark of the beast not known what you doing but those who are elected will hear the word and come out of it amen hallelujah hallelujah amen Jesus now let's go on to some people people now I'm sure you've I'll send you the link of the video If you haven't seen this remember if you've seen the video Tony Palmer here this bishop here who's actually a Episcopalian Bishop but part of the Interfaith dialogue he was a good friends of Pope Francis before he became Pope Francis and then what happens is they have a meeting and then because he's an Interfaith man he's about to go to a a pastor's meeting run by Kenneth Copeland now these are heavies these are big people in the world and I'll show you how big they are and then you remember he he he gives an address and he reads Malachi 4 but turning the hearts of the fathers to the children hearts of children to the fathers he said now this is I and he says I come in the spirit of Elijah to bring reconciliation that's not the spirit of Elijah RH know the spirit of Elijah IO reconciles God and man amen hallelujah amen and then he he he he already recorded a video message of of the Pope who who's seen this clip yeah who's seen this clip okay I'll send you a link if you haven't seen it and then you know the Pope says you know we've all done wrong we've all sinned you know but we're brothers now this man represents a system that murdered 68 million people that's right and he's saying we've all done wrong 68 million Souls because they would not bow to his religion he says we've all done wrong we've all sinned we've all short know fell you know come short of the glory of God but we're brothers and he's basically giving a you know giving a arms of Fellowship out to you know out to the out to the uh charismatic move remember the Pentecostal move morph into the charismatic move and then Tony Palmer says that the uh you know the Lutheran had already signed a declaration of understanding with the Vatican you know saying about the you know just shall live by faith and all all these things they made a they made a Reconciliation and he says that the methodists have done the same notice how he identifies the moves you identifies the moves that were birthed under the church age Messengers identifies Luther there in Sardis and then and then Wesley and Philadelphia you he identifies these main moves and he B and and he says he says they've stopped protesting he says the Protestant error is over it's finished he says have you have you ended it too he says in a manner of words and then so he says pray for us he you know he asked them all to pray for us we'll pray for you and then he gets up and says Heaven is thrilled over this there's a you know monumentous occasions going on Heaven is thrilled I Say No Heaven is not thrilled over this amen this is the B remember the tears must be bound amen that's right how do you bind people spiritually you preach a word the the true word of God binds you to Christ you become one with him when Peter was preaching in cornelius's house says well yet Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them so he was preaching the word and they received that by faith and it caused them to become United with Christ so how do you bind tears you take scripture and you preach a perverted satanic gospel in the name of Jesus though and it doesn't bind the people the Christ it binds themselves say for the burning that's pretty strong but that's just how it is that's right um so then they all prayed for him and basically they accepted his uh you know his his invitation for Brotherhood and then so that was before this meeting in the Vatican and then now they all go and they have a meeting with Pope France uh Pope Pope Francis here this is after that video now we're just going to go through these people these are these are powerful people in the world of Christianity now let's take we'll just take some names so John uh John and Carol Arn it here on the left hand side so their church was the one where the Toronto blessing remember the Toronto blessing in 94 the you know the Laughing Revival and all these things and these these unscriptural manifestations of what they call was the Holy Ghost have you seen it yeah they are the pastors of that church with that first fell in Toronto so here's so this is how deceptive the devil is he puts forward what he calls a church and he claims now that this is God moving and remember we have the prophecy of false anointed ones at the end time brother Braham when he goes into that sermon you hear at the beginning he says now I'm going to speak about prophecy so when he's preaching that sermon he says that whole sermon is actually prophecy amen and that sermon is more alive today than it was when he preached it that's right false so people can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost but the vessel is false and the vessel's objective is to swing the people not into Christ but swing them into Babel you look at balam anointed prophet of God but he was a false prophet but this he actually prophesied true things but his intent wasn't to wasn't to help Moses and what God was doing when when God was working with them his intent was to swing the people to be cursed by God and when he couldn't curse them he caused them to become one with Moab go read about it Numbers 22 to 25 that was his intent and that is a false a false prophet swings the people to become United with the wrong thing yeah and so and then this guy Brian still is the global Ambassador for the world Evangelical Alliance the global Association which represents some 600 million Evangelical Protestants now remember when a head of something does something everyone underneath that head is is affected by that man's decision so by him going he is uniting whether they recogn he the people that attribute themselves to that system he's uniting them to Babylon amen right this guy Thomas uh T Cliff he was the Secretary General for the world of um Evangelical Alliance from 2005 2014 um this these two here James and bny Robinson were American tell evangelist and of course Tony P was the bishop who caused all these things to be but you just think six 600 million Souls this man he's not a small fish amen These Guys these guys have churches International churches they're not small fish either these are there a there's a serious delegation that's going here to do all these things and now well I just want to skip forward a bit and then you have now after this after this you have W uh Rick Warren here who wrote The Purpose Driven Life and all these things and then you have Joel ostein here these guys you go to Manor Bookshop these guys have influenced Christianity worldwide yeah These Guys these guys are basically household names in in a lot of societies when it comes to Christendom he went he went to I'll just I'll just come back to this was yeah so Rick Warren here he spoke at the Vatican uh biblical meeting of marriage so Warren joined leaders from 23 countries and in religion invited by Pope Francis at the kickoff Monday to the complimentary man and woman and uh International uh Clum it's great to be here with leaders from different streams of Christianity from all over the world Warren said from the Vatican on Monday although we've had some have some differences we all love Jesus pardon me and we all want marriage and families to be healthy and strong so we all love Jesus what Jesus are they referring to what Jesus Remember in the the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God and that word became flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus is his word so what you know what Jesus do do they all love um upon meeting Pope Francis warranted up close you can feel the humility and compassion that others see from afar look at this here um participants included Southern Baptist evangelic even evangelist russal Mo as well as Muslim Jewish and latterday Saint Representatives now these guys the Mormons they consider themselves totally separate really from from you know the rest of Christianity but you see theyve sent representatives to these things what's happening there's a dialogue has begun what's happening tears are being bound right Muslim Jewish all kinds of all the tears are being bound I'm just I'm just showing you these things because we're at the end of all things now and then Joel oin uh you know he went there as well and he was incredibly moved by the whole experience he said the Pope's a wonderful man and all these things he is a household these guys are household names they're teaching influences you know you go to any church out here and they will know who you're talking about when you reference these guys amen and there their their teachings have influenced the world and the intent of that is to you we you read Revelations 13 that calls all and the image of the Beast will worship you caus all to worship the Beast so all all of this is an intent that this system receives worship amen tears are being bound now we'll go back okay this is from the church age book this is in 1965 this was published 1965 he says the false Church groups this is from the resume of the ages the last chapter the false Church groups will come together in a world Council churches This World Council the churches is the image Ed to the Beast and we read Revelations 131 to18 now remember it was Imperial Pagan Rome that fell by the sword but she was healed of a death stroke when she joined to the nominal Christian Church of Rome and Incorporated paganism and Christianity and thereby became the Holy Roman Empire which was to endure until Jesus came and destroyed her but Rome is not going alone her daughters are right with her and she will make she will take over absolute Authority by the World Council of churches remember it said the image would cause all to worship the Beast yeah will cause so receive absolute Authority by the world counil churches this may seem farfetched to some but actually it's very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great is that control this ecumenical move will end up with Rome at the head even though the people did not Envision it that way have you ever seen footage of people meeting the pope doesn't matter what country he goes to or if people come to him they come to him he's the boss he's the boss when they roll out the red carpet it's not that he would come and meet them but that they would come and meet him right am hey he's the boss he will see he end up with Rome at the head this is so because in Revelations 13 17 3-6 it states that the whole mystery of Babylon is Seated on the Beast is controlling the last or fourth Empire this Roman Church is going is doing that with the World Church system under Rome will be controlling and this image church system will be obedient to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world thus all the people will have to belong to the church uh World Church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast and the Hand of or head this Mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the World Church system which is trinitarianism ETC and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the World Church this with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride this image will try and keep the bride from preaching and teaching Etc her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and Truth to people to the people who need it but before the Antichrist in person takes over this complete World System of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with be with the Lord God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the Lamb hallelujah thank Lord amen this is where we are amen we are here we're not looking for things to happen it's already happened you know we where we are in time is so late when many times we we you read the scripture think maybe when's this going to happen it's already happened it's already happening we're at the end time that's right amen hallelujah but God sent a message remember the tears would be bound for the burning first but then gather the wheat to the so as the tears are being bound God has sent a voice into this world am me to gather the wheat he say how do I that's why I say if there's something in you that's responded to this word if there's something it says yes this is me yes this is true even it had to tell your strips off your back when you first heard it and you had to virtually you know you had to give up everything you loved you had to give up something and you said yes this is me you're wheat amen amen if something in you says yes this is true this message is true and it's not just your lip service but your life gives testimony to it you're wheat and you've been gathered for the bar amen hallelujah amen how do I know I'm predestinated because something in me says I believe this word amen amen and that's all it doesn't matter how you feel good times bad times whatever times something in you says this is true and you couldn't forsake it even if you wanted to Hallelujah that means you're the elected ones that means you're the one that that he is looking for Hallelujah and I'll say this as well if the devil Whispers in your ear this is not really this is just a bunch of hooky Spooks or conspiracy and there's nothing to this he's a liar amen this these events is this lived out amen hallelujah amen maybe let's just leave it there shall we can we have some musicians to come we've heard a voice in this day I trust you've heard it don't let it become common to you amen we have a way of Escape out of this world and that's the Rapture of the church hallelujah hallelujah I was watching a I was watching a thing on Moses last night a a uh it was the Bible Min uh uh you know the Bible miniseries and here's the people you know I was thinking why can't they just quote the scripture and stay with it but hey it's all right and then so the Israel is fleeing through the Red Sea it's been parted and and so they dramatized it that the Egyptians are literally right on their heels yeah now we're living in a time I'll probably say this we're living in a time where we have been literally our backs are against the wall like they were against the Red Sea and we forget sometimes that God told Moses you know I don't know why they dramatize these things and then you know the people God told Moses take the people here down to here and you come to the Red Sea here he tells them to do it and this is all arranged because God is saying to Pharaoh bring all your power am bring all your power see what you can do and then when it looks like the whole thing is hopeless God opens the sea and there's and and they're going through the sea into a new land they've never been before amen and when the enemy tries to come through that same way he gets destroyed it's the same thing with you and I we're standing we're standing Time and Eternity is blending and our way through that red sea is the rapture amen and the devil God has allow the devil to bring all his forces to trap him upon this Earth amen that's why the devil's raging because the God is allow he says come come Pharaoh bring your chariots bring your weapons bring bring all your demon powers amen because he's actually giving the devil a challenge yeah come come try what you can do show your Mighty power and there's an elected lady that's about to step from time into eternity G am
