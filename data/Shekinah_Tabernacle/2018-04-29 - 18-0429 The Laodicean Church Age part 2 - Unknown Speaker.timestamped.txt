[9:16] we really get into service we've got a
[9:17] couple of I got a testimony and two
[9:20] specials today so you all just can take
[9:23] your seats I think we'll start off with
[9:29] a taste of money so we can just get
[9:30] ready for the special brother George
[9:32] felt they to just share a taste of money
[9:34] with us things it's more of a sharing
[9:48] testimony I mean he's a bit of a
[9:49] testimony as well but I just came back
[9:54] from Greece I was there for a month a
[9:56] week and for us Christians a trip the
[10:04] journey is a spiritual one more than a
[10:05] physical one and there was a lot of
[10:08] things I saw there and there was some
[10:14] nice things and bad things some
[10:16] successes and failures I just want to
[10:20] share though a few a couple of things my
[10:31] aunt is quite sick she's been sick quite
[10:33] a few years and I had a nice time with
[10:38] her Mike took her out for a coffee right
[10:42] before I left it was a nice sunny day
[10:45] she's a believing woman coming out from
[10:49] an orthodox background Greek Orthodox
[10:50] backgrounds and we talked about the Lord
[10:55] and one thing I and I showed her you
[11:04] know we're talking about the Lord all
[11:05] day where was she was very she was very
[11:10] happy although she was very sick she was
[11:12] very happy
[11:15] to talk about these things
[11:17] and at the end of the day I showed her
[11:22] some videos of our church and some
[11:24] singing and translated to her and one
[11:30] thing that really but this is what I
[11:32] wanted to share with everybody is how we
[11:37] are the Bride of Christ and this is the
[11:40] highest relationship we can have with
[11:42] God and how this relationship is hidden
[11:46] to the world and to the denominations
[11:51] this relationship is very very special
[11:56] than in these last days like in
[11:58] Revelation it is it is their
[12:00] relationship that is most Jesus is
[12:04] portrayed as our husband and these last
[12:08] days
[12:09] it's especially it was always true but
[12:12] this in the last days is you know it's
[12:14] the time of the bride and that that
[12:19] relationship that that he records with
[12:22] my aunt and I think she you know there
[12:27] was attached there and it feels like the
[12:30] dawn breaking where you can't see the
[12:32] Sun you see the light but you can't see
[12:35] the Sun and you know there's failure
[12:38] there's a phase difference you know
[12:39] there's Donuts breaking at different
[12:41] times around the world you know and you
[12:46] know donees breaking at different parts
[12:49] of the world different times and
[12:51] although you can't see the Sun you see
[12:54] the lights and you know that it's coming
[12:56] and I just want to encourage everybody
[12:59] in that and and there's also another
[13:03] thought well maybe I just link it up to
[13:08] the if it's the thought of something
[13:12] else we see self justification you know
[13:15] a lot of people it's easy to get so self
[13:20] justified and it's only God who
[13:23] justifies
[13:24] it's easy to say you know I'm right I'm
[13:25] wrong or you know he's wrong all this
[13:27] but it's only God who justifies and it's
[13:31] only God who shows us who's right and
[13:33] who's wrong and I just wanna this is
[13:36] just a couple of things I wanted to
[13:38] share in my journey thank you
[13:46] Thank You Bret George

[39:18] have your seats this morning so I'd like
[39:21] to continue on what I was speaking on on
[39:24] Wednesday where I where we're going to
[39:27] go into not in just one service but I
[39:30] want to go into all the scripture that
[39:31] God has fulfilled in this endless day we
[39:37] can someone just turn the air con down a
[39:39] bit I know it's all but woman here I
[39:41] don't know don't want anyone to fall
[39:42] asleep on me maybe open the door thank
[39:45] you brother hey I'm so we read here in
[39:48] Hosea 6 where there was a prophecy that
[39:52] we're where goddess yo speaking and he's
[39:56] speaking of her people that he says come
[39:58] let us return unto the Lord and he 'the
[40:00] torn he will heal us he is smitten ax
[40:02] spinning and he will bind us up now
[40:04] after three days he will revive us in
[40:07] the third day he will raise us up and we
[40:09] shall live in his sight now from the
[40:11] from the scripture if you read in in the
[40:14] in Peters epistles Peter says that one
[40:18] day with God as as a thousand years upon
[40:21] the earth so when when this was written
[40:23] Hosea was writing this speaking about
[40:25] the Jews where where they they will be
[40:28] scattered bases and the third day they
[40:31] will return unto their inheritance
[40:32] they'll return to the promised land and
[40:34] they will live in God's sight now this
[40:36] was written in BC well according to my
[40:39] Bible chronological order your the times
[40:42] it says that this was written in BC 780
[40:46] so this was written in you say over
[40:49] 2,000 years ago this this prophecy was
[40:51] written and it says in the third day we
[40:53] shall return and live and live in God's
[40:55] sight so if we we can see that the
[40:58] scripture has been fulfilled as rules
[40:59] being called and in our nation seventy
[41:02] years
[41:02] upon the earth for the first time in
[41:05] over two-and-a-half thousand years there
[41:06] are a nation once again and so so now
[41:09] Israel's been gathered and the reason
[41:11] Israel's been gathering is because in
[41:13] this end time people have been gathered
[41:15] we all been gathered to a place you know
[41:18] as as Jesus said now the harvest has
[41:20] come in this season where where the
[41:22] tares are bound for the burning but the
[41:24] wheat is gathered into the garner you
[41:26] know so we'll began that all of us will
[41:28] be gathered to a place right will be
[41:30] either gathered into Christ or be
[41:32] gathered you know with the world systems
[41:34] that will be burnt in the tribulation
[41:36] this is this is a harvest going on and
[41:38] so there's a gathering in this end time
[41:40] and so I just want to go into these
[41:43] things because we live in the most
[41:45] wonderful time to be alive you know we
[41:47] don't need to be afraid of nuclear war
[41:49] or whatever may be coming upon the earth
[41:51] all those things may happen but we have
[41:54] a promise in the scripture that before
[41:56] the first nuclear bomb drops I mean the
[41:58] bride will be raptured into glory
[41:59] hallelujah so we're so glad we have that
[42:02] opportunity to become one with him that
[42:05] he will take us off the earth now if we
[42:09] go to I just want to go to revelations
[42:11] if you want to read with me in
[42:12] revelations chapter one I'm just kind of
[42:18] continuing on trying to lay a foundation
[42:23] and I wanted to try and take thoughts
[42:25] because there's lots of things happen in
[42:27] the sages lots of Scripture being
[42:29] fulfilled
[42:29] so Jesus last few moments if you look at
[42:32] all the prophecies Jesus from from being
[42:35] betrayed in the garden or even at the
[42:36] last last supper to when he was
[42:39] crucified and he rose again he he
[42:41] fulfilled many many prophecies just in
[42:44] those last few hours of his life was
[42:46] very rapid scripture being fulfilled and
[42:48] so because many times people say well
[42:52] these things are afar off you know maybe
[42:54] you know it'll be maybe in the next
[42:56] generation that you know the rapture
[42:57] will happen and enough that the
[42:58] tribulation but the scripture can be
[43:00] fulfilled very quickly very rapidly and
[43:03] I just want to bring to light as we go
[43:07] through this series that all the
[43:09] scripture that God is fulfilling in our
[43:10] day you know we are living in Bible days
[43:12] this is not a just a book of history and
[43:15] the
[43:16] a book of the future but God is
[43:18] fulfilling his word today and your
[43:20] generation scripture is being fulfilled
[43:22] a means I want to go through these
[43:24] things that we would see the day an hour
[43:26] in which we live because we understand
[43:28] this is a road map this is a map from
[43:30] from earth to glory right but the thing
[43:33] is with a map if you don't know where
[43:35] you are in the map how do you know how
[43:37] to get to your destination like if I
[43:39] wanted to drive to say I've no Drive to
[43:42] Auckland and I've never driven there
[43:45] before and I have a map in front of me I
[43:47] can see Auckland on the map but I don't
[43:49] know where I am how do I know where to
[43:50] begin my journey because I can guess
[43:53] maybe I'm well maybe I'm in Wellington
[43:54] maybe I'm in New Plymouth maybe I'm an
[43:56] Guzman I don't know and then now I've
[43:58] got to turn left and turn right but I'll
[44:00] end up lost because I don't know where I
[44:02] am but if you as soon as you know where
[44:04] you are then you know how far you have
[44:05] to journey that's the same thing in the
[44:07] Bible we're going to find out where we
[44:09] are and when we find out where we are
[44:11] then we can know where we're going to
[44:12] journey to amen so we've got a so that's
[44:16] why it's so wonderful in the state we're
[44:18] not wandering in darkness God has
[44:20] revealed his word to us that we know
[44:22] where we are
[44:23] hallelujah our revelations 1 and and 3
[44:26] so it says so I just want to take a few
[44:30] thoughts out of out of this first
[44:31] chapter just as we go through so the
[44:33] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[44:35] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[44:39] the things which must shortly come to
[44:41] pass and he sent it and signified it by
[44:44] his angel unto his servant John who bare
[44:47] record of the word of God and of the
[44:49] testimony of Jesus Christ and of the
[44:51] things that he saw blessed is he that
[44:53] readeth and they that hear the words of
[44:56] this prophecy and keep those things that
[44:58] are written thereon for the time is at
[45:01] hand now the first thing I want to just
[45:04] take out this is this is a book of the
[45:06] book of Revelation in the book of
[45:07] prophecy and it's also a book of symbols
[45:11] so and we'll read it later but because
[45:13] Jesus instructs John what you see right
[45:16] in a book and seen to the seven churches
[45:17] and so it's a book of prophecy you read
[45:20] it in the last chapter of Revelations
[45:22] God says if you add or take away from
[45:24] this prophecy your name will be taken
[45:25] out of the book of life so it's a book
[45:26] of prophecy it's prophesying the future
[45:28] events
[45:29] and John he what he saw he wrote down so
[45:32] when he saw a white horse rider write
[45:33] forth with a you know with the bow no
[45:35] arrows and was given a crown that's what
[45:37] he saw and he wrote it down but it's all
[45:39] symbolic and it the the symbols have a
[45:42] meaning just like the Book of Daniel
[45:43] meaning of Daniels you know dreams and
[45:46] visions that he had was symbolic like
[45:48] Nebuchadnezzar's Imogen and and the four
[45:51] beasts and different things he saw that
[45:52] was symbolic but they are interpreted
[45:55] okay so it's the same thing with the
[45:57] book of Revelation so what so he's
[46:00] commanded now this is a book of prophecy
[46:02] and then and then I just want to drop
[46:08] down because I'm not going to read the
[46:08] whole chapter he is I John am also also
[46:12] am your brother and companion in the
[46:13] tribulation and the kingdom and patience
[46:15] of Jesus Christ who was on the Isle
[46:17] called Patmos for the word of God and
[46:19] for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was
[46:22] in the spirit on the Lord's Day and
[46:23] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[46:26] trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[46:28] first and the last what they'll see us
[46:30] see what you see write down what you see
[46:32] us write in the book and send it unto
[46:34] the seven churches which are in Asia and
[46:36] to Ephesus under Smyrna unto Pergamos
[46:38] unto Thyatira and decide us unto
[46:41] Philadelphia and unto Lady hacia and I
[46:46] turned to see the voice that spake with
[46:48] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[46:50] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[46:52] seven candlesticks one like unto the Son
[46:55] of Man clothed with a garment down to
[46:57] the foot and good about the paps with a
[46:59] golden girdle and his head and his hairs
[47:01] were white like wool as white as snow
[47:04] and his eyes were as a flame of fire now
[47:07] we're going to see what this means
[47:08] because it's interpreted he says and his
[47:10] feet were like fine brass as if they
[47:13] burned in a furnace his voice of the
[47:15] sound of many waters and he had in his
[47:17] right hand seven stars out of his mouth
[47:19] went a sharp two-edged sword as
[47:21] countenance was as the Sun shines and
[47:23] his strength and when I saw him I fell
[47:25] at his feet as dead and he laid his
[47:27] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[47:30] not I am the first and the last I am he
[47:34] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[47:36] Alive for evermore amen and have the
[47:38] keys of hell and of death write the
[47:40] things which thou have seen anything
[47:42] which are and the things which shall be
[47:45] Hereafter
[47:46] the mystery of the Seven Stars which
[47:48] thou source in my right hand and the
[47:51] Seven golden candlesticks the seven
[47:53] stars are the angels of the seven
[47:55] churches and the seven candlesticks
[47:57] which thou sawest are the seven churches
[48:01] now I just want to I just want to break
[48:03] down a part of the sky I want to show
[48:04] that God has been working from you know
[48:06] because we read the Bible and we read
[48:08] you know the Gospels Jesus ministered in
[48:11] the book of Acts the same Jesus down now
[48:13] on his now in his church working and
[48:16] then we read the epistles and then we
[48:18] read maybe the book of Revelation and we
[48:19] wonder what's been going on from because
[48:22] we're in 2018 it's been 2,000 years from
[48:24] when when the Bible was you could say
[48:26] written and now we're 2,000 years down
[48:28] the road so what's been going on you
[48:30] know because many people God just you
[48:32] know many people think well after after
[48:34] the book of Acts or after Paul's
[48:36] ministry God kind of just crossed his
[48:38] arms and just sat back and watch the
[48:39] world go by as as the church was trying
[48:42] to you know spread the gospel and things
[48:44] but God has been fulfilling his word all
[48:46] the way down through two thousand years
[48:47] it's been prophecy that's been fulfilled
[48:50] God God has been working in the lives of
[48:53] people from from the book of Acts down
[48:55] to today God is not an impersonal God
[48:58] God has been interested in the in the
[49:00] affairs and lives of men and women he's
[49:02] interested in you today he's not some
[49:05] distant god that says well maybe they'll
[49:07] make it maybe they won't let's find out
[49:09] he knows the end from the beginning he's
[49:11] interested in your life he's in the
[49:13] details of your life he cares about you
[49:15] he's interested in you right and so now
[49:18] we read here that that it's already been
[49:22] interpreted so the seven stars are in
[49:24] his hand now all this is symbolic but
[49:26] the seven stars in his hand are the
[49:28] seven angels to the seven churches and
[49:30] the seven golden candlesticks which I
[49:32] saw are the seven churches now there's
[49:36] been seven so so the seven stars are the
[49:38] angels to the seven churches now if you
[49:40] go look at the definition of the word
[49:42] angel so when we read it in English we
[49:45] think of a heavenly being with wings
[49:46] when we normally think of an angel
[49:49] you think of a heavenly being with wings
[49:50] but that's not always the case in a
[49:52] Bible because in the Bible the word
[49:54] angel means a messenger
[49:56] the angel means you know the word angel
[49:58] means a messenger and if you go look at
[50:01] the scriptures the Angels never preach
[50:03] the gospel to the people so if God sends
[50:06] an angel to a church he's not going to
[50:08] send a heavenly angel to preach the
[50:10] gospel because that's not God's program
[50:12] God uses man to preachers gospel he
[50:15] could have had the wind preach the
[50:17] gospel or the trees or or or heavenly
[50:19] beings but he chose man to work through
[50:22] for his plan of redemption and so you
[50:25] can see this annex and in Acts chapter
[50:27] 10 I don't have it on the PowerPoint you
[50:29] go read Acts chapter 10 there's
[50:31] Cornelius at Gentile and he's praying
[50:33] and he knows only the god of the Old
[50:36] Testament and an angel appears before
[50:38] him and says that your arms and your
[50:40] prayers have come up before God and he
[50:42] instruct he doesn't preach for this is
[50:44] after the cross this is after the day of
[50:46] Pentecost the Holy Ghost has been given
[50:48] but this angel tells him go find Peter
[50:52] and he will tell you the words of
[50:53] eternal life the angel could have told
[50:56] them but it wasn't the angels job God
[50:58] works through his body right so so so
[51:01] Cornelius said for to sent two men to go
[51:04] get Peter and Joppa wherever it was he
[51:06] came back to Cornelius house and they
[51:09] had a meeting and it says well yet Peter
[51:11] spake these words of what God was doing
[51:13] in there down our the Holy Ghost fell
[51:15] upon them and they were filled with the
[51:17] Holy Ghost the same as they were on the
[51:19] day of Pentecost
[51:20] so God works through men right so these
[51:23] seven stars are seven ministry seven
[51:27] messengers to the seven churches okay
[51:30] and even Paul says in Galatians 4 and 13
[51:32] and 14 he says you know that through the
[51:35] infirmity of the flesh I preached the
[51:36] gospel unto you at the first and my
[51:39] temptation which was in my flesh you
[51:41] despised not neither rejected but
[51:43] received me as an angel of God even as
[51:46] Christ Jesus so they received Paul as a
[51:48] angel of messenger right so there's been
[51:52] seven messengers down through the church
[51:54] ages now I have to background all this
[51:56] because not only is God been working
[51:58] Satan has been working when the Holy
[52:01] Ghost felled the Antichrist spirit fell
[52:03] John says that the Antichrist spirits
[52:06] come already into the world right so
[52:09] the over darkness all everything the
[52:12] enemy's been doing down through two
[52:13] thousand years and all that God has been
[52:15] doing has now built up into this last H
[52:18] Alou you I'm glad that we're not just
[52:20] fighting this battle alone it's more for
[52:23] stand against us I mean all of heaven is
[52:26] behind us believers hallelujah now this
[52:29] is a diagram and this is from the seven
[52:32] churches book where I don't know if you
[52:34] can quite so it's a bit small but now
[52:36] these seven churches that we read about
[52:37] they were prophetic the condition in
[52:39] those churches was prophetic speaking of
[52:42] future ages right because many people
[52:45] say well it was just for those churches
[52:46] in Asia
[52:47] therefore this doesn't apply to us but
[52:50] it applies to us it's a prophecy okay
[52:52] and you can go through history and we're
[52:54] not going to do it today but you can go
[52:56] through history and you can see when you
[52:58] read revelations two and three what God
[53:01] is describing in each church you can see
[53:03] it repeated in history right and so now
[53:06] there was a star there was a messenger
[53:08] to each period of time from Calvary to
[53:11] doubt now Paul was the messenger to the
[53:14] first stage well he wrote most of the
[53:16] New Testament he he placed Lauren Grace
[53:18] correctly so he was the ministry that
[53:22] that was the light to the to the first
[53:25] church okay and then on down through
[53:28] some of these people maybe you're not
[53:29] very familiar with Iranians of Martin
[53:31] and Columba then we have so now this is
[53:34] the this period as the iron age or the
[53:37] Dark Ages and that's what it's called in
[53:40] history it's the Dark Ages the Catholic
[53:42] Church basically ruled the world
[53:43] they they had all the gospel you know
[53:45] the Bible's away people weren't even
[53:47] allowed to look at him you know even
[53:49] open the page of the Bible and read it
[53:50] because and they had absolute control
[53:52] but God had not finished because God God
[53:57] knew this would happen he knew that the
[53:59] church would would would buy it by an
[54:02] antichrist burnovich they'd go down and
[54:04] persecution go down in the ground of the
[54:06] Dark Ages he says I shall restore saith
[54:09] the Lord
[54:10] and so now Martin Luther even before him
[54:14] hundred years before him a man was he
[54:16] was a man called John HUS or maybe I
[54:18] should go back Columbo here was the
[54:22] messenger to the
[54:23] cages now history tells us and but
[54:28] there's a rule of thumb which I should
[54:29] actually say here now this is how the
[54:32] messengers were chosen he sees it so at
[54:35] the time of the giving of Revelation ad
[54:37] 94 Paul had already died but according
[54:44] to tradition Paul literally died a minor
[54:45] but John was carrying on and see it
[54:47] exactly as Paul had done in the days of
[54:49] his ministry the death of Paul before
[54:51] the revelation was given does not at all
[54:53] annul the fact that he was the messenger
[54:55] to the ephesian church age for the
[54:57] messenger to every age regardless of
[54:59] when he appears or ghost as the one who
[55:02] influences that age for God by means of
[55:05] a word manifested ministry Paul was that
[55:07] man so Paul had signs and wonders Paul
[55:10] pointed people that Jesus Christ not to
[55:13] an organization Paul's burden was that
[55:16] man would not have a relationship with
[55:17] the church a system he that was this
[55:21] burden he didn't want people to have a
[55:23] relationship with a system that's what
[55:24] people that's what people think in these
[55:26] days they think if you have if you're
[55:28] part of a church system therefore you go
[55:31] to heaven and go overlook anything
[55:33] that's wrong that's not what God wants
[55:34] God wants you to have relationship with
[55:36] him he wants
[55:38] you never relationship with Jesus Christ
[55:39] in his word not just being part of a
[55:42] you're a church system right so so he he
[55:47] had signs and wonders see so God men
[55:50] have backed up what Paul said and he was
[55:53] preaching according to the seasons he
[55:54] rose in and he and he joined the people
[55:56] to Jesus Christ and if you take that you
[55:59] take that pattern and you take it
[56:01] through history the one closest to that
[56:03] pattern is the messenger right so Paul
[56:05] had already died before the Ephesian Age
[56:07] started and Columba had already died
[56:11] before the thought Iron Age started but
[56:14] the reason I was saying that as church
[56:17] history says that Columba founded a
[56:19] Bible School up and up in Scotland and
[56:22] it says that for the next nine hundred
[56:24] years after that Bible School was
[56:26] founded by Columba the vast majority the
[56:28] evangelical Christian work came out of
[56:31] that Bible school so he affected the
[56:33] dark ages amen for the Lord okay
[56:36] and
[56:37] and in that ministry then they'd
[56:40] influence a man called called called
[56:42] white cliff who knows their Bible
[56:45] history and so he had a burden he just
[56:48] wanted the people to have the word in
[56:50] their language so was in Latin but he
[56:52] wanted it in English and so so he had
[56:55] that burden and then his and then what
[56:58] happened is now but his influence then
[57:01] was taken to a place called Bohemia
[57:03] where it influenced a years later a man
[57:06] called John HUS and John HUS wanted the
[57:09] same thing he had a burn he wanted thee
[57:11] he wanted the Bible instead of being
[57:13] sealed away in Latin he wanted in the
[57:15] common people's language and but he was
[57:17] burned at the stake by the Catholic
[57:19] Church but he said in a hundred years
[57:21] a man will stand up with the same belief
[57:24] and you will not destroy him and a
[57:26] hundred years later Martin Luther came
[57:28] on the scene and the Reformation was on
[57:31] hallelujah so and so Lucy even though
[57:34] Luther was the one who influenced that
[57:36] age the most and in John Wesley after
[57:39] that he heard a commentary that Luther
[57:43] wrote on the book of Romans and his
[57:45] heart was warmed something happened to
[57:47] him and he had a real salvation
[57:50] experience he came out of the Anglican
[57:51] Church he didn't want to start a new
[57:52] church but they kicked them out and he
[57:54] preached an open field with with George
[57:56] Whitfield and different ones and the
[57:58] people came out of darkness and they
[58:00] received a light for their day so he
[58:03] influenced that age the most Alleluia is
[58:06] the starts of the age amen and then said
[58:09] now but now we live in this lady or C&H
[58:12] we live in the last church age and this
[58:15] started this age came in with a with a
[58:19] desire of the people that the gifts of
[58:21] the Spirit would be restored who's read
[58:23] about the Azusa Street revival the
[58:26] Pentecostal movement was birthed you
[58:28] know there and there were small
[58:30] outpourings before that but this was the
[58:32] major one and people went out from there
[58:33] and the world has been changed since
[58:35] then Amen but that's not the full part
[58:38] of the restoration because if we read
[58:40] our let's go to now is that clear for
[58:46] everyone class are you're following me
[58:48] we're having a bit of a
[58:50] teaching today if that's all right but
[58:52] there's a there's a start to an age and
[58:55] he brings the light to the age right
[58:57] just like you know and so but that's why
[59:00] these people they fought an antichrist
[59:04] spirit and that Antichrist spirit is
[59:07] still moving in this in this end time
[59:09] right so just as God member there's more
[59:12] for us than against us that's why we
[59:14] should always rejoice when the Bible
[59:16] says greater is He that is in you than
[59:19] he that is in the world so it doesn't
[59:21] matter how dark the world looks like
[59:23] it's getting and how bad things may be
[59:24] greater is He that is in me then it is
[59:28] in the world hallelujah now let's just
[59:34] go
[59:35] so not only now not only has God because
[59:38] so not only has God been reflecting
[59:40] himself through ministries to the earth
[59:44] Satan has been doing the same thing now
[59:48] let's go to revelations 6 and 1 we're
[59:54] just going to go through I just want to
[59:55] lay a background because all darkness is
[59:57] here all light is here hallelujah all
[1:00:00] that heaviness is upon the earth amen
[1:00:03] I'm so glad we're not alone in this I
[1:00:06] just want to just be happy for a little
[1:00:08] bit you know if God is for us who can be
[1:00:12] against us hallelujah so we don't need
[1:00:15] to be worried now now as we were in
[1:00:17] Revelation chapter one it was a prophecy
[1:00:20] and it was symbols what you see right in
[1:00:23] a book and there's a book of prophecy
[1:00:26] right so now we're just changing the
[1:00:29] scene a bit and now so what we're going
[1:00:32] to read here it's all symbolic and so it
[1:00:37] says now and when I saw the lamb opened
[1:00:39] one of the seals I heard as it were the
[1:00:42] noise of thunder one of the four beasts
[1:00:44] saying come and see and I saw and behold
[1:00:47] a white horse and he that sat on him had
[1:00:50] a bow and a crown was given unto him and
[1:00:53] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[1:00:56] now this so this first so horse a beast
[1:01:02] and the Bible like this represents a
[1:01:03] power riding
[1:01:04] yeah power moving forth and so now this
[1:01:08] horse doubt let's just this is breakdown
[1:01:09] because many people in the church world
[1:01:11] think that this is the Holy Ghost riding
[1:01:13] forth in the first age to go to conquer
[1:01:17] and you know these things but we'll find
[1:01:19] out that this is not the this is not the
[1:01:22] Spirit of God riding forth but this is
[1:01:25] deception this is an antichrist spirit
[1:01:27] moving forth and and I'll show this to
[1:01:30] you so let's just look at these symbols
[1:01:31] so he had a white horse right which
[1:01:35] appears in the Bible normally that means
[1:01:36] a purity but we'll see that it's
[1:01:40] actually a deception and he and him that
[1:01:42] said on him had a bow doesn't say
[1:01:45] anything about arrows but just a bow and
[1:01:47] a crown was given unto him and he went
[1:01:49] forth conquering and to conquer now if
[1:01:52] you go read revelations chapter 19 let's
[1:01:55] just go read there quickly because I
[1:01:56] want to show you that is - there's two
[1:01:59] riders on white horses but they're very
[1:02:02] different they're not the same one says
[1:02:07] go to revelations 19 and 11 now just
[1:02:10] I'll just leave this up so you had to
[1:02:12] keep it in mind a bow no arrows he said
[1:02:15] on a white horse and a crown was given
[1:02:16] unto him and he went forth conquering if
[1:02:19] we read in Revelation 19:11 it says here
[1:02:23] and I saw heaven opened and behold a
[1:02:26] white horse all maybe this is the same
[1:02:28] one let's find out and he that sat on
[1:02:30] him was called faithful and true this
[1:02:32] one we read about wasn't given a name
[1:02:34] yet okay this one's called faithful and
[1:02:37] true and in righteousness he doth judge
[1:02:38] and make war and his eyes were as a
[1:02:40] flame of fire
[1:02:41] we read about that in revelations
[1:02:43] chapter 1 and I was hid were many crowns
[1:02:45] not just a crown many crowns and he had
[1:02:48] a name written that no man knew but he
[1:02:50] himself and he was clothed with a
[1:02:51] vesture dipped in blood and his name is
[1:02:54] called the Word of God and armies which
[1:02:57] were in heaven followed him upon white
[1:02:59] horses clothed in fine linen white and
[1:03:01] clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp
[1:03:03] sword that with it he should smite the
[1:03:06] nation's and he should rule them with a
[1:03:07] rod of iron and he treadeth the
[1:03:09] winepress of the fierceness of the wrath
[1:03:11] of Almighty God and he hath on his
[1:03:13] vesture on a thigh a name written king
[1:03:16] of kings
[1:03:17] and Lord of lords now this one has many
[1:03:20] crowns
[1:03:21] he's called faithful and true amen he's
[1:03:24] called the Word of God he is a sharp
[1:03:27] two-edged sword that comes out of his
[1:03:28] mouth he doesn't have a bow this is two
[1:03:31] different riders amen
[1:03:34] 1 1 1 is deception riding forth with a
[1:03:36] bow and then he was crowned and then the
[1:03:39] other one had a sharp two-edged it's all
[1:03:41] coming out of his mouth he's called the
[1:03:42] Word of God he's faithful and true and
[1:03:44] as vicious dipped in blood so the second
[1:03:47] one we read about this is Jesus Christ
[1:03:48] writing for write the first one is the
[1:03:50] Antichrist spirit trying to appear like
[1:03:53] the Holy Ghost riding forth as a
[1:03:55] deception ok
[1:03:57] and also I want to but I want to show
[1:03:59] you just quickly as well that what we
[1:04:02] read here these two verses they cover a
[1:04:04] space of time because if you look at
[1:04:07] church history now it sees a crown was
[1:04:10] given unto him so he went forth he went
[1:04:13] forth with a with a bow he had a bow so
[1:04:15] he comes a deception but then finally
[1:04:17] that deception was crowned and if you go
[1:04:20] look at church history when the Pope was
[1:04:22] crowned a crown was given to the first
[1:04:24] boat that's when this spirit was crowned
[1:04:26] because you can't crown a spirit you got
[1:04:28] a crown a person ok and so now there's a
[1:04:32] space of time where where the Holy Ghost
[1:04:34] comes in the book of Acts the same time
[1:04:36] the Antichrist spirit comes and these
[1:04:38] two now are in the fighting within the
[1:04:40] church trying to get preeminence it's
[1:04:42] the same thing today friends Alleluia
[1:04:45] that's why we've got to withstand the
[1:04:47] Antichrist spirit we're to stand upon
[1:04:48] the Word of God amen and then finally
[1:04:51] this Antichrist was crown when the when
[1:04:53] the when the first Pope was crowned so
[1:04:57] he went forth to conquer it so this is
[1:04:58] the Antichrist riding forth okay and you
[1:05:02] see that in church history and then
[1:05:04] after that we go to the next one and
[1:05:07] when he had opened the second seal I
[1:05:10] heard the second beast say come and see
[1:05:12] and there went out another horse that
[1:05:15] was red and power was given to him that
[1:05:18] he set thereon to take peace from the
[1:05:19] earth that they should kill one another
[1:05:21] and there was given unto him a great
[1:05:24] sword this is the same rider this is the
[1:05:28] same Antichrist prayer but changing his
[1:05:29] minister
[1:05:30] but there's still a deception following
[1:05:33] with it as well and you go and and you
[1:05:35] can see it in church history that
[1:05:37] finally after this antichrist spirit was
[1:05:39] crowned in in the state was now behind
[1:05:41] the church now they had a now they had
[1:05:44] an army now they could enforce upon the
[1:05:46] people you know recant or die recant or
[1:05:50] burn so he had a sword they used it
[1:05:52] he killed millions with that sword amen
[1:05:56] he killed millions with that sword and
[1:05:58] you can even see well you know and we
[1:06:02] all know that about you and church
[1:06:03] history so these things have already
[1:06:05] happened amen
[1:06:08] so now and so this was the Dark Ages oh
[1:06:13] it will follow in class okay just you
[1:06:17] know fall asleep or do something if you
[1:06:20] say I don't know okay and then an inn so
[1:06:24] the next power that rides forth and this
[1:06:26] is I'm just touching all the highlights
[1:06:27] today of these two things because I want
[1:06:30] to lay background for maybe so for next
[1:06:32] Sunday and so and when he had opened the
[1:06:34] third seal so the lamb opens the seals I
[1:06:36] heard the third beast say come and see
[1:06:38] and I beheld lo a black horse and he
[1:06:41] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[1:06:43] in his hand and I heard a voice in the
[1:06:46] midst of the four beasts say a measure
[1:06:47] of wheat for a penny and three measures
[1:06:50] of barley for a penny and see thou hurt
[1:06:52] not the oil and the wine so there comes
[1:06:55] a time now with thee where the Catholic
[1:06:56] Church is now you have to pay in order
[1:06:59] to get out of purgatory or get out of
[1:07:01] you know you know in order to get to
[1:07:02] heaven fast and so they start charging
[1:07:04] they start charging for salvation and
[1:07:07] this was the age where Martin Luther
[1:07:09] stood up and said this is wrong why
[1:07:11] should people pay for sins they're about
[1:07:13] to do you want no vania so no this is
[1:07:17] this was state-sponsored because they
[1:07:19] want to build a bigger yo Cathedral
[1:07:21] Basilica and you're on Rome this is why
[1:07:24] they had these schemes and so so the
[1:07:27] Antichrist power is riding forth and the
[1:07:29] biggest to try and charge for salvation
[1:07:33] but then there so this is now this is
[1:07:37] now in the time of the Reformation and
[1:07:39] I've got a diagram to show all this but
[1:07:40] I just want to go through these
[1:07:41] scriptures but then finally
[1:07:44] it comes now the last move of the
[1:07:47] Antichrist and when he had opened the
[1:07:50] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[1:07:53] fourth beast say come and see
[1:07:54] and I looked and behold a pale horse and
[1:07:58] his name that sat thereon was death so
[1:08:01] now finally this riders called he's
[1:08:03] called death this is this Antichrist
[1:08:05] spirit this religious spirit riding
[1:08:06] forth now he's called death he's been
[1:08:08] called a name and hell followed with him
[1:08:10] and the power was given given unto him
[1:08:13] over the fourth part of the earth to
[1:08:16] kill with the sword just like that red
[1:08:18] horse rider had a sword to kill and with
[1:08:20] hunger and with death and with the
[1:08:22] beasts of the earth now this one said on
[1:08:25] a pale horse and it's a mixture of the
[1:08:27] of the white red and the black you mix
[1:08:31] together you get a you're a funny kind
[1:08:32] of pale mixed color so all the powers
[1:08:35] that were riding before that now have
[1:08:37] come together and this is the devil
[1:08:39] riding forth because his name is called
[1:08:40] death now but I want to point out
[1:08:44] something as I said about the first seal
[1:08:46] it covers a space of time the Antichrist
[1:08:49] Burt wasn't crowned as soon as it turned
[1:08:51] up there's a few hundred years later
[1:08:53] then it was crowned so now this powers
[1:08:55] riding forth but then when the rider
[1:08:58] actually sits upon this eponymous power
[1:09:00] this is when the bride goes up okay but
[1:09:04] it's all the mixture of all the evil of
[1:09:05] the of the first three ages has come
[1:09:07] together in the fourth and this is this
[1:09:10] is what we're up against in this age the
[1:09:13] fear not little flock at your father's
[1:09:15] good pleasure to give you the kingdom
[1:09:17] Alleluia
[1:09:19] now I just want you to notice here every
[1:09:23] time that a seal is open there's a boy
[1:09:25] these are beasts
[1:09:26] it's got the first one and when I saw
[1:09:29] the lamb opened one of the seals I heard
[1:09:31] as it were the noise of thunder one of
[1:09:33] the four beasts saying come and see
[1:09:35] okay and then we go to verse three and
[1:09:38] we end it open the second seal I heard
[1:09:40] the second beast say come and see and in
[1:09:43] the and in the third one when I and we
[1:09:45] need open the third seal I heard the
[1:09:46] third beast say come and see and then
[1:09:49] now in the in the fourth seal when I
[1:09:52] heard the and when he had opened the
[1:09:53] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[1:09:55] fourth beast say come and see
[1:09:57] so the
[1:09:58] so there's another beasts saying come
[1:09:59] and see come and see come and see this
[1:10:02] come and see this so now well who is
[1:10:05] that now this is what we're gonna go to
[1:10:06] go on to now so if we go back in
[1:10:10] revelations chapter 4 we're gonna find
[1:10:13] out what these beasts are now these
[1:10:15] fourth now these four beasts you read
[1:10:17] about they're anointings that God seems
[1:10:18] upon the earth to combat what the enemy
[1:10:20] is doing that's why when the enemy comes
[1:10:23] in like a flood that said the Lord will
[1:10:25] raise up a standard so we don't need to
[1:10:27] worry
[1:10:27] amen as I see it there's more forest and
[1:10:29] against us God spurred us always here to
[1:10:31] combat the move of the enemy hallelujah
[1:10:34] that he would show his greatness now
[1:10:36] revelations 4 he says and before the
[1:10:39] throne there was a sea of glass like
[1:10:41] unto crystal and in the midst of the
[1:10:44] throne and round about the throne were
[1:10:45] four beasts who were full of eyes before
[1:10:48] him behind and the first piece was like
[1:10:51] unto a lion the second beast was like
[1:10:53] unto a calf the third beast like a face
[1:10:56] as a man and the fourth beast was like a
[1:10:59] flying eagle now we read there the when
[1:11:02] the lamb opened the you know when the
[1:11:04] lamb opened the first seal there was a
[1:11:05] noise of thunder and I heard the first
[1:11:08] piece say come and see
[1:11:09] so this is now God spirit coming it's
[1:11:13] the Holy Ghost in a in a in a different
[1:11:16] manifestation or you could say a
[1:11:18] different way to combat what the enemy
[1:11:19] is doing so now so now when the
[1:11:21] Antichrist was riding forth in the first
[1:11:23] stage God said a line anointing upon the
[1:11:26] church to combat that deception now
[1:11:28] that's the word that's the anointing of
[1:11:30] the of the true word to combat what the
[1:11:32] enemy is doing that's why Paul could
[1:11:34] stand he says he says I fought the beast
[1:11:36] at Ephesus who's read the other
[1:11:38] scriptures I fought the beast at Ephesus
[1:11:39] and that wasn't him in an arena fighting
[1:11:42] Lions and Ephesus that was demon pals
[1:11:44] within the church that he fought and
[1:11:47] withstood and you can see it in in annex
[1:11:50] chapter 15 where where you go X chapter
[1:11:53] 2 the other day of Pentecost the people
[1:11:55] all fully birthed into the kingdom but
[1:11:58] then when you come into about X 15
[1:11:59] there's now people coming among the
[1:12:01] believers and they're trying to get the
[1:12:03] Gentiles to become Jews before they
[1:12:06] became become Christians so now people
[1:12:09] weren't fully converted but yet
[1:12:11] religious had come in among the people
[1:12:13] and we're trying to drag them back to
[1:12:14] something that God had done away with so
[1:12:17] that Antichrist Burt was already working
[1:12:19] among them and Paul even said after my
[1:12:22] departure grievious wolves from among
[1:12:25] yourselves will rise up and Rin the
[1:12:27] flock so that was already sitting there
[1:12:30] it was already sitting there and he said
[1:12:32] after my departure will raise up among
[1:12:34] you and he was talking to them and some
[1:12:37] of those were the ones who would rise up
[1:12:38] and rend the flock because it was a
[1:12:40] religious Antichrist spirit working
[1:12:42] among them Amen this is a battle phrase
[1:12:46] we don't fight against flesh and blood
[1:12:49] amen but you know we don't need to be
[1:12:52] worried about these things
[1:12:53] that's why you're gonna be fully born
[1:12:55] into the kingdom can't just become a
[1:12:57] religious person I mean because a
[1:13:00] religious person God's not interested in
[1:13:02] religion he wants a relationship he
[1:13:04] wants to be united with you that's what
[1:13:06] that's what he wants he doesn't want us
[1:13:07] to go through some form of a life you
[1:13:10] know just a religion he wants to become
[1:13:11] one with us that's why he died on
[1:13:14] Calvary when I could not go to where he
[1:13:17] was he came to me hallelujah and he did
[1:13:20] that on Calvary to shed his blood to
[1:13:22] wash away my sins change my nature that
[1:13:25] he could come aspera could come and
[1:13:27] dwell in me hallelujah that was the
[1:13:29] purpose of us of a sacrifice now so the
[1:13:33] first beast was a lion that was that
[1:13:36] anointing went forth but when the
[1:13:37] Antichrist changes moved that we went
[1:13:39] from a white horse a deception to now a
[1:13:42] red horse with a sword he could kill now
[1:13:45] the the Holy Ghost changed its anointing
[1:13:48] to be like a calf and that's a a calf as
[1:13:52] a animal of sacrifice your research
[1:13:54] history you see people they rejoiced
[1:13:57] when they were being tortured they
[1:13:59] rejoiced when they went to the stake
[1:14:01] they rejoiced when their heads are going
[1:14:03] to be cut off I mean and it wasn't
[1:14:06] that's not normal
[1:14:07] that's not normal so I'm going to die
[1:14:09] today hallelujah
[1:14:10] no it was an anointing upon the church
[1:14:13] that they could withstand and overcome
[1:14:15] in their age that even though they were
[1:14:18] burned and they were sawn asunder and
[1:14:20] ripped and killed and whatever will
[1:14:22] happen to them tortured they they were
[1:14:24] pointed and they're anointing cause them
[1:14:26] to overcome that they would not recant
[1:14:28] we cannot turn back we cannot give up
[1:14:31] our Lord Jesus you're gonna have to burn
[1:14:33] me whatever you need to do I can't say
[1:14:34] no I can't join your religion I've got
[1:14:37] to stay with the truth and they gladly
[1:14:39] gave their lives why because they are
[1:14:41] anointed with a calf anointing and ox
[1:14:44] anointing hallelujah and I love it
[1:14:47] because if you look at it I believe it
[1:14:48] can only live according to the anointing
[1:14:50] that's upon them I mean they can't do
[1:14:53] anything else so they they just gladly
[1:14:55] gave their lives and now the fort now
[1:14:59] the third beast had the face as a man
[1:15:01] now a man has intelligence and you go
[1:15:04] you're read there you take Wyclif he was
[1:15:09] in the universities John Huss was a very
[1:15:11] learned man William Tyndale who was the
[1:15:14] first one to really translate the Bible
[1:15:15] after Wycliffe you know into English
[1:15:18] very smart people you knew multiple
[1:15:21] languages you know and so God and Martin
[1:15:24] Luther all your all the Reformers down
[1:15:26] the same very intelligent because they
[1:15:27] had a man's intelligence God sent an
[1:15:30] intelligence upon the church that they
[1:15:32] could take the wood and translate it and
[1:15:33] release it to the people Alleluia
[1:15:36] it was combating what the enemy was
[1:15:38] doing Alleluia
[1:15:40] but now we see that at this fourth beast
[1:15:42] now I just want to go back now in all of
[1:15:48] them I want to point this out here so
[1:15:51] let's read the fourth one we'll go
[1:15:53] backwards so when he'd opened the third
[1:15:56] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[1:15:58] forced fourth beast say come and see
[1:16:00] the voice of the fourth beast say come
[1:16:03] and see
[1:16:04] but in the others I heard the I heard
[1:16:06] the third beast say there's no I heard
[1:16:08] the voice so these are codes is that
[1:16:12] there's a differentiation here I want
[1:16:13] you to notice this the third piece Seco
[1:16:15] say come and see the second beast say
[1:16:18] come and see the first beast say come
[1:16:22] and see
[1:16:22] but then in the fourth it says I heard
[1:16:24] the voice of the fourth beast say come
[1:16:26] and see
[1:16:27] so now there's a voice coming forth to
[1:16:29] tell you what these things are and it's
[1:16:30] only under this seal that the rider is
[1:16:33] named and the power coming with them as
[1:16:35] shown and
[1:16:36] fully exposed for what it is amen and
[1:16:39] that's why we're not probing that's why
[1:16:42] there's a prophetic ministry has come in
[1:16:43] this day that we're not probing is this
[1:16:45] God as a Satan or what is this but God
[1:16:48] has sent a voice in this day that we
[1:16:50] know exactly what the enemy is doing
[1:16:52] hallelujah and you take the fourth beast
[1:16:55] there was the flying eagle now
[1:16:59] all those other animals are earthbound a
[1:17:01] lion is earthbound a ox is earthbound a
[1:17:05] man is earthbound but an eagle is a
[1:17:07] flying eagle that can fly above now if
[1:17:10] you look at this you know it's like if
[1:17:11] we were anywhere if we can just fly a
[1:17:15] little bit higher if we get lift up then
[1:17:17] you can really see the terrain you and
[1:17:18] just say you're lost in the bush and you
[1:17:20] just see hills and mountains and trees
[1:17:22] you maybe get lost where am I but if you
[1:17:25] just get lifted up above the terrain
[1:17:28] then you can see where you need to go
[1:17:30] and how you need to get out but if your
[1:17:32] earthbound you can't see the same as
[1:17:34] something in the sky right it's like an
[1:17:36] eagle flies high up in the sky it can
[1:17:38] see far-off but a lion or a man or an ox
[1:17:41] they just see maybe this they can't see
[1:17:44] very far off so now the anointing that
[1:17:46] is upon the church in this day is an
[1:17:47] eagle anointing I mean that we can see
[1:17:50] from eternity to eternity amen we can
[1:17:53] see what the enemy is doing we can see
[1:17:56] what God is doing
[1:17:56] Alleluia and if you can see what your
[1:17:58] enemy is doing you can evade them
[1:18:01] hallelujah you can fly what you're if
[1:18:03] he's just working on the ground you can
[1:18:05] you can fly up hallelujah and this and
[1:18:08] there's some Eagles I've seen you have
[1:18:10] seen prick see some Eagles actually eat
[1:18:12] snakes
[1:18:13] it's the Serpent's on the ground but
[1:18:15] they don't come and fight these ship and
[1:18:16] on the ground they pick them up and they
[1:18:19] fly up into the sky because of the snake
[1:18:22] if it doesn't have anything to work with
[1:18:23] it can't move only yeah that's where you
[1:18:27] see like the Crocker a hundred different
[1:18:29] ones they pick up a snake by its tail
[1:18:31] and it just hangs there can't get them
[1:18:33] carrying it because it's got nothing to
[1:18:35] work against it's like Eagle they you
[1:18:37] know the others an eagle takes the who
[1:18:39] seen the photo who seen that amen sir
[1:18:42] you think it doesn't come down and fight
[1:18:44] the snake and his ground he takes him up
[1:18:45] into heavenly places
[1:18:46] hallelujah where the snake can't move
[1:18:49] he just kills them in there they will
[1:18:50] just eat this devil and okay amen
[1:18:54] so now we're anointed that's why we are
[1:18:56] not you know pulses we're not ignorant
[1:18:58] to the devil's devices amen
[1:19:01] we're not ignorant to what he's doing
[1:19:03] because his voices come hallelujah to
[1:19:06] say come and see and I'll show you this
[1:19:08] is the devil riding forth this is the
[1:19:10] powers of Hell coming with them early
[1:19:13] and we're anointed with a flying eagle
[1:19:15] anointing this is the Holy Ghost it's
[1:19:17] the Holy Ghost all the way through just
[1:19:19] anointing the people in a different way
[1:19:21] to combat what the enemy is doing amen
[1:19:26] so now this is the anointing that's upon
[1:19:28] us now let's just show you a picture and
[1:19:31] then um can we see it not too well sorry
[1:19:36] I couldn't make a bigger but I'll I'll
[1:19:38] make a better picture one I just grabbed
[1:19:40] this off the internet from how it ties
[1:19:42] in but now down here are the seven
[1:19:47] churches and then we've got the
[1:19:48] Tribulation Period and then the
[1:19:50] Millennium okay now this is the four
[1:19:56] first four seals we read about and this
[1:20:00] the first four seals are the working of
[1:20:02] the Antichrist spirit upon the earth
[1:20:04] okay and now the reason why there's
[1:20:07] Ephesus Smyrna you know the you know the
[1:20:09] church ages are lumped together like
[1:20:11] this it's because it's showing what the
[1:20:14] enemy is doing in each of those ages now
[1:20:17] we live in a lady of sea and age we live
[1:20:20] in the seventh church age now maybe
[1:20:21] let's just read that scripture no
[1:20:25] actually I'll explain this and I'll show
[1:20:26] you why I can say that okay so so this
[1:20:32] is the enemy so the first seals the
[1:20:34] Whitehorse the you know the deception
[1:20:36] then God sends a lion anointing of us
[1:20:39] Holy Ghost to combat it and then there's
[1:20:42] the Ox anointing to combat what the
[1:20:43] enemy is doing it in this third seal the
[1:20:45] other man anointing to combat the black
[1:20:47] horse rider but now on this and this
[1:20:49] lady I've seen aged now everything
[1:20:52] that's been in the first ages is now
[1:20:54] mixed in come together into this age but
[1:20:58] in this age there's many things that are
[1:21:00] going on it's not just
[1:21:02] so in this age as I said the very
[1:21:04] beginning Israel's comeback as a nation
[1:21:06] and you can read that in Matthew chapter
[1:21:08] 24 when the fig tree foots poor puts
[1:21:11] forth its buds you know summer is naive
[1:21:13] and at the door and a fig tree in the
[1:21:15] Bible that represents Israel it's when
[1:21:17] it comes to be a nation again you know
[1:21:19] that summer's night or the millennium is
[1:21:20] nigh and Jesus says this generation that
[1:21:23] sees this shall not pass away till all
[1:21:25] things be fulfilled and they've been a
[1:21:27] nation seventy years so the generation
[1:21:30] of people that see the fig tree become a
[1:21:31] nation you know you know the fig tree
[1:21:33] blossom forth again that generation
[1:21:35] won't pass - all these things are done
[1:21:36] and they've been a nation seventy years
[1:21:40] we're at the end
[1:21:42] Alleluia that's going home time that's
[1:21:46] why I find everyone you can say there's
[1:21:49] a better way of life you don't have to
[1:21:50] be a slave to the world or some religion
[1:21:52] you can become one with Jesus Christ
[1:21:53] have joyous people full of glory he'll
[1:21:56] be your comforter he'll be your guide
[1:21:58] he'll be your husband he'll take care of
[1:22:01] you he'll guide you he'll love you he'll
[1:22:04] reveal himself to you wholly he'll do
[1:22:06] all those things and more
[1:22:07] I mean that's why we should earnestly
[1:22:09] contend for the faith that was once
[1:22:11] delivered to the Saints that seasoned
[1:22:13] Jude for that faith that was given I
[1:22:15] mean in that faith was a union with
[1:22:17] Jesus Christ I mean they were not bad
[1:22:19] down under man's ideas and man's
[1:22:21] teachings and and and what we think if
[1:22:23] we can do you know our ability we're not
[1:22:26] worried about those things
[1:22:27] he did it all Alleluia amen and if he
[1:22:32] made it I'm going to make it if he ever
[1:22:34] come I'll overcome I mean if he's
[1:22:36] victorious I'm victorious because I'm
[1:22:38] under pending upon him hallelujah so now
[1:22:42] so now here we are in this last H and
[1:22:49] then after this we have the Tribulation
[1:22:52] Period in the Millennium now but we'll
[1:22:54] go on to the fifth sixth and seventh
[1:22:55] seal later but those some people when
[1:22:58] they read this they think this is all
[1:23:00] chronological because the first four are
[1:23:02] but the fifth sixth and seventh they
[1:23:04] overlap but there's no for today now
[1:23:08] let's read revelations three
[1:23:16] because I said each of these leaders to
[1:23:19] the seven churches are prophetic speak
[1:23:22] and the condition that is in those
[1:23:24] churches that that God's writing about
[1:23:26] they're speaking of future but have I
[1:23:29] said we're in the seventh the first six
[1:23:30] already done
[1:23:36] it's a revelations three 14 and 17 he
[1:23:44] says and unto the angel or the messenger
[1:23:47] of the church the lady o sins write
[1:23:50] these things saith the Amen the faithful
[1:23:52] and true witness the beginning of the
[1:23:54] creation of God I know thy works that
[1:23:56] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[1:23:59] that thou wert cold cold or hot so then
[1:24:04] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:24:06] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[1:24:07] mouth
[1:24:08] all these things they have meaning but
[1:24:11] we won't go into it just now because
[1:24:14] thou sayeth I am rich now this is the
[1:24:17] confession of the church today because
[1:24:19] they'll say as I'm rich and increased
[1:24:21] with Goods and have need of nothing and
[1:24:24] knowest not so what let's just stop
[1:24:26] there this is the confession of the
[1:24:28] church world I was in the first time I
[1:24:30] ever saw my appearance as many of you
[1:24:32] know they used to live in Papua New
[1:24:34] Guinea third world country the first
[1:24:36] time we ever went to a church over there
[1:24:37] they were reading this scripture and now
[1:24:40] saying look we are rich and increased
[1:24:41] with Goods and from a Western eyes you
[1:24:46] would look at them with you know yo some
[1:24:49] villagers don't have power they don't
[1:24:51] have running water you know they live in
[1:24:53] what we would call shacks they have
[1:24:55] virtually nothing in our eyes but in
[1:24:58] their eyes compared to what they used to
[1:25:00] be they are rich increased with Goods
[1:25:01] because they have said they have go back
[1:25:04] even 20 years what they have now they
[1:25:06] never had about 20 years ago there and
[1:25:09] they say well look we're rich increased
[1:25:10] with Goods and so everywhere upon the
[1:25:12] earth comparable to where they used to
[1:25:15] be everyone as rich increased with goods
[1:25:17] that was their confession it wasn't mine
[1:25:21] amen now knowest and knowest not that
[1:25:25] thou art wretched
[1:25:26] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:25:30] naked this is God's diagnosis of this
[1:25:33] age I cancelled Eid to buy of me gold
[1:25:35] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:25:37] rich and white raiment that thou mayst
[1:25:40] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:25:42] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[1:25:44] eyes with eyesalve that thou may see as
[1:25:48] many as i love i rebuke and chasten be
[1:25:52] zealous therefore and repent as many as
[1:25:56] i love do anyway behold I stand at the
[1:25:59] door and knock If any man hear my voice
[1:26:02] and open the door I will come in to him
[1:26:05] and will sup with him and he with me
[1:26:07] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:26:10] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:26:13] overcame and sat down with my father in
[1:26:16] his throne he that hath an ear let him
[1:26:19] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:26:22] churches and that's how every leader
[1:26:24] finishes to him the heaven ear let him
[1:26:26] hear what the Spirit is saying amen
[1:26:29] so now we are rich increase with Goods
[1:26:33] this world is rich and crazy-good
[1:26:35] and this world's a he is saying I don't
[1:26:36] need anything and I could say this is
[1:26:39] even a far greater picture of this
[1:26:41] Western world man doesn't need anything
[1:26:44] but we have our healthcare we have our
[1:26:47] you know the state will look after us if
[1:26:49] we lose everything
[1:26:50] you know we have we have cars we have
[1:26:52] homes where food you know we have
[1:26:54] everything we need rich have need of
[1:26:56] nothing and so man thinks they don't
[1:26:59] need God but there always comes to a
[1:27:01] point in every life where the doctor
[1:27:03] says we can't do anything more
[1:27:06] unfortunately because medicine comes to
[1:27:09] an end and then what and then what's
[1:27:12] going to take you the rest of the way I
[1:27:13] mean that's why I'd rather know God now
[1:27:16] then maybe a deathbed confession I mean
[1:27:21] so now people say I've needed nothing
[1:27:22] now I want you to notice here he sees in
[1:27:26] but God's diagnosis as this world has
[1:27:28] Richard Miz rule naked blind and don't
[1:27:30] know it spiritually and then he calls
[1:27:35] him now as many as so but I counsel thee
[1:27:38] to buy of me gold tried in the
[1:27:40] that thou mayest be rich spiritually
[1:27:44] rich he's talking about he's not talking
[1:27:45] about natural gold here there's a deity
[1:27:47] golden the Bob where was his deity they
[1:27:49] mean it's a character that is molded and
[1:27:52] shaped in trial come and get it off me
[1:27:54] because God is looking for character
[1:27:56] this world is a characterless stage amen
[1:27:59] we're men aren't men and women aren't
[1:28:01] woman anymore
[1:28:01] everyone have a moral back backbone you
[1:28:04] know the vast majority right and white
[1:28:08] raiment that thou mayest be clothed
[1:28:09] spiritually clothed that they shame of
[1:28:11] thy nakedness do not appear in North
[1:28:13] iron eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest
[1:28:15] see on your glad you can see on young
[1:28:18] lady's got I serve in his word amen and
[1:28:21] as many as I love I rebuke and chasten
[1:28:24] be zealous therefore and repeat so this
[1:28:27] is now this verse next is being now the
[1:28:29] people he loves I mean many times they
[1:28:32] say well God loves me but he's got to
[1:28:34] love you you know I trust this is your
[1:28:37] so this so in this verse he does love us
[1:28:41] for God so loved the world he gave His
[1:28:42] only begotten Son
[1:28:43] but this verse says he's speaking of the
[1:28:45] object of his love and that's why he can
[1:28:48] say how do you know your love because
[1:28:50] his word comes in Crixus you know when
[1:28:52] you're doing wrong and there's something
[1:28:53] and you say you shouldn't do that the
[1:28:55] Bible says this you know God the Holy
[1:28:57] Spirit deals with you you know you know
[1:29:00] that when you you know that's God
[1:29:02] correcting because it you know you know
[1:29:05] to be chasing it's not just a not just a
[1:29:07] beating or whatever it's actually with
[1:29:09] correction and mine
[1:29:11] hallelujah so just as long as I'm his
[1:29:14] child he'll keep correcting me thank the
[1:29:16] Lord maybe they'll be zealous therefore
[1:29:19] and repent now we cover there comes a
[1:29:22] time here it says behold I stand at the
[1:29:25] door and knock and If any man hear my
[1:29:26] voice and open the door I will come in
[1:29:29] to him and will sup with him and he with
[1:29:31] me now
[1:29:32] many people take this scripture this is
[1:29:35] part of the same time many people take
[1:29:37] the scripture and they say this is Jesus
[1:29:39] knocking at the door of your heart he
[1:29:41] wants you to open your heart to him now
[1:29:43] in a sense that is true but this verse
[1:29:45] actually speaking out Jesus is on the
[1:29:46] outside of his church he's been kicked
[1:29:49] out he's been kicked out of the church
[1:29:51] he was once working among the church
[1:29:53] but now they took creeds and dogmas
[1:29:56] above the Word of God and he's kicked
[1:29:58] out so he's trying to get back in let me
[1:30:01] back into my church let me in but he's
[1:30:06] saying now but he's so standing at the
[1:30:08] door knocking and If any man hear my
[1:30:10] voice
[1:30:11] Amen you got to hear the voice of God
[1:30:13] that's what this message is the voice of
[1:30:15] God to this age hello and they say you
[1:30:18] open the door and he'll come into you
[1:30:20] and you heels up with you and he and and
[1:30:23] you with him now so let's just let's
[1:30:29] just one this up a little bit
[1:30:30] now listen so so what's what's mean to
[1:30:33] happen in this in this age now this
[1:30:37] there's to be a restoration of all
[1:30:39] things as as as Jesus says in Matthew 17
[1:30:45] Elisha shall come and restore all things
[1:30:47] there'll be a ministry with the
[1:30:48] anointing of Elijah to restore all
[1:30:50] things so Israel it'll be a gathering of
[1:30:53] Israel for them to receive the Messiah
[1:30:55] we know from the you know from the Bible
[1:30:58] that Israel still has a space of
[1:31:01] three-and-a-half years where grace goes
[1:31:03] back to Israel where God was working
[1:31:05] with the Gentiles now he goes back and
[1:31:07] deals with the Jews again Alleluia amen
[1:31:11] so now so there's a gathering of Israel
[1:31:13] for them to receive their Messiah and
[1:31:15] that's why Israel's a nation again
[1:31:17] because God always deals with the Jews
[1:31:19] when they're back in their homeland
[1:31:21] so they have been gathered that their
[1:31:24] Messiah would would would become known
[1:31:26] to them but before the Messiah becomes
[1:31:28] known to them the bride has taken up
[1:31:30] into glory amen and so now and so there
[1:31:35] has to be again so they've been gathered
[1:31:37] there's 144,000 he lectures that will
[1:31:39] receive the same Jesus Christ we know
[1:31:42] amen so so Israel's been gathered
[1:31:46] now they'll also be the opening of the
[1:31:48] bottomless pit if you read revelations
[1:31:50] chapter 9 right okay and then there'll
[1:31:53] be a binding as well of the tears and a
[1:31:55] gathering of the wheat and they'll also
[1:31:57] be the revealing of the Son of Man and
[1:31:59] Luke 17 30 says in the days of Noah and
[1:32:02] lot so shall it be when the Son of Man
[1:32:04] is revealed
[1:32:04] so the Ministry of Jesus Christ will
[1:32:06] repeat again and it's also an age of
[1:32:09] adoption where people come to their
[1:32:10] place in Christ amen where are people we
[1:32:14] know adoption in the Bible it's not it
[1:32:16] is it does not say going to China
[1:32:18] getting a baby you know and then now
[1:32:20] they're part of your family but adoption
[1:32:22] in the Bible is the placing of a child
[1:32:25] into the family so they've bought into
[1:32:27] the family already and then they come to
[1:32:29] a place of maturity where they're placed
[1:32:30] in the family I mean that that how they
[1:32:34] conduct the business is how the father
[1:32:35] would conduct the business so it's the
[1:32:37] placing of a placing of a son or
[1:32:39] daughter in a position of power and
[1:32:41] authority this is an adoption age I mean
[1:32:44] we're living the time of adoption where
[1:32:45] God is taking his bride lifting her up
[1:32:48] into heavenly places in Christ Jesus I
[1:32:50] mean because we're called to be joint
[1:32:52] heirs with him
[1:32:53] everything here is we fall we fall heir
[1:32:56] to you know God doesn't want us to be
[1:32:58] subservient to him amen we are joint we
[1:33:03] are joint equal with them because of
[1:33:05] what he has done for us
[1:33:07] amen now and then also as we just read
[1:33:10] Christ being rejected by the church
[1:33:12] knocking the church world knocking
[1:33:15] trying to get back in this has to happen
[1:33:17] and also the manifestation of the seal
[1:33:21] of God and the mark of the beast that
[1:33:24] will be fully manifested in this hour
[1:33:25] because those who are sealed with the
[1:33:27] seal of God will go on a rapture amen
[1:33:30] and there'll be those here who don't
[1:33:31] have the seal but they will stand for
[1:33:33] God and the Great Tribulation they'll
[1:33:35] give their lives we know that Amen but
[1:33:37] it also will be the manifestation of the
[1:33:39] mark of the beast will be in this hour
[1:33:41] and there will also be the rapture of
[1:33:43] the church amen and so and then also
[1:33:47] there'll be the image of the beast will
[1:33:49] be erected which it already has so that
[1:33:52] will happen as well a mint and you know
[1:33:56] so all these things have to be
[1:33:57] manifested in this day and the whole
[1:34:00] reason that all this goes on is because
[1:34:02] God is gathering amen he's gathering and
[1:34:05] the gospel has to be restored the
[1:34:07] restoration of all things and thus
[1:34:09] Gosselaar us we preached at the end of
[1:34:10] the world and then the end will come and
[1:34:12] that is happening amen
[1:34:15] so many of these things virtually all
[1:34:17] these things already
[1:34:18] already in manifestation hallelujah
[1:34:21] we're right at the end of all things
[1:34:23] there's a lot of a lot of things going
[1:34:24] on in this age and even though it is the
[1:34:27] darkest of all ages it is the most light
[1:34:30] amen
[1:34:31] we know stumbling in darkness with
[1:34:33] children of the day with children of
[1:34:34] light that's why we don't need to be
