[43:44] Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall
[43:46] upon Adam and he slipped and took one of
[43:47] his ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[43:49] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[43:52] had taken from man made a woman and
[43:55] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[43:57] this is now bone of my bones flesh of my
[44:00] flesh she shall be called woman because
[44:02] she was taken out of men therefore shall
[44:04] a man leave his father and his mother

[46:58] have preeminence in every life Lord may
[46:59] you grant it please and Jesus Christ
[47:01] name Amen amen god bless you friends you
[47:04] may have your seats this morning and I
[47:06] want to continue on well I call that
[47:09] pearl so we'll call it pearls part two
[47:11] but I want to speak about God's
[47:13] masterpiece in the seventh seal now we
[47:15] know that the seventh seal is a person
[47:18] who does Jesus Christ and hears he has
[47:20] come you know upon the earth two
[47:22] together a bride
[47:24] for himself and we understand that
[47:26] everything that the Lord has made he's
[47:28] made it for a purpose you know he didn't
[47:30] just make this earth just to see if he
[47:31] could make it he made it for a purpose
[47:33] you know he made the Sun not just to see
[47:35] if he could make the Sun but the Sun has
[47:37] a purpose every asteroid has a purpose
[47:39] every planet has a purpose every bug has
[47:42] a purpose every animal has a purpose
[47:44] upon the earth God all bacteria has a
[47:47] purpose
[47:47] amen to everything that God made there's
[47:50] a purpose in it being made and he didn't
[47:52] just make it just to see if he could
[47:54] make something a mint but he had a
[47:56] purpose in making it and is the same
[47:58] with you I mean we have a purpose we and
[48:01] we understand that that purpose is not
[48:03] just to be a person I mean it's not just
[48:05] to go through life and have children and
[48:08] you know have a job and a career even
[48:09] though that is part of it but that is
[48:11] not the purpose we are here but we are
[48:13] here upon the earth that God's Word
[48:15] would find a little boat in our soul and
[48:17] he had manifest himself through us I
[48:19] mean that we would be a living conduit
[48:21] of his power and glory I mean that is
[48:24] that is why we're here I mean I trust
[48:26] you have come to that realization you
[48:28] know you didn't just come into the
[48:29] message haphazardly
[48:31] I mean God ordained your footsteps he
[48:33] knew how old you'd be he knew the
[48:34] situation in life you'd be and I mean
[48:37] but he and he preordained a season where
[48:40] he would meet you hallelujah and he did
[48:43] it for a purpose now brother Brahim says
[48:46] in the greatest battle ever fought he
[48:49] says and I thought of the order of that
[48:51] heavenly hosts so speaking of the Stars
[48:54] not one of them's out of place
[48:56] everyone's kept its time perfectly God's
[48:59] great army I thought of the soldiers how
[49:02] that if the moon would happen to get out
[49:05] of order the earth would be covered with
[49:06] water just in a few minutes the earth
[49:09] would be just like it was when God
[49:11] decided to use a to have here on it it
[49:14] was without form and void and darkness
[49:16] and water was on the Britt's of the
[49:18] earth earth and if that moon would ever
[49:21] move it would do the same again when the
[49:24] moon rocks a little away from the earth
[49:26] the tides come up and when it goes down
[49:28] it just follows the tides it's God's
[49:30] great army and when I thought of that
[49:33] being God's great army there now I went
[49:36] to bed and when I begin to think
[49:38] that not one of those get out of their
[49:41] place they all sit in place if there's a
[49:45] moving anywhere out of them it'll cause
[49:48] that will affect this earth we just see
[49:51] the effects of it now from some of their
[49:54] moving into other spots it's effective
[49:57] it affects everything and I thought then
[49:59] if that great heavenly host like that
[50:01] has to keep its place to make everything
[50:04] in order what about the disorder of the
[50:07] heavenly host what about when one of us
[50:09] gets out of order how it throws the
[50:11] whole thing out of cater the whole
[50:13] program of God is upset when one member
[50:15] gets out of order
[50:17] we should continually strive to keep the
[50:19] order of the Spirit and I would to God
[50:22] this morning that we would bring this to
[50:24] a real healing service that we would
[50:27] keep this part this group that we have
[50:29] gathered under the roof this morning and
[50:30] such a harmony that the holy holy spirit
[50:34] would place every member of the body
[50:36] here this morning in such harmony till
[50:38] there be a spontaneous healing of soul
[50:41] and body F we'll just hold our positions
[50:45] hallelujah
[50:46] and he says and I and he says and as I
[50:49] said at the beginning this lady that had
[50:52] cancer that dr. Holbrook was going to
[50:54] take off now that God that just caused
[50:57] the fluttering noise to come into the
[50:59] coming to that clinic and that cancer
[51:01] without even leaving a scar didn't know
[51:04] don't you know that that same God's here
[51:07] the only thing he is waiting for us to
[51:09] get his army to get to position like the
[51:12] Stars get to position Amen think of the
[51:15] power of that where you know if we could
[51:18] just get in one mind one heart one
[51:22] Accord he says there be a spontaneous
[51:25] healing of soul and body
[51:27] hallelujah many times people could dwell
[51:29] on the negative of people getting out of
[51:31] order but I think we should dwell on the
[51:32] positive people getting in position I
[51:34] mean how much more powerful win went
[51:36] God's great army you think about God's
[51:39] incredible masterpiece other people that
[51:41] all have their own opinion they all have
[51:43] their own personality they all have
[51:45] their own ambition but yet they've
[51:46] surrendered their well completely to the
[51:48] Lord and then God moves them into
[51:50] harmony with us word hallelujah and with
[51:52] one another I mean that that that the
[51:54] whole Ransome body of God can move as
[51:56] one unit can move as one great army
[51:59] hallelujah don't you want to be part of
[52:01] that number amen
[52:04] so I think it's very powerful if we
[52:06] recognize that we are called for a
[52:08] purpose now Jesus would know I think
[52:12] I'll just jump to this quickly you know
[52:13] and I'll come back but you know this is
[52:16] just from I just took a bit from brother
[52:18] Dottie Reagan's sermon or from the
[52:20] Easter youth came about we need power
[52:21] and he brought out in there that the
[52:24] devil knows that he has power he knows
[52:27] his position let's go to let's go to
[52:30] Luke 4 let's just read a bit but it's a
[52:32] different kind of power than what we
[52:34] have but I want you to recognize that
[52:37] the devil knows has he knows his
[52:39] boundaries
[52:40] he knows his position he knows his
[52:43] authority and he's not afraid to use it
[52:45] he does not shrink back you know I'm not
[52:48] worthy to be Satan today no he just
[52:50] takes what he is and he just uses it to
[52:53] its full extent that he's allowed to use
[52:55] it I meant let's go to look for he says
[52:59] here to Jesus now notice this here look
[53:03] for an and and verse 5 and the devil
[53:07] taking him up into a high mountain
[53:09] showed and to him all the kingdoms of
[53:12] the world in a moment of time and the
[53:15] devil said unto him all this power will
[53:18] I give thee and the glory of them for
[53:21] that is delivered unto me and to
[53:23] whomsoever I I will give it if thou wilt
[53:27] if thou therefore will worship me all
[53:30] shall be thine now notice Jesus does
[53:34] notice what Jesus is that jesus answered
[53:36] said unto him get thee behind me Satan
[53:38] for his written thou shalt worship the
[53:40] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[53:42] serve so he doesn't say no you're a liar
[53:44] Satan no you have no right to you have
[53:47] no power to give the kingdoms of the
[53:48] world to me he did not he did not tell
[53:51] him he actually was actually agreeing
[53:52] yes you have this power but this power
[53:55] is not the power that we're in dude when
[53:57] the Holy Ghost comes upon us but this
[53:59] powers are designated it's a sense of
[54:02] ability it's a privilege
[54:04] it's a delegated influence it's a
[54:06] jurisdiction amen so it's actually a
[54:09] it's a it's a delegated influence he's
[54:12] allowed this position right so so so the
[54:16] devil knows his position the devil knows
[54:19] his place and he is not afraid to
[54:21] operate from that place he's very
[54:24] willing he's very able
[54:25] he doesn't shrink back but when it comes
[54:28] to us how different it is to us where we
[54:31] shrink back and we and we take a step
[54:33] back when the devil starts to intimidate
[54:35] us and and and get on our case and
[54:37] challenge us how we shrink back too many
[54:39] times we should never be afraid of the
[54:42] devil's devices we should never be
[54:44] worried about what he's doing I mean
[54:47] because how God has made us greater than
[54:49] the devil I mean we are not a servant
[54:51] angels we know a servants right but we
[54:53] are family we are sons and daughters and
[54:55] when you take a natural you know a
[54:57] natural monarchy I mean the children of
[54:59] the king and queen have greater
[55:01] authority than even the best servant in
[55:03] the kingdom because the the servants not
[55:06] family right but they but the children
[55:09] are family amen but the devil always
[55:11] tries to punch it who we are and
[55:14] challenge who we are we shouldn't shrink
[55:17] back if God has made us thus we have us
[55:21] hallelujah if he's made me the bride I
[55:24] am the bride I can't help being the
[55:26] bride the moon can't help being the moon
[55:28] Satan can't help being sent on earth
[55:30] can't help being earth
[55:31] you know they can't help but the Sun
[55:33] can't help being the Sun because God
[55:35] made it thus I'm in a you know a blue
[55:38] Wow can't help being a blue well it'll
[55:40] do what blue whales do because it's made
[55:42] a blue whale hallelujah and if we are
[55:44] the sons and daughters of God I mean we
[55:46] can't if we just give our will to the
[55:48] Lord we do not try and pick it back up
[55:51] again then we will not be able to help
[55:53] being the bride I mean you can't build
[55:56] it because you made thus hallelujah so
[56:01] the devil he knows his position do you
[56:05] know yours amen
[56:09] we're here too we have to recognize the
[56:13] power in the body
[56:14] Alleluia the absolute power
[56:18] that is that is part of you know don't
[56:20] get nervous when I talk about these
[56:22] things because always get worried do I
[56:25] have the ability do I have the right to
[56:27] stand on my god-given privileges
[56:29] absolutely have the right amen
[56:32] you know if I gave you you know I know
[56:35] if I use the illustration before but you
[56:37] know if someone gave to you some some
[56:40] Island and you know some some some
[56:43] little paradise island somewhere
[56:44] tropical island
[56:45] he says it's yours would you go claim it
[56:48] you wouldn't be afraid you'll be oh I'm
[56:51] not worthy I'm poor I'm richer you know
[56:53] I can't you know no you would you would
[56:55] you would get there he would take
[56:58] possession of what belong to you what
[57:00] was given amen
[57:01] how much more yeah but but we wouldn't
[57:04] look in ourselves and say well am i
[57:05] worthy to live on that island no you
[57:08] just go get it wouldn't you well how
[57:10] much more now eternal life how much more
[57:13] the power of God amen
[57:15] how much more him dwelling in us how
[57:17] much more us coming to our position
[57:20] hallelujah Amen a if the Lord said that
[57:22] we shall knows we are knowing now we're
[57:25] living in that day I remember we we need
[57:27] to stop looking at ourselves by our
[57:30] perception what I think of myself
[57:32] doesn't matter
[57:34] Amen now what he thinks of me is the
[57:37] only opinion that matters
[57:40] amen but how much power does when people
[57:42] walk in harmony you you notice the
[57:44] children of Israel I mean when they when
[57:46] they cross the Jordan into the Promised
[57:48] Land they were moving as one body I mean
[57:51] they believe the land was theirs and
[57:53] when as long as they were walking in
[57:55] step with the promise they didn't lose a
[57:56] man they won every victory God
[57:59] supernaturally came down and conquered
[58:00] their enemies for them amen and that's
[58:03] just a shadow of you Allu you know it's
[58:07] Esau yo in Psalms 133 behold how good
[58:10] and how pleasant it is for brethren to
[58:12] dwell together in unity amen it's like
[58:15] the precious ointment upon the head that
[58:17] ran down upon the the beard even Aaron's
[58:21] beard I mean that went down to the
[58:23] skirts of his garments so you know David
[58:27] or whoever wrote the psalm is saying
[58:28] this is what unity does because
[58:31] had to be anointed with the anointing
[58:33] oil in order to to exercise the office
[58:36] of high priest I'm in here to be
[58:38] anointed in order to go in and and go to
[58:41] the Holy of Holies and offer the blood
[58:43] on behalf of the people and he's saying
[58:45] this is what unity is like you can
[58:47] actually the body can actually function
[58:49] as it's meant to function hallelujah
[58:52] amen and so how you know we are we have
[58:56] a function we have an office to to
[58:59] exercise like the high priest he had a
[59:02] job right he had a job he was ordained
[59:05] to that job hallelujah we're ordained to
[59:08] a job amen now we're it well we didn't
[59:13] but I mentioned last last last Sunday
[59:17] how Rebecca was found by a well outside
[59:21] the promised land but then she was taken
[59:23] by Eleazar into the Promised Land and
[59:27] Isaac was dwelling in the South Country
[59:30] and he came from the way of the well of
[59:33] llaha Rory and there in the Eventide
[59:36] Isaac and Rebecca came together so now
[59:40] Rebecca was going to live by different
[59:42] well hallelujah it wasn't a well where
[59:46] she is from
[59:46] it was a different well and the name
[59:49] llaha Rory
[59:50] that means it's it's the well of a
[59:54] living one my seer the well of him that
[59:56] liveth and see if me amen to the well
[59:59] the well that she came to was in the
[1:00:02] promised land now our promised land is
[1:00:04] Christ right and we do not have a well
[1:00:07] that just trickles I mean that you know
[1:00:10] we don't have a well that has stopped up
[1:00:12] in every season maybe in the winter it
[1:00:14] flows in the summer is dry I mean that's
[1:00:17] not the world we have we have a well of
[1:00:19] living water that gushes forth
[1:00:22] hallelujah and as Jesus would say he met
[1:00:26] a woman at the well and this was a
[1:00:29] Jacob's Well but he was going to
[1:00:31] introduce her to another well and that
[1:00:34] well was living water I will give unto
[1:00:37] the living water not just natural water
[1:00:39] but living water and she begins to say
[1:00:42] well sir thou has nothing to draw with
[1:00:44] the well is deep
[1:00:45] whence hast thou living water are there
[1:00:48] greater than our Father Jacob which gave
[1:00:50] us the well and drank thereof himself
[1:00:52] and his children and his cattle and
[1:00:54] jesus answered unto her whosoever
[1:00:56] drinketh of this water shall thirst
[1:00:57] again but whosoever drinketh of the
[1:01:00] water that I shall give him shall never
[1:01:02] thirst but the water that I shall give
[1:01:04] him shall be in him a well of water
[1:01:07] springing up into everlasting life
[1:01:09] hallelujah and we know the rest of the
[1:01:11] conversation where you know he said go
[1:01:13] get your husband and and and he know she
[1:01:16] said well I have them then he says your
[1:01:19] that's right you've had six and the one
[1:01:20] you I mean you've had five the one you
[1:01:22] worth is not even yours you know and
[1:01:24] then he revealed to her that he was the
[1:01:26] Messiah it changed the whole life
[1:01:28] now she was now she was manifesting a
[1:01:31] different water a mint now was flowing
[1:01:34] from her a different kind of life
[1:01:35] hallelujah amen and it's the same thing
[1:01:39] it's exactly the same thing with us so
[1:01:44] yeah I just want to we're here for a
[1:01:45] purpose
[1:01:46] that God would flow that its word would
[1:01:48] manifest itself I mean but more than
[1:01:51] just an anointing that comes and goes
[1:01:52] but an abiding presence I mean with God
[1:01:55] your God us in Isaiah heaven is my
[1:01:58] throne earth is my footstool but where
[1:01:59] is the place of my rest he's saying I
[1:02:01] made all things but where's a place I
[1:02:03] can rest hallelujah I made the solar
[1:02:05] system I made the galaxies I made
[1:02:07] everything but where is the place of my
[1:02:09] rest and your response should be Here I
[1:02:12] am because the human soul is the place
[1:02:15] of God's rest said Lord here's a place
[1:02:17] you can take your rest I mean here's a
[1:02:19] place where you can make your abode amen
[1:02:22] hallelujah that's what we are we are the
[1:02:25] place of his rest
[1:02:26] Amen but he is now but if we're the
[1:02:29] place of his rest I say he's not just
[1:02:31] asleep
[1:02:31] he's living he's working hallelujah he's
[1:02:36] affecting those around us amen so now he
[1:02:43] season so Jesus so Rebecca was living by
[1:02:47] different well and now we begin to live
[1:02:49] by different well I mean we don't we're
[1:02:51] you know we're not drinking from some
[1:02:53] stagnated pull that gets common or get
[1:02:56] stupid or bugs growing at your brother
[1:02:58] and preaches
[1:02:59] yo bro consistence he goes that Jeremiah
[1:03:03] says that they have forsaken their
[1:03:05] forsaken me
[1:03:06] you know Springs of the Living God and
[1:03:08] have hewn themselves out cisterns amen
[1:03:11] we don't have a system we don't have a
[1:03:13] man-made tank that everything from the
[1:03:15] world just gets washed into it and then
[1:03:17] we have a spring of living water
[1:03:19] hallelujah the water we have flows out
[1:03:21] it doesn't flow in and sense I mean it
[1:03:24] flows out hallelujah there's a force
[1:03:26] behind and that's flowing out hallelujah
[1:03:28] trust that's every one of you there's a
[1:03:31] life pulsating for bezu there's a
[1:03:33] there's something pushing hallelujah I
[1:03:36] trust that's you and your life order I
[1:03:38] know yeah
[1:03:40] I'm not saying well do you have to feel
[1:03:42] on cloud nine every yo all day no I'm
[1:03:46] not meaning that but there should be a
[1:03:47] life that's flowing there should be a
[1:03:49] force like Brother Bear master you know
[1:03:51] well he didn't ask the stream buddy see

[1:04:56] Spirit which they that believe on him
[1:04:59] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[1:05:01] not yet given because Jesus was not yet
[1:05:03] glorified and he's is fairly fairly this

[1:06:10] himself upon the earth that's what the
[1:06:12] brightest for hallelujah we are his body
[1:06:14] upon the earth I mean we're not here
[1:06:16] just to debate and argue and have some
[1:06:18] kind of lifestyle no that's not what the

[1:07:00] in his disciples hallelujah that's the
[1:07:02] same thing with you and I he doesn't
[1:07:04] just want to be with you
[1:07:05] our God's here no he wants to be in you
[1:07:07] he wants to come and dwell in your soul
[1:07:09] hallelujah I'm glad that's the case
[1:07:13] aren't you hallelujah but never ever let
[1:07:17] the devil said you can't never obtain to
[1:07:20] that because the devil he thinks you
[1:07:23] have to earn it look at all his
[1:07:25] religions
[1:07:26] people go on pilgrimages and they crawl
[1:07:29] up steps and they say how merry so they
[1:07:31] rub feet of statues they do all kinds of
[1:07:33] crazy things
[1:07:34] cause it's man trying to obtain
[1:07:36] something we're not here to obtain
[1:07:38] something we're here to give ourselves
[1:07:40] to him and then he takes us a mean and
[1:07:43] transforms us into the image of his word
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:47] you know we had a we had a company
[1:07:50] conference you know and one of the
[1:07:52] keynote keynote speakers was says you
[1:07:55] know you've got to transform yourself I
[1:07:57] thought my no because I'll end up
[1:08:02] disappointed at me if I try and I'll
[1:08:05] turn over a new leaf it just turns back
[1:08:06] again all my good intentions just get
[1:08:09] thrown away you know I thought man no
[1:08:12] God has to do the transforming Allu yeah
[1:08:17] now so out of now Jesus season in John
[1:08:23] 14 14 and 12 he says verily verily I say
[1:08:28] unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:08:31] works I do shall he do also and greater
[1:08:35] than these shall he do because he
[1:08:38] because I go unto my father and
[1:08:40] whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that
[1:08:43] will I do that the father may be
[1:08:45] glorified in the son if you ask anything
[1:08:48] in my name I will do it so he is making
[1:08:52] a declaration he that believeth on him
[1:08:54] the works that I do shall he do also now
[1:08:58] let's just let's just think about that
[1:09:00] for a second what works did he do he
[1:09:02] cast out Satan he raised the dead he
[1:09:05] healed the sick I mean he restored the
[1:09:08] sight of the blind he opened people's
[1:09:10] understandings to who they really were
[1:09:12] right but the greater works is the
[1:09:14] impartation of eternal life amen that we
[1:09:19] can actually impart eternal life to
[1:09:21] others amen
[1:09:23] Peter went to Cornelius house now God
[1:09:26] always works for his body
[1:09:28] Peter Peter is you know he's in Joppa
[1:09:31] and he's praying or you know he falls
[1:09:33] into his a trance and he sees the other
[1:09:35] sheet with all the unclean animals you
[1:09:37] know and God says go slay and eat and
[1:09:39] all those things
[1:09:40] I think God says to me you know don't
[1:09:42] call what I've called clean unclean and
[1:09:44] then some men and then an angel before
[1:09:46] that go yo speaks to Cornelius who's a
[1:09:49] Gentile and and you know the angel says
[1:09:51] to me Oh your arms have come up before
[1:09:53] God now therefore go send men to Joppa
[1:09:56] you'll find Simon you'll find Simon
[1:09:58] Peter amen and he'll tell you the words
[1:10:01] of eternal life so then so then they go
[1:10:03] under expectation the men go to cut
[1:10:05] young you know go get Peter and then he
[1:10:08] comes Peter and then you know he begins
[1:10:11] to speak about the resurrection and how
[1:10:13] Jesus Christ is alive what God is doing
[1:10:15] in their day and while yet Peter spake
[1:10:17] these words the Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:10:19] them they received eternal life what
[1:10:22] happens through the body
[1:10:23] turtle life was imparted hallelujah he
[1:10:26] say well I'm not a preacher you don't
[1:10:28] have to be a preacher to give eternal
[1:10:30] life I meant every part of the body
[1:10:32] every part of the body is ordained to
[1:10:35] cast out devils to to lay hands on the
[1:10:37] sick and they shall recover to speak in
[1:10:39] new tongues all those things that we've
[1:10:41] been designated I mean that's every part
[1:10:43] of the body amen hallelujah
[1:10:46] I mean we should look into our equipment
[1:10:49] bag and dig out some things and start
[1:10:51] putting them into action we should never
[1:10:54] be afraid or I can't do it no if God has
[1:10:56] commissioned you I mean they're very God
[1:10:58] that said the disciples went in the
[1:11:00] disciples hallelujah and he did the work
[1:11:02] I mean it's exactly the same with us we
[1:11:05] shouldn't just shrink back and say well
[1:11:07] I'm just a garden-variety Christian
[1:11:09] hallelujah if you're a garden-variety
[1:11:11] Christian Amen you know brother Bram
[1:11:14] said when the weakest of Christians gets
[1:11:16] on their knees the kingdom of Hell
[1:11:18] shakes
[1:11:19] hallelujah so even if you say you well
[1:11:22] I'm weak in the faith where you can
[1:11:23] still shake hell I mean you can still
[1:11:26] upset the devil's program
[1:11:27] I'm not strong in faith you don't need
[1:11:29] to worry about how you feel just take
[1:11:31] God at His Word that's all you need to
[1:11:33] do amen no brother Brown says he says we
[1:11:41] realize who we are wait where are we
[1:11:44] three two okay realize who we are
[1:11:48] we'll do the greater work since if we
[1:11:50] realize that he be he has become flesh
[1:11:52] in us oh sorry this is actually
[1:11:54] me so we're going to realize who who we
[1:11:57] are then we will do the greater works
[1:11:59] since if we realize that he has become
[1:12:01] flesh on us he has come in his bright
[1:12:04] form which is us white we realize that
[1:12:06] we can impart eternal life healing
[1:12:09] deliverance comfort peace because it's
[1:12:13] him in us manifesting through us we're
[1:12:16] here for a purpose
[1:12:17] amen hallelujah that brother is now
[1:12:22] notices is that down Calvary now notice
[1:12:24] the greater works was to have the power
[1:12:26] and the church not only to heal the sick
[1:12:28] by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but
[1:12:31] to impart eternal life to believers the
[1:12:34] Holy Ghost was coming and given into the
[1:12:36] hands of the church to impart life oh
[1:12:38] that's what Calvary meant it it took
[1:12:42] stooped degraded men and woman and
[1:12:44] lifted them into a place to be sons and
[1:12:46] daughters of God to heal the sick to
[1:12:48] impart eternal life by giving the Holy
[1:12:51] Ghost to obedient believers men who at
[1:12:54] once unbelievers be made believers and
[1:12:56] apart spiritual eternal life how much
[1:12:58] greater is it hallelujah
[1:13:01] that's what Calvary who came to achieve
[1:13:02] I mean their God would take a people I
[1:13:05] was once stooped and degraded that but
[1:13:09] that was in the past
[1:13:11] that's not who I am now hallelujah
[1:13:14] amen we should never let our past derail
[1:13:18] our future my future sees I'm dancing on
[1:13:21] the streets of gold that's my
[1:13:22] destination doesn't matter where I came
[1:13:25] from it's where I'm going I mean the
[1:13:27] devil came from being the anointed
[1:13:29] cherub that covereth
[1:13:30] he's going to burn in the lake of fire
[1:13:31] so so he came from the throne but he's
[1:13:35] going to the lake of fire
[1:13:36] hallelujah we came from sin and darkness
[1:13:38] I mean but we're going to the throne
[1:13:40] hallelujah so we should just rejoice now
[1:13:47] Jesus says annex one he says but ye
[1:13:51] shall receive power after the Holy Ghost
[1:13:54] has come upon you and you shall be
[1:13:56] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[1:13:58] in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the
[1:14:04] uttermost parts of the earth now this
[1:14:07] word power
[1:14:08] as different to the one that I mentioned
[1:14:10] about Satan having power remember the
[1:14:12] one that Satan's had all this power will
[1:14:15] I give thee was a designated influence
[1:14:17] it was a privilege it was a jurisdiction
[1:14:21] but this power that is spoken about next
[1:14:24] one is the Greek word Dunamis where we
[1:14:28] get the word dynamite from hallelujah so
[1:14:32] we have a different kind of we have a
[1:14:33] different kind of power I mean it's not
[1:14:36] just a designated Authority I mean but
[1:14:38] it's a power it's a dynamite power
[1:14:40] hallelujah I mean this is you shall
[1:14:43] receive power which is a force I mean
[1:14:46] specifically a miraculous power I'm in
[1:14:49] it is a strength that's a violent that's
[1:14:51] mighty wonderful works it's an abundance
[1:14:54] and it's an ability I mean so when you
[1:14:56] receive this power from on high which is
[1:14:58] the Holy Ghost you're given an ability
[1:15:00] to overcome all things I mean you give
[1:15:03] an ability to overcome all complexes I
[1:15:05] mean you're you've been given ability to
[1:15:07] overcome all the things from your past
[1:15:08] and we carry a lot of scars you can even
[1:15:12] look upon the earth itself this earth is
[1:15:14] going to be renovated it's going to be a
[1:15:17] new heavens and new earth it's going to
[1:15:18] change from what it is to a new but you
[1:15:21] look you go look at the great mountain
[1:15:22] yo ranges and things you can see all the
[1:15:24] strata of the rocks and sometimes the
[1:15:27] strata is going up like this it's not
[1:15:29] going flat why was heaven there's been a
[1:15:30] violent there's been a violent
[1:15:32] earthquake has thrust up I mean all of
[1:15:35] the rock who's seen it what's happening
[1:15:37] this earth has Scouse it has pain if I
[1:15:42] can put it that way it is scars but
[1:15:45] those scars are not going to stop it
[1:15:46] becoming a new heavens and new earth
[1:15:48] because God has ordained that it will
[1:15:50] become new again hallelujah now if the
[1:15:54] earth can be that way
[1:15:55] remember we have an eternal body waiting
[1:15:58] hallelujah we are we are gonna when we
[1:16:01] read in the scripture that he will come
[1:16:03] and wipe away all tears from our eyes
[1:16:05] that is literally going to happen we're
[1:16:07] going to be at the wedding supper table
[1:16:09] he'll come out in his glory and he'll
[1:16:11] come one by one wipe off all the tears
[1:16:13] all the pain it's all over children I
[1:16:16] mean you can rejoice it's all over
[1:16:19] hallelujah amen but see the earth the
[1:16:22] earth has to get rid of all these scars
[1:16:24] cuz God's ordained you can see all the
[1:16:27] fossil record great violence has
[1:16:29] happened upon the earth and has passed
[1:16:30] many things have been killed in
[1:16:32] cataclysmic floods and earthquakes and
[1:16:35] all kinds of terrible things that happen
[1:16:37] on it so it carries a lot of scars but
[1:16:39] it's not going to stay with those scars
[1:16:42] hallelujah we carry scars amen now I
[1:16:47] didn't expect the hallelujah but you
[1:16:49] know we all carry scars but those scars
[1:16:53] are not ordained to hold us back I mean
[1:16:56] they're not ordained amen to stop us
[1:16:58] becoming what we call to be hallelujah
[1:17:02] we should just look at those things you
[1:17:04] say well I've got scars from my past but
[1:17:07] rejoice you're no longer that person
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:10] they don't affect you no more I trust
[1:17:12] they don't I mean because the Lord lifts
[1:17:14] you I mean from the effect of that scar
[1:17:17] hallelujah
[1:17:18] isn't a wonderful thing you know the
[1:17:19] devil puts pain and wounding in our
[1:17:22] spirits and he uses it as a doorway he
[1:17:26] use it as a doorway that that the person
[1:17:28] that did it to you
[1:17:29] may never be in your life ever again but
[1:17:31] someone else comes in and uh you know
[1:17:33] and somehow because that sky you relate
[1:17:35] to that person as you did the person

[1:17:39] sky and you begin to react the way that
[1:17:41] you never expected why cause it's a
[1:17:43] doorway but how glorious it is when the
[1:17:47] Lord comes and he shuts that door
[1:17:51] hallelujah he shuts down the devil's
[1:17:54] ability to use your past against you
[1:17:56] hallelujah amen
[1:17:59] but then white Lord came and doesn't
[1:18:02] bother me no more hallelujah why cause

[1:21:22] sure people can backslide or whatever
[1:21:24] more but if you're one of God's you'll
[1:21:25] come back I mean he won't he won't leave
[1:21:28] you he won't leave you in that
[1:21:30] backslidden state hallelujah he take the
[1:21:34] I was gonna make making it to a whole
[1:21:36] service but here we are you take the man
[1:21:38] go Jesus was asked by a Pharisee or a
[1:21:40] scribe who's my neighbor Oh deep yeah
[1:21:43] you know who's my neighbor then Jesus
[1:21:45] told the parable a certain man was going
[1:21:47] from Jerusalem to Jericho
[1:21:49] Jerusalem's up here Jericho's low what's
[1:21:53] happening here is backsliding
[1:21:54] Jerusalem's up on the hill Jericho's
[1:21:56] down in the valley he is backsliding as
[1:21:58] he was backsliding the enemy got him he
[1:22:00] was beaten and torn up by robbers what's
[1:22:03] happening because backsliding always has
[1:22:04] an effect amen
[1:22:06] but then the people who should have been
[1:22:08] able to help remember we've got power
[1:22:10] we've got passage deliverer we've got
[1:22:12] power to heal got power to comfort amen
[1:22:15] so he comes the Levite sees the man
[1:22:17] can't help him walks on he comes a
[1:22:19] priest or whatever more but then a
[1:22:21] Samaritan comes along Samaritans were
[1:22:24] hated by the Jews you know the Bible
[1:22:26] says warn to you if all men speak good
[1:22:28] of you it's actually said why you're in
[1:22:31] a bad state if everyone likes you what
[1:22:34] does that mean I've got to make an enemy
[1:22:35] No
[1:22:35] if God's in you the devil's your enemy
[1:22:38] and he'll anoint people to come against
[1:22:40] you amen so now here comes a Samaritan
[1:22:43] who's hated by the juice but he's
[1:22:45] carrying oil and wine he's got what he's
[1:22:48] got what this man needs he's packing a
[1:22:52] man we've got power
[1:22:53] hallelujah here it comes with the oil
[1:22:56] and the wine and the and then he binds
[1:22:57] up the man's you know isn't it strange
[1:22:59] why would you pour oil and wine into
[1:23:01] words that doesn't sound like good
[1:23:03] medical sense but Jesus speaking of
[1:23:05] parable oil is the Holy Ghost and the
[1:23:08] wine is a stimulation of the revelation
[1:23:10] so now here's this man who's half dead
[1:23:12] on the floor and in this Samaritan comes
[1:23:14] long pause on the oil and wine binds up
[1:23:16] as wounds I mean what begins to show the
[1:23:19] word term encourages them it's a right
[1:23:21] brother amen you're one of them
[1:23:23] hallelujah it'll be okay isn't the Lord
[1:23:26] wonderful amen yo and then and then all
[1:23:28] the pain of the wounds begins to go away
[1:23:30] because they're now bound up with oil
[1:23:31] and wine and then the Samaritan puts him
[1:23:34] on his own beast as I'm power amen takes
[1:23:37] them into the end which is the church
[1:23:38] and tears to the pastor look after this
[1:23:41] one here's two pence or whatever it is
[1:23:42] and if you need any more I'll pay it
[1:23:45] when I come back I'll ooh yeah glory say
[1:23:49] you know we should just rejoice we have
[1:23:52] we have oil and wine
[1:23:54] amen we have what we need to help each
[1:23:57] other Allu yeah you just think you know
[1:24:00] you can be all down and downcast you
[1:24:02] begin to think about the Lord a little
[1:24:03] bit amen should make you happy
[1:24:07] hey you should be able to just yeah it
[1:24:09] just changes the whole mood around the
[1:24:10] place and then someone else comes a
[1:24:13] brother or sister comes along they can
[1:24:15] see you down there we're going to talk
[1:24:16] to you
[1:24:16] amen fellowship begins to happen and
[1:24:19] then what happens is you may be down or
[1:24:22] worried about something your burn is now
[1:24:24] a lighter brighter is your way
[1:24:26] everything is not so bad after all why
[1:24:30] because they have oil and why hallelujah
[1:24:34] amen so now we were going to look
[1:24:36] weren't we
[1:24:37] 24:49 and he says behold I will see in
[1:24:43] the promise of my father upon you but
[1:24:48] tarry ye in Jerusalem and in the city of
[1:24:51] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:24:54] from on high that that word power again
[1:24:58] is the Dunamis the dynamite power
[1:25:00] hallelujah but to be endued it means in
[1:25:04] the sense of sinking into a garment the
[1:25:07] definition is to invest with clothing I
[1:25:09] mean to be a raid to be closed worth
[1:25:12] just now we put on a jacket we put on he
[1:25:16] actually says you're gonna be in Jude
[1:25:17] you're gonna be clothed with this power
[1:25:20] hallelujah
[1:25:21] you're gonna be endued with it so now
[1:25:23] it's part of your being amen it's not
[1:25:26] just a you know it's not just a
[1:25:28] temporary anointing but it's always
[1:25:29] there
[1:25:30] amen it says in 1st Corinthians 4 and 20
[1:25:36] I'm gonna read a few of these for the
[1:25:37] kingdom of God is not in word but in
[1:25:39] power but in Dunamis amen
[1:25:42] as he the first Thessalonians 1 and fire
[1:25:45] for our gospel came not unto you in word
[1:25:47] only but also in power and in the Holy
[1:25:49] Ghost and a much assurance as you know
[1:25:52] what men are of men we were among you
[1:25:54] for your sake I mean see saying now that
[1:25:57] the gospel didn't come just in word only
[1:25:58] but in power came and Dunamis I mean
[1:26:01] we've got dynamite power hallelujah
[1:26:04] we just have a designated Authority I
[1:26:06] mean we got dynamite power
[1:26:08] hallelujah and in much assurance amen so
[1:26:13] now I just read this he says this is
[1:26:17] from the from the church age book let me
[1:26:20] show you another reason why Satan hates
[1:26:22] this book of revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:26:24] in the church he knows that Jesus Christ
[1:26:27] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:26:29] and any changes not he knows that a
[1:26:31] whole lot more than do 90% of the
[1:26:34] theologians he knows that since God is
[1:26:36] immutable in his nature he's just as
[1:26:38] immutable in his ways the Satan knows
[1:26:41] assuredly that the original church at
[1:26:43] Pentecost with the power of God marked
[1:26:44] 16 in action as the true church that
[1:26:47] Jesus claims his own all houses false it
[1:26:49] has to be now remember this the church
[1:26:52] I'm sorry Christ and the true church is
[1:26:55] a continuation of the book of Acts but
[1:26:57] the book of Revelation shows how that
[1:26:59] the Antichrist spirit would come into
[1:27:01] the church and defile it making it
[1:27:03] lukewarm formal and powerless and
[1:27:05] exposes Satan revealing his works which
[1:27:07] is the attempted destruction of God's
[1:27:09] people and the discrediting of God's
[1:27:11] work right down to the time he's cast
[1:27:13] into the lake of fire he fights that he
[1:27:15] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:27:17] people get the true revelation of the
[1:27:19] true church and what she is and what she
[1:27:22] stands for then that she can do the
[1:27:24] greater works she will be an invincible
[1:27:27] army if they get a true revelation of
[1:27:30] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:27:32] the Christian Church and by God's Spirit
[1:27:34] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:27:36] spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:27:38] her he will be definitely thought of
[1:27:41] today as when Christ will stood as every
[1:27:43] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:27:45] desert yes Satan hates revelation but we
[1:27:47] love it with true revelation in our
[1:27:49] lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail
[1:27:51] against us but we will prevail over them
[1:27:55] I mean so if we get the true revelation
[1:27:58] of the true church and what she is what
[1:28:01] she stands for and that she can do the
[1:28:04] greater work she will be an invincible
[1:28:06] army now I just want to drop and right
[1:28:09] here we aren't just endured with power
[1:28:11] to do miracles I mean but wearing Judith
[1:28:13] pathan love the word Amen Satan
[1:28:16] can make no say thing could definitely
[1:28:18] preach better than me he could quote
[1:28:20] better than me he could well definitely
[1:28:22] sing a lot better than me but you know
[1:28:23] but one thing he cannot do is live the
[1:28:26] word he does not have the ability to
[1:28:29] live the entire scripture he cannot do
[1:28:32] it so the power he has can never enable
[1:28:34] him amen to live the word to live right
[1:28:37] I mean but the power we are endued with
[1:28:39] I mean causes the believer to live the
[1:28:42] word hallelujah you know that's why I
[1:28:45] think God changes your nature amen
[1:28:47] that's all he needs to do USA Lord
[1:28:51] changed my nature so it's your nature I
[1:28:53] mean that your desire becomes my desire
[1:28:55] what you love I love what you hate I
[1:28:58] hate you know what you what's pleasing
[1:29:00] to you it will be pleasing to me why
[1:29:03] because his nature comes into us
[1:29:06] hallelujah amen so he says this now he
[1:29:15] sees us in masterpiece I'm just going to
[1:29:16] read a few of these that I'm going to
[1:29:17] close he says but the bride came back
[1:29:20] because she was Alpha and Omega God the
[1:29:22] great sculptor he made him a masterpiece
[1:29:25] for as a piece of his first masterpiece
[1:29:28] like he made in the Garden of Eden and
[1:29:30] it took a piece form and another piece
[1:29:32] and that was marred and fell speaking of
[1:29:35] Adam and Eve there's the masterpiece
[1:29:36] family and that's what God is restoring
[1:29:39] us to I mean but he's not just restoring
[1:29:41] us to eat him where we can fall again
[1:29:43] Amy but he's restoring us past that now
[1:29:46] we are in a place that we can never fall
[1:29:48] and I'll say this I'll just echo brother
[1:29:50] brother Donnie's words you should go
[1:29:52] listen to the service he said that if
[1:29:53] you're sealed with the Holy Ghost I mean
[1:29:56] you're already in a position that you
[1:29:58] cannot fall from holy security you're
[1:30:01] already in a better position that Adam
[1:30:02] and Eve were in hallelujah before the
[1:30:05] fall hallelujah amen
[1:30:08] we're still into the day of our
[1:30:09] Redemption I mean that's what the
[1:30:11] scripture says so we're in a better
[1:30:13] place
[1:30:14] amen yeah we can't fall from then Adam
[1:30:17] and Eve were and how lujah I'm glad were
[1:30:20] in that condition aren't you
[1:30:22] amen so so it was modern it fell but now
[1:30:28] he's but he's been all this time
[1:30:30] building it up
[1:30:30] again and he brought forth this
[1:30:32] masterpiece and it was smitten so
[1:30:35] speaking about Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:30:36] part was smitten it was in order to
[1:30:38] bring back that masterpiece again so the
[1:30:41] masterpiece and the son of God the
[1:30:43] masterpiece and the bride it's a piece
[1:30:45] of him which must be the fulfilling of
[1:30:47] the word the word has been fulfilled and
[1:30:50] we're ready for the coming of the Lord
[1:30:52] and getting the masterpiece is now we
[1:30:55] could go back on that but I believe you
[1:30:57] have the picture what I mean God's
[1:30:58] building Becker's masterpiece we are
[1:31:00] part of his masterpiece I mean if we are
[1:31:03] part of the Lord Jesus Christ we're part
[1:31:05] of his masterpiece just as Adam or Eve
[1:31:07] was part of Adam right there and them
[1:31:09] together upon the earth was God's
[1:31:11] masterpiece I mean so as Christ and his
[1:31:13] bride the masterpiece and means that God
[1:31:16] is building us this is our privilege
[1:31:18] friends this is our right we are his
[1:31:20] workmanship that the work he started he
[1:31:23] will perfect he will complete amen
[1:31:27] if we stay yielded to him so it must be
[1:31:33] fulfilling of the word the word has been
[1:31:34] fulfilled we're ready for the coming of
[1:31:36] the Lord he says now see let us not
[1:31:40] forget that in the beginning when he
[1:31:41] smoked the side of Adam he took
[1:31:42] something from a side now the smiting of
[1:31:45] Christ was for a cause that he might
[1:31:47] take from him one to be a family the
[1:31:49] bride he might take him a bride so when
[1:31:52] his masterpiece was perfected then he
[1:31:54] had to smite it to take from him not
[1:31:57] another piece not another creation but
[1:31:59] of the same creation my brother don't
[1:32:01] think bad at this but just think a
[1:32:03] minute if he took from him the original
[1:32:06] creation to make the bride for him he
[1:32:08] could never make another creation he
[1:32:10] took a part of the original creation
[1:32:12] then if he was the word what must the
[1:32:15] bride be it's got to the be the original
[1:32:17] word Living God in the word hallelujah
[1:32:24] he sees in Christ and mystery God
[1:32:26] revealed he's identified oh how the
[1:32:29] devil is howling about this the
[1:32:31] manifested truth of the promised word in
[1:32:33] her alone that's what we're identified
[1:32:35] by I mean God's vindicated word living
[1:32:39] in us that's our identification amen
[1:32:42] they don't have the answer when Jesus
[1:32:45] why didn't those Pharisees he said if I
[1:32:48] cast out Devils by the finger of God who
[1:32:50] do you cast them out by sea he stood
[1:32:52] alone and the church stands alone she's
[1:32:55] not hooked with nothing but he was
[1:32:59] identified by God being the body that
[1:33:01] God dwelt in and the church is
[1:33:03] identified by his body doing the same
[1:33:05] thing she is his body the manifested
[1:33:08] truth of us of the promised word for the
[1:33:10] last days and she and she alone stands
[1:33:12] by that's why the devil is howling these
[1:33:15] great organizations has set something up
[1:33:17] to close her up they'll never do it
[1:33:19] she'll be taken up not closed up she has
[1:33:21] now risen and by the power of the
[1:33:23] vindicated word promised to her amen now
[1:33:26] a bride holds that promise he told me he
[1:33:30] would return from me I believe it uh-huh
[1:33:32] yes sir to meet her here to meet her
[1:33:35] headship her oedema her husband her king
[1:33:38] her Lord her lover her Savior in the
[1:33:40] provided meeting place hallelujah I
[1:33:44] think we can rejoice I'm in queer the
[1:33:47] musician's place amen amen we ever right
[1:33:58] if God has made us a certain thing if we
[1:34:01] yield ourselves completely to him we
[1:34:03] can't see the difference between us and
[1:34:05] nature is nature doesn't have a free
[1:34:06] moral agency I mean it's just run by
[1:34:09] instinct like the birds and everything
[1:34:11] they don't have free moral choice but we
[1:34:13] have free moral choice and God respects
[1:34:16] that choice he doesn't make us be a
[1:34:18] Christian amen
[1:34:20] he just offers it and he says will you
[1:34:23] or won't you and it's up to you amen
[1:34:25] so if we want to be part of his great
[1:34:27] army we have to give our will over to
[1:34:30] him in order for him to have preeminence
[1:34:33] and the people our will can can no
[1:34:35] longer be our own it has to be his will
[1:34:37] in us amen
[1:34:39] the greatest victory a person can ever
[1:34:41] have us come to a place like the Lord
[1:34:43] and guess Emily not my will but thy will
[1:34:44] be done I mean where he said he
