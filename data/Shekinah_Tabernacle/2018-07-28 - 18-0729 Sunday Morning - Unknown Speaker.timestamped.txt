[24:25] luck you leave this morning so I've got
[24:26] uh I'll do an item this is a song I
[24:28] wrote about 15 years ago and it's about
[24:35] time it's a type of when the Lord was at
[24:38] Gethsemane he had to make the choice of
[24:42] whether he was going to go all the way
[24:43] with the Lord or when he was he was
[24:47] gonna go all the way to Calvary or not
[24:50] essentially whether he was going to pay
[24:52] the ultimate price he came to that point
[24:56] and it's a type in our life
[25:00] you know we get to that point where we
[25:01] have to decide am I going to go and give
[25:04] everything up for the Lord or am I going
[25:05] to what road am I going to take in this
[25:08] was a song I wrote at that time when I
[25:10] made that choice to go all the way with
[25:15] the Lord and you understand what the
[25:17] words of the song

[36:56] [Music]
[36:58] see it's here
[37:01] for ye o not come onto the mount that
[37:04] might be touched that burnt with fire
[37:08] nor unto blackness and darkness and
[37:11] tempest in the sound of a trumpet and
[37:12] the voice of words which voice they that
[37:15] heard and treated that the word should
[37:17] not be spoken to them anymore for they
[37:19] could not endure that which was
[37:21] commanded and if so much as a beast
[37:23] touch the mountain it shall be stoned or
[37:26] thrust through with a dart and so
[37:28] terrible was the sight that Moses said I
[37:30] exceedingly fear and quake but ye are
[37:33] come unto Mount Zion and unto the city
[37:36] of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem
[37:38] and to an innumerable company of angels
[37:41] to the General Assembly and Church of
[37:43] the firstborn which are written in
[37:46] heaven and to God the judge of all and
[37:48] to the spirits of just men made perfect
[37:51] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[37:54] Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling
[37:56] that speaketh better things than that of
[38:00] Abel amen let's go to Psalms chapter 50
[38:08] and we're going to read the first six
[38:11] verses of of Psalms 50 this is the
[38:18] mighty God even the Lord has spoken and
[38:22] called the Earth from the rising of the
[38:26] Sun until the going down thereof out of
[38:29] Zion out of Zion notice we're out of
[38:32] Zion the perfection of beauty God has
[38:35] shined our God shall come and shall not
[38:38] keep silence a fire shall devour before
[38:40] him and I shall be very tempura surround
[38:43] about him and he shall call to the
[38:46] heavens from above and to the earth that
[38:49] he may judge his people gather my Saints
[38:53] together unto me those that have made a
[38:56] covenant with me by sacrifice and the
[39:00] heavens shall declare his righteousness
[39:01] before God has judged himself Selah
[39:05] which means a pause Amen may the Lord
[39:07] blesses word you may have your seats
[39:10] this morning
[39:14] now I want to talk about I want to talk
[39:19] about with the help well I pray by God's
[39:21] help you know Zion this morning you know
[39:25] that where we women read about Zion or
[39:27] we read in in in in Hebrews chapter 12
[39:30] their Zion it speaks of a of a place we
[39:34] know the City of God was cool I mean the
[39:36] City of David was Zion but it also
[39:38] speaks of people it's not just a
[39:40] physical location on a map but it's
[39:42] actually a people that have been
[39:43] redeemed they've been washed in the
[39:45] blood of the Lamb and and God dwells in
[39:47] those people and God shines out his
[39:49] light from them now we read there in
[39:52] Hebrews chapter 12 where Paul as Paul is
[39:56] talking to the Hebrews he's trying to
[39:58] get them to see that what they have you
[40:01] know if you read the book of Hebrews is
[40:03] always contrasting the blood of bulls
[40:04] and goats with the blood of Jesus Christ
[40:06] he's contrasting you know the you know
[40:09] the Aaronic priesthood and the high
[40:10] priest of natural priesthood to the
[40:12] priesthood the other priesthood of Jesus
[40:14] Christ him him being our high priest
[40:16] he's saying that what we have is greater
[40:18] than what they had on the blood of bulls
[40:20] and goats it's more powerful it changes
[40:23] people
[40:24] I mean you don't have to offer a
[40:25] sacrifice year after year or you know
[40:28] but by one blood by one offering he has
[40:31] perfected them forever that he is
[40:33] sanctified so we don't have to go and
[40:35] repeat and offer a goat or a sheep or
[40:39] you know a bull you know for our sin
[40:41] offering but his blood is enough
[40:44] I mean his offering is enough hallelujah
[40:47] because under the blood of bulls and
[40:49] goats if you know whatever caused me to
[40:51] take my take my lamb you know on my
[40:54] behalf because I send you know that that
[40:57] lamb was given on my behalf and I was
[41:00] justified in the sight of God because
[41:01] God received that sacrifice but the
[41:04] thing that was within me that caused me
[41:06] to sin and bring their sacrifice it was
[41:08] still there it would not change my heart
[41:11] I still had the same nature yet being as
[41:13] sincere as relied on and waiting to
[41:15] serve God but still my nature was still
[41:18] unchanged so I would come back possibly
[41:20] the next year and the same thing I did
[41:22] the year before it would cause me to
[41:24] fall in sin again and I would offer
[41:25] another layer
[41:26] and the cycle would repeat but under the
[41:28] blood of Jesus Christ I mean we do not
[41:31] stay in that same cycle of sin and
[41:33] getting up and sitting and getting yo-yo
[41:36] it's not that cycle but God breaks that
[41:38] cycle I mean where he comes in and his
[41:40] blood changes the nature of the believer
[41:43] that the thing that once we had them in
[41:45] prison Amen would would be broken by the
[41:48] blood of Jesus Christ and they do not
[41:50] have the desire for that sin anymore
[41:53] that's what the power of the blood does
[41:55] I mean it's not just saying I believe in
[41:58] Jesus but that life that was released
[42:00] that day on Calvary comes into the
[42:02] believer and they had not been be
[42:04] sitting by sin anymore I mean we are
[42:06] free the believer is free indeed we're
[42:09] not under the bondage of sin and death
[42:11] anymore because this blood has loosed us
[42:14] yes he has set us free from that and now
[42:17] we can walk with Him hallelujah so that
[42:20] so Paul is trying to tell the Hebrews
[42:23] here that you have not come to this
[42:25] mountain Amen you have not come to Mount
[42:27] Mount Sinai where the law was given I
[42:30] mean where where they were looking you
[42:33] know the children of Israel said to
[42:35] Moses and Moses said it to God whatever
[42:37] you tell us we will do and then the law
[42:40] came the law came and they began to find
[42:43] out they could not keep this law and you
[42:45] can and that is shown by the multitudes
[42:48] of animal sacrifice that was given I
[42:50] don't know how many animals they on
[42:52] yo the amount of animal blood that was
[42:54] shed upon the earth because they could
[42:57] not keep the law amen
[42:59] but then you know but Paul is saying you
[43:02] have not come here you have not journey
[43:04] to this place you have come to a better
[43:06] place
[43:07] hallelujah he says now but you have come
[43:09] to Mount Zion and to the city of the
[43:12] Living God I mean where God dwells right
[43:15] God doesn't just dwell in heaven he
[43:17] dwells in the heart of the believer Amen
[43:20] when when the day of Pentecost was fully
[43:21] come come God came down he dwells in 120
[43:25] I mean the beginning of the New
[43:27] Testament era God came and dwelt in his
[43:29] people the Apostle Peter said that we
[43:31] are living stones lively stones built up
[43:35] into the temple of God hallelujah so
[43:38] we're not we're not
[43:39] you know we're not just a bunch of
[43:40] people gathered we were living people
[43:42] you know Jesus was taken you know he was
[43:45] walking around the temple in his day
[43:46] with the disciples and and one of the
[43:49] disciples said what what good stones are
[43:51] here look at this masonry how incredible
[43:54] this is and Jesus was saying really he
[43:57] could have see it don't know you
[43:59] shouldn't marvel at those stones
[44:00] that's just man cutting stones and
[44:03] putting it into a building it has no you
[44:06] know it's just a structure that man is
[44:08] built I mean but Jesus was gathering
[44:10] living stones when he called the
[44:13] disciples come and follow me he was
[44:15] gathering stones for his building I mean
[44:18] when he went to the woman at the well
[44:19] she was the stones for the building holy
[44:22] really Jim was the stones for the
[44:23] building Peter James and John returned
[44:25] for the building hallelujah
[44:27] USA you know Jesus could have said don't
[44:31] worry about this temple look at these
[44:33] stones I'm gathering hallelujah and it's
[44:36] the same thing today friends
[44:38] I meant that the believers in this day a
[44:40] part of the building of God I mean where
[44:42] God will take you shape you hallelujah
[44:46] like Solomon when he built the temple
[44:47] there's there's materials from different
[44:49] parts of the earth came came together in
[44:52] Jerusalem and he built thee and he built
[44:54] the temple and it's the same thing with
[44:56] us we maybe gather all different parts
[44:58] of the world it's really irrelevant
[45:00] where you come from it's where you end
[45:02] up that's the main thing I mean you may
[45:05] have been from the opposite side of the
[45:07] world but when God found you it's not
[45:10] necessarily moving to a physical
[45:11] location
[45:12] it's a spiritual location I mean where
[45:15] once dead in trespasses and sins God
[45:17] takes you because he knows where the
[45:20] stones have to go he knows how his
[45:22] building goes together hallelujah and he
[45:25] finds you and he shapes you and he mulch
[45:27] you and he places you in the body
[45:30] hallelujah
[45:32] so we've come to the city of the Living
[45:35] God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an
[45:38] innumerable company of angels
[45:40] you know jesus's ministry a large part
[45:43] of it was to open that unseen realm to
[45:45] the people here was Peter James and John
[45:48] you know then you have God and you want
[45:51] God to the Mose
[45:52] day all the headers the concept of a God
[45:54] that you know he spoke to them back
[45:56] there but where is he today and they
[45:59] well then you was fishing and you know
[46:01] some parts of the scripture was just in
[46:03] their mind and he comes he comes God and
[46:06] flesh gathers them he heals the sick
[46:09] cast out the Devils controls nature
[46:13] raises the dead
[46:14] hallelujah begins to speak about he he
[46:17] opened a spiritual realm to them to show
[46:20] them that life is more than just what
[46:22] you see or what you hear or what you
[46:24] feel what you smell it's more than just
[46:27] natural senses there's the realm that's
[46:29] far greater than we can see and God was
[46:31] wanting them to see what you see around
[46:34] you is just a small part of of creation
[46:36] but this heaven Hallowed is Angel's I
[46:40] mean is God amen there's also the devil
[46:43] and his demons amen but we have come to
[46:47] an innumerable company of angels now
[46:49] it's amazing when you know you think of
[46:52] Isaiah
[46:53] I mean sorry Alice I mean Elijah there
[46:56] is in the city of Dothan there
[46:58] the Syrians come to try and catch him
[47:00] you know and and his servant comes out
[47:03] in the morning and he gets so scared
[47:05] because he sees a Syrian army around
[47:07] around the city and he's getting worried
[47:10] probably maybe he woke up Elijah Elisha
[47:12] we're in trouble
[47:13] how are we going to escape out of the
[47:15] city the Syrians have found us what's
[47:18] going to happen and they and then Elijah
[47:21] sis don't worry it's okay it's more for
[47:24] us than against us you know and he just
[47:27] prayed Lord open my servants eyes and in
[47:30] the servant was more worried and shaken
[47:32] by the armies of heaven I'm in there
[47:35] around the Prophet amen
[47:37] Elijah's your Elijah's prayer didn't
[47:39] bring the angels of God down the army of
[47:42] heaven down and just opened the servants
[47:45] eyes that the servant would understand
[47:47] that the armies of heaven are kept
[47:49] around the prophet of God hallelujah
[47:52] and now if that is the case under the
[47:54] blood of bulls and goats now how much
[47:56] more people that have been washed in the
[47:58] blood of Jesus Christ I mean they've
[48:01] been quickened by his spirit I mean the
[48:03] bone of his bone life is why
[48:05] pleasure is flesh I mean you have a lot
[48:07] of security around you I mean yeah we
[48:11] thinking the presidents and all the you
[48:12] know all of their security around them
[48:14] that's nothing compared to you I mean
[48:16] you've got a security detail I mean I
[48:19] can't assign to you every day of your
[48:22] life and the enemy he could only touch
[48:25] you with God's permission right God
[48:28] knows what's going to happen and God
[48:30] allows it to prove his salvation
[48:33] hallelujah hey your job could stand on
[48:36] the you know all he had was offer a lamb
[48:38] and your foot it in fear
[48:41] on behalf of his family his children he
[48:44] offered a land for them least win the
[48:46] least they would send his word that they
[48:48] would send me something wrong
[48:49] who's read the book of Job he applied he
[48:52] offered the sacrifice on the Bahamas
[48:54] family out of fear and that's all he
[48:56] knew he didn't know who really God was
[48:59] or what was going to happen you're on
[49:01] the life after this he said a tree you
[49:03] know your flower it dies it comes back
[49:05] to life again tree can do the same you
[49:07] know he saw he saw nature come back to
[49:09] life after it died this is man where
[49:11] does he go he had no idea and he had no
[49:15] idea that the devil had gone and spoken
[49:17] to God and God pointed Jobe out and God
[49:20] said this is a perfect man and he's just
[49:23] living his life he's got his family in
[49:25] his business and whatever more you know
[49:27] and God points him out he's your he's
[49:33] perfect he's none like him and he
[49:36] doesn't know what's going on and his job
[49:38] and then the next day you know he whole
[49:41] bunch of servants come in to him he says
[49:43] you know you know sheep have been taken
[49:45] these animals being killed by lightning
[49:46] all these things last one that comes and
[49:49] says all of your children were in a
[49:51] house and the wind blew and it fell down
[49:53] and killed them all and there he was but
[49:57] he was standing on the lamb in you that
[49:59] God required the blood of a lamb
[50:01] hallelujah and and and he was he was
[50:05] perfect because he stood he knew that
[50:08] that's what God required and God
[50:10] accepted that sacrifice but the whole
[50:13] trial was now before the trial as I said
[50:16] he says he sees nature come back to life
[50:19] where does he go but then at the end of
[50:21] the trial he could stand and say now I
[50:23] know my redeemer lives and though the
[50:26] skin worms you know eat up this flesh
[50:28] with my eyes I'll see God and I'll stand
[50:30] with him on the last days upon the earth
[50:32] and opened the hole and opened eternity
[50:35] to him the trial openly yo the trial
[50:38] opened an unseen round to him right make
[50:40] God real to him hallelujah amen and God
[50:46] and you know as I said God wants to
[50:48] prove his salvation and in jobs day the
[50:52] blood of a lamb was salvation for them
[50:54] and God wanted to prove it in jobs life
[50:57] even though he didn't understand he
[50:59] could stand on that lamb amen now a new
[51:03] rule company of angels angels are still
[51:06] here hallelujah the Holy Ghost is
[51:09] definitely here God is present amen to
[51:13] the General Assembly and the Church of
[51:15] the firstborn amen
[51:18] God doesn't have grandchildren God has
[51:21] children that are birthed by his Spirit
[51:23] I mean which are written in heaven our
[51:26] names are written in heaven I'm just
[51:28] going to go very quickly through this
[51:29] cuz we go to the rest of our message and
[51:33] to God the judge of all and to the
[51:36] spirits of just men made perfect now
[51:38] sometimes when we think of God being a
[51:40] judge worse think of you know ways think
[51:42] of judging as in finding people guilty
[51:45] but a judge doesn't always find people
[51:47] guilty he finds people innocent right
[51:51] it's like when the woman was caught in
[51:53] adultery I think it was in John chapter
[51:54] 8 I mean in she's brought before by the
[51:57] scribes and Pharisees she's brought
[51:59] before Jesus and now now the thing is
[52:01] you know they say to him this woman was
[52:04] caught in adultery in the very act now
[52:05] the law of Moses is the man and the
[52:07] woman should be brought but they just
[52:10] pervert the word and they just bring the
[52:11] woman because they're trying to catch
[52:12] God they're trying to catch God out
[52:14] right but then this whole scene is
[52:17] actually now that and then Jesus doesn't
[52:20] say wood it begins to write in the sand
[52:22] you know they see it's he that without
[52:25] sin let him cast the first stone and
[52:27] from the oldest to the youngest they
[52:29] dropped their stones and they walk away
[52:31] convicted by their own conscience
[52:33] and then Jesus says her woman wears on
[52:36] accusers and he says there are none Lord
[52:39] she recognizes more than a man she was
[52:41] standing in the presence of right and
[52:44] and then she said he says to her neither
[52:46] do i condemn me God said no more
[52:48] so don't go back to your old life I mean
[52:51] but you've been but but he acquitted her
[52:53] she was found innocent right her judge
[52:57] his judgment actually set her free I
[53:00] mean that the accusers voice was
[53:02] silenced because the judge was standing
[53:05] there and set her free that's the same
[53:06] thing with us now when the devil comes
[53:08] to accuse you before God saying they did
[53:11] this to me this way and their this way I
[53:13] mean God looks at it says no they never
[53:15] did it in the first place my blood has
[53:17] cleansed them right I've been set free
[53:20] I'm talking about the real believer
[53:22] picture here is justice righteous by his
[53:26] own offering Alou you and to the spirits
[53:30] of just men made perfect now notice it
[53:32] does not say the bodies have just been
[53:34] made perfect but the spirits of just men
[53:36] made perfect this body has to be changed
[53:39] we know that the soul is redeemed right
[53:42] but this body it needs a body change
[53:45] right but the spirits of just men made
[53:48] perfect is that God would fully cleanser
[53:51] people right so the things that we are
[53:54] born with amen or the devil you know the
[53:57] you know the Prophet tells us it's very
[53:58] easy to actually catch an evil spirit
[54:00] without realizing it we can sympathize
[54:03] with someone and that spirit that Sodom
[54:05] can come on us and we can catch it
[54:08] without even realizing come under the
[54:10] influence of a demon power right and
[54:12] then so but God but the Apostle Paul is
[54:16] saying we have come to a place where the
[54:19] spirits of just men have been made
[54:20] perfect so there's been a full cleansing
[54:23] I mean of the spiritual part of a person
[54:27] right so all the pride is gone right all
[54:30] the lust has got all the wrath and the
[54:33] anger and the malice and the strife and
[54:35] the bitterness is gone
[54:37] hallelujah being cleansed
[54:40] hallelujah I mean we don't have to walk
[54:42] around with unforgiveness and bitterness
[54:44] and deceit having a lying spirit
[54:48] hallelujah we don't have to carry those
[54:51] things the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:52] cleanses from motion
[54:54] I mean temper problem you don't have to
[54:56] carry that round lost you don't have to
[54:58] carry that round why do we tear the
[55:00] devil's bags I'm not the devil's bag boy
[55:03] to carry the devil's bags he can carry
[55:06] his own luggage
[55:07] hallelujah isn't that right we sign for
[55:13] too much stuff we take on well I've
[55:16] always been this way and my granddad was
[55:18] this way my great granddad was this way
[55:19] that's just how I am
[55:21] where's your identity right I was born a
[55:27] glowing that's my last name
[55:29] but God but God gave me a new birth he
[55:33] changed my nature right he changed who I
[55:36] was not me trying to change myself
[55:39] you just gotta surrender you you'll be
[55:42] willing to forsake all then you can
[55:44] become his disciple you know forsake
[55:45] your old life forsake your old way
[55:48] hallelujah and then by that now he
[55:51] changed my nature that I begin to find
[55:53] out my real my natural parents are still
[55:55] my natural presence and I love them but
[55:57] my real father is God I made it if my
[56:00] real father is God I want to be like him
[56:03] hallelujah children want to be like
[56:05] their parents when they young they want
[56:07] to be just like mommy or daddy right but
[56:10] then so when you begin to when God
[56:11] reveals it to you that actually your
[56:13] father is God you ought to be like him
[56:15] and God is his word right would it be
[56:18] like his word amen so now we where where
[56:26] is your identity should be with Jesus
[56:29] Christ the word amen and to Jesus the
[56:33] mediator of the New Covenant and to the
[56:36] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[56:38] things than that of Abel this is where
[56:41] we've come now Abel's blood could not
[56:46] redeem Abel's blood can only cry out for
[56:50] you know that that he had been killed
[56:53] but his blood
[56:54] couldn't do anything right but the blood
[56:56] of Jesus Christ cleans us from all sin
[56:59] it transforms a people there's a power
[57:02] in the blood there's more than a
[57:03] religion it becomes a life it becomes a
[57:06] reality in your life I mean where you're
[57:09] no longer it's no longer either liveth
[57:11] but Christ liveth in me amen and he's
[57:15] still the mediator of the New Covenant
[57:17] now our mediators you know he's the
[57:20] go-between between both parties right so
[57:25] he is ever alive to make intercession
[57:26] for us I mean to stand in the gap on our
[57:30] behalf the scripture says that he is our
[57:33] advocate we have an advocate which is
[57:35] Jesus Christ and advocate works on your
[57:37] behalf
[57:38] amen you know we are saved by grace and
[57:41] our workers by grace and the definition
[57:44] of New Testament Grace's of the divine
[57:45] influence upon the heart and it's
[57:47] reflection and the life that's Grace
[57:49] when grace comes into your life amen
[57:52] God moves on these are divine influence
[57:53] upon your heart Lord I want to live your
[57:56] word I want to see a word manifested in
[57:58] me I mean that you'll be living
[58:01] hallelujah and there's a reflection in
[58:03] the life I mean as I've seen well you
[58:07] know while ago you can take Hebrews 11
[58:09] the chapter before this the faith
[58:11] chapter and you can call it the works
[58:12] chapter because works is what man sees
[58:15] faith is what God sees so you say by
[58:18] works Noah built the ark because that's
[58:20] what man was seeing but by faith he's
[58:22] built it because it was revealed to him
[58:24] it's kind of there's going to be a flood
[58:25] but his life was not expressing his
[58:27] faith hallelujah Abraham's life by
[58:31] leaving where he was you know going to a
[58:33] country he didn't know of dwelling there
[58:36] there that was an expression of his
[58:39] faith Moses going down to Egypt with a
[58:42] rod to deliver Israel that was that
[58:46] those works was an expression of his
[58:47] faith right so by works he delivered
[58:51] right because that's what man saw
[58:53] hallelujah Joshua amen
[58:56] him taking the land dividing it to
[58:59] Israel that was an expression of his
[59:01] faith he had to believe that he had the
[59:03] ministry to place the people in the land
[59:06] Alleluia you go through David as well I
[59:09] mean David you can see his faith was
[59:12] expressed in his life and his works he
[59:14] knew he had come to the throne at the
[59:16] right time he didn't have to kill Saul
[59:18] he had two opportunities to do so right
[59:21] but he knew God would bring him to the
[59:22] throne at the right time so his life was
[59:25] an expression of his faith and James his
[59:28] faith without works is dead you need
[59:30] both together what works is faith
[59:32] express your life should be an
[59:34] expression of what you believe and our
[59:36] life is an expression of what we believe
[59:39] amen
[59:41] now we read in Psalms 50 that out of
[59:48] Zion the perfection of beauty
[59:51] God has shined now when God looks what
[59:55] man calls Beauty and what God calls be
[59:57] there's two different things you see the
[1:00:00] Tabernacle in the wilderness I'll show
[1:00:02] the picture of the replica it's just a
[1:00:04] tent I say we we say well that's just a
[1:00:08] tip man would say that's just a tent
[1:00:09] God would say that's beautiful amen
[1:00:13] Israel dwelling in its homeland living
[1:00:16] as you're living with God God in the
[1:00:19] midst would say well that's just a bunch
[1:00:20] of people you know there's nothing too
[1:00:22] special God say that's beauty God has
[1:00:25] always failed in every generation he has
[1:00:29] failed and he speaks through a veil and
[1:00:33] Moses day Moses was the veil right here
[1:00:37] was an 80 year old man with a staff his
[1:00:40] wife she's with the two boys going you
[1:00:44] know a back of a mule whatever they're
[1:00:46] on they went down into Egypt and it you
[1:00:49] know you know just the casual
[1:00:50] observation say well that's just an old
[1:00:52] man with his wife and two boys now here
[1:00:55] was God now God had taken someone God
[1:00:58] was veiled God was going to speak God
[1:01:01] was going to do here is veiled and and
[1:01:04] there's always the problem sometimes we
[1:01:08] forget well sometimes people do not
[1:01:11] understand God is always hidden and he
[1:01:16] reveals himself you're the hardest thing
[1:01:18] to do is for immortal
[1:01:19] to get another mortal to believe them I
[1:01:23] mean it's always been a battle to get a
[1:01:25] mortal to believe another mortal you can
[1:01:28] say well you're just you and this is
[1:01:29] what you think no but you know sometimes
[1:01:33] it's more than that and we find out here
[1:01:39] that God has always been had skin on him
[1:01:41] when Moses seen him he had skin on him
[1:01:44] look like a man when God was behind the
[1:01:46] curtains he had skin on him and gods
[1:01:48] night and his churches veiled in his
[1:01:50] church with skin on it he is still the
[1:01:52] same God tonight we find that but now as
[1:01:55] ever the skin veils what catches the
[1:01:57] traditions you just can't believe that
[1:02:00] that God is making them people act like
[1:02:02] that see it's because God has veiled in
[1:02:04] his church and skin skin on it that's
[1:02:06] right he has had from the unbeliever and
[1:02:08] reveal to the believer yes sir God was
[1:02:12] veiled in Jesus Christ
[1:02:13] I mean God was veiled in his church you
[1:02:17] read Acts chapter 9 Paul's on the road
[1:02:19] to Damascus God comes to him light
[1:02:23] shines upon him he says who are you Lord
[1:02:25] that word a lot of Supreme one who are
[1:02:27] you he says I'm Jesus whom you persecute
[1:02:30] now Paul wasn't chasing after a
[1:02:32] supernatural light he was looking for
[1:02:35] Christians and he wanted to put them in
[1:02:37] prison that's what he is doing but God
[1:02:39] was saying now you're persecuting me
[1:02:41] because I'm veiled in those people amen
[1:02:47] it's a God as always veiled and God
[1:02:49] should be veiled today I mean if you
[1:02:52] really know the Lord Jesus Christ he'll
[1:02:54] be in you his Holy Spirit will be in you
[1:02:56] know when just be with you
[1:02:58] he died on Calvary that he was dwelling
[1:03:00] man he'd reveal himself through man this
[1:03:03] that's what he's always wanted now let's
[1:03:07] go to Isaiah 12
[1:03:08] [Music]

[1:04:56] need to you know if there's anything you
[1:04:58] have need of draw it out with joy what

[1:05:16] strength the joy the Lord is our
[1:05:18] strength
[1:05:19] hallelujah you say well now we read
[1:05:24] they're the spirits of just men made
[1:05:26] perfect
[1:05:27] that's the believers condition in this
[1:05:29] day now many people you may think well
[1:05:33] how can I be that way well the season
[1:05:37] seeing Corinthians 5:21 he that hath
[1:05:40] made for he hath made him to be sin for
[1:05:42] us speaking of Jesus who knew no sin now
[1:05:45] it's very easy to say that he was made
[1:05:47] sin here's our sin offering Amen that we
[1:05:50] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:05:53] of God in him you ought to you ought to
[1:05:56] believe both parts of the scripture he
[1:05:58] was made sin for me that I'd become 8 be
[1:06:02] be made his righteousness amen so if he
[1:06:07] was made sin who believed he was made
[1:06:09] sin for me
[1:06:09] sin for you he took your son up to
[1:06:12] Calvary he was your sin offering he went
[1:06:15] to hell on your behalf
[1:06:17] there you don't need to go there Amen he
[1:06:19] he died a sinner in your place that is a
[1:06:22] righteous one you'd go to heaven however
[1:06:24] he took your place that day you don't
[1:06:27] need to go to hell Jesus already gone
[1:06:29] here he went he took your son down there
[1:06:32] that you don't need to take your own son
[1:06:34] down there and be stand and be stuck
[1:06:36] there hallelujah what an exchange isn't
[1:06:39] it wonderful I mean that we might be
[1:06:42] made the righteousness of God in him so
[1:06:44] therefore the real believer is as
[1:06:46] righteous as God is righteous Amen is as
[1:06:49] holy as God as holy as this pure as God
[1:06:51] as pure
[1:06:52] is that too strong I don't think that's
[1:06:55] too strong you know if if he took my
[1:06:58] place that I'll be made in His image and
[1:07:01] if he was holy and pure and righteous
[1:07:04] without spot he said I'm going to have a
[1:07:06] bride have a church without spot or
[1:07:08] wrinkle or any such thing and it's his
[1:07:11] doing it's his blood amen and then when
[1:07:14] that comes and when the life that was
[1:07:16] released at down Calvary comes unto you
[1:07:18] you'll live that life too sure what you
[1:07:21] are amen it's his doing aren't you glad
[1:07:25] he told his doing and you're glad I told
[1:07:27] him you just yield yourself and I'll
[1:07:30] just say well he's gonna do it it's like
[1:07:32] love doing hallelujah and your faith
[1:07:34] draws you in pay him in and then he
[1:07:37] takes you and changes your nature amen
[1:07:41] glory to God I'm glad I'm glad faith
[1:07:45] brings the promise down right faith
[1:07:47] doesn't push the promise away faith
[1:07:49] brings the promise to you I miss just
[1:07:51] like Abraham the same faith that he
[1:07:54] believed God to leave his land and gun
[1:07:56] to the promised land
[1:07:57] that same faith poured Isaac I mean to
[1:08:00] the same faith Lord forgive me
[1:08:02] same face should be Lord fill me fill me
[1:08:04] with your spirit brings the Holy Ghost
[1:08:06] down hallelujah amen
[1:08:10] it doesn't push faith speakers on this
[1:08:13] wise the word is nigh thee even in thy
[1:08:17] mouth right doesn't say doesn't say you
[1:08:20] know who will cool them down from above
[1:08:22] or you know up from below no it says
[1:08:24] faith speaketh on this wise the word is
[1:08:27] nigh thee even in thy mouth even in my
[1:08:29] heart the word which we preach so he's
[1:08:31] saying that the works he's saying and
[1:08:32] Jesus's word right so he say he's not
[1:08:35] distant faith doesn't say he's distant
[1:08:37] faces he's present I mean that the
[1:08:40] promise is present Alleluia now with joy
[1:08:47] shall you draw out the water of the
[1:08:50] wells of salvation that Jesus said this
[1:08:54] he says jesus answered to seed unto her
[1:08:55] the woman at the well if thou knewest
[1:08:57] the gift of God and who it is that saith
[1:09:00] to thee give me to drink thou wouldest
[1:09:03] have asked of him and he would have
[1:09:05] given thee living water
[1:09:06] the woman said I'm saith unto her Sir
[1:09:09] thou has nothing to draw with and the
[1:09:12] well is deep from whence then hast thou
[1:09:15] that living water now let's just read
[1:09:21] this he says in John 7 and the last days
[1:09:24] of that great feast Jesus stood up and
[1:09:26] cried saying if any man thirst let him
[1:09:29] come unto me and drink he that believeth
[1:09:31] on me as the scripture saith out of his
[1:09:33] belly shall flow rivers of living living
[1:09:36] water
[1:09:36] but he spake but he this spake he of a
[1:09:39] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:09:42] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[1:09:44] not yet given because Jesus was not yet
[1:09:47] glorified so he sang to the woman at the
[1:09:50] well you need to drink of this water you
[1:09:53] need a drink of this water and if you
[1:09:55] drink of this water you'll never thirst
[1:09:56] again but then he also says now if you
[1:09:59] have this water it will flow out of you
[1:10:02] out of your belly will flow
[1:10:04] of living water speaking of the Spirit
[1:10:06] of God so the people that really know
[1:10:08] their God
[1:10:08] there'll be an outlet right it just
[1:10:10] won't be going in and then and end them
[1:10:12] I mean gonna be flowing out and out and
[1:10:14] out kaalia flying a river of living
[1:10:17] water it's not a trickle it's a gusher
[1:10:20] hell yeah a river is a lot of water
[1:10:22] moving hallelujah so you say now the
[1:10:25] Spirit of God will come unto them and
[1:10:27] will flow out hallelujah and that's the
[1:10:30] glory that shines out of Zion right as
[1:10:34] the Spirit of God shining forth I mean
[1:10:36] that when you come in contact with
[1:10:38] believers I mean sometimes you go away
[1:10:40] you feel so refreshed hallelujah because
[1:10:43] you cover the presence of God doesn't
[1:10:45] matter how they may be feeling
[1:10:47] necessarily you say I feel so refreshed
[1:10:49] I feel so much better cuz of that
[1:10:51] fellowship I did why is that because
[1:10:53] you've been in the prints of living
[1:10:54] water has been flowing through them from
[1:10:56] one part of the body to the other
[1:10:59] hallelujah
[1:11:00] isn't that right hey man it's not just
[1:11:03] what God pulls in and it stays there it
[1:11:05] pours out hallelujah you see that over
[1:11:08] the day of Pentecost he comes the great
[1:11:10] source of the great gusher it comes into
[1:11:13] the room like the sound of rushing
[1:11:14] mighty wind fills each one I mean they
[1:11:17] didn't just say this same wasn't that a
[1:11:19] wonderful experience they burst out of
[1:11:21] that place holy they begin to dance and
[1:11:24] shout and act like a bunch of drunk
[1:11:26] people under the intoxication of the
[1:11:28] Spirit now they could live with everyday
[1:11:30] life hallelujah we're gonna get drunk on
[1:11:32] some bunch of alcohol there's a spurt
[1:11:34] we're gonna be drunk on which is a
[1:11:36] spirit of God hallelujah and they didn't
[1:11:39] stay there they burst out of that place
[1:11:41] because the life has to spread right
[1:11:44] life has to spread love just straight I
[1:11:46] mean you see you know like here we have
[1:11:49] the roar up in Canada there's the rut
[1:11:51] with the moose and stuff you know those
[1:11:53] moose will take on trains they'll take
[1:11:57] on a train he comes a freight train
[1:11:59] they're on the tracks something's in
[1:12:00] them this is a threat
[1:12:02] something something life must come forth
[1:12:04] and they'll take on anything
[1:12:07] hallelujah because life must come
[1:12:09] hallelujah and how much more than
[1:12:11] believer and we're more than just animal
[1:12:14] life I mean we're redeemed
[1:12:16] and daughters of God but they should be
[1:12:18] something in you life must be expression
[1:12:20] life must come for hallelujah let's must
[1:12:23] go for a me that's how it should be you
[1:12:27] can't hide it under a bushel I'm gonna
[1:12:30] let it shine
[1:12:32] hallelujah Amen that's how it should be
[1:12:36] why because out of the believer comes
[1:12:37] this river of living water amen and you
[1:12:41] can't stop it flowing there's something
[1:12:44] bubbling so our program tells the story
[1:12:46] when he's hunting he comes to the stream
[1:12:48] and it's bubbling he says you know if
[1:12:50] the stream could talk you have a
[1:12:52] conversation what makes you bubble
[1:12:53] stream that's because the deer come mr.
[1:12:56] deer comes and drinks from you seeis no
[1:12:57] because mr. beer or whoever else comes
[1:12:59] into Encino he says well why do you
[1:13:01] bubble because it's something pushing
[1:13:03] from the inside which is pushing the
[1:13:05] water up
[1:13:06] hallelujah should be the same thing with
[1:13:08] the believer there's something in me
[1:13:10] that's pushing this out I can't stop it
[1:13:12] it must come forth hallelujah and how I
[1:13:15] live and how I speak and hard treat one
[1:13:17] another there's a life coming lujah I'm
[1:13:23] so glad it bubbles so you believe it
[1:13:25] it's bubbling it's bubbling deep with
[1:13:27] them we're singing you're laughing or
[1:13:29] whatever it goes you know the song some
[1:13:31] folks don't understand it
[1:13:33] what's wrong with these people but I
[1:13:34] can't keep it quiet it's bubbling
[1:13:37] bubbling bubbling day and night
[1:13:39] hallelujah there's nothing wrong with
[1:13:42] being excited well you should be excited
[1:13:45] Amy what's wrong with this is glorious
[1:13:48] what do you mean I'm going to heaven
[1:13:50] I've got any title life I mean I've got
[1:13:53] overcoming power of the devil
[1:13:55] I got peace with God what what is there
[1:13:58] not to be excited about you know all all
[1:14:02] this in heaven - what do you mean we
[1:14:04] just get it all here you get it all can
[1:14:06] you really have it all yeah
[1:14:07] but it depends what you're talking about
[1:14:09] I mean with God you can't have it all
[1:14:11] you can't have your cake and eat it too
[1:14:14] Oh glory to God I'm so glad that's the
[1:14:20] way amen but now as I said about we've
[1:14:25] come to a you know come to a company of
[1:14:29] a
[1:14:30] your company of angels we have to look
[1:14:33] how god we have to what we speak about
[1:14:35] ourselves should be what God says about
[1:14:38] us must be that way our testimony and
[1:14:42] God's testimony to be the same right we
[1:14:45] can't speak contrary to what God says
[1:14:47] about us I mean and our lives should
[1:14:50] speak what God says about us even more
[1:14:53] hallelujah
[1:14:54] just like brother Graham tells the story
[1:14:56] of that slave there's witness you know
[1:14:58] slavery and you know in America slave
[1:15:01] owner goes to a plantation looking to
[1:15:03] buy slaves and he say and it's
[1:15:05] re-examines all the slaves he sees this
[1:15:07] one and he goes to the plantation owner
[1:15:09] what's different with this one does he
[1:15:12] eat different no eats the same does he
[1:15:14] sleep in different places the other
[1:15:16] slaves no he he he sleeps in the same
[1:15:18] bunkhouse or whatever does he do any
[1:15:21] different kind of work no he does the
[1:15:22] same work what makes him different and
[1:15:24] the plantation owner says I was
[1:15:25] wondering that myself because the slave
[1:15:27] was acting very different to the others
[1:15:28] he worked hard I mean but you know he
[1:15:31] was different
[1:15:31] conducted himself a different kind of
[1:15:33] way and then so the plantation owner
[1:15:35] Tulsa tells the slave boy I was
[1:15:37] wondering this myself I come to find out
[1:15:39] that he's a King son and his father is a
[1:15:42] king of a tribe in Africa and though he
[1:15:45] may never go on and and and take over
[1:15:48] his father's Kingdom he knows he's a son
[1:15:50] of a king so he he conducts himself as a
[1:15:53] king son hallelujah should be the same
[1:15:57] thing we're in the same world as
[1:15:58] everyone else we're not in a bubble
[1:16:00] weren't in some commune and some up in
[1:16:02] the mountains in there where we eat the
[1:16:05] same kind of food we have the same kind
[1:16:07] of trials we're the same kind of
[1:16:09] hardship right but yet there should be
[1:16:12] something in us that we conduct
[1:16:13] ourselves differently I mean because
[1:16:16] we're kings children amen we're Kings
[1:16:19] children
[1:16:20] Alleluia I trust that you know that he
[1:16:24] means we should conduct yourself because
[1:16:26] I'm a son of the king hallelujah amen so
[1:16:32] his his testimony was the same as his
[1:16:34] father's testimony back in Africa
[1:16:36] that's my son that was taken he's a king
[1:16:39] son and he's here in America saying I'm
[1:16:41] a king son
[1:16:42] and he loved according to who he was
[1:16:45] so our testimony and God's testimony
[1:16:48] vows needs to be the same this is
[1:16:52] speaking here in Isaiah 49 it says they
[1:16:55] shall not hunger nor thirst neither
[1:16:57] shall the heat nor Sun smite them for he
[1:17:01] that hath mercy on them shall lead them
[1:17:03] even by the Springs of water shall he
[1:17:07] guide them and I will make all I will
[1:17:12] make all my mountains away my highway
[1:17:14] shall be exalted behold these shall come
[1:17:17] from the far and low from the north and
[1:17:20] from the west and these are the land of
[1:17:22] of cinema and then he says here sing o
[1:17:27] heavens we have that up there sing sorry
[1:17:34] let's go back a bit
[1:17:35] technology isaiah 40:8 sorry 49 8 & 9
[1:17:39] we'll start from there they'll say the
[1:17:41] Lord an acceptable time have I heard
[1:17:42] thee and in a day of salvation have I
[1:17:45] helped thee and I'll preserve thee and
[1:17:47] give thee for a covenant of other people
[1:17:50] to establish youth to caused to inherit
[1:17:52] the desolate Heritage's that thou may
[1:17:55] say to the prisoners go forth to them
[1:17:58] that are in darkness show yourselves
[1:18:00] they shall feed in the waist and their
[1:18:02] pastures shall be in all high places
[1:18:04] they shall not hunger nor thirst neither
[1:18:07] shall the heat nor Sun smite them for he
[1:18:10] that hath mercy on them shall lead them
[1:18:12] even by the Springs of water shall he
[1:18:14] guide them and I will make all my
[1:18:16] mountains away and my highway shall be
[1:18:19] exalted behold these shall come from far
[1:18:23] and low these from the north and from
[1:18:24] the west and these from the land of of
[1:18:26] sinem singer heavens and be joyful on
[1:18:31] earth break forth into singing o
[1:18:33] mountains for the LORD hath comforted us
[1:18:35] people and will have mercy upon his
[1:18:37] afflicted I mean say sang sing be glad
[1:18:41] shout rejoice a man for the Lord has
[1:18:45] comforted his people Amen and he will
[1:18:47] have mercy upon his afflicted has he had
[1:18:49] mercy upon you amen has he comforted you
[1:18:53] hallelujah but Zion seed now notice now
[1:18:59] no it doesn't say science IDO I will
[1:19:02] sing our heavens and be joyful and and
[1:19:05] and I'll break for them to singing for
[1:19:07] the Lord has comforted me and he has had
[1:19:09] mercy upon me that was afflicted it
[1:19:11] doesn't say that it sees bazan said the
[1:19:14] Lord has forsaken me my Lord has
[1:19:17] forgotten me this is her testimony see
[1:19:21] this is sometimes we feel this way the
[1:19:24] Lord's forgotten me it's like I'm
[1:19:26] praying to a wall you know sometimes God
[1:19:28] will allow these things to happen
[1:19:29] sometimes they feel like I'm just not
[1:19:31] getting anywhere God wants to see what
[1:19:34] you're gonna do when your revival maybe
[1:19:36] is taken away are you going to stand
[1:19:39] upon the word and keep plowing through
[1:19:41] well you say well I don't feel it so I
[1:19:43] won't do it right we should do it
[1:19:46] because we believe it not because we
[1:19:47] just feel it I mean because when it's
[1:19:50] all taken away what are you gonna stand
[1:19:52] on your feelings
[1:19:53] one day you're feeling like Lord of I'm
[1:19:56] ready for the rapture now Here I am
[1:19:59] the next day Oh Lord am I ever going to
[1:20:02] make it it's feelings
[1:20:04] that's feelings don't go by feelings got
[1:20:06] my faith what do you believe in what
[1:20:09] does that get in your soul has this wood
[1:20:11] anchored in your soul stay on that stay
[1:20:14] on that word halle-loo cuz the devil
[1:20:17] will beat you around the devil knows how
[1:20:19] we built
[1:20:20] he studied us for thousands of years he
[1:20:22] knows how man works amen he's very good
[1:20:26] at working against us because he knows
[1:20:29] how men is built so we can't fall into
[1:20:32] his traps of walking by feeling we are
[1:20:36] full of joy unspeakable full of glory
[1:20:38] both Graham says that the church doesn't
[1:20:40] understand you know you know those it's
[1:20:42] not revealed to that he doesn't
[1:20:43] understand they don't understand the
[1:20:45] extreme joy that the church enjoys right
[1:20:47] now so there's times of joy but I'm
[1:20:50] saying when that's taken away what are
[1:20:51] you standing on amen do we have joy oh
[1:20:57] yeah now the Lord has forsaken me my
[1:21:01] child
[1:21:01] I mean time my my Lord has forgotten me
[1:21:05] can a woman forget her suckling child
[1:21:07] that she should not have compassion on
[1:21:09] the son of a worm
[1:21:10] yeah they may forget that's incredible
[1:21:13] well of course I've never given birth
[1:21:15] cuz I'm not a woman but I think you'd
[1:21:17] remember that you do remember having a
[1:21:20] child right you would remember that it
[1:21:24] wouldn't be a day that you are when did
[1:21:26] that happen but God says a woman can
[1:21:28] even forget having a child but he says
[1:21:33] now yeah they may forget see but will I
[1:21:37] not forget thee behold I have graven the
[1:21:42] upon the palms of my hands
[1:21:44] the walls are continually before me oh
[1:21:47] there's a god yeah we have to start
[1:21:50] testifying how God's is about us if he
[1:21:52] says I'm sinless some sunless the feces
[1:21:55] I've been made a saint by his blood I'm
[1:21:57] a saint right just like brother Albert
[1:22:00] Christine's dad's testimony when when
[1:22:02] God is dealing with him any and he's in
[1:22:04] Switzerland he's at a church service you
[1:22:06] know and it any talks to the evangelists
[1:22:08] and you know they're talking about
[1:22:10] things and and then there's a scripture
[1:22:13] that I think the Evangelist reads about
[1:22:14] being a saint being sanctified and the
[1:22:17] Avenger sister we'll have you ever
[1:22:18] thanked him for it he doesn't feel like
[1:22:20] a saint at that time and he says
[1:22:23] whatever you think them and they pray
[1:22:25] they thank him and then brother Albert's
[1:22:27] driving driving in his car for the
[1:22:29] meeting God comes down and he's got to
[1:22:32] pull the car because he's shouting and
[1:22:34] rejoicing because what he read he
[1:22:37] thanked him out of a heart of faith and
[1:22:39] believeth not trying not trying but it
[1:22:42] was that he actually believed it that
[1:22:44] God could make him a saint and God made
[1:22:46] him a saint right so his faith made the
[1:22:49] promise come alive to him amen and
[1:22:53] that's why we should thank him we should
[1:22:55] be thankful hallelujah amen now out of
[1:23:05] Zion he has shined and God calls her the
[1:23:09] perfection of beauty you take a people
[1:23:12] now God and nature nature is run just by
[1:23:16] instinct and it's out you know birds
[1:23:19] have to migrate or something zone they
[1:23:20] to move or eels or salmon or whatever
[1:23:23] great your migrations but it's built in
[1:23:26] them it's hardwired angels were made to
[1:23:28] worship God you know they were just
[1:23:30] built to worship right but man now is on
[1:23:34] a free moral agency and so the believer
[1:23:37] now out of their own heart and choice
[1:23:42] when God offers eternal life to them
[1:23:45] they say yes will you forsake all and
[1:23:48] follow me yes right will you live for me
[1:23:51] something in them just says yes right so
[1:23:54] now here's a people you know the devil
[1:23:56] doesn't think too much of humanity look
[1:23:59] at how he's made the world it's just you
[1:24:03] know he doesn't care and this world is
[1:24:05] trying to tell us that we are not
[1:24:07] important right we just a number we're
[1:24:09] just a bunch of genes it doesn't matter
[1:24:11] we are not important that's what the
[1:24:13] devil's trying to tell us right but God
[1:24:16] doesn't want us to think that way we are
[1:24:18] important to God we are special to God
[1:24:20] right and he takes a people that were
[1:24:23] born and sin shaped at iniquity come to
[1:24:26] the world speaking lies he takes them
[1:24:28] takes them out of the muck and mire of
[1:24:30] the world cleanses us God does a full
[1:24:33] cleansing
[1:24:34] I mean God does a full washing
[1:24:36] hallelujah God does a transformation and
[1:24:39] then he takes us and said such as jewels
[1:24:41] and his crown amen
[1:24:44] and normally when you see a king of
[1:24:46] something with a big crown and all this
[1:24:48] what we'd call bling you don't really
[1:24:50] look at the person you look at the
[1:24:51] jewels you say man that that King must
[1:24:54] be pretty loaded look at the big
[1:24:55] crannies God on his head right your
[1:24:58] chechen is drawn to the jewel but the
[1:25:01] jewel was cut it was set by a skilled
[1:25:05] craftsman I mean to reflect something
[1:25:07] and God takes you we can be a dot who
[1:25:12] who's never seen a diamond when it's
[1:25:14] just cut out of the ground it doesn't
[1:25:16] look like a diamond but that you may see
[1:25:18] in some jewelry it just looks like a
[1:25:20] piece of rock nothing too special that's
[1:25:22] like us we're just laying in the earth
[1:25:25] whatever you know wherever we're hewed
[1:25:28] from I mean God takes us but in his
[1:25:31] heart he's like this is the perfection
[1:25:33] of beauty
[1:25:33] in this jewel is my perfection of beauty
[1:25:37] and he takes us and he cuts his password
[1:25:40] he holds us up to the light cat sister
[1:25:43] but Maul polishes us now his lot can
[1:25:46] shine through hallelujah and then we
[1:25:50] said in his crown hallelujah and God
[1:25:54] says she is the perfection of beauty
[1:25:56] doesn't matter what the world says about
[1:25:58] beauty what does God say are people that
[1:26:00] are yielded to him I mean that are in
[1:26:03] their possession praising praising him
[1:26:05] out of a willing heart loving for him
[1:26:08] out of a willing heart letting him come
[1:26:10] and reflect himself through them holy
[1:26:13] and the beauty of holiness
[1:26:14] now that's Beauty to God amen now God
[1:26:24] said so Jesus so Adam and Eve Adam was
[1:26:28] called the first Adam right but then he
[1:26:32] calls Jesus the last Adam in the New
[1:26:34] Testament so now but there was the first
[1:26:37] Eve now there has to be a last Eve which
[1:26:39] is the church from Calvary - now there
[1:26:42] has to be a ransom group of people not
[1:26:44] just one woman but a whole body of
[1:26:46] people were just symbolized in that one
[1:26:48] woman right so there has to be now
[1:26:51] now brother Branham says when when we
[1:26:53] when God made the earth and everything
[1:26:55] and he and he made Eden and he put man
[1:26:57] in Eden you know and then he took out of
[1:27:00] Adam the woman he said that's Dells
[1:27:03] God's masterpiece family after he made
[1:27:06] that then he rested but then he said the
[1:27:09] devil Kaman was sin any and he broke it
[1:27:12] I think God has been rebuilding and
[1:27:15] through the Old Testament God was
[1:27:17] rebuilding the man because when Jesus
[1:27:19] his disciples came to him and Jesus
[1:27:22] asked him who do men say that I am they
[1:27:24] say some say you're Elijah Jeremias or
[1:27:26] one of the prophets it's because what
[1:27:28] they read about of you know you know
[1:27:30] Elias or Jeremiah where the prophets
[1:27:31] doing they could see in jesus's life so
[1:27:34] God through the prophets was rebuilding
[1:27:36] the man then finally all that was in the
[1:27:39] prophets the fall as the Godhead bodily
[1:27:40] was now in one man Christ Jesus there
[1:27:42] was the man restored right but now this
[1:27:45] where's the woman
[1:27:47] there's going to be a restoration of
[1:27:49] Eden dance to be and and and Jesus
[1:27:51] called the last Adam there has to be a
[1:27:53] last thief right so from Calvary down to
[1:27:56] now God has been building the woman
[1:27:59] hallelujah and so we'll see what does
[1:28:04] this got to do with the perfection of
[1:28:06] beauty being Zion
[1:28:07] now when God builds a masterpiece he
[1:28:09] builds a masterpiece
[1:28:11] he is the best artist he is the best
[1:28:14] sculptor maker he knows what he's doing
[1:28:17] so he took so he showed what a man
[1:28:20] should be in Jesus Christ he showed his
[1:28:23] character and a man doesn't and Jesus
[1:28:25] was a masterpiece don't you think he
[1:28:27] remains spake like this man there were
[1:28:29] men did things like this man did there
[1:28:31] are men treated people like how how he
[1:28:33] treated people how compassion was led by
[1:28:36] the Spirit of God wasn't oneness with
[1:28:38] the you know with God his father the
[1:28:40] spirit in him did the works and men he
[1:28:43] says I always do that which pleases my
[1:28:44] father hallelujah that's just the man
[1:28:47] now what about the woman Jesus died that
[1:28:51] now the last Eve would be formed from
[1:28:54] Calvary down to now and so if God is
[1:28:58] saying that Zion is the perfection of
[1:29:00] beauty see how do you look at yourself
[1:29:03] now I don't think it's proud to say that
[1:29:05] I'm gonna you know you know that I am
[1:29:08] sinless I'm virtuous I'm as holy as God
[1:29:11] as holy I'm part of his bride to me
[1:29:14] there's not being proud because if he's
[1:29:16] made me a certain way you know if you're
[1:29:20] made a certain way and he reveals it to
[1:29:24] you you're not proud about it for one
[1:29:26] right you're not arrogant the scribes
[1:29:28] and Pharisees they you know they
[1:29:31] received the same word that Moses
[1:29:32] received Moses received the law in Mount
[1:29:35] Sinai by revelation describes the
[1:29:37] Pharisee received it just by learning
[1:29:39] Moses was the meekest man in all the
[1:29:41] earth and God revealing himself to Moses
[1:29:44] made him that way
[1:29:45] right but the scribes Pharisees they
[1:29:47] just learned it they they became proud
[1:29:48] arrogant people and so now if it's a
[1:29:51] revelation to you this is what God has
[1:29:53] made you you don't become proud you
[1:29:55] become humble and yielded and thankful
[1:29:58] right but if he's made me thus then
[1:30:01] shouldn't I say this is what I am is it
[1:30:04] wrong to say like if David it's been
[1:30:06] anointed to be king of Israel would it
[1:30:08] wrong to be for him to say one day I'm
[1:30:10] going to be king
[1:30:11] God's made me king now I'm King right
[1:30:14] but the devil doesn't want you to
[1:30:16] believe in what God has made you to be
[1:30:19] he doesn't he doesn't want you to live
[1:30:21] according to your privilege he wants you
[1:30:24] to live under your privilege
[1:30:25] but let's but I believe we should live
[1:30:28] according to our privilege I mean let's
[1:30:30] not live below our privileges let's live
[1:30:32] according to our privileges in Christ
[1:30:33] Jesus amen let's have let's have the
[1:30:37] musicians let's just wind it up there
[1:30:41] but if God says the church is the
[1:30:43] perfection of beauty I say yay Lord and
[1:30:47] he is shined out of her hallelujah I say
[1:30:50] Lord shine forth your glory and the
[1:30:54] world may not understand it but they've
[1:30:59] never understood it I mean I trust you
[1:31:04] love them this morning
[1:31:07] let's just wait sorry can we just have
[1:31:09] one more we have that again let's read
[1:31:14] this last I move then we'll finish there
[1:31:21] won't be electronics in heaven I can

[1:31:45] masterpiece of the family the husband
[1:31:47] and wife cannot be truly family unless
[1:31:50] they are one they have to be if they're
[1:31:53] not they're not a good family wife
[1:31:54] pulling one of my husband the other
