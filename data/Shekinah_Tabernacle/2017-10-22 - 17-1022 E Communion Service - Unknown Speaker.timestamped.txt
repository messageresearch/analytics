[0:00] great thing the problem with it is is
[0:05] that people create one little great
[0:07] thing but that one little great thing
[0:09] that's got to work with all the other
[0:10] great things that have been invented and
[0:12] say with technologies like that people
[0:15] create small components and you get
[0:16] another component that's got to work
[0:17] with that and then if you've got three
[0:19] that's gotta live with it and that and
[0:20] then that net-net and it's all got to
[0:21] work together but it never does it's
[0:23] always like this one doesn't like that
[0:24] one if this one has a little sitting it
[0:26] messes with that one it's all it's kind
[0:28] of like an unconverted people you know
[0:32] they're always just he's all fusses and
[0:33] arguing and complaining but you see
[0:35] God's creation he made this one with
[0:37] that one in mind and with that one of
[0:39] mine with that one and that one and that
[0:41] one has his creation of the the universe
[0:44] it all works together perfectly he made
[0:47] the whole lot but let's see if one
[0:48] person made the whole all the technology
[0:50] and decided that's how they wanted to do
[0:52] it it would be fun but it's not because
[0:54] that's the way men is we just find out
[0:55] beings we're not we're clever but we're
[0:57] not it's clever as God and yeah but that
[1:03] would be good when we don't need all the
[1:04] technology stuff it's not yeah it's a
[1:06] good aid but it's a means to an end let
[1:10] some stand this morning and thank the
[1:13] Lord for being here and just coming out
[1:15] on to him Heavenly Father were so
[1:19] grateful Lord that we can just be a part
[1:22] of the wonderful creation that you've
[1:24] made Lord is David often pondered it
[1:27] Lord and he looked out at the universe
[1:29] and all the things Lord the works of
[1:32] your hands and he started to think lord
[1:35] of how that you know his thoughts are
[1:37] far off Lord that you just know all
[1:40] things and Lord he got to the point
[1:42] where he said such knowledge is just too

[11:19] Adam Anders got a special on but he as
[11:23] he comes up brother Albert you know what
[11:25] dad is on Tuesday
[11:27] let's choose there you very smart so so
[11:37] that was 15 years ago and to say that
[11:38] brother Albert married Shannon and I on
[11:40] the beach and finally my tart wasn't it
[11:43] yeah at that time that really spoke to
[11:51] me because we didn't know how but well
[11:54] well as a maybe being younger when I was
[11:57] a young fellow he would spend time with
[12:00] my father I knew him but just as a you
[12:02] know when you get older you meet people
[12:03] and you get to know them a wee bit more
[12:04] but it was just really touching the
[12:06] effort that brother Albert made to marry
[12:10] us and drive up and I know they had a
[12:12] little children then and twins and all
[12:13] these things and they him in sister Brom
[12:16] and they made a big effort to to marry
[12:18] us and give it all together and it's
[12:20] always touched my heart even still to
[12:23] this day and I feel a bit like um was it
[12:31] David who was the man that said who is
[12:34] there any of souls he wants to do good
[12:35] to somebody who was it that yeah because
[12:38] of something that yeah David there
[12:40] because of odd Jonathan because of what
[12:42] Jonathan he said is in any of his
[12:43] relations so alive I want to do want to
[12:45] bless him and and I feel privileged to
[12:48] be able to serve brother being assist
[12:49] Christine here you know because I think
[12:51] you know brother Albert did a lot for me
[12:53] in that time when I needed it and it's
[12:54] not that that's all I'll enjoy coming
[12:56] here too but it's always something
[12:57] that's been on my heart so thank you and
[12:59] God bless you
[13:08] I'll just first explain myself before I
[13:10] sing this song everybody since I made
[13:16] the Lord I used to play guitar try to
[13:19] play guitar just because I wanted to
[13:21] know and to please people and then I
[13:24] made the Lord and now I wanted to sing
[13:26] songs for him but my songs never sound
[13:28] like Isaac's are always so different so
[13:31] so be with me when I sing this song my
[13:33] way because that's just that's how I
[13:36] feel when I sing it so when I play it I
[13:37] just sing in my way so if it doesn't
[13:39] sound like the original just sing with
[13:41] me I just want to give it standard
[13:46] there's a song that I is my most
[13:49] favorite song every time I think about
[13:52] this song I just it's just so much to me
[13:55] it's like sister Shannon this morning
[13:56] words can't explain it and it's a simple
[13:59] song but it's beautiful
[14:01] so yeah I'll try my best to play it

[28:24] have never felt your presence Lord
[28:27] may it be tonight I just pray heavier
[28:29] way and take control of this meeting and
[28:32] ask and in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:34] Christ amen
[28:35] you may be seated thank you well praise
[28:45] the Lord I had a wonderful day I really
[28:48] enjoyed the meeting this morning really
[28:51] good message and I thought it started to
[28:53] get better and better as it went along
[28:55] and there's a lot of little things which
[28:58] were said which maybe you called it or
[29:02] maybe it didn't but it was very profound
[29:04] and you know sometimes when you speak
[29:07] about the things of God the things which
[29:09] come out and you don't even know about
[29:11] it that's the things the Lord wants to
[29:13] emphasize on and tonight it's a
[29:17] communion and you know once you've had
[29:22] communion a few thousand times a few
[29:24] hundred times or how many times it
[29:26] appears to be the same thing every time
[29:31] but it's new every time and I like to
[29:35] look at it from a slightly different
[29:36] angle tonight but to begin with I still
[29:40] want to read just a passage in 1st
[29:42] Corinthians 11:23 234 about the
[29:46] communion and then we talk about one or
[29:48] two things here it says here for I have
[29:51] received of the Lord that which also I
[29:55] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[29:58] the same night in which he was betrayed
[30:00] took bread and when he had given thanks
[30:04] he broke it and said take heed
[30:08] this is my body which is broken for you
[30:13] this doing the remembrance of me after
[30:17] the same manner he also took the cup
[30:20] when he had supped saying this cup is
[30:23] the New Testament in my blood
[30:25] this do ye as oft as he drink it in
[30:28] remembrance of me for as often as he eat
[30:32] this bread and drink this cup you do
[30:35] show the Lord's death till he come
[30:39] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[30:41] and drink this cup of the Lord
[30:45] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[30:47] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[30:51] examine himself and so let him eat of
[30:54] that bread and drink of that Cup
[30:57] oh sorry drink of this cup of the Lord
[31:03] no I got mixed up I start again
[31:07] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[31:09] and drink this cup of the Lord
[31:12] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[31:13] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[31:16] examine himself and so let him eat of
[31:19] that bread and drink of that Cup for he
[31:23] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[31:25] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[31:28] not discerning the Lord's body
[31:31] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[31:33] among you and many sleep
[31:35] for if you we would judge ourselves we
[31:39] should not be judged but when we are
[31:42] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[31:45] we should not be condemned with the
[31:46] world wherefore my brethren when you
[31:49] come together to eat tarry one for
[31:52] another and if any man hunger let him
[31:55] eat at home that he come not together
[31:57] unto condemnation and the rest will has
[32:00] said in order when I come that is what
[32:03] we read every time we have communion and
[32:06] you know it's very interesting I have
[32:09] experienced it myself some people have
[32:12] different understandings of what
[32:14] communion means or what it does Woodhead
[32:18] commune in awhile ago and two brothers
[32:21] stood be
[32:22] didn't take communion because the heart
[32:25] wasn't right somewhere I know I said
[32:28] look let's pray ask the Lord to forgive
[32:31] you cleanse you put your hearts right
[32:34] and then their communion you say
[32:36] communion is not salvation communion is
[32:39] to remember the Lord and I like to read
[32:42] I've got three quotes written out which
[32:45] I like to read just a general
[32:48] understanding about communion his
[32:50] communion does not pertain to salvation
[32:54] communion does not give you salvation
[32:57] whether you take it in your death or
[33:01] what it does not have anything to do
[33:04] with your salvation it is a
[33:07] commemoration jesus said in the gospel
[33:10] he said this do in remembrance of me not
[33:14] in learning or leaning or pointing to
[33:17] salvation but in but it's in
[33:19] commemoration of a finished work that's
[33:23] been done in you by the Holy Spirit I
[33:26] love this it's a commemoration now
[33:31] there's many to take the communion
[33:33] they're not saved many eat the Paschal
[33:37] Lamb and perish in the wilderness and
[33:40] many take the communion today that will
[33:44] never see God I hope not here tonight
[33:48] but you cannot be a partaker of his
[33:52] salvation and not see him because
[33:55] salvation is a gift of God and communion
[34:00] is commemoration of the great
[34:03] all-sufficient sacrifice that was made
[34:05] for that salvation it's so to let people
[34:10] see that we believe in the death burial
[34:13] and resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[34:15] Christ it represents a finished work I
[34:18] think that gives you so much peace and
[34:22] rest well you know it's a finished work
[34:24] and so many times we we get trapped into
[34:29] thinking now we have to just finish it
[34:32] properly so there is a work to do
[34:35] but the work of Christ is finished like
[34:37] we read this morning we were perfected
[34:39] in heaven perfected so we we have a
[34:42] perfection an earthly perfection we
[34:46] tried to grow and and and come to a full
[34:49] understanding but in Christ we are
[34:52] perfected so communion we testify of
[34:58] that just we testify of it I'll give you
[35:01] another one here but in the offering of
[35:03] the shewbread that was laying on the
[35:06] kasha plate in the jewish sacrifice at
[35:09] the cleansing of the Tabernacles
[35:11] ask any Jew on those three pieces of
[35:14] bread
[35:15] the middle piece was broken there was
[35:19] Christ it's representing Christ the
[35:21] middle piece was broken Christ in the
[35:24] in-between showed that there had to be a
[35:28] breaking somewhere for redemption and
[35:31] their piece was considered Redemption
[35:34] and the caution on the kosher bread and
[35:36] here he is and tonight when we take the
[35:40] communion we break the cost bread for
[35:43] it's the body of Christ and he was
[35:47] broken to Calvary to be a propitiation
[35:50] for our sins that through his
[35:54] righteousness we might become his
[35:57] righteousness because he became our sin
[36:02] that we might become his righteousness
[36:06] brother that's purely grace absolutely
[36:08] there's no way any other way you could
[36:12] justify that's a scripture he became my
[36:16] sin so I will become his righteousness
[36:19] well what an exchange or an exchange you
[36:23] give him your misery and you give him
[36:26] give you your righteousness
[36:28] why because you believe in him I have
[36:31] many times in my early Christian days
[36:34] arguments with people especially with my
[36:37] mother
[36:38] and as a mother I say what the Bible
[36:42] says you say what do you think so I said
[36:45] what the Bible said that makes me right
[36:46] and you wrong
[36:49] what are your faith in Jesus Christ you
[36:52] become part of him and then you become
[36:55] what the word says it's not that we have
[36:59] to achieve something we already have it
[37:02] it's a free gift you know a gift a gift
[37:07] is something you cannot demand some
[37:10] people demand Lord I want this gift to
[37:12] soothe you to do this there was one in
[37:15] the Bible I want a gift so I lay hands
[37:17] on other people to get the Holy Ghost
[37:19] I want that gift too and I think it was
[37:22] Peters through him blind or whatever you
[37:24] know it was he called him the child of
[37:28] the devil yeah we can't demand gift we
[37:32] can ask for gifts but we cannot demand
[37:35] it or buy it or it's a gift and
[37:38] salvation is a gift or we can is
[37:41] accepted is it if it's offered to you if
[37:44] it's not offered to you
[37:46] you can't claim it you can't say yeah
[37:48] it's a gift
[37:49] Lord I like this gift and he says to you
[37:52] I've done it for you and then you say
[37:55] thank you Lord and then you receive it
[37:57] and then you have faith in what he's
[38:00] done for you and then you become
[38:03] righteous you become holy
[38:06] you become glorious like the scripture
[38:08] says nothing to do with our effort not
[38:12] at all give you one more here there's
[38:17] not many of us and we'll take the
[38:20] communion it is not closed a closed
[38:23] communion it is absolutely for every
[38:26] Christian believer God doesn't have the
[38:31] line drawn between Baptists and
[38:34] Methodists and so forth we all we are
[38:37] all by one spirit baptized into one body
[38:41] and we are fellow citizens of the
[38:44] kingdom of God and if there be someone
[38:47] among us who's strange I'm not here to
[38:51] and don't know who is members and who is
[38:54] not remember no matter what church you
[38:56] belonged to that has nothing to do with
[38:59] it there's only one church anyhow and
[39:04] you don't join it you born into it
[39:08] that's right then and you born into the
[39:11] this Church of God and we pray that you
[39:15] receive Christ tonight commune with him
[39:18] as we remember his broken body and these
[39:22] and these little elements that we take
[39:25] of the Passover and may God sprinkle our
[39:28] hearts and conscience with the blood so
[39:32] it is a body we are born into born into
[39:39] you know people talk about denominations
[39:44] you're the word denomination it has a
[39:48] common denominator that makes a
[39:54] denomination a common denominator and
[39:58] what's a common denominator of the
[40:01] Church of the Living God it to be born
[40:03] of the Spirit of God
[40:04] some people say they make a common
[40:07] denominator because they belong to a
[40:09] certain church or I'm in a message this
[40:13] is denominator you still have to be born
[40:15] again
[40:16] absolutely it leads you to them if you
[40:20] receive a correctly it leads you to that
[40:22] place but we like to identify we like to
[40:27] have a label we like to be part of
[40:29] something but the common denominator is
[40:32] the Holy Ghost filled with the Spirit of
[40:35] God you born again we a little while ago
[40:38] we had a a merry man come to church a
[40:43] prayer meeting he turned up and he asked
[40:45] if he's allowed to come to the prayer
[40:47] meeting very nice man and he said look
[40:51] he prayed and he sang and he was just
[40:55] part of it and he said look I'm catching
[40:58] a plane at midnight I went over us to
[41:00] Australia I'm going over there to see my
[41:03] old friends to tell him about
[41:04] Lord what the Lord's done he had found
[41:08] the Lord something happen in his life
[41:10] guess what I never even asked or church
[41:13] do you belong to where do you go to
[41:15] church which fellowship has nothing to
[41:17] do with it you know when you gods and
[41:21] when God calls you he calls you when you
[41:24] were in Egypt
[41:25] it doesn't call you when you're already
[41:27] in a promised land but it's the same
[41:29] Jesus that spoke to you way back when
[41:32] you were either a child or or or in you
[41:35] worst days of real life it was Jesus
[41:38] they talk to you he calls and visits you
[41:42] while you're in slavery while you
[41:44] imprisoned while you're in the world he
[41:46] visits you there and we sometimes think
[41:49] it's only Jesus after I've seen this
[41:53] after I've seen that that's not true
[41:55] that's not true you see it is important
[42:02] that we get together not only to
[42:05] encourage and help each other but also
[42:08] in order to express our faith in his
[42:11] word Jesus said in Matthew and that just
[42:14] struck me afresh slightly
[42:18] 18:24 where two or three are gathered
[42:22] together in my name there am I in the
[42:25] midst of them you know it is always
[42:30] exciting knowing that Jesus himself is
[42:33] at the meeting
[42:36] and as we gathered in his name he is
[42:41] here and they anything can happen but
[42:45] you know only people have faith belief
[42:48] that so if we go to church and you know
[42:53] some want to meet in the name of Jesus
[42:55] Christ you can be assured he's right
[42:58] there then anything can happen but those
[43:01] who have not faith it's just another
[43:03] scripture they quote sometimes and
[43:06] sometimes they don't but I believe is
[43:08] here and whether see him or not he's
[43:12] still here I absolutely believe that and
[43:16] the word says oh jesus said take eat
[43:21] this is my body which is broken for you
[43:25] this do in remembrance of me see we can
[43:32] see Calvary his body was broken his
[43:36] blood or we remember but as I said
[43:39] the same Jesus you may not have
[43:42] identified with Calvary at the time came
[43:45] to see you to visit you when he was
[43:48] still in the world I remember I remember
[43:54] you know it's funny this Labor weekend
[43:58] and brother Isaac's sister Shannon's
[44:02] wedding anniversary yeah remember it's
[44:05] really well because Jesus was there so I
[44:09] want to remember Jesus Christ who was at
[44:12] your wedding
[44:15] at communion day there was Jesus there
[44:20] was--there I always said there was the
[44:22] second best wedding I've ever been to it
[44:25] but it was such a sweet presence and I
[44:28] felt so privileged there was part of her
[44:32] I wasn't the bridegroom I wasn't the
[44:35] bride Isaac and Shannon but I was part
[44:38] of their picture a part of what when God
[44:42] was there I was part of it
[44:43] we sang that song sing Hosanna
[44:47] give me all in my lap sing Hosanna you
[44:50] scripture many rods riding into
[44:51] Jerusalem they put palm leaves and their
[44:55] coats on the ground was that a praise
[44:57] the Lord King you know I had an
[45:00] experience when I was I can't explain it
[45:05] but I was translated to Jerusalem
[45:08] I don't seen the crowd crying Hosanna I
[45:10] was crying at the end I was by myself a
[45:13] good hook come here again I was right
[45:16] there because Jesus was there and I
[45:20] remember that so I want to remember
[45:22] Jesus when he made himself real to me
[45:25] like and I want you tonight it's not
[45:30] Sunday school but I want you tonight to
[45:33] remember situations where you knew Jesus
[45:39] you know maybe 10 years ago 20 years ago
[45:43] five years ago yesterday today just
[45:46] remembering the Lord ministered to you
[45:48] spoke to you when he was right there
[45:51] with you I want to remember it tonight
[45:54] do these things in remembrance of me
[45:57] we never can't have a complete fullness
[46:00] understanding of what he's done on the
[46:03] cross until we can't see what he's done
[46:06] beforehand and what he's still doing
[46:09] today it's the same Jesus doing the same
[46:11] thing absolutely
[46:15] you know this labor weekend 1978 I want
[46:24] to remember Jesus okay
[46:26] labor weakens 978 I was dead lost in sin

[46:55] little square I saw two three people and
[46:57] one with a guitar and it was this merry
[47:00] fellow is a guitar

[47:04] past when I went from one pub to another
[47:08] edy comes 11 o'clock I was coming out
[47:13] the pub quite drunk so I went to him
[47:15] that's it you do a good job here convert
[47:20] those heathens out here I said to him
[47:22] that I believe in God you know I was
[47:25] hardly could stand up and you know Jesus
[47:29] was there he was in this man that's a
[47:35] one of the early encounters ahead and he
[47:38] looked at me was Isaac I can't explain
[47:42] such an expression he looked at me and
[47:45] said may I pray for you
[47:49] can I pray for you I wrestled what
[47:53] praying for me never heard of that I

[50:15] waiting room somewhere you know no and
[50:18] then I left at the call me back say look
[50:21] we have some address here from some
[50:24] people sometimes they have exchange
[50:26] students maybe I could give them a ring
[50:28] sure enough they rang up and I went
[50:32] there and they were Christians and they
[50:37] gave me a Bible
[50:38] I remember Jesus doing that
[50:41] I remember Jesus tonight on our way back
[50:45] home to New Plymouth as I read the Bible
[50:47] and he started convict me I tried to
[50:50] live a religious life and try to put
[50:52] things right and I tried so hard you
[50:56] know and then one night I smoked
[51:01] cigarette was it to my friend that's the
[51:04] last one ever smoked him alive
[51:05] he laughed because he seen me give up
[51:08] smoking so many times now in the bedroom
[51:11] and that's it Lord Jesus I know it's
[51:14] wrong to smoke I don't want to smoke
[51:17] please take it off me I was instantly
[51:20] delivered
[51:21] I remember Jesus tonight I remember
[51:24] Jesus what he's done in my life and I
[51:27] want you to remember when he came to you
[51:29] you see I was still in Egypt but was
[51:32] still Jesus the voice of God Moses spoke
[51:35] in Egypt first then speak in a promised
[51:39] land that was Joshua yeah but it was
[51:42] first in Egypt
[51:44] I know I've have been told no not that
[51:48] kind of been the Lord because he haven't
[51:50] heard the message who else leads you to
[51:55] in I may have shared that before but in
[52:00] 1982 I was on the business trip and I
[52:04] was in Saudi Arabia for three weeks and
[52:08] dinner in Dubai for a week and then
[52:10] after all that I took a holiday so I was
[52:14] booking I booked the plane to Egypt and
[52:17] then to Israel but tom was in Egypt
[52:20] I was so desperate for fellowship
[52:24] desperate you know you don't have
[52:27] fellowship in those Arab places this for
[52:30] for real fellowship I went on my knees
[52:33] and said Lord Jesus I would love to have
[52:38] fellowship please lead me to real
[52:42] children of God not just a church to
[52:44] real children of God you know I went to
[52:47] Jerusalem the next day hired the car
[52:49] whenever Jerusalem lost my way I thought
[52:54] and I worked in a hotel was a Jewish one
[52:57] and I talked to the receptionist and
[53:00] then I said what's what's all that stuff
[53:03] here is all that Sabbath regulations you
[53:06] know it's it's four o'clock you light
[53:08] the candles and you do this and you know
[53:10] this Jewish people are religious people
[53:13] she said she said you can go down to
[53:16] waste and wall and watch them pray I
[53:19] said hey I don't find pleasure in
[53:21] watching people pray I pray myself I'm a
[53:24] Christian and then I heard somebody in
[53:26] the background praise the Lord
[53:28] then his embarrassed young woman came
[53:32] out really embarrassed and her parents
[53:36] picked me up to a meeting the next day
[53:41] I remember Jesus answering my prayer
[53:43] answering my prayer it was the most
[53:46] wonderful meeting I was just sitting
[53:48] there knowing the Lord led me here and
[53:52] after the meeting people ask me
[53:55] questions you know what do you think you
[53:58] see when you get to heaven or how do you
[54:00] see this what do you think about she's
[54:03] women have long hair or you know all
[54:06] these questions are just answered and
[54:09] they said how do you know this not
[54:12] having heard of brother Branham who is
[54:15] he never heard of the man but I thought
[54:17] he must have been a good man if that's
[54:19] the product but you see Jesus was there
[54:23] and he led me and he still needs me so I
[54:27] want to remember those things and you
[54:29] know I want you to go back in your life
[54:32] to all these different points where you
[54:34] remember something the Lord stands for
[54:37] you we had a meeting a few years ago at
[54:41] home and it was a real sweet atmosphere
[54:45] I just felt just ask everyone to give a
[54:50] short testimony and there are thought of
[54:52] how they received the Holy Ghost but
[54:55] then I thought nope because not
[54:59] everybody had been through that
[55:02] experience so I said look everybody give
[55:04] a testimony of something that happened
[55:07] in your life where you know the Lord was
[55:09] there remembering Jesus that's what I
[55:12] was wanting them to do you know it came
[55:15] to the last person I think it was a
[55:17] woman and she said I was about 13 years
[55:23] old came home from school just when I
[55:27] was going into door a voice spoke and
[55:31] said don't go in she got a fright and
[55:34] rented an either inside the house was
[55:38] her dad who committed the suicide so the
[55:41] Lord stopped her from going in and then
[55:44] she said today I'm a Bronwyn I heard the
[55:50] same voice and I've always said I want
[55:53] you to be like here
[55:55] remembering Jesus she remembered she she
[56:00] wasn't there she hasn't had this Holy
[56:03] Spirit experience but she remembered the
[56:06] same God that spoke to her then spoke to
[56:09] her again well let's remember Jesus
[56:13] tonight when we take the communion just
[56:17] go in your mind to the places where he
[56:19] ministered to you where he spoke to you
[56:21] you may have been sitting in a meeting
[56:24] and something happened and it spoke to
[56:26] you remember Jesus speaking to you you
[56:29] know I can tell you hundreds of times
[56:33] with Jesus was there I mean every day
[56:37] and will never leave you nor forsake you
[56:40] he's always there he's here tonight if
[56:43] we can believe that when two or three
[56:45] are gathered in his name
[56:46] he's right in our midst praise the Lord
[56:50] welcome Holy Spirit welcomes know Jesus
[56:54] welcome it's a wonderful thing in 1984
[57:01] when I lived in a bush for four and a
[57:04] half months I tried to become a more
[57:07] holy person don't have to go to a bush
[57:09] for that I'll tell you that right now
[57:11] but you know when you're all on your own
[57:17] as much as the Lord is with you
[57:20] the devil is our deity trying to get you
[57:23] you know it's Christmas Eve I was
[57:26] sitting in that little house I was
[57:29] living in I hardly had any food I wasn't
[57:32] on a doll and I didn't have money so
[57:34] yeah I didn't eat very much at the time
[57:37] so I was there a little candle and the
[57:43] thought about when I was a child
[57:46] Christmas you know and then you know
[57:51] almost almost started emotional did they
[57:54] will try to come and look you're on your
[57:58] own and and you know all all that stuff
[58:02] no I thought no I'm not having that
[58:05] I didn't blow out the candle but I
[58:10] opened the Bible and they rate the story
[58:12] of his acquire and then I was so
[58:17] encouraged to read how God undertook for
[58:22] that man when the whole army of Syria
[58:26] was there - and told him T to surrender
[58:31] and all these things and no he trusted
[58:33] God
[58:34] now what did God - he slew 180,000
[58:38] people in the enemy's camp now I don't
[58:43] do that very often
[58:44] better do it for you I remember I have
[58:49] to read that Jesus came on the scene oh
[58:52] man I picked up the guitar and I just I
[59:05] started like this I mean I never knew
[59:09] you didn't have a song or anything just
[59:12] pick that up - guitar star walk around
[59:15] by a little hat and they started
[59:18] [Music]
[59:22] there is power in the name of Jesus
[59:29] Christ there is power in the God of all
[59:37] yet she slew hundred thousand in need
[59:46] there is power in the name of the Lord
[59:55] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:03] our God cream later this same
[1:00:09] [Music]
[1:00:23] his name I remember so clearly I was so
[1:00:35] you can see lowly I mean I was alone I
[1:00:39] was alone I remember Jesus coming on the
[1:00:44] scene I had such a glorious time because
[1:00:47] I wasn't alone he was there and it's
[1:00:52] good to remember Jesus it's good I was a
[1:00:56] Christian thing but I remember Jesus but
[1:00:59] it was in a world when he ministered to
[1:01:01] me when he helped me you know Bible says
[1:01:07] even if we are unfaithful yet he remains
[1:01:12] faithful so when God answers your
[1:01:16] prayers it's not a sign that you've been
[1:01:20] faithful not at all you know you answer
[1:01:24] prayers of demons Lord leaders going to
[1:01:27] the pigs
[1:01:28] the answered their prayers you know with
[1:01:31] something you think ho going to answer
[1:01:33] my prayers how much be right with God
[1:01:35] you know he's faithful but I remember
[1:01:39] Jesus I remember I remember that so many
[1:01:43] times when he just come on the scene
[1:01:46] come on a scene and look even in normal
[1:01:51] everyday circumstances I remember when
[1:01:54] we were a bit younger we have we still
[1:01:58] have quite a few children but we didn't
[1:02:01] have all that much money and remember
[1:02:04] one Saturday morning I went for a little
[1:02:06] Drive we had a little station wagon some
[1:02:09] visitors bought it and sold it to us
[1:02:11] really cheap after they finished their
[1:02:13] tour in New Zealand very very nice of
[1:02:16] them I drove to town and then I don't
[1:02:20] know I felt like I'm sort of not quite
[1:02:23] there but I went to a castle
[1:02:25] have a look of course when you go to
[1:02:27] castles it's like when you touch a
[1:02:29] spiderweb says straight out you know
[1:02:31] they come and you know and cut a long
[1:02:39] story short they sold me a car I went
[1:02:43] out for a quick drive and come home with
[1:02:44] another car ron was quite surprised the
[1:02:50] car was a bit dearer so I left my car as
[1:02:53] a trade-in some money and I had to pay
[1:02:57] them another I think another thousand
[1:03:00] dollars how we can do finances no I
[1:03:02] don't buy anything on higher pitches and
[1:03:05] I don't do that I said look I'm getting
[1:03:08] paid that day I can pay then and then in
[1:03:11] next 10 days I can pay it so we agreed
[1:03:15] and they they they gave me a little
[1:03:19] insurance with it you know for three
[1:03:22] months and and all that I went for a
[1:03:24] drive on Sunday was born to Rotorua came
[1:03:30] back and the car used over a liter of
[1:03:37] oil doing a hundred kilometres so it was
[1:03:40] short the motor so I went back on Monday
[1:03:44] and said look this car has a problem it
[1:03:48] needs to be fixed
[1:03:49] and the servants are no that looks pay
[1:03:51] for the insurance if you already come
[1:03:53] back with it you know I said now don't
[1:03:55] care how bad it looks I mean I've gotten
[1:03:57] insurance you sell me a car that's no
[1:04:00] good I want it fixed and then they took
[1:04:02] it and had a fixed then it needed new
[1:04:07] pistons and new rings and and the new
[1:04:10] clutch and all sorts I got a back no I
[1:04:14] didn't get it back they said I have to
[1:04:16] pay an extra I don't know $700 because
[1:04:21] the insurance only pays so much so I
[1:04:24] have to have another $700 or whatever it
[1:04:27] was I didn't have money I didn't think
[1:04:30] there was right so I got to be disturbed
[1:04:34] he's a rock if you don't pay you can
[1:04:37] have the car
[1:04:38] and then I lifted I went home then I
[1:04:42] went to work and shared it with a few
[1:04:44] people at work and you know the advice
[1:04:46] you get when you share things like that
[1:04:49] Oh take him to fair go take him to court
[1:04:52] do this you know all that kind of advice
[1:04:54] you get but I didn't feel comfortable
[1:04:56] with that
[1:04:57] so I had an appointment with the manager
[1:05:00] so I went there and the managers sit sit
[1:05:05] there behind is this consumers rude you
[1:05:07] know we're in business here you know
[1:05:09] you've got to pay and that's that's why
[1:05:12] this and then I remember Jesus I
[1:05:17] remembered Jesus I remembered tonight
[1:05:21] that Jesus came on the scene I remember
[1:05:24] so clearly you know suddenly something
[1:05:27] came over me I was super happy I mean
[1:05:32] you can't not but be happy in the
[1:05:33] presence of the Lord it's no other way
[1:05:35] I've felt the presence of the Lord I'm
[1:05:38] so super happy and you know I can't say
[1:05:41] what he said to me or hell but I know he
[1:05:44] was there
[1:05:45] unless it to the man yes I know you're
[1:05:49] in business
[1:05:50] so am i but you know my business is
[1:05:53] happening on a higher plane bit higher
[1:05:56] than yours so the way I do business with
[1:05:59] you I said you have I have my trade in
[1:06:01] you already sold it you have the money
[1:06:04] if the car you can keep the Lord and I
[1:06:07] walk from now on you know he turned
[1:06:10] white red green every color you can
[1:06:12] imagine and he said just take the car
[1:06:15] and go don't have to pay anything but I
[1:06:17] remember it was Jesus that came on the
[1:06:20] scene so I want to remember these things
[1:06:23] I don't want to tell these things yeah
[1:06:25] that's so many many times I I mean I can
[1:06:30] go on for hours when Jesus comes on the
[1:06:35] scene
[1:06:35] I remember you probably know all the
[1:06:41] story but when Christine and I worked at
[1:06:45] our little shop I used to have motorbike
[1:06:48] in the pocket in the back there was a
[1:06:50] restaurant there or another
[1:06:52] two three shops and one afternoon I want
[1:06:56] to go home go to know nokey motorbike a
[1:07:01] very complicated law
[1:07:03] I had no key they went out to the bike
[1:07:08] then I thought I lifted in the bike and
[1:07:13] somebody stole the key didn't steal the
[1:07:16] bike stole the key and I went back in
[1:07:20] the workshop and said lord I need that
[1:07:24] key show me where the key is what you
[1:07:28] have to switch off your natural mind and
[1:07:31] approach him in faith natural mind says
[1:07:34] how can you find it keep somebody stole
[1:07:36] it you want to go through people's
[1:07:38] pockets downtown or what do you want to
[1:07:40] do and I said show me where the key is a
[1:07:42] man I went out and I walked down that
[1:07:45] mall and looking for my key I was going
[1:07:49] downtown to go and look for the key you
[1:07:57] know at the end of the mall there was a
[1:07:59] gate there was two pillars I went to the
[1:08:03] left one went down on my knees and look
[1:08:07] praise God
[1:08:09] I remember Jesus showed me where the key
[1:08:13] was
[1:08:13] I remember Jesus tonight the same Jesus
[1:08:16] that I don't Calvary for me the same
[1:08:19] jesus showed me where the key was and
[1:08:22] you know there was a man in the
[1:08:25] restaurant next door here often came
[1:08:28] over quite sarcastic you know making
[1:08:30] silly jokes about Christianity and all
[1:08:32] that and running you down he was the
[1:08:36] first one I went to witness telling him
[1:08:39] how the Lord showed me where the key was
[1:08:41] I looked in his eyes and I said you know
[1:08:44] the law can show me who took it but I
[1:08:47] don't need to know it he'll see you know
[1:08:49] I'm pretty sure it was him but you know
[1:08:52] hiding it somewhere laughing to see me
[1:08:55] walking home and you know but the Lord
[1:08:57] showed me what it was I remember Jesus
[1:09:00] tonight you know the Lord is wonderful
[1:09:05] and I believe every one of us can
[1:09:08] remember a time with Jesus did something
[1:09:11] in your life I think every one of us we
[1:09:13] wouldn't even be here if nothing ever
[1:09:15] happened in your life we wouldn't be
[1:09:17] here but I want you tonight to remember
[1:09:21] Jesus as you take the bread and the wine
[1:09:26] remember when he called you when you
[1:09:29] were yet in your sins and the Bible says
[1:09:32] why we were yet sinners Christ died for
[1:09:35] us
[1:09:35] and it's it's so clear to me when you
[1:09:41] look at the children of Israel as a type
[1:09:45] here is Moses God spoke to them while
[1:09:52] they were yet in sin and slavery he
[1:09:56] spoke to them and he knew that most of
[1:09:59] them would forsake him again once he
[1:10:02] showed his power he spoke to them he
[1:10:05] laid them out with power he laid them
[1:10:08] through the Red Sea I always say he
[1:10:12] didn't delete them over through it you
[1:10:15] know if he come to a a big trial he lead
[1:10:18] his true he doesn't just transport you
[1:10:21] over it he leads his through he can do
[1:10:24] that I remember one other one just Bala
[1:10:27] say this where Jesus came on the scene
[1:10:31] we had visitors coming for three weeks a
[1:10:34] family and I had to pick him up in
[1:10:39] Auckland at midnight I was very very
[1:10:41] tired so I had to drive up there and
[1:10:43] then that took them ages until they came
[1:10:46] out through customs and all that and I
[1:10:48] was so tired and these people were tired
[1:10:52] and too and and the woman she had a well
[1:10:56] she had a little I don't know how to put
[1:11:01] it a little mental problem okay and that
[1:11:04] made it even worse I was driving and
[1:11:07] fighting with you know not my tiredness
[1:11:10] not to fall asleep I was driving and
[1:11:14] listen to all these things and then I
[1:11:16] said it's now we coming to
[1:11:18] Piru next place is why he and then I
[1:11:25] said the next place will be Katie Katie
[1:11:28] and you know Katie Katie never came next
[1:11:33] place it was just outside Toronto I
[1:11:36] don't know how that happened I was just
[1:11:38] there and I remember Jesus I can do that
[1:11:42] I checked the time it took me from
[1:11:45] Auckland to Tehran and it was a around
[1:11:49] 1/2 hours and you don't drive in one
[1:11:52] half hours from Auckland to Tara yeah
[1:11:54] even if you do hand the 50 all the way
[1:11:56] it wouldn't work you know it normally is
[1:11:59] - and the cooler air from the airport if
[1:12:01] you have no traffic 1/2 hours I was
[1:12:03] there I remember Jesus you know
[1:12:07] supernatural God our God and we want to
[1:12:11] remember him tonight in our lives what
[1:12:14] he's done in our lives and you know if
[1:12:16] God did only that much in your life if
[1:12:20] you haven't got all these tremendous big
[1:12:22] things but as long in all of us Jesus
[1:12:25] who did remember him tonight at that
[1:12:28] place where he ministered to you or did
[1:12:31] something for you remember him tonight
[1:12:33] as we eat the bread you know I always
[1:12:36] said when we did the communion you break
[1:12:38] off the breath because he was broken for
[1:12:41] you it's your doing that broke him your
[1:12:43] sin broke him so we take the bread we
[1:12:48] stand around in the front we take the
[1:12:50] bread we eat it all at once at the end
[1:12:53] and then remember Jesus try to remember
[1:12:57] Jesus if you want to pray pray if a
[1:13:00] scripture comes to your mind speak out
[1:13:01] the scripture if you feel like singing
[1:13:03] sing you know it's it's not a ritual you
[1:13:09] know it I'm not here having a ritual
[1:13:16] we're remembering Jesus tonight and I'd
[1:13:19] like you to remember Jesus you know you
[1:13:22] know when he spoke to you in your life
[1:13:24] you know when it was him who did
[1:13:27] something for you I want you to remember
[1:13:29] it tonight now so many wonderful things
[1:13:32] you know we can talk about him day and
[1:13:35] night so many wonderful things he's done
[1:13:37] in our lives and I remember so many
[1:13:40] things with the Lord's done for me you
[1:13:42] know and for others and for others and I
[1:13:46] was allowed to be part of that picture
[1:13:49] no I want to close with this before we
[1:13:52] have communion you know when my children
[1:13:55] were smaller you know sometimes you want
[1:13:58] to entertain them and yeah just one
[1:14:03] thing we used to have our celebration
[1:14:07] night on Friday and then I used to do
[1:14:11] something special with them or we had a
[1:14:14] special treat or something like there
[1:14:16] they always looked forward to
[1:14:17] celebration night and one night I was
[1:14:20] busy I had to do something so I didn't
[1:14:22] know what to do so I had a few old
[1:14:24] business cards of mine which we're
[1:14:26] obsolete and I've just handed out three
[1:14:30] cards see if we want and said look just
[1:14:31] write down on the back of the cards what
[1:14:35] you really would like I said it's not
[1:14:38] that daddy will give it to you but so I
[1:14:40] know what you like and just thought it
[1:14:43] gives me a ten-minute break he gave
[1:14:46] those cards and disappear in my room and
[1:14:49] of course that came out again and then
[1:14:52] sit down again and then cats came
[1:14:55] Albert's oh what a chainsaw strawberries
[1:15:01] and then Melanie chocolate fish and and
[1:15:06] all these different things you know what
[1:15:08] the children desired and then and then
[1:15:12] neck Christine was you card and then
[1:15:15] there's she looked all strange you know
[1:15:17] I didn't know what's going on then she
[1:15:18] threw them there took the card empty
[1:15:22] next one empty next one I want to give
[1:15:26] my heart to the Lord you know what is it
[1:15:29] I remember Jesus was they that no that's
[1:15:32] I remember you see these things I was
[1:15:35] part of their picture I remember I was
[1:15:39] in my room and I don't say that for an
[1:15:41] example but you know when you have a lot
[1:15:44] of children
[1:15:45] they always knock on the door you can't
[1:15:48] even go to bathroom there's somebody
[1:15:49] knocking and calling you you know it's
[1:15:51] this way this that's the way it is and
[1:15:54] you can't get away from things so so I
[1:16:00] went to my room 10:30 at night I said
[1:16:06] get away get away
[1:16:11] you don't leave me alone third time
[1:16:13] leave me alone fourth time open the door
[1:16:17] what do you want xalbert
[1:16:20] I wanna give my heart to the Lord oh man
[1:16:27] that changed things I said oh come in we
[1:16:31] maintain our knees we prayed together
[1:16:33] you know I know the Lord was there and
[1:16:36] he learned very early in life what it
[1:16:38] means to prison you know that's really
[1:16:42] at the prison and you know you know he
[1:16:45] turned off this doesn't work you turned
[1:16:48] away nothing seems to work
[1:16:49] you press in anyway that's what I love
[1:16:52] about this morning about the message you
[1:16:54] know it's you and God it's you God
[1:16:57] you know you got Church the one next to
[1:17:00] you you might not like the people or you
[1:17:02] might not like somebody else who cares
[1:17:05] it's between you and the Lord if you
[1:17:07] believe that Jesus is here tonight you
[1:17:09] want to be in church wouldn't you you
[1:17:12] want to be where he is and I believe
[1:17:14] there's more than two or three here
[1:17:16] gathered in his name so he is here and
[1:17:19] we remember our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:17:22] Christ
[1:17:23] you know just closes this one we had we
[1:17:30] had this aboard an old picture frame
[1:17:34] sometimes I used to go to the auction
[1:17:36] once a week and they had oh you know
[1:17:40] five picture frames for a dollar or you
[1:17:43] know really a whole box full of stuff
[1:17:45] and the children like that you know I
[1:17:47] said the race we can dump again you know
[1:17:49] if it's no good it only costs a dollar
[1:17:51] so I had this big picture frame and so I
[1:17:55] just took the picture I turned it around
[1:17:57] was nothing
[1:17:58] fancy and then scribbled through a
[1:18:00] little house on it and the children
[1:18:02] sitting around and I said oh look he is
[1:18:04] it house and here is a farm dog and then
[1:18:08] I made a little pond ELISA pond and he
[1:18:10] little ducks and and up there put a
[1:18:12] little aeroplane in the air and the
[1:18:15] hot-air balloon and here a train line
[1:18:18] and everything here's captain here's
[1:18:21] burden and the children had always
[1:18:24] called it the busy picture busy picture
[1:18:27] and I say that in relation to what I
[1:18:31] said about the Isaac and channels
[1:18:34] wedding it was a picture so the picture
[1:18:39] was there's a bride and the groom
[1:18:41] getting married and the Lord was there I
[1:18:44] know that but there was the beach there
[1:18:47] was to see there was but I was there as
[1:18:49] part of the picture and when you see
[1:18:52] this busy picture even if you're a
[1:18:55] little bird somewhere you had to find
[1:18:58] you part of the big picture and you part
[1:19:00] of the Lord's picture and it's such a
[1:19:03] blessing just to know we part of it if
[1:19:06] we're there when it happens we part of
[1:19:08] it where a witness would we've been
[1:19:10] there when the Lord moves we've been
[1:19:12] there when things that were happening we
[1:19:15] part of the picture we may not be the
[1:19:17] main character but we privileged to be
[1:19:20] part of it and I love that so tonight we
[1:19:26] believe by faith his word there were two
[1:19:31] or three appear that he's in elements so
[1:19:34] if Jesus is here like I said anything
[1:19:37] can happen
[1:19:38] so when we take the communion as I said
[1:19:41] who we can meet those who take the
[1:19:45] communion perhaps stand here around near
[1:19:48] the front and oh should I hand it out
[1:19:53] okay I'll hand out the bread you break
[1:19:56] your own breed off and then we eat it
[1:19:59] all together and that's the Lord
[1:20:02] ministers to you if as you remember the
[1:20:06] Lord praise them to remember a scripture
[1:20:10] speak it out
[1:20:12] whatever the Lord lays on you have
[1:20:13] because we are here to remember Lord
[1:20:16] Jesus Christ amen can I ask you to come
[1:20:19] forward please
