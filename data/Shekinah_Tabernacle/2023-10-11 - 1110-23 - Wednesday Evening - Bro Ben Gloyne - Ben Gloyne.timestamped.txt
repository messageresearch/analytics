[20:59] we want to go to Ezekiel chapter 28 1-6

[21:03] um this is our last Wednesday service
[21:06] before Camp so next weekend is Camp
[21:09] who's excited for Camp amen praise God
[21:12] so next Wednesday we're going to be
[21:14] packing up sound and all those things we
[21:15] W have a midweek service before camp or
[21:18] after camp and then um after the service
[21:19] on Sunday we'll have a quick meeting
[21:21] about who's doing what and everything to
[21:23] you know for camp and so on Amen so
[21:25] let's uh read from Ezekiel 28: 1 6 I
[21:28] know it's a prayer meeting night so I'll
[21:29] try and be try and be brief um but I
[21:32] thought that's such a fitting song I
[21:33] give myself away that you can use me
[21:36] because there's a question uh we're all
[21:38] gifted people amen we all have a gift
[21:40] and the question I want to pose to you
[21:42] tonight is uh is God using the gift or
[21:44] are you using it so I thought the song's
[21:48] good amen to to go on this so Ezekiel
[21:50] 28: 1-6 says the word of the Lord came
[21:54] again unto me saying son of man say unto
[21:56] the prince of Tyrus thus sayith the Lord
[21:59] God because thine heart is lifted up and
[22:01] thou H has said I am a God I sit in the
[22:04] seat of God in the midst of the Seas yet
[22:06] thou art a man and not God thou Hast set
[22:09] thine heart as the heart of God behold
[22:12] Thou Art wiser than Daniel there is no
[22:15] secret that they can hide from thee with
[22:18] thy wisdom and with thy understanding
[22:20] notice what he's done with it thou has
[22:21] gotten the riches thou has gotten gold
[22:24] and silver into thy Treasures by thy
[22:27] great wisdom and by thy traffic thou um
[22:30] hast thou increased thy riches and thine
[22:32] heart is lifted up because of thy riches
[22:34] therefore thus sayith the Lord God
[22:36] because thou H has set thine heart as
[22:39] the heart of God I just want to leave
[22:42] finish reading there and then we're
[22:44] going to go to Luke uh 7 and 36 and I
[22:47] pray the Lord tie this together because
[22:49] there's the question of a using the gift
[22:51] or is God using it and then I want to
[22:52] kind of subtitle it the evolution of a
[22:54] Pharisee this may be kind of a we're
[22:56] having a Prem meeting about this this is
[22:58] where we are so Luke 7 and 36 very
[23:01] familiar piece of scripture here uh
[23:04] where where the Lord is Anointed amen
[23:06] the alabaster box the woman in the
[23:09] alabaster box we're just going to read a
[23:10] couple of uh verses here not the whole
[23:12] uh story but yeah Luke 736
[23:15] to39 and it says here and one of the
[23:17] Pharisees desired him that he would eat
[23:20] with him and he went into the Pharisees
[23:22] house and sat down to meet and behold a
[23:25] woman in the city which was a sinner
[23:27] when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in
[23:29] the Pharisees house brought an alabaster
[23:31] box of ointment and stood At His Feet
[23:34] behind him weeping and began to wash his
[23:36] feet with tears and did wipe them with
[23:38] the hairs of her head and kissed her his
[23:40] feet and anointed them with the ointment
[23:43] now when the Pharisee which had bidden
[23:45] him saw it he spake within himself
[23:47] saying this man if he were a prophet
[23:50] would have known who and what manner of
[23:52] woman this is that touched him for she
[23:55] is a sinner a amen let's just bow our
[23:58] heads in a word of prayer if you want to
[23:59] be remembered to prayer just raise your
[24:01] hand to the Lord tonight amen gracious
[24:03] father you see all the hands that are
[24:05] raised and Lord we just want to give
[24:08] ourselves away to you that you can use
[24:10] us oh God like never before thank you
[24:13] Father we can gather in this manner Lord
[24:15] I pray dear God you'd anoint speaker and
[24:17] hearer one more time lord as we have
[24:19] this midweek service this prayer meeting
[24:20] Lord I pray you just take over lord
[24:22] father may you bind every unclean Spirit
[24:24] that's not of you in the name of Jesus
[24:26] Christ I pray your blood would cover us
[24:28] all Lord those here and those who may be
[24:30] watching by the way of YouTube and may
[24:32] you just have preeminence in our lives
[24:33] Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[24:37] God bless you you may have your seats
[24:38] tonight so yeah so that's my question is
[24:41] God using the gift or are you using it
[24:43] we know that everyone has a gift in
[24:45] their lives and whether it may be
[24:47] preaching music it could be helps
[24:48] governments you we know every everyone
[24:50] has a gift of faith in their lives but
[24:52] you know notice here as as as uh God
[24:55] would God would speak through Ezekiel to
[24:57] the king of Tyrus is isn't it amazing
[25:00] that this man was wiser than Daniel now
[25:02] Daniel was a very wise man you know God
[25:05] he knew how to you know you know uh he
[25:08] God showed him from from his time to the
[25:09] time of the end you know through the
[25:11] Gentile dispensations he showed him many
[25:13] things he showed him the dream that
[25:15] Nebuchadnezzar had that even
[25:16] Nebuchadnezzar didn't even know the
[25:18] dream you know he's full of wisdom and
[25:20] understanding was Daniel but yet this
[25:21] man was wiser than Daniel and it goes to
[25:24] show as the Bible would tell us that
[25:26] gifts and callings are without
[25:27] repentance so it's got nothing to do a
[25:30] gift or you know a gift in a person's
[25:32] life has nothing to do with where they
[25:34] surrender to God not surrender to God
[25:36] we're born with a gift now this man was
[25:38] a very a was a very very wise man to be
[25:42] wiser than Daniel wouldn't you like the
[25:44] wisdom of Daniel amen amen wouldn't you
[25:47] like that kind of wisdom understanding
[25:48] to walk in a gentile world Amen and be
[25:51] undefiled by it I Believe by the blood
[25:52] of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the
[25:54] Holy Ghost we can walk that way am me
[25:56] but you see this man was was wiser than
[25:58] Daniel but you as we read through there
[26:00] you I'm sure you could notice now that
[26:03] that that he used that gift in his life
[26:05] to gather Treasures to himself he used
[26:07] that gift in his life not that God would
[26:09] be glorified but that he himself would
[26:11] be glorified and he got so lifted up in
[26:14] Pride that he says I sit as a God and he
[26:17] even says that I have set my heart as
[26:19] the heart of God what a terrible
[26:21] position to be in to think that my
[26:24] heart's like God's heart in in his own
[26:26] ability am mean what a what a terrible
[26:29] thing to use a Incredible Gift for just
[26:31] ill gotten gain that is going to be
[26:33] vaporized anyway I mean but but but this
[26:35] is what this man had had done and and so
[26:38] it's amazing where a person can be a
[26:40] very gifted person but they can they can
[26:43] instead of surrendering their life to
[26:44] the Lord and letting God use that gift
[26:47] they will use it Satan will allow them
[26:49] to use it to build a kingdom around
[26:51] themselves amen and you know we we never
[26:53] want to come into this kind of position
[26:56] you know brother Bram would tell us that
[26:57] you know a family can start out you know
[26:59] and they can start going to church God
[27:01] can heal the little family he can bless
[27:03] them with the Holy Spirit in their life
[27:05] the little children will pray around the
[27:06] table they'll pray before they go to bed
[27:08] father and mother will join hands and
[27:10] pray and as long as they continue like
[27:12] that they'll stay a family but let me
[27:14] see the first thing you know they didn't
[27:16] have nothing an old junk car maybe
[27:18] riding around in maybe walking finally
[27:20] they'll get a good CH car a better home
[27:23] the first thing you know they'll want to
[27:25] go with what they call the world calls a
[27:27] better class to associate with they move
[27:29] into a different neighborhood and there
[27:31] they find out they become influenced by
[27:33] the wrong influence you know I don't
[27:35] believe that king of tus would have
[27:37] started off being how he ended up you
[27:39] know like Solomon he didn't he didn't
[27:40] start how he ended and but but we want
[27:42] to end how
