[27:42] tonight like our man always said is
[27:44] Wednesday and you made
[27:46] it good
[27:48] job
[27:50] amen let's open our Bibles the books of
[27:54] um
[27:56] Hebrews thank you
[28:00] chapter
[28:04] 11 verse
[28:17] 36 and the Bible says um and alls had
[28:21] Trials of cruel mocking
[28:25] and scorin oh what however you say that
[28:28] word ye more of Bones and princ Ms they
[28:33] were Stone they were swn as s were
[28:36] tempted were slain with a sword they
[28:40] wander about in sheep skins and gold
[28:43] skins being destitute Afflicted
[28:47] tormented of whom the world was not
[28:50] worthy they wandered in deserts and in
[28:53] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[28:56] earth and this all
[28:59] having obtained a good report through
[29:01] faith receive not the promise God having
[29:05] provided some better things for us that
[29:07] day without us so should not be made
[29:11] perfect amen let's bow ahead almighty
[29:15] God we want to give you thanks because
[29:17] you are an awesome God Lord thank you
[29:19] Lord for bringing us to your house
[29:23] tonight in this moment Lord in public I
[29:27] recognize that I'm no one Lord and I
[29:29] need you to talk to your people so
[29:31] please Lord use my lips to bless your
[29:34] people in Jesus Christ's name I ask you
[29:37] this amen amen you may have your
[29:42] seat I love the chapter is Hebrews 11 is
[29:45] just
[29:46] awesome amen and what I want to talk
[29:50] tonight is the
[29:52] grit now I didn't know the meaning of
[29:55] this word but I hear it before so I went
[29:58] to Google and says like like a kind of
[30:00] sand but I was like no that's not the
[30:03] grd that brother B was talking
[30:06] about so I search it and grit is
[30:10] a grit is a personality trait possessed
[30:14] by individuals who demonstrate passion
[30:17] and perseverance towards a goal despite
[30:20] being confronted by significant
[30:23] obstacles and destructions oh my all
[30:26] this
[30:29] brothers that die and give their lives
[30:32] for the gospel they had the great they
[30:35] had a
[30:38] backbone
[30:40] now greed is not a word that you can
[30:42] find in the
[30:43] Bible but there are two words and
[30:45] they're very similar one of them is a
[30:47] stead
[30:49] fastness fastness sorry the quality of
[30:52] being resolutely or that dutifully how
[30:57] do you say that word
[30:59] um fear and I'm
[31:03] wavering so after reading that I was
[31:05] like I need another description for that
[31:07] word because I didn't understand any of
[31:09] those words and said the quality of
[31:11] staying the same for a long time and not
[31:14] changing quickly or
[31:17] unexpectedly they made up their minds
[31:19] and they were going to follow Christ and
[31:21] they follow Christ till the end that's
[31:23] it they didn't care about the end the
[31:26] way that they were going to die they
[31:28] just decided to follow Christ and they
[31:31] did
[31:31] it the other
[31:33] word that it sounds like grit kind of
[31:37] similar it's endurance and endurance is
[31:39] the ability to endure an unpleasant or
[31:43] difficult process or situation without
[31:46] giving way yeah the capacity of
[31:48] something to last or to withstand where
[31:52] and here so people that they go to a
[31:55] marathon and they run they have
[31:58] endurance they have run and run and run
[32:01] for like
[32:02] 10ks and they made it at the
[32:06] end
[32:08] now in 2
[32:10] Kings chapter 5 there's a beautiful
[32:14] story and I like this
[32:16] story it says verse two and the syrians
[32:20] had gone out by companies and had
[32:23] brought away captives out of the land of
[32:26] Israel a little man
[32:28] and she waited
[32:30] at how do you say the name of this guy
[32:32] N N's wife and she said unto her
[32:37] mistress will God my Lord wherewith the
[32:40] prophet that is in Samaria for the wood
[32:42] recover him of his
[32:44] leprosy and one went in and told his
[32:47] Lord saying thus and thus said the maid
[32:50] that is in the land of
[32:52] Israel this little
[32:54] lady she was just a princess amen and
[32:58] the Bible doesn't say her
[33:00] name but she was so important she was
[33:04] too captive there was no Mommy and
[33:08] Daddy but she trusted the Lord and she
[33:11] was still a Christian
[33:13] Amen in that situation without mommy and
[33:15] daddy where will you
[33:18] stand he testimony she
[33:21] said to um neon's wife there is a man
[33:26] that can help you oh
[33:28] I trust the Lord that you all kids you
[33:32] you can be a testimony like that girl
[33:35] you have no idea the impact of your
[33:37] words cuz she was a little my dad told
[33:41] me that when he was little he was not
[33:43] allowed to talk on the table that was
[33:46] something that only grown up were able
[33:48] to do but that little lady she didn't
[33:51] care about that because she
[33:53] knew something that could help that guy
[33:59] I trust the Lord that you can put your
[34:01] name in that situation
[34:04] amen now this lady she hadit a backbone
[34:07] and now the backbone is a the spine or
[34:10] backbone is a bony structure that
[34:12] supports your body it connects different
[34:14] parts of
[34:16] your what do I do this thing system
[34:21] which include your body's bones and
[34:25] muscles but in Spanish is muscular skto
[34:28] you try to say that
[34:31] thing now we have these creatures in the
[34:34] nature they are
[34:36] called jelly jellyfish they have no
[34:39] backbone uhuh yeah the amazing what's
[34:42] amazing is like they actually can
[34:45] swim but they're not strong enough so
[34:48] when the wave push them to one side they
[34:51] just have to go to that side CU they
[34:53] cannot swim strong enough to get out of
[34:56] there w
[34:59] now if you're a Christian you're going
[35:01] to have a backbone that can help you to
[35:03] swim out of the tides otherwise you're
[35:06] going to get drag to any
[35:09] situation any Trend or anything you're
[35:13] going to get just Dru any I'm going to
[35:16] stop it there I'm
[35:18] sorry brother Brandon says you say well
[35:22] I've been a timid person Moses said the
[35:25] same thing just reminds me one time over
[35:28] a football stadium I was preaching in I
[35:31] walk in it said a little sign up over
[35:34] there said it is not the size of the dog
[35:36] in the fight is the size of the fight in
[35:39] the dog so that's a good idea you may
[35:42] not be very big but get a lot of things
[35:46] about you but you get a lot of fight
[35:48] about about you you got to get into it
[35:52] anything I he to see is a spineless
[35:54] person call himself a Christian my God
[35:59] God want somebody with greit and
[36:02] backbone I like old buddy Robinson said
[36:06] Lord give me the backbone the size of a
[36:09] soul L put plenty of knowledge in the
[36:13] gable gable and of my soul and let me
[36:17] fight the devil as long as I got one
[36:19] Toth and then gum him till I
[36:24] die and he did that's right I that he go
[36:28] down in this in the cornfield and he
[36:31] said Lord if you don't give me the
[36:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost when you come
[36:36] back to earth you are going to find a
[36:38] pile of bones laying right here God gave
[36:41] him the Holy Ghost you go to get
[36:43] determinate that's right get ready take
[36:46] over God said so let's go take
[36:49] over that's what God wants wanted us to
[36:53] do amen that's what God want us to do
[36:56] tonight God always willing to give us if
[36:59] you were ready to receive it that's
[37:02] right God's made the promise so it is
[37:05] ours the promise is unto you and to your
[37:08] children to them that far off even as
[37:11] many as the Lord God shall call so the
[37:14] promise is here amen amen amen another
[37:19] um like an example of fight it's like
[37:22] when Paul wrote
[37:24] to Timothy or timoo
[37:28] says I have fought a good fight I have
[37:31] finished my course my race I have kept
[37:34] the
[37:35] faith hence for there is laid up for me
[37:39] a crown of righteousness with the Lord
[37:42] the righteous judge shall give me at
[37:45] that day and not to me only but unto all
[37:48] them also that love his
[37:52] appearance let the Lord help us to
[37:55] finish this race it cannot be easy and
[37:58] it's not going to
[38:01] be easy all the
[38:04] time but we're going to Made It by the
[38:06] Lord's Grace I hope you can see that
[38:09] that's a 12 Apostles and the way that
[38:12] their lives physical life
[38:14] ended so he say that Peter was
[38:18] crucified upside down Matthew he was
[38:22] beheaded Andrew crucified on an x-shaped
[38:25] cross Thomas P with a spear James
[38:29] beheaded
[38:31] James CED to death John died for an old
[38:35] aged Simon sown in half Philip crucified
[38:40] Jude be HED of um covered to death sorry
[38:45] bomeo sorry I'm not going to say that
[38:48] it's just way too strong for the kids
[38:51] and Judas he commits
[38:54] swde that was not easy guys to die for
[38:58] the cause of Christ back then was really
[39:02] hard you had to give gave your life the
[39:06] Lord give them the strength and the
[39:09] spirit to die for for
[39:12] him so don't give up
[39:18] amen now that's that kind of second
[39:21] theme Here I really would like to talk
[39:24] to you about kind of friendship our
[39:27] talks about this and I was like yes this
[39:30] is important but he was a young person
[39:33] ages ago
[39:36] [Laughter]
[39:40] and so in that age when you can see
[39:43] those kids probably they're like seven
[39:45] eight you can be friend with pretty much
[39:48] anyone anyone there's not much
[39:50] difference you just want to play some
[39:54] soccer and eat some lollies and that's
[39:56] it
[39:58] but when you car on
[40:00] groin there's some differences that
[40:03] start to appear and this is for you
[40:08] guys cuz um yeah uh I was not able I
[40:11] didn't have a backbone back then when I
[40:14] was
[40:15] young and
[40:20] um yeah it's tough cuz you trying to fit
[40:24] with your friends at school but they are
[40:26] not the same
[40:28] you're
[40:30] different and I hope you can realize
[40:32] that you're
[40:33] different in a good way hallelujah amen
[40:38] so when you start
[40:40] growing then the boys they don't want to
[40:43] be boys anymore they want to be men and
[40:45] what's a mean men is someone that smokes
[40:48] and drinks and go out with girls and if
[40:51] you're not careful you're going to ended
[40:54] up the same way
[40:57] that's what happened outside there come
[41:00] on but if you have the True Grit if you
[41:04] are strong enough in your faith you're
[41:06] going to be able to shine outside there
[41:08] because we can come here on Wednesday or
[41:11] Sundays and we can put our holy face
[41:14] that's right but the important thing is
[41:16] when we are out of here when the people
[41:18] can see us and if they cannot see any
[41:21] difference why are they going to even
[41:23] try to be Christians
[41:28] when
[41:30] um I remember when I was in the world I
[41:34] always had like
[41:36] a respect for those guys that were that
[41:39] they were trying to be Christian cuz I
[41:40] was not trying at all and even when some
[41:43] people they were making fun of them I
[41:45] was like don't make fun of them these
[41:49] guys are actually doing
[41:51] something I remember that um there was a
[41:54] girl that she used to drink and go out
[41:59] with us and she was it looks very bad in
[42:02] a girl but that girl from one day to
[42:05] another one she she stopped going out
[42:08] with
[42:09] us and something happened she's said
[42:13] going to church and from one day to
[42:16] another one she was different she didn't
[42:18] want to be called with the same nickname
[42:20] she wanted to be called by her real name
[42:25] Jasmine and she started look happy all
[42:27] the time and I remember I said to my
[42:31] friend I need
[42:33] that I knew exactly what it was cuz I
[42:36] grew up in church yeah but I didn't have
[42:39] the true
[42:40] greet but the life that you live outside
[42:45] is an important thing because people can
[42:47] see that you have something different
[42:49] imagine if that girl wouldn't never
[42:51] change I would never say that thing like
[42:54] I need that but she was able to shine
[42:58] outside and that's important
[43:00] thing amen
[43:04] um yeah for the boys
[43:07] like it is hard
[43:10] sometimes when you can see all your
[43:12] friends going starting to going out with
[43:14] GS and stuff but you know what's right
[43:17] and it can happen the same thing that
[43:19] happened to Israel when then decided to
[43:21] follow a man instead to keep having
[43:24] Christ God as a king don't trust in
[43:29] yourself trust in the Lord amen
[43:32] amen and
[43:36] um
[43:38] yeah I also remember CU I didn't have
[43:43] any grit on me I
[43:47] was I was going to
[43:50] church but I was not in church I didn't
[43:53] want it to be in church when I was a
[43:55] teenage I didn't want it to be in church
[43:58] so I start living like a double
[44:02] life so outside the doors of my house I
[44:05] was swearing and I was I I had a pirates
[44:10] mouth my parents they didn't grab me
[44:13] like that but I was just swearing every
[44:15] second word in my mouth was just a
[44:17] swearing word I was swearing swearing
[44:21] swearing and um after a
[44:25] while I had to start thinking cuz if I
[44:27] was with my friends I had to be one
[44:30] person and if I was at home I had to be
[44:33] another person and if I was in church I
[44:36] had to be another person wow and after a
[44:39] while I got good I was just able to be
[44:43] different different and
[44:49] different but that's not
[44:52] life the hard thing was when my friends
[44:55] they were going to my house and I had
[44:58] to contact like in a
[45:02] man I was shocked because I had to
[45:05] behave for my parents and when my
[45:06] parents were not there I had to be with
[45:08] my friends
[45:09] and you don't want that in your life
[45:12] make you sure that
[45:14] you to pray the Lord and to give you the
[45:17] strength just to be the same at the same
[45:21] here that there is in church brother AB
[45:24] brother
[45:25] Ruben the same that's here has to be
[45:29] outside you are so important you are a
[45:33] light in your
[45:34] school why you we have to be lights
[45:38] outside
[45:39] there and it's just very important I
[45:42] didn't prepare this much I'm so
[45:46] sorry
[45:48] but this is like something that always
[45:51] come to my mind
[46:01] there's a message
[46:05] called I can't talk it's your life

[46:11] gospel and it's a high
[46:13] one but I love to hear

[46:24] um our lives
[46:28] by the grace of God has to
[46:30] be worthy of the gospel and it's not
[46:34] going to be easy all the time because
[46:36] you have to give up heaps of things that
[46:38] they are not good good for you
[46:42] anyways but that's what the Lord wants
[46:44] from you that your life can be worthy of
[46:48] this cuz when you are outside and there
[46:51] is some people that they know that
[46:53] you're Christian yeah and you're not
[46:55] conducting like a Christian
[46:57] L you are giving to the gospel a bad
[47:03] name everyone knows how a Christian is
[47:07] supposed to be but no one's want to be a
[47:09] Christian because it's hard and some
[47:12] people
[47:13] like for some people it's just so easy
[47:16] to say is that guy know a Christian why
[47:20] he's doing that
[47:22] thing help us Lord to please leave a
[47:26] life life just worthy of
