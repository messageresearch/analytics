[31:30] relationship it's not just us always
[31:32] rejoicing and looking up and worshiping
[31:34] but God is rejoicing
[31:36] with us amen hallelujah I won't keep you
[31:40] standing I think I can turn on here I
[31:44] want to continue on from the series now
[31:49] while we call it a series but just the
[31:51] second part of when the valleys and
[31:54] mountains meet and perfect love and the
[31:58] actual subject is a climate of love and
[32:02] amen
[32:04] there is a background behind love and
[32:06] what it brings and actually we know that
[32:10] the Lord is love and he is revealing
[32:12] himself and the epitome of his love and
[32:15] this in time as the capstone Amen so in
[32:19] homer's all things that we have need of
[32:21] amen and the pillar of fire with all the
[32:23] things that Moses needed for the journey
[32:25] and all things that we would need for
[32:27] the journey amen no matter how dark it
[32:30] gets that pillar of fire will lead us
[32:31] amen hallelujah so let's turn in our
[32:36] Bibles our sorry you have to turn them
[32:37] oh I don't have any scriptures on this
[32:39] but we will just read from Isaiah
[32:42] chapter 40 and we'll read verses 3 to 5
[32:46] amen and I wanted to clear something
[32:49] right now
[32:50] now listen very carefully to this and I
[32:53] know that you already know this but I
[32:55] just have to say it anyway you know how
[32:56] the Lord just has he's quite the Lord is
[32:58] a symbolic person he's he he likes to do
[33:02] things that mean something symbolically
[33:07] amen
[33:08] the climate of love is here amen
[33:14] hallelujah I like to say that because
[33:17] that's a powerful thing the climate of
[33:19] love is here the voice of him that
[33:24] crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the
[33:27] way of the Lord and make straight in the
[33:31] desert a highway for our God oh my I'm
[33:35] so glad that there is a highway that's
[33:37] been made you know man I'm gonna start
[33:39] I'll just keep going hold on every
[33:41] Valley shall be exalted and every
[33:43] mountain and Hill shall be made low and
[33:46] the crooked shall be made straight and
[33:48] the rough places plain and the glory of
[33:51] the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh
[33:56] shall see it together for the mouth of
[34:01] the Lord has spoken it may the Lord add
[34:03] is blessing to the reading of his word
[34:04] you may be seated
[34:12] I'm so glad that Elisha has come I'm so
[34:17] thankful because you see now we find
[34:21] that this week if we read this from a
[34:24] historical perspective here we see that
[34:27] this prophecy was was was to describe
[34:30] John the Baptist ministry it was to
[34:33] describe the dynamics and the the
[34:37] intention that God had to sin John the
[34:40] Baptist to clear everything out and just
[34:43] create a climate where the people that
[34:46] was following the past and the things
[34:49] that God had done and he had been placed
[34:52] back into a historical condition to
[34:55] bring it forward to turn the hearts of
[34:58] the people and clear all that and make a
[35:00] highway amen
[35:02] we were talking about highways in South
[35:04] Africa last night and how in New Zealand
[35:06] is only a one lane highway most of the
[35:09] way and it's one lane that way in one
[35:10] lane that way right and you know you get
[35:13] you get a tractor you get something and
[35:15] you just stuck man and you can be stuck
[35:17] for a long time
[35:18] and if and and if you're in a believer's
[35:21] car you can't pass that truck very often
[35:23] because believers don't have fast cars
[35:25] is that right there we all have
[35:28] sanctified cars a big wagons yeah amen
[35:34] and so there's always going to be these
[35:37] obstacles on the highway you know on a
[35:41] little highway but you see when God came
[35:43] he didn't just create a one lane highway
[35:46] for our God but he created a double way
[35:50] seven main highway amen hallelujah for a
[35:53] divine seven seal connection amen
[35:58] traveling at the Skookum in the speed of
[36:01] light anyone tell me what's faster than
[36:03] the speed of light can anyone tell me
[36:06] what's faster than the speed of light
[36:08] Rebecca Wow amen
[36:11] we'll just say of course he is fought
[36:14] fought as faster than the speed of light
[36:17] amen and that's why once we get into our
[36:22] glorified condition back to where we
[36:24] should have been before Adam fell we
[36:26] will travel by thought hallelujah you
[36:29] know if you are light now there's a
[36:32] physicist in here I don't know if you
[36:33] learned that some sort of I won't i
[36:37] won't i won't frame him but let's just
[36:40] say that if you are light and you are
[36:42] traveling at that speed there is no such
[36:44] thing as space because you see when
[36:47] you're traveling at the speed of light
[36:48] and if you are light itself there is no
[36:52] space so you can you just are light does
[36:56] not see space or time Amen because Jesus
[37:00] says I am the light of the world and
[37:02] therefore I am that I am and before
[37:05] Abraham was I am Amen because he travels
[37:08] at the speed of light he is the light
[37:10] and he is an all time does not exist in
[37:13] his eyes even though he created
[37:16] he's not subject to it amen so we have a
[37:20] highway that's been made for our God
[37:22] there's a purpose that this Ministry of
[37:25] Elijah would come and to tie everything
[37:27] that was there that the intention of
[37:30] John the Baptist ministry was to that to
[37:34] tie it and win in 1930-something 33 or 6
[37:39] or 5 I don't know exactly what year it
[37:41] was but when brother Branham was
[37:43] baptizing the 17th person on the high
[37:45] river a voice the pillar of fire comes
[37:49] down and was seen by many any and and
[37:51] and and it said as john the baptist was
[37:55] sent to forerun the first coming of
[37:57] jesus christ I seen you with a message
[37:59] to foreign the second coming of Jesus
[38:02] Christ and so you see that the very the
[38:06] the very intent the very that the grace
[38:09] that was issued forth that was dispensed
[38:11] through the ministry would be dispensed
[38:13] through the Ministry of our Elijah and
[38:16] and what he would do as mate bring us to
[38:21] a climate where everything that has been
[38:23] promised everything that was been lost
[38:26] and everything that is inhibiting us
[38:29] that is stopping us that is restricting
[38:31] us and all the faults and all the
[38:32] barriers and officer and all the
[38:35] society's expectations and all the
[38:37] pressures and all of the the isms and
[38:40] ideologies and fears and all of these
[38:42] things that Satan has built up over the
[38:45] last hundreds of years would be broken
[38:48] down
[38:49] there would come a liberation and and
[38:53] anybody that's listening in this room
[38:56] right now can be free whatever is
[38:59] troubling you
[39:00] whatever is inhibiting you and the devil
[39:04] may be screaming in your mind right now
[39:05] don't listen to him listen to him
[39:08] you have your own life you do it your
[39:09] way you've got a better idea
[39:11] you know that Satan said that before the
[39:14] world ever began he thought he had a
[39:16] better idea he thought he could do a
[39:18] better thing than Michael he thought he
[39:20] could do a better society and he he had
[39:23] a pretty well ingenious idea but you see
[39:26] there is a way that seemeth right unto
[39:29] men but the end thereof is death and no
[39:32] matter how the devil can reason to you
[39:35] how good it may seem how good it may
[39:37] seem look at what Satan has created out
[39:40] here look at the civilization that is
[39:43] you see he's made this great thing and
[39:46] the Prophet said it's a Satan's Eden and
[39:49] it's a great world to sinan and he's
[39:52] made it and this he's not trying to as
[39:54] Isaac said last Sunday he doesn't want
[39:57] you to have a miserable life he wants
[39:59] you to enjoy this he wants it to work
[40:01] this is his best effort and look at it
[40:05] that's full of emptiness darkness fail I
[40:10] couldn't if I was if I was the teacher
[40:13] of all teachers and I'm and I got his
[40:16] assignment I would put if on me amen
[40:20] they gotta fail he failed his exam and
[40:24] all those angels that followed him and
[40:27] went down with them fail and they know
[40:30] it and that's why they're so mad that's
[40:32] why they're beating at the gate they
[40:34] want it they just want to be free to
[40:36] gone cause carnage and one day when when
[40:39] the bride leaves and the Holy Ghost
[40:41] lifts off but you the world has never
[40:44] seen anything so bad right now he's on a
[40:47] leash right now it's limited what he can
[40:49] do
[40:49] he's has to abide by things because the
[40:51] brides here and because God has to not
[40:54] finish yet but when this lives off all
[40:57] of that how all that hatred because he
[40:59] knows he's got an end he knows that he
[41:02] will one day
[41:02] cease to exist he knows that he and he
[41:05] knows that an e that must just
[41:07] completely great him and he knows he
[41:09] can't be redeemed and that's why he's
[41:11] doing everything he can to take you he
[41:14] wants to take you he wants to destroy
[41:16] you once he's finished with you he'll
[41:19] use you in many different ways if he can
[41:22] but God Richard mercy he sent us a
[41:25] message in this day and without this
[41:28] message oh my
[41:30] you would be swimming in darkness with
[41:32] you won't know that when from the trees
[41:35] I'm telling you this world is groping
[41:39] and darkness groping and darkness you
[41:42] know that song that the Lord gave us
[41:43] ages ago for the youth camp and it says
[41:46] everywhere I looked darkness was my
[41:49] light not anymore
[41:51] Amen but dark everywhere no matter if
[41:54] someone outside no matter who they are
[41:57] whether they are the most sincere
[41:59] Christian and they out they even have a
[42:02] spiritual experience with the law
[42:03] without this message everywhere they
[42:06] look as darkness they just have little
[42:08] bits of pockets of light that they see
[42:10] but they don't see what we see and it's
[42:14] God and simplicity it's God so simple so
[42:17] humble yet so powerful hallelujah let me
[42:23] just read here you know there's a quote
[42:30] that we're brother Brandon sees one day
[42:32] will realize realization has anyone ever
[42:35] heard that before
[42:37] that just you know my hallelujah the
[42:42] prophets the Apostles they all speak of
[42:45] a time where the people the redeemed
[42:47] will come to a fullness
[42:48] they'll come to that spot where the Lord
[42:52] just raptures them off the earth and
[42:54] says here in 1 Corinthians 2 verse 9 and
[42:57] 10 it says but at it as it is written
[42:59] eye has not seen nor ear heard neither
[43:04] have entered into the heart of man the
[43:07] things which God has prepared for them
[43:09] that love them but here's now we always
[43:13] put this off to the Future right
[43:16] yes there will be a full measure of it
[43:17] that we cannot even our hearts cannot
[43:20] even conceive but do not put your
[43:23] experience off into the future because
[43:26] the very god hallelujah
[43:29] the very mighty conqueror the second
[43:33] Adam has come down into your Jerusalem
[43:36] and he's come down into a war-torn
[43:39] religious miss Hart that's full of all
[43:44] sorts of cancerous color or all sorts of
[43:47] parasites all sorts of ideologies and
[43:49] craziness and he comes down and he says
[43:52] I'm going to turn that back into a need
[43:53] in at condition again I'm gonna give you
[43:55] peace I'm gonna bring it all back to the
[43:58] way it should be
[43:58] amen so if that God promised to do that
[44:07] inside you shouldn't you just say Here I
[44:10] am Lord who says that as if I come to
[44:14] that place where you realize that the
[44:16] very creator the creator of heavens and
[44:20] earth has promised to turn your heart
[44:22] which has been war-torn back into
[44:25] Jerusalem back into an eternity
[44:26] condition and all you can do you go Lord
[44:29] Here I am Here I am Lord I'm and you
[44:35] know you see now because I want I don't
[44:36] just want to bring a whole bunch of
[44:38] facts to you but I want to show you
[44:40] prophetically or where we are right now
[44:44] because you see when you know where you
[44:46] are right now you can take positive
[44:49] advantage of the grace that is being
[44:52] poured out in the moment that you're
[44:53] living in because the Lord does specific
[44:56] things when the cloud stopped they he he
[44:59] revealed a few things to the people and
[45:01] he gave Commandments with us in there
[45:03] and then he moved on and then he did
[45:05] some more specific things and then he
[45:07] stopped and then he moved on and he
[45:09] revealed more so if we're walking with
[45:11] the pillar of fire then daily monthly
[45:14] yearly as a local version as local bride
[45:18] as the bride international because you
[45:20] see what's being ministered in the
[45:22] spirit that's very similar all over
[45:24] because it's the same spirit inspiring
[45:26] and yet the balance of the
[45:29] ministry will sway like this depending
[45:31] on what spirits are taking the church ma
[45:35] so that's why it's so important that you
[45:37] engaged in the local ministry that
[45:40] there's been given to you
[45:41] amen it's very important because the
[45:44] Lord is keeping the balance but yet the
[45:47] subjects the the climate the very divine
[45:51] expression it's very similar what he's
[45:55] doing we are in a climate of love
[45:58] hallelujah I just read I read a
[46:03] scripture to you that you all know very
[46:05] well we all know that scripture I have
[46:08] not seen nor has he heard everyone knows
[46:10] the scripture right
[46:11] it's a favorite it's it's a scripture
[46:13] that we can all say wow this is so
[46:16] amazing
[46:16] but sometimes we forget to read the next
[46:19] verse and the next verse is this but God
[46:23] I like it when it sees about God who
[46:25] likes it when it sees about God oh my oh
[46:28] my my we can just really go there has
[46:33] revealed them what what is he revealed
[46:38] the things that God has prepared for
[46:43] them that love him these great things
[46:45] right but God has revealed them unto us
[46:48] by a spirit so you see as as the word
[46:58] goes forth little by little God just
[47:01] starts to reveal to you these things now
[47:04] when when you can get caught up in the
[47:07] very thought of it did you know that the
[47:10] fort of the word you know anyone can
[47:13] just say a bunch of words you know
[47:15] anyone can just preach a bunch of words
[47:17] but anyone can read the Bible but what's
[47:23] the thought behind it what's the emotion
[47:25] behind it what does God feel about this
[47:28] word what is the very essence the heart
[47:32] of the matter
[47:33] and now as you see a minister can get
[47:37] caught up in their rule and there's
[47:39] people you can tell you can tell how
[47:42] impacted some people were getting when a
[47:45] certain word goes forth and it strikes
[47:47] their minutes in season and they say how
[47:49] good is it oh my and this is enough is
[47:54] it that the heart of God is expressed
[47:58] and that person gets caught up in the
[48:02] moment and it can be the most simple
[48:04] thing and yet there's like that
[48:07] predestined seed inside you it just just
[48:11] just stirs up and it reaches out and the
[48:14] leaves come open and the light and the
[48:17] rain causes life to come forth so you
[48:25] see this future home this heavenly home
[48:30] we are hearing front we are hearing from
[48:34] our theophanies we are hearing from our
[48:37] heavenly home we are hearing from our
[48:40] new jerusalem hallelujah like a city
[48:44] coming down hallelujah amen hallelujah
[48:50] there's more to preaching them sometimes
[48:52] we realize and if you can just sit there
[48:56] and say wherever you're at if you can
[49:00] sit there and just say lord help me to
[49:02] believe that just these are warfare
[49:07] going on right now there's a warfare
[49:10] happening right now in this place right
[49:13] here and the devil does not want you to
[49:16] be impacted by the word he wants to keep
[49:18] you on a he wants you to learn he
[49:20] doesn't mind you learning the word
[49:21] learning all the mysteries learning all
[49:23] about the message learning at what's
[49:25] happening learning that we're in a
[49:27] climate of love but he doesn't want you
[49:29] to experience the climate of love but
[49:31] you can experience the climate of love
[49:34] open your heart right now and just say
[49:37] Lord let me experience the climate of
[49:41] love because in that climate of love
[49:44] there is no fear and when there's no
[49:47] fear there is faith and you can believe
[49:50] all the word and you have a snowball
[49:53] glory effect
[49:55] can I explain the snowball glory effect
[49:58] you start rolling Amen you start rolling
[50:02] and it just gets better and better and
[50:03] better because you're in the cycle of
[50:05] eternity
[50:06] it's an eternal cycle but you gotta
[50:09] break out of this cultural limitations
[50:11] gotta break out of all of the ideas in
[50:14] your head
[50:15] gotta break out of the lies that Satan's
[50:17] telling you right now that you can't
[50:19] believe it because you don't have faith
[50:20] you have faced every man is given a
[50:23] measure of faith every man all of you
[50:27] has a measure because you are a son or
[50:29] daughter of God
[50:31] default don't even limit yourself
[50:34] hallelujah the devil's very busy always
[50:38] trying to make you feel like you don't
[50:40] believe in you can't believe you here I
[50:41] have faith because you've seen too much
[50:43] of this and then what it's all rubbish
[50:44] it's just a liar let faith rise in your
[50:48] heart believe the word and experience
[50:51] the climate of love back rounding so
[51:00] this line here when the mountains and
[51:03] valleys join in perfect love you know
[51:06] when the ballot mallet when the
[51:07] mountains and valleys join it creates a
[51:10] plane right it creates an area where the
[51:14] devil cannot hide for those that you
[51:16] weren't here last time I like it when
[51:19] the devil can hide and he just gets guns
[51:22] on him and he gets punched and he gets
[51:23] kick hallelujah he gets a beating until
[51:28] he leaves the leaves all hallelujah amen
[51:32] put yourself on the operating table and
[51:34] let him meet God just let God bring your
[51:40] life up to a point now he brings the
[51:43] local church up to that right he removes
[51:46] criticisms he removes all of these
[51:47] spirits that would cause pride and
[51:51] inferiorities and and and people down in
[51:54] the dumps and the deepest valleys within
[51:57] it where it's just so bad these
[51:58] depressions and all of these things this
[52:01] is what the devil wants but the Lord
[52:03] seem to like
[52:04] the Lord sent us a message hallelujah
[52:06] sent us a message now in that message is
[52:09] power hallelujah to raise the valley
[52:14] floor to take down all the pride and
[52:16] take down the big man the big names all
[52:20] of that stuff means nothing
[52:23] hallelujah and to remove all the
[52:27] fanaticism on the top tip of the
[52:29] mountain and take away all the legalism
[52:31] at the bottom of the valley and bring it
[52:33] into a place where it's any dinner
[52:35] conditions flat why because there has to
[52:38] be a battle of Armageddon in your life
[52:43] hallelujah he wants to do that for you
[52:48] he wants to make it plain the ego
[52:51] children I gave you contextual pictures
[52:54] [Laughter]
[52:57] he wants to make your life like that you
[53:01] see now he's doing it for our church
[53:03] here I can't speak for other churches
[53:05] I'm not part of them but I'm sure he's
[53:07] doing anything here but he's bringing
[53:09] the local vision into a place where the
[53:12] devil cannot heavy nice way hallelujah
[53:14] and you're so glad and you're so glad
[53:18] Laurie because his day is finished now
[53:23] because the bride can discern the
[53:25] Antichrist spirit now why because
[53:27] someone got given a sword in their hand
[53:30] hallelujah we have a prophet amen the
[53:33] first redeemed son to come to maturity
[53:35] whoa and he received a plummet in his
[53:39] hand
[53:39] Amen do you know what a plummet is who
[53:41] knows what a plummet is hallelujah Amen
[53:45] let's go that's a plummet this is
[53:48] old-school now we don't use these
[53:49] anymore we use lasers amen so you can
[53:52] think if you want to anyone know the
[53:54] Sermon the countdown with the Prophet
[53:57] types technology worth with the
[54:01] advancement of the bride's experience
[54:03] and what as the Lord gives revelation to
[54:06] the bride and and unlocks the mysteries
[54:08] of his will and gives her the power to
[54:11] become body and then if she starts to
[54:14] advance in the word and become more like
[54:15] him then the technology also follow
[54:18] suit now so so you can see this plummet
[54:21] that has what they do with this plummet
[54:23] as as it helps them to make it straight
[54:27] and true and square and they and they
[54:30] use them in the old days now we have
[54:32] lasers right amen
[54:34] so here is this plummet and it's been
[54:36] placed in the hands of a prophet
[54:39] hallelujah
[54:40] what that plummet is is the sword of the
[54:42] king amen
[54:43] finally after 2,000 years of of all
[54:47] sorts of listen bad and maybe this and
[54:49] maybe there and all of those things and
[54:51] questions all over and the accuser of
[54:53] the Brethren could not fully be cast
[54:55] down he was still accusing see they
[54:59] believe that you're a three-person
[55:00] Trinity they believe in this bunny
[55:02] baptism I managed to put into their
[55:04] midst to take away the power of the name
[55:06] of Jesus but and then all of a sudden he
[55:09] was silenced hallelujah all of a sudden
[55:12] I plummet landed in the hands of the
[55:14] Prophet amen what to do to to kick the
[55:17] devil out of your experience to give her
[55:20] out of your life this message has come
[55:22] to completely remove Satan out of your
[55:24] life completely remove all ideologies
[55:27] all all national spirits why because a
[55:30] sort landed in a prophet an amen
[55:33] Noah lujah I'll go back to that later
[55:41] so you see here comes us now I'm not I
[55:48] don't you know the foundation of this
[55:51] and the mechanics you know as Zod right
[55:56] the correct order and doctrine and all
[55:58] those things but it's far higher than it
[56:01] it's grown far greater that's just the
[56:05] foundation it's just the building blocks
[56:07] you know the ABCs here's the ABCs how
[56:11] you should carry yourself you see if
[56:14] that's just on the outside and it's just
[56:16] been lived out because you see that it's
[56:18] the right thing to do and then their
[56:20] very heart of God's love and grace has
[56:23] not pitched it inside yet but there is a
[56:27] power in this room
[56:28] there's a Holy Ghost for you there's a
[56:31] Holy Ghost for you right now in this
[56:34] place that can take and itch the very
[56:37] heart and character a nature of God
[56:39] inside you and to your heart right the
[56:43] law on the fleshy tables of your heart
[56:45] so this word would go forth and there
[56:48] would be now at for the last 50 years
[56:52] since the book came open and and the
[56:54] fullness of the word has been manifested
[56:56] you know this word has been going false
[56:58] but there's been so much limitations so
[57:01] much of the man age still and the people
[57:03] so much of the man age still in the
[57:05] ministry the ministry preaches doctrine
[57:08] in the Eagle age but administers the
[57:10] message in the man age many times many
[57:13] times the administration of the message
[57:16] to what the leadership has just been a
[57:18] repeat of how they were raised in their
[57:19] churches how they were raised by their
[57:21] parents and then it gets enforced on the
[57:23] people by a law and by a hard mentality
[57:26] because that's how it used to be done
[57:28] that's how it wasn't the manager there's
[57:30] how it wasn't the Victorian age but this
[57:33] higher way you see love creates an
[57:38] atmosphere with sovereign grace can
[57:40] manifest in its full measure and so love
[57:46] as a person who comes down now you can't
[57:51] come down when the atmosphere is wrong
[57:54] conception can't take place and critical
[57:57] conditions conception cannot take place
[58:03] with someone is so pressured to perform
[58:13] Oh Lord make meanness oh I just got to
[58:16] do this and they try and they try like a
[58:20] couple that's longed to have children
[58:22] and maybe they do yes a few years they
[58:27] want to establish their life this is
[58:30] just hypothetical not talking about
[58:31] anyone in particular but they want to
[58:33] establish their life so they spend five
[58:36] years and they build their life and they
[58:37] get their home and then they try and get
[58:39] two babies right have a baby and maybe
[58:43] they try for a year and then all of a
[58:44] sudden fear comes all of a sudden is
[58:47] they're worried all of a sudden they get
[58:49] tense
[58:50] all of a sudden love can not the climate
[58:53] of love gets overtaken by fear overtaken
[58:59] by pressure overtaken by and it becomes
[59:05] a the Prophet said if you want to
[59:08] conceive you just need to go and adopt a
[59:10] baby right and then just relax and then
[59:15] when you relax many times that people
[59:17] can have babies because they've relaxed
[59:19] again they've fell in love with this
[59:21] baby that they adopted and then and then
[59:24] they can have babies again now that now
[59:26] they've relaxed now there's a climate of
[59:28] love and this is the climate that we're
[59:31] in now amen and so the administration
[59:34] the way it is administered the wires
[59:37] expressed the way that it is led has to
[59:40] follow the climate of love and perfect
[59:44] balance to allow the Spirit of God to
[59:48] conceive in the people's hearts so the
[59:51] people can take their critical stickers
[59:53] that are poking that people are looking
[59:54] everywhere and critical and turn them
[59:57] back into live so that that person can
[59:59] actually get born again that person can
[1:00:01] actually have love in their life that
[1:00:03] person can become gracious because now
[1:00:06] these leaves because the leaf that stuck
[1:00:08] up and others by cannot photosynthesize
[1:00:11] but when it rolls out and the water
[1:00:13] comes down and the sunshine or my great
[1:00:16] things can happen there is the climate
[1:00:18] that we are in so God has revealed these
[1:00:22] things to us
[1:00:23] he is revealing he is giving you a
[1:00:26] glimpse of your heavenly home
[1:00:27] hey man hallelujah the rapture is a
[1:00:31] cycle what's happening now we're in it
[1:00:33] if you're not in it get in it now there
[1:00:36] is no excuse there is no reason to not
[1:00:40] be in this rapture for you personally
[1:00:45] now it's time this is your hour this is
[1:00:48] your moment to come into a climate of
[1:00:50] love because you're made for it this is
[1:00:52] what you're made for we're made for this
[1:00:53] we're made this is the very heart of God
[1:00:57] that he's been waiting for he's been
[1:01:00] waiting for this time for many years
[1:01:03] this is like one of the delights of
[1:01:05] God's heart that's happening right now
[1:01:08] and you happen to be part of it you have
[1:01:12] to be part of the greatest love story as
[1:01:14] its manifesting in the flesh hallelujah
[1:01:18] you know all that he's desired and all
[1:01:21] the types and everything that all these
[1:01:23] thousands of lives
[1:01:25] all the stars all the chromosomes and
[1:01:28] all of the everything has all as all
[1:01:32] pointing towards the very experience
[1:01:34] that you have been privileged and you
[1:01:37] want to hold back here's a divine
[1:01:41] expression of love now when you receive
[1:01:47] that expression when all of the glass
[1:01:54] has cleared away because of the largest
[1:01:58] ministry when all the mountains and
[1:02:01] valleys in your life have been made
[1:02:02] plain and the devil's exposed and he
[1:02:04] can't find a place to hide in you then
[1:02:08] you become a reflector and you and it
[1:02:11] goes he shines and he expresses now the
[1:02:16] reflector don't think of it as a mirror
[1:02:18] think of it as a divine attribute
[1:02:25] because you see the divine attribute in
[1:02:27] your life when the word comes and it's
[1:02:30] full pal which are does happening right
[1:02:31] now the divine attribute justice it
[1:02:34] comes back and it meets and it twists
[1:02:37] together
[1:02:38] double helix like like the DNA strand it
[1:02:42] comes together and that that that that's
[1:02:46] that's really like coming into communion
[1:02:48] with the Lord because your your
[1:02:50] predestined seed and has divine
[1:02:52] expression is it's becoming married it's
[1:02:55] becoming unified on those tapes now I'm
[1:03:02] just gonna this just this is mechanical
[1:03:04] now those tapes now have power and them
[1:03:09] to bring you to that condition don't
[1:03:12] limit what's happened what can happen on
[1:03:14] those tapes if you're you might be in a
[1:03:17] critical condition right now spiritually
[1:03:19] and you're struggling let me share a
[1:03:22] testimony I went out when I ran away
[1:03:29] from the Lord I ran away from the Lord
[1:03:32] for about a year 12 years ago and I got
[1:03:38] so caught up in everything that the
[1:03:40] world could evil all that stuff right
[1:03:43] and I got so spiritually drained out I
[1:03:49] could not live a life of a Christian
[1:03:52] right I couldn't even think of calling
[1:03:54] on the name of the Lord
[1:03:55] it was just like man how could I do I
[1:03:56] knew it was wrong I knew it was right to
[1:03:59] do that and I knew that what he could do
[1:04:01] but I just couldn't do it because I was
[1:04:02] so spiritually in it and weak yeah and
[1:04:06] so you know what the Lord reminded me of
[1:04:09] this this this remember the the Chiefs
[1:04:13] that talked to brother Branham and
[1:04:15] brother Branham interviewed the chief
[1:04:16] and brother Brennan says house chief
[1:04:19] going and chief says chief is going good
[1:04:22] and he goes but but then the chief says
[1:04:25] but it depends on which dog the chief
[1:04:28] feeds the most because if he feeds that
[1:04:31] a few feet the black dog you're gonna
[1:04:34] get weaker and weaker and weaker and
[1:04:36] weaker and the white dog you know the
[1:04:37] white dog inside you their God part it
[1:04:40] just becomes just it's becomes dormant
[1:04:42] and their flesh
[1:04:44] you struggle with thoughts and all that
[1:04:47] because you've gone beyond the barrier
[1:04:49] of the word you've gone out of the
[1:04:51] protection of God and you're out there
[1:04:54] on your own on your own in a wilderness
[1:04:57] and your free game and this prayers come
[1:05:01] and to hide you and protect you and how
[1:05:03] the Saints are pray to keep you know if
[1:05:07] you only knew know for me I was in that
[1:05:12] placement I ended up like the prodigal
[1:05:15] son rejected from darkness my I got down
[1:05:19] to the lowest place you could ever get
[1:05:21] apart from not as low as how the Lord
[1:05:23] went because he was the one that came to
[1:05:25] homeless the greatest became them the
[1:05:28] lowest think of that the greatest became
[1:05:32] the last when I got close to that rock
[1:05:35] rock bottom beyond below rock bottom
[1:05:38] rejected from society rejected and then
[1:05:42] the Lord spoke if you feed the white dog
[1:05:46] you'll get strength again so I started
[1:05:49] playing the message I had the message so
[1:05:52] I just played the tapes now at first I
[1:05:54] couldn't even listen to it I had to play
[1:05:56] it below audible you know I happen
[1:05:58] things started changing
[1:06:02] hallelujah I experienced isaiah 43:2 5
[1:06:08] my life stud a highway started being
[1:06:11] formed the mountains started coming down
[1:06:13] the valley started coming up amen the
[1:06:15] pile started becoming straight
[1:06:17] hallelujah
[1:06:19] I did nothing like a right hallelujah
[1:06:22] she had a message too she had a mighty
[1:06:25] angel as well
[1:06:26] he came down with a sword too we hid my
[1:06:29] mother an open book come down stand on
[1:06:30] the sea in the earth she had one that
[1:06:31] came down on the land to take the people
[1:06:33] into there she didn't do nothing other
[1:06:36] than believe and she stood she stood
[1:06:40] there under the world hallelujah the
[1:06:44] captain released the mystery that would
[1:06:46] redeem her the captain released the
[1:06:48] mystery and there was a praying people a
[1:06:51] vision based people who took the measure
[1:06:55] got there by the angel and acted upon it
[1:06:58] don't just hear what I'm saying do it I
[1:07:04] just think it's good to listen to tapes
[1:07:07] listen to them cuz that's the voice of
[1:07:10] the mighty angel it's the voice that I
[1:07:12] kept if you mix it with faith that's
[1:07:15] just the voice of a Kentuckian if you
[1:07:16] just listen to it intellectually you can
[1:07:19] learn all the Kentucky and was
[1:07:21] privileged to speak and this as far as
[1:07:24] but if you've got faith if you're
[1:07:27] believing a man that's the voice of the
[1:07:33] mighty angel that's the voice behind the
[1:07:36] voice amen Rahab stood there and he come
[1:07:41] the grace just crumbled her whole past
[1:07:44] everything started what did he do took
[1:07:47] all the man-made structure out all of
[1:07:50] the lies all of the haters all of those
[1:07:52] that were against all of her accusers
[1:07:54] was destroyed amen
[1:07:56] she didn't go there and smash the wall
[1:08:01] she just listened to the tapes
[1:08:04] however yeah she listened and she became
[1:08:08] subject to the anointing of the mighty
[1:08:11] angel the anointing of the captain
[1:08:14] who would come down into her life so
[1:08:18] that she would be fit to marry the
[1:08:19] captain of the army whoa hey men friend
[1:08:23] I tell you she did nothing to deserve it
[1:08:27] and nothing to make it happen
[1:08:30] apart from act upon the word that she
[1:08:32] believed she just acted upon it she
[1:08:36] looked out a prophecy of you
[1:08:37] hey man it's not how much you can
[1:08:40] perform and all these things it's
[1:08:42] believed and what stand still stand
[1:08:46] still and see the salvation of God so I
[1:08:50] listen to these tapes and all of these
[1:08:52] things the white dog started getting
[1:08:54] stronger and stronger and stronger the
[1:08:55] volume started getting higher and higher
[1:08:57] and higher and I started to enjoy it
[1:08:59] then one day one day hallelujah when the
[1:09:03] when the path the construction site was
[1:09:05] getting to a certain point now where you
[1:09:07] could start to see the appearing of the
[1:09:10] building came in and in things are
[1:09:12] starting to take shape I didn't do
[1:09:14] anything else to do like Rahab
[1:09:16] hallelujah listening believing knowing I
[1:09:20] was in a critical condition and you may
[1:09:22] be in a critical condition
[1:09:23] and YouTube is so tantalizing and all of
[1:09:26] these evils it's so hard to stop but
[1:09:30] tonight I can just encourage you put a
[1:09:34] tape on just put the voice on and say
[1:09:37] Lord I want to feed the white dog now I
[1:09:40] can tell you now more than a month
[1:09:43] things will start changing man I will
[1:09:48] make a highway for our God and we're
[1:09:50] gonna within a few months you there will
[1:09:52] be a highway in your life and your
[1:09:53] engagement with the Lord and your
[1:09:55] relationship with the Lord will be a
[1:09:56] climate of love a climate of love where
[1:10:01] you can conceive where you can have
[1:10:03] peace where you can have joy where you
[1:10:05] can respond to this word appropriately
[1:10:10] without any areas I ever gonna get to my
[1:10:16] fall here
[1:10:24] and reject the king the Prophet sees
[1:10:26] this that I finished that thought I did
[1:10:31] a I'll just see it one more thing I just
[1:10:34] was reminded I have to share this
[1:10:36] because so you know when it got to a
[1:10:39] certain point now now I have now I now I
[1:10:43] you know this was like a process here
[1:10:45] because you know you don't realize how
[1:10:46] bad it was how far I'd gone real far and
[1:10:51] I'm not going to go into the details I
[1:10:52] want to glorify the devil but and now
[1:10:55] you know instead of like evil satanic
[1:10:58] music playing in my ears all night I hit
[1:11:00] the message plain can you think that
[1:11:02] right this is a contrast now that black
[1:11:05] dog was not happy and there was a Bible
[1:11:08] sitting in my dresser in my bedside
[1:11:10] table and that Bible dare I say it was
[1:11:13] covered in dust dust hadn't touched it
[1:11:16] but I used to look at it you know I knew
[1:11:19] I should be reading them I should be
[1:11:21] reading that and there might be some
[1:11:22] dusty Bibles in here tonight hey man
[1:11:25] just put one foot in front of the other
[1:11:29] just one verse even the Lord just wants
[1:11:33] something to work with give them
[1:11:34] something to work with
[1:11:37] and I just felt like I should read this
[1:11:39] thing I'm gonna read it so I picked it
[1:11:43] up and I just open what's happening here
[1:11:45] I picked this Bible up and I and I
[1:11:48] opened the Bible and you know what open
[1:11:52] to it open to this is the Lord it opened
[1:11:57] to touch not the unclean thing and I
[1:12:00] will receive do you know how powerful
[1:12:04] that was for me because I was still
[1:12:06] dabbling it I was still dabbling I was
[1:12:10] still doing things that I shouldn't be
[1:12:11] doing taking things I shouldn't take and
[1:12:15] I had I had written an exegesis of
[1:12:20] Revelation beforehand so you can see I
[1:12:23] was already I was well on my way to
[1:12:25] walking as a Christian but I was well on
[1:12:27] my way to becoming a critical dogmatic
[1:12:30] unbelieving believer
[1:12:34] but I had to go down to the bottom of
[1:12:37] the bottom and realize that I'm nothing
[1:12:39] hallelujah so that God could pick up the
[1:12:43] broken pieces and he says that's not the
[1:12:47] unclean thing and I will receive you and
[1:12:48] this revelation came to me I've tried
[1:12:51] I've received the Lord year ago I was on
[1:12:55] fire I was going around the prisons and
[1:12:57] I was telling everyone in there I was
[1:13:00] fighting all the Jehovah Witnesses
[1:13:02] fighting the Catholics fighting the
[1:13:04] Mormons telling them how wrong they were
[1:13:06] because I had the message the message of
[1:13:09] the hour and I'm not putting that down
[1:13:12] because this is the greatest thing for
[1:13:13] us but I had the wrong attitude motive
[1:13:17] because I received do you know why I
[1:13:21] hadn't been received
[1:13:22] there was one reason why I hadn't been
[1:13:24] received because I reserved 1% of my
[1:13:29] agenda just 1% now I'm not a
[1:13:32] mathematician but let's just say 1%
[1:13:34] cause it sounds dramatic I reserved 1% I
[1:13:40] reserved something I don't know what
[1:13:42] pasina's but I reserved something it was
[1:13:44] one thing I held on to and it was my
[1:13:47] life you know it's very subtle right
[1:13:50] it's very subtle
[1:13:52] the Lord knows when you lose your
[1:13:55] reservation he knows when you just say
[1:13:57] it's like you're all tense and you're
[1:14:00] about to go through the sound barrier
[1:14:01] let's shake it and all of a sudden you
[1:14:04] let go of that 1% good and you're smooth
[1:14:09] you've broken through there's a glory
[1:14:12] that never fails in this place you're in
[1:14:15] the Shekinah you were a stick shaped by
[1:14:18] man use for tax rate on everybody you
[1:14:22] turn back into your origin
[1:14:25] why who broke through why cuz let go of
[1:14:32] that elem forfeits their rights all of
[1:14:37] them and I held on to one thing and
[1:14:41] there was a moment in the end I was
[1:14:42] reading the scripture as he touch not
[1:14:44] the unclean thing and I will receive you
[1:14:46] and I said lord I don't want to be
[1:14:48] received I want this and I knew I hadn't
[1:14:52] been received you know I heard the
[1:14:54] prophets say it's one thing for us to
[1:14:56] believe in God and it's another thing
[1:14:59] for him to come and see us to receive
[1:15:01] her faith and I thought oh Jesus
[1:15:05] oh my it was about two weeks after that
[1:15:09] where that one person little piece of
[1:15:12] sand was given over and you know what he
[1:15:15] did let me just share something with you
[1:15:17] he took that send Amen they elect piece
[1:15:21] of sand like he said to Abraham look at
[1:15:23] the sand of the stars and he took this
[1:15:24] and he placed it in the heavens
[1:15:27] hallelujah from this sand to the Stars
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:33] so the devil could stop using me to
[1:15:35] build his society and then take the sand
[1:15:39] that they used to build and build a
[1:15:40] great Babylon place me back to build the
[1:15:46] New Jerusalem that's what he wants to
[1:15:49] build out of your life he doesn't want
[1:15:50] you to build now there's nothing wrong
[1:15:52] with working nothing wrong you have to
[1:15:53] do it one day you won't be able to make
[1:15:56] the most of it now but one day when you
[1:15:58] get lose that privilege what will happen

[1:16:32] daughters of God let go of yourself let
[1:16:36] go of your inhibitions
[1:16:39] let go of your education now I'm not
[1:16:43] saying that you shouldn't educate or

[1:16:50] use it don't you use a stop using it all
[1:16:53] yourself God you'll be surprised what he
[1:17:00] lets you have you'll be surprised that

[1:18:32] do that he's not worried about those
[1:18:35] he's not worried about you having this
[1:18:37] big memory challenge to remember
[1:18:39] everything it's not that all the
[1:18:42] information I've got a repeater versus
[1:18:43] repeater there no it's one simple
[1:18:46] surrender you knows the moment that you
[1:18:51] just let go he knows it and everything
[1:18:55] changes everything changed when he came
[1:18:58] amen bye-bye the Prophet sees us and the
[1:19:07] rejected King and I heard a voice then
[1:19:10] that spake unto me now he's up in heaven
[1:19:12] right he's he's having his heavenly
[1:19:14] experience right now who knows the
[1:19:17] Prophet got taken up into heaven does
[1:19:19] everyone know that right you know the
[1:19:21] story oh that's very impacting so he's
[1:19:24] up there and this is and I heard a voice
[1:19:26] then let spoke to me that was in the
[1:19:29] room so this is the Lord you know the
[1:19:31] angel of the Lord that was with him said
[1:19:33] this is what you preached when I heard
[1:19:37] that I thought of glory I'm so glad that
[1:19:39] that great presence and that great
[1:19:41] atmosphere and the thing that he
[1:19:43] couldn't even have human words to
[1:19:44] describe was the very thing that he
[1:19:47] preached I thought wow this could come
[1:19:49] out of a prophets math this creative
[1:19:51] power this glory this atmosphere so if I
[1:19:54] could listen to these tapes I could
[1:19:56] experience a climate of love I could
[1:19:59] experience I could experience that and I
[1:20:03] really can you really experience that
[1:20:05] yes but these things that Barkat in your
[1:20:10] life is mental barriers these
[1:20:13] depressions there's false message
[1:20:16] cultures there's pressures there's
[1:20:19] tensions
[1:20:20] there's depressions there's evil spirits
[1:20:24] that you will Helen because of music and
[1:20:26] because of anger
[1:20:28] and the devil knows our weaknesses and
[1:20:30] he uses them and it brings you to church
[1:20:33] and you follow these things and troubles
[1:20:35] and woes and by the time you leave
[1:20:37] you're just back to zero like he wants
[1:20:40] you to come in here zero or here oh he
[1:20:43] wants you to come and go further he
[1:20:47] doesn't want you just to get
[1:20:48] recalibrated back to normal again amen
[1:20:51] you are made to live above those things
[1:20:53] you're made to live in your privilege
[1:20:56] you are made to live above the devil and
[1:21:00] all his antics and if you want the
[1:21:04] climate of love that is being ministered
[1:21:05] to fully affect your life take out of
[1:21:09] your heart and set your heart upon by
[1:21:12] God
[1:21:13] set your heart upon by God now we hear
[1:21:15] that a lot right he the Lord says that
[1:21:18] in almost every interpretation in the
[1:21:20] message sit by heart upon me and commit
[1:21:24] all my ways to me and guard your heart
[1:21:27] you are responsible o men for though for
[1:21:31] what you allow into your heart for what
[1:21:33] you allow into your life what you are
[1:21:35] Alan to your families and the things
[1:21:38] that art of the Lord are there to rep
[1:21:42] the experience of God out of your family
[1:21:44] out of your life out of your home cuz
[1:21:47] filled with the tree of knowledge and
[1:21:49] filled all the busyness he wants you to
[1:22:03] build Babylon but God wants to build a
[1:22:06] new Jerusalem out of here I want you to
[1:22:08] build he says sit your affections on
[1:22:11] things above not on things that are safe
[1:22:14] you know I was just reading this article
[1:22:20] they say that you know when you learn
[1:22:23] something at the start you're thinking
[1:22:25] about it you're wondering how you got to
[1:22:27] think about every process of a skill but
[1:22:30] in one day after you've done it so much
[1:22:32] it becomes autonomous right and the
[1:22:34] older you get the longer it takes
[1:22:36] children can pick up at a complex skill
[1:22:38] within days hours
[1:22:41] because their mind is geared and wired
[1:22:43] differently but an adult this
[1:22:46] subconscious takes a long time but
[1:22:48] they've found in studies that if someone
[1:22:51] has a passion for something hard if
[1:22:57] you've got a passion for something it
[1:22:59] gets ingrained inside you real quick so
[1:23:04] it's time to get a passion about this
[1:23:05] message it's time to be passionate about
[1:23:08] the law hallelujah but if your
[1:23:12] affections are sitting on other things
[1:23:13] and you're passionate about those then
[1:23:16] when you hear preaching yes it's good
[1:23:19] and you agree and it's all right and you
[1:23:23] get a little bit out of a service you
[1:23:25] get one take home fort and okay and you
[1:23:28] look at those others and they're like I
[1:23:32] know what's happening why aren't why am
[1:23:34] I not like where's your affection
[1:23:37] where's your passion because somehow the
[1:23:42] Lord's designed us that when your
[1:23:43] passion isn't something and you're
[1:23:45] passionate about it it's like an open
[1:23:48] highway for the Lord to turn your heart
[1:23:53] back to the message of the Apostles
[1:23:55] which is the person of Jesus Christ
[1:23:57] which is perfect love which is the very
[1:23:59] angel that comes down
[1:24:00] hallelujah an open book and he says come
[1:24:03] and eat it do you want some sustenance
[1:24:06] I'll give you sustenance they write real
[1:24:10] sustenance amen
[1:24:14] thanks give milk it opens when you
[1:24:21] really passionate about something it's
[1:24:23] like it opens all the channels and in
[1:24:26] whatever you're listening to or enjoying
[1:24:28] or about and oh my you can learn that
[1:24:31] real quick let's open something to you
[1:24:33] what do you open what do you want me to
[1:24:37] the Lord says take out of your heart
[1:24:40] take care of your heart oh man
[1:24:45] set your heart upon your God Who am I so
[1:24:50] this is the hour this is the hour where
[1:24:53] it all is being manifested this is the
[1:24:55] our way to find love as being manifested
[1:24:58] where the capstone is descending and
[1:25:02] attention is getting drawn to all these
[1:25:05] things you know I'm thinking of that
[1:25:07] brother that sees all brother branham is
[1:25:09] he gonna be pig hunting and heaven oh
[1:25:12] and he says brother I don't even know
[1:25:15] what he said I can't remember but mate

[1:25:23] imagine being a pig in a pig pen all
[1:25:26] your life and all of a sudden you get
[1:25:28] then you become a man and you remember
[1:25:30] what it was like to be a pig

[1:25:45] your future what it's gonna be the
[1:25:48] things that we'll have will give us joy
[1:25:50] go beyond anything we could ever imagine
[1:25:52] any but just think of this be passionate
[1:25:57] know about this message and if you're
[1:26:02] not us say Lord what is stopping me from
[1:26:05] being passionate about this marriage

[1:27:16] experience in the word I'm so glad for

[1:28:06] and tricks and the King's wrath came

[1:29:30] seventh seal seventh dimension
[1:29:33] experience and this message has come to
[1:29:37] minister an entrance into that Kingdom
[1:29:39] it says that an entrance shall be
[1:29:41] ministered unto you into the everlasting
[1:29:44] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:29:46] Christ minister now I encourage you go
[1:29:53] home and pray and say Lord I want to be
[1:29:57] under the full effect of it I want to be
[1:29:59] impacted by it
[1:30:00] I want to realize realization I want to
[1:30:04] know about to experience or to feel and
[1:30:06] I wants to see it I want it to be all
[1:30:08] over me and it's keeping me alive and I
[1:30:11] don't just want all over me I want by oh
[1:30:14] shut up in rebel hallelujah
[1:30:22] I'm about to close well I got two quotes
[1:30:28] down
[1:30:29] how am I you know you just yield to the
[1:30:33] Lord and let him speak we have all of
[1:30:37] our own ideas and sometimes you get so
[1:30:39] nervous and you just lay it all and say
[1:30:42] Lord you know he the Lord I believe that
[1:30:45] every service the Lord has a burden
[1:30:48] burden on his heart
[1:30:50] he wants to speak to his bride and so he
[1:30:54] just someone can just yield he's able to
[1:30:57] speak are you with me on that that
[1:31:03] thought
[1:31:04] there's an expression but this that but
[1:31:08] we have to be we've got to realize are
[1:31:10] we the Prophet asked this question and
[1:31:12] the church age books are we sufficiently
[1:31:15] impressed by the message and emerged and
[1:31:20] we sufficiently impressed not just how
[1:31:23] we impressed because we are impressed
[1:31:24] right it's impressive the Lord is
[1:31:27] impressive we we stay here we're
[1:31:29] enjoying that right but as it's
[1:31:31] sufficient is there anything that is
[1:31:34] limiting is there anything that is
[1:31:37] limiting our impression because you see
[1:31:43] you take the image of a signet right and
[1:31:46] here's a firebrand and that's the image
[1:31:49] of that life of God and it's not just a
[1:31:54] it's not just a affect or that's it's an
[1:31:59] inelastic life so that's the power of an
[1:32:02] in this life the prophecy when they hold
[1:32:05] the window when the pillar of fire came
[1:32:07] and he said it was like it was just a
[1:32:12] formative powerful the very creator that
[1:32:16] breathed all the stars here he is in a
[1:32:20] form of a pillar of fire now that life
[1:32:25] is being expressed that life is being
[1:32:29] ministered
[1:32:30] are we sufficiently impressed bicep is
[1:32:34] it I believe that as we grow and as all
[1:32:38] the valleys and the mountains and all
[1:32:40] the and here we are
[1:32:42] there's no crookedness and the path
[1:32:43] between us and our God there's no one
[1:32:46] lane highways you know sometimes you
[1:32:48] know some people give their experience
[1:32:51] of God is a gravel windy road cliff on
[1:32:54] one side and they're right next to the
[1:32:56] edge of the cliff there's some people's
[1:32:58] experience and then on the other end
[1:33:00] you've got some people that they're just
[1:33:02] so full of God and they're so just full
[1:33:07] of God and you'd love to be around them
[1:33:08] and they're just so nice and in kind and
[1:33:11] and imbalanced and and they always have
[1:33:13] something to say that's good but they
[1:33:16] don't just yell it all out it's just the
[1:33:17] life of God they got a seven lane
[1:33:20] highway they've come under the full
[1:33:22] effect of this message because when they
[1:33:25] heard it they let 1% of grain give you
[1:33:31] all of my emissions I give you all of my
[1:33:34] hobbies I give you all of my likes all
[1:33:36] of my dislikes I'll give you everything
[1:33:38] everything and all of a sudden you can't
[1:33:43] get enough of a message you're like John
[1:33:45] and you're in the book of Revelation
[1:33:47] chapter 10 verse 8 and I said I heard a
[1:33:49] voice which speakers from him just go
[1:33:51] and take the book out of the seventh
[1:33:55] angels hand no not out of the seven
[1:33:57] angels hand he's a critic is a key here
[1:34:00] out of the hand of him that stands upon
[1:34:04] the CNF on the earth you are called to
[1:34:06] eat from the Lord's hand now the Lord
[1:34:10] spoke that Thrones vindicated prophet
[1:34:12] but you are to go beyond the vessels
[1:34:15] beyond the flesh amen when I look at
[1:34:18] that pillar of fire video photo down the
[1:34:21] back there when I see that I'm not just
[1:34:24] looking at a Kentucky and I'm looking at
[1:34:25] my god I'm looking at the pillar of fire
[1:34:28] the Prophet just happened to be
[1:34:30] privileged to get his photo taken the
[1:34:32] pillar of fire but that photo is the
[1:34:34] pillar of fire amen where is that photo
[1:34:35] here I like that this is my my my lord
[1:34:41] here in a perform of a pillar of fire
[1:34:43] the same one that led the children of
[1:34:44] Israel and the Prophet just heaven no no
[1:34:48] you happened to get privileged enough
[1:34:50] for the Lord to benefit himself in this
[1:34:52] dimension and a camera took it all right
[1:34:56] how do I black this off here we go we
[1:35:03] are called to go beyond the flesh we're
[1:35:06] called to take the book from the hands
[1:35:09] of him that stands upon the CN upon the
[1:35:11] earth a man prophesies this and I heard
[1:35:17] a voice then that spoke to me that was
[1:35:21] in the room said this is what you
[1:35:23] preached was the Holy Ghost this is
[1:35:25] perfect love and nothing can enter here
[1:35:27] without it he also says this and
[1:35:32] whatever he says to you do it I like the
[1:35:35] title of it he says now perfect faith
[1:35:37] just like perfect love casts out all
[1:35:40] fear
[1:35:41] all doubting if you believe it no matter
[1:35:44] what the symptoms are what the results
[1:35:47] you believe it just the same so there's
[1:35:53] a perfect connection under Elijah's
[1:35:55] ministry must be manifest to allow total
[1:35:58] deliverance and restoration that is why
[1:36:04] all of the paths and all of us has made
[1:36:07] like the plain of megiddo ready for the
[1:36:08] Battle of Armageddon that's going to see
[1:36:11] you filled with the Holy Ghost it's got
[1:36:13] to see you come across into your
[1:36:15] inheritance it's going to see you in a
[1:36:17] condition where the the devil has no way
[1:36:20] around and you are completely free and
[1:36:23] anytime the devil comes you see him a
[1:36:25] mile away can't hide cuz there's no help
[1:36:27] there's no mountains firm to hide behind
[1:36:29] oh man do you catch that you see that
[1:36:35] it's powerful that's amazing this is the
[1:36:39] climate we're in one day I was praying
[1:36:42] and we were burdened for things that was
[1:36:46] happening and people that were
[1:36:47] struggling and you know people will talk
[1:36:49] to you about stuff and you feel burdened
[1:36:50] for them until you pray you say Lord
[1:36:52] this is this is a lot
[1:36:54] this is like fire this is just so much
[1:36:59] so we're praying and then and then and
[1:37:02] and I'm praying and then and then this
[1:37:05] you know it was like I don't know how to
[1:37:07] describe it but all of a sudden the
[1:37:09] atmosphere changing I could see it and a
[1:37:11] bit more of a perspective like God could
[1:37:12] see it and and it was like it just
[1:37:15] dawned the season that we're own as a
[1:37:19] season where the mountains and the
[1:37:20] valleys are coming together and there's
[1:37:21] a climate of perfect love and all of
[1:37:25] your trials the final things that are
[1:37:28] hiding in your life are going to be
[1:37:30] delivered and the reason is is because
[1:37:33] we're all coming back to our first love
[1:37:35] and in this love environment the fear of
[1:37:38] rejection the fear of being criticized
[1:37:41] as disappears in love and so you feel
[1:37:44] open to be able to share these things
[1:37:46] with us and them and the pastor
[1:37:48] especially who's called to cancel and
[1:37:51] speed of the Lord so that gift could
[1:37:54] operate and the people actually come to
[1:37:59] an experience when brother Brandon went
[1:38:01] beyond the curtain of time and he said
[1:38:03] no son could be there and he said I
[1:38:06] could just there was it was just such a
[1:38:08] perfect love and here's perfect love
[1:38:10] descending down into this dimension upon
[1:38:13] the church to bring us into a climate
[1:38:15] where you can trust your pastor where
[1:38:17] you can open up and receive counsel on
[1:38:20] the most embarrassing things that you
[1:38:22] could ever imagine that you never
[1:38:23] thought you'd ever see of anyone and if
[1:38:25] you hold on to those things you'll never
[1:38:27] get delivered of it and the Lord needs a
[1:38:29] climate where the mountains come down
[1:38:31] and the valleys come up so that you can
[1:38:34] have your trials the valley trials and a
[1:38:36] climate of love instead of just being
[1:38:38] down in the dumps gone through these
[1:38:47] things is happening and your your your
[1:38:50] maintaining an environment where you
[1:38:52] feel like you can trust people now and
[1:38:54] this is Edenic condition forming because
[1:38:57] here is an Eden here's a needy anat
[1:38:59] condition
[1:39:00] he's a needy Annette condition he's a
[1:39:01] needy Anat condition he's an idiot
[1:39:03] condition here's a needy enik condition
[1:39:04] all through and
[1:39:06] of a sudden here's an environment where
[1:39:08] Eden is almost manifesting on the earth
[1:39:11] and all of a sudden the people ain't got
[1:39:14] nowhere to hide all of a sudden she
[1:39:16] becomes an invincible army because the
[1:39:19] devil got nowhere to hide you know this
[1:39:21] is and so the Lord kind of showed me
[1:39:24] that and I was like well when I start
[1:39:26] telling Bob and all about it it was very
[1:39:28] late and I pray too long and honey was
[1:39:31] sleeping I didn't realize you're
[1:39:32] sleeping though well I I just I was
[1:39:35] talking for about 15 minutes telling her
[1:39:37] I was like so excited and I said you
[1:39:40] know I was I didn't give her a chance to
[1:39:42] respond and I thought she was listening
[1:39:44] because we were praying you know like we
[1:39:45] were like this and she's got on it I
[1:39:48] thought oh well I'm gonna write this
[1:39:49] down this so and then I started writing
[1:39:51] it and then this is what came so this is
[1:39:54] what this is so it's like kind of
[1:39:57] supernaturally like just show us where
[1:40:00] we're at we are here
[1:40:01] that's not somewhere to come we are here
[1:40:04] now that you know the grace that is here
[1:40:07] in this love all the fear and all the
[1:40:11] inhibitions the station has built up and
[1:40:15] now I'm gonna say one more thing can I
[1:40:17] hit five more minutes said all right I
[1:40:19] promise
[1:40:22] hmm okay so can you everyone see that
[1:40:30] I'm not gonna go right into it but this
[1:40:34] is don't worry about the top okay let's
[1:40:39] just look at the bottom you have Abraham
[1:40:42] in the promised land
[1:40:43] receiving the promise - he owns it all
[1:40:47] as far as the eye could see right as far
[1:40:50] as the eye could see you own it all
[1:40:52] Abraham take it that's all yours but did
[1:40:55] Abraham actually get access to it it was
[1:40:58] all hers he could have taken it you know
[1:41:01] he had the anointing but was it the
[1:41:03] season you know when when all of the
[1:41:06] kings took lot and what he expressed
[1:41:08] that there was power to take it cuz he
[1:41:11] just would talk people with farm plows
[1:41:12] and shares and go took over all the
[1:41:14] nations he won it all
[1:41:17] and he was in fellowship with
[1:41:18] Melchizedek in the land identity was
[1:41:21] very reality to him he knew at all just
[1:41:23] like Paul then you have Isaac Jacob and
[1:41:31] Joseph so these four they had an
[1:41:34] identity of apostolic land they believe
[1:41:38] they were free people and Joseph
[1:41:41] experienced now coming into the Dark Age
[1:41:46] where they came into slavery right now
[1:41:49] in slavery for hundred years now here's
[1:41:52] the key to this and I don't want to go
[1:41:54] through all this I'm not preaching the
[1:41:55] sermon so this is the seven Church ages
[1:41:57] in the Old Testament but I'm not
[1:41:59] preaching this what I wanted what I want
[1:42:01] to show you here is Satan God promised
[1:42:05] this is how cunning than tricky the
[1:42:07] devil is when Satan was standing Satan
[1:42:11] was standing there listening to God's
[1:42:12] tell Abraham your people so show June
[1:42:15] 400 years right they're gonna go to
[1:42:17] Egypt they're gonna and then I'm gonna
[1:42:18] bring them out with a great deliverance
[1:42:20] so Satan was like oh you're sweet let's
[1:42:22] see a let's see what I'm gonna say what
[1:42:25] a say sing go to do Randy go starts
[1:42:27] working straight away and he builds up
[1:42:29] all the walls he builds up all the
[1:42:31] military he takes the tree of knowledge
[1:42:33] and he builds up all of the inhibitions
[1:42:36] all of the struggles all of the
[1:42:38] mentality so he built up the enemy and
[1:42:40] he I'll tell you how much it is what's
[1:42:44] the first plate the foot when they got
[1:42:45] to the land how big was those walls do
[1:42:48] you think that Satan was not trying to
[1:42:51] stop them from getting into the land how
[1:42:54] big was those walls those walls could
[1:42:57] have chariots running right around them
[1:42:59] right those people did not think that
[1:43:02] they are coming in and you know what
[1:43:03] they couldn't get in there's no way they
[1:43:05] could penetrate that as a natural people
[1:43:07] but they weren't just the natural people
[1:43:09] hallelujah
[1:43:10] they had a captain amen they have
[1:43:13] descended mighty angel all my hallelujah
[1:43:16] with the vision oh my it's not sorry I
[1:43:19] promised I wouldn't do this
[1:43:23] so here's satan building up all of the
[1:43:26] resistance but it doesn't stop there
[1:43:29] he's done that for us but doesn't stop
[1:43:31] there he's not just building up the
[1:43:34] resistance over here in the land again
[1:43:37] you know he's not just what he he's now
[1:43:39] working in here so in the dark ages and
[1:43:43] the dark ages now this is a lot but just
[1:43:48] just just just believe this that's true
[1:43:51] and the dark ages here Israel lost their
[1:43:56] identity 400 years of slavery
[1:43:59] their mentality became slaves they
[1:44:02] bought like slaves
[1:44:03] they lost their identity they forgot
[1:44:06] what it was like under the Epis taluk
[1:44:08] age they forgot what it was like to see
[1:44:10] the great miracles and they but they
[1:44:12] were true believers but they lost their
[1:44:16] identity and so we see that when they
[1:44:22] came across the Red Sea when God finally
[1:44:25] delivered them 430 years later they came
[1:44:28] across the Red Sea now the first barrage
[1:44:32] of resistance coming out was their slave
[1:44:41] mentality and demon powers God's just
[1:44:44] brought you out here to kill you you
[1:44:45] guys are better off in Egypt and they
[1:44:48] wanted to go back to the slavery have
[1:44:50] you ever seen anyone want to go back to
[1:44:51] slavery have you ever seen anyone go
[1:44:55] back because of the slave mentality
[1:44:59] well people they just don't want to go
[1:45:00] forward with the Lord because they just
[1:45:03] think like slaves they just sit there
[1:45:05] nothing ever happens in their life cuz
[1:45:08] they're struggling struggling so here
[1:45:14] you hit they come across and they're
[1:45:17] justified by the baptism in the Red Sea
[1:45:20] and then they come further into the
[1:45:22] wilderness and the sacrificial system is
[1:45:24] released and then they and the blood and
[1:45:27] the sanctification process takes place
[1:45:29] but still there's a mentality and they
[1:45:32] fight against it and they say
[1:45:34] see God had a captain for them waiting
[1:45:37] all I needed to do was believe the word
[1:45:39] and across the Jordan if they just went
[1:45:41] across if they just believed if they
[1:45:43] just crossed over there was a captain
[1:45:45] waiting to free Rahab there was a
[1:45:48] captain waiting they said this is the
[1:45:55] slave mentality the devil was working it
[1:46:01] especially our selves a get them because
[1:46:03] the slave mentality could not receive
[1:46:06] the grace of God they they they saw God
[1:46:10] as a slave driver they saw God as
[1:46:13] someone that wanted them to die in the
[1:46:15] wilderness
[1:46:15] even though they'd seen all the miracles
[1:46:18] because of their speed mentality these
[1:46:20] are barriers and finally they come here
[1:46:25] to the River Jordan and then at Kadesh
[1:46:28] Barnea and finally under Joshua's
[1:46:31] message they believe that believers
[1:46:34] Joshua and Caleb and all the younger
[1:46:36] generation come across and they meet the
[1:46:38] real captain
[1:46:39] and now finally now that they've come
[1:46:42] from vir now that they come here it's
[1:46:46] going to be a long journey for them and
[1:46:48] God's going to take the slave mentality
[1:46:50] out of them and it's the same here let
[1:46:53] me run through it as quickly we have the
[1:46:57] seven church ages right here right
[1:46:59] we have Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira
[1:47:01] and the church went into the dark ages
[1:47:05] and they lost their identity that's why
[1:47:09] and satan built up a society he built up
[1:47:13] barriers he built up isms he built up
[1:47:16] ideologies he built up all the
[1:47:17] civilization to resist you to resist you
[1:47:22] to keep you down to keep you in the main
[1:47:25] Age to keep you in an age of
[1:47:27] civilization building to keep your joy
[1:47:29] outside of the Lord he did these things
[1:47:32] he built it all up but not just that he
[1:47:36] gave you parents that would give you a
[1:47:38] slave
[1:47:39] he gave you parents and parents and
[1:47:41] grandparents and traditions from the
[1:47:43] dark age that's why you struggle but God
[1:47:46] Richard mercy sent you a message he sent
[1:47:50] you a message hallelujah
[1:47:53] he sent you a Joshua to take you across
[1:47:56] Jordan to preach your across Jordan but
[1:47:58] not just to stay there he gave you a
[1:48:00] captain that you were to marry and so
[1:48:03] you were like Rahab and you stood there
[1:48:05] oh yeah and under the word that was
[1:48:08] released a message would take all the
[1:48:10] crookedness all of the dark ages all of
[1:48:13] the inhibitions all of these things you
[1:48:15] see the stark age of thyatira sardis
[1:48:19] they didn't have the apostolic version
[1:48:20] and in philadelphia they didn't have
[1:48:23] they had a little portion but not enough
[1:48:25] and even in the Pentecostal time and
[1:48:27] Laird to see her you know when they
[1:48:29] pulled out the guest they still saw like
[1:48:30] men and finally a messenger but was to
[1:48:39] take the people a William Branham a
[1:48:41] messenger I like to Republic and Joshua
[1:48:44] to take the people out of
[1:48:46] denominationalism to take you to take
[1:48:49] your parents to take our forefathers to
[1:48:52] take those who were around come out of
[1:48:54] denominationalism so he took them out
[1:48:56] and they started to believe and they
[1:48:59] preached and they loved it but still is
[1:49:02] a process and we are we are at the end
[1:49:05] of that process of where verse mentality
[1:49:08] has finally started to come out of the
[1:49:12] people because the people came out at
[1:49:15] the no Malaysian ISM came out of the man
[1:49:16] age come out of all the inhibitions all
[1:49:18] the cultural limitations and all these
[1:49:20] things so you could come into a climate
[1:49:24] of love so that you could truly react to
[1:49:27] the word so that you could truly worship
[1:49:29] so that the supernatural will manifest
[1:49:32] in your life and its formation without
[1:49:34] any inhibitions without any doubts
[1:49:35] without any frustrations without any
[1:49:37] fear without any of these cultural
[1:49:39] disasters that came from the Dark Ages
[1:49:41] that came from World War one came from
[1:49:44] World War two and all your fathers and
[1:49:46] our fathers who are destroyed and their
[1:49:48] fathers were destroyed in the war their
[1:49:50] mentalities was broken down
[1:49:52] and all the society and Satan built it
[1:49:54] all up but he sent a message to remove
[1:50:00] it out of you and it's been 50 years and
[1:50:05] finally let's come to the season let's
[1:50:08] come to the season now we're no better
[1:50:10] than our forefathers we're no better
[1:50:12] than the other be out the old school
[1:50:14] ministry it's not that anyone that's
[1:50:17] alive now is going to be a beneficiary
[1:50:19] and move into it it's a different season

[2:03:08] with every eye closed and every heart
[2:03:11] bow to the Lord while the music's play
[2:03:13] the Lord is here and he is watching and
[2:03:19] he's not just watching the flesh the
[2:03:21] flesh doesn't mean too much what he's
[2:03:23] looking at is the heart the Lord way is
[2:03:26] the heart tonight there is a wait and
[2:03:31] there are some people in this room that
[2:03:34] are weighed in the balance
[2:03:36] and they found wanting there is an empty
[2:03:40] some empty people in this room and the
[2:03:43] Lord is weighing your heart tonight and
[2:03:46] he's looking for decisions to be made
[2:03:49] he's looking for that last 1% to be
[2:03:52] surrendered he wants to receive some
[2:03:56] people but he can't receive and I'm
[2:03:59] surrendering
[2:04:01] and so if there is somebody in this room
[2:04:05] that hasn't surrendered their heart that
[2:04:09] it's really sick of being tossed to and

[2:04:39] wants a cool tree someone is looking for
[2:04:43] a cold drink some on the world stability
[2:04:45] someone that wants the Lord that this
[2:04:48] someone in this room
