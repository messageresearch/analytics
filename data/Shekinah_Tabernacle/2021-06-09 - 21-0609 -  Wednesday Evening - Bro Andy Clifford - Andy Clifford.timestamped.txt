[27:13] we have to say lord i need something
[27:15] tonight.
[27:16] otherwise you'll sit there and you'll
[27:18] think why is it that these sermons are
[27:19] always not relevant to me or
[27:21] why is this what is going on here lord
[27:24] and and i just i can encourage you now
[27:26] if you really just
[27:27] if you if you ask the lord he will speak
[27:29] to you it's very simple
[27:31] and it's a very supernatural event
[27:33] that's taking place amen
[27:35] while we're standing i just want to
[27:36] invite your attention to
[27:38] jude chapter one which is the only
[27:41] chapter in jude
[27:42] verse 20 to 23. and i want to speak
[27:45] this evening on a subject called fight
[27:48] back

[28:03] up yourselves
[28:05] on your most holy faith praying in the

[29:01] pulling them out of the fire hating even
[29:04] the garment

[29:16] here
[29:17] the horse is prepared against the day of
[29:19] battle
[29:20] but safety is of the lord amen i like
[29:23] that balance here because
[29:24] tonight we're going to talk about
[29:25] fighting and and and
[29:28] and and and whether you fight back
[29:32] as a reaction when the devils hit you
[29:34] from behind because you somehow got
[29:36] blindsided and
[29:37] we get blindsided from time to time okay
[29:39] that happens
[29:40] because sometimes we get busy and all of
[29:42] a sudden boom and it's hit
[29:44] and it's too late you've got to now get
[29:45] up and work your way out of it
[29:48] by the lord's grace you know he pulls us
[29:51] up he gives us
[29:52] grace amen or fight first
[29:55] amen hallelujah we are in a time
[29:59] and you know i'll get to it but i just
[30:01] want to say before we go any further
[30:03] we're in a time of great calamity
[30:06] now right now in new zealand we're just
[30:09] living it up man we're living a dream
[30:11] we're having it all easy we can go and
[30:13] earn money we can have a good job we can
[30:15] see our friends and we can worship god
[30:17] how we want to worship god and
[30:19] according to the revelation of this
[30:21] message
[30:23] uh and and all the way out there you can
[30:25] go and you can buy nice things
[30:27] you can eat your fill of the tree of
[30:30] knowledge
[30:30] of good and evil tonight and today and
[30:33] all over the time in your life right now
[30:35] but let me tell you
[30:37] that underneath it all well and and
[30:39] maybe some of you are seeing this
[30:41] and some of you are not seeing this but
[30:43] underneath it all is it's just a veneer
[30:46] and underneath it all is a great
[30:48] calamity and a great emergency is
[30:50] dawning upon us
[30:51] it's emerging and it's change it's going
[30:53] to change everything
[30:54] that you think everything that you think
[30:56] of life right now is going to
[30:58] drastically change
[30:59] i'm not trying to put fear on you but i
[31:01] just want you to really search
[31:03] your heart with god and say lord what is
[31:06] he talking about
[31:07] what does he mean this veneer what is
[31:09] this tiny you know what a veneer is
[31:10] it's like this or you know like you can
[31:13] make this nice furniture you know and
[31:14] it's real
[31:15] beautiful and it's like some african
[31:18] mahogany you know
[31:19] and uh and and if it's just a veneer
[31:22] it's just one mil thick
[31:23] it's just and underneath is mdf or
[31:26] chipboard you know
[31:28] it's like what i tell you a story you
[31:30] know i had this table when i grew up
[31:32] it was my parents table and i grew up
[31:34] with a statement i thought it was
[31:35] mahogany or some wood
[31:37] and it was good wood you know i thought
[31:39] man this is a good table good solid
[31:40] table board in the 80s you know
[31:42] and you know only i think only humans
[31:45] came out that was the only thing good
[31:47] that came out of the 80s you know
[31:48] is people everything else kind of just
[31:51] has got a lot to answer for but
[31:52] this table this table was just
[31:56] nice and i was like you know what i'm
[31:58] going to sand this
[32:00] so i begin to give this table a trial
[32:02] you know i'm like sanding it back
[32:03] because you know i wanted to craft
[32:05] something beautiful out of this table
[32:07] and i'm standing this table and all of a
[32:09] sudden appearing underneath me
[32:11] there's these blobs these like light
[32:14] brown circles and i'm like what is going
[32:16] on here
[32:17] what is this and i was like no
[32:21] all of my life i thought this was a
[32:23] solid mahogany table
[32:24] it was veneer it was veneer and i ruined
[32:28] the thing
[32:30] amen we used it anyway for a few years
[32:33] until we outgrew it because
[32:34] you know we just used that fellowship
[32:36] and it was like we could get eight
[32:37] people
[32:38] seven people at the table and it was
[32:39] always like 20 people there you know i
[32:41] was like we needed a bigger table so we
[32:42] got rid of that but the point i'm
[32:43] meaning is here
[32:44] is that's what this world is this world
[32:48] may look good and it may
[32:49] provide for you and the tree of
[32:51] knowledge provides for you right now
[32:53] because you go work you earn money and
[32:55] you go and invest into the tree of
[32:57] knowledge of good and evil
[32:58] you invest into the system of lucifer
[33:00] and hey i'm not saying it's wrong we
[33:01] have to live and plant our potatoes and
[33:03] do all those things
[33:04] you invest into that you're actually
[33:06] buying into an economy of the devil
[33:08] it's his economy it's his masterpiece
[33:10] it's his ideas
[33:11] this is what he foresaw before way back
[33:14] when he had the big fight with michael
[33:16] way back way way back before the
[33:18] foundation of the world this was his
[33:19] idea and you're seeing it
[33:21] but all it is is just a facade all it is
[33:24] is this thing that makes you feel good
[33:25] and distracts you and gives you all
[33:27] these things to do
[33:29] young children it gives you sports it
[33:31] gives you all of these things in schools
[33:33] and school friends and school and all
[33:34] that stuff but it's just
[33:36] a veneer it's one millimeter thick
[33:39] if you begin to sand that veneer
[33:42] that looks so good this life this world
[33:45] out there
[33:45] all of these activities that's going on
[33:47] all of the rugby all of the soccer all
[33:50] of these things that are so fun and so
[33:52] good
[33:53] you begin to sand that down and all of a
[33:56] sudden
[33:57] there's nothing absolutely nothing there
[34:01] because as soon as you know it before
[34:03] you know it it's going to disappear
[34:04] and you won't be allowed to partake in
[34:06] it
[34:07] we'll be ostracized we'll be given
[34:11] all these things are going to change and
[34:12] so what we're seeing right now
[34:14] is you know it says peace and safety it
[34:16] says and and
[34:18] and and the lord delayeth is coming it
[34:20] might be a hundred years but
[34:21] you see the spirit of god i believe is
[34:24] putting an urgency
[34:26] forward to us to have an expectation
[34:30] young ones whether you're six seven
[34:32] eight ten whatever
[34:33] an expectation this evening that he
[34:36] could come tomorrow
[34:38] he could come tomorrow i know there's
[34:40] these movies and things that need to be
[34:41] made but you know what
[34:42] he can come tomorrow you know that and
[34:45] when you least
[34:46] expect it the son of man cometh
[34:50] right so we need to be ready we need to
[34:53] let's not put off tomorrow what we can
[34:55] have today
[34:56] because then when you have him then he
[34:59] he is like you know a watch you know has
[35:01] all of the springs and all of the things
[35:02] inside it but it has a main spring
[35:04] and that main spring in the watch is the
[35:06] main thing that causes everything in
[35:08] that watch to come together
[35:09] a human being without the holy ghost has
[35:12] no mainspring
[35:13] but when the mainspring comes down it
[35:15] puts a mainstream
[35:16] the holy ghost comes down it puts that
[35:18] very cog within your life
[35:20] to make everything work it doesn't take
[35:23] away your trials it doesn't take away
[35:25] your suffering but it makes everything
[35:26] work
[35:27] it brings you into balance it brings you
[35:29] into a a life that is
[35:31] happy so that when you go and do those
[35:34] things and you're
[35:35] still sowing into the tree of knowledge
[35:37] for a time and season it's going to
[35:38] change
[35:39] but for now you'll be sowing into it so
[35:42] now you've got to
[35:42] get a job and you've got to take that
[35:44] money where does that money come from it
[35:45] doesn't come from god
[35:47] but we're utilizing it's a tool you know
[35:49] and where
[35:50] you put money you don't put money all
[35:52] the way up here in your life
[35:54] it's not important money is not
[35:56] important
[35:57] it's necessary but it's a tool and god
[35:59] gave you the blessing of abraham to rule
[36:01] over it
[36:02] not for money to rule over you not for
[36:05] you to get all funny about money
[36:06] excuse the rhyme but not for you to get
[36:09] you know some people get so
[36:10] strange about money and as soon as money
[36:12] comes into the
[36:13] picture it's like they get all weird and
[36:16] oh i'm so scared of
[36:18] you know and you don't want to show
[36:19] anybody it's like well who cares it's
[36:21] just money it's just a tool
[36:23] it's just a tool and god said you're the
[36:26] royal seed of abraham
[36:27] you don't have to worry about finances
[36:30] you don't have to be funny about it
[36:32] it's just nothing if you just serve god
[36:35] and put him first
[36:36] all the provision will come everything
[36:38] will come he provided this for your
[36:41] freedom
[36:41] so you could worship so that you could
[36:43] redeem the time and
[36:45] and live a life of worship and peace
[36:48] in the midst of all of this turmoil the
[36:50] devil doesn't want that
[36:52] that you know those horse riders how
[36:54] that black horse rider i think we
[36:55] listened to a while back
[36:57] he was this one that had the balances in
[36:58] his hand and he began to control people
[37:00] with money and
[37:01] suck all the money of the world that's
[37:03] an anointing of the devil
[37:05] and that anointing hasn't gone he wants
[37:08] to put pressure on people
[37:10] he wants to pressure you with finances
[37:13] he wants you to worry about them
[37:14] he wants you to have fear and it will
[37:16] deactivate your faith
[37:18] if you begin to worry about it but if
[37:20] you you know but in all simplicity right
[37:23] now
[37:24] if you just say i just you know i'm just
[37:27] going to
[37:27] be diligent with my things and lord i
[37:30] put you first
[37:31] lord i know you'll provide you begin to
[37:34] sow into the kingdom of god
[37:36] you'll never have to worry about
[37:37] finances again
[37:39] i can testify this is my life
[37:42] i'm a living testimony of such things
[37:46] amen he's provided for me everything
[37:50] hallelujah amen well praise god
[37:54] that was completely in another direction
[37:57] but anyway this is all about a fight you
[37:58] know sometimes you've got to expose the
[38:00] devil right
[38:01] and that's that's just one veneer of the
[38:03] devil one veneer
[38:05] that's money it's a big thing you know
[38:07] it's this and it can be it can be a
[38:08] you know like a mountain out of a mohu
[38:10] what do you call it like when you just
[38:12] make something so big exacerbated but
[38:15] it's not really
[38:15] a big issue if as a son of god as a
[38:19] child and a seed of abraham
[38:21] hallelujah proverbs 21 31 says the horse
[38:24] is prepared
[38:25] against the day of battle but safety is
[38:27] of the lord you know this word safety
[38:29] it means rescue or or
[38:33] or a national deliverance or a
[38:35] individual deliverance
[38:37] a spiritual deliverance the horse is
[38:40] prepared until the day of battle
[38:41] you must prepare for the calamity that's
[38:44] here for the emergency that's coming
[38:47] you know i preached up to brother
[38:48] elrey's and i decla
[38:51] you know i felt on my heart to declare
[38:53] an emergency
[38:54] because in an emergency special powers
[38:56] are given to the people
[38:58] the controllers hello you are
[39:00] controllers you have been called with a
[39:02] dominion
[39:03] over sin over this world over darkness
[39:06] over yourself
[39:07] the old nature and in a time of
[39:09] emergency a special power comes upon the
[39:12] people
[39:12] to inaugurate you to to to give you
[39:17] what is activated it's already in you
[39:19] it's like these world governments and
[39:20] all of those people in the natural
[39:22] you know without an emergency on man
[39:24] they want to change laws
[39:25] they have opinions they have ideas they
[39:27] have satanic ideologies that are
[39:29] controlling them
[39:30] and they would love to be able to change
[39:32] law and then what happens is that many
[39:34] countries do it they declare an
[39:35] emergency and they live in a state of
[39:37] emergency
[39:38] and then they just change laws because
[39:40] they have a power
[39:41] to change laws in the middle of normal
[39:44] life they just declare an emergency
[39:46] and all of a sudden they begin to change
[39:48] laws and it doesn't need to be
[39:49] it doesn't need to be you know okayed by
[39:51] the people and have big government
[39:52] meetings
[39:53] they just say we're going to do this
[39:55] because in the idea of safety of the
[39:57] people
[39:57] but how much more a people that realize
[40:01] what time we're in it will bring you to
[40:04] a desperation
[40:05] it will bring you to an alertness a
[40:07] sobriety
[40:08] in this hour to realize that
[40:11] sitting back and just warming a pew is
[40:14] just not enough now
[40:16] hallelujah that's just not enough
[40:19] amen this is the time to rise up
[40:23] this is a time to say lord what am i
[40:26] here for
[40:27] well what is my calling what is my
[40:29] purpose what have you brought me here on
[40:31] this earth
[40:32] young one right now because you see you
[40:35] might not get old
[40:36] so do something for god now hallelujah
[40:39] you get down on your knees and say lord
[40:41] will you sit on your bed at night and
[40:43] you say lord
[40:44] that brother said that i should pray
[40:47] and ask you what is my life for
[40:51] i can guarantee you if you really mean
[40:53] that before god he will come to you
[40:55] he will speak to you he will tell you
[40:57] something that you need to know
[41:00] hallelujah
[41:05] safety deliverance help safety salvation
[41:08] victory so there's a people that would
[41:11] see through the veneer and declare
[41:13] this that this power begins to emerge
[41:17] in this time of emergency a power
[41:19] emerges because of the pressure
[41:22] because of the things that come on a
[41:23] great squeeze
[41:25] would come on a people and it would
[41:27] cause something to emerge from that
[41:29] squeeze and that's what an emergency is
[41:32] something trouble strikes or war strikes
[41:35] or
[41:36] a calamity strikes and it presses people
[41:39] it presses you
[41:40] and it reveals all the good that's in
[41:43] you
[41:44] it reveals the good things it reveals
[41:47] what you really are
[41:52] amen are you with me
[42:01] fight back or fight first
[42:04] now i want to just show you something
[42:06] and those that you
[42:07] of you that read the news especially the
[42:09] middle east news you probably already
[42:11] know this
[42:12] but i just want to invite your attention
[42:14] to something that is
[42:15] quite significant and we know that
[42:18] israel types
[42:20] the bride natural and to spiritual and
[42:23] when you see something going on in the
[42:25] state of israel
[42:27] and you see attacks coming on and you
[42:28] see an escalation
[42:30] you can rest assured that there's an
[42:32] escalation happening in the bride
[42:34] you can rest assured you can mark my
[42:36] words tonight
[42:37] that when you see a calamity striking
[42:39] and when you see something changing
[42:40] there
[42:41] you can mark my words tonight that
[42:43] something's changing
[42:44] something is changing in your midst
[42:46] tonight there is a pressure coming on
[42:48] there is an oncoming storm and it may
[42:51] look really good and
[42:52] the devil is going to make trees going
[42:53] to do his best to hide it
[42:55] until it's too late he's going to turn
[42:57] up that heat slowly
[42:59] until it's boiling and if it's too late
[43:00] the frog dies who knows the analogy
[43:04] now you don't want to be that frog who
[43:07] knows that story do the children know
[43:08] that story
[43:10] how if you put a frog in cold water
[43:13] and you turn that water on slowly and
[43:15] slowly and bring it to the boil the frog
[43:17] will cook
[43:18] but if you put the frog in boiling water
[43:21] it will jump straight out the devil's
[43:23] not that stupid i mean he's dumb but
[43:25] he's not that stupid
[43:26] he's going to try and connive and trick
[43:29] and he's going to slowly turn it up
[43:30] until it's too late
[43:32] so i'm telling you now rise up out of
[43:35] your comfort
[43:36] come away from your comfort zones
[43:38] tonight
[43:39] for it is a time of an emergency there
[43:41] is a pressure coming there's a storm
[43:43] coming
[43:44] and it's time for you to rise up out of
[43:46] your comfort zones
[43:47] it's time for you to get down serious
[43:49] with the lord and say lord

[44:02] i don't i want to i want to hear the
[44:03] voice of god for my hour
[44:05] i want to hear what he's speaking what
[44:07] the spirit would say
[44:09] to the church this evening
[44:12] amen
[44:15] hallelujah a senior leuked minister
[44:20] on saturday this is a report
[44:25] said israel would preemptively
[44:28] strike hamas terror group in gaza when
[44:31] it becomes apparent
[44:33] it's when it becomes apparent it's
[44:36] restocking
[44:38] its rocket arsenal and is and spent
[44:41] gearing up to fire at israel
[44:44] as he laid out what he described as the
[44:46] jewish state's
[44:47] new security doctrine
[44:51] we cannot wait he says for rocket fire
[44:54] to respond to gaza said
[44:58] saki hanabi in an interview with channel
[45:02] 13
[45:04] from now on he said the terror groups
[45:07] re-armament and preparations to fire
[45:10] rockets
[45:12] rather than the actual firing is cause
[45:15] for israeli strikes
[45:18] on military targets in gaza this
[45:21] he this is the guy speaking aces this is
[45:23] a total change of the equation
[45:26] we've never done this so you can see now
[45:30] there is a great change happening
[45:32] in the natural bride there's a great
[45:34] change happening
[45:35] they've changed their approach now
[45:36] they're not going to wait for the enemy
[45:38] to strike at them
[45:39] they're going to watch the enemy they're
[45:40] going to have discernment they're going
[45:42] to begin to discern the antichrist
[45:43] spirit in their midst
[45:45] can you discern the antichrist spirit
[45:47] shekinah tabernacle
[45:48] can you see the devil operating around
[45:50] you can you discern what he's doing
[45:52] amongst you
[45:53] when he begins to gossip when people
[45:55] begin to talk
[45:56] and they say things to try and destroy a
[45:59] character can
[46:00] you see it and can you withstand it
[46:03] because that is one of the antichrist
[46:05] spirits greatest
[46:06] tools to try and break down fellowship
[46:09] because it's god's love
[46:10] that will bring the fruit will bring the
[46:13] fellowship will
[46:14] bring the holy ghost on the scene in
[46:16] your life
[46:17] and in the church can you see it there
[46:20] is a discernment
[46:21] that is coming and if we look at the
[46:23] technological advancement
[46:25] of israel in this hour and you can see
[46:29] them
[46:29] begin to have a reconnaissance and an
[46:32] espionage and all those funny french
[46:34] words
[46:35] upon the upon the enemy
[46:38] you see they do all that they can see it
[46:40] all happening and it's like well they
[46:41] just know where that one is and that one
[46:42] is they just know the whole thing
[46:44] and it must really make the enemy mad
[46:46] because they just know where all the
[46:47] enemies are hiding they know all the
[46:49] stuff
[46:50] why they've got a discernment they've
[46:52] got technology
[46:54] and in the countdown the prophet brought
[46:55] a a principle to us
[46:58] that as the technology of the tree of
[47:00] knowledge begins to
[47:01] unfold and manifest in the earth and
[47:04] he said watch israel god's timepiece
[47:07] you can see a development
[47:10] there is a development going on there's
[47:13] a development
[47:15] happening in the technology of israel's
[47:17] discernment to be able to
[47:19] preempt the strike of the enemy
[47:22] to begin to discern the antichrist
[47:24] spirit
[47:25] so that he becomes powerless
[47:29] against them are you with me do you
[47:32] understand
[47:33] that this is being released because a
[47:36] prophet
[47:37] in 1962 in the church age book whenever
[47:40] it was written
[47:41] somewhere around there he said
[47:45] that that same thing would be given to
[47:47] the bride and the devil
[47:49] would be torn down from his kingdom he
[47:52] would be torn down from his position
[47:54] he would be torn down from his ability
[47:57] in the church
[47:58] all of his things that he thought he had
[48:00] and try and rise up and try and
[48:02] be the complex that you worship will try
[48:05] and be the problem that
[48:06] governs your life it's no longer for you
[48:10] you don't have to have a complex that
[48:11] governs your life anymore
[48:13] you don't have to have these things that
[48:14] hinder your fellowship or
[48:16] make it hard for you to talk or be
[48:18] friendly
[48:19] you don't have to have that anymore
[48:21] because god says
[48:22] i will break the yoke of the enemy from
[48:25] off your shoulders
[48:26] and release you from those burdens
[48:29] hallelujah
[48:32] hallelujah
[48:38] nahum 1 13 it says for now will i break
[48:41] his yoke from off thee
[48:43] and will burst thy bonds in thunder
[48:46] hallelujah
[48:47] for now i will break his yoke from off
[48:50] thee

[48:53] anyone want to take this
[48:54] take it take it it's yours i will
[48:58] burst thy bonds and thunder break them
[49:01] that's the power of his blood hallelujah
[49:04] you know that you know you go through
[49:06] the old testament you see how god
[49:08] would deliver israel and he'd do these
[49:10] things but remember it happens and it's
[49:12] for you
[49:13] hallelujah it's for you first
[49:17] yeah all the natural kingdom in the
[49:20] natural land

[49:29] talking about

[49:32] inside you
[49:33] and it's time to conquer it's time for
[49:35] you to own the scriptures that is
[49:37] pertaining to you the youth heard

[49:47] do it for me lord you did it for him

[50:49] spirit
[50:49] and he will be powerless against me and
[50:51] i'm encouraging you tonight and
[50:52] especially as we pray
[50:54] that god will give you spiritual prayer

[52:09] begin to thank him and just be thankful
[52:11] it's not a big complicated thing and
[52:14] it's like

[53:31] catchphrase

[53:35] liar
[53:37] and i hate him

[53:46] entertaining or
[53:47] harboring a demon
[53:51] ideology or a complex or something that
[53:54] the devil uses in our life
[53:57] a complex is not a devil it's a tool
[54:00] that the devil uses
[54:02] it's a leverage that he uses to lever
[54:04] you into something that you don't want
[54:06] to do
[54:07] because of a hurt or a pain and you
[54:09] begin to act in a way that you don't
[54:10] want to act
[54:11] because something activates that but
[54:14] tonight
[54:16] i read that scripture name 1 13
[54:20] take it just take it in simplicity and
[54:22] say lord
[54:24] promise to break these things off me
[54:26] amen
[54:30] isaiah 14 3 let's just we're going to
[54:33] just take
[54:34] a slight um journey here
[54:38] and i want you to think about bringing
[54:40] the devil down
[54:43] the devil has lost his position
[54:46] but he would seek to keep it
[54:50] he will seek to keep his position and
[54:53] the only way he can do it is by lying
[54:57] and even when he's got it it's a lie and
[54:59] it can be torn down like that
[55:02] tearing down strongholds and all these
[55:04] high things and a gate that exalts
[55:06] themselves against the knowledge of god
[55:09] principalities and powers and rulers of
[55:11] darkness
[55:12] where are you seated this evening
[55:16] far above it do you realize how far you
[55:20] are above it
[55:21] you have to reach down to stomp on the
[55:23] devil he's so far below
[55:26] so far down the only way he can come up
[55:29] higher is in your mind
[55:31] he begins to come up by a lie by a fiery
[55:33] dart
[55:34] and that fiery dart gets it's down there
[55:37] way down there
[55:38] way down there and you can stand on it
[55:40] but from there
[55:41] it begins to fire these things up and if
[55:43] you believe that
[55:45] you are exalting the devil
[55:48] up into your mind and you begin to
[55:50] entertain the devil
[55:52] and his thoughts and his processes and
[55:54] all of those things you're bringing him
[55:56] from out of his position which is down
[56:00] now when you think about bringing the
[56:02] devil down because
[56:04] what you're going to see here is how the
[56:07] devil's
[56:07] basically his testimony and you're going
[56:10] to see his end
[56:12] before he goes to the lake of fire and
[56:14] you'll see
[56:15] all of these things in isaiah 14 and
[56:17] we're going to read verse 3
[56:20] to 7 and it says and it shall come to
[56:23] pass in the day that the lord shall give
[56:25] thee rest
[56:26] from thy sorrow and from thy fear
[56:30] and from the hard bondage wherein thou
[56:33] was made
[56:34] to serve
[56:48] i underlined the lord shall give thee
[56:49] rest you know a prophecy
[56:52] because i'm speaking here but i think
[56:54] there are people watching as well
[56:56] but when this ch when we first you know
[56:58] when this church was in its initial
[57:00] stages and we were having a
[57:04] powerful prayer meeting and just crying
[57:06] out to god and
[57:07] there was a tongues and interpretation
[57:08] and the lord spoke and he said
[57:11] that if you remain humble
[57:14] i will draw my
[57:17] people into my rest
[57:20] and my word will go forth
[57:24] from this place so you can find
[57:27] rest in the promise that god
[57:30] specifically made
[57:31] for this region amen that
[57:34] his people could come and find rest and
[57:37] so if you
[57:38] have come and haven't found rest there
[57:41] is a
[57:41] real promise to you this evening
[57:45] that you can find rest tonight you can
[57:48] find
[57:49] rest to your soul the same god that
[57:51] stood there in matthew 11 and said come
[57:53] unto me
[57:54] all that you labor in a heavy laden and
[57:56] i will give you rest to your soul
[57:58] as the same god that came to stokes
[58:00] valley
[58:01] hallelujah and he's here tonight amen to
[58:04] say
[58:05] fine rest this is the purpose
[58:08] that you will cease from your works that
[58:11] you will cease from all your travail and
[58:14] labor
[58:15] in your own flesh trying this and trying
[58:19] that and
[58:20] turning over a new leaf and just over
[58:22] and over and under and out
[58:24] and then and then one day
[58:28] you begin to truly surrender
[58:31] and say lord if you spoke that
[58:34] that night in that prayer meeting then
[58:37] i believe it i'm going to receive that
[58:39] tonight i'm going to receive my rest i'm
[58:41] going to say lord
[58:42] oh hallelujah amen
[58:46] hallelujah this is not a lecture
[58:50] amen who believes that this is not a
[58:53] lecture
[58:54] we're having a you know this is a
[58:56] two-way thing
[58:57] and you know these things being spoken
[59:01] is for you to take and
[59:04] and make it yours you have to
[59:08] you can't just sit there and go man
[59:09] that's a good thought
[59:11] that just you know you just get full of
[59:13] knowledge but really
[59:15] it's got to be deeper it's gotta be more
[59:18] personal
[59:20] hallelujah so i encourage you tonight
[59:23] to take these things personally
[59:33] it says here that thou shalt take up
[59:35] this is verse 4
[59:38] that thou shalt take up this proverb
[59:40] against the king of babylon
[59:42] and say how has the oppressor ceased
[59:45] the golden city ceased the lord hath
[59:48] broken the staff of the wicked
[59:53] and the scepter of the rulers
[59:57] he who smote the people in rough with a
[1:00:00] continual stroke
[1:00:02] over and over just beating the woman
[1:00:04] down beating her down
[1:00:05] beating the church down you know they
[1:00:07] keep rising up there'll be revival and
[1:00:08] then
[1:00:08] beat her down and beat them down i mean
[1:00:10] one day
[1:00:11] god says enough is enough and he said i
[1:00:14] would come in the fullness of my
[1:00:16] presence to break that cycle of revival
[1:00:18] and death
[1:00:18] and you are at the end of it
[1:00:22] you are at the end of the recite cycle
[1:00:24] of rival and death

[1:00:46] rest

[1:00:51] drawing tonight
[1:00:52] that's not unrest that finds themselves
[1:00:55] tossed into and for
[1:00:58] tonight find your rest

[1:01:29] wicked
[1:01:30] and the scepter of the rulers he who
[1:01:33] smote the people in wrath with a
[1:01:35] continual stroke he that ruled the
[1:01:36] nations in anger
[1:01:38] is persecuted and none hindereth
[1:01:41] the whole earth is at rest and is quiet
[1:01:44] and they break forth into singing
[1:01:48] speaking of the millennium
[1:01:52] you could say the biggest scale the age
[1:01:55] or the dispensational level
[1:01:58] i hope you'll understand it's speaking
[1:02:01] of the millennium when
[1:02:02] jesus the king the real government the
[1:02:06] one that knows how to really rule a
[1:02:07] nation

[1:02:14] going to take that jerusalem
[1:02:16] that that center of god's earth
[1:02:19] and he's going to take all that
[1:02:20] disgusting evil religious

[1:02:29] get rid of it he's going to bring it
[1:02:30] back to the way it should be
[1:02:32] hallelujah he's going to convert the
[1:02:35] heart of the earth
[1:02:36] that earth is going to be converted that
[1:02:39] earth is going to receive fiery holy
[1:02:41] ghost

[1:02:44] and it's going to bring peace on the
[1:02:46] earth
[1:02:47] it's going to bring rest to the earth
[1:02:49] it's going to bring rejoicing
[1:02:51] hallelujah amen to the earth
[1:02:54] hallelujah but before that happens
[1:02:57] that bride that will help with that
[1:03:00] government amen you shall rule
[1:03:02] amen with christ amen he says if you're
[1:03:05] faithful
[1:03:06] in the giftings that he gives you and
[1:03:08] the talents and he begins to see fruit
[1:03:12] well done my good and faithful servant
[1:03:14] enter into the joys
[1:03:16] and he says because you are faithful
[1:03:18] with these things
[1:03:19] i will make you rulers of many cities
[1:03:23] so what how did this woman
[1:03:26] hallelujah how did she get trained
[1:03:31] how did she learn how to govern the
[1:03:34] earth
[1:03:36] what was it that the lord allowed in her
[1:03:38] life
[1:03:40] to receive training
[1:03:43] over the to to rule over the earth
[1:03:46] it was the very same thing
[1:03:50] coming down into her earth into your
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:54] the holy ghost coming down so when i
[1:03:57] read this
[1:03:58] because this event of lucifer's fall
[1:04:02] and of lucifer losing his position of
[1:04:04] the devil losing his hold
[1:04:06] of those complexes going of all of that
[1:04:08] depression leaving
[1:04:10] of all the alcoholism and all of the
[1:04:12] drugs and all of the fear
[1:04:13] and all of the bondage and all of the
[1:04:15] satanic influence
[1:04:17] over your life all of those things that
[1:04:19] you inherited
[1:04:20] all of the demons that are troubling you
[1:04:23] in your flesh
[1:04:25] to be brought down to be broken
[1:04:27] completely
[1:04:28] to be brought down hallelujah
[1:04:32] by his anointing not your own works not
[1:04:35] your own travail not your own
[1:04:36] ability not by might nor by power
[1:04:40] but by my spirit saith the lord
[1:04:43] hallelujah
[1:04:44] by his spirit not by your own effort
[1:04:48] because if it's your effort you haven't
[1:04:50] entered into rest
[1:04:52] to let the one that comes in hallelujah
[1:04:56] to your earth to bring you as a
[1:05:00] clay earth little living body
[1:05:04] into what i read here in isaiah 14 7
[1:05:07] the whole earth is at rest
[1:05:11] and is quiet they break forth
[1:05:14] into singing your victory
[1:05:17] lies between faith and rejoicing
[1:05:21] your victory this evening lies between
[1:05:24] faith
[1:05:25] and rejoicing amen
[1:05:29] you see faith cometh by hearing the word
[1:05:34] and you believe unto salvation coming
[1:05:36] through calvary coming through that
[1:05:38] blood atonement
[1:05:39] into fellowship with god and then
[1:05:43] the next part is joy peace
[1:05:47] patience long suffering these fruits
[1:05:50] they're not
[1:05:51] lesser than faith they're of equal
[1:05:53] importance
[1:05:55] so you can be a stalwart faithful
[1:05:57] believer and have no joy
[1:05:59] you're you're actually not claiming a
[1:06:01] very big part of your inheritance
[1:06:04] you can have faith and you're going to
[1:06:05] heaven and you're saved
[1:06:07] but got no patience or peace they're
[1:06:10] just as important
[1:06:12] but joy joy and i speak on it every time
[1:06:15] because i think it's important joy is
[1:06:17] what you draw waters from the wells of
[1:06:18] salvation
[1:06:20] without joy you ain't drawing no
[1:06:21] strength you're just walking around
[1:06:23] morbid flat you
[1:06:27] you you might be sealed in your soul but
[1:06:30] your spirit and your flesh is just
[1:06:32] flat walking around depressed down
[1:06:36] oh my long hair and long face
[1:06:40] short hair and short temper
[1:06:44] fight a buzzsaw you know all these
[1:06:46] things
[1:06:48] because you're not bringing leadership
[1:06:51] in your own life
[1:06:53] and if you're going to rule and reign in
[1:06:54] an earth governing over normal people in
[1:06:57] real
[1:06:57] and flesh and governing and earth and
[1:06:59] cities
[1:07:00] then you need the lord is going to raise
[1:07:02] you up break those cycles in your life
[1:07:04] that's hindering you
[1:07:05] so that you can rule and reign over
[1:07:07] yourself
[1:07:09] and be a not a malevolent leader
[1:07:12] don't be a malevolent leader over your
[1:07:14] flesh and spirit
[1:07:16] don't rule with bondage and pharisaic
[1:07:19] style leadership but give your spirit
[1:07:23] and flesh something to live for
[1:07:25] amen die i'll tell you that it's all
[1:07:29] simple
[1:07:30] you just need to die to self self is the
[1:07:32] veil
[1:07:33] that hides the glory of god within your
[1:07:35] own heart
[1:07:36] because you may be sealed into the day
[1:07:38] of redemption and your soul is saved as
[1:07:40] save can be
[1:07:41] but your flesh is not dead and you're
[1:07:43] just
[1:07:44] hiding it all in and it's all just stuck
[1:07:47] in
[1:07:47] but tonight you can leave different
[1:07:50] tonight you can say
[1:07:51] there is a cycle breaker in here that
[1:07:53] can help me die to myself
[1:07:55] so i'm the selfishness and all about me
[1:07:58] it's just like gravity you know babies
[1:07:59] are
[1:08:00] but by the time they're conceived
[1:08:01] they're already sucking
[1:08:03] excuse the language but they're just
[1:08:05] sucking things in and the mother wants
[1:08:07] this and what's that and what's this
[1:08:08] and it's just drawing drawing drawing
[1:08:11] and
[1:08:12] more mark comes out crying and it's just
[1:08:14] all about that baby
[1:08:15] and they grow up and they're selfish
[1:08:17] children it's all about me and
[1:08:18] they don't care they're not thankful
[1:08:21] children be thankful
[1:08:24] it's true they don't realize what
[1:08:25] they've got they don't realize the
[1:08:27] preciousness of life
[1:08:28] until one day god comes
[1:08:32] to meet them and when you receive the
[1:08:34] new birth
[1:08:35] that selfishness gets destroyed that
[1:08:38] spirit
[1:08:39] that human spirit gets subdued and you
[1:08:41] begin to give
[1:08:43] hallelujah that's a general statement
[1:08:46] there are people around that are
[1:08:47] unconverted that are very unselfish
[1:08:50] but you see what i'm talking about it's
[1:08:52] just a principle of humanity
[1:08:54] the human flesh it's just selfish
[1:08:58] and it's that veil that will hide god
[1:09:00] within you
[1:09:02] it's that veil that will keep
[1:09:05] others from benefiting out of your life
[1:09:08] but if that veil just gets
[1:09:09] die killed dead on the altar
[1:09:12] elijah came what did he do he made an
[1:09:14] altar so that you can fall on it
[1:09:16] so that fire can come down and break it
[1:09:19] so that you can live and really live for
[1:09:21] others
[1:09:21] eternal life is living for others right
[1:09:25] amen so there has to be a death to self
[1:09:29] to break that flesh veil out of your own
[1:09:31] life so that it can release what
[1:09:34] the glory of god to conquer the enemy
[1:09:37] you can't destroy your own flesh because
[1:09:39] that'll be committing suicide
[1:09:41] you can't do that and you can't destroy
[1:09:43] your own spirit and end up in a great
[1:09:44] depression
[1:09:46] because that's what happens when you put
[1:09:47] yourself through torture and stress and
[1:09:50] all those things because you do things
[1:09:53] die to self let self die
[1:09:57] paul die daily what does that mean ask
[1:09:59] god i don't know
[1:10:00] i don't know how it's just something you
[1:10:02] have to do
[1:10:03] it's something you have to it's between
[1:10:05] you and the lord it's like a you know
[1:10:07] like a consecration it's a
[1:10:08] it's an attitude it's just it's
[1:10:11] fellowship
[1:10:13] that's the self
[1:10:18] hallelujah brother branham said
[1:10:20] desperation
[1:10:22] a lack of desperation is because of a
[1:10:24] lack of the love of god
[1:10:29] so if you find yourself just not really
[1:10:32] concerned
[1:10:35] you know it says you know because
[1:10:39] the prophet was us he said how do and um
[1:10:42] perfect faith he talked about
[1:10:44] developing having a real love for god
[1:10:46] and he says you've got to really
[1:10:47] meditate on
[1:10:48] what he's done for you you've got to
[1:10:50] begin to start thinking about your hero
[1:10:53] think of him differently he is your
[1:10:55] savior
[1:10:56] but make him your hero children
[1:11:00] make him your hero you know what he did
[1:11:05] he he took everything
[1:11:09] he took all of his own life he took it
[1:11:11] all he took all of our sins he took
[1:11:13] everything
[1:11:14] and he took it upon himself so that we
[1:11:16] could be his friend
[1:11:17] he's a hero i don't want to go down that
[1:11:20] route
[1:11:21] and preach too far on that but i just
[1:11:24] want you to realize that if if you find
[1:11:26] yourself
[1:11:27] lacking in his love or you feel like
[1:11:29] it's just like a duty
[1:11:31] your christianity becomes just a duty
[1:11:34] you know you honor god and you come to
[1:11:36] church it's an honor it's like a
[1:11:37] valiance
[1:11:38] you know you want to be a gallant
[1:11:39] soldier of christ and and yet that love
[1:11:42] isn't there
[1:11:43] my i said it makes a huge difference and
[1:11:46] you see now says begin to meditate upon
[1:11:49] the things he's done for you how he
[1:11:51] found you in darkness
[1:11:52] and he found you somewhere in some hole
[1:11:55] found you in some drug or some
[1:11:57] depression or some bottle some alcoholic
[1:12:00] condition
[1:12:01] he found you there but you're not there
[1:12:04] now
[1:12:05] who did that for you who took you from
[1:12:09] that
[1:12:10] somebody that loved you someone that
[1:12:13] really loves you
[1:12:14] that cares about your soul
[1:12:18] on the other hand there's another person
[1:12:21] that hates you
[1:12:23] who is this devil anyway this one
[1:12:27] that is you're called to tear down out
[1:12:29] of his lying position
[1:12:31] and make him real lying lying on the
[1:12:33] ground of your life
[1:12:36] don't have him lying in your head by
[1:12:38] lies have him lying on the ground
[1:12:40] underneath your feet that's where he
[1:12:42] belongs
[1:12:44] either way he's lying one is lying there
[1:12:47] or he's lying here
[1:12:48] amen
[1:12:53] i have to read this 14 because i just
[1:12:54] want to get to the next part and then
[1:12:56] we're going to pray
[1:12:57] it says here and we're going to skip
[1:12:59] from 7 down to 12 it says
[1:13:02] and i want you to realize as i've made
[1:13:04] this background
[1:13:05] with the millennium but actually in your
[1:13:08] own life
[1:13:09] you taste this now of a complete victory
[1:13:12] in your own earth
[1:13:13] a subduing of the flesh and the spirit
[1:13:15] by love
[1:13:16] by god's love by subduing you can't
[1:13:19] destroy it
[1:13:20] it's going to be destroyed it's going to
[1:13:22] be changed one day but
[1:13:24] at the moment you've got to live with
[1:13:26] these two parts of your own being which
[1:13:28] is unconverted
[1:13:30] and how you rule those is going to
[1:13:32] dictate how you would
[1:13:34] potentially rule in the millennium
[1:13:36] because the way your leadership style
[1:13:39] now if you take your leadership style in
[1:13:41] your own life and
[1:13:42] pattern it after some old school
[1:13:45] victorian rule way you've got another
[1:13:48] thing coming
[1:13:49] you have to rethink your leadership
[1:13:52] rethink
[1:13:53] the style because that's not the jesus
[1:13:54] style
[1:13:56] jesus style is perfect love jesus style
[1:13:59] is led by the spirit of god
[1:14:01] jesus style as the captain says how to
[1:14:03] release rahab
[1:14:04] completely different it's not logical
[1:14:06] but it's jesus
[1:14:08] it's his way it's his vision it's his
[1:14:10] prophecy
[1:14:11] it's him he gives you specific
[1:14:13] instruction
[1:14:14] and that's the the wisdom of god and as
[1:14:17] you walk
[1:14:18] that wisdom of god will begin to
[1:14:21] amalgamate in your own life
[1:14:23] and you will begin to have the wisdom of
[1:14:25] god
[1:14:26] and you'll have the mind of christ and
[1:14:28] it just merges into you
[1:14:29] and you begin to think like him and
[1:14:31] eventually one day
[1:14:32] everything you think will be the way he
[1:14:34] thinks and then he will release to you
[1:14:36] all the power of heaven and earth
[1:14:38] and you will be able to speak and it
[1:14:39] will happen and that stuff is already in
[1:14:41] you
[1:14:42] but he's you're just you're just not
[1:14:44] ready for it we're not ready but
[1:14:45] the thing is we're going through things
[1:14:47] to make us ready and we've been given
[1:14:49] promises to re
[1:14:50] to take that liar and bring him down
[1:14:55] how art thou fallen from heaven o
[1:14:57] lucifer
[1:14:58] out of my life out of my mind out of my
[1:15:01] flesh how aren't thou fallen oh lucifer
[1:15:05] oh my i want you to make this personal
[1:15:07] son of the morning
[1:15:08] how are thou cut down to the ground
[1:15:10] which did weaken the nation which stood
[1:15:12] weak in my life which did weaken my
[1:15:15] testimony
[1:15:15] which did weaken my fatherhood which did
[1:15:18] weaken my
[1:15:18] sisterhood which did weaken my
[1:15:21] friendship which should hinder me
[1:15:23] who was it lucifer how art thou
[1:15:27] fallen from heaven all of his influences
[1:15:29] all of these things that you inherited
[1:15:31] and
[1:15:31] behaviors that you saw a movie that
[1:15:33] impressed your life
[1:15:35] or some person said something to you and
[1:15:37] it's caused you to
[1:15:38] live under that bondage hard bondage
[1:15:42] but tonight you can be free tonight you
[1:15:45] can say no more devil
[1:15:47] because how art thou fallen oh lucifer
[1:15:51] hallelujah sorry i don't mean to shout
[1:15:53] but it just comes out like that
[1:15:54] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[1:15:57] ascend into heaven
[1:15:58] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:16:00] of god you are the stars
[1:16:03] he wants to exalt his throne above you
[1:16:06] that's his intention he wants to rule
[1:16:08] hell in your head
[1:16:09] it's the only way because he doesn't
[1:16:11] have a intrinsic
[1:16:13] position he doesn't have a given state
[1:16:16] he lost it
[1:16:17] he lost his first estate right and now
[1:16:19] the only way you can get back into a
[1:16:20] throne is by in the human mind
[1:16:24] only way but you have the power tonight
[1:16:27] little children if the devil gives you
[1:16:29] an evil thought
[1:16:31] you can say i cast you down in the name
[1:16:32] of jesus christ
[1:16:34] and he has to listen you can tear him
[1:16:37] down
[1:16:38] who likes to tear down the devil amen
[1:16:42] if he's annoying you you can cast him
[1:16:44] down
[1:16:45] and you know what we're called to cast
[1:16:47] the devil down
[1:16:48] we're called to cast him out cast him
[1:16:50] down kick him
[1:16:51] whatever you need to do to get rid of
[1:16:53] him because
[1:16:54] hey he's going to try he's going to
[1:16:56] continue to attempt
[1:16:58] to rule he doesn't want to lose he
[1:16:59] doesn't want to be under your feet do
[1:17:00] you think he likes lying down there
[1:17:02] and and being subservient to a just a
[1:17:05] regular joe
[1:17:06] you know just us average people no
[1:17:11] he doesn't like that and he'll do
[1:17:12] everything in his power to try and stop
[1:17:14] it
[1:17:15] for thou has said in my heart read there
[1:17:17] thrown above the stars of god i will sit
[1:17:20] also upon the mount of the congregation
[1:17:22] in the sides of the north i will ascend
[1:17:24] above the heights of the clouds
[1:17:25] i will be like the most high yet thou
[1:17:28] shalt be brought down to hell
[1:17:30] to the sides of the pit they that see
[1:17:32] thee
[1:17:33] this is where i wanted to get to they
[1:17:35] that see thee
[1:17:36] shall narrowly look upon thee and
[1:17:38] consider thee saying
[1:17:40] is this the man that made the earth to
[1:17:43] tremble
[1:17:44] is it him really all of a sudden
[1:17:47] the people realize that he's nothing
[1:17:51] after all these years of catering to him
[1:17:54] harbouring him in their lives worshiping
[1:17:57] inadvertently not realizing it these
[1:17:59] complexes that he's brought
[1:18:01] living under his depressions living
[1:18:03] under his addictions
[1:18:05] living under all this evil living under
[1:18:08] his
[1:18:08] his lies to to destroy teenage years you
[1:18:11] know i
[1:18:12] really believe that a teenager doesn't
[1:18:13] have to live under the bondage of the
[1:18:15] enemy with ups and downs and emotions
[1:18:17] this and that and everything
[1:18:18] they can be stable they can be full of
[1:18:20] joy they can be
[1:18:21] full of the holy ghost and serving god
[1:18:24] you know brother tim pruitt was a pastor
[1:18:25] at 14 years old
[1:18:27] leading people come on
[1:18:30] why because he got serious with god
[1:18:34] do you know samuel was probably leading
[1:18:36] israel
[1:18:37] at 14 years old i don't know but it
[1:18:39] wasn't him
[1:18:40] and it wasn't brother tim it was god it
[1:18:43] was god
[1:18:45] and i just pray right now lord help me
[1:18:48] i just pray if you're in that place it
[1:18:51] doesn't matter how old you are
[1:18:53] i may be cornering teenagers and i love
[1:18:55] you
[1:18:57] but we're all teenagers we're all going
[1:18:58] to be 18. we're all kind of 18 on the
[1:19:00] inside
[1:19:01] but i just want to say that in you is a
[1:19:04] calling
[1:19:05] in you a purpose
[1:19:09] a real divine purpose in you as officers
[1:19:13] of motherhood sisterhood some ministry
[1:19:16] some
[1:19:16] some some expression now when god gets a
[1:19:20] hold of that
[1:19:22] amen what you were born for and what you
[1:19:24] were made for and what fits you like a
[1:19:25] glove
[1:19:26] will come out of you and you will go
[1:19:29] i am here i've arrived thank you jesus
[1:19:32] and he begins to work and that's what
[1:19:35] you're made for
[1:19:36] and i just pray may god enable you i
[1:19:39] don't want to look at people but may god
[1:19:40] enable you
[1:19:42] you know sometimes i like you know
[1:19:44] because we know each other so well
[1:19:45] it's different when you're preaching in
[1:19:46] your home church because you know
[1:19:48] everybody
[1:19:49] so well you know and it's like yeah you
[1:19:52] don't want to look at people but you
[1:19:53] know you see
[1:19:54] there is i just pray god enable
[1:19:57] you know there's been a burden on my
[1:19:58] heart and i don't know how i mean it's
[1:20:01] only the lord that can do it but
[1:20:02] you see god is never going to override
[1:20:04] your will
[1:20:05] the lord is never going to like
[1:20:08] just come in and intrude but he wants to
[1:20:12] enable you
[1:20:13] he wants to take those gifts in your
[1:20:14] life and and operate through them
[1:20:18] so much that a 14 year old man boy
[1:20:21] teenager whatever
[1:20:24] can pastor a church you tell me
[1:20:28] who's 14 here is anyone 14 nine fourteen
[1:20:32] how josh you're 13 a so can you imagine
[1:20:36] josh maybe
[1:20:37] probably is three heads taller because
[1:20:39] he's probably going to grow three heads
[1:20:40] in this year
[1:20:41] but but
[1:20:45] can you imagine josh being our pastor
[1:20:48] this is this is what god can do god can
[1:20:52] do that
[1:20:53] and here we are you know thinking we're
[1:20:55] still young and just got to have a bit
[1:20:57] of good time but
[1:20:58] actually we've got to be serious we can
[1:21:00] have fun there's nothing wrong with
[1:21:01] having fun
[1:21:02] but there is a real seriousness that is
[1:21:05] required
[1:21:06] you know it says that we should um
[1:21:10] live a life that's worthy of the gospel
[1:21:12] of peace
[1:21:14] and it's not a legalistic thing that's
[1:21:16] as a love affair
[1:21:22] for thou it says here they shall
[1:21:25] see thee they that see they shall
[1:21:28] narrowly look upon thee and consider
[1:21:30] thee
[1:21:30] saying is this the man that made the
[1:21:32] earth to tremble
[1:21:33] and doubt that did you shake the
[1:21:36] kingdoms
[1:21:37] that made the world as a wilderness what
[1:21:39] do you do
[1:21:41] this is that one this guy you know this
[1:21:44] fallen angel
[1:21:46] he did all this this is the one
[1:21:49] that's taking family
[1:21:52] causing all sorts of crazy stuff to
[1:21:54] happen in your family to destroy your
[1:21:55] family
[1:21:56] taking your friends making your friends
[1:21:58] commit suicide
[1:21:59] you know doing all these evil things
[1:22:02] taking your joy
[1:22:04] making you depressed making you resort
[1:22:06] to
[1:22:07] human things to try and cope taking your
[1:22:10] children
[1:22:11] putting them in the world and destroy
[1:22:14] trying to destroy their lives
[1:22:15] trying to destroy your life trying to
[1:22:17] kill your body give you cancers
[1:22:20] who likes this guy does anyone like him
[1:22:22] or does everyone just completely
[1:22:24] just want to say i hate you devil
[1:22:28] this is you know the prophet says this
[1:22:29] and i want to read this and we're about
[1:22:30] to close
[1:22:31] he says here he says
[1:22:34] he says god rebuke that devil
[1:22:38] that's hindering you beautiful little
[1:22:39] girls may the power that raised jesus
[1:22:42] from the grave
[1:22:43] cast that thing away never bother you no
[1:22:46] more
[1:22:46] i say that on the authority of god's
[1:22:48] word you have to get angry at the devil
[1:22:52] this is the one that's trying to destroy
[1:22:55] your life that's trying to question your
[1:22:56] identity that's trying to take you from
[1:22:58] christianity that's trying to take your
[1:23:00] mind
[1:23:00] you know especially when you're going
[1:23:02] through your life change and you become
[1:23:03] you know from like the age of about 12
[1:23:06] through to
[1:23:06] you know 17 18. you know he's going to
[1:23:09] try and take your identity
[1:23:11] and he's going to try and make you
[1:23:12] rethink who you are he's going to try
[1:23:14] and steal you
[1:23:15] from your position steal you from your
[1:23:19] families trying to
[1:23:20] make you upset and give you depression
[1:23:22] and and bring you down and all of us we
[1:23:24] are in the same boat
[1:23:25] this is the one and i want you to
[1:23:28] realize
[1:23:29] that tonight he is our enemy and tonight
[1:23:32] when we pray
[1:23:33] i want you to address him i want you to
[1:23:36] really address him for who he is
[1:23:38] and what he's done in your life just
[1:23:40] think about that and
[1:23:41] and and bring him down because you see
[1:23:44] what we
[1:23:44] read there is a reality that is a
[1:23:47] prophecy that this one our jesus who has
[1:23:49] come down
[1:23:50] in this generation to destroy the works
[1:23:54] of the devil completely so that you
[1:23:57] can be completely free
[1:24:04] let's stand can i have the musicians
[1:24:14] please
[1:24:22] let's sing all riser hallelujah
[1:24:39] just think this one
[1:24:42] that's caused all this trouble over all
[1:24:44] these years
[1:24:45] and back through your family generations
[1:24:47] has just been crushing your
[1:24:49] lineage and destroying and taking your
[1:24:52] loved ones to hell
[1:24:54] he's not going to take you to hell and
[1:24:56] he's not going to take your children to
[1:24:57] hell because the cycle breaker is here
[1:25:00] and now with this in mind i want you to
[1:25:02] pray tonight as we sing this song
[1:25:04] after we sing the song i want you to
[1:25:05] pray and i want you to really
[1:25:08] think about that this one that has
[1:25:11] destroyed
[1:25:12] all these generations and turned the
[1:25:13] world into a wilderness
[1:25:15] no more no more
[1:25:18] stand tonight with us we're going to
[1:25:20] pray together and we're going to bring
[1:25:22] our faith together and we're going to
[1:25:23] address that one
[1:25:26] remember what was read he was brought
[1:25:29] down
[1:25:30] he was fallen from heaven he was cast
[1:25:32] down from heaven
[1:25:34] and he's tried to rise up in humanity
[1:25:36] but he is being cast out of a bride
[1:25:38] because a bride has received a
[1:25:40] declaration of independence
[1:25:42] because a mighty angel came down with an
[1:25:44] open book in his hand
[1:25:45] and then that open book it said you are
[1:25:47] free you don't have to be under that
[1:25:49] anymore
[1:25:50] here is your inheritance saints here it
[1:25:52] says freedom to you
[1:25:54] here it says no more slavery here it
[1:25:56] says broken cycles
[1:25:57] here it says full and complete healing
[1:26:00] complete healing for everything all your
[1:26:04] tempers
[1:26:04] all your complexes all the darkness that
[1:26:06] would try and destroy your
[1:26:08] testimony all free it's all in here
[1:26:11] and he must obey it he
[1:26:14] must conform to the word hallelujah
[1:26:18] and so tonight i i i encourage you the
[1:26:22] same captain that said how to free rahab
[1:26:24] was the same captain that gave all the
[1:26:26] orders all the way through to the elect
[1:26:28] seat
[1:26:29] to give instruction and righteousness to
[1:26:31] show them exactly what to do in the
[1:26:33] situation
[1:26:34] and tonight you may be facing a
[1:26:35] situation to you may be facing something
[1:26:37] that you don't understand
[1:26:39] and you can't under figure it out but
[1:26:41] tonight
[1:26:43] god can come down and pray through you
[1:26:45] and give you instruction
[1:26:47] and maybe something's been spoken
[1:26:48] tonight that's given you instruction
[1:26:50] and you may be looking down the barrel
[1:26:52] of impossibilities but you are
[1:26:54] omnipotent
[1:26:55] and when you as an omnipotent man or a
[1:26:57] woman meet the omnipotence of god
[1:27:00] he will release the miraculous upon that
[1:27:02] impossible thing that you're looking at
[1:27:04] tonight
[1:27:04] so i want you to declare to the
[1:27:06] impossible thing that you think
[1:27:08] is impossible god specializes in that
[1:27:11] god will deliver you god will save your
[1:27:14] family he will save you
[1:27:15] he will redeem you out of it the things
[1:27:18] that you think is impossible
[1:27:19] do not be wary in well-doing for we have
[1:27:23] a declaration of independence
[1:27:25] we have a word that has come in this
[1:27:27] generation
[1:27:28] amen do you believe that hallelujah why
[1:27:31] let's play
[1:27:32] play softly i'll raise the hallelujah
[1:27:34] amen
[1:27:36] amen as you're playing i want you to
[1:27:41] listen to this quote as we see this
[1:27:44] pressure coming on it says the prophet
[1:27:46] says it's tightening
[1:27:47] and then when that time comes and the
[1:27:49] press comes to a place
[1:27:51] where you're pressed out then watch what
[1:27:54] i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes
[1:27:56] watch the third pull then see and it'll
[1:27:59] be
[1:28:00] absolutely to the total lost but it will
[1:28:02] be
[1:28:03] for the bride
[1:28:07] and the church now we are closer than it
[1:28:10] seems to be
[1:28:11] i don't know when but it's real real
[1:28:13] close
[1:28:14] amen who believes we're coming right
[1:28:16] into it
[1:28:18] amen hallelujah
[1:28:21] i may be building a platform for
[1:28:22] somebody else to step on
[1:28:25] i may be taken before that time i don't
[1:28:27] know and tonight as we pray out as we
[1:28:30] sing the song
[1:28:32] i just i just want you to open your
[1:28:34] heart to the lord and say lord
[1:28:36] you're that one that the prophet made a
[1:28:38] platform for
[1:28:39] lord i want you the one that spoke in
[1:28:41] that prayer meeting in stokes valley
[1:28:43] that said i will draw my people into my
[1:28:45] rest
[1:28:46] that one that one i want you to just to
[1:28:50] realize that he
[1:28:51] is the one that the prophet introduced
[1:28:54] [Music]

[1:28:57] doctrine we were a person
[1:28:59] what came on the scene in his full
[1:29:02] measure
