thoughts of nervousness and did all Jesus unrest I pray that they'd just be done away with Lord that we could just have peace in your Holy Spirit Lord and be blessed I pray I thank you Lord and the wonderful name of Lord Jesus Christ to pray amen amen always standing if we could just um open open our Bibles to Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 through I would go to verse one and the title I'm going to title this the service the almighty God that we serve amen so if we go to Genesis 1 chapter 1 verse 1 it says here in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light amen so our almighty God created the Heaven and the Earth people everything that we see around us all the trees everything there was a God Almighty who created all of it amen I found that so powerful and I was saying to myself that I was like you know I think oh I did a little Garden in order for this to happen I'll need a little bit of a miracle you know or something great like that and then I was there was like a frame of myself when I was a little child and I thought my goodness I got born how incredible what what a miracle that was you know I actually I'm here you know I was I was born I was like right and then if we could turn to um Genesis chapter 2 and we'll go to verse seven and it says and the Lord formed the man of the Dust of the ground that's quite powerful I can't I've never seen anybody take up you know to go to Stanford and you like get up things handfuls of sand you know nobody's ever you know God Almighty did that but it turned into somebody you know it turned into you and I am in how powerful I meant man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life and Man became a living soul I mean that's very powerful and then if we could go to Second Peter and we'll go um chapter three foreign Peter chapter three and we'll go to verse 13. and it says here and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that I'm on the right that's what uh second paid off chapter three sorry I'm on chapter two and says here nevertheless we according to his promise look for the new heavens and a new Earth where indwelleth righteousness amen so this the Earth that the Lord created you know at the moment it's not the nicest place to live you know there's wars and rumors of wars and stuff but our great golden Mighty is going to is going to create a new heavens and a new Earth amen amen amen your mouth have your seats now I've I've found that quite powerful you know that our Lord God you know because I sometimes think you know this Earth is just a place of suffering you know I just go to work and you know it's hard for me and I sweat and you know but the Lord is creating a greater place for this amen I like how dad says you know we'll struggle on this and on on this in this Earth but you know there's coming a new heavens and the Earth where we're gonna all rest I mean it's going to be an awesome awesome and awesome place and it's going to be forever you know it's going to be eternity we're never going to leave that awesome place I mean it's never going to stop amen now for a good turn to um John chapter 14. let's go John chapter 14. and we'll go to verse 17. and we now want to talk about you know the god the Lord didn't just make this Earth and just he didn't just make us and leave us here amen he comes and dwells in US I mean he's always with us I mean the Lord God never leaves us and it says here in verse 17 even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it Seth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you aiming how powerful the god of who created everything comes and live in us and we know that in order to for the Lord to come dwell in us we must be filled with the Holy Ghost amen and then once we have filled the holy ghost in the um uh sorry once we baptized we shall receive the Holy Ghost so after we're baptized then the Lord can come and live inside us and we are made into new creatures amen and the Lord Jesus amen but but you know in order for the Lord to come live inside us we can't you know um out we need to we need it's like the lord it's like we're like our our bodies are like a house for the Lord you know once we have the Holy Ghost the Lord can then dwell in us you know who wants to go on to a house that's messy and you know run down and people have thrown their letter everywhere you know it wouldn't be very nice and go to your lounge and there's all that there's no furniture no or something like that you're not wouldn't want to be you know but we need to have a house furnished you know and everything needs to be nice for the Lord you know maybe when he goes to make guys into the kitchen maybe there's food food already made for him you know opens up the pantry and there's all food I mean it needs to be clean so if we go to our first Corinthians we'll go to um chapter three so First Corinthians chapter three and we'll go verse 17. says here if any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple ye are I mean so it just States here you know God the Lord doesn't like a temple that's been all you know littered upon you know maybe you know that's been been run down amen we need to look after ourselves I mean we need to morning and night we should well this is just for me you know I need to pray and read my Bible you know and we should always be feasting on the Lord to make our temples you know more holy be filled with more of the Lord amen and I was thinking um I mean even myself you know I was um you know I wasn't probably wasn't then I was definitely a very messy house for the Lord at one stage you know but then been thousand hours I'm I remember I was I wasn't I was on this fan and I was it was night time and I was sitting there and then the Lord told me you know play Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound and I was like oh yes and then I started playing it and in My Hope because you know I thought I was going to hell at that stage you know and then um started playing Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound and then the Lord just came and met me in the van and I was like that I was changed I could see things properly and everything changed for me I mean [Music] I mean and you know now the Lord lives inside me so the very same Lord Jesus who died on the cross now lives inside of me and then he came and changed changed my life around I mean I thought you know how powerful when I was I mean when I was a little boy I'd always used to ask the Lord deal of God please you know please come film with the Holy Ghost and I believe we know at that stage of fight if I died I would have probably Gone to Heaven because you know my life was my life was right you know I was doing anything right but then you know I didn't feel any different I thought oh my but I have to look back I think you know I wonder if the Lord took me through all that stuff just so I could be filled the Holy Ghost just so he could answer you know the the longing that I was that I was you know wanting and I just think I'm so thankful of the Lord that when the new heavens and youth come I'll be there amen you're going to see David Lee walking the streets of gold event shouting glory amen glory to God Amen now you know the law doesn't just come and um doesn't just come live in us the Lord leads us amen we we are LED we are LED of the Lord now you know we look at the prophet um brother Branham you know he got he he was very LED of the Lord like um someone was saying oh I think it's he he was um he was going he was going to go um B he just want to go live in the wilderness and go hunting and stuff and then the Lord I think the Lord showed him there were two people two two people on the street and they they were very broke just living you know I don't think that I think they might have been homeless and the Lord said you know if you go and do and go up in the wilderness I'll make you like these people amen by that you know the Lord you know the Lord let him the Lord showed him those things so that he wouldn't go and do that you know so he would stay ministering the word he went over to Africa you know who just goes over to Africa you know doesn't you know it's not a very nice place from what to say I could say you know you could go get killed and stuff oh my goodness you know I'd rather stay in America in a nice in a nice place you know nice nice food I mean but you know he went over to Africa and started ministering under people that you know that's that's the Lord leading someone I believe I mean even me you know I used to smoke and drink and do all this evilness you know the Lord led me away from those things but you know the Lord you know and but you know the law can lead in the in the big things and the Lord can also lead in the small things I have a little little bit of testimony I was um I went down to the beach one day and the work van and you know the work Van's only rear wheel drive so I can get stuck quite easily anyway as I was driving down I lost the track oh no I'll go to the side there was like this little side route so I went around there and then I got stuck in the work van on the beach oh my I was like oh it's all right because there's there was a truck parked up and I was like oh so right you know there's a full drive I'll just quickly hop out of my van and go ask this guy and I don't really want to I was like now I'll just have to go to it so I went went up and I got within 50 meters of the sky and then this voice told me to not go back and go back to your van and sudden I thought you know this is this is going Beyond logic you know I should just go quickly ask this guy to tow me out and then I'm gone you know and I got 50 meters he could probably see me walk up to the van I was like oh no so I just turned around and walked back to my van and Hopton and about two months later I thought that was the weirdest thing we've done now I want to hop back out and quickly go go get him and then the first time again he said nope stay here and he I don't he the voice said I don't care if you stay here till midnight stay here because I have a phone to me I couldn't ring you why not I was like I'm just gonna sudden you know Ponder upon the thoughts of the Lord until midnight and um and then anyways about probably about five minutes later there was a truck come past and he was Towing someone so someone else had got stuck and he was tying him out I said oh you know this guy's got a toe rope and the truck I'll just he's going to come past me I'll just quickly go stop him before he drives on so I hopped out and he came past excuse me I I'm I got stuck he's like oh no quick I'll just unhook this guy and then I'll come pull you out oh thanks man you know I'm out of here five minutes later you know thank you Lord anyway so you unhook me he was going to tell me he's like yeah um yeah a lot of people getting stuck today um I've just got this follow-out and then someone's gonna have to go get that fellow out too and it was the dude I was walking up to he was actually stuck I mean so yeah if I walked out from God I wouldn't have gotten too much help so yeah in our Bibles we'll just go to First Kings and First Kings chapter 18. and we will go verse one and it says here and it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah on the third year saying go show thyself unto Ahab and I will send rain upon the Earth and then if we go down to verse 4 it was so that when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord the Obadiah took a hundred and hundred profits and hid them buy 50 in a cave and fed them with bread and water and Ahab said answer Obadiah go into the land unto all Fountains of water unto all Brock's pre-adventure we might find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts amen so what's happened here is as this this was a season of drought and we all know um I trust we will read through kings that what what's what's happened is Elijah's Elijah said there was going to be a famine amen so now now Ahab as as you know he's king of Israel and there's a big family in the land amen so I have probably wouldn't be too happy you know because and and he probably wouldn't be too happy at Elijah either because Elijah said there was going to be a a famine and um and also Jezebel was killing all the prophets amen and Elijah was a prophet so the Lord is telling Elijah go to Ahab you know even and if Elijah if Elijah looked at that with his logic he might have thought I'm going to go die you know and men end up you know if that was a worldly person I believe they would have thought I know I'm going to go die I want to go do something else you know but the Lord told Elijah you must go there and if we could go to chapter sorry verse 15. it says here and um so so now Obadiah has come to Elijah and his Elijah has told Obadiah I need you to go to Ahab before before me and tell him that I'm going to go see him I mean and and CeCe here and Elijah said as the Lord of host Lilith before whom I stand I will surely show myself unto him that day and so Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet Elijah and it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth Israel I mean so Ahab wasn't even very happy amen but Elijah still went Elijah still went to Ahab I mean even though he could have died he'd still win I mean so I thought that you know what what an example for me you know he's a man who's about to die and we all know how Elijah died he did not die amen he the Chariots of Fire took Elijah away I mean so I think for myself you know if the Lord tells me to do something I must do it you know I mean but I thought you know how how powerful and then if we could turn go to Jonah chapter one so if we could go to Jonah I trust me on another story I'm just going to read these verses quickly now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of am matai saying arise go to none of that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me but Jonah arose up to flea and tutashus from the presence of the Lord and went down to Joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fear thereof and went down into it to go up with them in tutashus from the presence of the Lord now I found the story very interesting because you know it's I almost feel like there'll be a question of you know how do I know that the Lord's talking to me or how do I know where the Lord's going to lead me I mean well I look at the story of Jonah I think to myself I don't think Jonah could help but be led by the Lord and when he tried to go he tried to go go somewhere else and still and we if we read on the story we'll find that you know Jonah got swallowed up by a big fish so Jonah actually couldn't go anywhere amen the Lord so you know we shouldn't question oh dear Lord you know well you can um the Lord can um how do I know where to go amen but if the Lord really wants you to do something I believe you'll end up doing it at the end of the day you will fulfill that you know if the Lord really wants to adore you it's you know like you'll be like Jonah who couldn't help but be led amen but you know in order to be led by the law in a deeper way you know we must die to ourselves daily we must die to the our flesh daily you know to have a have a closer walk with the Lord so the Lord can have more of a pool so we can you know enter into the Lord's presence more and that voice that the Lord's voice will become clearer amen that can you know because you know I like how I think this brother man keeps saying you know we shouldn't always be watching YouTube I mean don't always be hearing YouTube's voice because it might drown out the voice of the Lord eventually you know if you keep watching it too much there's a nice balance you know you'd learn quite a few handful things on YouTube but you can't you know always listen to YouTube I mean you want to hear the that that sweet that sweet voice of the Lord amen and now I want to go to Romans we're going to turn on Bible to Romans chapter six so go Romans chapter six and we'll go to verse 23. it says here for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ amen so just just to just to finish here on you know we have eternal life I'm in the I was read this again for the wages of sun is death but the gift of God is eternal life you know there's Assad space it's like there's two choices to choose from you could choose the wages of death which is um sin but you'll you'll die or you could choose the gift of God's eternal life you know but you know you must die to yourself daily I mean you must live in the ways of the Lord but I'll sing to myself you know I was thinking oh you know I wonder who I'm going to see up there in eternity and you know I remember um I think it was you know brother Andy's sister Ron you know they had um I think when their first child was you know had a fatal that had a fatal death you know but I believe you know we're going to see her up in glory because sister Brahman had a dream Angie saw she saw um here off in glory I mean so how cool is that gonna be okay amen and then I was you know we all um we all know that um brother Branham he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw I think he saw um his wife hope and his his daughter and you know um and he said we cannot miss it we have to be there amen so you know even if there's like you know I find myself often you know this life is a struggle you know I knew the desires of the flesh can pull you one way but you know you have to be there so even if your desires or your flesh try to grab you I mean you must be an eternity I mean you know I mean and you know I was also I was also thinking um my grandpa he died a while ago when I think I was about seven and we were back in Gisborne and Mum was you know she wasn't very happy she said oh my you know my grandpa's dead we didn't go to the the funeral or anything so you know I don't I don't really know what happened but I hope that he's going to be up there in glory too amen and my mum we used to go to like pack and save and go shopping and go shopping with her and I remember her telling one of the the people who was on the tellers this lady she's like um when I get to heaven I know I believe my Grandpa's gonna my dad is going to come back from the dead oh my you know is that something here every day I mean but but you know and I was thinking to myself I thought oh my if grandpa has has gone into eternity he might come back with the Saints amen so he might actually come back mum you know how that'd be awesome so grandpargan I mean and and just just one thing as I as I close that actually it was by the brother brother Chris Gershon told me I found it quite powerful for myself it says I he this is why she said to me he said um because I I was questioning a couple things and he said you should always be growing in the Lord you know and you should never you should he said you should never just as you grow you know you come to points where you just Plateau along and you know you get a bit lazy and you know if you're if you're you're diligently seeking the Lord you know it's all it's very good too you know but he said you must just always ground the Lord if you find yourself come to a point where you're just plateauing along and you'll walk with the Lord he said start going upwards again you know and I found that quite powerful I was like oh my yes amen so I trust you're all truly blessed um I want to call Josh back up but I mean God richly may the Lord richly bless you all [Applause] amen I like that Dave that was cool well then why don't we sing what a mighty God we serve [Music] What a Mighty God [Music] almighty God angels [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'll sing and praise the Lord amen praise the Lord thank you thanks Josh thanks brother Dave that was good bro God bless you praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen all right let's turn to Proverbs Chapter 3. so I've got a few questions to um that I got sent through so I'm just going to go through them and if I don't make it through all of them or we'll just pick up another time um but as always you know I'm sorry I haven't given them the uh you know every question is a very good question and probably deserves a lot more of an answer and things but um yeah we can always pick these things up um so Proverbs three and five and and we'll read verse seven as well just uh amen so it says here in Proverbs 3 verses five to seven it says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and apart from evil hey malicious about our heads in a word of prayer thank you Lord Jesus truly uh What a Mighty God you are Lord you creator of heavens and earth Lord you're so awesome and we thank you we can gather this afternoon just pray your blessings upon the word oh God these questions as well we thank you in Jesus Christ's name take the service into your control For Your Glory we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you so you can have your seats so I've got a few this is not an e particular order so um I want to start with this the first one is the best advice for young people in this day and age well I think the best thing is uh make sure you know the Lord above everything if you know him you'll be successful in life you know just so make sure you know him and everything and as I read there in Proverbs 3 you trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not to thy own understanding and acknowledge Him in all and in all thy ways acknowledge Him so in everything you're going to do in life acknowledge Him and he'll direct your paths right and you know I think it's such a fundamental thing and also don't don't wander through life aimlessly have a goal have a desire to better yourself you know have you know I think life goals are good to have you know so I mean be flexible the law can guide you right if you acknowledge Him in all your ways he'll direct your paths okay and also the question really should be is who do you want to be in five years because of the decisions you make now will make you the person you are in five years time so so normally people say what do you want to be doing it's a fair enough question but who do you want to be do you want to be more sincere do you want to be more honest you want to have more Integrity do you want to you know be more loving and kind and understanding and patient do you want to be that kind of a person you know so you should really look um yeah but but you should you know we shouldn't just aimlessly go through life we should have a goal say well one day when I grow up I want to be a you know I want to have this kind of marriage I want to have this kind of home I want to have this kind of you know we should have that kind of you know goals in life because there's such a big net in this day if we go to uh habakkuk chapter one I'm gonna read verses 14 to 17. it's such a big web brother Ram talked about the web of fashion different things people get caught into these things but there's also another net and we know this is no stretch of the imagination when you know the reason why it's called the internet you know it's a net but it's designed to catch people catch your imagination and your and your thoughts and everything you are so have a cook uh 1 and 14 now just like anything with technology there's nothing wrong with the piece of technology it's how you use it so for example like YouTube there's nothing wrong with YouTube it's what you watch on YouTube right so so happy cook 1 and 14th is and maketh men as the Fishers of the sea as the creeping things that have no ruler over them they take up all of them with the angle they catch them in their net and gather them in their drag therefore they rejoice and are glad therefore they sacrifice under their net and burn incense under their drag because by them their portion is fat and their meat plenteous shall they therefore empty their net and not spare continually to slay the Nations now there's more than one way to kill a people you can physically kill people but then you can entrap their minds and that's what the you know the reason things are popular is because they're addictive you know marketing a different thing they um you know I think is a term called like brain hacking where like entertainment they actually have ways of how how to hack someone's brain so they get addicted to things so don't be caught up in the wrong kind of things you know you've got to be you know we really need Holy Ghost leadership when it comes to every part of our life but don't be caught up in the in cyberspace you know we went to live down here right sure use computers use technology but don't don't let it rule you remember these tools are for you not for you to be a tool for it yes so I think it's very important so I because especially when you know there's so much you're in this day and age there's a people have a internet kind of identity and it's been proven that people will argue and fasten things on on social media way differently than they'd sit down and talk to the person so they have one Persona on the web and the other persona in real life we should have one Persona not two right so we shouldn't so we should be the same person here as we are on the internet as we are at school or at work whatever we should be the same person so let's not be caught up in I'm just so I'm just going over this very briefly but these are things to avoid use them for your benefit but don't be dragged caught up into it you know like social media and the internet different things because people just give their whole life to living in cyberspace but they have no real reality of you know so don't be slaying in that net you know God's God's made a knife of his word to chop Us free so um yeah but I think the main thing is if you know him know him above everything and you'll be successful brother bear says give me a housewife give me a farmer give me a preacher a factory worker that'll put God first in everything and that person will be successful in spite of what the devil can do to them so put them first in everything oh I said Lord would this be pleasing for you this is my decision that I want to go I'd know study this or I'd know whatever it may be but put him first and he'll direct your paths now uh the next question now all of these questions I could spend a lot longer on so forgive me if some are shorter and longer answers different things but big question is how do you know you have the Holy Ghost I think brother Dave praise the Lord I'm so glad you shared that testimony there that's powerful that's so awesome so now I'm going to go through a few things first first brother Bram says and I believe that you must have an experience that changes your life changes your heart okay so I'm just going to read a few quotes but um so but this is not my whole answer okay so I'm going to give the whole thing because we get into a stage where we think well is my experience big enough you know because someone else had this amazing experience in a van but I've just you know given my life and here I am you know is is and but we shouldn't we should never get caught up in that kind of thinking we should think has my life changed you know so everyone's experience would be different but has our life changed right and we'll go into what that change is so because like Brother Band see is an invisible union he says now he says he says the modern Church don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it so she don't want to be impregnated with the word because it's the only kind the word can bring forth talking about babies born of the spirit of God it has to be the spirit of God in it no intellectual Church joining Creed going bobbed head painted face no such a thing as that and all that you don't find that in the word of God you find an old-fashioned Sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting and praising God so we look in the book of Acts when people receive the Holy Ghost did something happen to them right they didn't just accept it by faith and that was it they did accept it by faith but then God confirmed their faith by giving them the Holy Ghost so there's a definite see he says he says many places he says you know a birth is a mess a natural birth doesn't matter if it's in a it's in a palace or a pig pen or a hospital room any birth is a mess he says in the New Birth is the same thing it's a mess but it comes life out of that mess so so life is produced out of whatever that experience is only the way you can receive life is through a birth it's messy but it makes life people try to dodge it see some births are very simple and straightforward others are very complicated naturally speaking and it can be the same thing with a with a spiritual birth they can be either a big thing happen or a small thing but it's the life that's lived afterwards is the is the main thing see see all of our experiences can be different and everyone has different experiences because God is not a cookie cutter right he doesn't give us all the same testimony God deals and changes our lives and different ways so we should never get caught up in a trap to say I wonder if my experience is big enough but the main question we should be asking is what life did I once live and what do I live now after whatever happened to me because the Apostle Paul would say in Galatians 2 and 20 says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me so he sang the life I now live so he's saying I used to live a different kind of life but I'm different now amen now brother Brown spends um for some reason it's it's it's recorded but he has this interview with his sister Bruce and it's uh he has a private interview but it's recorded I don't know how that worked but it worked so if you go look through the message sister Bruce has been part of like she comes like she's actually in quite a few sermons that brother bear mentions and she comes to the altar fairly I know in the 50s and then you know she gets healed and God prays for I mean brother Brown prays for her she gets healed and God's working in her life but she comes to um it's an it's a 1964 she's wondering this is I think at least 10 years she's been a Christian and she and she has this interview with brother Branham because she's looking that the prophet will reveal something in her life to to to say that's when you receive the holy ghost or does she even have it she needs to know so she so she's a sincere Christian she's been walking with the Lord however many years but she but she needs to know that she has the Holy Ghost I think this is one of the biggest questions that many people have is do I really know him because if we do know we know him we can stand on that say Lord you met me and you didn't you didn't meet me to leave me but you met me to kept me keep keep me right so you know so he says now um um so he says no I visit you in the hospital that time so he's talking about in um in the past I prayed constantly God wouldn't let you die because you're a value to the church now I know you I know you're going to be all right sister Bruce I believe that with all my heart see so so she's an asset to the church she's valued to the church so she was part of the body right and sister Bruce is brother Baron most of all I want the experience that I have been sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to your hearts this is a question you can hear it on tape she wants to know I want that experience now she's thinking she doesn't have that experience and the enemy can twist our thinking round to to to get us to even think are we even saved are we even Christians you know we even you know we're being walking with the Lord how like however many years but do I even know him is it just me he does that too because he does that to me constantly and um now he says I believe with all my heart that you're a real Born Again believer sister Bruce how could that Spirit just leave when you get sick you get weary and you're a nervous type of person sister Bruce says yes and you get things on your mind little buddy things they just keep building up both ways you'll get somebody on your heart and you want to pray for them and get up and pray for it you can't rest until until that person's prayed for that's you so that's how God worked in her life she was built that way she had a burden for prayer and God answered her prayers and he says Satan works the other side he might present you something out this way see God see you've got a nature God works and Satan works then when Satan tries to make you believe that you're not see you keep building this and maybe this and this see don't look at yourself sister Bruce so she got so the devil would work in her life using her own nature that God gave her against her and and getting her to you know think on things and build up thoughts about it is she even a Christian and different things but but brother Brown tells it don't look at yourself you look at the wrong person you should look at the lamb he says I'm now fixing to pray for you I'm not worthy to do that I think what would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting here what would he do if he was sitting here he'd lay his hands upon you with his great faith he'd see see you'd get well well I think well I'm just a sinner I'm not because but I come to represent him but remember me being a sinner and before God I'm not a sinner neither are you we've got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ that's it see he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not Sinners no more we are Christian I believe you to be a genuine Christian woman but then but then she says but I make so many mistakes and he says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes won't be lauded to you see he took your mistakes your desire and your heart is to serve him she says yes all right that's what he died for so you could serve him see your mistakes are not looked not lighted to you see here's your propitiation see he's your sin offering your sins are not known you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve him but then she says but I never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on that's her words and and so brother and says all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being sister Bruce is yes see that was your nature that changed once but what changed it and and she says Christ and he says there you are sister see that's it he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life and shall not come to the Judgment but uh but hath past tense past from Death to life at Saint John 5 24 Jesus speaking see he says see you're a Christian sister Bruce I've watched your life I've watched you on Division I know you're a Christian so so she was saying I need to know the experience I've got the Holy Ghost and brother man put it down to one day she was she she's walking this way away from God doing her own thing and then something turned around to walk with God and she wants to serve him with all her heart and and that's why he asked the question well what changed it she said Christ he says that was the experience you had that was when you received the Holy Ghost see it's such a simple thing but yet it's such a powerful thing so you're going to really look at what your desires are uh after CCS after the whatever experience it is or where you are now to what you used to be you know if you used to be just come to church don't really care mum and dad do it or whatever but now you want to serve them with all your heart what's happened Christ has stepped in and then another big thing is is there's there's a difference that changes in a person's life where where we begin there's a spirit comes within us where we am in every word so it's more than just agreeing or saying Lord I want to believe that but you actually identify in it he's talking about me that's when the spirit of God comes in and I've got a scripture to back this up see it actually changes you to it's more than just I want to be but something in you changes that you say he's talking about me right because it's actually because the spirit within you will like amen every word it's not us in our Humanity amending it trying to line up with it but God puts a spirit within us and he becomes a Christian in our lives and it's like brother Brown would give a story he'd say about a like a little boy who who lived out in the country they didn't have a mirror before he'd never seen his own reflection and then he goes and uh visits his family or someone and they have a big door door sized mirror he walks in the hallway he sees he sees a little boy in the door and and then he moves and the boy moves and moves the same way and he comes to realize that's me that's me in the mirror so there was no identification took place where he could he could actually realize the one in the mirror is is him and it's the same thing when it comes to the Bible he says so I so I just wondered today if we couldn't look in the Bible say that's me as we wonder which one it is which character in The Bible we would look at and let's just take that for a little text down and stay on it with a um for a little while as we look into God's word let's identify ourselves for he give others in here for examples of what we are now remember that God takes his Spirit or sorry takes his man but never a spirit Satan takes his man but never a spirit so let's see if we can identify our present State now with Bible characters and they the Bible said all those things happen back in those days for examples for us they're our examples so there should be something when the when the Holy Ghost comes in we can actually identify in here and it's not I want to become this you say it's right it's it's written about me how do they know who I am you know because why the same spirit that wrote the word comes into you and lives the word amen he says here and God's provided place of worship he says now you've got to be born regenerated baptized with the Holy Ghost into Jesus Christ quickened to every word your spirit in you will punctuate Amen to every word of the Bible outside of that it just shakes its head on one you've got to get rid of that spirit it's not the spirit of God that will dispute the word of God it'll keep the word of God not only does it believe it but it makes it live it manifest the word of God he says yes sir so if the spirit of God is in you you won't say the words wrong you'll say Amen your life will say Amen to it because you can identify with it because it's part of you and then in Romans 8 15 and 16 he says for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption where you cry Abba Father the spirit that's big capital S that's the Holy Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God says a bearing witness within us when the word comes forth you can identify with it because you're part of it amen now I can't tell any of you if you have the Holy Ghost that's between you and God right but I'm just saying all these things because you should be able to look something happened in your life where you can identify now with the word of God it's talking about me and and the bit that it's talking about me is not the devil part or the Lake of Fire but it's the Rapture Parts Made In His Image all the Believers down Through the Ages right there's something in you that identifies with those Believers or identifies with the scripture because the spirit a new birth what his Spirit Beth witness with yours that you're a child of God right amen so the experience can be so simple but it's so powerful because what happens is your life now changes one day you're going this way and then something happened and you all you want to do is serve him what was that that was the Lord amen now now I've got a big section on a preparation of advice on courting dating and marriage now preparation what do you have in mind there's a question no no I'm putting the question back what do you have in mind what's your goal you know when it comes to courtship of marriage and dating and so on what's your goal you just want to date someone just because it's something to do everyone else is doing it or do you actually have a goal that you want to get married to a Godly person right you want to have a Godly family have Godly children you know some people well especially this day and age now when I talk about dating I'm just talking about getting to know each other I'm not talking about dating like in the world here okay so maybe I'll just give out a glossary term right there I'm not talking about worldly dating just to just to get noted like friends okay so what's your goal because ultimately we should have on on our mind that the one we're getting to know could be the one the Lord has for you and for life that's what you should be looking for ultimately long-term thinking right because this world is full of less you see where this goes and we can't be like that because the Sons and Daughters of God led by the spirit of God right God is not reactive he leads us deliberately and so we need to be really think about now where do we want this to go and that should be ultimately in our mind is this one could be the one that he wants us to as our soul mate right you know he or she is part of us and in every phase we want to treat treat others with utmost respect because they are either our spouse or someone else's and ultimately they're a son or daughter of God so you want to be very careful we're going to be careful how we treat one another we should have utmost respect because really when you think about it you we're dealing with God's children like right now I'm dealing with God's children that's that's a big thing that's not a casual thing you know so we've got to really keep that in mind that we we don't enter into anything selfishly but with prayer you know seeking God's will um it says and it says in first Timothy five one and two rebuke not the older but and treat him as a father and the younger men as Brethren the Elder women as mothers this younger as sisters with all purity so it's very important when we go into any of these things we we we we treat each other with respect right we shouldn't be afraid to talk to one another all the young people said amen don't we shouldn't get all you know no we should we should be friends right right we shouldn't be oh I can't talk to him or her whatever no no just just relax but you know see see that the dating phase what what I'm calling the dating phase is just to get to know each other before you enter into a courtship now first there should be an attraction I'm glad we have a yep somewhere there should be an attraction but then the next thing is the question should be do they know the Lord are they real Christians that should be the next thing because you can't go into anything hope hoping that they will meet the Lord you know it's like the um there's a Sight and Sound play Samson you know Samson there's one scene he wants to uh go get Mario Philistine girl and you know Samson of course his dad is not happy about it doesn't want you know Samson to get caught up with his Philistine girl and you know what Samson says but you know you're always telling us not to marry them because they'll drag us away from our garden but but what if we marry them to do the opposite why can't God do the opposite and and Samson's dad says but that's not the reason you're doing it it's not the reason you're doing it see so you can't just you can't just enter into something hoping that you know they'll become a Christian in the long run because if they don't know the Lord don't take it any further than that don't get emotionally entangled you should never do that amen and don't fixate on the what could be because the what could bees don't always end up to the reality right and and the second question really should be what kind of character do they have what kind of character do they have see who you who you marry actually reflects you brother Brown would tell us that they that that the woman is actually the heart of the man so the kind of woman that a man goes after is actually his heart now if that man is not fully surrendered to the Lord or not actually want a commitment then they'll go after that kind of a woman right but then it can be the other way around that the woman's not fully surrendered to the Lord then she can go after a man like that so we're going to look at now what kind of person am I attracted to I've actually sold out Christian that wants to serve God they can have their ups and downs their faults their fathers but do they want to serve God above all things do they know him have they had a real experience so you're going to look at that because really the person you go after reflects what's on the inside of you just like a you know a woman who's looking at you know interested in a in a guy that what what they're looking at this is the kind of leader the headship that I want for my future so it's very important that you you know we approach these things prayerfully and we really look at you know also look at how they treat other young people how they treat their families right because they can put one front up to you but then it can be a different thing you know in family circles or even you know with young people and so on so you've got to be prayerfully approach these things right it's it's very important now now I could expand that further but sorry that's just all I have on that one um but but I'm going to this later okay it's not just this is this is not the only questions and answers we'll ever have in the history of this church right so we can we can you know send it again hey more part two so I can do that now the question is now now a big question is how do I know which one is the right one because you could have right you could have someone who really knows the Lord you know they've got very good character they treat their family well you're attracted to one another but how do you know it's the right one well from my experience there's my experience okay I'm a dummy I take a while but you know when I first saw Christine I knew she was different I knew she was different she wasn't like any of the other girls in church I knew she was different and I liked it but you're special something that just caught my attention and but I was I was so maybe there was the culture of the church I was in I don't know but it was basically like don't talk to the opposite sex they're all kind of weird about that kind of stuff we shouldn't be weird about that kind of stuff it's normal right and um and so I knew she was different I liked her you know we you know I knew she loved the Lord so all those things were fitting into place and I wasn't even really looking to get married I was just happy serving God you know but thing is when you know and then and then and then so it started our friendship started to grow but she hasn't Tauranga I was down in Christchurch and she would visit every so often but um you know they came to a point where I was like Lord I need to know I need to know she's the one and we were just friends that's as far as it went because I didn't want to waste her time I thought she's an incredible young woman she's awesome she's one eight billion now you know she's Priceless so I don't want to one hurt her or you know get emotionally entangled and it's not right or you know I didn't want to do that to her because she's worth far more than that and that's I think how we should approach these things we should be careful right and then now this is over I think over a year she could tell you the story far better than I could but it was over a year from our first meeting given to win win when this was coming up and the Lord had already told her multiple times Ben's your husband you know in the world heard multiple times spoke to Audible Voice all kinds you know God I mean God just talks to her a lot and um but me it takes me a while to catch up you know but the slowest City win the race I hope um you know but so I was I was praying because I said Lord I want to know and how how God you still works with me as he is as he speaks to me out of here and I think you've got to really know it's such an important thing at every age you know God's leadership in your life see just like Dave said about the um you know the van and everything that you know I believe that was the Lord speaking to you the thing is the more he speaks the more you can trust his voice because remember the Bible says my sheep know my voice and so there must be a way he speaks to you but it's proven that that you can actually because because God interprets this word by bringing it to pass right so if he speaks to a certain thing and it comes to pass then you know it's him and um and of course it won't be out of his word it'll be in his according to his word but how he speaks to you you should have confidence how he leads you so that's why it's so important that you know the leadership of the shepherd the Lord Jesus Christ you must know that's so important and so you know the Lord would show her you know in the scripture multiple places multiple times and you know I was going to see her on the 18th of uh October I believe it was and um she was reading Proverbs on the 17th of October I mean yes on yeah on the 17th of October she's reading Proverbs chapter 18 and she had no idea that um that that at this stage I would read a proverb every day it was like my devotional in the morning like first of the month I'd read Proverbs one and as we go on and so I was doing this for about a year by this stage and she was reading proverbs 18. and there's a scripture here it says and whosoever findeth a wife findeth a good thing to obtained favor of the Lord and see the Lord said do it once again see Ben's your husband and she said Lord that's great you tell me but tell him I think it's a good way God should work both ends right you should never ever see see me maybe I'm just a bit slow and stuff but I just have confidence God if he shows you something I believe he'll make it happen sure you don't sit in the corner and you know but but God so we don't have to force things to happen right if God is leading you he will cause it to happen and so she said yep well that's great Lord but tell him so the next morning which is the proverb which is the 18th of of um October I was reading Proverbs 18. and I got down to that verse and as soon as I got and I read that for over a year but as soon as I read that verse the Lord said Christine is your wife so he confirmed it in the scripture right so I mean that's my experience that's how I know she's the right one one we're attracted to each other we love each other but he confirmed it in the scripture right so we can and and there's many other places as well but we can we can take always take it back to there so you can have confidence now boom so yeah so it's awesome but you know you just got to rest in the Lord's leadership you know just just trust them and uh he'll he'll he'll see you through you know I'm sure we can we could all have testimonies where God led us through right showed us which way to go so so just know his leadership and like even brother bam says you know like your parents they can instruct you in these things so if you've got a question about a boy or a girl go to your mum and dad go to them remember because they know you better than you know yourself you know they raise you as a baby they bottle feed you they did everything for you then then here you are at this age so talk to them right because sure they'll they'll have their mama bear you know defenses and papa bear depending on boy or girl but they have they can see things you cannot see rights are always always have your parents involved because Dad is gatekeeper to the daughter right so it's absolutely essential that when it comes to boys gonna go wanting to know girls they have to talk to the dad because it's got to be a respective headship because ultimately there's going to be a transfer of headship where where she will come under your head chips there's a very important thing you respect to a current headship it's absolutely essential because it's far head chippers are far more spiritual important thing than we realize it's not just a here's the family tree and this one's marriage of this no it's farmer it's a spiritual thing so it's very important that you keep your um talk to your appearance about them okay they will they will help you out far more than I think anyone ever could in those you know in those matters anyway we can go part two um later on that so now when do we start this 2 30. okay this won't take much longer now how to have unconditional love so unconditional love has no conditions so if you want to have an unconditional love don't look for love in return see don't look so so brother bam says it's like Grace you know Grace is not I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine gracious says you need a back scratch I'll scratch your back it's the same thing with unconditional love you're not looking for anything good in response but you want to give love anyway and the reason why we give love anyway is because we have an end goal in mind so maybe there's a family of its Wayward you want them to meet the Lord or a friend or whoever it may be then you love them unconditionally because you have faith Lord that you're going to get hold of them through this so I think it's a very but you've got to have that end goal in mind and you've got to um just love them no matter what comes back because it's unconditional right but remember you've got to have faith Lord You're Gonna touch them through this in some way amen uh advice for mine battles now first you've got to identify it's a mind battle because sometimes the devil can be talking to you and you can just be thinking it's you I get into that trap quite a lot that I realize hold on hold on so first you identify it's a mind battle and then secondly don't entertain them think the opposite you know if you've got a mind battle like an inferiority complex no one likes you no one cares think the opposite you know do the opposite that's so important you know also your mind think of you know like the Apostle Paul gives such good instruction here and in in in Ephesians 5 19 20. speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so if you've got mind bowels and you're feeling down and you know because you know mind bowels will will always try and isolate you make you feel down and make you feel bad against other people that's how they and make you feel worthless right because you know you you look at the conclusion of the whole thought process that's really what it wants to do the deer wants to isolate you make you think you're worthless no one cares you have no value you know that's what he wants to do but if you if you speak to yourself in your heart to the Lord as you know with Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and making melody in your heart what happens is your thinking will change right so so if you're going through a mind battle what's your favorite song push play in here and sing it with all your heart only well if you can sing outwardly but if you can't sing you're singing yeah right but I mean you can sing outwardly anyway but you know what I mean like change the atmosphere don't just keep and and the Bible says that we can cast down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and I think the best way to do that if you can see your you're having a mind battle some kind of negative thought going on it's so good you start singing and giving thanks to the Lord on your heart it will change your thinking you know I think it's such a powerful thing that you know you know the Lord would have uh Inspire the Apostle Paul to write there in you know in Ephesians 5. it's absolutely important now next question we can go on these things another way yo if you want part two say there's more to that surely okay how to spread the gospel to the people in the world that's such a fundamental this is why we're here going to All Nations and preach the gospel the first thing is pray first be be prayerful be prayerful because we want to find that last one that we can go home hey don't ultimately want to go home you know I hope I didn't make it sound wrong on Wednesday you know we should want to go on a Rapture right but we shouldn't want to go because we're unhappy with our current life we should want to go because we want to see him okay but that you know but there's a whole reason you want to see Souls come in because we would find that last one that we can go home and even even even the Lord would say in Matthew and you know also in a different gospel um you know pray ye the lord of the Harvest that he'll send laborers into his Harvest so to say Lord send laborers into your Harvest even though he's the lord of the Harvest himself you know so so I think it's so important that we have on our heart that we try and witness the people now if you if you're looking for what to say I believe the Lord will guide you but people are looking for reality they don't want a theory they don't want a religion they want a reality so I think one of the best things to do is tell them how your candle got lit tell them what happened to you tell them what Jesus has done for you right because show them the reality of the message people are looking for reality they don't want religion you know and if you talk to someone and you got on your heart you want to witness to them mention God or church or a testimony in as you're talking and see how they respond if they just ignore it well then maybe you know but then if they start changing the subject towards the Lord or saying then you can open it further right but so so take an opening if it's there but stop when you feel resistance you've got to be sensitive to the Lord you know too and also remember that your life speaks louder than you realize so you're actually a living testimony without even saying anything you're because people read us read Our Lives see our character see how we respond to things they're watching they're reading us and saying is what he believes or she believes producing that you know because they may never come to this church read the Bible or listen to the message but they'll read your life and so I think it's so important to spread the gospel start with just being a living witness to the people you know at school or job or wherever it may be and and let the Lord lead you maybe you'll lead you to hand out tracks or give out books or sing on the street corner but whatever it is just start by being a witness to those around you amen it starts you know it all starts like that right and God can God can guide it but you know it's it's so important just just trust in the Lord and have a burden for lost souls right and and just go be a witness and see however it'll you know the Lord is the one who brings them in but I think it's a good it's a good burden to have now we can go on more about that too now how to trust in the Lord even in the silent moments of Life how to trust in him well that's when Faith takes you through it's when God is silent that's when Faith really takes you through see remember he didn't save you to lose you always remember that now it says in James here my brother encountered all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience say that when your faith is tried when the when when God seems silent but but you see the enemy's doing something is trouble well your faith will work the trying of your faith worketh patience now that worketh means to work out to do that from which something results so so you get you so the trying of your faith will work your patience we'll we'll we'll produce a result now that patience is patience with God amen so when he's silent you can be able to rest and trust in him that in his time he will answer he will come on the scene but just because he doesn't speak straight away doesn't mean you just quit keep serving the lord right we'll have silent moments in our life where we we can't seem to find a an answer from you know you know just said Lord where are you but he said I'll never leave the nor forsake me and we can have confidence that he will he will guide us through but see Faith see if if we knew from this moment every detail of our life to the rapture we wouldn't need faith because God's already shown us right but it's a we walk by faith and not by sight so Eve so in those silent moments God hasn't left you you just have confidence that he'll see you through those moments just keep walking through amen you've got to be certain of God amen maybe I'll just read this here he says um yeah but let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect an entire wanting nothing if any of you lack Wisdom ask him of God that giveth to all men liberally and upgradeth not and it shall be given them but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waveereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and toss so don't be wavering will you get the answer or not is he with you or not you know he's with you hey man so you can just rest in him praise the Lord let's just um and how do you display eternal life and live for others well that's you know by showing unconditional love you display eternal life just by your actions by your life that you live because remember we don't get eternal life by walking in these doors and then we when we walk out there we're like the world we're Christians everywhere right right so so your life when you go to work you go to school wherever you go it's actually eternal life on display but it's just like the Lord Jesus you know he was he looked like anyone else he you know he dressed in the common common robes everything he looked like anyone else
