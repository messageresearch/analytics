[30:59] reminded one day
[31:01] you know you don't want to be reminded
[31:04] when
[31:04] when the time is gone that that you
[31:07] should have told your brother that you
[31:09] love him
[31:10] or you love her you don't want to be
[31:13] reminded one day
[31:14] to realize that ah i should have thought
[31:18] better
[31:18] about her about him oh
[31:21] i should have prayed for her you know
[31:25] it might be a little bit too late across
[31:28] the line
[31:29] you know i don't want to be refreshed
[31:32] later on that ha
[31:33] [Music]
[31:35] i miss her or i miss him
[31:39] you know why i'm saying this is that i
[31:42] lost a friend of mine
[31:44] this week a very close friend of mine
[31:48] and he was a deacon for many years and
[31:53] he spoke to me some time ago he said but
[31:56] import
[31:56] and say how are you doing there in new
[31:58] zealand
[32:00] and they gave me a call later on and we
[32:01] chatted he was like
[32:03] a young father you know that kind of a
[32:05] person that
[32:06] you're not the same age but your friends
[32:09] and
[32:10] and his family was just being very nice
[32:13] to us as
[32:13] young students at university you know we
[32:16] knew
[32:16] if we need food we go to his house we
[32:19] knew that
[32:20] you know he loved us very much yet he
[32:22] had our best interests at heart
[32:24] but now i realize that i miss him
[32:28] i realize that now i feel i want to give
[32:31] him something
[32:33] you know i feel i feel
[32:36] i miss him just ask him for me him
[32:40] do you have 100 there do you have 100
[32:41] there for me you know i just miss that
[32:44] and and in life sometimes you sit there
[32:47] and maybe
[32:47] maybe you even get annoyed by sister
[32:50] media asking you
[32:51] do you have 250 dollars for me you get
[32:54] annoyed
[32:55] sorry media oh sister maggie
[32:59] ask you something you get annoyed by
[33:00] your brother or your sister you get
[33:02] irritated why
[33:03] because we are wearing this flesh that
[33:06] is so
[33:06] limited one day your brother or your
[33:10] sister is gone
[33:11] you miss that thing that you were
[33:13] annoyed
[33:14] for her or for him to do it to you for
[33:16] you you miss it why
[33:18] because actually you laugh you always
[33:20] love that brother that sister
[33:22] just the devil wanted to to make it as
[33:25] if
[33:27] there's a is a thing between you so
[33:29] that's what came to me
[33:31] you know this week when i thought of
[33:32] about about my brother william
[33:35] i always miss him but not much about him
[33:38] he's gone on waiting for us to come
[33:40] thank you so much brother isaac
[33:42] for the choice of songs this morning
[33:45] and they just blended so well with
[33:47] sister deborah and sister sheridan
[33:48] those songs that they sung so
[33:52] my song just remind me
[33:56] about going you know i've been thinking
[33:59] lately that lord
[34:00] if there's so many believers that are
[34:02] going actually lord why don't you just
[34:05] take us all
[34:07] and we just go so
[34:10] it was a bit selfish because maybe some
[34:12] of us are not ready yet
[34:14] maybe me myself i'm not ready but
[34:17] because it's just become so overwhelming
[34:21] but you know god is preparing his
[34:23] children
[34:25] because there's a scripture in the bible
[34:26] that says
[34:28] we cannot all go we cannot all go
[34:32] which means there are going to be some
[34:33] who are going to go
[34:36] that is what it means my sister that
[34:37] which means there are some who are going
[34:40] to
[34:40] go but we cannot all go
[34:44] but we cannot go ahead of those ones
[34:47] that have gone
[34:48] on before us for they shall resurrect
[34:50] and we shall see them
[34:52] and when we see them we know that we are
[34:55] going
[34:56] so going before the rapture is a given
[35:00] we are going to go some of us some of us
[35:02] we are not going to go
[35:03] and when i think of that and what god is
[35:06] doing
[35:07] i feel like singing this song that says
[35:09] i feel like traveling on
[35:12] and i don't know if the band can play it
[35:13] for me in the way that i would love to
[35:16] uh i want to play it my way or to sing
[35:19] it
[35:20] the way that it will please the lord and

[50:58] god bless you friends you may
[51:00] have your seats this morning you just
[51:01] want to turn me down a little bit
[51:03] um i want to talk i just want to take
[51:05] that little uh
[51:07] peace there and brother brown tells us
[51:08] that it's not the uh
[51:10] amount of text you know that you read
[51:12] necessarily but it's what's in it that
[51:13] really matters we know
[51:14] the word of god is eternal even even the
[51:17] scripture jesus wept is an incredible
[51:19] powerful scripture
[51:20] but the about it says that i was in the
[51:22] spirit on the lord's day now
[51:24] the prophet tells us that if before we
[51:26] do anything we need to get
[51:28] into the spirit amen and and and the
[51:31] reason that that that
[51:32] john was in the spirit is because god
[51:34] was gonna show him certain things now
[51:37] when you see something it's incredibly
[51:39] powerful there's a reality that comes to
[51:41] it
[51:42] right you know there's a yeah you know
[51:43] there's that you know it's more than
[51:44] just something imagine but you actually
[51:46] see it you comprehend it so here's
[51:48] john and god comes he says i was in the
[51:50] spirit now the most important thing to
[51:52] do
[51:53] is get in the spirit first and then god
[51:55] can work you know that's why we have
[51:57] song servers that's why we enter in when
[51:58] we sing we get to praise and worship god
[52:00] it's because we want to enter into his
[52:02] spirit because we need to get into his
[52:04] spirit first
[52:05] and then the supernatural can happen i
[52:08] mean we serve a supernatural god today
[52:10] i mean he can do anything i mean he's
[52:12] not limited by anything amen he's the
[52:15] almighty unlimited jesus christ i mean
[52:18] so the first thing we need to do
[52:19] is get into the spirit now this may be
[52:22] very elementary but
[52:23] brother bam says in questions and
[52:24] answers 1954 he says now
[52:26] we've got to get in the spirit of the
[52:28] last days
[52:29] when the last days are here it says you
[52:32] go to a dance hall
[52:33] you've got to get in the spirit of
[52:35] dancing or they won't dance
[52:37] you go to the church you've got to get
[52:39] in the spirit of worship before you can
[52:41] worship
[52:41] the world's got to get in the spirit of
[52:43] the last days before the last days can
[52:45] come
[52:46] and we're in the spirit of the last days
[52:48] and god promised that these things would
[52:50] be here that's what we've got we're in
[52:52] the last days
[52:53] he says that men and women are getting
[52:55] asleep and don't realize it so
[52:57] you know we don't want to fall asleep
[52:59] you know i think it was the last part of
[53:00] pilgrim's progress
[53:01] as they were on the way to the celestial
[53:03] city was right there and they kept you
[53:04] had to wake each other up they were
[53:06] falling asleep on the path and
[53:07] you know we don't want to fall asleep in
[53:09] these last days but we want to get in
[53:11] the spirit of the lord
[53:12] amen that he will show us not only
[53:14] things that are to come
[53:16] but to show us our current state i mean
[53:18] because when you can see what he has
[53:20] done for you
[53:20] amen that puts a real shout in you that
[53:23] puts a real joy that puts a real
[53:25] happiness your heaviness just leaves
[53:26] your joy comes
[53:28] amen when we can see really what the
[53:30] lord has done you know i believe in a
[53:31] pentecostal worship
[53:33] i believe in a i believe this message is
[53:34] pentecostal not in the denominational
[53:37] sense
[53:37] but in the reality as god has restored
[53:39] us back to the faith of the fathers and
[53:42] the faith of the fathers in the book of
[53:43] acts not their failures not their
[53:45] humanity but god abiding and dwelling in
[53:47] a people
[53:48] was a pentecostal worship a pentecostal
[53:51] walk where god
[53:52] dwelled in the people and showed them
[53:54] and manifested the liberty that he won
[53:56] for them that day on calvary
[53:57] but you've got to get into the spirit
[53:58] that's why you can't just sit there like
[54:00] a dead stump you've got to enter in
[54:01] i mean if you know if you if you ever go
[54:04] to a place and not enter into the spirit
[54:05] you'll never get really what wants to be
[54:07] given to you
[54:08] i mean so we here in church you know the
[54:10] holy ghost is here he wants to minister
[54:12] something to us
[54:13] he wants to do something in our lives
[54:15] but we've got to enter into it
[54:16] you've got to be a part yeah you just
[54:18] can't be sitting on the benches watching
[54:20] you got to be part of it
[54:21] you know you're all the highs and the
[54:22] lows and you know you know there's the
[54:24] olympics are going on at the moment
[54:26] the people who are really entering in
[54:28] are getting into the spirit of the
[54:30] olympics
[54:31] you know those maybe they can't be in
[54:32] the stands because they're covered with
[54:34] those on tv they get up all crazy hours
[54:36] of the morning
[54:37] you know night time they're cheering for
[54:38] their country they're excited
[54:40] you know because they get into the
[54:41] spirit of it but how could you ever just
[54:44] sit there
[54:44] you know and say well that was nice and
[54:46] you maybe it's been the
[54:48] record smash of the century an
[54:49] incredible game or whatever and
[54:51] but you know if you're not in the spirit
[54:52] of it you're not going to enjoy what's
[54:54] going on
[54:55] because you're not in the spirit and
[54:56] those who get in the spirit look at
[54:58] those who are not in the spirit they
[54:59] think what's wrong with that person
[55:01] because those who are in the spirit are
[55:02] enjoying what the spirit is producing
[55:04] that's the same thing with our god you
[55:06] know those who are in the spirit
[55:08] hallelujah rejoice what god is doing
[55:11] amen but though and they look at those
[55:12] who are not in the spirit they say
[55:13] what's wrong with that person
[55:15] not looking at anyone right now but you
[55:16] know our god is a supernatural god
[55:19] you know david we would read here and um
[55:21] and and second kings let's go here to
[55:23] second kings i just want to
[55:25] um you know there's more for us
[55:28] you know the devil's been fighting me
[55:30] all week
[55:31] so you know what i've been reading this
[55:34] book it's really blessed me actually
[55:35] it's been um
[55:36] it's called the light of days and it's
[55:38] actually testimonies
[55:39] of women jewish resistance fighters in
[55:43] world war ii
[55:45] in the in the warsaw ghetto uprising all
[55:47] different ones and these and these and
[55:49] these women
[55:50] so so they looked they were jewish but
[55:51] they looked more uh european than jewish
[55:54] they could blend in with with with
[55:55] society they're in poland different
[55:57] things
[55:57] and they were the secret couriers who
[55:59] are courier messages take
[56:00] weapons and things and they had to bluff
[56:03] their way past the guards gestapo false
[56:05] papers all kinds of things
[56:06] but they did these things because they
[56:08] came to a conclusion
[56:10] because they they come to realize that
[56:12] they were all going to be exterminated
[56:14] so they decided i'd rather choose how
[56:16] i'm going to die
[56:17] they realize they're going to die
[56:18] they're either going to die in a
[56:19] concentration camp or they're going to
[56:21] die fighting the nazis and they decided
[56:23] i'm going to choose the day of my death
[56:25] i'm not going to let the enemy take my
[56:27] life i'm going to give my life for this
[56:29] cause it's the same thing with you and i
[56:31] all of humanity's gonna die one day
[56:34] right
[56:34] every single one you'll either die now
[56:37] as in give your life to christ and be
[56:39] born again and then you can never die
[56:41] all you die eternally one day i but so
[56:45] i've decided
[56:46] i'm going to choose the day i die and i
[56:48] died in 2007.
[56:50] hallelujah that's the day i died to
[56:52] myself and met the lord jesus christ
[56:54] and we might as well kill a few devils
[56:55] while we're here hallelujah amen
[56:58] yeah the odds may be stacked against us
[57:00] but in reality if god be for us who can
[57:01] be against us
[57:02] but they just decided i'm just gonna you
[57:04] know they decided they knew they
[57:06] couldn't win
[57:06] but i said might as well take as many as
[57:08] we can should be the same thing
[57:10] even though we know we're going to win
[57:12] but why why why be dumb driven cattle
[57:14] why do what everyone else can do
[57:17] everyone else can go the way of the
[57:18] world why do whatever everyone's like i
[57:20] want to be unique i want to be have my
[57:22] own identity and they try and
[57:23] have their own style of clothes and the
[57:24] way things they listen to and how they
[57:26] walk and talk and they just end up like
[57:28] everyone else
[57:29] oh but i'm you know i'm you know no you
[57:32] just
[57:32] they just like become like everyone else
[57:34] i've been there done that i'm glad i
[57:36] don't have the t-shirt no more
[57:38] right so but why not do what bill why
[57:41] not actually be unique and actually
[57:42] serve god
[57:44] amen but you got to get into the spirit
[57:47] now where were we second kings
[57:48] yeah okay that's where we're going
[57:50] wasn't it did i say that
[57:53] okay second kings
[57:56] three ten to fifteen
[58:01] we're going to be very careful at the
[58:03] response
[58:04] we have our god supernatural
[58:08] our god is not put in a box you know you
[58:10] know the most dead religion there
[58:11] is is western christianity
[58:17] you take the all the denomination the
[58:18] anglican church the lutheran church the
[58:22] catholic church the orthodox ways of
[58:25] pious you know i remember sitting i had
[58:27] to endure
[58:28] chapel three days a week at an anglican
[58:31] boarding school
[58:32] i had i said endure and you had a sheet
[58:35] of paper
[58:36] we'll now stand up and say this who's
[58:38] endured this kind of thing
[58:41] repeat and the priest says this you say
[58:43] this and he says this and you say this
[58:44] you sit here and they do this you stand
[58:46] here you sing this and it's just all
[58:48] this you go through this
[58:49] i don't know what it is but that's the
[58:52] devil making a mockery out of worship
[58:54] and you can actually take it into the
[58:56] modern era where it's just all lights
[58:58] and smoke machines and fan dangles
[59:00] nonsense and that's another mockery
[59:03] but in reality real heartfelt worship
[59:07] is not a dead form it's not just
[59:09] conforming to some
[59:10] idea of this is how christianity should
[59:13] be and
[59:14] based on culture or creed or whatever no
[59:16] no worship's not that way
[59:18] and david was that kind of man where he
[59:20] wasn't conformed to
[59:22] how people thought he should worship i
[59:24] mean because all he cared about was
[59:25] pleasing god
[59:27] hallelujah and he had a response can you
[59:29] imagine you know the most glorious thing
[59:31] you could have in your possession as
[59:32] king is the ark
[59:34] hallelujah and it had been in the
[59:35] philistine lands it had been there over
[59:38] edom's house and different things but
[59:39] finally it's coming into a city and it's
[59:41] coming the right way
[59:43] hallelujah and he begin to get excited
[59:45] and i think we should get excited
[59:47] i think this word should excite us i
[59:48] think this message should excite us
[59:50] i mean we hear about the fifth seal say
[59:52] hallelujah or the sixth seal or the
[59:54] seventh sea of the lord coming
[59:55] self-dwelling in you and i
[59:56] or whatever part of the word is it
[59:58] should excite us it should ignite a
[1:00:00] passion
[1:00:01] amen that our god is god i mean he's the
[1:00:03] god of gods everything else just some
[1:00:05] dead idol that's a fake
[1:00:06] amen but we have the real genuine lord
[1:00:08] jesus christ a man should excite us that
[1:00:10] we should realize
[1:00:11] we are his children we are his victory i
[1:00:14] mean we are his purchase possession
[1:00:16] hallelujah so he began to dance
[1:00:20] he didn't ask anyone else about what he
[1:00:22] should do
[1:00:23] he wasn't worried about the cod of life
[1:00:26] that's not cod fish that's conduct order
[1:00:29] and doctrine
[1:00:30] he wasn't too worried about that because
[1:00:32] he realized he was in
[1:00:33] the spirit you know i tell a joke
[1:00:35] because i want people to relax
[1:00:37] people get so you know
[1:00:41] this is not an exam you're not sitting
[1:00:43] in front of some policemen getting
[1:00:44] interrogated
[1:00:45] you know this is not some you know are
[1:00:48] you with me
[1:00:49] do you agree or i don't think there's a
[1:00:51] police station
[1:00:53] i'm not barely in blue today
[1:00:57] maybe i'm undercover anyway but you know
[1:01:00] so he sees the ark coming
[1:01:01] and and all he because he has a heart he
[1:01:04] loves god
[1:01:05] he loves god he loves jehovah amen
[1:01:08] he was anointed by him amen as a
[1:01:10] shepherd boy then finally the ark's
[1:01:12] coming and he begins to dance
[1:01:14] and he begins to dance and he begins to
[1:01:16] dance and he doesn't ask anyone he
[1:01:17] doesn't care how people see him do it
[1:01:19] he's not worried about if he's in time
[1:01:21] or out of time or whatever time
[1:01:23] but he's in tune with the spirit of the
[1:01:24] composer amen because he began to see he
[1:01:27] got in the spirit
[1:01:28] and he began to see god's coming into my
[1:01:30] city i mean jehovah god created heavens
[1:01:32] and earth is going to dwell in my city
[1:01:34] and he began to dance and dance and
[1:01:35] dance and dance but there was someone
[1:01:37] else who was watching the possession
[1:01:39] now his his worship spread
[1:01:44] everyone else was rejoicing how could
[1:01:46] you not it's infectious
[1:01:48] i mean people are worried about a virus
[1:01:50] and i forgive me for saying it this way
[1:01:52] but the holy ghost spreads it's
[1:01:53] contagious but you've got to get into
[1:01:55] the right atmosphere
[1:01:57] in yourself remember you know god could
[1:01:59] be filling someone right now next year
[1:02:01] they could be having a jubilee time and
[1:02:02] you could be sitting there saying what's
[1:02:04] wrong with those people just get in the
[1:02:05] spirit
[1:02:06] get in the spirit just enjoy what's
[1:02:07] going on and then but there was another
[1:02:09] person sitting there
[1:02:11] and she looked out her window and she
[1:02:13] was a king's daughter
[1:02:15] and she felt entitled because of her
[1:02:17] position well i'm in the message and
[1:02:19] this is who my
[1:02:20] parents are blah blah and she began to
[1:02:22] look down and saw her husband dancing
[1:02:25] and she wasn't in the same spirit she
[1:02:27] was actually in the spirit of being
[1:02:28] scornful
[1:02:30] and she actually was she was actually
[1:02:33] detested
[1:02:34] what her husband was doing and he was in
[1:02:36] the spirit of god
[1:02:39] we must be very careful our attitude
[1:02:43] towards what god does amen if i see god
[1:02:47] do something i say i want some of that
[1:02:49] i want him to live not just for that
[1:02:51] person i'm glad when god touches someone
[1:02:53] else but what about me
[1:02:54] i'm here too here's my cup lord i fill
[1:02:56] it up lord
[1:02:57] hallelujah so she began to look out and
[1:03:00] because she thought well
[1:03:01] he's embarrassing me what will the other
[1:03:04] woman at court think here's my husband
[1:03:05] dancing and you know expose whatever
[1:03:07] himself and he
[1:03:08] he's dancing around and you know he's
[1:03:11] going to embarrass me
[1:03:14] you know and then finally there's all
[1:03:16] pent up in her but she should have just
[1:03:17] got in the spirit
[1:03:19] she didn't see because she if she got in
[1:03:22] the spirit that was on her husband
[1:03:23] then she would have been dancing too
[1:03:26] hallelujah
[1:03:27] oh hey this is infectious amen our god
[1:03:30] reigns
[1:03:31] the lord god omnipotent reigneth
[1:03:33] hallelujah
[1:03:34] and then she looks out and then finally
[1:03:37] after all said and done now are we in
[1:03:39] second king when i say that i'm asking
[1:03:42] myself am i there
[1:03:43] now wait no that's not where we should
[1:03:46] be
[1:03:48] ii samuel
[1:03:51] ii samuel i actually put a thing here
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:54] you know brother bram he says sometimes
[1:03:56] you know he wants to act the most
[1:03:57] you know but he's trying to behave he
[1:03:59] actually says it that way
[1:04:00] and you know you know what he said you
[1:04:02] know he used to stand there by the
[1:04:04] pulpit like this because of the
[1:04:05] microphones
[1:04:06] right this is how he used to stand
[1:04:07] because the mark he didn't have this
[1:04:09] kind of thing going on
[1:04:10] and he actually said he wanted a web mic
[1:04:12] that's the technology they had so
[1:04:13] basically a whole bunch of mics hangs
[1:04:14] from the ceiling so you could preach up
[1:04:16] and down the whole place
[1:04:17] and beforehand apparently before i was
[1:04:19] ever recorded he'd just preach up and
[1:04:20] down
[1:04:21] the whole yo the whole time he wasn't
[1:04:22] just standing because some people think
[1:04:24] you need pulpit manners
[1:04:26] what's pulpit manners i didn't go i
[1:04:28] didn't learn this at some school of
[1:04:29] etiquette and
[1:04:30] you know i met god on my knees
[1:04:33] down on my knees i met my jesus down on
[1:04:35] my knees i found the lord
[1:04:37] amen and he became real to me i mean he
[1:04:39] changed my life
[1:04:40] it wasn't just a nice idea conforming to
[1:04:42] some mould of a religion i met him
[1:04:44] and he transformed my life hallelujah
[1:04:47] he's still the same today
[1:04:48] i mean so who cares about pulpit manners
[1:04:50] pure manners just praise god
[1:04:52] hallelujah hey the joy of the lord is
[1:04:54] our strength
[1:04:55] it keeps us strong not our reasoning not
[1:04:58] our situation as the joy of the lord is
[1:05:00] our strength
[1:05:01] i mean to realize that our sins have
[1:05:03] been washed away having to realize that
[1:05:05] there's nothing held against us
[1:05:06] it doesn't matter what fights us what
[1:05:08] comes against us you know what i love
[1:05:10] okay we'll get there but let's just go
[1:05:11] somewhere else first
[1:05:12] you know what i love about god is he
[1:05:15] causes you to know
[1:05:17] that your sins are gone he wants you to
[1:05:19] know
[1:05:20] not just that to i hear my no for you to
[1:05:23] know
[1:05:23] you take the children of israel moses
[1:05:26] would prophesy they were there by the
[1:05:28] red sea they were all panicking
[1:05:30] god just said to moses speak and go
[1:05:32] forward and so
[1:05:34] moses didn't know how it was going to be
[1:05:35] done but he would stand there the people
[1:05:37] of israel are there
[1:05:38] the reds he's not parted he says you see
[1:05:42] these egyptians
[1:05:43] today you'll see them no more forever
[1:05:47] that's what he said he didn't know how
[1:05:48] it was going to happen now
[1:05:50] god could have done it in such a way
[1:05:51] that the red sea parted and israel
[1:05:53] crossed over
[1:05:54] then the red sea closed and then maybe
[1:05:57] they think well
[1:05:58] our enemies away there somewhere they
[1:06:00] can't get to us
[1:06:01] so now we won't see them now forever
[1:06:03] because they're gone but that's not what
[1:06:05] god does
[1:06:06] he actually caused pharaoh's armies to
[1:06:08] come into a death trap
[1:06:10] hallelujah and then he he allowed israel
[1:06:14] to look and watch the sea come down and
[1:06:16] drown them and
[1:06:18] kill them all i mean that they would
[1:06:19] begin to realize amen
[1:06:21] they would see that their enemy is dead
[1:06:24] and the reason they'll see them no more
[1:06:25] forever is because they drown
[1:06:27] it's the same thing with the blood of
[1:06:29] jesus christ amen the lord allows us to
[1:06:31] pass through
[1:06:32] holy but the enemy chases us but he
[1:06:34] can't get through and the blood covers
[1:06:36] him and destroys them and then we see
[1:06:38] that it's all drowned amen we see it's
[1:06:40] all gone
[1:06:41] hallelujah and it's not just i hear my
[1:06:43] sins are gone no
[1:06:45] god drops a revelation into your heart i
[1:06:47] mean that nothing can be held against
[1:06:48] you
[1:06:49] that you're a free person you've got
[1:06:50] liberty now amen whom the son is set
[1:06:52] free is free indeed
[1:06:54] hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:06:59] hallelujah get into the spirit of it
[1:07:01] you'll begin to enjoy it hallelujah
[1:07:03] hallelujah but the only thing that could
[1:07:05] torment them now is a memory
[1:07:08] oh egypt's still over that sea oh
[1:07:11] remember those task masters but then i
[1:07:13] begin to realize
[1:07:14] he died she died
[1:07:18] that horrible task master where'd you
[1:07:20] get those whips
[1:07:21] whip marks daddy this one this one this
[1:07:24] one all that scary daddy no dora he died
[1:07:27] sorry that thing's dead there's actually
[1:07:29] trophies now
[1:07:30] that god god allowed me he actually
[1:07:33] destroyed the one that put the beatings
[1:07:34] on me
[1:07:35] i mean that devil that tormented the
[1:07:37] family for generations that died
[1:07:39] hallelujah he got drowned you don't need
[1:07:42] to be afraid of a memory anymore i mean
[1:07:44] because you got to bring that memory
[1:07:45] into present day and say well what
[1:07:47] happened to it it died
[1:07:48] i mean that sin died i mean by the blood
[1:07:51] of jesus christ
[1:07:53] hallelujah amen so don't be tormented by
[1:07:56] a memory
[1:07:58] because you know the devil only gives
[1:08:00] you a partial truth
[1:08:02] remember that sin that you couldn't get
[1:08:03] over and hear and and then people go oh
[1:08:05] it's back again no it's not back again
[1:08:07] the devil's trying to haunt you by a
[1:08:08] memory
[1:08:09] but then bring remind him of what
[1:08:11] happened
[1:08:12] that day when the lord dethroned satan
[1:08:14] out of your heart then he took his
[1:08:16] abode hallelujah amen
[1:08:21] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:25] amen so here's david he's dancing we'll
[1:08:27] come back there

[1:08:30] that was carried through the red sea
[1:08:32] that was carried over jordan carried
[1:08:34] into jail and the waters parted
[1:08:35] that was carried around jericho amen
[1:08:38] that made the walls fell down flat when
[1:08:39] they shouted they blew the trumpets
[1:08:41] i mean that same arc was coming into the
[1:08:43] city and he began to dance he began to
[1:08:45] cut up and rejoice and

[1:09:27] earnest of our
[1:09:29] inheritance it's the down payment
[1:09:31] brother graham says
[1:09:33] so it's so it's a down payment and god
[1:09:36] gives you the down payment because
[1:09:37] there's more to have

[1:10:22] can go rejoicing on my way because i
[1:10:24] have the funds i need
[1:10:26] to get what i need harley and i'm not
[1:10:28] sitting here but the thing is
[1:10:30] i have to put it into action believing i
[1:10:33] can use this to go

[1:10:36] believe the funds on here can buy the
[1:10:38] loaf of bread i won't go get it
[1:10:39] it may seem very real you may see the
[1:10:41] price and see the digits on here but

[1:10:44] faith into action it's the same thing
[1:10:45] with you and i amen
[1:10:47] you know the bank of heaven never comes
[1:10:49] back unlimited funds
[1:10:50] it never comes back empty it never we
[1:10:52] don't have checks anymore but
[1:10:54] checks don't bounce you know other so we
[1:10:56] can go put our faith into
[1:10:58] action and begin to praise god holy and
[1:11:01] say thank you jesus the answer is on its
[1:11:03] way
[1:11:04] amen hallelujah

[1:11:18] not days
[1:11:18] from hands it could be right now you got
[1:11:21] to let your faith loose just get in the
[1:11:22] spirit say amen
[1:11:25] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:28] now that reminds me of a quote
[1:11:37] if i can find it he says if you get into
[1:11:41] the spirit
[1:11:43] it's not jumping out of me right now you
[1:11:46] get into the spirit
[1:11:47] just like if you're sick and you get
[1:11:48] anointed with oil you get into the
[1:11:49] spirit first
[1:11:51] then you go through the function of the
[1:11:52] word and then brother bam says in the
[1:11:54] mind of god in the economy of god it's
[1:11:56] already done
[1:11:57] you've got to get into the spirit first
[1:11:59] i mean it's a david's dancing
[1:12:01] his wife is scorning see you can get
[1:12:04] into many different spirits
[1:12:05] it's not just the spirit of the lord and
[1:12:06] nothing there's no voids in this world
[1:12:09] there's no voices either god or satan i
[1:12:12] mean it's a great conflict we're talking
[1:12:13] about that as well the great conflict in
[1:12:14] god and satan there's not
[1:12:16] there's not neutral parties i mean
[1:12:18] there's no neutral countries
[1:12:20] in this conflict like in other conflicts
[1:12:22] it's either you're for us or against us
[1:12:24] you're either for god or against god i'd
[1:12:27] be on god's side because i know who wins
[1:12:29] he's the winner of this conflict
[1:12:31] hallelujah
[1:12:32] and so there's no so you can be in the
[1:12:34] spirit of many different things there's
[1:12:35] a spirit of unbelief
[1:12:37] amen there's a spirit of selfishness
[1:12:40] unforgiveness business it all comes from
[1:12:42] the devil
[1:12:44] there can be religious spirits that
[1:12:46] people won't take the full counsel of
[1:12:48] god
[1:12:49] but we want to be in the spirit of the
[1:12:50] lord because the spirit of the lord you
[1:12:53] get into his spirit he begins to show
[1:12:54] you things they
[1:12:56] though they may not appear now though
[1:12:58] that but they are
[1:13:00] right they're on their way
[1:13:03] just like john on the isle of patmos he
[1:13:05] saw from his time
[1:13:07] to until there was no time into eternity
[1:13:11] hallelujah amen so we must get
[1:13:15] in the spirit now
[1:13:18] he says here this is in separation from
[1:13:21] unbelief
[1:13:22] he says shame on you people that don't
[1:13:24] believe in music that brings the spirit
[1:13:26] of the lord sometimes god doesn't change
[1:13:28] if he liked it then he likes it now well
[1:13:30] you say i've got to live if you can't be
[1:13:32] elisha and we'll get there
[1:13:34] uh be the one of the instruments or be
[1:13:36] one of the minstrel strings then
[1:13:38] do something or do something for the
[1:13:40] lord because it altogether brought the
[1:13:42] spirit of god that's right
[1:13:44] the presence of the prophet and the
[1:13:46] playing of the minstrels
[1:13:48] and they began to play some good old
[1:13:49] hymn upon these stringed instruments and
[1:13:52] beat the tambourine
[1:13:53] and they got and they all got into the
[1:13:55] spirit you know what
[1:13:56] here's another thing now this is the
[1:13:58] prophet
[1:13:59] maybe well we won't read it but to save
[1:14:01] time that was second kings i believe
[1:14:03] three
[1:14:05] that there's the king second kings three
[1:14:06] we'll get to somewhere else some other
[1:14:08] time
[1:14:08] second kings three and ten and the king
[1:14:10] of israel said alas that the lord hath
[1:14:12] called these three kings together
[1:14:14] to deliver them into the hand of moab
[1:14:17] now
[1:14:18] god didn't do anything in this it was
[1:14:19] actually their own plans
[1:14:21] you know we can blame god for our own
[1:14:23] misfortune but get into the spirit first
[1:14:25] and then you'll be fine but jehoshaphat
[1:14:28] said
[1:14:28] is there not is there not here a prophet
[1:14:31] of the lord that we may inquire
[1:14:33] uh of the king of israel and sorry
[1:14:36] main choir of the lord by him and one of
[1:14:38] the king of israel's servant sajdah said
[1:14:41] here is elisha the son of shafat which
[1:14:43] poured water on the hands of elijah
[1:14:45] and jehoshaphat said the word lord is
[1:14:48] with him so the king of israel and
[1:14:50] jehoshaphat and the king of eden went
[1:14:51] down to him
[1:14:52] and elisha said unto the king of israel
[1:14:55] what have i
[1:14:56] to do with thee get thee to the prophets
[1:15:00] of thy father
[1:15:01] and to the prophets of thy mother and
[1:15:03] the king of israel said unto nay for the
[1:15:05] lord hath called these three kings
[1:15:07] together
[1:15:07] to deliver them into the hand of moab
[1:15:10] and elijah said as the lord of hosts
[1:15:11] liveth
[1:15:12] before whom i stand surely where were it
[1:15:15] not that i regard the presence of
[1:15:16] jehoshaphat the king of judah
[1:15:18] i would not look toward thee nor see
[1:15:20] thee so elisha was
[1:15:22] was was was fussy he was grumpy
[1:15:26] he says you know why don't you go talk
[1:15:28] to your your mama's prophets
[1:15:30] go talk to the prophets of baal it
[1:15:32] wasn't for this godly king i wouldn't
[1:15:33] even look at you
[1:15:34] so he's all kind of bound up and you
[1:15:36] know his righteous incarnation got the
[1:15:38] better of him
[1:15:39] but then elijah said is the lord of
[1:15:41] hosts liveth oh sorry verse
[1:15:43] verse 15. but now bring me a minstrel
[1:15:46] and it came to pass when the minstrel
[1:15:47] played that the hand of the lord
[1:15:49] came upon him so now if we all get bound
[1:15:52] up and fussy
[1:15:53] the spirit of god can't come upon us
[1:15:56] that's why we have a good trouble sunday
[1:15:58] morning maybe it's just my house maybe
[1:16:00] it's just me myself
[1:16:01] is the problem but you know but yeah or
[1:16:04] wednesday
[1:16:05] afternoon there's things that whenever
[1:16:07] an issue become a big issue
[1:16:09] this is going to be sorted right now and
[1:16:11] it's going to oh it's the end of all
[1:16:12] things no it's not the end of all things
[1:16:14] just put the cup there we'll be fine
[1:16:15] you know but you know but why it's
[1:16:17] because the dev once it's all tight and
[1:16:19] stressed
[1:16:20] they would come and sit down and church
[1:16:22] and then we're just this big thing like
[1:16:23] this
[1:16:24] and then by the end of the service ah
[1:16:26] then we finally relax but service is
[1:16:28] done
[1:16:29] why don't get all relaxed in the spirit
[1:16:32] before you walk into these doors
[1:16:34] amen i'll enter his gates with
[1:16:36] thanksgiving in my heart
[1:16:37] have a have have a song services you
[1:16:39] drive to church

[1:16:43] of them

[1:16:46] in the spirit before church even starts
[1:16:49] hallelujah amen so he says here
[1:16:53] and they begin i'll just repeat the
[1:16:55] first part here and they begin to play
[1:16:56] some good old hymn on these stringed
[1:16:58] instruments and beat the tambourine
[1:17:00] and they all got into the spirit you
[1:17:02] know what here's another thing
[1:17:04] him sitting there all stewed up about it
[1:17:07] is that or the other the spirit of god
[1:17:09] couldn't deal with him
[1:17:11] you've got to get away from that type of
[1:17:13] condition
[1:17:14] as i say don't be all like this in a
[1:17:17] million knots
[1:17:18] like some origami folder over a million
[1:17:21] times no
[1:17:22] just say it's the devil's course he's
[1:17:24] going to fight us
[1:17:25] of course you know we should expect it
[1:17:28] it's like summer should be hot winter
[1:17:29] should be cold it shouldn't be a
[1:17:31] surprise
[1:17:32] it's a season right but so i said of
[1:17:34] course the devil's gonna fight us
[1:17:36] before we come into these doors and i
[1:17:38] found before i came into the message i

[1:18:56] child of god

[1:19:02] before i entered this door that's not
[1:19:03] the real me

[1:19:06] of jesus christ cleanse me from those
[1:19:08] things
[1:19:09] amen you know jesus died that we could
[1:19:11] serve him
[1:19:12] that's why the blood was shed that we
[1:19:14] could serve him amen he doesn't allot
[1:19:16] our mistakes to us because of the blood
[1:19:18] sure we've got to confess our sins to
[1:19:20] him
[1:19:20] but he washed us in his blood that we
[1:19:23] could serve him
[1:19:24] hallelujah yeah the devil's just a
[1:19:27] hypocrite
[1:19:28] he transforms himself as an angel of
[1:19:30] light
[1:19:31] hypocrite because the real hymn is not
[1:19:34] an angel of light he's an angel of death
[1:19:37] amen but he tries to say you're the
[1:19:39] hypocrite no no satan you're the
[1:19:41] hypocrite

[1:19:46] you can leave
[1:19:47] someone needs your seat get out
[1:19:50] talking to the devil by the way amen so

[1:22:41] whoa oh my
[1:22:42] when knock somebody's hat off your head
[1:22:44] his head like that nobody says a word
[1:22:46] about it
[1:22:47] you know i remember sitting in the
[1:22:49] stands there in canterbury the rugby
[1:22:51] people would throw stuff in the air
[1:22:53] bottles and crazy stuff
[1:22:54] and paint themselves all different
[1:22:56] colors and yeah
[1:22:58] they did no one said a word about it no
[1:23:00] one said oh that guy's off oh that guy's
[1:23:01] too much in the deep end
[1:23:03] he's just he's just gone too much in the
[1:23:05] deeper you know he's been brainwashed
[1:23:06] and you know he's gone mad and
[1:23:08] oh whatever happened to that guy he was
[1:23:10] he had so much potential look what he's
[1:23:12] done
[1:23:12] no one says that they're like whoa they
[1:23:15] don't say praise the lord but they said
[1:23:16] they say praise the lord
[1:23:17] that one's really got something i wish i
[1:23:20] was like him
[1:23:22] that's how they are and when we come to
[1:23:24] church or yeah we become christians and
[1:23:25] people say oh they've just gone too far
[1:23:28] they've just gone fanatical about it you
[1:23:30] know they've gone overboard
[1:23:32] that's the devil brother m says here
[1:23:37] he says let me this is from the church
[1:23:40] age book
[1:23:40] now let me use another illustration
[1:23:42] suppose you need healing what does the
[1:23:44] word say
[1:23:45] well we have all read it countless times
[1:23:48] but did it not get in the spirit
[1:23:50] but did not get in the spirit when
[1:23:51] reading it did we ask god for a spirit
[1:23:54] to teach us the real truth of it if we
[1:23:56] did
[1:23:56] we would call the elders confess our
[1:23:58] sins this is this
[1:24:00] quote i was looking for be anointed and
[1:24:02] prayed for
[1:24:03] and that would be that it might not come
[1:24:06] immediately but in his spirit it's all
[1:24:08] over
[1:24:09] there is no other court of appeal god
[1:24:11] will fulfill his word oh we need to get
[1:24:13] in the spirit
[1:24:14] and when things and then things will be
[1:24:17] done don't go through the acts first get
[1:24:19] in the spirit and then go through the
[1:24:21] acts and watch what god will do
[1:24:23] have you ever noticed how the world gets
[1:24:25] into the spirit of things that are in
[1:24:26] the world
[1:24:27] they go to their ball games their
[1:24:28] sporting events and their dances they
[1:24:30] enter into the spirit of it
[1:24:32] they don't sit there like wall flowers
[1:24:33] all dried up sticks
[1:24:35] they enter right into the feel of things
[1:24:38] and become
[1:24:38] part of things oh how they hate
[1:24:40] christians
[1:24:41] for getting into the spirit of god's
[1:24:43] word they call us fanatics and holy
[1:24:46] rollers
[1:24:46] there is nothing they won't do to show
[1:24:49] their hatred and disapproval
[1:24:51] but ignore that you can expect it
[1:24:54] knowing where it's coming from just go
[1:24:57] on and get
[1:24:58] in the spirit of worship our spirit is
[1:25:01] clean it's fresh it's real
[1:25:02] it is sober and serious but nevertheless
[1:25:06] see some people are just sober and
[1:25:07] serious
[1:25:10] but nevertheless full of the joy of the
[1:25:12] lord
[1:25:13] the christian ought to be just as
[1:25:15] exuberant
[1:25:16] and full of his pleasure in the lord as
[1:25:19] the world is when it's savior's delights
[1:25:21] in its pleasure now in other words when
[1:25:24] italy ran
[1:25:26] and they won 100 meters and then they
[1:25:27] won the 100 meter i mean
[1:25:29] i mean the relay they didn't just finish

[1:25:45] shouting and they are praising what they
[1:25:47] are exuberant
[1:25:48] and what their champions had done but my
[1:25:51] champion
[1:25:52] i mean he went to calvary for me
[1:25:54] hallelujah he took my sins upon his
[1:25:56] shoulders
[1:25:57] the joy set before him was me redeemed
[1:25:59] washed in his blood made in his image
[1:26:01] hallelujah he says no man takes my life
[1:26:03] from me i light down
[1:26:04] i'll raise it back up again and he gave
[1:26:07] his last breath
[1:26:08] on the cross he says it was finished
[1:26:10] hallelujah then he ascended down
[1:26:12] and down and down to the regions of the
[1:26:13] lost went down after preaching the souls
[1:26:16] in prison
[1:26:16] he went to satan went in there busted
[1:26:19] the door open
[1:26:21] and satan thought oh i've won i've got
[1:26:23] you now i thought i had you with abel
[1:26:25] and with noah and
[1:26:26] different ones down but then jesus said
[1:26:29] shut up satan
[1:26:30] i'm sick of your jabba-jabba amen i'm in
[1:26:33] charge now my blood is still on the
[1:26:35] cross i've redeemed adam's fallen race
[1:26:37] i redeemed benjamin john glenn that day
[1:26:39] hallelujah hallelujah i pay for his sins
[1:26:42] now give me the keys of hell death and
[1:26:43] the grave i'm in charge
[1:26:45] grabs the keys boots him back down to
[1:26:47] hell and then he ascends up into
[1:26:48] paradise
[1:26:50] hallelujah that's better than olympic
[1:26:52] gold any day
[1:26:54] amen and then in paradise the doors come
[1:26:56] open his presence goes before him and
[1:26:58] hallelujah and they're having a
[1:26:59] testimony meeting for eons of time
[1:27:02] however long it was talking about the
[1:27:04] king of glory
[1:27:06] hallelujah can you imagine david's in
[1:27:08] the spirit
[1:27:09] and i've said this before but it just
[1:27:10] always strikes me he's yo he's anointed
[1:27:13] he just cries out lift the up you
[1:27:15] everlasting gates and open up the
[1:27:16] everlasting doors that the king of glory
[1:27:18] shall come in
[1:27:19] holy maybe himself or a scribe would pin
[1:27:22] it down
[1:27:23] spirit's there so strong and then he and
[1:27:25] he says though i walk through the valley
[1:27:27] of the shadow death i'll fear no evil
[1:27:29] hallelujah hallelujah and then he finds
[1:27:31] himself on his deathbed
[1:27:33] amen he's put the kingdom in order he's
[1:27:35] told solomon he's going to be king in
[1:27:36] different things
[1:27:38] and he breathes his last breath he goes
[1:27:40] to the valley of the shadow of death
[1:27:42] but there's one who is with him from a
[1:27:45] shepherd boy
[1:27:47] hallelujah amen that takes him he
[1:27:50] doesn't have to worry is it going to be
[1:27:51] okay he was taken by the hand
[1:27:53] he's transported into paradise
[1:27:55] hallelujah
[1:27:57] hallelujah and then he's there he begins
[1:28:00] to testify of things that happened down
[1:28:02] on earth
[1:28:02] i saw the king of glory hallelujah
[1:28:06] amen i saw the city and i saw the cry of
[1:28:09] the redeemed saying lift the up the
[1:28:10] everlasting gates and be
[1:28:11] lifted up the king of glory shall come
[1:28:13] in where is he
[1:28:15] because there's not one believer that
[1:28:16] wants that that doesn't want to see him
[1:28:18] we all want to see him hallelujah we
[1:28:21] felt his presence but i yeah i do feel
[1:28:22] love now i trust you're in the spirit
[1:28:24] hallelujah and then finally they're
[1:28:26] fellowshipping lazarus comes in for four
[1:28:29] days then goes out again
[1:28:30] holy john the baptist comes in before
[1:28:32] that says i baptize the lamb of god
[1:28:35] hallelujah they begin to rejoice what
[1:28:37] they are being exuberant
[1:28:39] holy they weren't just sitting down and
[1:28:41] talking about quotes and scriptures are
[1:28:43] dead falling away
[1:28:44] they're rejoicing about a living word
[1:28:46] because they lived out that word they
[1:28:47] were part of that word they are
[1:28:48] testifying
[1:28:49] of what they manifested in their day
[1:28:52] hallelujah
[1:28:53] hallelujah and then and then the thief
[1:28:55] comes in
[1:28:57] hallelujah i i see myself as him
[1:29:00] somehow my life came and was kind of
[1:29:03] just
[1:29:04] his life you think about his life you
[1:29:06] think a christian's life shouldn't be
[1:29:07] a thief condemned to die
[1:29:11] and god the footsteps of the righteous
[1:29:13] are ordered of the lord work that one
[1:29:14] out
[1:29:15] work that one out because he is
[1:29:16] righteous work that one out here he is a
[1:29:19] thief
[1:29:20] does all kinds of things maybe from a
[1:29:21] broken home who knows his background
[1:29:24] but then god actually engineers his
[1:29:26] steps
[1:29:27] to do these wicked things to stand in
[1:29:31] front of pilate on the same day
[1:29:33] jesus is crucified he just happened to
[1:29:35] be there
[1:29:36] he was in prison what do you think about
[1:29:39] it he ever put yourself there
[1:29:41] why was he crucified the day before or
[1:29:43] after the
[1:29:44] you know the next week no he just
[1:29:47] happened to be there
[1:29:48] in the same judgment hall as jesus
[1:29:51] hallelujah
[1:29:52] and he followed him up the hill he saw
[1:29:54] everything that was going on
[1:29:56] he wasn't scourged more than jesus was
[1:29:59] he didn't have a crown of thorns on
[1:30:01] there wasn't a big
[1:30:02] uh all the interest wasn't on this guy
[1:30:05] it was on this man
[1:30:06] of nazareth then finally he's pinned to
[1:30:09] the cross
[1:30:10] there's another thief on the other side
[1:30:13] and and there's a
[1:30:14] spirit there of ridicule
[1:30:18] and condemnation and the priest is
[1:30:21] standing around
[1:30:22] there's the disciples there crying and
[1:30:24] things but there's a priest there
[1:30:26] they're looking up in jesus face to
[1:30:27] finally maybe jesus wasn't too far off
[1:30:29] the ground i don't know how
[1:30:30] tall crosses were exactly but they said
[1:30:33] if you're really the king of israel
[1:30:35] if you're really the son of god take
[1:30:36] yourself off the cross
[1:30:38] prove it and he gets into the same
[1:30:40] spirit
[1:30:41] because this thief the other thief was
[1:30:44] making fun of jesus
[1:30:45] and this same thief was doing the same
[1:30:47] thing but then god and his sovereignty
[1:30:49] allowed him to look again
[1:30:52] and he saw that man with a crown of
[1:30:54] thorns the inscription over him
[1:30:55] and he's breathing his last he's
[1:30:57] struggling
[1:30:59] because crucifixion really is
[1:31:00] suffocation because you try and stand
[1:31:03] with your feet to hold up your body
[1:31:05] but you can't then your arms collapse
[1:31:06] like this and your diaphragm can't move
[1:31:08] so you can't breathe
[1:31:09] it's a struggle like this for hours and
[1:31:12] then so he's breathing his last you know
[1:31:14] because sometimes we read the scripture
[1:31:16] and we just hear jesus say father
[1:31:18] forgive them they don't know what they
[1:31:19] do
[1:31:19] just like some calm voice it wouldn't
[1:31:21] have been that way father
[1:31:23] forgive them and then so this thief
[1:31:27] looked again
[1:31:29] and he saw more than a man he saw the
[1:31:31] lamb of god
[1:31:32] maybe his parents told them about the
[1:31:34] messiah i don't know
[1:31:36] they said lord remember me when you come
[1:31:38] into my when you come into your kingdom
[1:31:42] god ordained his steps sometimes we
[1:31:45] think someone's life is very dark
[1:31:47] but god has them on a journey we have to
[1:31:50] believe he's they're going to come out
[1:31:51] of that journey
[1:31:52] we have to believe the lord is going to
[1:31:53] take them out of it see that's not
[1:31:55] that's why we don't look at their
[1:31:56] current step
[1:31:57] we look at where we believe they're
[1:31:58] going to end up that's why i've got to
[1:32:00] keep having faith
[1:32:01] amen you're not going to leave them in
[1:32:03] that predicament god
[1:32:05] you're going to bring them in hallelujah
[1:32:08] and then jesus looked at him and said
[1:32:09] today you'll be with me in paradise and
[1:32:11] then they come along
[1:32:14] and they break the thief's legs i don't
[1:32:17] know
[1:32:17] you know because jesus just gave up the
[1:32:19] ghost they come and break the thieves
[1:32:20] legs this man dies
[1:32:22] in horrible agony then he wakes up then
[1:32:24] he i would say wake up but
[1:32:26] he's in paradise he walks through the
[1:32:29] door
[1:32:31] holy hallelujah and then
[1:32:34] he begins to relate his testimony
[1:32:38] i was hanging right there i made fun of
[1:32:41] him like the other thief don't see him
[1:32:42] here that's beside the point
[1:32:44] but then he said today you'll be with me
[1:32:46] in paradise i'm here
[1:32:48] you're here where is he and then door
[1:32:51] comes open behind him
[1:32:53] hallelujah and then now jesus empties
[1:32:56] out he leads captivity captive
[1:32:58] ascends on high and then he begins to
[1:33:01] say
[1:33:02] come children let's go a little higher
[1:33:05] and then david when he was in his flesh
[1:33:07] and he was inspired saying lift the up
[1:33:09] you everlasting gates and be
[1:33:10] lifted up can let's just go back a bit
[1:33:13] can you imagine here's david
[1:33:14] he says my god my god why is that
[1:33:16] forsaken me
[1:33:18] they pass my hands and my feet and he's
[1:33:20] and as the holy ghost speaking through
[1:33:22] him first person
[1:33:23] like he's on the cross hallelujah and
[1:33:26] imagine now
[1:33:28] you've been inspired this and then the
[1:33:30] one who came to live that out
[1:33:32] steps through the door
[1:33:35] and then they're ascending on high they
[1:33:37] come to the great city
[1:33:38] and then david finds himself living out
[1:33:41] what he prophesied
[1:33:43] lift the up here for lasting gains and
[1:33:44] be lifted up that the king of glory
[1:33:46] shall come in
[1:33:47] and he's living the whole thing out
[1:33:49] hallelujah
[1:33:50] but do you think they were they weren't
[1:33:52] just what a noise
[1:33:55] you talk about an exuberant worship
[1:33:57] exuberant worship
[1:33:59] hallelujah but there was another
[1:34:01] exuberant worship
[1:34:03] 50 days after the crucifixion i mean
[1:34:06] there's 120 in the upper room
[1:34:08] i mean they've seen their lord crucified
[1:34:10] they've seen the term empty but they saw
[1:34:12] him rose again
[1:34:14] i mean he's a living christ amen thomas
[1:34:16] would put his hands in his side his
[1:34:18] your hands and his feet you know and and
[1:34:20] and the holes in jesus
[1:34:22] they'd say my lord and my god but they
[1:34:25] said wait
[1:34:26] in jerusalem to endured with power from
[1:34:27] on high hallelujah
[1:34:29] there they were in the upper room and
[1:34:31] you know brother man dramatize it you
[1:34:33] know that maybe
[1:34:35] maybe it's 45 days after the crucifixion
[1:34:38] see so he ascended on the 40th day
[1:34:40] maybe it's five days in when they're in
[1:34:41] the upper room maybe andrew gets up and
[1:34:43] says
[1:34:43] brothers i believe we've got it by faith
[1:34:46] you know i really i really believe a
[1:34:48] difference you know because we're in
[1:34:49] this nice atmosphere we're all believers
[1:34:51] here and
[1:34:52] you know you know and now but peter said
[1:34:54] no
[1:34:55] we have to wait until we're endured with
[1:34:58] power from on high
[1:34:59] there's got to be something coming to
[1:35:01] our lives brothers there's got to be
[1:35:02] something that comes into my life that
[1:35:04] when opposition comes i'm no longer a
[1:35:06] coward
[1:35:07] there's going to come a power into my
[1:35:08] life that when accusations come against
[1:35:10] me i cannot deny the lord
[1:35:12] anymore i need that power i don't
[1:35:15] believe i have it yet because something
[1:35:17] has not changed on the inside of the
[1:35:19] inside
[1:35:20] i mean it's the same thing with you and
[1:35:21] my friends this baptism of the holy
[1:35:23] ghost is
[1:35:24] real as a reality it makes us overcome
[1:35:27] the world it makes us not afraid to be a
[1:35:29] christian
[1:35:30] i mean it makes us not ashamed of the
[1:35:31] gospel and it gives us overcoming power
[1:35:34] that we
[1:35:34] will manifest the word i mean you see
[1:35:37] it's more than just having a desire to
[1:35:38] serve god
[1:35:39] but god has got to take you see it's
[1:35:41] more than just saying you believe the
[1:35:43] message
[1:35:45] brother abraham said in the token
[1:35:47] message they said but brother brahm
[1:35:49] we believe everything you've said he
[1:35:51] says that's good but that's just being
[1:35:53] able to read
[1:35:54] but many people take that oh praise the
[1:35:56] lord they've received the word they've
[1:35:57] really got the holy ghost
[1:35:59] no not necessarily because the life
[1:36:03] that's lived afterwards will be a
[1:36:05] manifestation of what they believe
[1:36:07] and it's not by human ability but god
[1:36:10] will come and live himself
[1:36:11] out of your eye amen that's what he said
[1:36:15] on the token see many people
[1:36:17] they get just a new spirit who knows
[1:36:19] some tongue from now ezekiel
[1:36:21] let's just go there shall we ezekiel 36
[1:36:25] i believe
[1:36:36] and we'll go from verse 24.
[1:36:49] here we are for i will take you from
[1:36:51] among the heathen has he taken you
[1:36:54] hallelujah you may be living in the same
[1:36:56] house at the same address but he's taken
[1:36:58] you
[1:36:58] from spiritual darkness into marvelous
[1:37:00] light glory
[1:37:03] i'll take you from among the heathen and
[1:37:05] gather you out of all countries and
[1:37:06] bring you into your own land
[1:37:08] what is the land that we dwell in the
[1:37:09] word this is our promised land
[1:37:13] amen then i'll sprinkle clean water upon
[1:37:16] you and you shall be clean
[1:37:18] and all your filthiness and from all
[1:37:20] your idols will i cleanse you
[1:37:22] i had a lot of idols in here
[1:37:26] but god just took a wrecking ball of his
[1:37:28] holy ghost and smashed it all down
[1:37:30] and it wasn't against my will see god
[1:37:32] won't come in against your will
[1:37:33] he won't force anything upon you you
[1:37:35] have to be willing that's why you've got
[1:37:36] to open your
[1:37:37] you know there was a couple of sundays
[1:37:38] ago christine said after the service was
[1:37:40] like the holy ghost was just flying
[1:37:41] around the church
[1:37:43] looking for a heart to enter into amen
[1:37:46] but brother brown says and it and he
[1:37:47] says in that message we
[1:37:48] we looked a few months ago but he says
[1:37:50] look he's moving around the church
[1:37:52] you just got to open yours fully
[1:37:54] surrender yourself and let him he's
[1:37:55] waiting
[1:37:55] he's waiting for someone to open
[1:37:57] themselves up that he'd come and dwell
[1:37:58] in them
[1:37:59] he's the same god now he's not a
[1:38:02] different one but you're gonna surrender
[1:38:03] this way we can't get all tense at all
[1:38:05] no
[1:38:06] just surrender in his presence
[1:38:13] i'll cleanse a new heart also will i
[1:38:15] give you and a new spirit will i put
[1:38:17] within you and i'll take away the stony
[1:38:19] heart out of your flesh
[1:38:20] so what that is is actually god actually
[1:38:22] makes us
[1:38:23] changes us that we believe the bible's
[1:38:25] actually true
[1:38:26] that's taking the hosts stony heart away
[1:38:28] giving you a heart of flesh
[1:38:30] but notice this and i'll put he says and
[1:38:32] i will
[1:38:33] give wait let's start a new a new heart
[1:38:36] will i also give you in a new spirit
[1:38:38] what is that that's a desire to serve
[1:38:40] god
[1:38:41] right many people stop there but the
[1:38:44] humanity catches up with them
[1:38:46] their fallen nature catches up with them
[1:38:49] we don't want to just get to that stage
[1:38:51] this is a this gospel is the gospel of
[1:38:54] the kingdom
[1:38:55] which is god dwelling in people that's
[1:38:57] why he died on calvary that he can dwell
[1:38:59] in you and i that's his purpose
[1:39:01] that's what he wants to do and i will
[1:39:04] put my spirit within you
[1:39:06] where in verse 27 and cause you to walk
[1:39:09] in my statutes
[1:39:11] and you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:39:13] them
[1:39:14] how's that done because he puts his
[1:39:16] spirit within us
[1:39:18] to that that that way you'll walk in my
[1:39:20] statures you shall keep my judgments and
[1:39:22] do them
[1:39:23] right that's what we need that's why
[1:39:25] i've said many times
[1:39:26] he has to be the christian in you that's
[1:39:28] the only way it can be is when his holy
[1:39:30] ghost comes in
[1:39:31] i mean then he actually fulfills the
[1:39:33] word so it's not just a desire many
[1:39:35] people can be
[1:39:36] so bound up in the world but say god
[1:39:37] sent a prophet i believe the message the
[1:39:39] bible's true
[1:39:40] but they need god to come in and change
[1:39:42] their change them that he dwells in them
[1:39:44] that the things their first birth their
[1:39:46] first nature the sins they had don't
[1:39:48] rule them anymore but they get delivered
[1:39:52] amen
[1:39:56] now but you got to get in the spirit
[1:40:01] that's so important now isaiah 61 and 3.
[1:40:04] wait i don't have the whole thing here
[1:40:05] he says here
[1:40:08] he says to appoint unto you and zion to
[1:40:10] give unto them beauty for ashes
[1:40:12] the oil of joy for mourning the garment
[1:40:15] of praise for the spirit of heaviness
[1:40:17] that they might be called the trees of
[1:40:18] righteousness the planting of the lord
[1:40:20] that he might be glorified he was a
[1:40:23] trait
[1:40:24] beauty for ashes the oil of joy for
[1:40:26] mourning see
[1:40:27] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[1:40:29] heaviness see we're gonna get into
[1:40:31] the spirit amen
[1:40:36] so now what happened on the day of
[1:40:38] pentecost as god came and dwelt in his
[1:40:40] church and gave them overcoming power
[1:40:43] not only over the devil but over
[1:40:46] themselves
[1:40:47] that god could actually take those 16
[1:40:50] elements of flesh
[1:40:51] i mean i mean you know they made up
[1:40:52] their flesh and gave them overcoming
[1:40:55] power
[1:40:55] over this flesh amen and that's a
[1:40:58] reality this
[1:40:59] this is not seven steps to conforming to
[1:41:01] overcoming by the power of your mind
[1:41:04] no he has to come in and be the
[1:41:06] overcomer in you
[1:41:09] amen he says and jesus keeps all
[1:41:12] uh all of his appointments this is after
[1:41:15] the seals and
[1:41:16] and there's one thing i want to speak
[1:41:18] about after this he says now there she
[1:41:19] was with her here this is the woman
[1:41:21] wiping
[1:41:22] jesus's feet she began to wipe his feet
[1:41:24] with it and dry his feet off she was
[1:41:26] scared to death
[1:41:27] and after all she picked up this bottle
[1:41:29] of ointment and she broke it
[1:41:31] and she tried to hit it and break it and
[1:41:33] pour it on his feet she was crying
[1:41:35] and every time she would cry she'd reach
[1:41:36] down and kiss his feet she got
[1:41:38] hysterically
[1:41:39] when you get in his presence it makes
[1:41:42] you hysterically
[1:41:43] i got hysterically any man ever gets
[1:41:46] into his presence that believes him and
[1:41:48] has faith in him
[1:41:49] it makes you hysterically amen
[1:41:53] on the day of pentecost when he come in
[1:41:55] the form of the holy ghost they got
[1:41:57] hysterically
[1:41:58] when you really believe it and you know
[1:42:01] and you recognize it's your opportunity
[1:42:02] and you're in his presence
[1:42:04] you are sure of it so he doesn't say
[1:42:07] this
[1:42:08] you know he says whenever we get into
[1:42:09] the presence of god this is how people
[1:42:12] act
[1:42:13] right see there's a there's a spirit in
[1:42:16] the land
[1:42:17] that's always been here of unbelief that
[1:42:20] wants to make the church cold
[1:42:21] formal and powerless to take the joy of
[1:42:24] god out of the church to take real
[1:42:25] spiritual worship out of the church
[1:42:27] to take god moving out of the church
[1:42:30] this is
[1:42:30] it's it's always been here and it's
[1:42:32] epitomized to me
[1:42:34] in the old denominations um probably all
[1:42:37] of them now
[1:42:38] cold formal worship going through a
[1:42:41] well you've got to have these many songs
[1:42:43] and then this and the preacher preaches
[1:42:44] 45 minutes and then you do this and then
[1:42:46] you do it
[1:42:47] it's so rigidly bound that god can't
[1:42:51] move
[1:42:52] and people sit there nothing against it
[1:42:54] but you know it's j
[1:42:56] you know just sitting there but you know
[1:42:58] it just becomes such a
[1:43:00] see it's what's happening on the inside
[1:43:01] that's the most important thing right
[1:43:03] but but it gets such a rigid coldness
[1:43:06] that god can't move
[1:43:08] that is not what this message has come
[1:43:10] to bring this message has come to bring
[1:43:12] a real joy
[1:43:14] a real shouting a real dance
[1:43:18] amen you take david dance under the
[1:43:20] blood of bulls and ghosts what about
[1:43:21] under the blood of jesus christ
[1:43:23] i mean the children of israel on the red
[1:43:24] sea she took miriam took up a tambourine
[1:43:26] began to dance
[1:43:28] she didn't care she saw her enemy dead
[1:43:30] she didn't care about what everyone else
[1:43:32] was doing
[1:43:33] and when she led the church hallelujah
[1:43:36] amen those on the day of pentecost glory
[1:43:38] filled their souls
[1:43:39] they couldn't just sit there and say now
[1:43:41] that was a good meeting and i liked that
[1:43:42] quote and what their brother said no god
[1:43:44] came down
[1:43:45] i mean filled them holy the promise that
[1:43:47] was that they'd received powerful on
[1:43:49] high he came
[1:43:50] in he really came and they busted out
[1:43:52] that place and the people said
[1:43:53] these people are filled with new ones oh
[1:43:56] no
[1:43:57] it wasn't some carnal thing you know the
[1:43:59] problem is there's so many scarecrows
[1:44:01] today
[1:44:02] but scarecrows scare
[1:44:05] crows they scare crows
[1:44:08] they don't scare eagles they may
[1:44:10] intimidate them for a little bit but why
[1:44:12] you know people are so against
[1:44:14] shouting and running the aisles you know
[1:44:17] if god is doing it it's always an order
[1:44:20] but people are so afraid the reason is
[1:44:22] people are afraid to let go and let god
[1:44:25] that's that's the thing but people are
[1:44:26] so against it all because well look what
[1:44:28] these people have done and look what
[1:44:29] this movement did and look
[1:44:31] that's a scarecrow who cares about what
[1:44:34] they did
[1:44:35] this is me and my god right who get you
[1:44:38] there was some years ago
[1:44:41] god moved in this country in a powerful
[1:44:43] way and i'm just going to say this is
[1:44:44] public
[1:44:45] you know there's a christine here
[1:44:48] holy ghost fell in her tongue's
[1:44:50] interpretation god moved in church as
[1:44:51] was prophesied
[1:44:53] and churches around begin to have
[1:44:54] meetings about does he is this right or
[1:44:56] not
[1:44:58] and that is and how could you ever ask
[1:45:00] that question maybe i'll get backlash
[1:45:02] first i don't care
[1:45:02] but you know why would you ever ask if
[1:45:04] something's in the scripture
[1:45:06] if god put something in the church
[1:45:08] that's the devil that tries to take it
[1:45:09] out of the church
[1:45:10] right so if god puts speaking in tongues
[1:45:12] of the church it's in the church
[1:45:14] if god put prophecy in the church it's
[1:45:15] in the church if god put the sermon in
[1:45:17] the church it's in the church
[1:45:18] if god put knowledge in the church it's
[1:45:20] in the church if god put gifts of
[1:45:22] healing in the church it's in the church
[1:45:23] if god puts helps and governments in the
[1:45:25] church it's in the church
[1:45:27] it's still in the church because we have
[1:45:30] been restored back to apostolic faith
[1:45:33] right we have not been restored back to
[1:45:35] lectures
[1:45:36] of some baptist theology of just a nice
[1:45:39] thought and just putting scriptures
[1:45:40] together with no life
[1:45:42] that's not what this message is no we're
[1:45:44] being restored back to the book of acts
[1:45:46] amen as not just saying oh the prophet
[1:45:48] did this the pillar of fire was with him
[1:45:50] what about with you and i
[1:45:52] that's the same jesus with him as the
[1:45:54] same jesus with you and i
[1:45:55] the same one that met the apostle paul
[1:45:57] we must meet as well
[1:45:58] as the same jesus hallelujah
[1:46:02] amen but i stand against that kind of
[1:46:04] spirit i don't care how many quotes i
[1:46:06] can have to back it up
[1:46:07] there's no there's no quote to back it
[1:46:09] up
[1:46:10] oh but this is a word revival what does
[1:46:12] the word produce
[1:46:14] the word the word opening never ever
[1:46:16] produces dead theology
[1:46:18] of just some nice mental understanding
[1:46:20] and putting quotes together and isn't
[1:46:21] that lovely no
[1:46:22] a word revival brings jesus on the scene
[1:46:25] that's a real word revival when jesus
[1:46:27] steps down
[1:46:28] i mean into his word and makes it live
[1:46:30] that's a word revival
[1:46:32] hallelujah amen that is a real revival
[1:46:37] that is a word of ah well we're in the
[1:46:39] we're in the eagle age
[1:46:41] yeah god doesn't take away he adds
[1:46:46] so the lutherans they were the just
[1:46:48] shall live by faith
[1:46:50] have we thrown that away then the method
[1:46:53] has come along
[1:46:54] sanctification living a holy life
[1:46:57] dressing right
[1:46:58] acting right speaking right you know all
[1:47:00] those things
[1:47:01] do we do we still do that do we still
[1:47:04] have a clothesline religion
[1:47:06] yeah we have a hole in it yeah we
[1:47:08] believe in holiness don't we
[1:47:10] we don't strip ourselves off and walk
[1:47:11] naked on the street no
[1:47:13] we live we believe in holiness amen so
[1:47:16] we
[1:47:17] still believe in but we believe in being
[1:47:18] justified by faith that we not
[1:47:20] it's not our works that any man should
[1:47:22] boast we are justified by our faith
[1:47:24] in the lord jesus christ so we believe
[1:47:27] in this we believe in holiness
[1:47:28] but then why do some people want to skip
[1:47:30] the restoration of the gifts
[1:47:32] and say but we have the word now brother
[1:47:34] no no no no
[1:47:36] god adds
[1:47:39] he restores if you're going to restore
[1:47:42] back
[1:47:42] you take what has been that's fallen
[1:47:44] down and rebuild it
[1:47:45] what did elijah do mount karmas is and
[1:47:47] he rebuilt the altar of the lord the
[1:47:50] altar of the lord was already there but
[1:47:51] it had fallen down
[1:47:52] it had to be restored here to take
[1:47:54] stones
[1:47:55] i say revelations of the word place them
[1:47:58] correctly
[1:47:59] then the sacrifice could go on then the
[1:48:00] fire could fall same thing with you and
[1:48:02] i you know revelation stones are placed
[1:48:05] in our lives
[1:48:07] repent that's a revelation be baptized
[1:48:09] in lord jesus christ the revelation
[1:48:11] give your whole life you know water
[1:48:13] baptism the seals all different things
[1:48:15] revelation
[1:48:16] but then you're gonna come to a place
[1:48:18] where's the sacrifice
[1:48:20] and god says you've got to present
[1:48:21] yourself a living sacrifice you've got
[1:48:23] to give yourself to this word
[1:48:25] that's what you got to do and so that's
[1:48:27] how the fire falls
[1:48:28] is not when you have a bunch of
[1:48:29] revelation stones without a sacrifice on
[1:48:31] it
[1:48:32] no you've got to climb on the wood
[1:48:34] you've got to present your whole life
[1:48:36] and then the fire falls hallelujah and
[1:48:38] what went on the altar doesn't stay
[1:48:40] there anymore because the fire comes
[1:48:41] down and burns it up
[1:48:42] it's the same thing with our carnal
[1:48:44] nature it doesn't stay it gets burnt up
[1:48:47] hallelujah amen i believe in
[1:48:50] maybe i've always been a pyromanic i
[1:48:51] don't know maybe i realize i just am
[1:48:53] right i love fire
[1:48:54] fire consumes fire cleanses fire burns
[1:48:57] up and i'm talking about holy fire
[1:49:00] hallelujah but people are against people
[1:49:02] are against this kind of thing and they
[1:49:04] say well
[1:49:05] that's very straightforward because
[1:49:08] we have that which is perfect now let's
[1:49:11] just let's just speak about that
[1:49:14] first corinthians 13 the apostle paul
[1:49:17] would say
[1:49:18] in verse nine four we know in part and
[1:49:19] we prophesy in part
[1:49:21] but when that which is perfect has come
[1:49:23] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:49:25] away
[1:49:26] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[1:49:28] understood as a child
[1:49:30] i thought as a child and then i became a
[1:49:32] man i put away childish things
[1:49:35] for now we see through a glass darkly
[1:49:37] but then
[1:49:38] face to face now i know in part but then
[1:49:41] shall i know even as i has known even as
[1:49:44] i am known
[1:49:45] and now and now abideth faith hope
[1:49:47] charity these three
[1:49:49] but the greatest of these is charity
[1:49:52] so he's saying that we know in part we
[1:49:54] prophesy in part
[1:49:55] but that when that which is purpose has
[1:49:57] come that in part shall be done away
[1:49:59] now what is the bit that's done away
[1:50:00] just the partial it goes to
[1:50:03] full right because a child
[1:50:06] understands partially speaks partially
[1:50:11] you know when they're about between two
[1:50:12] and three they just get real bent up
[1:50:14] frustration because they can't even get
[1:50:15] out a sentence
[1:50:17] but then they go from that i trust to a
[1:50:19] fully mature adult and they can actually
[1:50:21] articulate
[1:50:22] how they feel or what they want to
[1:50:23] convey so they could speak in part they
[1:50:25] could do in part when they become fully
[1:50:27] grown they do in the fullness
[1:50:30] you don't take away basic language when
[1:50:32] you become an adult
[1:50:35] you don't throw it away do you
[1:50:38] you know i still say i'm happy i said
[1:50:40] that when i was maybe this big
[1:50:44] but people have it in their mind oh that
[1:50:46] which is done in part is the gifts and
[1:50:48] we don't need that anymore because we're
[1:50:49] not children
[1:50:50] no it's all part of the body that's why
[1:50:53] brother brown people would challenge him
[1:50:54] saying you're trying to return the
[1:50:55] people back to an apostolic faith
[1:50:58] you know that's done away with that was
[1:50:59] with the apostles and he would just say
[1:51:01] god put it in the body god put it in the
[1:51:03] word show me where god took it out
[1:51:07] and then people go to questions and
[1:51:08] answers 1964
[1:51:10] and they'd say for first corinthians 13
[1:51:12] says when that which is perfect has come
[1:51:15] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:51:17] with so all these little things
[1:51:20] of jumping up and down like a kid trying
[1:51:23] to talk in tongues and all these
[1:51:25] other things when that which is perfect
[1:51:27] and we do have today by god's help the
[1:51:29] perfect interpretation of the word
[1:51:31] with divine vindication but notice he
[1:51:35] says
[1:51:35] and so all these little things of
[1:51:36] jumping up and down like a kid
[1:51:39] trying to talk in tongues we don't try
[1:51:41] and talk in tongues
[1:51:42] we let god talk in tongues through us i
[1:51:44] mean we don't jump up and down like kids
[1:51:46] because we have a full understanding
[1:51:48] we're redeemed
[1:51:50] right we can know we can no more die
[1:51:53] than god can die
[1:51:54] we're eternal as god is eternal my sins
[1:51:56] are being washed in the blood of calvary
[1:51:59] i am a free born son of god
[1:52:02] i'm going in a rapture hallelujah so i'm
[1:52:04] not just jumping like a kid
[1:52:06] i know her who i am i know i've been
[1:52:08] washing the blood of the lamb and that
[1:52:10] allows me to jump because i have a full
[1:52:12] i've got a theophany body hallelujah
[1:52:15] that if
[1:52:16] this this heart stops beating it's
[1:52:19] already there waiting for me
[1:52:20] i've heard from that theophany that's
[1:52:22] why this message came my way
[1:52:24] god's telling me child you've got a
[1:52:25] theophany you're going to step into
[1:52:27] hallelujah so i'm not just jumping like
[1:52:29] a kid
[1:52:31] because everyone else is doing because
[1:52:32] it's fun i can jump with understanding
[1:52:35] hallelujah see but then
[1:52:39] the dead baptists of the message want to
[1:52:41] take this and say well we just do away
[1:52:43] with that kind of thing
[1:52:44] no they're misplacing the word
[1:52:47] oh we've matured no
[1:52:54] people mistake maturity for actually
[1:52:56] drying up and dying
[1:53:01] god help us i've very
[1:53:04] much put myself in that boat that i
[1:53:06] don't dry up and die
[1:53:09] oh i'm mature now i'm stable in my walk
[1:53:12] no no hold on instability
[1:53:16] is very different to being happy in
[1:53:18] emotional and heartfelt religion
[1:53:24] so we still have the gifts of the spirit
[1:53:27] and quite frankly
[1:53:28] i pray it happens more oh but it might
[1:53:32] not be the right spirit
[1:53:33] why are we so afraid of the devil
[1:53:37] who are we giving who are we opening
[1:53:39] ourselves to you've got to be very
[1:53:40] conscious lord if it's you
[1:53:42] speak if it's not don't speak or however
[1:53:44] he wants to minister because not all of
[1:53:45] us speak in tongues
[1:53:46] not all of us prophesy not all of us
[1:53:48] interpret it's in the body
[1:53:50] right but some people are so afraid oh
[1:53:52] people are afraid of wildfire
[1:53:54] i'd rather have some fire than no fire
[1:53:56] and but i'm but i'm qualifying that as i
[1:53:58] want the fire of god
[1:54:01] right people say well it's just a bunch
[1:54:03] of steam coming out the whistle well
[1:54:04] it's good to have it's good to have
[1:54:06] steam come out the whistle because that
[1:54:07] means there's a fire burning in the
[1:54:09] engine
[1:54:10] it's not just a cold swept out oven with
[1:54:11] nothing in it no there's fuel in there
[1:54:13] there's fire
[1:54:15] hallelujah i'd rather have that because
[1:54:18] eventually
[1:54:19] eventually it will actually go into
[1:54:20] motion
[1:54:22] but i'd rather just have a whole bunch
[1:54:24] of steam going out the whistle
[1:54:26] at first hallelujah you understand what
[1:54:29] i mean
[1:54:30] but people are all what about this what
[1:54:31] no we shouldn't be afraid of
[1:54:33] who cares what the pentecostal move has
[1:54:36] done
[1:54:36] with the gifts that shouldn't even be
[1:54:39] our
[1:54:40] it shouldn't come into our equation
[1:54:42] right are we
[1:54:43] are we all in agreement nobody said
[1:54:45] scarecrow scare
[1:54:47] crows right brother braham said
[1:54:51] where he was planting butter beans
[1:54:54] and he tried to make a little scarecrow
[1:54:56] to scare was a gopher or a groundhog i
[1:54:58] think it was a groundhog
[1:54:59] so he drew a little monster thing on a
[1:55:02] bit of paper and put it on the thing
[1:55:03] he said boy that was scary if you could
[1:55:04] see how i draw now
[1:55:07] but there was a hunger in this groundhog
[1:55:10] for butter beans
[1:55:12] so when he came out of his hole he saw
[1:55:13] the scarecrow
[1:55:15] he was a bit intimidated by it but he
[1:55:17] watched it
[1:55:18] and moved with the wind he kind of
[1:55:19] backed off but he came looked again
[1:55:21] because he's got a hunger see
[1:55:22] he's got a hunger he had a hunger for
[1:55:24] the reality of those butter beans
[1:55:25] he wasn't interested in just looking at
[1:55:27] the butter beans from afar he wanted to
[1:55:29] taste them
[1:55:30] not to fill his belly hardly there god
[1:55:32] have a good snooze afterwards
[1:55:33] they meant to he had a hunger so he
[1:55:35] looks at this thing and it moves but you
[1:55:37] know then he kind of taps it it rattles
[1:55:39] he jumps off
[1:55:40] taps it again rattle rattle he realizes
[1:55:42] that thing can't hurt him he just runs
[1:55:43] around it starts feeding his belly
[1:55:45] full of the reality of what he wanted
[1:55:48] shouldn't that be the same thing with us
[1:55:49] in the spirit of god
[1:55:50] hallelujah sure there's a bunch of
[1:55:52] scarecrows around but there should be a
[1:55:53] hunger
[1:55:54] lord i want to see you live in a greater
[1:55:57] way
[1:55:57] i want to see the realities of god i
[1:56:00] mean all that you
[1:56:01] are i want to see manifested in my life
[1:56:03] hallelujah i don't i don't want to
[1:56:05] just be so bound up and trying to no
[1:56:07] we're trying to be too human
[1:56:09] we should let go and let god have his
[1:56:11] way hallelujah
[1:56:14] amen amen it's just a mockery
[1:56:20] of the real holy ghost but remember
[1:56:23] there's got to be a genuine before there
[1:56:24] can be a counterfeit
[1:56:26] right counterfeits to never come before
[1:56:28] the genuine
[1:56:29] right so if there's a mockery there's a
[1:56:31] genuine somewhere
[1:56:32] amen and brother bam says why would you
[1:56:34] want to take a substitute when the
[1:56:36] skies are full of the pentecostal
[1:56:38] blessing so you can say right above us
[1:56:40] is the fullness of
[1:56:41] all that god is all the blessings are
[1:56:43] there why take a substitute
[1:56:46] of just adopting a creed you know
[1:56:47] there's a lot of creeds in the message
[1:56:50] right there's a lot of creeds of just
[1:56:51] rattling off quotes and i believe and
[1:56:53] you know it's like it's like the
[1:56:54] apostles creed i believe william branham
[1:56:55] was the prophet of god for this hour
[1:56:57] malachi 4 to fulfill this and this and
[1:56:58] this
[1:56:58] they can just become like the apostles
[1:57:00] creed just saying something
[1:57:02] it's not it's not that it's but that's
[1:57:04] trying to substitute a new birth
[1:57:06] because people brother and sisters are
[1:57:08] afraid of a new birth they're trying to
[1:57:09] substitute
[1:57:10] with handshaking church joining but it's
[1:57:12] none of those things
[1:57:13] it's when you really meet god
[1:57:16] and brother braham says that the only
[1:57:18] kind the only kind the work can bring
[1:57:21] forth is the same that it did in the
[1:57:23] book of acts
[1:57:24] blabbering crying hooping snotting
[1:57:28] shouting a bunch of people acting like a
[1:57:29] bunch of drunks that's the
[1:57:31] kind of the word brought forth first and
[1:57:34] that's the only kind
[1:57:36] that the people want acts 238 tongue
[1:57:38] speaking shouting yangons around her
[1:57:40] but a lot of people say well that would
[1:57:42] certainly embarrass me no that would do
[1:57:44] me real proud
[1:57:46] hallelujah that'll do me real proud
[1:57:49] amen yes she don't want any whooping
[1:57:51] crying screaming hallelujah amen why
[1:57:53] such a child
[1:57:54] would immediately put her out of her
[1:57:55] denomination they had one like that and
[1:57:57] one of the churches why they'd
[1:57:59] throw her out right quick why are you
[1:58:01] lending such stuff as that going along
[1:58:02] see you see
[1:58:03] she's pregnant with something because
[1:58:05] she's bringing forth members all the
[1:58:06] time but she don't want none of them
[1:58:08] screaming
[1:58:09] holland blabyrin acts 238 miserable
[1:58:12] creatures
[1:58:13] she thinks they are it would certainly
[1:58:14] embarrass her it would ruin her
[1:58:16] and her educated ethical scientific
[1:58:18] society church
[1:58:19] that she belonged to here they would
[1:58:21] throw her out at the next council you
[1:58:23] can't
[1:58:24] she can't have it so she don't want to
[1:58:26] be pregnant with the word
[1:58:27] because that's the only kind the word
[1:58:30] can bring forth
[1:58:31] born of the spirit it has a spirit of
[1:58:33] god in it no intellectual church
[1:58:34] join a creed going bob head paint face
[1:58:37] there's no such a thing and all of that
[1:58:39] you don't find it in the word of god you
[1:58:41] find an old-fashioned sanctified holy
[1:58:43] ghost-filled child
[1:58:44] born of the spirit of god screaming
[1:58:46] hollering shouting praising god
[1:58:48] that's from the invisible union of the
[1:58:49] bride 1965 should you worry about such a
[1:58:52] detail
[1:58:53] so we have been restored yeah and people
[1:58:56] say well
[1:58:56] we don't want to be anointed
[1:59:00] well you look at the scripture you know
[1:59:02] the anointing is for the wheat
[1:59:05] right the anointing is for the wheat
[1:59:07] it's not for the tears
[1:59:08] but people look at the tears and see
[1:59:09] what they do and they say oh we don't
[1:59:11] want that kind of thing no
[1:59:12] we have to be anointed there are or what
[1:59:15] about false anointed ones false christs
[1:59:17] in the last day matthew 24 there shall
[1:59:19] be false christs in the last day
[1:59:21] christ means anointed one but everyone
[1:59:24] is an anointed one in the last day
[1:59:26] it depends if you're true or you're
[1:59:29] false the same holy ghost falls on both
[1:59:31] remember
[1:59:32] but then the world is anointed too right
[1:59:35] brother ram says that the
[1:59:36] speaking of the you know elvis presley
[1:59:38] pat bernie says
[1:59:39] those that kind of music released from
[1:59:41] those judases of this hour
[1:59:43] will take the world to the battle of
[1:59:45] armageddon
[1:59:46] why because there's a spirit on that
[1:59:48] music that will take the world
[1:59:49] there what they're anointed the world is
[1:59:52] anointed
[1:59:53] what about the bride of christ we should
[1:59:56] be the anointed one of the last day
[1:59:59] right filled with the spirit of god so
[2:00:01] don't worry about what the tears do
[2:00:03] or what these ones do who cares no the
[2:00:05] anointing is for me
[2:00:07] the anointing is for the bride
[2:00:09] hallelujah so we should get in the
[2:00:11] spirit
[2:00:12] hallelujah and not just in church but
[2:00:14] every day we should get in the spirit
[2:00:16] and help us you know but every morning
[2:00:20] what should we do when we get up get in
[2:00:21] the spirit
[2:00:22] commit our ways to the lord praise him
[2:00:24] give him glory walk on with god
[2:00:26] hallelujah i believe we should do that
[2:00:30] help us now to do it amen so now
[2:00:34] why are you saying all this i'm saying
[2:00:37] all this
[2:00:38] because we have a god of reality and we
[2:00:42] shouldn't settle for second best of just
[2:00:44] going through emotion
[2:00:45] you know our children deserve to see
[2:00:48] god move and they actually deserve to be
[2:00:51] anointed with the holy ghost
[2:00:53] i would love it we tell the girls
[2:00:55] actually we'd love to see them shout and
[2:00:56] scream under the anointing
[2:00:58] hallelujah that make me real happy i
[2:01:01] meant to see them run the olds and
[2:01:02] scream and say you're real god you're
[2:01:04] real

[2:01:07] but for me isn't that what we want
