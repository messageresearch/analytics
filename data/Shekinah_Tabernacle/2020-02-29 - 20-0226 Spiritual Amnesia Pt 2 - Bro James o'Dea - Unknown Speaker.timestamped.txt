[16:01] us tonight I just pray that you just
[16:05] left the lid off your word Lord just
[16:08] pour your blessings out upon us the
[16:09] congregation Lord they both congregation
[16:13] and Minister receive from you tonight
[16:15] thank you thank you please put my
[16:25] slideshow over you know it's a beautiful
[16:31] day to day the Sun was shining as a
[16:34] lovely day and lower hutt and I just
[16:38] enjoy it you know everything's going
[16:40] good at the moment I think the city's in
[16:43] a real good financial time and works
[16:45] going good plenty of work plenty of jobs
[16:48] not hard to find a job hard to find a
[16:50] house but it's just a really nice time
[16:53] everything's going right there hasn't
[16:55] really been any major tribulations it's
[16:58] just going good and sometimes when
[17:00] things are going good we can begin to
[17:03] relax a little bit so tonight I've just
[17:05] got a little bit of a study that the
[17:08] Lord's been dealing with and just want
[17:11] to express what the Lord's been showing
[17:13] to me you know the ministers would know
[17:15] sometimes you study and you're like
[17:16] can't wait to preach this and then you
[17:18] go to put something down and the Lord
[17:20] sees no you're not gonna preach that
[17:22] you're gonna go down the seven-year huh
[17:23] oh just follow what the Lord's got to
[17:26] say so if you turn to Jeremiah 8 first 7
[17:32] or you can read it up on the board
[17:47] I love the Book of Jeremiah and I've
[17:49] just been spinning some real timely and
[17:52] it reads 8 verse 7
[17:54] yeah the stork in heaven knoweth her
[17:57] appointed times and the turtle and the
[17:59] crane and the swallow observed the time
[18:01] of their coming but my people know not
[18:04] the judgment of the Lord so the prophet
[18:10] saying here how is it that you don't
[18:12] recognize what's going on around you
[18:16] look at nature nature recognizes
[18:19] remember in the earthquakes come the
[18:21] cattle move away from the fence because
[18:23] they've recognised the sign that's given
[18:25] for those animals and there's been a
[18:27] sign given for humans to recognize the
[18:30] time they love them and it was important
[18:33] right through each church age that the
[18:35] people living in that church age
[18:37] recognized what was taking place and
[18:39] near time and gave the appropriate
[18:41] response so I want to go to another
[18:45] scripture here just to bring this out
[18:48] Genesis 6 verse 5
[19:08] and God saw that the wickedness of man
[19:11] was great in the earth and that and that
[19:14] every imagination of the thoughts of his
[19:16] heart was only evil continually and it
[19:20] repented the Lord that he had made man
[19:22] on the earth and it grieved him at its
[19:24] heart and the Lord said I will destroy
[19:27] man whom I have created from the face of
[19:29] the earth both man and beast and the
[19:32] creeping thing and the fowls of the air
[19:34] for it repenteth me that I have made
[19:35] them for God's angry at what mans done
[19:39] and now if we drop down to verse 11 and
[19:44] he says the earth also was corrupt
[19:48] before God and the earth was filled with
[19:51] violence and God looked upon the earth
[19:53] and behold it was corrupt for all flesh
[19:55] had corrupted his way upon the earth and
[19:58] God said unto Noah the end of all flesh
[20:00] has come before me for the earth is
[20:02] filled with violence through them and
[20:04] behold I will destroy them with the
[20:07] earth so he's dealing now with the
[20:10] condition of man and also the condition
[20:12] of the earth and it's come up to this
[20:15] time back in that day that has got to be
[20:18] destroyed and we come up to that time
[20:20] again and this age let's just pray
[20:25] Heavenly Father we just pray Lord that
[20:28] you just add the blessings to your word
[20:29] Lord and just you move the lips father
[20:32] Lord I'm just insufficient law just sir
[20:34] just human flesh Lord just like our
[20:36] Prophet was human flesh law but yet your
[20:39] word remains Lord Jesus your word still
[20:41] speaks and Lord we want to hear what you
[20:44] have to say we come at the service to
[20:46] you in Jesus name Amen you may be seated
[20:55] I'm thankful to be have it actually
[20:57] stand here with a voice because the
[21:00] devil has just fought me and started
[21:03] bringing this sickness on me and it was
[21:05] the same feeling of sickness I had when
[21:07] we were sick over Christmas for this
[21:09] flu-like symptom and as its throat just
[21:12] hurt for days and like no I'm not taking
[21:14] this out Satan always tries us I don't
[21:18] know what brother Ben must go through
[21:20] every week I know and I've been fighting
[21:23] the devil and and the Lord's been
[21:25] healing me it's the fastest I've ever
[21:27] been able to suppress a cold it's almost
[21:30] like it's not even there
[21:31] praise God last time when I spoke about
[21:36] the spiritual amnesia we were talking
[21:40] about searching our own hearts for those
[21:42] little seats that that can just raise up
[21:45] and that can affect your walk with the
[21:47] Lord and I just felt that it was undone
[21:51] and I just I don't really like preaching
[21:54] these sorts of things but I just felt
[21:57] like someone's not recognized it and and
[22:00] it's such an important thing just the
[22:02] condition of the world and it's just my
[22:05] work my work colleague today was saying
[22:08] to me telling me a testimony about he
[22:10] would almost hit a car crash it's two
[22:13] young kids in the car and he said it
[22:15] made me think to myself he just managed
[22:18] to avoid this hundred kilometer
[22:20] collision and was one mérida wing mirror
[22:22] with the other car and he said you know
[22:25] I thought to myself if that had it been
[22:27] up would I have been happy and that can
[22:31] be what it can be like for us if your
[22:33] time was called right now what what
[22:36] would happen where would you be
[22:41] and we've come to this time again with
[22:44] that condition that was coming up under
[22:46] the Noah's day in their antelopian
[22:48] destruction we're in the same condition
[22:51] now shocking so you can say yeah I see
[22:55] it I see but where's the action in our
[22:57] lives and response to what we see
[23:00] because that's what we're talking about
[23:02] now and that's when it comes down to
[23:04] home and that's where it starts getting
[23:06] you know I said to brother Ben are just
[23:08] checking there's no tomatoes under the
[23:10] sound desk back there it's a day that we
[23:13] should be running to God when we see
[23:14] evil we should run to God we certainly
[23:17] shouldn't run to the things and partake
[23:19] because to become a partaker of what's
[23:22] happening out there though it looks good
[23:24] and look good to Eve - but to be a
[23:27] partaker is to also be partaker of the
[23:30] punishment for it I've got lots of
[23:34] Scripture and lots of quotes tonight
[23:35] it's just the way the Lord's lead me for
[23:37] this so you'll just have to bear with me
[23:39] barman Gilead these people today it's
[23:46] just like this a man dying on the
[23:48] doorsteps of a doctor's office when the
[23:51] doctor in the building has the cure for
[23:53] the disease but he refuses to take it if
[23:56] the man has a disease and the doctor has
[23:59] the cure fruit and the man lay on the
[24:01] doctors doorsteps but if he refused to
[24:04] take his medicine he will die on the
[24:07] doorstep you can't blame the doctor the
[24:09] doctor would give him the medicine that
[24:11] would cure him if he had only come and
[24:13] take it but it isn't the doctors fault
[24:16] he's got the remedy but the man's too
[24:19] stubborn to take it then whose fault is
[24:21] it so it is today that many people die
[24:25] in the front of the church on the steps
[24:27] and the pews die in their sins because
[24:30] they refuse to accept God's Barnet's and
[24:32] Gilead they die in their sins because
[24:35] they refuse it not because there isn't
[24:37] any they just refused to take it
[24:40] help us long this is interesting Ben
[24:45] what will they take if they refuse that
[24:48] in what will they take they have to take
[24:51] something false instead it's not because
[24:54] there's none near because there is but
[24:56] men and woman just refused to take it
[24:58] and then they died died and the church
[25:00] said in the meeting meetings and listen
[25:02] night after night to inspire prophets of
[25:04] God who takes the word fearlessly and
[25:06] lays it out he must be born again
[25:09] men and woman sit in the pews and die
[25:11] and sink into utter despair and
[25:13] annihilated from God not because there's
[25:16] no grace and salvation but because they
[25:19] refuse
[25:20] to receive it rather been preachers and
[25:23] just lays it out and I can only imagine
[25:26] that I don't know I just imagine as a as
[25:29] a pastor and you know your congregation
[25:32] not like a minister does but you you you
[25:34] know your congregation and you preach
[25:36] service after service and you maybe you
[25:39] just pray I wish they would get it I
[25:41] wish they would get it or was maybe
[25:42] someone he's dealing with but people
[25:45] just sit there and it's like the word
[25:47] doesn't affect them what's wrong why
[25:49] hasn't the word affect them what's
[25:51] coming that's blocking the channel
[25:53] because there's something blocking in
[25:55] the channel is there no balm in Gilead
[25:58] then why is the daughter of my people so
[26:00] sick isn't there a physician near to
[26:03] minister this sure there is God has his
[26:06] prophets God had his barn yet and God's
[26:10] daughter as sick and she hasn't
[26:12] recovered but it isn't because there's
[26:14] no bomb there isn't because that there
[26:16] is no prophet but because the daughter
[26:18] refused to take the medicine that's true
[26:22] what's been done in this generation
[26:24] what's been done through revelation 10
[26:27] verse 7 it's not something that's been
[26:29] done in secret
[26:31] something that's been done behind a
[26:33] closed door with this little group
[26:35] coming under some train bridge where the
[26:36] coming of the Lord was it's not like
[26:39] it's been hidden it's been in plain view
[26:41] no cults do things behind doors and yet
[26:44] we get blamed of accused of being over
[26:47] you're just a cult no come see look this
[26:50] is all open there's no it's no cult
[26:52] about this denominations are cult the
[27:02] work that he does in your heart is a
[27:03] private work right it's a private work
[27:07] no one can see what he comes and does in
[27:09] your heart but then everybody sees what
[27:11] he does in your heart because what he
[27:12] does in your heart then comes out and
[27:15] then everyone sees it so after all it's
[27:17] not a secret work that's just a secret
[27:20] between you and God
[27:21] hey meanne jesus never did in anything
[27:24] in private and the people back then had
[27:27] no excuse and go to John 18 19 and
[27:33] high priests then asked Jesus of his
[27:36] disciples and of his doctrine jesus
[27:39] answered him I spake openly to the world
[27:41] I ever taught in the synagogue and in
[27:44] the temple whether the Jews always
[27:46] resort and in secret I have said nothing
[27:49] why ask us tell me asked him which heard
[27:52] me what I have said unto them behold
[27:54] they know what I have said and when he
[27:57] had thus spoken one of the officers
[27:58] which stood by struck Jesus with the
[28:01] palm of his hand saying answer they'll
[28:04] the high priest so that's happened today
[28:06] it's happened today
[28:08] yeah jesus answered if I have spoken any
[28:11] evil be a witness of the evil but of
[28:14] well why smite us now me and I've just I
[28:18] just see that this has happened in this
[28:20] age for a prophet brother Brennan never
[28:22] spoken secret he never spoke any evil of
[28:25] anyone it's the most humble man I've
[28:26] ever heard speak but he was reticle
[28:30] ridicule people don't you remember that
[28:32] man someone said there's no such thing
[28:36] as a miracle and he said if any man can
[28:38] come to me and prove that there's such
[28:39] thing as a miracle I'll give him a
[28:40] thousand dollars so brother Brennan
[28:42] gathered together a heap of witnesses
[28:44] and they went there and they said this
[28:46] man was healed here's a doctor that
[28:48] diagnoses Kasey's Hill and the man said
[28:51] he said was a thousand dollars and the
[28:53] man said well we don't have it it's in
[28:55] some other state brother owns ok let's
[28:57] go get it and that man said to him I'll
[29:00] tell you what you will go there and I'll
[29:03] take a little girl and I'll cut her arm
[29:05] and you hear what is wrong with people
[29:09] that come under the spirit of Satan to
[29:12] cut cut someone and they're ridiculing
[29:15] him of evil crazy
[29:22] they're just Pharisees of this day but
[29:27] no one would dare
[29:29] no one would dare to to challenge the
[29:31] presence of God when he was here right
[29:33] everyone wants to challenge the
[29:35] challenge all that the serpent seed and
[29:37] challenge all these different doctrines
[29:39] today well that's not right actually we
[29:41] take the scripture it's not right but
[29:43] why didn't they do it when the Prophet
[29:45] was here because he openly he put in
[29:47] newspaper articles all you brothers all
[29:50] you ministers you come here and we'll
[29:52] have a debate and we'll talk about
[29:54] serpents see we'll talk about
[29:56] predestination we'll talk about the
[29:58] baptism and not one person beard to
[30:01] challenge them openly because they knew
[30:03] they couldn't fight the word but they
[30:05] were bound to their thoughts through
[30:06] their denomination shame on them I see
[30:14] I've added some pictures for the kids
[30:22] God doesn't call a man to judgment
[30:25] without first warning him well you can't
[30:29] do nothing with the church it's so
[30:31] formal and gone there's nothing left
[30:33] they've done sold out their birth rights
[30:35] for a mess of pottage and they're just
[30:37] waiting judgment the Holy Spirit has
[30:40] crossed this nation showing his signs
[30:42] and wonders and they continually spurn
[30:44] his grace
[30:45] he's a vindicated himself improves his
[30:49] great of indication that he's the Word
[30:51] of God manifested in this day and they
[30:54] still turn it down see there's nothing
[30:56] left now you just can't always do that
[31:00] you mean you you just can't always do
[31:03] that you mean there was a time where you
[31:05] could do that he's starting to show that
[31:09] if something that's happened that you
[31:11] just can't always do that we're going to
[31:14] try and bring this out and Luke 12 verse
[31:19] 10 that's it and whosoever shall speak a
[31:22] word against the Son of man it shall be
[31:24] forgiven him but unto him that blaspheme
[31:27] against the Holy Ghost that shall not be
[31:30] forgiven there's something serious that
[31:34] can take place there's actually
[31:37] something that you can do that there can
[31:38] be no forgiveness for so serious and
[31:44] when when brother Branham came and he
[31:47] preached those seals and there was the
[31:49] opening of the word coming forth and
[31:51] Christ was working through his flesh
[31:53] people could blaspheme the man they
[31:56] could cut down on brother Brad and there
[31:58] was forgiveness there's been many people
[32:00] throughout and the and message ministers
[32:03] that fought against the message fought
[32:04] against brother Brennan but there was
[32:07] forgiveness for that but to challenge
[32:09] the God displaying himself it's a
[32:13] different story and we had come to a
[32:18] point of time where you could no longer
[32:20] reject this message well look at there's
[32:24] some why price speak and I'm going to
[32:28] pick this back up later because as I was
[32:30] going through the study the Lord brought
[32:31] something out and I thought well this
[32:33] really is important and he said a man
[32:38] picked up a picture of the angel of the
[32:39] Lord the other day a Baptist minister
[32:42] and laughed at her see that's blasphemy
[32:44] see there's no forgiveness for that no
[32:48] forgiveness for that for blaspheming the
[32:49] angel of the Lord in that picture that's
[32:53] what Jesus said it's blasphemy when you
[32:55] see it doing the very works that Christ
[32:57] did and he said when they see the works
[33:00] in Christ he was the sacrifice and they
[33:03] caught him belzebub a devil because he
[33:06] was doing it and now they and now they
[33:10] say he said I forgive you for that but
[33:12] when the Holy Ghost comes to do the same
[33:14] thing you speak a word against it and it
[33:17] will never be forgiven you in this world
[33:19] or the world to come see if you ever
[33:23] questioning things of the message I take
[33:26] the attitude if I don't understand
[33:27] there's been things when I come into
[33:29] this me so DOS don't understand I just
[33:31] couldn't see it I couldn't see how the
[33:32] Scriptures fit and instead of doing all
[33:35] that's false I just said Lord you answer
[33:37] it in your time sometimes I just come
[33:39] like the next day and be like open and
[33:42] this stuff there's some things that set
[33:44] there for maybe two years and I just
[33:46] left and there's still one thing at the
[33:48] moment that I would like the law to
[33:50] reveal more on but it's not even
[33:52] important but I know in his time and
[33:53] he'll reveal it to me right now it seems
[33:56] like a contradiction but I had so much
[33:58] faith in this message and in this
[34:00] prophet that I know that I just don't
[34:02] see it yet so you've better to just wait
[34:04] on it even if you start falling away
[34:07] from the message don't just say oh well
[34:08] maybe I don't see eye to eye but don't
[34:10] go and head against the message because
[34:12] that's dangerous
[34:16] but yet when the people see you today
[34:19] and they see Christ manifesting through
[34:21] your life hey why do they hate it
[34:24] are you doing evil you're doing evil to
[34:28] them are you doing good why do they hate
[34:30] it because a seed in them has to
[34:32] manifest they hate the way you dress
[34:35] right
[34:36] they hate the way you have your hair
[34:38] you're like this oddball you know and
[34:42] then lately we seen we pulled up next to
[34:44] this work fan trades vehicle Heidi
[34:46] trades field look really nice and this
[34:50] person gets out she or he I'm not too
[34:54] sure and a nice long dressed and like
[34:57] anything normal nice woman's dress and a
[35:00] beard down here and it was scary
[35:03] all the jewelry but that's that he's
[35:07] less ridiculed them we are that's just
[35:09] normal to this world what's gone wrong
[35:12] something's gone wrong but the way
[35:19] people treat you today is their approach
[35:21] to God even if they can't see this
[35:22] message it can be an approach to God for
[35:25] those people we should make ourselves
[35:26] approachable and we'll be stuck up you
[35:28] know but rain you drown they just don't
[35:35] realize they're an oddball you know I'm
[35:37] not old-fashioned my wife's not
[35:39] old-fashioned she's just the original
[35:40] and then I like the original see because
[35:43] all this hybrids see that we've got
[35:45] today you've only got a look you've only
[35:47] got to look at nature and that hybrids
[35:48] see that can't stand it can't when the
[35:50] storms of life come when the doctor says
[35:52] you've got cancer and you've got three
[35:53] months to live
[35:54] hybrid sea goes but the real weight goes
[35:58] Lord I need you and then the original
[36:03] seed but the more time goes on since
[36:07] brother Branham left the scene the more
[36:09] people criticize I want to come to this
[36:12] because this is something quite
[36:15] important because even ourselves we can
[36:17] begin to doubt as time more time goes on
[36:20] and more time goes on but time can only
[36:23] go so much because times already been
[36:24] pronounced that's got an end
[36:27] when judgment is about to strike this
[36:29] earth you know when brother Brennan was
[36:34] up in sunset man and he said judgments
[36:36] about to strike the west coast and a
[36:39] couple of days later Alaska nearly sunk
[36:41] and the prophets prophecy was fulfilled
[36:43] right then and there but then he also
[36:46] prophesy that California would go down
[36:49] and fall into the bottom of the sea and
[36:51] he talked about Russia and I elating
[36:53] America with nukes you know all these
[36:56] different prophecies and they haven't
[36:57] come to pass you so what is he a false
[37:00] prophet because he said thousands of
[37:03] things that did come to pass but the
[37:05] more time goes on the more people start
[37:07] to doubt the Prophet but he's already
[37:12] been vindicated God doesn't call a man
[37:18] to judgment without first warning him
[37:21] all right we find out the first he sends
[37:25] his prophets with a warning he doesn't
[37:27] change his way his method of doing
[37:29] things he does not always strike when he
[37:33] warns I want you to watch this quotation
[37:36] God gives a warning but he don't always
[37:39] strike at the same time he warns that
[37:41] you notice that and then when he does
[37:44] not doesn't strike when he sends a
[37:46] warning then the Prophet is mocked you
[37:49] didn't have it you told a lie he wasn't
[37:51] right you know I think we could glean
[37:54] something from that's just some we could
[37:57] clean some advice from Noah's day
[37:59] because as he stood out there on the
[38:03] edge of us are maybe while he was
[38:04] building it he was say judgments coming
[38:07] judgments coming because he recognized
[38:09] something and people would you know that
[38:12] just was just an old man just labeling
[38:15] off again he's saying it's gonna rain
[38:16] the skies are going to open up and God
[38:20] is going to destroy this earth but you
[38:24] know I bet as much as people didn't
[38:27] believe him and they thought he was
[38:28] crazy I bet people would go up there
[38:31] every now and again just because they
[38:32] were intrigued by him because he had a
[38:34] life that he loved and he was no evil so
[38:37] they were intrigued so they would go up
[38:39] there album and then
[38:41] go back down now Jesus crazy I go back
[38:43] up and I wonder if it can be like that
[38:45] for us sometimes because we know that
[38:47] either we're at the Earth's and judgment
[38:49] God's going to destroy the world and
[38:50] then you start living back in the
[38:52] pleasures of the earth again oh I know
[38:54] the Lord's going to destroy the earth so
[38:56] you start to go back up to the ark again
[38:58] and you wind up this wishy-washy
[38:59] Christian but there was someone else
[39:04] that recognized the hour of that day the
[39:07] evilness and he wasn't fussed about
[39:09] going in and out he just walked before
[39:11] God and Enoch when in a rapture and we
[39:14] could be like that just recognizing the
[39:16] hour of the day and the people in Noah's
[39:20] day that would have still been
[39:21] worshiping right it might have been
[39:23] idolatry worship evil worship but they
[39:25] were still worshipping God but it wasn't
[39:28] the way that God wanted to be worship
[39:29] they weren't worshipping right we've got
[39:33] to make sure our worship is right we
[39:36] should we should actively seek that we
[39:39] worship God the right way and the
[39:44] indictment he says today men walk
[39:48] ignorant Lee they don't know that that's
[39:51] the truth they think it's some kind of
[39:53] ism they don't dig down deep enough and
[39:56] to get into the spirit of Revelation
[39:59] they don't pray enough they don't call
[40:02] upon God enough they just take it
[40:05] lightly oh well I believe there's a god
[40:08] sure the devil believes the same thing
[40:10] the devil believes that more than some
[40:13] people claim to believe it is that right
[40:17] the devil believes that entrance people
[40:21] just believe it and go on but the devil
[40:24] trembles knowing as judgment is coming
[40:26] and the people believe it and don't pay
[40:29] no attention that the judgment is coming
[40:31] that's what that's my burden I can see
[40:35] that judgment is coming upon this earth
[40:37] what are you going to do about it
[40:39] how serious are you that you do not want
[40:42] to be in that judgment because there has
[40:45] to be an action it has to be a
[40:47] preparation the devil knows as Times
[40:52] drawing to a close he knows us as
[40:54] endures near it's gonna be destroyed you
[40:59] know he has seen it happen before
[41:00] remember this we haven't seen that
[41:02] happen before but he has seen that
[41:03] happen before so when these signs start
[41:06] appearing he's going my time's running
[41:08] out because I've seen it happen before
[41:12] and I want to show this and take a look
[41:15] at Moses on his mountain getting his
[41:17] commission to bring the people out and
[41:19] into the Promised Land so I'm going to
[41:22] go to Exodus Exodus 3 verse 6 moreover
[41:29] he said I am the God of thy father the
[41:33] God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the
[41:36] God of Jacob and Moses had his face for
[41:39] he was afraid to look upon God
[41:41] I remember brother Brennan saying a
[41:43] similar statement to that too that he
[41:45] was afraid to look upon Jesus and the
[41:48] Lord said surely I have seen the
[41:51] affliction of my people which are in
[41:52] Egypt and they have heard their cry and
[41:56] and have heard their cry by reason of
[41:58] their taskmasters for I know their
[42:01] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[42:05] them out of the hand of the Egyptians
[42:06] and to bring them up into a land and to
[42:10] a good land and a large unto a land
[42:12] flowing with milk and honey and to the
[42:14] place of the Canaanites the Hutterites
[42:16] the emirates the PISA writes the Hivites
[42:18] and the Jebusites so in first eight
[42:21] there he says I am come down where was
[42:25] he that was Moses I am come down to
[42:28] deliver my people that was work God
[42:31] working through Moses to see it as
[42:34] people free and brother branham showed
[42:36] Moses was a perfect type of Christ and
[42:38] when God moved through the spirit he
[42:41] moved Moses to bring his people out of
[42:43] judgment so the devil seen this happened
[42:46] before God coming down into a man to
[42:48] bring a people out of bondage but you
[42:52] can come so close to meeting God you
[42:55] know you can come through the outer
[42:56] court and come into the inner room but
[43:00] then you've got to go right through
[43:01] there and go beyond the veil some people
[43:04] only come and enter there to their
[43:06] second stage of grace
[43:08] right they don't come whole way in and
[43:11] meet God because without coming through
[43:14] there in a veil in meeting God you're
[43:15] not going in a rapture and why does
[43:17] rather say it the way it is you have to
[43:19] meet God in there in a place because in
[43:22] that in a place is where the Mercy
[43:24] Cedars and without making your way to
[43:26] that mercy see there ain't no rapture
[43:28] for you so you need to make sure you get
[43:31] yourself into that secret place of
[43:33] Christ and when you do how insignificant
[43:39] are the things of this world going to
[43:41] see how insignificance is YouTube's
[43:44] going to seem when you come into that
[43:46] place how insignificant is a sporting
[43:50] event gonna seem oh I don't know
[43:52] whatever your your flesh lusts to know
[43:56] how insignificant will that feel when
[43:58] the fires falling amen
[44:01] if we could only recognize Jesus Christ
[44:05] and Moses if we could recognize that we
[44:09] could recognize what God's doing today
[44:13] amen
[44:15] he's bringing you people out of Egypt
[44:17] and it's God himself doing it he's just
[44:21] working through a man and the indictment
[44:25] and today there's not a reader that
[44:27] cannot read acts 2:38 the same as I can
[44:30] read it and the rest of it just the same
[44:33] as I can read it but because of their
[44:35] Creed's and because of the
[44:36] denominational tickets they've got in
[44:38] their pocket the marks of the Beast they
[44:40] packing around his fellowship cards and
[44:43] taking those things they crucify to
[44:45] themselves Jesus Christ afresh and
[44:48] crucify him before the public and
[44:50] blaspheme the very God that promised to
[44:53] do this bringing damnation upon the race
[44:57] now there they not the sinner they that
[45:03] is the Church of that day they found
[45:06] fault with the man who was the word
[45:08] that's right they found fault with the
[45:10] man who was the word now they find fault
[45:15] with the word working through man see
[45:18] they just vice versa root which is the
[45:20] person
[45:22] the Holy Spirit working through as God's
[45:25] vindication so they found fault with
[45:27] Jesus Christ how much more do they find
[45:29] fault today and yet they crucified Jesus
[45:31] Christ afresh today
[45:34] no wonder God's going to destroy this
[45:36] terrible racist in a terrible generation
[45:39] they found fault with Moses and you the
[45:43] whole only holy one Moses said no other
[45:46] holy man in the land has there no other
[45:48] prophet there were plenty of ministries
[45:51] and brother branham's day they were
[45:53] plenty of more popular ministries and
[45:55] brother Brennan but there was one that
[45:58] had the provided way
[46:02] and now because I've rejected in this
[46:05] world is trembling as in judgment but
[46:08] just because it was a nice day today
[46:09] just because the Sun was shining just
[46:12] because the money was coming in and
[46:14] everyone had work and there was no
[46:16] tribulation oh well maybe God's not
[46:20] going to destroy the earth like tomorrow
[46:22] maybe it's like 10 years away what if
[46:27] it's not what if it's not whatever it's
[46:32] tomorrow
[46:33] the indictment I must show and will show
[46:37] that the same spirit is on the people
[46:40] today that brought the first crucifixion
[46:42] and doing the same thing I must do that
[46:46] if it's going to be a crucifixion that
[46:48] they've crucified I must show to the to
[46:51] the people that the same attitude and
[46:54] the people today is doing the same thing
[46:56] spiritually that they did physically
[46:59] then and God is spirit so if they're
[47:03] doing the same thing spiritually today
[47:05] that they did physically then and it's
[47:07] the same thing that they're doing today
[47:09] they crucified physically Jesus Christ
[47:12] the Son of God and now today by the same
[47:16] word and by the same Holy Spirit the
[47:18] same word I wish to show the churches
[47:20] they're there where they stand that
[47:23] they're doing the same thing today and
[47:25] the Bible said that they would do it and
[47:27] prove that this is the day that we're
[47:30] living in now I just this is really how
[47:34] awful statement that he makes here it
[47:37] could not have been done a few years ago
[47:39] I say 50 years ago
[47:41] it could not have been done he wasn't
[47:43] crucified for in 1909 wasn't crucified
[47:47] in 1920 but today it is very timely and
[47:52] it could not have been done maybe 10
[47:55] years ago but it can be done today
[47:57] because the poems run out something's
[48:00] happened something's happened
[48:02] there's no longer time for ignorant well
[48:07] maybe it was a prophet maybe he wasn't
[48:08] well I'll just be a good Christian
[48:10] there's no time for that
[48:11] God has provided a way and it's the only
[48:14] way just look at the message title the
[48:16] only provided way there was only one way
[48:18] out of Egypt we are at the end time and
[48:25] I believe as a servant that we are that
[48:27] we are we're just about to cross from
[48:30] this land to another oh boy I can't wait
[48:33] to cross cross I feel like I'm crossing
[48:37] now this flesh you know therefore the
[48:41] time for repentance for a nation has
[48:43] gone I believe that this nation cannot
[48:46] repent I believe that it's crossed the
[48:49] line between mercy and judgment I
[48:51] believe she is toddling in the balance
[48:54] brother Brandon before you start your
[48:56] case how are you going to prove that
[48:58] that's a pretty bold statement to make
[49:01] that she's pastor she's done how are you
[49:05] going to prove this just this that we
[49:08] are guilty for the same sense that God
[49:10] destroyed the world by and the
[49:12] antelopian world we're guilty of the
[49:14] same sins that he destroyed the world
[49:16] and Sodom and Gomorrah and now we got
[49:19] all the same spiritual evidence laying
[49:22] here before us all the same spiritual
[49:25] evidence worldwide known that brought
[49:27] down the mercies of God upon those
[49:29] generations that also to reject have
[49:33] bought judgment so the same thing that
[49:36] brought down mercy to those people that
[49:38] brought down a way of escape at the same
[49:41] time brought down judgment so of his
[49:43] provided a way out he's also bringing a
[49:46] judgment
[49:47] and to not go out you're left with the
[49:49] judgment so at this generation has
[49:52] rejected the same mercy that was spooned
[49:54] and M days God would be unjust to let
[49:57] them get by without judgment so brother
[50:02] Brennan sometimes I know this church is
[50:06] well taught but sometimes people can
[50:09] mess the whole picture of his ministry
[50:12] so as he stood there and choosing of a
[50:15] bride and he was preaching that God's
[50:17] come to take a bride but he wasn't just
[50:20] showing that God's come to take a bride
[50:23] because he takes us to scriptures at the
[50:25] start and he places himself and Genesis
[50:28] with the Eleazar call right to call a
[50:31] bride for Isaac and then he's still
[50:33] talking about the bride and he goes to
[50:35] Revelation was a 21 verse 9 and he
[50:40] places himself here as come hither and I
[50:45] will show thee the let the bride the
[50:46] Lambs wife but that's not the whole part
[50:49] of the scripture because he's also
[50:50] placing himself there and there came
[50:53] unto me one of the seven angels which
[50:55] had the seven vials full of the seven
[50:58] last plagues and that was associated
[51:00] with his ministry because at the same
[51:02] time God sent someone to come and bring
[51:05] the people out he also brought the
[51:08] judgments with him so we can't miss that
[51:11] part of his ministry so God is going to
[51:18] provide an escape for us we know that
[51:20] but we should we should be so happy
[51:22] about that we shouldn't just be so well
[51:25] you know I know that I knew that teen I
[51:27] knew that before I even knew the message
[51:28] God was going to provide a rapture for
[51:30] me yeah but what are you doing about it
[51:32] are you happy about it are you rejoicing
[51:35] about it not one soul be left behind as
[51:39] my prayer just as when the Death Angel
[51:44] was going to sweep over Egypt but had
[51:46] come to a point where the plagues and
[51:49] that land had boiled up to their last
[51:50] plague which was death death you know
[51:56] it's no good to just know that Jesus
[51:59] died to save you today
[52:00] you've actually got to take his blood
[52:02] and apply it to your life because
[52:04] without actually you know it's saying
[52:06] yet Jesus died for me Jesus died as this
[52:08] millions of people in the world today
[52:10] that said Jesus died for me but I don't
[52:12] love you any different than someone that
[52:14] Jesus didn't die for
[52:16] well that doesn't realize it but
[52:17] something's different about us because
[52:19] we take that life that Christ spelled
[52:22] out and he's sent it back to us and now
[52:24] we pick that same life back up and
[52:27] display it and if we don't then we
[52:31] haven't accepted what he sent for us so
[52:36] I started thinking about brother Branham
[52:41] when he was on sunset mountain and that
[52:43] sword come down and struck his hand and
[52:47] I'll just I've just read this quote
[52:51] because I don't want to jump ahead of
[52:53] myself well the Lord was vindicating
[52:55] that the word had come to the hand of
[52:57] his prophet but when I started to search
[53:00] through the Bible at this sort the sword
[53:02] had more than one purpose more than just
[53:04] the purpose of opening of the word
[53:08] what's the attraction on the mountain he
[53:11] said I went up in the canyon climb plumb
[53:14] up where the Eagles was flying around
[53:16] that sounds like a pretty good place for
[53:18] a prophet to go and I was watching some
[53:21] deer standing there I now down to pray
[53:23] and raised up my hands and a sword
[53:25] struck my hand I looked around I thought
[53:27] what's that I'm not beside myself here
[53:30] is that sword in my hand bright shiny
[53:32] glistening in the Sun I said now there's
[53:36] not people and miles of me way up here
[53:38] in this canyon where could that come
[53:40] from I heard a voice say that's the
[53:43] Kings sword I see it a king knights a
[53:46] man with a sword he the voice come back
[53:49] said not a king saud but the king saw
[53:53] the word of the Lord said fear not it's
[53:57] only thy third Pole
[53:59] it's the vindication of your ministry so
[54:01] now the sword has tied to the third Pole
[54:04] so this is the third pole of your
[54:07] ministry okay so now we've got a bit of
[54:11] more of an idea of what the Saudis
[54:12] because we can go back and we can say
[54:14] well what
[54:14] attached to the third pole because there
[54:17] were three great things attached to that
[54:19] and that was the opening of the word the
[54:22] opening of the seals right that was
[54:23] attached to the third pole the other
[54:25] thing happened before the seals but that
[54:28] was the spoken word and that was
[54:30] attached that was one of the great three
[54:32] things attached the third pole and the
[54:35] third thing was preaching to the Lost
[54:37] Souls
[54:37] so there are three things now attached
[54:40] to this and preaching to the lost souls
[54:42] as preaching to those ones that were
[54:44] judged and he continues on this quote
[54:48] and this is where it come back to win
[54:49] that minister was blaspheming the angel
[54:53] of the Lord and this just struck me he's
[54:56] just been gone up there and being given
[54:58] the sword which just put a change in his
[55:01] ministry that just brought down a line
[55:03] where something was going to now change
[55:05] something one of the most major events
[55:08] and the history of the Bible had just
[55:10] taken place and now he comes down off
[55:13] the mountain and carries on here I was
[55:16] going hunting with a friend not knowing
[55:18] what was going to happen and someone
[55:19] called me the one that criticized me
[55:22] about the picture of angel of the Lord
[55:24] that one that took it I had to go to
[55:27] Houston about a son for he was going and
[55:29] death row and was going to be killed in
[55:32] a few days so now this man has that
[55:36] blaspheme their angel of the Lord and
[55:39] you can't always do that and now the
[55:42] death had come on a son I would pick to
[55:45] presume maybe it was his firstborn
[55:47] because and when Moses plagues that the
[55:50] plague was not for the father the plague
[55:53] was for a son for all for his firstborn
[55:55] that's what the play come on and now
[55:57] this plagues come on his son
[56:00] and he met me and threw his arms around
[56:04] me so you'd think the very man that I
[56:07] criticized comes to save my only son and
[56:10] at the end of the story brother Brandon
[56:12] managed to get that boy off death row
[56:14] but that boy still had to serve a life
[56:17] prison sentence and I think today the
[56:20] way we conduct ourselves when someone's
[56:22] fully rejected this message blaspheme
[56:25] that walked away from it yet we can
[56:27] still be approachable
[56:28] because who was the first person they
[56:30] come to when they come into a crisis in
[56:33] their life and yet we can't pray them
[56:36] back into the father to the Lamb's Book
[56:38] of Life
[56:38] but our prayers can be so powerful that
[56:41] maybe we can just reach out and make
[56:43] that that walk for them a little bit
[56:44] easier we should never get to the point
[56:47] where someone we just push someone I'm
[56:49] done with that brother done with him
[56:52] he's blaspheming the Holy Ghost is we've
[56:54] been through a generation that have done
[56:56] that and push people away push churches
[56:58] away lord have mercy on us we can take a
[57:02] lesson out of that amen the sword that
[57:08] come into the hand of brother Branham I
[57:10] believe it's the same sword that was in
[57:12] Joshua's hand as the same sword that was
[57:14] in Daniels hand the same sword that was
[57:17] in all the prophets that carried and
[57:20] went forth the word that was in their
[57:23] hand the weapon that was in their hand I
[57:25] believe that that weapon even became a
[57:28] jawbone because it was the word of the
[57:30] Lord going forth to slay to deliver the
[57:37] same time that seventh angels message is
[57:40] coming to bring forth the hidden
[57:41] mysteries of the book is coming forth a
[57:43] judgment Martin Luther couldn't bring an
[57:46] indictment
[57:46] John Weasley couldn't bring an
[57:48] indictment but the seventh angel
[57:50] messenger could bring an indictment
[57:57] still in the indictment I've got it
[58:00] right to indict this generation I've got
[58:02] a right to do it as a minister of the
[58:04] gospel of Jesus Christ with signs and
[58:06] proving that he is God I've got a right
[58:09] to bring an indictment against this
[58:11] generation because as hard as
[58:13] spearpoints has been right from the
[58:14] pulpits where they have criticized and
[58:17] says don't go out and hear that stuff
[58:19] that's of the devil right and the place
[58:21] that's supposed to love them and the
[58:23] very signs that jesus said would take
[58:25] place the Word of God is sharper than a
[58:28] two-edged sword a word the word at a
[58:31] cerner of the thoughts and intents of
[58:33] the heart has called the devil we're
[58:35] from the pulpit we're from the pulpit
[58:38] and this but I don't even want to go
[58:41] there
[58:41] we have to be so careful we have to be
[58:44] so careful how we handle this so careful
[58:49] how you handle this with your family
[58:50] don't misinterpret it it's already been
[58:53] interpreted and then he carries on here
[59:01] Oh God how can he look down just mercy
[59:03] that's all grace we can't do nothing
[59:06] else but heed for judgment we're already
[59:09] there uh-huh
[59:10] we're already there and yet we can just
[59:13] say well it was a beautiful day today
[59:14] there were beautiful ladies walking down
[59:17] the road beautiful men walking down the
[59:20] road of you're a woman that was
[59:22] wonderful and don't realize that we're
[59:25] under judgment
[59:29] we can't play Church that the days of
[59:33] playing church are gone man has sowed
[59:37] and now he has to reap that's just the
[59:40] law of God and I believe that that the
[59:43] Lord is doing something now and I
[59:46] believe he's starting to warm people
[59:47] he's actually I believe he's starting to
[59:50] raise gifts in the church that will that
[59:52] will alert us and make us aware that
[59:55] this is this is happening now this is
[59:57] coming upon us now as we start to see
[1:00:05] all these plagues and things that are
[1:00:06] coming out that's actually bringing the
[1:00:08] squeeze on the church now and the
[1:00:10] squeeze is going to bring the best out
[1:00:12] of the bride say you take a lemon and
[1:00:15] you want to squeeze that lemon and as
[1:00:19] you squeeze that lemon all the life of
[1:00:21] that lemon comes out on the juice and
[1:00:23] that's for all the goodness as that's
[1:00:25] the part of the lemon I want then what's
[1:00:27] left all the flesh just the flesh so
[1:00:30] what's the squeeze going to do as it
[1:00:32] comes on it's going to squeeze the life
[1:00:34] out of us and it's going to leave behind
[1:00:36] all the flesh and that's what we want I
[1:00:45] took the scripture last time that I I
[1:00:48] just felt I wanted to show something and
[1:00:51] I want to go back through it again and
[1:00:52] just come down to
[1:00:55] here at cq9 and he cried also in mine
[1:00:59] ears with a loud voice saying cause then
[1:01:01] that have charged over the city to draw
[1:01:04] near every man with his destroying
[1:01:06] weapon in his hand and behold six men
[1:01:09] came from the way of the higher gate
[1:01:10] which life toward the north every man
[1:01:13] with a slaughter weapon in his hand and
[1:01:15] one man among them clothed with linen
[1:01:18] were the riders and corn by a side and
[1:01:20] they went in and stood before the brazen
[1:01:22] older this is part tied with the
[1:01:25] judgment that's coming on the earth now
[1:01:26] and the glory of God of Israel was gone
[1:01:29] up from the cherub whereupon he was to
[1:01:32] the threshold of the house and called to
[1:01:34] the man clothed of linen which is which
[1:01:36] had the riders in corn by his side and
[1:01:40] the Lord said unto him go through the
[1:01:43] midst of the city through the midst of
[1:01:45] Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[1:01:47] foreheads of the men that sigh and cry
[1:01:49] for the abominations that be done and
[1:01:52] and that's there off that should be our
[1:01:54] attitude right now that we saw and cry
[1:01:56] not just take pleasure in it but that we
[1:01:58] actually are ups genuinely upset by the
[1:02:02] Sun that's out there it should affect
[1:02:04] you it shouldn't just pass you by when
[1:02:08] you see a TV come on right and you're
[1:02:10] out on the mall and there's a TV playing
[1:02:12] you should be upset with what's been
[1:02:15] broadcasted through the airwaves because
[1:02:17] all that is is how pouring through that
[1:02:19] dimension enter your dimension where
[1:02:22] your senses can pick it up it should
[1:02:24] upset you not that you're angry at the
[1:02:27] people but that you at your you're upset
[1:02:29] you you just don't want to live in this
[1:02:32] wicked place anymore because there's a
[1:02:34] longing in your heart for a better place
[1:02:36] and to the others he said in mine
[1:02:39] hearing go ye after him through the city
[1:02:41] and smite let not your eyes spare
[1:02:44] neither have you pity slay utterly old
[1:02:47] young both maids and little children and
[1:02:50] woman but come not near any man upon
[1:02:53] whom the matter
[1:02:54] as the mark and begin at my sanctuary
[1:02:57] they begin at the ancient men which were
[1:02:59] before the house now this actually
[1:03:02] happened right this actually happened in
[1:03:04] Jerusalem after when the exile happened
[1:03:07] and Titus came in and
[1:03:08] all those Jews was and they slew young
[1:03:10] old everyone brother branham's did that
[1:03:13] happen that was then that was the
[1:03:14] scripture being fulfilled and he said
[1:03:16] that looks exactly what's on the church
[1:03:18] now that same thing is now fulfilling
[1:03:21] again at the seeking crucifixion
[1:03:23] listening to the Feast of Trumpets today
[1:03:25] and him just hammering down that line
[1:03:27] and it's scary this this thing's coming
[1:03:30] upon the earth that is scary I just
[1:03:33] started to think it's no wonder he
[1:03:34] wouldn't preach that the Feast of the
[1:03:36] trumpets the way he wanted to because
[1:03:39] the things that are going to happen
[1:03:40] after the bride goes after there's no
[1:03:44] serpent held up on the pole when the
[1:03:45] snake bites these things that are going
[1:03:48] to happen that would shock the people if
[1:03:50] they knew and it's all in Scripture
[1:03:52] that's all an open view but begin at my
[1:03:57] sanctuary
[1:03:58] because when the squeeze really comes on
[1:04:01] the squeeze is not coming for the
[1:04:03] nightclub down the road that's it's
[1:04:06] going to begin at the sanctuary evening
[1:04:08] and that's where I want to just show
[1:04:10] this coming out he's warning us to get
[1:04:14] ready
[1:04:15] once the bride leaves and this blood
[1:04:17] comes off you I tell you when we say all
[1:04:20] hell is going to break loose
[1:04:21] well that doesn't even justify the
[1:04:24] saying it's really going to be a
[1:04:26] horrible thing so I've been studying
[1:04:28] Zedekiah after I finished my message I
[1:04:32] still had ten pages of just Scripture
[1:04:35] mostly Jeremiah because there's just so
[1:04:38] much written in the scripture and shadow
[1:04:40] of what's about to happen
[1:04:41] now as this judgment comes on the earth
[1:04:44] and I just want to bring something out
[1:04:46] on a go to Chronicles 436 verse 11
[1:04:52] Zedekiah was one and twenty years old
[1:04:55] when he began to reign and reigned
[1:04:57] eleven years in Jerusalem and did that
[1:05:00] which was evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:05:02] and God and humbled not himself before
[1:05:05] Jeremiah the Prophet and speaking from
[1:05:07] the mouth of the Lord and he also
[1:05:10] rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar who
[1:05:13] made him swear by God but he stiffened
[1:05:16] his neck and hardened his heart from
[1:05:17] turning to the Lord God of Israel now as
[1:05:20] I read through this I
[1:05:22] and I've been studying this I start to
[1:05:23] see this the denominational spirit the
[1:05:26] Protestant spirit and this King Zedekiah
[1:05:28] and Rome coming against them and I'm not
[1:05:31] obeying the prophets as the prophets are
[1:05:33] coming in he's rebelling both against
[1:05:35] the prophets but still also rebelling
[1:05:39] against the Catholic system against
[1:05:42] Babylon moreover all the chiefs of the
[1:05:45] priests and the people transgress very
[1:05:47] much after all the abominations of the
[1:05:50] heathen and polluted the house of the
[1:05:52] Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem
[1:05:54] and the Lord God of their father sent to
[1:05:58] him then by his messengers rising up the
[1:06:01] times and sending because he had
[1:06:03] compassion on his people and on his
[1:06:05] dwelling place but they mocked the
[1:06:10] messengers of God and despised his words
[1:06:12] and misuses prophets until the wrath of
[1:06:17] the Lord arose against his people till
[1:06:19] there was no remedy till there was no
[1:06:22] remedy and we're coming into that time
[1:06:25] now when the bride leaves there is no
[1:06:28] remedy there's no remedy if you're not
[1:06:31] saved when the bride leaves that's it
[1:06:33] there's no remedy
[1:06:37] therefore he brought upon them the king
[1:06:40] of the Chaldees who slew the young men
[1:06:42] with the sword and the house of the
[1:06:44] sanctuary and they had no compassion
[1:06:47] upon young men or maiden or old men or
[1:06:50] him who stooped for age he gave them all
[1:06:53] into his hand just another thing backing
[1:06:55] up the same thing that once the bride
[1:06:58] leaves and this persecution is going to
[1:06:59] head straight for the Protestant church
[1:07:01] and it doesn't matter that they don't
[1:07:05] care if you're young I don't care if
[1:07:06] you're old I don't care who you are man
[1:07:09] or woman that persecution is going to be
[1:07:11] ruthless you just look at what's
[1:07:13] happened through the years that's going
[1:07:15] to be the same thing happen again and
[1:07:18] all the vessels of the house of God
[1:07:21] great and small the treasures of the
[1:07:23] house of the Lord all the treasures of
[1:07:25] the king and his Prince's all these he
[1:07:27] brought to Babylon so everything that
[1:07:30] they had built up all the wealth of
[1:07:31] their church that's all taken where to
[1:07:33] Rome
[1:07:35] all confiscated and you know what you
[1:07:38] know what this cans greatest for was it
[1:07:40] was pride
[1:07:41] yeah and pride will destroy anyone any
[1:07:45] ministry and if you actually look what
[1:07:49] this King did he actually invited King
[1:07:53] Nebuchadnezzar into his house said look
[1:07:55] look what I've look at this Kingdom I've
[1:07:58] created come into my house and take a
[1:08:00] look look at all the vessels look at
[1:08:03] everything that I've got and through
[1:08:05] that he opened himself up to the enemy
[1:08:08] and the enemy said is pretty nice pretty
[1:08:11] nice you know what I'm going to take all
[1:08:13] of that through his own pride he
[1:08:15] destroyed himself it's not that he
[1:08:20] doesn't have a chance to repent he was
[1:08:22] given that prophets were sent to him but
[1:08:24] he rejected them future home of the
[1:08:30] heavenly bride the same glorious son of
[1:08:34] God manifested himself in human flesh
[1:08:36] here on the earth
[1:08:37] making the promised love exactly blinded
[1:08:40] to the eyes of the Pharisees and
[1:08:41] Sadducees Herodians and so forth and
[1:08:44] today it repeats again the word been
[1:08:47] manifested just like it was the word
[1:08:50] knowing the secret of the heart just
[1:08:52] exactly the way it was as the scripture
[1:08:55] said which cannot be broken
[1:08:57] help us God to realize it help us to
[1:09:01] realize it I pray that I pray lord help
[1:09:04] us to realize it help these now who
[1:09:07] raised their hands may they buckle up
[1:09:10] there
[1:09:10] buckle up a little tighter showed
[1:09:13] themselves for the gospel of peace put
[1:09:15] on the full armor of God
[1:09:17] pull the helmet down take the shield of
[1:09:20] faith march forward from today on
[1:09:22] granted Lord just a little while we'll
[1:09:26] be summoned then the rapture will come
[1:09:28] just a little bitty group like Enoch
[1:09:31] will be taken up then the remnant of the
[1:09:34] woman's seed that keep the commandments
[1:09:36] of God Jews had the testimony of Jesus
[1:09:40] Christ Gentile will be hunted down like
[1:09:43] dogs and shall give their life for their
[1:09:45] testimony that's what's going to take
[1:09:48] place when the bride goes
[1:09:49] hunted down like dogs horrible place to
[1:09:52] be left behind and look at what we have
[1:09:55] now with all this AI because every
[1:09:59] you're actually being profiled you know
[1:10:01] that it's rather creepy and we sort of
[1:10:04] just accept that I have myself it's like
[1:10:08] well they're watching me I know it but
[1:10:10] I'm gonna go in a rapture so I really
[1:10:11] don't get but what if you're not going
[1:10:13] to go in a rapture they're going to have
[1:10:15] a big profile of who you are you know
[1:10:18] what you follow a cult according to the
[1:10:20] AI they've profiled you completely and
[1:10:25] it's just like we were in know lemmings
[1:10:27] other day and I had not even thought
[1:10:30] about a Microsoft Surface pro and a long
[1:10:33] time and the Dean goes to me oh look at
[1:10:36] this one it's a surface book and I see
[1:10:38] it come over there I said no that's a
[1:10:40] surface lat book three next morning what
[1:10:43] pops up on my Google feed advertisement
[1:10:45] would you like to buy the next Google or
[1:10:48] Microsoft Surface book three how did it
[1:10:51] know that I wanted to was interested in
[1:10:53] that yeah your microphones even
[1:10:55] listening to you in your phone this is
[1:10:58] this is what the devil is doing so when
[1:11:01] you get left behind no one gets left
[1:11:04] behind right but I'm just saying if you
[1:11:07] are what's going to happen it's not like
[1:11:10] you're just going to go hide in a cave
[1:11:11] somewhere because they're going to know
[1:11:15] exactly who you are what you're into
[1:11:17] what you believed you followed a false
[1:11:19] prophet as far as they're concerned
[1:11:21] right lord have mercy lord have mercy
[1:11:28] but as the squeeze is coming on because
[1:11:31] it's coming on now God's going to
[1:11:33] display power because he said you wait
[1:11:37] till the squeeze comes on then you watch
[1:11:39] the third pole come into action because
[1:11:41] that spoken word is going to come out
[1:11:43] when they say you know what maybe it'll
[1:11:46] happen for a month or so I don't know I
[1:11:48] really don't know but I'm picking it's
[1:11:50] not going to be for a long time when
[1:11:52] that real power is going to come forth
[1:11:54] and I say you know what you can't buy
[1:11:56] nothing you know they're trying to make
[1:11:58] New Zealand the first cashless society
[1:12:00] because they don't want to experiment
[1:12:03] so well actually we need to know where
[1:12:05] you stand we need to know where your
[1:12:07] values are we your morals are can you
[1:12:09] recognize with us no I can't recognize
[1:12:11] with them I bet your alleged CI but
[1:12:13] that's a cult sorry we can't give you a
[1:12:15] cat I'm just I'm not prophesying I'm
[1:12:17] just saying and what's going to happen
[1:12:20] in the brother branham said that the
[1:12:23] bride will do the greater things and he
[1:12:25] preached you know through his ministry
[1:12:27] they get they'll do more more the
[1:12:28] correct meanings more but then at the
[1:12:30] end he says no they're going to do the
[1:12:32] greater things because where Jesus took
[1:12:34] a fish and broke it and made more fish
[1:12:37] but the bride's going to have nothing
[1:12:39] and brother Andy's going to say Lord I
[1:12:42] want a bigger eiffel at stake and it's
[1:12:44] just going to appear and we're gonna eat
[1:12:46] real good for one month and it ain't
[1:12:48] gonna cost nothing but you know what
[1:12:54] look at the plagues that are starting to
[1:12:56] come now look at this coronavirus you
[1:13:00] know there's coronavirus and don't think
[1:13:02] for a minute that it's just some random
[1:13:03] thing that come off a bet because this
[1:13:05] has been engineered to bring on the
[1:13:08] rapture so it's been engineered because
[1:13:10] china is starting to get too high and
[1:13:12] mighty this has been engineered even
[1:13:15] someone just not a Christian was telling
[1:13:18] me today how this plague was engineered
[1:13:19] as a weapon a war and now they're saying
[1:13:22] that they've missed 50% of the cases
[1:13:25] have gone through unrecognized because
[1:13:27] they thought it had a 14-day incubation
[1:13:29] period and now they realize it's got a
[1:13:32] 30-day incubation period that's all the
[1:13:34] people they've been letting go out of
[1:13:36] the facilities that haven't got sick
[1:13:38] they've retested 30 days later and
[1:13:40] they're carrying it and the other thing
[1:13:42] I've just read today about it as they
[1:13:45] actually realizing that this bug has
[1:13:47] formed so that has carriers they don't
[1:13:50] get sick so now people don't get sick
[1:13:53] from it they travel out of Europe
[1:13:55] they're carrying the virus someone else
[1:13:57] gets that they get sick and there's no
[1:13:59] way that they can detect that bug who
[1:14:02] engineered that this is the hour we're
[1:14:06] living and honestly from what I've been
[1:14:09] looking at on these plagues there is
[1:14:10] nothing that has nothing on what's
[1:14:13] coming absolutely nothing
[1:14:16] look at this and who is God groans our
[1:14:20] Lord that something will be said tonight
[1:14:22] or done that will cause the wayward to
[1:14:25] turn to Christ for we believe and feel
[1:14:28] pressed in the spirit that great
[1:14:30] judgments are upon these lands in the
[1:14:32] last days plagues diseases germs already
[1:14:36] bred up to be scattered throughout the
[1:14:38] nations he's prophesying here that these
[1:14:40] things have been bred up they're not
[1:14:42] just a natural occurring thing these
[1:14:44] things have been bred up as weapons of
[1:14:46] war no doctor know even how to take hold
[1:14:50] of it Oh God we'll have to believe in
[1:14:52] divine healing then when nations are
[1:14:54] breeding germs together to burst them
[1:14:56] and bombs and millions die in hours of
[1:14:58] it but I was so thankful hallelujah when
[1:15:02] the destroying angel went forth you said
[1:15:04] touch none that has the seal of the
[1:15:07] Father upon their forehead they are mine
[1:15:09] oh we're so glad tonight to be under the
[1:15:13] blood safely protected amen
[1:15:16] there's a place tonight where you can be
[1:15:18] safely predicted as you see all these
[1:15:21] signs coming on this great judgment come
[1:15:23] on there is a place that you can be
[1:15:25] safely protected where you do not have
[1:15:27] to be partakers of those plagues that
[1:15:29] are coming maybe the musicians can come
[1:15:35] up and when they come to an end but I'm
[1:15:39] afraid I'm afraid that sometimes we
[1:15:42] don't apply apply our faith we don't
[1:15:47] apply our Christian life the way that we
[1:15:49] should we just we just become too
[1:15:51] relaxed about it it's just another day
[1:15:53] I've got to go to work today to earn
[1:15:55] more money to pay for tomorrow and that
[1:15:58] can just become attitude it's just day
[1:16:00] in day out this is just life tomorrow
[1:16:03] will be another day we've got to go
[1:16:08] beyond that
[1:16:09] we've got to apply our token God has
[1:16:13] spoken to us and he's told us the kind
[1:16:16] of life that would be pleasing to God
[1:16:17] you know I'm afraid that some people
[1:16:20] don't catch what's taking place
[1:16:25] why don't we forget what he's spoken to
[1:16:27] us it seems sometimes we forget because
[1:16:31] a prophet a prophet
[1:16:33] you know Esther wanted to know what the
[1:16:35] King liked right because the the life of
[1:16:38] Israel depended on Easter getting into
[1:16:40] that position so she had to know what
[1:16:44] the King wanted and that's what brother
[1:16:46] Brennan's done for us he's let us know
[1:16:48] what the king wants but then time goes
[1:16:51] on what do we do we forget oh well you
[1:16:53] know we can't forget what he wants you
[1:17:01] know
[1:17:01] wyff's we sang that song make way for
[1:17:04] liberty and you know I'm a strong
[1:17:05] believer in Liberty I preached on
[1:17:07] Liberty I believe in Liberty but just
[1:17:11] what the Lord's been dealing with you
[1:17:12] I'm afraid some people use Liberty as an
[1:17:14] excuse to fulfill the lusts of the flesh
[1:17:17] because there's Liberty there but the
[1:17:21] the word always creaks and we've got to
[1:17:23] make sure we don't use Liberty vice
[1:17:25] versa to justify the way that we
[1:17:28] actually feel for ourselves because
[1:17:30] that's that that puts us in danger of
[1:17:33] the judgment lord have mercy on us and I
[1:17:38] believe that that can put you in bondage
[1:17:41] you say I'm free from bondage I'm
[1:17:43] justified I have Liberty I'm free from
[1:17:46] bondage but you don't actually realize
[1:17:47] you were actually in bondage and using
[1:17:49] Liberty as an excuse that's that's what
[1:17:53] I pray against I say Lord what do you
[1:17:56] want me to wear my wife asked me when
[1:17:58] she dresses do you think this looks
[1:18:00] right it's just too tight or is it do
[1:18:03] you think it looks right and sometimes I
[1:18:05] might that's pretty you know here
[1:18:07] brothers know it's pretty hard thing to
[1:18:09] say well actually that does look too
[1:18:11] tight but I think we have you know
[1:18:17] because brother Brennan didn't just
[1:18:19] wasn't a woman hater he didn't just
[1:18:21] blast woman he said shame on you man you
[1:18:24] don't have the guts to stand up so it
[1:18:27] comes down to the men as well but see we
[1:18:30] should diligently seek what the king
[1:18:32] wants today because all everything that
[1:18:34] we could do you know and we
[1:18:38] do we dress to please the king the way
[1:18:44] he wants us to be and be in risk of
[1:18:47] being called old-fashioned or would we
[1:18:49] rather and we what are we looking for we
[1:18:51] want someone to say well it's a pretty
[1:18:53] nice type you've got on tonight you know
[1:18:54] is it what wears out we are we wanting
[1:18:57] our affection to come from because for
[1:18:59] me I want my affection to come from the
[1:19:02] word I want it to come from him where I
[1:19:04] know the Lord's pleased and something
[1:19:06] I'm what then okay let me say this ever
[1:19:12] brothers brother would be ashamed to
[1:19:14] take his wife so we wouldn't want to
[1:19:17] take his wife because it's not a nice
[1:19:18] place to take his wife but he would go
[1:19:20] there himself but he wouldn't take his
[1:19:22] wife here because it's not a nice place
[1:19:24] to take his wife then what did Jesus
[1:19:26] feel like about you going there as his
[1:19:28] wife see we should think about the
[1:19:32] places that we go to because he loves
[1:19:34] you and he wants you to be safely
[1:19:37] protected and come under their banner
[1:19:38] under that protection under that token
[1:19:40] so we should be considering and our own
[1:19:43] selves what is pleasing to the King what
[1:19:47] is pleasing to him that's my prayer and
[1:19:49] I just ask you the question it's your
[1:19:51] responsibility it's my responsibility as
[1:19:54] a husband to my wife if you don't have a
[1:19:56] husband if you don't have a wife it's
[1:19:57] your responsibility to pray to get down
[1:20:00] into the spirit of Revelation and say
[1:20:02] Lord here's my life I lay it down what
[1:20:05] do you want because I you know we don't
[1:20:08] want people to lust after us we don't
[1:20:10] want people to we don't want to become
[1:20:12] proud we don't want to have pride right
[1:20:14] there's all these things that we don't
[1:20:16] want to be we just want to live for God
[1:20:18] and escape the wrath that's coming on
[1:20:20] this earth we want to serve Him because
[1:20:22] we love Him
[1:20:23] I want to serve him because I love him
[1:20:25] if there was anything I could do if you
[1:20:27] could come to me and say brother James
[1:20:29] you're doing something and it's that's
[1:20:31] the word says you shouldn't do that or
[1:20:33] maybe it's not in the word maybe say
[1:20:36] look the Prophet said that the king like
[1:20:38] this I would say Lord break that thing
[1:20:41] out of me do whatever you've got to do
[1:20:44] because I just want to please him that's
[1:20:46] all that matters to me is that I place
[1:20:48] him let us be squeezed
[1:20:52] I say let the squeeze come on the bright
[1:20:54] Lord squeeze me and juice me out let all
[1:20:56] my flesh be left behind put me through
[1:20:59] the juice pulper Amen that judgment is
[1:21:05] here and I believe those angels that
[1:21:07] holding back that the last the last
[1:21:10] great woe from coming in this it's so
[1:21:13] hard to hold back that judgment and
[1:21:15] there trembling and then once they go
[1:21:17] they're not just going to be let us go
[1:21:20] and that judgment straight down that's
[1:21:24] something that's just going to happen in
[1:21:26] a sudden and that same sudden moment
[1:21:28] that Brides you know just as judgments
[1:21:31] coming down the bride's going up just as
[1:21:33] judgment come down on Israel Moses lead
[1:21:36] the children out amen
[1:21:39] let's make sure we were there you know
[1:21:42] eight people win in the ark but one
[1:21:45] walked with God I want to be that one I
[1:21:49] want to be with that one in a million
[1:21:51] sorry everybody else but that's me if
[1:21:55] you want to claim that that's you that's
[1:21:56] fine but I'm claiming that that's me
[1:21:58] Amen brother Andy I come up and help me
[1:22:03] but maybe we can maybe we can stand and
[1:22:06] maybe we'll just sing a song and we'll
[1:22:09] pray and just say Lord search me search
[1:22:12] my heart I pledge allegiance to the land
[1:22:14] search my heart Lord if there's anything
[1:22:18] in me any wicked way any anything that
[1:22:20] could just be purged out of me that I
[1:22:22] would not be in risk of being here for
[1:22:24] that then just purge it out of me
[1:22:26] because what is life what am i living
