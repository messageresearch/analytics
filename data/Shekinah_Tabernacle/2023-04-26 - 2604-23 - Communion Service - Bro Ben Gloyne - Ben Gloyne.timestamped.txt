[23:06] word of prayer tonight amen as we

[23:10] Heavenly Father we're so thankful we can
[23:12] gather together this night Lord in your
[23:14] divine presence Lord we just want to ask
[23:16] Lord you would cover us in your blood
[23:17] Lord may he forgive us of all of our
[23:19] sins and our trespasses and Lord as we
[23:21] approach your table tonight Lord to take
[23:23] the Lord's Supper as we call it Lord I I
[23:25] pray God may you be very near Lord Jesus
[23:27] may this be a sacred moment for us we

[23:49] and Glory we love you Lord and we thank
[23:51] you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God
[23:54] bless you friends you may have your
[23:55] seats tonight I'm not going to be long
[23:57] because we want to get through foot
[23:58] washing as well tonight but I just want
[24:00] to draw your attention here we have uh
[24:02] you could say you know this is the
[24:04] Passover we just read about and we and
[24:06] we see it's uh a shadow of the communion
[24:09] you know of the Lord's table where where
[24:11] the blood had to be applied where the
[24:12] you know the lamb uh had to be slain the
[24:15] blood had to be applied but I just want
[24:17] you to notice this that you know this
[24:19] this this night where it was going to be
[24:21] the last night you know when this
[24:22] happens when the last night they're
[24:23] going to be in Egypt then God was going
[24:25] to take them into another land and they
[24:27] had to be dressed to go I mean they
[24:29] weren't they weren't just lounging
[24:30] around but they were dressed and ready
[24:31] to leave where where we read there in um
[24:34] verse 11 and thus shall he eat it with
[24:37] your loins girded your shoes on your
[24:39] feet and your staff in your hand and you
[24:41] shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[24:43] passovers they were dressed to leave
[24:45] amen and I believe as the Bride of Jesus
[24:47] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[24:49] amen we are dressed to leave this world
[24:51] Amen because that's why we take the
[24:53] communion because remember our Christian
[24:54] journey is not just for this Earthly
[24:56] part of it really this is the very small
[24:58] part of our Christian Journey but the
[25:00] whole Christian journey is actually
[25:01] leaving this world and going into Glory
[25:03] I mean that's why Jesus died on Calvary
[25:05] that are that our sins we wouldn't just
[25:07] be forgiven but our sins would be taken
[25:08] from us amen his nature the nature of
[25:10] the Lamb our sacrifice we're coming to
[25:12] you and I he'd be the Christian in our
[25:14] lives he'd live a living testimony
[25:16] through us and then he'd take us in a
[25:18] Rapture amen he'd take us into Glory
[25:20] because you know we know under the blood
[25:22] of bulls and goats that the life of that
[25:23] animal could never come into the human
[25:25] being and change their nature so if they
[25:27] were born with a yeah we're all born
[25:29] with a fallen sinful nature and under
[25:31] the blood of bulls and goats that could
[25:32] never be changed but under the blood of
[25:34] Jesus Christ when his when his life
[25:36] comes into you the life and your lamb
[25:38] comes into you then then he changes your
[25:40] nature from unbelief into Faith amen
[25:42] where it's no longer doubting Fallen
[25:44] nature amen but it's it's the nature of
[25:46] God Amen as the Apostle Paul said the
[25:48] life I now live I live by the faith of
[25:51] the Son of God and the reason he could
[25:52] say it is because he met the Lord on the
[25:54] road to Damascus and the lamb the life
[25:56] of Jesus Christ came into him and
[25:58] transformed his life and I trust that is
[26:00] your testimony tonight that God Jesus
[26:03] Christ is not just a God to you in terms
[26:05] of a tradition or a story or a way of
[26:07] you're being raised but he became alive
[26:09] to you that he stepped out of history
[26:11] and you met him because you can meet him
[26:13] tonight amen he's a living God Amen and
[26:15] and he wants to walk with you and I yes
[26:17] amen so so they had to be dressed and
[26:19] they were ready to leave and I believe
[26:21] that we are dressed Amen in the wedding
[26:24] robe right now the wedding at the Holy
[26:26] Ghost the word is the waiting robe amen
[26:28] it would say in Revelations 19 for the
[26:30] bride has made herself ready let us be
[26:33] glad and rejoice for the marriage the
[26:34] lamb has come that Union happens on the
[26:36] side and we go to the marriage supper in
[26:38] the year amen amen because it was
[26:40] granted unto her she'll be a raid in a
[26:42] fine learning and clean and white which
[26:43] is the righteousness of saints
[26:45] Hallelujah so I trust that that is that
[26:47] is your testimony you're being robbed in
[26:49] his righteousness not your own
[26:50] righteousness that's but filthy rags but
[26:52] his righteousness amen and you've been
[26:54] you've you know you've put on the whole
[26:56] armor of God and you're ready to leave
[26:58] you know what I love about the um you
[27:01] know they left Egypt under the strength
[27:03] of that sacrifice and it took them all
[27:05] the way into the promised land where
[27:07] Moses would say many years later your
[27:09] shoes didn't wear out there's not a
[27:10] feeble one among you and the reason is
[27:12] that is because they took the Passover
[27:14] and the power of God came into their
[27:16] lives and they left and it's so
[27:18] important that we stay in Passover amen
[27:20] right we don't just we don't just have
[27:22] have a one-time meeting with God and
[27:24] that's it but we're continually walking
[27:26] with them having communion with them
[27:27] every day that we are living in Passover
[27:30] where we're becoming one with him all
[27:32] the time him and his word his word must
[27:35] become one amen it's not just it's not
[27:37] in here but in our hearts I mean because
[27:39] if we become one with his word it has
[27:41] out outflowing in our lives his nature
[27:44] how he would react to such you know your
[27:46] situations it's him that does it it's
[27:48] not our carnal nature that does it
[27:50] Hallelujah so you know we're living in a
[27:52] tremendous hour where where where God
[27:55] and his bride has become one I mean
[27:58] we've been United isn't it incredible
[27:59] thing where the great king of glory when
[28:01] he went to Calvary he had you on his
[28:03] mind and he said the joy set before him
[28:05] was you redeemed amen he looked beyond
[28:07] the pain and the scars and the rejection
[28:08] the mocking and everything he had to
[28:10] suffer he looked beyond that because he
[28:12] saw you on the other side imperfection
[28:15] rejoicing with him throughout eternity
[28:17] Hallelujah so you know I'm so thankful
[28:20] that God puts us in condition that we
[28:22] cannot miss the Rapture if you've met
[28:24] him right we cannot miss it you know
[28:26] many times we read down through first
[28:28] Thessalonians 4 The Rapture cycle we
[28:30] know we've heard the you know the shot
[28:32] is the message of the other the words
[28:33] gone forth The Gather of Bride and you
[28:35] know but but but we many times we just
[28:37] read chapter four and we finished
[28:38] reading but but Paul didn't put the
[28:40] chapter in verse in so the so the
[28:42] thought continues down into chapter five
[28:45] where he says but Brethren other times
[28:46] and Seasons I don't need to know you I
[28:48] mean tell you because you know perfectly
[28:49] well because you're because you're
[28:51] Children of the light not of Darkness
[28:53] that that day would overtake you as a
[28:55] thief
[28:55] I mean so we're dressed and we're ready
[28:57] to leave when he calls we're going
[28:59] Hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[29:03] Hallelujah so I think we should I think
[29:05] we should approach the table with such
[29:07] Thanksgiving tonight
[29:08] we're we're under expectation for the
[29:11] dead in Christ to rise amen we're under
[29:13] expectation for these bodies to be
[29:15] changed I mean we're under expectation
[29:17] to meet our Lord in the air where it's
[29:19] not just a pipe dream pie in the sky but
[29:21] it's a reality and that's why the Holy
[29:23] Ghost sweeps down service after service
[29:25] when you're praying or driving or
[29:26] wherever you may be and God just comes
[29:28] real close to you because he's because
[29:29] he's raising your expectation he's
[29:31] letting you know I'm going to carry you
[29:33] away one day it's not just going to be a
[29:35] sweeping feeling of his presence but
[29:37] he's gonna that presence is gonna so
[29:38] envelop us and and we're going to be
[29:40] changed before we realize it I mean all
[29:43] because of what he has done for you and
[29:45] I it's not what we have done it's what
[29:47] he has done what he has done matters
[29:49] what we do actually doesn't matter and
[29:51] his great economy remember we're not
[29:53] going to stand there on the on that side
[29:56] and say praise the Lord and what I did
[29:58] too
[29:59] right there won't be any praise directed
[30:01] at ourselves
[30:03] amen at what we have done for him it's
[30:05] it'll all be directed of what he has
[30:07] done for us and that's how it should be
[30:09] for you and I in our Earthly Journey
[30:11] right now when we realize that we stand
[30:13] because of the grace of God we were
[30:15] called by the grace of God we stand
[30:17] because of the grace of God we overcome
[30:19] by the grace of God we're Victorious by
[30:21] the grace of God that we overcome by the
[30:23] blood 11 the word of Our Testimony and
[30:26] our testimony should be God's word is
[30:27] true it can never fail amen it will
[30:30] stand the test and standard the test for
[30:32] thousands of years it will stand in this
[30:33] day like it did in every previous day
[30:35] and we will overcome that way Hallelujah
[30:38] why because our all-sufficient lamb our
[30:42] powerful lamb amen he's the mightiest
[30:43] one he conquered hell death in the grave
[30:45] amen there's nothing that he did not
[30:47] conquer everything is under his feet but
[30:49] you must have perfect confidence in your
[30:51] lamb amen because remember if you start
[30:53] to put the pressure on yourself what
[30:56] you've subconsciously done is put is
[30:57] actually you don't have perfect
[30:59] confidence in him anymore
[31:00] because your confidence is shifted
[31:02] because now you've come into the picture
[31:03] but if you're perfect if your confidence
[31:05] is in your perfect lamb there's no
[31:08] pressure on you there's pressure on him
[31:10] amen who's the one that fulfills the
[31:12] word it's not actually you and I he may
[31:14] use us to do it but it's him that
[31:15] fulfills it in our lives amen so we've
[31:18] got to have confidence if he's fulfilled
[31:19] his word in the past he'll do it again
[31:21] remember he did not call Israel to leave
[31:24] them
[31:25] right Caleb and Joshua took the Passover
[31:28] Lamb amen they left Egypt dressed
[31:30] Hallelujah and and Moses said there's a
[31:33] different spirit with them and that
[31:34] anointing upon them was the anointing of
[31:35] God and they took their promised land
[31:37] and I believe I'm looking at a room of
[31:39] people under the same kind of anointing
[31:41] Amen to take every Divine promise of God
[31:44] because God's given it to you
[31:46] Hallelujah so it is such a tremendous
[31:49] thing to think
[31:51] there'll be a time when we take this
[31:52] communion last time
[31:55] you know that that just like the you
[31:57] know the Lord Jesus you know it says
[31:59] that yeah yeah we call it the last
[32:00] supper There were suppers before this
[32:02] but they came to a last one and he knew
[32:05] this is the end
[32:06] of this
[32:07] it's going to be far greater than this
[32:09] it's going to take a lot of sacrifice
[32:10] I'm going to give my life to make it
[32:12] greater than this but but friends if you
[32:14] you know no Daddy looked in his eyes of
[32:17] his disciples
[32:18] because I didn't grasp what was going on
[32:21] and and maybe he thought if they only
[32:23] caught it they will when I race they
[32:25] will see they all understand what's all
[32:27] been done yes
[32:29] yes and I believe we're we're we've seen
[32:32] what he's done amen and we're under no
[32:35] expectation this could be the last time
[32:38] we take the Lord's Supper on this side
[32:40] this is the last opportunity because
[32:42] remember when you take because remember
[32:43] before they're they're in they're in um
[32:46] Egypt remember it was the family and the
[32:48] lamb was separate
[32:49] then the lamb was killed the blood was
[32:51] applied but then it wasn't only that
[32:53] they became one with their sacrifice
[32:56] and it's the same thing with you and I
[32:57] how do we know you know the reason we
[33:00] know the blood has been applied in our
[33:01] lives is because the life of our
[33:03] sacrifices come into us which is the
[33:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost right and then
[33:08] now it's no longer our sacrifice in us
[33:10] as a two we're now one
[33:13] it's just like when you when you we know
[33:15] there's just some symbolic of his blood
[33:17] and we know that unleavened bread is is
[33:19] symbolizing his body right but then
[33:22] after you've taken communion this and
[33:24] you are not separate
[33:26] you walk out it's part of you right it
[33:29] becomes part of your cells I mean you
[33:31] you know your body takes that food your
[33:33] takes the wine takes the bread digestion
[33:35] and then it becomes part of your body
[33:36] yeah that's the same thing with our
[33:38] sacrifice spiritually he becomes part of
[33:40] us as we become part of him that means
[33:43] there's no longer us living it's him
[33:45] living in US
[33:47] so this is a very sacred thing oh yeah
[33:49] you know this is a tremendous thing
[33:51] amen where we can we can come and we can
[33:53] make a public declaration saying I and
[33:56] My Sacrifice are one
[33:59] it's no longer either liveth but Christ
[34:00] that now liveth in me
[34:02] Hallelujah
[34:04] amen so I trust you're dressed and ready
[34:06] to leave
[34:07] this world
[34:09] amen let's um let's just go to First
[34:11] Corinthians 11. I just wanted to keep it
[34:13] short because we want to have the
[34:14] comedian have foot washing as well
[34:16] because we know the two go hand in hand
[34:17] so we're just going to go to First
[34:19] Corinthians 11 and we're going to read
[34:20] from verse 23 because we know this is a
[34:23] very rejoicing time I know I'll probably
[34:25] say this every time it is a rejoicing
[34:27] time
[34:28] my sins are gone
[34:30] I'm saved hey man I'm redeemed by the
[34:33] blood of the Lamb when I couldn't save
[34:35] myself he came down and saved me so
[34:37] glory to God I wasn't looking for him
[34:39] but he was lucky for me and he found me
[34:40] amen because it's not it's not within
[34:42] man to seek after God if you've got a
[34:44] hunger for God that's God put it in you
[34:46] that's a supernatural move of God Amen
[34:49] if you've got a hunger for righteousness
[34:50] that's God doing that it's not you you
[34:52] didn't choose him he chose you I mean so
[34:55] it's a it's a rejoicing thing but now
[34:57] it's like but but they were told don't
[34:59] have any living
[35:00] get rid of all the leaven yeah so don't
[35:03] have any malice Strife Envy backbiting
[35:06] Pride arrogancy anything don't have that
[35:09] kind of living in your life when you
[35:11] come and take the communion sweep it out
[35:13] of the house
[35:14] right so it's a very it's a very sacred
[35:17] thing too because remember or well let's
[35:19] just read then we'll come to it it says
[35:21] in verse 23 here for I have received of
[35:23] the Lord
[35:23] that which also I delivered unto you
[35:25] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[35:28] which he was betrayed took bread and
[35:30] when he had given thanks he'd break it
[35:31] and said take eat this is my body which
[35:34] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[35:36] of me after the same man also he took
[35:39] the cup which he had when he had sup
[35:41] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[35:43] my blood this do ye as often as you
[35:45] drink it in remembrance of me for pardon
[35:48] me as often as you
[35:49] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[35:52] show the Lord's death till he come
[35:53] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[35:55] and drink this cup of the Lord
[35:57] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[36:00] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[36:01] examine himself
[36:04] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[36:06] of that cup for he that drink eateth and
[36:09] drinketh unworthily eateth and drink his
[36:11] damnation to himself not Discerning the
[36:13] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[36:16] and sickly among you and many sleep
[36:18] for if we for if we would judge
[36:21] ourselves we should not be judged but
[36:23] when we are judged we are chastened of
[36:25] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[36:27] with the world wherefore my brethren
[36:29] when you come together to eat tarry one
[36:31] for another and if any man hunger let
[36:33] him eat at home for ye come not together
[36:35] under condemnation and the rest will I
[36:38] set in order when I come so the Apostle
[36:40] Paul makes it very clear we've got to
[36:42] examine ourselves Lord do I have any
[36:44] unforgiveness do I have any ought does
[36:46] he not have any ought against me is
[36:48] anything that's not not made right
[36:50] anything is not under the blood in my
[36:51] life that's examining right and that's
[36:54] what we need to do
[36:56] because it says many are sick and many
[36:57] sleep
[36:58] because of this right so it's not just
[37:01] something we come and take casually and
[37:02] this is just part of church what no no
[37:04] it's not about that you're making a
[37:06] public declaration Me and My Sacrifice
[37:09] have become one so it's no longer my
[37:12] Humanity living but it's crisis Living
[37:13] Through Me
[37:15] so I think we should we should approach
[37:17] this you know you know approach the
[37:18] Lord's table with Thanksgiving but also
[37:21] with utmost sincerity and reverence so
[37:24] make sure everything is fine
