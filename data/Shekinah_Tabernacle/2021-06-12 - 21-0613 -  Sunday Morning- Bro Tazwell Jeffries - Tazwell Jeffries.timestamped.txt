[1:07:17] and we'll see how the lord leads if you
[1:07:20] can turn to the book of numbers
[1:07:23] chapter 13.
[1:07:30] just numbers chapter 13
[1:07:33] just a few verses there
[1:07:37] 13 verse 1 and 2 and the lord
[1:07:41] speak unto moses saying send thou men
[1:07:44] that they may search the land of canaan
[1:07:46] which i give
[1:07:47] unto the children of israel of every
[1:07:50] tribe of their fathers
[1:07:52] shall you send men everyone a ruler
[1:07:55] among them and then verse 25
[1:08:01] says and they returned from searching of
[1:08:05] the
[1:08:05] land after 40 days
[1:08:09] and we'll jump down to verse 32 it says
[1:08:12] and they brought up
[1:08:13] an evil report of the land which they
[1:08:16] had searched
[1:08:17] unto the children of israel saying the
[1:08:20] land
[1:08:20] through which we have gone to search it
[1:08:23] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[1:08:25] thereof and all the people that we saw
[1:08:28] in it
[1:08:29] are men of a great statue and there we
[1:08:32] saw the giants the sons of
[1:08:34] enoch which come out of the giants and
[1:08:37] we were in
[1:08:38] our own sight as grasshoppers
[1:08:42] and so we were in their sight
[1:08:45] then if you could just turn me to john
[1:08:48] chapter 14 john chapter 14
[1:08:57] just one verse in john chapter 14.
[1:09:02] it says here
[1:09:07] let not verse one let
[1:09:10] not your heart be troubled
[1:09:14] you believe in god believe also
[1:09:17] in me then the last one is second peter
[1:09:22] chapter one just read two verses then
[1:09:25] then we can
[1:09:26] pray and take our seats
[1:09:30] second peter one i'll read verse 3 and
[1:09:33] verse 4 according
[1:09:36] as his divine power had given unto us
[1:09:38] all things that pertaineth unto life
[1:09:41] and godliness through the knowledge of
[1:09:44] him that hath called us
[1:09:45] to glory and virtue whereby are given
[1:09:49] unto us exceeding great and precious
[1:09:53] promises that by these
[1:09:56] you might be partakers of the divine
[1:10:00] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:10:03] that is in the world through lust let's
[1:10:06] just pray lord
[1:10:07] your word has been read and father i
[1:10:11] believe all things are in order
[1:10:14] you speak this morning in jesus name
[1:10:17] amen you may be seated this morning in
[1:10:19] the presence of god
[1:10:24] amen just let me go back to that
[1:10:28] scripture
[1:10:30] so before i i start i just got this
[1:10:33] quote that i wanted to read
[1:10:36] um but the brandon says here
[1:10:40] in the message speak to this mountain
[1:10:44] he says i believe that the church
[1:10:48] of the living god and i believe i'm
[1:10:51] speaking to the church
[1:10:52] of the living god he says i believe that
[1:10:55] the church of the living god is
[1:10:58] moving into a sphere now that's going
[1:11:01] to shake the whole world
[1:11:05] and then he quotes he says ask anything
[1:11:08] that you will
[1:11:10] and it shall be given unto you
[1:11:13] now i want to just drop that with us
[1:11:15] this morning
[1:11:16] ask what you will
[1:11:19] he says it shall be given unto you
[1:11:23] anything you desire don't you see
[1:11:26] he says the words of jesus christ
[1:11:29] being fulfilled oh it's going to come
[1:11:34] to pass pretty soon he says i'm looking
[1:11:37] for it
[1:11:38] to happen in this meeting
[1:11:42] he says i'm wanting it to happen
[1:11:46] now that the anointing will strike the
[1:11:49] whole
[1:11:50] church of the living god and she'll rise
[1:11:53] to her feet
[1:11:54] like a mighty marching army
[1:11:58] and i believe the god that i serve
[1:12:01] is not a god of history
[1:12:04] but is a god of now
[1:12:07] so whatever i need now
[1:12:12] i can ask him by faith
[1:12:17] and he will do what he what he's
[1:12:21] more than able to do so before i just go
[1:12:24] with this one one more quote he says
[1:12:26] in the adoption part 4 he says he says
[1:12:29] he says that's what bothers me though he
[1:12:32] says
[1:12:33] to preach to you people and then he
[1:12:37] he drops in this which really struck
[1:12:40] them he says
[1:12:41] don't remain on
[1:12:44] in the same condition
[1:12:47] you've been going in
[1:12:51] he says change now
[1:12:55] so basically he's saying don't continue
[1:12:58] in the same whatever condition you are
[1:13:02] he says change now he says
[1:13:06] hear me as i say it and then in capital
[1:13:09] letters it says here
[1:13:11] thus saith the lord
[1:13:14] so i believe the god that i serve is a
[1:13:17] god
[1:13:18] that changes situations changes lives
[1:13:22] now it doesn't matter i know i'm i'm as
[1:13:24] we're going to go through the service
[1:13:26] this morning i'm
[1:13:27] i'm ministering to to christians this
[1:13:29] morning
[1:13:30] i believe we all the majority of us we
[1:13:33] are christians
[1:13:34] we've had our experiences with god but
[1:13:38] i believe as a christian it's not me
[1:13:40] standing on one place
[1:13:42] and not moving forward we need to grow
[1:13:46] and he's calling you and me up higher
[1:13:49] and higher and higher so i read that
[1:13:52] and i say i've got to change i've got to
[1:13:55] allow him
[1:13:57] i've got to allow the word to bring a
[1:14:00] change in my life
[1:14:02] i remember when this one time a service
[1:14:05] back in
[1:14:06] in the in the church back home and you
[1:14:08] know it's so important
[1:14:10] that that these kinds of meetings we do
[1:14:12] not take it for granted
[1:14:14] that the preaching of the word it's it's
[1:14:17] so powerful
[1:14:19] um i remember i ministered the sermon i
[1:14:22] can't remember what it was
[1:14:23] but i ministered a sermon back home
[1:14:26] and uh after the meeting we went home
[1:14:29] and then i got a text from a brother
[1:14:31] that was in the meeting
[1:14:34] and he said brother tez i was sitting in
[1:14:35] the meeting
[1:14:37] and he says as the word of god came
[1:14:40] forth
[1:14:41] he says i was sitting there and i knew
[1:14:44] that there were circumstances
[1:14:46] there was some demonic forces that was
[1:14:49] keeping me bound
[1:14:51] but it says tears as the word of god
[1:14:56] was being preached i sat there
[1:15:00] and i received the word of god
[1:15:03] he says as i received it
[1:15:07] i felt those demons of
[1:15:10] oppression leave me amen
[1:15:14] and then a couple of weeks later
[1:15:18] i get another text from someone else
[1:15:22] not in the local assembly he says where
[1:15:25] the tears
[1:15:27] i i i went to the archives
[1:15:30] somehow the sermon popped up i listened
[1:15:33] to it
[1:15:34] he says where the tears as i was
[1:15:36] listening and receiving
[1:15:39] he says for the tears i felt demons
[1:15:43] leave me two or three witnesses
[1:15:47] speaking about the power of the word of
[1:15:50] god
[1:15:52] so i want to encourage you this morning
[1:15:55] however the lord leads receive
[1:15:58] the word amen as
[1:16:01] we receive the word we become
[1:16:04] the word quote to brother branham
[1:16:10] so just for the title this morning
[1:16:13] um i've got here
[1:16:18] out of that script of saint john
[1:16:22] let not your heart
[1:16:25] be troubled and then
[1:16:29] adding to that so let not your heart be
[1:16:34] troubled
[1:16:36] you are walking
[1:16:39] under great and precious
[1:16:46] promises
[1:16:50] let not your heart be troubled
[1:16:55] as sons and daughters of god
[1:16:59] we've got precious promises
[1:17:04] and as we're walking wherever we're
[1:17:06] walking
[1:17:08] we're walking under great
[1:17:11] and precious promises
[1:17:18] now the bible says
[1:17:21] jesus says let not your heart be
[1:17:24] troubled
[1:17:26] and jesus doesn't just say stuff just to
[1:17:28] say stuff
[1:17:31] so he says let not your heart
[1:17:34] be troubled and you know as human beings
[1:17:40] it's normal we go through life
[1:17:45] we love we're human beings
[1:17:48] we've got emotions that's the way he
[1:17:51] created us
[1:17:53] but jesus says let not
[1:17:57] your heart be troubled
[1:18:00] so i i thought i wanted to so what i did
[1:18:03] was
[1:18:04] i went into the strongs
[1:18:07] um and i just wanted to have a look to
[1:18:10] understand the context of
[1:18:12] this word troubled
[1:18:15] i'll just read you a few things here
[1:18:17] they say a troubled heart
[1:18:21] is a heart that causes
[1:18:25] what they call inward
[1:18:28] commotion and
[1:18:32] commotion is like a confused
[1:18:36] and it's a noisy disturbance
[1:18:40] so and i encourage you if you
[1:18:44] don't believe what i'm saying
[1:18:47] go into the greek lexicon go to strong's
[1:18:50] and you'll see this a troubled heart it
[1:18:53] causes that
[1:18:54] it's like an inward commotion
[1:18:57] so someone that that has got a troubled
[1:18:59] heart or it's troubled
[1:19:01] we might not see it on the outside if
[1:19:03] they're very good
[1:19:05] at masking themselves but deep inside
[1:19:10] it's like that it's a confusion and it's
[1:19:12] a disturbance and it's just a noisy
[1:19:15] disturbance inside
[1:19:19] also a troubled heart it's easier is to
[1:19:23] agitate
[1:19:25] it's to just make you feel troubled and
[1:19:28] just to make you feel
[1:19:29] nervous
[1:19:33] a troubled heart
[1:19:36] it can take away the calmness
[1:19:40] of the mind
[1:19:44] it says there it can disturb
[1:19:47] this word that's there it says disturbs
[1:19:51] equanimity which i believe
[1:19:54] is your your composure
[1:19:57] maybe you're a person that's very calm
[1:20:00] but a
[1:20:01] a troubled mind can come in
[1:20:04] and disturb that and and and and take
[1:20:07] away the calmness
[1:20:11] a troubled heart can also they say
[1:20:16] cause this quietness which is
[1:20:20] it makes you worry
[1:20:24] it makes you feel uneasy
[1:20:28] jesus says let not your heart
[1:20:33] be troubled i'll go further
[1:20:37] a troubled heart they say
[1:20:41] it makes you restless
[1:20:44] because you
[1:20:55] it strikes one spirit
[1:20:58] with fear and dread
[1:21:03] i believe fear
[1:21:06] happy to be corrected fear is a
[1:21:08] revelation
[1:21:09] from hell because
[1:21:13] fear it just when it takes
[1:21:16] over that's why jesus says fear not
[1:21:20] when fear takes over just man it
[1:21:23] it has terrible effects
[1:21:27] a troubled heart renders
[1:21:31] anxiousness or distress
[1:21:36] it perplexes the mind it makes the mind
[1:21:42] and then what it does also democracy of
[1:21:44] lots of confusion
[1:21:47] and then what it also does right it it
[1:21:50] suggests
[1:21:52] stuff in your mind
[1:21:55] it makes you you know the the situation
[1:21:58] it's just all in your mind but you
[1:22:00] already fetch the problem around there
[1:22:03] you've already
[1:22:04] decided that this is going to happen all
[1:22:06] the negative stuff
[1:22:12] now in the message amnesia one of one of
[1:22:16] them
[1:22:16] amnesia messages brother branham
[1:22:19] actually says
[1:22:21] he says worry
[1:22:24] can cause amnesia
[1:22:29] and amnesia it's something
[1:22:33] that uh you you you can't remember i
[1:22:36] think or
[1:22:36] you don't know who you are and um
[1:22:40] amnesia is i'm you know you you just
[1:22:42] forget things or you i think amnesia i
[1:22:44] don't know who i am
[1:22:46] so so a troubled heart
[1:22:49] causes all the worry it causes all the
[1:22:52] distress
[1:22:53] it causes all sorts of stuff that you
[1:22:57] end up really sometimes forgetting
[1:23:00] who you are and that is why i believe
[1:23:04] why
[1:23:04] why why jesus comes and he says
[1:23:08] let not your heart
[1:23:12] be troubled because jesus
[1:23:15] knows that a troubled heart
[1:23:18] causes all sorts of things and
[1:23:22] and it just makes you we're human right
[1:23:25] but but at the end of the day you know
[1:23:29] it doesn't want you to allow
[1:23:32] we're going to be troubled but it
[1:23:34] doesn't want you to allow
[1:23:37] that troubled heart to take over
[1:23:40] and that's where the lord just laid on
[1:23:42] my heart to say let
[1:23:44] not your heart be troubled you and i we
[1:23:47] are
[1:23:48] hawking under great and
[1:23:51] precious promises
[1:23:55] and as we go through the meeting this
[1:23:56] morning maybe yeah trust the lord
[1:23:58] he'll allow me just to to to to remind
[1:24:01] you
[1:24:03] of these precious promises that you have
[1:24:07] that you have that i have and that when
[1:24:10] we go out there
[1:24:12] and when trouble strikes or when our
[1:24:14] heart
[1:24:15] tries to be troubled that we can then
[1:24:18] just look back
[1:24:19] at the word and say
[1:24:22] yes these things are happening but i've
[1:24:25] got something great
[1:24:27] that will help me to move ahead
[1:24:32] and not to allow the troubled hearts
[1:24:37] not to allow this inward commotions
[1:24:42] to control me
[1:24:46] now i read the scripture in the book of
[1:24:50] numbers
[1:24:52] 13 and 14
[1:24:56] and um i actually labeled that
[1:24:59] section here on my notes i called it
[1:25:04] the kadish crisis
[1:25:08] i called it the kadish crisis now
[1:25:13] so so most of us and all of us should
[1:25:16] know
[1:25:16] what happened where 12 spies were sent
[1:25:20] out
[1:25:22] and they all came back
[1:25:26] with a report so they were sent out
[1:25:29] to spy out the land that
[1:25:33] god had given them that
[1:25:36] god had promised them so when they went
[1:25:40] out to go and
[1:25:41] spy out the land they went to go and spy
[1:25:44] out what was this
[1:25:49] so they went out 12 of them
[1:25:52] 12 of them came back
[1:25:55] and they came back with a report
[1:26:00] they came back and if you go look in the
[1:26:02] in numbers it says they came back
[1:26:05] with evidence
[1:26:08] they came back with evidence saying this
[1:26:11] is a good land so whatever god told us
[1:26:15] about this land
[1:26:17] it is true it's a good land
[1:26:22] and and here's the evidence i believe
[1:26:25] the scripture says there to carry
[1:26:27] uh the fruit on their shoulders
[1:26:31] so they they they came back with
[1:26:34] positive evidence to prove and to show
[1:26:38] that what god
[1:26:39] was telling them was absolutely the
[1:26:42] truth
[1:26:43] the land was good it was flowing with
[1:26:46] milk and honey
[1:26:47] the fruit was there everything was just
[1:26:50] beautiful
[1:26:54] so they came back with that report but
[1:26:57] as we know what happened in that
[1:27:01] kadish crisis
[1:27:05] there were ten of them
[1:27:09] that came back so they all of them came
[1:27:12] back with a
[1:27:13] a positive report of the goodness
[1:27:18] of the land but we know that
[1:27:22] 10 of them came back and they added some
[1:27:26] negativity into the reports
[1:27:32] and if i'll just read it it says here
[1:27:35] so they came back they said the land is
[1:27:37] good
[1:27:39] and they said nevertheless the people
[1:27:43] be strong that dwell in the land
[1:27:47] and our cities are hold sorry and this
[1:27:50] it is old and very great
[1:27:54] and we saw the children of enoch there
[1:27:59] and then they also said
[1:28:03] the men that went up with him said
[1:28:07] we are not able to go up
[1:28:10] against the people but they are stronger
[1:28:13] than
[1:28:14] us and they brought up
[1:28:18] an evil report of the land
[1:28:24] now this was probably a people
[1:28:27] like you and me
[1:28:30] god had given them it he told them
[1:28:35] that i'm taking you i'm taking you out
[1:28:38] of egypt
[1:28:39] and i'm leading you into a land
[1:28:43] flowing with bokeh a land that is
[1:28:47] yours a land that i want
[1:28:50] you to enjoy
[1:28:54] so you're the 10 of the 12 spies
[1:28:57] came back and they gave a report
[1:29:01] to the people
[1:29:04] and as the negative report
[1:29:07] started moving through the people
[1:29:12] people started
[1:29:15] feeling troubled
[1:29:19] that is why god says let not your heart
[1:29:24] be troubled
[1:29:27] so as the negative report started going
[1:29:30] out
[1:29:32] the people started just feeling
[1:29:36] like a defeated people
[1:29:39] because they heard about the giants and
[1:29:42] they heard about the
[1:29:44] the whole cities and all these things
[1:29:47] and they started then getting all
[1:29:50] nervous
[1:29:51] and they started getting all scared
[1:29:54] because they were listening
[1:29:56] to a negative report
[1:30:00] they opened their ears
[1:30:03] to negativity
[1:30:06] and as they opened and they received
[1:30:10] the negativity it started having an
[1:30:14] impact on their lives
[1:30:19] now this was a people that had
[1:30:23] left egypt had experienced a god
[1:30:29] that was able to pot the red sea
[1:30:34] this was a people that was
[1:30:37] following the purifier by night
[1:30:41] and following the cloud by day
[1:30:45] this was a people they were not strange
[1:30:49] to the supernatural for them the
[1:30:52] supernatural
[1:30:54] god was just part of the journey
[1:31:03] so you'd expect
[1:31:07] that a people that have seen god
[1:31:11] open up the red sea a people
[1:31:14] that had seen what god is able to do
[1:31:18] you would have expected them
[1:31:22] to say hey my god did then
[1:31:26] whatever i'm facing ahead he's going to
[1:31:29] do it
[1:31:34] but they allowed
[1:31:37] a negative report
[1:31:40] to come into their hearts and then they
[1:31:44] became a people that totally
[1:31:49] forgot
[1:31:52] a people and i will use the word
[1:31:55] that had amnesia
[1:31:59] i mean do you remember what god did
[1:32:02] we seen pharaoh and his army coming
[1:32:05] and we're seeing god perform the
[1:32:08] impossible
[1:32:10] we're seeing god opening the red sea
[1:32:14] and we've seen how we hooked on dry land
[1:32:20] because of the negative report that they
[1:32:24] received and they allowed it
[1:32:28] to consume them
[1:32:31] it made them forget
[1:32:34] about what god had done
[1:32:38] and it made them forget what god is
[1:32:41] able to do
[1:32:46] so they forgot about
[1:32:50] the supernatural that was leading them
[1:32:54] they forgot about the miracles that they
[1:32:58] had
[1:32:59] seen with their own eyes or that they
[1:33:02] had
[1:33:02] heard maybe young youngsters coming up
[1:33:07] they've heard it now we know
[1:33:11] that as you go through the scriptures
[1:33:14] and as you go through the book of
[1:33:15] numbers
[1:33:16] and as you go into the book of hebrews
[1:33:19] god
[1:33:20] refers back to that
[1:33:23] i'll use the word kadish crisis
[1:33:28] and god we know
[1:33:31] but if you don't know he was not happy
[1:33:36] because he hears his people
[1:33:40] he's proven himself to them
[1:33:44] over and over and over again but
[1:33:50] yet when they get faced with some
[1:33:53] adversity
[1:33:55] and they allow the
[1:33:58] the negative speaking guys
[1:34:02] to come and plant this negativity
[1:34:06] in them god
[1:34:10] was not happy
[1:34:14] he was displeased with him
[1:34:19] and we know if as you go through the
[1:34:20] scriptures there were repercussions
[1:34:23] of the decision that was made
[1:34:27] at kedesh because the end of the day
[1:34:30] because of the
[1:34:33] this the 12 spies that came with this
[1:34:36] negative stuff and it flowed over into
[1:34:40] the people
[1:34:41] and the people got all negative and
[1:34:43] their hearts were troubled
[1:34:45] and they just said no we can't we can't
[1:34:47] you know what they even said
[1:34:49] they said we look like grasshoppers in
[1:34:52] their eyes
[1:34:53] now they probably didn't hear them say
[1:34:55] ah look at those grasshoppers
[1:34:57] but they in their mind
[1:35:01] they told themselves whoa
[1:35:05] they big oh they probably think i'm a
[1:35:08] little gross
[1:35:12] so they allowed this whatever they were
[1:35:14] seeing
[1:35:16] whatever obstacles was facing them
[1:35:20] they allowed that to consume their mind
[1:35:25] and then they started this having this
[1:35:28] imaginations in their mind
[1:35:30] they probably dreamed at night how the
[1:35:32] sons of
[1:35:33] enoch would look at them and they would
[1:35:35] be hopping like grasshoppers
[1:35:38] and it consumed them and at the end of
[1:35:42] the day
[1:35:43] we know there were repercussions
[1:35:48] but you see god doesn't
[1:35:52] want us to focus on the negativity
[1:35:59] he wants me by the full to focus on the
[1:36:02] promises of god
[1:36:04] he wants me to focus on his
[1:36:08] word
[1:36:10] and his word is yea
[1:36:13] and amen his word
[1:36:17] is super powerful
[1:36:21] and i'm not just saying that i've
[1:36:24] experienced it
[1:36:26] i believe it when you stand here and you
[1:36:28] speak what you speak
[1:36:29] you speak out of an experience because i
[1:36:32] could stand here
[1:36:34] and i could tell you good stuff and good
[1:36:36] stories but it will not really have an
[1:36:39] impact because i'm just talking of your
[1:36:42] sake
[1:36:43] but i whatever whatever the lord is laid
[1:36:46] on my heart this morning
[1:36:48] it's coming off an experience and i am
[1:36:51] totally convinced
[1:36:55] that the god that i serve
[1:36:58] is more than powerful
[1:37:02] so in this kaddish crisis god was
[1:37:06] very very displeased with these
[1:37:10] 10 spies
[1:37:14] that came with this negative report
[1:37:19] he wanted them he wanted him to focus
[1:37:23] on his promises he promised it to them
[1:37:27] and all they had to do was just yes lord
[1:37:31] i receive it standstill what the brandon
[1:37:34] says
[1:37:34] in the message standstill he's talking
[1:37:37] about the kadish crisis
[1:37:39] he says and of course ten against two
[1:37:43] they were outnumbered he says but even
[1:37:47] though they were
[1:37:48] outnumbered he says joshua and
[1:37:51] caleb took their stand
[1:37:56] and they said we are more
[1:37:59] than able to do it
[1:38:05] he says but before caleb joshua could
[1:38:07] speak caleb had to stole
[1:38:09] the people first get them quiet too much
[1:38:12] murmuring too much talking too much
[1:38:14] confusion get them quiet
[1:38:17] stand still don't be running here
[1:38:20] running there
[1:38:22] he says now what made caleb
[1:38:26] so sure of it when the opposition
[1:38:30] was so great because caleb
[1:38:33] was one of those twelve that went out
[1:38:36] seen the goodness of the land at the
[1:38:38] same time
[1:38:39] seen the giants seeing the opposition
[1:38:42] but what made
[1:38:46] caleb so sure that we are more than able
[1:38:50] when the opposition was so great
[1:38:53] brother branham says it's according to
[1:38:56] what you looking at
[1:39:00] it's so important
[1:39:03] to be aware of what
[1:39:06] i am looking at
[1:39:11] he says caleb was looking at the promise
[1:39:14] of god
[1:39:16] so caleb remembered and he remembered
[1:39:19] the promise that god
[1:39:21] had given them and that was all on his
[1:39:24] mind
[1:39:26] he's seen the giants he's seen the
[1:39:28] negativity
[1:39:29] but he also seen the promises
[1:39:32] of god for him
[1:39:39] the other 10 was looking at
[1:39:42] circumstances
[1:39:44] if you go to look at circumstances
[1:39:47] oh now i know it's easy to say these
[1:39:49] things right i know it's easy to quote
[1:39:51] it
[1:39:52] easy to say don't look at your problems
[1:39:53] look at the promises of god
[1:39:56] it's easy to say but when when the
[1:39:58] situation strikes
[1:40:00] man that's a different story but god
[1:40:03] had to come and deal with me i've been
[1:40:06] going through situations
[1:40:08] where at the end of the day god and it
[1:40:10] was over a couple of years
[1:40:12] and god had to come and remind me
[1:40:15] stop looking at the problem yes and i
[1:40:18] think i said this one time
[1:40:20] yes the problem is there you can
[1:40:23] see it don't look at it don't
[1:40:26] focus on it just go a bit higher
[1:40:30] and look across and see the promises
[1:40:34] of god
[1:40:46] i think i mentioned that there was this
[1:40:48] quote i love about the brandon
[1:40:49] he talks about the joshua and the caleb
[1:40:52] outfit
[1:40:54] and i am grateful to god you see he
[1:40:56] identifies the
[1:40:58] joshua and the caleb outfit as the true
[1:41:01] believer
[1:41:02] and i identify myself as part of the
[1:41:05] joshua and caleb
[1:41:07] outfit i'm a true believer
[1:41:10] of this word of god absolutely
[1:41:15] he says now listen closely this is here
[1:41:20] when the word test came
[1:41:23] when they went over and they seen
[1:41:26] the opposition opposition so great
[1:41:29] it was the greatest opposition they
[1:41:33] ever seen the amalekites was
[1:41:36] ten times the size they said we look
[1:41:40] like grasshoppers
[1:41:42] the fences in the cities are so cold so
[1:41:45] they can run a chariot race around it
[1:41:48] he says why we look like
[1:41:51] grasshoppers we can't do it
[1:41:55] that was the negativity which just
[1:41:58] spread like wildfire
[1:42:00] amongst the believers but then brother
[1:42:03] branham says
[1:42:04] and two men that stood
[1:42:07] on the word caleb and joshua
[1:42:12] caleb and joshua outfit the
[1:42:15] true believer they stood
[1:42:19] on the word and caleb and joshua said
[1:42:23] wait a minute you've got two million
[1:42:26] people he says
[1:42:28] shut up just a minute sometimes you've
[1:42:30] got to just be strong
[1:42:32] caleb and joshua told him shut up
[1:42:35] we are more than able to do it
[1:42:40] we are more than a match for them
[1:42:45] what was they basing on they said god
[1:42:50] god said god said yes
[1:42:53] god said not men
[1:42:57] not circumstances god said
[1:43:01] i've given you the land it is
[1:43:04] yours god
[1:43:07] said it and if god
[1:43:10] says it i receive it
[1:43:17] yeah god said it
[1:43:21] so the bible says that with all the
[1:43:24] negativity around
[1:43:27] there were two men tell them
[1:43:31] i just love i love caleb and joshua
[1:43:35] i look at them and with the man i see
[1:43:38] him
[1:43:39] because i identify with their
[1:43:42] what this was with what they approach
[1:43:44] with the way they did things
[1:43:46] the way they handle situations and the
[1:43:49] way they just
[1:43:50] they didn't care about circumstances or
[1:43:52] problems
[1:43:53] or whatever their focus
[1:43:56] wasn't god
[1:44:02] this great warrior joshua brother
[1:44:04] branham says here he says
[1:44:06] caleb run out in the midst of the people
[1:44:08] and quieten them
[1:44:10] and said yes it can be
[1:44:13] and he said and joshua stood by him
[1:44:17] and said certainly it can be
[1:44:20] god's given it to us
[1:44:23] and then he says now every one of those
[1:44:27] israelites
[1:44:28] in the church he says everyone
[1:44:33] had the word of god preached to them
[1:44:37] but this is what made caleb
[1:44:41] and joshua different oh really says
[1:44:46] they all had the word
[1:44:50] of god preached to them
[1:44:53] but it only the word
[1:44:57] taken effect upon
[1:45:00] joshua and caleb so the old church
[1:45:05] was there they had the word of god
[1:45:08] preached to them
[1:45:09] but joshua and caleb as they received
[1:45:12] the word
[1:45:13] they said yes lord it's mine the
[1:45:16] promises
[1:45:17] it's mine and they allowed the word
[1:45:21] to take half and impact and
[1:45:24] effect on their lives
[1:45:27] and because they allowed the word to
[1:45:30] have an
[1:45:30] impact upon their lives their attitudes
[1:45:34] the way they handle things was totally
[1:45:37] different
[1:45:38] to the others because the others
[1:45:40] probably just sat in church
[1:45:42] heard a good sermon went home and forgot
[1:45:45] but caleb and joshua they sat in the
[1:45:48] meeting
[1:45:49] and they said yes lord i want i want i
[1:45:56] received
[1:46:01] they allowed the word to have an
[1:46:05] impact on them and you think of that
[1:46:08] word
[1:46:10] impact if you think of a beautiful lake
[1:46:14] it's quiet and peaceful
[1:46:18] you go stand there and it's just so
[1:46:21] beautiful
[1:46:22] so serene and you come
[1:46:26] back a couple of days time
[1:46:29] and the wind is howling
[1:46:32] and the wind is blowing
[1:46:36] and you go back to that same lake you
[1:46:38] find the wind
[1:46:40] the storm has got an impact
[1:46:44] on that lake and it's pushing the lake
[1:46:46] this way
[1:46:47] and the water is going and the water's
[1:46:49] going that way
[1:46:50] and the horde is boiling and then once
[1:46:53] the storm's upsides
[1:46:55] and you go back to that lake you find
[1:46:58] all the dirt
[1:47:00] all the rubbish has been churned out
[1:47:05] all the rubbish because the lake
[1:47:08] allowed the wind or the storm whatever
[1:47:12] to have an impact on itself
[1:47:16] and as we allow
[1:47:20] the world to have an
[1:47:23] impact on us
[1:47:26] whatever might be here that doesn't need
[1:47:29] to be it doesn't belong
[1:47:31] if we allow the word
[1:47:34] of god that's being preached this
[1:47:37] morning or just allow when you read the
[1:47:39] scripture
[1:47:39] when you listen to a sermon or brother
[1:47:41] branham when you may be listening to
[1:47:42] someone on youtube
[1:47:44] allow the word of god to have
[1:47:47] an impact on your life and you will see
[1:47:51] the difference
[1:47:55] so joshua and caleb they allowed
[1:47:59] the word to have an impact on them and
[1:48:03] brother says
[1:48:06] the word affected them
[1:48:10] because they had a fantastic attitude
[1:48:15] for them it was more than just going to
[1:48:18] church
[1:48:22] it's about allowing the word see
[1:48:25] every promise in the book is mine
[1:48:29] every chapter every verse and every line
[1:48:34] and that promise is for me and i
[1:48:37] receive it and wherever i'm going
[1:48:41] whatever situations i'm facing i know
[1:48:44] that there's promises of god
[1:48:48] that's hanging over me amen
[1:48:54] so because of caleb's attitude
[1:48:58] god was so pleased with caleb
[1:49:02] and with joshua he wasn't happy with the
[1:49:05] rest and
[1:49:05] there were consequences but god was so
[1:49:09] pleased with the attitude
[1:49:13] of joshua and of caleb and in numbers
[1:49:17] 14 24 god says
[1:49:21] but my servant caleb
[1:49:25] because he had another spirit with him
[1:49:29] and hath followed me fully
[1:49:34] fully yes caleb seen the stuff in the
[1:49:39] circumstances
[1:49:40] but that didn't bother him he followed
[1:49:43] god
[1:49:44] fully
[1:49:48] him the lord says well i bring into the
[1:49:52] land
[1:49:53] where into he went and he seed
[1:49:57] shall possess it now i think caleb was
[1:50:01] in his forties at the time
[1:50:02] when this happened that correctly was
[1:50:04] wrong but i think he was sort of
[1:50:06] about that age and then we discover
[1:50:08] later in the book of joshua
[1:50:10] about 40 years later so for 40 years
[1:50:14] caleb is walking caleb
[1:50:18] is fighting caleb is
[1:50:22] loving a life and he's just walking
[1:50:25] and he's walking and he's following god
[1:50:29] until we go in the book of joshua
[1:50:33] so caleb is walking and he's doing all
[1:50:35] the stuff
[1:50:36] but as is walking this word of god
[1:50:40] which was a promise to caleb
[1:50:44] and god called out caleb and said caleb
[1:50:48] this promise is for you can
[1:50:52] because you followed me fully i will
[1:50:54] bring you into the land
[1:50:56] and your seed shall possess it so caleb
[1:50:59] was walking
[1:51:00] and he was walking and fighting and all
[1:51:03] over caleb
[1:51:04] was the promise of god
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:09] and yes maybe canada went through
[1:51:11] situations afterwards
[1:51:14] but he knew that there was a promise
[1:51:17] hanging
[1:51:18] over him
[1:51:22] and then we know one day in the book of
[1:51:23] joshua how caleb becomes
[1:51:26] he comes to joshua and he reminds joshua
[1:51:29] of this promise that god had made
[1:51:33] to him and what was his words he says
[1:51:38] give me my mountain
[1:51:42] it's been promised to me
[1:51:48] the mountain probably whatever was there
[1:51:50] were inhabitants there
[1:51:52] but kind of said give it to me this car
[1:51:55] that has been with me
[1:51:56] all the time he promised
[1:52:00] that that is mine brother john it's mine
[1:52:03] i'm going to go there i'm going to
[1:52:06] possess
[1:52:07] it it's my inheritance
[1:52:10] god gave it to me
[1:52:17] that was caleb's attitude
[1:52:21] now caleb wasn't wishy-washy right he
[1:52:24] didn't it wasn't like
[1:52:25] fairy stories to him it wasn't just usa
[1:52:30] caleb knew she kind of had a revelation
[1:52:34] god had revealed to caleb
[1:52:37] this is yours that land is lost
[1:52:40] ask for it go forth possess it
[1:52:44] drive out the inhabitants that's there
[1:52:48] caleb i am with you
[1:52:51] i have promised it to you
[1:52:55] and that's why caleb could boldly come
[1:52:58] to joshua
[1:52:59] and say
[1:53:03] i'm 80 odd years old man
[1:53:07] i'm still strong and god promised it to
[1:53:11] me
[1:53:12] years ago i'm here now
[1:53:15] i want to claim my promise
[1:53:20] and yes i see this stuff there there's
[1:53:22] people there's obstacles
[1:53:23] i don't care god has given it
[1:53:27] to me so caleb
[1:53:31] was walking and living a life
[1:53:36] with the promises of god hanging
[1:53:39] over him and at the right time
[1:53:44] that specific promise for caleb
[1:53:47] he got it just a little bit of our
[1:53:51] promises
[1:53:52] so when god promises something it's your
[1:53:55] name
[1:53:56] amen he's promised it to you and to me
[1:54:00] the book of isaiah says i'll read the
[1:54:03] scripture it says therefore
[1:54:05] the lord himself shall give you a sign
[1:54:08] behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:54:12] and be a son and shall call his name
[1:54:16] emmanuel it was a prophecy that went out
[1:54:20] it was a promise i believe it went out
[1:54:23] and we know that prophecy was spoken
[1:54:26] whenever it was spoken
[1:54:29] and then years later we find a young
[1:54:32] mary
[1:54:34] little girl doing the things that little
[1:54:37] girls do
[1:54:38] playing around and enjoying life and
[1:54:41] whatever
[1:54:42] but that little mary she's running
[1:54:44] around
[1:54:46] but she doesn't know that
[1:54:49] over is a prophecy
[1:54:53] is that promise it's hovering over
[1:54:56] so wherever she went maybe she did some
[1:54:59] work for mama
[1:55:00] maybe maybe she helped dad a little bit
[1:55:02] you know whatever but wherever
[1:55:04] she went there was a promise
[1:55:08] there was a prophecy that was over
[1:55:11] she had no idea and maybe as you sit
[1:55:15] here this morning
[1:55:16] you might think that maybe i'm not you
[1:55:19] know where i'm supposed to be
[1:55:21] just allow god there's a promise
[1:55:25] hanging over you and me
[1:55:30] so this mary she's doing whatever she's
[1:55:32] doing until one day
[1:55:34] she gets a visitation and then this
[1:55:38] angel
[1:55:39] confirms to her now she obviously knew
[1:55:41] the scriptures
[1:55:42] she knew about this one and the angel
[1:55:45] confirms to her
[1:55:47] mary you are the one you
[1:55:51] are this performance of this prophecy
[1:55:54] so mary was walking before that unaware
[1:55:58] but there was this promise hanging over
[1:56:00] her
[1:56:02] and we know the outcome of that
[1:56:06] i read second peter one so that was mary
[1:56:09] and
[1:56:10] that was caleb so i wanna just let's
[1:56:12] just come to you and me
[1:56:15] because we are a people of promise
[1:56:19] there are so many great and
[1:56:22] precious promises
[1:56:25] in this world for you and for me
[1:56:30] and god wants you to see it he wants you
[1:56:33] to receive
[1:56:35] it because it's yours
[1:56:40] and you know we are back back in our
[1:56:43] family altar
[1:56:44] we've just been talking with with the
[1:56:46] kids with the family about the
[1:56:47] importance of revelation
[1:56:50] because the more god comes and he
[1:56:52] reveals
[1:56:54] this word to you and to me
[1:56:58] so as he opens himself up and as we
[1:57:01] start discovering
[1:57:03] man this promise is for me
[1:57:06] our attitude change our approach changes
[1:57:10] when we face circumstances even that the
[1:57:12] way we handle it changes
[1:57:17] so i read the scripture it says whereby
[1:57:20] are given unto us it's been
[1:57:23] given to us exceeding
[1:57:26] great great
[1:57:29] and precious promises
[1:57:34] it's brilliant boys being given to us
[1:57:38] it's mine it's yours
[1:57:42] you need to receive it
[1:57:48] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:57:54] that by these you might be
[1:57:57] partakers of the divine nature
[1:58:02] having escaped the corruption
[1:58:05] that is in the world through lust we
[1:58:08] are partakers for the simon we're not
[1:58:11] just
[1:58:12] spectators and looking and seeing ah
[1:58:16] god is doing amazing things every
[1:58:17] brother jameson but we are
[1:58:20] partakers we're part of it we are
[1:58:22] experiencing
[1:58:24] this word so when i read this bible and
[1:58:27] i said
[1:58:28] i find myself i think i was always with
[1:58:30] andy was the last week when you guys are
[1:58:32] saying about
[1:58:32] find yourself in the bible find the
[1:58:34] character identify yourself
[1:58:36] i identify myself with caleb and with
[1:58:39] joshua
[1:58:39] and when i look at what they did i said
[1:58:41] lord they were able to do it
[1:58:43] i'm able to do it the same god that
[1:58:45] helped them is there to help me
[1:58:53] so you and i we have great
[1:58:56] and precious promises
[1:59:00] i'll just i'll just i won't go into the
[1:59:02] detail of it
[1:59:03] but you've got a promise and there's a
[1:59:05] quote that i just love
[1:59:07] i use it all the time i just didn't use
[1:59:09] it today but i'm actually going to touch
[1:59:10] on it
[1:59:10] brother brahm says and and and i always
[1:59:13] say this is my quote that's for me it's
[1:59:14] dez
[1:59:15] because i read it ashitas in the statue
[1:59:17] of a perfect man
[1:59:18] but the venom comes we're not here to
[1:59:20] build organization
[1:59:21] christ did not send me to bold
[1:59:23] organization christ sent me to build up
[1:59:26] individuals so that they might be a
[1:59:29] powerhouse
[1:59:30] and the abiding place of the spirit by
[1:59:33] his word
[1:59:36] i read that and i say tears that's you
[1:59:41] yes brother andy that's you it's me
[1:59:45] so he is promised that he's bolding you
[1:59:47] up
[1:59:48] he's building us up into a
[1:59:51] powerhouse we've got
[1:59:55] great and precious promises
[1:59:59] promises of adoption
[2:00:03] i thank god for this revealed word
[2:00:07] i thank god for the message of malachi
[2:00:10] 4.
[2:00:12] where would i have been
[2:00:15] i think i told someone one time if it
[2:00:17] wasn't for god but the fall
[2:00:20] that came via the message of the hour
[2:00:25] into the home of my uncles
[2:00:28] it would i would not have been
[2:00:32] able to appreciate what
[2:00:35] i am appreciating today
[2:00:40] don't just think the message is another
[2:00:42] message this is
[2:00:44] power packed and it's for you
[2:00:48] and it's for me
[2:01:00] a promise of perfection
[2:01:04] be therefore perfect
[2:01:08] a promise of a body change
[2:01:12] we shall be changed
[2:01:20] i promise of you obtaining your
[2:01:24] individual inheritance
[2:01:29] a promise of overcoming
[2:01:33] that's your promises it's for you
[2:01:36] it's for me
[2:01:40] so when your heart becomes troubled
[2:01:45] remember you've got promises hanging
[2:01:48] over you
[2:01:51] and he wants you to receive
[2:01:57] you are an overcomer
[2:02:01] don't don't let the devil
[2:02:05] don't let circumstances don't let
[2:02:09] anything anything tell you difference
[2:02:14] you are a son and a daughter
[2:02:17] of the most high god and you conduct
[2:02:20] yourself
[2:02:21] like a son and a daughter of the most
[2:02:24] high god
[2:02:26] when the devil comes and you welcome you
[2:02:28] remind him
[2:02:30] who you are
[2:02:37] that you are an overcomer
[2:02:42] jesus knew who he was
[2:02:46] brother branham knew who
[2:02:49] he was
[2:02:57] oh god i want you and me
[2:03:00] to come to that realization where we
[2:03:03] know
[2:03:04] our position in the world
[2:03:07] where we come to that realization where
[2:03:10] we
[2:03:10] know who we are
[2:03:14] not just by speaking
[2:03:17] it's good to speak and we have to speak
[2:03:20] our promises
[2:03:23] but it's when you get faced with
[2:03:26] whatever you get faced with
[2:03:28] it's then there that that that amnesia
[2:03:32] just got to go and that you've got to
[2:03:34] just remember
[2:03:36] that i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of
[2:03:39] god
[2:03:40] and no devil no giant has got
[2:03:43] any power over me
[2:03:49] so when the devil comes and he kicks you
[2:03:54] what you do you kick him back
[2:03:57] you kick him out
[2:04:01] when he tries to jump on you you jump on
[2:04:04] him harder
[2:04:05] he's under my feet don't allow him
[2:04:12] i think in the brother brother talks
[2:04:14] about it about this brother that had the
[2:04:16] dream
[2:04:16] and how the you know the devil would go
[2:04:18] boo
[2:04:19] and the brother gets smaller and smaller

[2:04:23] and the devil gets bigger and bigger and
[2:04:24] bigger until the brother to come to
[2:04:26] realization
[2:04:27] of who he is and then he started saying
[2:04:31] boo and then he seen that they will
[2:04:33] start going smaller
[2:04:34] and smaller and smaller and smaller i

[2:04:55] be troubled so don't allow
[2:05:01] you it will be true you will go through
[2:05:03] emotions we
[2:05:04] emotional creatures but don't
[2:05:08] allow that to overwhelm you
[2:05:13] or to control your life
[2:05:17] look at yourself today where were you
[2:05:20] a couple of years ago maybe a couple of
[2:05:23] months ago
[2:05:24] maybe a couple of weeks ago where were
[2:05:26] you and where are you today
[2:05:29] the god that has been carrying you then
[2:05:32] is still carrying you today
[2:05:35] hallelujah chicano tabernacle nine years
[2:05:40] last week god
[2:05:43] god started it god carried it
[2:05:48] and here we are today and god is going
[2:05:51] to take it further
[2:05:53] just follow him just allow him
[2:05:56] to have an impact
[2:06:03] can you tell the devil devil today
[2:06:07] i am still standing
[2:06:11] yes the the naysayers and the negative
[2:06:14] talkers said huh
[2:06:16] look at him give him give you a couple
[2:06:18] of days
[2:06:19] yeah john i'm thinking about thinking
[2:06:20] about john how god did something for you
[2:06:22] at the camp
[2:06:23] and the devil and everyone else probably
[2:06:25] thought huh look at john there
[2:06:27] what's going to happen give him a few
[2:06:29] days he's just gonna fall
[2:06:32] but dwan is still here today
[2:06:35] not by his own ability but by the grace
[2:06:38] of god
[2:06:44] and the grace of god is carrying you
[2:06:49] on the clothes of soon the grace of god
[2:06:53] is scaring you i want to close up just
[2:06:57] with this thought
[2:07:01] as we walking
[2:07:04] and we're living a life
[2:07:07] of a victorious christian
[2:07:12] it's so important that we say
[2:07:16] the right thing
[2:07:20] don't be like the 10 negative spies
[2:07:25] all they could just say was negative
[2:07:27] negative
[2:07:29] they said some positive stuff
[2:07:32] but the negativity overrode it
[2:07:36] let's be careful
[2:07:41] what we say it's so important
[2:07:44] and i wanna i'm gonna take you we're
[2:07:47] gonna finish when i wanna take you
[2:07:50] into messages of brother branham how
[2:07:54] and why it is so important
[2:07:59] that we are careful what we say
[2:08:02] death and life is in the power
[2:08:06] of
[2:08:13] man i just love him he came and he he
[2:08:17] he demonstrated
[2:08:20] he demonstrated this word to us
[2:08:24] he showed us that james it is
[2:08:27] possible to love
[2:08:31] this word it's
[2:08:34] possible to hawk above
[2:08:38] circumstances it's
[2:08:40] possible that even though your heart
[2:08:43] wants to feel
[2:08:44] troubled that you can rise above it
[2:08:58] two quotes in my new ministry
[2:09:02] with brandon talks he says he talks
[2:09:04] about banks
[2:09:06] good he says
[2:09:09] and unconsciously now as
[2:09:12] as we're walking and as we're living and
[2:09:15] as we serving god and
[2:09:17] as we're working and as we go into union
[2:09:19] going to school or
[2:09:21] doing our homeschooling or whatever
[2:09:23] we're doing
[2:09:24] let's just be real christians let's just
[2:09:28] say lord
[2:09:29] i want to serve you i want to please you
[2:09:32] i want to talk according to the way you
[2:09:35] want me to speak
[2:09:37] so brother branham says here
[2:09:39] unconsciously
[2:09:41] banks must have said the right thing
[2:09:44] now if you go back to to to um what
[2:09:47] brother brandon talks about
[2:09:48] you know he talks about hattie right and
[2:09:50] we know about it how brother branham
[2:09:52] came with
[2:09:52] with a testimony and how hat you write
[2:09:55] said brother branham
[2:09:56] that is nothing but the truth and she
[2:09:59] said
[2:10:00] the right thing and because she said the
[2:10:02] right thing
[2:10:04] god was pleased and god says now
[2:10:06] whatever you want
[2:10:08] my prophet will speak it
[2:10:12] but now the brain also talks about banks
[2:10:15] and and he says banks unconsciously
[2:10:19] must have said the right thing now what
[2:10:21] really happened was banks and his
[2:10:22] brother
[2:10:23] they were i don't know i think they went
[2:10:24] by the boats i'm not sure exactly where
[2:10:26] but brother brandon tells us that they
[2:10:28] were talking with each other
[2:10:30] now god had done something amazing to
[2:10:32] them and they had experienced
[2:10:34] god and then they started talking to
[2:10:36] each other and said you know what
[2:10:38] maybe we should go to that lady you know
[2:10:40] that lady that looked after us
[2:10:42] and maybe we should go and testify to
[2:10:44] her
[2:10:46] simple right maybe we should just go
[2:10:48] there and testify
[2:10:50] god heard that a simple
[2:10:54] conversation between two brothers
[2:10:57] maybe can i go and testify
[2:11:00] god heard that and brother bannon says
[2:11:04] unconsciously
[2:11:05] banks must have said the right thing and
[2:11:08] then we know what happened but branham
[2:11:10] says
[2:11:10] um and when banks said that
[2:11:14] all of a sudden something struck me
[2:11:17] he said the right thing amen
[2:11:20] and to us it's a simple thing right i
[2:11:23] want to go testify
[2:11:25] but he said the right thing and the holy
[2:11:29] spirit spoke
[2:11:30] out and said thus saith the lord
[2:11:33] you'll find the next few hours there'll
[2:11:35] be a resurrection of a little animal
[2:11:37] and we know what happened the dead fish
[2:11:40] so
[2:11:40] banks was a witness to
[2:11:44] the spoken word spoken to a dead fish
[2:11:48] that came back to life
[2:11:52] all right thing
[2:11:56] say the right
[2:11:59] thing now i want to read you this
[2:12:03] he says now every one of you
[2:12:07] every one of you he says not only the
[2:12:11] ministers
[2:12:12] i know you are ministers here but
[2:12:14] brother branham says
[2:12:15] every one of you from the youngest
[2:12:19] to the oldest he says
[2:12:24] not only the ministers but all of you
[2:12:28] want to pray for these people
[2:12:32] now before i go on
[2:12:36] i i i want to encourage you
[2:12:39] you know look at i look at the the
[2:12:40] believers in this church
[2:12:42] i look at i've got a very strong
[2:12:46] passion for the young ones
[2:12:49] and i want to just encourage you
[2:12:53] don't stop praying
[2:12:57] for your young ones and also
[2:13:00] don't know just i've got my family so
[2:13:03] i'm praying for my family

[2:13:09] let's pray for his family let's pray for
[2:13:12] this family
[2:13:13] let's pray for each other amen
[2:13:16] it's easier all of you
[2:13:19] want to pray for these people
[2:13:22] he says you don't know
[2:13:25] what god might do for you
[2:13:30] while you're praying for somebody else
[2:13:34] [Music]
[2:13:36] i know you're praying church but i want
[2:13:39] to just encourage you
[2:13:41] let's pray let's see more
[2:13:44] more let's pray for each other more
[2:13:46] let's hold each other up
[2:13:49] i was not last week then in taranaki i
[2:13:52] looked at these young people
[2:13:53] man i said what potential
[2:13:57] people that can shake new zealand
[2:14:02] don't stop praying
[2:14:06] he says you don't know what god might do
[2:14:08] for you
[2:14:10] while you're praying for someone else
[2:14:13] what if you will
[2:14:16] say the right thing
[2:14:20] banks would said the right thing
[2:14:23] then some of these things happened at
[2:14:26] the right said
[2:14:27] the right thing something happened
[2:14:30] what if you say the right thing
[2:14:35] imagine we've got you know
[2:14:38] we want out i've got a desire for my
[2:14:41] children
[2:14:42] to be so on fire for god
[2:14:45] i want my kids to grow up and just be
[2:14:47] totally
[2:14:48] sold out to jesus what if i said
[2:14:52] the right thing and god is so pleased
[2:14:56] he says i'm taking sith chloe
[2:15:00] and micah to another level
[2:15:03] man what if you'd
[2:15:06] say the right thing and then he says he
[2:15:09] says
[2:15:10] there's a woman standing here that's so
[2:15:13] sick
[2:15:14] they have to hold up what
[2:15:17] if your prayer yeah
[2:15:28] there's a woman standing here that's so
[2:15:29] sick they have to hold
[2:15:31] up what if your prayer
[2:15:34] would be the right thing just like bank
[2:15:38] said the right thing
[2:15:39] like hattie said the other thing what
[2:15:42] if you'd say the right
[2:15:46] thing and your prayer
[2:15:51] would cause god to come down
[2:15:55] and do something amen
[2:15:59] so it's not about the minister
[2:16:02] it's about you you're praying
[2:16:06] you're sitting in the seat you're
[2:16:08] thinking the right thoughts
[2:16:10] you're focusing on him you're allowing
[2:16:13] him to impact you and you pray the right
[2:16:17] prayer
[2:16:18] where you say the right thing and then
[2:16:21] god is so pleased and he sweeps
[2:16:24] in and he meets
[2:16:27] the needs of people musicians can come
[2:16:32] i've gotten few things but i'm going to
[2:16:34] finish off with this musicians you can
[2:16:35] come
[2:16:37] brother branham it relates he gives a
[2:16:40] testimony
[2:16:42] and i'll close up with this he gives a
[2:16:46] testimony
[2:16:49] he talks about a brother evans
[2:16:57] he says and going out
[2:17:01] so what what should happen was brother
[2:17:02] evans if you don't know
[2:17:05] what happened there brother evans
[2:17:08] vehicle was stolen
[2:17:11] by the evans vehicle was stolen and he
[2:17:14] came to brother branham and
[2:17:16] said brother brandon my vehicle is
[2:17:17] stolen and can be going to pray
[2:17:20] so brother branham goes into prayer
[2:17:24] and he says and going out so in in
[2:17:27] prayer
[2:17:29] he said i seen a young fellow
[2:17:33] wearing a yellow shirt and once been a
[2:17:37] christian
[2:17:39] raised in a christian home and he was in
[2:17:42] brother evans
[2:17:43] car so this young fellow had been a
[2:17:47] christian
[2:17:48] maybe made some wrong decisions ended up
[2:17:51] just
[2:17:51] stealing cars and he stole
[2:17:55] brother evan scott
[2:17:58] and brother branham goes in prayer and
[2:18:01] he prays and then the lord
[2:18:04] shows him this young man
[2:18:08] in brother evans car going down to
[2:18:11] bowling green kentucky
[2:18:13] this is 118 miles below louisville
[2:18:17] and brother branham says and while
[2:18:20] praying
[2:18:21] he says in the spirit
[2:18:25] while praying that's why the branham is
[2:18:28] praying
[2:18:29] and he sees this young man the lord
[2:18:32] shows him the young man driving in the
[2:18:33] car
[2:18:35] and brother branham says and the spirit
[2:18:38] while praying convicted him
[2:18:43] so this young man he's stolen the car
[2:18:46] was a christian experience he probably
[2:18:49] experienced god or experienced church or
[2:18:51] seen
[2:18:52] how god was working with maybe with his
[2:18:54] family with his mom with his dad
[2:18:57] and he steals the squad and he goes
[2:19:00] and with the brand name is praying and
[2:19:02] the lord shows him this young man
[2:19:04] and while but the brandon was praying
[2:19:07] the spirit of god
[2:19:09] convicts this young man driving the car
[2:19:15] and convicts him that he was doing wrong
[2:19:18] he was working for this ring he was
[2:19:21] doing wrong
[2:19:23] and then the spirit the world
[2:19:26] the word holding over him
[2:19:30] in this prayer is by the branham is in
[2:19:32] prayer
[2:19:34] and he's praying for this boy and
[2:19:37] brother branham says the holy spirit
[2:19:38] convicts him
[2:19:40] and the spirit holding over him in this
[2:19:44] prayer
[2:19:45] this young man turns the car
[2:19:48] and he comes back he parks the course
[2:19:51] somewhere
[2:19:53] and he runs away now as i
[2:19:56] i was reading the quotation
[2:20:00] i thought to myself
[2:20:03] what a an awesome god
[2:20:07] we serve
[2:20:12] a guy comes to brother brandon
[2:20:16] and he says my car is stolen
[2:20:20] it just shows how mindful of you and i
[2:20:22] god is
[2:20:24] my call is stolen and brother branham
[2:20:28] goes into prayer
[2:20:31] and god works in the heart of the thief
[2:20:36] turns him around comes back now
[2:20:39] brother branham didn't know the thief
[2:20:42] brother evans
[2:20:43] didn't know the thief god knew the thief
[2:20:47] and god worked in that thief's heart
[2:20:50] turned him back and i thought to myself
[2:20:54] if my god can do that
[2:20:58] for a stolen vehicle
[2:21:03] a stolen car
[2:21:07] what can he do for our loved ones
[2:21:13] what can we do for our children
[2:21:18] you know what i've noticed in the in the
[2:21:21] i don't know why
[2:21:24] but i've started to discover and i said
[2:21:26] lord i don't want that to happen to my
[2:21:28] children
[2:21:30] i discover that i didn't know what
[2:21:33] happened when i was younger we
[2:21:35] we in the church we grew up to a certain
[2:21:37] age we
[2:21:38] start thinking for ourselves obviously
[2:21:40] and then we decide we don't want
[2:21:42] and we go away and we just don't come to
[2:21:45] church anymore and
[2:21:47] we allow our parents to struggle
[2:21:52] but i want to just encourage us this
[2:21:54] morning each one of us
[2:21:58] you know maybe of someone that's out
[2:22:00] there
[2:22:02] maybe you know if someone is just
[2:22:06] struggling
[2:22:08] let's pray for them
[2:22:12] the same god that could convict
[2:22:17] a thief driving a car
[2:22:20] and allow that thief to bring that call
[2:22:24] back
[2:22:26] the same god is able
[2:22:32] to work in the hearts of our children

[2:40:04] for something just for the sake of it
[2:40:05] but
[2:40:06] there's god works at both ends so
[2:40:08] there's burden for people
[2:40:10] there's a people that that need need the
[2:40:13] lord they need the
[2:40:14] fullness of the word they need
[2:40:15] deliverance and to walk in the you know

[2:40:23] pillar and asset and amen it's been a
[2:40:25] real joy to have you here
