[1:45] God bless you saints. Welcome to the

[2:12] want to come and pray, Lord, that um any
[2:15] spirit that's here, Lord Jesus, that's

[17:26] Oh, let the word of God impart.
[17:33] Hallelujah.
[17:35] Amen. I trust that's everyone's
[17:36] heartfelt desire tonight. The word of
[17:39] God would change us. Amen. Mold us and
[17:41] shape us. Amen. Thanks. Thank you, Josh.
[17:44] Thank you, musicians. Appreciate the
[17:45] atmosphere. Amen. God bless you all
[17:47] tonight. Good to have everyone here.
[17:48] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's um let's go
[17:51] in the scripture to um Genesis chapter 1
[17:56] and um just going to read a couple of
[17:58] verses here. Then we're going to go to
[17:59] First Kings 19 and um
[18:04] yeah, we're just going to read this
[18:05] here.
[18:08] I mean, so Genesis 1 and 26-28.
[18:18] Amen. And it says, "And God said, let us
[18:22] make man in our image, after our
[18:24] likeness, and let them have dominion
[18:26] over the fish of the sea, over the fowl
[18:28] of the air, and over the cattle, and
[18:30] over all the earth, and over every
[18:32] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[18:34] earth." So God created man in his own
[18:36] image, in the image of God created he
[18:38] him, male and female created he them.
[18:41] And God blessed them. And God said unto
[18:43] them, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and
[18:45] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[18:47] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[18:49] over the fowl of the air, and over every
[18:51] living thing that moveth upon the
[18:53] earth." Amen. Then we're going to go to
[18:56] First Kings, just a bit of a
[18:58] uh I trust the context. I trust this all
[19:00] tied together. Uh so first Kings 19,
[19:04] going to read verses 19 to 21.
[19:13] Amen. We're all there. So, I'm a quick
[19:14] off the quick out of the blocks. Amen.
[19:18] So, yeah. First Kings 19 and 19-21 says
[19:20] this says, "So he departed uh then found
[19:24] Elisha the son of Chafat who was plowing
[19:27] with 12 yolk of oxen before him. And he
[19:30] with the 12th and Elijah passed by him
[19:32] and cast his mantle upon him. And he
[19:34] left the oxen and ran after Elijah and
[19:36] said, "Let me, I pray thee, kiss my
[19:38] father and my mother, and then I'll
[19:39] follow thee." And he said unto him, "Go
[19:41] back again. What I what for what have I
[19:45] done to thee?" And he returned back from
[19:47] him and took a yoke of oxen and slew
[19:50] them and boiled their flesh with the
[19:51] instruments of the oxen, and gave unto
[19:53] the people, and they did eat. Then he
[19:55] arose, and went after Elijah, and
[19:57] ministered unto him. Amen. Let's uh
[20:00] let's bow our heads in a word of prayer
[20:02] tonight. If you have a need, just want
[20:03] to slip your hand up, say, "Lord,
[20:05] remember me in this time." Amen. Let's
[20:06] pray. Gracious Father, you see that
[20:09] hands have been raised up all around the
[20:10] building, Lord. No doubt those who are
[20:12] streaming as well, Father. Lord, we lift
[20:14] our hands. We have needs, Lord. We have
[20:16] burdens. We got things in our lives,
[20:18] Lord, that we need you to come and
[20:20] minister to to change. Father, you see
[20:22] every uh you know the reason why we've
[20:24] lifted up our hands. I pray, dear God,
[20:26] you come and your great grace touch each
[20:28] of our lives, Lord. Not just here, but
[20:30] those who are watching by the way of
[20:32] YouTube. May you be our portion this
[20:34] night. Lord, we just desire more than
[20:36] anything that your word would change us
[20:38] from glory to glory. We love you, Lord.
[20:40] We thank you. You first loved us and
[20:41] died for us on Calvar's tree. Thank you
[20:43] for your allsufficient sacrifice. We
[20:46] love you, Lord. I just pray you'd touch
[20:47] every life, Lord. Those, Lord, who are
[20:49] sick and body as well, who are not here,
[20:51] be their portion, too. Father, we lift
[20:52] them into your presence by prayer,
[20:54] committing the service into your hands,
[20:56] Lord. Asking you'd cover us in your
[20:57] blood. May your preeminence take
[20:59] complete control, Lord, for your glory
[21:01] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[21:04] bless you, friends. You can have your
[21:05] seats uh tonight. I was I was quite
[21:09] struck. I really enjoyed Brother Isaac's
[21:11] um service last well, two Sundays ago,
[21:14] and um it really struck me how how so um
[21:20] well, I'll just put this up then we'll
[21:21] come back to what we're talking about.
[21:22] But you know there's um there was
[21:24] recently uh in in China there was this
[21:26] humanoid uh robot games and some people
[21:30] have said humans keep building robots
[21:32] that are shaped like us. What's the
[21:33] point? And to me as brother Isaac was
[21:36] bringing out about artificial
[21:37] intelligence and all the effort and
[21:40] energy that man has put into building
[21:42] these things and we know the wisdom of
[21:44] man is fullness in the sight of God. But
[21:46] you see it's it's it's within man to
[21:49] build something in his image. He can't
[21:52] help it. He's he's all of technology,
[21:54] the apex really of all of our
[21:56] technological advancements will be a
[21:59] robot or something that's made in the
[22:01] image of man because God made man in
[22:04] God's image. And so because we are made
[22:06] in the image of God, then we have a
[22:08] burden along to make something like us.
[22:11] You see? And so, so that's why, you
[22:13] know, because, you know, people will
[22:15] argue, what's the point in making a
[22:16] robot that's like a man? It's not the
[22:18] best shape. It's not the best structure
[22:19] to move things, carry things, not the
[22:21] most stable, not the fastest, but yet it
[22:24] because it's it's it's within man to
[22:26] drive man to make something like him. He
[22:28] can't help it. He's going to put all of
[22:30] his technology towards it. We can see
[22:32] it, you know. But you see, it's because
[22:34] we were made in the image of God. And
[22:36] because we're made in the image of God,
[22:38] we want to make something like us that
[22:40] we can have fellowship with, that we can
[22:41] commune with, that we can fall in love
[22:44] with, we can have a relationship with.
[22:46] That's why, you know, nowadays there's,
[22:48] I think brother Isaac brought it up,
[22:49] but, you know, there's there's a avatars
[22:52] that people want to marry. You know,
[22:53] these chat bots they fall in love with.
[22:55] They build relationships. And, you know,
[22:57] it's because God made someone to love.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; And so, because we're made in the image
[23:02] of God, we want to make something to
[23:04] love. And this is why people have made
[23:06] this technology because they want
[23:07] something to love.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; Because we're made in the image of God.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Man can't help it.
[23:14] The thing is though, God doesn't want us
[23:17] to be in the image of man. He wants us
[23:20] to be in the image of fallen man. He
[23:22] wants us to be in his image. Now, we
[23:25] understand from Genesis chapter 1 that
[23:27] when God created man in his own image,
[23:29] that image that he first made man in was
[23:31] a spirit man. He created him as as Jesus
[23:34] would say to the woman at the well, God
[23:36] is a spirit and they worship him must
[23:38] worship him in spirit and in truth. So
[23:40] when God made man, male and female, he
[23:43] made him as a as a spirit man. And then
[23:45] as we come down to Genesis chapter 2, it
[23:48] says, "And the Lord God formed man out
[23:50] of the dust of the earth." Now this word
[23:52] formed is not the same as create. Create
[23:54] is you you make something out of
[23:56] nothing. But to form something is like
[23:58] you take some clay. Who's ever done that
[24:00] in art? You at school. You take a lump
[24:02] of clay and you make something, right?
[24:03] You make a vase or a cup and normally
[24:05] blows up in the kiln if you ever get
[24:07] that far. But you see, you form that
[24:09] thing out of clay. And so God formed the
[24:12] physical body of man out of the dust of
[24:14] the earth. And then he put that spirit
[24:16] man within the natural man. I put it
[24:18] that way. And so now, but then of course
[24:21] the full expression of the image of God
[24:23] then was when Eve came out of Adam,
[24:26] right? Because what did uh because when
[24:28] when when man became material, what was
[24:32] he? One. He wasn't three people. He was
[24:35] one person
[24:36] &gt;&gt; with the woman inside him and then she
[24:38] became expressed and that's the image of
[24:40] God. Man and woman together united.
[24:43] Beautiful.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when So that's why the trinity
[24:48] doesn't work from the very beginning.
[24:49] Okay. What was the what did he make? He
[24:51] made one.
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Didn't make three. Okay. And then now
[24:55] when when um God would look down and see
[24:58] Adam in this body of flesh before Eve
[25:00] was taken out of him uh you know God
[25:03] would God would look at Adam this the
[25:05] apex of his creation and say it's not
[25:07] good that he's dwelling alone. You know,
[25:09] God when he made everything else, he
[25:10] said it's good or very good. But when he
[25:12] saw man alone, he says it's not good
[25:15] because he was he was signifying uh
[25:17] Adam's loneliness was was was signifying
[25:20] his own loneliness, if I put it that
[25:22] way. Because God was dwelling alone with
[25:24] his thoughts, but he didn't want to just
[25:25] dwell alone with his thoughts. He wanted
[25:27] to dwell with his family. He wanted them
[25:29] to be expressed. He wanted them to be
[25:31] around him, to have a relationship with
[25:32] him. And then so what happened was God
[25:34] would cause a deep sleep to to to come
[25:38] over Adam and he you know took the rib
[25:40] out and and uh medical science has
[25:42] proven that you can take a rib out a
[25:43] certain way and it'll grow back cuz you
[25:46] know it used to stumble people when when
[25:47] when you count the number of ribs on a
[25:49] man it's the same on both sides, right?
[25:52] There's not one missing. And well the
[25:54] reason is is if you cut a rib out a
[25:55] certain way it grows back. One of the
[25:57] few bones that'll do it. God's a good
[25:59] surgeon.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; He doesn't do a hack job. Okay, he
[26:02] doesn't leave a big scar. He does a
[26:04] perfect job. But the thing is, he didn't
[26:05] just take out the physical rib. He
[26:07] actually took out the feminist spirit
[26:08] out of Adam and and and put that put
[26:10] that in what we call Eve, you know, the
[26:12] woman. And so now there the two of them
[26:14] were God's perfect masterpiece.
[26:17] And brother Bram would say that that
[26:19] that after after he made this
[26:20] masterpiece that the that the devil came
[26:23] in and and and slithered under the walls
[26:25] of of the Garden of Eden and broke that
[26:27] masterpiece. And so now what happened?
[26:30] But then of course, God being the master
[26:32] sculptor and the victorious one wouldn't
[26:34] just leave his masterpiece sitting there
[26:36] in ruin in sin, you know, broken up. He
[26:39] says, "I'm going to rebuild this and
[26:41] it's going to be better than it ever was
[26:42] in the beginning." Okay? Because
[26:44] remember, we're built in a condition
[26:45] that we can't fall, right? Our souls are
[26:48] sealed to the day of our redemption.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We cannot fall. We're actually in
[26:52] a position. You say, "Well, I'm in this
[26:53] body of flesh." Yes, but you're in a bit
[26:55] better state than Eve and Adam were in
[26:57] the garden because you can't fall.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. They fell. They fell in paradise.
[27:04] We stand in Satan's Eden by the grace of
[27:06] God.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; So now Adam and Eve, there they are in
[27:11] the garden. They're fallen and and then
[27:12] and then of course God wanted wanted man
[27:16] to reproduce himself as more gods upon
[27:19] the earth,
[27:20] &gt;&gt; right? But then now in Genesis 5 when
[27:23] when it picks up the generation, it says
[27:24] this is the book of the generations of
[27:26] Adam. So basically what you're going to
[27:28] read now is the family tree of Adam and
[27:30] Eve. This is it right in the day that
[27:33] God created him in the likeness of God
[27:35] made he him. Male and female created he
[27:38] them and blessed them and called their
[27:39] name Adam in the day that they were
[27:40] created. And Adam lived 130 years and
[27:43] begat a son in his own likeness after
[27:46] his image and called his name Seth. So
[27:49] notice it's it doesn't say Adam lived
[27:51] 130 years and begat a son in the image
[27:54] of God. No, in Adam's own fallen image,
[27:58] he be to produce. He was Seth was the
[28:00] son of God. We'll meet him one day.
[28:02] It'll be wonderful.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Right? But you see, he he was being made
[28:06] in Adam's fallen image, not in not in
[28:09] the image that Adam was in before the
[28:11] fall. Are you following me right now?
[28:12] Right? So he begins to reproduce
[28:14] himself. And it's not as sons of God,
[28:16] you know, that without sin, perfect,
[28:18] made in the image of the word. It's
[28:20] fallen Adam reproducing himself. And
[28:23] this is the thing we must be very
[28:24] careful of is we do not want to
[28:26] reproduce ourselves
[28:29] people
[28:30] &gt;&gt; only. We desire that our children would
[28:33] know the Lord,
[28:35] &gt;&gt; right? Because when God comes into their
[28:37] lives and transforms them, it's no
[28:39] longer our natural lineage living
[28:40] through. Sure, on the outside it is.
[28:42] their characteristics, their looks and
[28:43] everything are you see mom and dad in
[28:45] them. Praise the Lord or or not. Okay,
[28:48] that's fine, you know. But but but the
[28:51] inner man, the eternal man, right? He is
[28:54] now made in the image of God. Praise the
[28:57] Lord. I'm just going to going to walk
[28:58] through this. We're just going to go for
[28:59] a stroll. Okay. Amen. So, so the thing
[29:01] is we don't want to make people in the
[29:03] image of ourselves. So, for example, I
[29:05] would hate it that when we get to the
[29:07] end of the road and and we're well, you
[29:09] know, we come to the end of all things
[29:12] and we realize actually all I've done is
[29:14] reproduced spiritually myself and
[29:16] people.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; That would be the worst thing
[29:19] &gt;&gt; any any minister would come to that
[29:21] realization that actually the
[29:23] congregation has just taken on the
[29:24] pastor's spirit
[29:26] &gt;&gt; because our desire is of course my
[29:28] desire is that you receive the Holy
[29:30] Ghost,
[29:31] &gt;&gt; right? that is that that God God
[29:33] reproduces himself that way. Amen. It's
[29:36] not little Benjamins running around.
[29:38] We've got one of them. One's enough.
[29:40] Okay. But then he can't stay like that.
[29:42] He's got to have his own experience with
[29:43] the Lord. There's not fallen glowin
[29:46] genes that are expressing themselves.
[29:47] Actually, God comes into him and begins
[29:50] to express himself.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because we realize now
[29:55] that we have been we know that all
[29:57] things work together for good to them
[29:58] that love God to them who are called
[30:00] according to his purpose for whom he did
[30:02] for know he also did predestinate to be
[30:05] conformed to the image of his son that
[30:08] he might be the firstborn among many
[30:10] brethren. Moreover, whom he did
[30:12] predestinate them he also called and
[30:14] whom he called them he also justified
[30:16] and whom he justified them he also
[30:19] glorified. I like that. Amen. But you
[30:21] see we've been for ordained. We've been
[30:23] predestinated to be conformed to the
[30:24] image of his son. So we've been we've
[30:27] been predestinated to be conformed to
[30:28] the image of the word as God wanted us
[30:31] to be in the beginning. You realize if
[30:33] there was never a fall, God just would
[30:34] have Adam would have just spoken us
[30:36] forth
[30:37] &gt;&gt; and we would have been in a perfect
[30:38] image how God wants us to be in the end
[30:41] fully mature made in his image. That's
[30:44] how it was going to be, right? But God
[30:46] allowed it to come a secondary way. So,
[30:49] we're born in sin, shaped iniquity, come
[30:50] to the world speaking lies, but yet
[30:52] there's on the inside of the inside of
[30:54] us is that God gene that wants to live,
[30:56] &gt;&gt; that's crying out for expression. That's
[30:58] why if there's a hunger in your heart
[30:59] for God, God put that in there before
[31:01] the foundation of the world. Amen. That
[31:04] because God wanted not just your natural
[31:06] self to grow and mature, he wants
[31:08] himself to grow and mature and express
[31:10] himself through you.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've been ordained to be
[31:17] conformed to the image of his son, made
[31:19] in the image of God. Amen. You know,
[31:23] when we receive the Holy Ghost, it makes
[31:25] people, it does the same thing through
[31:27] anyone. Doesn't matter about culture,
[31:30] language, background. When people meet
[31:32] the Lord, it transforms them,
[31:35] &gt;&gt; right? Doesn't make us all the same
[31:36] personality, but it changes our lives
[31:39] that we love the same word that he comes
[31:41] and lives through out of our lives.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So he says now he
[31:46] says I'm a mystery. I go over the land
[31:48] where people there that don't even know
[31:50] which is right and left hand. They stand
[31:52] there. You know what they do when they
[31:53] receive the Holy Ghost? The same thing
[31:55] you do the same thing. Amen. Why? Cuz
[31:57] the life is now changed. The life that
[31:59] they were meant to have in the beginning
[32:00] has actually come in and is now living
[32:02] itself out. What a glorious thing. I
[32:04] mean, aren't you glad that the same God
[32:06] that came down the day of Pentecost
[32:07] lives in you? makes you live the same
[32:10] kind of life, the same faith. Amen. That
[32:12] they had, you have by the grace of God.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, because that's why a new
[32:18] birth is a a new life coming in. There's
[32:20] a dormant something was dormant on the
[32:22] inside of you, that gene seed of God.
[32:24] But then God in God's season when the
[32:25] Holy Ghost comes and quickens the word
[32:27] to your to your soul. Amen. You're born
[32:29] again. There's a creation that takes
[32:31] place if I put it that way. There's a
[32:33] new life comes in. I mean, the life you
[32:35] were meant to have in the beginning,
[32:36] right, is now within you. And now the
[32:38] Lord himself begins to live his life
[32:40] out. Amen. Praise the Lord. See, the
[32:43] thing is, you know, people talk about
[32:45] there was a blood moon. I got up to see
[32:47] it, but I saw clouds. I don't know if
[32:48] anyone saw it a couple of mornings ago.
[32:50] And you know, the signs in the heavens
[32:52] and you know, Israel's now bombed uh
[32:54] Hamas and uh Doha and all these things
[32:56] are going on. But, you know, those signs
[32:59] aren't really the signs. There's a true
[33:01] sign overlooked and it's walking around
[33:04] on two feet.
[33:06] Amen. The true sign in this day is not
[33:09] even brother Brandham anymore. It's now
[33:11] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's now the word made flesh in
[33:15] you and I.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the sign that the world is
[33:19] actually looking at. They don't
[33:20] understand what they're looking at. Even
[33:22] ourselves, we look in the mirror and we
[33:24] wrestle with what we are or who we are,
[33:26] right? This natural guy. This this but
[33:28] but on the inside there's something very
[33:30] different. Amen. There's God. Okay.
[33:31] Okay. And then so so because what God is
[33:34] going to prove the full power of Calvary
[33:36] through a people and he's going to take
[33:38] us home.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is so you are the last sign
[33:43] to this world before God turns to the
[33:45] Jews. Lord
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:49] But now
[33:51] see even so
[33:55] as we read about with um Elisha,
[33:59] Elijah when he was there on Mount Carmel
[34:01] or no sorry not mount Carmel he went
[34:03] down um he went down to Mount Horeb I
[34:06] think it was you know after he had had
[34:07] the great showdown with the priest of
[34:09] Baal and so on and then God speaking to
[34:11] him there in the cave and asking him in
[34:13] this previous uh verses saying what are
[34:16] you doing here Elijah what's going on.
[34:18] Then then then Elijah begins to tell him
[34:21] about, you know, he's he's the only one
[34:23] left alive and all these things and
[34:25] troubles that's going on. But then God o
[34:27] God in his grace opens opens the lamb's
[34:30] book of life to to Elijah and he goes
[34:34] down to the margin, goes to the page
[34:35] where Elisha's name is written and says,
[34:38] "Look, Elijah, this ministry is going to
[34:40] continue on. It's not you that's going
[34:43] to continue it on forever. But there's
[34:44] going to be a transition period that
[34:46] takes place because you are assigned to
[34:48] Israel because your name I think means
[34:50] my God is Jehovah. And God proved his
[34:53] word through Elijah on Mount Carmel and
[34:55] many other things he did. But you see
[34:57] now here he comes and he's, you know,
[34:58] he's down. He's in this cave. He's
[35:00] downcast and he's wondering what's going
[35:01] on and what the future holds for him.
[35:04] But then Elijah is told, you're going to
[35:06] go anoint Elisha to be prophet in thy
[35:09] room. and that and that in my room means
[35:11] the one he's going to be the prophet
[35:12] after you that this ministry is going to
[35:15] continue on through Elisha. Now, we
[35:17] understand that brother Brown would
[35:18] teach this that that that Elijah of
[35:20] course is is Christ and then Elisha is
[35:23] the is the bride or the church of Jesus
[35:26] Christ following after him. Now, we
[35:29] understand that in order for someone to
[35:32] come to adoption, our we and our
[35:34] humanity can't do it, right? for for for
[35:38] like a man to come to manhood uh
[35:41] spiritually it takes the Lord to do it
[35:44] or a sister your woman to come to
[35:46] adoption as well because brother when he
[35:48] preaches uh leadership he says you know
[35:50] the first thing you do is you hold your
[35:52] your mother's hand you take your first
[35:54] little steps and she leads you and then
[35:56] and then she passes you on to the school
[35:58] teacher and then the school teacher
[35:59] leads you and then and then after the
[36:01] school teacher becomes your dad and then
[36:03] you know the pastor and so on but they
[36:05] come so what he's saying is that as a as
[36:07] a person is growing or maturing this
[36:09] human leadership is so involved and we
[36:11] know through our lives there's human
[36:13] leadership but the main one in certain
[36:15] forms of development uh the mother the
[36:17] father uh school teachers and so on
[36:20] right but then he says after the
[36:22] minister gets a hold of you then he says
[36:24] now who's going to lead you then because
[36:26] the thing is a church as a woman cannot
[36:28] bring a man to manhood right you know we
[36:31] cannot bring any of you to adoption it
[36:34] takes the word and the word alone known
[36:36] to mold and shape you. Amen. Into into
[36:39] the image of God. Now Elisha could never
[36:42] come to his position that God foreformed
[36:44] him to have by plowing oxen with m you
[36:47] for mom and dad. He was good at what he
[36:49] did. He was plowing straight rows. It
[36:51] would have been very difficult all those
[36:52] oxen keeping them straight. And I'd hate
[36:54] to try and do that, you know, but but he
[36:56] was skilled. He knew what he was doing.
[36:57] But you see him in that position could
[36:59] never bring him to adoption to a full
[37:02] manifestation of being a son of God. It
[37:05] took a prophet to come along, I mean,
[37:08] and throw his mantle over the shoulders
[37:10] of Elisha. And I thought, isn't that
[37:12] interesting that as soon as, you know,
[37:14] you know, um, Elisha asked him, um, you
[37:17] know, let me, um, wait, let's just find
[37:19] the scriptures, go back up to it. He
[37:22] says, you know, uh, you know, he left
[37:24] the ox and ran after Elijah, said, "Let
[37:26] me, I pray thee, kiss my father and thy
[37:28] mothers." Verse 20, "And I will follow
[37:30] thee." And Elijah said unto him, "Go
[37:32] back again, for what have I done to
[37:35] thee?" See, Elijah has been constantly
[37:36] telling Elisha, "Go back." And we'll
[37:39] come into that when, you know, before
[37:40] Elijah's taken up in the chariot, he's
[37:42] always saying, "Stay here. Go back." But
[37:44] he knew what was in Elisha's heart. And
[37:47] Elisha, you know, the bride of Jesus
[37:49] Christ, we want all of God, right? We're
[37:51] not listening to anything saying, "Stay
[37:53] here. Don't come any further." There's
[37:55] something in us says, "Lord, even if you
[37:57] tell me to stop, I'm going to keep
[37:58] walking with you." Amen. You can't stop
[38:01] me.
[38:02] Praise the Lord. Amen. So that So, so
[38:05] here is Elisha. I'm just going I just
[38:06] want to go back to this picture here.
[38:08] So, so here is Elisha and Elijah throws
[38:11] the mantle over him and he doesn't know
[38:13] that he's been predestinated to take
[38:15] Elijah's place after Elijah is gone. And
[38:18] so now we have come now if we come down
[38:20] to this day, we've had an Elijah in this
[38:22] day. Amen. Brother Ron's ministry, he
[38:23] was the prophet Elijah to come before
[38:25] the great and dreadful day of the Lord
[38:26] to turn our hearts back to the original
[38:28] faith of the fathers. Right? and he's
[38:29] done that. He's gone off the scene.
[38:32] Okay. The mantle that he carried of the
[38:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost, of Christ
[38:36] living in his life, that mantle has been
[38:38] placed upon a per people. You say,
[38:41] "Well, I wasn't there in his ministry."
[38:43] Well, it's not physically being in his
[38:44] meetings that mattered. It's when you
[38:46] hear the voice behind the voice. When
[38:48] you hear that word that's spoken, it's
[38:50] more than hearing Brother Bram's voice.
[38:52] You hear God anointing that word. You
[38:54] hear the voice behind the voice. What's
[38:56] that? God's throwing his mantle over
[38:58] you. of his word because he's calling
[39:00] you for a job that you're already
[39:02] predestinated to do. Amen. And then so
[39:04] now God God begins to call us that way.
[39:06] And then what h but what happens now is
[39:09] there has to we have to go through a
[39:11] molding process to fit the robe to fit
[39:14] the anointing. Amen. Now we know it took
[39:17] Elisha 10 years to get there but it
[39:19] doesn't have to take you 10 years. It
[39:21] can be 30 seconds. You give a full
[39:23] surrender to the Lord and the Lord can
[39:24] mold you and shape you. Amen. to fit
[39:26] that robe
[39:27] &gt;&gt; for the ministry. Amen. Because we know
[39:29] that the book of Revelation says that
[39:31] we're instructed as being John as a
[39:33] symbol of you and I to take the book and
[39:35] eat the book. Then now must prophesy
[39:37] again before many kindreds, tongues, and
[39:39] nations. Right? So that's the ministry
[39:40] of the bride in this end time is
[39:42] Revelations 10:8-11. That's your job.
[39:45] That's what you're called to do. Amen.
[39:46] Live out that to speak under inspiration
[39:49] what's already been given.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that so so there he is. He go
[39:54] he throws his mantle over Elijah. Then
[39:56] Elisha begins to follow him as as the
[39:59] church follows Christ.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now notice in Elijah there, he
[40:04] threw his robe on him and and and and
[40:06] tried it on him." In other words, Elijah
[40:08] the prophet who had the mantle of God on
[40:10] his shoulders. He came down laid it
[40:11] across Elisha the farmer to see if it
[40:13] would fit him. And it had taken about 10
[40:15] years to get altered to fit that mantle.
[40:17] You know, God usually puts us in the
[40:19] shop and trims us up. Now, he didn't
[40:22] alter his robe to fit Elisha. He ordered
[40:24] Elisha to fit the robe. And that's what
[40:26] he does today. He alters us to fit the
[40:29] robe, not the robe to fit us. Sometimes
[40:31] we want to make the robe fit us. But we
[40:33] can't do that. We've got to let uh we've
[40:36] got to let be altered yourself for the
[40:38] robe. It's God's robe. And he made it
[40:40] perfect. He has to bring us into that
[40:42] realm to make the robe fit us. Yes. Like
[40:46] brother Bram says, these great deserts,
[40:48] deserts of experience where men are
[40:51] molded into saints. He says, "I'm so how
[40:53] thankful we are for these these things,
[40:55] Lord, these great deserts of experience
[40:58] where we're molded and shaped to fit the
[41:00] anointing, to fit the word." Remember,
[41:03] we don't want to change the word to
[41:04] match our experience. We want to be
[41:07] changed that our experience matches the
[41:09] word.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And then now there came
[41:14] a time when when um Elijah Elijah knew
[41:19] that he was going to be taken up in the
[41:20] whirlwind. And then this is when he
[41:22] would say to he would say to Elisha
[41:25] repeatedly, "Stay here." And so they
[41:28] they started off in Gilgal. Now the
[41:30] journey that they took is the same
[41:32] journey that the bride of Jesus Christ
[41:34] takes. They started in Gilgal. Now
[41:36] Gilgal is significant because when
[41:37] Joshua brought the children of Israel
[41:39] over Jordan, this is where they
[41:41] circumcised the people again where the
[41:43] reproach of slavery was taken off them
[41:45] was in Gilgal. Amen. And Gilgal
[41:47] represents justification. When you give
[41:49] your life to the Lord, you're justified
[41:50] by faith. That the reproach of being a
[41:53] slave to the world is struck off.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the shame, the guilt, the hurt,
[41:58] the pain, the regret that is struck off
[42:00] in Gilgal. It's a mighty place to be.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; You remember being there? It's a great
[42:05] place to be. Amen. When you realize
[42:07] Jesus died for me. Amen. It's more than
[42:09] a story. It's reality. Amen. He changed
[42:12] my life. Amen. He really died. He really
[42:14] took my sins far away. That's what's
[42:16] that. That's being a Gilgal.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; But you see, we don't want to stay in
[42:20] Gilgal because there's a robe that we
[42:23] must wear. Now, I'm not now I'm looking
[42:25] at people who are wearing the robe.
[42:26] Okay? I just want you to realize this is
[42:28] your journey that God is every day has
[42:30] been significant in God's economy in
[42:32] your life. I mean, every day God's been
[42:34] molding, shaping, speaking to you
[42:37] through everyday life. Amen. It's
[42:39] through everyday routines that God deals
[42:41] with us, molds us, shapes us, changes
[42:43] us. Praise God for everyday life.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then, so we come to Gilgal.
[42:48] That's that place of, you know,
[42:49] justification. And then Elijah said unto
[42:52] Elisha, "Tarry here, I pray thee, for
[42:54] the Lord has sent me to Bethl." And
[42:55] Elisha said unto him, "As the Lord
[42:57] liveth, and as my soul liveth, I will
[42:59] not leave thee." So they went down to
[43:00] Bethl. So Elisha is determined. I'm
[43:03] going to stay with Elijah. And the bride
[43:05] of Jesus Christ, I'm sure this is our
[43:06] heart as Lord. I want to stay where you
[43:08] are.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave you, Lord. I want
[43:10] to, you know, I don't want to wander off
[43:12] of my own ideas. I want to stay with
[43:14] your word completely.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he comes down to Bethlehem.
[43:18] Then he comes to the, you know, there
[43:19] and, you know, there's the sons of the
[43:21] prophets there. And it's amazing how,
[43:24] you know, through this through this
[43:25] whole story that there's that there's
[43:27] people that will, you know, there's sons
[43:29] of prophets. says those who are made in
[43:31] the image of a prophet and they're
[43:33] telling him what's about to happen. It's
[43:36] all very well for people to know events,
[43:38] but I'd rather be in Elisha's shoes than
[43:41] just know what what's going to happen,
[43:43] &gt;&gt; right? Because Elisha is part of the
[43:45] ministry of Elijah, right? The sons of
[43:47] the prophets are just trying to tell
[43:48] them this is going to happen. This is
[43:50] going to happen. You know, been caught
[43:51] up. You know, it's all very well to to
[43:54] know what's going on in the world,
[43:56] &gt;&gt; but we need to know him. We need to know
[43:59] Christ. And we need to be walking in his
[44:01] word. That's the main thing. Okay. And
[44:03] then so Elisha is told by them, you
[44:05] know, your master is going to be taken
[44:07] from thee. And he says, you know, uh,
[44:09] you know, I know these things, you know,
[44:11] yeah, I know it. Hold your peace. And
[44:13] then, and then Elijah tries to leave him
[44:14] there at Bethl, you know, which speaks
[44:16] of like, uh, sanctification, cleansing
[44:19] of worldly habits. God cleanses our
[44:21] spirit. And it's a wonderful place to be
[44:23] is Bethl. Bethl is where Jacob had the
[44:26] dream of the ladder, the angels going up
[44:28] and down. Incredible place. Visions of
[44:31] heaven, angels ascending and descending.
[44:34] I mean, the Lord on the top of the
[44:35] ladder, all these incredible things
[44:37] going on, you know, but but you can't
[44:39] just stay there in sanctification. We
[44:42] got to keep going on. Then finally, he
[44:44] comes to Jericho
[44:46] and he comes to Jordan.
[44:48] And Elijah wants him to stay in these
[44:52] places. And even there when he comes to
[44:54] Jericho, Elisha is told, you know, that
[44:56] don't you know the Lord will take away
[44:58] your master from thy head today? He
[45:00] answered, "Yay, I know it, but hold your
[45:02] peace." And Elijah said to him, "Tarry,
[45:04] I pray thee here, for the Lord has sent
[45:05] me to Jordan." He said, "As the Lord
[45:07] liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I'll not
[45:09] leave thee." And the two went on. See,
[45:11] this is this is a place that many people
[45:14] we must cross Jordan. We must have a
[45:17] death to self. We must not just stay at
[45:19] Gilgal or Bethl or Jericho. the sons of
[45:23] the prophets, we must cross Jordan
[45:25] because there's a mantle for us to use.
[45:28] Not just to wear, but to use. Amen. That
[45:30] God and now I'm not saying we're not in
[45:32] this position, but you know, we can't
[45:34] just stay in just a justified state or a
[45:37] sanctified state. Those are incredible
[45:38] ways to be, but we need to cross Jordan
[45:41] because God wants to take us into the
[45:43] his image. And the only way he takes us
[45:46] into his image is when the word himself
[45:48] comes and lives on the inside of the
[45:49] inside of us. Amen. Because even Elijah
[45:52] was not interested in Elisha becoming a
[45:55] little Elijah.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; He wasn't interested in that. He wanted
[45:58] Elisha to know the same God he knew.
[46:01] Amen. Cuz why? He was a he was he was
[46:03] called. He called Elisha to be prophet
[46:06] in his room after he left. So the same
[46:09] inspiration, the same Holy Ghost
[46:11] leadership, the same word living would
[46:13] be in Elisha was like it was in Elijah.
[46:16] I mean God did not want Elisha to walk
[46:18] around with Elijah's testimonies only.
[46:20] Amen.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, he God doesn't want us just to
[46:23] walk around with brother Bram's
[46:24] testimonies only. He wants us to have
[46:26] our own testimony. I mean, he wants us
[46:28] to have the own living God experiences
[46:30] ourselves where the word comes alive to
[46:33] us. Amen. It's no good walking around
[46:35] with what brother did. You know, those
[46:37] things are all very good. We should talk
[46:38] about those things. But if God is only
[46:40] alive to you back there, it doesn't do
[46:42] you any good. I say you're just a son of
[46:44] the prophet watching what's unfolded,
[46:46] what's going on. But we're called to be
[46:47] Elisha. I mean, we're the same. where
[46:50] the God of the prophet comes and lives
[46:51] in you and I. Amen. And does the
[46:53] supernatural. Amen. Proves his word. And
[46:55] then so Elijah took his mantle, wrapped
[46:58] it together, and he smoked the waters
[46:59] that divided hither and thither. So the
[47:01] two went over on dry ground.
[47:05] So now the word has led Elisha to this
[47:07] place where he's going to cross. He's
[47:08] going to have a true death to self. He's
[47:10] going to die out and cross the river
[47:12] Jordan. Amen. And then so here he is.
[47:14] He's, you know, I just, you know, I just
[47:15] like the angle of this picture. And you
[47:16] see, you know, Elisha in the back. He's
[47:18] watching Elijah do something that only
[47:21] Joshua did with the ark or Moses did at
[47:24] the Red Sea with his staff. He's never
[47:26] He's never experienced this before. He's
[47:28] come to a new walk in his life. Amen.
[47:30] And then here is here is Elijah takes
[47:32] his mantle smites the Jordan and then
[47:35] they cross the Jordan. Then what happens
[47:36] is yo Elijah asks Elijah, "What can I do
[47:39] for you now? You've been with me all
[47:41] this time. You've never left my side.
[47:43] Now what do you want?" Amen. And what do
[47:46] we want as the bride of Jesus Christ?
[47:48] Lord, we want you to live like never
[47:49] before. Lord, we want you to live in our
[47:51] lives, Lord Jesus. We want to see your
[47:53] word manifested. We don't want to be
[47:55] made in the image of Shakina Tabernacle.
[47:57] We don't want to be made in the image of
[47:59] even of Brother Brandon. We want to be
[48:00] made in the image of Jesus Christ, the
[48:02] word. Amen. That's what we want. Amen.
[48:04] Like brother Ram says that, you know,
[48:06] many people, they get people to a
[48:08] theory. They get people to a church. But
[48:11] you see, that's not what we're meant to
[48:12] do. We meant to get people to Christ,
[48:13] the living word, where the word becomes
[48:16] real and alive in their lives. Amen. So,
[48:19] we don't want to get people to a theory
[48:20] of the message.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; If we do that, we've miserably failed.
[48:24] Amen. But if we get the people to the
[48:25] God of the message, which is the Lord
[48:28] Jesus Christ, the God of the Bible, we
[48:30] have achieved what God has placed us
[48:31] here to achieve.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, now here is Elisha. He's
[48:35] watching Elijah. They cross Jordan. And
[48:38] then you know um Elisha says to Elijah
[48:41] after he's asked what can I do for you
[48:44] and Elisha says I want a double portion.
[48:46] I want a double portion of your spirit.
[48:48] There's a inspiration struck Elisha.
[48:51] This is what I want. Amen. I don't just
[48:53] want the same as what you have. I want
[48:55] more. Amen. Because he that believeth on
[48:58] me Jesus says amen. These works you do
[49:00] and greater than these shall you do cuz
[49:02] I go to my father. Amen. So there's
[49:04] going to be more. Amen. And you we know
[49:06] it's giving you imparting eternal life
[49:08] whether through the preaching of the
[49:09] word creating an atmosphere not just
[49:11] preaching but living a life creating
[49:13] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost you can
[49:14] impart eternal life to others that's a
[49:17] greater work.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's greater in that extent and
[49:20] it's more why because there's more
[49:22] people God is in
[49:24] &gt;&gt; to prove his word through.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like many times people think,
[49:28] man, if we could only go back to, you
[49:30] know, one of the meetings there, maybe
[49:31] in Durban or maybe, you know, one of the
[49:33] great healing campaign meetings, you're
[49:35] going to realize if you took the bride
[49:37] of Jesus Christ and brought every
[49:39] testimony together, it's greater than
[49:41] that cuz it's more. It's just diffused
[49:43] through the world. Amen. That same
[49:45] spirit is now around the world healing,
[49:48] raising the dead, casting out devils.
[49:50] Amen. Preaching the word, filling with
[49:52] the Holy Ghost, doing signs and wonders.
[49:53] It's all around the world.
[49:56] Praise the Lord. And that's what God
[49:57] intended it to be. Amen. So then Elijah
[50:00] says, "Well, you ask a hard thing, but
[50:02] if you see me when I go,
[50:04] I'm trying to find it here. If you see
[50:06] me when I go, then you shall have it."
[50:10] So, so, so what did Elisha do? He kept
[50:13] his both eyes upon Elijah because he
[50:16] knew that that that what he asked, he's
[50:17] going to receive. Amen. It's the same
[50:19] thing with you and I. We can't have one
[50:21] eye on the world and one eye on on the
[50:23] Lord. would have both eyes on brother
[50:26] says both eyes on Calvary, both eyes on
[50:29] the Lord Jesus Christ. Don't worry about
[50:30] what's going on in the world. I tell you
[50:32] what, the thing that can help your world
[50:35] is you get a double portion of the
[50:37] anointing. Amen. You keep your eyes on
[50:39] the Lord, that will fix everything
[50:41] around you. Amen. Because if we keep one
[50:43] eye on the on the world, we're saying,
[50:44] "Well, how can I fix this humanly?"
[50:46] We'll never fix it. I got problems with
[50:49] my home, problems in the family,
[50:50] children, job, whatever more. You keep
[50:52] both eyes on the Lord, knowing those
[50:54] things are there, not ignoring them, but
[50:56] you keep both eyes on the word. Amen.
[50:57] Then God will give you the wisdom and
[50:59] understanding and he will step into your
[51:01] battle and he'll conquer it like you
[51:03] never could in your humanity.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. So now here he
[51:08] says you know if you do these so he kept
[51:10] both eyes on Elijah and then as he was
[51:12] keeping both eyes on Elijah that chariot
[51:14] of fire came down separated them took
[51:17] Elijah up into glory and what fell down
[51:19] was the mantle that God you that Elijah
[51:22] used to to to um smite the Jordan. So
[51:26] Elisha sees it. He picks it up. You know
[51:28] before he picks it up he cries, "My
[51:30] father, my father, the chariot of Israel
[51:32] and the horsemen thereof." basically is
[51:34] saying that Elijah had more value than
[51:36] the whole armies of Israel. I say the
[51:38] bride of Jesus Christ, this this
[51:40] revealed word has has more value than
[51:44] all the bombs in the world.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; You know, you being alive, present is
[51:50] holding back the wrath of God. It's
[51:52] holding back bombs flying, destruction.
[51:56] The bride of Jesus Christ around the
[51:57] world is holding that back.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandon says, "Before one
[52:03] bomb drops," talking about atomic bombs
[52:04] on America, the bride will be gone.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, let's witness while
[52:11] we're here.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Let's be a living witness while we're
[52:13] here. God saves. God redeems. His word
[52:15] is true. Amen. So, he picks up now. He
[52:18] picks up that, you know, picks up that
[52:20] mantle. He goes back to the Jordan to
[52:22] where they crossed. And what does he do?
[52:24] He asks the question. He says, "Where is
[52:27] the God of Elijah?"
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happened is he
[52:31] smoked the, you know, smoked the um
[52:33] smoked the uh waters with the mantle and
[52:36] it parted exactly as it did when Elijah
[52:39] did it. So now it's not it's not Elisha.
[52:42] It's not Elisha looking at Elijah doing
[52:44] it. The same God that was in Elijah
[52:48] parting the waters is now the same God
[52:50] in Elisha doing the same things. Amen.
[52:52] So now Elisha is there and he's
[52:55] realized, hey, the God of Elijah is in
[52:57] me. Amen. He's not a historical God. God
[53:00] did not go up in the chariot with with
[53:02] with Elijah only and now there's no God
[53:05] upon the earth. Jehovah's left the
[53:07] building. No, Jehovah God is present.
[53:10] Amen. And Jesus Christ is present. I was
[53:12] bringing to our day language because
[53:14] Jehovah of the old is Jesus Christ of
[53:16] the new. Amen. So he smoked the Jordan
[53:18] and you know and what that do God proved
[53:21] to him as I was with the prophet, I'm
[53:24] with the bride. Amen. As I was with
[53:26] brother Araham, I'm with the bride of
[53:27] Jesus Christ around the world. Amen. The
[53:30] same anointing, the same power, but we
[53:32] know Elijah I mean Elisha did twice the
[53:35] number of miracles, right? Elijah did
[53:37] four and Elisha did eight. And you know
[53:40] the last I'm just going to kind of wind
[53:42] this up here, but you know you know the
[53:43] last miracle that Elisha did was
[53:45] actually Elisha because he did you know
[53:48] he did seven miracles and then he got
[53:50] sick and that sickness took him to
[53:52] death. And now that's when the critics
[53:54] started their websites up and said,
[53:55] "Hey, this guy said he had a double
[53:57] portion, but he's only done seven
[53:59] miracles. He must have been a false
[54:00] prophet." But there was war going on in
[54:02] Israel and Elisha was dead. He was
[54:05] buried in a seplica. And some men were
[54:07] carrying some men were carrying a dead
[54:09] friend of theirs from the battle. And
[54:10] they thought, "Man, what are we going to
[54:12] do with this guy?" And they just threw
[54:13] the threw him into this hole into this
[54:15] pit. They didn't realize it was Elisha's
[54:16] seplica. And when that dead man made
[54:18] contact with Elisha's bones, he came
[54:20] back to life. Amen. to the last miracle
[54:23] Elisha did was the resurrection of the
[54:25] dead. Amen. I tell you what, friends,
[54:27] the last miracle the bride of Jesus
[54:29] Christ is going to do by the life of God
[54:31] within them is going to bring the dead
[54:32] in Christ out of the grave. Amen.
[54:35] There's going to be a resurrection of
[54:36] those who have died in Christ down
[54:38] through seven church ages.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That's why it's so
[54:41] important. Walk in this double portion
[54:43] of the anointing. Amen. Remember Elisha
[54:45] wasn't even conscience conscious. He was
[54:48] dead. He was somewhere else. But that
[54:50] quickening power was so real within him.
[54:52] Amen. That it laid within his bones.
[54:54] Amen. So it wasn't him consciously
[54:56] saying, "I've got to raise this person
[54:57] from the dead. I've got to bring the
[54:59] Christ, you know, the dead in Christ
[55:00] from the grave." No, it was it's not us
[55:02] consciously needing to do anything. It's
[55:04] just the quickening power of the Holy
[55:06] Ghost living in us. Amen. Will bring
[55:08] them from the grave.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I say, so why do you say it
[55:15] like that? Just relax.
[55:18] Just relax and let the mantle live.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; The mantle is the baptism of the Holy
[55:23] Ghost, the living word. Just let it
[55:25] live. Amen. Don't be so fixated on I've
[55:28] got to do this and that, whatever more.
[55:30] Just live a genuine loving Christian
[55:32] life.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be a light wherever you go. Amen.
[55:36] Love everybody. Speak peaceibly with
[55:38] everyone. Live peaceibly with everyone.
[55:41] Amen. Just pray, "Lord, I want to be
[55:43] salty today."
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. and an atmosphere of God will
[55:46] begin to live out of your life. Amen.
[55:48] And you'll begin to see God begin to do
[55:50] the supernatural without you even being
[55:52] conscious of it.
[55:55] Amen. Do you believe that?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did brother say when he came
[55:58] down to the end of the seals? He says,
[55:59] "Just live a simple Christian life." And
[56:02] that simple Christian life as some
[56:04] people have taken it means well some
[56:06] people have taken it and said, "Well, we
[56:08] don't need to know what the revelation
[56:09] of the word is." That's not what he's
[56:10] saying. He's saying just live a simple
[56:13] loving the Lord life. Walk with God.
[56:16] He'll unfold himself to you. Amen. Just
[56:18] keep walking in the light as he is in
[56:20] the light and he'll unfold his word to
[56:22] you as you walk.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not exciting. That's very
[56:28] exciting. That's incredibly exciting
[56:30] that I can just love the Lord and walk
[56:31] with him and he can reveal himself. As
[56:34] God wanted to have fellowship with me
[56:36] before the fall, he can have it with me
[56:38] now.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Why? because as I walk with him, just
[56:41] like Elisha walked with Elijah and
[56:43] Elisha was being molded into the image
[56:45] of a son of God. Same thing with us.
[56:48] We're walking with the word now. See, as
[56:50] I said uh you know a while ago, this
[56:52] church can't take you into adoption. It
[56:54] can't it can't take you into manhood
[56:56] into or into womanhood, right? It's like
[56:59] Ruth and Moab. She could never come to
[57:01] her position there. But under the
[57:03] leadership of Naomi, which represents
[57:05] the Orthodox, you know, old church,
[57:07] right? under her leadership, she could
[57:09] come to Boaz's feet and come to her
[57:11] position in the body. Right? So now, it
[57:13] wasn't Moab and her parents telling her
[57:16] what to do to raise her, to bring her to
[57:17] that position. It was the word
[57:19] instructing her life. Amen. And it's the
[57:22] same thing with us men as well. It's
[57:24] only the word, only the Lord himself can
[57:26] place you, take you to adoption, take
[57:29] you to your position. Amen. plowing
[57:33] plowing um plowing fields and doing what
[57:35] you're you know I'm not here to build
[57:37] more loins
[57:39] even my own children I want to see them
[57:42] made in the image of daughters and son
[57:44] of god
[57:45] &gt;&gt; that's what I want to see
[57:47] &gt;&gt; amen I don't want them to continue on in
[57:49] like the not that we have a family trade
[57:51] but you know I don't want to mold them
[57:53] into well this is what I was like son
[57:55] you've got to be like me you've got to
[57:57] be do science you got to do this you got
[57:58] to love this you got to no I don't want
[58:00] to mold my children that way. I want
[58:03] them to know the Lord and God take them
[58:05] on from where I can't take them humanly
[58:08] can take them into the full image of the
[58:10] word.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; And this is and and this is friends,
[58:15] this is what it's all about. You and
[58:17] Christ together.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said I was going to stop, but
[58:22] actually I've changed my mind.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because what is it that what is it
[58:28] that let's let's make it more tangible.
[58:31] What is it that molds us and shapes us?
[58:34] Okay, it's our spiritual diet
[58:38] is vital in this.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Okay, we cannot expect to eat McDonald's
[58:43] Christianity and come out strong, tough,
[58:46] and made in the image of the word. Okay,
[58:49] who's seen it's it's probably so old now
[58:51] the documentary Superersized Me,
[58:54] &gt;&gt; right? The guy had other health issues,
[58:55] but he just ate McDonald's for a month.
[58:57] It didn't do him any favors. Okay, he
[59:00] became a living walking Big Mac.
[59:03] Not a good idea. Spiritually, very bad
[59:05] idea. Okay, but you but if we could see
[59:08] the value of what the Lord has deposited
[59:10] in this day for us to eat, I think it
[59:13] would change everything about us. Okay,
[59:16] because even I found it very
[59:17] interesting. Sorry girls and Esther and
[59:19] William, but you're going to go through
[59:20] family prayer again. But you know, it's
[59:22] amazing how the reason the children of
[59:24] Israel called mana manner is because
[59:26] they didn't know what it was.
[59:28] I got it in yellow down there. Okay, I'm
[59:29] just going to skip through this really
[59:30] quickly. But God said, "I'm going to
[59:32] bring bread out of heaven." And they
[59:34] called it mana because what is this
[59:36] stuff? Well, it was bread. God said it
[59:37] was bread. Okay, and then the psalmist
[59:40] would pick it up and say, "Man did eat
[59:42] angels food." So, it's more than just
[59:44] bread. More than just, you know,
[59:47] something that came. Well, what is this
[59:48] that came out of heaven? Angels food is
[59:51] what they lived on during their time in
[59:53] the wilderness.
[59:54] And then Jesus would come and say, "I am
[59:57] the true bread."
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That came out. I am the bread of
[1:00:00] life. I am the true bread. Bread that
[1:00:02] came out of heaven. So we can't call.
[1:00:05] But really, when when when the you know
[1:00:07] when the Israel um Israelites and stuff
[1:00:10] are looking at the Lord Jesus, they call
[1:00:12] could have called him mana. We don't
[1:00:13] know where this guy is from. What is
[1:00:15] this? What is this man saying to us?
[1:00:18] Right? But he's saying now I am the true
[1:00:19] bread that came out of heaven. Amen. He
[1:00:22] that you eateth me liveth on me shall
[1:00:24] never live. I mean I mean I mean shall
[1:00:25] never die. He says for for the bread of
[1:00:28] God which uh is which he is he which
[1:00:31] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[1:00:33] unto the world. And then they said unto
[1:00:35] him, Lord, ever more give us this bread.
[1:00:37] Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of
[1:00:38] life. He that cometh to me shall never
[1:00:40] hunger, and he that believeth me shall
[1:00:42] never thirst. So now this word that
[1:00:44] this, you know, this this bread we live
[1:00:47] off, this spiritual word is a person.
[1:00:49] It's Christ Jesus the Lord. And even
[1:00:52] brother Brandham would come down to
[1:00:53] anointed ones in the end time. One of
[1:00:54] his, you know, halfway through the last
[1:00:56] year he'd be um alive. He says, "I
[1:00:58] wasn't the one that appeared down on the
[1:00:59] river." Speaking about when he was
[1:01:01] baptizing in 1933, I was only performing
[1:01:05] uh sorry, standing there where when he
[1:01:07] appeared. I'm not the one that performs
[1:01:09] these things and fortell these things
[1:01:11] that happens as perfect as they are. I'm
[1:01:14] only one that's near when he does it. I
[1:01:16] was only a voice that he used to say it.
[1:01:18] It wasn't what I knew. That's what I
[1:01:21] just surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:01:23] through it. It isn't me. It wasn't the
[1:01:25] seventh angel. Oh, no. It was the
[1:01:27] manifestation of the son of man. It
[1:01:29] wasn't the angel, his message. It was
[1:01:31] the mystery that God unfolded. It's not
[1:01:33] a man. It's God. The angel was not the
[1:01:35] son of man. He was the messenger from
[1:01:37] the son of man. The son of man is
[1:01:39] Christ. He's the one you're feeding on.
[1:01:42] Okay? So, I'm just listening to a
[1:01:44] message. What are you feeding on? You're
[1:01:46] feeding off the revelation of Jesus
[1:01:48] Christ himself. Amen. You're not feeding
[1:01:50] on a man. A man his words will fail.
[1:01:53] Amen. You're feeding on the unfailing
[1:01:55] body word of the son of man. So we're
[1:01:57] not feeding on the opinions of William
[1:01:59] Brandham. We're feeding on the true
[1:02:01] revelation of the word.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So aren't you glad this is what
[1:02:06] we're feeding on. See, as you as you eat
[1:02:09] the word, you become the word.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; That's why your spiritual diet, I trust
[1:02:13] it's good. I trust spiritually you're
[1:02:15] you're fat and flourishing,
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; right? I trust you are spiritually.
[1:02:20] Okay? Because you realize no, as I feed
[1:02:23] off the word, I become the word. Like
[1:02:25] brother says in the rapture message, I
[1:02:27] don't have the quote on me, but he says,
[1:02:28] "But the shout brings forth a living
[1:02:30] bread which makes a living bride." Amen.
[1:02:33] The word itself.
[1:02:36] But you see, sometimes we're like, and
[1:02:38] and I can say I'm like this. We're like
[1:02:39] a hog under an apple tree.
[1:02:42] Amen. He'll he'll eat apples all day.
[1:02:44] They'll beat him on the head and he'll
[1:02:46] never look up. see which way they're
[1:02:47] coming. Well, that's just the way we
[1:02:49] are. We just absolutely God will pour
[1:02:51] his blessings upon us. And then we never
[1:02:53] look up to say, "Thank you, Lord. I'm so
[1:02:54] glad to be here. Thank you that you give
[1:02:56] me something to eat." We just go ahead
[1:02:58] like he owed it to us. We owe him. He
[1:03:02] owes us nothing. We owe all we are to
[1:03:05] him.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, he owes me this."
[1:03:09] No, no. He doesn't owe you nothing. We
[1:03:12] owe everything we are to him. Now, I'm
[1:03:14] not saying you're a bunch of hogs under
[1:03:15] an apple tree. You know where this comes
[1:03:17] from, okay? But I think we should
[1:03:19] appreciate more the fact that the Lord
[1:03:21] has sent a word to transform us into the
[1:03:25] image of his son. Amen. How God wanted
[1:03:29] us to be in the beginning before the
[1:03:30] fall. Talking about the inner man. Okay?
[1:03:33] That we're not made in the image of a
[1:03:35] fallen Adam. We're made in the image of
[1:03:37] Jesus Christ, the word.
[1:03:39] That's a beautiful thing. Amen. Let's
[1:03:42] have the musicians tonight.
[1:03:51] Amen. So why does man make robots like
[1:03:53] men? They want to make something in
[1:03:54] their image. They can't help it. It's
[1:03:57] built in them cuz God wants someone in
[1:04:00] his image. I'll say they're trying to do
[1:04:02] it. God's already achieved it.
[1:04:06] Amen. He's made you, well, I've got all
[1:04:09] of my faults and failings, whatever
[1:04:10] more. Don't look at the outward man.
[1:04:13] What about the inner man? He's changing
[1:04:15] you from glory to glory. The person you
[1:04:18] once were, you're not that person
[1:04:19] anymore. You've taken a step higher.
[1:04:22] Amen. Step closer to the Lord. Why?
[1:04:24] Because God is transforming us into his
[1:04:26] image. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:30] Amen. Let's stand tonight, shall we?
[1:04:36] Amen. Let's let's bow our heads and then
[1:04:39] we'll we'll sing a song, shall we? We
[1:04:41] can sing that. Goodness of God. Bless
[1:04:43] you. Let's bow our heads today. Tonight.
[1:04:46] Amen. Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads
[1:04:48] tonight, we just ask, Father, that may
[1:04:51] you continue to mold us, to shape us,
[1:04:53] Lord Jesus, into your image. Father,
[1:04:56] please forbid it, dear God, that anyone
[1:04:58] here would catch my spirit, my human
[1:05:01] spirit. Lord, I don't want that. Not for
[1:05:03] a second, Lord. Not here to reproduce
[1:05:06] spiritually myself in any way. That's
[1:05:08] just weird. Lord, I just I I desire that
[1:05:11] you would come in, dear God, and you
[1:05:13] would produce yourself in us, Father.
[1:05:15] Lord, as true sons and daughters of the
[1:05:18] most high God, grant it, Father, we
[1:05:20] commit our lives into your hands. I ask,
[1:05:22] dear, God, that may we, Lord, may we not
[1:05:25] stop in our Christian walk. Lord, like
[1:05:26] Elisha, he he wasn't willing to stop
[1:05:28] anywhere, no matter where Elijah told
[1:05:30] him to tarry. He was staying right with
[1:05:32] Elisha. I mean, right right with Elijah.
[1:05:35] And dear God, we want to stay right by
[1:05:37] you, dear God. We don't want to wander
[1:05:38] off somewhere. We don't want to stop.
[1:05:40] May we continue to walk with you, Lord
[1:05:43] Jesus. May we walk with you in the light
[1:05:45] as you're in the light, Lord. And may
[1:05:46] you continue to reveal yourself to us.
[1:05:50] We love you so much, Lord. We want more
[1:05:51] of you. Grant it, dear God. Continue to
[1:05:54] reveal yourself to us, Lord, in our
[1:05:56] personal walks with you, Lord. Lord, I
[1:05:59] just pray when we open your word, when
[1:06:00] we hear the message, Lord Jesus, when we
[1:06:02] come to church, I pray you' just anchor
[1:06:04] more of yourself within us, Lord. Mature
[1:06:06] us, mold us, shape us, Lord, into your
[1:06:08] image. We love you so much and we thank
[1:06:10] you, Lord. We praise you with, Lord, in
[1:06:12] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:06:16] Amen. Amen. Let's sing Goodness of God,
[1:06:19] shall we? And then I'll turn the service
[1:06:20] to you, Brother Josh. That's okay. Amen.
[1:06:25] I love you, Lord.
[1:06:30] For your mercies never fail me.
[1:06:35] All my days
[1:06:38] I've been held in your hands.
