let's um open our Bibles in the the book of Hebrews chapter 11 the Hall of Fame of the faith can read on verse 8 and the Bible says oh thank you guys by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he soj joed in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob the is with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which had foundations who Builder and maker is God Amen what a faith let's pray thank you Lord God Almighty I want to ask you to please talk through me to bless your bride Lord please use me Lord if we want to ask you this in Jesus Christ's name amen am you can have your SE so I don't know why I don't know how but I got this thought about to talk the New Jerusalem because we know that we are looking for a city that's right but I wanted to talk today about this city yeah and there's some things that brother brand talks about this city that is going to be have like a pyramid shape and it's going to be huge it's going to be awesome so we can keep reading here in the Hallelujah book of uh Hebrews and says for they that say such things de clear plainly that they seek a country yeah not truly if they have been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but but now they desire a bitter country that is and Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he had prepared for them a city amen Lord thank you Jesus I wanted to talk a little bit about Abraham and how he truly trust in the Lord to just take his family and just move to a random place that he didn't even know anything about it Cu uh how many of you guys are kiwis like fully kiwis can you LIF okay most of us I would say we came from another land but we heard about New Zealand we saw pictures probably we saw videos we knew that a country called New Zealand exist but Abraham he didn't know anything he just went for it for it because the Lord said to him now you go and find the city but Abraham also had his body changed and he got this the promised son so he knew that the one that gave him the promise was truly Unfaithful so that's why he was he just took that promise and yes he just went for it amen and we know that we are pilgrims and we have that song that we sing this world is not my home I'm just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue the Angels Beck on me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore that's right that's how um how do you say the thing that's how amen um also um wanted to say something about human migration and here's where um most of us we take some part in this and it says since earliest time humanity has been on the move some people move in search of work or Economic Opportunity to join family or to study all the move to escape conflict persecution or large scale human rights violations we move here to New Zealand because we saw like a better opportunity here that's why we just left our country talking my personal case but you know like that's why we are waiting for that City because we know there is a better place to go Hallelujah there's nothing like that we fully trust in the Lord that he is going to that he's preparing for us that City that's going to be so much better than this world Hallelujah but if we talk about migration we can find this a kind of fantastic and weird kind of migration what we what you looking there is a init people that they move from that where the theory said that um there was a bridge from Siberia to Alaska and they cross over the Arctic but they just stopped there some people say that they sto because there were some tribes that they were like Warriors they you know they were fighting so they didn't let them keep coming through so they just stopped there can you even imagine to live there you can go to the snow for a couple of hours for one day or two and then you go back home but they live there probably that Uncle Bob catching some something for breakfast that's tough condition yeah really tough condition and like in a a spiritual journey like sometimes we can be in a place like that can you imagine we're just so hard and some people they can just stop in a very desertic place don't stop there just keep migrating to a better place also wanted to put a picture of some people that they're living in desert man I can't imagine how it can be that they heat no water what kind of vges can you grow there probably nothing what a tough condition of Life to Live very hard and out of all those places like very desertic places we can also find something different that's does anyone know the name of that River the Snake River Snake River no it's the Amazon you right the Amazon River you can see all the vegetation so green but there's a saying and it's like every creature in the Amazon evolve to kill humans you can find spiders very long anacondas you can find a very kind of weird alligator there even like microscopic fish that they can really give you really bad pain B J and I think you know like in the Amazon river that everything evolve to destroy kind of kill humans that's how the world is now yeah everything it was just so corrupted yeah and like doesn't matter where you go even if you're in your house you have a phone and that's just rubish rubbish everywhere you can't stop it you go out to a shop the music that they're playing the clothes that they're wearing it's like everything was just corrupted to kind of send humans to hell but here do you know what's that pictor Shannon you you American well that's the fall of Saigon in Vietnam that's when the when the Gringos they had to run away cuz the Viet Kong was going to to hit them and hit them really hard so they just had to evacuate but they call it extraction so what's an extraction this extraction says in military tactics says um is a process of removing Personnel when it considered imperative that they be immediately immediately relocated of a hostile environment and taken to an area either occupied or controlled by friendly personal we are waiting for our extraction we are waiting for that Raptor that's going to take us out of here of this corrupted world Amen but let's talk a little bit more of the city that was the initial thought oh man you're not going to read that can you read that and here is John this is John talking Revelation 21 and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it and the city had no need of of the sun neither of the moon to shine in for the glory of the Lord that lighted it and the lamb is a light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it you Lord and the king of the earth to bring their Glory and Honor into it and the gates of it shall be no shot at all by day for there shall be no night there amen and they shall bring the glory and honor of the nation in into it and there shall be and there shall in no wise enter into any that defileth neither whatsoever work Abominations or Marth a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life thank you Lord we I sometimes I I use it word lucky but there's no luck we're just so blessed that our names are written there in the book of life that we have something so much better waiting for us only if we truly trust in the promise of the Lord and um we can read here in First Corinthian chapter six who are the kind of person that they are not going to enter and he is know you know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicated nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of thems with mankind no thieves no kishes no drunkers no revilers is that how you say that way nor extortionist shall inherit the kingdom of God and such were some of you man [Laughter] Paul and such way some of you but ye are washed and ye are Sanctified ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God man what a blessing we when you think about this we haven't done anything anything and man when we go to heaven you can't say oh I did this and did that no man you you didn't do anything it's just him the Lord that love you so much and I got a quote here man I talk fast I thought it was going to you're doing well thank we have a go here saying um he I think I delete one give me a second oh boy probably can I can talk I can tell a little testimony while I try to find the the missing quote here oh give me a second oh no it's here amen this is the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride brother Bram said I only have the second part but says and Christ has gone and is preparing a place that's been on its construction for many many thousand of years preparing a place and if I go and prepare a place I will come again and receive you that wherever I am there you may be also notice the Redeemer and the redeem amen oh no sorry I'm going to read the first part and in the new Earth there is a new city oh my now listen close don't forget this that Jesus said in John 14 he will go to prepare let not your heart be troubled when he is going away I have a reason to go away youve believe in God he said believe also in me they couldn't see that he was God see it you've belied in God now you believe in me and I'm going to prepare a place for you in my father's house is many mensions in my father's kingdom is many palaces Christ is there under the construction of his New Jerusalem now now listen listen listen close don't move don't miss this Christ is in heaven today preparing the New Jerusalem can you imagine a city that's being created for God for 2,000 years Jesus um just as God created the Earth in 6 days May the Earth in 6 days or 6,000 years as he said be not ignorant we read in the scripture one day 1,000 years is one day yes right amen and yeah can you imagine that City it's written that the man we're going to be walking on gold gold is so expensive here but we are going to be walking on gold it is amen you you you can see like um how God he Through the Bible he gave Moses some plans to create something to build something the temple the minora all those beautiful things but they were not constructed by God God gave the indications but this city is designed and and made by go by God Amen so to get into this city you have to receive the Holy Ghost which is your passport yes if you don't have this passport if you don't have the Holy Ghost there's no way that you can get into the holy city that's how important is to receive the Holy Ghost we having a prayer meeting you can pray to receive the Holy Ghost and I can think you can receive it tonight amen I have a I have a story with with visas and passport cuz I'm a foreigner so when I came here to New Zealand I walk out the the plane and of course custom a young Latino guy over here place so they draft me straight away and I was a little bit scared I couldn't speak any English if you think my English is bad now imagine there when I just came and I saw the customers I start checking my backpack my suitcase and they just left and then at the distance I saw this um kind of place or something with a dog I was man I'm done cuz I I took here to New Zealand a backpack that I used to put some weed in it so the dog came smell everything so this dog came was like a little bigle or something and he made my backpack and he sat down I said man I'm done I'm done customers I took the backpack they start cheing everything and I I accept the Lord while I was on the plane and I received the Holy Ghost there too CU my life changed yes so I couldn't lie man it was so hard oh my but when the C when the police said to me do you have any drugs in the backpack I have no idea how I say it but I said to them I used to have drugs in the backpack but there's no drugs now and they walk into the office they came out they walk into they make me wait like two hours they was deciding what they were going to do with me cuz I didn't have any drugs but I was like a dodgy Latino guy so after all that talking they said to me cuz Chile had like an agreement with the New Zealand that we were going to we were we were able to come here for 3 month for holidays and then go back they said to me we are only going to give you seven days and then you have to leave the country you take it otherwise we we put you in the next plane and you go back to Chile man I was sad I really wanted to come here but I went to cry Church where Pedro used um where Pedro lives and we do all the papers and applications and I got three month to receive a Visa tourist visa and then we extended to six months and then I got a work visa and then another work visa and then they said to me I I receive an email saying okay now you have been here for a while now you have to leave the country for one year and then you can come back and I was already talking to Stephanie we were we had plans to get married and they were going to send me back but I did a promise with the Lord I said to him Lord just send me back to Chile when I'm ready to go back cuz it's very hard when you have all your friends in the same place that you used to live with when you were not a Christian now if you're a Christian all your friends are like what happened to you and I bought the ticket to go back to Chile I was ready I was ready to go and then immigration sent me another email and they said doe covid-19 we are more than happy for you to stay and we are extend your visa for 3 years it was almost like please don't go cuz we cannot get anyone else just stay here wow and the point of that story is like the Visa the Holy Spirit if you don't have a Visa you cannot stay in a country you cannot even get into a country you can come they can send you back that's right but if you have the Holy Ghost you are seal till the day of your Redemption that's that's how important is to receive the Holy Ghost amen and well that's all what I have for you tonight I hope it's a blessing for you we can have the musician amen hallelujah amen and um can we please sing um the city where the lamb is light amen well God bless your [Applause] Saints [Music] [Music] there's a
