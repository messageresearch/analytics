[16:42] seats here this
[16:47] morning that's it for
[16:49] John um yep oh sister
[16:55] Shannon in my
[16:57] heart
[17:18] that the for our children and I don't
[17:21] know what I would do if I was not
[17:22] Christian and have children it is is
[17:25] hard even to be a Christi children
[17:29] is and
[17:36] US
[17:40] few with children one was was
[17:45] baby
[17:48] he W him up too much and he was going
[17:51] through time he was feverish anyway my w
[17:54] up and then when I went and checked
[17:57] on
[17:58] you
[18:03] know anyways he just wouldn't stop and
[18:06] everything was coming out of him he was
[18:08] too hot he was anding and all the
[18:11] liquids just completely poured out of
[18:12] them and um you know when they lose
[18:15] control thees of their eyes show and
[18:18] here's Isaac and I were just going
[18:20] what's going on we didn't know what was
[18:21] going on because we're firsttime parents
[18:23] never even come across this stuff so
[18:25] guess what I did I tried to feed Isaac
[18:28] wrapped him up in a blanket and we
[18:30] walked around with him praying he should
[18:33] have died you know he should have died
[18:35] we did completely the wrong thing you
[18:37] should have been brain damage um but but
[18:40] in our in the prayer the Lord knew what
[18:43] what he was doing and through the prayer
[18:45] he's even too smart for his own good
[18:50] now so and the Lord just looked after
[18:53] him and the other the other time was
[18:55] quite a um miraculous
[18:57] heing
[18:59] um I given him some um
[19:02] medication later on they pulled it off
[19:04] the shelf but um he was just had a
[19:06] snipple and i' given it to him and I was
[19:08] I I was feeding a baby and when I turned
[19:10] around I given Jessie a piece of like
[19:13] white bread while he was laying there
[19:14] you know not feeling well and I turned
[19:16] around after feeding and I looked and um
[19:18] he was just lying there de pretty much
[19:22] the the his eyes or she just wasn't
[19:24] responsive at all and I thought oh
[19:26] goodness tried waking him up and then
[19:30] that wasn't working so I um went
[19:32] downstairs and I you know maneuvered him
[19:34] to get the bread out that came out but
[19:36] no response whatsoever put him under the
[19:38] shower no
[19:40] response by this time it was you know a
[19:43] couple minute old seemed like ages
[19:45] anyway so when all fa I lifted up up and
[19:49] I cried I cried out and I said Lord help
[19:53] me but I was like a furious like oh Lord
[19:56] he's going to die any um he came to
[20:00] right then his eyes started coming back
[20:02] and he started breathing again and then
[20:05] I just held him for a while and and he
[20:08] came back he came right and then Satan
[20:11] came creeping in my head and go you know
[20:14] it was that it was just because you did
[20:17] that and I was like no can I just start
[20:19] I I thank the Lord of course I was
[20:21] singing and thanking the Lord but that
[20:24] that little bit of Doubt came in you
[20:25] know oh you know wasn't
[20:28] I open my bible right you know how
[20:31] sometimes you just flip open your Bible
[20:33] and you want to hear from God and this
[20:35] is what I turn to straight away read
[20:37] this in my distress I Cried unto the
[20:40] Lord and he hurt
[20:42] me and there are countless times
[20:45] countless times where the children come
[20:46] off and they say oh this person fell
[20:48] from a tree and you know how high up the
[20:50] leaves can climb I'm like okay and you
[20:52] just say thank you Lord for watching
[20:54] over our children and he does it every
[20:56] time never fa
[20:59] and so

[43:40] beloved be thou like a row or a young
[43:42] heart upon the mountains of Betha amen
[43:46] may the Lord bless his word you may you
[43:48] may be
[43:50] seated I want to I want
[43:52] to try and there's always things that
[43:55] you look in the word and you think it's
[43:57] far beyond a grasp of a human I feel
[44:00] definitely that way you know there's
[44:02] something there's something about the
[44:05] about the
[44:06] word that speaks to you like only God
[44:09] can speak you know it's more than just a
[44:13] this is more
[44:14] than this is more than words on paper
[44:18] it's more than a history book in some
[44:19] moral guide of life but God has so put
[44:23] himself in print form that we can read
[44:26] his word and no doubt many people have
[44:29] picked up the Bible and many people have
[44:30] read the Bible and many people have
[44:32] memorized the Bible but we understand
[44:34] it's a love letter to you that God would
[44:37] would so hide himself even in his word
[44:40] he's hidden from the eyes of the wise
[44:42] and prudent Jesus would thank the father
[44:44] he said thank you Father that these
[44:45] things are hidden from the eyes of the
[44:47] wise and prudent but revealed unto babes
[44:50] because here he was the word himself
[44:51] made flesh and he was standing there and
[44:54] you know among the most religious people
[44:56] in all the Earth and they should have
[44:57] seen him for what he was because they
[44:59] had the word they had had the word since
[45:02] you know you know since Moses would
[45:03] write it down and Moses was inspired to
[45:06] write the you know Genesis and the
[45:07] creation and all the way down the first
[45:09] five books of the Bible and you know
[45:11] they had the Prophecies of Isaiah they
[45:14] had the Prophecies of Jeremiah and all
[45:15] the prophets all the way down and they
[45:17] spoke of Christ Hallelujah they spoke of
[45:20] the word that had become flesh in their
[45:22] day and here he was standing in front of
[45:23] them interpreting the word he was the
[45:26] prophecies fulfilled he was the Old
[45:28] Testament fulfilled and he was standing
[45:29] there and they didn't recognize him for
[45:31] what he was am me because this was just
[45:34] a bunch of memory to them it was just
[45:37] something they had learned by memory
[45:39] they had you know those those ones and
[45:42] the old test of those scribes and
[45:43] Pharisees it said that they knew their
[45:45] Torah so well that when they rolled it
[45:47] up that when when they put a pin through
[45:51] the pages if they ever would do such a
[45:53] thing they could tell you the the the
[45:56] character on every page that it would
[45:58] pass through that's how well they knew
[46:00] the word was put together but that
[46:03] didn't give them eternal life Jesus said
[46:06] to them search ye the scriptures from
[46:08] them you think you have eternal life and
[46:10] they are they which testify of me amen
[46:13] so that he said you think you have
[46:15] eternal life search the scriptures and
[46:17] they did search the scriptures they were
[46:18] very knowledgeable in the scriptures but
[46:20] it didn't give them eternal life amen
[46:23] amen because they had not entered into a
[46:25] relationship ship with the author of the
[46:27] book 66 books in the Bible written over
[46:30] thousands of years but yet it's imp
[46:32] perfect continuity one does not
[46:34] contradict the other amen someone would
[46:36] speak of Prophecy here the other would
[46:38] enlarge on the prophecy here and then we
[46:40] can see it coming to its fulfillment
[46:42] further on the road Hallelujah this book
[46:45] is not just the writings of man or some
[46:47] moral ideas but this is God in print for
[46:50] amen do you really respect this just
[46:54] think about we have the word we have we
[46:56] have thus sayi the Lord in print form
[46:58] amen we have the voice of our beloved
[47:01] has been written down in in ink
[47:04] Hallelujah and he's been given to you
[47:06] amen and not only you can just read it
[47:08] but you can hear an audio version you
[47:09] can go wherever you want and you can
[47:10] hear the voice of God am mean you can
[47:13] hear the word for yourself amen but to
[47:16] you you but to some people and the very
[47:18] reason it doesn't mean that much to them
[47:20] they may think it's a wonderful thing
[47:22] they may even some people they get
[47:23] caught up in how well it's put together
[47:26] and they get caught up in the types and
[47:27] the shadows and they get caught up in
[47:29] the doctrine but it goes beyond just
[47:31] understanding Doctrine and types and
[47:32] shadows even though we should see these
[47:34] things and understand those things but
[47:36] it when it comes when that voice comes
[47:39] to you amen and you enter into that
[47:41] relationship for yourself amen where the
[47:44] voice of God means more than information
[47:46] to you or more than just church teaching
[47:48] or more than coming to a Sunday and just
[47:50] coming to church or or opening the pages
[47:53] but there's something in that voice amen
[47:55] Hallelujah there's something in the
[47:57] voice of God that can only that speaks
[48:00] to a person like only he can speak and
[48:03] notice I said he can speak not like not
[48:05] the word because he is the word amen he
[48:09] is the word he is a person and that
[48:12] person became flesh in Jesus Christ and
[48:15] then now but many people think well he
[48:17] finished speaking there and what what
[48:19] Peter James and John and Paul they wrote
[48:21] well that's just kind of their musings
[48:23] and things and maybe some people think
[48:24] well he stopped speaking there but God
[48:27] is the same in every generation amen
[48:29] he's the same yesterday today and
[48:31] forever we understand that it says in
[48:34] the Book of Revelation where where where
[48:36] where John is John is instructed to
[48:38] write to the write to the churches and
[48:40] we understand that you know you know in
[48:43] chapter one and then in other places in
[48:44] the Book of Revelation it's called a
[48:46] book of Prophecy so it is a prophetic
[48:49] book and it's speaking of future ages of
[48:51] the church it's not something that was
[48:53] fulfilled back there or it's going to be
[48:54] fulfilled one day today but we are in
[48:56] the midst of that book being fulfilled
[48:58] that's right and John am me let's just
[49:01] go to Revelations chapter
[49:03] 1 if you've heard the voice many people
[49:06] heard Jesus preach but they didn't hear
[49:09] the voice many people heard John the
[49:11] Baptist and there in the River Jordan
[49:13] and and preach repentance but they
[49:15] didn't hear the voice they heard desels
[49:17] you know they heard sound W strike their
[49:19] ear but they didn't hear the voice that
[49:21] was behind the voice and speak to their
[49:23] heart amen many people heard Jemiah and
[49:26] Moses you know Moses preached to
[49:28] Millions literally millions of people 2
[49:30] million came out of Egypt I think it was
[49:32] he preached to millions of people but
[49:34] yet only Caleb and Joshua heard the
[49:36] voice behind the voice in his you know
[49:38] in their generation and they said that's
[49:40] for me Hallelujah because God it's so I
[49:43] just I was just sitting there last night
[49:44] think how can I put this into words how
[49:47] God he he he he he projects things you
[49:50] know you know prophecy he kind of he
[49:52] kind of paints an image paints a picture
[49:54] and puts it before you
[49:56] amen you know you know like a prophecy
[49:58] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bring
[50:01] forth Emmanuel you know unto us a child
[50:03] is born unto us a son is given and he
[50:06] should be called counselor Prince of
[50:07] Peace the Mighty God that was God
[50:09] putting forth an image in front of the
[50:11] people through through Isaiah he was he
[50:13] was painting a picture with words and
[50:15] many people thought that that was an
[50:17] incredible thing how how could a woman
[50:19] ever bring forth a child never knowing a
[50:21] man but yet God was putting something
[50:23] before the people and
[50:25] and it took 800 years for it to be
[50:28] fulfilled but one day there was a
[50:30] predestinated little girl a young woman
[50:32] was upon the Earth no doubt when Isaiah
[50:35] said those things every every every man
[50:38] who had a young daughter about the age
[50:39] that could have a child they would think
[50:42] it's going to be my daughter amen it's
[50:44] going to be my daughter but God just let
[50:47] it linger there for 800 years but the
[50:49] picture was always there then finally
[50:52] there's a predestinated girl there amen
[50:54] amen and they would have they would have
[50:56] maybe the rabbi was inspired one day to
[50:59] pick up the scroll and open it to Isaiah
[51:01] and go to Isaiah what we call 9 and
[51:03] verse six and speak that scripture and
[51:05] and something something would have
[51:06] anchored in Mary this is more than a
[51:09] just coming to church for her that day
[51:11] it was more than just coming to the
[51:12] synagogue and maybe just more than
[51:14] hearing the word but something anchored
[51:16] in her heart Hallelujah something became
[51:18] alive to her I trust you can put
[51:20] yourself in those shoes as well am mean
[51:22] when you've heard the word something
[51:24] just just just just just
[51:26] something spoken to you like nothing
[51:27] else has spoken to you before and you
[51:29] know she would probably you know speak
[51:31] to Joseph say Joseph that was a
[51:33] different kind of service amen I mean
[51:35] there was a different kind of meeting
[51:36] I've never you know I've read that
[51:38] scripture before I've heard that
[51:40] scripture before especially now how we
[51:43] everyone's under expectation that the
[51:44] messiah's going to come amen but yet
[51:48] something that day spoke to me
[51:51] Hallelujah and then after that you know
[51:53] I'm just kind of dramatizing a little
[51:55] bit more but then you know just to make
[51:56] it you know the prophet dramatizes the
[51:58] word just to try and make it a bit more
[51:59] alive to you amen amen and then and then
[52:02] she would have been walking down am me
[52:04] to get water from the well maybe and
[52:06] there was a man about 200 lb 6ot strong
[52:09] looking man you know shoulder Hing lay H
[52:12] uh hair you know white robes and she you
[52:16] you know he said to her Hil Mary he had
[52:19] never he had never she met him before in
[52:21] her life and and and then but there was
[52:24] a presence around around this man that
[52:26] was very different to every other men
[52:28] she had ever walked in front of and and
[52:31] then he began to say to her I'm Gabriel
[52:33] sent from the presence of the Lord
[52:35] You're going to have the promised son
[52:38] she says how could this be I've never
[52:39] known a man he says yeah he said the
[52:42] holy spirit will overshadow you and
[52:44] you'll bring forth the Messiah and she
[52:47] just said Let It Be unto me according to
[52:48] your word hallelujah the image had been
[52:51] put in front of her Hallelujah and she
[52:54] just accepted what God God was telling
[52:55] her and she just stepped into what God
[52:58] had said Hallelujah that's the same
[53:00] thing even in this day when you know I
[53:02] was thinking of you know brother Brown
[53:04] preaching the future home and he would
[53:06] begin to describe the you know the great
[53:08] New Jerusalem that came you know you
[53:10] know was going to come out of God from
[53:11] Heaven it's going to rest upon this
[53:12] Earth and you know he would begin to go
[53:14] in how how God you know redeems the
[53:17] Earth the same way he redeems you amen
[53:20] how he baptized and then Peter picks us
[53:22] up in the scripture he said you know you
[53:24] know how you you how in Noah's Day the
[53:27] Earth was baptized with water that's
[53:29] right amen but sin came over in the ark
[53:32] it's the same thing with the believer
[53:33] repent and be baptized in the name of
[53:35] Jesus Christ every one of you for the
[53:37] remission of sins and you shall receive
[53:39] the gift of the Holy Ghost so the Earth
[53:41] was baptized with water but then sin
[53:43] still came over in the ark and we
[53:44] understand that it did and then Jesus
[53:46] came and he Sanctified the Earth by
[53:48] dropping his blood upon the Earth and
[53:50] and Paul says by one offering he has
[53:53] perfected forever them that are
[53:54] sanctified amen hallelujah so so so he
[53:57] Sanctified the Earth he cleansed the
[53:59] Earth but sin is still here amen and you
[54:01] can be Sanctified God can take the
[54:04] desire isn't that incredible I'm just
[54:06] going to be at home today isn't it
[54:08] Incredible God can just take a desire
[54:10] out of you amen we know you know people
[54:12] down in Nelson brother Maru and brother
[54:14] Clayton they were years at you know you
[54:17] know Alcoholics Anonymous and they were
[54:19] and and and their motto is once a once
[54:22] an addict always an addict that's that's
[54:25] that's AA and see the see the devil
[54:28] always throws something in front of you
[54:31] and it and it looks good but it's always
[54:33] living below your privilege amen and so
[54:35] so so that kept them that kept them from
[54:38] drinking but there was a desire but then
[54:40] one day they came into the presence of
[54:42] the Lord amen they you know they went to
[54:44] a little church where the word was being
[54:46] preached and the desire just left them
[54:48] hallelujah hallelujah amen see God can
[54:50] just take things from youen Hallelujah
[54:53] and then so now and then so he
[54:55] Sanctified just like we are repent and
[54:58] be baptized and we're Sanctified by by
[55:00] the blood of Jesus Christ and then God
[55:03] comes and dwells in us for service amen
[55:07] and then it's the same thing but then
[55:08] the thing is we're still in these Fallen
[55:11] bodies so remember your body is not
[55:13] redeemed yet amen your soul is redeemed
[55:17] this guy still wants to do things this
[55:19] guy I've got to drag him to church I've
[55:21] got to drag him along to listen to the
[55:23] word I've got to drag him along to read
[55:24] the Bible and pray he doesn't want to
[55:27] he's very comfortable Hallelujah because
[55:30] he's not redeemed but I trust there's
[55:31] something in here that is greater than
[55:33] this amen amen and then many times you
[55:36] know you know we may wrestle with things
[55:38] and fight against things many times just
[55:40] say Lord give me a desire that is
[55:42] greater than this desire that's in this
[55:44] thing and and if you do that he'll give
[55:47] you that desire and that desire will
[55:48] become greater Hallelujah you look at
[55:52] people that you know you know they lose
[55:54] incredible amounts of
[55:56] weight one day they had a desire for
[55:58] food and they went down in that
[55:59] direction but then there came a stronger
[56:02] desire in them to lose all that weight
[56:05] and then they lose the weight so so
[56:06] which desire wins the desire to lose the
[56:08] weight it's always the stronger desire
[56:11] will overcome the weaker desire amen
[56:13] amen so then now he fills us with the
[56:15] Holy Spirit I trust you can say I've had
[56:17] that experience my life has never been
[56:19] the same and then but then the thing is
[56:21] it's like at the end of the tribulation
[56:24] the Great Tribulation there's an atomic
[56:25] war amen and then of course we know you
[56:29] know there's the
[56:31] Millennium now in the Millennium there's
[56:34] still sin but it doesn't have an effect
[56:36] upon the Earth because Satan is bound by
[56:39] a chain of
[56:40] circumstance amen but there's still sin
[56:43] but it's bound yeah and then it's after
[56:46] that there's the great white Throne
[56:47] judgment and they're thrown to Lake of
[56:49] Fire and then sin is done away with so
[56:52] it's the same thing with us God comes
[56:54] down and dwells in you and then he takes
[56:57] a
[56:57] chain of his spirit and he binds this
[57:01] thing that it doesn't allow this thing
[57:04] to work anymore yes I am still wrestling
[57:07] well I trust you can look back and say
[57:09] I'm I'm gaining ground every day I'm
[57:12] winning battles things I used to fight
[57:14] against I've got victories and then
[57:15] greater victories and then greater
[57:17] victories what's happening there's a
[57:19] chain being put around oh hallelujah
[57:22] hallelujah so there's a chain of
[57:23] circumstance because the life of God
[57:25] comes into you and then sin can't
[57:27] operate it wants to do you think Satan
[57:29] just wants to sit back and watch the
[57:31] Millennium unfold if he could get his
[57:33] Filthy Hands in that place he would try
[57:35] and destroy it he'd try and destroy you
[57:37] if he could amen he would if he could
[57:40] he'd take your own personality and use
[57:42] it against you in such a way that it
[57:44] would drive you insane yes if he could
[57:47] hey he would he's not a gentleman he
[57:49] doesn't play by the rules he has no
[57:51] respect for
[57:53] anything amen I trust that there's a
[57:55] chain there and then of course now after
[57:58] the after the what you know great white
[58:00] Throne judgment then now there's a holy
[58:03] fire vaporizes burns up the earth the
[58:05] earth is still here but it's burnt off
[58:07] of the Holy Fire that not only the
[58:10] attributes of sin are burnt off but the
[58:12] devils are burnt off as well and then
[58:14] the New Jerusalem comes down and then
[58:16] there's no sin it's the same thing these
[58:19] bodies they need a they need a change
[58:22] they needed a Redemption amen but as as
[58:24] soon as as soon as now these bodies are
[58:27] changed the devil has absolutely no way
[58:29] of even getting a hold of you Hallelujah
[58:32] so remember we're still going to be
[58:34] these bodies are going to be changed
[58:36] amen these atoms are going to be changed
[58:39] same body it's going to be changed amen
[58:41] hallelujah just like the Earth same
[58:43] Earth but it's going to be
[58:44] renovated amen and so he begins to tell
[58:47] us about these things and he begins to
[58:49] paint a picture amen he's putting
[58:52] something remember he's taking scripture
[58:53] cuz all this ministry is is to reveal
[58:55] Christ in here it's not another Bible or
[58:58] some other thing it's revealing Jesus
[58:59] Christ in here amen so so so he begins
[59:02] to paint a picture about what the new
[59:04] heavens and new earth will be like and
[59:06] how we are redeemed in the process of
[59:08] redemption and he's and he's putting
[59:10] that out there because he's wanting you
[59:11] to see this is what you this is what you
[59:14] potentially are this is what you are and
[59:16] this is where you're going amen
[59:19] hallelujah I trust there's something in
[59:21] it when you just think of you think of
[59:23] that place and you know it's not just
[59:25] because you want to escape sin and this
[59:26] life is bad but you want to you want to
[59:30] go to be where he is amen amen amen you
[59:32] want to see him for as he is you just
[59:34] don't want to hear about him or even
[59:36] it's just not enough sometimes we feel
[59:38] his presence you know we may be anywhere
[59:40] in life we may be here but you just feel
[59:42] the presence of God come you feel that
[59:44] sweet humble feeling come over you and
[59:46] you know it's him and you love it and
[59:49] you just long for more of it amen
[59:51] hallelujah and even that because we know
[59:53] there's always more amen amen that's
[59:55] just a little foretaste of what we'll
[59:56] have over there but yet it's the same
[59:59] God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so
[1:00:02] he begins to project those things he
[1:00:04] begins to speak about an invisible Union
[1:00:07] you know you know between Christ and his
[1:00:08] bride and many people take that as a
[1:00:10] very hard sermon but he but he's
[1:00:12] speaking in you know spiritual ways and
[1:00:15] you know he's throwing something in you
[1:00:16] know you know before the people you can
[1:00:18] become one with him you can be United
[1:00:22] with him you can become as he's the word
[1:00:25] you become the word I mean the word word
[1:00:28] becomes one you be you you you become
[1:00:30] one with Christ and then he begins to
[1:00:33] say about before the foundation of the
[1:00:35] world he slipped on a wedding band of
[1:00:37] unmar predestinated Grace upon your
[1:00:40] finger Hallelujah what's he doing he's
[1:00:42] painting a picture for you to step into
[1:00:46] Hallelujah are you following me I trust
[1:00:49] I trust this is a blessing cuz it sure
[1:00:50] blessed me when I was just thinking
[1:00:51] about he began to paint a picture and
[1:00:53] then something in us just says yes the
[1:00:55] voice of my beloved behold he quickly
[1:00:59] comes
[1:01:00] Hallelujah now I just want to read I
[1:01:03] just want to read a
[1:01:06] quote this
[1:01:10] is now this is from from that
[1:01:14] time as brother Bram going into an
[1:01:17] insane
[1:01:18] institution to pray for
[1:01:20] people he says here some time ago I went
[1:01:23] into an emergency room in a certain
[1:01:25] building and there was supposed to be um
[1:01:29] um the insane when I walked in the door
[1:01:31] there was a lovely pretty young woman
[1:01:33] about 25 years old sitting there looking
[1:01:36] at me I said how do you do and some of
[1:01:39] them in straight jackets and beds um um
[1:01:41] over their faces and cursing and oh
[1:01:43] filled with demon power and I looked at
[1:01:45] her I said well it's kind kindly hard to
[1:01:48] tell where to start praying first she
[1:01:50] said if you don't mind I wish you'd
[1:01:52] start with me I said with you said yes

[1:02:11] young girl brother bam I was raised in a
[1:02:13] real Christian home and I started going
[1:02:16] with a boy that smoked and said the
[1:02:17] first thing you know I was smoking and
[1:02:20] one night he spiked a coke with whiskey
[1:02:22] and that started me drinking and and she
[1:02:24] said I started from that to prostitution
[1:02:27] and she said I lived in the very gutters
[1:02:28] of the blackest hell she said I served
[1:02:31] four years in the Catholic institution

[1:02:55] come home and joined another church I
[1:02:57] told the pastor we went down to the
[1:02:59] Altar and talked it over but she said I

[1:03:28] Lord yet she said yes I have too brother
[1:03:31] brandham I've signed pledges and vows
[1:03:34] and made promises to God and and I said
[1:03:38] that's not what I'm talking
[1:03:40] about I said as oldfashioned it may seem
[1:03:42] to be it's a devil she said I've always
[1:03:45] believed that I said he drives you to do
[1:03:47] things you don't want to do she said I
[1:03:49] believe that and she said where uh uh
[1:03:53] would there be a hope for me me
[1:03:55] certainly and we knelt down to pray and
[1:03:58] after a while she raised up beautiful
[1:03:59] woman great soft looking eyes looked up
[1:04:02] tears running down her cheek she said
[1:04:04] now brother brandham I believe I'm going
[1:04:05] to go out and and and make a new life he

[1:04:27] got down there together and prayed and I
[1:04:29] left her praying went on pray with the
[1:04:31] other people and after a while she rose
[1:04:33] up from there and looked around the room
[1:04:36] those big eyes looking at me she said
[1:04:39] something happened to me I said now

[1:05:12] all my heart Hallelujah I mean there's
[1:05:14] something in people that they just want
[1:05:16] a real life I mean they just want
[1:05:18] something that's wholesome and real and
[1:05:21] but then she said but then who would she
[1:05:23] says but look at at me
[1:05:25] now Look at me
[1:05:28] now and so many time you know she was in
[1:05:31] her state of despair and maybe you're in
[1:05:33] that position just now and you would
[1:05:35] look and you would you know because you
[1:05:37] read the scriptures and you read the you
[1:05:39] know you hear the message and brother BR
[1:05:40] begins to say about how the bride is

[1:05:45] of his power she is him you know they
[1:05:47] are one husband and wife or one great is
[1:05:49] the mystery and you know he's painting a
[1:05:51] picture of this is this is what the
[1:05:52] bride is and and and you know sometimes
[1:05:55] we can look at that then we can look at
[1:05:56] ourselves but then we would think but
[1:05:59] look at me now amen who would you know
[1:06:03] you know why would he take me now I'm in
[1:06:06] no state for him to take me now but
[1:06:08] that's not the you know you know you're
[1:06:10] looking at the wrong thing hallelujah
[1:06:13] amen you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:06:15] you got to just look at what he's
[1:06:17] painting the picture in front of you
[1:06:18] remember God is not mean he doesn't wave
[1:06:21] something in front of you and then when
[1:06:23] you make a mistake gives you a gives you
[1:06:25] a smack gives you a box law he's not
[1:06:26] mean like that but he but he puts
[1:06:29] something in front of you because he
[1:06:30] wants you to become this this is what I
[1:06:33] have in my mind for you to become just
[1:06:35] step into what I have Hallelujah step
[1:06:38] into what I have for you amen and she
[1:06:41] said but you know you know but I've
[1:06:43] tried he said well don't just try and
[1:06:46] turn over a new Leaf stay there till he
[1:06:49] speaks to you amen stay there till he
[1:06:52] speaks to you she got emotion
[1:06:55] sometimes when we think we get emotional
[1:06:56] in prayer we've really we've really got
[1:06:58] through but not all the time amen stay
[1:07:02] there till he speaks to
[1:07:04] you amen hallelujah and she amen she was
[1:07:09] something happened to her that was
[1:07:11] Immortal amen her in her condition she'd
[1:07:15] think there's no way someone would want
[1:07:16] to marry me there's no way I could ever
[1:07:18] be free of this thing that drives me
[1:07:20] around as soon as you recognize it's not
[1:07:23] you that's right you can get rid of it
[1:07:25] but if you take ownership of it well
[1:07:26] that's just my nature this is how I've
[1:07:28] always been you know you the woman at
[1:07:30] the well thought the same kind of thing
[1:07:32] and she had you know six husbands she
[1:07:34] was with another man at that time and
[1:07:36] she was an outcast in her Village you
[1:07:37] know the story very well you know you
[1:07:40] know brother brah repeats it many times
[1:07:41] because he's wanting he's wanting you to
[1:07:43] see now this is the kind of people that
[1:07:45] God is looking for and because she knew
[1:07:48] more of the Bible than the scribes and
[1:07:49] Pharisees did because when he be to tell
[1:07:53] her go get your husband she says I have
[1:07:55] none and then he begins to discern her
[1:07:57] life and says that's right you've had
[1:07:59] five and the one you're wor now is not
[1:08:01] yours you know she be to recognize this
[1:08:04] is more than a man standing in front of
[1:08:05] me and she be to say we know when
[1:08:07] Messiah cometh he'll do these things and
[1:08:10] then so and then so she said he that uh
[1:08:13] he said to her he that speaks to thee am
[1:08:16] he and she didn't debate she didn't fuss
[1:08:18] she didn't say can any good thing come
[1:08:20] out of Nazareth she just believed what
[1:08:22] he said dropped her water ran into the
[1:08:24] village there said come Behold a man
[1:08:26] come see a man that's told me everything
[1:08:28] I ever did is this not the very Messiah
[1:08:31] but yet the scribes and Pharisees they
[1:08:33] heard the same things they saw the same
[1:08:36] things being done they were in the
[1:08:38] meetings amen they were in the meetings
[1:08:40] but they said this is babab have away
[1:08:42] with such a fellow and here was the word
[1:08:44] made flesh and now the voice meant one
[1:08:47] thing very much to one person and it
[1:08:50] changed her entire life where she could
[1:08:52] not break that cycle remember just like
[1:08:54] this woman something in her was driving
[1:08:56] her to do things that she didn't want to
[1:08:58] do it's like you're a prisoner and
[1:09:00] you're being dragged around do this do
[1:09:02] this again and you hate yourself for
[1:09:04] doing it and no doubt she she would lay
[1:09:07] down at night and maybe she thought she
[1:09:09] would found happiness with this man but
[1:09:11] he's different from the other men but
[1:09:14] she ended up in the same predicament
[1:09:16] amen and then in the same predicament
[1:09:18] again and she was driven she was looking
[1:09:20] for the right thing in the wrong places
[1:09:22] then finally real husband showed up says
[1:09:26] I need to go by the way of Samaria and
[1:09:28] he began to speak words amen never a man
[1:09:31] spake like this man Hallelujah and it
[1:09:34] changed her life she never went back to
[1:09:37] that old life again she went into a new
[1:09:40] life and brother Bram tells us that the
[1:09:43] word when it's
[1:09:45] interpreted when it comes to pass it
[1:09:48] becomes light amen so when God said in
[1:09:51] the beginning let there be light it
[1:09:53] wasn't manifested it wasn't light yet
[1:09:55] till it actually became light it was
[1:09:57] just word and then it when it came into
[1:09:59] manifestation then it was light and
[1:10:02] Jesus even said to John the Baptist he
[1:10:04] was a bright and Shining Light and
[1:10:06] you're willing for a season to walk in
[1:10:08] his light what was John the Fulfillment
[1:10:11] of the scripture behold I S before you
[1:10:14] Elijah the prophet the voice of one
[1:10:17] crying in the wilderness to prepare the
[1:10:18] way of the Lord Isaiah I think 40:1 and
[1:10:21] there somewhere the voice of one crying
[1:10:23] in the wilderness he was that scripture
[1:10:25] being made manifest so he was light amen
[1:10:30] amen and
[1:10:32] so now and so and so brother bam tells
[1:10:35] us now when when when Jesus spoke to the
[1:10:38] woman at the well he said that was light
[1:10:41] and it redeemed her amen but it blacked
[1:10:44] out the scribes and Pharisees because
[1:10:46] down in her was a seed of predestination
[1:10:49] and when the light came across its path
[1:10:50] it came to life but the but the scribes
[1:10:53] and Pharisees all they had was
[1:10:54] intellectual knowledge they didn't have
[1:10:56] a seat of predestination so when the
[1:10:58] light came across their path it just
[1:10:59] blacked them out completely that's right
[1:11:02] Hallelujah because one both Heard a
[1:11:04] Voice but one said that's the voice of
[1:11:06] my beloved Hallelujah the other said
[1:11:09] well do away with this Renegade we will
[1:11:12] not have this man rule over us and he is
[1:11:15] the
[1:11:16] word
[1:11:18] hallelujah
[1:11:20] now wait let's just go to let's go back
[1:11:22] to the song of just a little bit
[1:11:26] again
[1:11:28] because the scripture as I said in the
[1:11:31] beginning this Bible is not a book of
[1:11:35] history and then a moral way of living a
[1:11:38] moral code but this but the scripture is
[1:11:41] written in such a way that all the
[1:11:44] scripture is actually prophesying of
[1:11:47] today amen you can find where we are in
[1:11:51] every story in the Bible amen you can
[1:11:54] you go back into Genesis and then how
[1:11:58] God when it says let there be light and
[1:12:00] actually that if you go to the Hebrew it
[1:12:01] says for light to appear and it's
[1:12:04] actually now the whole world's covered
[1:12:06] in darkness and water covers the earth
[1:12:08] and then he says let there be light in
[1:12:10] other words let the light appear and
[1:12:12] then now it's all a separation of the
[1:12:13] darkness now there's the light then he
[1:12:15] separates the water from the land brings
[1:12:17] forth the land and then he brings forth
[1:12:19] the trees and everything there it's
[1:12:20] because the seeds if you go read it the
[1:12:22] seeds of those trees and the all the
[1:12:24] vegetation they already in the Earth but
[1:12:27] they just needed for all the stuff to be
[1:12:28] separated from them that now the light
[1:12:30] can shine and the life can come forth
[1:12:32] and that's exactly you amen you are born
[1:12:35] in this Dark World this is the darkest
[1:12:38] age has ever been but yet there was a
[1:12:40] seed down there and God said let the
[1:12:42] light appear Hallelujah and that's why
[1:12:44] he said arise and shine for thy light
[1:12:46] has come and the glory of the Lord has
[1:12:48] risen upon thee amen hallelujah and so
[1:12:52] you were here in darkness and and then
[1:12:53] God callus a separation he said I want
[1:12:56] that son or daughter to come forth and
[1:12:58] what they should be amen hallelujah and
[1:13:00] then the light shine and then try and
[1:13:02] stop it living try and stop that seed
[1:13:05] living in you you can run like Paul Paul
[1:13:08] tried to persecute the church he saw a
[1:13:10] light he saw stepan oh Steven being
[1:13:13] stoned that was Jesus being made
[1:13:16] manifest in his bride and that never
[1:13:18] left him right amen he was a man under
[1:13:22] under conviction
[1:13:24] but light was shining and then he's on
[1:13:27] the road to Damascus and then the and
[1:13:29] then the True Light Shone upon him who
[1:13:31] art thou Lord I am Jesus whom thou
[1:13:34] persecutest Hallelujah he never Paul was
[1:13:37] never chasing a pillar you supernatural
[1:13:39] being I'm going to put you in prison no
[1:13:42] he was persecuting the true church that
[1:13:45] Jesus was dwelling in amen and so by
[1:13:49] persecuting the people that God was
[1:13:52] dwelling in the body of the Lord he was
[1:13:54] actually having a go at God Amen that's
[1:13:58] how much regard that God puts upon you
[1:14:01] if God dwells in you he's actually
[1:14:03] saying you're my body amen you're part
[1:14:05] of me you're not someone who's just
[1:14:08] coming to church and now have this
[1:14:09] religion no you're part of the Living
[1:14:11] God
[1:14:13] hallelujah you know if someone if
[1:14:15] someone cut my arm I'd be angry at that
[1:14:17] well i' pray but I'd be angry at that
[1:14:19] person I wouldn't trust that person amen
[1:14:22] but if then if someone if someone maybe
[1:14:27] had to go at you I would be angry but I
[1:14:31] might not be as angry because you're not
[1:14:33] part of you're not might you know I
[1:14:34] can't feel the same pain as you as as I
[1:14:37] would I trust this illustration makes
[1:14:39] sense you see and so God now he sees you
[1:14:41] as his
[1:14:43] body
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:46] now so there was
[1:14:49] light now as I said every scripture and
[1:14:52] then so we could spend the next forever
[1:14:56] we can go into David's life we can you
[1:15:00] know we can go into Ezra and Nehemiah in
[1:15:03] the time of restoration and this is a
[1:15:05] time of restoration amen amen you can go
[1:15:08] you can go everywhere in the scripture
[1:15:10] and you can actually bring it into the
[1:15:12] into our day because it's prophesying of
[1:15:15] our day that's why Paul Paul used to
[1:15:18] type he was a typologist and he would
[1:15:21] speak in Hebrews 3 and 4 and he would
[1:15:22] say about how you're paralleling the
[1:15:25] Journey of Israel out of Egypt into the
[1:15:27] promised land speaking it as a Christian
[1:15:29] journey and he speaks about the same
[1:15:30] thing even in Corinthians and then Peter
[1:15:33] would I mean and then he would write to
[1:15:35] Timothy and it's saying the last days
[1:15:37] perilous times will come and he comes
[1:15:38] down he speaks as Jenis and jambus
[1:15:41] withstood Moses so they of repr probite
[1:15:43] mind will resist the truth well who's
[1:15:46] that now then Jenis and jambus with
[1:15:48] stood Moses they were the magicians that
[1:15:50] did the same things that same
[1:15:52] Supernatural signs that Moses did and
[1:15:55] then so now you can you can go back into
[1:15:57] that and he's not just getting
[1:15:58] illustrations and grabbing them and
[1:16:00] putting them in the scripture he's
[1:16:01] actually saying those times will live
[1:16:04] again that's right the people will be
[1:16:06] different but the spirit remember God
[1:16:09] and the devil they take the man away but
[1:16:13] their Spirit remains you take Jesus and
[1:16:16] Judas Judas Judas went to his place
[1:16:20] Jesus went into Glory then now the
[1:16:22] spirit that was in Jesus came and dwelt
[1:16:24] in the church amen and then John says
[1:16:28] that the Antichrist has already come the
[1:16:30] spirit of antichrist he says don't look
[1:16:32] for it to come it's already here working
[1:16:34] among you amen so that same same time
[1:16:38] the Holy Ghost came back the spirit of
[1:16:39] antichrist came back amen and then you
[1:16:42] can go to Cain and Abel and that same
[1:16:44] everything there is being lived out this
[1:16:48] all the speaks of today amen that's
[1:16:52] right and it's that's not not farfetched
[1:16:54] yes that's why that's why you know they
[1:16:56] speak about in Judas how it speaks about
[1:16:58] they've gone the way of balum you know
[1:17:00] you you're on the gain sayings of of
[1:17:03] Kora well then what happened there balum
[1:17:06] you know the who knows the story of
[1:17:08] balum and
[1:17:09] Moab yeah so Israel is journeying they
[1:17:12] go through the land of Moab they wanting
[1:17:14] to go into the promised land Moab the
[1:17:16] king he knows he can't beat them with
[1:17:18] his armies because the Israelites
[1:17:20] defeated other other nations and so he
[1:17:23] finds a prophet that can curse that can
[1:17:25] get God to curse them CU he knows if he
[1:17:27] can get God to curse them then he can
[1:17:29] have Victory so he hires balum of course
[1:17:32] God speaks through balum saying I cannot
[1:17:35] I cannot curse what God has blessed and
[1:17:38] I have blessed and I cannot reverse my
[1:17:39] blessing that's God speaking go read
[1:17:41] numbers 22-25 it's in there and then so
[1:17:45] they even had even even uh even balum
[1:17:49] and God um and and Moses they had the
[1:17:52] same approach to God in terms of
[1:17:54] sacrifice and the spirit of God was
[1:17:56] working in the same places it says in
[1:17:58] there that the spirit of God Came Upon
[1:17:59] balam and he prophesied three times The
[1:18:02] Same Spirit that was on Moses Came Upon
[1:18:04] This false guy who sold his gift for
[1:18:06] money amen and because he couldn't curse
[1:18:09] the people he says well just have a
[1:18:12] feast because you know have a feast
[1:18:15] because Moab remember you came from
[1:18:17] lot's daughters and lot so you're
[1:18:19] related to Israel anyway and so just
[1:18:21] have a feast and marry together then God
[1:18:23] will curse them that's exactly what
[1:18:25] happened then how then and then you come
[1:18:27] into our day you go back into the Dark
[1:18:29] Ages what calls the Dark Ages there
[1:18:31] paganism and Christianity were were
[1:18:33] United together at the Council of NAA
[1:18:36] amen that's right and the same thing the
[1:18:39] same thing you go back into this day the
[1:18:42] Pentecostals come out of Egypt amen they
[1:18:46] were remember the church has journeyed
[1:18:48] as it died remember it died in the days
[1:18:51] of persecution went down Underground in
[1:18:53] the in the Dark Ages but then God said I
[1:18:55] will restore amen amen and then so
[1:18:58] Luther came forth and it was they had
[1:19:01] all they had was just shall live by
[1:19:03] faith amen but that's all they had but
[1:19:06] then now God was restoring back to the
[1:19:08] original and then and then so they came
[1:19:10] out that just shall live by faith and
[1:19:12] then the wesle we know their their
[1:19:14] message was sanctification a method of
[1:19:16] sanctification so they were in the
[1:19:18] desert and then now the gifts were
[1:19:20] restored and then so what was happening
[1:19:23] now is that the Pentecostals now we're
[1:19:25] going to go into the land and brother
[1:19:27] bam speaks about this but what happened
[1:19:30] now is they didn't have the faith that
[1:19:32] they could do it and they died in the
[1:19:34] wilderness amen and now what's happened
[1:19:36] to the Pentecostal Church they've United
[1:19:38] with the world just like Israel did in
[1:19:40] the
[1:19:41] beginning
[1:19:43] amen and then we can go to David as a
[1:19:45] rejected King you can just go through
[1:19:46] all the Old Testament it's all speaking
[1:19:49] of
[1:19:50] today amen that's why you can see the
[1:19:54] things that Nehemiah and isra fought
[1:19:56] against during a time of restoration we
[1:19:57] fight against those same things amen
[1:20:00] David being rejected the things that
[1:20:01] fought against David we're fighting
[1:20:03] against the same things Moses the same
[1:20:06] things
[1:20:09] amen now where were we Revelations
[1:20:11] chapter 1 oh no actually sorry we're in
[1:20:13] Song of Solomon Chapter 2 again then
[1:20:15] we're going to Revelations chapter 1 now
[1:20:18] Jesus says in Matthew 24 now see I want
[1:20:21] to show you here I didn't just pick this
[1:20:23] cuz it sounds nice wasn't it lovely the
[1:20:25] voice of my beloved I trust it means
[1:20:27] more to you than just a nice
[1:20:31] verse but here we have if we go down
[1:20:35] now let's just read it again the voice
[1:20:37] of my beloved behold he cometh leaping
[1:20:40] upon the mountains skipping upon the
[1:20:42] hills my beloved spake and said unto me
[1:20:46] rise up my love my fear one come
[1:20:50] away and then and then and then why ises
[1:20:52] he saying this foro the winter is passed
[1:20:55] the rain is over and
[1:20:57] gone the flowers what comes after winter
[1:21:01] spring yep
[1:21:03] spring the flowers appear on the earth
[1:21:06] the time of singing of birds has come
[1:21:08] and the voice of the turtle which is the
[1:21:10] turtle do if you look in the Hebrew is
[1:21:12] heard in our land the Fig Tree putteth
[1:21:14] forth her green figs and the vines with
[1:21:17] tender grape shall be a good smell Arise
[1:21:20] My Love My Fair one Come Away now let's
[1:21:23] go to Matthew 24 we just gonna have a
[1:21:26] little bit of a Bible study just
[1:21:28] now I'm gonna so I'm going to show you
[1:21:33] what we've just read is actually
[1:21:35] prophecy of
[1:21:37] today yeah just like the Book of Ruth
[1:21:39] you can go into the Book of Ruth you can
[1:21:41] I trust you can find yourself in Ruth
[1:21:42] you go into the Book of Esther exactly
[1:21:44] the same thing what Esther lived out
[1:21:46] we're living out what Ruth lived out
[1:21:48] we're living out you say how can this be
[1:21:51] it's because Naomi t the you we're going
[1:21:53] to get there but Naomi types the you
[1:21:57] know Orthodox Israeli church amen and
[1:22:01] Ruth is the Gentile is the bride and
[1:22:04] then so there comes a season where Naomi
[1:22:07] comes back into her Homeland and then at
[1:22:10] the same time Naomi comes back into her
[1:22:12] Homeland Ruth is coming back as well and
[1:22:14] it's a n you know after the second world
[1:22:17] war there's a stir and there was a stir
[1:22:19] before that now is the time we're going
[1:22:21] to go back into our homeland we we must
[1:22:22] have a nation again speaking of Israel
[1:22:25] first time in over 2,000 years we must
[1:22:27] have a nation what's that Naomi going
[1:22:29] back to her
[1:22:30] Homeland amen and then when she comes
[1:22:32] into her position now that causes Ruth
[1:22:35] remember our inheritance our homeland
[1:22:38] has never been a piece of real estate
[1:22:40] but our homeland is our position in the
[1:22:43] word amen so as now Naomi is going back
[1:22:46] into the Homeland into her inheritance
[1:22:48] then Ruth's Redemption is tied in with
[1:22:51] Naomi amen so now as n so as Israel's
[1:22:54] declared we're now a nation God said God
[1:22:57] comes as the angel of the Lord and
[1:22:59] speaks to his Prophet says take these
[1:23:00] two signs of healing to the Nations amen
[1:23:03] it starts the postor War II healing
[1:23:05] Revival why is that because now a sign
[1:23:08] is being done to attract the attention
[1:23:10] of the people because now the bridegroom
[1:23:12] is coming to declare himself Amen
[1:23:14] brother Ram says I would not Point
[1:23:16] myself to me no way I always appoint you
[1:23:18] to Christ I appoint you to the word and
[1:23:21] that's what a true Messenger will do he
[1:23:22] won't he won't form a following of
[1:23:24] himself but he points to the people to
[1:23:26] the word and that's why when you hear
[1:23:28] the message it reveals Christ in the
[1:23:30] Bible amen and so so so now Naomi is
[1:23:35] coming back Ruth is coming back into her
[1:23:38] position but then now it takes the
[1:23:41] Gentile to come into her position before
[1:23:44] Naomi can fully be redeemed that's right
[1:23:48] amen because he had call the people out
[1:23:50] the Gentiles for his name yes and what
[1:23:52] does that mean he will call the people
[1:23:54] of Gentiles to marry them to be United
[1:23:57] with them amen amen and then so here's
[1:24:01] Ruth as a moabitas and now she finds
[1:24:04] herself in the field of Boaz now I'm
[1:24:07] just I'm probably saying too much in a
[1:24:09] very short time but I want you to see
[1:24:11] that the scripture is not just a story
[1:24:14] this Bible is not a bunch of stories but
[1:24:16] it's actually speaking of you it's
[1:24:18] speaking of Christ in you it's speaking
[1:24:20] of Redemption all the way down through
[1:24:22] amen amen it's speaking what the devil
[1:24:24] did back there he does today and then
[1:24:26] you can you can say what is the enemy
[1:24:28] doing in my life go back into the Bible
[1:24:31] and then if you can identify him there
[1:24:32] you'll be able to see what he's doing
[1:24:34] here that's right amen that's why that's
[1:24:36] why brother R says when the seals are
[1:24:37] open it it not only reveals Christ but
[1:24:40] it exposes The Works of the devil all
[1:24:43] the way
[1:24:44] down Hallelujah so we're not walking in
[1:24:46] darkness we know what the enemy is doing
[1:24:49] but most of all we know what our
[1:24:50] bridegroom is doing amen amen and so now
[1:24:54] she comes into the field of Boaz and I
[1:24:57] know you know the story if not go read
[1:24:58] it but then now Boaz is a mighty man of
[1:25:01] wealth he is he is from the lineage of
[1:25:03] Judah you know and so he redeems Naomi
[1:25:08] to get Ruth amen so at the cross now he
[1:25:12] he redeemed Israel to get us that the
[1:25:15] blessing would go on to us amen and then
[1:25:18] now but there came a time now where not
[1:25:20] only that he would pay the price but he
[1:25:21] would lay claim on Ruth marry her have a
[1:25:25] child by her and then now the child that
[1:25:27] son was now given back to Naomi amen
[1:25:31] what do well what does that mean it
[1:25:32] means now that when God produces himself
[1:25:36] in his bride amen as not just gifts not
[1:25:41] just a part of himself but he'll produce
[1:25:43] himself a life will be produced amen oh
[1:25:46] my amen when that life is produced then
[1:25:50] however it happens that that life will
[1:25:51] be passed back back to the Jews because
[1:25:53] the scripture tells us that in one day a
[1:25:55] whole nation will be born amen that
[1:25:57] he'll come and they'll say where did you
[1:25:59] get those wounds he said in the house of
[1:26:01] my friends and there will be a person
[1:26:03] apart weeping and wailing recognize they
[1:26:05] had crucified the Messiah amen but but
[1:26:08] it's just like Joseph Joseph told his
[1:26:10] brothers he said you sold me into
[1:26:12] slavery that life would be saved amen
[1:26:15] and we can go into the life of Joseph as
[1:26:17] well and then Joseph went down to Egypt
[1:26:19] and he married a gentile bride and when
[1:26:22] she's in the palace and he reveals
[1:26:24] himself to his Brethren so when we're up
[1:26:26] at the wedding supper he comes down to
[1:26:27] Israel and he reveals himself amen it's
[1:26:31] all being lived
[1:26:33] out you look why is this world why are
[1:26:37] the economics of this world falling
[1:26:38] apart God's in control that's right God
[1:26:42] caused a famine remember you got to see
[1:26:45] what's
[1:26:46] happening and then look into the Bible
[1:26:48] and you'll see what's happening you'll
[1:26:50] be able to understand what's going on in
[1:26:51] your life Life by looking into the word
[1:26:54] amen amen it's not by trying to work it
[1:26:56] out in your own mind you got to try and
[1:26:58] look into the scripture and see cuz
[1:26:59] there will be a character in The Bible a
[1:27:02] circumstance in the Bible that you will
[1:27:04] see yourself
[1:27:06] in amen and you have to see it that way
[1:27:09] because if they lived out if they were
[1:27:11] prophesying of you how they were
[1:27:13] victorious you'll be victorious amen
[1:27:16] what what they're fighting against
[1:27:18] you'll you'll fight against and overcome
[1:27:20] amen and so now Joseph remember there
[1:27:23] was a famine there why was the famine
[1:27:24] there because God had to get Israel back
[1:27:27] had to get them from there and back from
[1:27:29] the promised land and had to get them
[1:27:30] down into Egypt so the economics of the
[1:27:33] world were falling apart and Joseph
[1:27:35] actually orchestrated the whole thing
[1:27:37] that the Egyptians basically ow Nothing
[1:27:40] by the end of the
[1:27:41] famine yeah because they ran out of food
[1:27:44] and then they gave their money they ran
[1:27:45] out of money then they gave their
[1:27:46] livestock and then they basically sold
[1:27:49] their land to him you go read the story
[1:27:51] so all the economics of the whole world
[1:27:53] were orchestrated by
[1:27:56] Joseph amen and that was all done that
[1:28:00] his his whole family would come down
[1:28:03] amen into Egypt cuz they had to be there
[1:28:05] CU there was a prophecy that they had to
[1:28:07] be there 400 years and then they' be
[1:28:09] delivered with a mighty hand and go back
[1:28:11] into the promised land amen I trust I
[1:28:14] trust you're following me but there's
[1:28:15] all these things it's not just stories
[1:28:17] I'm not just trying to say oh I know all
[1:28:19] these no it's not what it's about but if
[1:28:21] you can see yourself in character you
[1:28:22] can see how to overcome amen cuz if they
[1:28:24] overcame you're sure going to overcome
[1:28:27] amen amen that's why you delight
[1:28:29] yourself in the Lord amen cuz you can
[1:28:32] I'm sure you can see yourself in that
[1:28:33] scripture and then you can see David
[1:28:36] overcame and then what you've overcome
[1:28:39] am amen delight yourself in the law amen
[1:28:42] amen so Matthew sorry
[1:28:46] 24 now we read in Song of Solomon the
[1:28:51] fig tree put forth her green figs and
[1:28:54] the vines with a tender grape give a
[1:28:55] good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and
[1:28:57] come
[1:28:58] away it says for the winter has passed
[1:29:01] the rain is over and gone the flowers
[1:29:03] appear on the earth at
[1:29:06] Springtime now Matthew
[1:29:09] 24:32 Jesus speaking of the time of the
[1:29:11] end yeah I'm I'm basically going to put
[1:29:14] Song of Solomon I'm going to bring it
[1:29:15] into here amen it's speaking about the
[1:29:18] same thing now learn a parable of the
[1:29:20] Fig Tree we just read about a fig tree
[1:29:23] when his branch is yet tender he putteth
[1:29:25] forth leaves you know that summer is
[1:29:28] nigh likewise ye when ye shall see all
[1:29:32] these things know that it is near even
[1:29:35] at the doors verely I say unto you this
[1:29:39] generation shall not pass till all these
[1:29:42] things be
[1:29:45] fulfilled now what well what is the Fig
[1:29:48] Tre now the safe time we won't read it
[1:29:50] but go read Jeremiah chapter 24 if
[1:29:52] you're taking notes he sees a vision of
[1:29:54] two baskets of figs do you remind us and
[1:29:57] one is a good one one is a good basket
[1:30:00] of good figs and the other basket is
[1:30:02] actually called Naughty figs evil figs
[1:30:06] and the interpretation of was the basket
[1:30:07] of good figs they'll all be sent into
[1:30:10] you know they'll all be taken away into
[1:30:11] captivity but the Bas of good figs will
[1:30:14] return again and you go read the chapter
[1:30:16] because it interprets it I'm not just
[1:30:17] making this up but then the naughty figs
[1:30:19] they'll be taken into captivity but then
[1:30:21] they'll be scattered never return again
[1:30:24] Jeremiah CH
[1:30:25] 24 yeah so figs in the scripture is
[1:30:28] Israel in
[1:30:30] Prophecy
[1:30:32] amen and you can even go into
[1:30:34] Nebuchadnezzar I think it is in Daniel
[1:30:36] and he is actually referred to as a big
[1:30:39] tree amen and that's actually speaking
[1:30:42] of his
[1:30:43] kingdom yeah are you all following me
[1:30:45] amen amen and then so now when the Fig
[1:30:49] Tree puts forth its Branch it's actually
[1:30:50] when a nation is is growing
[1:30:53] again you know that summer is night so
[1:30:55] when an Israeli nation is growing again
[1:30:58] amen oh haven't we seen that happen
[1:31:01] Hallelujah you know that summer is night
[1:31:03] that's what he's saying he's not just
[1:31:05] Jesus just doesn't throw things out
[1:31:07] there then you have to guess it
[1:31:08] interprets itself the word interprets
[1:31:10] itself and then so when you see that
[1:31:13] happen you know summer is night what
[1:31:14] does he speaking of a summer he's
[1:31:16] speaking of a
[1:31:17] millennium amen he's speaking of a
[1:31:19] Redemption he's speaking of you know
[1:31:20] eventually a new heavens new Earth after
[1:31:22] that he says so this generation shall
[1:31:25] not pass till all these things be
[1:31:28] fulfilled he's not speaking of the
[1:31:30] generation of of the Apostles there like
[1:31:33] people you know I picked up a book in
[1:31:34] wiill one time and they said about
[1:31:37] failed end of the world prophecies and
[1:31:39] they took this scripture and said
[1:31:41] Matthew had a false end time prophecy no
[1:31:43] they just don't understand what they're
[1:31:45] reading cuz he says this generation not
[1:31:48] the generation that Jesus is speaking to
[1:31:50] there Peter James and John on but the
[1:31:52] generation that sees Israel become a
[1:31:55] nation and that's
[1:31:58] happened amen so now the Song of Solomon
[1:32:02] what we just read is coming into our day
[1:32:04] yes I trust it's not just stories I'm so
[1:32:07] glad it's not just
[1:32:09] stories amen
[1:32:11] so now wait let's just go back there
[1:32:13] Song of Solomon how have
[1:32:17] done so now the voice of my beloved
[1:32:22] behold he cometh leaping upon the
[1:32:24] mountain skipping upon the
[1:32:26] hills my beloved is like a roow or a
[1:32:29] young heart behold he standeth upon our
[1:32:31] wall he lookth forth at the windows
[1:32:33] showing himself through the lettuce
[1:32:35] what's a lettuce you know it's like a
[1:32:37] you know a lettuce you can't quite see
[1:32:38] the whole depends how tipe the lettuce
[1:32:40] is built you can't see the whole picture
[1:32:44] amen unless you put your eye really
[1:32:45] through the hole so we see him because
[1:32:51] we're in the these bodies we don't see
[1:32:53] him really as he is but when we shall
[1:32:56] see him we'll be like him the scripture
[1:32:57] says amen see we've heard of heaven we
[1:33:01] know God's real because we feel his
[1:33:03] presence and he's changed our lives amen
[1:33:05] amen we know that it's not us and our
[1:33:08] Humanity being Believers but we know
[1:33:10] it's him in us doing it that's against
[1:33:12] even what I want in spite of what I
[1:33:14] wanted in life I'm a Believer well how
[1:33:17] did that happen I just yielded my will
[1:33:19] to him and then let him do what he wants
[1:33:21] to do
[1:33:22] and so we don't you know we don't see
[1:33:24] pillars of fire you know in the meeting
[1:33:26] God's presence like that some people do
[1:33:29] many don't it's like brother bam in the
[1:33:31] service he says can't you see that light
[1:33:33] over that person not everyone could
[1:33:36] because it was in another
[1:33:37] realm amen it was in that realm that
[1:33:40] only a prophet can
[1:33:42] see but yet we feel his presence it's
[1:33:45] like a blind man he's never seen the Sun
[1:33:47] but he feels the sun rais and it takes
[1:33:50] someone who can see to say that's the
[1:33:51] the sun affecting you like that and then
[1:33:53] we may not be able to see him remember
[1:33:55] these angels here the spirit of God is
[1:33:58] here all of Heaven is is here in this
[1:34:00] room Hallelujah just think of it oh I
[1:34:02] want to see him and he's here amen but
[1:34:05] we don't he's veiled behind flesh and we
[1:34:08] can't see the angels in the other realm
[1:34:10] but they're here amen amen what is that
[1:34:14] you know you just going through your
[1:34:16] daily life and just a thought slips into
[1:34:18] your heart just about him just just out
[1:34:21] of
[1:34:22] what is that that's God amen amen so we
[1:34:26] may not see him and see the Angels but
[1:34:28] the word tells us angels are here we
[1:34:30] could say welcome Angels where do you
[1:34:32] want to sit amen we could cuz the word
[1:34:35] says they're here but yet we don't see
[1:34:37] them but yet we feel the effects of the
[1:34:39] spirit of God
[1:34:42] hallelujah now that so that's why we're
[1:34:45] looking through a lettuce we don't see
[1:34:47] him perfectly as he is amen but when we
[1:34:51] see him when he fin finishes his coming
[1:34:54] and we see him then we shall be like him
[1:34:57] oh hallelujah amen Now Behold so my
[1:35:00] beloved spake remember God God's
[1:35:04] relationship with his bride is
[1:35:06] intimate amen there's something as I
[1:35:08] said in the beginning there's something
[1:35:09] about his voice that speaks speaks to
[1:35:13] you but it's the same thing with husband
[1:35:15] and wife there's something about your
[1:35:17] spouse's voice that's very different to
[1:35:20] every other voice I trust you can say
[1:35:22] amen I would be talking to Christine on
[1:35:24] the phone this is when we were just
[1:35:25] quing and I'd just be crying because
[1:35:28] there was something in her voice that
[1:35:30] just moved me this is
[1:35:32] true Hallelujah that's true there's
[1:35:35] something in her voice that just moved
[1:35:37] me like no other woman's voice had moved
[1:35:40] me amen it's the same thing with the
[1:35:42] voice of God there's something in the
[1:35:44] voice of God that moves the bride like
[1:35:47] only his voice
[1:35:49] can Hallelujah Hallelujah that's true
[1:35:53] because God is very intimate amen
[1:35:57] hallelujah that's why we can say this is
[1:35:58] a love letter oh my now the flowers
[1:36:02] appear on the earth So speaking of
[1:36:04] Springtime and then verse 13 the Fig Tre
[1:36:06] put forth her green figs and the vines
[1:36:09] do tender grapes which are good which
[1:36:11] are a good smell Arise My Love so now
[1:36:13] now is the season Arise My Love My Fair
[1:36:17] one and come away Hallelujah so you
[1:36:20] seeing now when when the Fig Tree put
[1:36:22] forth his buds now is the time where he
[1:36:24] says Arise My Love my fear one come away
[1:36:28] what is that that is the rapture I can't
[1:36:31] stand it anymore you must Arise My Fair
[1:36:33] one Hallelujah and then now let's go to
[1:36:36] Psalms chapter
[1:36:39] 27
[1:36:44] amen I trust you don't mind all the
[1:36:47] reading but you see it's not when so the
[1:36:50] song of Solomon it's the voice of the
[1:36:52] Beloved that moves the bride amen and it
[1:36:56] causes the bride to come away amen amen
[1:36:59] and there's something and there'll be
[1:37:01] something when he when he when the dead
[1:37:03] in Christ rise these bodies are changed
[1:37:05] and he calls us up there'll just be
[1:37:07] something in us that we can't resist it
[1:37:09] amen amen you you know you won't say oh
[1:37:12] Lord but what about this you'll say he's
[1:37:15] called The Master's called I must go
[1:37:18] Hallelujah there's nothing holding me
[1:37:20] here
[1:37:21] hallelujah hallelujah amen now so psalms
[1:37:24] 27 and we this is very significant this
[1:37:27] chapter because brother brandom at the
[1:37:29] end of his ministry when he preaches on
[1:37:31] the divine order of the Rapture he
[1:37:33] doesn't go to first Thessalonians 4
[1:37:35] first but he opens his sermon with
[1:37:38] Psalms chapter 27 so and this speaks of
[1:37:42] the condition of the believer that is
[1:37:45] ready to go in the Rapture that's right
[1:37:49] amen the Lord is my light and my
[1:37:53] salvation Whom Shall I Fear hallu tell
[1:37:58] me what can I should I fear this world
[1:38:01] should I fear the all of Hell amen I got
[1:38:05] nothing to fear Whom Shall I Fear amen
[1:38:08] the Lord is the strength of my life he
[1:38:12] is my he is your strength I can't go on
[1:38:15] he's your strength amen
[1:38:17] hallelujah of whom shall I be afraid I
[1:38:21] lose my job I lose everything don't be
[1:38:23] afraid amen Don't Be Afraid of
[1:38:26] Anything Hallelujah when the wicked even
[1:38:31] my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to
[1:38:33] eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell
[1:38:37] now I know I've said this before but
[1:38:38] there was a time in life when you the
[1:38:41] enemy came against you just like the
[1:38:43] woman read about in the quote and we can
[1:38:45] go to um maybe will in Ephesians chapter
[1:38:48] 2 and show you but he says he says in
[1:38:50] Ephesians 2 too but you were you have he
[1:38:53] quickened yes who are Once Dead in
[1:38:55] trespasses and sins who used to walk
[1:38:57] according to the power the prince of the
[1:38:59] a the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:39:02] children of Disobedience so he said one
[1:39:04] time you walked according to the spirit
[1:39:06] in this world one time you did but he's
[1:39:09] quickened you that you're no longer
[1:39:11] under the headship of this world you're
[1:39:13] under the headship of God himself amen
[1:39:16] so one time that Spirit drove you did
[1:39:18] all kinds of things why do people not
[1:39:20] have peace you see I feel sorry for
[1:39:22] people like Prince who's gone to his
[1:39:24] reward other people like if if their
[1:39:27] lifestyle is so wonderful why are why
[1:39:30] the vast majority of them have to go
[1:39:32] through rehab or die of drug
[1:39:34] overdoses what if it's such a wonderful
[1:39:37] life why do they end up in that
[1:39:40] condition amen if it was such a
[1:39:42] wonderful life they'd never end up in
[1:39:43] that condition but you see they have no
[1:39:46] peace they're tormented I feel sorry for
[1:39:48] them they're
[1:39:49] slaves amen why did Elvis dive a drug
[1:39:52] overdose and so many because they were
[1:39:55] tormented with the because the devil had
[1:39:59] they have gave themselves to it number
[1:40:01] one but then now they're in Chains and
[1:40:03] they dragged through life doing certain
[1:40:06] things if it was a wonderful life they
[1:40:08] wouldn't have to try and Escape it by
[1:40:10] substances and all different kinds of
[1:40:13] things
[1:40:15] amen so now so there was a time when the
[1:40:19] wicked even your enemies Came Upon me
[1:40:21] eat up your flesh you stumbled and fell
[1:40:23] there was a time I know there was a time
[1:40:25] in my life but it's very different now
[1:40:28] when the life of God comes into you when
[1:40:30] your enemy comes against you he stumbles
[1:40:32] on Falls Hallelujah he stumbles on Falls
[1:40:37] Hallelujah and though host should encamp
[1:40:40] against me my heart shall not fear
[1:40:43] though War should rise against me in
[1:40:46] this will I be confident Hallelujah I'll
[1:40:49] be confident in this one thing here's a
[1:40:51] was confident in one thing he was
[1:40:53] restoring the kingdom to worship God
[1:40:57] hallelujah and he had a confidence that
[1:40:59] God would not let him fall because he
[1:41:02] was standing for God and to me I love
[1:41:05] the story because the enemy comes along
[1:41:07] says look all the places we have we have
[1:41:09] taken and the Devil comes along and no
[1:41:11] doubt will come to and say look at all
[1:41:13] these denominations that we have taken
[1:41:15] amen look at all these places we've been
[1:41:18] we've got the Presbyterian we've sure
[1:41:20] got the Catholic we got everyone under
[1:41:22] Heaven they're walking in darkness well
[1:41:24] they being bound to the mother whall I
[1:41:26] know it's strong words but it's Bible
[1:41:27] language they are where they like or not
[1:41:29] and it's not the people it's the system
[1:41:31] dragging the people there many good
[1:41:33] people but they just have to come out
[1:41:35] cuz that's what it says in Revelations
[1:41:36] 18 come out of her my people and be not
[1:41:39] partaker of her sins Hallelujah and so
[1:41:43] the You Know The Enemy can say look at
[1:41:45] all these places we've been and we've
[1:41:47] taken every one of them they started off
[1:41:49] walking in the light but then they made
[1:41:51] a denomination put God in a box and now
[1:41:53] they've become a trophy on the devil's
[1:41:55] wall but then now there's a people
[1:41:58] hallelujah Jerusalem amen who have stood
[1:42:02] under the word and they know the devil
[1:42:04] cannot take them Hallelujah they know
[1:42:07] the devil has no right to come on their
[1:42:09] ground Hallelujah and then that's why
[1:42:11] Hezekiah could
[1:42:12] stand hallelujah hallelujah amen and
[1:42:16] that's why Hezekiah could stand and and
[1:42:19] God he didn't have to fight anything I
[1:42:21] just came down I'm going to show my
[1:42:23] power Hallelujah don't be scared if the
[1:42:25] devil's pinned you into a quarter God
[1:42:27] wants to show us power God wants to show
[1:42:30] something in your life to display
[1:42:32] himself don't be worried Hallelujah of
[1:42:35] Whom Shall I Fear th host should encamps
[1:42:37] against me my heart should not fear that
[1:42:39] war should rise against me in this will
[1:42:41] I be confident one thing I have desired
[1:42:43] of the Lord that I will seek after that
[1:42:45] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:42:47] the days of my life to
[1:42:51] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:42:53] inquire in his Temple we know that does
[1:42:54] the house of the Lord doesn't mean this
[1:42:56] building amen it means going into the
[1:42:58] holy of holies becoming one with him
[1:43:02] amen for in the time of trouble and it
[1:43:04] sure is a time of trouble he should hide
[1:43:06] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[1:43:08] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:43:11] me up upon a rock and then Jesus said to
[1:43:14] the disciples Upon This Rock I'll build
[1:43:16] my church and if you read the chapter
[1:43:19] the rock is not Jesus the rock is not
[1:43:21] Peter the rock of is the revelation of
[1:43:23] who Jesus Christ is blessed art thou
[1:43:26] Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood is
[1:43:28] not revealed this to thee but my Father
[1:43:30] in Heaven has revealed it what was it
[1:43:32] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:43:34] Living God and Upon This Rock the
[1:43:36] spiritual revelation of who Jesus is in
[1:43:39] his season amen that is the rock
[1:43:42] everyone can say Jesus died on Calvary
[1:43:44] that's just a historical fact but when
[1:43:46] God comes upon the scene in your
[1:43:48] generation you have to see him as he
[1:43:51] is amen that's been the challenge all
[1:43:54] the way down through why would it be
[1:43:56] different now Paul even wrote them that
[1:43:59] are spiritual among you let them
[1:44:01] acknowledge that the Commandments I
[1:44:02] teach you are the Commandments of the
[1:44:03] Lord there was a challenge now all we
[1:44:06] believe in Jesus we know the holy
[1:44:07] spirit's come but what's these letters
[1:44:09] Paul are writing yes they had to
[1:44:12] actually acknowledge God was using Paul
[1:44:14] to lay Place Christ and Grace and all
[1:44:17] these different things positionally
[1:44:18] place the Bible yes amen they had to
[1:44:21] acknowledge it and all the way down has
[1:44:23] to be the same thing amen you know you
[1:44:26] know the scribes and Pharisees they said
[1:44:27] we are Moses
[1:44:29] disciples and Jesus said if you had
[1:44:31] known Moses you'd know me CU because
[1:44:33] Moses wrote Of Me amen but they didn't
[1:44:36] know Moses they recognize the one Moses
[1:44:38] was writing about so this rock is always
[1:44:41] the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:44:43] season that the people are alive in amen
[1:44:47] I trust that's not too that well we'll
[1:44:50] come to that later and now shall my head
[1:44:53] be lifted up actually I'll just mention
[1:44:55] it now at the end of the church Ages
[1:44:57] Every Church age Revelations 2 and three
[1:44:59] to him that hath an ear let him hear
[1:45:01] what the spirit speaks not has spoken
[1:45:04] but speaks to the churches amen so God
[1:45:07] is speaking through every age from
[1:45:09] Calvary down to now God is speaking and
[1:45:12] him that has an ear amen oh Hallelujah
[1:45:15] him that has an ear let him hear what
[1:45:17] the spirit is
[1:45:18] speaking but we understand that the
[1:45:20] truth true voice of God will not deviate
[1:45:22] from the work that's
[1:45:24] right
[1:45:26] amen and now shall my head be lifted up
[1:45:29] above my enemies round about me
[1:45:31] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:45:33] sacrifices of Joy I will sing y sing
[1:45:36] praises unto the Lord
[1:45:39] now here oh God when I cry with my voice
[1:45:43] have mercy also upon me and answer me
[1:45:46] now listen when thou
[1:45:48] sest seek ye my face arise remember
[1:45:52] arise my fear and come away seek ye my
[1:45:55] face my heart said unto thee thy face
[1:45:58] Lord will I seek there's something in
[1:46:02] The Believer when God speaks to them
[1:46:05] it's actually the remember the heart is
[1:46:07] the is the seat of the affections as a
[1:46:09] man thinketh in his heart so is he so
[1:46:12] it's not in here it's in here something
[1:46:13] in here responds back to his voice and
[1:46:16] says your face Lord will I seek yes I me
[1:46:20] so when he speaks the you know when the
[1:46:22] voice of my of of your beloved comes
[1:46:24] your way there's something in here that
[1:46:26] responds Hallelujah that's why it's an
[1:46:29] intimate walk it's not a just a head
[1:46:32] knowledge thing
[1:46:34] Hallelujah hide not thy face far from me
[1:46:38] put not thy uh servant away in Anger
[1:46:41] thou Hast been my help leave me not
[1:46:43] neither forsake me oh god of my
[1:46:47] salvation when my father and my mother
[1:46:49] for uh uh forsake me then the Lord will
[1:46:53] take me up and if you forsake father and
[1:46:56] mother for my sake I'll give you father
[1:46:57] mother husband land you know as teach me
[1:47:01] thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in the plain
[1:47:04] path because of mine enemies Deliver Me
[1:47:07] Not Over unto the will of my enemies for
[1:47:10] false Witnesses are risen up against me
[1:47:13] and such as breathe out
[1:47:16] cruelty I had fainted unless I had

[1:47:22] Lord and be of good courage and he shall
[1:47:25] strengthen thine heart wait I say on the
[1:47:28] Lord you see this is a time of trouble
[1:47:31] we are not comfortable in this world
[1:47:33] right God doesn't want us
[1:47:35] comfortable if you've ever wondered why
[1:47:38] is the world falling apart because he
[1:47:40] wants us to anything holding us here he
[1:47:43] wants to break it free now that doesn't
[1:47:46] mean quit your job live in the hills and
[1:47:47] make a monastery I'm not talking about
[1:47:49] that we're in this world world but we're
[1:47:50] not of the of this world
[1:47:54] Amen so he's he's speaking here so so
[1:47:57] notice I want to just get to that verse
[1:47:59] mainly in verse eight seeky my when when
[1:48:02] thou said seek ye my face my heart said
[1:48:05] unto thee thy face Lord will I seek
[1:48:08] because it's now the voice means
[1:48:10] more the voice of God to the believer
[1:48:13] means more to the believer than than
[1:48:15] than anything that's right amen amen
[1:48:19] hallelujah now we got to Revelations
[1:48:21] chapter 1 and then we'll I'm sorry time
[1:48:22] has slipped
[1:48:26] away now
[1:48:28] John I'm just going to drop this in but
[1:48:32] John let's just read from verse
[1:48:37] one the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[1:48:40] God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:48:42] servants things was must shortly come to
[1:48:46] pass and he sent and signified it by his
[1:48:49] Angel unto his servant John who bear a
[1:48:52] record of the word of God and of the
[1:48:54] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the
[1:48:56] things that he saw blessed is he that
[1:48:58] readeth and that hear the words of this
[1:49:00] prophecy and keep those things which are
[1:49:03] written therein for the time is at
[1:49:06] hand
[1:49:10] now I want to okay let's let's just drop
[1:49:16] down well actually let's just keep
[1:49:18] reading John to the seven churches which
[1:49:20] are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace
[1:49:22] from from him which is which was and
[1:49:25] which is to come and from the seven
[1:49:27] spirits which are before his
[1:49:29] throne and from Jesus Christ who is a
[1:49:32] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:49:34] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[1:49:35] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[1:49:38] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[1:49:40] and has made us Kings and Priests unto
[1:49:42] God and his father to him be glory and
[1:49:44] Dominion forever and ever amen behold he
[1:49:47] cometh with clouds and every eye shall
[1:49:48] see him and they which also pierced him
[1:49:51] and all kindreds of the Earth shall
[1:49:53] whail because of him even so amen now
[1:49:55] remember this this every eye shall see
[1:49:58] that's not the Rapture because he comes
[1:49:59] like a thief of the night and a bad
[1:50:01] thief causes everyone to see him amen
[1:50:04] but he says I'll come like a thief of
[1:50:05] the night so this is not when he comes
[1:50:07] for his bride this is when he comes to
[1:50:09] Israel amen I am Alpha and Omega the
[1:50:13] beginning and the ending sayith the Lord
[1:50:15] which is which was and which shall to
[1:50:17] come the almighty and I John who who
[1:50:20] also am your brother and companion in
[1:50:22] Tribulation and in the kingdom and
[1:50:24] patience of Jesus Christ was in the
[1:50:26] aisle that is called Patmos for the word
[1:50:28] of God and for the testimony of Jesus
[1:50:31] Christ now I was in the spirit on the
[1:50:33] Lord's day and heard behind me as a
[1:50:36] great voice as of a
[1:50:38] trumpet now
[1:50:40] John this book The Book of Revelation is
[1:50:44] a book of Prophecy which we've also read
[1:50:47] and then it's also a book of symbols
[1:50:50] that's right yeah because he he has told
[1:50:53] what you see so this is verse 19 write
[1:50:56] the things which thou H has seen and the
[1:50:58] things which are and the things which
[1:50:59] shall be
[1:51:01] Hereafter and he's told to write it oh
[1:51:05] sorry verse 11 saying I'm Alpha and
[1:51:07] Omega the first and the last what thou
[1:51:09] seeth write in a book and send it unto
[1:51:11] the seven churches which are in Asia
[1:51:13] remember those churches in Asia are
[1:51:15] Gentile churches in the southwestern
[1:51:17] part of of turkey there not so it's not
[1:51:20] it's not addressed to the churches in
[1:51:21] Jerusalem the Israel uh the Jewish
[1:51:23] churches it's speaking to
[1:51:25] Gentiles so John so what you see WR in a
[1:51:29] book so when he sees a horse rider or he
[1:51:31] sees something that's what he sees and
[1:51:33] he writes it down so it's a book of
[1:51:35] Prophecy but it's also symbolic but now
[1:51:39] John says John in verse 10 says I in the
[1:51:42] spirit on the Lord's day now the Lord's
[1:51:44] day is not
[1:51:46] Sunday amen but we gather on Sunday
[1:51:49] because it was the day after the Sabbath
[1:51:51] Jesus arose just to honor the
[1:51:52] resurrection but the Lord's day is not a
[1:51:55] Sunday the Lord's day is after the
[1:51:59] church ages are over amen so so it's
[1:52:02] during the Great Tribulation that is the
[1:52:05] day of the Lord because if you read
[1:52:06] about Jacob's trouble and all the other
[1:52:08] Prophecies of the day of the Lord it's a
[1:52:11] great day of Vengeance of our God it's
[1:52:12] when his wrath is poured out that is the
[1:52:14] day of the Lord that's after the church
[1:52:16] is raptured that is the day of the
[1:52:18] Lord and so so so John so John's there
[1:52:22] on Patmos but he's actually been
[1:52:23] transported into the day of the Lord
[1:52:26] amen by vision and then I was in the
[1:52:29] spirit on the Lord's day and I heard
[1:52:31] behind me a great voice as a trumpet so
[1:52:35] then now we're not you know read the
[1:52:37] whole thing but just the same time so
[1:52:39] here's John here's John and he he's a on
[1:52:42] the Lord's day and he hears a great
[1:52:45] voice behind him as a trumpet so he
[1:52:47] turns around because the voice is behind
[1:52:49] him
[1:52:51] and then he sees one standing in the
[1:52:53] midst of the golden um uh in the midst
[1:52:57] of the seven candlesticks that's that's
[1:53:00] verse 13 so he turns around and he sees
[1:53:02] one like the son of man standing in the
[1:53:04] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:53:06] and that seven golden candlesticks or
[1:53:08] actually lampstands they are the seven
[1:53:10] speak of the seven churches which are
[1:53:13] periods of time from Calvary to now so
[1:53:18] John and I'm not sure how I'm going to
[1:53:19] get it uh uh wind this up but so John is
[1:53:22] here in the Lord's day he turns around
[1:53:25] and he sees the son of man Christ
[1:53:27] glorified in the midst of the Gentile
[1:53:29] churches which is the church ages so now
[1:53:33] John is here but then he turns around
[1:53:35] and he now he begins to tell and see
[1:53:38] what God has been doing from Calvary
[1:53:42] into where he
[1:53:43] is yeah so John now John is
[1:53:48] not where when when John is recorded in
[1:53:51] the Book of Revelation he's not speaking
[1:53:53] of himself but he is a
[1:53:55] symbol amen he is symbolic of a group of
[1:53:59] people and I'll show you that in a
[1:54:01] second so now here's a group of people
[1:54:03] that are at the end of the end of the
[1:54:05] church ages and what happens at the end
[1:54:07] of the church age there's a voice of my
[1:54:09] beloved says behold my my fair one come
[1:54:12] away amen there's a Rapture takes place
[1:54:14] that's right I mean so they hear a voice
[1:54:16] arise my fear one come away so he's
[1:54:18] there now basically you are John in the
[1:54:22] Book of Revelation go tell John amen
[1:54:25] amen you are John in the Book of
[1:54:26] Revelation and then so now you are there
[1:54:29] and then he shows you in the Book of
[1:54:31] Revelation what he has been doing for
[1:54:32] seven Church
[1:54:34] ages amen that's why that's why he's
[1:54:37] here and he hear a voice behind him
[1:54:39] that's unusual because normally the
[1:54:40] angel appears in front of a person
[1:54:42] normally if you go talk to someone you
[1:54:43] you you you look them in the face hey
[1:54:45] you don't nor come behind them say Hey
[1:54:48] you know but it's because John is
[1:54:50] actually in in time but a future event
[1:54:53] from where he is and then so he's called
[1:54:55] now and he looks and he sees Christ
[1:54:58] among the seven
[1:54:59] churches and then now the Book of
[1:55:01] Revelation is he God begins to show John
[1:55:04] this is what I've been doing and
[1:55:07] now so he's showing you remember the I I
[1:55:11] wanted to bring this out because
[1:55:12] remember this is not many people think
[1:55:13] Old Testament History New Testament
[1:55:15] moral code book of Revelation scary I
[1:55:17] don't know that's normally it
[1:55:20] but this book is a special book amen
[1:55:24] because it tells where you're going and
[1:55:26] where you're from where the devil's
[1:55:28] going and where he's going where he's
[1:55:31] from and he's well he's he's going to
[1:55:33] leg of fire anyway that's what I mean
[1:55:34] you know and so God's written this in
[1:55:37] such a way remember the voice of God is
[1:55:40] special to the bride it's a very special
[1:55:43] thing and so now John now God Jesus
[1:55:46] Remember The Book of Revelation is not
[1:55:48] the revelation of John the Divine like I
[1:55:50] have in my Bible cuz chapter one says
[1:55:52] the revelation of Jesus Christ that's
[1:55:54] right so it is actually the only book in
[1:55:57] the scripture that Jesus actually writes
[1:55:59] but through a
[1:56:00] scribe
[1:56:02] amen so now he is called so he sees that
[1:56:05] now and then he begins to detail through
[1:56:08] the church ages what the true church has
[1:56:11] been doing and what the false church has
[1:56:13] been doing and then now there comes if
[1:56:16] you come to the
[1:56:17] end of let just go to Revelations 4:1
[1:56:21] and then we'll wind this
[1:56:24] up he's here now and he says after this
[1:56:28] what's after what the seven Church ages
[1:56:30] he's just
[1:56:31] seen after this I looked and behold the
[1:56:34] door was open and Heaven and the first
[1:56:37] voice which I heard as it were a trumpet
[1:56:40] talking with me said come up hither and
[1:56:44] I'll show you these things which must be
[1:56:48] hereafter
[1:56:50] so that voice that he heard behind him
[1:56:53] and he looks now that same voice speaks
[1:56:54] from Heaven saying come up hither and
[1:56:57] what is that that is the rapture of the
[1:56:59] bride at the end of the
[1:57:02] ages amen so it is the voice so so God
[1:57:05] is saying so God puts emphasis now on
[1:57:08] the voice the voice that spoke to me
[1:57:11] amen because the voice that spoke to
[1:57:13] John was very important to
[1:57:15] John amen so now we're here
[1:57:20] you're John you're John in the scripture
[1:57:24] now I don't think this is going too far
[1:57:26] but if you go to the end of Book of
[1:57:27] Revelation John fell down to worship the
[1:57:31] angel revealing the truth yeah that's
[1:57:35] what and he says don't worship me I'm
[1:57:37] one of your fellow Brethren the
[1:57:40] prophets
[1:57:42] okay so what it is now is actually a
[1:57:46] prophet revealing things to John of of
[1:57:49] what has been what is and what shall
[1:57:52] come amen and then at the end of it he
[1:57:54] falls down to worship he says no I'm not
[1:57:56] because the word angel in the scripture
[1:57:58] means
[1:57:58] messenger amen Galatians I think 4:14
[1:58:01] Paul says you receive me even as an
[1:58:03] angel of God a messenger of God so it's
[1:58:06] not necessar an Angelic being I could
[1:58:08] say even this morning I am an
[1:58:10] angel because I'm bringing a
[1:58:12] message amen someone who's written a
[1:58:15] song and preaching through song they are
[1:58:17] an angel cuz they're bringing a message
[1:58:20] amen
[1:58:22] amen so
[1:58:24] now so so this Angel is speaking to John
[1:58:27] as a prophet and then now when you go
[1:58:30] into the message and and and then when
[1:58:33] when like in the Book of Revelation it
[1:58:34] says about the new heavens and new earth
[1:58:37] it actually says about the angel says
[1:58:38] come and
[1:58:40] see and so and and there's more than one
[1:58:42] place where the angel says come and see
[1:58:44] this and he showed John certain things
[1:58:46] and then when you go into the message
[1:58:47] now brother Brown speaks on the new
[1:58:49] heaven and new earth amen and then he
[1:58:51] reveals everything that that that that
[1:58:53] is spoken of in the Book of Revelation
[1:58:54] the angel says come and see the same
[1:58:56] things brother BR preaches on am
[1:58:59] remember I'm trying to make this book a
[1:59:00] lot more personal because it is a lot
[1:59:02] more personal oh that's just a bit up
[1:59:04] here no it's not because if there's a
[1:59:06] prophet at the end of the ages that
[1:59:08] reveals the truth then not only will his
[1:59:10] ministry be in the scripture but you'll
[1:59:12] be in the scripture and there's certain
[1:59:14] reasons why remember Jesus Jesus every
[1:59:17] day of jesus' life was
[1:59:19] Ed so it was predestinated that he'd go
[1:59:22] here he'd say this here he'd go here
[1:59:24] he'd say this here he'd go this say this
[1:59:26] here just like Paul's Journey as as the
[1:59:29] New Testament was unfolding to Paul it
[1:59:31] was an ordered Revelation by God the
[1:59:34] same thing with Moses Moses received the
[1:59:36] law on the you you know Mount Si but
[1:59:39] then God Contin tells Moses and Moses
[1:59:42] say thus sayth the Lord when you do this
[1:59:43] do this and this needs to happen when
[1:59:45] you do this and they're off the
[1:59:47] mountain amen they're not not there the
[1:59:49] whole
[1:59:50] time and so God is re unveiling more of
[1:59:53] himself as they're walking with God
[1:59:56] that's right amen this is not oh this is
[1:59:59] just adding no it's not Paul when Paul
[2:00:03] started preaching he didn't preach the
[2:00:04] book of
[2:00:06] Ephesians amen he was writing different
[2:00:09] Epistles and then the word was opening
[2:00:10] to Paul as he was walking with God just
[2:00:13] like Isaiah or Jeremiah or any of the
[2:00:15] prophets they didn't get their whole
[2:00:17] Revelation then slowly drip feeded out
[2:00:19] to the people what God revealed to them
[2:00:21] that's what they told yes amen amen and
[2:00:25] then
[2:00:26] so we come to this final
[2:00:30] age and
[2:00:33] then it's actually and then this is why
[2:00:35] you'll see I trust you can see yourself
[2:00:37] in the Book of Revelation where because
[2:00:39] John one man in a one man is a symbol as
[2:00:42] a whole people amen come up hither
[2:00:45] that's the Rapture of the church you see
[2:00:48] John as a as as a man is a symbol of
[2:00:52] you amen and it's the voice actually
[2:00:56] directs him to what he's seeing and
[2:01:00] doing amen you can see the same thing in
[2:01:02] Revelations 10 and the voice which I
[2:01:04] heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[2:01:06] said go take the little book and eat it
[2:01:08] become one with the become one with
[2:01:12] Christ amen so it's the voice that's
[2:01:15] guiding him as he walks and it's because
[2:01:19] there's something in the voice of God
[2:01:22] that's why I've been saying these whole
[2:01:24] things I trust it means something to you
[2:01:26] there's something in The Believer when
[2:01:28] they hear the voice of God Amen it
[2:01:31] speaks them like only he can and that
[2:01:34] transcends to me that transcends well I
[2:01:37] understand this and this is where I'm at
[2:01:40] in life this is what I know the Bible to
[2:01:43] be amen but if there's something in you
[2:01:46] the voice of my beloved how how how does
[2:01:50] he become a beloved because someone
[2:01:51] tells you no because you fall in love
[2:01:53] with him amen you you enter into a love
[2:01:57] relationship with him and that and
[2:01:59] because he is your beloved as I said
[2:02:01] maybe a couple of Sundays ago you just
[2:02:03] give yourself to him and your whole walk
[2:02:05] with him and how you live is because you
[2:02:07] love him he's my beloved's voice you
[2:02:09] know he is he is my beloved my beloved
[2:02:12] is mine and I am his and his Banner Over
[2:02:14] Me Is
[2:02:15] Love
[2:02:17] Hallelujah
[2:02:19] amen maybe we'll just leave it there
[2:02:22] forgive
[2:02:23] me but we have some
[2:02:26] musicians but I trust I trust you
[2:02:29] personally he is your
[2:02:31] beloved amen there's just something when
[2:02:33] you think about him because remember you
[2:02:36] say well we shouldn't go by emotion
[2:02:39] anything without emotion is
[2:02:41] dead
[2:02:42] amen anything without emotion you see
[2:02:45] them on the book of you know you read
[2:02:47] about the Church of the book of Acts
[2:02:49] this is not see this is how many people
[2:02:51] think it would be in modern churches or
[2:02:53] maybe more older churches and the spirit
[2:02:55] of the Lord sound of a Russian Mighty
[2:02:58] Wind came in Acts chapter
[2:03:00] 2 sound of Russian Mighty Wind and then
[2:03:02] clovered tongues of fire appeared on all
[2:03:04] of them this is how some Churches would
[2:03:06] be and they all said
[2:03:08] amen and they walked out very sensibly
[2:03:10] and
[2:03:12] well that's how many people are but
[2:03:15] something happened to them that was like
[2:03:17] a house on fire and a windy day they
[2:03:19] were so happy and rejoicing because this
[2:03:22] was that spoken by the prophet Joel amen
[2:03:26] and you see it all the way down through
[2:03:28] now we don't just go on emotion but if
[2:03:31] you know it's like if I didn't love my
[2:03:33] wife and have feelings for her when I
[2:03:36] think about her when I see her then
[2:03:37] there's something wrong with our
[2:03:39] relationship that's right I mean if it
[2:03:41] was just all Form and Function now Mrs
[2:03:43] glin here this this is what we'll do
[2:03:44] today and all very a good
[2:03:47] amen there's something very wrong amen
[2:03:51] and it's like the believer in Christ if
[2:03:53] it's all form and functioning well Lord
[2:03:55] I'll say my prayers and say the same
[2:03:57] kind of prayer and then I'll read my
[2:03:59] maybe one chapter or some memory verse a
[2:04:01] day and I'll go to church and I'll walk
[2:04:02] out for the rest of the week and I'm in
[2:04:04] there's something wrong
[2:04:06] am
[2:04:07] amen that's that's why and what was the
[2:04:10] complaint against the Ephesian Church
[2:04:12] you have left your first love you got to
[2:04:15] read it acts chapter I mean um
[2:04:16] Revelations 2 so there should be
