TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] about i was talking to a young fella today at a work site he was sort of a monk looking fella and uh he was trying to give me some tracks and stuff of their religion and um and um after we talked a little bit and i told him i was a question and stuff and just before he left he said yeah um all the questions they seem to be happy if anybody everybody has a christian that he meets that they're happy so uh and uh i thought yeah it's a pretty good testimony because we have something to be happy about we we have the answer to all of life's questions and whatever that might throw at us personally so and uh just so you all know i'm in my socks okay you see that i didn't have time to bring my shoes so [Music] can we just bring up the first song delight yourself on the lord [Music] regardless [Music] [Applause] is he is [Music] myself [Music] hey [Music] is [Music] myself in here [Music] yourself [Music] everybody [Music] myself [Music] everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] yourself in the lord [Music] yourself um this may seem uh like a bit of an odd song to sing um at a service but um i just felt to sing it and um i just would like us to sing it with a mindset of um whatever harvest we sow will reap and um whether that's just sowing in your own life sowing to righteousness you will reap that down the track even the goat may go through a winter season um or if you uh if you're um sowing into somebody else's life nothing might seem to happen but but what you sow you will reap and um so by the isaac song reap the harvest and just like to sing that i won't do it justice you probably all listen to the youtube version [Music] into it [Music] so [Music] all the precious to see all these [Music] wants to kiss his face as they reached up to heaven they raise up their arms rejoicing and as [Music] the [Music] an overthrow [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] praising [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is [Applause] [Music] play there are times [Music] as you later [Music] foreign [Music] me [Music] it's over [Music] the time [Music] um he is able it's not the one you were playing before [Music] to accomplish to handle anything [Music] yes [Music] to accomplish he is he is [Music] much [Music] me to do much more than i could ever [Music] we just sing that song in his time as um as isaac would take over the service [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's beautiful [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] me [Music] things [Music] to you [Music] i mean just as the musicians playing let's just um it's just open in prayer this evening lord we thank you for that promise that we know lord that you make all things beautiful in your time that sometimes it's not quite our time lord but we've learned lord that you are almighty god lord and that you're in control of every situation lord and that we are confident in your time lord maybe we'll never see your time on this earth lord maybe things may happen after we're gone lord but we're confident that you have a perfect plan and a perfect time for everything lord jesus so we just thank you for that lord and we rest assured lord that you you know the plans that you have for us lord plans to prosper us plans to bless us lord and to do us no harm so we just thank you that we can trust in your lord we just pray you'll continue to bless the service this evening and we just thank you for your presence amongst us lord in jesus name amen amen thank you musicians thank you brother marion apparently i've just been repromoted to the job of running all the music [Applause] you know the bible says cast your bread upon the waters and it will turn after many days i i tried to cast this one on the waters and it returned back [Laughter] um the reason why i say that is because i then would allocate who song leads [Laughter] and i'm adding you to the list you've got the job i liked what you said about the monks well what they said about the christians you know that that we've already found the pearl of great price you know we're not they they say would you like to have peace i've already got it um praise the lord so so tonight what we are going to do we've got one of these sort of old-fashioned prayer meetings um so i've got just only a small thought that i want to share this evening and then then i want to just have a little chance for the different ones if you've got a testimony in your heart you would like to share because um sometimes you know we we see each other in in church format but we don't really get a chance to sometimes sit down and just find out what someone's going through a little testimony or something you know so sometimes i feel like these this sort of format of a meeting we get a chance to hear something from the different brethren and just have that and then any prayer requests you have you can after that just you you can um speak those and then and then but we are going to do the modern way and all pray together once we um go to prayer and i'm going to switch my mic off when that happens so that i'm not just echoing through the sound system [Laughter] um yeah so that so so if you've got a testimonial or something or a prayer request then that's we're going to have a little time after that so i'm only going to be really short tonight because i've got to keep to the format that i've set for myself so i'm going to be about 10 or 15 minutes let's um stand i've got um a few scriptures i want to read and then we can sit back down my first scripture is hebrews 5 verses 11 to 14. sorry children i don't have any slides today i know you're all sitting there to watch the screenie hebrews 5 11 to 14 says of whom we have many things to say and yet and hard to be uttered seeing you dull of hearing for when the time came you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the the oracles of god and i become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for here as a babe but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil i also want to read from second peter verse chapter 3 verses 14 to 16. wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the long suffering of the lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom giveth given unto him hath written unto you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things and which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest or wrestle as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction may the lord blesses where you can have your seats um this evening so although it may look like i've got a few notes here i don't really have many notes i'm more just going to speak and probably not really follow these because i don't really have a streamlined thought as such that i kind of usually do because it didn't really happen that way so i've just got a scattering of thoughts this evening but the two scriptures that we read uh they talk about they talk about someone that doesn't quite you know someone that eats that's not quite where they should be or just not quite things aren't quite working out for them but let me start off with a little story and then i'll we'll move on from there i didn't know it but i've always had this funny little tongue tie thing that was annoying to me that shannon used to make fun of me because i couldn't really poke my tongue out you know like if i it just wouldn't really work and it was kind of i didn't really care about it but i went to the dentist a little while ago to get some work done on my teeth my annual checkup there was nothing wrong just cleaned them then when i was there i said to my dentist i've heard that you cut these tongue ties he said yeah i do cut tongue ties you know we do that i said i i have a bit of a tongue tie there he's and he looked at he said no you kind of do it's not real bad but you do have one i said oh can you just cut it out then and he said yeah we can do that like let's look around for next week i said okay let's do it bad move i was slightly worried on the day because that night i had to i was meeting all these actors and soundies out at our place to um re-record some of the parts in this little thing i'm making you know when you go to the dentist they inject all the stuff into your mouth and you it's like you're like for the rest of the day i thought man the appointment was in the morning and i thought hopefully by the end of the day my mouth is back to normal otherwise i'm going to be like trying to talk to these guys and i'm trying to run this operation you know this has been planned for a long time but it kind of all worked i went there and he injected all the anus the local anesthetic and cut this thing out showed me what he did and it was all kind of going well and then he gave me this stuff to rinse my mouth every once in a while to supposedly make the pain go away but it was really painful so painful it was so painful like but i didn't know how painful it was because the anesthetic was still there and then the day went on and i was like yeah feeling this is kind of getting a bit painful and i was drinking this stuff every two hours to supposedly it makes the tongue go a bit numb and i didn't eat any food that day because i kind of wasn't planning on eating food anyway but i didn't not eat food because of that i just thought i just need food today you know i usually i don't sometimes on fridays i don't but i thought i'd transfer it to thursday because i can and then we did all the stuff and the actors came that night and i could actually talk and everything and then come about nine o'clock 9 30 i was so hungry i was like man i'm really hungry i just want to eat some food shannon had gone into town and she'd got my favorite fast food which was turkish um uh eskender mixed skinned with salad no rice just salad on so good and she laid this fast food on the table and i was like man i'm so hungry i'm going to devour this fast food this turkish i put what i stuck i put a mouthful in my mouth that spoonful in my mouth and started what i'd had chili in it yeah yeah chili chili sauce and i tried to bite the stuff and it was so painful but i loved that this food i was like i've just got to eat this and i took another bite and i'm trying to chew this and when you can't move your tongue you don't realize how much work your tongue does when you're eating food do you realize it like it pushes the food around it pushes it under your teeth and you chew that and then if you've got other bits it moves it it's like they say you don't know what you've got till it's gone man i'll tell you when it was gone i just and i couldn't push the food to one side so i'd have to shake it and every time you chew it was so painful but i love this food so much i took about after about four mouthfuls i think i was fainting almost in pain because i was thinking this is so painful i was getting sick like and i just said to shannon i can't eat any more of this food i'm done man i just can't eat it but i'm so hungry it was such a disappointing experience you couldn't eat the food you know like that's it was so good i couldn't eat it so then i was like man i've got to eat something i'm hungry so we had to go into town and we looked around there was a curry place open and we got the softest curry we could find which was some sort of weird fish curry or something laska with a bit of fish in it so basically soup so i could just drink the soup and even you don't realize with your tongue too that stops all the food from falling out of your mouth too you realize that you put it in your mouth and the tongue sort of slurps up and because i've got food i'm trying to eat this food and it's just dripping down my it's all over my shirt and i'm explaining to the lady look i've got this funny tongue i can't eat much and you you've got to pour it in and eating food was such a boring experience because it took so long to eat a bowl of soup you know and then i had to live on soup and smoothies for like three days you know how awful that is like i don't mind eating not much food but i got so tired of having soft food in my stomach just soup and i thought man i can't wait till i can eat something a bit more solid some decent food because i was starting to feel weak like when this stuff's not sustaining me i'm feeling weak it's not working for me this soft food you know that that got me to thinking about about when the bible talks about you know like milk where there's a that milk is for babes and you need strong meat you need something to sustain you we can't now we're talking spiritually now we can't live off soft things we actually need something we need meat we need we need meat to sustain us and we need the the deeper things of god and things like that to actually sustain us spiritually we you try living off smoothies in like soup it just doesn't quite work you know and then milk and that sort of stuff and and you know as christians we are seven more minutes to go as christians we need to have we need to be sustained by this by by the the deeper things of god and the more i thought about this i thought you know sometimes we think we think the deeper things of god are like things that i understand when i get more i understand more mysteries which in a sense they are but sometimes they are actually harder things that we understand that we have to go through the word of god tells us and we think yes lord i'll i'll go through that it's not always just like oh now i understand that this symbol means that and this one means that and this one is there and there it's actually equipping us with things we need in order to carry on to keep going because i don't want to make it sound bad but the christian walk is very hard we're in a raging battle and we have a we have a ruthless enemy that is out to destroy us and he has and i've seen it more and more lately and young guys i've seen it now with young people it's it's a it's been an eye-opener that we satan is a ruthless enemy well with the with war we have what they call the geneva conference so there are rules even in when countries fight countries they now have although it seems like it's just as disorganized chaos where everyone fights each other there are rules to war you fight and then if people break the rules after the war they say hey you broke this rule you broke that rule and they they they get done for war crimes they they're punished you know but so even in our even humans we have what was that was that a phone call oh reminder for me to finish no there are rules to rules of rules of war even in the so we you can't just if someone surrenders you're not allowed to shoot that person things like that there are there are rules to keep even war civil you know but i want to say this satan doesn't play by any rules whatsoever he's a he's a ruthless enemy the bible says about him that he goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour he and and he stops at no there's nothing that he won't that he thinks i better not do it that way like he'll he'll start lying to these little guys here he'll lie to little guys to destroy their life to make them hate their parents to make them go off there these are just little people that are barely even learning how to do anything and he will ruthlessly put evil thoughts in their mind to make them start to hate what's right and hate good and that he when their minds aren't even really right enough to even process it he's firing it in there that that's the sort of ruthless enemy that we serve and the reality is because we serve an enemy like that we can't be babies in this walk we can't be soft people we can't we can't just be like we can walking around [Music] now god doesn't make life hard for us but because we live in a world where we have a ruthless enemy we have got to actually be tough we have got to be there is no other way we will actually survive unless we have unless we understand a bit about how things work and that it's going to be rough it's going to be tough you know these are sometimes i think these are more the media things of the word like hey prepare yourself you're going to have major disappointments you're not going to know what's going on and you're going to have to press on you're going to pray and ask the lord for things and it ain't going to happen it's going to go the opposite way and you're going to wonder what's going on you've got to press on and satan's going to be there to throw all sorts of stuff at you and tell you this and then lie to you and throw you off the track you've got to be making sure you're you're eating the right meat and have the right understanding to think i don't care what it looks like it's all going to be all right everything's going to work out i don't care if i can look back and see all my faults have brought me here and it's a big mess up it doesn't matter the lord's in control thank you you understand we we have to understand this is how it works if we don't understand that way then we're going to start complaining we're going to start we're just like weak babies you know we complain and it's i'll tell you a little another little story you want to hear a little story so there's a new craze went through the church real bad one you know what it was people started buying little dogs these little fluffy dogs i think sister case started then everyone followed her and started getting little fluffy dogs you know before you know it i think were you first jenny got a little fluffy dog and then the cliffords had to follow they got these fluffy dogs i don't like fluffy little dogs you don't know why i don't like these little fluffy dogs because they remind you just something that's soft and all like like a you know i don't like if you'll get to know me i don't like things that are soft and and soft attitudes others don't like it so when i see these little dogs these little soft little things you know i think i look at these silly little dogs you know give me a real dog that's like cuffed these little dogs are wimpy little things you know not all of them okay now i'm not saying they are this is just my perception i'm probably wrong right but these things seem like they and they sit around and sleep and they get carried around these little handbags by people and you know hey sister kale never talked to me again now and do you know what happened after that we got a little dog could you believe we ended up with a little dog i couldn't believe it i'm like man this is like this is all gone we're this is we're in the gutter now we're done it's all over but we didn't get a little fluffy dog no no no we got this little thing called a fox terrier at first i thought i had this stolen this thought in my mind i don't like these little dogs you know silly little dogs little soft little things but this little dog over the weeks and months i watched this little dog and i thought it grew on me i'm like there's something about that little dog that i like that walks around like it's all tough look going around and it's like and then as it's grown a bit it starts like it's now protecting the house you know that's the first protector of our property now if a car comes near it that's going to attack the car right there's a car here and it really genuinely is going to attack that car like right car you could not come closer beware and it walks around like it's this the most powerful little thing in the world you know and i thought what is it about that little dog that i really i'm starting to admire about this little dog what is it and i kind of clicked i realized the thing that i like about that little dog is that it thinks it's a lot better than what it actually is to the rest of us it looks like a silly little dog but not to that little dog that's this powerful awesome thing that's that can do all things you know and it's and i've got so much respect for that little dog because i think you know i respect things people like that someone that it might look like they're not much but if their attitude is you know i can do all things i kind of like that i don't like a soft attitude and i look at this little dog thing okay then you are what you think you are it's you are a tough little dog even though most of the ventures it goes to try and do it cannot achieve it tries to ward people off it can't but it doesn't think that it just thinks i can i can do it and i think that's what we have to be as christians you know it's we have to be actually tough and like we've got to have that we can't be like these little soft fluffy dogs that are we've got to have backbone to us you know and be and be be tough be strong you know that's i know it sounds harsh but sometimes the thing to say to people is you actually need to toughen up now i'll give you an example like with a little child you know a little child falls over they do things and you you won't say toughen up but you'll say hey little buddy you'll be right you know they cry you say it's all right you know but as it go off a bit when they get a little bit bigger and they cry because they get a sore knee you know break their knee and they start crying you don't say oh sorry you know sorry buddy you say actually hey hey you're a bit bigger now bro well you need to stop crying like you can't just cry every time you get hurt you otherwise you're going to go through life when things are hard on you you're going to cry you've got to learn that hey even if you're hurt you stop crying now it sounds harsh you think oh i should really comfort them but that's not really what you should do and look and the lord actually does it with us he doesn't you notice he's not soft some of the the a man said lord my father's died let me go and bury him he said let the dead bury the dead come follow me but that's my father you know we were boss and buddies oh we'll stay then see you you know it's hard he said he warned he warned the disciples of what's going to come up because he said they're going to persecute they'll throw you in prison they'll do these things i've warned you so you won't be offended so you'll actually be able to handle it when it happens oh that's what he told us about this we're ready to to take it on you know he doesn't make us soft he actually doesn't want us to be soft he doesn't want us to and the first bit of resistance we get the trouble in the fellowship we get you know we've got to be tough we've got to actually we've got to have a tough attitude and we've got to not complain you can't complain you know like paul when he after a while you'd think if he went preached got beaten up and nothing went his way and then he ended up in prison he had every right to complain but you imagine if you didn't know what was happening to him and we had cell phone he had cell phones in that time and then you thought oh out of the blue he was in another country i got brother paula ringing and you rang him up and he and you could hear singing in the background you're like oh hey brother so just catching up how are you doing and you can hear someone singing on the other end of the line not him but someone else he's like oh yeah we're just singing some songs in that having a good time you'd think oh he must be with the brothers at the church you know they're having a prayer meeting awesome where are you i said i'm in prison just finished being beaten up that's where we are you didn't hear him complaining well how often do we we get a bit of hardship in our life we say why lord why is this happening to me it's such a soft attitude don't say that don't say that you can say it if you want to but i'm telling you it's not the right response to the situation so the sooner you take that out of your vocabulary the better off you'll be because if you have that attitude you'll it'll be hard for you to find the victory in the situation now this might seem hard but that's the reality of the way that it works the the to be a mature strong christian you've got to put away that crying and stuff and you know why is this happening to me oh no i hope this would happen we often like to share testimonies you know i prayed for this and then i got it and praise the lord now you can share that afterwards if you'd like to but you know why not we pray you know i really wanted a promotion and then it was all looking like i was going to get it these guys said yep you're pretty much going to get it and then and then and i was going to get this new position and it was all going to work and then so i went there and then i didn't get it praise the lord you know i'm so happy i just he said no you you're not going to get a promotion in fact we're going to cut your hours and i said awesome thanks so much that's great you know praise the lord that was my testimony folks i'll sit down next person share you know we think that's not much of a testimony but but what of it you know what of it it the bible says endure join with me in suffering like a good soldier of christ jesus or other words says thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ hardness means when it's nothing's working for you still just praise the lord you just you're happy you're moving on therefore my dear brothers and sisters stand firm let nothing move you this is a different version always give yourselves fully to the work of the lord because you know that your labor and the law does not in vain gonna share one last little bit and then we're gonna i'm gonna stop because my time is up i'm just gonna get the scripture this is slightly on the same thought but um i don't know why i want to share this but this thought has always intrigued me and it's this will be a little food for thought to think about ecclesiastes 1 17 and 18 says and i gave my heart to no wisdom and to no madness and folly i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit foreign much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow in other words he's saying the more that you start to understand the more sorrow and the more down you're going to get because you're just going to start to notice things and it's going to start looking more and more like it's going to start to affect you and it's going to bring you down and you know we say lord fill me with all wisdom and lord may i grow in wisdom the reality is as you grow in wisdom the the you're going to go this other way you know that's the reality that's what it's like if you didn't care about foolishness foolishness wouldn't affect you if you see foolish things you'd say this is great but when you perceive it as follow you think i've got to sit this in my mind and i've got to look at this and understand this and i think it's silly you see you start to see things but so so what's the solution as you understand the lord more it brings you down more you just got to get stronger and you know you life becomes harder as you go on trials become longer people think wow one day this you know i'll be glad when i'm out of this trial there'll be another one harder than that on its way never you mind that's the way that this is but to to just to close it off on something a bit more positive so that it doesn't sound like all drudgery it's only drudgery because we have a raging enemy but the lord hasn't made it drudgery for us on purpose like oh i'm going to create this earth and then put these guys here and just make it miserable for them he his heaven is not going to have trials his place doesn't have trials he is only doing this here because he knows i have to make you like this to overcome that enemy because he's ruthless i've got to train you this way it's not too i'm going to give make your life hard just just because i get enjoyment out of seeing your life miserable it's not like that but he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for my yoke is easy and my burden is light that's actually what he says and you know why that is it's because his intention for us is good his yoke will never break us it'll never it will never it will never crush us down to where we no longer can be satan's yoke breaks people to eternally finish them that's that's the end of his yoke is to eternally finish somebody the lord's yoke is to make us eternal so his yoke will never that's why he says it's easy oh you might have hardships and things his yoke is very easy his burden is light and i'm going to close on this that as much as i say i don't complain you no one really hears me complain much to you guys but i do i don't complain to the lord but the bible says cast all your cares upon me on him for he cares for you and i've found that when i get in a situation i can just go before the lord and say lord i'm just finding this very very hard and i can just i can cast my cares upon the lord and somehow something happens the peace that passes all understanding and something changes and somehow it just becomes easy i don't i don't i can't explain what happens but suddenly it becomes easy and and you understand you you you receive the care of the lord you you understand what it is so i pour out my complaints to the lord say lord and sometimes when i'm in the hard situation i just say lord i just don't know what to say here and i just i just say lord i'm in i'm hurting i'm hurting here that's a that's all i have to say in the situation i'm hurting but you know he's the great comforter and he comforts you know you go and try and tell satan you're hurting and see if you get comfort you you'll you'll get more and more depressed he'll lead you down this road of chaos but you go into the lord and say lord i'm hurting he's a comforter and that's where the christians get all their strength from they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength that's where we get all of our strength from that's why the monk realizes these people are happy you know because we get all of our strength from the lord and and and that's actually the thing that makes us tough the spirit of god is unbreakable never will break it never will fold it never will back down it's it's just powerful you know and that's the sort of god we serve so i'm gonna close now and i'm gonna um if you have a little testimony or anything you'd like to share you can share good things and then um if you have any free requests i i am i have one um i know i'll chew that in the pre-request time is it's funny not funny it's not a coincidence if you pray about something and if everything happens today so now we never pray for our neighbors we never ever since we moved into ricky rang we never prayed for our neighbors i mean my wife would know this morning we woke up and we're always just praying and we prayed for our neighborhood and we prayed for protection and and specifically we said lord and also the people there which is doing the wood works and all those things just protect them and that was the guy that fell down the cliff now never before have we prayed for that and then when we saw the helicopter because the the respect helicopter came in and it was hovering there and we could see there was something going on and i said to chantal because we didn't i don't think it was strange it looks like it's at the woodwork place and yeah that's that's where the accident happened so there's a reason that a christian would pray no you don't even know why you're praying god knows that he's already making an intercession for that situation through you and so we're not as weak as you think you are even just by praying in sincerity for someone the lord can answer that prayer so yeah it made me very humble again and think about what power and it matches so beautifully with dove tells what you say what power a christian really has that we're not aware of and has that spoken word being returned right so yeah true testimony and i see prayer and are totally different so when that brother that's got that high blood pressure the pre-request came through you actually then said lord this is my duty you know as a christian i need to jump in here i need to pray now because it works you know because it worked for him so it works so and and then you take that pretty more sincere yeah even with just decay with your husband you see a prayer request come through and then you you feel duty bound you know you feel like that little dog you know i have to go and i have to now go give everything i have because somebody has to hear this the lord has to hear this so you can intervene so yeah make me think about it um a week just but i think everyone can hear me right lovely thank you brother um it's kind of a an interesting thing i was listening to last night and just followed on you know sometimes you're listening to the message and then the testimony comes or something strikes you and you think that's interesting and so it just made me think of it today with what isaac's saying it's a um a family had called brother brennan to come and pray for their daughter and i think she'd either died or she was near death on the bed and um and brother brennam came in and he was there for a little bit and then he says um because there was some unbelieving family around and he said that they were just crying and crying and he said um all the people need to stop crying because when you cry it weakens you it weakens the face in the room i was like wow just something that struck me and i thought you know sometimes we can be overwhelmed with emotions and it can take us away from the path that the lord's got for it and so i think either the people left the room and then the lord's able to deal and i was like wow lord help us but um i was having a little chat with a small person today and i was just it got me thinking about a few things in life and how um in the denominations that i've been in my walk with the lord that's always been in the past before i heard about the message i was just it got me thinking about how much it was so much works based and have i been good enough have i done enough have i and it's sort of subconscious because you know you can't earn your salvation it's a gift but it was always this have i read enough have i prayed enough have i fasted enough have i even just been sincere enough or sensitive enough to the lord or kind enough to people you know you always have a standard enough enough enough and you're working so hard towards this and it's all this pressure that comes on and um it was just interesting i the conversation that i had with a little person it was just saying you know what all of that that's not that actually doesn't take you to heaven that actually doesn't that doesn't that's not what's going to get us there on that day and um then the little quote come through from god provided a lamb and brother branham says you love him and more you love him the more faith will accumulate i was like wow and it just got me thinking about them about that really lovely song um falling in love with jesus [Music] falling in love with jesus falling in love with jesus it's the best thing i've ever ever done and it just goes on in your arms i feel protected and your arms never disconnected in your arms i feel protected there's no place i'd ever rather be and it just takes all the pressure off when you just fall in love with him and even listening to that song reap the harvest tonight like breaking up the the ground sometimes it can get hardened like there's areas that get hard and there's a hard season you know and just just keep up breaking up the ground just stay soft of the lord just keep your relationship close with him fall in love with him over and over again that's that's all i guess i'm sharing a testimony too that's just a small one i'm so glad that we have the lord in every situation whatever i am facing once that's how that course you know i put my trust in jesus amen he will never put me to shame amen and like so i had we had a situation just a it was just a conflict of interest um situation in the professional sector and um i needed direction and i just want to encourage everybody here that no matter how hard the whatever the challenge is in front of you if you sincerely talk to the lord about it and now this is a different type of cry it's a spiritual fervent cry of to the lord and and like it's like a it's like a your heart speaks and it speaks a request with fervency and i came to you and we will come to these points where we fervently need an answer you can't go without an answer there is only one thing that you can you you it's either answer or stop right and i need it and when you get to that point because if you're really serious with the lord and i was in this situation where um well i had to find out what to do with business and um and how to manage a situation between an employee and and um and our standards as christians but without being you know you don't want because people don't understand christianity if they're not christian right you've got to manage people in a way that they can understand that and so i come and i can't just go and say it's just this big religious thing and all of that with without baby compromising everything and so i had to i asked the lord i said lord what do you want us to do and you know and i really meant that and i was praying in my car and it was just like the thoughts just came sweeping in and it was the law basically said you if you just you know like it was basically you know with the businesses that we're doing there's industries that are fine like in promoting industries and promoting and marketing industries there's questionable ones and then there's industries that are just complete no-go zones right as a christian as a conflict of interest and i i was like well we've got guys that are going out looking for stuff that i would consider a no-go zone where they are trying to be good so in their mind they're thinking i know i'm working for a christian company i've got to be good or i'm going to try and behave myself and i'm not going to do things that are going to be aggravating my christian bosses and so you know their intentions are right and it's like well lord what do we do i don't want to just go and you know just pulverize somebody with my my faith which is fine you if you want to do that but for me you have to be wise in the way that you administer your you know your faith and everything and um and so i prayed to the lord i said lord what do i do and the lord gave me the thoughts straight away clear as they categorize all the industries into three industries into three sections and one first section is green second section is yellow and third section is red so it was definitive answer to a question i had no idea what to do like i was ready to just give it all up and do nothing right i'd rather do that than go and compromise and go and allow satan into my business and satan to just laugh at me and laugh at everything and just destroy and and so the lord gave me an answer and he said do that and he said now when i say he said i'm not talking about like hearing an audible voice but this was just thoughts coming and but you know it's god and he said he said give me the green you'll never need the yellow or the red and he said and he said like if you just focus on the green and that green stuff is just like industries that are fine as christians don't even you'll never need to worry you you guys won't even need to go into the yellow and questionable stuff or read just watch what i can do and so i just want to encourage you like that was for me and we will all come up against things now don't give up don't just stop and pull back pulling back is not the answer to progress as a christian dormancy is not the answer but god will give you the answer he gave me the answer and it's the wisdom of god that passes our understanding amen um i didn't really want to share this publicly but um just in regards to going back to work one of the challenges with my work situation over the last year or so has been just what i feel is the morals of the employer not being as what we would see as a christian not being very fair and haven't really felt that good about working for him but when i took the job i had a distinctive voice speak to me sort of like how andy said not an audible voice but just a definite leading that that was the job to take and so having this time off and considering these things and wondering what to do whether i should find another job or but every time i look at other jobs or start to think about it it just always come to me like the lord said i told you to take this job but i haven't told you to leave it and if he ever says to leave it then i'll leave it you know it's but i just even though i feel bad working for the guy i've never had i know the lord said to take it and i don't know why but i've never felt to leave but so i'm going to be going back for return to work program starting tomorrow for four hours a day or something and i went and had a meeting with my manager clay who had been trying to buy the business ever since we started he sort of started it but was not the owner not the funder behind it and so he's done a deal to buy the company outright off the guy that owns it which is the one with the bad morals and the one that's been difficult to work for so going forward it looks like we're no longer going to have to deal with that situation of this guy that's been the real issue the whole time so that's looks good trusting the lord until he leads otherwise um i hadn't intended on sharing this at all either but um just because brother isaac asked um and i felt the lord put on my heart like right when he asked um you might remember my mother-in-law james's mum came down at the start of december angie and so this is actually not my testimony this is her testimony of you all so technically it's all of your testimonies i just wanted to tell this and say that as from her perspective she told us this on the weekend or told me that you know each one of you really spoke to her when she was here so i just wanted to say thank you for being such a testimony to the unbelievers that come through here and she mentioned pretty much everyone almost by name just going through the children the young ones the parents the sisters the fathers everyone she just she would ask me what's this sister's name or what's this brother's name she just went through all of you and just said i really appreciated this one or that one or whatever so i just wanted to say thank you for being a testimony to out some of our unbelieving family at the moment um and that thank you and yeah praise the lord for being a testimony just add to that quickly as well um it was funny you know like when you take you go around somewhere with your kids where like you're always bragging on your own kid or your your sister's kid like your nephews or your nieces and or something like that you know but we're around at my cousin's place and um mum would always be bragging about their kid or about one of my other cousins kid or something but she brought it up with the other family around and we felt a bit there but she was just saying about how wonderful the youth here are and she's i've never never known so just such a happy healthy bunch of kids they all they're all healthy and they're all just so happy and they're just such wonderful children she just kept bragging on about the family god here almost the point we felt bad but you know so the kids are a testimony as well um i okay so about where um isaac this is what you just basically said you don't need to talk um give your testimony about you prayed for it and god gave it to you um anyways that happened um um i just want to um when um marion sang um as to sing reap the harvest that was actually really really in good timing because i was thinking about something like we've had no clinical manager for most of the time that i've been at my at my current job now and that makes it really rough on a lot of like yeah i'm not not even going to go into details um but we've recently gotten a clinical manager and that's something i've been praying about for the almost two years that i've been there and like yeah just different things and i knew that that could fix a lot of problems um so we've recently got a clinical manager who is i think she's gonna be incredible um but i was thinking about that today and i was also just thinking how i just lost my train of thought oh yeah i was thinking about how once i listened there was a minister who talked about david and how he just before he became a king or god anointed he just he'd go out to the fields and he'd he'd um go water the feet water the sheep take them into the pasture go practice my sling play a few songs on the harp next day do the same thing over again and the next day do the same thing over again and sometimes it feels like you're doing that at work it's like you just go water the sheep i mean brush the teeth and feed and water your people and do the same thing over again practice on the on the on my harp or whatever and it just feels like that's all repeat repeat so um yeah i just wanted to give god the glory for that and i think i was going to say something else too but my mind just went blank um also i would um if we could maybe just keep brother george smith and um okay so i went to israel a few years ago and on tour with brother george smith and a jewish man named rovin reuven and he passed away a few days ago and i think brother george smith was very close to him so if we could maybe just keep ruben's family and brother george smith in prayer also one more so we're driving down the road once and then um my door wasn't closed properly so then um um i opened my door to close it um to open it and close it again and we're still on the road and then two cars came past when i did it and then i was like a little child so i opened it wide and then i closed it and then um two cars um fitted in just and i don't know how that happened um and it was a miracle it was a miracle otherwise my door had been ripped off thank you um my my testimony is around um you know ever since we came here to this church the lord has done tremendous things personally in my life and but what really stands out for me as i'm sitting here you know i never i never used to preach in my life and even when i came here i never asked the pastor to i never raised my hands that i can preach so i was amazed when he asked me but but what i knew is that the lord has done something through the same ones that brother ben has preached you know to me personally and i always treasure it so much so uh my testimony is more in line with what brother isaac said you know like then i started to read the scriptures and i pray for god to help me then when i saw the enemy starting to attack um uh what what i'm doing for the children of god then i i knew that perhaps it was it was a good idea for me to to agree to read the bible so but but i knew that i'm not a minister so and then then the devil tries to attack in all france you know all different sorts of ways and and what isaac said earlier on you know just confirmed to me that you know no wonder the bible says uh counted all joy when all sorts of things happens to you you know and to be honest with you brothers and sisters we are better off with trials because they bring character and and to be honest with you we don't get too spoiled but the spirit of laodicea is the spirit of being spoiled and just getting things easy and until someone said you know easy come easy go so we we we are in a situation where we have to pray for god to to allow the devil to to bring it on because that helps us to to really be closer to god and you know bring the the time to go home even much closer so pray for me i don't claim to be any any sort of a preacher or anything but one thing that the lord confirmed to me was that even if even if the whole church cannot hear you but i'll have someone who will hear and will get will get blessed and i said lord maybe that also includes me to hear that and so i just want to thank god for all his trials and temptations and um that we must not be ceases you know we must not allow the devil to to take us for a ride because he knows that we are actually above him but he makes it as if he's above us you know all the time and and we fall for it so may god just bless each one of you praise the lord we've enjoyed having you enjoyed your sermons hello everybody hope everyone's having a good week i just want to take a quick opportunity to um thank god for everything he's done in my life over the last two years since i've been here um i can't say i knew any of you sexually or okay and jenny but um um yeah i'm a lot of i'm a different fellow since i came here and god's really um really worked on me i'm a lot happier um i've got a lot more forgiveness and character for people i stick things through and um do my best to them before i i definitely wasn't the same sort of person i didn't have the same sort of character i have now i wouldn't really have cared about many things um and yeah just wanted to say all the young people too just keep fighting um i've been noticing that the devil is so angry and he doesn't play by any rules so you know it doesn't matter what he has to do to get him between somebody he'll do it and um the thing that struck me a couple of weeks ago is he'll he'll get him between friends and he'll get in between people and he'll he'll just kill them he'll just kill them he wants to take life from everything and he doesn't care just laugh at you you know someone will scream the last death scream and be gone forever and he just laughs he doesn't care he doesn't play by any rules but god does and he loves us all and he wants us to forgive and have compassion keep fighting guys we haven't had testimonies i just remembered i've the most important part of my testimony what i was gonna say i missed the most important part um actually about the man having a manager that was that's cool but that wasn't actually what i wanted to say is that um what i had been praying for is that god would just give me a joy that i hadn't felt in a long time like just going to work and um what brother um reminded me that um i just want to thank god for restoring that joy that i haven't felt in a long time [Laughter] but i want to say thank you lord even an importance of just having a good sleep at night you don't know what you're missing when you don't have it for a long time and um for me it's been off and on over a few years but with the housing situation it's been really hard with the last house we've had was a lot of stuff that was just hard on the lungs and then every time you go in there it's just even in a few moments it's just really hard to breathe so we finally moved into otaki beginning of february and i just struggled every night to breathe in that place as well because they just had painted it new everything's new so they got all the glue and everything i don't know what it was but maybe because my lungs are already kind of like damaged maybe so i was like oh no now we finally moved and i still can't um can't be in this place and it was like that it was woe is me it was crying and all that sort of stuff but you know the lord also says that we can do these things and brother branham says you know it's like a baby you cry out and the lord will answer and he has done that for me he has answered my prayer last night i slept so well i haven't done it for years i had such a good sleep and i just want to encourage everyone that might feel down sometimes and can't get up by themselves go to somebody ask somebody pray for me ask somebody talk to me just fellowship something like that helps as well don't get downcast yes the lord is on our side praise the lord thanks mate um i had a dog like your sponge too and like you said it was hard it's it's it's a miniature doberman type of thing so it's got those brain waves of i don't mean so you got a good dog but i'll buy you a fluffy bag right my testimony is still what we're just talking about belinda and i and the last house that we left up nakata was really really severe we paid almost six thousand dollars for rent for not living there and and that's we don't have that sort of money so we went to the tribunals and the process was it that we were released from that one-year bond the whole rent but we haven't got any money back that's still in process okay but what i wanted to say is what i spoke to the pastor and and by the impo about a bit um almonds place is money is replaceable all right money is replaceable if you're chasing money don't it's replaceable because your health is you cannot replace your health right as i've seen the process of bacterium attacking my wife the whole concern is let's get out of here i'm not worried about what happens whether they throw you in jail your health is really really important it's just like your character your character you cannot replace all right but money you can replace so god is on our side amen do you have one i knew you did i just have to do it thank you okay so since last year in i think may my husband david his eye start is quite iterated and they are got a double vision so would he go somewhere i have to take him and it wasn't easy for me and sometimes i have to out of you know my workplace and i have to go with them and after then it's quite you know it takes time to you know heal his eyesight and so every four weeks and yeah six weeks and eight weeks i have to go to willington hospital to check with the i mean the specialist oh and uh yeah even though just take a time someone actually yeah he now he has our you know the prism lens so he can he can drive and yeah yeah god is so good and then also on the other side actually on the left side he had a frozen shoulder it's nothing happened as well so yeah it's quite tough and what you know he tried to exercise and this thing you know some massage to being there to you know check his shoulders but i don't know just in my heart sometimes and most talking about yeah god is you know god is real and god is looking after us as well so just keep going i can say that yeah god is in helping me and go through all the destroyers yeah but yeah also on the other hand you know sometimes it doesn't you know stop me yeah so my workplace was quite getting harder and harder because then we opened two more practices in last year february it's gotten getting busier and i have to look after other clinics about accounting as well and sometimes what my you know my boss said oh yeah 40 hours is enough for me and then i have my assistant and she has about 40 i'm 20 20 hours per week stay part-time job but it's getting it's too much yeah of a bit of my workplace and my circumstance as i end up five weeks ago i mentioned my boss you know it's enough so i rejoined my workplace so after that i feel so much better i don't care about my work in my circumstance even though my husband is not working i just i was so happy so i had such a good sleep when i make a decision so i came to i mean my research i handed into my resignation to my boss and he said you're quite so shocked because i've been there for nine and a half years but yeah he said oh i think hannah i think you made the wrong decision so can you think of it i'll give you 24 hours just you know often just let me know okay so i already made the decision so okay so my answer is you know okay that's it yeah done well following day he didn't come to workplace so okay so i mean i text him you know i want to mention this one to you in person but you are not here so i text them yeah i did i resigned this workplace you know today so yeah okay so he takes me back okay yeah if you made decision that way okay i accepted that after then about 30 days later he actually came to me because everyone i have to mention to my you know staff members and i'm resigning here when they say some people are crying and some people couldn't believe that you know end of you know how many i'm sorry i shouldn't mention his name probably need you know maybe three four people have to cover yours you know your jobs well end up he called me hannah actually you know i think about it what shall i do my you know my audience can be our full-time and also as much as you have your i mean your task you can delegate to the accountants as well so he gave a more opportunity to give me a you know delegate task to other staff members and to accountant as well so it's always a procedure doing the stuff as i have to talk with our content some of tasks i can give you know delicate tasks to them as well so god is so good and the i don't know i can see that what god is moving and you know the situation so think about them all the time you know no matter what you go through just you know praise the lord and you know give glory to god and the god will do you know handling all the situation you can move on all the mountains and even though sometimes you are in the valley you can still you can look up the sky and the god is watching over you yes praise the lord amen praise the lord i've just got one pre-request and then we can go we'll just pray it's that's what i like about this fellowship you know like that everyone wants to share it's nice it's just it's easier to stop something and start and try and get people to talk you know and i'm not too bashful that i can't say stop but everyone's happy no praise the lord i enjoyed that and um i just won't pray i've got two my um mother's mother passed away on um sunday that's it wasn't a shock so it's not you know that wasn't the request but um i found out that i have to um shed about five years ago before she got dementia she actually um nominated me in her will or her funeral wishes i suppose you'd say to do the eulogy and my father was to read a scripture she said kevin leaves scripture reading and brackets not too long and then isaac lee eulogy and um and it's you know of all the people she could have chosen you know in the whole family she she chose me now my grandmother's she's catholic she was brought up catholic and she she but she was a woman of faith i think she'd just been sidetracked by the catholic church but she was a real woman of faith and we had a we went to see her on the monday last week before she passed away and it was a real supernatural time there and she was she had a little crucifix there and she was saying i can't believe what they've done to this man look what they did to him and little aby went to give her a hug and she she she doesn't know who we are or anything you know she's got dementia she doesn't know who we are and she's saying to abraham do you believe in god and he'll say yes i do and she'll say you've taught him well you know as much as you forgot a lot of things she didn't forget the lord but the reason why i want asking for prayer for i suppose is because my family situation has been reasonably tough for a long time because my my family sort of a lot of them don't really serve the lord and they've always been anti-me for a long long time you know so i i avoid family get-togethers because i just don't enjoy this big booze up and that and i'm just like i don't i just don't go for years news i haven't gone so i don't really enjoy the environment and they probably think you know you're just shunning us you know but i went to one over christmas and it was just weird but um christmas before but um i went to one the last one we went to we went i can share this because just say give some backstory we went to another it was actually someone's birthday quite a prominent person on the family's birthday and we all made an effort to go there and then after about four hours of bar hopping whatever they call everyone's drunk and then we're at this other place and you know we're now talking about this person whose birthday it was i don't want to see how it is but and then and saying nice things and people saying i like this about you and that and so they're all drunk and everyone's going yeah and then i get up and you know to say my little bit about what i like about this person and it was like a it was an unbelievable scene because the person i was saying it to said was drunk and they're like they started attacking me it was it was real spiritual it was a demon you know and then and then they started saying things like who made you the pastor over us and all this stuff you know and and they were all drunk and they were i was and i was standing up in the at this big table and they're all just starting to then attack me spiritually it was the strangest thing i mean i i didn't really i thought this is why i don't come to these things i just don't want to be here i was actually a naughty boy and i was like hey guys look i appreciate that i'm out man i'm done i'm like i probably should have just said like i was going to sit down and i was like hey you guys just have you i've been here four or five hours already you guys have drunk on you know have a good rest of your party bye so it's kind of hard now like so i've got to go up on fr on friday and like oh who's this guy i think he's now he's no you know sort of like joseph you know like yeah do you know there's a bit of that going on and but you know after visiting nan on the on the weekend just before she passed away we were sort of the last people to see her and the family before she went and couldn't really talk or do anything she fell unconscious after the next day but you know i know that she chose me because she knew that i would tell the people she was a woman of faith you know she she loved the lord and that was that was her story and i know that's why she chose me and so i just want wisdom to it's a catholic church this is a catholic thing you know but she she's relying on me to tell the people i was a woman of faith you know and so she didn't want someone just talking about her life or anything she wanted someone to to say that so yeah that's just remember me on friday at about two o'clock and this brother andy says i should start blasting the catholic church when i'm up there but we'll give that a miss um yeah we've got um it's still this this is about usually when we pray but let's we can all pray together and then we'll just sing a few songs too close i'll just sing um let's just sing he cares for you then then we'll just all pray together after that [Music] he cares for you he careth for you [Music] through sunshine or shadow he careth for you [Music] one more time he careth for you [Music] he careth for you through sunshine or shadow he cares for let's just do it one last time he cares for you he cares for you [Music] he care for you [Music] through sunshine or shadows he careth for you amen this is we'll pray this evening along your ways you
