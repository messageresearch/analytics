rose again hallelujah more than just an empty tomb but he came to you i mean to prove that he's alive amen let's just bow our heads in the word of prayer oh lord jesus father that day when you were on the lord on the back of the donkey riding into jerusalem and the people cried hosanna they didn't really know what they were doing father but you're fulfilling your word but lord we can say hosanna to the king of kings lord we know what you're doing lord you've caused us to understand where we are lord that we have been redeemed by your blood father as we want to lift you up lord high above all else oh god make you king of kings and lord of lords father we don't just we don't just want to wait for that day on the other side when we crown you king of kings lord but we want to crown you now in our lives lord lord you're worthy lord you're you're the most wonderful person to us in all the earth oh god father you'd come down and find us and redeem us lord back yourself father and dear god as we open the pages of your bible lord anyone can open the pages but it takes you the author to come and father we know we're failures to begin with the lord you never fail us so god in your present here oh god father speak to every life lord this morning father may we just be changed lord by your holy spirit oh god father may we have a tent of ears oh god and prepared hearts to receive your word and may it bring forth a hundred fold lord may the devil be cast down oh god may be defeated once again father we thank you that the victory has already won lord you said it's finished lord that you you won a total victory that day we thank you father bless this time now we ask lord in jesus christ's name amen amen hallelujah thank you musicians amen oh good morning trust everyone had a good sleep and or as in one piece i mean uh if you've got your bibles handy we'll just uh turn uh to turn straight to the scripture i'm sorry it's so hot but uh yeah here we are i trust uh everyone can be as comfortable as they can be i'd like to go to romans chapter 8 and just read a very familiar piece of scripture uh there and then i'd like to go to second corinthians chapter 3 verses 17 and 18 so if we're romans chapter eight we're going to read from verse 14 down to verse 23. i'm sure this is all very familiar but sometimes we need to go over things you know to cement them down because some you know no doubt there'll be someone in here that they've heard for the first time amen and sometimes we can be sitting in church for years but then the lights go on and then we begin to hear so amen let's just read this here for as many are as led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption where i we cry abba father now let's just read that again that verse but just put i okay let's all read it together verse 15 for i have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but i have received the spirit of adoption whereby i cry ever father in other words my father my father hallelujah amen we know who we are we know where we're going and we know in whom we have believed amen the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs ears of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer that we suffer with him we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us so if you're suffering it doesn't even come into the equation of the glory that shall be revealed in you amen 4 4 sorry um verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature in that word is creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god or the revealing of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption and to the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth and pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to it the redemption of the body hallelujah and let's go to second corinthians uh chapter three and we'll read verses uh 17 to 18. he says this here he says now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord amen you may have your seats may the lord bless his word so i'd like to can you turn me down brother adamander but um i'd like to speak this morning if i if i try and approach the subject about the power of the blood in action because you know we understand even even in in the time of exodus and the first passover you know they had to apply the blood it was a it was an action that they had to do and so we i'll just read a i'll just read a you know a statement that brother bradham gives and he says this in experiences in 52 he says but now as i'm speaking to you like jesus did to the woman at the well now if there's something wrong with that woman and jesus talked to her a little bit he went right straight and told her what was wrong with her is that right not knowing her he was a jew and she was a samaritan he just stood up there at the well and she came by so after talking to her a little bit then he could tell her what was wrong now if i be a christian man if the spirit of god is in me and that is the spirit of christ then it'll make me conduct like him make me a christian like him on top of that if he gives us a spiritual gift the presence of god and all his presence near then he will be just like he was then he could go he could go straight see he has no lips on earth but mine ours he says no hands but ours our eyes he speaks through us and looks through us and sees through us he says is that right so if we want if god is going to do something he uses his body amen so if there is you know so for the in order for the for the very you know he you know as we read in romans chapter 8 he said that the very manifestation or the revealing of the sons of god will actually cause the earth to be you know to experience its own jubilee amen it actually takes us to for for not the natural man to be revealed but the spiritual man in us to be made manifest and when the bride comes to her position amen then then the rapture will go and then god sets in motion now he's going to cleanse off the earth and everything so it's when the bride comes to her position then the earth is redeemed because we understand that we are in a jubilee season and in that jubilee season not only are the children of god being set free they've been liberated we have been liberated from light to darkness i mean sorry from darkness to light rather we've been liberated from sin the world false message culture religion we've been delivered from these things but it's not only the people that will be delivered or experience a jubilee but it is the world that will experience the jubilee and because we have been set free then the world is not far away from its own being set free hallelujah so now i want to let's just go to luke chapter four i just want to try and uh lay a bit of a foundation if i may but we see that you know the word always comes to the prophet it says in amos 3 7. we understand that the lord will do nothing until he reveals it to his servants the prophets and so it takes a prophet to place us in the word where we are i mean because people have been wondering for you know down through the church age they came out of darkness they made bible schools and they were you know looking to see when certain scriptures will be fulfilled but it's not man's mind that can put together where we are in the word or where we are in history but it takes a prophet to stand upon the earth and he points to certain scriptures and say this is where you are amen this is where you are on your you're on the timeline or on the roadmap this is where you are and jesus in luke chapter 4 and we'll just read this from verse 16. you know jesus he you know stands up and he begins to proclaim something that no doubt many rabbi had read the same scripture and many you know no doubt people had sat down and spoke about it but there came a season when this would be fulfilled and he says and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written and he began so so he finds this place deliberately he says the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of the sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears and you understand if you go and read from isaiah when he was reading from he cut the last scripture in half because that was pertaining to a second coming so jesus was standing there and he was proclaiming now is the season i mean where people are going to be set free amen they're going to be you know healed the brokenhearted are going to be mended you know there's going to be deliverance preached to the captives the recovering of the sight to the blind to sit at liberty you know them that are bruce so he was declaring this is what's going to happen and then he began to demonstrate that scripture in his life hallelujah where the devils were cast out lepers were healed amen you know you're the man legion 1 000 demons in him he couldn't control his own life he was there in the you know you know they're in the tombs and you know no doubt he didn't start out that way i mean but he just made a wrong step maybe just got amongst the wrong you know you know group of people and then and then something came in and got a hold of his life and you i know for myself this flesh ruled me one time amen and the people hey my friends were good people you know we had a you know i thought they were good and you know they were morally they were fine they never ended up in prison or killed anyone or didn't anything like that but being under that atmosphere where i was you know i was dragged into places i didn't really want to be i mean and even i could not set myself free from the desires that were in here hallelujah but then one day i had a word i mean i heard the voice behind the voice amen the prophet speaking was more than a man i remember god spoke to me because it's not logical you think about it there's nothing you know even your church it doesn't matter how big your church is how well polished it is and how well everything's set up compared to the worldly churches we don't have anything that looks you know physically good you know there's nothing you know you don't walk in at some great big program and everything's so polished and you know there's nothing naturally that would desire what we have there's nothing natural i mean so it actually defies logic you sitting here defies logic hallelujah because really if you had your own way you know you just go to a modern church and have your cake and eat it too because there's no deliverance there's no actually surrendering yourself it's just your lip service i remember something was in you that drew you i trust hallelujah that you could see even a bunch of people in maybe a building a lot smaller and worse than this but you saw this god there there's god in these people in it and it attracted you hallelujah it defies logic because you know like new zealand there's no pressure to be a christian in new zealand there's no family pressure there's no village pressure there's no you know you can disappear out of christianity you can do whatever you want there's no pressure so it defies logic to look at something that appears to be a cult i'll use the word i mean that appears to be bondage oh you can't do this can't do that you can't you can't smoke and drink and party and do all these things can't run around with women i don't want that kind of religion that's what the natural man says but the spiritual man says that's what i'm looking for because people who are trapped in a cycle like the woman at the well they did not foresee their life would go that way the prodigal son would never have fathomed when he said to his dad i want my inheritance he would never have it would not even come near his thinking that he'd end up in a foreign land feeding unclean animals and he was in such a desperate situation that he said if i could only eat their scraps amen he would never have but life dragged him down that way hallelujah but then but then he had he had a father that was praying and i want i really want to go into these things because god uses the body you say lord save my children save my family god's going to use you amen god's going to use you he's not just going to necessarily be a bolt from the blue he only has our hands he only has our lips remember this is not just on the prophet of the five-fold ministry this is on every member of the body i mean because the same anointing that was on jesus christ amen that was on the apostles that was on brother branham that same life has come into the church amen that same life is in the bride to do the same things that he did and i'm not necessarily saying saying you know discerning the thoughts and tense of the hearts you know but there'd be a life lived amen and and everyone has their own position in the body no part of the body is greater than the other i've never seen my spleen but i think i need it i mean i've never seen some little part of me that you know but i really need that part amen christ needs every one of us amen because even even like a great big orchestra you could may think you know i'm not people don't even notice me but if you take a big orchestra you know there's the lead violinist and all these things but there's a guy in the back that you barely notice but the guy who's conducting he knows he's there and and and and the people practice for hours and things and here's this man and he just kind of gets up and he puts a suit on he drives to where they're playing and he gets his little triangle out but he's got a part that's the important thing he's got a part in the sim amen and his part is just as important as the lead violinist or the pianist whoever is because if he doesn't sound his ting i mean if he does it because sometimes you see them you know they just one time and they stand there for the rest of the maybe maybe the big symbols and that's and that's all they do and you don't really because you really focus on the violence they're playing and you're all these things you focus on the people up front but the people in the back are just as important i mean they're just as important so friends don't be weary and well-doing amen you may never be noticed or recognized publicly on the in this life but one day you'll receive a reward hallelujah brother ram said the names were called up they went up before the king of kings hallelujah and you know so don't be weary and well doing now this as we read in ii corinthians this open face he says here but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the lord this word open in the greek is actually means unveiled amen it means to unveil so now this scripture for me is this hour where god has fully unveiled himself revealed himself we're not wondering what god likes and god doesn't like in every part of life we're not stumbling well does he like this does he know like this is this pleasing is this not pleasing we know what he likes i mean he knows what he enjoys he yo we know what he doesn't like and brother branham you know to me you know the prophet would stand up and and he'd give a sermon title it's not just a sermon title he's making declaration and he would stand there in front of thousands of people or hundreds and he'd preach the sermon the mighty god unveiled before us hallelujah and he's declaring jesus is here he's unveiled himself in this generation and then when you behold him amen you are changed from glory to glory into his image hallelujah that's why we must listen to the voice amen there's transforming power in that voice amen so you know the prophet himself would stand up and he would you know there was a time when he was in a uh you know a meeting with the full gospel businessman and i know this is familiar to you know most of us and and his wife gave him a new bible and he's trying to find the text and the two pages are stuck together and then a catholic priest gets up from from you know behind him and he and then he stands up and he and he says read out of my scriptures you know god's fixing to move he basically says and then after this you know he's driving in the car wherever he was and then the lord points him back to in the synagogue and that same scene is being played out again and so and then he would preach a sermon this day this scripture is fulfilled and he would go to malachi 4 and he would identify himself in the scripture and he'd say you know luke 17 30 the son of man has been revealed and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled hallelujah and he would declare this is where we are and not only that but at the end of his ministry if you'd like to turn with me to first thessalonians because as i i said that a prophet it takes a prophet to place you in the scripture it's so important you know when when a prophet would stand up and say here you are it throws the believer into a certain expectation because not only where you're about to go to but what he's doing to you to get you to that place and we read here in first thessalonians and we have this here in 1st thessalonians chapter 4 or we'll just read verses 16. now let's read sorry from verse 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain into the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words but if we keep reading remember the next chapter is not a different thought he says but of the times and seasons brethren we have no need that i write unto you for you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night so when they shall say peace and safety and what are they saying around the world peace and safety we're going to fix it all amen then sudden destruction cometh unto them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape amen but ye but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief here all children of light and the children of the day and we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us be let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunk and are drunken in the night and he says let us but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and of the helmet the hope of salvation for god has not appointed you should say me us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ and then so he he you know you know brother brown preaches a sermon the rapture at the end of his ministry and he he begins to speak about first thessalonians chapter four and he's about to place this in this and i'm just going to read this this is from this is from the rapture message he says three things happen he says a voice a shout a trumpet has to happen before jesus appears now shout jesus does all three of them when he's descending a shout what is a shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride now god has a way of doing things and he never changes his policy he never changes he's the unchanging god at amos 3 7 he would do nothing on the earth until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets and just as certain as he promised it he'll do it now we've come through the church ages but we've promised in the last days of according to malachi 4 that there would be a return again a prophet in the land he says now notice his nature god um he says god uses that spirit five times speaking of the spirit of elijah once and elijah and elisha and john the baptist to call out the church and the remnant of the jews five times grace he says now he says if any message goes forth if it's a true message if it's a true genuine miracles of god and hangs right in that organization you know it's not of god because that thing's already declared jesus went forth and healed the sick in order to catch the eyes of the people in his message that's right it has to have something that god's going to introduce divine he's just divine healing as miracles like that just catch the eyes of the people the the main heart of its message that's what uh there's what it's what comes from in here he's trying to get favor of the people so they'll sit and listen to them see for there's some in there that's ordained to life and some of the grain wheat fell on the ground and the birds picked it up the others fell among thorns and some went on prepared ground prepared ground and brought forth the first thing is the sounding or the first thing is the trumpet a voice a shout and then a voice and then a trumpet shout a messenger getting the people reading the second is a voice of the resurrection the same voice that a loud voice in saint john 11 38 and 44 and we're going to read that soon that called lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the dead sea to be caught up with it now watch these three things take place the next is what was a trumpet a voice sorry a voice a shadow voice and a trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the feast of trumpets is the calling of the people to the feast and that'll be the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky see the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together the next thing is a resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones who died back in other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast and the heavens and the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has to lay before the sun to ripen the great combine will come by after a while the wheat will be burned the stalks but the grain will be gathered into the into its ghana see you're not blind people you're sensible people and he says and if i stood here and said these things were prejudiced i'd say i say it because it's life because i'm responsible to god for saying it and i must say it so he's saying now this is he's saying this is where you are because the message is the shout i mean he doesn't leave that up for you know just to question or maybe ponder it he just declares the message is the shout i mean the next thing is the resurrection of the dead saints but he says now he says that the church now has to ripen in the presence of the son now if you know i know there's some farmers here you know and what what dictates the time you harvest it's not just the weather it's the condition of the plant amen so it's not the it's not the farmer that dictates now is the harvest time it's actually what you see in the grain i mean so it's actually now the life when the life comes up into the grain it becomes golden it's actually the life in the grain calling to the farmer harvest me i'm ready hallelujah so it comes a time where the life in you amen when it comes to mature and remember now we are the sons of god i mean not not one day now we are we're not looking for another day another year maybe 20 years now we are the sons of god amen do not let the devil rob you and say maybe tomorrow maybe next camp or maybe next year or maybe when you get a bit older right now holy right now you are the sons of god and so he says now that the the the wheat just has to land the prince of the sun and ripen so there will come a time when the life in us not the natural life the supernatural life of god i mean comes to us maturity and then the life in us will call to him harvest me i'm ready to be to be taken hallelujah it's actually us that brings on the resurrection amen that that life that that was that was released out of the prophet because jesus said the words i speak to you are spirit and life i mean so when so when brother brown was preaching he was preaching the life of god was coming forth in that word and then when it's received in her heart of faith it produces what the word is preached it means it will produce the very life of god and a believer hallelujah so we are waiting we just have to land the presence of the sun and i'll tell you we're not green amen the bride is not green anymore amen we have come to our position brother brown makes a statement i'm sure you've probably heard these things many times said oh he said if if the church only knew her position one day she will and then the rapture will go amen and we're living in that time we're not stumbling you know if god if god has called you and you've surrendered your life you're a joint here with him amen you just got to recognize you're not you know in the old testament under the law the woman in israel were second-class citizens but then under the blood of jesus christ peter says husbands that you'd be joint heirs with your wives as a lifting i mean of the woman up to be joined here with the man in christ and god used that illustration to show you your joint ears with him amen you're not a servant woman that's beaten as we heard last night we're esther we're not a concubine amen we are we are joiners she was joining with the king everything he had she had all she had to do was speak to the king and then all of his power of authority was released all she had to do was speak to him you say well i'm just a little in you know insignificant nobody absolutely god always uses people like that he doesn't use a celebrity he doesn't use the famous people he uses the nobodies amen you are built to receive this word amen you were built to become the bride of christ and i say you already were the bride of christ you just had to recognize it amen you just have to recognize who you were so now if we are the grain and he says in other sermons he says the grain is here amen so he's not waiting for another stage of the church he's saying the grain is here and so if his member the prophet places you in the word where you are what you are and we have now we have a you know as god has been and i yeah i trust you stay with me i'm sorry if this is all a bit all over the place but you know god has he he speaks you know the prophet speaks of a spirit and evolution of the spirit and he and he's not speaking as the mod in terms of like a frog eventually turns into a man amen but but he he's talking about it as it gets greater and greater all the time and then so he begins to and then we begin to see how the bride has evolved because remember all the ones from luther all the way down they're the bride as well they'll come up as well they're part of the they're part of the same body we're part of i mean we're just living out a different part of the word and so the bride has evolved as god has been restoring his word you take luther he was you know he was the messenger to that church age and he preached that josh shall live by faith and people receive liberty out of that catholic system but he was a bad drinker and he smoked the pipe amen if if he came into one of our meetings we'd say he's got a bit to grow god sanctify that man but he was the church age messenger for that age and and he also hated the jews and all these different things amen but then when wesley came it was a it wasn't taking away from what luther brought it was adding to and god was was evolving the bride further because he preached sanctification so he preached justification the just shall live by faith and then he preached about being sanctified living a sanctified life so it was coming closer to what it was meant to be but that's not the end product and then we had the pentecostals with the restoration of the gifts amen god restored the gifts back into the church and but that wasn't the end that wasn't god was still evolving up because we you know we understand god doesn't take away from what he's done he just adds to god is a god of addition not subtraction so all the things they had back in that those times we have in its perfection because luther i mean sorry wesley preach a method of sanctification that's why they're called methodists this is how you sanctify yourself but now when the life of god comes into you that cleanses you out so it's not a reformation god just does it for you brother braham says the bride is like a dove a dove doesn't need to take a bath there's an oil in it that cleanses itself out it just automatically does it you know the dove doesn't have to say oh i'm dirty i need oil work it just works amen it's there's a life in it that cleanses itself out and it's the same thing with you and my friends if the life of god is entered into you i mean there's always a cleansing the devil's always going to try and pour things into your life but there's an oil i mean there's a force that is stronger harlow that's already in you amen that can keep you cleansed so the bride the bride now you see in brother brown's life you just take the messengers brother branham he was he was the first one to come to maturity in this harvest season amen and so now he he was demonstrating his life was demonstrating how the rest of us will come forth and so he so you could say from luther to wesley to brother branham there was an evolution of the spirit where a man would be so surrendered to god a prisoner against his own will and but confess his faults confess where he did wrong be a real man amen but god could so live in his life you know just as brother tim was saying he just come out of the platform you know and people just the spirit of god would just move out you know if you haven't heard sydney jackson's testimony when when brother biscuit was interviewing him about when brother brown went to south africa you should watch it again because you hear the prophet tell about it then you hear sydney jackson it's like they're talking about two different things because brother brown in his humility he didn't want to because he was there was god used him but he didn't want to lift himself up so he almost talked it down amen so you see how he conducted himself so that was the bright and the mature form in every part of his life amen and so if that is the first part of the field to come to maturity and we understand in the book of leviticus there's the wave sheath offering and he and and brother abraham preaches the rising of the sun and he says that sheath is being waved again at the end time and what was it producing it was producing christ in him i mean to the revelation he received produced the very character of god and you can take the same with moses moses received the word in a revelation and that's why he could throw himself in the gap that's why he became the meekest man in all the earth but the scribes and pharisees they learnt the same word that moses received as revelation and they were stuffed shirts and they say wear it amen if the forerunner is going to come to anyone he'll come through us because we just got it just right and they had their clothes just right there the outward form just right so they learned it they learned the word and they became arrogant people moses received the word and he was the most meekest man in all the earth because of the revelation so the revelation produced a character in him and if that is the same back then it's sure going to be the same now i mean you say because to me this is me i don't necessarily listen to what people say god has revealed to them i do but i look at has it changed them amen because if it has changed them then it has been a real revelation hallelujah so god has been honing and molding us down amen remember you say well i don't know if i could really live up to that yeah you can not you get yourself brother brown said the greatest enemy i have is who william brown he didn't say satan he didn't say all of hell he said himself he says if i can get william branham out of the way god can do things that william brown knows nothing about amen and if that's if that is the case for the prophet it's sure the case for the bride of christ amen so there was a life on display and and that was shown because god was saying you're going to be like this not necessarily i'm not talking about the hunting and being a man in the wilderness and you know doing all and always driving a forward and all these things you know but um you know but there's some things the life he had now he makes a statement and why are people so tossed about actually sorry let's let's just read the scripture i just want to read a scripture here and from from the book of john chapter 11 because this is really where i want to get to now this is a story of lazarus man we know this very well i'm just going to read i'm just going to read we're going to read two scriptures 43 and 44 from john chapter 11. now notice as i said god only has uses your hands god uses your mouth god your uses you to work okay and not necessarily just the preachers he uses everyone okay everyone and then so he says and when he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go so you see jesus spoke the word but it was actually the disciples that loose lazarus amen the disciples were used to take the grave clothes off of lazarus and we are living in our friends where there's a lot of grave clothes amen there's a lot of grave clothes you know people say people say well you know spiritual things they say there's no such thing as spiritual things you take an actor an actor gets into the spirit of his of his uh of his role yeah now there was a man called heath ledger i'm just going to use names because i'm sure i trust if you don't know who he is god bless you if you do well i trust you don't uh don't follow what he used to do but you know he he got into the role of joker you know a batman movie he became you know you know he was as as joker and he became so engrossed in the character that he actually embodied the spirit of that character so much he committed suicide i mean because of schizophrenic you know mentally possessed i mean i mean demon-possessed character and he stepped himself into that so strongly unfortunately that spirit took him to his grief and now there's a new film coming out this year and uh and the heroes of the film are joker and all like like the villains each of those characters i read an article each of the characters have to have their own psychologist to stop them getting too much into the character because they're afraid they're afraid that they will kill themselves like he did that the spirit of that character will take them that that'll take them to an early grave now if that is if that is the negative how much more the positive i mean how much more the positive where the spirit because you can ask i'll just say brother matu when he used to be a elvis i'm sorry brother i'm just going to use you for an example i should have maybe asked he used to be an elvis impersonator you asked him what it was like after the show this is before the lord found him and set him free you ask him what it was like and then he'll begin to understand why you know you know celebrities of the world they get strung out on drugs and they try and escape this thing that's tormenting them you see people in the world they have no peace you can see it in their face there's no peace in the world why is that because they're in darkness hallelujah they're they're covered in grave clothes amen but you have what's in you that you can take those grave clothes off of them loose them and let them go hallelujah and i'm gonna and that this is not pie in the sky amen but there's ways that can be done you have to be look don't look at the situation for what it is oh this person's this way and this is no you got to look beyond hey when jesus saw legion as i said about he didn't just say oh this is a you know this man deserves this and look at his own fault and maybe it was his own fault before god opened your eyes you're walking according to the spirit of this world the prince of the power of the air whether you were sitting in it raised in a message church you are still governed by that spirit but then one day but god rich and mercy one day set you free amen and many times i know my own self it was my own fault i did what i did i mean i because i agreed to it yeah let's do this amen and whether we like it or not that's how it is but lazarus no but jesus he looked beyond his situation and he set him free there was an opportun legion had his opportunity he was a demon-possessed man that was naked living in the tombs no man could bound him but yet god gave him grace to come at his feet come down and sit at his feet and he was delivered amen that same power that same power to set the captives free is in you amen that same power is in you to set the captives free because if we say the grain is grain has come to its maturity that's more than just saying quotes and quoting scriptures and going to church it's a life it's an everyday life that is lived and that starts in the home and and it works out you got to look at the big picture you take for example and i just for some reason this just came to me you know you got to look at the root cause of everything so for example you go into the home you got a little girl she doesn't want to wear skirts anymore i want to wear shorts i want to wear pants now if you just look at the thing itself you will you will put her under your thumb you'll say you listen here this is a sanctified home to god and you're not allowed to wear that here okay that sounds all very self-righteous and good amen and sure there must be a standard but listen you got to go beyond the root what is the root what is causing that amen because if you if you find the root cause if you can find the root cause then there can be a deliverance amen and so what happens now is people are looking for identity yeah everyone is looking for a place to belong everyone is looking for a place to belong and that doesn't and we understand that that that being a believer you're burst into it there's no natural birth it's a spiritual birth so it doesn't matter who your parents are or you could trace your lineage back wherever you're going to be born again and that's the only way you'll find true belonging is when you have a real birth and so now everyone's looking for a place of belonging and you know it's a simple question why do people join a gang i'm still talking about the little girl okay but why do people join a gang motorcycle gang because they want a place of belonging they want to be accepted they want to find a place where there's a bit of you know brotherhood or whatever you know you know why do people you say well i never joined a motorcycle gang everyone's in a gang amen they might not wear a patch but everyone's in a gang you take you take gym jockeys always at the gym working out they found their place of acceptance oh you can do so many push-ups and whatever more and you know and then and they they actually find this is me you find someone who's addicted to lots of sport and stuff they've joined a gang this is their place of acceptance i mean you take computer gamers you take gamers and that's a spirit amen you take hey i used to be under that spirit but god set me free but that's a place because oh i'm not accepted with with with all the sports stars so i'll hear some people that accept me for me amen you take business people career people why do why do houses become divided families become divided because one of the spouses finds their identity in something else in in in that career or this job and they say but you know and then that will if if the ambition is wrong i mean there may be a real ambition but i want to pursue a career what's it going to do to your family what's it going to do to the rest of your life because you've only got 24 hours in a day we all need to sleep at some time amen and so if you pursue something something's going to suffer i mean something will suffer if you pursue something and so but then some people well then what happens is now there's division in the family but then these people at work accept me what happens they've joined a gang corporate people you know and that's the same thing with religion people join a gang why do you think churches are seeker friendly because while we're accepting jesus is always accepting but he doesn't leave you how you are the woman caught an adultery she said he said where's your accusers she says lord i have none he says neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more whenever someone was delivered he said go and sin no more amen so you know some people they just but it's you know it's a gang so now you've got to look at now why is my child doing certain things because they see at school or maybe they're friends oh they can do these things amen and maybe they feel that those children are more loved than your children and so what happened they'll gravitate towards the other family because they want to have what they have amen so you've got to look at the root cause of it the root cause is not they want to be rebellious but they're looking for identity amen now if you can look beyond the circumstances jesus looked beyond the brother branham here's the prophet of god raise the dead thousands healed in south africa one time one prayer you know all these all these tremendous things spoke a storm out of existence life was created life was given back power spoken word and then he comes in home sister meters all uh fluctuated there's people in the house waiting to see brother barum young kids are all fussing and you know all crying and hungry and you know he goes in there remember this is this is this is a mature part of the field this is a mature part of the field and then so the house is in all disarray and uh you know meters oh there's all these people in the house that you know we haven't had anything to eat all day the children all upset all these things and he's just praying in his heart lord change the atmosphere in the home send in your holy ghost now change everything and he just just doesn't stand there and pray he's practicing his heart he puts on an apron remember he's looking at the big picture because if he was now reminded say a woman sort out these kids that's your office to look after these children sort it out that's what he yo someone who's just narrow-minded in their vision because you know but he looked you know put on an apron he says honey i saw a dress downtown oh yeah you look so nice in it and he begins to do the dishes and then what happens soon the kids start to settle down now mida became a little bit yo was all relaxed again what happened i could say this and i hope i'm not going too far with this but satan was trying to put grave clothes on a family because grave clothes bind they hold people that's why the body you know because they didn't have uh coffins like we do they bind up the body and then they put it in the tomb amen so now if he came into the home as i said and just laid down the law well the family would have been bound up amen so here was a man remember this is and brother makes a statement he says the anointing says why are people so tossed about he says and now we would think if such an anointing was on him he had been prophesied 800 years before uh that it would come and here he was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the lord was upon him we would have to now we would have uh we would have want to run all over the buildings holla but the bible said he laid down the scroll remember we read that and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth that's what he'd done under the anointing the anointing is not emotion but remember anything without emotion is dead amen the anointing is not a motion the anointing is supreme power and control knowing exactly what and how so i say when the prophet came into his home there that was that was the anointing was there supreme power's under control to know knowing exactly what and how to do amen sometimes we think it's some big great and it is sometimes god pours the spirit you can barely do anything but most of the time you say well i'm anointed that's supreme power under control amen that in every situation in life the lord will say this is what it is amen this is what's going on here amen you know you see people if they uh i'll just say it many times we see sisters and they want to be really dressed up and they should be you know look pretty but sometimes it can be done because they're scared the husband will look at worldly women amen and will cause him to leave her so she begins to dress the wrong way because she's afraid that he will leave amen and then now if the if the husband wants her to actually you'd say dress modestly according to the word he's not actually identifying the root cause amen because the root cause is not because she's wanting to be worldly the root causes she's afraid he'll leave is this okay amen you've got to look at you've got to look at the root cause of it all amen because remember what god the husband is like god and the woman the the wife is like the bride amen god jesus he gave himself for us and there was a purpose that he gave himself it says in titus 2 and 14 who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto him a peculiar people zealous of good works in galatians 1 4 who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father so now it's their husband's responsibility now to do that for his family remember you loose them and you let them go amen you lose them and so now we don't have to die jesus died but there will be a life in us remember if if he is in us then he will want to redeem those that are lost through you brother makes a statement in in return in jubilee he says about a kinsmen redeemer he says a kinsmen redeemer picks up their bible goes out into the night to their lost brother to redeem them amen so he's not just saying jesus is our kingdom and redeemer he says you become a kinshin redeemer amen you can go to those who have the same spirit amen and you can actually be their kins and redeemer you can loose the grave clothes amen oh lord save them deliver them and god says you go i'm insufficient no you're not moses said that amen he said did i not make man's mouth to speak hallelujah amen that we have the ability to set people free but you have to look for what is really causing that amen so brother bradham he did some unusual things one guy was he couldn't he couldn't kick smoking so you got another brother to buy this guy a box of cigarettes amen and the guy was delivered you know you may think well that's pretty out of the box god is out of the box you got to be led don't be afraid if you're led however god speaks to you just let him lead you don't be afraid and now so god heals in many ways remember because spiritual he'd say complexes or emotional wounds are often a lot harder to heal than physical wounds amen because a physical wound it begins to get well and it doesn't really bother you anymore but a spiritual wound can be healed but then the scar can plague you amen and to me that's a grave cloth amen remember lazarus was alive he wasn't dead anymore he was life in him but he was bound up by these things amen and he he he he walked out of the tomb but i imagine he probably couldn't walk all that well because he was bound up amen and some of us amen are walking but we're not walking like we really could walk if we weren't bound amen and we understand you know you know what you're wrestling he knew he was bound up amen and you know what you wrestle with it doesn't make you less of a believer i mean lazarus was absolutely a believer i believe he's in the upper room amen he just went to the other side and saw abraham isaac and jacob and they wanted to kill him again he was like hey sure i don't want to be here amen because he knew he'd no doubt go back to their place so he was a believer but just because he was in that condition didn't mean he was less of a believer and sometimes we kind of get in our mind well if i'm really the bride i'll be always victorious i'll crest every wave sometimes you've got a submarine it doesn't mean you're less of a believer amen it doesn't mean you're weak in faith you know you read abraham you read the divine commentary of people's lives paul picks up paul picks up abraham he staggered not at the promise of god was strong giving praise that he was able to do that which he has promised you know the scripture but then you go back into abraham's life he backslid amen nearly you know nearly caused plagues to fall in egypt and all these places when he went down to guerrero in another place and the and the king wanted to marry his wife and before they went down abraham said tell her you know you know tell them that you're my sister and then one of the you know and then so the next day you know the king was going to marry sarah and god said to him you're dead man you're in your house what have i done you're going to marry my prophet you know you're going to marry a you know that is his wife he says i haven't you know i didn't he said you know that their sis you know brother and sister and you know and then so it was actually the king was more righteous than abraham a heathen king was more righteous than god's prophet brother abraham actually no god says to other kings he's my prophet get him to pray for you amen and we're the sons and daughters of abraham by faith amen think about it and so you have all his stumblings and his failings and all these different things and then here we are and we're exactly we're men and women we're human like he was human amen he had his faith oh you say well that was before calvary well god but we still live the same kind of life but god doesn't remember remember moses under the blood of bulls and goats could write about all of their failings and weaknesses but paul under the blood of christ could not write those same failings and weaknesses amen but they are they were flesh and blood like we're flesh and blood oh but we have the holy ghost we still fail brother i don't have the quote on me but i think it's in the lamb's book of life brother brown says god doesn't run his business haphazardly he wouldn't save you one day to lose you another day and he says he knew he he knows you'll fail and fall but he still saved you he's not a haphazard god amen so if so if the prophet if we can take that for ourselves well how much more can we take it for each other amen for our families amen can we take that same because we can take then say thank you lord i i'm you know even though i fail and the lord traps me i mean i mean the devil traps me and all kinds of things and you forgive me amen and then and then you and then it comes down to your family oh they did this and i can't really trust them because they did this and all these different things happen you know if you're forgiven you can forgive amen and that's why some people do not understand how others forgive others is because they're not forgiven they don't know they're forgiven yet amen so yo the merciful shall receive mercy you've got to look at the big picture oh someone's someone's struggling what's happening they're looking for identity and they're not going to you know love breaks down all barriers amen and many times we can put forth a front and then people are actually repelled by that front and then your children will do not want what you have because of a front amen the message there's nothing wrong with the message quite often it's actually how it's given many times it's how it's lived god is a god of love jesus was god's attribute of love and he gave and he didn't just say well i love him on everyone's fine he gave himself to deliver them amen and if that same life is in you you'll give yourself that people will be delivered it may take many it may take maybe an innocent may take a long time but look for the root cause of it all amen look for the root cause of it all because this is our and i'm just gonna i've no idea what the time is but i'm just gonna wind this down but he says you know he says an apple tree remember if we uh if we are remember the grain that is planted is the same grain that's grown they're not a different grain the grain that's planted is actually no greater than the one that's harvested it's exactly the same thing i mean a husband a man a woman married because they're the same species amen jesus is looking for a part of himself the feminine part of himself so he's not looking just for people he's looking for a part of himself amen so if god and well how do i how do i know that he says my sheep know my voice a stranger they'll not follow i mean there's something in you that resonates when you hear the word and that and then brother baby makes a statement the bridegroom call will come right through this amen he says he says an apple tree the apple he says so i'll find where this is this is an um don't find the page this isn't the impartiable sin 54 he says if a man says that he believes he must be a christian and walk in the way that he says he is see attribute the apple is not the tree it's the earth it's the attribute of the tree and because you lie steal cheat and smoke and do everything call yourself a christian is because you're not born again that's right it shows that that's the right kind of life you bear jesus said buy their fruits you shall know them you say that's pretty cutting but that's true the apple is the attribute of the tree amen so the life that is produced proves it's an apple tree amen and i'm not saying you must have everything perfect but you should look if we're being changed from glory to glory we become more like him and what did he do he gave himself he wasn't selfish he didn't say well i've got to live my life he gave us life amen as soon as he came into the ministry he just gave his life as the lamb amen and it didn't it didn't actually bother him he knew well i'll just say it this way he knew those would be in the upper room amen he knew those that would receive him later but many of the people that he healed were never in the upper room many of the people that were delivered didn't become believers and brother braham said i'll pray for anyone i remember all adam's race he didn't he didn't actually say well no they're not bride forget about it amen so it's the same thing with you people can come to you and they can ask you things and they'll have questions and you have a life in you that'll just give a word in season and that'll turn the whole course of their life amen i'm talking about every part of the body now amen do not think of what to say it's not like you're brought before trial but you don't need to think of what to say god will just drop it in your heart say this and even even many times god does things and it's only later we recognize it's god amen you take you take brother biscuit there with the uh you know they're hunting the grizzly and the cariboo with the 42-inch horns he is and and and brother brown tells him the whole version how it's all going to work out days before uh you know a young man in a green checkered shirt and that was brother biscuit and he had no idea that he was actually part of the vision and it was only at the end where he says there it is his brother and he's and then he and then he realized hey this is it we just lived out part of the word amen oh but that's that's that now you're the same many times because god the the faith that we have is the subconscious faith the life that we live is just it's just lived out amen so now if we if that is the sa yo if that is the case now you know we have i you know maybe i've just ran around the tree too many times but you know you have what you need to loose people amen you have it he told his disciples lose him let him go amen you got to recognize that god is god is waiting on you amen he's not waiting on someone else he's waiting on you well i just live in the back part of nowhere no one knows you he's waiting on you amen and god heals by love he heals by music he heals just by the preaching of his word you know he heals by prayer laying out of hands all different kinds of things god heals by these things you say there's a person that they just need god needs to deal with them and then many times we think well we've just got to give them the word how do you give them the word do you just quote scripture to them or or or quotes how you doing how's your day you know you know brother branham he was he was there and i uh said remember this is the anointing supreme power under control everyday things they're there in a restaurant the waitress is all grumpy and moody and huffy and all these things you know terrible service and he just says well maybe she just had a bad day oh no it can't be that natural absolutely and just gives her a five dollar tip or whatever it is the next time comes in how are you doing have a seat here we go amen amen oh that's the prophet the same life is in you i mean can you put yourself in someone else's shoes amen because normally we would think man the service the whoever's the manager is doesn't train these people right and this is all wrong and he just said maybe she just had a bad day amen and then someone you say this person needs a real correction you say well give them the word go up to them how you doing how's everything going welcome so good to see you amen isn't the lord wonderful amen great nap just just just talk to them love them love them amen because if you cause an outward conformity the end part's not changed amen but if love is prejudice projected sovereign grace steps in amen oh that's brother branham no it's you that was demonstrated to prove god is going to do in you amen you can't put these stories just on the prophet amen you got to put it on yourself when love is projected i'm sorry hornets i didn't mean to bump your you know bump where you're living so simple things but supernatural things amen hallelujah so you know you've got to look at the big picture what is your vision remember where there's no vision isn't i'm going to close with this where no vision is the people perish the scripture says and that's just not well we're taking a rapture okay we are taking a rapture well i want my family there okay i want my family there well then what are you if you don't have a vision how that's going to take place well then how are you going to get there amen i said i want to fly to canada well i need money and i need a ticket now i need to book the ticket you can't just say i want to fly to canada you got to have everything in place to get there so if you look at the big picture now because remember satan all he wants to do this is what satan wants to do have us all divorced that are married amen he wants all of our children on drugs or committed suicide someplace that's what he wants for you that's what satan's wanting to do amen but what is god wanting to do because remember jesus said to peter the satan has desired to sift you but i have prayed amen that when your temptation comes he's going to say he's going to try and sift you it's still going to happen but he says i have prayed that when he tries that you will not fail amen so god said no this is not going to happen and there's a prayer line where a young woman comes in and i don't have the quote on that but but a young girl a young woman comes in front of the prophet and he says it's just time of life and all these things and i think she's got cancer and all these things and and he praises satan has desired to sift her but we've prayed now and it's over amen and so it's the same thing in families satan will try and sift you and destroy you we don't fight an imaginary you know i'm sure we can all agree yeah we all know the devil is real amen that's not a debate and if he is real therefore he has an intent and that is to destroy you to have you isolated amen to destroy your families but then if you have a vision my family is going to be there we're all going to be there on that day then you say lord help me to live a life that will draw my family i mean draw my family into that place that they take a rapture i don't want my family to go up in the second resurrection before the great white throne if they receive mercy then praise the lord but i want them to go on a rapture amen that is that is we say that's too how could that ever happen try it pray for them god's waiting for you abraham abraham said to god before god was going to burn psalm gomorrah you won't destroy the city if you find 50. he's actually telling him you will not do it amen you go read the story and then the number goes down and down and down so actually abraham standing in the breach for a heathen city just for a few righteous people there and he says god you're not going to do it amen and god actually began to agree with them down and down but then there's only three that came out hello sons and daughters of abraham amen lord you won't destroy them remember god only has our hands there might be you might be the only one praying for your family or praying for a friend or whoever it is god sees the prayer god's waiting for you to pray amen amen and this is the position that we've been called to be in if the bride only knew what she was in the rap she would go we are bone of his bone life of his life power of his power spirit of his spirit she is him the same life that was in him as in you just exercise that life i mean put it into action amen you see someone and and sorry if the musicians should come i'm just talking but you see someone you got to recognize that's grave clothes if they're not walking like they should be walking or if they're an unbelief whatever it is that's grave clothes amen you've got to look at the big picture remember husband and wife should be one and everything amen and remember the enemy is never your spouse the enemy is never your children the enemy is not even the kids that your kids that your children hang around with the enemy is the devil amen and you must look at it in that way amen the enemy is not is not the person talking to you amen because of remember ultimately who's going to put people in and out not you amen in this life you're not going to say well no they've just crossed it amen it's god who puts people in and out jesus never wanted to put people out amen amen the scribes and pharisees manifested what they were he says because my word has no place in you but his judgment was always right amen where to be mercy to this earth that people can be set free amen this is our commission because if if the rest of the bride is not set free we're stuck amen that's right and i pray that when you see people or your children you recognize they're part of the same body i mean because god doesn't like division amen he wants all of himself together all of his attributes together so we should strive for that kind of unity around the word amen now there's a kindred there's a witness that you know that's the son of god that's a daughter of god amen because if the body is united then we can move forward amen amen let's just pray let's just be our heads gracious lord father i've probably been a bit laboring in this but lord i just asked you would help us father you commissioned the disciples to loose loose lazarus and let him go and father we see in life lord there's even no doubt people sitting here father that are bound by things father and our families and people around us lord you want us to do something father we pray many times for you to step upon the scene but lord we're part of you and you dwell in us by your grace and father i just prayed lord as we lord i just asked you to take this chopped up little sermon and put it together how it should have been and i just pray oh god that we would look at situations different now father when we see our family our children dear god may we see it's not them they're looking for a place of belonging and lord we know that that real place the only place they'll find peace is in you father help us our god to to take the grave clothes off with love lord with music with words with understanding dear god with your word oh god may we be like the prophet lord father same life that was in him is in us and dear god may we see you on display in a greater way father among us lord may you grant that please we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen amen let's just uh let's just sing sorry sorry what were you playing amen let's just sing mercy rewrote my life i know there's a different kind of service but if you want prayer you're welcome amen but let's just sing this mercy wrote our life remember if you've been forgiven you can forgive amen amen if you've truly been forgiven hey remember jesus he just wiped it clean he didn't make you do purgatory or do some penance or something it's gone it's gone and then many times we say the devil brings it back he say lord forgive me he's saying what are you talking about what are you talking about i don't where's my book no your slide is clean and then many times we hold things over people that's right we shouldn't hold things over people if they've confessed it out of a right heart it's gone amen it's gone and then god can use you to restore that person amen amen that's right hallelujah let's just stand and sing this o mercy god's mercy rewrote my life oh i should have fallen my soul cast down but mercy rewrote my life oh mercy my love oh god's mercy rewrote my i should have fallen my soul one more time oh god's mercy rewrote my life rerolled my life i should have fallen my soul cast down mercy rewrote my amen let's sing i want to live the way he wants me to live hallelujah do you love him this morning amen just hey just try it once amen you watch god come upon the scene hallelujah i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love no more love i could never ever out love the lord i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love oh love there's just no more love i could never ever hey can we just sing can we just think of amaze that you love me amen amen amen let's just sing this uh mma oh you've got the chorus first oh that you love me i'm amazed how you can and my sins are they're all washed away all my sins are washed away oh no one knew how alone i was feeling i was covering up the secrets then one day someone told me of your mercy and the luck you showed on a hill called calvary there you died and purchased my redemption when you broke sins pal and set my spirit free i'm amazed that you love me i'm amazed how you care through your precious yes it's true there have been days lord you know the many times i've gone astray but i've learned your love is stronger than my weakness and your ear is open every time i pray no one else i'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow knowing you are everything i'll ever i'm amazed that you love me and i'm amazed and my sins are washed they're all washed away all my sins are washed away i believe i believe that you love me i believe through your precious is that you love you me through your precious i believe i believe that you love me i believe and my sins are washed they're all washed away i mean you're dismissed in jesus christ's name but let's just sing how deep the father's love for us i mean how great the golf that god did spend to come where i lay helpless he wants to use you to golf a span amen to where some remember people can't free themselves they can't deliver themselves god has to come and deliver and he's going to use you amen remember just go what about what did brother ram say just go live a simple christian life don't try and be something just walk with god amen remember if you're the bride you've got the ring on your finger he said you got that ring already on your finger before the foundation of the world you don't have to try and evolve yourself into something he just makes you what you are and just walk with god amen walk with god amen amen the father's love for us how bounce beyond the measure that he would give his only son to make his treasure the father turns his face away glory upon his shoulders among the staffers it was my sin that held him there until it was his dying breath has brought i know that it is how great the gold that god is as he declares how is me as his purchase i will not boast in anything no gifts no power no wisdom but i will boast in jesus christ his death and resurrection why should i gain from his reward but this is i mean let's go back to how great the golf of god did spend amen hallelujah how great through tears i see his outstretched hands as he declares me guiltless how great the love that sought me out how infinite is i will not post in anything no gifts but i will boast in jesus christ his death and resurrection i cannot given his wounds have paid hallelujah amen glory amen god bless you friends you're dismissed in jesus christ's name i know into your presence foreign i'm captured yourself oh me me beautiful wonderful savior i know for sure in your head you gently call me into your presence guiding me by your holy spirit teach me set me apart i know you're drawing me to yourself leave me lord i pray take me you got me me i give my life take me i give my life me walk beside me you
