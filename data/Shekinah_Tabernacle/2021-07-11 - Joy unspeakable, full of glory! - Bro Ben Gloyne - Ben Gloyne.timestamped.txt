[4:33] god bless you all this morning
[4:36] welcome to the house of god it's good to
[4:38] be it's good to be here
[4:40] i was um didn't make it to the service
[4:42] on wednesday
[4:44] um but i um i was actually asleep when
[4:47] it started because i was quite sick but
[4:49] i watched it a little ways through and
[4:51] when i was watching
[4:53] i think brother um there was a message
[4:56] on there brother ben was
[4:57] spoke a little bit afterwards and i felt
[4:59] in my heart that i wanted to be there
[5:02] i thought i actually really want to
[5:03] really want to be there like looking at
[5:05] it and thinking
[5:06] i want to be in that place rather than
[5:08] sitting here and um
[5:11] that made me feel a bit like a christian
[5:12] actually
[5:14] [Music]
[5:15] when it's a natural feeling that comes
[5:16] up you think well i felt that i didn't
[5:18] actually work hard to feel it it just
[5:19] went pop
[5:20] there it was you don't have to try and
[5:23] think oh no i should be there because
[5:25] brother branham said you know
[5:26] if we're a real believer we can't wait
[5:28] for those church doors to open yonder
[5:30] and be there
[5:31] you know but it's nice when it just
[5:33] comes up and you think you know the
[5:34] lord's
[5:34] i said to shannon afterwards you know
[5:36] the lord's done something in my life
[5:38] somehow because i that just came up
[5:40] naturally it wasn't
[5:42] it was a thought that was within my
[5:43] heart so i'm glad that the lord is
[5:48] he's like a master builder in our life
[5:50] and he just works
[5:52] in mysterious ways in ways that we can't
[5:54] understand and he works in our life
[5:58] and he's actually doing things all the
[5:59] time it's like if you have a computer
[6:02] you know you see the screen and there
[6:03] might be like three two windows opened
[6:05] up you're doing a little bit of stuff
[6:06] but that computer
[6:07] is always buzzing and there's always a
[6:09] lot of stuff going on
[6:10] things are being updated it's just it's
[6:12] working real hard you can't see it
[6:13] though you just see
[6:14] your little screen whatever app you've
[6:16] got open or something but
[6:18] and you don't know what it's doing in
[6:19] the background and that's what it's like
[6:20] with the lord you know when we commit
[6:21] our life to the lord he's faithful
[6:23] he's always working changing us and
[6:26] doing little things all the time
[6:28] and we've got no idea what's going on
[6:29] but he's just doing it good and then
[6:31] until one day you have that thought pop
[6:32] up and you think well where'd that come
[6:33] from
[6:34] that was just the lord he's been working
[6:36] somewhere and changing me

[42:50] then the soldiers of the governor took
[42:52] jesus out into the common hall and
[42:54] gathered under him the whole band of
[42:56] soldiers
[42:57] and they stripped him and put on him a
[42:59] scarlet robe
[43:00] and when they platted a crown of thorns
[43:02] they put it upon his head and a reed in
[43:04] his right hand and they bowed the knee
[43:06] before him and mocked him
[43:08] saying hail king of the jews and they
[43:10] spit upon him and they took the reed and
[43:12] smote him on the head
[43:13] and after that they had mocked him they
[43:15] took the robe off of him and put on his
[43:17] own raiment on him
[43:18] and led him away to crucify him and as
[43:21] they
[43:21] came out they found a man of cyrene
[43:24] simon by name
[43:25] and they compelled him to bear his cross
[43:27] and when they were coming to a place
[43:29] called golgotha
[43:30] there is to say a place of a skull they
[43:32] gave him vinegar to drink mingle with
[43:34] gall
[43:35] and when he had tasted thereof and when
[43:37] he had tasted thereof he would not drink
[43:40] and they crucified him and parted his
[43:41] garments casting lots that they
[43:43] that might be fulfilled which was spoken
[43:45] by the prophet they parted my garments
[43:47] among them
[43:48] and upon my vesture did they cast lots
[43:50] and sitting down they watched him
[43:52] there and they sit over his head his
[43:55] accusation written
[43:56] this is jesus the king of the jews and
[44:00] then there were two thieves crucified
[44:02] with him
[44:03] one on the right hand and one on
[44:06] the left amen and we're going to go to
[44:10] nehemiah and read from
[44:11] nehemiah 8 and verse 10 just just one
[44:15] this may seem a bit uh
[44:18] we'll just see how it ties together
[44:22] um nehemiah 8 and 10.
[44:27] i just want to take the last part of
[44:28] this first but we'll just read the whole
[44:30] whole
[44:30] whole scripture here near my 8 and 10.
[44:33] this is nehemiah
[44:35] speaking to the people of israel after
[44:37] they had read the law to them and
[44:39] he says here then he said unto them

[44:46] and send portions
[44:47] unto them for whom nothing is prepared
[44:49] for this day is holy unto our lord

[46:37] bless you friends you may have your
[46:38] seats this morning
[46:39] i want to um take a bit of a thought you
[46:41] know brother brown he makes
[46:43] uh you know i was i was reading through
[46:45] the message that day on calvary
[46:48] and brother brown makes some incredible
[46:50] statements in there if you haven't
[46:51] listened to that message recently go
[46:52] listen to it again
[46:54] you know we read here you know we have
[46:56] joy unspeakable full of glory you know
[46:58] there's a reality to the christian walk
[47:00] it's not all on our mind it's not just a
[47:02] mental illusion
[47:03] i mean but there's a reality of having a
[47:05] real joy of the lord
[47:06] you know there's a reality of having a
[47:08] peace that passes all understanding you
[47:10] know this is a real gospel we believe
[47:12] you know this message is
[47:13] is the true and living gospel it's not
[47:15] some man's idea it's not some culture
[47:17] that we adapt to but it's god and flesh
[47:19] amen that you know that the lord we want
[47:21] to take his word and come and live in
[47:22] our lives now
[47:24] we serve the true and living god now i
[47:26] know this is probably not foreign to us
[47:27] we shouldn't be shocked by those kind of
[47:29] statements but
[47:30] you know our god meets every need you
[47:32] know he's here he's here in this end
[47:34] time to gather his elect he's here to
[47:35] fight our battles
[47:37] amen he's here amen to redeem to restore
[47:40] to renew
[47:40] our god he's here to keep us in our
[47:42] first love amen
[47:44] he is he is determined that he'll have a
[47:46] bride that does not become
[47:47] cold lukewarm formal and powerless amy
[47:50] but she will be the final
[47:52] voice of the final age where god will
[47:53] take a people and speak his word through
[47:55] them
[47:56] i mean it will not be their own thoughts
[47:57] their own ideas it will be god
[47:59] expressed i mean his word expressed amen
[48:02] because we believe
[48:04] amen that we have been restored to the
[48:06] gospel of saint paul
[48:08] i mean so we've been restored to a bible
[48:10] gospel to a bible doctrine
[48:12] to a bible christianity to a bible holy
[48:15] ghost i mean not another spirit but the
[48:17] spirit of the lord jesus christ
[48:19] now i love it where the lord
[48:22] he hears our cries and there's one
[48:24] scripture that um
[48:26] that that that blessed me uh this week
[48:28] was in in
[48:29] exodus where where the lord speaks to
[48:32] moses he says i've come down
[48:34] i've heard the cries of he says and the
[48:36] lord said unto him i've been
[48:38] i have surely seen the affliction of my
[48:39] people which in egypt
[48:41] and have heard their cry by the reason
[48:43] of their task masters for i know their
[48:45] sorrows
[48:46] so he says i've heard their cry and i
[48:48] say he's he's heard outcry
[48:50] he hears our cries i mean for the reason
[48:53] the things that afflict us and he knows
[48:54] our sorrows
[48:55] he's not unmindful of what goes on in
[48:57] our lives
[48:59] amen he says i've heard their cry and
[49:01] this incredible thing when god hears
[49:02] our prayer hallelujah amen now
[49:07] we're just going to have a smorgasbord
[49:08] today but i trust that there'll be a
[49:11] pattern through this somewhere but you
[49:12] know
[49:12] i just want to continue on from last
[49:14] week where where brother brown makes a
[49:16] statement
[49:16] he says now remember this the church
[49:18] christ and the true church is a
[49:20] continuation of the book of acts
[49:22] right so remember the book of acts was
[49:24] the acts of the holy ghost and the
[49:25] apostles
[49:26] it wasn't the acts of human people it
[49:28] was the acts of the holy ghost in them
[49:30] that did those things but the book of
[49:32] revelation shows how the antichrist
[49:34] spirit will come into the church
[49:36] and defile it making it lukewarm formal
[49:38] and powerless we know lukewarm means and
[49:40] webster tells us to lack conviction
[49:43] right
[49:44] so it'll make us it'll try and make us
[49:45] lukewarm formal and powerless
[49:47] it exposes satan revealing his works
[49:49] which are the attempted destruction of
[49:51] god's people
[49:52] and the discrediting of god's word right
[49:54] down to the time he's cast in the lake
[49:56] of fire
[49:57] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[49:58] knows that if the people get the true
[50:00] revelation of the true church and what
[50:01] she is
[50:02] and what she stands for and that she can
[50:05] do the greater work
[50:06] she will be an invincible army so that
[50:08] being an invincible army
[50:10] is unconquerable you cannot be you
[50:12] cannot be defeated in the
[50:14] in the campaign you may lose a battle
[50:15] here and there but you'll win the war
[50:17] hallelujah so she'll be in a a people
[50:20] that cannot be conquered now
[50:23] we live you know it's very important
[50:26] that we say what the spirit says
[50:28] now after every letter to every church
[50:30] age it says to him that have an ear hath
[50:32] here let him hear what the spirit says
[50:34] into the church
[50:35] but it's very important that we speak
[50:37] what the spirit says
[50:38] right it's it's absolutely vital we do
[50:40] not speak what another spirit says
[50:42] because remember a a word is a thought
[50:45] expressed
[50:46] and a thought comes from an inspiration
[50:48] right and either comes from heaven or
[50:49] from hell
[50:50] there's two sources of inspiration
[50:51] there's not a whole bunch of smorgasbord
[50:53] this too
[50:54] right so so the words we speak they're
[50:57] inspired
[50:57] from two places and now if we tell
[51:00] ourselves there's nothing to this
[51:03] it's a whole bunch of emotional work up
[51:05] that's why people look at these they say
[51:06] it's just emotion
[51:07] these people just get a bit excited
[51:09] there's no reality to it it's just a
[51:10] mental workup
[51:11] that's a lie of the devil i mean there's
[51:14] a reality to this
[51:15] i mean there's a real joy a real peace a
[51:17] real shout a real dance
[51:19] i mean that the that the lord gives
[51:21] because of revelation
[51:22] hallelujah so now he'll try and always
[51:25] so the devil will
[51:26] try and tell us things and he wants us
[51:28] to speak his thoughts
[51:31] amen but so but we shouldn't speak what
[51:33] he says we should speak what the spirit
[51:36] has said to us amen so we want to
[51:39] we are called to hear what the holy
[51:41] ghost is saying
[51:42] and speak that it's very important we
[51:45] speak what the word says about you
[51:47] you don't speak what the devil says
[51:49] about you if you look at the bible it's
[51:51] full of a whole bunch of nobodies
[51:53] you know the the the outwash the out and
[51:55] out not the up-and-ups it was the it was
[51:57] the unlikelies that became the heroes of
[51:58] faith
[51:59] i mean david was such an unlikely his
[52:01] father didn't pick him to come before
[52:03] samuel but his other brothers were
[52:04] picked but that was god's king
[52:06] right there hallelujah you know you take
[52:08] moses a runaway prophet there the backs
[52:10] are the dares that he thought he was he
[52:12] had gone too far gone too long but god
[52:14] had not changed his mind about him
[52:16] amen the woman at the well was the
[52:18] unlikely
[52:19] hallelujah amen she wasn't one of the
[52:22] you know
[52:23] whatever people in society she was she
[52:25] was an outcast of society but god said
[52:27] no that's one of my seed
[52:29] and i've got to go find her hallelujah
[52:31] peter j peter james and john
[52:33] they weren't in the in the inner circle
[52:34] of the sanhedrin in the religious world
[52:36] they were fishermen
[52:37] but yet one was ordained to have the
[52:39] keys to the kingdom
[52:41] hallelujah so god uses the unlikely now
[52:44] this word joy or rather let's go here
[52:46] first so we need to speak
[52:49] what the spirit says to the church it's
[52:52] very and and and the spirit always
[52:54] speaks the word of god
[52:56] it's not adding or taking away from the
[52:57] word it is the word
[52:59] right the spirit of god will always
[53:00] direct us into the scripture
[53:02] won't take us out of the scripture it'll
[53:04] take us into the scripture that's why
[53:05] this message to me is the holy ghost
[53:08] speaking because it takes us back into
[53:10] the scripture where does it take us back
[53:11] into scriptural baptism in the name of
[53:13] lord jesus christ
[53:14] scriptural repentance a scriptural new
[53:16] birth a scripture way to dress and act
[53:18] and
[53:18] you know conduct ourselves and our
[53:20] families in a church in society it takes
[53:23] us back into that
[53:25] amen amen
[53:29] so he says here he will be definitely
[53:31] this is satan he'll be definitely
[53:33] thought to today as when christ will
[53:34] stood his every effort to gain power
[53:36] over him in the desert
[53:37] yes satan hates revelation but we love
[53:40] it with true revelation in our lives the
[53:42] gates of hell
[53:43] cannot prevail against us but we will
[53:45] prevail
[53:46] over them so there is a there is a
[53:49] unconquerable force in revelation it
[53:52] cannot be conquered
[53:53] i mean it could not be conquered when
[53:55] god came down to moses and said i've
[53:56] heard the cry of my people
[53:58] and i've come down to deliver them i'm
[54:00] sending you to do the job
[54:01] moses could not be conquered when that
[54:03] revelation anchored into his soul
[54:05] that this is my job description i'm
[54:06] going to do what god has told me to do
[54:08] and god's gonna back me up it's not me
[54:10] fighting the battle
[54:11] but god's come down to fight the battle
[54:13] for me he wasn't defeated
[54:15] he wasn't defeated in the palace he
[54:17] wasn't defeated when they crossed the
[54:18] red sea
[54:19] he wasn't defeated at sinai any trouble
[54:21] that came in he was
[54:22] he wasn't defeated why because he's
[54:24] walking by that revelation
[54:25] i mean the apostle paul when he met god
[54:27] on the road to damascus
[54:29] i mean none of none of the churches or
[54:31] or religious spirits around her culture
[54:33] could conquer him
[54:35] doesn't matter if he was in prison he
[54:36] didn't quit he praised god
[54:38] didn't matter if he was shipwrecked or
[54:40] got bitten by the adder or whatever it
[54:42] was
[54:42] beaten you know had to run or whatever
[54:44] you know things that happened to him
[54:46] nothing conquered that revelation and a
[54:48] soul i mean because he was committed i
[54:50] met god
[54:51] i mean when he stood before king agrippa
[54:53] he was in physical change but physical
[54:55] chains aren't the problem it's spiritual
[54:57] chains of unbelief
[54:58] that's the problem he even said to king
[55:00] agrippa i wish you were like me
[55:02] except for these bonds i mean so who was
[55:04] really the prisoner
[55:05] it wasn't paul i mean it was king of
[55:07] gripper and all those
[55:08] all those people who thought they were
[55:10] something but they had nothing because
[55:11] they didn't have christ they were lost
[55:13] and they should have really said paul i
[55:14] want one you have
[55:16] be merciful to me so nothing stopped
[55:20] him because revelation prevailed
[55:24] even even when they said we're going to
[55:26] cut off your head in the morning boy
[55:28] sharpening the axe right now he said
[55:29] death death where's your sting grave
[55:31] where's your victory thanks be to god
[55:33] that gives me the victory
[55:34] amen he wasn't he you know he didn't
[55:36] shrink back he said well
[55:37] maybe my purpose is done i've i've run a
[55:41] good race i've fought a good fight i've
[55:42] kept the faith
[55:43] and there's a crown of life awaiting me
[55:46] and not only just me but all those that
[55:48] love his glorious appearing
[55:51] hallelujah now where nehemiah said about
[55:54] joy
[55:56] you know this word joy if you look into
[55:58] it in the hebrew it means
[55:59] a strength it means a fortified place
[56:04] it means a defense so the joy of the
[56:07] lord is your defense
[56:09] the joy the lord is your stronghold the
[56:12] joy of the lord is your fortress or your
[56:14] rocks it's more than just a happiness oh
[56:15] i'm happy he's there for i'm strong no
[56:17] no
[56:18] the joy of the lord is your defense
[56:20] right so
[56:21] the joy of the lord that comes into your
[56:23] soul i'm not talking about a temporal
[56:25] joy one day you're happy next day you're
[56:26] sad i'm not talking about a human joy
[56:28] i'm talking about the joy of the lord
[56:29] when he comes in when he comes in when
[56:32] you meet him
[56:33] there's a defense in that because the
[56:35] devil comes along and to me it's like
[56:37] the shield of faith
[56:39] that's the revelation that that quenches
[56:40] the fiery darts of the devil
[56:42] i mean when he tries to fire those fiery
[56:44] darts in your mind you'll never overcome
[56:46] you're never going to get the victory
[56:47] the word is not true for you
[56:49] you know god doesn't move that way
[56:50] anymore i defy that kind of idea
[56:52] oh we're in the bright age we don't need
[56:54] the gifts anymore i defy that kind of
[56:56] idea
[56:56] you know god always adds he never takes
[56:59] away
[57:00] hallelujah he added from justification
[57:01] he added sanctification
[57:03] then he added the gifts of the holy
[57:04] ghost and he added himself coming and
[57:06] dwelling in the church
[57:07] i mean that's an addition amen so we are
[57:09] justified by faith are we not
[57:11] we're still sanctified are we not he
[57:13] didn't take that away i mean we still
[57:14] have the gifts do we not amen do we have
[57:16] the holy ghost yes we have
[57:18] so he just adds he doesn't take away so
[57:20] in the bright ages all that god is now
[57:22] poured into the church
[57:23] not just in measure but in fullness and
[57:25] that is our portion in this hour
[57:27] we don't just have a you know we're not
[57:28] here just to sit and just absorb a
[57:30] lecture or some teaching
[57:31] this is not a place for intellectual
[57:33] speech if you want insulin if you want
[57:35] intellectual speech go to a university
[57:37] summer you'll hear it
[57:38] but this is not a place or some formal
[57:40] morgue this is not a place of an
[57:41] intellectual speech
[57:43] this is a place where god comes down and
[57:45] he meets us and we can let off the
[57:46] pressure in his presence
[57:48] we can praise him because why because of
[57:50] revelation we can shout
[57:52] because of revelation we can praise him
[57:53] not because of emotional excitement
[57:55] because oh that person is doing it so
[57:56] i'll do it no
[57:57] it's got to be personal to you
[58:00] hallelujah so the joy of the lord is our
[58:03] defense
[58:05] holy where that gloomy coldness comes
[58:07] around you
[58:09] of of of unbelief and the devil tries to
[58:12] say well you just got to mature you know
[58:14] you know one thing that makes me sick
[58:17] people say
[58:17] just enjoy your zeal because it'll come
[58:19] to an end
[58:21] i hate that kind of talk i think i think
[58:24] just get a whole bunch of gasoline and
[58:25] just pour on the fire
[58:27] you know just keep enjoying your walk
[58:29] it'll get better it'll get greater we'll
[58:30] get more just yo
[58:32] but people seem to think when you're
[58:33] coming on fire then you just call off
[58:34] and sit down
[58:35] no no this is not what this is the
[58:37] apostle paul never called off and sat
[58:39] down
[58:39] he just became a brighter burning flame
[58:42] hallelujah he was in a prison and god
[58:44] poured in you think about
[58:45] yeah what i love about john the
[58:47] revelator he was not in some nice church
[58:50] office when he received the book of
[58:51] revelation he's on the isle of patmos
[58:53] which was a prison colony
[58:55] it wasn't a nice fancy island he didn't
[58:57] he wasn't sitting on a beach in the
[58:58] aegean sea having a good time
[59:00] he was in prison but yet the lord poured
[59:02] into him over a couple of years i think
[59:04] it was i mean the book of revelation
[59:07] he says i was in the spirit on the
[59:08] lord's day there he was in prison he
[59:10] says no now i'm in the spirit of the
[59:12] lord i was transported forward in time
[59:14] i had to see to the very end of all
[59:16] things amen
[59:18] wouldn't have that changed his life
[59:19] highly i saw the lamb step forth
[59:22] what did you see today john i heard you
[59:23] shouted in your cell what was going on
[59:25] oh boy i was weeping but then i started
[59:28] shouting why because i saw the lamb i
[59:30] saw my lamb
[59:31] i leaned on his bosom upon the earth i
[59:33] saw him do many mighty things i saw him
[59:35] i mean when he resurrected but
[59:36] i saw him in heaven he stepped forth to
[59:39] claim us you and i
[59:40] the title thee that adam lost amen and
[59:43] all of heaven and earth and under earth
[59:44] heard me shout glory and blessing be
[59:46] unto the lamb
[59:47] why could he do that because of
[59:49] revelation anchored into his soul
[59:51] hallelujah amen
[59:55] you know paul was so moved by he says i
[59:58] knew a man that went to the third heaven
[1:00:00] he speak of himself but he was so
[1:00:02] gripped by that
[1:00:04] hallelujah it was so real to him
[1:00:07] holy and then we have the prophet on
[1:00:10] this day tell us he went beyond the
[1:00:11] curtain of time
[1:00:12] he says i saw you all there now many
[1:00:15] people thought he was just looking at
[1:00:16] the people in the building and sure some
[1:00:17] of them were there
[1:00:18] i mean but i believe he's looking all
[1:00:19] those who came and met jesus christ
[1:00:22] in this age as you and i so i saw you
[1:00:24] over there we were young
[1:00:25] that was past 90 when he was late when
[1:00:27] she was led to the lord but she was a
[1:00:29] young beautiful woman again
[1:00:30] hallelujah you know and and what is it
[1:00:33] really you think when when the holy
[1:00:35] ghost comes into someone's life
[1:00:37] that's a bit of heaven if i can put it
[1:00:38] that way coming and down
[1:00:42] it's a down payment that you have a
[1:00:44] reservation at the wedding supper feast
[1:00:47] right it's god telling you you actually
[1:00:49] have an invitation
[1:00:50] no one can make can take that invitation
[1:00:53] from you but you actually have it
[1:00:54] it's actually in your possession
[1:00:56] hallelujah and actually you already had
[1:00:58] the
[1:00:58] you know in a way it's like it's like
[1:01:00] the rsvp you're saying because you
[1:01:01] because you're built to have it you know
[1:01:03] god is not wondering you know he doesn't
[1:01:05] just have a whole bunch of invitations
[1:01:06] and throw it out like
[1:01:08] someone's standing on the street trying
[1:01:09] to give out something
[1:01:11] you know he knows who's going to end up
[1:01:12] there and that's why the word came your
[1:01:14] way
[1:01:15] because he knew you'd end up there hey
[1:01:16] we should be happy about this
[1:01:18] i mean he knew you would end up there in
[1:01:20] spite of your humanity and your trouble
[1:01:22] and your struggles and your ups and
[1:01:23] downs and
[1:01:24] you know all those things chemical
[1:01:26] imbalances whatever's going on
[1:01:28] i mean he looked beyond those things
[1:01:30] because those things won't get you to
[1:01:31] heaven remember
[1:01:32] we are not going in a rapture because
[1:01:34] we're in some state of nirvana
[1:01:36] where troubles don't bother us anymore
[1:01:38] and hardship doesn't bother us and and
[1:01:40] there's no trials
[1:01:41] that is not a rapture ready state a
[1:01:43] rapture really status when you repent be
[1:01:45] baptized name the lord jesus christ and
[1:01:47] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:01:48] ghost
[1:01:49] where god brings a birth to you amen he
[1:01:52] comes and dwells new seals you to the
[1:01:53] day of your redemption that traps you're
[1:01:55] ready
[1:01:56] oh but i've just started my walk you
[1:01:58] don't worry about that you just keep
[1:02:00] walking
[1:02:01] you just keep walking amen there would
[1:02:02] have been some babies just before they
[1:02:04] crossed jordan there would have been
[1:02:06] some babies born before they crossed
[1:02:07] jordan
[1:02:08] amen so they just brand new on the walk
[1:02:10] but they they weren't 40 years in the
[1:02:11] wilderness like caleb and joshua but
[1:02:13] they were born in a season they crossed
[1:02:14] out
[1:02:14] into the land hallelujah same thing with
[1:02:18] you and i you know
[1:02:19] i think i said about what daniel's
[1:02:21] dedication he turned up just to leave
[1:02:22] you know
[1:02:23] you know because we're at the end of all
[1:02:24] things you know what i mean but that's
[1:02:26] how i feel
[1:02:26] babies born believing they're a believer
[1:02:28] so why you just turned up to leave
[1:02:31] hallelujah because they might not become
[1:02:32] fully born i mean i mean i mean fully
[1:02:34] grown
[1:02:35] you'll follow me amen so the joy
[1:02:39] of the lord is our fortified place
[1:02:43] it is our hiding place a mighty fortress
[1:02:46] martin luther said is our god hallelujah
[1:02:49] so the joy of the lord is our fortress
[1:02:52] that we can run into when the enemy
[1:02:54] comes against us battles us in our mind
[1:02:56] we have a place to run into
[1:02:58] amen what is that joy you know brother
[1:03:00] makes a statement and maybe i'll just
[1:03:01] read it but he
[1:03:02] he says in that message that day on
[1:03:04] calvary he said what
[1:03:06] did calvary do to you
[1:03:10] not for not just for you you know
[1:03:12] everyone needs a day on calvary
[1:03:14] everyone needs a true down calvary not
[1:03:16] just saying a sinner's prayer
[1:03:17] not just i'd say repenting a little bit
[1:03:20] but everyone needs a day on calvary
[1:03:22] where they go and die at calvary where
[1:03:24] they go up the hill
[1:03:26] hallelujah and they literally die to
[1:03:29] themselves and to everything
[1:03:30] you know what i love about someone who's
[1:03:32] had a dark calvary the devil
[1:03:34] dies there too that thing that once
[1:03:36] afflicted amen stays there nailed to the
[1:03:39] cross
[1:03:39] you can't have a darp in calvary and
[1:03:41] walk on in victory in the devil's still
[1:03:43] on your back
[1:03:44] the things you take there should stay
[1:03:45] there hallelujah
[1:03:48] i believe that i believe there's a real
[1:03:49] deliverance this is not seven steps to
[1:03:51] coping with your problems
[1:03:53] this is a transformation center there's
[1:03:54] not seven steps to living with your
[1:03:56] devil
[1:03:56] i just negotiate with him you'll get
[1:03:58] peace no there is no peace
[1:04:00] for him and we're not here to give him
[1:04:02] peace we're here to give him trouble
[1:04:04] we're here to give him a heart attack
[1:04:05] we're here to stress him out we're here
[1:04:07] to bother him
[1:04:08] hallelujah you know the other devil gets
[1:04:10] bothered
[1:04:12] when he is cast out he gets angry we
[1:04:14] know the devil gets angry
[1:04:16] when he is cast out and out of heaven in
[1:04:18] revelations 12 says he has great wrath
[1:04:20] because he knows he has a short time so
[1:04:23] he has a bad day
[1:04:24] he's going to have a real bad day he's
[1:04:25] having bad days right now but you know
[1:04:27] we actually had a tormentum you know
[1:04:29] i think i've said this before but you
[1:04:30] know we are the devil's devil
[1:04:32] i said that in cape town they kind of
[1:04:34] looked at me like this but you know a
[1:04:36] devil means a tormentor
[1:04:38] right we know what devil means is
[1:04:39] tormentor so we're here to torment the
[1:04:41] devil so we're the devil's devil
[1:04:44] why why we're talking to him because
[1:04:46] we're not willing
[1:04:47] to give him us he can't own us
[1:04:51] he can't you know we never sure it says
[1:04:54] in the book of ephesians that we once
[1:04:56] walked according to the prince of the
[1:04:57] power of the year the spirit of now
[1:04:58] working the disa
[1:04:59] spirit i mean the spirit that now
[1:05:01] worketh in the children of disobedience
[1:05:02] so one time
[1:05:04] we walked and we were under his
[1:05:05] rulership and we could have been
[1:05:07] religious
[1:05:08] doesn't matter religious not religious
[1:05:09] whatever but we were under his influence
[1:05:12] but god rich and mercy came one day
[1:05:15] amen and and and cast the devil out of
[1:05:18] our life that we're no longer
[1:05:19] under the devil's leadership anymore but
[1:05:22] under god's leadership we're under the
[1:05:23] leadership of the word
[1:05:25] so now that makes the devil mad because
[1:05:27] he lost the sinner that he thought he
[1:05:29] had
[1:05:29] and he doesn't and and he's like a bully
[1:05:32] he's not willing to
[1:05:33] just let something go he wants to take
[1:05:35] it back but then that's why he comes
[1:05:37] against you again
[1:05:38] but then because the lord has got a hold
[1:05:40] of you he's enthroned in your heart
[1:05:42] there's nothing in you that wants his
[1:05:44] his shiny stuff hallelujah so that makes
[1:05:47] the devil mad
[1:05:48] because he's a bully so now it torments
[1:05:51] him he says how on earth did these
[1:05:53] people
[1:05:54] that i once made do all kinds of stuff
[1:05:56] and they were my little puppets on my
[1:05:58] strings
[1:05:59] how on earth did they come to a place
[1:06:01] where now they don't want what i have
[1:06:02] and i've tried to give them the best
[1:06:04] look i've been spending six thousand
[1:06:06] years making this civilization this is
[1:06:07] the best i have
[1:06:09] this took a lot of effort to build this
[1:06:11] you know this
[1:06:12] this world kingdom but now they don't
[1:06:14] want it
[1:06:15] that torments him because he doesn't
[1:06:17] have a he doesn't have an answer to the
[1:06:18] problem
[1:06:20] right but we have the answer to the
[1:06:22] devil's question
[1:06:23] brother brown says which is the lord
[1:06:24] jesus christ himself
[1:06:26] hallelujah you know so we torment the
[1:06:29] devil
[1:06:30] we give them sleepless nights this
[1:06:32] should make someone happy you mean that
[1:06:34] you mean i
[1:06:35] you know i bother satan absolutely when
[1:06:37] you get when you get down on your knees
[1:06:39] to pray
[1:06:40] the kingdom of hell shakes so you caused
[1:06:42] a whole bunch of earthquakes to go on
[1:06:44] down and helm
[1:06:45] and all the shock absorbers in the world
[1:06:46] can't stop that shaking
[1:06:48] hallelujah amen
[1:06:52] so the joy of the lord is our strength
[1:06:56] amen now jesus came
[1:07:01] to do a job
[1:07:04] it says here in hebrews chapter 2
[1:07:08] he says but we see jesus who has made a
[1:07:10] little lower than the angels for the
[1:07:11] suffering of death crowned with glory
[1:07:13] and honor
[1:07:14] that he by the grace of god should taste
[1:07:16] death for every man
[1:07:17] for it became him for whom are all
[1:07:20] things and by
[1:07:21] are all things and bringing many sons
[1:07:23] unto glory
[1:07:24] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:07:26] perfect through sufferings
[1:07:28] for both he that sanctifieth upon me and
[1:07:31] they who are sanctified are all of one
[1:07:33] for which cause he's not ashamed to call
[1:07:36] them brethren
[1:07:37] amen so we've been cleansed by the blood
[1:07:38] he caught he's not ashamed to call you
[1:07:40] brethren he's not
[1:07:41] he's not ashamed of you he's proud of
[1:07:43] you
[1:07:44] we are his victory i mean saying i will
[1:07:47] declare thy name until my brethren
[1:07:50] in the midst of the church will i sing
[1:07:51] praise unto thee and again i'll i will
[1:07:54] put my trust in him this is
[1:07:56] this is verse 13 of hebrews 2 and again
[1:07:58] behold i am the children which god hath
[1:08:00] given me
[1:08:01] for as much sin as the children i
[1:08:03] partake as a flesh and blood
[1:08:04] he also himself likewise took part of
[1:08:07] the same
[1:08:08] that through death he might destroy him
[1:08:10] that had the power of death that is the
[1:08:12] devil
[1:08:13] and deliver them who through fear of
[1:08:15] death for all this lifetime
[1:08:17] subject to bondage so this was the
[1:08:19] purpose cheat now
[1:08:20] make this real personal don't just make
[1:08:23] it some vague worldwide thing and yeah
[1:08:25] he took
[1:08:25] you know he destroyed the power of death
[1:08:27] and no no he did that in your life
[1:08:30] he did that personally for you i mean so
[1:08:32] when when you had a reel that down
[1:08:34] calvary now when i speak about that down
[1:08:36] calvary i mean a real birth
[1:08:38] right not just being justified not just
[1:08:41] it's good you've got to start your
[1:08:41] journey but when you really meet god
[1:08:44] that's what i'm talking about that's a
[1:08:45] reel down calvary where your birth and
[1:08:47] he comes and
[1:08:48] he fills you with the holy ghost right
[1:08:50] so now now
[1:08:51] if if god has come down into our lives
[1:08:53] he's actually destroyed the power of
[1:08:56] death
[1:08:56] because real death is separation from
[1:08:58] god eternal separation right that's real
[1:09:00] death not
[1:09:00] i'm not talking about this thing dying
[1:09:02] i'm talking about eternal separation
[1:09:04] from god that's real death
[1:09:06] right so now he came into our lives that
[1:09:08] he might destroy
[1:09:09] the power of death that is the devil so
[1:09:11] he might destroy the power of death in
[1:09:12] you
[1:09:14] hallelujah this is what you know this
[1:09:16] should be a joy to us
[1:09:18] i can't die i can't die hey this thing
[1:09:21] can expire i just move house
[1:09:23] and it's an upgrade too so it's a good
[1:09:25] you know that's why i think the apostle
[1:09:27] paul said yo too
[1:09:28] delivers christ but to die is gain right
[1:09:31] so because he had a whole new body which
[1:09:34] is an upgrade to this body
[1:09:36] can't get sick can't get tired can't get
[1:09:38] weak can't have trouble
[1:09:40] can ever grow old hallelujah
[1:09:43] hallelujah so now and deliver them
[1:09:47] who through the who through fear of
[1:09:49] death for all their lifetime
[1:09:50] subject to bondage so what does he do he
[1:09:53] delivers us from the fear
[1:09:54] of death hallelujah
[1:09:58] who's not afraid to die
[1:10:01] why because we know should should this
[1:10:03] heart stop beating
[1:10:04] that there's someone there to actually
[1:10:06] carry me across the chasm
[1:10:08] there's a lifeboat brother i'm saying
[1:10:10] send out the lifeboat when he says when
[1:10:11] i come to the edge of the
[1:10:13] end of my life's journey i'm going to
[1:10:14] cross river jordan he said i'm going to
[1:10:16] take the helmet off and the sword down
[1:10:18] i'm going to call out for the lifeboat
[1:10:19] of
[1:10:20] of the lord to come and the lifeboat
[1:10:21] will come and carry me across
[1:10:23] hallelujah that's more than poetry that
[1:10:26] should be a reality to you and i
[1:10:28] that i'm not afraid to die death
[1:10:32] brother ron spencer said many years ago
[1:10:34] is just a travel bus that gets us to
[1:10:36] where we want to go
[1:10:38] that should give us a joy isn't that a
[1:10:41] you know shouldn't that be a defense
[1:10:43] because the devil says no no you're
[1:10:44] guilty
[1:10:45] but then the blood says you're not
[1:10:46] guilty you know he says no
[1:10:48] you can't go to heaven because um you
[1:10:51] know you have to be sinless to go to
[1:10:53] heaven and the blood says no i've made
[1:10:54] them sinless
[1:10:55] holy i've actually cleansed them i mean
[1:10:57] they're thoroughly been pushed to their
[1:10:58] sin
[1:10:59] i mean they've been washed thoroughly
[1:11:01] there's no you know it's not behind the
[1:11:02] air that's still dirty you're under a
[1:11:03] little toe
[1:11:04] there's a bit of dirt no no thoroughly
[1:11:05] cleansed hallelujah
[1:11:08] amen that now these so now there's a
[1:11:10] people upon the earth that are not
[1:11:12] afraid to die because everyone who's
[1:11:15] afraid to die
[1:11:16] is actually subject to the bondage of
[1:11:18] the fear of death
[1:11:20] that's why people try to extend their
[1:11:22] lives they try and do all kinds of
[1:11:23] things go on diets whatever
[1:11:25] move different you know climates and so
[1:11:27] on and eat
[1:11:28] certain ways nothing wrong with all
[1:11:30] those things but you know but
[1:11:32] people live in such a fear because
[1:11:33] they're trying to extend their life just
[1:11:35] a little bit more a little bit more a
[1:11:36] little bit more
[1:11:37] but those who are now liberated from the
[1:11:39] fear of death
[1:11:40] we're a liberated people aren't we
[1:11:42] remember it's not what you have done
[1:11:44] it's what he has done that matters so
[1:11:46] don't just have in your mind well i've
[1:11:47] been good enough for long enough and
[1:11:49] done this no
[1:11:50] it's the blood and only the blood right
[1:11:52] it's only the blood of jesus christ
[1:11:53] we're relying in
[1:11:54] the prophet said i'm i would hate to try
[1:11:56] and get to heaven on my preaching
[1:11:58] i tried to i'd hate to try and get to
[1:12:00] heaven on my miracles any supernatural
[1:12:02] down in my life i'd hate to try and get
[1:12:03] to heaven on that
[1:12:04] all i'm relying on to get to heaven is
[1:12:06] the blood of jesus christ
[1:12:09] amen that's how we should be so we have
[1:12:12] been liberated from the fear of death
[1:12:13] amen
[1:12:14] hallelujah now jesus would say in john 5
[1:12:19] because he speaks of joy as well but the
[1:12:22] joy of the lord is not human joy
[1:12:25] it's not your joy there's a human joy
[1:12:28] and there's a joy the lord
[1:12:29] there's two joys right now he would
[1:12:33] begin to speak in john 15 about i am the
[1:12:35] vine and ye are the branches
[1:12:37] he that abideth for me and i on him the
[1:12:39] same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:12:40] for without me you can do nothing so you
[1:12:43] know we know that as the vine
[1:12:45] brother brown says if that vine ever
[1:12:46] puts forth another branch it will write
[1:12:48] a book of acts behind it so now when the
[1:12:50] holy ghost comes
[1:12:52] along and births you into the kingdom
[1:12:54] what's that that's the vine putting
[1:12:55] forth another branch
[1:12:56] hallelujah and the life that's in the
[1:12:58] branch i mean in the vine goes into the
[1:13:00] branch which is you and i and brings
[1:13:02] forth fruit
[1:13:03] so it's not you and i trying to
[1:13:04] manufacture fruit it's actually god
[1:13:06] making the fruit and you and i
[1:13:09] of love joy meekness temperance faith
[1:13:11] and godliness and all those things right
[1:13:14] he says he says if you abide if a man
[1:13:17] abide not in me
[1:13:18] he is cast forth as a branch as withered
[1:13:20] and men
[1:13:21] gather them and cast them into the fire
[1:13:23] and they are burned if you abide in me
[1:13:25] and my words abide in you you shall ask
[1:13:27] what you will and it shall be done unto
[1:13:28] you
[1:13:29] herein is my father glorified that ye
[1:13:31] bear much fruit
[1:13:33] and so so shall ye be my disciples
[1:13:36] as the father has loved me so have i
[1:13:39] loved you
[1:13:40] continue ye in my love if you love if
[1:13:43] you keep my commandments
[1:13:44] you shall abide in my love even as i
[1:13:47] have kept my father's commandments and
[1:13:48] abide in his love
[1:13:50] now notice this these things have i
[1:13:52] spoken unto you
[1:13:54] that my joy might remain in you
[1:13:57] right you're saying i'm the vine you're
[1:13:59] the branch right you're saying now now
[1:14:01] you're abiding
[1:14:03] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:14:05] you now for his words to abide in us
[1:14:07] that is not our mental
[1:14:09] recollection or saving his word into our
[1:14:12] human brain into our human spirit
[1:14:15] right now it's he himself the logos the
[1:14:17] word himself coming and dwelling in your
[1:14:19] soul
[1:14:20] that's the word that's how we abide in
[1:14:22] christ is when he himself comes and
[1:14:24] dwells him
[1:14:24] by the baptism of the holy ghost amen so
[1:14:27] that's how the word abides in you it's
[1:14:29] not by your memory of it it's good to
[1:14:30] remember the scripture
[1:14:32] it's real helpful amen you know it's
[1:14:35] good to remember quotes and scriptures
[1:14:37] it's good to absorb those things and you
[1:14:39] know but but that is not what he's
[1:14:41] saying by if my words abide in you you
[1:14:43] know i think it's the jehovah's witness
[1:14:45] they
[1:14:45] um you know they believe that if they
[1:14:47] forget jehovah they're not saved anymore
[1:14:50] yeah if they get alzheimer's they don't
[1:14:52] have salvation anymore because they
[1:14:53] forget jehovah
[1:14:54] this is not what it means by the word
[1:14:56] abiding in you
[1:14:58] right because your mind can go your
[1:14:59] spirit can go but if your soul is sealed
[1:15:01] and you can't lose that salvation
[1:15:03] rights is not our mental ability to to
[1:15:05] to remember the word
[1:15:07] amen but it's if his word abides in your
[1:15:09] soul
[1:15:10] then ask what you will and it shall be
[1:15:12] done unto you now
[1:15:13] to ask what we will it's really it's
[1:15:15] really if our will has surrendered to
[1:15:17] god then our prayers will not be selfish
[1:15:19] prayers
[1:15:20] our prayers will be according to his
[1:15:22] will you know many people they
[1:15:24] you know you know they become believers
[1:15:25] and it becomes a deed
[1:15:27] of the of the message culture and they
[1:15:30] look and this deed is
[1:15:32] they look at certain things around in
[1:15:34] life and they say am i allowed this or
[1:15:35] am i not allowed this
[1:15:37] and it becomes an un uh unpersonal
[1:15:41] detached walk with god because they're
[1:15:44] looking at a list of do's and don'ts
[1:15:47] and i think can i am i allowed this and
[1:15:49] then and then they look at what other
[1:15:50] people do and they kind of gauge it well
[1:15:52] they do it and they do it's therefore i
[1:15:53] can do it or
[1:15:54] they don't do it so i can't do it or
[1:15:55] what will these people think so i better
[1:15:56] not do it all
[1:15:57] these people think this so i better do
[1:15:59] this and it becomes a list of do's and
[1:16:00] don'ts that is not walking with god
[1:16:03] that's actually just keeping a list of
[1:16:04] human-made things it actually should be
[1:16:06] lord
[1:16:07] is this thing pleasing to you will this
[1:16:10] what i'm about to do see watch speak
[1:16:12] whatever it may be will it bring me
[1:16:14] closer to you
[1:16:15] or will it take me further away from you
[1:16:16] will it grieve your spirit or will
[1:16:18] you welcome you into my presence that's
[1:16:21] how it should be
[1:16:22] right oh am i allowed to do this now
[1:16:24] we're talking to the girls about this
[1:16:25] you know
[1:16:26] are we allowed when am i allowed to
[1:16:28] phone and all these different things you
[1:16:29] know it's not
[1:16:29] no that's a that you know that's by the
[1:16:32] buy but you bring that into walking with
[1:16:34] the lord
[1:16:35] or is this allowed can i you know no it
[1:16:38] should be lord
[1:16:39] is this pleasing to you what what's
[1:16:41] what's not you know now the word opinion
[1:16:43] is the wrong thing to say about the word
[1:16:45] but you know
[1:16:45] what's your opinion how do you feel
[1:16:47] about this what do you what is your mind
[1:16:49] if i put it there what is your mind on
[1:16:50] this thing
[1:16:51] can i watch it again the scripture says
[1:16:53] all things do in the name of lord jesus
[1:16:55] christ
[1:16:57] so we go on youtube we go on tick-tock i
[1:17:00] pray we never go on those things you
[1:17:01] know we go on whatever
[1:17:02] social media places name there can you
[1:17:05] do that in the name of the lord
[1:17:08] can you talk about other people like you
[1:17:10] do in the name of the lord
[1:17:11] can you think about other people how you
[1:17:13] think in the name of the lord
[1:17:15] right oh i hate brother isaac i can't do
[1:17:18] that
[1:17:19] i don't i can say that because he's my
[1:17:20] buddy but you know i can't say that
[1:17:22] or i can't say he's a horrible person
[1:17:24] and say in the name of the lord jesus
[1:17:25] christ i say this
[1:17:27] no because that's not what god thinks
[1:17:28] about brother isaac brother isaacs is
[1:17:31] the son of god
[1:17:32] and that's how god sees him he's
[1:17:33] redeemed washing the blood you know he
[1:17:35] he's going in a rapture i believe and
[1:17:36] that's what that's how god sees him
[1:17:38] so that's how god sees him i should
[1:17:40] speak about him that way
[1:17:42] are you following me amen we can't just
[1:17:45] you know run people down all these
[1:17:46] things no can you do it in the name of
[1:17:48] the lord
[1:17:48] can you watch that you know there's so
[1:17:50] many messages and and
[1:17:52] and different films and music and things
[1:17:54] oh it's such a nice story no
[1:17:55] but what is it what's the underlying
[1:17:57] current of something
[1:17:59] you know we were told we went out and
[1:18:00] saw friends the other night now
[1:18:02] telling us about you know the movie
[1:18:04] frozen two a frozen one it's such a nice
[1:18:06] story
[1:18:07] but in there is as is communing with the
[1:18:09] dead as witchcraft
[1:18:11] all these different things but it's such
[1:18:13] a nice story no but what is the
[1:18:15] underlying thing that's in it
[1:18:17] you know and can i watch what witchcraft
[1:18:19] name lord jesus christ
[1:18:22] well that's a no should be you know i
[1:18:23] hope it's a i don't know it shouldn't be
[1:18:25] a well i'm not your loading no it should
[1:18:27] be a no
[1:18:27] it should be a definite note here oh but
[1:18:30] we can't have any fun
[1:18:32] no no walking with the lord
[1:18:35] is the greatest fun it is the most
[1:18:37] satisfying portion
[1:18:39] it is the best thing to know the lord
[1:18:40] jesus christ i mean to actually have a
[1:18:43] joy
[1:18:44] that cannot be extinguished and to have
[1:18:46] a peace that passes all understanding
[1:18:48] amen we can be looking at the worst
[1:18:50] trial in our lives and shout and praise
[1:18:52] in the storm
[1:18:53] hardly know that our god's got our back
[1:18:55] amen to know that yo you just think
[1:18:57] about i
[1:18:57] i often think what is it like around
[1:18:59] when we see him
[1:19:01] you know it says in the book of
[1:19:02] revelation if i can find it maybe if i
[1:19:05] but it says those who are sealed in
[1:19:06] their forehead
[1:19:08] we'll see them face to face those that
[1:19:10] have the seal of god in their forehead
[1:19:12] will see him face to face
[1:19:15] hallelujah can i be happy for a bit i'm
[1:19:18] going to be happy for it
[1:19:19] that's me that scripture's talking about
[1:19:21] me i've been sealed by the
[1:19:23] spirit of god i mean by the seal of god
[1:19:25] i'm gonna see him face to face
[1:19:27] and i remember when i was quite young in
[1:19:29] my christian walk i thought i'd
[1:19:31] miserably failed in something
[1:19:33] you know the devil twisted around my
[1:19:35] mind where the scripture says that
[1:19:36] there's no
[1:19:37] no more uh blood or no more sacrifice
[1:19:40] for sin if you sin willfully
[1:19:43] so the devil twisted in my mind it's
[1:19:45] basically god says don't do that and you
[1:19:47] do it
[1:19:47] there's no more blood for you any and
[1:19:51] and my heart fell like a lead balloon
[1:19:54] that's how i felt i felt
[1:19:55] i'm done but then i remember the story
[1:19:58] that brother brown told about billy paul
[1:19:59] when he was making his decision when he
[1:20:01] was young is he gonna go
[1:20:02] keep smoking drinking going to the world
[1:20:04] or what and brother braham told him when
[1:20:06] he was standing by i think the garage
[1:20:08] and he put his arms out like this and
[1:20:09] his shadow
[1:20:10] made like a cross on the on the garage
[1:20:13] wall
[1:20:14] he says look billy you're standing here
[1:20:17] you're at a crossroads
[1:20:18] it's either you go with the lord this
[1:20:20] way or you're going to the world you
[1:20:21] have to make your choice
[1:20:23] and we all have to make our choice right
[1:20:25] we've got to make a choice
[1:20:26] and and in that moment when my heart
[1:20:28] fell felt like a lead balloon
[1:20:30] and i felt like i had nothing i said
[1:20:33] lord i might as well put that one arm
[1:20:35] down that would go towards the world i
[1:20:36] have nowhere to go
[1:20:38] and i said least lord i get an
[1:20:40] opportunity to stand before you
[1:20:42] and tell you i love you and you can cast
[1:20:44] me to hell if you want i love you there
[1:20:47] that's how i felt i got nowhere else to
[1:20:50] go
[1:20:50] why there's nothing that that's half out
[1:20:54] and the next morning and i still had a
[1:20:56] heart that was like a lead balloon
[1:20:58] i went to church the next morning
[1:21:00] hallelujah i had a glorious time in the
[1:21:02] presence of god
[1:21:05] why because you know but that gives a
[1:21:07] joy
[1:21:08] that gives a defense because the devil's
[1:21:10] trying to drag you off the road
[1:21:12] come back to me i've got pleasures i've
[1:21:15] got all these awesome things look all
[1:21:16] your friends are doing it it's so cool
[1:21:17] and look at this and you just need to
[1:21:19] fit in and be like this and
[1:21:20] you know but that stuff comes to an end
[1:21:24] and there's no satisfaction to it right
[1:21:26] yes
[1:21:27] you know but if we walk with him
[1:21:31] hallelujah you know
[1:21:34] if we walk with him there's actually a
[1:21:35] satisfaction
[1:21:37] there's a joy and if you have the joy
[1:21:40] the lord is your strength or i say as
[1:21:41] your defense
[1:21:42] say but devil i've burned every bridge
[1:21:46] and i'm not a construction worker i'm
[1:21:47] not going to rebuild those bridges
[1:21:49] and go back into the world i'm not a
[1:21:51] civil engineer i don't want to build
[1:21:52] those things
[1:21:53] i burnt every bridge i'm going on with
[1:21:55] the lord
[1:21:58] well how do you know he'll receive you i
[1:21:59] say if i have this feeling in my heart
[1:22:01] for him
[1:22:03] right now if this is if this is actually
[1:22:05] who i really am
[1:22:06] i believe it is if i have the same
[1:22:08] spirit when i go to the other side
[1:22:10] i believe he'll receive me
[1:22:15] amen amen so
[1:22:18] he's saying that you are the vine no i'm
[1:22:22] the vine near the branches
[1:22:25] so he says if your words if my words
[1:22:27] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[1:22:29] it shall be done unto you as they're
[1:22:30] saying now
[1:22:31] when we ask what we will it's really
[1:22:33] when we surrender
[1:22:34] ourselves that it's not our human
[1:22:37] emotion
[1:22:38] into prayer it's actually we become
[1:22:39] neutral and let him pray
[1:22:42] because many times we've made up our
[1:22:43] mind and then we go pray about it
[1:22:46] oh lord can you do this but in your mind
[1:22:47] you've made up what you want
[1:22:50] but in in in order especially if there's
[1:22:54] a selfish motive behind it right
[1:22:56] but now if you ask what you will now if
[1:22:58] you look at now what is the will of god
[1:22:59] it's his word
[1:23:01] so he's not willing that any should
[1:23:02] perish right
[1:23:04] he is a god of mercy he's a god of
[1:23:06] redemption he's a god of healing he's a
[1:23:08] god of restoration
[1:23:09] he he wished above all that you prosper
[1:23:11] in health
[1:23:13] right so those things are in his will
[1:23:15] those are us as well so we pray
[1:23:17] according to his will
[1:23:18] what do we get then it shall be done
[1:23:20] unto you amen
[1:23:22] how god answers is his prerogative we
[1:23:25] know that
[1:23:25] now herein is my father glorified i'm
[1:23:27] just repeating this again that you bear
[1:23:29] much fruit
[1:23:30] so shall ye be my disciples as the
[1:23:32] father hath loved me
[1:23:34] so i have loved you continue ye in my
[1:23:36] love
[1:23:37] if you keep my commandments you shall
[1:23:39] abide in my love even as i have kept my
[1:23:41] father's commandments and abide in his
[1:23:43] love
[1:23:44] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:23:47] my
[1:23:47] joy might remain in you why is that
[1:23:50] because we're abiding in christ because
[1:23:51] he's in us
[1:23:53] right and that your joy might be full
[1:23:58] so if his joy is in us right because
[1:24:00] he's in us and our joy
[1:24:02] becomes full amen
[1:24:05] and then he says in john 16 and 22 how
[1:24:07] are we going for time
[1:24:08] now john 16 and 22 and ye now therefore
[1:24:11] have sorrow

[1:24:16] shall rejoice
[1:24:18] and your joy no man taketh
[1:24:21] from you hallelujah so he says so
[1:24:24] there'll be sorrow you're gonna have
[1:24:25] sorrow now
[1:24:26] but i'll see you again this is before
[1:24:28] he's just about to go to the crucifixion
[1:24:30] but i'll see you again and your heart
[1:24:32] shall rejoice
[1:24:34] amen we see the holy ghost moving we see
[1:24:37] him come manifest himself
[1:24:39] become a god of realities to us what is
[1:24:41] that that makes our heart rejoice
[1:24:43] i mean you're still with me in this
[1:24:44] pilgrimage lord you're still walking
[1:24:46] with me you're with me and in me to the
[1:24:48] end of the world you know
[1:24:49] you know he promised he'll never leave
[1:24:50] us nor forsake us but it does sure feel
[1:24:52] real good when you feel his presence
[1:24:54] close eh
[1:24:55] it feels real good when you know he's
[1:24:56] there and you feel you feel his
[1:24:58] anointing and
[1:24:59] oh hallelujah amen so your
[1:25:02] your heart shall rejoice and your
[1:25:05] joy no man taketh from you why can't why
[1:25:09] can no man take it from you because no
[1:25:11] man gave it to you
[1:25:13] right if god remember it's actually god
[1:25:15] that gives revelation
[1:25:17] sure he may use an instrument of a tape
[1:25:19] or or the bible or a preacher
[1:25:21] you know and it'd be spoken under
[1:25:22] inspiration or read under inspiration
[1:25:24] but it's god it's god that gives the
[1:25:26] revelation
[1:25:27] right so sure man may water or plant but
[1:25:30] god gives the increase
[1:25:32] god makes it live so that's why that's
[1:25:34] why when it comes to real revelation on
[1:25:36] the word
[1:25:37] no man can take it from you
[1:25:40] and there's a joy that comes with real
[1:25:42] revelation
[1:25:44] hallelujah wasn't it a joy to found out
[1:25:46] there was there was a way of escape for
[1:25:48] you
[1:25:48] it wasn't a joy to find out there was a
[1:25:51] offering for you
[1:25:52] there was blood for you there's room at
[1:25:54] the fountain for you wasn't that a joy
[1:25:56] and there's a joy to actually be into
[1:25:57] the fountain hallelujah and to be washed
[1:26:00] and to be cleansed
[1:26:01] amen there's a joy when god steps on the
[1:26:03] scene and fulfills his word in your life
[1:26:05] doesn't that bring a joy hallelujah
[1:26:09] amen to this joy that i have the world
[1:26:11] didn't give it to me
[1:26:12] the world didn't give it and the world
[1:26:13] can't take it away
[1:26:15] hallelujah he says in that day you shall
[1:26:18] ask me nothing verily verily i say unto
[1:26:21] you
[1:26:21] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[1:26:23] my name he will give it you
[1:26:25] amen now
[1:26:29] brother brahm says this now i'm just
[1:26:30] going to read this a bit lengthy but
[1:26:32] when he preached the sermon this day on
[1:26:34] calvary or that day on calvary
[1:26:36] he said you know this is really an
[1:26:37] easter kind of a message but it's good
[1:26:39] to review these things
[1:26:41] because if you look at that down calvary
[1:26:43] there's the question now what did it do
[1:26:44] for you what did it do
[1:26:46] what did it do too you got to make it
[1:26:47] real personal you know like brother man
[1:26:49] preacher sermon what thinking of christ
[1:26:51] and we watched a um
[1:26:52] cloverdale skit of the prodigal son or
[1:26:54] welcome home it's called
[1:26:56] and there's brother kyle morton as the
[1:26:57] preacher who's being led down to a dump
[1:26:59] and there's a
[1:27:00] boy who ran away from home he's now
[1:27:02] living as a transit on the street
[1:27:04] and and and this preacher goes down to
[1:27:06] the dump and he begins to preach on a
[1:27:08] soapbox and here's this guy and he wants
[1:27:09] to go home and go back to the lord and
[1:27:11] different things but then he asked the
[1:27:13] question he just says why thank you of
[1:27:15] christ
[1:27:16] and that should be the question really
[1:27:18] to us what think ye of christ
[1:27:20] what do you think of him is he just
[1:27:23] something your parents do or some
[1:27:24] annoying thing that you know about
[1:27:26] or some religion or some code of ethics
[1:27:29] or some good man or
[1:27:30] you know a prophet or is it or is he
[1:27:32] lord god almighty
[1:27:33] why think ye of christ you know is he a
[1:27:36] task master
[1:27:37] what think ye or is he the lover of your
[1:27:40] soul your redeemer your friend your
[1:27:41] savior
[1:27:42] what think ye holy and i was thinking
[1:27:44] about it after i was thinking he's the
[1:27:46] greatest one
[1:27:47] because you're going to answer that
[1:27:48] question he's the greatest one there's
[1:27:50] ever been
[1:27:51] greatest one there ever is
[1:27:55] jesus thank the father and i said those
[1:27:57] things says what thinking of that day on
[1:27:59] calvary
[1:28:00] well thank you jesus thanked the father
[1:28:03] that that he hid it from the educated
[1:28:05] and shrewd and wise and prudent and
[1:28:07] would reveal it to babes such as would
[1:28:09] come to calvary
[1:28:10] now watch jesus said watch now he stated
[1:28:12] it the works that i do
[1:28:14] he's doing them right now the works that
[1:28:16] i'm doing now healing the sick raising
[1:28:18] the dead
[1:28:18] opening the eyes of the blind these
[1:28:20] works shall you do also
[1:28:22] you'll do these if you believe in me you
[1:28:24] do these works and then a greater than
[1:28:26] this
[1:28:27] shall you do for i go to my father a
[1:28:29] little while and the world won't see me
[1:28:31] no more
[1:28:32] but you'll see me that's how you know
[1:28:34] you're not in the of the world because
[1:28:35] you see him
[1:28:37] right because the world can't see him
[1:28:41] yet you'll see me i'll be with you even
[1:28:43] in you to the end of the world i will
[1:28:44] not leave you comfortless i'll pray the
[1:28:46] father he'll send you another comforter
[1:28:48] which is the holy ghost whom the world
[1:28:49] cannot receive but you can receive him
[1:28:52] now notice the greater works was to have
[1:28:54] the power in the church not only to heal
[1:28:56] the sick
[1:28:57] by prayer cast out devils by prayer but
[1:28:59] to impart eternal life to believers
[1:29:01] the holy ghost was coming and given into
[1:29:03] the hands of the church to impart life
[1:29:05] oh that's what calvary meant it took
[1:29:08] stooped
[1:29:09] degraded men and women and lifted them
[1:29:11] into a place to be sons and daughters of
[1:29:13] god
[1:29:14] and i put myself in there he took a
[1:29:16] stoop poor wretched
[1:29:18] bingoing hallelujah and lifted him into
[1:29:21] a place to be a son
[1:29:22] of god to heal the sick to impart
[1:29:24] eternal life by giving the holy ghost to
[1:29:26] obedient believers
[1:29:28] men who are once unbelievers to be made
[1:29:30] believers and impart spiritual eternal
[1:29:32] life
[1:29:33] how much greater is it to say this sick
[1:29:35] woman laying here i can pray a prayer of
[1:29:37] faith and she'll be healed that's a
[1:29:39] great thing
[1:29:40] that's what he was doing then but
[1:29:41] greater than this shall you do
[1:29:43] i'm going to give you power not only to
[1:29:45] raise him up for a while
[1:29:47] but to give him eternal life which will
[1:29:49] be eternal forever
[1:29:51] poor blind wretched people how do you
[1:29:53] miss that don't you see that the greater
[1:29:55] thing is
[1:29:55] that's the greatest thing that could
[1:29:57] ever happen was to impart eternal life
[1:29:59] to people
[1:30:00] what is eternal life the life that he
[1:30:01] lived
[1:30:03] the life that was in him impart that to
[1:30:05] others can a man do it a son of god can
[1:30:08] jesus said whosoever sends ye remit to
[1:30:10] them they are remitted
[1:30:12] whosoever sins ye retain to them they
[1:30:14] are retained
[1:30:15] now here is where the catholic church
[1:30:17] and many others make their big mistake
[1:30:18] they go and say i forgive your sins that
[1:30:20] isn't it how did they how did they get
[1:30:24] their sins forgiven in the bible peter
[1:30:26] asked that question on the day of
[1:30:27] pentecost
[1:30:28] they said what can we do to be saved how
[1:30:30] can we get it
[1:30:31] this uh this that you all got he laid
[1:30:34] down the prescription
[1:30:35] he told them what to do he said repent
[1:30:38] every one of you towards god
[1:30:39] and be baptized name the lord jesus
[1:30:41] christ what for the remission of your
[1:30:43] sin
[1:30:44] that's the greater works how many you
[1:30:46] preachers this morning how many of you
[1:30:47] listening to my word on magnetic tape
[1:30:49] and that was me
[1:30:50] are willing to go to calvary this
[1:30:51] morning and look what god did there for
[1:30:54] you
[1:30:55] and forsake your denominational creeds
[1:30:57] and preach the gospel hallelujah it's in
[1:30:58] your lap now
[1:30:59] what are you going to do with it he says
[1:31:01] for repentance or remission of sin must
[1:31:03] be preached in his name
[1:31:05] to all the world beginning at jerusalem
[1:31:07] hallelujah glory there you are
[1:31:08] what does calvary mean to you what did
[1:31:11] that day
[1:31:11] do to you did it stuff you out with some
[1:31:15] theology
[1:31:16] did it make you a stuffed shirt or did
[1:31:18] it make your christian sold out
[1:31:20] hallelujah sins remitted greater works
[1:31:23] than this shall you do
[1:31:24] you see who are the yeas are don't you
[1:31:27] greater works than this remitting sins
[1:31:29] in the name of jesus
[1:31:30] christ but through creeds and
[1:31:31] denominations so forth has bound you
[1:31:33] down to a place till you're still
[1:31:34] serving the world
[1:31:36] tell me any man any woman come can come
[1:31:39] to calvary
[1:31:41] and try to be a big somebody because
[1:31:43] somebody said something tell me where
[1:31:45] you can look in the face of calvary
[1:31:48] in its right light that day in calvary
[1:31:50] how can you have your down calvary and
[1:31:52] come out a stuffed shirt
[1:31:54] what does a stuffed shirt mean a stuffed
[1:31:55] shirt means look at me i know it all
[1:31:58] i know all the mysteries i know all the
[1:31:59] doctrines i know everything listen to me
[1:32:01] that no that's a stuffed shirt
[1:32:04] so how can you ever have a down calvary
[1:32:05] come out a stuffed shirt
[1:32:07] how can you ever come out as a puppet
[1:32:10] for some organization and preach some
[1:32:12] man-made doctrines
[1:32:14] why don't it humble you to the word of
[1:32:16] god if you ever go there you'll come out
[1:32:18] humble
[1:32:19] how can you want to be some big
[1:32:21] something in your organization with a
[1:32:22] feather in your hat
[1:32:24] when this when jesus christ the son of
[1:32:26] god humbled himself
[1:32:28] to be a hacked up body to a spitted face
[1:32:30] until shame and disgrace
[1:32:32] and they stripped his clothes off they
[1:32:33] crucified him before the world despising
[1:32:35] the shame
[1:32:36] how can you go to calvary and come away
[1:32:38] anything different than what he was
[1:32:40] a disgrace and shame oh you say they'll
[1:32:43] kick me out
[1:32:44] let them kick have your day at calvary
[1:32:48] god will have his way with you let me
[1:32:50] quote that again have your day at
[1:32:51] calvary
[1:32:52] god will have his way with you
[1:32:55] amen so if someone's really had their
[1:32:58] down calvary
[1:32:59] how could they come out of stuff shirt
[1:33:01] how can they think they're the greatest
[1:33:02] thing since sliced bread
[1:33:04] you know you know the answer to
[1:33:05] everyone's problems no no if you really
[1:33:07] have a down calvary you'll come out in
[1:33:09] humility
[1:33:11] hallelujah surrender to the word of god
[1:33:15] that's a real humility to submit
[1:33:16] yourself underneath the word of god and
[1:33:18] let him be the king of your life amen
[1:33:24] amen he says now
[1:33:28] now here's where we lose our position
[1:33:30] now this is the same message
[1:33:31] now if you don't watch we try to look
[1:33:33] back at what we was
[1:33:35] says what the devil wants us to look
[1:33:37] back at what we was and as long as we
[1:33:39] look back at what we was
[1:33:40] that sacrifice means nothing to us oh
[1:33:43] can't you see it church
[1:33:44] i would i would not try the job i can't
[1:33:48] and neither can you there's no need of
[1:33:49] trying you're lost to begin with
[1:33:51] as long as you look at what you've done
[1:33:53] but don't look at what you've done
[1:33:55] look at what that down calvary did to
[1:33:58] you it paid your price
[1:33:59] it settled the question your sins be a
[1:34:02] scarlet
[1:34:03] they are white as wool red like crimson
[1:34:06] white like wool
[1:34:07] then you have no sin you're perfectly
[1:34:09] sinless no matter what you've done
[1:34:10] or what you do you're still sinless as
[1:34:12] long as you've accepted jesus christ
[1:34:14] as your savior your sins are forgiven
[1:34:16] anything is forgiven is remitted and
[1:34:18] forgot about
[1:34:19] then what does it do it gives you after
[1:34:21] that condition his spirit
[1:34:23] to follow him and do as he did for
[1:34:25] others who is
[1:34:26] following him i mean i mean others who
[1:34:28] are following on
[1:34:29] he was just one man the perfect man he
[1:34:31] gave his life he made an example for you
[1:34:33] now
[1:34:33] what must we do now the first thing i
[1:34:36] want to say is jesus never lived for
[1:34:38] himself now there's another
[1:34:40] evidence of have you had your day in
[1:34:42] calvary jesus never lived for himself
[1:34:44] he his life was spent for others that's
[1:34:46] perfectly eternal life
[1:34:48] now you say you go to church you do good
[1:34:51] things that's fine
[1:34:52] but when you live your life to yourself
[1:34:54] you have an eternal life eternal life is
[1:34:56] living for others
[1:34:57] it proved it when had come to the lamb
[1:35:00] of god he lived and had eternal life
[1:35:02] because he did not live for himself he
[1:35:04] lived for others and you receive
[1:35:05] eternal life by receiving that day and
[1:35:08] you don't live for yourself no more
[1:35:10] you live for others
[1:35:13] hallelujah he said oh this is hard but
[1:35:16] it's the truth we've got to come to that
[1:35:18] fact recognize what calvary did for you
[1:35:20] he really ever sat down and said what
[1:35:22] did it do for me
[1:35:24] we look at it and say oh yes that's fine
[1:35:27] that isn't it if the son of god had to
[1:35:30] go to kauri for crucifixion
[1:35:32] every man must go to calvary he must
[1:35:35] also have a calvary you must have that
[1:35:38] day of calvary i've got to have that day
[1:35:40] of calvary
[1:35:41] that settles the sin question don't
[1:35:43] shake hands with the preacher
[1:35:45] nor be shook into the church not coming
[1:35:47] by letter or some profession
[1:35:48] but come and buy a birth he never gave a
[1:35:51] letter he never gave a profession he
[1:35:52] gave a birth
[1:35:53] that's how we come and then from that
[1:35:56] automatically
[1:35:57] we're christians living we're living
[1:36:00] christian
[1:36:00] lives hallelujah
[1:36:03] yes what did that what did that down
[1:36:06] calvary
[1:36:08] do for you oh i think i'm just going to
[1:36:10] leave it there i'm going to leave you
[1:36:11] with that question
[1:36:12] because we're going to think about did
[1:36:13] it make you a stuffed shirt did you say
[1:36:15] oh that's
[1:36:16] a nice story that's a nice idea or did
[1:36:19] you really have a down cover yourself
[1:36:20] and die
[1:36:21] and be born again and be transformed
[1:36:25] hallelujah because if you really had
[1:36:26] that down calvary
[1:36:28] then the joy of the lord is your
[1:36:29] strength amen because you know the sin
[1:36:32] question is
[1:36:33] settled hallelujah
[1:36:38] amen
[1:36:43] we have the joy this morning have you
[1:36:46] had that down calvary
[1:36:48] he said this is an awful simple thing to
[1:36:50] speak about no this is vital
[1:36:52] because it's just like pilgrim's
[1:36:54] progress people
[1:36:56] came people came to the end of the way
[1:36:58] and there's one guy who didn't go to
[1:37:00] calvary
[1:37:01] and get his testimony
[1:37:04] i think it is and he tried to get into
[1:37:06] the pearl he tried to get into the city
[1:37:08] but without that testimony that he had
[1:37:09] to go to calvary to get he didn't get in
[1:37:11] the gate
[1:37:13] right and he and and he said the
[1:37:15] christian back on the path he said no no
[1:37:17] all my four bees have gone this way
[1:37:19] this is the way to go but but christian
[1:37:21] said to him but you've got to go by by
[1:37:22] the cross you've got to go this way
[1:37:23] you've got to get a testament
[1:37:24] no no all my four bees have gone this
[1:37:26] way that'll be fine
[1:37:28] and he came to the end and he realized
[1:37:30] he didn't have that testimony
[1:37:32] and he wasn't let in we want to carry
[1:37:35] our testimony
[1:37:37] in here that you've had that down
[1:37:39] calvary
[1:37:40] and it changed your life and then by
[1:37:43] that
[1:37:43] you know the sin question is settled and
[1:37:46] it doesn't matter if this
[1:37:47] building explodes right now and if and
[1:37:49] then we all go into powder
[1:37:52] you know where you're going you know and
[1:37:53] whom you have believed
[1:37:56] amen let's pray this morning then the

[1:39:00] calvary
[1:39:01] lord and i pray dear god that when we

[1:39:07] of me so much what did it do for you
[1:39:10] lord i was lost and undone lord i was so
[1:39:13] undone
[1:39:14] [Music]

[1:39:18] calvary
[1:39:19] lord to die out lord to be identified
[1:39:21] with you the great lamb of god
[1:39:23] lord more than an emotional thing lord
[1:39:26] but lord you
[1:39:27] lord you did a work o god lord that your
[1:39:29] blood lord there's still room at the
[1:39:31] fountain lord where a sinner can be
[1:39:32] plunged beneath that
[1:39:34] lord that flood and lose all their
[1:39:36] guilty stains
[1:39:38] so dear god i just want to pray for each
[1:39:40] one here
[1:39:41] lord if there's anyone here and lord no
[1:39:43] doubt by
[1:39:45] the number of people here there are
[1:39:46] people here who have not had that down
[1:39:48] calvary
[1:39:49] maybe they've gone to an altar maybe
[1:39:50] they've made a profession but lord
[1:39:52] they've never had that day
[1:39:53] where they've really died out they've
[1:39:55] really wrestled it out with you and
[1:39:57] lord laid them whole selves on the altar
[1:39:59] all their affection um all their
[1:40:00] affections hopes and plans and
[1:40:02] all their desires and all that they are
[1:40:04] lord they've rarely died out
[1:40:06] and be born again lord we know it's more
[1:40:09] than just a phrase of a new
[1:40:10] lord saying a new birth or being born
[1:40:12] again it's a real experience lord
[1:40:14] it's a real happening where a sinner
[1:40:17] lays their lives down and when they
[1:40:19] stand up after that experience
[1:40:21] they don't raise up a sinner no more
[1:40:23] they raise up as a new creature
[1:40:25] a new creation in christ jesus so dear
[1:40:28] god i just want to pray father that
[1:40:31] lord that you would give all of us here
[1:40:33] at calvary lord jesus that we would go
[1:40:36] despising the shame and and and the
[1:40:39] ridicule and all those things lord you
[1:40:41] lord you are spit on you're rejected

[1:41:04] may may the joy of the lord be our
[1:41:06] strength
[1:41:08] father when we feel down or gloomy lord
[1:41:10] it's really just the enemy trying to rob
[1:41:12] us of our victory
[1:41:14] trying to get us earthbound and our
[1:41:15] thinking and carnal lord i just want to
[1:41:18] pray
