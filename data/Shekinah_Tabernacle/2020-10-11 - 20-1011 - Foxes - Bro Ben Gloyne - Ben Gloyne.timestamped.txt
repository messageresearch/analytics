[57:08] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[57:09] his word you may have your seats this
[57:11] morning
[57:12] i want to speak about foxes i was
[57:15] walking i was
[57:16] you know i work at esr and we go across
[57:19] there's
[57:20] more wilson's there's a bakery and a
[57:21] sushi place there i i was walking
[57:23] monday at lunch time just just walking
[57:25] to to get lunch and this
[57:27] the little foxes just came on my mind i
[57:29] thought
[57:30] there's something in that you know we've
[57:33] read
[57:33] no doubt we've read this many times you
[57:35] know
[57:37] take us the foxes the little fox that
[57:39] spoil the vines for the vines have
[57:40] tender grapes and
[57:42] you know we sing that song it's
[57:43] manifesting time the fruits are on the
[57:45] vine the lovely one
[57:46] is coming in plain view and you know but
[57:49] to me when
[57:50] when when solomon was inspired to to
[57:52] write these words
[57:54] it was more than just what would appear
[57:56] to be some abstract kind of poet
[57:58] poetry but you know as as brother um
[58:01] said on wednesday we should be able to
[58:04] see god in everything
[58:05] so you know just like the prophet he
[58:08] said that that his first
[58:09] bible was nature he could see god in
[58:11] nature the change of the seasons how the
[58:13] animals behave the
[58:15] vegetation different things so we should
[58:17] be able to see god and nature as well
[58:19] so you know it's very interesting when
[58:21] when solomon was
[58:22] was inspired to write about a a i'll say
[58:26] a being that
[58:27] that could that could spoil a vine
[58:29] notice he did not go to the birds that
[58:30] would eat the grapes he did not go to
[58:32] maybe the bugs that would eat it but
[58:34] he was inspired to point out the foxes
[58:36] now this is this is very significant
[58:39] because the lord
[58:40] is pointing to to something here and um
[58:43] i just want to talk about us today
[58:46] i'm not talking even about salvation
[58:48] today i'm not talking about your soul
[58:49] i'm talking about your spirit and your
[58:50] body
[58:52] talk about foxes talk about there's a
[58:53] there's a battle that the apostle paul
[58:55] would
[58:56] would would would write about and we'll
[58:58] read about it later there's there's a
[59:00] war between
[59:01] the flesh man and the spirit man
[59:04] and and it's amazing because you know we
[59:06] can you know when you first meet the law
[59:08] the law gives you incredible victories
[59:10] you know things that would maybe were
[59:12] massive things they just they just die
[59:14] at your feet you know and then
[59:15] but then there's other things in your
[59:17] life that seem to linger and you wrestle
[59:19] and you wrestle and you
[59:20] overcome and you know and it's it's very
[59:23] interesting how you you know that that
[59:24] that seems to be but sometimes there can
[59:26] be an enemy that you're fighting and
[59:28] you're just something that you're born
[59:29] with or something that you've maybe
[59:31] picked up in life that you weren't
[59:32] looking for but it found you
[59:34] and you know you can be fighting that
[59:35] thing and maybe you can even get
[59:37] discouraged saying why have i not
[59:39] overcome this thing you know it comes
[59:40] around and it goes and it comes and
[59:42] you know it's because this body has not
[59:44] been changed you know that's why
[59:46] we are looking very very forward to a
[59:48] change in the body
[59:49] aren't we are we not amen the longer
[59:51] we're upon the earth this longer lord
[59:53] and it's not because we're aging yeah
[59:55] you know necessarily notes lord i want
[59:56] to get out of this pest house
[59:58] into my real home amen so you know so
[1:00:01] there's things that we just live with
[1:00:03] and we and but we've got to come to
[1:00:04] peace with this thing
[1:00:05] we are in this guy it doesn't mean we
[1:00:08] have lost our victory doesn't mean that
[1:00:10] we're not you know gonna overcome and
[1:00:11] win no no
[1:00:12] we're in this guy but there seems to be
[1:00:15] so it
[1:00:15] can turn into an eternal your internal
[1:00:18] battle
[1:00:19] but i but the lord you gave me great
[1:00:20] victories over these things
[1:00:22] yes why am i having this going on
[1:00:25] and we can lose our our victory in it
[1:00:29] but don't you worry in a moment of a
[1:00:31] twinkling of an eye
[1:00:33] it'll be all gone but while we're going
[1:00:37] along in life
[1:00:37] there's foxes and we're gonna shoot
[1:00:41] those foxes
[1:00:42] right we don't know no good gardener
[1:00:45] just looks out at his garden and say
[1:00:47] well there's these aphids there and
[1:00:48] there's snails and there's slugs and
[1:00:50] well i guess i've got to put up with
[1:00:52] them because they're there oh no no they
[1:00:53] get rid of the things
[1:00:55] and they spray and they and they put
[1:00:57] stuff around and you know
[1:00:58] they kill the enemy amen and our our
[1:01:01] lord jesus
[1:01:02] he is well he is the good husbandman
[1:01:06] he wants fruit he's going to get fruit
[1:01:09] so
[1:01:10] don't misunderstand me this morning
[1:01:12] where i just say well you just got to
[1:01:13] live with this and this is just how you
[1:01:15] are and oh no no no no no
[1:01:17] oh no it's not that way at all okay
[1:01:20] but so it's the foxes that spoil the
[1:01:24] vine now the
[1:01:26] so the the foxes that's the the little
[1:01:29] foxes
[1:01:30] now you would think about you know
[1:01:32] they're in the middle east where you
[1:01:33] know
[1:01:34] uh you're the holy land there were there
[1:01:36] were other enemies there there were
[1:01:37] bears there were lions big predators
[1:01:40] but but solomon pointed out the little
[1:01:42] foxes
[1:01:43] and foxes are not big they're not the
[1:01:45] big things
[1:01:47] little things that hang around but the
[1:01:50] nature of the fox is is
[1:01:52] very i've i've been i've been just
[1:01:53] having a good time in this but it all
[1:01:55] cuts both ways oh boy
[1:01:57] you know anyway so
[1:02:01] um the lord would call israel the vine
[1:02:04] he says this quite a few places in the
[1:02:06] scripture thou has brought
[1:02:08] thou hast brought a vine out of egypt
[1:02:10] thou has cast out the heathen and
[1:02:12] planted it speaking of israel coming out
[1:02:13] of egypt into the promised land
[1:02:15] thou prepared us room before it and let
[1:02:17] us cause it to take deep root
[1:02:19] and it filled the land so he's not
[1:02:21] talking about a natural vine he's
[1:02:22] talking about the people that have been
[1:02:23] planted
[1:02:24] as we have been planted in the you know
[1:02:26] we are the planting of the lord
[1:02:28] amen in hosea 10 and 1 the law israel
[1:02:31] is an empty vine she bringeth forth
[1:02:34] fruit unto himself
[1:02:35] according to the multitude of his fruit
[1:02:37] he hath increased the altars
[1:02:39] according to the goodness of his land
[1:02:41] they have made
[1:02:42] goodly images so they are vine but they
[1:02:44] are fruitless but as i'm just saying
[1:02:46] here that
[1:02:47] you know israel is a vine
[1:02:50] now we know that jesus is the vine and
[1:02:53] we are the branches
[1:02:54] but you can't kill the vine but you can
[1:02:57] stop the fruit coming forth
[1:02:59] on the branches right and we know we are
[1:03:02] the branches right
[1:03:03] amen brother ram said if that vine ever
[1:03:05] puts forth another branch or write a
[1:03:07] book of acts behind it
[1:03:08] and we see a book of acts being written
[1:03:10] hallelujah
[1:03:12] so yet you know yet though we are
[1:03:15] eternal beings going through this period
[1:03:18] of time
[1:03:18] you know we pick up things in our
[1:03:20] spirits that we're either born with
[1:03:23] great trauma or trouble that's passed
[1:03:25] down through generations
[1:03:26] or even things that just happen in our
[1:03:28] lives that you know we weren't looking
[1:03:29] for
[1:03:30] but things just happened to us and it
[1:03:32] can just be a very brief moment in time
[1:03:34] but it can affect our whole life
[1:03:36] after that those are foxes
[1:03:41] paul wood so we're just going to jump
[1:03:42] through these things galatians
[1:03:44] paul would write about this for i say
[1:03:46] then walk in the spirit that ye
[1:03:48] shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:03:50] for the flesh lust us against the spirit
[1:03:52] and the spirit against the flesh and
[1:03:54] these are contrary the one to the other
[1:03:56] so that you cannot do the things that
[1:03:58] you would but if you be led of the
[1:04:01] spirit you are not under the law
[1:04:03] so you're saying that the flesh does
[1:04:04] this it wants to fulfill its own
[1:04:06] you know our body has a mind of its own
[1:04:08] thing is when we're born there's no
[1:04:10] internal struggle
[1:04:11] sure our conscience should tell us we're
[1:04:13] wrong and we need to put things right
[1:04:14] and there should be a call of god in our
[1:04:16] lives
[1:04:16] but there's no battle because there's
[1:04:19] only one nature living
[1:04:20] but then when we're born again by the
[1:04:22] spirit of god another nature comes in
[1:04:24] and that's actually the real lust that's
[1:04:26] coming forth so now there comes to be a
[1:04:28] battle because you know
[1:04:29] we can be pandering to this guy for
[1:04:31] decades and we can get set in our ways
[1:04:34] and we can have our routines but then
[1:04:35] one day god finds us
[1:04:37] and then our whole life has got to be
[1:04:38] basically redone
[1:04:40] but this guy likes to be in charge you
[1:04:43] know we yeah we've been pandering to
[1:04:44] this guy for years
[1:04:46] oh boy there's got to be a real upheaval
[1:04:48] that's got to go on
[1:04:50] hallelujah but this thing this guy will
[1:04:53] be subject to the word of god
[1:04:56] amen you know you may think oh boy i'm
[1:04:58] just a big fox then
[1:05:02] that may be the case but there's one
[1:05:05] present they can get rid of them okay so
[1:05:09] we have the answer amen he'd say in
[1:05:12] romans 7 for i know
[1:05:14] that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth
[1:05:16] no good thing
[1:05:17] for to will is present with me but how
[1:05:19] to perform that which
[1:05:21] is good i find not for the good that i
[1:05:24] would i do not but the evil which i
[1:05:26] would not that i do
[1:05:27] now if i do that which i would not it is
[1:05:29] no more that do it but sin that dwelleth
[1:05:32] in me
[1:05:32] i find in a law that when i would do
[1:05:35] good evil
[1:05:36] is present with me now we are not exempt
[1:05:40] from this
[1:05:41] doesn't matter how long this is the
[1:05:42] prophet messenger for the age he says
[1:05:44] when good's hear evil's present with me
[1:05:47] he knew about this battle real well
[1:05:49] he was chained to a soldier for many
[1:05:51] years
[1:05:52] he had to drag this dead man around
[1:05:55] and when he was chained to the soldier
[1:05:56] he would receive the revelation
[1:05:58] of the epistle to the ephesians he would
[1:06:00] receive great great you know
[1:06:02] inspiration and prayer and god would
[1:06:04] come down that dead
[1:06:06] that that man he was changed who didn't
[1:06:07] hinder him didn't hinder his walk none
[1:06:10] amen amen this guy hey i'm not chained
[1:06:14] to a physical person
[1:06:16] you know someone else you know but this
[1:06:17] guy shouldn't be able to hinder anything
[1:06:19] god wants to do
[1:06:21] we have overcoming power today
[1:06:24] hallelujah for i delight in the law of
[1:06:26] god after the inward man
[1:06:27] but i see another law in my members
[1:06:29] warring against the law of my mind and
[1:06:31] bringing me into captivity
[1:06:33] to the law of sin which is in my members
[1:06:36] o wretched man that i
[1:06:37] am who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:06:39] this death
[1:06:40] i thank god through jesus christ our
[1:06:42] lord so when with the mind i myself
[1:06:45] serve the law of god but with the flesh
[1:06:47] the law of sin there's two laws going on
[1:06:50] one is going to win amen amen and i've
[1:06:53] read the end of the book i know where
[1:06:54] i'm going to end up
[1:06:57] and we'll be on streets of gold and
[1:06:58] we'll be saying hallelujah to the lamb
[1:07:00] and
[1:07:01] glory to god amen now brother braham's
[1:07:04] asked a question
[1:07:06] romans 7 14 to 18 we know that the law
[1:07:10] is spiritual blame carnal soul
[1:07:11] under sin for that which i do not for
[1:07:14] what i would
[1:07:15] i would not but what i hate that i do
[1:07:18] if then i do that which i would not i um
[1:07:21] unto the law consent to the law that it
[1:07:23] is good then
[1:07:25] and now then it is no more i that doeth
[1:07:27] it but sin that dwelleth in me he
[1:07:28] and the question is and he says i cannot
[1:07:30] understand
[1:07:31] well says brother brahms answer he says
[1:07:33] they wrote out the scripture it's paul
[1:07:35] speaking to the romans now he said let
[1:07:37] me
[1:07:37] kind of pull up so you can see he
[1:07:39] says in me as two persons right
[1:07:42] one wants to do see one wants me to do
[1:07:45] wrong the other wants me to do
[1:07:47] and every time i start to do right then
[1:07:50] wrong hinders me
[1:07:52] so there's two natures in a born-again
[1:07:54] christian there's two natures
[1:07:56] the nature we're born with and god's own
[1:07:58] nature
[1:07:59] god's nature wants to manifest the word
[1:08:01] in your life
[1:08:02] the first nature well he just doesn't
[1:08:04] want to do nothing you know
[1:08:05] there's going to come a time where your
[1:08:07] body will thank you you drag him to the
[1:08:09] altar
[1:08:10] right you drag him to be baptized you
[1:08:13] drag him to church you drag him to read
[1:08:15] the bible you drag him to pray you drag
[1:08:17] him to a camp you drag him and then
[1:08:18] eventually you drag him to a body change
[1:08:20] and then he'll thank you right but but
[1:08:23] until then you've got to drag the sky
[1:08:25] around hey he doesn't want to get out of
[1:08:27] bed he doesn't want to pray doesn't want
[1:08:28] to read i'm just i'll just talk about
[1:08:30] myself he doesn't want to listen to the
[1:08:31] message he wants to just relax watch the
[1:08:33] world go by
[1:08:34] but there's something within us that
[1:08:35] should be driving us saying i no
[1:08:37] this is not our final destination this
[1:08:39] is not our portion you're going to a
[1:08:41] body change
[1:08:43] hallelujah but it's foxes now foxes are
[1:08:46] very interesting creatures
[1:08:50] a fox when i talk about foxes i'm
[1:08:54] talking about the spirit we're born with
[1:08:56] our first nature all those kind and then
[1:08:59] we're going to talk about dogs because
[1:09:00] foxes are related to dogs
[1:09:03] now we know the spirit of man really is
[1:09:06] kind of a mysterious thing in terms of
[1:09:09] how trauma and events impact our lives
[1:09:12] we know that there's the you know
[1:09:14] there's the memory
[1:09:14] you know there's the gates into the into
[1:09:17] the spirit there's the reasoning and the
[1:09:18] conscious the memory affection
[1:09:20] imagination
[1:09:21] but the effects of trauma and stress and
[1:09:23] traits that are passed down are not
[1:09:25] really that well understood
[1:09:26] i think if man could really understand
[1:09:29] the impact of events in people's lives
[1:09:32] then i think we would there'd be a lot
[1:09:34] less trouble in the world
[1:09:35] because they try and diagnose mental
[1:09:37] health and give different pills and
[1:09:39] uppers and downers and lifts and
[1:09:41] trying to stabilize someone's spiritual
[1:09:43] you know being but if they could just
[1:09:44] get into the root of the problem
[1:09:47] and get rid of that you know
[1:09:50] problem solved now brother brown would
[1:09:53] say
[1:09:54] quite a few times i don't have the song
[1:09:56] up here but people would come before him
[1:09:58] in prayer lines
[1:09:59] and he would go back into their life and
[1:10:02] pick out events that caused him to be
[1:10:03] the way they were
[1:10:05] and and so he's just one in 1953 says
[1:10:08] all right lady look at here
[1:10:10] if god know what was in your life and
[1:10:12] what has been in your life he surely
[1:10:13] would know yet
[1:10:14] you are healed you've always been a
[1:10:17] little bit nervous
[1:10:18] when you was a little girl one time
[1:10:20] coming from school i see you or
[1:10:21] something
[1:10:22] or either you run up towards a dog or
[1:10:24] something and you got frightened by it
[1:10:26] way back
[1:10:27] had a little checkered plaid dress on
[1:10:29] you remember that it's all over now
[1:10:31] you can go and be made well god bless
[1:10:33] you be healed maybe she forgot about
[1:10:35] that
[1:10:36] maybe she didn't even have the
[1:10:38] understanding of the impact that that
[1:10:40] that little event i remember walking to
[1:10:42] school when i was at primary school me
[1:10:44] and my brother would walk from our house
[1:10:46] to the primary school we went to
[1:10:47] i remember two dogs running out and
[1:10:49] barking at us
[1:10:50] that was just a very brief event was it
[1:10:53] scary it was scary
[1:10:54] i was yay big and they were yeah big you
[1:10:57] know everything's bigger when you're
[1:10:58] little
[1:10:59] but it was just a short event no i don't
[1:11:02] know how much that's impacted my life
[1:11:03] but hey
[1:11:04] those things happen was i looking for
[1:11:06] dogs to bark and run at me no
[1:11:08] was i looking for that kind of trouble
[1:11:09] no but it finds you
[1:11:13] and foxes are an interesting creature
[1:11:14] because they are
[1:11:16] one of the few a few wild animals that
[1:11:19] are called resident
[1:11:20] urban carnivores and that means that
[1:11:22] they would actually be so well adapted
[1:11:24] to human environments that they will
[1:11:26] actually live within
[1:11:27] human environments and we know that adam
[1:11:30] before the fall we could say now i'm
[1:11:32] talking about the
[1:11:33] human man now talking about the first
[1:11:35] nature right
[1:11:36] before the fall he had no foxes right he
[1:11:39] had no foxes in him there were no foxes
[1:11:41] in him there
[1:11:42] perfect love was there you know he was
[1:11:45] walking in perfect faith and all those
[1:11:46] things but then as soon as the fall
[1:11:48] happened
[1:11:49] foxes begin to gather around humanity
[1:11:52] there are wild animals who begin to
[1:11:54] gather and try and begin to feed off
[1:11:56] wherever humans were living and one of
[1:11:58] these was foxes
[1:12:00] they would they would hang around human
[1:12:02] camps we're told they'll begin to eat
[1:12:04] the you know
[1:12:04] whatever the humans would leave over and
[1:12:06] eventually did come a time when the
[1:12:08] foxes would become
[1:12:10] domesticated and this is what we know as
[1:12:12] being dogs today they are related to
[1:12:14] foxes they didn't start off
[1:12:16] as dogs as we know them today but they
[1:12:19] started off as wild animals
[1:12:21] but they came as generations went on you
[1:12:23] know they went from being very wild to
[1:12:25] very tame so the things that adam
[1:12:27] started with maybe a bit of trouble or
[1:12:29] something hurt him in his spirit
[1:12:30] and then he passed it down to us to the
[1:12:33] next generation and something happened
[1:12:34] to them another thing happened it was
[1:12:36] passed down to that generation
[1:12:38] and then eventually because you think
[1:12:39] about it when you first get angry at
[1:12:41] something
[1:12:43] it can be a shock to you you know or
[1:12:46] or you hold a grudge or resentment it
[1:12:47] can be a shock i can't believe i'm
[1:12:49] holding on to this
[1:12:50] i can't believe i'm just mad at this
[1:12:52] person but if you let it go
[1:12:54] on and on and on you get used to feeling
[1:12:56] like that
[1:12:57] you get used to having that response and
[1:12:58] it becomes part of you
[1:13:00] just like a fox you know just say this
[1:13:02] is our little village and you say
[1:13:04] there are some wild dogs out there yes
[1:13:08] and we would be alarmed about them we'd
[1:13:10] maybe have the men with your weapons or
[1:13:12] you know keep the children close or keep
[1:13:13] the you know babies closer
[1:13:15] make sure they don't come into camp but
[1:13:17] eventually
[1:13:18] we would get used to them and they'd
[1:13:20] become part of our village
[1:13:23] just like strife or envy whatever anger
[1:13:25] whatever it may be a lust spirit
[1:13:27] trouble you know insecurity whatever it
[1:13:29] may be eventually that becomes part
[1:13:32] of the family why because as generations
[1:13:36] go on they get you know
[1:13:37] adam imagine adam and eve they were the
[1:13:40] only two
[1:13:41] on the earth that knew what it was like
[1:13:42] to be in the garden
[1:13:44] and they no doubt would try and describe
[1:13:45] it to their children no tell them what
[1:13:47] it was like but they were the only ones
[1:13:49] who were there
[1:13:50] so everyone who was born after them they
[1:13:52] didn't know what it was like to walk in
[1:13:54] that kind of atmosphere
[1:13:55] they didn't know what it was like and
[1:13:57] they began to live a different kind of
[1:13:58] life so they just were getting used to
[1:14:01] fallen human condition
[1:14:04] hey amen foxes
[1:14:08] foxes are omnivores they eat meat
[1:14:11] and vegetation their diet is primarily
[1:14:15] primarily made up of invertebrates
[1:14:18] insects small vertebra
[1:14:19] um vertebrates such as reptiles and
[1:14:21] birds they also eat eggs and vegetation
[1:14:25] they are you know some species of them
[1:14:27] are specialist predators but basically a
[1:14:29] fox will eat anything
[1:14:31] so trouble comes into your life it'll
[1:14:33] latch onto that
[1:14:34] hardship comes sadness comes
[1:14:36] disappointment comes it'll just feed off
[1:14:38] that
[1:14:39] right it'll eat anything basically so
[1:14:40] this is where a wound of a spirit
[1:14:42] there's a fox
[1:14:43] right can come in that will feed on
[1:14:45] anything yeah the devil's no respecter
[1:14:47] of persons he doesn't just i'll leave
[1:14:49] that one oh yes i'll attach myself to
[1:14:51] that one no
[1:14:52] if there's an opening he'll jump in and
[1:14:54] if there's food there a fox we'll eat it
[1:14:57] praise god amen now foxes are primarily
[1:15:01] nocturnal
[1:15:03] so that means they're mainly active at
[1:15:04] night foxes
[1:15:06] can be seen during the day but most of
[1:15:09] their behavior
[1:15:10] is at night so this really shows out you
[1:15:13] know that our fallen human nature you
[1:15:15] know at night most people are asleep
[1:15:17] they don't see you a lot
[1:15:19] right you don't see like you know it's
[1:15:20] normally so our fallen human nature
[1:15:23] really mainly comes out if we're not
[1:15:25] careful when we're alone
[1:15:27] it's very easy to put on my tie put on
[1:15:30] my suit and god bless you brother god
[1:15:31] bless your sister and put on my face
[1:15:33] but at night time i could be i pray i'm
[1:15:35] not but i could be a different person
[1:15:36] why
[1:15:37] because foxes come out at night not
[1:15:40] during the day time only they sometimes
[1:15:41] will
[1:15:42] but it's mainly at night are you all
[1:15:44] following me
[1:15:45] i really pray i've just been having such
[1:15:48] a good time
[1:15:49] and you may think why are you happy
[1:15:51] about fox as well
[1:15:54] david prayed lord cleanse me of my
[1:15:57] secret faults
[1:15:59] and a fault can be very obvious to
[1:16:01] everyone but the person
[1:16:03] that yo i can have a big massive i
[1:16:05] probably have a lot of them
[1:16:07] and maybe everyone's like i don't can't
[1:16:09] believe me
[1:16:10] why does he not see that and i can be
[1:16:12] totally oblivious to it and walk on and
[1:16:15] everything's dandy and oh boy you know
[1:16:18] but that's why david said lord cleanse
[1:16:20] me of my secret
[1:16:21] faults you know and this is why you know
[1:16:24] we've got to really
[1:16:26] take stock see the
[1:16:29] amen so you know they were once
[1:16:32] wild they eventually became domesticated
[1:16:37] let's just read this i was saying this
[1:16:40] taking for myself
[1:16:41] like you was going to say william
[1:16:43] branham well 40 years ago the william
[1:16:44] branham
[1:16:45] it isn't the same one tonight if
[1:16:47] somebody back there would say william
[1:16:49] branham here's a rank rascal
[1:16:50] see because i was born of charles and
[1:16:52] alibranum in their nature i was a sinner
[1:16:55] i come to the world a liar and all the
[1:16:57] habits of the world laid right in me
[1:16:59] but down in there too was another nature
[1:17:01] presence see
[1:17:02] predestinated was in there by god in the
[1:17:05] same body see two natures in there
[1:17:08] well i only catered to one
[1:17:12] oh boy and we cater to it it's a
[1:17:14] full-time job
[1:17:15] it's very demanding amen it wants this
[1:17:18] it gets that it wants this it gets it i
[1:17:20] can't get this well it'll work for it
[1:17:21] that'll get it
[1:17:22] it's a very demanding thing but you've
[1:17:24] got to put it in its place
[1:17:26] amen because of member you say well i
[1:17:28] was born in a broken my my great great
[1:17:31] great great great great grandfather's
[1:17:32] family was broken home broken home
[1:17:34] broken home whatever
[1:17:35] whatever so it's their fault no no what
[1:17:38] do you do with the foxes
[1:17:39] the garden's now yours do you let the
[1:17:42] good husband come in and shoot all the
[1:17:44] foxes
[1:17:44] or do you just look at your mess and say
[1:17:46] well this is not fair for me
[1:17:48] remember we can call them jesus on the
[1:17:51] main line tell him what you want
[1:17:53] hallelujah he's only a call away the fox
[1:17:56] exterminator is only a call away and
[1:17:58] he's not late
[1:18:00] hallelujah no so there was another
[1:18:02] nature in me see two natures in there
[1:18:04] well i only catered to one as it growed
[1:18:07] i good as a baby dadda first thing you
[1:18:09] know i become a liar
[1:18:11] become everything else that's a sinner
[1:18:12] because i raised up that way but down in
[1:18:14] there was a little speck of life
[1:18:16] all the time thank god for that speaker
[1:18:19] life
[1:18:19] i used to remember as a little boy i
[1:18:22] hope i'm not holding you too long but
[1:18:23] knowing
[1:18:24] sitting out here on the creek bank and i
[1:18:26] would sit out there and look around at
[1:18:27] night time
[1:18:28] pop and mom they'd gone out to their
[1:18:30] rest them days they were sinners there
[1:18:32] was no christianity in our home at all
[1:18:34] and oh my my drinking and parties
[1:18:36] carrying on it made
[1:18:37] uh uh it made me sick i'd take my
[1:18:40] lantern and my dogs and go to the woods
[1:18:41] and stay all night in the winter time
[1:18:43] i'd hunt till the party was over maybe
[1:18:45] daylight in the morning come home
[1:18:47] wouldn't be over i'd lay on the top of
[1:18:49] the shed and sleep waiting for the
[1:18:51] daylight to break then i think uh how
[1:18:54] many times so i just read the series a
[1:18:56] bit small
[1:18:57] how then i think of how that times
[1:19:00] then been out there in the summertime
[1:19:02] get my sticks and put them
[1:19:03] down for a little wind break where if it
[1:19:06] rained lay there and have the pole
[1:19:07] sticking out um on the water fishing
[1:19:10] mile dog landing out saying lookie
[1:19:11] here you know last winter i camped
[1:19:14] right here one night i built a fire
[1:19:15] right here when i was waiting for my old
[1:19:17] dog here to tree
[1:19:19] and i had a fire here it was froze five
[1:19:21] inches deep in the ground
[1:19:23] but little flower where'd you come from
[1:19:25] see well and where'd you come from
[1:19:27] who come out of here and planted you and
[1:19:30] what hot house did they bring you out of
[1:19:32] or what about it where'd you come from
[1:19:34] see
[1:19:34] that little flower i'd say well it was
[1:19:36] frozen everything
[1:19:37] and i built a fire on top of it besides
[1:19:39] the freezing element
[1:19:40] here was a heat element laying here on a
[1:19:43] big old log
[1:19:44] where i burned you and yet here you are
[1:19:46] you're alive where'd you come from
[1:19:48] what was it there was another william
[1:19:51] branham see
[1:19:52] a little spot of eternal life down there
[1:19:55] from the genes of god the word of god
[1:19:57] that was placed in there each one of you
[1:19:59] can think of similar
[1:20:00] things see it was working
[1:20:04] will you remember those times where'd
[1:20:06] this come from where did i come from
[1:20:08] what's this all about
[1:20:10] there's another nature china come forth
[1:20:17] this is a domesticated fox
[1:20:20] this is from this website verge.com it's
[1:20:23] a science website
[1:20:25] so here's someone holding this fox
[1:20:29] this was 60 years in the making
[1:20:32] now you think 60 years that could be say
[1:20:34] three generations of
[1:20:35] of of people now foxes live about three
[1:20:38] or five years
[1:20:39] some up to ten years but this is a
[1:20:41] selective breeding process
[1:20:44] at first this would have been a foreign
[1:20:48] you couldn't just go pick up a fox it
[1:20:50] would bite you
[1:20:52] so remember but now generations down
[1:20:56] now this fox is tame you can scratch
[1:20:58] them behind the ears maybe play fetch
[1:21:00] you know train it to do little tricks
[1:21:02] but in this fox is a wild nature
[1:21:05] and it doesn't matter what kind of dog
[1:21:07] you have you can have lupine you can
[1:21:09] have poppy
[1:21:10] you know you can you know in those dogs
[1:21:12] deep deep deep deep down
[1:21:14] there is a wolf nature you may think i
[1:21:17] don't think i could find it but it'll be
[1:21:19] in there
[1:21:20] because it's traits that are still in it
[1:21:22] so
[1:21:24] it's the same thing with you and i
[1:21:28] we can get used to they got so used to
[1:21:31] these foxes
[1:21:32] they became part yeah pets become part
[1:21:34] of the family
[1:21:36] and and if we're not careful temper can
[1:21:38] become part of the family
[1:21:39] strife envy unforgiveness bitterness
[1:21:42] resentment
[1:21:43] lust amen greed whatever it may be you
[1:21:46] know
[1:21:47] all those things just become part of the
[1:21:49] family
[1:21:51] at first oh no they're not part of the
[1:21:53] family but you led in a fox oh boy he
[1:21:55] hangs around
[1:21:56] and then his children we hang around as
[1:21:58] children's children will hang around and
[1:22:00] eventually you pick him up and you
[1:22:02] defend him
[1:22:04] you look after him you feed him you feed
[1:22:07] that ego
[1:22:08] feed that unresentment you know feed
[1:22:10] that bitterness well this person did
[1:22:12] this to me and they did this to me and
[1:22:14] you know basically you're patting your
[1:22:15] fox and scratching him behind the ears
[1:22:17] what you need to do is throw him down
[1:22:18] and shoot him hey man hey man
[1:22:21] but the pro and and the thing is it's
[1:22:23] amazing with animals
[1:22:24] it's amazing with animals the pet
[1:22:27] industry is a very big industry
[1:22:30] multi-billion dollar industry
[1:22:33] i remember i wish i had a photo of it
[1:22:35] but i think you know there was a
[1:22:36] billboard i can't remember where it was
[1:22:37] in
[1:22:38] um wellington and there was
[1:22:42] i think a child needed some money for
[1:22:44] some high-end drug for cancer or some
[1:22:46] very rare form of cancer
[1:22:48] and the billboard said if this was my
[1:22:50] dog i would have had the money already
[1:22:56] nothing wrong with pets you got to be
[1:22:59] careful with what pet you have
[1:23:01] right yep
[1:23:07] so we can hang around we can things can
[1:23:10] be part of our life it can become normal
[1:23:13] i just you know all jesus help us now
[1:23:17] because you know we are in these bodies
[1:23:22] if we do not understand how we're built
[1:23:24] we will end up hating ourselves
[1:23:29] brother bam says in 1961 do i have this
[1:23:31] up here somebody told me oh this is a
[1:23:33] chief i was rejoicing about them paul
[1:23:35] put this up
[1:23:36] somebody told me here one time one time
[1:23:38] was converted received the holy ghost
[1:23:40] said to me how are you doing
[1:23:41] hey getting along says well pretty good
[1:23:42] pretty bad he said well how you mean
[1:23:45] pretty good and pretty bad he said well
[1:23:46] since
[1:23:47] we received me received the holy ghost
[1:23:49] he said there's been two dogs in me one
[1:23:51] of them a black dog whether my white dog
[1:23:53] he said they argue all the time they
[1:23:55] growl and fight at one another they said
[1:23:57] the white dog wants me to do good
[1:23:59] the black dog wants me to do bad did
[1:24:01] they fight they you know
[1:24:02] as i said we'll drag this guy into a but
[1:24:04] i'm gonna drag
[1:24:06] this guy's being dragged to a body
[1:24:07] change
[1:24:09] he may resent it he may resist it and he
[1:24:11] will because it's the two different
[1:24:13] natures fighting
[1:24:14] but this one will hallelujah remember
[1:24:16] the greatest enemy we have is not the
[1:24:18] devil and not the hordes of hell
[1:24:20] it's not it's not satan our biggest
[1:24:22] member he was defeated it down calvary
[1:24:25] amen our lord jesus went down took the
[1:24:27] keys of hell death and the grave of him
[1:24:29] he's
[1:24:29] absolutely stripped of all power but
[1:24:32] he's a bluff right he's a bluff
[1:24:33] buddy so he's not our biggest enemy you
[1:24:35] say well what are we fighting against
[1:24:38] then
[1:24:38] you're fighting against the man in the
[1:24:40] mirror this flesh man that you wake up
[1:24:43] and you you know
[1:24:44] look at him in the mirror he is your
[1:24:46] biggest enemy
[1:24:47] it's not the devil yeah yeah the devil
[1:24:50] must be so happy sometimes we get so mad
[1:24:53] at him and we
[1:24:53] we accuse him of all different kind of
[1:24:55] things and he's just like what what are
[1:24:57] they accusing me of now okay i'll take
[1:24:59] credit for that that's fine
[1:25:02] and the reason he'll do that is because
[1:25:04] he just thinks they don't understand
[1:25:06] it's that human nature
[1:25:08] that i cause to be hybrid with the
[1:25:10] serpent and it gets passed down that
[1:25:11] fallen human nature it's actually that
[1:25:13] guy
[1:25:14] that's their enemy but they're but
[1:25:16] they're so angry at me and says okay
[1:25:18] it's fine i'll be the fall guy
[1:25:19] i don't mind because as long as they
[1:25:22] don't see who's the real enemy
[1:25:24] what's you know it's like you take in
[1:25:26] the political arena what if we
[1:25:27] start i don't know you know some nation
[1:25:31] wants to destroy the world
[1:25:32] and we're blaming some poor guys in
[1:25:34] south america saying they're the
[1:25:35] beginning of me
[1:25:36] you know these guys who want to destroy
[1:25:38] the world they don't mind
[1:25:39] they read the western news these silly
[1:25:42] guys are thinking that south american
[1:25:43] can't no no we're gonna do it
[1:25:45] they wouldn't mind it's not the devil he
[1:25:46] doesn't mind you know if we blame him
[1:25:48] for everything when it's not always him
[1:25:50] we give him too much credit sometimes
[1:25:53] sure sometimes it's him and it's really
[1:25:55] is him but
[1:25:56] sometimes it's really really you
[1:25:59] why foxes fox is spoiling the vine
[1:26:04] oh boy i think we just get a big shotgun
[1:26:05] with the poison what if you want to just
[1:26:07] just let's just get rid of the things
[1:26:09] we have the holy ghost here amen we have
[1:26:13] we have the guy that can eradicate the
[1:26:14] foxes
[1:26:16] you mean this little thing i've been
[1:26:17] fighting with for decades yeah him
[1:26:19] there come a time when he comes into
[1:26:21] subjection there come a time when this
[1:26:23] guy is dealt with
[1:26:24] we don't have this is not a place where
[1:26:25] we live without problems
[1:26:27] this is not a place where we just get
[1:26:29] used to
[1:26:31] him well this is how you feed him this
[1:26:34] is how you look after him and rearrange
[1:26:37] this this person's life is rearranged
[1:26:39] now around this fox
[1:26:41] it can be a very big extent it can be a
[1:26:43] very small extent
[1:26:44] but this fox has part of this person's
[1:26:47] life
[1:26:48] so the temper can just be a little bit
[1:26:49] of time or it can be all the time the
[1:26:51] unforgiveness can be a little bit of
[1:26:52] time all the time
[1:26:54] right hallelujah stubbornness oh boy
[1:26:57] all those kind of traits you say but i'm
[1:27:00] in the bright age i'm the bride oh yeah
[1:27:01] but we're not exempt from this
[1:27:03] that's right last time i checked i was a
[1:27:04] human
[1:27:06] last time some people may not think so
[1:27:09] but i'm pretty sure i'm part of
[1:27:11] the homo sapien race or whatever they
[1:27:13] call you know i'm one of them
[1:27:16] there's seven billion out of us upon the
[1:27:18] planet doesn't matter what color height
[1:27:19] width whatever you know
[1:27:21] dimensions we're human but the
[1:27:23] difference with the bride is there's a
[1:27:24] seed
[1:27:25] of god on the inside right there is a
[1:27:27] redeemable soul on the inside
[1:27:30] i mean when the holy ghost comes into
[1:27:31] that soul then he begins to take over
[1:27:33] that person's life
[1:27:34] but we have to let him take over that's
[1:27:37] right
[1:27:38] amen so in a way it's like a rental no
[1:27:41] pets allowed
[1:27:44] no pets allowed on this guy oh but he's
[1:27:46] so cute look at him
[1:27:47] look at him he's like a corgi isn't he
[1:27:49] cute my friends had corgis
[1:27:51] little round guys and they run around
[1:27:53] their little legs and
[1:27:54] no no no no pets allowed
[1:27:58] amen so there's two natures so i haven't
[1:28:00] finished this quote yet
[1:28:01] the so the black so i said well chief
[1:28:04] which one of them wins the fight
[1:28:06] i said well that depends on which one
[1:28:07] chief feeds the most
[1:28:09] so i think it's a good answer here see
[1:28:11] it just depends on the warring of the
[1:28:12] body that's in you depends
[1:28:14] on which one you cater to because we've
[1:28:16] got to understand you will cater to one
[1:28:18] you will cater to one right which nature
[1:28:21] you cater to the carnal nature after the
[1:28:23] things of the world
[1:28:24] or the spiritual nature after the things
[1:28:26] of god that does it just like brother
[1:28:28] brown would say
[1:28:29] saying thinking man's filter man just
[1:28:31] has it is mine some drink or some woman
[1:28:32] that's all they think about
[1:28:34] that's catering to this guy the carnal
[1:28:37] man
[1:28:37] which one are we kating catering to
[1:28:41] you know we had we say well i don't have
[1:28:43] any foxes in my life
[1:28:45] well you know as i said foxes eventually
[1:28:48] became dogs by selective breeding
[1:28:50] yes right remember there was a male and
[1:28:52] female dog in the ark and out of those
[1:28:54] two we have these big
[1:28:56] ones this big one's this big one's you
[1:28:58] know
[1:28:59] all different colors sizes it's all by
[1:29:02] selective breeding
[1:29:03] now so you say well
[1:29:06] i don't have any any any uh foxes in my
[1:29:10] life well
[1:29:11] you just gotta see what happens when
[1:29:14] certain things happen around you you
[1:29:16] know we can have you can have two people
[1:29:18] and they can have exactly the same
[1:29:19] temperament born on the same day
[1:29:21] same nature even the same kind of
[1:29:24] socio-economic
[1:29:25] you know conditions where they're raised
[1:29:27] in two parents all those things
[1:29:29] but yet and and something can happen in
[1:29:31] front of those two people and they can
[1:29:33] act
[1:29:33] very differently to the same situation
[1:29:36] why because of foxes
[1:29:38] scars in the spirit pain hurts that they
[1:29:40] carry in their body
[1:29:41] one can flare up and be so distraught or
[1:29:43] troubled and the other one doesn't
[1:29:45] affect them at all
[1:29:47] foxes you know we had a labrador growing
[1:29:50] up
[1:29:51] he's a great dog you could throw him
[1:29:54] around you could body slam him you could
[1:29:56] land him you can you know we used to
[1:29:57] we you know we used to push him around
[1:29:59] you know his fat rolls would make him
[1:30:00] move a certain yeah you just push him
[1:30:02] around and
[1:30:03] you know it wouldn't bother him he was
[1:30:05] he was just placid as placid could be
[1:30:07] but then when the neighbors came along
[1:30:09] with someone that he didn't know to the
[1:30:11] to the gate he would bark and he would
[1:30:13] jump and he would you know
[1:30:15] and and it never bothered us but it
[1:30:18] bothered those around see see many
[1:30:20] things in our lives
[1:30:21] it doesn't bother me when i go off the
[1:30:24] handle it doesn't bother me
[1:30:26] and it's just like our dog he never did
[1:30:28] that to me we pushed
[1:30:29] honestly we pushed him around you know
[1:30:32] laid on him
[1:30:33] used him as a pillow he he just took it
[1:30:35] all
[1:30:36] not one nip hallelujah
[1:30:41] amen so hey this temper never bothered
[1:30:43] me i've got righteous indignation
[1:30:47] this person gotta they've got to repent
[1:30:49] and they've got to ask forgiveness and
[1:30:50] i'm not gonna do that
[1:30:52] hold on that's that's that's that's the
[1:30:56] dog barking
[1:30:59] you know it's never been a problem
[1:31:02] you know some people seem to think some
[1:31:05] people seem to think they can only you
[1:31:07] know they'll blame everyone else for
[1:31:08] their problems
[1:31:09] when they're by themselves i'm rapture
[1:31:11] ready but when they seem to come in
[1:31:13] contact with certain people and it may
[1:31:15] be their spouse or their children or
[1:31:17] people they know
[1:31:18] or they get so troubled and this happens
[1:31:20] and they just flare up and
[1:31:22] but it's the other person's fault no
[1:31:24] it's not you've got a fox
[1:31:26] you've got dogs on your property that
[1:31:28] need to be shot
[1:31:30] hallelujah amen they'll blame you know
[1:31:33] they will blame their failure of a
[1:31:34] christian life based on their spouse or
[1:31:36] their children
[1:31:37] or on their extended family and all the
[1:31:39] reason is because the dog is jumping
[1:31:42] and barking and making a whole bunch of
[1:31:43] noise ever seen people they just
[1:31:46] you know it's like a buttons push and
[1:31:47] crazy just pops out
[1:31:49] why on earth do they react in that kind
[1:31:51] of way
[1:31:53] i didn't call them a name i'll just call
[1:31:55] them fox
[1:31:58] amen but then as soon as all that's gone
[1:32:01] they're quiet
[1:32:02] hey our labrador quiet peaceful
[1:32:08] you know but when people came around oh
[1:32:10] boy
[1:32:12] you know that's why some people seem to
[1:32:14] think well
[1:32:15] if i was by myself up in the woods
[1:32:17] someplace or you know on an island
[1:32:19] i'll overcome but we have to understand
[1:32:23] we bring ourselves with us we're turning
[1:32:26] a page we're going to go here you take
[1:32:28] yourself
[1:32:29] remember the biggest enemy we have is
[1:32:32] the man or woman in the mirror
[1:32:34] hallelujah but we have the weapon
[1:32:38] amen to defeat that guy
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:42] you know and and people can you know we
[1:32:45] we already had fences around our
[1:32:46] property but you know
[1:32:47] just say if you got a dog and you know
[1:32:50] there's no fences that would just roam
[1:32:52] and
[1:32:52] trouble the neighborhood and come back
[1:32:54] and so no doubt you want to hold on to
[1:32:56] that dogs you'd put fences up you'd
[1:32:58] compensate
[1:32:59] to keep that dog on the property maybe
[1:33:01] well it's trouble when when the postie
[1:33:03] comes or the courier comes so you'll put
[1:33:05] some fences
[1:33:06] up at the back of your property that it
[1:33:07] can't come to the front
[1:33:09] and you know you'll compensate they'll
[1:33:11] compensate their whole life to keep that
[1:33:13] dog on the property
[1:33:15] but it'll get out amen eventually
[1:33:18] there'll be a prison break
[1:33:20] so we can you know try and control
[1:33:22] ourselves and our human
[1:33:24] self will and you know keep it all
[1:33:26] sorted you know all right
[1:33:28] oh but there's there's a dog in the back
[1:33:31] and he says
[1:33:32] are you following me this is not a
[1:33:36] reforming
[1:33:37] this is not well seven steps to good
[1:33:39] behavior that becometh a christian
[1:33:41] no no no this is a transformation but we
[1:33:44] understand that as we as we go from
[1:33:47] glory to glory hey foxes are getting
[1:33:49] killed they're being pushed out
[1:33:50] i mean they've been driven off the
[1:33:52] property things that are you know
[1:33:55] how we're raised is normal to us
[1:33:59] until we get older then we can see a
[1:34:01] contrast right so when you're young you
[1:34:03] think well this is normal
[1:34:05] and you may have had the craziest
[1:34:06] parents that are from the crazy crazy
[1:34:08] crazy line
[1:34:09] your last name might mean crazy but when
[1:34:11] you're young you think that's normal
[1:34:13] and so what happens is the things that
[1:34:16] subconsciously now
[1:34:18] how your race will actually when you get
[1:34:20] old have children that will actually be
[1:34:21] passed on to your children
[1:34:23] so there's been some foxes raised in the
[1:34:25] family you inherit them
[1:34:28] and then you pass them on you know i
[1:34:30] doubt very much that a parent would wake
[1:34:32] up in the morning say how can i scar my
[1:34:34] child today
[1:34:35] i doubt very very much even the most
[1:34:37] twisted broken person
[1:34:39] i don't think they'd wake up and say i'm
[1:34:41] just going to break them again
[1:34:45] unfortunately we all have foxes
[1:34:49] right we all
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:53] we all have things in our spirit that
[1:34:56] come up and trouble us
[1:34:59] which is a fox i remember
[1:35:02] it was actually not that long ago i so i
[1:35:06] had a soccer injury
[1:35:08] where i i i tried to kick with my foot
[1:35:12] and my big toe tried to take the half of
[1:35:14] the field with me when i kicked the ball
[1:35:17] and i did it twice and so the joint with
[1:35:20] my big toe into my foot it all puffed up
[1:35:22] and you know so i was limping along
[1:35:24] but then eventually it became right but
[1:35:27] then not long ago i was carrying our sun
[1:35:29] down the hallway
[1:35:30] and my foot just went my toe just went
[1:35:32] click and every time i'd walk would you
[1:35:34] click
[1:35:35] click click click it was real weird
[1:35:38] i have the same kind of thing with this
[1:35:39] thumb i tried to jump a creek
[1:35:41] in my old days and i didn't jump the
[1:35:43] creek and for some reason
[1:35:44] this will click every so often but so
[1:35:46] what happens is
[1:35:47] so this was a past injury and now it's
[1:35:50] flared up again
[1:35:51] and so what i was doing is i was walking
[1:35:53] in such a way that i'd compensate
[1:35:56] how i was walking and now this knee that
[1:35:59] was never originally injured
[1:36:01] i can't really even bend down and put
[1:36:02] weight on it anymore
[1:36:04] and this has come right again but this
[1:36:07] hasn't come right again
[1:36:09] so i'm so i've compensated naturally
[1:36:12] walking now
[1:36:13] i've compensated naturally walking from
[1:36:16] an injury here
[1:36:17] to and i've compensated now i've just
[1:36:19] injured another part of my life
[1:36:21] and so someone comes and hurts us when
[1:36:23] we're young man or woman whatever it is
[1:36:26] and now we put up a defense and now we
[1:36:28] can't someone comes along who's maybe
[1:36:30] you know totally different person
[1:36:33] decades later
[1:36:34] and they're actually part of your family
[1:36:36] now and you can't trust
[1:36:38] them because you're been compensating
[1:36:40] your walk for so long
[1:36:42] because of a former injury why didn't
[1:36:45] you go to the doctor and get your toe
[1:36:47] fixed i thought it was fine she'll be
[1:36:48] right
[1:36:51] i don't know if he could have i don't
[1:36:52] know if he could have fixed it i don't
[1:36:54] know but
[1:36:54] i didn't go we have a great physician
[1:36:58] right we don't have to compensate our
[1:37:00] walk with god
[1:37:01] right because of trauma that's happened
[1:37:03] in the past
[1:37:06] amen so we don't need to compensate for
[1:37:10] barking dogs
[1:37:13] so maybe something young that happened
[1:37:15] to us but it still affects us
[1:37:21] that that so that took 60 years in the
[1:37:24] making
[1:37:26] i don't know how six thousand odd years
[1:37:28] this has been in the making too
[1:37:30] spiritually so i said children normally
[1:37:34] think how they're raised as normal
[1:37:36] yep they're all thinking deep maybe
[1:37:40] but then when they get older they see a
[1:37:42] contrast maybe
[1:37:46] now just as chief said here
[1:37:51] chief said here there's a black dog
[1:37:53] there's a good and a bad dog
[1:37:55] which one you cater to
[1:37:59] now our body is is an interesting
[1:38:02] thing now this is from remember now keep
[1:38:05] dogs in mind remember we've gone from
[1:38:06] foxes in a while they become
[1:38:08] domesticated now they're
[1:38:09] part of the family now this is from
[1:38:12] dummies.com
[1:38:13] i thought it's interesting now it's very
[1:38:16] important how you treat a dog in a
[1:38:19] family
[1:38:20] because remember it is there's an
[1:38:21] instinct in it it's got a pack mentality
[1:38:24] a wolf pack mentality or wild dog
[1:38:26] mentality it's still in it
[1:38:28] so it's very important how you feed your
[1:38:30] dog or how you treat your dog this is
[1:38:32] this
[1:38:33] this guy okay keep this in mind when i'm
[1:38:35] talking about a natural dog
[1:38:36] now when you eat your meals you must eat
[1:38:39] your meals before you feed your dog
[1:38:43] your dog should not eat before you do
[1:38:45] this is from dummies.com
[1:38:47] in the wild the alpha dog chows down
[1:38:50] first and lesser pack members snivel in
[1:38:53] the background waiting for the leftovers
[1:38:56] eat your own meals before you feed your
[1:38:58] dog if your dog's meals are scheduled
[1:39:02] around your own breakfast and supper
[1:39:04] times be sure that you feed her or him
[1:39:06] after you've eaten why is that because
[1:39:10] if you feed it first
[1:39:12] it will think it's the top dog you
[1:39:14] haven't told it it's the top dog you
[1:39:16] haven't said no you're in charge of this
[1:39:17] pack and
[1:39:18] i place you in the highest place and you
[1:39:20] no no it's just how you treat it
[1:39:23] it thinks it's the best now which one
[1:39:26] are you feeding
[1:39:27] right which one are you catering to see
[1:39:29] see a natural family can cater to a dog
[1:39:32] and it can think it's top dog because
[1:39:33] it's fed first
[1:39:35] another thing they say is do not pet
[1:39:38] your dog
[1:39:39] when he or she nudges you with a nose or
[1:39:41] a paw
[1:39:42] so dog can come along and nudge you or
[1:39:44] pour you it wants a scratch
[1:39:46] don't do that because in dog language
[1:39:50] that pit is ordering you to
[1:39:54] pander to its needs
[1:39:58] all right i mean but we would probably
[1:40:00] do it because we love we love our pet
[1:40:02] hey i don't hate this guy
[1:40:06] amen you know no one in their right mind
[1:40:08] hates their own body
[1:40:12] so we can't feed it we can't feed it
[1:40:15] first
[1:40:16] we can't pander to it just because it
[1:40:17] wants to be pandered too
[1:40:19] but some people literally worship their
[1:40:21] dogs
[1:40:22] they literally worship their pets now
[1:40:24] i'm saying if you ever got a dog you
[1:40:25] enjoy your dog
[1:40:27] right now as i said we had a dog growing
[1:40:29] up here's a
[1:40:30] awesome dog and their lives will revolve
[1:40:33] constantly around their animals until
[1:40:36] they become their comfort zone i'm
[1:40:38] talking about this guy here you've got
[1:40:39] this guy in mind yes
[1:40:40] so their whole life remember the
[1:40:42] scripture says they'll become lovers of
[1:40:43] pleasure more than lovers of god
[1:40:45] so they will love things that pander to
[1:40:47] this guy
[1:40:48] more than worshipping god amen right
[1:40:52] and they will some will actually put
[1:40:54] more time and
[1:40:55] effort and heart into their own dogs
[1:40:57] than they do their own family
[1:41:01] because he's never done me wrong what
[1:41:03] because he's never barked at you he's
[1:41:04] back to this guy
[1:41:06] this guy's never done me wrong yeah but
[1:41:07] he's barked at that guy
[1:41:09] right yes
[1:41:13] see you cater to a natural dog you just
[1:41:15] think about the
[1:41:17] let's just go into a mind of a dog just
[1:41:19] your your a
[1:41:21] four-legged friend you feed him first
[1:41:25] and then you pat him and you scratch him
[1:41:27] when he wants
[1:41:28] and then now he thinks subconsciously
[1:41:31] i'm the top of this pack
[1:41:33] so wherever the husband or the father
[1:41:35] sits he'll sit on that chair
[1:41:38] or he'll go lay in their bed he could
[1:41:40] because he's being told
[1:41:42] you're number one you're in charge and
[1:41:45] then you come along and say get off my
[1:41:47] couch you stupid dog and you get angry
[1:41:49] and get frustrated
[1:41:50] and this poor dog is going but you let
[1:41:52] me sit here
[1:41:54] but you let me be and now you're telling
[1:41:56] no you're telling me i'm stupid and i'm
[1:41:58] dumb and i'm not listening
[1:41:59] who's following me and then but the
[1:42:01] thing is so so
[1:42:02] one gesture you're the top at the next
[1:42:06] minute get out of here you mangy animal
[1:42:08] imagine the the anguish in that dog's
[1:42:12] mind
[1:42:13] but i thought i'm number one why are you
[1:42:14] treating me like this but i'm number one
[1:42:16] you're showing me on number one by what
[1:42:18] you do to me but now you're telling me
[1:42:19] i'm the last and the
[1:42:20] and you know am i the top or am i the
[1:42:22] bottom of the pack tell me someone
[1:42:26] and then now a person comes this way a
[1:42:29] believer
[1:42:30] right they love their flesh they let
[1:42:34] their spirit lead them around
[1:42:35] oh i don't feel to to do this today
[1:42:39] the heart is deceitful above all things
[1:42:43] well i just don't feel like this who
[1:42:44] said we're led by our feelings
[1:42:47] you know the world says just follow your
[1:42:48] heart well where's that lead then
[1:42:52] it's going to lead them to nuclear
[1:42:53] nuclear war that's where it's going to
[1:42:54] lead them
[1:42:56] you know live for the moment i'm living
[1:42:58] for a moment
[1:43:00] a change in a body moment that's the
[1:43:02] moment i'm living for
[1:43:04] you know so a person will because
[1:43:05] remember we've got two natures within us
[1:43:08] we'll cater to one and then we get mad
[1:43:11] at ourselves
[1:43:13] i can't believe i said that i can't
[1:43:15] believe i did that and we get frustrated
[1:43:17] at our own flesh
[1:43:18] are you all following me right we get we
[1:43:20] get angry and frustrated
[1:43:22] why it's just like the dog he's gets fed
[1:43:24] first he gets looked after the best and
[1:43:26] then you tell him get out of here you're
[1:43:27] not in charge
[1:43:29] and he has this emotional roller coaster
[1:43:32] and it's because
[1:43:33] we are treating that dog not where it
[1:43:35] should be
[1:43:37] it's the same thing with our flesh we'll
[1:43:38] get frustrated i can't believe i did
[1:43:40] this i can't believe i said that comes
[1:43:41] if i acted that way
[1:43:42] things he thought that were were dead
[1:43:44] and gone somehow they rise up
[1:43:47] well what nature are we catering to
[1:43:51] what nature are we catering to that's
[1:43:53] why i said you know we'll drag this
[1:43:54] we'll drag this guy to a body change
[1:43:56] eventually
[1:43:58] amen so but we can't get we can't hate
[1:44:00] our own self see people
[1:44:02] actually begin to hate their own selves
[1:44:04] you know you take even and you know and
[1:44:05] these things can can actually affect you
[1:44:07] years down the track you take a young
[1:44:10] person
[1:44:10] you know we are all built to love
[1:44:12] someone biologically right
[1:44:15] man loves a woman woman loves a man it's
[1:44:16] just built within us we can't help that
[1:44:19] right but then the world has perverted
[1:44:20] that to such a degree
[1:44:22] you know that remember i'll say it like
[1:44:25] this
[1:44:25] sex in its right place there's nothing
[1:44:27] wrong with it in marriage
[1:44:29] perfect thing god ordained beautiful
[1:44:31] thing but the devil's perverted it so
[1:44:33] much
[1:44:34] that now what happens is people get so
[1:44:36] they can get so twisted in their minds
[1:44:39] that they can't even actually love
[1:44:41] someone or feel
[1:44:42] a physical attraction to their spouse
[1:44:46] but god never ordained it that way
[1:44:50] so you know they can begin hating their
[1:44:52] bodies
[1:44:54] because they've had a maybe a trauma in
[1:44:56] the past they're trying to compensate
[1:44:57] for it
[1:45:00] oh boy
[1:45:06] we shouldn't remember everything
[1:45:09] just because the devil makes something
[1:45:11] horrible
[1:45:12] he had to pervert something to make it
[1:45:14] that way
[1:45:17] i just put it like this when you're
[1:45:20] growing up you'll be attracted to
[1:45:21] someone until you find your real mate
[1:45:24] and then you just love them amen
[1:45:27] right because we're built that way we
[1:45:29] can't become like a
[1:45:30] statue that has not just a robot
[1:45:33] and eventually you say i do then you can
[1:45:35] activate all those senses
[1:45:36] that's not how it works but yet some
[1:45:39] people will try and live that kind of
[1:45:40] way
[1:45:42] because they get angry at their own
[1:45:44] selves they don't understand how their
[1:45:46] bodies work
[1:45:50] job would say in job 11 and 12 i hope
[1:45:52] that's okay now for
[1:45:54] for vain men would be wise this is job
[1:45:58] 11 and 12.
[1:45:59] for vain men would be wise though man be
[1:46:02] born like a wild asses cult
[1:46:06] so um so job is looking into the nature
[1:46:10] the first nature we're born with
[1:46:12] and he's saying that we are born like a
[1:46:14] wild asses cult that's a donkey cult
[1:46:16] what's a donkey stubborn
[1:46:18] this flesh is stubborn indifferent
[1:46:22] it'll kick you if it can it'll cause all
[1:46:24] kind of trouble
[1:46:25] this is the house you live in i'm
[1:46:26] talking about your house i mean you know
[1:46:28] it can be all that kind of way
[1:46:30] but there is within you a power to
[1:46:33] overcome
[1:46:34] amen holy member there is a power to get
[1:46:36] rid of the foxes
[1:46:39] what kind of foxes are there and
[1:46:41] security is a big one
[1:46:43] how do i fit in the grand scheme of
[1:46:44] things you know you you know insecurity
[1:46:47] maybe you are moved around heaps as a
[1:46:49] child you just want some stability
[1:46:51] and people will virtually build a
[1:46:53] fortress around what they love in their
[1:46:54] hobbies and they say
[1:46:56] all because why a fox of insecurity
[1:46:58] instability's there
[1:47:00] amen unable to trust that's another fox
[1:47:04] because something happened i can't trust
[1:47:05] this guy i can't trust her
[1:47:07] i mean bitterness resentment
[1:47:10] can't feel love to empathy towards
[1:47:12] people because
[1:47:15] no one felt it towards them or because
[1:47:17] they were hurt
[1:47:19] all those kind of things they are foxes
[1:47:24] and we didn't want them we didn't sign
[1:47:26] up for them
[1:47:27] but they found us
[1:47:34] now be not deceived god is not mocked
[1:47:37] for whatsoever man soweth
[1:47:39] that shall he also reap for he that
[1:47:42] soweth to his flesh
[1:47:43] shall of the flesh reap corruption but
[1:47:45] he that soweth to the spirit shall of
[1:47:48] the spirit reap ever
[1:47:49] life everlasting and let us not be
[1:47:51] wearing well doing for in due season we
[1:47:53] shall reap if we fight not
[1:47:55] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[1:47:58] do good unto all men
[1:47:59] especially unto them who are of the
[1:48:01] household of faith
[1:48:04] so we want to reap life everlasting
[1:48:08] he says here don't never let a little
[1:48:11] ism or a little something another a
[1:48:13] little bad feeling ever rise among you
[1:48:16] get it out right away now see that's
[1:48:18] it's the little fox that spoils the
[1:48:20] grapes you know
[1:48:22] so keep it out of the way as soon as the
[1:48:24] fox comes on the perimeter of your life
[1:48:26] hey if you can't hit it just shoot a
[1:48:29] warning shot
[1:48:30] just get that thing out don't even don't
[1:48:31] even name it just kill it
[1:48:33] just just chase it away amy tell the per
[1:48:37] um any little feeling go and tell the
[1:48:40] person
[1:48:40] uh to it say i'm wrong i don't i don't
[1:48:43] feel right towards you or something help
[1:48:45] me pray over it
[1:48:46] that i'll get better because we don't
[1:48:49] want nothing
[1:48:50] but just purely the unadulterated holy
[1:48:52] spirit of god among us that's all we
[1:48:54] want
[1:48:54] then the gifts and things will work
[1:48:56] right and everything will be coming
[1:48:57] right
[1:48:59] amen now this is a wild dog
[1:49:03] who's seen these we saw them in the in
[1:49:06] the kruger

[1:51:24] you know brother brahm had to unwind had
[1:51:25] to relax

[1:51:29] life is to be enjoyed but don't feed
[1:51:31] this guy
[1:51:33] don't pander to him
[1:51:39] why are you going through all these
[1:51:40] things foxes
[1:51:42] spoil the vine we want to see the lord
[1:51:45] live in a greater way
[1:51:48] you know you say well do i need to go
[1:51:49] through my life and make a big checklist
[1:51:51] of everything that's happened to me and
[1:51:52] then you know
[1:51:53] no no no you don't you just got to come
[1:51:55] to the law and say lord
[1:51:56] see the prophet had the gift he'd go
[1:51:58] back in someone's life and say this is
[1:51:59] what happened this is what happened this
[1:52:00] is why this is this
[1:52:01] i don't have that kind of a a gift but
[1:52:03] that holy spirit that did that is still
[1:52:05] here
[1:52:06] to meet every need that is here i mean
[1:52:08] we don't have to box and itemize
[1:52:10] everything you know people can be so
[1:52:12] you know people can be so insecure in
[1:52:14] themselves
[1:52:16] that they can they can be so worried
[1:52:18] about everything that as soon as
[1:52:19] something good is they'll just latch
[1:52:21] onto it and they'll basically just let
[1:52:22] everything else go
[1:52:24] we don't want to be insecure in our
[1:52:26] marriages
[1:52:27] and our friendships whatever it may be
[1:52:29] we don't want to be insecure we don't
[1:52:30] want to be insecure in the lord
[1:52:33] but that can be a fox that we can just
[1:52:35] get so used to looking after
[1:52:38] he's good he looks after me real well no
[1:52:40] no why you feed the fox
[1:52:41] you got to spend time and effort to feed
[1:52:43] this fox
[1:52:45] i think just get rid of the fox yes
[1:52:48] but i don't remember what it's like
[1:52:50] never to have foxes where's a whole new
[1:52:52] world
[1:52:53] a foxless world that you can enjoy
[1:52:57] oh but you know well what do you mean
[1:52:59] what's you know you take a natural
[1:53:00] animal
[1:53:01] you can't just go on holiday
[1:53:05] you've got to have someone look after it
[1:53:07] you've got to have food for it you've
[1:53:08] got to have their vet bills you've got
[1:53:10] yeah there's a lot of things you need to
[1:53:11] look after
[1:53:12] as i say i'm not against having animals
[1:53:15] but your whole life it's got to be
[1:53:16] actually built around
[1:53:18] you know if we had a dog we couldn't
[1:53:19] just drive up to tauranga and just
[1:53:21] here we are in taranga or go visit
[1:53:23] someone we're to look after our dog
[1:53:26] and that's the same thing with foxes in
[1:53:28] our lives we actually
[1:53:30] our lives begin to revolve around those
[1:53:32] things yeah there can be one thing in
[1:53:34] our life that our life can revolve
[1:53:35] around for decades
[1:53:41] but when that dog's gone when that dog's
[1:53:44] gone
[1:53:46] you can do what you want you're at
[1:53:48] liberty
[1:53:49] hallelujah and you can just walk on with
[1:53:52] god
[1:53:54] i'm going to leave that there this
[1:53:55] morning
[1:53:58] someone's going to break the cycle
[1:54:01] someone's going to break the cycle
[1:54:02] i believe i'm looking remember this is a
[1:54:04] generation that will break the cycle
[1:54:06] not just the cycle of death life and
[1:54:09] death
[1:54:09] but there'll be a people upon the earth
[1:54:11] that will break the cycle maybe their
[1:54:13] grandparents were indifferent
[1:54:14] and and and unforgiving there'll come a
[1:54:17] time when that comes to an end
[1:54:18] maybe an adulterous spirit came down
[1:54:20] through the family it'll
[1:54:22] come to an end maybe resentment or
[1:54:24] stubbornness or whatever it may be
[1:54:26] that will come to an end maybe just be
[1:54:27] emotionally detached that will come to
[1:54:29] an end
[1:54:30] oh then i believe i'm looking out of
[1:54:32] people amen
[1:54:34] that we are the cycle breaking
[1:54:36] generation
[1:54:37] i mean because this message that we have
[1:54:39] received breaks the cycle
[1:54:41] it breaks all curses it breaks all pain
[1:54:44] it breaks all worry
[1:54:45] brokenness complexes whatever it may be
[1:54:48] it is here to break the cycle
[1:54:51] hallelujah so the foxes that adam begin
[1:54:53] to live with from the fall
[1:54:54] we're gonna go back before there was
[1:54:56] foxes hallelujah
[1:54:58] and we are gonna live in such a way i
[1:55:00] say even now

[1:55:12] spoiling it are you going to build a
