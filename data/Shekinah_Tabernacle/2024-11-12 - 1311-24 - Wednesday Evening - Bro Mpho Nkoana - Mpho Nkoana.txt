what all scripture is given for let's pray our heavenly father Lord Jesus Christ father we stand in your presence tonight we know you love us so much until you can tell us these words until you can make sure that they are written in the Bible so that we can enjoy so that our manifestation of being like you will come to pass in this end time we are thankful tonight that you kept us until this moment father and we are so thankful that we are in the service tonight I pray father that you bless your people I pray the Lord Lord that you just bless your word also pray father God that you bless their hearts bless their ears Lord Jesus put us in one Accord tonight that father God we can fulfill the scripture father God that when you saw the bright in this end time you saw us Gathering here in in low heart today and I pray my father my God that your word will find spot and a place in our heart tonight I pray father God for me as I stand Here Lord that all my thoughts anything that I could

father my God that tonight you you you make us to go over the mountains that not do not seem to be conquered tonight is our desire we commit the service we commit your weight in your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen we may enjoy the comfort of our our seats and then we will read Romans remember last time we also read Romans so at it seems brother Ben that as long as I'm going to find myself here I'm going to be reading Romans um Romans chapter 8 so I it's just does not want to leave me brother Colin Romans chapter 8 let's read Romans chapter 8 but uh that's why I want to to sort of take our thought tonight that we will talk about H verse 11 8811 it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you so when the spirit of the Lord the same one that Rose him from the dead dwells in you tonight it will also Quicken your mortal body so it is this quickening it is this quickening that I want us to speak about this evening amen and if it's okay with you this evening I want us to talk about just a simple but most powerful thought about this the magnet amen sister I hope that I have emailed you the right document e if you see someone scratching their head but we are talking about the magnet the Great magnet H the version that I had said said uh the the the great moving magnet sister tella I'm I'm hoping I didn't send you the right one but if I sent you that wrong one that's what the Lord wanted so we are talking I want us to speak a little bit about this magnet how many of you know is a magnet you know a magnet eh and as boys we used to play with magnet magnet is something that is very interesting and it's very strange thing because it has got some power it has got some force a magnet has got a force that you can't you you can't you can't see you can't touch you cannot but you can you can see the effect of the of the magnet amen you know have you ever hold a maget held a magnet do you know a magnet so a magnet this great big magnet that I've tried to I used hey technology I used this this thing called AI to create that picture and then h i told it what what to give and then it gave me this picture this is not an original picture from some Factory so AI gave me that and then when the prophet preaches talks about this magnet he says that magnet is Jesus that great big magnet is there and is moving huh and it's moving it's moving so when it moves there's something that happens when that magnet moves that magnet it got because it just got a power so with with a magnet just to simplify it for you a magnet has got a has got a um they say it just got two poles Two Poles the North and the South so my in my mind the Lord put in my heart to think about you know if you can just think of the male and the female huh you'll follow me as we go along because the reason is this you see a magnet if you take two magnets and then this is the North Pole and the North Pole of this side of the magnet and you bring them together they cannot they cannot attract one another they they actually repel each other they can't they can't catch each other because they they of the same opposite forces in other words they they fighting they're not they're not they're not magnetized to each other the poles so it must be the North and the South and then they they'll they they'll catch even before you get the they'll attract one another so so so I it came to me that to think about a male and a female because we to be honest with you we are the female part of God am we are the female part of Jesus right that is why that is why and I know that there's people on video land we pray that the Lord will also bless them H if I invited a friend of mine to check to to to to to worship with us I don't know if he's online but you see that is why you can't find a male lion and a male lion together that is why it's not according to the word of God for a male man and a male man to to to come together or a female and a female no no they can't they are not magnetized to be together there there shouldn't be any magnet any magnet that you can be told any Force any form of whatever love is not from God this was not part of what I wanted to talk about but but the magnet attracts the opposite side the the north attracts the the South and the South attracts the north then they they cat one another it will be hard to separate them because now what does a magnet do when you bring it to when you bring a magnet I wanted to buy a magnet but but this thing is a magnet see this wonderful phone of mine it's got a magnet when I get into my car there's another magnet and when I when I put it there before I even put it it pulls my hand the other magnet it's called it clicks can you see it can't stick to my hand now because my hand is not magnetized to this there is no so a magnet what it does according to is it physics or is chemistry it infuses a force in an object so the force of that magnet is infused into an object until it changes what we call the magnetic fields of that object and they become North and South if it's if if it's if it's north and south that one that object object becomes south and north then it it catches it to a point that that object if it can be so infused with that power of that magnet it can even catch another object can you see what your life can do if you are so much infused with the presence of God if you are so much magnetized you can even magnetize other people to Jesus are we together now let's just get to our seon I haven't got there brother B so I I wrote here that a magnet produces magnetic fields so in order for a magnet to is got that force that that that field that is in a magnet that's where the power lies the power of a magnet so that another object or another magnet can be able to be attracted right and that pulls an object like iron Cobalt towards it all have okay I've already spoken about that we can just move on so I told you about that I've just introduced that without looking there because if you look at that picture you will see that some of the objects are not moving yet and some of them are already on air can you see them they they being pulled by some force and some of them as the magnet moves if the owner of the FM comes and just spread Spread spread it spread it spread the word spread the word correct encourage motivate uplift break the chains spread that pile there cuz some are underneath there and they've got they've got the the atoms it's so interesting if you read about the magnet because they say the the the electrons in the magnet H has got atoms that moves into one direction am I right that moves into One Direction any other thing that cannot be attracted by a magnet the atoms in that object they go have Hazard they go in the wrong different dire that's why the magnet but in the magnet all electrons in each and every atom they move into the same direction so the magnet goes into the magnet put that that INF infusion into an object induces it and it has atoms that goes like that that's why the magnet catches it so some of those objects up they have got the qualities and the ingredients and and and they have been predestinated for the market for the magnet to catch them but they underneath some of them have got did you hear the pastor last weekend I said to him look can I just go there and repeat youron he said yes so I won't repeat it but I'll just say said as said detour like brother Greg said I'll just take a small detour what the pastor said on Sunday one of the things was that what you the comments that you make about your brother and and and and and your attitude towards your brother that thing challenged me so much and the Lord said to me sitting there it the Lord said it doesn't end up there even when you are not talking to anyone when you just alone your thoughts because the prophet taught us that our thoughts not even our words our thoughts speak louder he said tell them tell them that their thoughts speaks louder in heaven than their weights just our thought the moment I sit here and I think about my brother negatively imagine it just making noise and it is upsetting the Lord because the Lord has pre-worn me and you it's so important brothers and sisters it's so important because the battle that we are fighting the battle that we are fighting is so serious and the devil does not want me and you to realize the the the the how how ferocious how how how dangerous and how how evil this battle is he doesn't want people whether believer and it doesn't want no one to realize that this is a serious battle and we want to take it seriously and act according to those principles and tactics of War which is the word of God that is why so important to be magnetized by the word to be pulled so tonight um we just going to talk about because the Rapture as we see here is is taking place the Rapture is not going to just the the day we change our bodies it's just the culmination it's just the it's just the what do we call a novel a novel when you read a book and we say when the story is at the peak what do we call it climax climax the changing of the body is just going to be the climax it's just going to be the the climax and TOS the end of the story we are gone right now my girls the Rapture is taking place right now there must be until brother Isaiah Brooks wrote a book a song is it him who wrote it I the great magnet pulling me I what does it say I know for sure it must be God because I feel the pool huh you feel the pool tonight the problem is that some of those things I must I better go to myON sister vessa some of those things H have been there for a very long time seasons and rains and elements have set on them they are still iring or still they can still be they are still or they've got magnetic fields in them amen but but because there's so much time and you know they are rusted they've got things around them they've got so much some of them actually they're bolded down they're tight tight a magnet tries to pull them no they're baled the owner of the family could come and cut those balls cut some of them there they're trying to to cat the magnet they can't because they aluminium you know aluminium it just go like this the magnet goes goes so you want to catch the magnet when it passes your way you want to open your heart and your ears because you see yeah particularly you young people because there's so much so much that the devil is throwing to Earth even the Elder even the Elder the parents but the young people this is this is my my my thing about the young people the devil is aware that if the Lord carries you are going to be powerful sords powerful destroyers of giants one thing he knows and he knows that you are in the right environment and he can see the light your parents dedicated you they're praying for you you got baptized he can see the chances of this guy changing is is threatening me and he also knows that he don't have experience he knows all those things so he makes sure that he start them from primary school from kindergarten he starts them from it's so pathetic it's so dangerous if you can dig and see what the devil does to the young people from small they want to watch horror movies movies from small small it it just he magneti that remember the devil also got his own magnet he's got his own magnet too so the enemy works so hard so it means us we shouldn't just take for granted and say we are we are believers we are the bride and the Lord has done a finished job of course he did but our daily life should remove all the rest even if I'm not sure that this thing is a demon I don't want to get closer to it even anything any even the appearance of sin the appearance the very appearance when you see a woman naked and the Lord the angel of God respects that the they Applause you you see no no a naked woman pass I know there's plenty of them but the Lord looks here what is your attitude what is your attitude do you commment and entertain that thought I bet that is the rust that's the r that the Lord is trying to shave off from you to magnetize you but you are piling more you're not but I'm just saying don't allow it are we together the the the the the things that the pastor was telling us over the weekend I I can't wait for that series to continue and continue because the the word of God brothers and sisters it seeks to clean us the word of God knows what is Among Us it knows that you may say no no me me me I don't gossip I don't harb any grudges are you sure are you sure that when the minister is preaching here talking about attitude that yours so if you are sure then it's your job now to go and cry before God for that person that the word is talking about that's what I got from that message on Sunday and that's what I found the word challenging me so much that we ought to be on our knees on a daily basis otherwise what what are we busy with because we are objects that are meant to be busy worshiping something if God is an object of worship then we are objects of worshiping what are you worshiping what is magnetizing us on a daily basis children let's make sure that we are magnetized by the great magnet amen I'll read for you a few quotes then we are done it's just three slides four not twoo much brother so where where was I so when this magnet keeps moving keeps moving keeps moving it attracts it attracts everything that can be magnetized it goes with the magnet you know why he taking them to it's taking them to be molded to we molded in a big pot and you know go back to the original state that's where we are going it taking them to be moled in a pot to be just like to be one to be like him let me read for you here from that seron and may the the Lord Jesus reveal himself himself to each one of you here tonight in such a way that you will set your affections towards Jesus Christ and never change your cause but go straight towards him all the time you are in this life's journey all you all the time you are in this life's journey all the time meaning that a a a you know you know this thing called the greatest mind the greatest battle ever fought I always wanted to speak about it but I I just never get to it's so it's so big it's so complicated it's so it's so so so so big this greatest battle that is happening in our minds that sometimes you'll find that if you are not magnetized if you're not making sure that you are magnetized huh you'll find that you you're actually fighting against yourself you helping the devil to destroy you let alone leave your brother alone yourself he's capable to create thoughts in your mind the thoughts that are seeking to destroy you and you are not aware brother Ben mentioned it one time that that you think these are my thoughts and they are not your thoughts to an extent that I said to my children hey let me tell you something a tip let me give I was giving one of my boys a tip I said hey we were just chatting I was not correcting him or anything so they are good boys he was say I said hey you must be oh yes it was kir he was telling me a testimony he was telling me a testimony about he was sitting in the train and then H the Holy Spirit something said to him hey talk to that guy and tell him that he must he must get ready to get off the train if he's getting off the next station cuz this guy is busy with the fold man something told him and he just said ah he's a big boy he knows everything so and then the train stops the next stop people get off the train closes the doors and it goes as soon as the train start to move he jumps hey I missed my train huh but the Son of God was there and the spirit said to him tell that guy warn him can I was trying to show him that hey actually as Christians we need to be able to learn how to listen to the spirit to be sensitive to to know when our Lord talks and when the devil talks that's your duty guys those are the things that if I were you I'll be learning to strive the and asking the Lord to help me to to know the shenanigans of the devil not to be busy on the phone playing games forever games are good but they've got their limitations phones are good but remember they are anointed phones are anointed everything that you see here the devil has got a hand in it why why are they so popular isn't it the Bible says the great is the road of the lost and narrow is the one so young people have got a strong strong strong feeling and passion about you guys because the devil knows those four things that you are not experienced that and he even and breathe a spirit of disrespect and disobedient and just just to each country to each family to each community that no until the government even said no you don't hit the children and then he just makes other demons to go and make a few fathers who are abusive and parents so that the another demon can say you see we must protect the children because of this meanwhile it's both two demons you see it's the same devil it's very tickery so our children should be corrected by the weight amen but it starts with us the parents our knees must be painful they must be worn out our knees must be worn out for our children because you have got the the experience you've got the responsibility you've got a God is going to be asking you there's somewhere in the Bible that says I'm going to punish the children because of the iniquity of the parents you know that one how will a loving father and mother want their child to go to hell or to be punished by God because of them so it means our knes must be worn out and painful praying and crying bringing that atmosphere all the time at home in our life calling them by name every day so that God can magnetize them you children your job is that Lord I went through the water I Believe In You Lord give me that experience I want it Lord so first priority for a young person when you wake up Lord guide me Lead Me Lord as I know my father and my mom are praying for me but Lord this feeling this one this one this influence he he's got so much influence that he's he's pouring to the world to the young people so I don't know why I'm talking about that but I didn't plan so all the time we need to focus on him all our lives let's read the next one then we'll read the last one three what do three stands for what does it signifies by the way P Perfection number three Perfection completion going to complete now next next slide quote number two I've seen now he's narrating what I was trying to tell you about that picture the prophet is's narrating this picture he says I've seen a track coming down through there and uh when it did is is is talking about this this big crane this big magnet on the T and here it come and the great magnet coming down a great magnet and and and and and through there and as the magnet passed down through the line I began to notice those shavings flying up to meet it like that them metal shavings I noticed some of them didn't come up and I noticed several pieces of iron didn't come up and that magnet went on back over into the co Cula and and and and and M M drop dropped all of this stuff down into the capula Kola and it was melted and made over again and I said well why didn't it all rise up I said I see some shavings and that man owner of the factory the prophet was talking about and then he said Rend Brum we make some aluminium PS here he said and those aluminium pieces are not magnetized in that magnet they are not magnetized so we are not aluminum we are still that get that that is magnetized that is supposed to be caught by the magnet and if my my challenge not the challenge but this is my message that I must seek to be magnetized and if I don't feel the affection if I don't feel the attraction the pool I must start to to raise my ears you know if you go in the bush and you just watch carefully you'll see the Impala grazing grazing grazing or a rabbit all of a sudden it just stops and the ears go like this Grace because it's sensing it's sensing that there must be danger somewhere yeah and it's even smelling so we must be able to be so sensitive J isn't it to to to check that hey Lord no no no no no no no no I know I'm a Son of God but I want to be sure why why this problem why do I have this problem why am I experiencing this this this this this no no no is this the way Lord Daddy come let's talk advise me here the danger the this is the danger you young people must must be open enough to find someone here that you've got confidence to talk to don't don't the devil wants people who are in the corner in the darkness that is why even when people get married where are they where my my lovely couple when they get married the Bible says they must not do that unadvised so you must never be feel shy to say to a sister sister come talk to me when you are my age of course someone that you trust you pray about your mom your dad your aunt your sister you've got the pastor's wife their girls talk don't die alone don't struggle alone HH don't allow and do it early do it quicker don't overthink it call Daddy Daddy tell me cuz nowadays we talk things with our children we talk we talk boys must talk to their father heavy stuff and you fathers easy easy easy allow the boys to talk to talk what they think and don't be judgmental but this was not in myON so we must not be judgmental sorry we must allow the boys to talk to a point where they think that now they're free to express themselves and they can open up and they can tell and you can be able to advise and motivate them and encourage them and even tell them that when I was your age me I failed on that one they you dead one time I told my boys they said ah you they were surprised they said you I said yes me so they need to know that even dad went through this and he doesn't want me to go through this thing they must know you that you are this my father no no my father no no no no no no he can preach he can't he can't preach so young people I don't know why I'm focusing the Lord is leading me just to talk about you tonight but I'm talking to all of all of you under 99 under 99 years old amen so we were here where the Prophet said and those pieces are not magnetized to that magnet are we magnetized on a daily basis because the great magnet is busy moving he's busy moving there's going to come a time when he's fully released and he come fully in his physical body to come and take us home when that when that Force come you should have already been started to catch and that catch Starts Now it starts now today don't postpone it allow the devil to be a loser in your life just allow the devil don't support him to be a winner if he's a winner not through you tell him not through me not today brother Isaac isn't it not me not today not now me I want Jesus to win I I may be a failure I may fail but devil I make it very clear I said to my friend hey man I told you about our our church we moved now we moved from Stokes Val we are now in lowart he lives in Newlands he a young man who you know you know how young people are and I said to him I because previously I told him about shakina to stream so he never did busy with football so somehow tonight I said hey there's I'm preaching tonight I happen I'm not I'm not much of a Preacher but oh he laughed when I tell him I say I'm preaching he laughed I didn't ask him why he's laughing I didn't ask him I think he couldn't just imagine me brother KU preaching and I said yeah so I thought that was something I thought that is something that would catch him to come and listen and hear that I'm talking about young people so may God bless my dear H colleague there uh let's move to the next slide and then we we will be finishing but the main thing here is that uh just to finish off that if he said if you noted this man tell him brother if you noted they are bolted down some of those things are bolted we don't want to be bolted down we not disputing that there are bolted things that Bol the devil wants to bolt in our life and even weld them no no there a holy ghost grinder that can grind them and cut them and it's very sharp it can cut them allow the grinder of the Holy Spirit just allow just allow just be open just be open have you ever seen a a a cat you know being or or or a dog just or being nicely stroked just allow yourself to be pruned by the Lord just be pruned just say Lord when my wife cut my hair I just like she just turn my head the way she wants I don't stiffen my head and say don't turn me that way hey honey I turn then she makes it that way and then the machine pinches me oh sorry then she goes she's Pro you see that's how we need to allow the Lord to do in our lives that's right not say no don't cut you no no no no the Lord knows better how to cut your hair how to prepare you to be magnetized I want you to be magnetized because tomorrow tomorrow boys I'm expecting very very very strongly brother Arman said to me he's under great expectation tonight I am under expectation that if the Lord terries which I don't want him to T if he tiries I want to sit there and listen to AB preaching to me am and listen to jono and listen to Mo and Reuben blessing and delivering souls and how they're not just going to wake up one morning and they do that no the time to do that is to start now to lay that Foundation to prepared I want K to be standing here breaking those Devils right that's what we're expecting and not only preaching but being victorious in their individual Liv lives ah to a point where a young man who is not so clear who wants to bring a wrong inspiration until he knows that ah that group if you go with them you can't do those guys I don't want to walk with them because they'll tell you about Jesus amen yeah I don't want to walk but if an unbeliever gets attracted to you and don't want to go there's only two options only two I don't I don't like to do this there's only two two options it's either they are attracted by your life and they inspired and they like something is pulling them something is magnetizing them to come to Jesus or you are actually being magnetized to them so I taught this one sorry not this one my daughter I taught her from small I said never never never never in your life never and she was small she said I said never allow yourself to follow your friends they must follow you you've got a choice I'm telling you now if they if I find you following them so I was planting his seat until one day she was she took it so strong I'm not preaching about my family sorry she took it so strong that she now and she reminded me no no but it was your fault you said they must follow me so I'm trying to practice what you preached me what you taught me they must follow me I must not follow them I said no but that's too strong now my girl don't be too too hard so our young people you need to know that friends must follow Jesus in you you mustn't follow them you must Inspire them you must love them to a point where they follow you and don't allow the world to magnetize you don't allow things around your life don't allow your job your work H your business your thoughts your things H your passions to be the ones that disturbs you be magnetized until we Elders we just make it a church it's not acceptable isn't it that now we we just a church no no no no right now we are supposed to be magnetized magnetize magnetize until we are fully infused that when the Great Lord of Heaven comes physically finally down just we just go within a within a twinkling of an eye we are going to go twinkling of an eye will be gone and we want our children with us last slide and I'm I'm thinking of a great magnet sitting Yonder in the heavens at the right hand of God Almighty and someday God's going to let him come and all those who are magnetized to Holy to his spirit will go up in the air it's not going to be that my family believes the message that we've got a history of the message my family or me I got I I got baptized on the 9th of May 1991 I've been long in the message it's not going to be that kind of a talk God doesn't listen to that those things he that time he's not going to be the Savior kind who's talking to you now you see right now I'm talking kindly maybe I'm rough I don't know but I'm talking kind that time and I'm not threatening you it's not going to be a game of h h no no no because he must stick to his word his eyes will be bo boiling like fire that time he'll be the world people will be wanting to die and they can't die gun will just go through your head not you those who are left behind and death will be no more so we are not that we are want to get magnetized young people you need to know this but you you when you come with all your heart and everything you're not going to come because you are afraid yeah death is going to disappear and no no you're going to say ah Lord you've allowed me to be part of this great homegoing to avoid all those things thank you I love you so much you're not coming because you're fearful of not going into the Rapture you are coming because you are so thankful you are so sold out to him for him to avoid your life going through those things that he could die to give you access not to go through those things this is a big opportunity is the greatest opportunity to all of us I'm telling you now in closing that magnet is going to be released one of these days are you getting magnetized because to be magnetized is to be attracted to his word daily to be attracted is to be sold out to find in your self that I'm not feeling okay today why oh I didn't read my Bible I'm not feeling well I'm not something is not right how many times did I pray today those things should be part of your life as a Christian did you know that I saw a newspaper clip before an article a young Jewish Jewish not Jewish Arab young little Arab boy the age maybe of dman or Danny or Daniel there was war between uh I think it was 2001 Iraq war or no no sorry it was between the Arabs and the Jewish so this boy was picking up a rock man a small boy a rock and the journalist happened to take a picture he was taking that rock he wanted to to to Big he wanted to throw it to the to the Israeli soldiers can you see because that boy he's fully indoctrinated he's fully induced with what they tell him from small from birth the spirit goes and he grow up knowing that I must eliminate an Israel a Jew that's what all the demons are out to do they out to do to eliminate you and you must know that you your job is to go out and eliminate them where in my life where in my don't see your brother doing something wrong and you just condone it that's not love because the Bible says the word of God is for correction is for reprove is for encouragement encourage him you you are very lucky you've got a wonderful Pastor who instead of HE encourage you my brother that's not you see let take the opportunity because not all pastors are like that some pastors if you do hey the deacons out that boy out out I don't want that in this church so you're very blessed to have a pastor who can be your friend and then you do something like that he says brother that's the devil that's not you come that's a blessing man if I if I grew up like that I'm not saying my pastors were bad but I just sometimes wanted to reverse I want sometimes I want to reverse to be like them and have a and him he's my Elder and my pastor sometimes I want I want that is a great make him your friend and also make us the the fathers your friends but I mean it's just an important office that you can use it for your advantage young people you can do that amen get magnetized get attracted to him his glory his relationship with you let's get magnetized by the things let's not get magnetized by the things of the world we not saying you cannot use your phone you cannot do this you cannot do that but uh what percentage of your life those things takes in your life what percentage of your time just be honest and fair with yourself you know yourself just be in the little booth and talk to yourself what percentage of my life time in my life do I allocate to God just be honest you see the moment you are honest just you alone and the Lord just the two of you you the right the right thing comes out and the Lord sees that your sincer it your honesty and the Lord helps you just be honest with who with yourself this is the last slide and how glorious that is that we got a magnetic system in glory so this one when I highlighted that one I was thinking of my brothers the the tech desk can you see what it says it says we have got a glor and my eyes are failing me and how glorious that is that we got a magnetic system in glory our system our system we have we have and every man that has been made Compass to guide through this life will Point towards Jesus Christ that great system will not miss you you will be magnetized the electronics and the magnetic field of that system from Glory will magnetize you amen are you ready to be magnetized are you ready that every day you will seek to be magnetized to be attracted your affections until you dream talking to Jesus until you dream that you are in heaven when I was a little boy I I dreamed that oh we were in the Millennium and we were drinking tea and I told my mom that the tea was so good it had milk I told my mom and I grew up knowing that oh in the Millennium that's what I'm going to get because I I I I was so taught about the homec come the home that is coming and the devil along the way he steals those things he steals that inspiration as you get to the to the age of accountability he takes it he makes you forget and amize you and we don't want that to our children we want to preach the gospel so much so that they must know that if there's anything wrong Among Us among our friend I must cry for my friend huh are we together imagine if you get invited to a wedding what will you do when when you get invited you your name is written on the card and you get invited to a wedding what are you going to do and it's for this person that you love and you like I'm telling you you're going to to buy a new dress and a suit because you're preparing for a wedding and you're going to say hey my friend what do you want and you're going to start talking about that preparing for that wedding if you are a tag guy you're going to start if you're like brother Arman you're going to say Hey you see because you are being invited and then the the the wedding person will tell you then you talk to to that person because you've got an in invitation card you're going to a wedding and your name is there and even when you get by the gate you're going to find that your name written there's no other I'm the only one in New Zealand so you you you will be so brothers and sisters we are invited you you have the invitation card right now you have it with you you don't want to miss that and your chair Brother David S told you that your chair is there next to me f chef H imagine the the quality of that chair the comfort of that chair imagine the the deister on that I don't know how the is going to be man I can only imagine so that invitation they had them in your hand is placed is there written Jonathan no de and no one will take it away from you because it's not not written in this paper it's not written in Flesh and Blood he there for you ready and the Lord with all these preachings and all the sermons and for him even to send a prophet was to come and get you and me to honor our invitation am are you with me my girl to honor the invitation so that you can go and occupy your space today I'm sure my boys think that ah this man is just talking about us I'm also talking to brother Aran not only you boys please let me stop here tonight the idea that I had was this great magnet that is busy magnetizing and moving and one day it will drop and come and take us for good but the process does not starts then the process Starts Now on my daytoday life I I like to be very simple very operational on my daytoday life nobody ever said it's going to be easy but hey you've got a cut you are they're waiting for you he said I'm going to prepare I Believe by now he ready long time prepared it's ready written there arand imagine brother coming in there and and let me tell you lastly lastly let me tell you this sometimes we think about these things and we imagine when we no no the spiritual world is so real so real than this physical it's so real real real it's going to be exactly more than what you see them sitting there like Chantel and Mama Sav there and sister Moodle it's going to be like that and you'll be wearing your white garments it will be so real than this because this dies it's going to be so real ah you remember telling H that we will be wearing like this and that time my friend everything will be behind you so how can you lose that how can you afford to allow the enemy of God someone who disrespected the god of heaven and I want to use you for you to lose you already in invited as a as as as as on the on the table of the wedding how can you allow that we cannot be on certain s Lord even if I fail I cannot allow the enemy to do this I'll save you no other foreign Gods thank you for that song Josh and I will save you I
