[47:07] afflictions do the work of an evangelist
[47:10] make full proof of thy ministry for
[47:15] for I am now ready to be offered in the
[47:18] time of my departure is at hand I fought
[47:20] a good fight I finished my course I have
[47:23] kept the faith henceforth there is laid
[47:26] up for me a crown of righteousness which
[47:28] the Lord the righteous judge shall give
[47:30] me at the last at that sorry at that day
[47:34] and not me only but unto all them also
[47:38] that love his appearing amen let's go to
[47:42] Matthew chapter 21 as well just a bit of
[47:46] a maybe a bit of a context here Matthew
[47:52] 21 we're gonna read verses five down to
[47:54] 11 Matthew 21 I start from verse 4
[48:01] Matthew 21 was all down to 11 and all
[48:05] this was done that it might be fulfilled
[48:09] with just spoken by the Prophet saying
[48:11] tell ye the daughter of Zion behold thy
[48:13] King cometh unto thee meek and sitting
[48:16] upon an ass and a Colt the foal of an
[48:18] ass and the disciples went and did as
[48:20] Jesus commanded them and brought the ass
[48:23] and the Colt and put them and put on
[48:25] them their clothes and they set him
[48:28] thereon and the great multitude spread
[48:30] their garments in the way others cut
[48:32] down branches from the trees and strawed
[48:34] them in the way and the multitudes that
[48:36] went before and that followed cried
[48:39] saying Hosanna to the son of David
[48:41] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[48:43] the Lord hosanna in the highest and when
[48:46] he was coming to Jerusalem all the city
[48:48] was moved saying who is this and the
[48:52] multitude said this is Jesus the prophet
[48:54] of Nazareth of Galilee amen may the Lord
[48:57] bless his word you may have your seats
[48:59] this morning I'd like to if I could
[49:02] title this I'd like to call it all that
[49:04] love his appearing
[49:05] now the word appearing in the scripture
[49:09] it means a manifestation and that is a
[49:13] specifically the advent of Christ a
[49:15] means that means that so so when he's
[49:18] appearing that means his manifestation
[49:20] and speaks of his Advent or a second
[49:22] coming now the believer loves his
[49:26] appearing I mean the belief
[49:28] loves his appearing you know we love it
[49:30] when he comes down and he manifests his
[49:33] word and he comes and lives in his
[49:35] people right so we have to have her I
[49:38] think we should just rejoice this
[49:40] morning because the Apostle Paul he had
[49:43] he had such assurance by the revelation
[49:46] he received that because he had fought a
[49:48] good fight that he had finished his
[49:50] course that he had kept the faith that
[49:52] he had a crown of righteousness laying
[49:54] up for him that the Lord the righteous
[49:56] judge shall give him at that day
[49:58] hallelujah but not only him but also all
[50:02] them that love his appearing amen so so
[50:05] that's a good way that you know you have
[50:07] a crown waiting for you it's because you
[50:09] love his appearing
[50:10] hallelujah I mean I'm glad you know you
[50:14] know there's something in us because
[50:16] it's when God comes and identifies
[50:18] himself with you hallelujah
[50:21] it means the world yeah it's not just us
[50:23] identifying ourselves with him yes where
[50:25] anytime mrs. believer yes for a
[50:27] Christian but it's when he comes
[50:28] supernaturally to you and identifies
[50:31] this as my bride this is my wife this is
[50:34] my woman hallelujah holy I am proud to
[50:37] be identified with this person I am not
[50:40] ashamed Amen to say this is mine I have
[50:43] redeemed this one she belongs to me
[50:45] I have judged her righteous because I
[50:47] took her sin upon me I took her judgment
[50:50] I mean in my court which is the only
[50:52] court that matters in this world and the
[50:54] next
[50:54] I have judged her righteous hallelujah
[50:57] so is something that we just love it
[50:59] when he comes and he identifies himself
[51:00] I mean saying this is my people holy and
[51:04] I think that's why we should be able to
[51:06] say we are not ashamed I mean because he
[51:09] you know isn't a tremendous it's more
[51:11] than just talking about him multitudes
[51:13] talk about him or talk about God or you
[51:16] know but it's when he comes down and
[51:18] when he Supernature who reveals himself
[51:20] to you he's saying you're part of me
[51:22] hallelujah
[51:24] so it's not just us you know it's not
[51:27] just us saying that we believe is it's
[51:29] him coming down and saying you're
[51:30] believers that's the thing that matters
[51:32] now it's amazing when you read him when
[51:34] you know you know we read this piece in
[51:35] Matthew that you know here here was the
[51:39] Lord as as
[51:41] brother Andrew seeded it and it really
[51:43] touched me all of heaven became you know
[51:46] the word became flesh all that God was
[51:48] he poured into Christ and they're very
[51:51] Lord of glory was riding into Zion was
[51:54] riding into Jerusalem all that heaven
[51:56] was was embodied in Jesus Christ all of
[51:59] salvation all of redemption all of
[52:02] healing all the peace hallelujah Shalom
[52:05] bride all the peace all the joy all the
[52:09] glory was had become flesh and that was
[52:12] coming into the city I'm in his city and
[52:16] yet the people seen who is this what's
[52:19] going on here what's all this noise why
[52:22] these people excited why they doing
[52:24] things that don't seem normal to the
[52:26] common day why they doing like this why
[52:28] are they not standing around in robes
[52:30] and maybe being like the scribes and
[52:32] Pharisees and being all pious why they
[52:34] shouting why they made me close down why
[52:37] they cutting branches down why they
[52:39] getting excited because redemption was
[52:41] coming into the city I mean the
[52:43] atonement was coming into the city
[52:45] the real lamb was coming hallelujah and
[52:48] the whole city was moved because God was
[52:51] coming into his city hallelujah now it
[52:55] wasn't just you know and they said who
[52:57] is this I say it was Redemption about to
[53:01] be manifested it was the real it was the
[53:04] real lamb was coming on the sacrificial
[53:06] grounds hallelujah the word it wasn't
[53:10] the prophecy it wasn't just a prophecy
[53:13] floating around that had been released
[53:15] it was become flesh hallelujah and the
[53:18] multitude said this is Jesus the prophet
[53:21] of Galilee of Nazareth now they were
[53:24] close but they didn't quite get it it
[53:26] was God more it was the god prophet I
[53:29] mean it was all the Word made flesh
[53:31] coming into the city he was coming
[53:35] hallelujah
[53:36] but there was some there now this is I'm
[53:38] just going to dramatize this because
[53:39] this is just how I felt you know there
[53:42] was more than just the multitude stood
[53:45] up because of some excitement Peter was
[53:47] there who do the men say that I am
[53:50] you're a prophet Jeremiah lice or one of
[53:53] the prophets but who do
[53:55] and here the revelations thou art the
[53:57] Christ the Son of the Living God blessed
[54:00] art thou Simon son of Jonah by Jonah
[54:02] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[54:04] thee but my father in heaven has
[54:06] revealed it and upon this rock I'll
[54:08] build my church I'm going to build you
[54:10] on the revelation of Who I am in your
[54:12] season hallelujah so there was Peter
[54:14] here comes the Christ into the city
[54:17] hallelujah and you know there were the
[54:19] disciples maybe the woman at the well
[54:21] was there I don't know but there were
[54:22] more than just people caught up in the
[54:24] excitement of what God was doing there
[54:26] were those thing that were part of the
[54:28] fulfillment I mean of them coming to the
[54:30] earth earlier there were those you know
[54:33] that when the angel announced his birth
[54:34] he shall call his name Jesus for he
[54:37] shall save his people from their sins
[54:39] right he died for the sins of the whole
[54:41] world to bring it to judgment but he
[54:43] died specifically for you for me
[54:46] hallelujah if there's only one it went
[54:48] to Calvary for Here I am
[54:50] lelou you that there's one going in the
[54:52] rapture Here I am holy I don't know
[54:55] about you but I'm going I mean because
[54:57] he can god I said you're part of this in
[55:00] time
[55:00] you're part of the word I can't leave
[55:02] here upon this earth I have to take you
[55:04] I have to change your body so there's
[55:11] one going give me that one but the key
[55:16] is don't look at everyone else around
[55:18] you
[55:18] oh I can't measure up to this person or
[55:21] this or I can't be like this person you
[55:23] weren't made to be like that person
[55:24] otherwise you'd be their clone but God
[55:28] God's not a cookie cutter right we have
[55:31] all part of the body to manifest and
[55:33] we're all made individual and God wants
[55:36] us how we are some are quiet blurry so
[55:39] I'm allowed hallelujah I thought then
[55:41] summer in the in the spectrum that's
[55:43] fine right be you you know the greatest
[55:47] victory we can have is when we get
[55:48] comfortable in our own skin
[55:50] there's a lot of overcoming right there
[55:52] when you're not all y'all this one
[55:54] trying to your head you're trying
[55:56] fighting and your five things now if
[55:58] you're just comfortable in your own skin
[56:01] then you won't compare with anyone you
[56:03] know all did your sim I love them for
[56:04] them but God made me me hallelujah
[56:08] that song you know thank you I made a
[56:11] Bible in schools yeah yeah if I was a
[56:14] fuzzy wuzzy be right thank you Lord for
[56:15] my fuzzy wasn't here and if I was a
[56:17] caterpillar or a butterfly but thank you
[56:20] Father for making me me because you gave
[56:23] me a hug you made me a child you know
[56:25] who gave me Jesus yeah who knows the
[56:27] song yes yes we need to learn some songs
[56:29] we but but thank you Father for making
[56:32] me me God may God don't make no mistakes
[56:36] do you think he made a mistake you think
[56:39] the mold was slightly broken or he had
[56:41] to you know when you're coming out now
[56:42] God makes no mistakes hallelujah he made
[56:47] you for a purpose and we were going to
[56:49] find that purpose it was to be the
[56:51] little toenail on the little toe
[56:53] hallelujah of the body upon the thumb
[56:55] praise the Lord if I'm the shoulder
[56:57] blade glory whatever I may be if I'm the
[56:59] bellybutton whatever as long as I'm part
[57:02] of the body of Christ that's all that
[57:04] matters
[57:05] Amen upon the coal and if I'm the small
[57:08] intestine whatever it doesn't matter if
[57:11] I'm just a little bit of the lung that
[57:12] absorbs the oxygen hallelujah I may
[57:15] never be seen but it's the inward parts
[57:17] that are most important it's not the
[57:19] outward bits that everyone sees it's the
[57:21] inward part of the body that's the most
[57:23] precious part of the body
[57:24] if you break the small bone in your
[57:26] small toe you'll know oh yeah why and in
[57:29] the whole body you'll walk different the
[57:31] whole body starts to walk a bit
[57:32] different because of one little break of
[57:34] one little bones and when when the bones
[57:37] not broken you never think about it a
[57:39] member when it's broken you're all
[57:41] focused upon it
[57:42] I saw stir s the n-word past many times
[57:46] that you know they're the most important
[57:48] bits but as long as I'm part of the body
[57:50] I can't remember who said it but even if
[57:52] I'm the skin on the bottom of the sole
[57:54] of the foot I'm still above the devil
[57:56] hallelujah so even if I'm the lowest
[57:59] part of the body I'm still above the
[58:01] devil I'm still part of the body
[58:04] Alleluia amen so the whole city was
[58:07] moved who is this it was God coming
[58:12] hallelujah to manifest the first part of
[58:15] Redemption
[58:16] now other Brown says would you see how
[58:21] this goes but you know there's something
[58:23] well it's gonna go I want to plow this
[58:26] through the believer the bride loves his
[58:30] appearing
[58:31] she loves how he manifests himself that
[58:34] she loves every gift right
[58:37] every gift of the body she loves I mean
[58:40] the Bible says we know no man after the
[58:43] flesh right this was his in Corinthians
[58:46] he this is hit yo we we used to know
[58:48] Jesus after the flesh but henceforth we
[58:51] know him no more that way and we know no
[58:53] men after the flesh so if we are cuddly
[58:56] minded we will know each other after our
[58:59] personality amen our culture our
[59:01] mannerisms whatever it is on that person
[59:04] does this and this unless they're
[59:05] different like this way that's been
[59:06] carnal that's knowing them after the
[59:08] flesh right but if we do not know each
[59:11] other after the flesh but we can
[59:13] identify that's the word that's the word
[59:15] that's the bride that's the bride that's
[59:18] part of his body that part of his body
[59:19] that's part of his body then we don't
[59:21] know each other after the flesh we know
[59:24] each other after who we are in him
[59:26] and that is the most important thing and
[59:29] that's why we can be so diverse as we
[59:31] are for many different nations and
[59:33] generations and whatever more I mean
[59:35] because we do not know each other after
[59:37] the flesh we know her if we know each
[59:39] other
[59:40] according because we're baptized into
[59:41] the same body by his Spirit Alleluia so
[59:46] the bride loves his appearing hallelujah
[59:49] the bride loves when he manifests his
[59:51] word Amen if it's even if it's just in a
[59:54] conversation or in a service or in a
[59:57] prayer meeting or have someone dresses
[59:59] or how someone acts and then we love
[1:00:02] when his word becomes flesh I mean the
[1:00:04] devil always hates it when the word
[1:00:07] become flesh I'm
[1:00:08] he he doesn't it's always when the word
[1:00:10] becomes flesh the devil begins to fight
[1:00:12] I'm in the scribes and Pharisees they
[1:00:15] would have spent I don't know how many
[1:00:17] years debating what's the Messiah gonna
[1:00:20] be like and they had the scribes and the
[1:00:22] Pharisees the Sadducees and believe in a
[1:00:24] resurrection that's why they said you
[1:00:26] see and you know and you know they never
[1:00:28] heard that one before
[1:00:30] dad you see that I believe in a
[1:00:32] resurrection and you know but they had
[1:00:33] all their debate and that was all fine
[1:00:35] but then when the prophecy became
[1:00:38] interpreted when God said no you have
[1:00:42] your ideas but I'll show you cuz God
[1:00:43] fulfills his word by bringing it to pass
[1:00:46] so we can talk well how's this going to
[1:00:48] be and how's this going to be like we
[1:00:50] can talk about the Millennium I'll say
[1:00:52] well we'll see it when it comes to pass
[1:00:54] and that's the right interpretation
[1:00:56] there on but you know talking about the
[1:00:58] Messiah and well may you he'll do this
[1:01:00] and maybe this and they had their ideas
[1:01:01] and how he was going to come and then
[1:01:03] God says no I'll show you I'll fulfill
[1:01:05] it but it's when it's when the Messiah
[1:01:08] you know no doubt many many fathers when
[1:01:12] they had their little you know girls
[1:01:13] about the right age a virgin shall
[1:01:15] conceive and they all thought no doubt
[1:01:18] my daughter is going to be the one my
[1:01:22] one is going to be the one and they
[1:01:24] maybe would have talked about and
[1:01:25] debated it and there was no reproach
[1:01:28] about talking about the scripture as an
[1:01:30] idea there's no reproach in that but
[1:01:34] it's when a little woman young teenage
[1:01:36] girl was walking down and Nazareth and a
[1:01:40] man appeared to her about six foot
[1:01:42] shoulder length here all of conflict um
[1:01:44] yo complexion called her by name Mary a
[1:01:49] highly beloved favorite of the Lord and
[1:01:52] they began to have a conversation and
[1:01:54] she said how can these things be she has
[1:01:56] trouble you know there you'll said fear
[1:01:57] not and then she just came to the
[1:01:59] conclusion let it be unto me according
[1:02:01] to thy word and then now she had a
[1:02:03] testimony she met an angel no one else
[1:02:08] was there no one else was there when it
[1:02:10] happened but she met an angel she met
[1:02:13] one who was saying the prophecy maybe
[1:02:15] you heard about in the synagogue lujah
[1:02:18] is no longer just a prophecy it's going
[1:02:20] to become reality
[1:02:22] it's gonna become present hallelujah and
[1:02:24] then she and it and that's the thing now
[1:02:27] you imagine that an angel comes to you
[1:02:31] you're going in a rapture you're the
[1:02:34] Bride of Christ
[1:02:35] you're gonna fulfill you're gonna break
[1:02:38] the cycle of death I mean you're going
[1:02:40] to break the cycle of the ages that you
[1:02:42] will not die but you're gonna you're
[1:02:44] your atoms are going to be changed you
[1:02:47] know we made in the image of the word
[1:02:48] amen and God's gonna come and take you
[1:02:50] from this world hallelujah you know and
[1:02:53] wouldn't you think everyone would be
[1:02:54] happy for you wouldn't you think that
[1:02:58] that's like Mary I made an angel imagine
[1:03:02] that she walked under wishes going she
[1:03:05] comes back into the house she would have
[1:03:07] been you would have been him you'd be
[1:03:08] impacted by having that kind of
[1:03:10] visitation you'd be different maybe she
[1:03:12] walked in a little bit different I don't
[1:03:14] know people say you okay Mary you're
[1:03:18] thinking how can I know she's no doubt
[1:03:20] thinking how can I just how how can I
[1:03:22] share this how can I tell them what just
[1:03:25] happened cuz it it's very hard to
[1:03:27] explain when God comes it's very hard to
[1:03:31] really give the magnitude of when he
[1:03:33] steps into a place and he speaks and he
[1:03:35] calls you by name and he changes your
[1:03:37] life you're gonna try and put it in
[1:03:39] words but unless you've had the
[1:03:40] experience I mean it's very hard to you
[1:03:42] know put yourself there and then so
[1:03:44] maybe she said I was walking to the well
[1:03:47] I don't know wishes go just say sure
[1:03:49] yeah just say she's going to the well I
[1:03:51] meet a man it's a different kind of a
[1:03:54] man there's such an atmosphere around
[1:03:55] him and he and he knew my name and I
[1:04:00] didn't know how he knew my name and he
[1:04:01] said he is he was Gabriel than you who
[1:04:03] Gabriel was hallelujah and he said I'm
[1:04:06] going to have the Messiah I'm going to
[1:04:09] be the Virgin that's gonna conceive and
[1:04:11] I said let it be unto me according to
[1:04:13] thy word
[1:04:14] now what do you think people see are you
[1:04:18] sure has your engagement with Joseph
[1:04:21] going amen everyone wasn't the whole
[1:04:25] world wasn't excited
[1:04:27] it wasn't front-page news the Messiah's
[1:04:29] coming to the earth
[1:04:30] Isaiah seminars there 9 is being
[1:04:32] fulfilled holy it's no longer promises
[1:04:35] week
[1:04:35] coming reality they weren't all excited
[1:04:38] I mean she received a you know what they
[1:04:41] call the black name against her you know
[1:04:43] our Joseph was just trying to cover it
[1:04:45] up and all these things but she met the
[1:04:47] angel and our testimonies will bring her
[1:04:51] approach amen

[1:05:11] faith because you've given me the faith
[1:05:13] of the Son of God Here I am
[1:05:15] hallelujah where the answer to that
[1:05:17] question I mean so minute gyro saw L saw
[1:05:20] her testimony was her approach to her
[1:05:22] but she made an angel and no one could
[1:05:25] talk her out of it and it doesn't matter
[1:05:27] how pregnant she became she knew that
[1:05:29] that child was God's God created the egg
[1:05:33] and the sperm God created the body of
[1:05:35] Christ in her womb it was God's doing it
[1:05:38] doesn't matter what people said God said
[1:05:41] hallelujah hallelujah so now that's why
[1:05:47] we've just got overjoyed what is God you
[1:05:50] know I trust he's called you amen and he
[1:05:53] called you for a purpose we're not here
[1:05:56] just to have some kind of religion and
[1:05:58] we're here to go on a rapture I mean we
[1:06:00] have yeah the Prophet told us when when
[1:06:03] the token was put on display in in in
[1:06:05] Egypt it was a sure token I mean it was
[1:06:09] a guaranteed sure token then the first
[1:06:12] bomb could not die I mean if the token
[1:06:14] was applied it was a sure definite 100
[1:06:17] percent it will work there was no doubt
[1:06:20] if they followed the prophets
[1:06:22] instructions death would not track the
[1:06:24] house I mean and we've received amen of
[1:06:27] Moses in our day
[1:06:28] I mean he's given us a clear your
[1:06:31] interpretation of the scripture and if
[1:06:33] we follow it well what was the first
[1:06:34] thing you'd repent and be baptized every
[1:06:36] one even name our Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:06:38] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:06:40] Ghost for the promises unto you
[1:06:42] whose you
[1:06:44] amen and those are a far-off who's them
[1:06:47] and meaning it's the Lord our God shall
[1:06:48] call hallelujah so yeah we've received
[1:06:53] and we received Bible evidence and it
[1:06:56] works well what's that Bible evidence
[1:06:59] God comes and lives God confirms his
[1:07:01] word with signs following
[1:07:03] I mean God changes the life it's not us
[1:07:05] transforming trying to change ourselves
[1:07:06] it's God changing us
[1:07:09] hallelujah so now so the people in Egypt
[1:07:15] the firstborns brother brown dramatized
[1:07:18] he says you know the first of all hey
[1:07:19] daddy hey sure is everything going to be
[1:07:22] okay you know I can hear the screams out
[1:07:26] of the Egyptians and everyone who has
[1:07:27] and applied the blood is everything
[1:07:29] going to be okay
[1:07:30] and you can say yes son we're followed a
[1:07:33] vindicated prophets voice I mean that
[1:07:36] same God that's brought judgment upon
[1:07:37] Egypt has brought us deliverance and
[1:07:39] we're leaving this place the bloods on
[1:07:42] the door lintel we have in faith we have
[1:07:44] applied the blood in faith we have
[1:07:46] received the word in faith we've done
[1:07:48] what God has commanded us to do and we
[1:07:50] are sure among friends
[1:07:54] God said Let there be Sun Moon and stars
[1:07:57] and what do you see when you look at the
[1:07:59] night sky when there's no city lights
[1:08:00] moon and stars he said let there be this
[1:08:04] earth what do we you know it's here
[1:08:06] right when he said let it know I'll be a
[1:08:10] bit ridiculous
[1:08:11] but when he said let there be you know
[1:08:14] let there be this earth it's not a
[1:08:17] doughnut in the sky it's not a flat
[1:08:20] earth on four elephants on a tortoise
[1:08:22] it's not something that when he said it
[1:08:25] was it became he followed me it's not
[1:08:28] something completely different I mean so
[1:08:30] when God promises something it has to
[1:08:32] happen you follow me so when he said
[1:08:35] apply the blood the first one won't die
[1:08:37] death will not strike what happened
[1:08:39] death did it strike I mean when he said
[1:08:41] to Moses raise up your rod before the
[1:08:43] Red Sea where what happened the Red Sea
[1:08:44] parted I mean when they went to Jericho
[1:08:47] and Joshua was taught by the angel of
[1:08:49] the Lord to too much around and so on
[1:08:52] what happened the walls fell down flat
[1:08:54] hallelujah you just go through the
[1:08:56] scripture God's promise and God's
[1:08:58] promise that he does exactly what he's
[1:08:59] promised I mean so we could have supreme
[1:09:02] confidence if he did it all the way back
[1:09:03] there and if you were back there you
[1:09:06] would be a believer hallelujah if you
[1:09:08] are the same generation as Caleb and
[1:09:10] Joshua there would have been three that
[1:09:12] went into land
[1:09:13] Caleb Joshua and you hallelujah
[1:09:15] hallelujah
[1:09:16] why could you you know if you're living
[1:09:19] the days of Noah there would have been
[1:09:20] nine in the ark yes Damon you hallelujah
[1:09:23] why because the same faith you have you
[1:09:25] would have had the same faith back then
[1:09:26] because me but man doesn't change
[1:09:28] whatever you are now you would have been
[1:09:30] back then if you make believer now you
[1:09:32] be you make believe it in if you're a
[1:09:34] dad and now you'll be a doubter then but
[1:09:35] if you're believing now you'll be a
[1:09:36] believer then hallelujah so we don't
[1:09:39] need to worry did the blood work back
[1:09:41] there if couldn't strike death could not
[1:09:44] strike the house because the blood was
[1:09:47] applied and we have more than just a
[1:09:49] chemistry of a blood we have the life
[1:09:52] that was in the blood when Jesus went to
[1:09:54] Calvary amen his blood was shed the life
[1:09:57] in him was released Holly there could
[1:09:59] come upon a people and transform them
[1:10:02] and make them like him hallelujah
[1:10:04] hallelujah that's a short token amen I
[1:10:08] met a face death your death has to flee
[1:10:11] if he's in the house it has to flee
[1:10:13] because now there is life with darkness
[1:10:16] used to be now there is hope there's no
[1:10:18] more doubt I mean because he is here
[1:10:20] he's in the house

[1:15:14] well same thing today when you see his
[1:15:16] work now we have already seen in a
[1:15:19] witnessing the appearing of the Lord now
[1:15:21] remember the appearing in the coming as
[1:15:22] two different words to appear and then
[1:15:24] to come now is the appearing he's
[1:15:26] already appeared in these last days
[1:15:28] right here with us in the last few years
[1:15:31] now it's a sign of his coming he's
[1:15:33] appearing in his church in the form of
[1:15:35] the Holy Spirit showing that it's him
[1:15:37] because people cannot do these things
[1:15:38] that you see the Holy Spirit doing so
[1:15:40] that's the appearing of the Lord now you
[1:15:42] remember it spoken both places appearing
[1:15:45] and coming now we're going to come back
[1:15:47] to that he says also here cousin we
[1:15:49] would see Jesus after 2,000 years we see
[1:15:52] the infallible proof that we can still
[1:15:55] see Jesus he's appearing in our myths
[1:15:57] he's appearing in our myths
[1:16:00] hallelujah just before us coming he's
[1:16:02] making his appearance in his church
[1:16:04] the last sign that he did before the
[1:16:06] Jews and he was he was finished with
[1:16:08] them the last sign that he given before
[1:16:10] the Gentiles was finished in his being
[1:16:11] showed we know that that was the last
[1:16:14] time that Abraham got before Sodom
[1:16:16] burned it was the last time we realized
[1:16:18] that the ministers out there at Sodom
[1:16:20] tonight bring revivals going on through
[1:16:21] Chicago and across the world great signs
[1:16:23] and wonders are taking place ministers
[1:16:25] preaching crying their hearts out
[1:16:27] pastors are pleading and begging great
[1:16:29] wonders are being done by the Holy Ghost
[1:16:30] throughout the world healing signs and
[1:16:32] wonders we are so he says he's appearing
[1:16:36] among us hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:39] but now brother Brown picks up 1st
[1:16:42] Thessalonians chapter 4 he says the Lord
[1:16:45] does three things as he descends now
[1:16:49] let's just go there you're with me first
[1:16:53] it's loneliness for
[1:17:03] I'll find it I'm glad this is not a
[1:17:08] funeral text hey is that there's a takes
[1:17:12] of life hallelujah amen he says this now
[1:17:17] before we say unto you this is first
[1:17:19] Thessalonians 4:15 for this we say unto
[1:17:21] you by the coming of the Lord that we
[1:17:23] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:17:26] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:17:27] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:17:29] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:17:30] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:17:32] and the Trump of God and the first and
[1:17:34] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[1:17:36] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:17:38] caught up together with them in the
[1:17:39] clouds to meet the lord in the air so
[1:17:42] shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore
[1:17:43] comfort one another with these words
[1:17:45] but over times and the seasons brethren
[1:17:48] you have no need that I write unto you
[1:17:50] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[1:17:52] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[1:17:55] the night for when they shall say peace
[1:17:57] and safety then sudden destruction
[1:17:58] cometh upon them as travail upon a woman
[1:18:01] with child and they shall not escape but
[1:18:04] ye brethren are not in darkness put
[1:18:07] yourself in that scripture but ye are
[1:18:09] not in darkness I mean that that they
[1:18:11] should overtake you as a thief here all
[1:18:13] the children of light and the children
[1:18:14] of the day we are not of the night nor
[1:18:17] of darkness therefore let us not sleep
[1:18:19] as do others but let us watch and be
[1:18:21] sober for they that sleep sleep in the
[1:18:23] night they did a drunken are drunken in
[1:18:25] the night but let us who are of the day
[1:18:27] be sober putting on the breastplate of
[1:18:29] faith and love and for a helmet the hope
[1:18:32] of salvation for God has not appointed
[1:18:35] us to wrath but to obtain salvation by
[1:18:38] our Lord Jesus Christ I mean so he so he
[1:18:42] takes this any-any speech the rapture
[1:18:45] message and he says that now the Lord
[1:18:48] does three things as he is descending I
[1:18:51] mean first is the shout then the voice
[1:18:54] and the trumpet Jesus does all these
[1:18:56] three things when he's descending I mean
[1:18:59] first as a shout it's the message going
[1:19:00] forth I am in the Living bread of life
[1:19:03] bringing forth the bride hallelujah and
[1:19:06] in the second stage the voice of the
[1:19:09] Archangel now
[1:19:10] you take a natural harvest it's the
[1:19:13] condition of the wheat that tells the
[1:19:16] farmer that the harvest needs to happen
[1:19:18] right it's not the farmer just putting a
[1:19:21] date on the calendar saying well I think
[1:19:22] I'll harvest the field now no he goes
[1:19:24] out and looks at his field and when the
[1:19:27] field is all ready and mature not when
[1:19:30] it's half green and half golden when
[1:19:32] it's all golden when it's all ready then
[1:19:35] he says boys we're going to harvest this
[1:19:36] field hallelujah so now there's a the
[1:19:40] shout has come but this message is the
[1:19:43] shout hallelujah
[1:19:44] the shout as the mrs. brother Brahim
[1:19:46] says I mean and that is the living to
[1:19:48] bring forth the living bread to bring
[1:19:51] forth the living bride so it's a word
[1:19:53] that will produce the bride hallelujah
[1:19:55] cause it's the true interpretation of
[1:19:57] the scripture it is the Word of God amen
[1:19:59] and so now the second stage now is the
[1:20:02] voice of the Archangel which is the life
[1:20:04] of God comes into full maturity in a
[1:20:06] people amen when's the reps are going to
[1:20:09] go God looks down and says the field of
[1:20:11] the wheat is mature what was planted in
[1:20:14] the beginning has now been produced at
[1:20:15] the end Amen Jesus is on the Alpha and
[1:20:18] the Omega the beginning and the end it's
[1:20:21] what you see the beginning church dude
[1:20:23] and live hallelujah God living in the
[1:20:26] immense God appearing among them God
[1:20:28] manifesting himself and that manner it
[1:20:30] will appear at the end in the same
[1:20:32] manner because it's the same ones who at
[1:20:34] the beginning the same life as at the
[1:20:35] end hallelujah
[1:20:37] so now so the voice of the Archangel is
[1:20:39] the life of God in you hallelujah and
[1:20:43] that life comes to a maturity now I'll
[1:20:46] just say this what we think maturity is
[1:20:47] and what God sees can be two very
[1:20:49] different things because we look at our
[1:20:50] humanity and we beat ourselves up and
[1:20:52] say we're green as green can be we may
[1:20:54] not be that green hellooo yeah amen so
[1:20:58] we need to when God says we're ready
[1:21:02] then we're going Allu yeah the sunlight
[1:21:05] is shining we're in a harvest season the
[1:21:08] word is getting stronger the sunlights
[1:21:10] getting stronger I mean the sunlight
[1:21:12] always gets stronger and brighter as the
[1:21:14] harvest is coming closer the word has
[1:21:16] come open like never before
[1:21:17] hallelujah you're following me I trust
[1:21:20] you
[1:21:20] I trust when you read the scriptures
[1:21:22] listen to the message it grips you so
[1:21:24] much more than at first it means so much
[1:21:26] more to you now than it did when you
[1:21:27] first heard it I mean it's more richest
[1:21:29] more alive
[1:21:30] hallelujah means a lot more I mean you
[1:21:33] see Jesus Christ is more personal he's
[1:21:35] not an abstract bunch of theories but
[1:21:36] he's a living God oh yeah I trust he's
[1:21:40] that way to you well what's happening
[1:21:41] the sunlight is getting stronger I mean
[1:21:44] as the sunlight that produces the
[1:21:45] harvest hallelujah glory to God and so
[1:21:49] now the second part is now when the
[1:21:51] bride comes to full maturity then
[1:21:57] there's a the life and uses now harvest
[1:21:59] me I mean you look at the life that's on
[1:22:03] display in the wheat field
[1:22:04] what's it crying out crying out to the
[1:22:06] farmer I'm ready
[1:22:07] bring the combine I don't want to stay
[1:22:10] in this place take me to another place
[1:22:13] hallelujah hallelujah amen there's one
[1:22:16] granary there's one barn
[1:22:18] it says the wheat will be gathered into
[1:22:20] the barn hallelujah so there's a life in
[1:22:23] us saying come Lord Jesus come Lord
[1:22:25] Jesus and not because the world's
[1:22:27] getting dark necessarily it will wax
[1:22:29] worse and worse we know that but the
[1:22:31] reason is is a life in us crying out I'm
[1:22:33] here to be taken I'm here I'm ready you
[1:22:37] have made me really hallelujah that's
[1:22:39] where we are
[1:22:40] isn't that wonderful we should rejoice I
[1:22:43] see we have a shirt Oken I'm just want I
[1:22:45] feel to go back to there just hammer it
[1:22:46] a little bit and then we ever short
[1:22:48] token if you have the Holy Ghost you're
[1:22:50] sealed into the kingdom
[1:22:51] it goes beyond emotion it will produce a
[1:22:53] motion Oh hallelujah
[1:22:56] emotion comes with it right but there's
[1:22:58] a problem is sometimes we see people
[1:23:00] shout and cry and scream and our
[1:23:02] experience can be different and we say
[1:23:04] well I need to have that but you may not
[1:23:07] need to have that because God is
[1:23:09] individual if he's made himself real to
[1:23:11] you he's changed your life and you can
[1:23:13] see that he is changing you what's that
[1:23:15] his life is coming forth but the devil
[1:23:19] always tries to make us think you need
[1:23:20] to have this kind of experience as your
[1:23:22] experience great enough when you get
[1:23:23] this great enough experience then you've
[1:23:24] really got it that's the devil lying to
[1:23:28] you are you with me amen because then
[1:23:31] we're because then we don't even realize
[1:23:33] what we even
[1:23:34] if we try and look at something that
[1:23:36] some pie-in-the-sky amen it's when the
[1:23:39] life comes in and changes you amen and
[1:23:43] your heart has turned completely all you
[1:23:45] want to do is serve the Lord amen yo
[1:23:48] when you meet God it doesn't mean every
[1:23:50] other desires turned off and you become
[1:23:52] a robot we're still in this flesh this
[1:23:55] flesh has desires this flesh wants to do
[1:23:57] a lot of things you follow me I hope
[1:23:59] this comes out the right way because
[1:24:01] this thing needs to be changed but just
[1:24:03] because this thing wants to be lazy and
[1:24:05] do nothing and whatever it doesn't mean
[1:24:08] I'm not a believer amen
[1:24:10] it's just this first nature that I still
[1:24:13] as in this flesh but if the Lord is in
[1:24:15] you then his life is greater than this
[1:24:18] but it depends what you yield yourself
[1:24:21] to amen it depends what you yield
[1:24:24] yourself to and brother BAM says even if
[1:24:26] you have the least desire to serve God
[1:24:29] he doesn't say the only desire he said
[1:24:32] the least desire so you can have the
[1:24:34] smallest desire but the and you could
[1:24:36] have other greater desires we said if
[1:24:38] you have just the least desire amen and
[1:24:41] that's all you need take that least
[1:24:43] desire right and serve God with it get
[1:24:47] the Holy Ghost with it God God had to
[1:24:49] equip us with something
[1:24:51] amen because we're in this age it's ten
[1:24:53] times harder right brother brahim says
[1:24:56] about how it's ten times harder for the
[1:24:58] young ones that it is my generation but
[1:25:00] yet pastors and mothers and fathers pray
[1:25:02] half the time as they used to who knows
[1:25:05] the quote so it's 10 times harder with
[1:25:08] half the help that's what he's saying
[1:25:10] so then how how can we ever overcome
[1:25:13] actually push her and be sealed in he
[1:25:15] gave us a desire you've got to see what
[1:25:17] he's given you to fight with right
[1:25:20] because sometimes we think well when I
[1:25:22] get the Holy Ghost and I'll be a
[1:25:23] Christian no you've got to take the
[1:25:25] desire you have and fight with that I
[1:25:28] mean it's just like a little baby eagle
[1:25:30] in the egg it has a desire I must push
[1:25:33] through I must push through this egg it
[1:25:35] doesn't know about flying it doesn't
[1:25:37] know what mama looks like it doesn't
[1:25:39] know what it's like to sweep down and
[1:25:41] catch its prey and make a nest and do
[1:25:43] all the Eagle things but it has a desire
[1:25:46] I've got to
[1:25:47] get out I don't like the signal more
[1:25:50] it's too restricting
[1:25:51] I want to live a greater life than just
[1:25:53] this one and attack centers are in a
[1:25:56] picks and a picture and a picks and a
[1:25:58] picks and then eventually pushes its
[1:26:00] head out maybe because I'm you know make
[1:26:03] the get bigger and it pushes that pushes
[1:26:05] out it flops out of the gig hallelujah
[1:26:08] it's free hallelujah amen glory you'll
[1:26:13] remember that time hallelujah as a
[1:26:15] glorious time baby you know you gotta
[1:26:18] take what you have that's why you know
[1:26:20] the devil always tries to make us think
[1:26:23] are we even saved amen are we even going
[1:26:26] to make it
[1:26:27] does he not take your emotions and you
[1:26:29] know spiritual realm and use it against
[1:26:31] you
[1:26:31] or is it just me okay I'm glad we're all
[1:26:34] common here please
[1:26:35] I'm glad that you can relate to me Allu
[1:26:38] yeah so he will take our emotions and
[1:26:40] beat us down with them you know one day
[1:26:42] we feel like you know like here we're
[1:26:44] shouting and rejoicing everything's
[1:26:45] going wonderful we think well I've
[1:26:47] arrived hallelujah and then you walk out
[1:26:50] those doors and the devil just goes like
[1:26:52] this and you think my how am I ever
[1:26:54] going to get there
[1:26:55] does that change your salvation doesn't
[1:26:59] change it one bit doesn't change it one
[1:27:01] iota I mean we're not saved because we
[1:27:04] feel it amen we're not saved we're not
[1:27:08] going in a rapture because we feel it
[1:27:10] we're going in a rapture and we know
[1:27:11] we're saved because we believe it I mean
[1:27:14] it's just like healing people get out of
[1:27:16] the wheelchair they got to keep
[1:27:17] believing and then yeah yeah brother I
[1:27:20] see is maybe if you can just wiggle your
[1:27:21] little toe just wiggle wet then wiggle
[1:27:24] your whole whole foot and then your leg
[1:27:26] and then stop hobbling start walking
[1:27:27] what's happening your faith is causing
[1:27:29] your body to come subject to your faith
[1:27:32] hallelujah our faith is here to dictate
[1:27:35] to this body amen this flesh is not here
[1:27:39] to have dominion over our souls I mean
[1:27:41] the Spirit in us is here to have
[1:27:43] dominion over the sky hallelujah so you
[1:27:46] know and he says but then if you start
[1:27:47] doubting what happens then you'll end up
[1:27:50] crippled again that's why you got to
[1:27:52] keep just keep believing you're healed
[1:27:55] as long as you believe it right you're
[1:27:57] saved as long as you believe it and
[1:27:59] can can can twist your thinking around
[1:28:02] that you think well where am I
[1:28:03] then what happens you're all you don't
[1:28:05] know where you are you following me
[1:28:08] remember you can be sealed I want to be
[1:28:10] fully maybe I'll just say this if you
[1:28:12] have the Holy Ghost you seal to the day
[1:28:14] of your redemption yep
[1:28:16] we can grieve from away that doesn't
[1:28:18] mean we're not sealed right but I don't
[1:28:21] want to live a life where I'm sealed
[1:28:23] unto the kingdom then the devil sucker
[1:28:25] punches me and I basically immobilize
[1:28:27] the rest of the walk you follow me I
[1:28:30] want to have the most effective walk
[1:28:31] amen I have one life to live one life to
[1:28:35] give why not run well amen and even if
[1:28:40] you trip it's not him that falls it's
[1:28:42] him that gets up those are the
[1:28:44] overcomers hallelujah he said I've been
[1:28:47] getting up a lot but it's always that
[1:28:49] one more time you get up it's always the
[1:28:51] one as long as the times getting up is
[1:28:53] one more than the time falling you're
[1:28:55] good hallelujah hallelujah but a mess
[1:28:58] amen
[1:28:59] as long as as long as it's one more okay
[1:29:02] we just got to keep pushing on he say
[1:29:05] well I don't know if I'll ever get there
[1:29:07] as I said he created the world's by his
[1:29:11] word he sent His Word to you you've
[1:29:14] received that word it's transformed you
[1:29:17] do you believe the word has effect in
[1:29:18] your life I trust it does I trust you
[1:29:21] believe it does and then you've received
[1:29:23] that word
[1:29:23] you see it's transforming power in your
[1:29:25] life he's not going to quit on you don't
[1:29:27] quit on him amen don't don't quit on him
[1:29:31] don't get frustrated at him he's not the
[1:29:33] author of frustration it's going to
[1:29:35] prove his salvation amen yes hallelujah
[1:29:40] now amen so he sees here so I think I
[1:29:46] read this last two Sundays ago so I
[1:29:50] could probably read it again it might be
[1:29:51] long enough they see the seed is not
[1:29:53] here with the shook now the same logos
[1:29:55] has a part he's got a bride and the same
[1:29:57] logos this word that cannot be tempered
[1:30:00] with as brooding over the church today
[1:30:02] trying to bring back the word to its
[1:30:04] full manifestation amen and this is the
[1:30:09] age we're living in he's brooding over
[1:30:11] us that's why he moves among us because
[1:30:13] he wondered
[1:30:13] a full manifestation of his word not
[1:30:15] just a part of it but the fullness amen
[1:30:18] he says he says the bride knows where
[1:30:20] she stands I trust you know where you
[1:30:23] stand
[1:30:24] that's why saying we have a shirt oaken
[1:30:26] and brother and says it makes us so
[1:30:28] relaxed he say in this tension nervous H
[1:30:33] we can feel relaxed absolutely because
[1:30:36] if you keep your mind stayed upon him
[1:30:38] you shall have perfect peace what are
[1:30:41] you looking at he looking at your
[1:30:42] situation what's going on life are you
[1:30:45] looking at the token Amen that's why we
[1:30:48] shouldn't like I said Joe applied the
[1:30:50] token out of fear for his family he
[1:30:52] wasn't applying it out of faith he still
[1:30:54] applied it which was good but he's
[1:30:56] applying it out of fear he was
[1:30:57] sacrificing their behalf out of fear
[1:30:59] lest they've sinned right
[1:31:01] but we shouldn't apply the same faith
[1:31:03] that saved you you use it upon your
[1:31:05] children you use it upon your families
[1:31:07] amen you go after them in faith right
[1:31:09] that's how you apply the token create an
[1:31:11] atmosphere around you let me see they'll
[1:31:13] fall into it show us the world
[1:31:15] hallelujah but we should what are we
[1:31:17] focusing upon I mean this world is going
[1:31:20] to be a nervous neurotic stressed busy
[1:31:23] age we can't change it even if we move
[1:31:27] to some even if we made some commune or
[1:31:31] whatever more there will come a time
[1:31:34] where it becomes busy nervous stressed
[1:31:37] environment it may just change what it
[1:31:40] looks like but it'll still be that way
[1:31:41] why cuz it's the spirit in this world we
[1:31:44] can't we can't hide from it you go to
[1:31:46] Africa you go to Papua New Guinea you go
[1:31:48] anywhere it'll still be there they'll
[1:31:51] still be pressure amen but we have a
[1:31:53] place where we can lid off the pressure
[1:31:55] hallelujah there is a place where we can
[1:31:57] let off the pressure well we don't need
[1:31:59] to be worried about what's going on and
[1:32:02] then we the name of the Lord is a strong
[1:32:04] tower and the righteous run into it and
[1:32:06] are safe I mean that's why we need to
[1:32:09] gather as a body come into the
[1:32:11] atmosphere of God and lid off the
[1:32:13] pressure in the presence of the Lord
[1:32:14] hallelujah that's why we need to enter
[1:32:17] into his presence you can let off the
[1:32:18] pressure I mean and when you realize
[1:32:20] that you're sealed into that place we
[1:32:22] can lid off the pressure then you can
[1:32:24] rejoice
[1:32:25] we have a short token what does it mean
[1:32:28] you can be so it feels so relaxed does
[1:32:30] that mean you just kick your feet up and
[1:32:31] watch the world go by
[1:32:32] no now you have confidence what I have
[1:32:35] works I mean what I have will produce
[1:32:38] what are promises of will because
[1:32:40] remember it's not us being the Christian
[1:32:42] it's him in us amen don't leave the
[1:32:46] devil take your sincerity and beat you
[1:32:47] down with it
[1:32:48] I mean God gave you that sincerity God
[1:32:51] gave me that reverence and love for him
[1:32:53] don't let the devil beat you down with
[1:32:54] it
[1:32:55] hallelujah Amen you say Satan get behind
[1:32:58] me you want to kick him off your
[1:33:00] Mountain we put up with the devil too
[1:33:02] much we enter entertainers voice too
[1:33:05] much entertainers busyness and whatever
[1:33:08] it too much just kick them away say
[1:33:10] Satan get out of the name of Jesus
[1:33:12] Christ I'm not here to talk with you I'm
[1:33:14] here to have communion with my lord
[1:33:16] hallelujah darling the devil take your
[1:33:18] thoughts off some other place I mean
[1:33:20] that the visitation of God will you know
[1:33:22] pass you by say Satan get away go bother
[1:33:25] someone else
[1:33:26] holy I'm too busy business hours the
[1:33:32] closer and it's therefore opening again
[1:33:34] oh yeah so now we we know where we stand
[1:33:39] but give your faith for yourself brother
[1:33:43] man says use that same faith upon your
[1:33:45] family and don't worry about what they
[1:33:48] may be doing amen you know brother
[1:33:52] Graham said that the Apostle Paul he was
[1:33:54] Saul before he became Paul you know the
[1:33:58] Apostle Paul well saw when he when he
[1:34:02] consent you know he helped Stephen be
[1:34:04] stoned went to the high priest to get
[1:34:06] the papers to go to Damascus there was a
[1:34:08] man under conviction and and we would
[1:34:13] probably think how was that a man under
[1:34:15] conviction he hates he hates you Lord
[1:34:17] Jesus he's trying to destroy your people
[1:34:19] no brother Graham see that's a man under
[1:34:22] conviction he was convicted by the life
[1:34:24] he saw in Stephen he was under
[1:34:27] conviction of that and it stirred him up
[1:34:29] know sometimes we think men there's no
[1:34:31] way even the even the Apostle Paul said
[1:34:33] I bless feed but the thing is there's no
[1:34:38] way sometimes we think
[1:34:39] you know we would think of that was
[1:34:40] someone we think they're going in the
[1:34:42] other direction but there was God
[1:34:44] convicting them oh yeah and many times
[1:34:47] we pray for someone and they can end up
[1:34:50] going in the other way everything Lord
[1:34:52] how is this working out they're going in
[1:34:54] the opposite way that I'm asking you to
[1:34:55] take them but it's God dealing God is
[1:34:59] actually answering the prayer you say
[1:35:01] well that's that that seems contrary to
[1:35:03] what I'm thinking no you've got to have
[1:35:04] confidence we we walk by sight and not
[1:35:09] by faith is that right no I'm glad
[1:35:12] you're listening I send that opposite on
[1:35:14] purpose for once we walk by faith and
[1:35:17] not by sight
[1:35:18] right so we walk by faith and not by
[1:35:20] sight so we don't walk by what we see oh
[1:35:22] by what may be going on we walk by faith
[1:35:25] Allu yeah so that's why you don't look
[1:35:28] at what you see you're going to keep the
[1:35:30] promise before the Lord and walk by
[1:35:33] faith amen the bride knows where she
[1:35:36] stands in the life is in the grain again
[1:35:39] amen just exactly like the same grain
[1:35:42] that went into the ground the same Jesus
[1:35:44] in the bride form same power same church
[1:35:47] same thing same word the same word that
[1:35:49] sucked up through these and came out
[1:35:51] here and came to a here here and all
[1:35:53] that life that came through here it's
[1:35:55] picked up its people and now it's
[1:35:57] forming into a head for the rapture he
[1:36:00] says that the invisible union she's
[1:36:01] saying that the life is in the grain
[1:36:02] again we're not going through a carrier
[1:36:04] stage of reformation but now is the
[1:36:06] restoration I mean of the end time
[1:36:09] hallelujah so the same life the same
[1:36:12] Jesus is now in Brad form it's the new
[1:36:15] hallelujah
[1:36:16] after 1963 I haven't found it but I do
[1:36:19] not find where brother around speaks
[1:36:20] about the appearing of of the Lord any
[1:36:22] more he speaks about the coming I mean
[1:36:25] it goes from he's appearing among us to
[1:36:28] his coming now we know when I read and
[1:36:30] so I read there in 1st Thessalonians 4
[1:36:32] that that is the coming of the Lord or
[1:36:34] the cycle of the rapture Alleluia where
[1:36:37] he descends in three stages and then
[1:36:40] those three stages culminate and the
[1:36:43] dead in Christ raising us being changed
[1:36:45] to meet the Lord in the air
[1:36:46] so we will physically meet the Lord in
[1:36:49] the air I mean there is a physical
[1:36:51] meeting of
[1:36:52] hallelujah but then before that he comes
[1:36:56] down and he becomes one with us amen so
[1:37:00] now the bride is part of the coming of
[1:37:03] the Lord hallelujah we are part of the
[1:37:06] coming of the Lord where he comes his
[1:37:08] changes form now he's in bride form
[1:37:11] hallelujah
[1:37:12] you know hallelujah amen
[1:37:16] we are now living in this time which no
[1:37:19] longer just the appearing but it's is
[1:37:21] coming we're living in the coming of the
[1:37:23] Lord I mean we're the rapture is not
[1:37:26] just a split-second event but it's a
[1:37:29] process or a cycle and we are living in
[1:37:32] that time hallelujah
[1:37:35] you say well how do I am I going to make
[1:37:40] it if you love okay forgive me I don't
[1:37:45] hand out my glossary terms to begin with
[1:37:47] but when I speak about is appearing now
[1:37:49] and it's coming I'm thinking about the
[1:37:50] same thing right because we know that
[1:37:53] there's a crowd the Apostle Paul in our
[1:37:55] opening scripture he said there's a
[1:37:56] crown of life waiting for me and not me
[1:37:58] only but all those that love his
[1:38:00] appearing right and we are like we love
[1:38:04] his appearing his manifestation write
[1:38:06] the word appearing means manifestation
[1:38:07] speaking of a second Advent hallelujah
[1:38:10] so there's something in us when he comes
[1:38:12] down and identifies himself with a group
[1:38:15] of people we're not just caught up like
[1:38:17] the multitude with Jesus going into the
[1:38:19] city saying Hosanna and then a few days
[1:38:21] later Saint crucify them right we're not
[1:38:23] just caught up in what's going on but
[1:38:25] there's something in us saying that that
[1:38:27] we're identified with his word I learned

[1:48:51] so every time trouble comes up that's
[1:48:53] actually God giving you an opportunity
[1:48:56] amen you take I know brother on Spencer
[1:48:59] that spoke about it and the Easter
[1:49:00] convention 2009 he said about Beethoven
[1:49:03] Beethoven was a great composer but
[1:49:06] Beethoven one day began to lose his
[1:49:07] hearing that didn't mean he quit
[1:49:09] composing music
[1:49:10] he cut the legs off his piano he put it
[1:49:14] on the floor and he put his ear on the
[1:49:16] floor and he played and he began to
[1:49:19] write down he was losing his hearing he
[1:49:21] could be elite young that's how dear
[1:49:23] forgot but that hardship did not stop
[1:49:26] him expressing the gift in his life it
[1:49:30] didn't deter him he just had to make
[1:49:32] some changes I mean to overcome that
[1:49:35] what your his frailty in this human body
[1:49:38] amen
[1:49:39] I'll say this if a man I don't know what
[1:49:42] kind of faith Beethoven had but if a man
[1:49:44] just with a gift could give himself to
[1:49:47] that gift so much that he would
[1:49:49] rearrange you know he didn't quit
[1:49:51] something in him had to be expressed he
[1:49:54] couldn't stop it and had to float no
[1:49:57] matter how frustrated he died with his
[1:49:59] hearing Lee
[1:49:59] whatever more suffering in him said I
[1:50:01] must write this music I must compose
[1:50:03] this music and if a man may be a sinner
[1:50:06] I don't know but if he could do that
[1:50:08] back in that age just with a gift of
[1:50:10] music how much more the bride of Jesus
[1:50:12] Christ that had been redeemed they're
[1:50:14] being transformed by him I mean that's
[1:50:17] nothing should stop us no frustration no
[1:50:22] frustration nothing should stop us there
[1:50:24] should be something in here there must
[1:50:26] live a life that must come forth so
[1:50:29] don't let the devil ever try to
[1:50:31] discourage you or try and push you off
[1:50:33] the path I mean if the devil's trying to
[1:50:35] I'm getting a tech boy microphone if the
[1:50:38] devil if the devil's try to put you off

[1:55:29] if you think well we're back in that
[1:55:31] place right because he wants to you know
[1:55:33] it's just like a revolution you have a
[1:55:35] revolution do you think the government
[1:55:37] just quits it is bitter you take the
[1:55:41] French Revolution you take the Russian
[1:55:42] Revolution any revolution in history
[1:55:44] that's been bloody and Savage why
[1:55:48] because the people rise up the
[1:55:51] government just doesn't quit they turn
[1:55:53] all their guns against their own what
[1:55:54] they think is their own people but those
[1:55:56] people who rise up and not identified
[1:55:58] with their government no more there was
[1:56:00] a time when we were identified with the
[1:56:01] devil we loved his ways I'll be honest I
[1:56:05] la I loved in my fallen state because
[1:56:09] the human the fallen human nature is
[1:56:11] aligned with the devil that's why the
[1:56:13] world goes through towards his tricks
[1:56:16] and his nonsense is because our nature
[1:56:18] is a sin nature that we're born with but
[1:56:20] there comes a time when God comes in
[1:56:22] when you cry to him God changed my
[1:56:24] nature I don't want to just be prayed
[1:56:26] for I want to die out of that sin though
[1:56:29] I add to my son nature that I will be
[1:56:31] born again I'll be changed and
[1:56:33] have a different nature now you don't
[1:56:35] have this nature anymore so what's
[1:56:36] happening you've now risen up I will not
[1:56:38] let this one rule over me the word is
[1:56:40] now my head and do you think the devil
[1:56:43] just says well I'll quit that was fun
[1:56:44] with the next one no he gets his guns
[1:56:47] and he trains them on you
[1:56:48] he gets his armies out trying to
[1:56:50] suppress you whatever you gotta throw
[1:56:52] them off you say no no I've been
[1:56:53] liberated I'm free I'm not going back
[1:56:56] into bondage I'm not going back into our
[1:56:58] old system
[1:56:58] I'm under a new headship the Word of God
[1:57:01] hallelujah
[1:57:02] isn't that right and so now that's what
[1:57:05] the devil comes back against you because
[1:57:06] they know I'm free I'm under a new flag
[1:57:09] I'm gonna new it national anthem I've
[1:57:12] got a new passport not just a visa I'm a
[1:57:15] citizen Holly I'm a citizen of the
[1:57:18] kingdom of heaven I don't have a work
[1:57:20] visa or residency I'm a child a citizen
[1:57:23] of the kingdom hallelujah glory to God
[1:57:27] so we need to you know if the devil
[1:57:29] comes against us gotta kick them out you
[1:57:32] gotta kick them out I love we love his
[1:57:34] appearing
[1:57:35] so it doesn't matter what happens in
[1:57:37] this life doesn't matter what the devil
[1:57:39] and I'm trying to quit it doesn't matter
[1:57:42] what the devil puts against us the the
[1:57:45] Apostle Paul said no I have a crown that
[1:57:47] the righteous judge many times we think
[1:57:50] of a judges you're just gonna get
[1:57:51] penalized he's gonna be a guilty no it's
[1:57:55] like this the woman caught in adultery
[1:57:57] take him before the judge take him
[1:58:00] before the lawgiver I mean Jesus was the
[1:58:03] look everyone outside I just in a
[1:58:05] different form right so so here is the
[1:58:08] sheet they are pulling her in front of
[1:58:10] the one that gave the law he's full of
[1:58:12] grace and truth
[1:58:13] hallelujah and then now they say to him
[1:58:17] we caught this woman in adultery
[1:58:19] the very act will waste the man yeah the
[1:58:22] devil ways perverts the truth where is
[1:58:24] he I don't know where he is and then
[1:58:26] Jesus doesn't say anything but just
[1:58:27] begins to write in the sand you know we
[1:58:29] have a book of life maybe maybe he begin
[1:58:33] to write write their sins in the ground
[1:58:36] I don't know and he just said they you
[1:58:39] been without sin among you let him cast
[1:58:41] the first stone you know what happened
[1:58:44] there it was a judgment
[1:58:46] there was a judgment one party was found
[1:58:50] guilty and one party was found innocent
[1:58:52] and those scribes and Pharisees they did
[1:58:55] not expected that be the guilty ones
[1:58:57] hallelujah that's what the devil does
[1:59:00] he's made this world and he's made this
[1:59:03] face and he's and we're here and he's
[1:59:06] trying to bring us before God because
[1:59:08] God is a man of his word so if there's a
[1:59:10] penalty what good is a law without a
[1:59:12] penalty right so his word you know there
[1:59:15] are penalties in his word if you
[1:59:17] trespass it it's a man of his word so
[1:59:19] the devil knows if we won't just get
[1:59:21] these people to trespass the Word of God
[1:59:23] and unbelief then God has to judge them
[1:59:25] those dragged you here but now you have
[1:59:29] a book of life Allu you and the
[1:59:32] righteous judge by his blood wipes away
[1:59:36] all of your deeds all of your book your
[1:59:40] first book you know brother when he
[1:59:41] talks about the two books that are
[1:59:43] really just one is the book of life in
[1:59:45] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:59:46] hallelujah and it's enough he starts
[1:59:49] writing in the sand there since the
[1:59:51] devil since Amen and then they all
[1:59:55] dropped their stones that I found guilty
[1:59:56] they convicted they go off and then he
[1:59:58] just says woman were thine accusers and
[2:00:00] she says his non-lawyer
[2:00:04] neither do i condemn thee go and sin no
[2:00:06] more what happened the one who thought
[2:00:09] she was going to be stoned was actually
[2:00:12] pardoned and the ones who are guilty I
[2:00:15] mean thought they were righteous were
[2:00:16] found guilty because there aren't since
[2:00:18] around the mouth is that okay and so
[2:00:20] sorry means how do you think of a judge
[2:00:21] you're so he's going to get penalty no
[2:00:22] no Jesus has actually called us not
[2:00:25] guilty not guilty and in his court
[2:00:30] we're not guilty we're pardoned and
[2:00:33] we're more than just no they didn't
[2:00:35] actually no actually no they found no he
[2:00:38] eradicated the evidence helllooo yeah
[2:00:42] there's no evidence held against the
[2:00:44] Bride of Christ the blood eradicate sit
[2:00:47] hallelujah so why we so the righteous
[2:00:51] judge is going to give us a crown why is
[2:00:53] he going to give it to us because he's
[2:00:54] judge us righteous because of what he
[2:00:56] did on our behalf Olu yeah
[2:00:59] and we just relax now we lid off the
[2:01:02] pressure can't we just be happy a man
[2:01:06] can't we just rejoice I loved his
[2:01:08] appearing the scribes and Pharisees
[2:01:10] didn't love his appearing they didn't
[2:01:12] love his coming
[2:01:13] they hated it you know when he came this
[2:01:16] sends actually were exposed amen but
[2:01:19] those who loved him
[2:01:21] were part of him they loved his coming
[2:01:24] they loved his appearance the woman of
[2:01:26] the world brother Roman says and I'll
[2:01:27] close with this the woman at the well
[2:01:29] brother Brahim said she had
[2:01:32] representation in heaven so when the
[2:01:35] Messiah came and spoke to her that
[2:01:37] brought her to life first she had
[2:01:38] representation in heaven the scribes and
[2:01:41] Pharisees all they had was their own
[2:01:43] human religious righteousness so when
[2:01:46] the light came and spoke to them it just
[2:01:47] black them out because they had no
[2:01:49] representation in heaven he speaks about
[2:01:51] in future home he said that one amen but
[2:01:55] you see her response to the word in her
[2:01:57] day showed she had representation in
[2:02:00] heaven how lujah that's the same thing
[2:02:02] with us hallelujah amen
[2:02:05] yes that's why we are the way we are
[2:02:06] because we have representation in heaven
[2:02:09] hallelujah and you can't change that
[2:02:11] representation it's either there or it's
[2:02:13] not and the reason we love is appearing
[2:02:15] we love and manifesting himself we love
[2:02:17] is coming we love his word that's
[2:02:18] because we have representation and
[2:02:21] heaven hallelujah glory we should be the
[2:02:25] most happiest people in all the world
[2:02:27] hallelujah and not because we just feel
[2:02:30] it the reason we feel it is because it's
[2:02:32] a reality we believe it so but the devil
[2:02:35] will come you walk out these doors
[2:02:37] come come Wednesday midday
[2:02:41] there'll be now a battle yo really a
[2:02:45] might you know I don't feel happy
