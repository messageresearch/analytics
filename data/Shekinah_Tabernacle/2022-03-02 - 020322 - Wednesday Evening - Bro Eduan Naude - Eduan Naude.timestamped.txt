[9:23] into the presence of god we always come
[9:24] back

[9:30] the lord is always positive and his
[9:32] life is positive you know life life
[9:34] grows that
[9:35] it's not much then it becomes something
[9:37] more that's the nature of life you know
[9:38] and that's
[9:40] um
[9:41] when we approach the author of life then
[9:42] that's what happens it doesn't matter

[36:35] what i want to come tonight with is um
[36:40] sorry
[36:42] thank you lord
[36:47] we've been in so many times in
[36:48] situations
[36:50] where
[36:52] i come from a south african background
[36:55] and
[36:57] even in the third world we haven't
[36:58] experienced war we haven't experienced
[37:01] anything that
[37:03] except the lion that chases after us
[37:06] and um
[37:09] but it was always fight or flight it was
[37:11] always
[37:13] it was always
[37:16] um
[37:17] protection
[37:18] it was always
[37:21] run as fast as you can it was always
[37:24] look behind you
[37:25] it was always
[37:27] put your hand back under the seat lock
[37:29] the doors
[37:31] have
[37:32] something in
[37:33] in front of your window so that no one
[37:35] can come in
[37:36] and ironically so that we can't escape
[37:40] what we talked about the other day
[37:42] toilet truly doors or what was it called
[37:44] maxi doors or something within the
[37:46] hallway within the bedrooms and
[37:48] everything to protect yourself and it
[37:50] was always a fight or flight
[37:54] and
[37:55] through the culture
[37:56] and didn't matter what color you were
[38:00] you you had to protect you had to you
[38:02] had to fight we had to flight
[38:05] and um
[38:07] here we are tonight
[38:10] in a country
[38:12] that's actually peaceful and a country
[38:14] that's got security
[38:16] and and and often offer so much to us
[38:21] um
[38:22] with that in mind
[38:24] um
[38:25] when we were in in our previous country
[38:28] we had to identify with something with
[38:30] you know we we had an identity we had a
[38:35] hardness we had a
[38:37] pride we had
[38:39] something we had to identify with
[38:40] something we had an identity
[38:43] praise the lord and i came here
[38:45] i could throw all that away
[38:48] and i could start new
[38:50] with a new identity
[38:54] i want to read a scripture to you
[38:57] sister talia you can throw it up there
[38:59] please it's one chronicles
[39:01] one chronicles four and if you want to
[39:03] stand and read with me that will be nice
[39:06] i would um

[39:10] i think initially i had three verses
[39:12] i'll just read these two so one
[39:13] chronicles 4
[39:15] verse 9 and 10.
[39:24] do you love the lord tonight
[39:33] one chronicles four
[39:36] you can put that up
[39:40] you've got it
[39:44] here we go
[39:46] aniabas yabis was more honorable
[39:49] than his brethren
[39:51] and his mother called him yabba saying
[39:53] because i bear him with sorrow and yah
[39:56] was called on the god of israel
[39:59] it's very important he called on the god
[40:01] of israel
[40:02] saying on
[40:04] oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed
[40:07] and enlarge my coast
[40:09] and that thine hand
[40:11] might be with me
[40:13] and that thou would has keep me from
[40:15] evil
[40:16] that it may not grieve me
[40:19] and god granted him that which he
[40:22] requested
[40:26] john 14 john 14 verse 12
[40:30] john 14 verse 12
[40:32] very familiar
[40:34] very very verily i say unto you he that
[40:37] believeth on me
[40:39] the works that i do shall he do also and
[40:43] greater works than these
[40:45] shall he do or she do
[40:48] because i go unto my father we all go
[40:52] unto
[40:53] our father
[40:55] may god bless the reading of his word
[40:58] you may be seated
[41:00] i've got one little scripture right at
[41:02] the end that we can
[41:04] we can throw it it will be one of the um
[41:06] [Music]
[41:08] one of the uh slides there i've got two
[41:10] slides there
[41:11] um and maybe just
[41:14] maybe we should just get into that i
[41:16] would i would um
[41:18] i would
[41:19] encourage you tonight
[41:22] and this is something i've i've picked
[41:24] up in a sermon one day or sitting here
[41:26] and again
[41:28] this is all to do with identity please
[41:30] look through the lens of identity
[41:33] where are you now
[41:34] i remember the last time i had this
[41:37] funny little title called do you look
[41:40] where are you looking to
[41:43] that could define who are you
[41:46] don't be you
[41:49] be him
[41:51] but
[41:52] there's the but
[41:53] when you realize who you are and now i'm
[41:57] talking in christ
[42:00] then
[42:01] you can be you
[42:03] because of him
[42:08] the lord gave that to me i don't know i
[42:09] don't even have a date i don't know when
[42:12] and it struck me because
[42:16] because because
[42:18] with my background
[42:19] denominational background and um it was
[42:23] always again i'm i'm talking about this
[42:25] fight or flight it was always a
[42:29] a fight who is right who's reading his
[42:31] bible the most who understands and
[42:33] interpret it the right way in the
[42:35] correct way and with that
[42:39] you wanted to
[42:40] you wanted to be him
[42:42] but you haven't identified who you are
[42:46] i don't know if it makes sense
[42:48] don't be you
[42:50] when
[42:51] when you are
[42:53] when you are not you don't be you
[42:55] but be him
[42:57] okay
[42:59] when you understand that when you are
[43:01] your identity is in him
[43:06] then realize
[43:08] who you are
[43:10] then
[43:11] be you
[43:13] okay
[43:14] because then you can step back and say i
[43:16] am who i am because of him
[43:20] hopefully that makes sense
[43:24] leave yourself behind leave everything
[43:26] behind
[43:27] nothing
[43:28] matters on this
[43:30] earth
[43:31] and our surroundings and our
[43:33] circumstances but him
[43:36] and if you can place him
[43:37] on a pedestal somewhere huge in your
[43:40] heart
[43:42] make room for him whatever you do
[43:45] so that you can realize then
[43:48] who you are
[43:50] and he can be
[43:52] he can be himself through you
[43:55] and as ironic and how's how how how
[43:59] in afrikaans we say dear macar how
[44:01] confusing that sounds
[44:03] that's when you find yourself and that's
[44:05] when you know
[44:06] that you know
[44:08] that you can be
[44:10] running for shelter
[44:12] you can be trying to keep away from a
[44:14] from a protest or some sort of silly
[44:17] virus
[44:18] doesn't matter you know who you are and
[44:21] we've got that song
[44:23] that we so
[44:24] so love to hear and love to sing along
[44:26] with this you i know who i am
[44:30] so maybe we can do that later on
[44:35] can i um
[44:37] i think this slide was identification
[44:40] says natalia yes oh can you read there
[44:43] oh that's good
[44:46] i'll read that for you
[44:48] and that's about four or so
[44:51] uh sermons ago that brother ben posted
[44:54] um moses had to stoop from a throne to
[44:57] take the word of god he forsook a throne
[45:01] that's right he was the head here to the
[45:03] throne
[45:04] and he forsook the pleasures of being
[45:06] pharaoh
[45:07] for he esteemed the reproach of christ
[45:09] greater riches than the treasures of
[45:13] egypt
[45:16] moses had
[45:18] had the right to the pharaoh throne he
[45:22] was educated in that way
[45:25] and i don't know how many times how
[45:27] regularly but i can just picture myself
[45:30] like brother
[45:31] ferdi did it so nicely when he he
[45:33] described our
[45:34] our king sitting and fishing for us it
[45:36] was beautiful to see and it was it was
[45:38] really um i thought um sincere and and
[45:42] and meant in a really good way and this
[45:44] is i think
[45:46] moses mother came to him and tap him on
[45:48] the shoulder and reminded him who he was
[45:52] who he is
[45:53] and who he needs to be
[45:56] for a people and for the king
[45:58] to be
[45:59] uh to be the one that would lead
[46:01] out of egypt now if you look in the
[46:03] natural way he was standing within the
[46:05] palace
[46:06] with um people around him that will that
[46:09] will dress him and that will you know
[46:11] provide to him whatever with a click of
[46:13] a finger
[46:15] his mother would come and tap him on the
[46:16] shoulder and say remember who you are
[46:20] you say well i tell you the woman will
[46:23] will all laugh at me the men i think i
[46:25] don't care what they think that's right
[46:27] i hope that sinks in with you tonight
[46:30] don't care what they think
[46:32] paul stooped now paul when he was sold
[46:35] moses stooped from a throne i got a line
[46:37] of wrote drove down here about three
[46:39] pages now let me tell you something
[46:41] right quick jesus stooped from heaven
[46:44] to reflect himself in the in the form of
[46:47] sinful flesh
[46:49] and who are you
[46:51] or who
[46:52] am i
[46:53] to make to make a way for us to reflect
[46:56] god to make a way to reflect himself in
[47:00] us
[47:01] by sanctifiers to his word
[47:04] for his word says that when he did so
[47:07] so that we could reflect his word
[47:12] so that we could reflect his word
[47:15] coming back to my little theme there of
[47:20] stand aside when you don't know yet who
[47:22] you are
[47:23] and let him be him let him work let him
[47:26] change let him uh there's a beautiful
[47:29] skit in one day if the lord tarries
[47:32] which i hope he doesn't
[47:34] um
[47:37] and and brother armand um agrees we can
[47:39] do a little skit um called
[47:41] uh god's chisel
[47:44] god's chisel and and the guy stands and
[47:46] he's chiseling away
[47:48] um
[47:49] he's representing god and and this guy
[47:51] said yes yeah i'm i'm ready and he sucks
[47:54] himself up and he motivates himself look
[47:56] it's still self is still here it's still
[47:59] i'm i'm me
[48:01] i want to be him but i'm i'm me
[48:04] and every time god gets out the chisel
[48:07] and he knocks ah it's so it's all maybe
[48:10] maybe try left try the left side any oh
[48:12] no no no that's that's aina that's ouch
[48:14] um um
[48:16] can i not um
[48:18] try my tribal racial and and they knocks
[48:20] and it's sore and it's ouch and he
[48:22] doesn't know
[48:23] any anywhere it's gonna hurt
[48:26] anywhere it's gonna hurt
[48:28] your character
[48:30] is
[48:32] needs to be
[48:33] needs to be chiseled
[48:35] and if you if you take a little wooden
[48:37] block or something you start to chisel
[48:39] doesn't matter which side you start
[48:41] there's chips that will fall away
[48:43] there's chips
[48:45] large small and one day it'll feel
[48:47] better the one day it won't
[48:49] um there's big chips and small chips
[48:52] that need to get off
[48:53] and that god's chisel
[48:55] is is so needed in each in our life
[49:00] to
[49:02] to be you
[49:04] because of him
[49:07] i actually don't know where i'm going
[49:09] with this
[49:14] realize who you are
[49:17] realize that the world around us is
[49:19] quite real
[49:21] where we um
[49:24] so i'm just seeing that scripture have i
[49:26] read everything there 244
[49:29] oh that's right i wanted to end
[49:31] that's right sorry that was not in my
[49:33] notes
[49:34] the last one then you are identified
[49:37] somewhere in the scripture
[49:39] so if any will follow me let him deny
[49:42] himself let him deny his man-made creed
[49:46] pick up his bible pick up your
[49:49] you know
[49:50] and follow me
[49:52] that's right so then you are identified
[49:55] somewhere in the scripture
[49:57] sorry i had to hurry and get all my
[49:59] notes here in one place and i read that
[50:02] and i thought i cannot leave that out
[50:04] that is that is the crux and i left it
[50:06] out of my notes
[50:08] find yourself in the scripture find
[50:10] yourself where are we
[50:12] um
[50:14] i've been i've been finding myself in in
[50:16] numbers the blessing
[50:18] um
[50:19] i've been finding myself where
[50:22] where um
[50:24] oh
[50:24] me and sister lundy went for a walk who
[50:26] was that samuel it was one of the
[50:28] prophets
[50:29] and uh hopefully one day i'll share
[50:31] about that where
[50:34] where
[50:34] the lord said don't mess with the
[50:36] prophet
[50:37] don't mess with him
[50:39] don't reject him don't don't
[50:41] in in the wilding term dissim
[50:44] um
[50:45] they would they would you you he he is
[50:48] it he
[50:49] not slay
[50:50] but hugh
[50:53] hoe down however uh yeah
[50:56] um
[50:57] they will hack you
[50:58] basically is what the scripture says
[51:01] be very careful
[51:03] if the prophet comes over your way
[51:05] and he speaks something to you that is
[51:08] maybe not contrary to
[51:11] to what this guy
[51:13] it's uncomfortable what i'm hearing what
[51:16] i need to do
[51:18] be
[51:19] yourself
[51:20] in him let everything go
[51:24] let him bold let him rebuild
[51:26] you still have time
[51:30] can we um
[51:32] i'm gonna share that um so that's the
[51:34] the blessing um slide
[51:37] um
[51:38] you probably saw now that i was
[51:40] yeah sorry it's a bit small as well
[51:43] i've got a few different languages up
[51:45] there of number six
[51:48] very nice song that we that we sing
[51:51] um
[51:52] very nice song that
[51:54] that the world is singing singing as
[51:57] well denominational churches um is where
[52:00] you came from um i tell brother ben
[52:04] regularly that they are writing those
[52:06] songs and they don't even know they're
[52:07] writing it for us
[52:08] it's for us here to sing right now
[52:11] because we can identify and we've got a
[52:13] true identity and we can point to christ
[52:15] and we can say
[52:16] our all in all our all in all i
[52:19] believe the revealed open word
[52:22] in every tottenham
[52:24] um
[52:25] of that
[52:27] so
[52:30] i'll read it for you and i wanted to
[52:31] read that in
[52:33] in my native tongue
[52:35] i listen to the song and that's that's
[52:37] sort of the inspiration for this i
[52:38] listen to the to the maori to the um
[52:41] sort of a new zealand version of the
[52:43] song
[52:44] which a lot of churches sung together
[52:46] and there's one piece and right at the
[52:48] end where um when someone is reading um
[52:52] basically this as well
[52:54] and it and it really hit me and i said
[52:57] with with every nation every tribe every
[53:00] tongue
[53:02] may we
[53:04] may we give what we have
[53:06] may we may we with the identity that we
[53:09] have in us in christ
[53:12] may we be able to tell this to someone
[53:15] out there
[53:16] um and i'm thinking of and i'm thinking
[53:18] of russians and ukrainians
[53:21] may may we
[53:22] may we be able to pray for them
[53:25] and and and and proclaim this to them
[53:29] so i will read
[53:31] and as i read um you can just go to the
[53:34] next verses talia i don't have that
[53:36] little thingy at the front clicker
[53:39] the eraser you see
[53:43] the lord bless thee and keep thee in
[53:45] verse 25
[53:52] the lord make his face shine upon me and
[53:55] be gracious unto thee
[54:02] the lord lift up his countenance be
[54:05] upon thee
[54:07] and give thee peace
[54:09] and this is so nice for me
[54:15] from israel
[54:17] and acts
[54:19] and i shall put my name upon the
[54:22] children of israel and i will bless them
[54:27] it um
[54:29] it yeah so sister tabu has done a little
[54:31] recording and hopefully we can share
[54:33] that with the um
[54:35] with a wider audience and with the
[54:37] church as well
[54:38] of the blessing
[54:40] and it's um
[54:41] it's really powerful and i think with
[54:43] the times that we're going through now
[54:47] may i say this you can only read this
[54:50] if you know who you are who you are
[54:54] don't don't read this
[54:56] if it's still you
[54:58] read this emphasis if it's him through
[55:00] you
[55:02] then you will understand and then you
[55:04] will
[55:05] you will you will
[55:08] i think you will receive revelation
[55:10] of the of the importance of why we read
[55:13] this why did i read yah basically
[55:15] obviously some
[55:17] prayer
[55:18] is he understood
[55:22] who he was
[55:26] yahweh called on the god of israel
[55:28] saying oh that thou would has blessed me
[55:31] indeed
[55:32] and enlarged my coast because at the
[55:34] front he was the honorable man
[55:37] more honorable than his brothers
[55:40] so he
[55:41] he knew that
[55:43] now that's confidence this is not
[55:45] cockiness
[55:46] that is go i want to increase my my land
[55:49] my coast
[55:51] and see this with your spiritual lens
[55:54] with identity that you have in christ
[55:57] increase
[55:58] my coast increase my spiritual increase
[56:01] the the the
[56:04] the what do you call it
[56:07] my exposure
[56:09] to
[56:10] to over the waters over the peoples
[56:13] uh increase my
[56:15] my my revelation that i can receive
[56:18] through your word so that i can speak
[56:20] and go out and say to people that do not
[56:22] know you
[56:24] that's why i read john
[56:25] because verily verily i say unto you he
[56:28] that believeth on me and the works that
[56:31] i do
[56:32] greater works than than these shall ye
[56:36] you do
[56:37] me do you do everyone here
[56:40] those that's watching as well
[56:42] greater works you will do we are christ
[56:45] right now it's come over the pulpit so
[56:47] many times
[56:48] receive that identity know who you are
[56:58] we've got liz um
[57:00] this prayer request um
[57:03] yeah so may we start with
[57:07] i i will just start with um with with
[57:09] ukraine
[57:10] because um we've we have received some
[57:13] some testimonies from the and it has
[57:15] really spoken to me in my heart it could
[57:18] be because of my culture where i come
[57:20] from my previous identity like i
[57:22] mentioned now to you
[57:23] um
[57:24] but these people are it's it's it's real
[57:28] and on my way here on sunday
[57:31] um
[57:32] i
[57:33] i lay i felt flat i felt um
[57:38] i felt sad for the people
[57:40] and and and me and this is why i'm
[57:42] saying
[57:43] if if you're this guy
[57:45] but not yet through him
[57:48] um you'll you'll feel sad you'll feel
[57:51] sorry for people you feel
[57:53] you know um
[57:54] lord i read in your word it needs to
[57:56] come to fruition it it's been prophesied
[57:58] it will come
[58:00] so
[58:00] and that's the complicity of a christian
[58:03] heart is looking at at that from a
[58:06] excited point of view and looking that
[58:08] from a sad point of view but then
[58:11] this guy
[58:12] received one of the testimonies and
[58:14] received one of the
[58:15] the things and i can't remember i
[58:17] probably won't mention the brother's
[58:19] name
[58:21] that testified how the lord is
[58:23] protecting them within that time
[58:26] so now all of a sudden through him
[58:29] i identified with that
[58:31] people
[58:32] and
[58:33] and the lord just said
[58:35] and and that's why i wanted to sing
[58:36] tonight i was supposed to sing as well
[58:38] but thank you brother isaac helping me
[58:40] out um i love this family of god i
[58:43] wanted to sing that for them as well i
[58:45] love this family and all of a sudden it
[58:47] struck me last sunday
[58:49] when i read that testimony that's my
[58:51] family as well and i love them as well i
[58:54] can't even pronounce their names that
[58:56] doesn't matter because it's now that's
[58:58] connected to an earthly vessel but
[59:00] before the foundations of the earth and
[59:02] thank you brother ferdie we had a good
[59:03] chat and a and a bit of a chew on the
[59:06] fat after his sermon is like that
[59:09] representation of the
[59:11] of the idea that god had in his mind
[59:14] before the foundation of world of you
[59:16] he had that identity of you already
[59:19] we we weren't necessarily created
[59:22] we were already a thought
[59:25] that
[59:27] them as well
[59:28] they were the thought
[59:30] they were there with me before the
[59:32] foundation they and and we together
[59:35] loved each other so
[59:38] that struck me then all of a sudden
[59:41] now you could see me as a hypocrite then
[59:43] if i if i felt sad and i prayed for them
[59:47] and now all of a sudden it hit home
[59:50] that
[59:51] with all that mess there's still one
[59:54] that standing still one that's walking
[59:58] still one that's keeping all his
[1:00:01] his um
[1:00:03] his eggs in the heavenly basket if i can
[1:00:05] say that
[1:00:06] he is
[1:00:07] he's identified with christ
[1:00:09] he or she is sold out
[1:00:12] and they give their lives to them
[1:00:14] doesn't matter if
[1:00:16] if they are under attack doesn't matter
[1:00:18] if they sitting in peace and serenity
[1:00:21] they
[1:00:22] have found their true identity
[1:00:25] i'm sorry that
[1:00:27] if that um
[1:00:29] was all over the show
[1:00:31] um i just felt
[1:00:33] that's what the what the lord wanted to
[1:00:36] show me and i was trying to sort of
[1:00:38] relay that back to you you know i'm not
[1:00:40] not in any way a good preacher
[1:00:44] but praise the lord we are here
[1:00:47] and we still keep on walking um a couple
[1:00:49] of prayer requests i i would probably
[1:00:52] request if if i read these out and we
[1:00:54] start praying that we maybe create that
[1:00:56] atmosphere again and we can we can we
[1:00:58] can sing and we can worship um
[1:01:01] while we pray as well and i really want
[1:01:03] any everyone to sincerely pray and have
[1:01:07] have your needs in front of the king
[1:01:09] so that he can he can hear you speak
[1:01:11] that
[1:01:14] and by all means speak to the devil as
[1:01:16] well
[1:01:17] don't waste your time just tell him
[1:01:18] where he needs to go
[1:01:20] where he comes from
[1:01:22] and that he doesn't even have the keys
[1:01:24] of his own house
[1:01:26] a couple of prayer requests from brother
[1:01:28] imos and rabul
[1:01:30] papua new guinea sister sarah marum
[1:01:33] who is an old sister there is quite
[1:01:35] unwell
[1:01:36] they are also in a land dispute with the
[1:01:38] owners of the land that is right next to
[1:01:41] the church which could make it a problem
[1:01:43] for them to have church there
[1:01:46] now
[1:01:47] when i was reading this
[1:01:49] briefly this afternoon i was trying to
[1:01:52] think
[1:01:52] with every every situation and every
[1:01:55] prayer request that we receive
[1:01:57] we've got a testimony
[1:01:59] so
[1:02:00] this own little church we we had a
[1:02:03] spiritual land dispute here at one stage
[1:02:06] where the gangsters was next door and we
[1:02:09] were
[1:02:10] we were feeling unsafe i would say if we
[1:02:12] if we were in the flesh
[1:02:14] but we just said
[1:02:17] no more
[1:02:19] this is the lord's work this is what the
[1:02:21] lord's given us
[1:02:23] we've got so many testimonies of how
[1:02:25] he's real in this congregation
[1:02:30] we don't have to move
[1:02:32] they need to move
[1:02:34] no no no gangsters next door so i'll
[1:02:36] just leave it at that
[1:02:38] how many times have we read so we've got
[1:02:40] um
[1:02:41] jason's wife danae
[1:02:43] he accompanied her to um
[1:02:46] to hospital today for the test of breast
[1:02:48] cancer
[1:02:51] we've got a testimony we've got
[1:02:52] testimonies
[1:02:54] of healing in this church
[1:02:55] of people that had
[1:02:57] cancer and don't have cancer no more
[1:03:02] and we we hear that
[1:03:05] we hear that almost i would say on a
[1:03:08] weekly basis
[1:03:09] if we start listening to the churches
[1:03:11] all across the globe
[1:03:13] how many times is there people coming
[1:03:15] forward and say
[1:03:17] the lord's miraculously healed me
[1:03:20] and that's when when doctors even gave
[1:03:22] give up
[1:03:23] please make that real in your own life
[1:03:25] pray for the mashable family in south
[1:03:27] africa he was a pastor in hotel and was
[1:03:30] murdered and his house ransacked
[1:03:34] and that
[1:03:37] that that is the fight or flight that
[1:03:39] i'm that
[1:03:40] i was talking about and referring to is
[1:03:47] that that that must be in the word
[1:03:50] in the will of the lord as well
[1:03:53] and we don't know always the answers we
[1:03:56] don't know

[1:04:11] we know that they've
[1:04:12] they've got the overcoming power and
[1:04:14] they're sitting in a an absolutely
[1:04:16] better space than we are currently
[1:04:18] may that be real to us maybe

[1:04:40] my hand
[1:04:42] and let my hand go
[1:04:44] how many times have i stopped stopped my
[1:04:46] walk
[1:04:47] law to to go a different way and where i
[1:04:50] wanted to leave your hand
[1:04:52] where i wanted to get my hand away from
[1:04:55] you
[1:04:56] just as a little one sometimes want to

[1:05:07] safety
[1:05:08] lord how many times that
[1:05:10] uh we wanted to just rip our hand away

[1:05:37] liberty that i have within you
[1:05:39] lord the the identity identity
