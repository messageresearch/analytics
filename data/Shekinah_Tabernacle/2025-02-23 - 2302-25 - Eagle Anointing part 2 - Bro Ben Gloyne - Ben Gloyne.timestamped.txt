[29:28] just start playing the song this is just
[29:30] a
[29:31] um just a new song we're going to sing
[29:34] this morning some of you may not um you
[29:35] can just start playing the
[29:36] intro and um I just I just love to
[29:39] Worship the Lord sometimes you know
[29:40] sometimes we get into situations I
[29:42] remember one time I was when I was
[29:45] running a little church in
[29:46] Gisborne felt like the Lord said to do
[29:48] it and the Lord opened up things and
[29:50] then some older brothers this may not
[29:53] mean something to some people but some
[29:54] older older brothers that were older
[29:56] than me they were these guys hadn't gone
[29:58] to church for about 20 years but they
[30:00] sort of seemed to think they knew
[30:01] everything about how churches should
[30:02] work in that but they just sort of
[30:03] stayed home didn't go anywhere but they
[30:06] they kind of came along for a bit and
[30:07] then they sort of teamed up together to
[30:09] kind of gang up on me in a way I suppose
[30:11] and they started saying you know the
[30:12] Lord's given me all these things in the
[30:14] 3:00 in the morning and telling me to
[30:16] tell you you're wrong and all these
[30:17] things you need to stop and all this
[30:19] sort of stuff you know when you're quite
[30:20] young it's quite hard to take you know
[30:21] it's intense on you they they're
[30:23] basically preaching hell far over and
[30:24] you're saying if you don't repent stop
[30:25] this you're going to be going it's all
[30:27] over for you and this is your last
[30:29] chance and everything and you know I
[30:31] didn't really feel right about it
[30:32] because I'm like looking at them
[30:33] thinking these guys don't go anywhere
[30:35] they don't do anything and they can walk
[30:37] out of the come out of the you know
[30:38] closet and you know it it doesn't quite
[30:40] work like that but it was very hard to
[30:42] take I almost went a couple of times my
[30:44] life were almost gone insane and that
[30:46] was one of them I just was too much
[30:47] sometimes to it just almost went pop you
[30:49] know between this world and some but you
[30:52] know in those times you just find you
[30:55] can just Worship the Lord I just think
[30:56] Lord when it all gets too much Lord I
[30:57] just worship
[30:59] I just want to worship Lord and
[31:01] and you know what I did I actually went
[31:03] out for a trap
[31:05] fish I went out way up in the country
[31:07] there and I went to this new river that
[31:09] I'd never been to before fishing in it
[31:11] anyway I had the most amazing trout fish
[31:13] you ever had man there was trout
[31:14] everywhere I was pulling them up one
[31:17] after the other and I was just rejoicing
[31:19] because the Lord knows I love Trap
[31:20] Fishing I was just pulling these trout
[31:22] up like you wouldn't believe in you know
[31:24] but at the same time I was just
[31:25] worshiping Lord I'm just going to
[31:26] worship I don't know I can't make sense
[31:27] of all this Lord and but I'm just going
[31:29] to worship today Lord I'm just going to
[31:31] worship Lord because you know it starts
[31:32] over here it ends up here and all the
[31:34] stuff in here doesn't matter you know we
[31:36] get to situations where sometimes things
[31:37] don't make logical sense it's just it's
[31:40] just intense it's precious it's all this
[31:41] stuff it's just like you know but we can
[31:44] just sometimes you just it starts here
[31:45] it ends up over there all the stuff in
[31:48] here when it all gets too much just
[31:49] worship Lord I just worship you this
[31:52] morning Lord and that's we're just going
[31:53] to I Just Want To Worship we'll just
[31:55] Worship the Lord this morning and I
[31:57] don't know I can get the song out cuz

[46:26] we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen
[46:30] amen God bless you friends you can have
[46:31] your seats this morning so I want to
[46:33] continue um I want to continue uh from
[46:37] last Sunday Kind of about about the
[46:40] eagle anointing and especially about how
[46:43] he causes us to see where we're going
[46:45] now if you know where you're going it
[46:47] changes everything right I know like you
[46:51] think of a destination school there's
[46:54] not a lot of Joy a lot of people when
[46:56] you know you're going to
[46:57] school if you go to school you can say
[46:59] amen I see some some head shaking like
[47:01] yeah I agree right if you're going on
[47:03] holiday that changes your whole outlook
[47:06] right I'm just I just want you to think
[47:07] about this when you think about where
[47:08] you're going right and the more you uh
[47:11] the more you're excited about where
[47:13] you're going the more you want to know
[47:14] about that place and then also you want
[47:16] to know how you're going to get there
[47:17] now we we know that our eyes have have
[47:20] come you know I said all that because we
[47:23] realize we know where we're going right
[47:25] we're not guessing we're not we're not
[47:27] imagining that there's maybe a heaven
[47:29] and maybe we're going to get there and
[47:31] maybe it's all going to work out fine we
[47:33] know amen because the great builder of
[47:35] that City the great maker of of of of
[47:38] Heaven and Earth has come down
[47:40] personally and told you where you're
[47:43] going now I think I think as the Bride
[47:45] of the you know bride of Jesus Christ I
[47:47] think we should encourage ourselves
[47:49] knowing where we're going right because
[47:51] if we can look at our destination it
[47:53] doesn't matter the journey the journey
[47:55] is for a purpose amen that we end up in
[47:57] that City to to develop our character to
[48:00] mold us and shape us so you know the
[48:02] journey uh some people say the
[48:04] destination is the journey I said no
[48:06] that's not it no the destination is the
[48:07] destination we're just passing through a
[48:09] place now God has allowed us to look
[48:12] past a curtain a time you know many
[48:14] times you know we hear like rejected
[48:15] King brother B relates the story of of
[48:18] of how he was laying in bed he was 50
[48:20] odd years old he says you know you he
[48:23] said to himself well if he is ever going
[48:25] to do anything for the Lord he better to
[48:26] do it now he's an old man and then he
[48:28] heard a voice saying would you like to
[48:29] look past the curtain and and that and
[48:32] that and that realm that you know that
[48:34] glorious place was just he said it was
[48:36] just above the door frame it's just
[48:38] there in a higher Dimension it's not
[48:40] somewhere a million billion miles away
[48:42] it's it's just here right that that that
[48:44] great unseen place and before he knew it
[48:46] he was in that place and he was young
[48:48] and it was perfect love and he and he
[48:51] could describe what the people looked
[48:52] like and things but he could never
[48:54] describe how Sublime how great that
[48:56] place was
[48:57] now the prophet was taken beyond the
[48:59] curtain of time to come back and tell us
[49:01] that place is real right but then now
[49:04] that place that great because that is
[49:06] you know you know the Holy Ghost fills
[49:07] that place and then and then the then
[49:10] the spirit of God comes down into this
[49:11] Dimension and touches you and changes
[49:14] you and turns you around and gives you a
[49:17] faith in his word because he's telling
[49:20] you you belong in that
[49:21] land hallelujah amen so so our eyes you
[49:25] our eyes of understanding this is really
[49:27] I wanted just to read Verse 18 but you
[49:29] start reading Ephesians it's hard to
[49:31] where do you get on where do you get off
[49:32] you know because it's such a beautiful
[49:34] beautiful book so that's why we read a
[49:35] whole bunch but you know he says that
[49:37] the eyes of your are understanding being
[49:39] enlightened now this un um this this uh
[49:41] being enlightened means they have come
[49:43] open you're no longer in a dream you're
[49:45] no longer just asleep but you're
[49:47] awakened and and we are we are truly
[49:50] living in a day where people have come
[49:52] awake right you know because even even
[49:55] if you look at you know before you meet
[49:57] the Lord you're actually living asleep
[50:00] and you're asleep walking you know we
[50:02] had one of our daughters I won't name
[50:03] who but there's three some sure you get
[50:05] a 33% chance of guessing but they they
[50:07] fell asleep in their bed and then the
[50:09] next morning they woke up in one of
[50:10] their sister's beds and so they were
[50:13] they they got out of bed they started
[50:16] walking they didn't crash into any doors
[50:18] they opened doors they got up they got
[50:20] into the bed maybe told the sister move
[50:22] over all that while asleep so people can
[50:26] do things and we all I'm sure most of us
[50:28] sleepwalked while we were young yeah I
[50:30] think I did you know but you see um
[50:34] sleepwalking you're actually doing
[50:35] things but you're not conscious of what
[50:37] you're doing and then when she woke up
[50:38] the next morning she's thinking how did
[50:39] I get here right but the light came on
[50:42] right it was no longer night season it
[50:45] became a day there was a Breaking of a
[50:46] day the sun came up and then and then I
[50:49] woke them up out of bed a voice came
[50:51] wake up it's time to get up and she woke
[50:52] up how did I get here and it's many
[50:54] times the same things with our Christian
[50:56] Journey we're actually born asleep and
[50:58] we go through life and we're doing
[51:00] things but then but there comes a day
[51:01] when the Sun rises in our life the s o n
[51:04] Rises and he begins to speak to us we
[51:06] hear his voice and and our eyes come
[51:08] home we think man how did I get here
[51:11] hallelujah but you see he doesn't leave
[51:13] you just with that question he begins to
[51:15] show you this is how you got here and
[51:17] this is where you're going amen you love
[51:19] the Lord to uh uh this morning I'm just
[51:21] going to enjoy myself today you know
[51:23] because our God's great and we can have
[51:25] such confidence of our final destination
[51:29] amen now now Zechariah would say this in
[51:31] Zechariah Chapter chapter 4 here and
[51:33] he'd speaking you know the angel that
[51:35] talked with him uh uh talked with me
[51:37] came again and wed me as a man that is
[51:40] awakened out of out of sleep and so here
[51:43] he was he was then he began to see
[51:46] things that he wasn't you know cuz when
[51:48] you're asleep things can happen around
[51:49] you some people can sleep very deep you
[51:51] people can come and turn on lights
[51:53] rearrange things and you know turn off
[51:55] the light walk out and that person can
[51:56] not conscious of anything that's taking
[51:58] place but so but when you're awaken you
[52:00] can realize what you're even you know
[52:02] what's even around you and this is what
[52:03] the Lord has done he he said he said
[52:05] unto me what see it thou I said I have
[52:07] looked and behold a Candlestick all of
[52:08] gold with a bowl the top of it and the
[52:10] Seven lamps there on and seven pipes to
[52:12] the seven lamps which are upon the top
[52:14] thereof and the two olive trees by it
[52:17] one upon the right side of the bowl and
[52:19] the other upon the left side thereof so
[52:21] he's beginning to see the seven Church
[52:22] ages beginning to see where he is in
[52:24] time but then there came a then there
[52:26] came a question now where he says he
[52:29] says what are these um and and so I
[52:32] answered and and and I spoke to the
[52:34] angel that talked with me saying what
[52:36] are these my Lord so sometimes we can
[52:38] see things we don't understand what they
[52:40] are but the message of the hours open
[52:42] our eyes so we can see what what the
[52:44] word says we're going to go a bit faster
[52:46] eventually okay I just want to lay these
[52:47] things because if you could realize God
[52:50] has anchored in your soul you have a
[52:52] place at the wedding supper table God
[52:54] has anchored that and he's revealed it
[52:57] and he ain't going to change his mind he
[52:59] never changes his mind he he he ordained
[53:01] your position there before the
[53:03] foundation of the world right and he
[53:05] doesn't change his mind about that
[53:07] nothing you can do it see if you're an
[53:09] elected Gene seed of God nothing you can
[53:11] do upon this Earth can disqualify your
[53:14] place at the table I know that may be
[53:16] very strong but if God has predestinated
[53:19] you there amen then you're going to end
[53:21] there sure you'll end up with different
[53:22] rewards and things the things you do in
[53:24] this life but you will end up there
[53:26] right because you're part of him I mean
[53:28] so if that's the case all fear should
[53:31] leave I mean what do we got to worry
[53:34] about honestly what do we got to fear if
[53:37] our lord Jesus Tri Christ took our full
[53:40] punishment that we should have received
[53:42] he took the wrath of God upon himself
[53:43] that day on Calvary the Judgment we
[53:46] should have received he took upon
[53:47] himself for you and I the sin question
[53:50] settled amen it's all done what do we
[53:52] have to fear why do we hold back why
[53:55] don't we just let God use us like never
[53:56] before I mean cuz if God has ordained
[53:58] that we're going to be there I say let's
[54:00] press the battle let's not pull back and
[54:02] say well what if I fail well brother
[54:04] brah said I'd rather be on the
[54:05] battlefield trying to win souls for
[54:07] Christ than do nothing he says what are
[54:09] you doing about it am mean so sure I
[54:11] think we should preach the battle I
[54:13] think we should be
[54:14] bold in our walk I'm a Christian this is
[54:17] what I do you know okay this will go on
[54:20] the internet but you know
[54:22] we we we my wife knows where I'm going
[54:25] here we we went walking along the
[54:27] Waterfront yesterday beautiful day you
[54:29] can't beat Wellington on a good day

[55:07] this is what they were doing they were
[55:08] part of a club and they had no shame in
[55:10] what they were doing they said this is
[55:12] our heritage this is who we are and my
[55:15] dad always makes a joke about moris

[55:18] it in the flesh and hey people be y you
[55:21] do you you're right but I'm glad I'm I'm
[55:24] glad I'm not a moris dancer but you see
[55:26] if they could if they anyway I I better
[55:29] quit but you know if they could do that
[55:32] with all seriousness and enjoy what
[55:33] they're doing and it's a silly folk folk
[55:36] dance from from England that looks
[55:39] ridiculous in my eyes Apex of their
[55:42] culture maybe I don't know but you know
[55:44] if they can do that with all serious
[55:45] just not ashamed how much more the Bride
[55:47] of Jesus Christ I mean arrayed in the
[55:50] whiteness of his righteousness amen
[55:52] filled with his Spirit walking according
[55:54] to his word how much more can we just go
[55:56] and and and be us in this
[55:59] world if they can do that and
[56:02] you this is eternal moris dancing ain't
[56:05] Eternal sorry I maybe get some thumbs
[56:07] down on that but you know on the YouTube
[56:09] but anyway you know if they can do that
[56:12] and not be ashamed of what they're doing
[56:14] how about you and I how about you and I
[56:18] amen because we know where we're going I
[56:20] don't know why I had to put that in but
[56:21] you know anyway let's just leave that
[56:23] alone but you see now he would say here
[56:26] he say what are these Lord then the
[56:27] angel talk to them saying and said unto
[56:29] me knowest thou not what these be I said
[56:31] no my Lord then he answered and spake
[56:32] unto me saying this is the word of the
[56:34] Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might
[56:36] nor by power but by my spirit sayith the
[56:38] Lord of hosts who art thou oh great
[56:40] Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt
[56:42] become a plain and he shall bring forth
[56:44] The Headstone thereof with the shoutings
[56:46] crying Grace Grace unto it so here is
[56:48] this man zerubabel and zerubabel
[56:50] actually means to come out of Babylon
[56:52] means to be a descendant of Babel we we
[56:54] know historically they came out of
[56:55] Babylon to rebuild the Temple but his
[56:57] name was I've come out of confusion
[57:00] right but God wanted to show him that
[57:02] may be how you've been named but this is
[57:04] not what you're meant to be you're meant
[57:05] to be the high priest this is what I've
[57:06] ordained you to be and so now when the
[57:08] Lord awakened um Zachariah out of sleep
[57:12] now his eyes came open to see that this
[57:15] great Mountain this great thing
[57:16] withstanding zerubabel coming to his
[57:18] position was going to become a plane and
[57:20] this is what an eagle anointing does
[57:22] Amen it makes something that's there
[57:24] look like it's going to be it's going to
[57:26] be gone who's with them who's with me
[57:29] this morning oh sorry I didn't even have
[57:31] that up forgive me right but you see now
[57:33] you when the eagle anointing comes of
[57:35] his word we begin to see sure there's an
[57:37] obstacle but when you look it through
[57:39] God's eyes that thing is what is that
[57:42] obstacle what is that thing what is that
[57:44] complex what is that unbelief or that
[57:46] hurt or whatever it mean it's going to
[57:48] become a plane that thing that hinders
[57:50] is going to become nothing you're going
[57:51] to walk over there like it's nothing
[57:53] amen and God's going to make it amen he
[57:54] says not by power by might but by my
[57:57] spirit sayith the Lord am mean so people
[57:59] that can see their in destination saying
[58:00] well if God's ordained me at you you at
[58:03] the wedding supper table to go into a
[58:05] Rapture amen then what can hinder me
[58:07] upon this
[58:08] Earth nothing that's the answer amen
[58:11] hallelujah now we understand that God
[58:15] shows
[58:16] us uh he shows us where we're going to
[58:19] end up in his word now now some of you
[58:21] won't remember this but us who were a
[58:25] bit older can remember a lot of us can
[58:28] remember where we were when we heard
[58:30] this happened do you remember where you
[58:31] were when you I remember I was in well
[58:35] it was fifth form back then I don't know
[58:37] what it is year 11 now I guess or
[58:38] something it was morning time this guy
[58:41] aliot Abraham in my dorm was running
[58:43] down the dorm saying they're bombing
[58:45] America and then the news came with this
[58:47] it was on CNN and we watched it the
[58:49] Headmaster gave a speech how the world's
[58:51] going to change and all these things but
[58:53] I remember where I was when this
[58:55] happened right as as brother Arman said
[58:57] on Wednesday a song or a picture like
[59:00] this can take you back in time now God
[59:03] wants to God God puts images in front of
[59:05] us not to take us back in time but to
[59:08] take us forward where we're going to end
[59:10] up right this is this is what the
[59:12] revelation of the word does he puts a
[59:15] God speaks in a story in a parable to
[59:17] open our eyes of understanding
[59:21] now this is Joseph meeting his Brethren
[59:24] now we know in the story before Joseph
[59:26] reveals himself to his brothers everyone
[59:28] has gone from the pal you know he he he
[59:31] tells everyone leave me so now we know
[59:34] Joseph before this happened he married a
[59:36] gentile bride so the Gentile bride where
[59:39] she is while he's revealing himself to
[59:41] the Brethren he's in the pal I mean
[59:42] she's in the palace as as brother bah
[59:45] teaches us now to the eagle now God
[59:48] speaks this picture to you and something
[59:51] in it says you're the bride in the
[59:52] palace amen that that before Jesus ever
[59:56] comes reveals himself to the Jews the
[59:58] Gentile bride is already
[1:00:00] gone hope this is okay this morning but
[1:00:02] God puts a picture before us like you
[1:00:04] know it can just be a sermon you know it
[1:00:06] can be a message you're listening to and
[1:00:08] God opens your eyes of understanding
[1:00:10] saying that is me amen it's like when
[1:00:13] you read the story of Esther and you
[1:00:14] realize I'm not hmon right I'm not even
[1:00:18] Mori there's something in you something
[1:00:20] in the bride of Christ that says you are
[1:00:22] Esther in this day that you've been
[1:00:25] positionally placed in the body of
[1:00:26] Christ to intercede for your family to
[1:00:29] intercede against the enemy Amen to
[1:00:31] actually make your make your claim
[1:00:33] before the Lord Of Glory that his wrath
[1:00:35] can be poured out against your enemy
[1:00:37] amen that we should never be afraid to
[1:00:38] go before our King not one moment amen
[1:00:41] but you see what's happened now is is
[1:00:43] they didn't realize you know his
[1:00:44] brothers did not realize who he was but
[1:00:47] when he spake I am Joseph then their
[1:00:49] eyes came open then I realized really
[1:00:51] where they are standing and and the
[1:00:53] dreams that their naughty little brother
[1:00:54] told them many many years ago has come
[1:00:57] into manifestation now if that can be
[1:00:59] just for a natural family how much more
[1:01:01] the supernatural family of Jesus Christ
[1:01:03] amen that's why this message has come to
[1:01:05] open your eyes of understanding I mean
[1:01:07] you can see I am the bride in the
[1:01:10] picture if you ever want God to work in
[1:01:12] your life start listening to the word
[1:01:15] start feeding on that message start
[1:01:17] listening and God will begin to pour
[1:01:19] Revelation it you will not remain the
[1:01:21] same you cannot remain the same if you
[1:01:23] want to draw closer to God listen to the
[1:01:26] time message read your Bible listen to
[1:01:28] the Bible don't don't don't sit there in
[1:01:30] darkness in a slumber and just go on in
[1:01:33] life God doesn't want you to be asleep
[1:01:35] he wants us to be awakened am mean he
[1:01:37] wants us to be awakened that he can use
[1:01:38] us in in our position he's ordained us
[1:01:41] to be in but you see the thing is we're
[1:01:43] all born with with spiritual Amnesia and
[1:01:46] even you know many times you know God
[1:01:48] can begin to deal with a child but then
[1:01:50] when they begin to hit puberty they go
[1:01:51] through you know teenage years you know
[1:01:53] then then then anamnesia can try and
[1:01:56] come on because innocence is left and
[1:01:59] you know Spirits begin to pull and
[1:02:01] desires come and you know the devil
[1:02:03] wants to pervert those things but you
[1:02:05] see God wants to bring us back to
[1:02:07] familiar places amen and many times
[1:02:10] there's things like you know like this
[1:02:12] story we may never you know I I heard a
[1:02:15] testimony of a brother um I think it's
[1:02:16] Richard Milligan or or Robert Milligan
[1:02:19] can't remember but he is a Pentecostal
[1:02:21] pastor but then he when he read brother
[1:02:23] Braham um um message on Joseph meeting
[1:02:25] his Brethren his eyes came open he was
[1:02:27] the bride in the palace changed his
[1:02:30] whole
[1:02:31] life right so so these things are
[1:02:33] familiar things that that there's part
[1:02:34] of us we already know we're already
[1:02:37] connected with but God has to awaken us
[1:02:40] to realize we're part of it it means
[1:02:42] it's like you know brother BR would tell
[1:02:44] the story in spiritual Amnesia of a I
[1:02:46] think it was World War I after that or
[1:02:47] World War II I can't remember which one
[1:02:49] but there's a whole bunch of soldiers
[1:02:50] that because of shell shock they had you
[1:02:53] know got amnesia they couldn't remember
[1:02:55] who they were then names where they are
[1:02:56] from and you know there's a whole bunch
[1:02:58] of them going in a train they're going
[1:02:59] to a mental institution cuz the Army
[1:03:02] doctors found out they couldn't help the
[1:03:04] couldn't help these men that had been
[1:03:06] Shell Shocked in war they are too many
[1:03:08] explosions had gone off had fried their
[1:03:09] brains and they just didn't know who
[1:03:11] they were and they were and they were
[1:03:12] going on the train they made a stop at a
[1:03:15] um train station and they let these men
[1:03:17] out and then the guards were watching
[1:03:19] them cuz they didn't want them to run
[1:03:20] off and you know just just um maybe
[1:03:22] cause trouble or get lost or whatever
[1:03:25] but but one guard noticed this one man
[1:03:28] he stumbled out like the rest of them
[1:03:29] but but then he began to look around and
[1:03:32] he was looking differently than the rest
[1:03:33] of them and then and then and then he
[1:03:35] began to walk off and another God was
[1:03:37] watching this and and and that God was
[1:03:40] going to grab this man and tell him to
[1:03:41] stop and come back but this other gu
[1:03:43] told him no let's just follow him and
[1:03:45] then so this then this soldier with
[1:03:47] amnesia began to walk and he you walked
[1:03:50] and he looked up he saw a water tank and
[1:03:52] something be to Dawn on him something in
[1:03:54] him knew where he was was mentally he
[1:03:57] didn't know where he was but something
[1:03:58] in him was crying out I've been in this
[1:04:00] place before I've walked this place I've
[1:04:03] seen this train station this water tank
[1:04:05] is familiar to me I've been here I can't
[1:04:08] remember when but something in me says
[1:04:10] this is near home they begins to walk
[1:04:12] down a path walk down another path then
[1:04:14] he comes to a gate of a house and he and
[1:04:16] he and he opens the front gate there's
[1:04:18] an old man standing there on the porch
[1:04:20] and he begins to walk down that walk
[1:04:23] down that path the old man runs down
[1:04:25] andrais and brother say when when his
[1:04:27] father you know that was his father when
[1:04:29] his father embraced him then then
[1:04:30] Amnesia was broken off that Soldier
[1:04:32] because the father said I knew You' come
[1:04:34] home son hallelujah what happened that
[1:04:37] Soldier was brought down familiar places
[1:04:40] it seemed haphazard and random that he
[1:04:42] ended up there but he was ordained to
[1:04:44] walk down that path amen that his eyes
[1:04:46] would come open that he'd remember who
[1:04:48] he was and friends is the same thing
[1:04:50] with this message amen it may seem
[1:04:52] halfhazard or random that it came your
[1:04:54] way maybe think well I'm just born in a
[1:04:56] family that believes that that's just no
[1:04:58] God ordained that you would be here amen
[1:05:00] that you would walk familiar places that
[1:05:03] maybe you say when have I walked this
[1:05:05] before the foundation of the world when
[1:05:06] God thought of you he thought of you as
[1:05:08] part of him part of his word amen and he
[1:05:11] knew he ordained you're going to walk
[1:05:12] this path in this flesh that you would
[1:05:14] know who you
[1:05:16] are amen this is what this word has done
[1:05:19] friends that's why I say we should be
[1:05:21] rugged in our faith we should be bold in
[1:05:23] what we believe amen we should not be
[1:05:25] ashamed amen that I came from God and I
[1:05:28] went back y I'm going back to God Amen
[1:05:30] why cuz God has caused us to walk
[1:05:32] familiar places amen so never ever let
[1:05:36] Amnesia try and strike you again this
[1:05:39] world wants to make you
[1:05:41] asleep sleepwalking but we ain't
[1:05:44] sleepwalking I mean we're marching to
[1:05:46] the beat of the Gospel I mean God has
[1:05:49] called us to walk a predestinated path
[1:05:52] and I tell you friends you may think
[1:05:54] well I only come here cuz I have to do
[1:05:56] let God speak to you one time let God
[1:05:58] deal with you one time open your heart
[1:06:00] to him it'll change your life am mean it
[1:06:02] changed Ezekiel all of his life your
[1:06:05] Camp brother Ben Bailey told him just
[1:06:07] just open your heart he sitting there
[1:06:09] wasn't even happy that he came to camp
[1:06:10] and basically his parents literally
[1:06:12] dragged him there you know but he opened
[1:06:14] his heart to the Lord God began to speak
[1:06:16] to him his eyes came open Hallelujah he
[1:06:19] became a Believer amen why because he
[1:06:21] let himself be impacted by the Eternal
[1:06:25] amen God himself Hallelujah I tell you
[1:06:28] friends it works it worked for me I mean
[1:06:30] I was an Amnesia sleep walking at
[1:06:32] University drinking and party and all
[1:06:34] these things but then one day amen I
[1:06:37] heard this message and God had to deal a
[1:06:39] lot of things but I let him change me
[1:06:42] amen I said Lord take me change my life
[1:06:44] take everything out of me that's
[1:06:45] contrary to your word that you can come
[1:06:47] and dwell in me I tell you friends he
[1:06:49] answered that prayer amen and God still
[1:06:51] changes and
[1:06:52] transforms Hallelujah Jesus amen I'm so
[1:06:56] glad we can do that amen I tell you it
[1:06:59] works and there's keeping power in him
[1:07:02] amen now I just want to draw your
[1:07:04] attention to to to Wednesday night I
[1:07:06] know this wasn't recorded but you know
[1:07:08] at the end of the prayer um brother
[1:07:11] Arman begin to speak about you know if
[1:07:13] you just uh you know he just begin to
[1:07:16] make some comments and I had it in my
[1:07:17] notes uh about this because it wasn't
[1:07:20] brother Arman speaking but the
[1:07:21] atmosphere just changed after prayer and
[1:07:23] God began to speak about if you could
[1:07:25] just just step into the fire and let it
[1:07:28] release you right who is here when that
[1:07:30] happened that you you when he begin
[1:07:32] speaking I realized this this is not him
[1:07:35] some people may be sat there saying well
[1:07:36] he's just making comments it wasn't him
[1:07:38] making comments that was the voice of
[1:07:40] God speaking amen and then we had a
[1:07:42] tongue's interpretation now this is the
[1:07:44] best we could compile of it I said I've
[1:07:46] spoken unto you this night do not fear
[1:07:48] believe my word have faith and believe
[1:07:50] if you knew what lay Beyond the Veil you
[1:07:51] would rejoice in the fire as you would
[1:07:53] see uh as you would see what it delivers
[1:07:56] you from and You' volunteer for it rest
[1:07:58] in the trial don't fear fear gives power
[1:08:01] to the enemy but Faith brings
[1:08:03] Deliverance amen so our friends I tell
[1:08:06] you if we could if we could just look
[1:08:08] Beyond the Veil this is why this message
[1:08:09] came to you for you to look Beyond the
[1:08:11] Veil I mean if we could just look Beyond
[1:08:13] these five senses and look beyond our
[1:08:15] troubles and look beyond what we're
[1:08:16] going through and now you know our stuff
[1:08:19] it'll all be gone you say this trial is
[1:08:22] so big it'll all be gone I mean it won't
[1:08:25] even be remembered one day it'll just be
[1:08:28] thank you Lord you brought me out of
[1:08:29] that thing thank you Lord you proved
[1:08:30] yourself in the trial amen so we
[1:08:32] shouldn't be now I'm not diminishing
[1:08:34] what anyone's going through that's big
[1:08:36] right but don't let it become a mountain
[1:08:38] when it's a mole hill compared to the
[1:08:40] delivering power amen the consoling
[1:08:43] power the leading power of our God Amen
[1:08:47] fear gives power to the enemy now I was
[1:08:48] thinking about
[1:08:50] that what you so instead of giving fear
[1:08:55] gives power to the enemy what about a
[1:08:57] Godly fear would give power to God if
[1:09:00] you take it vice versa we know we don't
[1:09:02] fear God Like We Fear the enemy but we
[1:09:03] have a Godly reverence right but if we
[1:09:06] let the Lord have power and Dominion in
[1:09:08] our life it would give power to the Lord
[1:09:10] I mean you know it says faith brings
[1:09:13] deliverance we got to realize that we're
[1:09:15] going through we're going through a a
[1:09:18] developing process this is why we should
[1:09:21] embrace the fire now you don't really
[1:09:24] see this much anymore but it used to be
[1:09:26] that's that's uh film here's a here's a
[1:09:29] history
[1:09:30] lesson Once Upon a Time digital cameras
[1:09:34] didn't exist not that long ago actually
[1:09:38] so you'd have film and you'd take photos
[1:09:40] and you couldn't just click you know you
[1:09:42] know get trigger happy only what 30 I
[1:09:44] don't know what it was on a roll not
[1:09:45] many she had to really you don't want to
[1:09:47] waste those photos right who's with me
[1:09:49] okay but then the thing is if you took
[1:09:51] that film and you rolled it out in the
[1:09:52] light it would destroy the image that's
[1:09:54] there so so so you took it into a
[1:09:57] photography place and they developed it
[1:09:59] in a dark room that's what that is on
[1:10:01] the right hand side that's uh a red
[1:10:03] light which doesn't doesn't damage the
[1:10:06] doesn't damage the film so in that
[1:10:09] condition in a dark room now the film
[1:10:11] can be you know it's put through a
[1:10:12] chemical process until that film is
[1:10:15] developed so the image that's hidden on
[1:10:17] that film comes out right in a dark room
[1:10:21] now this is exactly what God is doing
[1:10:23] now for us this world is a dark room
[1:10:27] right this compared to Heaven this place
[1:10:29] is a dark room right but there's an
[1:10:31] image that God took of you brother brah
[1:10:33] says he took a photo of you at your best
[1:10:35] and put it in his family album before
[1:10:37] the foundation of the world Amen so now
[1:10:40] what is he doing he's using this dark
[1:10:41] room to to to to bring out the image
[1:10:45] that he took amen so that's why I say
[1:10:48] praise the Lord for the fire there's a
[1:10:50] chemical process going on Amen it's fire
[1:10:53] and trial and all the Temptations and
[1:10:55] troubles and all these things but it's a
[1:10:57] process God is developing us into what
[1:11:00] he saw of us before the foundation of
[1:11:02] the world Amen that's why it says count
[1:11:04] it all joy when you come into trials
[1:11:06] Temptations and trouble amen don't be
[1:11:08] downcast you're going to realize Lord
[1:11:10] You're developing me in this trouble in
[1:11:13] this hardship in this question in this
[1:11:15] doubt in this trouble Whatever It Is God
[1:11:17] you're you're actually bringing out the
[1:11:19] real
[1:11:20] me hallelujah amen and he don't hold up
[1:11:24] any one of his Imes in the bright light
[1:11:26] and it's destroyed no he keeps it in the
[1:11:29] process until the vibrancy of the color
[1:11:32] the character of the word amen His Image
[1:11:34] is developed completely in you and I
[1:11:37] praise the Lord I like that don't you
[1:11:39] amen we are in a developing and he's the
[1:11:42] master
[1:11:43] photographer Hallelujah so I think you
[1:11:46] know it's easy to say but I think Lord
[1:11:49] change our attitude trouble strikes
[1:11:52] thank you Lord you can this is an
[1:11:54] opportunity to be developed Hallelujah
[1:11:57] you want to bring out something that
[1:11:58] could never come out of me if I never
[1:12:00] had this trial got this hardship thank
[1:12:03] you Lord got this question trouble even
[1:12:05] in the home whatever's going thank you
[1:12:06] Lord you're you're developing me through
[1:12:08] this process Lord
[1:12:11] amen praise the Lord now you
[1:12:14] see we God wants to break
[1:12:17] tradition God is a tradition breaking
[1:12:20] God now when Peter James I'm just I'm
[1:12:22] just doing a bit of a Segway here now
[1:12:23] when Peter James and John uh Jesus took
[1:12:26] them up what we call Mount
[1:12:27] Transfiguration and Jesus was
[1:12:29] transfigured before them and they saw
[1:12:31] Moses and Elijah talking talking with
[1:12:33] the Lord and then so while all this was
[1:12:36] going on Peter said Lord uh it is good
[1:12:38] for us to be here if thou will let us uh
[1:12:40] be here uh let us make let us make here
[1:12:44] three Tabernacles one for thee one for
[1:12:46] Moses and one for Elias so what he
[1:12:48] wanted to do was was build three
[1:12:51] churches but you see God wasn't
[1:12:53] interested in in in building churches a
[1:12:56] tradition like a synagogue or something
[1:12:58] of the past he was there to build
[1:13:00] something new right because many times
[1:13:02] people will take a take something God
[1:13:04] did in the past they build a tradition
[1:13:06] around it but God doesn't want to do
[1:13:08] that because while Peter yet spake while
[1:13:10] he yet spake there's a voice came out a
[1:13:13] cloud overshadowed them and behold a
[1:13:14] voice came out of the cloud said this is
[1:13:16] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[1:13:18] hear ye him so so God is telling them
[1:13:21] don't build churches based on a
[1:13:23] tradition of what you've seen hear the
[1:13:25] voice of the Lord amen so now and then
[1:13:28] and then when all this was over you know
[1:13:31] Jesus touched them and he said arise do
[1:13:33] not be afraid and when they had lifted
[1:13:35] up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus
[1:13:37] only so there was a there was a
[1:13:39] something in man to to build something
[1:13:41] around something that God did in the
[1:13:44] past and brother R said when a messenger
[1:13:46] comes and then when he goes what happens
[1:13:49] is man makes a tradition of his
[1:13:53] life now we aren't called to make
[1:13:57] traditions of church age Messengers we
[1:13:59] aren't called to live around the
[1:14:01] tradition of the prophet's life though I
[1:14:02] value those things and appreciate it all
[1:14:04] but you see what was the purpose of the
[1:14:06] message was to hear ye him hear the
[1:14:09] voice of God am me that that voice would
[1:14:11] be transferred into a people then lived
[1:14:14] out it become a lived voice amen it
[1:14:16] would be something that's it be
[1:14:18] something that's lived not just spoken
[1:14:19] about but
[1:14:21] manifested amen and so because a
[1:14:24] tradition is something that's been
[1:14:25] handed down we ain't called to hand down
[1:14:28] a tradition see this is the danger of a
[1:14:31] lady see in church age just like it was
[1:14:33] when Jesus came it the synagogue turned
[1:14:36] into a tradition the Jewish religion
[1:14:38] turned into a tradition am mean you know
[1:14:41] people had their Community they had
[1:14:43] their you know this is my Rabbi this is
[1:14:45] the synagogue this is where I go this is
[1:14:46] what my family does and and instead of
[1:14:48] seeing the power of God the god of Moses
[1:14:51] and Elijah living amen that same one
[1:14:54] like Gideon inste if God be for us if
[1:14:56] God be with us where are the Miracles
[1:14:58] where's the reality of the great
[1:14:59] unchanging God instead of those kind of
[1:15:02] questions being asked they just well we
[1:15:04] have our tradition we're moses'
[1:15:05] disciples but there's no move of God to
[1:15:08] prove what they believed was actually
[1:15:10] real God don't want us to do that God
[1:15:13] don't want us sure it's great to have a
[1:15:14] good Community I thank the Lord that we
[1:15:16] have such a wonderful family here amen
[1:15:19] praise the Lord for everyone here right
[1:15:21] but we we don't want to just settle down
[1:15:24] with a good Community amen cuz church is
[1:15:27] more than just a community sure we need
[1:15:29] each other we're a body amen but why do
[1:15:31] we come together is that the Living God
[1:15:33] would come down and prove his word in
[1:15:35] our midst amen that the fire of God that
[1:15:38] fell at Pentecost would fall again today
[1:15:40] amen that the Living God would would
[1:15:42] Quicken us our eyes would come open that
[1:15:44] we'd see hey we're more than just part
[1:15:45] of a church amen but no we have a seat
[1:15:48] at the wedding supper table amen over in
[1:15:51] Glory Hallelujah just like you know to
[1:15:53] me it's like the reason why why Moses uh
[1:15:57] this is more than a burning bush but I
[1:15:58] you I'll get to this but Moses to me the
[1:16:01] reason that that that that God revealed
[1:16:04] himself as a flaming fire and a burning
[1:16:06] bush to Moses was more than just the
[1:16:08] fact that you know um um that that it
[1:16:11] was unusual but God was now God was
[1:16:14] telling Moses Moses I'm going to make
[1:16:16] you like this I'm going to set you flame
[1:16:19] cuz a bush is a tree right am mean men
[1:16:21] are trees amen we're trees symbolically
[1:16:24] in the Bible amen so so God was telling
[1:16:26] Moses Moses I'm going to set you a flame
[1:16:29] amen it's going to be more than just
[1:16:30] your ideas of how to deliver Israel but
[1:16:32] I'm going to set you as a torch amen I'm
[1:16:34] going to live through your life I'm
[1:16:36] going to prove amen my word that my word
[1:16:38] is right and true and I'm here to
[1:16:40] deliver Hallelujah then what happened on
[1:16:43] the day of Pentecost there wasn't one
[1:16:44] tree there was 120 in the upper room
[1:16:48] amen that fire came down amen filled
[1:16:50] them and then what they do they were set
[1:16:52] a flame by the Holy Ghost amen and they
[1:16:54] stepped out into the street began to
[1:16:56] preach and you know the people made fun
[1:16:58] but Peter just said this is that spoken
[1:17:00] by the prophet Joel in other words what
[1:17:02] Joel prophesied you're seeing the
[1:17:04] Fulfillment am mean so you're seeing
[1:17:06] your your it went from a picture in the
[1:17:08] Bible to a reality right in front of
[1:17:11] them amen but they became burning bushes
[1:17:13] full of the Holy Ghost you know the best
[1:17:15] thing to deal with anything is
[1:17:17] fire the best cleaning agent there is
[1:17:20] the best way to sanitize something is
[1:17:22] you burn it amen that's the best thing
[1:17:25] you want to you know maybe you you how
[1:17:28] how do they used to clean medical um
[1:17:30] instruments that set them on you know
[1:17:32] they put them in a
[1:17:33] flame why because it burns all the bugs
[1:17:36] burns out all the trouble am mean so
[1:17:38] they don't they don't work it out any
[1:17:39] other way and it's the same thing with
[1:17:41] us friends the best way to burn out the
[1:17:43] problems of life is fire the best way to
[1:17:45] get rid of it is the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:17:48] here is the answer it's more than just
[1:17:49] psychologically working things out see
[1:17:51] an eagle will look to the end and say
[1:17:53] Lord you've made me in the image of your
[1:17:55] word this is my destination that's where
[1:17:57] I'm going Lord so father burn everything
[1:17:59] out of my life that I will match that
[1:18:02] image Hallelujah sure I've got trouble
[1:18:04] I've got hardships all these things
[1:18:05] instead of trying to put them in a
[1:18:07] compartment set it a flame well how do
[1:18:09] you set it a flame get G get immersed in
[1:18:12] the word of God and say God Quicken this
[1:18:15] to me as I listen Lord I don't just want
[1:18:17] to have an intellectual experience I
[1:18:19] don't just want to be able to just put
[1:18:20] it all together I want it to live Lord I
[1:18:23] want to change my life cuz tell you
[1:18:25] friends you get wood on the fire you let
[1:18:27] the Holy Ghost Fire come down you'll
[1:18:29] have a bonfire amen you'll have a
[1:18:31] Revival like you've never seen amen
[1:18:33] hallelujah and you know what I love
[1:18:35] about everyone here if you're not on
[1:18:38] fire you're tender
[1:18:40] dry Hallelujah I remember we went to um
[1:18:44] was it not last well was it last
[1:18:46] November we went to Brisbane or was it I
[1:18:47] can't remember when anyway the other
[1:18:49] November sometime we went there we
[1:18:51] stayed with um Jeff and betus they got a
[1:18:54] lifestyle block
[1:18:55] uh in land from Brisbane and they had
[1:18:56] just this little pile of uh scrub or uh
[1:19:00] you know stuff they've cut down they
[1:19:01] wanted to burn it and I'm thinking okay
[1:19:04] they're going to need petrol they're
[1:19:05] going to need you know to get it going
[1:19:06] cuz in here in New Zealand I've seen you
[1:19:08] I've seen like bombfire you know piles
[1:19:10] of uh stuff as big as this building on a
[1:19:13] Farms you know set on fire but they had
[1:19:14] to ignite it with some petrol and Jeff
[1:19:17] brother Jeff just took a match put it in
[1:19:20] and the thing just
[1:19:21] went I thought my I can see how these
[1:19:23] bush fires just like spread like
[1:19:26] wildfire but you see that thing's tended
[1:19:28] dry it's in a good environment it's in a
[1:19:30] good atmosphere it's not in a wet
[1:19:31] atmosphere it's not in a cold atmosphere
[1:19:33] it's not in a damp atmosphere it's in a
[1:19:35] dry atmosphere the sun's been shining I
[1:19:38] it's been preparing it to be set Ablaze
[1:19:40] amen I believe this is not a wet damp
[1:19:42] church I I believe we're not sitting in
[1:19:44] a refrigerator I mean we're not in a
[1:19:47] freezer of a cold atmosphere of an
[1:19:48] indifference and a you know no no love
[1:19:52] there's no faith there's no joy it's not
[1:19:53] you know clicks and stuff don't exist in
[1:19:56] this place I mean I believe this is a
[1:19:57] dry Sunny environment it causes us to
[1:20:01] become tender dry that the fire of God
[1:20:03] can come down consume out all of our
[1:20:05] problems Hallelujah so what does God
[1:20:07] want to do he wants to set us Ablaze
[1:20:09] with his holy ghost amen you know we
[1:20:12] have the Dynamics and the mechanics I
[1:20:13] know I've said it before but you know we
[1:20:15] have the mechanics of the word and the
[1:20:17] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and you know
[1:20:19] what I love about this age is it's God
[1:20:22] unlimited amen down through the church
[1:20:24] agees God was restricted by how much he
[1:20:26] could move by Creeds and dogmas kept the
[1:20:28] door closed but brother R says this anti
[1:20:30] message releases the Holy Ghost upon the
[1:20:33] people so therefore there is no limit to
[1:20:35] what God can do there's no limitation
[1:20:38] there's no restriction there's no
[1:20:39] there's no word of man that could hinder
[1:20:41] his moving he can do whatever he wants
[1:20:44] whenever he wants however he wants amen
[1:20:46] you can be driving in the car he can
[1:20:47] step in and change your life you're
[1:20:49] walking down the street getting
[1:20:50] groceries washing dishes you can be
[1:20:52] working you be at home you can be in
[1:20:54] church wherever and God can come down
[1:20:56] step in and transform your life meet
[1:20:58] your need amen cuz what does that do
[1:21:00] that's Eagle Vision Eagle anointing
[1:21:02] realizing he's the same yesterday today
[1:21:04] and forever I think if there's ever a
[1:21:06] time that we should let God have his way
[1:21:08] is right now amen because God has opened
[1:21:11] his floodgates of Heaven amen and
[1:21:14] pouring out his Spirit like never
[1:21:17] before and the Devil comes along and
[1:21:19] says I ain't seen nothing actually no
[1:21:22] you've seen a lot the devil knows God
[1:21:25] Lives the devil knows that God Lives in
[1:21:28] You amen but he wants to push that to
[1:21:30] one side to make you think you've got to
[1:21:32] overcome a different way I said no no
[1:21:34] why don't we go back to letting God fix
[1:21:36] our problems why don't we let God coming
[1:21:38] instead of trying to psychologically
[1:21:40] work things out and just let our
[1:21:42] emotions run wild run wild why don't we
[1:21:44] talk to the Lord about it and then let
[1:21:47] him fix it I'm all for counseling all
[1:21:49] these things you want to come talk
[1:21:51] absolutely but at the end of it what
[1:21:54] what be done prayer God comes down meets
[1:21:57] the need amen our God is the answer our
[1:22:01] God is the answer was he not the answer
[1:22:03] for your sin was he not the answer for
[1:22:06] your unbelief was he not the answer for
[1:22:08] your troubles am mean has he not picked
[1:22:10] you up out of the myy clay has he not
[1:22:12] been the answer that he said Lord I need
[1:22:14] Deliverance he says I'm your answer am
[1:22:15] me Lord I'm in trouble where he said I'm
[1:22:17] your answer amen has he not done it in
[1:22:19] the past amen will he not do it now and
[1:22:21] do it in the future absolutely God has
[1:22:24] not changed amen he has not pulled his
[1:22:26] hand off of you his hand is right on you
[1:22:28] he's with you amen he's for you
[1:22:30] Hallelujah so let him live amen let him
[1:22:33] do what he wants to do Hallelujah God
[1:22:36] hasn't forsaken you he is he said I'll
[1:22:38] never leave you nor forsake you you say
[1:22:40] well I feel as dead as a post that got
[1:22:43] nothing to do with our God Amen your
[1:22:45] feelings me nothing just say that God I
[1:22:47] believe your word I choose to say amen I
[1:22:49] choose to accept your deliverance I
[1:22:51] choose to accept your presence Lord I
[1:22:54] believe you Hallelujah and you'll begin
[1:22:57] to see God do the exceedingly abundantly
[1:22:59] don't be discouraged by what you
[1:23:01] see amen you imagine a young brother he
[1:23:05] turns his whole life against trying to
[1:23:07] destroy the work of
[1:23:08] God you know that was the Apostle Paul
[1:23:12] do you know he was a man under
[1:23:13] conviction the prophet said he was a man
[1:23:16] under
[1:23:17] conviction if we looked at him the wrong
[1:23:20] way and we just saw how he was fighting
[1:23:23] the church and destroying at doing all
[1:23:25] these things we get discouraged saying
[1:23:26] Lord I you the Lord Of Glory and look at
[1:23:28] what you're allowing to be done but if
[1:23:30] we looked at through Eagle Vision we say
[1:23:33] Lord thank you this man is acting up
[1:23:35] because he's under
[1:23:37] conviction hallelujah amen so when we
[1:23:40] look at trouble look at responses of
[1:23:41] people or family and maybe they just
[1:23:43] throw it back in your face you say Lord
[1:23:45] I believe they're under conviction Lord
[1:23:47] thank you Lord you're working thank you
[1:23:49] Lord there's a response coming from them
[1:23:51] cuz any response means there's an
[1:23:53] emotion moving there's thoughts coming
[1:23:55] amen there's there's reasoning coming
[1:23:57] and the reason all that's coming is God
[1:23:59] is knocking am mean God is calling amen
[1:24:01] so never be discouraged by the response
[1:24:03] you get you say Thank You Lord there's a
[1:24:06] response
[1:24:08] hallelujah amen everything works
[1:24:10] together for
[1:24:11] good praise the Lord you think so yeah
[1:24:14] you may think I'm crazy but no I ain't
[1:24:15] crazy I know where I am I know who he is
[1:24:18] that's the main
[1:24:19] thing praise the Lord
[1:24:22] amen hallelujah now let's just go down
[1:24:25] to well let's just go to this it's a
[1:24:27] question that comes
[1:24:29] up brother makes a statement he says he
[1:24:32] says in the third seal he says there's
[1:24:35] been millions and you know don't think
[1:24:36] we got revivals the bride hasn't had a
[1:24:38] Revival yet see It'll take these seven
[1:24:41] unknown Thunders back here to wake her
[1:24:42] up again this is what cause her to come
[1:24:45] come awakened these seven unknown
[1:24:46] Thunders now we understand from the
[1:24:49] Bible that when when Jesus was standing
[1:24:51] I'm just covering these things quickly
[1:24:52] because I want to get to something Jes
[1:24:54] Jesus would Jesus would say father
[1:24:56] glorify thy name uh but then there came
[1:24:59] a voice from Heaven saying I both
[1:25:00] glorified it and will glorify it again
[1:25:03] and the people therefore that stood by
[1:25:04] and heard it uh said that it thundered
[1:25:07] others said an angel spake to him so
[1:25:09] then some heard as it a um as a thunder
[1:25:12] others heard the voice right so a so a
[1:25:15] thunder is the word of God not made
[1:25:17] clear now they could argue all they want
[1:25:19] about what it meant or that Thunder or
[1:25:22] what type of Thunder it was or you know
[1:25:23] all these things but those who heard the
[1:25:25] voice knew exactly what was spoken and
[1:25:29] there you say their eyes came open now
[1:25:32] when the Thunders are no longer Thunders
[1:25:34] but they a voice what does it do it
[1:25:36] awakens the bride and brother Rams asked
[1:25:39] a very simple question he says have the
[1:25:41] seven Thunders which equal the seven
[1:25:42] Mysteries already been revealed were
[1:25:44] they revealed in the Seven Seals but as
[1:25:46] yet are not known to us as the Thunders
[1:25:47] yet he says no they were revealed in the
[1:25:50] Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was
[1:25:52] about I mean so he say saying that those
[1:25:54] seven Thunders are no longer Thunders
[1:25:56] they're a voice amen so so it's been
[1:25:59] interpreted to you it's been made clear
[1:26:01] to you I trust I trust when you see or
[1:26:03] when you when you read Revelations 4 and
[1:26:06] 5 and the seals and things you see Jesus
[1:26:08] Christ redeeming
[1:26:10] you amen more than symbols more than
[1:26:13] horse riders but you actually see
[1:26:15] because remember brother raham said that
[1:26:16] that book of redemption he typed it as
[1:26:19] Boaz claiming Ruth same as the lamb
[1:26:21] taking the book am mean so he's saying
[1:26:23] now that that book when it's claimed
[1:26:25] it's actually Jesus Christ claiming you
[1:26:27] because you're part of that book
[1:26:29] Hallelujah why you talking about these
[1:26:30] things is because when that's reveal to
[1:26:32] you God saying that my Plan of
[1:26:34] Redemption is going to be completed in
[1:26:36] your life am mean I'm not just going to
[1:26:38] leave you guessing if you're going to
[1:26:39] make it or guessing if everything's
[1:26:41] going to be fine no I'm proving to you
[1:26:43] what I have done there amen is happening
[1:26:46] you on an age level is happening in your
[1:26:48] life amen that I have claimed you you're
[1:26:51] mine who's stronger than our God no no
[1:26:55] one so who can take that book who can
[1:26:57] take you out of his hand he said no can
[1:27:00] no one can pluck them out of my hand
[1:27:03] hallelujah amen so what does that do now
[1:27:06] now if it's this thing if if he's saying
[1:27:08] that the you know the bride has not been
[1:27:09] awaken you'll take these s unknown
[1:27:11] Thunders but the but now these Thunders
[1:27:14] have have have uttered their voices
[1:27:15] they're no longer a thunder but they're
[1:27:16] a voice now what is that mean it now it
[1:27:18] means the bride is having a Revival
[1:27:21] don't diminish what God has done in your
[1:27:23] life this is what I really want to get
[1:27:25] to don't diminish what God has done in
[1:27:27] your life this word has awoken you am
[1:27:30] mean it has quickened you it's made you
[1:27:31] alive you a Revival is an Awakening I
[1:27:34] mean like brother R would say about
[1:27:35] standing on Lake Michigan it's see the
[1:27:38] you know the lake churning up and the
[1:27:39] waves cu the wind is blowing and it's a
[1:27:42] a Revival is a is is a stirring of the
[1:27:44] waters amen it causes all the trashes in
[1:27:47] the lake to be swept out on the shore I
[1:27:50] mean so when the Holy Ghost comes down
[1:27:51] into the church it causes a Revival it
[1:27:54] causes an Awakening that you that water
[1:27:56] that's just like you know you look out
[1:27:57] here it may be dead flat out there at
[1:27:59] the moment I don't know but you know you
[1:28:01] just let that souly blow up the blow
[1:28:03] into the harbor it begins to churn you
[1:28:05] know trash is washed up on the bank why
[1:28:08] cuz the bay is having a Revival amen now
[1:28:10] it's the same thing with you and I
[1:28:12] friends is that when the Holy Ghost
[1:28:14] moves and that's why we should always be
[1:28:16] be so hungry Lord blow through this
[1:28:18] place sweep over my life Lord the logs
[1:28:22] and the trash and stuff in my life that
[1:28:24] maybe I don't even know there get washed
[1:28:26] up on the bank Hallelujah so amen so now
[1:28:30] we are living in a day of the bride's
[1:28:32] Revival we're living in this day we're
[1:28:35] not waiting for it to come we're not
[1:28:37] waiting for another messenger there
[1:28:38] ain't no eighth messenger I say there is
[1:28:40] one it's Jesus Christ himself he is the
[1:28:43] word amen he is this message he is the
[1:28:45] eighth messenger if I can say it that
[1:28:47] way so it's not a man that's going to
[1:28:48] come and make all these things clear
[1:28:50] it's already be made clear by the spirit
[1:28:51] of Revelation amen so now we
[1:28:54] so so so now the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:56] embodies the Revival of this
[1:28:59] day
[1:29:00] amen praise the Lord that brother BR
[1:29:03] would would would speak about people
[1:29:05] going to going to Wales people from
[1:29:07] America would go and they're trying to
[1:29:08] find where is this Welsh revival going
[1:29:10] on and you know he would you know and
[1:29:13] and and these ones bumped into a bumped
[1:29:15] into a policeman twirling his baton and
[1:29:17] whistling a tuner I'm so glad I can say
[1:29:19] I'm one of them or I don't know what
[1:29:20] they are singing and they said good man
[1:29:23] can you tell us where the Welsh Revival
[1:29:25] is see they're looking for a church
[1:29:27] system that it would be that it would be
[1:29:28] allocated in but this man said he said
[1:29:31] he said uh yes Brethren you're standing
[1:29:34] in the middle of it they're expecting a
[1:29:36] building and a thing but no but but no
[1:29:38] he realized he had been awakened by the
[1:29:41] Welsh Revival that the Welsh Revival was
[1:29:43] sent because of him am mean that he was
[1:29:45] a dormant seed that was asleep but had
[1:29:47] to come awake amen so he realized
[1:29:49] actually no the Welsh Revival my good
[1:29:51] friends is not in a building it's in me
[1:29:54] amen he is the embodiment of the Welsh
[1:29:56] Revival now I say friends the reason
[1:29:58] this message came is to awaken you that
[1:30:00] you'd realize people say where is the
[1:30:02] bride's Revival happening at is it in
[1:30:04] Jeffersonville Tucson or somewhere say
[1:30:06] said no it's going on right here
[1:30:09] hallelujah I am the bride's Revival I
[1:30:11] have been awakened amen by this message
[1:30:14] Amen to realize that I am the Bride of
[1:30:16] Jesus Christ hallelujah amen you ask me
[1:30:19] why I'm happy I've been awakened I'm not
[1:30:22] sleepwalking anymore I I know who I I
[1:30:24] know who I am I know where I stand I
[1:30:27] know who my God is I mean I know that
[1:30:30] he's here present to meet every need
[1:30:32] he's a God that proves his word don't be
[1:30:34] discouraged do not ever be discouraged
[1:30:37] the devil wants you to be discouraged
[1:30:38] trying to make you think that that
[1:30:40] mountain cannot move I say it will
[1:30:42] become a plane I mean that impossible
[1:30:44] thing that's been standing there for
[1:30:45] years you go look at maybe the Southern
[1:30:47] Alps or Mount R pay who you think that
[1:30:49] thing could never
[1:30:51] move who made that mountain God made
[1:30:54] that mountain am mean God allowed that
[1:30:57] mountain to be there I say the he
[1:30:59] actually allows the enemy to put
[1:31:00] mountains in your life cuz he wants to
[1:31:03] move that mountain he's in the
[1:31:04] construction business he likes to move
[1:31:06] Earthworks things that you think can
[1:31:07] never be moved no God wants to move it
[1:31:10] Hallelujah we got to realize God is here
[1:31:13] to move that mountain you say can it be
[1:31:14] done absolutely amen Jonah was in the
[1:31:17] belly of a whale he got out what did he
[1:31:20] do he prayed in Faith Lord be merci to
[1:31:24] me he moved the mountain of a whales
[1:31:26] Bley Hallelujah um Lazarus was 4 days in
[1:31:30] the Tomb that's a big mountain that's an
[1:31:32] impossible Mountain it ain't impossible
[1:31:34] to the resurrection in the life no he
[1:31:36] stood there said Lazarus come forth and
[1:31:38] we know if he did not call them by name
[1:31:40] there would have been a general
[1:31:41] Resurrection amen so that mountain was
[1:31:43] moved amen hallelujah Legion a thousand
[1:31:46] demons or however I think a Legions more
[1:31:48] than that that's a big mountain nothing
[1:31:51] could move it they tried to chain him up
[1:31:53] they tried to re itate him but what
[1:31:54] happened no he needed the mountain mover
[1:31:56] to step on the scene and and and set him
[1:31:59] free that same Jesus is here today amen
[1:32:03] he's living in our lives amen he hasn't
[1:32:05] changed he's the same in power and
[1:32:07] ability he is the mountain mover amen so
[1:32:09] now friends if he is that amen has he
[1:32:12] not awakened us to that
[1:32:14] fact amen so so what are we called to do
[1:32:17] we're called to respond in faith saying
[1:32:19] Lord you see this mountain you see this
[1:32:22] problem Lord I not satisfied with it
[1:32:25] being there Lord can you move it you
[1:32:27] it's exactly the same as Adam and Eve in
[1:32:29] the garden brother Brown would say
[1:32:31] there'd be like a cool wind blow and Eve
[1:32:33] would say oh I feel cold or I don't like
[1:32:35] it Adam would just say peace wind he
[1:32:38] controlled that thing it was the voice
[1:32:40] of Adam that controlled the wind cuz the
[1:32:43] second Adam controlled it right so now
[1:32:45] it's the same thing now in this day a
[1:32:47] Cold Wind Blows do you put up with it
[1:32:50] who loves to sit in a draft and it's not
[1:32:52] hot
[1:32:55] no one what do you do you close a window
[1:32:59] you close a door do something to remove
[1:33:02] the draft so if that's it in the natural
[1:33:06] why do we put up with drafts in the
[1:33:09] spiritual amen because you need Faith to
[1:33:11] believe when I close that door it's
[1:33:13] going to move when I physically you know
[1:33:14] apply Force to it right you believe you
[1:33:17] know it's like these lights when we turn
[1:33:18] them on we believe the switch there is
[1:33:20] going to turn these lights on brother R
[1:33:22] said it's that faith that applies the
[1:33:24] it's simple everyday common faith that
[1:33:27] applies the blood amen so so why do we
[1:33:30] sit there with a draft coming through
[1:33:31] our life just sad counting
[1:33:35] goosebumps you know counting the effects
[1:33:37] of the draft and looking and and trying
[1:33:39] to work out well it's this and this is
[1:33:41] the problem why don't we just get up in
[1:33:42] faith and close the
[1:33:45] door amen why don't we just do that amen
[1:33:48] we can God's given us god-given
[1:33:50] authority to deal with these things so I
[1:33:53] say friends if we've been awakened in
[1:33:55] this day should we not not should we not
[1:33:58] now act upon what he's given
[1:34:00] us or we going to sit in a draft I say
[1:34:03] no let's close the door let's close the
[1:34:05] door to the you know the devil blows the
[1:34:07] draft of doubts you've gone too far you
[1:34:11] can never be forgiven this is not for
[1:34:13] you you don't even have a hunger you
[1:34:15] know everyone's got a hunger for God it
[1:34:17] just gets put onto something else you
[1:34:20] know it's like you you know you have a
[1:34:22] favorite Lolly or chocolate or something
[1:34:24] yeah whatever sweet sa right but then
[1:34:27] you find something way better what do
[1:34:29] you do your desire goes to the better
[1:34:32] thing right because now you could
[1:34:36] realize well of course I don't desire
[1:34:37] this thing anymore because my desire's
[1:34:39] been moved right you still have a desire
[1:34:42] it's just been moved onto something else
[1:34:44] so people say I have no pull you I've
[1:34:46] God in my life I've got no desire no you
[1:34:48] do it's just been moved on to the wrong
[1:34:51] thing and if we could just identify that
[1:34:53] the morning you may feel well there's
[1:34:54] nothing in me for God it's because the
[1:34:56] devil's moved it onto something else so
[1:34:59] why don't you just let God say God I
[1:35:01] want that desire you've built in my life
[1:35:04] to come on to you and now Lord then then
[1:35:06] the Lord can begin to work again
[1:35:09] amen
[1:35:11] amen praise the
[1:35:14] Lord I'm just going to I'm just going to
[1:35:16] finish with
[1:35:18] this but nothing could conquer Christ
[1:35:21] he's speaking here from the pmos version
[1:35:23] he speaks about Napoleon and different
[1:35:24] ones he that descended is now ascended
[1:35:27] above all and unto him has has given a
[1:35:30] name that is above every name yes he
[1:35:32] conquered death hell and the grave and
[1:35:34] has the keys thereof what he looses is
[1:35:36] loosed and what he binds is bound
[1:35:39] there's no changing of it he's loosed
[1:35:41] you sir he's loosed you you're free if
[1:35:45] you're free you're free Hallelujah he's
[1:35:48] bound you in the chains of his love if
[1:35:50] you're bound you're
[1:35:51] bound Hallelujah nothing if he's loosed
[1:35:55] you nothing can bind you things may try
[1:35:57] but they won't work amen can you look
[1:36:00] beyond the problem that's going on in
[1:36:01] your life you no he's loosed me amen
[1:36:05] there's no changing of it there's no
[1:36:07] conqueror before him there's none beside
[1:36:08] him he alone is the savior Redeemer he's
