say welcome sister Gemma god bless you brother Jeremy good to see you again as well and welcome everyone here I mean thank you musicians praise the Lord I mean let's go to the scripture let's go to River let let's go to Genesis 15 to begin with I mean what a wonderful day the Lord has made Amen praise the Lord I mean it's got a Genesis 15 and from verse 7 jess is 15 and 7 this is the Lord speaking to Abraham and he said unto Him I'm the Lord that brought the out of the of the Chaldees to give the this land to inherit it he said Lord we're by a shell I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take their here for a three years old and as she go to three years old in a ram of three years old and a Turtledove and a young pigeon and he took under him all these and divided them in the mats and laid each piece one against another but the birds he divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses abraham abraham drove them away and when the son is oh I was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abraham and lower horror of great darkness fell upon him in II said unto Abraham know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance and thou shall go to thy father's and peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the EM rights is not yet full and it came to pass that when the Sun went down and it was dark will hold a burning furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces and the same day that the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the great river the Revue fray teased the Kenites the Kinser lights the Canaanites the Hittites the perizzites the refere moons and the emirates and the canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites amen and let's go to revelations 18 I'm going to read a couple of verses from revelations 18 just a bit of a gonna read revelations 18 and from verse 9 I just really want you to notice everything that this this great system is trading in but we're not for sale revelations 18 and 9 and the Kings the earth whom have committed fornication and have lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city Babylon that mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment come and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and a fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner of vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble and cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men amen may the Lord and licious read the next verse and the fruits that thy soul lusted after I departed from thee and all things that were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all amen may the Lord bless his word you may have have your seats this morning I like to speak about God's covenant with us now we read here in in Genesis 15 where God as God as giving a God as he's he's he's making a covenant with Abraham and we know when a covenant was made and in the Old Testament times that there would be an animal would be slain there would be an agreement would be made and and thus land animal will signify your both parties agreeing that if they cannot keep or do not keep the words of that covenant that they would be like that slain animal that's how they were pledging one to another and so we know God gave a time Adam and Eve the first conditional covenant you know don't eat of the tree the day you eat thereof that you know that day they shall die and as you know you know it was on condition and we know that man fell but God God began to even even in the judgment when when God was giving judgment to Adam and even the serpent they're in the garden he gave him an unconditional covenant that the seed of the woman would come and crush the head of the seed of the serpent and that was unconditional now God would God would show to to Abraham you know we we read here that that you know he he was bought out of the ear of the Chaldees so he wasn't from Babylon and God took him out of Babylon I'm you know he heard his voice and God told him to depart out of this country and he did he followed the voice of God not knowing where he was going to go but then God gave her may God gave him a sign that has that that the land then he promised would be his and hers and his children's and it was a it was a definite sign it wasn't just a nice idea it wasn't just some nice words but God gave a physical evidence by the sacrifices and God passes passing through the midst of them consuming them that this was God giving his covenant to Abraham that God was gonna give his children the land that God was gonna do it God was gonna place him in their inheritance it wasn't their doing it was God gonna do it and and and as I said in the opening remarks it and when we when two people would make a covenant they'd say if we do not uphold our into the bargain we will be like the slate animal that we have just killed I mean as a promise so now if God promises that he's going to do something then he's gonna do it I mean he cannot fail he cannot you know back up and what he has promised you know he says no I'm gonna do it and he puts everything all of his energies all of his power all of us might all that he is he actually joins himself to a people saying I am gonna give you what I promised you what I have given you in my word I will perform it to you amen and I cannot fail I cannot be you know I cannot fail I know you cannot do it hallelujah that's why when Jesus was hanging on Calvary you know your brother BAM says that God was riding a covenant with the families of the earth hallelujah so because he knew we could never do it we could never be perfect as our Father and heaven is perfect I mean so he became the slate animal he became our sacrifice I mean that his life would come upon us and we could actually manifest or fulfill I mean what God would have us do in this day Ilia so you know but I just want to read there from from revelations 18 because this great beasts power this this Mystery Babylon which is controlling the earth I mean it trades in the souls of men so not just in commodities not just in oil and precious things and you know your stock markets and money whatever more business all these things but it's the soul of men that are that are being traded slaves and the souls of men and we know that you know slavery is very much alive today I mean not just not just what we would call slavery like any you know you know your North and South America how they used to have slaves but people are still slaves I mean but the but but the you know the devil's greatest trick as if he can get you to believe that he is not real he has won because of the enemy any enemy that that gets the opposing force to think they are not working they're not active you know they have won the war like if just say you know we know that every nation has spies amen every nation has spies we have spies you know America's got spies Russia's got spies but imagine if we were you know what about what if we thought well there's no spies in this country well then they could come and they could do all this buying they could steal our secrets they could go because we wouldn't be watching out to try and protect what we have against the spice right so so if the enemy being you know tries to get us think well he's not real he's not working it's all in the people's minds it's just a figment of imagination to control people you know the devil's not really real he's got you I mean then he can really work and he can deal but if you can if you can identify your enemy and withstand him but the first thing is you got to identify you enemy so now he says here that the that that this system has made made slaves and it also trades the souls of men and I was thinking you know that you know every every year I guess you know you know and base it well not not every year in some sports but you know in America there's the draft for the basketball and different different great leagues of your sport and and and people get traded players get sold they get bought they get traded around what's happening there's there's people trading and and and and the sports teams they don't really care about the player they just want to make money from the player that's all they care about why does why does a great brand you know sign someone to - - you know some advertising you know contract with a great player they don't really care about the play they're just using that player to make money amen whoa what's happening they're trading people to actually get benefit out of that person if that person can no longer play like they used to can no longer perform no longer as famous they just get contracts over goodbye what's happening they're being traded amen and the devil wants to trade you he'll give you a kingdom he came to Jesus said if you just bow down and worship me I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world I mean and it's the value you take a very famous player in the world there can be hundreds of millions of dollars for a contract because that's the value that the sports teams put on a certain star but if he's not very good well then within his value will go down very low so the devil will try and give you a kingdom amen it may be a very small kingdom you may just have an influence over a few people or something you know you know but he will try and buy you we're not but the Bride of Christ cannot be bought I mean we cannot be traded we can't be swapped I mean by some spirit for one spirit to another spirit from another you know we're not here to be traded because we've been called out hallelujah we've been caught by the voice of God in this day out of that system hallelujah amen so so we're not here to be treated hallelujah amen I just I was just happy thinking about that I mean I'm not for I'm not for sale I've been bought I can't be traded I can't be pawned off I can't be whatever because I'm bought with a price the blood of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but you've got to recognize you know but he has to make that covenant with you no no brother base isn't Israel in Egypt a 1953 season God showed Abraham what he was going to do that through the seed of Isaac he'd bring forth his only begotten Son Christ and was slain yonder between heavens and earth when the Sun went down the blackness over the earth and there he tore him apart he pulled his soul out of him and he wrote a covenant with the families of the earth where when their precious and adulterated blood of Almighty God drip from Emmanuel's veins he tore that soul out of him he cried my God my God why has thou forsaken me his face was full of mockery split a crown of cruel mockery pulled down over his brow his nails drove with Roman spikes his back was Riven until his ribs show through swinging on the cross screaming dying sinners death the sin of the world upon him and their God Rivard his side stole her soul out of him then he said into thy hands I commend my spirit and he dropped his head the earth shook and belch out its rocks there he is there's God's covenant there's the fulfilling of it hallelujah amen now no seas on the wings of a dove he says now what God is showing him here is this on these sacrifices of speaking of Christ that's how God took Jesus to to the Calvary and tore him apart and received the body up and to heaven sin the spirit down upon us that the same spirit that was on him has to be on you to dovetail with the body to be the bride at the end time see that's right won't be a denomination now it'll be the word what he was but like the word has to come to the word like cell and a human being you know that your body's being built it isn't one cell of a human mix of a pig mixed of a dog oh no no it's all human cell that's the way the body of Christ does all the Word of God not just part of it some tradition added to it no it's all the body of Christ as a word upon word upon word and when we're being built under the statue of the perfect man word upon word upon word I mean not human cell not hybrid not not man's ideas not tradition of man no it's word upon word upon word holy that's why you've got to see the value of reading you're reading the Bible listening to the message being in prayer coming to church you're being built up word upon word upon word build me up into your image Oh God I mean what you died what you wanted to achieve when you hang on Calvary might be manifested in my life hallelujah amen build me up grow me up Oh Lord hallelujah I mean because we know that God's God wrote a covenant with the families of the earth that he would take himself and multiplied himself into a people and me to produce himself and human beings I mean that what he was the Living Word of God will be manifested in the people hallelujah that's why he died wasn't I'm gonna make more of myself I'm gonna produce myself and my bride hallelujah so what he was I mean we become by His grace hallelujah I mean that's why I'm so great glad you know brother branham when he preaches you know it is the rising of the Sun it's not it's not a sermon it's not just a well and Easter message said he's going to preach and make us feel happy it's an announcement I mean when he when he reads from the feast in Leviticus saying that the mature part of the field was cut down given to the priests not to the prophet but to the priest and was waved before the Lord and Thanksgiving saying thank you Lord that the rest of the field the rest of the seed in the field will come forth like this one hallelujah and then Christ was cut down he was the mature part of the field I mean there was a Peter James and John the woman in the world there was a there's the Apostle Paul the first church I mean they were in the field hallelujah but he waved Christ's life was waved I mean over the people and God was giving thanks angle hallelujah this one's come forth they'll come for the same manner the same life hallelujah will be produced I mean a brother ham see that that same life was being waved I mean in this message being waved over people be waved over the earth hallelujah because in this field this seat hallelujah has not cockle burrs will come forth and as images sweet Elizabeth the same life and when you plant wheat you get wheat I mean you don't get pumpkins you don't get tomatoes or tangerines you get wheat you're exactly the same life was produced Polly and there's what this message does it produces Christ and a people I mean because the seed in the field which is you I mean when that life is waved or verdict comes forth hallelujah to God I mean so he's not just preaching a sermon he's making an announcement I mean and you take the you take Jesus Christ in his earthly ministry he had a lot of pressure I mean the whole world was against him I mean the devil was howling I mean but it didn't stop him unbelief didn't stop him the culture of the day didn't stop him the public opinion of the day didn't stop him holler He fulfilled what he was called to fulfill I mean if and if the life and him to death the same life and you will do the same thing I mean public opinion won't stop you if what people say won't stop you look the culture around you cannot stop you I mean if that life is manifesting hallelujah amen I have confidence in the seed I don't have confidence in me I mean I don't have confidence in my natural lineage or Who I am or IQ who cares about an IQ a man what about a spiritual IQ who you know not what you know who you know that's the important thing hallelujah glory to God I'm glad I know him Abraham had his struggles he wouldn't have been proud when when when Moses was writing down his life writing the book of Genesis you have Moses I mean if Abraham could have you know sat next to Moses because Moses you know you you know imagine that Abraham's resurrected sits next to Moses Moses what are you doing I'm writing Genesis Oh what party up to this man called Abraham oh that was me what party you're writing well I'm writing the part where where pressure came on any and he went down to Greer and he told Sarah his wife don't tell them that that that you know can you turn me down a little bit don't you know don't tell don't tell them that we're married say that you're my sister and they were half brother sister anyway you know do you think Abraham would have said are you right that but that was a great moment you know it's just a few 25 years of life it's condensed down just to you know into a few chapters just like highlights basically that's what God wanted you to know yeah everyone want to say please don't write that what why can't you write or why don't you emphasize more when I when I are my servants and I went and got lot back write more about that you know expand those kind of things please don't write that you know but it was all part of his journey the struggle with his humanity was part of his journey Holly a God ordained it God allowed it hallelujah we struggle with ourselves so much I mean sure we do but it doesn't change as I see it I don't have confidence in me I have confidence in the seat parlor you have confidence in the seat that's within you that has responded to the word that's the important part of you Amen hallelujah amen priscila that's why I'm glad win-win-win Paul the Apostle Paul after Calvary is riding Abraham's commentary of his life he doesn't pick up those things he doesn't pick up the failures he doesn't pick up the struggles he doesn't pick win-win when God came to him said you're gonna be the father of many nations and he rolls down a you know in front of God and laughs he laughs at the promise of God and in God's face he's laughing at him he's read that you know it wasn't you Syria that laughed Abraham was laughing Abraham had been called and God had done many mighty things I'm gonna make you father of nations and he rolls at his feet you or think God would have been offended it didn't stop God God didn't change his mind I can't work with the sky anymore I bought him this far but neither so I gotta find someone else no God was determined because he made an unconditional covenant with the man just like he made an unconditional covenant with you hallelujah but then when the Apostle Paul was writing down the commentary of Abraham's life he said he staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith giving praise to him fully frustrated that he would do it wholly a row Romans chapter 4 Amen why because the blood of Jesus Christ erases all that part I'm glad that the blood erases boots holy all the bad bits we're not proud off the blood takes care of it I mean he was wounded for our transgressions we had a lot of transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities we had a lot of iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes we are healed hallelujah amen so you know you know the devil comes against you you know always your humanity you did this and you did this and you did this and you did it you were there when it happened yeah you could agree you say yes devil yes yes yes but then you gotta say no no hold on that's not the end of the story that's not the end of the story I'm a child of the kingdom my father when I say my father which art in heaven I'm not just repeating words just just out of my mind I know who my father is I know who my hair belief hallelujah I know who my maker is it is God and the blood of jesus christ takes care of all those things you know that's why the word is written in such a way he was bruised for our iniquities amen amen he was wounded for our transgressions that covers everything I mean the chastisement of our peace was upon him hallelujah and with the stripes were healed it that just covers everything Amen hallelujah glory I think we can just dance out of here right now hallelujah isn't that wonderful I mean but that's what this message makes alive hallelujah amen so I mean and today so God has made a covenant with the peoples of the earth and conditional covenant he has to keep her side of the Covenant and he will and he does and today this is in the token from shreveport 63 and today the Holy Ghost is God's covenant with God's covenant people the Holy Ghost the life of the resurrected Christ has got to be displayed in the church amongst the people making him the same yesterday today and forever no matter how loyal a member you are you might be whatever you may be a good man or a good woman that is sure is fine we appreciate that but only the token will will keep you alive God's token you might be a student of the Bible you might be a good person you might even be the president you would be anything you want to be there's no excuses when God started the exodus from Egypt calling out Israel from Egypt to his promised land there was there was no excuse every man had to display the blood and today the Exodus is calling out of the systems into the bride no matter how much system urine it still requires the token of the life of Jesus Christ again nothing else will work still the token is required it remained no matter if he was a loyal man he might have been the Pharaoh of Egypt and he was the most important man of the day but the token had to be applied to him no matter how important he was whether he was a bishop a priest whatever a president King potentate monarch that had nothing to do that God only required the I mean God only recognized the token the Covenant people same thing today the Holy Ghost I mean the Holy Spirit will only recognize the Covenant people we find that death was ready to strike Egypt at any time now God has showed had showed them his grace his power and his signs hallelujah so God only recognizes those that have the Holy Ghost amen outside of that we're lost I mean but God only gives the Holy Spirit to us covenant people hallelujah amen isn't that wonderful Amy but you see now that we are living in this Exodus and this Exodus is very vital that the blood must be applied the token must be on display the life of God will what do you mean by that the life of God must be living in you he must be living out of your life amen that is more than just words on paper more than just quoting more than just memories Amen you're you're remembering Scripture but the life of God must put on flesh in in you hallelujah and it's absolutely vital I mean but uh but I want you to recognize Amen at the life of God is in you nothing can stand against you I mean there's great value in applying the blood I mean there is great for absolute value in applying the blood you've got to look at the reason why you're doing it I mean in the valley if you find no value in having the life of God in you you'll never apply it I mean you'll never put it on display Amy but if you recognize the power of the Holy Ghost I mean that no weapon formed against you shall prosper every demon power must be trodden under your feet holy that nothing can stand against you I mean no mind battle can can can overcome you you're the devil may fight you in your mind he has a right this is no-man's land oh but it but it's part of no this is no man's land this is where God and Satan said yes you God actually said yep this is where we're going to fight and God and you know the devil always picks the mind but God comes to the heart hallelujah I mean but but so that so the devil is right to fight you in here amen and he was and it's real amen buddy but he can never get the soul of the believer I mean he can never make a believer when the blood has really been applied they can never become an unbeliever I mean they can never walk and say there's nothing to it I don't care there's nothing there's no you can never become an unbeliever when the blood has been applied I mean when the life of God comes into you faith can never be taken from you it may be challenged there may be a war going on I mean but God is a conqueror God hasn't overcome him I mean our God is a God of War amen easily he is a God of peace but he's a God of War and he's never afraid of a challenge holler he loves a challenge I mean he loves faith to be challenged that's why he allows us to live in this evil age I mean that's why he called allows us to live in the darkest of ages I mean because he knows his blood will work I mean his covenant will hold I mean it will not break apart it will not dissolve I mean it will stand I mean it will overcome every condition of every age hallelujah and that's why he has confidence in his salvation hallelujah and that's why Jobe overcame he didn't understand what was going on you know in his life he didn't know why his children died and he lost everything is covered in boils but he was standing on the shed blood of the Lamb amen he knew to apply the blood he knew the value of offering the blood I mean not just for himself but for his children pre adventure that they may have sinned I mean he saw the value of it though he didn't know what happened in the next life though he didn't know those things but he applied the blood cuz he knew the value of it hallelujah and the value came back to show itself I mean when God came down in a whirlwind and spoke to him then joy began to see now I really recognize the value of applying the blood I mean it'll it'll it'll it'll pay back one of these days hallelujah and I just want to give you an announcement today it's it's work thus far has it not I mean we're still in faith hallelujah we're still walking in Revelation we're still walking in faith what the blood is playing off applying the blood paid off hallelujah and if it's paid off thus far it'll take us all the way hallelujah it'll take us all the way into a body change Amen you know I have mine battles like everyone else I have struggles like everyone else this week I didn't know which way was up or down you know so twist the devil had me so twisted up in my mind hallelujah way saying hallelujah because God overcame I mean but but you know you know when you become a Christian it doesn't mean now the devil can't touch you you just walk on and you know it's like you know used to play some game and you get like god mode that you're basically invincible you just shoot everyone you know and and and you can't get hurt it's not that way you know the devil still fires those dots he's still attacks you still have mine battles you save struggles and you know I think his brother and then he put on brothers and sisters that quit our brother and said God gives us his best trials afflictions and hardship that's God giving us as best you think how can that work well because God wants to mold a character in you God wants to produce his life in you and it's not a flowery bed of ease and say it is a rugged way it is a victorious way because you can look back and say thank God for the trial thank God for molding me thank God for changing me thank God for molding I mean my character that I'm not some spoiled brat anymore I mean but I have his character hallelujah I mean because of good because if someone has the character of Christ God can use that person God knows yes why brother brand went through many years of hardship and trial to the sword was placed in his hand hallelujah amen amen and that sword is on the bride how that word is in you I mean because it then just disappear was preached and it came into a people now priest speaks forth again totally that sharper chopped we just sort of the word us and you hallelujah but you've got to use it amen take off the safety and just use it hallelujah we should be on the warpath against the devil I mean we should never you know we shouldn't just build trenches and build bunkers and say this house gonna be no no charge you've heard the whistle blow go over the top hallelujah okay some people look at me blankly well do a one crazy war millions of people died and they were just yeah yeah a big artillery bombardment and then that all be in the trenches for a great offensive then they blow the whistle they go over the top and and charge at the enemy's trenches it was insane but we shouldn't be afraid of being hit amen just like I took I took an least through the glue Polly flinging tea popper I thought maybe be a bit scary but but but she she enjoyed it but then she came out there she was speaking to me yesterday she said you know because then there was a little Bible there's a bullet throat and and and and the man carrying it had the Bible here and the and the bullet didn't kill him and she said yo daddy that's just like win win win win the word is in your heart yeah yeah the devil fires bullets but it can't kill you hallelujah as the same thing with us we shouldn't be afraid of us fire don't worry about shell shock and what the devil can do against you I mean cuz no weapon formed against you shall prosper I mean we're called to overcome this war I'm a holla we're called to win hallelujah the whole armour of God is supernatural amen as the baptism of the Holy Ghost as this mess is put on flesh hallelujah and everyone I believe that we have the whole armour of God we have the best equipment you just have to have confidence in your equipment amen hallelujah I have the best weapon I have the best armor hallelujah the best the best you know P you know people make up big science fiction stories that you know people go to travel to this galaxy to find this super weapon to overcome some great enemy we have the super weapon hallelujah and there's nothing can match it it doesn't need to be upgraded brother em says the entire message meets in time conditions and this word meets in time conditions police it does need to be upgraded doesn't need to be honed in it works it'll go to the killing place every time hallelujah it's more than laser-guided hallelujah amen you'll have confidence in your weapon have confidence in your armor I'll Lou you say they only recognize the token now we understand that death is riding in this age amen we're not ignorant to that that 4/4 horse you know rider yo we know when the bride goes up the devil comes down as incarnate takes full control but all the mechanics of that ride is already riding Holly under the fourth seal it's already writing I'm in death and pestilence all yo deception everything's riding it's here upon the earth any of our brother Aaron says when the bride goes up that's when the the devil comes down is full incarnate I mean that's when the death really rides hallelujah but now in order for death not to strike us the token must be applied I mean when brother Bram he preached the seals amen you know and and but then he saw because really what a minister should do and brother Branham says is that he should be studying out the weak points of his congregation in order to help them there's what he says I mean so so after the preaching of the seals he said now the people have to apply the token he said he said that was the capping off of his whole ministry I mean that the token would be applied I mean there is more than just because even the Apostle Paul would say in first Corinthians 13 though I know all mysteries but have not charity I have nothing though I give my body to be burned give all my goods to the poor though I have not charity divine love I am nothing I mean so so we can no woman so he says in that scripture you can know all mysteries but yet without the Holy Ghost earned you the token being applied you're nothing I mean so he actually says you can actually understand all things but yet not have the Holy Ghost amen and it actually makes it very easy these days we have such programs we have you know the best ministry that's ever struck the earth is on the internet you can go listen you can watch you can actually learn there revelation but yet without the Holy Ghost amen so now that's why he yo he said that the preaching the token message was the capping off it was the really the apex of us of his ministry was now the blood had to be applied I mean that now is more than just learning but now the life of God had to come into the people hallelujah you say well I have the token well I trust after this you you hold it a far greater value amen then then before you received it amen so now so so he would say that now is the time because death is death is striking the land I mean unbelievers yo brother BAM said the worst devil that there is his unbelief more than epilepsy more than cancer more some horrible disease it is unbelief is the most wicked devil I mean and that is the greatest one we fight against I mean as unbelief I'll say also fear amen but we shouldn't fear nothing hallelujah when when when Israel was was under the blood and Goshen and it was dark amen you know the firstborn brother been dramatized it you know first we'll say daddy is everything okay because we heard Moses saying that I you know the firstborns going to die if the blast not applied it's eight don't worry Sam look look at the door and lintel we've done everything that the word has told us to do I mean the blood has been applied to the door and then till the Lambs been sacrificed I mean we've done everything all the Levin's been swept out of the house hallelujah why is there a house weeping why does it need to be a house weeping time because because like Jesus said about the parable of the woman that just had you know she was missing a coin and then in those days instead of a wedding ring they had like ten coins or something up and they're here and that was showing that they were married and if you lost one you were no you weren't living pure to your marriage vows no more so she lit a candle and she swept because she knew her husband was coming back I mean and she had to find the rest of her identification I mean she had to have that back where it was I mean that when her husband returns you'd say look I've been living true to you I've been waiting for you to return hallucis more than years - Haskell eNOS I I want all of my identification I mean so she lit a candle and she begin to sweep hallelujah and it should be the same thing with us I mean it's not just to cast things out that are ungodly out of our homes that's not the whole value of it but the whole value is to find our full identification and that full identification is being under the blood it's being under the token of the stain hallelujah that's why she swept and when she found that coin she rejoiced come I found what was lost what was part of me I have found it hallelujah should be the same thing with us if the devil's taking our joy if he's taking our peace if he's holding our plastic instance just get sweeping Amy because if he sweep through the word you'll find a man he was Bruce for my iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him by His stripes I'm healed he was wounded for my transgression I mean you'd be gonna see here's how piece it is broken down every wall hallelujah amen amen that's why you just get sweeping hallelujah amen that's what we need to do amen so now the father could say to the first one do not worry the Bloods been applied doesn't matter what you hear going on outside feels great there's a great cry that night you know I mean that your Egypt was mourning for their firstborn never been a cry like it for those and and and no doubt they could hear the death angel start from maybe one part of the nation come down through and hear the screams and the screams and the screams and and you know no doubt the first one me hey sure everything's gonna be okay yes we've done what the word has told us to do in faith we've applied the blood hallelujah and then the death angel passes over the house and the firstborn soul life and then they saw would have seen the true value thank you Lord that death is not struck our home thank you Lord that unbelief is not coming thank you Lord that you're the devil and and and and all of us Trix has not come in I mean because the blood has been applied hallelujah and then they and then under the strength of their lamb they left Egypt hallelujah and Caleb and Joshua under the strength of the lamb went all the way into the Promised Land hallelujah answers the same thing with you and I friends we got to see the value of applying the blood amen it works I meant a producers want it what God promises he doesn't backtrack on what he says or tries to diminish it later you know you know politicians make a lot of promises I'll do this and I'll do this and all do this then they get elected and based on those promises and they say oh we don't do that we can't do that we can't do that well cuz they backtrack and what they promise they can do God doesn't do that I mean what he promises he performs what he says in his word he does to the letter he does exactly he doesn't backtrack he doesn't diminish I mean he does exactly what he says hallelujah we just need to have confidence what he says and that's why we apply the blood Lord the death is writing in this age Amen by but I'm so glad that it cannot strike me it cannot strike those who are under the blue hallelujah amen and we should apply the blood and confidence not out of fear behalf confidence Lord you said this works and we're and we have many records of the blood being applied working hallelujah amen hallelujah that's why you should listen to testimony say God you still the same today I mean god you're alive today's you were back then hallelujah amen now in the rapture message 65 says God loaded his word out to each age and each and each one of those ages had to manifest that and he also for Dane men for that age to fulfill that word every time he allotted his word he allotted a man for it when he allotted Moses time he lighted Moses to it when he lauded a time for the son of God to be born he allotted him to it every age he's loaded men foreordained as the Bible said he said if God is infinite or mighty all-powerful omnipresent omniscient why he knowed all things from the beginning so he knowed and he says there's nothing out of cater so if God ordained this h-2b and a word for this age he ordained two people to receive that word I mean he ordained just as because what does it say I'm Malachi behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the grain dreadful day of the Lord when God had Malachi speak that Ford he knew who the woo you was hallelujah you were part of that word Amen you're part of that word why is that they should give you confidence Lord if you have predestinated a message for this in time to call a bride out you've also pre decided a bride to hear that message and be called out and become one with Christ hallelujah are not only that you produced a media fulfill it hallelujah I mean we should have great confidence God you've called me you've allotted your word to this age you knew what the devil would do in this age and you knew what you were doing this age and you put me on the endless age to manifest your word for this age hallelujah amen isn't that right we have to have confidence that's why this message found you we're not just this is not another Church not another denomination this is God calling as right that's what the message used to do it's a bridegroom call and it's got out to the all the ends of the earth to find his elected ones hallelujah and if you've been elected amen therefore you have to have great confidence now you are given the ability to overcome this age I mean you actually have the ability to overcome hallelujah it's a god-given ability it's not your ability it's his enablement I mean we know grace is the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life hallelujah amen so therefore here I am Lord you sent me to this age it's not a surprise you're born when you were born God knew who you would be who your parents grandparents great-grandparents whatever more he knew and he protected that natural lineage till you came I mean they're great Wars our forebears went through great famines great great pestilences and diseases others died but yours didn't why cuz God was prover he was preserving his seed for you to come I mean your parents had to be your parents no one else could be a parents they had to be your parents your grandparents had to be your grandparents no one else could do it hallelujah why cuz you're here now ain't mean you're here for a purpose you don't here to cower down and try and you know we are not survivors we're overcomers I mean every challenge as I said God loves a challenge he is not afraid of a challenge I mean he doesn't back up when the devil comes in like a flood he doesn't back up and say well I guess this is too hot to handle let's find someone else no he steps forth on the Battlefront I mean if he's our shield the shield is always in front of the one who's being shot at holy the shield bearer I mean no waste goes before the warrior hallelujah Amen I'll just you know and so we have to have confidence if he's our shield he's going before us he's here to take the blows he's here to take the shots hallelujah you know our God there was a girl I can't remember his name but there was this man and he fought in World War 1 and World War two and he lost and I lost the hand was was injured many times but incredible you know he had no fear and he was shot through the nickel he oh yo he survived many things but he led from the front and there's in World War one he's here yo he was like he wasn't a general but he was kind of down from a general and didn't say go into the battle boys he said come boys follow me so he was the first one over the top amen he led his men into victory he led his men into war as the same thing with God God doesn't sit back you know you know you know as a general just commanding his troops to go forward oh he says come follow me come into the fray hallelujah coming to the battle I mean I want to show you what I can do in the battle holy just like you wanted to show David I'll show you how I can kill a beer through you kill a lion through you kill a Goliath through you holy I want to show you what I can do in the battle and that's the same thing with you and I friends he wants to show you what he can do in the battle hallelujah amen that's why he doesn't shrink back he pushes on Satan you've come to challenge me good hallelujah I'm gonna show the power of my salvation I'm gonna show you what the blood can do hallelujah that's why we have have to have confidence and what God has made us to be I mean what this wood can do this word this message crew you know the same one that said let there be Sun Moon and stars spoke this message forth brother and said it wasn't me it's not my idea it's not my thoughts it says it's God's thoughts so I've had it has creative power in it hallelujah so the Creator spoke this word is that Alright ain't meant so now if this word has creative power nothing is greater than the Creator nothing can stand against the Creator the devil cannot create he can only prevent I mean that's why he takes your identity and try and perverts it when he tries to tell you you can never overcome you can never be victorious you miles will just accept your lot in life and sit back and accept it that's him perverting your identity and because the word says you're more than a conqueror through him that loved you holy oh we are overcomers that's our identity we are overcomers that's what we do that's what we're made to be hallelujah you take nature nature is governed by instinct a lion is always a lion amen it has an instinct as a lion it's a predator its aggressive you know doesn't it's not a rap no it's not a little bunny rabbit or a lamb amen it's a lion it's fish it can be raised by people but there's still that instinct in it and it can be triggered very easily it'll just go by their instinct and it'll be a lion because it's made to be a lion amen now we are not governed by instinct we're going by free will but if our free will is surrendered to God then what we're made to be will come out I mean we're made to be overcomers hallelujah that's what God has made you to be amen so if we're made to be overcomers we're going to have a challenge amen as I've said before an invincible army as an a bunch of people has just come out of basic training polished up weapons and and marching up and down the parade ground that's not invincible army they've never been tested they've never had they've never been in the battle they've never been under the pressure and the confusion of war they're never taken hits they've never been wounded they've never had battlefield experience but those that have had battlefield experience I mean an invincible army has fought battles and won amen and there's some generals in history that have never never lost a battle hallelujah and the one that really never lost it better was our King Jesus was our Lord Jesus Christ he has never ever lost a battle and he's not gonna lose the battle in this age why does the battle he fights all that the father has given me will come to me and all that country I'll no wise cast out I will not lose a part of myself he cannot it's impossible it's impossible for God to lose a part of himself like Adam the last act he did as God over the u.s. was try and redeem a part of himself he could not lose Eve because she was part of him hallelujah she was part of him I mean he had more ribs and evidently you can do an operation you can actually cut out a rubber a certain way it will grow back medical science has proven it but he had more ribs but he had no more feminist part of himself so he couldn't lose a part of himself it means he was willing to forfeit god ship over the earth for part of himself for the one he loved hallelujah that's like our Lord Jesus I mean he put on human flesh came down from the poles of glory became a man for you for love love brought him to the earth hallelujah love born to the earth I mean it speaks about an ax chapter one about how after his passion he was shown alive wet licious this just got x1 shall we they maybe we'll find a place to quit he says here now X X 1 & 3 to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs having seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God so after his passion he was sure yo yo he showed himself alive what was his passion his passion was redeeming you amen this is why I'm here upon the earth this is love has brought me here love for my last ones I need to redeem them back to myself hallelujah where his passion I mean he wasn't a robot Jesus wasn't a robot other scriptures be sad here now I'm sad they do this now there's no no he was human being God became a man to take on human battles to know what it was like to have mind battles to know what was like to be tempted he was tempted on all points yet without sin I mean so he knows what it's like to go through what we go through he knows what it's like to lose loss yeah I mean knows what it's like to lose loved ones he knows what it's like to be misunderstood he knows what it's like to be bullied he knows what it's like to be made fun of amen he understands what it's like because he went through it he experienced it amen but we are his passion hallelujah God you know love brought him here for you not just for even you know if it was just for wine it was for me you gotta think of it like that Jesus became man died on the Calvary as our sacrifice if it was just one he would have done it and if and when God prophesied behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the grand jurors will the Lord Amen if it was just for one God would have had his messenger in his hand and he we've gone through exactly the same things just for one because that's how much value God puts on part of himself hallelujah and that's how much value God puts upon you Callooh he can't lose that's the battle he cannot lose he can't lose a part of himself that's impossible hallelujah so we have to have confidence and I trust we do amen he there is value in applying the blood amen people could have everything they wore in the world but do they have peace no they're still empty that's why you look at the great stars of the world many of them on drugs broken families broken relationships no peace suicide whatever it may be why cuz they're not happy they have all the money they can do whatever they want but what do they have they actually have nothing amen but those who know the Lord hallelujah you can have nothing in the bank account but you can have everything holy why cuz you've got peace you know where you're going you know your sins have been taking care of your guilt your shame your iniquities whatever it may be has been washed in the blood of Jesus Christ he said Lord I could die right now I know where I'm going I am not afraid to walk through the portals of death because you are with me hallelujah you will take me to the other side and money can't buy that money can buy it has to be given but also has to be received so it's up to you I would just receive it say yes Lord Here I am Amen and apply the blood hallelujah I mean that's why we got confidence this message works this blood it works amen it was good in the first church age it's the good at the end hallelujah this word works amen we have to have confidence amen and so that's why I keep saying oh yeah and I'll say it again you have to look at the value of applying the blood the death angel can't come into my house he can't strike my family he can't get a whole them cuz the blood is applied halleluja halleluja and the blood is got to be applied to every heart as you you do not get him by association you get him by personal relationship with Jesus Christ hallelujah and that's why you know brother Graham says when the token is applied it makes you feel so relaxed now that relaxing doesn't mean well I'm just going to go live on a beach under a coconut tree for the rest of my life kind of attitude no it makes you so relaxed because you know your debts been paid I mean there's nothing held against you I mean you're protected I mean you have a shield hallelujah you're in the mighty fortress of our God nothing can harm you I mean anything that comes against you will be defeated hallelujah you will overcome all things why because you're under the blood you've applied the token the life of God is in you hallelujah makes you feel so relaxed why cuz the dev always comes along oh this could happen and this could happen and this could happen hold on no no the word says this will happen and this will happen and the sub conclusion is you're going to be on fire and I'm not going to be on fire you're going to burn I'm going to be dancing on streets of gold you weren't even being a memory anymore devil hallelujah you will not be remembered no more you're just going to be gone and I still will be hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen proving his word he says see it's it's by the true believers that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word now he had the believers the old cropper died off the unbelievers that said we couldn't take it he let every one of them perishes speaking of his role in the wilderness every one of them but the believers who was left Moses had been taken to glory and the unbelievers had perished in the wilderness and this was their children there was only two that crossed over and that was believers Caleb and Joshua they was the believers they was the one who crossed over that's the only way God can do it as by his believing children you believe that all right his believers was the one that done it he used him to cross over with see now I want you to notice he does that in every age he does it in every age by the same method he has to take believers and then in order to make believers to meet that word he's got a pre-dinner to that age you see he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did you get that did you feel it did you see it did you understand it that's what's happening today he predestinated it to the spy his foreknowledge so he proves his word through his believers and never ever let the devil make you think you and make believer an unbeliever do not let him rob you of what you have say God say Satan get out of my way I'm a believer in God he has joined himself to me by his blood he's made me a believer it doesn't matter what I feel how I think I mean no faith does not change faith is not based on feelings it's not based on even what I think about it I mean it's what I believe you may not understand it I mean the Apostles couldn't understand it when Jesus said eat my flesh drink my blood if you do not you have no life you know you know you don't have eternal life they couldn't explain it Jesus didn't explain it but they believed the one that was speaking had the words of eternal life and they stayed with him and it paid off hallelujah and it's the same thing with this message sure there's many things we may not understand you take even the Old Testament take the Book of Ezekiel do we understand it all no but do we believe it's the Word of God amen you take Jose you take any their prophecies do we understand it although if you understood it then you wouldn't need faith amen but walk by faith and not by sight we don't walk by mental understanding we'll walk by faith and the promise of God hallelujah and you know what opens thee you know what opens every door faith in the finished work of Calvary opens every door amen the same faith that you yes I promise is how do you apply the token to your family the same faith you believe for your own salvation use that same faith for your family it worked on you it'll work on them I mean it worked on you you got the Holy Ghost I mean you got change you got transform I haven't used that same faith on your children use that same faith on your family don't look at what they're doing it doesn't matter what they're doing I mean look at the promise Holly you look at the promise amen that's why you got to do I mean when the spies went into went into the Promised Land they're looking what the enemy was doing they have big cities they got big Giants they've got big armies how can we take it Caleb Caleb and Joshua they weren't looking what the enemy was doing they look at the promise of God we're more than able to take it because God's given it to us let's go take it hallelujah as the same thing with any promise of God don't look at the symptoms look at the promise I mean look at the promise of God and just hold that before yourself how they hold there before us have a walk into it I mean that's all you've got to do that's why Jesus said only believe all things are possible so if you only believe that's the only thing in the equation is your faith in the word it's not only believing how you feeling are you having a good day you having a good week you having a good month how much is in your bank account how bad is the sickness what's going on here you know no only belief only believe don't look at those things only belief all things are possible to them that belief and that's all we have to do only believe but that's the problem with this age we have too many choices others brother Aaron McGarry preached years ago youth can be said you know you know you know you go by something just I want to buy some jeans once upon a time it's your size now it's skinny boot cut straight whatever rips not ripped you know staying not staying what color you know there's all these choices it's not only buying jeans anymore there's too many choices and that's everything in life now what color shirt you want what kind of fabric you know cuts whatever whatever yo there's all these choices that's not helping me to be mean to only believe that means we only take the consideration of the word into account that's all we need to do hallelujah we call I'm just going to finish we're called overcome in this age we're here to overcome that's why this message has overcoming power in it as why it came to you and because God doesn't want it on books and tapes he wanted living though word has to be has to put on flesh hallelujah and you look at you look at the believers in Hebrews 11 I mean they died in faith they were in faith they will believe us that matter what outcome happened they were believers hallelujah Amen so we shouldn't just just only believe how do you know the death angel can't get you your own faith how do you know it doesn't get you you you're still believing I mean when Jesus said howbeit when the Son of Man come you know returns will he find faith upon the earth he's not meaning just a belief he's talking about a a faith in the whole body of Revelation of the word of God so he says will he find faith upon the earth and and your answer says yes Here I am however you've caused me to believe you will find faith when these parties have changed you will find a people that can be transformed amen I mean let's have some musicians please my friends don't don't shrink back don't be discouraged press the battle hallelujah have confidence the token works apply the blood amen we can't just sit and you know brother Brian sees many times now is the time don't just say you believe you ought to
