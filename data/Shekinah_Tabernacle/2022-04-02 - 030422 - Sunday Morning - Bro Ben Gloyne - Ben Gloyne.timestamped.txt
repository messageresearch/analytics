[54:04] it is who coming after me is preferred
[54:06] before me whose shoe latch it i am not
[54:09] worthy to unloose these things were done
[54:11] in
[54:13] beth abba
[54:14] beyond jordan where john was baptizing
[54:17] the next day john saith jesus coming
[54:19] unto him and he saith behold the lamb of
[54:21] god which taketh away the sin of the
[54:22] world this is he of whom i said after me
[54:25] cometh a man which is preferred before
[54:27] me for he was before me and i knew him
[54:30] not but that i should but sorry that he
[54:33] should be made manifest israel therefore
[54:36] am i am i come baptizing with water and
[54:38] john bear record saying i saw the spirit
[54:40] descending from heaven like a dove and
[54:42] it bowed upon him and i knew him not but
[54:45] he that sent me to baptize with water
[54:47] the same said unto me upon whom thou see
[54:49] shall see the spirit descending and
[54:51] remaining on him the same as which
[54:53] baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw
[54:56] and bear record this is the son of god
[54:59] again the next day after john stood and
[55:01] two of his disciples and looking upon
[55:03] jesus as he walketh he saith behold the
[55:06] lamb of god and the two disciples heard
[55:08] him speak and they followed jesus amen
[55:10] and we're going to go to hebrews
[55:12] chapter 12
[55:13] and just verses 1-3 here
[55:16] i'm sure these are very familiar
[55:18] scriptures
[55:19] to us all
[55:25] so hebrews 12 and verses 1 to 3 it says
[55:28] here
[55:32] he says wherefore seeing you also can
[55:35] pass about with so great a cloud of
[55:36] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[55:39] and the sin which does so easily beset
[55:41] us and let us run with patience the race
[55:43] that has set before us looking unto
[55:44] jesus the author and finisher of our
[55:46] faith who for the joy that was set
[55:48] before him endured the cross despising
[55:49] the shame and is set down at the right
[55:52] hand of the throne of god for consider
[55:54] him that endureth such contradiction of
[55:56] sinners against himself
[55:58] lest ye be wearied and faint in your
[56:00] minds
[56:01] amen let's just bow heads in a word of
[56:02] prayer this morning you if you ever need
[56:04] you just want to talk to the lord as
[56:05] we're praying or raise up your hand as
[56:07] however you feel to express yourself to
[56:09] the lord let's pray together gracious
[56:11] father we thank you lord that we can
[56:13] look
[56:14] we can look away to jesus as we sang the
[56:16] song here lord this morning thank you
[56:18] dear god we can see that crimson stream
[56:20] of blood that flows from calvary thank
[56:22] you lord that we can come into your
[56:24] presence this morning and just to give
[56:25] you praise and honor and glory and i
[56:28] just want to ask lord may you come once
[56:30] again father sometimes i feel like i say
[56:32] the same kind of prayer every service
[56:33] but lord we need you to come and anoint
[56:35] the word to our hearts lord we're not
[56:37] interested of some lecture or some man's
[56:40] idea lord i'm not even interested in my
[56:41] own ideas lord we want your word lord
[56:44] your thoughts oh god your intent lord
[56:46] jesus father to come and you'd fill our
[56:47] lives and lord you'd leave such a
[56:49] permanent impression on our souls lord
[56:52] by the seal of the baptism of the holy
[56:54] ghost i pray that you touch each life
[56:56] here lord jesus may you be with those
[56:58] who are streaming as well who couldn't
[56:59] make it today may be their portion
[57:01] father they're as they're the unseen uh

[57:12] well for those who are sick and body o

[57:22] lord you are their strength and their
[57:23] comfort we love you so much lord we just
[57:25] pray you'd have your way for your glory
[57:27] in jesus christ's name amen amen god
[57:30] bless you friends you may have your
[57:31] seats this morning so i'd like to uh
[57:34] continue on from a couple of sundays ago
[57:36] i was talking about look away to jesus
[57:38] and i want to continue about that just
[57:39] saying look
[57:41] um john the baptist here his whole his
[57:44] whole ministry had had had come down to
[57:46] this moment and this was the purpose of
[57:48] his of him coming to the earth was that
[57:50] he would identify the messiah now i know
[57:53] this is probably all very familiar but
[57:55] you know if we could just realize if we
[57:58] could look and see what god has done
[58:00] then we can gain the benefits of what he
[58:02] has done and it's very important that we
[58:04] look especially in this hour we need to
[58:06] look to jesus
[58:08] amen we need to look to him so john the
[58:10] baptist he was he was there to prepare
[58:12] the way of the lord as we read he would
[58:14] quote uh malachi and he'd say i am the
[58:17] fulfillment of that of that scripture
[58:19] and the thing is now brother brown would
[58:20] was saying the message look and you know
[58:22] in that message he's preaching after the
[58:24] seals are open he's trying to get the
[58:25] people to see something he says he says
[58:28] now he says i'm um he says but the voice
[58:30] that i'm trying to say to you this
[58:31] morning is like the writer of this
[58:33] epistle we believe to be paul which is
[58:34] saying looking for the coming of jesus
[58:36] christ the second time looking for him
[58:39] in order to do it you've got to see
[58:40] something before you can tell somebody
[58:42] else to look at what you're seeing i
[58:45] mean so so if you haven't seen it you
[58:47] can't tell but if you've seen him you
[58:49] can tell i mean so we've got to be very
[58:52] careful that we know what we're looking
[58:54] at because we can be looking at
[58:56] something but we can't see it you know
[58:57] there can be something in a picture uh
[58:59] it can be right in front of you but once
[59:01] you see it i mean if if you can't see it
[59:03] you can't see it but once you see it you
[59:05] cannot stop from seeing it
[59:07] amen you know so it's got to be you know
[59:09] i remember um
[59:11] years ago now well i don't know how many
[59:13] years ago i was up in the far north of
[59:15] brother malcolm one i went off as a
[59:17] gentlemanly uh pig hunt and um we were
[59:20] on our way back any any and and then
[59:23] across the you know a couple of fields
[59:25] and in this bush by this bush there was
[59:26] this white dog sitting there it was one
[59:28] of the neighbors or something he says
[59:30] look can't you see that dog and i
[59:31] couldn't see it you know but it was
[59:33] right there he said no no look see that
[59:35] dog right there then i saw it and then
[59:36] once i saw it i couldn't unsee it
[59:38] because i saw it and it's the same thing
[59:39] with the lord today i mean you can look
[59:42] at the you can look at the picture but
[59:43] but but when the lord opens your eyes to
[59:45] see it then you look then you're really
[59:47] looking amen and i believe that in god's
[59:50] great sovereign grace and spirit is is
[59:52] here i mean it's in our lives it's
[59:54] working that we can look
[59:57] we can look to jesus now john we know he
[1:00:00] he he he was there to identify the
[1:00:03] messiah
[1:00:04] and his and that was the purpose of him
[1:00:06] being there now he had to be shown by
[1:00:10] god
[1:00:11] what he was to point out
[1:00:13] i mean so he said you know the lord told
[1:00:15] him that the one he sees a spirit come
[1:00:17] you land upon and descend like a dove
[1:00:19] that's the messiah and then so because
[1:00:22] jesus looked like anyone else he didn't
[1:00:23] have any kind of fancy robe he didn't
[1:00:25] look any different he looked like just a
[1:00:27] common man you know even the bible would
[1:00:29] say that you know when we see him
[1:00:31] there's nothing in him that we would
[1:00:32] desire him he just looked like a common
[1:00:34] normal man so john would john would see
[1:00:37] uh
[1:00:38] in a vision he would see that happening
[1:00:39] of the spirit coming down descending
[1:00:41] upon the lord and say behold the lamb of
[1:00:42] god that takes away the sin of the world
[1:00:44] and so those who are looking for who
[1:00:47] who john was pointing out would see the
[1:00:50] one he's identifying amen and it said
[1:00:53] that those two disciples followed the
[1:00:54] lord jesus so in order to
[1:00:57] to to to see you have to be able to look
[1:01:00] now this may i hope this doesn't sound
[1:01:03] like a circular thing but when i'm
[1:01:04] saying you know when people say look
[1:01:06] what i'm talking about they're saying
[1:01:07] can you see can you understand can you
[1:01:09] comprehend
[1:01:10] and even that word which says looking
[1:01:12] under jesus means to consider
[1:01:14] attentively to look
[1:01:16] i mean so john pointed the lord out and
[1:01:19] then and then people began to follow the
[1:01:20] lord now he had to look in order to
[1:01:23] point
[1:01:24] if he wasn't looking he couldn't point
[1:01:26] him out
[1:01:27] now it's very easy to point out things
[1:01:30] that aren't important in life
[1:01:32] you know there's a lot of things we
[1:01:34] could actually if we look at the grand
[1:01:35] scale of the world there's a lot of
[1:01:36] things that aren't important
[1:01:38] really you know when you bring it into
[1:01:40] consideration with eternity and what
[1:01:41] god's doing upon the earth there's some
[1:01:44] things that aren't really important the
[1:01:45] price of cucumbers isn't really
[1:01:46] important the price of tomatoes you know
[1:01:49] the price of meat it's really not that
[1:01:50] important i mean sure on on the scale
[1:01:54] it's important in terms of food prices
[1:01:55] have gone up but in the grand scheme
[1:01:57] does it really matter i mean it's just
[1:01:59] the conditions of the time we're living
[1:02:01] in so we can point those things out but
[1:02:03] you know we we should be pointing out
[1:02:05] the important thing you know brother
[1:02:06] graham says in one message i couldn't
[1:02:08] quite find the quote but the paraphrase
[1:02:10] he says you know we can easily spend so
[1:02:12] much time telling people what not to do
[1:02:14] but we should really tell them what they
[1:02:16] should be doing which is to believe on
[1:02:17] the lord jesus christ and thine of thy
[1:02:19] house shall be saved so so paul paul
[1:02:22] said that to the philippian jailer
[1:02:23] because the philippians said what shall
[1:02:25] i do
[1:02:26] he says believe in the lord jesus christ
[1:02:27] and thine in thy house in other words he
[1:02:29] said look to the lord the one we've been
[1:02:31] singing about the one we've been
[1:02:32] testifying about in the jail look to him
[1:02:34] and and and you will get i mean what he
[1:02:36] wants to give you he will give you
[1:02:38] salvation for you and and and for your
[1:02:40] house so the apostle paul told them to
[1:02:43] look
[1:02:44] now
[1:02:46] the believer i believe the lord's given
[1:02:49] us sight that we can see by faith
[1:02:52] amen now
[1:02:53] really what you can see
[1:02:55] shows where you're living
[1:02:57] now brother brown would uh parallel the
[1:02:59] the um
[1:03:01] the tabernacle in the wilderness and he
[1:03:03] says it's you know you know it's
[1:03:05] it's like the three areas of the
[1:03:06] tabernacle is the three stages of the
[1:03:08] christian walk
[1:03:09] first is you come into the outer court
[1:03:11] where the where the sacrifice was
[1:03:13] offered okay so so you're justified by
[1:03:15] faith it's good you've come and it's
[1:03:17] good you've been justified by faith but
[1:03:19] don't stop there we have to go into the
[1:03:20] holy of holies and then and then once
[1:03:22] that you go into the inner court where
[1:03:24] the whether with the with the shoe bread
[1:03:26] is and there's the menorah there's the
[1:03:28] seven golden candlesticks all those
[1:03:30] things you know that's
[1:03:32] that sanctification it's good to go in
[1:03:34] there but you don't want to go and you
[1:03:36] you just don't want to stay there you've
[1:03:38] got to go into the holy of holies and
[1:03:39] the presence of god into the baptism of
[1:03:41] the holy ghost
[1:03:42] and because the thing is
[1:03:44] when you go into the
[1:03:46] inner court there
[1:03:48] you're living by an artificial light
[1:03:50] you're living by a church light
[1:03:53] now
[1:03:54] brother braham says and if i can find it
[1:03:57] maybe i should have just stuck with my
[1:03:58] notes being printed out but he says here
[1:03:59] he says see so it really shows where
[1:04:01] you're living in that area i mean in
[1:04:04] those places it shows your experience so
[1:04:06] if you're in the arctic court there's no
[1:04:08] roof over your heads if it rains you get
[1:04:10] wet if it's cold you get cold if it's
[1:04:12] sunny you get sunburned it's all based
[1:04:15] on the atmosphere of the environment of
[1:04:17] the world dictates to you your
[1:04:18] experience
[1:04:20] right but if you go into the inner court
[1:04:21] you've got a roof over your head
[1:04:23] but you've got to keep putting oil into
[1:04:25] the into the cold um seven golden
[1:04:27] candlesticks to see
[1:04:29] it's man-made light it's man-made effort
[1:04:32] right but then once you go through the
[1:04:34] veil into the holiest of all you don't
[1:04:37] have to pour any oil in the shekinah
[1:04:38] glory of god is there amen life comes
[1:04:41] forth he you don't it's it's not you
[1:04:44] trying to be the christian it's him
[1:04:45] pulsating out of you him being the
[1:04:47] christian
[1:04:48] right so
[1:04:49] so it really depends what you look at is
[1:04:52] where you live he would say in the inner
[1:04:54] vale in 1956 he says now you've seen
[1:04:58] miss jones over there who's supposed to
[1:04:59] be a christian
[1:05:01] do something wasn't right you say well i
[1:05:03] wonder if there's anything to it see
[1:05:05] you've still got your eyes on miss jones
[1:05:07] see you're still walking with artificial
[1:05:09] light
[1:05:10] so if we look at well brother so-and-so
[1:05:12] did this sister so-and-so did this this
[1:05:14] church said this this preacher did this
[1:05:16] and it dictates to us our christian walk
[1:05:18] and i wonder if there's anything to it
[1:05:19] is it really true you know you're still
[1:05:21] living in an artificial light i mean but
[1:05:24] if you go beyond that that our christian
[1:05:26] walk shouldn't be based on what each
[1:05:28] other's doing
[1:05:29] right our christian walk is up and us in
[1:05:31] god
[1:05:32] us and the lord jesus right so so it
[1:05:34] doesn't matter what's going on around us
[1:05:36] sure it will affect us if we have a
[1:05:37] heart we will be burdened if something
[1:05:39] you know someone's struggling or there's
[1:05:41] pain or hurt or you know because we're
[1:05:42] not robots right we do care for one
[1:05:44] another church yet amen i hope right so
[1:05:47] but you know it that shouldn't push us
[1:05:49] off the journey
[1:05:50] right we should just keep going on so we
[1:05:53] don't want to
[1:05:54] um our victory should not be based on
[1:05:56] how others are going our victory should
[1:05:59] be based on who the lord is and what
[1:06:01] he's done
[1:06:02] so but the man who walked in behind the
[1:06:05] holiest of holies it didn't matter
[1:06:07] whether the sun shined or not didn't
[1:06:09] matter whether candles burned or not he
[1:06:10] lived in the light of the shekinah glory
[1:06:12] where the pillar of fire dwelt
[1:06:14] under the interlock winds of the wings
[1:06:16] of the cherubim and all the time he's
[1:06:17] walking in the perfect light and
[1:06:19] fellowship he didn't look to the outside
[1:06:21] to the rainy days there was never a
[1:06:22] rainy day never a doubt never a time
[1:06:24] when he was hungry for god because in
[1:06:26] him was stored up the manner of god the
[1:06:28] word built up unto a righteous
[1:06:30] foundation he had not to worry no more
[1:06:34] certainly not he was inside the world
[1:06:36] was outside
[1:06:38] that's what the church needs today is an
[1:06:39] experience that will take them
[1:06:42] under the shekinah glory where all the
[1:06:43] curtains will fall and hide the man from
[1:06:45] the things of the world till you live in
[1:06:47] the presence of god and under his great
[1:06:48] power under the interlock wings of the
[1:06:50] holy ghost and in the cross you'll stand
[1:06:53] and the cross don't become a burden
[1:06:55] anymore it picks up wings and flies away
[1:06:58] i mean i like how he puts that i mean so
[1:07:01] if we if we're looking to what each
[1:07:03] other's doing and that and that and that
[1:07:05] affects our walk i say let's go to the
[1:07:07] shekinah glory
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:10] so john pointed out the lamb of god now
[1:07:12] the reason he pointed him out is because
[1:07:14] his his ministry was for the people to
[1:07:17] follow the messiah for the people to
[1:07:19] become one with the messiah and receive
[1:07:20] eternal life so he was actually saying
[1:07:22] look at him he is the fount of eternal
[1:07:25] life he's the lamb of god that will take
[1:07:26] away the sin of the world i mean so it's
[1:07:29] the same thing today you know we have to
[1:07:32] we have to look
[1:07:33] and if we look
[1:07:35] by faith then we'll get what he wants to
[1:07:36] give us
[1:07:38] amen like he would say here with
[1:07:40] um um and and second second corinthians
[1:07:43] three he says now the spirit i mean the
[1:07:46] lord is that spirit and where the spirit
[1:07:47] of the lord is there is liberty
[1:07:49] but we all with uh with open face
[1:07:52] beholding as in the glass the glory of
[1:07:54] the lord are changed into the same image
[1:07:56] from glory to glory even as by the
[1:07:58] spirit of the lord so he's saying we are
[1:08:00] looking
[1:08:02] amen when the lord when the lord takes
[1:08:04] away i mean takes away the veil that you
[1:08:06] can see you are looking at something now
[1:08:08] where it's not obscured anymore the word
[1:08:10] is not obscured the lord is not is he
[1:08:12] three or two or one or you know all
[1:08:14] these questions they're gone
[1:08:16] because you see him as he is
[1:08:18] right you see that it's not man's ideas
[1:08:20] that put the bible together but this is
[1:08:22] the word of god this is god in print
[1:08:23] form amen and then so now you're looking
[1:08:26] you're looking at the lord and now
[1:08:28] you're being changed into what you're
[1:08:30] looking at
[1:08:31] amen because now if we can look by faith
[1:08:34] to what he has done and what he is doing
[1:08:36] then the power of what he has done can
[1:08:38] flow into our lives and manifest in us i
[1:08:40] mean you know that's why john pointed
[1:08:42] out the messiah says behold the lamb of
[1:08:43] god what was he pointing out you walk
[1:08:45] with him and he'll give you a pentecost
[1:08:47] you'll walk with him he'll give you
[1:08:48] eternal life it's in him he wants to
[1:08:51] give it to you but look on him
[1:08:53] amen because remember there's no there's
[1:08:55] no virtue and worry
[1:08:57] worry hasn't helped anyone since adam
[1:08:59] till now worry has helped no one if you
[1:09:02] look to worry if you look to anxiety if
[1:09:04] you look to problems that won't help you
[1:09:06] i remember faith can deliver
[1:09:09] that's why you should look to faith i
[1:09:10] mean you should look away from worry be
[1:09:12] safe but it's so real yes it is real you
[1:09:14] know we can't just bury our heads in the
[1:09:16] sand we're not a bunch of ostriches that
[1:09:18] just bury their head in the sand right
[1:09:20] sure this worry sure there's trouble
[1:09:22] we're in a time of trouble we're not
[1:09:23] exempt from trouble but we can look on
[1:09:26] him i mean he can give us strength to to
[1:09:28] to go through the trouble i mean to go
[1:09:31] through the anguish it doesn't mean just
[1:09:32] because you feel troubled it doesn't
[1:09:34] mean that you're not an overcomer
[1:09:36] right but you're overcoming by what you
[1:09:38] look to
[1:09:39] i mean by by your source of strength as
[1:09:42] david said my help cometh from the lord
[1:09:44] i mean he had a lot of trouble he had a
[1:09:46] lot of pressure and trouble going on but
[1:09:49] he knew who his source of strength was
[1:09:51] and he looked to the right one he looked
[1:09:53] to the one who gave him the promise
[1:09:55] you're gonna sit on the throne he looked
[1:09:56] to the one that that that the spirit of
[1:09:58] god you know the anointing that was
[1:10:00] poured upon him by a vindicated prophet
[1:10:02] he looked to the one who gave him the
[1:10:03] promise it wasn't samuel the you know
[1:10:06] that gave him the promise it was god
[1:10:07] himself so he looked to him amen and if
[1:10:10] we can look to the lord who said you're
[1:10:12] going in a rapture you'll be made in my
[1:10:14] image amen you will amen you have
[1:10:16] eternal life in you by the baptism of
[1:10:18] the holy ghost that my blood is enough
[1:10:20] amen that you are here you're more than
[1:10:23] able to overcome this age because of
[1:10:24] what what i have done we've got to look
[1:10:27] to him amen
[1:10:28] amen now now by saying this i'm not
[1:10:31] saying you're not looking i just want to
[1:10:32] encourage you just look
[1:10:34] amen look to your source of strength i
[1:10:36] mean we need him more than ever before
[1:10:39] in this age we need god more than any
[1:10:41] other age i believe because this world
[1:10:42] is so much darker it's so much nastier
[1:10:45] it's so much more terrible trouble on
[1:10:47] every hand but yet our god is stronger
[1:10:49] our god is greater our god is still
[1:10:51] capable amen he's not panicking he knows
[1:10:54] exactly what he's doing but we've got to
[1:10:55] look to him
[1:10:57] amen and but i think we can rejoice this
[1:10:59] morning he's made us that we can look
[1:11:02] i mean the scribes and pharisees looked
[1:11:04] at the same jesus as as those disciples
[1:11:07] you know and they said well he's
[1:11:08] beelzebub he's just you know he's a
[1:11:10] fortune teller one bible whatever i mean
[1:11:13] they looked at the same one that the
[1:11:14] disciples looked at but peter looked at
[1:11:16] him and said but to whom shall we go you
[1:11:18] have the you alone have the words of
[1:11:19] eternal life because he had faith he was
[1:11:22] given grace to look
[1:11:24] amen aren't you glad for that grace this
[1:11:26] morning
[1:11:27] hallelujah amen that because what we're
[1:11:29] looking into will transform us or deform
[1:11:32] us
[1:11:32] this world is a bunch of it's a
[1:11:35] deformation
[1:11:37] not a restoration it's a deforming world
[1:11:40] it wants to take our identity from us
[1:11:42] even our gender anything just wants to
[1:11:44] make it all grey and the same amen but
[1:11:46] but god wants to transform us into his
[1:11:48] image
[1:11:49] amen but it depends what you're looking
[1:11:50] at amen so i say if you're looking at
[1:11:52] something that deforms you that troubles
[1:11:54] you that weakens your faith you're
[1:11:56] looking at the wrong thing amen but if
[1:11:58] you're looking at the lord amen it'll
[1:12:00] he'll build your faith whoever feels
[1:12:02] encouraged you just read a couple of
[1:12:04] promises and you feel your faith just
[1:12:06] shoot up and praise the lord i can i can
[1:12:08] press the battle why because the lord is
[1:12:10] because you're actually drawing strength
[1:12:12] amen from because you're looking at the
[1:12:15] right thing
[1:12:16] hallelujah now
[1:12:18] as i'm sure as we go along in our
[1:12:20] christian walk we begin to realize that
[1:12:23] you know our walk becomes more by faith
[1:12:25] than by sight
[1:12:26] as we walk with god because god wants to
[1:12:28] mature us right and and but but there's
[1:12:31] a victory in maturity because we can
[1:12:33] look back and say what we once did we
[1:12:35] don't do no more well who did that to us
[1:12:37] it was god it wasn't just because we got
[1:12:39] older and became more set in our ways no
[1:12:41] that can be actually a hindrance
[1:12:43] you know you can't teach an old dog new
[1:12:45] tricks they say
[1:12:47] but you know if you can look back and
[1:12:48] say you know you can see the things i
[1:12:50] once did the things i once saw my
[1:12:52] attitudes have changed everything who
[1:12:53] did that it wasn't yourself it was god
[1:12:56] i mean so so there's a victory in
[1:12:58] maturity because the more mature we
[1:13:00] become now when i talk about maturity
[1:13:03] here i'm not talking about a physical
[1:13:04] maturity i'm talking about a spiritual
[1:13:06] maturity so you can be 12 years old and
[1:13:09] you can be the most mature christian
[1:13:10] there is
[1:13:12] amen it's not about age oh no i'm fully
[1:13:15] no no it's it's spiritual maturity i'm
[1:13:16] talking about right so so the more
[1:13:18] mature we become in the lord i believe
[1:13:21] the more we walk by faith and not by
[1:13:23] sight
[1:13:24] i mean so so our faith actually
[1:13:26] overrides our five senses more and more
[1:13:28] every day now abraham looked one day
[1:13:32] remember god told him come out of this
[1:13:35] land i'll give you a new land and so he
[1:13:37] looked at the one that was talking to
[1:13:39] him and he followed that voice
[1:13:41] we know it was the voice of the lord now
[1:13:44] he came to a point in his life where his
[1:13:46] faith overrode his conditions now you
[1:13:49] think about abraham he was 99 years old
[1:13:52] cyril was about 90. but yet the promise
[1:13:54] was was was was hanging over them you're
[1:13:57] going to have the promised son they were
[1:13:59] living under that yo that promise was
[1:14:01] theirs it wasn't for someone else it was
[1:14:02] them i mean when you can see your name
[1:14:04] in the word it's not just for someone
[1:14:06] else it's for you it changes your whole
[1:14:08] life i mean it's abraham because he
[1:14:10] looked at the one giving the promise
[1:14:12] and he began to realize that that the
[1:14:15] one that's told me to look on him
[1:14:18] the one who's saying look on me amen he
[1:14:20] realized the one who gave the promise
[1:14:22] was able to fulfill the promise now if
[1:14:24] you look at abraham's circumstances
[1:14:26] it was literally it was impossible and
[1:14:29] this is not stretching the imagination
[1:14:31] at all it was literally impossible for
[1:14:33] them to have the child
[1:14:35] they he was 99 years old cyril was about
[1:14:38] 90 you know they were well up in age
[1:14:39] well past you know menopause had come
[1:14:41] and gone for sarah all those things that
[1:14:43] happened they couldn't have children
[1:14:45] even from when they were young so he
[1:14:47] felt old
[1:14:49] he looked old
[1:14:51] he would have sounded old
[1:14:52] i mean he would have probably thought
[1:14:54] old well how do you think old well i
[1:14:56] mean like even now
[1:14:58] the last time i ever tried to play
[1:14:59] indoor soccer you know i pulled muscles
[1:15:01] just warming up
[1:15:03] and that wasn't that long ago i'm not
[1:15:04] old but a few years before that you just
[1:15:07] run and you jump and yeah you don't
[1:15:09] think about you're not worried about
[1:15:10] pulling anything you know but
[1:15:12] you're not bad i did some damage you
[1:15:14] know
[1:15:15] anyway but and and that was just to
[1:15:17] myself so i realized so so you're gonna
[1:15:19] think now hold on can i you know
[1:15:21] can i do this you're making a thing old
[1:15:23] you don't feel old but you i mean you
[1:15:25] and yourself you still feel young but
[1:15:26] you gotta you realize this thing
[1:15:28] man what's happened to the guy
[1:15:31] where can i get a warrant of fitness
[1:15:32] where can i you know i need to trade up
[1:15:34] or something you know what i mean i need
[1:15:36] some parts replaced so the older you get
[1:15:38] the more you think you know can i do
[1:15:40] this like i used to so he would have
[1:15:42] thought old
[1:15:43] he looked old he felt all this he spoke
[1:15:46] old
[1:15:47] so all of his five senses
[1:15:50] declared he was old and sarah she looked
[1:15:53] old she sounded old she acted old right
[1:15:55] but then as as he walked with god his
[1:15:59] faith overrode
[1:16:00] the his own present condition
[1:16:03] right his faith overrode it amen so so
[1:16:07] his present condition did not hinder the
[1:16:09] revelation that god had put in his heart
[1:16:12] that they were going to have the
[1:16:12] promised son it did not hinder it amen
[1:16:15] because the apostle paul would speak in
[1:16:17] romans and he would say that abraham
[1:16:21] when when when he would write the
[1:16:22] commentary of abraham's life he says
[1:16:25] that is as it is written i have made
[1:16:27] thee a father of many nations before him
[1:16:29] whom he believed even god who quickened
[1:16:31] the dead and caught those things which
[1:16:33] be not as though they were who against
[1:16:35] hope believed in hope that he might
[1:16:37] become the father of many nations
[1:16:39] according to that which was spoken so
[1:16:41] shall thy seed be and being not weak in
[1:16:44] faith he considered not his own body now
[1:16:46] dead when he was about a hundred years
[1:16:48] years old neither yet the deadness of
[1:16:50] sarah's womb he staggered not at the
[1:16:53] promise of god through unbelief but was
[1:16:54] strong in faith giving glory to god and
[1:16:57] being fully persuaded that that what he
[1:16:59] had promised he was also able to perform
[1:17:02] amen so abraham came to the spot in his
[1:17:05] life he didn't stagger
[1:17:08] he laughed you know
[1:17:09] their son was called isaac not just
[1:17:11] because sarah laughed abraham laughed he
[1:17:14] laughed in the prince of god god came
[1:17:16] down supernatural being came down and
[1:17:18] said you're gonna have the promised son
[1:17:20] and there's abraham laughing
[1:17:22] and the prince of god saying how can
[1:17:23] this be
[1:17:25] but there came a point where the
[1:17:26] revelation that was deposited in
[1:17:28] overrode
[1:17:30] his his unbelief
[1:17:32] amen and and so he came to a point where
[1:17:34] he staggered none of the promise of god
[1:17:36] now i pray when god writes about my life
[1:17:39] this will be my
[1:17:40] eulogy
[1:17:42] he didn't stagger at my promise he was
[1:17:44] strong in faith giving glory to god and
[1:17:46] it was fully persuaded what he had
[1:17:48] promised he was also able to perform i
[1:17:51] mean that's what i pray the lord would
[1:17:52] say about you and i
[1:17:54] amen we may abraham had his ups and
[1:17:56] downs sure but he came to a spot where
[1:17:58] he didn't stag him
[1:17:59] hallelujah why because he was beholding
[1:18:02] he was looking
[1:18:04] at the one who could give him strength
[1:18:07] amen he was able to look and he saw that
[1:18:10] god was not just a god that led him to
[1:18:11] the promised land but he looked and saw
[1:18:13] that god is also the strength giver amen
[1:18:16] our trust is the same thing with you and
[1:18:18] i he's not just the one who saves our
[1:18:20] souls but he gives us strength i mean he
[1:18:23] gives us strength that the promise can
[1:18:24] become manifested in our lives
[1:18:27] as as as the lord would appear we know
[1:18:30] that he appeared to abraham in many
[1:18:32] different names but it was the same god
[1:18:34] wasn't a different god it was the same
[1:18:36] god and so in genesis 17 and 1 it says
[1:18:39] the lord appeared to abraham when
[1:18:41] abraham was 99 years old now if you go
[1:18:44] down into the hebrew that word lord if
[1:18:46] you go down to the root meaning of the
[1:18:47] word it means
[1:18:49] which is al-shaddai
[1:18:51] which is which is the breasted god like
[1:18:53] a woman that breast feeds a baby the
[1:18:55] strength giver
[1:18:57] amen so here was a um abram before he
[1:18:59] became abraham 99 years old but god says
[1:19:02] now i'm going to reveal myself to you as
[1:19:04] the strength giver as the life giver so
[1:19:06] now when i call you you're going to look
[1:19:09] upon me as the strength giver because
[1:19:11] remember we need to look and when we
[1:19:12] look as god reveals himself we receive
[1:19:15] what he wants to give us
[1:19:16] i mean so he was a str strength giver
[1:19:19] like a baby
[1:19:20] you know a baby nursing from a mother's
[1:19:22] breast drawing strength and growing
[1:19:25] he says here this is a from from jehovah
[1:19:28] jireh he says and he appeared him in the
[1:19:29] name of god almighty and the hebrews el
[1:19:32] shaddai which probably means the breast
[1:19:33] of a woman said abraham i'm appearing to
[1:19:35] you now as the breasted one i am the
[1:19:37] mother you're old your strength is all
[1:19:39] gone but i'm the breasted god in other
[1:19:41] words your strength is gone but i am the
[1:19:43] one who can nurse you back to strength
[1:19:45] again
[1:19:46] god almighty if he was that to abraham
[1:19:49] he's got to be that to abraham's seed
[1:19:51] for the same promises no matter how sick
[1:19:53] you are how far you've gone lay hold of
[1:19:55] god's eternal promises and nurse your
[1:19:58] life back again how far you're in sin
[1:20:00] how you know you may be a prostitute
[1:20:02] from the street but that same promise is
[1:20:04] to you if you'll dare to take hold of
[1:20:07] god i mean so he's saying now that the
[1:20:09] same god that gave strength to abraham
[1:20:11] to fulfill his promises in the word is
[1:20:14] the same one if we draw strength from
[1:20:16] his word we'll we'll change our bodies i
[1:20:19] mean if we realize actually our god has
[1:20:21] not just given us promises that now we
[1:20:23] have to fulfill them in our own strength
[1:20:25] but he gives us the promises and then he
[1:20:27] gives us the strength to fulfill those
[1:20:28] promises then because salvation is of
[1:20:30] the lord it's got nothing to do with you
[1:20:32] and i god gives the ability to fulfill
[1:20:34] his word that's why the holy ghost is so
[1:20:37] vital because it enables the believer to
[1:20:39] fulfill his word i mean this is not us
[1:20:41] trying to be christians in our own
[1:20:42] strength this is not us trying to be
[1:20:44] message believers in our own strength
[1:20:45] and keep the word our own strength no
[1:20:47] it's our surrendering to god and letting
[1:20:49] him come and fill us with his goodness
[1:20:50] with his word that he lives out of us
[1:20:53] amen but it's so important because the
[1:20:55] more a promise can linger that's the
[1:20:57] more important that you nurse off that
[1:20:58] promise i mean abraham had 25 years to
[1:21:01] nurse off you know god's strength you
[1:21:03] could say because the promise had
[1:21:04] lingered for 25 years but he nursed
[1:21:07] strength from the lord so the more
[1:21:09] something seems to linger don't give up
[1:21:11] don't quit i mean just keep nursing
[1:21:14] strength from god almighty amen because
[1:21:16] in his time he wants to fulfill it you
[1:21:19] know what kind of character would we
[1:21:21] have if god gave us everything like this
[1:21:23] what kind of character would we have
[1:21:25] amen because remember they that wait
[1:21:27] upon the lord shall renew their strength
[1:21:29] we wait for god's timing yeah we want
[1:21:31] everything like this this is an instant
[1:21:32] age you know you do a google search and
[1:21:34] how it tells you how many hits and how
[1:21:37] long it took you to you know get them
[1:21:38] all those things and it's all instant
[1:21:40] but with god god's timing's different
[1:21:42] than our timing but he wants to give us
[1:21:44] the character that we can wait upon him
[1:21:46] and the more we wait upon him the more
[1:21:48] strength we should have and the more
[1:21:49] rejoicing we should have in our and our
[1:21:51] being because god is in control but we
[1:21:53] just got to draw strength from him it
[1:21:55] depends who you're looking to abraham
[1:21:57] was looking to god
[1:21:59] amen brother brown would say there
[1:22:00] before before the visitation in genesis
[1:22:03] 18. you're on the plains of memory you
[1:22:05] know he said that even your brother
[1:22:07] brown would dramatize it he'd say well
[1:22:09] you know sarah was a bit fussy
[1:22:11] and but then abraham brother braham said
[1:22:13] kept the spiritual atmosphere around him
[1:22:15] why because he'd been drawing strength
[1:22:17] he means drawing strength god had
[1:22:19] visited many times but now was coming
[1:22:21] the season where remember abraham had
[1:22:23] had his visitation
[1:22:25] but now sarah needed her visitation
[1:22:27] genesis 18 was actually sarah's
[1:22:29] visitation that the church would receive
[1:22:31] a revelation that that that she could
[1:22:34] have the promised son amen just like us
[1:22:36] the church has been waiting two thousand
[1:22:38] years for the you know you're for us to
[1:22:39] meet the lord in the air but now god has
[1:22:41] sent a visitation to the earth through
[1:22:43] malachi 4. i mean that same ministry has
[1:22:45] come back again to turn our hearts back
[1:22:47] to the original faith that we can
[1:22:49] receive strength amen that we can
[1:22:51] receive the promised son
[1:22:52] hallelujah so so abraham kept the
[1:22:54] spiritual atmosphere around him how do
[1:22:56] you do that well a soft answer turns
[1:22:58] away wrath
[1:22:59] i mean don't get caught up in the
[1:23:00] nitty-gritty of the argument you just go
[1:23:02] beyond it
[1:23:03] amen you be loving you'd be kind you
[1:23:06] know
[1:23:07] you know
[1:23:09] be the peacemaker in the family
[1:23:11] don't join sides just be the peacemaker
[1:23:14] look beyond the situation
[1:23:16] you know don't be caught up in the will
[1:23:18] this happened listen no look beyond it
[1:23:20] right when you know
[1:23:22] our home shouldn't be parliament
[1:23:24] whereas a debating chamber which seems
[1:23:26] to be full of kindergarten kids
[1:23:29] you know it shouldn't be oh there's the
[1:23:30] opposition yeah i remember one of my
[1:23:32] maths classes as in
[1:23:34] uh year
[1:23:36] year 11 if that's it now you know we
[1:23:38] were seated based on score of test
[1:23:41] results and there was the government
[1:23:43] started the prime minister was the head
[1:23:45] of the class then went to the opposition
[1:23:46] then the bottom was the greens
[1:23:49] so you can see what that teacher thought
[1:23:50] of them but anyway it was funny but uh
[1:23:52] yeah but you know but out
[1:23:54] our our family shouldn't be like that
[1:23:56] well madame speaker did it mr speaker
[1:23:58] did it literally you know no no no hold
[1:24:00] on they should be peaceful
[1:24:02] the only opposition we have is the devil
[1:24:04] and he's not welcome in my my chamber
[1:24:08] amen so you know be the peacemaker
[1:24:12] so
[1:24:14] abraham drew strength from the lord and
[1:24:17] remember he if he was our shadow back
[1:24:19] then he's still the same today because
[1:24:21] he hasn't changed so we can draw
[1:24:23] strength
[1:24:24] amen we can be nourished back to health
[1:24:26] again if we just draw from him he's
[1:24:28] still our shadow tonight
[1:24:30] amen even even in genesis 35 when the
[1:24:33] lord appeared to jacob again
[1:24:35] um when it says in god appeared to jacob
[1:24:38] again
[1:24:39] there
[1:24:40] he's actually revealing himself in the
[1:24:41] same way to jacob so that we know it was
[1:24:44] abraham isaac and jacob so as a future
[1:24:45] generation the lord appeared to himself
[1:24:47] as the strength giver so to me that
[1:24:49] shows that he's the same yesterday today
[1:24:51] and forever i can't encourage you enough
[1:24:53] if you need spiritual strength draw
[1:24:56] strength from him draw strength from the
[1:24:58] word
[1:24:59] amen don't be don't don't don't draw
[1:25:01] strength on social media don't draw
[1:25:03] strength from just mindless scrolling
[1:25:05] what they used to call it with covert
[1:25:07] doom scrolling or gloom scrolling just
[1:25:08] people scrolling they just read bad news
[1:25:10] all the time don't be caught up in that
[1:25:12] is it going to make you happy is it
[1:25:14] going to make you rejoice is it going to
[1:25:15] make you a better person no it's going
[1:25:17] to do the opposite
[1:25:19] so why not why not feed off something
[1:25:21] that's positive
[1:25:22] i mean something that's been proven
[1:25:24] having something that's alive something
[1:25:25] that's real something that can help you
[1:25:27] something that can deliver i mean which
[1:25:29] is the word of god you know the devil
[1:25:31] does the devil will never encourage you
[1:25:32] to read your bible he will never
[1:25:34] encourage you to pray he'll never
[1:25:36] encourage you to put on a message he'll
[1:25:38] never encourage you to put on good
[1:25:39] spiritual music he'll never encourage he
[1:25:41] won't say no no i know i'm giving you a
[1:25:43] hard time
[1:25:45] but you should really go pray it'll help
[1:25:46] you he will never tell you he he'll give
[1:25:49] you a million things you need to do and
[1:25:50] you know what's wrong with this person
[1:25:52] why are you offended with this person
[1:25:53] what's going on with this person all
[1:25:55] those different things that's what he'll
[1:25:57] tell you and if you again to agree with
[1:25:59] him you're looking at the wrong person
[1:26:01] my help does not come from satan
[1:26:04] my help cometh from the lord
[1:26:06] amen and that's how we want to be
[1:26:08] hallelujah now the apostle paul would
[1:26:11] make this great statement he says for we
[1:26:13] walk by faith and not by sight
[1:26:15] now before he would make that statement
[1:26:17] he'd begin to talk about our earthly um
[1:26:19] you know though this earthly house of
[1:26:21] this tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[1:26:23] building of god
[1:26:24] not made with hands eternal in the
[1:26:26] heavens
[1:26:28] for in this we groan desire earnestly
[1:26:30] designed to be clothed upon with our
[1:26:32] house which is from heaven for for uh if
[1:26:35] so be that being clothed we shall not be
[1:26:37] found naked for we that are in this
[1:26:39] tabernacle do groans this one being
[1:26:42] burdened not for that which we should we
[1:26:44] would be unclosed but clothed upon that
[1:26:47] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[1:26:50] so he's saying that the reason we've
[1:26:51] grown is not that we just want to quit
[1:26:53] and leave the world no we just want to
[1:26:54] be in heaven
[1:26:56] and then he and then he continues down
[1:26:58] here he says now he that hath wrought us
[1:27:00] for the selfsame thing as of god who
[1:27:03] also hath given unto us the earnest of
[1:27:06] the spirit therefore we are always
[1:27:08] confident knowing that while we are at
[1:27:09] home in the body we are absent from the
[1:27:12] lord and he says but we walk by faith
[1:27:14] and not by sight so here hear the
[1:27:16] apostle paul would say we have a
[1:27:18] building in the heavens already we have
[1:27:20] what we call it the office it's already
[1:27:22] there it's been revealed so he looked
[1:27:24] and he saw the lord on the road to
[1:27:25] damascus and as he kept looking unto
[1:27:28] jesus the lord began to reveal more and
[1:27:30] more to him about his future home what
[1:27:32] he's meant to do upon the earth you know
[1:27:34] all the things that were going on and he
[1:27:36] said the reason we but this is me
[1:27:38] basically
[1:27:39] the reason we walk by faith and not by
[1:27:41] sight is because we have a home in the
[1:27:43] heavens so basically what happens upon
[1:27:46] the earth is not going to change the
[1:27:47] fact when this heart stops beating i'm
[1:27:49] going to step into an eternal body and
[1:27:51] it's already there for me it's not it's
[1:27:53] not being made right now
[1:27:54] the finishing touches aren't being put
[1:27:56] on it right now it's not on the assembly
[1:27:58] line about to come off it's already
[1:28:00] there waiting for me and it can't be
[1:28:02] dissolved it can't go away it can't it
[1:28:04] can't be deleted based on me down here
[1:28:07] it's already there i mean if you're an
[1:28:09] elect of god you have one in the heavens
[1:28:11] already so the reason he could walk and
[1:28:14] overcome and be victorious
[1:28:16] as he looked and he saw the lord
[1:28:19] and he saw hey
[1:28:20] this one
[1:28:22] this is god this is the messiah
[1:28:25] he's the god of the old testament i
[1:28:26] thought i was worshiping but i'm
[1:28:27] actually worshiping creeds of man but
[1:28:29] but he's a real true and living god and
[1:28:31] he's revealed to me that i have a body
[1:28:33] waiting in the heavens that's why he
[1:28:34] could say death where is your sting
[1:28:36] grave where is your victory but thanks
[1:28:38] be it the god who gives us a victory
[1:28:39] through our lord jesus christ i mean so
[1:28:41] his his his walk was not by sight now
[1:28:45] you think about his walk who was by
[1:28:46] sight he would have quit a long time ago
[1:28:49] you know he meets the lord on the road
[1:28:50] to damascus
[1:28:51] and then he goes to damascus and and it
[1:28:53] comes a time where people in damascus
[1:28:55] want to kill him
[1:28:56] he's got to be light over the wall by a
[1:28:58] basket run for his life you know he's
[1:29:00] stoned he's beaten he's chased from city
[1:29:02] to city he preaches in one city goes to
[1:29:04] another the ones that hate him in the
[1:29:06] previous city follow him to the next
[1:29:07] city and they stir the people up who are
[1:29:09] beginning to believe and yeah there's
[1:29:10] all this bunch of trouble going on
[1:29:13] chained to roman soldiers in dungeons
[1:29:15] shipwrecked bitten by the you know aspen
[1:29:18] all these or viper whatever it was on yo
[1:29:20] so he had a lot of trouble
[1:29:22] but he walked by faith and not by sight
[1:29:25] because his faith overrode
[1:29:29] what he was what his five senses were
[1:29:30] declaring because he looked
[1:29:33] amen and that's why the apostle said
[1:29:35] looking unto jesus
[1:29:37] now
[1:29:38] it was revealed to john
[1:29:41] that uh who the messiah was now faith is
[1:29:44] a revelation
[1:29:45] now when
[1:29:47] when it's revealed when something's
[1:29:49] revealed to us
[1:29:51] the reason it's done is that it would
[1:29:52] become reality and be manifested right
[1:29:54] when it's really revealed to you that
[1:29:56] you're healed
[1:29:57] then you become healed
[1:29:59] right
[1:30:01] when it's really revealed to you that
[1:30:02] your sins are washed away your life is
[1:30:04] different
[1:30:05] when it's revealed to you that calvary
[1:30:06] is more than a story but it's for you
[1:30:09] your life is different you can't help
[1:30:11] living different gods revealed to you
[1:30:13] hey i took your sins that day up calvary
[1:30:16] it's not just for someone else it's for
[1:30:17] you your whole life has changed amen
[1:30:20] when he gives you the baptism of the
[1:30:22] holy ghost there's a revelation god's in
[1:30:24] me amen not just anointed me but he
[1:30:26] dwells in me your whole life is
[1:30:27] different
[1:30:29] amen and we know revelation is more than
[1:30:32] just a mental understanding but you know
[1:30:34] your life has changed because of
[1:30:36] revelation
[1:30:37] now
[1:30:38] if you could if
[1:30:40] if we could just this may seem quite
[1:30:42] elementary but if we could just really
[1:30:43] recognize what the lord has already done
[1:30:45] for us not will do but has already done
[1:30:48] and we look at that i think it will
[1:30:49] change our lives
[1:30:51] i mean so even if we could go back into
[1:30:52] the old testament we know there's many
[1:30:55] uh laws and ceremonies and things which
[1:30:57] well we know all the law
[1:30:59] uh represented you know all the feasts
[1:31:01] and and and all the offerings they
[1:31:04] represented and shadow the lord jesus
[1:31:06] christ
[1:31:07] now
[1:31:08] the reason the jubilee trumpet blew
[1:31:11] was because the blood had been offered
[1:31:14] so we know in the old testament there
[1:31:16] was every 50 years was a jubilee and now
[1:31:18] every year the high priest had to had to
[1:31:21] take the blood of your blood offering
[1:31:23] into the holy of holies and sprinkle the
[1:31:25] mercy seat
[1:31:27] for the sins of the people so that was
[1:31:29] done every year but on the 50th year
[1:31:31] there was a jubilee which is a release
[1:31:33] right so those who are in slavery
[1:31:35] they could go free on that jubilee year
[1:31:37] if they chose to now
[1:31:39] the trumpet did not blow
[1:31:42] before the blood was offered it was all
[1:31:44] done after the fact
[1:31:46] right so so the high priest went in the
[1:31:48] blood was offered after he came out then
[1:31:51] the trumpets blew
[1:31:52] telling all of israel
[1:31:54] that the blood had been offered on their
[1:31:56] behalf
[1:31:57] so now they had to look i could say not
[1:31:59] with their physical eyes but you could
[1:32:01] say by the ears
[1:32:03] right and and if they believed it they
[1:32:05] could look to see the blood was applied
[1:32:07] for them and they could walk free i mean
[1:32:09] they could look and say it's the year of
[1:32:10] jubilee i have a right because of what
[1:32:13] the high priest has done on my behalf i
[1:32:15] can walk free because of what he has
[1:32:17] done so if they could look and say my
[1:32:19] sunday's been paid it's all been taken
[1:32:22] care of i have a legal right i can leave
[1:32:24] my slavery there's no sin dead upon me
[1:32:27] no more because the blood has been
[1:32:28] applied i mean they could walk free if
[1:32:30] they would just look right so so the
[1:32:33] blowing of the jubilee trumpet was a
[1:32:35] recognition that this had already been
[1:32:37] done
[1:32:38] hallelujah it wasn't going to be done it
[1:32:40] had already been done and so those who
[1:32:42] heard the jubilee trumpet and they
[1:32:44] walked free
[1:32:46] they because they had faith that the
[1:32:48] high priest went in and did it for them
[1:32:49] now they couldn't see the high priest
[1:32:51] going there was no live stream
[1:32:53] there was nothing they could physically
[1:32:54] go and see him physically do it but by
[1:32:56] faith they had to look and believe it
[1:32:59] and receive it then act upon it and walk
[1:33:01] free because it had already been done
[1:33:03] for them and it's the same thing our
[1:33:05] lord jesus is our high priest right he
[1:33:07] is offered by his own blood i mean he
[1:33:10] took his own blood into into glory
[1:33:13] for an atonement for our for our
[1:33:15] salvation
[1:33:16] amen and then now he came back down to
[1:33:18] earth he filled his church with the holy
[1:33:20] ghost and now that became the jubilee
[1:33:22] trumpet amen and now the prophet stood
[1:33:25] here and he was a jubilee trumpet to
[1:33:27] this age
[1:33:28] right no it's not it's not a physical
[1:33:30] instrument no more it's it's a living
[1:33:32] voice
[1:33:33] i mean so now
[1:33:34] the message to me it's never been rules
[1:33:36] and regulations it's been divine love
[1:33:38] expressed saying you can go free from
[1:33:40] sin you can go free from heartache you
[1:33:42] go free from trouble you go free from
[1:33:44] your past and you can
[1:33:46] you can you can forget those things and
[1:33:48] walk on with the lord jesus and be made
[1:33:49] a new creature to me it's been liberty
[1:33:53] amen now even even the scapegoat
[1:33:56] which which would be performed as well
[1:33:58] where where they'd take two goats
[1:34:00] and they would they would kill one
[1:34:03] and they would they would offer that
[1:34:04] blood but then they would they would put
[1:34:07] two hands on the head of the living goat
[1:34:09] and then so the high priest would do
[1:34:11] this put his two hands on the living
[1:34:12] goat's head and they would confess all
[1:34:14] the sins of the people and all their
[1:34:16] inequities
[1:34:17] you know all their transgressions and
[1:34:19] then they would they would take someone
[1:34:21] a chosen man would take that goat and
[1:34:23] would lead him into the wilderness and
[1:34:25] leave him there
[1:34:26] now some people would attribute this
[1:34:29] this scapegoat actually as a devil but
[1:34:31] no both of those goats represent christ
[1:34:34] because he's our offering but he's also
[1:34:35] our scapegoat walker's living he loved
[1:34:37] me dying he saved me buried he carried
[1:34:39] my sins far away the devil has no part
[1:34:42] in the atonement he's not even he's not
[1:34:44] even in the agreement with with us and
[1:34:46] god
[1:34:47] it's not him
[1:34:48] god and you this is not a three-way
[1:34:50] agreement it's actually a two-way
[1:34:51] agreement god and you
[1:34:53] amen he advanced some glory to you
[1:34:55] saying i purchased your salvation amen
[1:34:58] i've taken your sins far away i'm going
[1:35:00] to make you in my image i'm going to
[1:35:02] take you in a rapture i'm going to give
[1:35:03] you overcoming power this is this is
[1:35:05] what the lord did right he and
[1:35:08] in the old testament are in the oriental
[1:35:10] times like that
[1:35:12] if two men made an agreement
[1:35:14] they would they would kill an animal
[1:35:17] and they and they would say those who
[1:35:19] cannot fulfill their end of the bargain
[1:35:21] may they be like this dead animal
[1:35:23] so the lord came down
[1:35:25] he knew you couldn't keep it
[1:35:27] could could adam keep a conditional
[1:35:29] covenant no could israel no it was given
[1:35:32] to abraham by grace i have made you
[1:35:34] father of nations it's not if thou will
[1:35:36] i will but he saw man it wasn't in man
[1:35:38] to fulfill his end of the bargain so he
[1:35:41] he didn't put us on a conditional
[1:35:43] covenant he just said no no yeah we're
[1:35:45] we're going to make this a um covenant
[1:35:47] but i will be like the dead animal
[1:35:49] that's why he gave himself on calvary
[1:35:50] because he knew you couldn't keep you
[1:35:51] into the bargain
[1:35:53] amen so now atonement is all of the lord
[1:35:56] the devil has no part in it
[1:35:58] so so both of these goats are actually
[1:36:01] our representations of our lord jesus
[1:36:03] christ so now he had to be this goat had
[1:36:06] to be taken by a chosen man into the
[1:36:08] wilderness now with goats i think i
[1:36:11] think it's like sheep they can if they
[1:36:13] if they know who you are they can follow
[1:36:15] you so apparently this one who is to
[1:36:17] lead the goat into the wilderness had to
[1:36:19] cover their head
[1:36:21] so so the goat wouldn't recognize him
[1:36:22] take him into the wilderness and then he
[1:36:24] had to basically just abandon him there
[1:36:26] in order for the wild and you know and
[1:36:27] then the wild beasts and things would
[1:36:29] have tore that goat limb from limb
[1:36:30] because it wouldn't know where it was
[1:36:32] now our lord jesus was gladly
[1:36:35] our scapegoat
[1:36:36] because the joy set before him he
[1:36:38] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:36:40] amen so brother braham sit here and and
[1:36:42] living dying buried rising coming
[1:36:44] he says now
[1:36:46] he was also in this berry he represented
[1:36:48] in the old testament he said they had a
[1:36:50] sin offering at the cleansing of the
[1:36:52] sanctuary and that sin offering was that
[1:36:54] they'd taken two goats one guy was
[1:36:56] killed and the other goat had the sins
[1:36:58] were placed upon the dead goat put upon
[1:37:00] the live goat remember jesus was a sheep
[1:37:02] he was a lamb but in this case he became
[1:37:05] a goat he was righteousness because he
[1:37:07] was god the sheep but he became a goat
[1:37:09] sin that he might be the sin offering
[1:37:12] for you and i from a sheep to a goat and
[1:37:14] jesus was represent represented in both
[1:37:17] animals both goats for he died he died
[1:37:20] for the atonement the sick and the sins
[1:37:22] from the atonement was put on the
[1:37:23] scapegoat and the scapegoat took the
[1:37:25] sins of the people and went far into the
[1:37:27] wilderness to bear the sins of the
[1:37:28] people what was it it was the death and
[1:37:31] burial of our lord jesus dying living he
[1:37:34] loved me dying he saved me buried he
[1:37:36] carried my sins far away he took the
[1:37:38] sins of the people upon himself and
[1:37:40] carried them plumbed down to the lowest
[1:37:41] of hades he was the sin offering he had
[1:37:44] the sins of the people he died for them
[1:37:46] and also the sins was placed upon him
[1:37:48] and he took our sins far away
[1:37:51] so far that god could never see them no
[1:37:53] more
[1:37:54] hallelujah think of it now you could
[1:37:56] just he says he says oh the church could
[1:37:58] scream hallelujah for such a savior not
[1:38:00] only is the sins forgiven but they're
[1:38:02] buried in the sea of forgetfulness to be
[1:38:04] remembered no more see if you really
[1:38:06] realize you're you're not just forgiven
[1:38:08] your sins are carried far away i mean
[1:38:10] that there there should be no more
[1:38:12] condemnation upon you because our
[1:38:13] scapegoat the lord jesus christ carried
[1:38:16] them far away and he didn't bring them
[1:38:18] back
[1:38:19] amen that they are put in the sea of
[1:38:21] god's forgetfulness you know the it says
[1:38:23] one place in the scripture that the sea
[1:38:25] is so deep even the adders can't get
[1:38:27] down to the bottom of them amen to the
[1:38:29] sea of god's forgetfulness is so deep
[1:38:31] the devil can't swim down and pluck up
[1:38:32] what's in the bottom of it hallelujah so
[1:38:35] now our sins aren't remember our sins
[1:38:37] aren't just put in god's folder for for
[1:38:39] one day where he gets anointed us and
[1:38:41] pulls out says remember what you do no
[1:38:42] no that's not how it works the blood of
[1:38:44] jesus christ annihilates sin
[1:38:47] amen they've been carried far away and
[1:38:49] the devil will have their answer for
[1:38:50] that sin on the day of judgment not you
[1:38:52] it's not attributed to you anymore it's
[1:38:54] gone
[1:38:55] hallelujah amen so remember if we could
[1:38:58] just look remember look
[1:39:00] if you look to the lord that he's
[1:39:01] carried your sins far away then all the
[1:39:03] condemnation of your past it just goes
[1:39:06] because he's taken it away it's gone
[1:39:09] hallelujah
[1:39:11] amen see you've got to look see the
[1:39:12] devil will try and get you to look at
[1:39:14] your memory but don't be haunted by a
[1:39:16] memory
[1:39:17] right just just bring the memory into
[1:39:19] the present so hold on
[1:39:21] yes i was that person once upon a time
[1:39:25] once upon a time
[1:39:26] but devil hold on i'm just going to
[1:39:28] update you let's just scroll the video
[1:39:29] forward
[1:39:32] let's scroll the video actually no no
[1:39:33] let's scroll the video back
[1:39:35] way before there was time before the
[1:39:37] foundation of the world the lamb was
[1:39:38] slaying
[1:39:39] and in that great slam lamb amen i was
[1:39:42] in him there i was an attribute of god
[1:39:44] hallelujah and satan that's why that's
[1:39:46] why god asked job where were you before
[1:39:48] the foundation of the world where the
[1:39:50] sons of god the morning stars shouted
[1:39:51] for joy you know satan god was trying
[1:39:54] god was telling job to look and to see
[1:39:57] you were back there and me rejoicing i
[1:40:00] didn't see you on the ash heap in your
[1:40:01] great trial i saw you overcoming this
[1:40:04] thing shouting rejoicing on the other
[1:40:06] side and that's why the prophet would
[1:40:08] say that we justified we never did it in
[1:40:10] the first place well the first place was
[1:40:12] god's mind before the foundation of the
[1:40:14] world so when god thought of you and i
[1:40:16] he didn't see us in this thing
[1:40:18] troubled and you know
[1:40:20] in this fallen condition now he saw us
[1:40:22] as perfect redeemed sons and daughters
[1:40:24] of god maintenance image sinless and you
[1:40:27] know sinless perfection
[1:40:29] hallelujah that's why the prophet said
[1:40:31] you never did it in the first place
[1:40:32] we'll go back to the first place because
[1:40:34] remember this message well actually all
[1:40:37] of life if i put it this way we are
[1:40:39] going back to our point of origin
[1:40:42] right so natural life is staying here
[1:40:46] if i put it that way but eternal life
[1:40:48] we're going back from where we came from
[1:40:51] that's why we can say i have a body in
[1:40:53] the heavens waiting
[1:40:54] amen eternal in the heavens so this
[1:40:56] message is actually a one calling people
[1:40:59] who are actually attributes of god it's
[1:41:01] not haphazard you're a believer
[1:41:03] it's not because of your family it's not
[1:41:05] because of your grandparents or your
[1:41:07] lineage natural lineage whatever you
[1:41:09] know it's far beyond that and god put a
[1:41:11] seat of predestination in you and he
[1:41:14] called you by his word and here you are
[1:41:16] a
[1:41:16] believer because remember when the lord
[1:41:19] does something he attributes to all it
[1:41:22] to all of his children
[1:41:24] that's why jesus did not have to die on
[1:41:26] the cross when i accept him as my savior
[1:41:28] he'd already done it right he didn't
[1:41:30] have to shed any more blood to heal me
[1:41:31] he'd already done it
[1:41:33] right he's already done it i remember
[1:41:35] when he did it i was on his mind it was
[1:41:37] attributed to me
[1:41:38] that's why in whenever year it was when
[1:41:42] you met the lord it became alive to you
[1:41:44] because he did it back there for you
[1:41:46] remember god doesn't run his business in
[1:41:48] a haphazard way he doesn't he's got
[1:41:50] purpose right he doesn't have collateral
[1:41:53] he has no he has his children and he
[1:41:55] died on calvary to redeem his children
[1:41:57] his family i mean that's why it means
[1:41:59] something to you no matter how much you
[1:42:00] fail fall whatever there's something in
[1:42:02] you saying lord you purchase my
[1:42:03] salvation i want to get up one more time
[1:42:05] i want to keep serving you i mean
[1:42:07] because he put a desire in you i mean
[1:42:09] far greater than your failure and your
[1:42:11] own um you know your own discouragement
[1:42:15] far above those things
[1:42:17] to get up and keep walking on
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:22] amen
[1:42:24] hallelujah not only is our sins forgiven
[1:42:26] i just want to read this again because
[1:42:28] it makes me feel happy for they're
[1:42:29] buried in the sea of forgetfulness to be
[1:42:31] remembered no more isn't it amazing god
[1:42:33] can forget
[1:42:34] the one who made all things and can see
[1:42:35] through time through foreknowledge he
[1:42:37] can forget
[1:42:38] hallelujah you know the devil can't
[1:42:40] forget god can forget
[1:42:43] you know it's amazing
[1:42:45] we can
[1:42:46] god can fully forgive us of something
[1:42:49] take it from his memory
[1:42:51] and then the devil brings it up again
[1:42:53] and we can feel so burdened by it and we
[1:42:55] can cry to god god forgive me
[1:42:57] for such and such a thing and then as
[1:42:59] he's praying to us he looks through his
[1:43:00] great record book
[1:43:03] and he finds your name
[1:43:05] and all he sees is a blank page
[1:43:09] there's no what do you mean there's no
[1:43:10] you know what do you mean that sin it's
[1:43:12] not there it's gone why cause his blood
[1:43:14] cleanses our book
[1:43:15] hallelujah
[1:43:17] amen he takes it all away it's gone
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:22] now there there are certain uh it's very
[1:43:26] important that we keep looking
[1:43:28] not just once but keep looking
[1:43:30] now peter after the resurrection you
[1:43:32] know i'm amazed by peter
[1:43:34] peter peter would be the one who would
[1:43:37] who would who would curse denying the
[1:43:38] lord try and kill a
[1:43:40] cataman's head off but because he wasn't
[1:43:42] a swordsman just cut off his ear you
[1:43:44] know did all these
[1:43:46] wild things we'd say you know but but
[1:43:48] peter peter was a kind of a man
[1:43:51] you know there was there was such a
[1:43:52] great quality in him he knew that the
[1:43:54] lord was the messiah
[1:43:57] and even though he denied the lord and
[1:43:59] god told him he would do it but he was
[1:44:01] so proud he wouldn't listen but he
[1:44:02] denied the lord he went badly after
[1:44:04] doing it all those things but then after
[1:44:06] the resurrection peter said to some of
[1:44:08] the disciples i'm just going to go
[1:44:10] fishing again
[1:44:11] i'm a fisherman this is just who i am
[1:44:13] let's go fishing again
[1:44:15] and and some of the others said yeah
[1:44:16] we'll go fishing with you
[1:44:18] and then so and they caught nothing
[1:44:21] there's a breaking of the dawn they see
[1:44:23] a figure standing on the seashore saying
[1:44:25] children have you caught anything
[1:44:27] i doubt very much they would have in a
[1:44:29] sing-song voice said no
[1:44:32] that would have been grumpy fishing all
[1:44:34] night throw the net here throw it here
[1:44:35] take the boat there
[1:44:37] nothing
[1:44:38] but yet
[1:44:40] the lord came to him
[1:44:42] because the lord wanted him to look
[1:44:44] he did not want peter to stay in this
[1:44:47] discouraged
[1:44:49] downcast state this same thing with us
[1:44:51] he doesn't want us to stay that way he
[1:44:54] wants to bring us through those things
[1:44:56] then it becomes a victory it becomes a
[1:44:57] testimony so there's this peter he's
[1:45:00] denied the lord three times he's whipped
[1:45:02] bitterly he's a miserable failure of a
[1:45:05] you know of a disciple he feels he's
[1:45:07] washed up he's he's done too much wrong
[1:45:09] but the lord appears on the physically
[1:45:12] on the seashore calls out
[1:45:14] because he doesn't want to leave peter
[1:45:16] in that state
[1:45:17] and then so peter
[1:45:18] peter looks you could say and he says
[1:45:21] noah caught nothing but then john
[1:45:24] tells peter look again i'm just i'm just
[1:45:27] rephrasing it look again
[1:45:29] look again at that figure it's not just
[1:45:30] a casual observer look again it's the
[1:45:32] lord and peter looked and he saw the
[1:45:35] lord there and there was something in
[1:45:37] him but he says i've just got to get to
[1:45:38] him so i'm not just going to look from
[1:45:40] afar i'm going to get into his presence
[1:45:43] it's the same thing with you and i we
[1:45:44] don't want to look afar and say we want
[1:45:45] to get into his presence he didn't know
[1:45:47] if he'd be accepted but there's
[1:45:49] something in the believer i'm going
[1:45:50] anyway
[1:45:51] hallelujah greater than discouragement
[1:45:53] pain hurt disappointment in their own
[1:45:55] selves that he was going anyway it's the
[1:45:57] same thing with you and i hallelujah so
[1:46:00] so the lord wanted peter to look because
[1:46:02] he wanted to take away the
[1:46:03] discouragement
[1:46:05] take away the disappointed on himself
[1:46:06] aren't you glad that our god's like that
[1:46:09] hallelujah
[1:46:10] but you've got to look
[1:46:12] amen john looked
[1:46:15] there up in the yo up in glory he was
[1:46:17] taken up in revelations 4 and 5. he
[1:46:19] looked he said there was no man found
[1:46:21] worthy but an elder came and said you
[1:46:23] know look again
[1:46:25] look again remember he had he had he had
[1:46:27] walked with jesus
[1:46:28] he had talked with jesus he was loved by
[1:46:31] jesus he had he had eaten with jesus
[1:46:33] seen many
[1:46:35] yeah the lord did many mighty things he
[1:46:36] saw jesus die he saw the tomb open he
[1:46:39] saw jesus resurrected
[1:46:41] but yet he had to look again
[1:46:44] because he was he was he you know he
[1:46:46] went much because no man was found
[1:46:48] worthy to open the book and read it let
[1:46:50] alone look upon
[1:46:51] and as his weeping one of the elders
[1:46:53] said basically look again
[1:46:56] you know the lord wants us to look again
[1:46:59] remember he is the answer to every
[1:47:00] problem
[1:47:01] he is the answer to every discouragement
[1:47:04] the answer to every pain and and the
[1:47:06] answer comes when when the lord reveals
[1:47:08] his word to you and i he brings comfort
[1:47:10] you know like the psalms mean a lot when
[1:47:12] you're going through something because
[1:47:13] it because beforehand you just read it
[1:47:15] saying oh that's a nice psalm but when
[1:47:16] you're going through the same pain you
[1:47:17] say that's a real nice psalm
[1:47:19] hallelujah or you know you see paul
[1:47:21] going through something trouble going on
[1:47:23] and you can really relate
[1:47:25] amen because you looked again but you
[1:47:27] see a deeper a deeper meaning something
[1:47:29] is a lot more comforting in it
[1:47:31] i mean so john john was told to look
[1:47:34] again
[1:47:35] and he was told look and you see the
[1:47:36] line of the tribe of judah and when he
[1:47:38] looked he saw the lamb of god
[1:47:40] same being
[1:47:41] amen and then his his weeping turned
[1:47:44] into rejoicing because he looked
[1:47:47] hallelujah so the one that he saw
[1:47:48] purchased salvation and and and rose
[1:47:51] from the grave is the same one that he
[1:47:53] saw walk from the eternities and take
[1:47:55] the book amen to to to claim everything
[1:47:57] that he purchased amen and if we can
[1:47:59] just look remember
[1:48:01] john
[1:48:02] looked at was looking for someone who
[1:48:05] was already there to do the job
[1:48:07] amen jesus did not appear like he wasn't
[1:48:10] there he was in the eternities and the
[1:48:11] seating but now he steps forth to take
[1:48:13] the book he was already up there
[1:48:15] right so if we can just look and and
[1:48:17] realize the lord has already done it
[1:48:20] he's already done it right that's why
[1:48:22] we're called to look
[1:48:24] amen amen aren't you glad like i just go
[1:48:26] back to the whole scapegoat again
[1:48:28] you know you're an israelite
[1:48:30] you realize the scapegoat's got to be
[1:48:32] given your burden your sin is still
[1:48:34] there it's been painful but your sin is
[1:48:35] still there but and you don't know the
[1:48:37] scapegoat's gone but someone will come
[1:48:39] to you say hold on no no it's being
[1:48:41] carried far away
[1:48:43] hallelujah so you mean it's not in the
[1:48:45] camp anymore no it's not in israel
[1:48:46] anymore no it's in the wilderness the la
[1:48:49] the goat's gone where did he go in the
[1:48:50] wilderness can we find him no we don't
[1:48:52] want to find him it's god has been
[1:48:54] carried far away you could rejoice if
[1:48:56] you're a real israelite say praise god
[1:48:57] my sins have been carried away amen it's
[1:49:00] already happened amen so the same thing
[1:49:02] with you and i if we can just look and
[1:49:04] realize the lord's taking care of it all
[1:49:06] not just a part of it the whole thing
[1:49:09] amen he's purchased our entire salvation
[1:49:11] amen he's purchased our healing amen
[1:49:14] he's purchased everything we have need
[1:49:16] of even the taking of the book it's
[1:49:17] happened
[1:49:18] amen now he's here to claim what he
[1:49:20] purchased which is you and i
[1:49:22] hallelujah you know brother brown would
[1:49:24] say here
[1:49:25] you know he would say many times the
[1:49:27] visions don't heal
[1:49:29] your faith heals you your faith in the
[1:49:31] finished work of calvary heals you he
[1:49:33] says visions just actually prove that
[1:49:35] he's here
[1:49:36] and he's still the living word but as
[1:49:38] far as healing you it doesn't it only
[1:49:39] lets you know he's here he's already
[1:49:41] healed you
[1:49:42] amen he'd say in a couple of places if
[1:49:45] jesus was standing on this platform in
[1:49:46] this suit and you came to and said can
[1:49:48] you heal me he says i'm sorry i can't
[1:49:50] i've already healed you i've already
[1:49:52] done it
[1:49:53] because many times we have in our mind
[1:49:55] lord can you do this for me he's already
[1:49:56] done it you just got in faith accept it
[1:49:59] and receive it
[1:50:00] hallelujah amen if you're sick you were
[1:50:02] healed when jesus was wounded for your
[1:50:04] transgressions amen with the stripes we
[1:50:07] are healed it's already been done we're
[1:50:08] not looking for our messiah to come and
[1:50:10] purchase our healing purchase our
[1:50:12] salvation purchase the salvation of our
[1:50:14] family and our loss your loved ones no
[1:50:16] it's already happened
[1:50:17] he's already done it
[1:50:19] amen we've just got to accept that he's
[1:50:21] done it
[1:50:22] hallelujah he says he says here to
[1:50:25] greater than solomon is here he says god
[1:50:26] if heaven knows both of us he knows why
[1:50:28] you're here he knows why i'm here but to
[1:50:31] know you i do not i have no idea what
[1:50:33] you're here for but if god of heaven
[1:50:35] will reveal it to me what you're here
[1:50:37] for will you believe me to be his
[1:50:38] prophet he says i could not heal you you
[1:50:41] know that but it'll only raise your
[1:50:43] faith to healing
[1:50:45] i mean so the healing's there but our
[1:50:47] faith needs to be raised to receive it
[1:50:49] so it's the same thing when we gather
[1:50:51] you know this should be
[1:50:53] every service should be a faith raising
[1:50:55] service no matter if it's teaching
[1:50:57] evangelism whatever it is pastoral ship
[1:50:59] it should be faith raising because the
[1:51:00] promises are there brother ram says that
[1:51:02] the holy ghost is pillow fires there in
[1:51:04] the meetings to to release our desires
[1:51:07] to us i mean to our desire to be free if
[1:51:09] we are desire to be healed i mean desire
[1:51:12] for our lovers to come and desire for
[1:51:13] more of god he's here to release that
[1:51:15] desire to us
[1:51:17] hallelujah
[1:51:19] amen
[1:51:20] he says here in resurrection of lazarus
[1:51:22] he says you know sometimes wonder how
[1:51:24] the lord feels about us sometime when he
[1:51:27] does um when he does so many things for
[1:51:30] us and yet we just sit like we're in
[1:51:33] like we're in a subconsciously don't we
[1:51:35] aren't we all guilty i am we just sit
[1:51:37] and say well lord i wish you'd do
[1:51:39] something for me
[1:51:40] this is what he's saying lordo who's
[1:51:42] who's been in that category i just put
[1:51:44] my own hand up lord i wish you'd do
[1:51:45] something for me he says he can't do
[1:51:47] nothing no more for us than what he's
[1:51:49] already done
[1:51:50] he's already healed us he's already
[1:51:52] saved us he's already given us joy he
[1:51:55] gives us his peace he's he's our shield
[1:51:57] our buckler everything that we have is
[1:51:59] in him and he's done paid the price of
[1:52:01] redemption
[1:52:02] to redeem us back as sons and daughters
[1:52:04] of god
[1:52:05] amen he says it's the only thing in the
[1:52:08] world that's left undone is physical
[1:52:10] death
[1:52:11] but that's going to be taken away he
[1:52:13] purchased the taking away of that but so
[1:52:16] really we should really realize you know
[1:52:18] you know the blood
[1:52:19] puts us in speaking terms with god
[1:52:22] amen well we can actually go before the
[1:52:23] throne of almighty god say father i have
[1:52:25] a need
[1:52:27] you've purchased it
[1:52:28] you've healed me you've saved my family
[1:52:31] but i've come in faith because i want to
[1:52:32] see it become manifested i mean i don't
[1:52:34] just want to be floating around and say
[1:52:36] yes but i want to see it become sight
[1:52:39] amen because that's really because
[1:52:40] remember he's purchased it it's like if
[1:52:42] someone bought me a house i've always
[1:52:44] wanted now i'm not putting out any thing
[1:52:46] enough but but i just want to give an
[1:52:48] illustration i was thinking how could i
[1:52:49] an illustration you could see the house
[1:52:51] you want and you say that's a perfect
[1:52:53] house for me
[1:52:54] and then you could say maybe see a for
[1:52:56] sale sign in front of it but you know
[1:52:58] you don't have the money in the bank to
[1:52:59] do it but then what if someone came
[1:53:01] along and well maybe the next day you
[1:53:04] come and you see a sold sticker on it no
[1:53:06] doubt there'd be a disappointment there
[1:53:08] because you're still enjoying the dream
[1:53:09] of you know but then it's sold but then
[1:53:12] what if what if a person came along and
[1:53:14] said now here's the keys to the house
[1:53:17] here's the case
[1:53:18] you know you would say it's the same
[1:53:19] thing with healing you you'd say but
[1:53:21] how's this so i haven't bought it i
[1:53:23] haven't purchased someone else did
[1:53:24] someone already bought it for you
[1:53:27] you don't have to go buy it it's already
[1:53:29] been bought
[1:53:30] here's the keys
[1:53:32] to possess the house
[1:53:34] now i could rejoice that the house is
[1:53:37] mine
[1:53:38] but i need to go and live in it
[1:53:40] well i need to believe that this key
[1:53:42] is what's needed to open the door to go
[1:53:45] into the house
[1:53:46] it's wonderful to talk about the house
[1:53:48] but when you're in the house
[1:53:50] when you put your furniture in when you
[1:53:51] live there that's a whole different
[1:53:53] thing on paper it's yours anyway
[1:53:56] right it's under my name there's the
[1:53:57] deed there's my name i am the possessor
[1:53:59] of this house on paper so on paper it's
[1:54:02] all the same we are possesses of eternal
[1:54:04] life all healing is ours redemption
[1:54:06] every blessing god died for it's here
[1:54:09] right on paper because remember this our
[1:54:11] names are uh in this book we have fallen
[1:54:14] heir to everything that jesus fell there
[1:54:16] too
[1:54:17] right but he's given us a key of faith
[1:54:19] to go in just like a key to a house we
[1:54:21] have a key of faith already
[1:54:24] it's already in us right and if you say
[1:54:26] lord increase my faith you say well here
[1:54:28] you go
[1:54:29] he it's already been purchased our
[1:54:31] rapture has been purchased the body
[1:54:33] changed the dead in christ resurrecting
[1:54:34] that's already been purchased
[1:54:36] everything you can imagine god doing
[1:54:38] it's already been purchased
[1:54:40] hallelujah so but he gives you the key
[1:54:43] but now you've got to take that key of
[1:54:44] faith put it in the door and unlock it
[1:54:47] now
[1:54:48] the key that opens every door is faith
[1:54:52] in the finished work of calvary brother
[1:54:53] bram says
[1:54:54] it's faith in the finished work of
[1:54:56] calvary now ask you the question has it
[1:54:59] become real to you that he died for you
[1:55:01] right has it become real to you that he
[1:55:03] carried your sins far away
[1:55:05] he died and he became a sinner that you
[1:55:07] could become like him
[1:55:09] amen he became sin that would become the
[1:55:11] very righteous of god through christ
[1:55:13] right so so we believe that eh we
[1:55:16] believe he rose again we believe his
[1:55:17] holy spirit is in us
[1:55:19] amen you can go back in your life and
[1:55:21] see we where you met him where his word
[1:55:23] become real he transformed your life
[1:55:25] you're now a new creature okay so if
[1:55:27] he's done all that
[1:55:28] then he'll do the rest
[1:55:31] hallelujah
[1:55:32] amen isn't that because he's the same
[1:55:33] god
[1:55:34] he doesn't say now well this offerings
[1:55:36] for this
[1:55:37] and then now this offerings for this
[1:55:40] and now this offerings for this you know
[1:55:41] so it's not like he said well i'll shed
[1:55:43] this blood here for salvation but not
[1:55:46] for healing and then i'll come and do
[1:55:47] this sacrifice and shed it for healing
[1:55:49] but not for the baptism of the holy
[1:55:51] ghost and now i'm going to do this here
[1:55:53] and then i'm going to do this one for
[1:55:54] overcoming power and then you've got to
[1:55:56] go through all these different
[1:55:57] sacrifices to receive the body change no
[1:56:00] it's one
[1:56:01] that's one so if he did it once for
[1:56:03] everything
[1:56:04] and he's become part of you and i
[1:56:06] he's given you the key of faith
[1:56:09] faith in the finished work of calvary
[1:56:10] because remember that opened up
[1:56:12] everything when he purchased our
[1:56:14] salvation he purchased our body change
[1:56:16] when he purchased our salvation no demon
[1:56:18] can stand before the church of god i
[1:56:20] mean when he purchased our salvation he
[1:56:22] unlocked the door for god to come and
[1:56:23] dwell in man again hallelujah when he
[1:56:25] purchased our salvation he was
[1:56:27] purchasing the resurrection of the dead
[1:56:29] saints
[1:56:30] past president future
[1:56:32] when he purchased our salvation he
[1:56:34] purchased the redemption of this whole
[1:56:35] world
[1:56:36] so he
[1:56:37] he he purchased by dropping his blood
[1:56:39] upon the earth he was actually claiming
[1:56:41] i'm going to put my new jerusalem right
[1:56:43] here
[1:56:44] i mean by purchasing our salvation he
[1:56:46] was he was actually purchasing this
[1:56:49] place he's going to burn the devils off
[1:56:51] you know a place that's unkept you've
[1:56:53] got to get a weed whacker out spray you
[1:56:54] just got to deal with it you know so
[1:56:56] god's not just going to spray the earth
[1:56:57] he's going to burn the atmosphere burn
[1:56:59] up the devils burn everything off it but
[1:57:00] that was purchased on calvary
[1:57:04] amen so now he's given us
[1:57:06] faith if he's given you faith to repent
[1:57:10] if he's given you faith to receive the
[1:57:11] holy ghost be baptized you know if
[1:57:13] there's any faith for that he's given
[1:57:15] you faith for all things
[1:57:17] you say well i don't feel i have the
[1:57:18] faith well then say lord help my
[1:57:20] unbelief i believe lord help my unbelief
[1:57:21] and he'll give it to you
[1:57:24] amen so now
[1:57:27] he has purchased all things
[1:57:30] for us
[1:57:31] all we need is a pure unadulterated
[1:57:34] faith in the word of god and the
[1:57:36] finished works that god required at
[1:57:38] calvary this isn't the token
[1:57:41] knowing that there is nothing we could
[1:57:42] do to save ourselves we just accept what
[1:57:44] he did for us abraham believed god was
[1:57:46] reputed for him for righteousness then
[1:57:48] god gave him the seal of circumcision as
[1:57:50] a token that he had received his faith
[1:57:52] there is a gospel now when we claim that
[1:57:54] we believe god then god will identify
[1:57:56] our faith pardon me will give us a token
[1:57:58] of the blood of the lord jesus that
[1:58:00] finished work
[1:58:02] that finished the work for us at calvary
[1:58:03] then our our life is his the life of our
[1:58:07] sacrifice is in us
[1:58:09] that's why it is it is finished
[1:58:12] amen it's done
[1:58:14] so now all we need and all we so
[1:58:16] you know the faith we have we actually
[1:58:18] stumble at the faith we have
[1:58:21] the blood was applied in israel i mean i
[1:58:23] mean there in egypt in the passover it
[1:58:25] was it was a common weed hyssop was a
[1:58:27] common weed
[1:58:28] so if we're in wellington you know i
[1:58:31] don't want to say this is a joke but you
[1:58:32] know if if the passover was happening in
[1:58:34] wellington he could say go get some
[1:58:36] ghosts
[1:58:38] or go get some blackberry it grows
[1:58:40] everywhere you have to go up some
[1:58:42] mountainside to find some rare
[1:58:44] little shrub and no
[1:58:46] faith is so common
[1:58:48] that we stumble over it
[1:58:50] the same faith that we
[1:58:52] use to turn on a light switch to turn on
[1:58:53] the light
[1:58:54] is the same faith we can actually use to
[1:58:56] approach god with
[1:58:58] but we stumble over we think we've got
[1:58:59] to work something up no no we just have
[1:59:00] to accept that he's already done it for
[1:59:02] us
[1:59:02] and walk into it
[1:59:05] amen so i'm just going to finish with
[1:59:07] this scripture here in romans 8.
[1:59:10] he says but we know this is romans 8 28
[1:59:12] but we know that all but we know
[1:59:15] that to the ones wait hold on
[1:59:19] what okay i don't know what version i
[1:59:21] have here can you um can you put that up
[1:59:26] i can't even read the king james half
[1:59:27] the time how am i going to read this out
[1:59:28] loud now romans 8 i'm going to read from
[1:59:30] verse 28
[1:59:36] and we know that all things work
[1:59:37] together for good to them that love god
[1:59:40] and to them which are called according
[1:59:41] to his purpose
[1:59:43] this message calls us to his purpose
[1:59:46] right his purpose is rapture his
[1:59:48] purchases redemption has purchased the
[1:59:50] gathering of his bride what does the
[1:59:51] message do brother ram said the
[1:59:53] bridegroom call cut will come right
[1:59:54] through this what it's a call to a union
[1:59:57] so we we love him and we're called
[1:59:59] according to his purpose it's you know
[2:00:01] it's neat when you find yourself in the
[2:00:02] scripture
[2:00:04] amen and and he's the one who shows you
[2:00:06] yourself in the scripture i'm glad about
[2:00:08] that for whom he did for no he did also
[2:00:10] predestinate to be conformed to the
[2:00:12] image of his son that he might be the
[2:00:14] firstborn among many brethren what is
[2:00:17] the image of his son his word
[2:00:19] so we are predicted to be conformed to
[2:00:21] the image of his word so in other words
[2:00:22] we become living bibles
[2:00:24] right
[2:00:25] amen
[2:00:27] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[2:00:29] he also called and whom he called them
[2:00:32] he also justified so
[2:00:34] notice it's not saying he will he has
[2:00:37] he has not well he has amen so we're not
[2:00:41] looking for all one day lord when's it
[2:00:42] no no he's already done it
[2:00:44] amen remember irrespective of how you
[2:00:47] feel about yourself see don't don't try
[2:00:49] and put what you think about yourself in
[2:00:51] front of what god has said about you
[2:00:53] what you take privacy abraham abraham
[2:00:55] could have said i'm old
[2:00:57] i'm real i feel old i'm acting old i'm
[2:00:59] old now i'm old and and he could have
[2:01:01] kept putting that in front of him you
[2:01:03] know in front of god's promise no i'm
[2:01:05] old i'm old i'm old but no he said no
[2:01:07] god your word's true it's true it's true
[2:01:09] you've promised it lord and he put what
[2:01:11] god said about him
[2:01:12] father of nations he put that above what
[2:01:15] he thought about himself alright no not
[2:01:17] more than thought actually his current
[2:01:18] life state
[2:01:20] which is far more than just thinking
[2:01:21] about it
[2:01:23] amen so so when it says moreover him
[2:01:25] also did predict now i'm just going back
[2:01:27] to verse 30. moreover whom he did
[2:01:28] predestinate them he also called and
[2:01:31] whom he called them he also justified
[2:01:33] and whom he justified them he also
[2:01:35] glorified
[2:01:36] he's already done it we've just got to
[2:01:38] step into it
[2:01:39] you know it's like oh lord can you heal
[2:01:40] me he already has healed me but by faith
[2:01:42] you accept he's already done it for you
[2:01:44] that's manifested in your life lord can
[2:01:46] you give me the holy ghost well he
[2:01:47] purchased it that you can receive the
[2:01:49] holy ghost
[2:01:50] amen it's already he's already paid for
[2:01:52] it lord can you save me he already saved
[2:01:54] you that down calvary it's already done
[2:01:56] we just gotta buy faith accept it it's
[2:01:58] so simple i think we go over the top of
[2:02:00] it
[2:02:02] oh lord i need to know you more well he
[2:02:04] purchased a way for you to know more
[2:02:06] just just just keep walking with god oh

[2:02:10] the holy ghost in you you're ready for
[2:02:11] the rapture if you're sealed to the day
[2:02:13] of your redemption by the holy ghost not
[2:02:15] just anointed but he's in you you're
[2:02:17] ready
[2:02:18] amen well then what's the purpose of the
[2:02:20] rest of his life to build character
[2:02:22] to mature to have victories to give us
[2:02:25] more to praise him for over on the other
[2:02:27] side
[2:02:28] amen we're going to have eternity to
[2:02:30] give him glory that's why he gives us a
[2:02:31] whole bunch of testimonies to praise him
[2:02:33] for and it's not we're not gonna you
[2:02:35] know sometimes you think you know
[2:02:36] someone tells you a testament like
[2:02:38] christine you'll tell me a testimony
[2:02:39] something happened a few years ago in
[2:02:40] our lives i'm like really yeah oh yeah
[2:02:42] that happened that's right but me and my
[2:02:43] dumb mind i just forget things you know
[2:02:45] but on that side there'll be no done
[2:02:47] mine you remember it exactly all the
[2:02:50] details
[2:02:51] hallelujah
[2:02:56] what shall we say then to these things
[2:02:59] i don't know can it really no no no
[2:03:01] if god be for us
[2:03:03] then who can be against us
[2:03:05] amen he that spared not his own son but
[2:03:07] delivered up for us all how shall not he
[2:03:10] how shall not
[2:03:12] how shall he not with him also freely
[2:03:14] give us all things

[2:03:18] you give us all things
[2:03:20] hallelujah so if god would be for me who
[2:03:22] can be against me that's why you've got
