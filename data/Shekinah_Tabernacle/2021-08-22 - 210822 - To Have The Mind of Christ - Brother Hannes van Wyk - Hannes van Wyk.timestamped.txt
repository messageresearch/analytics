[45:43] worship the lord in spirit and in truth
[45:47] it is wonderful to be a child of the
[45:49] living god
[45:51] to find your position and to know that
[45:53] he is an unchanging god
[45:55] a wonderful god and we appreciate the
[45:58] lord this morning
[45:59] i'm happy to have my wife with me here
[46:01] today and
[46:02] just being such a blessing in my life
[46:05] and such a support
[46:07] it is wonderful and we are
[46:09] happy to hear that our precious brother
[46:12] ben is going full time into the ministry
[46:15] that's quite a big surprise and
[46:17] i'm sure the church is happy and excited
[46:20] and it's it's just
[46:22] good when the lord has called the man he
[46:24] has called his wife and
[46:26] together they will be able to stand in
[46:28] faith to be faithful to be true to that
[46:30] calling
[46:32] and we are blessed to know them and we
[46:34] appreciate the invitation to stand here
[46:36] today and
[46:37] we really appreciate them
[46:39] they love and their love for the lord
[46:41] and the love for the people of god
[46:43] that's what counts
[46:45] and i believe that is what god has
[46:47] called them for to serve the bride of
[46:49] the living god
[46:51] and we want to say may god bless them
[46:54] and just continue to strengthen them and
[46:56] keep them strong in the faith of the
[46:58] lord
[46:59] for your sake as a church
[47:02] as moses arms became weak somebody had
[47:05] to lift them up
[47:06] and
[47:07] we know that we are in a battle
[47:10] you know this journey is a long journey
[47:12] but it's a wonderful journey
[47:14] a journey full of experiences
[47:17] full of joy
[47:19] full of the gladness of the lord
[47:22] but the lord is faithful in all things
[47:24] so we trust and we believe that he will
[47:27] help in all these things
[47:30] as we come together this morning
[47:32] amen
[47:34] i'm happy also for brother and paul and
[47:35] the family sister chappie to
[47:39] take good care of us and
[47:41] feed us and make sure we don't starve
[47:43] you know
[47:46] so far it's been going well
[47:48] they're actually overfeeding us at this
[47:49] stage
[47:51] but we appreciate them for their love
[47:53] and
[47:53] their kindness and just to be able to
[47:56] see them all again
[47:58] so may god bless you amen thank you
[48:01] let us stand and turn in our bibles this
[48:03] morning
[48:04] the philippians chapter 2 verse 5
[48:11] philippians chapter 2 verse 5.
[48:24] we really appreciate the songs of zion
[48:26] this morning
[48:27] just wonderful to create such an
[48:29] atmosphere
[48:31] because without the atmosphere that word
[48:33] of the lord can never flow
[48:35] but
[48:36] the importance of laying that foundation
[48:39] amen
[48:41] philippians 2 verse 5
[48:43] let this mind be in you
[48:45] which was also in christ jesus
[48:49] who being in the form of god thought it
[48:50] not robbery to be equal with god
[48:53] but made himself of no reputation
[48:56] and took upon him the form of his
[48:58] servant
[48:59] and was made in the likeness of men and
[49:02] being found in the fashion as a man he
[49:04] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[49:06] death
[49:07] even the death of the cross
[49:10] wherefore god also had highly exalted
[49:12] him
[49:12] and giving me a name which is above
[49:14] every name that that the name of jesus
[49:17] every knee should bow
[49:19] of things in heaven of things in earth
[49:21] and things under the earth
[49:23] that every tongue should confess that
[49:25] jesus christ is lord
[49:27] to the glory of god
[49:28] the father amen let's bow our heads
[49:31] again
[49:32] father as we bow in your presence one
[49:34] more time this morning
[49:36] we appreciate thee lord for thy presence
[49:39] we appreciate thee for thy unfailing
[49:41] word of promise
[49:42] we thank the lord that we can come
[49:44] together this morning lord with our cups
[49:46] raised high
[49:47] because you said oh father god whatever
[49:49] we desire you can complete that desire
[49:51] in our lives
[49:53] and so this morning lord we want to
[49:54] surrender ourselves this meeting
[49:56] everyone present here that you will be
[49:58] moving from person to person
[50:00] that your word will speak life into our
[50:02] hearts of god that you will quicken us o
[50:05] god closer unto thee o father and that
[50:07] your grace will be sufficient in our
[50:09] midst this morning we surrender the
[50:11] meeting to the asking thy hand of grace
[50:14] upon us all now asking thy presence in
[50:17] jesus christ's name amen and amen amen
[50:21] you may take your seeds
[50:29] amen wellington has got strange weather
[50:31] is that right
[50:33] last time we were here i said to the
[50:35] brothers no this weather is beautiful we
[50:37] have sunshine no wind nothing
[50:39] but this time around it's different
[50:42] but you know
[50:43] god is a god of variety
[50:45] so sometimes the wind must blow and
[50:48] sometimes the sun must shine and
[50:49] sometimes it must rain
[50:51] but we live through all these things
[50:53] more than victorious in christ jesus
[50:56] so i want to just talk to you this
[50:58] morning to have the mind of christ amen
[51:00] you know it's an expression
[51:03] as the bible teaches and as an
[51:04] expression let the mind be in you which
[51:07] was also in christ jesus
[51:10] now it's a crucial factor for every one
[51:11] of us to understand this morning that
[51:13] that god is an unchanging god and god's
[51:15] ways is not our ways
[51:17] it's it is a secret principle that every
[51:20] believer must remember every morning of
[51:22] your life you know my ways is not god's
[51:24] way god's ways which we're talking about
[51:26] your natural ways your natural mind the
[51:28] way you think the way you reason it is
[51:30] not god's way of reasoning it's not
[51:32] god's way of thinking and if we
[51:34] understand that principle it helps us to
[51:37] to face difficult situations it help us
[51:39] to make right decisions it help us to
[51:42] guide us along the journey of life
[51:45] because the prophet says
[51:47] we are human
[51:49] and all the worldly knowledge is no more
[51:51] than a canary brain
[51:53] amen so you can be the most cleverest
[51:55] person on the face of the earth
[51:57] you can be an einstein you can be
[51:59] somebody that can do mathematical genius
[52:02] work and and discover things but it's
[52:04] all a canary brain compared to god it is
[52:07] not even coming close to the capacity of
[52:10] the mind of god
[52:12] amen all that you do you will just hurt
[52:15] yourself with it you've got to have the
[52:17] mind of god so with your mind you will
[52:20] only hurt yourself
[52:21] once you realize that that even if i'm
[52:23] the most cleverest person in the church
[52:25] i can only hurt myself with that mind
[52:28] once you lay that aside and you realize
[52:30] you know this mind is going to hurt me
[52:32] yeah have you ever thought about it that
[52:33] way
[52:34] my mind is actually something that can
[52:36] hurt me
[52:37] it cannot bless me it cannot come close
[52:40] to the things of god it cannot achieve
[52:42] the things that god wants us to achieve
[52:45] then that takes some pressure off me
[52:47] because then i know i don't have to be
[52:48] clever in the worldly things i don't
[52:50] have to have an eye iq i don't have to
[52:52] have anything like that i have to have
[52:54] the mind of god
[52:56] that makes the difference in life
[52:58] because your own ideas will only hurt
[53:00] you
[53:02] and it's important to understand that
[53:04] amen 1 corinthians 11 verse 1
[53:08] he says be followers of me even as i am
[53:10] also of christ amen so the mind of
[53:13] christ brings a believer to its position
[53:17] the mind of christ reveals to you who
[53:20] you are what is your position in christ
[53:22] and in the world that we live in and it
[53:24] brings us stability amen it removes you
[53:27] from the spiritual amnesia and placing
[53:30] you into the full knowledge and
[53:31] understanding of who i am
[53:33] it is that that position that's why when
[53:35] paul says be followers of me even as i
[53:38] am of christ that is not the natural
[53:40] mind speaking amen that is not that is
[53:43] god's mind speaking that people will
[53:46] come and they will follow a man
[53:48] but into the world it would look like
[53:50] i'm following a man but from god's
[53:52] perspective i'm following god in the man
[53:55] that anointed gift that god is bringing
[53:57] forward
[53:58] that's why when people were following
[54:00] they followed paul but it wasn't paul
[54:02] they followed he says follow me as i
[54:04] follow christ not my own doing not my
[54:07] own ideas but as i follow christ you
[54:09] follow me
[54:11] and so every messenger came with that
[54:12] same inspiration be followers of me
[54:15] which doesn't mean
[54:16] be ye equal with me
[54:19] i mean be ye the same as me in that
[54:21] sense because when god is not the author
[54:24] of confusion
[54:25] that's why when he sends a messenger
[54:27] like paul there was not a second paul
[54:29] there was not a backup to paul there was
[54:31] not a number two to paul paul was number
[54:34] one and that's where it ends that's why
[54:36] he says do follow me and if i'm not
[54:38] there follow that one
[54:40] it is not like that in the mind of god
[54:41] because when god sends a messenger he is
[54:44] the only messenger for that age there is
[54:46] no replacement there is no second one
[54:48] there is no third one fourth one it is
[54:50] him and him alone
[54:52] amen so we have to understand that it
[54:54] brings a a principle of discipleship yes
[54:58] that's why when you become a disciple of
[55:00] jesus christ you become a follower
[55:02] a disciple becomes a learner of jesus
[55:06] christ amen not a somebody but you look
[55:08] at the master and the disciples desire
[55:11] is to be like the master
[55:14] man that's his greatest desire amen
[55:16] that's why they said lord teach us to
[55:17] preach teach us to bring teachers these
[55:20] things they didn't come with their own
[55:21] inspiration when they tried their own
[55:23] inspiration they got a big rebuke yeah
[55:26] that's right like one day jesus told
[55:27] them you know i'm the end is near
[55:31] i'm going to be killed yeah oh my my man
[55:34] and who got excited
[55:36] peter rolled up his sleeves and grabbed
[55:38] him and start to shake him oh my god i'm
[55:40] gonna cast out this demon from him
[55:43] and jesus said to him get behind me
[55:45] satan
[55:46] not to him but the anointing that tried
[55:48] to hinder the work of god
[55:49] and peter was a bit deflated but the
[55:52] principle of the disciple is to become
[55:55] like the master to become in the real
[55:58] sense not in pharisee or an actor but to
[56:00] be real in every essence to say if i can
[56:03] be like the master then i have achieved
[56:05] my discipleship i don't want to become
[56:08] more than the master i don't want to
[56:09] know more than jesus christ i don't want
[56:11] to know more than what he has revealed
[56:14] what he has become that's what i need to
[56:16] become
[56:17] amen
[56:18] so he says with the mind of christ you
[56:21] serve god
[56:23] the inward part the inward part you
[56:25] serve god the subconscious that's where
[56:28] faith lies amen so many times you know
[56:31] something is going to happen
[56:33] you get a thought you get an inspiration
[56:34] and it happens he says that's the mind
[56:36] of god that inspiration that works
[56:38] through us
[56:39] it comes from that deep sense that
[56:42] unconscious part where faith dwells that
[56:44] you can see things and things come to
[56:47] you now the christian looks at things
[56:49] that he doesn't see with his eyes
[56:51] for we look at the unseen
[56:54] you know with the inside eye you see by
[56:57] faith amen you see from that principle
[57:00] because the whole christian armor is an
[57:03] unseen armor
[57:05] not one of the christian armor is seen
[57:07] armor
[57:08] you don't walk in here with big swords
[57:09] on your side
[57:11] big helmets
[57:12] people like to make it seen and that's
[57:14] why they like the physical expression
[57:15] some churches they bring big horns and
[57:17] they blow horns i don't know if you have
[57:19] it here but by us you know they like
[57:20] that expression they blow horns and they
[57:23] do funny things
[57:24] because i want to see the natural armor
[57:27] but god's armor is not a synonym
[57:29] it is a complete unseen armor so as you
[57:33] sit here this morning you are equipped
[57:34] with certain armor to fight this battle
[57:37] but it's an unseen armor is that's why
[57:40] you when i look at you i see faith when
[57:42] i look at you i see the expression of
[57:44] god's grace
[57:45] but it's not physical but from the
[57:47] inside amen because paul said i serve
[57:50] god with my mind but with but my flesh
[57:54] from the natural mind my flesh serves
[57:56] the flesh but from the inside of the
[57:59] mind of god i serve god
[58:02] so there's always a war inside of you
[58:04] there's a natural part and there's a
[58:06] spiritual part
[58:07] that's why with your natural mind you
[58:09] cannot understand the things of god
[58:13] never ever and it's very important so
[58:15] what is in the mind of god as the
[58:17] prophet comes he says let me take you
[58:19] into the back parts of the man the mind
[58:21] of god let me take you before god was
[58:23] god let me take you before there was a
[58:25] world let me take you hundreds and
[58:27] billions of years before there was time
[58:29] and he take us back into the mind of god
[58:32] that's only a prophet that can do that
[58:34] because he gets that inspiration from
[58:36] the mind of god and he can tell you what
[58:38] happened in the garden of eden exactly
[58:41] he will tell you how the serpent
[58:42] operated and how they were kicked out of
[58:44] the garden and how they were crying and
[58:46] he can even describe to you the emotions
[58:48] that you can see with your own spiritual
[58:51] eyes see man what a scene
[58:54] that was not a good storyteller
[58:56] that was not somebody that just put
[58:58] something together it is the mind of god
[59:00] in a prophet just going back right in
[59:03] time and then bringing that back in a
[59:05] reality for us that it is a real
[59:07] happening that you can say i believe it
[59:10] everything that he has done
[59:12] remember god has always had a plan of
[59:15] redemption the prophet says he has
[59:17] always had a plan of redemption and
[59:19] that's been through the blood
[59:21] ever since the very beginning and the
[59:23] dawn of time perceived in the mind of
[59:25] god before the world ever came into
[59:27] existence
[59:29] now i want you to get this now he says
[59:31] that before this certain thing called
[59:33] the new birth ever happened to man he
[59:36] cannot no way at all understand or even
[59:39] understand god
[59:41] no man
[59:42] can understand god
[59:45] i don't care who you are
[59:47] in the natural sense
[59:49] no way at all understand or even
[59:51] understand god or have any knowledge of
[59:54] god
[59:55] though the word speaks it his mind
[59:58] cannot comprehend it because it's a
[1:00:01] human mind
[1:00:03] so you can sit under the word for 100
[1:00:06] years
[1:00:06] and you will still not understand god
[1:00:08] because the human mind cannot comprehend
[1:00:11] it he's got to have the mind of god in
[1:00:14] him to understand godly things
[1:00:16] all the reading all the school all the
[1:00:18] teaching as good as that may be yet it's
[1:00:21] not the real principle yet
[1:00:23] amen he says because we cannot even
[1:00:26] interpret one another's mind
[1:00:29] amen
[1:00:30] i can look at your brother like i know
[1:00:32] what you're thinking
[1:00:33] you're smiling yeah yeah
[1:00:35] so i'm starting to think what can you
[1:00:37] think
[1:00:38] i'm trying to interpret
[1:00:40] you cannot tell me what i'm thinking
[1:00:42] right now
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:44] i'm thinking brother andy's got a nice
[1:00:46] jacket on
[1:00:47] you would never have thought that
[1:00:50] so what is the principle you cannot
[1:00:52] interpret another human's mind
[1:00:54] now imagine you're trying to interpret
[1:00:56] god's mind
[1:00:57] with that same mind that you have this
[1:00:59] morning that god has blessed you that
[1:01:01] you can walk and talk and worship god
[1:01:03] from in the body but there's no
[1:01:05] interpretation from that principle and
[1:01:07] that's why it is an important foundation
[1:01:10] to really understand
[1:01:12] the principle that god works from amen
[1:01:16] god interprets his own mind
[1:01:18] now let's go to jeremiah 29 from verse 1
[1:01:20] just as a background
[1:01:23] you see the way that god operates
[1:01:32] jeremiah 29 1 it's a letter
[1:01:34] that jeremiah sent written to those that
[1:01:37] were in exile
[1:01:39] taken away into babylon captivity
[1:01:42] now these are the words of the letter
[1:01:43] that jeremiah the prophet sent from
[1:01:45] jerusalem unto the residue of the elders
[1:01:47] which were carried away captives
[1:01:50] and to the priest and to the prophets
[1:01:52] and to all the people whom
[1:01:52] nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive
[1:01:54] from jerusalem to babylon
[1:01:57] after that joking the king and the queen
[1:01:59] and the eunuchs and the princes of judah
[1:02:01] and jerusalem and the carpenters and the
[1:02:03] smiths were departed from jerusalem by
[1:02:06] the hand of elisha the son of safram and
[1:02:08] gerema the son of hillary whom zedekiah
[1:02:10] the king of judah went unto babylon to
[1:02:12] nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon
[1:02:14] saying thus saith the lord of hosts the
[1:02:16] god of israel unto all that are carried
[1:02:18] away captive whom i have caused to be
[1:02:20] carried away from jerusalem and to
[1:02:22] babylon
[1:02:23] so what is god telling them is telling
[1:02:25] them i have caused you to be taken
[1:02:27] captive
[1:02:28] because remember we sitting in
[1:02:30] situations and your mind that where does
[1:02:32] the devil work
[1:02:34] amen
[1:02:36] so you're sitting there and things
[1:02:37] happen to you
[1:02:39] and while things happen there's another
[1:02:40] preacher that comes which is called the
[1:02:42] devil and he's a good preacher
[1:02:44] don't underestimate him he can tell you
[1:02:46] things which sounds reasonable
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:50] so he says thus save the lord the god of
[1:02:52] israel and to all that i carried away
[1:02:54] captive whom i of course to be carried
[1:02:55] away from so god makes it sure that they
[1:02:58] understand is not your own doing it's
[1:02:59] not this or that it is me that has done
[1:03:01] the following
[1:03:03] because it places it things in order it
[1:03:06] places in the right perspective because
[1:03:08] once you get the right perspective it
[1:03:10] takes pressure from you
[1:03:12] now look what it tells them
[1:03:14] in captivity in their current situation
[1:03:18] birdy houses
[1:03:20] dwell in them and plant gardens and eat
[1:03:22] the fruit of them
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:25] take your wives and begot sons and
[1:03:28] daughters and take wives for your sons
[1:03:30] and give your daughters to husbands that
[1:03:32] they may bear sons and daughters that
[1:03:34] you may be increased there and not
[1:03:36] diminished
[1:03:37] and seek the peace of the city where the
[1:03:39] i have caused you to be carried away
[1:03:42] and pray unto the lord for it for in the
[1:03:45] peace thereof shall you have peace
[1:03:48] it is a
[1:03:49] wisdom a principle from god yeah you
[1:03:51] know what would we do we would say manly
[1:03:53] i'm captive yeah i'm not i don't want to
[1:03:55] be here they've captured me against my
[1:03:56] will i'll fight them
[1:03:58] every day i'll fight them i'll fight the
[1:04:00] government i'll fight every organization
[1:04:02] i'll fight every because i i'm not from
[1:04:04] here i'm going to heaven
[1:04:07] but god says why are you here pray for
[1:04:09] the government pray for your city pray
[1:04:11] for the people because the peace that
[1:04:13] you pray down is your blessing
[1:04:15] it is your blessing don't think i'm
[1:04:17] gonna be a vigilante
[1:04:19] man i'll become an underground movement
[1:04:22] i'll fight every unevil spirit in the
[1:04:24] end time man i'll show you by blood
[1:04:27] because even when jesus called his
[1:04:29] disciples he called different ones
[1:04:31] he didn't call them all out of the same
[1:04:33] church
[1:04:34] thinking the same man having the same
[1:04:36] attitude if i would call my deacons and
[1:04:39] trustees i want them all to think like
[1:04:40] me
[1:04:42] and that will make my life easy
[1:04:44] [Laughter]
[1:04:45] if i say we're going left they say amen
[1:04:48] you know and so we do but no jesus he
[1:04:51] called a tax collector yeah
[1:04:54] man i would never call a tax collector
[1:04:56] because everybody hates a tax collector
[1:04:59] and then he calls another one simon the
[1:05:01] zealot next to him
[1:05:03] now simon the zealot was a vigilante he
[1:05:06] was a killer a murderer of the roman
[1:05:08] system they believed god gave us the
[1:05:10] right to kill every room
[1:05:12] now the tax collector and the simon
[1:05:15] sitting next to other next to jesus
[1:05:18] so when jesus says you pay taxes
[1:05:20] matthew says amen
[1:05:24] amen and so you can see the dynamics
[1:05:26] that's why when god calls the church
[1:05:28] together we are each one different and
[1:05:30] unique in the right sense
[1:05:32] because god wants us to be that way he
[1:05:35] doesn't want us all to be the same he
[1:05:36] wants us all to be the same in loving
[1:05:38] him but in your own natural way to be an
[1:05:41] expression
[1:05:42] some of us can be quiet
[1:05:44] some others can be expressive
[1:05:46] some of us can be this and that but god
[1:05:49] calls us together
[1:05:50] as a family
[1:05:52] so we pray for those things god tells
[1:05:54] them to pray for that city
[1:05:57] where i have pleased you yes because
[1:05:59] their peace
[1:06:01] will be your blessing
[1:06:02] amen now he says verse 2 verse 8
[1:06:06] for thus have the lord of hosts the god
[1:06:08] of israel let not your prophets and your
[1:06:10] diviners that be in the midst of you
[1:06:11] deceive you
[1:06:13] neither hearken to your dreams which you
[1:06:15] cause to be dream for they prophesy
[1:06:17] falsely unto you in my name
[1:06:19] i have not sent them
[1:06:21] say of the lord for thus say of the lord
[1:06:23] that this that after 70 years be
[1:06:26] accomplished that babylon i will visit
[1:06:28] you
[1:06:28] and perform my good work towards you in
[1:06:31] causing you to return to this place
[1:06:34] so what was happening there was prophets
[1:06:36] and people coming up to say man
[1:06:38] we're going to take over this country
[1:06:41] we're going to overthrow this we're
[1:06:42] going to do this you know god is going
[1:06:43] to deliver us very soon and that caused
[1:06:47] them to have the wrong perspective of
[1:06:49] what they are busy doing yeah that's why
[1:06:52] if somebody comes and say man
[1:06:54] uh the rapture is upon us let's sell
[1:06:57] everything we
[1:06:58] have right
[1:06:59] and let's go and live on a mountain for
[1:07:01] for a year or two
[1:07:02] it is the wrong perspective
[1:07:04] because that's not what god gave us
[1:07:06] he says you plant your potatoes
[1:07:09] every day of your life
[1:07:11] because when the rapture comes some of
[1:07:12] you yours gonna be at work
[1:07:14] he says there's two in the field i'll
[1:07:16] take one i'll leave one
[1:07:18] it doesn't say all of you will be
[1:07:19] isolated on a mountain he says you will
[1:07:21] be where is he working laying floors or
[1:07:23] painting a wall then the rapture will
[1:07:25] happen so we gonna work until jesus
[1:07:28] comes naturally and spiritually it's
[1:07:30] never going to stop
[1:07:32] amen
[1:07:33] but those false prophets false diviners
[1:07:37] came and they gave them another
[1:07:38] perspective
[1:07:40] now he says i will wait till my time is
[1:07:43] for food
[1:07:44] and when my time is fulfilled then i
[1:07:47] will take you back to that land
[1:07:49] i remember when we were saved 30 years
[1:07:51] back
[1:07:53] god came in our lives in a mighty way
[1:07:55] and
[1:07:57] we were just saved and baptized and sat
[1:07:59] in the church
[1:08:00] and i said to sister it was a man we
[1:08:02] just made it
[1:08:04] i can't believe that god just waited for
[1:08:06] me
[1:08:08] because i can see the rapture is upon us
[1:08:10] and it was true
[1:08:12] but that's already 30 years back
[1:08:14] but today i'm glad god waited because
[1:08:17] after me many souls were added to the
[1:08:19] same body of christ
[1:08:22] don't be selfish don't think it's about
[1:08:24] you it's about the body of christ if we
[1:08:26] must mate another 100 years we wait
[1:08:29] if it's tomorrow we are happy if it's
[1:08:31] after tomorrow we're also happy but
[1:08:33] let's have that right attitude to say
[1:08:35] lord not upon my will but your will be
[1:08:37] done when the last one comes in the body
[1:08:40] is complete then we're going home
[1:08:42] so the fact that we're here this morning
[1:08:44] means the body is not complete
[1:08:46] that's all
[1:08:47] so we are patiently waiting looking for
[1:08:49] the last one i thought i was the last
[1:08:51] one but i was wrong
[1:08:54] imagine if i was the last one many of
[1:08:55] you would not be safe this morning
[1:08:57] that would have been terrible
[1:09:00] but god says no i know my own yes
[1:09:02] and we have to wait
[1:09:04] patiently
[1:09:06] patiently upon god yes amen and so the
[1:09:09] devil comes and he tries to influence
[1:09:11] our minds to push us away then look at
[1:09:14] the conclusion he says in verse 11 for i
[1:09:16] know the thoughts
[1:09:18] so he's comforting them with thoughts
[1:09:20] they are in exile they're under pressure
[1:09:22] they are rejected but i know the
[1:09:23] thoughts that i think towards you
[1:09:25] thoughts of peace
[1:09:27] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:09:29] end
[1:09:31] amen so god's thoughts never changes so
[1:09:34] there's a constant divine flow of
[1:09:37] thoughts from god's mind to us as a
[1:09:39] church
[1:09:40] it never stops it is permanent
[1:09:44] amen as the psalmist says i am poor and
[1:09:47] needy yet the lord thinketh upon me
[1:09:50] amen so it's a constant yielding of of
[1:09:54] thoughts
[1:09:55] now the people in judah were under
[1:09:57] pressure they were under under under
[1:09:59] some danger
[1:10:01] because when false things comes your way
[1:10:04] it creates danger
[1:10:06] amen
[1:10:07] the first one they were they were kept
[1:10:10] afloat by false hopes
[1:10:12] right
[1:10:13] people were telling them man don't worry
[1:10:15] the rapture is next week just just hold
[1:10:18] on
[1:10:19] or giving them certain things which
[1:10:22] wasn't from the mind of god but those
[1:10:24] gave them some some hope which was not a
[1:10:26] correct hope
[1:10:28] your hope your faith must be based upon
[1:10:30] the word of god
[1:10:31] not upon what somebody promised you or
[1:10:33] can deliver to you or you know if i can
[1:10:35] just wait another month i'm gonna hang
[1:10:37] on there because then i'll make it
[1:10:39] it's not about you hanging on it's about
[1:10:41] god holding you it is not you hanging on
[1:10:44] it's god having you
[1:10:47] so that first one was the false hopes
[1:10:49] created by those false prophets
[1:10:52] and the second danger was to go in total
[1:10:54] despair yeah
[1:10:56] that's the dangers we are you're either
[1:10:58] going to hang on to false hopes or
[1:11:00] you're going to go into total despair to
[1:11:01] say no i can't take it anymore
[1:11:04] i can't live i can't do this anymore i'm
[1:11:06] sick and tired of this life you know
[1:11:08] that false despair that comes upon you
[1:11:11] but then in the midst of that there's a
[1:11:13] reality
[1:11:14] the mind of god is the sustaining power
[1:11:16] that that revelation
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:20] but god says to them in the that's why
[1:11:22] he explains to them the false prophets
[1:11:24] the things that they are not doing and
[1:11:26] then he says
[1:11:27] but i've thought towards you
[1:11:29] because when you start to think about
[1:11:31] the thoughts of god
[1:11:32] it gives you stability it gives you
[1:11:34] strength it gives you something on the
[1:11:36] internal and you cannot think about the
[1:11:38] thought of god with your own mind
[1:11:40] because your own mind will deceive you
[1:11:41] you have to go to the word of god and to
[1:11:43] say what are these thoughts that god
[1:11:45] thinks towards me
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:48] you cannot do it otherwise
[1:11:50] so we are not to live in the false hopes
[1:11:53] of the world
[1:11:54] all the false hopes that we ourselves
[1:11:56] devise
[1:11:58] we many times like to devise false hopes
[1:12:00] for ourselves
[1:12:01] don't live on that because it's temporal
[1:12:04] you have to live upon a reality the only
[1:12:06] sustaining power is the word of god
[1:12:09] those thoughts that he revealed to us
[1:12:11] amen because we can in despair in trials
[1:12:14] of loneliness trials of of of rejection
[1:12:17] and many things we are exposed to so
[1:12:19] what are false hopes
[1:12:21] false hopes and things like my works
[1:12:23] will save me
[1:12:24] man i'm gonna work just a little harder
[1:12:26] than i feel better yeah your works can
[1:12:28] never save you
[1:12:30] you can work every day of your life for
[1:12:32] the kingdom of god it does not make you
[1:12:34] saved you are saved by grace and by
[1:12:37] grace alone nothing else can save you
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:41] another fault hope is my church will
[1:12:43] save me
[1:12:45] a church can never save you a church is
[1:12:47] a safe haven it's a place where we
[1:12:48] congregate together it is important to
[1:12:51] have a home church but the church does
[1:12:52] not save you jesus christ save you and
[1:12:55] then he places you upon a body that you
[1:12:57] can be a benefit to that body
[1:13:00] amen false teachings that creates false
[1:13:04] expectations
[1:13:05] is a problem that people hang on to
[1:13:07] people that they hang on to if you hang
[1:13:09] on to a person and that person die you
[1:13:11] in trouble yeah that's right imagine
[1:13:14] here's the followers of the message yeah
[1:13:17] i wasn't in the message then when the
[1:13:19] prophet died
[1:13:21] but imagine you were a follower of this
[1:13:22] message
[1:13:24] and yeah the news comes
[1:13:26] the prophet is dead
[1:13:28] the devastation
[1:13:29] if you listen to those testimonies
[1:13:31] they were so convinced that god is gonna
[1:13:33] raise him from the dead yeah
[1:13:35] they actually postponed the burial they
[1:13:37] did many you know you can read between
[1:13:39] the lines how they how they how they
[1:13:40] tried and had their own interpretations
[1:13:43] and because how is it possible that god
[1:13:44] can take the last prophet of the earth
[1:13:47] how is it possible the mind cannot
[1:13:50] understand it i cannot even understand
[1:13:51] it because i would have loved him to be
[1:13:53] still alive today oh yeah
[1:13:55] because i will if i've got a question
[1:13:57] i'll pick up the phone and send her
[1:13:58] what's up
[1:14:01] i've got this dream i've got this
[1:14:03] question i'll tap into that source
[1:14:05] because it was for me
[1:14:07] it was a blessing a gift for me i will
[1:14:08] use it to the fullest right
[1:14:11] i won't be ashamed i won't no i'll be
[1:14:13] there i'll be you know but god then says
[1:14:15] this is the line and he takes him off
[1:14:17] the scene
[1:14:18] now those people that were heavily
[1:14:20] dependent upon him now he's shaken
[1:14:23] shaken to the roots to say but what's
[1:14:25] going to happen to the message now how
[1:14:27] is it going to go they could not
[1:14:28] understand but here we are many many
[1:14:31] years later and that same word is still
[1:14:32] alive moving forward because it's not a
[1:14:35] man-made system it is from the throne of
[1:14:38] god to you
[1:14:43] it would have died so many years back
[1:14:45] when the prophet died in 65 it would
[1:14:47] have been finished that's right but
[1:14:49] that's when it started to spread across
[1:14:51] the world that's where the power then
[1:14:52] became because he decreased and now
[1:14:54] jesus increased in our lives
[1:14:57] because if the prophet was still here
[1:14:59] today we would have focused on the wrong
[1:15:01] thing amen so god brings the man like
[1:15:03] john on the scene he delivers the word
[1:15:05] identifies the word and then he takes
[1:15:07] him off
[1:15:08] because he doesn't walk with two of them
[1:15:10] at the same time
[1:15:11] amen so you can see the mind of god
[1:15:14] our mind would they say lord keep him
[1:15:15] alive till the rapture
[1:15:17] we need it
[1:15:18] we need jesus christ in our lives we
[1:15:20] need the mind of god in our lives amen
[1:15:24] ephesians 1 from verse 9
[1:15:27] ephesians chapter 1 from verse 9
[1:15:35] the mind of god
[1:15:37] ephesians chapter 1 verse 9
[1:15:40] we can see that god has got away
[1:15:42] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:15:44] his will
[1:15:45] according to his good pleasure which you
[1:15:47] have purposed in himself
[1:15:50] verse 10. that in the dispensation of
[1:15:53] the fullness of time he might gather
[1:15:55] together in one all things in christ
[1:15:58] both which were in heaven and which on
[1:16:00] earth even in him
[1:16:03] in water we have obtained an inheritance
[1:16:06] being predestinated according to the
[1:16:08] purpose of him work all things after the
[1:16:12] council of his own will amen so god has
[1:16:15] got a council yeah and his council is
[1:16:18] his mind his will the thoughts that he
[1:16:20] had
[1:16:21] he always goes back to that
[1:16:23] he never forgets that when moses and
[1:16:25] them were in trouble after 400 years the
[1:16:27] burning bush came along and met moses
[1:16:30] and says i have remembered the promise
[1:16:32] that i made to my people that i will not
[1:16:34] forget about them
[1:16:35] amen his counsel of his own will
[1:16:38] now god is ever conscious of his
[1:16:40] thoughts
[1:16:41] against me and you the thoughts that he
[1:16:43] thinks about you is ever conscious of
[1:16:46] those thoughts
[1:16:47] we are always before his mind
[1:16:50] he never ceases to think about us
[1:16:52] his thoughts are so much higher than the
[1:16:55] thoughts we have
[1:16:56] and he's got all these promises that we
[1:16:59] can understand
[1:17:01] now the experiences of god's people in
[1:17:03] babylon made them think that the lord
[1:17:05] has forgotten to be mindful of them
[1:17:08] because how you want to tell me god is
[1:17:10] mindful of me when he exiled me
[1:17:13] he took me from my homeland
[1:17:14] he dropped me from my children he did
[1:17:17] this and that to me you want to tell me
[1:17:18] that's the mindfulness of god
[1:17:21] i cannot understand it that's why your
[1:17:23] mind is an enemy
[1:17:25] because our mindfulness is put him in a
[1:17:27] glass box lock the door no harm no evil
[1:17:30] no summer no winter everything perfect
[1:17:32] no problems nothing no diseases no
[1:17:34] nothing that's mindful of god that i
[1:17:36] like i like god to be mindful of me that
[1:17:38] nothing ever happens to me that i'm
[1:17:40] perfect you know and everything is just
[1:17:42] fine and no problems no diseases no no
[1:17:45] test no trials it is that's the
[1:17:46] mindfulness that i like
[1:17:48] as a human
[1:17:50] because if i'm blessed of the lord
[1:17:51] nothing must happen to me
[1:17:53] if i am the child the chosen of the king
[1:17:55] i must walk like the king and nothing
[1:17:57] must touch me
[1:17:58] but there says god says i'm mindful of
[1:18:01] you yet he has put them in exile i am
[1:18:03] mindful of you yet they are under
[1:18:05] pressure i am mindful of you yet they
[1:18:07] are not where they want to be they cry
[1:18:09] every day lord take us back
[1:18:11] but he says i am mindful of you because
[1:18:14] i've got thoughts of peace towards you
[1:18:17] peace towards you how is that peace when
[1:18:19] i'm in exile
[1:18:20] how is that peace when i am here living
[1:18:22] in 2022 in an ungodly godly places
[1:18:27] among ungodly people
[1:18:29] how is that mindful
[1:18:30] but god says i am mindful of you i have
[1:18:33] not forgotten about you amen amen they
[1:18:36] were acts out from their land of promise
[1:18:39] how could these events indicate that god
[1:18:42] thought about them in kindness
[1:18:45] you see already your mind
[1:18:46] cannot comprehend that
[1:18:49] that's why i'm saying
[1:18:50] this morning if you can just realize
[1:18:52] that
[1:18:53] that my mind cannot comprehend god's
[1:18:55] kindness
[1:18:56] because i've got a human kindness and
[1:18:58] i've got a godly kindness
[1:19:00] i've got a human peace and i've got a
[1:19:02] godly peace it's two different things
[1:19:04] you cannot even compare them
[1:19:06] amen and they were tempted to ask
[1:19:10] that did god care at all for me
[1:19:13] it's temptations that come our way
[1:19:15] did god forget about me
[1:19:17] did he forget about me
[1:19:19] psalms 139 verse 17
[1:19:26] psalms 139 verse 17
[1:19:29] he says how precious also are thy
[1:19:31] thoughts unto me
[1:19:33] now it's an expression
[1:19:35] how precious
[1:19:36] are they thoughts unto me
[1:19:38] how great is the sum of them
[1:19:41] if i should count them they are more
[1:19:43] than the number of the sand
[1:19:45] when i'm awake i am still with thee
[1:19:47] so god's thoughts to you as an
[1:19:49] individual is more than the sands of the
[1:19:51] sea
[1:19:52] that's billions upon billions upon
[1:19:54] billions of thoughts for you
[1:19:56] it's precious it's something that he
[1:19:58] thinks about you just to know that he
[1:20:00] knows about me brings her peace
[1:20:03] so what does this mind of god in you
[1:20:05] produces
[1:20:06] because remember if paul says have the
[1:20:08] mind of god inside of you it must
[1:20:09] produce results
[1:20:11] if i have the mind of einstein i will do
[1:20:13] mathematical things for you this morning
[1:20:16] i will open the blackboard and i'll
[1:20:18] start to write x y z and we will do math
[1:20:21] because i can only but express what's in
[1:20:22] my mind yeah
[1:20:24] and so if i was a teacher a music
[1:20:25] teacher i'll move behind the drums i'll
[1:20:27] say look at the f this is f this is c
[1:20:29] this is b
[1:20:31] move from here there because this will
[1:20:33] pull me
[1:20:34] because it's in my mind
[1:20:36] so that's the same thing he says with
[1:20:38] god when the mind of god comes into you
[1:20:40] what does it produce
[1:20:42] what does it what does it bring forth
[1:20:45] the mind of god in you is not there to
[1:20:47] make you an intellectual genius on the
[1:20:49] message
[1:20:50] it's not there to make you a quota of
[1:20:52] the message it's not there to give you
[1:20:54] intellectual knowledge of the seven
[1:20:55] seals and seven thunders it's there to
[1:20:58] give you a life in victory
[1:21:01] amen
[1:21:02] so the mind of christ brings things to
[1:21:04] us
[1:21:05] the first thing that it does it's a mind
[1:21:08] of sacrifice
[1:21:09] the mind of christ brings sacrifices
[1:21:12] that you are willing to sacrifice your
[1:21:14] own ideas
[1:21:15] that you are willing to lay down your
[1:21:17] own ideas to say that is my own ideas
[1:21:19] does not count anymore
[1:21:22] but it's a
[1:21:23] sacrifice
[1:21:25] that's why roman says your body is a
[1:21:27] living sacrifice
[1:21:29] you can only do that if you have the
[1:21:30] mind of god
[1:21:32] if you don't have the mind of god you
[1:21:33] will never become a living sacrifice
[1:21:35] because you will hang on to your own
[1:21:36] ideas
[1:21:37] you will not sacrifice
[1:21:40] next thing he says the mind of christ
[1:21:41] brings a mind of humility
[1:21:44] to be humble
[1:21:45] to be humbled above everything let's go
[1:21:48] to luke chapter 14
[1:21:50] verse 8
[1:21:52] because remember james says humble
[1:21:54] yourself in the sight of the lord and he
[1:21:56] shall lift you up
[1:21:58] a believer that has the mind of christ
[1:22:00] is not fighting for position
[1:22:02] i don't want to fight for my position
[1:22:04] because when god gives me my position
[1:22:06] it's an eternal position amen when god
[1:22:08] places me in the church nobody can place
[1:22:10] me out
[1:22:11] you know when somebody places you in
[1:22:12] another man will places you out but when
[1:22:14] god places you it's eternal
[1:22:17] into heavenly places
[1:22:19] luke chapter 14 verse 8
[1:22:22] he says when they are arbited
[1:22:24] of any man to a wedding
[1:22:28] sit not down in the highest room
[1:22:30] amen
[1:22:31] so when you are caught you want to sit
[1:22:33] at the main table
[1:22:35] is that right because that shows your
[1:22:37] importance
[1:22:39] when you walk into a venue you look for
[1:22:40] the best seat in the house and you go
[1:22:41] and plant yourself there
[1:22:43] because i'm a son of the king
[1:22:46] no he says when you go to a wedding
[1:22:49] sit not down in the highest room lest a
[1:22:51] more honourable man than thou be
[1:22:52] burdened of him
[1:22:54] and he that bathed thee and him come and
[1:22:56] say to thee give this man place that
[1:22:58] thou began with shame to take the lowest
[1:23:00] room
[1:23:01] so imagine how embarrassed that is
[1:23:04] you move to the main table brother and
[1:23:05] paul
[1:23:06] and the guest of honor comes and he taps
[1:23:08] you on the shoulder you know come come
[1:23:09] sit at the back there there's yours
[1:23:12] so you moved up with proud and arrogancy
[1:23:13] but when you move down you move down
[1:23:15] with humility
[1:23:16] you've been humbled
[1:23:18] because the main man doesn't see you fit
[1:23:19] for the big table
[1:23:21] he says that's the human character the
[1:23:23] human character always wants to be
[1:23:24] somebody special yeah man if they can
[1:23:26] just appreciate me for what i can do for
[1:23:28] this church and the ability i can bring
[1:23:31] you know all those mind thoughts there
[1:23:33] were places in us
[1:23:35] amen
[1:23:37] now in verse 10 he says
[1:23:39] but when they are buried go and sit down
[1:23:41] in the lowest room
[1:23:43] that when he that paid thee cometh he
[1:23:45] may say unto thee friend
[1:23:47] go up higher
[1:23:48] then shall i have worship in the
[1:23:50] presence of them that sit and meet with
[1:23:51] thee
[1:23:52] for whomsoever ever exalteth himself
[1:23:54] shall be abased and he that humble
[1:23:57] himself shall be exalted amen that's why
[1:23:59] the prophet says
[1:24:01] eternal life is to live for others
[1:24:04] so if you ever want to please god humble
[1:24:06] yourself don't lift yourself up see how
[1:24:08] humble you can become
[1:24:10] because then god will lift you up
[1:24:12] the mind of christ brings a mind of
[1:24:14] obedience so you can start to see if i
[1:24:17] have the holy ghost the mind of christ i
[1:24:19] will be a sacrificial life i will be a
[1:24:21] faithful life i will be obedience a life
[1:24:25] of obedience to the word of god amen
[1:24:27] because that is how the scriptures teach
[1:24:29] us because it brings obedience
[1:24:32] because unbelief will always
[1:24:34] misinterpret the act of god
[1:24:37] unbelief will always see the act of god
[1:24:39] as a punishment
[1:24:40] as a problem as something but faith says
[1:24:44] amen to every word amen faith believes
[1:24:48] the word of god faith brings it to the
[1:24:51] reality
[1:24:52] that we can understand the principles of
[1:24:54] god
[1:24:55] 1 peter 4 verse 1.
[1:25:04] is that the rain coming down
[1:25:06] thank god for rain
[1:25:08] one peter 4 was one
[1:25:11] for as much then as christ have suffered
[1:25:13] for us in the flesh
[1:25:15] arm yourself likewise with the same mind
[1:25:18] for he that suffered in the flesh have
[1:25:20] seen from sin that he no longer should
[1:25:22] live with the rest of his time in the
[1:25:24] flesh to the lust of men but to the will
[1:25:26] of god
[1:25:27] so if your flesh is still ruling you you
[1:25:29] have not
[1:25:30] armed yourself with the mind of god
[1:25:33] he says arm yourself which then means
[1:25:35] the mind of god is a weapon
[1:25:38] a weapon of mass destruction a weapon
[1:25:41] that can con that can defeat any demon
[1:25:44] it is arm yourself with that mind so if
[1:25:47] the enemy comes because if you arm
[1:25:48] yourself with the mind and the flesh
[1:25:50] rises up you can fight him you can put
[1:25:53] him in its place because the mind of
[1:25:55] christ then becomes the ruler in your
[1:25:56] heart
[1:25:58] so the mind is a weapon
[1:26:01] arm yourself
[1:26:02] not with your own mind
[1:26:04] but with the mind of christ
[1:26:06] because when you're in trouble then your
[1:26:08] reference becomes the word
[1:26:10] what does the word say about this
[1:26:12] because remember the word is the mind of
[1:26:14] christ amen the word is every thought
[1:26:16] that god put down for us he says those
[1:26:18] words were written from the mind of god
[1:26:20] it becomes word and then he puts it down
[1:26:22] in the bible
[1:26:24] isaiah 26 3 thou will keep him in
[1:26:26] perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon
[1:26:29] thee
[1:26:30] because he trusteth in thee so if you've
[1:26:33] put your mind to trust in god he says
[1:26:36] you will have perfect peace
[1:26:38] perfect peace in the midst of trouble
[1:26:41] in the midst of disaster you will have
[1:26:42] perfect peace
[1:26:44] amen but now as god is eternal the
[1:26:47] prophet says and he was the perfect
[1:26:49] perfect love perfect peace perfect joy
[1:26:51] perfect satisfaction all those seven
[1:26:53] spirits as we get in revelation they
[1:26:55] came out was made up of god was
[1:26:57] perfection
[1:26:58] everything else outside of that has been
[1:27:00] something that's been perverted
[1:27:02] now the only way that we can come back
[1:27:04] to perfection is to come back with that
[1:27:06] perfection which is god then we come to
[1:27:09] perfection then we have eternal life
[1:27:12] without ant without anything it's just
[1:27:14] forever eternal life
[1:27:16] amen so that's why he says no weapon
[1:27:18] formed against you will prosper
[1:27:21] because you've got an arm that you've
[1:27:23] armed yourself with
[1:27:24] you've got a weapon that you armed
[1:27:26] yourself with which is the mind of god
[1:27:28] so if the nep
[1:27:30] forms a weapon against you you fight him
[1:27:32] with that
[1:27:33] armor that you've got which the mind of
[1:27:36] god is an important part of because you
[1:27:38] can then discern him and look at all
[1:27:41] these things that he brings up against
[1:27:44] us
[1:27:44] so what kind of a piece are we talking
[1:27:46] about
[1:27:47] we're not talking about a piece
[1:27:49] that there's no problems yeah that's
[1:27:51] right right you've got a man-made piece
[1:27:53] every year they sign peace treaties man
[1:27:55] the world governments come together all
[1:27:57] the big presidents of every big major
[1:27:59] nation come together they sit in a room
[1:28:01] they argue their reason and when they
[1:28:02] leave they sign a peace treaty
[1:28:05] and when they go back is there peace
[1:28:07] no everybody feels better because
[1:28:09] there's a peace treaty but there's no
[1:28:10] peace because it's a man-made peace a
[1:28:13] man made peace can never bring peace but
[1:28:15] he says you as a child of god will have
[1:28:17] peace amongst the greatest trouble you
[1:28:19] will have peace in your heart you will
[1:28:21] have peace in your mind you will be
[1:28:23] peaceful thank you you will have
[1:28:25] problems but you will be at peace
[1:28:27] now that's a paradox that's the mind of
[1:28:29] god
[1:28:30] amen why is that because the bible says
[1:28:32] christ made peace for you
[1:28:35] he made peace
[1:28:36] colossians colossians 1 20
[1:28:39] and having made peace through the blood
[1:28:41] of his cross
[1:28:43] so there was no peace for you i'm not
[1:28:44] talking worldly peace i'm talking godly
[1:28:46] peace he says but jesus made peace when
[1:28:49] he died on the cross he paid for peace
[1:28:52] peace that you know if whatever happens
[1:28:54] to me my footsteps are for ordained of
[1:28:56] the lord nothing can happen to me that
[1:28:58] god has not allowed not even a hair from
[1:29:01] my head can drop to the ground because
[1:29:03] god is my god i belong to him he bought
[1:29:05] me on the cross
[1:29:07] when satan comes to me there's a big
[1:29:09] board on me on my head here you can't
[1:29:11] see it but it's there
[1:29:13] bought by the blood
[1:29:15] property of jesus christ
[1:29:17] the way i walk i'm not my own i have
[1:29:19] lost my own ability i've lost my own
[1:29:21] mind i belong to jesus christ and when i
[1:29:24] walk down the street the enemy can look
[1:29:26] at me and say here comes another one
[1:29:27] yeah
[1:29:29] and now he wants to attack me
[1:29:31] yeah i can't come to brother and porn
[1:29:34] just take his car keys and disappear
[1:29:37] and come back
[1:29:38] in the months time before i go to south
[1:29:40] africa
[1:29:41] i say yes your car brother
[1:29:43] he will say to me how did you manage to
[1:29:45] take it you never asked me
[1:29:47] now i had to suffer without my car you
[1:29:49] know we had to go on the train and the
[1:29:50] bus and this and that luckily the buses
[1:29:53] are working here but it's still an
[1:29:54] inconvenience
[1:29:56] where we come from the buses are always
[1:29:58] on time is that right brother-in-law not
[1:30:02] anyway
[1:30:03] so
[1:30:04] i need permission because the car does
[1:30:06] not belong to me
[1:30:08] it belongs to brother and paul
[1:30:10] and if you don't belong to the devil but
[1:30:12] you belong to jesus christ who has he
[1:30:14] asked permission to come and attack you
[1:30:17] he has to ask the lord the owner
[1:30:20] and the owner looks at every petition
[1:30:22] and he grants certain certain certain
[1:30:24] acknowledgement he grants it and
[1:30:26] permissions but they're all restricted
[1:30:29] because i don't belong to myself i
[1:30:31] belong to him and he is the owner and
[1:30:32] nobody can touch me until the owner says
[1:30:35] yes
[1:30:37] it brings peace
[1:30:38] i'm at peace whatever happens to me
[1:30:40] there's a great god that has allowed it
[1:30:42] and he says i will never test you about
[1:30:44] what you can endure i will never
[1:30:47] destroy you but i'll make you peaceful
[1:30:50] ephesians says christ preached peace
[1:30:52] upon us
[1:30:53] he came and he preached peace to you
[1:30:55] which were afar of unto them which were
[1:30:57] nigh
[1:30:58] so he died for peace on the cross his
[1:31:00] word being preached is another form of
[1:31:02] peace
[1:31:04] another one he says he gives peace in
[1:31:06] john 14 peace i leave with you my peace
[1:31:09] i give unto you not as the world giveth
[1:31:12] i give unto you
[1:31:14] so he clearly stated don't look for
[1:31:16] worldly peace
[1:31:17] don't look for a perfect world yet there
[1:31:19] is no perfect world here look for the
[1:31:22] perfect word in your life and that will
[1:31:24] bring perfection that will bring peace
[1:31:26] to know you know what this world is full
[1:31:28] of trouble
[1:31:36] a peace above worldly peace
[1:31:38] a peace that i can become
[1:31:41] and know that my god is in control even
[1:31:44] in the face of death
[1:31:46] amen and then he says in ephesians for
[1:31:49] christ is our peace
[1:31:51] when you have christ you have peace
[1:31:53] because he is the author of peace
[1:31:56] amen jeremiah 6 14
[1:31:59] because the world says and the bible
[1:32:01] warns us
[1:32:03] when they say peace be sudden
[1:32:04] destruction will be upon them
[1:32:06] jeremiah 6 14 they have healed also the
[1:32:09] hurt of the daughter of my people
[1:32:11] slightly
[1:32:12] have you ever heard that
[1:32:14] they have heard they have healed
[1:32:17] the hurt of the daughter of my people
[1:32:19] slightly
[1:32:22] and saying to them because the hurt of
[1:32:24] the slight healing comes from saying
[1:32:26] peace peace when there is no peace
[1:32:29] i don't want a man to tell me this peace
[1:32:31] yeah
[1:32:32] i don't want to tell a man to tell me
[1:32:34] i'm on my way to heaven when i'm not
[1:32:35] right i don't want a man to appease me i
[1:32:38] want the word to be straight with me to
[1:32:40] tell me repent or perish to tell me
[1:32:43] exactly what he expects of me because
[1:32:45] that brings peace
[1:32:47] so god rebukes them here to say you have
[1:32:49] tried to heal the people slightly right
[1:32:52] because if you come to me with a problem
[1:32:54] and i'll tell you and i give you some
[1:32:55] soft story
[1:32:57] which is not true
[1:32:58] it will bring slight relief
[1:33:01] it will bring a little bit of relief
[1:33:02] that you will go away and feel a little
[1:33:04] bit better but guess what tomorrow the
[1:33:05] problem is still there
[1:33:07] god is not like that when god comes and
[1:33:09] he heals you he takes the problem away
[1:33:12] he relieves it he heals you he delivers
[1:33:14] you of every demon i don't care what
[1:33:16] attraction or addiction or whatever
[1:33:18] comes your way god can deliver you of
[1:33:20] all of them completely
[1:33:23] that's right not halfway completely
[1:33:26] but this peace that jeremiah speaks of
[1:33:28] it is a piece of ignorance
[1:33:31] ignorance
[1:33:32] many times message people they become
[1:33:34] ignorant of the reality of life of the
[1:33:38] reality of the word of god of all these
[1:33:40] things and they want this this is this
[1:33:42] artificial peace
[1:33:45] don't look for peace in that sense look
[1:33:47] for the word of god in manifestation in
[1:33:49] my life because the greater the word
[1:33:52] manifest the greater the enemy will
[1:33:53] attack you the more problems you will
[1:33:55] have right
[1:33:57] it's true
[1:33:59] every time i make a testimony at
[1:34:00] churches the elder tells me afterwards
[1:34:02] oh why did you do that
[1:34:06] because from monday there's trouble
[1:34:08] we fight we argue we struck not against
[1:34:10] each other but against the enemy
[1:34:12] then you know he's behind you because
[1:34:13] you made a public testimony that i am
[1:34:16] full of peace i've got the peace of the
[1:34:19] lord
[1:34:20] and then monday morning the devil is
[1:34:21] there to take that peace out of you
[1:34:24] amen so it's an important principle but
[1:34:26] that gives you character it gives you
[1:34:28] the ability to show i am more than able
[1:34:30] through jesus christ my lord to face
[1:34:32] every trial every test
[1:34:35] so there's a piece of ignorance
[1:34:37] amen
[1:34:39] that you just ignore the facts
[1:34:41] and think everything is fine
[1:34:43] don't be in that
[1:34:44] peace there's a piece of stagnation
[1:34:48] where the waters are so calm yeah man
[1:34:51] it's so wonderful
[1:34:53] it is so
[1:34:54] blessed
[1:34:55] but that calm waters what does it create
[1:34:58] stagnation brings all kinds of
[1:35:01] evil things
[1:35:02] lizards snakes
[1:35:04] everything that you don't want because
[1:35:06] there's a stagnation yeah that's why the
[1:35:08] waters of the world needs to move upon
[1:35:10] the water so that it can shake it up
[1:35:12] that it can throw all the dross on the
[1:35:14] side and that's the principle that god
[1:35:16] uses
[1:35:17] but we think man god has blessed me i'm
[1:35:19] it's so peaceful around me
[1:35:21] no it's not a p it's not a sign that
[1:35:23] everything is fine yeah it's a sign that
[1:35:25] you're in trouble
[1:35:27] a sign that you must start to pray say
[1:35:28] lord just shake me up a bit amen but we
[1:35:31] don't want to pray like that because we
[1:35:32] don't have the mind of god
[1:35:34] because the bible says jesus learned
[1:35:35] obedience by what
[1:35:38] oh i thought the things that didn't
[1:35:40] happen to you so if jesus had to learn
[1:35:43] obedience what about you
[1:35:44] him being the full manifested son of god
[1:35:48] he learned obedience by the things he
[1:35:50] suffered and i guess what you can add
[1:35:52] your name to that to say lord my name is
[1:35:54] included in there i have learned
[1:35:56] obedience with every tribe
[1:35:58] every suffering every shake-up of the
[1:36:00] tree i've learned to be obedient
[1:36:03] that's how god works
[1:36:05] i don't care where we live what we do
[1:36:07] that is the same principle
[1:36:09] god knows how to shake us
[1:36:11] how to move with us
[1:36:13] then there's a peace an imperfect piece
[1:36:15] of dependence
[1:36:17] amen
[1:36:18] we depend on a person
[1:36:21] it's an imperfect peace
[1:36:23] because if you depend on a person that
[1:36:25] person is going to die if the lord
[1:36:26] doesn't come that's right then your
[1:36:28] peace has also died with that person
[1:36:31] my peace is in jesus christ who rose
[1:36:34] from the dead who can never die again i
[1:36:36] don't care what happens what satan
[1:36:37] brings he is the king of king the author
[1:36:39] of life so my peace is an eternal peace
[1:36:43] amen
[1:36:44] it's perfect that's right in the in the
[1:36:47] midst of the storm it is perfect
[1:36:50] now we all know the story about the
[1:36:52] prophet and the bull
[1:36:53] yeah it's one of those famous
[1:36:56] message
[1:36:57] things that happened to the prophet for
[1:36:58] us to teach us a lesson every day and
[1:37:00] you can look at it from different angles
[1:37:02] and different ways but you can just do
[1:37:04] other lord engineers in life yeah the
[1:37:06] lord has engineered your life yes
[1:37:09] he allows things and he does
[1:37:11] things that to to bring us to a position
[1:37:14] so he goes and he's going to pray for
[1:37:16] the sick sister
[1:37:17] and as he comes he parks his his little
[1:37:19] bucky or you to what you call it and he
[1:37:21] gets out he leaves his gun yeah we call
[1:37:24] it the bucky i know when i said the
[1:37:25] bucky nobody knew what i was talking
[1:37:27] about so they corrected me a few weeks
[1:37:29] back
[1:37:30] so here's the the he puts his gun on the
[1:37:33] seat
[1:37:34] jumps over the fence
[1:37:36] and here he goes
[1:37:39] and now he comes to the middle of the of
[1:37:40] the of the camp
[1:37:42] and all of a sudden he sees a big animal
[1:37:44] laying there
[1:37:45] a bull
[1:37:46] and he realized mice the killer bull
[1:37:48] that killed somebody last week
[1:37:50] so now you can see god has taken away
[1:37:52] the gun
[1:37:54] now all of a sudden the bull also sees
[1:37:56] the prophet
[1:37:57] now the bull ma maybe on his mind he
[1:37:59] still had that fresh impression of what
[1:38:00] he did last week and he's so anointed of
[1:38:03] the devil and so on and he jumps up
[1:38:06] now what does the prophet do he does
[1:38:07] what every one of us does go to our own
[1:38:10] human ability yeah that's right he never
[1:38:12] fell on his knees raise his hand and say
[1:38:13] oh lord jesus be merciful to me
[1:38:16] first thing he goes for the gun
[1:38:19] because if he had his gun he would have
[1:38:20] shot the bull yeah
[1:38:21] and he would have paid back the owner
[1:38:23] your life is more than the bull
[1:38:26] so he realized the gun is not there then
[1:38:28] the next thing he says i was looking for
[1:38:29] a tree
[1:38:31] and god made it that in that camp
[1:38:33] there's no tree
[1:38:34] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:37] because there's no con incident
[1:38:40] it is not just a haphazard happening it
[1:38:42] is god's mind engineering the
[1:38:44] circumstances to bring to me and you the
[1:38:47] reality of the god that we serve
[1:38:50] now he looks for a tree
[1:38:51] and he says there's no tree and then the
[1:38:53] next thing he looks for the fence he
[1:38:54] says the fence is too far i don't god
[1:38:56] didn't make him a hundred meter sprinter
[1:38:59] because he could not outrun the bull
[1:39:01] yeah
[1:39:02] and he says no i'm in trouble
[1:39:04] and the bull gets up and the bull gets
[1:39:06] excited and he says the bull drops his
[1:39:08] head and here he comes
[1:39:10] now look at what he says and here he
[1:39:11] comes
[1:39:12] well he's got perhaps within 20 yards no
[1:39:15] need of trying to run you couldn't run
[1:39:17] anywhere no push three to get into you
[1:39:20] just have to stand and face it
[1:39:22] that's all so he just decided now i'm
[1:39:24] gonna face it and something happened
[1:39:28] instead of hating the bull or wanting to
[1:39:30] kill it a perfect piece settles him
[1:39:34] can you see how powerful that piece is
[1:39:37] if i don't say an angel appeared
[1:39:39] to stand between me and the bull
[1:39:42] no he said perfect peace
[1:39:44] came and settled where
[1:39:47] yeah amen perfect peace in the face of
[1:39:50] uncoming certain death
[1:39:53] not perhaps not maybe the man the bull
[1:39:55] at the track record he's a killer
[1:39:58] so the bull coming he says a perfect
[1:40:00] piece settled down and i thought
[1:40:03] look how he changed his thoughts
[1:40:05] as we saw now earlier the perfect piece
[1:40:07] is linked to the mind of god
[1:40:09] so yeah perfect peace settled and
[1:40:11] immediately his thoughts changed
[1:40:13] from before country just that now he
[1:40:16] says and i thought i disturbed the poor
[1:40:19] fellow
[1:40:20] and the bull is still coming yeah
[1:40:22] now he's not worried about the bull
[1:40:24] coming
[1:40:25] his thoughts has now changed
[1:40:27] and he says my i destruct the poor
[1:40:29] fellow
[1:40:30] and when he got coming to me real close
[1:40:31] i said now i'm sorry i disturbed you
[1:40:35] he's apologizing to the book
[1:40:37] perfect peace
[1:40:39] i am the servant of the lord and i
[1:40:40] charge thee in the name of the lord
[1:40:41] jesus christ our creator that you go
[1:40:43] over there and lay down
[1:40:45] and here comes the bull coming right on
[1:40:47] but samuel i wasn't a bit afraid
[1:40:51] then i'm right here before lovely
[1:40:52] christians he got within about 10 feet
[1:40:55] of where i was standing and i just stood
[1:40:56] there looking at him not a more afraid
[1:40:58] than i am of this meek looking little
[1:41:00] lady sitting here looking at me
[1:41:02] and he ran right to me
[1:41:04] when he got right up close to me
[1:41:08] he just throwed out
[1:41:10] he just throwed out his feet and stopped
[1:41:14] and he looked this way
[1:41:15] and he looked this way
[1:41:17] can you imagine
[1:41:20] and he looked away
[1:41:21] so depleted
[1:41:23] and he turned around
[1:41:25] walked over and go and lay down under
[1:41:27] that little bush
[1:41:29] he says what happened
[1:41:31] what did that bull experience if you
[1:41:33] think about it yeah because both of them
[1:41:35] had no experiences
[1:41:36] the prophet had an experience and the
[1:41:38] bulleted experience
[1:41:40] because the prophet says everything that
[1:41:42] comes close into the presence of god has
[1:41:44] got an experience
[1:41:45] even when the devil came to kill jesus
[1:41:47] on the cross he had an experience
[1:41:50] yes he did he says nothing can be the
[1:41:53] same when they come into the presence of
[1:41:55] god you're either closer to god or
[1:41:57] you're further away from god the
[1:41:58] maturity of the seed in your heart
[1:42:01] if you are a true seed you are closer to
[1:42:02] god if not you are farther away
[1:42:05] because the word matures amen
[1:42:07] so he says
[1:42:09] the bull must have experienced
[1:42:11] an adopted son
[1:42:14] there was an atmosphere
[1:42:16] the bull must have experienced
[1:42:19] adam again
[1:42:20] because remember the creation is
[1:42:22] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:42:23] son of god and all of a sudden the bull
[1:42:25] comes into an atmosphere and in his mind
[1:42:28] he must have gone back and said here's
[1:42:29] adam
[1:42:30] my creator my ruler my king
[1:42:33] and he can never touch his end creator
[1:42:37] and the prophet must have experienced
[1:42:39] perfect peace
[1:42:40] to apologize to the bull
[1:42:42] he spoke like adam spoke to them yes
[1:42:44] amen
[1:42:45] so that bull must have heard that same
[1:42:47] voice
[1:42:48] that said to him peace
[1:42:51] tree move here wind stop
[1:42:53] it's the creator
[1:42:55] that adam condition that god is bringing
[1:42:57] us because he says you are an atmosphere
[1:42:59] creator
[1:43:00] and that's why it's so important to have
[1:43:02] that mind of god but if you don't have
[1:43:03] that you can never do these things you
[1:43:05] can never come to that full maturity
[1:43:07] that's why it's so important to have
[1:43:08] that mind of god the baptism of the holy
[1:43:10] spirit the revelation and the growth in
[1:43:12] jesus christ
[1:43:14] amen
[1:43:15] so that obedience was upon him
[1:43:19] because he comes to that principle to
[1:43:21] say you know what
[1:43:22] the mind of god brings you to an
[1:43:24] obedience
[1:43:25] brings you to a point where you realize
[1:43:27] god is god
[1:43:29] the prophet is when you come to total
[1:43:31] obedience then you can have possession
[1:43:33] but until you totally obey you've got to
[1:43:36] completely surrender your own thoughts
[1:43:39] your own world your own mind and let the
[1:43:41] mind of christ operate in you
[1:43:43] the bible you cannot say the bible is
[1:43:45] right in some places and not in others
[1:43:47] the mind of christ would sanction every
[1:43:49] word of christ and say amen
[1:43:52] every word of christ that's right
[1:43:54] not some
[1:43:55] those that you like you can get excited
[1:43:57] thank you jesus
[1:43:58] those that you don't like
[1:44:01] every word is an amen
[1:44:04] not some not the ones i like if i don't
[1:44:06] like it i can still say amen
[1:44:07] as long as it's written in the bible i
[1:44:09] say amen to every word doesn't matter if
[1:44:12] it hurts me it doesn't matter if it
[1:44:14] blesses me i say amen that's the mind of
[1:44:17] god hallelujah now here comes a woman
[1:44:20] she's got a sick child
[1:44:22] jesus is busy with an important meeting
[1:44:24] with the disciples
[1:44:26] she comes from the site and she says oh
[1:44:27] son of david master as she approaches
[1:44:30] him
[1:44:30] but she calls him
[1:44:33] constantly
[1:44:34] peter says lord sander a wage is
[1:44:36] disturbing us
[1:44:38] because peter already said no the lord
[1:44:39] is ignoring her so he felt he can also
[1:44:42] ignore her
[1:44:43] so all right he says lord send that away
[1:44:46] now they imagine though they talking
[1:44:48] about her she's present
[1:44:51] they're talking about you how do you
[1:44:52] like people talking about you yeah
[1:44:55] i don't like it
[1:44:56] you hear from the grapevine you know
[1:44:58] that one said this about you
[1:45:00] and it hurts you
[1:45:01] you think my how can they say that about
[1:45:03] me now imagine people talking about you
[1:45:05] and you're standing next to them wow
[1:45:07] yeah and that's that's
[1:45:09] that's strong
[1:45:11] now she hears him say
[1:45:13] yeah peter you're right you know what uh
[1:45:15] i'm not sent
[1:45:17] to the dogs
[1:45:19] i cannot give her the bread of the
[1:45:20] children
[1:45:22] i cannot do these things now
[1:45:24] he's calling her names yeah
[1:45:26] he's calling her first he ignores her
[1:45:28] then he calls her names and so you can
[1:45:30] start to see the magnitude of that test
[1:45:32] now rising up
[1:45:34] but she had a deep desire in her and she
[1:45:37] made a decision that whatever he says is
[1:45:39] right
[1:45:40] right i don't care what he says i need
[1:45:43] something from him and for me to receive
[1:45:45] i has to deny myself and say amen to
[1:45:48] every word
[1:45:49] and when he says she's a dog what does
[1:45:51] she say
[1:45:54] amen
[1:45:55] which means it's true
[1:45:57] which means it's true lord she knew he
[1:45:59] cannot lie if he calls me a dog then i
[1:46:01] say amen
[1:46:02] she says amen i'm a dog but lord the
[1:46:04] dogs can eat the crumbs that fall from
[1:46:06] the table he turns to and says my
[1:46:09] daughter is he'll come
[1:46:11] without a prayer
[1:46:13] without anything
[1:46:15] she pulled right from heaven right
[1:46:16] through him
[1:46:17] what he needed because she was willing
[1:46:19] to say amen to every word we must be
[1:46:22] willing to say amen to every word every
[1:46:24] quote everything that god delivers don't
[1:46:27] try and reason it don't even try to
[1:46:29] understand it amen because there's many
[1:46:31] things you will never understand
[1:46:34] according to the prophet
[1:46:36] revelation
[1:46:37] is the important part
[1:46:39] by faith because remember if you
[1:46:40] understand everything you don't need
[1:46:42] faith that's right
[1:46:43] it's true if you know the message from a
[1:46:46] to z
[1:46:47] you don't need
[1:46:48] faith
[1:46:50] but he says there's certain things that
[1:46:51] you need to believe by faith
[1:46:53] how is it going to happen i don't know
[1:46:54] but i believe it when is it going to
[1:46:56] happen i don't know but i believe it's
[1:46:58] going to happen all those things like
[1:47:00] the date for the rapture is by faith
[1:47:03] if it comes tomorrow we'll be ready
[1:47:06] is that true that's fine
[1:47:09] let's say the lord's coming tomorrow 12
[1:47:10] o'clock
[1:47:12] who's going to pack his van tomorrow to
[1:47:13] go to work
[1:47:15] [Laughter]
[1:47:18] amen
[1:47:20] no we will say lani just make me a nice
[1:47:22] breakfast i'm not going to work today
[1:47:25] you know the lord's coming at 12 i'm
[1:47:26] gonna not waste my time on the job
[1:47:29] but the prophet says if you know the
[1:47:30] lord's coming you go that morning you
[1:47:32] plant your potatoes as if you're gonna
[1:47:33] harvest
[1:47:35] that's the christian attitude that's the
[1:47:36] way we live is not based upon time your
[1:47:39] life has been changed completely and
[1:47:41] therefore it's a life style that comes
[1:47:44] now
[1:47:45] it's not based upon anything else
[1:47:47] so that woman called the dog she
[1:47:49] understood and she said amen and the
[1:47:51] amen produced the result
[1:47:53] amen so we have it brings also the mind
[1:47:56] of obedience
[1:47:58] when you have the mind of christ
[1:47:59] it brings the mind of obedience to say
[1:48:01] amen to every word
[1:48:03] because what god was he brought into
[1:48:05] christ and what christ was he brought
[1:48:07] into the church
[1:48:08] is that right
[1:48:09] he's brass produced that
[1:48:12] now
[1:48:13] he says in plain language the true bride
[1:48:16] of christ was in the mind of god
[1:48:18] eternally
[1:48:20] through though not expressed until each
[1:48:23] came forth in the designated decreed
[1:48:25] season
[1:48:26] as each member came forth it became
[1:48:28] expressed
[1:48:30] and took its place in the body
[1:48:32] that's the bright is the literal spoken
[1:48:35] word seed bride that's right so you are
[1:48:37] the literal spoken word seed bright
[1:48:40] that's right that way in the mind of god
[1:48:42] that was spoken into creation and in the
[1:48:45] right time and season god found you
[1:48:48] amen in this very time that you live in
[1:48:51] so she was predestinated amen he says we
[1:48:54] did not become seed by rebirth
[1:48:58] we were seated and therefore were reborn
[1:49:00] for only elect can be reborn
[1:49:02] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:49:05] could be quickened non-seed there is
[1:49:07] nothing to be quickened
[1:49:09] if there were no seed inside of you you
[1:49:11] would cannot be quickened so the fact
[1:49:14] that you can see and understand by
[1:49:15] revelation the word of god is the
[1:49:17] greatest blessing that you will ever
[1:49:19] have
[1:49:20] that's why the prophet says there's only
[1:49:21] one way you know god loves you
[1:49:24] he gave me a nice job he gave me a big
[1:49:26] business he gave me a big car he gave me
[1:49:28] the no
[1:49:29] only reason you can know he loves you is
[1:49:30] by election yeah the fact that he
[1:49:32] elected you is proof that he loves you
[1:49:35] whatever happens after that is by god's
[1:49:37] grace
[1:49:38] whatever he seems fit for me is by his
[1:49:40] grace amen
[1:49:43] because it's a principle that we have to
[1:49:44] understand
[1:49:46] amen amen
[1:49:48] now he says when they were traveling in
[1:49:50] the old testament
[1:49:52] all of a sudden they did things wrong
[1:49:55] serpents came and started to bite them
[1:49:58] some died burnt like fire the bible says
[1:50:00] they were under pressure
[1:50:02] now they cried to god and god makes a
[1:50:04] way for them
[1:50:05] he says and god says to moses make a
[1:50:07] paul put a snake upon it and if they
[1:50:09] look upon that they live
[1:50:11] so he presents something to them
[1:50:14] now the prophet says the paul
[1:50:15] represented the cross
[1:50:17] everything represented christ
[1:50:19] why did he foreshadow that god in the
[1:50:22] beginning he was only letting the
[1:50:24] children of israel draw interest and
[1:50:26] what he was going to do
[1:50:29] so here he comes with a beautiful
[1:50:30] principle that in the mind of god jesus
[1:50:32] was crucified before the foundation of
[1:50:34] the world
[1:50:35] did it happen
[1:50:37] exactly because god's minds are eternal
[1:50:39] his thoughts are eternal so here he
[1:50:41] comes and they're in trouble and he
[1:50:42] produces something that must happen two
[1:50:45] thousand years later
[1:50:47] produce a stick with a snake and they
[1:50:49] starting to draw interest on something
[1:50:51] that must happen later
[1:50:53] i want you to follow that
[1:50:55] in the mind of god christ was already
[1:50:57] crucified
[1:50:59] for he was the lamb slain from the
[1:51:00] foundation of the world back in eden
[1:51:03] christ in god's thoughts which became
[1:51:05] his word had not materialized yet but he
[1:51:08] knew it was what he had promised it and
[1:51:10] he let the children of israel draw
[1:51:12] interest before the deposit was made
[1:51:15] amen amen amen
[1:51:17] draw interest i've never seen that
[1:51:20] before every bank wants you to deposit
[1:51:22] money
[1:51:23] yeah and then you can draw interest
[1:51:25] right but the bank of god doesn't work
[1:51:27] like that
[1:51:28] he says you can draw interest on a
[1:51:30] deposit that has not been made yet
[1:51:33] when they were there jesus christ was
[1:51:34] gonna die and they got the healing
[1:51:36] before he even died what about you and
[1:51:39] me after the deposit has been made how
[1:51:41] much more can you come to that bank and
[1:51:43] say lord i need something today
[1:51:46] the deposit has been made everything is
[1:51:48] placed there you can take it if you want
[1:51:51] it
[1:51:52] it's a principle
[1:51:54] if they can draw interest before the
[1:51:55] deposit my
[1:51:57] the prophet says how is it possible
[1:52:00] that you cannot draw interest if the
[1:52:02] deposit is already made
[1:52:05] they could come and say the deposit is
[1:52:07] not there but i'm drawing
[1:52:09] on the future prospects
[1:52:11] you don't have to come like that you can
[1:52:13] come and say lord it is done it is
[1:52:15] finished the word declares it i'm coming
[1:52:18] to a deposited bank every promise is
[1:52:20] there everything i need is that i'm
[1:52:22] drawing
[1:52:23] i believe amen
[1:52:26] for my protection for my provision for
[1:52:28] my healing amen amen
[1:52:31] because i'm coming there
[1:52:33] it must be a principle
[1:52:35] now listen to what he says here
[1:52:38] and then he handed it down his knowledge
[1:52:40] to the prophets and they wrote it out
[1:52:42] and year by year and century of the
[1:52:43] century we see it coming to pass exactly
[1:52:46] god giving us a shadow of the old force
[1:52:49] foreshadowing the new and we see it word
[1:52:51] by word being fulfilled what a faith we
[1:52:53] ought to have established in god
[1:52:56] he says you as a believer here
[1:52:58] your faith
[1:53:00] ought to be established this morning
[1:53:02] because you've got no excuse you have
[1:53:04] seen
[1:53:05] what god has done in your day you have
[1:53:07] even seen from the very first from adam
[1:53:09] right till today what god has done
[1:53:12] he says that's there for you to be
[1:53:14] established
[1:53:15] to know what god is capable of to
[1:53:18] understand and believe it by faith and
[1:53:19] to say lord i believe it amen it's done
[1:53:23] yes i'm coming to draw interest
[1:53:27] on what has been done for me
[1:53:30] i'm a son of god
[1:53:32] i have dominion
[1:53:34] this earth has been given to us
[1:53:36] he says like adam was a controller a god
[1:53:39] to this earth so you'll be
[1:53:41] a ruler a judge
[1:53:43] but my faith needs to be established
[1:53:45] amen because how are you going to rule
[1:53:47] if your faith is not established
[1:53:49] how are you going to judge if your faith
[1:53:51] is not established
[1:53:52] because remember he says you're gonna
[1:53:54] judge with him yes right
[1:53:56] now it's easy to say man that's a
[1:53:58] wonderful thought but just think about
[1:53:59] it let's say it's now the great white
[1:54:01] throne judgment
[1:54:03] and you're standing on that side of the
[1:54:05] judge next to him yeah and now if
[1:54:07] somebody comes up and the lord turns you
[1:54:09] and say you judge the case wow
[1:54:12] think about it wow
[1:54:14] the reality of it
[1:54:16] the consequences of it
[1:54:19] that you're gonna tell this person
[1:54:20] heaven or hell
[1:54:23] then it becomes a fearful thing
[1:54:25] then it becomes the reality is now
[1:54:27] weighing up on your hands to say man
[1:54:29] what i'm doing now is going to be life
[1:54:30] or death
[1:54:32] then it's no more quotes flying around
[1:54:33] and one brother cutting the other
[1:54:35] brother and one church against the other
[1:54:36] church then it's life or death
[1:54:39] and you must know where you're standing
[1:54:40] you must have the mind of god and you
[1:54:42] must act like it was god himself
[1:54:44] standing there judging rightfully
[1:54:47] so where do we start with that we start
[1:54:49] here not in the millennium not at the
[1:54:51] end he says here you start to live godly
[1:54:54] here you start to exercise your faith
[1:54:55] here you start to be a son of god not
[1:54:57] waiting for the heavens
[1:55:00] heaven we're gonna be but you'll have no
[1:55:02] trial or no test in heaven that's why he
[1:55:04] says here the life is where you live
[1:55:07] years where you gain your experiences
[1:55:09] you will gain new experiences in heaven
[1:55:12] because you'll be complete your
[1:55:13] character you'll take with you
[1:55:15] he says your character is not formed in
[1:55:17] heaven
[1:55:18] it's formed here
[1:55:19] that's why every test every trial you
[1:55:22] should you should look at it like god
[1:55:24] it's not a burden it's not a it's not a
[1:55:26] shame it's not something that god is
[1:55:28] punishing you it is gold to me
[1:55:31] as a son of god it's gold to me
[1:55:34] he could have left me
[1:55:36] and i would have no testimony
[1:55:38] but now we can call up anybody and
[1:55:40] they'll have something to say
[1:55:42] you know i was in trouble god did this
[1:55:43] for me i was down deep in the mud god
[1:55:46] pulled me out i was lost but he saved me
[1:55:48] i was weak but he made me strong i was
[1:55:51] lost but he found me and this testimony
[1:55:53] upon testimony
[1:55:55] that's why when you come into heaven the
[1:55:57] angels will like to know what happened
[1:55:59] how did this come and everyone will have
[1:56:01] a test the angels has got no testimony
[1:56:03] like you
[1:56:05] that's why you are a son and daughter of
[1:56:07] god amen says heavens will sing when you
[1:56:09] enter
[1:56:11] because there's an expression
[1:56:13] there's a life
[1:56:15] and we can draw interest
[1:56:17] from what god has done
[1:56:19] but how what's the problem we don't have
[1:56:20] the mind of god
[1:56:22] so here's the bank

[1:58:23] certainty that the deposit is made my
[1:58:25] interest is guaranteed nothing can take
[1:58:27] it from me
[1:58:29] you don't worry if it's there or not you

[1:58:32] by faith you know my god cannot lie so
[1:58:35] when you come to the lady she might have
[1:58:36] a bad day yeah
[1:58:38] she might treat your root it's got
[1:58:40] nothing to do with it

[1:58:44] blessing her rootness is not gonna
[1:58:45] diminish my blessing i can just come and
[1:58:48] say i need my hundred dollars and make
[1:58:50] it quickly
[1:58:51] [Laughter]
[1:58:53] and she can't argue she can't reason she
[1:58:56] might feel bad she might feel sad she
[1:58:58] has to deliver that promise and it's the
[1:59:00] same with us when you come to god
[1:59:02] come with the certainty to know the
[1:59:04] deposit is made
[1:59:06] the interest is there for me
[1:59:08] when i need it i can walk in there and i
[1:59:10] can just collect it because god has done
[1:59:13] it if they can do it on a pre-deposit
[1:59:16] i can do it after a deposit
[1:59:19] it's certain because it's an unchanging
[1:59:21] god
[1:59:22] but your faith needs to be established
[1:59:25] amen
[1:59:26] he says the prophet says what a faith we
[1:59:28] ought to have established in god amen
[1:59:30] now the word established means having
[1:59:32] existed or done something for a long
[1:59:35] time
[1:59:36] how many times have you seen god move
[1:59:39] how many testimonies have you heard how
[1:59:40] many in your own life how many things
[1:59:42] has god done for you small things big
[1:59:44] things little things whatever it is
[1:59:47] there repeated time after time for you
[1:59:50] to have a faith established
[1:59:53] amen that you can stand with that
[1:59:55] boldness to say i know my god and i know
[1:59:57] him in the power of his resurrection and
[1:59:59] i know him in the strength of the
[2:00:01] ability that he can do
[2:00:03] it's an unfailing word
[2:00:05] hebrews 4 2.
[2:00:08] do we still have time
[2:00:15] you must tell me when my time is up
[2:00:20] thank you
[2:00:21] he wasn't sure if he must not or not not
[2:00:23] but he favored me
[2:00:26] when i look at you you just go like this
[2:00:27] and i know it's finished
[2:00:29] thank you
[2:00:31] it's still going okay so
[2:00:33] hebrews 4 verse 2
[2:00:36] for unto us was the gospel preached
[2:00:39] amen
[2:00:40] as well as unto them
[2:00:43] but the word preached did not profit
[2:00:45] them
[2:00:46] not being mixed with faith in them that
[2:00:48] hurt it
[2:00:50] so you can sit under the true anointed
[2:00:52] word and it cannot profit you if your
[2:00:55] faith doesn't mix with that word
[2:00:58] not your own faith but god's faith
[2:01:00] inside of you
[2:01:01] to be mixed to be able to believe it to
[2:01:03] say lord i believe every word that's
[2:01:04] been preached
[2:01:06] so that word being preached did not
[2:01:08] profit them
[2:01:10] because it was not mixed with faith in
[2:01:12] them that hurt it
[2:01:14] now the prophet says my brethren let me
[2:01:16] stop here for a minute
[2:01:18] no matter how much the word is preached
[2:01:20] how well you like the way it's been
[2:01:21] preached unless you yourself are a
[2:01:24] partaker of that it won't do you any
[2:01:26] good
[2:01:28] not being mixed were faith by them that
[2:01:29] hurt it
[2:01:31] they've seen the miracles of moses
[2:01:33] they said that's pretty good and they
[2:01:36] walked over
[2:01:37] they seen him perform miracles
[2:01:39] they seen the pillar of fire maybe or
[2:01:41] heard them talk about it oh that's all
[2:01:43] right but it wasn't mixed with personal
[2:01:45] faith
[2:01:46] for as soon as they got in the
[2:01:47] wilderness they began to murmur
[2:01:50] and god says because they adopted it was
[2:01:53] sin
[2:01:54] don't doubt nothing believe
[2:01:56] don't help no matter how hard the case
[2:01:57] is believe it
[2:01:59] because the word preached can only
[2:02:00] profit you if you believe it if you
[2:02:02] don't believe it it cannot profit you
[2:02:05] now he says god showed them the purify
[2:02:07] he showed them signs and wonders he let
[2:02:09] them out he brought them into temptation
[2:02:11] to try and prove them
[2:02:14] amen
[2:02:15] so something will happen and then god
[2:02:16] will to prove you
[2:02:19] it happens like that let's think about
[2:02:21] job
[2:02:23] here's job a man of god a servant of god
[2:02:26] a prophet of god when his children have
[2:02:28] a party he goes and sacrifice in case
[2:02:30] they sin he was a believer of the blood
[2:02:32] sacrifice and he was real sincere
[2:02:36] and now
[2:02:37] there's a meeting in heaven and
[2:02:40] satan is found among the sons of god and
[2:02:43] god approaches him and says have you
[2:02:45] considered
[2:02:47] my servant job
[2:02:49] why does god do that because he wanted
[2:02:51] to give job a deeper understanding
[2:02:54] a deeper revelation
[2:02:56] and satan says yeah now i've looked at
[2:02:58] him but you have hedged him up
[2:03:01] what is a hedge
[2:03:03] god has put a fence around you
[2:03:06] no demon can come to you no devil no
[2:03:08] nothing because god says this is the
[2:03:09] fence i've built myself
[2:03:11] and satan saw the fence and satan knew i
[2:03:13] cannot touch him
[2:03:15] and god says fine i'll remove a part of
[2:03:17] the hedge
[2:03:18] a small part i'll remove you can do this
[2:03:20] do this but you cannot take his life god
[2:03:22] always puts the conditions down
[2:03:24] not just giving satan an open book
[2:03:27] amen
[2:03:28] he doesn't have any troubles he doesn't
[2:03:29] have any worries
[2:03:31] and god allowed it and opened it up
[2:03:34] the prophet says he doesn't have any
[2:03:36] worries he doesn't have any financial
[2:03:39] burdens
[2:03:40] everything is fine he doesn't have
[2:03:42] sickness
[2:03:43] any pain
[2:03:44] let me have him and i'll make him curse
[2:03:46] you to your face
[2:03:48] and god opened the hedge
[2:03:50] because god knew job will never curse
[2:03:52] him
[2:03:53] but it was for job's benefit it was not
[2:03:56] for any other one's benefit it was not
[2:03:58] for satan's to enjoy himself it was for
[2:04:01] god's benefit job's benefit
[2:04:04] amen
[2:04:05] even accusing him of a certain of a
[2:04:07] secret sinner
[2:04:09] amen and all the things that happened to
[2:04:11] him
[2:04:12] but at the end job came out stronger
[2:04:15] when the trial was finished
[2:04:17] job could rise from the airship and he
[2:04:19] was a stronger man than when he entered
[2:04:21] him
[2:04:22] every trial every test you enter when
[2:04:24] you come out on the other side you are
[2:04:26] stronger
[2:04:27] remember when you came into their word
[2:04:31] man i can remember maybe you are not
[2:04:32] like me
[2:04:34] but my when when something happens to me
[2:04:36] it upsets me me and my wife will go on
[2:04:39] we'll cry together
[2:04:40] how is this possible how can this happen
[2:04:42] to us a small thing
[2:04:45] and as you grow
[2:04:47] after that trial another trial comes
[2:04:49] and you don't realize but you become
[2:04:50] stronger now today if something like
[2:04:53] that happens to me it won't even touch
[2:04:54] me
[2:04:56] because it's such a small test i don't
[2:04:57] even see it sometimes because you have
[2:04:59] grown mature you've gone stronger and
[2:05:02] it's time goes so your tests increase
[2:05:05] as a baby comes in there's certain
[2:05:07] things aloud
[2:05:08] when he starts to walk he will fall
[2:05:10] but as he gets stronger and stronger god
[2:05:12] will allow more things and we must
[2:05:14] realize god is working in every life
[2:05:17] every one of us has got a trial a test
[2:05:19] something that we work with and god is
[2:05:21] working with us and bringing us to a
[2:05:23] stronger point
[2:05:24] so your test and trials is not there to
[2:05:26] destroy you
[2:05:27] it's not there to take faith from you
[2:05:29] it's not there to see how much
[2:05:30] punishment you can take it's there to
[2:05:32] make you stronger because after every
[2:05:35] test after every trial you come out
[2:05:37] stronger
[2:05:38] you come out more pure you come out
[2:05:40] closer to god because that's the way god
[2:05:42] purifies us
[2:05:43] that's why the prophet mentioned things
[2:05:46] finances
[2:05:48] sickness
[2:05:50] trials
[2:05:51] diseases
[2:05:52] you know
[2:05:53] no troubles worries he says those things
[2:05:56] comes upon us and god takes us through
[2:05:57] them but he makes us stronger
[2:06:00] every one of them makes us stronger
[2:06:02] amen
[2:06:04] because unto them the gospel was
[2:06:05] preached but it didn't profit them
[2:06:07] so the secret is faith is a gift of god
[2:06:11] your foundation
[2:06:12] because without faith it's impossible to
[2:06:14] please god
[2:06:15] you cannot do that
[2:06:17] so in closing
[2:06:21] the devil will always try to get you in
[2:06:22] a corner
[2:06:24] where is the greatest battle
[2:06:27] right here
[2:06:28] that's why paul many times in the bible
[2:06:30] mainly mentioned many times get the mind
[2:06:32] of god
[2:06:33] because that's the battleground
[2:06:35] you've got your own mind where satan has
[2:06:36] got access to
[2:06:38] you can sit in church and you can have
[2:06:40] an evil thought that's right
[2:06:41] you're not immune to that but the
[2:06:44] prophet says is what you do with that
[2:06:45] thought
[2:06:46] that makes the difference you must
[2:06:48] realize that's not my thought it's the
[2:06:49] enemy's thought and you ignore it you
[2:06:51] reject it
[2:06:52] just start to praise god if satan comes
[2:06:54] and attacks you in church and you sit
[2:06:56] there your mind start to wander you must
[2:06:58] realize this is a tactic of the enemy he
[2:07:01] places thoughts
[2:07:02] real thoughts about real problems that
[2:07:04] you face monday
[2:07:06] he's not he knows about your life he
[2:07:08] knows about the trials he knows about
[2:07:09] the situations and he will work on that
[2:07:11] he will give you something that's
[2:07:13] important to you
[2:07:14] and all of a sudden your mind starts to
[2:07:16] drift and you have to have the mind of
[2:07:18] god to say no
[2:07:21] but how do you do it
[2:07:22] the first thing you must shake the devil
[2:07:24] off and just by saying amen
[2:07:28] to the world not to satan amen not to
[2:07:30] those thoughts but to the word amen so
[2:07:33] if he comes again you give a louder amen
[2:07:35] amen there's a tactic behind it
[2:07:38] it's a way that you scare him yes it's a
[2:07:40] way even if you're not somebody that can
[2:07:42] say amen try it once amen when the enemy
[2:07:45] is upon you and he's trying to give you
[2:07:47] that thought just say amen
[2:07:49] and if we refuse to watch just go up our
[2:07:51] higher amen and if he still refused go
[2:07:53] amen and if he still refused stand up
[2:07:56] and clap your hands and say amen
[2:07:58] i'll guarantee you
[2:08:00] i guarantee you he will run
[2:08:02] he will sit down and you will be wide
[2:08:04] awake and you will excited and you will
[2:08:05] be happy and the devil will move away
[2:08:08] from me and you will focus on the word
[2:08:10] amen it's a principle that you must
[2:08:13] understand when it gets you in a corner
[2:08:15] there's a way out of the corner
[2:08:17] the battle is in the mind and even in
[2:08:20] church the battle continues
[2:08:22] satan also comes to church
[2:08:25] there's not a boat out there that says
[2:08:26] not allowed he doesn't care what boat
[2:08:28] you put up
[2:08:30] he even comes and sit next to you
[2:08:32] that's right you believe me oh yeah he
[2:08:35] does it yes in this building there's
[2:08:37] angels
[2:08:38] there's god
[2:08:39] but there's also the enemy
[2:08:42] because he's allowed if he's allowed in
[2:08:43] the throne room of god to come and talk
[2:08:45] he can go anywhere
[2:08:47] but his purpose is not yet to get you
[2:08:48] focused on the word his purpose is to
[2:08:50] distract you that's right so the mind of
[2:08:52] god then becomes a battlefield that's
[2:08:54] why he says arm yourself with the mind
[2:08:55] of god because when the enemy comes in
[2:08:58] the mind of god can raise up and say
[2:08:59] amen amen amen hallelujah thank you
[2:09:02] jesus and it becomes an expression
[2:09:05] amen
[2:09:06] remember when jesus was there and he was
[2:09:08] tempted he went out into the wilderness
[2:09:10] and the bible says he fasted 40 days
[2:09:13] he never got hungry
[2:09:16] he was just
[2:09:17] praying fasting for and after 40 days
[2:09:20] the bible says he became hungry
[2:09:22] when he became hungry who was the first
[2:09:23] one who appeared
[2:09:26] first one think about it
[2:09:28] the enemy himself where was the enemy
[2:09:30] all the time he was next to him
[2:09:32] he never bothered him on day one
[2:09:35] day 15 day 39
[2:09:38] but on day 40 when he became weak he was
[2:09:41] dead
[2:09:42] when the devil says no he's weak
[2:09:45] right yeah he says yeah i am
[2:09:48] you know the bible where does it go
[2:09:50] bible
[2:09:51] bible
[2:09:53] bible he says the bible says
[2:09:55] if you're hungry you can speak to these
[2:09:57] stones and create bread
[2:09:59] that's how evil and how sly now he is
[2:10:01] that's why you have to have the mind of
[2:10:03] god because if you ever have the mind of
[2:10:04] god it will make sense and say yes amen
[2:10:07] i can create bread let me create it but
[2:10:09] it wasn't the season it wasn't the time
[2:10:11] for that scripture
[2:10:12] and he says depart from me because the
[2:10:14] bible also says men shall not live by
[2:10:16] bread alone
[2:10:18] remember jesus at the mind of god
[2:10:20] because everything that was in god was
[2:10:21] brought into him so one day he's coming
[2:10:23] there and he gets to the well and he
[2:10:26] sits there and he tells his disciples go
[2:10:27] buy food i'm very hungry
[2:10:30] you remember that
[2:10:31] and they all depart into town and he
[2:10:33] sits at the well but he's waiting for
[2:10:34] the woman at the world
[2:10:36] and when the woman of the well comes he
[2:10:37] deserves her he tells her her husband's
[2:10:39] situation and she runs back into the
[2:10:41] city and here comes the disciples with
[2:10:44] packs of food
[2:10:47] maybe chicken and chips and everything
[2:10:49] they had those days breads and so on and
[2:10:51] if they packed it then this master
[2:10:52] here's the food let's eat
[2:10:54] and all of a sudden he says i'm not
[2:10:56] hungry anymore
[2:10:57] they thought he had something else to
[2:10:58] eat while they were gone
[2:11:00] he says no
[2:11:01] meat for me is to do my father's work
[2:11:04] that to me feeds me more than any food
[2:11:06] that you can ever feed me that's the
[2:11:09] principle it is better than your food to
[2:11:11] do the work of the father to do the word
[2:11:13] of god
[2:11:15] so when he was fast at 40 days he became
[2:11:17] weak and then the enemy comes you need
[2:11:19] the mind of god to then fight him
[2:11:22] he will look at you when you're weak he
[2:11:23] will come and he will
[2:11:25] speak to you yeah
[2:11:27] start to talk to you
[2:11:28] not when you're on top of the mountain
[2:11:30] yeah he will leave you until you cool
[2:11:32] down
[2:11:33] because he knows you cannot be on the
[2:11:34] mountain forever there's no christian on
[2:11:36] the mountain forever you can run up and
[2:11:38] down the aisle you can be excited and we
[2:11:40] are excited but guess what somewhere in
[2:11:42] this journey you're going down into a
[2:11:43] valley and he waits for you down in the
[2:11:45] bottom of the valley he's waiting
[2:11:48] and when you arrive they start to tell
[2:11:49] you god don't love you
[2:11:51] god has left you
[2:11:53] you are on your own
[2:11:55] he doesn't care for you
[2:11:57] and then starts but the mind of god says
[2:11:59] then
[2:12:00] he says he never leave me no forsake
[2:12:03] he's an ever-present help in a time of
[2:12:05] trouble even if i don't feel him even if
[2:12:07] i don't see him i still believe that he
[2:12:09] cannot leave me i won't feel anything
[2:12:11] even if i see no miracle in my life i
[2:12:13] still believe in miracles even if i see
[2:12:15] no healing i still believe in healing
[2:12:17] that's the approach the mind of god
[2:12:20] expression
[2:12:22] amen
[2:12:23] so the devil will even use the word to
[2:12:25] confuse you
[2:12:27] and he will even use the message to
[2:12:28] confuse you
[2:12:30] the mind of god then brings clarity
[2:12:32] say no no no something is wrong here
[2:12:35] amen yes so if you go into the mind of
[2:12:37] god
[2:12:40] as the the word then declares
[2:12:42] when jesus when god spoke to job and he
[2:12:44] asked him the question
[2:12:45] where were you when the sons of god
[2:12:47] shouted for joy
[2:12:49] it's a good question
[2:12:51] where were you when the gods when the
[2:12:52] sons of god shouted for joy
[2:12:55] the prophet says job was in the mind of
[2:12:57] god as a son of god
[2:13:00] given the expression of rejoicing about
[2:13:03] what god has done
[2:13:05] so in the mind of god job was a was a
[2:13:07] servant and he was worshiping god
[2:13:10] now where were you when the sons of god
[2:13:12] shouted for joy
[2:13:13] you were also in the mind of god before
[2:13:15] there was time god saw you in the church
[2:13:18] and he saw you how you loved the word
[2:13:19] and he could see you raising your hand
[2:13:21] and say oh god i love you it's an
[2:13:23] expression yes gloria how did abel know
[2:13:26] how to bring the correct sacrifice
[2:13:30] a blood sacrifice
[2:13:32] by revelation
[2:13:34] amen where were you when jesus christ
[2:13:36] went to the cross
[2:13:39] when god says in my mind he's already
[2:13:40] crucified where were you
[2:13:43] you were in him hallelujah when he went
[2:13:45] to the cross you as the bride were in
[2:13:46] him
[2:13:47] that's why you went that walk with him
[2:13:49] into the cross
[2:13:50] where were you when the lamb's book of
[2:13:52] life was written
[2:13:53] ready it's already written
[2:13:55] your name is already in the book
[2:13:57] when was your name put down there
[2:14:00] before the foundation how did god do it
[2:14:02] because he saw you in his mind amen
[2:14:04] that's why you can never go lost when
[2:14:06] god wrote your name there you have got
[2:14:08] an eternal certainty that it's not him
[2:14:11] that will have no in the drama but god
[2:14:12] that give of grace amen
[2:14:15] amen amen
[2:14:17] so we can start to doubt our doubts
[2:14:20] we can start to really know that you
[2:14:22] know what is not up to me
[2:14:24] god has given me so much grace
[2:14:27] that i can look at him and say lord
[2:14:29] thank you for the mind of christ thank
[2:14:31] you that i don't have to depend on the
[2:14:32] canary brain that you've given me
[2:14:34] that i can ignore it and know it's so
[2:14:36] stupid it's so you know it can reason
[2:14:38] things and it can be upset about things
[2:14:40] but the mind of god has got a different
[2:14:42] approach
[2:14:44] so the greatest battle is in the mind
[2:14:47] and it's basically about
[2:14:49] your ideas versus god's mind amen your
[2:14:52] ideas versus the word of god
[2:14:54] because satan uses that channel
[2:14:57] to plant all kinds of things
[2:14:59] and you must just say put it through the
[2:15:01] word filter to say no
[2:15:03] the mind of god to me
[2:15:06] is important
[2:15:07] the mind of god to me gives me
[2:15:09] revelation
[2:15:10] it shows me my position
[2:15:12] it helps me to live a daily life godly
[2:15:15] dedicated to him
[2:15:17] that i can go from this place and know
[2:15:19] that i'm more than a conqueror
[2:15:21] i'm more than able to overcome every
[2:15:24] test of every trial amen because with
[2:15:26] our own mind
[2:15:27] you will hurt yourself
[2:15:30] remember that it's not me that said the
[2:15:32] prophet says
[2:15:33] you're gonna injure yourself with this
[2:15:36] mind
[2:15:37] so don't think like this
[2:15:41] think what how god would have done it
[2:15:44] think and pray and say lord
[2:15:46] give me inspiration
[2:15:48] give me guidance
[2:15:49] when i make decisions let me pray for
[2:15:51] your will
[2:15:52] let me pray for your mind to guide me
[2:15:54] because then i'll make the right
[2:15:56] decisions
[2:15:57] that i don't go in my own world and my
[2:15:59] own desires but that your will will
[2:16:00] guide me
[2:16:02] like the prophet had many desires
[2:16:05] one of his greatest desires was to go
[2:16:06] and live in the bush
[2:16:09] he says if i can just live in the bush
[2:16:11] and if god gives me a message i'll run
[2:16:13] out i'll deliver it and i'll run back
[2:16:15] it was his mind his desire
[2:16:18] but then god comes to me and says it's
[2:16:20] the wrong mind it's the wrong desire
[2:16:23] just because you'll end up totally
[2:16:25] deserted your wife won't even leave you
[2:16:26] yeah god knew that
[2:16:29] he says my mind for you is you're a
[2:16:31] prophet ordained for the end time you're
[2:16:33] gonna preach and you're gonna record
[2:16:35] every message because there's people
[2:16:37] coming that needs that word
[2:16:39] that was god's mind i am thankful for
[2:16:41] god's mind in the prophet that he didn't
[2:16:43] follow his own mind then we would never
[2:16:44] have a message but god is not dictated
[2:16:47] to and god doesn't listen to our mind
[2:16:49] thankfully
[2:16:51] you know
[2:16:52] he does his own thing
[2:16:54] and he will lead us he takes us as
[2:16:56] prisoners of love divine amen
[2:16:59] that he can say like paul says i'm a
[2:17:01] prisoner
[2:17:02] of jesus christ
[2:17:04] i'm a prisoner of love divine
[2:17:07] which means all my
[2:17:08] ideas has been taken away
[2:17:10] all my own thoughts my own
[2:17:13] desires i have surrendered to god yes
[2:17:16] and he is now
[2:17:18] in charge of me
[2:17:19] he decides where i go he decides when i
[2:17:22] go
[2:17:23] your footsteps of the righteous are for
[2:17:25] ordained of god
[2:17:26] and nothing can happen to you that god
[2:17:28] is not allowed
[2:17:30] not even a hair fall from your head
[2:17:32] that's how his thoughts are towards us
[2:17:35] that he knows everything about me he
[2:17:37] knows every he even knows what's going
[2:17:38] to happen till the day i die
[2:17:40] if he should tarry and if my name is
[2:17:42] written next to the rapture
[2:17:45] i will go in the rapture
[2:17:46] it's whatever god has planned and
[2:17:48] designed so it brings peace
[2:17:51] to know i'm not going to produce
[2:17:52] anything amen i'm going to walk by faith
[2:17:56] believing the word of god
[2:17:58] and that takes of pressure
[2:18:00] because it's not up to me
[2:18:02] because remember you're living in a
[2:18:04] world of pressure
[2:18:05] you know what's pressure-like
[2:18:07] at school you've got pressure at work
[2:18:09] you've got pressure you've got deadlines
[2:18:11] you've got so many pressures upon life
[2:18:14] and it's just adding and adding and
[2:18:15] adding and adding and the prophet says
[2:18:17] we live in a time where it's so
[2:18:19] difficult
[2:18:21] but it's spiritually it's the same thing
[2:18:22] there's pressure all around us
[2:18:25] but it's the mind of god in you that
[2:18:27] gives you the ability
[2:18:28] to handle that pressure
[2:18:31] to withstand that pressure
[2:18:33] because he's an equalizer he's a god
[2:18:35] that says in the time of trouble when
[2:18:37] the enemy comes in like a flood i'll
[2:18:40] raise up the standard of the word
[2:18:43] so what happens
[2:18:44] as the pressure goes on the outside
[2:18:48] in the inside where's the word it raises
[2:18:50] as well
[2:18:51] that's right so if the pressure on the
[2:18:53] outside goes to 100 bar and you feel
[2:18:55] you're going to explode
[2:18:56] just go to the scripture and say lord
[2:18:58] increase
[2:18:59] the word inside of me
[2:19:01] so if the pressure on the outside comes
[2:19:03] to 100 bar and the pressure on the
[2:19:04] inside comes to 100 bar what is the
[2:19:06] pressure
[2:19:08] zero
[2:19:09] you don't have to face anything that's
[2:19:11] right just get god to raise up the
[2:19:13] standard and you will be
[2:19:14] at peace
[2:19:16] the pressure will still be there the
[2:19:18] problem will still be there but now
[2:19:19] you're at peace because you've found the
[2:19:20] grace of god amen to live in a difficult
[2:19:23] circumstance
[2:19:25] the way that god wants you to live or
[2:19:27] because of the mind of god that's why
[2:19:28] paul says arm yourself
[2:19:31] use it as a weapon
[2:19:33] get something to fight this enemy with
[2:19:35] think like god with a thing that's why
[2:19:37] he says you are sons and daughters of
[2:19:38] god
[2:19:39] and that's why the prophet says the word
[2:19:41] is in the bride
[2:19:43] she knows what to do of the word
[2:19:45] she knows how to handle the word because
[2:19:48] of that principle
[2:19:50] the mind of god
[2:19:52] the word of god
[2:19:53] inside that little pride
[2:19:55] amen let's buy it
[2:20:05] lord as we bow in your presence today
[2:20:08] we are so thankful for your word
[2:20:11] for the revelation it brings
[2:20:14] for the understanding it brings in the
[2:20:15] stability amen
[2:20:17] that lord doesn't matter what happens to
[2:20:19] us oh lord there is always a certainty
[2:20:20] that god is in control
[2:20:23] when we come to thee of father god we
[2:20:25] ask thee that you will be gracious unto
[2:20:27] everyone here this morning
[2:20:29] that you all father god help us to
[2:20:31] understand that the mind of god has been
[2:20:33] delivered by your word
[2:20:35] that we have a clarity by the baptism of
[2:20:37] the holy spirit in our lives to walk
[2:20:39] this life
[2:20:40] that when the enemy comes oh god let us
[2:20:42] not become despondent or run to our own
[2:20:44] means but that we always turn to thee
[2:20:47] to say oh god my help comes from the
[2:20:49] lord
[2:20:50] the one who created the heavens and the
[2:20:52] earth lord i pray for every brother
[2:20:53] every sister every child in this
[2:20:55] building
[2:20:56] may you give us the grace and the
[2:20:57] understanding of god to raise up to the
[2:20:59] occasion
[2:21:00] to face the enemy and to know oh god we
[2:21:03] are more than able through christ jesus
[2:21:04] our lord

[2:21:17] you supply for them
[2:21:19] and may we know father god that there is
[2:21:21] a great battle in the mind
[2:21:23] but the oh god the weapon has been
[2:21:25] delivered in the form of the mind of god
[2:21:27] that give us the victory over every
[2:21:29] situation
[2:21:30] that we are the people of the sound mind
[2:21:32] this morning

[2:21:36] revelation

[2:21:39] everyone

[2:40:31] god bless you
[2:40:35] god bless you saints
[2:40:40] [Music]
[2:40:42] about a few weeks ago
[2:40:45] i came for prayer
[2:40:48] what happened was
[2:40:51] i think
[2:40:52] 2018 as we arrived one of the
[2:40:56] welcome pegs included a sun fly biting
[2:41:00] my neck
[2:41:01] and i think it bit a little bit too high
[2:41:04] so the skin went
[2:41:06] deeper on the inside then
[2:41:09] the dead cells started gathering
[2:41:10] together in that hole that it formed
[2:41:14] and then it became quite a huge
[2:41:17] cyst in there
[2:41:19] and
[2:41:21] out of the blue all of a sudden it
[2:41:23] started being painful but what happened
[2:41:26] was
[2:41:28] i was sharing with her sister on a
[2:41:30] saturday morning and she had a problem
[2:41:32] with her neck i said to her we'll pray
[2:41:35] together then i went to go light and
[2:41:36] when i woke up
[2:41:38] my neck was extremely so i couldn't and
[2:41:40] i could not do anything then i found
[2:41:42] that the cyst was very much inflamed
[2:41:45] then i
[2:41:46] i came for prayer on the sunday
[2:41:48] i remember after service the pastor said
[2:41:51] to me you know what while i was praying
[2:41:52] for you i felt something then i said to
[2:41:54] you thank you
[2:41:57] and
[2:41:58] the monday i tried booking the
[2:41:59] appointment nothing happened they said i
[2:42:02] can come on the tuesday then when i went
[2:42:04] on the tuesday the doctor looked at the
[2:42:06] seat and said it's badly inflamed i
[2:42:08] can't even touch it
[2:42:10] i can only measure it after measuring it
[2:42:12] he said
[2:42:14] at the moment we can't do anything i'd
[2:42:15] like to take it out but
[2:42:17] i can't touch it
[2:42:19] so take the pain kill up take
[2:42:22] the antibiotics go away for two weeks i
[2:42:25] looked at him i said
[2:42:27] i must stay with us for two weeks he
[2:42:28] said yes go away for two weeks
[2:42:31] then come back in two weeks let's take
[2:42:32] it out
[2:42:34] then
[2:42:36] as i was busy taking the medication i
[2:42:39] thought of a testimony where brother
[2:42:41] branham prayed for the two sisters
[2:42:44] one had a tumor can remember what the
[2:42:46] other one was struggling from but
[2:42:49] the angel visited the neighborhood they
[2:42:51] got healed i said lord i actually don't
[2:42:55] want an operation i know i'm not a vain
[2:42:58] person
[2:42:59] but an operation where people are going
[2:43:01] to see i don't want a scar
[2:43:05] and
[2:43:06] i left there
[2:43:07] then
[2:43:08] it was hardly three days after then i
[2:43:11] realized that the cyst is starting to
[2:43:13] clear itself up
[2:43:15] but whenever it clears when you finish
[2:43:18] when you're touching you can see there's
[2:43:19] no opening where you say it opened here
[2:43:22] it cleared it will just open and clear
[2:43:24] and close itself again
[2:43:27] then
[2:43:28] it happened for about seven to nine days
[2:43:30] then it was totally cleared up then i
[2:43:32] said okay fine the doctor said i must
[2:43:34] come let me book with him to go see him
[2:43:37] when i when i tried booking they said he
[2:43:39] was off he's got covet
[2:43:41] then it extended by a week then on the
[2:43:44] third week when i went he looked at it
[2:43:46] he said
[2:43:48] i would have loved to remove the whole
[2:43:50] thing
[2:43:51] but as you said it creates itself
[2:43:53] there's nothing in there anymore there
[2:43:55] is nothing i can do we don't need to do
[2:43:56] an operation wow then i was like thank
[2:43:59] god because i am i did not want the
[2:44:02] operation yet i wanted the cyst to go
[2:44:04] and the lord made a way
[2:44:06] that it cleared itself
[2:44:08] there's no scar
[2:44:10] you cannot even see how it cleared
[2:44:12] itself because the skin looked the same
[2:44:14] everywhere
[2:44:15] so it can only be the hand of the lord
[2:44:17] and i just wanted to bring praise and
[2:44:19] thanks to the lord because i came for
[2:44:21] prayer and the lord answered prayer
[2:44:27] amen
[2:44:29] amen is the god who wants us back praise
[2:44:32] the lord well god bless your friends
