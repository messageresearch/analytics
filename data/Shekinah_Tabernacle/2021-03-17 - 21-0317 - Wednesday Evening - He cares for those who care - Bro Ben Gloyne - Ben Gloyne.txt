you musicians amen praise the lord hallelujah amen if you want to stand with me tonight we're going to go to uh john 21 and and verse 22. and um some of this is familiar to you from about 5 30 this morning i apologize i preached to um brother moses in south africa this morning i took their tuesday evening service this morning at i know whatever time that was so i mean anyway but i think it'll come from a slightly different angle but so john 21 and 22 and then we're going to read um then we're going to go to first we're going to first beat a 5 and 6. john 21 and 22. let's start from verse 20 actually sorry then peter turning about saith the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast and supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thief peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do jesus said unto him if he will that i tarry that he tarry till i come what is it what is that to thee follow thou me so really in a nutshell what is it all this other stuff what is it to thee follow him and then we'll go to first peter five six and seven i'm glad how our lord does the impossible i love that song amen praise the lord i just say amen amen first peter 5 and verses 6 and 7 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you amen if you have a need on your heart you just want to lift to yeah before the lord before we go yo as we go to prayers when i also remember brother anias in prayer he had a operation a couple of weeks ago and he's still recovering from it so this just goes the lord together shall we gracious heavenly father we're so thankful because of your greaty toning blood which is more than enough lord it has reconciled us to you and we want to thank you that it puts us in speaking terms it puts us in that condition that we can talk to you and you can talk back to us and i just want to ask that you would you see every hand that's been raised in divine presence lord jesus and i just pray that you'll meet every need lord may you touch every life we do not gather here just just to go through a religious motion lord but we've come to meet you that's our heart's desire is to come in contact with the king of kings and lord of lords and so may you grant that lord we also want to remember brother honest lord as he is recovering from this operation lord we thank you that by your stripes he is healed lord you are still the great physician today as you were 2 000 years ago so i just pray you just continue to rapidly recover his strength oh god and just touch his body and heal him lord we thank you lord that he is on that path to recovery but i just pray you'll just be a real quick work o god for your glory and we commit the service into your hands lord as always we think of those who did not come tonight lord by lord maybe by reason of sickness or traveling whatever it may be i pray you'll touch their lives as well wherever they are and meet their needs lord may you grant it we thank you for this opportunity to be in your presence once again in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats tonight i just want to take a bit of a thought now this may go away kind of a segue but you know this uh my title brother ed said what's your title and i kind of scratched my head and i said well he cares for those who care and he says well it's locked in so you can't change it but it may not go down that way but um this it's very interesting this word care says casting all your care upon him for he careth for you now this word uh your care or care there it actually comes through the idea of a distraction so it's more than just a burden or a worry but it's actually something that's a distracting thing now what i like about my notes is i can go to the last page and i can go from the last page and i want to ask you a question it's well not really but i just want you to get think about this how does it how does a spirit achieve its goal now sometimes we think of a demon possession that's the devil achieving a goal or maybe a oppression that's the devil achieving a goal but i want to say if a spirit can actually push you off out of that realm of actually just walking in the sweetness of the holy ghost where nothing else matters and you're just totally abandoned to god that spirit has actually its goal it's achieved that goal you take um someone no now this is distractions we're gonna we're gonna take these distractions we're gonna stomp on them and return to sender that's basically the plan tonight okay so so so so for example someone comes along with a spirit just say it's coldness it's rebellion it's lust it's indifference it's you know sarcastic or it's you know a tail bearer gossip whatever it may be see and and you can identify that you're in contact with something that is not of god it may never overtake you it may never you know it may never possess you or even even even um you know what he could torment you in your mind but if it changes your worship to the lord that now your worship is different and the sweetness of the lord in your life has been replaced with walls and being reserved and you no longer act the same way you did before coming coming in contact with that spirit then i'll say that that spirit has achieved its goal amen because say well i don't have those spirits but but if it's pushed you off the path a bit it's achieved its goal but we're called to be steadfast but that steadfastness is going to be challenged i mean because the devil loves the challenge but god is never afraid of a challenge he loves a challenge too because he always overcomes every challenge so you know so if i if a spirit's pushed you a certain way that you're no longer worshiping you know you've left your first love then it's achieved its goal but we're here to to get back on the road if you're off the road i'm so thankful there's always a way back hallelujah so so this is what i want to talk about when i talk about the casting all your care upon him because he cares for you because this care is an idea of a of a distraction so anything now when i talk about distractions tonight i'm not going to talk about this i'm not going to talk about social media i'm not talking about all the easy stuff i'm going to talk about a distraction that's more subtle but actually is more powerful is that the distraction of the influence of a spirit because the influence of a spirit can be lingering in your life that what happens is you're no longer walking you know in in the love of god you know that sweetness of god when you first meet him you say well you're going by feelings tonight no i'm not love produces a feeling you know when you really know the love of god it's more than a doctrine it's not a doctrine it's a reality it's an experience where you fall in love with jesus christ and all you care about you know you live in the same body you may live in the same house the same job the same school the same friends the same everything the same church but the world is different i mean the sky looks different the clouds look different the flowers look different i mean even you look different in the mirror hallelujah your whole life is different because you've come in contact with life and that is life eternal and you're not too worried you know you may have the same challenges you had the day before but it's a little bit different today why because you're falling in love and it's like you're kind of floating around on floating along on cloud9 for a while the devil don't like people floating on that cloud he wants to push them off that place but i tell you tonight the bride is in love with jesus christ it's a love affair this message is a love letter amen between you and jesus christ hallelujah i believe the more that eliezer told rebecca about isaac the more she fell in love with isaac tell me more eleazar tell me more what does he really look like hallelujah and it was love at first what everything that he he she heard about on the journey amen just produced a love in her heart that when they came together when she saw isaac it was love at first sight and the scripture says that even him you have not seen yet you love hallelujah can you really love someone you've never seen absolutely hallelujah when it comes to the lord jesus amen absolutely you fall in love with him i tell you it's real the love of god is real amen but the devil doesn't want us to stay in love amen brother brahm says in the church age book i don't have the quote on me but he talks about the reformation time it would be the wrath of man if i get the words right praising god so so man what they would do is because denominations would rise and and arguments would rise people would worship god because they're angry at this guy so just say there's a split in the church you know they would keep worshiping god because of an offense that someone else caused as opposed to a pure relationship with god you say well we're not in a reformation era no we're not this is a transformation time this is a restoration time it means we're called to be restored back to our first love i mean that the church fell from hallelujah so we should never worship god because this guy did something to us you know we're going to separate between the person and the spirit right so when i'm talking about a distraction i'm not talking about a person and what i love about the scripture is god tells us where he's going to set up his banqueting feast hallelujah amen yeah we'll get there we'll get there so we don't have to worry really you know the apostle paul would say in uh first corinthians two and two let's just let's just go to this here um you know to overcome you have to overcome every we're gonna overcome everything we may have different walks and different battles but we're going to we're going to gather around the throne and we're going to give testimony of all that jesus overcame in our lives because he's the overcomer right and so there's going to be spirits and trouble and the effects of spirits that we have to overcome even even you know i always marvel when i think about i love caleb and joshua i love the story of the exodus of the going out and coming in and um it's amazing to me yeah you know it just it's so amazing how that younger generation broke the cycle of unbelief they were growing up with parents that weren't really believers but they were just church members but a revelation anchored in their hearts we're taking the land that when they came to the crossing over time they did not murmur they didn't complain they didn't have hearts of unbelief but they believed so that goes to show that you can be young people you can be living in a church where all the adults aren't believers but maybe a few all the others just hypocrites but god can do a work in your life that god will break the cycle that the effect of the unbelief of the parents will not filter down to the younger generation but the younger generation we're more than able to take this land amen let's go into the fullness of the holy ghost and get everything that belongs to us hallelujah so i love that because it just goes to show it doesn't matter what environment you know i was you know i saw a headline i should find the article but it said about how actually amazing people are birthed out of great trauma where it's actually been shown that actually amazing people they can come from very traumatic backgrounds but actually forges a certain character in them that they would never have had if they had an ideal upbringing amen i'll go read the article they'll get back to you on that one but apparently they've done a study on it and that's what they're shown so it's incredible that you know to me it goes to show you know we can we can give the best atmosphere and environment and family life and church life to our children but takes god amen it can be all stacked against them all for them but it takes god to light that flame amen and that's what we need is we need a good you know i heard brother brown today he was saying though he used to i i can't remember who was praying but but but he was relating a prayer someone said he said basically lord wrap him up and burlap sex pour a gallon of kerosene on him light him a fire and just send him forth you know hallelujah you know there's like a human torch going forth and you know i pray god does that for us all of us amen hallelujah wrap us in burlap sacks can you imagine that amen hallelujah and we ask lord bless them and keep them no no set them a flame god pour in your oil hallelujah wrap them up and hallelujah amen a human torch hallelujah so you know we can live in such a place that you know it doesn't matter where our upbringing is how ideal and ideal when god gets a hold of your life that's that's the difference maker right there now the apostle paul wait oh yeah corinthians not colossians that would have been interesting now let's go to um well you're probably already there but i obviously didn't get there the apostle paul was a prophet he could see god could show him things about people's lives but this is the one thing he really cared about when he came in amongst the believers he did not want to when he was journeying from church to church though he knew a lot of the people because they birthed under his ministry he wasn't interested in knowing what was going on in the church right he didn't want to line the ministers up before he preached and say now tell me all your problems and tell me what spirits are lingering around and tell me what's going on now he wasn't interested in that he just says for i determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified that's all he wanted to know among them was actually god was living that's all he was interested in you know there'll be a lot there'll always be problems in the church there'll always be spirits in the church whether we like it or not there'll always be spirits there'll always be unbelief there'll always be trouble right up into the rapture right but unbelief doesn't hinder god hallelujah there was a lot of unbelief in the days of jesus amen but one woman with the blood or she said i'm going to push through all of that i'm going to touch the hem of his garment i mean blind bartimaeus had a lot of trouble one day when he heard jesus walking by and that don't worry it's got three legs it won't fall over um you know you know he was told you know who is passing by because he would just lie there you know lean against the wall your brick wall of the city and the sun would yo heat the bricks and then heat his back and you know he heard a bunch of noise going by and he'd say who is that who's coming what's going on because he's blind he can't see and then someone came along says it's jesus of nazareth i mean he's passing by and they say jesus who's this guy i said well he's you know he's he's raised the dead he's healed the sick he's you open the eyes of the blind you know he's done all these things and all the bible stories his mother told him growing up became living reality right in front of him and he began to cry out jesus thou son of david have mercy on me another saying quiet quiet be quiet be quiet yeah but but he did not let that hinder him what was that those people telling him to be quiet was unbelievable trying to push down his faith but he was determined here's my opportunity amen it was actually his faith that got a hold of jesus and jesus who is walking to calvary it says and jesus stood still hallelujah to answer his prayer wouldn't you love it tonight if jesus stood still he's walking by and your your faith grabs ahold of me stan still says what do you have need of unbelief doesn't hinder god hallelujah he will still get the job done amen if he's coming for and he's coming for me if he's coming for you know if he's coming for six of us well that's the glowing family hallelujah that's how we should be if he's coming for one if the rapture's one person here i am i'm here to get my blessing i'm here to get my refilling i'm here to worship god you know i came to the conclusion i don't preach for you guys i preach as a worship for god that may sound a bit crazy to you but you know we should sing a sing should be a worship you know the tech teams of worship amen we in the pews of worship hallelujah how we treat each other should be a worship i mean our whole life should be a worship to god so my preachings are really a worship to my father hallelujah well why are you here then you may think well no it's for you too but you know what i mean i don't do it for you and as opposed to you're patting me on the back and saying well done in a human thing i do it because i love him because i love him i love you amen hope that came out the right way now so all he wanted to know was jesus christ and him crucified among them and that's now what i'm talking about is not turning a blind eye i'm not talking about that because people might say well you're just trying to turn a blind eye and die no no no it's not about that what are we looking for we we have to come to the conclusion as i said the devil will be here until the rapture and then we leave and he stays right hell will be opened up those devils will still be here the moment we are gone they'll still be here so we have to come to the conclusion there's always going to be a battle even coming to church can be a battle and i'm just talking about myself amen but but the the more a battle comes it shows that revival is going to break forth there's always trouble amen legion was on one side of the sea and jesus was coming to to set him free on the other side and what happened it wasn't an easy trip across but a storm was whipped up because the devils are saying you're not crossing that sea you're not getting a hold of legion we've got him pinned down pretty good i mean but then the disciples finally woke the master he stood up said peace be still i mean the boat got to the other side wide to set legion free there's trouble before the victory hallelujah amen israel was was what yo yo israel's bondage in egypt got worse before the deliverance you know because you know because pharaoh said fine we give you straw now you get your own straw to make the brick so so the oppression became worse before the deliverance came but the deliverer was standing right there i mean to do the job hallelujah i mean so the same thing with you and i i mean the battle could be getting harder but that just shows the victory is getting nearer hallelujah amen so don't don't don't lose heart whatever just just don't lose heart keep your eyes on the promise amen don't worry about these distractions hallelujah amen now let's just go to that because these page numbers don't mean anything um let's go to psalms 23 5 and 6 brother andy's already gone to my punch line but there we go it's fine i'm sure there's another one somewhere coming up this is nothing like this morning i got the same notes pretty much but it's fine psalms so some people get in their mind that they need to get the devil or away before they can rejoice i'll take your silence as an acknowledgement of what i've just said you know some people think well we've just got to clear the devil out we've got to get rid of all the trouble we've got to get rid of all the unbelief and then god could move but i wanted i want you to notice the type of restaurant god sets up hallelujah he knows where to feed his children he knows where to set up a table and he sets it up in a specific place do we have psalms 23 right there can we can we yeah there we go amen he says now thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies so this is where god sets up his restaurant hallelujah he's going to say son and daughter i'm i'm putting a table right here where are you going to put this table god is going to be by the seaside it's going to be on a nice mountain or you know is it just going to be up in heaven someplace where the devils no more i know i put a real nice place where your enemy is where that spirit is that troubles you and oppresses you and comes against you and this chatter chatter and this gossip whatever more he puts the table right there hallelujah and then and then he comes along says i'll i'll now take you to your seat and you think i'm going to get the best seat in the restaurant and you walk past all the nice places and then you come to really but that guy's here i'm not pointing at anyone now okay i'm talking about spirit i'm just dramatizing you know but but that spirit's there and this guy that i fought with for decades and this one and and you know this spirit's here and god says yep eat right here why because he prepares a table for us in the presence of his enemies why because he wants you to eat he wants you to feast in a place that he's telling the devil devil these people don't care that you're present it doesn't affect their worship it doesn't bother them none it doesn't matter if all of hell is in this room right now they're going to feast they're going to rejoice they're going to praise god why because they are children of the most high god and they are built to eat this food this diet hallelujah hallelujah some people can't eat certain foods but we can eat this word i mean we can actually stomach this message harlow we're built to stomach this feast hello there's none of this there's none of the seven course menu that we say no don't like that i can't eat that it's just like yup how many plates can i carry you know how many stacks can i do you know hallelujah hallelujah amen so he prepares a table so we should never be surprised that the devil is there when we're trying to worship god we should never ever be surprised because god says i'm going to sit i'm going to put you in the prince of your enemies you're going to eat so we should actually expect that it's like some troubling thought comes in your mind some cold feeling some in different feelings oh you're here i knew you'd be here because the word says you'd be here hallelujah amen he says surely and thou anoint us my head with oil my cup runeth over so this is what's going to happen when we're going to feast in the presence of our enemy amen the lord is going to anoint our head anoint our revelation and the stimulation of that revelation is going to run over everywhere hallelujah say well that person is eating real messy no i'm just having a good time where's those table manners gone you don't need no table matters in this place hallelujah why because he anoints my head with oil and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life amen and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever hallelujah now it's very interesting i have never ever been to a banquet where where where people sit down and they get the maybe the starter or the first time they ever sample some food i've never ever heard someone saying a sarcastic or very kind of passive-aggressive tone well i hope brother so-and-so eating you know i was eating this today hope sister so-and-so is eating this one today i hope she gets that steak and i hope that i've never heard that normally it's i'm enjoying this or sometimes it just goes silent because you got no time to talk because you're eating it's only a sign of a good feast when everyone's actually just the stomach goes this way the napkin goes up this way you know but everyone's like oh this tastes so good and what's happening is they're enjoying the experience of eating and they're not really worried about oh that person better order this and this person better order that and this person better hear this and this person and they got their pitchfork out trying to shovel things around no i've never ever i've never experienced that hallelujah if they do say i hope so and so enjoys us it's out of a loving heart because they're enjoying it too hallelujah so i've never ever been to a ba who's been to a banquet like that that'd be an experience wouldn't it you know what's wrong with my table guess why they told me hallelujah now brother brown says that the parable of the wedding supper feast is a call to the pentecostal feast so he so so he parallels where the servants go out and eventually they have to go to the highways and byways and get the good and the bad the indifferent the whoevers the unlikelies and call them to the feast of the king and brother bam says that this is actually that parable is overlays the three pills of his ministry where the third pool gets those in the highways and the byways hello highways and byways people it wasn't the first pool that you know pulled me off the second pole that pulled me you know i read about brother brown's ministry you know i read perry green's uh biography the acts of the prophet you know before i became a believer and that you know it was amazing but it didn't grip my heart but when i heard that voice when i heard that voice behind the voice speaking of redemption and completeness and enjoy and why so many fail to keep the victory in the seal of god that gripped me why because the word was pulling hallelujah and it should be that same hour with you and i the word should be pulling us amen into a closer walk with god hallelujah when you hear that message you read the bible something he says lord i just want more of you i want less of the world lord fill me up you know what's cool you pour something into something right you pour a liquid into something it actually empties out eventually all the other stuff who's ever seen that video people say well you know you know people say it's like uh prayer you know but not always but it's like a jug of like red water and someone keeps pouring in white and eventually all the red water is gone because it's been replaced by what's being poured in it's the same thing with god you got things in your life you want to get rid of just let him pour himself in he'll he'll empty out everything else remember you can contain only so much hallelujah and if there's no room for the devil the devil ain't going to be there hallelujah if if you're filled up with god to be filled with the fullness of god so the ex full extent of your being is all god the devil has got no room hallelujah you know there'll be times when the girls were young and they'd be you know up in that in you know end up in our bed and there'll be christine and the three girls and then i would probably go yeah i'll get the youngest put them there and i'd look at the bed and say i have no room here why because the bed was full hallelujah it's like the devil you know he should come along and say can i fit is there anywhere i can get in you know i said no there's no room amen this place is full hallelujah with the goodness of god amen hallelujah amen he says now amen and her religious system is wronger than the moral she becomes in doing this she has now joined herself all these churches and of the nation into the federation of churches and has taken the mark of the beast what a thing why christ gave them the opportunity come to my feast the feast of pentecost which means 50. when the holy ghost poured out on russia they was called to a feast of pentecost a spiritual feast and they turned it down england the holy ghost was poured out upon them they turned it down america the holy ghost was poured out upon them and they turned it down he bit three times three times he sent out they did not listen to the feast then he sent again and he said go and compel those people to come the table has got to be set the table is ready there's still room and i believe that maybe within maybe the next few months or something or a year whatever it is god is going to send another shaking across the country for there is somebody still out there i like i apply this today i don't put this back in 1963 and is your life worthy of the gospel i believe this is today that god is going to send out another shaking stir the water again lord step down to the word and stir it up that we can step in and get healed hallelujah i believe there's going to be another shaking amen cause there's somebody amen for there's somebody still out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere somewhere in the world the nation he says itself is gone but that individual there's still mercy for that person aren't you glad we say lord here i am hallelujah amen that's why the rapture hasn't gone because there's still people to come in glory lord help us find them amen so i like to eat in the presence of my enemy hallelujah i need to take this on board because sometimes what happens is you know we get a funny feeling you know the devil comes in plays with our mind troubles us feel a coldness oh i don't feel like praising god today it's the devil just trying to lull you off to sleep and you know because you know he knows if we get blessed enough if god falls upon us it's over for him amen hallelujah because remember all we need in life is more of god really it's not about mentally trying to figure everything out we just need more of him and if you get more of him when this word puts on flesh it goes from just intellectual and it actually is your god you're the form of the latter reign of the holy ghost falls the teaching and the quickening reign fall together and the word we hear becomes manifested in our lives we're living in that season it's not just teaching and teaching and teaching nothing much happening but now that quickening rain is coming so so what's been taught is now coming to life holy that's why we can look back just a few years of this little place here we see people have been transformed by the holy ghost why because there's been a teaching rain and a quickening rain running together hallelujah it's true isn't it amen so lord keep raining hallelujah yo some people get sick of the rainbow spiritually pour it on glory to god we won't get washed away so we don't need to worry about it hallelujah that's actually for us it's for our good amen so hallelujah now we have to be very aware well as i was saying before the enemy comes along makes us feel a certain way and we react or we worship or we walk with god according to him the devil because that's what the devil wants the devil wants to be worshipped now i'm not talking about literally bowing down and worshiping the devil but i'm talking about the effect of him his influence comes into our lives in subtle ways and we start to look at one another we look at even the word a certain way we look at ourselves our salvation a certain way because of what the devil's trying to put in our lives the blood is more than enough our salvation was without money or price salvation is not based on feeling it's not based on how happy you are the rapture will not be when we all get to a state of nirvana and everything's fine as i've said well i said it at the camp you know you take the two on the way to emmaus all the disciples in luke 24 which was a prophecy these modern events today are made clear by the prophecy which is in luke 24 luke 24 is a prophecy who's heard me say this i'm sure you have yes so so the condition of the believers in luke 24 is prophesying of a people that will be here at the second coming they're not skipping they're not jumping they're not shouting until they meet the law that is but but they think their whole world has fallen apart the two on the way to emmaus are brokenhearted they're down they're walking back to emmaus and the resurrected one the resurrection and the life is walking right with them opening the scripture to them and they're broken-hearted i need to be happy enough to receive a revelation those people were receiving revelation they were brokenhearted you're following me but then they walked but the lord walked with them in that state and then he revealed himself and the reason he revealed himself wasn't that they would know that he just resurrected but that they were part of the resurrection same thing with the message you know we can walk along we can be broke who's ever been ministered to by the lord when you're brokenhearted he's dying to the brokenhearted right so you we don't have to be all happy that we can worship we can we can worship when we're broken-hearted we can praise him when we're broken-hearted i mean so there they were walking along broken-hearted but then he was revealing himself to them because he wanted them to see that they were part of that resurrection because if i live you shall live also same thing he walks with you irrespective of how you're feeling because he wants you to realize you're part of the resurrection that's why the message comes your way i mean so don't beat yourself up for for feeling beaten up don't beat yourself up or feeling down you say well i've been feeling this way a long time there's another morning hallelujah it may be a while but you know seasons always change but who's walking with you who's ministering to you that's god i'll help you out with that answer it's the lord himself the lord walks with his children irrespective of how they're feeling and says look i'm going to minister my word i'm going to pour myself into you but now i'm going to make your eyes come open and you'll see the one walking with you is the one who's going to rapture you ha lucas brother braham said that there's a man standing prison that'll rapture his church hallelujah i like what brother isaac said in that um surveillance sermon you know basically we're like a secret agent we get put in but but but we get told don't worry if it gets too hot i'll pull you out holy i like that that was awesome because that's what the lord's going to do hallelujah amen now hallelujah brother ram said and he swore by himself and you're here the word must be fulfilled and he and he knowed what his life was to fulfill them that's right and you're here to fulfill it too just walk unconscious of fear now he's giving us real good instructions how to walk walk unconscious of criticism walk on conscience i mean unconscious unto the world walk as you walk in christ walk with him not paying any attention the right or the left hand just keep keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with god hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with god if the neighbor don't like you walk with god just keep on walking with god enoch one day walk like that i mean so so so the prophet's telling me enoch had trouble in his church he had sickness he had trouble in his family amen but he just kept walking on with god i mean the enoch one day walk like that you know what he'd done he walked all the way home with god got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore amen walk with god doctor says you're going to die walk with god yeah doctor says you can't walk with god just walk with god that's all for god has promised you i'll never leave you nor forsake you i'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath by that covenant that he give you that he would confirm it just walk with god then you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you've got to go through briar patches over sharp rocks over bluffs down over the hillsides up through the mountains over waters but walk with god yes sir there's so many hills to climb upward we've heard the old song but how little scene when you get to the end of the way my my just look at them it's all been back look back at your footprints they won't be very much so just walk with god he does never say sit down and figure everything out just walk with god walk on with god hallelujah amen this is what we're going to do friends let's just keep walking on with god you know as brother brown would say about if you want to see the old-fashioned meetings again just become a lamb just become lambs again that's all just get back to being sheep the dove hasn't gone very far he's just waiting a chance to get back there's a road back to azusa street there's a place back back to the azusa street meetings again is to return to a lamb nature again so what what that means is basically all the trouble the devil's tried to put down your throat and tried to get you to react a certain way you put it under the blood so if someone you have some spirits come along and try to treat you bad put it under the blood someone's mistreated you put it under the blood just put all those things under the blood and also we're going to keep yeah we're going to remember who we're walking with i'm walking with god it's just me and jesus there's only room for two on this road me and him together three is a crap two's a company three is a crowd and the devil makes it a crowd hallelujah complexes make it a crowd pain makes it a crowd unforgiveness makes it a crowd funny feelings makes it a crowd formality makes it a crowd they can't fit on the road and i'm not falling off the cliff they're getting off amen hallelujah because it's because me and jesus walking no one else is welcome i'm talking about spirits hey come on with you know what i mean because it's because remember christianity is an individual walk when we stand before the lord either before the judgment seat of christ you receive rewards or we are at the white throne judgment being judged and i pray with all my heart none of us are in that category it's not going to be me and say my wife there it's going to be me and god it's not going to even be me and you there when i give an account my own life it'll be me and him that's why that's why it's an individual affair just walk with god he'll see you through hallelujah amen now what i love about i love so much about the scripture you know what i love about the old testament yeah i'm glad the bible's made for boys you know it's made you know it's made for well you know girls but it's made for boys i love the old testament all the all the all the sword fighting and the killing and the wars and the you know sorry maybe i've got a violent streak i know but but i enjoy the heroism of it because it wasn't it wasn't hollywood it wasn't theatrics these are real men these are real men hallelujah and what i love about it now maybe i'll actually get to my title um he cares for those who care and brother brown says and he cares do you care he says if you're ready to confess and repent and believe and accept god cares but you've got to care first you've got to accept what he sent you he so cared for them that they'd be sure that there would be no mistake he vindicated his prophet by a sign of a pillar of fire to let the people see that it wasn't just this man walking along here that it was god right above him he was the one that was leading the way god cares for people who cares god cares for those who care for him amen so so he cares for those who care hallelujah and and i'm sure that's the reason we are here tonight is not because well it's a wednesday and this is what it's in my schedule but but we're here because we care we care for the lord we want to see his word manifested we want to see his word come to pass amen and what i love about those who care is those who care it's an individual that cares it's not a group thing it's only a group thing if the other people care the same as the individual i mean so so brother brown dramatizes moses's parents and amram was the father of moses and he would he was a slave like all the other slaves he was a he was a hebrew like they all were circumcised believer but he had a burden because the word was about to be fulfilled a deliverer is going to come and he was determined if no one else was going to pray he was going to pray because he cared that god's word would be fulfilled in his day and and and his wife johan would say to him you know honey you're all beat up you got beat up like everyone else there and there's you had a real tough day and your slave masters were all mean to you you know you don't need to go up and pray why don't you let someone else pray but he says what if no one else prays amen i'm gonna be the one who prays through and he's and he kept seeking god night after night oh great jehovah god when's the delivery going to come why because he cared amen and god looked down and says this is one that cares for me i'll show my care for him and that deliverer will be birthed right into his house hallelujah amen why because he cared he wasn't waiting for the rest of the church to care he cared first hallelujah and that's why it's an individual thing do you care if you care he cares amen if you care and he cares for you he'll fulfill his promises to you in your life hallelujah and that's what we want to see don't want to see god's word fulfilled amen the woman with the alabaster box cared hallelujah when she saw jesus unwelcome in the feast of simon the pharisee amen with unwashed feet not made welcome and she saw look through the window she cared amen she said it's wrong for him to be left i mean not made welcome in that place and it's the same thing amen when we come to church we should never leave jesus with unwashed feet unwelcome i remember we should give such a worship that lord jesus you are the most welcome person other you're the guest of guests that we want to see in our lives hallelujah and she cared she didn't ask everyone else now what are we going to do about this sisters what are we going to do about this here he is with unwashed feet you know she didn't go excuse me simon the pharisee um you overlooked someone he was overlooked on purpose by the way i mean so so but she cared enough she took all of her earnings and then she bought the best perfume somehow she got through there past the footwash flanking the robo and different ones and got right to his feet and she cared enough she didn't even ask permission she just poured her life out at his feet hallelujah and because she cared he cared though her sins be white as scarlet hallelujah they're all forgiven go and sin no more hallelujah why because she cared now going back to my old testament i love fighting i mean swords and you know i like i mean i was a boy once too you know i love those kind of things anyway heroes and real heroes amen david had three mighty men he had other mighty men but there were three and david would be standing there and he'd be in his cave or his wherever he was he was an outcast that time a future of an israel and and maybe on the horizon he could see bethel here maybe he's up on the hills he saw it down in the valley and he just expressed a desire he said oh if i could just drink of those cool waters from the well of bethlehem again and no doubt you know the scripture doesn't say he just said it to these three but maybe he just there's a whole bunch of them in the camp he just expressed the desire but because those three cared the smallest of a desire from david was a great commandment to them so because they cared they said boys we're going to get him a fresh drink they did not ask all the others are you coming with they didn't ask the rest of the church are you going to come get him are you going to get your king a fresh drink of water amen but they got their swords they got their bucket and they begin to cut through 15 miles of philistines hallelujah why because they cared amen and the devil tries to garrison every promise from us he tries to garrison even the blessings in a church service away from us if he can he'll ward that off that we'll go out the worst way we came in brother even says that the people can leave service in a worser condition than when they came and we never want to fall into that category we want to be better every time we step through these doors every time we open the scripture every time we pray we want to be in a better spiritual condition now i'm not talking about your emotional state i'm talking about your spiritual condition which is two very different things sometimes i mean as i said you can be filled down in the dumps but spiritually he can be hallelujah it is well with my soul that's how we want to be amen today so they took their weapons and they cut through all those philistines because they cared enough that david's desire was a great commandment to them hallelujah and they break through the philistine host and they got him a drink amen and they returned with it hallelujah so they cut through all doubt because we're mighty men too hallelujah those philistines had an expiry date on them they were not willing to let those philistines stand between them and the goal amen if one got in their way he was going to die i don't know maybe they said hey philistines if you don't want to end up like those guys get out of my way devil if you don't want to end up like those other devils get out of my way hallelujah all the other victories that god has given us in the past if you don't want to end up like that get out of my way because i'm coming through hallelujah i mean so they cut through all doubt yeah the devil comes comes along says is that really true yes it's true the bible says it's true he says oh no you can't really have that who said come on the scripture says whosoever will let them come if you've got a willing heart doesn't matter your condition that's what i love about the you know you're the parable of the of the feast is yo yo the king says get the good and the bad hallelujah so i fell in one of those camps that was fine i don't care if i was bad or good i came hallelujah amen so they cut through all doubt they cut through all ill feelings they cut through all and um unforgiveness they cut through all formality i mean because they were determined amen to get get that king a fresh drink harley and noah and if no one else was gonna do the job amen but they decided to do the job amen that's why when we can come to church hallelujah and we can cut through all formality you know you know the devil says oh there'll be half an hour of singing and this and this and this brother will do this this sister will do this this is how and that pastor does this and yeah cut through all that amen hallelujah and then oh well it's going to finish soon and watch for lunch cut through that trouble i mean oh this person did this to me and this spirit's here and this troubles here who cares the tables and the presence of mine enemies hallelujah i mean in the presence of the devil that's where i feast hallelujah at least they cut through everything until they got to the well hallelujah and then brother ram says and why little bethlehem he says who warrior can see the millennium coming can we not see the millennium coming amen what warrior can see this great holy spirit come in the form of jesus christ the literal person of christ to take over stand with me who sees him coming to take over where is he going to take over you and i first amen the kingdom of god is within you hallelujah amen stand by me let's cut a hole through this denominational creed what's a denominational creed adding or taking from the word to make to make god leave the church we can do that with the message some people have and but i've got news for you we're here to see this live that's why we're christians we want to see jesus living hallelujah amen stand with me stand by me let's cut a hole through this denominational creed let's get in there he's crying for a good fresh drink of pentecostal water original pentecost not a bunch of carrying on screaming hollering here i mean a genuine holy spirit baptism that produces the life of christ back into the person hallelujah so we can cut through you just think about the atmosphere one of us could make hallelujah where we can so move the heart of god that just like blind bartimaeus jesus stands still and says what do my children need in that place right now holy you can produce an atmosphere around you that god you know the angels stand and they watch us worship because they can't join into our worship because they've never been redeemed they've never been lost i'm talking about the ones who haven't fallen and there's no blood for them they can never be redeemed so we talk about i am reading i you know by the blood of the lamb and they could maybe sing it from here but never from here because they've never experienced that hallelujah so so they can watch us worship and no doubt they get excited by that in some form but then god says no no i can't just watch it i want to step into that worship hallelujah because god inhabits the praises of his people i mean so when we begin to praise god irrespective of how we feel and the day and the year and the decade we may have had but we come into the house of god and give them praise and then god says i'm i'm not just going to watch that amen i'm going to step into that worship and then when god comes amen that's when the battles won that's when the victory is won i mean when he comes good things always happen i believe he's present tonight don't you hallelujah amen so they cut through all these things he says this isn't why little bethlehem as well so just think of the potential you're we're a powerhouse one one man is a majority with god one man or one woman they're a majority we don't need a whole bunch just one moses was one john the baptist was one jesus was one hallelujah amen elijah was one one is the majority you know i love it you know you think about i like to dramatize things but you just think about you know gehazi takes the milk bottles brother ram says out to the front gate and he doesn't know that in the night time all that rustling outside was actually the assyrians and camping around the city and you know he goes to put the milk balls out and he looks up and he just starts shaking in his boots and he runs back now this is just me this is probably totally out of it but you know he runs back to elisha shakes him in bed elisha wake up wake up we're going to die you know i think elisha just what you know we're surrounded by the armies of syrians no this is not how does in the scripture but it's just me and maybe just prayed lord open his eyes rolls back to bed you know and then he sees it that that because elisha and gehazi cared god kid and because they cared the armies of heaven were camped around them hallelujah hallelujah so we don't need to worry about anything but you think about how there's that there's there's the prophet all the armies are around that prophet he moves here the armies move he goes here the armies move hallelujah we go here the armies of heaven move and we go over here the armies of heaven move well because god is god is with us and he's waiting for us to call him on the scene i mean because he's not a god of history he's god of the present but he's looking for people to call them into action you know from a god out of history as a god into action hallelujah amen amen hallelujah i'll just read this quote and then and then the music the musicians can you please come he says forgive me if i hurt you no don't you do it i'm doing this in the name of the lord jesus come back stand you gallant men who see david standing you under jesus christ a future from his church bought out by their creeds there's a fresh fountain hanging onto amen there's a power to make this world live again hallelujah i mean it's prophesied in this day to come to pass god said it would come to pass it's got to come to pass you'll never do it in the army you're in now you'll garrison yourself pentecost right around with the rest of the organizations cutting it into a creed so if the devil's pushed us off the line that's the wrong army we're going to be in this army and this is the army we're born to be in amen now oh men of god where's that sword our lord desires a fresh drink i don't care if it's life or death let's cut through this thing it's so hard standing by yourself i'm calling for men to stand by me stand with the word what that word says do it just the way the word said i don't care what any any anything else says stay with it that way for that's the only thing that will cut i mean let's go to bethlehem the true water of god if a man abided me an eye on him if you abided me in my words and you're abiding not just jumping from place to place and swapping your fellowship card from oneness to tunis and threeness and back to a presbyterian lutheran i you abide in me and he is the word my words abide in you don't be afraid of 800 or 8 million i'll stand by your side i desire to drink from that well again god's got to have a people that will drink from that well hallelujah you may think i'm crazy maybe i am then i'm crazy about jesus christ and his word if i have to be called a full let me be cool to fall for his word i have never been against the men in them organizations i'm against that system that's bowing the word of god out let's cut warriors stand by us let's go into that well here is our bethlehem hallelujah hallelujah amen mighty gentile warriors we can cut through anything the devil puts in our path with the word of god we don't have to let it stay between us and the blessing we can cut through every promise i mean cut through to every promise rather hallelujah he cares do you care cast all your distractions upon him because he cares for you everything the devil has done and tries to do it's a distraction so take it cast it upon the lord because he cares for you amen can we have the musicians tonight please our god lives hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen do we know that song i don't know if i do i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i have no idea what key it should be in but doesn't matter who knows that song i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in the army i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in the army if i live let me live in the army of the lord if i live let me live in the army i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in the army hallelujah we had to get the words for that amen hey remember we're in the army of the lord have we got the best equipment have we got the ability god-given ability to wield the sword hallelujah only glad he's called you to the feast thank you lord hallelujah amen i want to sing that song i lift my hands to the coming king don't you see him coming into power hallelujah amen amen what key shall we have amen will god then i lift my hands to the coming king to the great i am to you i see for you're the one who reigns within my heart let's do that verse again i lift my hands to the coming king to the great i am to you i sing you are the one who reigns within my heart
