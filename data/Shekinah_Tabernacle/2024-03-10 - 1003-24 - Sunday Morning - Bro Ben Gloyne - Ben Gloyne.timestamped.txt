[35:29] after the way which they call heresy so
[35:32] worship I the god of my fathers
[35:34] believing all things which are written
[35:37] in the law and in the prophets and have
[35:39] hope toward God which they themselves
[35:42] also allow that there shall be a
[35:44] resurrection of the Dead both of the
[35:46] just and the unjust and here and do I
[35:48] exercise myself to have always a

[36:59] what we believe uh because I've I've
[37:01] heard descriptions of um if I can just
[37:03] find my little Post-It note here I you
[37:06] I've heard descriptions about how people
[37:08] try and describe us of being between
[37:10] Baptists and Pentecostals and I thought
[37:12] that is the most dis disservice you
[37:14] could ever do to describe a Believer
[37:16] because we believe the whole word of God
[37:18] I me we don't believe just a partial
[37:20] piece of of the word and a bit of creed
[37:22] mixed in now we believe the whole Bible
[37:23] and the cover also from ker to ker and
[37:26] the also cuz the ker says holy Bible and
[37:29] we believe it's the word of God so the
[37:31] Apostle Paul will be standing here he's
[37:33] he's been called into question about
[37:35] what he believes as we know wherever God
[37:37] manifests himself there's always a bunch
[37:39] of trouble amen it's always been I want
[37:42] to kind of title this the trail of the
[37:43] pillar of fire Through the Ages amen
[37:46] because it's wherever God is and where
[37:48] where where man sees God manifest his
[37:50] word that that's where you want to be
[37:52] amen because just believing in a
[37:54] historical fact of Jesus resurrected
[37:57] from the dead it's not enough am
[37:58] historians can acknowledge that you've
[38:00] got to believe his word in the season
[38:02] that you live amen because you believe
[38:05] what he's done in your day it'll connect
[38:06] you back to the sacrifice of Calvary am
[38:09] mean because multitudes believe that
[38:10] Jesus died and rose again but there's no
[38:12] transformation of their life I mean
[38:14] they're still living in sin and
[38:15] religious people but we're not called to
[38:16] live in sin and be religious people
[38:18] we're called to be made in the image of
[38:20] his word amen the new birth is a
[38:21] definite experience you must experience
[38:24] I mean we're not here just to grow into
[38:26] something here to be changed amen that
[38:28] our old nature is dead and buried that
[38:30] old man is dead amen he's dead and gone
[38:32] he never lives again but Christ lives in
[38:34] you and I am me that's what the power of
[38:36] the blood does amen that's why Jesus
[38:38] died not just that we' become Christians
[38:41] or message Believers but his life would
[38:43] come and live in US am mean more than a
[38:45] tag more than a church but a god living
[38:48] in people once again amen see the
[38:50] Apostle Paul was standing here he says
[38:51] in the way they call heresy am mean so a
[38:54] lot of people called it heresy but who's
[38:55] the they the religious people of the day
[38:58] amen the scribes and the Pharisees and
[39:00] you know reading just from scoffield
[39:02] would say that you know when they when
[39:04] when Israel was carried into Babylon
[39:06] they had the before that they had the
[39:07] temple they had one basically levitical
[39:10] priesthood all those things but when
[39:11] they came out of Babylon they had the
[39:13] they had the um synagogue they had the
[39:15] scribes the Pharisees the Sadducees they
[39:17] had all different kind of sex and that's
[39:19] what happens when people come out of the
[39:21] world they bring a lot of religion of
[39:22] the world with them but the thing is it
[39:24] wasn't a controversy if you're a in
[39:26] Jesus day that would be fine yeah that's
[39:28] right no one called you a heretic if
[39:30] you're a sadducee well you're sad but
[39:32] hey that's still fine but you know that
[39:35] wasn't controversial if you're a scribe
[39:36] or a herodian whatever more because
[39:38] those things became the accepted
[39:40] Orthodox practice of the day but the
[39:43] thing is if you compared it to the word
[39:44] of God it was heresy amen because God
[39:48] promised Israel if they walk with him
[39:50] they will dwell in peace in their land
[39:52] they will not be occupied they won't be
[39:54] in bondage to any other Nation but they
[39:56] will occupy possess their Promised Land
[39:59] but you see the the church in that day
[40:01] had gotten so to a bad slump that they
[40:03] weren't even talking like Gideon did in
[40:05] the Old Testament saying if God is for
[40:07] us we're the Miracles where is that
[40:09] Supernatural God that once lived amen
[40:10] they didn't even ask those questions no
[40:12] more but they had gone into such a slump
[40:14] of just fussing and fighting and arguing
[40:16] about who's right who's wrong and we
[40:18] believe this and they don't believe that
[40:20] and I say sadly a lot of Christians get
[40:22] into that kind of a framework of what's
[40:24] your Doctrine here's my Doctrine my is
[40:26] right your doctrine's wrong no it's not
[40:28] this is not what Christianity is about
[40:30] it's a life amen it's a life of the Holy
[40:32] Ghost it's the word of God putting on
[40:34] flesh and and you and I amen because
[40:36] it's very easy just to list a bunch of
[40:38] dogmas but hey we're got to go beyond
[40:40] that amen see praise the Lord I'm just
[40:43] trying to maybe slow down a bit you know
[40:45] but see we don't just follow a uh you
[40:47] know the message is not long hair long
[40:49] faces long skirts and that's it you know
[40:52] it's more than just well there's one God
[40:54] and you get baptized in the name of
[40:56] Jesus Jesus Christ you got to address a
[40:57] certain way we are not just some kind of
[40:59] Pentecostal church that has Holiness
[41:02] we're not just where the gifts are the
[41:03] Apex of our existence no it's God the
[41:06] fullness of the word putting on flesh in
[41:08] you and I I mean it's more than an
[41:10] argument more than a more than just a
[41:12] well with just a progressed moved on
[41:14] kind of a movement that's come out of a
[41:16] denomination we're more than that
[41:18] because brother Ram says the second
[41:20] crucifixion of the word is happening in
[41:22] this day and it's not just the
[41:23] denominations but it's the independence
[41:26] I mean many of them kill the influence
[41:28] of the word that the word cannot have
[41:29] effect because if you think about it the
[41:31] effect of the word is people who are
[41:33] filled with the holy ghost walking
[41:35] according to the word loving the Lord
[41:37] above everything amen that's what that's
[41:39] what Calvary was meant to achieve that's
[41:41] why Jesus died that he would that you
[41:43] would be emptied of yourself he would
[41:45] fill you with his with his presence amen
[41:47] and his word would put on flesh in you
[41:49] and I that when you walk down the Bible
[41:52] the I mean walk down the road the
[41:53] Bible's walking down the road and mean
[41:55] when you go to your work go to your
[41:56] school it's the Bible stepping in there
[41:58] in flesh amen more than just memorizing
[42:01] verses but it lives in you and I amen so
[42:04] this is this is but you see people kill
[42:07] the effect of the word and it's not just
[42:09] in denomination or independent churches
[42:11] and many Mist churches as well where
[42:13] they quench the spirit they don't let
[42:15] God live because they have an idea of
[42:17] how it should be and that's it they
[42:19] don't let God live and I think we should
[42:21] let God live more than ever before the
[42:23] devil's living more than ever before and
[42:25] God should live more than ever before
[42:27] amen where we allow God to change us we
[42:30] actually are willing to surrender our
[42:32] thoughts our Ambitions our hopes our
[42:34] plans what we think we should be put it
[42:36] on his Altar and let him live amen so
[42:40] we're living in a day of the second
[42:41] crucifixtion of Jesus Christ but we're
[42:43] not here to and and brother Bram tells
[42:45] us in the indictment that the places
[42:47] where he gets his wounds is from pulpits
[42:49] amen where man will stand and just fuss
[42:51] and fight and stew but there's no life
[42:53] we need the life of God I'll get to my
[42:55] text soon but you know we need the life
[42:57] of God more than ever we need his word
[42:59] to have right away am mean God has been
[43:02] searching down Through the Ages with for
[43:04] that people would allow him to be king
[43:07] of their lives amen see they were he was
[43:09] king of Adam and Eve but then the fall
[43:12] happened and then now there's been a
[43:13] there's been a wrestling match between
[43:15] man's Fallen nature and God or what
[43:18] about the devil well the devil's in
[43:20] there too but really the devil got
[43:21] defeated that down Calvary doesn't have
[43:23] the keys to his own house the singer of
[43:25] death was p out every evil spirit has
[43:28] been conquered so what's the problem you
[43:30] and I human nature self is the problem
[43:34] amen self is the thing that gets man in
[43:36] trouble self is actually causing man to
[43:38] cause a nuclear war to happen
[43:41] amen if we can to get self out of the
[43:43] way God can do what he wants to do amen
[43:45] but you see the problem always is is
[43:47] when man mixes scriptures and quotes
[43:49] them with their own selfish Ambitions
[43:51] and me you see this is what happened
[43:53] here with the the Apostle Paul the
[43:55] people people that called his way heresy
[43:57] they were mixing scriptures they said to
[43:59] even Jesus we have Moses we're moses'
[44:02] disciples but he said to them if you
[44:04] really believe Moses you would have
[44:05] believed me cuz Moses wrote Of Me amen
[44:09] so they they could point back to
[44:10] historical God but they had forgotten
[44:12] what the very Promises of God that were
[44:14] meant to be manifested in their day and
[44:16] when the word became flesh they wanted
[44:20] to crucify him because we understand
[44:22] that God is his word it's very simple
[44:25] but it's so important that God is his
[44:27] word and we've been taught by the
[44:29] prophet Messenger to get away from God
[44:31] Is by getting away from his word it's
[44:33] that simple amen so if you put your
[44:35] ideas above the the word of God you've
[44:38] stepped away from God because in the
[44:40] beginning was the word and the Word was
[44:42] with God and the Word was God and the
[44:45] same was in the beginning with God all
[44:46] things were made by him and without him
[44:48] was not anything made that was made and
[44:50] in him was life and the life was the
[44:52] light of men so God is his word amen and
[44:56] we are not called just to believe part
[44:58] of his word but all of his word amen
[45:01] I've never seen a a wedding take place
[45:04] where a where a where a bride marries
[45:06] just an arm of a bridegroom yeah I've
[45:09] never seen a part of a person be married
[45:11] to a complete person who's ever seen
[45:13] that no one's ever seen that have you
[45:15] but you see this is what people will do
[45:16] is they will take part of the word that
[45:18] they like and they will disregard the
[45:20] things they don't want and they'll say
[45:22] well I'm a Christian because I believe
[45:24] this part we're going to take the whole
[45:25] word of God amen we can't just take part
[45:27] of it but you see now there's always
[45:29] been down Through the Ages there's
[45:31] always been a trail of when God
[45:33] manifests himself and that is where
[45:36] people they have to receive him or
[45:38] reject him Moses Moses could have um you
[45:42] know by the time Moses came on the scene
[45:45] Abraham had already come and you know
[45:47] they could have discussed what
[45:48] everything that God did in Abraham's
[45:50] life and that was all perfectly fine
[45:51] they could have talked about what Noah
[45:53] did that's all perfectly fine but you
[45:55] see when God came down and spoke to
[45:57] Moses now this was a different season
[46:00] see all that God did was perfectly fine
[46:02] but the thing is you've got to look at
[46:04] your attitude now towards the word of
[46:06] God what your attitude now is towards
[46:08] the word of God is what your attitude
[46:10] would have been then amen so when when
[46:13] God came down there and spoke to Moses
[46:15] now you know there were some people who
[46:17] stayed in Egypt there were some people
[46:19] who just explained the Miracles away
[46:21] there's some people whose Hearts just
[46:23] got hardened and so what that attitude
[46:25] was back then is what you'd have that
[46:27] same attitude now cuz it's very easy to
[46:29] say I would have been on the ark with
[46:31] Noah I would have been the ninth guy on
[46:33] right come on but what's your attitude
[46:35] now see because your attitude now is
[46:37] what your attitude would have been back
[46:38] then cuz that was Christ being
[46:40] manifested amen it was a man building an
[46:43] ark for the Salvation of the world but
[46:44] that was the word being made flesh am
[46:47] mean so that was where God was it's you
[46:49] know they could have maybe maybe there
[46:51] would have been people there for for
[46:52] that 120 years that Noah was building
[46:54] the ark they could have been discussing
[46:56] what it was like in the garden and what
[46:58] Adam and Eve would have done and Enoch
[46:59] being raptured and all these things but
[47:01] that didn't help them if they didn't get
[47:02] in the ark that's right see it's very
[47:04] easy to say well Jesus died 2,000 years
[47:06] ago rose rose again but what are you
[47:07] doing with him now what are you allowing
[47:09] him to do in your life now you see so
[47:11] it's not just a historical you know yes
[47:15] it happened but what's it done to you
[47:17] what's his word what is he doing today
[47:19] in your life you see so it says here by
[47:23] faith Moses when he came to years
[47:25] refused to be son of Pharaoh's daughter
[47:27] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[47:29] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[47:31] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[47:33] their approach of Christ greater riches
[47:36] than the treasures in Egypt so Moses
[47:38] followed Christ you say that was God in
[47:41] a burning bush yeah but that was Christ
[47:43] in the burning bush that was God
[47:45] manifesting himself speaking to Moses he
[47:48] says I have heard the cries of my people
[47:50] Exodus chapter 3 and I have come down to
[47:52] deliver them behold I'm sending you to
[47:54] do the job so in other words God came
[47:56] down commission Moses stepped into Moses
[47:59] and went into Pharaoh Pharaoh's court
[48:01] because when Moses would say to Pharaoh
[48:03] let my people go they weren't moses'
[48:06] people they were God's people that was
[48:08] God speaking through Moses so when you
[48:10] saw that 8year old man with a stick and
[48:12] his brother there Aaron walking down
[48:15] into Pharaoh's Palace there that was the
[48:17] manifestation of the word for that day
[48:20] am me that was God putting on flesh
[48:22] manifesting the promise that he gave to
[48:24] Abraham for UND years before so now now
[48:27] we would have to make a decision are we
[48:30] going to listen to this man who just
[48:31] speaks a critical judgment on on the
[48:34] superpower and the world we live in are
[48:35] we going to you know are we going to
[48:38] listen to this man or are we going to
[48:40] stick with the gods of Egypt what are we
[48:42] going to do I mean the we're going to
[48:44] put our I like to put myself in the
[48:46] Bible story who who I like to step back
[48:48] in time and say what would I do if I was
[48:51] there sure there's Supernatural signs
[48:53] and different things happening but you
[48:54] know what would I do would I stay in
[48:57] Egypt or would I follow amen and then
[49:00] when you know when Moses instructs the
[49:02] people that there's going to be the
[49:04] death Angels going to come in the land
[49:06] am I going to kill a lamb you know death
[49:09] is a rough thing it's a horrible thing
[49:12] who's ever seen a a sheep be killed and
[49:15] butchered or a cattle Beast or something
[49:18] it's not a glamorous thing it's not like
[49:21] one minute you know the Beast is killed
[49:23] Nick minute it's in a polis
[49:26] you know thing in the supermarket
[49:27] there's a lot of it's It's a Grizzly
[49:29] thing death is not pretty right and then
[49:32] even the even the children of Israel
[49:34] they told you have to have this Lamb
[49:36] with bitter herbs so humanly humanly
[49:40] it's not really a it's not a sweet thing
[49:43] I've got a sweet tooth oh boy but God
[49:47] instructed them you've got to roast this
[49:49] Lamb with bitter herbs you have to eat
[49:51] it this way it's not a sweet thing for
[49:53] this for this Blood to be applied
[49:55] humanly because there's God's Will and
[49:58] your will both can't be in the same
[50:00] place amen one has to die in order for
[50:02] the other to live a lot of people say
[50:04] yes I'm a Christian but it's their will
[50:06] running around doing their own thing but
[50:08] no it should be we must die and he must
[50:10] live that's what real repentance a real
[50:12] death to self is it's not my will but
[50:14] thy will be done and not my and and it's
[50:17] and it's not my will but thy will be
[50:19] done when it suits me that's right it's
[50:21] all the time amen it's all the time so
[50:23] they had to have it with bitter herbs
[50:25] says eat it not of it raw nor soen at
[50:28] all with water but roast with fire with
[50:30] his head with his legs and with the
[50:32] perance thereof that's the
[50:35] guts that's the bits you don't normally
[50:37] go buy in the
[50:39] supermarket but what he's saying is
[50:41] you've got to offer the whole lamb you
[50:43] to take remember the lamb represented
[50:45] Christ represents the word he is the
[50:47] word so you can't sacrifice part of the
[50:50] word you can't just have the nice parts
[50:52] of the your favorite instagrammable
[50:54] scriptures that you just posted # and
[50:56] this is lovely and love Jesus and peace
[50:58] love and good no no it's it's the whole
[51:00] word you can only apply the blood to
[51:02] your life if you receive the whole word
[51:04] of God and there's not some Knowledge
[51:06] Test you know no you've got to say yes
[51:08] this is all you Lord this is not just me
[51:10] and my ideas mixed in no you got to take
[51:12] the whole word of God see they could not
[51:14] just take part of the Lamb they had to
[51:16] kill the whole thing yeah I mean they
[51:18] had to eat the whole thing they' have it
[51:19] with bitter herbs amen and humanly it's
[51:21] a bitter thing to die or anything's
[51:23] bitter to die I me we got to be willing
[51:25] to to die out to our old nature and let
[51:27] the blood be applied I mean and not just
[51:29] eat the nice spits but with the guts and
[51:31] everything on the
[51:33] inside the whole word of God you see how
[51:36] can the blood be applied if you if you
[51:39] don't receive the whole word of God
[51:41] where you come across one thing and the
[51:42] spirit in you says no I can't do that
[51:45] that's for another age that's the wrong
[51:46] idea you no the blood's not applied then
[51:50] amen but if the blood has being applied
[51:51] well what are you talking about the
[51:52] blood being applied well you know the
[51:54] blood's been applied you if the baptism
[51:56] of the Holy Ghost has comeing if God
[51:57] himself has stepped inside amen because
[52:00] the life and the blood is what's the
[52:01] most important thing see we could have a
[52:04] genuine vile of certified blood of Jesus
[52:06] Christ that would be an incredible thing
[52:09] to have but it's but now don't get me
[52:11] wrong but just having that blood
[52:13] physically is not going to take me in a
[52:14] Rapture it's the life and that blood's
[52:17] got to come into me change me amen and
[52:20] then what happened now I'm now New
[52:21] Creation in Christ Jesus now I'm ready
[52:24] for the Rapture right so just to
[52:25] physically have his blood like the
[52:27] Catholics have I don't know how many
[52:28] nails they have you know it's like
[52:30] having a piece of uh you know the den
[52:32] room of brother Bram or some some some
[52:34] Relic from Jeffersonville that's not
[52:35] going to help you none I mean no you got
[52:37] to have the life that was in the Holy
[52:39] Ghost and the prophets got to come into
[52:40] you amen you know seeing those things
[52:43] I'm not too interested if you've gone
[52:45] I'm I'm glad you went but it's not on my
[52:47] bucket list to see those places
[52:49] personally I'd rather go to the on the
[52:52] mission field someone who really needs
[52:53] God I'd rather go somewhere like thaten
[52:56] but hey if you want to go go okay I'm
[52:58] not I'm not saying it's a bad thing you
[52:59] want to go see it go for it enjoy take
[53:01] photos tell me how it was but personally
[53:03] that's not going to help me because I've
[53:05] met the God who sent the message I mean
[53:07] I've met that Pillar of Fire I've met
[53:09] the mighty Angel himself I mean I don't
[53:11] need to know everything about the
[53:12] prophet to be a believer I've met the
[53:14] word himself and that's the main thing
[53:16] that you meet the word don't be caught
[53:17] up in his life story only no receive the
[53:20] Revelation that he
[53:22] broughten amen I'm not angry okay if if
[53:26] I say I'm not angry I'm just passionate
[53:28] hey I've been in places where people are
[53:30] way more passionate than this I've been
[53:32] down to Chile and man in church they're
[53:34] like it's like a football game but it's
[53:35] an eternal thing amen and they're all
[53:38] their heart soul and mind is in it why
[53:40] because Jesus has redeem them they're
[53:41] happy and I'm I'm the same way I'm sorry
[53:44] I'm just glad that he found me he
[53:46] redeemed me he washed me am mean so we
[53:48] want to contend for the faith that wants
[53:50] delivered to the Saints why because we
[53:51] want to see God live like never before
[53:53] you know my heart's desire desire is the
[53:56] day of the Rapture this place is
[53:58] empty where people start searching where
[54:02] where' they go and we're gone we're all
[54:04] gone there's no one turning up here
[54:06] looking for church and most of us aren't
[54:08] here that's my heartest desire we all go
[54:11] as one big Ransom group amen so let's
[54:13] not be caught up in the lukewarm Spirit
[54:15] of the age amen let's be on fire for God
[54:17] am mean to realize we don't serve a
[54:19] system we don't serve a denomination we
[54:22] don't serve even Jeffersonville or some
[54:24] list of beliefs we serve Jesus Christ
[54:27] the revealed word amen so so you'd have
[54:30] to decide what would you do would you
[54:32] would you listen to this 80-year old man
[54:33] with a stick in his hand and you know
[54:36] and say yes that's Christ sir and then
[54:38] you would follow him and then You' come
[54:40] to Mount Sinai now what would you do if
[54:42] you um one of the 12 Spies and you
[54:44] weren't Caleb with
[54:46] Joshua if there were 13 spies and I was
[54:49] one of them there would have been three
[54:51] giving a good report Caleb Joshua and me
[54:54] why because I believe his word today my
[54:56] attitude today is it would have been the
[54:57] same back then amen so if I wasn't one
[55:00] of the spies but yet they came in then
[55:02] the other 10 were you know giving an
[55:04] evil report there would have been a
[55:05] scripture injected into the scripture
[55:07] but being of the tribe of whoever said
[55:09] no we're more than able to take the land
[55:11] don't listen to these 10 they're lying
[55:13] to you am mean God has revealed himself
[55:15] he's true this is not Moses is doing
[55:17] this is not you know Aaron's doing this
[55:19] is God's doing amen God is fulfilling
[55:21] his word can you not see it people can
[55:23] you not see this is the fulfillment of a
[55:25] prophecy given to Abraham amen and this
[55:28] should be the same thing with you and I
[55:29] today can you not see this messages
[55:31] Jesus Christ revealed it is the son of
[55:33] man revealed it's not even a healing M
[55:35] Ministry only not a prophetic Ministry
[55:37] only it is God himself being made known
[55:41] amen so it goes beyond an argument we're
[55:43] not here to follow just some Bible
[55:44] school or no we're here to follow the
[55:47] whole word of God Amen like Paul would
[55:49] say that he he said he believes where
[55:53] are
[55:54] we believing all things which are
[55:56] written by in the law and all the
[55:58] prophets he was called crazy cuz he
[56:00] believed the whole Bible I'm just
[56:02] bringing today's language you say they
[56:05] they think I'm off my I've gone off on
[56:06] the deep end because I just believe the
[56:08] whole Bible I don't believe part of it I
[56:10] believe from ker to ker and the ker also
[56:12] I believe the whole thing this is why
[56:14] this is why they're calling it heresy
[56:16] and the Apostle Paul what he did is he
[56:18] actually because in those days the
[56:19] scribes and the Pharisees they injected
[56:22] tons of laws on man-made laws into the
[56:25] word of God and so and that was
[56:28] considered Orthodox ways right to mix
[56:31] man's ideas oh what they call it midrash
[56:35] midrash it be as human sayings it
[56:37] becomes scripture and I think it sounds
[56:39] like some physical midrash you need some
[56:41] cream to get rid of that midrash you
[56:43] know it sounds like a real bad thing to
[56:45] have but that's what they were suffering
[56:46] from midrash amen but you see the
[56:49] Apostle Paul came along and said no the
[56:51] Bible is the infallible word of God we
[56:53] don't need man's idea we don't need
[56:55] man's Creeds all we need is the word of
[56:57] God and that is the same thing that is
[56:59] what we believe amen that God has taken
[57:02] away all the
[57:03] midrash hallelujah amen through through
[57:06] a Channel of Malachi 4 he has taken away
[57:08] all the midrash he's tied up all the
[57:10] loose ends of the scripture people were
[57:12] debating about different things and
[57:13] those things have all been restored amen
[57:15] so that's why we say we believe the
[57:17] Bible it is our absolute amen and not
[57:20] because we and and and and the reason we
[57:23] can say that is not because we just say
[57:25] well we just don't are not
[57:26] denominational no because God through a
[57:28] Channel of Malachi 4 has restored the
[57:31] word of God look you can see now the
[57:33] Elijah when he came the first time
[57:35] Elijah himself on Mount carel it says
[57:37] that He restored the altar of the Lord
[57:39] that had fallen down so that worship
[57:41] approach to God had fallen down and what
[57:44] happened God inspired Elijah you going
[57:46] to rebuild this altar I mean because
[57:48] they have to see my fire come down and
[57:50] consume the sacrifice so he didn't build
[57:52] a new he didn't build a new altar he
[57:54] Resto the altar that was already there
[57:56] and I say there have been Revelation
[57:57] stones that have been neglected am mean
[58:00] simple things like being baptized in the
[58:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ God being
[58:04] one spirit manifested in different ways
[58:06] different different Revelations that
[58:08] have been neglected Through the Ages
[58:09] what God inspired brother Brown that you
[58:12] know prophet of Malachi 4 what to
[58:14] restore the approach to God so now it's
[58:17] not just an anointing of gifts but it's
[58:19] gifts and The Giver me it's the giver on
[58:21] the inside it's that true Pentecost fire
[58:24] comes down that God dwells on the inside
[58:26] so now the spirit within the believer
[58:28] copes with the word of God that it's not
[58:30] us fighting the word no it's us saying
[58:32] yes Lord amen to the word of God and
[58:34] that's the biggest sign you have the
[58:36] Holy Ghost is you will put the word of
[58:38] God above your own opinion am mean
[58:39] you'll put it above the Fashions of the
[58:41] world you put it above the culture of
[58:42] the world you'll put the word above all
[58:44] those things amen sorry I don't have a
[58:46] first gear I'm just going this fast okay
[58:49] but you see you've got to realize it if
[58:50] you if the spirit within you can't cope
[58:52] with the word of God you get rid of that
[58:54] spirit you say God take that religious
[58:56] spirit out of me and give me the holy
[58:58] ghosten if you cannot cope with the
[59:00] simple things of the Bible cuz remember
[59:02] brother Bram said you know because they
[59:04] wanted to say teach us algebra that we
[59:06] can you
[59:07] know have deep spiritual things he says
[59:10] how can you know algebra if you won't
[59:12] have your ABCs and ABCs has always
[59:15] believe Christ and Christ is his word
[59:18] amen amen praise the Lord so there was
[59:22] there would been that challenge that day
[59:23] amen even in down through the Bible when
[59:25] the prophets came there'd be a challenge
[59:27] can you accept that Prophet when he came
[59:30] amen and so your attitude now will be
[59:32] your attitude then see there's always
[59:34] been people down through the scripture
[59:36] that've been bitterly opposed to the
[59:37] move of God they've been on fire for the
[59:40] move of God and they've been indifferent
[59:43] yeah that's right which one are you
[59:44] today I trust you're the on fire for the
[59:47] word of God category oh yeah amen not
[59:49] the Bly opposer not the indifferent amen
[59:51] if you feel indifferent that's a spirit
[59:53] making you indifferent amen I'd say
[59:55] Satan get away from me in the name of
[59:56] Jesus Christ I'm not made to be
[59:58] indifferent I'm made to be on fire amen
[1:00:00] I'm made to be passionate I'm made to be
[1:00:02] happy and rejoice Amen in the god of our
[1:00:04] Salvation so you see so Moses Moses
[1:00:07] followed Christ out of Egypt and then
[1:00:09] Joshua that same God changed form as the
[1:00:12] captain of the host of the Lord and then
[1:00:13] he took over where where Moses left off
[1:00:16] amen because God told Joshua my servant
[1:00:19] Moses is dead take ye therefore these
[1:00:21] people and go over the river Jordan into
[1:00:23] the inheritance right
[1:00:25] amen so so God would come down through
[1:00:27] many different ways then then now you
[1:00:29] you we skip Way Forward down to King
[1:00:31] David's time he was a man he was on the
[1:00:34] run from King Saul he had a few
[1:00:36] Supernatural testimonies but the
[1:00:38] challenge would be would you rally to
[1:00:40] David or would you stay with
[1:00:41] denominational King Saul that all he did
[1:00:44] was sit there and criticize what God was
[1:00:45] doing who would you gather to because we
[1:00:48] know C A David was a manifestation of
[1:00:51] the word I mean cuz even Moses I believe
[1:00:54] said that that you'll have Kings one day
[1:00:57] amen so he was actually a manifestation
[1:00:59] of the word because remember when Samuel
[1:01:02] anointed David amen it said the spirit
[1:01:04] of God was with him from that day on so
[1:01:06] now you would have to look at this man
[1:01:07] who is a renegade he is on the run from
[1:01:09] his own people and you would have to
[1:01:11] look and say is this God or is this
[1:01:13] not your attitude today would be the
[1:01:16] same thing because if you really know
[1:01:17] God today you would have been one of the
[1:01:19] Mighty Men am mean you would have
[1:01:20] gathered to him when he was on the run
[1:01:22] you say you're my King David amen you're
[1:01:23] coming into power Hallelujah that that's
[1:01:26] what you do amen when he cried out I
[1:01:28] want to drink from The Well of Bethlehem
[1:01:30] there wouldn't have been three mighty
[1:01:31] mean there would have been four you
[1:01:32] would have been the fourth man amen or
[1:01:34] the fourth woman saying let's go get our
[1:01:35] captain a drink am mean cuz his greatest
[1:01:38] desire became a the least of his desires
[1:01:40] became a great commandment to them amen
[1:01:43] so he didn't even say give me a drink he
[1:01:44] just longed for a drink amen and they
[1:01:46] took it as a commandment and they fought
[1:01:48] their way through those Philistines to
[1:01:49] get that drink why because their
[1:01:51] attitude was this man has been anointed
[1:01:54] by God this man amen has been ordained
[1:01:57] by God to sit on the throne and and
[1:01:59] totally occupy the promised land amen so
[1:02:01] we're going to gather to them gathered
[1:02:03] to him and the sign they gathered is the
[1:02:05] same anointing on David Came Upon them I
[1:02:07] mean because David killed a lion and a
[1:02:09] bear and Goliath did many mighty
[1:02:11] exploits and those Mighty Men did the
[1:02:12] same things they killed Goliath's
[1:02:14] Brothers they killed those giants they
[1:02:16] did Mighty things why because the
[1:02:17] anointing on David Came Upon them amen
[1:02:20] so that's a sign that you really really
[1:02:22] believe this word is because the
[1:02:23] anointing on the anointing on the Lord
[1:02:25] Jesus the anointing on the apostles the
[1:02:27] anointing on the prophet comes upon you
[1:02:29] and you do great exploits in this end
[1:02:30] time hallelujah amen I trust that's you
[1:02:34] today this is what we believe amen we
[1:02:36] don't just believe in a historical God
[1:02:38] many people can point to a founder of
[1:02:39] some movement say yeah back then but not
[1:02:41] today that's a lie amen we shouldn't
[1:02:43] just look at a Founder we say yes he's
[1:02:44] still the same God's still the same
[1:02:46] today am mean he hasn't changed one
[1:02:49] bit Hallelujah so that would have been a
[1:02:52] great challenge in that day amen but
[1:02:55] what about you today amen you see
[1:02:57] there's always been prise the Lord Jesus
[1:03:00] would be would ask his disciples when
[1:03:02] they came to the coast of Cera Philippi
[1:03:05] asked his disciples saying whom do men
[1:03:07] say that I the son of man am and they
[1:03:10] said some say thou art John the Baptist
[1:03:12] some say Elias others Jeremiah or one of
[1:03:15] the
[1:03:16] prophets now the reason they could say
[1:03:19] this is because what they read about
[1:03:20] those prophets doing they saw Jesus do
[1:03:23] and we know the prophet were a portion
[1:03:26] of God expressed but when Jesus came the
[1:03:29] fullness of the godhe bodily dwelt in
[1:03:31] him so it's like if you take white light
[1:03:33] you put it through a prison it becomes a
[1:03:35] rainbow right so each of those different
[1:03:37] colors are a portion of that white light
[1:03:40] God is the white light but he but he put
[1:03:42] a portion of himself down Through the
[1:03:44] Ages down through the prophets right but
[1:03:46] then he wasn't just a portion in Jesus
[1:03:48] no that was God made flesh that was
[1:03:50] Emanuel that was the word made flesh and
[1:03:52] dwelt Among Us so all that God was he
[1:03:54] poured into Christ so that's why they
[1:03:56] could say well you're one of the
[1:03:57] prophets because this is what we see but
[1:03:59] then he asked the question but whom do
[1:04:02] you say that I am this is such an
[1:04:04] important question because this question
[1:04:06] is actually asked to every believer down
[1:04:07] Through the Ages who do you say this is
[1:04:10] amen as we looked at Noah very briefly
[1:04:13] and Moses and David and you know all the
[1:04:15] you Joshua different prophets down
[1:04:17] through you could ask the same question
[1:04:18] who do you say this is yeah who is this
[1:04:22] well this is this is Elijah the tshb
[1:04:24] look again who do you say this is well
[1:04:27] this is God revealing himself through a
[1:04:30] prophet who do you say this is well he's
[1:04:32] Moses no look again look Beyond the Veil
[1:04:35] this is the biggest problem is man gets
[1:04:37] so caught up in the humanity that God
[1:04:40] reveals himself through brother Bram
[1:04:42] would say one the hardest thing pardon
[1:04:45] to do is for a mortal to get another
[1:04:47] mortal to believe them one of the
[1:04:49] hardest things to do is actually a man
[1:04:51] to believe another man why because man
[1:04:53] is always looking at carnality and
[1:04:55] humanity and different things we got to
[1:04:57] look Beyond those things so he asked the
[1:04:59] question but who do you say I am see
[1:05:01] this is see they the Jews around thought
[1:05:05] he was a prophet raised from the dead
[1:05:07] but then Simon Peter answered and said
[1:05:09] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:05:11] Living God and Jesus answered said unto
[1:05:13] him blessed art thou Simon by Jonah for
[1:05:15] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[1:05:17] unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:05:19] heaven and I Al and I say also unto thee
[1:05:21] Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll
[1:05:23] build my church
[1:05:24] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[1:05:27] against it now we know that the
[1:05:28] Catholics take these series of
[1:05:30] scriptures and they say well Peter is
[1:05:32] the rock the church is built upon but
[1:05:35] but that's not that's not the discussion
[1:05:36] that's going on the question is all
[1:05:39] about
[1:05:40] Revelation who do men say I am what's
[1:05:42] been revealed to those guys out there
[1:05:44] well you're one of the prophets but
[1:05:46] what's been revealed to you glory amen
[1:05:49] and then and then when Peter says Thou
[1:05:50] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:05:52] Jesus says bless out thou Simon by Jonah
[1:05:54] for flesh and blood is not revealed unto
[1:05:56] thee but my Father which is in heaven so
[1:05:58] in other words Simon Flesh and Blood
[1:06:01] your your mind your top two inches
[1:06:02] didn't work this out I mean people
[1:06:04] didn't work this out and tell you no my
[1:06:06] Father which is in heaven revealed the
[1:06:07] sovereignly to you that you could look
[1:06:09] Beyond this Humanity that I dwell in and
[1:06:12] see deity hallu amen that that that yes
[1:06:15] I am the Christ I'm I'm the same one
[1:06:17] that Moses followed I'm the same one
[1:06:19] that led Joshua I'm the same one that
[1:06:21] Led Led David and and and you know all
[1:06:23] the and all the Believers down through
[1:06:25] you know Ezekiel Saw me as a wheel
[1:06:27] within the wheel and different things
[1:06:29] but yes I am that one but now I've been
[1:06:31] made flesh and see so what is he he was
[1:06:33] the word made flesh and that same
[1:06:36] question is actually posed to you who do
[1:06:39] you say this word is that's right who do
[1:06:42] you say this message is is it is it just
[1:06:45] a Healing
[1:06:46] Ministry is it just a prophetic Ministry
[1:06:50] is it just correct Doctrine or is it
[1:06:53] Jesus Christ revealed is it Christ
[1:06:56] himself revealed because if you really
[1:06:58] realize that we don't have a group of
[1:07:01] like a collection of an argument say
[1:07:02] this is truth no truth is more than just
[1:07:05] I believe this and this and this and
[1:07:07] this and this is why full stop this is
[1:07:08] true and mine is Right compared to yours
[1:07:10] no truth is a person Jesus said I am the
[1:07:14] way the truth and the life amen so truth
[1:07:16] is not just a collection of argument no
[1:07:18] it's a person being revealed amen so
[1:07:20] it's Christ as the truth so when he is
[1:07:22] revealed amen the believer the all the
[1:07:25] Believers is here to say that's him and
[1:07:27] then line up with him rally to him amen
[1:07:30] amen so this is the question you see
[1:07:33] what's being revealed to you I say this
[1:07:35] message is more than healing more than a
[1:07:36] prophetic Ministry more than correct
[1:07:38] Doctrine it is Jesus Christ himself
[1:07:40] being revealed through a prophet amen
[1:07:42] because if you can see Christ in your
[1:07:44] day then you are built upon the rock of
[1:07:47] Revelation amen and then he says that
[1:07:49] Upon This Rock I'll build my church I'll
[1:07:51] build my called out ones Upon This Rock
[1:07:54] of Revelation that's why we should pray
[1:07:56] for Revelation more than ever pray Lord
[1:07:58] Reveal Your Truth to me Reveal Your word
[1:08:00] to me Lord make yourself known to me
[1:08:03] amen that it's not human influence that
[1:08:06] guides me it's you guide me in your word
[1:08:09] amen and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:08:11] Prevail against it amen and we know
[1:08:12] gates are designed to stop access but
[1:08:16] God promised in the Old Testament that
[1:08:17] thy seed shall possess the gates of the
[1:08:19] enemy amen and when the Lord Jesus
[1:08:22] conquered hell death in the grave the of
[1:08:24] the woman possess the gates of the enemy
[1:08:26] and because we come under that same
[1:08:27] blessing what we shall possess the gates
[1:08:29] of our enemy when the enemy tries to
[1:08:31] stop a promise coming to pass no we're
[1:08:33] going to possess that gate I mean when
[1:08:35] he tries to hinder your walk no you're
[1:08:36] going to possess that gate why because
[1:08:38] you're built upon the rock of Revelation
[1:08:40] amen amen if you can see this is Christ
[1:08:42] in your day amen it'll change your whole
[1:08:44] life amen if you can see beyond just a
[1:08:47] kian's voice but hear the voice behind
[1:08:49] the voice it'll change your whole life
[1:08:52] we believe the whole word of God amen
[1:08:54] come on now amen amen hallelujah you see
[1:08:58] even even um Jesus would would would
[1:09:01] speak about
[1:09:02] John and uh Jesus would say ye sent unto
[1:09:05] John he bear witness unto the truth but
[1:09:07] I Reed not testimony from man but these
[1:09:09] things I say that you might be saved he
[1:09:11] was a burning and a Shining Light and
[1:09:13] you are willing for a season to rejoice
[1:09:15] in his light what so so what is light in
[1:09:18] the Scripture it is the word being
[1:09:20] fulfilled so Jesus was saying he was a
[1:09:22] bright and Shining Light why was that
[1:09:24] because he was the voice of one crying
[1:09:25] in the wilderness to prepare you the way
[1:09:27] of the Lord he wasn't a disgruntled
[1:09:30] anti-establishment religious guy that's
[1:09:32] right he was fulfilled prophecy John was
[1:09:36] the Fulfillment of Isaiah 40:3 am mean
[1:09:40] he was the Fulfillment of Malachi 3 and
[1:09:42] Malachi 4 the first part where Malachi 4
[1:09:45] says the first part says he and he'll
[1:09:47] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:09:49] children that's what the angel told his
[1:09:51] his um um his parents there in in Luke
[1:09:54] chapter 1 that would be the that would
[1:09:56] be the reason John was sent to turn the
[1:09:58] hearts from the traditions of the
[1:09:59] fathers the law to turn them to the new
[1:10:02] faith in Jesus Christ so he was a bright
[1:10:05] and Shining Light cuz his life was a
[1:10:07] fulfillment of scripture and that's what
[1:10:10] we follow here we follow the Fulfillment
[1:10:12] of scripture I me we talk about brother
[1:10:15] Bram talk about Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 the
[1:10:17] son of man being revealed the book of
[1:10:19] redemption coming open all that is is
[1:10:21] fulfilled scripture in our day that's
[1:10:23] right it's nothing else amen it's
[1:10:24] fulfilled scripture it's nothing that's
[1:10:26] been added to or injected it is the word
[1:10:29] being fulfilled amen that's why if you
[1:10:31] look at there's always been controversy
[1:10:34] when the word is fulfilled you see the
[1:10:36] Jews were looking for the Messiah it
[1:10:39] wasn't a mystery that you know that that
[1:10:42] a messiah would come and deliver them
[1:10:44] they were all looking for it you see so
[1:10:46] they would have sat around no doubt and
[1:10:48] and debated how he would come and what
[1:10:49] he would do and all these different
[1:10:51] things and sure that probably would have
[1:10:53] ended up just just with a nice debate
[1:10:55] but then when he came and he came the
[1:10:59] way they didn't expect they expected no
[1:11:01] doubt be born in a palace he'd be a
[1:11:03] general he'd be a mighty conqueror amen
[1:11:05] but he was a baby born in a manger amen
[1:11:08] and and he was born in a place that
[1:11:09] though the Bible said he'd be born there
[1:11:11] this you know the religious people
[1:11:12] didn't go and see his birth it was
[1:11:14] humble Shepherds that were that the
[1:11:15] birth was announced to it was wise men
[1:11:17] from afar was different ones but you see
[1:11:20] he was the Fulfillment of the word and
[1:11:22] because he was a fulfillment of the word
[1:11:25] that's why the devil wanted to kill him
[1:11:27] isn't it amazing where where Jesus would
[1:11:29] come in he do a miracle he'd like you a
[1:11:31] man with a withed hand in the synagogue
[1:11:32] would heal them and do things on the
[1:11:34] Sabbath day according to the word of God
[1:11:36] and the more he did the more they wanted
[1:11:38] to destroy him that's right isn't that a
[1:11:40] strange thing I mean you think the more
[1:11:42] he did the more they would have rallied
[1:11:44] yeah amen but you see that religious
[1:11:46] spirit hates the word being fulfilled
[1:11:49] amen they would talk all day long about
[1:11:50] Moses and and Elijah and all the
[1:11:52] prophets of old but but when the God who
[1:11:54] sent those prophets became flesh they
[1:11:56] wanted to destroy him amen that's why
[1:11:58] you know you look in the scripture and
[1:12:00] they wanted to Stone him and throw down
[1:12:01] a cliff and different things but isn't
[1:12:03] it interesting that the disciples were
[1:12:05] there with them yes they weren't trying
[1:12:07] to Stone them but you see they were
[1:12:09] following the word but they hadn't
[1:12:11] become one with that word yet even
[1:12:13] though they were prophesied to be part
[1:12:15] of that word because God said that I'll
[1:12:17] call the people for my name's sake right
[1:12:19] but they are walking with the revealed
[1:12:21] word but because that life wasn't in
[1:12:23] them yet the enemy wasn't trying to
[1:12:26] destroy them you see but then after the
[1:12:28] day of Pentecost is when they dragged
[1:12:30] them in before the Sanhedrin you beat
[1:12:32] them and threaten them and all different
[1:12:33] things why because that same Pillar of
[1:12:35] Fire that was in Jesus Christ now came
[1:12:37] into them in the upper room I mean so
[1:12:39] now the life of God they were the
[1:12:41] Fulfillment of the word for their
[1:12:43] day amen did that what you say does that
[1:12:47] take away from what God just did no it's
[1:12:50] a further fulfillment of what he did
[1:12:52] because remember God God has been
[1:12:54] walking down Through the Ages fulfilling
[1:12:55] his word amen amen down Through the Ages
[1:12:58] the pillar of fire has been moving and
[1:13:00] those have been predestinate see him
[1:13:02] move and they become one with it amen
[1:13:04] you see so that's why I can say we are
[1:13:07] following the Fulfillment of scripture
[1:13:09] amen so John was a bright and Shining
[1:13:11] Light but we couldn't just stand around
[1:13:13] and rejoice that God had sent a
[1:13:15] forerunner that's right amen but we had
[1:13:17] to follow the Messiah that he identified
[1:13:19] amen and brother Brown's Ministry was to
[1:13:21] identify Christ in the scripture I mean
[1:13:23] to introduce us to the Lamb of God once
[1:13:25] again I mean not to introduce us to
[1:13:27] Creeds and opinions of man but to
[1:13:29] introduce us to the word of God Amen so
[1:13:32] just like there acts I believe it's 19
[1:13:34] there were 12 disciples of pooll and
[1:13:36] different ones all they knew was the
[1:13:38] that Christ had come he had given his
[1:13:40] life they were preaching but they didn't
[1:13:41] know the coming of the Holy Ghost they
[1:13:43] weren't even baptized right and they
[1:13:45] were dancing around with what God had
[1:13:46] done in the past but you see the light
[1:13:49] had moved on so when Paul came his way
[1:13:51] he brought them into a further part of
[1:13:52] the word and they received it and they
[1:13:55] received the Holy Ghost that's why we're
[1:13:56] not dancing around God sent a prophet
[1:13:58] that's righten that was in the past God
[1:14:01] sent him do we do away with it no but
[1:14:03] now we say what did he say what did he
[1:14:05] preach what was that Ministry sent for
[1:14:07] and that Ministry was sent to unite a
[1:14:09] people with the word of God am mean that
[1:14:11] we become the word of God made flesh I
[1:14:13] mean that's why now we talk about what
[1:14:14] there's a bride coming of Jesus Christ
[1:14:16] am mean we've been restored back to a
[1:14:18] true Pentecost where God lives in his
[1:14:19] people if I'm going too fast I'm sorry
[1:14:22] I'm just this is just where we're going
[1:14:23] okay but I just want you to really get
[1:14:25] we believe the whole word we believe the
[1:14:28] Bible around here okay we don't have a
[1:14:30] church document of opinions of man and
[1:14:32] writing things no those days are gone
[1:14:34] amen amen no we have seen the pillar of
[1:14:37] fire in this day and we've seen him live
[1:14:39] and we are eyewitnesses of His Majesty
[1:14:41] eyewitnesses of his Mercy we have a
[1:14:44] testimony I'm not just talking about we
[1:14:46] have a testimony that he lives amen that
[1:14:48] he proves his word hallelujah that's why
[1:14:50] we can say we're not just pointing back
[1:14:52] to God in a prophet no we see the god in
[1:14:54] that Prophet alive today amen God didn't
[1:14:57] go off the scene in 1965 no he had to
[1:15:00] take his Prophet off the scene that we
[1:15:01] become one with the word that there's a
[1:15:03] people come on that that are people come
[1:15:05] on the earth and not caught up with the
[1:15:06] prophet anymore it used to be people so
[1:15:09] enamored by Brother Bram and all these
[1:15:10] things no but a people have moved on to
[1:15:13] the word he came to give I mean it be
[1:15:15] like in Jesus's day it would be a bit
[1:15:17] foolish to be caught up with John the
[1:15:18] Baptist when John's already introduced
[1:15:20] you to Jesus don't you think so amen
[1:15:23] should really move with the program and
[1:15:24] walk with the word amen so you see now
[1:15:28] um those disciples who in the book of
[1:15:31] Acts they had to be re-baptized in the
[1:15:33] name of Jesus Christ and they received
[1:15:35] the Holy Ghost amen they begin to walk
[1:15:37] in the light of the day yes praise the
[1:15:40] Lord hallelujah amen
[1:15:43] now but here's the
[1:15:45] thing I said before I mentioned this on
[1:15:47] Wednesday so I thought i' put a picture
[1:15:49] up people love to have an emotional
[1:15:52] connection with a historical Jesus now
[1:15:55] as I say this I'm not doing away with
[1:15:57] the with the cross some people think
[1:15:59] it's one or the other no I believe the
[1:16:01] whole word of God like people in Paul's
[1:16:03] day would say uh no stop quoting Paul
[1:16:07] you need to quote more of the red letter
[1:16:09] of Jesus and they they have no
[1:16:11] understanding that what Paul was
[1:16:12] speaking was the same Christ that was
[1:16:14] speaking the red letter he just changed
[1:16:15] form right so many people are just
[1:16:18] caught up with an emotional idea I've
[1:16:20] seen you know songs on YouTube they have
[1:16:22] clips of passion of the Christ and it's
[1:16:24] it's very moving yeah you get brought to
[1:16:26] tears yeah you know but a lot of that's
[1:16:29] just an emotional connection with a
[1:16:31] picture but then what about now when
[1:16:34] when when people are confronted with the
[1:16:35] word it's very easy to be caught up and
[1:16:38] worthy as the lamb and you see him being
[1:16:39] beaten and mad and it's very emotional
[1:16:42] it it is that's my savior they're
[1:16:45] showing he was mad more than that and he
[1:16:48] was mad for me that makes me emotional
[1:16:50] when I think about what he did for me I
[1:16:51] feel this big Lord I'm So Unworthy but
[1:16:54] you're so good that you do it for me I
[1:16:56] feel I get emotional but you just can't
[1:16:58] be caught up in an emotional attachment
[1:17:00] amen because when you come people's ways
[1:17:02] now this is not very controversial but
[1:17:04] it's very obvious where people say they
[1:17:06] love this the idea of this but they
[1:17:08] won't
[1:17:09] follow the Plan of Salvation to actually
[1:17:12] meet God you know it's very it's very
[1:17:15] simple here repent be baptized everyone
[1:17:16] you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:17:18] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:17:20] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:17:21] promises unto you and to your children
[1:17:23] all that are far off even as many as the
[1:17:24] Lord Our God shall call see the emotion
[1:17:27] that was there if it's just a religious
[1:17:29] spirit goes away when it comes to this
[1:17:32] because they'll take they'll take this
[1:17:34] any day when it comes to actually
[1:17:36] surrendering to the word that hung on
[1:17:39] Calvary it's all out of the picture you
[1:17:42] see but if you actually have the spirit
[1:17:43] of Christ you'll say yes Lord amen
[1:17:46] that's you Lord that's you being
[1:17:47] revealed I mean that's not Paul's I mean
[1:17:49] that's not Peter's opinion he didn't
[1:17:51] contradict Matthew 28 no he knew the the
[1:17:53] name of the father son Holy Ghost amen
[1:17:55] as we're standing there the Solomon's
[1:17:57] one fell name belong Papa picking and
[1:17:59] know Holy Ghost those are just titles
[1:18:02] that's not his name Peter stood up in
[1:18:04] the name of Jesus Christ he knew the
[1:18:06] name of the father son Holy Ghost amen
[1:18:08] as as Jesus said I come in my father's
[1:18:10] name and you receive me not what's the
[1:18:12] name of the father Jesus it's not
[1:18:14] complicated but you see so they would
[1:18:17] they would keep this above following
[1:18:19] this amen and then even even things that
[1:18:22] we take from for granted like expects in
[1:18:24] 1 Corinthians 11 how a woman should have
[1:18:25] uncut hair amen cuz it shows that her
[1:18:28] head is the word of God Amen and there's
[1:18:31] power for this cause ought the woman to
[1:18:32] have power on her head because of the
[1:18:34] Angels there Angelic protection and we
[1:18:36] know we have a living testimony of these
[1:18:38] things that they're true amen but you
[1:18:40] see I'm just I'm just to save time I'm
[1:18:43] not going to read it but you see now he
[1:18:44] says he says but if a woman have long
[1:18:47] hair it's a glory to her and her hair is
[1:18:48] given her for a covering see man says no
[1:18:51] you need to wear a a a thing you know a
[1:18:54] hat but the Bible says very clear no the
[1:18:56] woman's hairs are covering and that word
[1:18:58] long means to let grow that's right it's
[1:19:00] very simple so people will love
[1:19:04] this but when it comes to this no they
[1:19:06] don't want it that's right what spirit's
[1:19:09] motivating that person but we believe
[1:19:10] the whole word of God I mean you take
[1:19:13] the modern church
[1:19:15] today they would they would rip this out
[1:19:17] of their Bible let a woman learn in
[1:19:18] silence and with all subjection that I
[1:19:20] suffer not a woman to teach nor you
[1:19:22] super authority over with a man but to
[1:19:23] be in
[1:19:25] silence amen religious spirit loves this
[1:19:30] I'm I'm just you know but they'll say no
[1:19:33] Paul said this because of the cultural
[1:19:35] reasons of the day they'll explain it
[1:19:37] away amen but we say amen amen amen well
[1:19:42] what about in well silence in church
[1:19:43] can't they say Amen absolutely can they
[1:19:45] run the aisle a amen amen can God use
[1:19:48] gifts in them absolutely cuz that's God
[1:19:50] doing it amen you see but you see so all
[1:19:52] those things are here well then how
[1:19:54] about this one see a lot of people come
[1:19:56] to the message because what brother AR
[1:19:58] teaches they already agree with but in
[1:20:00] the wrong
[1:20:01] way like he says you men you meant to be
[1:20:03] heads of your own house how can you let
[1:20:05] your house be out of your woman your
[1:20:07] wives run a m and all these things they
[1:20:09] say yes because they're dominating
[1:20:11] they're not actually governing their
[1:20:12] house with love love should be the king
[1:20:15] of our home amen it shouldn't be now you
[1:20:18] lot listen XY Z this is a military
[1:20:20] Barracks you better conform otherwise
[1:20:22] milary police are going to run you
[1:20:23] around for a couple of years no that's
[1:20:25] not it it's love the love of God should
[1:20:28] be so influential in our homes and our
[1:20:30] lives that our family want to serve him
[1:20:33] even if okay we all you even having
[1:20:36] struggles whatever but deep down they
[1:20:37] want to serve God right so likewise ye
[1:20:39] husbands dwell with them according to
[1:20:41] knowledge that's their wives amen see H
[1:20:44] how about that where man would say no I
[1:20:46] don't want to dwell with my I don't want
[1:20:48] to understand them I don't need to
[1:20:50] understand them they just need to obey
[1:20:51] me that spirit is actually disagreeing
[1:20:53] with this
[1:20:55] word amen well they're just made of
[1:20:58] different material yeah but God
[1:21:00] understands us amen and we're the woman
[1:21:02] right amen can we not understand our
[1:21:06] wives amen I'm kind of I don't mean to
[1:21:09] GL I'm I'm just throwing some things out
[1:21:11] there because I want you to think about
[1:21:12] it because it's easy to talk about
[1:21:13] baptism and uncut here all these things
[1:21:15] but what about everyday living everyday
[1:21:18] living cuz remember our family should
[1:21:19] not be
[1:21:20] dictatorship that's right no there not
[1:21:22] dictatorship it should be the love of
[1:21:24] God you know if you have to yell and
[1:21:26] scream and throw fits and and and and
[1:21:28] and and what do you call it you know uh
[1:21:31] basically yeah just do all those kind of
[1:21:33] things to govern your marriage you got
[1:21:36] problems and the problem actually
[1:21:38] because remember you point a finger
[1:21:39] there's three pointing back at you amen
[1:21:41] because the head of the house should
[1:21:43] live in such a way an atmosphere should
[1:21:44] come down in the home amen that actually
[1:21:47] binds the family together amen will
[1:21:49] there be things that come in and try and
[1:21:51] destroy the home absolutely but the love
[1:21:53] of God should so rule there should be an
[1:21:54] atmosphere amen that when we pray God
[1:21:57] should come down that our children
[1:21:59] should not our spouses should not there
[1:22:00] should be God should come to who's with
[1:22:02] me this this is not crazy talk this is
[1:22:04] reality we're the priest head of our
[1:22:07] home is priests and amen we should be
[1:22:08] able to pray in such a way that God just
[1:22:10] comes
[1:22:11] down amen that it takes away all the
[1:22:13] things that the devil tries to bring
[1:22:14] into our lives
[1:22:16] Hallelujah husbands love your wives even
[1:22:18] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:22:20] himself for it amen well lot of people
[1:22:23] that's totally out of the question you
[1:22:24] mean give over my life you mean
[1:22:26] sacrifice my hobbies sacrifice what I
[1:22:28] want to do my me time oh boy well then
[1:22:32] they can't agree with the scripture
[1:22:33] should I put the picture of Jesus there
[1:22:35] again it's a religious
[1:22:38] spirit no I'm the head they have to do
[1:22:40] what I say no you've got to give
[1:22:41] yourself you got to love husbands must
[1:22:44] love their wives even as Christ also
[1:22:46] loved the church and gave himself for
[1:22:49] it amen you see and then also see so
[1:22:53] ought we just go down to verse 28 so
[1:22:55] ought men to love their wives as their
[1:22:57] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[1:22:59] loveth himself for no man ever yet
[1:23:01] hateth his own flesh but nourisheth us
[1:23:03] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[1:23:06] church for we are members of his body
[1:23:08] and of his flesh and of his bones like
[1:23:10] telling the telling um some brothers
[1:23:13] here in the Solomons you know it's not
[1:23:14] like you ever who's ever you know put a
[1:23:17] you know hit a nail into the wall and
[1:23:19] you hit your thumb and you start abusing
[1:23:21] your hand and arm because it's
[1:23:23] stupid I've never seen anyone do that
[1:23:26] I've never seen anyone drop the hammer
[1:23:27] and just start abusing their hand say
[1:23:29] you stupid hand you stupid hand you're
[1:23:31] useless how do you no why is that
[1:23:34] because they realize they the hand is
[1:23:37] part of them yeah they are one there's
[1:23:40] not a connection line it just all merges
[1:23:42] and it should be the same thing with our
[1:23:43] spouses amen amen amen you realize you
[1:23:46] are one amen hello we just went
[1:23:50] segwaying but hey let's enjoy the segue
[1:23:52] amen this is how it should be we should
[1:23:55] never be angry at them like they no
[1:23:59] we're part of each other just like even
[1:24:01] the body of Christ hello we just extend
[1:24:05] extended the family line of it here we
[1:24:06] go but we're all by one Spirit we're
[1:24:08] baptized into one body amen amen so why
[1:24:12] get you know yes so but that's how some
[1:24:15] people and the people over there got it
[1:24:16] they laughed you know cuz sometimes they
[1:24:18] people just fly off the handle you woman
[1:24:21] you listen Len here
[1:24:23] you're part of each other amen you need
[1:24:25] a revelation
[1:24:27] amen thank you Lord amen amen praise the
[1:24:30] Lord
[1:24:32] now but how can you be part of him and
[1:24:35] then deny him how can I deny my hand
[1:24:37] being my hand if I do there's something
[1:24:40] mentally wrong with me and how can I if
[1:24:42] there is something mentally wrong with
[1:24:43] me deny that's my hand deny that's my
[1:24:45] foot there is something spiritually
[1:24:47] wrong with the believer that denies any
[1:24:49] word that God ever said and promised
[1:24:51] there is something spiritually wrong
[1:24:53] with that so-called believer you can't
[1:24:54] deny one letter of him because you have
[1:24:58] become part of the same you are part of
[1:25:00] him because you're baptized into him by
[1:25:02] the Holy Spirit has brought you into the
[1:25:04] body of Jesus Christ what a beautiful
[1:25:07] thing amen so just in truth like a
[1:25:09] husband can't deny a wife and the other
[1:25:11] way around they're part of the same one
[1:25:13] body amen you can't deny the word if you
[1:25:15] say you're part of it amen you can't say
[1:25:18] yes but that's for another age amen that
[1:25:20] Spirit still Creeps in here am me we say
[1:25:22] yes it was once upon a time but no it's
[1:25:26] you know that's history no the days of
[1:25:28] Miracles has not passed we have been
[1:25:30] restored to the book of Acts Church
[1:25:32] before it fell amen before it said that
[1:25:34] Pharisees said th Believers came in and
[1:25:36] tried to bring in former former things
[1:25:38] into the church no we have gone past
[1:25:40] that back to a back to a book of Acts
[1:25:43] before that church ever fell amen but
[1:25:46] you see now people say well we need to
[1:25:48] we need to get the get the mechanics and
[1:25:50] the Dynamics together then God God will
[1:25:52] finally move I'll say that's already
[1:25:53] here because we believe the whole thing
[1:25:56] because some people they will quench the
[1:25:58] spirit they don't want the Holy Ghost to
[1:25:59] move at all even in message circles but
[1:26:02] I say that no we need the mechanics and
[1:26:04] we need the Dynamics amen like brother
[1:26:07] Brown would say about how there's the
[1:26:08] fundamentalist this is why I was
[1:26:09] thinking about how you know people say
[1:26:12] that we are Baptists but then you know
[1:26:14] we're between Baptist and Pentecostals I
[1:26:15] thought no that's not right we believe
[1:26:17] the whole Bible am mean so he says in my
[1:26:19] travels I find two classes of people I
[1:26:21] see one of them fundamentals
[1:26:23] positionally they know by the mechanics
[1:26:25] that they are Sons they are to be sons
[1:26:27] and daughters in God and I said the next
[1:26:28] one I find is the Pentecostals they have
[1:26:31] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit but
[1:26:32] I said the fundamentals positioning know
[1:26:34] where they're at but they don't have any
[1:26:36] faith in the word and the Pentecostal
[1:26:38] have got a lot of faith but don't know
[1:26:40] where um who they are I said it's like a
[1:26:42] man who had money in the bank and could
[1:26:44] not write a check and one could write a
[1:26:46] check but had no money in the bank if
[1:26:48] you could just get them together a lot
[1:26:50] of people put that in the future it's
[1:26:51] already here amen I'm looking at people
[1:26:54] that have got money in the bank and
[1:26:55] checkbook authority to to spend it amen
[1:26:59] Amy says well what makes them act like
[1:27:01] that it's letting off the steam I said I
[1:27:03] don't think that would have have to be
[1:27:05] necessary I said but they've got to give
[1:27:07] vent somewhere I said now if we could
[1:27:09] just take all the Steam and could know
[1:27:11] how to direct it fundamentally in the
[1:27:12] word the big regime of God would start
[1:27:14] moving on there is where Satan got in to
[1:27:17] make it all mechanics and no Dynamics in
[1:27:19] other words only part of the word right
[1:27:22] back all Dynamics and no mechanics see
[1:27:24] we've got to put it together we've got
[1:27:27] uh We've Got The Power of the Holy
[1:27:28] Spirit but we've got to come back with
[1:27:30] the word to feed this machine I say we
[1:27:33] have been restored back to the true word
[1:27:35] of God I mean so we' got the best fuel
[1:27:37] to put in the tank amen the spark plugs
[1:27:39] are firing amen the cylinders are
[1:27:41] working amen remember when brother
[1:27:43] Braham left he did not leave a gospel
[1:27:45] that could not be manifested that's
[1:27:47] right I mean he did not leave a gospel
[1:27:49] that had to be fixed it had to be
[1:27:50] tampered with it had to be edited or
[1:27:52] whatever no it was delivered how God
[1:27:55] wanted to be delivered amen and he put a
[1:27:57] faith in it people to receive it how it
[1:27:59] was delivered and that Faith came in to
[1:28:01] manifest what was preached amen so we
[1:28:04] don't just have the word and no Spirit
[1:28:06] right we are not void of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:09] which it's just dry sermons and dry
[1:28:10] worship time and dry after services and
[1:28:13] God doesn't move we are not void of the
[1:28:14] spirit amen I believe he can move more
[1:28:16] though don't get me wrong I wanted more
[1:28:18] Hallelujah I want way more than what we
[1:28:20] have amen but we're not void of the
[1:28:22] spirit and neither are we void of the
[1:28:23] word amen amen we have both that's right
[1:28:26] Hallelujah so we have been now we have
[1:28:29] been restored back the mechanics and the
[1:28:32] Dynamics are here and the reason I can
[1:28:34] say that is because we believe the whole
[1:28:35] word of God we don't just believe in
[1:28:38] gifts we believe in The Giver amen we
[1:28:40] don't just believe in well you've got to
[1:28:41] dress a holy way and church and all
[1:28:44] these things no we believe in that and
[1:28:45] the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost I mean we
[1:28:47] don't just believe in you know making a
[1:28:50] making a confession of faith and giving
[1:28:52] a sinner prayer that's not even really
[1:28:53] part of the word right and it's good to
[1:28:56] start there but don't stay there amen we
[1:28:58] you we don't just believe like Luther
[1:28:59] Luther saw the pillar of fire begin to
[1:29:01] move out of the Dark Ages he read in the
[1:29:04] Bible that just shall live by faith now
[1:29:06] the challenge would have been for you
[1:29:07] and I because there the trail of the
[1:29:08] Holy Ghost coming through a restoration
[1:29:10] would you have joined Luther or would
[1:29:12] have you stayed in the Catholic Church
[1:29:14] what would you have done amen when he
[1:29:16] preached that J shall live by faith and
[1:29:17] a Reformation started am me what would
[1:29:20] you do because that was the word being
[1:29:21] restored
[1:29:22] amen and then Wesley came along and and
[1:29:25] he preached that just shall live by
[1:29:27] faith his heart actually got ignited
[1:29:28] because he read or heard being read uh
[1:29:31] uh um Martin Luther's um writings on the
[1:29:34] book of Romans he said his heart was
[1:29:36] strangely warmed at that time he is
[1:29:38] already an Anglican priest but he
[1:29:39] miserably failed in America as a
[1:29:41] missionary he went back to England and
[1:29:44] but but his but his life was transformed
[1:29:46] because he heard that uh being read and
[1:29:48] he didn't just believe in the just shall
[1:29:50] live by faith he believed no we should
[1:29:51] live a holy life God was now restoring
[1:29:54] now the challenge would have been for us
[1:29:55] would you stay in the Lutheran Church or
[1:29:57] the Anglican church or you Joy join this
[1:30:00] real short fellow redheaded man preached
[1:30:02] in The Meadows and even from his
[1:30:04] father's grave and different places
[1:30:06] would you join those people amen what
[1:30:09] would you have done absolutely amen I
[1:30:11] yeah I've seen in my family history that
[1:30:13] you're with the name gloin that the
[1:30:14] first one who put the ear on the end was
[1:30:16] actually a Methodist circuit preacher
[1:30:18] right after Wesley died now that's neat
[1:30:21] history but it's not going help me none
[1:30:22] if I don't know the same God he knew
[1:30:25] amen but you see what would we have done
[1:30:27] would we have joined wisley and been
[1:30:28] made fun of and all these things or
[1:30:30] would we stayed in the past amen and
[1:30:33] then the Pentecostals came along so I'm
[1:30:35] skipping a few with a pillar of fire
[1:30:36] move but then the Pentecostals came
[1:30:38] there's a cry for the restoration of the
[1:30:40] gifts amen and they were called trash
[1:30:43] and outwash and Fanatics and all these
[1:30:45] things what would you have done they had
[1:30:47] church services that happened more than
[1:30:49] once where people while they're having
[1:30:50] church people actually shot through the
[1:30:51] the windows at them and the bullets as
[1:30:53] the woman was singing the spirit and
[1:30:55] dancing the bullets just fell off their
[1:30:56] dresses didn't even hurt them none but
[1:30:58] people were trying to disrupt their
[1:30:59] services like that would you have gone
[1:31:01] to church in that era like that oh yeah
[1:31:04] prise Lord your attitude now be attitude
[1:31:06] then amen but see the pillar of fire was
[1:31:08] moving but you see now see but that
[1:31:11] wasn't the end of it they thought they
[1:31:12] were fully restored but the word hadn't
[1:31:14] been restored am me then of course God
[1:31:17] sent God sent brother Bram to fulfill
[1:31:20] Malachi 4 to turn the of the children
[1:31:22] back to the fathers amen that's what the
[1:31:24] ministry was sent to do and he also says
[1:31:27] that as the days of Noah and the days of
[1:31:29] lot you a lot of people can say yes
[1:31:32] we're living in a sodomite age again
[1:31:34] right everyone around the world says
[1:31:36] that doesn't matter you know they can
[1:31:37] agree doesn't matter what religion
[1:31:39] they're part of but then when you come
[1:31:41] down even thus shall it be in the day
[1:31:43] when the son of man is revealed you see
[1:31:46] who is the son of man Jesus Christ amen
[1:31:49] so so anyone can say yes the world's in
[1:31:51] this we said no hold on in this day this
[1:31:53] should happen and you can say look it
[1:31:55] has happened amen we know brother
[1:31:58] Brown's Ministry initiated the post
[1:32:00] World War II healing Revival that swept
[1:32:02] the world but see all that was done now
[1:32:05] to to gather a people for the word to be
[1:32:08] restored now what would you have done in
[1:32:10] that day would you have been caught up
[1:32:12] in just the healings or you have
[1:32:14] followed the pillar of fire as the Lord
[1:32:16] revealed
[1:32:17] himself see a lot of people say if only
[1:32:20] I lived 50 years ago and 60 years ago
[1:32:22] back then and they talk about what God
[1:32:25] did back then but what about now about
[1:32:27] now what about now because he's still
[1:32:30] the Jehovah of Miracles he still sets
[1:32:32] the captives free he still casts out
[1:32:34] Devils I can say I've seen more God do
[1:32:36] more things in these four walls that I
[1:32:38] have on the mission field I've seen him
[1:32:39] do a lot of things over there why cuz
[1:32:41] he's the same today amen his promises
[1:32:44] are true but you see we must become one
[1:32:47] with the word in this day amen we got to
[1:32:48] see the pillar of fire move it's not
[1:32:51] just a photograph anymore see that
[1:32:53] photograph was taken to document God was
[1:32:55] there it's not even about the man
[1:32:57] brother Braham said I was just there
[1:32:58] when my when his photo was taken but you
[1:33:00] see that same Pillar of Fire is still
[1:33:02] here in 2024 amen amen I trust you're
[1:33:05] not getting too bored here now we we're
[1:33:07] going to we're going to wind up here a
[1:33:08] little bit amen but you see the problem
[1:33:10] is of this age I don't have the full
[1:33:13] thing you read in Revelations 3 about
[1:33:14] the age of lady oia yeah Jesus says
[1:33:18] behold I stand at the door and knock you
[1:33:20] see so what ises he doing he's not just
[1:33:22] knocking at people's hearts to come in
[1:33:24] actually what it means he's on the
[1:33:26] outside of the church world yeah amen
[1:33:28] he's on the outside of the church world
[1:33:30] trying to get back in why they've kicked
[1:33:32] him out because they've received Creeds
[1:33:34] and dogmas of man and you see that's why
[1:33:37] that's why the way we follow the whole
[1:33:39] word of God is considered heresy because
[1:33:41] he's not in the churches anymore he's
[1:33:43] been kicked out he's been evicted but
[1:33:45] you see as as many uh if any man hear my
[1:33:48] voice and open the door I'll come into
[1:33:50] him and we s with him and he with me
[1:33:52] amen so if you hear his voice and I I I
[1:33:54] pray to God you hear his voice don't
[1:33:56] hear my voice hear his voice and you
[1:33:58] open your hearts door and say Lord come
[1:33:59] in dwell with me amen then what happens
[1:34:02] you'll have communion one with another
[1:34:04] you and God Amen so you see he's on the
[1:34:06] outside trying to get back in yeah amen
[1:34:10] but why has he gone this way is because
[1:34:11] people have just taken part of the word
[1:34:13] and say this is it and this has always
[1:34:16] been Satan's plan down Through the Ages
[1:34:18] it's that misconstruing that part of the
[1:34:20] scripture that applies to the day he'll
[1:34:23] let you know all Jesus did was perfectly
[1:34:25] well he'll let you know all that Moses
[1:34:26] did was perfectly well but when you take
[1:34:28] the promises that they gave for this day
[1:34:31] then that was applied to another age
[1:34:33] that's all he has to do he is to get the
[1:34:35] people to believe it that way and that's
[1:34:37] all for you cannot take one word away
[1:34:39] from it and add or add one word one word
[1:34:41] to it that's what he does and that's why
[1:34:44] people will cabbage down on the quote
[1:34:46] that says the Holy Ghost comes without
[1:34:48] sensation they say well people don't
[1:34:50] receive the Holy Ghost like did back
[1:34:52] then and brother says the word can only
[1:34:54] bring forth screaming hollering acts 238
[1:34:57] young come on now I mean he says that in
[1:34:58] the choosing of the Bride or one of
[1:35:01] those messages but you see now but
[1:35:03] people fail to take the rest of that
[1:35:05] quote that says but it's the word of God
[1:35:07] Jesus Christ fulfilling himself in the
[1:35:10] life amen so the sensation may be
[1:35:12] different but what's he doing in your
[1:35:15] life now amen is he living he's doing
[1:35:17] his works now through your life amen I
[1:35:20] trust that's okay amen yes everyone's
[1:35:22] testimony is different but you got to
[1:35:23] see there's got to be a definite
[1:35:25] something's got to happen to you amen we
[1:35:27] can look back and say from that point on
[1:35:29] something happened I'm a different
[1:35:31] person amen my life has
[1:35:33] changed you see there were there were
[1:35:35] arguments back in his day saying you
[1:35:37] know people would debate with them
[1:35:39] you're trying to you're trying to inject
[1:35:41] into this age an Apostolic Doctrine the
[1:35:44] apostolic age ceased with the apostles
[1:35:46] that's what people were saying so in
[1:35:47] other words they saying yes that
[1:35:49] happened but it was back there it
[1:35:50] doesn't apply today so basically what
[1:35:52] they're saying is we don't believe that
[1:35:54] part of the word is actually relevant we
[1:35:56] don't believe that part but brother BR
[1:35:58] believe the the whole word like we do
[1:36:00] like the Apostle Paul did amen he says
[1:36:03] he says I asked him well do you believe
[1:36:05] believe the word he said yes I said
[1:36:06] Revelations 2218 says whosoever shall
[1:36:09] take one word out of this or add one
[1:36:10] word to it not just two words one word
[1:36:12] take one word out I said then I can tell
[1:36:15] you where the apostolic age was given
[1:36:18] the apostolic blessing was given to the
[1:36:19] church now you tell me where God taken
[1:36:21] it out of the church by the word you
[1:36:23] can't do it it's not there I said now
[1:36:25] remember that that Peter on the day of
[1:36:27] Pentecost he was the introducer of the
[1:36:29] apostolic age he told all of them to
[1:36:31] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:36:33] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:36:35] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:37] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:36:38] children them that are far off even as
[1:36:40] many as the Lord Our God shall call amen
[1:36:43] so we believe the whole word of God Amen
[1:36:46] we don't just believe portion amen I
[1:36:48] agree Hallelujah you see God moves right
[1:36:51] on amen that's
[1:36:54] why that's why people even you know
[1:36:57] maybe I'm just got to wind up with this
[1:37:00] I know this is very you say well I'm
[1:37:01] telling you what we believe we believe
[1:37:03] the whole word of God Amen okay we don't
[1:37:05] just believe portion we believe the
[1:37:08] entire Bible amen the not just not just
[1:37:11] bits that suit not just bits that are
[1:37:13] are culturally acceptable we believe the
[1:37:15] whole word I mean you see the Bible
[1:37:17] promised that this gospel would just
[1:37:19] become so each day just like the day of
[1:37:21] Luther he taught justification it come
[1:37:24] the minority when he come into the
[1:37:25] wisley and Methodist age through
[1:37:27] sanctification then when they settled
[1:37:29] down to a church and there was that was
[1:37:31] all there was to it God raised up
[1:37:33] Pentecost now it's got to the place that
[1:37:35] Pentecost is becoming formal and
[1:37:36] indifferent God moves right on that's he
[1:37:39] won't stop at all he goes right on the
[1:37:41] children of Israel followed a pillar of
[1:37:43] fire and every time that fire stopped
[1:37:45] they stopped with it and if they didn't
[1:37:46] move they were left in the wilderness
[1:37:48] they had to move where the fire moved
[1:37:50] that's the way God Church does always
[1:37:52] does it moves with the fire when Martin
[1:37:54] Luther saw the fire First Reformation he
[1:37:56] came out of the Catholic church he built
[1:37:58] his denomination under it the fire moved
[1:38:00] into sanctification he was um already
[1:38:02] organized under that and couldn't do it
[1:38:04] uh couldn't go go any further Methodist
[1:38:07] took it they organized under that they
[1:38:09] couldn't go no further Pentecost came
[1:38:11] and took it from them now if we don't
[1:38:13] watch the fire will move right on again
[1:38:16] let's stay under the fire worship under
[1:38:17] the fire Worship in the power of the
[1:38:19] spirit believing God's word laying aside
[1:38:22] every weight and every sin that does so
[1:38:24] easily beset us that's what we're going
[1:38:27] to do we say where's the fire moving on
[1:38:29] now this is going to take us all the way
[1:38:30] into a Rapture amen amen amen this is
[1:38:33] the final voice to the final age but you
[1:38:34] see we can't just organize it and say
[1:38:37] well this is just a systematic way of
[1:38:39] believing and that's it walk with God
[1:38:41] Amen take the whole word of God Amen
[1:38:44] don't just take the things that you like
[1:38:45] take the whole word surrender to the
[1:38:47] whole word of God and watch him fulfill
