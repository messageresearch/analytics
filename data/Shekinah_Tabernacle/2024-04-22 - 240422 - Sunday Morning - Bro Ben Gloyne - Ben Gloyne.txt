musicians praise the lord we can have our hope in the lord amen god bless you friends so just uh just a reminder the agm is about two o'clock um this afternoon we're having lunch next door beforehand um i'm sure well there's only one of them here trying to wait for both of them to be here but um just i'm sure everyone's aware that uh ben and margie are courting just want to pray that yeah the lord bless you keep you and guide you and god bless you i'm sure everyone is aware of that but i thought there's some people that you know the grapevine doesn't get to them normally that's me but anyway so god bless you um we're going to go to first chronicles um this morning i've got a couple of it's been a week but i'm glad we can come and just rejoice in god um i'd also like to just express our deepest sympathy sister barbara for your your sister went to bear the lord about a week i'm so sorry if you're in the bondo family pray the lord comfort you all at this time and our prayers are with you and yeah god bless you so first chronicles i mean yeah we're in first chronicles aren't we 22. and then we're going to go to genesis 45 and i'll just pray somehow the lord will uh tie these two scriptures together so first chronicles 22 and 9. this is david speaking to to solomon and he says behold maybe maybe let's just go up to verse five let's just go back up to verse five and david said solomon my son is young and tender in the house that is to be billed for the lord must be exceedingly magnifical of fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore now make preparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the lord god of israel and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build a house unto the name of the lord my god but the word of the lord came to me saying thou has shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars thou shall not build a house unto my name because thou has shed much blood upon the earth and my sight behold a son shall be born to thee which shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days and he shall build and house for my name and he shall be my son and i'll be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom forever i mean over israel forever now my son the lord be with thee prosper thou and build the house of the lord thy god as he has said of thee only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give the charge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god then shall thou prosper if thou take his heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed and let's just go to genesis we're going to go to genesis 45 and we're going to read from verse 24 just down to verse 28 i'm here as well and this is this is now joseph has revealed himself to his brethren he's uh sent his brothers back to get his family and he's and so now word is coming to jacob now he says here in genesis 45 and 24 he says so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them see that ye fall not out of the way and they came out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father and told them saying joseph is yet alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacob's heart fainted for he believed them not and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had seen to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive oh i will go and see him before i die i mean so let's just bow he's in a word of prayer if anyone's got a need you know raise your hands to the lord this morning amen i'm so glad our our lord is mindful of every situation aren't you amen gracious father as we come to approach your great divine presence once again this morning we want to thank you we can approach you by your precious blood thank you lord that when you see us lord you don't see us oh god but you see your blood and you hear our voice through the blood lord and we want to thank you that you have allowed us to have fellowship with you you have allowed us to walk with you in this in this life and lord to know you in the power of your resurrection oh god and i just pray father that you'll take your word now as we've read two portions of scripture i pray you'll come and anoint your word one more time lord we've come to see you the living god we've not come to hear some lecture or something of man but lord we come to meet with you today so i pray lord may you as we've invited you here may you just lord come to every seat come to every heart lord may just have prayer minutes touch our lives our god and speak to us like only you can lord we just want to lift those who couldn't be here today be their portion and their strength today oh god father anyone's second body lord just think of sister k father may heal her body restore her for your glory peter as well we thank you lord that you're mindful of every need every situation we love you lord we just want to commit our lives into your hands once again lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you may have your seats this morning so it's a bit of an unusual uh group of scripture but brother brown makes a very uh interesting statement in the message how can i overcome he says now i want to take my subject this morning of this how can i overcome now i chose this because i think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die we've got to keep in revival constantly revived every day paul said he had to die daily that christ could live and we must never let that revival die within us so so the very purpose of him preaching the sermon how can i overcome is that the spirit of of revival would remain among the people within us and and and and i pray this is what we want i mean we want the spirit of revival just to grow and get stronger we don't want it to die we don't want it to go away but we know it's the devil's job to take us to try and take us out of revival amen but it's god's job to keep us in revival so it depends which one we side with is is what's going to happen in our life so i'm so glad that we can side with the spirit of god i mean that we can keep the spirit of revival among us now we read here in in first chronicles 22 because i well i just picked up lily's bible a few days ago and the book mark was on this chapter and you know i just started reading i thought it's very interesting how how when david was giving his last commandments to to solomon he would give him these words he says he says if thou take us he to fulfill the statues and judgments which the lord charge moses with concerning israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed now if we go back into uh joshua chapter one we see the those kind of instructions were given to joshua joshua we know was instructed to take the people over from you know you know out of the wilderness into the promised land the first words of well let's just go to joshua chapter one shall we let's um let's have a bit of a reading here um this morning where if we go to joshua chapter one and if we go to verse uh well we can just read from verse one it says now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of none moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan now and all this people under the land which i do give them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon it shall be given unto you as i said unto moses and then he outlines the the you know the um there in verse 4 the the boundaries of the land he says there shall not be in verse five any man shall be able to stand before the all the days of thy life as i was with moses so shall i be with thee i'll not foul thee nor forsake thee that he says be strong and of good courage for under this people shall thou divide for an adherence the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them and then he repeats it only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses thy servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand to the left and thou mayest prosper wheresoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate there on day and night that thou mayest observe observe to do according to all that's written therein for then thou shall there now shall make thy way prosperous then thou shalt then thou shall have good success have i not commanded thee be strong and be of a good courage be not afraid neither bow that be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wherever thou goest so this is now there was a you could say there was a dispensational change among the believers they had been in the wilderness they had been you know there and the going around the mountain 40 years and all the things happened there the church splits and the trouble and everything going on but then finally there came a time where god said you've gone around this mountain long enough i never wanted you in the wilderness anyway turn northward cross jordan and go possess the land so there was a there was a change remember brother abraham said that you know you know moses representing the law could never take the people into the promised land it was grace that had to take them and jo and joshua represented that and so now here they are in this dispensational change if i can put it that way and god is telling joshua be strong be of good courage don't be dismayed you know and so so he he's telling joshua this because joshua needs to hear this because there'll be things that will happen in the land that will make him dismayed there'll be things that could potentially make him be afraid but he's told be strong and very courageous so what you're about to do be strong in it have courage don't be afraid and because he says the lord thy god will will go with thee wherever you go so the reason you cannot be afraid is because god is with you i mean the reason you don't need to be dismayed is because god will sort it out god will fight your battles i mean so there was a there was a charge given to him be of good courage and then we can even drop down in joshua and i have it here somewhere where joshua's final words to the children of israel he now gives the same um the same commission to the children of israel when he's about to die so you could say in his last sermon he gives us these words so we're in joshua 23 now and we're just going to read this i just want to show you that there seems to be whenever whenever god is is is moving and he's changing you could say what what is happening he gives this charge be strong and very courageous don't be dismayed amen footsteps of possession wherever you put your foot on whatever promise you lay your hold upon it's yours amen sure you have to fight but it's yours amen so we're in joshua 23 verse 4 he says behold i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all the nations that i have cut off even unto the great sea westward and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and shall drive them out of your sight and you shall possess their land as the lord your god hath promised unto you but but be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that's written in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not aside they're into the right hand or to the left so so the commission that that was given joshua he passes on to the future generation the next generation because remember they had to possess the whole land it wasn't just what they had which was good they had to take the whole promise not just part of the word the whole world had to you know we fight not against flesh and blood but against spiritual powers spiritual wickedness and high places and so the devil's job is to try and rob us from our god-given rights that's that's why he's here he's a bluff he's an accuser he is the you know he's the one just like in um in a zechariah there was you know joshua uh was the high priest there and he was he was a raid and filthy governor so yeah or zerubbabel was i may get it mixed up but i trust you understand where i'm reading from and and satan was standing at the right hand of the high priest that was arrayed and finally i'm with the right and dirty rags to resist him but then the lord said the lord rebuked thee satan you know and and the devil was cast away and then and then god uh you know and then the high priest was instructed take off the filthy rags and put on the priest garments put on the high priest garment so the enemy was there to withstand that man the high priest coming into his office and don't you think the same devil will be withstanding you amen because he knows he remembers the day he lost the stinger of death he remembers the day he lost his keys you know and he can try and reason it all he wants but he knows jesus came into hell robbed him of the keys of hell death and the grave he knew the day when he was absolutely defeated but he's going to still withstand you to try and stop you coming to you into your position because we've received a word in this hour i mean where the apostle paul said that we're joint heirs with christ right we're made in the image of the lord and now we're here to fulfill that promise and he knew how powerful remember nothing could stand before our lord jesus cancer couldn't stand before him legions of demons couldn't hold a predestinated seed i mean you know he couldn't get drowned on the sea of galilee nothing can stop him superstition couldn't stop him religion couldn't stop him trouble in the church couldn't stop him nothing could stop him fulfilling his job and you and then we come down 2 000 years later and you see the prophet of god you know he was told nothing shall stand before thy prayers not even cancer amen so and and you could see nothing no enemy that came before him could stand before him amen every kind of sickness trouble whatever it was it couldn't stop him unbelief couldn't stop him religious prejudice couldn't stop him jealousy couldn't stop him nothing could stop him he walked on victorious i mean though he had a lot of trouble in his life we know we're not exempt from trouble but yet no demon power could stop him and god did not do that in our generation just to say well you could look back at that and say how neat that was no god was showing the power of the blood and he's showing the power of his salvation in a redeemed son of god i mean a redeemed man right brother brown was born in sin like we were he needed saving he needed the holy ghost like we do right but so god would take god would take a man and show this is what calvary achieves amen and now he doesn't just put it out there to say well that's him and now you could never you could never live a victorious life like that no he did it to show you this is what my blood does i mean to show you a living example this is a victorious christian amen and as he was called to be a victorious believer so we are called to be victorious believers that no weapon formed against he shall prosper i mean no no trouble no complex no pain no hurt amen none of those things amen are called to hold us back i will try right we have a real enemy he's not make believe he's not a thought he's a real enemy and he works 24 7 to try and stop you coming to your position because he knows as as the lord jesus came into his position and and the devils just had to fly for their lives they cried out you know have you come to torment us before the time you know they knew that number was coming and and they thought has it really come already have you come to torment us you know even before the time and though you know but now we're coming down to the day where they will be destroyed they will be tormented they will all the things they've done to humanity they will they've they've they've sowed now they're gonna reap the devil sowed now he's going to reap amen and he's going to pay for every single sin that he ever caused anyone to ever do glory to god amen but now we see here where there's a challenge now we never want to let the spirit of revival die now we read about jacob because jacob jacob had a very um you know this part where joseph was was um taken you know his his own sons you know sold them into slavery and lied about it took us took his um coat of many colors and he put it in goat's blood and seen a wild animal oh we just happened to find this in the desert and you know cooking up the story and and and jacob was was heartbroken for a long time though he was a prophet though he was a believer right we're going to meet jacob one day we're gonna we're gonna say jacob what was like to wrestle with the angel and he could actually ask us what it was like what was like for you to wrestle with the angel hallelujah because there comes a time where god gets a hold of you and you just get a hold of him say i want more than just a touch i want that you go till you change me you change my name you change my walk you change all that i am hallelujahs we'll be able to sit down and have fellowship and say i can relate to you jacob because i have the same kind of experience i mean i tried to work out my own survival just like he did hatch plans send gifts to esau and all these things but you know god has a way of just stripping everything from us because he wants you he doesn't want your schemes he wants you hallelujah so i thank god that's how god operates so jacob now he would he would spend now i just did a quick search so my maths and you know math was never my strong point but yes joseph was about 17 years old when he was sold into slavery and when he was 30 he became second in charge of all egypt that's when he was exalted to the right hand of pharaoh and so there was the seven years of of of plenty and then i think it after about two years of the famine is when joseph revealed himself to his brethren and jacob came down to egypt so if i can so that's about 22 years that jacob lived and i'll put it this way with an unrevived spirit that's a long time to be brokenhearted and he thought he was going to carry it to his grave so trauma the trauma in jacob's life it was real trauma he thought his son his favorite son he thought he was really dead you know so that trauma caused him to live just functioning but not as his former self trauma's a real thing pain's a real thing you know we are human beings okay some people realize they're human so pain affects us right we're not immune from pain we're not immune from trials we're not immune from hardship you know with and and even even it can be the you know many times trauma can blindside us well i don't expect this to happen well if we expected it to happen we would have bypassed it right so so this is how jacob was he was he was in such a way that i'm not sure if i have it in my notes but but when but when you know his sons brought the coat of many colors remember they just sold they just sold joseph into slavery maybe the silver was still um chinking in there you know clicking in their pockets as they go trying to be sad and upset and trying to you know try and put on this act because they knew he was alive they knew where he was going but they they put on this act they found the you know they took his coat of many colors dipped in the goat's blood and they come to their father maybe maybe they just you know i don't know how they pretended to cry they're all upset you know but the silver's still in their pockets of that payment and they're trying to say you know we found this in the wilderness just seemed to happen i don't know what's going on and then jacob was so brokenhearted he says he refused to be comforted so even so so his family his whole family his daughter-in-law's and his whole family his sons tried to comfort him but he said he but it says the bible he refused to be comforted so he lived in this pain and it caused them to to no doubt whenever joseph's name was was mentioned it just just brought the pain all back again and but i want you to notice now that we know that god was working out something as joseph would tell us brethren when he revealed himself in egypt he says don't be angry this is all done that life would be preserved so there's a bigger picture here than you know sure your jealousy caused me to go down and you know go down through the suffering but god has allowed it that i would end up here your lives would be saved you know our lineage would continue on god's hand was in all this even though many times in the dungeon i looked up and i did not see where he was but he was working and we can i'm sure we can look back in our lives and we can be in our darkest moments and we can and just know god's hand was there hallelujah his unseen hand and then so now notice notice jacob jacobs jacob's heart or his spirit was not revived when he received word from his sons that joseph was alive sometimes it takes more than word more than a word to revive someone's spirit it takes spirit and it takes the word and the spirit together to quicken someone revive them back to life i mean so so it wasn't it wasn't the you know even even the right words that they can be true sometimes that's just not enough it takes the spirit of god to bring and anoint that word right amen so i'm not saying don't don't try and comfort one another with words and nice things no no do that but say lord anoint it when i'm speaking to someone when i'm sharing things when i'm trying to comfort them might not just be words that i should say because if this is happening maybe a real heart in it i mean may there be the spirit of god in it so so you see it wasn't but but it's when he saw the evidence that joseph was alive remember the wagons that came with them back into canaan they didn't leave with those wagons they weren't their possession he saw he saw something coming with them more than just their words that he's alive evidence was coming though he never saw he never saw joseph that time when he saw the wagons that came with them out of egypt then his spirit revived when he saw the evidence amen when he saw the evidence that his favorite son was alive he came back to he revived his pain was gone and that was the expectation i'm going to see him again it wasn't the end of the story 20 years ago but now now there's going to be a wonderful reunion hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and i when we see the evidence of god amen when we see the evidence of god more than just words more than nice sermons more than nice songs but when god sends the evidence there's a land beyond the river i mean there's a place in eternity for you there's a there's a mansion there's a theophany body amen that you're about to step into when god sends the evidence you say well what is the evidence you know you know you sometimes just feel the presence of god strike you and and maybe it might convict you to do right or maybe you say oh you've got to surrender more or something do you know what that really is brother it says it's like your theophany bumping into you it's actually eternity bumping into you and it bumps into you and the more we're in revival the more you know what i love about this this is god's work we are his workmanship we're not our own workmanship this is not us trying to get ourselves to glory no this is god getting us to glory remember brother graham said the bridegroom call will come right through this message so a bridegroom call has been sent more than when we want we didn't even want it when we were born but god put something in us that we wanted it something to receive it so god has prepared a place for us so now what happens is it's actually eternity comes and bumps against you it's your theophany bumping against you and eventually it won't just be a bump and a bump but it'll you'll speed up it'll slow down and it'll be a connection and our bodies will be transformed hallelujah this is what's going on this way you know we actually have the evidence of heaven hallelujah more than just a putting a picture up of an empty tomb in jerusalem which is all perfectly fine but we've got more than that i mean but we have the god of heaven amen has come down among you and i hallelujah he's gathering of people from around the world that's actually the evidence and they're and they actually can that revives us hallelujah jacob jacob's spirit was revived i'm a son of abraham god's in control of my life this was all predestinated by god god is displaying himself in this my son's actually alive i don't have to live in this nothing could comfort him until the evidence that his son was alive awakened him again and it's the same thing with you i pray to god if we have trauma in our lives if we have hurt in whatever way we look and see the wagons we look and see the evidence of heaven we you know by faith we see his spirit moving among us touching our lives and it revives us hallelujah that that we don't have to sure the pain is real sure the loss is real the hurt but you know we don't have to let it let it define us amen we let the overcoming power of god define us i mean that's that's really what we should have and then i believe that's what we do have hallelujah where god has sent a word you know you know brother bram said about rebecca and the camels where where where she would water the camels of eleazar and brother ram said you know the very the very power yeah because the animal in the bible represents a power the very power that she was watering was going to pack a terror isaac and the same holy spirit that's here among us so we water with praise and thanksgiving and worship amen is going to pack us to our isaac one day hallelujah so amen i'm so glad that we we can look and we say we have the evidence amen of his goodness all over our lives hallelujah amen hallelujah now brother brown just drops us in and and someone can enlighten me where this oil is but i i find this interesting brother brown said in 1951 and the angel lord he said now you remember a church that you're living in the best day that you'll that you've ever will live in right now until jesus comes he says it shall gradually not gradually but rapidly get worse and worse when russia goes down there to get that oil look out that's all she needs that's what the prophet said it would do and we're ready for it then so church get ready to meet christ he's sending great revivals and meetings and stirring the full gospel people signs and wonders appearing everywhere great wonders to draw his people together and one day he shall come the deliverer now what i love about that is he just drops that in but he says when this is going on amen the church is being prepared by god to leave hallelujah he says there's great stirs there's great revivals there's meetings and stirring of the full gospel people signs and wonders appearing everywhere you know we are the full gospel people we believe the whole world and what has god been doing he's been sending his spirit great stirrings great meetings what happened over easter god came god came upon the scene stirred up the people i mean getting you ready getting you prepared more and more as that day's approaching hallelujah so i'm so glad that we are his handiwork amen we're not our own amen i think we should have greater confidence in our lord now than ever before if that you can but you combine every day of your life this moment right now you should have greater confidence in him compared to all the days of your life amen because our god is great hallelujah so we need to we need to keep that spirit of revival among us he says and he says in the easter seal in 1965 says now this is this is your own life this is my life it's where if it isn't the truth what i'm fixing to say that i'm one of the most foolish people in the world i've given my life for something there's nothing to and so have you but if it is the truth then i owe everything that i am i are everything i could be to the cause of which we're standing for and i think that we must never lose our enthusiasm you say well that's just an emotional workup no no brother the prophet tells us after the seal is open we should never lose our enthusiasm we should never lose our vibrancy and our excitement i mean the lord should excite us hallelujah he says as we see easter approaching it's just does something down in me i know that that's the day that the thing was sealed forever in the sight of god now we notice it's the same spirit that raised him from the grave that is dwelling in us now how could that be the spirit that raised up god jesus from the dead has has dwelling in us now now it is the spirit that quickens it's not the word that quickens it's the spirit that quickens the word or gives the word life it gives it wings to fly gives it access it's the spirit that does it so it's now the spirit that comes upon the people causing the word to live amen and that's what remember that's god's doing it's not even your doing no matter you think god is sovereign so he so it's not parliament in heaven now the government says well yeah we should come to 113 joshua stokes valley because the majority voted no no god chooses god chooses it's not it's not our choice though we may call upon him which we do god has to respond to that call by his own sovereign choosing just like us when god puts in our heart lord i want you i want to meet you where are you you know it's god's sovereign choosing to put that in you to begin with and to respond to that call so aren't you glad god is sovereign he said i'm going to meet you i'm going to change your life i'm going to walk with you amen remember jesus said to his disciples you have not chosen me i've chosen you amen so god's great sovereignty he pours his spirit out upon us to give us access to every divine promise hallelujah because he wants to see that promised word fulfilled in our lives he doesn't just want us to talk about it though that is good he wants to see it manifested in our lives amen so i'm so glad that the anointing is here of the word you know i'm so glad that we don't just worship him in spirit and know a truth or just truth and no spirit we are both amen we have wings to fly not lopsided flopping along like some seagull but an eagle soaring in the heavens amen it gives us access amen it's the spirit that does it now it's so important to keep uh an atmosphere of revival amen remember because you know what happens we have a glorious time and the devil tries to push back i say yeah we should we should expect a counterattack you know he's got a playbook and he sticks to the same playbook no matter what generation so the lord does something and the devil wants to try and steal it from us now we should exploit his counter-attack and then just attack again maybe we should keep pushing forward amen so we should expect oh we've had a tough week who's had a tough week i'll say i've had a tough week i've been up and down and everywhere in here but you know the more the devil fights we're going to realize the more the victory is on its way he's doing his last kick and the okama you know sure he can kick all he wants my god's greater than his kick emma no weapon formed against us shall prosper he has an expiry date you know one of the only first afrikaans words i learned young was frot you know the devil's gone fraud he's gone off you know he's got moldy his expiry date he doesn't want to read his expiry date but he's he's gone off right he has come to his end remember we've come to a time where really time is no more and he you know and he knows his sh his time is short hallelujah but but our time has just begun hallelujah why because we as eternity rolls on we're going to still be i mean but as we go into eternity he's going to come to nothing he's going to be he's going to be annihilated in the lake of fire amen hallelujah so he will kick but we're going to realize no we're informed against us shall prosper i mean we're going to look beyond like jacob if only he you know if only god gave him access to that unseen realm he could say no my son's not dead he's alive this is all part of god's plan though i'm in a lot of pain i miss him i want to see him you know but but this is all working out for my good he said how could 22 years of brokenness be for his good well it was for his good it preserved his life all that to happen that may seem a bit far-fetched but if we just look beyond lord jesus help us look beyond and and and realize this is working out for my good amen amen so he said now i remember so this is this is a calling jesus on the scene 1964 he says now i remember one night in in vandalia illinois walking into the meeting and had been no more in the meeting over five minutes he wasn't a feeble person around the place anywhere wheelchairs pushed out and piled up blind was seeing deaf and dumb speaking and just simply it the spirit of god was present and he just healed the whole group of them now that's when you can do something when revival's going but let the revival fire die down then you can hardly the people are still christians but they're not revived into that spirit that great atmosphere that does something it's just like in a forge in a blacksmith shop where you've got to get the iron hot before you can pound it on the anvil if you don't you'll never straighten it out and that's what it takes to have revival if everyone is under the heat of the holy spirit that's brought down the powers of god and a revival moving then there is prayer meetings going day and night every minute every year why the people wouldn't even leave the grounds i mean so he's saying that when the spirit of revival leaves it doesn't mean the people are lost it doesn't mean they weren't believers they're still christians but they're not they're not revived into that spirit that great atmosphere that does something so we can drop out of revival but that doesn't mean we're not overcomers it doesn't mean we're not believers right right it just means that spirit that the devil has well god has allowed him to come into our lives where god wants to use that to make us stronger but the devil uses that wounding aiming to pull us out of that spirit of revival but we can go through the same motions we can read the same quotes we can read the same scriptures sing the same songs and but yet we're still christians but yet be out of that spirit of revival i want you to notice brother brown said these things after the seals came open right yeah and he said it i just say a lot of things like brother danny steven he says well someone asked him well when did brother brown say that and he just said well when he was a prophet he said that so you know but some people like that kind of thing but you know let's say saying that we must never lose our enthusiasm we've got to stay in the spirit of revival you say well that's just healing revival with god does that we have more than just a healing revival we have divine healing meetings every service i don't know if you've realized but we have we have healing meetings every service we have deliverance meetings every service amen it's all the time hallelujah because it's just part of the word and we we believe the full word don't we i mean but we want to be in such a way in that spirit of revival where we can be shaped and molded into the image of the word right where god where our hearts are so full of love that doesn't matter how the word comes it may cut us in half but yet praise god and he moulds and shapes us into what he wants us to be hallelujah so i'm so glad we can stay in the spirit of revival i'm so glad that we can if we don't feel in revival we can get back into it amen that the devil has got nothing on us he's got nothing on us amen he's a defeated being we've got to really you know we're going to call him for what he is i really um so um brother tim pruitt had a have their easter camp their youth camp and there's one where it's just skits and then one of the skits you should go watch it but it's but it's a a court trial there's the believers god's the judge and there's the devil and you know they're having a go and you know and what i love is is it's all real testimonies that the young people are sharing about healing and deliverance but man you should hear them talk to the devil you know they they really put him in his place it's not a well mr devil if i have time can i please no no they tell him satan you heard me bound last camp but i'm free amen there was sickness in my family now they're healed you put that on my mama that of that cancer but now it's gone and all these things they they're just having a real go maybe because it's something physical that they could just but you know we we have the right by the blood of jesus christ to tell the devil where to go and where to stay it's not a please would you mind is no satan you're a defeated being you have no right to afflict me you have no right to trouble me you have no right to try and put this on me get out of the name of jesus christ i'm sick of you hanging around here i'm sick of this deadbeat atmosphere because of you being here get out in the name of jesus christ and i'll tell you this if you've just given your life to god two seconds ago you have that authority to put him in his place i mean it's not something now i've got to obtain something no by the blood of jesus christ you have every right to say satan get out in jesus christ's name we do not have to put up with his dead feelings we have to put up with any any of his deadness coldness you know this is not a freezer this is a furnace hallelujah so i think we should just rejoice and just say satan get out he will come he will try and come back because he's a creature of habit amen but i want to be you know i i think i heard brother donnie reagan say this i really like it you know i want to be such a believer that when satan sends a certain import devil against me that devil begs for mercy i don't want to go to his house i've got such a beating have you seen the scars that cast a still on my leg don't send me to those people please whatever you do what have i done wrong please i want to be that kind of person you know i don't want to be that kind of person where the devil says go get that guy and the guy and he says well it's going to be a working holiday this is going to be easy you know i don't want to be that kind of christian i want to be i want to be the kind of christian that the devil is dragged kicking and screaming against me amen why because our god lives hallelujah amen that's how we should be amen so so that just going back to solomon and joshua so that same you say commission was given to be strong and very courageous don't be dismayed there'll be times when we are dismayed who's had those times i've had those times you don't know how you're ever going to get through it but you know you just you know it's like your morale is just shot you kind of what's even the point how can i go on but yet there's something in you says you can that's a lot just keep going on amen you know if we burn every bridge there's nothing to go back to if there's no exit ramp you've burnt every bridge here i am here i stand amen then you can keep pressing on i mean but it's the lord that will keep us pressing on amen now what i love about so it's very interesting well i find this is my me my little mind joshua's talking to god and god says keep all the word i don't know what it what was going through his mind i don't know what he was thinking so do i need to keep this feast or i mean i mean which part of the word do i need to keep you know i mean keep all the word but where do i begin and but i i think it's a lot more simple than that because jesus would come and and he would be he would speak first to the devil in matthew 4 where where the great temptation came and um and then he said you know because you know the devil wanted him to make bread take the stones make it into bread so he could eat but then but then the lord reached into deuteronomy and says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god and then jesus would make it even more simple because we have a lot of word right the pharisees would come because he had put the sadducees to silence this is in matthew 23 and then one of them asked which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him saying master which is the great commandment in the law which is the great one so humanly people will emphasize certain parts of the word they enjoy the most because we're human right some people you know so some people will if it's just now this is just carnal understanding because all revelation actually expresses one person the lord jesus christ if it's knowledge it's all disconnected thoughts so someone in their carnality might emphasize serpent seed more or they might emphasize revelations 5 more or the cross more in their carnality but if if they have a revelation they'll see all of those things are actually expressing one person well how is serpent's head express god well it tells me i'm a son of god right it's not just you know all about cain's line everything i know because when you read down the lineage of adam it says then man began to call upon the name of the lord there's not that phrase in cain's lineage it's only in adam's lineage so if god put something into me to call upon his name maybe you don't know where the answer is but there's something in you saying there's more to life law what is there when we die what's life all about that's actually calling upon the name of the lord you may not know his name as jesus at the time but he will show himself to you so to me it just shows that i'm a son of god praise the lord we know it explains the blood covenant all those things you know virgin birth all those things but to me it shows me that i'm a son of god now so so he's asked the question what is the great commandment in the lord jesus said unto him if thou love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and all i know thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets that means to the whole sort of so to keep the whole word is to love the lord thy god with all the heart with all our soul all thy mind and and to love thy neighbor as thyself it's all encapsulated five books of moses are encapsulated in two phrases hallelujah because if you think about it if you love the law with all that you are you'll be a true living worshiper right and the second is thou shalt love thy neighbor as ourselves as you love the lord with all that you are all carnality has to go all human understanding all all carnality now we are all built differently so i'm not talking about our personalities will go you know i said it a while ago i said i'll still be me up in heaven there weren't many gay men's but that was fine but you know i'll still be me armand will still be armand could be will still be ben christine will still be christine we'll still we'll still all be our personalities because god made us a certain way he we he's not a cookie cutter we're all different right but he says that the second one is thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself so so what i mean by that is to take out all carnality it does not mean that that our personalities go okay amen and so the second is thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself so if you love your neighbor as yourself now notice he does not say thou shalt love thy neighbor that you enjoy to be around as i self thou shall love thy good neighbor thou shalt love thy rich neighbor thou shall love thy generous neighbor as thyself you know he does not say any of that you thou shall love thy day but you enjoy or thou shalt love the brother or sister you enjoy the best that you click the most with as thyself no thy neighbor you know some neighbors are good neighbors some neighbors of bad neighbors some neighbors you wish you never had neighbors but they are all and i'm talking about the world now you know so so but you are called to love that person irrespective of who they are what they say what they do nationality whatever age whatever you know as yourself so now if you treat now you think now how do i want to be treated do i want to be kicked down do i want to be told i'll never make it do i want to be told you know what's the point in trying with you do you want to be told those things do you want to be told there's no he's a hopeless case do you want to be told what's the point they've gone too far they'll never get it they'll never there's no way that god can ever reach them they're they're unhelpable they're unlovable i don't want to be treated like that i want to be treated there's a rapture for you i want to be treated you're welcome here i want to be treated that you're a vital part of this body i want to be treated that that no one can take your place no one can take your place you are absolutely essential in god's economy that's how i want to be treated i want to be treated that the blood has cleansed me from all sin honorably honorary treated that my past has been forgot forgiven and forgotten that's how i want to be treated hallelujah only treated that though i fall someone will pick me up though i fail though i'll be forgiven and i'll be picked up though i say the wrong thing my personality just grates everyone like a cheese grater yet yet they're still grace for me i want to be treated that they're still understanding for me i want to be treated that i'm not just cut off because well yeah that guy you know that's how i want to be treated i want to be treated that i'm not used or abused or manipulated that's how i want to be treated so you've got to love your neighbor as yourself you know unfortunately some people don't love themselves they think they're worthless they think they're useless they think they'll never get anywhere where does that come from i do not read in the bible that we are in that condition god's covenant with me there's nothing in it that says i'm useless i'm worthless i'll never get anywhere maybe in the niv not inspired version if you read a different version of the bible that's fine but you know maybe it may be a man's opinion they will say that but that's not in that's not in god's covenant with me hallelujah so if if if you have in your mind that you're useless you're worthless you're you're a waste of you're using up someone else's oxygen that's the devil lying that is the devil lying to you you say well what's the point of my life there's a point there's a point to express redemption to the earth there's a point that this open word will become manifested in you there's a point that jesus christ will be made flesh in your life there's a point that you'll walk with god and will be not because god will take you that's the point of your life there's a point that you'll be a light to this dying world that's the point amen that you're an attribute of god you'll be manifested upon the earth that's the point of your life you say well it's pretty hard at the moment just keep going just keep walking just keep walking say lord send your wagons send the evidence to revive me hallelujah send the evidence amen send your spirit oh god i'm hearing broken hearted and dare i don't know the way out but send your wagons i want to look beyond the curtain of time i mean to see everything's going to be okay you know you know if god struck your heart everything is okay you know if god has changed your life everything's okay you say well he hasn't done much for me but has he put something in in you that you want him that is a supernatural act of god because my bible tells me that no no one seeks after him not one the apostle paul's in the in the book of romans so if there's something in he says i want you lord that's god that's god that's a deep calling to the deep where'd that deep come from not from your humanity not from your upbringing though it may be a good upbringing but it's from god god put that in there before the foundation of the world and here you are there's something lord there's a hunger there's a longing there yo i may fail i may be a terrible believer but there's a longing hallelujah and the prophet asked well it's like a fish you know what was there first the water or the fin well the water was there then the fin on the fish is back so if there's a deep air there's a deep there first calling to the deep i mean it says heaven was calling he put it in here heaven was there first he put this calling that you would connect hallelujah amen so now everything's actually all right amen hallelujah because we're all said and done i know where i'm ending up in the back of the book hallelujah hallelujah i'm rejoicing on streets of gold amy well what about this what's going on in time well remember this is not the end of the story remember brother kaido stood here i think the second service we had upstairs and he preached a service to be continued hey man he preached to me continue he says he says you come to an end of a drama and and you know used to be on tv you know they have half an hour episodes they come to the end and there's some dramatic scene and say to be continued what's going to happen next week you know but that's like our life that's like our life there's always a you know the devil thinks now's the end but god says to be continues hallelujah and then we can just rejoice because god has the final say amen hallelujah if jacob could only see god has the final say amen but i'm so glad god revived him his spirit revived amen now that word revived because i i was i was i think well i was googling in the bible program you know revival revive and you know different different words and this is the first time that the word revive is used and it means now to live it means to to to make alive it means to quicken it means to recover it means to repair it means to restore to life it means to be whole amen so so when someone's revived amen they are repaired they are quickened they are restored and they're made whole amen and what is god doing in this end time he's repairing he restoring amen he's reviving he's making whole hallelujah and that's why the spirit of god comes because we could ever we're going gonna had the worst week of our life and we could be broken like jacob was fainted just just there downcast nothing can comfort you but then the spirit of god comes because he sees you and says no no you're gonna go through this trial but i'm gonna take you through the trial i'm not going to leave you there this is not the end of your life this is not your status quo for the rest of your life this this this way you're on right now is going to come to an end hallelujah remember we go into a trial but we come out the other side hallelujah jacob was 22 years in the trial but he came out hallelujah amen so so but that's why the spirit of god that's why sunday you know i love that you know we may be in friday but sunday's coming just like jesus he was dead in the tomb on friday but sunday's coming a resurrection is coming amen a new dawn is coming a new season is coming hallelujah so we could be maybe friday in the tomb but sunday is coming maybe it's just a few hours and it's gonna be a whole different picture oh my i love it yeah i see the brother andy after his service that john 20 is my like my favorite favorite bit there there's a picture in um yeah the girls got this picture bible there's just this picture of of mary and she turns and she sees the lord oh look and i was showing someone that once one day and the spirit of god just came down into the house i said that's what it's about you've got to look just like he said you look from from the pain and despair and look to where the lord is why because friday mary was brokenhearted she saw the lord die she was in desp she was so broken this is my master i love him he set me free and look what they're doing to him but sunday's coming hallelujah sunday's coming i mean she needed her she needed a reviving she needed a reviving and who came and revived her the revival himself oh the lord himself said i'm not going to leave you in this condition i'm going to revive you i'm going to awaken you i'm going to repair you i mean that you can go from being broken hearted to rejoicing i mean you can go from being sad and downcaster glad and happy and free hallelujah to realize now you know what i love jesus words to her touch me not for i get to ascend to my father and to your father to my god and your god hallelujah so he he's telling mary we have a father in heaven we're actually family hallelujah hallelujah and what does the lord say to us he's our father he's our father we're his children hallelujah but then she turns and then she sees him what happens her spirit revives why because she gets an awakening i actually am a daughter of god he told me no one else told me he told me hallelujah it's the same thing with us i trust when god came to you and said you're actually my child amen it's not you trying to be my child you actually are my child it doesn't matter the mistakes the quirks and your personality whatever things you're wrestling with no it goes beyond that it goes beyond that to that seed in your soul where god says no you are my son you're my daughter and he can't you he can't get rid of his family hallelujah he can't change his mind about any of us amen if we're a son or daughter of god he can't change his mind we're his child that's it hallelujah so she was repaired she was restored i mean she was revived she was made whole amen by the spirit of our lord by god himself calling her by name mary hallelujah amen trust you can remember that moment in your life amen hallelujah now if we can just come here but okay hallelujah now our lord jesus is is a supreme deity this may i'm sure this is not news to any one of us but we are not being we are not serving some lesser god we are not serving a god we are not serving part of god but we are serving the very lord of glory the fullness of god here bodily dwelt in him i mean all that god was he poured into christ all that was poured into christ is poured into the church amen so now we're not serving now we're not serving just an idea we're serving the creator god himself jehovah god i mean we're serving the one who made heavens and earth he's the one who's called us he's the one who will keep us now brother brahm says it in a few places in his in his ministry he says now he says don't be afraid to trust it i see as he says now all around through the building tonight i'll say this morning if the lord jesus has risen from the dead and i've told you the truth and god is obligated to his word to make it so see he says don't be afraid to trust it it's either the bible is the truth or it's not the truth if it isn't the truth it's the biggest deceiver that was ever written for it's got millions deceived i've stood any time with the crown on one hand the bible and the other before the mohammedans and say one is right and the other is wrong let god the real god speak don't be afraid he'll never forsake he'll never leave now the lord jesus when he was here on earth the works that he did which we've just quoted he promised that he would come again before the end of time and would do the same things he said i that he would do it through his church now he said i'm the vine you're the branches now the vine doesn't bear fruit the branches bear fruit now if a if it's a pumpkin vine it'll be a pumpkins if it's a watermelon vine it'll be a watermelons if it's a cantaloupe vine it'll be a cantaloupe it's a grapevine it'll bear grapes if it's a christian vine it'll be a christ the life of christ the works of christ then our spirits have to be energized by something i mean so so our spirits are not energized by intellectual ideas of man they are not they're not energized by social norms our spirits are energized by the spirit of almighty god hallelujah you know brother brown would use this all through his ministry too i had a look you know where where he would he would relate the story when a woman from the christian science church would come to him after he preached and said you know i love the preaching but there's one thing i've got against you and brother i said well one thing i'm thankful for that and she says your problem is is that you make jesus divine and brotherhood says but he is divine but she says no he couldn't be divine she said you believe the bible i said i do she said look i'll prove to you by your own bible that he cannot be divine he was just merely a man a good man and then so she you know and then and then um um and then he says and then she says i don't want to hurt your feelings because christ died it was christian science you see said now your healings and things i believe in that every bit but she said you make jesus to be divine and by the way says why he's either divine or the biggest deceiver the world ever had see i said it was either god or he was nothing see and she said oh my mr branham he couldn't be divine and and he said well i want your scripture and he went to the short and she sorry i went to the shorter scripture in the bible and john 11 says jesus wept see he can't be he can't be divine because he wept at the tomb of lazarus and then brother ram said well you know your argument is shallower than a supra broth made out of a chat of a chicken that half starved to death because right after right after he wept he went to the tomb and cried out lazarus come forth amen so there was the man part speaking there was the god part speaking he says he absolutely was divine amen you know he was you know there on the cross he cried out i thirst but on easter morning he broke the seals of hell death and the grave and ascended up triumphant he was more than a man he was he that was god in the man that's right and the same one lives in us tonight as a spirit of the holy ghost yes sir now brother ram says the greatest of all revelations now the reason i'm going down this way is because if we can really just keep on our hearts the one who has found us the one who has called us the one who speaks to us the one who guides us the one who is leading us through life and we just keep that on our heart it's not a church guiding us it's not even a prophet if i could say it that way that's guiding us it's not man's opinion that's guiding us it's not our own enthusiasm that's guiding us it's the lord jesus christ the word himself guiding us amen says the god who made all things is guiding us because remember he is the revival giver hallelujah so he says the greatest of all revelations is the deity the supreme deity of our lord jesus christ he says you can't get the first base until you believe that amen when peter said repent and then and then see the deity be baptized in the middle of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and then you're ready to go in the spirit the first thing you know they have to know is the deity of christ i'm alpha omega i'm the a to z there's no more but me i was at the beginning i'll be at the end i'm he that was which is is to come the almighty think of it that's the one that's what the trumpet said that's in revelations 1. so the greatest revelation really is the supreme deity of jesus christ amen now jesus was not hated for being a religious or a man or a prophet or a teacher from god that was not what caused the people to kill him because even even nicodemus would come and say you know you're a teacher come from god we know that that didn't cause him to gather a mob and try and kill him but when he came down to a place and said i and my father are one that is that is what caused the great persecution of the lord because he says i and my father are one then they go to pick up stones again to stone them but then they say but but yeah but then he says but many a good work i've showed of you of my father which one of these do you stone me then then they said the jews answered him this is john 10 33 saying for a good work we stone thee not but for bless me and because thou being a man maketh thyself god so so when he said i am my father one i knew exactly what he was meaning this man is claiming to be god in the flesh but that yo that was the that was the big complaint that's what caused the crucifixion of our lord right what was the what's the biggest complaint against brother brown he makes jesus christ god he says he says he says he's the supreme deity he's not just part of the godhead he is the godhead that's such a big complaint people cannot stand that but what i love about sunday is where thomas no no sorry this is after the resurrection sunday thomas thomas would say unless i see the holes in his hands and his feet aside i'll not believe unless i put my fingers in and things and then when the lord appears to him you know and he and then and then he says to thomas put your finger in my side different things thomas says unto him my lord and my god see it a revelation this is not just his law but it's his god in the flesh amen this is the supreme deity right here i mean to open his eyes hallelujah amen matthew 28 jesus would say all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go therefore and teach all nations baptizing in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even until the end of the world he says amen now we know that name that one name is the name of the lord jesus christ which is the name above every name amen it is not just a name that's why it's such a curse word in the earth is because there's power in that name there's no power in the name of muhammad there's no power in the name of buddha but there's power in the name of jesus christ amen there is supreme power in that name now that's why the devil loves to try and use it as a curse word because he knows because it says in philippians that that that that name is given above every name and that everything is going to bow in heaven and earth and under the other is going to bow to that name the devil's going to bow in the name of jesus christ i mean one day in a supreme way but in our lives he has to bow to that name hallelujah when we realize that it's not that that our god how incredible it is you know you know there's overcomers out of every age and and i'm just going to close with i'm going to read it quote two more scriptures then then we're done there's overcomers in every age we're called to be part of that group hallelujah god's made us to be part of that group when john saw the saw the vision of the church um you know the book of revelation and and he would write the letter to the latest in church age god just said the overcomer him that overcometh will sit in my throne as i've sat down in my father's throne so they're going to sit in my kingdom that's what it means to sit in my throne they're going to sit down in my kingdom hallelujah so so so he just wrote down he that overcometh but in god's mind he had your name there he already had your name there you were associated with that verse in god's mind that's why in this day and age right now you're overcoming glory you may be in the midst of the biggest battle of your life but you're gonna overcome remember never give up never give up never give up never surrender never retreat it's charge i mean i only know one one bugle note charge not retreat not hold fire fire hallelujah charge amen why because we are actually part we are part of that great group you think about it okay well how how we overcome as well there came a time in your life where the world overcame you yep unbelief overcame you trouble you know just the world but then the lord gave you faith to rise up above it so what happened now now you've overcome it because it doesn't overcome you so now if you've overcome that part you're going to overcome the next part because you're actually built to be an overcomer that's like david david was built to be king so the lion came along well who died not david the bear came along who died not david goliath came along who died not david where did he end up on the throne because he was built to be on the throne amen as as a little shepherd boy before that it was in him to be king god anointed that seed and it became to life and then so what was in him became manifested hallelujah why because he was built to be king amen we are built to be overcomers it's just our nature it's what we do hallelujah amen but then we also got to recognize that the one in us has already overcome all things hallelujah i love this is one of my favorite quotes from how can i overcome he says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks hallelujah lots of people say there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that that's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real so you're going to recognize your enemies real he's really it's not a figment of your imagination it's not having a mood swing or a bad thought as the devil it's a real he's a real creature you must know he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's a devil he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him hallelujah so sickness comes trouble comes god doesn't scratch his head and say now how is this going to work i've never faced this problem before this is this is this is something new he never looks at the devil that way says no no i've already taken care of this i've already overcome this it was you know same you know i've been here before i've been here before i've dealt with him before and here i come again hallelujah he's already overcome amen now so you must recognize that the god in you is greater than mighty than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you're more than a match for him amen you know i love grace grace is an enablement to do the word hallelujah so his grace that god's grace is upon us amen to overcome that's real overcoming when you recognize you look back and say i'm going to do this i'm going to do that no no you're defeated but there's no condemnation in them which are in christ jesus that walk after the flesh so that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you recognize that you've overcome and you know he's a devil you can't say i've got sickness and i i don't believe it's a sickness oh yes it's a sickness your cancer you say i don't believe it's a cancer it's a cancer it's a cancer but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you must realize that the holy spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing so whatever your problem is right now put in that category of this thing so the holy spirit in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him he says that's exactly sensible that's exactly the way the scripture is written he says overcoming hallelujah now i'm going to read i'm going to read can you put this up can you put up psalms 145 verse 8 and then we're going to go to ephesians chapter 2 then we're going to close i just want to read these two things because when you realize that the mercy of god is over your life it's not his wrath it's not his judgment it's his mercy is upon you oh my just should just revive us no matter where we are his mercy's upon me i can be in the deepest ditch though the worst spot of my life but his mercy is on me hallelujah i mean do we have psalms 145 and i just like to read it all together maybe you can turn there as well i saw this up i think it was uh oh no it was um yeah rfbf had had had this up when um yeah before by the youth without borders i trust you've been watching them if you haven't go back and watch them amen praise the lord we thank god for those meetings he says the lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great mercy now verse 9 is the one i really want to get to the lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works all thy work shall praise you o lord of thy saints shall bless thee she says his tender mercies are over all his works now maybe just to save time but in ephesians 2 and 10 it says for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them so if we're his workmanship his tender mercies are over us amen he's there guiding us nurturing us keeping us sustaining us because his mercy what are you living under i'm living under the mercy of god the mercy of god is upon me his tender mercies are upon me amen hallelujah so you say well you know if we could just just just take stock take stock of life now i'm not talking about how much money you have how much you don't what you'd like what whatever i'm not talking about those things take stock of life what is that well then well then okay let's take stock the one who made heavens and earth the very lord of glory the one who said let there be and the sun moon and stars the one who actually created the wasted to destroy the one who prophesied that there will be a new heavens and new earth the one who said that sin is going to be done away with the one who purchased our salvation on calvary the one who's been gathering a bride through seven church ages the one who's come down in this end time to gather a people for a rapture him has put his tender mercy upon me he has taken me and said you are my workmanship you may not known it for a long time but there came a time where you realized i'm god's workmanship and if his tender mercy is upon me you know i think i think it's with abraham it says well god is blessed shall be blessed amen so if god has called you you're blessed amen you are blessed and what god has blessed shall be blessed and god cannot reverse his blessing hallelujah so i'm so thankful for his tender mercies upon us amen but i pray that today we'll just look and we'll see the wagons coming like jacob did and the spirit revived aren't you glad god sends a parent to the church it's actually heaven reaching down to get a hold of us saying you're coming you're coming it's going to be okay i'm in i've taken care of it all i'm going to take you to another world amen let's have the musicians please this morning if you come forward amen the lord's great amen amen so let's keep the spirit of revival among us amen i mean maybe we should um stan let's sing that song um no no the um that's that song uh the goodness of god i have lived in the goodness of god amen for your mercies never fail me all of my days have been held in your hand amen i love you for your mercies never fails me all of my days i've been held in your hands from the moment that i wake up until i lay my head i will

running after us lord we know in the lord jesus in the word father that goodness and mercy lord that lord that chases after us so god follows us all the days of our life lord we know that follow is

great grace to fall in love with you lord you wound us to your side and we say here we are lord jesus fathers want to pray for each one here lord may you revive us like never before father may we

up brother anas he's got a special but he's also going to sing the song with me first then he doesn't know what it is [Music] we're gonna sing my song and then we're gonna sing your song okay okay all right [Music] like a man's hand [Music] or i see a cloud like [Music] [Music] the children of [Music] is a tiny cloud is rising from the sea and they began to understand at the time [Music] is is [Applause] and i know [Music] is [Music] i know [Music] [Music] i [Music] very afraid of love [Music] has already [Music] [Music] yes is [Music] yes i [Music] like a [Music] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] i didn't know his song he doesn't know my song anyway you know this song there is not a friend like the lord jesus amen it's a bit strange after the meetings i did enjoy the meetings and then the devil was dead he really attacked he really came for me amen he stayed up troubles at work my wife lost her older sister amen when we were coming to work to church when we were coming to church today uh she had a really severe backache she couldn't even sit you know it was really severe it attacked my daughter as well so i had a choice to turn back home or to continue to the service so i decided we go to the services now so that's why we came here amen now it reminds me reminds me of a boxing match amen so there are rules that you have to follow in a boxing match when you get knocked down they start counting as long as you hit the canvas you're on your back one two three when they get to 10 and you are not up you have lost it they ring the bell then whoever knocked you down has one it doesn't matter if you are leading in the points but if you get knocked and you don't rise up after 10 if they get to 10 you are out so when i stepped in church i hadn't even thought of singing a special i just came in we came in late when brother bo sisters episode here starting to sing that's when i thought of singing but it was in this song but i didn't come prepared to sing just think about singing and i had chosen another song and brother isaac didn't call me he did look at when a man came but he didn't call me now i understand why he didn't because we were meant to sing this one here now on sunday morning just before the song service i opened my bible randomly but i had been thinking of this scripture this scripture kept coming about elijah is actually first kings chapter 18 verse 40. so i opened my bible and it went directly to this to this song so in my bible in the king james it's just right at the top at the corner where it says the lord he is god the lord he is god and then it goes to when elijah led all those prophets of bowel he says don't let any one of them escape so he led them to the brook kildren and he killed them all and after that this is strange that they'd been in a drought for three and a half years but elijah says ahab get uprise and it for i hear the sound of abundance of rain so i have read that scripture before but it never struck me so he is killed there's been a showdown he has killed the prophets of baal and then he says i hear the sound of abundance of rain what touches me about this scripture is that there is no sign anywhere of a cloud he just tells ahab get in your chariot rise and eat because i hear the sound of abundance of rain and then after that he starts praying right and then he sends gazing seven says go on up the mountain and look beyond the sea and tell me what you see rain is coming but yeah goes up the mountain he looks towards the sea there's no sign of rain there's no cloud there but elijah said i hear the sound of abundance of rain i don't think anyone else there had anything but the prophet is saying i hear the sound of abundance of rain chaos comes down says i don't see anything there's nothing there and he was saying the truth because he had been told go up and check and tell me what you say so he comes gives a report there is nothing i don't see anything he says go back up again saw this man seven times going up the mountain he must have been worried is is this man still sane i'm telling him there is nothing over the sea go back the third time he must have been kissing and grumbling then the seventh time he says i see a cloud the size of a man's hand i was given that scripture on sunday morning now i come on sunday the song says i see a cloud the size of a man's hand someone out there is waiting for blessings if you were not waiting for blessings how else do you want god to talk to you that's how god speaks you are waiting for a blessing and he says hey it's there it's coming elijah says i hear the sound of abundance of rain gas doesn't see it but when he saw a cloud and then it didn't end there elijah says okay now get in your chariot this is not the normal rain this is serious rain you got a right now fast to jezreel because if you are caught in this rain it's gonna flood and everything so [Music] i have gas in the chariot and he said shall we give you a lift come on elijah come on he says no don't worry about me just get in the chariot and get to jezreel don't worry about me i'll find my way to jezreel and you know what happened how i think that man is the officially the one that holds the 100 meter recorder it's not usain bolt it's elijah it's elijah it's not written down but it's elijah who holds the record because the bible says he ran faster he overtook the horses and the chariots how fast was that men running how fast was that man running to overtake horses and chariots ab looked he says i've never seen anything like this the man just tricked past shh i see a cloud the size of a man's hand reason i wanted to sing was to tell the devil i'm still standing they knocked me down they started counting but before they go to 10 i was still up i'm up i just wanted to tell the devil i'm still in the battle he can't defeat me i'm still in the battle that's why i want to sing this song there is not a friend like the lowly jesus whatever you're passing through we have a friend you take care of everything just talk to jesus amen [Music] there's not a friend like the lord lay jesus no not one no not one there's no real friend like the love we have this song can i have it no not one no one none else could heal all the souls diseases no not one no lord one jesus knows all about our struggles he will guide the day he's done there's not a friend like that love no no no [Music] no no one now i wanna sing it slowly there is no difference jesus no not one no no one none else could heal all our souls diseases no not one no lord one jesus knows all about my [Music] [Applause] [Music] no no no one no not one [Music] hey can i have the next place so continue when i finish and i go to the chorus let me have the next no friend like him is so hard and holy no no no [Music] no [Music] jesus knows all about your struggles he will guide you to the day [Music] not one there is no enough that he's not near us no not one no no no one no night so dark but his love can see you no not one known what jesus knows all about my struggles he will guide me to the day he's done is no difference like my lowly no no no one no no was every gift like a savior given no not one no no no one will he refuse as evil in heaven no not one no no jesus [Music] all about my struggles he will guide me to the day he's done this not a friend like the lowly jesus no not one no quotas again jesus knows all about our struggles he will guide us till the day he's done [Music] a friend like my love no no no no one no no [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise lord let's just pray this morning heavenly father we know that there is no friend like you lord and you're the only friend that we actually really need lord we know that in this life you do bless us on our walk with believers and different parts of our lives lord but ultimately you're the one friend that you're the only friend that we need lord and if we've got you as a friend we have all that we need well what a friend we have in jesus we just thank you for the word that we've heard this morning we thank you lord for the refreshing of our souls lord we thank you for faith that was preached to our hearts order we believe it with all of our heart lord and we want to lay hold upon eternal life lord we want to lay hold upon all the good things of you and just claim all of the land law that you've promised to us may may there be no unbelief amongst us lord not that that's the bad thing about that is that it holds us back lord that it holds us back from from becoming all we can be a new lord so we just want to rebuke any unbelief or any feeling like we can't do it any lies lord that satan tells us that we can't do it we want to rebuke those lord may they be exposed when we when when they come up in any situation in their lives may it be exposed to what it is may satan's lives be exposed so we can move forward in your name lord we just pray and we just pray bless this afternoon in jesus wonderful name amen praise the lord you are dismissed in jesus name amen let's do that song do it a little bit higher you're dismissed if you understand worship you can't give me an a flat minor come on man i see a cloud like a man's head [Music] i see a cloud like a man's hand [Music] i see a cloud like [Music] like a man's hand [Music] like a man's head [Music] [Applause] i see [Music] the children of god began to reason why he said go look now they opened up the door the seventh time they look once for the tiny clouds is rising from the sea and they begin to understand the time for

oh [Music] it is [Music] it really um ah yeah the lord is so good but i just want to share a quick testimony i just sat down in the service this morning feeling really good after awesome prayer meeting and awesome services and then as i sat down i had this pain that went through my back and i haven't had it before and it went sort of into my abdomen and it was like it became so overwhelming that i had to leave the service and set out the back for a few minutes because it was going to make me you know you feel like you're going gonna faint just that nauseous pain so painful and um i just wanted to share because then sister chantelle came out and she said do you want me to pray for you i said yes like you always want prayer right and so i said yes please pray for me and so she just prayed and said lord may she even just get up and be well come back into the service and just rejoice and so i was like lord i receive that i don't feel it but i receive that and i love what brother only has said you know you get up again so that means you're gonna you're winning even if you're not feeling it so i sat down and kind of moving a bit in church very very sore brother oniya stood up and he said about his wife and daughter with the back pain and he's sharing that testimony and just keep getting up and i'm like lord thank you i got up and instantly it was gone not one bit of pain now the whole service so um i know that the lord can do the same thing i mean he's a miracle-working god and it's a yeah it's a small yeah but i'm just wondering maybe um can we all just pray for sister barbara and her daughter as well if that's okay amen brother isaac come up yeah so these so what we do in these services like we just dismis we officially dismiss the formalities and then we just carry on having a server so it's any it says the lord leads anything goes so if you've got anything or anything like that let's all come up and pray if you're all still here that means you're part of the second service now [Laughter] that doesn't make us any better than anyone else it just is what it is sister brahma is going to start praying lord jesus i just want to thank you lord if you do it for me [Music] the body feels and the body wants to stand with [Music] is right now i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i look in it
