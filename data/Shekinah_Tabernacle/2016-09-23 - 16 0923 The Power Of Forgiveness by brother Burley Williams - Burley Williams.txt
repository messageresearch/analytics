that we can place because Lord you never let us down you never leave us you never for forsake us than Lord and Lord everything that you do is perfect you never make mistakes Lord you can't rethink nothing your first thought was eternal and your first thought was perfect and Lord that's why we're so thankful that you was thinking of us that we was in your mind before the foundation of the world we just an Express attribute of you Lord in this day and age that you put us in this age we didn't choose to be in this age you already chose us to be in this age and Lord God you didn't call us in this age to be failures you call us in this age to be Overcomers so father we just want to thank you for that oh God and just pray that you just speak to the heart of your children we ask in the precious name of Jesus Christ and we give you the praise and the church says amen God bless you praise the Lord thank you musicians uh we just uh honored to be here in in Wellington appreciate your pastor but uh being this is my first time meeting him also so we're all I wouldn't say strangers in one way because we're pilgrims and strangers on the face of this Earth we so joining together in this Christian battle aren't we amen so I I really like brother being in spirit and I really think he's a Son of God so we're just happy to be here I would just like to uh let's just read a scripture then will'll let you be seated go to Luke chapter 4 I found it kind of interesting I've been studying all through the day trying to find the mind of the Lord and and I put the scripture down Luke chapter 4 and then when I put it down and then afterwards I heard the the brother singing the song Jesus Set Me Free when I heard the Jubilee I walked free so there was kind of a a little of a confirmation in my heart when I had wrote the scripture down that that's kind of the way the Lord want me to go let's go to Luke chap 4: 18 he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and to recover the sight of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord which actually is the Year of Jubilee amen amen praise the Lord you may be seated tonight my name is burley Williams uh I'm a pastor a fellowship in a little town called peler South Carolina I'm from the south in the United States and uh I've been to New Zealand several times but this is my first time uh being up on this side amen amen amen so uh we just I was telling the other churches I bring you greetings from my church but I don't bring greetings from America cuz there's nothing to greet you from there the only thing God is concerned in America is his bride that is a cursed country it it really is and and I can say that you know sometimes when ministers come from overseas and say things about America American get mad but I'm from America so I can say whatever I want to say about it and uh when they rejected the gospel and uh like the prophet of God said they can raise up all of the uh George Washington's and Ben Franklin it won't do no good she's doomed and uh if Hillary Clinton get the presidency we're in trouble if Donald Trump get it we just in more trouble so either way we it's it's messed up so as a country she's finished so I'm so thankful to know that my nationality might be an American but I'm a Christian so uh I'm so thankful that I'm not even a l of sin we're in the bride age can we say am man some people get offended with that terminology but it's actually is the truth when you are born again you're not all to sin you have been ushered into the bride age and I believe that's what the message come to do to bring us into the bride age amen and so that we could see who we are in this day and this time praise the Lord so we just uh bring you greetings from the church and we just a group of people just trusting in the Lord and waiting on the coming of the Lord and the Lord is doing a lot of wonderful things and we're so thankful for that amen I want to just uh tonight uh I just want to minister on a subject may seem a little strange but I don't think it's strange and uh I actually never preached on this subject before but it just feel like the Lord just really pressing my heart and I just uh begin to look up some scriptures and things and I trust that it'll be a blessing for you I want to minister on the power of forgiveness the power of forgiveness amen so uh I want to read a quote and I'm pretty sure that all of you is familiar with this quote it was about a lady that wanted to get some healing and she kept coming to brother Brandon to get prayed for and get some healing and so forth and she could never get Deliverance until he finally she kept coming back and forth to brother brandham then one day brother brandham was sitting in his office his wife told told him it's that lady again and then at that time when she had came the angel of the Lord had came in the room with brother Brandon and then he said now send her in and then when she went in that room that's when the prophet of God began to tell her things about her life and I'm sure you familiar with the story but I would like to read that story how long do you preach brother how long I got okay so uh sometimes I can be a little rather long winded is that song leader are you a preacher you're an evangelist I can tell soon as I seen him saying I said they got to be a preacher and he got to be an evangelist amen praise the Lord but that's all good I'm going to read this quote and I like to say something uh I've been serving the lord 27 years and uh I come straight to the message out of from the streets I was a thug and but this is all I ever know is the message but you know in my 27 years and uh I've been pastoring 12 years I used to be a full-time evangelist for eight years and uh but through the 27 years I've seen a lot of things I've seen a lot of people come I've seen a lot of people go but you know what I found that a lot of people that walk away from the Lord and walk away from the church and so forth like that I begin to realize a lot of them are not bad people and then when you see them and you run across them in the streets or something and you begin to talk to them and I find and I begin to ask him what happened and when they begin to express some things I find what what hurts a lot of people is things that they hold in their hearts through years and they won't let it go and they won't let proper healing take place and then it surface back up and I find that to be true and many people struggle with letting things go and many people struggle with forgiveness and one thing I learned about when a person don't forgive they could go times and season in their life happy and then for you know they sad again happy and then they sad again because they won't let those things go but there is a power in forgiveness and I believe that with all of my heart you know uh let me just read this quote for you he said when I took her in the room I said all right come on up when people come we just stop everything I got her in the room I sat down and just start talking to her about genealogies and about the beginning the origin of time and everything and watching her it was that same morning God is always there at the crucial moment you know and after a while I looked out there come a vision moving up I seen an automobile going swiftly and this is the prophet of God talking to this woman but look how he started off talking to her about genealogist in beginning of time just talking about the word cuz when you talk about the word that brings God presence on the scene he said I said your condition has something to do with an automobile she said no I never was in a wreck I I I just sit humble said I see you in a car you almost got hit by a train she jumped she said oh I said yes and you're not with your husband you're with another man your husband is overseas and War at that time went ahead and begin to bring it on down I said the things that you done the immoral things you told him about some of it but you didn't tell him about all of it so she feel that she certain things to her husband that she was okay but she had to tell it all can we say praise the Lord how many of you believe that the Lord sent us a messages in this day called total Deliverance not halfway Deliverance but total deliverance and that's what I believe and then he says here and she started screaming holding her face like that I said you're going to have an operation not long ago to for your tonsils and you was afraid to take the anesthetic afraid you could tell that underneath she just screamed and fell on the floor she said that's the truth she said I asked God to forgive me I said you never sinned against God you sinned against your husband and vows I said you go back and make that right then come and I want you to notice he he said you go back and make that right and then when you come he said I can control that demon then that's pretty powerful he said you go to make that right come back to me he said I can control that demon you see what the power of forgiveness and making things right it scripts demons it giv them nothing to hold on to when things is confessed and made right and I said by the way your husband I described how he looked never seen him in my life I said he has got some things to confess to you I said now if you don't believe it call him on the phone and tell him to meet you she went in called him on the phone they met on the road and here they come back tears running down their cheeks he said they forgave one another the demon left her and she was free just because of them forgiving one another it caused that demon to leave and it set them not only her free it set both of them free he said now I might have screened and hollered over that demon and cast everything else and they had never left till that was corrected see you got to find the cause before you can find the Cur amen and I'm believe that we're in the age of release the scripture that we read in here Jesus said I he said I come to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and I believe brothers and sisters another reason why this is so meaningful to me I was dealing with a situation since I've been up here something that I didn't come to expect to deal with but I got into I got in between a quarrel between two Brethren and then I seen the way that it was going and when you see things like that as a minister we supposed to be not only ministers as Christian we supposed to be peacemakers can we say Amen you know sometimes uh we uh like to run from that scripture when you know a brother got a alt against a brother a brother somebody got an AR against you we just a it don't matter just leave it alone forget it but that still don't change the spirit scripture the scripture means exactly what it means so sometimes we have to dig into things that we don't want to dig in and work with things that we don't want to work with but it's all about being set free can we say praise the Lord I don't expect this to be a jumping shout and screaming service but I aim to preach the truth amen because somebody be honest with you brothers and sisters I was telling you Pastor uh I'm Prett I'm I'm pretty I'm pretty bold when it comes to the gospel because I know it's true amen and I and and I know we're living in a time God want our hearts to be free he want our minds to be free he want our conscience to be free he don't want nothing hold in our heart that's going to hinder our relationship with him God don't want that he want us to be set free and that's what Jesus did he came and set those that was bruised and wounded they was bruised through uh complexes in their lives they was religiously religiously bruised through the Pharisees Sadducees Jesus was dealing with a of bruised people that's what he was dealing with but he come to set them free and I believe that's what the message of the hour that's reason why the prophet of God himself went through pain Agony suffering disappointments God built him to be able to deliver the message that he able to deliver because he was able to put himself there cuz he been through it amen losing his wife losing his daughter all those things have to happen then God allowed him to go through that just so he can deliver messages for us so that we can be set free because every Prophet have to be a partaker of his own ministry that's why you find in the scripture God would cause a prophet to lay on his side one year then to get in the flip and lay on the other side another year I'm so glad God ain't ask none of us to do that but that is not uh a a fiction that was not a a madeup story that actually happened but it wasn't nothing that he did it was what the children of Israel was doing but he had to suffer through it through his ministry so that God could show an example for him amen so that is the exact reason why a lot of time pastors go through things sometimes it's not nothing that we done but God allow a pastor to go through something and let him go through it and then he'll build a message out of it then he preach it and it'll be something that somebody else has gone through that's the way God works sometime God allow you to go through something just so you'll be able to you're going to run into somebody someday and you'll be talking to them you'll say man I've been through that now you would be able to witness to them because you experienced it so a lot of things we go through in life is actually not for you sometimes it's God to do that through you so that you would be able to help somebody else and that's just the way that it is amen so every Minister got to be partaker of his own sermons and every congregation got to be partaker of the sermons that they hear so it works all together but it works for the good can we say praise the Lord now if you will I want to read something go to Job chapter 42 I'm sure we're all familiar with the story of Job the things that job went through it was nothing that job done job went through a trial cuz he was perfect amen the Bible said God told the enemy you consider my servant job he's a perfect man amen he was bragging on job so job was going through something he had no reason why had no idea what was going on but God permitted that battle to take place and one thing we got to realize and that give us as Believers give us hope that the devil can't do nothing to you without God's permission amen and I'm thankful for that amen and know Satan's desire was to get job to curse God but God knew Job wasn't going to curse him God had confidence in his servant and I like what the prophet of God he said can God feel the same way about you and I say he do amen he feel the same way about his bride that's why God Amen that's why we understand the lid has been been torn off of hell every demon every force that Satan has has been released in this age that's why God Satan done emptied hell and God emptied Heaven that's why the breaking of the seal the fullness of the word has come to the Bride of Jesus Christ where we could come back any Spirit any demon God has given us the material amen so those things are so amen so but now job the things that that he was going through not understanding what was going on but God was bragging on his servant have y'all ever thought about this when the Angels was deceived in heaven they was deceived in a perfect place you ever thought about that heaven was perfect but the devil was able to deceive them in a perfect place then they was kicked out of heaven now Eve when Adam and Eve was in the garden they was in a perfect place and the devil was able to come to deceive Eevee in a perfect place can we say praise the Lord but now God Eve fell in a perfect place the Angels fell in a perfect place now God put you and me in the worst place in the worst age and said you won't fail can me say amen and I'm thankful for that that's the confidence God has in his bride the prophet of God said the bride won't fall am amen sometimes we might look at conditions and things in our life and feel falling but you're looking in the wrong mirror that's why we supposed to look towards Calvary cuz everything that we have need for Christ died on Calvary for you and me and I'm so thankful for that amen so job in the scriptures here if there's a man that could have allowed bitterness to come into his heart it was job and Joseph the things that happened to them the things that people done to them they could have easily got bitterness in their heart that's right and now and and I can guarantee you they had Temptations or wanting to hate because of what they was going through but Joseph out of all the things that he went through God had to train him till he got to a place he realized God has done this for me to me for a purpose everything Joseph went through was for his brothers amen so to preserve them amen God knew that Joseph didn't know it and I like what Joseph said you done it for evil but God done it for good if there ever was a good quote to re to live by is De one you may done it for the evil but God done it for the good and they go and show you that Joseph had leared something he had now came into all power he could have very easily told them Egyptian to kill his Brethren amen just one word they could have done it but Joseph had power but he didn't use it for the wrong thing see sometimes people think power is what you can do power is also something that you can do and you got the power not to do it you got the character not to do it that is also power can we say praise the Lord now job all the things that job went through job cursed everything but God Amen can we say Amen but I want you to watch the scripture in job 42 verse 7 and let me say this before I read this God do things sometime we just don't understand it but he has the purpose you know Abraham was in Fault when he took his family down to Egypt yeah right Abraham was in fault he told Sarah what to say that was his fault by Abraham fault God was F to curse this man Kingdom going to curse this King right but look what God turn around and tell him go get Abraham and pray for you that King could have said this man told me that was his sister and you want him to pray for me he the one that was wrong but God he do whatever he wants to do when he wants to do it he don't think like us but he want us to think like him that's why he want us to have the mind of Christ can we say praise the Lord and let me just uh just I just want to lay a little Foundation here I know I'm I trust we getting somewhere but just kind of I know you listen to me see where I'm going and I'm also filling your spirit to see where you're going cuz you never you don't know me and I don't know you but we all know Jesus Christ you got to remember something brothers and sisters we see the same Sun but we don't see the same clouds so we got differences in life but we got to look at the same son praise the Lord now watch this in job 42 and it was so verse 7 and it was so that after the Lord had spoken the words unto job the Lord said unto elast the timite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job which we know there was false accusing job as a secret sinner job said death in the Bible said therefore take unto you you seven blocks and seven Rams and go to my servant job and offer for yourself a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you now look how they don't call Job secret centner and all these things now God said now he got to pray for you see God is turning the whole story around right now amen after all of the accusation he said for him will I'll accept least I deal with you after your folly and that you have not spoken of me the things which is right like my servant job now here's the test they done a lot of things to job they called job a lot of things now God is not only going to Jud touch them but he's still going to test job job last test that he went through are all of the things that happened his last test was able to forgive that was his last test to forgive out of all these things people said about you and done now are you willing to forgive cuz watch the scripture now verse n so elphas the Tonite and badad the shuhite and zofar the zamite went did according to did as the Lord commanded them the Lord also accepted job now watch what it's saying and the Lord also so accepted job now watch the other scripture and the Lord turned the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before what turn everything in that trial that joob was going through was his ability to pray for them and forgive them for what they done to him and when job prayed look what the scripture said the Lord turned the Captivity of job friend that's powerful That's The Power of forgiveness it changes things it brings peace not only between you and God it brings peace between you and yourself and the one that probably even may it offended you praise the Lord I really like that scripture he turned the Captivity of job notice when he prayed for his friends so that was not only letting job free it was also letting them free and that's the power of forgiveness amen can we say praise the Lord let's go a little further here turn with me to Isaiah chapter 1 I just just uh see what verse I want here let's go down to verse five and I'll say some things after this scripture I use this scripture right here because I find myself in pastoring you know sometimes you got to be patient you got to be very patient sometimes people can be offended about something somebody say you need to go correct that brother you need to correct them you need to take care of that it's not necess you can't move quick you have to wait you have to have patience because one thing I know is somebody is bruised up all tore up inside and they got complexes within thems themselves you you actually can't correct them you can try but it won't do no good they won't receive it so some healing they have to take place to they can come to a place where they could receive correction because the scripture makes it very plain here verse five he said why should you be stricken anymore you will Revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint other words it's saying why rebuke you why I correct you anymore it ain't going to do no good you're just going to get more mad you going to go get mad more matter I talked to a young guy one time and he uh I this it was he moved away I waited about nine months and I finally called him and I talked to him I said I want to share some things with you he was no longer in my church and then I was talking to him and so forth sharing some things with him he said why you telling me this now I said cuz then you want to listen to me and your head was sick I said you wouldn't have listening to me I said but now you don't matured a little bit now you would listen I think that those are some Godly good principles to use and I learned these things actually from Brother brandham how did he handled things because the Bible said that an angry man is hard to win if they're offended you just can't win them so the main thing is work with the offense can we say praise the Lord now let's go a little further verse six it said from the soil of the foot even into the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and petrifying sores that has not been closed neither bound up neither MiFi with ointment now the key thing to this scripture here it said wounds and bruises that has never been closed neither bound up or mollified that goes back to what I said in the beginning many people got wounds and bruises in their life that are not closed they not have been dealt with correctly that's why they keep resurfacing can we say amen that's what Jesus said he come to do set them that have been bruised set them at liid set the capus free that's what he came to do because God want us to have complete healing body mind and soul do you believe that I believe that with all of my heart amen amen so now in the scripture we just read now if anybody here is in the medical field if you get a real deep cut on your body you can try to Band-Aids ain't going to do it you can stick all the Band-Aids you want on it that's not going to be sufficient enough you have to go through a high level than that to go to stitches or either Staples now if you don't put little bandages all over that wound what's going to happen Gang Green can set in and diseases could set in then you might say I better go to the doctor now and get something fixed now if you go to the doctor he's not going to spray nothing on top of that wound and then patch it up and say go on that's not what he's going to do he going to have to reopen it he will reopen that womb which will be more painful than the wound itself is to reopen it but when he reopen it he will get it set for the right healing that it needs to to get healed right right painful but the healing will take place because it been dealt with careful and I believe that's why the message is so precise every area you can think of whether dealing with children husband wives Church there's things in the message that would bring healing to the body God cover every area amen because the main thing is for the wounds to be healed properly that's the main thing right there can we say praise the Lord now dealing with wounds and bruises and pain and so forth we all go through them things always happen some of them are more crucial than others you know children go through bruises children go through hardships and then we have to be as parents we got to have that discernment to realize what our child is going through you know sometimes uh uh I got a young girl in my church the parents just get aggravated with her I mean they just get aggravated this girl I just don't know what's wrong with her and then they might discipline her and she seems to get worse and seemed to get worse but what the problem was she was getting picked on at school and she never told her parents see when a child get picked on at school and get and get bullied on and so forth they hold a lot of stuff inside and they start getting rebellious and then the parents start disciplin them they get more rebellious so you need to go and find out why is my child acting this way and that's what they was missing she was getting picked on at school bringing it home amen so spanking them wasn't going to heal that hurt heal that wound they had to approach that thing go to the school talk to the people in school find the kids that do it work with it to bring healing to that child and then doing that the child would realize my parent cares about me they just don't want to be hitting on me they're trying to help me solve this problem then it brings fellowship with the family amen can we say amen that's just a proper way trying to heal a wound that's right praise Lord are we all right tonight praise God let's go on a little further forgiveness the power of forgiveness we can go by this many different ways even how Jesus Christ come to forgive us for our sins that brings a power of release but one thing I like about the Lord he ain't like you and me he can forgive and forget we can forgive but we still remember can we say amen amen I I was talking to a young man just the other day when you got pain or or wounds even in your body the way that you know you've been spiritually healed properly by the word of God is when you could think about something somebody done to you and you no longer feel the pain but if you can think about something somebody done and and you start feeling that that means that something's still there it ain't been fixed but God wants to fix it you know sometimes uh somebody might offend you in the church they actually how many of you know sometimes somebody can offend you in the church and didn't even mean to do it and you think they did it they actually Innocent but what people go wrong at when somebody might say something out of turn and it might not even meant that way and they felt like oh they talking about me then they hold it in their heart hello see when you hold it in your heart that allows the enemy to come in now and build on that so that's why the best thing to do that's one reason why I'm a straight up front person somebody say something I don't like I just tell them and I just say hey brother I I didn't appreciate that that well I do got a different approach I just say let me repeat to you what you just said I want to make sure did you mean what you just mean and I repeat it and they say yeah that's what I meant I said I said brother I didn't appreciate that that's just the way that I am cuz some I'm not going to hold it cuz if I hold it I know what it's going to do to me I'm a living example what it'll do when I see that brother I might be smiling in church shaking his hand but I'm going to be thinking about what he said that won't be no Fellowship so the best thing to do bring it in the open talk about it so we can have fellowship and Crush that devil because we are not one another enemy The Devil is the enemy he is the one that we want to attack not each other but the enemy can we say praise the Lord all right it's going a little father let me just give you a personal testimony I believe in healing totally I I believe in that I do I really do because I didn't have a e life myself but God knows how to mold us and we go through things just for in the future and then we see things pass years pass things happen in life then he'll take us back he's saying this is why this is why I took you through that you see brother brandham lost his family because of disobedience is that right so Disobedience caus God to do things but he didn't hold it against God he was fixing to but thank God for the seed cuz he said if if he going to be like that then I it stopped them from blaspheming cursing God because the seed was there can we say praise the Lord so that's why many things go in our lives we never say nothing bad towards God but we can do it towards each other and make no difference which way you put it it's wrong are you with me you know unforgiveness when a person have unforgiveness in their life it actually leads to bitterness and then bitterness could lead to hate then hate could lead to just being despising it get worse and it get worse and it get worse so the important thing is to stop it when it starts can you say amen amen and forgiveness unforgiveness actually it will control you amen that's what it'll do we don't want it to control us but it will control us you know in my life I just you'll know a little bit more about me I just give you a little testimony here in my life I grew up 23 years of I would say 18 years I grew up 18 years of my life with hate and unforgiveness and want to pay back so I'm speaking from experience I grew up 18 years like that because I didn't have a a good life like many have but I don't go back and cry about that now I thank God now because I see why I had to go through what I went through Hallelujah and one thing God built me up I see now the things that I went through God helped me to help young people I preach a lot of Youth meetings it's simply because God designed me from my youth to be able to relate and he T me through some things and one thing about pain and hurt brothers and sisters I know how it controls and it don't want to let go but then I know the power of God how God can just take care of all those things pull them completely out of your life and you just can become a new creation a new creature in Christ Jesus I guess I'm not saying I'm going to say something not to be sorrowful but just give you kind of a IDE idea what I've been through myself the the the biggest hurt the biggest bruise that I evered in my life is when I lost my mother my mother was killed and the thing what brings it to the painful situation my father killed my mother and I was actually sitting in my mother lap when my father killed her and I'm going tell you something as a child I relive it every day I think about my mother I think about what my father did I could see her every day laying on the floor grasping for breath I see it every day that right there at the age of six it created bitterness hatred in my heart against my father now at the age of six there was nothing that I could do but when my father got out of jail he got out of jail I was at the age of 12 because my father was able to do some manipulation to get out of jail a whole lot earlier because he was a working for the judge but what happened when my father got out of jail the only thing that I was interested in I was trying to devise a plan how I was going to kill him I mean you can't help but think that way I was just a child and I just wanted to pay this man back so what happened he got out of jail and he come up to me you know hey son and all this that didn't mean nothing to me because I was bruised I hated him it was no forgiveness there you see when somebody when there's no forgiveness there people can even try to be good to you but that hurt and pain blocks all of that out you won't see nobody good the only thing it'll drive you to do is to see what they done wrong that just the bottom line so to make a long story y'all don't mind I give you just a little testimony is that okay well let me back up just a little bit when my mother died it was eight of us I got four boys and it was four girls one of them going on now but you know uh we lived in a a little complex where my father my grandfather had land and all his children lived on the land so when my father done what he did we had no choice to go move and live with my grandmother but when we lived there all of my cousins and my aunts and uncles they all lived on the property now you would think that you don't have such a tragedy losing your mama people would feel sorry for you but that was the opposite for us we got treated like dogs and the reason why my dad killed their sister so now they are hurt but they took it out on us we didn't do it that was my mama but they took it out on us you know I had a this woman just hated me I I don't know if y'all ever experienced this I have experien where people can hate so much that when they talk to you you can feel it I've experienced that as a child so what I done this aunt she just couldn't stand me we got beat for things that we didn't do we got blamed for things that we didn't do what was happening out of all of this it was building hate it was building Payback I'll pay them back one day and I never forget you know you know uh all my cousins could get the toys that they want one thing I always have said about Santa Claus I said if he was real he was cheap cuz I got used stuff my cousin got new stuff he's not fair that's what I felt about Old Santa Claus which we know he ain't real anyway but I'm saying this for a reason when I begin to see my cousins have new stuff and I got use stuff you know what that start driving me to steal it I said I want new stuff why can't I have it then they well look with your daddy you ain't got no Mama you ain't got no Daddy I said but I want new stuff and you talking about the age of eight going around age of 10 walking away going to department stores then I start stealing that don't justify wrong is wrong but what happened I started stealing at a young age and before the Lord got hope to me at the age of 23 that steing turned into Robin uh I mean I mean just doing crazy stuff arm robbery I done that all that stuff I'm not bragging on that I'm just telling you when something is set wrong never fixed it just keep adding to go wrong until that there is a change amen so what happened all through my life around the age of 12 and I did try to kill my daddy I actually did but I didn't succeed but I'm thankful today I didn't succeed cuz I would have to live with that right now but it to bring any light to the story when I come to the message I let my daddy to the Lord because I couldn't hate him no more hallah Luke 4 was fulfilled in my life I couldn't have set them free that was bruised the captives so now I couldn't hate this man no more I said he needed God I don't know what happened between him and my mama but all I know now I've Been Changed now I've got to have comp passion for another soul and by God's grace we led him to him before he died amen but you know I was sharing this with you Pastor I was just a straight out Thug all I thought about was crying and I'm GNA be honest with you my career was going to be a professional thief and you know where I got that from television that's why people don't realize that certain things they let their children look at it affects them differently from you you have to be careful what you let them listen to careful what you let them watch especially in this day the way they brains are children can come out of their mama womb you can give them an iPhone see like they don't know how to work it that's that's technology hn I can give a child a phone for you know it you said how did you do that no instructions yeah that's the age that we're living in but you know I done all this stuff and let me just skip I want to go to some bad stuff let me just skip go a little higher but I never when I was 23 years old and I'm not saying this to justify nothing wrong but my wife actually led me to the Lord and how she did it she was my girlfriend at the time and uh I don't know if y'all know this brother his name is is Benny Perry my wife uh had death in her family and brother Benny Perry he asked the family he said can I come down and witness to the family and the family told him yes so they they went to the funeral and my girlfriend which is my wife now she went to the funeral with her uncle and then all of a sudden a couple of weeks went by and she come and told me she said I'm a Christian now I said yeah right sure yeah you yeah you're a Christian you in my mind sure you you'll do the same thing cuz I had seen so much Hypocrites but you notice my she would come up and I had a rap group cuz I was a professional dis jockey and we was getting ready to go big we was going ready to get some contracts and stuff that's what my mind was set on you know when she start going to church and here I am old Thug I never forget it it was a plate of spaghetti I fixed me a plate of spaghetti and I was fishing to eat it but I prayed for it before I was F to eat it and she she said you know God didn't hear your prayer and I got mad I said how could you say that she said because God don't hear a sinner's prayer and I said who do you think you are you so holy all of a sudden and you're going to tell me that she said God don't hear your prayer when she said that something spoke inside she's telling you the truth wow then I got mad I did I just got mad so a little time went by a little time went by and I had a sister that was very religious she always went to church so she come up my house and she said you know God is not in your sister church now I really got mad I you just not popping up being a Christian she been going to church all all these years now you're going to say he ain't in my sister church he sure ain't I said how could you say such a thing she because God is not in denomination now I got real mad but what was happening by her giving me the word something was striking saying she's telling you the truth truth will make you mad know it's truth and you know it's cutting you it can make you mad but you know it's you but because you love God you'll receive it so that happened and then all of a sudden you know I she would tell me thing about the Bible of course I get mad and my little group that I had I would tell them what she say I would go to my gu say he man you know my girl saying this and this and this cuz we had a guy in my group he was pretty religious he was a Baptist guy he said oh yeah yeah no no that ain't right I said well that's what she said that preacher said man I'm just saying it see what happened I was thought believing her but now I'm telling them see what they think about it that's what was going on so a little more time went by and then my wife she she start changing I'm speaking in high terms she start acting different then I said man this girl changing and that's what caught my attention I said man my girl ain't right man I go tell my group I said look I said my girl ain't right I said you know what I said it's that preacher I said why do this man got to drive two hours to come down here and start a church I said for him to be I said what it is where he's from he's a crook and they know it so he got to come down here when nobody don't know it you see you going to only think out of your own capacity cuz that's what I was so that's the way you going to think hello so I said hey that's okay so uh you know I was I was in a little gang so I asked one of my guys I said hey man said yeah his name flip I Saidi want you to take me to church tomorrow he said what I said I want you to just take me to church drop me off and come and pick me up at a certain time he said all right okay so man he come and took me to church and I think let me out over here you know how you want to be a little secret you want to be secret you don't want nobody to really see you let me out over here and I just walk down there so he let me out I'm walking to the church you know you britches and St all Thug when I was walking in the church a brother met me at the door his name is brother Harrison he said God bless you brother he reached his hand out to shake my hand uh when you a thug you don't laugh and smile and Shake one another hand like that that's that don't work back in my day that we call it gay just to be honest with you he reached out and shake my hand I'm like man this ain't right Shake somebody hand wrong with you I walked into the church I'll tell you something when I walked into that church I saw my wife family clapping their hand her brothers was in there I used to run around with her brothers I just knew it'd be a matter of time they'll be back but you know what when I went into the church I realized they were happy amen I said man they clapping and singing singing a song How Great Is Our God how great is the word you know I was listening to it but I had my own tune to it but I was listening I said man the people happy and then all of a sudden here come the preacher the man that don't stole my girl I look at the preacher come out look at your bald head I'm criticizing cuz I'm mad I'm mad look at it just look at it then I just start this critiquing to me you know yeah yeah don't even look at a cook and then all the sudden when he start preaching when that man start preaching I said this sounds right let me explain something to you friend when I went to church that one time I've been in church ever since just from that seeing something real and my wife caught my attention that's what caught my attention now I can go on now it's a whole long testimony if any of you you like to hear my testimony you can go on Jeff the website in Li Ohio I gave it there but that right there changed everything right there in my life because I let Christ come into my life and that's what changed and that what brought the Forgiveness that's what did it you see I learned one thing friends when true forgiveness is not there old past hurts and pains will always have a right to resurface and I'm saying they have a right because they do that's the Bible even Jesus said himself you don't forgive neither will my heavenly Father in Heaven forgive you so we've been challenged in the message of the hour to forgive It's Hard In the Flesh to forgive somebody for something and they are in the wrong but God requires us to St forgiven that's not easily done in the flesh but by the spirit of Christ it is you can let it go because when you forgive somebody for something you're not only releasing them you're releasing yourself just kind of the way that it goes can we say praise the Lord so how many of you ever read domestic disease and afflictions ain't no way I can get through with this brother be but I'll just give some more testimonies it's still on the subject in the message disease and affliction the prophet of God talks about a Cancer and a Tuma and he begins to explain how that these things happen he said a a cancer or tumor he said word start it starts from a bruised he said starts from a bruised cell he said what happened that cell get bruised he said then that cell backslides he said then it stops the flow of the blood that should run freely through it once it stops the flow of the blood he said that cancer will begin to stack up like pancakes go layer upon layer upon layer upon layer he said that what will begin to happen and it all starts from a bruise are you with me yes so when I begin to study that I studied this years ago and then he brought it to the spiritual and that's the exact same thing he said that's the same thing a happen in the church something can happen in the church us backsliding in a member and then when a member backslid sit in church it can start spreading the csel in the church he said the main thing when something is bruised is heal the backslid for it starts stacking up and packing up can we say praise the Lord let me just give you for nobody I don't want nobody to think I'm person attacking them but I know exactly what's going on I just use myself as a example even a true example I would use myself because I know how these things work now marriage life I think one of the greatest things that hurt in marriage is when we lose our first love of the marriage hello praise the Lord how many of you can remember the first time you met your wife first time you met your husband how you acted I'mma tell you how I acted when I first met my wife you know you'll be willing to do anything to please him hello Brother come on now you just willing I mean you aimed at it man you said whatever it takes I got a winner I'm going to do whatever it takes you know how it is you be on your job you know you know I don't know how it is up here you know Friday is usually payday you know you get paid on Friday and you be on your job thinking about your girl you know cuz you know Saturday or Friday the daddy permit me to see her and you just working and you're smiling and you're happy and your coworker like what's wrong with you man get to see my girl this weekend man you got to act like that yeah you don't know what she does to me man she means something to me they think you're crazy cuz they don't know what she means to you that's why we got so much of the joy of the Lord in our life when everything is going wrong we still happy and people be like how could you be happy in such a time as this I said you just don't know what he do to me he do so much to me I got to be happy righten so you know how it is and you get you get out there and get home and you put on your best clothes you can think of I mean you don't want to go and your work cold looking like a bomb and all dirty no you want to be presentable to the family and that's what you want to do so all a you put on your nice clothes you wash your own car up you know when you're washing your car you just thinking about her that's shining it man she all on your mind you know how it is you get the car shiny then you just step back and just look at it oh yeah yeah that's it right there and all a sudden you you get in your car you on the way to a house you just doing like the somebody might pass by you and say you be at the red light and then they look at you you just brother am I

about it yeah I told y' take it that's what we'll do now you get in the car where you say you want to go she say I want to go such a something okay riding down the road I really changed my mind can I go somewhere there you need to make up your mind where do you want to go the first place second place third make up your mind where do you want to go what happened see when you fall from the first love right them the results you get right there can we say praise the Lord can I go just a little bit longer I'm trying to finish this because I can show you what happened the children up through the adult line through the church I preached on this before it's a series bruises of the pastor bruises of the church bruises of the children bruises of the wife bruises is of the husband all of them got their own category even though they all got their own category it's one solution for every one of them is the word but it depends on what happened how you handle it by the word that solved the problem can we say praise the Lord amen you know as a man and I understand this when the prophet of God talks about even a housewife he made a statement that when a man would come home to his Queen he said and everything is in order he said everything that kind of stress and the things that happened on the job he said it leaves him he said he just forgets about it and that is the truth I don't know if you got housewives in here or not but I can tell you something sister you can set such an atmosphere in your home even when your husband come home with a little Spirit on him it could cast it off of him but if he come home he got a spirit when I mean by Spirit sometimes it's not I'm not talking about nothing if dealing with morals or nothing like that I'm talking about even stress of the day because things could have happened on the job could got in with it with a coworker or the boss man deliberately does something and then it's offended him now he could come home and that's a lot of time with me mess up bringing that home when they should deal with it where is at and then don't bring that spirit in the house how many of you read the quote the prophet God said if one member of the family get nervous he said the whole family should get nervous because it's a spirit amen children can be in their room playing with the TOs having a good time and then the parents can start arguing in the other room for you know you hear the children fighting with each other the spirit actually travel through the house that's exactly what happens I'm just telling you I can give you the quote on that so those are the things that we have to look forward to how many of you know Church don't start here church starts at home we are the real people at home we come to church and act churchy but we're the real one when we're at home that's who you are when we walk in the doors brothers and sisters whatever spirit is in your house that's what you bring in the church that's a fact can we say Amen but I'm preaching Deliverance because I know we've been called to live higher than these things but I'm just trying to show how the enemy can slip in little foxes that small Divine that do the simplest little thing and it causes problems but we got to stand up with our Christian right and say not so this is my house dedicated to the Lord Jesus Christ Satan you're not welcome here amen and deal with those things can we say praise the Lord you know I just give you another example sometimes I might offend my wife and don't even know it I don't understand it sometimes I apologize honey I really didn't for forgive me about the other day I really didn't mean to do that I didn't mean to offend you she said you didn't offend me like I did and I didn't and then sometimes she tell me uh you you done this and this what I didn't do it I didn't mean to do it so when I think I offended her I didn't but when I offend her and then she said don't bother me cuz let me just give you a good example one time I got a little Spirit on I'm just being real with you I'm being real I got a little Spirit on me I can't remember what happened uh my wife said something and it really bothered me this been years ago we a whole lot more more mature than that now and uh she said something and I didn't like it and she was trying to talk to me and I was trying to be sarcastic she would say something I'd be sarcastic or say something funny but she wasn't getting mad I was actually trying to make her mad but the more that I tried the happier she got hello I said I said something offend her and she just kept smiling said she ain't getting mad and more I say the happier she got and I start getting mad I said she just hey what's going on and I said she loving me and it's killing me I'm trying to make her mad but she's loving me you know what happened happened it cast the spirit off of me and I told her I said You cast the spirit off of me I I was trying to be hateful but you kept loving me and it did cuz love is a powerful weapon she catched it right off of me and I felt like but she did it so I know these things work can I give some more examples I'm trying to quit to be on which I really am I'm really trying to quit you know you can come you know sometime a sister can be at home in Revival everything going good just happen just everything just happy hunky D husband can walk in the door she's happy she can say hey honey yeah that old dry talk how's your dad at work h uh dinner is ready mhm I'll be there in a minute all of that is actually slashes she can be like H what's wrong with him anyway I'll leave it alone at then end of the day or so then you could you know sit and you eat your dinner he's all grouchy and everybody at the table CU you know when you sitting at the dinner table and somebody got a spirit on Everybody Somebody what go a it's attention what that is Spirits done gathered around and it's oppressing that's what's going on he's sitting there then that day go by and then she might have a bad day while he's at work she have a bad day she just might be washing dishes or something then the enemy come you know your husband don't appreciate you you sure don't these children don't appreciate you look how they treat you look how they talk to you look how they act around you they sure don't see listening to that it start building up building up building up and you like now the husband come home this day and Revival right ain't mad he walks in the house and you washing dishes he come up there and Pat you on the back hey honey how you doing you go and he'll be like you all right I am fine see now you telling a lie you're not fine huh woo see what don't happen the bruises from the previous weeks cuz it was never fixed it's still there and all understand what's wrong with you ain't nothing wrong with me you sure I'm sure I'm ask y'all a question is anybody good in history in history when you in school was you good in History anybody good in history let me explain something to you friends I guarantee you we got a church full of historians what do historious what do history do takes you to the past and when you hold stuff in your heart that's what you become a historian honey you okay ain't nothing wrong with me you sure then all of a sudden here come the history class oh you don't remember you don't remember what you done what did I do it was 6 months ago go we was at your daddy house you had on a blue shirt and you had on your church shoes that day you don't remember what you said and it was 5:00 see that's the way a woman thinks she can detail everything right to the letter and then repeat what you you said I don't remember say oh yes you do I can tell you exactly what you said and it works from a bruise just because you wouldn't talk about it the right way and settle it it'll build up just like those pancakes I'm just being honest with your friends that's where forgiveness will have to come into play CU if forgiveness don't take place and you don't handled it according to the word guess what happen it gets worse worse and worse and it'll keep resurfacing because she never fix it and the devil's sitting back laughing yeah that's right tell him that too you yeah the devil will help you with your memory that's but you can kill that just by saying this is wrong we need peace in this house we need unity in this house let me just kill this right now that's the way that it works somebody got to be willing to stand up and say hey let's talk things ain't been going right we need to kill the spirit and then by that confession and that forgiveness you will literally feel those spirits leave and then when that's done bound it up in prayer let me explain something brothers and sisters how many of you ever read the quote the prophet of God said we going to always make mistakes anybody read that let me explain something to you friends that's okay that's a good quote but if you ain't reading it right it'll back by sure we going to make mistakes but you need to make new ones the same old mistake over and over and over is not a mistake hello amen that need to be some Deliverance somewhere let me give you an example what's your name brother brother John if I was to be walking right here and I was to slip and go bow hit brother John and he seemed I tripped forgive me he said brother Bley don't you worry about it no problem that was a mistake I said thank you brother John then I go bow what you think he'll do then whoa brother something wrong that wasn't a mistake something wrong with you brother see first one was second one wasn't so sometime we can justify mistakes we keep trying to we can we can try to justify some something that need to be some Deliverance we'll keep calling it mistake when it's not a mistake it's something that needs some spiritual attention to kill it and to cush it I'm not trying to beat you down church I'm just pouring my heart out to you because I don't believe in whacking people down but I believe in Deliverance amen because when you expose something is one thing but once it's exposed deal with it and kill it that's the other thing can we say praise the lord lord I seen these things I seen parents bruise the children I seen it you know the worst thing a parent could ever do is to compare their child with somebody else's child amen that's the worst you can ever do that's right you know you get your child why you acting like that look at him he don't act like church like you act you need to stop that behave yourself have some manners like him but look at you your child doing like there you know what's going to happen he going to keep it right there yeah one day the children might be out playing church and you hear something go ah you know what happened the child you compared to he hit him yeah he going to see that little child looking at him then hearing your words comparing it then I say he just go they let off his pressure yeah because what you built up in it yeah hello it's wrong amen I see it over and over and over again and I even tell I teach this to my church don't do that because it builds up things in the child life can you say amen I don't seen Brothers make mistake you you know what I am very smart whenever we have a church dinner picnic or whatever I make sure I eat my wife food I'm just business oh she's a perfect cook but I'm going to make sure if I eat any dish it going to be heard cuz I know better I'm just being honest with you I've seen people at church functions because everybody eating everybody else food is getting eaten and then they see their is not getting eaten and they let a spirit get on them yeah then the devil come they don't even like your food then be like sure don't y'all want to try something this oh with f you see there now they lying to you they just don't want your food and they get spirits on them they take their little pot of beans and their little spirit and go on with it and mope over it I seen it what I'm preaching to you brothers and sisters we supposed to be way above that because this is adoption time we are in adoption season where we should know how to handle those things my wife said did you like my food yes ma'am it's delicious and I'm not lying because I'mma tell you right now that's why brother I teach my own church the young girl they say they want to get married I said you make sure you learn how to cook and take care of a house before you get married don't let your husband be your guinea pig let your daddy and your brother be your guinea pigs so when you marri a man he could be blessed cuz I'm going tell you right now when me and my wife first got married I think she thought I was an alar she gave me a lot of burnt offerings she couldn't cook and the reason why cuz the way she was raised I was raised we was raised wrong but now we coming into the word learning how to live all over again now she's the best cook in the world but I was her guinea pig and guess what I wasn't a man I was a young man no wisdom she had to suffer because of my thinking and my boyish ways cuz I wasn't into my manhood she suffered from that that's why when I preach at youth meeting now let him say grow up while you're at home live a life of singl with the Lord Jesus Christ Christ overcome your youthful lust while you're single so you won't drag that baggage into your marriage that's what I promotes to the young people because marriage itself is pressure it's going to it attracts it because when you get married you know what really happening it's two different households class that's what it is here's the thing you come out of your honeymoon and one thing when you come off your honeymoon you make sure you leave honey on the moon hello make sure you keep everything sweet you come into you finally come together you know what happened I didn't do like that at my house well I didn't do like that at my house things start clashing but to solve those problems and say okay that's the way you did at your house that's where I did it in my house let's come together how we going to do it in our house let's stop the clashes from the different houses I tell the young boy I said I said I'm going tell you son I said one thing you don't never want to do I said you offend your wife I should never tell her you don't cook like my mama I said don't do that I said mother than lik she might tell you while go home let your mama kick you something then I said brother don't do that it cuts her it does so a lot of little things that happen in early states of marriages that even son won't fix they find it later on in they marri it starts surfacing up again just because it wasn't fixed but the power of forgiveness it goes a long way can we say praise the Lord I'm trying to finish musicians can start coming then I know I'll finish but it's the truth brothers and sisters the power of forgiveness I've seen the good I seen the bad but the good always the bad amen how you handle things by the word of God and it brings a change the enemy you know sometimes people can get offended in church and I watched it through the years sometime when a person just really offended and they letting the devil get the best of them they'll usually be start when the service is over they'll usually start being the first one walking out to church because they're offended and sometime the devil can get people to a place face they'll Stand Out by the church and then the devil be like you know so and so ain't going to shake your hand oh I know they ain't they going to walk right by me they ain't even going to shake my hand just because you expecting that looking for that they won't shake your hand just because you look for that that's the way the enemy operates but I believe in Breaking Chains amen that's why I like being honest with my brothers I being like being honest with my sisters and being honest with myself I break the chain and sometimes I be wrong if I feel like somebody even offended me sometime I'll get them aside say bro look I could be wrong but I'm feeling this from you and shut sh sh and then they said brother Burley that ain't nowhere in my mind I don't feel nothing like that right that and I said you forgive me for let the enemy put that in my mind kill it and crush it and I said pray for me I did not go on about my way that don't make me no smaller that don't make me no bigger but it show up bringing me closer to the Lord and then I me and my brother and my sister have clear Fellowship no thinking wrong that's why you know I don't say nothing bad about people children if I say something about somebody's child I'll say it to them with the concern that's what I do and people still get mad when you do that because people get offended with the children we as Believers should be so higher and a higher level we can talk to one another about things cuz when I say something about somebody's child it's something that I don't been through with mine and see the same pattern and I'm trying to say look if you don't stop this brother this is what's going to happen please learn from it and some listen some don't but the main thing I express what's in my heart because I want to help them not to hurt him can we give the Lord a hand praise the Lord I won't go no more let's just power here Lord Jesus there many things could have been ministered on tonight I even thought that in my own heart would probably be a little Evangelistic but I see that's not so that's the songs was being sung Lord I can see what your spirit was leading and I can see that it where it was guiding but now Lord I just ask and pray oh God that the word just be received in the hearts and like the brother was praying that it be received in the heart but mixed with faith the word didn't profit them because they didn't have it mixed with faith but may we mix it with faith and say Lord I know you come to speak to me I know you come to help me Lord I wasn't putting my finger at nobody but I sure was poting at the Devil cuz he's the one that we want to expose Lord we're your bride and I believe that we are in the season of adoption where we'll know our place we know our position we know how to handle circumstances and anything that you plac before us we be will know what you want done with the word Lord that's what I honestly believe so father even though we laughed a little bit but yet I was serious and I pray that these things is not taken as a conical way but just as a parable way to show something spiritual would you grant it heavenly father and Lord I commit all things into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church says amen God bless you brother being come keep us in your prayer as we travel home Monday I certainly appreciate it God bless [Music] you hallelujah amen are you glad it's freedom and forgiveness amen let's just stand together
