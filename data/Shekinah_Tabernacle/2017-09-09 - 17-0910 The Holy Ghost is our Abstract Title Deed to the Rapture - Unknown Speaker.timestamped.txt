[3:24] our people we've always got more
[3:26] visitors well ok yeah it's good to have
[3:33] you here and we glad that we can be in
[3:37] the house of God and just be in an
[3:39] atmosphere where we can meet the Lord
[3:42] and where our lives can be enriched and
[3:46] changed and you know when you get on not
[3:50] that I'm on very far but you kind of
[3:52] realize as you get on more and more that
[3:54] we're not really overly intelligent
[3:57] people we're not in asan you know we're
[4:01] not really as smart as what we maybe
[4:03] thought we were when we were younger we
[4:04] were who was quite intelligent when they
[4:06] were young we you know pin you heaps man
[4:10] but do it how brother Greek but it you
[4:13] know you told his dad than much when he
[4:14] was younger and then a few years later
[4:16] you realize man my dad's really you know
[4:19] moved on a lot in the last few years but
[4:22] it was actually home that it understood
[4:24] things but you know we we just call the
[4:26] Lord humbly and realizing that we don't
[4:27] know a lot and we just want the Lord to
[4:29] show us and lead us because he's the
[4:30] he's the great Shepherd you know we we
[4:33] are the more we will realize we're just

[4:38] receive his real life in receiver's
[4:40] direction and his counsel we all need
[4:44] counsel we only wisdom from the Lord we
[4:46] I do anyway
[4:47] and yeah and it's a it's a treacherous
[4:50] walk that we walk through life and at
