the beauty of Holiness as they went out before the Army and to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever and when they began to sing and to praise the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon Moab and mount Sia which were come against Judah and they were smitten um yeah so to me that's just you know we can put everything else aside and just praise the Lord and it's often

we standing we going to read a a scripture [Music] and I want you to turn to the Book of Genesis chapter 22 while we standing then we can do all the the greting modalities afterwards brother Marion thank you my brother and the crew God bless you crew man you just make the job a little easier it's never easy it's never easy absolutely speaking but the atmosphere you create I can assure you without any shadow of a doubt without any fear of contradiction they say in English I can assure you that it creates a wonderful wonderful atmosphere more especially if people enter in you know and we forget about what happened this afternoon amen let's read Genesis chapter 22 then we can sit down we'll read two scriptures Genesis and then we'll go to gal but let's start with that one Genesis 22 maybe maybe if you like let's just start from verse 16 is that okay yeah and this is now God talking to Abraham this is after the the issue of God fulfilling his promise when he has finally fulfilled it suddenly now this is if I was Abraham I'll say suddenly he tells me to take my son that I waited for 25 years he tells him take him to the Mount Moriah and and sacrifice him for me this is after that is done and Abraham did it he went right this is now God God now responds to what Abraham has done you know the story let's read it and said this is God by myself have I sworn you know when we say you you swear no sister Noel you SW by you swear by someone in Authority above you because swearing putting an oath is something of a legitimate strongest possible terms that it cannot not be done if somebody say I swear then they go back on their word you just know that they are not God Only God can keep his word they probably I don't want to say they're not God's children but we are not supposed to go back in fact we can swear only God only in marriage hey nowadays they even change it to make it acceptable let's read it I saw by myself have I swor this is God speaking sayith the Lord for because thou has done this thing now this is the verse I want us to read that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the scent which is upon the seash shore now listen to this this is our message for tonight and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy great author of Life the creator of the heavens and the Earth master of all creator of everything that we can see and those that we can see Heavenly Father Jehovah Gyra most Eternal God most gracious God we stand before thee tonight Lord not because we are capable not because we've got the ability but because you made it possible for us to be here here to come and worship you master because you died at the cross of Calvary for us we have come Lord to honor the resurrection we have come to honor the act that we have done at Calvary and I pray dear father as we have read your word heavenly father that you forgive our sins Lord forgive our trespasses our iniquities and everything that Lord we might have been cornered in a corner by the devil I pray that you forgive us let the blood take effect this this evening let the blood wash us father as we stand in your holy presence Master we commit these people we commit myself Lord we commit everyone listening even over the YouTube Lord that you your spirit will take preeminence Lord Jesus Christ let tonight Lord be the night of possessing the Gate of the enemy we commit the service into your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen please enjoy the comfort of your seats I would like everyone to feel very special tonight I would like everyone to feel welcome to welcome yourself I can welcome you I can give you the comfortable seat I can give you H but welcome yourself in the presence of the Lord you are more than welcome feel relaxed and enjoy the word of the Lord amen but the most important thing is that you you should go home with something that's right amen right so tonight I want us to speak about this subject POS possessing the gates of your enemy The Prophet preached this message a couple of times but uh because I was not going to preach this Sone but what happened to me is that let me just set up my alarm I always forget what happened to me is that uh there are some brothers who came here in the front and they preached my sermon so so I told them that Brothers you blessed me so much and you took my seron and the notes and you even added and did better than how I was going to do so I've got no more semon to preach because in the last few few Services men amen if anybody listened carefully those message were jointly connected and talking about the Jews and the Israel coming out of Egypt and what happened to them I'm so inspired by their Journey the Jews from egyp egpt to Canaan because it talks about your journey you are a you are a spiritual Israel it talks about you to them it was talking more as a nation it was talking more you know I can say Canal spiritual but more on the negative side you are the true reality of what happened that time I can't repeat those sermons just go listen to them again they on YouTube but they blessed me so much so then the Lord said talk about because now we have seen them they've entered but now in the process of entering there's things that are happening we don't we can't talk about them tonight the Israelites but I want you to focus on yourself possessing the gates of your enemy let's read Galatians amen who wants to read Galatians with me remember when I don't hear you saying amen you know I don't I don't want to be like those preachers who say somebody say Amen there you should just be automatic hey let's read Galatians 3 we'll read a few a few a few areas Galatians 3 let's start with verse 25 H what did I say yeah so verse three I mean chapter 3: 25 but after faith after that faith is come we are no longer under the school Master which is the law for you are all the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ are you listening carefully you must believe that for real real real like when I say to you tomorrow you're going to wake up and eat breakfast that's for real more real than that that's who you are don't ever let the devil make you doubt yourself verse 20 six for ye are all the children of God by Faith by faith in Christ Jesus for as many as you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ you are baptized into Christ you believe by faith God Gave You Faith you you believed it was revealed to you you're baptized in Christ now you are a fully fleshed son or daughter of God there there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither born nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if he if ye or you be Christ if in other words if you now are belonging to him Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and as according to the promise you know in that scripture God the first one that we read God made promise to Abraham he made a promise to Abraham and he said Abraham because you have done this thing in other words Abraham challenged God to the point where God said you know what I'm going to promise you and your seat that is still coming because God knows everything isn't it if God even knew God is so amazing last time I told you that God is a strange God it's not like God did not know that Abraham is going to believe him God knew but the question could be then why did God do it we we maybe we'll talk about that God knows everything but he still did it you'll see why so he promised Abraham and his seed that is why the Bible says there that if you are in CHR because Christ is the true f is the true seat of Abraham so because he's the true son of Abraham SE of seat of Abraham and you are Christ you are Christians you belong to him therefore that makes you the seat of Abraham that means you are partakers to the promises that God gave Abraham are we together I would like us to be together because I won't be long then I'll finish but I want you just to grasp it to grasp it the with the intensity that the Bible says it so okay in blessing I'll Will Bless The so this sounds like it's a it's a it's a promise even before I born and God already knows my mistakes God knows that I'm going to be born a sinner but he's already promising me why because he predestinated you he chose you some foolish person can ask and say say but why then if God predestinated us and he knew why all this H or not foolish person maybe someone small in faith or something who hasn't got the Revelation yet but you see God likes to fulfill and prove his word and nothing comes to God that belongs to him comes untested nothing comes to God even God himself he tries his own we and he he that is why he when he saw he knew this will happen there's no way God can say something and it doesn't happen so everything that is of god and everyone must come accordingly according to his word that's why when Abraham did that then God spoke and spoke for you and he says I'm going to bless them in blessing and God still knew that you're going to lie but God you he doesn't see any life from you because you he gave you a conf a confessing heart he gave you a repenting heart he gave you a a heart that accepts him he gave you a heart that accept the word and go do it when he preached and God God never doubted you God never doubted you so don't doubt yourself and don't doubt your brother because God never doubted them all I'm trying to say you tonight here is maybe somebody can say but then why would God allow all these things to happen if God knew because God wanted he had certain things in him that he wanted to bring out God wanted to be a Healer God wanted to be glorified to be worshiped he wanted to be God he wanted to be a savior and he wanted those things for them to happen all these things had to happen he he needed to find someone who's lost he needed a sinner tonight to come to Christ he needed a heart to repent he needed someone to tonight who seek to be healed otherwise how will God do it and God saw that as the best fit to do it and he saw it all in his mind and he said ah I'll do this all what we are doing now is like we are playing a a script that is all God has already seen everything we are just playing out everything and the way you play the way you play is exactly how God saw it so be careful how you play be on the right side amen amen now let's let's let's hear this okay possessing this now the question now can be you who is your enemy you've got to be able to identify to know your enemy I've never seen a battle where we fight sister armor and then you don't know your opponent your opponent is not Lilia sorry my girls Lilia your opponent is not armor even though sometimes you can not see things the same way you can differ and the more you differ the more you love one another that's how we possess we possess the more I can I I can you can be in trouble the more you can be in hardships the more you can be in anything is the more I must get closer to you the more you hurt me I know we don't just go all out to head is the more I love you that's how we possess so I want you to know that the enemy is not my brother the enemy is not even that person out there who's trying to destroy you who's trying to take maybe business from you or who's trying to kick you out of the job or who's trying to steal Factory Pizza customers that's not the enemy no no that one we love him we actually give him a free pizza isn't it yeah the more he try to bring us down we give him free free pizza and win him to the Lord so know your enemy and then it says they are going to possess the gates of their enemy you need to be able to know what are your Gates because if you don't know your Gates or the gates that you you have to possess how then will you possess them right I might not be be able to tell you tonight it may not be for tonight how and what are your Gates because I don't know your Gates but you've got to be able to know that this gate I must possess this one this one I must possess it because Joshua even Samson he picked them up not me that Samson he picked them up those gats remember he picked them up and he threw them away now there are gates in our lives right and those things that are the enemy uses that the enemy uses to deter or prevent you from overcoming and getting your promises those are your Gates the enemy uses them big time and me and you can allow the enemy to build strong gates to block us so possessing also comes from when possessing can I've never heard about possessing or winning a battle without any fight you've got to understand brothers and sisters that we fight and it's a fight it's not a joke it's a fight where we fight and we are fighting and fight fight fight if a politician can be shot almost to death and then they try to help him to take him off the stage he stand up and say no leave me fight fight fight a politician like Trump if he can do that how much more about me and you the spirit that is in you that we are singing about it it it's like a you know a revolver it's like oh last time I made a mistake I must make a correction I spoke about a matter how many remembers I said what is a matter remember and we got home and my family corrected me you know husbands you must be allowed allow yourself to be corrected by your families my family corrected me and said ah up you missed point the D I said what now huh they said no no no no calm down you you missed a point the matter that you spoke about the one of science matter is anything that can occupy space and have weight it's not the one that the scripture was referring to the there's matter and there's matter so because me I'm not English that's the excuse I always give It's a Wonderful excuse cuz I'm not English if you say matter it's matter and if I say sorry you might not know what sorry am I referring to I could be meaning that I'm not sorry so because I'm not English but the point is last time I made that mistake and I said matter so the matter was about the whole issue the whole matter in its entirety right the whole matter of you existing not that matter like this object that can occupy space no it's a whole matter of of your life that is what I wanted to say right forgive me for that so back to our possession possessing you have to fight and fighting in my language is got actually the real fight has got no rules this fight that they say no no you must have fight according to the rules of what they lie because they themselves don't fight according to the rules of Fight is a fight yeah if I bite your ear and cut it and you say oh my ear I hold it not you we are fighting the devil right yeah if in a fight we fight and a fight can get ugly yeah when two elephants fight even sister analis you know who suffers the grass say where can I run to because this is hot hot hot hot hot hot don't expect the battle to be nice and everything no you are a daughter of Abraham Abraham fought and he made mistakes as well the great father Abraham the father of Faith he also made mistakes so the only thing that you've got to know be on the right side yeah know your enemy know that you are in a fight and it can be ugly amen but there's some assurances I will tell you now Mel there's some assurances our fight is not like a worldly fight where you fight without hope yeah come on HH you try to fight you don't know who you are fighting like I was driving and then someone just come and just pass our car and just go in front and that person is under pressure he thinks I'm the enemy because I don't want to give him space for him to move you see he doesn't realize I'm not the enemy I'm just obeying the rules of the road you see so you you you need to know your enemy because sometimes the enemy can come by means of habits the enemy comes in many forms and shape one day we will talk about the intellect of the enemy for you just go and read that message of demonology and read about demons in the Physical Realm and read about demons in the physical real in the spiritual realm and understand your enemy and not dwell on much on him just read that one because he's exposed in there and you'll know know that he is fighting this battle but if you know and you he has been exposed in your life then he's not going to confuse you or or or or or somehow trigger you no no you know him you know his thoughts and you know when he comes that this is the devil and you deal with him very clearly Jon very clearly don't allow the devil to to to to bring you to low as if you don't know who you are you are an amateure God you know what is an amature God the only thing now that prohibits you you know it's just this flesh otherwise you could just create another Earth that looks like the guga national park J and only you and your dad just go there on your birthday so it's only this flesh and but we've got that power yeah amen sicknesses Temptations death habits many things can come but remember the is an assurance that not even death Christians don't die we we don't we it's just a doll God opens a a a window there then they they look at us and they they're smiling they say when they come here they're going to meet us by the gate when those great P of gates you know those great Gates of P opens that day the devil will know where he started so don't be of good courage know that you and me are daughters and sons of God and we are going somewhere the reason we are fighting is because God has got a mission to fulfill yes amen right so I said the love Faith and acting on the word of God and fervent and sincere prayer when you do things for God do them sincerely and fervently be consistent the only thing that you do you is up up the devil says you're going down you say I'm going up up up up up up you know that song up up up I'm going up you know that one maybe my wife know yeah brother know it so let's just read a few quotes and we close but I want you to know and get this assurance now before I even forget an assurance is this your battle has already been won how is that wonderful so you are fighting a battle that has already beenen how wonderful is that you have never had in the history and the future of this Earth that we're fighting a battle but it's already be otherwise they won't do it but we do it because God has got a mission to fulfill against the devil that you thought you can defeat me look I've won the he already won it that is why the scripture says but he has given you a promise already the promises for you for healing the promise for deliverance the promise for anything that you asking God he's already been given God is not a liar healing you already been sealed you are already been healed amen the only thing that you need to do the rest is done we can just take up BS and go everything is done for you this is the only thing that you need to do you just believe the word of God Amen and hold on that's all believe because it's done listen no amount of your unbelief believe is going to change God's plan whether you believe God and I'm sorry to speak this harshly but I'm trying to say this whole world if they can't believe God they won't stop the plan of God it's done done it is done sealed and dusted you are in prove to the Lord by believing his word believe it every second and hold on there hanging there hold on and he has already given you already the power to hold on yeah so he will hold you with that power you heard on Sunday that we don't we can't hold ourselves it's him who holds us so just believe don't be to the left to the right and then ticker and someday no no there will be Sunshine there will be clouds there will be that but believe even if it's unbelievable and hold on right that's what me and you has to do let's listen here for the Bible said that when we are dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and as with him according to the promise the Bible was not written now in 1976 when I was born no the Bible is has been written for a long time God had this in his mind even before it was on paperwork God had it it was already there the word of God oh my now it says that when we are dead to ourselves when we die then we are as we are we are the ones that inherit we are Abraham's seed when you die to yourself according to the promise we are Abraham's ass with him according to the promise and we receive Abraham's seed when we receive the Holy Spirit now this can be tricky but let nothing confuse you if the devil tries to confuse you just say hey man you are wasting your time because that scripture that he's reading the one that you are saying confuses is is fulfilled in me whether I see it or not when you receive the Holy Spirit then you are actually fulfilling or showing this that you are the seat you receive your seat of you a seat of a Abraham when you receive the holy spirit because it's a process and you will see now what I mean by a process so we receive a Faith with his holy spirit that was the faith that was delivered for Father Abraham for when we die in Christ we take on the promise we believe I'll show you now we believe and we get the Holy Spirit and we get trials and temptations and then all the process come and then God comes to a point where now he now recognizes your faith you are now adopt an adopted son and daughter of God but all along all the time before you get there is a process of you getting to that point but I'm saying to you already you are but you just working to a a process of repeat you are repeating what God has already fulfilled but you're getting there that's what you need to know that it is a done job but I'm in the process of fulfilling what has already happened in God's mind that is why we are saying it's a one battle it's already won it's already the devil is already been defeated but you need just to be on the right side believe believe believe amen and promise that in the days of how he would confirm the same thing that he spoke to Abraham he will confirm it again with Abraham's seat which is you are you the seat of Abraham if you the seat of Abraham everything that Abraham Abraham has gone through the seat will go through huh imagine waiting for a child for 25 years and you are an old man maybe the gynecologist of those days and the urologist told him that H Papa it can't happen but Abraham never worried about never worried about what they tell him he never all what Abraham did he didn't complicate things he just believed he didn't bother him whether he's 150 years old or his 100 years or SAR whatever stories no no that's not for him the devil brought that to him many times but he never entertained all what Abraham did is that I'm a Son of God and I believe the word of God God says I must do that I do it I believe that Lord give me more love for you that's what all what Abraham did you see so look there I got that picture for you guys is is it a lovely picture look at Abraham and Sarah they are not worried the devil wants you to be worried so that he can steal your rest as we had on Sunday he can steal you a pieace so that he can steal he he says slick tell him that I said so he's a Sleek so anything that he can bring to your mind be careful eval and review your thoughts brother and sister don't just allow every thought to go through your mind and every activity and let the devil make your mind a basketball court no don't allow him every thought like a ball that comes bumping say wait you because because you've got the authority he gave you the authority so he gave you you've got authority to command the devil and say V know you've got he has given it to no don't doubt yourself my children know that what we are telling you now is the truth and it's real that's right we are not we are not g gaming ourselves and wanting to you to be good people and come to church and have good families that's not the real aim that we have yes we want those things we want you to be soldiers of the Cross so that when we cross over we know those boys are coming amen and they're coming with a wi because the wi is given that's what we want to live this life to prep for you to be inspired and get the same holy Spirit that's what we want we're not trying to indoctrinate you we just want to live a life for you to know that we are going home very soon if you want to come believe the word of God yeah believe it do it believe it do it don't worry about whether it's hard or not that's not that's not your business that's the business for God hard easy what what the world say or anything just believe it wait believe it hold on repeat the scriptures to the devil that's right repeat it and cast him tell him like literally when I speak alone sometimes I I think maybe they think I lose it I said just get the behind me Satan get get away devil and you think he am I normal yes you are you casting the devil away cuz he bring and if you do that you're you're going to to find out that that thought is gone and you don't know what happened to it or whatever the devil was trying to to make it Trend in your mind the devil makes things Trend Trend in your mind don't allow the devil to Trend in your mind Abraham and Sarah they're discussing my watch changed and changed the the it just started and started with 3 minutes started over my watch it's not me here started just cancelled everything and started from zero so you know what I mean I don't know why I never touched it but anyway Abraham disregarded his State of Mind his state of health his state of whatever he disregarded that in the little red box I wrote there he disregarded himself and everything around him he disregarded his current state of health and circumstances around his wife he disregarded the people's opinions about himself and God he he just ignored flatly he disbelieved anything around what whatever was happening he just believed God Abraham believed what God Said was the truth he didn't consider how old he was how old Sarah was that the seem so that's how we possess the gate can I tell you can I shock you if you wake up in the morning and the devil say oh you feel like the pain and you I can't go to to church you know can I can I tell you something if you just jump and get ready and go to church before you arrive to church it's gone it it never happened to you me it happened to me even last night I had a charger of a laptop that has not been working for months or for weeks it was never working on my phone no more I tried at work even the work gadgets never worked you know the things we take and plug on the phone to church at work they were not no more working on my phone and it was only at this charger that we pl Samsung one that we pl that work my phone we tried everything the charger for the laptop and any other charger were no more working last night I didn't have any charger and I wanted to my phone to charge because I was going through the seron and then somehow I took my laptop I took my laptop charger without thinking about it the devil said oh no no no no it doesn't work I said I just didn't think about it I just didn't process that thought I just took the Char plug it and plug on my phone that same charger and it worked so who fixed it who fixed it now are you able to see God on such things now bigger things will you see because if you can see God on those things that God can send his Angel to inspire that that charger because he's looking at the inside he's looking at your motive and you objective why do you want that CH to work so that you can be praised or me can be praised that's what God checks and you me and you must think according to God's line of thinking when we when he acts we see oh this is God we must be able to see so Abraham was like that AB baby calling his wife baby she was how many 60 years 65 we going to have a baby love said you see so yeah so stop so let's just finish off with this Abraham first believed God sweats separated he got tested and he got blessed and that's what those are just I just put them there based on what Abraham experienced what Abraham went through there's many other things that he went through right now Abraham after he was called out to the land of Chalin he was called out God spoke to him and he believed you start by believing right and you believe everything that God says regardless and then you separate separation means cutting that is why God even gave him a sign of circumcision as a sign cut your flesh cut the Habit cut your time of phone cut your time of not increase the time of of of praying and cut the other times of other things if you eating more on the physical cut it and eat more spiritually yes everything that benefits flesh cut it even your budget okay sorry brother Isaac I don't mean to get in that territory brother Isaac is the trust you so he will say brother leave that area for me to address okay so believed separated tested very hard and blessed and me and you we will be tested very hard the devil even want you not to see that you being tested he wants you not even realize in other words he wants to do like a washing machine you know washing when he's in the washing machine it gets so Ted that does not know where he's going so that's what the devil wants to do to tell you that you don't even know when he's actually testing you you're confused then you're just you're just it takes you and put you in the dryer so we must never be confused and be tumbled by the devil we must be able to identify him and for you to identify him if you can only do that when you've got the atmosphere of God because you believe the atmosphere is on you you believe Against All Odds I cannot overemphasize that point but anyway these slides I can send you for you to enjoy and see what I have enjoyed and I'll just jump through to some of the things that I want to read for you uh at the end and then we can we can close on this one it was about circumcision it was about testing it was about separation it was about us believing so that's what we will go through and they will come when they come don't cry and say why me no say bring it on it's okay because even death cannot touch you what can he do he cannot touch you he can't touch your children all that you love he can't touch them you you claim them because God said even those things those that you love I'll give them to you God even G showed brother bam a dog and a horse and a chair that he loved how much more about your family man come on be serious now how much more about the people that you love so love love them regardless because that love is going to bring them claim them why did God do give Abraham a promise and fulfill it why why did God ask Abraham to to sacrifice his son that he loveed very much obviously God knew the outcome but but then why did he do it you see God knew that me and you are coming that is why I think that's why the reason brother been Abraham was not in the in the first church age or maybe during Martin Luther that's why Abraham had to be there at the beginning because God had to set an example to show us God was doing it for me and for you yeah that's what the prophet say I can read for you if you have been faithful to eat and you you're 100 years old old now now I'm going to prove my power to you this is now God brother bam talking as if God was saying I'm going to prove my power to you because you believe me Abraham so that the seat after you will know to take a hold on God's weight who's the seed us God was doing that and he knew Abraham would do that and he allowed it to happen so that me and you when we come here we do the same he was doing it for us everything I mean I've never had a man that says Ah everything in this house okay I do it for my mother or my last born of course he do it for them but that man actually everything that he does in his house is for his wife the wife is the apple of the man's eye I even told a good friend of mine today they did law and I said happy wife happy life I told him cuz we're discussing something over the phone I said happy wife so the God knows the Lord Jesus Christ knows he knows this principle of happy life I mean happy wife that's why he makes you happy he knows it and he knew that we are going to catch on it as if it's he you know it has always been there even before we thought about it God knew that I want to make my wife happy I want to make my bride the apple of my eye you know the when we say the apple of your eye I don't want to misrepresented but you know what what they mean about the apple of an ey I don't want to interpret it and then tell Bing Apple the apple of God's eye is you you are the apple of God's eye the nucleus can we say without you God is not complete you know that so you're not just a a cheap cheap human being I don't mean for us to be proud but I mean that when you possess real possess go all out and say Lord cry even have you ever found someone beating you defeating you but cry because now you are fighting a real battle you are possessing cry to the Lord cry if you want to cry don't prohibit it cry and call the name of the Lord and say Lord take me out of this is a thorn on my flesh Lord I don't like it remove it I want this way your word so God will hear you don't don't don't don't do things fictitiously and then when you are here you're a different person when you are at home when you are there no no no no be the same person just like when you are alone in your closet with God be the same one cry to God the same way right and then God will make sure that you possess the gates of your enemy and it is given already you see little Denny there God already know if the Lord Telles whatever he he when he grows up God already know his challenges he already know what is going to make him happy he already know it's over he already given I mean look at here God already know God already knew when me and you were born I would like us to pause here but maybe I should read this for you then we close all I wanted to encourage you tonight brothers and sisters was not how can you possess your enemy Gates was to tell you that you have is already done no amount of Dilly daring is going to delay God's plan in your life it's done and we better know when I say to my wife uh I've bought you a dress it is done it's at home she's not going to reverse that I bought it it's there it's given his ha and it's her size and it f is hair and his hair all she needs to do that wedding gown is to wear it which is the word of the Lord the wedding gown is here wear it with his own Crown if maybe not the crown but what I mean is I don't you understand I just mean think of the physical wedding I'm not crowning you already but we crowned we the bride of the Lord so where the wedding comment which is the word of the Lord believe it and live according to it every day then you'll find that possessing the Gate of the enemy it just come according to as he said it will just be like brother Ben was saying drink drink drink drink and then then those fruits will just push push push push the more water you drink the more sweeter the mango will come drink drink drink drink and then a very wonderful fetty avocado will come because you are the seat of Abraham the more you believe the more you make it hard for the devil you cannot fight him with your mind and try to complicate things and no and do TI for t with the devil only one thing overcomes him believe in the word of God and just putting him in his place with the word of God he belongs under your feet with the word of God healing with the word of God just believe pain just just believe just believe that's all regardless of the circumstances or anything else that may try to deive you please musicians come brother jimm is ready already you're going to sing a song I trust that
