as well and then um amen and then we'll then we're going to go to First Peter so preserve me oh God for in thee do I put my trust oh my soul thou Hast said unto the Lord Thou Art my Lord my goodness extendeth uh not to thee but to the saints that are in the Earth and to the excellent in whom is all my delight their sorrow shall be multiplied that hasten after another God their drink offerings of blood will I not offer nor take up their names into my lips the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup thou M maintain us my lot the lions are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places yay I have a goodly Heritage I Will Bless The Lord who have given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night Seasons I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth My Flesh shall also Rest In Hope for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thy Holy One to seek corruption thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more amen amen and we're just going to finish with uh first Peter in chapter 1: 7 to9 just we got a lot to be you know this is not a grumpy religion this is not a sad religion this is not an indifferent walk this is a walk of Joy love peace amen we got we got something to be happy about Hallelujah so I think we should be happy brother Braham says yo God wants us to be happy amen so first Peter 1:7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found in of praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love and whom though you um now you see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls amen may the Lord bless the reading of your word you may have your seats this morning I want to uh I I pray this all works together but I want to talk about having the joy of the Lord you know we we live in such a a uh uncertain time there's troubles on every hand there's a time of trouble that there's never been upon the Earth as is now but even in this time of trouble you know the bride of Christ can rest amen because our lord Jesus has everything under control and you know to the believer it is the most joyful time of all ages because we're going to be we're going to walk with God and we are and we shall be not cuz the Lord's going to take us so to me that should give us such a joy such a peace such a thankfulness in our hearts because he's going to take us home Hallelujah you know we know every every Prophet down Through the Ages Every believer if they could trade their place for your place they would trade it in a heartbeat Hallelujah but you know the Lord ordained that we would live at this time H he you know he knew the conditions that we would be living in he knew the trouble we'd be facing he knew you know how how our society would be everything would be but yet in that even in this great darkness that we live in there is joy unspeakable full of Glory you know the Apostle Paul would would would say here in Romans 14:17 just to take this for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost so this is the kingdom of God it's not meat and drink and you know those things but it's righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost so now if if if if you have the Holy Ghost you have you you have the access to all joy you have the access to all peace you know I I'm so thankful we do not serve a limited God a God that has borders a God that has Ed is a God that you know you can come to the extent of him but he is Unlimited in his Joy he's Unlimited in his peace and his love and his favor and his power to heal the power to save the power to redeem he is an unlimited God and if he's unlimited he's Unlimited in power he's Unlimited in knowledge he's Unlimited in all things amen so we cannot limit Our God hallelujah so you know this I'm just so thankful we serve a God that's not an Angry God brother Braham said he used to think the father was mad at him but the but the son loves them but he found out that Jesus Christ was the heart of God they weren't two different gods you know and he realized that the Lord loved him with all of his heart Hallelujah so you know and and and when we come to that spot that God is not angry at us you know some people would be scared like David would say the Lord's at my right hand that I shall not be moved some people be scared Oh you mean God's right there all the time now he's going to tell me of no no God's there to preserve you he's there to keep you he's there to guide you I mean the very God that created you that you would worship him as present with you always that's a wonderful thing that gives me joy amen hallelujah now David yeah I just took a couple of scriptures here out of First Chronicles this this is the this is where David is is uh sitting in motion to bring the ark into Jerusalem so so the word is now in a transition it's been with the Philistines and been in the house of Odom Edom and you know it's but but now it's coming into Jerusalem where it will rest eventually in the temple so now the word is transitioning from one place to another but notice now the theme of of of David here sure this is a serious time but this is a tremendous time to the believer because their God member of the Ark the presence of God was above between the cheram above the mercy seat and they believed and knew that God would speak to them from that place so so now the word is going to come into the city where the people are and David's now going to instruct the people this is how I want you to be worshiping when the word's in transition now when I speak about the word being in transition I'm talking about the word is about to go from this world into the Millennium now we know we are the word made flesh right if the Holy Ghost is in you you are the word made flesh the word is no longer above no longer in a Mercy Seat but it's now in a mercy seat in the in in flesh right so that same God is now in you amen we don't you know we don't just this Christianity we have it's not something that's just Theory it's living it's a living God it's a living word right we written Epistles read and know of all men so it's not something we just learn and we're and we're separated from you know you know to walk with God is not something just in here but it's in here it's got to be a heartfelt religion it's got to be reality in the heart and when it becomes a reality in the heart that's when God lives in the heart amen so so now when I talk about the word transitioning because I'm talking about the bride is going to leave there's going to be a millennium the seven Church ages is coming to an end right so there transition season we are now living in a transition season where the Gentiles going to be taken in a Rapture and this same gospel the same Mercy the same Jesus Christ we know is going to go to the Jews am mean so we're living in a transition season the blindness of the Gentiles is coming on and the Jewish eyes are coming open just as when the gospel came in the eyes of the Jews were being blinded that the Gentile eyes were coming open right so now this is how David wants to Institute the worship when the word is transitioning and David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their Brethren to the singers with instruments of music posteries and Harps and symbols sounding by lifting up their voice with joy so he's saying this is how I want you to worship as the word is moving Hallelujah so it's not with a somberness it's not a funeral March it's not feeling sorry for ourselves or criticizing all the nations around us no it's with joy this is how I want you to be as the ark is moving to its final destination there it's going to be with joy Hallelujah there's going to be a rejoicing wouldn't you be happy if the king is coming into your city amen you wouldn't put out you wouldn't be putting out black flags and putting flags at half mast and somber You' be rejoicing here's the one we love here's the one we worship here's the one we adore amen it's going to be with joy Lord amen and so David and the Elders of Israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord out of the house of OB Edom with joy Hallelujah it was a joyous occasion Hallelujah that's why David danced there was an atmosphere but he was instituting this the ministry is saying this is how the people should be when the AR comes into the city amen Glory Hallelujah now Nehemiah would so so Joy I you know I believe we're living in a season of Joy this is the marriage of the Lamb this is a season where a Heavenly bridegroom is being united with an Earthly bride this is a time of joy you know I've never ever been to a wedding that's a sad wedding I've never seen the you know the bride be sad the bridegroom be sad the best men be sad the minister be sad the Bridesmaids be sad the flower girl sad I've never seen that I've only seen Joy Hallelujah you because there's a uniting coming along you know where where where there's been a longing maybe for a long season or a short season where your your bride and a bridegroom will be United and their identity's going to be changed and you know there's been a longing Hallelujah and now now The Season's here hallelujah it's no longer now the invitations have gone out now now the ceremon is taking place Hallelujah and something that was dreamed about talked about longed for is now a reality Hallelujah so I've never seen a wedding that is SA I've only seen a happy wedding you know and and and to me you know to me that Joy shouldn't fade after the wedding it should get greater because now you're entering into a different kind of walk Hallelujah a different kind of relationship and you know that Joy should just get bigger sir as I said God is unlimited so so the joy the believer can experience is unlimited the peace because he said I'll give you peace that passes understanding so the peace that God gives is greater than the limited peace a man can give or a woman can give it goes beyond amen Hallelujah so same thing with joy you say well you're just trying to get us to be happy well I think we should be happy I believe this message came to you and it's pardoning Grace Hallelujah when that cloud appeared that you know the Supreme judge would you know you know appeared in the heaven some people think well that's just judgment coming to the Earth it is but it also judges you righteous am mean just like Jesus there there's that woman caught in adultery and the scribes and Pharisees tried to get him who was the lawgiver to to condemn her but she he actually judged her without sin hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right we're in John 8 isn't that right so now when the Lord appeared there amen he's just yeah sure judgment was coming to the world but he was actually judging no the bride is without sin amen the blood that I shed on Calvary is enough for her how it's been attributed to her Hallelujah so you know I think this is a joyous time I'm without spot or wrinkle is that because you said no because he said UND depending upon what he said what he's declared to me I say Amen H just like Mary said Let It Be unto me according to Thy word that's that's just what she said or was she didn't understand how it happened but Gabriel said this is how it's going to happen where she said well let it be unto me according to your word and I think we should look into the scripture and whatever God says about us we say Let It Be unto me according to Thy word so if I've been Sanctified by the by the blood of the Lamb Let It Be unto me according to Thy word if I'm accepted in the Beloved Let It Be unto me according to Thy word hallelujah if I righteous as God is righteous Let It Be unto me according to Thy Word Hallelujah shouldn't it be that way if God said I was a certain way let it be unto me according to Thy word hallelujah it's like you always think of Christine's dad you know brother Albert's testimony where he was he was um becoming a Believer and you know he went to a meeting and you know you know the Bible says that we are Saints we are Sanctified and then he spoke to the preacher afterwards and and the preacher said well have you ever thanked him for it have you actually thanked him because in his present condition he didn't feel that way brother Albert but then but then and the preacher said have you ever thanked him that he Sanctified you and they prayed and he thanked him and then when he was driving home the spirit of God Came Upon him in the car brother Albert and he had to stop and he was rejoicing outside because he realized he was a saint amen and that's how we should be you know have you ever thanked him you say well I'm not I'm not what I think I should be in God but have you ever thanked him that you are that actually right because whoever is called he's Justified whoever is called he has already glorified so have you already have you actually ever thanked him that you're glorified or you thanked him that he called and you're Justified Hallelujah because that's how we should approach God because in God's mind it's a done deal it's a finished work Paul says that the works were finished before the foundation of the world so so in God's mind we're there hallelujah we're in white robes we're around the throne the devil's just not even ashes no more Hallelujah and Eternity is rolling on because he's an eternal being he's already seen the End Amen we read last night there in Revelations 21 and God says it's done hallelujah I like that when God just is it's done it's done amen so so if that's how God sees things I should you know we should say amen hallelujah to me that takes out all the battles because the devil tries to keep you trapped in time in your current state but really you should look your current state really should be the word we need to testify about ourselves about what the word says about us am mean so if the word says I'm an overcomer I'm an overcomer if the word says I'm the bride of Christ join ear with Christ amen hallelujah if the if the word says I can do all things through Christ Jesus was strengthens me amen if the word says I have joy peace love longsuffering Faith all the fruits of the spirit amen granted the statue of the perfect man amen shouldn't we talk about ourselves that way because we are his workmanship Hallelujah and you know if the master builder has come and said I'm going to build a church I'm going to make it without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of the Lamb made in my image amen amen hallelujah glory to God I think that should give us joy if the word says the devil's been exposed in this hour amen hallelujah hallelujah amen now Nehemiah let's not go there we go here now the word is yo y nehemiah's day here so so they uh they've just opened the book to the people they've read the law and things and and and of course the people are crying and they're upset cuz they realize they haven't been keeping the word but then Nehemiah says Nehemiah which is the um t t which is the governor and Ezra the priest The Scribe and the Levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is Holy unto the Lord your God moreour not nor weep for all the people WEP when they heard the words of the law then he said unto them go you way eat fat and drink the sweet and send portion unto them of whom um is nothing I mean for for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy unto the Lord Our God neither be ye sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength now this word strength here means a fortified place it means a defense it means a fortress it's a strength you know it's a stronghold so notice he did not say um put up walls against other people for that's your strength right or protect yourselves or just be distant from people and you know emotionally detached and he didn't say that's your strength he did not say criticism of of other people is your strength am mean he did not say you know to to to think you're better than others is your strength remember because a place of Defense now he see the joy of the Lord is your strength amen so now there's a there's actually in the joy of the Lord there is a defense Hallelujah there's a defense against bitterness there's a defense against a critical spirit I mean there's a defense against reasoning I mean there's a defense against anything contrary to the word of God there's a defense in the joy of the Lord amen so he said the joy of the Lord is your strength so therefore if that was under the blood of bulls and goats how much more under the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah listen we can go rejoicing all the way into heaven we can do it Hallelujah now I just want to show you many people or maybe just in my little brain I used to think in the Old Testament that if the people just went through the motions of keeping the word it was enough and we we should obey the word of God so I'm not saying this in a loose way haard whatever but it was was more than just going through the motions now when when when Moses was was giving his last address to Israel in Deuteronomy he would go into Deuteronomy what we call 28 and and he would speak of all the blessings and the cursings and everything and now this is not the whole list but you can read the whole chapter but he says here he says the stranger that is within thee so this he he's saying this is what's going to happen to you basically the stranger that is within thee shall uh get up above thee very high and thou shalt come down very low and he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall be the head and thou shall be the tail moreover all these curses shall come upon thee and thou and shall pursue thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because thou hearken us not to the voice of the Lord thy God to keep his Commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee and they shall be unto thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon uh and upon thy seed forever now notice the reason for this because thou servest not the Lord thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things so so Moses is saying the reason that all these curses which as I said you read the whole chapter there's all these curses these things will come will come upon future Generations is because they came to a place where they didn't serve the Lord with joyfulness and with gladness of heart so that so it wasn't just going through emotion but obviously there came a time where they they were Serv the Lord with joyfulness and gladness of heart imagine that the Lord's just came in just drove all the inhabitants of the land out you're in your Promised Land you've received what Moses said you would receive am mean you could say when you now in your Promised Land you say this day the scriptures fulfilled am mean now you're in the promised land so so that generation would have served him with joyfulness because they saw the hand of the Lord deliver them and bring them into their into their inheritance but there would have come a time where a cycle came in where it wasn't joyfulness anymore and gladness of heart but it be but it just was reduced to going through the motions and then once that leaves once once there is once joy and gladness of heart leaves the people and they just go through the motions where then that cycle will continue down till they start to look at other things and then they started to serve other gods and look for other they tried to find satisfaction in something else and not obeying the word of God with joyfulness so we should always serve the Lord with joyfulness you just think of that for the abundance of all things has there ever been a generation upon the Earth that has the abundance of all things now I'm not talking about natural things I'm not talking about fancy cars big houses travel whatever whatever I'm not talking about those things I'm talking about spiritual abundance am me we're not just living off crumbs we're not living off just little half of scripture somewhere but the whole Council of God has come open to us I mean where the book has come open to a people we have the abundance of all things you know I'm so thankful we're not living in a day where we can just reach a certain level and that's as high as we can live well what do you mean by that well Luther preached that just shall live by faith and that was an incredible work of God in his day but that's as high as he could go he couldn't be Sanctified you know he was you know you he used to drink smoke a pipe hate the Jews all different kinds of things but you know that's as high as they could live in that day and and and and people got to that height and that was it and then Wiley came along with the second work of Grace there was other reformers before that we know things were being unfolded but he was a messenger for us age and you know so they were justified by faith but then they Sanctified but it was actually a human uh it was a method of sanctification that's why they're called Methodist they had a method of living a holy life but we know now we don't have a method of living a holy life but the Holy Ghost in us sanctifies us out Hallelujah so it's not us trying to reform ourselves and live a holy life he comes and changes our appetite as I said when I was young I couldn't stand broccoli cuz there was nothing in me that wanted the broccoli but there came a time in life where broccoli wasn't so bad my appetite changed amen hallelujah and I remember many things and I see it repeating down in my own girls where where I was young and I'd look at something I never had it before but I said I don't like it and I knew I never had it before I knew I never but no I don't like it and we see a cycle continue but you know but but but when my but when my appetite my attitude changed my my my taste changed then I liked it Hallelujah amen so so aren't you glad because the Lord changes your appetite you know cuz this this Christian walk is not a suppression of of of worldly lusts this is not a suppression of trying to keep yourself from what the devil has for you and thinks you this is not suppressing nothing this is not living as a as an inter cled nun away from the world no but God changes the heart of when you really give your heart to God and give those things to God God put them in the right place Hallelujah and then you can walk through this world and there's nothing in you that wants it used to be a time where I love this world but then God changed my heart now I don't want to eat it no more Hallelujah and it doesn't matter how how how polished it gets I just don't want it just like when I was young you could put that broccoli in a lot of different ways but I didn't want the broccoli so we should serve we have the abundance of all things Hallelujah then the Pentecostals came along with the restoration of the gifts they believed in justif ation sanctification then God poured out his Spirit then the gifts were restored that's as high as they could live but now the full counsel of God is open in this day where we can grow to the stature of the fullness of Christ amen hallelujah so everything Christ is we can become by his grace amen where when he looks down and sees us he sees himself amen replicated in a people hallelujah amen so we have an abundance of all things I mean to know that our sins aren't just covered I mean to know that God actually forgets our sin he doesn't attribute those he doesn't attribute those things to us anymore he doesn't hold our past against us he doesn't keep it hanging over us you know to know that we are actually in a Rapture cycle Hallelujah that's an abundance of all things am me to know that the mighty Angel has descended the anointing that we feel Among Us not just in these four walls but even when you by yourself that anointing comes down that is Christ coming to you Hallelujah I mean when his word comes open where it's no longer history is no longer stories it's a reality from Genesis to Revelation Amen to me that's why the message is so great it opens the scripture and makes it a living book amen and you can be you can be reading portions of it where brother Bram never touches on it but it becomes alive to you why because the author of the book comes to you and makes it live amen yeah so I'm so thankful that we don't throw away the Old Testament but there is truth in it amen hallelujah and and in the gospels is even richer than ever before amen why we have the abundance of all things Hallelujah that's why we should serve the Lord with joyfulness amen it's such a joy to come to church it's such a joy to pray it's such a joy to read the Bible such a joy to hear the message such a joy to sing songs to the Lord such a joy to you know live for him and walk with himall amen hey how can we not be glad now remember you may be going through the biggest trial of your life but that doesn't take away your salvation but the devil tries to get us to look at circum ances but the Lord wants us to look at his word and what we are in him right if we focus on our trouble then then that will what we will we will become that trouble amen but if we focus on his promises to us all's going to be fine amen cuz remember our identity is not in this time right remember when when when eternity is rolled on time is no more we will not be defined by this year 2021 amen it'll pass our identity is in our Lord Jesus Christ amen so if our identity is in him then then that's who that's the one we should focus on in love now I love this um I get the our daily strength devotionals and then they you know put this up yesterday I really loved it something happened to me a few weeks ago and I'm determined by the help of God never to be negative on anything anymore to blast my heart out and remind me or no matter what it costs you be sincere and down to the bottom of it that's the truth and men just educate themselves so they educate themselves away from one another they get complexes you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love hallelujah amen that's where see you get love not a complex that I'm a little bigger than somebody else a little better than somebody else and know a little more than somebody else you just get your arms around everybody it's a basis of Love through the blood the blood cleanses amen so goes to show that real Christianity doesn't give a complex blood you you know the Lord can't give a complex the blood can't give a complex it produces love Hallelujah I like that real good Hallelujah but now we know that we live in an age where because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but God has built the believer in such a way that we come to a place where atmosphere and situation does not change who we are now I'm going to jump to this for some reason I put this in but I'm sure it'll make sense if we go to everyone who reads fast don't read now this is the Niagra Falls oh wait let's read the scripture first and the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this he spake of the spirit um uh which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorify so he's saying this is how the spirit's going to be it's going to be a gusher it's going to be rivers of Living Water not just a trickle not just an argument there going to be a Life coming forth Hallelujah now who's been to the Niagara Falls here it's a big place apparently and so so this is like to me this is rivers of Living Water we know it's a connection between two lakes and things but you know to me this is rivers of Living Water and no doubt the sound of the falls is very loud hallelujah it's not a trickle it's not opening a tap there's there's a lot of I don't know what ton of water moves per whatever but there's a lot of water and and to me this is like the believer Hallelujah like the rock that Moses smoted in the wilderness a lot of water came out of it it wasn't just a trickle member he had to water all those animals 2 million people there's a lot of people and and they were thirsty so they weren't just waiting no we'll wait for our time no no had to be a big gusher of water come out of that rock and now that Rock's a new cuz that rock is Christ Hallelujah so now there's a lot of water coming down there but the thing is what happens now the atmosphere gets a bit cold yes it freezes this is Niagara Falls and and I think that these pictures are looking at this part of the Fall so this is n so this was in 1936 but it has happened before so this is when the atmosphere gets cold it's not full of life it's not full of love it's not a good atmosphere that's wholesome to being a Believer it gets cold and we know when when when when the cold comes hibernation comes things Retreat you know like leaves I mean trees they lose their leaves and so on those that do because the life goes into the roots to protect it so these people so so these are people and normally so they're walking around here when the water's flowing you don't want to be walking there you can't walk there it's impossible but then when the atmosphere gets a bit cold you and then look there's people on the top of it you up there there if they were there when it's running they would you know people have jumped off this in barrels and died and done stuff and you know so this can be like a Believer the water freezes it's still water you following me see this is why I say we shouldn't live according to our environment they should be something that is pulsating out hallelujah amen so so that's what happens is is the condition the atmosphere can get cold who's ever been in a cold condition but there is another spring you don't have to stay in the freezer you can walk out the sun's still good Hallelujah even after our one day of summer here in Wellington the sun is still good somewhere you know but then what happens is so so sometimes the conditions get cold enough where that River doesn't flow now it's our choice if it freezes or not amen and then sometimes because of man's uh what do you call meddling it can stop flowing now this is that same for it's not frozen it's not flowing well it's trickling a bit but it's not flowing anymore and the reason is because man had to build a dam up here to divert the water to do they did some maintenance or they did something but again it's man meddling that stops the water flowing now what is the purpose of the devil the devil doesn't want God to live in a people amen that is that is that is what he wants he wants us to become formal lukewarm and Powerless now I can you know you know I'm sure we can agree this waterfall is a powerless waterfall right it's not gushing it's not going to kill anyone it's not going to you know and maybe it's got a little bit of formality because it's still appears to be like a waterfall but it ain't that right and then also it can freeze over it still is a waterfall but it ain't that so that's what the devil wants us to be he wants us to become either a Frozen Christian suspended in animation don't get too happy don't shout don't testify don't Rejoice don't let it be like honey on your lips you know how good the word is and you I was thinking in the back office about that little baby beer that got into brother braham's bucket of Honey or molasses and got it all over him H that's how it should be we should reach our hand into the honey pot of the word and hey if it doesn't get in our mouth it goes all over us that's fine Hallelujah and then people who really see the Lord anoint someone they should say I want some of that too Hallelujah I want some of that amen and it just spreads everywhere yes sir glory to God hallelujah but the devil wants us to become like this but I say no God or has ordained we shall be like this Hallelujah why CU there's joy bubbling forth Peace Love Hallelujah joy and the Holy Ghost glory to God Amen Hallelujah now again don't read amen now as I said before there is a scripture that says because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold like because so so because of outside influences people's love W wax cold just like just like the Niagara Falls there was outside influences are either froze it or stopped it running am mean so so now we know that that spirit is in the world we know iniquity is abounding in this day but it's our response to that iniquity will depend if our love waxes cold or if it just gets greater yeah amen it is actually our choice because remember it should never be you know it's like Adam in the beginning he blamed Eve for the fall but it was his choice because he went with his eyes open to save his save his wife right he allowed it to come on because of love for his wife to try and redeem her but in his Fallen State he said it's her fault and and actually said God it's your fault cuz you gave me the woman even though before he even even before even Eve came out of Adam he was lonely and sad and God saw he was lonely and said it's not good that man dwelleth alone so God was just fulfilling the desire in his life right but then Adam when he got to his Fallen State he said God this is your fault we're in this condition and so man always blame something else for the present state they're in we should never be that way am mean we should be even in spite of the condition we should still be a believer we should still be a bubbling stream we still be your water should still be flowing from the rock hallelujah there still should be a joy a real reality of God God in our lives amen amen but so brother Braham says this in the church age book he says now do we have it then I want he says I know your love service and Faith now this is from the th tyon age faith and patience you'll note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works is are are not accepted before God and neither is our service Paul speaking to the Corinthians here without love I am nothing and what's uh whatever I do is without profit unless it is done in love now you can see right here that these Believers weren't that nickan class that did works as mean of Salvation or to be admired by men they did their works out of out of the love of God that was shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost now there's a scripture Romans 5:5 that love in their hearts was God's love for his own Jesus Says by this all men know that ye are my disciples that you have love one for another the pagans who saw the lives of the early Christians said behold how they love one another so I say this the world should see something different he should not you know the world should not just see a group of religious people they should see a love between one another that is not in the world Amen because if we really have the love of God in our hearts amen we have a love the world knows nothing about amen amen behold how they love each other John said everyone that loveth is born of God Amen he says I want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the later scene or last age selflove and love for material things will take place of the true love of God now self love really boils down to what can I get for myself that is selflove but that's not a true love of God the true love of God goes out amen amen it's for someone else we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so that many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit so we can be a believer and become very hard and and and the reason that we become hard is because the effects of this last day Spirit that's in the world Amen we need to realize what's the water level going over my waterfall amen where's the you know where's the um you know is it going up or down or is it is it just constant gusher Hallelujah we need to guard I mean uh because I haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit it's time to draw nigh to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us in those dark and Dreadful years the True Vine held its love for God and the love for the Brethren God commanded them for it Hallelujah so we have a you know but I'm so thankful it doesn't matter how dark the world gets God is greater amen am mean whoever did physics or math is always the greater sign and and the one that's on the left side of the greater sign can never become greater than the greater one amen it's always greater than so so the power of the Holy Ghost of the believer is always greater than the world doesn't matter how much you stack on one side of the equation if the side of the equation that's on the good side of the greater than is greater than that that's always be less Hallelujah so it doesn't matter what the world Stacks up it can never be greater than the Holy Ghost and the believer the word made manifest in US amen now a lot of things give me joy in the word remember the joy joy in the Holy Ghost this is the kingdom of God and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first heaven so this is what we read last night and the first Earth was passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God hallelujah amen that should give us joy and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he sat upon the throne and said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write these words are faithful and true and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega and the the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things Hallelujah you know we're overcoming right now what's your current status Overcomer I haven't bowed to the world I haven't broken I you know Hallelujah I'm walking on with the lord well you say well I fallen on my face in the mud but if there's a desire in your heart to serve God I mean you'll get back up Hallelujah he that overcometh remember it's not him that wins the battle it's he that wins the war amen Hitler won a lot of battles but he lost the war and history he has gone down in history as a loser I mean just like the devil he may have won a lot of battles but he will lose the War I mean because our king of glory already defeated him the Lord Jesus Christ and he will go down in history as a loser as a defeated being as just a footnote in history as one who tried but he couldn't do it I mean cuz the devil don't have enough Hallelujah he is a defeated being he will and that's what history he will be remembered as a defeated being if he's ever remembered I don't care if he is or not Hallelujah but the believer will be remembered as the Overcomer Hallelujah we will be remembered as the Overcomer amen who overcame Satan and all of his Works am mean that should give us joy I mean we're going to win hallelujah we're really going to win hallelujah amen he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I'll be his God and he shall be my son amen hallelujah now I love this here sorry where am I and I saw no Temple herein for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple of it and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of the Lord did light in it and the lamb is a light thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it now I was just thinking now this is not even in the city this is not even where the bride dwells but even just the nations are going to walk in the light of the glory of God hallelujah so it's not a natural sunlight but it's the glory of God will be their light and they will walk in that light now that's just those outside the city how much more those who are in the city Hallelujah they are not just walk in the light but they are that light amen they are there with the lamb Hallelujah that should give us joy why does that make you happy cuz he reserved me a place in that place hallelujah hallelujah I've got a reservation in heaven Hallelujah did you put it there no no he put it there he just had to remind me that that you know you've got a place on my on my ation list Hallelujah and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations into it and there shall be no wise enter into any of it that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie for they which are written but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah amen when the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there Hallelujah that's right you know when you think about that the reason the reason this message is alive to you and I I talk about the message I talk you know the message in the Bible are one in the same because the message reveals Christ in the scripture so the reason this has come alive to you is because God is telling you you have a place in that City it's not just to tickle your religious itch or whatever no it's actually God is declaring you have a place in that City that's why there's something in the believer that be wants to become like him with all their heart irrespective of what's going on in their lives you know but there's a reason there's a reason and you know we're not just here haphazardly we're here for a purpose I mean even the even the special song this morning we for a purpose Hallelujah so we're not here just to see you know God knew we would be here he made us for a purpose and he's going to take us into heaven to after we've served his purpose upon the Earth Hallelujah but you know brother Braham says this he says for the gospel is delivered it's good news and this morning the Holy Spirit through the word is bringing you the good news that that from before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life all the Devils out of hell can't erase it out of there God's word has done spoke it I like that all the devil's out of hell hey you can run around and Shout run around the church that's fine you know I don't mind it at all Hallelujah frankly it'd be good if more of it happened Hallelujah but you know Hallelujah you know I'm so glad we have little ones God bless I'm so glad this is not great power you know I'm glad there's life in this church nothing against people who are like that but you know I'm glad there's life in this church Hallelujah am mean all the Devils Out of Hell Kinder race it out of there God's word has done spoke it but just as sure to happen as God wrote it in there before the foundation of the world Amen how glorious our heavenly father is in his infinite love and his Mercy uh to do that for us said be ye therefore perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect how can you be when it's not my perfection it's not your Perfection it's his Perfection of his word that he chose you and you never chose him he brought you into Christ and you are secured with Jesus Christ and just as perfect as Christ was before God for you're not standing with your own you're standing in him with one thing I believe God Amen oh I love him oh my on the other side of Eden amen what a wonderful time it'll be someday when you look back down and say why did I fear look at the joy I missed why should we fear why should we worry sure we have burdens for different things but why should we fear he says look why did I fear look at the joy I missed I don't want to miss no joy no hallelu I don't want to miss no peace Hallelujah if the Lord has it all in control who believes their name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life what is there to fear then what is there to worry sure the devil's our adversity he's going to come come and fight us with all that's within him but but we have the power to defeat him Hallelujah that should give us joy hallelujah amen now with all this in mind it should make us walk and talk a certain way Colossians 4:5 he says walk in wisdom towards them that are without Redeeming the time let your speech be always with Grace seasoned with salt that you may know how you um how you ought to answer every man now we know great is a def is a Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection In The Life That's from the strong concordance definition right it's not Grace like the world says turning a blind ey to sin but real Grace is a Divine influence upon the heart and Its Reflection In The Life Hallelujah that's why we can say we have found Grace in the sight of God Amen because he has turned our hearts to follow his word and believe his whole word how and and the only way you can do that is if Grace has come upon your heart a Divine influence has come on your heart saying this is my word and I've turned your heart to receive my word hallelujah so if my speech is be always with Grace it should always be with a Divine influence not with an Earthly influence you know we know many times even now you know you know there'll be there'll be bits of what I'm saying is God and a bits that's just me amen that's true just like brother Bram said so much is just a human part but then it's also you know God speaking as well amen but our speech should be always with Grace with a Divine influence Seas them with salt now salt remember we are the salt of the earth but how we speak to people how we you attract you how we speak to people should cause an attraction they should want what we have amen and and I think many times that's the problem is we we we present the message even to our own family that they don't want what we have they don't see it as something that is actually worth living for now sure though you know unconverted man doesn't want the things of God but you know there should be something that you know our Liv should be salty it should attract people that they should look at us and say I want what that person has I really want that kind of Life Hallelujah that's how we should be amen he says and I think God hasten the day that when we as Christians who believe the Bible can prove that uh what we are talking about see uh What uh that's what makes as said a while ago the salt of salt of the earth the sister said that's right the world is for the salt and when we can prove by our lives and by the Bible that our lives are vindicating that word to be living today that's the day we're looking for so the very life we live is a Vindication of the scripture amen it actually actually makes the word the word is living in US amen now I'm not saying I believe we're living in this day amen amen I don't believe it sometime in the future I believe we're living in this day right now amen but that should give us joy to see the word is put on flesh to see it's no longer ink on paper or just on a tape but it's actually living in you and I Hallelujah now as I said a while ago there in Deuteronomy that the reason that that all those curses would come upon them is because uh is because they weren't serving the lord with joyfulness amen and so you know you know and and with thankful Hearts but now when so it's our attitude towards the word will really uh mean what we get out of it and and how we esteem it if we esteem it lightly we'll get that if we esteem it as something very precious amen we'll get really what the word wants us to have so here in Proverbs says hear ye children the instruction of a father and attend to no understanding I give you good Doctrine forsake not my law for I was my Father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother he taught me also and said unto me let thy heart retain my words keep my Commandments and live get get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth forsake her wait sorry here we are forsake her not this is speaking about wisdom and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all and with all thy getting get understanding exalt her and she shall promote thee that's go remember this is Godly wisdom this is how we should esteem the word amen amen so uh and and get understanding exalt her and she shall um promote thee uh she shall bring thee to honor when thou Dost Embrace her now remember if we have the joy of the Lord this is how we will exalt the word she shall give uh to thy head an ornament of Grace a Crown of Glory shall she deliver to thee amen he says here oh my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many I have taught thee in the way of wisdom I have led thee in the right paths when thou goest thy steps shall not be straightened and when thou runstrom and instruction and understanding is you know wisdom is the principal thing keep her for she is thy life amen it's not a part of your life she is your life am mean so to forsake those things as death but to but to keep her as life Hallelujah well what's this got to do with having Joy well if you have joy in the Lord you want to keep them I because where your heart is that's where your Treasures are I mean so if your heart is not in the Lord then then your Treasures won't be in the Lord but if your heart and therefore you will not um esteem wisdom you won't think much of it right but if your heart is in the Lord then you'll then you'll treasure it you'll keep her because she is thy life amen hallelujah I'm glad we have something that will keep us amen that's right amen hallelujah now brother man says this in a personal experience with God and I just wonder sometimes if we the church knowing that God has promised to deliver the church from its sin and from its sickness and to make us a people a salty people that the Earth will hunger and thirst after I wonder in our human efforts and our theologies and so forth and our um and our great fine buildings and so forth that we tried to present to the people many years ago and we found out it had fail because we took it on ourselves to do so we took it upon ourselves to have new schools to educate our ministers and so forth we left off the real principle the real thing that God told us to receive was let the Holy Spirit lead the church we've left off as we've Lo we have lost our divine joy we have the vision is dull now so if someone loses their Divine Joy their Vision becomes dull so if your vision becomes dull things are not in the right perspective perspective anymore it becomes the wrong perspective because now you can't see the thing that you should be looking at I mean but if our if our vision so if your vision is dull then your vision is not towards heaven no more but you just see what's going on around you and that's all you can see and if you're just looking at problems in the camp then that's all you'll see and then your joy will be gone right but if your vision is not D remember this remember the anointing in this last days is an eagle anointing amen that the anointing of the Holy Ghost upon the church is an eagle anointing anting to Lift Us above all the problems Lift Us above I mean all the works of man that we can see from eternity to Eternity Hallelujah so we can actually be looking from the right perspective amen amen amen so so if that is the case then then we will then our vision will not become dull amen I believe we have been given isav as in in the lady of in church age you receive isav that you can see right I don't believe that our eyes are Meed over and we and and we can't see who we are who God is where we're going amen amen but I believe now that that that the Lord has opened our eyes that we can see who God is amen we can see his character his divine nature and we can see who we are in him that should give us joy remember isn't it wonderful when when when when God would type the bride in the Old Testament oh all those women overcome all those women got their promise Hallelujah you take Rahab she got her family in she didn't perish with the rest of the hallelujah amen you take Esther Hallelujah she overcame her enemy she did not end up dead she did not end up being killed by hmon Hallelujah she ended up Victorious amen hallelujah Sarah Sarah had Isaac amen hallelujah she received the promise though it may have carried she received that promise I mean none of them ended up losing they all won amen hallelujah now that's the shadow we the reality I mean you know Ruth Ruth married Boaz Hallelujah didn't stay a widow Hallelujah so you know if if we can look at the Shadow and the Shadows you know those Shadows should bring us joy why is that because we can see ourselves in the lives of those women Hallelujah of those wom of Grace amen so not you know they all received their promise it doesn't say and hmon killed Esther and then he became king no hmon died Hallelujah and she and she you know used her god-given Authority am Hallelujah so we should you know but if our vision becomes dull we can actually lose sight of who we are in Christ right yes amen so this is people who have lost their Divine Joy their vision gets dull but if we have our if we have Divine joy to me these are linked together this is just me and my little brain if we have our divine joy we know that we have a body waiting amen amen we're not guessing what's going to happen when we die or how's the Rapture going to take place are we going to go we know we're going to go Hallelujah God has put a reality in our hearts a revelation in our hearts this body is going to change hallelujah we're really going to step from this world to the next world I mean so now if that and that should give us a Divine Joy this is not the end this is just the beginning amen hallelujah amen and then our vision should become clear amen that that that we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen that we are not servants we are not the tail we're the head we are joint ears with Christ everything he fell air to we fall air to Hallelujah just like I think someone said about Muhammad Ali you know he would he would train and he would fight great Fighters and he' go through great strenuous battles and things but when he got the paycheck for the you know you know for the for the Bel amen it was now shared with his wife his wife never entered into the ring she never trained she never fought people she never was in the boxing ring she never went through the pressure of the battle me but she received what Muhammad Ali received when he won the battle it's the same thing with us and our Lord Jesus Christ we didn't go to Calvary and die for our sins like we didn't go to hell like he did for us amen but amen everything that he fell ear to we fall ear to because of what he did for us amen that should give us a great joy hallelujah amen we're fall an a to All Things hallelujah amen glory to his name all things not just some things you know God doesn't say some of the words for you and some of the words not for you no every Divine promise of God Is Ours right now amen and brother R says that faith in the finished work of Calvary amen unlocks every Divine promise of God Amen and he put that key of faith in our hearts hallelujah amen amen you say well you know you may think well Lord I don't have enough Faith or you say Lord you know increase my faith Lord help my unbelief Lord I believe help my unbelief like the father said with the epileptic boy there and you know in the gospels and then what did he do Jesus healed him Hallelujah that's why we should never freeze up we should never freeze up when the Lord wants to bring us higher we should never say well I guess I just can't do it and pour me in this way no no keep walking amen keep pressing the battle it'll be worth it all when we see Jesus amen hallelujah amen now the only way that that waterfall feeds water into the other River in lak and is it because it runs over it don't help none that way it don't help none that well but evaporation probably evaporates more water than the water comes down so you know it it's got to run over it's got to be like this hallelujah hallelujah now brother Braham says here he says and who's who is this he says and I'm sure you all had good times this morning at churches around and everything great turnouts and the glory of God that's that uh so that's really good makes us all happy and the best is just a head SE that's right tonight will be better than it than it was this morning we just keep filling up and we just get running over after a while just filled up so full as David said my cup runthe just running over and then you can help somebody else you see when you're running over see it's got to be more than just that fills your vessel it's got to fill and run over Hallelujah so that's why you know that's why we're got to be like this that that waterfall is running over remember we're built to run over do you know that we're actually built to run over we're not built just to be a broken system or some tank we're built actually that the water of life would flow from us freely hallelujah hallelujah so Joy should be infectious Hallelujah imagine if I stood up here every Sunday and said well I guess we'll make it and I don't know if this word's true and you know you know whatever do you think we'll be happy people that kind of thing's infectious but if I stood up here and was like that you say no hold on I don't want to turn into this that's not right so the atmosphere that we actually generate around us will produce something in other people we need to be conscious of that you know if we're always confessing doubt and unbelief and well I don't think that's true and I don't think that promises for us and you know I guess well maybe we've done too much wrong and this will never happen and you know where we came from therefore we can never become the bride of Christ what does that do produce unbel belie if there's double bindingness about the promise it just produces unbelief it produces confusion I mean we should be we should be like no no the promise is true yeah and amen it's for me it's not for someone else necessarily it's for me Hallelujah when I take this Bible and I read this Bible I always take the promises personally I never really think about well that must be for someone else maybe it is for them but it's for me Hall cuz remember this is a personal love letter to me Hallelujah and to you so you know we should always take every promise of God personal and it's never well can I obtain that no the the reason the Lord died on Calvary is that you would receive it Hallelujah remember he made all promises obtainable Hallelujah you just think when the Apostle Paul would said the faith that I now live by live you know I live by the faith of the Son of God hallelujah amen that same Faith hasn't diminished that Faith did not die with the Apostle Paul that faith faith is still alive today am H that faith is still in a people today Hallelujah and if that Faith the faith of the Son of God that he lived by is now in the bride amen I believe it's been down through seven Church ages whether they realized it or not but now it's coming to its fullness Hallelujah so the same faith that said let there be sun moon and stars is in you and I that's an unlimited Faith it's not limited it's not you know you know it's not based on you know real faith is like this amen summertime winter time maintenance time that's that's maintenance time doesn't matter what's going on around it amen it's just bubbling over it's running over Hallelujah and this is how we should be you know the atmosphere gets a bit cold get behind me Satan Hallelujah I'm not going to put up in your freezer you can freeze all you want I'm going in the sunshine I mean the devil tries to put man-made blocks up to try and block your water get behind me Satan I'm not being a little desert place because someone else is a desert place I'm going to to keep bubbling cuz I've got joy unspeakable full of Glory I mean I know where I'm going I know the blood's washed me of all sin H I know the book has come open in this day I mean to show me my inheritance to show me who I am in Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen glory to God hallelujah this is how we should be amen say well you're trying to push something on me haven't you ever had Joy before Hallelujah remember walking we say well the soul realm has no has no emotion but the nature of the spirit is based on the soul so if your soul is unbelief then that unbelief will become the nature in your spirit cuz once upon a time there was unbelief in my soul the seed hadn't been quickened I had that serpent nature in there and so the W so my spirit was based on what was in my soul that's it if I can put it this way if it's okay right but then one day the Lord found me and I Surrender my life to him and he transformed Me by his Spirit he killed that unbelief that sin nature out of me and now what's in my spirit the life I now live is different because there's now Life In My Soul Hallelujah you are back however many years I would have been a different person not because of my age but because of the life that was in me then is different the life that's in me now hallelujah amen so you know there should be so I'm not trying to force thing on you but but okay that's what I was saying people say well there's no emotion in the in the soul but the life in the soul will be expressed in the spirit Hallelujah right it it has to push it has to push out so if you got God on the inside of the inside he's going to push to the inside and he's going to be Jesus on the inside working on the outside what a change in my life who's heard that song it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life hallelujah hallelujah and I'm sure we can see that there there's a change in my life cuz Jesus on the inside working on the outside hallelujah amen he says brother Bram I shouted once I danced in the spirit don't take that no wait till that satisfaction comes the satisfaction the poor of the fullness of the Holy Spirit comes in then these Joy bells of shouting speaking in tongues and dancing the spirit will come you won't have to do it by music you will do it when you're going down the road in your car you'll do it when you're sweeping the floor you'll do it when you're driving nails in the wall with your carpenter work wherever you are that joy unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah so it won't just be a onetime camp thing and that's it but it'll be a it'll just pulsate out yes sir Hallelujah you know when you think about the Lord hallelujah and and and and the mighty things he's done glory and and I'm not talking about just an age level I'm talking about personal level am mean the mighty works that he's done in our lives he's brought us out of many Dark Places he brought us through a mighty long way in the wilderness you know he's brought us through trials and temptations and Dark Places and you know the devil on every hand and you know he's you know but God has kept us through all things Hall that should give us a joy Lord you brought me through this you'll bring me through that Hallelujah whatever troubles I may be facing Lord if you delivered me there you must deliver me here cuz you do not change and if I keep my confidence in you you'll see me through amen hallelujah hallelujah you say well amen there is Joy it's amazing how much the Bible talks about praise and joy I'm just going to finish with this comment it's amazing how much it talks about joy and rejoicing and praise and Worship the Lord am mean you go through the Psalms you go through the whole scripture it's all linked into the believer the you know it it speaks very really of the Believers just being mournful maybe for a season remember joy cometh in the morning Hallelujah the Lord wants us to be happy he wants us to be rejoicing irrespective of trial irrespective of of of whever whatever we may be going through the Lord wants us to have joy in the trial amen hallelujah because even even Peter said counted all Joy maybe we'll just finish with that scripture then he says count it all joy I believe I have it here if we can go back fast enough no I don't that's in James I believe he says count it all joy hallelujah amen but whom having not seen you love and whom though now you see him not yet believing yet ye Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory amen being a Believer is the happiest thing I know of it really is it has the most joy and it has a deep satisfaction you know in the world You' try and live on you know you want to get back to the pub and try and relive that and drunk and relive this this party relive that but there's no satisfaction to it it's just an emptiness and doesn't matter how try you how much you try and relive that or try and get deeper into it there's no satisfaction but with the Lord There's real joy and there's real satisfaction Hallelujah that you don't walk out empty You Walk Out full amen and you want more of that again hallelujah amen you know if we're attributes of God God can't lose an attribute he can't lose a part of himself he can't it's impossible for him to lose part of himself amen so where are his attributes now his attributes will respond to his word amen they will remember deep down there will be something in a saying that word is true and that's for me what's God trying to get you to see you are one of his attributes what's the biggest fear that that that that people have am I worthy and am I going to make it isn't it isn't it a big fa and plague on our minds am I worthy and am I going to make it well let's just settle that right now the blood makes us worthy amen right the blood makes us Worthy amen amen and if that blood now if if the life in that blood is coming to you and I we have to make it because we're sealed until the day of our Redemption right it's not a partial seal it's not just an anointing but if you're sealed into the kingdom now well how do I know I've sealed into the kingdom it's like the interview with sister Bruce she was a real believer she was a prayer worry she got burdened she' pray for people but then brother bah told her that's your nature God uses your nature to pray for people you get a burden you pray pray pray till is done but the devil uses that same nature against you and she you know she would say to so so that was the Lord anointing her life and that was her part of the body but then she was saying brother Bram there's no place for me to put my foot on to see if I've got the Holy Ghost she was longing and praying that the that brother BR would see a vision of when she received the Holy Ghost and then he would relate that story to her and she'd walk out saying praise the Lord that's where I got it and but then brother R said one day you're walking this way yeah and then but then then you started walking this way you walking at the Lord and he asked her what caused that and she said Christ and he said there it is there it is see you're going this way but then something turned your heart to walk with the Lord what was that that's when you received the Holy Ghost amen so you got to look at your life see so she was operating in the body as a as a prayer Warrior had burdens we were praying but she was but then the Devil comes along because her because because the devil is using her nature against her she's wondering do I really have it and and and the prophet said well what caused you to go from this way to serving the Lord with all your heart that's when you receive the Holy Ghost amen why are you saying these things well that's the two biggest things am I worthy and am I going to make it that's why I said well if you've you know if you're trusting the blood is enough you're worthy cuz it's not our own Worthy it's his worthiness right and then the question is well am I going to make it and the way to make it is is if you really been born again you got the Holy Ghost I mean and it can be such a simple thing that happens to in your life you can stumble over it like like she did but she found herself operating in the body and she didn't even realize she was actually in because the devil is using her own nature against her amen now I'm not trying to give an easy believism because something happened to her and now she was actually God was working in her life but her heart was all she wanted was to serve the Lord above
