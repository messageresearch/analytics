[6:44] thank you
[6:46] [Music]
[6:52] as a as a musician's play if you don't
[6:56] mind I will read you a little thing from
[6:58] a little scripture from Matthew 6
[7:01] a very famous scripture in the Bible
[7:04] where from about from verse seven
[7:07] downwards it is describing the Lord's
[7:10] Prayer to us and I was last Friday very
[7:14] impressed by what comes before that and
[7:17] just reminded again
[7:19] and I wanted to
[7:20] to read you just verse 4 and 5. and then
[7:24] from there I want to jump just to a
[7:26] quick uh summary of what what brother
[7:29] Branham talks about that Matthew 6 verse
[7:32] 4.
[7:33] that then arms might be in maybe in a
[7:37] secret and thy father which seeth and
[7:39] secret himself shall reward thee openly
[7:42] and when they pray
[7:45] Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites that
[7:48] are for them for they love to pray
[7:52] standing in the synagogues and in the
[7:54] corners of the streets that they may be
[7:55] seen of men verily I say unto you they
[7:59] have their reward
[8:01] that's very
[8:02] how um
[8:04] how the Lord spake that and then from
[8:07] the a little quote from inspiration now
[8:09] Elijah laid beyond the bed upon the bed
[8:13] and was resting and then the Spirit came
[8:15] to him and said go ask this shinamite
[8:18] woman what we could do for her for all
[8:21] this kindness now if you want to find a
[8:24] favor from God be a favor to God come to
[8:29] him if you're a sinner you want to be
[8:31] healed come first and give your life to
[8:34] him come first if you're a if you're
[8:37] just a church member and want to be a
[8:39] Christian come first to Christ and then
[8:42] can be a church member after that
[8:45] I like that very much and may the Lord
[8:49] bless the reading of that little word
[8:52] let's open a
[8:53] in prayer and just give this whole night
[8:56] to to our Lord and savior thank you Lord

[31:03] here as well father in Jesus Christ name
[31:06] amen amen God bless you might have your
[31:09] seats tonight so we have the victory
[31:12] you know it's amazing when we read the
[31:13] Bible he's going to read a couple of
[31:15] scriptures and I trust this will make
[31:16] you real happy if if we go to if we go
[31:19] to uh Revelations chapter 20 now I can't
[31:22] remember who said this I think it was
[31:23] maybe brother Donnie Reagan or someone
[31:25] but I think it stands quoting
[31:28] we we have won
[31:30] but yet we fight like we're losing
[31:32] the devil's lost but he fights like he's
[31:34] a winner
[31:36] it's really you know we should fight
[31:38] with one so we should fight like we're
[31:41] winning and we've won right but many
[31:43] times we fight like we've lost or we're
[31:44] losing but we've won yeah because the
[31:47] Lord Jesus has given us the victory but
[31:48] the devil actually if he was honest for
[31:50] a brief second he would say he's lost
[31:53] but he still fights like a winner
[31:55] let's just read this I like to I like to
[31:59] um you know it's nice when you tell
[32:01] people where they're going to go
[32:03] Revelations 20 and verse 10.
[32:06] I like this because I I can't identify
[32:08] myself in this scripture I trust you
[32:10] can't either
[32:11] I mean and the devil that deceived them
[32:13] was cast into the lake of fire and
[32:15] brimstone where the Beast and the false
[32:17] prophet are and shall be taught me into
[32:19] day and night forever and ever that's a
[32:22] long time by the way oh yes
[32:26] the devil reads the same Bible we read
[32:28] he studies this Bible he's you know he
[32:31] he's a very studious student of the
[32:34] scripture and of the message
[32:36] and if he was honest he would say this
[32:38] is where I'm going to end up
[32:40] so you know if he is honest you say yeah
[32:41] I've lost you know and it's amazing when
[32:44] we go back so let's go back to
[32:45] Revelations 12. um and we're going to
[32:48] read from verse 7 here because you know
[32:50] it's incredible when we think about the
[32:52] Lord but thanks be to God who gives us
[32:54] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[32:56] Christ we have the victory now we're
[32:58] going to read from first John soon that
[33:00] that that it's our faith that overcometh
[33:02] the world right so this great battle
[33:04] we're in we've got to realize we've won
[33:06] you may be in a trial right now you've
[33:08] won right you've got the victory in the
[33:11] trial right you don't have defeat amen
[33:13] you may feel like you're defeated but
[33:15] we're going to really
[33:16] change perspectives you know if we could
[33:18] really just focus in and see actually
[33:20] we've won because the Lord Jesus Christ
[33:22] has won the victory for us
[33:25] praise God Amen doesn't matter what
[33:27] comes or goes troubles trials whatever
[33:29] more we've won we're not defeated see
[33:32] the only discouraged being on the planet
[33:35] should be Satan and his demons
[33:38] because he's lost Time After Time After
[33:40] Time After Time but then he comes back
[33:43] like he's a winner like he's a champion
[33:45] but you know and then and then we get
[33:47] discouraged and we withdraw within
[33:48] ourselves think how are we ever going to
[33:49] get through these things but yet we read
[33:51] the same script the devil reads right
[33:53] his part is not our part but he's
[33:55] reading like he's reading our part
[33:57] because he's because he thinks he's a
[33:59] winner right but our part says we're a
[34:01] winner his part says he's defeated but
[34:03] he doesn't act as role like he's
[34:05] defeated he acts as role like he's won
[34:07] but many times we act our role like
[34:09] we're defeated
[34:11] Revelations 12 and verse 7. and there's
[34:15] war in heaven Michael and his angels
[34:16] fought against the dragon and the dragon
[34:18] fought in his angels and prevailed not
[34:21] we could just dance around the church
[34:22] right there Hallelujah work is the same
[34:25] God that he he was defeated by in heaven
[34:28] is upon the Earth defeating him still
[34:30] amen the devil was defeated in your life
[34:32] amen when you gave your life to the Lord
[34:34] and the Satan got dethroned out of your
[34:35] life Christ came into your heart changed
[34:38] your life what happened the devil did
[34:40] not prevail
[34:41] there was a war in here Satan got cast
[34:44] out like got cast out there he lost
[34:47] again
[34:48] he's got a very bad track record man I
[34:51] would never get this guy to be in my
[34:53] Army you know you think because normally
[34:55] when there's different campaigns like
[34:56] World War II different things they would
[34:58] pick the right field Marshal of General
[35:00] to lead the campaign you don't pick a
[35:02] loser to lead your armies you want to
[35:05] win right you don't want to man how are
[35:08] we going to fix this defeat now you
[35:09] don't want that kind of a guy you want
[35:11] someone who's who's who's Victorious
[35:13] he's got a track record he knows the
[35:16] capability of his weapons right so you'd
[35:19] never you'd never hire the devil to be
[35:21] your general
[35:22] because you're loose
[35:23] you'd be the one that you anyway
[35:26] you think about this so there's war in
[35:28] heaven uh Michael and his angels fought
[35:30] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[35:32] and his angels and prevailed not neither
[35:34] was their place found any more in heaven
[35:35] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[35:38] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[35:40] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[35:42] cast out into the Earth and his angels
[35:44] were cast out with him and I heard a
[35:46] loud voice saying in heaven now has come
[35:47] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[35:49] of our God and the powerless Christ the
[35:51] accuser of our Brethren is cast down
[35:53] which accuseth them before our God day
[35:56] and night and they overcame him I'm glad
[35:58] we're in this this is a good scene to be
[36:00] part of
[36:01] Hallelujah I can identify myself because
[36:03] I'm I'm I'm part of the day
[36:06] I trust you can say that you're part of
[36:08] the day they overcame him by the blood
[36:10] of the lamb and by the word of their
[36:12] testimony and they love not their lives
[36:14] and to the death
[36:16] Hallelujah so yeah I trust we can we can
[36:19] look in the scripture see see it's
[36:20] amazing when you think about it the
[36:22] Bible so the Book of Revelation many
[36:24] times will take Revelation is 12 here
[36:25] and in a way it's kind of in the future
[36:28] this but it's now
[36:29] but if we could say and they overcame
[36:31] him so therefore the the the impul the
[36:35] devil that we're fighting right now
[36:36] we've already overcome
[36:39] right we've already conquered our Lord's
[36:42] already conquered no I I I'm going to
[36:43] labor this you may think you're
[36:45] repeating yourself but I think if we
[36:46] just look at we're in Victory it doesn't
[36:48] matter if we're in the Lost Valley of
[36:50] our life it doesn't matter if we're like
[36:52] Jonah in the whale's belly we have the
[36:53] victory if we're on the mountain we're
[36:55] the Victor from the valley where's the
[36:57] victory we have the victory see we're
[36:59] not praying to get Victory we're praying
[37:01] from Victory right because the Lord
[37:03] Jesus Christ has won US the victory amen
[37:06] so if we could just focus in on those
[37:07] things because this should be our
[37:09] reality right we have Victory you say
[37:11] I've got this really terrible mind about
[37:13] all these things are going on but you
[37:14] have the victory yeah I've got trouble
[37:16] in my home but you have the victory of
[37:18] that trouble uh yeah I've got this
[37:19] besetting Center I can't get over but
[37:21] you have the victory over it right you
[37:23] already have the victory
[37:26] Hallelujah
[37:28] amen let's go to First John five I know
[37:30] we're doing a bit of a reading but hey
[37:31] praise God I think it's good we you know
[37:34] we read our portion of the book
[37:36] amen I'm so thankful that you know we're
[37:39] not guessing if these things are us or
[37:40] not but no it is
[37:42] Hallelujah
[37:45] first John 5 and 7 because people you
[37:48] know we talk about how bad the world is
[37:50] and sure the world I'm not belittling
[37:52] anything like the enemy we can't we
[37:54] can't overcome them in our own strength
[37:56] how many people have tried to I'm just
[37:58] going to be independent I'm just going
[37:59] to be an eagle I don't need nothing or
[38:01] nobody and
[38:03] you know and big and they think they can
[38:05] outwit Satan just because they've got a
[38:06] few quotes on their wall no brother Ram
[38:09] said you can't over you can't outwit him
[38:11] he's a Slicker in your own strength you
[38:12] need the Holy Ghost In Our Lives to
[38:14] overcome them so we can't so I'm not
[38:16] belittling our enemy we've got a real
[38:18] enemy right but we've really overcome
[38:20] him right by the blood of lamb and the
[38:22] word of Our Testimony that's why it's so
[38:23] important if you're on a clinch a
[38:25] testimony testify of it
[38:27] that's a good way to put the last nail
[38:29] in the Satan's coffin in that thing
[38:30] testify of it
[38:32] amen now we're so we're here in first
[38:35] John
[38:37] and five and four
[38:40] whosoever is born of God
[38:42] who's had a new birth here
[38:44] overcometh the world
[38:47] amen and this is the victory that
[38:49] overcometh the world even our faith
[38:52] Hallelujah so you say well you know
[38:56] just for example you say well maybe I
[38:59] was just you know I just met the Lord
[39:00] yesterday but you've already overcome
[39:02] the world if you're born a God you've
[39:04] overcome the world
[39:06] politics whatever whatever people yo
[39:09] YouTube whatever's trending who cares
[39:11] you've overcome it
[39:12] you've already overcome it so see we
[39:15] shouldn't be worried about this big John
[39:16] Moss is going to swallow us up it can't
[39:18] swallow us up because we've overcome it
[39:20] this is what the Bible tells me I've
[39:22] overcome the world
[39:23] amen and this is the victory that
[39:25] overcometh the world it's even our faith
[39:29] Hallelujah so faith is the victory the
[39:31] prophet preaches right Faith gives you
[39:33] the victory over every circumstance and
[39:35] that Faith should tell you you've won
[39:38] it's like David when he went to fight
[39:40] Goliath hear anyone yeah God gave me the
[39:42] lion gave me the beer he'll give me this
[39:44] guy too he'll be another testimony on my
[39:46] wall why because his faith overcame
[39:48] those enemies and he realized that
[39:50] Goliath was the same category as those
[39:52] enemies because it's
[39:55] the that Philistine was an uncircumcised
[39:57] Philistine who had no Covenant with God
[39:59] just like The Lion and the Bear yeah
[40:02] right so we've got to realize that every
[40:03] enemy that comes against us doesn't have
[40:05] a covenant with our God be it sickness
[40:07] be it be it be it depression be any kind
[40:09] of spirit anything that can be named
[40:11] does not have a covenant with our God
[40:14] right we have a covenant with our God
[40:17] and he said that I have overcome
[40:20] he gives us the victory Hallelujah so we
[40:23] can we can just Rejoice amen amen right
[40:25] we have the victory
[40:28] you know it's even even over some of
[40:30] those talking to someone about about you
[40:32] know forgiveness and unforgiveness a
[40:34] good way to know you've forgiven someone
[40:36] as if you're like Stephen when you're
[40:38] about to you know as many Stone he says
[40:39] Lord don't lay this to their charge
[40:41] right he still felt the pain of the
[40:44] stones he still felt the rejection no
[40:46] doubt he still felt that but he said
[40:48] don't lay this to their charge when you
[40:50] have it in your heart that you want to
[40:51] see that person that's hurt you saved
[40:54] they want us you want to see them in
[40:56] heaven that shows you have forgiven them
[40:58] right it's like Jesus when he was
[41:00] hanging on Calvary he said his father
[41:01] forgive them they don't know what they
[41:02] do he still died of a broken heart see
[41:04] many times we mistake we think I can't I
[41:07] can't forgive because I feel pain
[41:09] Jesus still felt pain on Calvary not
[41:12] just physically but he died of a broken
[41:13] heart so he felt the emotion of the
[41:15] rejection the pain of the rejection and
[41:17] the hurt that they inflicted upon him
[41:19] not just physically but emotionally but
[41:21] yet he said father forgive them they
[41:23] don't know what they do so he he still
[41:25] felt that pain but he forgave them cease
[41:28] you can't go by paying your feeling by
[41:30] if you're forgiven or not no if you're
[41:32] forgiven and and you know you're
[41:34] forgiven but why because from your heart
[41:36] you want to see that person in heaven
[41:37] with you
[41:39] that is totally different from the pain
[41:41] you may be feeling from the trauma
[41:42] you've experienced
[41:43] right right but you've still forgiven
[41:45] them I hope I hope that's all right
[41:47] right so we can rejoice
[41:49] we have the victory
[41:51] right we can forgive
[41:54] right we can actually walk and have no
[41:57] ought in our heart against anyone
[41:59] right and it doesn't matter what comes
[42:01] against us we have the victory
[42:04] amen why because because remember it's
[42:06] predestinated that the devil is going to
[42:08] burn in the Lake of Fire
[42:10] we aren't going there right we have the
[42:13] victory over hell death in the grave
[42:14] because Jesus purchased it that day on
[42:16] Calvary for us right so it doesn't
[42:19] matter what we're going through I'm just
[42:20] going to wrap this up but I just I just
[42:22] pray this blessing to someone because
[42:24] many times when we're in a battle we
[42:25] can't see the wood from the trees we
[42:27] think how we're going to get through
[42:28] this but if we realize hey I've already
[42:30] won because he won it for me right every
[42:33] battle we go through I've already won
[42:36] how's the victory coming I don't know
[42:37] but he won it for me he's going to come
[42:39] on the scene and that's all that matters
[42:41] right so if we can just look beyond the
[42:43] maybe you know maybe the internal
[42:45] conflict or the external conflict
[42:47] whatever it is and we're going to look
[42:48] beyond that and say no I've overcome
[42:50] this thing because he overcame it right
[42:52] and those that are born of God
[42:54] overcometh the world Hallelujah the
[42:57] world doesn't overcome them we overcome
[42:59] the world
[43:01] Hallelujah
[43:03] amen I think it's a wonderful thing I
[43:05] think we can rejoice in that
[43:07] we're Victorious today amen you may not
[43:10] feel it but you are don't go by how
[43:12] you're feeling right don't go by you
[43:14] know well I have this memory I did this
[43:16] no you have the victory over it
[43:19] the lord gave you the victory
[43:21] amen
[43:23] praise the Lord
[43:25] um let's just read one more shall we
[43:28] let's read Revelations 19.
[43:46] and after these things I heard a great
[43:48] voice of much people in heaven saying
[43:49] hallelujah this is Revelations 19 to 1.
[43:52] I trust you can identify yourself here
[43:54] saying hallelujah Hallelujah Salvation
[43:57] and Glory and Honor and power unto the
[43:59] Lord Our God for true and righteous are
[44:01] his judgments for he hath judged the
[44:03] Great Horn which did corrupt the Earth
[44:05] with their fornication ethic pardon me
[44:07] Avenge the blood of his servants at her
[44:08] hand and again they said Allah and her
[44:11] smoke grows up forever and ever and the
[44:12] Four and Twenty others and the four
[44:14] beasts fell down and worshiped God that
[44:16] sat on the throne saying amen hallelujah
[44:19] and a voice came out of the throne
[44:20] saying praise our God all ye his
[44:22] servants and ye that fear Him both small
[44:25] and great
[44:26] and a herd as it were the voice of a
[44:27] great multitude and as the voice of many
[44:29] Waters and as the voice of Mighty
[44:31] thundering saying hallelujah for the
[44:33] Lord God omnipotent reigneth
[44:38] it's already
[44:39] predestinated yes yes right do you
[44:42] believe you're predestinated right you
[44:45] have the victory so so so so don't
[44:47] shrink back in the trial push forward
[44:49] remember you have the victory over your
[44:52] whatever you're going through God Christ
[44:54] gives us the victory right amen I may be
[44:57] sounding like I'm a broken record but
[44:59] whatever you're going through you can
[45:00] name it in your heart right now God's
[45:02] given you the victory
[45:03] you're not defeated you remember Satan
[45:07] has lost but he fights like a winner
[45:09] we've won but we fight like we're a
[45:11] loser many times we need to swap that
[45:14] round we should fight like our outcome
[45:17] and our outcome is Victorious round the
[45:20] throne throughout eternity that's our
[45:23] outcome so we've already won because
[45:25] Christ won it for us right so we should
[45:27] live like we're winners
[45:29] not like we're losers but we should live
[45:31] like we're winners because we are not
[45:32] like that's a bad way of saying we are
[45:34] winners
[45:35] you know we're not pretending to be
[45:37] winners like Satan no we've won
[45:39] we just gotta just just enjoy the Lord
[45:41] as you go through life's journey now
[45:43] valleys mountains just love him praise
[45:46] Him worship Him adore him say thank you
[45:47] Lord you'll take me through this one too
