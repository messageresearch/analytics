please am I on the foldbacks I don't like hearing my own voice sorry believe it or not um just trying to get into this one musicians thank you very much I've got a song that I I wanted to sing the

hallelujah for the Lord God Almighty Reign Hallelujah sisters h [Music] God Worthy is the L Worthy is the L Sisters You Are Holy Holy are you Lord God Aly everyone Worthy is the L Worthy is the L You Are Holy see it doesn't take much to create an atmosphere you don't always need all the music in the world you don't need instruments to sing sometimes when you're under the biggest attack the simple word worship song would make the devil flee right then amen so if you ever sit with a week and it's just been a rough week and a tough week start singing Because it creates such an atmosphere and God comes down in those moments because really when the worshiper worships we worship God in spirit and in truth amen and there's nothing more in spirit and Truth is when you by yourself and you're worshiping the lord it's great to have everyone don't forget these moments Little Things amen so let's open in the book of Ephesians and we're going to go there chapter 2:1 but I think we'll read there from verse number eight I just been singing this song the whole week and all I can imagine is the Lord just listening to the praise and worship of his Saints and enjoying it amen he's enjoying it you know because he's worthy to be worshiped he enjoys worship he enjoys people being happy and free and sometimes we just get too sad and bogged down hey but we will overcome okay so let's go there to verse 8 chapter 2 ver8 for by Grace ye are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God so your salvation is a gift of God he gives it okay not of Works least any man should boast for you for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained what we should walk in them amen may the Lord just bless the reading of his word you can have your seats so tonight our my title is love covers a multitude of sin but we must understand what Sin is Sin is unbelief leave but sometimes sinning like if you think I always think that Old Testament man they were rough in those days you know they were lived by the sword Die By The Sword type of things eye for eye tooth for a tooth knee for a knee toe for a toe they were it was very that for that but but sometimes when you sin like like we look at aen and aen took this Babylonian garment and he and the and the bracelet and everything and had in his tent there was sin in the camp and it stopped the whole Commission of Joshua but but because he he went against the word of God but but sometimes sin is not that sometimes it's not a believer in a church actually doing something wrong sometimes it's people making a mistake saying something out of season you know maybe being unwise being like I I know when I preach usually all of you has got the Africans English uh filter on because I might say something in in English but I meant it another way on Africans and you all understand because you know the heart of the person speaking you know that there's no G within me there's no fight I have to pick with anyone so when I do make a mistake it's easy to go he just made a mistake I'm talking about that love I'm talking about there was one day I was song leading and and I sang and I was walking off and I tell this to everyone but it was true and and I walked all the way back to my seat and and a brother of the church he just said you sound real bad and I was like hey and I'm like okay and I walked on but he might have not thought it he might have just been in a somewhere else and he and he said it but how did I take it are we that easily offended that I should now all of a sudden put a steak in the ground and go I don't talk to that one anymore you know he's not as spiritual as he was because if he was spiritual and he was walking with God he wouldn't say such things see what happens when you do those things that's sin that's that's something that's just been said and it's it's the sin that blood covers the Lord he died for us on on Calvary that sin covers all those things those little mistakes knowing or unknowing it just covers it it's it's not even to be considered why are we considering it so so these things in a in a camp that we all might think is sin but can your Love cover that sin that that's my sermon in a bottle can can you overlook sin I'm not saying agree with it I'm not saying be a partaker but we were we were eating in the church here when we just started because the sermons was 3 hours long or that's how it felt for me brother V it wasn't you it was Brother Andy but we were eating a church okay and uh and and we we were always eating a church because what happened is Chantel and I we we so wanted to to enter in and get fed because we we didn't have food for for a while we were in dead churches that that preached religions and and doctrines and opinions and all those things we we just needed food so we didn't care what the kids were doing I hope you all understand now this is me talking to you as a brother this is not an official hey y me out service this is this is life so all I wanted to do is eat I needed to get fed my my soul was hungering for God I didn't care what the kids were doing not that I don't care about my kids I just wanted them to keep quiet and I would stuff food in their mouth in service just to keep them quiet no I'm not saying it's right just hear me out to keep them quiet so I could just enter in because my focus was I want more of that food so if I give them this food we're good while the brother and sister in front of the church did not think so so when we offered their kids food we got that look they were're like uh we maybe should have do this but before then we didn't care because all we wanted was more of God am but see their love did Cover a multitude of sin because they didn't come to us and say okay now brother let me tell you you don't eat in the sanctuary of God and they just left it they they stood for what they believed in they did not agree with it but they didn't come to us and then pick a fight about it so can Your Love cover a multitude of sin so which brings us to the next verse in Romans 2 and now Isaac brother Isaac had Romans 1:8 and he did it in man the amount of work you put into that sermon God bless you I I I was trying to comprehend how you did it it's it's I can't so God bless you may the Lord richly bless you for that service it it meant a lot to me on the 13th of this month I already had this scripture and I wanted to talk about it but when you did the whole book of Roman or 1 to8 I was like man I'm done I can't do anything right now you summed it up all so I'll talk about something different another angle but Romans 2 and you all can turn there because I like to if you have your Bibles get your swords out we're fighting so remember tonight you can decide which one wins is which one pull harder right I always will tell you there's a line between you and Satan and the Lake of Fire right in the middle so if you really want to get him in the Lake of Fire just start pulling I promise you that's what you're going to have to do just dig in your heels tonight and pull a bit it says Thou Art inexcusable oh man whoo whoever thou art that judges he says for wherein thou judges another thou condemn thyself for thou that judges does the same thing so remember this is not just judging this is not righteous judgment this is not saying I'm going to stick with a word and not do this this is people that's doing the same but finding fault with other people doing it believe it or not it happens even in shakina oh yeah I'm just saying it happens Happ s because the thing we have to realize here is is Jesus wants us to to to and a spul writing but I jesus just wants us to love people with his love because when we went just back remember he gift his gift of Salvation is a gift from him who are we to take it away and it doesn't matter how long that Christian is going to get there we just have to bear with them pray with them and and when God reveals and does the work then it's a finished work when you try to intervene and and put them right back in the middle of the path you actually put them back in the in the in the ditch so we have to be careful when we speak about things and get offended about things because those things could actually cause waves real bad waves and and those waves take longer to heal those scars take longer to heal because the the scars that takes the longest to heal is the ones that your brothers and sisters give you I expect the world not to like me they don't like Jesus they didn't they rejected him the religious realm rejected him but we cannot reject one another we go on it says but we are sure that the Judgment of God is according to the truth against them which commit of such things so who's doing the judging here the word so if they don't line up with the word we say Lord the word should sort them out what is the best thing to do say Lord for in the beginning was the word the word was with with God and the Word was God so he's the word Lord send your word their way and put them back on the path amen that's the heart of a Christian not Lord let me just get my sleeves all right up and climb in there and just go you know well let the Lord do the work it is his work and he's able to do it okay and thinkest thou oh man that judges them and which do such things and does the same that thou shalt escape the Judgment of God so now God talks to us and say if you be quick with firing with your mouth firing with your temper firing with everything you have don't you know that that same measure you meet or you you you throw out you'll be met again it's the law of of Newton's law third law is for every action is the equal but opposite reaction so guess what kids I always use the example but this is a great example you put a soccer ball against here okay there's the wall the harder you Wallop it guess what the quicker it comes back so if you kick it soft you can catch it if you kick it hard it's going to knock you on the nose and it's going to bleed and I've got a big nose so it's going to bleed the nose the nozle okay so and this is for your kids to remember so if you look at another child and they don't walk exactly like you walk keep quiet don't spread rumors yeah don't don't say bad things I'm talking to the kids today grown-ups as well we're all children there's no there's God is not a Granddad so I hope you all feel like children today amen take a p La we all take a p La amen so when you talk bad about something what happens then is you add a filter to them so let's say um I love using Davy as an example okay so I say Davey is a bully so I come to you two and I go hey girls you know what what Davy is a bully he bullies people he's like he's right up and Bully and he takes your lunch money so now you have never ever in your life met Davey right you don't even know what's his surname okay so just believe you don't know Davey okay go work with me so what's the first thing when Davy stand up Davey I'm going to use the example Davy comes towards you and goes hi what do you think you oh he's going to bully me so now before Davey could even express who dve is you already got a falter and a veil over him that he's a bully so now he goes oh what are you having for lunch oh a see what I mean so so so do you want to take my lunch he goes no I just was curious cuz I'm hungry oh oh cuz now you're looking at Davey through the filter but see I spread the rumor how do you know it's true because I'm your friend how do you know it's true this man all he want wanted to know is he loves food and he just wanted to know what you're eating you go ah we're eating KFC sweet I love it awesome and there he goes thank you Davey I'll bully you later okay but now what happens is because you put a filter over him because you put a veil over him and now you spread that everybody else thinks he's a bully but see Davy is not aware of it so Davey goes now to brother um Colin and he goes hey brother Colin brother Colin goes hey what are you doing because now all of a sudden the word came to brother Colin and now that falter is following everywhere yeah and now rumors spread and the influence of David being a Son of God and just loves food and me being a liar and telling you that what happened now it it's kicking him out of his Blessing to you yeah you just cut him off as a blessing because you're now judges but you're doing the same thing because you took a word of a man over the word of God and you're now telling him he's a bully but you never went to God and say Lord just show me what's going on with Davy is he really a bully right now that's in the simplest of form there is now let's take it into the religious realm there's people that came to us and say you're in a cult chel was hitting it in the car thought I'm going to get a fox lot tonight before they met me before they made Christ in me I'm in a cult so no matter what's coming out of my mouth next I'm against women I hate them they're all out of line they all should be giving up a SL blah blah blah cuz that's what brother Brandon preach blah blah blah blah and they all have this preconceived idea what this message is all about but they haven't met the person of Jesus Christ which this message is introducing amen so now I'm already a veil over me so the blessing I could be for them is gone but it's in the message realm because brother Armand always talks about bad things and always fights about this and always against who says that I'm just preaching the word amen but some man's opinion told you that I say this way or brother Ben he's always just the liberal everything's just fine that is I heard it but what if he says I like God doing the work I'm here to assist this is healing this is a place where we heal but because you now put a filter over me you cut the blessing that God wants to give you through a man because God always worked through man he ain't going to change his plan he works through us and even you praying for someone on the other side of South Africa or sending them a text like brother eat this week and say bro we're praying for you you'll never know how much it matters but if he took it from oh a guy in a cult is praying from you blessing cut off is that true so shouldn't we be more wey of what's coming out of this yeah because remember this worships God and it can always Curse God because if you say a Believer is anything that God is making him is anything contrary to what God is busy doing in his life you're against the word you're Antichrist because Christ is living within him Christ is doing a great work within him and you are spreading rumors and lies so you cutting off Christ the blessing of other people you're against the word don't ever do that that's very dangerous so before we run our mouths before we do things like this we have to first go Lord I don't understand that sister I don't understand that brother please can you show me you will go much further with your walk amen then just stay there so I've got I've got a little bit of a example um and I'll I'll I'll I'll say this one here's brother brandom says this he says now see there is no need for fighting God takes care of all things you see don't you do it just love return good for Ev all the time am some of the time all the time so give the benefit of the doubt all the time don't have a right you sold out your right to get offended to get angry to get muggy to you sold that out that's gone sorry Christ is now living so now it goes all the time so if he annoys me all the time if he offends me all the time remember these words we have no reason to do it otherwise MH this is the prophet of God When anybody speaks good about you well be thankful if anybody speaks bad about you bless them anyhow sure that's right let God take care of the rest he is the one is that right he is the one so after all we've got to answer to him yeah so as long as you know that you don't have to take it upon you to do the work for God that God can use you sometimes in the most quietest time to speak one word word yeah that would break an anointing or a stronghold on someone that the evil the enemy has put on them you can just say one word and season that can just break that whole thing open and they can meet God but rather speak good than get evil because remember the way you measure others the way you'll be measured before him so if there's anything like that that is there going on clear it right now clear it with God get that stricken off move on we don't have time for these things this is little Shenanigans we should be way past this already so here we go man I'm thirsty should drink more water uh Deuteronomy 31 and it's verse 8 I'll just read it for you and the Lord he is that he is that doeth good before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee fear not neither be the this made the reason I put this in there is God will go before you in everything you do amen if you let him the the the murmuring Israelites came up to a lot of resistance because of murmuring and forgetting what God just done and God was leading them all that 40 years through the Wilderness to Humble them believe it or not to get them humbled because he said did your clothes get old did your shoes we it did you never have food that I feed you that I sustain you that I take care of you but because you chose for the hardening of your heart to walk another way you had to walk just a little bit further wasn't my choosing we should have gone straight into the promised land rejoicing but because you chose the harder Road you just had young people I want you to understand because you choose the harder way you're going to have to walk further and it's going to hurt because every day in the wilderness was not a party they didn't have what we have a shower on tap KFC at your front door they didn't have the luxurious bed that you have they had to have 40 years in a desert sand blowing man have who's been to the beach sand gets in everywhere I just open the back of my car to fix something thank you brother Matt for helping me with that and when we asked James James how much sand was in the back of the car I had the ocean in there and it's a couple of trips and it's under the sand and it's everywhere for 40 years these these guys being in sand dry sand and the wind blows and it's and it's like oh and they R the eyes and and they look at like okay okay it's better oh my teeth where's the water Moses where's the morar where why where's the mortar we need some water huh 40 years but you know what they did it to themselves yeah because God said you can have the promised land just walk my way and they're like nope we're going this way and God was leading them to get them humble but guess what they just could not get humble there was just two that just God said let's do it and they like Joshua Caleb commission This Is Us amen so Rapture is yours how's it going to happen it's mine I don't I don't worry about logistics that's for God to sort out I'm just going to walk and guess what I'm going to defy gravity I'll break that law like completely no falling out of trees here I'm walking up but that's what I'm trying to tell you is like there's so much more to worry about than to murmur backbite get offended this is little things this is childish things we should be way past this by now this shouldn't even come over a Pulpit shouldn't shouldn't so there's three and I went into construction mode when I was busy with this and this is a Believer so there's three types of construction that I know about remember this is not all these seaps of it so there's residential construction so residential construction means and we're going to type it with a believer I'm a Christian okay I want to meet the Lord so I'm going to go and say Lord I need to change I came to a place where I looked at my house and it's run down I made so many mistake my grass doesn't want to grow anymore my driveway is all broken up my ceiling Ben you'll know all about this my my roof struts or whatever they call is all sagging everything's just looking bad I'm worse for where because when I was working in Walking in the World walking in sin I did some damage to my house my temple I did some damage brother K we did some damage some of that damage is not easily reversible so depends on how much damage you do is how much God's work is going to put into your life to correct that damage it's a construction site every believer is a construction site and you might be in three different stages of your construction with God so the first one is residential residential affects your house maybe a little bit of your neighbors but mostly your house you know brother Ben comes in and he and he has a look at your house and he goes okay we need Sills here new door we need that little bit of ground your drainage pipes oh they look all right but we can get someone to look at that but it's mostly only your residential you definitely you do need what do we call it um uh what do you call that that you're going to put on your your house deck you need a nice deck you do need that so that's all cool so that is just residential so I stay here don't worry phones rang a million times it's just a phone we all hear them every day so what happens is residential is when God is actually dealing with you as a Believer but only you so other people might not even know what's going on but he's actually getting you to say hey this is the way this is which way you should walk and hey I want that little besetting sin I want that sorted out that that lying that that very temporal things you know it mostly to do with getting around in this SC carinal realm you know cuz you got the five senses taste see and smell and everything and then you got affection and reasoning and all those conscience and that so God's dealing with that he's just he just wants you to know that hey if you accept me I can help you not lie yeah that's residential that's easy but the second one is a little bit more it is they call it commercial so when it comes to the commercial SE uh sector there's more to play there's buildings there's highrises it's a deeper Foundation it's harder work you actually get an engineer in there as well you need to have the people that put up construction sites and commercial buildings it's serious work so that's strongholds that's besetting sin that's things that you can't get rid of it goes a little bit deeper you know God is going to have to clean out more in your own area it's going to hurt but see now I'm talking about the believer God's not bus he dealing with someone on a residential level but he's dealing with Davy on a commercial level very deeper but we don't know what's going on but it is affecting us right because he's coming to church and we know that God's busy dealing with this guy because he can see it when you do commercial everybody knows there's Road cones for Africa they just show up and they make babies and more babies and more babies and before you see there's a gazillion million of them on the street you know something's going on and there's big there's big uh what you call it cranes and these trucks coming in out you so on a Believer when you look at it you can see listen this guy's going through turmoil this guy's being tested man he's going through the ringer but you can see it as a Believer but what are we doing about it are we just are we those guys that just stand there and look at the construction side and go or do we go Lord he needs help amen I'm going to pray with him yeah I'm going to pray for him every morning I wake up I'm going to be on his side if he turns back guess what I'm going to stand next to him go you're all right he says I need this he go yep yep I I want you to eat my soup I'll even eat the soup oh my it's going to be hard but I'll do it I'll do whatever it takes so I can get that guy to get through that trial because God's busy working a deep work with him but see there might be only two or three or four realize that cuz it is a commercial site so mostly the people in that neighborhood are now and again someone pasting will know about that but then you get a different one then you get like the Civil heavy civil construction this is like this Marina that they the walkway that they're building here tiun or whatever walkway everybody knows what's going on this is like kids acting out this is like parents throwing baby Tantrums in church and stuff like that things that you can see it's boiling over God is busy and they and they come forward and they go for prayer and they so and you can see everybody knows what's going on but it's a deep work and it's a very personal work so we look at that situation and we just think man they're really going now through the ringer that brother is going through ringer but it's affecting the mom the dad the sister the nephew the cousin the far removed everyone else it is just a bomb the whole family it's just a it's heavy construction because God might deal with him but he's getting the whole family in on it because he wants to deal with the whole family as well right but how are we looking at it is just him acting out or is it God getting the family in such a place that he can work with the family you need more love you need more joy you need more Temperance you need more understanding you need more forgiving God's busy dealing with everyone in the family but it looks like it's just one and we all go mhm he's just acting out God's Building character for the mom the dad the brother the sister the nephew the cousin the the family in the church he's actually working with all of us and it's a deep construction but he wants all of us to get to a certain place cuz when you look with civil construction is where they actually get in and they it's the road layout it's the it's the um under the ground above the ground whatever is on top it's everything around that area is getting built and and you don't recognize it until they start building and it looks like a landmine just exploded it looks that that family is completely off the rails it looks like a job type of thing man you're sitting on an as sheep scratching your boils it looks horrible and we all standing [Music] go have you seen have have you heard oh and this is what I don't like we should pray for them because little Jimmy just did this and this and this and we should pray I Don't Care What Jimmy did sorry Jimmy all I want to know is should I pray for Jimmy my focus is do does he need up is he is should I pull my sword which devil goes down where where do you want me they go oh we should cover the left let's go to the left is that left yeah that's left okay which come the next on no no go to the right okay we're going to the right he's going this way let's pray against this because my focus is I want him there but the moment I start turning to Friendly Fire the enem is that way you Ain finding the wrong side you need to fight that way so sometimes somebody just needs to go AR it's that way yeah okay yeah we go again cuz we all want to fight but we're heading the wrong way you should never do Friendly Fire amen never when that thought comes in reject it straight away it's real bad okay I went way past what I wanted to say but we'll we'll give you homework Romans 12 and then I'll close with this because the the what I want you to realize is God sent all of us as backup he send us his backup and if one hurts we all should hurt if one Grieves we all should grieve am if one Rejoice we Rejoice with them even if I don't feel like rejoicing guess what I is rejoicing with you am because for me my purpose is to see you all in the Rapture and and let's say this thing that I do not like hearing at all never say this never say this not everyone in the church is believer you know brother brandom said make believer real believer unbeliever hold on let me tell you something you're all going to heaven and you all are my family amen so I don't believe anybody in this church anybody on this church is staying behind amen because if I do believe that it's okay for me to see you go through the tribulation and it's not amen it's okay for me to see you get the worst time of your life in hell it's not brother brandham says even if Stalin which killed so many Jews was going to go to hell he'll still pray for that Soul though he deserves it he'll still pray for that Soul because he doesn't want one to go that way so don't ever say some of the people in the church is Believers and some are make Believers and some are real because guess what then you're doubting Who's Got Your Flank yeah you're doubting who's got your back so who are you doing you're fighting here hit hit hit a sword comes you're like who's behind me who's going to help me your head's off you you'll get M you'll get injured you get wounded you'll you'll die on the battlefield you'll spiritually go numb yeah all I need to know is where do I fight who needs me which devil's head is coming off because we fight Devils strongholds principalities powers of Darkness not human beings amen Spirits never die they manifest and there might be a season on one and jump to another one or try to jump to another one as long as you can see the spirit operating we can cut its head off just send prayer their way amen okay so Romans 12 um and we go to verse 9 it says let love be without the simulation abore that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kind and affection affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another you know what true honor is true honor is what what you have for someone you push you don't put them on a ped St it means when you said something you do it when they ask you to help even if it's hurts and your time is not there and you can in your ability even if it's half a ability you go do it honor is to place someone above your own needs and wants if you want to be a great man make other people feel great amen if you want to have friends be friendly yes if you want to overcome treat them as a Overcomer it is it is is not six steps or seven steps to being a good Christian it's one step Christ see and I'll close this about go read the rest go read till Verse 18 at home that's your homework for tonight before you go to bed go read it I want to finish with one thought then brother Ben can come up before we pray if Christ would have been offended when they gave him the first stripe it was for your healing if Christ would have been offended when they ripped out his beard it was his chastisement all our iniquities went on him all our sin he carried every drop of blood was for us he stood there in the garden and Peter grabbed the sword and ch chopped the ear of him what did he say don't you think I can call Legions of angels right now and change this scene amen he knew who he was didn't get offended he's hanging on the cross and he says father forgives them they know what they do because I have to Blind them so that I can get a bride if he got offended he could have just easily go you know what I had enough yeah just let's finish this Hellfire and brimstone could have rained that very same day wouldn't affected him at all but he didn't you know he he went to back to his house and he's doing Miracles and he wants to go and and spread the gospel and talk to him about it and they reject him because he's a carpent and son do you not feel that he comes to his own and a very personal own brothers sisters everybody family he gives them this this love and and and they just don't believe him they reject him yeah so if your brother and sister rejects you what should you do even immediate family don't agree with you what should you do love them anyways don't don't hold resentment when he walked up to the cross and he was so he was so burdened so heavy you were on his mind am see even if you were in the darkest viess place before you met him and you totally offended him with everything that you've done he still loved you he still made an appointment to come a knock on your door the day you said Lord I'm ready he was calling you all along but you just didn't realize that he was all he's doing is every service you young people every service he's knocking on your door he's just saying I want to St with you I want to come and change your life he doesn't get offended when you go after every service not now he comes next service and he goes it's me open up I want to come and with you so if the Lord Jesus had so much patience with us what should we have with each other brother Ben you can you can come forward thank you very much may the Lord bless you appreciate it thank you amen amen amen am

reasoning that justifies your thinking will be gone how you going to be I don't want to I don't want to see anyone in that place you know brother Arman kind of finished off with the people saying the three kinds of beliefs in church I think we should stop playing God God knows who is his and whatever more I'm not God last time I checked which is right now and well actually I've never checked cuz I
