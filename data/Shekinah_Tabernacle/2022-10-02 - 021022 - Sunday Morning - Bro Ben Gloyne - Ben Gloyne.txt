bless you brother Marty know me praise the Lord great to have everyone here amen uh we're gonna go to First Chronicles 20 and we're gonna read verses four to eight then we're gonna go to Second Peter uh one amen so our lord Jesus is wonderful in every situation amen so first Chronicles 20 verses four to eight uh at CSA and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time that Kings go out to battle Joy bled forth uh the power wait am I in the right place no I think it's the second chronicles wait okay I can't copy paste very well let's try this again no have I got here oh verse four I'm reading from verse one yeah let's try verse four there we go and it came to First Chronicles 20 and verse four you probably had it on the screen the whole time and here I am reading this and it came to pass all right we'll get there and it came to pass after this that there arose War at Giza and the Philistines at which time uh sympath chai the um hashathite slew Supply which was of the children of the Giant and they were subdued and there was war again with the Philistines and and Al hennen the son of Gia slew uh Lumi the brother of Goliath the gideonite whose spare staff was like a Weaver's beam and yet there was war at gath which uh where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each hand six on each foot and he was the son of the Giant and when he defied Israel Jonathan the son of shimia David's brother slew him these were born unto the Giant and Geth and they fouled by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants praise the Lord amen we've got to go to First Peter there's a second Peter sorry um one that's kind of bit of a Content actually let's just pray then you can have the comfort of your seats this morning I mean anyone got a need on your heart just raise it with a you know raise it before the law with an uplifted hand amen dear Lord Jesus we want to thank you my God so much that we can come into your divine presence this morning by your shed blood and amen Lord we want to thankful Lord we just Lord I just think of like David of old he said who is man that you'd be mindful of him Lord You're the great God that fills all space and time and just spoke the world's the universe into existence but yet and Lord we're on this little speck of this planet oh God but yet Lord You're mindful of us Lord you you became one of us you became the last of the low Lord to redeem us back to yourself Lord we just want to come this morning to just show our appreciation Lord for the Lord for your blood Lord for you dying on Calvary for us to redeem us back to yourself and dear God as we've just read from the uh Lord your word I pray Lord may you inspire once again Lord may you anoint both speaker and hear O Lord those who may be watching this as well may your presence be there and dear God we just want to ask you take Supreme control Lord over our lives Lord of every part of us Lord we just want to humbly submit ourselves under your Mighty hand we thank you so much Lord that you know Lord of every need that's raised behind the hands that have been raised o God and we love you so much you just want to commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you you may have your seat so we're then we're going to go to Second Peter and one and um and we're going to read just from verse 1 down to verse nine this is I I trust this will tie together I I I believe it well but um so we're in second Peter one and one so Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ who is speaking to Believers here Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of our and of Jesus Christ Our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby given unto him was exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust there's the original sin right there through lust and besides us giving all diligence add to your faith virtue into your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge Temperance and to your Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godless brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you they make you that you shall be neither Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins amen just want to leave the reading there but you know I want to speak about the Giants in the land yeah no we're right here of the of the you know your own Chronicles that there was there wasn't just Goliath that had to be down but there were other Giants there were sons of the Giants you know Goliath had a brother and but it was the Next Generation that slew these Giants now brother Baron would would relate to us that the last service that he preached at Bradham Tabernacle before he went on his great Evangelistic campaigns we know he did travel a bit before this but you know he preached about about David and Goliath and how he had a slingshot of faith and he was going to down this down this giant that was walking in the land that told the people that the days of Miracles has passed and and that's what his heart desire was that that people would see that Jesus Christ is alive that is not just an idea he's not just something to argue about he's not just a list of doctrines not just a church you go to but he's a true and living God that his promises are alive that his word is true and so he he went out there and he says because if there's one giant as soon as we can slay him the rest will take courage and the Lord granted that and there has been an old Roberts and the Jaggers and so forth pull the sword and we fought the enemy out of the land and shut their mouths they can't say Miracles don't happen because here they are sure God's word is eternal at flash on the urum sets the word flashed on the word that says you're my thunder and when it flashed on that it was positive and to anybody that's needy if you're a sinner you know uh you want to know how to get saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he said this in 1957 so that was as hard as desire when he went out there is that this is this giant of giant of you know you know unbelief that the days of Miracles have passed that those were just for the apostles and the Holy Ghost is not the same anymore and yo yo it was just for the apostles just for the book of Acts and we live in a different era and God doesn't do those same kind of things he went out there and slew that giant and then people begin to Rally because even even um you know historians who are not Pentecostal they're not even in the message they attribute the post-world War II healing Revival to brother Brown's Ministry he spearheaded it so he went out there he slew that giant even um you know people like Tommy Osborne all that um you know you know he was in that meeting there in Oregon with that big giant demon-possessed man came out to the platform said I'll tear you learn from lemon you know he saw he yo he saw that man full of brother Brown's feet after brother Bram said because you've challenged the spirit of the Living God you're going to fall at my faith and you know the police packed them out and all those things he saw those things and then he said in his own Testament he and his wife went and read the Bible again like they never read it before and they saw that God is alive and miracles do happen and then that sparked his ministry so many saw these Giants fall and they took courage they drew the sword amen but there are other Giants in the land that want to stop you actually obtaining your inheritance because as as as it wasn't just Goliath he's been slain we know he's alive we know the Lord Jesus Christ is alive we know he still does Miracles amen amen we know he's a miracle working God we understand that we've experienced it it's not just Theory it's not even just on tape anymore but that same Miracle working God has performed Miracles at our own midst amen so we know he is alive but there are these other Giants that want to stop us possessing every promise now when I'm talking about promises today I'm going to talk about the Statue of the perfect man because how you know the enemy does not want us to possess all these virtues he does not want us to be built as brother by Max he said when he preach that sermon he actually called it the building the living house the living God's dwelling place so you're building the Temple of the Living God that's what he really called it and you know so so the devil doesn't want to be want us to be built in that in that fashion and so you know you think of Goliath you know if you think of his brothers and his sons you know there are family traits that are in families right I know you know that's nothing shocking to anyone but you see family traits you see mannerisms you see characteristics you see you know you'd see traits that are in grandparents are now in the grandchildren and you know you can see how they how people act even mannerisms and and facial expressions and and so we could look at now how Goliath but you know acted would be the same way his sons and his brother would have acted now goliath we know he came out with fear and intimidation to hold Israel in a stalemate that was his whole plan for 40 days remember he came out said bring me a man you know let's not all fight just choose your Champion I'm the champion of my side let's fight whoever wins you know the loser will serve them that was that was his whole thing and for 40 days he just held them in a stalemate I don't know why they just didn't attack but yeah for 48s came out bring me a man right bring me man and and that's how the enemy works if he can hold you in a spot yeah then it just weakens Faith amen but you've got to see that you've actually got got the equipment you've got the weapon I mean to down every giant I mean brother Brown says you just start testifying singing doing something you'll you'll slag the lies you'll be cutting Philistines Plum to the walls your family will rally but you see if it gets you stuck in a quagmire right that's where that's where the enemy can trap you you know of Doubt is it is it really real can it really happen you know time goes on and you know but but we're going to look Beyond those things and look at the promise of God and so Goliath you know that's how we operated through fear and intimidation and held them in a stalemate but you see now and then and then and then even these Giants they're very interesting names now so this one uh supplies that's s-i-p-p-a-i this is um that we read about the original yo so the root meaning of of his name means a um uh the original senses of of containing of like a vestibule or a limit so it's like a dish that holds blood or wine but it's also so it's a bowl or a door or a gate or a threshold so so as even his name it it speaks of containing and what's he containing he's just containing Israel from possessing their promises that's what the devil wants to do so even his name is saying I'm going to contain you in your position you're not going to advance any further than where you are I mean you may have just repented been baptized you're gonna stay right there that's what it's going to try and contain amen then there's not gonna be any joy in your life no no peace No Love No reality of the Holy Ghost you just can't try and hold you there or that all you got with that brother or sister is going to hold you right there and that's all you can see is that thing that you can't seem to reconcile or make right or but if you just give it all to the Lord he'll take care of it all but he wants to try and contain you where you are and then even even this next giant this is uh l-a-hmi however you pronounced that the root word of his name actually means to feed on to to figuratively to consume uh by implication to battle such as destruction or devour to overcome or Prevail so so there's one that contains and then the other one just wants to consume you and this is what these Giants want to do these Giants of unbelief and you know Superstition and fear and you know and it's really reasoning that will hold us back true that is reasoning see the enemy will try and contain every Believer by reasoning see the battle is in the mind and that reasoning will always sound so right but it's actually so wrong you know if you could take your own reasoning and actually you know because many times in every situation if we're involved in it we can't look at it clearly like we could because we're emotionally involved but if you can actually take yourself out of the same scenario you'd give a different outcome you take the same scenario apply to someone I say why don't they just do that but you're in the same suit I'll never do that why because you're in it but you need to but that's reasoning see that's why we need to cast down our reasoning as the scripture says amen and we need to we need to get a hold of let the law get a hold of us that's what we've got to do all about being not just our mind but our soul and our spirit everything that we are our time our tongues our ambition you know you become your ambition so what do you want to be Brother David Silas said it years ago the Auckland convention one of me said you are your ambition you take someone who wants to win the 100 meter gold at the Olympics they become that ambition and now everything they do they become that they embody what they want to become and it's the same thing with you and I you will embody what you want to become true amen so if you want to become all that the Lord has for you you'll become it it's because you're fully Serenity after the word and then he can work right but if you just want to float along and looking for a place to get off you'll find a place to get off all right so reasoning so so such a these Giants try and hold people back especially when a church has been here for a while we get used to coming to church and having a message kind of culture you know getting you know we just kind of begin to fit into a mold but there's no life of the of the Lord in it but we you know we want to go beyond that right so so the reasoning a big reasoning is you know you're okay you've got a church that's fine that's all you need to do it's more than that you know it's just like if you stand in a garage long enough you'll never become a car you can even become a car just by standing in a garage you know you've got to have someone actually build you over to become a car it's like coming to church you don't just come to church and that that doesn't mean you're a Christian that doesn't mean you're going to heaven you've got to meet the one who gave the word meet the one who created all things and he'll make you a new creature amen so just saying you're okay but no we're gonna go beyond just being okay you know we can't just live off the atmosphere of coming to church you know we come here we get energized and strengthened and renewed and we should because we're in the presence of God but that same atmosphere should be in our hearts and should be in our lives wherever we go right sure more powerful I believe when we come together right because you bring your liquor fire I bring my liquor fire and God you're the Hope fullness of God comes into the place and it's just a big bonfire of the Holy Ghost burns out all the devils in trouble that same holy spirit is still in you if he's in you right so you can still have incredible um times in the presence of God by yourself when we come together I believe it's more powerful that's why Camp is always a phenomenal time right but that's the same God of campus right here this morning amen so you know but we can't just live off the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and go back into our old lives right now that same atmosphere should be with you so yeah we can't just yes you've got to let him come into you now the baptism the Holy Ghost the giant will say it's just a thought that's just a way of thinking no it's not a way of thinking he's not just a thought just like the devil's not just a thought they're both beings yeah they have an agenda you know the devil's gender is to destroy you and marry you up and you give you spiritual Amnesia amen fill you of unbelief but God's God's ambition is he wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost use you for his glory then pack you into Glory one day that's what he wants to do so we can't just say well the Holy Ghost is a thought he's not just a thought amen amen when Jesus Promised or actually he says in second Corinthians 6 he says and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I'll dwell in them and walk with them and I'll be their God and they shall be my people that's why we've got to cast down our Idols amen our Idols of Pride Idols of of mistrust our Idols of pain whatever it is where to cast down those Idols amen because they will try and hold us back and they will oh yeah we've got to cast those things down you know what is the point of living in a desert when you can just cross a hill and live in the paradise it's the same thing when people without God they just live in a desert yes you know and I think this is all to life no there's more to it than this you know the person right next you could be living in the Oasis drinking from the fountain continually and you can say well there's nothing to this no you but you want to give up your pride and things and let God take you in he says I will never leave uh he says in John 14 I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you that's a person coming yeah just like if I call you up I'm going to come over right now I think so I arrive yeah it might take me a while gonna drive whatever but eventually I come there right it's not just yes my thoughts are with you and you know no I physically come right and the Lord Jesus he physically saw Spirit his Spirit comes into you yes amen amen he says I'll not leave you a couple of so it's not even it's not even a good thought he is not he is a person yes amen you know Giants will say well no one actually changes oh yes they do oh yes they do oh yes amen people are literally Changed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he changes their nature he changes their Outlook he changes their attitude how many changes their men not just for a little bit and it's not a learned behavior but it's actually a new life comes in amen so it's not just no no you're so God's but a giant will say no one can actually change no they actually change I mean see when you're born of your natural parents you begin the natural life that came from them the same same kind of attitude characteristics mannerisms all those things same temperament and character but when you're born from above you live a life of your heavenly parent which is God himself and his nature and his characterist temperament that is the word comes into you and lives out Hallelujah amen because we know that we're not just a patched up job this is not a Reformation this is a transformation amen amen where it says in second Corinthians 5 and 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature amen all things have passed away behold all things are become new so it's not just a patch up job but it's a but it's a transforming it's a new life comes into you you're a new creation yeah amen that's right a giant will say you well you're on a journey you'll get there eventually well why not just get to your destination the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're all on a journey no you know in the Old Testament there are six Sinners of Refuge yeah right and and if someone committed a crime you know then maybe manslaughter something happened by accident they could run to that City once they got into that City they were safe yeah right then it was brought before the judges all those things but when they're on their Journey how do you think would have been you know we're sitting by the roadside someone's running for their lives oh how are you doing you know I'm running for my life I enjoy the journey he says I'm not enjoying the journey this is the Avenger of blood right behind me he can get me you only enjoy the journey when you're home if that makes sense you know so don't just oh we're all on our journey no just give over to the Lord and you'll get into that place of safety which is Christ himself amen they say oh well you know you received the Holy Ghost when you believe nothing really happens you know we receive it without sensation and no that's a giant right takes away the reality of actually receiving the Holy Ghost because brother Graham says that that sure you know we can receive it without sensation but then the works of Christ will live out of that life this is a definite change in life when he comes in Hallelujah amen oh well you just received the Holy Ghost when you're baptized in water not necessarily it's a definite experience that we must experience praise the Lord amen amen you know the Giants will say you don't really need to surrender your will over and your feelings are more important than the word yeah because no one you know I was reading this article the other day and it was actually about speaking to Children about you know because pornography is Rife in these days and and this article said you know you're going to be careful when talking to your um to your children about these things because you don't want to make them feel bad you know don't try and make them feel bad sure if they're trapped into it your spirit gets on people and they just become addicted to it but you know but there's this big thing today don't hurt someone's feelings no if you're wrong you're wrong you know and and if God convicts you will feel bad yeah and you're like but the reason he does it is because he wants to set you free but you can walk with him right but if there's no remorse if there's no regret how can you be free of something you know even some of the um some of the Nazis that were executed the Nuremberg trials they had no regret they had no remorse they didn't think they did anything wrong you know and sure that you that may be an extreme case but we don't want to ever get to a place where we never feel bad by our actions and things affect other people right so we don't want to be you know so so numb to those things no if if the law corrects us we will feel bad right praise the Lord ah but aren't you glad for those times thank you amen see see yo yo those giants will say no yo the word is not important Giants will say God doesn't look at how we dress doesn't matter if we wear pants or shorts or you know he looks at your heart but the outward reflects the inward yeah you know Legion was full of a thousand demons he was naked among the tombs so you know the word says it's not right because he doesn't like it we want to live a life that pleases Our God right not to try and gain anything but out of appreciation of what he's done for us yeah amen hey man hey man you're entitled to hold unforgiveness in your heart this is what Giants will say yes he wants to contain you anything that will contain you so you're entitled to them you know what they did to you you're you're totally the victim and you may be totally the victim but if you hold on to it it'll just contain you you'll never be free you'll never you'll be stuck and it will consume you amen but we're going to down these Giants amen I mean we're here to kill some Giants amen this morning I mean because we got a rally and take the whole land take every promise I mean so we shouldn't hold on you know Jesus You Can Think Jesus had every right to hold what his own people did against him he came to his own his own received enough he died of a broken heart on Calvary but yet as one of his last words or things he said was father forgive him they don't know what they do yeah so you know If he if he surrendered that you know to hold that against people he gave it over he he actually forgave them can't we forgive okay sir thank you you know another giant will say well people should feel sorry for you for what happened in your past that'll hold you yeah yeah we don't live we're not defined by our past we're defined by our future right and the Lord Jesus Christ is our future the Rapture is our future amen looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith all right amen so we shouldn't ever let our past hold us back that will consume us right you say well you know I live with a lot of regret give the regret to God Amen you know forgetting the things in the past the Apostle Paul would say I've done so much wrong put it under the blood let him deal with it amen yeah John will say it's all just emotion when people shout and scream and dancing you know get anointed by God no it's not it's not just all emotions no say it's nothing to it well you know maybe because you've never experienced it that's why you say there's nothing to it amen but when you've realized that he set you free that you're on death row and he liberated you and he opened that prison door and he said come follow me and you walked out in this that's right and there's just pardon written across your book of life how can you not get emotional and you really think you're on your way to destruction I mean you're on your way to hell but yet he came but then Jesus came when you knock when you could not go to where he was he came to you doesn't that make you emotional hey man when you think about how he purchase your salvation he bled on Calvary amen redeemed you open his word to you in this end time doesn't it not make you emotional amen that we are free people that is lucious from Every Chain of the devil amen amen that should make us give a bit of emotion amen shouldn't it yes it should amen another John will say well people can't get the Holy Ghost like they did in the book of Acts that's a lie amen we serve the same God he has not changed one iota amen he still frees the same he baptizes the Holy Ghost the same he does everything exactly the same as word as is just as true and as powerful as it was when it was written it hasn't changed amen this is not just a club we joined this is not well you know I had people years ago tell me well you know God did miracles in the past but he doesn't need to do it anymore because he's proved himself and that was you know what a life he's got a PR he proves himself to every generation amen he liberates the same he casts our Devils the same he heals the same I mean transforms a life the same that they live according to the word that they'll dress away that's pleasing to God Amen they'll do all those things why because the Holy Ghost comes and he is still the same God Amen and the people in the book of Acts are the persecuted they kept walking on with God I mean they did not let those things drag them down but they brought them to the Lord that's why it's so important to have a holy ghost prayer meeting yeah and he tries to derail you in some way with pain or hurt or you know you feel so discouraged just gone to his presence amen the anointing comes down and breaks that yoke amen because that's what he does that's our God and he does that because he loves us he doesn't want to see the devil the devil seek God the devil gets nothing over God Amen amen you think about okay so we're in the upper room before the day of Pentecost they're a bunch of cowards heading away lock doors okay but then God says I'm going to begin to prove myself to these people yeah and then he fills them with the Holy Ghost do you think that wouldn't work do you think they would have would have wanted to go back as a coward now they're filled with the now now they know their sins are washed away they're the life and the lamb has come unto them and then and then the Sanhedrin comes against them and then they just say well should we serve God or man then they go and have a prayer meeting and God fills them again and gives them overcoming power against what the devil just put upon them and then so as they're walking with God God proves himself in their walk yes Hallelujah Peter's in prison he gets LED out of prison you know yes all those things happen and then even James got beheaded but the people still rejoiced in their Lord because God had used him and he was done right there's nothing can take our lives till God's finish with us upon the Earth but the thing is God allows us to go through trials and struggles because he wants to show himself in those things but when when the devil tries to put that upon us we're going to give it to God saying Lord this is what the enemy is trying to do in my life he wants to destroy me but Thou Art God why do the Heathen raging of Imagine a vain thing you know and then he comes down and fills us and gives us a you know a renewal a re-baptism of the Holy Ghost gives us strength to keep facing the enemy Amen to the devil you know if the devil really had a couple of brain cells he would leave all of God's children alone because all he is doing is actually actually Allowing God to come and minister to them and pour himself in and to prove him and to show himself but you know the devil's got no clue he thinks he can destroy a child of God he cannot you say well I'm going through Grievous you know trials at the moment but the Lord knows what we can bear we may not know what we can bear but he knows what we can bear amen but always look for that way of Escape in every Troll and that way of Escape is the Lord right don't keep it all because remember when they were brought before the Sanhedrin and were threatened Don't Preach anymore in his name that was intimidation trying to hold the apostles that was a giant there of intimidation but then they went and had a prayer meeting so they looked for their way of escaping that Troll and that wave Escape is always the Lord Jesus so they went to him in prayer and the Lord broke that fair intimidation off their lives filled them with the boldness and they just continued on preaching and that would have even made them stronger than they were before that trial right because they realized hey the devil tries to do these things to us but our God is greater and our God gave us more strength than we even realized we had before praise God praise the Lord amen so he still does everything the same amen people say well Jesus just takes you as you are and you don't need to change he does take you as you are yeah but he doesn't leave you the same way everyone you read through the gospels everyone who came into the prince of God they didn't stay that same way that's right amen Legion didn't stay the same way the woman at the well didn't say the same way the woman caught an adultery didn't stay the same way Peter James and John didn't stay the same way amen they are all changed amen and yeah people say well you don't need to change well actually it's the law that changes you if you're willing to be changed amen yeah amen you know pride is such a giant this is such a prideful age yes I'm not I'm not just talking about different flags now I'm talking about Pride in general you know we should be able to be corrected no matter who we are right if and it doesn't matter how gifted we are if we are if we cannot be correct that it shows we do not have the right Spirits yes right and we shouldn't even be there in the first place I mean not to pick on the band but there's a lot of people in the band but you know you know if but but anyone here if if we can't take advice and guidance then we shouldn't be in that position right it's the same thing you know even in a work situation your manager comes and talks to you about something you know you say no you just bet him there's going to be problems he said hold on but he but he actually wants to come or she wants to come and say look we need to work through this you know and if you can say okay right let's walk through it you know let's work through this let's look for a solution let's make this better then you'll continue on but but if people put Roblox up well there's trouble so we want to really look at now when we look at the Statue of the perfect man actually I'm going to read this so brother bam says it's a marriage and divorce he says now job and those characters with David so David's Mighty Men that's through the Giants see with David a little old fellow but they seen the man was um um they seen that God was in him and David they know he is coming into Power someday one slew them other five brothers of glass into um a single hand of one kill 300 men when some women were picking beans for dinner the Army had gone away he took a spare and killed 300 men Philistines seek character why they stayed right by David they know the anointing was upon him and they knowed he was coming into Power a pure picture of the church today that will stand by the word we know it's going to be made Vindicated we know it's coming into Power someday he was a fugitive from the rest of the nation but they know it he was coming into power we know he's coming into power too so we'll take that word and stand right there no matter what it costs if we have to cut Philistines jump in a pit killer and as when did we go anyhow because that's the way God designed it to be amen we look for character and this is what God's looking for in this day character amen amen not not just human character that we're born with but god-given character and this is so important because if you really look at the Statue of the perfect man which we're going to go briefly through now is that it's all about attitude attitude is so important right so so Brother Bear even says that you know he you know he's praying he says God take away all Folly make a sincere knowing we must answer at the Judgment of God someday and our attitude towards him and his word now will determine our Eternal destination so it's our attitude not what we know about our attitude means everything yeah amen so if we have the right because if we have the right attitude towards the Lord Jesus then we have the right attitude towards one another am I just like if we love him we'll love one another right amen so it's always that way so now it's so important when we look into this now because God says we're going to be built into this image now I want to make this clarifier in the beginning where brother Ram says in a guide so this is this isn't the message after we preach the statue of the perfect man he says now don't forget now as always this that there that these are the things that build the servant of Christ see Faith first and virtue now remember the Holy Spirit cannot cap the building of god Till these things are operating by the spirit no matter what you are see those are the things that build the body of Christ see those things now don't forget that that this here is first is your faith virtue knowledge so forth to be added to it until the complete statue of Christ is made manifest and the Holy Spirit comes upon it and seals it as one body these things must be therefore Jesus said by their fruits they are know and see fruit you cannot bear fruit without these things to Bear it in you and then when you when all this takes place all the worldliness and ungodlin and so forth and then all the unbelief is cast out then all the things of the world has passed away than this nothing but a new creature in Christ and and then Ephesians 4 30 is grieved not the holy spirit of God whereby we're seal to the day of your Redemption sealed into the kingdom of God now don't forget that keep that in mind now take these things first and the ceiling is the Holy Spirit the cap that seals us into the body all right so so if you have the Holy Ghost you have these virtues in you see you don't get bought tits see brother bam and that sermon he says you gotta you become born again then you get Faith and you build up now that birth is a sanctification birth because you don't receive the Holy Ghost twice right you don't receive the Holy Ghost and you build into the image of the perfect man then you receive it again right you receive it once yeah but you see people coming and and and and and we have to let God build us how he wants to build us right we cannot see we cannot just come along and just you know absorb some quotes and some scriptures but our Nature has not changed see and this is why it's so important that because if we really are kept with the Holy Ghost we can down every Giant amen right and if there's a longing in our heart amen that these Giants are not going to hold us back no more Pride's not going to hold us back pain misunderstanding discouragement you know Superstition whatever it may be yeah you know those things feelings are not going to hold us back no more these things will not contain us but we're gonna get every promise that's in the Bible for us now don't fall asleep on me just now if we need to stand up we'll stand up don't do a headstand you'll do a handstand whatever you know but listen this is very important because the devil just wants the lowest to sleep and just think well just because you say God's in a prophet you go I'm gonna Rapture that's got nothing to do with it maybe you're going to become one with the living word amen one with the scripture that when people see you they see a living Bible and word and indeed it's so important it's not just well I'm a Christian they're lost and I'm better than them that's the wrong attitude no but people should see a living Bible and if they they should be able to see these virtues manifested amen now Faith this is the foundation we know that that faith is the faith in the word see people can have their faith in the wrong thing you know they could have their faith in a man that's why so many people be disappointed because they've made brother Branham God but he's not God he's just a prophet right the only person who's never failed in life is our Lord Jesus Christ God himself he's the unfailing one but people get so absorbed in the character of the prophet and they you know then they get disappointed in the man then they leave but it's because they're worshiping the wrong person though they say they're worshiping Jesus they're actually worshiping William Branham so they're worshiping the wrong man but we worship the Lord Jesus Christ here amen where the Bible that has preeminence right amen and everything brother man preached we can find it in the scripture that's why it's so important you hear a message find it in the scripture yes amen amen yeah I I promise you you'll find it when he preaches major Doctrine it'll be in the scripture amen so now faith is the foundation that faith has got to be faith in the word amen and it's a real it's a real born-again Faith it's not just a human faith and it produces our faith is the foundation amen amen now because we're going to realize that we can come up to the altar we can say Lord forgive me and have a great experience of sanctification where the Lord cleanses out a person and those and we have a great time shouting screaming running around and all those things are important and you can have those experiences all the way through your walk right we don't just have a well it used to be kind of a walk with God no he's The Great I Am he's the same yesterday today and forever and he still does those things for us now right we should stay in our first love Amy we should stay where God can speak to us and and change our hearts and mold us and Matt so if we feel like shouting we can shout right man this is not a lecture theater I've sat in too many lecture theaters in my day I didn't know when to quit University I should have got out a lot earlier than I did but you see I've sat in a lot of dead lectures and even a lot of dead religious lectures you know but it's got to be more than that but the spirit of God's going to come and anoint that word to our hearts amen and make it live sir a real faith that the word is right and that's why the devil doesn't want people to have that Foundation well how do you not try it's written over 2 000 years ago it's been translated so many times look at this and this and look at what text you uses the base and how do you know they translated it right and no it's all it's all unbelief that the devil does not want us to have faith in this word now if you think about it do you believe God corrects your life when you're wrong they're really correct no if he keeps his hand upon you don't you think he could keep his hand upon his own work don't you think that he would actually because remember he has obligated to every man woman and child upon the planet that if they really have a hunger and a genuine desire is there really a god then he is obligated to leave something upon the Earth that people can come to and meet him through and remember we don't worship God through a church that's the that's the fallacy of denomination they think they're worshiping God because they go to a church though we worship God through the word because he is his word amen right so so you think of God if God corrects you and I when we put our foot wrong right don't you think he'll keep his hand upon his word to give us the truth of the scripture amen amen amen but that's a giant that holds people back you know they jump on the internet look at all these archaeologists all these things they claim Moses wasn't real and this is written here it's not even written at that time all this nonsense you know but we know the word is true because what the word promises it manifests amen right when we look at the word it says if you repent in a baptize baptized name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost who's received the Holy Ghost who's come that way maybe he got baptized in titles but then when you really got baptized the right way then God began to work like never before see that is the word proving that it is that it is right amen yes amen truly so we we're going to realize that just coming up having a great sanctification experience that's only you've just laid the foundation we don't just want to stay there amen but we're building a house yep but it's the faith in the word of God that's the foundation of Christianity hey man that's our foundation then we begin to grow amen see by the see but it's all about attitude because it says that um Amos three and three how can two walked here on this they'd be agreed so if you if you can't agree with the word then how can you walk with the word see that's why we've got to agree with the word and then we walk with the Lord by that way yeah right so if the word is contrary to what we think and how we feel how we've been raised we're to lay that aside and walk with the word amen amen amen amen amen I used to wear stabbings yeah quite a lot but then the Lord convicted me said you're naked off yeah here came long pants that's it and I'm happy in the tropics if I'm in the here where it's freezing wherever you know that doesn't bother but but because the word says it's not it's not modest right it's actually nakedness if you look into the scripture if you're a Bible reader you'll know that right so so it wasn't well my culture says no I look like an oddball no praise the Lord Robert's pleasing to God here we go you know so no but then now you've got to add to your faith virtue it's good if we believe the word is true right amen that he's taking that Stony heart out of us so he's given us a heart of Flesh to actually say yes the word is right but then we've got to add to our faith virtue now I just want to preface this right now this is not humanly adding something so this is not well I have to act a certain way therefore I'm going to change my behavior my own strength to change you know it's this is not how this works this is God adding it remember we are God's construction site right we are like a building a well into the scaffolds there's you know God is building and working and things that's how we are yes we're not our own workmanship we are his workmanship right and that's the big problem with religion is man has tried to be their own workmanship yeah let me fix you no no let God that's why it's so important to pray yes let him do it amen amen praise God so we're going to add virtue now now that virtue brother Brown says doesn't just meaning living like a virtuous life like a holy life but that virtue is actually strength you know when he was going to drive his house to raise or to heal uh well heal first but then to raise uh dryas's daughter right there's the one with the blood as you came through the crowd touched him of His Garment and then he stopped and says who touched me because I perceived strength came out of me yeah and she was made whole by that strength now now we all have virtues here we've got to have if we can't if we don't have it we can't give it right you can't give what you don't have so so in order to give virtue because because where does God work through his people right the word comes into you then it lives out of you right we need god with skin on sometimes oh yes Hallelujah just like brother Brown tells the story of a kid in a storm there's lightning flashing oh sometimes without girls and things the wind's howling and you know storms whatever they come into our room we're scared see that see they want a bit of stability oh no everything's okay I'm Place snoring away cutting some hardwood on my side of the bed you know but you know we're there so it's okay BC it has to be we have to have a virtue or a strength that people can actually receive and be strengthened by hallelujah amen we're going to have we have that kind of virtue where someone looks at us as a Christian see and they see that actually they can draw from our lives it's not like we're we're you know if someone doesn't have any virtue that people try and draw strength from that life they don't get anything out of it like going to the bank and trying to withdraw money and insufficient funds see but if you have virtue in you I mean that someone can look at look upon you as a Christian and and and actually say this person lives a stable sane life see how can someone look at us and say oh they're a Christian but tomorrow they'll see us out in sin see there's not much virtue that you can draw out of an unstable life like that well where we can be singing shouting one day but the next day we you know people can see us do all kinds of things so you can't draw strength in that kind of a life see that's not the right kind of virtue there amen but if someone can look at you and they can see that virtue that that here's a person who's stable who's sane who's loving who's considerate who is who's loving the Lord week in week out praise a lot you can draw from that life where they go through a trial they may be heavy under the trial but they're still believing they're still walking with God they come out the other side they're rejoicing there they go through another hard thing and you can see that person say well if that person can do it by the Lord's Grace I believe I can go through it too I mean if that person can keep walking with God then I believe when trouble strikes me I can walk with god what is that person doing drawing virtue out of that life drawing strength because what is virtue virtue's strength that is power yeah amen so if we can be that way we're a you know be a sane sensible Christian who conducts themselves as a child of God where the things are going fine or not fine or through a trial or through a you know you go through a trial or a hardship then people can draw virtual strength out of our lives so I've got to have the right kind of virtue right you know we draw strength out of you know our lord Jesus here is a great he is the great Fountain of virtue and we read in the gospels how he overcame and he surrendered his life In The Garden of Gethsemane and all those things we draw strength oh yeah do you draw strength out of those kind of stories why because it's virtue in him that we can draw from so if it's the same way with him wouldn't it be the same way with us we're about it but you see it's attitude see if our attitude is right see if attitudes wrongly well praise God I don't care what people think about me it's their own problem you know I can do what I want to get you know they should not externalize responsibility you know all those kind of things no hold on we are responsible for one another my actions will affect you not just by standing here but in everyday life my actions will affect you that's right right but so so if our attitude is right to be Lord I want to live a life in such a way that my children can see actually what I what I believe is actually my life it's not just on Sunday where I put on a tie and I've got to put this shirt on and you know you know and put on some kind of church face stuff they should say I'm a Christian weekend week out and the good times and the bad time I pray they do I really do but you know but but that way they can draw strength yeah amen it should be the same thing with the honor remember we want to kill some Giants we need character right all right man now you've probably already got these things you can just Rejoice but you know but when you've got real faith that the word is right then add to it virtue right because some people they can be in drugs they say yeah the Bible's True Praise the Lord I believe it I believe from cover to cover the maps the concordance the whole thing but there in the world doing all kinds of things or maybe someone has got a temper to fight a buzzle you know you you just do something the wrong way they just roll up and but yeah they're professing to be Believers there's not virtue in that life yeah see we've got to have the right kind of virtue now I just want to say this right now too how long does it take me to grow into this statue well how long does it take you to die to yourself right because when God accepts a life then he seals it that's it so this is not a this is not a seven month program you know oh well we yeah you know Easter's in April so we're gonna have a whatever month program that we're gonna be ready no no no how long does it take you to actually surrender your whole being over that you're willing now knowledge so so once you've got that right kind of um virtue you've got to have the right kind of knowledge now we're going to have the knowledge to believe that God cannot lie see see there's worldly knowledge and then there's Supreme knowledge there's there's a knowledge of God so when it speaks of knowledge it doesn't mean now you should be able to recite every scripture or recite every message that's not the kind of knowledge no it's it's Godly knowledge right and that knowledge is is actually all about attitude as well see it's it's a knowledge that God cannot lie that his word is true don't fall asleep on me he his word is true and it is right and God what God said he's able to perform that's the right kind of knowledge see we should have the right kind of knowledge I'm going through a trial but he's going to get me out I'm in my family maybe going Wayward but he's going to bring them home amen he promised them to me they're gonna come I may be sick but I believe he's going to heal me I may have trouble in my life but God's gonna take care of the trouble right that's the kind of knowledge he'll never leave him nor forsake me right that's the right kind of knowledge you add to your virtue amen because if you've got the right kind of virtue that people can draw strength out of your life it's because you've got the right kind of knowledge all right that God's word is true amen and he's able to perform that which he has promised amen say it's knowledge to judge if the word is right or wrong right and and so our knowledge should be or our judgment should be the word is always right it's right it's always right so it's so so my feelings are wrong if they're contrary to the word that's right right my Outlook is wrong if it's contrary to the word you know so everything of its contrary to the word it's wrong if you have the right knowledge then you can add it to your virtue amen amen but but you know see it's all about attitude like I said about the Bible people say it's been mistranslated it's been wrong you know it's wrong and different things how can you know it's actually right that's the wrong knowledge that's right well I read this website the other day this person said this how do you know this person how do you know what kind of Life they have right you know and but yet there's a whole bunch of people here saying no the word is true we have Godly knowledge we've seen it live amen amen but if you try and add the wrong kind of knowledge to your virtue into your faith then it will make the building crumble see it's got to be Godly kind of knowledge not worlding I see see people have an attitude well you can only understand the Bible if you know all the historical and cultural contexts of that text before you can understand it correctly that's not how God works if you needed to understand those things that would have been in here right yeah no believe the word how it's written amen so it's the right kind of knowledge to have is that the word is always right and God is able to perform that which he has promised amen amen and then when you have all that see and and then his knowledge is also I have come to do thy will o God see it's not just your knowledge the Bible is right but then you have the knowledge now I've come to do your will so not my will but thy will be done amen see and so with that now with the father's word see Jesus said so so Jesus had Supreme knowledge right and his knowledge was I've come to do thy will o God and see what the father's word he defeated every devil heavens and earth will pass away but the word will not see when you've got that kind of knowledge he says then vulcanize it with your faith and your virtue now vulcanization is when you get two bits of rubber and then you have a sulfur um yo assault with an accelerator and then you heat it between 140 and 160 degrees and it actually melds them together so it's not like who's ever who's ever fixed a tire puncture yeah I did yeah good yeah yeah I've done a few but see all that is as a as a patch with some glue that's all it is so it doesn't vulcanize so there's actually so so there's the tube there's the patch and there's glue between it it's not it's not actually melded together by heat so that patch can be busted right there's actually a pressure can come or whatever and that and yeah and that puncture can blow again but if but if it's been vulcanized on there's actually no gap between the tube and the patch because the heat of God Now cover vulcanizes it together right because we have the right temperature I mean that's why it's so important to say Lord with the fire of your Holy Spirit add your virtue into my life I mean because that fire will burn out all the drops of what we think right and it'll vulcanize your faith The Virtue into your face it's like Lord that same heat while I'm in your oven oh God pouring now amen your knowledge burn out my thinking of what I think you are and change it into how you are that's why it's so important we can have such a bad misrepresentation of God by thinking God is like our natural father but he is not like our natural father one but there may be a but like our fathers were Godly but that's not his whole character of God well that's why he said Lord show me your character show me your nature see you get into the fire of God he'll vulcanize that knowledge where he's a loving father he's a god of stability he's a god of vision amen he's not just leaves you wandering along helpless amen but he's a God who protects he's a God who cares he's a God who understands amen surprise the Lord so we need that vulcanization see vulcanized it with your faith and your virtue let the holy spirit bond them together see you cannot advert your knowledge or any of these virtues by the glue of human ability you know people think well I've got to live a virtuous life well I better clean my life up myself you know out of but if it's just human ability it's not going to work but if it's a change in desire in your heart yes then those things will go hey man Hallelujah praise the Lord see patience people think well I need to be patient now because patience is one of the virtues so I need to try and learn patience or practice it it'll never work that's right you know it'll never work because there'll be a bit where you had a bump on the road and that and that patch will burst right it's the same with the knowledge of our Lord Jesus see it should be not my will but thy will be done I have come to do thy will o God I mean see some people they get angry at God when things go wrong they think God why is this happening this is wrong and see the reason is is because they have the wrong kind of knowledge see Jesus was was rejected he died of a broken heart he was misunderstood he had a bad name if there were websites written in those days oh boy the stuff that would have been written about hammering about John the Baptist all the apostles that would have been character assassination all the day long just like they do today but you see so but you see the thing is though he did not get angry because remember he was led right he says the sun could do nothing to the father shows him and what the father shows and the son does likewise so he knew that yo so when he went to Calvary he was led to Calvary right yeah but he never got angry at his father when things went wrong you know humanly it looked like it was going wrong why am I in this storm why am I hungry why I wouldn't have a place to lay my head all these things no he never he never got angry because he said his attitude was I've come to do thy Willow God because he had Supreme knowledge see the reason people get angry at God when they go through trials is because they don't have the right kind of knowledge they think of God as an errand boy now even most people got children here you say can you please go do this yes and they don't do it I can't you just you just don't understand you get a bit upset why didn't you go do it yeah now people apply that same kind of thinking to God but God I prayed for healing weren't they heal God I prayed for this and it still hasn't happened and people get angry why am I in this trial and this is this is basically God it's your fault that's the wrong kind of knowledge amen but you could always be always you know have always have the right attitude Lord you know what's best for me you know the path that I should take and you know that this is actually working for my goodness amen you know people can get annoyed at God because they pray and it's like things are going in the opposite direction down their prayers you know I pray for their salvation that's you know I've prayed this long and it's not happening it's not fair it's like basically like saying to one of the girls why have you done this yet I asked you to do it it's the wrong kind of knowledge hey man he's not an errand boy he's the Lord God Almighty and he's interested in your character being his character that's what he's interested in he'll Rapture people that manifest all that he is in his character amen see we should never see that's not a surrendered attitude see a surrendered heart is I have come to do thy will o God see isn't that a surrendered heart speaking Yeah amen when a surrendered heart prays the conclusion is always thank you Lord you know what's best for me I'm trusting you that's how we should be amen if you've got that kind of knowledge let the Holy Ghost vulcanize it to your virtue Hallelujah amen but then we come up the come up the pyramid or you know his brother van called it of temperance you got to add Temperance now Temperance is not just speaking about well you know abstaining from alcohol so I believe if you really got the Holy Ghost you you can't be a drunker because that's contrary to the word right you won't you know you'll be free of those things so so it's more than just that kind of temperance but it's actually a control of character see at Temperance to it see 10 see Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you so start riling back you know they gave me this I'm going to give it back to them I'm gonna they're gonna learn a lesson that's all that kind of they said that against me I'll show them I'll tell everyone about it all these keyboard worries it's not even a pistol Jewel or a you know whatever anymore no it's people get it people sharpen their keyboards and they sharpen their smartphones and you know that's not temperance do you know what they said about me the other day that's not temperance it should be a soft answer always turns away Wrath that's what the scripture says amen see a real Temperance is to speak with a Godly love of kindness see is that the way you want to be when you rolled upon roll not back let him be your examples it's the right kind of attitude you know we can't see see Temperance has got to be the right so you've got to vulcanize the right kind of temperance see like like um you know when they say if they'll be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it and he and Jody was God but he had Temperance when they call them Beelzebub he said I forgive you for that's right they pulled handfuls of bed out of his face spitting his face come off the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing when he had the gift he knowed all things for he was the fullness of God here bodily uh they had seen him before Miracles by telling people what was wrong with them and so forth like that they put a rag around his head uh like that around his eyes had him on the head with a stick prophesy tell us who hit you will believe you see he had Temperance now if you've got that added to your faith but if you still blow up and Sass and fasten stew and carry on you can't add that that will actually tear the whole building down see it won't vulcanize you can't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it won't work see because the wrong kind of temperance is not the temperance of Jesus Christ himself that's the see his Temperance we need to add well I have every right to tell them what I think about them hold on what about turning the other cheek yeah amen yeah see we have the right kind of temperance see sometimes you think why don't we get further with God because there's Giants of reasoning holding us back see if we had the right kind of attitude then those things wouldn't hold us back from getting the right kind of temperance amen see so when you have when you have that kind of temperance turn the other cheek amen then add it to your file yeah price a little I know I'm going a bit methodically but we're just going on a walk today because we're going to have the right kind of character right there are giants that are holding us back not just as a church but as individuals and we want to down those giants we will not be contained I will not be contained by a Superstition unbelief whatever it may be I will not be contained the same God that fell in the book of Acts is the same God today and I believe he does the same kind of things today and we should not settle for anything less than what we read in the book of Acts amen I believe that amen amen so we want to have the right kind of want to be built the right kind of way because God is looking remember when God raptures a people he's not looking for just a he's not even just looking for a list of Miracles behind their name he's looking for his character and a People amen right but we need that same God to make us into this image amen but we don't just you know and I say we won't be containers because we're not here just to become formal and just to drift along women now once you've got that you've got to add patience to your faith now if you have the right kind of faith you'll have the right kind of patience because Faith worketh patience or patience work with faith I have the scripture here right but what is that patience with as a patience with God amen it's not just human patience where some people they can just wait all the day long they're patient others not so much you know and we should be patient with one another right if your attitude is right you can be patient with God you can be patient with one another amen right amen Amen to that right patience as well a patience with God where God will answer in his time right just because time goes on it doesn't weaken our faith it doesn't make us say well I asked for healing last night nothing's I'm sick this morning oh my it's wrong no that's not that's not patience hey Nancy God told Abraham to wait 25 years it was 25 year weight but got Abraham had patience with God and he got Isaac amen Noah had patience real Godly patients 120 years building the ark all those things he had real Godly patience he was in the ARK for seven days before the rain fell you know imagine all the critics saying oh you know the lions are going to eat you you're you know they're probably all dead in there all the you said it's gonna rain it's still sunny Noah but he had real patience because that patience was based upon a revelation it wasn't based on a nice idea it was on Revelation Abraham could wait 25 years because it was Revelation that said you're going to have the promise son so it should be the same thing with you and I when the Revelation drops in our hearts that our children are coming home we can have patience with God and we can Rejoice because we know they're coming home right if we're sick but God puts a piece in our hearts all it's going to be fine then we can have patience but however he answers he's going to answer amen right but but if we don't have that kind of patience when timeling is on we get all upset we get annoyed at God and that just crumbles the whole building down yeah amen we've got to have real Godly patience amen see God tries your patience that's right God tries your patience he wants to see what you're made of praise the Lord amen so it was a genuine faith in our head it was a real Revelation and It produced a genuine patience that God would fulfill his word amen as this isn't James one my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience amen so if your faith is tried your Revelation has tried it works patience amen so if you but but let patients have a perfect work that you may be perfect in entire wanting nothing so you will have nothing lacking that's what that word wanting means amen and then we should have patience with one another yeah right well it's all about attitude right if you've got the attitude of God then you'll be patient with one another because sometimes we think man why don't these people get it they've been here this long blah blah blah but you forget God was long-suffering with you you know God spent years on your job on your case and then eventually said here I am God and he starts building and molding and all those things and God was way more patient with you but yet we get impatient with one another well I called that person why haven't they answered my WhatsApp don't know why haven't they done this patience they don't like me anymore no have patience but you know people get so caught up in things but you gotta have the right kind of patience praise the Lord amen now see you know if you have see if you have the wrong kind of patience or faith or virtue all these things then when trouble strikes then then reasoning comes in and then see people are going to think well maybe there's no God maybe this is all a mistake maybe this is a cult maybe this is wrong see because I have the wrong kind of maybe there is no God See it'll break the whole thing in two see that's why we've got to we've got to have the right kind of virtue knowledge patience temperance amen but then now now we come up to Godliness after patience so once that's all vulcanized by the Holy Ghost into you then you've got to have the right kind of godliness now godliness is not Material wealth you know the scriptures of First Timothy 6 perverse disputings of men and cropped of minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness he says from such withdraw thyself so some people think if you're really spiritual you have a lot of cars you have lots of homes you'll just be bling everywhere and you'll be wealthy right but that's not actually true yeah that is not godliness godliness to be means to be like God to be like Jesus amen now in order to be like him we've got to be perfect as you said in Matthew 5 and 48 be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is uh is perfect so I'm going to wrap this up real quick I know time's gone now if if God demands Perfection then he has to produce something that will produce the Perfection and that's why he gave us a perfect lamb a perfect sacrifice a perfect blood a perfect word that we can become perfect right so he doesn't he never demands anything Upon A people without first giving them the ability to do it so when he said be there for perfect even as your father in Heaven is imperfect that's because he was the perfect lamb that was going to make a perfect people buy a perfect blood amen so a perfect sacrifice makes a perfect people amen now the right attitude of godliness is to be like Jesus and he says I always do that which pleases the father yes sir see that's godliness to have that attitude I always do that which pleases the father so if you begin to tear people down does that please the father if you have selfish motives and objectives does that please the father if you put your own self what you want above others is that pleasing the father amen if you tear someone down do something wrong or no one will see this well actually God sees everything yes right yeah but does that please the father see we want to have a life Lord I want to live a life that pleases you you paid it all on Calvary but I want to live a life to manifest what you've done for me amen amen and it says in first Timothy 3 16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit scene of angels preaching to the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into Glory so godliness was manifested in the flesh which was our which is Jesus Christ Our Lord so the only real way to have godliness is that the Lord himself comes in hey man it's not trying to it's not trying to be well I have my skirt to the floor and my sleeves are this long and I've got a collar up here and you know oh praise the Lord carry around a message book and a Bible and you know you know and yeah looking down our noses at one another that's not godliness that's phariseeel pharisaical whatever he said it's just being a Pharisee just being an actor that's not godliness but if if Godless is when the Lord himself comes in the word is manifested in you right the wood puts on flesh in here amen amen you have that same kind of attitude I always do that which pleases the father wouldn't that be a great kind of testimony to have I remember it takes us full surrender for that to happen Hallelujah now after that after we have that then we have brotherly love I'm gonna I'm gonna be done real soon brother love is when you can put yourself in his place on the matter that's Brotherly Love yeah that's not oh you're so great no this is awesome no it's more than that you got to put yourself in his shoes in his place on the matter can you give someone the benefit of the doubt can you actually look Beyond and actually see what's going on you know that's actually we've got to be able to put ourselves in their shoes why are they talking that way why are they thinking that way why are they believing that way can you do that it's more than a mental gymnastics to do it but actually taxi but it's attitude because the attitude should be Lord I want them to be closer to you after we've had this conversation we've had this time together maybe we've had lunch maybe we're in church maybe we're playing a game I want them to draw virtue out of my life which is your virtue and I want to have the right attitude towards them that they're closer to you then when they first came yeah I mean shouldn't that be isn't that the kind of brother we need that see see it's not just a kindness because while they're good to me so I'll be good to them that's no no that's just getting along but that's not brotherly kindness you try and God can't vulcanize That Into You by his holy spirit amen see Peter said well my yeah my brother sinned against me how many times a day shall I forgive him seven times no Seventy Times Seven if you have brotherly kindness in your life you can do it yeah all right man Bradley kindness now you see if if a Brother's All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see no be kind to him anyhow see somebody said to me not longer how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God Oneness and all the rest then putsy brotherly kind of see hoping someday be patient with him see temper and enduring with some knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself to go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in see that's how it should be here hallelujah and then once all those virtues are in you then the Capstone of divine love comes down the Holy Ghost himself as he put these virtues he comes and seals you into the kingdom and then you are the living Tabernacle or the living Temple of the living God's Dwelling Place amen and to ask the question how long does it take to build well how long does it take for you to surrender all your Ambitions the things we hold on to so petty little things you know how how long does it take you to give all that up say Lord not my will but thy will be done that's how long it takes for God to build the building it doesn't have to take years sometimes it does take years but it doesn't have to take years it's how long are you willing to you know just give it all why are we saying all these things what about the Giants you want to take Giants down you're gonna be built in His image you've got to be have that Holy Spirit within you amen with those virtues see we don't want to just build up in what we think is you know because many people they'll you know come become a Believer then they'll start absorbing quotes and scriptures and they'll change how they dress maybe they think well I've really made it I'm a new person no that's just someone trying to build themselves into this image we can't do that friends we let the Lord put it in US amen because without that we're going to fall short and I pray with all my heart that we uh we don't do that that we should be able to see in our lives those things living out of us it's not us trying to put it on it's not like we've written it on our mirror in the morning we're brushing our head doing our teeth okay I've got to have this I need virtue I need knowledge no no it's not that you see it in your life is that your attitude towards others has changed because those virtues are in you yes yes right so let's have the musicians this morning I'm just gonna I'm just gonna cut it cut it there thank you amen I mean let's let's stand shall we um at least can you come sing that song for us again let's all sing it together yes I know you've got a cold honey but you want to come

life forever not just a sanctification but he comes and dwells in you yeah I mean changes your whole nature your whole being sort of you don't cut off your family don't run away stomp off and just grumpy and you know not talking to you no more that's not brotherly kindness that's not love amen you don't have that kind of attitude amen you love the Lord amen let's um I've got the words hey man
