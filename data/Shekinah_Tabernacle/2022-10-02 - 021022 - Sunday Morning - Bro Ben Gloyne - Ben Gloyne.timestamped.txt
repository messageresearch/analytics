[6:46] good to see your happy face bro
[6:50] it's a problem to come to the Living God
[6:54] this morning
[6:56] we serve a living God we don't serve a
[6:59] God that's like some rock or stone or
[7:02] idea
[7:04] but he's a living God he's Eternal and
[7:07] all of his sons and all of his daughters
[7:10] are living
[7:11] he said I'm the god of the living not
[7:13] the dead
[7:14] even if we might have appeared like we
[7:17] have passed and we've left this realm
[7:19] we're still alive all of his children
[7:21] are still alive they never die amen
[7:23] we're an eternal we're Eternal beings
[7:25] let's um stand this morning and invite
[7:28] the Living God to come amongst us this
[7:31] morning and when a living God comes
[7:33] things happen powerful things happen
[7:34] when our living almighty God comes into
[7:37] our into our presence and I believe
[7:38] that's what we are going to experience
[7:40] this morning the Living God is going to
[7:43] come here we're not going we haven't
[7:44] come here in vain
[7:45] we haven't come here just to sing a few
[7:47] songs and maybe hear a few thoughts
[7:49] but we've come here to meet the Living
[7:51] God and the Lord said we are two or
[7:53] three together in my name there am I
[7:55] there I am in the midst we're going to
[7:58] have a powerful time in the Lord this
[7:59] morning so let's let's approach the Lord
[8:01] by faith this morning Heavenly Father

[48:41] knowledge of God and of our and of Jesus
[48:44] Christ Our Lord according as his divine
[48:46] power hath given unto us all things that
[48:49] pertain unto life and godliness through
[48:51] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[48:53] to glory and virtue whereby given unto
[48:56] him was exceeding great and precious
[48:57] promises that by these you might be
[49:00] partakers of the divine nature having

[49:21] and abound they make you they make you
[49:24] that you shall be neither Barren nor
[49:26] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[49:28] Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these
[49:30] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[49:32] and has forgotten that he was purged
[49:35] from his old sins amen just want to
[49:38] leave the reading there but you know I
[49:39] want to speak about the Giants in the
[49:41] land yeah no we're right here of the of
[49:44] the you know your own Chronicles that
[49:46] there was there wasn't just Goliath that
[49:48] had to be down but there were other
[49:49] Giants there were sons of the Giants you
[49:51] know Goliath had a brother and but it
[49:53] was the Next Generation that slew these
[49:55] Giants now brother Baron would would
[49:57] relate to us that the last service that
[49:59] he preached at Bradham Tabernacle before
[50:01] he went on his great Evangelistic
[50:03] campaigns we know he did travel a bit
[50:04] before this but you know he preached
[50:06] about about David and Goliath and how he
[50:09] had a slingshot of faith and he was
[50:11] going to down this down this giant that
[50:14] was walking in the land that told the
[50:16] people that the days of Miracles has
[50:18] passed and and that's what his heart
[50:20] desire was that that people would see
[50:22] that Jesus Christ is alive that is not
[50:24] just an idea he's not just something to
[50:26] argue about he's not just a list of
[50:28] doctrines not just a church you go to
[50:29] but he's a true and living God that his
[50:31] promises are alive that his word is true
[50:33] and so he he went out there and he says
[50:35] because if there's one giant as soon as
[50:37] we can slay him the rest will take
[50:38] courage and the Lord granted that and
[50:40] there has been an old Roberts and the
[50:42] Jaggers and so forth pull the sword and
[50:44] we fought the enemy out of the land and
[50:45] shut their mouths they can't say
[50:47] Miracles don't happen because here they
[50:49] are sure God's word is eternal at flash
[50:52] on the urum sets the word flashed on the
[50:54] word that says you're my thunder and
[50:55] when it flashed on that it was positive
[50:58] and to anybody that's needy if you're a
[51:00] sinner you know uh you want to know how
[51:02] to get saved believe on the Lord Jesus
[51:04] Christ he said this in 1957 so that was
[51:07] as hard as desire when he went out there
[51:08] is that this is this giant of giant of
[51:11] you know you know unbelief that the days
[51:13] of Miracles have passed that those were
[51:14] just for the apostles and the Holy Ghost
[51:16] is not the same anymore and yo yo it was
[51:18] just for the apostles just for the book
[51:20] of Acts and we live in a different era
[51:21] and God doesn't do those same kind of
[51:23] things he went out there and slew that
[51:25] giant and then people begin to Rally
[51:27] because even even um you know historians
[51:29] who are not Pentecostal they're not even
[51:31] in the message they attribute the
[51:33] post-world War II healing Revival to
[51:35] brother Brown's Ministry he spearheaded
[51:36] it so he went out there he slew that
[51:38] giant even um you know people like Tommy
[51:41] Osborne all that um you know you know he
[51:43] was in that meeting there in Oregon with
[51:45] that big giant demon-possessed man came
[51:46] out to the platform said I'll tear you
[51:48] learn from lemon you know he saw he yo
[51:50] he saw that man full of brother Brown's
[51:52] feet after brother Bram said because
[51:53] you've challenged the spirit of the
[51:54] Living God you're going to fall at my
[51:55] faith and you know the police packed
[51:57] them out and all those things he saw
[51:59] those things and then he said in his own
[52:01] Testament he and his wife went and read
[52:02] the Bible again like they never read it
[52:04] before and they saw that God is alive
[52:05] and miracles do happen and then that
[52:07] sparked his ministry so many saw these
[52:10] Giants fall and they took courage they
[52:12] drew the sword amen but there are other
[52:14] Giants in the land that want to stop you
[52:16] actually obtaining your inheritance
[52:18] because as as as it wasn't just Goliath
[52:21] he's been slain we know he's alive we
[52:23] know the Lord Jesus Christ is alive we
[52:25] know he still does Miracles amen amen we
[52:27] know he's a miracle working God we
[52:29] understand that we've experienced it
[52:31] it's not just Theory it's not even just
[52:33] on tape anymore but that same Miracle
[52:35] working God has performed Miracles at
[52:37] our own midst amen so we know he is
[52:39] alive but there are these other Giants
[52:42] that want to stop us possessing every
[52:45] promise now when I'm talking about
[52:46] promises today I'm going to talk about
[52:48] the Statue of the perfect man because
[52:50] how you know the enemy does not want us
[52:53] to possess all these virtues he does not
[52:55] want us to be built as brother by Max he
[52:57] said when he preach that sermon he
[52:59] actually called it the building the
[53:01] living house the living God's dwelling
[53:02] place so you're building the Temple of
[53:05] the Living God that's what he really
[53:06] called it and you know so so the devil
[53:08] doesn't want to be want us to be built
[53:10] in that in that fashion and so you know
[53:13] you think of Goliath you know if you
[53:16] think of his brothers and his sons you
[53:17] know there are family traits that are in
[53:19] families right I know you know that's
[53:21] nothing shocking to anyone but you see
[53:23] family traits you see mannerisms you see
[53:25] characteristics you see you know you'd
[53:27] see traits that are in grandparents are
[53:28] now in the grandchildren and you know
[53:30] you can see how they how people act even
[53:32] mannerisms and and facial expressions
[53:34] and and so we could look at now how
[53:36] Goliath but you know acted would be the
[53:38] same way his sons and his brother would
[53:40] have acted now goliath we know he came
[53:42] out with fear and intimidation to hold
[53:44] Israel in a stalemate that was his whole
[53:47] plan for 40 days remember he came out
[53:48] said bring me a man you know let's not
[53:50] all fight just choose your Champion I'm
[53:52] the champion of my side let's fight
[53:54] whoever wins you know the loser will
[53:56] serve them that was that was his whole
[53:58] thing and for 40 days he just held them
[53:59] in a stalemate I don't know why they
[54:01] just didn't attack but yeah for 48s came
[54:03] out bring me a man right bring me man
[54:05] and and that's how the enemy works if he
[54:07] can hold you in a spot yeah then it just
[54:10] weakens Faith amen but you've got to see
[54:12] that you've actually got got the
[54:14] equipment you've got the weapon I mean
[54:16] to down every giant I mean brother Brown
[54:18] says you just start testifying singing
[54:20] doing something you'll you'll slag the
[54:21] lies you'll be cutting Philistines Plum
[54:23] to the walls your family will rally but
[54:25] you see if it gets you stuck in a
[54:27] quagmire right that's where that's where
[54:29] the enemy can trap you you know of Doubt
[54:31] is it is it really real can it really
[54:33] happen you know time goes on and you
[54:35] know but but we're going to look Beyond
[54:37] those things and look at the promise of
[54:39] God and so Goliath you know that's how
[54:41] we operated through fear and
[54:43] intimidation and held them in a
[54:44] stalemate but you see now and then and
[54:47] then and then even these Giants they're
[54:49] very interesting names now so this one
[54:51] uh supplies that's s-i-p-p-a-i this is
[54:55] um that we read about the original yo so
[54:57] the root meaning of of his name means a
[55:00] um uh the original senses of of
[55:02] containing
[55:03] of like a vestibule or a limit so it's
[55:06] like a dish that holds blood or wine but
[55:08] it's also so it's a bowl or a door or a
[55:11] gate or a threshold so so as even his
[55:14] name it it speaks of containing and
[55:17] what's he containing he's just
[55:18] containing Israel from possessing their
[55:20] promises that's what the devil wants to
[55:21] do so even his name is saying I'm going
[55:23] to contain you in your position you're
[55:25] not going to advance any further than
[55:27] where you are I mean you may have just
[55:29] repented been baptized you're gonna stay
[55:31] right there that's what it's going to
[55:33] try and contain amen then there's not
[55:34] gonna be any joy in your life no no
[55:36] peace No Love No reality of the Holy
[55:38] Ghost you just can't try and hold you
[55:40] there or that all you got with that
[55:41] brother or sister is going to hold you
[55:43] right there and that's all you can see
[55:44] is that thing that you can't seem to
[55:46] reconcile or make right or but if you
[55:48] just give it all to the Lord he'll take
[55:49] care of it all but he wants to try and
[55:51] contain you where you are and then even
[55:54] even this next giant this is uh
[55:57] l-a-hmi however you pronounced that the
[56:00] root word of his name actually means to
[56:01] feed on
[56:03] to to figuratively to consume uh by
[56:06] implication to battle such as
[56:08] destruction or devour to overcome or
[56:10] Prevail so so there's one that contains
[56:13] and then the other one just wants to
[56:15] consume you
[56:16] and this is what these Giants want to do
[56:18] these Giants of unbelief and you know
[56:20] Superstition and fear and you know and
[56:22] it's really reasoning that will hold us
[56:24] back true that is reasoning see the
[56:27] enemy will try and contain every
[56:29] Believer by reasoning see the battle is
[56:31] in the mind
[56:32] and that reasoning will always sound so
[56:35] right but it's actually so wrong you
[56:37] know if you could take your own
[56:38] reasoning and actually you know because
[56:39] many times in every situation if we're
[56:42] involved in it we can't look at it
[56:43] clearly like we could because we're
[56:45] emotionally involved but if you can
[56:46] actually take yourself out of the same
[56:47] scenario you'd give a different outcome
[56:50] you take the same scenario apply to
[56:53] someone I say why don't they just do
[56:54] that but you're in the same suit I'll
[56:56] never do that why because you're in it
[56:58] but you need to but that's reasoning see
[57:01] that's why we need to cast down our
[57:03] reasoning as the scripture says amen and
[57:05] we need to we need to get a hold of let
[57:08] the law get a hold of us
[57:10] that's what we've got to do all about
[57:12] being not just our mind but our soul and
[57:15] our spirit everything that we are
[57:17] our time our tongues
[57:20] our ambition you know you become your
[57:22] ambition
[57:23] so what do you want to be Brother David
[57:25] Silas said it years ago the Auckland
[57:27] convention one of me said you are your
[57:29] ambition you take someone who wants to
[57:31] win the 100 meter gold at the Olympics
[57:33] they become that ambition and now
[57:36] everything they do they become that they
[57:37] embody what they want to become and it's
[57:40] the same thing with you and I you will
[57:41] embody what you want to become true amen
[57:44] so if you want to become all that the
[57:46] Lord has for you you'll become it it's
[57:48] because you're fully Serenity after the
[57:50] word and then he can work right but if
[57:52] you just want to float along and looking
[57:53] for a place to get off you'll find a
[57:55] place to get off
[57:56] all right so reasoning so so such a
[57:59] these Giants try and hold people back
[58:00] especially when a church has been here
[58:03] for a while we get used to coming to
[58:04] church and having a message kind of
[58:06] culture you know getting you know we
[58:08] just kind of begin to fit into a mold
[58:10] but there's no life of the of the Lord
[58:12] in it but we you know we want to go
[58:13] beyond that
[58:14] right so so the reasoning a big
[58:16] reasoning is you know you're okay you've
[58:18] got a church that's fine that's all you
[58:20] need to do it's more than that you know
[58:22] it's just like if you stand in a garage
[58:24] long enough you'll never become a car
[58:27] you can even become a car just by
[58:28] standing in a garage you know you've got
[58:30] to have someone actually build you over
[58:31] to become a car it's like coming to
[58:33] church you don't just come to church and
[58:35] that that doesn't mean you're a
[58:36] Christian that doesn't mean you're going
[58:37] to heaven you've got to meet the one who
[58:38] gave the word meet the one who created
[58:40] all things and he'll make you a new
[58:42] creature
[58:43] amen so just saying you're okay but no
[58:45] we're gonna go beyond just being okay
[58:47] you know we can't just live off the
[58:49] atmosphere of coming to church
[58:51] you know we come here we get energized
[58:53] and strengthened and renewed and we
[58:55] should because we're in the presence of
[58:56] God but that same atmosphere should be
[58:58] in our hearts and should be in our lives
[58:59] wherever we go right sure more powerful
[59:02] I believe when we come together right
[59:04] because you bring your liquor fire I
[59:06] bring my liquor fire and God you're the
[59:07] Hope fullness of God comes into the
[59:09] place and it's just a big bonfire of the
[59:11] Holy Ghost burns out all the devils in
[59:12] trouble that same holy spirit is still
[59:14] in you if he's in you right so you can
[59:16] still have incredible
[59:18] um times in the presence of God by
[59:19] yourself when we come together I believe
[59:21] it's more powerful that's why Camp is
[59:23] always a phenomenal time right but
[59:25] that's the same God of campus right here
[59:26] this morning amen so you know but we
[59:29] can't just live off the atmosphere of
[59:30] the Holy Ghost and go back into our old
[59:32] lives right now that same atmosphere
[59:34] should be with you so yeah we can't just
[59:37] yes you've got to let him come into you
[59:38] now the baptism the Holy Ghost the giant
[59:41] will say it's just a thought
[59:42] that's just a way of thinking no it's
[59:44] not a way of thinking
[59:46] he's not just a thought just like the
[59:48] devil's not just a thought they're both
[59:49] beings yeah they have an agenda you know
[59:51] the devil's gender is to destroy you and
[59:53] marry you up and you give you
[59:55] spiritual Amnesia amen fill you of
[59:57] unbelief but God's God's ambition is he
[1:00:00] wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:01] use you for his glory then pack you into
[1:00:04] Glory one day that's what he wants to do
[1:00:06] so we can't just say well the Holy Ghost
[1:00:07] is a thought he's not just a thought
[1:00:09] amen amen when Jesus Promised or
[1:00:11] actually he says in second Corinthians 6
[1:00:13] he says and what agreement hath the
[1:00:15] temple of God with Idols for ye are the
[1:00:17] Temple of the Living God as God has said
[1:00:19] I'll dwell in them and walk with them
[1:00:21] and I'll be their God and they shall be
[1:00:23] my people that's why we've got to cast
[1:00:24] down our Idols amen our Idols of Pride
[1:00:27] Idols of of mistrust our Idols of pain
[1:00:31] whatever it is where to cast down those
[1:00:32] Idols amen because they will try and
[1:00:34] hold us back and they will oh yeah we've
[1:00:36] got to cast those things down you know
[1:00:38] what is the point of living in a desert
[1:00:40] when you can just cross a hill and live
[1:00:42] in the paradise it's the same thing when
[1:00:44] people without God they just live in a
[1:00:46] desert yes you know and I think this is
[1:00:48] all to life no there's more to it than
[1:00:49] this you know the person right next you
[1:00:51] could be living in the Oasis drinking
[1:00:53] from the fountain continually and you
[1:00:55] can say well there's nothing to this no
[1:00:56] you but you want to give up your pride
[1:00:57] and things and let God take you in
[1:01:00] he says I will never leave uh he says in
[1:01:03] John 14 I will not leave you comfortless
[1:01:05] I will come to you that's a person
[1:01:07] coming yeah just like if I call you up
[1:01:09] I'm going to come over right now I think
[1:01:10] so I arrive yeah it might take me a
[1:01:13] while gonna drive whatever but
[1:01:14] eventually I come there right it's not
[1:01:16] just yes my thoughts are with you and
[1:01:17] you know no I physically come right and
[1:01:20] the Lord Jesus he physically saw Spirit
[1:01:22] his Spirit comes into you yes amen amen
[1:01:25] he says I'll not leave you a couple of
[1:01:26] so it's not even it's not even a good
[1:01:28] thought
[1:01:29] he is not he is a person yes
[1:01:32] amen you know Giants will say well no
[1:01:34] one actually changes oh yes they do oh
[1:01:37] yes they do oh yes amen people are
[1:01:39] literally Changed by the baptism of the
[1:01:41] Holy Ghost he changes their nature he
[1:01:43] changes their Outlook he changes their
[1:01:45] attitude how many changes their men not
[1:01:47] just for a little bit and it's not a
[1:01:48] learned behavior but it's actually a new
[1:01:50] life comes in amen so it's not just no
[1:01:53] no you're so God's but a giant will say
[1:01:55] no one can actually change no they
[1:01:57] actually change
[1:01:58] I mean see when you're born of your
[1:02:01] natural parents you begin the natural
[1:02:02] life that came from them the same same
[1:02:04] kind of attitude characteristics
[1:02:06] mannerisms all those things same
[1:02:08] temperament and character but when
[1:02:09] you're born from above you live a life
[1:02:12] of your heavenly parent which is God
[1:02:14] himself and his nature and his
[1:02:16] characterist temperament that is the
[1:02:17] word comes into you and lives out
[1:02:18] Hallelujah
[1:02:20] amen because we know that we're not just
[1:02:22] a patched up job this is not a
[1:02:24] Reformation this is a transformation
[1:02:26] amen amen where it says in second
[1:02:28] Corinthians 5 and 17 therefore If any
[1:02:30] man be in Christ he is a new creature
[1:02:32] amen all things have passed away behold
[1:02:35] all things are become new so it's not
[1:02:37] just a patch up job but it's a but it's
[1:02:39] a transforming it's a new life comes
[1:02:42] into you you're a new creation yeah amen
[1:02:44] that's right a giant will say you well
[1:02:46] you're on a journey you'll get there
[1:02:48] eventually well why not just get to your
[1:02:50] destination the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:52] Ghost we're all on a journey no you know
[1:02:54] in the Old Testament there are six
[1:02:56] Sinners of Refuge yeah right and and if
[1:02:59] someone committed a crime you know then
[1:03:01] maybe manslaughter something happened by
[1:03:03] accident they could run to that City
[1:03:04] once they got into that City they were
[1:03:06] safe yeah right then it was brought
[1:03:08] before the judges all those things but
[1:03:10] when they're on their Journey
[1:03:12] how do you think would have been you
[1:03:13] know we're sitting by the roadside
[1:03:15] someone's running for their lives oh how
[1:03:16] are you doing you know I'm running for
[1:03:18] my life I enjoy the journey he says I'm
[1:03:21] not enjoying the journey
[1:03:22] this is the Avenger of blood right
[1:03:24] behind me he can get me you only enjoy
[1:03:27] the journey when you're home if that
[1:03:28] makes sense you know so don't just oh
[1:03:30] we're all on our journey no just give
[1:03:32] over to the Lord and you'll get into
[1:03:33] that place of safety which is Christ
[1:03:35] himself
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:37] they say oh well you know you received
[1:03:40] the Holy Ghost when you believe nothing
[1:03:41] really happens you know we receive it
[1:03:43] without sensation and no that's a giant
[1:03:45] right takes away the reality of actually
[1:03:47] receiving the Holy Ghost because brother
[1:03:49] Graham says that that sure you know we
[1:03:51] can receive it without sensation but
[1:03:53] then the works of Christ will live out
[1:03:54] of that life this is a definite change
[1:03:56] in life when he comes in Hallelujah
[1:04:00] amen oh well you just received the Holy
[1:04:03] Ghost when you're baptized in water not
[1:04:04] necessarily
[1:04:05] it's a definite experience that we must
[1:04:07] experience
[1:04:09] praise the Lord
[1:04:10] amen amen you know the Giants will say
[1:04:13] you don't really need to surrender your
[1:04:15] will over and your feelings are more
[1:04:16] important than the word
[1:04:18] yeah because no one you know I was
[1:04:20] reading this article the other day and
[1:04:22] it was actually about speaking to
[1:04:23] Children about you know because
[1:04:24] pornography is Rife in these days
[1:04:26] and and this article said you know
[1:04:28] you're going to be careful when talking
[1:04:30] to your um to your children about these
[1:04:32] things because you don't want to make
[1:04:33] them feel bad
[1:04:36] you know don't try and make them feel
[1:04:37] bad sure if they're trapped into it your
[1:04:39] spirit gets on people and they just
[1:04:41] become addicted to it but you know but
[1:04:42] there's this big thing today don't hurt
[1:04:44] someone's feelings no if you're wrong
[1:04:45] you're wrong
[1:04:47] you know and and if God convicts you
[1:04:49] will feel bad yeah and you're like but
[1:04:51] the reason he does it is because he
[1:04:53] wants to set you free but you can walk
[1:04:54] with him right but if there's no remorse
[1:04:56] if there's no regret how can you be free
[1:04:58] of something
[1:04:59] you know even some of the um some of the
[1:05:01] Nazis that were executed the Nuremberg
[1:05:03] trials they had no regret
[1:05:05] they had no remorse they didn't think
[1:05:07] they did anything wrong
[1:05:09] you know and sure that you that may be
[1:05:11] an extreme case but we don't want to
[1:05:13] ever get to a place where we never feel
[1:05:14] bad by our actions and things affect
[1:05:17] other people
[1:05:18] right so we don't want to be you know so
[1:05:21] so numb to those things no if if the law
[1:05:24] corrects us we will feel bad
[1:05:27] right praise the Lord ah but aren't you
[1:05:29] glad for those times
[1:05:31] thank you amen see see yo yo those
[1:05:34] giants will say no yo the word is not
[1:05:36] important
[1:05:38] Giants will say God doesn't look at how
[1:05:40] we dress doesn't matter if we wear pants
[1:05:41] or shorts or you know he looks at your
[1:05:43] heart but the outward reflects the
[1:05:45] inward yeah you know Legion was full of
[1:05:48] a thousand demons he was naked among the
[1:05:50] tombs
[1:05:52] so you know the word says it's not right
[1:05:54] because he doesn't like it we want to
[1:05:55] live a life that pleases Our God right
[1:05:58] not to try and gain anything but out of
[1:06:00] appreciation of what he's done for us
[1:06:01] yeah amen hey man hey man you're
[1:06:04] entitled to hold unforgiveness in your
[1:06:06] heart this is what Giants will say yes
[1:06:07] he wants to contain you anything that
[1:06:10] will contain you so you're entitled to
[1:06:12] them you know what they did to you
[1:06:15] you're you're totally the victim and you
[1:06:17] may be totally the victim but if you
[1:06:20] hold on to it it'll just contain you
[1:06:22] you'll never be free you'll never you'll
[1:06:23] be stuck and it will consume you amen
[1:06:25] but we're going to down these Giants
[1:06:27] amen I mean we're here to kill some
[1:06:29] Giants amen this morning I mean because
[1:06:32] we got a rally and take the whole land
[1:06:34] take every promise I mean so we
[1:06:37] shouldn't hold on you know Jesus You Can
[1:06:38] Think Jesus had every right to hold what
[1:06:41] his own people did against him he came
[1:06:44] to his own his own received enough he
[1:06:45] died of a broken heart on Calvary but
[1:06:48] yet as one of his last words or things
[1:06:50] he said was father forgive him they
[1:06:51] don't know what they do yeah so you know
[1:06:54] If he if he surrendered that you know to
[1:06:57] hold that against people he gave it over
[1:06:58] he he actually forgave them can't we
[1:07:01] forgive okay
[1:07:05] sir thank you you know another giant
[1:07:07] will say well people should feel sorry
[1:07:08] for you for what happened in your past
[1:07:11] that'll hold you yeah yeah we don't live
[1:07:13] we're not defined by our past we're
[1:07:16] defined by our future right and the Lord
[1:07:18] Jesus Christ is our future the Rapture
[1:07:20] is our future amen looking unto Jesus
[1:07:22] the author and finisher of our faith all
[1:07:24] right amen so we shouldn't ever let our
[1:07:26] past hold us back that will consume us
[1:07:28] right you say well you know I live with
[1:07:30] a lot of regret give the regret to God
[1:07:32] Amen you know forgetting the things in
[1:07:34] the past the Apostle Paul would say I've
[1:07:36] done so much wrong put it under the
[1:07:38] blood let him deal with it
[1:07:40] amen yeah John will say it's all just
[1:07:43] emotion
[1:07:44] when people shout and scream and dancing
[1:07:46] you know get anointed by God no it's not
[1:07:49] it's not just all emotions no say it's
[1:07:51] nothing to it well you know maybe
[1:07:52] because you've never experienced it
[1:07:53] that's why you say there's nothing to it
[1:07:55] amen but when you've realized that he
[1:07:57] set you free that you're on death row
[1:07:59] and he liberated you and he opened that
[1:08:01] prison door and he said come follow me
[1:08:02] and you walked out in this that's right
[1:08:04] and there's just pardon written across
[1:08:05] your book of life how can you not get
[1:08:07] emotional and
[1:08:09] you really think you're on your way to
[1:08:11] destruction I mean you're on your way to
[1:08:13] hell but yet he came but then Jesus came
[1:08:15] when you knock when you could not go to
[1:08:18] where he was he came to you doesn't that
[1:08:20] make you emotional hey man when you
[1:08:23] think about how he purchase your
[1:08:24] salvation he bled on Calvary amen
[1:08:27] redeemed you open his word to you in
[1:08:29] this end time doesn't it not make you
[1:08:30] emotional
[1:08:31] amen that we are free people that is
[1:08:34] lucious from Every Chain of the devil
[1:08:36] amen amen that should make us give a bit
[1:08:37] of emotion amen shouldn't it yes it
[1:08:40] should
[1:08:40] amen another John will say well people
[1:08:42] can't get the Holy Ghost like they did
[1:08:44] in the book of Acts that's a lie amen we
[1:08:47] serve the same God he has not changed
[1:08:49] one iota amen he still frees the same he
[1:08:52] baptizes the Holy Ghost the same he does
[1:08:54] everything exactly the same as word as
[1:08:56] is just as true and as powerful as it
[1:08:58] was when it was written it hasn't
[1:09:00] changed amen this is not just a club we
[1:09:02] joined this is not well you know I had
[1:09:04] people years ago tell me well you know
[1:09:06] God did miracles in the past but he
[1:09:07] doesn't need to do it anymore because
[1:09:08] he's proved himself and that was you
[1:09:10] know what a life he's got a PR he proves
[1:09:12] himself to every generation amen he
[1:09:15] liberates the same he casts our Devils
[1:09:17] the same he heals the same I mean
[1:09:18] transforms a life the same that they
[1:09:20] live according to the word that they'll
[1:09:22] dress away that's pleasing to God Amen
[1:09:24] they'll do all those things why because
[1:09:26] the Holy Ghost comes and he is still the
[1:09:29] same God Amen and the people in the book
[1:09:32] of Acts are the persecuted they kept
[1:09:34] walking on with God I mean they did not
[1:09:36] let those things drag them down but they
[1:09:38] brought them to the Lord that's why it's
[1:09:40] so important to have a holy ghost prayer
[1:09:41] meeting yeah
[1:09:42] and he tries to derail you in some way
[1:09:45] with pain or hurt or you know you feel
[1:09:47] so discouraged just gone to his presence
[1:09:49] amen the anointing comes down and breaks
[1:09:51] that yoke amen because that's what he
[1:09:53] does that's our God and he does that
[1:09:55] because he loves us he doesn't want to
[1:09:57] see the devil the devil seek God the
[1:09:59] devil gets nothing over God Amen
[1:10:01] amen you think about okay so we're in
[1:10:04] the upper room before the day of
[1:10:05] Pentecost they're a bunch of cowards
[1:10:07] heading away lock doors
[1:10:10] okay but then God says I'm going to
[1:10:12] begin to prove myself to these people
[1:10:14] yeah and then he fills them with the
[1:10:15] Holy Ghost do you think that wouldn't
[1:10:17] work do you think they would have would
[1:10:18] have wanted to go back as a coward now
[1:10:21] they're filled with the now now they
[1:10:22] know their sins are washed away they're
[1:10:24] the life and the lamb has come unto them
[1:10:27] and then and then the Sanhedrin comes
[1:10:29] against them and then they just say well
[1:10:30] should we serve God or man then they go
[1:10:32] and have a prayer meeting and God fills
[1:10:34] them again and gives them overcoming
[1:10:36] power against what the devil just put
[1:10:38] upon them and then so as they're walking
[1:10:40] with God God proves himself in their
[1:10:42] walk
[1:10:43] yes Hallelujah Peter's in prison he gets
[1:10:45] LED out of prison you know yes all those
[1:10:47] things happen and then even James got
[1:10:49] beheaded but the people still rejoiced
[1:10:51] in their Lord because God had used him
[1:10:53] and he was done
[1:10:55] right there's nothing can take our lives
[1:10:57] till God's finish with us upon the Earth
[1:10:59] but the thing is God allows us to go
[1:11:01] through trials and struggles because he
[1:11:02] wants to show himself in those things
[1:11:04] but when when the devil tries to put
[1:11:06] that upon us we're going to give it to
[1:11:07] God
[1:11:08] saying Lord this is what the enemy is
[1:11:10] trying to do in my life he wants to
[1:11:11] destroy me but Thou Art God why do the
[1:11:14] Heathen raging of Imagine a vain thing
[1:11:15] you know and then he comes down and
[1:11:17] fills us and gives us a you know a
[1:11:19] renewal a re-baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:21] gives us strength to keep facing the
[1:11:24] enemy
[1:11:25] Amen to the devil you know if the devil
[1:11:27] really had a couple of brain cells he
[1:11:30] would leave all of God's children alone
[1:11:32] because all he is doing is actually
[1:11:34] actually Allowing God to come and
[1:11:37] minister to them and pour himself in and
[1:11:39] to prove him and to show himself but you
[1:11:42] know the devil's got no clue he thinks
[1:11:45] he can destroy a child of God he cannot
[1:11:46] you say well I'm going through Grievous
[1:11:48] you know trials at the moment but the
[1:11:51] Lord knows what we can bear we may not
[1:11:53] know what we can bear but he knows what
[1:11:54] we can bear amen but always look for
[1:11:56] that way of Escape in every Troll and
[1:11:58] that way of Escape is the Lord right
[1:12:00] don't keep it all because remember
[1:12:02] when they were brought before the
[1:12:03] Sanhedrin and were threatened Don't
[1:12:04] Preach anymore in his name that was
[1:12:06] intimidation trying to hold the apostles
[1:12:08] that was a giant there of intimidation
[1:12:10] but then they went and had a prayer
[1:12:12] meeting so they looked for their way of
[1:12:14] escaping that Troll and that wave Escape
[1:12:16] is always the Lord Jesus so they went to
[1:12:18] him in prayer and the Lord broke that
[1:12:20] fair intimidation off their lives filled
[1:12:22] them with the boldness and they just
[1:12:23] continued on preaching and that would
[1:12:25] have even made them stronger than they
[1:12:27] were before that trial right because
[1:12:29] they realized hey the devil tries to do
[1:12:31] these things to us but our God is
[1:12:32] greater and our God gave us more
[1:12:34] strength than we even realized we had
[1:12:35] before
[1:12:37] praise God praise the Lord amen so he
[1:12:40] still does everything the same amen
[1:12:43] people say well Jesus just takes you as
[1:12:45] you are and you don't need to change he
[1:12:46] does take you as you are yeah but he
[1:12:48] doesn't leave you the same way everyone
[1:12:50] you read through the gospels everyone
[1:12:51] who came into the prince of God they
[1:12:53] didn't stay that same way
[1:12:55] that's right amen Legion didn't stay the
[1:12:56] same way the woman at the well didn't
[1:12:58] say the same way the woman caught an
[1:13:00] adultery didn't stay the same way Peter
[1:13:01] James and John didn't stay the same way
[1:13:03] amen they are all changed amen and yeah
[1:13:07] people say well you don't need to change
[1:13:08] well actually it's the law that changes
[1:13:10] you if you're willing to be changed amen
[1:13:11] yeah amen you know pride is such a giant
[1:13:16] this is such a prideful age
[1:13:19] yes I'm not I'm not just talking about
[1:13:21] different flags now I'm talking about
[1:13:22] Pride
[1:13:23] in general you know we should be able to
[1:13:26] be corrected no matter who we are
[1:13:29] right if and it doesn't matter how
[1:13:31] gifted we are
[1:13:33] if we are if we cannot be correct that
[1:13:35] it shows we do not have the right
[1:13:37] Spirits yes right and we shouldn't even
[1:13:39] be there in the first place
[1:13:41] I mean not to pick on the band but
[1:13:42] there's a lot of people in the band but
[1:13:44] you know you know if but but anyone here
[1:13:46] if if we can't take advice and guidance
[1:13:50] then we shouldn't be in that position
[1:13:52] right it's the same thing you know even
[1:13:54] in a work situation your manager comes
[1:13:57] and talks to you about something
[1:13:58] you know you say no you just bet him
[1:14:00] there's going to be problems
[1:14:02] he said hold on but he but he actually
[1:14:04] wants to come or she wants to come and
[1:14:05] say look we need to work through this
[1:14:07] you know and if you can say okay right
[1:14:10] let's walk through it you know let's
[1:14:11] work through this let's look for a
[1:14:12] solution let's make this better then
[1:14:14] you'll continue on but but if people put
[1:14:16] Roblox up well there's trouble
[1:14:19] so we want to really look at now when we
[1:14:23] look at the Statue of the perfect man
[1:14:25] actually I'm going to read this so
[1:14:26] brother bam says it's a marriage and
[1:14:28] divorce he says now job and those
[1:14:30] characters with David so David's Mighty
[1:14:32] Men that's through the Giants see with
[1:14:33] David a little old fellow but they seen
[1:14:36] the man was um
[1:14:37] um they seen that God was in him and
[1:14:39] David they know he is coming into Power
[1:14:41] someday one slew them other five
[1:14:43] brothers of glass into um a single hand
[1:14:45] of one kill 300 men when some women were
[1:14:48] picking beans for dinner the Army had
[1:14:49] gone away he took a spare and killed 300
[1:14:51] men Philistines seek character why they
[1:14:54] stayed right by David they know the
[1:14:56] anointing was upon him and they knowed
[1:14:57] he was coming into Power a pure picture
[1:15:00] of the church today that will stand by
[1:15:01] the word we know it's going to be made
[1:15:03] Vindicated we know it's coming into
[1:15:05] Power someday he was a fugitive from the
[1:15:08] rest of the nation but they know it he
[1:15:10] was coming into power we know he's
[1:15:11] coming into power too so we'll take that
[1:15:14] word and stand right there no matter
[1:15:15] what it costs if we have to cut
[1:15:17] Philistines jump in a pit killer and as
[1:15:20] when did we go anyhow because that's the
[1:15:22] way God designed it to be amen we look
[1:15:25] for character and this is what God's
[1:15:27] looking for in this day character amen
[1:15:29] amen not not just human character that
[1:15:32] we're born with but god-given character
[1:15:34] and this is so important because if you
[1:15:37] really look at the Statue of the perfect
[1:15:38] man which we're going to go briefly
[1:15:39] through now is that it's all about
[1:15:41] attitude
[1:15:43] attitude is so important
[1:15:46] right so so Brother Bear even says that
[1:15:48] you know he you know he's praying he
[1:15:50] says God take away all Folly make a
[1:15:53] sincere knowing we must answer at the
[1:15:55] Judgment of God someday and our attitude
[1:15:58] towards him and his word now will
[1:16:00] determine our Eternal destination so
[1:16:02] it's our attitude not what we know about
[1:16:05] our attitude means everything yeah amen
[1:16:08] so if we have the right because if we
[1:16:10] have the right attitude towards the Lord
[1:16:11] Jesus then we have the right attitude
[1:16:12] towards one another am I just like if we
[1:16:15] love him we'll love one another right
[1:16:16] amen so it's always that way so now it's
[1:16:19] so important when we look into this now
[1:16:21] because God says we're going to be built
[1:16:23] into this image
[1:16:25] now I want to make this clarifier in the
[1:16:27] beginning where brother Ram says in a
[1:16:29] guide so this is this isn't the message
[1:16:30] after we preach the statue of the
[1:16:31] perfect man he says now don't forget now
[1:16:33] as always this that there that these are
[1:16:36] the things that build the servant of
[1:16:37] Christ see Faith first and virtue now
[1:16:39] remember the Holy Spirit cannot cap the
[1:16:42] building of god Till these things are
[1:16:43] operating by the spirit no matter what
[1:16:46] you are see those are the things that
[1:16:47] build the body of Christ see those
[1:16:49] things now don't forget that that this
[1:16:51] here is first is your faith virtue
[1:16:53] knowledge so forth to be added to it
[1:16:55] until the complete statue of Christ is
[1:16:57] made manifest and the Holy Spirit comes
[1:16:59] upon it and seals it as one body these
[1:17:02] things must be therefore Jesus said by
[1:17:04] their fruits they are know and see fruit
[1:17:06] you cannot bear fruit without these
[1:17:08] things to Bear it in you and then when
[1:17:10] you when all this takes place all the
[1:17:12] worldliness and ungodlin and so forth
[1:17:13] and then all the unbelief is cast out
[1:17:15] then all the things of the world has
[1:17:17] passed away than this nothing but a new
[1:17:19] creature in Christ and and then
[1:17:20] Ephesians 4 30 is grieved not the holy
[1:17:22] spirit of God whereby we're seal to the
[1:17:24] day of your Redemption sealed into the
[1:17:26] kingdom of God now don't forget that
[1:17:28] keep that in mind now take these things
[1:17:30] first and the ceiling is the Holy Spirit
[1:17:32] the cap that seals us into the body all
[1:17:35] right so so if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:17:37] you have these virtues in you
[1:17:39] see you don't get bought tits see
[1:17:41] brother bam and that sermon he says you
[1:17:43] gotta you become born again then you get
[1:17:45] Faith and you build up now that birth is
[1:17:46] a sanctification birth
[1:17:48] because you don't receive the Holy Ghost
[1:17:50] twice right you don't receive the Holy
[1:17:52] Ghost and you build into the image of
[1:17:53] the perfect man then you receive it
[1:17:54] again right you receive it once yeah but
[1:17:58] you see people coming and and and and
[1:18:00] and we have to let God build us how he
[1:18:02] wants to build us right we cannot see we
[1:18:06] cannot just come along and just you know
[1:18:08] absorb some quotes and some scriptures
[1:18:10] but our Nature has not changed see and
[1:18:12] this is why it's so important that
[1:18:14] because if we really are kept with the
[1:18:15] Holy Ghost we can down every Giant
[1:18:18] amen right and if there's a longing in
[1:18:19] our heart amen that these Giants are not
[1:18:22] going to hold us back no more Pride's
[1:18:23] not going to hold us back pain
[1:18:25] misunderstanding discouragement you know
[1:18:28] Superstition whatever it may be yeah you
[1:18:30] know those things feelings are not going
[1:18:32] to hold us back no more these things
[1:18:33] will not contain us but we're gonna get
[1:18:35] every promise that's in the Bible for us
[1:18:37] now don't fall asleep on me just now if
[1:18:39] we need to stand up we'll stand up don't
[1:18:40] do a headstand you'll do a handstand
[1:18:42] whatever you know but listen this is
[1:18:43] very important because the devil just
[1:18:45] wants the lowest to sleep and just think
[1:18:47] well just because you say God's in a
[1:18:49] prophet you go I'm gonna Rapture that's
[1:18:50] got nothing to do with it maybe you're
[1:18:52] going to become one with the living word
[1:18:53] amen one with the scripture that when
[1:18:55] people see you they see a living Bible
[1:18:57] and word and indeed it's so important
[1:18:59] it's not just well I'm a Christian
[1:19:00] they're lost and I'm better than them
[1:19:01] that's the wrong attitude no but people
[1:19:04] should see a living Bible and if they
[1:19:05] they should be able to see these virtues
[1:19:07] manifested amen now Faith this is the
[1:19:10] foundation we know that that faith is
[1:19:12] the faith in the word see people can
[1:19:13] have their faith in the wrong thing you
[1:19:15] know they could have their faith in a
[1:19:17] man that's why so many people be
[1:19:18] disappointed because they've made
[1:19:20] brother Branham God but he's not God
[1:19:22] he's just a prophet right the only
[1:19:24] person who's never failed in life is our
[1:19:26] Lord Jesus Christ God himself he's the
[1:19:28] unfailing one but people get so absorbed
[1:19:30] in the character of the prophet and they
[1:19:32] you know then they get disappointed in
[1:19:33] the man then they leave but it's because
[1:19:35] they're worshiping the wrong person
[1:19:36] though they say they're worshiping Jesus
[1:19:38] they're actually worshiping William
[1:19:40] Branham so they're worshiping the wrong
[1:19:42] man but we worship the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:43] here amen where the Bible that has
[1:19:45] preeminence right amen and everything
[1:19:48] brother man preached we can find it in
[1:19:49] the scripture that's why it's so
[1:19:50] important you hear a message find it in
[1:19:52] the scripture yes amen amen yeah I I
[1:19:54] promise you you'll find it when he
[1:19:56] preaches major Doctrine it'll be in the
[1:19:57] scripture amen so now faith is the
[1:20:01] foundation that faith has got to be
[1:20:03] faith in the word
[1:20:05] amen and it's a real it's a real
[1:20:08] born-again Faith it's not just a human
[1:20:10] faith
[1:20:11] and it produces our faith is the
[1:20:13] foundation amen amen now
[1:20:17] because we're going to realize that we
[1:20:19] can come up to the altar we can say Lord
[1:20:21] forgive me and have a great experience
[1:20:23] of sanctification where the Lord
[1:20:24] cleanses out a person and those and we
[1:20:27] have a great time shouting screaming
[1:20:29] running around and all those things are
[1:20:31] important and you can have those
[1:20:32] experiences all the way through your
[1:20:33] walk right we don't just have a well it
[1:20:35] used to be kind of a walk with God no
[1:20:37] he's The Great I Am he's the same
[1:20:39] yesterday today and forever and he still
[1:20:41] does those things for us now right we
[1:20:42] should stay in our first love Amy we
[1:20:45] should stay where God can speak to us
[1:20:46] and and change our hearts and mold us
[1:20:48] and Matt so if we feel like shouting we
[1:20:51] can shout right man this is not a
[1:20:52] lecture theater I've sat in too many
[1:20:54] lecture theaters in my day I didn't know
[1:20:56] when to quit University I should have
[1:20:57] got out a lot earlier than I did but you
[1:20:59] see I've sat in a lot of dead lectures
[1:21:01] and even a lot of dead religious
[1:21:02] lectures you know but it's got to be
[1:21:04] more than that but the spirit of God's
[1:21:06] going to come and anoint that word to
[1:21:07] our hearts amen and make it live sir a
[1:21:10] real faith that the word is right and
[1:21:12] that's why the devil doesn't want people
[1:21:14] to have that Foundation well how do you
[1:21:17] not try it's written over 2 000 years
[1:21:19] ago it's been translated so many times
[1:21:21] look at this and this and look at what
[1:21:24] text you uses the base and how do you
[1:21:25] know they translated it right and no
[1:21:27] it's all it's all unbelief that the
[1:21:30] devil does not want us to have faith in
[1:21:32] this word now if you think about it do
[1:21:35] you believe God corrects your life when
[1:21:37] you're wrong
[1:21:38] they're really correct no if he keeps
[1:21:41] his hand upon you don't you think he
[1:21:43] could keep his hand upon his own work
[1:21:44] don't you think that he would actually
[1:21:46] because remember he has obligated to
[1:21:49] every man woman and child upon the
[1:21:50] planet that if they really have a hunger
[1:21:53] and a genuine desire is there really a
[1:21:55] god then he is obligated to leave
[1:21:58] something upon the Earth that people can
[1:22:00] come to and meet him through and
[1:22:02] remember we don't worship God through a
[1:22:04] church that's the that's the fallacy of
[1:22:06] denomination they think they're
[1:22:07] worshiping God because they go to a
[1:22:09] church though we worship God through the
[1:22:10] word
[1:22:11] because he is his word amen right so so
[1:22:14] you think of God if God corrects you and
[1:22:16] I when we put our foot wrong
[1:22:18] right don't you think he'll keep his
[1:22:19] hand upon his word to give us the truth
[1:22:21] of the scripture amen amen amen but
[1:22:24] that's a giant that holds people back
[1:22:26] you know they jump on the internet look
[1:22:27] at all these archaeologists all these
[1:22:29] things they claim Moses wasn't real and
[1:22:31] this is written here it's not even
[1:22:33] written at that time all this nonsense
[1:22:34] you know but we know the word is true
[1:22:37] because what the word promises it
[1:22:39] manifests amen right when we look at the
[1:22:41] word it says if you repent in a baptize
[1:22:44] baptized name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:22:46] remission of sin you shall receive the
[1:22:47] gift of the Holy Ghost who's received
[1:22:49] the Holy Ghost who's come that way maybe
[1:22:51] he got baptized in titles but then when
[1:22:53] you really got baptized the right way
[1:22:55] then God began to work like never before
[1:22:57] see that is the word proving that it is
[1:23:00] that it is right
[1:23:02] amen yes amen truly so we we're going to
[1:23:05] realize that just coming up having a
[1:23:07] great sanctification experience that's
[1:23:09] only you've just laid the foundation
[1:23:11] we don't just want to stay there
[1:23:13] amen but we're building a house yep but
[1:23:17] it's the faith in the word of God that's
[1:23:19] the foundation of Christianity hey man
[1:23:22] that's our foundation then we begin to
[1:23:24] grow
[1:23:26] amen
[1:23:27] see by the see but it's all about
[1:23:29] attitude because it says that um Amos
[1:23:31] three and three how can two walked here
[1:23:33] on this they'd be agreed so if you if
[1:23:35] you can't agree with the word then how
[1:23:37] can you walk with the word see that's
[1:23:39] why we've got to agree with the word
[1:23:41] and then we walk with the Lord by that
[1:23:43] way yeah right so if the word is
[1:23:45] contrary to
[1:23:46] what we think and how we feel how we've
[1:23:48] been raised we're to lay that aside and
[1:23:50] walk with the word
[1:23:51] amen amen amen
[1:23:53] amen amen I used to wear stabbings
[1:23:56] yeah quite a lot but then the Lord
[1:23:58] convicted me said you're naked off yeah
[1:24:01] here came long pants that's it and I'm
[1:24:03] happy in the tropics if I'm in the here
[1:24:05] where it's freezing wherever you know
[1:24:06] that doesn't bother but but because the
[1:24:08] word says it's not it's not modest right
[1:24:10] it's actually nakedness if you look into
[1:24:11] the scripture if you're a Bible reader
[1:24:13] you'll know that right so so it wasn't
[1:24:15] well my culture says no I look like an
[1:24:18] oddball no praise the Lord Robert's
[1:24:20] pleasing to God here we go
[1:24:22] you know so no but then now you've got
[1:24:24] to add to your faith virtue it's good if
[1:24:26] we believe the word is true right amen
[1:24:29] that he's taking that Stony heart out of
[1:24:30] us so he's given us a heart of Flesh to
[1:24:32] actually say yes the word is right but
[1:24:34] then we've got to add to our faith
[1:24:35] virtue now I just want to preface this
[1:24:37] right now this is not humanly adding
[1:24:39] something
[1:24:40] so this is not well I have to act a
[1:24:42] certain way therefore I'm going to
[1:24:43] change my behavior my own strength to
[1:24:45] change you know it's this is not how
[1:24:47] this works this is God adding it
[1:24:49] remember we are God's construction site
[1:24:51] right we are like a building a well into
[1:24:54] the scaffolds there's you know God is
[1:24:56] building and working and things that's
[1:24:57] how we are yes we're not our own
[1:24:59] workmanship we are his workmanship right
[1:25:01] and that's the big problem with religion
[1:25:03] is man has tried to be their own
[1:25:04] workmanship yeah let me fix you no no
[1:25:07] let God that's why it's so important to
[1:25:09] pray yes let him do it amen amen praise
[1:25:13] God
[1:25:14] so we're going to add virtue now now
[1:25:16] that virtue brother Brown says doesn't
[1:25:18] just meaning living like a virtuous life
[1:25:20] like a holy life but that virtue is
[1:25:23] actually strength you know when he was
[1:25:25] going to drive his house to raise or to
[1:25:27] heal uh well heal first but then to
[1:25:30] raise uh dryas's daughter right there's
[1:25:32] the one with the blood as you came
[1:25:34] through the crowd touched him of His
[1:25:35] Garment and then he stopped and says who
[1:25:37] touched me because I perceived strength
[1:25:39] came out of me yeah and she was made
[1:25:41] whole by that strength now now we all
[1:25:44] have virtues here we've got to have if
[1:25:45] we can't if we don't have it we can't
[1:25:47] give it
[1:25:48] right you can't give what you don't have
[1:25:51] so so in order to give virtue because
[1:25:54] because where does God work through his
[1:25:55] people
[1:25:56] right the word comes into you then it
[1:25:59] lives out of you right we need god with
[1:26:01] skin on sometimes oh yes Hallelujah just
[1:26:04] like brother Brown tells the story of a
[1:26:06] kid in a storm there's lightning
[1:26:07] flashing oh sometimes without girls and
[1:26:08] things the wind's howling and you know
[1:26:10] storms whatever they come into our room
[1:26:12] we're scared see that see they want a
[1:26:14] bit of stability oh no everything's okay
[1:26:16] I'm Place snoring away cutting some
[1:26:18] hardwood on my side of the bed you know
[1:26:19] but you know we're there so it's okay BC
[1:26:22] it has to be we have to have a virtue or
[1:26:25] a strength that people can actually
[1:26:28] receive and be strengthened by
[1:26:32] hallelujah amen we're going to have we
[1:26:33] have that kind of virtue where someone
[1:26:35] looks at us as a Christian
[1:26:37] see and they see that actually they can
[1:26:40] draw from our lives it's not like we're
[1:26:42] we're you know if someone doesn't have
[1:26:44] any virtue that people try and draw
[1:26:46] strength from that life they don't get
[1:26:47] anything out of it like going to the
[1:26:49] bank and trying to withdraw money and
[1:26:51] insufficient funds see but if you have
[1:26:53] virtue in you I mean that someone can
[1:26:55] look at look upon you as a Christian and
[1:26:58] and and actually say this person lives a
[1:27:01] stable sane life
[1:27:03] see how can someone look at us and say
[1:27:05] oh they're a Christian but tomorrow
[1:27:06] they'll see us out in sin see there's
[1:27:09] not much virtue that you can draw out of
[1:27:10] an unstable life like that well where we
[1:27:13] can be singing shouting one day but the
[1:27:15] next day we you know people can see us
[1:27:16] do all kinds of things so you can't draw
[1:27:18] strength in that kind of a life see
[1:27:19] that's not the right kind of virtue
[1:27:21] there amen but if someone can look at
[1:27:23] you and they can see that virtue that
[1:27:26] that here's a person who's stable who's
[1:27:29] sane who's loving who's considerate who
[1:27:33] is who's loving the Lord week in week
[1:27:36] out
[1:27:37] praise a lot you can draw from that life
[1:27:39] where they go through a trial they may
[1:27:41] be heavy under the trial but they're
[1:27:43] still believing they're still walking
[1:27:44] with God they come out the other side
[1:27:46] they're rejoicing there they go through
[1:27:47] another hard thing and you can see that
[1:27:49] person say well if that person can do it
[1:27:51] by the Lord's Grace I believe I can go
[1:27:53] through it too I mean if that person can
[1:27:55] keep walking with God then I believe
[1:27:58] when trouble strikes me I can walk with
[1:28:00] god what is that person doing drawing
[1:28:02] virtue out of that life drawing strength
[1:28:04] because what is virtue virtue's strength
[1:28:07] that is power yeah amen so if we can be
[1:28:10] that way we're a you know be a sane
[1:28:12] sensible Christian who conducts
[1:28:14] themselves as a child of God where the
[1:28:16] things are going fine or not fine or
[1:28:18] through a trial or through a you know
[1:28:19] you go through a trial or a hardship
[1:28:21] then people can draw virtual strength
[1:28:23] out of our lives so I've got to have the
[1:28:25] right kind of virtue
[1:28:27] right you know we draw strength out of
[1:28:30] you know our lord Jesus here is a great
[1:28:32] he is the great Fountain of virtue and
[1:28:34] we read in the gospels how he overcame
[1:28:37] and he surrendered his life In The
[1:28:39] Garden of Gethsemane and all those
[1:28:40] things we draw strength oh yeah do you
[1:28:43] draw strength out of those kind of
[1:28:44] stories why because it's virtue in him
[1:28:46] that we can draw from
[1:28:48] so
[1:28:49] if it's the same way with him wouldn't
[1:28:51] it be the same way with us
[1:28:52] we're about it but you see it's attitude
[1:28:55] see if our attitude is right see if
[1:28:59] attitudes wrongly well praise God I
[1:29:01] don't care what people think about me
[1:29:03] it's their own problem you know I can do
[1:29:05] what I want to get you know they should
[1:29:08] not externalize responsibility you know
[1:29:10] all those kind of things no hold on we
[1:29:12] are responsible for one another my
[1:29:14] actions will affect you not just by
[1:29:17] standing here but in everyday life my
[1:29:18] actions will affect you that's right
[1:29:20] right but so so if our attitude is right
[1:29:23] to be Lord I want to live a life in such
[1:29:25] a way that my children can see actually
[1:29:27] what I what I believe is actually my
[1:29:29] life it's not just on Sunday where I put
[1:29:32] on a tie and I've got to put this shirt
[1:29:33] on and you know you know and put on some
[1:29:36] kind of church face stuff they should
[1:29:37] say I'm a Christian weekend week out and
[1:29:40] the good times and the bad time I pray
[1:29:41] they do I really do but you know but but
[1:29:43] that way they can draw strength yeah
[1:29:46] amen it should be the same thing with
[1:29:48] the honor remember we want to kill some
[1:29:49] Giants we need character right all right
[1:29:52] man now you've probably already got
[1:29:54] these things you can just Rejoice but
[1:29:55] you know but when you've got real faith
[1:29:57] that the word is right then add to it
[1:29:59] virtue
[1:30:00] right because some people they can be in
[1:30:02] drugs they say yeah the Bible's True
[1:30:03] Praise the Lord I believe it I believe
[1:30:05] from cover to cover the maps the
[1:30:07] concordance the whole thing
[1:30:09] but there in the world doing all kinds
[1:30:10] of things or maybe someone has got a
[1:30:12] temper to fight a buzzle you know you
[1:30:14] you just do something the wrong way they
[1:30:16] just roll up and but yeah they're
[1:30:18] professing to be Believers there's not
[1:30:19] virtue in that life yeah
[1:30:21] see we've got to have the right kind of
[1:30:23] virtue now I just want to say this right
[1:30:24] now too how long does it take me to grow
[1:30:26] into this statue well how long does it
[1:30:28] take you to die to yourself
[1:30:30] right because when God accepts a life
[1:30:33] then he seals it that's it so this is
[1:30:35] not a this is not a seven month program
[1:30:37] you know oh well we yeah you know
[1:30:40] Easter's in April so we're gonna have a
[1:30:42] whatever month program that we're gonna
[1:30:43] be ready no no no how long does it take
[1:30:45] you to actually surrender your whole
[1:30:46] being over
[1:30:48] that you're willing
[1:30:50] now knowledge so so once you've got that
[1:30:52] right kind of um virtue you've got to
[1:30:55] have the right kind of knowledge
[1:30:58] now we're going to have the knowledge to
[1:31:00] believe that God cannot lie see see
[1:31:03] there's worldly knowledge and then
[1:31:04] there's Supreme knowledge there's
[1:31:06] there's a knowledge of God
[1:31:08] so when it speaks of knowledge it
[1:31:09] doesn't mean now you should be able to
[1:31:11] recite every scripture
[1:31:14] or recite every message that's not the
[1:31:17] kind of knowledge no it's it's Godly
[1:31:19] knowledge right and that knowledge is is
[1:31:21] actually all about attitude as well
[1:31:24] see it's it's a knowledge that God
[1:31:26] cannot lie that his word is true don't
[1:31:29] fall asleep on me he his word is true
[1:31:32] and it is right and God what God said
[1:31:36] he's able to perform that's the right
[1:31:38] kind of knowledge see we should have the
[1:31:40] right kind of knowledge I'm going
[1:31:41] through a trial but he's going to get me
[1:31:42] out I'm in my family maybe going Wayward
[1:31:45] but he's going to bring them home amen
[1:31:47] he promised them to me they're gonna
[1:31:48] come I may be sick but I believe he's
[1:31:50] going to heal me I may have trouble in
[1:31:52] my life but God's gonna take care of the
[1:31:54] trouble right that's the kind of
[1:31:56] knowledge he'll never leave him nor
[1:31:57] forsake me right that's the right kind
[1:31:59] of knowledge you add to your virtue amen
[1:32:01] because if you've got the right kind of
[1:32:02] virtue that people can draw strength out
[1:32:04] of your life it's because you've got the
[1:32:06] right kind of knowledge all right that
[1:32:08] God's word is true amen and he's able to
[1:32:10] perform that which he has promised amen
[1:32:13] say it's knowledge to judge if the word
[1:32:15] is right or wrong
[1:32:17] right and and so our knowledge should be
[1:32:19] or our judgment should be the word is
[1:32:21] always right it's right it's always
[1:32:24] right so it's so so my feelings are
[1:32:26] wrong if they're contrary to the word
[1:32:27] that's right right my Outlook is wrong
[1:32:29] if it's contrary to the word you know so
[1:32:31] everything of its contrary to the word
[1:32:33] it's wrong
[1:32:35] if you have the right knowledge then you
[1:32:37] can add it to your virtue
[1:32:40] amen amen
[1:32:41] but but you know see it's all about
[1:32:43] attitude like I said about the Bible
[1:32:44] people say it's been mistranslated it's
[1:32:46] been wrong you know it's wrong and
[1:32:48] different things how can you know it's
[1:32:49] actually right that's the wrong
[1:32:51] knowledge that's right well I read this
[1:32:53] website the other day this person said
[1:32:54] this how do you know this person how do
[1:32:55] you know what kind of Life they have
[1:32:57] right you know and but yet there's a
[1:32:59] whole bunch of people here saying no the
[1:33:00] word is true we have Godly knowledge
[1:33:02] we've seen it live amen amen but if you
[1:33:06] try and add the wrong kind of knowledge
[1:33:08] to your virtue into your faith then it
[1:33:09] will make the building crumble
[1:33:11] see it's got to be Godly kind of
[1:33:13] knowledge not worlding I see see people
[1:33:15] have an attitude well you can only
[1:33:16] understand the Bible if you know all the
[1:33:18] historical and cultural contexts of that
[1:33:21] text before you can understand it
[1:33:23] correctly that's not how God works if
[1:33:25] you needed to understand those things
[1:33:26] that would have been in here
[1:33:29] right yeah
[1:33:31] no believe the word how it's written
[1:33:34] amen so it's the right kind of knowledge
[1:33:36] to have is that the word is always right
[1:33:38] and God is able to perform that which he
[1:33:40] has promised amen amen and then when you
[1:33:43] have all that see and and then his
[1:33:45] knowledge is also I have come to do thy
[1:33:47] will o God
[1:33:48] see it's not just your knowledge the
[1:33:50] Bible is right but then you have the
[1:33:52] knowledge now I've come to do your will
[1:33:53] so not my will but thy will be done amen
[1:33:57] see and so with that now with the
[1:33:59] father's word see Jesus said so so Jesus
[1:34:02] had Supreme knowledge right and his
[1:34:04] knowledge was I've come to do thy will o
[1:34:06] God and see what the father's word he
[1:34:08] defeated every devil heavens and earth
[1:34:10] will pass away but the word will not see
[1:34:12] when you've got that kind of knowledge
[1:34:13] he says then vulcanize it with your
[1:34:15] faith and your virtue now vulcanization
[1:34:18] is when you get two bits of rubber and
[1:34:20] then you have a sulfur um yo assault
[1:34:23] with an accelerator and then you heat it
[1:34:24] between 140 and 160 degrees and it
[1:34:27] actually melds them together so it's not
[1:34:30] like who's ever who's ever fixed a tire
[1:34:32] puncture yeah I did yeah good yeah yeah
[1:34:35] I've done a few but see all that is as a
[1:34:38] as a patch with some glue
[1:34:40] that's all it is so it doesn't vulcanize
[1:34:42] so there's actually so so there's the
[1:34:44] tube there's the patch and there's glue
[1:34:46] between it it's not it's not actually
[1:34:48] melded together by heat so that patch
[1:34:51] can be busted right there's actually a
[1:34:53] pressure can come or whatever and that
[1:34:55] and yeah and that puncture can blow
[1:34:57] again but if but if it's been vulcanized
[1:35:00] on there's actually no gap between the
[1:35:03] tube and the patch because the heat of
[1:35:04] God Now cover vulcanizes it together
[1:35:07] right because we have the right
[1:35:09] temperature I mean that's why it's so
[1:35:11] important to say Lord with the fire of
[1:35:13] your Holy Spirit add your virtue into my
[1:35:16] life I mean because that fire will burn
[1:35:18] out all the drops of what we think right
[1:35:20] and it'll vulcanize your faith The
[1:35:23] Virtue into your face it's like Lord
[1:35:25] that same heat while I'm in your oven oh
[1:35:27] God pouring now amen your knowledge burn
[1:35:31] out my thinking of what I think you are
[1:35:33] and change it into how you are that's
[1:35:36] why it's so important we can have such a
[1:35:38] bad
[1:35:39] misrepresentation of God by thinking God
[1:35:41] is like our natural father but he is not
[1:35:44] like our natural father one but there
[1:35:45] may be a but like our fathers were Godly
[1:35:48] but that's not his whole character of
[1:35:50] God well that's why he said Lord show me
[1:35:52] your character show me your nature see
[1:35:55] you get into the fire of God he'll
[1:35:57] vulcanize that knowledge where he's a
[1:35:59] loving father he's a god of stability
[1:36:01] he's a god of vision amen he's not just
[1:36:03] leaves you wandering along helpless amen
[1:36:05] but he's a God who protects he's a God
[1:36:08] who cares he's a God who understands
[1:36:11] amen surprise the Lord so we need that
[1:36:13] vulcanization see vulcanized it with
[1:36:16] your faith and your virtue let the holy
[1:36:18] spirit bond them together
[1:36:20] see you cannot advert your knowledge or
[1:36:22] any of these virtues by the glue of
[1:36:25] human ability you know people think well
[1:36:27] I've got to live a virtuous life well I
[1:36:29] better clean my life up myself
[1:36:31] you know out of but if it's just human
[1:36:34] ability
[1:36:35] it's not going to work
[1:36:37] but if it's a change in desire in your
[1:36:39] heart yes then those things will go
[1:36:42] hey man Hallelujah praise the Lord see
[1:36:46] patience
[1:36:47] people think well I need to be patient
[1:36:49] now because patience is one of the
[1:36:50] virtues so I need to try and learn
[1:36:52] patience or practice it it'll never work
[1:36:54] that's right you know it'll never work
[1:36:56] because there'll be a bit where you had
[1:36:57] a bump on the road and that and that
[1:36:59] patch will burst
[1:37:01] right it's the same with the knowledge
[1:37:03] of our Lord Jesus see it should be not
[1:37:05] my will but thy will be done I have come
[1:37:08] to do thy will o God
[1:37:10] I mean see some people they get angry at
[1:37:13] God when things go wrong they think God
[1:37:15] why is this happening this is wrong and
[1:37:17] see the reason is is because they have
[1:37:19] the wrong kind of knowledge
[1:37:22] see Jesus was was rejected he died of a
[1:37:25] broken heart he was misunderstood he had
[1:37:28] a bad name if there were websites
[1:37:30] written in those days oh boy
[1:37:32] the stuff that would have been written
[1:37:34] about hammering about John the Baptist
[1:37:35] all the apostles that would have been
[1:37:36] character assassination all the day long
[1:37:38] just like they do today
[1:37:41] but you see so but you see the thing is
[1:37:43] though he did not get angry
[1:37:46] because remember he was led right he
[1:37:49] says the sun could do nothing to the
[1:37:50] father shows him and what the father
[1:37:51] shows and the son does likewise so he
[1:37:54] knew that yo so when he went to Calvary
[1:37:56] he was led to Calvary right yeah but he
[1:37:59] never got angry
[1:38:01] at his father when things went wrong you
[1:38:04] know humanly it looked like it was going
[1:38:06] wrong why am I in this storm why am I
[1:38:08] hungry why I wouldn't have a place to
[1:38:09] lay my head all these things no he never
[1:38:12] he never got angry
[1:38:14] because he said his attitude was I've
[1:38:17] come to do thy Willow God because he had
[1:38:18] Supreme knowledge see the reason people
[1:38:20] get angry at God when they go through
[1:38:22] trials is because they don't have the
[1:38:24] right kind of knowledge they think of
[1:38:26] God as an errand boy now
[1:38:29] even most people got children here you
[1:38:31] say can you please go do this yes and
[1:38:34] they don't do it I can't you just you
[1:38:36] just don't understand you get a bit
[1:38:37] upset why didn't you go do it yeah
[1:38:39] now people apply that same kind of
[1:38:41] thinking to God but God I prayed for
[1:38:44] healing weren't they heal God I prayed
[1:38:46] for this and it still hasn't happened
[1:38:48] and people get angry why am I in this
[1:38:49] trial and this is this is basically God
[1:38:51] it's your fault that's the wrong kind of
[1:38:53] knowledge amen but you could always be
[1:38:55] always you know have always have the
[1:38:57] right attitude Lord you know what's best
[1:38:59] for me you know the path that I should
[1:39:01] take and you know that this is actually
[1:39:03] working for my goodness amen you know
[1:39:06] people can get annoyed at God because
[1:39:07] they pray and it's like things are going
[1:39:09] in the opposite direction down their
[1:39:11] prayers you know I pray for their
[1:39:13] salvation that's you know I've prayed
[1:39:15] this long and it's not happening it's
[1:39:16] not fair it's like basically like saying
[1:39:18] to one of the girls why have you done
[1:39:19] this yet I asked you to do it it's the
[1:39:21] wrong kind of knowledge
[1:39:24] hey man he's not an errand boy he's the
[1:39:27] Lord God Almighty and he's interested in
[1:39:29] your character being his character
[1:39:31] that's what he's interested in he'll
[1:39:32] Rapture people that manifest all that he
[1:39:35] is in his character
[1:39:37] amen see we should never see that's not
[1:39:40] a surrendered attitude
[1:39:42] see a surrendered heart is I have come
[1:39:45] to do thy will o God see isn't that a
[1:39:46] surrendered heart speaking Yeah amen
[1:39:49] when a surrendered heart prays the
[1:39:51] conclusion is always thank you Lord you
[1:39:53] know what's best for me I'm trusting you
[1:39:55] that's how we should be amen if you've
[1:39:57] got that kind of knowledge let the Holy
[1:39:59] Ghost vulcanize it to your virtue
[1:40:01] Hallelujah
[1:40:03] amen but then we come up the come up the
[1:40:06] pyramid or you know his brother van
[1:40:07] called it of temperance
[1:40:10] you got to add Temperance now Temperance
[1:40:12] is not just speaking about well you know
[1:40:14] abstaining from alcohol so I believe if
[1:40:17] you really got the Holy Ghost you you
[1:40:18] can't be a drunker because that's
[1:40:19] contrary to the word
[1:40:21] right you won't you know you'll be free
[1:40:23] of those things so so it's more than
[1:40:25] just that kind of temperance but it's
[1:40:27] actually a control of character
[1:40:29] see at Temperance to it see 10 see
[1:40:32] Temperance how to answer in kindness
[1:40:34] when wrath is spoke to you so start
[1:40:36] riling back you know they gave me this
[1:40:38] I'm going to give it back to them I'm
[1:40:40] gonna they're gonna learn a lesson
[1:40:42] that's all that kind of they said that
[1:40:44] against me I'll show them
[1:40:46] I'll tell everyone about it all these
[1:40:50] keyboard worries it's not even a pistol
[1:40:52] Jewel or a you know whatever anymore no
[1:40:55] it's people get it people sharpen their
[1:40:57] keyboards and they sharpen their
[1:40:58] smartphones and you know that's not
[1:41:00] temperance do you know what they said
[1:41:02] about me the other day
[1:41:05] that's not temperance
[1:41:08] it should be a soft answer always turns
[1:41:11] away Wrath
[1:41:12] that's what the scripture says
[1:41:15] amen see a real Temperance is to speak
[1:41:17] with a Godly love of kindness
[1:41:20] see is that the way you want to be when
[1:41:22] you rolled upon roll not back let him be
[1:41:24] your examples it's the right kind of
[1:41:25] attitude you know we can't see see
[1:41:28] Temperance has got to be the right so
[1:41:30] you've got to vulcanize the right kind
[1:41:31] of temperance
[1:41:33] see like
[1:41:35] like
[1:41:36] um you know when they say if they'll be
[1:41:38] the Son of God turn these stones into
[1:41:39] bread he could have done it and he and
[1:41:41] Jody was God but he had Temperance when
[1:41:43] they call them Beelzebub he said I
[1:41:45] forgive you for that's right they pulled
[1:41:47] handfuls of bed out of his face spitting
[1:41:50] his face come off the cross he said
[1:41:52] father forgive them they don't even know
[1:41:53] what they're doing when he had the gift
[1:41:55] he knowed all things for he was the
[1:41:57] fullness of God here bodily uh they had
[1:41:59] seen him before Miracles by telling
[1:42:01] people what was wrong with them and so
[1:42:02] forth like that they put a rag around
[1:42:04] his head uh like that around his eyes
[1:42:06] had him on the head with a stick
[1:42:07] prophesy tell us who hit you will
[1:42:09] believe you see he had Temperance now if
[1:42:11] you've got that added to your faith
[1:42:13] but if you still blow up and Sass and
[1:42:16] fasten stew and carry on you can't add
[1:42:18] that that will actually tear the whole
[1:42:20] building down
[1:42:21] see it won't vulcanize you can't take a
[1:42:24] piece of rubber you know and vulcanize
[1:42:26] it to a piece of iron it won't work see
[1:42:28] because the wrong kind of temperance is
[1:42:30] not the temperance of Jesus Christ
[1:42:31] himself that's the see his Temperance we
[1:42:33] need to add well I have every right to
[1:42:35] tell them what I think about them
[1:42:37] hold on what about turning the other
[1:42:39] cheek
[1:42:40] yeah amen yeah see we have the right
[1:42:43] kind of temperance see sometimes you
[1:42:44] think why don't we get further with God
[1:42:46] because there's Giants of reasoning
[1:42:47] holding us back see if we had the right
[1:42:50] kind of attitude then those things
[1:42:52] wouldn't hold us back from getting the
[1:42:53] right kind of temperance
[1:42:55] amen see so when you have when you have
[1:42:58] that kind of temperance turn the other
[1:43:00] cheek amen
[1:43:02] then add it to your file yeah
[1:43:05] price a little I know I'm going a bit
[1:43:06] methodically but we're just going on a
[1:43:08] walk today because we're going to have
[1:43:10] the right kind of character right there
[1:43:12] are giants that are holding us back not
[1:43:14] just as a church but as individuals and
[1:43:16] we want to down those giants we will not
[1:43:18] be contained I will not be contained by
[1:43:20] a Superstition unbelief whatever it may
[1:43:23] be I will not be contained the same God
[1:43:26] that fell in the book of Acts is the
[1:43:27] same God today and I believe he does the
[1:43:29] same kind of things today and we should
[1:43:31] not settle for anything less than what
[1:43:33] we read in the book of Acts amen I
[1:43:35] believe that amen amen so we want to
[1:43:37] have the right kind of want to be built
[1:43:38] the right kind of way because God is
[1:43:40] looking remember when God raptures a
[1:43:42] people he's not looking for just a he's
[1:43:44] not even just looking for a list of
[1:43:46] Miracles behind their name he's looking
[1:43:48] for his character and a People amen
[1:43:50] right but we need that same God to make
[1:43:53] us into this image amen but we don't
[1:43:56] just you know and I say we won't be
[1:43:58] containers because we're not here just
[1:43:59] to become formal and just to drift along
[1:44:02] women
[1:44:03] now once you've got that you've got to
[1:44:04] add patience to your faith now if you
[1:44:07] have the right kind of faith you'll have
[1:44:08] the right kind of patience because Faith
[1:44:10] worketh patience or patience work with
[1:44:13] faith I have the scripture here right
[1:44:15] but what is that patience with as a
[1:44:16] patience with God
[1:44:19] amen it's not just human patience where
[1:44:21] some people they can just wait all the
[1:44:22] day long they're patient others not so
[1:44:25] much you know and we should be patient
[1:44:27] with one another right if your attitude
[1:44:29] is right you can be patient with God you
[1:44:30] can be patient with one another amen
[1:44:32] right amen Amen to that right patience
[1:44:34] as well a patience with God where God
[1:44:37] will answer in his time right just
[1:44:39] because time goes on it doesn't weaken
[1:44:41] our faith it doesn't make us say well I
[1:44:43] asked for healing last night nothing's
[1:44:45] I'm sick this morning oh my it's wrong
[1:44:47] no that's not that's not patience hey
[1:44:50] Nancy God told Abraham to wait 25 years
[1:44:52] it was 25 year weight
[1:44:54] but got Abraham had patience with God
[1:44:57] and he got Isaac amen Noah had patience
[1:45:00] real Godly patients 120 years building
[1:45:02] the ark all those things he had real
[1:45:05] Godly patience he was in the ARK for
[1:45:07] seven days before the rain fell
[1:45:08] you know imagine all the critics saying
[1:45:10] oh you know the lions are going to eat
[1:45:11] you you're you know they're probably all
[1:45:12] dead in there all the you said it's
[1:45:14] gonna rain it's still sunny Noah but he
[1:45:17] had real patience because that patience
[1:45:19] was based upon a revelation it wasn't
[1:45:22] based on a nice idea it was on
[1:45:24] Revelation Abraham could wait 25 years
[1:45:26] because it was Revelation that said
[1:45:28] you're going to have the promise son so
[1:45:30] it should be the same thing with you and
[1:45:31] I when the Revelation drops in our
[1:45:33] hearts that our children are coming home
[1:45:35] we can have patience with God and we can
[1:45:37] Rejoice because we know they're coming
[1:45:39] home right if we're sick but God puts a
[1:45:41] piece in our hearts all it's going to be
[1:45:42] fine then we can have patience but
[1:45:44] however he answers he's going to answer
[1:45:46] amen right but but if we don't have that
[1:45:49] kind of patience when timeling is on we
[1:45:51] get all upset we get annoyed at God and
[1:45:53] that just crumbles the whole building
[1:45:54] down yeah amen we've got to have real
[1:45:57] Godly patience
[1:46:00] amen see God tries your patience that's
[1:46:03] right God tries your patience he wants
[1:46:05] to see what you're made of praise the
[1:46:07] Lord amen so it was a genuine faith in
[1:46:11] our head it was a real Revelation and It
[1:46:13] produced a genuine patience that God
[1:46:16] would fulfill his word amen as this
[1:46:19] isn't James one my brethren counted all
[1:46:21] joy when you fall into diverse
[1:46:22] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[1:46:24] of your faith worketh patience amen so
[1:46:27] if your faith is tried your Revelation
[1:46:29] has tried it works patience amen so if
[1:46:31] you but but let patients have a perfect
[1:46:33] work that you may be perfect in entire
[1:46:36] wanting nothing so you will have nothing
[1:46:39] lacking that's what that word wanting
[1:46:41] means amen and then we should have
[1:46:43] patience with one another yeah right
[1:46:45] well it's all about attitude right if
[1:46:46] you've got the attitude of God then
[1:46:48] you'll be patient with one another
[1:46:50] because sometimes we think man why don't
[1:46:52] these people get it they've been here
[1:46:53] this long blah blah blah but you forget
[1:46:55] God was long-suffering with you you know
[1:46:57] God spent years on your job on your case
[1:47:00] and then eventually said here I am God
[1:47:02] and he starts building and molding and
[1:47:04] all those things and God was way more
[1:47:06] patient with you but yet we get
[1:47:07] impatient with one another well I called
[1:47:09] that person why haven't they answered my
[1:47:10] WhatsApp don't know why haven't they
[1:47:11] done this patience
[1:47:14] they don't like me anymore no have
[1:47:16] patience
[1:47:17] but you know people get so caught up in
[1:47:20] things but you gotta have the right kind
[1:47:21] of patience
[1:47:23] praise the Lord
[1:47:26] amen now
[1:47:29] see
[1:47:31] you know if you have see if you have the
[1:47:34] wrong kind of patience or faith or
[1:47:36] virtue all these things then when
[1:47:38] trouble strikes then then reasoning
[1:47:41] comes in
[1:47:42] and then see people are going to think
[1:47:45] well maybe there's no God maybe this is
[1:47:47] all a mistake maybe this is a cult maybe
[1:47:49] this is wrong
[1:47:51] see because I have the wrong kind of
[1:47:52] maybe there is no God See it'll break
[1:47:54] the whole thing in two see that's why
[1:47:56] we've got to we've got to have the right
[1:47:58] kind of virtue knowledge patience
[1:48:01] temperance
[1:48:02] amen but then now now we come up to
[1:48:04] Godliness after patience so once that's
[1:48:07] all vulcanized by the Holy Ghost into
[1:48:09] you then you've got to have the right
[1:48:10] kind of godliness now godliness is not
[1:48:12] Material wealth
[1:48:14] you know the scriptures of First Timothy
[1:48:16] 6 perverse disputings of men and cropped
[1:48:18] of minds and destitute of the truth
[1:48:20] supposing that gain is godliness he says
[1:48:23] from such withdraw thyself so some
[1:48:25] people think if you're really spiritual
[1:48:27] you have a lot of cars you have lots of
[1:48:29] homes you'll just be bling everywhere
[1:48:31] and you'll be wealthy right but that's
[1:48:33] not actually true yeah that is not
[1:48:36] godliness godliness to be means to be
[1:48:38] like God to be like Jesus
[1:48:41] amen now in order to be like him we've
[1:48:43] got to be perfect
[1:48:45] as you said in Matthew 5 and 48 be
[1:48:47] therefore perfect even as your father
[1:48:49] which is in heaven is uh is perfect so
[1:48:51] I'm going to wrap this up real quick I
[1:48:53] know time's gone now if if God demands
[1:48:57] Perfection then he has to produce
[1:48:59] something that will produce the
[1:49:00] Perfection and that's why he gave us a
[1:49:03] perfect lamb a perfect sacrifice a
[1:49:06] perfect blood a perfect word that we can
[1:49:09] become perfect right so he doesn't he
[1:49:12] never demands anything Upon A people
[1:49:13] without first giving them the ability to
[1:49:15] do it so when he said be there for
[1:49:17] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:49:19] imperfect that's because he was the
[1:49:21] perfect lamb that was going to make a
[1:49:22] perfect people buy a perfect blood
[1:49:25] amen so a perfect sacrifice makes a
[1:49:28] perfect people
[1:49:30] amen now the right attitude of godliness
[1:49:33] is to be like Jesus and he says I always
[1:49:35] do that which pleases the father
[1:49:37] yes sir see that's godliness to have
[1:49:40] that attitude I always do that which
[1:49:42] pleases the father so if you begin to
[1:49:44] tear people down does that please the
[1:49:45] father if you have selfish motives and
[1:49:48] objectives does that please the father
[1:49:49] if you put your own self what you want
[1:49:52] above others is that pleasing the father
[1:49:53] amen if you tear someone down do
[1:49:56] something wrong or no one will see this
[1:49:58] well actually God sees everything yes
[1:49:59] right yeah but does that please the
[1:50:01] father see we want to have a life Lord I
[1:50:03] want to live a life that pleases you you
[1:50:05] paid it all on Calvary but I want to
[1:50:07] live a life to manifest what you've done
[1:50:09] for me amen
[1:50:11] amen and it says in first Timothy 3 16
[1:50:13] and without controversy great is the
[1:50:15] mystery of godliness God was manifested
[1:50:17] in the flesh justified in the spirit
[1:50:19] scene of angels preaching to the
[1:50:21] Gentiles believed on in the world
[1:50:22] received up into Glory so godliness was
[1:50:25] manifested in the flesh which was our
[1:50:27] which is Jesus Christ Our Lord so the
[1:50:29] only real way to have godliness is that
[1:50:31] the Lord himself comes in
[1:50:33] hey man it's not trying to it's not
[1:50:35] trying to be well I have my skirt to the
[1:50:37] floor and my sleeves are this long and
[1:50:39] I've got a collar up here and you know
[1:50:41] oh praise the Lord carry around a
[1:50:43] message book and a Bible and you know
[1:50:45] you know and yeah looking down our noses
[1:50:47] at one another that's not godliness
[1:50:49] that's phariseeel pharisaical whatever
[1:50:53] he said it's just being a Pharisee just
[1:50:54] being an actor that's not godliness
[1:50:57] but if if Godless is when the Lord
[1:51:00] himself comes in the word is manifested
[1:51:02] in you right the wood puts on flesh in
[1:51:05] here amen amen you have that same kind
[1:51:07] of attitude I always do that which
[1:51:09] pleases the father wouldn't that be a
[1:51:10] great kind of testimony to have I
[1:51:13] remember it takes us full surrender for
[1:51:14] that to happen
[1:51:16] Hallelujah now
[1:51:18] after that
[1:51:19] after we have that then we have
[1:51:21] brotherly love I'm gonna I'm gonna be
[1:51:22] done real soon brother love is when you
[1:51:25] can put yourself in his place on the
[1:51:27] matter
[1:51:28] that's Brotherly Love yeah that's not oh
[1:51:30] you're so great no this is awesome no
[1:51:32] it's more than that you got to put
[1:51:34] yourself in his shoes in his place on
[1:51:36] the matter can you give someone the
[1:51:38] benefit of the doubt can you actually
[1:51:40] look Beyond and actually see what's
[1:51:42] going on you know that's actually we've
[1:51:45] got to be able to put ourselves in their
[1:51:47] shoes why are they talking that way why
[1:51:49] are they thinking that way why are they
[1:51:50] believing that way
[1:51:52] can you do that
[1:51:53] it's more than a mental gymnastics to do
[1:51:56] it but actually taxi but it's attitude
[1:51:57] because the attitude should be Lord I
[1:52:00] want them to be closer to you
[1:52:02] after we've had this conversation we've
[1:52:04] had this time together maybe we've had
[1:52:05] lunch maybe we're in church maybe we're
[1:52:07] playing a game I want them to draw
[1:52:09] virtue out of my life which is your
[1:52:10] virtue and I want to have the right
[1:52:12] attitude towards them that they're
[1:52:13] closer to you
[1:52:15] then when they first came
[1:52:17] yeah I mean shouldn't that be isn't that
[1:52:19] the kind of brother we need that see see
[1:52:21] it's not just a kindness because while
[1:52:23] they're good to me so I'll be good to
[1:52:24] them that's no no that's just getting
[1:52:26] along but that's not brotherly kindness
[1:52:28] you try and God can't vulcanize That
[1:52:30] Into You by his holy spirit
[1:52:33] amen see Peter said well my yeah my
[1:52:36] brother sinned against me how many times
[1:52:38] a day shall I forgive him seven times no
[1:52:40] Seventy Times Seven
[1:52:42] if you have brotherly kindness in your
[1:52:44] life you can do it yeah
[1:52:46] all right man Bradley kindness now you
[1:52:48] see if if a Brother's All Out Of Tune
[1:52:49] don't be impatient with him see no be
[1:52:51] kind to him anyhow
[1:52:53] see somebody said to me not longer how
[1:52:55] can you believe these things the way you
[1:52:57] do and still go to the Assemblies of God
[1:52:58] Oneness and all the rest then putsy
[1:53:01] brotherly kind of see hoping someday be
[1:53:03] patient with him
[1:53:04] see temper and enduring with some
[1:53:06] knowledge to understand what he believes
[1:53:08] remember it's in his heart that's what
[1:53:10] it is virtue in yourself to go out with
[1:53:12] kindness meekness to him having faith
[1:53:14] that someday God will bring him in see
[1:53:17] that's how it should be
[1:53:19] here hallelujah and then once all those
[1:53:22] virtues are in you
[1:53:23] then the Capstone of divine love comes
[1:53:26] down the Holy Ghost himself as he put
[1:53:28] these virtues he comes and seals you
[1:53:30] into the kingdom and then you are the
[1:53:32] living
[1:53:33] Tabernacle or the living Temple of the
[1:53:35] living God's Dwelling Place
[1:53:37] amen and to ask the question how long
[1:53:40] does it take to build well how long does
[1:53:41] it take for you to surrender all your
[1:53:43] Ambitions the things we hold on to so
[1:53:45] petty little things you know how how
[1:53:48] long does it take you to give all that
[1:53:49] up
[1:53:50] say Lord not my will but thy will be
[1:53:52] done that's how long it takes for God to
[1:53:54] build the building
[1:53:55] it doesn't have to take years sometimes
[1:53:57] it does take years but it doesn't have
[1:53:59] to take years it's how long are you
