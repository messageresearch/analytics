and amen I know uh We've hosted some meetings there back home in different times and I know all the burden that goes into it and amen sometimes it can get a little discouraging and all the preparation and things happening but when you see the fruit of it and you see the Believers being blessed we gives us the grace to press on so we say God bless you all and to all the pastors and ministers I

as a p for a pastor to take a Sunday away from their congregations but we say God bless you brother Andrew brother Al different ones I know brother Freddy would be here if he was in the country but amen we're praying for him in their trip there and I I I just have to say I appreciate all the friends here amen the Lord has given us in the country of New Zealand amen uh about several years ago brother Freddy and the church there invited us down and had some meetings and met many of you all and and brother Al and brother Ben different ones amen it is an honor to be a part of the body of Christ with you all and tonight we just want to take a few moments in the word of the Lord if you have your Bibles we want to go to the Book of Romans the 8th chapter The Book of Romans the 8th chapter and just a few things here tonight on our heart we pray will be a blessing to you and Romans chapter 8 and verse number 11 it's a very very familiar scripture to the Eagles and the Believers of this end time word but here the Bible says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you then he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you maybe we just read that together Romans 8:11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your moral bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for a few moments from that passage of scripture if I would take a title tonight I want to talk to you on this we must not lose our enthusiasm we must not lose our enthusiasm I want to begin by saying that I believe the enthusiasm of an age is the message of that age in 1965 brother BR preaches two very powerful sermons and both of these sermons are centered around the subject of quickening power he will preach the sermon the Easter seal and then he will preach the sermon it is the rising of the sun now I'm in my fa and title from that sermon the Easter seal in paragraph 47 he said now as Christians we all claim he is alive or we've been quickened from Death To Life by his Spirit he said if we haven't been quickened then we've not been made alive he said now we're going to break into this subject the Lord willing kind of teach it for a few moments he said how that are we quickened and can we be sure that this is the truth he said now this is your own life this is my life and if this isn't the truth what I'm fixing to say then I'm one of the most foolish people in the world he says I've give my life for something there's nothing to and so have you but if it is the truth he said then I owe everything that I am I owe everything I could be to the cause of which we're standing for he says and I think that we mustn't lose our enthusiasm amen I think that we mustn't lose our enthusiasm you know I'll say this thank God a Vindicated Prophet that has come among the church who has not preached things from an unbalanced view amen but he has brought a balance to every subject in which he would present to the church now in 1950 believest thou this he said now I would rather have a little enthusiasm amen than no ASM at all amen amen just to have somebody get enthused about it brother BR makes a statement again 1958 he said the church today has lost its enthusiasm he said why because it has got out of the vine he said it's no more being energized by the spirit Wells of water bubbling up into everlasting life he said they've lost that Zeal something is missing he said but if God Remains the Same and Christ Remains the Same he said but his church has disassociated itself amen with his connection which is the vine or the spirit listen I believe that the holy spirit of God Amen is the s force of zeal and energy and enthusiasm amen that is in the Church of the Living God brother said now have you noticed today's crop have you noticed today what we do he said we got enough God about us to we come up on the platform and say yes maybe I better come up now this is the experience of it worldwide he said yes I better go up and stand and say well well I don't know here I am see huh what a place to be amen there's no fire burning there's no enthusiasm amen there's not a go into it now listen to The Prophet there's no fire burning there's no enthusiasm there is not a go into it amen and as an evangelist that just kills me to see God's people in that shape amen we are supposed to be on fire the brother B was saying that there is no Zeal or there is no fire or there is no burden or there is no passion Amen to go into it now you all know that brother brandom in 1961 had a vision amen and in the vision he was standing on the map of Palestine he says in that Paradox 61 he said in that Vision I was 2third of the way there he said and I looked across and there was the Jordan he said but on the other side of the Jordan he said there's where all the promises were laying I want you to think about something he had already come amen 2third of the way there it doesn't take a scientist to realize he had already come amen two pulls of a three-pool Ministry amen but notice the promises were not laying in the first pool they were not laying in the second pool amen but all the promises that belong to the bride amen was laying in the third pool so a prophet said see we've got to have an enthusiasm amen or a fire or a Zeal amen that will cause us to go into it brother said see people misunderstand this enthusiasm they misunderstand today he said they misunderstand the power of the Holy Spirit they just call it a bunch of Holy Rollers or a bunch of people amen that ain't got their right mind they misunderstand amen that you had to lose what you call your right mind amen because you can't have the mind of Christ in you and your right mind he said you can't have the mind of the world Amen and the mind of Christ at the same time amen one of them is carnal and the other is spiritual he that walks after the flesh is carnal but he that walks after the spiritual is spiritual amen so I will lose Lose Myself amen and find it Lord in thee he said so God is misunderstood now that's a very powerful statement amen that God is misunderstood he said it's not you that's misunderstood amen it's the Holy Spirit making you do that amen that they misunderstand amen they're not speaking against you amen they are speaking against him listen so when God comes upon you Amen to believe the word and by the word in your heart being quickened it brings a reaction to the word of faith amen and you just say Amen or hallelujah or however you respond to the word amen and people say well that's a Holy Roller or that's just an emotional person no they're not misunderstanding you amen they are misunderstanding the god that is on the inside of you that is causing you to respond to the word in the manner that you respond when I think of that word enthusiasm amen Webster says that enthus ASM is a strong excitement of feeling amen it is something that is inspiring it is a Zeal it is a fervor now I want you to hear this it is a belief in special Revelations of the Holy Spirit listen that didn't come from a message preacher that didn't come from a Bible commentary that is Webster's definition of the word enthusiasm is there would be a belief Amen in special Revelations that would be brought by the Holy Ghost now in John chapter 1 the Bible said that Jesus chose his disciples and he chose one by the name of Phillip brother said after Phillip got converted he was all enthused because in any man when he finds Jesus and gets saved amen there is an enthusiasm he said you got to be born again and when you're born there is an enthusiasm that rises amen with that birth it sets the soul of fire it takes all the difference es away and the isms and come straight to Calvary and recognizes Christ with the Burning Love and Zeal amen for the lost and Fallen World listen if you get a church birth you won't have any enthusiasm if you get a denominational birth you will not have any enthusiasm but if you get the birth of John the third chapter that would come by the water and the blood and the spirit then there will be an enthusiasm that will be birth from the dep of your soul and that enthusiasm will burn when you're on the mountain it will burn when you're in the valley it will burn when you're sick it will burn when you're well oh Church of the Living God I think it's time to come back Amen to the authority of the birth of the word of Jesus Christ listen and that birth tells me no matter where I am or what I'm going through I am still a Son of God sometimes I just like to tell the devil Amen on my good day days I'm a Son of God and on my bad days I'm a Son of God when I'm on the mountain I'm a Son of God and when I'm in the Valley I'm a Son of God when I feel God I'm a Son of God and when I don't feel God I'm a Son of God listen my condition does not dictate my seed it don't matter if I'm in the hospital I'm a Son of God if I'm broke I'm a Son of God Amen I am not a son of God based on what's happening to me in time I I am a Son of God based on what God did in eternity before I ever came into time my when he comes in the fullness of his power he will come exactly the way he come on the day of Pentecost there will not be one thing different there will be an enthusiasm that will burn in your heart that'll make you so happy and full of joy amen till you will stagger like you were full of strong drink now think about that amen for the scripture said be not drunk upon strong drink which biteth like an adder and stingeth like a serpent amen but be ye drunk on the spirit and I read that definition brother Ben amen that that that enthusiasm is a belief in special Revelations of the Holy Spirit I'm sorry but I'm just the guy amen that when I read that amen I got to go find some more on it so I begin to study the history of the word enthusiasm listen to this it may come as a surprise to many people when they first Look up the word enthusiasm to see that its original meaning has to do with the passion for religion it is rather than passionate or eager in interest in general a brief explanation of the word chalogy should clear this up enthusiasm centered the English language around the beginning of the 17th century it was borrowed from the Greek word eus meaning the inspiration or The Possession by God listen to this for the first 200 years or so it was used in English enthusiasm was primarily employed to refer to beliefs or passions that related to religion but by the beginning of the 18th century however the word begin to describe having strong feelings amen or interest in secular matters when I read that amen Something quickened in My Heart amen that the world took enthusiasm from us we didn't take it from them come on the first people to get infused wasn't at a ball game the first people to get infused was not at a rock and roll concert but according to history the first people to get enthused was people who met God in the power of his resurrection and there was a joy and there was a Zeal listen if a bunch of De can get infused about a basketball game or a soccer game and don't tell me the Church of the Living God ain't got a right to get excited about the message of the hour listen we didn't take it from them they took it from us so if I get a little bit infused don't get mad at me I'm just doing what I was born to do I was born to enjoy the salvation of my soul I was born to enjoy the liberty and the authority of the Holy Ghost my Amen in just in just one century amen the world changed the meaning of enthusiasm now you all know that what happens in the natural amen also happens in the spiritual brother said when the church lost its enthusiasm it also lost its sincerity he said now the sincerity we don't have it it seems to be a small interest he said it should be in a time of this Jubilee right now we are positive these things it should be that street porch would be buzzing like a buzz all the jail shouldn't be full they should be hanging out of Windows amen they should be preaching the gospel he said the street corners ought to be full of men and women testifying to the power of God he said yet we believe it we say but we've lost the sincerity and the enthusiasm that is to receive it he said now that's the truth and will never come back until we come down to that spot of appreciation of God for making a way for us listen the appreciation of God that he made a way for us but then he called us into the way he made and he Vindicated it to us by his spirit and by his word that is the Assurance amen that we have listen we were born in sin we were shapen in iniquity and we come in the world speaking lies in case you don't know you were born in the darkest of seven Gentile ages it was so dark that when a prophet drew it out on the wall amen he put a total blackness in there because he could see no light listen but yet God who is rich in Mercy who could not forsake his seed he said I will come down and I will make a way of Escape amen for my seed Amen to escape the age of Darkness listen friends I have not forgot that without this message I would be on my road to tribulation I have not forgot that without this message we would be headed for a devil's Hil and a sinner's grave but God who is rich in Mercy has fulfilled the promise of his word when he said I will make a way of escape and I will prepare a way in the wilderness listen friends the message of the hour amen ought to be received amen with appreciation it ought to be received with sincerity and it ought to have an enthusiasm that will burn behind it yes sir he said the message of the hour now I'll just say this the message of the hour amen has restored amen the element of sincerity to the church the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 5 it says Purge out therefore the old Leen that she may have a new lump that you may be a new love rather as you are in leaven for even Christ Our Passover Lamb is sacrificed for us look at this word leav it is entrenched mental and moral corruption it is viewed in its tend tcy to infect others leaven is applied to that which amen though small in quality or quantity rather but yet by its influence it thoroughly pervades a thing it is either a good sense in the parable of Matthew 13:33 or in a bad sense amen of a pernicious influence listen a little leav leth a whole lump so when you start changing parts of this message though you just change a little bit and you just add a little bit to it or you take a little bit away from it amen you are opening the door amen for the leav of the devil Amen to pervade the entire church the Bible said therefore let us keep the feast amen not with o 11 neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth amen so that tells me that the feast or the or the or the place that we've been called to amen is not just anything but it is a spiritual Feast with the Lord now brother B comes along and says some people they make the gospel a funeral procession he said they go to church like it was a funeral procession he said but then others they make it a Frolic he said some of them make it a Frolic just a big time to go play a bunch of music jump up and down on a platform Dance all over the platform or down the aisle run and sit down and talk about their neighbor he said that's right and then some of them thinks they ought to stand amen and say the doxology and the Apostles Creed he said I want somebody to show me the thing written in the Apostles Creed I believe in the Holy Roman Catholic Church he said I don't or they say I believe in communion of saints he said that is spiritualism he said but they're so busy making those things up that they make it a funeral procession how many thankful for a prophet he said it's not a funeral procession and neither is it a Frolic amen but it is a feast with Christ when the Believers come and D listen this message is not a bunch of Frolic and neither is it an icicle amen this message is a feast on the bread of his presence by the revelation of his word then I say this is a church I believe there are some things amen that we can afford to lose is that okay amen can I just give you a few I believe we can afford to lose the cold the complacent and the critical Spirits I believe we can afford Amen to lose the formal spirits and the fussing spirits and the fighting Spirits you know I believe we can afford to lose the doubtful spirits and the dull spirits and the dead spirits but let me say it as plain as I know how there is one thing that we as the Church of the Living God cannot afford to lose and that is our enthusiasm and our sincerity in both sermons brother Ram preaches the Easter seal and the rising of the sun he takes his text from Romans 8 11 and says if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead amen dwell in you that he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you look at this word Quicken it means to be Gat or to Bear living young it means to restore to life it means to give increase of life it is of the spirit quickening as respects God have mercy it is the end doing with new and greater powers of Life metaphorically it is of seeds that are quickened into life amen example of germinating springing up or growing I love a prophet's words he said we did not become the seed amen by the rebirth amen we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened because in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken listen if there's not a seed in your soul then there's not a potential amen for a birth that will bring a quickening power but if there is a seed in your soul then when the spirit of God begins to move there will be a dual sun rising in the last days he said the first Sun that Rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the Earth and it'll be mortal life he said but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sunrising amen it was not only the Su and Rising but it was the s oen that had risen to bring eternal life to All God's promised seed that by forn knowledge he had seen laying upon the Earth my my my listen God was not surprised that not you give your heart back to him amen listen I believe that there is a marriage supper of the Lamb how many believes that I believe there's a table a th000 miles long where the redeemed of the Lord will set and they will partake of the merried supper of the lamb now I'm just going to have to be a little Cardinal here I can't help but think there ain't going to be tim tams at that supper I'll just be honest with you amen it don't matter how much of a diet you get on before you come down to New Zealand and you start getting them cookies in biscuits a are you with me amen amen but whatever is going to be there it's going be good but Lord if you can put some there put them there for me but but do you see amen there's a table and it's already ready set listen God didn't make your spot at the table the night you give your heart to God your seat was already put there listen God knows how many will be there he knows who will be there and there's not a question of whether they'll be there see because Jesus said he come to redeem or bring to life those predes destinated seed that God seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in The Book of Life and here they are on the earth without a hope but he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing with the every predestinated seed now if the seed wasn't in the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth no matter how long it kept in darkness it come forth when the S so n shines upon it he said notice he come Amen to share it with us listen Jesus or rather Paul speaking he says it will Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit amen that dwelleth in you I want you to look at this word dwelleth it means to dwell in one and to influence him for the good now I want to say this Le influences for the good or the bad amen but quickening Power can only influence you for the good you say what is this quickening power it is God dwelling in the soul of The Believer by the power of the Holy Spirit I'll say tonight we are under amen the influence and the control of the quickening power of the Holy Ghost he says now we know what it done for him but I want you to see it not will it has done amen this Hallelujah it has done the same for you see what does it do it quickens the Mortal body that we live in in other words it brings it to life now you who once walked around with a great big cigar in your mouth and a bunch of cigarettes and you women once had short hair and you painted and carried on and wore shorts and things like that amen but all at once something screamed and you look down here and it was the word amen see it quickened and you said no more shorts for me no more liquor for me no more lying or stealing amen see the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection you see what it is subjection to what Christ and who is Christ he is the word so the spirit of God is not bringing you subject to theology it is bringing you subject to the revelation of the word of God in the age you're living in if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead if it dwells in you oh Hallelujah it will Quicken your mortal body are y'all ready for this it'll make you do things you didn't do before well glory to God if quickening power ever comes in your soul it will move from your soul into the atmosphere of your flesh and it will make you do things you didn't do before if the spirit raised up Jesus from the dead I'm just reading you a few closer if that's okay it will Quicken make alive your mortal bodies because it's all already life and when it comes into your body it will bring your whole body subject to it subject to what the word of God another place what does it do to our mortal bodies it turns our opinion it changes our Notions it sets our affections on things which are above and the smoking and the drinking and the gambling and the things that you used to do is dead it's Beneath You See You Are quickened are y'all ready for this this is why the devil don't want you to get this quickening power he said because this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already well somebody puts that devil on notice I may still be in my mortal flesh but in my soul is a deposit of the quickening power of the holy ghost devil do what you want to to this flesh but my body has come subject to the word of rapturing hey and one of these mornings there's going to be a change there's going to be a sweep and the old shall become Young and the Mortal shall become immortal and this corruptible shall put on incorruption and then will be brought to pass the same that death is swallowed up in Victory Hallelujah devil that's why he hates us it's C he can't stop us well we might as well preach it Sunday nights the devil hates us because he can't defeat us because in US is what was in Jesus Christ well I might as well say it I don't care if you're dead or where you're at that quickening power never leaves it don't matter if you're alive or in the grave if quickening power is in your soul when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound the dead in Christ is going to get up I want to go ahead and preach a minute Here There Ain't No Grave going to hold my body down there Ain't No Grave going to hold this body down listen sin couldn't hold it iniquity couldn't hold it habits couldn't hold it bad attitudes could hold it because if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead if it dwell in you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah anybody got that quickening power anybody can say devil destroy this body but yet in my flesh I shall see God hallelujah I shall see him because my redeemer is living now and someday when he comes these bones shall rise again and to go to meet him in the air oh I love what a prophet says you may bury me in the sea you may burn it up wherever you want to but that quickening power is eternal that's why the devil hates you it's cuz every time he's knocked you down you get right back up come on y'all ever y'all ever seen them I don't know if they got them over here but they got Inflatables back home and they put them out there in car lots and they want to get your attention you know and then things just flop around and they act all crazy you know funny thing about it amen as you go over there and take your fist and knock the thing down it will fall down and it'll lay there for a second but when the air oh God when the air gets to moveing back in it it'll stand back up because no matter what you did against it there's something on the side of it this crater oh Church of the Living God can I say this to you tonight if the devil was going to take you out he would have already done it but there's something on the inside of your soul and it's greater than what's against your flesh what is it brother Andrew It's called quickening Power and it was in Elijah it was in Moses it was in Enoch it was in Elisha it was in Jesus it was in Paul it was in Steven it was in Phillip may I say to you tonight the same quickening power is right here in every believer who has been born again Hallelujah throw what you want to at me devil I'll rise again I'll get up again there's a fight on the inside of my soul hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what is it God said I will dwell in them and I will walk in them and I will be their God I will be their God and they shall be my people he said let the word of God the word of Christ dwell in you richly in 1 Timothy rather second Timothy 11:14 he said that good thing which was committed un thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in you we are certainly a blessed people says above our thinking above our understanding for if there was a noble among us such as a personel from some other country or a diplomat of some sort we would think it was a great thing to have such a noble person Among Us he said but today we have the god of heaven and not only among us but in us friends the god of Heaven not just among us but he is in US brother FY he is dwelling he is living his life through us oh we're so thankful for this lord it's beyond our understanding listen it's beyond your understanding how that you're still here but can I bring you to a word understanding it's not you it's the word that's dwelling in you richly come on Church you know if the devil had his way you would have been out a long time ago you know that do you know you are a Triune being do you know that you have a body you have a spirit and you have a soul do you know that every church has three kinds of believers y'all know that every church has three kinds of believers do you realize there's a makeb Believer there's an unbeliever and there's a real genuine believer can I bring that a little bit closer amen inside of every believer is three kinds of Believers inside of every believer sitting right here tonight is three kinds of Believers you say can you prove that I can do you know what your flesh is your flesh is an unbeliever your flesh is a hybrid product between an adulterous parent and the serpent that produced a that produced a wild man let let me just goe and say it your flesh is not saved it is a caber and it will never be saved it fights you every day listen it's your flesh that don't want to go to church it's your flesh that don't want to sing it's your flesh that don't want to pray it's your flesh that don't want to come subject to the word of God because your flesh is an unbeliever but if you move a little bit deeper there's a spirit do you know what your spirit is your spirit is a make believer if everything's going good there's no problems there's no situations you're soaring on cloud nine you're fellowshipping with the angels I mean you're too blessed to be stressed you're too anointed to be disappointed amen you had coffee with Gabriel and you're going to have lunch with Michael are you hearing me because your spirit is in the highs of Highs but let me show you amen get a bad report or get a bad phone call or let something happen and that Spirit that's in the highs of high in the matter of seconds will drop to the lows of lows because it's a make believer but why are you still here because underneath the unbeliever and underneath the make believer there is a soul and that soul is the real you that is what come predestinated from almighty God let me say this from my soul I believe this message from my soul I praise my maker from my soul I worship the god of my fathers from my soul I believe on my good days from my soul I go to church from my soul I preach from my soul because my soul is the real me Hallelujah the Bible said there is a spirit in man it is the inspiration of the almighty that giveth him understanding I love that word Spirit it is the spirit of Heaven it is impaling amen a prophet to utter instruction or warning morning that Spirit brother Taz it imparts a warlike energy job 328 that Spirit imparts a warlike energy listen it is an exe executive and administrative power now I want to say this the spirit of God within man will instruct man which is the spirit of truth that was prophesied to come Revelation Jesus Christ he says I want you to notice the symbols of Christ also in the Bible and here on Earth on the earth he was a prophet do you believe that a prophet is the word he said we know that the word Prophet means a Divine interpreter of the word see the Divine word is wrote and that Prophet has the Divine spirit of God within him so the Divine word is wrote and the prophet is a Divine revealer of the Divine word that has been wrote but the way he reveals it is by the Divine Spirit on the inside of him he said because he was called God see because he packed within him the word of God thus saith the Lord I love this therefore the word Prophet means his interpretation isn't to be mingled with now that's a pretty heavy one but a prophet means his interpretation isn't to be mingled with see if he says if there be one among you a spiritual or Prophet I the Lord will speak to him amen what he says comes to pass then hear him because I'm with him but if it doesn't come to pass then don't you hear him I haven't sent him that's the way you know it and then you see the Divine are y'all ready for this the Divine interpretation of the word has to coincide with this last Revelation to the church so a prophet is going to come and he's going to be packing the Divine word he's going to be a Divine revealer but he's going to be possessed with an enthusiasm from the Divine Spirit to reveal the symbols and when a prophet makes a declaration amen the revelation will cause the symbol to become a reality I don't have time to get into it but in the first seal brother B says it like this he says first it was with God he said then it was in symbol form he said then it was in reality form listen the only thing that can bring something from mind of God from symbol to reality is thus saith a prophet and a prophet has been in this generation we are not a people who are following symbols we have received the Divine interpretation or the reality of the symbol that is written in the word of God that's why God said I will dwell in them but listen church he didn't say he would just dwell in us but he said I will walk in them now I got to thinking about that brother Taz how amen is the Mighty God unveiled going to dwell in us but then he's also going to walk in us well third John 1:3 says this for I rejoiced greatly when the Brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou wst in the truth so when they begin to testify that the truth was now in The Believer they are now walking in the truth look at verse four I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children Walk In Truth God Has No Greater Joy than to know there is a generation on the earth who is not walking in the symbols of his word but they are walking in the reality of what he revealed from those symbols a man running from the presence of the Lord powerful quote he said somehow or another I just feel that we're going he said there's something that's laying right ahead of us he said now just remember I believe I am prophesy that great Joys lay ahead believe it that's right listen many sadden Hearts will be made he said great Mysteries will be made clear and people who are sad will be turned into Joy oh did you hear the words of a prophet I am prophesying to you there are great Joys that are laying ahead of the church listen there are many sad Hearts amen but when these Mysteries begin to be revealed it was a prophecy that the revealing of the Mysteries would be the bringing of great joy into the church listen friends our joy don't come from music though we thank God for it our joy don't come from our bank account our joy don't come from our health our joy don't come from where we work or where we go to school our joy comes from the revealing of the word of God in the age that we're living in that's why I can stand here tonight and say this joy that I have the world didn't give it to me this joy that I have the devil didn't give it to me oh the world didn't give it to me and the devil didn't give it to me so the world can't take it away and the devil can't take it away bad days can't take it away sorrowful days can't take it away I know who I am in the word hallelujah amen that when these Mysteries begin to be revealed it was a prophecy that great joy it was a prophecy that when these things become Revelation a great joy will come in the church now in 1962 brother B preaches the restoration of the brid tree he says I've got two pages of fruit that the worms have eaten off of the bride tree he said one of them is the fruit of Joy I want you to watch this we find out he took away the joy David one time said I lost the joy of my salvation he didn't lose his salvation he lost the joy of it but he just cried Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation said restoration of Joy so this little Palmer worm to eat that fruit of joy out now look you here you people make too much noise I tell you all this crying this singing amen and this shouting that's nonsense there's nothing to that see the first thing you know he sat in a big morg you know set out there all them dead and some of them in bombing fluids of so-called doctrine of Creeds he pumped into their veins where the spirit of God ought to be running listen The Same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead ought to be running in the veins of every believer who believes in the power of his resurrection he said but the old church Creek pumped in there no wonder they I see cold and dead and oh can I preach brother sister and their spiritual thermometer is 90 below zero yeah somebody says amen everybody stretched their neck around like some kind of goose or something want to know what's said it's a shame well let's just say what a prophet said it's a shame when the church and the SP of God ought to be joy peace and love but this little old bug started eating on it and he eat all the joy away remember when there used to be joy in going to church remember when you used to couldn't wait to get to the house of God remember when you couldn't wait for the songs to Be Sung remember when ever quote was like the first time you ever heard it do you remember when you couldn't go to church and that oh god well I might as well just preach it's my last night here you you remember when the Holy Ghost took over and you forgot what time it was remember those days remember when the power of God come among you and the manifestation of God was seen and you didn't care if it was 9:00 or 10:00 or 2:00 you were just happy to be in the presence of God with an authority upon your heart well you know what I say I say it's time to bring it back I say it's time Amen to bring joy back to the house of God come on church I don't think our babies ought to have to go to a bar room to enjoy a high I don't think our kids ought to dance their first dance on the barroom floor I think we as Eagles ought to create an atmosphere where the Holy Ghost can come in and we can enjoy the Revelation that would turn sadness into Joy Hallelujah somebody say well preacher that's just a bunch of emotion well I beg to differ with you you say preacher that's not of that's not of God I beg to differ with you my Prophet said that where the word is preached there will be an enthusiasm I just might as well goad and get it out there amen if a bunch of Pentecostals that deacons have been married four times and Bob haired women and wearing high heel shoes can dance at a set of drums or they can shout over a good new song then don't tell me the Bride of Jesus Christ who has receiv the revelation of the mysteries of God don't have a right to enjoy herself in the house of God I don't care no more I don't care what they say about me I don't care what they write about me I know who I am I am a Son of God I have been called by the message of the hour and my Father in Heaven Has No Greater Joy than to know that I am walking in the reality of the seventh seal I am walking in the authority of the godhead I am walking with a clear understanding of what happened in the Garden of Eden I am walking Hallelujah I'm walking as an eagle yes I've got problems yes I've got situations but I got joy I got joy brother T I got joy I got joy in my hands I got joy in my feet I got joy in my soul I believe the message Hallelujah it's a fire and it's shut up in my [Applause] bones I will [Applause] restore I the Lord will restore the joy back to the house of [Applause] God I the Lord will restore somebody say well I don't like all them people standing up leave them alone they got [Applause] joy I'm sorry I just got a B A buddy of mine statement brother Ron Spencer he said you get tired of people standing up in front of you and you can't see in front of them just stand up behind them I got joy brother Andrew I'm sorry sorry when the seventh seal come open it didn't drive me to depression it didn't drive me to confusion somebody say we need a Revival open up your eyes we're in a Revival it's the greatest Revival that has ever hit the face of the Earth it's not a man's Revival it's the bride's Revival it's the Thundering of seven Thunders it's the opening of Seven Seals it's the word in full strength being born into full manifestation again it's more than an emotion it's more than a feeling it's an enthusiasm and you know where it's coming from a special [Applause] Revelation so there is a connection between what you're eating and the fruit you're bearing my Bible says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith un the church to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Mana listen this hidden Mana Bram says it's a little something special what is the special the blessings of the Holy Ghost oh no that's for the whole congregation but the hidden Mana was a special Revelation ca he had to teach the other see was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach others so hidden Mana was a type of the shoe bread which was reserved for the priest listen it was a special thing made for the priest that is the leaders and this man overcome the whole congregation got manner but he got a hidden special manner or a special Revelation oh of who Jesus was and what about him and all about him see he got that Revelation if he had had overcome to the angel now look I know brother says I will give him the hidden Mana we all know that Mana was angel food it was what God sent down upon the grass for Israel at the time of their wanderings so when Israel was wondering the way God ended their wonderings was by sending down Mana that had the ability to cause them to know rather than to wonder oh Church of the Living God in 1963 a Prophet come to a pull pit and said you wonder about this first seal you wonder about the voice of God he said turn to St John chap 12 and you won't have to wonder no more are you hearing me my Bible says in Revelation 13 that all on the earth they wondered and they were amazed at this Beast this power except for those whose names was recorded on the Lamb's Book of Life when the seals broke open listen there's oh God hallelujah brother Chris there's been many generations that has believed there names was on the Lamb's Book of Life but now for the first time in Seven Ages there is a group of people on the face of the Earth who is no longer wondering if their names are on the Lamb's Book of Life but they know their names you say how do you know your name is there because I've got a food and the food I'm eating has caused me to quit wondering hallelujah hallelujah the food I'm eating has caused me to quit one Wonder in I no longer wonder what happened in the garden I no longer wonder if I'm going to make it I no longer wonder if my name is on the Lamb's Book of Life I have been receiving a food and the food is the bread of Jesus Christ it was perfect food it was perfect food it was bread from Heaven listen in every age the mess of the Lord of that age was given the revelation of God for that specific purpose or that specific period now let me just say this we are not feeding on enthusiasm we're not feeding on it but there is an enthusiasm coming from what we're feeding on 1965 if you neglect to feed the Holy Spirit the word of God Jesus said every word shall be by the Holy Spirit listen now if you try to feed it the wrong thing if it's the genuine Hool Holy Spirit in you it will know the difference now remember the word of God is what the Holy Spirit feeds on it don't feed on enthusiasm it don't feed on education it doesn't feed on Church going it doesn't feed on theologies there is a lot of difference between an inspired something and a theological standpoint of it now I'm just going to go ahead and say it amen the seventh seal is not a theology the seventh seal is not a teaching or it's not an education the seventh seal is the announcing of the return of Jesus Christ back to the church what is it it's Luke 17:30 in the day when the son of man is revealed listen the bride's Revival the enthusiasm in this bride is coming from the opening of the word somebody say well all that shouting and dancing in churches that's Pentecostalism well let me just say this I have preached in a Pentecostal church I was invited one time to preach the wildest experience in my life I went in there man I had a sermon it is written God has sent a prophet and I was just about 16 17 years old didn't know no better than just to say what a prophet said and thank God I still don't know no better so I just went in there and started preaching well before I went up there to preach there was the pastor he come to me listen there were people shouting dancing AES full altar full speaking in tongues Pastor walked by me brother brother Chris he he leaned over my shoulder he said now young man he said I know you've been invited here to preach he said but the Holy Ghost has done done his work he says if you just want to close out and not preach you can well young dumb stupid me you know I just turned around I said well brother you invited me here to preach if it's okay I'll just preach a little bit he said brother do what you want to so I opened my Bible let me show you a difference amen as long as the book was closed and there was no preaching they were shouting the aisles but the minute I opened the book and begin to preach Matthew chapter 4 that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God it was like you backed a fire truck in there and hooked up a water hose and watered that crowd down that was the quietest crowd I ever seen in my life you know what dwn don't me they got quiet when the word come open but do you know the difference in this bride we didn't get quiet when the word come open we got loud when the word come open because it was more than just a church service it was an enthusiasm in the de of our soul for the first time we were hearing from God the son of man was being revealed the son of man has already come from Glory he is revealing himself what is to reveal the son of man it is the word that is again waved over the people and the Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit he is right Among Us and is giving us life 1964 when you see the son of man revealed the food the word come back in human flesh 1964 the son of oh God the son of man is to be prophesied to be revealed what hallelujah what kind of revelation will it be it will be the revelation of his living after being crucified for 1900 years but he is raised from the dead and is alive with us in that day when the son of man is being revealed revealed a son of man are you ready for this you know what it is it's Jesus Christ made manifest among his people the revealing of the son of man is the manifesting of Jesus Christ among his people without tradition listen we are feeding on the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man his word words will fail but you're feeding oh God on the unfailing body word of the son of man can I just go ahead and say it little bride you can't fail because what you're feeding on is the unfailing bread of the revealing of the son of man oh Church of the Living God if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above the denominations and things of the world will you do it at this time so there's a bread in the church there's a food coming in the church and the food is going to end the wanderings but it's going to bring a Revival the opening of the word is the end of the spiritual famine come on church it's the end of the lack of bread it's an end of a lack of spiritual water when the word comes open the sistern have lost their Authority we have been restored to the Arian well that was prophesied to be open in the House of David somebody say how can you keep quiet I can't keep quiet I can't contain myself when I start thinking about God who love this little old piece of Tennessee dirt so much that in the middle of a famine he would call me to a feast he would call me not to a Frolic not to a funeral procession but to a feast and there would be bread on the table there would be Authority on the table somebody say what are you talking about I'm talking about we have come Beyond imag inary interpretation we have come to the revelation of the word of God said this he said all right they lived right in the word speaking those men but they formed their own way of it listen oh my I'm running out of time they lived right in the word but they had speak to the priest they had formed their own way of it and their children had accepted it in such a way that the fathers had taught it until the fathers had taught it off of the real way and they made such an organization out of it now this is a bad condition brother Andrew till when the spirit tried to present truth they couldn't receive it that's the same thing today let me just say this somewhere sometime false doctrines have got to die somewhere sometime generational fights have got to die I'm just going to take my Liberty here and preach we are a new generation and listen I can't help what other preachers in Generations before me have done with this message but I refuse to give my voice to an imaginary interpretation when I have received the perfect interpretation with Divine [Applause] Vindication now you know what I'm talking about amen because years ago somebody amen we were talking about it today at lunch amen years ago somebody broke into the revelation of the seventh seal and then somebody didn't believe they ought to be preaching it so what they do they just shut down and that's idolatry and that's heresy and you know what happened amen men started out on trails are different from a prophet and begin to teach things contrary to what a prophet said we might as well preach we're this close to it perfect example go in some places and quote seven Thunders and watch the whole atmosphere change you know why it changes because a man's imaginary interpretation of what those seven Thunders has plagued generations for years but let me just go ahead and say it this is a new generation come on it's a new generation so we are called to possess the land come on we are a Joshua generation listen we are called to let the old Fighters take their fight and die off but this new generation will rise and will take the land of inheritance what are you saying I'm saying the spirit of God will come among the church and will present the present day truth and there will be somebody in position to receive the word of Truth and they will receive it without question they will receive it with authority what are you saying preacher I'm saying the Revival is not dying the Revival is growing you say preacher what are you getting at now let me just say this brother BM said all he said listen see the Revival itself amongst the churches 1965 ashamed he says the Revival itself self amongst the churches had died everyone knows that you feel in the Tabernacle you feel it everywhere there's a thump there's a dead feeling there's just something isn't right listen it's because the Revival enthusiasm has gone away from the people he said you go in the churches and you'll see them sitting there and the pastor stumbling around for a message and something other and the first thing you know he turned it off on some kind of a party or something it seems to be a dead thump everywhere 19 65 2 years since the seals have been opened and there's already a dead thump among the church you know a few days ago or a months ago I was sitting and I was just studying brother Taz and as I was studying the spirit of the Lord just come up my heart and it spoke these words I actually just wrote them down it said this if we lose our enthusiasm of the belief of special Revelations we will become embarrassed to them yes I said my Lord if we lose our enthusiasm of the special Revelations that have been brought to this bride by the message of the hour we will become embarrassed to them and then it dawned on me we got preachers taking the pictures out of their churches well let's go on we're this close to it put your seat belt on it's unexpected rough air it's turbulence but we'll get through it amen amen take the pictures of brother brandom out take the pillar of fire out come on Church you know why because it's an age of pressure they become embarrassed to be identified with what God has done in this generation and so the message churches become just another denominational Church well we might as well preach and people start saying don't quote brother brandom and don't say what a prophet said but you know what amazes me is men are not afraid to quote Charles Spurgeon they will stand behind the poophead and quote Charles Spurgeon who was a cigar smoking preacher and won't quote William Brandon they'll quote Church Hill or quote woodro Wilson or quote some politician but they won't quote Oh Come On Church they won't quote a prophet of God you know why because every devil in hell raises up when you identify that there's a messenger among the church oh God in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the wondering shall be over no wonder the devil don't want this message preached when you begin to preach this message you begin to bring the god of the Bible in the church and the devil begins to lose his influence well I want to say this tonight I come here to do war with the devil tonight I have come here with the spirit of the Living God In My Soul there is a war like energy in my spirit you say what is it a war to do it's a war to say devil you've diluted this message long enough you've watered it down long enough this is a new generation hallelujah it's a New Generation when it comes to a genuine unrated word of God confirmed by God he said it seems to even embarrass the other group on the radical side see there's an embarrassment about [Music] it old sermon called ashamed identifies the word ashamed as embarrassed and says they become embarrassed I think it's amazing brother he says that they become it he said they won't he said they have blood and hands and oil and fire handling snakes running around all kinds of crazy things he said they're not embarrassed about that he said but start talking about seven angels meeting the prophet and he said all of a sudden they get embarrassed he said when you're embarrassed you're ashamed you don't know what you're talking about he said but listen it's a reality to a man or woman boy or girl who is a real genuine Christian when God made the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you receive it there is something that settles within you then there is nothing takes its place when a man ever meets God not in some emotional workup or some enthusiasm or some religious Doctrine or some catechism or some Creed or Dogma that he has accepted for a comfort for himself but when he really comes to a place like Moses did on the backside of the desert he walks up face to face with almighty God you see the voice speaking to you exactly with the word and the promise of the hour there is something that it does to you he said see you're not ashamed of it it does something to you when the voice of the word begins to speak back to you it removes a timidity it removes as shamess it removes embarrassment and the voice speaking back to you by the word imparts an authority in your heart amen amen can I can I can I share something with you for a second the Bible says that Elisha brother Chris brought it out on on on Saturday morning I believe the Elisha the tishbite who was inhabitants of Gilead s Abel or Ahab rather as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be Doom or rain these years but according to my word now you know that God had sent Elijah to chth and when God sent him to chth he then sent him to a widow of zerath and as you heard on the other morning we heard he raised her son to life now in First Kings chapter 18 the Bible says amen have you got have you got a few minutes the Bible says that Elijah instructed amen was instructed to go show himself under Ahab so what he does is he goes to Mount Carmel and there's a showdown amen between Baal and God now and I want you to catch something they went up there and they prepared the altars they prepared the altars they got everything ready but brother Isaac the amazing thing to me was that Elijah and Bales they both prepared the same same altars but there was a secret you know what the secret was they said don't put no fire on the altar don't put no fire on it because the god that answers by fire let him be God brother B said the prophets of Baal the Bible says they got nervous and they begin to cut themselves are you with me they begin to say maybe maybe your God is is per Venture he's away on a holiday am brother said they were all tore up but do you know that while they were cutting themselves Elijah was resting with an enthusiasm because he had a special Revelation you know what that special Revelation Was Elijah knew the fire didn't come till the evening time he knew there was no promise of fire until the evening time amen do you are you hearing me he wasn't embarrassed he wasn't ashamed because he had a special Revelation in his heart you say why aren't you ashamed preacher because it'll be a dark day it'll be a dismal day but in the evening time there shall be light again are you hearing me amen from there look in first Kings 18 the Bible says Elijah gets un Ahab and get the up eat drink for there is a sound of an abundance of rain you know what they said they said there is a sound of an abundance of rain can I just say this to you tonight can I say it to you from my heart heart the days of your spiritual drought is over the days of your spiritual drought are over there is a sound of an abundance of rain you know the Bible said there would be a former rain but he would also cause to come down for you the former rain and the latter rain in the first month do you know in Hebrews chapter 6 The Bible says the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh soft on it amen receive bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God now do you all remember that brother Bram goes I'm I'm having to skip over a bunch but I trust you're with me he said this he said there I was in that Greens Mill cave he said I saw that vision of Hebrews 6 he said but I also saw I saw a cloud that was coming with rain he said in other words it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest rain now we've had the teaching rain but we're ready now for the Harvest rain he said you know the first rain is when you plant the seed the starts your crop growing then it just before it matures there comes another crop and that's what we call a harvest rain he said now we find out what the rain is the rain is the spirit so when the spirit comes among the church who has been delivered from the dead Traditions by the revealing of the son of man and begins to to present Revelation he said God is going to make a way for man to live again because there would be another spoken word that a virgin would receive oh Church of the Living God there will come forth one with a message that will restore the hearts or the faith of the children back to the fathers listen the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what the thought to be restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come but can I make an announcement to you tonight the Harvest rain is rapturing Faith and Elijah was in a drought they needed some rain you know what he said he said get thee up and eat for there is a sound there is a sound of an abundance of rain I took time to look up that word sound you know what the word sound means void there is a voice of an abundance of rain listen he said go again seven times and it came to pass on the seventh Church age I mean on the seventh time I'm feeling too good right now brother Ben it came to pass on the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little Cloud amen out of the sea and it's like a man's hand he said go up into Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get thee down that the rain stopped thee not and it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and Ahab rode and went to jezrael and the Hand of the Lord was upon Elijah listen amen six Church ages of drought but there was a seventh age and there was an Elijah who was commissioned to receive a rain and you know what he did he went out and he looked up in the skies can you give me that first picture he went out and looked up in the skies and he saw that woo Glory you say preacher that ain't the cloud the size of a man's hand listen Elijah saw the cloud the size of a man's hand but in the seventh Church age our Elijah brother brandom walked out and he saw a cloud but it wasn't the size of a man's hand it was the size of the face of God it was the return of the son of man can I tell you what it was it was the announcing your wonderings are over it was the announcing little bride you don't have to wonder no more you don't have to question no more I'm feeling too good right now brother Andrew you're doing it to me you said you was going to amen you see that right there can I tell you this right here I'm not going to read it I'm going to preach it to you okay brother said like this he said that appeared he said and science took the picture picture but you know what science couldn't figure it out you know why because it wasn't for them it wasn't for SS you know who it was for it was for the elected ones who had a seed in their soul to hear the sound of an abundance of rain come on Church what was the Harvest rain it was rapturing Faith are you hearing me it was rapturing Faith don't get mad at me okay but as long as that picture stayed like that it was a symbol and had no authority over anybody are you hearing me leave that right there it was a symbol and it had no authority over anybody as long as the picture was like that sister lne anybody could interpret it anybody could say it was this I had a friend brother Ed Hunter who was at brandham Tabernacle 1965 when brother BR takes this picture and it is the rise of the sun he said brother Andrew he said we were out front he said we had all kinds of all kinds of pictures there printed he said we were return it all kinds of ways he said we saw clouds we saw angels He said we saw faces he said we saw all kinds of things he said but then we walked in the Tabernacle and he said brother brandom come out and he said now listen there's a picture got among you he said I called Jack Moore who was a theologian but this bride don't feed on theology she feeds on hidden Mana he said I called Jack Moore he said William brandom that's Jesus Christ and his glorified body he said something didn't sound right you know why it had to sound right because it was the sound of a body change that was coming upon the church it was the sound of rapturing faith that was coming into this generation it could not have an uncertain sound it didn't sound right brother he said so I went back in the little room and he said he come back in there and he told me he said now here it is he said if you take that picture and you'll turn it to the right next one you'll turn it to the right brother Hunter said when brother brand Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory he said when they turned it to the ride he said there was an audible gasp that went across the congregation you know what brother Bram said he said here it is that's our Lord upair what is it church it's oh God it's Sue Authority come on church we have not come to just Mount Caramel we have come to mount Transfiguration where Jesus Christ has come down in this age in an
