anoint your word one more time in Jesus Christ's name we ask payment Amy thank you musicians I mean God bless you all good the heavy one here could have Kristin Hannah here god bless you you feel at home amen let's uh let's just go straight to the scripture let's go to Exodus chapter 3 and 1 and then we're going to go to Colossians chapter 1 Exodus chapter 3 verse 1 we're gonna read down to verse 10 I just pray the Lord all I don't want to preach a sermon today I don't want to we don't just want to have church I don't want to just have a sermon and there we go you know it's just my my title before readers I have come to take over so that's my title is where we're going so I just pray you just lock in and see what Lulu so Exodus 3 and 1 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and Moses said I'll now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh Heather put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place wherein thou standest is holy ground moreover he said I'm the law I am the God of thy father the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the God of Jacob and Moses had his face for his afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and with honey and to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Emirates the pigeon sites and the high bites and the jebusites that therefore behold the cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou may us bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt they mean to notice the angel of the Lord spoke to him out of the out of the burning bush just as we're turning to Colossians chapter one and he tells he tells Moses I have come down I'm sending you Colossians 1 and 12 a read verse down to verse 21 giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meet to be partakers the inheritance of the Saints and light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is now notice his position he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning he was the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should awful list well and having made peace through the cross through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in the earth or things in heaven and you who were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works hath yet now had he reconciled amen may Lord bless us would you may have your seats this morning you take Moses here and we're to go through a few a few Bible characters and bring it on down to our present day because we know that God repeats himself you know there's a pattern laid out in the scripture if we can catch what he did before we can see what he's doing today and so as I said the my title this morning is I have come to take over and God now we see in we see in Exodus chapter 3 here that God came down and spoke to Moses in the burning bush and it says the angel of the Lord came and spoke to him there now when the when God comes in angelic form in this way there is a there is a change taking place where there is a people who were in slavery in the sisters they were in physical slavery they are in bondage in Egypt then God came down he said to prophet and he he came down and he will ship them to that prophet and he delivered his people and he was making a declaration Pharaoh these people are not yours they do not belong to you this is not their portion in life but I have come down you are not there you are not in charge of them I have come down to take over I have come to take dominion over my people I have come together than to myself I'm going to take them to their inheritance and this is what's going to happen and if you read the rest of Exodus you you find out that's exactly what happened yeah it doesn't matter what Pharaoh tried to do in the hardening of us heart in the and the rejection of what God declared he was doing in that season God still bulldoze through hallelujah God still had his way and so now he took over then they were once they were a bunch of slaves but then it was a few days after after this they were a people they they had an approach to God they could worship Him in spirit and truth and in that day they meant they were a nation under God so God was their head hallelujah witness like when when Samuel you know when the people came to Samuel there's a few generations down after this instance where where they said to Samuel you know we want a king and Samuel was very grief and he went to God and and God said to Samuel they haven't rejected you they have rejected me so they they they took human leadership over God's leadership but now so we are living in a time now we read in inclusions 1 there that you know that you're that portion of Scripture and brother bran would take Colossians chapter 1 and he would preach a sermon called crisis of mystery of God revealed and to me it's not a sermon it's a declaration he's he's telling you this is this is who Christ is and he has a three-fold plan and you're part of that plan amen and so now and part of that plan is that he would have preeminence over people so he has come now we understand in this day and age or since the fall in the garden that man has been under the Dominion of sin man has been under the Dominion of the devil we we were once Adam and Eve were gods of the earth but they forfeited their God ship amen through because of deceit but Adam knew exactly what he was doing he tried to redeem his wife he went with his eyes open she was deceived he was not deceived but they both fell in the transgression and so what happened is when after after our God Adam and Eve were god of the earth they forfeited their their right of that position and they felt and so Satan became the god of this of this world and that's why we have the famines and the storms and the sickness and all these things is because another agency came in and took over but God would not be defeated Amen he's determined now because he allowed the fall in order to express himself in his fullness we understand these things before before the fall he could never reveal himself as a healer because nothing was sick he could never reveal himself as Redeemer because nothing needed redeeming I mean he couldn't reveal himself as as a guide or an advocate amen because nothing was lost that needed guiding Amen or help were a comforter nothing needed comforting Adam and Eve didn't need comforting before the fall everything was going real good amen and so so he allowed it to happen to fully express himself because we have to understand oh I trust you know already that when when we gather around the throne there and you on the Book of Revelations it says that thou has redeemed us back to God out of every kindred nation and tongue when the lamb takes the book and we're in that scene we're in that scene and so that could never be lived out unless there had to be a Redemption Amen so in reality you say well I'm going through a lot of hardship in life God's doing you yo Satan's actually doing you a favor because the trial is coming that God could reveal himself to you then you can have greater confidence God if he brought me out of this thing you bring me out of that Holy have you gotten me through this trial you got me through this trial amen so now he came down God came down it wasn't Moses that was invading Egypt to get his people out it was it was God in Moses Moses had ambition member he was his parents believe by faith that he was going to be the deliverer they they believed it because they were praying they were seeking Lord it's been 400 years or whatever nearly 400 is you said you're sinned you send your sender deliverer and we're in slavery here come on fulfill your work they had a burden and then they had the son and they believed he was going to be him and they and you know the rest of the story you know his mother puts him in a in an arc you know in a basket that's that's watertight sends him down the Nile and he just happens to end up there and Pharaoh's daughters palace or wherever she's bathing you know and God ordained that to happen and then then God allowed it that his Moses mother actually was as witness and raised him now do you think do you think that Moses mother wouldn't have said anything to Moses as as she's raising him by faith she she sent him into the nut now I believe God will take care of this one I don't know how it's going to happen but it's going to happen and then so do you think she would have sit still no she would have poured it in you gonna deliver our people God's will danger to this job amen God's gonna come he's going to use you he promised our father Abraham I'm in that four hundred years and we're going to come out of this place we're being afflicted we're going to come out with a mighty hand and God always uses man hallelujah God always uses man and so she would have been telling him these things and he would have had an ambition I'm gonna deliver these people but the thing is they ambushed them without God is human ambition and human ambition always fails Amen you know if you have your own if you have your own desire I'm gonna do something I'm going to sort this out I'm gonna you know make these things work out just right if it's your own ambition it'll fail amen so Moses now he had to in order for God to come down and take over Moses had to become a prisoner Moses all of us forty years raised up in Pharaoh's Palace and all the military training and maybe battles he fought us because the royalty member in those days they were in charge of the army so he would have been the prince in charge of the army you know whatever campaigns they fought and whatever more that all had to come out of him that'll that all had to come out of him and that's why he spent forty more years on the backside of the desert imagine here's a guy he was he he he could have been the next Pharaoh living in a big massive Palace all these servants under him and then a few maybe a day or two after this he's on the desert he's on the road and then after having this big thing to look after all this government and there's all the politics and the and the palace and all the things going on in court and then maybe a few years down the road here he is he's got a bunch of sheep he's looking for water and he's having hardship on the backside of the desert and maybe he's hungry he was never hungry back there he could have just gone like this and the nicest meal could have come out you he he really didn't have a natural need here he isn't a tent and he's got a hot tempered wife all these things are going on Moses had to come out of Moses in order for God to come and take over now I'm gonna jump way to the end of my sermon that same God that came down and spoke to Moses comes down and dwells in you I mean because he's got to take on your human battle he's got to come and dwell in your life I mean that same angel of the Covenant I approved by the scripture comes and dwells in you Alleluia so now Moses had to God had to take Moses out of Moses and then he could use them brother Brown says and Paul a prisoner of Christ and 63 he says see see he became a prisoner of Jesus Christ he's his friends if we could only become prisoners he says I'd like to name a few characters here Moses he was born a deliverer and he knew that he was born a deliverer but before I say about Moses I'd like to try to make this statement God always has to take any man that will serve Him truly I say all woman to be his prisoner a man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything that he is everything his life has sold his body his will his ambitions everything else and become a complete a prisoner to Christ who is the word to serve God you might have to walk contrary to your better judgment maybe in a certain organization you might think that you could lift they could lift you up and give you something great that you might flesh but what deep but what do you find yourself you find yourself defeated after a while until God can get a man that's willing to become a prisoner to him God is looking for prisoners he's always done it you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ against anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ even your family your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody you only connect them with Christ and him only then God can use you I mean then God can use you until then you can't going out sometimes I speak rough to people I'm trying to get see I'm trying to get you to cut loose you've got to have a starting place like I sometimes call about women bobbing they're here wearing these clothes holding maintaining their Christian profession you say that's a little thing well you've got to start somewhere so begin right there in your a BCC and cut loose from worldly looks anyhow and become a present of Christ and then just keep on cutting loose till finally the last lines cut loose then you're a prisoner then you've become Anna's grip you've got to get in his grip remember Satan gets people in the in his grip by deceit right by trickery but you have to consciously allow yourself to be placed in God's grip because he's a gentleman he does not enforce anything upon you he doesn't squeeze you through a pipe and cause you to overcome or or or cause you to become a believer it's his invitation and your acceptance of that invitation amen now Moses note he is born a deliverer he knew that and did you notice what the ambition that Moses had knowing that his mother had told him over there she was his nursemaid no doubt when Moses the little boy was born his mother said you know Moses when you're dead mm and I prayed constantly we noticed seen in the word it was time for the coming of a deliverer and we prayed Lord God we want to see that deliverer one night the Lord told us in a vision that you'd be born and you'd be the deliverer we wasn't afraid of the Kings commandment we didn't care what the king said then we know that you were born a deliverer now Moses we know that you couldn't that we couldn't bring you up right remember they'd been down there for hundred years in Egypt see and we wanted to get the right thing the right education the right training so I took you put you in a little arc and set you out into the Nile and I strained at the current taking that little light down through the reeds and rushes and brought it down miles away and turned it right into Pharaoh's Palace and his and Pharaoh's daughter was a no bathing pool and I'd note she would need a woman to raise you and in the end days of course they didn't have these babies two bottles to raise babies off so they have to have a witness and Miriam I sent her down and she stood there she said I know where I can find a witness and come and got me and Moses the doors are all shut honey you're 16 years old now you're going to be Pharaoh son and someday you're going to be the be the deliverer that's going to take the people out here Moses ambitions begin to grow I'll study mother I'll study everything I can you know what I'll do I'll study hard to be a military man and I'll know how to take these people out of here I'll be the greatest general or Bishop you know I'll know how it's done and I'll I'll take them out I'll get my PhD or LLD I'll do it and all those ambitions came to naught amen God had to take him and take because Moses had to be conquered first in order for Moses to be used in the way that God had him in his word Moses had to be conquered I mean God had to take over Moses as this alright this morning a man he's come to take over but God has always veiled God has always veiled here's Vowell dinner and a burning bush he spoke to Moses he has Valda by day in a pillar of fire by night Amen when when Israel's following him and it was the angel of the Covenant Alleluia and then when I'm prophet aways came when it when a prophet would say thus saith the Lord it was that the prophet speaking it was God taking a taking a human vessel and speaking his word through that human vessel Amen sir and then so God we understand when they when they built the tabernacle and the wilderness God was well behind bad your skin's and God was you know and then they built the temple and God was behind though he was veiled behind in the temple God was in there but God his purpose was never just to be in a building made by hands he says you know he says that God does not dwell in a place made by human hands but God dwells in the soul he would ask you Isaiah yo yo yo I I made the heavens you know you're a humans yo yo you're the earth is my footstool laws different things where you asked where is the place of my rest so I made all these things but where is the place of my rest and he's actually asking the question I made all things but where are my children I can have rest I can rest in them man but God wants to dwell in you is this all right God wants to dwell on you you are the place of his rest but in order to become the place of his rest you've got to be he's going to take over you take all of me don't let me go you know that song we sing amen take all of me and so then he comes down this go to Malachi 3 and 1 and I read a few scriptures [Music] Malachi 3:1 God changes us form all the way down through the Bible we understand that there had to be a time when when God Himself would become flesh and he says here Malachi 3:1 behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom he delighted and behold he shall come saith the Lord of hosts now this prophecy I'll see my messager he will prepare the way before me we understand that that was the Ministry of John the Baptist but you see the big part of that of the purpose of John's ministry was to point to the people the Lamb of God because the temple that it says the messenger now the word messenger in the Bible is the same word as angel so it says this messenger of the Covenant was the Angel of the Covenant that led Israel out of Egypt into the Promised Land and so they were looking he says he shall suddenly come to his temple now this temple speaking about is not the one that was built in Jerusalem but Jesus said his body was the temple a mint so when he came to the River Jordan to be baptized he says he was baptized by John and the Spirit of God descended upon him like a dove and a voice came out of here and saying behold this is my beloved son and whom I'm well pleased so the angel of the Covenant was coming to his temple Alleluia and Jesus would say it's not me that thought the works it's the father dwells in me he doeth the works so now God was veiled behind a human veil hallelujah but this veil was not was not born as inborn and sinned like we were amen but they but the you're the fool the sin the original sin was bypass and he was cradled in Mary's womb say he was born into the human race I mean like we are but he wasn't born in sin shaped iniquity come to the world speaking lives he wasn't born in a fallen condition all right okay sure his body age everything but he didn't have a fallen spirit you know like we do so here he comes now the same and then so what happened when Jesus came he begun to gather his children he began to gather as children and he was loosing them from the powers of darkness I mean there's a woman at the well there was Legion had a thousand odd demons in them this is a demon-possessed man who was naked among the tombs and you're in darkness he was he was under the bondage of Satan the scribes and Pharisees were were under a religious power and so Legion came to him and what was happening he is basically saying to Legion I've come to take over I've come to loose you amen from the powers of darkness that you would be my disciple you'd be one of mine and he began to gather the you know John and James and you know all the Apostles because member Satan must be dethroned Satan must be deferred and the end that the throning begins in use earlier the thirteen begins you know and you we could read in Daniel where Daniel saw the you know you know the image of the heat of gold and silver and brass and the iron and the iron and clay and that's the world powers to the end but then at the very feet of the iron and the iron of iron and clay and the feet becomes a stone cut down the mountain not made with hands which is Christ and it comes and strikes the image and the feet and the whole thing is reduced to powder and is blown away never to be seen again so there's it comes a time where the kingdoms of man become the kingdoms of God where it's not this man's world power anymore but God sets up his kingdom upon the year hallelujah and that happens that starts in the believer I mean where the spirit that is in the world amen as death row hallelujah where he's taken out of you like as God says I've come to take over I mean but I I do not make you slaves or I beat you around and make you do certain things but you become loved prisoners to me wasn't a glorious day when you became as love first Oh Lord take all of me you're so glorious you died on cross for me Polly you shed your blood I've been redeemed by you it's such an honor such a privilege to be one of yours hallelujah it's glorious thing sorry Satan has to be dethroned and so Jesus when together his disciples he was speaking to them he was revealing himself to them and they're cool Satan Peter didn't say Peter in the carnal way after the day of Pentecost he was a new creation amen yo same old body but a new man now lived in the body hallelujah the woman at the well she didn't stay the woman at the well glory to God I mean that's why you know the Apostle Paul says this one thing I do forgetting the signature in the past press on to the mark of the high calling he says this one thing I do and that's the one thing we should do I mean whatever we came from forget about it just rejoice that's not you anymore hallelujah be with me amen if God's forgiven you you should don't don't feel guilty are you with me I don't think guilt hold you down and oh this is what yeah the devil says you once did this and you did this and you willingly did this Jesus blood cleanses us from all sin Amen - don't just say Satan take your guilt away Amen the blood of Jesus has cleansed me Alleluia if God has made you a new creature in him he doesn't do that to throw you away the next day I mean he doesn't go I remember what you did you know cast you out he doesn't do that he knew what you did he knew what you did I mean but that didn't even come they didn't even come into his equation this equation is all that the father has given me will come to me and all that come to me on no wise cast out hilariously saying I have a certain number of people and even if even if anyone comes to me I'll no wise cast them out amen and I will dethrone Satan and I'll take over hallelujah he has come to take over friends this human battle this this life we live we're not called to do it alone we're not kalter just with our own two hands and this gray matter in here you know people rely they get self-help books how can I improve myself we're not called to improve ourselves by our nobility we're called to just let go and let God have his way amen you can't never it can't be true there's been a lot of battles in history that have gone pear-shaped because there's been two generals in charge amen the Battle of Waterloo nearly went really bad for the British in there and their allies against Napoleon because there's more than one there's a few battles like that you can't be in charge in Jesus being charged at the same time it's either you or him I mean because it can't be because the Lord member the Lord will take as much as you can give him you know he was invited into Simon the Pharisees house he was invited in he came he he wasn't given preeminence in the life he was made fun off but he still took what he was given they meant he was he was invited he was there his feet weren't washed but he still he still came inside you know he still yah was found in there he wasn't greeted he wasn't anointed a new robe wasn't put on him but he was still there he was happy to take just that little part and it's the same thing but that wasn't taking over amen that wasn't taking over he was just there you know maybe just a draw code for for other people in the feast because of Simon's you know he wanted to have a real fancy do it's a he just took but Jesus still went they meant he wasn't in charge but when the woman came when that woman came with alabaster box hallelujah she placed herself under his feet I meant you saying take control take me over God hallelujah and Jesus said maybe just just mention these words so I'm gonna I've got one thing to say to thee hey I came here I was invited my feet are unwashed still on your fancy couch well you know I wasn't greeted with a kiss I'm a very welcome but this woman why did why don't we invite Jesus to come this is why we invite Jesus come but this woman since I've been here she's anointed my feet she's washed her washed my feet with her tears dried them with her hair has towels I said this woman who though her sins were great Allu you her sin so many amen I now washed God Alleluia and he says to her here's the fountain of Mercy you your sins are being forgiven amen and these Simon the Pharisee in his heart saying if this man was really a prophet he wouldn't have this one come and wash his feet but here was the body you see remember we said that he is the head she was part of the body she placed herself she said Lord I'm not I'm just yeah you're in charge I want you to take over my life and and Simon the Pharisee nough spread was saying there's no way if if this prophet really knew if he was really a prophet he would never have allowed her to even touch him and that's the same way the devil looks at you he with me it's the same way the devil looks at you he looks at the Union says there's no way this great holy God member Satan was he anointed cherub that covereth he knows what it's like to be in the presence of God he knows the glory of heaven and but he looks at you and he says there's no way this could be the body I mean there's no way that you could be part of the body yeah when you're when Paul was writing writing the book of Colossians saying that he is the head and the body is the church he no doubt probably would have read that and said no there's no way these people he's writing to could be the body look what they came out of I mean look at the state they were in Alleluia but one thing Satan you I was once and charged in but then I got cast out Laura to God I mean because God came and took over now and it Moses his day under the blood of bulls and goats God could anoint someone and the inspiration would strike them but then it would leave again but then so so that's why Moses now when when God would speak thus saith the Lord through Moses it was God speaking but then the inspiration left because under the blood of bulls and goats God could not dwell in him permanently amen so that's why Moses you know Moses was Moses when God wasn't speaking through him all right God could not dwell in there because the blood of bulls and goats could not cleanse the person could not cleanse the temple in order for God to come into our Linnet right so God was with them but not in them and you know and the old test was God above us and then when Jesus was Jesus was born he shall call his name Emmanuel meaning God with us but that wasn't God's final destination he couldn't just be with us people he had to be in his people Alleluia so that's why under the blood of Jesus Christ now he cleanses the believer a me by one offering not by two but by one offering here said that he is you know perfect at them forever that were sanctified and so he goes from being with us to in us a mint so for an order for God to take over now he has to come and dwell in you he has to he has to be on the throne of your heart I knew glad if he is say Lord you've taken over Laura to God now the Apostle Paul was a man of ambition he would say I believe it's in the book of Galatians that on heaven he says I was a Pharisee of the Pharisees the man had ambition he wanted to be the next maybe high priest or you know one of the great men and his ambition had allowed him to climb up a certain way so he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees and the high priest had such confidence in him that he actually allowed conceived of Paul take these letters of authority and go bind the Christians that you find in Damascus they had confidence and Paul but Paul was a prisoner to the wrong thing amen god never ordained Paul to be a prisoner to that Pharisee religious system and so when Paul was on the way to Damascus he meant the same one that Moses meant hallelujah he made the same one Gideon me he meant the same on Abraham meant hallelujah he meant this yah he meant the same one all the way down through the scripture because it was a great light shone about him and he looks up as his who are you lord now this world really have stumped him because he would look at the Christian saying this is a cult this is a sick this is no way dissident this is the fulfillment of the promises of the Old Testament if the Messiah really came you know the a stairway would have came out of heaven he would have walked right down to the high priests saying Here I am he didn't come according to what I believe it should be but this light spoken said I am Jesus whom you persecute now I think I've seen it before but the Apostle Paul never went hunting a pillar of fire to persecute that and thrown into prison he was he was after the Christians and he was persecuting them but because Jesus dwelt in them he was persecuting God oh my it's a silly thing to do but hasten his blinding Amen and he was an unbelief religious as he was he was walking in unbelief and so now Paul after this moment he became a prisoner to Jesus Christ and so all of Paul's and bishops you know Paul was a very influential man not like not in the same bracket as Moses Bing Bing potentially the next Pharaoh but here's a very influential man but he had to forsake all those things he says I counted all but dung that I may win Christ hallelujah they say that's an incredible statement to have I trust that's your heart too I mean you've counted all but done take this whole world but give me Jesus because there'll come a time where where the last breath is breathed the last heart beat is beaten and then what and then where do you go so he says he says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ now let's go to let's go to Ephesians three and one I just want to read a bit of this chapter I knew glad he's come to take over we're gonna get through this okay Asians three and one for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles and you why is here Alleluia for you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given me to you would how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a 4-time in a few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it has now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow ears of the same body and partakers of of his promise in Christ by the gospel wherever I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power and to me who am less then least of All Saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers and heavenly places may be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord and whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him wherefore I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this cause I bow my knees and to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named that he may grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by the spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passes know that you may be filled with all the fullness of God so the Apostle Paul is saying that there were things that were hidden now I've been declared amen and we understand that when you'd say that the Gentiles should be the fellow is of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel now it's an incredible thing where you could just take a few where where God would hide it in the Old Testament with you know with with Jacob blessing the sons of Joseph that the blessing that shirt of God to the older went to the younger through the cross hallelujah and we're where Joseph himself would take a Gentile bride and and everyone would be sent from him and he'd reveal himself to us to his brethren me and Joseph we know as a type of Christ and so you know God is revealing just in that little thing I'm going to take a Gentile bride to myself remember husband and wife they become one flesh I mean they became the same body right see so he's just showing there that I'm gonna take Vic God Himself is gonna take a Gentile bride and she's gonna be up in the palace when I'm gonna reveal myself to my Jewish brethren glory to God hallelujah and so there's just a few things like that you take you take Boaz and Boaz taking Ruth and and Salman marrying Rahab and you're all those different types and shadows God is revealing down through there this is what I'm going to do now you look at you look at Rahab for instance though let's just take Ruth remember when God comes to take over you come into a different kind of economy you come into a different order Ruth was a Moabite us out of the covenants of God completely because she wasn't born in Israel she was a widow with nothing but then now so so her her the way she was living near her being a destitute person you know just just scrounging around gleaning in the field that tried and find some grain for for herself and for her mother-in-law that was what was governing her life that's what she once was but then now here comes someone else boys and it may be a bit strong but he could basically see it to work I've come to take over I'm going to deliver you from this widowhood I mean we're not even part of the covenants of God I'm going to take you from this widowhood I'm gonna unite myself with you because I love you that's that's the greatest thing a man why did Jesus die because He loves us amen jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so and it's flourish when it goes from just more than ink on paper to our living reality hallelujah and then so because of the but the loves of boys head basically he said I'm going to take over you're not going to be a widow with nothing I'm going to bring you into the covenants of Israel hallelujah that now you you'll receive the promise I mean that you didn't have under your first your your first night to your first identity I'm going to give you a new identity I'm going to make you mrs. Boaz hallelujah mighty man of wealth and it's the same thing with us we're under the powers of darkness we're like a widow with nothing spiritually speaking I mean by spiritual things are all the matter I'm in you can't take anything with you I can't take these clothes with me I can't take my smartphone with me I can't take something that people strive for for years you can't take it with you so I mean it's given to you for a season the Lord giveth the Lord taketh away and he taketh away it doesn't mean issue no joke you know he says the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord so he was just saying I don't know what's going on but blessed be his name Amen he didn't say oh my life has gone all sideways because I've done something he just rejoice a well the Lord gives just like children they just loaned to us for a season then eventually they grow up and you got to pass them off Alleluia and you know just like anything in life life is but a vapor but her ruse just like us now we will once outside of the Commonwealth of Israel the Bible tells us not even part of the covenants of God but by the blood of Jesus Christ he brings us in hallelujah so once we were you know once we were under the Dominion of our culture or the national spirit or you know our level in society once we were that's why we have all things in common Amen it's like we're talking to brother Joe's ahe's in Angola and he's talking about a so he's a believer he is once here in Wellington once upon a time haven't spoke to him in like six years I think anyway so he is saying he's a mess of Pentecostal church here in Angola just just near where they are thousands of people but they have to have a service for every different language because this group doesn't like this group and this group doesn't like this group so they can't just have Church together what's happened so that's not right but in Christ we're all we have everything in common amen in Christ we have more things in common with maybe your childhood friends or someone you've basically grown up with amen because we're at one spirit we're one mind one heart one a call hallelujah where once upon a time maybe we want to talk to each other because of racial prejudice or whatever more maybe would never had fellowship but now we have all things in common glory to God why because he came and he's taken over all right is that okay now so Paul wants us to know now what is the Fellowship of this mystery that God now to the intent and now that unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God so God wants us to know he wants us to know a few things I meant that we are not now go go listen to Christ a mystery God revealed if you haven't recently goal doesn't do it again but we have to understand now if God has come to take over he is in charge of all things right this is not member this is not a chess match between us and the devil between God and the devil this is not a chess match if I do this and he'll do this and I'll take this and he'll do this and he may take this it's not this God has a will God has an intent right here's a will are you with me it may be quite hot in here but don't fall asleep on me I mean remember God has a will he says all of the father has given me will come to me and all the country I'll no wise cast out and there's a certain number of seats around the wedding supper table and but God uses imagery like this through your for us to understand and everyone's place everyone has to be at their place hallelujah so he so he has to come now come down into time dwell himself with her people to show to Satan even with what you did in the garden my redemption is more powerful amen it's greater he following me I mean that I can come and dwell in the human people that I will take dominion over them by love and they will defeat you I mean I will defeat you as I cast you out of heaven you all buddy you will be defeated upon the earth you say well God doesn't dwell the people yes he does it's got a let's go to 1st John 4 and 2 Jesus literally dwells in people he literally not just not just mentally like a mental idea God literally comes to out and dwells and people that's why you should be able to look at what you once were and once you once loved and once enjoyed and everything and see now you're a different person you know I've seen people receive the Holy Ghost and they look different just the countenance in their face something's happened to them hallelujah Amen why because someone else has stepped into the house si si si hereby we know the Spirit of God we just want sorry we just want first to everybody know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come and the flesh is of God now this is not a play of words it does not say has come or will come as present tense now come I meant every spirit that says that he is come and flesh well what pleasure that you say well he he we're not there in the days when he was walking around in in his body but then he would take care of people redeem them and they become the body of Christ upon the earth amen so this is still he's the same yesterday today and forever he just changes his Vail Amy just like went from pillar of fire to to Tabernacle in the wilderness to Temple I meant then he went to a living temple and then he took living stones he took people hallelujah God went he says program says God is like a big contractor he's talking about your body and the elements of the earth but you know there he goes into Israel he's looking for stones he's looking for people the Builder build a temple hallelujah is just like how how how Jesus knows the samples they went to the temple and in the end in the you know the disciples say look at these stones how goodly of these stones and Jesus really if he could really tell them it's a we said this is nothing this is going to be come to nothing but really he should have said and looked at them and said look at these stones hallelujah look at these stones and they look at themselves say what are you talking about I'm a person isn't you a part of the body you to be part of my dwelling place amen in a chosen stones shaped stones hallelujah because it's like a contractor they get a material then they build the building and here you are I might be jumping around but I trust this means a little bit to someone here you are you may look at yourself saying there's no great value to me but God would say look at the stone however I place it in the body place it in the temple are you were following me I mean I know exactly the part you're going to be in shape you by my word holy a place you where you should be placed Alleluia it says as Jesus Christ as the chief Cornerstone he wasn't a piece of masonry as a person he's God himself earlier how could these stones are you must be how how good these stones are I'm looking at you a Peter says that we are living stones lively stones I mean we're built up into the house of God the temple of God tell Lewis this is that Jesus has come and flesh so God has veiled in people today amen you say this is very elementary now you've got to understand who's in charge of your battle who's in charge of your battle because it's not God with us of God above us as God in you Christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah who's in charge now so he is come in human flesh now brother Browns speaks I don't believe I have the quote here but he speaks about this bride coming of Christ I'm jumping probably we're heated myself but he speaks about this bride coming of Christ now that is not a scary thing to me as we said that you know Jesus's come in human flesh so there has to be a part of us coming as God manifested in you amen and if God is you know who dwells in this thing by your fruits you shall know them you know so what is manifesting where once upon a time I would never come into a place like this and now here I am and now I love to be gathered with you people I love their fellows but probably once a world time Oh PO we probably wouldn't be friends because we like different things well what's happened something else has moved in amen brother yeah yeah it's like brother Bernie said yo he be he'd be there at the platform because no let's go to revelations chapter 10 okay so we went from just just very quick overview remember pillar of fire there in the burning bush then built the tab back in the wilderness God comes and dwells in it God reveals himself as many different forms through the Old Testament and then then he comes here's his prepared sacrifice the word became flesh and dwelt among us the angel the Covenant came in 12 in Jesus Christ right and then that body went to Calvary and then that same one came down the day of Pentecost like a rushing mighty wind pillars of fire came and dwelt in them God separate himself into the body right and then that life goes forth now that is that is what God has done and every time when God would reveal himself he says I've come to take over come to take over your human battle I've come to deliver you that's the pattern so now if we go to revelations chapter 10 it comes a time where there is a fulfillment where everything that Jesus died for would be manifested remember he didn't just die just to forgive us he died to restore man back to its original position as God's over the earth as having dominion over wherever they live now that doesn't mean you kick the mayor out of the city and say now I'm in charge your boy because I'm a son of God that's not what I'm talking about but everything so everything the devil tries to tries to push at you and make you be bound down by that is not that is not incharge you but it's under your feet amen whatever circumstance doesn't matter you know it makes it that your faith is unwavering okay where it can be instantly God can do something or it can be years but your faith is still I know in whom I have believed the promise is on its way hallelujah is that right now it comes a time so he's got revelations 10 and 1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head in his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in him a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as a lion roth and when it when had cried seven thunders uttered their voices now we're just going to stop there a little bit so look John John sees this mighty angel come down from heaven now the rainbow we know there's all symbolic but this is Christ descending right with a book that's come open so everything that Adam lost now has been open because the Lamb was worthy to open it right Ana and a rainbow represents the Covenant just like a Noah's day God put the in the sky to remind him not to remind you but to remind him when I see that sign I will it reminds me I'll not cover the whole earth with water and so this is a covenant angel coming down this is Christ ascending and he has and so his face is it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we're so the pillar of fire always represents God in a form now where is the pillar of fire today I'm just yeah in us right so now if the pillar of fire is in you then this Angeles descended and where is this feet today where is this body hello body how are you amen to this mighty angel had me but this is not a doctrine this is a reality right just like Moses Moses them go down to Egypt to teach some things or I want to take you to Mount Sinai because I'm going to teach you some doctrine it was more than that it was God came down I'm going to deliver my people I'm going to create an approach that they could have fellowship with me but I can't walk walk among men but because it was the blood of bulls and goats it was always a separation between them and God but by the blood of Jesus Christ he's not just with us he's in us Alleluia see he comes the covenant anthesis Christ this is the Holy Ghost coming right you say well what is different between this and the book of Acts well in the book of Acts the book was still sealed I meant they had dominion but I remember if you look at the Ephesian age they aimed at the high calling in Christ but they relaxed and they drifted and the church would eventually drift and go down into the Dark Ages right but they were victorious the same Holy Ghost that dwells in there must well in you that's why brother Graham says this modern church today they don't want any screaming crying acts 2:38 youngins around miserable creatures she thinks they are but that's the only kind that the word can bring forth he says an invisible union of the bride any so so what is he saying about that he says that's that is the day of Pentecost that same God comes and dwells in you hallelujah that's what we shouldn't be afraid to just let go and let God have his way Amen hallelujah it's a glorious thing you say well you're going for emotion no emotion comes with it but you've got open the door of your heart you're gonna let him step in Alleluia so now he his feet are as pillars of fire and that Dolph's member this anointing that came down didn't go away when the prophet went away write this it sinners word that's released upon the earth and that every one that believes the word the same angel comes to them one day an angel came broke away these chains this angel came hallelujah amen giving the promise now everything Adam lost I'm going to go in to restore remember this message is more than God seen a prophet God seen a prophet it's now I'm going to take your people and I'm going to place them where they should be in heavenly places that everything that the devil can do and trust you is under their feet earlier because he's come to take over glory to God now and he set one foot upon the sea and upon the earth now if you read the Book of Revelations there's two powers that come out of the come out one comes out of the sea people people's multitudes nations and tongues as the sea I mean which is the Roman Church and all of its daughters that power comes in one that comes out of the earth this is America everything out of there that means all this culture and religion that has come up it's under your feet amen very very simply everything the devil has devised is under the Brides feet hallelujah that means we don't need to war against these things as in like this is not trench warfare like World War one this is not what this is about I'll build my bunker I'll build my trench I'll build my fortifications and try and hold on to here though we're expanding this is blitz creek hallelujah but this is what has been to be everything every promise that's why that's why Peter was told upon this rock I'll build my church the revelation of who he is you can't you can't give someone a revelation God has to give it to the person that's like faith you can you can Phaethon you can say believe all things are possible but faith is a no so it's not a hope so when Abraham took Isaac up to sacrifice and to give him back to God he wasn't saying I hope he comes back alive he had a revelation I was dead and I received as one from the dead even if I plunge the knife into his body he's going to come back amen those faith faith is that you know why brother brems is in perfect faith he says don't come up with his prayer line unless you've got perfect faith it's isn't that sermon that that perfect faith is you know something's going to happen I mean that is perfect face when you know something's going to happen it's not a hope so let your hopes to become a no source let us sink down into your heart that's like brother Brahim says about applying the token create the atmosphere they'll drop right into it I meant and you've got to believe for your house it's just the same faith you apply to yourself you got to believe for them well the faith you had for yourself or something anchored in saying I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me as it come that way it's not oh I hope he dodged me it's I know you did it's becoming a reality and then so when you have that same faith for your children for your family it's like I know they're coming I know they're coming hallelujah let it become I I know they're coming when how why or when and how I don't know I know they're coming amen that's why Abraham he staggered not at the promise of God was strong giving praise because he knew Isaac was going to come how when well winners really well how actually cuz though I did know though old dog grandma grandpa amen but he knew that Isaac was going to come it was a no so now so brother Brahim says and the breech message he says speaking of what we just read there in Revelations 10 he said that angel comes at a time when the seventh angel messengers upon the earth he says he is upon the earth of time of that coming that's what he says so he's saying that so and he identifies himself as Malachi 4 so he says that he is upon the earth when this mighty angel descends what he says and brother Browns not here anymore he fulfilled the scripture perfectly to that ministry that means he's here Jesus here not in his physical body we got to meet that in the air right we are changed and go to meet him in the air but everything God is as present upon the earth hey hell is opened itself up upon the earth from this day all of heaven is here you read revelations chapter 9 it says the bottomless pit as open speaks about one woe and second woe yo 1st and 2nd were that's First World War Second World War it opens up around that time but then the first word of revelations 10 and 1 is and I saw another mighty angel come down so hell is open itself up upon the earth and then heaven comes down hallelujah we're not in this battle alone member I've come to take over I've come to take over this battle Alleluia and he who has a book open in his hand now if we keep reading so seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not so John heard it buddy but it said seal it up right and the angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up a hand to heaven and he swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that there on earth and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things that therein are that time should be no longer and that would actually no longer means there shall be no more delay now we just read beforehand that Christ created all things so he's swearing by himself I'm gonna wrap this up I'm gonna wrap this up they shall be no more delay so so if that's what he's calling for he's going to do a quick short work upon the earth and he has where he's fire he's found his children he's still finding them they've come out of Darkness out of the bondage of this world amen he's taking over Satan's been dethroned out of their lives and I'm speaking just yeah us as well Alleluia and he's lifted them up to be joint-heirs with himself Alleluia and then not not only that but season first even but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to servants the prophets so these thunders that were sealed up in the time of John it says that these mysteries shall be known of the days of the voice of the seventh angel and brother Baron Moses in 1964 what is the revelation of the seven thunders the seven seals he says yes they are Amen so in the so in the word itself as all the mysteries of the book amen and so that now gives us a power where we will not aim at and relax like the first stage because there's power in the word we understand that it says in Hebrews one and chapter one that says that he made all things right this fondant says Hebrews 1 and verse 3 that we're going for time we okay who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power now it doesn't say by the power of his word it says by the word of his power so when God releases his word he releases a power in that word right just like in the Old Testament there was a word that was released through the law and one will chase a thousand till chase ten thousand you dwell in the land you know you push out all the enemy you will dwell in your inheritance now that didn't give them overcoming power over sin because the sin nature was still in them right but then when Jesus came and he released the word he died on the cross for us amen a release of power now that would take some nature out of the believer and give God would have dominion over them right and that so by the power of that word people could now live above sin glory to God amen and so now he is open because brother brown people would say to them well of the seven seals are you gonna write another book that you've got a you know is it out the Bible says no it's sealed in the Bible it's all it's all from cover to cover right so now when so so when the message now releases the power that we will not be we will not go down into death like former ages or denominator and become a system but the life of God will be manifested in our people amen that will overcome all things now part of the remember a restoration means all things that restores it's not just the truth of the Bible is restored perfect home life is restored perfect marriages are restore perfect relationship between husband and wife is restored amen between children Alleluia the family unit that's part of the restoration glory to God now if that is the case he's come to take over because he's going to enforce everything in the document he's going to make sure it's lived amen it's like a peace treaty or a declaration of war what's the good of signing those things make it into an official document if you don't enforce what's in there that means nothing right so God has opened this word in this day and he is going to enforce now the contents what I have written and I'll release to you in this end time it's going to be lived out that's why he has come to take over because it's not us we cannot manufacture a Christian life I mean a sheikh does not does not manufacture wall at bears wall by the life that's in it hallelujah and it's the same thing with you and I we're not called to manufacture it people have tried and they have blown up and failed I mean but it's types of people that do not manufacture the message but they bear it the life lives out of you and that's why you died on Calvary I want to take my life and put it in you and it's not by what you think you are it's what I've done that's why we've got to forget the things that are in the past that's one thing I do put that on your fridge find that scripture I think I have it in here somewhere yeah Philippians 3 and 13 because guilt bank guilt holds people back forget the guilt he cleans this of all things he with me I'm just gonna finish with this me but he say well how can he take over I'm in the state this is what I've done I member everything I did forget those things Paul said he blaspheme which is the an you know an unforgivable sin blessed fiend he said he said I was once a blasphemer he says this one thing I do so it doesn't matter you say well I failed here my family's gone this way this has happened my relationship with what Evers gone this way this one thing I do put this on the fridge you say well I feel so guilty no he died to take your guilt away taking my sin my cross my shame rising again I bless your name your my all and all this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind who has a few things behind forget them this is this is good instruction and reaching forth unto those things which are before what's before me there's a body change once before me the salvation of my loved ones and family what's before me hallelujah look at that's why we don't we don't look at all these exceeding precious promises we spend so much time looking at all the exceeding negatives that aren't actually even allotted to us you know you get into a mindset of negative things and all this will never happen you know how's this gonna work and you know who's been there hello you're not meant to surround yourself with those things find every exceeding precious promise in the Bible just go from Genesis to Revelation amen and write those down they'll take a long time you've got a lot of them that go do it I do you because those are the things that we're reaching forth what are we reaching for those things which are before what are they every problem I mean how do you know you say well I don't know if those things are for me heavy have you looked at them this now clear some musicians to come I don't I don't you know I don't want to continue on a beam I've been long enough I think but we don't want to just look at this and casually just kind of read it through or even the message itself by the Browns thinking about this the vindicated you know Christ our heat chip is here he's paid the price he's raising up the head he says all the body in the devil can't standard he says the headship is here which is Christ he's uniting himself with a with the people with the body there's been a uniting this message unites Christ and you amen we are not ain't we we're not a dismembered body we've become one now if that's so and the Bible says but you have the mind of Christ with that so I'd say Lord I want to look at what what belongs to me in here hmm I mean look at what belongs to me in here and say Lord this is mine yeah I mean okay lipstick give me this mountain mm-hmm Joshua said remember the same the same God that spoke to Moses spoke to Joshua he says I've come to take over a forest sir against us no but I come as to kept them to the Lord's house and this Joshua saying I want that I want that promise amen and Joshua says it's yours you can have it and Joshua took it and he loved it amen how much more us say well me but time we always think but I've looked at these things for years don't worry forgetting the things that you're in the past now it's the time now is the season well then how do I get it that I lost mine make sure your will is dead amen because if you do it out of a will you can't step out of the boundaries of the word so you can't say I want this but is it in the word for me amen well there's not a haphazard walk God is very deliberate in his work and his walk and there's a protection in those things amen let's just and I'm just gonna but look into the script he's come to take over how's this see if we're gonna work out he's come to take over if someone else has taken over then he's the boss and the responsibility lands on him you can race me Alleluia I have enlisted I want to
