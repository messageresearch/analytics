[25:57] timetable out came out I was really
[25:59] grateful that my last exam was the day
[26:01] of the camp so I had my last exam on the
[26:04] morning of the camp and then we traveled
[26:06] but the Vlahakis family um all the way
[26:09] to christchurch and it was just a
[26:11] blessing because I really needed that
[26:13] time to grow my relationship with the
[26:17] Lord and have a greater desire for him
[26:21] and I'm grateful that the Lord wanted me
[26:23] that and I just realized at first I was
[26:27] questioning a lot about my future and
[26:30] had a bit of anxiety just wondering what
[26:33] my life will be heading into but I'm so
[26:35] grateful that I could offer everything
[26:37] to him and my life
[26:39] just knowing that I can trust in him and
[26:41] just give him everything I have so we're

[30:15] yesterday morning well this morning it's

[30:33] hallelujah and I was so moved but when
[30:37] the card read he said let's go to heaven
[30:40] you know that really moved me and almost
[30:43] you know to me it's a milestone for the
[30:45] bride that one statement was so powerful
[30:48] I believe that it was like a stake in
[30:52] the ground for the bride to realize
[30:56] actually you know what
[30:57] we we are we have the privilege to
[31:01] worship around his throne now so why
[31:04] worship any less than you would if you
[31:07] were around his throne and and the song

[31:12] read it out this morning and people was
[31:16] oh you should read it as a poems I and I
[31:18] felt impressed that that was good

[31:36] meet the Lord will meet your need Amen
[31:39] but if you just sit there passively and
[31:41] just want to be entertained by the word
[31:43] then your needs won't be met like they
[31:45] would if you believe and say Lord speak
[31:48] to me and so I just got on my heart to
[31:50] say that I don't maybe that was for
[31:52] somebody but Amen let's just read this

[47:49] power of God by the armor of
[47:51] righteousness on the right hand and on
[47:53] the left by honor and dishonor by evil
[47:56] report and good report as deceivers and
[47:58] yet true as unknown and yet well known
[48:01] as dying and behold we live as chastened
[48:04] and not killed as sorrowful yet always
[48:07] rejoicing as poor yet making many rich
[48:10] as having nothing yet possessing all
[48:13] things let me just say all things all
[48:18] things are mine
[48:21] I mean let's go to our the Book of
[48:23] Isaiah chapter 55 and we're gonna read
[48:29] from verse 8 here I've only got to verse
[48:33] 11 but we're going to go down to verse
[48:34] 13 so as I have 55 and in 8 I mean say I
[48:40] mean when you are there
[48:42] he says for my my thoughts are not your
[48:45] thoughts neither are your ways my ways
[48:48] saith the Lord
[48:49] I mean change our thoughts are your
[48:51] thoughts Lord for as the heavens are
[48:53] higher than the earth so are my ways
[48:55] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[48:56] than your thoughts for as the rain
[48:59] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[49:01] returneth not hither but watereth the
[49:03] earth and make it bring forth bud that
[49:06] it may give seed to the sower and bread
[49:07] to the eater so shall my word that goes
[49:10] out of my mouth it shall not return unto
[49:13] me void but it shall accomplish that
[49:16] which I please and it shall prosper and
[49:19] the thing whereto i seated for ye shall
[49:22] go out with joy and be led forth with
[49:25] peace the mountains and the hills shall
[49:27] break forth before you into singing and
[49:29] all the leaves of the field shall clap
[49:31] their hands instead of the thorn shall
[49:33] come up the fir tree and instead of the
[49:36] Brier shall come up the myrtle tree and
[49:38] it shall be to the Lord for a name for
[49:40] an everlasting sign that cell shall not
[49:43] be cut off I mean this is bow heads in a
[49:47] word of Prayer gracious Heavenly Father

[51:03] Lord Father in Jesus Christ's name we
[51:05] ask amen
[51:07] I mean God bless your friends you may
[51:09] have your seats this morning I don't
[51:11] know if I can I don't know if I can what
[51:15] do you call it block that out but I'd
[51:16] like to take a if I could take it title
[51:19] I've been listening to the service of
[51:21] the message brother been speaking about
[51:23] possessing all things I'd like to I'd
[51:25] like to speak about possessing all
[51:27] things today but I want to I really pray
[51:29] that you know by the end of the service
[51:31] that you'd have such confidence in the
[51:33] word of the Lord that nothing will move
[51:35] you from it one but that's it there's my
[51:38] heart's desire you have such rock-solid
[51:41] confidence nothing a movie doesn't
[51:43] matter what the world does what your
[51:45] family does even what you know what
[51:47] comes against you you'll just stand on
[51:49] that word hallelujah so now we know that
[51:51] when God's so God's word this may be
[51:55] very obvious but I just want it to sink
[51:57] in God's Word always produces exactly
[52:00] what he intended it to produce so
[52:03] exactly what he thought of and he spoke
[52:05] it it produced exactly that so so you
[52:08] take Genesis 1 when God is creating the
[52:10] heavens and the earth and he said let
[52:12] there be light and the word says there
[52:14] was light it wasn't anything it was
[52:17] light it wasn't slightly light or nearly
[52:19] light or something close to light it was
[52:21] exactly light so what God thought he
[52:23] spoke it and it produced it amen and
[52:26] then it says in Genesis 1 and 9 and God
[52:29] said let the waters under the heavens be
[52:31] gathered together unto one place and let
[52:33] the dry land appear and it was so cuz he
[52:36] spoke it and it happened it means but
[52:39] you know we know with us you know we try
[52:41] and create something you know sometimes
[52:44] we you know maybe we're young or even
[52:47] old you say I want to
[52:48] to picture and so what's in your mind
[52:51] what you want to paint you know so you
[52:53] have it you can imagine something you
[52:55] want to paint some great landscape you
[52:57] maybe see it so vividly but very few
[52:59] people can actually paint what they see
[53:02] in their mind from from here to here
[53:04] something gets a bit lost you know you
[53:06] try and paint something maybe try and
[53:08] even write a song or or you tell a story
[53:10] but from here to here something gets
[53:12] lost it doesn't quite come out how you
[53:14] imagined it or how you thought it God is
[53:17] not that way exactly what he saw becomes
[53:19] material exactly what he speaks happens
[53:23] hallelujah because we know now God God
[53:26] has a you know so for example when God
[53:29] said Let there be pineapples a
[53:31] watermelon didn't appear and God and say
[53:34] well that's close enough so it'll be
[53:36] good enough now when God said let there
[53:37] be a pineapple bush a pineapple bush was
[53:39] formed you know let there be a coldie
[53:41] tree called a tree was formed whatever
[53:43] he said let there be it happened exactly
[53:45] that way it wasn't close enough good
[53:47] enough knows exactly because God's Word
[53:49] always produces exactly what he said it
[53:52] would produce I mean because God's Word
[53:55] we know has a perfect thought behind it
[53:57] now I want to I don't want to maybe I'm
[54:00] just going to jump to this colors can we
[54:02] can we have that back up now we're going
[54:05] to talk about you know there's many
[54:07] promises in the scripture there's
[54:09] prophecy of a bride without spot or
[54:11] wrinkle or any such thing I mean there's
[54:14] there's the Lambs wife the scripture
[54:15] talks about you know there's people who
[54:17] the death will be under their feet that
[54:19] they'll walk from this world to the next
[54:21] world that they'll possess all things
[54:23] where where Joshua told thee told the
[54:25] leaders of Israel that day when they
[54:27] capture as Kings put your put your feet
[54:29] on the neck of your enemies experience
[54:31] what it's like to have dominion over
[54:33] your foes after you've won the battle
[54:35] that's the same thing you know we got it
[54:37] we're going to put our feet on the neck
[54:38] of these five senses and we take this
[54:41] flesh subject to the Word of God because
[54:43] we know the greatest miracle Jesus ever
[54:45] did is he subjected his own flesh his
[54:48] own humanity to the Word of God that was
[54:50] for him holy that was that's why and
[54:52] Gethsemane he conquered because he said
[54:55] not my will but thy will be done he
[54:58] I've taken his own gym he knew what he
[55:00] had to go through he knew what he had to
[55:02] suffer he knew what he had to enjoy and
[55:04] as a man no one wants to die but he
[55:07] subjected his own human lifeless clay
[55:10] amen to the Word of God hallelujah so
[55:13] now there's many promises in the
[55:14] scripture and many times we say Amen
[55:17] but then it's win now we realize we're
[55:20] part of that promise and that's when
[55:22] some reluctance can back up is something
[55:24] I say oh I don't know about that Amen
[55:27] that's where I'm belief comes in I mean
[55:28] because I said it's gonna be a bride we
[55:30] say hallelujah she's going to take a
[55:31] rapture glory I mean she's gonna be
[55:33] gathered around the throne hallelujah I
[55:35] say you're part of it and sometimes it
[55:37] can be a little mingling here saying oh
[55:39] me yes you but you've got to come to the
[55:43] realization it's not your doing
[55:45] it's his doing holy and now this is an
[55:49] 18 what we'll go to it now this is this
[55:53] is the so this actually really happened
[55:55] there's a story of Charles Blondin and
[55:58] any city walks over Niagara Falls so who
[56:00] seen the Niagara Falls they're massive
[56:02] it's not some little trickle of a
[56:04] waterfall these things are massive
[56:05] there's an 1859 and so so because
[56:09] there's a lot of tight rope your people
[56:10] would do things and people watch it and
[56:12] before this woman got in the got in the
[56:15] wheelbarrow you know he was going back
[56:18] and forth everyone's cheering whoo isn't
[56:20] that wonderful and he says could I have
[56:22] a volunteer and everyone goes quiet
[56:26] because he's going along with the Wilbur
[56:28] oh that's amazing isn't that wonderful
[56:30] he says now I need someone to get in the
[56:31] wheelbarrow and people and and and and
[56:35] just silence then eventually someone
[56:37] said and apparently it was his manager
[56:39] his mother I don't know she got in the
[56:41] wheelbarrow and she said in the
[56:44] wheelbarrow and they crossed the Niagara
[56:46] Falls and there's no worry it's like the
[56:49] Word of God he has every divine promise
[56:52] hallelujah and and and we can go through
[56:54] all the scripture he fulfilled his
[56:56] promise to Moses amen
[56:58] to Abraham amen all the way down through
[57:00] promise promise fulfill fulfill fulfill
[57:02] and we see what if he's done it in the
[57:04] past you'll do it in the future but then
[57:06] he says to you
[57:07] he says you
[57:08] get in the word I'm going to take you
[57:10] across get in the wheelbarrow of the
[57:12] word
[57:13] I mean don't just sit there being a
[57:14] spectator get in the words Thalia sit in
[57:17] it Holly I'm gonna carry you across
[57:19] that's what you've got to do hallelujah
[57:22] but then there's a reluctance or can he
[57:24] do it we did it in the past you'll do it
[57:25] again God doesn't change he cannot
[57:28] change Sofie fulfilled his word amen to
[57:31] Moses or Elijah whoever it was he'll
[57:33] fulfill it to you holy be him gonna be
[57:36] willing and now what did she have to do
[57:38] did she have to do anything no she's had
[57:40] to sit in the wheelbarrow just be still
[57:43] sit in the promise and he will carry
[57:47] your cross away to the fulfillment of a
[57:49] promise
[57:50] that's all you have to do hallelujah
[57:54] don't be scared jump in oh but what if
[57:59] it doesn't work it'll work it'll work we
[58:02] can have a testimony service four months
[58:04] in this place and the conclusion would
[58:06] be it works and it will work then it
[58:09] works now to work in the future
[58:11] hallelujah listen her ability did not
[58:14] get them across it wasn't her doing it
[58:17] was him it was him carrying the
[58:20] wheelbarrow got across the same thing
[58:22] with us it's not us that's why the Lord
[58:24] says just rest and my promise just take
[58:27] me at my word
[58:28] don't try and struggle just surrender
[58:31] let him carry your cross hallelujah
[58:35] that's what you gotta do oh but I've
[58:37] made so many mistakes
[58:38] it didn't matter her condition she could
[58:41] have been crippled she could have had
[58:43] all kind of problems going on in her own
[58:45] life she's had to get in it's the same
[58:48] thing with us I've got this issue I've
[58:50] got this problem I got this question I
[58:52] got this complex just get in the word
[58:53] he'll carry you over I've got this
[58:56] struggle just get in get in the barrel
[58:59] and he'll carry you that's all you have
[59:01] to do hallelujah well this person in
[59:05] this person that person who cares I'm in
[59:08] the scripture says in Psalms 23 that he
[59:10] sits a table before me in the presence
[59:12] of my enemies he anointed my head with
[59:14] oil and my cup runneth over
[59:16] holy so therefore there's going to be a
[59:18] time our enemy has to be in our presence
[59:21] kaalia the devil comes against us we
[59:23] shouldn't worry about him if the Lord
[59:25] sees hit a table before me the principle
[59:27] enemy I'm going to feast on the word I'm
[59:30] gonna have a rejoicing time irrespective
[59:32] of who's here what spirits fighting me
[59:34] whatever is going on that's irrelevant
[59:36] I'm going to worship I'm going to
[59:38] rejoice I'm gonna have a wonderful time
[59:40] why because the Lord said the Lord said
[59:43] here's the banquet here's the table what
[59:47] do I have to do just sit and eat just
[59:49] sit and rejoice just enjoy it
[59:52] hallelujah you mean you can sit and
[59:55] feast and have a jubilee in the presence
[59:57] of the your enemy absolutely I mean
[59:59] because my feasting my worship my
[1:00:02] Walker's not based on my enemy it's
[1:00:04] based on him carrying me over hallelujah
[1:00:08] that's the only thing that matters I'm
[1:00:11] it doesn't matter what the critics on
[1:00:13] the bank was saying will they make it or
[1:00:15] he's not going to make it looking at me
[1:00:16] - no that's irrelevant he was the one
[1:00:19] that mattered to get her across it's the
[1:00:22] same thing with us howler in the Lord
[1:00:24] Jesus doesn't matter what the critics is
[1:00:26] doesn't matter what anyone else says he
[1:00:28] has promised me and His Word he's going
[1:00:30] to take me through I'm going through how
[1:00:33] there because he promised to me he's not
[1:00:35] a man that can lie he's going to take me
[1:00:37] all the way hallelujah just stay in the
[1:00:41] wheelbarrow of the word I trust us grips
[1:00:44] you whenever there's trouble just think
[1:00:47] of this picture hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:51] now as I see it God's word as a thought
[1:00:55] behind it now he sees this is an works
[1:00:59] the word became flesh see and others
[1:01:02] from India oh sorry
[1:01:03] couple of promises husbands love your
[1:01:05] wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:01:06] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:01:08] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:01:10] washing of the water by the word that he
[1:01:12] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:01:13] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[1:01:17] such thing but that it should be holy
[1:01:19] and without blemish I say just get in
[1:01:22] that wheelbarrow get in that promise he
[1:01:25] wants you and that without spot blemish
[1:01:27] or any such thing so there's nothing
[1:01:29] that can be held against you it's been
[1:01:30] struck off by the blood hallelujah and I
[1:01:35] were the voice of a great multitude as
[1:01:37] the voice of many waters as the voice of
[1:01:39] mighty thunderings saying Alleluia for
[1:01:41] the Lord God omnipotent reigneth
[1:01:42] hallelujah let us be glad and rejoice
[1:01:45] and give honour to him for the marriage
[1:01:47] of the lamb has come and his wife has
[1:01:49] made herself ready and to her was
[1:01:51] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:01:52] fine linen clean and white for the fine
[1:01:54] linen is the righteousness of saints and
[1:01:56] he said unto me write blessed are they
[1:01:58] which are call into the marriage supper
[1:01:59] of the lamb and he saith unto me these
[1:02:01] are the true sayings of God
[1:02:03] well they said God has sent a message in
[1:02:05] this day too robust in his righteousness
[1:02:07] how he's got to put on the garment
[1:02:09] doesn't matter you know we were reading
[1:02:11] just as a family speaking about the
[1:02:13] parable of the wedding supper and the
[1:02:15] King sets out the invitation and and
[1:02:18] people made light of it he says just go
[1:02:21] into the highways the byways get the
[1:02:22] good and the bad just get anyone get
[1:02:25] anyone who will say yes it doesn't
[1:02:27] matter what their conditioning and you
[1:02:29] know just just get the good and the bed
[1:02:31] I'm glad that fits everyone doesn't
[1:02:34] matter if you think you're good you
[1:02:36] think you're bad invitations been said
[1:02:38] I'd say I just accept that invitation
[1:02:40] hallelujah and then the people came and
[1:02:42] we know in the in the Eastern tradition
[1:02:45] Middle Eastern tradition everyone came
[1:02:46] to one door and they were and their feet
[1:02:49] will wash our anointed kiss made welcome
[1:02:52] and a robe was put upon them so it
[1:02:54] doesn't matter if they are a beggar or a
[1:02:56] multi-billionaire when after they went
[1:02:58] through the door they all look the same
[1:03:00] hallelujah same thing coming through the
[1:03:02] word jesus' as the door how are you put
[1:03:05] on the wedding garment you put on the
[1:03:07] rope you go in
[1:03:08] so you swap your invitation for a for a
[1:03:11] wedding garment there's brother a bee
[1:03:13] was talking about hallelujah so and
[1:03:15] that's what we've done I just heard her
[1:03:18] this message this bridegroom call came
[1:03:20] out he says do you want to come
[1:03:21] something in me said oh oh come yes this
[1:03:25] is what I've been looking for my entire
[1:03:26] life hallelujah amen now he sees this
[1:03:32] and this is in the word became flesh he
[1:03:36] says now but a minute he said have faith
[1:03:39] in God for verily verily I say unto you
[1:03:41] ye shall say to this mountain be moved
[1:03:43] and plucked up and cast into the sea and
[1:03:46] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:03:49] what you say will come to pass you'll
[1:03:51] have whatever things you say is that
[1:03:53] right you shall have it not me you shall
[1:03:56] have it
[1:03:56] what power has been given to the church
[1:03:58] now you can have you can express it by
[1:04:01] mental conception so you can just think
[1:04:03] about it in your mind is a good idea you
[1:04:05] could agree with it mentally but he says
[1:04:07] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:04:09] God that you see it before it happened
[1:04:12] and express it in a word form the word
[1:04:14] takes a hold and becomes material I mean
[1:04:17] so so so when it's revealed to you that
[1:04:20] takes a hold and the word you here
[1:04:22] becomes material becomes manifested in
[1:04:24] your life I mean sure
[1:04:26] so if God's revealed you I'm saved I've
[1:04:29] been cleansed I've been sanctified holy
[1:04:32] what happens that becomes material it
[1:04:34] becomes a living reality in your life he
[1:04:36] reveals you you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:38] that's for you you say yes you accept it
[1:04:40] he comes and lives and yours word is
[1:04:41] manifested in your life what it becomes
[1:04:44] material it's not just something you
[1:04:46] talk about a nice idea it becomes a
[1:04:48] living reality amen I thought expressed
[1:04:52] oh how God see your heart and your mind
[1:04:54] is so filled with God's Spirit until
[1:04:57] your thoughts become his thoughts amen
[1:04:59] there you are
[1:05:00] when your mind and your leading and your
[1:05:02] guiding becomes a direct place or a
[1:05:04] direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:06] that's moving your mortal being oh my
[1:05:09] what kind of people should we be if
[1:05:11] they're very holy spirit has you so
[1:05:13] embodied so empowered that you don't use
[1:05:16] your own thoughts you don't use your own
[1:05:17] mind you don't use your own opinions but
[1:05:19] the Holy Spirit has you so built until
[1:05:22] your thoughts and your being as God's
[1:05:23] Spirit expressing itself right through
[1:05:25] you what kind of church would we be
[1:05:28] hallelujah get in the wheelbarrow get in
[1:05:33] the promise because if the Prophet
[1:05:35] seated about the bride I say amen that's
[1:05:37] going to become someone's got to receive
[1:05:39] the revelation more than a mental
[1:05:41] conception and it's got to become
[1:05:42] material in them that our mind our
[1:05:45] motives our objectives everything our is
[1:05:47] the word hallelujah amen I think that's
[1:05:52] it yes we're getting sorry that's all I
[1:05:55] have but now we read in Isaiah 55 that
[1:05:59] is word so shall my word that Garth
[1:06:02] forth out of
[1:06:02] my mouth it shall not return unto me
[1:06:04] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:06:06] I please it shall prosper and the thing
[1:06:09] whereto I sent it now this word void in
[1:06:12] the Hebrew the root word of it means
[1:06:14] empty or worthless so his word shall not
[1:06:18] return to him empty it shall not return
[1:06:20] to him worthless I mean it will not
[1:06:24] return to them in that form but it shall
[1:06:26] prosper it's but it shall accomplish
[1:06:29] that which I please and it shall prosper
[1:06:31] and the thing whereto I sent it now
[1:06:33] that's what prosper means to push
[1:06:35] forward hallelujah so it's not just
[1:06:37] gonna sit still it's not just gonna be
[1:06:40] dormant it's not just gonna become a
[1:06:41] status quo it's gonna push it's gonna
[1:06:44] it's gonna grow it's gonna manifest
[1:06:46] itself so his word is not gonna just be
[1:06:49] idle it's not gonna be empty but it's
[1:06:51] gonna what he spoke like I said let
[1:06:53] there be a pineapple bush it didn't
[1:06:55] return to Him void there's a pineapple
[1:06:57] bush or Sun Moon and stars they were
[1:07:00] there so every every word of God now
[1:07:03] because it has God's thought behind it
[1:07:05] it will produce what God has ordained to
[1:07:07] produce so now we're looking now in the
[1:07:10] scripture we speak of this day we're
[1:07:12] where we have come to an adoption age
[1:07:14] where people are positionally placed in
[1:07:17] Christ where you know we're no longer
[1:07:19] just you know just fighting the year you
[1:07:22] know but God actually you know we come
[1:07:23] into the promised land we come into the
[1:07:25] Holy Ghost and God places us in the body
[1:07:27] amen and we you know so when it speaks
[1:07:30] in in Galatians 4 about the adoption of
[1:07:33] sons
[1:07:34] it says here come a time but when the
[1:07:36] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[1:07:38] his son made of a woman made under the
[1:07:39] law to redeem them that were under the
[1:07:41] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:07:43] of sons and because ye are sons God has
[1:07:46] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[1:07:47] your hearts crying Abba Father run to
[1:07:50] you be no more a servant but a son and
[1:07:52] if a son then an heir of God through
[1:07:54] Christ so God had in his mind that this
[1:07:58] would happen
[1:07:59] this wasn't just the Apostle Paul
[1:08:01] writing something to make the Galatians
[1:08:03] feel happy but God wasn't ending now
[1:08:06] this is the season you're living and
[1:08:07] where you no longer be a servant under
[1:08:09] the law I mean but you would receive
[1:08:12] your placing because that word adoption
[1:08:14] adoption and the Greek means the placing
[1:08:16] son hallelujah so it's not getting
[1:08:18] someone who's not part of the family
[1:08:20] then then writing some paperwork and
[1:08:22] then they become family that's not the
[1:08:24] adoption no it's the placing of a son
[1:08:26] where someone who's born into the family
[1:08:28] comes to a time where where they are
[1:08:30] mature with their mind is the same as
[1:08:32] God's mind or the father's mind and then
[1:08:35] now the father says I'm going to place
[1:08:37] you in a position of authority I mean
[1:08:39] that what you say is what as if the same
[1:08:42] as well if I would be saying it cuz we
[1:08:44] have the same mind hallelujah so now we
[1:08:47] are living in a time where where where
[1:08:51] we would receive the adoption of sons
[1:08:53] now we know this message is an adoption
[1:08:55] message I mean where people would would
[1:08:58] come into the body of Christ by one
[1:09:00] spirit we're baptized into one body and
[1:09:02] there be you know there be those who are
[1:09:04] the fivefold ministry that helps the
[1:09:05] governments the musicians here every the
[1:09:07] Sunday School teachers every joint
[1:09:09] suppliers so people so God would move
[1:09:12] you into your allotted position in in
[1:09:15] Christ
[1:09:16] whatever that is God will move it to you
[1:09:18] and you'll find yourself naturally doing
[1:09:20] that I mean cuz that's just how you you
[1:09:23] know no matter what you feel you should
[1:09:24] be doing though the Spirit of God you'll
[1:09:26] find yourself naturally manifesting your
[1:09:28] part where you mean to be now if God
[1:09:31] said that they're mean adoption of sons
[1:09:33] this will not return on to avoid I mean
[1:09:37] it will not just be an empty promise
[1:09:39] that has never fulfilled it'll never be
[1:09:41] something that just lingers and then we
[1:09:42] wait and we wait and we wait for the
[1:09:44] promise to be fulfilled but in God's
[1:09:46] season it will happen I mean and his and
[1:09:49] it will prosper and what he sent it to
[1:09:51] accomplish I mean so will prosper it
[1:09:54] will move forward it will it will become
[1:09:56] a reality and it's the same you know
[1:09:58] it's exactly what's happening you know
[1:10:00] in this day and age I mean we are not a
[1:10:02] people that just rise to a certain level
[1:10:04] and and then and then the devil says you
[1:10:07] can't go no more where you just plateau
[1:10:09] that is not the brides portion I mean
[1:10:12] when he said that there are people that
[1:10:13] are filled with the fullness of Christ I
[1:10:15] mean when you would receive the fullness
[1:10:17] of your inheritance I mean there's no
[1:10:19] devil there's nothing that can stop the
[1:10:21] bride possessing all promises hallelujah
[1:10:24] because if God purposed your going to be
[1:10:27] filled with the fullness of me
[1:10:29] Holly you're gonna be placed to the body
[1:10:31] of Christ you're not going to be a
[1:10:32] servant no more you're going to be a son
[1:10:34] amen and it's not by the new birth you
[1:10:37] become a son but you always were son or
[1:10:39] daughter of God remember the reason you
[1:10:41] receive the Holy Ghost is because you
[1:10:42] are a son and daughter of God the reason
[1:10:44] there's a pull on your heart is because
[1:10:46] you are a sadder daughter of God however
[1:10:48] you just got to respond to that pole it
[1:10:50] doesn't matter if you're good you're bad
[1:10:51] whatever you've been that doesn't matter
[1:10:53] if God's called you I'd say here I come
[1:10:55] polar if he said get in the wheelbarrow
[1:10:57] of my word I sound stepping in Pali and
[1:11:00] you'll take me all the way hallelujah so
[1:11:03] we are living in a season where God's
[1:11:05] people are going to be fully manifested
[1:11:07] holy we're not waiting for a future
[1:11:09] we're not waiting for another word to
[1:11:10] come I mean this messages come the
[1:11:13] Prophet said that the shot is the
[1:11:14] message
[1:11:15] he's just declaring the messages the
[1:11:17] sharp hallelujah Amen so if the shots
[1:11:19] come we don't need an eighth messenger
[1:11:21] we don't need time to come and break
[1:11:23] down the word to us know the Holy Spirit
[1:11:24] will teach us holla he will guide us
[1:11:26] into all truth only because we have to
[1:11:29] recognize that this walk is not God a
[1:11:32] man and us this is us and God walking
[1:11:34] together I mean that is the purpose
[1:11:37] hallelujah that God would what did
[1:11:39] brother Bram say in the end of the
[1:11:40] church age book my one desire is that
[1:11:43] God and man would have a true spiritual
[1:11:46] relationship hallelujah and that is that
[1:11:49] that is the thrust of this church that
[1:11:52] man and God that you and God would have
[1:11:54] a true spiritual relationship that is
[1:11:58] not your man in God it's you and God
[1:12:00] walking hallelujah will it show this
[1:12:02] fivefold ministry and those things but
[1:12:04] it's you and God I mean when brother
[1:12:07] Brian speaks in Christ the mystery of
[1:12:08] God revealed and he says that your
[1:12:10] pastors ordained to see you through
[1:12:11] what's he talking about there he won't
[1:12:15] leave you the devil won't leave you as a
[1:12:16] nice happy group you're all happy now
[1:12:18] but the devil will bring someone and
[1:12:20] shoot them with a bunch of poison spread
[1:12:22] it through try and scary faces stay with
[1:12:25] your pastors ordained to see you through
[1:12:26] ordained to see you through what the
[1:12:28] devil coming in trying to scare you
[1:12:31] that's what he's talking about because
[1:12:33] the thing is if people hold on to a
[1:12:35] ministry too much what happens with
[1:12:36] their ministry dies then where do they
[1:12:39] go
[1:12:39] that's what happened what the Prophet
[1:12:41] people all brother brand will do bro
[1:12:42] and we'll do a brother and we'll do it
[1:12:43] but they had to come a time just like
[1:12:45] John the Baptist I must decrease he must
[1:12:47] increase so the word must come to its
[1:12:50] preeminence Christ Himself must come
[1:12:52] preeminence among the people what he
[1:12:54] said in the seventh seal message I'm
[1:12:55] just building a platform for that great
[1:12:57] one to come and a bunch of religious
[1:12:59] spirits get in and they say well I'm the
[1:13:01] one that build a platform for but no he
[1:13:04] says I'm building a platform for who the
[1:13:05] word himself to come among the people
[1:13:07] palliate Jesus Christ Himself to unite
[1:13:10] himself with you that's the platform he
[1:13:12] built hallelujah so if that's the case
[1:13:15] though you know with but but they know
[1:13:18] that all brother Barron brother brand
[1:13:19] will do this because I caught up with
[1:13:20] the messenger and they didn't catch the
[1:13:22] message of what he's saying and then
[1:13:24] when the Prophet was taken off the scene
[1:13:25] Yvonne's in shock how he'll raise again
[1:13:28] he'll come back yeah he's going to come
[1:13:30] back at the resurrection the dead in
[1:13:34] christ arise he'll be there he's coming
[1:13:36] back or not to minister some more work
[1:13:38] oh he'll explain it no the Holy Ghost
[1:13:40] was here to make a place
[1:13:41] I mean but the same one that gave the
[1:13:43] same anointing that gave the word has to
[1:13:44] come in you and then you understand he
[1:13:46] will teach you what it means so now he's
[1:13:49] shocked yo now we're shocked what's
[1:13:50] happened the prophets got off the scene
[1:13:52] what's going to happen what they were
[1:13:54] caught up with the man and not with the
[1:13:56] message but now we're not caught up with
[1:13:59] the man no more just like brother cadre
[1:14:01] said at the camp we don't worship
[1:14:03] William Brennan we worship Jesus Christ
[1:14:05] and I'm so glad the place erupted with
[1:14:07] the name in father because it's the only
[1:14:09] thing I'm not caught up in a man I'm
[1:14:11] caught up with the word Jesus Christ
[1:14:13] himself he's the one I'm following
[1:14:15] hallelujah amen so now so now who's came
[1:14:19] because ultimately you know no man can
[1:14:23] save another I mean no man can save
[1:14:26] another I can't give your rapture I
[1:14:28] can't give you eternal life like God can
[1:14:31] sure God can use an instrument sure he
[1:14:33] can he uses the body to give them party
[1:14:36] to life at me and my humanity I can't do
[1:14:38] it I can't take your sin away my
[1:14:40] humanity I can't give your rapture as
[1:14:42] much I'd love to just take us all let's
[1:14:44] go
[1:14:44] done hallelujah but of my humanity I
[1:14:46] can't do it he's the one he's the one
[1:14:50] this messages Jesus Christ
[1:14:52] hallelujah and so now he is here to
[1:14:55] ensure we receive
[1:14:56] placing as a son or daughter of God
[1:14:58] hallelujah
[1:15:00] so we'll not so this promise we'll
[1:15:03] return to him with thee what the purpose
[1:15:06] that it was sent to do hallelujah and
[1:15:08] that's why now we have come to a time
[1:15:10] where as I said we're not here to
[1:15:12] Plateau holier where the devil that's
[1:15:15] held back all the Deveaux the devil
[1:15:17] tries to ward off every divine promise
[1:15:19] just like when Jesus spoke to his
[1:15:21] disciples the us but who do they who do
[1:15:23] you say that I am and Peter had the
[1:15:25] revelation now at the crisis so a Living
[1:15:28] God he said blessed art thou simon
[1:15:30] barjona flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:15:32] this to you but my father which is in
[1:15:33] heaven and upon this rock I'll build my
[1:15:36] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[1:15:37] prevail against it now we know a gate
[1:15:40] tries to stop access writer started
[1:15:43] attacking weapon it's a defensive weapon
[1:15:45] so the gates of hell so so there are
[1:15:47] gates of hell that have been set up to
[1:15:49] try and ward you from every divine
[1:15:51] promise because the devil doesn't want
[1:15:53] you to receive what Jesus wants to give
[1:15:54] you hallelujah so he fights that he
[1:15:57] fights you every day that you will not
[1:15:59] gain ground you will not receive what
[1:16:01] God has but remember God's Word won't
[1:16:03] return to invoice I mean it will
[1:16:05] accomplish that which he purposed that
[1:16:07] the duel will prosper in that holiest of
[1:16:09] God has ordained two people now I'm just
[1:16:11] going to probably jump down a bit but
[1:16:13] you know when god when i say that god's
[1:16:15] word word return to avoid it's more than
[1:16:18] just promises just like a promise all by
[1:16:21] your stripes
[1:16:22] you know by His stripes you're healed
[1:16:24] but when God sends a word he has a
[1:16:27] thought behind it of a people that will
[1:16:29] manifest their promise right so when he
[1:16:32] said is going to be a bride he thought
[1:16:34] of you his wife and the Lambs wife when
[1:16:38] with when John was inspired to write
[1:16:40] that down revelations 19 I mean God's
[1:16:43] thought behind that was you hallelujah
[1:16:46] his wife has made herself ready he
[1:16:48] thought about you I mean what was the
[1:16:51] joy the joy set before him the Lord
[1:16:53] Jesus when he went up Calvary it wasn't
[1:16:55] just the you know just some kind of
[1:16:57] random oh there's gonna be a bride know
[1:17:00] if he knew exactly who was going to be
[1:17:01] there he knew exactly the joy was you he
[1:17:06] following me so was just some abstract
[1:17:08] idea of having a wife know he
[1:17:10] knew exactly who it was hallelujah so so
[1:17:13] now if his word will accomplish that
[1:17:17] which he said to do he says now there's
[1:17:19] going to be a bride he thought of you
[1:17:22] Amen so now it's a person people are
[1:17:25] tied to the promise
[1:17:27] hallelujah so now when when we know
[1:17:32] Abraham was was told by God that you
[1:17:35] know his seed will sojourn in a strange
[1:17:36] land but they will return to this place
[1:17:39] they will they will inhabit this land
[1:17:41] when God promised that to Abraham he had
[1:17:45] Joshua and Caleb in mind he had that
[1:17:48] generation in mind when he gave that
[1:17:49] promise to promise to Abraham now we
[1:17:55] have received now it's so amazing when
[1:17:57] you think about it when God poured his
[1:17:58] spirit out upon upon the people even not
[1:18:01] just not just over there Pentecost but
[1:18:03] the same spirits being poured out
[1:18:04] through seven Church ages now it's being
[1:18:06] poured out without measure and that is
[1:18:09] an evidence of every divine promise
[1:18:12] hallelujah
[1:18:13] so it's the evidence of eternal life I
[1:18:15] mean it's the evidence of healing it's
[1:18:18] evidence of joy everything that's in God
[1:18:20] God pouring a spirit out upon us is the
[1:18:23] evidence that the promise is there
[1:18:25] hallelujah when God gives a promise is
[1:18:28] not just some so something we can never
[1:18:30] receive but God pours a spirit out I
[1:18:32] mean that will say yes it's there and
[1:18:35] it's mine hallelujah so it's just like
[1:18:38] Joshua and Caleb when they went over
[1:18:40] with the other spies and they brought
[1:18:42] back grapes you know and they brought
[1:18:44] back yeah yeah that big thing it grapes
[1:18:46] from the promised land that that the
[1:18:49] others never saw but he show but but
[1:18:51] they showed them here here is direct
[1:18:53] evidence of this land that's being
[1:18:54] promised now you just think about it you
[1:18:57] know you're there in camp these twelve
[1:19:00] spies go out all you've heard about is
[1:19:01] stories of a promised land you know it's
[1:19:03] there because you've heard about it
[1:19:05] you've never seen it but you've heard
[1:19:06] about it then finally two men come back
[1:19:08] packing this big massive bunch of grapes
[1:19:10] and then you're the one of those
[1:19:11] privileged ones I say can I have one
[1:19:12] you've never had a great before that I
[1:19:15] mean I mean apart from being in Egypt
[1:19:16] but I mean in the in the wilderness they
[1:19:18] had no grapes they just had the manner
[1:19:20] and things could I have one and you
[1:19:21] pluck it off you put it in your mouth
[1:19:24] and if the flavor explosion happens what
[1:19:27] you've just become one with the promise
[1:19:30] of the land you become one with the
[1:19:32] evidence so now it's not just something
[1:19:34] you've heard about you've actually
[1:19:35] received a down payment you've actually
[1:19:37] received evidence that the land is there
[1:19:40] hallelujah and it's the same thing today
[1:19:42] when God pours out his Holy Spirit I
[1:19:44] mean it is a direct evidence I mean
[1:19:46] there is an eternity I mean there is a
[1:19:49] new body hallelujah I mean just like
[1:19:51] your healing healing is just a proof
[1:19:54] that there's a new body to go to
[1:19:57] hallelujah now brother has seized and
[1:20:01] possessing all things now forgive me
[1:20:03] that this is but lengthy but just bear
[1:20:05] with me he says it's just like Joshua
[1:20:07] and Caleb brought back the evidence of
[1:20:09] an unseen land that had been given to a
[1:20:11] people by a promise Joshua and Caleb
[1:20:13] brought back in evidence that there was
[1:20:16] such a land now down here they had a
[1:20:18] promise of it God gave them the promise
[1:20:20] and they went right back to the land but
[1:20:22] they never seen it and Joshua and Caleb
[1:20:24] went over into the promised land and
[1:20:26] brought back the evidence that the land
[1:20:28] was there and it was a good place
[1:20:29] flowing with milk and honey amen what
[1:20:31] was it that word they were going to
[1:20:33] possess that land they had the promise
[1:20:35] they was on the road over there and they
[1:20:38] were almost to the Jordan and Joshua
[1:20:40] crossed over and brought back the
[1:20:43] evidence that it was a good land just
[1:20:45] what Joshua did for the children of
[1:20:47] Israel Joshua means Savior hope your
[1:20:49] savior that's the same thing Jesus done
[1:20:52] for the church when they killed him they
[1:20:54] he conquered death he conquered hell he
[1:20:56] conquered the grave he rose up again

[1:27:19] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

[1:27:31] Mountain devil get away from me I'm an
[1:27:33] heir of all things hallelujah
[1:27:36] you've got to tell the devil where to go
[1:27:42] Amen so I said now before so God's Word
[1:27:46] will not return to Him void and every
[1:27:49] promise includes a people in that
[1:27:51] promise now we know that Jesus fulfilled
[1:27:54] many scriptures when he when it went
[1:27:56] here's here he was here on earth and so
[1:28:00] now when God spoke the promises you're
[1:28:02] pertaining to the Messiah he knew who
[1:28:05] would fulfill it he says in John 1 and 1
[1:28:08] in the beginning was the word the Word
[1:28:09] was with God the
[1:28:11] was God and the same was in the
[1:28:12] beginning with God and the Word was made
[1:28:14] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:28:16] his glory the glory as of the only
[1:28:18] begotten of the Father full of grace and
[1:28:19] truth so every promise of the Messiah
[1:28:23] became flesh and it prospered and what
[1:28:27] have seen to do hallelujah it didn't it
[1:28:30] didn't return to avoid when God said I'm
[1:28:33] gonna have a perfect lamb didn't return
[1:28:34] to avoid amen
[1:28:36] though the scripture says in 2nd
[1:28:40] Corinthians 3 and to you ye are our
[1:28:42] epistle Soave be with us on our Thursday
[1:28:44] yeah our epistles written in our hearts
[1:28:46] known and read of all men for as much as
[1:28:48] ye are manifestly declared to be the
[1:28:51] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[1:28:52] written not with ink but with the spirit
[1:28:54] of the Living God not on tables of stone
[1:28:56] but in fleshy tables of the heart so so
[1:28:59] the Apostle Paul is saying the words
[1:29:01] that we have spoken your the
[1:29:02] manifestation of the word that we have
[1:29:04] preached Amen so now so now the bride we
[1:29:07] know is the Word of God made flesh I
[1:29:09] mean we are part of that word hallelujah
[1:29:11] so now if we are part of that word amen
[1:29:15] then we have to recognize if God sent
[1:29:17] his word upon the earth to produce a
[1:29:19] bride amen it will accomplish that what
[1:29:22] you seem to do I just want you to have
[1:29:25] more confidence God you sent your
[1:29:26] promise upon the earth it's going to be
[1:29:28] a people taking a rapture I know I'm
[1:29:30] part of that because I feel the pool the
[1:29:31] deep calling to the deep amen and so
[1:29:33] therefore amen we will not return you
[1:29:36] know that promise will be fulfilled
[1:29:37] exactly as God has said it will be
[1:29:40] fulfilled now he says improving his word
[1:29:45] he says speaking of John the Baptist
[1:29:47] this is but he had an important job that
[1:29:50] was to announce the Messiah cuz why God
[1:29:52] kept his word proved it a voice of one
[1:29:54] crying from the seminary behold I've got
[1:29:56] my doctor's degree that might have been
[1:29:58] right in the old lady's birthday almanac
[1:30:00] but not in God's Word
[1:30:02] he says the voice of one crying in the
[1:30:03] wilderness prepare the way the Lord and
[1:30:05] make his paths straight was he preparing
[1:30:07] the way of the word then that the word
[1:30:09] can be made manifest he says hallelujah
[1:30:11] he says don't you see it seeing shadows'
[1:30:14] stop here for a minute and the last days
[1:30:15] there's got to be a place prepared for
[1:30:18] the word to be made manifest and we're
[1:30:20] now living by the evidence of the new
[1:30:22] land amen the son of man so
[1:30:24] you know we have the evidence that the
[1:30:27] land is there because we're living in
[1:30:28] the land now Bobby C's has got to be a
[1:30:30] place prepared for the word to be made
[1:30:32] manifest now he's not just speaking
[1:30:34] about his own ministry he's talking
[1:30:37] about a bride I mean because remember we
[1:30:39] know in the garden there was a man and a
[1:30:41] woman having dominion over the earth
[1:30:42] right and that was that was a that was a
[1:30:45] type of what you would be with Christ in
[1:30:47] the Millennium hallelujah so now so now
[1:30:50] we know that Jesus was the second Adam
[1:30:52] he was prophesied through the Bible he's
[1:30:55] going to come he's going to be the
[1:30:56] Redeemer he'll be the God's
[1:30:57] manifestation of his salvation you know
[1:30:59] he will save his people from their sins
[1:31:01] that was all you know or prophesied of
[1:31:04] him but that was just the man the second
[1:31:06] Adam but there's got to be a second Eve
[1:31:08] hallelujah there's got to be the woman
[1:31:10] restore del Sol if God's are a fully
[1:31:12] restored man hallelujah because of what
[1:31:15] Christ did now they can be a fully
[1:31:17] restored woman holy that she will be
[1:31:20] made in His image her brother have said
[1:31:22] that she is him why because we are part
[1:31:24] of him Holly is just like you take you
[1:31:27] know we can go into Ruth
[1:31:28] you know when Ruth married Boaz she was
[1:31:30] no longer Ruth of my web she was Ruth
[1:31:33] obviously him I mean he was the mighty
[1:31:36] man of wealth she became the mighty
[1:31:37] woman of wealth because of him
[1:31:39] hallelujah
[1:31:40] she lost her identity when she became
[1:31:42] married with Boaz hallelujah as a say
[1:31:46] and you can take Rahab she uh she was
[1:31:48] the harlot Rahab but when God destroyed
[1:31:51] her past hallelujah God annihilated her
[1:31:54] pastors don't living witness no more of
[1:31:56] what she used to do and then she married
[1:31:58] Salman she was no longer Rahab of
[1:32:01] Jericho a harlot no she was mrs. Salman
[1:32:04] of Judah I live because she no longer
[1:32:06] had her her her own identity and that's
[1:32:09] why you've got it the devil reminds you
[1:32:11] of what you used to be he'll never tell
[1:32:13] you what you are holy but God wants you
[1:32:15] to know who you are not what you used to
[1:32:17] be but what you are holy just like the
[1:32:20] woman at the well here she was she had
[1:32:22] six five five husbands you know she
[1:32:24] thought what marriage doesn't work or
[1:32:26] just live with the sixth one but the
[1:32:27] seventh one came to the well hallelujah
[1:32:30] and we know the woman of the world not
[1:32:32] from what she was but what she became
[1:32:34] hallelujah it's the same thing with us I
[1:32:36] mean God does remember what we were but
[1:32:38] what we are and him hallelujah so that's
[1:32:41] why we say she is him because why the
[1:32:42] bride's identity is in him in the word
[1:32:47] so there's got to be a place prepared
[1:32:49] for the word to be made manifest now we
[1:32:52] know that's the Bride of Christ
[1:32:53] everything that was manifested in the
[1:32:55] second Adam is gonna be manifested in
[1:32:57] the bride Talia it was it was first
[1:32:59] displayed as a mature wave sheaf and the
[1:33:02] Ministry of brother Browne guys showing
[1:33:04] this is what my life does this is what
[1:33:06] Calvary produces this is what a redeemed
[1:33:09] son does he has dominion over nature
[1:33:12] dominion over death he has dominion over
[1:33:14] the devil not because of him but because
[1:33:16] of the Lord in him brother I'm said I'm
[1:33:19] just your brother I'm waiting for him to
[1:33:21] come hallelujah he didn't glorify
[1:33:24] himself no he glorified the Lord our
[1:33:26] Lord Jesus but God was demonstrating
[1:33:28] this is what my blood does and he wanted
[1:33:31] you to see it why do you want you to see
[1:33:32] it because he wanted you to realize just
[1:33:34] as he came forth in that way you will
[1:33:36] have dominion over Satan as well you'll
[1:33:38] have Dominion you will be restored back
[1:33:40] to what they had before the fall
[1:33:42] hallelujah oh one day can we just quit

[1:34:32] hallelujah that your blood will cause my

[1:34:37] self hallelujah just get in the Barrow

[1:35:11] everything away from you trying to get
[1:35:12] trying to get back to a bride for the
[1:35:15] son another masterpiece part of the word
[1:35:17] the word so he's saying that the bride
[1:35:19] is part of the work of a part of the
[1:35:21] groom hallelujah so now there's only one
[1:35:23] meeting places and God's provide a place

[1:35:47] creature and you're in Christ and you're

[1:35:51] manifestation of the very same things he
[1:35:54] did in his day we'll be coming back here
[1:35:56] in this day doing the same thing that he
[1:35:58] said it would do then it's the real
[1:36:00] church you get into it by spiritual
[1:36:03] baptism not by joining not by some more
[1:36:06] but being baptized by the Holy Ghost
[1:36:08] into his body alright it's God's only
[1:36:11] provided way that he is left for us to
[1:36:12] do is to be baptized into his body by
[1:36:15] his Spirit and then and then this isn't
[1:36:19] seen is not ever the shook he says

[1:36:22] for jesus is the word and he is the
[1:36:25] bridegroom and the bride as part of the
[1:36:26] groom therefore the word that is to be
[1:36:28] fulfilled on this day there's the same

[1:36:40] have that again sorry okay that's gonna
[1:36:42] get sick of me he says now so we are
[1:36:46] part of his word I just want know when
[1:36:48] you look in the mirror in the morning
[1:36:50] what do you see DC and aged face do you
[1:36:53] see a tired eyes what what do you see
[1:36:56] when you look at the person in the
[1:36:57] mirror if you're looking at your natural
[1:37:00] self you're looking at the wrong person
[1:37:02] you're looking at the wrong person he
[1:37:05] says now so for so my so shall my word
[1:37:08] that got out of my mouth it shall not
[1:37:10] return unto me void so if we are part of
[1:37:13] his word he's already spoken us forth
[1:37:15] that's why we're here
[1:37:16] we're not here by chance I mean we're
[1:37:18] part of God's Word manifested for this
[1:37:20] hour so we will not return unto Him void
[1:37:22] or it be or worthless no but it shall
[1:37:26] accomplish that which I please and it
[1:37:28] shall prosper and the thing we're into I
[1:37:29] sent it so now when he says he's going
[1:37:31] to have a bride in these last days what
[1:37:33] that's his word that's spoken forth
[1:37:35] hallelujah so what he's saying is now it
[1:37:37] will accomplish I'm just probably
[1:37:39] repeating myself but I feel to repeat
[1:37:41] myself it will accomplish that which
[1:37:43] he's purposed it may be so he says he's
[1:37:45] gonna have a bride he's gonna have a
[1:37:46] church without spot or wrinkle or any
[1:37:48] such thing what's gonna have to happen
[1:37:50] though the power of the blood has to be
[1:37:52] magnified or showed its true power
[1:37:56] hey Shawn truly what it can do it has to
[1:37:59] be shown it's gonna be shown before the
[1:38:00] eyes of the people that we can realize
[1:38:02] yes by by the cross we are without spot
[1:38:05] we are without wrinkle or was that any
[1:38:07] such thing I mean that's why you know we
[1:38:10] can never be too free hallelujah because
[1:38:13] when God said he took away our sin he
[1:38:16] took away our shame he's taking away our
[1:38:18] guilt he's taken away our past he's
[1:38:21] taking away even our future he's taking
[1:38:23] our first birth that's been annihilated
[1:38:25] it's been done away with
[1:38:26] holy what did you try to tell you that
[1:38:28] there is no spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:38:30] thing that can be held against you Holly
[1:38:33] you've got to begin to realize other
[1:38:35] scripture says we shall know as we are
[1:38:37] known so there comes a day and we're
[1:38:40] living in a day when we shall know as
[1:38:42] God knows us I mean if we are known if
[1:38:45] we knows we are knowing we won't beat
[1:38:47] ourselves up hallelujah you know you
[1:38:50] we'd probably don't have time for now
[1:38:52] but the prophets of the Old Testament
[1:38:55] were the word for the age many of them
[1:38:59] had to do a lot of what we'd call crazy
[1:39:01] stuff one was told lie on the side for
[1:39:03] so many days lie on the other side so
[1:39:05] many days I think I say I had to walk
[1:39:06] naked through the streets you know one
[1:39:09] had to make make cake make make bread
[1:39:12] and put human feces in it but he said no
[1:39:14] I can't do that okay
[1:39:15] then didn't put animal dung in it had to
[1:39:17] eat it had to all these kind of things
[1:39:19] but it was God's Word manifested in
[1:39:21] front of the people I'll say this God
[1:39:24] hasn't called us to do any of those
[1:39:26] things right but that was God's Word
[1:39:31] manifested amen you can even take know
[1:39:34] me being a Moabite don't call me no me
[1:39:37] no more call me Mara because my life is
[1:39:39] bitter it was actually Pleasant worship
[1:39:42] him in her her her husband please don't
[1:39:44] worship within that your meaning of
[1:39:46] their names so there was a time winner
[1:39:48] was a place in worship but then it
[1:39:50] became a better life God ordained these
[1:39:53] steps God ordained their steps God took
[1:39:56] them through dark places she had to lose
[1:39:58] her husband and her sons she actually
[1:40:00] had to have a bit of walk why because
[1:40:04] Ruth had to comin but that was what her
[1:40:06] walk was called to be hallelujah as the
[1:40:10] same thing with us sometimes you know we
[1:40:11] you know we can look at our walk and you
[1:40:13] know we can't compare ourselves with
[1:40:15] each other we can't compare ourselves
[1:40:17] because we know your brother Brent says
[1:40:20] it's like you know the bride is like a
[1:40:22] bouquet different flowers they have
[1:40:25] different fragrances they grow on
[1:40:27] different conditions but it's still part
[1:40:29] of the bouquet so so he may call you to
[1:40:32] go through a very dark place hallelujah
[1:40:35] and sometimes we're wondering Lord where
[1:40:37] are you leading me and sometimes we even
[1:40:40] doubt Lord or even leading me here look
[1:40:42] at Joseph's life that's what do you
[1:40:44] think you know our walk is tailor-made
[1:40:46] for us God doesn't get surprised you
[1:40:49] know he doesn't have a stand-up meeting
[1:40:51] on Monday morning angels what do you
[1:40:53] think they'll do today he knows exactly
[1:40:56] where you're gonna go he's gonna have
[1:40:59] confidence though I walk through the
[1:41:01] valley of the shadow of death I'll fear
[1:41:02] no evil so you may go through some dark
[1:41:05] places like the prodigal son I'll say he
[1:41:08] had to go he had to go and be a protocol
[1:41:11] you know of course it caused great
[1:41:13] anguish and and distress in his parents
[1:41:16] you know saying you know they tried to
[1:41:17] give him the best but he won't do what
[1:41:19] he wanted to do anyway he said now I'm
[1:41:21] gonna have my own way he had to go
[1:41:25] sometimes we think the world has fallen
[1:41:27] apart and God says no this is exactly
[1:41:28] where I want
[1:41:29] - hallelujah wait you think man this is
[1:41:33] where's the light at the end of the
[1:41:34] tunnel God says just keep walking you'll
[1:41:38] see it our walks individual but you have
[1:41:43] to have confidence my word will not
[1:41:46] return unto me void this message why why
[1:41:51] is it gripped you because God is
[1:41:53] identifying you're part of me
[1:41:55] it's a merit it's a bridegroom call so
[1:41:58] now if ever it's gripped you you know if
[1:42:02] it's gripped you and you've given
[1:42:03] yourself to it you say Lord by your
[1:42:05] grace I'm part of your word so I cannot
[1:42:08] return to you empty I can't return to
[1:42:11] you you know you know it's like the
[1:42:13] fight your the talents you know we get
[1:42:16] scared Lord am I using my gift for you
[1:42:19] am I scared no the bride doesn't have a
[1:42:22] fair relationship why why that man
[1:42:24] barriers talent he says yo he says
[1:42:26] basically you're very hard man and I was
[1:42:28] scared if I tried to use I'll lose it
[1:42:30] than you'll be mad at me so I buried it
[1:42:31] his relationship with the master was
[1:42:33] based on fear that's why he hid his
[1:42:36] talent but the bright God wants to take
[1:42:39] away all fear why why should we beat you
[1:42:42] no the Bible says in Hebrews 11 but
[1:42:46] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:42:47] him it's impossible without faith you
[1:42:50] can't please God without faith but you
[1:42:52] swap it around with faith it's
[1:42:54] impossible not to please him I mean so
[1:42:57] if he's given you a revelation of who he
[1:42:59] is in this day what's that you've got
[1:43:01] faith you're an heir of all things
[1:43:03] you've got faith I mean so that means
[1:43:05] it's impossible for you not to please
[1:43:07] him hallelujah let's just let's just
[1:43:11] sweep all the fear away devil take it
[1:43:14] back take it back devil you can't but
[1:43:17] how do you try to put your fear upon us
[1:43:18] now we're not a fearful people the blood
[1:43:21] is you know even before there was a
[1:43:23] devil the Lord made away the lamb was
[1:43:26] slain before the foundation of who may
[1:43:28] be so what do we have to fear I mean we
[1:43:30] aren't like that one that buries the
[1:43:32] talent hallelujah because we're not
[1:43:35] motivated by fear we're motivated by
[1:43:37] love hallelujah
[1:43:39] so figures now we can't
[1:43:42] you know I trust you none of us are in
[1:43:45] the position but what if I displease him
[1:43:47] okay I'll just this may sound crazy but
[1:43:50] you can't displease him he can't be
[1:43:54] disappointed in his bride sure you may
[1:43:57] take a step off the path and he'll
[1:43:58] correct you and guide you back on but
[1:44:01] every one of his bride what's he gonna
[1:44:03] say to her well my good and in Turin
[1:44:09] tune that was what prepared for you win
[1:44:15] hallelujah si well done well done my
[1:44:19] good and faithful servant
[1:44:21] hello it depends what you've been called
[1:44:23] to be faithful and it doesn't mean about
[1:44:26] being successful or what we think of
[1:44:28] succeed well done my good and faithful
[1:44:30] servant hallelujah if we're part of them
[1:44:36] that's why the bride can't groove can't
[1:44:38] can't go through the Great Tribulation
[1:44:39] the blood is purged Oh Holley there's no
[1:44:42] fear on the bride no more cause the
[1:44:44] blood is taking care of it we don't need
[1:44:45] a further purging we've been washed
[1:44:47] women clean were being sanctified
[1:44:49] there's nothing held against us no more
[1:44:52] God has dropped the charges he's taking
[1:44:54] care the evidence that's gone you mean
[1:44:57] even me and my humanity his word will
[1:44:59] not return unto Him void we lean we were
[1:45:03] life we were lying our humanity too much
[1:45:07] amen don't lean on the sky he will
[1:45:11] disappoint you get in the Barrow I'm
[1:45:16] just gonna leave with this I'm gonna
[1:45:18] just get in this promise get in the
[1:45:22] promise parlay again the promise of his
[1:45:25] word he'll take you all the way he'll
[1:45:28] take you all the way

[1:45:32] I'll take you from this side to the
[1:45:34] other side okay you've seen me do it
[1:45:37] before now you get in and she's in a car

[1:45:44] Lord Jesus I trust this subbing is his
[1:45:47] Lord I've given my whole life to you and
[1:45:49] where I end up is based on you
[1:45:53] that's why I'm not relying on my own
[1:45:55] self I'm relying on my lamb I'm not
[1:45:58] relying on my own ability hallelujah
[1:46:00] brother aunt said I tried
[1:46:01] he said I'd hate to try and get to
[1:46:03] heaven on my preaching or my visions or
[1:46:06] anything like that he says I'm only
[1:46:07] trusting in the shipload of Jesus Christ
