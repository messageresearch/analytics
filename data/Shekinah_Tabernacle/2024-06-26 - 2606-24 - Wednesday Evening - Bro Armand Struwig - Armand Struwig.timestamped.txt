[24:47] a little bit so you don't fall asleep on
[24:49] me no I'm joking God bless you all let's
[24:52] go to the Book of Exodus and we're going
[24:54] to go to Exodus
[24:55] 14 um a very powerful thing that brother
[24:59] M said in Simplicity and it just stuck
[25:03] by me brother M God bless you
[25:06] richly he said if you want
[25:10] everything you get God first and then
[25:14] you'll have everything amen because what
[25:17] you maybe see before you meet God and
[25:18] you think that is everything that ain't
[25:21] nothing until you come into His presence
[25:23] then you have everything amen so we're
[25:27] going to go um Exodus 14 we're going to
[25:29] start there at verse
[25:32] 10 and uh we're going to go and it was
[25:34] the fear of the people so now what
[25:36] happens I'll just quickly
[25:38] run you into the story and we know that
[25:40] Moses you know was was the mighty
[25:42] deliverer that God used to get to get
[25:45] pharaoh to to move the people out of
[25:48] Egypt to get the Hebrew people out of
[25:50] Egypt the Israelites going on the
[25:52] 40-year journey which took a long time
[25:55] you know 40 years it's a long time and
[25:58] uh what happens is but the people always
[26:01] feared they there was always fear in the
[26:03] camp yeah no matter what God did there
[26:06] was always fear in the camp man a tough
[26:09] crowd if he ever would say hey and Moses
[26:11] he just wants to do his job but this is
[26:15] this fear now I'm not talking about fear
[26:16] but it is a thing that is very real when
[26:18] you're in that situation but we
[26:21] shouldn't be governed by this thing
[26:22] called fear it is not our boss not a
[26:25] boss of us and the best of English I can
[26:27] tell you it's not your boss he says and
[26:31] when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of
[26:33] Israel lifted up their eyes and behold
[26:36] the Egyptians marched after them and
[26:38] they were so afraid which of course you
[26:41] would be because they're coming with a
[26:43] lot of weapons and you have nothing
[26:45] they're not they're not now thinking on
[26:47] a spiritual level they're just thinking
[26:48] hey they're coming to get us we're
[26:50] doomed so remember they were in a very
[26:52] real situation this wasn't just like
[26:55] they seen the Miracles oh you should
[26:56] just believe and move on hold on guys
[26:58] they were going to get murdered Massacre
[27:00] that's what's coming their
[27:02] way and they said unto Moses because
[27:05] there were no graves in Egypt hast thou
[27:07] taken us away to die in the wilderness
[27:09] wherefore hast thou dealt with us with
[27:11] this with us to carry out us out from
[27:15] Egypt is this not the word that we did
[27:18] tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone
[27:21] so wait hold on I thought all of Israel
[27:23] was happy to put on their shoes and
[27:25] March out the door isn't that the story
[27:27] the world says we're just happy yeah
[27:29] just like oh let's Supply the blood and
[27:31] everybody's just happy and we're just
[27:32] going to March out no it wasn't that way
[27:34] there was a lot of a lot of stuff going
[27:37] on in the camp and that's why God had to
[27:39] send all those miracles to get them and
[27:42] persuade them that there is a bigger
[27:44] thing happening and with all that going
[27:45] on they were still not happy where they
[27:47] are right
[27:49] now that's not my sermon but just I just
[27:51] thought about it man they're still not
[27:53] happy with where they
[27:54] are um and then they said for it's been
[27:57] better better for us to serve the
[27:59] Egyptians than we should die here in the
[28:01] wilderness and it's true and Moses said
[28:04] unto the people fear ye not stand still
[28:07] and see the salvation of the Lord which
[28:10] I will show unto you
[28:13] today this day for the Egyptians who you
[28:17] have seen today ye shall see them again
[28:20] no more forever
[28:23] Hallelujah period full stop amen there's
[28:27] prophecy right there and the Lord shall
[28:29] fight for you and you shall hold your
[28:31] peace remember that verse 14 and the
[28:34] Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest
[28:36] thou unto me speak unto the children of
[28:39] Israel that they go
[28:41] forward amen you can have your seats may
[28:43] the Lord just bless the reading of his
[28:46] word I just once more pray and say Lord
[28:48] Jesus as we read the scripture I ask
[28:50] that now you would just come and make it
[28:52] real to us Lord Lord because we can have
[28:54] this Bible Lord but we need you to make
[28:56] it real to us Lord and if you don't do
[28:59] that we have failed so I pray that you
[29:00] would just step forth in the name of our
[29:02] Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen so we we
[29:07] see now that God says to Moses why cry
[29:14] speak and you think but hold on God
[29:17] wants us to ask him things God wants to
[29:21] to get us to a place where we can
[29:22] actually cry out and say help me I'm in
[29:24] a situation where I need help because
[29:26] remember he's got attributes he wants to
[29:28] display so we we find this a bit
[29:30] contradictory if to go like Moses comes
[29:32] and and he's crying to God for help and
[29:34] he he needs Deliverance right now and
[29:36] it's a very real moment and God goes
[29:37] hold on why cry speak and you're like
[29:40] whoa that's a bit
[29:42] just what's going on here but see God
[29:46] knows what's going
[29:47] on Moses don't Moses is walking where
[29:51] God says I'll lead you and he's just
[29:53] following what the Lord is telling him
[29:55] but God knows the beginning from the end
[29:57] that's right God knows how the events is
[29:59] going to unfold Moses is just standing
[30:01] in
[30:02] time so God says don't worry about it I
[30:05] got tomorrow just just hold position but
[30:10] while you're there you got a duty you
[30:12] need to speak address your enemy so my
[30:16] my sermon title for night tonight is why
[30:18] cry
[30:19] speak speak very important not think Ed
[30:24] and I had a bit of Fellowship about it
[30:26] today but not think
[30:28] not deliberate not not keep it to
[30:31] yourself speak your outcome let it be
[30:34] known get that word out there cuz
[30:37] there's an anointing released on that
[30:39] word and that word that you speak under
[30:41] that anointing will bring fruit back to
[30:43] you but somebody's going to have to say
[30:46] it brother Andy said every time the
[30:49] devil attacks him is when he brushes his
[30:50] teeth because he knows he can't chase
[30:52] him away it is cuz now his mouth is busy
[30:54] and it's true and he says every time I'm
[30:56] brushing my teeth the devil will give me
[30:58] these random thoughts and like he knows
[31:00] it because I can't rebuke him because I
[31:01] can't
[31:02] speak devil knows when to attack so now
[31:06] we're thinking about
[31:07] predestination so God looks at Moses and
[31:10] he rebukes it and it seems harsh but
[31:13] remember predestination means the forn
[31:15] knowledge of God knows when you get to a
[31:17] certain situation what you're going to
[31:20] do you still have to do it amen this is
[31:24] where the rubber hits the road but he
[31:26] knows what you're going to do because
[31:27] because he knows your character and he
[31:29] knows when he designed you he knows
[31:31] everything he put inside of you CU
[31:34] inside of you is something that you
[31:35] might not know these a this called
[31:37] predestinated seed of God children if
[31:40] you listen tonight oh my Lord you better
[31:42] listen cuz I'm going to ask you 10
[31:44] questions we go I'm serious amen okay
[31:49] cuz this is for you this is not for the
[31:50] older people they they I'm preaching to
[31:52] the young ones man this is the story of
[31:54] Moses we all should know this shouldn't
[31:56] we okay so so I hope your pencils are
[31:59] sharp and you're on it cuz it's coming
[32:02] so he's asking God to help him but God
[32:05] has Place something in Moses that Moses
[32:09] don't know it's there yet so remember
[32:12] he's only and we're going to go a little
[32:13] bit
[32:14] forward he comes and and he is a type of
[32:18] Christ so what if you if you think about
[32:20] it it really dve Tales night when was
[32:22] Moses born when they were persecuting
[32:26] the babies when when was Jesus born when
[32:29] they were under
[32:31] persecution Jesus was born to be a
[32:33] prophet Moses was born to be a prophet
[32:36] you see there's types coming out here
[32:38] Moses was to be a deliverer Jesus was
[32:41] our deliverer you know so it all just
[32:44] the Bible scripture just Dove Tales it
[32:47] just works out and um there's a couple
[32:50] more he was the
[32:53] lawgiver Jesus was on Earth and he took
[32:55] and he took magnified the law and he
[32:57] says even if you look at your brother
[32:58] with anger yeah then you have committed
[33:01] murder don't do those things you look at
[33:03] another woman so he came and magnified
[33:05] the Lord but Moses brought the law so
[33:07] it's such a beautiful time so you can
[33:09] see God in every life in in in every
[33:12] life of a Christian you can see it these
[33:13] are not stories this is God displaying
[33:16] in the Old Testament a shadow of what's
[33:18] going to happen in the New Testament but
[33:19] what's actually happening now as well
[33:22] yeah there's many of things it's not
[33:23] just one layer God is perfected in three
[33:26] yeah okay so remember three is
[33:28] perfection and then he was also to be a
[33:30] leader Christ is our leader cuz he had
[33:33] to lead them through the Wilderness when
[33:35] they needed healing where did they go to
[33:37] God they went to Moses and God said to
[33:40] Moses do it and God Moses would raise up
[33:42] the serpent and there it is they look on
[33:44] the serpent but Moses had to be the
[33:46] healer so see it was such a beautiful
[33:48] type that Moses was to be but Moses
[33:51] didn't know he was that when he was born
[33:54] you know he was a miracle of his day if
[33:56] you really think about it all the other
[33:58] twoyear olds and down they were fed to
[34:01] the the crocodiles correct the Nile
[34:03] crocodiles ugly things man really but
[34:07] Moses made it and not just that he got
[34:10] picked up by Pharaoh's daughter and got
[34:12] raised by the
[34:15] enemy got fat and strong and trained and
[34:18] and everything in the enemy's Camp God
[34:20] knows how to to do things don't you try
[34:23] to figure it out Moses didn't ever think
[34:25] it was going to be in that situation
[34:26] Moses's mother would never think that
[34:28] was going to happen and that she would
[34:31] be able to still have him as a
[34:34] son you know been paid for while he's
[34:37] been fed and then she can go to him and
[34:39] say Hey you know God said he's going to
[34:40] send a deliverer 400 years will be in
[34:43] Egypt well according to our watch we're
[34:45] there and she would tell him all these
[34:47] stories but Moses did not know it but he
[34:50] knew what his mom was telling him it was
[34:52] still just a head knowledge the message
[34:55] is sometimes still just a head knowledge
[34:59] I want you to think about it between the
[35:01] lines it's just another scripture that's
[35:03] been fulfilled and the prophet came and
[35:05] he open some scriptures and we know the
[35:07] mysteries of God and the Seven Seals and
[35:09] the Thunders and they know everything
[35:11] but it's still just the head knowledge
[35:14] so now Moses finds himself still with
[35:16] the head knowledge it hasn't really
[35:19] become Revelation yet so now see before
[35:22] the plagues fell Moses was still in
[35:25] Pharaoh's house and he looks out the
[35:26] window and he and he has a look at the
[35:28] Hebrews and the Hebrews are getting
[35:29] whipped and they're getting beaten and
[35:31] it's going hard it's pretty much like
[35:33] this day today we look around the church
[35:35] and everything is getting a whipping
[35:38] isn't it yeah you know economy is all
[35:41] falling apart everything is going you
[35:42] can see that we can't rely on on this
[35:45] monetary system as Believers this is not
[35:47] our go we have to be on God's monetary
[35:49] system Hallelujah we have to be on God's
[35:51] economy we can't be on the world's
[35:53] economy right now if you're on the
[35:55] world's economy that will fail amen V's
[35:57] economy will not fail there is a place
[35:59] we just as Believers if we stop a little
[36:02] bit and we just have a look around now
[36:04] she will all fail like Isaac showed
[36:05] those graphs it was shocking the debt
[36:07] and everything is just going up
[36:09] somewhere that thing must hit a ceiling
[36:11] oh yes and once it hits the ceiling
[36:13] what's coming
[36:14] down a lot of stuff we can't be then on
[36:17] that system we need to be on God's
[36:19] systemen so it's the same with the
[36:21] message you can't just understand the
[36:23] message as a head knowledge you can't
[36:25] just just think I'll figure out what
[36:27] brother brandom said and I know what he
[36:28] said and I know all the quotes and I
[36:30] know all this stuff but it's it hasn't
[36:32] become tangible or Revelation to you yet
[36:35] it's still just a message and you still
[36:37] refer it to it as a
[36:39] message but it can't stay a message it
[36:42] has to put on flesh it has to manifest
[36:46] in someone but the more you read the
[36:49] message and the more you try to push it
[36:50] and here the further you'll walk away
[36:52] from God because you're still putting it
[36:54] into a intellect you're not putting it
[36:56] into a life Lord you can listen to all
[36:59] the sermons of brother Brandon non-stop
[37:02] play audio like people that do chain
[37:04] smoking they light one after the other
[37:06] of the other after the other if I can
[37:08] just break this habit it can become a
[37:10] habit I come home I put on a tape I
[37:13] don't even hear what he's saying I come
[37:15] back oh there's a nice point and make a
[37:16] quote and because I can use that one day
[37:18] and it still hasn't put on
[37:20] flesh but see God knows what he's placed
[37:23] in this message God knows what he's
[37:24] placed in the messenger he wants you to
[37:27] dis playay what this message can do but
[37:30] now what happens is he's going to put
[37:32] Moses through some test so of course
[37:34] Moses gets to the first Egyptian and he
[37:37] sees how he handles it and he's having a
[37:38] bit of a conversation pots the guy guy's
[37:40] dead buries him and all of a sudden he's
[37:42] running for his life yeah because he
[37:45] wanted to deliver Israel his way yeah he
[37:48] knew who he was he was told who his was
[37:51] he was identified that it was a peculiar
[37:53] birth his mom told him you would be that
[37:56] Mighty hand that will deliver us
[37:58] he just didn't know the how he said the
[38:00] message is true he just didn't
[38:02] understand the how and the why and the
[38:04] why me right so God said okay I got you
[38:08] I'm going to put you through a couple of
[38:10] Trials so he gave him an angry wife send
[38:13] him to the desert say could chill out
[38:15] there for a while right and she gave him
[38:18] the beans why are we here I don't want
[38:20] to be here I wanted to be
[38:21] there it's just hard but God's Building
[38:25] character amen amen so who finds it easy
[38:29] when it's easy it's good oh but when
[38:32] it's hard it's when you dig for
[38:34] character yeah you go God why me why now
[38:38] you know why always me why now why again
[38:41] why not you you you're really you're so
[38:44] in fighting with God but you're still
[38:46] not walking in Revelation you're still
[38:48] only fighting you're still only in the
[38:50] top four inches where the battle is but
[38:53] we haven't really stepped out of your
[38:55] trial so God goes to to Moses and he
[38:58] says to him okay I'm going to meet you
[39:01] in a Burning
[39:02] Bush Moses walks past and he see a bush
[39:05] burn and that bush keeps burning and it
[39:07] keeps burning and it keeps burning and
[39:09] he's like
[39:11] surely still burning a man is still
[39:14] burning there's something about that
[39:16] bush I'll go and see and as he walks
[39:19] there the Lord says take off thy shoes
[39:22] yeah and something comes
[39:24] real before that he was the mighty deliv
[39:27] and now all of a sudden hey bro let's
[39:29] get humble take off your shoes this is
[39:32] Holy Ground Hallelujah now something
[39:34] speaking to him which he can't explain
[39:36] now when the the prophet of God says
[39:38] good morning or good evening friends and
[39:41] he's starting to talk he goes actually's
[39:43] speaking to me how many of us and this
[39:46] is a true testimony listen to a tape and
[39:48] would receive healing while you're
[39:49] listening to a service or Revelation or
[39:52] overcoming or a sin that besets you so
[39:54] much and you're listening to it and all
[39:55] of a sudden is like brother brandom just
[39:57] speaks to you straight away directly
[39:59] only to you and you're like man this is
[40:02] so much perfect timing what's that the
[40:05] tape no it's God getting your attention
[40:08] amen it's God giving you an experience
[40:11] it's God telling you this is not just a
[40:13] letter okay this is life yeah amen so
[40:17] but he has not met God yet he understood
[40:21] God he knew about God he knew where he
[40:23] was he knew his identity as a message
[40:25] believer but he had not not yet that
[40:29] experience so he's still on first
[40:32] base so the pitch is lined up he gets to
[40:35] the base he swings the bat and there's
[40:37] not even a ball coming yet right he
[40:40] doesn't know what he's doing there kids
[40:42] he's still just thinking I know what I'm
[40:44] doing no Revelation but then the pitcher
[40:47] steps up and he throws the first ball
[40:50] and he goes man that was fast I blinked
[40:52] I didn't see it God came on the scene
[40:54] and said Moses I've got a job for you
[40:57] now Moses go okay Lord you got my
[41:00] attention I'm going to be with you now I
[41:03] want you to it's going to this has to
[41:04] take place in all our lives I'm going to
[41:06] be with you I will explain to you I'll
[41:08] I'll show you miracles I'll walk with
[41:10] you but I want you to just do what I
[41:12] tell you to do so now he's a good
[41:14] message believer and he steps in and and
[41:16] as the prophet he walks and he says I
[41:18] want you to go to pharaoh and say Let My
[41:19] People Go and he goes to Pharaoh after
[41:21] he had a heaps of excuses he's Let My
[41:23] People Go whose people is it God's
[41:26] people yeah he just says I will go with
[41:28] you and you speak what I tell you to
[41:30] speak and he speaks it but still he's
[41:33] now working miracles are happening but
[41:35] he's still just walking in the message
[41:38] he's still not is God's with him I want
[41:41] you to understand it but God's not
[41:42] within him yet and God has got something
[41:45] in Moses he wants to display to Moses
[41:47] but Moses is still just following orders
[41:49] which is good but that's not where we
[41:52] ending tonight he wants Moses to realize
[41:56] who he really is so he says whatever you
[41:59] say if I say there's flies there will be
[42:02] flies you just say it I'll bring it I'll
[42:04] vindicate you as a prophet brother
[42:06] brandom came and there was healing
[42:08] revivals and prayer meetings and prayer
[42:10] calls and he would say this is your name
[42:12] and you are healed and thus sayth the
[42:14] Lord and it would happen every time
[42:16] every time and every time he said
[42:18] haven't I done this in the name of the
[42:19] Lord has any of this not come to pass
[42:22] you you stand up right now if it is like
[42:25] this you tell me cuz we need to fix this
[42:27] then nobody ever challenged him amen so
[42:30] God was with him but see even brother
[42:32] brandham had to face some battles in his
[42:34] life to know what he was talking about
[42:38] and same with Moses amen so now Moses
[42:40] walks out and they starting and and and
[42:43] eventually there's 10
[42:45] plagues kids hands up what was the first
[42:47] plague do you
[42:49] know yes blood water into
[42:53] blood so Vindication hey the blood comes
[42:55] water it's great and Pharaoh goes oo
[42:58] good trick okay I believe you but I'm
[43:00] not convinced yet do you know what the
[43:02] second one
[43:03] was yes frog the frogs M waking up with
[43:08] a couple of frogs in your bed that will
[43:10] be a bit uncomfortable but this wasn't
[43:12] like two or three this was hundreds man
[43:14] it was like there was frogs Galore you
[43:16] think frog frogs is bad this is not
[43:18] these type of Crocs there was frogs
[43:21] everywhere and they they slippery and
[43:23] they're disgusting okay who likes frogs
[43:26] no okay and then what was the next one I
[43:29] had to write them down just to make sure
[43:30] I don't lose my time who knows the next
[43:34] one they're irritating those things
[43:36] they're everywhere especially in the
[43:39] summer
[43:42] flies flies and you're like SWAT SWAT no
[43:45] this was not you couldn't miss you just
[43:46] do this and you get like 50 20 hundreds
[43:49] of them it would have been so annoying
[43:50] and still look Pharaoh's heart is still
[43:53] hard Moses sees the signs the Egyptians
[43:55] see the signs the Hebrews see the signs
[43:58] everybody believes the message everybody
[43:59] sees the message everybody criticize the
[44:02] message God vindicates God vindicates
[44:04] still just
[44:05] flies they don't see the hand of God in
[44:07] it yet it still just flies it's not here
[44:09] yet and then he sent the next one he
[44:13] plagues
[44:14] the kettle and the
[44:17] horses and then they die they start
[44:19] dying so now the livestock gets affected
[44:22] not really good the kettle the kettle
[44:25] the kettle and then after that it's hail
[44:28] and then after the hail he had fleas in
[44:29] there as well but then it's the Locust
[44:31] Locust eats up everything destroys it
[44:34] and then it's the darkness yeah and it's
[44:36] the death of the firstborn yeah okay so
[44:38] I just thought i' bring it to you but I
[44:40] want to explain you something Moses and
[44:42] all the Israelites saw every plague yes
[44:46] was part of it all correct yes now they
[44:50] walk out of
[44:51] Egypt and as they walk God says to Moses
[44:54] I want you to take them to a certain
[44:56] place where there's a lot of water in
[44:57] front of you and a mountain to your Loft
[45:01] and guess what behind you is going to be
[45:03] the Egyptians yeah now remember all
[45:06] these Miracles just happen every tape I
[45:08] listen to I hear God come down every
[45:11] every time brother brandom speaks I go
[45:13] man no man speaks like this but it still
[45:16] has not anchored anywhere inside here
[45:19] because you first have to meet him you
[45:21] have to have that experience Hallelujah
[45:24] so see they get to the the the the sea
[45:26] and here they in front of it and they
[45:28] look behind them and there's a big
[45:29] mountain and they look here and here
[45:30] comes the Army and now they start crying
[45:33] yeah and God says you don't have it yet
[45:36] you don't have it yet because you're
[45:38] still you're still crying you're still
[45:41] fear you're still worry about tomorrow I
[45:44] hold tomorrow and he says to him why C I
[45:48] speak just take your Rod lift it up walk
[45:50] through speak it will be dry ground and
[45:52] so he goes through but the story doesn't
[45:54] end there now Moses gets through on the
[45:57] other side and then what happens is when
[46:00] he gets to the other
[46:02] side and it's me very he he gets there
[46:05] and they see the wonderful things that
[46:07] God has done and it's like that cycle
[46:09] just keeps
[46:12] repeating just keeps repeating after
[46:16] everything but see when God saw Moses he
[46:20] knew that there was more in Moses that
[46:22] he put there and that's why he said to
[46:24] Moses I want you to speak
[46:27] your outcome amen I don't want you to
[46:30] cry I want you to realize that you are a
[46:33] son of God Amen and that you have a
[46:35] position and authority over your enemy
[46:38] over your trial over everything that you
[46:40] do there is a place for you when I
[46:43] anoint you and I bring you up there's a
[46:45] place for you I won't be long tonight
[46:47] kids just hang in there we'll get there
[46:50] and every other believer in the Bible he
[46:52] does exactly the
[46:54] same but see he had to meet God in the
[46:57] burning bush himself before he really
[47:00] knew who he
[47:01] was because before then he was just a
[47:04] prophet living out a tide if you don't
[47:07] meet God
[47:09] yourself this message will always just
[47:11] be a bunch of written quotes dos and
[47:17] doubts it's the long and short of it you
[47:21] young men you want to pray for a wife
[47:23] it's all good brother Bram SE pray for a
[47:24] wife you want to pray for uh uh
[47:26] overcoming over anything or you want to
[47:29] pray for a release on anything you can
[47:30] pray as much as you like but if you know
[47:33] God yeah if you really know him
[47:36] intimately know God and you struggling
[47:38] with addiction or anything that is sin
[47:40] that's besetting you you got authority
[47:43] to speak but I want you to realize you
[47:46] need to meet him first amen hallelujah
[47:49] there must be a experience with God that
[47:52] anchors in that I know that I know that
[47:54] this what I'm talking about is real
[47:58] and this force behind me is not just a
[48:00] hope so or a little promise in the Bible
[48:02] but it's thus sayith the Lord because he
[48:05] says he says I am the vine and you are
[48:08] the branches that meaning God wants you
[48:11] to realize that I can live completely
[48:13] through you I can take every burden away
[48:16] I can break everything off your life I
[48:19] want to use you to do it amen I'll be
[48:22] the force behind you pushing you Just
[48:25] Surrender but I need you to show up for
[48:28] the battle so Joshua we're going a
[48:30] little bit ahead he was under the
[48:31] ministry of Moses and now he comes and
[48:34] he is now standing there before
[48:37] Jericho and it's the same he saw all the
[48:39] Miracles he is a Believer a devout man
[48:42] really good believer but he needs that
[48:44] confirmation he needs that experience
[48:47] God you got this and you are there and
[48:49] the captain of the host shows
[48:51] up when he looks at The Impossible God
[48:54] comes on the scene and he has a meeting
[48:57] oneon-one with God and he talks to God
[48:59] and he says to that captain of host are
[49:02] you for us or against us he says I come
[49:03] to take over this is my show this is not
[49:06] you this is my show I stepped into this
[49:09] burden now I stepped into this trial now
[49:11] I've stepped into what you can't
[49:13] overcome it is real I'm here now but I
[49:16] want your hands and feet yeah come on
[49:19] Joshua I want your hands and feet
[49:22] because if I'm going to defeat your
[49:23] enemy I'm going to need you to do it
[49:25] amen I ain't going to fight your battle
[49:27] for you I'll send more forth my angels
[49:29] I'll protect you I'll encamp around them
[49:31] I'll slay a mighty host if I need you
[49:34] can you show up Hallelujah can you show
[49:36] up amen are you ready to show up or are
[49:40] you still just going to say I don't
[49:42] understand it do you want really to meet
[49:45] the end of that enemy do you want to cut
[49:47] off his head I need you to show up and
[49:49] Joshua gets there and he goes to Jericho
[49:52] and the captain of the host gives him
[49:53] the instructions to do he does it
[49:55] exactly as but it hasn't really sunken
[49:58] in yet I'll explain to you something
[50:00] that same Lord comes and he says to him
[50:03] now I've got AI in front of you I want
[50:05] you to destroy them I'll send forth I
[50:08] will destroy them utterly but please
[50:10] just show up to the battle go for the
[50:13] battle so it's rigged Ed brother Ed it's
[50:16] all rigged he gets to the battle it's
[50:18] all rigged AI gets utterly destroyed
[50:20] it's just they just destroy
[50:23] them and and Joshua starts seeing what
[50:26] Listen Hold on God's got this I need to
[50:30] show up because men we've got this AI
[50:33] King you know this this artificial
[50:35] intelligence you know all these computer
[50:38] stuff that's happening now the smart
[50:39] knowledge and everything but God says I
[50:41] got the battle that's it he says so guys
[50:44] I know we're not going to swing much
[50:45] with the sword and you're not going to
[50:46] get that tired but God said put on your
[50:48] full armor go to the battle and wait for
[50:53] orders first guy goes ah everybody go ah
[50:58] and they go and fight and they win the
[50:59] battle not worried God said I've got
[51:02] that but see now what happens is and
[51:05] I'll close with this I'm not long this
[51:06] is easy stay in
[51:08] it now Joshua goes further and he fights
[51:11] the the five
[51:12] Kings they go and they go to gibian and
[51:17] because he made a league with gibian
[51:19] which they tricked him into he now has
[51:22] to keep his word now the five Kings they
[51:25] fight the of I think of their amorites
[51:27] but all the five kings came and they
[51:29] fought now against Joshua but gibian
[51:33] lets Joshua know hey we you need to
[51:35] protect us we got a deal so this is not
[51:38] really his fight yeah God didn't send
[51:40] him
[51:41] there this is not your trial you just
[51:44] happen to find yourself in a trial where
[51:46] everything is spun out of control and
[51:49] course you done something it has a
[51:50] consequence on the consequence on the
[51:51] consequence and you find yourself in
[51:53] this battle and it's actually not where
[51:54] you should be but you're there things
[51:58] are happening your trial is real amen
[52:01] but see Joshua remembers one thing he
[52:04] remembers God saved me
[52:07] when he saved me at Jericho he helped me
[52:10] with AI I'm fighting an enemy the sun's
[52:14] going down I need more time and now what
[52:17] he does is he speaks yes he doesn't go
[52:21] in a corner and praise he's in battle
[52:23] he's fighting a very real thing and he
[52:25] says what instead instead of admitting
[52:27] defeat I'm going to say sun stand still
[52:29] hold your
[52:30] place we need time Moon you go stay over
[52:34] that Valley I need time right now and
[52:37] God knows because he's in his position
[52:39] and he's now spoken anointing was
[52:41] released and guess what the elements
[52:44] Stood
[52:45] Still and they utterly destroyed the
[52:48] enemy Jesus hlu so here's my do you know
[52:52] what force you have because you've come
[52:54] in contact with a living God Amen
[52:57] do you know that this thing called your
[52:59] mouth is the most powerful weapon you
[53:01] could use and all the devil wants to do
[53:04] is keep it
[53:05] quiet right he wants to hinder your
[53:07] prayer life he wants to hinder your
[53:09] children's prayer life your family altar
[53:12] he wants to take the praise out of you
[53:13] he wants to take the joy out of you he
[53:15] wants to take the testimonies out of you
[53:18] but yet this is the most powerful weapon
[53:21] you can go I had enough amen that's it I
[53:23] had
[53:24] enough this stops tonight amen this
[53:27] besetting sin I had enough this I can't
[53:30] overcome I had enough amen this
[53:32] depression I had enough amen you know I
[53:34] had enough I know what's my position I
[53:38] know who's my God I'm going to push back
[53:40] Hallelujah son you stand still he wasn't
[53:43] angry with the son he was busy fighting
[53:46] he just spoke
[53:47] it so I want you to realize us as
[53:50] Christians have such a a powerful weapon
[53:53] called this and we can we can bring life
[53:55] with it
[53:57] and we can bring death with it but life
[54:00] is so much easier to bring if you just
[54:02] surrender to the one that met you that
[54:04] gave you the Holy Spirit and said I will
[54:06] be in you and with you till the day
[54:08] don't you don't think what you're going
[54:10] to say I'll put the words in your mouth
[54:12] amen but be prepared to speak it and
[54:15] believe it because as God said he says
[54:17] if you say to this mountain to be moved
[54:19] removed into the sea and believe it yeah
[54:23] you can have it amen so challenge is not
[54:27] just to speak but to speak and beli amen
[54:30] and God will come behind that and back
[54:32] it up and that was the same with Moses
[54:34] it was the same with Joshua it was the
[54:36] same with Daniel it was the same with
[54:38] sedra mesach and
[54:40] abedo he he'll Deliver Us he can it was
[54:44] the same with all the Believers there
[54:45] was no doubt so the situation that goes
[54:48] into your carnal flesh shouldn't be
[54:50] affecting what's coming out of your
[54:51] mouth this should this should be the
[54:53] opposite you would go okay this is hell
[54:56] for I'm going through it but blessed be
[54:58] the name of the Lord I will win I will
[55:00] overcome amen you won't get it I will
[55:05] overcome praise the lord it's done but
[55:07] the thing is we choose the low ground
[55:09] and we try to reason this thing out and
[55:11] work it out and how's it going to work
[55:12] and how's tomorrow going to work and is
[55:14] it going to do and this and you got all
[55:16] this going on the women they got lots of
[55:18] that going on men's pretty
[55:20] much but it's still going like that but
[55:22] just that way women go that way and
[55:26] woman man but the thing is God don't
[55:29] want you to think about it God wants you
[55:31] to speak what he says and believe it and
[55:35] move
[55:36] onu that's it brother maram that's it
[55:40] because the battle has showed up on your
[55:41] doorstep he's just asking you Joshua
[55:44] what are you going to do yeah I want
[55:47] king of AI I want that guy's head yeah I
[55:50] want depression's head I want I want
[55:52] whatever is killing you sister Vanessa
[55:54] everything that's that's here on the
[55:56] heart I want it but I want you to use
[55:59] your sword I want you to use your word I
[56:01] want you to speak it believe it receive
[56:03] it and walk on I don't want you to
[56:06] display I'm a a a defeated God I want to
[56:08] display myself through you I am the vine
[56:12] can you surrender speak and move forward
[56:15] and that's how Joshua Wan the campaign
[56:18] the moment they started reasoning that's
[56:20] when the achens happen the moment they
[56:23] started thinking on their own way that's
[56:25] when the trouble goes wrong but if you
[56:26] can just speak and believe and walk
[56:29] God's got it amen don't worry Hallelujah
[56:31] he's got it he could bring them he can
[56:33] let walls fall he can help you amen
[56:37] there is nothing too great for God amen
[56:41] amen I mean I I'll give you a testimony
[56:43] and I'll I'll close with that it's not a
[56:45] big one
[56:47] tonight I started a
[56:50] business and when I started a business I
[56:53] had to learn to surrender fully
[56:56] every second of every day because boy
[57:01] when the devil climbs in man he's
[57:03] punching left right and Senter telling
[57:05] me everything I cannot do and continuing
[57:07] he's pouring it on he just comes and
[57:10] comes and comes until God said what are
[57:12] you going to do about it I say hey
[57:13] tomorrow will be a good day blessed be
[57:15] the name of the Lord you have no work
[57:17] for the whole week praise the Lord he
[57:19] wants me to do something else I had to
[57:22] physically speak it and say well if I
[57:24] don't have a work for that then I'm
[57:25] going to do something something for the
[57:26] Lord or I'll I'll work on his business
[57:29] because it's his place and I I started
[57:30] changing the way I
[57:33] speak I want you to realize to reflect
[57:36] his
[57:37] word not to reflect my feelings Amen to
[57:41] reflect this every promise he gave
[57:44] me Hallelujah he's taken so much time to
[57:47] write this book and give it to us and
[57:49] yet we can't take one of the promises
[57:51] and say hey that's for me but we want to
[57:53] argue and fuss and worry and he goes
[57:55] yeah but it's written yeah there it's
[57:57] written yeah I've got the plans for you
[58:00] plans to prosper plans to do good to be
[58:02] healthy I want you to succeed you're my
[58:04] son you display me I want you to go
[58:07] forth and and Conquer that thing but we
[58:09] don't take the time to stand on this no
[58:11] we reason oh man and we can reason so I
[58:15] want to encourage you if you feel
[58:17] yourself outweighed and and you feel
[58:19] really that that this has become a dead
[58:22] letter you haven't met the Living God
[58:26] I want to say it again I feel really
[58:28] inspired saying that if this is a dead
[58:30] letter you haven't met the Living God
[58:32] that wrote this because for him
[58:35] nothing's impossible amen and every
[58:38] story that people thinks is a story is
[58:40] actually a real life
[58:44] testimony he brother
[58:47] Jimmy every life in here is a testimony
[58:49] it's not a story if you make it a story
[58:51] you make the letter dead yeah right you
[58:53] tell God he tells stories he doesn't
[58:55] tell stories tell the truth huj so
[58:57] everything written in here I believe it
[58:59] if it worked for Daniel works for me if
[59:02] it worked for Cedric M it works for me
[59:04] the thing is if I can accept this then
[59:07] he's going to come on the scene and says
[59:08] you know this one you always wanted to
[59:10] meet when they say the Rapture is on and
[59:12] there's a a calling away and you're
[59:13] going to meet this I'm going you're
[59:15] going to meet me amen my dad was was so
[59:19] challenged on this I called God I talked
[59:22] to God and he knows I share this
[59:23] testimony a lot I want that phone that
[59:25] when people said I spoke to God I want
[59:27] that phone brother Ben is a witness
[59:29] we've got witnesses here yes sir he says
[59:31] with the sincerity of heart he says I
[59:32] want to talk to that God and a little
[59:35] two-year-old girl girl spoke to him he
[59:37] said God just spoke to me through a
[59:39] 2-year-old girl his very thing that he
[59:42] was looking for God says I'll answer but
[59:44] I won't answer it in your way I'll
[59:46] answer it in my way and when he
[59:48] identified this was God working through
[59:50] a 2-year-old that didn't say one word
[59:53] yeah but spoke the world and changed his
[59:55] life
[59:56] forever change his life forever so you
[1:00:00] don't need to figure out how the
[1:00:01] battle's going to go just take the
[1:00:03] Living God with you speak the word and
[1:00:05] work forward don't figure it out it's
[1:00:08] not your job this is not your battle
[1:00:11] he's the vine you're the branches just
[1:00:13] reflect what he's telling you don't
[1:00:16] forget that hallelujah amen the Lord
[1:00:18] amen that's it that's our service
[1:00:20] tonight don't forget who's with you but

[1:00:24] work he will push you just go fruit
[1:00:28] fruit fruit fruit amen hallelujah fruit

[1:00:37] you ask and this is where brother Ed and
[1:00:39] I had like a juice some people's trials
[1:00:42] are hard I understand it some people are
[1:00:47] in offices where God wants to really
[1:00:49] make them understand the burden of the
[1:00:51] people underneath them pray for our
[1:00:53] deacons pray for our pastor
[1:00:56] these people have different fights than
[1:00:58] we have here I promise you trust me I
[1:01:01] know I've seen it I've got one as the
[1:01:04] best friend I have that knows me the

[1:01:09] okay but when the trials hit them it
[1:01:12] gives them a sincere heart for all of us
