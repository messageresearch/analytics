[35:39] lord for them tonight with that demon
[35:41] that has been sitting there hindering
[35:43] them for all those years lord those
[35:45] those um lord
[35:47] those jebusites and those amorites and
[35:49] all those
[35:50] the the the the canaanites lord and all
[35:53] those little things that's just in our
[35:55] lives lords that bugs us

[35:59] that in the name of our lord jesus

[36:11] amen
[36:13] amen
[36:14] hallelujah
[36:16] it is wednesday night saints
[36:19] it is wednesday night
[36:21] and uh we've come here to war
[36:24] and you know what the lord has already
[36:27] set the stage musicians thank you very
[36:29] much god bless you he's already have
[36:31] this battle
[36:33] we just need to show up so i want to
[36:35] encourage you
[36:36] it's already been set this meeting for
[36:39] all of us
[36:41] so just get your blessing out of us
[36:43] tonight
[36:44] amen um brother ed can you put me off
[36:47] the foldbacks if it's possible if i am
[36:50] on there
[36:51] i just don't like hearing my own voice
[36:53] sometimes
[36:54] amen i want you to turn to second
[36:57] corinthians six now if there's ever been
[36:59] a service that i am
[37:01] so not prepared for us tonight i i have
[37:04] a thought and i've spent time in the
[37:06] word and i've spent time in prayer and
[37:08] i've asked the lord to show me and i've
[37:09] got all these things that i put down but
[37:11] i actually
[37:13] don't quite know how it's going to end
[37:16] so that makes it open for him to come
[37:17] and confirm it so anything is possible
[37:20] because all that is coming over the
[37:22] pulpit has already been confirmed if we
[37:23] look at the songs
[37:25] that the voice
[37:27] is spoken so many times
[37:29] that voice that went forth
[37:31] has so many times that cover over this
[37:33] pulpit but tonight more than ever the
[37:35] songs the voice of my beloved brother it
[37:37] says we listen to that voice the voice
[37:39] behind the voice there's so much going
[37:41] on and we kind of forget to listen to
[37:44] that voice
[37:45] because there's so many voices out there
[37:48] so i encourage you shut those voices out
[37:51] shut them out right now and hear his
[37:53] voice
[37:54] all those things that confuse you all
[37:56] those things that everybody's man's
[37:58] opinion and all those things just shut
[37:59] it out for five seconds
[38:01] and let that voice our lord jesus christ
[38:04] speak to you tonight i encourage you
[38:06] it's not a long sermon it's very very
[38:08] nice and short i pray it will just flow
[38:11] and everything would work out for the
[38:13] greater good of god
[38:15] but my service and all i can really say
[38:17] is is his voice so 2 corinthians 6
[38:22] and we go to verse 16
[38:26] and he says
[38:28] and what argument have the temple of god
[38:31] with idols
[38:33] for ye are the temple of the living god
[38:36] and god hath said i will dwell in them
[38:40] and walk in them
[38:41] and i will be their god and they shall
[38:44] be my people
[38:46] wherefore come out of among them and be
[38:49] ye separated say of the lord and touch
[38:52] not the unclean thing and i will receive
[38:55] you
[38:56] amen and i repeat that and i will
[38:59] receive you and all that the father has
[39:02] given me shall come
[39:03] amen he says and will the father unto
[39:07] you
[39:08] and will be a father unto you and you
[39:10] shall be my sons and daughters save the
[39:12] lord almighty amen let's just just pray
[39:15] again
[39:16] lord jesus we have read the scripture we
[39:19] invite you now to come just here in
[39:21] between us lord and fellowship with us
[39:24] and lord whatever your word set out to
[39:26] accomplish tonight may be accomplished
[39:28] here in our meds lord and even the
[39:30] brothers and sisters that can't be here
[39:31] tonight lord i encourage lord that you
[39:33] would just
[39:34] just touch them as well may that voice
[39:36] speak just as loud to them tonight as to
[39:38] us all i pray in the name of our lord
[39:40] jesus christ amen
[39:43] you can have your seed saints
[39:45] amen
[39:47] um if we can get that slight show up
[39:49] please brother ben
[39:51] um
[39:52] can i turn that just give me a sec
[39:56] amen
[39:58] um
[39:59] so i'll tell you just a little bit
[40:01] behind it is i tried to teach my son
[40:04] meths this week
[40:08] hey ruben how did it go
[40:14] because
[40:16] what i forgot is he doesn't know all the
[40:18] rules he doesn't know that all the ins
[40:20] and outs and he's asking about the 12
[40:22] times table and say i'm struggling a
[40:24] little bit with it and of course me
[40:26] being dead and and want to know
[40:28] everything about maths and i'm not that
[40:30] clever with math don't test me tonight
[40:32] please
[40:36] but i figured out some shortcuts that
[40:37] the teachers used to teach us but i
[40:39] forgot that he doesn't know them
[40:41] and so i'm starting with the 12 times 4
[40:43] and it went to 18 times 6 and then it
[40:46] goes to 24 times 5 and man i'm just on
[40:48] the move and then it went to 123 times
[40:50] five and then it went a thousand two
[40:52] hundred and forty eight times six and i
[40:54] look back at the room and that guy's
[40:56] lost
[40:57] but you can see it on his face it's like
[40:59] some people when people preach at them
[41:01] and they look at you and they just like
[41:04] but they do because they you for that
[41:06] moment they briefly stepped out of the
[41:08] room and you missed it
[41:10] so i encourage you i do not want to come
[41:13] and give a maps lesson but don't you
[41:15] step out of the room and miss it tonight
[41:17] amen
[41:18] but it taught me one thing
[41:20] sometimes when you think you know a lot
[41:23] it's not always good because it's how it
[41:26] is revealed to the young man which makes
[41:29] it sits in there so i ask that the lord
[41:31] will reveal it tonight to you
[41:33] there is a reason for my shoes
[41:35] and i'll explain that as well
[41:38] it's me one of those weeks
[41:40] man satan was busy but i thought if i
[41:43] have these shoes and i can kick him out
[41:44] in the face okay
[41:46] because i i took my suit to work and i
[41:48] took my shoes to work and everything is
[41:50] still at work
[41:52] and i drove all the way to church and i
[41:53] showed up and just before i got to
[41:55] church i went what am i wearing
[41:58] and it's not here so i phoned my wife
[41:59] and thanked the lord she hasn't left the
[42:01] house yet but i only have the one period
[42:03] to choose so i thought hey let's put the
[42:05] biggest ones on because if you're going
[42:07] to step on your enemy and it's under
[42:08] your feet it might as well just hurt all
[42:10] right
[42:11] come on amen and that's why we're for
[42:13] real life christians
[42:15] there's nothing different to us we are
[42:17] just real-life people that love god and
[42:20] walk and no matter what we do god always
[42:23] has a little lesson in everything don't
[42:25] miss this children
[42:28] don't miss this god has a lesson in
[42:30] everything amen so let's let's jump into
[42:33] this
[42:34] who is leading you
[42:36] so my question is brother onyas preached
[42:39] about faith and how you can ask anything
[42:42] he can ask the jumbo jet you don't even
[42:45] have to worry about the hangar it's
[42:46] already sorted it's true
[42:49] you can ask he says would you ask in my
[42:51] name okay because the name of the lord
[42:53] has power and the world tapped into it
[42:55] and brother isaac preached on it one day
[42:57] no ye not you are gods
[42:59] and it's stuck in my head that we can
[43:01] actually speak and if we have faith we
[43:04] can re receive that that's why you have
[43:06] football stars that way of rugby stars
[43:08] but the thing is they give themselves to
[43:10] their hearts desire they don't give
[43:12] themselves to god first they give
[43:14] themselves to their hearts desire and
[43:16] that
[43:17] manifests because they have faith and
[43:19] they believe and they receive
[43:22] and they eat and sleep and drink and eat
[43:25] and sleep and drink and eat and sleep
[43:26] and drink all that desire that they have
[43:29] and that's the only thing they focus on
[43:31] but they miss the living god
[43:33] and they get what they want
[43:35] and we look at them and we go by why can
[43:38] they get that and i ask for healing and
[43:40] i don't get healing
[43:44] come on
[43:45] am i just preaching about myself i look
[43:47] at people i go he gets everything and he
[43:49] gets blessed and she gets blessed
[43:51] where's my blessing
[43:52] and i'm not saying the lord's not
[43:54] blessing me but sometimes we think in
[43:55] this little space and we forget that god
[43:58] works in all the other space but we're
[44:00] only here
[44:01] so so i want you to encourage them when
[44:03] you look at another christian or when
[44:05] you look at another fellowship or when
[44:06] you look at another brother or sister or
[44:08] anyone
[44:09] don't want what he wants because that's
[44:12] not for you
[44:14] amen not for you
[44:16] you are you and god made you thus
[44:18] because he wants to use you now i'm
[44:20] totally not on my notes but amen praise
[44:23] the lord
[44:24] so another thing because i wasn't
[44:26] prepared i didn't bring my charger for
[44:28] my tablet and that went flat so i don't
[44:30] even have my sub notes so i absolutely
[44:33] just trust in the lord tonight and he's
[44:36] just humbling me every day amen so we're
[44:38] going to exodus and exodus 23
[44:42] now i want you to follow me because
[44:45] brother ed said about that voice and
[44:47] when he spoke about that voice i asked
[44:48] the lord how is this sermon going to tie
[44:51] in because i don't actually know why i
[44:54] have all these notes in order but
[44:56] they're not quite fitting
[44:58] and when everyone said it is that voice
[45:00] behind the voice it struck home and i
[45:04] said thank you lord
[45:06] because if you would ever know and
[45:07] brother ben and brother mumpo when you
[45:09] stand here and you don't quite know
[45:11] where it's going to go you need
[45:12] confirmation because the last thing i
[45:14] want to do is say something that would
[45:16] rebuke or anything against the lord and
[45:18] be held accountable for it so i
[45:20] encouraged you if you're tired stand up
[45:24] shake it out
[45:25] just stay here
[45:27] don't leave
[45:28] amen
[45:29] so now now god comes down oh moses comes
[45:33] down and god just spoke to moses he gave
[45:35] him an exodus tweet he gave him the team
[45:36] commandments and now he's going to tell
[45:38] him how to sacrifice before this and
[45:40] he's going to tell him how he wants his
[45:42] offerings and he's going to set a couple
[45:44] of things in order but i want you to see
[45:46] god is busy speaking to moses
[45:50] i want you to repeat this god is
[45:52] speaking to moses
[45:55] let's say it again god is speaking to
[45:58] moses amen so god is busy having a
[46:01] conversation with moses and he tells him
[46:04] this and this is why it's so important
[46:06] that we catch this
[46:07] he says behold i send an angel before
[46:10] thee
[46:12] now why would god want to send the angel
[46:14] before moses if god is first person
[46:16] speaking to him why don't you just say i
[46:18] go out before thee
[46:20] why would god say to moses a messenger
[46:23] angel is so important
[46:26] why would he say it if god is now having
[46:27] a first-person conversation to the
[46:29] prophet and telling him what he should
[46:31] do and how he should set the church in
[46:33] order and worship and all those things
[46:35] and burnt offerings and everything he
[46:36] says but i sent an angel before thee
[46:40] now who is this angel
[46:44] have you thought about it because
[46:45] sometimes we read the scripture but we
[46:46] forget what is the importance of what
[46:48] god just said because he could have said
[46:50] to moses right there said don't worry
[46:52] i'm just going to go before you
[46:54] and we miss it because this is what now
[46:57] the the the nominations for and they
[46:59] start cutting god up
[47:00] into into 15 different people and 20
[47:04] different people and he's one
[47:06] but he's got a purpose for this behold i
[47:08] send an angel before thee
[47:10] and he says to keep thee in the way
[47:14] and to bring thee into a place which i
[47:16] have prepared
[47:19] so he says to you i'm sending you an
[47:21] angel i'm giving you the law i'm telling
[47:23] you what i want but i'm going to send
[47:24] you a messenger and this messenger is
[47:27] going to keep you in the right way
[47:30] and there's a reason for it because why
[47:32] did ma why did god choose man to preach
[47:34] the gospel
[47:38] so he says beware of him and obey his
[47:41] voice
[47:44] now there's an instruction he says i'm
[47:46] sending you a messenger this message has
[47:48] got a messenger is going to come with a
[47:49] message that message will keep you in
[47:51] the way as long as you obey his voice
[47:56] provoke him not
[47:58] for he will not pardon your
[47:59] transgression for my name is in him
[48:02] because remember that time they were
[48:03] still under the blood of bulls and goats
[48:07] he says
[48:08] but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[48:11] and do all that i speak so who's
[48:13] speaking through this angel
[48:16] so is it the angel just speaking or has
[48:18] he surrendered himself
[48:20] and god sent the man on the earth and
[48:22] said i'm going to speak through this
[48:23] vessel and i will tell you the way obey
[48:26] that voice because god if you look a
[48:29] little bit back there when when moses
[48:31] was on mount sinai and it was the
[48:33] thunderings and the and the storms and
[48:35] everything what did the israelites tell
[48:37] him
[48:38] say we don't want to go up there
[48:41] you go up we scared we going to go back
[48:44] we we can't face god
[48:46] he's too great for us we're scared
[48:49] so god saw i need to do a different veil
[48:52] to send the message so that people would
[48:54] receive that message
[48:57] because god is sovereign god is almighty
[49:01] and and why does the angel say when they
[49:04] appear to the people fear not
[49:06] because it is something that if you
[49:08] would be sitting right here and an angel
[49:10] would pop right next to you right now
[49:12] you would get a fright
[49:14] and the sight of an angel isn't just a
[49:16] man in a white robe
[49:17] because why did he have to tell every
[49:19] single one he visited fear not
[49:22] and everyone he visited from mary to
[49:24] every preacher to every to every pole
[49:27] and soul and everything when they struck
[49:29] them down it is it is a mighty thing
[49:31] that they would respond my lord
[49:35] so sometimes we get a bit confused with
[49:37] this old doctrine about who's the angel
[49:39] and who's god and who's that it is god
[49:43] he just appears in a different form
[49:46] because god started the plan of
[49:47] redemption god is busy finishing the
[49:50] plan of redemption and that is what
[49:51] god's job to do
[49:54] so again in this season i'll finish
[49:57] there because i'm leaving this notes now
[49:58] but in this season in this seventh
[50:00] church eight god once more send the
[50:02] messenger
[50:04] amen
[50:05] and that messenger is there to prepare a
[50:07] way to a expected end
[50:10] he says to a place which i have prepared
[50:16] so when we look at this message of an
[50:18] hour and we look at brother branham and
[50:20] we look at all the things that happens
[50:22] it's nice to hear the prayer lines it's
[50:23] nice to see the miracles it's nice to
[50:25] hear someone being touched and and got
[50:27] their healing but what about here
[50:30] because the angel's voice is still here
[50:34] the angels is still leading us
[50:36] we are surrendered to christ we believe
[50:38] in jesus christ that's fine god was
[50:41] speaking to moses
[50:43] god was speaking to moses
[50:46] moses didn't stop believing in god
[50:49] but he had to hearken unto the voice of
[50:50] the angel
[50:53] do you get it
[50:54] it is not complex there is a person that
[50:57] spoke to no man before i was in the
[51:00] nomination churches
[51:01] and i was sitting there and nobody told
[51:04] me of hell
[51:05] they preached me into hell but they
[51:07] never told me what is the accusers what
[51:10] is the devil's tactics how can i defeat
[51:12] him how can i overcome why i'm here
[51:15] where am i standing in the church i just
[51:17] where am i going where did it all start
[51:20] and where's the greatest battle nobody
[51:22] could tell me what was going on they got
[51:24] all these doctrines and baptized this
[51:26] way and do this and they've got all
[51:27] these men's opinions
[51:29] but when it came to when the rubber hits
[51:31] the road they cannot tell you where you
[51:33] are
[51:34] so now i go to them and i say okay great
[51:36] it's all good i must believe in jesus
[51:38] christ he leads the church
[51:40] good who's malachi 10 who's revelation
[51:43] 10 7 who's malachi 4
[51:46] who's that
[51:47] oh it's a priesthood it's a now the
[51:49] reason amen
[51:51] now the reason
[51:52] but none of that priesthood placed me in
[51:54] the land
[51:55] and joshua placed the people in the land
[51:58] he went and he placed the people in
[52:00] their inheritance and if they didn't
[52:03] listen to joshua they wouldn't have had
[52:05] the mountain
[52:06] yeah
[52:08] if you think about it if caleb didn't
[52:10] trust that that god spoke to joshua and
[52:13] joshua said is we gonna go around the
[52:15] walls of jericho six times
[52:17] go because now he's the mason journey so
[52:19] here comes uh uh joshua he's the prophet
[52:22] and he looks at the walls of jericho and
[52:24] i've said it last time i just want to
[52:25] maybe show you because this is where it
[52:27] started
[52:28] and he looks at the walls of jericho and
[52:29] he is the captain of the host
[52:31] but the captain of the host don't tell
[52:33] him i'm going to go in front of you and
[52:35] i'm going to bash those walls down
[52:37] he didn't do it and when the walls fell
[52:39] down it said nothing about the mighty
[52:41] captain of the host went in and broke
[52:43] all the walls down
[52:45] god did it how god did it i don't know
[52:48] how many angels broke those walls down i
[52:50] don't know
[52:52] but it wasn't the captain of the host
[52:53] the captain of the host said i've come
[52:55] to take over
[52:57] and this is what you'll
[52:58] do and he gave a message
[53:01] now joshua two choices he could have
[53:03] listened to the message or he could have
[53:05] still gone and say i don't know this is
[53:07] gonna work i'm just not gonna go back to
[53:09] israel because you know what if i go
[53:11] back to the hebrew children i tell him
[53:12] this is gonna happen he's going to go
[53:14] are you nuts
[53:16] oh no i don't know maybe it's going to
[53:17] work maybe it's not
[53:19] is that how god works
[53:21] but god knew because he said for moses i
[53:24] will send the angel before you and he
[53:27] will get you there but i want to see
[53:28] something he said for my angel shall go
[53:31] before you and you will bring you into
[53:34] the amorites the hittites the parasites
[53:36] the canaanites the evites and the
[53:37] jebusites
[53:38] okay question did moses face them
[53:44] so what is that
[53:46] that's prophecy
[53:48] and he says moses you might not see it
[53:50] like you see it now but i am prophesying
[53:52] that you will see that battle
[53:55] and i will cut them off
[53:58] because it's now there is a rapture
[54:01] you're going to go in a rapture it's not
[54:03] how i'm going to cut them off it's not
[54:05] when i'm going to cut them off i am
[54:07] going to cut them off
[54:09] it's not how i'm going to make it in the
[54:11] rapture how many truths and yes and amen
[54:13] or whatever i say god is going to make
[54:15] it happen
[54:17] all i need to do is listen to the voice
[54:20] because the voice keeps me in the way
[54:23] i don't i don't throw all this now away
[54:25] because i've got the voice
[54:27] this is all part of that voice
[54:30] moses and god was still one but he still
[54:33] had to get a messenger
[54:36] now why if god worked like that there
[54:38] would he change now
[54:40] if he's yesterday today and forever the
[54:42] same why would he do it now different
[54:45] because if he does it different now he
[54:47] made a mistake back then and then all we
[54:48] have now is just a bunch of
[54:51] confusion
[54:52] that's not my god
[54:56] i want to go on
[54:58] so now we go on to joshua 9
[55:01] and now the wars of jericho has fallen
[55:03] down
[55:04] and now these kings
[55:07] says and and i'm gonna just paraphrase
[55:09] abyss but and it came to possibly all
[55:11] the kings on this side of the jordan in
[55:13] the hills and the valleys and all the
[55:14] coasts in the great tree over against uh
[55:16] lebanon there they are he died emma
[55:18] right canaanite parasite he jebusite
[55:22] prophecy
[55:23] what did they do they gathered
[55:25] themselves together to fight with joshua
[55:29] so now
[55:30] moses didn't see them but now the
[55:32] prophecy is starting to be fulfilled
[55:35] now the voice is coming to pass now
[55:37] joshua after moses told him all these
[55:39] things and he knows he goes into the
[55:41] promised land and god confirmed that he
[55:42] was with josh with moses as he is with
[55:44] joshua now now he knew that still had to
[55:47] be fulfilled so he knew what he was
[55:49] facing we know what time we are standing
[55:52] in we know our enemy we know how evil
[55:54] this world is
[55:56] why do you want to dip your toes in the
[55:58] world
[55:59] [Music]
[56:00] if we've been taught how evil and how
[56:02] deceitful this age is why do you want to
[56:05] go dip your fingers and your toes in the
[56:07] world
[56:08] what do you have there it's not your
[56:10] place it's not your promised land
[56:13] you cannot serve god amen at the same
[56:15] time you cannot have a little bit of the
[56:17] world
[56:18] and a little bit of god amen because
[56:21] what happens then the more you start
[56:23] putting your foot into the world
[56:25] the nicer it becomes
[56:28] and the less you start hearing that
[56:29] little voice
[56:31] and that voice is telling you stay in
[56:32] the word
[56:34] stay with god's word don't mingle with
[56:36] the world i am not making us some
[56:39] holy people that just sit in a word the
[56:41] whole day in reading
[56:42] no way i got a job
[56:45] but i am an ambassador to christ
[56:48] so when the enemy comes over my path and
[56:51] it says something contrary to what the
[56:52] word says i speak out
[56:55] if the enemy goes and does all their
[56:58] filth and all the people of the world go
[57:00] and drink and have parties and do all
[57:01] those things i don't take part of it
[57:03] because that's not my portion
[57:06] because i heard a voice in the voice
[57:08] said sustain from those things
[57:12] and
[57:14] i will put my spirit within you and you
[57:17] can resist those things
[57:19] because as hard as you don't want to
[57:20] drink as hard as you don't want to smoke
[57:23] as hard as you don't want to swear or
[57:25] curse or do anything like that
[57:27] if god is not doing the finished work in
[57:29] your life
[57:30] if you have not fully surrendered and
[57:32] said lord i cannot fight this battle he
[57:35] cannot take it
[57:37] he cannot take it
[57:41] amen so i just wanted to show you
[57:44] and that's where my notes went missing
[57:46] um
[57:47] i just want to show you that here comes
[57:50] here comes the prophet
[57:52] and he's speaking and he says good
[57:53] morning friends
[57:55] and he's busy talking to a congregation
[58:00] and
[58:01] i put on the tape and i listen to it
[58:04] and he starts talking about redemption
[58:07] by the blood of jesus christ about
[58:09] justification
[58:10] sanctification
[58:12] filling off the holy ghost
[58:14] a lot of people spoke about it
[58:16] and then the tape i listened to he says
[58:19] he was there
[58:21] and he was in india
[58:23] and
[58:24] i don't know why i'm sharing this but
[58:25] here he comes and he looks at the
[58:27] muhammadans
[58:29] and there's a blind man on the platform
[58:31] but god showed him a vision
[58:34] and he says to all of them and i'm
[58:36] paraphrasing because i can't remember it
[58:38] word for word and he says to him
[58:40] if your gods that you boast so much
[58:42] about
[58:44] he's god
[58:46] come up to this platform and give this
[58:48] man his sight he says because not even i
[58:51] can give this man in sight
[58:55] but if my god
[58:58] if my god
[59:00] and this is where the challenge is and
[59:01] this is why we have this message if my
[59:04] living god not a dead denominational god
[59:07] my living god comes here
[59:10] and he gives this man his sight will you
[59:12] give your life to the lord jesus christ
[59:16] not to me
[59:18] to that one that created heavens and
[59:20] earth
[59:21] and he closes his eyes and he prays for
[59:23] the man and he says lord on your vision
[59:25] that you showed me by your command same
[59:28] as that mount carmel experience when
[59:30] they were standing there elijah was
[59:32] standing the fruit in front of the bold
[59:34] prophets
[59:35] he said lord by your doing so by the
[59:38] vision you showed me i say lord grant
[59:40] this man his sight and while he's still
[59:42] praying that man shouts out and he runs
[59:44] off the stage
[59:46] now i ask you what has changed
[59:50] when lasted we see miracles
[59:53] every day
[59:56] where are you looking do you want this
[59:58] great awesome sensation we re god just
[1:00:00] do a multi healing or do you want to see
[1:00:03] souls birthed into the kingdom of god
[1:00:06] so have you ever thought your treasures
[1:00:07] that's up in heaven have you ever
[1:00:09] thought what those treasures are
[1:00:11] do you think it's just gold and silver
[1:00:14] because you've been a good steward i'm
[1:00:15] going to give you more gold the more
[1:00:17] silver but the pavement that we walk on
[1:00:19] is gold
[1:00:21] would you ever want to go to and i'm
[1:00:23] going to ask you brother marion
[1:00:25] you work with a lot of people a lot of
[1:00:27] tradies a lot of people
[1:00:30] think about it davey would you want one
[1:00:33] of them to go to hell
[1:00:36] not one
[1:00:40] so what are we doing
[1:00:42] where is the mercy seat of god
[1:00:45] you want to see miracles
[1:00:47] you listen to that voice
[1:00:49] you want to see people safe you listen
[1:00:51] to that voice
[1:00:53] because that voice keeps you in in line
[1:00:55] and in step with god so that god can
[1:00:58] move you to get those ones that goes
[1:01:00] wayward
[1:01:02] you don't need to stand behind the
[1:01:03] pulpit or play instrument to be a
[1:01:05] testimony in this world
[1:01:07] amen don't miss it don't miss it
[1:01:10] children
[1:01:12] don't miss it
[1:01:14] you don't need us to be a superstar
[1:01:16] to give someone eternal life
[1:01:20] is it too hard to say if i say you give
[1:01:22] someone eternal life
[1:01:23] if god's spirit is within you and you
[1:01:25] ministering the word and god draws him
[1:01:28] in that very moment and he reserves
[1:01:29] eternal life
[1:01:31] he receives the lord jesus as his savior
[1:01:36] amen there's a three-room house
[1:01:39] a three-compartment service
[1:01:41] one is your body
[1:01:43] what you do for christ
[1:01:46] one is your body what you do for christ
[1:01:49] not just boris spirit soul and one is a
[1:01:51] fiction so one is emotions the prophet
[1:01:53] says one is your body what you do for
[1:01:55] christ the other is your spirit what you
[1:01:57] think of christ and the other one is
[1:01:59] your soul the faith you have in christ
[1:02:04] this is what you are this is the tribe
[1:02:06] being you are you are not just a body
[1:02:08] that really acts to sickness and sits
[1:02:11] here and when you hit your finger you
[1:02:12] cry like a baby
[1:02:14] your body
[1:02:16] is there for the service of our lord
[1:02:18] jesus christ
[1:02:19] to do the work for him
[1:02:22] he goes on he sees a three-room house
[1:02:24] completely absolutely dedicated to the
[1:02:26] service of our living god justification
[1:02:29] by faith sanctification by the blood the
[1:02:31] filling of the holy ghost entering into
[1:02:32] a place of rest with god he says no
[1:02:35] wonder we have so many backsliding no
[1:02:37] monday wonder we have so many troubles
[1:02:39] in the church today because they don't
[1:02:41] come all the way with god till they
[1:02:44] enter into that place where they are
[1:02:47] dead
[1:02:50] so if you reason is it this way or is it
[1:02:53] that way or is it this and you and you
[1:02:56] fuss and you fight and you push back
[1:02:57] you're getting in god's way
[1:03:00] he goes on to say he says man dies out
[1:03:02] to his own intellectual thinking brother
[1:03:04] you preached it
[1:03:06] unless the seed goes in the ground and
[1:03:08] dies
[1:03:11] years old
[1:03:12] he's angry at the christians
[1:03:15] man the blasphemous people that's
[1:03:18] speaking against against jehovah
[1:03:22] i want you not to miss this saul is
[1:03:24] actually he's a servant of god he serves
[1:03:28] god
[1:03:29] with sincerity
[1:03:31] he's a pharisee and here comes this wild
[1:03:33] bunch of people and they say he's a guy
[1:03:35] called jesus christ and he is lord and
[1:03:37] we must serve him
[1:03:39] and it shakes him to the score and if
[1:03:41] you go to to um
[1:03:44] i'll tell you where it is
[1:03:50] just give me a sec i think i need to
[1:03:52] read this
[1:03:54] x9
[1:03:59] and the first verse he says and saul yet
[1:04:02] breathing yet breathing out of
[1:04:04] threatenings and slaughter against the
[1:04:06] disciples of the lord
[1:04:09] angry man
[1:04:11] because he didn't enter into that place
[1:04:14] he didn't he wasn't there yet he didn't
[1:04:16] die out to his knowledge he didn't die
[1:04:18] out to his doctrines he didn't die out
[1:04:20] took amelia's training and teachings and
[1:04:22] everything he didn't he was serving a
[1:04:25] god but he had no relationship with that
[1:04:27] god amen because if he had a
[1:04:29] relationship with a god god would have
[1:04:31] sent him that angel
[1:04:33] and led him into the way but then
[1:04:35] because god had a plan for him god sent
[1:04:38] an angel himself as a light and struck
[1:04:40] him blind
[1:04:42] but i want you to see god wanted to do
[1:04:44] it that way because if you look like the
[1:04:46] jews were blinded for us
[1:04:50] who was saul
[1:04:52] he was
[1:04:53] jew
[1:04:55] and god by this action where he strikes
[1:04:57] down paul
[1:04:59] a soul he strikes him down and he says
[1:05:02] i've blinded the jews
[1:05:04] you go to that man what was that
[1:05:05] prophet's name
[1:05:07] ananias
[1:05:09] and you get him to pray for you
[1:05:11] and then we'll start walking together
[1:05:13] because you are kicking against me
[1:05:15] you're persecuting me jesus christ not
[1:05:18] people
[1:05:19] and paul at such a moment where he had
[1:05:22] to go three years off the scene to go
[1:05:24] see what actually is going on
[1:05:27] but see he didn't just stop there when
[1:05:29] that voice spoke to him and said you
[1:05:31] know what now
[1:05:33] i'll just leave that experience there
[1:05:36] and i'll just move on
[1:05:37] because i am a pharisee of pharisees he
[1:05:40] had a change he had a different way he
[1:05:42] walked but this man went and seeked what
[1:05:45] was going on
[1:05:47] because he wanted to be very very sure
[1:05:49] this god that he met wasn't just a
[1:05:51] deceiving angel because the bible says
[1:05:54] if any angel preach anything else that
[1:05:57] is in this book let him be accursed
[1:05:59] so paul knew that he can't just trust
[1:06:01] any voice of any angel but that he had
[1:06:03] to throw all their thinking now away and
[1:06:06] go find out who this jesus of nazareth
[1:06:08] was
[1:06:10] so he had to die out to himself
[1:06:12] he says so the man and woman that is
[1:06:14] born of the spirit of god you may even
[1:06:17] be so brilliant intellectually
[1:06:19] but if you what if you are not born
[1:06:21] again your intellectuals has rotten away
[1:06:24] from your thoughts
[1:06:26] you are only and and you hold only to
[1:06:28] christ and he fills you with his holy
[1:06:30] spirit that is when things when this
[1:06:33] world becomes foolish and the love of
[1:06:35] god is in is first in your heart
[1:06:39] so who thinks this world is cool
[1:06:43] come
[1:06:45] huh
[1:06:47] i looked at some eevees the other day
[1:06:49] and i thought man that's so that's
[1:06:51] couple of the we get some clever people
[1:06:52] now
[1:06:53] you know we can put some wi-fi towers in
[1:06:55] the middle of nowhere and elon can beam
[1:06:57] us some some signals and we've got
[1:06:59] google google knows everything
[1:07:02] this world is foolish
[1:07:05] because they left god they left the tree
[1:07:07] of life amen
[1:07:09] and all they have is an intellectual
[1:07:11] thinking
[1:07:12] and they think they're right
[1:07:15] they actually think they're right
[1:07:17] and they think they're serving god
[1:07:19] they miss that
[1:07:23] if you would ask i would say 80 of
[1:07:25] christians out there today where do you
[1:07:27] stand today do you know what time it is
[1:07:30] they would not be able to answer they
[1:07:32] can say or wars and rumors of wars and
[1:07:35] all that they can't place them
[1:07:37] positionally at the seven church eights
[1:07:39] when that final trumpet had that the
[1:07:41] voice of god has spoken they can't do
[1:07:43] that
[1:07:44] gone
[1:07:46] because that voice doesn't speak to them
[1:07:48] but you are that voice
[1:07:51] i didn't know of brother branham when i
[1:07:53] was in south africa and i want to bring
[1:07:54] it and maybe close with this tonight
[1:07:56] because i want us to pray tonight i want
[1:07:58] to sincerely want us to pray
[1:08:00] and ask the lord to help us
[1:08:02] because i think we long lost forgot
[1:08:04] about the purpose of us being here and
[1:08:05] i'm not saying all of us i'm talking
[1:08:07] about
[1:08:08] me these people that need salvation
[1:08:13] these people looking for the holy ghost
[1:08:15] and if we take our feet and we it's too
[1:08:18] much in the world
[1:08:19] god cannot use you
[1:08:21] god cannot use you he is not saying to
[1:08:24] you be a preacher he is saying live a
[1:08:26] life that when somebody is looking for
[1:08:28] god they can see god in you
[1:08:31] not doctrines
[1:08:33] i came here with big boots i went to my
[1:08:36] first church camp was slippers on
[1:08:38] because i didn't have better shoes
[1:08:40] but i was so desperate to hear from god
[1:08:42] that i didn't care what people said
[1:08:44] about my slippers i was still gonna go
[1:08:46] for god what they never knew is that was
[1:08:49] my only pair of good shoes in my
[1:08:50] cupboard
[1:08:52] but i had a desire in me to meet that
[1:08:55] man that all of this people are living
[1:08:58] not speaking about
[1:09:00] living
[1:09:01] because i walked into this church and
[1:09:03] the brother put his arm around me and
[1:09:04] says god bless you let's go fellowship
[1:09:07] by brother benz
[1:09:10] and you know when people started
[1:09:11] receiving us and helping us and doing my
[1:09:14] garden when we was here in stokes valley
[1:09:16] 123 or 24 stokes valley road and we had
[1:09:19] house inspection and i had sisters and
[1:09:21] brothers i never met before and brother
[1:09:22] bendy working in my garden to help me i
[1:09:25] saw this is more than just a gospel yeah
[1:09:29] this is more than just some other
[1:09:30] denomination something touched these
[1:09:32] people and they walk differently
[1:09:36] but if we stop listening to that voice
[1:09:38] if we start feeding on the things of the
[1:09:40] world you are actually doing god
[1:09:44] injustice
[1:09:46] because all he wants is a microphone
[1:09:50] because he sent the messenger to someone
[1:09:52] brother andy was the first messenger i
[1:09:55] received
[1:09:57] and if you receive a messenger in the
[1:09:59] name of a messenger you'll give a
[1:10:01] messenger's reward if you receive a
[1:10:02] prophet in the name of a prophet you'll
[1:10:03] give a prophet's reward
[1:10:05] what do you want
[1:10:07] and as much as i kicked against it the
[1:10:10] life
[1:10:11] that i saw turned me towards this word
[1:10:14] because i was running as far away from
[1:10:16] it as i can
[1:10:18] don't miss that life
[1:10:20] i'm about to close
[1:10:22] jesus said in saint john
[1:10:24] 14 7 the things that ye do or that i do
[1:10:27] ye shall do also
[1:10:29] so why would god
[1:10:31] after he spoke to moses
[1:10:34] said i'll send the messenger then the
[1:10:36] messenger comes i'll messenger brother
[1:10:38] branham he does miracles he does signs
[1:10:41] he does wonders he preached the full
[1:10:43] unadulterated word of god what word what
[1:10:46] god actually wants his heart
[1:10:49] the in-between the line stuff that
[1:10:51] nobody preaches to you
[1:10:53] the why you can't do that not just don't
[1:10:56] do that the why but see what happens is
[1:10:59] people listen to the you can't do that
[1:11:01] and they shot completely down and they
[1:11:03] forgot the why
[1:11:04] because the prophet never came with you
[1:11:06] can't do that don't fall for that the
[1:11:09] prophet came with the why you can't do
[1:11:11] that
[1:11:14] he gives you the why the answer which
[1:11:16] nobody else gives you they just preach
[1:11:19] hell and and and brimstone and all these
[1:11:22] things on fire but they don't tell you
[1:11:24] the why
[1:11:25] all the mysteries that god has in this
[1:11:27] word all his heart has been revealed
[1:11:29] through this ministry of brother branham
[1:11:31] i believe it
[1:11:32] amen and i see god's heart
[1:11:35] and i see there's a reason why do things
[1:11:37] different
[1:11:39] and you know what doesn't bother me
[1:11:42] because i'm sold out to him
[1:11:45] not to brother branham
[1:11:47] to him
[1:11:48] he was just the one that said brother
[1:11:51] branham
[1:11:52] i'm gonna ascend because you're the
[1:11:54] prophet i'm gonna send my voice through
[1:11:55] you
[1:11:56] and i'm gonna speak to this adulterant
[1:11:58] nation which in that time started
[1:12:00] turning walking away from god and that's
[1:12:03] why he had to send the prophet
[1:12:06] and i'm not gonna go into that i think
[1:12:07] we'll do it later on because somebody
[1:12:09] the people forgot why god would send the
[1:12:11] prophet on that specifically that 1933
[1:12:15] with the major visions and before that
[1:12:16] when brother branham started preaching
[1:12:17] they forget the why because the world
[1:12:20] started walking away from god into
[1:12:22] traditions and different beliefs and and
[1:12:25] everybody women can do whatever they
[1:12:27] want and men can be like if they want
[1:12:28] you can smoke drink or whatever and they
[1:12:30] started walking from what god has done
[1:12:33] for them and he said instead of just
[1:12:34] killing them all i'm going to send them
[1:12:36] a voice
[1:12:38] i'm going to send them a messenger a
[1:12:40] angel to keep them in that way
[1:12:44] are you kept in the way
[1:12:46] or are you busy going that way
[1:12:49] i found myself and this is where i would
[1:12:51] maybe close
[1:12:52] but he said these signs and greatest
[1:12:54] things shall we do those greater things
[1:12:57] is not bigger miracles
[1:12:59] our lord jesus calmed the seas
[1:13:02] our lord jesus spoke storms out of
[1:13:03] existence man there was no devil that
[1:13:06] crossed the road of jesus christ and
[1:13:08] that stood
[1:13:09] amen no demon
[1:13:12] we can't do greater than that we can do
[1:13:14] more of that because god and and acts if
[1:13:18] you read it very nicely he came down and
[1:13:20] he and he spread himself into the people
[1:13:22] of the upper room and his tongues of
[1:13:24] fire went and god said now i'm in a
[1:13:25] multi-member body and more than this
[1:13:27] they can do not greater
[1:13:30] we cannot be greater than god god is
[1:13:32] great
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:40] i'll leave it there
[1:13:43] i'll finish with my testimony
[1:13:46] i was not feeling on the word for a
[1:13:49] while because i got too busy with my
[1:13:51] work
[1:13:52] this is me in fellowship
[1:13:54] that's why i want us to pray tonight
[1:13:56] each one of us sincerely
[1:13:58] and i started feeding on more things of
[1:14:00] the world found myself looking too much
[1:14:02] at youtube and
[1:14:04] and every night before i sleep it's just
[1:14:06] a quick
[1:14:07] video about some stupid thing that i
[1:14:10] don't even can remember
[1:14:11] and i found myself starting having
[1:14:13] friction
[1:14:15] starting getting pushing back against
[1:14:17] brothers and sisters and how they either
[1:14:19] enter the church or worship god and all
[1:14:20] those things
[1:14:21] and i thought
[1:14:23] this is not a good place and a bit of
[1:14:24] tension in the house not fights we're
[1:14:27] christians
[1:14:29] but see what happens is i forgot who i
[1:14:32] was yeah
[1:14:33] and for that one moment the world has
[1:14:36] just got me a little bit off the track
[1:14:38] and it kept me busy for a space of six
[1:14:40] months
[1:14:42] six months
[1:14:47] and then the lord said to me what are
[1:14:48] you doing
[1:14:49] brother wayne asked me to share a
[1:14:51] message one day
[1:14:53] and the more i started listening to the
[1:14:55] word again the more i started listening
[1:14:57] to sermons the more i started reading my
[1:14:59] bible the more i spent time in this
[1:15:01] precious word of our lord jesus christ
[1:15:04] my amnesia left me amen
[1:15:08] and i remembered who i was
[1:15:12] don't forget who you are amen
[1:15:16] if you are i encourage you tonight
[1:15:20] let's get back into this word amen amen
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:25] because the world has been designed by
[1:15:27] our enemy
[1:15:28] to deceive us
[1:15:31] to mislead us
[1:15:33] but our god has seen the voice
[1:15:35] in this age
[1:15:37] to keep us in the way
[1:15:40] i encourage you get back to that voice
[1:15:45] if you don't understand it just leave it
[1:15:47] alone
[1:15:48] god will reveal it
[1:15:50] amen
[1:15:51] god
[1:15:52] as i stand here will reveal it
[1:15:57] so let us stand up let us just pray
[1:15:58] together tonight
[1:16:01] amen
[1:16:03] and if you have a need you lift it up to
[1:16:04] the lord i don't need an altar call god
[1:16:07] knows you're here musicians you can come
[1:16:09] up if you want to you don't need to play
[1:16:11] i'll ask you to play but then you can
[1:16:13] pray with
[1:16:14] i'm just encouraging you tonight
[1:16:17] really encouraging tonight
[1:16:19] close your eyes
[1:16:21] take one step back in your life right
[1:16:23] now for the last seven months
[1:16:25] say lord
[1:16:27] search my heart
[1:16:30] lord
