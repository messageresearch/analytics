Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless you brother praise the Lord God bless you all this evening e right and when you're when you're young and as you start to grow you have to start to make choices and what this evening here is about is to try and make is to encourage you to make choices for the Lord when you're at that moment of decision cuz as you get older those those choices become less and less those those by default you don't really reach that place as much when you're older but when you're young you have to start understanding life and why am I here and all these things and I'm just so encouraged by all of you people I want to encourage all of you young people to choose the Lord Jesus over anything else and those of us that have gone down different roads we've learned that that's the best road to go down so um let's just sing a few songs to the Lord and and and as much as we've had fun let's just turn our Focus now to the Lord and and and and get our minds on on spiritual things and and and just let the Holy Ghost come and move in our midst and and speak to us and and minister to our hearts you know it's one thing to be here with each other and have fun but but the Lord really wants to speak to our hearts tonight and and let's just sing some worship songs to the Lord and then we'll ask brother um kadre to come up after that let's sing um someone chose How Great Is Our God as their favorite song and I like that song How Great Is Our God how great is our God how great is his word he's the greatest one that ever was he rode back the Waters of the mighty Red Sea and he said I'm going to lead you won't you follow me one more time How great is our God how great is his [Music] word he's the greatest one that ever was heard he roll back the Waters of the mighty Red Sea and he said I'm going to lead you won't you follow me amen I'm amazed that you love me I'm amazed how you came through your preious blood I found pardon and my sins are was they all washed away all my sins are was away I'm amazed I'm amazed that you love me I'm amazed how you came through your preious blood I found pardon and my sins are washed there all washed away all my sins are let's sing I believe that you love me I believe that you love me I believe that you came through your preious blood I found Parton and my my sins are washed they're all washed away all my sins are washed away and my sins and my sins are washed they all washed away all my sins are wash let's just sing um Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus as brother Cadre comes Turn Your Eyes Upon Jes look for his Wonder Fai and the things of the earth will grow [Music] strange in the light of his glory and grace one more time turn your eyes oh Turn Your Eyes Upon Jes [Music] in his wonderful face and the will grow strange in the of I pledge allegiance that microphone away from your th jacket otherwise it scratches all time [Music] [Music] to with all I am I will to his [Music] command the amen God is good isn't he amen how many have been enjoying themselves amen amen about 10 of you so the rest of you came here to eat huh amen God is so good to us amen who would have ever thought that we can gather in the atmosphere enjoy each other dress up and it be centered around Christ you know a lot of times church and Christianity has been misunderstood there there are dos and don'ts young people but when you fall in love with God it's perceived a different way amen your dos and don'ts is a lifestyle and it's not Grievous to you anymore you know I I can say this because I've been in church and I've been in church without the holy spirit for years sitting there and you know the man of God preaching and I'm like man please will you hurry yeah I got something to do you know and that was my mindset and the word is being preached and I'm not hearing anything because my mind is someplace else right but what I love about God when I got to a place where the way I was doing it wasn't working out and all I could do was turn back around amen and Chase out the God Amen all that word I heard word opened up to me so I want I want to say you may be sitting here you may not understand everything but there's a purpose for you being in church amen because eventually if you hit that right spot that right place all that word is going to come full circle and you're going to be like man I heard that before I heard that before praise God this is this is so good you know but it's it's good to be here and I certainly uh appreciate brother Ben and brother AR for you know inviting me and allowing me to come because you know I'm pretty sure a a lot of y'all know I preach a lot of Youth meetings and different things like that and you know why because I'm one of you I'm one of you guys you know I may I may be a tad bit older I noticed I say tad bit but I'm one of you guys and that's what I love about Joshua's Ministry Joshua the reason why he could take them into the promised land is because he was one of them you know he was there when to when when Moses you know went up the mountain and came back down he was there when people talked about Moses the wrong way and all these things but he stayed with the word Joshua stayed with the word and he was there to hear parents say that oh y'all going to die in the wilderness and our children this and our children that but Joshua was like God gave us a promis amen he gave us a promise and and and no doubt Joshua probably tried to encourage some people encourage some people y'all heard what the prophet said y'all heard what he said come on he said that to us amen he said that to us so I know sometimes you feel like you're not a part of this but you are you're a very big part of it amen a very big part of it but that's my lecture now I'm going to get into going to get into some scripture amen how many ready for the word amen and you look good tonight everyone looks good tonight you know y'all know I'm going preach on that right oh yeah you thought you was going to get by n we going we going to preach on that we going to preach on that um Joshua 24 the Bible the Bible says in Joshua 24 verse verse 14 I hope I'm in a good spot with the mic y'all hear me all right amen I want you to focus in the food was good we going to eat some spiritual food now yeah Joshua 24 verse4 now therefore fear the lord fear the lord fear the lord I wonder how many of you in here fear the lord see what the world what Society is doing they're trying to have a world where there's no Godly fear and you know how they're doing that they're making the world liberal where you can do whatever whatever you want to do and there's no consequences a lot of laws and things that have passed now couldn't have pass years ago because of the fear of God right and when I say the fear of God I'm not talking oh I don't want to go to hell oh I don't want to be amongst demons oh no I'm talking about reverence reverence you reverence God you know what it means to reverence someone you know when I was coming up it was certain things I wouldn't say or do in front of my parents because of reverence yeah but nowadays I don't know about in New Zealand but in the US kids are so disrespectful and they have no reverence no reverence at all they'll tell their parents what they're going to do what they ain't going to do and all these different things you know why because they're making the world liberal and there's no fear there's no Godly fear I I I we would obey our parents because the Bible says honor your parents and you believe that as long as you did that you were okay you were all right and the Bible says that your days may be long upon the land but what society and the world has done is trying to get you guys to live a life without the fear of God the Bible says whatsoever you reap whatsoever you sow you going to reap yeah am that's true I'm here I'm here as a witness to tell you that whatsoever you sow you going to reap amen so let's not take God as some like the prophet of God say some old Doty grandfather let's understand this when God looks at you you know how many of you got parents I hope all of you for those of you who got parents and you know when you stand beside your father if you stand there in front of God he don't see you and your father he see a son and a son right or a son and a daughter or a daughter and a daughter God don't have grandchildren amen amen so it ain't some cycle where you pass certain things down no God deals with you on the same basis as a elected seed amen and you may look at yourself and you may say well brother d I got this going on I got that going on that's what makes God so great amen cuz in the midst of all your trials he can still be God Amen I know him as a deliverer and I and I and I may I may get a little personal for you because I I I I think sometimes y'all young people think you know preachers were born like this just handling the word and praise God and you come out the you come out the womb say th say the Lord your mama said go g honey you hungry you say Amen no we we didn't come out like that amen we didn't come out like that we had to be born again amen we had to get to know the Lord have contact with God you know uhh I can't speak for any other preachers but I made mistakes but God was merciful god was mer first of all cuz there was a desire there even though I was locked I was out there in the world and doing different things in my heart I really wanted to serve God yeah amen amen so let's get that out of your mind no brother digs and whatever preacher you may be looking at as the best preacher in the world he's not Invincible without the grace of God he's just a regular person yeah he's just a sinner amen that's me without the grace of God amen I'm just I'll be sitting in your seat saying Lord I need help yeah amen that's what happens when the grace of God comes your way and you understand it it changes your life and you realize that you're not living on the merits of who you are you're living on the merits of who he is amen you know there's a quote there's a quote and I and I'm I'mma get y'all know I'm just so out of order you know uh uh there's a quote where the prophet of God he he he he he's he's talking about salvation and different things and he talk about he talks about demon powers and all of that he talks about election and and predestination and all these things that's not just for your parents that's for you too amen you're elected you're predestinated amen but you got to get to a place till you know it yeah amen um where was I verse 14 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth see that's what that's how you serve God sincere and truth you know the prophet God talk about you know in different countries the women would take their babies and throw them into the to the Alligators or whatever as a sacrifice they were very sincere but that wasn't truth and by God's grace he's giving us truth it's time for us to get sincere now let let me let me let me drop a bum on you for a second right quick you remember the prophet of God the Lord was uh and and some of you may have never read this but you probably have heard it if you was anything like I was you've heard about the prophet heard about the prophet and you heard the quotes and heard the Cru and all these things but you never took the time to go look for it yourself y'all afraid to say Amen don't turn me into a blood hounding here tonight start sniffing but you know uh just like hearing hearing you know God said the prophet and all these things and if God don't open that up to you really it's just hear say it's just hear say you say I heard this I heard that I heard that but when God open that up to you sir on ain't no false Doctrine out there that can shake you ain't no ain't no you know cuz sometimes young people I know you get hurt ain't no hurt that can stop you when God opens up truth to you ain't can't nothing turn you around let me tell you a part of my testimony I come I I wasn't raised in a Christian Home per se you know and some of you are looking like you thinking and you say all I am is just a message baby I born in this message all I know is this message I'm so sick of this message I wish I had a testimony that is a testimony amen that that is a testimony where you've never been in the world you've never been touched you don't have all this filth all over your over your life and over your past that is a testimony amen that is a testimony if if you if your life is still virtuous and and and and you know the things that speaks of Purity in the scriptures that is a testimony don't think that your your life is not powerful because you've never experienced the climaxes of sin your life is powerful because you have it that shows the grace of God that God can keep you right here in Satan's e and sometimes I I lay down and I say oh Lord I wish I had that kind of life amen amen amen amen yes sir like I said earlier I was talking going down the road minding my own business driving my car and I'm probably playing a good Christian song I know y'all wondering like what I be listening to Glory I give you a taste of it I'm Trading My Sorrows I'm Trading My Pain I'm laying it laying it down for the joy of the Lord amen you know I'm listening to music like that I'm going down the road and and you know another song come on I need you Lord I need you Lord right now see I started to answer that question you say what's your favorite song My Favorite Song is the song that bring me in his presence that's my favorite song Amen my favorite song no matter where I'm at if I hear it and it makes me think of God that's my favorite song whether it makes me want to y'all know me if if it make me want to do my thing hallelujah or if it just make me want to raise my hands Hallelujah that's my favorite song and you know I I I love to hit religious Spirits think about this church when we get young people when we get to heaven we you ain't going to have nobody talk about sit down and be quiet we can't we can't do that in church just just too much emotion just be quiet you know you you ain't been through nothing to be able to do that dance in church sit down you know I get right in their face when I feel that spirit and I say you know what when I get in heaven amen yes sir I said I said you know what brother Steve I said you know what I might be doing dances y'all wouldn't let me do down here sir cuz we going to be free amen ain't going to be no more pain no more hurt and sorrow and all this you ain't going to be up there saying man who am I going to marry let let me let let me finish let me finish let me let me we don't want to get in too much just let's leave it alone let me let me let me drop this in I know some of you are here because he or she is here ain't nothing wrong with that in the right environment in the right environment my prayer is that my daughter finds a holy ghost fill young man so I want her in those kind of atmospheres Holy Ghost fill atmospheres amen I'm not looking for some magic some young boy he's everything I I ever dream of it has to be everything thing she ever dream of I know that's kind of heavy for some of y'all amen but she has to make the right decisions and and love God and do all these things cuz he a't going to marry me yeah I know some of y'all think brother Steve say you keep marry your daddy and marry your mom we came up totally different as y'all can tell me and Steve are good buddies we're good with me and Steve are really good buddies and what he's preaching I've been to his house and I've seen it in action amen and it's the truth it's the truth I go I got like the day when he was preaching I was I was holding back cuz he was supposed to be talking to y'all and you know he was talking to some us I was like oh man that's you know but I realized I had to preach tonight so I trying to reserve my voice you know but that's what happens when you connect with the word you know what I mean it does something to you you know and I I sure enjoy that today and I I want I I encourage y'all see me and brother Steve we not in a popularity contest we not in who going to preach the best you and all that no we have me and him have the same goal we want to see y'all blessed amen we want to see you encouraged in the Lord getting closer to God and whether God use him or God use me the Lord be praised the Lord be praised sir so by no means if I if I say something things different than the way he said I am not trying to take away from what he says because I believe in his life I believe in his gift amen amen and and and and with brother Ben and brother AR as well but I have to be me and that's the greatest revelation can ever get when you know who you are in Christ okay let's go sincerity and truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord why would it seem evil to serve God that's what I'm asking you tonight why what is it that's stopping you from fully giving God all of you and listen how Joshua described this he says if it seems evil so obviously there's something about God if you haven't fully given your life yet that you don't think is a big deal so he's saying what is it if if it seems evil to serve the Lord evil serve the Lord use ye this this day whom you serve amen whom you will serve whether the gods which your father serve or whether the others side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord and tonight by God's grace I want to talk to you about the Power of Choice amen amen making a choice you know in everything you do you got to make a choice a decision amen but this is the thing I I want you to catch tonight about choices and decisions that whatever choice you make whatever decision you make there's a spirit behind it amen there's something motivating you to make that choice there's something motivating you to make that decision so as we go through this I want you I want you to think about what's causing you to make the majority of the decisions you make right you know if if if you know right now we're in a banquet and some of you had to make a choice by what you was going to wear tonight I told you I was going to get you some of you pull out the best suit you can find but not just any kind of suit but something that made you feel a certain way when you look in the mirror that you know you had a certain confidence y'all remember that you had a certain confidence about the clothes you put on and you know you you you you you Brothers put on a certain suit maybe it stands out a little [Music] bit you chose to make that choice but there was something about you making that choice and I hey look I ain't I ain't I ain't what's your name bro what's what's your name come on tell me your name Jerry Jerry I ain't picking on you cuz Steve know I like that right Steve didn't saw me dress like that I just couldn't I just couldn't give y'all all of me at one time you know so I had the ease into it you know so I ain't picking on you I'm just saying you know uh I could I can show y'all some pictures y'all be like is that brother digs sisters You' be surprised I love to shop I love to shop sometimes I feel like I got a spirit on me you know what I did when I got here I told Brother kin take me to a suit store amen you know but that's just me I don't I don't I don't I don't saag my britches I don't wear jerseys you know I ain't out trying to get the latest kicks I just Li I love buying church clothes cuz that's who I am I'm always in church clothes trust me this just this ain't nothing right ain't nothing I ain't want I ain't want nothing to get lost while I'm flying so Hallelujah but you know whatever you put on there's a choice behind it Hallelujah and you know you might have you Brothers might have chose a certain suit and match this color and match that color and what you did was you looked in the mirror at it you ain't just put it on and walk out the house but you looked at yourself you wanted to see what kind of image you was portraying what's going on behind them clothes what are you thinking about you know the same thing with the sisters you chose what kind of dress you was going to put on you know you matched up the colors with your skin and and and and did you know how sisters do all kind of stuff you know what I mean and and and and you matched up this and you matched up that and you had to have the perfect shoes and and oh this is the Clincher you had to make a choice on how you was going to do your hair but there's a Spirit by how you did how you did your hair too now there's a certain way you did your hair because there was something you was looking for you was looking for there was something you was trying to achieve and the and the decision you was making was geared more to that choice or what was pushing you doing that and you know you you easily could have flat IR your hat but you say no I'm going put some curls in this stuff no I I I flat out on regular service but we going to a banquet I'm going I'm going to Jazz this thing up I'm going put some curs in this thing oh I know what I'm talking about and then all that wind start blowing and you start [Music] thinking what were you thinking about my curls decisions choices there was something behind you doing your hair like that and like brother Steve preach there's nothing wrong with that in his innocent form right there's nothing the prophet of God said he they ask him a question should should the sisters wake curs whatever he says is in a woman to want to look nice he says I don't have no scripture for that just don't cut it yeah now for those of you who may be trimming and cutting why there's something behind you pushing that choice and when it's a against the word of God it's an evil spirit pushing you to make that choice and it seems so insignificant but it's a devil in your decisions and sometimes you can do things and you think I ain't bother nobody ain't no big deal but it's the devil who you're choosing it's the enemy that's gotten a hold of your thoughts and the decisions you making are the thoughts of the the enemy right something to think about it and you know you you you had your curls going and and we going to talk about decision The Power of Choice and decision now you got your dress on you got your you got your you got your uh uh you got your curls going and and then you know you want to make sure every the decision the choice you made is good so you start posing see there's something behind that decision there's something behind the choice of your hair the choice of your clothing the choice of you coming to this banquet you know everything you do there's a purpose behind and sisters I'm not you know I love young sisters you know like brother Steve you know I got three women in my life you know and and and believe me I know what it means to to run to the bathroom before them cuz once they get in there they got a lot of choices to make a lot of choices and we on the outside saying you finished are you finished it's decision time are you finished but now it's sad to say that the that the young men are getting pretty they getting pretty they a't they spend more time in the bathroom than the women what's behind that choice you ain't going to come to church ain't no girl going to run their fingers through your hair we ain't in denomination right you miss around get kicked out the church I ain't talking about the pastor coming to you talking I'm talking about the deacons grabbing you that's how we came up Hallelujah but you know choices and decisions and and and everything you make I want everything you do I want you to realize that there is a spirit behind it you know and even for the brothers or whoever I believe it was cherith had the desire to have this banquet you know in her heart I believe she wanted y'all to be able to experience how much of a good time she had at her banquet amen amen and I I really believe she was sincere cuz me one time me CH you remember Texas me laugh about that cuz I'm going just leave it alone she know what I'm talking about but you know uh there there's some things you do and and it don't work out the way you think it ought to work out you know either the devil fights it or God makes it freely move and sometimes the devil fights it and then God makes it freely move but you have to make a de a choice when it comes to the things of God to stand firm don't give up don't quit but keep pressing on but I want to show you in the Bible I want I want you to understand that the Bible started with making choices yeah amen God came to Adam and Eve he came came you know Satan came to Eve and trying to get to make a CH choice you know either either what did God say and this is the Clincher most of you you know when you doing wrong it's a four-letter word I'm looking for let me help you y amen we don't have to take a text and wait for some special message to correct you most of us know when we doing wrong we know right from wrong we've reached the age of accountability ain't nobody ain't nobody got to turn you around and say is this spiritual or is that spiritual should I do this or shouldn't I do that you were built with that inside of you you know right from wrong you know you you you you know when you should be making a good choice versus a bad choice keep in mind I said you going to reap what you s yeah amen but you know from that place the devil he name and tried to take Eve off of God's word and make a choice when she had everything she needed she didn't have to use her own reasoning she didn't have to use her own thoughts all she had to do was stay with the word of God she didn't have to worry about man am I going to make the right decision or should I do this or should I do that all she had to do was stay with the word amen the word amen the word will give you the results of your actions so in that purest form she all she had to do was just well God said it and I'm I'm going stay with it I I ain't doing nothing that's my choice no matter what you're saying devil that's my choice God said this you don't have to explain it it'll do what God said it'll do that's the choice we got to make amen you don't have to uh figure this out figure that out figure this figure that figure that figure this [Music] why don't you try this I won't after this camp meeting or even after tonight uh uh uh you get in the next service you hear some things you you you you may not understand I want you to try this Lord I believe amen just try that just just try that just show God you're willing to accept this word and just say Lord I believe Lord I believe and I promise you if you take that attitude with the word of God God will clear it up to you but you know what Eve did it sounded good you know and probably over a process of time or whatever however long it took she got she was hearing that so much till it got common to her she was in that environment so much of somebody trying to take away from God's word stay out of that environment stay stay out of a worldly environment stay out of an environment where somebody is always challenging your faith if so-called friends is always trying to pull you from under the confidence of the word that ain't your friend you got somebody who's always in somebody in your life is like come on girl let's go do come on hey look at bro we going over here we going over there hey we going we going to get some drinks and this and that and all this stuff you a young man I know and I know some of y'all are very afraid because you been hurt and and and all these things so you're afraid to go to the next level I know a young man who's looking for a wife so he had a young lady he was talking with where he was trying to get to know her and he called her one day she was out with her girlfriend you know in the background laugh in the background laughing and all kind of stuff ain't nothing wrong with that y'all know I like to laugh I love the laugh amen but you know uh but you know he he called

he finds out she's not who she say she was but you know what the clinch is she didn't really know him cuz she thought saying that wasn't going to be no big deal right she didn't know that in his heart he was really looking for God am and the woman he was looking for had to be looking for God yeah on so you can't judge a book by his cover am you can't look at some young man and think I ain't nothing to him he ain't this and he ain't that that could be the next Prophet right or missionary or Pastor or whatever you want to call it you know you can't look at a young lady and be like I ain't nothing to her she do she that or whatever you know she could be something very significant in the kingdom of God Amen you know he got real quiet on the phone he was just listening and you know what happened boy she knew she messed up she start back boy she start she was doing the Michael Jackson slide back she she was backing that thing up so fast but it was too late too late it was too late she was like oh no I I ain't mean to say that oh just you going to think different than me yeah I sure am yeah on I'm looking for sanctification yes sir and she realized that she messed up playing with God everybody let me say this in your rinks everybody in here ain't playing with God some people are honestly searching seeking the Lord's face cuz they're sick of the life that they lived already they want to get serious with God they they're tired of hearing about that God they want that God to be in them and they're they're even tonight they're making a choice Amen to say God I'm ready to go further yeah am but you know he had to that that kind of shook him up a little bit he was thinking like man what am I going to do you know and this and that or whatever you wonder how I know that story because you know me and him was pretty cool you know we were good people you know so he was telling me the story but when he told me the story I see now he got fear he's afraid to go on in his life you know he's like man these girls this man these girls that these girls playing games and [Music] I what they sound like a cry baby sound like a cry baby I like crying you get the Holy Ghost

your past Hallelujah God is a god of forgiveness Hallelujah God look once you repent and you're covered by the blood God don't see it no more amen so who's reminding you of it the devil Hallelujah the devil's reminding you of it amen so make the decision make the listen to me young people make the decision to forgive yourself amen amen make the decision to forgive yourself if you made youve made bad choices if you done some things you shouldn't have done and and now you're sitting here and you know the devil loves to talk to you he love to talk to you and tell you what you ain't yeah a you know he used tell me I I you know I didn't be went out the previous night and went been in the club and you know what I mean I call I I ain't Miss no Sunday morning now I was in church I did my thing Saturday night but I was in church I wasn't missing no church cuz my car was in my mama's name and she would tuck my car if [Music] I she would took my car if I wasn't in church so you know I played the role you know I praise God you know but you have to get to a place to where it's real when it's real to you it's real in your life that God has showed himself not to just be some uh story books yeah and sometimes you have to go through something you have to get desperate amen you have to get desperate you have to sometimes you have to separate yourself you know uh you know like these these group pictures we took sometimes it you have to be the only one in the picture you and God you know when you look at Eve the the devil got her to make the wrong decision and that decision changed the course of the whole world yeah amen but you know God gave them the Power of Choice amen that that decision wouldn't Define the rest of their life am y'all realize that God told them unless they take a hold eternal life and live forever God gave them that opportunity yeah you messed up but I want you to grab hold of eternal life and live for God again so Church there's always an uplifting yeah there's always an uplifting you just got to find that place where you allow yourself to believe amen amen allow yourself to believe in God Amen Hallelujah and if we if we go in the scriptures from there you look at you look at uh Eve and what she went through then you get to Abraham Abraham had to make a choice amen amen God told him say hey I'm calling you you the father of nation you know you and Sarah going have going to have a child I'm sending you in a place that you know was Builders and makers of God you don't you don't know nothing about what I'm going to do but you got to go and he had to make a choice to say Lord I trust you amen Lord I trust you but it was hard for Abraham cuz Abraham wasn't used to letting go and depending on somebody else so he did what he thought was right you know he he brought his whole family with him oh I'm moving to Australia y'all come with me when God only called him God called him he wanted he wanted that security of his family with him that was the wrong choice yeah yeah because what that did that prolonged the purpose of God in his life because God had to get all the other stuff that he was connected to that wasn't a part of what God called him to amen and once God got all that God didn't really deal with him until lot them got out the picture and think about that you got somebody with you Hallelujah God didn't call you you got somebody with you but they Desiring something else right lot was Desiring something else go Abraham was Desiring God and human lot get into conflict and now H look at the wrong choice they're sitting out there and Abraham Abraham knew that he owned everything and so he tells lot he say well ain't no need for us to be arguing you go wherever you want to go and I go the opposite direction amen and lot looked out there he she said boy he saw solom amen he saw a little building down there you know maybe it's saw a taranaki sign or something and uh he said I think I'm going go down there everything look good they got a snow peak Mountain down there I I think I'm going go down there he says okay well Abraham say I'm going to go the other direction yeah so he went down there he thought the choice was all right but then at night Sodom and gamar lit up it was on fire firecracker party and everything they hear all the noise and all the music and every and lot sitting there looking man he goes to bed and wakes up the next day night time comes he sits back down again he's looking down at Sodom and you know what he does y'all know me I'm acting again you know what he does he goes to his wife he say hey Mama lot cuz you know the Bible don't say what her name was you know so we just call him Mama lot hey Mama lot we about out of firewood so I'm going go down to Sodom there something behind that decision yeah it's more than just wood he been the Bible says as he turned his eyes as he looked towards something see he looked toward that way and it start to affect him it start having a pull over his life and now he's at a place where he's saying hey hey uh we need some grocery I think I'm going go down here s him and get some City well developed his wife don't know that he going through something family don't know he going through something but now he got a pull that's causing him to make a decision amen and now he's sitting there he's he say hey I'm going down there and then he go down there he get to the counter got that stuff and the guy say hey mate how you doing he said I'm doing all right man he like a good fell I'mma give you a discount he said oh boy you can get discounts inside them oh so he go back home said guess what honey I went down there I got a discount so he look again I'm going back down there he got he got a discount but this time he went in the city he saw belly dancer it's all kind of sin around amen all kind of stuff going on yeah so in the midst of him going to get some wood and get that discount Satan put something else in his face and then he see that then he go home and then he thinking about what he saw he like man well they got it going on in ockland I mean um Sodom gamar y'all forgive me ockland is the big city but you know then he get down there now he got reasons to make other decisions to stay in I to stay in Sodom and gomor you know so now he's going down there by choice freedom cuz it's there's a spirit behind his decisions and next thing you know he didn't dragged his family down and they didn't got stable everybody down and now all of them living in sin because lot made the wrong choice you know what the Bible says the Bible says it says remember Lot's wife when it's talking about judgment and these things say remember Lot's wife but you know what how did she get that way M right it's lot's fault lot tuck his family down there so lot was just is guilty we say remember Lot's wife lot took his family down there he made the wrong decision yes sir true I ain't going to we y'all out I know y'all but you know from that decision they were stuck down there amen and it took God to do deliver them am but go back and read it they were so wrapped up in that life they were so tied up and connected in it God sent Angels yeah to talk to them and tell them yeah make this decision come with me and you know what they doing what time the bus coming I got to my clothes I Ain I ain't ready yet I still got to do some more curl and angels are down there telling them God F to destroy this place and the word of that was the word of the Lord trying to get them to make a decision to escape but they wasn't so used to they didn't got so cold and so indifferent with the voice of God God is talking to them and they can't make the right decision don't get that way young people brother prophet of God said the worst thing can happen to you is for you to get numb towards God Amen if you get numb towards God if you get callous towards God y'all know what calluses are these things on my hand I'm a man don't do that bro don't do that don't don't embarrass yourself that don't do that no don't do that don't do that but you know uh he said calluses he said when you in your spirit you get numb and calluses that mean that there's no more effect you can't feel it that's right you you you the right decision you can't even feel it no more you're so used to just going Wayward and the worst thing the worst that's the worst way to be is where you don't care cuz Satan seeking to destroy you then yeah but as long as you got a piece of conviction you all right as long as you can say Lord help me you know what blows me away Rahab was a prostitute yeah but she was waiting on her day of Deliverance y'all realize that when those spies came she said we heard what y'all God in did in with she said in all all the hearts around here melt yeah they melt they afraid of y'all yeah she said but enough all that I need a token yeah amen for my family my brothers my mama my daddy my sisters I need a talking amen amen see she was going to make a decision even though her life was jacked up amen she made a decision for God to come in her life for God to be a savior Hallelujah so I'm here to say it doesn't matter what kind of trap the devil may have you in make the decision to go on with God and let him clean up your past let him clean up your life Hallelujah and you know you got you got Moses had to make a choice yeah y'all with me still amen amen everybody you with me amen all right and you know Moses had to make a choice think about this let's start with his parents first a degree goes out kill all the boys kill kill all of them kill all the boys cuz I heard somebody coming up going to be a deliverer kill everybody and the mama looks had a baby like brother Steve said oh my precious [Music] Moses and then she hear kill them I ain't killing my baby I'mma put him in the Nile I thought you w going to kill him but where was that decision coming from that wasn't her decision that was God moving on her Hallelujah and some things you may do you may seem like H should I should not but it's God directing things Hallelujah and you know Church she decided she she had to make a choice to give her child up and let them be killed or put her child in the river and trust God and she puts him in the river pictures the tent within and without with slime Hallelujah but she had to trust God she had to make a decision to trust God if this boy if there was something special about this boy but look God so rich in mercy God let Moses go down the Nile or or whatever it is the Congo River whatever whatever we want to call it they go he going down there he floating down there and God is protecting that sea Hallelujah then look at how God orchestrates things when you make a good choice Moses just goes down maybe it was a y'all know the kotto saac is maybe he just goes in a cc of water and he gets there and who's out there washing Pharaoh's daughter she had there wash and taking her bath got all her Maze and everything but what was significant about that God didn't just let Moses go to anybody he let Moses go to a woman who had a desire desire for a child amen hallelujah it was God allowing her to make that choice because God had every other piece of his life set up already amen and that's what happen to you when you get saved when you really get anchored and the Holy Ghost come God will begin to show you purpose Hallelujah but now Moses is growing he's in the Kingdom he growing in the Kingdom he getting the best of the best the finest of the finest the best teaching the best clothes you know what I mean he got women feeding them grapes he could had whoever he wanted everything Mo life was good for Moses but his mama kept saying son it's something different about you amen son you you you you ain't one of the Egyptians you're Hebrew Hebrew you you you you ain't one of them you one of God's people you a deliverer he thinking I'm Pharaoh I'm Pharaoh I'm being trained to be pharaoh on his Chariot I'm Pharaoh that's what they were building him to be the next Pharaoh but his mama is telling him no you're a deliverer you're one of us and he and he knew what his mama was he looked at the window didn't see the mud doers yeah so he had to make a choice who he wanted to be hallah the popular choice wasn't one of them yeah the popular choice was I aroh this is my kingdom yeah that would have been a popular choice but that wasn't God's choice amen hallelujah and what happened to Moses when he made that decision Hallelujah his life changed amen amen he gave up the kingdom he gave up the whole pH he gave up everything but what I love you know I was at some of the churches I preach the devil think he's smart m right that devil really dumb amen dumb devil amen yeah and he be boasting no the devil is really dumb amen cuz he makes the decree thinking he's going to whoever is the next deliverer he's going to kill him but Moses's mom Joseph be put him in sent him down there Pharaoh's daughter get him now Moses gets the best life he ever had he gets a life that his mama couldn't give him yeah he's been raised right up under the devil's nose in his own [Music] house let me let me let me let me calm down let me Cal he being raised right up under the devil's Nose getting the best of the best only to turn around and Destroy his kingdom amen you dumb devil Hallelujah you dumb devil so he don't realize he he he messed with me when I was young and listen to this rap music listen to this listen to that and now I'm his enemy amen so I can see that stuff when it's trying to come into church we ain't singing on Kurt Franklin no sir not up in Hill amen some of them know what I'm talking about not all of you but some of you know what I'm talking about and you know sometimes God will allow us to go through things so we can turn back around and use it against the D so if you if if if you've had a bad experience don't mope and cry let God use it for something good you've been taken advantage of by some worldly boy in church Hallelujah warn your other sisters about them now him personally but that Spirit H don't have a bashing group a we hate him we hate him they out put his picture up there and throw darts at him girl power no I ain't talking about that I'm talking about praying and and and and encouraging each other and lifting each other up H if you've gone through something now you be see I always say things like this when somebody slip up and fall or they do something or or or or something really bad happens morally and everybody in church know about it that ain't a time to Outcast that person or or or put their names on a chopping block and talk about them from here the kingdom come because really that person that messes up has become the grace of God to you because you look at the mistake they made and you say Lord please don't let that happen to me so really they become Grace if you look at it right right I'm about to close don't get nervous but you look at Moses and you look at the decision he made and he had to choose egyp or mud am yeah right and then just one day he couldn't help himself am he saw somebody being taken advantage of one of his brothers he went down there Egyptian got choked out he got choked out choked out Debo sty I knew the guys was going to catch that and then from there Hallelujah he was on the Run yeah but God wasn't done with him yet amen sometimes even when you trying to find your way you you you you make the wrong decision that don't mean God is done with you amen keep believing keep striving amen hallelujah make the right choice and before I close I want to drop something heavy on you a bomb y'all remember in the Bible Cain and Abel went to worship yeah y'all know that one y'all bible say that amen okay I'm just making sure they went to worship God accepted you know Cain probably went first cuz you know the devil always a show off you know he came probably went first and he got up in there and he start worshiping you know he probably start singing his songs and just worshiping you know throwing his hands up high he probably start praise dancing and doing all kind of stuff and God say h I ain't get nothing out of that H come on come on Abel so Abel got up there Abel had the lamb Abel start hacking the lamb able start singing How Great Is Our God sing with me how

for me you know he's hacking he's hacking them up and blood squirting every way you know what his mom and daddy were doing Adam and Eve was sitting back standing back looking and they're like marveling cuz it was a revelation yeah amen right and Eve probably looked at out and say did you tell him what I did did you tell him about my sin and Adam's like no I didn't tell him anything you know he's a very smart boy just like his daddy and then Eve says yeah right how does he know what happened how does he know it was blood Adam remember when I did what I did I religious covering wasn't enough and then God wrapped Us in skins dripping with blood how does know it was blood yeah see that baffled yeah it was a secret y ain't never thought about that but God revealed to himen Hallelujah God revealed to him and Abel had to make a choice to listen to that Revel and live that life Hallelujah and then Abel started you know he started worshiping and and giving God praise and you know he probably started singing Jubilee amen amen amen hallelujah and then and and then you know when it was all over Cain was mad bunch of emotion you know he all mad and everything and he ready to talk about his everything and then God says look you do like your brother you'll be accepted you'll do well listen to me good God gave the devil a chance to make the right [Music] choice amen you have no excuse God gave the devil an opportunity not to be a devil but what did he do he's mad the Bible say he walked out of God's presence God is a faithful God he's a just God like I said you going to reap
