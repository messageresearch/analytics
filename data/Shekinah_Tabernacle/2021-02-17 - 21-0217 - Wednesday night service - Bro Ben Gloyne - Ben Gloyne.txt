brother james thank you musicians amen praise the lord amen god bless you all tonight amen well it's brother james's birthday today so happy birthday brother james god bless you hallelujah amen it is great day brother brother jason sister paul here god bless you amen well it's great to see everyone here tonight see if this works technology maybe it doesn't work i might need the clicker anyway we're going to go to genesis chapter 14 verse 10. genesis 14 and 10 i'm going to read down to verse 16. and the veil of sidom was full of slime pits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their uh littles and went their way and they took a lot abraham's brother's son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of memory the amrite brother of ishkol and brother of uh and i'm sorry there's a um part of the pages taunts i can't um i don't have that were they and there and these were confederate with abram and when abram heard that his brother uh and abram and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto dan and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto uh hoba which is on the left side of damascus and he brought back all i like that word brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the woman also and the people amen and now we're going to go to you know you rely on technology to update but doesn't update so um do i have it here okay this is oh yes first samuel 30 and verse 1. okay that's different to this but it's meant to be the same we'll get there one day with something may we just go old school just be unplugged and you know maybe life was simpler that way wasn't it first time you're 30 and verse 1. now there's a pattern with these two there's a reason i'm reading these and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziglag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and zigleg and smitten zigleg and burned it with fire and had taken the woman captives that were therein they slew not any neither great or small but carried them away and went on their way so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep and david's two wives were taking captives the jezreelitis and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself from the lord his god what a great powerful secret that is right there and david said to abetha the priest uh ahimalaksha's son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abitha brought hither the ephod to david and david inquired of the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him don't you love when god answers pursue for thou shall overtake them and without fail recover all there's that word again amen now let's just bow our heads and word of prayer tonight amen in his presence we amen lord jesus we lord as um lord we approach you with such thanksgiving and joy in our hearts but at the same time great reverence lord because you are the lord god almighty lord you created heavens and earth and lord you've given us life upon the earth oh god to express you and i just pray father may lord as we have opened your word tonight lord we know anyone who can read can read your word but lord it takes you the great author to come lord jesus said lord we always want to see you at church lord you're the one we've come to worship you're the one we've come to fellowship with lord you're the one we've come to commune with oh god as we have gathered tonight and i just pray lord that you would come and meet every need oh god may you once again anoint speaker but not only speaker but hearer also oh god father may it be you doing the speaking but also you're doing the hearing in us oh god and lord take the service under your divine control we thank you lord we're not our own but we're bought with a price which is your precious blood so lord use us for your good pleasure this night dear god and as always we want to remember those who couldn't make it here tonight lord may be their portion be their strength father if they're sick and body as we just want to lift brother queben into your presence by prayer lord has injured his back but lord you're the lord god that heals all our diseases lord jesus you're the one lord who made his back so father i pray you touch his body and give him full movement lord and lord and strength once again lord may you grant it for your glory lord just want to commit the service into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen amen god bless your friends you may have your seats i'm going to need that clicker please it'll be real here we go awesome thank you very much now if i could title this tonight i want to speak about you know brother brown uses the expression it may sound a bit of a crude expression for a sermon title but a chip off the old block now we know that god has god has uh um attributes he has characteristics and and you know if just like a natural family you know there's characteristics that are passed down you know maybe a temperament maybe a way people speak maybe how they look you know you can see your family you know you know you know when you see children maybe you've never met the parents before but as soon as you meet the parents you say i know where you came from speaking to the children you know so there's so there's you know and and there's expression they're just a chip off the old block so as the old black block was or is so they are i mean so now we read here because abraham we know is the father of of of of the israelite people you know of the jewish race and we can see as you know as we look down through the scripture if you study you know the attributes that are in abraham you'll see them you know down through israel you know you know he was he was a priest we see that in the tribe of levi you know he was he was a mighty conqueror just like in david that's why you know we read the scripture here because as as um as abraham you know was yes yeah i'm sorry there we go as abraham was anointed you know we know that he was not a military man he did not have a professional army you know the you know he just armed his servants and they and they were but but yeah i believe they are anointed by god to to get locked back so everything that you know because we know lot was a part of abraham he was his family and and god allowed abraham you know abraham at this time to go get his nephew and everything that the enemy had taken away and and this is an attribute in the people of god you know when i talk about chips off the old block i'm really talking about you and i you know we should be able to look into the scripture and see the characteristics of the believer and see that same life is now in me i am in the same you know it's more than income paper now it's put on flesh and you and i so we can see that you know there's a reason that that that that abram was built this way is because god was expressing a part of himself and he's also expressing the same nature that was in him amen is in future generations you know just like abram you know when they went down they back slit a couple of times they went down into grey they went down to egypt and your abram would tell sarah you know tell them just you tell a lie you know say that we are brother and sister which kind of they work as they are half brother and sister but they were married and you know isaac did the same thing the next generation did the same thing and you know but but there's also positive attributes that are passed down and because we know in our flesh in our own humanity we will never manifest god's attributes but it takes the spirit of god a real new birth i mean the you know god living on the inside of the inside of us i mean if he comes and lives in us i mean then he will manifest his character manifest his attributes through our lives so so abram armed his servants and they recovered all hallelujah and we can see this now down into down into uh david's life where he came into a place of great distress you know but but you know and it says they wept until they had no more power to weep but you know he had a burden he must get his family back where did that come from that came from abram it was passed down a few generations but there he was in flesh again and what i love about the attributes of god is as you know the scripture tells us when the enemy comes in like a flight i'll raise up a standard so when the enemy raise up a flood i i mean raises up or comes in like a flood rather i mean god has an attribute upon the earth to meet the challenge of the day i mean to overcome in that challenge and and walk out victorious amen so we know david there's the challenge of goliath and we know who won that battle it was god's attribute against the devil's attribute and god's attribute won he he walked out packing the victory and it's the same thing where all their loved ones were taken you know but you know even even his own men were felt like you know this has just come to nothing you know this message we're following is just basically ruined our lives and we've just lost everything but david encouraged himself and the lord has gone and we must have such confidence it doesn't matter how good life is how bad life is how terrible life might be we just need to encourage ourselves in the lord i mean whatever the devil's stolen from us we have a right by the authority of god's word to go take it back i mean we don't have to live under our privileges we don't have to just become cold formal and powerless amen but we have a we have a right if our joy has been taken we can get that back if our peace that passes all understandings being taken we can get that back if our long-suffering nature is gone we can get that back hallelujah if our love is gone and we just have a critical spirit we just look at everyone say this person's wrong this person does this this we can get rid of that and get love back hallelujah i mean because if david could recover all we can recover all too and this is the hour for us to recover all hallelujah amen this is this is where we are so now i was telling you on sunday about mama eagle how she would display her power and and what what her burden was now i'm just trying to find my slide which isn't here but it's not there what her burden was or is is that her children would recognize the same life as in them and that's what god has been trying to do down through down through the you know ever since time began he's been wanting his sons and daughters to see the same life that's in me is and by a new birth in you i mean even even under the blood of bulls and goats i mean the believers did incredible things we know god has an attribute of a deliverer it's a characteristic of us he is a deliverer and so he comes down he speaks to moses because that characteristic was in moses that attribute was in moses but it had to come to life and everything that moses lacked the burning bush had he just had to step into that presence for just a few minutes and everything he needed in life i mean to overcome in his day came to life in him hallelujah it's the same thing with you and i all we need is more of god that's all we really need we just need more of the holy ghost we need more of his word living on the inside of us you know we can try and work things out in our mind but really man has been trying that and we're going to have a nuclear war right so how's that working out it's not working out very good my bomb is bigger than your bomb well i'll fire my bomb before you fire your bomb well it's going to end up pretty bad that's man trying to work out trying to fix the world but we have something that's greater than than you know human reasoning we have the word of almighty god hallelujah and we must never ever lose confidence in our weapon when we must never forget who we are we must remember who we are we must get up in the morning i trust you do i don't but maybe we should start doing it so i'm a son of god or i'm a daughter of god lord you called me why do we pray in the morning we commit our ways into a into his hands do we not we say lord you're my shepherd you're my god i need you to be my shepherd today lead me through this day what are you declaring father i'm your child i need you to take me by the hand and lead me through the day i mean because if he leads us we're going to end up pretty good i'm not talking about him prosperity we can be homeless on the street but if you know him that's all we need really hallelujah now i don't know why this is not that if it's not i'll just blank that and i'll talk from this there we go now everyone loves to read romans 8. and we know that all things work together for good for them that love god and to them who are called according to his purpose i'll say if this message has found you you've been called according to his purpose so many people love him but we're also called according to his purpose because remember his purpose of the hour is to call the bride and take her in a rapture that's god's program today hallelujah and for them he did for no he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so if he has you know if he has foreknown us he has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son now we know the image of his son is his word so god has predestinated us that our endpoint will be will be conformed to the image of his word so so it goes from ink on paper into flesh so what you read about a believer should be in here you should see it living in you because that's a person that's been conformed to his image it's more than just quoting scripture quoting quotes but it's a life lived hallelujah amen so we have an input so so if we're conformed to be the image of his son we're going to be a chip off the old block hallelujah amen and i believe i'm looking at a few chips glory if the lord says i'm something i'll say yeah amen i'm told before i am if he told me a certain thing if he says he loves me with an unfailing love amen i'm loved if i'm accepted in the beloved because he told me i i receive that i mean if he said he's washed all my sins away amen let it be unto me according to thy word lord hallelujah so he's building he's building he's taking chips off the old block and he's conformed then to be he's predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified it's all done hallelujah now brother braham says in the masterpiece now for nearly 2 000 years god has been making him a masterpiece because he struck adam to get a piece off of him part of him a rip to make a wife for him now and now that perfect masterpiece that he struck at calvary he got a piece off of him it's just the new testament that's all he fulfilled the old testament now it's the new testament another piece to be fulfilled see the old and new as husband and wife see and it taken the taken the altar for show the new christ came the masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the new testament another masterpiece in the making so when he's saying here that that you know this piece that came off him is just a new testament he's not just talking about income paper he's talking about living epistles read and known of all men hallelujah so he's saying now that there's another masterpiece in the making what is it it's a chip off the old block hallelujah i'm talking about you remember god wants us to know who we are because brother ram says when she recognizes who she is then the rapture will go because we need to and revelation gives us overcoming power over the devil i mean if you you know if we get in our minds that will never be victorious we won't be victorious you know if we're you know if we get in our minds that we can never overcome something we never will overcome it but if the word comes along and says no you're more than a conqueror through him that loved you i mean you're more than able i mean we're more than conquerors we're not just congress but more than conquerors so therefore anything that's fighting us we will overcome it hallelujah but if we have a failure mentality we'll be failures but if we have a victorious mentality and because brotherhood says the right mental attitude towards any promise that god will cause it to come to pass hallelujah so we want to have the right mental attitude towards the word and what's that right mental attitude lord it's for me you purchased it for me thank you lord it's on its way hallelujah amen because really it's not you that's going to fulfill the word in your life it's him but we we have to give ourselves to it amen now in pentecostal forgot or full gospel peoples around the world i find them with a great faith and the reason they have faith is because they have stepped up a little father they have been born of the spirit of god which is the supernatural and many people tell me brother brown as you get older you look like your dad well he's my dad that's the reason i look like him well now the same thing many things that we have that we uh we uh by a family strain like that to each other and then in the family strain of god we become born of the spirit of god we take on the nature of god which then we are the sons of god i mean so there's a family strain down through you can see the family tree and there's a common thread down through the family tree what is it faith in the word of god for their day amen oh look that's why abraham he staggered not at the promise of god i mean through unbelief his own body was dead sarah's body was dead they couldn't have a child but he didn't stagger at those things he took the word of god above how he felt what he saw i mean what he knew you feeling yeah are you following me he took the word above those things and counted that as not and took the word of god said no we're going to have the child hallelujah amen and because sarah was part of the promise god visited them himself i mean and gave her faith to then then she could judge him faithful and then they had the promised son hallelujah amen now that you know that's why when you read hebrews 11 what is it it's like a family tree and there's common threads down by faith through faith hallelujah and then if the bible was continued to be written down through to this age and past you your name would be in there because why because it's now a book of acts is still being written by faith hallelujah by faith i overcame ladies by faith they walked with god like enoch remember there's a characteristic that was an enoch and elijah they took a rapture hallelujah and that same characteristic as in you and i hallelujah amen now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in the glass of glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so we're beholding something and it's transforming us the world is beholding something and is deforming them but the bride is beholding something and they're being transformed what is it the word of god now this word where there is liberty it does not mean you're free to do whatever you want as the as the modern church would like it to be i'm free because jesus forgave me and you know his blood means i can just keep sinning and everything's fine that's not what it means i meant yo that's actually a catholic idea instead of them paying for it you know like that you know that's why martin luther was so outrageous because people are going around you know selling novenas or whatever it's called which is basically i will pay the priest a certain amount of money then i can go do a sin but it's already been forgiven so if i had the right amount of money i could actually pay for sin and i'm going to go murder someone but i've already paid for the sin so then i can go do the sit and then you know that's why he's so outraged and they all did it to build big churches yep so you know yeah it's you know it's like an insurance policy you can't get in trouble because you've already been forgiven but it's all premeditated and and the people instead of taking the physical money they say well the blood of jesus christ is that way but if the blood of jesus christ ever comes upon you it'll change your nature that you have no desire to do those things amen that's what grace is grace is a divine influence upon the life i mean uh you know a divine influence upon the heart and it's reflection in the life if you go look at the strong concordance meaning hallelujah so if you say if someone's really under grace they'll be living the word of god because the divine influence of his word has come upon the heart has been reflected in the life so this word liberty the root meaning it means unrestrained which means to go at pleasure means you can go if you want that is at a citizen um as a citizen and not a slave so so this liberty means that we're no longer slaves we're no longer bound but we can go as citizens hallelujah so we're no longer just slaves being being used by the devil made to do whatever he wants us to do but now we're citizens of a kingdom and there's the kingdom of our lord jesus christ we're free to go at liberty so we're no longer under the bondage of the devil but now we're we are sons and daughters of god in his kingdom hallelujah amen so where the spirit of the lord is there is that liberty hallelujah that's why we need more of the holy ghost all the time because because where that where the spirit lord goes from slavery comes in what happened with samson you know the spirit of god was upon him the philistines would come they just ended up dead and he was victorious but because he gave his heart to the wrong person he gave his heart to a woman not to god i mean then then the anointing left him because he revealed a secret to her what so he so he wasn't liberty because the spirit of the lord was there but now he went into bondage we want to continue to be free that's you know that's one thing we need you know we need to contend for liberty and the holy ghost hallelujah amen brother brahm says this is invisible union i know uh yeah i put it on the whatsapp but if you're married to christ christ is the word of god and saint john the first chapter said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was made flesh and dwelt among us christ was the living word he always was the word he still is the word he always will be the word he was the only manifestation of the attributes of god for he was the son of god and any son is the attribute of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when you when he was a young boy you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you then through the bedding grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the earth and be and become in the image of your father then he could have fellowship with you and so were you sons of sons of god and daughters of god before there's even a moon stars or a molecule you are sons and daughters of god for you are the only for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in god at the beginning for there's only one form of eternal life and that was that was you before you know nothing about it neither did you know when you was in your earthly father but you are manifested you too in his image in the image of god you're made and you're manifested for the glory and the fellowship of god i mean so we are right now the bride is the physical manifestation of the attributes of god so what was in his mind is now in flesh just like david was in his mind abraham was in his mind all the believers down through the ages now we are here hallelujah so you know it's just like abraham would speak of levi he says as i may so say levi also who receive tithes paid tithe in abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him so paul is not saying figuratively he's saying literally levi was in abraham when he paid tithes and that was attributed to levi hallelujah so he's saying literally levi was an abraham and it was attributed to to levi even though levi knew nothing about it it's the same thing with you and i why is the cross become a reality i mean because the lord the bride was in him when he went to calvary and he purchased our salvation that day on calvary and so that sacrifice is now attributed to you hallelujah that's why it becomes more than a story more than an isa becomes a reality my my lord jesus literally died on calvary took my sins far away living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified me freely forever one day he's coming a glorious day hallelujah amen so levi was a priest abraham in his life was a priest he gave spiritual sacrifices to god so the attribute of a priest and abraham went down into levi hallelujah now if we're chips off the old block we need to see what the old block does amen because the old block that i'm talking about has nothing bad in it you turn it you know it's the pearl of great price the scripture talks about hallelujah he's incredible block hallelujah you know this may sound very simple but you know i'm just so happy i'm a son of god i'm so glad he's my father that means more than life itself to me hallelujah now as abraham was was determined he was going to get locked back he got locked back and that same attribute of being a deliverable went into david you know it went into others but it came down into david and he was determined i'm going to get everything back no doubt he made a list i remember a few years ago i think it was now i said make a list make a list of everything the devil's taken from you or what you want make that list and then now what does that do it gives you a purpose because many times in life we wander along and the weeks all blend into the same and the seasons just roll around and life seems almost meaningless but it's not meaningless even joseph down in prison saw there was a purpose he was down there he didn't he may not have understood the day-to-day but he had a couple of dreams that said he was gonna he was gonna come to a place of authority that his own family was gonna bow down to him and he no doubt saw that that this was somehow the fulfillment of that dream it was in motion so so so he lived with purpose right he wasn't just floating along in prison saying was me no he went into action and it should be the same thing with you and i you know the rapture's a revelation i trust has been revealed to you this body's going to get changed hallelujah it may be today i love you today hallelujah hallelujah you know that's actually a revelation this thing's going to change and if i go by the way the grave this ain't staying there yeah i heard brother brown i'm talking about yo he's among the full gospel businessman he's talking today about assurance you know what yeah yeah yeah he's asked the question what do you do assurance you know what business assurance oh really where's the headquarters of this company he says glory the guy doesn't really understand what he's talking about he says blessed assurance jesus is mine and you know another insurance guy said no but billy that won't get you into the cemetery but he says it'll it'll get me out and that's the kind of policy i want hallelujah and if you haven't taken one of these eternal life policies i encourage you with everything within you get one hallelujah because that's all that's going to matter that's right hallelujah so now david david got all as i said write a list if you haven't written that list write it everything children family everyone in church neighbors work colleagues write it down fruits of the spirit everything just write a list and then seek the lord say lord you see this list this is my inheritance is it not the word says our children our inheritance hallelujah repent and be baptized name the lord jesus christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise unto you and your children hallelujah so if i've got one part of that promise i want the second part because it's all part of the same promise hallelujah so now that will give you purpose in life amen it'll actually give you purpose because joseph's life was fixed around two dreams his whole life was fixed around these two dreams and that that's what drove him day by day and if we have a purpose then our life will actually be focused you know this you know this this ages and age of just you can just be so distracted so distracted in this life yeah there's so many different voices so many things you know you know the internet is just a vast big i don't know i don't know the stats of how many new videos are uploaded onto youtube every day it's a lot of viewing time it's a lot of viewing it's not just one or maybe 100 videos it's like i don't know it's crazy but you know so you could spend and i and i don't recommend it but someone could spend literally about a hundred lifetimes trying to watch everything up there but it's so vast and it just gets greater and greater and greater it's just a distraction but what's our what's what's our motivating factor you know brother isaac could probably say this better than me but you know normally well i might be totally wrong but you know actors before they play a scene sometimes they ask what's my motivation what's my vote what's my motivation for this scene and then the director will say well this has got to happen this and this and you've read the script and this is how i want it to be and you know and and that should be the question we should ask ourselves lord he's a great director isn't he he's given you a role you're not a tree in the corner on the stage you're actually the main event harley just like esther and all you know i love watching plays of bible dramas because you know what's going to happen but then you enjoy it unfolding you know and you know no doubt the audience they know what's going to happen you know if we you know if we put a play on if the youth put a play on i know joseph or moses or ruth or anything we would all come watch it even though we know what's going to happen we know there's not going to we know when the plot twists come we know when the villain comes you know when the villain gets defeated we know when the lord over intervenes we know all those things but we're excited because we want to watch what was in the mind of the director is now going to be put in flash hallelujah maybe we have our ideas how it's going to be or should be but really it's the mind of the director that actually comes out hallelujah it's the same thing you know we have a great director or brother man called a great composer and he has a script and he's called you to a role you're not the villain of the play you're not the lady i've seen in the play you're the bride of christ in the play hallelujah and he's built you to play that role you know you hear people famous stars they say you know they play a certain role and they you know people say they were born to play that role they you know how they look and how they speak and how they act is just yeah it's just like they were made for that role we're made for a role as the bride of christ we're made for a role we may not feel like it some days but we're we're built for a role joseph was built for a role that life would be preserved when it was needed to be preserved hallelujah so we should really say what's our motivation in life i tell you if you write a list that'll give you a purpose hallelujah now i'm not talking about what size mentioned we're in a holiday house here and this now i'm not talking about that on the list you know i'm talking about redemption what people being saved healing coming you know reconciliation coming whatever it may be those kind of things hallelujah amen we're here for a role we're here for a purpose yes he therefore that minister ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doth he do it by the works of the law or by hearing of faith even as abraham believed god and was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same with the children of abraham and the scriptures foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith hallelujah i uh yeah i read things i'm like he's talking about me i was a heathen i got justified by faith hallelujah i like you know simple things make me happy anyway preach before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham so they who are of the household of faith are blessed with faithful abraham abraham got lot and everyone back yes amen hallelujah we have the same ability now we don't have to go get arms and get knives and guns and go you know that's not what we're talking about but there's demon powers that are hell-bent on destroying you and i they are you know the devil's got purpose in this hour he know he he knows he has but a short space of time he knows his time is coming so he's putting everything into overdrive that's why this world is falling apart so rapidly everything is in motion and the end times has been coming for a long time this thing that we see in the world right now has been 400 500 years in the making and here we are at the end of the end so if he is if he has got a purpose and a motivation and he's going to lose how much those who are going to win hallelujah you know sometimes you see that this is you know you watch um not that i've done this in the last decade but probably but you know you see you know teams like the all blacks playing japan and rugby and they annihilate them 100 something to nothing there's no what i'm talking about take off your angel wings you know but you know but why don't they just maybe get one try and just sit out the rest of the game no they're going to see how big a score they can get right and and and i say that you may think well that's a silly thing to say but you know i say that because how much victory do you want we know jesus has paid it all if you know the lord you know you're going to heaven right brother ram said that i could hunt and fish for every day for the rest of my life i'll still go but how much victory do you want how many trophies do you want on the wall of what the lord has done in your life that's not you doing it there'll be nothing to boast about up there of our own human ability when we're gathered around the throne you yo i say lord jesus you got me here when that spirit came when when all of hell was pointed their guns against me you you deflected every bullet and then you turned them back on himself hallelujah i mean when that pain came into my life you healed me of that pain that complex came along you broke that demon of complex harley you gave me the victory over this when i went when i had burdened for my family went after them you got them it wasn't me getting them you got them so how much victory do you want i want to nail a million to nothing hallelujah why not yeah the lord you know the lord loves to see us loves to see us take him at his word you know we rejoice when the lord does something you know he rejoices too those are my children they chip off the old block hallelujah as i kick satan out of heaven they're kicking him out on earth hallelujah as you know as i conquered hell death in the grave they're conquering too hallelujah you know you look at this great block that we're a chip off hallelujah he was in david david was a mighty conqueror hallelujah he recovered all hallelujah and that was just a shadow was christ and david moses went down and spoke to pharaoh said pharaoh i'm taking everyone amen we're not even leaving a hoof behind we are not leaving nothing not even our livestock everything's coming worth and you know what happened everything came with hallelujah hallelujah that was just a shadow now here comes the mighty conqueror himself god says i'm going to show you chips this is how the block operates because remember we're beholding something yes and what we behold will become you know i remember when i was young i wanted to be danny morrison giving away my age with cricket i wanted to be russell cootes with sailing i want to be all different kinds of people because i beheld an image and i wanted to become that image and they were my heroes my heroes were not men who wore lycra and your head you know had their undies on the outside and ran around by night with a cape on they weren't my heroes sportsmen were my heroes but then one day i met my real hero and and you know he's he's far greater than a sports person he's far greater than some superhero you know he's a lord of glory he's my hero hallelujah you know he's the kind of man who'll go to a funeral and it can't stay a funeral amen he's the kind of one who just says peace be still and the wind's a wave obey him he's the one who who doesn't leave people sick but he heals them he goes to people called legion and those people called legion everyone else tries to avoid them and think there's no way this person can get help and he just goes and says i'll show you they can be helped hallelujah that's my hero hallelujah my hero is not a hero of history that we read about from 2000 years ago my hero's in today i mean my hero can take a man or take a woman and show the power of his blood hallelujah you know i love it that the devil doesn't have the keys to his own house i love it he doesn't have the keys to his own house i mean when he thought he had the prince of life and he sat down in his lazy boy cheering hell and there's a knock on the door and that king of glory stepped in and you know and then and then satan said i finally got you now i thought i had you with abel i thought i had you with moses i thought i had you with john the baptist but now i finally got you but the tables were turned because our lord said no satan my blood is still on the cross dripping there i've purchased adam's fallen race i am now the conqueror of hell death and the grave give me the keys hallelujah and then he went from there took the keys off satan ascended up to paradise hallelujah where the thief on the cross just went in and said boys hallelujah i saw him where'd you see him did you see him on the shore of galilee do you see this and this and this and no no he was hanging on the cross right with me hallelujah hallelujah and he said today you'll be with me in paradise now i'm in paradise but where is he hallelujah and then the door comes open there's brother cairo said at camp his presence goes before him holly and then he steps into the room there's children you've been waiting a long time but now let's ascend up high holly and david was there and you know he prophesied open up the everlasting gates and be lifted up that the king of glory shall come in he prophesied that and then he finds himself living out that scripture wouldn't that be an incredible thing you know he's there in that great train as the saints go up high and you know then there's the call to the ramparts open up your gates and be lifted up that the king of glory shall come in then the response comes back down who is the king of glory and then he himself says the lord he is the king of glory mighty in battle and he's probably you know this is just me but wouldn't that be incredible you prophesy something and you find yourself living it out amen hallelujah we're going to speak our outcome hallelujah if we say no we're not leave one hoof behind i believe it's going to happen we should never settle for you know i i can't remember which brother said it at one of the easter conventions up in auckland but he said you know we're not made to be peacekeepers with the devil a peacekeeper just keeps the peace between two factions and you know no no that's not what we're built for we don't wear blue helmets and drive around in white armored vehicles and don't do nothing hallelujah we're here to conquer we're here to drive them out there's a principal work of the churches to cast out the devil hallelujah even as the word goes forth what does it do the washing of the water of the word takes spirits to try and latch themselves upon you trouble your mind it washes them from us hallelujah says the principal work of the church is casting out satan amen it's our job description that's a good idea mark 16 is our job description hallelujah hallelujah now the father his son is a good boy now this is brother around dramatizing about a tutor raising a son for adoption his father right along he's a tutor the holy spirit which which way the holy spirit he said i'm going to walk the tudor said i'm going to walk this i'm the child says i'll walk right with you i'll go with you oh the hill is awful hi son i'll go right with you i've got confidence in you if you start getting tired he'll raise my hand up and hold on hold me on but there's lines up the hill there see the tutors trying to sometimes the lord actually kind of tries to discourage us just like elijah and elisha just stay here i'm going on but elisha said no no no ask for a double portion i'm following with you until i get that double portion hallelujah amen there's he says but there's lions up on that hill there don't matter as long as you're around don't make a bit of difference i'm walking right along with you there's trouble up there it's slick rocks i don't care as long as you're holding my hand i'll walk right with you i'll walk right with you oh you know what your dad used to do that see that's good yes sir see what's he so the son is saying to the tutor as long as you're there i'm walking right with you this is what this is all about and the lord says okay i'm going to go this way this is what i'll come with oh there's trouble there's a lot you know this world is uh full of darkness and devils and things and i'll walk with you through it lord as long as you're holding my hand i'm gonna be okay hallelujah get to the top of the hill there oh he said you know what father your son is just like a chip off the old block he is absolutely exactly like you every word that you say he says amen to it i had him turn over in the bible the other day and it said jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you know what he said he screamed and thrown up his hands up in the air said hallelujah man oh you know it says here in your word um you know where you said the works that he uh he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also yeah i remember writing that to uh that to my son yeah i remember writing that oh when he saw that he just screamed and jumped up and down holla amen lord take all the world out of me make me like that yes sir and all those things that he had done isn't that how we should be lord i see you take all the world out of me make me like this hallelujah amen you see it through the new testament where jesus conquered he wasn't intimidated by anything the scribes the pharisees the high priest he wasn't intimidated by it he says i've come to do i'm you know i've come to do my father's will this is why i'm here and then you see that same life going to the go into the apostles where beforehand they were cowards they run peter denied and all kinds of things but then after the upper room they said should we serve god or serve man hallelujah now once again here it is all that the father cometh now now david got all back abram abraham got locked back in everything now here's the one that they were pointing to being shadows they're pointing to the reality all that the father hath given me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i'll know why is cast out for i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me this is this should be our this should be our motto in life i haven't come to do my own will i've come to do my father's will and this is the father's will which hath sent me that all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone that seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day what's that got to do with us you may be asking i'll just throw the question out there well do we want everyone to see him in us that they would believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever in our conduct how we treat people how we treat our families how we treat our spouses how we treat people to be salty amen don't we want people to see jesus that we actually have something that's just not an it's not an argument it's not a different church system but it's a real living reality of god that's what we want hallelujah i'm just gonna i'm just gonna take this back here i will i'm just going to leave this i'm going to close with this scripture therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not only which is of the law but to that also which is of faith of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as is written i have made thee a father of many nations before he whom he believed even god who quickened the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were now that same faith should be in you and i yes i don't see the promise i don't know how it's going to happen i don't understand how it happened physically it seems impossible but he called those things not as though they were isaac's on his way sarah how are you feeling nothing he's coming 20 years of that he turned up hallelujah that's perseverant you know brother brown preaches perseverant perseverance quite a lot it should be a theme of our lives to be perseverant in the faith don't give up don't quit don't be discouraged you know joshua was told be strong and very courageous don't be discouraged press the battle failure will come amen failure will come we will fail god miserably sometimes and we'll be ashamed of ourselves but don't lay face down in the dirt it's not him that fall of him that gets back up says lord try me one more time hallelujah who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb and staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief it was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that he uh what he had promised he was also able to perform see so so so he just it was just anchored in his heart god's going to do it it was really that simple god's going to do it we're going to take a rapture how's that going to work god's going to do it my family's going to come in how's it going to happen god's going to do it i don't know how we can overcome this world god's going to do it through us yes hallelujah and being fully persuaded i'll just repeat that verse and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform and therefore it was reputed to him for righteousness amen he believed the word as it was promised him and it was imputed to him for righteousness now he's the father of the faith hello children of abraham how are we today we can see in the old testament that he staggered actually quite a lot you say well how does paul how does paul reconcile this well by the blood of jesus christ and he actually had faith in the promise when when paul writes the divine commentary of abraham's life all that staggering is not even there it's actually not a contradiction in scripture because the old testament's under the blood of bulls and goats where all their failings and things were shown but under the blood of jesus christ they're not even written about like is not attributed to them but he was persevering for 20 odd years and he got isaac let's keep pressing the battle remember we have a role let's let's let's live that role out hallelujah amen musicians we just finished there he said i'm going through a real battle just take god at his word the devil will always tell you that the word is not for you and and it can't be fulfilled in your life he will never come along imagine if i was the devil i said isaac the word's going to happen you'd actually say no hold on that's not how you talk because the devil doesn't talk that way he'll always give you doubt and you always try and place the evidence place the emphasis of it being fulfilled on your lap how are you going to do it he always tries to put you in the equation but it's actually it's you and god and god said i'll do it god told abraham you're going to be the father of nations i'm i've made you the father of nations i've changed your name to actually show you that and so it wasn't abraham saying okay how's this deal going to work you know in terms of what am i going to do that it you know all that ended up was with was an ishmael a wild man it wasn't his humanity that brought it forth it was god's promise him taking god at his word amen aren't you glad the lord put something in our hearts we can just take him at his word holy that we can just walk with him amen praise the lord um let's say uh let's stand shall we tonight and um i want to sing that chorus oh could you turn me down please um i want to sing that chorus just more of you and then i want to sing magnify the lord with me amen more of you i've had it all but what i need is more of you who wants more of him there's more to have amen oh more of you more of you [Music] oh i've had it all but what i need is more of you [Music]
