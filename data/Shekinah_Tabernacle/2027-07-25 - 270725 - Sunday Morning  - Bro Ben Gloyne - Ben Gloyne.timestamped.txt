[3:09] God bless you all this morning.
[3:13] You good? Victorious in Christ.
[3:17] Amen. That's who we are this morning.
[3:19] It's good to be alive. Did you wake up
[3:21] happy to be alive this morning?
[3:24] You can't do much when you're dead.
[3:26] [Music]
[3:29] There's no opportunity to have faith
[3:31] when you're dead.
[3:32] [Music]
[3:39] I go through a lot of stuff, you know,
[3:40] and that that if you
[3:43] when you go through a lot of hard times,
[3:44] you have I have this point that I reach
[3:46] and I think it's not over till it's
[3:48] over. Sometimes you can let some problem
[3:51] overwhelm you in your mind.
[3:53] thinking things, but it's not over till
[3:55] it's over.
[3:58] It ain't over till it's over. So, if it
[4:00] ain't over, then there's hope. And it's
[4:01] not over yet. Like, brother Cadre Diggs
[4:04] preached, to be continued. So, if you
[4:06] ever get in a tight spot and you're
[4:07] letting it all get on top of you, just
[4:09] think it ain't actually over till it's
[4:10] over.
[4:12] You know, and as believers, we'll never
[4:14] be over.
[4:16] Amen. Let's stand this morning. I'm just
[4:18] feeling good this morning. I feel like
[4:19] the Lord's going to bless us in a in a
[4:21] powerful way in our midst. I feel like
[4:22] he's going to move. We're going to have
[4:24] a good song service. We're going to have
[4:26] um an anointed preaching service. So,
[4:29] let's just commit the service to the
[4:31] Lord this morning. Lord, we're so
[4:32] excited to be in your midst this
[4:34] morning, Lord, to be in a place where
[4:36] the spirit of God can come and move and
[4:39] dwell in a powerful way amongst us,
[4:41] Lord. And we just want to commit the
[4:42] service to your hands this morning, Lord
[4:44] Jesus. May you just bless each one
[4:45] that's here, Lord. May you may you fill
[4:48] each one aresh with the Holy Ghost,
[4:49] Lord. May we be may we leave here
[4:52] rejoicing, Lord, and be like those that
[4:54] that were walking with you on the road
[4:56] to Emmas when they said did know our
[4:58] hearts burn within us as he talked with
[4:59] us along the way. Lord, may that be our
[5:02] testimony this morning that may our
[5:04] hearts burn within us this morning,
[5:05] Lord, as we as we bathe in your
[5:07] presence, Lord, and we let the word of
[5:09] God enrich our life, Lord. Lord, and let
[5:11] your spirit just soften our heart, Lord,
[5:13] and warm each heart this morning, no
[5:15] matter how cold it is outside. We thank
[5:17] you that we can be Christians, Lord, and
[5:19] have a Lord, a heart that's warm towards
[5:21] you, and just a heart that's full of joy
[5:22] and full of love, full of peace, full of
[5:25] overcoming power, Lord, full of hope.
[5:27] And we thank you, Lord, that we come to
[5:29] the victorious God this morning, Lord.
[5:31] We read in all of your all of your word,
[5:34] Lord, that any man or woman all
[5:35] throughout the ages that ever trusted in
[5:37] you, they always came out victorious,
[5:39] Lord, and trusted in your word. So, we
[5:41] just want to trust in you this morning.
[5:42] Trust in your word, Lord. We cast out
[5:45] reasoning. We cast out any unbelief this
[5:46] morning. We cast out anything, Lord,
[5:48] that would exalt itself above your word,
[5:50] Lord, above your promises. We cast those
[5:52] things aside this morning. And we we
[5:54] walk in complete faith this morning in
[5:56] you, Lord, as we just continue to walk
[5:58] in the victory. So just commit each one
[6:00] to your hands in Jesus wonderful name.

[19:10] and the adversary
[19:13] says give in.

[19:28] again.
[19:30] He never promised.

[19:51] a victory without fighting. But he said
[19:55] hope will always come in time.

[21:04] in the valley of decision
[21:08] and the adversary
[21:10] said give
[21:14] just hold on.

[35:37] we've got an extra set of speakers here.
[35:38] We're just trying to balance the sound
[35:40] out in the room. So bear with us. Um
[35:42] it's easier than just plugging in
[35:44] things. So just bear with us with that.
[35:46] Amen. Um yeah. So good to be back from
[35:49] the minister's meetings. Got back last
[35:51] night. So didn't have as much time as
[35:53] I'd like to to prepare. So bear with me
[35:55] if it just kind of a little bit of toss
[35:57] salad or doesn't quite come out right.
[35:59] But you know you love me. E the Lord's
[36:01] good. So so you know let's just um Amen.
[36:06] So let's turn to the scripture this
[36:07] morning. Uh we're going to go to
[36:08] Genesis. Uh, sorry. We're going to go to
[36:10] Galatians chapter 3. Um, yeah, I have
[36:13] the have it here.
[36:18] We're just going to read Genesis. Sorry,
[36:20] don't know why I'm saying Genesis all
[36:22] the time. Uh, Galatians 3:23-29.
[36:36] Amen. It says here,
[36:39] "But before faith came, we were kept
[36:41] under the law, shut up unto the faith,
[36:43] shut up unto the faith which should
[36:45] afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the
[36:48] law was our school master to bring us
[36:50] unto Christ, that we might be justified
[36:52] by faith. But after the faith has come,
[36:55] we're no longer under a school master,
[36:56] but we are all the children of God by
[36:59] faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of
[37:01] you as has been baptized into Christ
[37:03] have put on Christ. There is neither Jew
[37:06] nor Greek. There's neither bond nor
[37:08] free. There's neither male nor female.
[37:10] For ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And
[37:13] if you be Christ, then you are Abraham's
[37:16] seed and is according to the promise.
[37:19] Amen. So, let's bow heads in a word of
[37:21] prayer this morning. If you ever need,
[37:22] you slip slip your hand up, say, "Lord,
[37:23] remember me." Amen. Gracious heavenly
[37:26] father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we
[37:28] can enjoy your love, enjoy your
[37:31] presence, enjoy your word. I just want
[37:33] to ask, Father, that Lord, you just just
[37:36] straighten up all my thinking, Lord.
[37:37] Calm down my spirit. May you have your
[37:39] way in the service today. We come to
[37:41] meet with you today, dear God. So, I
[37:43] pray, Father, all of our hearts would be
[37:45] open that you could come and minister to
[37:46] our needs. We love you so much, Lord. We
[37:49] just pray that you'll take the words
[37:50] we've read and may you anoint it to our
[37:52] hearts and make it live. And dear God,
[37:53] may be with everyone who's streaming.
[37:55] Dear God, may you be their abundant
[37:57] portion too. We commit them into your
[37:58] hands. We thank you for uh the ministers
[38:00] meeting on the weekend. Thank you all
[38:02] safely home. We praise you for that Lord
[38:04] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[38:07] bless you friends. You can have your
[38:08] seats this morning. So I want to speak
[38:09] about I want to speak about headship. Uh
[38:13] but not in a way where it's just a
[38:14] hierarchal thing but there's power in
[38:17] it. there's security, there's um there's
[38:20] stability and it brings out the best
[38:22] actually in those because you know when
[38:24] you when we look at here in Galatians
[38:26] where the apostle Paul we don't really
[38:28] think much of the magnitude of what he's
[38:30] saying here when it comes to where he
[38:32] speaks in verse 28 about how there's
[38:34] neither Jew nor Greek bond or free male
[38:37] or female but we're all one in Christ
[38:39] this was actually a monumental statement
[38:40] that he made because back in those days
[38:43] there was a big demarcation between
[38:44] gentile and non-gentile there was a big
[38:47] demarcation between slave or not, bond
[38:49] or free or male or female. There was a
[38:51] big hierarch you know um different
[38:54] status you know we could see this in the
[38:56] um you know because the Jews they they
[38:58] they were shocked at the very thought of
[39:00] of of the Gentiles obtaining mercy and
[39:03] knowing the Lord and coming under the
[39:05] covenant of God. they, you know, this
[39:06] was a big thing for them to to to
[39:09] realize that, you know, really the bride
[39:10] of Jesus Christ is a gentile bride as
[39:13] shown by Ruth and and and different um
[39:15] you know, shadows through the Old
[39:17] Testament. But and then even even if we
[39:19] um I don't have a diagram, but if we had
[39:21] a diagram of Herod's temple, there was
[39:23] uh different people could approach the
[39:25] Holy of Holies based on who they were.
[39:27] And so there was a court of the
[39:29] Gentiles, and the Gentiles could come to
[39:31] a certain distance, but they couldn't
[39:33] come as far as the Israelites. And then
[39:34] even with the Israelites, there was the
[39:36] court of the woman. So they could
[39:37] approach God with the Holy of Holies
[39:39] closer than the Gentiles ever could, but
[39:41] they couldn't go as far as the men,
[39:43] right? There was the court of the men,
[39:44] Israelite men. Then there was the court
[39:46] of the priests. And then there was the
[39:48] temple itself. So there was even in the
[39:50] how the temple was built. It was based
[39:52] on who you were by your birth is how far
[39:55] you close you could approach God. And
[39:57] and that was the system that was that
[39:59] that evolved. Now we none of us are
[40:02] secondass citizens in Christ.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; None of us doesn't matter what ethnicity
[40:08] we are. Doesn't matter what sex we are.
[40:10] Doesn't matter what age we are. We're
[40:12] all one in Christ. We're all actually on
[40:14] the equal level. Doesn't matter what
[40:16] gift you have. Doesn't matter what part
[40:18] of the body you are. You're part of the
[40:20] body. Right? So this is this is very
[40:22] important when it comes to headship
[40:24] because we realize now that God has
[40:27] because we are joint ears with Christ.
[40:29] Okay? So everything he fell heir to
[40:31] we're joint air with. So we're on equal
[40:34] level with him.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Right? And this is what the message has
[40:37] come to restore is the church is not a
[40:40] secondass citizen in the kingdom of
[40:41] heaven. We're not servants in the way
[40:43] that we're just paid and we don't know
[40:45] what's going on. No, we're part of the
[40:47] family. And because we are family, he
[40:49] sends his holy ghost into our hearts. We
[40:51] cry aba father. Right? So there's a big
[40:53] So, so the power of the blood has come
[40:56] to restore us back to the original
[40:58] position we're meant to be in, right?
[41:00] And now the enemy has always tried to
[41:03] get us out of the protection of God.
[41:05] Okay? This was his first tactic in the
[41:08] Garden of Eden where you know because
[41:10] before the fall, Eve wasn't called Eve.
[41:13] They were called Adam. They were one,
[41:16] &gt;&gt; right? They two different like God
[41:17] because we know Adam was male and female
[41:19] spirit form, right? Then God formed his
[41:22] body out of the dust of the earth and
[41:24] then put that man male and female into
[41:27] Adam. Okay? And then now when when um
[41:30] but with the animal creation, God did
[41:33] not put male and female say deer in one
[41:35] body then take take out the female deer
[41:37] out of the male, right? He just brought
[41:39] them out of the earth separately. But
[41:41] with man, it was it was male and female
[41:43] spirit, right? Into one body and then
[41:46] God took out the feminine part of Adam
[41:48] and made Eve. But before the fall, they
[41:50] were just called Adam, right? They were
[41:53] joint ears. There was no headship
[41:55] difference. They were co-equal, right?
[41:57] But then, so now the enemy came along
[41:59] and his purpose was to get them from
[42:01] under the protection of the word because
[42:04] basically the serpent was telling
[42:06] telling Eve, "Look, God's holding you
[42:08] back. There's more to this. You can be
[42:10] greater than what you are." and and and
[42:13] this this uh this thought that that that
[42:15] he put into her mind caused the whole
[42:18] fall, right? Because there's always
[42:20] because there's always, you know, people
[42:22] people are trying to restore equality in
[42:24] this day by pushing someone else down.
[42:27] So there's the feminist move wants to
[42:28] push the men down. Then there's now the
[42:29] counterfeminist move of the men wanting
[42:31] to push the woman down. And it but none
[42:33] of that brings people into their
[42:35] ordained position, right? It takes the
[42:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost takes the
[42:39] power of the blood to restore people
[42:41] back to what they're ordained to be.
[42:43] That's the only thing that can bring
[42:44] equality between races, between sexes,
[42:47] between anything. It's when you we come
[42:49] under the blood. That's the only way
[42:51] equality can happen. Right? But if you
[42:53] come under the banner of a church, then
[42:55] you know, you know, if you just have a
[42:56] church relationship with God, then
[42:59] there's no equality in that. Right?
[43:00] There's, you know, systematic religion
[43:02] has always made people secondass
[43:04] citizens. You know, it's maybe maybe the
[43:06] women are second class. They shouldn't
[43:08] be where where they don't talk about the
[43:10] Lord and they just sit and listen or
[43:11] they do washing dishes or whatever. But
[43:14] but we should all be able to have
[43:15] fellowship together.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Right? We're all part of the same body.
[43:19] Is this okay? We shouldn't be afraid of
[43:21] what if sister so and so has got a great
[43:22] deep revelation she wants to share in
[43:24] fellowship. Is that a problem?
[43:25] &gt;&gt; No. That's good,
[43:27] &gt;&gt; right? We're not just you none of us are
[43:29] second class here.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Some of you looking at me like, "What
[43:32] are you talking about? Can we not all
[43:34] talk about the Lord and his goodness?
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Can we not share what the Lord has put
[43:38] on our hearts?
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter who we are. Little child
[43:41] can come to me and say, "God showed me
[43:43] this. That's awesome.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." Sister, brother,
[43:46] whoever it is, you know. So, but see,
[43:48] because we're all one in Christ.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because by by his blood, he
[43:55] has restored us back as joint ears.
[43:57] We're not we're not secondass citizens.
[43:59] You see,
[44:01] we live in a day and hour where God has
[44:04] completely restored us under true
[44:06] headship of his word.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Okay? So now, what does that do for us?
[44:11] If we're if you know whose authority
[44:13] you're under, it gives you security,
[44:16] &gt;&gt; right? So if I was an ambassador for the
[44:18] United States, right, I could say things
[44:21] and do things that an ambassador from
[44:24] New Zealand could not do
[44:26] &gt;&gt; cuz I have no weight behind me as a
[44:27] Kiwi. Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; I've got no weapons. I've got no
[44:30] military force. I've got no trade. You
[44:32] know, I can't be throwing around
[44:33] tariffs. What if our prime minister
[44:35] stood up and said, "Look, I'm going to
[44:36] put all these tariffs on these nations."
[44:38] They'll think that's that's like a
[44:39] Saturday Night Live skit. They'll be
[44:40] laughing about it cuz there's no weight,
[44:43] right? Because the authority he's under
[44:46] or, you know, he is as the prime
[44:48] minister or an ambassador for New
[44:49] Zealand, that carries a different weight
[44:52] to how an ambassador from some
[44:54] superpower would would conduct
[44:56] themselves. So if a if an ambassador for
[44:59] you know so so someone who's under great
[45:01] authority has greater stability they're
[45:04] not afraid of how to conduct themselves
[45:07] they're not arro well they politicians
[45:08] are arrogant but you know but you
[45:10] shouldn't be arrogant about it you
[45:11] should realize no all that this nation
[45:13] so just if I was American all that
[45:15] America is and I'm an ambassador for
[45:17] America all that America is is behind me
[45:20] &gt;&gt; I speak well they have put words in my
[45:22] mouth to speak for them right because we
[45:25] have the same mind Okay. So now if you
[45:27] take that into the spiritual, you're
[45:28] going to realize all that heaven is is
[45:31] behind me, right? I am under I am under
[45:35] the headship of G the Lord Jesus Christ,
[45:37] his word, right? I'm not under the hip
[45:39] of a church
[45:40] &gt;&gt; or a or a man-made system. No, no. We're
[45:43] under the banner of we're under the
[45:45] protection of almighty God.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so if God is now, if he's
[45:50] taken me under his wings,
[45:52] &gt;&gt; which he has, then I can conduct myself
[45:55] with an assurance that he is on my side
[45:58] and he's protecting me. I don't need to
[46:00] worry and be stressed and be troubled
[46:02] about what the future holds. I know he
[46:04] holds my future. Amen. I know that he's
[46:07] been in my future. I know that he is in
[46:09] control and I can rest in whatever state
[46:11] I'm in right now. I can be content
[46:13] knowing, God, you have my best interest
[46:15] in mind. Lord, you're interested in
[46:18] molding my character to be like your
[46:20] character. Lord, all things are working
[46:22] together for my good.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, you can only say
[46:26] that if you know what the end date of a
[46:27] of a trial is." No, you don't.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; We can stand here with such assurance
[46:32] and confidence because I'm not trying to
[46:34] hold my life together.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Right? We got to realize, you know, we
[46:37] got to come to a place in our walk we
[46:39] realize, Lord, you're my king,
[46:41] &gt;&gt; right? You're not an errand boy. You're
[46:43] not a lucky rabbit's foot I pull out and
[46:45] rub if times get trouble. No, you're my
[46:47] king and you have not pushed me down
[46:49] into some corner and I'm just some
[46:52] secondass citizen in the back of nowhere
[46:53] and I've got no rights. I've got no
[46:55] ability. I've got nothing. No, you have
[46:57] lifted me up
[46:58] &gt;&gt; to be joint hes with you that I know
[47:01] your heart. I know your mind. Amen. I
[47:03] know your thoughts towards me are the
[47:05] thoughts of peace. They'll come to an
[47:07] expected end. Right? And we know his
[47:09] thoughts can't change. God can't have a
[47:11] new thought. His thoughts are eternal.
[47:13] His thoughts are real. His thoughts do
[47:15] not change based on new information.
[47:17] Right? So his thoughts towards you
[47:18] cannot change based on what you do.
[47:21] Amen. You say, "Well, I've had a bad
[47:23] week." His thoughts don't change towards
[47:24] you. You say, "Well, I've stuffed up big
[47:26] time. I've sinned." His thoughts do not
[47:27] change towards you. Amen. That doesn't
[47:29] mean we're indifferent and just continue
[47:31] on. No, we say, "Lord, forgive me. Wash
[47:32] me in your blood, Lord. Change my heart,
[47:34] Lord. I'm sorry, Lord." But you see, his
[47:36] thoughts towards you cannot change. So
[47:38] if his thoughts towards you, you're my
[47:40] beloved. Amen. You're the apple of my
[47:42] eye. Amen. You're the you're the very
[47:44] purpose of of of of existence right now
[47:47] is my heart is towards you. Amen. I care
[47:49] about what you're going through. I'm
[47:51] mindful. I'm here with you in this
[47:52] trial. If you only knew the gold that is
[47:55] being being being fashioned in your life
[47:57] of my character and you you know see he
[47:59] doesn't he doesn't just he's not
[48:01] indifferent. Remember this is not some
[48:03] indifferent chain of command where we've
[48:05] got to get an interview and you know got
[48:07] to get a time and got to you know maybe
[48:09] see him. No, his ear is always open.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; To you and I. This is not some distance
[48:14] thing of, "Well, I'm down here and he's
[48:16] the way up there and how can I ever get
[48:17] an interview with the king?" No, his ear
[48:19] is always open.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You You got to realize that, you
[48:22] know, like even brother Brmond asked a
[48:24] question, who's got more authority with
[48:26] God? An archangel who never sinned or or
[48:30] a or a or a sinner who's just given
[48:32] their lives to the Lord's just come
[48:33] under the blood?
[48:35] Not the archangel.
[48:38] It's it's the believer who's become a
[48:40] believer
[48:41] &gt;&gt; because remember whenever we begin to
[48:43] pray to the Lord not yeah I mean he can
[48:45] talk to everyone at once. He never gets
[48:46] overwhelmed you know by he's never that
[48:49] way but you know just just to illustrate
[48:51] it's like you know the angels are
[48:52] talking to him the great throne room of
[48:54] God and there's the archangels and all
[48:56] these things and they're all talking
[48:57] they're having a meeting or whatever
[48:58] more but then now but then now one of us
[49:01] begins to talk to him we're in our
[49:03] brokenness in our desperation we're
[49:04] thinking God do you even hear my prayer
[49:06] and what does he say? Shh.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Quiet. Angels. My daughter's talking to
[49:10] me.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. My son's talking to me. Basically
[49:13] saying, angels, they're more important
[49:15] to me than you. And because they're part
[49:17] of me. They're my family. They're my
[49:19] attributes upon the earth. Amen. They're
[49:21] more than just human beings. No, they're
[49:23] part of me.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so when we begin to talk to
[49:26] him, everything else has got to be
[49:27] quiet. The angels have got to be silent
[49:29] because his focus is on you.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You ever had someone that's so
[49:34] important in your life that other people
[49:35] are talking, but when they speak, your
[49:38] focus goes on that person
[49:40] &gt;&gt; because you love them. You want more for
[49:41] them. You want to, you know, you want to
[49:43] hear what they've got to say. Your
[49:44] attention is just on them. That's how
[49:46] God times out by a billion infinities
[49:48] and that's how God feels about you,
[49:50] right? So, you got to realize that that
[49:51] that God being God being our king, he's
[49:54] being supreme over us. He hasn't he
[49:56] hasn't pushed us down to some place
[49:58] where basically he says just follow this
[50:00] and you'll be fine. No, it's a it's a
[50:03] love relationship.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a relationship of care. And
[50:07] we got to realize if heaven's behind me
[50:09] because like the Bible says Paul would
[50:11] say, "If God be for us, who can who can
[50:13] be against us?" Right? As it says in
[50:15] Isaiah that no weapon formed against me
[50:17] shall prosper.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, so if so, if we have that
[50:20] confidence and and I believe we should,
[50:22] God's for me. He's not against me. He
[50:25] was for me before the foundation of the
[50:27] world when he wrote my name on the
[50:28] Lamb's Book of Life, right? and he can't
[50:30] have a new thought about me. So if he's
[50:32] for me, he's for me. That's it.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can't change his thinking like,
[50:36] "Oh, I made a mistake by revealing
[50:38] myself to that person." No, he wanted to
[50:41] do it. And he knew our humanity. He knew
[50:44] our frailty. He knew how we're built,
[50:46] right? He gave you your personality for
[50:48] a purpose, right? None of our
[50:51] personalities are disabilities,
[50:53] &gt;&gt; right? He made you a certain way. He
[50:55] wanted you to be how you are.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he didn't want you how you
[50:59] were, he would have changed you. I mean,
[51:01] he would have be no, he would have made
[51:02] you different,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; right? So, if you're quiet, we quiet. If
[51:06] you're loud, you're loud. Extroverted,
[51:07] introverted, flaggmatic, whatever it is,
[51:10] whatever label people have made. Just
[51:12] just be happy to be God made you you,
[51:15] &gt;&gt; right? And he doesn't hold it against
[51:17] you. He's not like, "Why is that person
[51:19] always so quiet? Why can't they be this
[51:22] way?" No, he wants you to be you,
[51:25] &gt;&gt; right? He is He wants you to be you. He
[51:27] made you a certain way that you can be
[51:30] you in Christ the you can only be that
[51:33] way. No one else can be you. No one can
[51:34] take your place how he wants you to be
[51:37] in his body. So because so so you got to
[51:39] see I'm hopefully this is all making
[51:41] sense. But you know if he's our king and
[51:43] this is how he feels towards us. How
[51:45] does it make you feel? It doesn't make
[51:47] me feel like I'm just scraping on thin
[51:49] ice, stepping on thin ice. Doesn't make
[51:52] me feel like am I ever going to get
[51:53] anywhere? No, it gives me a confidence.
[51:57] Lord, you built me for a purpose. You
[51:58] loved me when I can't even love myself.
[52:01] Amen. When I was yet your I was your
[52:02] enemy, Lord, and you died for me.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was against you, Lord.
[52:06] Everything that I was my first birth
[52:08] actually made me at emity with you. But
[52:11] you bridge the chasm. You didn't even
[52:13] just bridge it. You annihilated it by
[52:14] the blood of Jesus Christ. And now we're
[52:16] joint hes with him.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? So, you know, we
[52:21] got to I think if we could just look at
[52:24] this as not a it's it's not an
[52:26] impairment. It's not a restriction. It's
[52:29] a liberty.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be conformed to anything
[52:33] of this world. I don't have to put up a
[52:36] facade. I can just be me.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; If I'm doing good, I'm doing good. If
[52:41] I'm struggling, well, I'm struggling.
[52:43] I'm having good day, I'm having a good
[52:44] day. Bad day, that's fine. You know, it
[52:46] doesn't change how he thinks towards
[52:48] you. Cuz what is the expected end? his
[52:51] the expected end that that was spoke
[52:52] about in Jeremiah is that that expected
[52:54] end is will be made in his image
[52:56] redeemed dancing on streets of gold for
[53:00] all eternity.
[53:02] That's your expected end. Remember a
[53:04] trial is not anyone's expected end. You
[53:07] know, it's never the end. It's never
[53:08] like, oh, God just pushes, oh, because
[53:10] you did this, therefore you're going to
[53:11] go through this. Not necessarily. No.
[53:14] God has ordained our footsteps. Amen. He
[53:17] has he is in complete. Remember, he's
[53:19] our king. He's supreme, right? And he
[53:21] doesn't call you to push you around and
[53:24] push you down.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; That is not our God. That is not the God
[53:27] of the Bible that I know. No, he calls
[53:29] us to lift us up
[53:31] &gt;&gt; into heavenly places to be joint ears
[53:33] with him. Amen. That we realize that
[53:35] we're not just we didn't just come in
[53:36] here by accident. None of us are here by
[53:38] chance this morning. But God pre-planned
[53:40] our lives. Amen. That a certain season
[53:42] his word would come across our path. And
[53:44] it's not to push you down and make you
[53:46] feel like you're no hope. But no, it's
[53:47] to lift you up. saying, "Look, you're an
[53:49] overcomer. You don't know what you are,
[53:51] but I'm going to show you what you are."
[53:53] Amen. This is what headship does. It
[53:54] lifts us up to make us realize what
[53:56] we're built to be. And it's not by our
[53:58] humanity, but it's by his supreme grace.
[54:00] Amen. That causes us to realize, "No, we
[54:03] are part of his word." I mean, we're
[54:05] part of him. Like when when Eve was
[54:06] brought before Adam, you know, he said,
[54:08] "You're bone of my bone, flesh of my
[54:10] flesh." He he he couldn't say that about
[54:12] any any other creature in existence cuz
[54:14] he named them all. But when he saw her,
[54:16] he said, "You're part of me." Amen. And
[54:18] that's what the Lord is saying with us
[54:19] now. He's trying to get us to see that
[54:21] we're part of him.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going on here. Hold
[54:25] on. We're good. I just got unhooked.
[54:29] Okay, we're good. We're good. Yeah.
[54:31] Yeah. Thank you. We're good. Maybe I'll
[54:33] just take this off.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see, this is this is the
[54:36] whole crux of the thing where where
[54:38] where Paul would say, you know, we're
[54:39] all one in Christ. There's no one
[54:42] secondass. It doesn't matter if you're a
[54:44] if if you're been a believer 5 seconds
[54:46] or 50 years.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; You're all the same.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've got to grow into
[54:52] something first, then I've got then you
[54:54] then God will hear my prayers." No way.
[54:56] Amen. Cuz when you were on the other
[54:57] side of the chasm and you called upon
[54:59] his name, he came to you. Amen. Whatever
[55:01] pit you came out of, he reached down his
[55:03] hand. Way for you. Amen. So there's
[55:06] Hallelujah.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[55:11] Amen. So he says here now even so when
[55:13] we were children were in bondage under
[55:14] the elements of the world but in the
[55:16] fullness of the time was come God sent
[55:18] forth the son made of a woman made under
[55:20] the law to redeem them which were under
[55:21] the law that we might receive the
[55:23] adoption of sons that's the placing of
[55:25] sons and because we are sons God sent
[55:27] has sent forth the spirit into our
[55:29] hearts crying abba father wherefore
[55:31] we're no longer a servant but a son and
[55:33] if a son then an heir of God through
[55:36] Christ amen so so we we we we fall heir
[55:40] to everything that he's done.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. This like I said this probably
[55:44] over a month ago, brother said, you
[55:46] know, I aired it. I didn't deserve
[55:47] nothing, but I aired it all. Amen. Why?
[55:50] Because we are joint ears. You see, like
[55:51] anyone anyone who's truly married, all
[55:54] that they have is their spouses. And the
[55:57] other way around, it's not this is mine,
[55:59] this is yours, and don't touch my stuff.
[56:02] That's not being joint air.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; I mean, it doesn't matter the wealth or
[56:05] lack of whatever, but everything he is,
[56:07] she becomes,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; right? and everything that she is
[56:09] becomes his, right? That because they
[56:12] become one where they're no longer known
[56:14] as a couple, but you always got to say
[56:16] their names together because they're
[56:18] one.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; So when you think of one, you think of
[56:19] the other, right? You think of brother
[56:21] Impo, you think of Sister Sepe. Think of
[56:23] Brother Phil, you think of Sister
[56:24] Belinda. It's just natural. You think
[56:25] because why? They're one, right? You
[56:27] think of Shirley, you think of
[56:28] Christian, you think of me and the other
[56:29] way around. We're irrespon.
[56:34] It's the same thing with us and the
[56:36] Lord. Amen. When you think of him, you
[56:37] should think of your brother and sister.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Because they're one, right?
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're fallen air to all
[56:43] things. It's not, you know, because this
[56:45] is what you know, God God has to me to
[56:48] me headship shows that, you know, God
[56:50] doesn't keep back any of his treasures
[56:53] &gt;&gt; cuz all that he is, we're fallen to.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. All of his power, all of his
[56:59] mercy, all of his forgiveness, amen, all
[57:02] of his grace. Yeah. Every redemptive
[57:05] blessing that he has that he is, we're
[57:07] falling air to. All of his attributes,
[57:10] amen, are ours this morning. Amen. He's
[57:12] not just our father. He's my savior cuz
[57:15] that's part of him. Amen. He's my
[57:17] redeemer cuz that's an attribute of his.
[57:19] Amen. He's my high priest. Amen.
[57:20] Actively interceding on my behalf. Amen.
[57:23] With his own blood. Amen. Standing in
[57:24] the gap between Hallelujah. for me. Why?
[57:27] Because he is my high priest. He is my
[57:30] mediator. Amen. He's my intercessor.
[57:32] He's my guide. Because if I become part
[57:34] of him, I fall an air to all that he is.
[57:37] Amen. He's my provider. Jehovah Gyra.
[57:41] Amen. And he proves these things over
[57:43] and over again. Amen. To show that he's
[57:45] not just given you part of himself, he's
[57:48] given you all of his word, all of his
[57:50] self. Amen. So he's he's my comforter.
[57:53] He's my guide. He's my counselor. Cuz
[57:55] that's all of his attributes, right?
[57:57] He's my king. He's my defender.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's mighty in battle. Amen. He's
[58:02] He's a line of the tribe of Judah. Amen.
[58:04] He's not some weak little hippie kind of
[58:06] guy. No, he's fierce in battle. Amen.
[58:09] He's my shield. He's my buckler. He's my
[58:11] defense. He's my strength giver. Amen.
[58:13] He's my all and all. Everything that he
[58:15] is, I have fallen air to.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; He doesn't just give part of himself.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; If this was just a working relationship,
[58:22] then he'd just be king. or he'd just be
[58:25] father or he'd be I don't know something
[58:28] that's just like a working relationship.
[58:30] He's my husband.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; He's my all in all.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; He's my sustainer.
[58:38] Amen. There's probably many more that
[58:40] you could, you know, we could think of
[58:41] right now. But you got to see all that
[58:43] he is. We're fallen air, too. Amen. Why?
[58:46] Cuz I've come under the shadow of his
[58:48] great wings. I don't need to try and
[58:50] push someone else down to get something
[58:52] for him or with him. I don't need to
[58:54] push down anyone or anything to get
[58:57] something. Just like the, you know,
[58:58] there's all these kind of movements
[59:00] going on in the world, you know, and
[59:02] then they're going to push down someone
[59:03] else to get what they think is
[59:04] rightfully theirs. That's not
[59:06] Christianity. Let them do what they do.
[59:09] We're full and air to all things.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even even where where
[59:16] Peter would be writing here in the um
[59:19] here in the New Testament, he'd be
[59:21] writing to husbands to you know likewise
[59:24] ye husbands dwell with them according to
[59:26] knowledge giving honor unto your wife as
[59:28] unto the weaker vessel and as being hes
[59:30] together of the grace of life that your
[59:32] prayers be not hindered. The Bible in
[59:34] basic English says, "But who has an
[59:37] equal part in the heritage of the grace
[59:39] of life?" Because back then the Jewish
[59:41] people, the woman's testimony held less
[59:44] weight than a man's. And in some courts,
[59:46] they weren't even heard. So they were
[59:48] secondass citizens, right? But he's
[59:51] saying, "No, you're no longer that way.
[59:53] Your joint is together. You have equal
[59:55] part in the heritage of the grace of
[59:57] life."
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. To me, that's immensely powerful.
[1:00:02] Amen. And it doesn't matter who we are.
[1:00:04] We all have equal part in the heritage
[1:00:07] of the grace of I just like that we got
[1:00:09] equal part. I don't have a minor part.
[1:00:10] It's not like you cut a piece of cake
[1:00:12] and someone gets a bigger portion, I get
[1:00:14] a smaller portion. We all get the same
[1:00:16] portion.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:20] Hallelujah. Now,
[1:00:24] praise the Lord. If you don't mind, just
[1:00:26] going to read this here. Who's the image
[1:00:27] of the invisible God, the firstborn of
[1:00:29] every creature. For by him are all
[1:00:30] things created that are in heaven um and
[1:00:34] that are in earth, visible, invisible,
[1:00:35] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[1:00:37] principalities or powers. All things
[1:00:39] were created by him and for him. And he
[1:00:41] is before all things, and by him all
[1:00:43] things consist. And he is the head of
[1:00:45] the body, the church, who is the
[1:00:46] beginning of the firstborn from the
[1:00:48] dead, that in all things he might have
[1:00:50] the preeminence. Right? So if he is if
[1:00:53] so if he is our head and we're his body
[1:00:57] a living body doesn't have a separated
[1:00:59] head from a body.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; I've never seen I mean you can actually
[1:01:02] apparently you can cut off a chicken's
[1:01:04] head and they can run around and still
[1:01:05] live somehow. But we ain't some headless
[1:01:08] chicken
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; this morning. We ain't some headless
[1:01:10] body trying to work out how to be and
[1:01:13] how to be a Christian and how to live an
[1:01:14] overcoming life. No, we receive the mind
[1:01:17] of Christ. A means but where his head is
[1:01:20] there his body is. Amen. So his So you
[1:01:23] realize that his head I mean his body is
[1:01:26] far above all things.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Remember far above all things. So you
[1:01:30] know you say well I'm an insignificant
[1:01:32] part of the body. It doesn't matter if
[1:01:34] you're the skin on the little toe.
[1:01:36] You're still on the head of the devil
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; right? Your position is still above your
[1:01:40] enemy right? Not below. Not equal with
[1:01:42] but you're above. You're on top of him.
[1:01:44] I mean he belongs under your feet. You
[1:01:46] say well I'm just a toenail. You're
[1:01:48] still above him.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Right? You got to realize this is the
[1:01:50] position that we have been given. Amen.
[1:01:52] That it's not. See, it's not God and
[1:01:54] Satan have not equal power. This is not
[1:01:58] some wrestling match and somehow God can
[1:02:00] overcome the He's already conquered
[1:02:02] hell, death, and the grave. I mean, our
[1:02:04] head is supreme. Amen. In every way, in
[1:02:07] every ability. The devil doesn't have
[1:02:09] the keys to his own house anymore. He's
[1:02:11] nothing but a bluff. Amen. But you got
[1:02:13] to realize now. You got to realize that
[1:02:16] he's nothing but a bluff. Amen. What did
[1:02:18] the opening of the seals do? Expose
[1:02:20] Satan. And what is when the first seal
[1:02:22] opened that that white horse rider went
[1:02:24] forth and it's a deception riding forth.
[1:02:26] Right? It's not the King of Kings and
[1:02:28] Lord of Lords riding forth on a white
[1:02:30] horse because you read Revelations 19,
[1:02:32] the symbology there. That's the Lord
[1:02:34] riding.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Sharp twitched sword comes out of his
[1:02:36] mouth. He's called the word of God. He's
[1:02:38] got many crowns, vesture dipped in the
[1:02:41] blood of God, right?
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; You know, with his own blood. But then
[1:02:44] in Revelation 6, the first seal, it's
[1:02:46] just a white horse given a bow, no
[1:02:49] arrows, and a crown's given to him.
[1:02:50] They're not the same being,
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; right? But when the enemy's exposes that
[1:02:54] Antichrist spirit riding forth, he's
[1:02:56] given a bow and no arrows.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine fighting, let's just go
[1:03:00] back to medieval times. You've got a
[1:03:02] sword and a shield, you got armor, and a
[1:03:04] guy runs at you with a bow and no
[1:03:05] arrows. He says, "I'm going to kill
[1:03:06] you."
[1:03:08] You wouldn't be afraid of that guy.
[1:03:11] He You wouldn't. You say, "You don't
[1:03:12] have any arrows for your bow, buddy.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; I've got a sword and a shield. I've got
[1:03:16] the I got the sword of the spirit and
[1:03:19] the, you know, shield of faith and the
[1:03:20] helmet of salvation. I got the full
[1:03:22] armor of God on." And you're coming at
[1:03:23] me with just a bow.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; But you see, if he can intimidate you,
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; then you can think, man, this guy's got
[1:03:30] something. He can get me with that
[1:03:31] thing. But he's revealed as a bluff.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; He's revealed as just all talk.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will try and bluff you and
[1:03:38] intimidate you. think you're never going
[1:03:40] to get out of this and you're trapped in
[1:03:41] this mind battle and this is just how
[1:03:42] your life has to be. He's bluffing you.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; He's bluffing you. He doesn't know the
[1:03:47] future.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Our Lord knows the future. Amen. You got
[1:03:51] to realize that as the seasons change,
[1:03:53] you know, naturally, so spiritual
[1:03:55] seasons change. Amen. We, you know, grow
[1:03:57] up and we go through different seasons
[1:03:58] of life, we don't forever stay Peter
[1:04:01] Pans as children,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; right? We don't, our lives are never
[1:04:05] actually a constant. You know, sure
[1:04:08] there's some times of life we wish we
[1:04:10] could go back to. But you got to
[1:04:11] realize, you know, many people they want
[1:04:12] to go back to their childhood, but they
[1:04:14] just had a childlike mind back then.
[1:04:16] What if you had an adult mind back in
[1:04:18] that same situation, then you'd realize
[1:04:20] everything that's going on in your
[1:04:21] family and everything that's going on in
[1:04:23] the world. All these things, you think,
[1:04:24] man, actually, I don't want to go back
[1:04:26] there.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; But with a childlike thinking, you
[1:04:28] think, man, that was idyllic and
[1:04:29] perfect, but you just had limited
[1:04:31] thinking with that thing.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; And so, we can't ever say, well, I just
[1:04:34] want my life to be the same. Now, we're
[1:04:36] always growing. We're always changing.
[1:04:38] Amen. The season is never the same all
[1:04:41] the time. Amen. So, you got to realize,
[1:04:42] well, you say, "I'm going through a
[1:04:43] winter time and it's hard and it's cold
[1:04:46] and I'm there's a difficult life and
[1:04:48] things are going." You got to realize
[1:04:49] spring is coming. Amen. Spring is
[1:04:52] coming. Amen. Summer is coming. Amen.
[1:04:54] There's light, there's temper, there's
[1:04:55] heat, there's warmth, there's a change
[1:04:57] of season on its way. We're not always
[1:04:59] stuck in winter. Praise the Lord. I'm
[1:05:02] not a snow bunny. I like warmth, you
[1:05:04] know. But you see, you you got to
[1:05:05] realize that, you know, but you say,
[1:05:06] "Well, this seems to be a long season,
[1:05:08] but it's going to end.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; The season's going to end. The trial's
[1:05:12] going to end. The trouble's going to
[1:05:13] end. The questions are going to end.
[1:05:15] The, you know, the, you know, all the
[1:05:17] the things you're going through." And
[1:05:19] the reason we can say that is because
[1:05:21] our king has shown in nature seasons
[1:05:25] don't stay the same.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; And we just have to trust him and keep
[1:05:29] walking through it and the season will
[1:05:32] change. Yeah,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. And when the season
[1:05:36] changes, praise the Lord.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Right? That's like like I was talking to
[1:05:40] Christine this morning. I said, "Look,
[1:05:41] this accident, your recovery, God could
[1:05:44] do it like this."
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Right? On my Robin here, the tumor
[1:05:48] that's gone out of her throat just like
[1:05:50] that. Different things. God has
[1:05:52] miraculously healed people, right? But
[1:05:54] if it doesn't, if it's not that, it'll
[1:05:56] be a length of time. Well, how long is
[1:05:58] it going to take? As long as God wants
[1:06:00] it to,
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; right? You say, "Well, what does it
[1:06:04] matter how long or short?" It's as long
[1:06:06] as he wants it to,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; right? Because our God said, "I'm I'll
[1:06:10] never leave you nor forsake you. You go
[1:06:12] through the waters, go through the fire.
[1:06:14] You won't drown. You won't be burned.
[1:06:15] They won't touch you. You will go
[1:06:16] through all these things.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And it's however long he wants it to be
[1:06:20] is how long he wants it to be." And we
[1:06:22] trust him every step of the way.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he he knows how long he
[1:06:27] wants it to be. Does it If it's long,
[1:06:29] does it mean he's more displeased?
[1:06:30] Anything? No way. It's got nothing to do
[1:06:33] with it.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; But he's ordained a length of time
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; and we can just keep walking, keep
[1:06:38] praising him, keep trusting him. God is
[1:06:41] in control. The season won't always be
[1:06:45] this way. Life won't always because the
[1:06:47] devil, what does he want to do? He wants
[1:06:48] you to think your head doesn't love you.
[1:06:52] God, the Lord doesn't love you. He
[1:06:53] doesn't care. He's not interested.
[1:06:55] That's why you're going through what
[1:06:56] you're going through. That ain't true.
[1:07:00] He does care.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; He does love you.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Remember, his love is shown by election.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; You know, because even Israel would ask
[1:07:07] in the book of Malachi, "Lord, how do we
[1:07:09] know that you love us?" This not
[1:07:10] verbatim, but you go read it. He says,
[1:07:12] "Well, he said he said before um Jacob
[1:07:14] and Esau were born. I loved one and I
[1:07:17] hated the other one."
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; So, his love was shown in election
[1:07:20] before they did anything, the Apostle
[1:07:22] Paul picks it up, right? So, his love
[1:07:23] was shown in election. It's not based on
[1:07:25] what happens in life,
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; right? It's just a grabag of life
[1:07:29] happens.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't mean that with any
[1:07:33] indifference or anything, but you know,
[1:07:35] things happen to us. They just happen to
[1:07:36] us.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Well, what's the reason? All things work
[1:07:39] together for good.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. God never stands us up with a
[1:07:42] standup meeting at the start of the day
[1:07:43] and say, "Look, this is what you're
[1:07:44] going to go through. This is the time
[1:07:46] frame. This is what you're going to
[1:07:47] face." No, we just have to trust him and
[1:07:49] walk by faith that he is molding us,
[1:07:51] shaping us. He is dealing in our lives.
[1:07:53] Amen. He is working everything for our
[1:07:56] good.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because he's the head of the
[1:08:00] body.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; He's my headship. Amen. I'm under
[1:08:03] supreme authority.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has my best interest in mind.
[1:08:07] Praise the Lord. But you see, it's when
[1:08:10] we want to do our own thing, that's when
[1:08:13] danger happens. See, Vashi wanted Vashi
[1:08:16] was um Vashi was having her own feast
[1:08:19] and then the king called her and then
[1:08:21] she said no. Right? She was she was
[1:08:24] doing her own thing. She refused to come
[1:08:25] by the king's commandment. But you see,
[1:08:28] both Esther and Vashi actually had the
[1:08:30] same benefits.
[1:08:32] But one wanted to do her own thing.
[1:08:34] Esther wanted to do the king's thing. If
[1:08:37] I can say it like that, right? And then
[1:08:39] even even now the king loved Esther
[1:08:42] above all the women
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; and she obtained grace and favor in his
[1:08:46] sight.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Can you put yourself there today?
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; You're loved. If that's all you get out
[1:08:52] of this, you're greatly loved. Amen. You
[1:08:55] found fa you found you've obtained grace
[1:08:57] and favor in his sight. Well, is it
[1:09:00] something I said? Is it something I did?
[1:09:02] No. You're part of him,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; right? You're an attribute of him. Amen.
[1:09:07] He He thought of you before the
[1:09:08] foundation of the world. Amen. His grace
[1:09:10] and his love is great upon us.
[1:09:14] Amen. Praise the Lord. And then even
[1:09:17] it's amazing, you know, when the, you
[1:09:18] know, when Esther comes in before the
[1:09:19] king, he says, "What will thou queen
[1:09:22] Esther? What is thy request?" And you
[1:09:23] know he asked this question multiple
[1:09:25] times. What is your request? It shall be
[1:09:28] given thee to half of the kingdom. And
[1:09:30] that doesn't mean he's going to split
[1:09:32] the kingdom. It means every half of the
[1:09:34] kingdom. You're joint air with me.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, so the king's always
[1:09:39] asking Esther, what is your need? What
[1:09:42] is your request? You got to realize who
[1:09:44] you are, Esther. I mean, you're not
[1:09:46] you're not just a queen. You're not just
[1:09:48] part of the household. No, he loved her
[1:09:50] above all the women. Amen.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so she's always, you know, you
[1:09:56] know, he's asking her, "What is your
[1:09:57] request?" Or, "Can I ask things?" Yeah.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Hey, if God's on your side, you should
[1:10:03] have big plans.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You We receive not because we ask
[1:10:07] not.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And we are. And you know, and we receive
[1:10:11] not because we ask a miss. Well, how do
[1:10:13] you know if you're asking a miss? Well,
[1:10:14] how do you know you're asking right?
[1:10:15] It's got to be according to his word,
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; right? But you see now she she was given
[1:10:21] this you know it'll be given up to the
[1:10:23] half the kingdom
[1:10:25] and then because she was joint ears with
[1:10:27] with the king now she was afraid to go
[1:10:29] in before the king. I haven't been
[1:10:31] invited 30 days was her reply to Mori
[1:10:33] when Mori was pleading with her. You
[1:10:36] must go and intercede for our people cuz
[1:10:38] Hmon's had this law written and you know
[1:10:40] she was but she was like listen I've
[1:10:42] been invited for 30 days and it's death
[1:10:44] to go into the prince of the king. She
[1:10:46] forgot that she had obtained grace and
[1:10:48] favor
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; in his sight.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; So she was actually the one that he
[1:10:53] would have wanted in the in the throne
[1:10:55] room.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Right now here's you now, right? This is
[1:10:59] this is how our Lord thinks about you.
[1:11:01] But you see, so she was afraid to go
[1:11:03] into the presence of the very one that
[1:11:05] loved her.
[1:11:08] She had the wrong understanding of
[1:11:09] headship.
[1:11:11] Would he listen to me? I'm not welcome.
[1:11:13] I've been invited. We're called to go
[1:11:16] boldly before his throne.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have been, I believe, awakened
[1:11:20] to the fact that we can boldly go before
[1:11:22] his throne. We have a right to call upon
[1:11:24] heaven. Amen. We have a right to call
[1:11:26] upon our king in any time. Amen. You
[1:11:29] know, like Jesus would tell the parable
[1:11:31] of the unjust judge. It was that widow
[1:11:33] woman and you know, basically that woman
[1:11:34] just kept bugging that judge until
[1:11:36] eventually the judge gave in and said,
[1:11:38] "Well, I'm just going to fix this case
[1:11:39] because she's wearing me out." Now, our
[1:11:42] God is not an unjust judge. You know, he
[1:11:44] doesn't he's not afraid of us wearing
[1:11:46] him out, but he's just basically saying,
[1:11:48] "Go and ask. Him that seeketh findeth.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Him that knockketh.
[1:11:54] Knocketh." Not just knock, knockketh.
[1:11:56] It'll be opened.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this this is what, you
[1:11:59] know, he's trying to get us to see.
[1:12:00] Look, don't just go one time, get an
[1:12:03] answer. Him that seeketh findeth. He
[1:12:06] doesn't get weary with you asking him.
[1:12:08] He wants you to come to him. Amen.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I just want to I just
[1:12:17] want to um I won't be too much longer.
[1:12:19] As I said, I haven't um
[1:12:23] it's the same thing. It's the same thing
[1:12:24] with Ruth because if we if we realize
[1:12:26] whose headship we come under, then we
[1:12:29] realize that we can there's power within
[1:12:32] that that redemption can come to our
[1:12:34] loved ones. Okay. So Ruth Ruth would be
[1:12:37] instructed by Naomi to go to where Boaz
[1:12:41] is laying there on the you know the
[1:12:42] barley harvest and he's asleep there and
[1:12:45] go go to his feet laid down and then he
[1:12:47] will tell you what he's going to do you
[1:12:48] know you know what's going to transpire
[1:12:50] now Naomi lost property in Israel right
[1:12:54] she that property and Naomi that needed
[1:12:56] to be a restoration
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; and the only way that restoration could
[1:13:00] come is by Ruth coming under headship of
[1:13:03] Boaz being united with Boaz All right.
[1:13:05] And so now Boaz being a type of Christ.
[1:13:07] Ruth being a type of the bride is that
[1:13:10] Ruth did not become a secondass citizen
[1:13:12] in Boaz's household, she became Mrs.
[1:13:16] Boaz,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; right? So everything that he had, she
[1:13:19] fell he too, right? After they got
[1:13:22] married, she didn't go back and um was
[1:13:24] gleaning in the field anymore buying the
[1:13:26] reapers
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; because she owned the field. Right?
[1:13:29] Those reapers weren't actually her
[1:13:31] leadership now. They were working for
[1:13:33] her, right? because she wasn't gleaning
[1:13:35] in the field trying to survive. Imagine
[1:13:37] if the day after the wedding or the
[1:13:38] honeymoon she she goes back, you know,
[1:13:40] she goes back out to the field and
[1:13:42] starts gleaning again. Those servants
[1:13:45] would think she does not understand who
[1:13:47] she is and how much and sadly how many
[1:13:51] times we just say, "Well, I'm just
[1:13:52] surviving and I'm just scraping through
[1:13:54] and, you know, trying to find a little
[1:13:55] blessing here, blessing there." When we
[1:13:56] realize every redemptive blessing is
[1:13:58] ours,
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; right? That we don't need to just just
[1:14:00] just survive. No, we're overcomers.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; All this, every divine promise of God by
[1:14:06] the blood of Jesus Christ is yours.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, so she came under,
[1:14:13] she came under his headship.
[1:14:16] And then what happened? Naomi's land was
[1:14:19] restored. Naomi was redeemed. And then,
[1:14:22] of course, Ruth was no longer a
[1:14:24] Moabitis, but she became Mrs. Boaz.
[1:14:27] Amen. Because in the law, remember, a
[1:14:29] Moabitete could not come into the
[1:14:30] congregation of Israel. But grace always
[1:14:32] overshadows the law and it brings a
[1:14:35] restoration and redemption. Amen. So you
[1:14:37] think, well, legally, I've I've I've
[1:14:38] I've ruined my chances with God. I've
[1:14:41] done too much wrong. I've broken every
[1:14:43] commandment. No, but that's when grace
[1:14:45] steps in.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's always room for
[1:14:48] restoration and redemption. Amen. Why?
[1:14:50] Cuz grace overshadows the law. Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brings redemption. To me, this
[1:14:56] is this is this is my king.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; This is the headship of commander. Amen.
[1:15:01] There's I can't fall too far, go too
[1:15:04] wrong, be in sin too long for him not to
[1:15:06] find me and bring me back
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; to where I was ordained to be.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:15] So now Jesus made this statement. He
[1:15:18] says, "Then Jesus uh uh then said Jesus
[1:15:20] to the Jews which believed on him, if
[1:15:22] you continue in my word, then you are my
[1:15:24] disciples indeed, and you shall know the
[1:15:26] truth, and the truth shall make you
[1:15:28] free." Amen. So the truth has a power in
[1:15:30] it to free us. Amen. So now if we
[1:15:34] realize now that God is our head, God's
[1:15:36] our king, that we're his bride. Amen.
[1:15:39] We're not a servant. We're not just
[1:15:40] struggling along. We're not maybe we're
[1:15:42] not a church member. There's no church
[1:15:43] members here, right? But we are sons and
[1:15:46] daughters of the most high God. And the
[1:15:48] devil's under our feet. That should free
[1:15:49] us from his lie. Free us from his grip.
[1:15:52] I mean, because the devil wants you to
[1:15:54] think, like I said, boy, he's nothing
[1:15:55] but a bluff. But if you believe him, it
[1:15:58] gives him power in your life. So you
[1:16:00] give him as much power as you let him
[1:16:02] have.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Right? So if you have in your mind,
[1:16:05] there's no way I can be saved. I'm lost.
[1:16:07] I've crossed the crossed the line
[1:16:08] between mercy and judgment and I'm just
[1:16:10] wrong and there's no way back for me.
[1:16:12] You know, you've given him power, right?
[1:16:15] But then if you do the opposite now and
[1:16:17] say, "No, I'm a son or daughter of God.
[1:16:20] Satan, get behind me in the name of
[1:16:21] Jesus Christ. Amen. My Lord has given me
[1:16:23] complete authority over your works and
[1:16:25] you devil. Get behind me in Jesus
[1:16:27] Christ's name. This is This is not my
[1:16:29] portion. Amen. Anxiety is not my
[1:16:31] portion. Amen. Fear and depression,
[1:16:33] that's not my inheritance. Satan, get
[1:16:35] out in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:16:37] Satan, you can't tell me these things
[1:16:39] that I can never overcome. I can never
[1:16:41] be well. You're lying to me. You are
[1:16:43] disabling his power.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that you shall know the
[1:16:48] truth and the truth shall make you free.
[1:16:50] Now, the truth is more than a collection
[1:16:52] of nice ideas. It's more than just a
[1:16:54] good argument. No, the truth is a
[1:16:56] person.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The truth is the Lord Jesus
[1:16:58] Christ. So you continue in his word and
[1:17:01] you shall know me and I will make you
[1:17:04] free.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he is the way, the truth, and
[1:17:06] the life. Amen. And there's nothing that
[1:17:09] can stop our God doing what he wants to
[1:17:11] do. Why? Cuz our head is supreme.
[1:17:14] Hallelujah. I trust you've got a lot of
[1:17:16] confidence in your king. Amen. In your
[1:17:18] husband, your bridegroom. Amen. Praise
[1:17:21] the Lord. But you see the devil wants us
[1:17:23] to think that we are just a bunch of
[1:17:24] servants of someone else. This is
[1:17:27] Goliath. He would he would he would be
[1:17:29] telling the children of Israel because
[1:17:30] he's, you know, sending out the
[1:17:32] challenge, bring me a man. Bring me a
[1:17:34] man to fight me. Let's not all die.
[1:17:35] Just, you know, you pick your champion
[1:17:37] and I'm I'm the champion here. Come and
[1:17:39] fight. And he says, he says, why you why
[1:17:42] are you come out to set your battle in
[1:17:43] array? Am I not a Philistine and ye
[1:17:46] servants of Saul?
[1:17:49] See, the problem is Saul wasn't under
[1:17:50] the headship of the word anymore. He was
[1:17:53] under his own headship because he
[1:17:54] compromised because of fear of man. He
[1:17:56] was doing his own thing. So he wasn't
[1:17:58] under the shadow of mighty Jehovah's
[1:17:59] wings anymore. He wasn't under the
[1:18:00] headship of the word. He was under his
[1:18:02] own headship. So when he came under his
[1:18:04] own headship, then his army became his
[1:18:07] servants. But then David who was under
[1:18:09] the headship of the word because
[1:18:11] remember Samuel anointed him. See the
[1:18:13] spirit of God was with him from that day
[1:18:14] on. That means he came under a different
[1:18:16] headship. He came under the headship of
[1:18:18] Almighty God. So now when he came into
[1:18:20] the battle, David said, "And who is this
[1:18:23] uncircumcised Philistine that he should
[1:18:25] defy the armies of the living God?"
[1:18:27] Amen. So So he didn't even say, see, he
[1:18:29] says he's uncircumcised. Cuz someone
[1:18:31] who's under headship can recognize
[1:18:33] someone who is I mean something who is
[1:18:35] not,
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; right? Because if you're under headship,
[1:18:38] you've you've come in covenant with God,
[1:18:40] right? You're one with him. Amen. So
[1:18:42] he's telling the, you know, the you the
[1:18:44] Philistines, they have no promise with
[1:18:46] God.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Remember, it wasn't the God of Israel
[1:18:50] and the God of the Philistines had some
[1:18:52] kind of wrestling power match going on.
[1:18:54] No, the Israelites were under almighty
[1:18:56] Jehovah God who made everything.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; And the Philistines were just serving
[1:19:00] some dead fish god, just an idol.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know and you it was even
[1:19:04] shown when uh you know well I think it
[1:19:06] was before this you know when the you
[1:19:08] know when the ark was taken and all
[1:19:10] these things happened you know and then
[1:19:11] they brought the you know the
[1:19:12] Philistines brought the ark into the
[1:19:13] temple of Deeon. Then what happened?
[1:19:16] They came out the next morning and they
[1:19:18] found that statue of Deeon on its face
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; head broken off arms you know hands cut
[1:19:22] off. Why? Because everything has to bow
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; to that headship. Everything must bow to
[1:19:27] supreme authority. Amen. So now when and
[1:19:30] it's the same thing now when the spirit
[1:19:32] of Deaeon was was was tabernacled you
[1:19:34] could say or anointing Goliath and God
[1:19:37] almighty God was anointing David what
[1:19:39] happened when David threw that stone at
[1:19:42] him he he didn't fall down backwards he
[1:19:44] fell down on his face. Amen. Showing
[1:19:46] that the same authority that God had
[1:19:49] over Deeon was the same one when that
[1:19:50] spirit comes into a man. God still has
[1:19:52] supreme authority.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And why so so David David knew
[1:19:57] actually no why is he defying the armies
[1:19:59] of the living God. See David because he
[1:20:02] was under headship realized actually
[1:20:03] brethren we are an extension of God.
[1:20:06] We're his armies upon the earth. Amen.
[1:20:08] We're not servants of Saul. We're not
[1:20:10] working serving some man-made kingdom.
[1:20:12] No we are we are the armies of almighty
[1:20:14] God. We are his earthly strength upon
[1:20:17] the earth. Amen. Where God can live. God
[1:20:19] can manifest himself. It's the same
[1:20:21] thing with you and I friends. We got to
[1:20:22] realize we're not servants of Shikina
[1:20:24] Tabernacle. We're not servants of me,
[1:20:26] God forbid, or anything like that. No,
[1:20:28] we are the armies of the living God.
[1:20:30] We're the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:20:32] Where God can manifest his word through
[1:20:34] to this dying world.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you realize you're under when
[1:20:38] you're under that headship,
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Satan get watch out. You're in trouble.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. If God be for us, who can be
[1:20:45] against us? Why? Cuz he is my shield and
[1:20:47] my king.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we know that, you know, it
[1:20:50] was it was God that gave David the
[1:20:52] victory against Goliath. It wasn't
[1:20:54] David's ability. It was God's ability.
[1:20:56] When you come under the headship of the
[1:20:57] word, you realize it's not my physical
[1:20:59] ability that gives victory. No, you're
[1:21:01] just there and God does it.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz what is really a testimony? You're
[1:21:05] just giving evidence. I was there when
[1:21:07] God showed up and did something.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't free yourself. You
[1:21:11] didn't save yourself. God saved you. So
[1:21:13] when you testify of God's saving grace,
[1:21:14] you're just testifying of what he has
[1:21:16] done in your life. and we get healed or
[1:21:18] delivered or God does something. You're
[1:21:20] testifying of what he did when he showed
[1:21:21] up.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Because we have really
[1:21:26] have nothing to boast in our own ability
[1:21:27] or anything. No, it's all him.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Brother says in
[1:21:32] the Patmos vision, he says, "Don't fear
[1:21:34] John. Don't fear little flock. All that
[1:21:36] I am your heir to. All my power is
[1:21:38] yours. My omnipotence is yours as I
[1:21:41] stand in your midst." Amen. And I've not
[1:21:43] come to bring fear and failure, but
[1:21:45] love, courage, and ability. All power is
[1:21:47] given unto me, and it is yours to use.
[1:21:50] You speak the word, I'll perform it.
[1:21:51] That's my covenant, and it can never
[1:21:55] fail. Amen. Why? Because when you begin
[1:21:58] to speak the word, it is not you
[1:22:00] mentally saying something. It's God
[1:22:02] speaking. Amen. Have you ever come to a
[1:22:04] place when you're praying and you no
[1:22:05] longer praying, it's God praying. Amen.
[1:22:07] God, the inspiration strikes you. What
[1:22:09] is that? That is God speaking his word
[1:22:11] through you. Amen. And when you begin to
[1:22:13] address your enemy, it's not your, oh,
[1:22:14] what can I say? What can I do? But you
[1:22:16] realize God is that's your headship
[1:22:18] taking over your life. Amen. That's God
[1:22:20] stepping in into your battle. Amen. Why?
[1:22:22] And that's what happens when you speak
[1:22:24] that word, I'll perform it. It's not us
[1:22:26] trying to conjure something up. It's not
[1:22:28] mind over matter. No, it's God's
[1:22:30] revelation of his word anchored into our
[1:22:32] hearts. It speaks forth. Amen. And
[1:22:35] brings to and and then God brings to
[1:22:37] pass what you ask for.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember our God ain't
[1:22:42] some silent CEO somewhere in some head
[1:22:45] office. No, he's with us even in us to
[1:22:47] the end of the world.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what this message has come
[1:22:50] to do. To restore a true spiritual
[1:22:52] relationship between God and man.
[1:22:54] Hallelujah.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; What? That we're joint ears. Amen. He
[1:22:57] say in the book of Malachi, "Behold, the
[1:22:59] day cometh that shall burn as an oven,
[1:23:01] and all the proud day, all that do
[1:23:02] wickedly shall be stubble. The day that
[1:23:04] cometh shall burn them up, say the Lord
[1:23:06] of hosts, it shall leave neither root
[1:23:07] nor branch. But unto you that fear my
[1:23:10] name. And that word fear means a
[1:23:12] reverential trust.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; There's an all. When we speak the name
[1:23:15] of Jesus, it it ain't a curse word. It
[1:23:18] ain't just say it isn't just a name.
[1:23:20] There's an all that comes into our
[1:23:22] hearts. Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. You're
[1:23:24] the Lord God Almighty who made all
[1:23:26] things redeeming on you that day on
[1:23:28] Calvary. You are the supreme one. Yes,
[1:23:30] sir.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that shows you've got fear
[1:23:32] for his name.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says that they that fear
[1:23:35] my name. Shall the son of righteousness
[1:23:37] arise. Hallelujah. With healing in his
[1:23:40] wings. Amen. There's not condemnation in
[1:23:43] his wings. Is not judgment. No, there's
[1:23:45] healing in his wings. Amen. That has
[1:23:47] arisen. Amen. A new season is dawning. I
[1:23:49] tell you what, friends, we're not
[1:23:50] staying in the same season forever. So,
[1:23:52] I'm trying to get this across to you.
[1:23:54] Whatever you're going through now is not
[1:23:55] forever. It's not eternal. It's not
[1:23:57] fixed. Amen. You will come out of it
[1:23:59] stronger and better than ever before.
[1:24:00] Amen. Why? Because the sun is rising.
[1:24:03] Hallelujah. Amen. He's risen with
[1:24:05] healing in his wings. Amen. Was that
[1:24:07] healing of our bodies? Healing of our
[1:24:09] spirits. Amen. Healing of our hearts.
[1:24:11] Amen. What did he say when he stood
[1:24:13] there in the synagogue, I think in
[1:24:14] Nazareth, and he opened the book of
[1:24:16] Isaiah? He says, "The spirit of the Lord
[1:24:17] is upon me to bind out the
[1:24:19] brokenhearted." Said, "At liberty, them
[1:24:21] that are bruised." Amen. To restore
[1:24:23] sight to the blind. Amen. What is that?
[1:24:25] This people have been broken would be
[1:24:27] healed. Amen. Hearts that have been
[1:24:29] smashed would be brought back together.
[1:24:31] Amen. where where spiritual eyes have
[1:24:32] become blinded because of pain or man's
[1:24:34] systems. Amen. That that the sight would
[1:24:37] be restored. Amen. Those that are in
[1:24:39] prison, amen, complexes, pains, those
[1:24:41] chains would be broken. Amen. That we'll
[1:24:43] be set at liberty because we are the
[1:24:46] bride of Jesus Christ by his grace.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he has arisen with healing in
[1:24:51] his wings. Not with judgment or
[1:24:53] condemnation or well I told you so and
[1:24:55] all those kind of things pushing you
[1:24:57] down. No, he wants to lift us up.
[1:24:59] Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has arisen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to finish with this
[1:25:09] one scripture. Maybe the musicians could
[1:25:10] come. I just want to finish it here cuz
[1:25:12] I I just feel this is a good place to
[1:25:14] stop. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; You are the apple of his eye.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; You are his beloved. Amen. You are the
[1:25:21] very purpose of his being right now is
[1:25:24] you. You say little old me on this back
[1:25:26] side of the Pacific. Absolutely. He
[1:25:28] cares for you more than you realize.
[1:25:30] Amen. He's not some distant head that
[1:25:32] just says, "Just be in your place,
[1:25:33] woman." God ain't interested in that
[1:25:35] kind of a deal. He wants to reveal
[1:25:38] himself. He wants you to know him. He
[1:25:41] wants you to know who you are.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what and to me, what does it
[1:25:46] do? It gives me such a security,
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; such a stability, such a peace. Well,
[1:25:51] how can you have peace? Somehow I do.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Gives me such a joy.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm on my way to heaven shouting
[1:25:58] victory.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is supreme over my life
[1:26:02] and he's supreme over all things.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we don't have to worry. Let's
[1:26:07] just actually let's just go to um uh no,
[1:26:11] let's just read this. He says that he
[1:26:12] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:26:14] church, not having spot or wrinkle or
[1:26:16] any such thing, but that it should be
[1:26:18] holy and without blemish. So ought men
[1:26:20] to love their wives as their own bodies.
[1:26:22] He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
[1:26:24] So if you really love yourself,
[1:26:25] brothers, that love is shown by you love
[1:26:27] your wife. Okay? For no man ever hateth
[1:26:30] his own flesh, but nourisheth and
[1:26:32] cherisheth it, even as the Lord the
[1:26:33] church. For we are members of his body,
[1:26:35] of his flesh, of his bones.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; We're power of his power, spirit of his
[1:26:40] spirit, life of his life. Amen. As
[1:26:42] brother says, she is him. Our identity
[1:26:44] is is in him.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what can we say to these
[1:26:48] things? I say, Lord, thank you.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'm under your banner. I'm
[1:26:52] not I'm not under the protection of a
[1:26:54] church or some hierarchy of man or even
[1:26:57] some religion. I'm under the protection
[1:26:59] of almighty God that he is my king. He
[1:27:02] is my head. Amen. I get my orders from
[1:27:04] him. Amen. It's not do this, do that
[1:27:06] like a servant. It's like honey, I love
[1:27:08] you.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; I want to spend the rest of this life
[1:27:11] with you. Then I'm going to take you
[1:27:13] into eternity. We're going to enjoy
[1:27:14] eternity together.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not some squash downcast
[1:27:19] thing. That's what the devil's tried to
[1:27:21] put in our put in our minds. No, we're
[1:27:23] the apple of his eye.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He loves us with an unfailing
[1:27:26] love.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's stand this
[1:27:29] morning. Let's sing that song. Oh love
[1:27:31] of God, how rich and pure, how
[1:27:33] measureless and strong. Amen. I love
[1:27:35] that. Well, I love that whole song, but
[1:27:37] that last verse, what's the whole
[1:27:39] purpose of it? Drawing out my heart to
[1:27:41] thee. Amen. So, it's not a goal for a
[1:27:43] separation or anything. No, we join ears
[1:27:45] together. Amen. So, let's sing this,
[1:27:47] shall we?
[1:27:50] Amen.
[1:27:53] The love of God
[1:27:56] is greater
[1:28:00] than tongue open
[1:28:03] can ever tell.
[1:28:07] It goes beyond
[1:28:10] the highest s
[1:28:14] and reaches to
[1:28:17] the lowest hell.
[1:28:20] The guilty pier
[1:28:24] bowed down with care.
[1:28:28] God gave his son
[1:28:32] to win
[1:28:35] his child.
[1:28:38] He reconciled
[1:28:42] and pardoned from
[1:28:46] his sin.
[1:28:49] Oh love of God,
[1:28:52] how rich and pure,
[1:28:56] how measureless

[1:29:39] on rocks and hills
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:42] and mountains full.
[1:29:46] God's love so sure
[1:29:49] shall still endure
[1:29:53] for me
[1:29:57] and strong
[1:30:00] redeeming grace
