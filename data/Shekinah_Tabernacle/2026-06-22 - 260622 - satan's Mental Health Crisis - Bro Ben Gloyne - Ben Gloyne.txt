praise the lord amen praise the lord also reminded there's a youth service at 3 p.m today but everyone's welcome it's a three it's been re yeah okay yeah um yeah but yeah at three so everyone's welcome to that even though it's a youth service but so anyway um joshua two and verse three we're going to read down to verse 11 here this is speaking of rahab after um she has um yeah she's hidden the spies and this is all going on so joshua two and four and the woman took the two men there's two spies from israel and hit them and said thus there came men unto me but i wish not whence they were and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whether the men went i what not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them but she had brought them up to um up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fords and as soon as they uh which pursued after them had gone out they shut the gate and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof and she said unto them she said unto the men now notice this i know that the lord has given you the land and that your terror has fallen upon us this is very important and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out came up out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kings the amorites that were on the other side of jordan see hon and og whom he utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath amen amen let's pray hallelujah lord jesus we love you lord you're so great lord we just stand in awe of you father we come to praise your name today oh god i pray father that lord you take

morning and or whoever may be watching this father we commit our service lord the day just take control father we surrender it into your hands lord may you take the floor now for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you may have your seats this morning i'd like to speak about the devil's mental health crisis it's the devil's mental health crisis okay i want to speak about that because he's going through a big mental health crisis right now and this is not to gain him give him sympathy not to give him any i feel i don't feel sorry for him he can have all the blood pressure he can have all the heart attacks he can have all the fainting spells and the anxiety problems and panic attacks he can have it all and times it by a million law just pour it on i mean because it's his own fault but so you know it's really important to know the morale of the enemy in a war it's very important if you know the morale of the enemy amen it's very important to know amen because you know you may look at them and on the outside they may have their guns ready their weapons shining they can be in their formations their bunkers whatever have all their men and their tanks and their bombs and their guns but it's on the inside of the man what's going on in the heart of the soldier which what really matters i mean so it's very important to know the morale of the of of the opposing force you know if the if the enemy's got a good morale well i guess the battle is gonna be a bit harder but we're gonna win right amen hey we've got total victory victory sure right but if we know that the that the enemy is broken his heart is melted he has no more courage amen that he's just nothing but a bluff amen we know we're going to win even the more hallelujah because you know it's not it's not it doesn't matter how numerous he is how great his equipment is what his bows are how great he says his missiles are i'm just typing the natural with the spiritual you know the enemy can stand up and say i've got a weapon with one weapon i can wipe out the entire northern hemisphere you know they can make their make their boats make their claims how numerous they are but doesn't matter how much noise he makes all of us propaganda what he tells you he's bluffing he's nothing but a bluff and the devil is nothing but a bluff right now amen see he see see see but even though he's bluffing we're still called to fight i'm in the battle maybe the lord say amen but he he wants us to come to the battle yes lord amen now we've got to understand we're not fighting a natural foe right but we're fighting i mean you know so we're not fighting our least favorite political party or any any kind of movement we're not fighting flesh and blood i mean but we're fighting against spiritual powers in high places we're fighting as demon spirits this is what we're fighting against in this hour right it's not against flesh and blood not against some people it's against spirit right now the devil wants us to think his thoughts he wants us to act according to him he wants us to feel how he feels that's what an anointing does amen when you feel the anointing of god you feel faith you feel love you feel joy it comes to pulsate through your being because god is anointing you to believe his word and if you take the contrary to that the devil puts unbelief he puts doubt he puts questions he puts reason against the word of god because that's how he feels and he's trying to get you to agree with him amen so he's nothing but a bluff now we read there we read that the that the enemy had fainted they had no more strength because of the people of god now what an incredible encouragement that would have been to joshua where joshua you know moses had been taken off the scene you know god already told told joshua and joshua chapter one moses my servant is dead you know you go over jordan and possess the land and and so god had commissioned joshua this is your job you're going to take the people across this jordan you're going to put them in the promised land and he says i'll never leave you nor forsake me i'll be with you but be strong and very courageous and it's a what a report it would have been when these two spies came back from jericho and they because remember rahab was now revealing to israel this is what's really in the heart of the men so basically she is telling them don't look at the walls don't look because remember they would have had their helmets on their shields their you know their armor their spears or their bows they would have been around the walls they would have been ready for a fight but in them there was no fight right so outwardly it looked like they were going to fight but in them they they had no fights their courage had gone their hearts had melted i mean why because a covenant people of god were coming into the land to possess your inheritance amen they were coming into the promise that god had given them saying i've given you this land you're going to go possess this land this is the promised word for your life and you're going to fulfill it so here they were crossing crossing jordan and what an incredible joy you know joshua would have had his dancing shoes on hallelujah because he had known god was for them but then he realized that the same god was with them actually the terror of the lord had fallen upon the enemy and now that enemy was done hallelujah amen so what an encouragement that would have would have been for joshua now if we could really look into the heart of the devil right now we would see that the same the same uh lack of courage in these enemy soldiers you know their hearts being melted all their courage had gone that's in the enemy he's nothing but a bluff right but that's how he really is if he would stand here and tell the truth to say this is the morale of the opposing force that you're fighting we're done we're shot we're in big trouble amen hallelujah so we need to come to the battle but we're here to fight the battle and win the battle now we're going to get to the devil's mental health state it's not a good state we're going to get to it but then he wants to put that state upon you and you need to realize actually i have no part of him he has no part in me so why should i feel the way he feels i think think the way he thinks act the way he acts you know it's not my portion that's where we're going if in case you're wondering so we're told in ephesians 6 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for you wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins good about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith whether you're able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints now we know that they that the peoples of the promised land that were just squatters there they didn't just migrate because god told abraham that his seed is going to come back here after 400 years and so yo dwell in the land but but the devil inspired them to build big cities train big armies because the devil was actually preparing for a fight because the devil's been fighting since before time against the word of god he has been fighting to stop it being fulfilled that's his job that's what he tries to do but we got to realize he can't stop it he cannot stop prophecy being fulfilled he cannot stop god's children coming to their previous day position he cannot stop it he cannot stop you he cannot stop god amen because the scripture says if the lord before us who could be against us amen so now they didn't just quit they resisted and fought but they had no strength they had no courage and the reason that they lost all the courage is because they heard about their buddies in egypt being drowned in the red sea so the devils that were in the promised land were now panicking and and and the terror of god fell upon them because the devils that were upon the children of israel is cruel task masters amen those egyptians they were destroyed so it's the same thing now we were we were in in in the world you call egypt you know we walked a coin the prince of the power of the year right in ephesians 2 so that so the devil had rule over our life he's a cruel task master he never give us a day off he never gave us a holiday never gave us a nice time he's mean he would he would he would trick us into all kinds of things but then we'd wake up with regret and anxiety and why did i do this and i can't believe i said that and you know i can't believe i you know and you know and we we're just in cruel bondage but then you begin to call upon god like israel called upon god in egypt and god sent deliverance their way hallelujah and then it's the same thing with us we call upon the lord he says i'm going to call you out of egypt i'm going to take you out of this place and he takes us through just like israel was taken through the red sea and all of their task masters drowned in the red sea it's the same with unbelief and demon powers that used to beat us down and caused us trouble when we went through the blood of jesus christ we looked behind and those things were drowned i mean when those demon spirits were drowned in the blood of jesus christ they couldn't follow you i mean why because they can't come through the blood like you can come through the blood so we can look back and we can stay on the other side of the red sea and shout and rejoice and say that pride devil's dead i mean that unbelief devil's dead amen that you're that anxiety whatever it is that pride that unforgiveness that stubborn spirit that's gone i mean he's face down in the blood of jesus christ he's dead hallelujah and what does that do to the rest of the devils that are trying to withstand you it makes their morale go because it says when we heard of this when we heard of what god did at the red sea all of our hearts went our courage was gone the terror of the lord came upon us because of you why did they why did they panic and get that terror because god's children walked in here i am hallelujah and it makes the devil shake in his boots hallelujah amen that's why their courage went they had no strength for war no more because their buddies in egypt were killed and those same people were coming their way they were on collision course hallelujah and it's always the bigger force wins amen it's the same thing with you and i we're we're on our way to canaan's fair land we're on our way into a millennium we're on our way into a rapture into a body change that's our way and and we're in collision course with the devil and his fortifications i said it's just going to be like this hallelujah and we're going to keep moving on hallelujah through prayer and supplication being surrendered to the word of god we're going to take every mountain we're going to take every promise amen every promise is ours by right just like the land was theirs by right god gave it to them it wasn't them that gave it to them god gave it to them it's the same thing with every promise in the word god god has given it to you by the blood of jesus christ it's yours by right hallelujah it's not the devils it's yours i mean every divine promise is yours hallelujah and and that just brings us on a collision course with satan because satan says that's not for you the joy of the holy ghost is not for you the holy ghost is not for you to be free is not for you you've just got to think the same kind of way for the rest of your life who says you'll never be happy who said that's the devil trying to keep you off the mountain of joy hallelujah yo that's just the devil trying to stop you getting your promises amen he you know he says oh god don't move like that anymore who said you read the book of acts oh that's all you know that's because that was back then and society's changed and now there's is everywhere and god don't move like that who said who said oh that was just brother branham's day who said that's the devil trying to stop you walking in every divine promise to see the reality of the word not just an argument remember this message is not an argument this message is a resurrected power i mean we can say that jesus rose from the grave because we see him walk among us his spirit touching lives transforming people's hearts we see it do we not we say his word put on flesh what's that that is jesus walking through amen so it's not an argument no it's a resurrected life it's jesus christ himself hallelujah but the devil try and push it back and put up scarecrows no no no there's there's food on the scarecrows amen the devil is trying to tell you it's not for you who said he says it's not for you because it's not for him so he tries to put his experience upon you i trust if that's all you get in the service i trust that's what you get because remember he can't be saved so he says you can't be saved he says you've gone too far it's because he's already gone too far and there's no blood for him anyway to be redeemed but he but he's crossed the line he fell from his first estate and he's done he says he says your losses because he's lost amen right he says you can't overcome because he can't overcome he tries to put his own experience upon you but if you agree with him his experience becomes your experience you know there's nothing in church that's because there's nothing in church for him right this word wasn't firm it's for believers he's an unbeliever he's a make-believe but he's not a believer right oh there's no rapture that's because there's no rapture for him right there's no there's no new body worse because there's not one for him so he'll try and take his experience and put it upon you and try and get you to agree with him we're not meant to do that here's why you've got to discern well no one loves you it's because no one loves him because he can't love no one cares for him well no because he doesn't care for anyone right you got to take he tries to always put his experience upon you sure now the big difference between israel and the rest of the nations is because god made a covenant with them abraham brother ramsey was like any other ordinary man but god called him that made the difference amen amen it's the same thing with with you and i we're just ordinary people but then god called us that makes a difference amen abraham was like anyone else there but then god called him and he said he said walk with me he began to walk hallelujah and it's the same thing with us god called it god's called you god's called you he hasn't called you just to lead you somewhere and leave you no he called you to keep you he saves you to keep you he's going to take you all the way through amen he called you for a purpose and it wasn't for you to die in the wilderness or you know no you're going to go into your inheritance you know the fullness of the body change who believes that i'm not here for a part-time kind of christianity i'm here to go all the way because the lord is going to take me all the way hallelujah praise the lord amen amen praise god hallelujah amen see god called abraham that's what matters that's the difference between us and i say you know god can call anyone he wants but in this very time and space i say well the difference between me and maybe someone else's god called me god may call them later but he's called me and i'm happy i pray call them i mean so the difference between israel and the rest of the world is god made a covenant with them and the difference between the bride of christ and the rest of the world is that god has made a covenant with you amen and if he made the covenant he's going to fulfill it because it's an unconditional covenant see we've got to think see the devil's all about my works and me and remember he said i will ascend i'll be like the most high i'm going to be this way i'm going to be worshipped as god me me me i i self that's what that's how he operates but you know the law doesn't say if you do he says i've done it just walk in it right just walk in my promises walk in my promised word that's why he died on calvary amen jesus i mean brother brown would say in israel in the church you'd say no um he'd say he say and now christ was hanging between he was slain yonder between heavens and earth when the sun went down blackness over the earth and there he was uh tore apart god pulled the soul out of him and he wrote a covenant with the families of the earth when that precious unadulterated blood of the almighty god dripping from emmanuel's veins he tore that soul out of him he cried my god my god why is that forsaken me his face was full of mockery spit a crown of cruel mockery pulled down over his brow his nails drove with roman spikes his back riven until his ribs showed through swinging on the cross screaming dying as sinner's death the sin of the world was upon him and their god riven his sides tore his soul out of him then he said unto him into thy hands i command my spirit he dropped his head and the earth shook and belches rocks there he is there's god's covenant there's the fulfilling of it so he wrote a covenant with you that day hallelujah amen and that covenant is not the same covenant he has with the devil then because he made a promise with the devil there in the judgment seat there in in the garden of eden when sin had come in he he made a promise to satan the head of the seed the seed of the woman is going to bruise or crush the head of the seed of the serpent hallelujah and that was fulfilled in christ so he made a promise with the devil it wasn't a good promise for the devil right but he didn't make that same promise with us amen he said i'm going to make you in my image amen you're going to be like me you're going to be my word in flesh amen it's not going to be your nature it's not going to be you living it's going to be me living through you hallelujah amen amen and so the covenant that he made with us is literally he would take sin nature out of our lives and he would write his word upon our hearts by the holy ghost and he would dwell in our hearts and manifest his word through us that was his covenant that we would become living walking talking bible hallelujah and it's not by memory reciting chapter and verse which is fine but it's lived out of our hearts amen amen hallelujah so they had to go see israel had the pillar of fire walking with them they had god the shard of the king was in the camp sure balaam had the same sacrifices as as as moses did but but the difference between balaam and moses is that moses had the pillar of fire they had the shout of the king in the camp they were on their way to fulfill the promise of the hour that was the difference now that same pillar of fire is leading the church today he has always led his church amen from the old testament to the new because we know jehovah of the old is jesus christ of the news amen so i say stop analyzing what i'm saying and just enjoy okay so listen it's the same pillar of fire as leading us i mean that same holy ghost anointing is leading us the same god that led them to their promises the same god leading us to our promise right we are not here just to go through a religious motion but we're here to live a overcoming life be full of praise and glory highly enough with doubt and unbelief and trouble and none of that stuff but joy unspeakable full of glory amen hallelujah amen so those soldiers if i could just dramatize it they're on jericho's walls you know the army of jericho you know they're they're behind the battlements and maybe they're glad their knees are behind battlements because their knees are shaking like this and they're wondering what are they going to do and they're going around what are they going to do and maybe after six days maybe they start to whisper i can't take this no more well they're going to attack a lot i can't take the psychological warfare going on in our minds and the devil's the same thing you get up in the morning you're the most powerful people on the earth the brighter jesus christ is the most powerful people in existence it's not nato it's not putin it's not whoever it's you because you have power within you to shape the kingdom of hell amen to actually cast the devil out of people's lives that people's lives are eternally changed hallelujah and you roll out of bed in the morning and the devil's knees begin to shake what are they going to do today hallelujah i pray i pray hell talks about me like that don't you want to be the most feared thing in hell hallelujah as a believer filled with the holy ghost that's what the most fair the most fair thing you know what i love you know jesus would jesus would go in in matthew 8 and he would he would go to the um country of the uh gecenerys or have you say it and then met him two men possessed with devils coming out of the tombs are exceedingly fast so that no man might pass that way so here were these two demon-possessed men they lived in the tombs and you know the devil loves death and separation that's how he operates and so the they're demon-possessed men and they and people wouldn't walk near them anymore because they're exceedingly fast and you know maybe travelers would go this way and say hold on we can't go this way this is too demon possessed man we're not going this way and they're going maybe go the long way around but then jesus steps on the shore and he begins to walk that way and now these exceedingly fierce demon possessed men the spirit cries out of them and and the cry is not i'm going to destroy you this is your last day you you're going to wish you'll be dead before i kill you no their cries what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us before the time so he's so so the devil is asking the lord have you come to torment us before the time so they know there's a time they know there's the time when they are going to be tormented and jesus could have said actually i have yeah and he could have tortured them he could have fixed them he could have those spirits now he could have literally put them like they were in the lake of fire already hey man so this is imagine now this is the mental health trouble that the devil has he has this over his head every day now i'm not trying to make you feel sorry for him but i just want to get you to realize this is this is what he lives with this is not just a bad day this is not just a bad decade this is not just a stressful century this is a stressful 6 000 years or however long where he knows his time is coming and now so so this is really the heart of the devil is it really have you come to torment us before the time i don't think it's time yet jesus i've read your word and no no we're not here yet you know but but this was the this was their big concern have you come to torment us and imagine waking up knowing you've got a death sentence the clock is ticking you know the same promises we shout and rejoice in we're in the rapture season we're living in the season the resurrection because the word says we're here right our bodies are going to be changed the dead and christ are going to rise it's not a fantasy it's not a fantasy a fairy tale it's a reality we see the world falling apart it's meant to fall apart we see prophecy being fulfilled and it excites our souls it doesn't excite him it just raises his blood pressure it stresses them all the more anxiety begins to shoot through the roof why because he's though that time that they talked about 2000 years ago is just around the corner amen hallelujah amen so they know there's a time appointed they know there's great trouble ahead for them this made me happy because i really realized you know satan's full of anxiety he's full of stress he's full of worry he has no more courage all of hell's heart is fainted right they're full of stress they're ringing their hands how we're going to pull this off boys i thought it was going to work you told us lucifer it wouldn't all these things going on but you see now he wants to take that mental health pandemic in hell and put it upon you he wants you to feel the same way he's feeling and brother brown was saying the lady is seeing church age he'd say so this is from this is from where it says about our age that we're rich and miserable poor blind and naked speak of the age that we live in he says god says this uh church of later seeing ages wretched that word comes from that word comes from two greek words which means to endure endure and trial and it has nothing but it has nothing to do with trials that come to a true christian for god describes a christian trial as blessed uh and his attitude of one of joy whereas this description is phrased as wretched and miserable how strange in this land in this age of planting in this age of progress in this age of abundance how can there be trials well now it is strange but in this age of plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there's so much more to be had what with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation where everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pet pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes this age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly goods but people are less happy than ever this age boasts of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure about themselves never now we should be there should be a time when we're more sure about ourselves because the lord has promised good to us amen he has given us our shadow of a doubt thus saith the lord on the scripture this is the age of the body change and he's prepared us to take that change right we should know who we are in the states more than anything else we should know who we are in christ i mean this age boasts of better moral values and it is more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its knowledge in science but it's fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth in one generation we've gone all the way from the horse and buggy age to the space age and we're proud and boastful about it but inside is a dark void cavern that is crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it cannot back it up it cries peace and there is no peace it cries there's a great amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace at the lord to the wicked now that was back in 1965 that was written and we can see it in 2022 there's a mental health crisis upon the earth where we shouldn't have a mental health crisis i remember when um when um uh bernie noelier first came here from argentina and i just said how this this country is one of the greatest suicide rates in the world and they couldn't they couldn't fathom that what you have everything you don't have to struggle there's money there's food there's jobs there's you know but yet how can there be this suicide rate so high it's because there's an emptiness but what it is it's the devil's mental health health crisis has been put onto human beings amen right that's that's what's happened because he's he's projecting how he feels upon people because remember we we we uh we are influenced by two sides heaven and hell right so god's word is wanting to influence us but then hell wants to influence us also now just because we are christians does not make us immune from the influence of the devil right we're still built like everyone else we still have the same spirit realm like everyone else everything the difference is we have god on the inside if you really know him right you have an overcoming power with union which is he himself is in you the lord jesus christ but you see so so so there's these two powers pushing us and if we are not careful we will begin to think like the rest of the world because that same influence remember this world is in ladies here right we are not in some force-filled bubble where the world cannot affect us we're in the world but we're not of the world but the world will try and affect us so the atmosphere at work or at school or at your job will try and influence you and try and drag you down to where it is amen so what is that that's the devil trying to make you think like he thinks how he feels get you to feel that same way remember his heart's failed why are men's hearts failing for fear because the devil's heart's failing he is he is in panic mode and he wants us to be in panic mode now don't get me wrong when i'm talking about being uh being a bit i mean you know we are all subject to being nervous right or being a bit anxious a bit worried about something that's all within normal human emotional range but when i talk about depression and really being anxious that you can't cope with anything new anything different that's not normal right yeah so don't get me wrong if i'm you know don't misunderstand me if i say well we shouldn't be anxious you know or rather rather you know the reason you feel anxious is because of you know the devil's trying to put it on you if it's just normal who's ever been worried to get something done but it's just within a normal range of human feeling right or you get stressed i've got to get this done i've got to clean this zero that's normal right brother ram says we all need a bit of pressure in our lives otherwise it'd be jellyfish we all actually need a bit of pressure is good too much pressure is bad right so so please don't take this out of out of cater and also i want to say this just because you feel anxious or even depression tries to come upon you does not mean you're not a christian right because those same things will try and affect you if you agree with it it will if you say no it can't but it's up to you who you know are you going to agree with him or not so he wants to get us to feel and think the way he's feeling and thinking if he can get you to agree with him then he can influence your life just like the holy ghost wants you to agree with him if you fully agree with him he'll take over your life the word will take over your life amen so now we all have happy times we have sad times stressful times relaxing times distressing times we all go through those range of experience right but i'm talking about being nervous all the time or being depressed all the time being anxious all the time being overly stressed all the time yo that's unhealthy being envious of others that's a curse being jealous that's that's the devil's feelings that's the devil's experience right because it says in the bible this is from the english standard version philippians 4 and 6 be not anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests made known to god so is it so the bible saying don't be anxious about anything amen just give it all to the lord with prayer and supplication it says in the peace of god which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus so our minds need to be guarded right by prayer and supplication don't be anxious about it just give it to the lord amen right just trust your day trust your schedule into his hands amen now it's like you know loneliness is not of god to feel alone that no one understands you no one cares you can't relate to your own and feeling alone now unfortunately in this age and especially with the pandemic that we have is loneliness has skyrocketed people are being disconnected even though we have zoom in different devices there's not actually real emotional attachment to it even in friendship and so people feel lonely now loneliness is of hell jesus would tell the story of a certain rich man and then lazarus the beggar and they both died and the rich man went to hell and and and he lifted up his eyes and he saw that great chasm and then on the other side of the great chasm was was lazarus the poor man in the bosom of abraham so in heaven there was fellowship it was abraham and lazarus there was fellowship in heaven right but but but the poor man in hell he just saw them he didn't see anyone else around them but he wouldn't he wouldn't unfortunately be the only person in hell there's other people there but because there's an attribute of hell everyone will feel alone yeah yeah right so we should never ever if we feel alone it's because that lung that true loneliness of being cut off from everyone and is not from god it's the devil trying to put his feelings upon you so you've got to discern and withstand the antichrist spirit right if you feel alone that's not god making you feel alone that's the enemy trying to cut you off from everything that's a lie it's a tormenting spirit depression is not of god amen to be sad sure we'll be sad we need you know to be sad and cry is actually a healthy thing it's actually healthy to mourn it's a healthy thing right oh yes right but but to be depressed is not right but that depression is because the devil's depressed i thought i was gonna win if he if you tell the truth sure he's deceived somebody thinks he's gonna pull it but if he's really honest he'll say no i'm done i couldn't stop this much scripture being fulfilled amen how can i stop the end being fulfilled if god promises and promises and fulfilled this how can he not fulfill this if he is honest this is how he'd really begin to think and yet so depression is from a demon spirit right to be overly stressed and anxious that's the devil's feelings he's stressed his time's coming he's anxious about it his morale is not high he's not confident he may appear to be confident but he's nothing but a bluff he's stressing out his blood pressure if he has such a thing has gone through the charts i say go higher lord make him go higher right he's having all kinds of things going on in himself and it's not peace it's not love it's not joy it's stress anxiety depression worry fear if you have fear in your life that fear is not from god that's because of demons fear they put that trying to put that same experience on you amen see if we can discern these things like hold on this is not this is not god this is the devil doing this to me amen i don't have to put up with it i mean to be nervous you can't handle the smallest thing that's that's that's not of god it's not a healthy way to be it's not a right way to be and so he's trying to the devil is trying to put his experiences upon you in your daily life i know i'm repeating myself i want to emphasize this because we can be so led by emotion so easily you know and we should never you know when it comes to worshiping god our emotions should not dictate it right i'm saved irrespective of how i feel amen my feelings don't come into it it's faith that comes into it amen amen i'm going to rapture because of faith not because of how i feel i'm i'm an overcomer not because of how i feel because of what i believe because of what's been anchored in my heart right so we shouldn't come to worship you know some people come to church and they do and they just sit there like a stone because they've had a hard week i'm not here to worship my week i'm here to worship god hallelujah i'm here to worship god i wanna i'll lift my voice say god you're my king you're my everything you've washed me white as snow you've redeemed me i was in darkness the devil had me bound but you set me free and you've killed the devils behind me and they're dead in the blood of jesus christ i can walk god in victory hallelujah he's my lover he's never has jesus done anything wrong to anyone amen the devil thinks he's done something wrong to him and he wants to put that you know the devil's angry with god he's angry with god yeah and so he tries to put that same anger on people people get resentful it's god's fault god i hate you because you do i'm not going to serve you no more because you did this it's because the devil put that's his experience because of his pride and so he puts that upon people and people agree with it but they're actually just living up the devil's experience i'm not here to live out the devil's experience i need to live out god's experience hallelujah amen amen so the blood of jesus christ has redeemed us from the devil's grip so none of what he is going through belongs to you the blood has loosed you from the grip of satan completely not just one finger off they're all gone not just one chain dead you can't be bound by broken chains unless you agree with those broken chains and think they actually have control in your life see the devil wants us to think we're still bound but no the blood has loosed us amen so every part of the devil has no part in our lives right so his fear his anxiety his depression his unbelief his whatever it is that's negative on his side pride jealousy envy strife emulations anger what um unforgiveness stubbornness whatever it is that has no part in you because the blood has loosed it from you hallelujah we have no part in him and he has no part in us amen we've got to keep that in our hearts because when the devil tries to put his depression on us or unforgiveness on us or jealousy on us or you know feeling you know being anxious and stress and nervousness and so on no no hold on you got to look and say is this in our covenant god hold on um no yeah well then why why am i owning it yeah why am i taking possession of it why why am i making it part of my being you know people will take stubbornness and they'll and and their middle name will be stubbornness or pride or jealousy or envy it's basically their middle name because they're because they live it out of their lives they can't help it but what's happened they've taken ownership of it they've actually said this is me no that's not you this is you this is you amen not those things but you've got to realize actually this has no pardon me jesus did not die to make me proud he did not die to make me boastful he did not die to make me envious he had not died to make me jealous he'd not die to give me unbelief no he died that i'd give have life and life more abundantly i mean that he had lived my life and he'd manifest his word that's why he died amen so we need to very much look into these things and say uh uh hold on satan take your goods and go they're not mine they're yours stop trying to give me your experience satan i can't give you my experience but i can tell you my experience he knows your experience he was there when the lord saved your soul when he got cast out of the throne room of your heart he got dethroned amen one of my favorite scriptures and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was her place found any more in heaven so the devil was cast down he was thrown down he didn't jump he was pushed hallelujah and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him so everything that we're fighting is as a fallen enemy it fell he didn't come down on his own choosing he was pushed hallelujah he was cast out amen the lord said get out of heaven satan he was cast out upon the earth now what i love about it is that same god that pursued him out of heaven has come down upon the earth aiding to pursue his enemy upon the earth so that's why the devils were shaking in their boots when jesus came their way have you come to torment us before the time yeah yes they are exceedingly fierce to humans but to god they're just nothing hallelujah amen i heard a loud voice in heaven now with salvation and strength in the kingdom of our god and the power of christ for the accuser of brethren is cast down which accused him before our god day and night and now he's our scripture and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and their love that not their lives until the death it means they overcame him so it's amazing so we're overcoming him now but the bible's already and i've overcome him yeah it's done all my life it's already prophesied it's done i'm just walking into the prophecy and as i'm walking it's being fulfilled i mean so overcome by the blood of the lamb why because the devil is washed from us loose from us by the blood of jesus christ amen unbelief is taken from us he doesn't control our lives no more if you're a spirit-filled christian god is the king of your life amen not the devil if you're not it's the devil rule in your life i say trade kings have a revolution take up arms they will not be will not let this cruel task master will us no more revolution hallelujah amen we should be a bunch of rebels against the devil amen hallelujah amen and they overcome by the bloodline and the word of their testimony what is that you are testifying sure it's the word of your testimony what god has done on you in your life but your testimony should be the word of god concerning you amen i am i am beloved i am accepted i am redeemed hallelujah i've been made in his image my children are coming my family's coming nowhere performed against me shall prosper amen i've got joy i've got peace i've got love amen i've got faith i've got overcoming power because the word says i'm testifying i'm giving witness this word is true because it's been promised to me yes lord hallelujah amen amen therefore rejoice your heavens and you that dwell in them we sit in heavenly places we're called to rejoice amen woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devils come down to you having great wrath because he knows he has but a short time time's ticking devil time's ticking hallelujah see you've got to realize you know the devil tries to torment you i'm going to get you i'm going to get you i'm going to get you you're going to go too far you'll say no devil god's already got you amen because he conquered you on calvary you have peace your own health you know you are defeated so don't leave the devil tormented you're going to get your children i'm going to get your family i'm going to get no no satan my god has got you already he's got your number i mean you've already been found guilty and you're on your way to the chopping block you're on death row not me amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the lord that's why we've got to look into these things say you know it's not in our inheritance to have a mental health crisis it's not our portion jesus did not die that we would be depressed he would not die that would be anxious and stressed and nervous and alone hallelujah he didn't die for those things that's not our inheritance our inheritance is the holy ghost our inheritance is love see the difference between see see satan was the king of our lives once but then the but then he was dethroned and god became the king of our life right so once upon a time the believer walked according to the spirit of this world the prince of the power of the year that now will that that is now working and the children of disobedience this is ephesians two and two so we all walked once once upon a time according to the devil but then the difference is that when he was cast out the lord jesus became king on the throne of our hearts so we used to walk according to his unbelief we used to walk according to his doubt to his stress to his anxiety but now the believer by the baptism of the holy ghost walks according to god's faith god's love god's peace god's joy god's comfort and god's wisdom amen that's our portion amen yo stress is not my portion anxiety not my inheritance right nervousness not my inheritance those things are not for us i i i'm repeating this for a point because you gotta really stop because sometimes we get so stressed and worried and depressed and down you gotta realize hold on devil i don't want your experience that's not my experience i went to calvary i got born again the lord transformed my life i'm on the pilgrims highway satan your experience is not my experience so stop trying to give it to me amen it has no part in us hallelujah amen you see it's time that we started walking according to what god has given us brother man says it's a real matching time i'm going to read two quotes that i'm going to go real matching time don't try to match your neighbor match some of the saints in the bible if you're a saint act like a saint walk like a saint dress like a saint talk like a saint pray like a saint believe like a saint shot like a saint be like a saint live like a saint die like a saint go to heaven like you say amen that's how we should be so we should think like a saint i'm more than an overcomer i'm more than a conqueror through him that loved me if god before me who can be against me nothing can be against me every weapon's got to fall every demon power's going to bow to the name of jesus christ amen if god before me who can be against me hallelujah that's how we should think amen the devil's trying to hold the promise of god from your life you say no satan back up in the name of jesus christ he tells you you can't have the holy ghost move in your house he's lying amen if he tells you you can't have a real experience he's lying if he tells you you cannot have an experience that'll keep you forever he's lying i mean he just tells you it's just be another kind of camp experience he's lying see the devil is a liar the reason is it didn't work on him because it can't work on him but it can work on you amen transform your life amen we're just going to read this and i'll as i said i will actually do that now there is no now now there is therefore no condemnation why should the church fair what promises he ever fail to manifest before us what should the church fair church of the living god what should we fear every promise up till this day he's fulfilled right and he's done it well he's fulfilled it to the letter did a virgin conceived she did was he was the christ born he was was he led to calvary yeah at the right age he was did he go down to hell with the sins of the world upon his shoulders he did did he then take the keys of hell death and grave off the devil he did did he roast triumphant he did did he come out of the tomb he did did he put out the holy ghost about pentecost he did amen did he sin malachi 4. he did i mean is he preparing a people for a rapture he is amen so you know he's as good at his word god is as good as his word amen and he doesn't promise something just to not give it he gives exactly what he promises amen but you've got to have a revelation that it is the infallible word of god amen if that same word brought israel out of egypt and put them in the promised land amen that same god that gave that promise will take us in a rapture amen so there's therefore no condemnation why is there no condemnation because you're under the blood if you're under the blood of the lord jesus christ there's no condemnation all sins are confessed it's all done right so why should the church fair what promises he ever felt to manifest before us why should it why should it fear punishment or death why should we fear those things if we've given our life into his hands then no matter what happens praise the lord amen jesus said don't fear the man the one that can destroy this flesh but it is but fear the one that can destroy the flesh and the soul in hell why is it what what can we fear you know that what is that affair of what man can do to me what can he do all he can do is actually make me go to heaven faster if i put it that way don't get to my end destination but it's in god's hands when that time happens should it happen that way so there's nothing to fear see the devil says oh you're going to die who said that that cancer is going to kill your life whose head is going to do you know it's the devil he wants to project his experience so why should it fear punishment or death it has all been overcome here is the mighty conqueror he is the one who conquered both worlds of the scene and unseen not like alexander who conquered the world at the age of 33 and knew no way to turn for further conquest he died a victim of sin and righteous living not like napoleon who conquered all europe but finally was defeated at waterloo and banished to alba only to find himself conquered but nothing could conquer christ he that descended has now ascended above all and unto him that has been given a name that is above every name yes he conquered death hell in the grave and has the keys thereof what he loses is loose than what he binds is bound there's no changing of it there is no conqueror before him and there's none beside him he alone is savior redeemer he is the only god the lord jesus christ is his name he says don't fear john don't fear little flock what i am you are here too all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure that's the devil's job that's his experience he failed in the days of moses he fell in the days of elijah he failed all the way through so i've not come to bring you fear and failure but love courage and ability all power is given unto me and it is yours to use speak the word and i'll perform it that is my covenant and it can never fail hallelujah so i'm going to leave it there i'm going to say this don't be tied into the devil's mental health crisis it is not our portion right we don't have to feel depressed we don't have to feel stressed out and anxious beyond and overwhelmed remember david said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that's higher than i so if you're feeling overwhelmed and nervous all those things say lord lead me to the revelation of who you are who i am and you that's higher than i right now amen and you begin to look and the lord open reveals you again you're my daughter you're my son i've washed you in my blood you're free from the grip of satan i'm taking you you have eternal life you're on your way to heaven that just makes everything else come into balance comes into perspective the lord's got my life he's in control but we have the authority this morning to cast out devils that we don't have to put up with his nonsense yeah and i just finish it with again don't live with the devil's health mental health crisis it's his crisis let him keep it yeah let's walk in joy and love of the holy ghost and peace amen god bless you friends let's have the musicians this morning amen amen not my portion loves my portion joy's my portion peace is my portion faith is my portion hallelujah why because you earned it absolutely not because jesus bought it for me and gave it to me without money or price amen let's sing that song he's a miracle working god shall we this morning amen i'm in the stand shall we no matter what i see no matter
