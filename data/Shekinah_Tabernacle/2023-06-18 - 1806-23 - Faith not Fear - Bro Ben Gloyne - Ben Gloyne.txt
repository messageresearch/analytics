there's no church lunch next door uh Danny's uh he's been unwell for the night vomiting and and you know the saying sharing is caring but not always so we don't want to share that and spread that round so there's no lunch today next door and also just a reminder that the sanctuary is a place of prayer and worship so after service you know have your fellowship in the foyer outside or just just just not in here okay so praise the Lord and then also these um these instruments and things you know they're for the musicians or if you're uh practicing a special especially after service with his lunch going on and things you know children don't come and play with all the knobs and change all the settings yeah this yeah I'll just leave that there anyway so you know just just don't come anyway um God bless you all praise the Lord amen let's let's uh read from judges six and one and we'll go yes I can drive this okay praise God Amen and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of midi in seven years and the Hand of Midian prevailed against Israel uh and because of the midianites the children of Israel made them dens which are in the mountains caves and strongholds and so it was when Israel had sung that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the East even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till they came till thou came unto Gaza and left no sustenance of Israel for Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor s now we're going to drop down to verse 11. uh says and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under uh an oak which is in uh offer that pertained unto Josh the Abba's right and his son a Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him O My Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all that's befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of the midianites and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and now shall save Israel from the hand of the midianites have I not sent thee amen we're gonna just bow he's in a word of prayer this morning if you ever need amen you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen let's just go let's join our faith together and approach the throne of grace this morning gracious Lord Jesus we want to thank you so much because of your blood we can come boldly into your presence today Lord we're so thankful Lord we're not strangers Lord we're not aliens from you oh God but we're your children Lord by your grace and Lord we're so thankful we can say that you're Our Father which are in heaven Lord we want to praise your name this morning give you glory Lord Just Praise you and love you Lord because Lord you do all things well Lord Jesus thank you Lord for conquering whole death in the grave for us Lord thank you for giving us eternal life Lord Jesus thank you Lord for leading us through this dry and weary land we want to pray father as we have read your word Lord may you anoint speaker and hearer one more time and Lord may you burn out all the fear burn out all the unbelief and weary and worry and anything that's not of you oh God take it from us now Lord we open our hearts Lord Jesus and pray Lord you've been the great physician Lord may you may you touch our spirits and take out all that that's not of you father and Lord we want to remember brother Kerry in hospital as well Lord may he continue to be his portion Lord touch his body Lord may not be worried in any way oh God but may he be at rest father may he Grant it in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord anyone else who couldn't be here today Lord of Danny Lord thank you sister Jenny the children next door father be their portion Lord father Lord be their God next door Lord Jesus Lord may they feel your presence even now as they're watching and anyone else who could be watching this service now Lord may your great Holy Spirit go into the room touch the hearts o god father may you grant it for your glory Lord we love you Lord we thank you for this day in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you may have your seats uh this morning so I want to talk about fear or rather faith and not fear hey man it's interesting to read this about Gideon you know we I won't read it to save time but if you go back to chapter five you know that's uh when when Barrack and um and Deborah have their great victory over over cicera and and and the enemies that said and then the and then the land had rest for 40 years and so no doubt Gideon's father you know he was maybe born in that time of risk Gideon was born in that time of rest but then a then a season changed and now the enemy came in and you know started to eat up all their all their food take their crops they didn't have any livestock anymore for you know judging from there from uh uh verse four and you know you see Israel they just made strongholds they went and lived in caves and so basically they just shut themselves away because of the fear of the enemy and how easy is it today where people can be so governed by fear instead of faith that you know they just try and survive through life we're not here just to survive we're here to overcome I mean we're here to be victorious every day because our lord Jesus is Victorious every day everybody see here Gideon you know he just made maybe no doubt you know just got used to living in this kind of a lifestyle and you know there he was threshing weed in secret you know by The Wine Press because of fear of the midianites because he wanted to hide it he was worried if he got caught you know then the enemy's going to come in and take it from him but you know it's amazing how Gideon looked at himself one way but God looked at himself a different way I mean because Gideon did not think himself as a mighty man of Allah but that's what God saw that he was and notice the Lord did not say you will become he said you are and it's the same thing with all the Bride of Jesus Christ every son and daughter of God we are mighty man and woman of Valor boys and girls amen we are Overcomers in this day because of what he has done for us but we can get to a spot where fear rules us instead of faith you know it's very easy you know many times you look at Gideon and you always look for a picture to put up you know it's easy to look at this this moment in the story when they're blowing their trumpets and they break their picture and they shine their light the enemy gets all consumed and destroyed but you know God had to bring them to a place to stand in this position but they already were meant to be in that ordained position but fear had so gripped Israel that all they had was a memory of what God did for them in the past but he was the same God there as he was with Moses he was the same God with Gideon threshing wheat in secret as he was with Joshua but they had forgotten what the lord well they hadn't forgotten what God had done but they forgot that he was a present tense God I mean that could deliver them out of every fan so you know God has to you know we live in a season where fear has gripped the Earth yeah all news is basically bad news these days you know and why because it said that you know the Lord saw through time and saw our season and he said men's Hearts will be failing for fear because why they'll be distress of because upon the Earth there'll be just Earth distress of nations with perplexity and seas and the waves are roaring so so there's problems in the Earth today that cannot be solved there cannot be reconciliation between nations and it's because the demon Over America is fussing with the demon over China and the demon over North Korea is flashing with South Korea and the demon over Japan is fighting with this one and all these different and the demon over New Zealand is trying to back out of it but actually we're we're joined him with the demon in America and in Europe and all these things why because his demon powers fighting and fussing and that causes War so and there's no reconciliation in hell amen there's no peace in Hell demons can't even have peace one with another you're the only way to have peace is when the Prince of Peace comes and takes over and we know before he takes over on the earth he's going to take over in here amen so that's what we need the reason man's hearts are failing them for fear is because they are gripped by fear fear is you know what you know you see so many things these days it's fear is the motivator it's not Faith it's not peace it's not even for a better world they say it is but it's fear you know the climate's changing that's fair you know there's all there's war there's fear epidemics fear health problems fear health and crisis fear economics crashing Fair it's all fair motivating and people can be consumed by it and their hearts fail for fear but I'm so thankful that though we are built the same as everyone else on the street we have someone on the in on the inside of the inside of us that can take the fare away that we can live in this world but not be caught up in the things of this world and we can walk in faith that you can walk into this world with a smile on your face and people can see you and say what's what's going on with that person I want to have what they're on whatever they're on is working for them real good Hallelujah and it's not a pill it's a gospel amen that will change your life forever not just a moment Terry hi amen but an eternal Joy Amen in spite of what's going on now it's incredible when you think about this wind because it's such a contrast in this day where the Lord is here to change us to give us Beauty for Ashes the oil of Joyful morning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness this world is heavy there's a heaviness on people they don't see a way out they don't see a bright day coming you know it's all negative negative negative but actually we have the we have the good news we have the positive news if you are if you are worried about the future if you're fearful for your family if you're worried about where you're going to be maybe next year fear not you know in the Bible it says that phrase fear not or don't be afraid 365 times that's a fair not for every day of the day of the year amen to you wake up you can read fear not amen second of January fear not third of January fear not all the way to December 31st fear not because God doesn't want us to fear amen he wants us to have faith he wants us to have full confidence in him amen not to be worried but sure the world may have a spirit of heaviness but no we have the Garment of Praise I mean we have the oil of Joy amen the anointing of joy is upon the bride of Christ amen we don't meet maybe you have morning but let your morning turn to Joy and maybe you're sad believe your sadness turn to laughing amen let it let it let God change it from the negative into the positive because we know we're human like anyone else we're not exempt from the Troubles of this world we don't live in a bubble right we don't live separated from the troubles we're not immune from the spirit of this age we're not immune from the trouble that it's amazing our Spirits can spread you're an atmosphere can change an attitude can be in a room it can just be a spirit there and you know you know it may start off positive someone else walks in or like a thundercloud and a passive aggressive it can change the whole atmosphere but we don't have to be caught up in that kind of thing we can be positive even though it looks like our world has literally falling apart amen we can you know you say you could have the worst day anyone's ever had even worse than job but see it's the difference between you and job is you know your Redeemer liveth before you step into the trail I mean he didn't know what would happen to him when he died he didn't know even where his children went but after that trial says now I know my redeemer liveth I'll Stand in my flesh I'll see God and on this Earth I'll stand with him see we know that before we've stepped into the trail see all he knew was the sheer blood of the lamb but yet that held him in the trial amen how much more people have the blood of Jesus Christ amen has actually had a visitation from Heaven the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know where you come from and you know where you're going Hallelujah praise God we're allowed to feel anxious we're allowed to feel worried don't no okay let's just get one thing out of our hearts right now if you're scared of something that's that doesn't mean you're not a believer right if you're afraid of something doesn't mean you're not a Believer right because we have the same emotional realm like everyone else right but we have someone who's here to change the whole picture right but we're not meant to live fearful but you may be afraid of something but don't let that fear grip your life don't let it run your life no faith Divine love is meant to run your life I mean to get that out of your mind you say well I'm scared and the devil says well you can't be a believer then he's a liar everything that comes out of his mouth maybe even the truth is still alive why because his motive of giving you the truth what is it just like Adam and Eve his motive of quoting most of the scripture to Eve it was to bring death into the world it wasn't a helper none it wasn't a lift or higher anyway it was to destroy and make them fall from their position so as I say even if the devil's telling you the truth his motivation is evil oh my yeah let's let's have a let's have a bonfire it's winter time it's a good time to have a fire Hallelujah praise God Amen so that's why she didn't do he said it because you know to give them give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness amen that they might be called the Trees of righteous the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified see God wants to be glorified amen see we should never let fear grip us see Timothy was in a place there in second Timothy and you know Paul had to encourage him he was he was a young Minister he was A Gifted Man God had been you know God had been using him he's a genuine believer but it's amazing how how how God will begin to start using someone and automatically the firefighters are there to try and put out that fire to try and dampen enthusiasm to try and just knock them a little bit of a way that the that the fervancy and the joy that they had you know because it's amazing how you know the devil just wants to make everyone the same and we have a tall poppy syndrome here in New Zealand I said there's no cutting poppies in this place if someone's growing I say can I hold on to your branches as you as as you grow up so you can lift me up to where you are you know we should never be jealous remember the Bible says that pilate knew that the scribes and Pharisees had actually given Jesus over to be crucified because of Envy because of jealousy that was the reason you go read it in the gospels the reason they crucified him was because of jealousy why because he wasn't just quoting scripture he was the scripture I mean he was just having a tradition he had something that they wanted but they weren't willing to surrender to get it amens away because their whole religion was based on fear and we'll get into that later but you see it was all fair that gripped them but then here was the prince of peace and they crucified him because of Envy they were jealous amen so he would so Paul would would would be encouraging Timothy he says remember where I uh wherefore I put the in remembrance that thou syrup the gift of God which is only by the putting out of my hands now we know that he would say in previously I can only fit so many scriptures on the board I don't you know I could maybe just put the whole Bible up there but you know it would say before this that the gift that was in your grand grandmother was in your mother's now and you and brother bam said that that gift was not placed in Paul I mean in in Timothy because Paul put his hands on him that's not what it means it means that that gift was actually they could see it operating and they laid hands on him prayed for him and sent him out recognizing the gift was already in him right because you can't impart spiritual gifts by the laying on of hands amen but but Paul is saying remember how there's a gift of God you've got to Stir It Up fear has tried to you Timothy but God doesn't want you to be crippled fear has tried to disable the gift of God in your life Timothy but I'm here to stir up in remembrance that this was in you before you even called no doubt you saw it in your grandmother but he didn't fully understand it you even saw it in your mother you didn't fully even understand that well she'd sit there and at your bedside and preach to you and you know share Bible stories and sing songs and that was a gift of God being manifested that was actually a preaching gift on display but that same gift was in him so Amen to No Doubt when he saw God begin to use his life he would say hey that that was in my mother that was in my grandmother now to me and I didn't put it here amen and if I didn't put it here I can't take it out and if God put it here no one else can take it out so you're going to let God just use the gift that's in your life hallelujah amen so now he says stir up that remembrance right for God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind now Timothy even though he's in the state he didn't quit preaching he didn't quit being a Believer but he just no doubt withdrew within himself because fear had gripped him and how many sadly Believers will be uh in this kind of condition because of fear yet they looked apart they played the part they sing the part but faith is not operating like it should because of fear you know where people come to a place where they're afraid to step out in faith to take God at his word their courage is gone they say well we're praying about it and but it may say plainly in the word to do it but they're afraid to step out and actually step into the unknown God help us that we have courage today Amy remember this goes all over the place I'm not maybe not just talking to you you know just anyway don't take it too personal amen so don't or maybe take it personal hey if God's delivering mail here it is amen but you see the problem is people the I guess curse of prophet says with the Full Gospel people or any is because they are afraid we are not called to be afraid I mean we're called to be full of faith I mean just because the world may be panicking amen doesn't mean we need to panic because we've got a way of Escape amen we've got a way out of here we've got a God that provides all our needs amen he's still Jehovah Jireh just like brother Michael serving Jack said to us around our dinner tablet said you know asked us a question what was the service that brother Brown preached the most I said well maybe yo Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and remember no it's not it's Jehovah Jireh so if you're walking with God God can provide something out of nothing that lamb was I mean that Ram wasn't there when when when uh Abraham walked up the mountain he turned around and saw it in the thicket he walked past that Thicket right but when he was there ready to give give Isaac go go all the way with God God created that Ram in the thicket see so why God is still Jehovah Jireh so let's walk on with God see that's the biggest cursor is on Full Gospel people you know we're Full Gospel people too you know it's not the Breather it's actually the believer right or any other people is because they're afraid God has made provision but we're afraid to take his word for it if you wasn't afraid tonight why you would take your healing by faith and know what God promised it and the thing would be just so Plum far away from you afraid scared and I've noticed pardon me and it's the reason I'm such a believer in healing I know if you can get away from that scare and get love in that place something's going to happen see if you just get that scared because the devil never paints a good picture anyways gives you the worst case scenario basically you're all going to die right now but you know if he if he just cut out his filler and gave you the conclusion that's what he would say you did you're done goodbye this is over finito whatever you know but but the thing is if we start confessing that in every situation we're actually manifesting a spirit of fear we should never confess the negative amen we should always confess positive right we should never confess negative well it's never going to happen and this is always going to be this way and this is going to be the worst ever and you know this year is going to be the worst year of my life no this is the best year of your life where are you closer to the coming of the Lord where are you closer to these bodies being changed amen where are you closer to the dead in Christ raising Hallelujah we are a year closer than we were a year ago to sing our lord Jesus face to face this is a very good year praise God what do you mean well you don't know what I'm going through what does it matter what wrong streets of gold is it going to be in your mind you know Jesus is yeah it says in the Bible he's going to come wipe every tear from our eye and thing is because we're in harmony with them all the tears have to go he's basically got a one big big delete button I mean of all the things that we hold so big and so heavy they won't even be remembered sure we will remember every testimony of everything he did for us in our lives right we're not going to walk up into heaven with a blank mind and not remember anything of the earth we're going to remember some things we're going to remember the day he called us we're going to remember the day his Mercy was new we're going to remember the day that we went off the path and he brought us back we're gonna remember the day when we were sick and he healed us I remember the day we had nothing in our backyard and yet God put something in there wait a minute of the day when he saved our children we remember the day when the Holy Ghost moved in power we're going to remember all those things when we prayed and prayed and prayed and God answered that prayer we're going to remember every single one of those moments because God gives us those testimonies to praise His great name hallelujah amen so we're gonna we're gonna remember some things but there's a lot of things of life we will not remember and God won't remember them either they will be gone [Music] so let perspective's a good thing eh oh yeah just to zoom out you know if you look under a microscope or you're looking at a flee's leg or or it's pincers has you ever seen like those big uh high high resolution images of like the mouth of some little mutt you don't even know existed they look like they could just swallow you a one big gulp but when you zoom out you think where's that guy gone you don't even know where he is but the devil wants to put everything under a microscope make it so much bigger than it really is I mean but under the blood of Jesus Christ what really matters amen and compassion to eternal life and to walk with God and denomin the power of his resurrection Hallelujah The Fellowship of the sufferings what really matters Hallelujah what are you trying to do replace scare with love amen because he found you he ain't gonna lose you I mean he saved you he can't lose you my daddy's bigger than all the daddies in the universe amen holy no one can beat him up no one can hug time no one can pin him down why because my Lord Jesus is greater than them all all the hordes of Hell come pin my Lord G this couldn't hold him the grave couldn't keep him Roman Legions couldn't seal him amen God could not be bound and God will not be bound in this moment either Hallelujah amen but you see now fear fear manifest in different ways see there's only two faculties that govern a human and one of them is Faith which brings results who wants results who's ever had a boss I need results right now what's that Faith that's what fight fight but Faith brings the results see Faith breaks through it's not you bringing the results it's faith that brings results amen it's our faith in the promised word that brings the results it's not our human ability that brings any results and the other is fear which has no value in it at all it's amazing what people put value in there used to be a thing trending on the internet where I cut uh nfts or like I remember the acronym but it's basically virtual art that people solve for digital currency it's not physical it wasn't some famous painting it could just literally be a picture of my phone worth millions of dollars it's like fear the devil puts a lot of value on fear and and he tries to put that value and say this is what it's worth and put it upon you just like those things on the internet but I think the whole thing's crashed and burned and gone but people were spending millions of dollars on things that dividend didn't even exist and that's what the devil does with fear it has no value to it it can't help you none it never did you any good amen it's just like that extra big cheeseburger you ate the other day it didn't help you none right it may have tasted good at the time but hey you still paying for it right now and sometimes fear can actually be people get used to entertaining fear they get used to thinking a certain way I'm not against McDonald's by the way you just spend a bit of time with me we'll be driving through all right we'll go later but you know but the devil puts a lot of value on something that's value-less which is fair I can't help you none amen faith is of God fears of the devil fear makes you weary that's whoever's felt weary tired worn out it's actually a spirit of fear trying to govern your life that's why if you feel hey there's a difference between feeling tired and feeling weary you can feel tired but yet you're still doing you're still going right but but you can have a good night's sleep you can have the best diet whatever but you can still feel weary why it's a spirit of fear trying to drag you down we're not ordained to be weary we're ordained to be happy you know God wants you to be happy whatever age you are God wants you to be happy he wants you to be content he wants you to be loving him he wants you to be positive amen I mean that's what he wants you to be this morning if you're thinking is always negative throw it in the fire take that folder and go go shift delete don't put it in the recycle bin get rid of it and then do a deep clean on your whatever you do with a hard drive that you can't find it after it's been deleted right just get rid of it amen fill your Hardware with Good Things fill it with good programs I mean fill it with good apps right fill it with good word amen positive thinking Amen brother I said we should never think a negative thought we may not be able to stop it coming into our mind but there's some guests you should never entertain we are very hospitable people we are Fellowship junkies all right but there's some people some things we should never fellowship with that's a negative thought that's a negative conversation we should always swing a negative into the positive amen and you'll find people who love Negative they won't talk to you much longer after that that person's always positive that they just they just got blinkers on no no my blinkers have been taken off because I can see from eternity to Eternity so everything's good I know where I came from I know where I'm going I'm not I'm not an ostrich that berries has hit in the sand we see the world's condition we see the trouble in the land we see everything that's going on but yet God is greater than it all and God is in control of everything and we don't need to fear nothing that comes upon the Earth yeah some people say well man you must have a lot of faith to have kids in this day well what about the martyrs and the Dark Ages I that'd be pregnant you know when a pregnant nine months they were living under the danger of being caught their bellies ripped open and the child fed to the Hogs while they bleed to death stuff like that happened by the church by the way Inquisition different things they lived under that fear that that could happen it didn't hinder them they knew people that had happened to it didn't hinder them hey man they kept walking with God they had courage I mean they realized hey my last breath here is my first breath there I mean I knew where they were going they knew where they came from so that so the conditions of the world did not stop them having families raising children having Church sure they are wise about it but you know what I mean they didn't let those things grip them because imagine if we come into service like imagine if we were back there in the Roman era even even during the Cathy or the Reformation or whatever time where this kind of church would be banned and we come to church and there's a prayer request please pray for the Clifford family because they were arrested last night and a few weeks before that I'll just use us the glowing family was arrested they got burned at the stake but yet we'd still come to church we'd still be Believers we couldn't recant because something in US wouldn't let us do it that was him holding us amen something keeps holding me right it's not us it's him but but imagine living in that kind of environment that would be a different kind of every service would be a bit kind of different service you know you would see your brothers and sisters come through the door you take God bless Ed it's so good to see you here again it would mean something wouldn't it I mean to gather together and you know Hallelujah but they didn't let fear grip them they let Faith grip them yeah yeah let's let Faith grip us today let that Faith take control of our lives like never before amen see fear Makes You Weary fear makes you wonder don't wonder what about this and what this may happen this may happen this may happen no no take your thoughts subject to the word of God the Bible says we take every thought captive to the word of God right so fear makes us wonder what's going to happen I wonder what this person is thinking about I wonder what this person thinks about me in this moment what if they saw me just relaxing here for a moment who cares are they your God [Music] no no I'm glad no one said amen people are listening yeah but who are we living before to please amen see if I was going to die in the morning what good would it do me to get all scared up I mean stewed up about it what if I was going to be electrocuted in the morning and my life had to end tomorrow morning what good would it do me to worry about it all right well that's a big statement you've never been there but what good would it do to worry about it well they say what good would it do to have faith faith can sign my pardon yeah sure that's value there's value and Faith don't be wary don't be scared don't be upset just have faith and believe the only thing you can do is have faith you have to have love first for love produces faith for perfect love get it perfect love cast out all fear play perfect love take control say Lord Come Fill Me Lord take fear out of my life Lord you see Lord I've been so caught up in what's going on and there are genuine concerns that we have in life isn't it amen there's not empty things that we're worried about we're worried about genuine things right but they say Lord don't let the fear of what could happen govern my life Lord but may Faith come Lord amen Change My Heart Lord Jesus that I can Rejoice no matter is what's going on what cause faith can sign alpatum you know we're going to realize by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we no longer fear death we no longer feed it the fear of death is gone when Jesus comes in the fear of death leaves amen I remember my well I didn't know at the time but when when when Christine was in Switzerland before we ever met she had an anaphylactic reaction from some Tramadol after a bike accident and and she was actually dying and she felt herself liver body and her auntie is not even a believer was right there and she was crying by a bedside and as she was leaving she just found absolute love and peace and she was and she thought to herself if only I could tell my auntie don't be sad it's so wonderful you can go ask her she'll fill in the details but you see but that's how a Believer is we don't fear death because heaven has come down got a hold of our souls and Heaven's going to carry us away Jesus came down remember when he met you what did he do he put his claim on you and the devil can't kick his claim off he said This one belongs to me they're not your Satan they're mine for eternity they came from me they're going back to me and I can't lose one Hallelujah so you know death is not a fearful thing to the believer why because Jesus Takes all fear of death away well then you may think but what if he's not happy with me what if I failed him we found him every day we need his blood every day some people say there's no more blood I beg to differ I need it amen he's my intercessor he's my mediator amen he's my Advocate amen he's my propitiation He's My All In All without him we have we are lost amen we cannot be a Christian in our own strength brother Brown said you just you know you know if God just took his head off him just for a moment he'd be an absolute wreck yes and the same thing with you and I I mean if God ever just lifts his hand up just lifts his finger off a little bit I mean we're in trouble but God ain't gonna do that God's hand is upon us Hallelujah I trust you believe that about yourself this morning amen see amen and deliver them who are through death uh fear of death we're all their lifetimes subject to bondage what were they subject to all their lives the fear of death yeah basis I've delivered them yeah I've delivered you praise God this is another hypothetical this is reality we don't feed death the only thing that we have a concern for is those we leave behind amen see when you're single there's no one you're going to look after you're like praise God just take me Lord I walk with you and be not you'll just take me but then you think but Lord what if you took me what about my family what about my friends what about my loved ones so you have that burden because the love of God isn't just for ourselves it goes to it goes out to everyone you know see so that's why there's always that in the back of your mind maybe it's just mine Lord if I died right now I know where I'm going but what about my family what about my brothers and sisters what you know what about them Lord go look after us I'm not going anywhere by the way I don't plan on leaving I mean we'll leave together praise God the dead in Christ will raise praise the lord we have to have an open air service throughout 40 days then we're gone I don't know how it's going to be but it's going to be awesome Hallelujah amen we're saying better than WhatsApp to invite the world or to tell you Hallelujah oh my it'll be a shouting time I tell you but the thing is if you've got the Holy Ghost you're sealed to the day of your Redemption your seal to your destination so the ticket in your hand or the holy ghost in your soul it's as good as if you're there already yes why because you've got what you need to get there amen says the Rapture is in you right now if you have the Holy Ghost we get yo people get so scared of oh am I ready well he's made me ready praise God well it says in Revelation but the bride has made herself ready therefore I've got to do something but you read the next verse it was granted to her that she should be a raid in a fine learning clean and white which is the righteousness of saints so it's here so it's like here you are here's a wardrobe put it on yeah see it's there for you to put him right Hallelujah who's wearing the wedding garment who's dressed and ready to go you know people are dressed to travel pack their bags whatever more we're not packing bags we're just getting dressed and we're going carry on luggage only it's only what you wear amen witches Christ himself praise the Lord hallelujah so he's taken he's taken the fear of death from us so what have we got to worry about amen you see now and we're and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us and God is love and he that dwells in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may be bold that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world what is he he's sinless he's perfect he is the word of God Hallelujah he is righteous amen even the angels look dirty inside that's how righteous and holy and sinless is but this is as he is so we are in this world Hallelujah who can lay trash the Godzilla amen give me a chance to you this morning amen the devil can't he's just nothing but a bluff who believes me who's with me today see many times we get so fear of am I is there anything wrong Lord is there any unconfessed sin you know do I need to put something right if there is God will tell you yeah if you really want to know God will show you if you really want to know some people just say they want to know they don't want to know but if you really want to know God will show you you don't have to guess and try and comb through your memories of life and everything no God will bring it up Hallelujah we don't need to worry you said yeah I think some people think I'm just too lazy I'm not lazy in the Lord I've known whom I have believed my confidence is not in this guy [Music] now this can stand quoting if your confidence is in me you have your confidence in the wrong person your confidence should be in Jesus Christ the word I will fail you I'll disappoint you I'll upset you I'll offend you I'll do all kinds of things because I'm human too Hallelujah but he will never disappoint you so you're confident should not even be in this church it shouldn't be in the ministry it should be in Jesus Christ the word right that's who your confidence should be in amen so amen because see we have boldness in the dead judgment because as he is so we are in this world so we're not going to heaven under a death sentence the only one who goes on the death sentence is the devil remember all of a sin from time and before there was time is on his shoulders he'll give an account for the whole thing oh wow he'll say no no this is not my file but God will say no but because of my blood it's your file now now this is being gloin's file yes I don't know because of my blood it's yours you're going to give an account for this file amen and he won't be able to dodge it he can't do any blame shifting up in heaven and the great one third judgment he'll pack it all to Hell upon his own shoulders and burn and pay for it Hallelujah that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does it takes all the sins that we should have been punished for takes it off us transfers us on transfers it onto the head of our accuser and then he takes it to the Lake of Fire and he's punished for all the wrong that's ever been done because he's the originator of it all Hallelujah and we stand undefiled redeemed amen Guiltless perfect in his sight in the sight of God himself amen because fear hath torment of these tormenting thoughts in your mind you've got to realize that's not you that's not God it doesn't belong to you that's not your mail you've been opening the wrong packages right it doesn't belong to you it may feel like it's yours but fear hath torment and fear does not belong to you fear never was meant to belong to the human race do you know that it never was meant to be our portion and you got to realize why do I have this fear because remember uh anything any thought process of the devil it's like a hamster on a wheel there's no conclusion you'll jump on it you'll run through a thought pattern and you'll run through it again and a different angle and you'll feel like a motorbike guy one of those big big orb things going around and around and there's no way out and it's not fun okay that's the devil's thought pattern but God's because he's a counselor he wants to come to a conclusion right so you know God is dealing with you because he comes to a conclusion and that conclusion always is a way of Escape it's not a condemnation it's not like going through a maze you come to a dead end God does not have dead ends he has a way of Escape okay so that's how you know it's God or it's the devil the devil just puts you on a hamster wheel there's no conclusion no way out it just gets worse God gives you a conclusion and there's a way of Escape Hallelujah I'm so glad he's here to get us out amen amen the biggest trouble there is in the church there's a bunch of fear people always scared and that's of the devil don't be scared be brave you don't have there ain't nothing to be frayed about I like that let's not be afraid Hallelujah but you see now fear because it makes a weary it actually makes us forget who we are makes us makes us come to a place of spiritual Amnesia where we don't want nothing spiritual no more see there's something in the people of God that love the spirit of God but if we get into a carnal way we don't want to be nearest presence because a carnal man knows especially a Believer knows that God can come down and speak right to them the preacher could be preaching on something this whole thought can be changed and be speaking right to what you've been talking even driving here or something you've been doing because the word is still a discern of the thoughts and tense of the heart so carnal man will try and hide from where God is moving he'll stay away but yet look like a Believer act like a Believer but won't want to be part of where God comes down into a meeting or to account you know I remember so there's no one here by the way but someone at our last Camp was sitting at the front but on the Sunday night which is where the time of God comes down as Main Service you know because everyone has expectation about it last night right but God's been building building he pours out his Spirit now there's no one here okay so I'm not I'm not looking at anyone but but the the first service is there in the front on that service they are in the back I thought why is this I thought something's not right here because you'd think if you're at the front you stay at the front and if you really want a touch from God you'll be at the front if you can yeah yeah but you see a cardinal man will try and hide from that outpouring he'll especially when there's a gift like brother kaijo will go and pray for someone and discern exactly what's going on in their lives as he's praying they'll hide from that thing so so what happened but why is that because of fear which makes it weary which is like then it makes it what does it do it it produces it at Amnesia that people don't want something that's spiritual show about quote the prophet they'll read the Bible and listen to the message they'll come to church but I don't want the spiritual side the anointing of God to come down and touch your hearts who wants God to touch their heart today I want God to change me Lord if I need be exposed expose me Lord if I got sin in my life that you need to deal with Here I Am Lord I mean I think it's because it's all for our good amen amen praise the Lord but you see fear comes in when there shouldn't be fear see man wasn't made to feel fear it's amazing when you think about the first time man ever felt fear was in the Garden of Eden after the fall they had never felt this emotion before they had never felt fear that never had worry they never had any kind of feeling of what will happen when I come into the presence of God they only felt joy and love and peace and that longing because brother and said you know God would come down in the cool of the evening and he'd have church with his children and they go to the great Cathedral under the great big trees there and you know they'd be waiting for God to come down then he'd step into the garden and they'll hear the voice of God walking through the garden and no doubt excitement would rise Here Comes father we had such a great day in the garden now we can tell them all about it now we can be in his presence like never before and experience him in a greater way and and he'll talk to us and he's going to speak to our hearts and our hearts is burn and we just love it so much when he speaks and but this day was different why because sin had cometh and the new church was gonna they knew the church doors were going to open up because God always comes to church he's always on time and now they begin to feel Panic they don't even know what this emotion is but now they're panicking we're naked we're going to do something about this so they've hastily grabbed fig leaves try and cover up their nakedness and then they and then and then they hear the voice of God walking through the garden Adam because God stepped into church and he was surprised that no one was there because they had medieval ways in church but he walked in the door he goes to see where they always sit because everyone has their favorite seat but those seats were empty that day and now God knew exactly what happened he wasn't surprised but God always comes down to our level to talk to us so now now they were now they were you know they were all worried and stressed because they had to cover their nakedness but then now when they heard the voice of God that voice that used to bring such a joy and a love would sweep over them without hear his voice now it produced fear you think about the first time man ever felt fear was because of the presence of his maker it wasn't because of the devil it wasn't because of hell it wasn't because of Torment it was because of the God who made them came into their presence and this is why they are afraid the very one you know you know all God wants to do is pick us up tell us he loves us tell us he cares about us you know he doesn't want to kick us down some hole somewhere he's not ashamed of any of us doesn't matter what state we think we're in or what we're in he just wants to pick us up say child I love you child you're mine I care about you I've been longing looking for you just come up here tell me all about it I'll make it right he's already actually made it right by the blood the amen of Jesus Christ but they hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God and he says and Adam would say I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid he felt Fair because of the voice of God but God doesn't want us to be afraid see but fear will make us hide things yeah yeah they were still Believers in God they were still Believers of the message Believers of the hour if I can put it that way but because fear had gripped them they didn't want to be in his presence we should always love to be in the prince of God remember it was God running after Adam not Adam running after God when he fell and so God still seeks seeking us out we may look the part we may sing the part we may play the part but what's going on on the inside God wants to deal with the Inside Man Hallelujah amen but you see there's many fears we'll come back something else now I don't know if you can read that there's a fear of failure people are afraid to fail everything's got to be perfect it's got a their life has to be perfect their house has always got to be clean the garden's always got to be done their car's always got to be clean they've always got to have the best clothes you know they can't look like they they are afraid of someone sees them that they don't have it all together and they're living under fear well I'm just a perfectionist don't let it be a fear don't let it be actually Fair motivating your life amen there's a fear of what others say about them now peer pressure is a real demon that is a real demon especially in the teenage years even in the 20s you know because you haven't found who you really are yet peer pressure is a demon it is not of God it never was of God never will it's it's a demon Spirit trying to get you to be like everyone else we should but then even people on the on the mess on the religious side people are afraid what will others say about them if if I don't have it all together what will they say if my kids are actually being children we don't want robots we want kids you hear what brother Brown says about Joseph and his you know he's a real boy doing all these things and the girls were real girls you know they weren't robots why do we but but but we can get under a fear of what others will say about us and you know how our family is doing hey sometimes brother bam says we'll go through seasons sometimes the family's going real good it's the summer time but sometimes there's trouble after trouble it's a night season there comes into a day season again see we all go through Seasons but we shouldn't be living under fear of what people will think about us and our families hey we're human man we need the grace of God we don't have it all together I have I don't have it all together praise God is that all right to say you know we're going to realize we don't have it all together but he always has it all together and he's the one we're depending upon people have a fear of a loss of reputation oh my you know because they've got to have an image they've got to project but it's actually this doing it out of fear fear of being made fun of this causes people to shrink within themselves they don't want to step they don't want to be themselves you know it's amazing especially when I was growing up and I think it's still the same people want to dress different to be unique because everyone does it and they actually have the same style they end up looking all the same I'm gonna set my own fashion trend next minute it's everyone and you're the last one to actually jump on board but you just thought man I'm going to be I'm going to be an individual who's he met it's every generation Has It by the way fear of being made fun of fear of change Gideon got used to threshing wheat there in secret and change Mindy had to step out yeah I mean I mean you can even ask the question why did an angel need to come to him and tell them to go do this he was a circumcised son of Abraham living in the Promised Land why did he need an Angelic visitation it's because he got used to living the way he was yet he was a believer yet he said well if God is with us where's the miracle is a very good way brother Graham said about um you know very good question to ask but yet he had to step out and courage to change his situation see God doesn't push us through a pipe and make us overcome program says that no we have to be willing to have courage to actually step out and say change my life Lord I'm not going to be the same person Lord you've got to change me I'm not going to stay in the same way amen fear of the unknown people are scared of the unknown some people think yo you know a comfort zone we know over time gets smaller right and the reason most children are happier is whether because they're always pushed out of their comfort zone go play this sport go do this class you know you never I mean you know there's some years where you choose your subjects but pardon me most years you you just give us something to learn and now we're going to do this and you know but you're always pushed out of your comfort zone but then as you become an adult your comfort zone gets less and actually people uh they've done studies that find that people actually live less fulfilled lives because their comfort zones get smaller and they're not going out beyond their comfort zone yeah and that can be a fear well I've never done this before I've never you know you know imagine a kid uh at school how many times a day would they say well I've never done this before of course you've never done this before you're learning you're growing but when does the learning and growing stop I'm not talking about sitting in a class for a whole day for the rest of your life but you know there's situations in life you say man I've never come across this before of course you haven't praise God it's new but don't drink in yourself saying I'm afraid of this actually no take it by the take the ball by the horns I admit anyway anyway we'll we'll leave that alone I'll be watching when you do it we'll be praying too good luck oh my but you know the fear of confessing their wrongs because what will people now a lot of this feeds into one another but people are afraid of actually confessing to God that they're wrong because that takes us three to that takes a you know that takes a vulnerability and then there's a fear of making their wrongs right well if I confess this then I've got to do this and this has got to happen and but all the guilt will be gone yeah you won't have to you'll ever you'll be able to sleep at night that's a good trait amen the fear of finding out what's wrong with their health people are afraid to go to doctors they have a pain they say no I'm just believing I'm not even going to look for it but David when he came came against Goliath he says who is this uncircumcised philistine he wanted to know his name and say thank God this thing's going down amen so it should be the same thing with you and I if there's something wrong in our bodies we shouldn't be afraid to go to the doctor we say well I don't trust them at least they could diagnose what's wrong with you so you'll get a name to pray against amen but the thing is people say well there's a lot of crack doctors these days well there's a lot of quack homeopaths too so you got whatever you do you've got to do it in faith you can't be like what yo what if God wants to use medicine but you're not willing to use it yeah and God because but God wants you to actually actually trust him because we can't put God In The Box we can't come to God with our preconceived ideas and call it faith you know because some people and they're not in this room again people have shared health conditions and they lay on their bed afraid of what it could be and the devil tells them you're gonna die and they live in fear but they won't go to the doctor to get a name that's not faith I said but they're believing God and they're gonna again they're not in this room okay that's not Faith that's fear we should not be afraid if I woke up tomorrow morning as I'm crippling pain I'm gonna go find out what it is is that okay I'm not a you know I'm not a hypochondriac I've had our Medical Center contact me saying do you still want to be on the records you haven't come in enough I'm not that sick but if I'm sick I'm you know I'm really gonna go are we together right but people get afraid of what could it be the devil says well it's it's cancer it may be but brother Ram says real overcoming is recognizing your enemy and knowing the one in you has already overcome it that's real overcoming says that's perfectly sensible right so we should never bury our head in the sand if something's going wrong what's its name good now I've got a name now we pray your duty to go to the doctors you gotta have faith in what you're doing we don't have fear we don't live out of fear eh right well this could happen this conspiracy this guy hey the whole world is controlled by the devil the Bible says so yeah I'm sorry that's just how it is but God is greater than him right and if the devil could have destroyed us he would have done it a long time ago and if we go when God or dangers to go then that's our time to go that's right nothing can take us to our purpose and on the earth is done praise God don't think I'm blase about these things I'm not not being blase but where's your faith or is it fear see fear can be veiled in a in a very Christian way oh I'm praying about it but they're not doing anything about it they're not putting their faith into action not letting their footsteps be ordered because remember the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord but they cannot be ordered unless you're moving see fear of failure but what if I'm not doing the perfect will of God God will bring you unto his perfect will amen amen right but you can't if you're standing there growing moss and you're growing tree roots because you're not moving God can't direct those steps right but if your heart is off saying Lord remember brother Brown me he was he was lost on Hurricane Mountain you know his wife his child was there in the in the lean to whatever there's a storm coming through and he prayed sincerely he says I believe it's this way and then he was walking that way he fell the head on her shoulder he turned around there's a gap in the Gap in the storm he saw he was going the wrong way but he was still walking what if he said well I'm just going to stand here that would have been the end of it see you've got to be just sincerely seek the Lord and walk and if God says no turn this way you turn praise God don't ever fear a failure amen but you see now we need courage in this day courage is a so Webster says courage is a mental or moral strength I hope yeah I'll wrap this up soon to venture persevere and withstand danger fear or difficulty that's what courage takes see it's very easy to be like if you're in a battlefield to be hid in a trench or a foxhole it's easy to be there still dangerous but it's easy but it's those that go over the top and attack their enemy that takes courage that takes a courage to be exposed to enemy fire right but see we've got to have courage in this day like never before because man's hearts are failing for fear I mean so now it's interesting with Joshua Joshua we know was ordained to take the children of Israel and place them in the land now I just you know I'll just very quickly looking last night God never told Moses to be to have good courage but then when Joshua comes on the scene God would tell him three times to be strong and be and be of a good courage or be thou strong and be very courageous why because you're going to need courage Joshua you're going to come into things that you've never experienced before you're going to come against enemies you've never seen before apart from when you spied out the land you need courage you need courage when things happen among the children of Israel that can you stand on my word or will you compromise and fail see we need courage in this day amen to stand and take God in his word amen don't be says Don't Be Afraid neither be thou dismayed now this word dismay it means it means to properly to prostrate so that means to bow down to break down or figuratively to be brought down by confusion or fear see we shouldn't be dismayed when something happens then we actually bow ourselves before that thing we're not here to prostrate ourselves before fear or even any demon complex or whatever it is we're here to prostrate ourselves before the Living God then God will mold us into his very image see people who are fearful embody that fear they manifest that fear they speak negative something comes up it's just bad bad sad gloomy trouble that's fear right but people who actually have faith they say no this may all be so but yet God rich and mercy will take care of me in this situation you see Caleb and Joshua saw the same Giants at the other ten spies saw but they say let's go take it right now yep it's there they agreed both all 12 agreed until what but but on one point they disagreed the 10 said we can't do it the two said we can take it because God's given it right so that was courage that was Faith the other ones were living under fear we're grasshoppers in their sight they never ask that question they never handed out a survey they didn't go door to door and you know what do you think of us but they just kind of made that idea and said well man we're just grasshoppers grasshoppers by the way eat up the land they moving they chew up everything yeah they were ordained to take it but yet fear gripped those 10 spice and they begin to prostrate themselves before that fear we can't do it yet they are believers they are in the message of the hour they are in church but they were Fair gripped them that they couldn't take the next step we should be very willing to take every step we have a fear of not being perfect fear of consequences every action has a reaction fear of leaving their old life behind you got to burn that thing up you can't speak of your old life and pride if you are proud or think anything good of your own life you're still attached to that thing and it'll drag you back but if you see it for what it is like the Apostle Paul said I can all things but don't that I may win Christ is another Pharisee of the Pharisees he could have thought man there were Banquets in my honor their award ceremonies in my honor my pleasure at school had all the badges on it you know I had all the degrees on my wall you know he could say man I I haven't talked Amelia a thing or two I asked him some questions I never thought of that before and wow no he counted all but done hey and that's what we're going to be willing to do amen but people are afraid because why your identity's got to change the Rich Young Ruler was afraid to leave his old life behind and he went back to their old life people are afraid of the new birth brother Bram said even Bradham Tabernacle is getting afraid of being born again that's the thing we need we need a new birth we need a baptism after baptism we need God to come down and take over our services to change our hearts you know many things see the reason the reason we get stuck in sin is because of sin nature no matter how much we want to do better that's the Nature's got to be burnt out of us amen he's got to change the desires in our life amen it's not turning over a new Leaf God's going to change our desires amen we're going to be born again amen but there's a fear of not being in control what if I shout what if I run the aisle what if I speak in tongues you have to be willing to do those things you may not do any of those things but you could get to a place where you don't care no more like well I can't remember what we're listening to but your brother man tells that story of that of that colored brother there in um in in America and his boss already so happy all the time they said well what happened he says well I got old-time religion you know and then one day his boss says I want to get it so they go to a nice big Hayloft and then and then but but then the brother who had the you know really had the Holy Ghost said you don't get it here then they go to a meadow you don't get it here they go to some place you don't get it here he says well where do you get it then he rolls up his trouser legs walks out into a pig pen kneels down but the boss doesn't go in and then he looks up says and you're coming in he says no I'm not going there he says well you're not ready to get it yet see you have to be willing praise God you ought to be willing wherever you know see see people are so afraid to let the Holy Ghost take control of their lives because of well what will this person think it'd be well if they're actually Spirit-filled they'll they'll celebrate with you amen they'll they'll Rejoice with you and you never know what what God does in your life may just spread to everyone and a Revival might break out just because of you letting God use you you know the Welsh Revival really started because a young sister got up and said Lord be glorified in me and it's back to Revival of a hundred thousand people came to Christ because of one young sister got up and said that in a meeting amen what if she didn't do it but she did Hallelujah Hallelujah see so we should not be afraid of what what people will say who cares they can have their opinions second opinions is quite a big book I don't read it delete oh block you know but you see we should not be afraid of those things we should let God be God amen we should let God be God now see how many ministers could God use this morning if that only that God bind them with his word and with his power now what about you and I because all of these kind of quotes when I read them I never actually put them out there I always bring it in here you know what if God would bind us with his word and his power what could happen What could happen in our lives what could God do he can do the unlimited he said well the Revival's over no it's not amen God don't call people no more yes he does yes he does Mercy's over no it's not you know we just we're just occupying time till he comes we're not just sitting around we're not sitting in a departure Lounge in an airport at 5am waiting for a plane to come no God is here to gather more there might be more lost in there you know more that need to come in than already in oh but it's late in the hour that's fine you know I'm not worried about that but you know why would we you know God could do why don't we just let God do what he wants to do Hallelujah see what would happen and loose them from the strength of them organizations and denominations or from Fear if we just let God do what he wants to do oh but I'll be rejected he was rejected that I'd be accepted he was wounded that I'd be healed he died a sinner that I'd be righteous right he died in shame that I'd have no shame praise God Amen Hallelujah see we I'm just going to read a few of these see see what's the trouble with the church today is scared to death are you going to make a failure how can you fail when you're in Christ you can't fail I like that you can't fail if you're in Christ you've got everlasting life all demons in hell can't shake you you've got everlasting life Jesus said so so don't be scared of failure you say well I'm afraid I'll get phonetic I'd rather have a little fanaticism than sit still and do nothing amen praise God I'm sure would a man that's going to do something is told about the ballads up here fellow come to get a job from him and he said sign your name here he took his pencil to sign he said where's your eraserat said I don't I don't make no mistakes he said well I can't use you and you ain't going to do nothing that's right you don't make no mistakes you're not gonna do nothing I mean you're not doing nothing see we're going to get what this fear of failure out of our Lives they say well what if I witness to someone wrong just tell them how your fire got lit you know we don't have classes seven steps to witness to people just share what's real with you live a life that actually the Lord is awesome Jesus Christ is amazing I'm alive in him he washed all my sins way I'm not worried about this world because I know where I'm going we have a Blessed assurance Jesus Is Mine Hallelujah we should be happy eh praise God we've got it all amen now what's this master teacher Paul the first thing he does is knock out all the idea of failing Falling Away knock out the idea of ever being a Christian today and tomorrow I'm Gone the next day God condemn me and next time back again that's nonsense amen where to get this fear out of our hearts that we're going to be lost tomorrow no if he found me he's going to keep me amen right I'm never out of his care sure I may step out alone but he brings me back Hallelujah so we're going to get this because we get so worried am I going to make it he made it for me amen he he made it for me so I can rest in his salvation is his blood enough today in your life and your heart is his salvation enough amen it should be actually no it's more than enough amen it doesn't just meet the challenge it overcomes the challenge amen why because his grace is so great it overcame my own selfish stubborn nature and pride Hallelujah so if God could do that in my life he's not going to do that just to cast me away amen you say well what about the children of Israel in the wilderness I'm not one of them I'm in the Caleb and Joshua outfit amen amen so don't you you say well I've fallen away God is here to restore you amen you say well I've failed miserably get back up it takes courage to get back up he said I've been wandering for years you know doing nothing for God not even living for him just say Lord here I am I'm done you know there's a uh you know a book we uh um I read to the kids ages ago a Tanglewood secrets and I think I see it in Wales or Scotland somewhere and that's where they use gorse actually or hedges for fences and doesn't grow like it does here it actually stays where it should be and um and and the um like I remember saying it but they said you know lambs and things they get you know you know they start eating grass near the hedges and then their wool gets caught in the gorse or the Hedge and they can't pull themselves free but they only they only are found by the shepherd when they start calling out because they can be stuck in a hedge somewhere you can't even see them with a naked eye interface you know stand there and they're wrestling and they're pulling saying well I can do this and I'll be okay and I can manage this sin and this is not so bad and you know I can look here and this is just how I'm meant to be the shepherd can't find them but if they just begin to call one time because the ship is looking he's got a certain number of sheep and if one's missing he's not happy with well fifty percent of passing grade not without Jesus 100 he wants he wants us all home right but it's only when so so the shipper can be wandering up and down paddocks trying to look along hedgerows but it's when the Sheep begins to bleat yeah but why does the Sheep stop bleeding because it stops fighting it stops trying to free itself it stops trying to fix its own situation because it realizes it can't and the sooner we get to that predicament we realize we can't help ourselves we can't free ourselves we're just making matters worse then we can start to call out the father God and he'll reach down his hands and pull us up out of that hitra and say I've been looking for you Hallelujah amen so just get all this fear out of our hearts say Lord your love is perfect what are we scared about amen whatever it is don't be scared God's invited you to take a hold of the wings of the Cross and this Bible here God's promise and fly away Into the Blue he said I wasn't up there before brother Branham whole to him and he will take you up there she just hold on to the Cross he'll fly you away Hallelujah we don't need to be scared about anything so don't let fear govern your life friends let Faith take control amen can we have the musicians please this morning amen don't be governed by fear you say well I'm just trying to survive life and I'm worried about brother or sister so and so say about me and I'm worried about people thinking don't worry about those things just be yourself let God be God yeah but what will people think of me well if you're really a human people think of you more people are looking for something real we want to be real Christians well I want to be real we don't want to be robots and everything's fine and you know because we can be screaming on the inside just like a sheep in a hedge but that scream's got to come out that Christ's got to come out so I'm hurting I'm struggling that doesn't mean you're not a believer I've got this pain in me I'm really battling with something that doesn't mean you're not an overcomer right but you can't bother in you've got to tell God about it what will he think about me he already knows about it before you ever had that trouble or that complex that pain or whatever it is he purchased the Redemption of you on Calvary before it ever came in July before you ever came to the Earth he made a way amen so let's um let's sing let's stand this morning I want to sing that song fear's a liar I thought that was so
