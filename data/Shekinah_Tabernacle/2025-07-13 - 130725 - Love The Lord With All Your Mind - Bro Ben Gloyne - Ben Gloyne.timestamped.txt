[2:30] [Music]
[3:01] Good morning.
[3:03] It's good to be here. It's good to
[3:07] It's always good to worship the Lord.
[3:08] It's always good to um have the
[3:11] opportunity to push the kingdom of God
[3:13] forward, to put our energy into
[3:16] something that's um eternal and
[3:18] everlasting.
[3:21] We have a certain amount of time and we
[3:22] have a certain amount of energy and we
[3:24] have a certain amount of talents. And I
[3:27] think it's good that we align those
[3:29] three to push the kingdom of God forward
[3:33] in some way, shape, or form, which most
[3:36] of you, all of you do. Do you all do
[3:38] that?
[3:40] You all, you know what your talents are?
[3:42] You know what your gifts and callings
[3:44] are? Yep. And you do and you use those
[3:47] for the Lord.
[3:49] You know, it's like we your first our
[3:53] first problem we have as human beings is
[3:54] our the salvation problem. You know,
[3:56] that's our first thing we have to deal
[3:58] with is you know the the state of our
[4:00] soul. There's no point doing anything
[4:02] for the Lord if your soul isn't right.
[4:04] You know, but there is a point you you
[4:05] get a few things.
[4:08] So we settle that problem first as our
[4:10] eternal destination, making our getting
[4:13] our soul clean,
[4:16] you know, and and saving our soul,
[4:19] taking that that that blot of sin that's
[4:21] in our that's in us, taking that away
[4:24] and receiving the spirit of God. That's
[4:25] our that's that's priority number one,
[4:29] you know. Then we then we go from death
[4:32] to life in our soul.
[4:35] But then after that, we're still alive
[4:38] and we still have time. We have energy.
[4:40] We have things. And then then the next
[4:42] most important thing for a Christian is
[4:44] find out what are my gifts and what is
[4:46] my calling, Lord? Why on earth am I
[4:48] still alive? Why am I here? You're not
[4:52] here to just live and do a job and make
[4:57] ends meet and do whatever. You're not
[4:59] here for that. You've got a calling and
[5:01] a purpose. You've got a reason why
[5:02] you're here and you've got a place to
[5:05] fill.
[5:07] And
[5:08] I think as a Christian and me in my
[5:11] life, my priority number one when I
[5:14] really became a Christian was what on
[5:15] earth am I here for? And I didn't stop.
[5:19] I I I was quite aggressive in how I did
[5:21] things. But that's how I do things. I
[5:22] just I didn't care if I felt like I
[5:25] should be doing something. I just went
[5:26] ahead and did it. If it all messed up, I
[5:28] thought that's fine. I know I'm not
[5:29] supposed to do that anymore. But at
[5:31] least I didn't have a question. I don't
[5:33] have any questions. I have no regrets
[5:34] because I've aggressively pursued Lord,
[5:37] what do you want me to do?
[5:40] And I think, you know, I I I think
[5:42] there's grace from the Lord. If we want
[5:43] if if our mission is to try and find
[5:45] that, you know, just some people stand
[5:47] back a bit too much and they think, I
[5:49] don't know if I should, enough, I
[5:50] shouldn't just go and do it, man. If it
[5:52] doesn't work, then don't do it anymore.
[5:55] But brother Brandham always said, he
[5:56] said, "I'd rather have someone that goes
[5:58] out and tries and does something and
[5:59] fails and someone just sits back and
[6:01] criticizes and doesn't do anything, you
[6:03] know." So, you've all got a special
[6:05] place in the kingdom of God and you've
[6:06] got between one and five talents. And if
[6:08] you use if you've got five and you use
[6:10] those, you could end up with six or
[6:12] seven or eight or nine or 10.
[6:15] So, let's stand this morning and let's
[6:16] um let's worship the Lord and let's um
[6:19] let's give a for the kingdom of God
[6:20] today. Let's enter in. Let's let's just
[6:23] call upon the spirit of God this morning
[6:24] Lord. We just want to call upon you Lord
[6:27] and we thank you that
[6:29] Lord that as a sign of gratitude towards
[6:33] you Lord we can present ourselves a
[6:35] living sacrifice to you this morning
[6:36] Lord and and give you our life to song
[6:39] says Lord I give you my heart I give you
[6:41] my soul Lord we can give you our life
[6:43] this morning we can give you our time we
[6:44] can give you our energy as you said thou
[6:46] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[6:47] soul with all thy strength with all thy
[6:50] might Lord and we just love you this
[6:52] morning with everything that we have
[6:53] Lord we pray you'll be glorified in this
[6:55] morning, Lord. And we're here because we
[6:57] not because we've been dragged along to
[6:59] church, but we're here because we love
[7:00] you and we've made a choice to be here,
[7:02] Lord. We've chosen to be here and
[7:04] worship you this morning, Lord. And we I
[7:07] don't regret my choice, Lord. And I
[7:09] don't think anyone here regrets their
[7:10] choice. We're happy with our choice,
[7:11] Lord, to follow you and to serve you,
[7:13] Lord. So, we just pray you'll bless our
[7:15] service this morning. May you just
[7:16] minister to us through your word, Lord,
[7:18] through Brother Ben, and through the
[7:19] music and everything. We just want to

[11:26] [Music]
[11:27] Alas, and did my Savior bleed and did my
[11:34] sovereign die?
[11:37] Would he devote that sacred head to such
[11:43] a one as I would at the cross? At the

[12:12] groaned upon the tree.
[12:17] Amazing
[12:18] pity, grace unknown, and love beyond
[12:24] decree. Oh, at the cross, at the cross,

[23:42] The future sure the price that has been
[23:47] paid
[23:50] for Jesus paid
[23:53] and suffered for my heart.

[24:02] grave.
[24:04] To this I
[24:07] sin has been defeated.

[24:42] Jesus.
[24:45] For he has said
[24:48] that he will bring me home.

[24:56] I know he will renew
[25:01] until I stand
[25:03] with joy before the throne.

[42:07] you all. Good morning, everyone.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to see you all here today.
[42:11] Amen. Let's um let's go to the scripture
[42:13] this morning. We're going to go to
[42:14] Matthew chapter 22 and verse um we're
[42:17] going to read verses, we're just going
[42:19] to read verse 37. Then you can
[42:22] have your seats this morning. Trust
[42:23] everyone's had a good week.
[42:26] Trust some of you have had a good week.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; You know, every day is good.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; This is the day the Lord has made. We
[42:33] will rejoice and be glad in it. And the
[42:35] scripture says, "Let everything that has
[42:36] breath praise ye the Lord." So if you
[42:39] got life in your body, praise ye the
[42:42] Lord.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:45] Being down and out has helped nobody.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, so why be down and out?
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Might as well be courageous and happy
[42:52] and rejoicing. Amen. So let's um let's
[42:54] go here. So we're going to read one
[42:55] verse. says, "Jesus said unto him, "Thou
[42:59] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[43:01] heart, with all thy soul, and with all
[43:03] thy mind."
[43:05] &gt;&gt; It's not the size of the scripture that
[43:07] counts. It's what's in there. And his
[43:08] word is eternal. Amen. So, let's bow our
[43:10] heads in a word of prayer. Amen. You
[43:12] have a need. We'll have needs this
[43:13] morning. Amen. Let's lift them before
[43:15] the Lord with with confidence, with
[43:16] blessed assurance. Amen. Gracious Lord
[43:20] Jesus, how thankful we are. We can say
[43:22] truly the King is alive, Lord. And it's
[43:25] more than just the fact that we could go
[43:26] to Jerusalem and see an empty tomb,
[43:28] Lord. But the fact is your presence is
[43:30] among us, Lord. You're quickening your
[43:32] word to our souls. You're increasing our
[43:35] faith. You're driving the enemy away,
[43:37] dear God. You're walking, Father, among
[43:39] us. And I pray this morning. May you
[43:41] walk among us. May our hearts be
[43:43] completely open, Lord, that you can come
[43:45] and touch our lives, dear God. Walk,
[43:47] walk in this place. We invite you to
[43:49] church, Lord. We invite you to everyone
[43:50] who's streaming as well, dear God. my
[43:52] darling at home. Go and touch her,
[43:54] Father. Lord, anyone else who's unwell,
[43:56] who couldn't be here because of sickness
[43:57] or traveling. And we also want to
[43:59] remember brother Ompomp who's
[44:00] ministering at brother Moses today.
[44:02] Lord, fill his mouth with your words,
[44:03] Lord, for the people there, dear God.
[44:05] Bless the service there and have your
[44:07] way among us. We love you. We thank you
[44:09] for this day. We plead your blood over
[44:11] our lives, Lord. Cover us and hide us
[44:13] under the shadow of your great wings,
[44:15] Lord, this day. We're so thankful for
[44:16] that security, Lord. We love you. We
[44:18] commit the service into your hands in
[44:20] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[44:22] bless you. You can have your seats uh
[44:24] this morning. So, I want to I want to
[44:27] just take this scripture here and
[44:31] it's interesting where the Lord is told
[44:34] and maybe we're just going to zoom out
[44:36] to the um to the whole passage here. It
[44:38] says where it says then one of them
[44:40] which was a lawyer asked him a question
[44:42] tempting him and saying master which is
[44:44] the great commandment in the law. Jesus
[44:46] said unto him, thou shalt love the Lord
[44:48] thy God with all thy heart, with all thy
[44:50] soul, with all thy mind. This is the
[44:51] first and great commandment. The second
[44:53] is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy
[44:55] neighbor as thyself. On these two
[44:58] commandments hang all the law and the
[45:01] prophets. So it's interesting. Here
[45:02] comes a lawyer. You know, lawyers are
[45:04] technical people. They want to get you
[45:05] on a technicality and twist you a
[45:07] certain way. And you know, so maybe the
[45:08] lawyer would um say, you know, maybe in
[45:11] his mind was thinking one of the we call
[45:13] the ten commandments or something. But
[45:14] but the Lord, well, he is the lawgiver.
[45:16] Amen. He encapsulated it down to these
[45:19] two things. Love the Lord with all thy
[45:21] heart, soul, and mind, and love thy
[45:23] neighbor as thyself. So the whole word,
[45:25] the whole word hangs on these two
[45:28] commandments. That's how important these
[45:30] things are. The whole word, not part of
[45:32] the word, the whole word. But I want to
[45:34] really focus on this with all by mind.
[45:37] We should love the Lord with all our
[45:39] mind, all of our thinking, our mental
[45:41] faculties. It's very important
[45:42] especially in this age we live in as
[45:44] such a mind age. Mental health crisis
[45:47] and all these troubles that are upon the
[45:49] earth and tension and anxiety. It's all
[45:51] in the mind is the battle. But the Lord
[45:55] told us we should love him with with all
[45:58] of our mind. Now I put this up here.
[46:01] This is um what what that picture is on
[46:04] the right if you're wondering what it
[46:05] was is an aerial view of a section of
[46:07] trenches in World War I. Because the
[46:10] battlefield we have today is in the
[46:13] mind. Now, brother Bram would say this
[46:15] here uh and this is the greatest battle
[46:17] ever fought. It says in the first world
[46:19] war it was so placed in no man's land
[46:21] places where they fought and they got to
[46:23] a place um got to a place selected like
[46:27] when Israel went to war with the
[46:28] Philistines and there was a hill on each
[46:31] side where they gathered and there where
[46:33] Goliath came out and called to the
[46:35] armies of Israel and where David met him
[46:36] in the valley where he passed over the
[46:38] little creek that run between the two
[46:40] hills he picked up the rocks there has
[46:42] to be a place selected and in this and
[46:44] in this there's a mutual ground in no
[46:46] man's land and they fight here at this
[46:48] place. They just don't one fight over
[46:50] here and one down here and one over
[46:52] there. There's a battlefront where they
[46:54] meet and test their powers where each
[46:56] army test its strength against the other
[46:58] army. A mutual meeting place. He says
[47:00] now don't miss this. So when he says
[47:02] something like that, we should not miss
[47:03] what he's saying. I mean when this great
[47:06] battle started on earth, there had to be
[47:08] a mutual meeting place. There had to be
[47:10] a place selected for the battle to begin
[47:12] and for the battle to rage. And that
[47:14] battle grounds begins in the human mind.
[47:17] There is where the battle starts. The
[47:19] human mind was chosen for the place of
[47:21] the battle where it was begun. And this
[47:24] is because that decisions are made from
[47:27] the mind, the head. So I'm just going to
[47:29] readjust myself here a bit from the
[47:32] head. Now it never started from some
[47:34] organization. They never started it from
[47:37] some mechanical affair. The grounds
[47:38] never started there. Therefore, the
[47:40] organization can never never do the work
[47:42] of God because the battle grounds where
[47:44] you've got to meet your enemy is in the
[47:46] mind. You've got to make your choice. It
[47:48] meets you. So there's a battleground
[47:50] that is your mind. Now your mind, I want
[47:52] to put it out to begin with. Your mind
[47:55] is not no man's land. Brother Bam said
[47:57] it's like a no man's land. It's a mutual
[47:59] meeting ground. Even in Papa New Guinea,
[48:01] uh not that long ago, they had mutual
[48:03] battlefields between villages. They
[48:05] actually had like a village oval or a
[48:07] cricket pitch we call it today or a
[48:09] soccer field where they would go fight.
[48:11] They had a mutual place. This is where
[48:13] we battle. And now the Lord allowed the
[48:16] devil to to meet him in the mind of man.
[48:21] So it's very important you got to
[48:22] realize that your your mind is not a no
[48:25] man's land that it doesn't belong to
[48:27] nobody. It belongs to God. Right? It is
[48:31] not just a empty vacant area where the
[48:34] enemy can come in the God comes in. It's
[48:36] just this tussle between two like
[48:38] between two you know trenches who you
[48:41] know who knows World War I right? They
[48:42] had no man's land. and the trenches. You
[48:44] know, there's there was movement of
[48:45] trenches, but it wasn't a very dynamic
[48:48] warfare. It was very static, very fixed
[48:50] position. But the middle where they
[48:51] would try and attack and get advantage
[48:53] and dislodge the enemy from their trench
[48:55] was called no man's land. Now, it was
[48:57] the mutual meeting ground. But I want to
[48:59] tell you, your mind is not a no man's
[49:01] land. It is God's land. Your human
[49:04] spirit belongs to God, right? It doesn't
[49:06] belong to the enemy. It's not some
[49:07] vacant place. No, it should be Emanuel's
[49:10] ground. It should be God's land,
[49:13] &gt;&gt; right? Our soul is the Lord's. Our body
[49:15] is the Lord's. We're a temple of the
[49:17] living God. And our spirit should be the
[49:19] Lord's also. So when he says it's it's
[49:21] it's a no like a mutual it is a mutual
[49:24] meeting ground, but it should be God's
[49:26] land.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Right? So let's let's just, you know,
[49:30] maybe in the past I've said it's
[49:31] literally no man's land, but it's not
[49:33] literally in no man's land. It's where
[49:35] the enemy meets you, but it's not his.
[49:37] It doesn't belong to him. Right? If it
[49:39] doesn't belong to him, then we have the
[49:41] right to drive him out. Now, it's very
[49:44] important when we look at the if the
[49:46] whole word hangs on these two these two
[49:50] commandments, I think we should pay
[49:51] attention because it's easy. You say,
[49:52] "Well, I love the Lord with all my soul,
[49:54] all that's within me." But what about
[49:56] our minds, right? Because this is where
[49:59] this is where faith and you know, this
[50:00] is where the enemy comes in. This is
[50:02] where the word has to be accepted in the
[50:04] mind first. Like faith starts with I
[50:06] choose to accept the word. That's where
[50:08] faith begins, right? And now even even
[50:12] the um Apostle Paul when he'd speak in
[50:14] Romans chapter 7 and you know he's he's
[50:16] dealing with the fact that we're two
[50:18] natures. You know when the Holy Ghost
[50:19] comes in you have a you have the inner
[50:21] man which is the spirit of God in you.
[50:23] Then you have your carnal nature which
[50:24] is always there. There's always a battle
[50:26] between the carnal nature and the
[50:28] spiritual man. Right? We always have
[50:30] this battle cuz we're in this body. But
[50:33] it doesn't mean that we aren't saved. It
[50:35] doesn't mean that we're going to stay
[50:37] defeated. It doesn't mean that we're
[50:38] never going to make it. No, we just live
[50:40] with this battle, right? But you got to
[50:42] realize with a battle, there's a victor.
[50:45] There's one winning and there's one
[50:46] losing. Like in the Ukraine at the
[50:48] moment, sometimes the Russians win,
[50:50] sometimes the Ukrainians win. But it's
[50:51] all about the amount of weapons are
[50:53] supplied to each side really dictates
[50:56] who's winning. Right now, how now we
[50:58] have a lot of weapons. We've got we've
[51:00] got the greatest weapon that's in
[51:02] existence is the word of God. Amen. So,
[51:04] so we want to we want to feed the inner
[51:06] man
[51:08] &gt;&gt; to to overcome or rather to subdue the
[51:10] flesh man, right? So, he says therefore,
[51:13] I delight in the law of God after the
[51:15] inward man. But I see another man in my
[51:18] members waring against the war of my
[51:19] mind and bringing me into captivity of
[51:21] the law of sin which is in my members.
[51:23] Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall
[51:25] deliver me from the from the body of
[51:27] this death? I thank God through Jesus
[51:29] Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I
[51:32] serve the law of God, but with the flesh
[51:35] um the law of sin. So he's saying with
[51:37] his mind, I I found this very
[51:39] interesting. He didn't say his heart. He
[51:40] said his mind. So his mental faculties
[51:42] is you know what's in his mind. He
[51:44] serves the law of God which is the Holy
[51:45] Ghost within you. Right? So it's
[51:47] important that we love the law with all
[51:48] our mind.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Okay? I trust you see there's an
[51:51] importance about this. It's not just you
[51:53] know I'm a Christian now and just you
[51:54] fill your mind up with all kind of
[51:56] garbage. No, you become a garbage can,
[51:58] right? And then the devil can you know
[52:00] you ever see like I remember the good
[52:01] old Gisbon city tip dump that was a real
[52:04] dump man it stunk sea girls everywhere
[52:06] was just a big chaos you know I went to
[52:08] this one not long ago here in silverream
[52:10] that was like 20 odd years ago I was
[52:12] there okay so I'm sure things have
[52:13] advanced but you know now it's all like
[52:16] what do you call it all hygienic you
[52:18] know you just kind of pull up to a thing
[52:20] and you dump your garbage and a rubbish
[52:22] I mean a bulldozer pushes it away and
[52:24] all these things but the Gisbon dump was
[52:25] a real dump I can guarantee you there
[52:27] were rats in that dump. There were mice
[52:30] in that dump. There were scavengers all
[52:31] over that dump. Why? Cuz it was a
[52:33] rubbish dump, right? But if you clean
[52:35] the thing up and you put in good things
[52:36] there, the rats would have to go. Or you
[52:38] put traps in. You'd get rid of the rats,
[52:41] &gt;&gt; right? You wouldn't put up with them
[52:42] there. You'd get rid of the seagulls,
[52:43] whatever. You would deal with them
[52:45] because you don't want them running
[52:47] around. Same thing with our mind, right?
[52:49] We don't want to be a garbage dump for
[52:51] the world. And unfortunately, a lot of
[52:52] things in this world are just trash. You
[52:55] know, I don't want to be social media's
[52:57] trash can. I don't want that stuff in my
[53:00] mind. I want No, I want with my whole
[53:02] mind to serve the Lord because I want to
[53:03] be effective for the kingdom of God.
[53:05] Like brother Isaac was saying, we all
[53:06] got a gift, right? And our gift is not
[53:08] trash can, right? We are the temples of
[53:12] the living God, right? So why let why
[53:14] let the enemy come in and fortify a
[53:17] position with a whole bunch of nonsense
[53:19] and let him bring in supplies, right?
[53:22] Why not dislodge that enemy by the word
[53:24] of God? Amen. Where it's no longer the
[53:27] enemy fighting within you in your mind.
[53:29] No, your mind. By your mind, you serve
[53:31] the law of God. You serve the word of
[53:33] God. Amen. Praise the Lord. I trust
[53:37] we're all happy today. Now, this mind,
[53:39] this word mind actually has a different
[53:42] um in the Bible, it's actually swapped
[53:44] for understanding.
[53:46] And and this is where it says in
[53:48] Ephesians having the understanding
[53:49] darkened being alienated from the life
[53:51] of God through the ignorance that is in
[53:52] them because of the blindness of their
[53:54] heart. So the word mind also swap for
[53:57] understanding. So if your mind is
[53:59] darkened you can't see correctly right?
[54:01] You know if people only see the negative
[54:03] that's all they see because their mind
[54:04] is full of negative. They cannot see a
[54:06] way out. But I tell you the word of God
[54:08] always brings a way out. Amen. Because
[54:10] remember we have the answer to every
[54:12] problem which is him which is the Lord
[54:14] Jesus Christ himself. You know, we're
[54:16] not ordained to sit here and worry about
[54:18] life. Worry has helped nobody. Faith is
[54:22] delivered always. Amen. So why worry
[54:24] when you can believe? Why worry? And
[54:27] because it's amazing how man, maybe it's
[54:28] just me, we're built to think negative
[54:30] naturally. You know, man, and maybe it's
[54:33] because of the news and trouble and all
[54:35] the things going on. It gives us a
[54:37] certain way to look negative, right? A
[54:39] lot of the news is always negative. I
[54:41] think Brother Brammy would speak about
[54:42] it. There was a husband and wife.
[54:44] They're sitting there and he's reading
[54:45] the newspaper and she says, "Honey,
[54:47] what's going on in um in the news?" And
[54:48] he just said, "Um, different people,
[54:51] same stuff, you know, it's just a cycle.
[54:53] This person does this. Well, a person 10
[54:56] years ago did the same thing. And this
[54:57] person did this, well, it's cuz someone
[54:59] else did it before." It's just this same
[55:01] cycle of news always comes around and
[55:03] it's always hyped up to get your
[55:04] attention and, you know, is trying to
[55:06] read Christian headlines, you know, from
[55:08] stuff or whatever it was. And it's
[55:10] never, you know, like the headline
[55:12] nowadays is never a fact. Like this
[55:15] person did this. It's always a clickbait
[55:19] kind of effect because it wants you to
[55:20] open that web page to see. So she can't
[55:22] even just look at the headlines anymore
[55:24] and just read, oh, that's the news. It's
[55:25] trying to grab you. And how it grabs you
[55:27] is it wants to get your attention. It
[55:28] always um what do you call it? Um it's
[55:31] what hyperbole
[55:33] or whatever you call it. You know, it's
[55:34] hyped up. It's always greater than what
[55:36] it really is.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing. So if it's
[55:39] really bad, the news will say it's
[55:40] really, really, really bad. And so what
[55:42] does that do? That conditions our mind
[55:44] to be negative, right? But we should not
[55:46] be negative in any part of our lives. We
[55:48] should be positive because the Lord
[55:50] Jesus has us in his hands. Amen. We are
[55:52] his children. He can't lose any one of
[55:54] us. Amen. We are his attributes. And
[55:56] there's one thing he cannot do is leave
[55:58] a part of himself behind. No, he's
[56:00] collecting all of himself from this
[56:02] earth and taking us into the rapture. So
[56:04] we cannot ever never let a negative
[56:06] mindset grip you. You say, "Well, my
[56:09] last name should be called negative."
[56:11] No, we're called the bride of Jesus
[56:12] Christ. Amen. Our last name is Jesus
[56:14] Christ, right? So we should not have a
[56:16] negative attitude. We should always have
[56:18] a positive attitude. Well, the glass is
[56:20] always half empty. Look at it a
[56:22] different angle.
[56:24] It takes the Lord to make you look at
[56:27] things differently. There's a tour on
[56:28] the way to Emmas. So maybe we just go I
[56:31] just we're just going to walk around it,
[56:32] but we'll see how we go. says the two on
[56:34] the way to Emmas they were they had seen
[56:36] the crucifixion they had seen the Lord
[56:38] buried they had seen everything being
[56:40] done but yet because they couldn't grasp
[56:43] what was going on what had happened they
[56:45] were broken sad upset people but rightly
[56:48] so their Messiah had been crucified but
[56:50] they did not understand the greatest
[56:52] thing that was happening in the history
[56:54] of man they were actually living in they
[56:57] saw him physically go to Calvary if they
[56:59] knew what he was doing it would not have
[57:00] been a weeping it would have been a
[57:02] rejoicing it would have been a
[57:03] thanksgiving parade. It would have been
[57:05] such a jubilee time to realize this is
[57:07] the lamb of God and he is taking away
[57:10] the sins of the world. And not just the
[57:11] sins of the world, he's taking away my
[57:13] sin. Amen. He's dying as a sinner in my
[57:15] place that I don't need to go to hell.
[57:17] He is making an atonement for me. A
[57:19] perfect one. Amen. That I don't need to
[57:21] worry if I'm going to make it. No,
[57:23] because he makes it. I make it.
[57:25] Hallelujah. Amen. So then, but you see,
[57:27] they did not understand what was going
[57:29] on. So it was negative. They thought the
[57:31] enem is winning here. This is a
[57:33] disaster. The our whole world has fallen
[57:35] apart. No, the world had not fallen
[57:38] apart. It was going exactly how God
[57:41] wanted it to be.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; You see, and then so they're walking on
[57:44] the way to Emmas. They're down. They're
[57:46] they're they're broken and Jesus. But
[57:48] the thing is, they're talking about the
[57:50] Lord.
[57:51] You know what we can do? You can have
[57:54] God visit your house. You can have him
[57:57] open your door, walk through the front
[57:59] door, touch your life.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; We can have that.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; We can have that. It's not a pie in the
[58:06] sky thing or a well, when the prophet
[58:07] was here kind of thing. No, the same God
[58:09] that visited neighborhoods back there in
[58:11] in in the 50s and 60s and confirmed the
[58:14] faith of people is the same God. This is
[58:16] actually the crux of my service, so
[58:17] maybe we'll just go home after this
[58:19] statement. But you see, the same God
[58:20] that was back there and visited
[58:22] neighborhoods and touched the people's
[58:23] lives and all these things is the very
[58:26] same God that does the same things
[58:28] today. Remember, he is Jesus Christ the
[58:31] &gt;&gt; same yesterday, today, and forever. He's
[58:33] not Jesus Christ not as much as he was
[58:35] yesterday. He's the same yesterday,
[58:38] today, and forever. What was really
[58:39] brother's battlecry? Jesus Christ the
[58:42] same. Everything he was back then, he is
[58:44] today, and he he shall be forever. So,
[58:46] he does not change. The one great
[58:48] constant in this life is he is the same.
[58:51] His word is the same. His power is the
[58:53] same. His ability is the same.
[58:55] Everything he can do is exactly the same
[58:57] today as he was back then. And he
[58:59] purchased your healing, your salvation,
[59:01] your deliverance back then. And now he's
[59:02] here to manifest it in our lives. Amen.
[59:05] So he can walk in your door. He can open
[59:07] your door. He Imagine that. I was
[59:09] thinking about me and Christie were
[59:10] having a rejoice over this. I just
[59:12] talked to her about it. Imagine Jesus
[59:13] walking into your house.
[59:16] Oh, that's just an imagination. No, it's
[59:18] the mind.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; What are you thinking on? What are you
[59:21] thinking on the possibilities of what he
[59:23] can do? You see? So, there they are.
[59:25] They're walking along. They're down.
[59:27] They're downcast, but they're talking
[59:28] about him. And what that that caused him
[59:31] to join their conversation. They weren't
[59:33] talking about the stock market or the
[59:34] economics or the things. They were
[59:36] talking about the main thing. Lord, what
[59:39] are you doing in our day? I don't
[59:42] understand. And they were talking back
[59:43] and forth, sad, but their minds were on
[59:46] him.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; We had seen him do many things. We're in
[59:49] the boat with him. We saw him feed the
[59:51] multitudes and raise Lazarus and the
[59:53] woman at the well and changing her and
[59:55] raising the dead woman's son and all
[59:57] these things. But what is he doing now?
[59:59] I don't understand it. But that was what
[1:00:01] because that had consumed their mind.
[1:00:03] It's a good thing to be consumed about.
[1:00:06] And that caused him to draw near. And
[1:00:08] then he begins to walk along like he
[1:00:09] doesn't know. And he begins to talk to
[1:00:12] them and they're surprised. What do you
[1:00:13] mean you don't know what's going on? And
[1:00:15] how how on earth can you not under? This
[1:00:16] is trending news, man. It's not on the
[1:00:19] other side of the world. It's happening.
[1:00:20] It happened just a few days ago. How
[1:00:22] could you not hear the crowd? And were
[1:00:23] you not caught up in the hosanas of when
[1:00:25] he came into the city the week before
[1:00:27] and how did you not see all these things
[1:00:28] and be part of it? He was the main
[1:00:30] thing.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; He was part of it. Amen. And he knew the
[1:00:34] scripture. He was fulfilling. But yet he
[1:00:36] would pretend that he didn't know. But
[1:00:37] thing is he be to he be to walk with
[1:00:40] them and open the scripture to them. And
[1:00:42] then finally when they came to the came
[1:00:44] to the you know village on the you know
[1:00:46] you know when they came to Emmas he was
[1:00:48] looking like he was going to walk on.
[1:00:49] They said no come stay the night with
[1:00:51] us. The day is gone. And you know they
[1:00:52] sat him down at the head of the table.
[1:00:54] He broke the bread and I tell you what
[1:00:57] their eyes came open. Their mind
[1:00:59] changed. Their mind changed from from
[1:01:01] from sadness and and and depression and
[1:01:04] anxiety and stress and worry and
[1:01:06] questions to joy and thanksgiving and a
[1:01:10] thrill of excitement. We've seen him.
[1:01:12] He's alive. Amen. We've seen him. He's
[1:01:14] not dead anymore. The one walking with
[1:01:16] us, opening the scripture, walked with
[1:01:18] us until finally we saw him to who he
[1:01:20] really was. And they he did that until
[1:01:22] they caught it. They were part of the
[1:01:24] resurrection. That changed their whole
[1:01:26] thinking. that changed their whole life
[1:01:28] because when they went back to
[1:01:29] Jerusalem, they didn't walk the same way
[1:01:31] when they walking to Emmas down and
[1:01:33] maybe dragging their feet in the dust
[1:01:34] and looking down and no, they were
[1:01:36] running
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; because they had purpose now. Amen. And
[1:01:40] and it wasn't a question they running
[1:01:41] with. They had an answer. We've seen
[1:01:43] him. Amen. We've seen him alive. He
[1:01:46] broke the bread. He did something he did
[1:01:47] before he died. Amen. He did the same
[1:01:49] manifestation. I tell you what, friend,
[1:01:51] the same resurrected one. Amen. that you
[1:01:53] read about in the scripture is the same
[1:01:55] one that discerned the thoughts and
[1:01:56] tents of the heart back there in the
[1:01:58] scripture is the same one in this day.
[1:02:00] And he's still the same God today. Amen.
[1:02:02] That we can see we have seen Messiah in
[1:02:04] this day. His word has come open. He's
[1:02:06] revealed himself. He's made himself
[1:02:08] personal to me. Now my thinking has
[1:02:10] changed because why? I have the
[1:02:12] solution. I mean I have the answer to
[1:02:14] the devil's question. I don't need to
[1:02:16] worry no more because he has revealed
[1:02:18] himself to me. Not for me to become a
[1:02:20] religious argumentative type, but for me
[1:02:22] to realize I'm part of the prophecy of
[1:02:24] the resurrection in this day.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It changed their thinking.
[1:02:29] Can we not have the same I believe I'm
[1:02:32] those two on the way to I believe I'm
[1:02:35] talking to those two because brother
[1:02:37] Brand preached two sermons. He said
[1:02:38] modern events made clear by prophecy.
[1:02:41] And he goes to Luke chapter 24. So what
[1:02:43] is he saying? He's saying Luke 24 is
[1:02:45] prophecy. So, there has to be a
[1:02:47] fulfillment of the prophecy. And he's
[1:02:49] saying, "You are the fulfillment of the
[1:02:51] prophecy."
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because we're living in a
[1:02:56] resurrection season. The son of man's
[1:02:58] revealed himself. The sign of the
[1:02:59] Messiah is done. And what? God is alive
[1:03:01] and well in 2025.
[1:03:04] Amen. It changed their whole thinking.
[1:03:06] So, don't be don't don't
[1:03:08] be caught up in the negative or the
[1:03:11] what's the point and the why am I even
[1:03:13] here and this is lame and this. No.
[1:03:15] Change your let God change your
[1:03:16] thinking.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:21] Praise the Lord. You see, it's like this
[1:03:24] here.
[1:03:26] Jesus is asleep on the boat.
[1:03:29] They're caught in the storm. The
[1:03:31] disciples are doing everything they can
[1:03:32] to keep the boat going cuz they're
[1:03:34] sailors. They know how to deal with that
[1:03:36] boat. They know how to deal with the
[1:03:37] conditions. But the thing is, their
[1:03:40] thinking, they don't realize who's in
[1:03:43] the boat with them. Their thinking
[1:03:45] hasn't come open. Cuz really, if you
[1:03:47] think about it, if you knew you had
[1:03:48] Messiah with you, the one who made the
[1:03:50] Sea of Galilee and made the wind and
[1:03:51] made everything, wouldn't you wake him
[1:03:53] up first?
[1:03:55] Why would you try with your human effort
[1:03:57] to try and control the situation when
[1:03:59] you realize the very one who made sun,
[1:04:03] sea, and skies, and you know, everything
[1:04:05] is in the boat with you. But you see
[1:04:07] their thinking their thinking had not
[1:04:09] been changed yet for them to realize who
[1:04:11] was really there because finally when
[1:04:13] they woke him up they were so they
[1:04:15] marveled. I said what manner of man is
[1:04:17] this that even the winds and the sea
[1:04:19] obey him. So they were they were so
[1:04:21] shocked. What kind of guy is this that's
[1:04:23] even in our boat? They didn't, you know,
[1:04:24] it didn't enter into their mind the
[1:04:26] ability and the and the power, the
[1:04:29] absolute power and ability of the one in
[1:04:31] their boat. Because if they really knew
[1:04:33] that, they would have woken them up
[1:04:35] before, you know, because they thought
[1:04:37] they're going to die and they're going
[1:04:38] to drown all these things cuz they did
[1:04:40] not realize the one that's asleep in
[1:04:43] their boat. Friends,
[1:04:46] your body is a boat.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; I trust Jesus is in your boat,
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; right? The one that's within you. Look,
[1:04:53] they were they they could not fathom who
[1:04:56] he was, the power that he had, right?
[1:04:58] But we can look back now and we can see
[1:05:00] his power and ability. Amen. We can see,
[1:05:02] yeah, he is the resurrection and the
[1:05:04] life. He is the deliverer. There's no
[1:05:07] case too hard for the Lord. Amen. He can
[1:05:09] create cells where there's dead cells.
[1:05:11] He can bring bring harmony back where
[1:05:13] there's chaos. He can take a wayward
[1:05:15] mind, a wayward spirit, and bring it
[1:05:16] back to someone. Amen. There's no case
[1:05:18] too hard from there's nothing impossible
[1:05:20] with our God. Amen. We can look back
[1:05:22] 2,000 years of testimony of God rising
[1:05:25] on the scene, stepping out of history.
[1:05:27] Amen. And when you begin to think about
[1:05:28] him, it caus him to step out of history
[1:05:30] into your situation. Amen. Our God is
[1:05:33] almighty, all powerful. He's a God of
[1:05:35] many chances. Amen. He's not some weak
[1:05:37] God. No, he is the resurrection and the
[1:05:39] life. He is Messiah. And this message is
[1:05:42] Messiah. It is Jesus Christ revealed.
[1:05:44] Amen. So we realize now if he's in our
[1:05:46] boat, we can wake him up. Hallelujah.
[1:05:49] Amen. We don't need to think negative
[1:05:51] and look at conditions of life and this
[1:05:53] storm and this trouble and this wind and
[1:05:55] this is out of my control and I tried to
[1:05:57] manage this but it's just totally out of
[1:05:59] my control. No, you can wake up Jesus.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; You can wake up Messiah. Amen. And what
[1:06:04] does he do? He just says a couple of
[1:06:05] words. Peace. Be still.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all those 10,000 devils swore
[1:06:09] they drown on that day. Amen. What
[1:06:11] happened? His those words drove the
[1:06:14] devils out of the wind and the waves. A
[1:06:16] I was like telling William the other
[1:06:17] night, you know what the word of God
[1:06:18] does? It grabs the devil and throws him
[1:06:20] out. Amen. Be like brother Ed and
[1:06:22] brother Kaben grabbing someone and
[1:06:24] throwing them out of the church. That's
[1:06:25] what the word does. Amen. The devil
[1:06:27] doesn't want to leave, but he has to
[1:06:28] leave. He gets manhandled by the by, you
[1:06:31] know, by God. He gets put in a headlock
[1:06:32] and thrown out the door. That's what the
[1:06:34] word does. Amen. That's what that's what
[1:06:36] his power does. Doesn't matter how many
[1:06:38] of them there are. There was legion.
[1:06:40] There was a lot in in that guy. The word
[1:06:42] threw him out. Threw them all out. Every
[1:06:44] single one.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's the same God
[1:06:47] today.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's all powerful. Amen. We know
[1:06:51] who's in our boat.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know who's in our boat. We've
[1:06:54] seen him do many mighty things. Amen.
[1:06:57] And I believe it's time to wake him up.
[1:06:59] I'm not saying he's asleep in your boat,
[1:07:01] but I encourage you. Wake him up like
[1:07:03] never before.
[1:07:05] Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There's an old slogan.
[1:07:10] I want you to remember it. Do right.
[1:07:12] That's your duty to God. Think right.
[1:07:15] That's your duty to yourself and you're
[1:07:17] bound to be right.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; So it's your duty to yourself to think
[1:07:21] right.
[1:07:23] What value do you put upon yourself?
[1:07:27] You ain't a trash can. You ain't you
[1:07:30] ain't something that's useless and no
[1:07:32] hopeer and there's no value in you.
[1:07:34] Don't think like that. Your soul is
[1:07:36] worth more than 10,000 worlds. You know
[1:07:39] the value of this earth. They don't know
[1:07:41] how valuable this earth is, the natural
[1:07:43] earth. cuz we do not know the minerals
[1:07:46] and the precious metals and all those
[1:07:48] things that are actually in under the
[1:07:51] crust like deep down. We don't know how
[1:07:54] silver comes out and gold and things is
[1:07:56] because you know volcanoes come, lava
[1:07:58] comes right deep within the earth. But
[1:08:00] they can't actually say the earth is
[1:08:01] worth x amount of dollars.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; They don't know.
[1:08:06] And brother Bram says you're worth 10
[1:08:08] thousands of those they don't knows.
[1:08:11] That's how valuable the you are.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you're not some no value
[1:08:16] useless thing. No, you're worth more
[1:08:18] than 10,000 worlds.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; You can't even put a dollar sign to you.
[1:08:22] That's how valuable you are. So, you
[1:08:25] want to think right cuz it's your duty
[1:08:27] to yourself. You're you are worth more
[1:08:29] than a bunch of nonsense Tik Tok videos
[1:08:31] going through your spirit all the time.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; You're worth far more than that. you're
[1:08:36] far you're worth far more than some
[1:08:38] political debate ruling your life all
[1:08:40] the time or some kind of you know oh my
[1:08:43] self-esteem's low and all these things.
[1:08:45] No, if you know who you are in God, your
[1:08:47] self-esteem will go through the roof cuz
[1:08:49] you realize your value. Amen. And God is
[1:08:51] here today, I believe, to tell you
[1:08:52] you're the most valuable thing in
[1:08:55] existence. And I don't even want to use
[1:08:56] the word thing when I'm talking about
[1:08:58] you because you're not a thing. You're
[1:08:59] not an object. You're a person. I mean,
[1:09:01] you're the beloved of the Lord.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we don't never want to diminish
[1:09:05] our thinking just down to what the world
[1:09:07] wants to put in us. No, let the word of
[1:09:10] God rule in your life.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's your duty to yourself to
[1:09:14] think right. Amen. So don't think
[1:09:17] negative.
[1:09:19] Don't think, well, can it really happen.
[1:09:21] Don't be doubleminded. No. Make up your
[1:09:23] mind. The word of God is true and God is
[1:09:26] more than able to fulfill it and I'm one
[1:09:28] of his children and everything's working
[1:09:31] for my good. Amen. who's with me this
[1:09:33] morning. Amen. I'm never out of his
[1:09:35] care. I'm under the shadow of his great
[1:09:37] wing. Amen. I'm surrounded by eagle
[1:09:40] feathers of great Jehovah. Amen. I'm not
[1:09:42] alone in this world. I'm not cast out
[1:09:44] somewhere in the dark. No, I've been
[1:09:46] brought into the light. I mean, I've
[1:09:48] been brought into the haven of rest.
[1:09:49] Amen. And I'm safe and secure. No matter
[1:09:52] what tries to come my way, I'm safe in
[1:09:54] Almighty God's arms.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:03] See, he says this here. We'll come to
[1:10:05] this. He says, you know, it's like it
[1:10:07] says in James, and we love to quote
[1:10:08] this, "Draw nigh to God, he'll draw nigh
[1:10:11] to you."
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Well, how do you do that? Well, I sit on
[1:10:14] the front row. Is that drawing nigh to
[1:10:16] God? Or my Bible's closer to me. Or I
[1:10:20] have the message louder. Or, you know,
[1:10:22] what does that mean? You think about it.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; You start thinking on him and his
[1:10:26] goodness. That starts drawing closer to
[1:10:29] God. God, I love you. You're my
[1:10:32] everything. This may be very simple
[1:10:34] today, but I think these things God is
[1:10:36] in simplicity.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; You know, the message has to become into
[1:10:39] a practical outworking, not an academic
[1:10:41] understanding. We want to have victory
[1:10:43] in everyday life. Maybe I just preached
[1:10:44] to myself today. Okay? But you know, you
[1:10:48] think on him
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; and not he's not some distant god. He's
[1:10:53] not an uncaring hunk of stone somewhere
[1:10:56] in some old temple somewhere and that's
[1:10:59] him. No, he's a living God. The Apostle
[1:11:01] Paul says he's not far from any one of
[1:11:03] us. He's closer than your next breath.
[1:11:07] Amen. The word says, "Where two or three
[1:11:08] are gathered in my name, there I am in
[1:11:09] the midst." So you just look at your
[1:11:11] neighbor and realize God's between you
[1:11:13] and your neighbor. Look at your
[1:11:14] neighbor. God's between you and your
[1:11:16] neighbor.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; That's how close he is. Oh, he's up in
[1:11:19] the heavens somewhere. No, he's not. No,
[1:11:21] deity is in you.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; He's in heaven, but he's also in you.
[1:11:24] So, he's not some far away place. And
[1:11:26] you know, because our mind, the devil,
[1:11:27] wants us to think that God doesn't care.
[1:11:29] He doesn't understand. He doesn't hear
[1:11:31] our prayers. No, his blood puts us on
[1:11:33] speaking terms with him.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; It puts us in that condition. You say,
[1:11:38] "Well, no, there's no way God could ever
[1:11:39] visit my house. You know, I was thinking
[1:11:41] about that. And if you look at look at
[1:11:43] the ones in the Old Testament that the
[1:11:45] Lord appeared to, Moses was a runaway
[1:11:47] prophet backsliden on the back side of
[1:11:49] the desert. Forgot his commission. tried
[1:11:51] to hide just to live out his life and
[1:11:53] die being a shepherd in Midian and the
[1:11:56] Lord appeared to him. Look at Gideon
[1:11:58] threshing weed in secret, hiding,
[1:12:00] fearful of the enemy and the Lord
[1:12:02] appeared to him. A mean look at Samson's
[1:12:05] parents just doing their thing and the
[1:12:06] Lord appeared to them. Amen. So, so what
[1:12:08] about you? Look at the Apostle Paul.
[1:12:11] What was his mission? Going to Damascus.
[1:12:13] I'm going to wipe out this cult. I'm
[1:12:15] going to wipe out this sect of Jesus of
[1:12:17] Nazarene and I'm going to get rid of
[1:12:19] this thing. That was his heart. His mind
[1:12:21] was consumed by that and the Lord
[1:12:23] appeared to him.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; So why do we think that God cannot visit
[1:12:26] our house and visit us and change our
[1:12:28] lives?
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Are we in that condition? I'm just using
[1:12:31] those to show you can be in any
[1:12:32] condition you want. Legion was the way
[1:12:34] he was and the Lord came to him. Amen.
[1:12:37] Dus's daughter was dead and the Lord
[1:12:38] came to him. Lazarus was dead in the
[1:12:40] tomb and the Lord came to him.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; I think that fits kind of everyone here,
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; right? So there's no one outside of the
[1:12:47] bracket where God cannot come and step
[1:12:50] in and reveal himself and speak and
[1:12:52] change our lives. No, he can do it.
[1:12:55] Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:59] See, he says this here.
[1:13:02] He says, "Wherefore be not unwise, but
[1:13:05] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:13:06] is, and be not drunk with wine, wherein
[1:13:08] is excess, but be filled with the
[1:13:10] spirit. Be filled. Be overflowing.
[1:13:15] Get intoxicated.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; We don't just have a sociable drink
[1:13:18] around here. We get drunk
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; in the spirit. Speaking to yourselves in
[1:13:23] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[1:13:25] singing and making melody in your heart
[1:13:28] to the Lord. So start singing a happy
[1:13:31] song
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; in your heart. You say, "Well, I'm not
[1:13:34] used to doing that." Retrain your mind.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; It's your duty to yourself. Oh, but I'm
[1:13:40] always thinking negative and what I
[1:13:41] can't, you know, the failure I am as a
[1:13:44] Christian. and all these things. Stop
[1:13:45] that.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Stop thinking negative about you. You're
[1:13:50] an overcomer.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; You've been built to overcome. You're a
[1:13:52] champion. Amen. You're God's heroes in
[1:13:55] this end time. You're a hero of faith.
[1:13:57] Amen. You're are God's victory.
[1:14:00] We're not useless. We're not hopeless.
[1:14:02] We're not no hopers. We're not just
[1:14:03] benchwarmers or orange boys or water
[1:14:06] boys. No, we're on the field.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is who we are. We are made to
[1:14:11] overcome. Amen. When the Lord wrote
[1:14:13] about this age, and to him that
[1:14:14] overcomemeth will will sit down on my
[1:14:16] throne as I overcame and sat down on my
[1:14:19] father's throne, who was he thinking
[1:14:20] about when he wrote that?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; He had specific people in mind. He
[1:14:25] didn't just have a he, you know, it
[1:14:26] wasn't just some empty invitation that
[1:14:28] he just threw out there and he's
[1:14:29] wondering who's going to RSVP and say,
[1:14:31] "Here I am." He knew exactly who was
[1:14:33] going to overcome. He's not surprised
[1:14:35] that you're an overcomer. He's not
[1:14:36] surprised that you want to serve him.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; So why do we beat ourselves up about it?
[1:14:40] It's the enemy trying to make us think
[1:14:43] negative about ourselves. And quite
[1:14:45] frankly, we got to get our mind off
[1:14:47] ourselves and get our mind on our lamb.
[1:14:49] Amen. Because he overcame hell, death,
[1:14:51] and the grave. He conquered all things.
[1:14:53] He's the one who fulfills his word. He's
[1:14:55] the high priest over his own word to
[1:14:57] fulfill it. So why think about you?
[1:14:59] Change your thinking to think about him.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Are we all together this morning?
[1:15:07] I tell you what I found in my own little
[1:15:09] experience when I go to thinking on the
[1:15:11] Lord, I never stay sad.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; There's a joy comes in. There's a peace
[1:15:16] cuz you be because you begin to realize
[1:15:19] he was examined and found blameless. He
[1:15:22] was offered and he was accepted. Amen.
[1:15:25] He's now on the right hand, the majesty
[1:15:27] on high interceding over his own word.
[1:15:29] He's the one who found me. He's the one
[1:15:31] who saved me. He's the one. You want a
[1:15:33] joy in your step? Think about what he's
[1:15:34] done for you.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Think about where you came from. You
[1:15:37] say, "Well, I was raised in the message,
[1:15:38] but why do you want to serve him?" God
[1:15:40] put that in you.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we should just You just
[1:15:44] It'll It'll make you happy.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; It'll make you very happy.
[1:15:50] That's why it says speaking to
[1:15:51] yourselves in psalms, hymns. I'm just
[1:15:52] repeating this because I think we need
[1:15:54] to Let's make this a daily habit. What's
[1:15:56] going on in your head? Victory is mine.
[1:15:59] Victory is mine. Amen.
[1:16:02] I've got joy unspeakable and full of I'm
[1:16:05] not going to keep singing. I don't want
[1:16:06] to scare you. But but you see that
[1:16:08] should be not my voice in your head, but
[1:16:10] a nice one. Your one, right? But
[1:16:12] shouldn't that be it? You say, "I don't
[1:16:14] feel it. Think it."
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; It's your duty to yourself.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:22] That's what we should do.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Now, we'll go here. I'm just I'm I'm
[1:16:26] just going to let's just do this for a
[1:16:28] second now because because some people
[1:16:32] think, well, if God really dwells in me,
[1:16:34] I'll never have a negative bad thought
[1:16:36] in my days.
[1:16:38] That ain't the case.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Okay? But you can deal with the
[1:16:42] thoughts.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; It's like there and you know, I'll just
[1:16:45] go back to this picture. You know, it's
[1:16:47] like just say we're in that trench on
[1:16:49] the that trench system in the right hand
[1:16:50] side. The enem is advancing. You know,
[1:16:52] what do we do? Do we just watch them
[1:16:55] come and watch them throw bombs and
[1:16:57] machine gun us and No, you start
[1:16:59] shooting. You shoot before they shoot,
[1:17:02] right? You deal with them as they're
[1:17:03] advancing towards you, right? Just
[1:17:05] because they're attacking you doesn't
[1:17:07] mean you've you're defeated. Doesn't
[1:17:09] mean they own your trench. No, it's your
[1:17:10] it's your mind, right? It's your spirit
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; and you place it in the Lord's hands,
[1:17:15] right? So let's just well let's just
[1:17:18] find this here cuz
[1:17:20] so there's always that thing well if I
[1:17:22] you know if I have a negative thought
[1:17:24] then how can I have victory and all
[1:17:26] these things no it's what you do with
[1:17:28] that negative thought it's what you do
[1:17:30] see if any see if any thought comes by
[1:17:32] well maybe uh it couldn't be so maybe
[1:17:35] get your mind off it right quick so the
[1:17:37] doubt comes into your mind well I don't
[1:17:39] know is this really true can he really
[1:17:41] help me no get that out of your thinking
[1:17:44] completely think on things that's
[1:17:46] positive.
[1:17:48] Never let a negative thought pass
[1:17:49] through or don't let it stop anyhow if
[1:17:52] it starts through. Just keep your
[1:17:54] thoughts positive. Jesus, don't think
[1:17:56] sitting here in a wheelchair you that
[1:17:58] you're hopeless, helpless. You're not.
[1:18:00] Don't let that negative thought ever
[1:18:02] pass through or don't let it anchor. You
[1:18:05] can't help it going through your mind.
[1:18:06] That's right. But don't let it stop.
[1:18:08] Like the old farmer said, "I can't keep
[1:18:10] the birds from flying over my place."
[1:18:12] But he had a double barrel shotgun said,
[1:18:14] "I am sure can keep them from roosting."
[1:18:16] Amen. So you do the same thing and you
[1:18:18] and you too see. Don't let them roost.
[1:18:21] Let them pass right on through there.
[1:18:22] Now there's a shotgun to use both new
[1:18:25] and old testament. It's a double barrel.
[1:18:26] It's very good, too. I'll tell you,
[1:18:28] it'll keep them all away. Amen. So
[1:18:31] whenever a negative thought comes in,
[1:18:33] no, you combat it with a positive
[1:18:34] thought.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] You say, well, the thought comes in, I
[1:18:41] don't, you know, my sins are all around
[1:18:42] me. I can never be free. And you know,
[1:18:44] you think, no, as far as east is from
[1:18:46] the west, so far, so far hath he removed
[1:18:49] our transgressions from us.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, God isn't the same today. And
[1:18:53] I wish he had moved like he did back in
[1:18:55] the few years ago. Jesus Christ the same
[1:18:58] yesterday, today, and forever. I'm
[1:19:00] giving you some shotgun shells. Put them
[1:19:01] up and get a beat on that bird and shoot
[1:19:03] it out of the sky. Amen. You know am I
[1:19:09] even as David also describeth the
[1:19:11] blessedness of the man but unto whom God
[1:19:13] imputeth righteousness without works
[1:19:15] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[1:19:17] are forgiven and whose sins are covered.
[1:19:19] Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[1:19:21] not impute sin. So am I doing enough?
[1:19:23] Are my works really manifesting my
[1:19:25] faith? Well, you are God has imputed
[1:19:28] righteousness to you without works
[1:19:30] because of your faith.
[1:19:32] We're shooting out roosters and
[1:19:35] buzzards. the trust.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Will yo, will the Lord pardon me?
[1:19:39] Will let the wicked forsake his way and
[1:19:41] the unrighteous man his thoughts and let
[1:19:44] him return unto the Lord and we he will
[1:19:46] have mercy upon him and to our God for
[1:19:48] he will abundantly pardon. Amen. I like
[1:19:51] that. He'll abundantly pardon. Notice a
[1:19:53] little bit pardon. I'm going to
[1:19:54] abundantly pardon.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The steps of a good man are
[1:19:58] ordered by the Lord and he delightth in
[1:20:00] his way. Am I really walking the Lord's
[1:20:02] perfect will? You got to trust your
[1:20:03] steps are ordered,
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; right? You got to trust that your steps
[1:20:06] are ordered. Well, if God was ordering
[1:20:08] my steps, you would never have a bad day
[1:20:10] or any trouble. Israel's steps were
[1:20:12] ordered by the Lord coming out of Egypt.
[1:20:14] They went to, you know, remember they
[1:20:16] crossed the Red Sea. They had a Jubilee
[1:20:18] meeting right there. Where did the Lord
[1:20:19] lead them? Three days in the desert
[1:20:21] without any water. And the water they
[1:20:23] came to was the place they called Mara.
[1:20:26] It was bitter water. They started to
[1:20:28] drink. Maybe the elation would have, you
[1:20:30] know, rushed through them when they saw
[1:20:31] water. They would have been running to
[1:20:32] the water hole or wherever it was. And
[1:20:34] then they grab that water they put in
[1:20:35] their mouth and they spit it out because
[1:20:36] it's bitter and they begin to question
[1:20:38] why has the Lord brought us to a bitter
[1:20:40] experience. Their footsteps were ordered
[1:20:43] there and the Lord inspired Moses to
[1:20:46] take a tree and cut it down and put it
[1:20:47] in the water. It became sweet. Amen. And
[1:20:50] that tree that you that that he cut down
[1:20:52] was the cross. And when you add the
[1:20:54] cross to a bitter experience, it becomes
[1:20:56] sweet.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So their footsteps were ordered
[1:21:00] into a bitter experience. But it did not
[1:21:02] stay bitter because they mixed the right
[1:21:04] ingredient which was Calvary.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you know some who doubt am I
[1:21:09] really you know if things are if I'm
[1:21:11] walking in the ways of the Lord why is
[1:21:12] it tough and hard? Well they had a bit
[1:21:14] of time God led them there. Trust the
[1:21:17] Lord's leading you. Amen. Though he fall
[1:21:19] he shall not be utterly cast down. The
[1:21:21] Lord upholdeth him with his hand. I've
[1:21:24] fallen again. How can I ever get up?
[1:21:26] Blast that thing out. No. The Lord
[1:21:27] upholds you in his hand.
[1:21:30] How am I ever going to provide? There's
[1:21:31] always those questions and doubts,
[1:21:33] especially in this kind of a climate
[1:21:34] that we're in. Well, David would say,
[1:21:36] I've been young and I'm old, yet I have
[1:21:38] not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his
[1:21:40] seed begging bread. Amen. That was that
[1:21:43] was David's experience and that is our
[1:21:46] experience. So, you take your shotgun of
[1:21:48] that scripture, you blast the enemy out
[1:21:50] when he brings doubts and questions how
[1:21:52] you're going to be for the future. No,
[1:21:53] the Lord will provide. He is Jehovah
[1:21:56] Gyra in every part of our lives.
[1:21:58] Hallelujah.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is um Psalm 121. I just
[1:22:05] enjoyed these so I thought I'd share
[1:22:06] them with you. Okay. We're just going to
[1:22:07] read some scripture for a bit. Not too
[1:22:09] long though. So it says a song of
[1:22:11] degrees. Now that the word degrees
[1:22:13] actually actually means elevation.
[1:22:14] Actually means ascension. Amen. So so
[1:22:18] when you begin to think about this here,
[1:22:20] he says I'll lift up my eyes from the
[1:22:21] hills from whence cometh my help. My
[1:22:23] help cometh from the Lord which made
[1:22:25] heaven and earth. Amen. He'll not suffer
[1:22:28] thy foot to be moved. He that keepeth
[1:22:30] thee will not slumber. Behold, he that
[1:22:32] keepeth Israel shall neither s slumber
[1:22:34] nor sleep. The Lord is my keeper. The
[1:22:37] Lord is my shade upon thy right hand.
[1:22:39] The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor
[1:22:41] the moon by night. The Lord shall
[1:22:43] preserve thee from all evil. Are you
[1:22:44] ascending? As you read this, do you feel
[1:22:46] lifted up? When do you realize the
[1:22:48] Lord's my keeper?
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my strength. My help cometh
[1:22:52] from the Lord. Almighty God is my help.
[1:22:55] Amen. He's my strength. He made heaven
[1:22:57] and earth. Does it not lift up your
[1:22:58] spirits a bit when you begin to realize
[1:23:00] if God be before me, who can be against
[1:23:02] me?
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; He shall preserve thee from all evil. He
[1:23:05] shall preserve thy soul. The Lord shall
[1:23:08] preserve thy going out, thy coming in
[1:23:10] from this time forth and even for ever
[1:23:12] more.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're in the middle of a trial.
[1:23:15] You think there's no way you can get out
[1:23:16] of it. You take this shell. It's a good
[1:23:18] one. No weapon that's formed against
[1:23:20] thee shall prosper. Amen. And every
[1:23:22] tongue that shall rise against thee in
[1:23:23] judgment thou shalt condemn. What is
[1:23:25] that tongue that rise up against you?
[1:23:26] That's the tongue of the enemy trying to
[1:23:28] make you think you've gone too far.
[1:23:29] You've crossed the line of mercy and
[1:23:31] judgment. There's no hope for you. Amen.
[1:23:32] You should have done better. The reason
[1:23:34] this has happened is because of your
[1:23:35] what you've done in your past and all
[1:23:37] these things. You condemn that tongue in
[1:23:39] the name of Jesus Christ. Don't let that
[1:23:41] thing beat you, beat you up. No. The
[1:23:42] Lord is your helper. He's your strength.
[1:23:44] And this weapon will not prosper against
[1:23:46] you. It will fall at your feet. You'll
[1:23:48] walk out victorious. Amen. That'll kill
[1:23:50] a big vulture. I tell you what. Amen.
[1:23:53] This is the heritage of the servants of
[1:23:54] the Lord. And their righteousness is of
[1:23:57] me, sayeth the Lord. I like that. Our
[1:24:00] righteousness is not of ourselves. It's
[1:24:02] of him.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Surely he has
[1:24:07] borne our griefs. He's carried our
[1:24:09] sorrows. Yet we did esteem him stricken,
[1:24:11] smitten of God, and afflicted. He was
[1:24:13] wounded for our transgressions. He was
[1:24:15] bruised for our iniquities. The chastise
[1:24:17] of our peace was upon him, and with his
[1:24:19] stripes we are healed. All we like sheep
[1:24:22] have gone astray. We have turned
[1:24:23] everyone to his own way. And the Lord
[1:24:25] hath laid on him the iniquity of us all
[1:24:28] that covers every sin, every trouble,
[1:24:30] everything that could be held against
[1:24:31] you. He took it.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. But my God shall supply all of
[1:24:35] your needs according to his riches and
[1:24:37] glory by Christ Jesus.
[1:24:40] Amen. I just got a I just got two more.
[1:24:42] Let your conversation be without
[1:24:44] covetousness, and be content with such
[1:24:46] things as you have, for he hath said, I
[1:24:48] will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
[1:24:50] Amen. So that we may boldly say,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; not boldly, the Lord is my helper. Let's
[1:24:56] say that now. The Lord is my helper.
[1:24:59] Amen. And I will not fear what man shall
[1:25:01] do unto me. Why? Because he is my
[1:25:03] helper. Hallelujah.
[1:25:05] Amen. Here's another one. Cuz the, you
[1:25:07] know, the world loves to loves to make
[1:25:10] things or the devil likes to make us
[1:25:12] think that things are totally out of our
[1:25:14] grasp. the situations are too complex,
[1:25:16] too, you know, we just can't get a hold
[1:25:19] of things. It's totally overwhelming.
[1:25:21] Well, therefore, you lack wisdom. But if
[1:25:24] you lack wisdom, ask of him.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; And he see and he giveth to all men
[1:25:29] liberally and uprath not. So, he doesn't
[1:25:32] get offended when you say, "Lord, I need
[1:25:33] wisdom." He's like, "Good.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give it to you, and it
[1:25:36] shall be given to him."
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; I mean, he gives it liberally, not just
[1:25:39] a little bit. He gives an abundance of
[1:25:40] wisdom. Lord, I need help in this
[1:25:42] situation. there's these there's these,
[1:25:44] you know, crows crowing around in my
[1:25:47] mind. I got trouble. I don't know how to
[1:25:48] sort the situation out of my family or
[1:25:50] my life. And what can I do? And he says,
[1:25:53] I'll give you wisdom. I'll show you how
[1:25:54] to take that shotgun, lead it a little
[1:25:56] bit, blast it away. Amen. And he'll give
[1:26:00] the answer.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. What are all these things? This is
[1:26:04] this is this is this is weapons. This is
[1:26:05] armies going into no man's land. So, you
[1:26:08] got to put soldiers on the battlefield.
[1:26:10] Amen. Give God something to work with.
[1:26:13] It's like many times we say, "Lord,
[1:26:14] deliver me. Help me." It should, that's
[1:26:16] a good prayer, but it should be, "Lord,
[1:26:18] show me how you can use my faith in my
[1:26:20] life to overcome this obstacle, right?
[1:26:23] Like David, you know, he's fighting the
[1:26:25] Philistines and he's, you know, he's
[1:26:26] behind the Malbury trees or even before
[1:26:28] that and and he's asking Lord, Lord, how
[1:26:31] do I fight this enemy?" He's not saying,
[1:26:33] "Lord, deliver me, help me, and fight my
[1:26:34] battles." He realizes God's going to use
[1:26:37] him to fight the battles, right? And he
[1:26:39] but he's trusting in not in his own
[1:26:40] ability. He's trusting in God anointing
[1:26:42] them to be victorious. So he's saying,
[1:26:44] "God, show me what I need to do to
[1:26:47] overcome this enemy." That's putting
[1:26:49] faith into action.
[1:26:51] Amen.
[1:26:53] Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; I want to go back to this because I want
[1:26:57] to finish with this
[1:26:59] if I can find it here.
[1:27:07] He says, "As Solomon said, as a man
[1:27:09] thinkketh in his heart, so is he." Begin
[1:27:11] to think that you're one of his
[1:27:13] children, that he saved you and he's
[1:27:15] good to you and you love him and he
[1:27:17] loves you. Don't just wait till you go
[1:27:19] to church or some convenient hour, just
[1:27:21] keep him on your mind all the time. And
[1:27:24] as she went on walking down the street,
[1:27:25] this is speaking about Mary going to the
[1:27:27] well. Uh there was uh no one yet on the
[1:27:30] street. As she walked along the little
[1:27:32] dirt path of a sidewalk, all of a
[1:27:34] sudden, she began to realize there was
[1:27:36] something around her. A real strange
[1:27:38] feeling. Oh, that's the most wonderful
[1:27:41] experience. I trust that everyone here
[1:27:42] has experienced them kind of times. If
[1:27:44] you haven't, this would be a good night
[1:27:46] to start. Just start thinking about him
[1:27:48] and worship him in your heart. And all
[1:27:50] of a sudden, you'll feel the close
[1:27:52] fellowship of the Holy Spirit all around
[1:27:55] you. And you get so anointed till you
[1:27:57] can't hold it any longer. you raise up
[1:27:59] your hands and will do something you
[1:28:01] just can't stand still when it comes.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; This is not theory. This is reality.
[1:28:09] Who's had experience like being to think
[1:28:11] on the Lord, meditate on his goodness,
[1:28:13] and the atmosphere around you changes?
[1:28:15] That's him.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; That's him drawing close. That's you
[1:28:18] actually inviting him into your
[1:28:20] presence.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; That's why you sing melodies and psalms
[1:28:24] and things to the Lord. You've been to
[1:28:25] think on him and how great he is. It
[1:28:27] draws him close. That's you drawing nigh
[1:28:29] to God. And if you want angels to appear
[1:28:32] to you, keep your mind on God and off
[1:28:34] the things of the world. Go about your
[1:28:35] business. Go to your church. Go to your
[1:28:37] washing of dishes. Whatever you are,
[1:28:39] keep your mind on him all day and all
[1:28:41] night long. Then God will do something.
[1:28:43] You're drawing close to him. You've got
[1:28:45] the world shut out. Just you and he are
[1:28:48] together.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Who wants that?
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; We can have that more than we've ever
[1:28:54] had in our entire lives. We can have God
[1:28:56] literally come into your house.
[1:28:59] We had it during co I remember John
[1:29:01] Andy's was preaching about the angel of
[1:29:02] the Lord coming down neighborhoods and
[1:29:04] meeting needs and answering prayers and
[1:29:06] all these things. And so so we had a
[1:29:08] time of prayer after one of those
[1:29:09] meetings and and and and the Lord
[1:29:11] visited our house.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; It's not a one-time thing. He can visit
[1:29:17] every day. You say, "But he's in me."
[1:29:20] But he can visit every day. He can step
[1:29:22] into your house into whatever you're
[1:29:23] going through and just you start
[1:29:25] thinking on him because when he comes
[1:29:28] the supernatural happens lives are
[1:29:30] changed. Hearts are touched. Wayward
[1:29:32] ones faith comes. Blindness leaves.
[1:29:34] Spirits leave when he comes. Amen. God
[1:29:37] brings the answer. God heals. God raises
[1:29:39] the dead. God does when he comes.
[1:29:41] Everything is over when he comes. So
[1:29:44] that's why, you know, when we invite him
[1:29:46] in, what we're doing? We're letting the
[1:29:47] battle go into his hand. You say, "Well,
[1:29:50] it's just like I'm hitting a brick wall
[1:29:51] with my family." Invite him and let him
[1:29:54] change the atmosphere and soften hearts.
[1:29:57] And you will see what he will do.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram would tell the story
[1:30:02] here. He'd say, "If I can find this,
[1:30:07] he speaks about two ladies. They went to
[1:30:09] a they went to a meeting. Maybe I can't
[1:30:12] find it here, but well, I'll just tell
[1:30:14] it. They went to a meeting and then, you
[1:30:16] know, they went across the prayer line.
[1:30:18] and one had cancer and one had a goiter
[1:30:20] or something and you know but they went
[1:30:21] across the prayer line and you know and
[1:30:23] and and and the Lord said well through
[1:30:25] the prophet you're healed but for 6
[1:30:28] weeks the healing hadn't come yet but
[1:30:30] they took that promise and they believe
[1:30:32] no God said I'm healed so God will bring
[1:30:35] it to manifestation so one had problems
[1:30:37] she couldn't eat anything barely and she
[1:30:39] was had trouble eating things for 6
[1:30:41] weeks but then there came a day where
[1:30:43] Jesus started walking down the
[1:30:44] neighborhood and came into her house and
[1:30:46] she felt this cool feeling come over
[1:30:48] her. Then she picked up something that
[1:30:49] made her sick and drank it. Felt fine.
[1:30:51] She started eating a whole bunch of
[1:30:52] food. And then she realized, well, the
[1:30:54] feast come my way. He's coming to my
[1:30:56] neighbor's way who has the cancer. And
[1:30:58] then so she ran to her neighbor. Her
[1:30:59] neighbors, brother says, was all was on
[1:31:01] all fours screaming and praising God
[1:31:04] because the cancer left her body. Why?
[1:31:06] Cuz the angel of the Lord came and
[1:31:07] confirmed the prayer that, you know,
[1:31:09] that happened for them in the meeting.
[1:31:11] Why? But what they do, they begin to
[1:31:12] thank the Lord. Lord, thank you.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Your word is true. You've told me I'm
[1:31:17] healed. His word says we're we're
[1:31:19] healed.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let doubt come in and say,
[1:31:21] "Well, it hasn't happened yet." Time is
[1:31:24] irrelevant to God. Just keep praising
[1:31:26] him and thank him and God will come down
[1:31:28] and visit us in our homes and meet our
[1:31:31] needs. Is that okay?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; He did it back then. He'll do it in
[1:31:35] 2025. Oh, he'll never come to my home.
[1:31:39] Yeah, he will roll out the red carpet.
[1:31:42] Think today's the day. Well, if it's not
[1:31:44] today, it'll be tomorrow. Jesus is going
[1:31:46] to come by my way. The Lord of glory is
[1:31:48] going to come into my house. That to me
[1:31:50] that's very exciting.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; That's incredibly exciting that Jesus
[1:31:53] could come to my house and I want him
[1:31:55] and he always comes where he's invited.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You know, so if you
[1:32:02] begin to think upon him, then all of the
[1:32:06] all of and you think on his testimonies
[1:32:08] and what he's done, it brings him into
[1:32:10] the present tense, right? because we
[1:32:13] have the ability by faith to call him
[1:32:15] out of history. Amen. This is what this
[1:32:17] message has done. It's lifted God out of
[1:32:19] history and brought him into the
[1:32:21] present. Amen. So like you know like
[1:32:24] blind Barameus, he was he was told by
[1:32:26] his mom when he was young all the great
[1:32:28] Bible stories of what God did in
[1:32:30] Jericho. You know how you know how
[1:32:32] Joshua came over and Rahab was there and
[1:32:34] you know she put the token down, she put
[1:32:36] down the scarlet rope and the people
[1:32:38] that all got into the house was saved
[1:32:39] when when Joshua went around the walls
[1:32:42] and you know shouted and all those
[1:32:43] things their house didn't fall down flat
[1:32:46] you know and would tell about the Jordan
[1:32:47] there about how the priest would you
[1:32:50] know put his put his foot in the put his
[1:32:52] foot in the Jordan with the ark and it
[1:32:53] parted the Israelites crossed over and
[1:32:56] you know when Elijah was there and he
[1:32:57] and he struck the Jordan it parted and
[1:32:59] him and Elisha parted over and there
[1:33:01] was, you know, Elijah went up in the
[1:33:02] chariot ride. I'm just condensing a
[1:33:03] whole bunch of stories into real, right?
[1:33:05] But, but she would drill into him. Our
[1:33:07] God did these things right here. Amen.
[1:33:12] And what can we do even in 2025? We can
[1:33:14] say, "And our God
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; did mighty things right here." And he's
[1:33:18] the same God today. Sure, we can go back
[1:33:20] to the Bible. We can go back to Brother
[1:33:22] Bram. But we can say, "And our God, the
[1:33:25] God that did those things is the same
[1:33:27] Jesus Christ that does the same things
[1:33:28] here." Amen. And he's alive today. Amen.
[1:33:31] So you can take all those things and you
[1:33:33] begin to think on those testimonies.
[1:33:34] What does it do? It changes your
[1:33:36] thinking. Well, if he did it back there,
[1:33:38] he can do it for me. Amen. If he can
[1:33:40] heal that person, he can heal me. If he
[1:33:43] can deliver that person, he can deliver
[1:33:44] me.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he can mend that family, he can
[1:33:47] mend my family. He can do anything.
[1:33:50] Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, so he began to
[1:33:53] think because his mama told her told him
[1:33:56] of the reality of God.
[1:33:59] But you see now the priest he, you know,
[1:34:01] he would sit there blind and, you know,
[1:34:03] he'd think about you, he he'd sit there,
[1:34:05] you know, uh, the gates of Jericho and
[1:34:07] it was, you know, he'd warm himself
[1:34:08] against the walls of the city because
[1:34:10] the, you know, stones would absorb the
[1:34:12] heat and he'd warm himself against the
[1:34:14] walls of the city. He'd be think about
[1:34:15] what his mama would tell him when he was
[1:34:17] young. and he'd think, "Oh, if I could
[1:34:19] only be there when great, you know, when
[1:34:22] great Jehovah was there, then, you know,
[1:34:23] if if only I was there, those those
[1:34:26] prophets would put their hands upon me
[1:34:28] and they would pronounce me well and I'd
[1:34:30] get my sight back." But he says, he
[1:34:32] says, "But my the priest just tell me
[1:34:34] the days of miracles is passed. There's
[1:34:36] no such a thing as Jehovah doing such
[1:34:38] things now. We just keep the law."
[1:34:41] Friends, don't let no one put that down
[1:34:44] into your head
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; that we're living in a day of just an
[1:34:48] intellectual understanding. We're just
[1:34:50] wanting to, oh, the word's come open.
[1:34:52] It's a bride's revival. It's a word
[1:34:53] revival. What does that do? It brings
[1:34:55] the supernatural out like never before.
[1:34:58] It brings the reality of God out like
[1:34:59] never before. When the word has come
[1:35:01] open in the history in history, the
[1:35:04] supernatural has followed to prove that
[1:35:06] it's come open. Right? happened in Moses
[1:35:10] day, happened when Jesus was here,
[1:35:12] happened through the reformation. The
[1:35:14] supernatural followed every revival. So
[1:35:17] why would it not follow this revival? I
[1:35:19] say it does. But so never let someone
[1:35:21] put that down your throat that no, God
[1:35:23] doesn't do those things. We don't need
[1:35:24] miracles anymore. We need miracles.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; We need divine healing. We need the
[1:35:29] devil to be cast out. We need tongues
[1:35:31] interpretation. We need prophecy. We
[1:35:33] need every gift of the body. We need
[1:35:34] every supernatural thing God could do.
[1:35:36] We need it. You say, "No, we don't."
[1:35:39] Well, we if you have sickness or or some
[1:35:41] kind of thing happen in your family, you
[1:35:42] realize, "I need God." Amen. We need the
[1:35:45] supernatural. Oh, we don't need angels
[1:35:47] to visit our homes. Yes, we do.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't need God to do that. Oh,
[1:35:51] that was just in the prophet's day and
[1:35:52] that's good enough. No, it's not.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't like looking at a
[1:35:57] painted fire.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; You can have a video. You can have I
[1:36:00] don't know what the what's the highest
[1:36:01] resolution, 8K or 16K. You can have the
[1:36:04] fanciest ultra real screen with a fire
[1:36:09] on it. That doesn't excite me none. I
[1:36:12] can't get warm by it.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; All it does is actually make me resent
[1:36:16] the fact it's not real,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; But you get a real fire. It can be a
[1:36:21] little thing, but if it gives a bit of
[1:36:22] warmth, I'm happy, right? Because it's
[1:36:24] actually real,
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; right? And we do not have a painted fire
[1:36:27] of yes, 50 years ago the prophet was
[1:36:30] here and the angel of the Lord was here,
[1:36:31] but now it's different. It ain't
[1:36:32] different. That same mighty angel Christ
[1:36:35] is with us today.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Who lives in you? It's him. Right? So we
[1:36:39] never never let no one say, "Well, we
[1:36:41] just got to keep the word. It's just
[1:36:42] like this." No. The same God there is
[1:36:45] the same God to make the word live
[1:36:48] today.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And as he was sitting there thinking
[1:36:52] about those things because what was on
[1:36:54] his mind?
[1:36:55] Jehovah God. He's a God of miracles.
[1:36:59] What did he find himself happening when
[1:37:01] he was there warming himself by the
[1:37:03] walls of the walls of the city thinking
[1:37:05] if only he could see that Jehovah of
[1:37:07] miracles again? The Jehovah of miracles
[1:37:10] more than a prophet, more than a holy
[1:37:12] man, Jehovah made flesh was walking past
[1:37:15] him cuz he was thinking about him. And
[1:37:18] what was on Jehovah's mind? What was on
[1:37:19] Jesus' mind? Calvary. Cuz he was going
[1:37:22] there into Jerusalem, there to the
[1:37:25] cross, to the grave, then ascend. that
[1:37:27] that was what was on his mind. But
[1:37:30] because because you know there was a big
[1:37:32] noise was going on because where Jesus
[1:37:33] is there's always a little noise around
[1:37:35] and you know and and blind Barameus was
[1:37:37] sitting there saying who's this? I
[1:37:39] haven't heard this kind of a ruckus
[1:37:40] before of you know because some were
[1:37:42] crying out hosana others were crying out
[1:37:44] he's be elabub and all this kind of
[1:37:46] confusion going on where he was but he
[1:37:49] asked began to ask people what who is
[1:37:51] this Jesus of Nazareth? these people,
[1:37:53] who is this person? And some kind old
[1:37:56] lady sat down and said, "Bardameus, I'll
[1:37:58] tell you what I've heard about him."
[1:38:00] Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Lazarus came out of the tomb.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; The storms were sealed. Amen. The blind
[1:38:07] received their sight. The cripples
[1:38:09] walked. The lame could run. Amen. Demons
[1:38:11] were cast out. This is what this man has
[1:38:13] done. And what happened now? because his
[1:38:15] mind was on the God that did these
[1:38:17] things. He realized the very God that
[1:38:19] did those miracles was walking right
[1:38:21] past him. So what did that do? That
[1:38:23] built a faith in his life cuz he was
[1:38:25] thinking about the right things. It
[1:38:27] caused God to walk right past him. He
[1:38:29] cried out, "Jesus of Nazareth, son of
[1:38:31] David, have mercy on me." Amen. And
[1:38:33] people tried to say, "Be quiet." He
[1:38:35] said, "No, I must get a touch from the
[1:38:37] master. That's why he's walking this
[1:38:38] way, cuz so I can get a touch." He cried
[1:38:41] all the more. And it wasn't his lips,
[1:38:43] his voice, his noise that he made. It
[1:38:45] was his faith and said, "And Jesus stood
[1:38:48] still
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; and said, "Go get him." Why? Because his
[1:38:53] mind
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; was on the right things.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus stood still. And he was no longer
[1:39:00] blind Barameus. After that, he was
[1:39:03] seeing. He was Barameus.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he
[1:39:08] was thinking on the right things.
[1:39:11] naturally he could never get his eyes
[1:39:12] back. Don't think about naturally how
[1:39:14] things can work out. Think about what
[1:39:17] God can do in your situation.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Brand was invited, you
[1:39:22] know, to a hospital and someone's um I
[1:39:24] can't remember who it was, but you know,
[1:39:25] their their their vitals that were
[1:39:27] coming up on the charts and the
[1:39:28] instruments was saying there's no way
[1:39:30] this boy can live because he's dropped
[1:39:32] below a certain level of heart rate or
[1:39:34] whatever it is. I can't remember. But
[1:39:36] but his parents invited brother to come
[1:39:38] and pray for the son. And then brother
[1:39:41] Bam came and prayed for him and the and
[1:39:44] the mom and dad were just rejoicing.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; So happy that their son was going to get
[1:39:49] well,
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; but his vitals were still very low. And
[1:39:51] the nurse was actually saying, "No, this
[1:39:53] is wrong. Be quiet. How could you do
[1:39:54] this?" And you know, and and and and the
[1:39:57] old dad just said to the nurse, "Look,
[1:39:58] look, look, honey, you're looking you're
[1:40:01] trained to look at these things, right?
[1:40:03] The vitals and the numbers. We're
[1:40:06] looking at a promise, and it's never
[1:40:08] failed." and he came back. He was
[1:40:10] healthy, strong and well. Got out of
[1:40:12] that hospital. Why? Because their mind
[1:40:14] was God is able to fulfill his word and
[1:40:17] God fulfilled it. They weren't looking
[1:40:19] at natural things. So take the natural
[1:40:21] things off your mind. It's got to be a
[1:40:22] certain way and you know, nature's got
[1:40:25] to take its course. We're not waiting
[1:40:28] for nature to take its course. We're
[1:40:30] waiting for God to fulfill his word.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Let God take his course. Right? So let's
[1:40:36] have the musicians this morning.
[1:40:39] I say friends, let's invite the Lord
[1:40:41] Jesus.
[1:40:42] They say, "What do I do?" Open your
[1:40:45] heart. Think on him. It'll produce an
[1:40:48] expectation
[1:40:50] and God will do the miraculous.
[1:40:53] Amen.
[1:40:57] Amen. Let's um I want to stand. Let's
[1:40:59] sing our God is tremendous
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; because he's tremendous. Amen.
[1:41:17] Amen. When I'm in need, I call on the
[1:41:19] Lord and he hears me.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, he helps me. He is faithful and
[1:41:26] true. Won't forget his own. I'm reading
[1:41:28] this. I want you to think about what
[1:41:30] you're singing. You say, "Well, I don't
[1:41:32] know what to sing as I'm going about my
[1:41:33] day." This is a good song.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; He hears me. Thank you, Lord. You hear
[1:41:38] me? Then you just go off into prayer and
[1:41:39] rejoicing. What? It gives you a peace
[1:41:41] and a stability.
[1:41:43] Amen.
[1:41:46] Amen. Let's go.
[1:41:48] I'm in need. I call on the Lord
[1:41:53] and he hears me. Yes, he helps me. He is
[1:41:58] faithful
[1:42:00] and true. won't forget his own.
[1:42:06] My companion,
[1:42:08] my best friend, the only true God.
[1:42:13] There's no one greater, a wonderful
[1:42:16] savior,
[1:42:18] is Jesus, the lion, a shooter.
[1:42:23] Our God is tremendous. His strength
[1:42:27] never failing. He'll go through the fire
[1:42:30] just to save a sinner. Yes, he the
[1:42:34] almighty.
[1:42:35] He sends his angels
[1:42:38] to guide me.
[1:42:41] There is no stone too powerful. How God
[1:42:45] cannot handle how God is simplicity
[1:42:49] revealed in you and me. Came down from
[1:42:52] his glory and gave us the victory. The
[1:42:56] greatest love story.
[1:43:00] When you're in trouble, Jehovah is the
[1:43:05] great and fuller as he only will fight
[1:43:10] your battles.
[1:43:12] Oh yes, he will stand for you.
[1:43:18] Your victory will come not the way that
[1:43:21] you think it should, but my great
[1:43:24] Jehovah, we just love the paradox to
[1:43:28] stay in your position and watch the
[1:43:31] miraculous
[1:43:32] come into action.
[1:43:36] Our God is tremendous. His strength
[1:43:40] never failing. He'll go through the fire
[1:43:43] just to save a sinner. Yes, he is
[1:43:47] almighty.
[1:43:48] He says his angels
[1:43:51] to guide me.
[1:43:55] There is no storm too powerful. Our God
[1:43:58] cannot handle. Our God is simplicity
[1:44:02] revealed in you and me. Came down from
[1:44:05] his glory and gave us the victory. The
[1:44:09] greatest love story.
[1:44:13] Our God is tremendous. His strength
[1:44:17] never failing. He'll go through the fire
[1:44:20] just to save a sinner. Yet he's the
[1:44:24] Almighty.
[1:44:26] He said everything
[1:44:27] [Applause]
[1:44:32] there
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:34] [Applause]
[1:44:38] simplicity
[1:44:39] [Music]
[1:44:42] came down from the floor
[1:44:44] gave us the
[1:44:47] greatest love Glory.
[1:44:50] [Music]
[1:44:51] [Applause]
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:45:17] done. Um when Gabriel was born, he had
[1:45:21] um a list of things that they said was
[1:45:23] wrong with him. I don't think me and
[1:45:25] Mari ever accepted any of them for
[1:45:26] Gabriel on his behalf. Um one of them
[1:45:29] was he had a heart moment which pretty
[1:45:31] much means he had a hole in his heart.
[1:45:32] Um so that was there. Um we went in for
[1:45:37] uh it's called an echo at one years old
[1:45:39] and he still had like the the murmur
[1:45:41] which means that he was a heart in his
[1:45:43] hole uh a hole in his heart. Um, but he
[1:45:47] went for an echo recently and that hole
[1:45:49] has closed up. So, his heart is fully
[1:45:52] normal. So, I just want to give all the
[1:45:54] glory to God. I'm very thankful that my
[1:45:56] boy is whole and well and his heart is
[1:45:58] normal.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Our God's a healer.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:15] Here's
[1:46:25] [Music]
[1:46:29] an exercise for later. Try and think
[1:46:31] something different to what you're
[1:46:33] saying.
[1:46:35] Try and do it later. You'll find you
[1:46:36] can't do it. So, if your mind is all
[1:46:38] negative and down, start confessing
[1:46:40] positive. It will tell that thing to
[1:46:42] shut up,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; right? And because when you confess it,
[1:46:46] it tells us to be quiet. But then when
[1:46:48] you confess the word, God is our high
[1:46:50] priest can now act on your confession.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Right? So don't confess. If you're
[1:46:55] thinking negative negative, confess
[1:46:56] positive. And if you're thinking
[1:46:58] positive, confess positive. Okay? Amen.
[1:47:01] But victory is mine. Let's just open our
[1:47:04] hearts and praise the Lord. And Amen.
[1:47:06] Oh, victory is mine. Victory is mine.
[1:47:11] Victory today is mine.
[1:47:16] While I told Satan to get me behind
[1:47:22] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:47:26] and love is mine. Yes, love is mine.
[1:47:32] Love today is mine.
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:37] I told Satan to get me behind
[1:47:42] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:47:46] and joy is mine. Joy is mine. Joy today
[1:47:54] is mine.
[1:47:57] And I told Satan to get me behind
[1:48:02] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:07] And peace is mine. Peace is mine. Peace
[1:48:13] today is mine.
[1:48:17] Well, I told Satan to get me behind
[1:48:22] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:27] Well, I got up this morning. I didn't
[1:48:31] have no doubt. I knew that the Lord
[1:48:34] would bring me out.
[1:48:37] So, I got down on my knees. Said, "Lord,
[1:48:41] how I got up on my feet with victory.
[1:48:48] Oh, he is mine." Yes, he is mine.
[1:48:54] Today is
[1:48:57] [Applause]
[1:48:59] Satan to get me behind
[1:49:03] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:08] The Holy Ghost is mine. The Holy Ghost
[1:49:12] is mine. The Holy Ghost today is mine.
[1:49:18] I told Satan to get me behind
[1:49:23] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:29] Temperance is mine.
[1:49:31] Temperance is mine.
[1:49:34] Temperance today is high.
[1:49:39] I told Satan to get me behind
[1:49:44] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:49] And perfect.
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:59] I told
[1:50:01] you to get me
[1:50:04] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:09] I got this morning. I didn't have no
[1:50:13] doubt. I knew that the Lord would bring
[1:50:17] me out.
[1:50:19] So I got down.
[1:50:22] I said, "Lord, help me." I got my
[1:50:27] victory.
[1:50:32] Theure is mine. The rapture today is
[1:50:37] mine.
[1:50:40] I sat to get me behind
[1:50:45] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:50] My family is mine. My family is mine. My
[1:50:55] family
[1:50:57] is mine.
[1:51:00] Well, I told Satan to get me
[1:51:06] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:10] And all things are
[1:51:13] all things are mine. All things from God
[1:51:19] [Applause]
[1:51:23] to get me
[1:51:26] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:31] And happiness is mine.
[1:51:34] Happiness is mine.
[1:51:36] Happiness today is mine.
[1:51:41] I told Satan to get me behind
[1:51:46] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:51] Eternal life is mine. Eternal life is
[1:51:55] mine. Eternal life today is mine.
[1:52:00] [Applause]
[1:52:02] Well, I told Satan to get me behind.
[1:52:07] Eternal life today is mine.
[1:52:12] Amen. Amen. You believe that this
[1:52:14] morning? Hallelujah. Amen. Let's bow our
[1:52:17] heads in a word of prayers. And if you
[1:52:19] want to be remembered, say, "Lord, help
[1:52:20] me, dear God. My mind would be full of
[1:52:22] you, your word, your goodness." Amen. We
[1:52:25] love the Lord with all thy mind. Amen.
[1:52:27] Gracious heavenly father, Lord, to think
[1:52:29] dear God to love you with all our soul,
[1:52:32] mind, and strength, Father, and to love
[1:52:35] our neighbor as thyself. Your whole word
[1:52:38] hangs on those two commandments. So,
[1:52:40] Father, I pray, dear God, as we go into
[1:52:41] this week, may our minds be full of your
[1:52:44] promises, full of your goodness, Lord.
[1:52:47] May our minds be full of testimonies,
[1:52:49] dear God, of of when you have fulfilled
[1:52:51] your word. May our minds be full of
[1:52:53] singing, of rejoicing, Lord, of
[1:52:56] thanksgiving, Lord, cuz you're the
[1:52:57] almighty God that made heavens and
[1:52:59] earth. You're the almighty God that
[1:53:01] carried our sins far away. You're the
[1:53:03] almighty God that fulfills your word,
[1:53:05] Lord Jesus. And you're our God, and we
[1:53:08] are your children, Lord. So, I pray may
[1:53:10] we think on these things, Lord. I didn't
[1:53:12] get to the scripture, but it says in
[1:53:14] Philippians that all things that are
[1:53:15] good and honest, of good report, have
[1:53:17] any virtue, think on these things. So
[1:53:20] may we do that Lord into this week. And

[1:58:57] Amen. Let's pray this morning.
[1:59:01] Lord, we thank you that you've made us
[1:59:03] in such a way,
[1:59:06] Lord, that we can have a choice to have
[1:59:08] faith in you or to doubt you, Lord. And
[1:59:12] we choose this morning as believers to
[1:59:14] have faith in your word. We choose to,
[1:59:17] Lord, only let our minds, Lord, venture
[1:59:21] out into the on the pathway of faith.
[1:59:23] Lord, we don't want to venture on the
[1:59:24] pathway of doubt, on the pathway of
[1:59:26] unbelief, on the pathway of fear, on the
[1:59:29] pathway of hopelessness or helplessness
[1:59:32] or or or Lord, loneliness or thinking,
[1:59:37] Lord, that you're not a God that
[1:59:39] provides, you're not a God that heals,
[1:59:41] you're not a God that that sees or
[1:59:43] hears. Lord, we want we we venture along
[1:59:44] the path of faith where we know you're
[1:59:46] the you're the healer. You're the
[1:59:47] redeemer. You're the savior. You're the
[1:59:49] provider, Lord. And regardless of what
[1:59:52] the situation might be, we focus our
[1:59:54] mind on those things, Lord. We focus our
[1:59:56] mind upon your word.
[1:59:58] As your word says, God is not a man that
[2:00:00] he should lie,
[2:00:03] neither son of man that he should
[2:00:04] repent. Lord, hath he not spoken and
[2:00:07] shall he not do it, Lord. And we
[2:00:09] perceive you to be a man of your word
[2:00:11] this morning. So help us each day to
[2:00:14] Lord to focus our minds upon you, our
[2:00:16] thoughts. And we thank you that we can
[2:00:18] only think one thought at the same time.
[2:00:20] We thank you we be we've been given that
[2:00:21] choice Lord that if we choose faith then
[2:00:23] that's what we choose. If we choose
[2:00:25] faith in your word then faith in your
[2:00:27] word it is. Lord it's that simple we
[2:00:29] are. Thank you that you've made each one
[2:00:30] of us able to be overcomers in every
[2:00:32] situation. That you've given us a you've
[2:00:34] given us the option to overcome every
[2:00:36] situation. Lord there's there's nothing
[2:00:38] nothing in the world stopping us. Though
[2:00:41] I may try, Lord, those situations and
[2:00:42] circumstances and demons and every other
[2:00:45] thought might try, Lord, but there's
[2:00:46] nothing in the world that truly can
[2:00:48] overcome us if we just have faith in
[2:00:49] you, Lord. So, I just pray a blessing
[2:00:51] upon each one here this morning. May you
[2:00:52] bless us as we go our way. Thank you,
[2:00:54] Lord, that each one here is victorious,
[2:00:57] Lord. And I thank you for the testimony
[2:00:58] of um Lord, this morning of little
[2:01:01] Gabriel, Lord, and the thought came to
[2:01:03] me, Lord, that we they were brother Ben
[2:01:06] was talking about the hole that he had
[2:01:07] in his heart and it wasn't quite
[2:01:08] complete, Lord. But I thank you now that
[2:01:09] he can worship you with his whole heart,
[2:01:12] Lord, that for from this day forth, for
[2:01:14] the rest of his life, he'll worship you
[2:01:16] with his whole heart, Lord. So I just
[2:01:17] pray that blessing upon him. Thank you
[2:01:19] for putting him in our midst, Lord. He's
[2:01:20] a he he's he seems to have something
[2:01:23] special about him, little Gabriel. So I
[2:01:24] just pray you'll continue to bless the
[2:01:26] family and bless him and his health as
[2:01:28] well. I pray commit each one here to
[2:01:30] your hands in Jesus wonderful name.
[2:01:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you all
[2:01:34] this morning. You dismissed in Jesus
[2:01:35] name.

[2:04:05] of yours.
[2:04:12] And as you speak,
[2:04:17] a 100 billion creatures catch your
[2:04:22] breath.
[2:04:25] evolving is cute of what you say.
[2:04:33] If it all reveals your nature so
[2:04:38] alive,
[2:04:41] I can see your heart in everything you
[2:04:46] say.
[2:04:49] Every painted sky, your canvas of your
[2:04:54] grace.
[2:04:57] If creation still obeys you, so
[2:05:02] will I.
[2:05:06] If creation still obeys you, so will I.
[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:14] If the stars were made to worship, so
[2:05:18] will I.

[2:05:40] exists to lift you high, so alive.
[2:05:46] If the wind goes where you send it, so
[2:05:50] alive.
[2:05:54] When the rocks cry out in silence, so
[2:05:58] will I.
[2:06:00] [Music]
[2:06:01] If the song of all our praises still
[2:06:05] fall shine,
[2:06:09] then we sing again
[2:06:13] billion times.
[2:06:17] Oh,

[2:06:29] You chase down my heart through all of
[2:06:32] my failure and pride.
[2:06:41] On a hill you create
[2:06:46] the light of the world and end in
[2:06:49] darkness to die.
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:06:57] And as you speak,
[2:07:02] a 100 billion failures disappear.
[2:07:09] Will you lost your life so I could find
[2:07:14] it here?

[2:07:31] alive.
[2:07:34] I can see your heart and everything
[2:07:38] you've done.

[2:07:55] life.

[2:08:26] alive
[2:08:29] like you would again a h 100 billion
[2:08:33] times.
[2:08:37] But what pleasure
[2:08:39] amount to your needs are.
