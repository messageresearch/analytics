[18:17] who would love to be first
[18:20] all right
[18:24] so i've got a testimony about um the
[18:28] the sunday night um
[18:31] when brother alpha was preaching
[18:33] he said um how he had an experience and
[18:37] i said that i want to have an experience
[18:38] like that
[18:39] and he said that you can have it right
[18:41] now
[18:42] and i went up at the altar and i got
[18:44] that experience
[18:46] [Applause]
[18:59] i want to testify about sunday night um
[19:02] yeah got hit by the four gospels just
[19:04] before christina um
[19:06] started her tongues
[19:08] um it was like the holy ghost my back
[19:11] all the way to my head it was like no
[19:13] drug head i've ever had before and i had
[19:15] a few when i was in the world so yeah it
[19:17] was like it was absolutely amazing
[19:19] the power of god was so good
[19:22] [Applause]
[19:30] i just want to thank god for camp and
[19:32] thank you that we could have a great
[19:33] time um it was a real revival for me and
[19:37] speaker and lily and i just wanna i'm
[19:40] really happy for lily and she got
[19:41] baptized as well
[19:44] [Applause]
[19:49] um
[19:51] i was praying to god that i knew
[19:54] that he would move on someone but i was
[19:56] also thinking god can you move on to me
[20:00] and i was only expecting god to do it
[20:02] once but he did it twice in two
[20:03] different sermons and
[20:13] uh i think we all have a testimony about
[20:15] sunday night
[20:17] and um i think what the place i'm coming
[20:19] from is just
[20:21] how thankful i am with the lord on this
[20:23] prayer directly
[20:25] and
[20:26] there is little testimony about us um
[20:28] youth we get together monday nights
[20:30] and um we pray
[20:32] so the first time we got together
[20:34] first thing up on the list was camp
[20:37] and we prayed for every aspect for camp
[20:40] for the lord to come down for the lord
[20:41] to hear us
[20:42] and you know what he did and i just want
[20:45] to thank the lord for that
[20:48] [Applause]
[21:01] this isn't really a testimony about like
[21:03] on camp but
[21:05] yesterday when we were working in the
[21:06] garden
[21:08] i was busy like packing
[21:10] rocks to make a little path and my dad
[21:12] was chopping wood by me
[21:15] and when he was chopping the wood he hit
[21:17] the wood and it bounced off and it came
[21:19] at my head but before that at lunch my
[21:22] brother
[21:23] liam he prayed for us and protection
[21:27] and when the ex came towards me it just
[21:31] stopped and i thank god that he saved me
[21:34] [Applause]
[21:46] um so on the way to camp i was in my in
[21:50] my car praying that um the lord would
[21:52] touch me in a way that i've never been
[21:53] touched before
[21:55] and
[21:56] he did that on sunday night and
[21:58] it just amazed me like we know that god
[22:01] answers prayer but like when he does
[22:03] it's just so amazing and it never ceases
[22:05] to amaze me so
[22:10] yeah man
[22:19] warning signs um
[22:21] just want to add to the rumored
[22:23] testimony but i first want to say camp
[22:26] was awesome
[22:29] it was
[22:30] when i went back
[22:32] uh to work somebody asked me you know
[22:34] how was your weekend
[22:37] all i could say is i don't want to be
[22:40] i don't want to be here right now it was
[22:41] so amazing and i got to testify and i
[22:43] said to him
[22:44] go to a place
[22:46] where there's no sin
[22:48] go to a place where you can you can let
[22:51] your guard down
[22:52] and you can be yourself
[22:54] and you can experience god just you go
[22:56] to that place and then i'll tell you how
[22:58] camp was
[22:59] you know i didn't have to look away i
[23:01] didn't have to fight any anything i
[23:03] could just go there and have peace on
[23:05] earth
[23:06] it was amazing so i had an awesome camp
[23:09] thank you
[23:10] it was amazing thank god um
[23:13] so reuben so liam prays for protection
[23:17] um the afternoon at lunch now it sticks
[23:20] because course things that you pray we
[23:22] don't pray for no reason the words come
[23:24] the inspiration comes and why you say it
[23:26] is because it needs to be said it's a
[23:28] spoken word
[23:30] so when liam prayed for protection
[23:32] when we were at lunch because we quickly
[23:34] went in had lunch and came back
[23:36] i kinda it just struck me it's like why
[23:38] would he pray for protection we're not
[23:40] doing we didn't have the chainsaws going
[23:41] we were actually just raking and
[23:43] shoveling and doing stuff like that
[23:44] there was no
[23:45] real danger but and it felt like why
[23:48] would you pray for protection so when we
[23:50] went back i said to ruben go get the axe
[23:51] we needed to chop this tree down it was
[23:53] just a stump about well that high but
[23:55] about this high enough from from here
[23:58] and i was hitting at the base of it and
[24:00] reuben was packing rocks about a meter
[24:02] away from me
[24:03] and i was hitting just at the base and i
[24:05] thought oh it's controlled because i'm
[24:06] just heating down i just want to chop it
[24:07] in such a way that goes halfway so i can
[24:09] push it over you know
[24:11] and i went and and you know as as a man
[24:13] you thought okay i'm just going to give
[24:14] you that one
[24:15] you know just give it a good one and
[24:17] she'll go and as i went down to hit it
[24:19] it slipped and it bounced off and it
[24:21] went straight to his head and stopped
[24:24] now i'm swinging it so you know how much
[24:25] effort you put in and it just stopped
[24:28] and as it stopped i looked at reuben i
[24:29] said praise the lord that your brother
[24:31] just prayed for protection because then
[24:34] the first thought that came back was
[24:35] protection and why did liam pray for it
[24:38] and then i testified i said you know
[24:40] that should have hit you
[24:41] right in your head
[24:43] because i know how much force i put in i
[24:44] said and so we might not have seen why
[24:47] liam prayed for protection but this is
[24:49] that
[24:50] this is that we prayed for and he stood
[24:52] up like the woman at the well run
[24:53] straight on we went to told his mom and
[24:55] testified
[24:56] little things
[24:58] but little things matter amen so praise
[25:00] the lord i didn't hurt my child he
[25:03] protected him and if your children pray
[25:05] for something listen to what they pray
[25:07] for as well
[25:09] amen
[25:12] [Applause]
[25:22] um okay so um
[25:25] on the
[25:26] saturday night i was praying because um
[25:29] i couldn't go outside because i puked in
[25:30] the service and i'd go back to my cabin
[25:33] and so i was like it was like really
[25:35] sick and stuff so i had to go to the
[25:37] cabin and i was praying that the lord
[25:39] would give me the holy ghost the next
[25:40] day on sunday and then
[25:42] as i was praying and then in the service
[25:44] when sister christine just started
[25:46] speaking in tongues like the holy ghost
[25:48] just came down like filled me and i just
[25:50] couldn't stop screaming
[25:52] [Applause]
[26:06] i think for me me and edward was talking
[26:08] last night and i think it's
[26:11] there wasn't one specific moment but it
[26:14] was the whole camp
[26:15] every from start to finish was
[26:17] absolutely just
[26:19] just amazing and like
[26:21] exactly what on once said it felt like
[26:23] we were
[26:24] i had heaven on earth over the weekend
[26:27] everything
[26:28] all the world everything that was
[26:30] bothering everything that is
[26:32] was just gone it was just heavenly and
[26:36] i realized that in such a big sense when
[26:40] tuesday when
[26:42] when we got home and you know you're
[26:44] back to normality and you're back to
[26:46] the world and you're back to all of this
[26:47] it's just like ah i don't want to be
[26:49] here
[26:50] i just want to go home and just said
[26:52] lord just just come just come and and
[26:55] and take us home so yeah the whole thing
[26:57] the whole camp was just absolutely
[27:00] amazing so praise the lord
[27:05] i get a feeling that the bride wants to
[27:06] leave
[27:10] i do
[27:16] hey guys
[27:18] i'm just going to give a bit of a
[27:19] background to my testimony so
[27:21] on the thursday or the wednesday before
[27:24] before going to camp
[27:26] i was really scared because you know a
[27:28] whole entire vaccine thing and all that
[27:29] and i was like i'm going to lose my job
[27:31] because i don't want to get a vaccine i
[27:32] was just really frustrated right and i
[27:34] was a little bit terrified and i was
[27:35] like oh if i'm not a christian and like
[27:37] the tribulation comes and like
[27:39] everything will go wrong for me i'll be
[27:40] stuck here everybody else is in a
[27:41] rapture and i was really questioning
[27:43] that and i was like scared terrified and
[27:45] then i went to camp and on the friday i
[27:47] don't know if anybody saw me but i was
[27:49] in the back like the very back
[27:52] and somebody
[27:54] i got pretty bad so like halfway through
[27:55] the seven
[27:56] brother kubian came and handed me the
[27:58] box of tissues could i because i would
[27:59] like go back and forth because i was
[28:01] crying crying because everything that
[28:03] they said on friday night it really hit
[28:05] me you know it was good it was really
[28:07] good and it was like talking about don't
[28:08] be afraid you know take your time
[28:10] everything's okay
[28:11] so i just want to thank the lord for
[28:12] that that was pretty cool
[28:16] amen
[28:17] hallelujah
[28:36] god bless your sins
[28:38] just a small testimony that
[28:41] you know sometimes we pray
[28:44] and
[28:45] we we do expect the lord to answer our
[28:47] prayers
[28:50] but maybe not in a way that he answers
[28:52] prayers
[28:54] so i was sitting there praying that lord
[28:57] when i go big may i not be the same as
[29:01] when i came
[29:03] but you don't necessarily highlight the
[29:06] areas where you want to be an overcomer
[29:08] and he knew exactly where i needed to
[29:11] overcome
[29:12] so as we were praying sunday night and
[29:14] then he would point this one out and say
[29:16] okay on this area you need to fix this
[29:18] then i'll pray for that area then he
[29:20] said okay this one as well
[29:22] and then when i think i'm done he's like
[29:23] no no this area as well and then i was
[29:26] like oh okay so
[29:28] i asked you that i need to go back now
[29:30] the same way that i came in
[29:32] and i let go i did not say
[29:35] one two three i let it go i i left it
[29:38] with him and then he's the one who knew
[29:41] where things needed to get fixed and
[29:43] then he helped me and said this this
[29:45] this this you need to fix all of this
[29:47] when at the very end when you think
[29:48] you're done he comes and says no no you
[29:50] forgot this one as well
[29:52] then when i came out i knew that i was
[29:54] not the same as when i went
[29:58] [Applause]
[30:14] always good to sneak up on this brother
[30:15] isn't it
[30:17] amen
[30:18] um
[30:19] you know it's awesome i just like to
[30:22] just
[30:24] give the highest acolytes through our
[30:25] tech group
[30:27] amen
[30:28] they did a marvelous job
[30:32] there was there was earthquakes
[30:33] happening on that day
[30:35] and
[30:36] it was so good but you know the tech
[30:38] team makes you sound really good
[30:41] hey isaac
[30:43] [Music]
[30:46] and he did really well too
[30:48] amen
[30:51] yeah that was an icebreaker
[30:53] friday night was a awesome icebreaker
[30:56] you know our brother got up and he
[30:58] preached his heart out he stamped down
[31:00] that devil he threw it out of everybody
[31:04] and he caused that earthquake to shake
[31:06] the very church
[31:08] and it was like joseph you know he had
[31:10] to bring forth that extra fruit
[31:13] and when he brought the icebreaker
[31:15] through
[31:16] then the next icebreaker was
[31:18] isaac asking my wife to come up and sing
[31:21] a song
[31:22] and she did not want an icebreaker again
[31:27] but you know
[31:28] out of all that
[31:30] i think as a team
[31:32] as saints and brothers and sisters in
[31:34] christ
[31:35] we really united together
[31:38] we really did
[31:40] and the icing on the cake
[31:42] was not the last preacher
[31:44] the icing on the cake
[31:46] when our preacher
[31:48] was crying out from his heart
[31:52] come home
[31:53] come home
[31:55] come home
[31:56] that really hit
[31:58] i believe that really stirred up the
[32:00] gift of the holy spirit
[32:02] was coming through our pastor
[32:04] crying out
[32:06] crying out
[32:09] you know
[32:11] such a wonderful time
[32:13] a bless you all
[32:16] [Applause]
[32:39] good morning saints good morning i don't
[32:41] think anyone wants so much the
[32:42] opportunity to thank our lord for what
[32:45] he's done for us
[32:46] the fact that we are here
[32:48] and he's called us by name
[32:50] andy
[32:51] ben marion
[32:53] you know sister k
[32:54] each one of us for a reason
[32:58] camp was wonderful
[33:02] from day one from the time we got there
[33:04] from the time we start setting up and
[33:05] doing all those things
[33:07] you know the lord has got a hand in
[33:09] everything that we're doing
[33:11] for timing
[33:12] whether we're under pressure or we think
[33:14] we're under pressure it's for a reason
[33:18] everything worked in unison
[33:21] he used every gift
[33:23] from the youngest in the
[33:26] in the
[33:27] feeding hall in the dining hall for
[33:29] preparation
[33:30] to the teenagers or the middle-aged guys
[33:33] to clean up and wash up the dishes
[33:36] to us older guys
[33:37] in the kitchen
[33:38] in around everything that we're doing he
[33:41] used every gift
[33:43] for his glory
[33:45] whether you have to wake up early in the
[33:46] morning or you had to go to bed late in
[33:48] the night because you were sharing with
[33:50] someone or just enjoying the fellowship
[33:54] it was for a reason
[33:56] yes as brother andy said we have camp
[33:59] and we love having camp because we get
[34:01] to fellowship with brothers and sisters
[34:03] we missed you brother
[34:04] we were hoping that you were there
[34:06] uh but your family stood and and took
[34:08] your your place
[34:10] amen
[34:11] we we want everyone to come together
[34:13] when it's camp yes
[34:15] we're going through this trial at this
[34:16] moment with this with this this epidemic
[34:18] that's out there but
[34:20] he gathered a few
[34:22] saints just a small number
[34:25] but still we had a victorious time
[34:29] better than the last one
[34:31] you know if we can just see that
[34:34] and if that was just
[34:36] you guys
[34:37] how much more is going to do when we all
[34:40] get together when all the saints get
[34:42] together from the north to the south to
[34:44] east and the west we all come together

[41:34] my dad's heart to pray for the neighbors
[41:36] that day we saw the rescue helicopter

[41:41] um at school we found out this um that
[41:45] this older person
[41:47] nearly got kicked um he was chasing the
[41:50] cow to get back in and then he was gonna
[41:52] grab the cow and push it and then he
[41:54] forgot that a cliff was behind him and
[41:56] then he fell off the cliff and
[41:59] that
[42:00] um same day no the next day after that a
[42:04] boy got hit by a car when he was
[42:05] crossing the road
[42:07] and like it was just a testimony that

[53:46] we're going to go to romans chapter
[53:47] eight
[53:49] amen trust everyone's well
[53:51] and um
[53:53] as everyone's been saying you know the
[53:55] same god at camp is the same god here
[53:58] he's not confined thank the lord to
[54:00] forest lakes campground
[54:02] right so and he wants to prove himself
[54:05] the same
[54:06] here now and in our everyday life and
[54:08] we'll go into that a bit later but so
[54:11] second kings 13 and 20
[54:15] verses 20 and 21 it says here
[54:18] and elisha died
[54:20] and they buried him
[54:22] and the band of the moabites invaded the
[54:24] land at the coming in of the year and it
[54:27] came to pass as they were burying a man
[54:29] that behold they spied a band of men and
[54:32] they cast the man into the sepulchre of
[54:34] elisha and when the man was let down and
[54:36] touched the bones of elisha he revived
[54:39] and stood on his feet
[54:41] and we're going to go to romans 8 and
[54:43] verse 10. this may seem a bit
[54:45] i trust we'll you know you'll see the
[54:47] context of of this
[54:49] romans 8 and 10.
[54:57] am in romans 8 10 and 11
[55:01] it says
[55:04] and if christ be in you
[55:06] the body is dead because of sin but the
[55:08] spirit is life because of righteousness
[55:11] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[55:13] jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[55:15] raised up christ from the dead shall
[55:17] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[55:20] spirit that dwelleth in you

[57:24] real with them as well granted father
[57:26] may your word become alive in every life
[57:28] in jesus christ's name amen
[57:31] amen god bless your friends you may have
[57:32] your seats this morning i want to speak
[57:34] about the bride's last miracle
[57:37] and um but before we do that i just want
[57:39] to read you know because the devil uh
[57:42] the devil's crafty but he's um
[57:45] he thinks that god is only god in
[57:48] certain places
[57:49] now when when when syria would come
[57:52] against israel
[57:53] the uh this is in first kings and and in
[57:56] chapter 20 you don't need to turn into
[57:57] it i just want to refer to it because
[57:59] sometimes the devil thinks well god is
[58:01] only powerful in certain places so what
[58:03] he tries to do is he tries to put your
[58:05] experience at campus that's just a camp
[58:07] experience but you know god wants to
[58:10] prove to you that he's god everywhere
[58:12] in every situation he's god so the
[58:14] assyrians came against israel and they
[58:17] said well let's fight them in the hills
[58:18] they fought israel in the hills they got
[58:20] massacred then they came back a bit
[58:22] later and said well their gods are the
[58:24] gods of the hill so we'll fight them in
[58:25] the plane but then they got massacred in
[58:27] the plane and that proves that god is
[58:29] not only god of the hills or the
[58:31] mountaintop but he's god on the plane i
[58:34] mean so he's not just god on the hills
[58:35] but he's god on the plane in everyday
[58:37] life i mean so he's not confined to a
[58:40] certain place or a certain certain
[58:42] situation he's the same god
[58:44] i mean so the enemy wants to make us
[58:46] think that he's only strong in certain
[58:48] places but he said he'd never leave us
[58:50] nor forsake us right he's the same
[58:52] yesterday today and forever amen but he
[58:54] needs he wants to prove that to you you
[58:57] know jesus defeated the devil with the
[58:58] word in the desert amen
[59:01] after a 40-day fast
[59:03] right so proving to us the prophet said
[59:05] that that any believer even who would
[59:07] consider themselves the weakest of
[59:09] christians can take the word of god and
[59:12] defeat satan any place anytime anywhere
[59:15] amen the apostle paul would find out
[59:17] that god is god in every place
[59:20] not just on the road to damascus but in
[59:22] damascus amen in the jail with paul and
[59:25] silas he was god amen in the storm in a
[59:28] shipwreck he was gone i mean collecting
[59:31] collecting wood being bitten by an adder
[59:32] he was god and the reason the apostle
[59:34] paul none of these things moved him is
[59:36] because he had a revelation in his heart
[59:38] he had to go to rome
[59:40] and nothing could stop him going there
[59:42] and being a living witness because that
[59:45] was a revelation to him he's going to
[59:47] roam
[59:48] so the storm couldn't kill him because
[59:50] he had to go to rome the the the ass
[59:53] couldn't kill him because he had to go
[59:54] to rome now we're going to realize we're
[59:56] on our way to a place and it's not to
[59:58] rome it's to heaven right so we're going
[1:00:00] to realize nothing can if you just yo i
[1:00:02] trust is so anchored in your souls i
[1:00:04] mean nothing can take me off this path
[1:00:06] the devil will try and push you off the
[1:00:08] path but if there's divine revelation in
[1:00:10] your heart it doesn't matter i mean what
[1:00:13] situation you go into i mean you go
[1:00:15] through it
[1:00:16] but god wants to prove to you he's the
[1:00:19] same god everywhere and he also wants to
[1:00:21] prove to you who you are
[1:00:23] it's like when abraham was there god
[1:00:26] revealed himself to abraham but he had
[1:00:28] to reveal to abraham who abraham was
[1:00:30] right that he was the father of faith
[1:00:32] that he could stagger not at the promise
[1:00:33] of god but give god praise being fully
[1:00:35] persuaded that he could do that which he
[1:00:37] had promised right so he had but he had
[1:00:39] to show abraham that it's the same thing
[1:00:41] with this message with the lord i mean
[1:00:43] he wants to prove to you who you are
[1:00:46] hallelujah so
[1:00:48] never ever let it be a uh oh it's just
[1:00:51] camp
[1:00:52] he's the same god in everyday life
[1:00:55] i mean i got the holy ghost washing
[1:00:56] dishes
[1:00:59] at work
[1:01:01] this is back at university hey the lord
[1:01:03] was dealing with me the word came alive
[1:01:04] the bible became a new book but he just
[1:01:06] anchored his love in my heart
[1:01:08] and i realized how much he loved me and
[1:01:10] how much i loved him and the bible says
[1:01:12] in romans 5 5 that we are not ashamed
[1:01:15] because the love of god has shed abroad
[1:01:16] in our hearts by the holy ghost which is
[1:01:17] given unto us so i had an ex a
[1:01:19] life-changing experience with god
[1:01:21] washing dishes
[1:01:23] amen so god will meet you in the
[1:01:24] everyday life
[1:01:26] so we've got to realize god is not just
[1:01:28] god of camp he's god everywhere
[1:01:30] amen and he wants to prove that to us
[1:01:33] now elisha we read here uh brother
[1:01:36] braham tells us that elisha types the
[1:01:38] believer types the bride
[1:01:40] and elisha he was just living his
[1:01:42] everyday life but then god had already
[1:01:45] told elijah which represents christ the
[1:01:48] word to go anoint elisha
[1:01:50] and then so allah um elisha is just
[1:01:53] plowing with his oxen and then elijah
[1:01:55] comes along and just cast his mantle
[1:01:57] upon him and the prophet says that that
[1:02:00] elisha had to be cut or had to be
[1:02:02] changed to fit elijah's mantle he was
[1:02:04] ordained to wear the mantle but he had
[1:02:06] to be shaped and had to be molded that
[1:02:08] the mantle would eventually fit him
[1:02:10] i mean but then so elisha what he did is
[1:02:12] he as he just said to elijah can i just
[1:02:14] you know basically burn every bridge and
[1:02:16] i'll come follow you because he killed
[1:02:18] his ox and he he he cooked it up and the
[1:02:20] harness everything fed it to his family
[1:02:22] he burned every bridge and he said i'm
[1:02:24] gonna walk with god i'm gonna and it's
[1:02:26] the same thing with you and i i trust
[1:02:28] you've got nothing to go back to you've
[1:02:30] got no formal religion you've got no
[1:02:32] custom you've got no world whatever it
[1:02:34] is it's dead
[1:02:36] hallelujah you cooked it up you send it
[1:02:39] away
[1:02:40] praise the lord i mean so now elijah i
[1:02:43] mean elisha now if i get these ones
[1:02:44] mixed up i'm sure you've come to a place
[1:02:47] where you realize take what i say no
[1:02:48] take what i mean and not what i say
[1:02:50] because i get these things you know
[1:02:52] vice versa anyway
[1:02:54] so as elisha was following elijah he was
[1:02:59] being shaped and molded i mean to fit
[1:03:02] elijah's mantle
[1:03:04] now here then he comes to a place where
[1:03:06] where it's revealed now that elijah's
[1:03:09] going to go up into glory
[1:03:11] and then even elijah tries to tell
[1:03:13] elijah to stop following him he would
[1:03:16] say in second kings two he says you know
[1:03:18] carry here and gilgal
[1:03:21] you know stay here in bethel
[1:03:24] he tries to get him to stop but then
[1:03:26] elijah says to elijah i'm not gonna
[1:03:28] leave thee i'm going
[1:03:30] you know because remember the lord's
[1:03:32] looking for our response are you going
[1:03:34] to stay you're going to continue and i
[1:03:35] just made up my mind i'm continuing on
[1:03:38] wherever this word leads me i'm going
[1:03:41] because the lord knows the future he's
[1:03:42] the god of the future so i'm just going
[1:03:44] to follow this word remember this
[1:03:45] message did not find us god didn't save
[1:03:48] us to lose us
[1:03:50] right he redeemed us to keep us remember
[1:03:52] redemption is to claim back that which
[1:03:54] was lost right so we were lost but we're
[1:03:56] in the back part of god's mind his
[1:03:58] attributes expressed upon the earth and
[1:04:00] god knew that where we were we're part
[1:04:02] of him and he came to find us he can't
[1:04:05] lose one of his children right so he's
[1:04:07] not going to save us or redeem us to
[1:04:09] lose us there's nothing the devil can do
[1:04:11] that can get an attribute of god away
[1:04:14] from god forever either we may stray the
[1:04:16] path we may be a prodigal but eventually
[1:04:18] there comes a season we come home
[1:04:20] right in god's great economy there's a
[1:04:22] season where we come home hallelujah so
[1:04:25] you know because god's not losing one he
[1:04:27] cannot the devil's not going to get one
[1:04:29] of god's children
[1:04:30] hallelujah they're all coming
[1:04:33] amen that's why we've got to believe for
[1:04:35] our families they're part of god
[1:04:39] don't give up on anyone
[1:04:41] amen hallelujah
[1:04:44] so
[1:04:45] elijah
[1:04:46] so elisha was led by the word
[1:04:50] until finally he came to a spot where
[1:04:52] they where where the mantle that your
[1:04:54] elijah took the mantle and he struck
[1:04:57] jordan as his and it separated divided
[1:05:00] hither and thither
[1:05:01] and they went over on dry ground now we
[1:05:03] know jordan you know this this there's
[1:05:05] three places they go to or they start at
[1:05:07] guild gathering they go to bethel they
[1:05:09] go to jericho then they go to jordan and
[1:05:11] brother braham tells us that this is
[1:05:13] this this types the believers walk from
[1:05:15] justification repentance baptism amen
[1:05:18] and sanctification then eventually you
[1:05:20] come to jordan you die to everything
[1:05:22] because jordan represents death
[1:05:24] amen and then you go over to the baptism
[1:05:27] of the holy ghost
[1:05:28] so here they did so so so they crossed
[1:05:31] jordan
[1:05:32] and then a lot but it's amazing because
[1:05:35] there were other people around the sons
[1:05:36] of the prophets and they knew what was
[1:05:38] going to happen but they were just
[1:05:40] spectators you don't just want to be a
[1:05:42] spectator in god's great plan say lord i
[1:05:44] want to be i want to be front and center
[1:05:46] of your word
[1:05:47] amen
[1:05:48] i don't just want to be uh you know
[1:05:51] staging
[1:05:52] i want to play the part of the bride
[1:05:55] amen remember really we god knows who's
[1:05:57] going to be there but really this this
[1:05:59] whole life is an audition what part do
[1:06:01] you want to play
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:04] i don't want to play the villain
[1:06:06] he's already got enough people playing
[1:06:08] that
[1:06:09] i want to play the damsel in distress
[1:06:12] because she goes to safety the wedding
[1:06:14] supper in the sky
[1:06:15] i mean so here he is she i mean here
[1:06:18] here he comes over jordan
[1:06:20] and then elijah's taken up
[1:06:22] and in that same mantle because but but
[1:06:24] before that before that happens he asks
[1:06:26] for a double portion
[1:06:28] i want a double portion and then elijah
[1:06:30] says
[1:06:31] to elisha that's a hard thing but if you
[1:06:33] see me when i leave you'll receive it so
[1:06:35] the mantle fell down after elijah was
[1:06:38] taken up in the chariot
[1:06:40] and then elijah i mean then elisha
[1:06:42] picked up the mantle
[1:06:44] and he came back to jordan and he said
[1:06:46] where is the god of elijah and he struck
[1:06:49] the jordan and it parted exactly as
[1:06:51] elijah did
[1:06:53] hallelujah so now we know that
[1:06:55] uh jordan also represents death
[1:06:58] and i'll just say that right now you've
[1:07:00] got to have the mantle of the baptism of
[1:07:02] the holy ghost the living word in order
[1:07:04] to part death and go into heaven
[1:07:07] you've got to have it in you you've got
[1:07:08] to be carrying it it's not something
[1:07:10] you're you're the prophet says that god
[1:07:11] just doesn't change the spirit within
[1:07:13] you just before you die and you go to
[1:07:14] glory no you've gotta you gotta be ready
[1:07:18] gotta be robbed in his righteousness now
[1:07:21] hallelujah are we dressed today
[1:07:24] amen in the mantle
[1:07:26] of the holy ghost so now elisha
[1:07:30] he asked for a double portion and he did
[1:07:32] twice as many miracles as elijah did
[1:07:36] but to me the last miracle
[1:07:39] was the greatest
[1:07:40] one and that last miracle was the
[1:07:43] resurrection of the dead man
[1:07:45] and that last miracle
[1:07:47] was nothing he consciously did he didn't
[1:07:50] pray
[1:07:51] he didn't he didn't lay hands he didn't
[1:07:53] say there's a need here i've got to go
[1:07:55] here or lord what would you have me do
[1:07:56] there's a life in him
[1:07:59] there's a life in him now we've come
[1:08:01] back to the literal life of christ
[1:08:03] right christ is in his bride this is the
[1:08:06] bright coming of jesus christ right now
[1:08:08] the bride coming of jesus christ that's
[1:08:10] what you know god says i know brother
[1:08:12] braham said that god changes his mask
[1:08:15] right and his last mask to the gentiles
[1:08:17] is you and i god veiled behind skin
[1:08:20] again the great unveiling of god is
[1:08:22] actually veiled in simplicity
[1:08:24] in you and i
[1:08:26] hallelujah so now it's a life so so
[1:08:28] we've been returned back to the literal
[1:08:30] life of christ
[1:08:32] not just gifts not just being justified
[1:08:34] or sanctified but all those
[1:08:36] with the giver
[1:08:38] that's what we have right brother bam
[1:08:40] says deity is not just in heaven it's in
[1:08:42] you
[1:08:43] amen i just say amen
[1:08:45] because remember the holy ghost is not a
[1:08:46] lesser god he's not part of the you know
[1:08:48] he's not a second person or a third
[1:08:50] person or whatever of the person of the
[1:08:52] godhead it is god the one who made sun
[1:08:54] moon and stars comes and dwells in his
[1:08:56] redeemed children
[1:08:57] hallelujah so so it was a life on
[1:09:00] display
[1:09:01] that brought forth a resurrection
[1:09:04] this is where i'm going this is elijah
[1:09:06] you know it seemed to tarry maybe the
[1:09:07] critics would have been watching elisha
[1:09:10] saying oh you said you got a double
[1:09:11] portion
[1:09:12] how many miracles
[1:09:13] what's done god what has god done in
[1:09:16] your life he maybe would recount seven i
[1:09:18] said where's the last one you said you
[1:09:20] had the double portion and then elisha
[1:09:23] gets sick and you know when the devil
[1:09:25] starts fighting that's when the critics
[1:09:26] start barking or chattering
[1:09:29] but just just stay steady with god
[1:09:31] because god remember god vindicates you
[1:09:33] and i god vindicates his word if his
[1:09:35] word is in you you're part of the word
[1:09:36] he'll vindicate you
[1:09:38] it's not us trying to prove this thing
[1:09:40] you know we don't have to prove nothing
[1:09:42] it's god that steps on the scene
[1:09:44] hallelujah and fights the battle if you
[1:09:46] let him hey we can fight a lot of
[1:09:48] battles but every battle i've thought
[1:09:50] i've lost but every battle i've let him
[1:09:52] fight he wins
[1:09:53] i'd rather let him win
[1:09:55] that's a good conclusion no one wants to
[1:09:57] be the loser
[1:09:59] yeah hello okay
[1:10:01] so maybe the critics begin to gather
[1:10:03] around and you know they were counting
[1:10:04] miracles and things says oh
[1:10:07] and then he dies
[1:10:09] i thought he had a double portion
[1:10:11] i thought the bride had the goods some
[1:10:12] people say the bride has the goods
[1:10:14] there's going to be a resurrection
[1:10:17] there's going to be a resurrection
[1:10:18] the dead in christ are going to rise
[1:10:20] first
[1:10:21] hallelujah
[1:10:22] so there's a lingering of this but the
[1:10:24] thing is it wasn't it wasn't up to
[1:10:27] elisha to fulfill it it was the life of
[1:10:30] christ within him that was going to
[1:10:32] fulfill it it's the same thing with you
[1:10:34] and i you say how's the dead in christ
[1:10:35] going to rise there's going to be a life
[1:10:38] on display that's going to call them out
[1:10:40] of the grave
[1:10:43] amen he would say this brother brown
[1:10:45] would say this and and it is the rising
[1:10:47] of the sun
[1:10:48] he's so speaking about the resurrection
[1:10:50] morning brother kabin was saying this is
[1:10:52] resurrection morning that's why we have
[1:10:53] church on a sunday morning because to
[1:10:55] honor the resurrection
[1:10:57] hallelujah he says and the first light
[1:10:59] that was ever given in the earth was
[1:11:01] god's spoken word the first light that
[1:11:04] ever struck the earth was god's spoken
[1:11:06] word he said let there be light and
[1:11:07] there was light that turned darkness
[1:11:10] into light in order to bring forth a
[1:11:12] creation of joy and life upon the earth
[1:11:15] then the spirit of god as it moved with
[1:11:18] love and compassion at that great day
[1:11:20] the first day of the dawn of the
[1:11:22] creation upon the earth the sun rose and
[1:11:24] swept across its rays and dried up the
[1:11:27] waters from the earth
[1:11:28] and made an atmosphere above
[1:11:31] and for its first time it was to bring
[1:11:33] joy and life to the earth by a seed that
[1:11:37] was a great hour
[1:11:38] but oh it wasn't nothing that sunrise
[1:11:41] like the sunrise on that easter morning
[1:11:43] this time when the sun leaping into the
[1:11:45] skies it brought forth a greater sunrise
[1:11:48] than ever because it came because it
[1:11:51] came greater news with this sunrise than
[1:11:54] it did the sunrise at the beginning
[1:11:57] this sunrise brought forth the news he
[1:11:59] has risen he is quickened from the dead
[1:12:02] as he promised he's risen from the dead
[1:12:04] the first time the sun rose in genesis
[1:12:06] it was bringing a message that there
[1:12:08] will be life upon the earth mortal life
[1:12:12] but this time when the sun rose there
[1:12:14] was a dual sun rising another sun rising
[1:12:17] it was not only the s-u-n rising it was
[1:12:20] the s-o-n had risen to bring eternal
[1:12:23] life to all god's promised seed by that
[1:12:27] by four knowledge that he had seen
[1:12:28] laying upon the earth
[1:12:30] hello because we know if you read the
[1:12:32] account of genesis it doesn't say that
[1:12:34] he created the seeds they're already in
[1:12:36] the earth but they're waiting for god to
[1:12:38] brood upon the face of the deep and the
[1:12:40] waters to be part of the sun to shine
[1:12:42] it's the same thing with you because
[1:12:44] your seed in the earth that had to come
[1:12:45] forth it's the same thing with you and i
[1:12:47] there's a seed of predestination and it
[1:12:50] may have been carried
[1:12:51] covered in a lot of darkness our first
[1:12:53] birth brought a lot of darkness over the
[1:12:55] sea
[1:12:56] hallelujah but then god but god began to
[1:12:58] brood over your life because he knew
[1:13:00] there was a seed in there that had to
[1:13:02] come forth i mean he wasn't just
[1:13:04] satisfied with your first birth being
[1:13:06] manifested there's a greater seed than
[1:13:08] your natural seed that you were born by
[1:13:10] there's eternal life in you that had to
[1:13:12] come forth so you begin to brood
[1:13:15] i was just like a
[1:13:16] elijah throwing the mantle over elisha
[1:13:18] there's a seed in him
[1:13:21] hallelujah there's a seed in him that
[1:13:22] had to come forth
[1:13:24] hallelujah
[1:13:26] amen
[1:13:27] no more could the botany life lived back
[1:13:30] there at the beginning without the s-u-n
[1:13:32] to bring it to life no more than today
[1:13:35] when sons of god is upon the earth it
[1:13:38] takes the s-o-n light to bring them to
[1:13:40] eternal life
[1:13:42] amen he
[1:13:43] has chosen ones that he knew before the
[1:13:45] foundation of the world he had chosen
[1:13:48] them in himself before the foundation of
[1:13:50] the world
[1:13:52] hallelujah and on easter morning when in
[1:13:54] this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at
[1:13:56] that time for we are the dust of the
[1:13:58] earth and in heaven there is a book of
[1:14:00] memory and his attributes was in him
[1:14:03] knowing that because this son of god
[1:14:05] raised it would also raise to life every
[1:14:08] sun that was ordained to this great time
[1:14:12] he knew it would be and what a glorious
[1:14:14] sunrise that was than it was in the
[1:14:17] beginning at the time when it first
[1:14:19] dawned he says oh he says now on this
[1:14:22] breaking of the easter seal
[1:14:25] to me that's more poetry i mean it's
[1:14:26] more than poetry it's making a
[1:14:28] declaration i mean the son has risen
[1:14:31] this is the greatest sunrise hallelujah
[1:14:34] and he said it bring life to every
[1:14:36] foreordained son or daughter of god
[1:14:39] that's why we should rejoice but the
[1:14:41] thing is the devil tries to rob us
[1:14:42] saying oh you didn't feel anything no
[1:14:44] you believe it that he brings the
[1:14:45] feeling
[1:14:46] right because god wants to prove himself
[1:14:48] if you feel as dead as a post do you
[1:14:50] still believe
[1:14:52] hallelujah sure these feelings come i
[1:14:54] mean we we believe in heartfelt religion
[1:14:56] that we're not a morgue
[1:14:58] this is living living voices living
[1:15:01] people
[1:15:02] hallelujah
[1:15:03] amen but the thing is we can't you know
[1:15:06] just believe just take god at his word
[1:15:08] and he will bring it to pass in your
[1:15:09] life
[1:15:10] but if there's just a tug in your heart
[1:15:12] for god i want to make my life right
[1:15:14] it's not like that that's god pulling
[1:15:15] you because he wants to bring to bring
[1:15:17] to life something in you
[1:15:18] hallelujah of that seed
[1:15:22] amen so it was so it would raise to life
[1:15:25] every sun that was foreign to this great
[1:15:28] time what's this great time a rapture
[1:15:31] i'm talking about this great time what's
[1:15:32] this great time a wedding supper in the
[1:15:34] sky we're about to go to what's this
[1:15:36] great time a union amen between christ
[1:15:38] and his bride which we are enjoying
[1:15:41] right now
[1:15:43] hallelujah i'm so thankful that we don't
[1:15:45] just become a good moral people
[1:15:48] i mean this is not a reformation sure i
[1:15:51] said happy reformation day but we're
[1:15:53] we're you know it started there but
[1:15:55] didn't end in a reformation i mean we
[1:15:57] have been totally loosed
[1:15:59] from the systems of the devil we've been
[1:16:01] turning loose from all of his clutches
[1:16:03] from unbelief he has no claim on the
[1:16:05] bride of christ whatsoever i mean if the
[1:16:08] devil if you have the devil still trying
[1:16:10] to accuse you've got to recognize that
[1:16:11] the blood of jesus christ has so
[1:16:13] cleansed have you accepted that blood
[1:16:15] the power of the blood breaks every hole
[1:16:18] hallelujah and it's not just us putting
[1:16:20] away our first our first union with the
[1:16:22] devil because brother ram says that our
[1:16:24] first husband was actually satan the
[1:16:26] devil by our first birth it's not just
[1:16:28] putting him away in a closet for maybe
[1:16:30] when things get bad i'll turn back to
[1:16:32] the world no that nature's got to die
[1:16:34] he's got to die i mean if you think
[1:16:37] anything that you used to do in the
[1:16:38] world and you have a positive thought
[1:16:40] about it it's got to die
[1:16:43] because that's still part of your
[1:16:44] identity it's got to die
[1:16:47] all i'm thankful about is i'm not in
[1:16:50] that anymore i'm so glad i'm not back in
[1:16:52] that cage of unbelief and sin i've been
[1:16:55] loosed
[1:16:56] hallelujah
[1:16:58] amen
[1:17:00] so i'm so glad we're not just a a
[1:17:02] reformed people
[1:17:04] trying to live the word of god in our
[1:17:06] own strength
[1:17:08] but god's quickening power quickens us
[1:17:10] to the word
[1:17:12] that he becomes the christian within us
[1:17:15] bam says in investments he says and that
[1:17:19] he says and that was that's been so
[1:17:20] twisted that they brought it over into
[1:17:22] christianity just a form just to say
[1:17:24] that we should make a declaration of
[1:17:26] creeds or laws by laws of christianity
[1:17:29] and we have been very able with
[1:17:31] intellectual beings to present this to
[1:17:33] the world but you see we don't find them
[1:17:37] taking it like they should because it
[1:17:39] hasn't got life in it
[1:17:41] see we must find something every man is
[1:17:43] looking past the curtain from that
[1:17:45] somewhere beyond that he come from and
[1:17:48] knows he's got to return someday
[1:17:50] everybody wants to see it wants to know
[1:17:52] what is beyond that speaking about the
[1:17:54] life the next life
[1:17:56] this is a very beautiful picture jesus
[1:17:58] said when the unclean spirit has gone
[1:18:00] out of a man did you notice he never
[1:18:02] said when he's cast out of a man but
[1:18:04] when he goes out by his own will when
[1:18:06] the unclean spirit has gone out of a man
[1:18:08] and returns back to this man and finds
[1:18:10] that the house that he lived in has been
[1:18:12] swept garnished then he goes and gets
[1:18:14] seven other devils demons unclean
[1:18:16] spirits and enters into this man and the
[1:18:19] last estate of this man is seven times
[1:18:21] worse than it was at the first did you
[1:18:23] notice the devil went out by his own
[1:18:25] will and he returned by his own will now
[1:18:27] if this house has
[1:18:29] been uh has already been occupied when
[1:18:32] he returned he would not be able to get
[1:18:34] in but you see he found it swept and
[1:18:36] garnished it's a very beautiful picture
[1:18:39] of a moralist
[1:18:40] so we think of men today tries to think
[1:18:43] he's going to heaven just because he
[1:18:45] quit gambling or maybe he quit running
[1:18:48] with the woman that wasn't his wife or
[1:18:50] stopped us drinking on new year's day
[1:18:52] and turned over a new leaf and joined
[1:18:54] church see
[1:18:55] he isn't really converted he's just a
[1:18:57] moralist we don't want to be a moral
[1:18:58] estate
[1:19:00] the devil using moralists to go out and
[1:19:03] make a fullest representation
[1:19:06] when really the real power of the living
[1:19:08] christ isn't there
[1:19:10] the world is wanting to see christ jesus
[1:19:12] said i am the vine and ye are the
[1:19:14] branches and the branch bears the record
[1:19:16] of the vine because it draws us energy
[1:19:18] and life from the vine while the first
[1:19:20] vine first branch that came from this
[1:19:22] vine they wrote a book of acts behind
[1:19:24] that branch we see the way the holy
[1:19:26] spirit acted in that first church that
[1:19:28] church of pentecost when we believe that
[1:19:31] if it's this original vine never puts
[1:19:33] forth another branch it'll write another
[1:19:35] book of acts behind it because of the
[1:19:37] same life that's in the vine
[1:19:39] hallelujah because remember in that book
[1:19:41] of acts church there was a space of time
[1:19:43] before the church age fell became the
[1:19:45] ephesian age
[1:19:46] amen and we've been restored to that
[1:19:49] not the ephesian age of just aiming at
[1:19:51] and relaxing
[1:19:52] right but actually not but aiming it and
[1:19:54] becoming
[1:19:56] i mean so aiming it and becoming the
[1:19:57] word
[1:19:58] hallelujah
[1:20:00] amen we don't want to be a bunch of
[1:20:02] moralists see see the world is looking
[1:20:04] for christ now elisha
[1:20:06] when he crossed jordan he had the
[1:20:08] mantle of elijah
[1:20:10] so that same god that was with elijah
[1:20:12] was now with elisha it wasn't a
[1:20:14] different god it wasn't a different
[1:20:16] mantle it was the same life
[1:20:18] amen manifesting
[1:20:20] in the same way
[1:20:21] same god
[1:20:23] hallelujah as the same thing with you
[1:20:25] and i we don't have a different god
[1:20:28] this may be very elementary but we don't
[1:20:30] have a different god we can't i trust
[1:20:32] when we read the book of acts we say i
[1:20:34] can see me in the book of acts because
[1:20:36] the acts of the holy spirit and the
[1:20:37] apostles should be the same holy ghost
[1:20:39] and you and i amen
[1:20:41] hallelujah
[1:20:43] amen that's that's how we should be
[1:20:46] hallelujah now we're living in an hour
[1:20:50] where god is manifesting his full power
[1:20:53] that rhymes but i didn't mean it to
[1:20:55] rhyme but this is the hour where it's
[1:20:57] not just a professor of the word so
[1:20:59] claiming things
[1:21:01] even though we need to do that because
[1:21:02] he's the high priest of our profession
[1:21:03] but it's those who possess the promise
[1:21:06] right we are possessors of eternal life
[1:21:08] we are possessors of every divine
[1:21:10] promise you know brother brahm says the
[1:21:12] quickening power quickens you to every
[1:21:13] promise in the world
[1:21:15] hallelujah do we have that now i mean
[1:21:17] it's not something we'll get one day we
[1:21:19] have it right now in your possession if
[1:21:21] you've been quick and this message
[1:21:22] become alive to you you seen a living
[1:21:24] god living your life like you've been
[1:21:25] quick into the word of your age i mean
[1:21:27] not to a different word not to a church
[1:21:29] but to the living word of the age where
[1:21:31] you become now a living bible
[1:21:34] remember many people will never read a
[1:21:36] bible but they'll read your life
[1:21:39] and and really what needs to happen and
[1:21:41] i trust you can see it is that the
[1:21:43] character of christ the revelation of
[1:21:44] jesus christ it's a nature it's a
[1:21:46] character of a person
[1:21:48] right
[1:21:49] that character by the holy ghost comes
[1:21:51] into you
[1:21:53] amen so when people read your life they
[1:21:55] should see jesus they may not recognize
[1:21:58] who he is
[1:21:59] but they should be able to see there's
[1:22:01] something different about those people
[1:22:03] more than how they dress more than the
[1:22:04] things they don't do
[1:22:06] but a character
[1:22:08] a life remember it's a life on display
[1:22:10] elisha had quickening power in his bones
[1:22:13] he was just living life
[1:22:15] he was anointed by elijah
[1:22:18] but he had quickening power
[1:22:20] and it was the life within him that
[1:22:22] brought forth a resurrection
[1:22:25] now brother braham says this here i
[1:22:27] believe it's in looking unto jesus he
[1:22:28] says now mechanics
[1:22:31] ain't what runs the automobile
[1:22:33] it's the dynamics that runs it
[1:22:36] amen it the mechanics don't run the
[1:22:39] church it's the dynamics
[1:22:42] the holy ghost that gets into this word
[1:22:44] it's not a seminary that teaches you all
[1:22:46] the theology and the greek
[1:22:47] interpretations but it's the dynamics of
[1:22:50] the holy ghost in there to set that a
[1:22:52] fire and bring it to pass and to make it
[1:22:55] live just exactly what the promised word
[1:22:57] is for this hour
[1:22:59] what is the promise for this hour
[1:23:01] that a people will become built into the
[1:23:03] image of jesus christ will be built to
[1:23:05] the fullness of the statue of the
[1:23:06] perfect man
[1:23:08] that's the promise of the this hour and
[1:23:10] then when jesus when the lord sees
[1:23:12] himself reflected in his bride remember
[1:23:13] the prophet said she is him
[1:23:16] we become so much the word that when he
[1:23:18] sees us he doesn't see our peculiarities
[1:23:21] of our humanity he sees himself
[1:23:23] displayed in a people
[1:23:26] hallelujah
[1:23:27] amen so that's that is the promise of
[1:23:29] the hour that he sees himself manifested
[1:23:32] in a people
[1:23:34] hallelujah
[1:23:35] now
[1:23:38] not the mechanics the dynamics it takes
[1:23:40] the mechanics and the dynamics the word
[1:23:42] and the spirit they are the one that
[1:23:45] gives life what god promised for this
[1:23:47] hour look for it to be fulfilled you
[1:23:49] must look to him because he is the word
[1:23:51] and the only way you can look to the
[1:23:53] word is look to him look to him he is
[1:23:55] the word and the word promised for this
[1:23:57] day is to be fulfilled this day noah's
[1:23:59] time could not be fulfilled this day it
[1:24:01] was only a type moses time and so forth
[1:24:04] but this is the day that god has
[1:24:07] promised these things that we're now
[1:24:08] enjoying these things that we're now
[1:24:11] seeing and the world is laughing at this
[1:24:13] great monumentous power of the holy
[1:24:16] ghost that can change a sinner's heart
[1:24:17] they can take a lukewarm church member
[1:24:19] and give him a testimony that will set
[1:24:22] the church of fire from where he came
[1:24:24] out of as a dynamic that got into the
[1:24:26] word
[1:24:27] what did we see at camp
[1:24:29] it was the it was the former ladder rain
[1:24:31] running together
[1:24:33] there's a teaching then the quickening
[1:24:35] that's what we saw
[1:24:37] there's a dynamic power the holy ghost
[1:24:39] being poured out
[1:24:40] hallelujah that's the season we're in
[1:24:43] we're not looking for it it's here
[1:24:44] oh people are looking for a great move
[1:24:46] of god it's here are we oh we need the
[1:24:48] bride's revival it's been going on we
[1:24:50] need to recognize it's been going what's
[1:24:52] the awakening of the bride
[1:24:54] hallelujah we did yes like the welsh
[1:24:56] revival the people from america went
[1:24:57] over to wales and they're trying to find
[1:24:59] the welsh revival maybe they're trying
[1:25:00] to find a big church or whatever and
[1:25:02] they see a policeman whirling is batting
[1:25:05] around and whistling i'm so glad i can
[1:25:07] sign one of them or whatever he's
[1:25:08] singing and you know and they asked him
[1:25:10] good sir we're looking for the welsh
[1:25:11] revival and he says well you've arrived
[1:25:14] it's in me i am the welsh revival highly
[1:25:17] the life he was living aiming because
[1:25:18] god was so alive to him the word became
[1:25:21] alive to him he realized i am the welsh
[1:25:23] revival
[1:25:24] hallelujah and we're going to realize
[1:25:26] actually we are the bride's revival
[1:25:28] where's the revival going on is it here
[1:25:30] no it's in here
[1:25:32] hallelujah amen
[1:25:34] amen
[1:25:35] he says and what shall i do with jesus
[1:25:37] called christ
[1:25:39] he says let me say something
[1:25:41] to this uniting time we're in a uniting
[1:25:43] time aren't we christian is broadly
[1:25:45] uniting to see churches uniting nations
[1:25:48] uniting its unite it's uniting time of
[1:25:51] god and his bride too
[1:25:53] and i say this with reverence and
[1:25:54] respect i believe that the bride of
[1:25:56] christ is called i believe she's sealed
[1:25:58] in the kingdom of god i believe the
[1:26:00] mechanics is there they're waiting for
[1:26:02] the dynamics it'll take her off the
[1:26:04] earth into glory and the rapture i
[1:26:06] believe with all my heart yes sir we
[1:26:07] don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:26:09] he shall do it he is the dynamics we
[1:26:12] just become members of the machine of
[1:26:14] his body forming ourselves into his
[1:26:16] image and we see his uniting himself
[1:26:18] with us in his works with his love gifts
[1:26:21] as he hands them to us just before the
[1:26:22] wedding supper and we're waiting
[1:26:24] watching for that their big church is to
[1:26:27] be united
[1:26:28] the dynamics of this church
[1:26:30] this is you now
[1:26:32] will be a refilling of the holy spirit
[1:26:34] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:26:37] while the headstone is coming down to
[1:26:38] unite with the body but when that head
[1:26:41] and body unites together the full power
[1:26:43] of the holy ghost would raise her up
[1:26:45] just exactly like that even the dead
[1:26:47] that's the dead in christ for hundreds
[1:26:49] of years ago will raise and the beauty
[1:26:50] of his holiness to take a flight to the
[1:26:53] skies the dynamics is the holy ghost
[1:26:57] amen and that's what's happening because
[1:26:58] remember it's not just a uniting it's
[1:27:01] got to be uniting and with individuals
[1:27:04] remember
[1:27:05] a church by association is not going
[1:27:07] into rapture
[1:27:08] it's individuals
[1:27:09] right it's individuals that are united
[1:27:11] with the headstone they go on the
[1:27:13] rapture so as we see more and more
[1:27:15] believers being united as he comes down
[1:27:17] what's happened the dynamics comes in a
[1:27:19] greater measure
[1:27:20] hallelujah because remember the dynamics
[1:27:22] of this church is a refilling of the
[1:27:23] holy ghost what is worked in small
[1:27:26] measure while the headstones coming down
[1:27:28] to unite with the body when their head
[1:27:30] and body unites together the full power
[1:27:31] of the holy ghost would raise her up
[1:27:33] just exactly like that even the dead
[1:27:35] and here we are
[1:27:37] this is what's going on this is this is
[1:27:39] this is current affairs
[1:27:41] amen
[1:27:43] hallelujah
[1:27:45] our god is working
[1:27:46] what has been laying on tape and just in
[1:27:49] the pages of the scriptures becoming
[1:27:51] living
[1:27:52] and it's actually you know because
[1:27:53] elisha
[1:27:54] he couldn't just point back and say well
[1:27:56] elijah did this and elijah did this so
[1:27:58] he would have enjoyed the testimonies of
[1:28:00] elijah
[1:28:01] but he had to realize the same god
[1:28:03] that's why when he took the mantle he
[1:28:04] smote the jordan where's the god of
[1:28:05] elijah
[1:28:07] i need more than just a historical event
[1:28:09] i mean to part these waters i need that
[1:28:11] same god to be alive in my life i mean
[1:28:13] and the and the waters part it says the
[1:28:15] same thing with you and i we appreciate
[1:28:16] everything that the
[1:28:18] that god did through the prophet
[1:28:20] but he's the god of the bride
[1:28:22] lord jesus christ right that mighty
[1:28:24] angel that descended
[1:28:26] didn't leave when the prophet left he's
[1:28:28] the same god who turned up at camp the
[1:28:30] mighty angel himself jesus christ it
[1:28:33] wasn't a different one it was the same
[1:28:34] god and he came to unite himself with a
[1:28:36] people
[1:28:37] hallelujah that's why it's so powerful i
[1:28:39] mean when you can see that actually god
[1:28:41] is uniting himself not just with all but
[1:28:42] with young people
[1:28:44] hello he's the old god of the old is god
[1:28:46] of the young he's the god of the middle
[1:28:48] age god of the teenage god of every age
[1:28:50] he's the same god
[1:28:52] hallelujah
[1:28:53] god uniting himself with his people
[1:28:57] amen
[1:28:58] yeah i'm so glad
[1:29:00] 10 15 well i haven't been here that long
[1:29:02] but you know i came to the message
[1:29:05] you tell people what god had done for
[1:29:06] you they look at you like they have no
[1:29:07] idea what you're talking about
[1:29:10] unfortunately but now as time's gone
[1:29:12] along
[1:29:13] more and more people have got the holy
[1:29:15] ghost
[1:29:16] and it's not just being a good church
[1:29:18] person the word becomes alive god
[1:29:20] becomes real to them they say my father
[1:29:23] you're real you're more than my father's
[1:29:24] experience my mom's experience you're
[1:29:26] the same god
[1:29:28] and i'm so glad that wiggletails can't
[1:29:30] get into this experience because we have
[1:29:32] a living word we don't have a historical
[1:29:34] word that can go rotten right but we of
[1:29:37] living where fresh matter from the holy
[1:29:39] of holies that never goes off
[1:29:41] hallelujah
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:46] hallelujah
[1:29:47] we have a part to play
[1:29:49] in getting the dead saints out of the
[1:29:51] grave
[1:29:53] right
[1:29:54] elisha had a part to play
[1:29:56] to get that guy resurrected you say but
[1:29:58] he was dead what part did he have to
[1:29:59] play he had to receive the life
[1:30:02] he had to have the quickening power
[1:30:04] hallelujah and he received it
[1:30:07] before it came on display now
[1:30:09] i feel like i'm stumbling around here
[1:30:11] but we'll get somewhere no
[1:30:13] and wisdom versus faith
[1:30:15] so this is what we've got to do because
[1:30:16] the devil loves to tell us that the word
[1:30:18] is not for you who's ever had that i've
[1:30:21] had him come you know when i was in the
[1:30:22] pentecostal church before i came to the
[1:30:24] message i never had a voice in my head
[1:30:26] saying you should leave you should leave
[1:30:28] this is not true you should leave and
[1:30:30] then you come into the truth and there's
[1:30:32] like a little imp sitting on your
[1:30:33] shoulder you should leave this is not
[1:30:35] for you you should leave i said satan no
[1:30:37] no i'm staying here you go out
[1:30:39] because it's a mind battle because the
[1:30:41] devil because the devil's afraid because
[1:30:44] he has a good memory
[1:30:46] the devil has a very good memory hey he
[1:30:48] brings up your past all the time
[1:30:50] and and he brings details
[1:30:53] but he also has a memory every time he
[1:30:55] was defeated
[1:30:57] so he's seen the power when god and man
[1:30:59] unites when two omnipotents come
[1:31:02] together and the supernatural takes
[1:31:04] place he knows what it's like to be cast
[1:31:06] out of legion that whole legion of
[1:31:08] devils remembers that day
[1:31:10] hallelujah amen you know those those
[1:31:13] seven devils and mary magdalene they
[1:31:14] remember the day they were cast out of
[1:31:16] her
[1:31:18] and all the way down through the
[1:31:19] scripture
[1:31:21] he remembers when he was defeated
[1:31:23] because devils have good memories
[1:31:26] hallelujah
[1:31:27] amen but the thing is now
[1:31:30] we
[1:31:31] have to remind him
[1:31:33] that he's a defeated being
[1:31:35] you have to remind them we face a
[1:31:37] defeated foe
[1:31:39] hallelujah
[1:31:40] because so what he tries to do so i just
[1:31:43] go back to my thought about that as he
[1:31:44] tries to keep us away from the promise
[1:31:47] of god because he's seen what he's what
[1:31:48] it's done in the past
[1:31:50] he's seen the power of god come down and
[1:31:52] cast him out out of many many lives down
[1:31:54] through the ages so he knows if he could
[1:31:57] just keep people from the promise
[1:31:59] he has control in their life
[1:32:01] so the devil sitting on your shoulder
[1:32:03] saying it's not for you you're not
[1:32:04] feeling anything you're not getting
[1:32:05] anything out of this camp was a waste of
[1:32:07] time wave that's the devil trying to
[1:32:09] fight you
[1:32:10] trying to get you to believe it's not
[1:32:12] for you
[1:32:13] but yet there's a pull
[1:32:15] hallelujah you actually
[1:32:17] there's a hunger in your heart
[1:32:19] for god so what's that god telling you
[1:32:20] actually it is for you
[1:32:23] but you've got to make the word your own
[1:32:26] it's not just my word
[1:32:27] this message is not just brother brown's
[1:32:29] message it was never his message to
[1:32:30] start with it was god's message
[1:32:32] and it was for the elect
[1:32:34] hallelujah so it's for you and i
[1:32:36] he says in wisdom versus faith why did
[1:32:38] jesus stand there and say to mary and
[1:32:40] martha take her take you away the stone
[1:32:43] why he was god he could have said stone
[1:32:45] be no more and it wouldn't have been no
[1:32:46] more but he had something to do but she
[1:32:48] had something to do
[1:32:50] why did he stand there and look upon the
[1:32:52] harvest you believe is the lord of the
[1:32:54] harvest
[1:32:55] he said to his disciples you pray the
[1:32:57] lord of the harvest that he'll send
[1:32:58] laborers into his harvest other words
[1:33:00] you ask me to do what i'm going to do
[1:33:02] see
[1:33:04] we're buddies
[1:33:05] we're it's it's a church we've got
[1:33:07] something to do ourselves you've got to
[1:33:09] do uh you've got something to do here's
[1:33:12] the gospel
[1:33:13] i know it but if you just let it sit
[1:33:15] there and don't preach it what good is
[1:33:17] it what good is it going to do see
[1:33:19] you've got something to do you've got to
[1:33:21] make an effort you say well i believe
[1:33:23] god can heal but i just don't know
[1:33:25] stand up and let that word become your
[1:33:28] word believe it don't reason it just
[1:33:30] believe it
[1:33:32] i mean to let that word become your word
[1:33:34] make it personal for you buy his stripes
[1:33:36] i'm healed
[1:33:38] he is my savior here's my redeemer
[1:33:40] here's my peace he is my advocate he's
[1:33:42] my comforter my god he's my lord he's my
[1:33:44] all in all not someone else's he's mine
[1:33:48] amen so we have something to do in the
[1:33:50] end time
[1:33:52] make the word our word
[1:33:54] and let it live in our lives
[1:33:57] hallelujah
[1:33:59] see elisha
[1:34:02] elisha became the living word for his
[1:34:05] day
[1:34:06] elijah lived his portion
[1:34:08] taken up in a rapture but now it was
[1:34:10] elisha's ministry and as i said in the
[1:34:12] very beginning elijah types christ
[1:34:16] and elisha types the bride
[1:34:18] right so we are now living out our part
[1:34:21] of the ministry
[1:34:23] amen that shouldn't be a shock
[1:34:25] right we're actually here to be a living
[1:34:27] witness
[1:34:28] amen there
[1:34:30] jesus would say uh i would say in the
[1:34:32] church age book
[1:34:34] he would say this he says the people who
[1:34:36] took his revelation from god
[1:34:38] became the living epistles reader known
[1:34:41] of all men for their generation
[1:34:43] when the methodists failed god raised up
[1:34:45] others and so it has gone on through the
[1:34:48] years until on this last day
[1:34:51] hello people in the last day
[1:34:53] there is another there is again another
[1:34:55] people in the land who under their
[1:34:57] messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:34:59] final age
[1:35:01] hallelujah so there will be a people on
[1:35:03] the earth that will be the final voice
[1:35:06] to the final age they won't be debaters
[1:35:09] but the word will be living
[1:35:11] their lives will be lived voices
[1:35:15] he says yes sir the church is no longer
[1:35:17] the mouthpiece of god it's its own
[1:35:18] mouthpiece so god is turning on her he
[1:35:21] will be confounded he will confound her
[1:35:24] through the prophet and the bride for
[1:35:26] the voice of god will be in her
[1:35:29] i mean yes it is for it says in the in
[1:35:31] the last chapter of revelation verse 17
[1:35:34] the spirit and the bride say come once
[1:35:36] more the world will hear direct from god
[1:35:39] is at pentecost but of course that word
[1:35:41] bride will be reputed uh as in the first
[1:35:45] age
[1:35:46] so he says that the voice of god is in
[1:35:48] her
[1:35:49] hallelujah says i can't remember who was
[1:35:51] saying about prayer i think it's brother
[1:35:52] andy
[1:35:54] when inspiration comes and you pray
[1:35:58] or you don't feel inspiration and you
[1:35:59] pray you pray in faith who's praying
[1:36:01] through you
[1:36:02] is it your own top two inches using your
[1:36:04] vocal lord no it's god
[1:36:07] holy why because you become a living
[1:36:09] bible
[1:36:11] and the word has to be spoken
[1:36:13] and it's not just spoken by words or is
[1:36:15] it spoken through a life
[1:36:17] right i'll you know we preach
[1:36:20] i don't just preach here
[1:36:22] my life
[1:36:23] i trust the preachers the truth but our
[1:36:25] lives preach something too we are
[1:36:27] declaring something
[1:36:28] right rather than declaring the word or
[1:36:30] the world
[1:36:31] i want to preach the word
[1:36:34] my life not me actively oh i've got to
[1:36:36] do no no it's my life subconsciously
[1:36:38] should be
[1:36:39] preaching a message
[1:36:41] hallelujah
[1:36:43] amen so here we are
[1:36:45] elisha
[1:36:47] became
[1:36:48] a living voice to that age
[1:36:52] hallelujah now
[1:36:55] we know in revelations 10 you know it's
[1:36:57] quite a scene but we understand that
[1:36:59] that mighty angel has descended brother
[1:37:01] braham says that the seventh angel
[1:37:03] earthly angel is on is on
[1:37:05] earth at the time of that coming of
[1:37:07] revelations 10 1 coming down so we know
[1:37:09] this has already happened christ himself
[1:37:11] has come in word form right but then
[1:37:13] john is instructed to take the book that
[1:37:16] he wasn't even worthy to look upon
[1:37:18] revelations 5 and eat the book and
[1:37:20] prophesy again so there came a time when
[1:37:23] the prophet's ministry was over now john
[1:37:25] who's a symbol of you and i remember one
[1:37:28] man in a vision can represent a whole
[1:37:30] body of people because at the end of
[1:37:32] revelations 4 1 there he says i saw a
[1:37:35] door open in heaven and a voice he come
[1:37:37] up hither and that's the rapture at the
[1:37:38] end of the later cnh right so one man
[1:37:41] represents the whole redeemed group of
[1:37:43] people
[1:37:44] right and so he's instructed to take the
[1:37:47] book eat the book or become one with the
[1:37:49] word
[1:37:50] and then speak its contents
[1:37:52] that's why it's very important
[1:37:55] when when we preach when we speak about
[1:37:58] our own selves
[1:37:59] we don't confess our humanity's failings
[1:38:03] we speak the contents of the book
[1:38:06] we talk about who we are in christ what
[1:38:08] he has made us
[1:38:10] if you want to be negative you won't get
[1:38:11] anywhere that's why i always say i can't
[1:38:13] remember who said it at camp but always
[1:38:14] think positive about yourself i mean
[1:38:17] confess positive things i'm an overcomer
[1:38:20] i'm accepted in the beloved i mean
[1:38:23] here's my peace my sins are gone i'm
[1:38:25] going to heaven the lord's found me he's
[1:38:28] keeping me he's going to see me through
[1:38:31] hallelujah the devil's defeated i face a
[1:38:33] defeated foe you've got to confess those
[1:38:35] kind of things
[1:38:36] hallelujah
[1:38:38] it's very important
[1:38:39] amen so now
[1:38:41] elisha came to a point where
[1:38:45] that quickening power was in him and
[1:38:47] this is where we are right now
[1:38:49] we're not waiting for it to come it's
[1:38:50] come brother abraham says that the holy
[1:38:52] ghost was bound at the doors of creeds
[1:38:54] and dogmas has been loosed upon the
[1:38:56] people by the message of the hour
[1:38:58] because we've been restored back to the
[1:38:59] truth of the scripture
[1:39:01] hallelujah and then so now what has
[1:39:03] happened in this day so well let's just
[1:39:05] jump back again
[1:39:06] elisha was beholding christ and elijah
[1:39:10] and what you look at you become
[1:39:14] and so now we've had we've had another
[1:39:17] you say christ has been on display again
[1:39:19] in this end time
[1:39:20] now i don't want to be too much longer
[1:39:22] but
[1:39:24] we have in the feast
[1:39:26] the
[1:39:26] feast in leviticus of the way sheath
[1:39:29] being waved the day after the sabbath
[1:39:32] and we know that what happened is is you
[1:39:34] know they'll take the mature part of the
[1:39:36] field they'll cut it down and the priest
[1:39:38] would wave it before the lord giving
[1:39:40] thanks to god that the rest of the seed
[1:39:42] in the field was going to come forth to
[1:39:44] the same maturity as this part of the
[1:39:47] field and so jesus was the first wave
[1:39:49] sheath
[1:39:50] i mean here's the mature part of the of
[1:39:53] the field remember we are his brethren
[1:39:56] we are his family so the same seed in
[1:39:59] him sure he didn't need to be redeemed
[1:40:00] he wasn't born lost
[1:40:02] but that same seed that was in him as in
[1:40:05] you and i
[1:40:06] when when the marriage of the lamb has
[1:40:08] come which it has
[1:40:09] it's like mary's like
[1:40:12] right it's like mary's like i married
[1:40:14] another human being
[1:40:17] you know marriage is between you know
[1:40:19] you can't marry different species so
[1:40:20] when the lord unites himself with his
[1:40:22] bride she is made of the same material
[1:40:25] he is
[1:40:26] halloween this is what the lord i trust
[1:40:28] as he's been walking with you you begin
[1:40:29] to realize i made a different stuff
[1:40:31] than the rest of the world not my
[1:40:33] humanity now but there's a cg in me i
[1:40:36] mean that's expressing itself hallelujah
[1:40:38] i made a different kind of stuff so now
[1:40:40] the priest would take that wave sheath
[1:40:42] and wave it before the lord and brother
[1:40:44] ram said on the day of pentecost that
[1:40:45] same wave sheath was waved not just as a
[1:40:48] symbol but in reality the holy ghost was
[1:40:49] waved over the people and god was giving
[1:40:53] praise it was god actually rejoicing
[1:40:54] saying there's more seed in the field
[1:40:56] that come forth just like this one and
[1:40:59] he says at the end time that has
[1:41:01] happened again
[1:41:02] there's been a mature life
[1:41:05] has been waved over the earth
[1:41:07] and the lord is giving thanks because
[1:41:08] there's other seed i wasn't alive in
[1:41:11] 1965 or 1963. i was born in 85 but god
[1:41:15] saw that i was in the field
[1:41:17] there was seed that had to come forth so
[1:41:19] now this word's been waved over the
[1:41:21] earth hallelujah and god's giving thanks
[1:41:24] saying that the rest of the seed in the
[1:41:26] field is going to come forth just like
[1:41:27] this one which is the word in flesh
[1:41:30] hallelujah it's that same quickening
[1:41:32] power i mean that was displayed on the
[1:41:34] day of pentecost that came into a people
[1:41:36] brought them to maturity that same
[1:41:37] quickening power has been waived in this
[1:41:39] end time in a prophet's ministry
[1:41:42] hallelujah and what's god doing he's
[1:41:45] praying he's giving thanks saying
[1:41:47] there's others like this that are going
[1:41:49] to come forth and now what happens is
[1:41:51] the lord found you just like elijah
[1:41:54] found elisha
[1:41:56] and now he's been brooding over your
[1:41:57] life
[1:41:58] a life has been waved in front of you
[1:42:01] more than doctrine more than books and
[1:42:02] tastes but all those things but it is
[1:42:04] the lord himself
[1:42:06] has been waved in front of you and
[1:42:08] you've been beholding an image i trust
[1:42:10] as you've walked with god you've seen
[1:42:11] god mature you and mold you and shape
[1:42:15] you and stabilize you and encourage you
[1:42:17] and strengthen you what's happening is
[1:42:19] you're becoming what you're beholding
[1:42:22] hallelujah and then so what is that now
[1:42:24] there's now a quickening so the holy
[1:42:26] ghost has come into you you have the
[1:42:28] same quickening power and elisha
[1:42:31] is now in you not just in the shadow
[1:42:33] form but in reality and a greater
[1:42:34] measure because of the blood of jesus
[1:42:36] christ now when they you know the lord
[1:42:39] has descended with a shout out right
[1:42:41] brother bram says in the rapture message
[1:42:43] that the shout is the message
[1:42:46] right it's not a
[1:42:47] it's not something we've got to work out
[1:42:49] he just says the shout is the message
[1:42:51] right he does all three things as he
[1:42:52] just as as he descends
[1:42:55] the shout the voice and the trumpet now
[1:42:58] the shout is the message now the voice
[1:43:00] we are to be lived voices
[1:43:02] so now that life comes into you and i
[1:43:05] and then our lives are actually
[1:43:07] voices speaking
[1:43:09] and brother braham says in
[1:43:11] if i can find it here but he says what
[1:43:13] jeffersonville needs today
[1:43:15] is thousands of lived voices
[1:43:18] the thunder of god thundering out in
[1:43:21] sweetness and holiness and purity
[1:43:23] undefiled lives
[1:43:25] walking around in the earth today
[1:43:27] without a blemish yes sir real
[1:43:29] christians that's thunder against the
[1:43:31] enemy
[1:43:32] the inner the devil don't care how loud
[1:43:34] you can holler the devil don't care how
[1:43:36] much you can jump up or how much you can
[1:43:38] do this or that or shout but what hurts
[1:43:40] the devil is to see that sanctified holy
[1:43:44] consecrated life to god say anything to
[1:43:46] him call him anything just as sweet as
[1:43:49] it can be and move right on oh my that
[1:43:52] throws him away that's the thunder that
[1:43:54] shakes the devil
[1:43:56] so if we really want to shake the devil
[1:43:59] just live a sweet undefiled holy pure
[1:44:02] life before god just love the lord with
[1:44:04] all your heart that will shake the devil
[1:44:06] real good i like to see him shook
[1:44:08] don't you hallelujah
[1:44:10] amen and by
[1:44:12] the baptism the holy ghost we can live
[1:44:13] such a life
[1:44:15] hallelujah and then so now so there's
[1:44:17] the shout now the voice now
[1:44:20] now after these things what happens is
[1:44:22] the dead in christ race
[1:44:24] what brings them from the
[1:44:26] from the grave
[1:44:28] because remember it's a harvest
[1:44:30] so when god looks to upon the earth it's
[1:44:33] just like a natural harvest a farmer
[1:44:35] doesn't just wake up one day and say
[1:44:36] well it's the 25th of december or no not
[1:44:39] christmas but you know it's a certain
[1:44:40] day in the calendar i'm going to harvest
[1:44:42] my wheat now
[1:44:43] no he looked at the condition of the
[1:44:45] field
[1:44:46] and he says it's ready
[1:44:48] it's all golden it's all bowing before
[1:44:50] the presence of the sun it doesn't think
[1:44:52] it's something sticking up and saying
[1:44:53] look at me it's bound to the one that's
[1:44:55] worshipping right there's a maturity in
[1:44:57] the people
[1:44:59] am i just like remember immature wheat
[1:45:01] stands up like this look at me look what
[1:45:02] i can do but mature wheat bowls to the
[1:45:05] one that worships right it's the same
[1:45:07] thing with a mature believer it doesn't
[1:45:09] say look at me look what i can do about
[1:45:11] say lord you're my life you're my
[1:45:13] everything the only good in my life is
[1:45:15] you it's not me
[1:45:17] hello amen so now
[1:45:19] when the when the wheat comes to
[1:45:21] maturity then they then the farmer says
[1:45:24] i'm going to get the combine out and
[1:45:25] we're going to harvest
[1:45:26] so now what will bring the dead from the
[1:45:30] grave the dead in christ is a life
[1:45:33] on display
[1:45:35] the quickening power
[1:45:36] amen when the lord sees us come to that
[1:45:38] level of maturity whatever he dictates
[1:45:40] that to be
[1:45:41] then that life out the life within us
[1:45:44] will call the dead from the grave the
[1:45:46] dead in christ and then the rapture is
[1:45:48] on
[1:45:49] hallelujah
[1:45:51] that's why we said this
[1:45:53] that elisha's last miracle
[1:45:57] as the bride's last miracle
[1:45:59] amen
[1:46:01] and we are living that miracle out
[1:46:05] you know the thing is
[1:46:06] we get a you know everyone knows what it
[1:46:09] means to be acclimatized day
[1:46:11] like if you're not used to living at
[1:46:13] altitude and you go up there you find it
[1:46:15] hard to breathe but eventually you get
[1:46:16] acclimatized
[1:46:18] so you get used to a different
[1:46:19] atmosphere and it becomes normal
[1:46:21] you know what happens is you know
[1:46:24] we live in the world this is me anyway i
[1:46:26] was lost undone in the world i was used
[1:46:28] to that atmosphere
[1:46:30] but then i came into a different
[1:46:31] atmosphere of the holy ghost
[1:46:34] and you get acclimatized thank god to
[1:46:36] that kind of atmosphere and that's the
[1:46:37] atmosphere you want to stay in but then
[1:46:39] what happens is sometimes i mean we've
[1:46:41] got to go like we can't live as monks
[1:46:44] i'd love to buy the camp
[1:46:45] praise a lot but we can't live at camp
[1:46:48] we have to go out and be a living
[1:46:49] witness
[1:46:50] god wants us he's not afraid to put us
[1:46:52] in ladies here he's not afraid to put
[1:46:55] his bride in satan's eden he engineered
[1:46:57] it this way he had satan i'm going to
[1:46:59] put her in the worst stage of the worst
[1:47:00] time you can do basically everything you
[1:47:02] want certain limitations of course right
[1:47:05] but she is made in such a way that she's
[1:47:07] ordained not to fall amen that the world
[1:47:10] can be so dark and so wicked but she'll
[1:47:12] stand amen in the beauty of holiness and
[1:47:15] just keep walking on with god
[1:47:17] hallelujah we're made of hey if you're
[1:47:20] fallen this week just get back up
[1:47:22] if you have failed you may have failed
[1:47:25] monday monday night or tuesday morning
[1:47:27] you might just just get back up it's not
[1:47:30] him that falls at him that gets back up
[1:47:32] hallelujah
[1:47:34] amen
[1:47:35] you know but here we are
[1:47:37] here we are with this quickening power
[1:47:40] it's going to bring them from the grave
[1:47:41] you know we shouldn't be afraid to be
[1:47:42] alive in this age
[1:47:44] we have nothing to fear so i'm finished
[1:47:46] with that but you know we are living
[1:47:49] here we are living out this miracle as i
[1:47:51] said about being acclimatized you get
[1:47:53] used to a certain atmosphere then you go
[1:47:55] out into the world and the atmosphere
[1:47:57] you once enjoyed you say this is
[1:47:58] horrible
[1:47:59] they feel like dark yucky kind of you
[1:48:01] know that's the evil spirits it used to
[1:48:03] be yes they have fellowship i'm sitting
[1:48:04] by myself you said fellowship with those
[1:48:06] things but then god set you free and
[1:48:08] takes you to another atmosphere and that
[1:48:11] atmosphere
[1:48:12] becomes normal
[1:48:14] you get used to it you get used to being
[1:48:16] in heavenly places right you used to
[1:48:19] walk into your home in this piece and
[1:48:20] you know it's a different kind of
[1:48:22] atmosphere but don't let it become
[1:48:24] common
[1:48:26] you know oh you know you feel like
[1:48:27] you've lost like no no you just come

[1:48:59] make the dead man come to life the life
[1:49:01] was already in him that resurrection
[1:49:03] power was already within him and it's
[1:49:05] the life of christ
[1:49:07] by the new birth
[1:49:09] inner people will bring forth the dead
