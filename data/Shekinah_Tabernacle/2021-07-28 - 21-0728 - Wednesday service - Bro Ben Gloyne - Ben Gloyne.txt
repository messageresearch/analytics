for your glory we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen amen so let's turn to the book of judges uh we're going to read from judges chapter 6 and then we're going to go to jeremiah 1. amen everyone happy to be in the house of the lord tonight amen so we're in judges chapter 6 and we're going to read from verse 11. we're going to read verses one and two first actually we'll drop down to verse 11. uh sorry so verse one thank you and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years and the hand of midian prevailed against israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made them dens which were in the mountains and caves and strongholds so they just tried to hide away from the problem and we go down to verse 11 and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which was an offer that pertained unto joash the abazarite and his son gideon thresh wheat by the wine priest to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of hell and gideon said unto him o my lord if the lord be with us why then does all this befall in us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of the midianites and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and that and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee and he said unto him o my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my father's house amen and let's go to jeremiah 1 um i was going to read jeremiah 1 verses 4 down to 9. read this here jeremiah one and four it says this amen if you're there say amen if you're on your way you're on your way jeremiah 1 4 then the word of the lord came unto me saying before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations then said i ah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a child but the lord said unto me say not i'm a child for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thee thou shall speak be not afraid of their faces for i am worthy to to deliver thee uh saith the lord and then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth amen may the lord bless the reading of his word you may have the comfort of your seats tonight and i want to speak if i can approach a subject about when god and man meets together now it's very to me it's very incredible how we would read here in in the book of judges where where gideon you know gideon was threshing wheat and secret hiding it from the midianites we read there that they because the israel did evil in the side of the lord the midianites came in and they took over basically and and israel's answer was instead of repenting and seeking god they just built caves and dens and they just tried to hide away from the problem instead of facing the problem hit on and uh but we see here that that that gideon you know it's amazing the difference between what we say about ourselves and what god says about us they can be two polar opposite things very very very polarly opposite so here is gideon the angel of the lord says that he's a mighty man of valor and he's gonna deliver uh you know and and and this angel's going to tell him go in this thy might and he's threshing wheat in secret and his response uh to the lord is i am you know i'm the least of my brethren and my family is poor uh i'm the least of my father's house and my family is poor in manasseh this was this was what he thought about himself but what god said about him was very different and we really need to look at ourselves the way god looks at us amen because we've got to understand that the way god sees us is how the lord said to get in the mighty man of allah he was threshing wheat by you know in secret there but in him was this mighty man of valor and this is how god saw him and so so gideon had to get a revelation i am a mighty man of valor i am here to actually deliver i'm here for a job and that job is not to thresh wheat in secret hiding from my enemy hoping that something will will cause them to go away but actually god's gonna make me step on the battlefield and i'm the one who's gonna drive them out you know brother brown would say in the deity of jesus christ he said he said and that same power that same christ hallelujah he says let the fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of god say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the holy ghost that's right men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil's tried to hide you back tell you you're some little count down something you're not you're sons and daughters of god the deity is not in heaven it's in you hallelujah i know you think i'm crazy but let me tell you something brother i mean when you realize that almighty god lives in you immortal life my life i give zoe the life of god is in the human being he can stand back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs obese ducks chickens animals created everything and nothing was made but what was made by him who christ the deity he brought down plagues everything in the days of egypt to christ he stopped the mouths of lions he quenched the violence of fire he escaped i mean they escape the edge of the sword they raise the dead from the grave who christ oh my what will it be who is he christ the deity and brother sister that deities and you who believes that tonight amen a little while the world saith me no more but yet you shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age christ in the in the manger no christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping christ in the manger but christ in you the holy ghost the hope of life hallelujah the creator god himself dwelling in the human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but we're but we'll see him as he is for will be made like him the spirit in the human being uh louis he says that we know that you know that may be kind of uh not uh rather elementary to us all but the same one that made sun moon and stars dwells in you it's not unless a god a different god it's the same one but you see gideon forgot his position remember he was a circumcised jew living under a covenant in the promised land but he forgot all about that and he was hiding away from the enemy and you know even even his name is is very telling in this because the name manasseh which is the tribe that he came from it means causing to forget that's what manasseh means so he was living by the name of his tribe causing to forget what was he forgetting who he was what god had made him to be what his birth made him amen as a circumcised son of abraham living in the promised land that was his ordained position but he forgot about that and his actions proved that he forgot about it now i love the name gideon to me it's pretty cool it means it means to uh it means a fella not you fella but a fella as in a warrior and that word comes from to foul a tree or generally to destroy anything that's his that's his first name he can just just destroy anything harley if he only had a revelation of the of the covenant he was meant to live under then he would have destroyed anything he would have been walking in power i mean because god made him that hallelujah so you know but the thing is he wasn't living by that name he was living by this name of of manasseh causing to forget so his circumstances and what everyone else in the church was doing around him caused him to forget his covenant with god and caused them to just hide away but it took the angel lord to come and visit him to awaken him to realize actually you're going to start living by your name gideon and you're going to destroy these hosts of midian as one man hallelujah that's why you know the devil brother that's why brother brown said it as i read the quote that you know it's time we recognize who we are you know i'm sure you know there'll come a time when our eyes come fully open we're really the reality of who we are right now because the scripture tells us now we're the sons of god not one day right now i mean but our eyes are going to come open i am a son of god i am a daughter of god i have i have a position and authority that the devil's got to back up he's got to give room he's got to be cast out he's got to leave in the name of jesus christ so you know the devil's trying to hide you back and that's what gideon was basically hidden back to tell you you're some little cow down something he says i'm the least of my in my father's house and i'm i'm from a very poor tribe what was that the devil trying to hide him back making some count down something but the angel came to him and said no you're a mighty man of valor go on this thymite you're that same angel that meant gideon is the same one that's came down in the end time hallelujah because that was god himself came down an angelic form to gideon amen amen so we we're going to recognize that deity is not just in heaven it's in you and i by the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah now jesus we know jesus was fully god but he was fully man he had to be god because only god could fulfill his own word but he had to be fully man because he had to be our kinsmen redeemer but jesus had a revelation of who he was right he had jesus had perfect faith is from the message perfect faith jesus had perfect faith he had it uh and it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word that's why it's a good ever welcoming spirit lord minister to me change my life to match your word if you abide in me and my words and you my words this word this word abides in you then ask what you will and it shall be done see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you've said then you shall have what you said amen when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for you shall have it it will be given to you space time nothing else will ever change it you know it's done it's already over with and when god anchors the revelation in your heart space and time don't matter you know it's already done hallelujah now watch now he said to us if you abide in me and my word and you saint john here you can ask what you will it'll be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer who's done that you know when i read about uh gideon and the midianites i don't identify as a midianite or a child of the east i don't identify those guys there's just nothing in me that says i'm one of them i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them i'm not one of them but i can identify with gideon having real struggles with my humanity and my circumstances and what my five senses declare but then i can i can identify when gideon when god comes to him and speaks to him and says you're a mighty man of allah i mean you're more than what you think you are and now i'm going to begin to show you what's in you and this is what the lord is here to do that's what this mess has actually come to do is show the bride what's already in here amen what did brother braham say that we had we received a wedding band of unmerited pre-disney grace before the foundation of the world but we had to come to a place where our eyes came open we realized by revelation i do have that wedding band on i'm you know i'm i'm i'm i'm built to fit the role as the bride hallelujah so he says then recognize your position in the scripture as a believer have we done that amen then you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position hallelujah amen brother ban would say in the church age book the first chapter the revelation of jesus christ he says now as i've already said this book the revelation is a consummation of the scripture it is it is even placed exactly right in the canon of scripture at the end now you can know why it says that anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of god that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing as such prevailing power as the revelation of the word there's prevailing power in revelation that's why the prophet says you should pray for revelation more than anything and it's very vital say lord reveal who you are in the word and reveal who i am and you in the word because that will give you prevailing power what did the angel come to gideon to do to give him revelation you're a mighty man of valor goldness thy might you're going to deliver israel as one man it was already locked within him but it took an angelic visitation to actually reveal the warrior within him amen it takes the same thing with you and i you know there's an overcomer locked within us amen it's already that person's already there maybe just dormant but you know but when the holy ghost comes the word comes and begins to spring to life and we begin to really realize actually we had overcome we're made to overcome we're purpose built to overcome hallelujah and so there's nothing as prevailing there's nothing as such prevailing power as the revelation of the word what caused david to prevail over goliath revelation what caused him to prevail even over saul and his tricks revelation what was the revelation i'm king i'm going to sit on the throne amen so it didn't matter what was coming in in his life there's a lot of dangers david faced but here prevailing revelation lord you anointed me by a vindicated proven prophet of israel that i was gonna sit on the throne and be king and your spirit confirmed the word to me with signs following hallelujah i'm on my way to the throne and nothing could stop him getting there but he had a lot of trouble getting there right but his his revelation prevailed over his circumstances and that's going to be the same thing with you and i the revelation of who we are in the word amen will prevail over all circumstances if you lean lean to your revelation as opposed to your five senses amen hallelujah now he says in the same chapter i believe this bible is accurate amen jesus completely authenticated the old testament uh when here on earth and was uh and it was compiled exactly as was our new testament make no mistake about it we have the infallible word of god today and no man dares to add uh take from it or add to it but we need the same spirit that gave it to teach it to us oh how we need the revelation by the spirit we don't need a new bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and not and i'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank god we can have what we need for god wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become and and become by it the living word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify god our father in heaven amen but now the thing is amnesia can set in if you haven't listened to a sermon that really packs a lot of punch listen to spiritual amnesia it's a very powerful message brother brown only preaches it once was a very powerful message and he says one of the one of the problems you know amnesia comes from from a variety of things he says now this amnesia it means you can you can come to a place where you cannot identify yourself it's an unusual thing it don't happen too often but the causes is from shock now not just shell shock like a wall but shock stress it's sometimes it uh that it's somebody that don't even know who they are you find it in war sometimes soldiers get it sometimes people get it another thing cause it is worry worry will cause amnesia so worry will cause a person to forget who they are in the lord right because this is what he's talking about spiritual amnesia we're not immune from these things but we have overcoming power to overcome them amy because remember there's no bomb too big there's no shock too great there's no hardship that's too terrible that god could not take you through and make you a better christian because of it amen so you know there's the yeah there's nothing that can leave us in a crippled state but we will be uh yeah we will overcome worry so worry will cause it worry has no virtue to it at all yeah just skip worry and accept faith i like how he says that just oh there's worry then there's faith just skip worry and go to faith amen hallelujah it's like playing monopoly and you get a you know a chance card you go around you skip a whole bunch of stuff and you get to go whatever yo just skip skip worry and go to faith someone said well now what if i'm going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry i said no i don't think so why i said worry won't do nothing but make me worse you know i think we've had that conversation i had it with the girls i said there's no one in the history of humanity that worries helped no one it's a proven fact that's not fake news that that's true but faith has helped many people we have a testimony here testimony here where faith has come on the scene and delivered amen helped guided strengthened amen so he says well what good is it to have faith i said it might deliver me and that's right see so worry has no virtue to it at all but faith has all virtue belief amen bc worry will sometimes cause it now another thing that it will cause among people is getting between two opinions that'll cause amnesia is the word right is it wrong is the message true is it false is jesus real is he not is this just my parents thing or is he real to me are my friends right or am i right you know my parents writer is the society right you know there's these many things can be two opinions is he still the same or is he different does he still save that way is he saying is he the same god we're here on tape is he the same today or is he not there could be two opinions he's the same today he hasn't changed one iota he cannot change that's one thing god cannot do one thing he cannot lie one thing he cannot change this those things are impossibility with god he cannot do those things so it's getting between two opinions will cause amnesia and it will get you to a place you actually what you've done you've lost your reasons what should be the christian's reasons the word is true that should be our reason god is right the word is true amen you've lost your mind you can't you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself you can walk around eating everything but still you can't identify yourself you have got your scholarly education some education you had but you don't know where it come from you don't know who you are where you belong it's amnesia so we are told but familiar places in the scripture bring a break in amnesia right familiar places just like brother would tell the story of the soldier that got shell shock and the war forgot who he was and and they put a whole bunch of them on a railroad car and they were going to take them to a mental asylum and then they you know the train stopped at a certain station and they let the prisoners out and then one of them began to look around different to the others and begin to look at different landmarks and begin to walk and one of the guards was going to stop him but the other guard said just follow him see where he goes and he begins to walk here he goes down the hill he sees a water tank or something and he stops looks and then he goes down this other path he comes to a house he finally says going up the steps to the house an old man comes out the front door amen and he says son i always believe you'd come home given a big hug and then when that happened brother ram says the amnesia and the soldier broke and he realized who he was why because familiar places brought him back to his father it's the same thing in the word familiar places in the world will take you back to your heavenly father it'll break the amnesia and you'll realize you're a son or daughter of god well that's why it's so important to keep your eyes on the word it will show you who you are it'll tell you who you're not like i said i'm not a midianite the word tells me i'm not a midianite i'm a believer amen so we don't want to be between two opinions but the devil will try to get us between two opinions he will try and he will try and get us to worry right because he wants to make us forget who we are because if we know who we are the devil's whipped hallelujah amen but if he gets us between two opinions different ideas just like he'll make us like gideon in a cave somewhere threshing weed in secret instead of driving the enemy off our inheritance hallelujah you know you know the bible says there's nothing impossible with man all things are possible to them that believe there's so so that means there's nothing impossible with the believer brotherham says in the patmos vision he says do you know man is omnipotent that means all powerful do you know man is omnipotent he says when two i'll just read this is amen cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the garden of eden that's why lord jesus did that down calvary cut every obstacle away to unite us and him there's nothing you know there's no chasm between god and the believer there's no bridge there's no chasm he he just fills the chasm amen he he rips down the wall i think it was i think it was reagan or one of the presidents said you know you know when the berlin wall was built or i mean there he went to berlin he said tear down this wall and that's what jesus did he tore down that wall between us and us and god amen there's no more wall no more hallelujah amen so he says here cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the garden of eden now man i was going to choke it but i'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe that but he is a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent so a man fully surrendered to god is all-powerful amen did not he said mark 11 22 whatsoever things ye say and don't doubt in your heart will come to pass you can have what you've said what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together to omnipotent something's got to shake whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met there he stands oh isn't he wonderful the prophet says she says that when two omnipotents come together something's got to shake though yeah and and then when a word a creative power of a word is spoken under that anointing though things may appear as totally opposite they will be changed until they become what is spoken i'm talking about you right now this is not next year this is not some other time this is right now this is what is in you right now it's not coming it's here i mean we don't need another messenger to come to finish the mystery of god in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god should be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets amen and that's already done that seventh angel has come and gone we have the jesus christ the word is with us now and he wants to open our eyes to show us who we are amen that we would find our position as believers hallelujah so if when two omnipotents come together something's got to shake a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent amen but the devil doesn't want us to realize we're all powerful i mean because if we realize we're all powerful the devil is totally defeated amen hallelujah i we might as well call our call all our names gideon amen can destroy literally anything hallelujah amen we're we are not of manasseh we haven't caught we haven't been caused to forget i remember the lord has come to make us remember where were you before the foundation of the world where the morning stars shatter for joy and all you're in my mind bride you're in my mind amen jesus said if thou cast believe all things are possible to him the believer that's mark 9 23 then mark 10 24 and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus answereth again and said unto them children how hard is it for them that trust and riches to enter into the kingdom of god then the next verse it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they were astonished out of measure this is the disciples reaction they were they are beyond astonished they are more than shocked they are astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved and jesus looked upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible i mean so with god all things are possible we may think something's impossible with god it's possible hallelujah now we are the word made flesh today right we are the living epistle of some word it can be either of the world it can be a philosophy or it can be the bible the message of the hour right the apostle paul would say in 2nd corinthians 3 do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some other others epistles of commendation to you or letters of combination unto you ye are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the hearts the apostle paul is telling them the word that we ministered you are now manifesting right so the word that was spoken is now being written in their hearts by the holy ghost it's being lived out of them hallelujah amen he says and we trust that we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of of god who also has made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so they were living the true believers in those days were living manifestation of paul's epistles right so when you saw the ephesian church i mean the ephesian church was a living functioning group before it was written off in the ephe you know in the epistle to ephesus right right they were functioning that way before paul wrote that letter the corinthians already had their trouble right before paul wrote that letter because of carnality they weren't like the ephesian church right but all the true believers down through the ages have become the living word for their day so what paul could have said is instead of reading these letters look at these people because they're manifesting what i've written in these letters amen and it should be the same thing with you and i where the bible is no longer ink on paper but when people see you they should be able to see genesis the revelation they should see the revelation of jesus christ contained in a vessel amen shouldn't it be that way if we are if we are written epistles written known of all men i mean not not with ink but by the spirit of god where the word has become flesh and you and i hallelujah amen brother ram says this in the masterpiece he says when we're living epistles or in other words we are the epistles that's living that's been written and now living out the word of god as he promised in the hour manifested word epistles written that's been living out that's what the apostles was that's what john the baptist was he was the voice of one crying in the wilderness he tried to tell them that he also was malachi 3 behold i see my messenger before my face prepare the way before the people he was that living word and the true born-again church in this hour is the living word of god it's the word of this age made manifest search the scriptures see what's supposed to be in this age there is christ living again just changing his mask from one to another amen he says in the same this is in uh oh this is the masterpiece now notice the bride if the bride in the beginning was the word or the bridegroom then if the bride is taken out of the bridegroom it must be the word also notice the bride must be why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one she's just a smitten piece off of him there is the masterpiece so if jesus christ our bridegroom is the word then the bride is will be the word also are you all following me tonight right so so if he was the bible made flesh so we will be the bible made flesh what i'm saying these thing is that we need to be we need to be i trust you're not like gideon threshing wheat just trying to survive through ladies see you and keep things to yourself and just hopefully the devil will be dealt with by someone and just trying to survive and no no we're gonna we're either our eyes should come open where we should realize by angelic visitation you're a mighty people of allah you're made to overcome as jesus overcame all temptation amen as he overcame all demon power or religious power all social power everything that was in the world came against him and he conquered hell death and the grave he overcame all those things he was the word and he overcame so the brightest she receives the word becomes the word and that overcoming power comes into her and she overcomes all hell death in the grave as well i mean why because he she is part of him so through him the apostle paul said i'm more than a conqueror through christ amen and he knew who he was we're here to know who we are amen uh remember this is how god sees you how you see you is probably very different to how god sees you we need to change it lord may we see ourselves as you see us as the scripture says that there will come a day when we are we know as we are known so as god knows us we shall know in the same way so if he knows me as a sinner sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ made his image wash the blood and lamb no spot or wrinkle or any such thing and there's nothing held against me you know the old account was sitting long ago washed in the blood of the lamb there's no sin attributed to me i'm a more than a conqueror through christ i'm an overcomer i'm victorious if he sees me that way lord may i know as i am known right because remember god does not change his thinking about you and i if god thought of me that way remember you know i think i've said it before i have you know where when jesus spoke to this age he said to him that overcometh will will sit down with me in my throne as i overcame and sat down in my father's throne when he spoke that to john on the isle of patmos he had in his mind who was going to be those overcomers it wasn't just a term he just threw out there and hopefully someone would meet the criteria he knew exactly who would manifest that scripture right so i pray god may i know as i'm known i believe i believe i'm one of those group do you believe you're in that number that blood wash number irrespective of how you know that's why we say lord change my thinking that i don't see myself as i see myself and my failures and my humanity and what's going on in my life and my personality and all those things don't don't let me look at myself like that let me look at me how you see me amen i think it's a good prayer to have then the lord began to open your eyes and say child your father you're worth your souls worth more than ten thousand worlds i mean my very purpose upon the earth is to gather you to myself and myself to reveal you know myself to you and walk with you and then fight your battles and comfort you when you're trouble and give you counsel when you're worried and you know give you rest when you're wary and heal you when you're sick and you'll guide you through all of life's journey do you know he is you know we are we are the purpose of his being his very heart you know you see people get tripped up with the godhead where it says in genesis how it says let us make man in our image and then when god is done making man in his image because that's how it's a purity there so therefore that shows the trinity no because when you see what god made in his image he made one spirit and then that and that and that one spirit man became one person but within that one person was a woman was his heart was was was sealed away but then that wasn't god wasn't satisfied with that he wanted to manifest his heart and then eve became flesh wasn't it different it was actually a part of adam coming out and becoming the woman hallelujah it's the same thing with you and i we're actually a part of god amen we're not just people that he's just kind of gathered haphazardly no he's been looking for his attributes looking for parts of himself and that's why when the word comes your way it speaks to you like it maybe doesn't speak to other people it's because god is trying to tell you one of my eagles you one of my children i want you a lord open our eyes that we would see and we would know as we are known amen i trust this is this is this is not going over your head you may say this is kind of but i see myself as this big well say just turn your vision a little bit and say lord show me who i am because remember what he says remember he is judge jury and executioner right what he says goes there's no there's no jury oh yeah i'm just trying to say it's not a democracy in heaven if he says the sky is going to be blue it was blue right and that's it you know it didn't you know there wasn't a war i think that's not right no no because he said it's blue right and if he's judged someone sinless virtuous no spider wrinkle against them then nothing can come against to say no hold on that's wrong the devil tries but the apostle paul says who can lay charge to god's elect that's god that justifies so what he says about you and i is the only thing that matters not what we say about ourselves not what the devil says about ourselves what god says amen now he says in the identified masterpiece of god he says now he's the word he he's always the same and your spirit has to punctuate that within with amen oh he in my way he is in every way he's the same yesterday today and forever now we notice that god began to make a bride for christ and the bride must be identified with him and in him because it's a part of him now the brightest part of him she is part of him the word for that day the bride becomes part of that word for it's christ now you believe that we have to be in christ in christ we have to be of christ in christ part of christ actually speaking about all the same thing there what is a woman when she takes a man or a man takes a woman that woman has to be part of him they're no longer two they're one and when god and christ has become one they were one because god pardon me was the word and the word was made flesh the flesh and the word become one and when the church becomes christ's bride she and the gospels are the same she and the gospels are the same so instead of reading matthew mark luke and john you can read the believer's life she and the gospels are the same how can you say that in the days of miracles was past how can you say then he's not the same yesterday today and forever how can you say those things is for the apostles or a disciple or somebody in another day when you're part of him amen are we all here today well i'm talking about you right because he said you say well well that's that's that's way out of left field no it's not because in ephesians 5 it says we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church or the bride because we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones remember if he overcame and we're part of him we're going to overcome right because his body is not going to do to do a different thing to to him right because we're one unit just like my head is connected to my body if there's a separation there'd be no life in either bit right that's not that's not crazy talk you know if there's a decapitation happen right now i'd be dead right but what my head does where my head goes my body goes right so if my head says walk over this way my body's going this way and vice versa back over here so if the lord conquered hell death in the grave and then he arose you know there's a song i was listening to ain't no grave can hold this body down and there's the bridge saying you know if you walk down the grave i'm walking too if you walk down the grave i'm walking too why because where his body and he's the head so if the head walked out of the grave i put it that way the body's going worth amen so nothing can hold this body down hallelujah amen colossians 1 and 26 would say even the mystery which has been hit hit from ages and from generations but has now had made manifest to us his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory now i just want to go quickly through how how how powerful real faith is now real faith is a revelation right it's not a hope so it's an oh so so it's not in here it's here it's when the word goes from here down to here and you know it's so right that's that's real faith now he says in the ever-present water from the rock he says now if there wasn't a law now now i just want to keep you in mind keep in mind i read in the beginning the one who made sun moon and stars is inner people right so the one who said let there be sun moon and stars isn't a people is it you and i it's not a different god unless a god the holy ghost is god right now that shouldn't be a shock to anyone he says now if there but there's a law that controls faith right if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of god could create them a world out there and go live a private life on it so that power's in you right now you may have heard this for years be gonna hear it one more time there's actually powering you to speak a private world into existence and go live on it we say let there be the milky way just like this one and then you just go from here onto that earth you're living a private life amen but see you have the power in you to do it right if you've got a shadow now this this really just struck me think about this if you've got a power of the shadow of god in you you've got power to do it so you can say let the wick say i am strong i mean let the wick say i'm strong so you ever say well i'm weak in faith no you're strong i'm just you know i'm just scraping through no you're strong because if you've got a shadow of the power of god in you you've got power to do it what's that create a world and live a private life on it god is omnipotent see what i mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it hallelujah there you are that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of commandments it's a law of faith jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatsoever god will lead your soul to belief then that is yours every place that the souls you've ever felt can sit upon by faith god gives it to you so it should be it lord lead me to believe all things amen amen see um god gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you you see what i mean that power is controlled by if you're a son of god if you're a daughter of god that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there hallelujah when you are saved god gives you faith to rise from the muck of the earth your faith overcomes the things of the world what is your faith your faith is that act that god has did in you to make your son of god you quit your lying you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because your faith rises you above it amen if you don't do it you don't have any faith and by faith you're saved and that through grace as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have because then you dwell as the power to make heaven as an earth god dwells in you and ye are sons and daughters of god amen there you are but it's your faith jesus says according to your faith beard unto you if thou canst believe all things are possible verily i say unto you if you sound to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you've said then what kind of people ought we to be having faith in this great redeeming christ that lives in us this smitten rock that never leaves the church i am with you always even to the end of the world the ever presence of the great gusher of salvation and power that poured fall from calvary into the church the ever presence of the living god the great flowing smitten rock that goes with us in our journey now what is this no um he said as much he says now if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you now what is this key that opens this to us he says and be as i be not afraid it says i believe that healing is a finished work that's been completed for 2 000 years when jesus died at calvary he saved you from sin and healed your sickness and every blessing redemptive blessing is yours by faith in that finished work it's yours if you can believe it so that is the key that opens up all these things faith in the finished work of calvary is the key to the door that opens every divine promise amen now faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god that's why it's very important we sit under the word we listen to the message read the bible because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word so if we hear the true word of god faith rises it doesn't go down it actually increases amen it increases that's what we want that the lord would increase our faith now faith has a lot of uh brother man describes it in many different ways he speaks when moses i'm just going to read a few quotes then we're going to then we're going to be done because time's run away moses with his faith never did fear pharaoh see he didn't care what pharaoh said he cared not about pharaoh no more than his mother and his daddy cared about their threats when moses was con what was confirmed to him and he was that person that would deliver egypt or let or lead israel out of egypt rather he never cared what moses said i mean so what pharaoh said he wasn't scared of him amen oh man you see what i mean there is no faith and there's no fear in faith faith knows about it remember faith is a revelation okay faith is as i've always said it's got great big muscles and hairs on his chest faith says shut up and everybody shuts up that's all i know where i'm at the rest him say well then maybe he does see but you've got to stand up and show your muscles that's all faith does it so faith tells our five senses to shut up don't listen to what you hear don't pay attention to what you see whatever symptoms you feel whatever memories you carry faith says shut up to all those things because faith just takes god at his word i mean so if there's no fear when god reveals it to you in faith he says this in preparation you believe it's preparation time don't notice your age don't notice the circumstances faith knows no age limit or circumstance faith knows one thing god sets on that settles it you believe it he says in the sin of unbelief the trouble of of it is with the church saying we come with hope instead of faith faith is positive faith needs no booster faith knows what it's talking about faith is strong faith has hairs on its chest it speaks the rest of them shut up symptoms can't even speak at all when real godly faith speaks it's got the flaw it knows where it's at it's had an experience and and faith is our victory he says real faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated that's why faith is prevailing revelation is prevailing i mean it cannot be defeated even death itself can't defeat it it knows no defeat trials no defeat but faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated and it's the only way that we can please god for that faith it's impossible to please god said hebrews 11. amen first john 5 and 3 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments as commandments not grievous and what's and whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god so our faith is actually the key to victory that caused us to overcome revelation amen he says in perseverance she was persistent she stayed all day the undertaker's calling for a baby now this is by the way i'm talking about the woman in mexico with the dead baby you know the baby died early in the morning but but you know went to the doctor it was dead but she got into the meeting got past all the deacons and the ushers and things because she know if she could just get to that man which was the prophet he would pray and the baby would come back to life so she was she had perseverance she was persistent amen the ushers tried to keep rather lined she stayed anyhow turned down every way but she stayed why she had perseverance why faith caught a hold faith faith said it's so and faith knows no difficult faith knows no defeat when you've got faith you have perseverance now you may have difficulty but faith doesn't know difficulty faith will take you through difficulty remember faith doesn't make it easy faith makes things possible amen faith doesn't take away obstacles but it gives away through the obstacle amen but we're going to be persevering whatever we're seeking god for we should keep seeking until we get it and keep knocking keep asking amen until you get what you have need of amen because remember faith is perseverant it puts a real backbone in a person puts a real anchor puts a real zeal in a real drive aiming that we'll get what we're seeking because why god has anchored in our hearts say lord i want to see it right now you may have given me the peace is going to happen but i want to sit back i want it right now lord just like caleb said let's go get the land right now let's go up right now and go get it why it was revealed to caleb the land was his hallelujah so the seraphinisian woman was this was was this kind of woman it's amazing you know it's amazing how faith goes beyond obstacle it says in matthew 15 and behold the woman of canaan came out of the same coast and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but she answered her not a word now some people would say well god just isn't listening to me maybe i don't have faith maybe my prayers don't work and that quit but she she had a real faith that was perseverant she wasn't gonna leave the presence of the lord until she got what she needed because she knew that he had the answer but he didn't answer her a word and the disciples came and besought him now this is this is matthew 15 23. if you care to put it up that's fine and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel in other words i'm not here to meet your need this was this was the lord's answer to this syria phoenician woman this this greek woman here i'm not come to you but she came and she worshiped him saying lord help me see she had perseverant faith this is gentile faith in action hallelujah and he answered and said it's not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs so this is not even for you and and he's calling her a dog this is what he is calling her so she's been ignored she's been told this is not for her and then she's been called a dog but but see her faith knows no difficult using the prophet's language from the previous quote and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table so she has been willing lord if you call me a dog that's fine but i still want what i want i still yo surely a little some of these blessings will fall down the table sure the bread's for the people you're the family for israel but hey i want some crumbs and sure some will fall i'm here where the master chef is i'm here to the lord himself you know who puts the bread on the table you know but she she said sure some crumbs will fall down i'm just gonna hang because i know even one crumb of the word amen will deliver my daughter hallelujah then jesus answered said o woman greater thy faith oh remember he knew what was in her he knew what was in her you know but she she she had to go through this time to realize my faith is great remember the lord wants us to realize what's within us beard unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour why because her faith was persistent if you have faith you have perseverance you will press it until you get what you want no matter if the lord doesn't appear to be talking to you if he even tells you this is not for you you know the devil tries to put that down our neck and many people believe him it's not for you oh it's not for me they go their way this is the lord himself telling her this is not for you but she said i'm here anyway i've turned up i want what i i want what i've come to get even a crumble do i'll take a crumb see this is her faith her faith did not know any difficulty hallelujah because she knew her he was more important than her current state out not even in the economy of god amen brother i'm saying calling jesus on the scene this greek had heard these words she believed it she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any faith knows no hindrance her faith had no hindrance she had but her faith didn't have you may have hindrances but if you've got faith it knows no defeat it's positive let's look at some of her hindrances just for a moment some of them might have been some of them might have said remember you're of a different race you're a greek sorry sorry phoenician by nation he's a jew in other words today they'd say your denomination is not having this revival it makes no difference your denomination whether it is or not that woman didn't care who's to know denomination it was she was a human being created by god and she had a need and she had faith and she was going to get it whether her denomination was cooperating not made her no difference she started off hallelujah he says in calling jesus on the scene genuine faith knows no defeat it's already done it's already over god see it so that finishes it you see god said so now it's the same thing any time when you really believe it that touches him hallelujah so gideon do you know who you are do you know who you are in the lord you say i've got a lot of difficulties no just let your faith rise because your faith will overcome those difficulties remember god doesn't take away the obstacle look at all the obstacles that the children of israel had from going from egypt to the promised land there's a lot of them there was pharaoh and his task masters there was pharaoh's armies there was the red sea there was the desert there was mount sinai there was the moabites there was the river jordan there was jericho there was ai there was all the amalekites the precious lights and the whatever rights of the land there was a lot of obstacles god didn't push them out of the way god said no no you go and take the lamb but i'll fight your battle so they had to they had to walk into the place god said he'll fight for you amen but he but they had to turn up but their faith made it possible hallelujah joshua's faith that he would take the people of the land didn't take the walls of jericho away but it made it possible then to fall down flat right but many times we look at the difficulties and we put them above our faith but if you've got real faith the difficulties don't compare to what god has said to you if god says the promise is yours don't matter what difficulties rise up because sure they'll rise up but your faith will take you through every difficulty amen why because two omnipotents have met and something's got to shake hallelujah something's got to shake amen it's not going to be you it's going to be the devil and he's going to have to get out in the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen we are made overcomers in this life through the blood of jesus christ amen queer the musicians please tonight amen let's not forget who we are the devil wants us to forget who we are but god has made us a different category of people amen amen i like it faith faith is here's honest chest and tells everything to shut up it takes the flaw it's it's the boss hallelujah amen amen amen it doesn't matter where you are in your christian journey you say lord i'm walking on hallelujah faith knows no defeat it'll know a lot of battles but it won't no defeat remember but the great thing is also we may lose a lot of battles in this war but we'll win the war so it doesn't matter how many battles you lose napoleon won a lot of battles but he lost the war right and he died as an exile but he lost the war the devil may win a lot of battles but he ain't going to win the war keep pushing on amen let's um stand tonight shall we let's sing set your wings to to the winds of faith i mean let's just sing this tonight shall we there are two roads you may take one by side and one by faith amen but set your wings to the winds of faith [Music] you may one by side one by faith take the word of what god see what you believe is what will be oh set your way to the winds of faith you will fly to a higher place [Music] set your wings to the winds of faith [Music] watch your mountain [Music] it will move or you will fly oh set your wings set your wings to the winds of me will fly to a higher place set your wings to the winds of faith oh watch the eagles in the sky he does not struggle and he does not strive for the power that makes him rise [Music] [Applause] is to a higher place [Music] set your wings to the winds of faith what's your need what's your need oh what's your cry oh watch your mountain [Music] it will move or you will fly set your wings to the winds of faith to a higher place set your wings to the winds of faith set your wings to the winds of faith you will fly to a higher place do not struggle it's by grace set your wings to the winds of faith hallelujah amen just set your wings to the winds of faith amen i think we sing that song the battle is the lord's when the roads you walk leave you tired and worn all your strength is going on your heart is torn you heard that song the battle is the lord amen there we go amen are you glad that we're tapped into that source the lord jesus christ amen amen there is a source in times of needs that gives me hope that brings me peace [Music] my savior stands [Music] [Applause] all your strength is gone and your heart feels strong remember god is greater than the soul take [Music] [Applause] [Music] he calls my name [Music] i [Music] [Applause] me [Music] [Applause] is [Music] and when the rust he calls my name out on the way [Applause] me [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is amen hallelujah amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer lord jesus i just pray to god as we continue to walk with you may continue to open our eyes to who we are in you oh lord i pray father as as we read in the beginning the devil wants to push us into a corner make us be some cow down little something but lord we're not there we're believers lord you've made us believers you've made us overcomers and may we know ourselves as we know you may we not look in the mirror and think of ourselves as what we see in the mirror of god as lord as a gauge of our our our uh lord as as how you think we are because just like gideon lord he was hiding away in a cave threshing weed in secret the enemy was all around him but when you came to him oh god you told him that he was a mighty man of allah you told him to go in the power of his might lord you didn't say he would become a mighty man of valor you told him he was already a mighty man of allah and i believe that's the same thing lord with us as believers here we already are overcomers lord jesus because of what you have already done for us you made us to be overcomers you made us to be mighty men and women of valor lord jesus through exploits in your name so lord i pray we would know as you know us o god and we would not know ourselves as we think we are but lord may how we see ourselves match how you see us oh god as overcomers lord jesus the devil under our feet more than conquerors through you washed in your blood no sin held against us lord made in your image lord please may we see ourselves in this way we love you so much oh god we thank you that we are your workmanship lord jesus this is nothing that we could lord as you said when lord in the days of your flesh not one man can add a cubit to his stature lord it's you who makes a people lord jesus you that washes us you that calls us you that justifies us and sanctifies this lord and glorifies us lord god we are your workmanship lord jesus we are the clay and you are the potter so may you continue to mold us and shape us may we feel lord your hands oh god on our clay as you molest and shape us more and more into your image please make grounder for your glory i want to thank you dear god that truly lord you who made all things dwells in the belief you dwell in us oh god i pray father you just give us a real a greater revelation oh god of what you've done for us dear lord and may we walk according to that faith in the name of jesus christ may we be like the seraphinian woman whose faith knew new hindrance it knew no hindrance at all o god though she had hindrances though she had difficulties but her faith took her right through all of those things until she got what she had need of the lord you see we have many needs in our lives oh god many many questions many many wayward loved ones and friends and family want to see come and many promises of god we want to see manifested lord i pray father our faith may you anchor it into our hearts in such a way that lord our faith will take us through all the hindrances and difficulties lord until we get what has been promised us lord because we know that lord has been given into our hands already we thank you dear god we pray your blessings lord i pray your blessings upon the congregation here both here lord and the unseen father i pray you be the abundant portion o god in the name of jesus christ want to commit ourselves into your hands may he give us journeying mercies as well fathers we're going to the rest of the week may watch over us oh god in the name of jesus christ we ask amen amen amen let's just finish with i'm amazed that you love me i'm always amazed that he loves me amen no one knew how alone i was feeling and the emptiness i tried so hard to hide [Music] though i laughed and said my life was fine without you i was covering up the secret tears i cried then one day someone told me of your mercy and the love you showed on a hill called calvary oh there you [Music] dream oh i'm amazed that you love me [Music] and my sins [Music] yes it's true there have been days where i failed you lord you know the many times i've gone astray but i've learned that your love is stronger than my weakness and your ear is open every time i pray no one else has ever cared for me like you lord other friends could never be as close to me i'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow knowing you are everything i'll ever need yes i'm amazed that you love me [Music] oh how you came through your precious and my sins they're washed they're all washed away all my sins are oh i believe that you love me oh i believe oh how you care that you care through your precious luck i found pardon and my sins are one all washed away all my sins are washed away hallelujah you believe that amen god bless your friends you dismiss in jesus christ's name [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] i believe in a hill called mountains [Music] and earth [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] i believe in a hill called i believe whatever [Music] and when time has surrendered [Music] [Applause] [Music] this [Applause] [Music] i'll still cling to this you
