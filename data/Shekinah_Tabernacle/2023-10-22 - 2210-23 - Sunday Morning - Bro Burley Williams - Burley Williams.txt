angel of this day come out of her my people come up hither we thank God for that amen praise the Lord I just thank God for the message of this hour uh what have done to my life people can say whatever they want to say about it I just know what it did for me come on Amen yes sir amen just like Ruth in the Book of Ruth you remember when Ruth went to Boaz he said who art thou my daughter she said I'm Ruth and then when he told Ruth what he's going to do make a plan for her Ruth went back home to her mama mother-in-law and she said who are thou my daughter Ruth didn't didn't identify with her name she the Bible said she just told what the man said am and that's the way I feel I can only tell you what the mess is done for me who are you Ruth we just only to say what God spoke to us how God changed our lives amen God touched us changed our hearts I'm so thankful for that can we say Amen it's amazing how you can stoop so low down in sin and then God can come and change you is that right and always say to the young people don't be curious about what sin is and how close I can get to the world and have an experiment experience you don't have to do that you hear many testify God delivered me from this and God delivered me from that God changed me and then sometime you can sit I ain't really done nothing in life what did he delivered me from I haven't done nothing where is my testimony your testimony he delivered you from doing it now that's right amen cuz he is still he's a keeper can we say Amen some of us go through hard times in life you God still give us a testimony but you still can have a testimony he kept me from doing it he stopped me from doing it can we say praise the Lord so we all have a testimony yes sir amen thank you musician let's give our musicians a [Applause] hand amen praise the Lord did you enjoy the word last night let's give our brother a hand amen praise the lord we didn't we didn't we didn't come here to debate we come here to Worship the Lord the enemy is the devil we're not uh we're not the devil the enemy is the devil we wrestle not against flesh and blood be strong be vigilant for your adversary not your pastor not your wife not your husband not your children the devil can we say amen that's the one we need to go after the devil praise the Lord so if you will um I don't know what I have a lot of stuff but um I'm I'm trying my best to get to that sermon that I told you about uh Lord have mercy reasoning I'm going work my way to it but we turn to galatian 4 I'm going to try my best to get there Galatians chapter 4 and I want to go to verse one this is a very familiar scripture it's one of the worst things you can do when you have to minister is talk to other preachers and you sit at the table and you talk and you tap they tap into your sermons like me and brother Adrian going at it and he tapped and I said Lord have mercy but still I have to just preach you know amen so galatian chapter 4 verse1 now I say that the heir as long as he is a s child differs nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is on the tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father amen verse verse three even so we when we are children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that was under the law that we might receive the adoption of son because you are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying oh my father wherefor verse 7 said wherefore Thou Art no more servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ let's read verse 7 again wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son amen and if a son then an he of God through Christ may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated it and uh Lord I pray that he would help us and it's good to see my my friend brother Paul Mett I love that man praise the Lord God bless you Soldier just was good to see him and shake his hand uh uh my first time coming to New Zealand brother Paul invited me here he got me to come so we've been coming ever since I can't I remember how many times I've been here but we just thank God for his grace and mercy I enjoy your heels and the and the sceneries and so forth but uh New Zealand is too quiet for me and uh we we like a little not spiritually not not spiritually now naturally uh I can I I I like it but you know when we from a Little Noise We just like a I like to hear [Music] cars just that's just I'm from you know so but praise the lord we just thank God for his grace and mercy I I I I do want to I'm still going to try to get to that service service but uh uh I was reading this morning something that's come up also on my heart and and I want to talk about growth how that we grow and how we mature in things that we go through in life and uh I want to TU a thought uh language language to the bride and a subtire is servants and Sons because there's a different from a servant and a son is that right you know we don't lose make no difference what we go through we don't lose uh I was just thinking how God does things in reverse and uh how the devil thinks that he's getting ahead of something and God just flips it and change it back around I thank God for that you know uh Adam uh Adam raised the devil's son he raised him is that right I promise you somewhere when Adam looked at Abel and he he looked at Cain as they begin to grow I'm pretty sure he begin to like yeah they're different but he raised that guy son and the and the boy that he raised caused problems in the house yeah he raised somebody else's son and it caused him problems in his house amen God said I'm going to do the same thing as Adam raised the devil son God let Pharaoh raise Moses on God said I'm going to reverse it and then Moses caed problem for Pharaoh's house is that right see that's how God do things God let the Pharisees raised Paul is that right God let the Pharisees educate him give him all his schooling and all those things then God turned it around then Paul caused them problems can we say praise the Lord he does things in the reverse God let the world raise me God let the devil raise me now I took everything that I learned from the devil switching around now I cause the devil's problems so we don't lose we just don't lose I just thank God for that and I think about those things a lot how that God just does things so wonderfully praise the Lord you know uh as we grow um and and and and we going to just maybe deal with some things and and I pray that the Lord would help us because these things are serious is that right and I like preaching to the young people because you got to you got to go there and then plant the right seeds that when they get older they'll come back I remember certain things and we got to do those things is that right and there's so many uh unbalanced things around the message but that's okay because I believe there is a balance is that right and and and uh we're in the season of balance how God is balancing everything out amen and I and I like that amen I it's good to see young people uh grasping hope to not just the letter of the word but the life of the word and seeing their lives change and it's Wonder ful to see those things Amen to see uh young girls turning to ladies and young boys turning to men uh the gospel can change you do you believe that and and I'm thankful for that and uh I'm not a Critic and I'm not don't trying to be critical but I like to be honest and just lay things out the way it's supposed to be I like for a man to be a man and a woman to be a woman that's why we teach the young boys you need to be a gentleman is that right don't play with girls emotions don't play with girls feeling be a gentleman amen the prophet warned us about those things how a young man is supposed to he said remember that is a daughter of God can we say praise the Lord you know down through the years I hear preachers talk about sisters need to be virgins sister need to be virgins let me tell you too boys need to be virgins too can we say praise the Lord they need to be vergins too praise the Lord not go out there I like the quote that the brother L brother Isaac read last last night the prophet don't go out there trying to se your Wild Oaks and so forth come on now he said don't be doing that praise the Lord amen the message came to keep us and rais up a generation can say God kept me uh my son got married six months ago and uh uh a lot of unbelievers was at the funeral a lot of them was there on the uh his wife's side and uh when they come up to the Altar and so forth and and I and I just made a statement I said I just want y to know they've been in courtship for 5 years and today is the first day they kiss on and people like I said yeah it's possible it's very possible I said this is the first day they lips would touch in five years of courtship these things are possible if you keep God in the midst can we say praise the Lord that's why you got to be careful brother and sister young people uh treat a woman a sister like a lady she's a sister in Christ he's a brother in Christ don't get anxious about things don't get curious about things because these things are precious if I ask you young man why do you want to get married what are you going to tell me what is your answer what are you going to tell me why you want to get married tell me why why you want to get married then you going to say well uh I'm lonely okay are you lonely like Adam was lonely can we say Amen wasn't Adam lonely but he wasn't lonely for sex cuzz that wasn't in his mind that wasn't in his vocabulary he was lonely for companionship so why do you want to get married is it physical spiritual ask yourself these things as we go through the service because it means something amen I I take those things personally when a young man decides to La a man's daughter let me tell you something fella you you got to come right you got to come right you can't come unbalanced you got got to come right you can't bypass the man don't talk to the girl we her hard then once you get her hard now you want to talk to the father that ain't the way it works can we say praise the Lord you got to approach the man approach the father and I always tell young girls if you don't have a father you got a pastor you got deacons you got Elders in the church because we got to watch these things guard these things because I've seen I'm it hurts my heart to see so many young people get married and then six months they're not married it don't work something went wrong somewhere can we say Amen that is not what this message supposed to produce it's supposed to produce Sons and Daughters of God that's what it's supposed to produce and I believe that amen uh I just like I'm just kind of relax my spirit so I'm just talking amen just got to talk to try to get into a channel that just the way the way that it is and uh but you know it's a family camp and if you want a strong Church you got to have strong families because that's how it starts amen but you know we have to grow and uh uh none of us uh when it comes to serving the lord uh just that just the same as a child it don't start out walking they have to crawl and so forth same with Christianity we grow but we have to see a progress I want to see myself growing more today than it was yesterday I want to look at my spirit look at my life am I closer to God today than I was yesterday that's the way I look at things and that's the way I want it to be but I want to just uh if the Lord would just help us uh uh uh servants and Sons that is totally different things is that right but God want us to be Sons now you can start out as a servant but God intent is for us to be sons and that takes time and it takes training for those things to happen but but my thing is uh language we are identified by language how many you know the bride is identified by language you go to a denomination of church and saying I feel the pool they'll look at you like you go to a denomination church sing I'm going to step into my theop and they'll be like what are you talking about because they don't understand our language we have a language God has given the bride a language and we understand that language can we say praise the Lord so as we go through these things cuz language it changes as you actually grow language change as you grow can we say praise the Lord I always tell the young people if you want to know where you're at if you really want to know where you at listen to your parents' language how they talk to you and you'll find out where you're at some of you looking at me like I fell off the moon somewhere I'm just telling you the truth we are identified by our language how how we speak how we talk back your speech give you a away same as Peter his speech gave him away he couldn't hide it they say oh you want you you with Jesus he no see your speech gives you away can we say praise the Lord so when we conversate with one another me as being a pastor I listen to how people talk and I want to pick up their language to find out what's is in their heart and where they're at sometimes people when they're discouraged in their heart they try to use a different language from their mouth that they're happy it won't work can we say praise the Lord it won't work you're trying to trick yourself that you're happy but down in your heart you know you're not that won't work and you can discern those things but notice when when everything is all right and your heart no condemnation your language speaks a certain way a person can feel this is a free person this is the person that is not under bondage can we say praise the Lord all right language from servants to Sons because it's different this this message come we believe we're in the adoption season how many of you believe that I believe that with all of my heart we in that time now of the maturing of the Bride let me just read a few things to you if you don't mind uh which I have a lot here but let me just I want to just show you something if the Lord would just help us this come from uh uh adoption part three and and and this sticks out to me he said Jesus was training 12 men that through those 12 men was to take the gospel to the world he said father for their sake I sanctify myself make yourself for your neighbor's sake for somebody else's sake don't use your Liberty for a cloak said Paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to let your communication be if you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do now the placing the sun first thing after the son was in he became a son but then we find out his behavior is what set him to adoption whether he behaved right or not so Behavior has a lot to do do with adoption which would be character can we say praise the Lord but I want to just point out something when he make the statement Jesus was training the 12 all of the time when Jesus the disciple was walking with him he was training them because he knew they going to have to carry on the work after he depart they are going to be the one to be the representatives of him so he had to train them to be exactly the way he want them to be can we say praise the Lord you see what happened God had to send a prophet in this day to bring us back to the true revealed word the life of the word can we say amen he had to do that first knowing that there's going to be Ministries to come after that that's why the prophet said it's important to only say what the messenger had said because we're identified with him that's why we don't add don't take away because the pattern has been laid so all these things is trainings even in brother benham's life his failures his faults all of that was just training can we say man his ups and down training you see in the midst of his ministry how he began to listen to different men and get himself in trouble with God he leared from those things can me say Amen but you will find after the seals you don't find brother Brandon being persuaded by men worried about the feelings of man he been through those things but that was just a part of his training can we say praise the Lord and we go through those exact same things of training amen but when he talked about the disciples amen training the 12 I want to just go if you will uh let's go to markise the Lord if I can find it right quick we'll read a few scriptures here y'all just really pray for me because sometimes it get pretty difficult with vision but we keep pressing on just like now my scripture um I want um I think it's Mark uh hold on one second matter of fact it's Matthew let's go to Matthew 16 Matthew 16 I want to go to I don't even think that's my I'm sorry I'm looking for the scripture when he fed the 5000 but it's a certain one I'm looking for y'all ain't in no hurry are you just pray for me Matthew 14 let's try that one want it go to Matthew 14 and let's go down to uh verse 14 I always go to this scripture for a reason and uh to show how when brother Brandon said he was training his disciples I take this personally when it deals with Ministry because Ministry is important every one of us ought to be thankful when you have a pastor that'll stay with this message and has a balance of this message you ought to be very grateful and thankful cuz those things are sometimes very rare where somebody can has have a balance of this word and uh I appreciate brother Ben he's a he's a he's a young fell but he thinks old I'm saying that with a compliment I listen to his language I say he thinks old but that's I praise the Lord I thank God for that that means maturity because maturity what matures you is the word is that right you see when when you when you come to things in the scripture now my mind is going everywhere now when you come to things in the scripture we got to understand the terminology even Jesus when uh remember when they brought the children to Jesus they brought children to them and the disciples tried to discourage that Jesus didn't like that Jesus said except you come as a child you can't even get into the kingdom he he he he he applied using a child about getting into the kingdom why didn't he say teenager why didn't he say adult he said a child he used that for a reason because a child and he used the nature of a child because a child want to learn a child want to receive so that's what he used we got to approach Jesus as a child see in the Bible language how God looks at maturity is different the way we look at maturity because sometimes in spiritual things a man can think he's a man but yet he's a I mean an adult but yet he's in a child and then you find God would put a child in an adult situation for instance Josiah was 8 years old God let him be a king Daniel was 14 years old carried down into Babylon but look how mature Daniel was you remember the prophet said Daniel when he went down in Babylon he was between the age of 12 and 14 but look what Daniel was able to do he said OED from his family don't have a church to go to but he sat down in Babylon with one quote book The Book of Jeremiah and he overcame Babylon Babylon was not in Daniel Daniel was in Babylon but Babylon never could get into him because he committed himself to one quote book and that brought him out of Babylon now if Daniel can take one book of Jeremiah and be Overcomer how about the over 12200 messages that God have given us in this day we can overcome this l c and AG you see that's the way God looks at things amen can be a child but now I like even in the scripture as you go down Jeremiah he was a young man in the time of Josiah Jeremiah wasn't old he was around 18 but look what God did at that age said I have placed you over the Nations when you look at those things young people out to Jo that you don't have to wait to get old to get a commission from God you don't have to wait to get old to start timeing to ser and God can take hold to your life at a very young age God can do that and he done that amen and then you find all down through the scripture how he used young people put them in adult situations and then when Paul talked to the Hebrews which was Men He said you are like children you the one need to be taught you're a bunch of babies not Paul calling grown men babies that's Bible language let me tell you something brother and sister I always come as a child when you're dealing with the Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you a person can sit in church all their life and be 60 70 years old and then when God finally touched their heart when they come down to the altar they can't come to the altar as a man they'll have to come as a child and say father here am I speak to me I'm learning I need something that's how you and I got to praise God we have to face God the same way as a child when You Face God as a child when he anoint you give you your answer you'll walk away like a [Applause] man amen that's how he does things but we are called for a time of maturity excuse me let me slow down just a little bit and here in the scripture let's go down to verse 14 Jesus went forth saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now passed send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and by themselves victuals verse 16 but Jesus said unto them they need not depart give you them to eat isn't that interesting Jesus telling them you feed those people he's telling them to do something he know they can't do he's training them he know they can't do it but he said give them something to eat what was Jesus doing he's dealing with Ministry letting the Ministry know up front you can't feed the people you can't do it watch his next step can me say amen he said and they said unto him we have but here but Five Loaves two fishes he said bring them hither to me otherwise Jesus know they can't feed the people then they show Jesus this is all I got then he said now give me what you got he's training the ministry can you say amen that's why when I come when I get the realization when I got understanding God I can't feed your people but you gave me a gift so now I'm going to give the gift back to you the same as they gave Jesus what they had we give the gift back to God can we say Amen now watch what Jesus does here it he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass took the Five Loaves the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blast and break and gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude see the beauty of that when Jesus broke the laws he didn't give it to the people he give it to the disciples then the disciples to the multitude that's the same with Ministry God I can't feed your people but I give you the gift that you gave me back now you give me a message and I'll take what you give me and I'll give it to your people that's God changing in the ministry [Applause] that's why the prophet say every one of us got to master that human ability that we can do it we think we can handle it no we can't do nothing without him anointing us because God does not want you and me to be under uninspired headship uninspired leadership he want us to be uned by him praise the Lord and here's the beautiful part about it prise Lord as they fed the people verse 20 they did eat and were filled took up the the fragments that remained 12 basket full and they they had eaten were about 5,000 men besides women and children this is what I love even most after the disciples done fed the people what Jesus gave them what Jesus multiplied they fed the people and then he says the straightway Jesus constrain his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him to the other side watch that next verse while he sent the multitude away oh I love that right there brother and sister after they finished done their part Jesus said now I'm going send them away that's the same thing with Ministry I give what God gives me I preach and I do what Jesus said get out of the way now I'll send the people away your pastor can't go after the service your pastor can't go home with you can we say Amen but after the service Jesus said I'll see the people away you done your part now let me continue to minister to them what you have preached to us God can go home with you God can be anywhere where you at still minister to you the things that you heard but he's training he's training the ministry and I believe we as time goes we as ministers begin to realize more and more and more I need something from you God to give to your people not my own ways and my own thoughts I need something from you how many of you believe that tonight this morning amen rather now let's just keep going in adoption three he said God trying to place his church in position to manifest hisself getting one that he can work through like this there's my spirit flowing freely there it is get another one over here and can place him I can place him adoption placing him manifesting take him out here and put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel this is not just for preachers hello look at the adoption message I when I first come the message I was taught that this really was for preachers but I found out that is not necessarily so how look what a prophet done even in the adoption message start talking about [Applause] Housewives me say Amen housewife putting things in there let you know every one of us got a position everyone of us got a place oh my friend think about it in that story the brother B told it was a woman sitting in a service God was telling her to pray pray for a child she wouldn't do it but God wouldn't stop pushing on her he kept pushing on her and then all of a sudden she said I'm sure she got a prayer call or whatever but God kept pressing and then what did God do she kept pressing the sister then she said sister can I pray for your child then she prayed for the child but then the woman still came to the prayer line when she came to the prayer line the prophet said your your child is okay he's already here said because that sister back there she said he said you didn't want to pray for her because of respect for me he said but you are a mother your prayer will be better than mine cuz you are a mother praise God so sisters has the part twoo but God want us to be in order so that character could be right so that power could be there so he can use us the way that he want to use us it takes maturing praise the Lord I love this placing manifest take him out there put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel tell him something now he's told the truth if he's just making up something it won't work that won't work we had a lot of that but I mean manifestation of sons of God when God manifest himself sends him out then he goes forth what he says is truth what he does is truth what he does he manifest Christ he said oh my that's the way it supposed to be when God send you when he send me he backs us up truth backs us up because we become ambassadors of Jesus Christ that's why we don't worry about what the circumstances are because our perfect faith will Master the circumstance when it try to comes up to [Applause] us praise the Lord I want to show you something and this is important how God speaks to us individually praise the lord I can't help but smile cuz thoughts keep a thought come my mind I tried my best to show you something natural that's applied to the spiritual there's things we we we go through through every day in life God is speaking if we just listen he's actually speaking let me say praise to Lord how many of you young people how many here under 21 years old 21 and younger raise your hand amen praise the Lord now parents you might want to you might want to close your eyes parents how many of you children wish your parents language would change and won't to say certain things to you raise your hand see you got some you got some being honest how many you like your parent you know your parents say something you be like there they go again how many of you would like that to stop come on young children W you don't you want that to stop hon be honest do you know how to stop it can I tell you how to stop it you [Applause] [Music] grow that's how you stop it as long as they are repeating to you the same thing that means you're not growing than brother thank you listen Young young people when you're young growing we expect a little battleship but when you get older we want Fellowship we want to fellowship with you before you leave home not fight the whole time but you control that language I'm get to my mess you control it but ISAC where you at your language don't changed can I explain it to you when you're single you just got a language but then when you get married it's just you and your wife your language actually changes right you and her hey sweetie just you heard y something about you right right but then when the baby comes the first one language change oh yeah you go ooh you see a man start acting strange he be like oh look poy poy P right no not being comical I'm just trying to I'm trying to show you something natural but who is changing the language the baby the little fella the little fella wets his pamper you go o let me change it for you you change it no problem you're just talking to him cuz his language then things change then all of a sudden the husband be like can we have a little date then the wife go oh no I can't he said could your maybe your parents could watch him she said go oh no that's too young tell Daddy it's too young you can't be going out right now and then Daddy be like but we used to she said no we we it's it's the baby then there's a man at careful here look at that baby look you little interruptor if he ain't careful now cuz somebody else don't comeing to the house so the language is changing then as the baby grows it grows and the language change you know when he start crawling language change right all of a sudden you go no when you tell that child no then it'll stop it what is doing is said no no it's trying to say now say this is a different language what do they mean by no so then it'll go re you go no you then he no then he go no he's learning right and then hot you say no hot he'll go no then you say no hot he'll just say no and then when you turn your head he'll go he'll go hot so it'll take an experience for him to understand that word see when he begin to do things your language changes as he goes cuz he's controlling your language so it's the same thing with you young people as your parents speak to you is identifying your growth can we say Amen when you hear your parents constantly saying really you got to be kidding me haven't we talked about this haven't we been through this really that's a sign you're not growing because you're hearing repeats language it changes as we grow that's why God we see in the Bible All Through The Years Seven Seals it been been there all through the years Church age all that been laying there but no I didn't understood that language to this time am in the time of Wesley I mean in the time of Luther the just shall live by faith has always been written in the Bible but it came in a lot at time amen that God was there start a Reformation he anointed Luther then that word comes off the page he said the just shall live by faith but it always been there right then that became a language of that day but then the seven is the Revelation 10 always been in the Bible but in this time Thessalonians about the Rapture always been in the Bible but this is the age all of those scriptures have been magnified because God had to send a message to let you know it's time for the things that been written to step off of the page and step into a body of [Applause] Believers so the language changed what's so beautiful in Genesis in Genesis look at God's language all right he would say it's good it's very good that was all God's language how good things were God never asked a question until after the fall that's when his language change Adam where are you what have you done see let me tell you something when questions are asked many times is a sign somebody got something in their life is not right because the question are asked to get a person to respond back to see where they at when God said where are you Adam he knew exactly where Adam was but he was asking the question and asking Adam that question so Adam can say no not where your physical condition Adam not where your location at in the Garden of Eden but now Adam where are you spiritually what done happen Adam where are you God language changed first it was good very good let it bring for for but when the fall took place language changed oh yes are you with me same as Church sometime you see your pastor he come and preach so humble so nice you say oh what a pastor then you come like by the next service like he just mad at everybody he be like what happened no something don't happened in the church now God said let me change that language a little bit to get their attention [Music] can we go on after the fall that's when language change God began to tell Eve he no he began to tell her in gen Genesis 3 unto the woman he said I will greatly mify thy sorrow thy conception and sorrow thou shallal bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee really in verse 16 really in verse 16 a person should see serpent seed just in verse 16 alone when people talk about want to know what happened in the Garden of Eden I don't just go straight say uh he had a relationship with a serpent I don't go there I ask them questions my question be I said can you answer this for me I said whatever it was whether is a fruit whatever took place can me you agree on something they say what I said children came forth they children you you're right I said God talking about conception they said that's right that's said you right children did whatever happened children came forth then I just flip it around so what fruit did they eat to make the children come then they begin to realize you can't eat a fruit to bring children ding it's that simple and we are thankful that we don't struggle with it we see it God revealed it to you but many struggle with that and the devil want them to struggle that cuz you can't catch the serpent seed you w you can't really clearly see the Plan of Redemption you won't be able to see it you won't be able to see the two Vines if you don't catch Genesis that's why the devil hates the Book of Genesis he don't want us to see his origin pray I just threw that one there turn me to John 13 John 13 I want y'all to just kind of go on a little journey with me in the scripture and then we'll bounce back wow I ain't even started 47 minutes verse one now before the Feast of Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world into the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end supper being in it the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his carrier Simon's son to betray him friends don't take this likly even when we reading this before Judas betrayed Jesus look at the scripture verse two it said it put it in his heart are you with me we we that'll get a little more uh clear in a moment because let me tell you I'll tell anybody when something comes into your heart in this eror you need to get it out that's right because once it get into when it come from the Mind get in the mind drop to the heart that's a problem and if you don't get it out of the heart you'll fulfill whatever was planted see that's how Spirits work don't play with them when you know something is wrong cast it down don't reason around it don't play with it wrong is wrong stay away from it that's why the prophet just gave us Lord have mercy he gave us the simple conclusion how to solve a problem he said if you got a question about it don't do it that's simple see the message is so simple to people stumble but the answers are so simple pise Lord verse verse three Jesus knowing that the father had given him all things into his hand and that he had come from God and went to God verse 10 Jesus said unto him he that is washed needed not Sav to wash his feet but it's clean everywh and you are clean but not all I want you to watch Jesus language now he's talking to his disciples but his language he's telling them you you you you you clean but not all because Jesus knew Judas was there the disciples they had no clue what was going on but we understand now because we can see the language how Jesus is using it watch this verse 11 for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean now let's go to verse 26 Jesus answered he it is to whom I shall give so when I have dipped it when he had dipped the sock he gave it to Judas is carried the sonon son of son he already giv them a sign right in front of f who it is sitting right in front of him but then verse 27 after the S Satan entered into him notice now the devil don't entered in first he put it in his heart now the devil don't entered in so that's why you got to be careful about the wrong thoughts and things don't let them drop down can we say praise the lord lord just got to be very very careful I'll get back to there another thought came but we'll get back to that listen verse 27 he said after the after the SOP Satan entered into him then said Jesus to him that thou doest doest quickly no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this thing unto him for some of them thought because Judas had the bag that Jesus had said unto him byy those things which thou have need against the feast that he should give something to the poor see you can come up all kind of ideas when you don't understand what the Lord is doing he did hav received the sock went immediately out watch the scripture said and it was night God is putting a scenery let us know at the time that the Betrayal take place in judah's heart is a night time can we say Amen now aren we in the darkest age so we're in the darkest age in the darkest time so that's why in this age it'll have to be a betrayal again of the revealed word something happened when Judas left something changed when Judas left and I'm going to show you in scripture when Judas left Jesus language changed and it was for a reason when Judas left Jesus Jesus could not well Jesus could not say let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe in me so I go prepare a place for you Jesus could not say that as long as Judas was there cuz he would have been lying when Judas left Jesus language changed to talk to his elect he spoke a language to his elect that he could not speak to Judas Hall are y'all with me some of you are I can tell some of you I'm I'm close keep going just keep going I'll get it I'll get it just hang on because this is important how God is speaking to his bride now he's speaking to his bride now in a personal intimate relationship he talking to you [Music] individually that's why God got to get things out of your life get F people out of your life certain situations out of your life so he can speak to you give you another [Applause] language John 13 oh Lord verse 31 where we at listen therefore when he was gone out Judas Jesus said now is the son of man glorified and God is glorified in him if God be glorified in him God shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him verse 33 Jesus said little children he couldn't say that when Judas was there Judas is not his [Applause] child his language changed cuz Judas had to go are you getting it friends you can hear all kind of voices but God want to speak to you but he got to get certain voices out of your life certain situations out of your life so he can speak to [Applause] you yeah a little while I'm with you you shall seek me and as I said unto the Jews where I go you cannot come so now I say unto you now let's go to John 14 all the things that I'm reading if you just take all of the scriptures when Judas left and then take all the read all of the scriptures in between until the time that he came and brought them roing them soldiers to Jesus in the garden just read all them chapters in there Jesus language is actually different he's talking to elect verse 14 John 14 let not your heart be trouble you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many manions if it was not so I would have told you I go prepare a place for you he couldn't tell Judas that now there is a place prepared for the devil but the one he's talking about is not for Judas and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again receive you un myself that where I am there you may be also that's the language to the [Applause] elect verse 12 verily verily I say un to you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Greater Works than shall he do because I go into my father and whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it he couldn't tell Judas this kind of language are you with me jump to verse chapter 15 I ain't going to hold you long I hope chapter 15 verse one I am the True Vine my father is the husband every branch in me that bears not fruit he taketh away and every branch that he bears fruit he Purge it that it may bring forth more fruit how many of you want more fruit you sure you do are you sure well get ready for trials God purges to make more fruit to come are you with me y'all are farmers up here you know you got a pers tree to get more fruit out of it that's why God let us be cut he let us be ripped he let all kind of things go wrong why he want more fruit who fruit his fruit his character his life that's why trials should not make you go down trial should make you go up amen I want to be like the children of Israel when Pharaoh persecuted the children of Israel you you know what made Pharaoh mad the Bible said the more they persecuted him the more they grew I want to be the exact same way the more problems the devil give me the more I want to go to church the more I want to pray the more I want to do the work of God I want to grow the devil cannot stand [Applause] growth [Music] amen John 15:14 I'm sorry one Lord I love this verse three he now you are clean through the word which I have spoken un you abide in me and I in you Judas is not there HL cuz Jesus know I'm not going to abide in you you ain't going to abide in me he some my language is to the elect this message is for the elect that's why we understand the language of this message praise the Lord let's jump down to verse 14 you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you for I call you not servants let's go back to galatian you're no longer servant you're Sons why is he telling them that now he said you get ready to change of dispensation now from a servant attitude to a son attitude which is a bit different he couldn't tell Judas that I just love this friend for the servant knoweth not what his Lord do it but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my fathers I have made known unto you aren't you thankful for that God don't make everything known to his elect why do God make things known to us because we're the children of Abraham when God promised Abraham when he was getting ready to destroy solom he said can I hide anything from Abraham the things that I'm about to do by you and I being children of Abraham if he didn't hide nothing from Abraham he won't hide nothing from you and me because we are the hirs can we say Amen he'll reveal everything to us that's why the books has to been open the seals had to be released he said I want you to know [Applause] everything can me say Amen a servant can't be a Heir a son can only be an heir that's why Abraham when God was talking to Abraham go Abraham said he said uh who where's my Heir he's the only one I got it the servant El as God said no your servant will not be your Heir but the one that comes from your own lungs would be your Heir that's why only your son can be an heir then when Abraham departed his Goods the Bible says he gave everything to Isaac but to the concubines he gave gifts but to ask Isaac he gave all that's why the churches they got gifts they got Miracles they got signs they got wonders but the bride got it all God had given everything to the Bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ [Music] amen he giv us everything he didn't hold nothing back he give it all people talk about yeah the the lid been torn out of hell but Heaven has also been emptied [Applause] too so Jesus language it changed because of the circumstance the same with you young people you'll know where you at by your parents language God praise the Lord let me drop this in young people be honest never tell a lie be honest I say this all the time but let's be honest cuz it'll take you it it honesty cause pain even honesty sometimes calleda disappointment but honest is Still Honest anybody that got any dignity at all will respect honesty whether you like it or not you respect honesty well at least you were honest brother B even said this he said well you don't like me he said what can I do to help you like me that's a mature man what do we say you don't like me that's your problem but look how mature he was he what can I do to help you like me praise the lord we talking about from servant to son yes it takes a character change God want to see himself in you and me he don't want to see other he want to see himself being reflected through you and me I want to go back to John 6 for a moment if you notice in John 6 Judas was there in verse 70 John 670 Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil now Judas is there now go to John 16 Judas is not there I want you to notice what he says yes we got to go backwards first don't John 15 I'm sorry and John 6 Judas was there he have I not chosen you he said but when one of you a devil but in John 15:16 he says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you notice it's more words though and ordain you that you should go and bring for fruit and that your fruit should remain he couldn't tell Judas that he let and Judas was there he said I chosen you and one of you a devil but when Judas is gone he said but I ordained you for a purpose total different language can we go a little further Lord the Bible says go with me to Proverbs 29 let's go to verse 16 it said when the wicked are multiplied transgressions increase but brandom used the scripture here in the message the ark he that's why he said cities the bigger the cities the more sin because it's more people people there but the righteous shall see their fall verse 17 17 correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yeah he shall give Delight unto thy Soul now remember when we read the scripture when it say correct thy son that also means sons and daughters so we can't be say oh all thing we supposed to do is correct man no it means both but he said correct thy son and he shall give thee rest rest why what makes it when you correct the son you correct the daughter what gives you the rest is when they receive the correction and they learned from that correction and now you see them growing that gives you rest you say now they are growing and I see that's right cuz there's nothing trouble a parent more when they see their child they can't see where the child actually at and they struggling and that that that that's that that troubles a parent cuz we want to know where the child what's going on what's going on that's what we want to know but in those times that's when Faith need to be high to realize go back to what the prophet said amen the same faith that you have for your salvation just applied to your family those things are hard to do but if you do what he said it'll happen God will save him how he's going to do it I don't know but he'll do it see some of you young people hearing me pleading for parents now you might be one in one causing them to go through something but let let me tell you something when you get older when you get children they start acting up you'll come back to the sermon that's why I tell young people plant good seed how many of you young people in here get up in the morning say mom dad what can I do for you today how many mom dad what can I do for you today how many of y'all do that you you married stand up Sister you better look at this [Applause] one I'm just being honest with you that's rare how many you young people got a job got a job how many you say Mom Dad can I help with the bills can I help

directions don't just say now get married I do kiss the bride now how I'm going to figure this out no you that's why while you're young talk to God about these things and then when you get married you

bride like that see we on a higher level than Esther huh the king promised Esther half of the Kingdom but God said you're HS of the Kingdom the king gave her half but God give us all so we go up higher husband pick up the wife phone password what's your password to your phone why do you need wh why do you need that if you ain't got nothing to hide what's the big deal [Music] de I'm so thankful when I go to the Lord Jesus Christ I don't say Lord can you give me the password so I can talk to you no I know how I can go to them [Applause] [Music] freely hallu what's your Too Faced book account number password couple of you called it Too Faced book you find out a lot about people on Facebook the prophet says this let me see what you post on your wall let me go into a man office whatever he post on this wall he said I'll know what's about the man when you post something on Facebook that's a wall you tell on yourself I preach the message a little while ago I titled it what's on the devil's mind hallelujah how many you know what's on the devil's mind who got Facebook in here I ain't going to preach on you them things are good and bad I'm just being honest on your Facebook account when you pop it open what do the first thing it says when you going to post something what's on your mind so whatever you post on Facebook is what's on your mind that's why the world is Satan's Facebook he posting this he posting that pictures here movies here he just posting posting post showing what's on his mind to try to contaminate your soul you got to be careful what you're watching what you're listening to you need to be careful never think you're so holy that you can just listen to anything and say I'm protected don't you never think that friends stay away from that stuff let me tell you something friends and I'm just going to be a little blunt if you can watch movies and listen to music with cursing and profanity and stuff in it you can do stuff like that you are not ready for a rapture even the dword say just the dword it's in the Bible I said yeah but not in that context are we all right this morning I'm just preaching just preaching see we got to change from a servant to a son and the only thing can do do that it's the Holy Spirit that's in you cuz remember adoption uh is uh the Holy Ghost is the tutor the adoption is the placing but it takes a tutor to put you in the place are you with me and that's going to happen cuz it've been predestinated we've been predestinated to receive the spirit of adoption so that gives me confident knowing somebody going to be there somebody going to come to that place cuz God has already predestinated to be let me you young girl say mama let me run this kitchen I'll take this week give you a week off you I'll cook I got you Mama I'll do it for you one how many of you boys dad let me take care of the yard take care of the farm I got it I got you you just rest have a week off Dad I got you I got you got one two he woo I'm telling you I'm just being real cuz these things are rare very rare because young people while you at home don't learn how to clean room up when you get married don't learn how to cut grass when you get married huh you got these boys get on these Video Games Live on them just live on them sister I'm sorry sir you married that one get ready to cut grass get ready to take care of the house cuz he going to Ste you what you don't done married PlayStation you don't marry Xbox that's what you married hour after hour after hour consumed when you can be laying in the word of God lord show me my purpose what you want me to be I want to be a man can I just show y'all some uh I'm just going to go through some quick examples of what a servant versus son is because you got to go back to galti it said the son differ nothing than a servant until the appointed time of the father because his attitude his maturity got to come for sunship and he Chang see what what you can do I'm asking a lot of question saying a lot of things when you can see transition from servant attitude to son attitude cuz it's a big different the difference between the sons and servants y'all just follow them Sons will build a house servants simply serve in a house a servant attitude I'm just an usher that's all I am but a son would say the church is of God I will assure that every need of the pastor and the people is met to the best of my ability but a servant attitude why I got to do it a son attitude will see something that need to be done need to be done and go do it but a servant will see the need but he'll sit back and wait for somebody else to do it it kind of like siblings and you got a couple of siblings the parent ask one of them to do something why why he can't do it why I always got to do why you can't get there they ask you to do it just do it see that's a servant attitude but when it's a son the parent a got to ask cuz he already don't seen it so let me take care of that Daddy come home said who did that I was just going to do that so I got I did it Daddy That's my boy I don't know how it is here but back in the States you get a lot of bar to cut grass as long as you got a ride in lawnmower let me tell you God know how to Humble you friends he humbled me all time I remember one time I got a new lawnmower rod and Lawn more you couldn't tell me nothing it's called a scy I even cut the neighbor's grass I got out there and cutting the neighbor's grass cuz you know that was a little sickly I'm just cutting the grass I got off the lwn more take care of your neighbor I was just oh yeah and then while I was walking with my chest stuck up the Lord said if you had a riding lawnmower would you cut their grass I said I probably would said do you want to borrow the lwn more cut your grass see it was easy to do it with the writer but when something a little more personal will I do it sometimes we want to take we want to say we sacrificed and we done something because it was easy we was able to do it you say I really done something no sacrifices when you ain't even got it to do do it but you still do it it's just like the Widow what she do she gave her all are we all right how many you can give me five more minutes how many you can give me five more minutes 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 40 oh I'm good I'm saying about 4 hours bring it up friend we have to grow a son a son attitude he would say this need to be done why not I I need to do it why not why I can't do it I'll do it that what the son would do but a servant would say that ain't my job that ain't my job why I got to do it are you with me just keep following them down when you dealing with even Ministry when a preacher got a servant attitude he'll try to reach for a Ministry to make something happen but a son await for his ministry hello sons are sent servant just go a son is sent with a commission knowing what he doing but a servant is just go and hope he can figure out what he's doing but that's not a son a servant attitude will split a family over a disagreement of issues servants will attempt to draw people people to his or her side but sons are interested in the father's agenda rather than doing his own thing are you with me praise the Lord see Saul was nothing but a servant that's right but David was a son Saul was only interested what people could do for him but David was interested in what he could do for people that's why Samuel gave them the prophecy told them exactly what Saul was going to do go read the scripture he told them everything if you look he said he'll make your son your daughters confiar he'll take the goodness of your cross he'll do all of this for himself and his servants it don't say nothing about what Saul would do for the people it's everything what the people do for Saul see that's a Saul Spirit you always want what people do for me for me for me but what about what you can do for someone else the prophet of God said eternal life is is living for somebody else a servant is all about me me me me me mine mine mine mine but a son know we ours so you can have a servant spirit in a marriage or a son spirit in a marriage servant spirit in the mar is all about you hurt me my feeling look how you treat me this look but never look how they treat the other but a sunship spirit in the marriage did I do anything offend you what can I do to help you oh my wife looking right at me I got no problem preaching these things from my wife cuz I got nothing to hide see the servant Spirit son Spirit can be in church marriage personal life it can run all the way [Music] down almost done a son is always interested in the father's AG jend sons are privileged servants sons have privilege they understand what their privilege is but a servant will always fight for rights you would never find David fighting for the throne cuz he know God gave it to him that's why he would give it up absolon him act up David just take off and go why he knew why should I fight for something when God said it was [Music] mine can we say amen that's the same as the Bride of Jesus Christ the devil I know what's mine so the devil can't take it away cuz we know what's been given to us can we say Amen we don't got to push ourself in some kind of position God put us in that position listen friends the more to much is given much is required right when your life grows you get add-ons in your life right I'm trying my best to quit when you grow addon come in your life when you're single if a man is single he can't say I'm a husband he can't rightfully have that title but when he gets married a title adds to his name husband girl wife right and way family structure is when something add to your life it adds to the family structure cuz when you become husband wife your parents become in-law right so it's adding to family structure now you're a husband and wife but you can't say parent cuz you got no baby but when the baby comes now you're parents right if you got siblings they become Aunts Uncles now the parents get another addition on their name Grand parents so the more you grow the more asss right praise the Lord the Apostle Paul you watch his ministry he'll say Paul servant of Jesus Christ then he'll say Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ he'll say Paul the age then he'll say Paul prisoner he realized as I'm growing I'm growing now I become a prisoner to the Lord Jesus Christ and then the prophet when he was preaching the seals he said I no longer call you church I call you [Applause] bride why it puts us up higher bride means a mature woman that come to a place have a husband Lord have mercy now I feel like preaching it's elevated in our lives where God had put us today no other age it been called bride been called church church but this age bride wife cuz this is the end Lord all right how much more time we got here you know being a son a son would build on a vision that his father gives him amen but the servant seek to build their own Vision the whole sum of adoption is being about the father's business that's the son I listen to brother Bron make a statement when he get up sometime he say Lord what would you have your servant to do today that's powerful to me I don't do that every day I don't but it should be that way Lord lead me today who you might have me to speak to uh witness to talk to would you help me Lord we're seeking we want to know what he wants us to do cuz our life is not our own are y'all with me this morning I'm what I'm speaking to you is bride language this don't work in denomination cuz they do whatever they want to do whatever they feel they Creed is that but the bride we can't be our own I'm closing when Paul said he was a prisoner to Jesus Christ if you go back to the message uh I think it's Paul a prisoner but B said Paul was sitting in the prison when he wrote that he said but what Paul did he be to look at Natural Things a prison life I can't go when I want to go can't leave when I want to go whatever they give me I have to take it he said then Paul went to another level with it he took it spiritually he said when he said when Paul wrote that he said I don't think Paul was talking about the prison that he was in he was relating to I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ yet I'm in a prison but not in this prison I am a prisoner to Jesus Christ he was able to take his surrounding and put it to himself to realize who he is somebody just asked me the question recently a trick question brother I'm confused aren't there Seven Ages I said yes why why are we preaching bride age see that's trick trying to find a trap in the message said I'm confused in my mind you ain't confused you just hope I can't answer your question I said listen brother let me explain something to you in brother Brandon's Ministry you first have to understand what he said he said each messenger comes at the end of their age didn't he say it he said they come at the end I said you got to understand his ministry I said he had to first come to the Pentecostals first I said brother Revelation three when Jesus was knocking at the door in the beginning of brother Brandon's Ministry that was that but when they rejected the ministry he's no longer knocking at the door he's saying come out cuz he's not trying to go in the pull amen he said come out of her my people he tried to when the prophet were going around the Pentecost trying to get them back to the word they rejected it right he said okay okay I said so brother when they reject it now it come to the other part of his ministry is to call out a bride I said let me tell you something friend I said the church age is all these things I but when it comes to the seal I said that ushers you and I to a bride age I said not only that brother we're in layer to sin age when you're not born again you are lay to sin I said but when I'm born again I'm ushering into a pride age that's why we're in this world but not of this world yes we supposed to be different if somebody was to ask you do you think you special do you know what your reply ought to be yes yes I am a royal priesthood I'm A peculiar people yes I am special in the eyes of God that's the attitude you're supposed to have and live above this world Hallelujah I guess got so much going on right now let me drop down I'm closing musician can come there'll help some of you out how many y'all know what the best Resurrection service are when the preacher say I'm F the clothes let some people alive in up about time musicians come praise the Lord only God could mature us to sunship the holy spirit it's nothing we can do ourself in galatian that's why it says it's the appointed time of the Father the Son could say Daddy I'm ready I'm ready for this Authority I'm ready for this position but no it's not in his hands it's in the father's hand I want to say something to the young people I I don't know what goes on up here I just know the devil is everywhere make no difference what country you go to the Devil he's everywhere but I do know this according to prophecy and according to scripture the way things are lined up some of the biggest issues young people have is movies music sexual things some of the biggest struggle have and they don't want to be honest about it but you truly be honest about it I rather for somebody to tell me a struggle that they have just be open with me instead of finding out some kind of way I just just be open are you with me but I'll say this to you you cannot play with spirits in the Book of Daniel when they was calling them to come to worship to the image of the Beast I mean the image that they had built what brought the call was music when you hear the sounds of the plasy the Tumo the trumpet did ads all kinds of music then you come that still is a part of the day even in the prophet when he had a vision of the bride and America they both was dancing yes to music one to rock and roll one was marching arm with Christian soier music plays a very part in this end time Hitler himself said give me the music that youth listening to and I'll gr I can win the youth he understand the power of it that's that stuff is nothing to play with that's why you go to different places music they play now back in my days you go to a shopping center they used to play instrumental music but now they play all kinds in there and then you could find yourself going home and just sitting at home not even thinking about it and your fingers start tapping or be in a restaurant your fingers start tapping then you catch yourself because science says this music is the only thing that can invade your subconscious without your permission it's music and many don't understand the power of music what it actually can do so there's all kind of music today see I used to be a dis jockey I can tell you a lot about music the stuff that I come out of and I can show you the trends and the changes of music what done happen today uh how music done evolved that you go and do your study on it in the Bible times when the the music was considered also Psalms they called it Psalms but then uh the according to history when the children children of Israel when they came out of Babylon they were strict they didn't want nothing but Psalms PSAL in the synagogue Psalms Psalms Psalms but then as a progress begin to go into the reformation and then it start turning to hymns they start calling it gospel hymns and then you got many they would just stay with hymns but then that's things start progressing up to the 70s that's when the word gospel music was starting to be add to music and they said that's where the problem came when they called it gospel music cuz now you can put any beat to it but label it gospel so then you get the R&B gospel you get the rock and roll gospel you get the Hip Hop gospel now heavy metal gospel and the of the devil is it's gospel listen to the words what the message is bringing forth I said no it's a whole deal I don't listen to none of it because I know the spirit that's behind it we're in the age of all kinds of music and it's a power to it young people if you've been doing things in your life you know that it's wrong but then whenever you God touch your heart and you want to start serving and then when everything get start going wrong for you that's a sign God is actually dealing with you but the devil want to shake you off the path you have to keep pressing on cuz Satan looking at I'm losing one I'm losing one I got to do this I got to keep pressure I'm losing one that's how the enemy works whenever you want to start serving the lord some of the things that you used to try to achieve that's wrong and you couldn't achieve it but when you start wanting to serve the Lord them achievement come back and then seem like you can have it now that's the devil trying to trap you are you with me I'll tell young girls whenever you you feel lonely not nobody want you or whatever but then all of a sudden you say God you want me I want to serve you and when you make that confession that I want to serve you Lord then here come Mr Prince pop up in your life what you think that is the devil son to distract you same thing with a boy girl you might like she never paid you no attention now you want to sell out to the Lord now she shows interest in you that's not God that is Satan realizing I got to do something to keep them are y'all with me I had a young boy I'm getting I'm finishing I had a young boy come to me in my own church bragging Pride brother bur I pastor test I said I'm happy for you what was the test he said this girl came to talk to me he said I told her I'm not interested I told her I'm young and I'm not interested he I noticed the language was Pride I asked him a question I said this girl that come to you was she attracted to you he said no I said that wasn't a test I said but if she would have been one that you drool over like you got to have her then you would have told her no you passed the test are you with me let me tell you something young people God wants you to have a healthy marriage healthy relationship but it starts with him first he can make those things work exactly right are you with me look you might get mad you might get offended at me that's fine but all texting that young people do amongst each other boys and girls and stuff I don't agree with none of that stuff because what it does is create Rel relationship through text there's no boy sitting in here has a right to communicate with a girl without consent of the parents Paul said let everything be done decently and in order if a boy can bypass your father and you marry somebody like that let you going to have problems in that marriage cuz that's a sign of disrespect a young man got to respect the father if he interested in that man's daughter he got to respect that man oh yes if the man ain't got a husband if I mean she ain't got a father he got to respect the mother and the mother by the grace of God I hope she would talk to the pastor cuz sometimes when it's just a mother and her daughter a boy take advantage of that cuz a man is not there to challenge [Music] him I through incidents like that I saw a young boy talking to a mama and her daughter just pretty bold just talking to cuz her daddy was dead I got him to myself I said let me tell you something fella I noticed how you talk to this girl and her mom I said that's not right he oh we just joke like that I said no sir I said the reason why you talking to them like that there's not a man there to challenge you I said but I'm the man I'm going to challenge you you don't talk to that lady like that you got to do things in order and that's just the way it supposed to be that's why young girl if a boy interested in you tell him talk to your father but if you're not interested in him tell him straight to his face I'm not interested don't play games say nope not interested if you keep coming say brother if you keep trying to talk to me I'mma tell Daddy on [Music] you because some boy will keep pressing a girl pressing with words words and you keep listening sister you'll break in break down for the words oh you can sit here and say I'm I'm too high level for that say that all you want to but the one that you think is so cute start talking to you huh them little ARS get big they get big I like what he saying I like uh no no no stay with the gospel stay with order stay with the word are you with me I had a niece take her life playing with a Ouija board them things are not fake they're Real playing with a Ouija board and I don't know about you but uh what it call a sounding board where they got these little jars and anybody know I'm talking about it's a called a sounding board you hit it and it makes a Melody that is demonic inspired my nie got caught up into all of that stuff and it cost her her life I speak things because of incidents and things I've been through and experiences stay away from certain things things music and all this kind of stuff look gospel music worship music what does it do to you if you want to judge yourself about music when you listen to it what does it minister to your soul or your flesh yeah it's going to minister one or the other if it pulling you to the Lord fine but if it getting into your flesh and make you really want to get down you better leave it alone how many y'all ever heard of a man called Kurt Franklin that man got the biggest Antichrist Spirit on him in any musician that I know of he does and he's the one that made that Twist of Music R&B and gospel all come together and yet sing some of his songs now the question come up you know all these singers and some of the songs that they sing then should we not sing them that's a good question but here's the thing you have to understand even though they are worldly people that gift they have in them is of God to write music but you have to be able to take them words but not their tune not their beat if the words line up with scripture but not get get into their Rhythm that's what'll mess you up I'm just trying to balance it out because you know cuz you can't you can't be uh deny the gifts but these things carry Spirits I'm telling you this from the depths of my heart I don't lost loved one because of music and things like that and there was nothing that I could do so be careful young people be careful of your friends be careful of the ones you hang around even in church just be careful if somebody you hanging around cannot talk about the word talk about the goodness of God how they want to grow and be more closer to Jesus and they can talk about every sport and every little thing everything a celebrity is doing that's really not a good person to be around cuz when they talk to you about them things it'll build an appetite in you to make you want to go Adventure I'm just being I'm just pouring my heart out to you stay in these tapes stay in this message let let more than your body be in church let your spirit be in church too listen to the move of God when God is doing thing take heed to those things that's my heart I'm just pouring it out to you can we give the Lord a hand amen all brother B you can come oh Lord willing tonight I I'll get back to my subject reasoning cuz that's very important the power of it if God
