clap hands for the lord is because you know i just i appreciate him [Music] because [Music] just a little bit the reason i use this little stand if i may rather than you know i thought as you said it's a old-fashioned prayer meeting tonight and so you're just gonna take it easy relax and each one comfortable and just allow the word to come through you easily amen so that's why i chose this one so that you know we can all be on the same level i would like to greet you tonight in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ how many are happy how many have eternal life amen so if you come to think of it the song that we are singing the lord jesus fed the hungry five thousand people he fed them i'm talking about the physical food now he fed them from two loaves and how many five fish he fed them five thousand people so how many are we here tonight one two three four five four we are like very few that food was going to feed us for i don't know how many years if it was given to shakina tabernacle but you know what the prophet says today we have been given a mountain of bread more than that one that was fed to the multitudes a mountain i don't know i don't know if you've got mountains here i believe in south island there's big mountains but where i come from these big mountains one of them is called kilimanjaro it's one of the highest in the world a mountain imagine a bread the size of mount everest man how long will you eat okay let's read the scripture and then we can sit down and relax i didn't prepare any powerpoint we're just going to read what the prophet says read what the bible says just three pages and it's actually two or one page if you just make them 11 font single sided it's actually one page because i have made them 14 and spaced up nicely so so so so it's actually small what what what i have here it's not too much and we thank the lord for this wonderful opportunity to be in the house of the lord this evening it's a serious hour that we're living in amen let's just read matthew chapter five we are living in a serious hour and a serious hour requires us to be serious amen matthew chapter five let's read mutual chapter five jonah wanna read with me my friend and then we'll read from we'll read from this three but our key concentration will just focus on verse six amen let's read it together when you read verse 6 i would like us to read all of us if we can but the bible says blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are they meek for they shall inherit the earth verse 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god blessed are the peacemakers for they shall call they shall be called the children of god verse 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of god for them is the for theirs is the kingdom of heaven if you notice verse 6 i've got the word righteousness and also verse 10. it's got the word righteousness amen let us pray the faith let's pray our heavenly father great eternal mighty unlimited god we stand before you this evening not because we deserve it father we stand before you not because we are worthy we stand before you this evening not because we qualify but lord is because you chose to give us your love is because father you elected us and specifically loved us father god and chose us with your elective love that is why we are here this evening that is why we stand in your presence it's not because we drove here with our cars it's not because of our ability and capacity father it is because you preordained that we are here this evening to come and stand and honor thy name and honor father god what we have done because the songwriter said i will never be able to repay what you have done lord jesus that is why we stand and read your word father and after reading it father we need to pray and dedicate it to you so that you can anoint it to our hearts so that you can stimulate both our hearts our ears and everything in us to respond to your weight this evening we pray father that you can bless both the speaker and the hearer i pray lord god that your spirit will take control and preeminence in the service of the living god we know each other there's not much of a visitor here tonight so lord make us relax father god not wander around in our minds and hearts father so that we must not miss not even an iota of your word is our prayer this evening we commit the service we commit this little prayer meeting this evening lord into thy precious and mighty and most capable hands of our loving lord jesus christ we pray with thanksgiving amen god bless you you may enjoy the comfort of your seeds while i remain standing amen how many of you have had a wonderful day today amen for that believer is always a wonderful day like what brother brother phil said when in when he was praying i don't know how many of you heard him he said we thank you for the trials you know the bible says we must count it as a blessing when the trials and temptations and all sorts of things come our way amen we must count it as a blessing in other words if something tough what you regard as tough time comes your way say thank you lord because it is those kind of things that are going to bring you closer to god tonight i would like us to talk about a simple weight called hunger amen how many knows hunger i believe each one of us tonight before we came here we ate something isn't it and i believe since yesterday we have eaten a couple of times isn't or it i i'm not talking to people who don't eat um who loves hunger who loves hunger i love hunger because it is hunger that makes me to eat and it is hunger that makes me to think about what i'm going to eat because i'm not just going to to drink milk when i'm so hungry no i'm going to eat something that fills my stomach and i'm going to make sure that that something is going to benefit my body so hunger is a very is a natural thing god has made it even god himself said to the children to his children at the garden of eden fasting they must not eat that see from that tree which means they were going to have to satisfy some form of a not the begs leading to anger that we have today no some form of hunger was going to be the hunger of fellowship with god a hunger of being with god a hunger so somehow they were forbidden not to eat you cannot eat if you're not hungry if you eat and you're not hungry there's a problem there's a problem nowadays when we just eat but we are not actually hungry why do we eat when we are not hungry we must our eating must be as a response to hunger natural isn't it brother film our eating must be as a response people of course okay nowadays because of satan's eating we've got things you know that we're just nibbling you know we're just nibbling because we are in laodicea we say we think we've we've got enough where we can eat like that guy in the bible when david sent a man to get water to get some food he was just what do you call the word clattening he was just eating was just clutter us if there's such a weight so we mustn't eat when we are not hungry or our eating must be as a response to satisfy something in our body and that's something if you zoom into it you'll find that it is bound or it is it has got hunger inside it right so it is a hunger is a state of um it's a state it's a state of feeling you know a need to eat to satisfy your body because there's something that is short and you eat for that purpose to gain strength for our little girls and boys to grow to develop isn't it and so hunger therefore if you look at it it's a good thing if you come to look at it it's a good thing because it helps us because if we don't eat we die so what if we don't get hungry then we'll die even before we start because it is a law of god that you for you to to exist physically you must eat if you don't eat what will happen to you you die so what if you don't get hungry then that is a problem and that's why i want us to i want us to think about that that thought around this idea of your hunger and what actually fills your hunger i want us to be simple get into the thought preach together as i'm busy talking you say yeah the brother is right here here here here you know participate with me i'm gonna just make it very simple if you hear that i'm hard on you just you know then i'll reduce the speed but but what i'm trying to say brothers and sisters is that uh there is a reason why god gave hunger and hunger my hunger your hunger has to be filled what we have read in the book of matthew the bible says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled uh i'm not talking about the appetite still literally we're having a chat at home and uh so that there is appetite and there is hunger appetite in my view is is more a hormonal issue brother and it's more a uh something that you can still be hungry but not have happy times am i wrong or right you can be you can have appetite but you're not hungry but you just want to eat eh especially these people who don't do diet sisters do diet so sisters know how to control this appetite but the issue that i'm trying to say is that i'm not trying to talk about epithet i'm talking about hunger in a specific way you'll understand me as we go along because the prophet says everybody has got hunger the problem is this and this is where we have read i'm talking about hungering for righteousness you see that's what i'm talking about i admit and i agree that everyone because we human being we are created in the image of god part of us have got a sample brother ben will tell us what the sample is he works in the lab a sample which is our soul of god are we together this thing i hear some echo my brother ate so now that soul of us craves for something all the time so it's a law that god has put but there must be something to respond to it now everybody has got that all human beings have got that spot in them or a soul because it is part of god to hunger for something but tonight i'm not talking about that because everybody can hunger and satisfy their hunger with many different sorts of things but the bible says a blessed ah let me read it blessed are they with hunger and thirst for after righteousness that means there are people who get hungry but they don't get hungry for righteousness that means there are people who get hungry but they are frustrated and not know how to satisfy their anger i mean their hunger not anger so it it it brings us to a point where we must sit and think i am so blessed because i've got a hunger for god and my challenge tonight especially to the young people this is a key learning point to take home what if i don't have the hunger that is a big problem because this is a reality where you find that a young child a young believer even elder older believers they are there there is no hunger why we need to ask ourselves why is there no hunger and the bible says ask anything isn't it i'm gonna read for you so we need to get worried if we don't get hungry for righteousness which mother in this room and father won't be worried if a child like faith doesn't get angry you'll find the mother even forcing says this child never ate for the last three days they will make sure that that child eat because he or she must get hungry otherwise it is going to jeopardize or impact negatively on the growth of the child so the mother knows in fact the mother will be having lots of milk painting hair to come out because naturally it's time for that milk to come out for william to drink it isn't it brother ben so it must happen that william must respond william must get hungry otherwise papa crist ben and mama christine will get worried and every one of us in here will get worried including yourself if you don't get hungry you're going to ask your partner hey bronwell i'm not getting angry what is happening with me i haven't i haven't eaten for the last and i did not decide to fast but i'm not getting hungry what is the problem just eat any just eat anyhow because your hunger would have been affected by something in your system maybe you're stressed maybe there's something preoccupying that hunger so there is people who are not like you who don't hunger for righteousness and those people me and you have to be worried for them because we can see that hey how are they how are they living without getting hungry for god now let's watch out that us ourselves we get hungry for god and now after being hungry whatever what i would like to stagger this thing like this is that if you find yourself as a young person as an older person sitting here not getting hungry one thing that you need to start doing is to start and be on your knees because you have identified a problem the pastor here on the pulpit i don't know how many did it the pastor said go and write go and write 10 or whatever number things and put them in your bible that you need that you identify there's more i can assure you i can guarantee you how many went and wrote to go and write the things that you need identify them because you see let me show you something the devil does not want you to to identify your problems and acknowledge them or your challenges let me not say your problems because they are not yours but the devil does not want you to identify the challenges that you come across that bothers you heavies things like that he does not want to they are not yours but he has attached them you know when we attach something when you send an email you attach you attach something or when when they send it then you are attached so the devil likes to attach things to us and then call them ours right now we need to identify those things and disown them those are the those are the things that are actually eating away our hunger for god those are the things that are eating away our hunger for prayer those are the things that are eating away the our hunger for righteousness for our god is righteous his everything in him that's everything if you are testing and hungering for god blessed are thee the bible says blessed are you are we blessed and that is a promise god never lie i can tell you a lot of things about this god before i i go i go further i love him so much because he has shown me that he is eternal he has shown me even physically that he is so eternal i i like to watch this dvd of louis louis glue i like to watch it because it it challenges me so much i love astronomy so now in there they looked at the human cell and they investigate and they check and they find and they found that one of the cells one of the cells is made like like this cross it's made like this a cell and although this is a topic of some other day but god is so big that if you look at this world this earth the cosmos the earth the planet where we are now for some of the planets for uh for us to for me to form it just to four minutes have got this planet you know we need 200 million something to form that one planet and the bible says god god created all of them and he calls each one by name and they respond to him they have not even found how big is the universe they have not even found i say and this is my astronomy don't take this home i wish it could be not recorded i i think this atmosphere is eternal in this way the physical times the spiritual we know that heaven is a dimension right and we know our god is it it's eternal it's not ending you'll never find and say god is from here to here if they cannot find the universe okay let's say they find it then what is on the other side of the universe if the universe can be from here to here it brings me to a thought when the prophet says god the revelation of god is like those sparks you know and and and the more you go the more he opens you'll never finish him you'll never analyze him and say oh this is all the stars never that is why and he says you we must ask to be free and free because we'll never be sufficiently free we must get more and more and more and more of god until we are like enoch and he takes us home ma or god so they i don't think they'll ever get to a point where they say ah now we think we are just 110 000 light years away from where the universe ends never because the more they go the more the more they make a bigger planet the more they find out that ah the distance where where we want to go is actually where we come from it's just a fraction of where we want to go they will go i mean a light year everybody understand how big is the idea the distance which light travels a second the distance we slide travels a year sorry light travels at 160 186 kilometers a second 186 000 kilometers from the sun to here to my skin it travels in speed of 186 000 kilometers a second and it arrives here at that speed now that speed the whole year january to december counting it is called one light year so it will take them hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and millions of light years for them to exhaust eternity to exhaust the universe i'm not saying the universe is eternity but i'm saying physically speaking it looks to me that it's an ending if there are planets that are 200 million times this earth our earth actually they say our earth and our sun is so insignificant in the bigger scheme of things so small is our earth so small our uni our our current is called the the milky way our solar system is so small so invisible but you know what in that beach in that big big big thing god saw you in there oh my now how small am i so this fascinates me every day it encourages me to realize that you know what i'm saving a big god my god is not my god i'm saving a big one when i say big it's an understatement it's a very very very understatement i don't have a word to explain him but that one is the one that i'm talking to you tonight that he said if you hunger for righteousness he will feel you how can you not believe that he can feel you when he made so much a big universe and you know what of the millions and millions and millions of sun grains on the seashore worldwide he knows each one of them he knows each one of those sent grains and he knows how many are they you cannot over express god we can never express him enough i mean to say he's so big this is the god that said if you hunger for me i will fill you with righteousness in other words i will fill you with myself because he is the righteousness amen now the problem of hunger is that you can only satisfy it by means of eating okay let me contextualize my my my point because we've got spiritual hunger right spiritual hunger we've got other hungers or hungers if you don't know where you you feel you feel you feel you know we are social social beings you need to associate you you know you just hear someone saying i miss you oh i haven't seen you as brother i miss you when you went to south island i mean that i'm hungering for you i need to fellowship with you to have more of you that's what fellowship is about isn't it i have not seen you hey brother i missed you man i mean i'm thirsty for you to fellowship with you because if we are hungering for god then god comes inward it is him who comes inside us and he fills us and we are in him and he is in us right right now we if you find that you miss god you are hungering for god you are hungry for righteousness and that's what we must cry and strive for every day if hunger is 100 huh if you look at this boat if hamlet's hunt is this boat and then which represent hundred percent for isaac and then you find that ah only this corner if this is my hunger for the day only this corner is for god i'm hungry for god the rest of the other hunger is for other things if my hunger is not streamlined to god i've got a problem if this is my hand if our hunger daily brothers and sisters it's not hungering for god enough the prophet says it i'll read it for you we need to be able to say only this is for my business for my things for my problems and whatever and the rest of my hunger for daily hunger let me put it daily let's not say monthly no daily let's say daily hunger right our daily hunger system it must be that if this is my hunger daily this peace oh let me be fair the big part of it must be for god that's the point i'm trying to say right actually it must be 100 gods all of that boat and then him he'll take care of everything that's what he said isn't it so but you find that we are busy our hunger is for other things man how do we see that our hunger is for other things because of what we eat you see because of what we satisfy our hunger every the body is the body is very simple god made the body very simple if i if he's warning i crave or i hunger for the food that will break the fast i'm not gonna have be on a five day fast then when i break the fast i just go on a big pop my body will be so because i must eat soft stuff to get the stomach back into the system you know you're fasting right that's why they call it break fast you don't just start with a heavy heavy big meal your stomach will even be so you need to start with a simple thing that will ease your body right so now now now now i i lost my point the point i'm trying to say was when our hunger must be satisfied with the right things the more we don't eat things of god the more we don't think the things of god the more we don't anticipate the more we don't david says in the word of god in one of the psalms when i meditate about you day and night god you come he comes closer to you when you think good about other phil you think good about sister k you look none of us in here is without errors and mistakes the issue is when i look at andy what do i see when i look at him when i look at sister priscilla when i look at ben when i look at marion what what do i see when i look do i see a son of god or i see my own imagination i'm satisfying a wrong hunger be careful be careful because when you look at a believer when you talk to a believer you know i was blessed so much many years by a lady who was not even a believer she said to me she was my colleague she said to me paul you know when you work at work sister now you work as if you work for god you'll understand me a believer don't work shortcuts a believer don't work a believer works until they know that this one this one is a christian christians behave like this a believer because our jobs god gave us so we work so honest so faithful so extra mild the same way as if we are doing it for god because we are not actually getting reinvestment or performance or anything from those people we are working for our one comes from heaven our salary our reinvestment our performance bonus comes from not from our custom our employer listen even if donna could not employ you if god said they must employ you they've got no choice you see the thing is that we are we we need to realize that we are controlled from a different government we are managed from a different employer our payslips don't come here no no that is why even our time is for the lord we don't employ we don't we are above our balls that is why we can work better than our boss you see so everything about a child of god is above we are employed from heaven that is why sister doesn't bother us we give him what he wants [Music] we our father have got a cattle on a thousand hills gold and diamond is the things that we walk on we walk on them this pavement that you see here what they are fighting and killing one another right now ours us not proudly so we walk on it it's our pavement we fix the road with it gold and diamond and what other stones do you know beautiful stones emerald jasper sephora all those stones we decorate our work parts with them our driveways of your mansion when you get there brother brother brother isaac and sister shannon your mention when we get them you want to say lord andy i don't know what you want but i want a bit of stuff right here on on these walls sapphire here emerald this side but for my driveway i want pure diamond black one black diamond so the point i'm trying to show to you is that such kind of riches is unexplainable in the context of this world so that is why we must not underrate ourselves the world must not deceive us by by taking a lot of our time and hunger that is supposed to be satisfied by the things of god every day as if we are from here we shouldn't forget that amnesia must not affect us we must be aware every day of who we are every second when we think when we talk when we look when we walk we know we know even if they don't pay you right that is why if if if they pay you more you go back to them and say you paid me more because because me and you are not from this world when i returned a change one day to a man who gave me more change he was surprised but i couldn't explain to him except to say that i'm just a christian you see one day me and my friend went to the bank and we found that it had one million we were just students and we go inside the bank and tell them to correct it and we were hungry before we could even draw 20 in with one incident because we don't depend on this world that is why they don't understand us or the world cannot understand you therefore our hunger must not help this worldly guy to be satisfied this car must be stopped that's what the pastor said here if i had him correct he said no no this guy even if he's tired he must go and bind and pray one day he will thank me when he has finally changed he'll thank me and say thank you thank you for pushing me to worship god he'll thank me this guy i'm not this guy amen sorry i left my message let's read romans chapter 10. i'll read it quickly for you so that you mustn't amazing take longer if it's okay with you but if you can hope if you're a quick bible flippa of the pages you can get it quickly brother and my heart desire and pray my heart let me read let me not read from the paper sorry let me read from from the bible from verse 1. romans chapter 10 romans 10 1 brethren my heart desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved you are spiritual israel we know that so i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god and that is a warning to you and to me we mustn't have our own righteousness our own self-justification our heart must be easy to repent we must be bendable you know flex spiritually flexed spiritually flexible when the lord bent us this way then so that's how we need to be that is the only way that we are going to be able to gain this the righteousness of god otherwise we are going to be self-righteous and you tell me i can't bend because the way i am i'm right so how is the lord going to mold us he won't be able to we'll be like this israel that paul is praying for them that they have now developed a self-righteousness right let's read verse 4 of the same chapter for christ is the end of the law of righteousness to everyone that believeth for moses is described by the righteousness which is of the law that the man which do it those things shall live by them verse six but but the righteousness which is of faith speaking of the on these wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down from above christ is our righteousness you see and and that is what we need to seek to have the righteousness of god righteousness is called so if you unpack the word righteousness you'll find that righteousness is called his quote is not uh it's not like to be right although that is part of his righteousness has got everything from god he justifies god he's got justification he's just everything you need righteousness that is why christ is our righteousness he's everything for us amen so that is why and to to have him you've got everything to have him in your heart to have the spirit of god and fast for him every day that is what will bring the righteousness of god amen luke 2 luke 6 21 blessed are ye that hunger now blessed is that hunger now for you shall be filled this repeats itself in the bible same bible right blessed ie that weep now for ye shall laugh amos 8 11 behold the days come say the lord behold the day the days come say the lord that i will send a famine feminist hunger in the land not a famine of breed no no no a taste of water but of hearing the words of the lord and this is the day that we are living in where there's hunger everywhere there's famine everywhere but they don't know how to satisfy it the world does not know but me and you have got mount everest of bread have got mount everest of the world have got god himself for me for me is more than an opportunity for me is more than a privilege our young people and teenagers don't have first to test the world before they eat the mountain no that brother's poo brother uh john he said you don't have to go to the wild fest because you've got you you were just born in the milkman you know to be born inside milk you were just born on a plate of gold when we were born when other another child were born in thorns and they had to navigate and be found and be picked up there by the lord you were born on cheese you know cheese [Laughter] i'm trying to explain something that is you know i'm trying to you have born i can't say lucky you are blessed you are born with a wonderful opportunity and a privilege all what you need to do as a young person is to realize that hey i am more than the word lucky let me grab this opportunity lord i'm not going to wait for the devil telling me i don't have the revelation no i have it even if i don't have it i will have it let me keep on moving because first catch the revelation that hey you were born privileged the day you were born god made you ah it's like it's like when the angel came to mary and he said blessed are thou among only men that angel was very right it was the angel was 100 percent correct to be chosen to to give birth to god that's a great privilege but now you and me despite all what happened in our life despite our background here we are tonight we find ourselves here on that was the day today on the 13th of january 2021 eating believing the message of the hour of our time i was i was saying to one of my boys no no there is nothing wrong with doing all various things you see there's nothing wrong in eating and i'm talking about spiritual spiritual things now there's nothing wrong to read other books of the testimonies to read the books of uh the matthias the people history the what's that the fox book of matthias and other things those are good to enrich your experience and for you to see but to be honest with you there is a wait for your day that is the only one that is going to bring you grow and make you grow stronger and stronger and stronger think about this gabby my friend how old are you gaby five just imagine if mama christine keeps on giving her the milk that william drinks yeah what will happen to gaby just imagine it's not right gabi started to eat meat and strong food for her to be a tough and a strong girl isn't it so you that is still food but it's not for your day make sure that your diet is filled with the food for your day hunger for the right food for hunger that gets satisfied with the wrong food it's been a it's been misfilled it's not been filled properly that hunger is there it's a great blessing it's there god gave it to you but you take it and you fill it up with other things that are not really good you just cheat on this diet you just cheat and eat something else that will just get that will add another two kilograms of the devil okay not of the devil but of of not the foot of your day that will just add another two kilograms another 10 calories you know of just being a believer just being a christian who goes along when there's an opportunity to become a joshua and a caleb who says hey we will take that land that land is ours we don't care whether they've got six fingers whether they are taller than us god has said it and that settled it he said to our father abraham not even you moses we you we hear you he said even to our father abraham we will say journey for any foreign land will be there enslaved and after 400 years he'll come and take us that's the promise of god with david abraham abraham who had a child when he was how many years so that kind of a god don't take him light amen now in the spurgeon word show as the father and he suffers this earth brother brandon says but notice when a man is hungering and testing for god god will draw nigh to the man always give up surrender your will to god that's what the prophet says there's nothing that me and you are going to do if we we find that we are our hunger is 70 percent not for god daily is time to give up and surrender ourselves to god so that he can give us a proper hunger with a proper diet then they go together then you'll see me growing taller and you say ah this brother we thought he's short you see that is what will happen that is what will happen you'll see me growing stronger and bigger people in this country they're surprising especially of the pacific island they're big you see you know when i see them i think of my spiritual big bigness i say lord make me like that i want an oversized pens spiritually xxxxxl spiritually so i want to be big right there you see i want to eat but the red food satisfying the right hunger because you if you have anger and you're satisfied with the wrong food it's still a problem it's a problem not to have hunger for the lord one point another problem to have the hunger of god but satisfy it with the wrong food that hunger must be said this is now for the adults now even the children together hunger of god is a blessing it shall be filled don't interrupt the plan of god and fill it up with something else let's fill it up with the right diet if you can't find the food in the cupboard go and pray how can god give that woman a bowl of oil and meal endlessly until then come and fail to come and give you food you the bride who is living at the end of the end of times the closing of history he put you to live here and he comes and ignore you no ways he'll never do that he will never do that otherwise he would have failed to be god he will never ever fail and he put the bible and all the records for you to come and use them as a reference and say hey devil you can't tell me you let me suffer and die i want to have a t-shirt if someone can get me brother that's what i'm a fool for jesus who's full are you at the back and walk and walk and walk there in town with it i don't know if they'll arrest me bro i'm a fool for jesus who's full are you at the back that will be a nice testimony so because that doesn't matter what the world says is a lie about you we are god children period god spoke god brought you in the word god gave it to you let us make our salvation sure amen i was reading now what the prophet said right in the spoken word called the angel of the lord 1951 the scientific world looks at it they hush it they don't want to get they don't want it to get any further so what was was it was it in your day but those who are hungering and fasting for righteousness shall be filled the prophet says this all across the message for no now and those who are procrastinated to see the kingdom shall see it right for no man can come to my father or come to me except my father draws me if you hear me saying i'll read you what the prophet wrote here i'm just reading everything as it is the lord the lord there's there's those here who believe the lord the prophet says here you see this issue of hunger if it comes to a point where it it makes us realize that okay our hunger don't just come no no it is somebody gives us that hunger that's right you see there's somebody who gives us that hunger and that person is god he gives us that hunger because there's no one who can come to god unless he is called right by god so there's no one who's going to hunger for god if god did not give you that hunger right so therefore it is up to us now everything that god has done is now up to us to make sure that what he has already given us we brings it to manifestation because he has already given it to us for free so it is for us if we i mean he said ask for anything man what is anything anything is any anything let me make your mind think a little bit if you are looking for a car to buy a car and you find that i need a car but hey i don't have money then you ask god for money but then money can come by waking all by jobs then you ask for a job then a job that okay then the job master must be companies there must be jobs out there that god must make those companies available everything that you need if you find that you are not able to ask then ask god to give you the ability to ask so it's anything brothers and sisters anything for a believer there must not be a point of stuck that way you are stuck no if there's not if you find that now ask for that thing and peg it if you find that there's a problem here i don't know unpack it then you must deal with them individually god i'm asking for this and for this and for this you find that you can't pray maybe there's something that is making not to be able to pray you deal with that thing first unpack it and say okay the problem is one two three four that eventually uh brings to the problem of leg of prayer then let me deal with these things what makes those things to come the bottom ones let me deal with them until you get to the root of the matter why because he said ask for anything i'm gonna check my watch right what time did we start 7 30am it's almost five it's almost 20 30 now so i'm rapping it's a prayer meeting i'm supposed to be short i thought i'll take just 20 minutes sorry about that now i'll read for you here the spoken word is titled scriptural science of the time and you know faith commits by hearing hearing the word of god there is hearing and there's hearing to hear you can hear because our ears are open in my language they say severalness which means an ear has got no lid it hears the hearing that we are talking about here is the hearing the the real hearing with revelation to hear the word of god saying armand i'm talking to you and hear your name being called when the prophet preaches when the pastor preaches you hear your name you hear him saying paul you my son i'm talking to you when you think the pastor was with you at your house no he was not there it is the word of god calling thy name amen right that's what the that's what that that that's what the prophet says faith commits by hearing and he repeats it why did the bible say did you ever come to think of it if you open it then you'll see faith commit by hearing and it says hearing the word of god why does the bible repeat the word hearing faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of god for me it was supposed to be to be bold that hearing and this little queen talking about queen of queen of sheba this little queen god hung got to hungering and she wanted to go to this revival and she had a whole lot of comfort to confront her now the first thing she was preparing she would have to go to her priest to ask if she i'm sitting under correction here and if she would she could leave she was a queen she was in dignity in a celebrity but she was hungering you see she was hungering because she had that in israel there is a god he was like graham as we heard on sunday amen now and and and the question now in conclusion brothers and sisters is are we hungering if we are hungering you know this good right if we are hungering for righteousness good but are we are we feeding our hunger with the right diet that's the question but the prophet says in the message elijah brother i tell you when a man is really getting hungering and thirsting for god he'll receive it if you are hungering and fasting for god you will receive it amen the trouble it of it is that's the prophet now the pro the problem of it is that the church is not hungarian enough tonight that is the problem we are hungry but not enough a child must get hungry for him to grow let us ask for more hunger of god and by the way our hunger our our diet is the word of god but there's some there's some different vitamins that god is going to be feeding you on because according to your need according to your shortage according to your requirements god is a wonderful god he he he knows your requirements and he gives you according to your requirements oh vitamin c on b and d oh yeah he is b1 oh c a you know he gives all those are in his word full packed ready for me and for you all we need to do is to hunger more hunger more so that our hunger can be filled and be filled with the right stuff that's what we need to do this evening that's what i need to do this evening for us to be able to get righteousness from the lord how many loves the lord i love him so much and i appreciate him i think i finished my two my three pages and i my prayer is that though i might have not expounded this in a much more um way but i believe that the holy spirit will speak to you the holy spirit will drive the point home that when you go home you'll start to regurgitate these things and think about them just just imagine what will happen if you can take 50 percent of your time a day thinking about god think about what will happen i can tell you a testimony that one day a flight left me and a brother we were going for a funeral it was going to be a friday which was a public holiday on a thursday we had the airport going to a funeral and on saturday a wedding where i was supposed to speak at a friend's wedding saturday funeral for another young brother the airport was in johannesburg 1400 kilometers from cape town from the airport we were supposed to drive another 600 kilometers at night to the funeral bury the brother come back and go to the wedding another 600 backwards so when we were at the airport the flight left us and there was there was only three flies left to join us back and we were put on a list waiting list you know when the when the where they just say if anyone can tell us you can come in we were on standby and we waited we were at the bottom i remember very well i was number 25 the brother was number 26 meaning all those 24 people must first get in on standby and they've told us clearly is fully booked the flight is overbooked we said but we need to get there we just sat there talk talk talk the first one left the second one left the third one they sent everybody home when it was just about maybe an hour or so to leave they sent everybody home they said let's come tomorrow morning we'll come in and reboot you on the flights he said okay everybody took their tickets to everything took everything and then people left and me and the brother just said on this tube they were we we did not have any plans we did not it's like we are not thinking whether we want to go or not but we just sat on the stoop or the the veranda of at the airport that we were just talking we were just talking and we talked we just fellowshipping i remember we're discussing about whether we should go to my house or his house so that tomorrow morning we can come together early we are talking talking then when we are busy talking about god then we were discussing about the prophet one day when uh that that that flight was delayed was was grounded and we were starting to talk about that and we talked about that and we said yo and we were in that discussion not with our flies in our minds at least i know i was not having that flight in my mind i knew that for us to go 25 people first must go before i can go but the key was everybody left was supposed to come tomorrow we were sitting sitting sitting and talking it was about five minutes before the flight could take off we saw a lady rushing running to the to the counter they said where are those people from johannesburg johannesburg i need two people brother it was like i don't know what happened until even when i was already in the aeroplane i still could not believe it i was already in the role playing on air but i still couldn't believe it that is how this flesh wants to take you down to that the thing the word of god is so obvious it's so real it's so powerful that the devil wants that even if you have already received it not to believe it how can that be i have received the reality of my life thank you for that message of reality brother i have received the reality that's right of the word of god and the devil see what he you see can the devil can teach us a great lesson he doesn't give up and actually we are double than him we must say oh you are 20 we are 40 boys amen if you are 20 we are 40 in terms of not giving up you can tell us even if i fall now even if i do something wrong now i tell you devil i am the son of god now can i allow the devil to tell you that abraham did not have to argue with him he just didn't know god spoke amen how he's going to do it it's not for me how god is going to make me have a child when i don't have any seat in me any nothing my wife how can you how can you how can a a child a girl who don't meet any man get pregnant can you sensibly think about it how it's going to happen is none of my business god the the the point is this that we must understand the point is that god said it and that's the key god if god says something that's it there's nothing for you for me to think about or to try to imagine how god said i will fill you if you hunger for righteousness that's it how no no he knows because why he said it if a god who can say let there be planets in the universe and they just come spewing out of his mouth like the whole universe i mean what kind of a god is that one and he chooses me who am i who are you but me who is nothing i wish for the ending can preach a message like this out of nothing there came something me i'm nothing i think if he preaches he can be such a powerful sermon out of zero god brought something me who was a zero who who was less than zero god brought himself in there and he made me something isn't that a great privilege brothers and sisters therefore let's go hungering let us go hungering and before you know it you'll be walking around with your heart feel of happiness amen god bless you richly tonight i believe that the lord will give us hunger let us sing a beautiful song for the lord before we come to prayer tonight that says uh by his weight you know that one did i teach you that one okay let me put it this way who's got a worshipping song who have a worshipping song to sing because it's a prayer meeting i need everyone to be participating amen let's sing that worshipping song let's sing it prayerfully let's sing it reverently blessing from the bottom of our hearts just thinking about god be it unto me according to your promises amen [Music] [Music] according to your promises i can stand securely [Music] it again [Music] according to your promises [Music] sets me free according [Music] it one more time unto me according my heart the truth that sets me free i fall into your promises amen with our eyes closed just thinking about the lord just take this little moment and think about god not nothing else just think about the lord and what this song is saying be it unto me lord according to your promises that's my prayer tonight as we are reverent before god there are some prayer requests that has been forwarded and we are going to pray
