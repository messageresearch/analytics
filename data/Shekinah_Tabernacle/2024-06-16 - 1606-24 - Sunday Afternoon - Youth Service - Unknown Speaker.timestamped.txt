[33:49] Saints let's um read here in the book of
[33:52] Mal is it too small probably Malachi
[33:57] chapter 4
[33:59] let's read
[34:03] it thank you
[34:05] m the Bible says for behold the day
[34:09] cometh that shall burn as an aen and all
[34:12] the proud ye in all that do wickedly
[34:16] shall be
[34:17] stbl and the day that cometh shall burn
[34:20] them up sayith the Lord of host that he
[34:23] shall leave them neither root nor Branch
[34:26] but unto you
[34:28] that fear my name shall the son of
[34:30] righteousness arise with healing in his
[34:32] wings and ye shall go forth and grow up
[34:35] as cves of the stone and ye shall tread
[34:38] down the wicked for they shall be ashes
[34:41] Under The Souls of your feet in the day
[34:43] that I shall do this say the Lord of
[34:46] hosts remember ye the law of Moses my
[34:49] servant which I commanded unto him in
[34:52] ARB for all Israel with the judges and
[34:56] judgments behold I'll send you Elijah
[34:59] the prophet before the coming of the
[35:01] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[35:04] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[35:06] to the children and the hearts of the
[35:08] children to the F fathers let I come and
[35:12] smite the Earth with a kiss let's just
[35:15] bow our heads almighty God we want to
[35:17] give you thanks because you're an
[35:19] awesome God Lord thank you for all your
[35:21] blessings we I want to ask you Lord to
[35:23] please use me this evening Lord to talk
[35:26] to you people
[35:28] take me out of here Lord and just be you
[35:31] the one that's going to speak I ask you
[35:33] this in Jesus Christ's name amen you may
[35:36] have your s God bless you
[35:39] Saints so that's a well-known scripture
[35:42] for us that was my favorite chapter in
[35:44] the Bible when I was growing I was
[35:47] waiting for an Elijah I don't know how
[35:50] but God put that Revelation in my life
[35:53] and that's why I did whatever I did
[35:55] because I was waiting for Elijah I knew
[35:58] the before the coming of Christ Elijah
[36:01] has to come I didn't know anything about
[36:04] the prophet didn't know about anything
[36:06] about brother Brandon I was waiting for
[36:08] an Elijah so when I hear about this
[36:11] message it really talk to my heart and
[36:15] caught me and the Lord delivered
[36:18] me that's awesome
[36:20] Amen so I want to talk to you today
[36:23] about the reaction brother um arm man
[36:27] talk about this a couple of weeks ago I
[36:30] think and this thought um stayed in my
[36:34] mind so you know for every action that
[36:37] you do is going to be a
[36:39] reaction and actually just if to be a
[36:42] little bit smart here it's one of the
[36:44] the Third Law of Newton it
[36:47] says um the Third Law of Newton say for
[36:50] every action in nature there is an equal
[36:53] and opposite reaction so everything what
[36:56] you do is going to bring to you a
[36:58] reaction and you cannot Escape for that
[37:01] it's going to happen so um this
[37:05] world has been 6,000 years of sin on
[37:10] this world that's why the reaction of
[37:13] that sin is going to be the completely
[37:15] destruction of this world and I hope
[37:18] that you don't want to be there because
[37:20] that's going to be a really hot day but
[37:22] you're going to get caught up in heaven
[37:24] amen yeah but the
[37:28] we know that the wages of sin is death
[37:33] but the gift of God is eternal life
[37:35] through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen so
[37:39] there's no reason to get caught up there
[37:43] because the Lord is giving you the
[37:45] chance to turn your life give your life
[37:47] to him and he's going to take you out of
[37:50] here there's no way there's no reason to
[37:52] be there
[37:55] amen so during our life we're going to
[37:57] have to take many many decisions from
[38:00] the very first moment that you open your
[38:02] eyes you're taking decisions what are
[38:04] you going to wear what are you going to
[38:06] how you going to dress up what are you
[38:08] going to do are you going to brush your
[38:10] teeth are you not going to brush your
[38:12] teeth what are you going to H full of
[38:15] decisions but there's a really important
[38:19] decision the most important decision
[38:21] that you can take is follow Christ and
[38:24] that's the decision that you never
[38:27] going to be like um you're never going
[38:29] to reget regret it follow Christ has
[38:32] been the best decision that I've taken
[38:34] my entire life and then marry my wife
[38:37] because otherwise she she's
[38:41] watching but if we see through the Bible
[38:46] it's um that's gain and
[38:48] able the twins they grew up together
[38:51] they were
[38:52] brothers but there was one decision that
[38:55] changed him forever
[38:58] they had to present a sacrifice to the
[39:01] Lord and one of them did good and the
[39:04] other one did wrong but he didn't want
[39:07] it to learn he thought that he was very
[39:10] smart and he wanted to show his brother
[39:14] that he was best than him better than
[39:17] him and the Bible says that we shouldn't
[39:22] even treat bad with words our brothers
[39:26] and sisters so that's I'm just going to
[39:29] leave there don't don't treat bad the
[39:33] people because you can be accused of
[39:36] mother amen that's in the Bible I'm not
[39:40] I'm not inventing
[39:41] things so that's um Cain killing his
[39:44] brother he took a really bad decision
[39:47] and the consequences of that was that he
[39:49] got cursed by
[39:51] God in the other hand we have Enoch that
[39:54] he decided to walk with God and because
[39:57] he decided that God took him out of the
[40:00] earth he walked with God and God took
[40:03] him out of
[40:04] it so that decision is Chang for
[40:09] changing
[40:10] forever and he's in eternity now
[40:13] amen but this Earth and what's the
[40:15] condition of this Earth today I didn't
[40:18] put
[40:19] the like the name of the scripture but
[40:22] I'm pretty sure this
[40:24] is Luke 17 I think Luke 17 says and as
[40:28] it was in the days of
[40:30] Noah so shall it be also in the days of
[40:34] the son of man they did eat they drun
[40:37] they married wives wives multiple they
[40:41] were given in marriage until the day
[40:43] that Noah entered into the ark and the
[40:45] flood came and destroyed them
[40:48] all they were too busy to listen that
[40:53] Prophet talking to them because Noah was
[40:55] preaching to them he was telling them
[40:58] destruction is coming but they were too
[41:01] busy in their normal day getting married
[41:03] to wives they were too busy doing stuff
[41:06] they didn't wanted to listen and that's
[41:08] why the Lord destroyed that the
[41:11] world likewise also it was in the days
[41:14] of lot they did eat they drank they
[41:19] bought they sold they planted they build
[41:21] it but the same day that lot went out of
[41:24] Sodom it rained fire and Bri stom from
[41:27] from heaven and Destroy them
[41:29] all again they were too busy doing their
[41:32] own stuff God sent them two angels and
[41:36] they tried to abuse
[41:38] him they were so prar there such a
[41:42] homosexuality living in that City that
[41:45] they wanted to abuse Angels that's why
[41:47] they got
[41:48] destroyed
[41:50] amen that's the state of this world
[41:54] that's the decision that they have been
[41:55] taken
[41:57] they already took it the world is going
[41:58] to get destroyed that's going to happen
[42:00] the Lord said it
[42:03] so this is first
[42:06] Romans this world who changed the truth
[42:08] of God into a lie and worship and serve
[42:11] the creatures more than the
[42:12] Creator for who is blessed forever amen
[42:16] amen for this cause God gave them unto a
[42:19] v Affliction for even the woman did
[42:22] change the natural use into the which is
[42:25] against nature and likewise also the men
[42:28] living the natural ear of the woman
[42:31] buring in their last one towards another
[42:34] men with men working that which is
[42:37] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[42:39] that recompense of their era which was
[42:44] meat you can see this
[42:47] today like it was in the days of Sodom
[42:50] like it was in the days of Noah it's
[42:54] today amen uh prophet Isaiah says in um
[43:00] Isaiah
[43:01] 66 oh no I lo
[43:10] this um Isaiah
[43:13] 66 verse three yeah they have chosen
[43:16] their own ways and their soul Delight in
[43:19] their Abominations I also will choose
[43:22] their delusions and will bring them
[43:25] fears upon them because when I called
[43:28] none did answer when I SP spoke they did
[43:33] not hear but they did evil before my
[43:35] eyes and chose that it which I delighted
[43:39] not that's the worst stage that you can
[43:41] get when you know the truth and you
[43:44] decide not to do it I'm I'm sorry I
[43:47] don't know why the Lord put this thought
[43:49] in my heart because there is not quite
[43:51] what I normally
[43:53] talk so there's some decisions some
[43:57] there's some good habits that you can
[43:58] have and there's some destructive habits
[44:01] that you can create in your own
[44:03] life like if you get up and you take um
[44:08] you brush your teeth you have a bath all
[44:11] the ones that you can see there in the
[44:13] little picture it's going to help you to
[44:15] be a healthy person it's going to help
[44:19] you have you seen people that don't
[44:21] brush their teeth what happen to them
[44:24] it's bad
[44:27] but you can take good decisions and
[44:29] that's a good decision to do like in a
[44:31] in a natural way but if you pray and if
[44:33] you seek from the Lord your spirit is
[44:36] going to grow Galatians 6 says be not
[44:40] deceived God is Not mocked for
[44:42] whatsoever a man Seth that shall he also
[44:46] reap for he that sth to his flesh s
[44:50] shall of the flesh reap corruption but
[44:53] he that sth to the spirit shall of the
[44:57] spirit reap life Everlasting
[45:00] amen so if if you want
[45:04] um material things you can get them but
[45:09] that they are not going to stay with you
[45:10] forever they're going to disappear but
[45:13] if you s it full the
[45:16] spirit that's um Everlasting thing that
[45:19] you can
[45:22] do well I have a point but I think that
[45:25] I'm like getting like way too
[45:28] on the way Isaiah 8
[45:33] says for they have sown the wind they
[45:37] shall reap the
[45:38] Whirlwind and you know like the entire
[45:42] world knows that if you do something
[45:44] you're going to get a reaction they can
[45:46] call it karma they different ways that
[45:48] they call it but because it's a law and
[45:51] actually happen if you do something you
[45:54] going to have to wait for a reaction
[45:58] and I wanted to talk to you about King
[46:00] David was King David a good man or a bad
[46:03] man for the
[46:05] kids was it
[46:07] good oh you don't know no he was a good
[46:10] man he was a man of God but his life in
[46:14] his life you can
[46:16] see this action and reaction thing
[46:21] amen you know what he did
[46:24] he he went out with the woman of another
[46:26] another man that woman got pregnant and
[46:29] then he decided to cover his sin by
[46:32] killing that
[46:34] man but the way that
[46:38] David let's just read the
[46:41] Bible Second Kings says now therefore
[46:44] the sword is Nathan talking to him after
[46:47] all of this now therefore the sword
[46:50] shall NE depart from thine house because
[46:53] thou has despised me and has has taken
[46:56] the wife of of orah he to be thy wife
[47:00] thus sayith the Lord behold I will rise
[47:02] up evil against thee out of thine own
[47:05] house and I will take thine wives before
[47:08] thine eyes and give them unto the
[47:10] neighbors and he shall lie with they
[47:13] with thy wives in the side of the son
[47:16] for thou did in did it secretly but I
[47:20] will do this thing before all Israel and
[47:23] before the son and David said unto
[47:25] Nathan I have sinned against the Lord
[47:29] and Nathan said unto David the Lord also
[47:31] hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not lie
[47:36] so even though David did wrong he repent
[47:41] but he has to accept the consequences of
[47:43] his
[47:45] act terrible things were just about to
[47:47] happen to his to his house to the
[47:51] kingdom because he took a bad
[47:54] decision so
[47:59] just be careful with this decisions that
[48:02] you're going to
[48:03] take because you can repent and the Lord
[48:06] can forgive you but you're going to have
[48:09] to live with the
[48:11] consequences and you as all teenagers
[48:14] well this is a youth meeting sorry sorry
[48:16] all
[48:18] guys the consequences are going to stick
[48:20] with you for the rest of your
[48:23] life like David like many other examples
[48:27] be cautious with the thing that you do
[48:29] be cautious with the people that you
[48:31] hang
[48:32] around if you have bad friends even if
[48:36] there's some people with good Hearts but
[48:38] they do silly things and they can drag
[48:40] you to do silly stuff too and then
[48:43] you're going to get consequences because
[48:45] of
[48:46] that you can
[48:49] get um the Lord he can forgive you but
[48:53] there's some consequences that you're
[48:55] going to have to live with them
[48:57] and um yeah that's about myON that's
[49:00] what I said to brother Ben if I do
[49:03] something they I'm going to need your
[49:04] help to come here and fix it yeah let's
[49:06] have the musicians and just

[51:34] name amen praise the
[51:37] Lord amen thank you musicians thanks
[51:40] brother ker well I'm going to continue
[51:42] on from where Jimmy left off because my
[51:45] opening scripture is right after what he
[51:47] said when Nathan came and spoke to
[51:50] David we don't hatch these things up he
[51:52] stayed at my house last night but we
[51:53] didn't talk about what we're preaching
[51:54] okay just for so we're going to go to
[51:56] second Samuel that was in Kings but if
[51:58] you read the order of the story um this
[52:01] this is um right after after that where
[52:05] um Nathan says the sword will not leave
[52:06] your house um and then and then this
[52:11] happens so I like that you don't make
[52:14] decisions you take decisions what ones
[52:17] are you
[52:18] taking God help us make the right ones
[52:20] we'll take the right ones so it says
[52:22] here so say 2 Samuel 13:1 I'll try and
[52:25] not be um
[52:27] long it says here and it came to pass
[52:29] after this so what we just heard after
[52:32] this that Absalon the son of David had a
[52:34] feir sister whose name was Tamar and
[52:36] Ammon the son of David loved her and
[52:39] Ammon was so vexed that he fell sick for
[52:42] his sister Tamar for she was a virgin
[52:44] and Ammon thought it hard for him to do
[52:46] anything to her but Ammon had a friend
[52:49] whose name was jonadab the son of Shima
[52:54] David's brother and jonadab was a very
[52:57] subtle man he's a very crafty guy and he
[52:59] said unto him why art thou being the
[53:01] King's son lean from day to day wil thou
[53:04] not tell me and Ammon said unto him I
[53:07] love Tamar my brother absalon's sister
[53:11] and jonadab said unto him lay thee down
[53:13] on thy bed and make thyself sick and
[53:15] when thy father cometh to see thee say
[53:17] unto him I pray thee let my sister Tamar
[53:19] come and give me meat and dress the meat
[53:21] in my sight that I may see it and eat it
[53:23] at her hand so Ammon lay down made
[53:26] himself sick and when the King was come
[53:28] to see him Ammon said unto the king I
[53:30] pray thee let Tamar my sister come and
[53:32] make me a couple of cakes in my sight
[53:34] that I may eat at her hand then David
[53:37] sent um home to Tamar saying go now to
[53:39] thy Brother ammon's house and dress his
[53:42] meat so Tamar went to her brother
[53:44] ammon's house and he was laid down and
[53:47] she took flour and kneaded it and made
[53:49] cakes in his sight and did bake the
[53:50] cakes and she took a pan and poured them
[53:53] out before him but he refused to eat and
[53:55] Ammon said he have all um have out all
[53:58] men from me and they went out every man
[54:00] from him and Ammon said unto Tamar bring
[54:02] the meat into the chamber thma eat of
[54:04] thine hand and Tamar took the cakes
[54:07] which she had made and brought them into
[54:08] the chamber to Ammon her brother and
[54:11] when she had brought them unto him to
[54:13] eat he took her took hold of her and
[54:15] said unto her come lie with me my sister
[54:18] and she answered him nay my brother do
[54:19] not force me do for No Such Thing ought
[54:22] to be done in Israel do uh do not thou
[54:25] this folly and I whether shall I cause
[54:28] my shame to go and as for thee thou
[54:31] shall be as one of the fools in Israel
[54:33] now therefore I pray thee speak unto the
[54:35] king and he will not withhold me from
[54:37] thee how be it he would not hearken unto
[54:39] her voice but being stronger than she
[54:41] forced her and lay with her then Ammon
[54:44] hated her exceedingly for that the
[54:46] hatred wherewith he hated her was
[54:48] greater than the love wherewith he had
[54:50] loved her and Ammon said unto her arise
[54:53] be gone what a messy picture
[54:57] let's um let's pray shall we this
[54:59] afternoon gracious father we thank you
[55:01] so much Lord we can gather one more time
[55:03] just want to ask as we have read your
[55:04] word I pray you the great author of the
[55:06] word would anoint both speaker and
[55:08] hearer may have your way uh in the
[55:10] service we thank you Lord in Jesus
[55:12] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[55:14] friends you can have your seats I want
[55:16] to speak about trying to contain the
[55:19] uncontainable you know there's a saying
[55:22] uh with the zoo and so on or wild
[55:23] animals do not feed the animals because
[55:26] they'll hang around you and they'll
[55:28] cause you trouble and we know the devil
[55:31] is in the Bible it says he's the Beast
[55:34] and that word Beast is an untamable
[55:36] creature now here we have this this this
[55:39] picture of of uh Ammon here and and he
[55:42] has this fixation on her on his half
[55:45] sister Tam and what happens is is a
[55:49] desire you must be very careful where
[55:52] your desires take you here was this this
[55:55] man who did this exceedingly evil thing
[55:59] and he became so obsessed with with her
[56:03] uh with with his half sister you see
[56:05] people are obsessed with things in this
[56:06] day you know there's stalkers there's
[56:08] all kind of things people stalk people
[56:09] online you know but they create this
[56:12] insane reality about this person and you
[56:15] see that once and you could see his love
[56:17] was well perverted for her cuz one he he
[56:20] raped her two when he had done when when
[56:24] when the spirit had finished doing what
[56:26] it wanted to do in his life then he
[56:28] hated her so it wasn't a real it wasn't
[56:31] a real love it was just a perverted love
[56:33] it was a spirit motivating him to to do
[56:37] this now you see the thing is Ammon did
[56:40] not have the if I go back up
[56:43] here his vexation could not be expressed
[56:46] until until someone else came along you
[56:49] got to be very careful with the advice
[56:51] that you follow see this guy Jon ad
[56:53] debas the Bible says was a very subtle
[56:55] man very crafty man and he he allow he
[56:59] he he put the idea in ammon's mind how
[57:04] he can engineer a scene that he can have
[57:07] have his
[57:09] desire so you must be very careful where
[57:11] your your decision well the counsil you
[57:14] keep because evil spirits like to
[57:17] congregate together because in strength
[57:20] and numbers there strength and so these
[57:22] two Ammon couldn't do what he wanted he
[57:25] could not do what he wanted to do until
[57:28] jonadab gave him a way of doing it so
[57:32] people can become so vexed about
[57:34] something they just have to have this
[57:36] person have to have this thing it
[57:37] becomes their Obsession but it becomes a
[57:40] very sick Obsession it's not a Godly
[57:42] thing it's you it's a perverted desire
[57:45] and what's happens is this is this is a
[57:47] spirit comes into someone's life and
[57:50] causes us to be so you know brother Bram
[57:52] says we bump into demons every day don't
[57:53] realize
[57:55] it so we must be careful with our I know
[57:57] everyone's listening pretty your
[57:59] tattingers are turned on you're
[58:01] listening but you see we must be careful
[58:04] with what we uh the the the council we
[58:07] take and also the decisions we take
[58:10] because Spirits congregate together
[58:12] people will will become friends and
[58:15] outwardly it makes no sense why they're
[58:17] friends but it's actually Spirits
[58:19] joining themselves together now it says
[58:21] here in James let no man say that when I
[58:24] was tempted I am tempted of God for God
[58:26] cannot be tempted with evil neither temp
[58:28] tempteth he any man but every man is
[58:30] tempted when he is drawn away of his own
[58:33] lust and enticed then when lust has con
[58:36] conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
[58:38] when it's finished bringeth forth death
[58:40] he sayso not ER my beloved brethren we
[58:44] got to understand that both jonadab and
[58:47] Ammon they were in the King's house they
[58:49] were related to David either his son or
[58:52] his nephew they were raised up in church
[58:55] they were believers
[58:56] but somehow Ammon began to toy with this
[58:59] toy with this Obsession of his half
[59:01] sister and it grew from just maybe a
[59:03] thought and became such a reality to him
[59:06] that that his whole life was now fixed
[59:08] on
[59:11] her I'm I'm just going to leave that
[59:13] there I just want you to think of it see
[59:14] we got to be careful with what we get we
[59:16] allow ourselves allow our imagination we
[59:18] got to be careful we allow it to take us
[59:21] because we know the devil will will put
[59:23] a thought in our mind but then he'll
[59:25] anoint our feelings in our body and then
[59:28] because those feelings be so real we
[59:30] think it's the thing to follow but do
[59:32] not feed the animals do not feed this
[59:35] flesh right if it's if if it's not godly
[59:38] get rid of it right it's it's like
[59:41] brother Isaac preached a while ago how
[59:43] you know love in a marriage is is
[59:46] wholesome and right we know the bad is
[59:47] undefiled the Bible said but you take
[59:49] that same thing like a fire right it's
[59:50] in the fireplace it's good it's right
[59:52] it's safe it's good it's proper it
[59:53] should be burning but Outside the Fire
[59:55] just causes a Havoc you know outside the
[59:58] fireplace right so the same thing but in
[59:59] the wrong place this is what AMOM was
[1:00:02] doing now there's an old saying says
[1:00:04] show me your company I'll tell you who
[1:00:06] you are and that's right birds of a
[1:00:08] feather flock together or I'll say
[1:00:12] Spirits flock
[1:00:13] together right so you got to be very
[1:00:16] aware and careful who you gravitate
[1:00:19] towards because actually what it really
[1:00:21] is many times it's a Spirits calling out
[1:00:24] for each other and the the more the more
[1:00:27] a spirit can congregate together the
[1:00:29] more hold it has now it's amazing if you
[1:00:32] look at because you see sometimes people
[1:00:34] and you can see it at Camp you can see
[1:00:36] it anywhere people who begin to
[1:00:38] fellowship with with each other but they
[1:00:40] have nothing in common it makes humanly
[1:00:42] no sense why are these guys friends why
[1:00:44] are they hanging out it's actually
[1:00:45] Spirits are calling for
[1:00:47] fellowship and you see even this with
[1:00:49] Herod you know Jesus here was you know
[1:00:52] pilate sent sent Jesus to Herod uh and
[1:00:56] and if you read this I don't have the
[1:00:57] whole chapter here but you know Herod
[1:00:59] wanted to see a miracle of them and of
[1:01:00] course Jesus doesn't clown for anyone
[1:01:03] and then so it says in Herod went uh
[1:01:04] with his Men of War set him at n and
[1:01:06] mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous
[1:01:08] robe and sent him again to pilate and
[1:01:11] the same day pilot and Herod were made
[1:01:13] friends together for before they had
[1:01:15] were at enity between themselves so what
[1:01:18] caused them to become friends is that
[1:01:20] Antichrist spirit that caused the
[1:01:22] crucifixion was on pilate and it was on
[1:01:25] Herod so they had all things in common
[1:01:26] now they became friends but naturally
[1:01:28] you think pilate who's pilate he's a
[1:01:30] Roman Herod he's a a you know Jewish
[1:01:33] usurper they called them so they had
[1:01:34] nothing in common until that day so the
[1:01:38] spirit upon each of them brought
[1:01:41] Fellowship that's crazy but you see they
[1:01:45] had an attraction to they were friends
[1:01:47] now because the Same Spirit was upon
[1:01:49] each of them I really pray our
[1:01:51] friendships are because of the Holy
[1:01:52] Ghost you know that that that that that
[1:01:54] that we what we have in common is the
[1:01:56] Lord not some not some uh lust Spirit
[1:02:00] not some adultery Spirit not some evil
[1:02:02] spirit of the world lying whatever it
[1:02:04] may be but but what connects us is the
[1:02:07] Holy Ghost not not a spirit right but
[1:02:10] you see now Spirits congregate together
[1:02:13] and it gives them strength you know
[1:02:16] there's a saying you know one will chase
[1:02:17] a th000 two will chase 10,000 that's
[1:02:19] about Believers right there's strength
[1:02:21] and numbers there's strength and numbers
[1:02:22] with the devil as well and he knows this
[1:02:25] this is why he always calls out tries to
[1:02:26] reinforce himself you know a three-fold
[1:02:29] cord is not easily broken the Bible says
[1:02:32] the devil knows that too he uses that
[1:02:33] quite well if he can get more than you
[1:02:36] know if get three people to agree about
[1:02:37] something that will spread like wildfire
[1:02:40] if it's one it's just an opinion two
[1:02:42] well it's just them three it takes a
[1:02:44] established thing that's why gossip is
[1:02:46] such a terrible thing it's a spirit that
[1:02:48] wants to jump from one to another to
[1:02:50] bind the people in
[1:02:54] unbelief we read this here Jesus comes
[1:02:56] to his
[1:02:58] hometown he taught them in their
[1:03:00] synagogue in as much as they are
[1:03:02] astonished and said whence hath this man
[1:03:04] uh whence hath this man this wisdom and
[1:03:06] these Mighty works is not the is not
[1:03:10] this The Carpenter's son is not his
[1:03:12] mother called Mary and his Brethren
[1:03:14] James and Joseph and Simon and Judas and
[1:03:16] his sisters are they not all uh with us
[1:03:20] whence then hath this man all these
[1:03:21] things and they were offended in him but
[1:03:24] Jesus said unto them a Propet is not
[1:03:26] without honor saving his own country and
[1:03:27] his own house and he did not many mighty
[1:03:30] works there because of their unbelief so
[1:03:34] that Spirit was so strong among all the
[1:03:36] people that he couldn't do here's the
[1:03:38] Lord Of Glory now he couldn't do many
[1:03:40] mighty works there because the spirit
[1:03:42] was causing a Unity among the people but
[1:03:45] it wasn't a right kind of unity it was
[1:03:47] an antichrist Unity but it was a it was
[1:03:49] a demon power of unbelief on the people
[1:03:52] are you are you following me you see
[1:03:54] this principle there's power the demons
[1:03:56] have power if there's the numbers if
[1:03:59] they get more than one to agree with
[1:04:00] each other you know it tries to
[1:04:01] reinforce itself and so that's why we
[1:04:04] must be very careful about what we have
[1:04:07] what we have in common right you'll see
[1:04:10] people who have depression they'll
[1:04:11] gather together people of an anxiety
[1:04:14] they'll gather together lust spirits
[1:04:16] will gather together you see this in
[1:04:18] groups now I'm not looking anyone in
[1:04:20] particular okay but this is just from
[1:04:22] what I've seen around the place Spirits
[1:04:24] congregate go gossipers they have their
[1:04:27] club right they may different age
[1:04:29] different background you know different
[1:04:31] um you know family status or whatever
[1:04:34] more but yet that spirit will cause
[1:04:36] people to congregate together why
[1:04:38] because that Spirit those Spirits are
[1:04:40] calling out for help especially when you
[1:04:42] come to a place like camp or church
[1:04:44] demons are terrified because they know
[1:04:47] the power of the Holy Ghost they've been
[1:04:49] cast out before somewhere else some
[1:04:50] other time they know what it's like to
[1:04:52] be defeated so they say so they Say
[1:04:54] Never Again I'm not going to allow this
[1:04:56] to happen to me again they wise up to
[1:04:58] things right but you see it's wonderful
[1:05:00] with the message of the hour the devil
[1:05:02] is exposed
[1:05:07] completely he says nervousness is
[1:05:09] nothing for God to heal lady you believe
[1:05:11] he will heal nervous conditions there's
[1:05:14] just a whole group of this people
[1:05:15] suffering with the same thing how many
[1:05:17] out there are suffering with nervous
[1:05:18] condition Hold Your Hand see what I mean
[1:05:20] there's too many to call but them demons
[1:05:22] are calling one to another black streaks
[1:05:24] running everywhere the devil knows he's
[1:05:26] defeated he knows if he can only get
[1:05:28] those people if then people will only
[1:05:30] believe God it'll leave them right now
[1:05:32] every one of them and they'll all be
[1:05:34] made well so there's a there's an
[1:05:37] attraction between spirits to try and
[1:05:39] keep the people bound with that Spirit
[1:05:42] right that's why that's why you've got
[1:05:44] to you know you can't you can't
[1:05:46] entertain see people think they can
[1:05:48] manage a
[1:05:49] spirit they think they can you know they
[1:05:51] think they can manage it but I said you
[1:05:53] cannot contain the uncontainable
[1:05:55] you know because of demon like like for
[1:05:57] example here's Amon here in the
[1:05:58] beginning that thing I don't know how
[1:06:00] long he had that Obsession for and that
[1:06:02] Spirit would feed his imagination feed
[1:06:04] his desires and you know but then at the
[1:06:07] right opportunity it came out and did
[1:06:09] what it wanted to do but then when it
[1:06:11] was done he hated her because he would
[1:06:13] have realized what he's done right
[1:06:15] that's why so so the devil perverted it
[1:06:17] with a love but then when the spirit
[1:06:19] left he he hated her because the reality
[1:06:21] of the thing set in right and then
[1:06:24] that's what happens is like people you
[1:06:25] know you take people you take Spirits
[1:06:27] like pedophilia and all those kind of
[1:06:29] evil you know uh people who are
[1:06:30] predators they will that spirit will be
[1:06:33] in them it'll come out it'll do what
[1:06:34] it's done the person will even feel
[1:06:36] sorry but if they haven't completely
[1:06:38] repented and died out to the thing it
[1:06:40] will stay right there and it'll be
[1:06:41] hidden away and then that person say
[1:06:44] I'll never do it again but they're
[1:06:45] trying to contain the
[1:06:46] uncontainable they'll try and reason it
[1:06:48] away well I'm a Believer I've done this
[1:06:50] I've done that but it's still there
[1:06:52] right and then another maybe years later
[1:06:54] will come out again it'll do it thing
[1:06:56] it'll go back
[1:06:58] in see it's Spirits look for
[1:07:01] opportunities but if they can get you to
[1:07:03] realize no this is just you or your
[1:07:05] nature or something you're raised with
[1:07:07] then they can hide but if you really
[1:07:10] hate that thing then you can be free of
[1:07:12] it see it's easy it's easy to hate
[1:07:17] anxiety yep there's nothing positive
[1:07:20] being
[1:07:21] anxious you know it's easy it's easy to
[1:07:24] hate depression to be down to hate being
[1:07:26] down there's no I don't see any positive
[1:07:30] emotion that would keep that thing in a
[1:07:32] person right but if you take lust you
[1:07:35] take any kind of lying or gospel or
[1:07:37] something there's something that that
[1:07:39] Spirit gets a thrill when it's expressed
[1:07:41] so it puts a positive emotion in someone
[1:07:44] for it to stay there you're following me
[1:07:47] you know that and that's why people are
[1:07:49] not truly free is because they think
[1:07:52] that thing is one not a spirit and two
[1:07:54] they reason
[1:07:56] they they allow reason to keep it there
[1:07:58] and they like the emotion it produces
[1:08:00] because if people really hated that
[1:08:02] Spirit they'd be free of it right but
[1:08:04] because they like it like it even just a
[1:08:06] little bit it's still got a toe hold in
[1:08:08] their Spirit you know that's why it's a
[1:08:11] big difference between when someone
[1:08:12] really means business with God God comes
[1:08:15] on the scene if someone says they mean
[1:08:17] business with God but they don't
[1:08:19] actually in their heart then then it's
[1:08:21] still going to be there right so it's
[1:08:23] when it's when it's when you really mean
[1:08:25] it in your heart then you can be free of
[1:08:26] something right but if you just vocalize
[1:08:28] it but you still like it and the same
[1:08:30] you want to entertain that thing then
[1:08:32] it's going to then it's going to
[1:08:34] stay right CU some people you know no
[1:08:36] doubt they say well I've prayed about
[1:08:38] this thing I want it to go but do you
[1:08:39] really want it to go I'm not looking at
[1:08:41] anyone particular I'm just saying you
[1:08:42] see we can't have any positive emotion
[1:08:44] towards any demon power any thought of
[1:08:47] the devil anything we can't think
[1:08:48] there's anything good of it right
[1:08:50] because that keeps the door
[1:08:53] open okay see
[1:08:56] so demons call out for help they're
[1:08:59] trying to and that's why that's why you
[1:09:01] see people who have the same I'm not
[1:09:04] saying people will demon possess but
[1:09:05] Spirits can bother people and they'll
[1:09:07] begin to congregate with each other cuz
[1:09:10] that's actually demons calling for help
[1:09:12] I'll stay by you you stay by me and
[1:09:14] that's how Fellowship is formed around
[1:09:15] those things so we can't we can't
[1:09:19] allow we can't think we can manage
[1:09:23] sin we can't think that we can't think
[1:09:26] I'll be all right I'll get over this
[1:09:27] I'll mature I'll grow up no it'll just
[1:09:30] become
[1:09:31] nastier right you take a child who's got
[1:09:34] a vindictive streak and it's more than a
[1:09:36] personality but there's a evil in it
[1:09:39] what what has that become if it's not
[1:09:41] dealt with they'll kill someone they'll
[1:09:43] do something they'll terrorize someone
[1:09:45] they'll you know they'll be a bully
[1:09:47] they'll manipulate spiritually all those
[1:09:49] kind of things because it's it's matured
[1:09:51] now it was just oh it's just a little
[1:09:54] kid no but there's something in that
[1:09:55] that needs to be something needs to that
[1:09:57] that child needs help needs some love
[1:09:59] needs some care needs some guidance or
[1:10:00] something that they can be free of that
[1:10:03] thing you
[1:10:06] see so I'm just going to I'm going to
[1:10:09] just finish with one more so we you must
[1:10:11] be careful well well I'm just going to
[1:10:13] say I'm winding up because I don't say
[1:10:14] that but I'm going to say I'm just
[1:10:15] winding up I want you to think about
[1:10:17] this you're known by The Company You
[1:10:19] Keep okay birds of a feather flock
[1:10:22] together what do you Fellowship on
[1:10:26] you know normally people who are in sin
[1:10:27] try and get other people to join them
[1:10:30] right because a burden shed is a burden
[1:10:32] half so if you're not the only person
[1:10:33] that Spirit wants to
[1:10:35] spread right so what are you what are we
[1:10:37] fellowshipping about what are we sharing
[1:10:40] what's on the inside that wants to come
[1:10:42] out you know are we wanting to I know
[1:10:44] this is a young people and Young At
[1:10:46] Heart Meeting but you know do we the if
[1:10:50] there's like say we have I don't know
[1:10:51] pornographic Spirit L spirit I know what
[1:10:53] it is are you trying to share that with
[1:10:55] other people or gossip or control or
[1:10:57] manipulation or whatever it is is that
[1:11:00] thing motivating your life or is Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ motivating your
[1:11:06] life birds of a feather flock
[1:11:09] together okay so are we letting are we
[1:11:13] letting are we letting Spirits reinforce
[1:11:17] themselves in our lives are we saying
[1:11:19] Lord I want nothing to do with
[1:11:21] that whom the son has set free is free
[1:11:24] indeed
[1:11:25] amen so
[1:11:27] Ammon Ammon allowed that thing to grip
[1:11:31] him so much that it was just looking for
[1:11:33] an outlet and it came out and look at
[1:11:36] the Carnage it caused and even David's
[1:11:39] father was so blindsided by it David
[1:11:41] imagine him he he actually um he
[1:11:44] actually because he didn't think Ammon
[1:11:47] would be this way he allowed this he
[1:11:48] actually told Tam to go
[1:11:51] there so it's a it's a terrible thing
[1:11:55] but I just want to leave it there you
[1:11:56] cannot contain sin you cannot contain
[1:12:01] the devil you cannot rule him he will
[1:12:03] rule you and he'll pop his head out do
[1:12:05] his thing go back and torment you like
[1:12:08] that but he wants you to to like it
[1:12:12] that's why he perverts emotions and and
[1:12:14] desires and all these things I'm just
[1:12:16] going to finish there okay but I want
[1:12:19] you to think about it what are you
[1:12:20] fellowshipping over when you're on this
[1:12:23] with each other what you talking about
[1:12:26] what are you igging each other on to
[1:12:29] do I hope it's Godly I hope you're
[1:12:32] provoking one another to Good Works not
[1:12:35] sinful things in
[1:12:38] secret I hope that okay so let's have
[1:12:42] the musicians this
[1:12:45] afternoon there's a
[1:12:47] reaction you'll get an opposite Rea you
[1:12:50] there's an action there's a reaction
[1:12:56] sin is
[1:12:58] deceiving you can't outsmart the
[1:13:01] devil that's why the Holy Ghost is here
[1:13:04] that's why Jesus is here you just let
[1:13:06] him you just let him take over your life
[1:13:09] you say man I'm try to contain this
[1:13:11] thing for years but the Lord can take it
[1:13:13] from you if you want him to expose the
[1:13:17] devil that's the main thing to do and
[1:13:19] hate it with everything within you
[1:13:22] because the devil what he does it's like
[1:13:24] someone trying to
[1:13:25] I don't know if Christine had this dream
[1:13:26] on I can't remember someone did it's
[1:13:28] like someone in a pit it's like stuck in
[1:13:30] sin they try and climb their way out and
[1:13:32] they finally at the top think finally
[1:13:34] I'm free then the devil just pushes them
[1:13:35] back in it's like someone who thinks
[1:13:37] they're finally free of it it's been
[1:13:38] long enough since it happened before now
[1:13:40] I'm okay but then that thing's still
[1:13:42] there to push them back in what about
[1:13:44] letting letting that thing totally be
[1:13:46] broken that it can't it can't bother you
[1:13:48] see the see the Holy Ghost seals the
[1:13:50] devil
[1:13:51] out right you're sealed in he sealed
[1:13:55] out praise the Lord and if he and if
[1:13:58] you're sealed in then you have the
[1:14:00] strong man of the house the Lord Jesus
[1:14:01] himself on the inside of the inside
[1:14:03] who's there to fight the battle and
[1:14:05] drive that thing away it's not you
[1:14:07] trying to manage things no God manages
[1:14:10] real well and he's in the extermination
[1:14:12] process extermination business amen so
[1:14:15] let's um let's stand um this
[1:14:19] afternoon

[1:14:23] think that's a bit heavy but life his
[1:14:25] life you know the devil's not playing
[1:14:26] games so let's not play games either

[1:14:32] service over you bro if that's right
[1:14:34] amen let's pray let's just let's just
[1:14:36] bow our heads shall we let's all close
[1:14:37] our eyes bow our heads and if you want
[1:14:39] to slip your hand up to the Lord say
[1:14:41] Lord I don't want to try and manage the
[1:14:44] devil try and think I can control him I
[1:14:47] don't want this habit I don't want this
[1:14:48] way I don't want the spirit to motivate
[1:14:50] me I want your Holy Ghost to motivate me
[1:14:53] Lord I don't want to be I I don't want
[1:14:55] to associate with people because of
[1:14:57] spirits calling out but I want to be
[1:14:59] associated with your holy ghost that the
[1:15:00] people that I that I'm associated with
[1:15:03] my friends the birds that I flock with
