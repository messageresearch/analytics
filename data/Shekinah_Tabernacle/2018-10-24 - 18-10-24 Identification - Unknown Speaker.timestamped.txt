[15:26] I wanna keep going but we said we'll do
[15:28] some testimonies in now is the time I
[15:33] want to hear the testimonies let's take
[15:35] our seats um we can do some more worship
[15:37] after this praise the Lord
[15:41] and since we did I think since the
[15:45] Brahmins got one choice
[15:51] [Music]
[15:55] as a song working I never came cool all
[15:59] our hopes renewed the last words and I
[16:02] think that's how I pretty much felt just
[16:04] um I had such a good time at camp and
[16:09] you think you know you're gonna go and
[16:10] cook for 80 people you're thinking okay
[16:12] cool you got to have all the three meals
[16:13] ready and everything and yeah you think
[16:16] it's probably going to be not much time
[16:19] for listening in to the services and
[16:21] entering in but yeah I'm so thankful to
[16:24] the Lord far exceeded my expectations so
[16:26] thank you all for your prayers for camp
[16:28] everybody was very happy with the
[16:30] natural food and the spiritual food that
[16:32] was there by God's grace and it just
[16:36] seemed like every meal you could just
[16:37] see the hand of a thought everything
[16:39] just moved out just perfectly but even
[16:42] from the first opening Scripture at camp
[16:44] I think it was from memory
[16:45] Genesis 22 and he preached on the eye of
[16:50] God and he talked about how it was like
[16:52] hey go beyond a high ROI and thou God
[16:55] seest me and that's spoken to Indy and I
[16:58] a lot over the last little while when
[17:01] our testimony and a couple of years and
[17:04] man just all our hopes renewed you know
[17:07] when you just know man this is the Lord
[17:08] he's just wronged me he sees us he knows
[17:11] the situation I guess this camp for me
[17:13] it was just like that deep trust and the
[17:15] Lord just renewed again it was really
[17:18] cool tiny bit of a funny testimony the
[17:21] brother that was ministering was from
[17:23] the other side of the world in America
[17:24] so he was on a different jet-lagged
[17:25] timetable so and he said I'll make you
[17:28] coffee in the morning brother what time
[17:29] would you like it and when he said 2 nd
[17:31] 6:00 a.m. he was like whoa ok that's he
[17:36] said yet brother will be there and so
[17:38] we're going to be a nicety you're really
[17:39] going to get up caught in a sex he said
[17:41] yeah yeah that'll be fun you just have
[17:43] to show me how to use that coffee
[17:44] machine so it was awesome so we actually
[17:48] was so blessed we only went to bed after
[17:51] 1:00 and we were getting up early and he
[17:53] said ok this is a good time for us to
[17:55] pray and I thought man this is cool I
[17:56] can with stillness of the morning and
[17:58] just to see the Bliss just like we had
[18:01] supernatural times of prayer and there
[18:03] was just odd ones that came in
[18:05] into the kitchen and set with us and
[18:07] prayed in the mornings and one time that
[18:10] really stood out to me was on the last
[18:13] morning the Monday morning of camp I had
[18:16] a really heavy burden on my heart just
[18:18] to pray and I just prayed through a
[18:20] vision of the Lord coming down for the
[18:23] people and anchoring the revelation like
[18:26] that from this time on whatever it was
[18:28] that they needed it would be like an
[18:29] anchor going down into the solid rock
[18:31] and to the word and then they could
[18:33] always bring it back to a tie post and
[18:34] that will be the anchor and it was like
[18:35] when I was praying I saw their anchor so
[18:37] clearly and the rock and it was like
[18:39] this is it you know and and it was
[18:41] interesting because during the service
[18:43] we were just quickly trying to prepare
[18:44] lunch and it was a blessing because the
[18:46] kitchens right next to the sanctuary so
[18:47] we could shut the glass and still kind
[18:50] of hear and prepare at the same time and
[18:52] I was just crying through a service and
[18:53] you versus the Lord just speaking to me
[18:55] and through the whole service just and
[19:00] anyway cutting a long story short I
[19:02] decided at the end of it I just want to
[19:03] go out for prayer you know because he
[19:05] talked about like Abraham and Sierra and
[19:07] there's a vision you have the vision but
[19:10] sometimes in the in-between times you
[19:11] can like like the songs he'd be in
[19:14] disappointment often a disappointment or
[19:16] you know you have an expectation and
[19:17] that's not fulfilled and so sometimes
[19:19] you can get it for discouraged so I just
[19:21] I just mean I thought I'm going to go
[19:22] forward to a prayer just for faith and
[19:24] that the Lord will just help me to hold
[19:26] on then keep for leaving and and as soon
[19:29] as I got up I was the only one that went
[19:30] up first just for prayer and he just
[19:32] took a hold of my wrist and he said to
[19:34] me and I knew it was just the Lord you
[19:37] know when you know the Lord's been - and
[19:38] he said there's a chain and it ties you
[19:41] and this is the anchor and it goes down
[19:43] and there's a solid rock and that's the
[19:45] word and he said you are actually tied
[19:47] to that word and the anchor just holds
[19:49] you and I was like well the exact thing
[19:51] that the Lord had had me so burdened and
[19:53] I was crying when I was praying so good
[19:55] and to Frazer that was for me thank you
[19:57] lord
[19:58] so you know it was the supernatural the
[20:00] whole weekend that's just a small one
[20:01] but I just thought I should have a
[20:02] testimony so yes thank you all for your
[20:04] prayers
[20:06] [Applause]
[20:14] [Music]
[20:16] exactly the same for me the Lord really
[20:19] just blessed me so amazing that before
[20:22] we went to camp I see to the Lord
[20:23] because it's been like as you we've
[20:26] always a church been through quite an
[20:27] emotionally trying time and it's taken
[20:29] its toll and when you didn't even really
[20:31] realize but it's just it's been hard and
[20:34] so I said to the Lord I want to be
[20:36] restore completely back to every single
[20:37] joy have you ever had and you and
[20:39] freedom I've had in you plus greater
[20:40] heights and I've ever had in you before
[20:42] so that's what I want out of camp and I
[20:44] absolutely haven't without a doubt in my
[20:46] mind that's what I'm going to get and
[20:48] Saturday morning I just had to cry
[20:50] through the whole service because it was
[20:51] like it's speaking straight to my heart
[20:53] and then Saturday night oh yeah I went
[20:55] out but PA I don't think they've been
[20:56] able to call but I knew it's for me and
[20:58] that's exactly just everything that he
[21:01] prayed I just felt the Holy Spirit right
[21:02] there and the Lord just spoke to my
[21:04] heart really cleese did you are a
[21:05] believer and it made me think because
[21:08] often have heard in prayer lines brother
[21:10] venom so I can see you're a Christian
[21:11] you're a believer and I always thought
[21:14] be so lovely to hear the prophets say
[21:15] that I can see you're a believer but
[21:17] their sayings God that was in the
[21:19] prophets heed it to me you ever believer
[21:20] and it just boost me so much
[21:26] [Applause]
[21:44] [Music]
[21:48] amen God is so good you know I actually
[21:58] have so many testimonies it was just
[22:01] such a wonderful time and the Lord has
[22:03] undertook for everything and all the
[22:06] cooking everything just went smoothly
[22:08] everything just happened I mean you know
[22:10] we pushed and we worked hard and did all
[22:13] those things too
[22:14] but Allah blistered and you know they
[22:16] were we had such a supernatural time in
[22:19] that kitchen I don't know I'm sure that
[22:21] you guys remember we were just singing
[22:24] in the whole kitchen was in this light
[22:25] stiffened part harmony of these songs
[22:28] and we were just like it was just good
[22:30] it was so nice I think we shaved the
[22:32] video that was only a little tiny
[22:34] snippet but it was like there for about
[22:36] what man this is like such a cool
[22:41] kitchen team when we had alpha on the
[22:45] bass baritone man he was gone for him it
[22:47] was real good
[22:48] he had that bass going right happens
[22:50] with the ceilings and it was just nice
[22:52] but you know I had such I just want to
[22:55] concur with the two sisters with the
[22:59] exact same testimony you know I had a
[23:04] burden on my heart for the people and
[23:07] for myself for all of us because we're
[23:10] all together we're all one and the Lord
[23:13] met those needs and the Lord came on the
[23:15] scene and just just broke all sorts of
[23:19] bondages and just he just loosed his
[23:22] sword and just cut down every devil in
[23:24] it was just amazing such a powerful time
[23:27] and all the prayers that were prayed
[23:31] that the the ministry was just
[23:32] fulfilling those things and just it was
[23:35] it went beyond our expectation and then
[23:39] on a little testimony that blessed my
[23:43] heart it was we were serving I think I
[23:48] told Ben my Top Ramen I told somebody
[23:50] that we were serving and brother Craig
[23:54] came through and I said to him cuz I
[23:56] just I just I knew that the service that
[23:59] morning are serving him dinner at least
[24:01] the service that morning I just I just
[24:03] knew so clear on my heart the word that
[24:06] was being ministered was Hebrews 4:12
[24:08] and it was discerning the thoughts and
[24:11] intents of my heart and just undoing
[24:14] everything and I just knew you know the
[24:16] same word the the gift of the Messiah
[24:19] that was in brother branham's ministry
[24:21] that discerned all those hats all the
[24:23] time that same word was on the scene and
[24:25] it was just undoing things deep life
[24:28] long complexes and all the stuff was
[24:30] just being dealt with and all the pews
[24:33] was going over like this and it was just
[24:34] in it and it didn't pass me by I was
[24:37] sitting there and it I reached out and
[24:40] touched the Lord Amen as he passed by
[24:42] and he handed in his brother Craig we
[24:45] passed I seen brother Craig Hebrews 4:12
[24:47] the Word of God I just recited the whole
[24:51] scripture I felt and he goes like this
[24:54] he goes not like as definitive but it he
[24:58] was taken aback I was at all I wanted to
[25:00] say something wrong and then he kept
[25:04] going and then that night it was his
[25:06] opening scripture whoa
[25:09] man that was differently like a moment
[25:11] you know so yeah the Lord just it was a
[25:14] supernatural time
[25:18] [Applause]
[25:36] praise the Lord there was a worthwhile
[25:39] stop amen I mean later I'm just
[25:46] continuing the atmosphere of the Lord
[25:47] will stand and we'll just sing some
[25:48] worship songs before brother Ben comes

[40:38] service it was like it was just straight
[40:40] for me it was the camp was for me
[40:42] everyone else was there was nice but it
[40:44] was really my camp every service is like
[40:46] he's just talking to me and and even
[40:49] afterwards you know we had a bit of time
[40:51] with brother Craig before we left and
[40:52] he's just it's like he was been in our
[40:55] house seen our lives the past few years
[40:58] it's amazing just as brother Andy said
[41:00] the Word of God is a discerner of
[41:01] thoughts intents of the heart it was
[41:03] incredible and and Sunday night I went
[41:07] up for prayer had a burn I had to go for
[41:08] prayer and I just ask the Lord for a few
[41:11] things and one of them was a revival and
[41:13] the and you know not just for myself but
[41:17] for us and and brother Craig said after
[41:20] you pray see don't go receive your
[41:21] revival and I walked out of there and I
[41:23] said I receive it and the Spirit of God
[41:25] fell upon me and I was that I was
[41:27] rejoicing hallelujah so here I am to
[41:31] receive my revival hallelujah amen so I
[41:36] believe we're in for a great season
[41:38] hallelujah amen it was a glorious as a
[41:42] glorious camp wonderful camp the Lord
[41:46] was very present was just incredible to
[41:48] be there and the Lord knows everything
[41:51] about us hallelujah I'd like to I'd like
[41:55] to read a quote just before we kind of I
[41:58] did write it down with my handwriting
[42:00] scary so I want to I want to read this
[42:03] this is from what shall I do with Jesus
[42:04] called Christ in 1963 it says the
[42:07] dynamics of this church will be a
[42:09] refilling of the Holy Spirit that we
[42:11] have work that we have worked in a small
[42:14] measure while the headstone is coming
[42:16] down to unite with the body but when
[42:18] that head and body unites together the
[42:21] full power of the Holy Ghost will raise
[42:24] her up just exactly like that even the
[42:27] dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds
[42:29] of years ago will rise and the beauty of
[42:31] us holiness and take a flight to the
[42:33] skies the dynamics is the Holy Spirit
[42:37] and I was marveling when I read there
[42:39] because this is it's been in yo it's
[42:41] worked in a small measure and you think
[42:44] what an incredible you know you hear the
[42:46] you know you hear the ministry hear God
[42:48] moving into
[42:49] turning thoughts and teens in the hearts
[42:50] and eyes being formed in sockets and God
[42:53] doing incredible things he's just saying
[42:54] it's just a small measure but it says
[42:57] that's while the head stones coming down
[42:58] we went now we know the heads donors
[43:00] Christ right so while he's coming down
[43:03] to unite with the body but when the head
[43:04] and the body you know it's together the
[43:07] full power of the Holy Ghost amen we'll
[43:11] race her up just exactly like that now I
[43:14] wanted to clear to you I don't know if
[43:16] you've realized it but we're not looking
[43:18] for a uniting the bride is early United
[43:21] right Authority we're not looking for
[43:23] the future event I meant when the when
[43:25] the message came your way and faith rose
[43:28] and you gave yourself to him and you met
[43:30] the Lord Jesus Christ but where he's
[43:48] working small measure but in full
[43:50] measure now I'd like to speak tonight on
[43:53] identification it's got a hebrews
[43:58] chapter 2 it's gonna read a bit of
[44:00] scripture now we read there and I'm Luke
[44:01] 6 um or maybe I mean we will come back
[44:04] to that dear but I just like to read
[44:07] from Hebrews 2 7 to 18 because now you
[44:12] know identification you become what
[44:17] you're identified with I just say that
[44:19] servant you become what you identified
[44:21] with so if you're identified with just
[44:23] religion you become religious if you're
[44:25] identified with the world you become
[44:27] like the world if you identify with
[44:28] Jesus Christ and living word you'll
[44:30] become like him right so now Paul says
[44:34] in Hebrews 2 from verse 7 thou made us
[44:37] some speaking of the Lord Jesus thou
[44:39] made us some a little lower than the
[44:41] Angels thou Kronus him with glory and
[44:43] honor and did a set him over the works
[44:45] of thy hands thou has put all things in
[44:48] subjection under his feet for in that
[44:51] before in there he put all in subjection
[44:54] under him he left nothing there does not
[44:57] put under him but now we see not yet all
[44:59] things under him but we see Jesus who
[45:02] was made a little lower than the Angels
[45:04] for the suffering of death crowned with
[45:06] glory and honor that he by the grace of
[45:09] God should taste death for every man for
[45:12] it became him for whom are all things
[45:14] and by are all things and bringing many
[45:17] sons unto glory to make the captain of
[45:20] their salvation perfect through
[45:22] sufferings for both he that sanctifies
[45:24] and they who are sanctified to all of
[45:26] one for which course he is not ashamed
[45:29] to call them brethren so he's
[45:31] identifying himself with the people
[45:32] saying I'll declare thy name unto my
[45:35] brethren in the midst of the church
[45:36] while I sing praise unto thee and again
[45:39] I will put my trust in him and again
[45:42] behold I and the children which God have
[45:43] given me for as much sin as the children
[45:46] are partakers of flesh and blood he also
[45:48] himself likewise took part of the same
[45:50] that through death he might destroy him
[45:52] that had the power of death that is the
[45:55] devil and deliver them who who through
[45:59] fear of death were all their lifetime
[46:00] subject to bondage bondage for verily he
[46:04] took not on him the nature of angels be
[46:07] took on him the seed of Abraham
[46:08] wherefore in all things it behooves him
[46:11] to be made like unto his brethren that
[46:13] he might be a merciful and faithful high
[46:15] priest and things pertaining to God to
[46:18] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[46:21] people and that he himself having
[46:24] suffered being tempted he is able to
[46:27] secure which means help them that
[46:29] attempted so now we God identifies
[46:33] himself with his bride God has invested
[46:36] himself in you he's identified himself
[46:39] in a you know not just with the people
[46:42] but in a people so we read there he's
[46:44] not ashamed to call the church his
[46:47] brethren he's not ashamed to call us his
[46:49] family holy he's not ashamed to say this
[46:52] is mine i redeemed me my birth them into
[46:55] the earth
[46:56] I made them born again by my spirit
[46:58] they're part of me he's not ashamed to
[47:00] say that now identification this is from
[47:03] this is just from a dictionary it's the
[47:05] action or process of identifying
[47:08] something so it's the action or process
[47:10] of identifying something and so when the
[47:13] Holy Ghost comes upon you the Bible says
[47:16] he sent forth the spirit of adoption
[47:18] where we cry Abba Father or my father my
[47:21] father so in the spirit of the Holy
[47:23] Ghost comes upon you you respond back
[47:25] god you're my father
[47:26] I'm identified with you you're my father
[47:29] I'm your child I'm your bride we're the
[47:32] same family I mean we're not wandering
[47:34] separate kind of you know but we're one
[47:37] amen and it's also a person's sense of
[47:40] identity now we won't read it but in
[47:43] mark 16 Jesus Jesus gives his last
[47:46] commission to the church and he tells
[47:48] them to go into all the world and to
[47:49] preach the gospel and these signs shall
[47:51] follow in the belief so it's not just
[47:54] not just the ministry but them that
[47:56] believed these signs shall follow and
[47:58] then after he lists down about speaking
[48:00] tongues and casting out Devils and you
[48:02] know you know treat it you know you pick
[48:05] up serpents and they will not harm you
[48:07] and different things he says and he went
[48:09] working with them confirming the word so
[48:11] God was in the apostles our Lord Jesus
[48:13] was in the apostles identify himself
[48:15] with that what the world would call a
[48:17] bunch of ragtag people amen but he
[48:21] identified himself with them saying
[48:22] these are mine this is my body upon the
[48:25] earth this is my word made flesh I'm
[48:27] proud to be identified with them
[48:29] hallelujah so God is God is not ashamed
[48:32] to be identified with you I mean many
[48:35] times - oh Lord I want to you know
[48:37] sometimes we think how could God be want
[48:39] to be identified with me he wasn't be
[48:41] identified with you that's why he went
[48:43] to Calvary took your sins upon himself
[48:45] to bridge the gulf break down the middle
[48:49] wall of partition that he can come and
[48:51] dwell in you hallelujah so I'm glad our
[48:54] God wants to identify himself on us now
[48:58] we have come to a time where God through
[49:02] the church ages has been revealing
[49:04] himself in part but as he was the son of
[49:07] man in the beginning he's the son of man
[49:09] in the end and the son of man has
[49:11] manifested through a multi-member body
[49:13] right so what he wasn't parked down the
[49:16] church ages this is fullness manifesting
[49:18] now see everything he was in the
[49:20] beginning he is in the end everything he
[49:22] was and the bridegroom he is in the
[49:24] bride hallelujah so it's not a we we
[49:27] have not been you know we are be
[49:30] restored to the original right so the
[49:33] original God came down and well to this
[49:35] church God called ministry and sent them
[49:38] forth God commissioned them to gun to
[49:40] all the world preach the gospel and they
[49:41] were led by the Spirit of God right and
[49:44] they cast out the devil wherever he was
[49:46] found
[49:47] hallelujah you know I want her life I
[50:39] want a life that stirs them up hey
[50:41] we must give them a good
[50:45] [Music]
[50:49] hallelujah you know really we want the
[50:52] devil to breathe a sigh of relief I'm
[50:54] glad those people are out of here I'm
[50:57] I'm go ahead Oh amen so he mustn't plow
[51:01] through shouldn't we you see the
[51:03] Apostles that that Pentecost Peter
[51:05] didn't bring out some scholarly sermon
[51:08] the first first church service you know
[51:10] when he said this is that spoken by the
[51:12] Prophet Joel holier they had zeal they
[51:15] had a real gumption about them they had
[51:17] a fire they knew who they were you know
[51:20] God God fills you with the Holy Spirit
[51:22] exclaiming part of himself right he's
[51:25] laying claim on you he says this bit
[51:27] belongs to me
[51:28] I mean not just a potential well maybe
[51:30] we'll see how they go on there you know
[51:32] I will just let them go to your
[51:34] performance-based your probation period
[51:36] noises this is mine
[51:38] pearly this is mine this pit belongs to
[51:40] me I mean to win you realize that he is
[51:42] your father
[51:43] your as child that should make us
[51:45] invincible doesn't matter what the devil
[51:48] throws that you should be something in
[51:49] your heart I'm going to serve God no
[51:51] matter what I can be on my deathbed I
[51:53] could be destitute I could be whatever
[51:56] I'm going to serve God holy I'm going to
[51:59] rejoice in the God of my salvation
[52:00] that's how we should be
[52:03] haloo you you know we're here to praise
[52:06] the Lord we must praise Him hallelujah
[52:09] what's your job I'm here to praise God
[52:11] I'm not gonna let rocks cry out in my
[52:13] place they marvelous sing better than me
[52:15] but I'm gonna cry out hallelujah you
[52:19] know we are the last well for the
[52:22] Gentiles we are the last manifestation
[52:24] of a Gentile bride we've been this
[52:27] living God is coming to us it's been
[52:29] he's been passed down through the ages I
[52:31] use just the Shannons Sunday School
[52:33] thing with the boys at camp about
[52:35] passing the bed and let us run and you
[52:38] know it's been handed to us you may not
[52:40] be looking for the bed and but the bed
[52:42] and found you this word found you
[52:44] hallelujah we don't just carry the word
[52:46] we become the word hallelujah so we
[52:49] mustn't run we mustn't live this life
[52:51] you say well I'm not ordained to preach
[52:53] you can live a sermon you can live
[52:55] Redemption howl ooh you
[52:59] why not let's do a good job hallelujah
[53:03] well I know this why not push the battle
[53:05] why not press it why not run hallelujah
[53:08] it's all about the you know we don't
[53:11] want to put God in a box
[53:12] Abraham Otis was 80 years old that's a
[53:16] long time but then finally God found him
[53:18] and the last 40 years of his life was
[53:21] very different to the first 80 right the
[53:24] first 80 he was he was Prince of Egypt
[53:26] then he is a shepherd on the backside of
[53:28] the desert and then God met him he knew
[53:32] he was called to be the deliverer but
[53:33] then God met him and he did God did
[53:35] thinks through him now I don't even know
[53:37] if he imagined it cuz he had in his mind
[53:39] when he hit 40 he says now I'm gonna you
[53:41] know you know he killed the one Egyptian
[53:43] he once he uses military might his own
[53:45] ability to deliver Israel it failed
[53:48] miserably but that's that's that's what
[53:50] his imagination was we're gonna kill
[53:53] this one though rally to me we're going
[53:54] to storm the garrison we'll get the arms
[53:56] maybe you know but then when God came to
[53:59] him in the burning bush is very
[54:00] different so we don't want to put God in
[54:02] a box hallelujah God can do anything now
[54:08] God identifies himself with his children
[54:11] we read in in in Abraham we know Abraham
[54:16] became bkm became Abraham Sarah I became
[54:21] Sarah and God identified himself by
[54:27] adding an H into their names and that
[54:30] speaks of God's breath so he breathed on
[54:34] them just like Adam was made out of
[54:35] formed out the dusty earth that God
[54:37] breathed into him the breath of life he
[54:38] became a living soul
[54:39] and then now has his Abraham and Sarah
[54:44] [Music]
[55:00] part of God's name is in mine so he is
[55:03] Aerith he is joining himself with the
[55:06] promise for that hour hallelujah so he
[55:09] breathed on them
[55:10] hey you could say by adding that H there
[55:13] means speaks of the Hebrew for the
[55:15] breath of God just like he breathed on
[55:17] Adam and then Jesus now before he but
[55:22] you know before he ascends up after the
[55:23] resurrection he breathed on his
[55:25] disciples and said receive ye the Holy
[55:27] Ghost and they went to Pentecost and
[55:29] they received the Holy Ghost see his
[55:31] breathing on them just like when he made
[55:33] the first man and he put the H into
[55:35] Abraham and Sarah's baby so I'm going to
[55:37] put my my breath in you that you will
[55:40] fulfill the promise of the day and I'm
[55:44] sure you can agree they did fulfill the
[55:45] promise of the day hallelujah they had
[55:47] the promise and it's incredible where
[55:50] God the spirit of God blows where it
[55:52] will you cannot see where it comes from
[55:54] you cannot see where it goes
[55:55] you know just like the wind so as
[55:58] everyone that's born of the Spirit of
[55:59] God so the Spirit of God blows into a
[56:01] place people are birthed hallelujah and
[56:05] then now there's a people and now here
[56:08] we are
[56:09] amen here we are and now we're not
[56:12] called to sit idle you know New Zealand
[56:14] punches above its weight in a lot of
[56:17] ways I think we should do the same thing
[56:20] hallelujah amen
[56:23] we have a responsibility to get this
[56:25] word out amen we have a responsibility
[56:28] to find the last one wouldn't that be
[56:31] cool if we found the last one we did we
[56:34] found them we did wouldn't that be
[56:38] wonderful
[56:39] hallelujah amen so what you know why not
[56:42] us why not here this is a country of
[56:45] immigrants
[56:47] Amen I mean I'm a son of an immigrant a
[56:51] lot of us are Amen so why not now now as
[57:01] I said we are now living in the time of
[57:03] the full measure where the Holy Spirit
[57:06] we've been united with the head the
[57:08] headstone is here the capstone is here
[57:11] right we have the devil's answer brother
[57:13] Brown
[57:13] is encrusted mr. Gaad reveal he says we
[57:16] have the living resurrected Jesus Christ
[57:18] that kept stone us here because the
[57:20] Devils out you know yeah because it did
[57:22] last the question if they'll be are you
[57:24] really a believer I said yeah I've been
[57:25] identified with the headship the heat
[57:27] chip is here over the body I mean the
[57:29] life of God and a people answers all the
[57:32] devil's questions right because he asked
[57:34] well are you really are you really Bluff
[57:36] said the life in me proves I am cuz yet
[57:39] God has identified himself with me
[57:42] hallelujah so Abraham and Sarah they
[57:45] went through great adversity Abraham
[57:47] waited 25 years but he was patient
[57:50] looking for the promise to be fulfilled
[57:52] and it's the same thing with us though
[57:54] them though the promise may tarry right
[57:57] God is willing to teach us patience just
[58:00] because it doesn't happen straight away
[58:02] doesn't mean your faith has not been
[58:03] received it does not mean your prayer
[58:05] has not been I'm heard the answer is on
[58:08] its way
[58:09] amen Daniel was praying for about 20 odd
[58:11] days I may get the figure wrong but the
[58:14] angel was trying to get to him to give
[58:15] him the answer but Satan was blocking
[58:17] the visitation of the angel but he
[58:19] stayed in prayer right it should be the
[58:22] same thing with us though the enemy may
[58:24] try and block the answer right we should
[58:26] stay in prayer getting ahold of God
[58:29] hallelujah I'm glad that that's the case
[58:33] we should keep pressing on Abraham was
[58:35] 25 you know he was a hundred years old
[58:37] when he had Isaac amen and he was strong
[58:40] giving faith to God fully persuaded he
[58:43] was able to do that which he is promised
[58:44] I mean so we should be the same way so
[58:48] don't be don't be downcast if it's one
[58:51] day and then it's two days and then
[58:54] three I'm not gonna do that for 25 years
[58:57] old Lewis County but don't don't become
[58:59] downcast you should be it's even more
[59:02] impossible now than it was the first day
[59:06] hallelujah just just be strong giving
[59:09] God praise God has identified himself
[59:11] through seven Church eight down through
[59:13] seven Church changes and his people he
[59:16] identified himself with Luther he
[59:18] identified himself with Wesley he
[59:20] identified himself with the Azusa Street
[59:22] movement and he identified himself with
[59:24] the Prophet messenger brother ham said
[59:26] that on their high river
[59:27] hee hee just have to beat it when he
[59:29] turned up right it wasn't brother
[59:31] Brandon during it was God doing it why
[59:34] was God coming to the earth and a
[59:36] greater far greater ministry than any
[59:38] other contemporary of the Prophet
[59:40] because God was trying to get your
[59:42] attention Here I am I'm looking for my
[59:44] bride Here I am I'm looking for my body
[59:46] I'm come to get her and take her away
[59:49] holy that's wise put on tape because is
[59:52] because spirits travel on words write
[59:55] the words I speak to you Jesus in that
[59:57] spirit of my life I mean so it just
[1:00:00] wasn't your this this spirits travel on
[1:00:02] words that's why it's recorded on tape
[1:00:04] because there's a life that travels on
[1:00:06] that word and when that word has
[1:00:08] received in faith thus the Holy Spirit
[1:00:09] comes I mean it quickens that word to
[1:00:12] our souls hallelujah
[1:00:15] he says at the end of his ministry
[1:00:17] modern events made clear by prophecy he
[1:00:21] speaks about many times speaks about the
[1:00:23] body of Christ being built through seven
[1:00:25] Church ages he says now we're not in the
[1:00:26] feet we're not in the arms right we're
[1:00:30] up now in the head and he says it's
[1:00:33] fixing to go he says and now it's in the
[1:00:35] head fixing to go manifesting and full
[1:00:39] measure the bride the same as from the
[1:00:42] beginning hallelujah have you looked at
[1:00:45] yourself in the mirror have you
[1:00:48] well actually boy every day I normally
[1:00:50] brush my teeth whatever but we have you
[1:00:52] have you have you looked at yourself in
[1:00:54] this mirror hallelujah because you
[1:00:57] should be able to look at this and say
[1:00:58] this has become flesh right well
[1:01:02] everything that God has prophesied of
[1:01:04] the Bible of a bride has become flesh in
[1:01:07] us how did how did Jesus come here by
[1:01:11] the words of the Prophet says in Matthew
[1:01:15] let's go to Matthew 1 and verse 20
[1:01:29] Matthew 1 and 20 now this is this is
[1:01:34] Joseph here Mary has told him that that
[1:01:36] she's with child he's wondering how this
[1:01:38] can be he's thinking of putting away
[1:01:40] privately bases but while he thought on
[1:01:42] these things behold the angel Lord
[1:01:44] appeared unto Him in a dream saying
[1:01:46] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[1:01:48] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[1:01:50] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:01:52] Ghost and she shall bring forth a son
[1:01:54] and thou shalt call his name Jesus for
[1:01:55] he shall save his people from their sins
[1:01:58] now this was all done that it might be
[1:02:00] fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord
[1:02:02] by the Prophet saying behold a virgin
[1:02:04] shall be with child shall bring forth a
[1:02:06] son they shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:02:08] which is which being interpreted is God
[1:02:10] with us so the body of Christ came to
[1:02:14] the earth through them through the words
[1:02:15] of the Prophet right the words of the
[1:02:18] Prophet brought the body to the earth as
[1:02:20] that Oh keV I say it that way
[1:02:21] because here was the fulfillment of the
[1:02:23] prophecy now we've had now you know this
[1:02:27] entire scripture actually speaks of you
[1:02:29] Ruth was a prophecy of you Rahab is a
[1:02:33] prophecy of you hallelujah Bathsheba is
[1:02:36] a prophecy of you I mean Tama is a
[1:02:38] prophecy of you right and then Paul's
[1:02:41] writings their prophecy of you the bride
[1:02:44] as Christ fulfilled the Old Testament
[1:02:46] brother brems is the bride will fulfill
[1:02:48] the New Testament hallelujah so now
[1:02:50] there's all this prophecy sitting around
[1:02:52] but you know it's like when when Isaiah
[1:02:55] said a virgin shall conceive that word
[1:02:57] circled the earth for about 800 years
[1:02:59] waiting for the right time for the right
[1:03:02] womb hallelujah Mary you know God just
[1:03:05] doesn't like you know what God is not a
[1:03:07] lottery let's do a school raffle did you
[1:03:10] get the ticket I you won congratulations
[1:03:12] yeren that's not how it works with God
[1:03:14] he knows who's gonna fulfill the word
[1:03:17] amen
[1:03:18] he knows so so when when Isaiah spoke a
[1:03:21] virgin shall conceive in God's mind and
[1:03:23] that word was married right so that was
[1:03:25] circling the earth and finally Mary was
[1:03:27] born and in the right season an angel
[1:03:29] goes to her and speaks to her and
[1:03:32] something in her says I believe what
[1:03:33] this man is telling me let it be unto me
[1:03:36] according to thy word
[1:03:37] and she found herself pregnant with the
[1:03:38] baby hallelujah that's the same thing as
[1:03:41] the church has been built that way so
[1:03:44] the bride has been built that way
[1:03:46] right and so now here we are and this is
[1:03:49] why you know never let the valley of the
[1:03:52] spoken word never let it be diminished
[1:03:55] never let it be diminished you have a
[1:03:57] man stand in 1933 Adolf Hitler will you
[1:04:02] know will will risin you know there'll
[1:04:04] be a world war then he'll come to
[1:04:07] mysterious end
[1:04:08] Mussolini will rise up and vaidhi Theo
[1:04:10] Pia fall his feet and then he'll come to
[1:04:13] a shameful end just a few phrases and
[1:04:17] but you know the manpower and the lives
[1:04:20] and the energy of Nations and the war
[1:04:24] effort wasn't a small thing to fight
[1:04:25] World War two there's a super powers
[1:04:28] rising whole whole nations were now were
[1:04:31] geared into total war factories were
[1:04:34] turned into making elements and planes
[1:04:36] and training people and people moved all
[1:04:38] the way around the earth you're fighting
[1:04:39] on distant lands just because of a
[1:04:41] phrase hallelujah amen Moses just is a
[1:04:47] phrase you worship God you worship the
[1:04:49] gods of your neighbors then the Lord
[1:04:51] will take you out of this land in you
[1:04:53] and you've gone to distant lands just a
[1:04:55] phrase you see what happens in Israel
[1:04:58] they begin to worship idols then he
[1:05:00] comes back on down Babylon rises up amen
[1:05:03] have you ever looked at the magnitude of
[1:05:05] this you know sometimes we just skip
[1:05:07] over things you know Daniel sees a
[1:05:09] vision of the Gentile kingdoms to the
[1:05:11] you know frog from near bikinis that
[1:05:13] down to the time of the end
[1:05:14] how long does it take to read that just
[1:05:16] just a few moments and hears people God
[1:05:20] allows them to come to the earth they
[1:05:21] have ambition and they gather knowledge
[1:05:24] and they have different technologies
[1:05:26] different battle tactics whole whole
[1:05:28] people's lives are given we want to see
[1:05:32] our Empire rise will it defeat our
[1:05:33] enemies great effort is put in and then
[1:05:37] when the next Kingdom comes in the
[1:05:39] former Kingdom can't stop them just like
[1:05:41] you look at it has anyone ever looked at
[1:05:44] Alexander the Great
[1:05:45] anyone done any study of Alexander the
[1:05:48] Great
[1:05:48] the Persians could not defeat him
[1:05:50] they had far greater manpower far
[1:05:53] greater Empire but they couldn't defeat
[1:05:55] him you know what it is because the Word
[1:05:58] of God said they would not and the
[1:06:00] Grecians would and waving would invade
[1:06:02] and conquer them didn't matter how much
[1:06:04] they tried to stop it and how much they
[1:06:06] you know planned and they would yeah
[1:06:08] there would have been a lot of generals
[1:06:10] in the Persian army stressing because if
[1:06:13] they've got defeated pulling air he'd
[1:06:14] would have been taken off by the king
[1:06:16] there'd been a lot of people stressing
[1:06:18] how can we defeat this man from Greece
[1:06:19] is like lightning on his horses and all
[1:06:21] these different things they couldn't
[1:06:22] defeat him I'm laboring this for a
[1:06:25] reason they couldn't defeat him no
[1:06:27] matter how hard they tried because the
[1:06:28] Bible prophesied they'd never do it and
[1:06:30] then the Romans came upon the scene the
[1:06:33] Greece could stop them I mean the Greece
[1:06:36] couldn't stop them all of the Jews and
[1:06:38] the Promised Land couldn't stop the
[1:06:40] Romans come in and invade they couldn't
[1:06:42] stop us prophesied they had to be there
[1:06:44] didn't matter how much people tried now
[1:06:46] you come down to the end and now we're
[1:06:49] living the time of the feet of the image
[1:06:51] of the iron and clay mixed together that
[1:06:54] Catholic spirit has gone through the
[1:06:56] whole world and it's partially strong
[1:06:58] partially weak but what happens after
[1:07:01] that is a stone cut out of the mountain
[1:07:02] made without hands it rolls down smites
[1:07:05] the image and the feet that that image
[1:07:08] now is breaking into dust and scared to
[1:07:10] the four winds and that stone becomes a
[1:07:11] great mountain that fills the whole
[1:07:13] earth that is the kingdom of God
[1:07:15] do you think Satan can stop that
[1:07:17] happening just like the just like the
[1:07:20] Persians can stop the Greeks and the
[1:07:22] Greeks can stop the Romans you know the
[1:07:24] devil can't stop the kingdom of God
[1:07:26] being established upon the earth doesn't
[1:07:29] matter how much he tries all the
[1:07:30] unbelief he pumps through the internet
[1:07:32] and the movies of the music and the
[1:07:33] whatever he can't stop it
[1:07:35] he can't stop this bride he can't stop
[1:07:38] you hallelujah he can't stop you coming
[1:07:41] to your position doesn't matter if he
[1:07:43] fights you and withstands you hey this
[1:07:45] is a contest there's a contest between
[1:07:48] God and Satan depends who you yield to
[1:07:51] the pinch is going to get the victory in
[1:07:53] your life hallelujah but we have the
[1:07:55] power in the name of Jesus amen the
[1:07:59] devil can't stop the Bride of Christ
[1:08:02] coming to her position
[1:08:04] was saying to be happy about they think
[1:08:06] you say well I've been fought brother
[1:08:11] Brown say the other day you know we're
[1:08:13] so carefree
[1:08:14] sometimes and then we become a believer
[1:08:15] and then the battles really come again
[1:08:18] we get all tense and you know cuz they
[1:08:20] want to you know that's when the battle
[1:08:21] really happens that's when the criticism
[1:08:24] really happens when you begin to put on
[1:08:25] the word when you become one with him
[1:08:27] that's when the battles really happened
[1:08:30] you say I being fought every day of my
[1:08:31] life
[1:08:32] that's good that means you're not his
[1:08:34] prisoner that means you know the devil's
[1:08:36] prisoner he's trying to defeat you but
[1:08:39] you've got to stand flat-footed in the
[1:08:41] trial stand on the Word of God stand on
[1:08:43] who you are don't back down for nothing
[1:08:46] we're not called to retreat we're call
[1:08:48] to advance amen that every promise that
[1:08:50] belongs to us don't be discouraged don't
[1:08:53] be discouraged you're I wasn't Isaac or
[1:08:56] or Jacob I might be wrong he dug some
[1:08:59] wells he came in and stopped it up the
[1:09:03] sick and well enemy came and stopped
[1:09:05] that third well I think it was then the
[1:09:07] fourth well there's enough for everyone
[1:09:09] hallelujah he kept digging and and he
[1:09:13] finally kept what what was there and
[1:09:15] sometimes the enemy you know we begin to
[1:09:18] because the devil you know we're in a
[1:09:20] battle
[1:09:20] who knows we're in a battle I thought
[1:09:23] this is a sunday-school picnic yeah you
[1:09:25] ever listed in the wrong place I'm glad
[1:09:29] I mean but the bright you know Jesus was
[1:09:33] tempted with on every point yet without
[1:09:37] sin he was tempted by every point
[1:09:39] imaginable he was tempted by every
[1:09:42] spirit every spirit amen
[1:09:45] make it well if you want to ho make a
[1:09:48] list if you want everything that we are
[1:09:50] tempted by he was tempted by because he
[1:09:54] was tempted on all points yet without
[1:09:56] certain now if he was tempted on all
[1:09:59] points
[1:09:59] I'll actually tell you this you'll be
[1:10:01] tempted on all points every spirit in
[1:10:04] this world will try and get you because
[1:10:06] the devil changes his tactic he wrote on
[1:10:09] a white horse in the beginning and then
[1:10:11] he changed and jumped on a red horse and
[1:10:13] killed the hot you're killed with the
[1:10:14] sword and then he and then when he
[1:10:16] realized relax
[1:10:17] this is just making the Christians
[1:10:18] stronger holy tribulations good trials
[1:10:22] are good that's good just like whoa

[1:10:33] his sermon on the eagle stirreth the
[1:10:34] nest well the last ones he did with his
[1:10:36] pastoring and and he said God doesn't
[1:10:39] stir the nest just the trouble the eagle
[1:10:42] he wants to show the eagle the potential
[1:10:43] in it that's why the eagle nests get
[1:10:46] stirred there and one and the mother
[1:10:48] Eagle wants the Eagle to fly it's
[1:10:50] because if the mother wants the baby to
[1:10:52] know what's in it
[1:10:54] amen it's the same thing trials come and
[1:10:56] the devil tries to come against you God

[1:11:20] meant of his salvation and who you are
[1:11:24] in him so now nothing can stop us coming
[1:11:28] to our position so and then the devil
[1:11:33] changes tactic he's on the black horse
[1:11:34] and then it all mix together in the pale
[1:11:36] horse he just changes his ways amen
[1:11:39] and it's the same thing we may be tried
[1:11:42] but you say well I'm sick of fighting
[1:11:44] just keep tapped into your strength
[1:11:46] source we have the victory we have the
[1:11:50] victory I mean it'll be worth it all I

[1:12:05] own house he's nothing but a bluff
[1:12:09] hallelujah and he wants to identify
[1:12:12] himself with you he'll be in the trial
[1:12:14] we all know the story of Shadrach
[1:12:16] Meshach and Abednego God comes at the
[1:12:18] last moment right they're just about to
[1:12:21] be thrown in the fire maybe ask this
[1:12:23] being thrown in there is hallelujah do
[1:12:27] you think Daniel would have traded the
[1:12:28] lion's den after that experience

[1:12:32] King comes the King comes the next
[1:12:34] morning all all distress because I was

[1:12:44] angel of the Lord came stood with me
[1:12:46] this night clothed the mouths of lions
[1:12:48] do you think he would have traded that
[1:12:49] for anything
[1:12:50] hallelujah but you know sometimes you
[1:12:54] look like a hood you know the prophets
[1:12:56] say one time he saw a trial coming and
[1:13:00] God said do you really want to bypass
[1:13:01] this he said no Lord because he knew it
[1:13:05] was molding and shaping his character
[1:13:07] amen but we have mountain tops too you

[1:13:24] glories and we should just rejoice you

[1:13:32] the devil's defeated you're the devil's
[1:13:34] defeated amen
[1:13:36] if God has come to identify you've got a
[1:13:38] look and you know go look through the
[1:13:40] Old Testament who was victorious through
[1:13:42] the Old Testament God was God was
[1:13:45] victorious with Moses God was victorious
[1:13:48] with Joshua God was victorious with
[1:13:50] David God was victorious with Elijah God
[1:13:54] was victorious with Elijah God was
[1:13:56] victorious with all the prophets God was
[1:13:58] victorious and John the Baptist God was
[1:14:00] victorious in Jesus Christ when he
[1:14:02] himself came joy God was victorious and
[1:14:04] the apostles I meant and God has been
[1:14:07] victorious all the way down through the
[1:14:09] church ages because God has been
[1:14:11] manifested in every age amen God was
[1:14:15] victorious in brother parents ministry
[1:14:17] amen
[1:14:18] I don't know if he never would have
[1:14:19] heard of it but it was an evangelist in
[1:14:21] America called Billy Andrews and and he
[1:14:24] was a contemporary brother branham's and
[1:14:26] he used to see like demons like black
[1:14:28] shadows when he was preaching and then
[1:14:31] brother Branham was having a meeting in
[1:14:32] the same place he was and he said well
[1:14:35] I'm Oz we'll go along and he got put up
[1:14:38] in a balcony he never heard of brother
[1:14:39] Brown before he's sitting up in the
[1:14:41] balcony and he sees his a and he's
[1:14:43] looking towards the
[1:14:44] woman there's a door on the side the
[1:14:46] platform and the door comes open and a
[1:14:49] man comes up with a hat and as soon as
[1:14:51] this man took off his hat he's all these
[1:14:53] black streaks flee the building all
[1:14:55] these demons flee away and and and Billy
[1:14:59] Andrew said that's Elijah but as soon as
[1:15:04] the Prophet came onto the platform I
[1:15:37] mean I think we should just rejoice now
[1:15:42] we are identified with the Son of Man as
[1:15:45] we read in the beginning I meant that
[1:15:49] blessed are thee let's go back there and
[1:15:54] then we'll close I'm sorry after a camp
[1:15:57] your rejoicing so much you can't just do
[1:15:58] a bit of a shotgun machine-gun service
[1:16:01] after us cuz you're so full lesson a ye
[1:16:06] when men shall hate you see sometimes we
[1:16:08] take it the wrong way oh they hate me
[1:16:11] we should be sad no you're blessed I
[1:16:14] mean blessed are ye when men shall hate
[1:16:17] you and when they shall separate you
[1:16:19] from their company we just can't be
[1:16:22] friends anymore and shall reproach you
[1:16:24] and cast out your name as evil saying
[1:16:27] bad things about you blessed hallelujah
[1:16:30] for the son of man's sake no no it
[1:16:32] doesn't say that God's sake or Jesus
[1:16:34] sake the son of man's sake it's always
[1:16:37] when God manifests himself as the son of
[1:16:39] man that's where the controversy comes
[1:16:42] as to whether approach comes that's when
[1:16:44] they you know the questions come because
[1:16:47] how God manifests himself was always
[1:16:49] different to what man thinks he should
[1:16:50] be doing I mean and the son of man has
[1:16:53] been revealed in this day this messages
[1:16:55] son of man Jesus Christ revealed right
[1:16:58] so when they shall reproach you cast out
[1:17:00] your name as evil for the son of man's
[1:17:03] sake amen I'm blessed every day I'm
[1:17:06] blessed rejoicing in that day
[1:17:10] hallelujah rejoice ye in that day for
[1:17:14] behold your reward is great in heaven
[1:17:16] for an alike manner did their fathers
[1:17:18] unto the prophets he's saying in this
[1:17:21] day when they cast your name out of evil
[1:17:24] as evil and they reproach you and they
[1:17:26] hate you for the son of man say you're
[1:17:29] to rejoice and leap for joy don't just
[1:17:32] be a little bit happy be happy
[1:17:34] hallelujah leap for joy what but but
[1:17:38] then why shall we leap for joy because
[1:17:40] your reward is great in heaven as
[1:17:42] brother Ram was told when he preached a
[1:17:45] meeting and a and a man Karthik Danny
[1:17:47] Henry came up said brother Bram I don't
[1:17:49] want to sound sacrilegious but that
[1:17:51] could be the another chapter on the book
[1:17:53] of Revelation he spoke in French he
[1:17:55] spoke in tongues he didn't know French
[1:17:57] there's a French interpreter for the UN
[1:17:59] a speaking lady from Louisiana was here
[1:18:02] and then another man and they and they
[1:18:05] wrote down the interpretation it is
[1:18:07] because thou has chosen the harder way

[1:18:26] great portion of the word awaits you and
[1:18:29] this will bring for the great victory in
[1:18:31] love divine hallelujah so so so what is
[1:18:37] what is it then that your reward is
[1:18:39] great in heaven it's because if you
[1:18:42] stand with him and
[1:19:00] [Music]

[1:19:12] it was worth it it was worth it it'll be
[1:19:15] worth it all and it's worth it now
[1:19:17] I would rather at peace with God ow I
[1:19:19] mean there's nothing between my soul
[1:19:21] with my savior I don't have to make
[1:19:23] anything right he made it right
[1:19:24] hallelujah I don't have to worry about
[1:19:27] whatever men will say about me what does
[1:19:28] he say about me hallelujah so it'll be
[1:19:32] worth it there's a great reward in
[1:19:34] heaven I mean that's why we should leap
[1:19:36] for joy hallelujah
[1:19:41] I'll finish what this is from the
[1:19:44] masterpiece God's making your
[1:19:45] masterpiece do you know how Lou you
[1:19:48] should put yourself in a frame as do you
[1:19:53] look at yourself as a masterpiece of his
[1:19:55] word you should do he should do because
[1:20:00] the devil wants to beat us down you know
[1:20:03] oh we just sit has saved by grace we
[1:20:06] asked in a saved by grace but we're not
[1:20:07] just sinners saved by grace
[1:20:09] right we are the Bride of Christ called
[1:20:12] where are the elected ones we are the
[1:20:14] cold ones where the justified ones with
[1:20:16] the glorified ones with the redeemed
[1:20:19] ones
[1:20:19] we're maintenance image we are the
[1:20:21] feminists part of him right we were
[1:20:24] sinners one time but now I'm not that
[1:20:26] person I'm not her I don't know who that
[1:20:29] that God died and I'm not resuscitating
[1:20:31] and I'm not I'm not harvesting organs
[1:20:34] either he can stay as he was right but
[1:20:37] I'm not that person one day the old
[1:20:39] being Lord died holy the new one lives
[1:20:42] it's not me it's Christ that liveth in
[1:20:44] me hallelujah so one time we were sinner
[1:20:47] and we're still saved by grace I'm not
[1:20:48] diminishing that but some people they
[1:20:51] just kind of beaten down I'm just a
[1:20:52] sinner saved by grace
[1:20:53] you just stand on your feet God doesn't
[1:20:56] want these jellyfish floating through
[1:21:07] where's the battle this person you gotta
[1:21:15] overcome something amen
[1:21:18] and so we're here to be overcomers right
[1:21:23] now we're over comers he said I feel
[1:21:25] like an overcomer do you still believe
[1:21:27] he's still walking with the Lord are
[1:21:31] your eyes fixed on him all you want to
[1:21:34] do is live for him
[1:21:35] that's overcoming you know that's
[1:21:37] overcoming because there's a multitude
[1:21:39] of voices saying don't go that way
[1:21:41] there's nothing to it it's just a bunch
[1:21:43] of excitement it'll burn out one day how
[1:21:46] do you know it's real question question
[1:21:47] question question and you say well I met
[1:21:49] him I met the Lord Jesus Christ he's
[1:21:52] called me I responded to that call
[1:21:55] hallelujah I know it's real I know he is
[1:21:59] real and it take him four thousand years
[1:22:04] to make this masterpieces speaking of
[1:22:06] the Lord Jesus now he's been for nearly
[1:22:08] two thousand years making another
[1:22:10] masterpiece a bride for Christ another
[1:22:12] masterpiece and so doing he does it by
[1:22:14] his never-changing method the same way
[1:22:17] he made the masterpieces word that's the
[1:22:20] way he makes his masterpiece because he
[1:22:22] can only be a perfect masterpiece when
[1:22:24] it's a perfect word so he's been making
[1:22:27] a perfect masterpiece as he said the
[1:22:29] only way he can do make a perfect one is
[1:22:31] by a perfect word well had he knows a
[1:22:33] perfect word we hear these words if I've
[1:22:36] told the truth and I'd be a servant of
[1:22:38] God let him come down and prove that
[1:22:40] it's true and it happened to multiple
[1:22:42] times in front of multiple thousands of
[1:22:44] people God came down the platform to say
[1:22:46] I'm identified with this messenger I am
[1:22:49] not ashamed to say he is preaching my
[1:22:51] work and he came down and he vindicated
[1:22:53] it and he vindicated it and Eve
[1:22:55] indicated saying this is me this is not
[1:22:57] her who's who's heard the last part of
[1:23:00] looking to the unseen in 1959 brother
[1:23:02] Browns making an altar call and then yes
[1:23:04] it's come down when he come down he says
[1:23:06] don't you feel impulse 18q and his voice
[1:23:08] changes he says I'm the Lord God that
[1:23:10] raised Christ from the grave
[1:23:12] you know william branham has nothing to
[1:23:13] do with this he's just treated his life
[1:23:15] to me that I'm just using his lips it's
[1:23:17] me I'm the Lord and it comes back in
[1:23:20] brother Brent speaks come down come down
[1:23:22] so he God is saying the man has nothing
[1:23:24] to do with it
[1:23:25] bro Graham said I wanted to be a trapper
[1:23:27] I never wanted to be like this God but
[1:23:30] God took him and he gave him his life
[1:23:32] and God stepped into that vessel to
[1:23:34] speak to you to speak to I he says this
[1:23:37] wasn't my idea comes to the seals he
[1:23:39] said I had one idea about it then he
[1:23:41] came down to the room and showed me what
[1:23:43] the seals were night after night he
[1:23:44] showed me what it was you know cuz God
[1:23:47] is saying this is me hallelujah and
[1:23:51] that's how you know it's a perfect word
[1:23:53] is because the perfect one comes in
[1:23:56] behind us and says this is me and then
[1:24:00] also you be able to say this is molding
[1:24:02] me this is changing me from glory to
[1:24:05] glory hallelujah I'm not going down with
[1:24:07] the world I'm going up hallelujah I'm

[1:24:23] world that's why there's such a gulf he
[1:24:25] says the years grab by the world goes
[1:24:27] this way and we're looking at we say how
[1:24:29] can this happen and we're going up
[1:24:30] there's a gulf you know brother M sees a
[1:24:36] vision of the preview of the bride he
