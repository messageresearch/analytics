[24:03] God bless you amen
[24:06] happy birthday hallelujah amen let's go
[24:11] to the book of Ephesians chapter 1 just
[24:16] as we're turning just a reminder we're
[24:17] going to have communion and foot washing
[24:19] this Friday at 7 p.m. here and then
[24:23] there's going to be the regular service
[24:24] on Sunday morning amen
[24:27] what if I'm to be alive
[24:33] Ephesians chapter 1 we we we read this
[24:36] on Sunday that's why I go a little bit
[24:40] further
[24:42] Ephesians 1 we're going to read verses 4
[24:45] to 6 and then we're going to go to first
[24:46] Corinthians 13 he says as he has sorry
[24:52] as if one's everyone there they mean so
[24:55] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4
[24:56] according as he has chosen us in him
[24:58] before the foundation of the world that
[25:01] we should be holy and without blame
[25:02] before him and love having predestinated
[25:04] us unto the adoption of children by
[25:08] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[25:11] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[25:13] of the glory of His grace wherein he
[25:16] hath made us accepted in the beloved
[25:19] licious just read the next verse as well
[25:20] and whom we have redemption through his
[25:22] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[25:25] to the riches of His grace amen and
[25:28] let's just go to 1st Corinthians chapter
[25:30] 13 when I read to 2 verses 12 and 12 and
[25:34] 13 just a bit of a bit of a context
[25:48] so first Corinthians 13 12 and 13 it is
[25:55] for now we see through a glass darkly
[25:57] but then face to face now I know in part
[26:01] but then shall I know even as also I am
[26:05] known
[26:05] and now abideth faith hope and charity
[26:07] these three the greatest of these is
[26:10] charity amen may the Lord have a
[26:12] blessing in his word you may you may
[26:14] have your seats tonight so I'd like to
[26:17] can continue where I left off kind of on
[26:21] on Sunday or maybe expand a few things I
[26:24] want to talk about the adoption of
[26:25] children or the placing of a child we
[26:29] are we are living in a in a wonderful
[26:31] season I was thinking I've been thinking
[26:35] about Easter and you know we want to
[26:36] talk about what Easter what whoa what he
[26:39] came to achieve when he died and he was
[26:42] buried in a rose again what was the
[26:43] achievement you know you know what was
[26:46] his purpose in doing that and we know
[26:47] that it was it was not only to wash us
[26:50] of our washes of our unbelief of our
[26:52] sins and but it was also to place us in
[26:55] a position in him and so this so the
[26:59] bride of Jesus Christ in this season I
[27:01] believe is manifesting the purpose of
[27:05] Calvary amen so the purpose of Calvary
[27:08] is that God would Redeemer people back
[27:10] to himself back to where they should
[27:12] have been in the beginning which is
[27:14] joint heirs with him Alleluia
[27:16] that they would be seated in heavenly
[27:18] places in Christ Jesus that they would
[27:20] be placed in the family of God where
[27:23] where their name on the chick was as
[27:25] good as the father's name because they
[27:27] had the mind of the Father they knew
[27:29] it's like a like if if you have a family
[27:31] business and and the father has maybe
[27:33] built the business up and he knows
[27:34] exactly how it all should go but then he
[27:37] has children and he wants those children
[27:39] to be trained and eventually when they
[27:41] come to age he can pass the business on
[27:43] to them or they can manifest his will I
[27:46] mean of what the business should be
[27:48] because he knows what they think about
[27:50] the business is what he thinks about the
[27:52] business amen so it's the same thing now
[27:54] when it comes to a placing of a people
[27:56] is that the is that the bride comes
[27:59] through the position where they know
[28:00] exactly
[28:01] what the will of God is and how to
[28:03] implement it upon the earth Alleluia
[28:06] amen so now but part of this really is
[28:09] knowing knowing as as Peters Paul said
[28:14] in first Corinthians 13 here that then
[28:17] shall I know even as also I am known
[28:20] and this is this age where you should
[28:22] know you you you know about yourself as
[28:25] God knows you and we know in the
[28:28] scripture where God thinks the thought
[28:30] is not just a nice you know a nice idea
[28:32] about someone who can change with time
[28:34] and you know change with emotion that's
[28:36] not God's thoughts when God thinks
[28:39] something that is it that is it and it's
[28:41] completeness I mean that's and it's
[28:43] fullness and it just has to be
[28:45] manifested upon the earth so when it
[28:47] says in Jeremiah that my thoughts
[28:49] towards your a peace I mean that you
[28:51] would receive an expected end there's
[28:53] not him just thinking are they lovely
[28:55] people I think nice things about you and
[28:57] it's going to be a peace and you'll have
[28:58] a nice you know expect it in no goddess
[29:01] thinking when he says at you that a
[29:02] sauce towards you are I know who you are
[29:05] and me I mean I I predestinated you to a
[29:08] specific position in me that you'd
[29:10] become joint heirs with me I mean that's
[29:12] my thoughts towards you being peace that
[29:15] you had come to unexpected end only that
[29:18] expected Enders ruling and reigning with
[29:20] him I mean that is sitting down and his
[29:22] throne as he sat down and his Father's
[29:25] throne
[29:26] Alleluia so now we have to come to a
[29:30] place now we understand that you know we
[29:35] have to come to a place where we go
[29:37] beyond just saying that we're sinners
[29:38] saved by grace we know we're sinners
[29:40] saved by grace but if you just keep
[29:43] saying well I'm just as soon as saved by
[29:45] grace you know it can produce it can
[29:48] produce a false humility and it actually
[29:51] produces some kind of slave mentality
[29:52] and seed of a victorious overcoming
[29:55] mentality I mean when someone knows that
[29:57] they're a son or daughter of the king it
[29:59] doesn't make them arrogant it doesn't
[30:01] make them proud it makes them humble but
[30:03] they know who they are I mean they're
[30:05] not pushovers by the devil they're not
[30:08] just pushed around by every spirit that
[30:09] would come along and honor in my hair
[30:11] believe they know who they are and who I
[30:14] mean
[30:14] not pushed her out magic going mention
[30:17] going to you know the rule family in
[30:19] England and trying to push maybe just
[30:22] say if William was the next in line just
[30:23] going on I'm pushing him off saying
[30:25] you're not good on here at this turn
[30:26] it's mine he would look at you and say
[30:29] get out of here boy
[30:30] I mean his the the Kings I mean the
[30:33] Queen's blood flows through my veins I
[30:35] mean I have the paperwork to prove I am
[30:38] in line for this throne because I know
[30:39] who I am
[30:41] hallelujah he won did he push rugger oh
[30:43] okay you can have it you know and we
[30:46] know he'll he'll stand for his rights
[30:49] that he believes he has it should be
[30:51] even more so by us we're not here doing
[30:54] here at some earthly throne that'll pass
[30:55] away we're here to overcome and sit in a
[30:58] heavenly throne hallelujah so we should
[31:00] know who we are and God wants us to know
[31:03] who we are a mint so we shouldn't just
[31:06] walk around say well we're just enough
[31:08] saved by grace we are but we don't stay
[31:09] there and then we grow we grow into what
[31:13] we meant to be we're not you know we
[31:15] shouldn't walk around with a false
[31:16] humility and a defeated attitude amen
[31:20] you know I'm not good I'm just a sinner
[31:23] that's what people say but God doesn't
[31:25] want us just to be sinners he wants to
[31:27] take us
[31:28] I mean places are now inheritance that
[31:31] we would know who we are I mean as it
[31:34] says in Ephesians 5 it said he would
[31:36] present himself that's it that's it
[31:39] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[31:41] also loved the church and gave himself
[31:42] word that he might sanctify and cleanse
[31:45] it with the washing by the water by the
[31:47] word that he might present it to himself
[31:49] a glorious church not having spot or
[31:52] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[31:55] should be holy and without blemish a
[31:57] glorious church hallelujah
[32:00] a glorious church not just a bunch of
[32:03] slaves that are still all praise the
[32:05] Lord
[32:06] and Here I am being beaten by some devil
[32:08] and you know I'm just as soon as saved
[32:10] by grace
[32:11] no the shackles are being thrown off I
[32:13] mean the one who was doing the
[32:15] tormenting is under the feet I mean it's
[32:17] been a revolution
[32:19] hallelujah that the rightful is take
[32:22] their position in the kingdom I mean
[32:24] that they're not being beaten down by
[32:25] the devil anymore and
[32:27] and these squatters brother Graham calls
[32:29] the devil a squatter he's squatting on
[32:31] our land hallelujah and he has no right
[32:33] to this place even though he tries to
[32:35] claim it I mean it comes to a point
[32:37] where the people come to recognize that
[32:39] the devil's just a squatter they take
[32:41] their god-given rights hallelujah they
[32:44] stand on their feet they take God at His
[32:46] Word hallelujah and enforcer restoration
[32:49] I was thinking you who should
[32:51] restoration of the pride tree brother
[32:54] Brahim gives a illustration in the
[32:55] beginning of that of that story where I
[32:58] mean I mean of that message where he
[32:59] talks about testimony of a brother who
[33:02] who drove to the tabernacle with his
[33:03] family you know to attend the meeting is
[33:06] a world apart somewhere there track got
[33:08] stolen and and there was a there was a
[33:12] car stealing gang there and there in
[33:15] Jeffersonville in Indiana and they would
[33:17] drive the cars to Indiana or the other
[33:20] the next state over the river whatever
[33:23] it is and they could buy plates and then
[33:24] just put different license plates on the
[33:26] car and say well it was from the state
[33:28] and they were selling them and so so
[33:31] this brother came to brother Graham said
[33:32] my cars being stolen all that closer and
[33:35] there they were they got down and prayed
[33:37] and they prayed that God would restore
[33:39] the car back to the man back to the
[33:43] brother and then Brougham saw a vision
[33:45] of the man who stole it driving it and
[33:47] the Holy Spirit convicted him and then
[33:50] he and then he stopped and he drove to a
[33:52] certain place left the keys there in the
[33:54] car and he left it and brother man said
[33:56] you'll find it in a certain place and
[33:58] they drove there and they found it
[34:00] exactly where he said and so now that
[34:03] was just a restoration of a of a vehicle
[34:07] how much more someone that's walked out
[34:10] of underneath the influence of the Holy
[34:12] Ghost I mean who's still in slavery
[34:14] who's still in darkness I mean brother
[34:17] says we ever right I mean by the law of
[34:19] God to enforce upon Satan our god-given
[34:22] rights that we can send God's agent the
[34:25] Holy Ghost hallelujah and God has to
[34:27] restore it amen and that's more than
[34:30] just now that's more than just a vehicle
[34:32] or something that's been stolen what
[34:34] about a son or daughter of God that's
[34:36] been stolen by the enemy we have a right
[34:38] to enforce amen a restoration
[34:41] hallelujah we do it's time to stand up
[34:46] and take guard his words
[34:47] Alleluia Amen you say well how's that so
[34:51] greater is in you then that devil that
[34:55] maybe in that person a man the Holy
[34:57] Ghost is more powerful that's greater
[34:59] than any enemy that may be afflicting or
[35:02] tormenting hallelujah he can break her
[35:04] yoke he knows how to do it amen
[35:09] now we have to be a glorious church not
[35:13] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[35:16] but it should be holy and without
[35:18] blemish they say well I could never
[35:21] obtain to that now in our humanity we
[35:24] cannot obtain to it but it's like going
[35:27] down into into Goshen where the children
[35:30] of Israel were on the night of the
[35:32] Passover here they are there sitting in
[35:35] there maybe before this they heard the
[35:37] promise we've got a land flowing with
[35:38] milk and honey waiting for us it was it
[35:41] was promised to our father Abraham that
[35:43] is that his descendants would would go
[35:45] and possess the land and you know
[35:47] they've got their aches and their pains
[35:49] and it hurts and their scars and maybe
[35:50] their backs of you know they're pulled
[35:52] some muscles and hurts them yeah it was
[35:54] back-breaking labor and when God said
[35:57] when Moses went down into Egypt the
[35:59] labor got harder amen the devil tried to
[36:03] put more pressure on I'll not let them
[36:05] go now they not only have to make bricks
[36:08] they're going to click their own straw
[36:09] he made it twice as hard for them and so
[36:12] now they wouldn't have just been all
[36:14] limbered up ready for a nice stroll to
[36:15] the promised land they would have had
[36:17] pulled shoulders that would have been
[36:19] maybe pulled muscles and calcified
[36:21] shoulders and oh you're from the labor
[36:23] you know of moving burdens and being
[36:26] beaten and maybe malnourished I don't
[36:28] know but they wouldn't have been in
[36:29] perfect health and some of them were
[36:32] very old when they left when they left
[36:34] Egypt that night and so maybe something
[36:37] beginning to think how am I going to get
[36:38] over to that Promised Land
[36:40] how am I ever going to hear walk over
[36:42] there and all they had to do was not
[36:44] look at the obstacles they need to look
[36:46] at the distance even though they didn't
[36:49] know how far it was they didn't know how
[36:51] they need to worry about all those
[36:52] things all they had to do is to
[36:54] the lamb killed the lamb put the blood
[36:57] on the door lentil eat that lamb and the
[37:00] unleavened bread amen and they receive
[37:02] strength from eating the lamb hallelujah
[37:05] they receive strength from eating that
[37:07] unleavened bread hallelujah and Caleb
[37:10] spent 40 odd years walking out on that
[37:13] strength of that sacrifice because he
[37:16] was 80 odd years old
[37:18] he's standing before Joshua and he says
[37:20] I'm as strong this day as the day I left
[37:23] Egypt now give me this mountain
[37:26] I mean Moses told them in the book of
[37:28] Deuteronomy which was 40 years after
[37:30] they left Egypt your shoes haven't got
[37:32] old your clothes haven't yo got old
[37:35] either hallelujah because they had
[37:38] walked out on a supernatural promise I
[37:41] mean they'd walked out of Egypt on a
[37:43] supernatural promise so they're closed
[37:45] and we're out there shoes didn't wear
[37:47] out I mean they were just as good as the
[37:49] day they put them on hallelujah Caleb
[37:52] was just as strong he was eighty odd
[37:54] years old here was a slave
[37:56] hallelujah a former slave amen that that
[38:01] took the promise of God he received
[38:03] strength for the lamb are you following
[38:06] me
[38:06] this displaced me today I don't believe
[38:09] it was the fumes in the lab Roz working
[38:11] I was genuinely blessed I mean because
[38:13] we can walk we can walk from we can walk
[38:16] from this world to the next world
[38:18] because of the substance of the Lamb I
[38:20] mean because we become one with our
[38:22] sacrifice Holly that he gives us
[38:25] supernatural strength hallelujah amen
[38:30] how are you going to get to that
[38:31] Promised Land just just start eating the
[38:33] lamb I mean just studying the left don't
[38:36] worry about what a you know whatever
[38:37] else is going on take the lamb eat that
[38:40] lamb eat the unleavened bread it'll give
[38:43] you strength hallelujah we've got a
[38:45] seven course you know a seven course
[38:48] menu or whatever you want to call it
[38:49] we're got a full buffet
[38:50] we've got the whole lamb we don't just
[38:53] have a leg or a shank or a cutlet
[38:55] whatever we've got the whole lamb to eat
[39:00] hallelujah we're going to see them and
[39:02] seal menu I mean we've got a full word
[39:05] date hallelujah and Josh
[39:07] I went and he took his Mountain a mint
[39:12] because he walked out of Egypt on the
[39:13] strength of that lamb lujah and it's got
[39:18] to be the same thing with us I mean you
[39:21] really mixed the word with faith you
[39:23] will possess the promise the Bible says
[39:28] and in Matthew it says in Matthew 2
[39:33] fulfilling a scripture I mean a prophecy
[39:36] says when he arose he took the young
[39:39] child this is Joseph taking Jesus and
[39:41] Mary says and he took the young child
[39:43] and his mother by night and departed
[39:44] into Egypt and was there until the death
[39:47] of Herod that it might be fulfilled
[39:48] which is spoken by the lord by the
[39:51] prophet saying out of Egypt have I
[39:52] called my son and if you go back into
[39:55] the Old Testament that does not only
[39:56] speak of Jesus but it was speaking of
[39:58] Israel coming out of Egypt under the
[40:01] Ministry of Moses that was God calling
[40:04] his son out of Egypt I mean so he was
[40:07] calling his son they they weren't slaves
[40:10] to God they were his children they were
[40:12] his son and he was going to take his son
[40:14] and place him in his inheritance in the
[40:16] promised land amen so now Caleb
[40:21] manifested that promise because he
[40:24] wasn't just called out of Egypt but he
[40:25] was placed
[40:26] he took his mountain amen he took his
[40:29] mountain he took his inheritance
[40:31] hallelujah and just sit back and say
[40:33] well if God will give it to me he'll
[40:35] give it to me if not if not a min but he
[40:37] received his inheritance hallelujah is
[40:39] just like I read on your on Sunday from
[40:42] the Song of Solomon the bridegroom is
[40:44] saying to the bride set me as a seal
[40:46] upon my heart and upon thy arm holy is
[40:49] saying let my anointing abide Amen in
[40:53] your heart in your heart and then also
[40:55] let my anointing anoint you what you do
[40:58] but not in your hands
[40:59] Amen anoint your feet and not your eyes
[41:01] anoint your tongue hallelujah
[41:04] I meant that our works would be anointed
[41:07] by God I mean the life that we live
[41:10] would be anointed by God it wouldn't
[41:12] just be our own ability but God would
[41:14] take that ability to anoint it and then
[41:16] to make it live alleluia
[41:21] now the many times we sometimes we can
[41:29] we can think God has just angry at us
[41:32] all the time and we actually must
[41:34] understand the heart of God towards his
[41:37] children this is shown in the and the
[41:40] parable of the prodigal son where the
[41:44] protocol son
[41:45] we know he he said I want my inheritance
[41:47] now and he and he went to a foreign
[41:49] country and he and he spent it all and
[41:51] he wasted it all and then he comes to
[41:54] himself in a pigpen and he and he now
[41:57] says to himself I'm not worthy I'm not
[41:59] worthy to be called my father's son
[42:01] anymore
[42:02] I just go back to his house because his
[42:04] servants are feed better than I am
[42:06] they're in a better condition that I am
[42:07] and then so he thinks because I've done
[42:10] this I'm not worthy to be called the son
[42:12] therefore I'll ask if I can just be one
[42:14] of the servants now this is this is what
[42:16] we think many times because we we always
[42:20] put what we have done and we put it on
[42:23] one side of the scale and then we put on
[42:26] the other side of the scale are we
[42:27] worthy to obtain the promise and we
[42:29] think because we've squandered time and
[42:31] we and we're wasted maybe years or
[42:34] whatever it was they were not worthy
[42:36] they meant to possess the promise that
[42:40] have been placed in the body of Christ
[42:41] as an adopted son
[42:44] Alleluia so he says now I'm not worthy
[42:46] I'm not worthy to be caught my father
[42:48] said anymore I've sinned against heaven
[42:50] and and against him so he says I'm no
[42:52] longer worthy to be called thy son make
[42:55] me as one of our hired servants but this
[42:57] wasn't the father's attitude the father
[42:59] wasn't interested in and turning a
[43:01] sadist into a servant the father was
[43:04] only interested in seeing his son
[43:06] redeemed
[43:07] I mean placed back in his rightful
[43:09] position in the family hallelujah and
[43:11] you can see this in the in the parable
[43:13] where the father commands his servants
[43:15] to bring forth the best robe put it on
[43:18] him and put a ring on his hand and shoes
[43:20] on his feet
[43:21] I mean to restore him with an adoption
[43:24] robe hallelujah
[43:26] friends we've seen an adopted son in
[43:28] this age nothing could stand before his
[43:31] praise if he could get the people to
[43:32] believe him not even cancer
[43:34] every demon had to go I'm in nature had
[43:37] to obey Him
[43:38] this had to give us your death had to
[43:40] give captives back up again hallelujah I
[43:43] mean nothing could stand before that man
[43:47] because he was placed in the body of
[43:49] Christ and now that he was an example to
[43:53] us because God was showing this is what
[43:55] I'm going to do I mean and I'm going to
[43:57] make you like this I mean that
[43:59] everything in your Dominion has to bow
[44:01] to you hallelujah
[44:03] that's why is Binger being a mum I mean
[44:06] in your position in Christ no enemy can
[44:08] stand before you in their position
[44:10] hallelujah being a being a husband as
[44:13] the head of the house Amen if you're
[44:15] standing your position nothing can stand
[44:17] before you amen hallelujah this is not
[44:25] theory this is lived and God's life is
[44:30] here to manifest that amen now brother
[44:36] Brahim says here in the over there he he
[44:46] said that we would overcome and we
[44:49] overcome by our faith this is the
[44:52] victory even our faith the scripture
[44:54] tells us that faith is a revelation of
[44:57] who he is and who we are in him I mean
[45:01] that's how we overcome we know who he is
[45:03] he has revealed himself to us amen and
[45:06] then we know who we are in him amen
[45:10] that's how we overcome because we know
[45:12] that we're just not from from from some
[45:14] culture or some country and I mean but
[45:16] we we begin to understand that we came
[45:18] from heaven as Jesus says I came from
[45:21] God I'm going back to God hallelujah and
[45:24] brother Graham tells us if if we ever
[45:26] had eternal life we always had eternal
[45:29] life because eternal never had a
[45:30] beginning or an end I meant so we always
[45:34] had it you just had to come and
[45:36] recognize it Amen God took the spirit of
[45:38] unbelief out of your life gave you a new
[45:41] nature amen you begin to realize who you
[45:43] really are
[45:45] Alleluia
[45:47] amen now we ever write the call on his
[45:51] name
[45:52] and he wants us to call upon him now
[45:56] it's very different all of us parents
[45:59] here it's very different when you hear
[46:04] another child cry you are you are
[46:06] concerned yeah if you hear another child
[46:09] crying a temp ain't your concern but
[46:11] it's very different when you hear your
[46:13] own child cry and they're in pain
[46:15] there's something that moves very
[46:17] differently in your heart when you hear
[46:19] your own child crying hallelujah now and
[46:23] it's the same thing with God when he is
[46:25] his children cry out to him
[46:28] it moves him in a different way I mean
[46:31] it means a great deal to him when Jesus
[46:33] told the parable of the of the woman and
[46:35] the unjust judge you know he's telling
[46:38] you amen he's more than an unjust judge
[46:40] that just gets weary with someone asking
[46:43] I see and I see you're asking amen
[46:45] that's not how our God operates but he
[46:48] wants you to be like that woman to call
[46:50] upon God day and night hallelujah amen
[46:55] so there's something very different
[46:57] winners winners children call upon him I
[46:59] mean it moves him a very special way
[47:02] amen just like your own children when
[47:05] you hear them and it puts you in
[47:07] direction now we will always need him
[47:12] I'm just kind of maybe jumping around a
[47:15] lot but you know we were created you
[47:17] just take nature everything in nature
[47:20] was made to need something else there's
[47:23] not one thing in nature they mean upon
[47:25] this earth that is yourself existing
[47:27] doesn't need anything amen you take the
[47:31] grass you take all of the bottling life
[47:33] it needs sunshine it needs water and
[47:35] these nutrients you take any of those
[47:39] things away and that plant will not grow
[47:41] like it's mean - it needs though it was
[47:43] created to need those things any part of
[47:46] the food chain needs the other part of
[47:48] the food chain amen every single part of
[47:52] that food chain is vital and it needs
[47:54] the other parts amen
[47:56] you take any of those you cut the food
[47:58] chain and you see nature begin to go
[48:00] the chaos just like it is now with
[48:03] certain species they man may look at and
[48:05] say what roles this have we have no idea
[48:07] it's kind of a useless thing but God put
[48:09] it there because something needed that
[48:12] in the in the in the ecosystem all
[48:15] nature is made to need something else
[48:17] and that's just how much more now when
[48:20] it comes to man I mean human beings were
[48:24] made to need a lujah this is wonderful
[48:28] you know because you got to read about
[48:30] you but but people you know these are
[48:32] saying no man no man is an island
[48:34] that means no man is just all by himself
[48:38] and you know you know and and doesn't
[48:41] need anything we all need something amen
[48:45] and it's just natural we need food we
[48:47] need you know we need shelter we need
[48:49] light we need meat we need those things
[48:52] that's just natural things how much more
[48:55] now now that's just God on a natural
[48:57] level
[48:57] he made us that way funny but he made
[49:01] you that way because he wants you to
[49:03] understand and know you need him I mean
[49:06] that's why we're liking to sheep because
[49:08] sheep need a shepherd they need they
[49:10] need someone to lead them even the head
[49:12] chief doesn't know a whole bunch because
[49:15] they start leading that one and then
[49:16] they start leading this one and then
[49:17] this one's over here and they you know
[49:19] have you ever seen sheep wander around
[49:21] the paddock they just wander but they
[49:25] think they know it looks like an inn one
[49:26] sheep starts walking this way then then
[49:29] you see 500 sheep moving along the
[49:31] hilltop and that one doesn't know where
[49:33] it's going but everyone's following it
[49:35] where God made us like there because he
[49:40] wants us to always always recognize we
[49:43] need him and there'll never be a time
[49:46] when we don't need him I mean there'll
[49:49] never be a time away where we think well
[49:51] we have it all together now I'm adopted
[49:53] son or daughter of God I mean I've got
[49:56] this open word in my hand I know I'm
[49:59] possessing every promise that they
[50:01] everything you know demons under my feet
[50:03] now I don't need them know we'll always
[50:05] need them we'll always need them
[50:09] Alleluia and it's very important we
[50:12] recognize this
[50:14] because he made us that way that we can
[50:17] depend upon him they men and sissies in
[50:22] Hebrews 11 it says and what more shall I
[50:26] say this is the chapter of faith as we
[50:28] know for the time would fail me to tell
[50:30] of gideon america of samson of jitney of
[50:33] david also and samuel of the prophets
[50:35] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[50:37] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[50:39] stopped the mouths of lions quenched the
[50:42] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[50:44] sword out of weakness were made strong
[50:47] waxed valiant in fight turned to flight
[50:50] the armies of the aliens so out of
[50:55] weakness they were made strong but they
[50:57] did great exploits of faith they meant
[51:00] that's the same thing with us we will
[51:02] always need him amen
[51:05] that's why we've got to push it off to
[51:07] one side where we think well maybe one
[51:09] day we'll just have it all together and
[51:11] we'll just be able to run the show
[51:12] ourselves will always need him mm we'll
[51:16] always need him if we man when man tries
[51:19] to take everything into their own hands
[51:20] it always fails
[51:22] amen but if you keep everything in God's
[51:24] hands and it can never fail because he
[51:26] knows how it should go
[51:29] amen so we will always need him it's in
[51:34] order you know brother Graham talks
[51:36] about in the adoption series which is
[51:41] about the tutor raises up the child
[51:43] until the child is ready and and one
[51:46] part of the big criteria with the child
[51:49] being ready as brother and dramatizes
[51:51] with the tutor says to the child okay
[51:52] now we're going to walk up this hill
[51:54] we're going to go this way we're going
[51:55] to go through this some dangerous places
[51:57] and the child says well as long as
[51:59] you've got me by the hand we'll be there
[52:00] it'll be all right I'll follow you
[52:02] I'll leave the tutors the Holy Ghost
[52:05] amen so that's part of now now now the
[52:07] child's really a mean because he because
[52:10] he knows who's leading him he knows
[52:12] who's taking him up hallelujah it's got
[52:15] to be the same thing with us I mean you
[52:17] say well well we're going through some
[52:19] deep water well as long as it leads me
[52:20] through as long as it leads me through
[52:23] I'll be all right
[52:24] I mean well there's a lot of enemies
[52:26] garrison
[52:27] well as long as he leads me through amen
[52:30] he wants to lead me through a victory
[52:31] praise the Lord hallelujah he's got my
[52:34] best interests in mind
[52:37] Amy sees in Christ as mr. God revealed
[52:40] he says but when the current is flowing
[52:41] freely the Word of God it expresses
[52:44] itself the works that I do show you do
[52:47] also in the last days it shall come to
[52:48] pass behold i send you elijah the
[52:50] prophet and he shall turn the hearts of
[52:52] the children back to the faith of the
[52:54] fathers and in there there would be a
[52:56] time come forth when he would express
[52:58] himself when the fullness of his godhead
[53:00] deity through his church have a
[53:03] preeminence as in his church oh my what
[53:05] the anointed man that was jesus the
[53:07] anointed man now the anointed people oh
[53:09] my to bring back the anointed bride and
[53:12] the bridegroom anointed by by accepting
[53:15] he's his why by accepting what eve
[53:17] turned down an adam turning back with
[53:19] the anointing of the word because he
[53:21] said my word is spirit seed he anointed
[53:24] with the word what eve turned down he he
[53:27] comes back and we accepted cease now
[53:30] here comes a time where where where it
[53:33] was in its the anointed man but now the
[53:35] anointed people where that word becomes
[53:38] as anointed becomes flesh in them and
[53:40] they possess every promise hallelujah
[53:44] and we're living in that day I mean
[53:47] where God would take a people lift them
[53:50] up to what they mean to be in him I mean
[53:53] this is why this is more than a church
[53:55] I'm talking about the body of Christ
[53:58] around the world it's more than just
[53:59] having church order and having
[54:01] everything just right in the t's crossed
[54:03] and the I's daughter to the earth it's
[54:05] more than that and having you know it's
[54:07] God manifesting through our people
[54:09] hallelujah it's more than just having
[54:11] nice families it's God manifesting
[54:13] through the family it's God showing this
[54:15] is what this is what the family should
[54:17] be hallelujah everyone in their position
[54:20] one heart one mind one Accord I mean
[54:23] living for one another
[54:24] preferring one another and love how the
[54:27] ouya because remember we need each other
[54:29] I mean as a church party at Anna's honor
[54:32] and and as in a family as well we need
[54:35] one another we were made to meet one
[54:37] another's needs hallelujah that we
[54:41] prefer one another and love I mean where
[54:44] it's more than just more than just
[54:46] you're putting on a good appearance of
[54:48] things but God comes and lives amen
[54:51] because an adopted son or daughter of
[54:53] God amen is now placed in their position
[54:56] in the body
[54:57] amen and God manifests whatever they're
[54:59] called to do God manifests himself
[55:01] through that person hallelujah and
[55:05] that's what we're that's what we've
[55:08] caught ordinance our you say well I've
[55:10] heard this for years and years and years
[55:11] Moses told the children of Israel he
[55:14] says 40 years you've been in this
[55:16] message he saw the miracles in Egypt
[55:19] you saw the Red Sea part you saw God
[55:22] come down on Mount Sinai but yet God has
[55:25] not given you eyes to perceive or ears
[55:27] to hear until this day and they were 40
[55:30] years down the road and here they were
[55:33] they're about to cross over into the
[55:35] promised land the word had just come up
[55:38] and they began to see who they were
[55:40] amen and brother Brahim says when the
[55:44] bride knows what she is in the rapture
[55:46] will go when she knows what she is and
[55:49] she is the word she is the word
[55:51] manifested in this hour they meant she
[55:55] is the Living Word manifested in this
[55:57] hour where God is veil behind skin once
[56:00] again amen you may think well I'm just a
[56:04] little old me God has veil behind skin
[56:06] once again brother Rome says that deity
[56:09] is not just in heaven but Siddhant but
[56:11] it is in you I mean many times people
[56:14] pray about Jesus being up in heaven
[56:15] someplace but he doesn't want to be
[56:17] separated from us he's not just in
[56:19] heaven but that same God is in the
[56:21] believer I mean just like on the day of
[56:24] Pentecost when the pillar of fire came
[56:26] into it when the Holy Ghost came into
[56:28] the Upper Room and man man and God would
[56:31] became United and God came in 12th and a
[56:34] hundred and twenty of his children I
[56:36] mean Jesus wasn't just in heaven Aires
[56:38] and a people I mean because when Paul
[56:41] Paul met met God on the road to Damascus
[56:44] he says who are you lord and the voice
[56:47] of the light says I am Jesus whom their
[56:49] persecutors now Paul wasn't chasing a
[56:52] supernatural being he was taking
[56:54] looking men and woman throwing them into
[56:56] prison amen but because deity was in
[56:59] them that's why Jesus could say you know
[57:03] you other what you're persecuting me
[57:06] amen and so you say well why are you
[57:10] saying all this do you know what power
[57:13] lays with them the believer Jesus said
[57:18] nothing is impossible to them that
[57:20] belief nothing is impossible to them
[57:23] that belief that means there is nothing
[57:25] impossible with you nothing is put as
[57:29] impossible to them that belief I mean
[57:32] all things are possible only belief amen
[57:38] and that's why we need to go beyond just
[57:40] our five senses and go beyond our
[57:42] imagination and go beyond what we think
[57:44] is going to happen
[57:45] take Auditors word discard the five
[57:49] senses discard your imagination and
[57:52] reasoning and affection and conscious
[57:54] and and and memory lay aside those
[57:57] things take God at His Word amen and
[58:00] then all things will become possible
[58:03] amen
[58:05] we're in 2018 we're at the end of all
[58:09] things you know we're gonna start
[58:13] believing for all things being possible
[58:15] I mean when there's particles that have
[58:18] to come home his wayward ones that must
[58:21] come amen if God can if God can bless
[58:25] Abraham enough that he would allow him
[58:27] to go savers nephew amen how much more
[58:31] ain't meant more than just the yo
[58:33] Abraham is a natural man but how much
[58:35] more supernatural Bride of Christ I mean
[58:38] they're more than just a friend of God
[58:40] but they become married to him they
[58:43] meant those his nephew he went and
[58:46] rescued him from the risky them from the
[58:48] armies of the kings hallelujah he
[58:51] interceded for Sodom and Gomorrah but he
[58:53] didn't go down far enough a number amen
[58:57] and now here we are here we are we we
[59:05] have become one with Jesus Christ
[59:07] amen all power jesus's all power in
[59:10] heaven earth has given to me now where
[59:12] is that power now if it if Jesus than
[59:14] you
[59:16] Amen now you just got to give yourself
[59:19] to him and what he wants to do he'll do
[59:21] but we can't just put God in a box and
[59:24] say well I've never seen it done it
[59:25] can't really happen how do I know it
[59:27] could happen well it's just on tape
[59:29] fifty years ago
[59:30] Amen you gotta gotta go beyond that and
[59:32] say if he's the same then he's the same
[59:35] today amen if he can do the same thing
[59:37] back then when people would come up in a
[59:39] prayer line and God would speak to him
[59:42] and say you're not here for yourself
[59:43] you're here from someone you know you're
[59:45] here for someone in there in a mental
[59:46] institution I mean go and find them be
[59:49] well in the name of Jesus Christ and
[59:51] those people win and find them well amen
[59:54] in a sound mind that spirit left them
[59:56] hallelujah and God uses showing us those
[1:00:00] things don't look at what you see and
[1:00:02] and the symptoms and what the devil may
[1:00:04] be trying to do don't look at those
[1:00:06] things take the promise hallelujah I
[1:00:08] think this Easter we need to enforce
[1:00:10] upon Satan I mean by the Holy Spirit our
[1:00:13] god-given rights a man he's a squatter
[1:00:16] kick him off hallelujah and squatters
[1:00:19] normally dwell in a place where well
[1:00:22] he's a natural example so from Papua New
[1:00:25] Guinea when the you know people who earn
[1:00:27] a whole bunch of land like like the
[1:00:30] company my dad worked for they had a
[1:00:31] whole bunch of land but there was a
[1:00:33] volcano eruption and so all the places
[1:00:35] were years ago they had big houses there
[1:00:38] big eruption leveled the place they
[1:00:41] didn't rebuild so just all grass and
[1:00:43] when the grass would grow high enough in
[1:00:45] the squatters would come in because they
[1:00:48] think well they can't see I said here
[1:00:49] we're gonna live in here that build huts
[1:00:51] that have villages all these different
[1:00:52] things and then eventually they you know
[1:00:54] that you know they had to be kicked off
[1:00:56] and that kicked off but then all the
[1:00:58] grass was cut down and the place was
[1:01:00] maintained properly so the squatters
[1:01:02] couldn't come back amen
[1:01:05] and it's the same thing now I'm going to
[1:01:07] bring it into your dish you say well
[1:01:08] that's that's kind of comical but it's
[1:01:10] the same thing with us we get our joy we
[1:01:13] get our peace we have such a glorious
[1:01:15] prayer time a glorious you know time in
[1:01:18] the word
[1:01:19] and we just walk with Him
[1:01:20] but then if we neglect what we're doing
[1:01:23] the grass begins to grow the devil comes
[1:01:26] on the devil begins to come on your
[1:01:29] territory hallelujah
[1:01:31] so it's more than just enforcing them to
[1:01:33] get out you got to cut the grass you
[1:01:35] were to take possession put up some
[1:01:38] fences a man put up some fences get some
[1:01:41] security guards in there hallelujah pay
[1:01:44] them enough that they don't turn on you
[1:01:46] not that the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:01:48] happens over there anyway
[1:01:49] but I'm trying to push show you a point
[1:01:52] you know it takes actually a maintenance
[1:01:54] of a walk it's like a relationship
[1:01:58] you've got to keep working at that
[1:02:00] relationship I mean you just can't say
[1:02:03] well he's wearing my ring I'm wearing
[1:02:05] her I mean you know whichever way she
[1:02:07] she's got my wedding band I gave her and
[1:02:10] I'm wearing hers in you know let's just
[1:02:13] watch the world go by you got to work at
[1:02:15] that relationship I mean you can't just
[1:02:18] take it for granted back and say well
[1:02:20] that's just how it is you know you can't
[1:02:22] let the grass grow amen you say well we
[1:02:27] live in a busy age sure we do but gods
[1:02:30] gives us the power he didn't throw us
[1:02:32] into the sage and say sink or swim see
[1:02:35] how you go he doesn't just he didn't
[1:02:38] throw his bride into the sage just to
[1:02:39] see what's going to happen he's in Judah
[1:02:41] with power I mean he's in Judah with
[1:02:44] with grace to overcome hallelujah he's
[1:02:48] in Judah with the ability to live a holy
[1:02:49] separated life to God and the darkest
[1:02:52] most busy age he's ever been
[1:02:55] Allu you he doesn't say well let's see
[1:02:58] how you go remember the power of God is
[1:03:00] always greater than that of the enemy
[1:03:03] it's always greater who knows about the
[1:03:06] greater than sign the greater than sign
[1:03:11] is the one that is greater than the
[1:03:13] other is always greater there's no
[1:03:15] greater or equals to in God's economy
[1:03:19] amen but we have to we have to pick up
[1:03:22] the sword of the word we're going to put
[1:03:24] on the whole armor of God and if you're
[1:03:27] still entertaining because the devil
[1:03:29] comes along and entices you and if you
[1:03:33] still entertain
[1:03:34] that thought then he's got you in a hole
[1:03:36] I mean if you're still entertaining it
[1:03:40] he's got you in a hole you got to kick
[1:03:43] that thing down you've got a turn and
[1:03:45] reject it completely amen because
[1:03:49] otherwise you still got you in a hole
[1:03:51] amen
[1:03:54] let's take all things we're more than
[1:03:58] able to go take the country as I've said
[1:04:01] before Joshua had the same same whooping
[1:04:05] marks that the other slaves did the
[1:04:07] other spies did but something in them
[1:04:10] said let's go take it
[1:04:11] him and him in heaven Joshua and Caleb
[1:04:13] they had the scars but they didn't let
[1:04:16] the scars of the past hold them back
[1:04:18] from possessing their inheritance I mean
[1:04:21] because they they recognized we weren't
[1:04:23] meant to be slaves that's not what God
[1:04:25] thought of us our God thought of us as
[1:04:28] his children and in our inheritance and
[1:04:31] that's the same thing with us don't look
[1:04:33] at the scars as in our world this is
[1:04:35] what I was or this is what I am rather
[1:04:38] you look at the scars and say I used to
[1:04:41] maybe be this way have made me this
[1:04:44] bitterness or resentment or
[1:04:46] unforgiveness or this whatever it was it
[1:04:48] scared us up but I don't have it anymore
[1:04:50] that's just a reminder I'm free
[1:04:54] hallelujah amen that's you know amen
[1:05:00] you say well I've been down some real
[1:05:03] deep water in some horrible places amen
[1:05:05] just look at those scars and just remind
[1:05:08] yourself you're not in those dark
[1:05:10] horrible deep waters anymore I was lost
[1:05:13] on that in the world the devil just used
[1:05:14] me as a whipping boy well praise God
[1:05:17] you're not that place anymore amen
[1:05:21] oh but it was a terrible horrible time
[1:05:23] praise God you're not there anymore it
[1:05:26] depends of what you look at the scars
[1:05:28] amen
[1:05:30] hey your prisoner to your past are you
[1:05:32] rejoicing that that was your pastor not
[1:05:34] your prisoner and not your future
[1:05:36] hey a men he's called us to an adoption
[1:05:40] this is an adoption age this message is
[1:05:43] an adoption message where the Word of
[1:05:46] God places us in our position and
[1:05:48] that's what this message does hallelujah
[1:05:52] don't worry about the devil you know
[1:05:55] sometimes you got to cast them out
[1:05:57] sometimes you just go to ignore them
[1:05:59] walk on because the devil will come back
[1:06:01] around again you try and fight you in
[1:06:03] the same battle and you say I fought
[1:06:06] this before and you may defeat him again
[1:06:08] he comes around again sometimes you just
[1:06:11] gotta just ignore him and keep walking
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:16] just keep walking anyway amen
[1:06:22] that we would know as we are known I'll
[1:06:27] read this from the token and in and in
[1:06:28] some musicians the musician should come
[1:06:31] he sees when God was first when when God
[1:06:34] made them first man he made him a son
[1:06:36] and the son was so corrupt he listened
[1:06:39] to his wife instead of God and the woman
[1:06:40] listened to the devil instead of her
[1:06:42] husband and when it did it corrupted
[1:06:44] them together that had bought a
[1:06:45] pollution he knew that when they did
[1:06:49] that they miss it they had to bring
[1:06:51] children into the world as his the the
[1:06:55] fruit and the midst of the tree could
[1:06:57] not be touched and when it was they
[1:06:58] brought the sin upon themselves and
[1:07:00] therefore the whole human race was born
[1:07:02] was born wasn't sin there's no way to
[1:07:04] come out and when God and then God came
[1:07:08] down there's only one way to get him
[1:07:11] back that's to get him back a son again
[1:07:13] now how can he do it when his own law
[1:07:17] stood there and he said he's condemned
[1:07:19] then the father himself became one of us
[1:07:23] that's the real lamb that's his purpose
[1:07:25] he had in mind that's the reason the
[1:07:28] lamb was so identified in the Garden of
[1:07:29] Eden knowing that the lamb and dove
[1:07:32] would meet at one time when the lamb and
[1:07:34] of would be together and when he'd known
[1:07:36] through that we can all be together and
[1:07:40] he was willing to make such a sacrifice
[1:07:42] now that the token could be applied that
[1:07:45] we are no more aliens we're no more
[1:07:48] strangers but we're sons and daughters
[1:07:50] of God both Adam and Eve the woman and
[1:07:53] the man joined together our sons and
[1:07:55] daughters of God in Christ Jesus by his
[1:07:58] great sacrifice hallelujah
[1:08:01] you're on their way back as he could
[1:08:02] make them sons and daughters again so he
[1:08:05] became one of us
[1:08:07] in order to do it how Luke where's the
[1:08:09] musicians please I meant out of Egypt I
[1:08:19] have called my son he spoke of Israel he
[1:08:22] spoke of Jesus it's the same thing with
[1:08:25] us out of the world he has called us
[1:08:26] bride hallelujah doesn't that make you
[1:08:30] happy you say well I'm facing a lot of
[1:08:33] giants just take one at a time Amen just
[1:08:36] face one enemy at a time and then when
[1:08:39] you take that part of the land cut the
[1:08:41] grass down put up a wall maintain the
[1:08:43] garden Amen Alleluia how's your prayer
[1:08:48] life doing how's your listening you know
[1:08:51] the devil all of us technology is to get
[1:08:53] this mind on off off the Lord and and on
[1:08:56] other things
[1:08:57] amen I'm gonna say this I downloaded an
[1:09:01] app today to see how much time I spent
[1:09:03] on this thing I'm afraid of how much
[1:09:06] time it is it's a distraction you got to
[1:09:11] know how to manage these things because
[1:09:15] you can spend hours just looking at
[1:09:17] nothing one of the most some of the most
[1:09:21] watched video I'm not saying this as a
[1:09:23] joke some of the most watched videos on
[1:09:25] YouTube err cat videos and humanity is
[1:09:29] watching cats do ridiculous things and
[1:09:31] it's very popular and you may think that
[1:09:34] is crazy that's what people do and we
[1:09:37] use up our time now there's nothing
[1:09:39] wrong with my brother Encino the rules
[1:09:41] you'll hit your hunting fishing whatever
[1:09:43] he did those soon see it closer to God
[1:09:44] and relax I mean so we need something
[1:09:47] that all I'm not comparing hunting and
[1:09:49] fishing while the Prophet did the cat
[1:09:50] videos but you know we made we need time
[1:09:53] to relax right go take some days off go
[1:09:58] to holiday you understand what I'm
[1:10:01] saying I hope this is down in the middle
[1:10:02] but we get so absorbed into stuff and we
[1:10:06] spend hours looking at things and then
[1:10:09] where are we and our mind is full of the
[1:10:11] stuff that doesn't matter and our
[1:10:13] imagination is off on some some
[1:10:15] things that don't and half the news
[1:10:16] that's on the news do we need to know it
[1:10:19] do we really need to know it and yet
[1:10:22] we're but yet it's presented in such a
[1:10:24] way and it's out there in such a way
[1:10:25] that all this is going on that then
[1:10:28] actually helped me in my life no hope I
[1:10:32] made my life a little bit worse did I
[1:10:34] really need to know that no it's where
[1:10:39] the grass begins to grow and squatters
[1:10:42] can come on I mean what he I'm in yeah
[1:10:49] that's standing saying they were able to
[1:10:51] go up and take the country

[1:11:01] they say Lord and Creasy I love for you
[1:11:04] that we I just saw in love for you

[1:11:12] the Lord you love your family amen
[1:11:14] if you really love him you want it to
[1:11:16] pour through you to your family and you
[1:11:18] want to give yourself for them but if
[1:11:20] there's something that's taking up our
