Victorious in Christ. Amen. That's who we are this morning. It's good to be alive. Did you wake up happy to be alive this morning? You can't do much when you're dead. [Music] There's no opportunity to have faith when you're dead. [Music] I go through a lot of stuff, you know, and that that if you when you go through a lot of hard times, you have I have this point that I reach and I think it's not over till it's over. Sometimes you can let some problem overwhelm you in your mind. thinking things, but it's not over till it's over. It ain't over till it's over. So, if it ain't over, then there's hope. And it's not over yet. Like, brother Cadre Diggs preached, to be continued. So, if you ever get in a tight spot and you're letting it all get on top of you, just think it ain't actually over till it's over. You know, and as believers, we'll never be over. Amen. Let's stand this morning. I'm just feeling good this morning. I feel like the Lord's going to bless us in a in a powerful way in our midst. I feel like he's going to move. We're going to have a good song service. We're going to have um an anointed preaching service. So, let's just commit the service to the Lord this morning. Lord, we're so excited to be in your midst this morning, Lord, to be in a place where the spirit of God can come and move and dwell in a powerful way amongst us, Lord. And we just want to commit the service to your hands this morning, Lord Jesus. May you just bless each one that's here, Lord. May you may you fill each one aresh with the Holy Ghost, Lord. May we be may we leave here rejoicing, Lord, and be like those that that were walking with you on the road to Emmas when they said did know our hearts burn within us as he talked with us along the way. Lord, may that be our testimony this morning that may our hearts burn within us this morning, Lord, as we as we bathe in your presence, Lord, and we let the word of God enrich our life, Lord. Lord, and let your spirit just soften our heart, Lord, and warm each heart this morning, no matter how cold it is outside. We thank you that we can be Christians, Lord, and have a Lord, a heart that's warm towards you, and just a heart that's full of joy and full of love, full of peace, full of overcoming power, Lord, full of hope. And we thank you, Lord, that we come to the victorious God this morning, Lord. We read in all of your all of your word, Lord, that any man or woman all throughout the ages that ever trusted in you, they always came out victorious, Lord, and trusted in your word. So, we just want to trust in you this morning. Trust in your word, Lord. We cast out reasoning. We cast out any unbelief this morning. We cast out anything, Lord, that would exalt itself above your word, Lord, above your promises. We cast those things aside this morning. And we we walk in complete faith this morning in you, Lord, as we just continue to walk in the victory. So just commit each one to your hands in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. You can go and greet each other this morning and just just appreciate that you're in the company of winners this morning. Amen.

Great to have Glennice here. God bless you. Welcome. Praise the Lord. So trust you feel at home. Amen. God bless you. Amen. Praise the Lord. You see we've got an extra set of speakers here. We're just trying to balance the sound out in the room. So bear with us. Um it's easier than just plugging in things. So just bear with us with that. Amen. Um yeah. So good to be back from the minister's meetings. Got back last night. So didn't have as much time as I'd like to to prepare. So bear with me if it just kind of a little bit of toss salad or doesn't quite come out right. But you know you love me. E the Lord's good. So so you know let's just um Amen. So let's turn to the scripture this morning. Uh we're going to go to Genesis. Uh, sorry. We're going to go to Galatians chapter 3. Um, yeah, I have the have it here. We're just going to read Genesis. Sorry, don't know why I'm saying Genesis all the time. Uh, Galatians 3:23-29. Amen. It says here, "But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our school master to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after the faith has come, we're no longer under a school master, but we are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as has been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek. There's neither bond nor free. There's neither male nor female. For ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you be Christ, then you are Abraham's seed and is according to the promise. Amen. So, let's bow heads in a word of prayer this morning. If you ever need, you slip slip your hand up, say, "Lord, remember me." Amen. Gracious heavenly father, we're so thankful, Lord, that we can enjoy your love, enjoy your presence, enjoy your word. I just want to ask, Father, that Lord, you just just straighten up all my thinking, Lord. Calm down my spirit. May you have your way in the service today. We come to meet with you today, dear God. So, I pray, Father, all of our hearts would be open that you could come and minister to our needs. We love you so much, Lord. We just pray that you'll take the words we've read and may you anoint it to our hearts and make it live. And dear God, may be with everyone who's streaming. Dear God, may you be their abundant portion too. We commit them into your hands. We thank you for uh the ministers meeting on the weekend. Thank you all safely home. We praise you for that Lord in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you friends. You can have your seats this morning. So I want to speak about I want to speak about headship. Uh but not in a way where it's just a hierarchal thing but there's power in it. there's security, there's um there's stability and it brings out the best actually in those because you know when you when we look at here in Galatians where the apostle Paul we don't really think much of the magnitude of what he's saying here when it comes to where he speaks in verse 28 about how there's neither Jew nor Greek bond or free male or female but we're all one in Christ this was actually a monumental statement that he made because back in those days there was a big demarcation between gentile and non-gentile there was a big demarcation between slave or not, bond or free or male or female. There was a big hierarch you know um different status you know we could see this in the um you know because the Jews they they they were shocked at the very thought of of of the Gentiles obtaining mercy and knowing the Lord and coming under the covenant of God. they, you know, this was a big thing for them to to to realize that, you know, really the bride of Jesus Christ is a gentile bride as shown by Ruth and and and different um you know, shadows through the Old Testament. But and then even even if we um I don't have a diagram, but if we had a diagram of Herod's temple, there was uh different people could approach the Holy of Holies based on who they were. And so there was a court of the Gentiles, and the Gentiles could come to a certain distance, but they couldn't come as far as the Israelites. And then even with the Israelites, there was the court of the woman. So they could approach God with the Holy of Holies closer than the Gentiles ever could, but they couldn't go as far as the men, right? There was the court of the men, Israelite men. Then there was the court of the priests. And then there was the temple itself. So there was even in the how the temple was built. It was based on who you were by your birth is how far you close you could approach God. And and that was the system that was that that evolved. Now we none of us are secondass citizens in Christ. &gt;&gt; None of us doesn't matter what ethnicity we are. Doesn't matter what sex we are. Doesn't matter what age we are. We're all one in Christ. We're all actually on the equal level. Doesn't matter what gift you have. Doesn't matter what part of the body you are. You're part of the body. Right? So this is this is very important when it comes to headship because we realize now that God has because we are joint ears with Christ. Okay? So everything he fell heir to we're joint air with. So we're on equal level with him. &gt;&gt; Right? And this is what the message has come to restore is the church is not a secondass citizen in the kingdom of heaven. We're not servants in the way that we're just paid and we don't know what's going on. No, we're part of the family. And because we are family, he sends his holy ghost into our hearts. We cry aba father. Right? So there's a big So, so the power of the blood has come to restore us back to the original position we're meant to be in, right? And now the enemy has always tried to get us out of the protection of God. Okay? This was his first tactic in the Garden of Eden where you know because before the fall, Eve wasn't called Eve. They were called Adam. They were one, &gt;&gt; right? They two different like God because we know Adam was male and female spirit form, right? Then God formed his body out of the dust of the earth and then put that man male and female into Adam. Okay? And then now when when um but with the animal creation, God did not put male and female say deer in one body then take take out the female deer out of the male, right? He just brought them out of the earth separately. But with man, it was it was male and female spirit, right? Into one body and then God took out the feminine part of Adam and made Eve. But before the fall, they were just called Adam, right? They were joint ears. There was no headship difference. They were co-equal, right? But then, so now the enemy came along and his purpose was to get them from under the protection of the word because basically the serpent was telling telling Eve, "Look, God's holding you back. There's more to this. You can be greater than what you are." and and and this this uh this thought that that that he put into her mind caused the whole fall, right? Because there's always because there's always, you know, people people are trying to restore equality in this day by pushing someone else down. So there's the feminist move wants to push the men down. Then there's now the counterfeminist move of the men wanting to push the woman down. And it but none of that brings people into their ordained position, right? It takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost takes the power of the blood to restore people back to what they're ordained to be. That's the only thing that can bring equality between races, between sexes, between anything. It's when you we come under the blood. That's the only way equality can happen. Right? But if you come under the banner of a church, then you know, you know, if you just have a church relationship with God, then there's no equality in that. Right? There's, you know, systematic religion has always made people secondass citizens. You know, it's maybe maybe the women are second class. They shouldn't be where where they don't talk about the Lord and they just sit and listen or they do washing dishes or whatever. But but we should all be able to have fellowship together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? We're all part of the same body. Is this okay? We shouldn't be afraid of what if sister so and so has got a great deep revelation she wants to share in fellowship. Is that a problem? &gt;&gt; No. That's good, &gt;&gt; right? We're not just you none of us are second class here. &gt;&gt; Some of you looking at me like, "What are you talking about? Can we not all talk about the Lord and his goodness? &gt;&gt; Can we not share what the Lord has put on our hearts? &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter who we are. Little child can come to me and say, "God showed me this. That's awesome. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." Sister, brother, whoever it is, you know. So, but see, because we're all one in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because by by his blood, he has restored us back as joint ears. We're not we're not secondass citizens. You see, we live in a day and hour where God has completely restored us under true headship of his word. &gt;&gt; Okay? So now, what does that do for us? If we're if you know whose authority you're under, it gives you security, &gt;&gt; right? So if I was an ambassador for the United States, right, I could say things and do things that an ambassador from New Zealand could not do &gt;&gt; cuz I have no weight behind me as a Kiwi. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got no weapons. I've got no military force. I've got no trade. You know, I can't be throwing around tariffs. What if our prime minister stood up and said, "Look, I'm going to put all these tariffs on these nations." They'll think that's that's like a Saturday Night Live skit. They'll be laughing about it cuz there's no weight, right? Because the authority he's under or, you know, he is as the prime minister or an ambassador for New Zealand, that carries a different weight to how an ambassador from some superpower would would conduct themselves. So if a if an ambassador for you know so so someone who's under great authority has greater stability they're not afraid of how to conduct themselves they're not arro well they politicians are arrogant but you know but you shouldn't be arrogant about it you should realize no all that this nation so just if I was American all that America is and I'm an ambassador for America all that America is is behind me &gt;&gt; I speak well they have put words in my mouth to speak for them right because we have the same mind Okay. So now if you take that into the spiritual, you're going to realize all that heaven is is behind me, right? I am under I am under the headship of G the Lord Jesus Christ, his word, right? I'm not under the hip of a church &gt;&gt; or a or a man-made system. No, no. We're under the banner of we're under the protection of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so if God is now, if he's taken me under his wings, &gt;&gt; which he has, then I can conduct myself with an assurance that he is on my side and he's protecting me. I don't need to worry and be stressed and be troubled about what the future holds. I know he holds my future. Amen. I know that he's been in my future. I know that he is in control and I can rest in whatever state I'm in right now. I can be content knowing, God, you have my best interest in mind. Lord, you're interested in molding my character to be like your character. Lord, all things are working together for my good. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "Well, you can only say that if you know what the end date of a of a trial is." No, you don't. &gt;&gt; We can stand here with such assurance and confidence because I'm not trying to hold my life together. &gt;&gt; Right? We got to realize, you know, we got to come to a place in our walk we realize, Lord, you're my king, &gt;&gt; right? You're not an errand boy. You're not a lucky rabbit's foot I pull out and rub if times get trouble. No, you're my king and you have not pushed me down into some corner and I'm just some secondass citizen in the back of nowhere and I've got no rights. I've got no ability. I've got nothing. No, you have lifted me up &gt;&gt; to be joint hes with you that I know your heart. I know your mind. Amen. I know your thoughts towards me are the thoughts of peace. They'll come to an expected end. Right? And we know his thoughts can't change. God can't have a new thought. His thoughts are eternal. His thoughts are real. His thoughts do not change based on new information. Right? So his thoughts towards you cannot change based on what you do. Amen. You say, "Well, I've had a bad week." His thoughts don't change towards you. You say, "Well, I've stuffed up big time. I've sinned." His thoughts do not change towards you. Amen. That doesn't mean we're indifferent and just continue on. No, we say, "Lord, forgive me. Wash me in your blood, Lord. Change my heart, Lord. I'm sorry, Lord." But you see, his thoughts towards you cannot change. So if his thoughts towards you, you're my beloved. Amen. You're the apple of my eye. Amen. You're the you're the very purpose of of of of existence right now is my heart is towards you. Amen. I care about what you're going through. I'm mindful. I'm here with you in this trial. If you only knew the gold that is being being being fashioned in your life of my character and you you know see he doesn't he doesn't just he's not indifferent. Remember this is not some indifferent chain of command where we've got to get an interview and you know got to get a time and got to you know maybe see him. No, his ear is always open. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To you and I. This is not some distance thing of, "Well, I'm down here and he's the way up there and how can I ever get an interview with the king?" No, his ear is always open. &gt;&gt; Amen. You You got to realize that, you know, like even brother Brmond asked a question, who's got more authority with God? An archangel who never sinned or or a or a or a sinner who's just given their lives to the Lord's just come under the blood? Not the archangel. It's it's the believer who's become a believer &gt;&gt; because remember whenever we begin to pray to the Lord not yeah I mean he can talk to everyone at once. He never gets overwhelmed you know by he's never that way but you know just just to illustrate it's like you know the angels are talking to him the great throne room of God and there's the archangels and all these things and they're all talking they're having a meeting or whatever more but then now but then now one of us begins to talk to him we're in our brokenness in our desperation we're thinking God do you even hear my prayer and what does he say? Shh. &gt;&gt; Quiet. Angels. My daughter's talking to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. My son's talking to me. Basically saying, angels, they're more important to me than you. And because they're part of me. They're my family. They're my attributes upon the earth. Amen. They're more than just human beings. No, they're part of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so when we begin to talk to him, everything else has got to be quiet. The angels have got to be silent because his focus is on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You ever had someone that's so important in your life that other people are talking, but when they speak, your focus goes on that person &gt;&gt; because you love them. You want more for them. You want to, you know, you want to hear what they've got to say. Your attention is just on them. That's how God times out by a billion infinities and that's how God feels about you, right? So, you got to realize that that that God being God being our king, he's being supreme over us. He hasn't he hasn't pushed us down to some place where basically he says just follow this and you'll be fine. No, it's a it's a love relationship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a relationship of care. And we got to realize if heaven's behind me because like the Bible says Paul would say, "If God be for us, who can who can be against us?" Right? As it says in Isaiah that no weapon formed against me shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Okay? So, so if so, if we have that confidence and and I believe we should, God's for me. He's not against me. He was for me before the foundation of the world when he wrote my name on the Lamb's Book of Life, right? and he can't have a new thought about me. So if he's for me, he's for me. That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He can't change his thinking like, "Oh, I made a mistake by revealing myself to that person." No, he wanted to do it. And he knew our humanity. He knew our frailty. He knew how we're built, right? He gave you your personality for a purpose, right? None of our personalities are disabilities, &gt;&gt; right? He made you a certain way. He wanted you to be how you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. If he didn't want you how you were, he would have changed you. I mean, he would have be no, he would have made you different, &gt;&gt; right? So, if you're quiet, we quiet. If you're loud, you're loud. Extroverted, introverted, flaggmatic, whatever it is, whatever label people have made. Just just be happy to be God made you you, &gt;&gt; right? And he doesn't hold it against you. He's not like, "Why is that person always so quiet? Why can't they be this way?" No, he wants you to be you, &gt;&gt; right? He is He wants you to be you. He made you a certain way that you can be you in Christ the you can only be that way. No one else can be you. No one can take your place how he wants you to be in his body. So because so so you got to see I'm hopefully this is all making sense. But you know if he's our king and this is how he feels towards us. How does it make you feel? It doesn't make me feel like I'm just scraping on thin ice, stepping on thin ice. Doesn't make me feel like am I ever going to get anywhere? No, it gives me a confidence. Lord, you built me for a purpose. You loved me when I can't even love myself. Amen. When I was yet your I was your enemy, Lord, and you died for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was against you, Lord. Everything that I was my first birth actually made me at emity with you. But you bridge the chasm. You didn't even just bridge it. You annihilated it by the blood of Jesus Christ. And now we're joint hes with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? So, you know, we got to I think if we could just look at this as not a it's it's not an impairment. It's not a restriction. It's a liberty. &gt;&gt; I don't have to be conformed to anything of this world. I don't have to put up a facade. I can just be me. &gt;&gt; If I'm doing good, I'm doing good. If I'm struggling, well, I'm struggling. I'm having good day, I'm having a good day. Bad day, that's fine. You know, it doesn't change how he thinks towards you. Cuz what is the expected end? his the expected end that that was spoke about in Jeremiah is that that expected end is will be made in his image redeemed dancing on streets of gold for all eternity. That's your expected end. Remember a trial is not anyone's expected end. You know, it's never the end. It's never like, oh, God just pushes, oh, because you did this, therefore you're going to go through this. Not necessarily. No. God has ordained our footsteps. Amen. He has he is in complete. Remember, he's our king. He's supreme, right? And he doesn't call you to push you around and push you down. &gt;&gt; That is not our God. That is not the God of the Bible that I know. No, he calls us to lift us up &gt;&gt; into heavenly places to be joint ears with him. Amen. That we realize that we're not just we didn't just come in here by accident. None of us are here by chance this morning. But God pre-planned our lives. Amen. That a certain season his word would come across our path. And it's not to push you down and make you feel like you're no hope. But no, it's to lift you up. saying, "Look, you're an overcomer. You don't know what you are, but I'm going to show you what you are." Amen. This is what headship does. It lifts us up to make us realize what we're built to be. And it's not by our humanity, but it's by his supreme grace. Amen. That causes us to realize, "No, we are part of his word." I mean, we're part of him. Like when when Eve was brought before Adam, you know, he said, "You're bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh." He he he couldn't say that about any any other creature in existence cuz he named them all. But when he saw her, he said, "You're part of me." Amen. And that's what the Lord is saying with us now. He's trying to get us to see that we're part of him. &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going on here. Hold on. We're good. I just got unhooked. Okay, we're good. We're good. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. We're good. Maybe I'll just take this off. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you see, this is this is the whole crux of the thing where where where Paul would say, you know, we're all one in Christ. There's no one secondass. It doesn't matter if you're a if if you're been a believer 5 seconds or 50 years. &gt;&gt; You're all the same. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've got to grow into something first, then I've got then you then God will hear my prayers." No way. Amen. Cuz when you were on the other side of the chasm and you called upon his name, he came to you. Amen. Whatever pit you came out of, he reached down his hand. Way for you. Amen. So there's Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. So he says here now even so when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but in the fullness of the time was come God sent forth the son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them which were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons that's the placing of sons and because we are sons God sent has sent forth the spirit into our hearts crying abba father wherefore we're no longer a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen so so we we we we fall heir to everything that he's done. &gt;&gt; Amen. This like I said this probably over a month ago, brother said, you know, I aired it. I didn't deserve nothing, but I aired it all. Amen. Why? Because we are joint ears. You see, like anyone anyone who's truly married, all that they have is their spouses. And the other way around, it's not this is mine, this is yours, and don't touch my stuff. That's not being joint air. &gt;&gt; I mean, it doesn't matter the wealth or lack of whatever, but everything he is, she becomes, &gt;&gt; right? and everything that she is becomes his, right? That because they become one where they're no longer known as a couple, but you always got to say their names together because they're one. &gt;&gt; So when you think of one, you think of the other, right? You think of brother Impo, you think of Sister Sepe. Think of Brother Phil, you think of Sister Belinda. It's just natural. You think because why? They're one, right? You think of Shirley, you think of Christian, you think of me and the other way around. We're irrespon. It's the same thing with us and the Lord. Amen. When you think of him, you should think of your brother and sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they're one, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're fallen air to all things. It's not, you know, because this is what you know, God God has to me to me headship shows that, you know, God doesn't keep back any of his treasures &gt;&gt; cuz all that he is, we're fallen to. &gt;&gt; Amen. All of his power, all of his mercy, all of his forgiveness, amen, all of his grace. Yeah. Every redemptive blessing that he has that he is, we're falling air to. All of his attributes, amen, are ours this morning. Amen. He's not just our father. He's my savior cuz that's part of him. Amen. He's my redeemer cuz that's an attribute of his. Amen. He's my high priest. Amen. Actively interceding on my behalf. Amen. With his own blood. Amen. Standing in the gap between Hallelujah. for me. Why? Because he is my high priest. He is my mediator. Amen. He's my intercessor. He's my guide. Because if I become part of him, I fall an air to all that he is. Amen. He's my provider. Jehovah Gyra. Amen. And he proves these things over and over again. Amen. To show that he's not just given you part of himself, he's given you all of his word, all of his self. Amen. So he's he's my comforter. He's my guide. He's my counselor. Cuz that's all of his attributes, right? He's my king. He's my defender. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's mighty in battle. Amen. He's He's a line of the tribe of Judah. Amen. He's not some weak little hippie kind of guy. No, he's fierce in battle. Amen. He's my shield. He's my buckler. He's my defense. He's my strength giver. Amen. He's my all and all. Everything that he is, I have fallen air to. &gt;&gt; He doesn't just give part of himself. &gt;&gt; If this was just a working relationship, then he'd just be king. or he'd just be father or he'd be I don't know something that's just like a working relationship. He's my husband. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's my all in all. &gt;&gt; He's my sustainer. Amen. There's probably many more that you could, you know, we could think of right now. But you got to see all that he is. We're fallen air, too. Amen. Why? Cuz I've come under the shadow of his great wings. I don't need to try and push someone else down to get something for him or with him. I don't need to push down anyone or anything to get something. Just like the, you know, there's all these kind of movements going on in the world, you know, and then they're going to push down someone else to get what they think is rightfully theirs. That's not Christianity. Let them do what they do. We're full and air to all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Even even where where Peter would be writing here in the um here in the New Testament, he'd be writing to husbands to you know likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto your wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being hes together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered. The Bible in basic English says, "But who has an equal part in the heritage of the grace of life?" Because back then the Jewish people, the woman's testimony held less weight than a man's. And in some courts, they weren't even heard. So they were secondass citizens, right? But he's saying, "No, you're no longer that way. Your joint is together. You have equal part in the heritage of the grace of life." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. To me, that's immensely powerful. Amen. And it doesn't matter who we are. We all have equal part in the heritage of the grace of I just like that we got equal part. I don't have a minor part. It's not like you cut a piece of cake and someone gets a bigger portion, I get a smaller portion. We all get the same portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Now, praise the Lord. If you don't mind, just going to read this here. Who's the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature. For by him are all things created that are in heaven um and that are in earth, visible, invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning of the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. Right? So if he is if so if he is our head and we're his body a living body doesn't have a separated head from a body. &gt;&gt; I've never seen I mean you can actually apparently you can cut off a chicken's head and they can run around and still live somehow. But we ain't some headless chicken &gt;&gt; this morning. We ain't some headless body trying to work out how to be and how to be a Christian and how to live an overcoming life. No, we receive the mind of Christ. A means but where his head is there his body is. Amen. So his So you realize that his head I mean his body is far above all things. &gt;&gt; Remember far above all things. So you know you say well I'm an insignificant part of the body. It doesn't matter if you're the skin on the little toe. You're still on the head of the devil &gt;&gt; right? Your position is still above your enemy right? Not below. Not equal with but you're above. You're on top of him. I mean he belongs under your feet. You say well I'm just a toenail. You're still above him. &gt;&gt; Right? You got to realize this is the position that we have been given. Amen. That it's not. See, it's not God and Satan have not equal power. This is not some wrestling match and somehow God can overcome the He's already conquered hell, death, and the grave. I mean, our head is supreme. Amen. In every way, in every ability. The devil doesn't have the keys to his own house anymore. He's nothing but a bluff. Amen. But you got to realize now. You got to realize that he's nothing but a bluff. Amen. What did the opening of the seals do? Expose Satan. And what is when the first seal opened that that white horse rider went forth and it's a deception riding forth. Right? It's not the King of Kings and Lord of Lords riding forth on a white horse because you read Revelations 19, the symbology there. That's the Lord riding. &gt;&gt; Sharp twitched sword comes out of his mouth. He's called the word of God. He's got many crowns, vesture dipped in the blood of God, right? &gt;&gt; You know, with his own blood. But then in Revelation 6, the first seal, it's just a white horse given a bow, no arrows, and a crown's given to him. They're not the same being, &gt;&gt; right? But when the enemy's exposes that Antichrist spirit riding forth, he's given a bow and no arrows. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine fighting, let's just go back to medieval times. You've got a sword and a shield, you got armor, and a guy runs at you with a bow and no arrows. He says, "I'm going to kill you." You wouldn't be afraid of that guy. He You wouldn't. You say, "You don't have any arrows for your bow, buddy. &gt;&gt; I've got a sword and a shield. I've got the I got the sword of the spirit and the, you know, shield of faith and the helmet of salvation. I got the full armor of God on." And you're coming at me with just a bow. &gt;&gt; But you see, if he can intimidate you, &gt;&gt; then you can think, man, this guy's got something. He can get me with that thing. But he's revealed as a bluff. &gt;&gt; He's revealed as just all talk. &gt;&gt; Amen. He will try and bluff you and intimidate you. think you're never going to get out of this and you're trapped in this mind battle and this is just how your life has to be. He's bluffing you. &gt;&gt; He's bluffing you. He doesn't know the future. &gt;&gt; Our Lord knows the future. Amen. You got to realize that as the seasons change, you know, naturally, so spiritual seasons change. Amen. We, you know, grow up and we go through different seasons of life, we don't forever stay Peter Pans as children, &gt;&gt; right? We don't, our lives are never actually a constant. You know, sure there's some times of life we wish we could go back to. But you got to realize, you know, many people they want to go back to their childhood, but they just had a childlike mind back then. What if you had an adult mind back in that same situation, then you'd realize everything that's going on in your family and everything that's going on in the world. All these things, you think, man, actually, I don't want to go back there. &gt;&gt; But with a childlike thinking, you think, man, that was idyllic and perfect, but you just had limited thinking with that thing. &gt;&gt; And so, we can't ever say, well, I just want my life to be the same. Now, we're always growing. We're always changing. Amen. The season is never the same all the time. Amen. So, you got to realize, well, you say, "I'm going through a winter time and it's hard and it's cold and I'm there's a difficult life and things are going." You got to realize spring is coming. Amen. Spring is coming. Amen. Summer is coming. Amen. There's light, there's temper, there's heat, there's warmth, there's a change of season on its way. We're not always stuck in winter. Praise the Lord. I'm not a snow bunny. I like warmth, you know. But you see, you you got to realize that, you know, but you say, "Well, this seems to be a long season, but it's going to end. &gt;&gt; The season's going to end. The trial's going to end. The trouble's going to end. The questions are going to end. The, you know, the, you know, all the the things you're going through." And the reason we can say that is because our king has shown in nature seasons don't stay the same. &gt;&gt; And we just have to trust him and keep walking through it and the season will change. Yeah, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. And when the season changes, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? That's like like I was talking to Christine this morning. I said, "Look, this accident, your recovery, God could do it like this." &gt;&gt; Right? On my Robin here, the tumor that's gone out of her throat just like that. Different things. God has miraculously healed people, right? But if it doesn't, if it's not that, it'll be a length of time. Well, how long is it going to take? As long as God wants it to, &gt;&gt; right? You say, "Well, what does it matter how long or short?" It's as long as he wants it to, &gt;&gt; right? Because our God said, "I'm I'll never leave you nor forsake you. You go through the waters, go through the fire. You won't drown. You won't be burned. They won't touch you. You will go through all these things. &gt;&gt; And it's however long he wants it to be is how long he wants it to be." And we trust him every step of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he he knows how long he wants it to be. Does it If it's long, does it mean he's more displeased? Anything? No way. It's got nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; But he's ordained a length of time &gt;&gt; and we can just keep walking, keep praising him, keep trusting him. God is in control. The season won't always be this way. Life won't always because the devil, what does he want to do? He wants you to think your head doesn't love you. God, the Lord doesn't love you. He doesn't care. He's not interested. That's why you're going through what you're going through. That ain't true. He does care. &gt;&gt; He does love you. &gt;&gt; Remember, his love is shown by election. &gt;&gt; You know, because even Israel would ask in the book of Malachi, "Lord, how do we know that you love us?" This not verbatim, but you go read it. He says, "Well, he said he said before um Jacob and Esau were born. I loved one and I hated the other one." &gt;&gt; So, his love was shown in election before they did anything, the Apostle Paul picks it up, right? So, his love was shown in election. It's not based on what happens in life, &gt;&gt; right? It's just a grabag of life happens. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't mean that with any indifference or anything, but you know, things happen to us. They just happen to us. &gt;&gt; Well, what's the reason? All things work together for good. &gt;&gt; Amen. God never stands us up with a standup meeting at the start of the day and say, "Look, this is what you're going to go through. This is the time frame. This is what you're going to face." No, we just have to trust him and walk by faith that he is molding us, shaping us. He is dealing in our lives. Amen. He is working everything for our good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because he's the head of the body. &gt;&gt; He's my headship. Amen. I'm under supreme authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has my best interest in mind. Praise the Lord. But you see, it's when we want to do our own thing, that's when danger happens. See, Vashi wanted Vashi was um Vashi was having her own feast and then the king called her and then she said no. Right? She was she was doing her own thing. She refused to come by the king's commandment. But you see, both Esther and Vashi actually had the same benefits. But one wanted to do her own thing. Esther wanted to do the king's thing. If I can say it like that, right? And then even even now the king loved Esther above all the women &gt;&gt; and she obtained grace and favor in his sight. &gt;&gt; Can you put yourself there today? &gt;&gt; You're loved. If that's all you get out of this, you're greatly loved. Amen. You found fa you found you've obtained grace and favor in his sight. Well, is it something I said? Is it something I did? No. You're part of him, &gt;&gt; right? You're an attribute of him. Amen. He He thought of you before the foundation of the world. Amen. His grace and his love is great upon us. Amen. Praise the Lord. And then even it's amazing, you know, when the, you know, when Esther comes in before the king, he says, "What will thou queen Esther? What is thy request?" And you know he asked this question multiple times. What is your request? It shall be given thee to half of the kingdom. And that doesn't mean he's going to split the kingdom. It means every half of the kingdom. You're joint air with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so, so the king's always asking Esther, what is your need? What is your request? You got to realize who you are, Esther. I mean, you're not you're not just a queen. You're not just part of the household. No, he loved her above all the women. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so she's always, you know, you know, he's asking her, "What is your request?" Or, "Can I ask things?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey, if God's on your side, you should have big plans. &gt;&gt; Amen. You We receive not because we ask not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are. And you know, and we receive not because we ask a miss. Well, how do you know if you're asking a miss? Well, how do you know you're asking right? It's got to be according to his word, &gt;&gt; right? But you see now she she was given this you know it'll be given up to the half the kingdom and then because she was joint ears with with the king now she was afraid to go in before the king. I haven't been invited 30 days was her reply to Mori when Mori was pleading with her. You must go and intercede for our people cuz Hmon's had this law written and you know she was but she was like listen I've been invited for 30 days and it's death to go into the prince of the king. She forgot that she had obtained grace and favor &gt;&gt; in his sight. &gt;&gt; So she was actually the one that he would have wanted in the in the throne room. &gt;&gt; Right now here's you now, right? This is this is how our Lord thinks about you. But you see, so she was afraid to go into the presence of the very one that loved her. She had the wrong understanding of headship. Would he listen to me? I'm not welcome. I've been invited. We're called to go boldly before his throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have been, I believe, awakened to the fact that we can boldly go before his throne. We have a right to call upon heaven. Amen. We have a right to call upon our king in any time. Amen. You know, like Jesus would tell the parable of the unjust judge. It was that widow woman and you know, basically that woman just kept bugging that judge until eventually the judge gave in and said, "Well, I'm just going to fix this case because she's wearing me out." Now, our God is not an unjust judge. You know, he doesn't he's not afraid of us wearing him out, but he's just basically saying, "Go and ask. Him that seeketh findeth. &gt;&gt; Him that knockketh. Knocketh." Not just knock, knockketh. It'll be opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this this is what, you know, he's trying to get us to see. Look, don't just go one time, get an answer. Him that seeketh findeth. He doesn't get weary with you asking him. He wants you to come to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I just want to I just want to um I won't be too much longer. As I said, I haven't um it's the same thing. It's the same thing with Ruth because if we if we realize whose headship we come under, then we realize that we can there's power within that that redemption can come to our loved ones. Okay. So Ruth Ruth would be instructed by Naomi to go to where Boaz is laying there on the you know the barley harvest and he's asleep there and go go to his feet laid down and then he will tell you what he's going to do you know you know what's going to transpire now Naomi lost property in Israel right she that property and Naomi that needed to be a restoration &gt;&gt; and the only way that restoration could come is by Ruth coming under headship of Boaz being united with Boaz All right. And so now Boaz being a type of Christ. Ruth being a type of the bride is that Ruth did not become a secondass citizen in Boaz's household, she became Mrs. Boaz, &gt;&gt; right? So everything that he had, she fell he too, right? After they got married, she didn't go back and um was gleaning in the field anymore buying the reapers &gt;&gt; because she owned the field. Right? Those reapers weren't actually her leadership now. They were working for her, right? because she wasn't gleaning in the field trying to survive. Imagine if the day after the wedding or the honeymoon she she goes back, you know, she goes back out to the field and starts gleaning again. Those servants would think she does not understand who she is and how much and sadly how many times we just say, "Well, I'm just surviving and I'm just scraping through and, you know, trying to find a little blessing here, blessing there." When we realize every redemptive blessing is ours, &gt;&gt; right? That we don't need to just just just survive. No, we're overcomers. &gt;&gt; All this, every divine promise of God by the blood of Jesus Christ is yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, so she came under, she came under his headship. And then what happened? Naomi's land was restored. Naomi was redeemed. And then, of course, Ruth was no longer a Moabitis, but she became Mrs. Boaz. Amen. Because in the law, remember, a Moabitete could not come into the congregation of Israel. But grace always overshadows the law and it brings a restoration and redemption. Amen. So you think, well, legally, I've I've I've I've ruined my chances with God. I've done too much wrong. I've broken every commandment. No, but that's when grace steps in. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's always room for restoration and redemption. Amen. Why? Cuz grace overshadows the law. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brings redemption. To me, this is this is this is my king. &gt;&gt; This is the headship of commander. Amen. There's I can't fall too far, go too wrong, be in sin too long for him not to find me and bring me back &gt;&gt; to where I was ordained to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So now Jesus made this statement. He says, "Then Jesus uh uh then said Jesus to the Jews which believed on him, if you continue in my word, then you are my disciples indeed, and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." Amen. So the truth has a power in it to free us. Amen. So now if we realize now that God is our head, God's our king, that we're his bride. Amen. We're not a servant. We're not just struggling along. We're not maybe we're not a church member. There's no church members here, right? But we are sons and daughters of the most high God. And the devil's under our feet. That should free us from his lie. Free us from his grip. I mean, because the devil wants you to think, like I said, boy, he's nothing but a bluff. But if you believe him, it gives him power in your life. So you give him as much power as you let him have. &gt;&gt; Right? So if you have in your mind, there's no way I can be saved. I'm lost. I've crossed the crossed the line between mercy and judgment and I'm just wrong and there's no way back for me. You know, you've given him power, right? But then if you do the opposite now and say, "No, I'm a son or daughter of God. Satan, get behind me in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. My Lord has given me complete authority over your works and you devil. Get behind me in Jesus Christ's name. This is This is not my portion. Amen. Anxiety is not my portion. Amen. Fear and depression, that's not my inheritance. Satan, get out in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Satan, you can't tell me these things that I can never overcome. I can never be well. You're lying to me. You are disabling his power. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. Now, the truth is more than a collection of nice ideas. It's more than just a good argument. No, the truth is a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. The truth is the Lord Jesus Christ. So you continue in his word and you shall know me and I will make you free. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he is the way, the truth, and the life. Amen. And there's nothing that can stop our God doing what he wants to do. Why? Cuz our head is supreme. Hallelujah. I trust you've got a lot of confidence in your king. Amen. In your husband, your bridegroom. Amen. Praise the Lord. But you see the devil wants us to think that we are just a bunch of servants of someone else. This is Goliath. He would he would he would be telling the children of Israel because he's, you know, sending out the challenge, bring me a man. Bring me a man to fight me. Let's not all die. Just, you know, you pick your champion and I'm I'm the champion here. Come and fight. And he says, he says, why you why are you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine and ye servants of Saul? See, the problem is Saul wasn't under the headship of the word anymore. He was under his own headship because he compromised because of fear of man. He was doing his own thing. So he wasn't under the shadow of mighty Jehovah's wings anymore. He wasn't under the headship of the word. He was under his own headship. So when he came under his own headship, then his army became his servants. But then David who was under the headship of the word because remember Samuel anointed him. See the spirit of God was with him from that day on. That means he came under a different headship. He came under the headship of Almighty God. So now when he came into the battle, David said, "And who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?" Amen. So So he didn't even say, see, he says he's uncircumcised. Cuz someone who's under headship can recognize someone who is I mean something who is not, &gt;&gt; right? Because if you're under headship, you've you've come in covenant with God, right? You're one with him. Amen. So he's telling the, you know, the you the Philistines, they have no promise with God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, it wasn't the God of Israel and the God of the Philistines had some kind of wrestling power match going on. No, the Israelites were under almighty Jehovah God who made everything. &gt;&gt; And the Philistines were just serving some dead fish god, just an idol. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know and you it was even shown when uh you know well I think it was before this you know when the you know when the ark was taken and all these things happened you know and then they brought the you know the Philistines brought the ark into the temple of Deeon. Then what happened? They came out the next morning and they found that statue of Deeon on its face &gt;&gt; head broken off arms you know hands cut off. Why? Because everything has to bow &gt;&gt; to that headship. Everything must bow to supreme authority. Amen. So now when and it's the same thing now when the spirit of Deaeon was was was tabernacled you could say or anointing Goliath and God almighty God was anointing David what happened when David threw that stone at him he he didn't fall down backwards he fell down on his face. Amen. Showing that the same authority that God had over Deeon was the same one when that spirit comes into a man. God still has supreme authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. And why so so David David knew actually no why is he defying the armies of the living God. See David because he was under headship realized actually brethren we are an extension of God. We're his armies upon the earth. Amen. We're not servants of Saul. We're not working serving some man-made kingdom. No we are we are the armies of almighty God. We are his earthly strength upon the earth. Amen. Where God can live. God can manifest himself. It's the same thing with you and I friends. We got to realize we're not servants of Shikina Tabernacle. We're not servants of me, God forbid, or anything like that. No, we are the armies of the living God. We're the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Where God can manifest his word through to this dying world. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Amen. If you realize you're under when you're under that headship, &gt;&gt; Satan get watch out. You're in trouble. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. If God be for us, who can be against us? Why? Cuz he is my shield and my king. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we know that, you know, it was it was God that gave David the victory against Goliath. It wasn't David's ability. It was God's ability. When you come under the headship of the word, you realize it's not my physical ability that gives victory. No, you're just there and God does it. &gt;&gt; Cuz what is really a testimony? You're just giving evidence. I was there when God showed up and did something. &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't free yourself. You didn't save yourself. God saved you. So when you testify of God's saving grace, you're just testifying of what he has done in your life. and we get healed or delivered or God does something. You're testifying of what he did when he showed up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Because we have really have nothing to boast in our own ability or anything. No, it's all him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Brother says in the Patmos vision, he says, "Don't fear John. Don't fear little flock. All that I am your heir to. All my power is yours. My omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst." Amen. And I've not come to bring fear and failure, but love, courage, and ability. All power is given unto me, and it is yours to use. You speak the word, I'll perform it. That's my covenant, and it can never fail. Amen. Why? Because when you begin to speak the word, it is not you mentally saying something. It's God speaking. Amen. Have you ever come to a place when you're praying and you no longer praying, it's God praying. Amen. God, the inspiration strikes you. What is that? That is God speaking his word through you. Amen. And when you begin to address your enemy, it's not your, oh, what can I say? What can I do? But you realize God is that's your headship taking over your life. Amen. That's God stepping in into your battle. Amen. Why? And that's what happens when you speak that word, I'll perform it. It's not us trying to conjure something up. It's not mind over matter. No, it's God's revelation of his word anchored into our hearts. It speaks forth. Amen. And brings to and and then God brings to pass what you ask for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember our God ain't some silent CEO somewhere in some head office. No, he's with us even in us to the end of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what this message has come to do. To restore a true spiritual relationship between God and man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What? That we're joint ears. Amen. He say in the book of Malachi, "Behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud day, all that do wickedly shall be stubble. The day that cometh shall burn them up, say the Lord of hosts, it shall leave neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name. And that word fear means a reverential trust. &gt;&gt; There's an all. When we speak the name of Jesus, it it ain't a curse word. It ain't just say it isn't just a name. There's an all that comes into our hearts. Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. You're the Lord God Almighty who made all things redeeming on you that day on Calvary. You are the supreme one. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that shows you've got fear for his name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says that they that fear my name. Shall the son of righteousness arise. Hallelujah. With healing in his wings. Amen. There's not condemnation in his wings. Is not judgment. No, there's healing in his wings. Amen. That has arisen. Amen. A new season is dawning. I tell you what, friends, we're not staying in the same season forever. So, I'm trying to get this across to you. Whatever you're going through now is not forever. It's not eternal. It's not fixed. Amen. You will come out of it stronger and better than ever before. Amen. Why? Because the sun is rising. Hallelujah. Amen. He's risen with healing in his wings. Amen. Was that healing of our bodies? Healing of our spirits. Amen. Healing of our hearts. Amen. What did he say when he stood there in the synagogue, I think in Nazareth, and he opened the book of Isaiah? He says, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me to bind out the brokenhearted." Said, "At liberty, them that are bruised." Amen. To restore sight to the blind. Amen. What is that? This people have been broken would be healed. Amen. Hearts that have been smashed would be brought back together. Amen. where where spiritual eyes have become blinded because of pain or man's systems. Amen. That that the sight would be restored. Amen. Those that are in prison, amen, complexes, pains, those chains would be broken. Amen. That we'll be set at liberty because we are the bride of Jesus Christ by his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he has arisen with healing in his wings. Not with judgment or condemnation or well I told you so and all those kind of things pushing you down. No, he wants to lift us up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has arisen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to finish with this one scripture. Maybe the musicians could come. I just want to finish it here cuz I I just feel this is a good place to stop. You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; You are the apple of his eye. &gt;&gt; You are his beloved. Amen. You are the very purpose of his being right now is you. You say little old me on this back side of the Pacific. Absolutely. He cares for you more than you realize. Amen. He's not some distant head that just says, "Just be in your place, woman." God ain't interested in that kind of a deal. He wants to reveal himself. He wants you to know him. He wants you to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what and to me, what does it do? It gives me such a security, &gt;&gt; such a stability, such a peace. Well, how can you have peace? Somehow I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Gives me such a joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm on my way to heaven shouting victory. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is supreme over my life and he's supreme over all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we don't have to worry. Let's just actually let's just go to um uh no, let's just read this. He says that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. So if you really love yourself, brothers, that love is shown by you love your wife. Okay? For no man ever hateth his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, of his bones. &gt;&gt; We're power of his power, spirit of his spirit, life of his life. Amen. As brother says, she is him. Our identity is is in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what can we say to these things? I say, Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I'm under your banner. I'm not I'm not under the protection of a church or some hierarchy of man or even some religion. I'm under the protection of almighty God that he is my king. He is my head. Amen. I get my orders from him. Amen. It's not do this, do that like a servant. It's like honey, I love you. &gt;&gt; I want to spend the rest of this life with you. Then I'm going to take you into eternity. We're going to enjoy eternity together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not some squash downcast thing. That's what the devil's tried to put in our put in our minds. No, we're the apple of his eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. He loves us with an unfailing love. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's stand this morning. Let's sing that song. Oh love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong. Amen. I love that. Well, I love that whole song, but that last verse, what's the whole purpose of it? Drawing out my heart to thee. Amen. So, it's not a goal for a separation or anything. No, we join ears together. Amen. So, let's sing this, shall we? Amen. The love of God is greater than tongue open can ever tell. It goes beyond the highest s and reaches to the lowest hell.
