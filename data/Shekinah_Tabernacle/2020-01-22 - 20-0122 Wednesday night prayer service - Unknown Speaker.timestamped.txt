[32:44] with him all things are possible I mean
[32:48] let's go to 1st Samuel 17 well familiar
[32:50] piece of scripture just having some
[32:53] fellowship with brother mouth and he
[32:54] just relates something that brother Doug
[32:57] Baker said and I just stood something so
[33:01] it's amazing someone comes the other
[33:03] side of the world you get blessed they
[33:04] go on their way
[33:05] anyway first Samuel 17 and we're gonna
[33:08] read from verse 42 and when the
[33:12] Philistine
[33:13] this is David and and Goliath as we know
[33:16] and when the Philistine looked about and
[33:18] saw David he disdained him for he was
[33:21] but a youth and ruddy and of a fair
[33:24] countenance member he had been saying
[33:25] bring me a man for forty days and God
[33:28] supplies to the man I mean and the
[33:30] Philistine said unto David to my dog
[33:32] that I cometh to me with staves and the
[33:34] Philistine cursed David by his gods and
[33:37] the Philistine said to David come to me
[33:40] and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls
[33:42] of the air into the beasts of the field
[33:43] B&C David to the Philistine doubt comes
[33:46] to me with a sword and with a spear and
[33:47] with a shield but I come to thee in the
[33:49] name of the Lord Lord of hosts the god
[33:52] of the armies of Israel whom now defied
[33:55] this day will the Lord deliver me into
[33:57] thine hand and I will smite thee and
[33:59] will take thine head from the you know
[34:02] give the carcasses of the host of the
[34:04] Philistines the stand to the fowls of
[34:06] the air and to the wild beasts of the
[34:07] earth that all the Earth may know that
[34:09] there is a God in Israel and all this
[34:12] what a prophecy he just said and all
[34:14] this assembly shall know that the Lord
[34:16] save Earth not with sword and spear but
[34:18] the battle is the Lord's and He will
[34:20] give you into our hands and it came to
[34:22] pass when the Philistine arose he came
[34:25] and drew nigh to meet David that David
[34:27] hastened and ran toward the army to meet
[34:30] the Philistine and David put his hand in
[34:33] his bag and took hints of stone and
[34:34] slang it and smote the Philistine in his
[34:36] forehead that the stones sank into his
[34:39] forehead forehead and he fell upon his
[34:42] face to the earth so David prevailed
[34:45] over the Philistine with a sling and
[34:46] with a stone and smote the Philistine
[34:48] and slew him but there was no sword in
[34:51] the hand of David therefore David ran
[34:53] and stood upon the Philistine and took
[34:55] his sword and drew it out of his sheath
[34:56] thereof and slew him cut off his head
[34:59] their worth and when the Philistines saw
[35:01] their champion was dead they fled and
[35:04] the men of Israel and of Judah arose and
[35:06] shouted and press and and pursued the
[35:08] Philistines until they came to the
[35:10] valley to the gates of Ekron and the
[35:12] wounded of the Philistines fell by the
[35:14] way to share him even unto death and
[35:18] unto Ekrem amen let's bow heads in a
[35:21] word of Prayer gracious Lord Jesus we
[35:24] just asking dear God in this moment that
[35:26] you would come among us in a very real
[35:28] way Lord we want to thank you you're a
[35:30] supernatural God and Lord and as your
[35:32] prophet told us in your presence the
[35:35] supernatural is happening well we know
[35:37] that's more than a nice quote it's a
[35:38] reality so far though just Lord we just
[35:40] invite you into this little room tonight
[35:42] father may you anoint every heart dear
[35:45] god father anoint your word to every
[35:47] soul Lord I pray faith would rise in
[35:49] every heart dear God just father you
[35:51] know the battles we face law the
[35:53] challenges Lord that we may be meeting
[35:55] even now or tomorrow and I just asked
[35:57] Lord may you step on the scene Lord like
[35:59] never before I want to thank you Lord
[36:01] that truly is there's a man standing
[36:03] prison they can turn on the light Lord
[36:05] which is you O God father I pray you
[36:07] turn the light on every life Lord may
[36:09] bless this little thought now I pray
[36:11] father and just have your way in this
[36:12] prayer meeting for your glory in Jesus
[36:14] Christ's name
[36:15] amen amen god bless your friends you may
[36:18] have your seats must have been a very
[36:20] interesting kind of a contest there you
[36:23] know we we see Goliath here's a champion
[36:27] so know he had fought many battles even
[36:29] Saul would would would tell tell David
[36:32] win when David would begin to testify to
[36:34] Saul how he killed the lion and killed
[36:36] the bear and he'll kill this you know
[36:38] Goliath the same as he killed the lion
[36:39] and killed the bear and you know and and
[36:42] and Saul being a natural man or I'd say
[36:44] being a man under judgment he would say
[36:46] to David but you're a youth and this man
[36:48] has been a warrior from his youth so no
[36:51] doubt Goliath had fought many battles
[36:52] and no doubt Goliath kind of was working
[36:54] out in his mind how this thing would
[36:56] work out you know who the Oh someone
[36:58] would come out simile armed to him with
[37:00] the same kind of weapons and he would he
[37:02] would face him in a certain kind of way
[37:03] and maybe Goliath had some tricks up his
[37:05] sleeve and you had to use this height
[37:07] maybe his weight as strength to his
[37:09] advantage and maybe you know it's like
[37:11] you know like a any kind of duel that's
[37:13] like a chess match where you've got your
[37:15] yo secret Yoshio your your secret
[37:18] finishing move saved up you know your up
[37:21] your sleeve so to speak and you try and
[37:22] you know work your enemy into a corner
[37:25] then you give the killing blow and no
[37:27] doubt Goliath had this in his mind how
[37:30] he's gonna face him maybe he thought
[37:31] he's gonna fight Saul because he was
[37:33] hidden shoulders above the rest but when
[37:35] the devil when the devil made the
[37:37] challenge God said I'll meet your
[37:38] challenge and I'll give you one that can
[37:41] defeat you so here was David now and and
[37:44] and we read in the scripture that when
[37:46] David drew near to the Philistine that
[37:48] the Philistine disdained him because
[37:50] here was an opponent that Goliath did
[37:52] not expect he did not expect the
[37:55] shepherd boy out of all the hosts of
[37:57] Israel with their shields of their
[37:59] spears and their armor and their muscles
[38:01] and all these things maybe he was
[38:03] thinking maybe you know maybe in his
[38:04] mind he member for forty days he he
[38:06] would go out morning and night bring me
[38:07] a man bring me a champion bring me
[38:10] someone to fight me and no doubt when he
[38:12] would look at the armies of Israel up
[38:14] there on the hill maybe you begin to
[38:15] think maybe they'll see in that one well
[38:17] maybe they'll send that one he'll begin
[38:18] to size up as enemy or the devil sizes
[38:20] you up you know the devil sizes you up
[38:23] and he's got plans how he's going to
[38:24] kill you but you
[38:26] here here was he was God's answer to the
[38:29] devil's challenged and he came David out
[38:32] and and it said that the the Philistine
[38:34] disdained David because now the the
[38:38] pride of the Philistine you know he was
[38:41] being insulted and my dog you come to
[38:44] chase with staves as this is this what
[38:46] you think I am I'm Goliath I'm a
[38:48] champion
[38:49] I'm the champion of the full-size I'm a
[38:50] giant look how big I am
[38:52] yeah the devil makes himself so big he
[38:54] can't miss him hallelujah
[38:57] so here he was but now what happens now
[38:59] if we just take the natural world and
[39:01] brother it if you've got that video soon
[39:04] not now but soon you know in the natural
[39:07] world if you go into you know you know
[39:10] if you go into the wild with these
[39:11] predators predators generally know how
[39:14] the prey will act so when it comes to if
[39:17] you're a prey item the predator expects
[39:20] you to run but if you do not behave like
[39:23] a prey item then the predator will stop
[39:25] and they hold on this is a different
[39:27] kind of animal so it's that's with
[39:29] anything you said you go to Africa you
[39:31] run from anything it will chase you it
[39:33] will kill you but if you stand your
[39:34] ground and you behave differently to the
[39:37] animals because remember a human has a
[39:39] different thinking say to a zebra or to
[39:42] an Impala or any kind of prey item in
[39:44] Africa we think different but if we
[39:46] think the same way as the animals will
[39:48] be eaten like the animals right that's
[39:50] the same thing now we are built the
[39:53] believers we do not act like normal
[39:55] human beings we do not act member
[39:58] remember this this battle we're in is
[40:00] not against flesh and blood as against
[40:02] spiritual wickedness demon powers and
[40:04] high places even right now the devil you
[40:06] are no doubt putting thoughts in your
[40:08] mind distracting you thinking about
[40:10] everything else but what God may be
[40:11] saying I mean but we must recognize that
[40:14] we do not act like normal human beings
[40:16] so in the enemy come singing us with a
[40:19] mind battle or some ought against
[40:20] someone or unforgiveness whatever it
[40:22] might be the believer responds
[40:24] differently to the carnal man
[40:27] hallelujah so now that's the same way if
[40:29] we were in Africa right now and there
[40:31] was a pride of lions around us I mean we
[40:34] would or should act differently than a
[40:36] zebra but some zebras are built a little
[40:40] bit different now just hold on for a
[40:41] second
[40:42] you know so if we it's like we were told
[40:45] your brother Gideon and so we're telling
[40:47] us never got like an elephant if you run
[40:49] from an elephant it will kill you but if
[40:52] you stand your ground it doesn't know
[40:54] what's going on and they showed us a
[40:57] video and maybe I'll save it for another
[40:59] day we'll find it first but they were
[41:01] with this guide who knew an elephant
[41:04] behavior very well and and the elephant
[41:07] and came literally right where the wall
[41:10] is where I am the elephant came right
[41:13] there this big bull elephant and how how
[41:17] it faked charged them up and did
[41:18] everything the the the guide said okay
[41:20] an elephant has to stand by something
[41:23] funny a an elephant X has to stand by
[41:26] something so even if it's a little bush
[41:28] or a tree it will fake charge to
[41:29] something and it will fake charge to
[41:31] something else and then it'll try to
[41:33] make another bluff if you run you're
[41:35] dead but if you stand still at one
[41:38] Stampede you kill you so there was a
[41:41] bush and a couple of trees and then the
[41:43] guide said okay he'll he'll fake charge
[41:45] to the street to this bush to this bushy
[41:46] and he's going to stop right there now
[41:50] you'd feel a lot like thankfully we saw
[41:52] them from afar we're in a vehicle it was
[41:54] they you know but that would be scary
[41:56] this big thing intimidating you're the
[41:57] devil wants to put his fear upon you and
[41:59] if he can get you to fear him he's
[42:02] disarmed you but if you tell him you
[42:04] tell him to take that fear and take it
[42:06] away in the name of Jesus Christ I mean
[42:08] he has no power if you remember the
[42:10] first house we ever lived in here and
[42:12] here in Wellington down down frickle
[42:15] Tennille is a demon spirit in that place
[42:18] because the previous tenant use it as a
[42:20] brothel and spirits go into buildings by
[42:23] the act that's done in the building oh
[42:25] my hallelujah think about the spirit in
[42:28] this place where God comes down and we
[42:30] worship women we praise him hallelujah
[42:32] the spirit in this place should be
[42:33] different to somewhere else in the world
[42:35] and so there was that spirit in there we
[42:37] we move and we started fighting we never
[42:40] normally fight
[42:41] I would go to work it would be like some
[42:42] big oppression spirit with leaf I came
[42:45] back home as soon as I saw the house I'd
[42:47] feel the suppression come upon me
[42:48] Christine saw a dark streak running
[42:50] around in the place and we realized we
[42:52] had to pray we realized it was more than
[42:54] just us in the place now the previous
[42:56] tenants maybe you know they just came
[42:59] under the influence that spirit and that
[43:00] spirit just ran right in their lives but
[43:02] the believer is different hallelujah
[43:06] so we knew we had god-given Authority we
[43:08] can cast the spirit out I mean in God
[43:11] not because we did any but God's
[43:13] sovereign grace he came down and he
[43:16] drove the thing up but when we were
[43:17] praying against it you know a real fear
[43:20] came on me I said Satan how dare you put
[43:22] your fear upon me in the name of Jesus
[43:25] Christ anyway cut a long story short
[43:27] that spirit was cast out of such a
[43:30] peaceful atmosphere in the house
[43:31] Christine even brought someone into our
[43:33] house it wasn't even a believer she came
[43:35] in and said it's so peaceful in here
[43:38] before that it wasn't peaceful but why
[43:40] remember the believer behaves
[43:42] differently to the carnal man right
[43:46] because we are different because God has
[43:48] made us different hallelujah
[43:51] so now so they say if you run from an
[43:55] elephant it'll kill you but if you stand
[43:57] your ground just like a leopard just
[43:59] like a lion if you run it will kill you
[44:02] because it will chase you because it's
[44:04] used to things running from it the devil
[44:06] is used to people fearing him and and
[44:09] just caring and saying oh if you just
[44:11] leave me alone a little bit I'll do what
[44:12] you want just give me a little bit peace
[44:14] oh no we are not called we are not
[44:18] peacekeepers brother Duane fear see that
[44:20] that Easter can be seen a few years ago
[44:22] in Auckland we are not peacekeepers with
[44:23] the devil we're here for victory total
[44:27] absolute complete victory I mean we're
[44:30] the devil you know what an unconditional
[44:32] surrender means the other side just
[44:35] gives up and the victor puts their terms
[44:37] on the on the defeated ones I mean it's
[44:40] like us this is not a conditional
[44:42] surrender devil I'll give you Monday's
[44:44] if you give me Sunday or you know yo you
[44:46] can have a part of my life if I get most
[44:48] of it no that's not how this works
[44:49] all or nothing I'm gonna take all
[44:53] hallelujah so if we behave we are not
[44:56] cool to behave like other people in the
[44:58] world who know not God everything that
[45:01] comes against us we're gonna behave
[45:03] according to the word that's why Jesus
[45:05] said someone smite you turn the other
[45:07] cheek
[45:07] they take your cloak or whatever give
[45:10] them your robe dude do the opposite of
[45:11] what they'd expect it disarms the devil
[45:15] someone hates you love them love your
[45:18] enemies do good to those who
[45:19] despitefully use you hallelujah now
[45:24] there's some yeah just just let's just
[45:27] put it on let's shout for a while I
[45:29] mentioned this a while ago but I thought
[45:31] I'm gonna play it make sure is it as a
[45:34] good quality now this is not a typical
[45:36] let's just watch this can anyone see
[45:37] that this is not our footage by the way
[45:40] that would have been real cool now watch
[45:44] this okay here we go now pause it real
[45:51] quick pause pause pause it now what's
[45:55] normally the outcome of that the zebra
[45:59] gets eaten the lion gets fat the devil
[46:03] thinks I'm going to destroy that person
[46:05] what unfortunately normally happens
[46:08] without the Lord the devil destroys a
[46:10] life or cripples our life remember
[46:13] there's healing from anything that that
[46:15] that the devil tries to do against us
[46:16] member so whatever the devil does it's
[46:18] not permanent because we have a blood we
[46:20] have a healing power I mean we have a
[46:23] full restoration promise we're living
[46:24] under a word of full restoration rights
[46:27] it doesn't matter what the devil tries
[46:28] to do to you it cannot be permanent
[46:30] you've got to remember that okay doesn't
[46:32] matter if you're in a pit if you're in
[46:34] darkness doesn't matter remember there's
[46:35] a way out hallelujah
[46:38] okay so that's normally now let's
[46:40] continue I like this here we go he's
[46:43] mama no mama oh yeah
[46:54] [Applause]
[46:57] hallelujah and you know what that lion
[47:00] realized that wasn't like a normal Debra
[47:05] now listen those things live in fear
[47:09] a lion is a fearful animal right the
[47:12] Bible says that the devil walks around
[47:14] like a roaring lion seeking whom shall
[47:16] devour that lion thought it had
[47:18] breakfast but there's something in mama
[47:21] said no you're not getting my little one
[47:22] you're not gonna eat my little one for
[47:25] breakfast you may get someone else in
[47:27] the hood but not mine holler so she
[47:29] overcome her fear and she met that lion
[47:32] head on hallelujah it's the same thing
[47:36] with us friends it's something different
[47:37] about a believer I mean we don't have to
[47:39] say oh I guess so
[47:40] your things will never be the same
[47:42] note we can come against the enemy I
[47:44] meant take him head on a will one oh
[47:47] yeah Goliath I mean David hastened
[47:51] towards the enemy and ran towards him
[47:53] now he is Goliath with a shield and he's
[47:56] got as I'm a bear and things do you
[47:57] think now you know the hurt you're the
[48:00] champion of Israel's gonna come out he's
[48:02] gonna fight like this
[48:03] here comes a shepherd boy he's got his
[48:05] five stones his revelation and a script
[48:07] bag holy he's crossed the brook chair
[48:10] yeah I mean I mean he's crossed the
[48:12] brook he's on his way he knows he didn't
[48:15] brother BAM said David knew it could be
[48:17] done it was revealed to him he comes
[48:20] this enemy what's and then he sews oh no
[48:23] no normally when you watch a David and
[48:25] Goliath film he's David stumbling with
[48:28] some stones standing like this and
[48:29] Goliath is coming towards them like this
[48:31] that's not how it worked here comes
[48:34] David the time of talking's finished
[48:37] David prophesized The Devil's end that's
[48:40] why you've got to speak it you to
[48:42] address your enemy you're going to tell
[48:44] him your has outcome I mean you're gonna
[48:47] tell him your outcome and tell him his
[48:49] outcome that's what David did David take
[48:52] a life you're gonna die and not just you
[48:54] but the host of the Philistines are
[48:56] gonna freak to the beasts of the field
[48:58] into the fowls of the air and I'm gonna
[48:59] cut your head off hallelujah
[49:03] didn't have a soul but that don't matter
[49:05] maybe you're sizing up glass orders and
[49:07] I think that'll work
[49:10] yeah see so it's all the time of
[49:13] talking's done what did brother Kaiser
[49:15] tells the camp speaker outcome speaker
[49:19] outcome not well as me and how's this
[49:21] going to happen on speaker outcomes
[49:23] Lord they're all coming everything the
[49:26] Devils taken from me will be returned
[49:27] it's mine right now
[49:29] kaalia full peace in my mind peace of
[49:31] mind peace of heart
[49:33] holy all my all my doubts cast away all
[49:35] my unbelief cast away my mind bans my
[49:37] condemnation my guilt my shape Jesus
[49:40] take it all hallelujah
[49:43] so it says he hastened towards the
[49:45] Philistine was it he started running he
[49:47] ran he pulled the stone out started
[49:49] swinging it a third at the Philistine
[49:51] and he killed him
[49:52] he wasn't standing it cuz most slingers
[49:54] he the other hand back and they know he
[49:56] ran towards his enemy hallelujah you
[50:00] know the closest you get to a target the
[50:01] easier it is just kill ya you know what
[50:05] the you know what the guides say in
[50:07] Africa they say if something's charging
[50:09] at you and you're shooting it don't
[50:11] shoot it when it's 100 more meters away
[50:13] or 30 meters shoot it when it's right
[50:14] here that's why they can get it in the
[50:17] head don't shoot it in the heart get it
[50:20] in the head because if you get it in the
[50:21] heart while the blood still pumping and
[50:23] it can stick keep running but if you get
[50:25] it in the head it's dead and they showed
[50:28] footage where the guide actually showed
[50:30] them and they killed nothing as a
[50:32] Buffalo saying like literally with that
[50:34] standards they were right here
[50:35] and it landed and it ended up right
[50:38] there feet it's too big to miss you say
[50:43] that takes nerves of steel I'll tell you
[50:45] you've got nerves of steel I mean just
[50:47] yeah you've got nerves of steel we have
[50:49] nothing to be afraid of hallelujah take
[50:52] your slingshot you say it's not too much
[50:54] I tell you that slingshot in the hands
[50:57] of anointed son of God standing in his
[50:58] and his god-given Authority I mean and
[51:02] in his in his inheritance I mean he
[51:04] defeated that Philistine hallelujah and
[51:07] that same God is here today I mean
[51:10] anointing her people I mean not to kill
[51:12] people but to defeat demon powers
[51:15] to destroy their influence to cast them
[51:17] off people I mean to tear Satan's
[51:19] Kingdom down hallelujah we have to the
[51:26] believer acts different oh yeah the
[51:31] devil came against Jesus and Matthew
[51:32] three the great temptations he came
[51:35] against all the other believers but but
[51:37] this one was different
[51:38] hallelujah brother man said it's like he
[51:41] wins with your flow against like at ten
[51:43] thousand volt line goddess feathers all
[51:46] singed hallelujah it should be the same
[51:48] thing when the devil comes against Jews
[51:50] feel that same God as in you hallelujah
[51:53] he couldn't he couldn't conquer them in
[51:55] any way friends were unstoppable
[51:58] the bride is unstoppable I mean the
[52:02] bride is unstoppable you know General
[52:04] Patton there in World War two he just he
[52:06] just believed and just just keep
[52:07] advancing keep advancing don't stop so
[52:11] you get the devil you get the enemy on
[52:12] the run you don't allow him to reinforce
[52:15] you just keep pushing forward I mean you
[52:18] say well oh I'll go the bridge too far
[52:20] I'll fight a battle one too many no you
[52:22] won't
[52:23] amen because the devil says all you may
[52:26] have won before but what about now the
[52:27] same God that gave you the victory back
[52:29] then I'll give it to you now hallelujah
[52:32] there's no such thing as going a bridge
[52:33] too far who understands what I mean by
[52:35] Bruce you far that means you over

[53:50] says you know here we could get a lesson
[53:52] from that the speaking of the scripture
[53:54] and first King 17 that if you have
[53:56] prayed and meet all the requirements
[53:57] that God requires you to meet and still
[54:00] he silent he doesn't say anything and
[54:02] you've met the requirements now what
[54:04] happens then if you know that you have
[54:07] met his requirements and done all you

[54:50] of this day glory to God thank you Lord
[54:53] that I'm your child you know I was
[54:55] thinking I I love the story of Mary
[54:57] going to the tomb and the resurrections
[55:01] taken place and she's looking where is
[55:02] he and she's talking this or you know
[55:05] there's a man that's that's that's
[55:06] talking to her and his woman why do you
[55:08] weep and she thinks he's a gardener and
[55:12] this is Jesus Christ as the resurrected
[55:15] Lord in his glorified body he sees you
[55:20] know and then he just calls her by name
[55:21] changes their whole life just his Mary
[55:24] you know eyes come open it's you oh yeah
[55:26] I was looking for you how to know where
[55:28] you were but here you are
[55:29] hallelujah and he says don't touch me
[55:31] yet cuz I've got to ascend to my god and
[55:35] your God my father and your father
[55:38] hallelujah here he is in his glorified
[55:40] state that I do
[55:41] say this you know if I my children are
[55:44] like me so they have you know to a
[55:48] varying degree to have my strength I
[55:49] have my weaknesses I mean because night
[55:52] cat you know human nature's passed down
[55:55] right so here is our Lord Jesus
[55:57] conquered death eternal glorified body
[56:01] Holly and nothing can hold him he
[56:04] conquered all things he's saying Mary

[56:14] we're family
[56:16] hallelujah here she is in a glorified
[56:18] State Mary you're gonna become like me

[56:22] you well then you'll pick up the glory
[56:24] oh you'll put on a glorified body as
[56:26] well hallelujah I think about that quite
[56:29] a lot because here we are a word has
[56:31] drawn us I mean we just not here as a
[56:33] church people going through a motion and
[56:35] a a word from heaven has come down
[56:37] through a mouth of a prophet a man to
[56:40] get a hold of your soul a man that you
[56:42] would know oh yeah as Jesus hit the Mary
[56:44] Mary you can become like me you got a
[56:47] body waiting
[56:48] don't fear Mary don't weep don't be sad
[56:51] sure a lot of bad things of happening
[56:53] your life is turned upside down you
[56:55] didn't plan this but I knew it was
[56:56] coming but Mary don't worry you would
[56:59] end up like me what do you think they
[57:01] could give their lives gladly well you
[57:03] think the Apostles could look in the
[57:04] eyes of the same Sanhedrin that that had
[57:06] Jesus crucified and said should we serve
[57:08] God or men because they were thinking
[57:11] remember the Sanhedrin they put all the
[57:14] pressure here's all the dignitaries of
[57:16] the religious system of others Rael
[57:19] humanly trying to put pressure on these
[57:20] fishermen but remember they did not
[57:23] think like the rest of the prey like the
[57:27] rest of the people in Israel I mean
[57:29] because they had a different thinking
[57:31] they had the mind of Christ just like if
[57:33] we were in the Kruger National Park we
[57:35] have different thinking to a zebra but
[57:37] if we behave like a zebra anyway and
[57:39] that's not our mama we'll get eaten
[57:41] right but to date but they had the mind
[57:44] of Christ out because now God was in
[57:45] them so they didn't bow to the pressure
[57:47] of the age that you said should we serve
[57:49] God are you God or man who should we
[57:51] police real simple
[57:54] and they put pressure and they beat them
[57:55] with it rule they just rejoiced
[57:57] they said hallelujah hallelujah Mary you
[58:06] got a glorified body coming that's why
[58:10] this message just found you not to make
[58:13] you a different kind of person only you
[58:16] need to know body waiting for you this
[58:20] is a rapture call we're living in a
[58:22] rapture cycle we must never ever forget
[58:25] that amen so where was I
[58:31] faith doesn't waver it just sits still
[58:35] and thinks positive you I got therefore
[58:36] faith takes us everlasting grip around
[58:40] the rock of ages' and doesn't move it's
[58:44] taken hold it doesn't move that's why
[58:49] real faith doesn't fluctuate based on
[58:52] feeling it doesn't fluctuate based on
[58:54] how good your day's going amen it's
[58:57] actually no no no gods gods revealed it
[59:00] it's in a scripture it's quickened to me
[59:01] that's just how it's gonna be doesn't
[59:05] fluctuate that great fellow called faith
[59:08] I've often said faiths got here on the
[59:09] chest when he speaks everything else
[59:12] shuts up when faith says shut up and
[59:14] everything stops cuz he's the boss our
[59:17] human emotion shuts up our feelings shut
[59:20] up because he says that I'm in control
[59:21] of this battle not how you feel it's
[59:24] what you believe never and the devil say
[59:26] oh you don't really believe it then well
[59:28] the devil doesn't believe he just tries
[59:29] to put his experience on you that's not
[59:32] really true well he doesn't really
[59:33] believe it
[59:35] amen hallelujah
[59:39] she had met every requirement she had
[59:42] lived clean
[59:43] she hadn't lived decent she loved
[59:45] honorable she had met all of God's
[59:46] requirements but looked like he was
[59:49] silent God does that some time to test
[59:51] you to see what kind of reaction you'll
[59:54] have he says don't forget it if you pass
[59:58] over the platform you you're prayed for
[1:00:01] on the hands laid on you it seems like
[1:00:04] nothing happens that doesn't stop faith
[1:00:05] one but you have met God
[1:00:08] quirements now if now if you have met
[1:00:10] them now if you're holding back on God
[1:00:12] you know your heart condemns you you
[1:00:14] know if our hearts condemn us not then
[1:00:16] we have now live our hearts condemn us
[1:00:19] there's no need coming across the
[1:00:21] platform there's no need of asking God
[1:00:22] for anything because you don't have
[1:00:24] faith to receive it that when you meet
[1:00:25] every requirement God requires then
[1:00:28] faith steps out this is God as God I've
[1:00:30] met the requirements hallelujah
[1:00:35] why are you saying these things we've
[1:00:40] got to understand we are not here too
[1:00:44] big we don't have too big the devil to
[1:00:47] give up nothing we have a right to tell
[1:00:49] him get out and he has to obey your
[1:00:52] voice you say I've just been a believer
[1:00:54] a day you should still has to obey your
[1:00:56] voice hey man he said well I fall every
[1:00:59] day just get back up that's not him the
[1:01:01] fools at home that gets back up that's
[1:01:03] overcoming hallelujah Tim that wins the
[1:01:06] war amen
[1:01:07] that rights history that's not them that
[1:01:09] when the battle is in that when the war
[1:01:11] is the victor hallelujah you know
[1:01:14] Abraham Lincoln would stand for public
[1:01:16] office for about 11 times about that
[1:01:18] then he became president there's
[1:01:21] something NMC do I want to become
[1:01:22] president he failed many times but he
[1:01:24] got there how that's like us I mean we
[1:01:27] may found many times but we'll get there
[1:01:29] because his blood hallelujah he made an
[1:01:32] atonement for us he's gonna see us
[1:01:33] through hallelujah David he behaved in a
[1:01:42] way that was different to any foe
[1:01:44] Goliath met and Goliath died how about
[1:01:50] you you say I'm being fought the devil's
[1:01:53] fighting me fighting me fighting me you
[1:01:55] got to do something different than what
[1:01:56] normal people do yes you got to take God
[1:01:59] at His Word why is the city you know the
[1:02:02] gates of pearl and the New Jerusalem why
[1:02:04] is it called that because a pearl is
[1:02:07] formed in a clam by a little piece of
[1:02:10] sand that gets in and the and you know
[1:02:12] and it's an irritation and in the clam
[1:02:14] eventually it becomes a pearl why well
[1:02:19] why the gates pearl was like an
[1:02:22] irritation the devil fighting us creates
[1:02:24] an entranceway into the promises of God
[1:02:26] it's all for our good he say this
[1:02:29] thing's buffeting me and he's fighting
[1:02:31] me it'll just create an entranceway and
[1:02:33] to the promise of God I mean other
[1:02:36] people cower under it but now the
[1:02:38] believer says no this has given me an
[1:02:40] entrance this is for my good Lord you
[1:02:42] know what I need and Here I am
[1:02:44] hallelujah glory to God who wants an
[1:02:47] entrance way Amen say you know don't
[1:02:51] don't be discouraged keep pressing the
[1:02:54] battle you know Winston Churchill would
[1:02:56] stand and he would give an address to a
[1:02:58] school and you know what he said never
[1:03:01] give up never give up this is in the
[1:03:04] height of World War two never give up
[1:03:05] and he would make a famous speech winner
[1:03:08] when when when the chips were down and
[1:03:10] and and and they were wondering is as
[1:03:12] England really gonna stand Nazi Germany
[1:03:14] was already there on the French
[1:03:16] coastline
[1:03:17] Dunkirk it just happened England was
[1:03:19] against the wall and he would make a
[1:03:20] famous speech two words of this effect
[1:03:22] will fight them on the beaches will
[1:03:24] fight them in the hedgerows will never
[1:03:26] give up will never surrender and one man
[1:03:28] was anointed to withstand now that's
[1:03:31] just under Pluto
[1:03:32] this is in the political realm how much
[1:03:34] more the Bride of Christ holy will never
[1:03:37] give up doesn't matter how big the enemy
[1:03:40] hey David saw the whole host of the
[1:03:42] Philistines he says I'm gonna feed them
[1:03:43] all outside was here and I'm gonna end
[1:03:46] up with all of them holy it did and he
[1:03:48] had five stars in a script back because
[1:03:50] Goliath had brothers and he had sons it
[1:03:54] saw something in him said well if I
[1:03:56] gotta kill them all today well let's
[1:03:57] just get to it pablor a deal was an

[1:04:11] place up and the and the man who thought
[1:04:14] that he owned the town the bully he said
[1:04:17] no no there's no revivals being held in

[1:04:23] ownership peter Cartwright's washing
[1:04:25] windows and doing things you're busy and
[1:04:27] then the man walks in trying to
[1:04:28] intimidate
[1:04:29] he had intimidated many people but he's
[1:04:32] gonna find out this guy's different
[1:04:35] just like that line found out that zebra
[1:04:37] is different and and and so so he said

[1:04:42] up we're having a revival and and and is
[1:04:45] it not no you're not not in my town we

[1:04:49] Peter Cartwright stop washing windows
[1:04:51] rolled up her sleeves took off his coat
[1:04:52] whatever more he said I must fight if I
[1:04:54] must rain you know and and and the bully
[1:04:57] said weld yet there wouldn't be to have
[1:04:59] a revival I said well okay I'll whip you
[1:05:00] so it picks him up meshes and my little
[1:05:03] boots he's heavy had enough amen and he
[1:05:06] had the revival and that man came to the
[1:05:09] Lord they're a whole group of them came
[1:05:11] into one of the meetings and and they're
[1:05:14] a whole bunch of preachers were afraid
[1:05:15] to preach because they're intimidated by
[1:05:17] these bullies he he preached the meeting
[1:05:19] and before that he would actually
[1:05:21] whupped every one of them hallelujah he
[1:05:25] say you should people really do that
[1:05:27] they did that back then but brother
[1:05:30] Brown would stand there under the
[1:05:31] anointing and a demon-possessed man
[1:05:33] would come up before him so I'm gonna
[1:05:36] tear you limb from limb
[1:05:38] well the brand was trained to be a boxer
[1:05:40] but we don't fight against flesh and
[1:05:42] blood that may have been under the
[1:05:44] Philadelphian age or whatever age Peter
[1:05:45] Cartwright was in right there was
[1:05:48] something NMC I'm not going to bow to
[1:05:49] the intimidation of man and that big
[1:05:51] bully came up before brother Brown young
[1:05:53] a tear you limb from limb and brother I
[1:05:56] said no cuz you've challenged the Spirit
[1:05:57] of God God speaking through them you're
[1:05:59] gonna have confidence when God speaks
[1:06:00] through you it's more member member when
[1:06:02] you're when you're facing the enemy it's
[1:06:04] not you standing alone I mean he's
[1:06:06] actually challenging God hallelujah do
[1:06:10] you think about all of us who are
[1:06:11] married I mean when someone comes
[1:06:13] against our wives who are they
[1:06:14] challenging and who actually should
[1:06:17] stand up and take the challenge where is
[1:06:20] he you'll die quickly or slowly I'll see
[1:06:23] what kind of mood I'm in today no that's
[1:06:26] how it should be how dare they come
[1:06:28] against my wife hallelujah so now he's a
[1:06:33] part of the bride in his position the
[1:06:35] devil's challenging the bride of Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ and God speaks through the
[1:06:40] Prophet says because he challenged the
[1:06:42] Spirit of God you'll fall at my feet
[1:06:43] he's I'll show you whose feet will will
[1:06:45] fall on who he goes to swing he turns
[1:06:47] only falls down at his feet
[1:06:48] like a dead man why because brother Brad
[1:06:54] stayed in a spiritual atmosphere that
[1:06:57] man spit in his face trying to get him
[1:06:59] into the flesh but brother Brad wasn't
[1:07:02] and he didn't act like maybe other
[1:07:03] preachers because he was different we
[1:07:07] should be the same way people get mad at
[1:07:10] you they come against you you know that
[1:07:12] should be good
[1:07:12] you sure yeah good I'm on the right
[1:07:14] track hallelujah
[1:07:18] we must find if we must rain increase my
[1:07:21] courage Lord rest the battle like never
[1:07:23] before
[1:07:24] amen hello yeah I don't know I think
[1:07:30] it's brother Eid put it in the welcome
[1:07:31] pack on for Saturday what we need
[1:07:35] tonight is men a woman knows their
[1:07:37] position in Jesus crisis from this
[1:07:38] warrior David and when the devil makes
[1:07:41] his big boast sure he makes his boast
[1:07:43] he's still making his boast does he make
[1:07:46] his boast you're not going in a rapture
[1:07:48] you really think you're a believer
[1:07:49] there's nothing to this word there's
[1:07:51] nothing to this message it's just a
[1:07:53] bunch of whatever conspiracy stuff and
[1:07:56] y'all it's just a bunch of whatever he's
[1:07:57] making his boast but there's a people
[1:08:01] upon the earth I believe I'm looking at
[1:08:03] I mean they don't just talk about the
[1:08:04] message they've experienced the one who
[1:08:06] sent it which is our Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:08:08] mean when this puts on flesh it's too
[1:08:11] late for for some atheist to come and
[1:08:13] tell me God isn't real because I met him
[1:08:15] I mean it's too late for an atheist say
[1:08:18] Jesus Christ is not alive I'm sorry I
[1:08:20] met him I don't need to go back through
[1:08:23] history and they got all the
[1:08:25] archaeological evidence for everything
[1:08:26] from Genesis 1 till now to actually
[1:08:28] prove it in my mind it's real though I
[1:08:30] meant the earth or the book yes color
[1:08:33] yeah I don't need you guys to Peter
[1:08:35] Kenyon I don't need to go with the ACA's
[1:08:37] in Turkey I don't need to go to
[1:08:38] Jerusalem I made the author of the book
[1:08:41] hallelujah
[1:08:44] amen that is you know what is the
[1:08:48] evidence II he came out of the tomb I
[1:08:51] met him this became a living reality
[1:08:56] hallelujah more than books and tapes I
[1:08:59] tell you when you hear that seals I mean
[1:09:03] the first time I heard that seals I'm
[1:09:04] just going to talk to you a little bit
[1:09:05] when I first heard the seals
[1:09:07] I saw horse riders when I heard it again
[1:09:09] I saw the lamb come forth with my
[1:09:13] redemption he prevailed I'm in
[1:09:16] Revelation 4 and 5 is more than a
[1:09:18] chapter it's going to become alive to
[1:09:20] you he said where's my redeemer he sits
[1:09:23] raw from the eternities to you
[1:09:24] maybe lays claim on you says your mind
[1:09:26] puts you up hallelujah
[1:09:28] takes you to us bosom carries you away
[1:09:30] Oh hallelujah they begin to unfold the
[1:09:33] secret of your life in the word Amen
[1:09:38] anywho that's got to become an
[1:09:42] experience a revelation you know I read
[1:09:46] a history of the church and the Old
[1:09:49] Testament God was known by a revelation
[1:09:51] God became real to the people
[1:09:53] Abraham met God it was a revelation all
[1:09:56] the way down through they met God but
[1:09:59] then when the New Testament era came in
[1:10:01] and nothing against the people but the
[1:10:03] Greeks had it in their mind a revelation
[1:10:05] was learning and then that came into the
[1:10:08] Christian Church learning something they
[1:10:11] actually swapped revelation God
[1:10:13] revealing himself supernaturally to
[1:10:16] learning and that's been all the way
[1:10:18] down through but they're now in this day
[1:10:21] the church is built upon the rock of
[1:10:24] Revelation when God makes himself real
[1:10:27] to you that's why you can't be
[1:10:30] intimidated so people say well where is
[1:10:31] that you know people try and challenge
[1:10:33] you on what you couldn't remember it's
[1:10:36] not about what you can remember it's who
[1:10:38] you know and you'll find yourself
[1:10:40] actually living this out automatically
[1:10:43] without even being able to quote it
[1:10:45] chapter and verse that's why Paul meets
[1:10:49] God Peters already met God Paul comes
[1:10:52] and has fellowship with Peter Paul knows
[1:10:54] exactly in the scripture everything is
[1:10:57] he is a fisherman they have fellowship
[1:11:00] Paul shows Peter where what he's talking
[1:11:03] about is in the scripture it's the same
[1:11:07] God leading them that what how could
[1:11:10] they be preaching the same thing because
[1:11:11] it's divine revelation sure he makes his
[1:11:17] boast he still making his boast what we
[1:11:19] got Goliath and we still got David's
[1:11:26] two-color David's how you anointed on
[1:11:30] your way to the throne every enemy
[1:11:33] they'll come against you shall fall at
[1:11:34] your feet you would have confidence on
[1:11:37] the one that's called you not me the one

[1:11:43] called you hallelujah
