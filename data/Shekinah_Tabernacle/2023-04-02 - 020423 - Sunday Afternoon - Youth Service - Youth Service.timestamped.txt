[17:24] thank you
[17:26] [Music]
[17:34] um
[17:41] amen
[17:42] amen so today
[17:45] I wanted to talk about their reward for
[17:47] overcoming
[17:49] so let's first read a scripture in um
[17:53] Book of Revelations
[18:01] revelation 22 14 and verse 15. said um
[18:06] and behold I come quickly and my reward
[18:09] is with me to give every man according
[18:11] as his work shall be I am Alpha and
[18:15] Omega the beginning and the end the
[18:17] first and the last blizzard are they
[18:20] that do these Commandments that they may
[18:23] have right to the tree of life and may
[18:25] enter into the gates into the city amen
[18:29] and let's read another description in
[18:31] Revelation chapter 3 verse
[18:34] 21 and 22.
[18:39] the Bible says to him that overcometh
[18:41] will I grant to see it with me in my
[18:45] throne even as I also overcame
[18:48] and I'm sat down with my father in his
[18:50] throne
[18:51] he that has
[18:53] an ear let them hear what the spirit
[18:55] says unto the churches
[18:58] amen let's pray almighty God we want to
[19:01] give you thanks for this day we want to
[19:03] ask you to be in this meeting Lauren
[19:06] please talk to me use me Lord be with us
[19:09] we ask you this in the name of the Lord
[19:11] Jesus Christ amen amen
[19:14] so um
[19:16] first
[19:18] you can you may have it now sorry I'm
[19:20] not I'm not gonna do a David
[19:23] so I want to say it's sorry to brother a
[19:26] man because
[19:27] that was a dog when I said that he he
[19:30] but I forgot to laugh because he told me
[19:33] you need a miracle to sing good and that
[19:35] was a joke I laughed with him but I
[19:37] didn't laugh when I was here because I
[19:38] was nervous but mama's sorry brother but
[19:41] I love you brother
[19:44] I am
[19:47] so um
[19:49] you know me a little bit so you know
[19:50] that I'm a happy person and I don't get
[19:53] this courage um easily but not everyone
[19:56] is like me we have people that they can
[19:58] get discouraged very easily so I want to
[20:01] talk about these rewards that we're
[20:04] gonna get and that we are getting too
[20:07] um
[20:08] so now um we know that we go through
[20:11] deep valleys and high mountains so for
[20:14] me I didn't enjoy the lockdown at all
[20:16] because uh that kept working through
[20:18] because I I was working at dairy farm so
[20:20] we didn't stop now like some of you they
[20:22] just stopped like two months or
[20:24] something it didn't stop at all I just
[20:25] keep working but like um one month ago I
[20:29] almost cut my finger I didn't cut them
[20:31] but I didn't chopped them off
[20:34] so I stayed at home for like three weeks
[20:36] and we spent just such a nice time with
[20:38] my wife
[20:39] and you know when the people were in the
[20:42] lockdown the rates of the voters went up
[20:46] to the roof but for us was such a good
[20:48] time to be together so I praise the Lord
[20:51] for that
[20:53] and also it helped me to understand why
[20:56] sometimes when I arrived home she was a
[20:58] little bit like stressed because of bad
[21:00] life because man she looked can look
[21:02] cute but she can fast
[21:04] [Music]
[21:07] but we love it
[21:10] so um
[21:12] I went to Google and I
[21:15] searched the definition of reward so the
[21:18] word we word means um a thing given in
[21:21] recognition of service effort or
[21:24] achievement
[21:25] so we know as Christians as we receive
[21:27] the Holy Ghost
[21:29] we're not doing anything at all it's
[21:31] just the Holy Ghost doing all the work
[21:33] yeah
[21:34] so for us it's it's easy when we receive
[21:37] the Holy Ghost
[21:38] so we we just need to give up the world
[21:41] and the pleasures of the world and
[21:43] embrace the cross and it came to my mind
[21:46] Hebrews 12.
[21:49] because when you know when you read
[21:50] Hebrew Hebrews 12 you can see all the
[21:53] fathers of the faith yeah and they are
[21:56] mentioned they're like perfect they had
[21:58] Faith by faith Noah his faith condemned
[22:01] the entire will
[22:03] but in the Bible also said that Noah got
[22:05] drunk but when it's there
[22:08] that sin is not there anymore he's just
[22:10] man no that's not there anymore amen
[22:14] amen
[22:17] so I want to give you that trophy for
[22:20] you because if you are here this
[22:21] afternoon or you are watching this
[22:23] online
[22:24] that means that you are submitting your
[22:26] flesh unto the Lord's will
[22:28] it's good we need to be honest and no
[22:31] who normal person would like to be here
[22:33] like on a Sunday you can go to fish
[22:36] fishing or do whatever but there is
[22:39] something inside of you that wants more
[22:41] from the Lord
[22:42] it actually wrote something here about
[22:45] um
[22:46] we are making a statement to the world
[22:49] saying that we are the Bride of God and
[22:52] that we cannot get enough of him we want
[22:54] more of him and actually remember one of
[22:57] the lines that brother bran preached in
[22:58] Chile and he mentioned the same thing
[23:00] here today
[23:02] he said we are fulfillment of a prophecy
[23:05] because once was said that there will be
[23:07] a bride and surprise here we are so if
[23:11] you are here you are awesome so you can
[23:13] take that one home today
[23:18] so I have a
[23:20] some scriptures so I'm gonna ask
[23:23] more
[23:25] is it on
[23:27] well if you cannot see it you can get
[23:28] closer
[23:30] if I um
[23:33] scripture in Matthew 20
[23:36] can you read more please for the Kingdom
[23:38] of Heaven is like unto a man that is an
[23:42] household
[23:43] which went out early in the morning to
[23:46] hear sorry I can't do that to end when
[23:50] he had agreed with the laborers for a
[23:54] penny a day he sent them out into his
[23:56] Vineyard and
[23:59] and he labeled and
[24:02] and the laborers into the vineyard into
[24:05] his Vineyard
[24:06] went out about the third hour and saw
[24:11] others standing idle in the marketplace
[24:15] and said unto them go ye also into the
[24:18] vineyard and whosoever is right I will
[24:21] give I will give you
[24:23] and they went their way
[24:27] again he went out in about the sixth
[24:30] hour and the ninth hour and did likewise
[24:33] and about the 11th hour he went out and
[24:37] found other standing Idol and saved unto
[24:40] them why Stanley here all day Idol they
[24:44] say unto him because no man hath hired
[24:47] us he say offense them go ye also into
[24:51] the vineyard and whatsoever is right
[24:55] that shall you receive so when even was
[24:59] come
[25:00] the Lord of The Vineyard saith unto his
[25:05] Steward call the laborers and give them
[25:08] their higher
[25:10] begin from the last and to the first and
[25:14] when they came that were hired about the
[25:17] 11th Hour they received Every Man a
[25:20] penny but when the first come they
[25:24] suppose they suppose that they should
[25:28] receive more
[25:30] they should have received more and they
[25:33] likewise received
[25:34] Every Man a penny and when they had
[25:38] received it they murmured against the
[25:41] good man of his house saying these last
[25:44] have wrought but one hour and thou has
[25:47] made them equal unto us which have
[25:51] been born and burdened
[25:54] the Heat of the day
[25:56] but his but he answered unto them and
[25:59] said friend I do not
[26:02] I I do see no wrong this thou agree for
[26:08] me agree me for a penny
[26:12] but uh or is it
[26:15] um take that thine is and go away I will
[26:20] give unto the lost even unto thee it is
[26:25] it is not lawful for me to do what I
[26:29] will not with my own
[26:31] this thine evil eye because I am good so
[26:36] the last shall be first and the first
[26:38] shall be and the first last for many
[26:41] cold but few chosen thank you Mom
[26:45] you're gonna be a reward on Wednesday
[26:47] for reading that I'm gonna buy you
[26:49] something brother
[26:51] so we can see here that we are all gonna
[26:54] receive pretty much the same reward
[26:57] so if because I I know someone
[27:00] he was very old when he gives his life
[27:03] to the law and like within like one
[27:05] month he died
[27:06] and he's gonna receive the reward same
[27:09] as us
[27:10] and probably you we can feel that at all
[27:12] man
[27:13] they're reward they're just so big that
[27:16] we cannot be like angry because of that
[27:18] amen
[27:19] so I went to Mr Google again
[27:22] and I found this guy
[27:24] he's Randy Hagen he's a retired colonel
[27:27] from the USA army and I was trying to
[27:30] find which ones are like the medals more
[27:33] difficult or hard to get
[27:36] so he said that the the Bronze Star
[27:39] metal is very hard to get and is is an
[27:42] awarded for heroism in combat zone zone
[27:45] or meritorial service in a war zone it's
[27:48] very hard to get you need to be really
[27:50] Brave
[27:52] Also let's talk about the Silver Star
[27:55] metal so it's awarded for gallantry in
[27:57] action
[27:58] very hard to get and the most
[28:02] the middle that more hard to get is a
[28:05] medal of honor and it's awarded for
[28:08] gallantry and in trip intrepidated
[28:10] that's how you say that at risk of Life
[28:13] above and beyond the Call of Duty
[28:16] in the end saying
[28:20] so metals are not prices to be competed
[28:23] for and and instead a recognition for
[28:26] actions taken in time of work last note
[28:29] they are countless individual in the
[28:32] history of military who did as much or
[28:35] more than those who receive recognition
[28:37] but because they were too few who
[28:40] witnessed those actions those Heroes
[28:43] never receive official recognition and
[28:46] that's quite sad but we know that we
[28:48] have a God that he sees everything
[28:50] and everything is there it's written
[28:52] there so everything what you do for the
[28:54] law there is a record there and you are
[28:57] gonna receive your reward
[28:59] amen
[29:01] I found that
[29:02] that image that says what success looks
[29:05] to me yeah and that's pretty much what
[29:08] success looked to me
[29:11] so in the Bible
[29:13] speaks about Five Crowns that we can get
[29:15] and I was talking to brother Ben last
[29:17] night and it's not that we are gonna
[29:19] have five hits
[29:21] we're gonna receive Five Crowns that
[29:23] pretty much is the same one but this
[29:25] hits so much meaning that have different
[29:27] names so it's a Crown of Life The
[29:30] Incorruptible Crown the crown of
[29:32] righteousness the Crown of Glory the
[29:35] crown of rejoicing so you are going to
[29:37] have a crown because you're gonna be a
[29:38] king and a priest what we're gonna get
[29:41] there soon
[29:42] also in the in the seven eight churches
[29:45] in Revelation 2 and 3 start to speak and
[29:50] also give um
[29:52] a couple of rewards too the first one is
[29:55] that the right to eat from the Tree of
[29:58] Life second one the Crown of Life a
[30:00] white stone and a new name third one the
[30:03] hidden Mana authority over the Nations
[30:06] and the morning star fifth the dreaded
[30:09] in white never blow out his name from
[30:12] The Book of Life
[30:13] sixth a pillar in the temple and seventh
[30:17] sit with me on my Throne so brother we
[30:21] are going to receive a really big reward
[30:24] my brother
[30:27] so there is some reward that we can get
[30:30] here in on Earth
[30:31] and I like that that image that picture
[30:33] I can feel it like Bella when I hold her
[30:36] because she doesn't have to worry about
[30:38] anything
[30:39] I we have to provide for him we we just
[30:43] take care of her and I think that's the
[30:45] way that the Lord look at unto us
[30:48] so here there's some attribute of God
[30:51] Jehovah Jireh
[30:53] means the Lord will provide a sacrifice
[30:56] he's our provider
[30:57] and I have a
[30:59] it's not like a big one but I I love
[31:02] this example because
[31:04] when I start to work for Isaac in Andy I
[31:06] went there
[31:08] to the factory and I went to Market and
[31:11] get it quite close and I saw this
[31:13] earmuffs that it had Bluetooth too so
[31:16] you can use the Air Max and listen music
[31:18] or a sermon or whatever
[31:19] I didn't talk to Isaac but I saw them
[31:22] and I was like man I really want to give
[31:24] them but I didn't have the money because
[31:25] they were like 150 bucks
[31:27] I didn't say anything I just keep
[31:29] working and then Isaac he went to miter
[31:31] 10 and came back with the box and said
[31:33] look what I bought you
[31:35] and I was like man so shocked that the
[31:37] Lord just revealed to him whatever I
[31:40] wanted this something so small but to me
[31:42] meant it means hips you know
[31:45] also I remember
[31:48] also yeah like one year ago I said I
[31:50] prayed to the Lord in my car because
[31:51] that way I have my own revivals when I'm
[31:54] driving to work and come back
[31:56] so I said to the lord I can't provide
[31:59] for my family
[32:00] I'm not doing it so I want you to
[32:02] provide for my family
[32:03] and from then on
[32:05] pay rise and everything and I were like
[32:07] so happy I never talked to Isaac about
[32:10] pay rights or anything it's just the
[32:12] Lord
[32:13] talking
[32:14] um talking to him
[32:16] amen the another attribute of God is
[32:19] Jehovah Rapha it means the Lord that
[32:22] healeth thee and we know that he's our
[32:24] healer
[32:25] another one is Jehovah it means the Lord
[32:27] is present and that's where I have my my
[32:30] own Revival driving the driving the car
[32:32] in the morning listening the song in
[32:34] this this sometimes I am just driving
[32:35] the internet just start to cry don't
[32:37] know why it's just the Lord is here with
[32:39] me amen
[32:42] the Lord is our peace Jehovah Nissi the
[32:46] Lord
[32:47] Jehovah the lover is my shepherd is that
[32:50] how you say that Raw
[32:53] Raw
[32:54] Jehovah the Lord without righteousness
[32:57] so the law is everything to us
[33:01] so in according to receive all these um
[33:04] rewards we need to go to the basic so we
[33:08] need to go to the beginning of
[33:10] everything
[33:11] so to receive other words we really need
[33:15] the Holy Ghost
[33:16] so that's the first one and we know how
[33:18] to receive the Holy Ghost because it's
[33:19] like quite like instruction repent be
[33:22] baptized and you will receive the gift
[33:24] of the Holy Ghost
[33:26] so once we have the Holy Ghost is that
[33:29] everything is on track we are on Wheels
[33:31] it's nothing can stop us just pretty
[33:34] much
[33:35] we made it yeah
[33:37] amen so we can read here can you can
[33:40] where's the mic
[33:42] can you give the mic to Ruben please and
[33:44] I have another scripture here in John 14
[33:46] verse
[33:48] 25. can you read it please
[33:51] these things have I spoken unto you
[33:53] being yet present with you but the
[33:56] Comfort which is the Holy Ghost whom the
[34:00] father will send in my name he shall
[34:02] teach you all things and bring all
[34:06] things to you remember
[34:08] um to your remembrance who who's over I
[34:11] will send unto you
[34:14] peace I leave with you my peace I give
[34:17] unto you not as the world giveth give I
[34:21] unto you
[34:22] let let not your heart be troubled
[34:26] neither Let It Be Afraid
[34:29] amen so once we receive the Holy Ghost
[34:33] the Holy Ghost start to work in our life
[34:35] and start to change everything from the
[34:38] inside out
[34:39] amen so that's very important to receive
[34:42] the hood
[34:43] that's very important in terms of the
[34:45] Holy Ghost
[34:46] another of the rewards that we can get
[34:49] that we are gonna get
[34:51] is a body change
[34:53] and I have
[34:56] they're quite cool dude there
[34:59] the one over there it's Brother Andy
[35:02] when he was young were you like 20
[35:05] something
[35:08] second one is brother Isaac
[35:10] and there's been a Christian
[35:13] I'm assuming that you were like early
[35:15] 20s right yeah
[35:18] so our bodies needs to be transformed
[35:25] it's quite funny because sometimes I I
[35:27] put myself like in the in the young
[35:29] group but I'm not young anymore
[35:31] the other day there was a little girl
[35:33] that said to me
[35:35] and I was like
[35:36] [Laughter]
[35:41] can you give the microphone to Jonah
[35:43] please
[35:44] to read this scripture it's in First
[35:47] Corinthians 15.
[35:51] is it
[35:53] as is the Earthly Searcher they also
[35:56] there are Earth
[35:58] earthy and as is the Heavenly such are
[36:02] the are they also there are Heavenly and
[36:06] as we born the image of the Earthly we
[36:09] shall also bear the image of the
[36:11] heavenly now this I say prison that that
[36:15] fresh and blood cannot enter inherit the
[36:19] kingdom of God Amen neither does
[36:21] corruption and and hear it in corruption
[36:24] behold I assure you a mystery we shall
[36:27] not all sleep but we shall all be
[36:30] changed Amen in a moment in the thinking
[36:33] of an eye at the last Trump for the
[36:35] trumpet shall sound and the dead shall
[36:38] be raised incorruptable and we shall be
[36:41] changed for this for this corruptable
[36:44] must be must put on in corruption that
[36:48] and this Mortal must put on immortality
[36:52] so when we win this corruptable shall
[36:56] have put on in corruption and this
[36:59] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[37:02] then shall be brought to us that's the
[37:07] saying that is written death death is
[37:10] swallowed up in Victory
[37:12] the way as they sting oh grave where's
[37:14] thy Victory The Sting of death or sin
[37:17] and the strength and of sin is the law
[37:20] but thanks to be to God which giveth us
[37:24] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[37:26] Christ therefore my beloved Brethren be
[37:29] ye steadfast and movable always about
[37:32] abounding in the work of the Lord for as
[37:35] much as you know that your labor is not
[37:39] in a in vain in the Lord amen it's not
[37:42] in vain we're going to be rewarded amen
[37:45] so
[37:46] I had a quick chat with Andy and brother
[37:49] um
[37:50] been well they were having lunch and I
[37:53] asked them about the body change
[37:56] because
[37:57] from now on it's going to sound like I'm
[38:00] trying to sell you something like a
[38:02] Salesman
[38:03] because it's just so many awards and
[38:06] they are just so good but they are in
[38:08] the Bible so I'm not trying to
[38:11] sell you something it's just there okay
[38:14] so that when when we get the body change
[38:16] it's a Immortal body right cannot diet
[38:19] we're gonna be young again
[38:23] we're also going to have the spoken word
[38:25] right to call things into existence
[38:28] so we can create planets so if if you
[38:31] have seen any um comic or something
[38:33] about a hero that can be here because
[38:35] you're gonna have power
[38:37] you're gonna have power you it's gonna
[38:39] be awesome amen
[38:42] also I have a quote here it's brother
[38:45] Branham
[38:47] saying well the church has come through
[38:49] justification sanctification baptism of
[38:52] the Holy Ghost give manifested to it and
[38:55] now what the spirit of God moving in the
[38:58] church doing the same works that Jesus
[38:59] did before he lived as a promise and
[39:03] what's the next thing the change the
[39:05] next thing happened to Abraham was a
[39:08] body change he had to change it and he
[39:11] never got the Sun
[39:12] they were written right and the next
[39:15] thing happens to the church is a rapture
[39:18] will have to be changed and caught up in
[39:21] the air to meet him we can't meet him on
[39:24] Earth with God to go in the air to meet
[39:27] him it's a it's a coming it's the coming
[39:30] Sun the promised son amen we've looked
[39:34] for him now for a hundred of years we
[39:37] will
[39:39] he will come someday but the next thing
[39:41] for the church it's
[39:44] to be changed we had every sign
[39:47] justification sanctification baptism of
[39:50] the Holy Spirit placing of Islam
[39:52] manifestation of the spirit now what the
[39:55] changing of the Body for the Rapture
[39:58] that was on the 61. so how much clothes
[40:00] we are now to receive the the body
[40:03] change
[40:04] so once our bodies change
[40:08] we are gonna proceed with the rapture
[40:12] amen
[40:13] so if we read here in first
[40:15] Thessalonians chapter 4
[40:17] verse 15 says for this we say unto
[40:22] you by the word of the Lord that we
[40:25] which are alive and remain unto the
[40:27] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[40:29] them which are asleep for the Lord
[40:31] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[40:34] shout with the voice of Archangel and
[40:36] with the Trump of God and the death in
[40:39] Christ shall rise first then we which
[40:43] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[40:45] together with them in the clouds to meet
[40:48] the law in the air and so shall we ever
[40:51] be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one
[40:54] another with this word amen
[40:57] man what a statement
[40:59] so we're gonna receive our Lord
[41:02] I have another
[41:03] um word for um
[41:06] for the Rapture that I talk in Tauranga
[41:08] once
[41:12] um if I can find it
[41:19] no I don't have it but the way was
[41:22] extraction and in the military
[41:26] um like thing extraction it happened
[41:29] when everything is just so bad that
[41:32] there needs to go there to rescue the
[41:35] people and take them to a friendly uh
[41:38] environment and that's what we are
[41:41] waiting for we we really need an
[41:43] extraction because this is just getting
[41:44] so bad my brother
[41:47] so once we received the Holy Ghost
[41:51] um our bodies is gonna get change
[41:54] we can be we can became Kings and priest
[41:58] amen
[41:59] so if we read um Revelation 1
[42:02] says um verse five and from Jesus Christ
[42:06] who is a faithful witness and the first
[42:09] begotten of the dead and the prince of
[42:11] the kings of the earth unto him that
[42:13] loved us and watched us from our sins in
[42:17] his own blood and
[42:19] hath made as Kings and Priests and
[42:23] Queens I'm going to head there unto God
[42:26] and his father to him be glory and
[42:28] Dominion forever and ever amen
[42:31] so yes you're gonna be a king all of you
[42:35] you're gonna be Kings
[42:37] and
[42:39] I listen once in the same like when you
[42:41] are a king
[42:42] in
[42:44] when you're like in a royal family
[42:46] there is so many things that they are
[42:48] waiting for you to to achieve you know
[42:51] back in the days you had to be good with
[42:53] the soul and you have to be smart and do
[42:55] heaps of things and remember everything
[42:57] that you do
[42:59] you are a king and there is some things
[43:01] that they are not
[43:03] good for a king to do
[43:05] you are a king so you have to live with
[43:08] the thing in your mind okay
[43:10] the next thing if we are Kings and
[43:12] Priests we're gonna need a city
[43:14] so here we have the Golden City the New
[43:17] Jerusalem I didn't put a scripture with
[43:21] um
[43:22] how glorious is this it is going to be
[43:26] about the stretch of gold
[43:28] and this is the Sea of Crystal the
[43:31] crystal sea and the Gate of pair
[43:34] so it's going to be awesome so can you
[43:36] can you pass a mic to someone with some
[43:41] man they're helping me so much thank you
[43:44] guys
[43:45] can you read this in Revelation to the
[43:47] first
[43:56] Out of Heaven prepared
[43:58] prepaid as a bride adorned
[44:03] for her husband
[44:04] he that overcometh shout and hear all
[44:07] things and I will be his God and he
[44:11] shall be my son
[44:12] but the fearful and unbelieving and the
[44:17] album
[44:20] abominable and murderers
[44:25] and
[44:26] one more
[44:29] humongous and sauce
[44:33] saucers and
[44:36] I don't I'd
[44:38] adulterers and all liars shall shall
[44:43] have their part in the lake which burned
[44:45] with fire and brimstone which is the
[44:49] second death
[44:50] hey man
[44:52] so we are gonna have the good side of
[44:55] that thing we are not gonna be cast
[44:57] turned amen I'm asking the kids to read
[45:00] because
[45:01] I can't read all English that's the
[45:03] truth to be honest I can't
[45:06] so we go we're gonna be king priest
[45:08] we're gonna have we're gonna live in the
[45:10] holy city
[45:11] so we need a kingdom and that kingdom is
[45:13] going to be the millennial Kingdom where
[45:16] everything is going to be restored to
[45:18] the first state so this Earth is going
[45:21] to be burned
[45:23] and everything is going to be back to
[45:25] the to the original
[45:27] and there is a scripture here in Isaiah
[45:30] 65 saying the wolf and the lamb shall
[45:33] fit together and the lion shall eat
[45:35] straw like the Bullock
[45:37] and that shall be the syrup and meat
[45:42] they shall not hurt nor destroy in all
[45:45] my holy mountains saith the Lord amen
[45:48] that's waiting for us
[45:52] when I'm about to finish now
[45:53] and the last one that I wrote here there
[45:55] is many many other ones but I just put
[45:58] the ones that that I like the most
[46:00] so here's the eternity with our creator
[46:05] so here in Revelation 21st we can read
[46:08] and God shall wipe away
[46:11] all tears from their eyes and there
[46:13] shall be no more death neither sorrow no
[46:16] crying neither shall there be any more
[46:19] pain for the former things are passed
[46:22] away
[46:22] and he hath you know he can someone read
[46:26] that thing please guys
[46:28] and he that sat upon the throne said
[46:31] behold I make things new and he said
[46:35] unto me right for these words are true
[46:39] and faithful
[46:40] and he said unto me I done
[46:44] it is done I am Alpha and Omega the
[46:46] beginning and the end I will give unto
[46:50] him that is
[46:54] artist and of the
[46:57] Fountain of water of Life freely
[47:01] he that Overcomers shall inherit all
[47:04] things and I will be his God and he
[47:08] shall be my son amen
[47:11] what a beautiful thing is that one yeah
[47:13] gonna be forever with our Lord
[47:16] so just here almost to finishing
[47:20] Matthew 6 said um late not up for
[47:24] yourself Treasures upon Earth this is
[47:27] our Lord Jesus Christ
[47:28] we're moth and rust does corrupt and
[47:31] where thieves break through and steal
[47:34] but lay up for yourself Treasures in
[47:36] Heaven where neither moth not
[47:39] rust death corrupt and where thieves do
[47:42] not break through nor still
[47:45] for where your treasure is they will
[47:48] your heart be also amen
[47:53] so for the last one

[47:56] rewards for overcoming because it's not
[47:59] only one there is many many rewards that
[48:02] we can get and I wanted to

[53:25] 32.
[53:28] and it says here
[53:30] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[53:32] shall call on the name of the Lord shall
[53:34] be delivered for in the Mount Zion and
[53:37] in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the
[53:39] Lord hath said and in the remnant whom
[53:41] the Lord shall call
[53:43] amen so anyway have your seats
[53:45] amen my title of the sum
[53:48] anism deliverance and it's just so this
[53:51] is just sort of tied in with my
[53:52] testimony but I'm going to move through
[53:54] it quite quick
[53:56] so just pay attention
[53:58] so
[54:00] I've been brought up in the message of
[54:02] my whole life I was also homeschooled we
[54:05] lived on a massive block with that
[54:06] backed onto dockland so the Lord has
[54:08] blessed me an ability to do heaps of pig
[54:10] hunting and brother matu actually got me
[54:12] into that thank goodness so that was the
[54:15] definitely the highlight of my teenage
[54:16] years
[54:17] I was and I was a young man at the age
[54:19] of 13 I was a young boy serving the lord
[54:22] so now I was really going strong and
[54:24] then yeah head catching his pigs
[54:26] um and I like to go to Genesis 37 verse
[54:28] three I'd like to just type my life to
[54:30] the life of Joseph then it's not exactly
[54:33] the same obviously but you're right you
[54:34] can get certain
[54:36] um similarities and and if you know
[54:37] every type of life with the peoples in
[54:39] the Bibles um now it says here now
[54:40] Israel loved Joseph more than all his
[54:42] children because he was the son of a
[54:44] sold age and he made him a coat of many
[54:46] colors so you know if things were going
[54:48] well for Joseph he was obviously the
[54:49] favorite Child you know and I was
[54:51] definitely you know I was definitely the
[54:53] the proud son of my dad and my dogs and
[54:56] stuff so you know we're quite some of it
[54:57] we're doing doing quite good
[54:59] um and brother Branham says here I've
[55:00] got a quote when he tried Bailon when he
[55:02] tried to kiss Israel he blessed Israel
[55:04] and black asked them why he said How can
[55:06] any Prophet say anything less God put it
[55:08] in his mouth see you can't say it
[55:10] there's no need amen so even the Devil
[55:13] Couldn't get to me at your nose and I
[55:14] was doing good but he did
[55:16] um
[55:18] at 14 I started going into the world I
[55:21] managed to get the access of the
[55:23] internet password without my parents
[55:25] from motion I started watching evil
[55:27] movies listening to ungodly songs begin
[55:28] watching pornography I started
[55:30] complaining about being homeschooled
[55:31] saying that I had no friends that I
[55:33] wasn't cool I started to despise my
[55:35] family as I didn't you know want to be
[55:37] around them in public because they had
[55:38] long hair and long dresses and stuff you
[55:40] know that grants us grants us the reward
[55:42] you know of it he didn't want one um and
[55:46] I became very embarrassed and no longer
[55:48] wanted to go to church pray or read my
[55:50] Bible and in Genesis 37 23 it says and
[55:53] it came to pass when Joseph was come
[55:55] unto his Brethren that they stripped
[55:57] Joseph out of his coat his coat of many
[55:59] colors that was on him and they took him
[56:02] and cast them into a pit and the pit was
[56:04] empty there was no water in it so if I
[56:07] could type Joseph's to mine it was like
[56:09] Joseph that has Brothers was carnal
[56:11] nature you know same with me my Cardinal
[56:13] nature sort of got a hold of me and I
[56:14] started you know doing all these things
[56:16] of the flesh that the flesh wants to
[56:17] like you know watch all these movies and
[56:19] all this stuff and these even movies and
[56:21] these ungodly songs I know the flesh
[56:22] desires it
[56:23] and you know so I got thrown into this
[56:25] pit
[56:26] um
[56:27] and then brother Brown says here there's
[56:29] been two dogs uh this was a the chief
[56:31] brother man speaking to achievement
[56:32] Chief says there's been two dogs and me
[56:34] and one of them is a black dog and one
[56:37] of them a white dog and said they argue
[56:38] all the time they growl and fight
[56:40] at one another and said the white dog
[56:43] wants me to do good the black dog wants
[56:45] me to do bad said well Chief which one
[56:47] of them wins the fight said that depends
[56:49] on which one she feeds the most and
[56:51] men's I was definitely not feeding the
[56:53] white dog and at 15 I started working
[56:56] full time in a flooring company that dad
[56:58] and brother Andy started
[56:59] I started smoking was some help of the
[57:02] dodgy workers that was there and then
[57:04] started to you know just roll my lungs
[57:05] so I was making piganding harder for me
[57:07] to do and and it started to enter my
[57:09] money so I was kind of running out of
[57:11] money um and then Genesis 37 28 then
[57:14] there passed by midianites merchantment
[57:16] and they drew and lifted up Joseph out
[57:18] of the pit and sold Joseph to the
[57:21] ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and
[57:23] they brought Joseph into Egypt so Joseph
[57:26] was really you know starting to run out
[57:27] of Hope
[57:28] you know and same with me you know I you
[57:31] know I was now addicted to something
[57:33] like completely adducted into this evil
[57:35] thing of smoking and this evilness and
[57:38] you know um
[57:39] and yeah at that point if I died I
[57:41] probably I would have been going
[57:42] directly to hell
[57:44] um
[57:46] but I like that thing you know um a
[57:48] pardon is only um a pardon if you're
[57:50] accepted as a part and say no church was
[57:52] all still here and everything but I
[57:53] didn't want to accept it I mean um the
[57:56] other man says and every man is
[57:57] deserving of how you're born and Sun
[57:59] shaped and iniquity come to the world
[58:00] speaking lies there's nothing good about
[58:03] us to begin with
[58:05] and then at 16 I got addicted to drugs I
[58:07] started hanging out with the wrong crowd
[58:09] I stopped going to church and I
[58:10] completely forgot about God
[58:12] um Genesis 37 36
[58:15] and the midianites sold him unto Egypt
[58:17] under potiphar and officer of pharaohs
[58:20] and captain of the Guard so now as the
[58:23] same with me Nino has Joseph's his
[58:25] family was gone he was an evil place
[58:27] with unbelievers and you know I was
[58:28] likewise you know I was all my family
[58:30] was gone wasn't hanging out with him
[58:31] anymore and I was surrounded by these
[58:33] unbelieving people who were the wrong
[58:35] crowd um and then at 17 all I wanted to
[58:38] do was join a gang I then met an Iraqi
[58:41] man who was getting patched up for the
[58:42] black power in three years when a
[58:44] patched up member got out of Princess
[58:45] like someone who's like in it for life
[58:47] and he's got his his pieces of Pride on
[58:49] that's really going to get him nowhere
[58:51] but anyways that's that's all that's all
[58:53] is that's you know that now what he
[58:54] lives for
[58:55] um I of course I could no longer stay at
[58:58] home I was forced to move out before I
[59:00] left dead told me as long as I didn't
[59:02] serve God nothing would go well for me
[59:03] and I would never fit inside you know
[59:06] nothing well for me I think I told about
[59:07] the story when I crashed the van
[59:09] that was no good and then but anyways I
[59:12] didn't feel that I was hanging out with
[59:13] like
[59:14] um these I reckons who were like you
[59:16] know the different culture so there was
[59:18] always the yeah
[59:19] but um different um and then
[59:24] um and then anyways I am
[59:28] I moved I then moved into a flat where
[59:30] there were more ungodly people so I
[59:31] became surrounded by all these ungodly
[59:34] people and then also I um there was one
[59:36] time that I was
[59:38] in full driving we went across the river
[59:40] and anyways our truck ended up getting
[59:42] washed out it was midnight and I was all
[59:44] on drugs and stuff and I ate all my you
[59:46] know big puffer jacket uncle's real cold
[59:47] shoes lace-up shoes and and then the
[59:50] truck sanked I quickly got out of the um
[59:53] the window of the truck before
[59:54] completely submerged and almost drowned
[59:56] because I couldn't get my puffer jacket
[59:57] off and I couldn't unlace my shoes so
[59:59] yeah and then but you know in my you
[1:00:02] know I was trying to call out for help
[1:00:03] at first you know asking everyone to
[1:00:04] come help me but no one came and then at
[1:00:07] the very end of it I started calling out
[1:00:08] to the Lord and the Lord answered no I
[1:00:10] lived so yeah but you know it's always
[1:00:12] in the yeah we want to praise the Lord
[1:00:13] and the good times and the bad times not
[1:00:14] just on the bad times
[1:00:16] um
[1:00:17] and Genesis 39 20 and Joseph's Master
[1:00:21] took him and put him in prison a place
[1:00:22] where the Kings prisoners were bound and
[1:00:24] he was there in prison but the law was
[1:00:26] with Joseph and showed him mercy and
[1:00:29] favor and the sight of The Keeper of the
[1:00:30] prison so it was like me you know even
[1:00:32] though you know I I was literally like
[1:00:35] imprisoned with you know the scan I
[1:00:36] couldn't relieve and stuff and then but
[1:00:38] still with all their Mercy you know I
[1:00:39] didn't die and stuff like that
[1:00:41] um and then
[1:00:43] brother Branham said here and yet he
[1:00:46] loved me so that he came down and saved
[1:00:48] me by his grace nothing I deserved or
[1:00:50] could do but he saved me because before
[1:00:52] the foundation of the world was he
[1:00:54] predestinated me to be saved amen so the
[1:00:57] Lord the Lord you know after that the
[1:00:59] Lord sort of almost started to work and
[1:01:01] I I got kicked out of my place in Gelson
[1:01:03] and then I got put into this motel and
[1:01:06] um had an awful awful time in the eye
[1:01:08] actually got a little green card and
[1:01:09] that's you can only buy food with that
[1:01:11] it was very very limited and anyways
[1:01:13] before the lockdown hit I I could buy
[1:01:15] food and a little bit of drugs for that
[1:01:17] and for that I lost the green card and
[1:01:19] then lockdown had all the food prices
[1:01:20] went real high so I I was like I won't
[1:01:23] give eye drugs or give up the food so I
[1:01:25] basically stopped eating so I got real
[1:01:27] hungry and it was awful and all I could
[1:01:29] watch was shortland Street worst TV show
[1:01:31] ever
[1:01:32] ever
[1:01:34] um
[1:01:35] I mean
[1:01:40] that might be in hell now it probably
[1:01:42] won't but hey it's gonna be something
[1:01:43] like that
[1:01:44] um
[1:01:45] and then anyway so I I think I'm dead I
[1:01:48] was like hey dude can I please move back
[1:01:49] home you know I can't I'm not really
[1:01:51] doing too good here can't eat anything
[1:01:53] um and then I um yeah I moved back moved
[1:01:56] back and with dad started working for
[1:01:58] him again and and my 18th birthday I
[1:02:01] know my worldly friends I have all these
[1:02:02] big people that beat up each other they
[1:02:05] must have thought I was a bit weak so
[1:02:06] none of them like me and then at my 18th
[1:02:08] birthday none of them were there so I
[1:02:09] spend a year with these guys and they're
[1:02:11] all gone and all that was there was um
[1:02:13] my family you know Ben Bailey
[1:02:15] um but you know I was still you know
[1:02:18] still um and then
[1:02:20] yeah I really wanted wanted uh to you
[1:02:23] know wanted us to seek the Lord and
[1:02:25] obviously go to heaven and stuff and
[1:02:27] then that down mom painted the painting
[1:02:29] ages ago and it had like a headwind dead
[1:02:32] and we were looking which was showing
[1:02:33] the back of us and we're looking across
[1:02:35] an ocean toward the sunrise and we're
[1:02:38] staying on a beach and um anyways I
[1:02:40] could I've never seen it for my life but
[1:02:41] when at this moment I seen it there was
[1:02:43] like a breach between me and my dad I
[1:02:44] was like well you know Dad's going
[1:02:46] heaven and I'm going hell and that
[1:02:47] really scared me um and then we went to
[1:02:49] the I'll uh we had to go to the otaki
[1:02:52] camp the Family Camp and um
[1:02:55] [Music]
[1:02:57] they were going to kick me out of the
[1:02:58] house for four days and lock me outside
[1:03:00] so I thought oh I'll come
[1:03:02] um and I I got really blessed there just
[1:03:04] there was an absolutely awesome awesome
[1:03:06] time I mean make sure your kids go to
[1:03:08] those camps
[1:03:10] yeah
[1:03:11] um Genesis 43 29 and he lifted up his
[1:03:14] eyes and saws by the Benjamin his
[1:03:16] mother's son and said is this your
[1:03:18] younger brother of whom you spake unto
[1:03:20] them and he said God be gracious to thee
[1:03:23] and Joseph made haste and his bowels the
[1:03:26] Dune upon his brother amen so I was the
[1:03:28] same with me you know Joseph you know I
[1:03:30] came back and something was different
[1:03:32] about my family truly truly different
[1:03:34] um and same with Joseph you know there
[1:03:36] was obviously a new person they'd never
[1:03:37] met before in his family when he saw he
[1:03:38] saw them again so you know and he was
[1:03:40] quite sad and I was also quite sad you
[1:03:42] know because I didn't want to yeah I
[1:03:44] wanted to you know go go see the Lord
[1:03:45] and Glory not burning hell um
[1:03:48] I mean um
[1:03:50] brother Branson is here he loves us
[1:03:52] before we loved him he loves us as I've
[1:03:56] said no man seeks after God God seeks
[1:03:58] after man so then the Lord started to
[1:04:00] seek after me after that camp and after
[1:04:02] I was really blessed and then I was I
[1:04:04] think I told you guys before but I was
[1:04:05] in the van and I got I got filled with
[1:04:07] the Holy Ghost while I was listening to
[1:04:08] Amazing Grace
[1:04:09] I mean and then after that the Lord
[1:04:12] helped me quit all the evil addictions
[1:04:14] or all the evilness that I was doing
[1:04:17] and then not long ago I was actually in
[1:04:20] at brother Andy's place in the in his
[1:04:22] little room downstairs and I had a
[1:04:23] vision and the Lord told me to go to
[1:04:25] Indonesia so I believe that's my calling
[1:04:27] I want to go over there and build some
[1:04:28] Churches amen so yeah we serve a great
[1:04:32] God and and so I hope you're truly
[1:04:34] blessed I'm gonna hand it back over to
