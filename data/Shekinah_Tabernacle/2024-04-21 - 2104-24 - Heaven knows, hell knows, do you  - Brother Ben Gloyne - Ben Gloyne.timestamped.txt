[5:42] praise the Lord hello welcome to church
[5:44] this
[5:45] morning amen it's good to be here it's
[5:47] good to see all of you see your smiling
[5:51] faces
[5:54] amen I
[5:56] I so we had I I just you know when you
[5:59] get up here you just talk a bit to kind
[6:01] of capture the atmosphere and like see
[6:04] how people are doing and it's like you
[6:06] got to warm up you know when you when
[6:08] you in the winter when you apparently
[6:10] with a diesel you kind of diesel vehicle
[6:12] you've got to just sort of switch it on
[6:14] and leave it running for like five or 10
[6:15] minutes before you drive the thing you
[6:17] know cuz it's got to all sort of warm up
[6:19] so we're just going to you know if you
[6:21] wonder why I come up here and just start
[6:23] talking a bit and just kind
[6:24] [Music]
[6:25] of sometimes blabber on it's like it's
[6:28] actually very spiritual
[6:30] [Laughter]
[6:36] so
[6:37] um
[6:39] yeah yeah yeah yeah so so no so we had
[6:43] the we had the communion on Wednesday
[6:46] was who was here on
[6:48] Wednesday and um I was sitting down I
[6:51] was thinking you know I always dragg the
[6:53] children up with me to do communion and
[6:54] things I said uh I said to the children
[6:57] you know what you guys go out by
[6:58] yourself you know this is more a
[6:59] personal thing you you got just I
[7:03] thought that not that I'm right or wrong
[7:04] or anything I just thought you guys you
[7:05] always come up with me but you know when
[7:07] you when you serve the Lord you got to
[7:09] it's you and the Lord you know it's
[7:10] between you and God you go you you
[7:12] that's just something I thought I was
[7:14] like so you just got by yourself I'm
[7:15] just going to go up when I want to go up
[7:18] but little did I realize I was breaking
[7:19] tradition
[7:22] man you know cuz like we have a very
[7:25] nice tradition here where we you know we
[7:27] all got with the family you know so the
[7:29] father and the mother and all the
[7:30] children and toe come up and then you
[7:32] know it's a very nice tradition it's and
[7:35] I I like it but you know it's a it's a
[7:39] it is a tradition if you if you'd be
[7:40] honest about it you know cuz the Bible
[7:42] says that every man you know examine
[7:45] himself and you know it's it's your own
[7:47] personal thing it's not like oh how I'll
[7:49] examine you child you know how you're
[7:50] doing it's like no you got to go and
[7:52] meet God yourself you're the one you die
[7:54] tonight you it's you and the Lord I'm
[7:56] not there to help you you the Lord's
[7:58] crossing over with you my faith can help
[8:00] you but that's as far as my ability to
[8:03] help you goes is my faith you know and I
[8:06] know there's a bit more to it but yeah
[8:08] so we were driving home and the children
[8:10] were
[8:10] like cuz I came up by myself and then
[8:13] there was a straggling of others and the
[8:14] the children were like Dad you shouldn't
[8:16] have done that they're all going to
[8:17] think we're having a big dispute in the
[8:18] family and you're going up by yourself
[8:24] and so you know it goes to show the
[8:27] power of tradition sometimes you know oh
[8:30] and and I I thought you know some of the
[8:32] people that had to even follow Jesus
[8:33] they had to really break with some
[8:35] tradition and some very powerful ways
[8:38] that families did things in that and
[8:39] someone in the family had to say no um
[8:42] uh I won't be at the synagogue today I'm
[8:43] actually going out in the field to
[8:44] listen to this other
[8:46] man and it was
[8:48] a they were they had to fight against
[8:51] this well no that's not who's this guy
[8:53] we do this this is the way we've always
[8:54] done it what are you doing who's this
[8:56] you know so but I thank God that you
[8:58] know we yeah we don't do things here out
[9:01] of a tradition we do things out of a
[9:03] love for God and we we follow the lord
[9:04] the way that the Lord calls us to do it
[9:07] so I don't know why I said that but I
[9:08] was just how are you all doing you're
[9:11] doing good good okay let's stand and

[40:37] Psalms 119 and vers 89 down to 93
[40:43] here halfway through school
[40:46] holidays 50% there the older ones are
[40:51] rejoicing the younger ones are lamenting
[40:53] but hey we'll get through it amen some
[40:57] 1989 you can take that however you want
[41:00] to I don't
[41:02] know any who so this is uh say it says
[41:05] here forever O Lord Thy word is settled
[41:08] in heaven thy faithfulness is unto all
[41:10] generations thou Hast established the
[41:12] Earth and it abideth they continue this
[41:15] day according to thine ordinances for
[41:17] all are thy servants unless thy law had
[41:20] been my Delights I should have perished
[41:22] in mine Affliction I will never forget
[41:24] thy precepts for with them thou Hast
[41:27] quickened me glory to God Amen um let's
[41:31] just Bowe in a word of prayer this
[41:32] morning amen if you have a need just
[41:35] want to slip your hand before the Lord
[41:37] amen gracious Lord we're so thankful
[41:39] that we can come into your presence that
[41:41] we don't worship an idea Lord or a
[41:43] religion we worship the true and living
[41:45] God the Lord Jesus Christ and we are
[41:48] asking dear God you come down in our
[41:49] midst in a very special way may you
[41:51] touch all of our hearts may you speak to
[41:54] our lives Lord God we need you to pour
[41:56] yourself into us more and more and we
[41:59] are just so thankful you have quickened
[42:01] us by Your Word Lord we are so thankful
[42:04] Lord just want to pray dear God for all
[42:05] those who couldn't be here today we
[42:07] think of Sister Barbara dear God and
[42:08] others who are not well I pray father
[42:10] Bailey family Lord I just ask that you
[42:12] would be everyone's portion Lord if they
[42:14] be streaming May you may your presence
[42:16] be with them because you said to us all
[42:19] you'd never leave us nor forsake us no
[42:20] matter where we are may you be their
[42:22] portion and Lord may you just have
[42:24] preeminence in the service we surrender
[42:26] Our Lives into hands may your blood
[42:28] cover us all oh God and may you have the
[42:30] preeminence For Your Glory in Jesus
[42:32] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[42:34] friends you may have your seats this
[42:36] morning so I have this thought um and
[42:39] it's Heaven Knows hell knows do you
[42:43] Hallelujah that's the question so Heaven
[42:45] Knows hell knows do you amen cuz that's
[42:48] really the thing if you know like heaven
[42:50] knows and hell knows Hallelujah you're
[42:53] going to have a glorious walk amen so we
[42:55] read here in Psalms 10 19 here that you
[42:58] know the word of God is settled uh in
[43:01] heaven I mean forever so it's done in
[43:04] God's mind his word is true it works in
[43:06] every circumstance in every situation it
[43:09] works there's not a variable there's no
[43:11] there's no sub Clauses or variables
[43:14] where God says it cannot work it can
[43:15] work in to all places all generations
[43:18] all situations God word is true it's all
[43:20] powerful you know it can do what it
[43:22] wants to do amen so we got to realize
[43:24] that God knows this amen God knows
[43:27] because he is his word God knows his
[43:29] word Works amen cuz he said let there be
[43:31] sun moon and stars and you go out at
[43:33] night maybe you can see one star because
[43:35] of the street lights maybe you can see
[43:36] the whole whole milky white way I don't
[43:38] know but God said let there be and it's
[43:40] amazing in the book of gener um Genesis
[43:42] it says and he made this Heaven um um
[43:45] heavens and you know Heavens also just
[43:47] like a side note like God made all the
[43:49] creation he said oh and I made that too
[43:51] by the way you know so God can do
[43:53] anything his word is all powerful now
[43:55] we're going to realize that the devil
[43:57] doesn't have the keys to his own house
[43:58] this morning he's defeated you know he
[44:00] knows what happened that day on Calvary
[44:02] he felt the impact of it you know one
[44:04] event can cause some people to Rejoice
[44:07] the same event can cause other people to
[44:08] mourn like you know when the All Blacks
[44:10] lose another world cup it makes our GDP
[44:12] go down domestic violence go up trouble
[44:14] happens but the other team's rejoicing
[44:16] saying we won so the same event can
[44:19] cause rioting or it can cause rejoicing
[44:22] it depends what side you're on Amen so I
[44:24] don't believe we're on Hell's side today
[44:26] I believe we on side today amen so hell
[44:29] knows that it doesn't have Satan
[44:31] remembered the moment where the Lord
[44:33] Jesus stepped into hell he remembered
[44:35] the moment that feeling he got that
[44:36] finally I've got you you know he said to
[44:38] the Lord Jesus I thought I had you when
[44:40] I had Abel I thought I had you when I
[44:42] had Noah I thought I had you when I had
[44:43] Moses I thought I had you when I had
[44:45] John the Baptist but finally you're here
[44:47] and maybe he just was gloating and think
[44:49] oh he's going to enjoy this but really
[44:50] the one who was going to enjoy it was
[44:52] the Lord Jesus amen because Jesus said
[44:54] no Satan my blood's on the cross amen I
[44:57] have redeemed Adam's Fallen race I have
[44:59] redeemed this Earth I'm in charge I'm
[45:01] the boss now give me the keys I H death
[45:03] in the grave he boots Satan back down to
[45:05] how he slams the door behind him and
[45:06] walks up triumphant amen so Satan knows
[45:09] the day he lost his keys and he's not
[45:11] guessing where he lost him he knows we
[45:14] lose our keys we got to kind of go down
[45:16] a memory lane and try and find them and
[45:17] eventually hopefully we do he doesn't
[45:20] Satan doesn't need to try and remember
[45:21] he knows because that moment so impacted
[45:24] his life he's never the same death is
[45:26] never the same hell's never been the
[45:28] same amen and so hell knows
[45:31] it Heaven Knows It Hallelujah do you
[45:34] hallelujah hallelujah you know it says
[45:37] here in Revelations 12 and there was war
[45:39] in heaven Michael and his angels fought
[45:41] against the dragon and the Dragon for
[45:43] and his angels and prevailed not hell
[45:45] knows this I I'm just going to go
[45:47] through some things today because
[45:49] because it's when we don't know like
[45:51] heaven knows then fear comes in we try
[45:54] to operate in a humanistic realm and
[45:56] that's where trouble comes but if we can
[45:58] receive revelation we can know like God
[46:00] knows amen that his word is true his
[46:03] word is powerful he's more than enough
[46:04] and every trial we'll stand on his word
[46:07] we won't try and use our five senses to
[46:09] work things out we won't try and you
[46:10] know work things out with our mind see
[46:12] the world is trying to work out how to
[46:14] fix the world oh my that's going really
[46:17] well isn't it that's working out real
[46:20] good for them this place is going to be
[46:22] smoke bombs and craters and Chaos cuz
[46:25] they're trying to work out how it's
[46:26] going to go humanistically see but if
[46:28] they could just see into the word of God
[46:30] how things should be handled oh boy
[46:32] won't be no trouble you know I heard
[46:34] brother Bram this morning saying you
[46:36] know a holy ghost filled camp meeting is
[46:39] more has more power for a nation than
[46:42] all the atomic bombs that Nation can
[46:44] make for million years amen that's what
[46:46] he said amen so the so the anointed of
[46:49] God being in a country amen can do more
[46:51] for that country amen than than all the
[46:53] weapons that that anyone could ever
[46:55] devise I say an anointed son of of God
[46:57] in a family I mean can do more for that
[46:59] family than all the counseling all the
[47:01] self out books all the humanistic things
[47:03] am mean the anointing of God in that
[47:05] family will do far more than anything
[47:07] else you see so now so the devil fought
[47:11] and he lost and he prevailed not neither
[47:13] was there any uh their place found
[47:15] anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon
[47:17] was cast out that old serpent called the
[47:19] devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[47:21] whole world he was cast out into the
[47:23] Earth and his angels were cast out with
[47:25] him amen and I heard a loud voice saying
[47:28] in heaven now has come salvation and
[47:30] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[47:32] the power of His Christ isn't it isn't
[47:34] it strange the devil's cast out into the
[47:37] Earth but now here comes this voice
[47:38] saying now has come power to the people
[47:41] of God hallelujah because when the enemy
[47:43] comes in like a flood the Lord says I'll
[47:45] raise up a standard he'll make his
[47:46] promises more alive more real more
[47:48] tangible amen praise the Lord amen so
[47:52] for the accuser of our Brethren is cast
[47:54] down which accused them before our God
[47:56] day and night and they overcame him this
[47:58] is where you step in and they overcame
[48:00] him by the blood of the lamb and the
[48:02] word of their testimony and they love
[48:04] that not their lives un the death amen
[48:06] this is what heaven knows but do you
[48:08] know it this is how you overcome by the
[48:10] blood of the lamb and the word of your
[48:13] testimony what should your testimony be
[48:15] God's word is true I believe the word
[48:18] amen irrespective of how I'm feeling
[48:20] what I'm going through the Mind battles
[48:22] the troubles whatever no God's word I'm
[48:25] going to confess God's word not going to
[48:27] confess my situation I'm not going to uh
[48:29] no I'm not denying my situation right
[48:31] we're not ostriches that have ostrich
[48:33] faith and just put their head in the
[48:34] sand right we're not those kind of a
[48:36] people we see the enemy for what he is
[48:38] and what he does like brother Bram says
[48:40] and how can I overcome he says you know
[48:42] it's like you've got cancer you really
[48:44] have cancer you can't deny it you've got
[48:46] it but greater is he that's in you
[48:48] that's already conquered that cancer
[48:50] than that cancer right so that's how you
[48:51] overcome you don't put blinkers on you
[48:53] don't deny things and walk around like
[48:55] this you say yes the enemy is there but
[48:57] my God is greater than that enemy I
[48:59] don't need to fear him because my God
[49:01] has already overcome this enemy
[49:04] hallelujah hallelujah amenu therefore
[49:07] Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in
[49:09] them woe to the inhabitants of the earth
[49:10] and of the sea for the devil has come
[49:12] down unto having great wrath he doesn't
[49:16] have great
[49:17] joy he's
[49:19] angry he's got great wrath he's got
[49:21] great hatred great great anger because
[49:24] he knoweth he has but a short time
[49:27] so heaven knows that the expired date of
[49:31] the devil is now Satan knows it himself
[49:34] he sees his barcode he sees the expiry
[49:36] date he he's come to his end see you
[49:39] could think now he's come down he's God
[49:41] of this evil age you think he'd have
[49:42] great joy now I'm a now I'm King no he's
[49:45] has great wrath because he knows the one
[49:47] that kicked him out of Heaven pursued
[49:49] him down upon the Earth amen so so
[49:52] heaven so Satan knows he lost in heaven
[49:55] he's going to lose on the Earth right
[49:57] heaven knows that Satan lost in heaven
[49:59] he's going to lose upon the Earth but
[50:01] what about you now when this battle
[50:02] falls on human beings now falls on you
[50:05] and I do we know what side we're on do
[50:07] we know the power of the side we're on
[50:09] Amen so the devil has great wrath amen
[50:12] he is angry he is troubled amen now as I
[50:15] said before you know one event can can
[50:18] can cause people to react different ways
[50:20] see thou believest there is one God thou
[50:22] doest well the Devils also believe and
[50:26] TR
[50:27] they're troubled this all powerful being
[50:30] the supreme god they believe in him too
[50:32] but it doesn't give them Joy it doesn't
[50:34] give them love it doesn't give them
[50:36] peace it doesn't give them satisfaction
[50:38] it doesn't give them Comfort no it makes
[50:40] them tremble it makes them afraid amen
[50:42] because they know this great one that
[50:44] conquered them in heaven is going to
[50:45] conquer them on the earth amen and
[50:47] because our lord Jesus has already
[50:49] conquered hell death in the grave amen
[50:51] this is just you know this is just they
[50:53] know it's coming the devil knows he's
[50:55] got it coming to him yes amen we know
[50:58] we've got Glory coming to us amen
[51:01] hallelujah so it's so important that we
[51:03] that we realize you know that we think
[51:06] and know like heaven knows remember if
[51:09] the devil was uh you know spoke the
[51:11] truth and nothing but the truth he' say
[51:14] yeah I'm going to lose he reads the same
[51:17] script you do he reads the same script
[51:20] he reads the end of the book He studies
[51:22] it he's trying to find a loophole trying
[51:24] to find a way in and he's tried every
[51:26] loophole he can to try and get into the
[51:28] bride of Christ but he can't get in I
[51:30] mean because the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:31] has sealed him out I mean the anointing
[51:33] of God has sealed him out amen so he's
[51:35] trying to find a loophole but he just
[51:36] can't get it he searches and he tries
[51:39] he's got all these schemes and all these
[51:40] things so he thinks in his in his
[51:42] deluded mind somehow he can win but if
[51:44] he was truthful he' say no I can't win
[51:47] right you know Hitler had great
[51:49] delusions of grandure uh when when when
[51:52] when the when the Soviets were coming
[51:54] and you know the Americans and the
[51:55] allies landed in Normandy you know he
[51:59] had plans to rebuild Berlin he had these
[52:01] big models built of this great big
[52:03] Metropolis he was going to build he had
[52:04] this delusions of grandeur we're going
[52:06] to win this thing we're going to turn
[52:08] this thing around his generals knew they
[52:11] knew if the Allies ever got a beach hit
[52:13] in Normandy that was the war that's it
[52:16] but they fought like they were going to
[52:17] win the Nazis but they knew they were
[52:18] going to lose the devil know he's got
[52:20] delusions of grandeur I'm going to have
[52:22] a I'm going to have an eternal Kingdom
[52:23] I'm going to build my my kingdom I'm
[52:26] going to be like the most high and all
[52:27] these things I'm going to have a you
[52:29] know Kingdom better than God's kingdom
[52:31] he's got all these models set out but
[52:33] yet if his generals really told him the
[52:35] truth and he really realized the truth
[52:37] he no no we've lost this
[52:41] thing we've lost this thing you know but
[52:44] you see the devil never go he doesn't
[52:45] have Revelation he has calculations and
[52:48] thoughts and ideas and planning it but
[52:50] he doesn't have Revelation because if
[52:52] you really walk like God walked you know
[52:55] the end from the beginning
[52:57] amen and God wants us to walk like that
[52:59] in this world he wants us to walk by
[53:01] Revelation not by humanistic ideas not
[53:04] not by calculations and projections of
[53:06] this is how I think this will happen and
[53:08] this and this no you got to walk by
[53:10] Revelation amen because if you walk by
[53:12] Revelation that's the only thing that
[53:14] has prevailing power against the enemy
[53:16] it's not us in our two Ines of gray
[53:18] matter trying to work out how to beat
[53:20] them and how to defeat him because even
[53:21] the Christian world today they think we
[53:23] have to somehow outsmart the devil to
[53:25] not take the Ark of the Beast and go in
[53:27] rapture we don't have to outsmart the
[53:29] devil our lord Jesus already conquered
[53:31] him we surrender to the word of God and
[53:33] God gets us there amen this is not
[53:36] something where you know like an escape
[53:38] room or something you got to try and you
[53:40] know work it out and how can I escape
[53:42] this scenario no surrender to the Lord
[53:45] Jesus and he'll get you out of the
[53:47] scenario amen but you see the devil
[53:49] wants us to think like him yeah that's
[53:51] right that's what he wants us to do he
[53:53] wants us to uh because he he knows the
[53:56] power of Revelation he's he's felt the
[53:59] effects of it Jesus said no man takes my
[54:02] life I lay it down and I'll pick it back
[54:04] up again he heard those words he saw it
[54:07] happen yeah Glory he Jesus said I am the
[54:11] resurrection and the life you know and
[54:13] and the devil anointed all the you know
[54:15] the mourners to go with Mary and Martha
[54:17] try and put some unbelief into their
[54:18] house and try and keep the promise
[54:19] coming but Jesus came their way anyway
[54:22] called them out amen where where Martha
[54:24] went to Mary said the master call your
[54:26] comes and cth for thee took her out that
[54:29] you unbelieving atmosphere of your know
[54:31] this your pity parties and all these
[54:33] things took took her out of that and
[54:35] then Jesus spoke to her faith came back
[54:37] yes Lord you can do it right now amen
[54:40] where'd you lay him Hallelujah went to
[54:42] the Grave Jesus wept because humanly he
[54:44] was he was hurting cuz his friends were
[54:46] hurting amen cuz you when he wept he was
[54:48] a man but when he said Lazarus come
[54:50] forth amen if he didn't speak Lazarus by
[54:52] name there would have been a general
[54:53] Resurrection Hallelujah why cuz he's the
[54:55] resurrection in the life amen hallelujah
[54:58] so so the devil has felt the effects of
[55:02] Revelation amen he felt the effects in
[55:04] the prophets meetings where where where
[55:06] God gave him Revelation in the cave by
[55:08] the angel of the Lord amen if you get
[55:09] the people to believe nothing will stand
[55:12] before your prayers not even
[55:14] cancer and night after night meeting
[55:17] after meeting demons were cast out
[55:19] demons ran for the hills I think it was
[55:21] Billy Andrews um um who who became a
[55:24] Believer but but he was an evangelist
[55:25] and brother time and you know he could
[55:27] see demons in meetings and he was up on
[55:30] the balcony first meeting he ever went
[55:31] to and you know um you know he's just
[55:35] watching the service and and he saw
[55:37] brother BR come in the side they on the
[55:38] platform not even say a word just come
[55:40] and take off his hat and he said demon
[55:42] started running for the hills amen he
[55:45] saw that he saw man this is this is
[55:47] different see because the devil believes
[55:50] and trembles he is he has felt the
[55:52] impact of Calvary he felt the impact of
[55:55] Pentecost amen you know the bride feels
[55:58] the impact of Pentecost too it puts our
[56:00] dancing shoes on because we realize we'
[56:01] passed from Death to life amen nothing
[56:03] can harm us amen because we have eternal
[56:05] life but on the flip side of that amen
[56:08] because remember before Pentecost you
[56:10] know Peter tried to scheme in his mind
[56:13] how can I stay close and how can I do
[56:15] this and you know but then a woman came
[56:17] to him you know when he's warming
[56:18] himself in the fire aren't you one of
[56:20] them and then another one came and then
[56:22] a man came all these things and that
[56:24] pressure broke him where he became a a a
[56:27] god denying cursing preacher curing
[56:30] preacher right swearing and all those
[56:32] things but after Pentecost greater far
[56:35] greater pressure Came Upon the disciples
[56:37] cuz there wasn't some people by a fire
[56:39] outside the Judgment Hall they were in
[56:41] the Judgment Hall standing before the
[56:42] same ones that Jesus did and Peter said
[56:45] well what should we do should we serve
[56:46] God or man oh boy basically we're not
[56:48] backing up we're not quitting you can't
[56:50] make us we're going to keep walking on
[56:52] with God yes and so the devil realized
[56:55] I've got a problem yeah Hallelujah I've
[56:57] got a real problem here hallelujah are
[57:00] you following where I'm you because why
[57:01] he was now walking by Revelation he
[57:04] wasn't walking by humanistic fear and
[57:06] worry and all these things he was
[57:08] walking by Revelation amen so
[57:11] now I just going to read this from the
[57:13] church age book now remember this Christ
[57:15] in the true in the true church is a
[57:17] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[57:19] Book of Revelation shows how the
[57:21] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[57:22] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[57:24] formal and Powerless it exposes Satan
[57:27] revealing his works is which is the
[57:29] attempted destruction of God's people
[57:31] and the discrediting of God's word right
[57:33] down to the time he's cast into the Lake
[57:35] of Fire he fights that he cannot stand
[57:37] it he knows that if the people get the
[57:40] true revelation of the true church and
[57:42] what she is and what she stands for and
[57:45] that she can do the Greater Works she
[57:47] will be an invincible army yes sir what
[57:51] are we we're bone of his bone flesh
[57:54] flesh of his flesh life of his life
[57:57] we're part of the Lord Jesus we are
[57:59] united with him amen what do we stand
[58:01] for this word is true amen God is always
[58:05] right in every situation God is always
[58:07] right no matter what's going on in my
[58:09] life he's right amen I may be I may be
[58:12] the tale I may be going through all kind
[58:13] of trouble but he is right he knows what
[58:16] he's doing I have full confidence in him
[58:19] amen hallelujah someone someone join in
[58:21] for a second amen doesn't matter what's
[58:23] happening in life you say I'm going
[58:24] through a the ringer God knows what he's
[58:26] doing God wants to prove himself he
[58:28] wants to manifest himself he wants you
[58:31] to trust him in the storm now I made
[58:33] completely butcher this dream that you
[58:35] know Christine had the other day but I
[58:36] think it's a real good one you know she
[58:38] was she was here in the harbor and there
[58:40] was a you know the harbor was Cal but
[58:41] out in the cook TR was big massive Seas
[58:43] there was a fairy went out there and
[58:44] that's you know the waves are swamping
[58:46] it and all these things and now she's
[58:47] not a water person me I love the
[58:51] sea many times sailing there as a young
[58:54] boy you know you can't even see the the
[58:56] shore because the swell was so high
[58:57] above the master of your boat I was
[58:59] having a great time the boat would you
[59:01] know pitch pole over and spit you out
[59:03] you had to swim after it try and catch
[59:04] it so it didn't know I was loving it
[59:07] that's me she's the opposite of that
[59:08] kind of deal hey but but the thing is
[59:10] the Lord told her I want you to go out
[59:12] there I want you to get into this little
[59:13] boat and I want you to go out there and
[59:15] she's like well Lord I don't want to go
[59:16] out there but if you want me to go out
[59:18] there I'll go out there and then so she
[59:20] went out there and as she was going into
[59:22] this big storm it was calm all around
[59:25] where she was but the storm was still
[59:27] raging yeah why cuz Jesus was in the
[59:29] boat too so the thing is right God wants
[59:32] you actually to go into a storm
[59:33] sometimes he doesn't want you to stay in
[59:35] a nest he wants you to fly he wants you
[59:38] to be like him he wants you to see what
[59:40] you're made of and you're not going to
[59:42] see that by sitting in a sheltered
[59:44] little bubble where where you have no
[59:46] harm no trouble he wants you to step
[59:49] into it amen so she went into the storm
[59:51] that the is being washed and covered and
[59:54] Things by waves and she's just just in
[59:56] this little calm patch as the storm goes
[59:58] on around
[59:59] her but do you trust them to go into the
[1:00:01] storm Hallelujah see she said Lord I
[1:00:03] trust you I'll go out there I don't want
[1:00:05] to but I'll go out there CU I trust you
[1:00:07] see and it's if we can trust him in
[1:00:09] every situation you've got Victory am no
[1:00:13] matter sickness sorrow pain hard
[1:00:15] whatever the storm is if you can trust
[1:00:17] him in that storm you've already won
[1:00:20] amen hallelujah amen she can do the
[1:00:23] greater work she'll be an invincible
[1:00:25] Army if they get a true revelation of
[1:00:27] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:00:29] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:00:31] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:00:33] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:00:36] her he will be definely thred today as
[1:00:38] when Christ withstood his every effort
[1:00:40] to gain power over him in the desert yes
[1:00:43] Satan hates Revelation but we love it do
[1:00:45] you love it when the Lord Reveals His
[1:00:47] word to your heart I mean not to your
[1:00:49] top two inches only but but into your
[1:00:51] heart amen you love that amen with true
[1:00:53] Revelation Our Lives the gates of hell
[1:00:55] canot Prevail against us but we will
[1:00:58] prevail over them amen so gate stops
[1:01:02] access we know that so any that tries to
[1:01:04] stop you to get to the blessings of God
[1:01:05] you're going to Prevail over there am me
[1:01:07] you take the battering realm of his word
[1:01:09] say God you said This Promise is mine
[1:01:11] I'm coming through the devil I'm coming
[1:01:13] through amen you may feel discouraged
[1:01:16] bang through the that door of
[1:01:17] discouragement you may feel weary
[1:01:19] trouble that's a door trying to stop you
[1:01:21] that's a gate trying to stop you amen
[1:01:23] you say no Satan I'm not I'm not staying
[1:01:25] on this side I'm going
[1:01:27] in amen cuz we got to realize we're in
[1:01:30] line for a breakthrough hallelujah we're
[1:01:32] in line for a breakthrough we're
[1:01:33] actually sit up for a breakthrough like
[1:01:35] blind bmus he was there in Jericho he
[1:01:37] was lined up for a breakthrough why cuz
[1:01:39] Jesus came his way he cried out by faith
[1:01:42] amen and he got healed amen he had a
[1:01:44] breakthrough in his life Hallelujah you
[1:01:46] can take zakus any they lined their
[1:01:48] lives were lined up for a breakthrough
[1:01:50] amen amen see it is the authority it is
[1:01:53] the revelation of God that gives us
[1:01:55] authority over the devil why is that
[1:01:58] because we think like God thinks God
[1:02:00] knows he has authority Jesus did not ask
[1:02:03] one time Mr devil can you please leave
[1:02:05] this is not convenient right now he said
[1:02:07] no go Legion leave well can I go to the
[1:02:12] onean okay I'll give you permission to
[1:02:13] do that you know
[1:02:16] so that's how the Lord knows he knows he
[1:02:18] has Authority but do you know cuz the
[1:02:21] devil wants you to wants you to think
[1:02:23] that you have no power with God like
[1:02:25] brother one time he woke up in the
[1:02:27] morning the devil was in the corner of
[1:02:28] his room cackling like a chicken saying
[1:02:30] you have no power over me you've got no
[1:02:32] power with God Satan and and brother
[1:02:34] Bram said just get out in the name of
[1:02:35] Jesus Christ and the thing left but the
[1:02:37] enemy is trying to intimidate him you
[1:02:39] think you've got power you think you're
[1:02:41] Victorious you think the blood's more
[1:02:43] than enough no you've got no power with
[1:02:45] me that's what he does he tell you that
[1:02:48] you've got to call him at his bluff say
[1:02:49] Satan you're lying he's not going to
[1:02:52] tell you you can cast me out now yes
[1:02:54] I've lost no he fights like he's winning
[1:02:57] he's he's he fights like he's going to
[1:02:59] win and some many times we fight like
[1:03:01] we're going to lose I think we should
[1:03:03] walk and fight like we've won because
[1:03:05] that's how because Jesus said it's
[1:03:07] finished right when he died on Calvary
[1:03:08] it's finished it's done am that's in his
[1:03:11] mind is that in your mind is that in
[1:03:13] your heart that's how heaven knows it
[1:03:15] that's how Satan knows it but do you
[1:03:17] know it the same way Jesus amen you see
[1:03:21] but the thing is if we let's just read a
[1:03:23] few more I like this we having the same
[1:03:25] Spirit of faith according as it as it is
[1:03:27] written I believed and therefore have I
[1:03:30] spoken we also believe and therefore
[1:03:32] speak amen knowing that he which raised
[1:03:34] up the Lord Jesus shall raise us also by
[1:03:37] Jesus and shall present us with you for
[1:03:40] all things are for your sakes that the
[1:03:41] abundant grace might through the
[1:03:43] Thanksgiving of many rebound to the
[1:03:45] glory of God for which cause we faint
[1:03:48] not but though our outward man perish
[1:03:51] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:03:53] for our light Affliction amen I like it
[1:03:56] how the Apostle Paul would just classify
[1:03:58] every trial that would ever come across
[1:04:00] any person any time that's a light
[1:04:01] Affliction let's just put this in the
[1:04:03] right category okay but then also which
[1:04:06] is but for a
[1:04:09] moment oh that seems like a long moment
[1:04:11] but you know I remember like waking up
[1:04:14] Christmas morning it was a long morning
[1:04:16] but then it was but then it f it felt
[1:04:18] long but really it was a same length as
[1:04:20] any other morning but it felt long and
[1:04:22] many times a trial can feel very long
[1:04:24] but it's just for a moment
[1:04:26] moment and it worketh for us a far more
[1:04:30] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory
[1:04:32] thank you Lord so it's not here to break
[1:04:33] us it's not here to destroy us no it's
[1:04:37] actually working for us a far more
[1:04:39] exceeding and eternal weight of Glory so
[1:04:42] you got to look at your light Affliction
[1:04:44] and say you're working on my behalf
[1:04:46] thank you Lord God has put this in my
[1:04:48] life for
[1:04:49] me and you're a light Affliction and
[1:04:51] you're just for a moment am yes sir you
[1:04:54] remember seasons of your life you know
[1:04:55] you have a newborn baby you think man
[1:04:57] are they and you know they're going to
[1:04:58] grow up right but they're spewing over
[1:05:00] the floor they've got colock they're not
[1:05:02] sleeping there's diapers and all it's a
[1:05:04] season of life but it's just for a
[1:05:06] moment Yeah because sometimes you look
[1:05:09] back after th that th that time's well
[1:05:11] and truly gone you're thinking you know
[1:05:13] and then you get some kind of nostalgia
[1:05:15] feelings and babies and some of us do no
[1:05:19] not me it was I enjoyed it but I was
[1:05:22] happy to wave and see it Go by right but
[1:05:25] you see it but it see it feels when
[1:05:27] you're out of it just like a moment but
[1:05:29] when you're in it it feels like a very
[1:05:30] long time you're sleep deprived and man
[1:05:33] you and and Christine bore the massive
[1:05:35] brunt of it so I just got a little
[1:05:36] sliver I was like man this is too much
[1:05:38] and she's just powering on but you know
[1:05:40] it feels like a group a very heavy thing
[1:05:43] but you know they're going to grow up
[1:05:45] you know it's just for a
[1:05:47] moment right and it's actually working
[1:05:49] in Eternal way it's actually working for
[1:05:51] you what do you work patience you call
[1:05:55] on God
[1:05:56] more amen you can actually enter into
[1:05:58] their needs more you actually feel sorry
[1:06:00] you can relate to people who are you
[1:06:02] know who need help and you can't you
[1:06:03] know you know it it it changes you so
[1:06:06] that it's actually for your good it's
[1:06:08] not just for their good while they're
[1:06:09] fed and they're change and they're clean
[1:06:11] and blah blah no no it's more than that
[1:06:13] it works trials work on many angles it's
[1:06:16] like a pinball machine that pinball hits
[1:06:18] a lot of things in the machine as it
[1:06:20] goes through and like a trial can affect
[1:06:22] many different people but it's all for
[1:06:23] everyone's good yeah
[1:06:26] amen while we look not at the things
[1:06:28] which are seen But at the things which
[1:06:30] are not seen what is that that's God's
[1:06:32] word right we look to the end right amen
[1:06:36] for the things which are seen are
[1:06:37] temporal but the things which are not
[1:06:38] seen are Eternal Hallelujah so you're
[1:06:41] going through a trial you say Lord
[1:06:43] reveal to me that this is a light
[1:06:45] Affliction reveal to me this is just for
[1:06:47] a moment Lord may I not be consumed in
[1:06:50] the here and the now and the you know
[1:06:52] the this is what's going on May I not be
[1:06:53] fixed cuz the devil wants you to be
[1:06:55] fixed on that because if you're fixed on
[1:06:57] that then you'll be humanly trying to
[1:06:58] sort things out right but if you look at
[1:07:01] it through God's eyes how God sees it
[1:07:03] cuz this is how God sees it Paul wasn't
[1:07:05] just filling in letters while can't
[1:07:06] think of anything to write to the
[1:07:07] Corinthians let's make them feel a bit
[1:07:09] better no he was revealing to us this is
[1:07:11] what trials are this is what hardships
[1:07:13] are they're a light Affliction they're
[1:07:14] doing they're working for your good
[1:07:16] they're just for a moment okay so if we
[1:07:18] can look at it that way we won't fear
[1:07:20] won't grip us so we won't work out
[1:07:23] things humanly
[1:07:25] yeah
[1:07:26] true now this is a very nice scripture
[1:07:28] but I but I pray this is a revelation to
[1:07:31] you behold I have created the Smith that
[1:07:33] bloweth the coals in the fire and that
[1:07:35] bringeth forth uh an instrument for his
[1:07:38] work I have created the wasted to
[1:07:40] destroy this is the Lord saying I've
[1:07:42] created the wasted to destroy no weapon
[1:07:45] that is formed against thee shall
[1:07:47] prosper that's right I trust this
[1:07:49] anchors in here this is how God thinks
[1:07:52] amen because God knows the end from the
[1:07:53] beginning he knows the day he created
[1:07:56] the devil remember you came from the
[1:07:57] mind of God you came from God you go
[1:08:00] back to God the devil was created he
[1:08:02] wasn't an elected Angel right and the
[1:08:05] angels that fell with him they were just
[1:08:06] created they have an expiry date
[1:08:08] remember there'll come a day where the
[1:08:10] devil will never be am he's gone he's
[1:08:13] burning and we're dancing Amen on the
[1:08:15] streets of gold and to me I'm not
[1:08:17] dancing cuz he's burning I'm dancing cuz
[1:08:18] I'm on the streets of gold Hallelujah
[1:08:20] hey he could be who cares what he's
[1:08:22] doing I I'm an eternity right but you
[1:08:25] see there'll come a day there's a time
[1:08:27] in the Book of Revelation where the
[1:08:29] devil gets off and we continue on so
[1:08:31] you've got to realize a trial may get on
[1:08:33] but it's going to get off right you got
[1:08:35] to realize that you say I'm going
[1:08:36] through a big problem no it's it got on
[1:08:38] it got off amen it will get off amen so
[1:08:41] so no weapon formed against you shall
[1:08:43] prosper I pray this becomes a revelation
[1:08:46] it's not just something to put on the
[1:08:47] fridge your Instagram that sounds good
[1:08:49] no this weapon that's been formed
[1:08:51] against me will not Prosper amen it's
[1:08:53] not going to win it's not going to have
[1:08:55] Dominion is not going to conquer me no
[1:08:57] it's going to come to an end amen amen
[1:08:59] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:09:02] me in judgment thou shall condemn
[1:09:04] Hallelujah who's ever felt a condemning
[1:09:06] Voice or thought come when you're in a
[1:09:08] trial oh yeah what is that that's a
[1:09:11] voice rising in judgment well if you did
[1:09:14] this this wouldn't happened and this
[1:09:15] happened because of this and this is
[1:09:16] you're the problem
[1:09:18] and no God's using this to mold God's
[1:09:21] using this to shape amen God's using
[1:09:23] this to show his glory right but you've
[1:09:26] got to stand on your feet say Satan I'm
[1:09:28] a redeemed Blood Washed Holy Ghost
[1:09:31] filled Son of God daughter of God I've
[1:09:33] been redeemed by the blood of Jesus
[1:09:35] Christ I belong to him and he can't lose
[1:09:37] me amen so that's why you got to raise
[1:09:39] up say Satan shut up and sit down no
[1:09:42] this is the hour for the bride to speak
[1:09:43] it's not the hour for unbelief to speak
[1:09:45] it's not the hour for problems to speak
[1:09:47] it's time for people to stand up with
[1:09:49] the word of God and confess it and say
[1:09:51] God your word is true amen so no weapon
[1:09:54] that's formed against the Prosper it may
[1:09:56] be sickness it may be financial trouble
[1:09:58] may be trouble in the family may be in
[1:10:00] your body going through a time of life
[1:10:01] or menopause or whatever it may be this
[1:10:03] thing will not Prosper against you why
[1:10:05] because these things cannot take
[1:10:07] Revelation from a soul amen the devil
[1:10:10] can't take Revelation from you that's
[1:10:12] right he can't touch your soul I mean he
[1:10:14] can attack your body he he can attack
[1:10:16] your mind but he can't take that
[1:10:18] Revelation out of your heart that's why
[1:10:20] you got to realize that this thing will
[1:10:21] not Prosper you know sure some people
[1:10:23] they get sick and die God uses is that
[1:10:25] sickness to take them to Heaven am oh my
[1:10:28] Lord right but if they can just be but
[1:10:30] the thing is the closer people get to
[1:10:32] death that are Christians the more happy
[1:10:34] they are because their reasoning begins
[1:10:36] to leave and the true self comes forth
[1:10:40] you know like brother Ram said about
[1:10:41] that Sunday school teacher she backslid
[1:10:43] went to a denominational Church she's a
[1:10:45] Sunday school teacher she got some
[1:10:46] sickness and you know she's dying there
[1:10:48] in the hospital and her Sunday school
[1:10:49] class came to you know say goodbye she's
[1:10:53] on her deathbed you know and and as she
[1:10:56] was dying her reasoning left her and she
[1:10:59] realized her true spiritual State and
[1:11:02] she cried out I'm lost that preacher you
[1:11:05] know the the minister was there smoking
[1:11:06] cigarettes saying you lied to me go get
[1:11:08] that Holy Ghost Holy Roller girl there
[1:11:11] you know go get that preacher you and
[1:11:12] she sadly she died in that state but now
[1:11:15] if you take the flip side of that and
[1:11:18] you take a real believer who sealed into
[1:11:20] the kingdom they could come into that
[1:11:22] hospital with trouble on their mind
[1:11:24] worry concerned all these things but
[1:11:27] then when they're when they're about to
[1:11:29] cross over all that reasoning will leave
[1:11:32] them and their true self will come to
[1:11:34] the Forefront instead of crying out I'm
[1:11:36] lost I'll say I'm saved Hallelujah Jesus
[1:11:38] in the room to take me away hallelujah
[1:11:41] hallelujah he's here to carry me home
[1:11:43] amen and be and all that all that
[1:11:45] reasoning and trouble would leave them
[1:11:47] like that why cuz the true self comes
[1:11:49] forth what if we just s thought like
[1:11:52] that all the time cuz that's how the
[1:11:54] Lord Jesus Jesus thinks of you and I
[1:11:56] when you were when he was on the cross
[1:11:58] you were on his mind the joy set before
[1:12:01] him going up gogoa that day was you
[1:12:03] redeemed around the throne amen so when
[1:12:05] he died he thought of you amen he knew
[1:12:08] he did that on your behalf amen amen
[1:12:11] praise God so what if we thought like
[1:12:13] that all the time prise the Lord we you
[1:12:15] know don't let our reasoning and trouble
[1:12:18] tear us down say no I know in whom I
[1:12:20] have believed amen hallelujah
[1:12:25] praise the Lord amen now the thing is
[1:12:29] man operates by fear because they don't
[1:12:33] know like heaven
[1:12:34] knows right and hell don't tell the
[1:12:37] truth anyway so they don't know like
[1:12:39] hell knows either right but fear comes
[1:12:42] in when man tries to reason things out
[1:12:45] and tries to work things
[1:12:47] out man will do crazy things when
[1:12:49] they're
[1:12:50] afraid fear is such a
[1:12:53] killer popularity comes because of fear
[1:12:57] people want to be popular they're afraid
[1:12:59] of what people think of them and it's
[1:13:02] such a it's such a snare
[1:13:04] now Saul King Saul Now not not Saul who
[1:13:08] became Paul he operated the kingdom by
[1:13:11] fear think about it he was anointed by
[1:13:14] the prophet of God the spirit of God
[1:13:16] changed him but yet he operated the
[1:13:19] kingdom by fear there was a time when he
[1:13:22] was calling wanted to call Israel to to
[1:13:25] a battle and he cut up an oxen sent the
[1:13:27] four parts to the different parts of the
[1:13:28] nation and said if you don't come you're
[1:13:30] going to be like this dead animal so it
[1:13:32] was fear that was motivating cuz he
[1:13:34] wasn't thinking like heaven was thinking
[1:13:36] he wasn't thinking like the word was
[1:13:38] thinking he wasn't thinking how the word
[1:13:40] would say if you follow me with all your
[1:13:42] heart and love me then then you will be
[1:13:45] the head and not the tail one will chase
[1:13:47] a th000 two will chase 10,000 amen this
[1:13:49] is your inheritance this is your promise
[1:13:51] he wasn't thinking like that he didn't
[1:13:53] know like heaven knew amen he was
[1:13:55] because of fear he was trying to you
[1:13:57] know run run the kingdom the wrong
[1:14:00] way but yet he would wrap it with a
[1:14:03] religious
[1:14:06] rapping you see he would he would he was
[1:14:09] instructed by Samuel wait for a certain
[1:14:12] day and I'll come and sacrifice then you
[1:14:14] can go fight the battle and on the
[1:14:17] evening time of that seventh
[1:14:19] day Saul because of fear sacrificed
[1:14:23] himself so his re because he wasn't
[1:14:26] thinking because Samuel knew when he was
[1:14:29] going to come and Samuel we know is the
[1:14:31] word of God to Israel that time because
[1:14:33] he's a prophet right so if he just if if
[1:14:36] Saul just believed the same way Heaven
[1:14:39] believed I'm I'm I'm just using the
[1:14:42] title all the time because I want that
[1:14:43] to stick right if he if Saul just
[1:14:45] believed like heaven believed he would
[1:14:48] have waited for Samuel he wouldn't have
[1:14:50] been worrying he wouldn't have been
[1:14:51] freeding he wouldn't have been troubled
[1:14:52] by some of the men leaving the Army he
[1:14:55] said no this is what God has said I'm
[1:14:57] staying with the word I'm not and then
[1:15:00] but the thing is he didn't do that cuz
[1:15:02] he didn't have that Revelation see he's
[1:15:04] just going by human understanding so
[1:15:06] fear came in and he gave you you he made
[1:15:09] the sacrifice and then when the
[1:15:10] sacrifice it ended then Samuel turned up
[1:15:14] but you see King Saul here said because
[1:15:16] I feared the people and obeyed their
[1:15:17] voice this is verse 24 so so he so he
[1:15:20] gave the sacrifice because he fear
[1:15:23] motivated him now how many
[1:15:26] people rule their family have a
[1:15:29] Christian walk out of
[1:15:31] fear they do things because they're
[1:15:33] afraid they're afraid of hell they're
[1:15:35] afraid of the wrath of God they're
[1:15:36] afraid of the tribulation they're afraid
[1:15:37] of this they're afraid that you know
[1:15:39] their you know their children will
[1:15:41] actually have their own thoughts and
[1:15:43] they have their own humanity and their
[1:15:45] wife will actually have her own
[1:15:47] personality and there may be some
[1:15:49] laughter in the home and you know there
[1:15:50] may be some Joy you know they want to be
[1:15:52] all restricted down like a like put a
[1:15:55] duvet in one of those vacuum bags and
[1:15:57] suck it all right down that's what fear
[1:15:58] does will suck everything right down and
[1:16:01] people will oh but I'm in the message no
[1:16:03] but they're being they're operating out
[1:16:04] of fear because they're not walking with
[1:16:07] Revelation they're walking out of fear
[1:16:09] how many people you know how many people
[1:16:11] sadly we see that happens they're
[1:16:13] Christians out of fear not out of faith
[1:16:16] not by Revelation amen so so Samuel I
[1:16:19] mean sorry Saul LED his whole LED his
[1:16:22] whole Kingdom out of fear he worked out
[1:16:25] now what do I have to do this he said
[1:16:27] well I'm fulfilling the word you didn't
[1:16:29] come all these things no it was fear
[1:16:31] that motivated him but we're going to
[1:16:33] realize that fear doesn't belong to
[1:16:36] us you see fear will cause us to Pander
[1:16:39] to evil spirits fear will cause us to
[1:16:42] try and appease and just have no trouble
[1:16:46] and keep everything fine I don't want to
[1:16:48] upset that person no it's really a
[1:16:50] spirit many times if you stand for the
[1:16:53] word God will stand for you amen amen if
[1:16:55] you stand for the word God will stand
[1:16:57] for you say well I don't want trouble in
[1:16:59] my home well I'm sorry wherever Jesus
[1:17:01] goes there's
[1:17:02] trouble there was trouble in Jericho
[1:17:05] there was trouble in Nazareth there was
[1:17:07] trouble in the synagogue where he was
[1:17:09] raised up he said this day the
[1:17:10] scriptures fulfilled there wasn't a
[1:17:12] great pandemonium rejoicing worship go
[1:17:14] on no they got angry they wanted to
[1:17:17] Stone him they wanted to throw him down
[1:17:19] a cliff our lord Jesus you know you
[1:17:21] think about this guy you know he caused
[1:17:23] he caused trouble in the temple
[1:17:25] he caused trouble wherever he went he
[1:17:27] crossed the sea to deliver Legion caused
[1:17:29] trouble with the
[1:17:30] farmers so so the rural people didn't
[1:17:33] like him the city Folk didn't it was
[1:17:34] trouble everywhere amen and then you see
[1:17:37] the disciples what that same Jesus comes
[1:17:39] into them what do they get
[1:17:43] trouble through Great Tribulation do we
[1:17:45] enter into the kingdom of God yes amen
[1:17:47] right praise God Amen well I'm entering
[1:17:49] the kingdom of God so you you've got to
[1:17:51] expect trouble but you don't have to put
[1:17:53] up with the trouble you don't have it's
[1:17:55] not okay I'll yeah I'll punch you you
[1:17:57] punch me who's yeah I know I've seen it
[1:17:59] before but who's seen those videos where
[1:18:01] two guys are standing there facing off
[1:18:02] and they slap each other who's ever seen
[1:18:05] that it's a game I'll slap you first and
[1:18:08] you slap
[1:18:10] me it is
[1:18:13] insanity but yet but yet Christians will
[1:18:16] operate the same way they think well
[1:18:19] I've had a Victorious time so basically
[1:18:21] I slap the devil in other words now I've
[1:18:23] just going to wait for him to take his
[1:18:24] shot and they stand there and just take
[1:18:26] it that's Insanity no we're going to
[1:18:28] plead the blood I mean we have the best

[1:19:15] reason it's raining is because of
[1:19:17] you why do we put up with it come on why
[1:19:20] do we we've got to realize we have
[1:19:22] authority over the devil
[1:19:25] if you woke up on the wrong side of the
[1:19:26] beard some people say well I woke up on
[1:19:28] the wrong I'm grumpy today it's Grump

[1:19:50] have to stay that way no why why let the
[1:19:53] devil dictate you you have to be sad you
[1:19:54] have to be down this is your portion no
[1:19:57] my portion is Joy my portion is being
[1:19:59] drunk on the Holy Ghost my my portion is
[1:20:02] eternal life amen my portion is him you
[1:20:05] know is the Lord Jesus so you know but
[1:20:08] you see the thing is if we if the devil
[1:20:11] he tries to stop us believing like
[1:20:13] heaven
[1:20:14] believes amen it's like when you know
[1:20:16] you know the disciples would come back
[1:20:18] and they were rejoicing because they had
[1:20:19] authority over the devil and Jesus said
[1:20:21] no don't Rejoice over that Rejoice cuz
[1:20:23] your names are written in heaven amen so
[1:20:26] even greater than having authority over
[1:20:28] the devil you've got to realize your
[1:20:30] name is written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:20:31] Life amen if you could you could you
[1:20:33] imagine that could you imagine that and
[1:20:35] in a way we have looked at the Lamb's
[1:20:36] Book of Life but could you imagine that
[1:20:38] you you're transported up into heaven
[1:20:41] the record is
[1:20:42] open what's your name Benjamin John Glo
[1:20:45] oh yes you're on page 35 here you
[1:20:48] are wouldn't that be a jubilee wouldn't
[1:20:51] that be a jubilee wouldn't that be the
[1:20:53] most glorious thing Hallelujah when you
[1:20:55] saw that and then and then you read and
[1:20:57] and you see where why is only my name on
[1:21:00] the book oh because the lamb washed it
[1:21:03] that's just my name pardoned hallelujah
[1:21:05] it's all gone amen wouldn't that be a
[1:21:07] glorious thing but don't you realize
[1:21:09] you've actually been allowed to look
[1:21:10] into the Lamb's Book of Life amen
[1:21:12] because when the message when the word
[1:21:14] came your way Hallelujah it called you
[1:21:16] by name amen it may not have orderly
[1:21:18] said your name but it called you by name
[1:21:21] amen and what happened you responded to
[1:21:23] him you surrendered your life he filled
[1:21:24] you with the Holy Ghost and God's
[1:21:26] telling you your name is in the Lamb's
[1:21:28] Book of Life hallelujah amen that's how
[1:21:32] Heaven Heaven's records that's how
[1:21:33] Heaven's records think of you I think we
[1:21:35] should think about ourselves the same
[1:21:37] kind of way Hallelujah to the lamb glory
[1:21:40] to God glory to God Amen I think this is
[1:21:42] how we should look at ourselves amen we
[1:21:44] shouldn't operate by fear we should
[1:21:46] operate by Revelation you see when Saul
[1:21:49] was Saul was confronted with Goliath
[1:21:51] that fear he was walking with amen
[1:21:54] stopped them right there because fear
[1:21:57] could fear only motivates to a certain
[1:21:59] point you look at North Korea I wouldn't
[1:22:01] be surprised to that if that place ate
[1:22:03] itself up it's going to all
[1:22:05] dictatorships like that have to crumble
[1:22:08] cuz it's a kingdom of fear it's a
[1:22:10] kingdom of intimidation and that's how
[1:22:12] the devil wants to come in in our ranks
[1:22:15] is to have a kingdom of fear but no
[1:22:19] perfect love casts out all fear and
[1:22:21] we're living in a season of perfect love
[1:22:24] we should have have no fear the devil
[1:22:25] wants to put fear on you right yeah yeah
[1:22:28] I know I've shared the testimony
[1:22:29] probably many times but you know when
[1:22:31] when we were living there in frickleton
[1:22:32] Grove Christine and I and there was that
[1:22:34] there was that demon in the house we
[1:22:36] were renting and that Spirit was there
[1:22:37] felt trouble and fighting and oppression
[1:22:39] all these things being in the house and
[1:22:41] we're praying against it realizing this
[1:22:42] is not us you got to realize if the
[1:22:44] enemy comes against you it's not you
[1:22:47] it's the enemy it's not God it's not you
[1:22:50] it's the enemy it's either one of the
[1:22:52] three okay now now and we were praying
[1:22:56] against this thing for it to leave and I
[1:22:57] felt this fear come upon me when we were
[1:22:59] praying and after we finished praying
[1:23:01] Christian said how do you know I felt
[1:23:02] fear well I was feeling it now I had I
[1:23:05] had two choices in that moment I could
[1:23:07] either succumb to the fear or this is
[1:23:09] terrible there's a there's a
[1:23:11] supernatural being in the house and you
[1:23:13] know oh no maybe the blood's not strong
[1:23:15] enough maybe I'm not right with God I
[1:23:16] could have those kind of feelings those
[1:23:18] kind of thoughts all right or I could
[1:23:20] have like I said I said Satan you have
[1:23:22] no right to put your fear upon me I
[1:23:24] rebuke in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:23:26] amen was the fear feeling real yes amen
[1:23:29] was it a real emotion yes did I feel it
[1:23:31] yes but what do you do with it you
[1:23:34] either accept it and let it rule you or
[1:23:36] you rebuke it because you realize God
[1:23:38] has given you authority over the enemy
[1:23:40] and in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:23:42] commanded to leave that Spirit left
[1:23:43] shortly after that there was such peace
[1:23:45] in that
[1:23:46] home so just because because many people
[1:23:49] look at me say oh I feel fearful
[1:23:50] sometimes therefore I must not have
[1:23:51] perfect love no that feeling tries to to
[1:23:54] come upon you to intimidate you to try
[1:23:57] and get you to second guess your
[1:24:00] salvation are you with me today so don't
[1:24:03] let fear intimidate you well what if I
[1:24:06] what if I what if I no what has Jesus
[1:24:08] done what has he already done for you
[1:24:10] amen sir see if we just thought like he
[1:24:12] did I think we could just go rejoicing
[1:24:14] amen
[1:24:17] hallelujah amen you say well I've got a
[1:24:19] lot of trouble I've got a lot of things
[1:24:21] how do I how do I break out of this how
[1:24:23] do I think like heaven thinks you got to
[1:24:26] focus on the
[1:24:27] Promises remember you've only got so
[1:24:29] much bandwidth I think I've just got
[1:24:31] dial up you
[1:24:33] know but I've got some okay I've got
[1:24:36] some praise the Lord I've got some so
[1:24:38] it's very limited what go what can
[1:24:40] happen okay it depends what I focus on
[1:24:44] is what's going to fill here right it's
[1:24:46] like a news feed or whatever you're
[1:24:47] looking at on your phone you know your
[1:24:49] screen is only can only be filled with
[1:24:50] certain thing right so now I could
[1:24:54] either focus on my problems and my
[1:24:56] situation and the what could bees which
[1:24:58] are always negative see the devil never
[1:25:00] says imagine God coming down to your
[1:25:02] house imagine the angel because the
[1:25:04] angel Lord visits homes you know imagine
[1:25:07] the Lord just stepping in that's right
[1:25:10] Hallelujah imagine the presence just
[1:25:12] changing in the room and you don't need
[1:25:14] to tell your children or your wife or
[1:25:16] your or your husband he's here they all
[1:25:17] know he's here and you just have a
[1:25:19] glorious Jubilee for however long just
[1:25:22] just worshiping and rejoicing you can
[1:25:24] have that kind of a visitation do you
[1:25:26] believe that we don't need to wait for
[1:25:28] camp or church to have a glorious
[1:25:29] visitation with God he can step in you
[1:25:31] can be driving along and you can be
[1:25:34] having a jubilee in a traffic jam and
[1:25:36] you can be glad for the traffic jam
[1:25:37] because that means you're longer in the
[1:25:39] car with him Hallelujah this ain't Pie
[1:25:41] in the Sky these things happen glory to
[1:25:43] God you can be at work man there was um
[1:25:45] it was after Jimmy preached the Thursday
[1:25:47] man I was just I was just doing my job

[1:25:52] felt such a sweet humble presence around
[1:25:54] me Hallelujah it was such a glorious
[1:25:57] Thursday thank you brother Jimmy for
[1:25:58] that service but what was that brother R

[1:26:02] around you you feel the sweet humble
[1:26:05] presence that was a good day Hallelujah
[1:26:08] we can have that more but what's going
[1:26:10] on in your fiber copper fiber optic
[1:26:15] connection you got to focus in on the
[1:26:17] promise amen now we know that
[1:26:21] technology uh represents something in
[1:26:23] the spiritual
[1:26:25] now this is a nuclear fusion reactor
[1:26:28] they're trying to build everyone around
[1:26:29] the world's trying to build these things
[1:26:31] so what they're trying to do basically
[1:26:33] is replicate the sun on the earth so the
[1:26:36] power in the sun they want to replicate
[1:26:38] it on the earth so the Sun what it does
[1:26:41] is it fuses hydrogen different atoms
[1:26:43] together and it releases releases energy
[1:26:45] and that's why you can that's why we get
[1:26:47] warm that's why we have sunlight because
[1:26:49] of a fusion reaction two atoms being
[1:26:51] fused together so they're trying to
[1:26:53] replicate this
[1:26:54] in a basically a big giant donut thing
[1:26:56] with a strong gravitational field mag
[1:26:58] magnetic field and superheat at
[1:27:00] different things now the longest they
[1:27:02] can cause this to happen is for about 48
[1:27:05] seconds is the longest they can get it
[1:27:07] and they've actually got it now that the
[1:27:09] energy they get out is greater than the
[1:27:11] energy they put
[1:27:12] in now one of the ignition sources for
[1:27:15] this is when they get a they get
[1:27:17] multiple laser beams and they focus it
[1:27:19] on two two atoms of uh heavy hydrogen
[1:27:24] so all these laser beams fire down on
[1:27:27] these hydrogen atoms and it causes this
[1:27:29] thing to ignite and then all this energy
[1:27:31] is released now I was thinking about
[1:27:34] this remember because the natural types
[1:27:36] are spiritual so they're trying to
[1:27:38] replicate the power of the sun which is
[1:27:41] is unlimited upon the earth now they've
[1:27:44] got to realize that God has already made
[1:27:47] this and I'm not talking about the s n
[1:27:50] no he has replicated the s o n upon the
[1:27:53] Earth
[1:27:54] Amen in a body of people amen that it's
[1:27:57] unlimited you got to realize if you have
[1:27:59] the Holy Ghost this morning you have
[1:28:01] unlimited power there is unlimited
[1:28:04] potential amen there is there's there's
[1:28:07] no limit to what God could lead you to
[1:28:09] pray for there's no limit to what God
[1:28:11] could cause you to do you amen that that
[1:28:15] power has already been replicated upon
[1:28:16] the Earth amen but so but what they do
[1:28:18] is they get all these lasers to focus in
[1:28:20] on one promise or two Adams right and
[1:28:24] what happened in the upper room 120 in
[1:28:26] the upper room they got God got 120
[1:28:28] Believers focused on one promise I mean
[1:28:32] and that promise was I'm going to pour
[1:28:34] out my spirit upon All Flesh I will
[1:28:36] fulfill the promise of Joel so all them
[1:28:38] got all their Humanity out of the way
[1:28:40] their carnality their fear their
[1:28:42] whatever's happened in the last week and
[1:28:44] they focused in on the promise saying
[1:28:47] This Promise is true this is the season
[1:28:49] God's going to manifest it it's going to
[1:28:51] happen and what to do God got them in I
[1:28:54] to fulfill the word amen now friends how
[1:28:57] much more now you and I if we could
[1:28:59] focus in on the Promises of God as an
[1:29:02] individual as a family as a church we
[1:29:03] get not focus on problems not focus on
[1:29:06] fussing not focus on fear but focus on
[1:29:09] faith amen what if we focused what could
[1:29:12] happen there could be a spontaneous amen
[1:29:15] ignition of unlimited power amen with
[1:29:18] the Holy Ghost pour himself out change
[1:29:20] lives bring protocols home bring healing
[1:29:22] bring restoration bring salvation amen
[1:29:25] God it's unlimited with what God could
[1:29:28] do who's with me tonight now this
[1:29:31] morning now this ain't sometime in the
[1:29:32] future I'll say they're trying to get
[1:29:34] this up and running but this has been up
[1:29:36] and running for 2,000 years Hallelujah I
[1:29:38] mean since the day of Pentecost we've
[1:29:39] had nuclear fusion reactors walking
[1:29:41] around in bodies of Flesh amen what the
[1:29:44] power of the S so n living Hallelujah
[1:29:47] hope you don't mind the science lesson
[1:29:48] but you see now it's
[1:29:50] unlimited but that's how heaven knows
[1:29:53] you
[1:29:54] yes Jesus knew who he was he wasn't
[1:29:58] guessing am I the Messiah I don't feel
[1:30:00] like the Messiah today well I feel like
[1:30:01] I'm today you know no no he knew who he
[1:30:04] was he knew what God had made him to be
[1:30:07] and that gave him perfect Faith do you
[1:30:10] have a revelation in your heart that you
[1:30:12] are the bride of Christ amen do you have
[1:30:14] that Revelation that you're part of this
[1:30:16] word that you're here that God wants to
[1:30:18] use you to fulfill his word he wants to
[1:30:21] fulfill prophecy in your life amen do
[1:30:24] you have that Revelation in here amen
[1:30:26] well that that should give you perfect
[1:30:29] Faith well then people say well if I
[1:30:32] have perfect faith I could speak
[1:30:33] whatever I want and get it that's not
[1:30:35] perfect Faith perfect faith is being
[1:30:37] surrendered to God and then when God
[1:30:39] wants to speak and do what he wants to
[1:30:41] do he does
[1:30:42] it amen remember remember the Holy Ghost
[1:30:45] we don't use the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:30:47] Ghost uses
[1:30:49] us amen we are not here to twist God to
[1:30:52] our will no we are here that God would
[1:30:55] mold us and change us to his will and
[1:30:58] remember Jesus was the first nuclear
[1:31:00] fusion reactor Hallelujah he was all the
[1:31:03] power would ever be in all the rectors
[1:31:04] around the world in one man the fullness
[1:31:06] of godhe bodily right amen and he said
[1:31:09] I've not come to do do my own will but
[1:31:10] the father's
[1:31:12] will Hallelujah but that gave him
[1:31:14] perfect Faith now what about you and I
[1:31:17] friends because we got to realize we
[1:31:19] have received a word that gives us
[1:31:20] perfect Faith this message produces per
[1:31:24] perfect Faith amen and that's why all
[1:31:26] hell is against this Revelation because
[1:31:29] the devil realizes because he's seen it
[1:31:31] before if God ever gets into people
[1:31:34] again if this word ever puts on flesh
[1:31:37] again I've got big trouble yeah my my
[1:31:40] kingdom is going to be laid waste amen
[1:31:42] what I really know in my heart I'm going
[1:31:44] to see you know who's people people you
[1:31:46] know well let's just take the positive
[1:31:49] side who's ever been longing for a day
[1:31:51] or for a moment and then you're finally
[1:31:52] in it you imagine what it's going to be
[1:31:55] like how maybe maybe all of us who got
[1:31:57] married you know you know it's going to
[1:31:59] happen even before you get engaged you
[1:32:02] know what's going to happen and then you
[1:32:03] get engaged and the countdown's Really
[1:32:05] on then you set a date oh my it's pinned
[1:32:09] the invitations are out and it's
[1:32:11] countdown time and then slowly then the
[1:32:14] dress comes then the recept you know all
[1:32:17] the all the details you need for a
[1:32:18] wedding where the ceremon is going to be
[1:32:20] who's going to be the celebrant the
[1:32:22] guest the uh you know the best man the
[1:32:25] you you all those things the Bridesmaids
[1:32:28] all those things they come into
[1:32:30] manifestation Hallelujah so what was
[1:32:33] just a will you marry me I love you will
[1:32:35] you marry me and a yes becomes
[1:32:39] manifested and then so the excitement
[1:32:41] begins to build because what was just a
[1:32:43] a wonderful idea that you believed was
[1:32:46] going to happen your faith now become sa
[1:32:49] and then there's the morning man I
[1:32:51] nearly put food on my suit anyway I
[1:32:54] didn't that was fine but you know but
[1:32:56] but there's the morning and and you've
[1:32:58] had the rehearsal you've had all these
[1:32:59] things now finally here's the day and
[1:33:02] then you're standing in the moment oh
[1:33:06] hallelujah praise God who remembers that
[1:33:08] moment if you haven't had that moment
[1:33:10] yet I pray you have that moment it's
[1:33:11] incredible time and then the rest of
[1:33:13] your life is awesome too but you know
[1:33:14] what I mean but but so you're longing
[1:33:16] for that time and then it happens amen
[1:33:19] now you take the flip side of that and
[1:33:21] all of your just like the devil his
[1:33:23] because his kingdom is ruled by fear
[1:33:25] it's not ruled by Revelation it's ruled
[1:33:27] by fear so all of his greatest
[1:33:30] fears are becoming it's not just he's
[1:33:33] kicked out of heaven but it becomes more
[1:33:36] material all the time where God said to
[1:33:38] the said to him in the garden the seed
[1:33:40] of the woman's going to bruise the head
[1:33:41] of the seed of The Serpent and then
[1:33:43] deliverer started to come Moses came
[1:33:46] Abraham came no was here these are not
[1:33:48] an order as you know but you know God
[1:33:49] would manifest himself down all the way
[1:33:51] through what's happening that promise is
[1:33:54] becoming more
[1:33:55] materialized so his fear and anxiety
[1:33:58] just begins to go higher and higher and
[1:34:00] higher and higher because the sum of all
[1:34:02] fears of him are becoming manifested
[1:34:05] right and then finally the Lord Jesus is
[1:34:08] born and he says if thou be the Son of
[1:34:10] God he tries to kill him as a 2-year-old
[1:34:12] doesn't work he tries to do all kind of
[1:34:13] things doesn't work he cannot stop this
[1:34:15] man I mean he can't make a temporise
[1:34:18] like he did in did in did in Moses he
[1:34:20] can't make you know anything happen like
[1:34:22] that caus Joseph to lie cuz all the
[1:34:25] Believers down Through the Ages have had
[1:34:27] something against them but this man's
[1:34:29] different cuz he's the God man so he
[1:34:31] couldn't cause he couldn't cause this
[1:34:33] man to fall like he did the others and
[1:34:35] then now he's hanging on Calvary and
[1:34:38] then then he gives his last breath he
[1:34:40] goes down into hell takes the keys of
[1:34:42] Hell death and the grave off him and
[1:34:44] then now the devil his fear is now now
[1:34:46] Adam's restored What About Eve so he
[1:34:50] tries to get into the church he tries to
[1:34:52] make it lukewarm for and Powerless but
[1:34:55] then now we're coming to the end time
[1:34:56] where God sends Malachi 4 to restore the
[1:34:58] faith of the fathers and then now what
[1:35:01] what what the devil saw at Pentecost is
[1:35:05] what the devil sees now
[1:35:07] amen hallelujah so now the devil begins
[1:35:10] to see the bride of Christ rising up
[1:35:12] realizing who she is amen realizing who
[1:35:16] she is as God knows her Hallelujah so
[1:35:19] what's happening the sum of all of his
[1:35:21] fears are becoming manifested yes amen
[1:35:24] amen and that's why he tries to put you
[1:35:26] under the same blanket to try and keep
[1:35:29] you down but if we just approach
[1:35:31] everything by divine
[1:35:33] revelation right and let Faith motivate
[1:35:36] our lives that will never bother us
[1:35:39] irrespective of what happens in life you
[1:35:42] know the devil says look this is going
[1:35:43] to happen you can say step one stop
[1:35:46] talking step two how do you know you
[1:35:48] don't
[1:35:49] know right no my father said this in his
[1:35:52] word my father has revealed this this to
[1:35:53] me not just in here but in here when's
[1:35:56] it going to happen that's up for God to
[1:35:58] do
[1:36:00] amenu praise the
[1:36:03] Lord let's just let's just finish with
[1:36:06] this quote but the church has received a
[1:36:08] Heavenly sign and
[1:36:10] Astronaut amen Jesus Christ in the form
[1:36:13] of a pillar of fire that he was in the
[1:36:15] Old Testament that he was when he met
[1:36:17] Saul on the road down there to Damascus
[1:36:19] the same Jesus here today and what does
[1:36:21] it do does it bring fear
[1:36:24] it brings love a uniting of one another
[1:36:27] amen a feeling for one another it brings
[1:36:29] the love of God a uniting uniting us and
[1:36:32] brings us the body of Christ into a
[1:36:33] Unity as a bride now that's what it's
[1:36:36] doing now this great Union amen amen do
[1:36:40] you I pray we know who we
[1:36:43] are no matter what's going on in life
[1:36:46] that don't change you that's right got
[1:36:48] to realize in the Garden of
[1:36:52] Eden God gave Adam and Eve dominion over
[1:36:55] Nature by creation by birth you put it
[1:36:58] that way Satan came along to Eve and
[1:37:00] said you'll be as Gods but by
[1:37:03] education and that word Gods there is
[1:37:06] Elohim you'll be like Elohim they
[1:37:07] already were like him because they had
[1:37:09] dominion over the Earth they were Gods
[1:37:10] over the Earth right so God made them
[1:37:14] Gods by
[1:37:15] birth Satan said no that was wrong Eve
[1:37:18] you need education to become what you
[1:37:20] already
[1:37:21] are God has given us the Dominion by a
[1:37:25] birth he's he G he he's given us all
[1:37:28] authority over the Enemy by birth it's
[1:37:31] not by education the Devil comes along
[1:37:32] and says well do you know enough have
[1:37:34] you prayed enough have you studied
[1:37:35] enough do you listen enough all those
[1:37:36] things are good we should be feeding on
[1:37:38] the word fill up on good things don't be
[1:37:39] the world's trash can okay fill up on
[1:37:42] good things but you got to realize your
[1:37:43] birth gives you Authority your birth
[1:37:46] gives you Authority it's not what you
[1:37:48] know how you know whatever no your birth
[1:37:50] gives you
[1:37:51] Authority amen your birth actually
[1:37:54] causes you to realize my father is
[1:37:57] God Amen then what can you do then you
[1:38:00] begin to
[1:38:01] know as Heaven believes about you you
[1:38:04] believe the same thing that no matter
[1:38:06] what happens in life like you imagine
[1:38:07] the Apostle Paul he's there in the
[1:38:10] dungeon he knows his head's going to be
[1:38:12] cut off now fear would want to grip him
[1:38:15] saying this is the end but thing is he
[1:38:17] had seen too much of the Lord he saw him
[1:38:19] on the road to Damascus it changed his
[1:38:21] life what he received a birth he saw the
[1:38:23] Lord Jes Jesus all the way through his
[1:38:24] life he knew he never failed and in that
[1:38:27] critical moment he he be to write to
[1:38:29] Timothy there's a Crown of Life awaiting
[1:38:32] me and all those that love him
[1:38:35] Hallelujah so that fear because you
[1:38:37] think you the devil wants to give that
[1:38:39] final kick I've got you now Paul and the
[1:38:41] thing that the devil tried to use was
[1:38:43] the death of this physical body but
[1:38:45] because Paul did not look at this world
[1:38:47] by natural eyes and natural
[1:38:49] understanding and by fear and reasoning
[1:38:50] he looked at it by faith he realized
[1:38:53] this is is not my end yeah this is
[1:38:55] allowing me to go where I really want to
[1:38:57] be Hallelujah so it doesn't matter what
[1:38:59] happens in life you say well
[1:39:00] everything's going wrong no but are you
[1:39:02] a child of God Amen just focus on that
[1:39:05] and rejoice Lord you've made me you've
[1:39:07] made me like you I am part of you Lord
[1:39:11] hallelujah so let's just finish there I
[1:39:13] just want to finish with that question
[1:39:14] Heaven Knows hell knows but do you about
[1:39:18] what God has made you
[1:39:20] already amen let's have the musicians
[1:39:22] this morning
[1:39:26] [Applause]
[1:39:29] amen I pray we all know who we are you
[1:39:32] say well I failed so many times that's
[1:39:34] why he died that's why the Lord Jesus
[1:39:36] died on Calvary he say there's a lot of
[1:39:38] moments in my Christian walk that I wish
[1:39:39] never happened that's why he
[1:39:41] died amen his grace is sufficient he's
[1:39:45] our he's our intermediary he's our
[1:39:46] intercessor he's our high priest is he
[1:39:48] not amen
[1:39:51] he we we need to look at our Christian
[1:39:53] walk through God's eyes remember Abraham
[1:39:56] had a lot of you read Abraham's Journey
[1:39:58] with God it wasn't just Sarah that
[1:40:00] laughed in the presence of God when God
[1:40:02] said I'm going to give you the promised
[1:40:03] son Abraham already did it here comes
[1:40:05] God down this great supernatural being
[1:40:07] comes down picture it and God says
[1:40:09] you're going to be the father of Nations
[1:40:10] your name is Abraham Abraham gets down
[1:40:13] in the dust and laughs at God At This
[1:40:18] Promise that's that's quite a thing
[1:40:21] where God has done all these things for
[1:40:22] him yeah then finally says I'm going to
[1:40:24] do this for you and he laughs but then
[1:40:27] now when God see see the devil want to
[1:40:29] take that and say look at what he did
[1:40:31] here how can he be the father of Faith
[1:40:33] but when God writes his commentary of
[1:40:35] his life after the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:39] he said he staggered not at the promise
[1:40:40] of God but was strong in the faith
[1:40:42] giving praise to God I think it's Romans
[1:40:44] chapter 4 so that's how God viewed
[1:40:46] Abraham we normally view ourselves as as
[1:40:49] the Genesis account of Abraham right
[1:40:52] this wrong I did this I did this but God
[1:40:55] looks at us in a totally different way I
[1:40:58] pray we can look at ourselves in that
[1:40:59] way too does it make you arrogant does
[1:41:01] it make you proud does it make you loose
[1:41:04] and LAX no it makes you more humble and
[1:41:07] thankful and you want to and and you
[1:41:10] love him
[1:41:11] more amen let's um let's
[1:41:14] stand
[1:41:17] amen I mean let's sing that song no
[1:41:19] matter what I see no matter what I hear
[1:41:21] no matter what I told I believe
[1:41:25] amen I'll lay a Hallelujah on the
[1:41:28] altar it looks like it's
[1:41:33] broken amen no matter what I
[1:41:38] see no matter what I
[1:41:41] hear no matter how I
[1:41:46] feel I
[1:41:49] believe no matter what I'm told
[1:41:54] no matter how it
[1:41:57] seems no matter what it
[1:42:01] comes I
[1:42:06] believe and if I look and it seems like

[1:43:09] God whenever I'm
[1:43:13] wey in the middle of the
[1:43:16] night when I can't see the
[1:43:21] light I believe

[1:43:27] H and the tears they
[1:43:32] fall through it

[1:43:40] believe and if I look at it seems like
[1:43:44] it's
[1:43:47] broken
[1:43:49] I'll
[1:43:50] Hallelujah on the
[1:43:55] alter and if I look and it seems like
[1:43:59] it's
