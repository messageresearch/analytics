[52:34] Mighty hand in Jesus Christ's name amen
[52:40] hallelujah amen thank you musicians
[52:43] Hallelujah you know it would be so nice
[52:46] to just have that music playing the
[52:47] whole time but it's not really the
[52:50] conventional thing that's done but it's
[52:52] just so nice you know you hear that
[52:55] sound and it can be arranged he said
[52:59] well
[53:01] amen well you know we're already quite
[53:03] different from other places that'll just
[53:05] make us even more different
[53:07] wouldn't hallelujah amen it's such a
[53:10] privilege to be here again this morning
[53:12] and we'll just get straight into the
[53:14] word of God because we don't want to
[53:16] have you standing too much longer so
[53:17] we're going to talk now uh
[53:20] from um 1 Samuel chapter 1
[53:28] and this morning's
[53:30] sermon is on driving out the debus
[53:34] sites and the subject under that title
[53:38] if you will
[53:40] is an anointing David
[53:44] King amen amen and we've alluded to this
[53:48] in the subconscious series quite a bit
[53:50] and this
[53:52] I is part of the it's kind of part of
[53:54] the subconscious series The to finish it
[53:57] off but it's also definitely a
[53:59] standalone sermon in
[54:01] itself and so it reads here in 1
[54:05] Samuel 1 verse
[54:09] 1-17 says here now there was a certain
[54:13] man of ramam Zam um of Mount Ephraim and
[54:17] his name was elaa the son of Jim and the
[54:21] son of ALU and the son of toou the son
[54:24] of Z and ephrathite and he had two wives
[54:28] the name of the one was Hannah and the
[54:31] name of the other was panina and panina
[54:34] had children but Hannah had no
[54:37] children and this man went up out of the
[54:40] city yearly to worship and to sacrifice
[54:43] unto the Lord of hosts and Shiloh and
[54:47] the two sons of Eli Hoff and finaz the
[54:51] priests of the Lord were there and when
[54:55] the time was that Kaa offered he gave to
[54:58] pan his wife and to all her sons and her
[55:01] daughters portions but unto Hannah he
[55:04] gave a worthy
[55:10] portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord
[55:14] had shut up her
[55:17] womb and her adversary also provoked her
[55:22] sore for to make her fret
[55:28] because the Lord had shut up her womb
[55:31] may the Lord add his Blessing to the
[55:32] reading of his word you may be
[55:39] seated Hannah had to suffer a
[55:42] reproach Hannah had to go through some
[55:45] great
[55:47] trials Hannah had to Bear the reproach
[55:50] of a Barren womb she wasn't able to have
[55:54] children and the the wife the other wife
[55:58] of her husband because back in those
[56:00] days they had polygamy where husbands
[56:03] could have multiple wives um and so she
[56:07] was sharing her husband with another
[56:09] another woman named panina and panina
[56:12] could had she had a lot of children so
[56:14] God was planning something for
[56:17] Hannah and so Hannah had to wait for
[56:21] children and God would shut up her womb
[56:25] and Hannah would would be laughed at and
[56:27] ridiculed and pressure upon her for many
[56:31] years of her life the prophet actually
[56:33] says that it was about 60 years of her
[56:36] life before she had a baby she was 60
[56:40] years old so God has an appointed time
[56:44] and so you can see now that in
[56:48] Hannah was this promise because we're
[56:52] going to continue reading soon and
[56:54] you'll see but I want to just
[56:57] put that in there that God shut up her
[56:59] womb it wasn't nothing that she
[57:02] did but God had an season for her to
[57:05] have a baby God made the season not
[57:09] Hannah and Hannah would have tried
[57:10] everything she could but
[57:13] God was developing a character in Hannah
[57:16] because Hannah was going to be used in a
[57:19] mighty way for the
[57:22] Lord and you'll see soon that Hannah was
[57:25] actually at the pivotal role the pivotal
[57:30] place of Israel's future the future of a
[57:33] Nation hinged on a on a 60-year old
[57:36] woman that was
[57:38] Barren so I'll just continue reading the
[57:40] story here and it says um from it says
[57:44] and as he did so year by
[57:46] year when she went up to the house of
[57:49] the Lord so she panina provoked Hannah
[57:54] therefore she wept and and she didn't
[57:56] eat then said alaa her husband to her
[58:00] Hannah why do you cry why weepest thou
[58:04] and why do you not eat and why is your
[58:07] heart grieved
[58:10] sad am I not better to you than 10
[58:14] sons and so Hannah rose up these are key
[58:18] words now she rose up something started
[58:22] rising in her amen amen amen something
[58:25] that was e external from her own being
[58:28] yes was starting to stimulate and stir
[58:31] within her life because she was sick of
[58:34] being Barren she was sick of being
[58:36] tormented she was sick of having a life
[58:39] that didn't have any fruit glory amen
[58:43] hallelujah and I'm sure we've all been
[58:45] through this Hallelujah no one wants to
[58:48] sit and be a fruitless person for the
[58:50] Lord amen hallelujah so Hannah rose up
[58:55] Hallelujah I like that
[58:56] and they after they had eaten in Shiloh
[59:00] and after they had drunk now Eli the
[59:02] priest sat upon a seat so here's the
[59:05] high priest now of Israel and he sat
[59:08] upon a seat by a post of the Temple of
[59:10] the Lord and she was in bitterness of
[59:14] soul and prayed unto the Lord and she
[59:18] wept sore so she was screaming and
[59:21] crying so emotional so desperate she
[59:25] needed to have a contact with God Amen
[59:28] she wasn't going to leave until she met
[59:30] God that day amen amen that's right
[59:32] Hallelujah and that makes me feel
[59:35] excited Hallelujah because I can
[59:37] identify with her I can identify with
[59:40] Hannah spiritually speaking amen amen
[59:44] hallelujah amen so now
[59:48] Hannah sorry I've lost my place here and
[59:52] and she was in bitterness of soul and
[59:54] prayed unto the Lord and wept saw and
[59:57] she vowed a
[59:59] vow she made a promise in other words
[1:00:02] and said oh lord of hosts if thou Wilt
[1:00:06] indeed look upon the Affliction of your
[1:00:11] handmaid and remember me and not forget
[1:00:14] your handmade but will give unto your
[1:00:17] handmaid a Manch child then I will give
[1:00:21] him unto the Lord all the days of his
[1:00:23] life and there shall no rer come upon
[1:00:27] his head and it shall come to pass as
[1:00:30] she continued praying before the Lord
[1:00:32] that Eli marked her mouth so now the
[1:00:35] high priest was watching her amen now
[1:00:38] we've got to look prophetically at this
[1:00:40] we can't just look at this in the
[1:00:41] natural because yes Eli was a natural
[1:00:43] man and he wasn't a very good high
[1:00:45] priest either he was old and he was and
[1:00:47] he was getting a bit slack but we're not
[1:00:49] looking at the human side of this now
[1:00:51] we're looking at the position cuz he was
[1:00:53] still the high priest he still was
[1:00:55] holding the most prestigious position in
[1:00:58] Israel yes and so we can't look we're
[1:01:00] going to look at the prophetic of this
[1:01:03] not the
[1:01:04] natural so now here's the high priest
[1:01:08] marking the mouth of this
[1:01:10] woman who wants to be
[1:01:13] fruitful and bringing in because with
[1:01:15] Israel your fruit is also part of your
[1:01:18] inheritance
[1:01:21] yes now therefore Eli
[1:01:24] thought oh here
[1:01:30] Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she
[1:01:32] spake in her heart only her lips moved
[1:01:36] but her voice was not heard now
[1:01:38] therefore Eli thought she had been drunk
[1:01:41] you know drinking and and Eli said unto
[1:01:46] her how long will you be drunk put away
[1:01:50] your wine from thee and Hannah answered
[1:01:52] and said no my Lord I am a woman of a
[1:01:55] sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither
[1:01:58] wine nor strong drink but have poured
[1:02:01] out my soul before the Lord am
[1:02:04] Hallelujah you know when you really get
[1:02:06] serious with God he knows when you
[1:02:09] really want something from God and you
[1:02:11] need it he knows he's listening to what
[1:02:14] this heart is speaking when you pour
[1:02:17] your soul out to God Amen he wants
[1:02:22] reality he wants sincerity he wants
[1:02:24] someone that means business that's
[1:02:27] serious with God that's
[1:02:31] that's certain of
[1:02:34] God count not thine hand made for a
[1:02:37] daughter of
[1:02:38] beel for out of the abundance of my
[1:02:41] complaint and grief have I spoken
[1:02:44] hitherto which means it's up to this
[1:02:46] point then Eli answered and said go in
[1:02:50] peace and the god of Israel Grant thee
[1:02:52] thy petition that thou has asked of him
[1:02:57] this is a glorious piece of
[1:03:02] scripture here is a
[1:03:05] woman that has been Barren and has been
[1:03:09] irritated by her sister you could say
[1:03:12] she's not quite her sister but she I
[1:03:14] guess she's the sister in the Lord in
[1:03:16] the Old Testament but panina now this
[1:03:20] other woman in her life was do you know
[1:03:23] the name panina means Pearl no and do
[1:03:25] you know what a pearl is it's a product
[1:03:27] of
[1:03:28] irritation when a piece of sand gets
[1:03:30] inside an oyster it bring that oyster
[1:03:33] now to protect itself it develops a
[1:03:36] pearl inside it and so you can see now
[1:03:39] that God is telling us through these
[1:03:41] people and through his stories because
[1:03:43] he remember God writes the Bible with
[1:03:46] these lives and he's telling a story and
[1:03:50] not just a story that you read and
[1:03:53] that's it but it's a prophecy he
[1:03:55] speaking of a people in this day he's
[1:03:59] speaking of you and me am right
[1:04:02] now that we also have had irritations
[1:04:05] come into our life that's
[1:04:08] right and if we can just keep our eyes
[1:04:11] focused on the
[1:04:13] vision and just be patient it might be
[1:04:16] struggling it might be hard it might it
[1:04:18] might almost destroy you yes but a pearl
[1:04:21] is forming amen there might be an
[1:04:24] irritation but a pearl is forming
[1:04:29] you cannot be
[1:04:31] destroyed every promise that God's
[1:04:33] promised you will be fulfilled in you
[1:04:36] just keep your eyes on Jesus Keep Your
[1:04:39] Eyes on him no matter what no matter how
[1:04:41] hard it is no matter all that's going on
[1:04:43] keep your eyes on him never let your
[1:04:46] testimony never let your testimony
[1:04:49] become negative that's right Andy it's
[1:04:51] very easy to
[1:04:52] default and and and and and and and and
[1:04:56] and and
[1:04:58] succumb and and allow your thoughts to
[1:05:00] just go down that negative
[1:05:03] path but something in Hannah all her
[1:05:06] life hallelujah amen I believe something
[1:05:09] in Hannah all her life was in there amen
[1:05:11] I believe there was a predestined plan
[1:05:13] for her amen I believe she had a
[1:05:16] predestined plan and God placed a seed
[1:05:19] of faith in Hannah's life Hallelujah
[1:05:22] that no matter how much hardship and how
[1:05:24] much trials and how much destruction and
[1:05:26] how much irritation and how much
[1:05:28] ridicule and how much reproach and all
[1:05:30] those
[1:05:32] things that faith never let her go and
[1:05:36] fall apart amen because Hannah plays a
[1:05:41] pivotal role who knows what pivotal
[1:05:43] means it's like the point of a turn
[1:05:46] where a nation would turn a corner Hanah
[1:05:50] played a pivotal and crucial role now
[1:05:53] God this is the amazing thing God placed
[1:05:56] confidence in that little seed of faith
[1:05:58] that he placed inside Hannah a woman
[1:06:01] that was Barren until she was 60 years
[1:06:03] old
[1:06:05] Hallelujah God knew that the fruit of
[1:06:08] her
[1:06:09] womb the fruit of her
[1:06:12] life would bring a nation to change
[1:06:17] would change the history and the future
[1:06:20] sorry not the history it would take it
[1:06:22] would turn what has been historically a
[1:06:24] foundation for Israel of confusion and
[1:06:28] destruction and idolatry and all sorts
[1:06:31] of a people that have no headship a
[1:06:35] people that have no
[1:06:36] King and God would hinge the future of
[1:06:39] his holy nation his holy people on the
[1:06:42] faith of one Barren 60y old
[1:06:46] woman who can
[1:06:49] identify with that who can identify in
[1:06:53] their own life
[1:06:56] how insufficient you
[1:06:58] feel when you know that God has placed a
[1:07:01] seed of faith in you that can change
[1:07:04] Nations that can change the world inside
[1:07:08] you you can't do nothing you just have
[1:07:10] to be faithful right you you cannot try
[1:07:14] and make it happen but there's times in
[1:07:17] your life where you need to go down to
[1:07:20] the
[1:07:20] temple yes
[1:07:23] Hallelujah there's time because there
[1:07:25] sometime that seed can lay dormant in
[1:07:27] your life that seed of Faith that's a
[1:07:30] nation changing world changing
[1:07:33] rapturing seed inside your
[1:07:37] life and that can lay dormant until you
[1:07:40] have had a visitation from the high
[1:07:42] priest Jesus Christ until you yourself
[1:07:45] have come down now Hanah
[1:07:49] she I might be getting a hit of myself
[1:07:51] but anyway she Hallelujah she actually
[1:07:56] when she came down she doesn't she
[1:07:58] wasn't worried about what all the other
[1:08:00] women were doing she didn't care about
[1:08:02] The Prestige of the temple and how good
[1:08:04] and nice it is she didn't even worry
[1:08:06] about anything that was going on about
[1:08:08] Eli's Sons or anything politics and this
[1:08:10] is wrong that wrong she had no she
[1:08:13] didn't want to she didn't want to borrow
[1:08:14] that stuff she meant business she was
[1:08:18] serious she came to the temple and she
[1:08:21] bypassed all of that amen you know that
[1:08:24] song Take Me pass the out of cours and
[1:08:27] the priest to sing your praise pass the
[1:08:31] Brazen outter Lord I want to see your
[1:08:35] face you know the song that song well
[1:08:38] that's the reality now this is Hannah
[1:08:40] now she's going past the brais AL pass
[1:08:42] the out pass the priest to sing your
[1:08:43] praise pass all their problems and
[1:08:45] politics and everything she wants to
[1:08:47] meet the high priest she wants to talk
[1:08:49] with God Amen because something was
[1:08:52] rising up within her a seed of faith was
[1:08:55] rising up Hallelujah Hannah rose up you
[1:08:58] see when she rose up something was
[1:09:00] actually Rising within her something was
[1:09:03] stirring some light must have been shown
[1:09:05] and maybe a scripture was read maybe a
[1:09:08] verse was read to her or someone shared
[1:09:10] a story about the Bible with her and
[1:09:13] that seed started rising up within her
[1:09:15] and it caused her to do things that she
[1:09:17] wouldn't normally do it caused her to
[1:09:19] make a fool of herself in front of other
[1:09:22] people amen and you know when that seed
[1:09:24] starts to work within you it can make
[1:09:26] you do things that you wouldn't normally
[1:09:28] do it can make you do things that would
[1:09:30] seem foolish to the world and foolish to
[1:09:34] those that don't have faith but amen you
[1:09:38] see she went down there and she got on
[1:09:41] her knees and she had a visitation from
[1:09:43] the high priest because God had placed
[1:09:45] in her a faith that would change that
[1:09:47] Nation
[1:09:49] Hallelujah a faith that would change
[1:09:51] that
[1:09:53] nation and this would change the
[1:09:57] administration of the time of Judges you
[1:10:00] know the time of Judges was before her
[1:10:02] so here you have a woman at which is the
[1:10:05] type of the church
[1:10:06] now here you have a church right that is
[1:10:10] placed in the in a pivotal point in time
[1:10:13] now we're speaking prophetically here so
[1:10:15] you need to spiritually think about
[1:10:17] this she was placed in a point of pivot
[1:10:22] where behind her was a time of judges
[1:10:25] behind her was a time of great politics
[1:10:27] fighting and all sorts of stuff a
[1:10:30] failure a great failure and in front of
[1:10:33] her was the prospect of a future of a
[1:10:37] righteous Godly King that would take now
[1:10:40] just please go with me I'm going to
[1:10:41] explain all this but would take
[1:10:43] everything that Joshua promised the
[1:10:48] everything all the inheritance and
[1:10:50] everything that was promised by
[1:10:53] Joshua would be that king would be
[1:10:56] anointed to take that and give it and
[1:11:00] claim it and make it
[1:11:04] yours now I believe we are in that same
[1:11:08] position amen amen we are in that same
[1:11:11] position and thank the Lord and praise
[1:11:13] the Lord that we've moved from that
[1:11:15] position in the positive way
[1:11:18] Hallelujah you see we but there are
[1:11:22] still many people and and as an indiv
[1:11:25] and and individuals would still be there
[1:11:28] because you've got to recognize now what
[1:11:31] are you going to do with your pivotal
[1:11:33] position what are you going to do when
[1:11:36] you're placed in that position of power
[1:11:39] that God has entrusted in you will you
[1:11:44] continue that in the time of Judges
[1:11:46] where there was no King where there was
[1:11:47] no headship where the after Joshua had
[1:11:50] died and the elders had gone and the
[1:11:52] people had just taken this whole message
[1:11:54] of Joshua and made a big mess out of it
[1:11:58] made it a big political thing and they
[1:11:59] fight this one and they don't talk to
[1:12:01] this one and that one doesn't happen and
[1:12:02] these ones are in the Millennium these
[1:12:03] ones have two Souls they can go and sin
[1:12:05] and do whatever they want right this is
[1:12:06] the time of Judges that Israel found
[1:12:08] themselves in and it's exactly the time
[1:12:11] of Judges that the people that came out
[1:12:13] under brother Brandon's message found
[1:12:15] themselves in but we now because we're
[1:12:18] at a purpal point where there's been a
[1:12:20] change of dispensation and that's a
[1:12:22] these are big words but this is what I
[1:12:24] believe the we are at a pivotal point
[1:12:26] where there's been a change of
[1:12:27] dispensation not because we've been any
[1:12:30] better not because we've done anything
[1:12:32] more but because this is the season this
[1:12:34] is the time this is the time where a
[1:12:37] heners would rise up Hallelujah and a
[1:12:40] henna would be able to choose now
[1:12:42] Hallelujah she will be able to choose
[1:12:45] now is she going to listen to that voice
[1:12:46] of Faith that's within her that voice
[1:12:49] that's Sayang go down to the temple go
[1:12:51] and meet the high priest become a
[1:12:53] fruitful person aren't you second
[1:12:55] warming up you and that alone aren't you
[1:12:57] sick of being baren don't you want to
[1:12:58] bring forth fruit Hallelujah that's
[1:13:00] right amen and you see now there is an
[1:13:03] opportunity for us as a group as
[1:13:06] individuals that make up a
[1:13:09] group to fulfill the
[1:13:11] scripture
[1:13:13] amen and we can choose now are you going
[1:13:17] to ignore that voice that's within
[1:13:19] you that's saying you know you just meet
[1:13:22] the high priest and become fruitful
[1:13:23] because of life that you bring forth
[1:13:26] this life that you'll bring
[1:13:30] forth will anoint David
[1:13:33] King you see
[1:13:37] Hannah because she was unselfish in her
[1:13:40] desire you see the prayer that she
[1:13:41] prayed she didn't just pray to have a
[1:13:43] child just for her and have riches or
[1:13:45] whatever and for selfish reasons she
[1:13:48] said oh Lord give me a boy I want to
[1:13:51] dedicate him to you Hallelujah her
[1:13:54] motive was right her objective was right
[1:13:56] you know what God blessed her so much he
[1:13:58] blessed her so much he gave her a
[1:14:00] prophet he gave her a man that would
[1:14:02] change the nation a man that would
[1:14:05] restore the people and the life that she
[1:14:08] brought forth brought the Thunder back
[1:14:11] to Israel amen you see because Samuel
[1:14:14] when he prayed down at ebener Hallelujah
[1:14:17] the Lord thundered against the enemies
[1:14:18] and it drove the enemies away amen
[1:14:21] hallelujah that was a life that Hannah
[1:14:23] brought forth amen was the fruit of her
[1:14:25] womb you see now everything you see in a
[1:14:29] natural way in the Old Testament she P
[1:14:32] for the natural child we're
[1:14:36] spiritual the natural child's finished
[1:14:39] with
[1:14:40] Mary when she had Faith she had to give
[1:14:44] birth to a natural Lamb of God she had
[1:14:48] to give birth to the Lamb of God who
[1:14:51] would atone and make the atonement for
[1:14:53] all of our sin right but that was still
[1:14:55] a life that she brought forth now I'm
[1:14:57] not ascribing Mothership to her because
[1:15:00] she wasn't the mother as such she was
[1:15:03] the
[1:15:03] incubator she brought forth the child
[1:15:06] but the faith that she
[1:15:08] believed she had a visitation from the
[1:15:11] high priest amen hallelujah she had a
[1:15:13] visitation from the mighty Angel that's
[1:15:15] right Hallelujah she got into an
[1:15:17] atmosphere amen and that angel preached
[1:15:19] a message to her and she received that
[1:15:22] yes and her life started changing amen
[1:15:25] she became fruitful she was no longer a
[1:15:28] Pew warmer amen amen she was no longer
[1:15:30] just a dormant person sitting in a
[1:15:32] synagogue listening to the priest
[1:15:34] Hallelujah she was far more than that
[1:15:36] now amen because she now came into
[1:15:39] personal contact with God and God made
[1:15:42] her a fruitful person and brought forth
[1:15:45] a natural living baby but you see now
[1:15:48] there does there is no need for a
[1:15:50] natural living baby to be born in our
[1:15:53] lives anymore but we bring forth a
[1:15:56] spiritual baby a spiritual child a
[1:15:59] spiritual life that will be raised up
[1:16:02] and continue to grow and grow and grow
[1:16:04] until it becomes a mature man and that
[1:16:06] is the man Christ Jesus on display that
[1:16:09] is the life that we bring forth and
[1:16:11] we've been placed in a pivotal point now
[1:16:14] prophetically speaking over the age now
[1:16:17] we're in a pivotal point where we can
[1:16:20] choose and many people unfortunately
[1:16:23] have chosen the wrong thing
[1:16:26] there are still people that Proclaim
[1:16:28] this message even
[1:16:29] ministers that continue in the time of
[1:16:31] Judges they continue fighting with each
[1:16:33] other they continue with their political
[1:16:34] ways they continue in this old
[1:16:37] administration because you see the the
[1:16:40] biggest issue that's gone on in history
[1:16:43] is that the doctrines have been right
[1:16:46] and the preaching's been good but the
[1:16:49] Min Administration has
[1:16:52] been wrong people have forced an image
[1:16:56] upon
[1:16:58] people people prob in the time of Judges
[1:17:01] after Joshua died there would have been
[1:17:02] zealous ministers and Priests that
[1:17:04] forced it upon the
[1:17:06] people that forced it and tried to make
[1:17:09] it happen and you know they corrected
[1:17:10] everything so hard so harsh and so
[1:17:13] negative that the people just crushed
[1:17:15] down and couldn't bear it ruling with
[1:17:18] malevolence ruling the way that they
[1:17:21] were brought up by their parents that's
[1:17:23] right ministers with good
[1:17:26] intentions legally brought up their
[1:17:29] Church the way that they were brought up
[1:17:31] by their parents hard
[1:17:34] cold you know strict so
[1:17:37] hard and you know it doesn't work it
[1:17:40] doesn't work like that but now that the
[1:17:44] time of Judges has come to an end now
[1:17:46] that we have a point here where we like
[1:17:48] Hannah we can choose are we going to
[1:17:51] continue down that path are we going to
[1:17:53] continue going that way or are we going
[1:17:55] to come under a different headship
[1:17:57] Hallelujah are we going to get serious
[1:17:59] with God till we meet the high priest
[1:18:01] and the high priest speaks a spoken word
[1:18:05] into our life and gives us an Immaculate
[1:18:07] Conception you know the Immaculate
[1:18:10] Conception was the the that Mary didn't
[1:18:13] know a man and gave forth a baby now we
[1:18:16] now can have an Immaculate Conception
[1:18:19] where we meet the Lord the high priest
[1:18:22] when we get serious with him Hallelujah
[1:18:24] and maybe it might take a bit of Shame
[1:18:27] Hallelujah it might take a little bit of
[1:18:28] embarrassment you might have to do
[1:18:30] things that you don't normally do to get
[1:18:32] it Hallelujah but you'll get it when you
[1:18:36] weep from your soul and bitterness of
[1:18:38] Soul however it happens when that
[1:18:40] desperation strikes you you cannot get
[1:18:42] desperate until God speaks to you did
[1:18:44] you know that you cannot become
[1:18:46] desperate until the voice of God speaks
[1:18:48] to you amen and you see I I believe that
[1:18:51] you know
[1:18:52] Hannah the voice of God would have spoke
[1:18:54] to her just before she rose up because
[1:18:56] something would have gone boom and that
[1:18:58] little seed inside started tingling or
[1:19:01] whatever it did it started moving
[1:19:03] Hallelujah she couldn't control herself
[1:19:05] anymore she just had to go there she had
[1:19:07] to go and meet the high priest
[1:19:09] Hallelujah because she played a pivotal
[1:19:11] role in the future of Israel because the
[1:19:14] life that she brought forth a prophet
[1:19:16] and that Prophet restored the seven
[1:19:18] Thunders to
[1:19:19] Israel in tight now that life was the
[1:19:23] Thunder that thundered out against the
[1:19:24] enemy yes and we've been told the same
[1:19:26] thing that what we need in Wellington
[1:19:30] amen what we need in sh Tabernacle is
[1:19:33] thousands of lived voices amen amen
[1:19:35] thundering out against the enemy amen
[1:19:39] now if you meet that high priest that
[1:19:41] high priest going to make you fruitful
[1:19:42] and that fruit of your womb spiritual
[1:19:44] womb is going to that that's going to
[1:19:47] bring forth a life that Thunders out
[1:19:49] against the enemy and
[1:19:52] humility such a testimony of an open
[1:19:54] book a testimony of the reality of Jesus
[1:19:57] Christ manifested on the Earth right now
[1:20:00] Hallelujah all right well we've got the
[1:20:02] overview now we'll just continue
[1:20:05] because I believe we are a privileged
[1:20:08] people amen a very privileged people we
[1:20:11] don't have to work through all of the
[1:20:12] baggage of having all the time and
[1:20:14] judges it's fresh amen amen amen amen we
[1:20:18] got a a white canvas Hallelujah that's
[1:20:20] been cover colored in by the the colors
[1:20:23] and paint of God
[1:20:25] amen I'm so happy about that that's a
[1:20:27] great thing Hallelujah and so we have
[1:20:31] the choice now as individuals now to get
[1:20:34] down and get
[1:20:35] serious be a be have conviction about
[1:20:38] your religion have conviction about
[1:20:42] Christianity not casual Christianity is
[1:20:45] not a casual thing
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:49] hallelujah it's not casual God is not a
[1:20:52] casual person he's a friendly person and
[1:20:55] he's gracious but he's not casual I
[1:20:58] don't believe God's casual he's not this
[1:21:00] cool guy that mixes around and can fit
[1:21:03] in so well he's got a serious
[1:21:06] personality actually he's balanced
[1:21:08] because he's good and severe it says
[1:21:11] behold or behold the goodness and
[1:21:14] severity of God so there's a severe side
[1:21:17] to God that you don't want to
[1:21:21] cross and then you know he tells the
[1:21:25] a testimony from the prophet he
[1:21:27] says that the Lord said to him and he
[1:21:29] gave him a vision of the mber you see
[1:21:31] you binded and unbind the m and and he
[1:21:33] said he said you've got to be more
[1:21:35] sincere and I was thinking to myself my
[1:21:37] goodness if he's got to be more sincere
[1:21:40] wow you know I couldn't think of anyone
[1:21:43] any more sincere Hallelujah so you see
[1:21:47] God was calling him to a place where he
[1:21:49] could entrust him with
[1:21:51] power and and God is bringing us as
[1:21:54] individ ual to a place where he can
[1:21:55] entrust us with power and that
[1:21:57] leadership starts in your own life how
[1:22:00] do you lead your emotional realm how do
[1:22:02] you lead your spirit do you lead your
[1:22:04] spirit with legalism do you force it
[1:22:06] upon yourself or are you able amen this
[1:22:09] is key are you able to catch the
[1:22:11] anointing are you able to contact God
[1:22:14] and allow his leadership to lead your
[1:22:16] spirit that's true benevolent leadership
[1:22:19] in your own life and until you can
[1:22:21] master
[1:22:23] that amen
[1:22:25] because that's how you're going to lead
[1:22:26] in the Millennium I believe this is just
[1:22:27] me I believe that that's how we're going
[1:22:29] to lead like that not with some
[1:22:32] horrible
[1:22:34] Draconian malevolent harsh leadership
[1:22:38] which is the old school time of Judges
[1:22:41] stuff it's not going to
[1:22:43] work we need to we have a we have the
[1:22:46] grace of God the Capstone himself the
[1:22:50] very the person of Jesus Christ crying
[1:22:53] Grace
[1:22:54] Grace he's come with grace that Grace is
[1:22:58] available to all of us for leadership
[1:23:01] Amen to lead Our Lives individually to
[1:23:04] lead our families as men and for the for
[1:23:06] the mothers to lead the children with
[1:23:08] the Fifth Gospel that's ministered to
[1:23:10] the children while the men are at work
[1:23:12] and however you know those things and
[1:23:14] how it all goes amen
[1:23:18] now to be able to lead in that
[1:23:22] way because that is a a huge thing in
[1:23:25] our own
[1:23:27] lives let's just go back to the word go
[1:23:30] back to where we were at now and I'll
[1:23:32] I'll jump into a bit more of that later
[1:23:35] on it says here in Philippians 3
[1:23:40] 13-4 says Brethren I count not myself to
[1:23:44] have
[1:23:44] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:23:48] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:23:51] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:23:53] which are before amen I press toward the
[1:23:56] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[1:23:59] of God in Christ Jesus this my friends
[1:24:02] brothers and sisters is the high calling
[1:24:04] of God Amen the High Calling of God is
[1:24:06] that you the life that comes out of your
[1:24:09] uh
[1:24:10] bows that comes through all the trials
[1:24:13] all the hardship and you meeting the
[1:24:14] high priest that life is the high
[1:24:17] calling that's calling that life is
[1:24:20] there's a there's a purpose in that life
[1:24:21] to come out of you there's a purpose
[1:24:23] there's a there's a place in the very
[1:24:25] cogs of God's Great Symphony God's great
[1:24:29] plan God's Great everything that God has
[1:24:32] planned for this hour comes from that
[1:24:34] life that comes from you yes amen now
[1:24:37] that life is got it's the will of God
[1:24:41] you can't produce it you have to have it
[1:24:44] you have to get it you have to come to a
[1:24:47] place where you where where you've
[1:24:48] really got
[1:24:49] it really got it and we have the choice
[1:24:52] now and once you've got it you can still
[1:24:54] choose now how you administer that
[1:24:57] because the
[1:24:59] administration is where people a lot of
[1:25:01] the times can go wrong or
[1:25:05] right the sermons and the doctrine can
[1:25:07] be correct but the but the
[1:25:09] administration can be wrong how do you
[1:25:11] administer it to yourself will be how
[1:25:14] you administer it to your children and
[1:25:15] to other people and so search thine
[1:25:19] heart oh man and and search the
[1:25:22] scriptures and see how Christ does it
[1:25:26] because we
[1:25:28] need to continue on because that life we
[1:25:33] don't bring forth a prophet we bring
[1:25:36] forth the testimony of Jesus this is
[1:25:39] where it ties in the testimony of Jesus
[1:25:43] is the spirit of
[1:25:45] Prophecy that's the life that we bring
[1:25:47] forth that ties into Hannah's life that
[1:25:50] shows in her life she brought forth a
[1:25:52] natural Prophet we bring forth the
[1:25:54] testimony of Jesus the spirit of
[1:25:57] Prophecy that Spirit of Prophecy is the
[1:25:59] life of the prophecy that's within you
[1:26:03] to fulfill the scripture of your life
[1:26:05] amen to fulfill the verses that pertain
[1:26:07] to you that's right Hallelujah that's
[1:26:09] the spirit of Prophecy that's working
[1:26:11] within you mightily Hallelujah to bring
[1:26:14] forth the vision so that you're walking
[1:26:17] in harmony with the notes of the music
[1:26:20] that God has written Glory that Spirit
[1:26:23] of Prophecy is is within you Hallelujah
[1:26:26] and until you get to the high priest
[1:26:29] Hallelujah and hear the spoken word from
[1:26:32] his mouth directly Hallelujah that high
[1:26:34] priest let me tell you from another
[1:26:36] picture is revelation chap 10 a mighty
[1:26:39] angel coming down with an open book in
[1:26:41] his hand saying come and eat from me
[1:26:44] hear my words yourself Hallelujah hear
[1:26:48] you listen to the voice of the Prophet
[1:26:52] but you need to hear the voice behind
[1:26:54] the voice that's the voice that you can
[1:26:57] personally hear Hallelujah and if God
[1:27:00] desires and decides to speak directly to
[1:27:02] you look to ear then praise the Lord
[1:27:04] that's also wonderful that's right it
[1:27:05] doesn't happen as often as we would like
[1:27:08] it but it does happen amen and God can
[1:27:11] speak to you hallelujah it's just where
[1:27:14] are your affections set where is your
[1:27:16] entertainment coming from what are you
[1:27:19] what's what's appeasing your appetite
[1:27:22] amen your affections and your your your
[1:27:26] imaginations what's appeasing that
[1:27:28] appetite for
[1:27:30] entertainment Hallelujah because if that
[1:27:32] if the tree of knowledge is appeasing
[1:27:35] that appetite then it's going to be very
[1:27:37] difficult for you to hear the voice of
[1:27:39] God because you've got other voices
[1:27:41] going on there's other things happening
[1:27:44] Hallelujah your subconscious is
[1:27:46] listening to the body language of all
[1:27:48] those movies that is being watched and
[1:27:50] it's clouding the discernment it's
[1:27:53] clouding your perception of reality as
[1:27:56] much as you can reason it out and go
[1:27:57] it's not true and it isn't your
[1:27:59] subconscious thinks it is amen it might
[1:28:02] not be for anyone in this room
[1:28:03] but someone might listen to that one day
[1:28:06] but your subconscious believes
[1:28:08] everything it sees and hears amen and so
[1:28:11] what you choose to expose yourself to
[1:28:14] will deter your so your subconscious
[1:28:16] you've basically told your subconscious
[1:28:18] this is good this is right that's right
[1:28:21] believe this and it it comes into your
[1:28:23] life and it affects you and it affects
[1:28:25] your judgment and it affects your your
[1:28:27] prayer life it affects everything either
[1:28:30] negative or positive it'll take you
[1:28:32] either way so that's why we have a great
[1:28:34] choice to
[1:28:37] choose
[1:28:41] amen because we have a high calling of
[1:28:44] God in Christ Jesus that high calling
[1:28:46] now that because you see Hannah wasn't
[1:28:49] just to bring forth fruit that fruit had
[1:28:52] a purpose that fruit that life that came
[1:28:55] out of hannnah that life had a reason to
[1:28:59] live that life that Samuel did great
[1:29:02] things and the greatest thing from my
[1:29:05] understanding is that he anointed David
[1:29:08] King so Hanah as an individual now she
[1:29:12] brought forth a life now catch this
[1:29:14] think very deeply here she brought forth
[1:29:17] a life that anointed David King and
[1:29:22] we're going to get we're going to go
[1:29:23] right up to Hebron the whole nation
[1:29:25] anointed David
[1:29:26] King now that is awesome because there
[1:29:29] is a unification of the nation but it's
[1:29:32] because it's not enough for one or two
[1:29:34] or six or whatever just individuals for
[1:29:38] them to anoint David King it has to be
[1:29:41] everybody and until everybody comes
[1:29:44] together and catches that vision and
[1:29:46] meets the high priest and becomes
[1:29:48] fruitful the complete inheritance cannot
[1:29:51] be attained that's right because because
[1:29:54] it's not attained until the whole nation
[1:29:56] is ready until the whole nation has
[1:29:58] anointed David King they come together
[1:30:00] and we'll go into that a bit later but I
[1:30:01] thought I'll drop that there because
[1:30:03] it's there's it'll it'll release its SE
[1:30:05] now and we can preach on it a little bit
[1:30:08] later on where did Hannah get her
[1:30:11] inspiration you know and this is where
[1:30:13] we can get this inspiration I want to
[1:30:14] encourage
[1:30:16] you God wrote the Bible with people he
[1:30:21] didn't these people someone yes they
[1:30:24] pinned it down and wrote the history but
[1:30:26] that's all they did they just wrote the
[1:30:27] history but the actual Bible was written
[1:30:30] with these people's lives they lived a
[1:30:34] life and they didn't try they didn't
[1:30:36] just make it all happen and do this oh I
[1:30:37] got to do this now this is my queue I
[1:30:39] got to come in here and say this and be
[1:30:41] there God said no they lived a natural
[1:30:45] life they worshiped God they had Faith
[1:30:48] they had to have faith because that's
[1:30:51] what Bible says by faith they did this
[1:30:53] by Faith by faith by faith they believed
[1:30:56] and God then could use that Faith to
[1:30:59] lead them guide them and and so you see
[1:31:04] the whole Bible was written by people
[1:31:08] just living a normal life people walking
[1:31:11] talking doing worshiping whatever they
[1:31:13] did they wrote they were writing
[1:31:16] scriptures and God pended all down and
[1:31:19] you know how accurate that was how
[1:31:21] accurate that those lives would test
[1:31:23] testify of the perfect prophecy of what
[1:31:26] is happening today only God can do that
[1:31:30] but you see contained in their lives for
[1:31:32] us as hanners that have been uh
[1:31:36] privileged to receive the open book to
[1:31:40] receive the revelation of the Seven
[1:31:41] Seals to receive the fullness of God in
[1:31:44] this hour come down where God would open
[1:31:46] his book to you he didn't when he opened
[1:31:49] the book he opened Tamar's life he
[1:31:52] opened Sarah's life life he opened all
[1:31:55] these books of life that was written by
[1:31:57] these people that God wrote he opened
[1:32:00] their lives and contained therein was
[1:32:03] rapturing Faith Hallelujah contained in
[1:32:06] those lives was Faith contained in those
[1:32:08] lives was your identity Hallelujah
[1:32:11] because they're part of the land that
[1:32:12] you're you're laying hold of that's
[1:32:15] already within you amen they walk that
[1:32:18] natural land and you've got that
[1:32:19] spiritually in you and so all those
[1:32:22] lives was open so that you and me could
[1:32:26] read them and be encouraged by them and
[1:32:28] you see now Hannah would have known
[1:32:29] those stories and she would have held to
[1:32:31] those story she would have said no but
[1:32:33] you see Rebecca she was Barren for so
[1:32:35] long and she believed God and God gave
[1:32:38] her a baby amen and Tamar you know you
[1:32:40] see Tamar was an interesting story but
[1:32:42] you that's a powerful story there Tamar
[1:32:45] you see she she had to have a baby amen
[1:32:48] she tried to have a baby of judah's son
[1:32:49] and then the next son and the next son
[1:32:50] and they something was trying to stop
[1:32:53] the king's lineage from coming forth
[1:32:55] something was trying to stop the lineage
[1:32:56] of Christ from being manifested but her
[1:32:59] faith rose up within Tamar's life and
[1:33:01] she couldn't help herself she had to do
[1:33:03] something she got desperate Hallelujah
[1:33:05] and she she did everything in her power
[1:33:07] to make sure that she had a son
[1:33:09] Hallelujah that she could have a baby
[1:33:12] amen and so she believed something rose
[1:33:15] up within her because that lineage must
[1:33:17] come forth Hallelujah and I believe that
[1:33:20] Hannah was encouraged by these stories
[1:33:22] and that you see something she knew that
[1:33:24] there was a living God in Israel she
[1:33:26] knew that he had answered prayers she
[1:33:28] knew that he had taken woman away from
[1:33:30] being Barren and couldn't have a baby
[1:33:32] and she had given and and she knew God
[1:33:34] would hear her prayer so she got serious
[1:33:36] with God because she wanted to be
[1:33:38] fruitful and I believe she got her
[1:33:40] encouragement from there and you can too
[1:33:42] you can get your encouragement from the
[1:33:44] story because you see what God did then
[1:33:47] he'll do for you today amen you just
[1:33:50] believe Hallelujah just have faith the
[1:33:52] devil will try everything he can to try
[1:33:54] and make you not believe it he'll throw
[1:33:56] doubts at you like you wouldn't believe
[1:33:58] that's right but you just resist those
[1:34:00] doubts you just cast those doubts aside
[1:34:03] when a negative thought comes in here
[1:34:04] you cast it aside every time yes it gets
[1:34:07] a bit worrisome it gets a bit tiresome
[1:34:10] sometimes sometimes you get attacked all
[1:34:12] day long never give up amen never give
[1:34:15] up because those days that you're
[1:34:18] getting attacked all day long could be
[1:34:20] the day where a great Victory is waiting
[1:34:21] for you at the temple Hallelujah you can
[1:34:24] be a fruitful person and no longer a Pew
[1:34:26] warmer amen hallelujah glory to God
[1:34:32] Amen Hannah wanted the reality amen she
[1:34:36] was sick of warming a Pew it was time to
[1:34:38] mean business and get her heart in line
[1:34:40] with the true visitation of the high
[1:34:42] priest she had to act upon her faith she
[1:34:46] couldn't just have faith faith without
[1:34:48] works is
[1:34:49] dead we can't just sit there and have
[1:34:52] faith
[1:34:54] it's not it if you're just sitting there
[1:34:56] and you have faith and you say you
[1:34:57] believe that faith is incomplete it's
[1:35:00] hope because real faith will generate a
[1:35:03] true work of God it will bring forth
[1:35:06] fruits Hallelujah 30600 it'll bring
[1:35:10] forth fruit Hallelujah and we will
[1:35:13] manifest one of those things and I
[1:35:14] believe now this is just me but I
[1:35:16] believe that your your level of fruit is
[1:35:19] not is not a predestined thing even
[1:35:20] though God for knows it I believe that
[1:35:23] that's how what you do with the word
[1:35:25] it's how you react to the word it's how
[1:35:27] it's what you do with the word that's
[1:35:29] been revealed to you and you can choose
[1:35:31] now how much you're going to do for the
[1:35:33] Lord you can choose that you can be one
[1:35:36] of those people that God has to poke and
[1:35:38] completely like give you a supernatural
[1:35:40] thing to show you something or you can
[1:35:41] just take the word with what it says and
[1:35:44] do it and start acting upon it and see
[1:35:46] something and go Lord give me a burden
[1:35:48] for that and go out there and do it
[1:35:50] Hallelujah and once you start doing that
[1:35:51] the ball starts rolling you start
[1:35:53] becoming more like him you start going
[1:35:55] through greater trials and your
[1:35:56] character becomes more and then he
[1:35:58] entrusts you with more of the land amen
[1:36:01] because you've got the maturity to
[1:36:02] handle your inheritance that maturity
[1:36:05] comes from trials that maturity comes
[1:36:07] from Hard Times
[1:36:10] hardship oh
[1:36:11] my glory to his name glory to his
[1:36:16] name so that life that Hannah brought
[1:36:20] forth that life anointed David King that
[1:36:23] life the spirit of Prophecy Samuel but
[1:36:27] it wasn't enough for Samuel alone it
[1:36:32] wasn't enough for Hannah alone there had
[1:36:34] to come A Vision amen and so you see and
[1:36:37] this is how God works sometimes that
[1:36:41] Vision starts off with something that
[1:36:44] seems to be completely
[1:36:46] opposite and God gave Israel the desire
[1:36:49] of their heart and and gave them Soul as
[1:36:51] a King instead of his perfect will which
[1:36:53] was David because you see now that life
[1:36:57] that King that needs to be anointed is
[1:36:59] going to rise to power he's going to
[1:37:01] have to rise to power and meekness he's
[1:37:03] going to be an example of that life that
[1:37:06] you bring forth to show us something
[1:37:09] there a great lesson that when that life
[1:37:12] starts to come forth in you you do not
[1:37:15] need to make it do anything you do not
[1:37:18] need to try and put it in its position
[1:37:20] you do not need to try and kill the soul
[1:37:22] that may be in your life
[1:37:24] thank you
[1:37:26] Lord God don't don't touch God's
[1:37:30] anointed you don't not need to do that
[1:37:33] that life has got a life of its own it
[1:37:35] will rise Hannah will rise up Hallelujah
[1:37:38] it might start with just a little prayer
[1:37:40] but that's the beginning it might start
[1:37:42] with just a little time but that's the
[1:37:44] beginning Hallelujah there is a great
[1:37:46] thing that's going to rise and rise and
[1:37:49] rise and continue on until finally
[1:37:51] here's David that's been anointed and he
[1:37:53] starts to rise up when you have anointed
[1:37:55] him king of your heart now it's not by
[1:37:58] what you say as much as yes confessions
[1:38:01] good we don't want to eradicate
[1:38:03] confession because I've just preached
[1:38:05] almost eight series eight sermons on it
[1:38:08] but confession is good don't get me
[1:38:10] wrong but it's not just by what you say
[1:38:13] it's mainly by what your life says amen
[1:38:17] that's what is the voice that anoints
[1:38:18] David King that's the testimony of Jesus
[1:38:21] Christ not just coming out of here
[1:38:24] that's just to exert the authority of
[1:38:25] what's already in here amen but the
[1:38:28] reality the Thunder the thing that hurts
[1:38:30] the devil is the life that's lived
[1:38:33] what's on display amen and I don't mean
[1:38:36] just on Sunday and Wednesday I mean
[1:38:39] every day every day that life on display
[1:38:42] every day that's the thing that hurts
[1:38:44] the enemy Hallelujah now David being
[1:38:47] anointed this king and you start to see
[1:38:51] the fruit come in your life because
[1:38:52] you've met the high priest and that
[1:38:54] fruit and you can see it generating and
[1:38:56] things happening and a desire and a
[1:38:58] burden and all those things and there
[1:39:00] may be a saw that comes because the lord
[1:39:02] always does these things to test you to
[1:39:05] see whether you are going to operate
[1:39:07] your gift amen or see whether you're
[1:39:09] going to allow God to bring it to its
[1:39:10] position and operate it himself that's
[1:39:13] the way and you see now David after he
[1:39:16] was anointed king 12 I don't know how
[1:39:18] old he was but he was
[1:39:19] young he's anointed king and the spirit
[1:39:22] of God was with him from that
[1:39:24] and he went on his journey and he killed
[1:39:26] this bear and he killed a lion and he
[1:39:29] had
[1:39:29] Faith but you see even after he killed
[1:39:32] Goliath and the people started rallying
[1:39:34] around the gift he never put himself in
[1:39:37] his own position that God had ordain for
[1:39:39] him that's patience that's why we run
[1:39:42] this race with patience because there is
[1:39:46] a balance yes we want to be doing yes we
[1:39:48] want to be acting yes we want to be
[1:39:50] working with the Lord and doing the
[1:39:52] things of God but there's also a balance
[1:39:54] of Lord Place me Lord where is it Lord
[1:39:59] let me not try and force my way into
[1:40:02] anything but Lord you placed me you've
[1:40:04] anointed me to be this you know to my
[1:40:08] position as a king and priest yes
[1:40:10] because that life that Hannah brought
[1:40:13] forth and came out and became Samuel and
[1:40:15] then anointed David King that life and
[1:40:18] the whole process happens within your
[1:40:19] own heart it happens within you yes and
[1:40:22] that start to rise up within you and I'm
[1:40:24] sure I'm speaking to people here that
[1:40:26] have experiencing this that are
[1:40:28] experiencing David rising in the heart
[1:40:31] amen that have anointed David King
[1:40:33] hallelujah amen because you see you know
[1:40:36] when you first and we we're just going
[1:40:38] to go right back now we're going to go
[1:40:40] back to the time of
[1:40:41] Joshua and we're going to remember this
[1:40:44] that Joshua when they crossed over
[1:40:46] Jordan was like the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:47] Spirit to us but when you get baptized
[1:40:49] with the Holy Spirit that's only the
[1:40:50] beginning of your journey you're just a
[1:40:52] little B Hallelujah just a little baby
[1:40:56] and there's so many enemies all around
[1:40:59] so many troubles and all these things
[1:41:00] and you realize my that's only the
[1:41:03] beginning but you have something within
[1:41:05] you you have a seed of Faith within you
[1:41:07] you have that down payment within you
[1:41:09] that token life Hallelujah and that's
[1:41:11] that that little white button that you
[1:41:13] get Hallelujah brother brandom says it's
[1:41:15] like a little white button and it's like
[1:41:17] that's a light like a little round thing
[1:41:19] and it comes inside you oops comes
[1:41:21] inside your heart
[1:41:23] and it pushes and you feed on the word
[1:41:26] and you feed on the word and you
[1:41:27] continue feeding on the word and you
[1:41:28] worship and you water it and you give it
[1:41:30] some light and sunshine and eventually
[1:41:33] that spirit of God Amen takes over your
[1:41:35] whole life and it pushes you like the
[1:41:38] grain you know and it pushes out the
[1:41:40] grain the wheat grain and it pushes out
[1:41:42] and it takes all the husks and Shu and
[1:41:43] it pushes them off amen until you until
[1:41:48] until you can come to a place now where
[1:41:50] your life anoints David King yes amen so
[1:41:55] what I'm talking about is not the
[1:41:56] baptism of the Holy Spirit here I'm
[1:41:58] talking about the end of your faith I'm
[1:42:00] talking about where we are at as a as a
[1:42:02] as an age individuals might still be in
[1:42:05] Egypt we got to go get them individuals
[1:42:08] might still be at kades barer about to
[1:42:10] die and get the Holy Ghost individuals
[1:42:12] might be you know got the Holy Ghost and
[1:42:15] they've still got lots of stuff to go on
[1:42:16] and we've got lots of stuff to go on but
[1:42:18] you see the age the the time the Rapture
[1:42:21] the Millennium and all those things
[1:42:23] right at the door and so you see as
[1:42:25] individuals we're now posed with a
[1:42:28] opportunity yes to meet that high priest
[1:42:32] to get a word from him so that we can
[1:42:34] become fruitful amen hallelujah and not
[1:42:37] just sit on a Pew brother brandom said
[1:42:39] and I shouldn't just say brother brandom
[1:42:41] said all the time but I like it okay
[1:42:42] because it's just easier I could take it
[1:42:44] back to the word he said that you no
[1:42:48] actually let's just wait we'll wait for
[1:42:51] that one
[1:42:53] CU important I think it's important I
[1:42:55] just go through this
[1:42:58] first yes let's go through this first
[1:43:01] just wait when the nation
[1:43:05] now from Joshua and the Holy Spirit when
[1:43:09] they got the Holy Spirit and they were
[1:43:10] here they are in the land and there's
[1:43:12] all the enemies that are rallying around
[1:43:17] them and you see God said I will not
[1:43:22] give you all that land until you've got
[1:43:23] the
[1:43:24] maturity and you see now when they get
[1:43:28] the maturity you'll inherit the
[1:43:31] land I'll give you another little piece
[1:43:34] when you get the maturity and it's the
[1:43:36] same with
[1:43:37] us you cannot get all of your
[1:43:40] inheritance at once even though all your
[1:43:42] inheritance is already in when you've
[1:43:44] got the Holy Spirit but you can't have
[1:43:46] access to it all at once because you
[1:43:49] won't have the character to handle you
[1:43:51] might get a bit angry one day and fly
[1:43:53] off the handle and say something and
[1:43:54] then it will change the world because
[1:43:56] that power to change the world that
[1:43:59] power of God that spoke worlds into
[1:44:02] existence is actually your
[1:44:05] inheritance and imagine having all of
[1:44:07] that and yes you do it's and within you
[1:44:09] already that power but having access to
[1:44:12] it all but there's some hard trials to
[1:44:15] go through because David you know they
[1:44:18] went through all of that until finally
[1:44:21] they went through the time of judges
[1:44:23] and then Hannah comes on the scene and
[1:44:25] here's David and she's got to anoint
[1:44:27] David
[1:44:29] King and sorry Samuel anoints David King
[1:44:32] and David now rises in meekness to his
[1:44:36] position that's a long process they
[1:44:40] waited 400 years from the time of Joshua
[1:44:44] when Joshua took the people across
[1:44:46] Jordan 400 and something years until
[1:44:49] David was anointed king that's a long
[1:44:51] time
[1:44:54] that's that time has been a bit shorter
[1:44:57] for us it's been 40 years and now 50 but
[1:45:01] 40 years in about
[1:45:03] 200 uh 6 2005 was 40 years that's that's
[1:45:07] right 40 years from the seals being
[1:45:13] opened the the the people of this
[1:45:16] message went through the same thing as
[1:45:18] Israel went
[1:45:19] through but now we as a people are in
[1:45:23] that pivotal position where we can
[1:45:25] choose are we going to remain in that
[1:45:27] way or are we going to forget that old
[1:45:29] Administration and continue now because
[1:45:32] Christ
[1:45:33] himself the stuff that people preached
[1:45:35] about the ministers and the Ministries
[1:45:37] they were preaching good preaching
[1:45:38] nothing wrong with the preaching nothing
[1:45:40] wrong with them and they're all people
[1:45:42] we're all a work in progress the
[1:45:43] ministers were a work in progress
[1:45:45] unfortunately people didn't show their
[1:45:47] own weaknesses a lot and and the image
[1:45:49] that they were portraying was just this
[1:45:51] big put on show and people were really
[1:45:54] so bad and so wrong on the inside
[1:45:57] because they were ruling their spirit
[1:45:58] with malevolence legalism trying to make
[1:46:02] this image happen trying to make the
[1:46:03] children do this and trying to make the
[1:46:05] people do that make the parents do this
[1:46:07] and separating this and doing all this
[1:46:08] stuff to try and en force a Perfection
[1:46:11] upon the people it doesn't work that
[1:46:13] way can't work that way we have to
[1:46:16] forget that way we have to forget the
[1:46:18] way of our fathers naturally speaking
[1:46:21] now the way our parents brought us up
[1:46:22] and not all of us may be like that but
[1:46:24] mine was certain like that I'm sure most
[1:46:26] raised us in a very harsh way never
[1:46:29] spoke good things about us never gave us
[1:46:31] praise or encouragement many people
[1:46:34] because they were raised that way and
[1:46:37] the problem that then that that whole
[1:46:39] model was taken into the ministry and it
[1:46:41] was ministered that way but now we have
[1:46:43] to forget that whole thing and and and
[1:46:46] and if we're suffering from it we need
[1:46:48] to come down and get prayed for yes and
[1:46:50] get healing from it so that our life can
[1:46:53] stop being affected by those old past
[1:46:55] things amen yes amen it's true we need
[1:46:58] to get set free and there is a power in
[1:47:00] this room present today to set you free
[1:47:03] amen absolutely free to heal you of
[1:47:06] those small little things that may
[1:47:07] affect your whole life you can be fully
[1:47:11] completely restored right now healed you
[1:47:13] can be healed in your seat as I'm
[1:47:14] speaking the Holy Ghost is here to heal
[1:47:16] you just ask just ask right now in your
[1:47:20] head in Your Heart Lord heal me I don't
[1:47:24] want to be holding on to the things of
[1:47:25] the past anymore I don't want to hold on
[1:47:28] to those pains and hurts that my parents
[1:47:30] gave me and that Administration the way
[1:47:32] that they brought me up they meant
[1:47:34] well maybe some probably didn't but most
[1:47:37] meant
[1:47:38] well but it's affected you and it's made
[1:47:41] you a certain way and it makes it very
[1:47:42] hard for you to communicate and whatever
[1:47:45] with people you can be healed right now
[1:47:48] you can be healed in your seat amen if
[1:47:50] it's been identified and you know it you
[1:47:52] know what it is that's affected you all
[1:47:54] your life you can be healed of it right
[1:47:56] now just pray right now you can pray you
[1:47:59] can believe now it can leave you that
[1:48:03] that scar that pain cuz he's here to
[1:48:05] bind up the he breach of his people and
[1:48:07] heal the stroke of your wounds that's
[1:48:09] right all of them that's right cuz he
[1:48:11] wants that so that you can in your life
[1:48:14] your life not just what you say and what
[1:48:15] you sing on Sunday but your life can
[1:48:18] anoint David King so that your life can
[1:48:21] actually do it not because you're trying
[1:48:24] to make it happen like the old judges
[1:48:25] way the old Administration but the new
[1:48:28] administration because you see what was
[1:48:31] preached about that image that was
[1:48:32] preached and the opening of the word and
[1:48:34] the Mysteries and the the great mind of
[1:48:36] Christ to come down on the people one
[1:48:38] day becomes flesh amen we're in that day
[1:48:42] we're in that day yes we're here where
[1:48:45] what was preached about is becoming
[1:48:46] flesh now you can choose amen you can
[1:48:50] choose now and the gift uh we we take it
[1:48:54] back now because you see we're humans
[1:48:56] but within each one of us when that life
[1:48:58] comes forth within each one of us as
[1:49:01] gifts talents that God has given us he's
[1:49:04] given us a talent or
[1:49:06] talents that's when that gets anointed
[1:49:10] by the age anointed by God and what he's
[1:49:13] doing now when the I am that spoke to
[1:49:18] Abraham I am that I am comes to that my
[1:49:22] this is is deep this is real deep yes
[1:49:24] but this is real real for us when the I
[1:49:27] am comes to that
[1:49:29] gift if you really yield that gift and
[1:49:32] the complexes and the pains that
[1:49:33] surround that gift can be dealt with
[1:49:36] then it's really going to be the
[1:49:38] fullness of Christ operating and so you
[1:49:42] can see pastors that are raising up now
[1:49:44] are pastoring very different from the
[1:49:47] pastors that just as much in this
[1:49:49] message and bride and what back in the
[1:49:52] day
[1:49:53] different why because they were
[1:49:56] operating their gift in the age that it
[1:49:58] was there but there's and I declare that
[1:50:00] there has been a change amen there has
[1:50:03] been a change and I and and only by the
[1:50:06] fruit and by what we're looking at and
[1:50:08] what we're seeing because a tree is
[1:50:09] known by its fruit and the fruit of the
[1:50:12] ministry is changing the gifts are
[1:50:14] operating different the parenting is
[1:50:17] parenting different the gift of Father
[1:50:19] the talent of mother is operating
[1:50:22] different than it used to be and it's
[1:50:24] not because we're any better we haven't
[1:50:26] done anything more other than we're
[1:50:28] receiving the ministry as we're actually
[1:50:29] being ministered an entrance into the
[1:50:33] perfect will of God Amen we're being
[1:50:35] ministered true instruction and
[1:50:38] righteousness amen a more perfect way a
[1:50:40] more complete way of parenting a more
[1:50:42] complete way of living a more complete
[1:50:45] way of pastoring a more complete way of
[1:50:47] evangelizing a more complete way of
[1:50:49] teaching a more complete way of
[1:50:51] apostolic missionary a more complete
[1:50:54] way of
[1:50:56] life not because we're any better or
[1:50:59] done anything more or fasted more we
[1:51:01] probably fasted less definitely fasted
[1:51:03] less we're not you know those days they
[1:51:06] were hardworking people they were Ardent
[1:51:08] men and women that just they were strong
[1:51:11] in faith they were at every service they
[1:51:13] never missed a beat amen but the
[1:51:15] administration wasn't complete because
[1:51:18] the the the fullness they were preaching
[1:51:20] it and it was coming out of the the
[1:51:22] spirit and yes the Divine intelligence
[1:51:25] would come and they were preaching the
[1:51:27] Mysteries and the book and all those
[1:51:29] things but there has to come a time when
[1:51:31] what's being preached puts on flesh and
[1:51:34] we are in that time Saints we are in
[1:51:37] that time and we can make a decision am
[1:51:39] I going to continue in the old
[1:51:40] Administration or am I going to walk
[1:51:42] into the new administration of the king
[1:51:46] the true headship who's come to the body
[1:51:50] the true headship is here hallelujah
[1:51:53] Christ himself and now my life and let
[1:51:55] my life anoint him King Hallelujah let
[1:51:57] that be your testimony let that be your
[1:51:59] prayer let my life anoint him king
[1:52:02] that's right not just by what I say cuz
[1:52:04] that words can be very cheap but the
[1:52:06] life the fruit the reality what's on
[1:52:09] display is what's really important
[1:52:11] that's got the the dollar value the gold
[1:52:13] dollar behind it amen come on that
[1:52:17] separates the the wood and the the the
[1:52:20] chips from the gold and the silver amen
[1:52:22] amen is what the life is
[1:52:25] hallelujah amen hallelujah because
[1:52:28] that's the high calling that we've been
[1:52:30] called to hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:52:34] let's just read now from 2 Samuel chap 5
[1:52:37] verse 1-3 you can turn there if you like
[1:52:39] or you can just follow along with me
[1:52:40] here and this is the unification of the
[1:52:43] holy nation of Israel Hannah's Revival
[1:52:46] spreads to become a national Vision
[1:52:50] Hallelujah
[1:52:52] a people because you see now where the
[1:52:55] old
[1:52:56] Administration is and and this is and
[1:52:58] don't get me wrong there is definitely
[1:53:01] the will of God to have a pastor in the
[1:53:03] church and a local body right amen but
[1:53:05] the old Administration is it's like me
[1:53:08] and us and you guys just stay away you
[1:53:10] might infect us with some funny Doctrine
[1:53:12] but there is an actual when the head
[1:53:14] comes when the headship comes he is the
[1:53:17] Divine Shepherd Hallelujah he can bring
[1:53:20] the unity Hallelujah and so you see now
[1:53:23] us as a as a responsibility as a
[1:53:25] stewardship let's anoint him king of our
[1:53:27] life let's see what happens when the
[1:53:29] local body comes together and anoint
[1:53:31] some king that's right gets really
[1:53:32] serious really sincere amen hallelujah
[1:53:37] hallelujah and really convicted about it
[1:53:40] do you know an Ardent conviction this is
[1:53:43] Christianity this is this is what I do
[1:53:45] this is what we do we become rugged we
[1:53:48] can learn from the old school the old
[1:53:51] school as much as we want to say how
[1:53:53] wrong everything was and what not
[1:53:55] because hindsight's a great thing you
[1:53:57] see and they were they were in the in
[1:53:59] the will of God they were going
[1:54:01] according to the program the program was
[1:54:02] there the administration was different
[1:54:04] but we have an
[1:54:08] opportunity to learn from them also that
[1:54:12] they were
[1:54:13] stalwart
[1:54:14] rugged they were conviction they had
[1:54:17] real conviction about their
[1:54:19] Christianity K were committed
[1:54:22] and they were they they were they stood
[1:54:24] for what they believed they were strong
[1:54:27] minded and too strong actually in some
[1:54:29] places because that's what caused all
[1:54:30] the divisions and the and the but we can
[1:54:33] learn from that and not get too casual
[1:54:36] with our law of Liberty cuz yes we have
[1:54:40] Liberty and yes the administration's
[1:54:41] changing because you see the Pastors in
[1:54:44] this day are
[1:54:46] allowing God to mature the people rather
[1:54:49] than them for forcing it upon the people
[1:54:51] but we can't take advantage of that
[1:54:53] that's right we don't take advantage of
[1:54:55] that we have to actually have that
[1:54:57] conviction that's right Hallelujah God
[1:55:00] loves that he loves someone that makes a
[1:55:02] decision and that's it amen when it's
[1:55:05] right of course I don't want to make a
[1:55:07] wrong decision and that's it you know we
[1:55:09] have to we have to have a comma there
[1:55:11] you know because sometimes we've made a
[1:55:13] wrong decision and we say that's it and
[1:55:15] then that's not it amen so we have to be
[1:55:18] we have to be Discerning and and we
[1:55:19] always have to have the right nature
[1:55:21] about us because you see if you lose
[1:55:23] your lamb nature and become a lion all
[1:55:25] the
[1:55:26] time if you lose that lamb nature the
[1:55:28] dove can't lead you the dove scared of
[1:55:30] you that Tim and Dove and it sounds a
[1:55:33] bit weird that the Holy Ghost would be
[1:55:34] scared of you he's not scared of you he
[1:55:36] he could destroy the whole earth in a
[1:55:37] minute and a second
[1:55:39] but the timidity of that Holy Ghost if
[1:55:43] you lose your lamb nature and keep going
[1:55:44] in your line cuz we are a lamb and a
[1:55:46] lion as well you know we can there are
[1:55:48] times where the lion comes out you know
[1:55:51] when you're having a you're talking to
[1:55:52] somebody or you're fighting the enemy
[1:55:55] that's right the lion might need to come
[1:55:56] out yeah but the lamb needs to be out
[1:56:00] you need to walk as a lamb nature that's
[1:56:03] right sensitive yes a nature that God
[1:56:06] can lead yes maleable in the hands of
[1:56:09] God hey let's get to the scripture here
[1:56:11] because see more Believers want to
[1:56:13] anoint the same life as Samuel anointed
[1:56:18] king so it says here in 2 Samuel 5: 1-3
[1:56:21] it says
[1:56:22] then came all the tribes of Israel to
[1:56:24] David unto Hebron and spake saying
[1:56:28] behold we are thy bone and thy flesh
[1:56:31] also in time pass when Saul was King
[1:56:33] over us thou was he that lest out and
[1:56:36] broughtest in Israel and the Lord said
[1:56:38] to thee Thou shalt Feed My People Israel
[1:56:41] and thou shalt be a captain over Israel
[1:56:44] so all the Elders of Israel came to the
[1:56:47] king to heon and King David made a
[1:56:50] league with them in Hebron before the
[1:56:52] Lord and they anointed David King over
[1:56:57] Israel this was the
[1:57:00] coronation of of for us now this is the
[1:57:03] coronation of Jesus in our
[1:57:07] heart and like I just said when we all
[1:57:10] come together and anoint him
[1:57:12] King you Watch What Happens because the
[1:57:15] purpose of all this and the title of my
[1:57:16] sermon is driving out the jebusite and
[1:57:19] we're going to read now because here
[1:57:22] this is the very
[1:57:25] occasion that actually brought to pass
[1:57:27] everything that Joshua promised
[1:57:29] everything that Joshua gave to them who
[1:57:32] knows the word Beque it means to give
[1:57:35] the
[1:57:35] inheritance Joshua was anointed and he
[1:57:38] he preached the message the message he
[1:57:40] preaches was all the land and he says
[1:57:42] here's yours and yours and place the
[1:57:45] people but now here the event takes
[1:57:48] place where the final frontier is going
[1:57:51] to be conquered yes amen and we all have
[1:57:55] a
[1:57:56] jebusite you know what that name
[1:57:58] jebusite means to trample and to
[1:58:03] thresh and there's something in each one
[1:58:05] of our
[1:58:08] Lives some people call it the right
[1:58:10] punch from the enemy he's got one on
[1:58:13] each one of us one weakness and
[1:58:15] sometimes there's other ones as well
[1:58:17] that you've allowed in but there's
[1:58:18] always this one thing that's your
[1:58:21] jebusite
[1:58:23] that
[1:58:24] jebusite is going to die that jebusite
[1:58:27] is going to be conquered yes hallelujah
[1:58:31] amen that jebusite has got an expiry
[1:58:34] date amen and yes that jebusite might
[1:58:37] put some um special needs people out the
[1:58:40] front to mock you sometimes
[1:58:43] amen like they did with David they put
[1:58:46] all the special needs people out there
[1:58:48] to say ah you can't get in here but
[1:58:51] David was anointed see David had the
[1:58:54] anointing he's the king he can do
[1:58:55] anything yes Hallelujah nothing can
[1:58:57] stand before him but Israel wasn't
[1:58:59] access to that power until they anointed
[1:59:01] him King Hallelujah and you're not
[1:59:04] access to that power until your life
[1:59:05] anoints David King amen amen cuz he
[1:59:08] can't and your life you can say anything
[1:59:11] you like and and you can confess
[1:59:13] anything you like but until that reality
[1:59:15] is in your subconscious until that faith
[1:59:18] is really down there and dropped into
[1:59:19] your subconscious it's all Tau
[1:59:22] it's all hope and there's nothing wrong
[1:59:24] with hope don't get me wrong we there's
[1:59:27] things that we're hoping for as
[1:59:28] individuals there's scriptures that we
[1:59:30] see and promises that we like and then
[1:59:32] we're hoping that's right you know what
[1:59:33] hope is it's an expectation an
[1:59:35] anticipation with pleasure amen because
[1:59:38] you know it's yours you know it's yours
[1:59:40] and you're holding on to it one day that
[1:59:43] hope will be
[1:59:46] substantiated because faith is the
[1:59:49] substance of things hoped for
[1:59:52] Faith substantiates your hope amen so
[1:59:57] there's nothing wrong with hope don't
[1:59:58] get down on the fact that you may be
[2:00:00] hoping so Hallelujah stay hoping so
[2:00:02] until you get to substantiation until
[2:00:05] God comes on the scene Hallelujah that
[2:00:07] high priest and he says have it it's
[2:00:10] yours I grant you the desire of your
[2:00:12] heart and he speaks it to you and it
[2:00:15] becomes a reality
[2:00:17] amen
[2:00:19] hallelujah are you with me amen amen
[2:00:22] amen praise the
[2:00:26] Lord so David now they didn't have
[2:00:29] access to this Israel didn't have access
[2:00:31] to Joshua yes they did in one sense of
[2:00:33] course don't get me wrong they did have
[2:00:35] access Joshua preached it and the mighty
[2:00:38] Captain was there and he would drive out
[2:00:40] the inheritance but what did Israel do
[2:00:42] they went off on another way they forgot
[2:00:45] about these things the administration of
[2:00:47] Egypt and the administration of their
[2:00:49] parents and natural stuff got in the way
[2:00:51] and they started forcing these things
[2:00:53] and doing all the stuff that was not
[2:00:54] really according to the plan of God and
[2:00:57] they started worshiping Baal and they
[2:00:58] started going all on different ways and
[2:01:00] all sorts of worse things happened and
[2:01:02] almost worse well some places that was
[2:01:04] worse than Sodom and Gomorrah and these
[2:01:06] are meant to be the promises children of
[2:01:09] God and they were doing worse than Sodom
[2:01:12] and
[2:01:12] Gomorrah and yes the history in this own
[2:01:15] message has the same testimonies now I'm
[2:01:19] not saying that they're elect because
[2:01:20] yes there's a mixed multitude it comes
[2:01:22] but you see right through it and I
[2:01:24] praise God for this there was ruths and
[2:01:26] rabs and people that went right through
[2:01:28] that time of Judges Hallelujah that
[2:01:31] stayed with God through the whole thing
[2:01:33] it might have been just a few people
[2:01:34] here and there because God was planning
[2:01:37] something he was bringing forth a
[2:01:38] lineage he was waiting for a henna to
[2:01:40] come on the scene amen waiting for a
[2:01:41] henna to rise up Hallelujah waiting for
[2:01:43] someone to hear the voice of Faith
[2:01:45] within them and someone to get serious
[2:01:47] and come to the Altar and get and meet
[2:01:49] the high priest and get a word directly
[2:01:51] from God God so that their life can
[2:01:53] become fruitful so they stop just
[2:01:55] warming a Pew now and actually find
[2:01:57] their purpose for God find their talent
[2:02:01] and what it is and refine it down and
[2:02:03] hone it until they're a well oiled
[2:02:05] machine amen for God cuz each one of us
[2:02:09] has talents yes amen and then that life
[2:02:13] now comes out and flourishes and anoints
[2:02:15] David King giving you access to the
[2:02:19] power of God am giving you access to the
[2:02:22] power that's within David himself the
[2:02:24] king now we're talking about King Jesus
[2:02:26] not just David the natural David but
[2:02:28] Jesus the resurrected Living God the
[2:02:31] almighty Jesus
[2:02:34] Christ when your life anoints him King
[2:02:38] all the power in Heaven and Earth the
[2:02:40] omnipotence of God is manifested in your
[2:02:42] own life because he can trust you
[2:02:48] trustiness Romans 5 let me just quickly
[2:02:50] read there it's not in my script but
[2:02:51] I'll just go to it because it's quite
[2:02:55] it's quite
[2:02:59] good I'm so glad we're good for time
[2:03:02] today praise the
[2:03:03] Lord therefore being justified by faith
[2:03:06] we have peace with God through our Lord
[2:03:08] Jesus Christ by whom also we have access
[2:03:11] by faith into his grace wherein we stand
[2:03:13] and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God
[2:03:16] Amen hope nothing wrong with it you
[2:03:19] stand and rejoice and Hope
[2:03:22] for the glory of God when you look to
[2:03:24] him and he and and every now and again
[2:03:26] he just drops in the Revelation he drops
[2:03:28] in some Faith Hallelujah never stop
[2:03:31] hoping never stop having that attitude
[2:03:33] oh God I need you oh Lord hold the
[2:03:36] scriptures before him hold the verses
[2:03:39] that are for your life before him never
[2:03:42] never never give up always Testify the
[2:03:46] word amen amen and not only so but we
[2:03:50] glory in tribulations and also knowing
[2:03:53] that tribulation worketh patience and
[2:03:56] patience experience that word experience
[2:03:58] is
[2:03:59] trustiness Trustin us it's one thing for
[2:04:03] us to trust God and we can easily trust
[2:04:05] God unless there's complexes that stop
[2:04:07] us from trusting him and if we go
[2:04:08] through those but God can deliver us
[2:04:10] right now but there's another thing for
[2:04:14] God to trust you can God trust you I ask
[2:04:20] myself could God trust me
[2:04:22] and if I look at myself naturally I
[2:04:24] think oh my maybe
[2:04:26] not so you see we we're a work in
[2:04:29] progress amen a work and progress but
[2:04:33] here it is tribulation knowing that
[2:04:36] tribulation worketh patience but you're
[2:04:39] not if you just warm a Pew because this
[2:04:41] is what I'm dealing I'm dealing with the
[2:04:43] initial spoken word of the high priest
[2:04:45] for you so that you can just not just be
[2:04:48] a Pew warmer but you're you're in a
[2:04:51] effective member and part of the
[2:04:53] ministry of God amen amen that your
[2:04:56] talent is actually changing people's
[2:04:57] lives that your talent is winning Souls
[2:05:01] whatever it may
[2:05:03] be if there's prayer Warrior locked up
[2:05:05] in one of you in in some of you and you
[2:05:07] don't know it yet it's time to find out
[2:05:10] what that is it's time to find your
[2:05:11] talents for the Lord you know we spend a
[2:05:14] lot of our life and giving all of our
[2:05:15] talents to the tree of
[2:05:17] knowledge and I I'm not saying that
[2:05:19] there's anything wrong with going to
[2:05:20] work and we and and we we're very
[2:05:23] serious about that brother Ed's been
[2:05:25] finding a job you know you get serious
[2:05:27] about finding work how much more serious
[2:05:30] should we be about finding what God
[2:05:32] wants us to do finding what the talent
[2:05:35] is inside of us and yes we may have a
[2:05:37] vague vague is not enough vague yes if
[2:05:40] you've got a vague and you start putting
[2:05:41] yourself in a certain place and it's not
[2:05:43] quite the exact then it's just only
[2:05:47] going to be slightly effective it's not
[2:05:48] really going to be in its full effect
[2:05:50] cuz it's like a cog in the whole machine
[2:05:52] that's right
[2:05:53] Hallelujah and when all those cogs and
[2:05:55] the whole machine come together you know
[2:05:57] this is when this is Hebron now we're
[2:05:59] we're talking Hebron now the nation
[2:06:01] coming together to anoint David King the
[2:06:04] power that's contained in the very soul
[2:06:07] of God the power that's contained in the
[2:06:09] spirit of God the power that's contained
[2:06:11] in the one that said all power in Heaven
[2:06:13] and Earth is given unto
[2:06:15] me becomes
[2:06:17] ours becomes out but you see now and
[2:06:20] while I was talking about the tent is
[2:06:22] because when you when that Talent comes
[2:06:23] into its place my you will go through
[2:06:26] tribulation for that because now you're
[2:06:29] fighting the enemy directly now you're
[2:06:31] really becoming a threat to him he's
[2:06:33] going to do everything he can to destroy
[2:06:36] you he's going to do everything he can
[2:06:37] to take you on a field take you down a
[2:06:39] path of lust or take you down a path of
[2:06:42] distraction he's going to do everything
[2:06:44] and you're going to be bombarded with
[2:06:46] it my he bombards you before you get
[2:06:50] that and then he bombards you when
[2:06:52] you've got it and then he bombards you
[2:06:54] when your talent's being used more and
[2:06:55] more and more but what now you see we
[2:06:58] don't want to shun that never shun it
[2:07:01] yes intellectually and the flesh is
[2:07:03] always weak the flesh doesn't want to go
[2:07:05] through those things but you've got
[2:07:06] dominion over your flesh that's right
[2:07:08] you've got dominion over your flesh
[2:07:10] don't you listen to what your feelings
[2:07:12] are saying I don't want to go through
[2:07:13] that it's going to be too hard I don't
[2:07:15] want to fight directly against the enemy
[2:07:17] it's going to be too hard I'm going to
[2:07:18] have to go through trials my goodness
[2:07:20] man if you only realized the glory and
[2:07:23] the gold that the trials are amen for
[2:07:26] you to go through all those things so
[2:07:29] that you can have patience and then from
[2:07:31] patience trus in us so that God can
[2:07:33] trust you because when he sees and you
[2:07:36] can try and you cannot pull the W over
[2:07:37] God's eyes you can't just act out a
[2:07:39] whole thing and think God knows and when
[2:07:42] you're ready then you can actually go
[2:07:45] further into your
[2:07:46] inheritance
[2:07:48] amen like I said before you need to hear
[2:07:51] the high priest voice when you've got a
[2:07:53] need when you when you've got a need you
[2:07:57] got to hear the high priest you've got
[2:07:59] to hear him
[2:08:01] speak you've got to hear him now don't
[2:08:05] get me wrong about hearing an audible
[2:08:07] voice because otherwise you know you'll
[2:08:09] end up going on a a journey that may not
[2:08:11] be for you but when he speaks it might
[2:08:13] not just be an audible voice it might be
[2:08:15] a direct Revelation from the word it
[2:08:17] might be just a thought that comes
[2:08:18] directly into your heart whatever way he
[2:08:21] will speak and you will know you will
[2:08:23] know when he speaks to amen so don't try
[2:08:27] and bind yourself to hear the vable
[2:08:28] voice of God because you might be there
[2:08:29] for a long time because God might not
[2:08:31] want to speak to you because we cannot
[2:08:33] see we we're not twisting God's arm here
[2:08:37] we're actually making ourselves
[2:08:38] available for him and when we're serious
[2:08:40] he will
[2:08:41] speak CU he wants us to be in our
[2:08:44] position he wants us to anoint him King
[2:08:47] but like David he's not going to arise
[2:08:49] by force yeah he's going to rise in
[2:08:51] meekness he will never force you to
[2:08:55] become
[2:08:56] anything but he in meekness will rise
[2:08:59] until the soul of your life we're
[2:09:01] changing the whole kind of picture here
[2:09:03] but the soul in your life gets cast off
[2:09:06] the throne amen don't worry it will
[2:09:10] happen don't worry Hallelujah those
[2:09:14] complexes of inferiority will go amen
[2:09:17] amen amen those complexes of soread
[2:09:20] scared of men we'll go I'm so glad of
[2:09:23] that because that's one of the ones that
[2:09:24] I suffered with is the fear of man I
[2:09:26] don't know why I I I can't find why but
[2:09:30] that was one of my ones and you know
[2:09:32] what that's gone Hallelujah by the
[2:09:34] Lord's Grace amen
[2:09:37] hallelujah amen all right I'm going to
[2:09:40] go back to my thing here let's just read
[2:09:43] now from one
[2:09:45] Chronicles sorry no we're going to read
[2:09:48] from 2 Samuel 5: 6:10 this is where gets
[2:09:51] really really
[2:09:53] good so you just need to really be
[2:09:55] thinking now cuz I love this amen it
[2:09:59] says here and the King and his men went
[2:10:02] to Jerusalem unto the
[2:10:04] jebusites that's just basically
[2:10:06] following on from
[2:10:07] before the inhabitants of the land which
[2:10:10] spake unto David saying except thou take
[2:10:13] away the Blind and the lame Thou shalt
[2:10:16] not come in
[2:10:18] here thinking David cannot come in
[2:10:22] hither
[2:10:24] nevertheless I love this now remember
[2:10:27] bring this into the context that now
[2:10:29] Israel has got access to the power
[2:10:31] contained in David yes okay Israel now
[2:10:34] has access to the power and that
[2:10:36] anointing completely yes under Saul
[2:10:38] there was there was some same as your
[2:10:41] life you have some but when this all is
[2:10:44] ruling in the complexes are still there
[2:10:46] the full power of David being anointed
[2:10:48] is not
[2:10:50] right had come into its full power cuz
[2:10:52] he's not enthroned completely even
[2:10:54] though God has made him
[2:10:59] King here he sees David cannot come into
[2:11:02] nevertheless Hallelujah David took the
[2:11:05] stronghold of
[2:11:06] Zion the same as the city of David and
[2:11:09] David said on that day whosoever GTH up
[2:11:12] to the gutter and smiteth the jebusites
[2:11:15] and the lame and the blind that have
[2:11:17] hated of David's Soul he shall be Chief
[2:11:19] and Captain wherefore they said the
[2:11:21] blind and the lame shall not come into
[2:11:23] the house so David dwelt in the fort and
[2:11:26] called it by the city of David and David
[2:11:28] built round about him from Milo and
[2:11:31] Inward and David went on and grew great
[2:11:34] and the Lord God of hosts was with him
[2:11:37] so you see now Hallelujah
[2:11:41] that from David being anointed king and
[2:11:44] Israel gaining access to the power that
[2:11:47] was within that
[2:11:49] anointing now the very final frontier of
[2:11:53] the
[2:11:54] Jerusalem the very heart of Israel the
[2:11:57] place where the throne would be the
[2:12:00] temple the soul of Israel would be
[2:12:04] conquered because those jebusites that
[2:12:06] trampled down in the
[2:12:08] threshing threshed and threshed and
[2:12:11] threshed and they were the ones that
[2:12:12] held on the longest but when David was
[2:12:14] anointed king that final push that final
[2:12:18] anointing to conquer that right punch
[2:12:20] that punch ing you all your
[2:12:22] life can be dealt with amen can be
[2:12:25] delivered those enemies can be destroyed
[2:12:28] and he comes up through the the gutter
[2:12:30] the Honan tunnels and I walk through
[2:12:31] those tunnels and you see now this is
[2:12:34] where it comes into to be glorious here
[2:12:37] you know the Great Captain that was
[2:12:38] introduced to them when they crossed
[2:12:39] over Jordan you know the mighty angel
[2:12:42] that descended down in the middle of
[2:12:43] this mystery Babylon with the open book
[2:12:46] that Captain the captain of the host yes
[2:12:49] it was the captain of The Host that went
[2:12:51] through the tunnels to open Jerusalem
[2:12:55] and it's that Captain it's that book
[2:12:57] it's that Feast that you're feeding on
[2:12:59] at the king's table amen by the grace of
[2:13:01] God like
[2:13:03] Mish feasting amen at the king's table
[2:13:07] and yes they said that the lame and Hal
[2:13:09] couldn't come in but there was a Grace
[2:13:11] from AEF amen there was a Grace that a
[2:13:13] lame man could come and sit and feast
[2:13:15] until you know he was look just like the
[2:13:17] rest amen hallelujah at the king's table
[2:13:22] amen and you see that Captain is the one
[2:13:26] in that book that you're feeding off
[2:13:27] that open word that's why I say you're
[2:13:31] so important to read the message to
[2:13:33] listen to the message get that message
[2:13:35] on listen to sermons make sure you do
[2:13:39] your flesh is going to tell you no I'm
[2:13:41] too busy your spirit's going to
[2:13:43] definitely say no no no reason reason
[2:13:46] reason but your soul is going to say yes
[2:13:49] your soul is going to make the decision
[2:13:51] not your spirit don't let your spirit
[2:13:54] rule your life amen don't let your flesh
[2:13:56] rule your
[2:13:58] life you rule it for he that has no
[2:14:01] control over his own spirit is like a
[2:14:03] City built Without Walls amen and the
[2:14:06] captain of the enemy's host will come in
[2:14:08] to your hesm monian tunnels and come up
[2:14:10] and destroy you and let Satan into your
[2:14:13] heart so you don't want that now I'm not
[2:14:17] speaking to people that are sealed but
[2:14:20] you know what I mean
[2:14:21] you don't want to let Satan influence
[2:14:23] you you don't want to let Satan in
[2:14:25] anywhere because if you give him an in
[2:14:26] you'll take a mile that's right so you
[2:14:29] want to be now allowing access to the
[2:14:32] Divine Captain you want to be giving him
[2:14:34] access Hallelujah to your life amen by
[2:14:39] anointing David King because once
[2:14:40] David's anointed king that captain now
[2:14:43] the captain now Naturally Speaking he
[2:14:44] came on the scene and he went an open
[2:14:46] and now read this in one Chronicles he
[2:14:47] says and David dwelt in the castle
[2:14:49] hallelujah what was David doing amen
[2:14:53] David rebuilt I just read it therefore
[2:14:55] they called it the city of David and he
[2:14:57] built the city round about even from
[2:14:59] Millow round about and joab now the
[2:15:01] captain of the host repaired the rest of
[2:15:04] the city you see now when you let the
[2:15:06] captain in and you start feeding on that
[2:15:08] word your city is being repaired
[2:15:11] Hallelujah your Jerusalem is being
[2:15:13] rebuilt amen he is rebuilding your life
[2:15:17] those tapes are rebuilding your life
[2:15:20] you're not just sharing information and
[2:15:22] you might listen to them 10 times and
[2:15:24] you're getting rebuilt 10 times
[2:15:26] Hallelujah if you can just have the
[2:15:28] faith and you can receive them in the
[2:15:30] spirit they were given if you can
[2:15:32] recognize what is being spoken what has
[2:15:35] been recorded onto magnetic tape and
[2:15:37] caught up in that fourth dimension for
[2:15:40] you to listen to when you can sit there
[2:15:42] and go my I am not just listening to a
[2:15:44] seventh grade Kentucky I'm listening to
[2:15:46] the voice of God that's speaking to me
[2:15:49] and it's rebuilding my Jerusalem
[2:15:51] it's rebuilding me and it's really David
[2:15:55] dwells in this castle and you see he
[2:15:57] rebuilt the city of David what was he
[2:16:00] doing he was rebuilding he was building
[2:16:02] up the palace because there's a queen
[2:16:04] that's going to come there's going to be
[2:16:07] a people you see when your life can
[2:16:09] anoint David King it doesn't just stop
[2:16:11] there you don't just conquer the
[2:16:14] jebusites but you're getting prepared
[2:16:16] for queenship you're getting prepared
[2:16:19] like B Sheba
[2:16:21] amen who brought forth the son of David
[2:16:24] amen yes the story has a negative tone
[2:16:27] but we're looking at it prophetically
[2:16:29] now because you see God bypasses the
[2:16:31] natural sometimes to show you a
[2:16:33] prophetic message a prophetic story that
[2:16:36] a nation anointed the true king king the
[2:16:40] power of God came into the nation and
[2:16:42] rebuilt Jerusalem rebuilt the soul
[2:16:44] rebuilt the people rebuilt the palace
[2:16:48] ready for the king and queen to come to
[2:16:51] together why why does the king and queen
[2:16:53] need to come together because a life
[2:16:55] needs to come for and that's the real
[2:16:58] life that's going to come forth that
[2:17:00] life is the son of David and that's the
[2:17:02] life that your union with David
[2:17:06] brings when you anoint him King your
[2:17:09] life now all the trials and all the
[2:17:12] stuff that goes on because your life has
[2:17:14] anointed him King because you have had
[2:17:16] met the high priest that life now brings
[2:17:19] tribulation into your life like you
[2:17:21] wouldn't believe but you see you keep
[2:17:23] your eyes on Jesus you keep your eyes on
[2:17:26] him the whole time and no matter what
[2:17:28] happens you walk unconscious of of all
[2:17:30] the ridicule you walk unconscious of all
[2:17:33] those
[2:17:34] things
[2:17:36] so you under all those trials and all
[2:17:39] the maturity that raises up in you and
[2:17:41] all of those things so that you can come
[2:17:45] to your position because David rest
[2:17:48] assured when you anoint him
[2:17:52] King your Jerusalem is being
[2:17:55] rebuilt the Palaces are being rebuilt
[2:17:57] ready for you to come to your queenship
[2:18:00] ready for you to come to your position
[2:18:02] as
[2:18:04] Queen that's
[2:18:06] ruler that's why I tied in the talents
[2:18:09] and the gifts because if you can be
[2:18:11] faithful with the small things he says
[2:18:14] he that's faithful with the small things
[2:18:16] I will make him rulers of many cities
[2:18:21] and who there is great
[2:18:24] reward by you finding your talent and
[2:18:27] giving it to the Lord now God himself
[2:18:31] will operate that
[2:18:33] Talent when God operates that talent in
[2:18:37] your life when God operates it not you
[2:18:40] and it's very easy for you to operate
[2:18:41] your own gift but when God operates that
[2:18:44] gift he will operate it according to the
[2:18:46] very fulfillment of scripture yesen that
[2:18:50] gift will not take the people already
[2:18:52] into the Millennium it will not hold the
[2:18:55] people out in the wilderness that gift
[2:18:57] will be exactly the voice of the I am
[2:19:00] that is the everpresent Living God
[2:19:01] speaking to the people fighting the
[2:19:03] fight with David ready to take Jerusalem
[2:19:06] that's where we're at Saints if the
[2:19:08] musicians could
[2:19:12] come and just start playing number 48
[2:19:16] lest I forget Gethsemane

[2:20:13] Deliverance so that when people come
[2:20:15] into this church to be prayed for there
[2:20:18] will be just this little group maybe not
[2:20:20] over a hundred or two sitting here but
[2:20:24] they'll be completely in the hands of
[2:20:27] God do you follow me is this all tiing
[2:20:30] together praise the
[2:20:36] Lord and when we pray then God will hear
[2:20:39] from Heaven God wants somebody that he
[2:20:41] can hold in his hands somebody that he
[2:20:44] can say I got confidence in I can send
[2:20:48] this my sick servant to the brandom
[2:20:50] Tabernacle at Jeffersonville and that
[2:20:52] group of people are one Accord something
[2:20:55] will happen now I'm speaking to you as a
[2:20:57] as us as a group
[2:20:58] now can God have confidence to send
[2:21:02] someone to this
[2:21:03] group amen now it might sound like I'm
[2:21:06] I'm not angry or anything but I'm just
[2:21:08] saying I'm excited about it can God have
[2:21:11] confidence when someone comes here that
[2:21:14] they're at the they are coming to
[2:21:16] Father's House they're going to get that
[2:21:18] total Deliverance can happen Hallelujah
[2:21:20] their lives can change in a second
[2:21:23] because there's a people in one Accord

[2:21:28] there's are people whose talents are
[2:21:30] given to God Amen because there's a

[2:21:35] complex to heal every pain to heal every
[2:21:38] hurt to heal all the past right now
[2:21:41] right the second you can be healed and
[2:21:45] if you want to There's an opportunity
[2:21:46] for you to drive out the jebusite to
[2:21:50] drive out whatever inhabitant that would
[2:21:51] hold you back from your talent from your
[2:21:55] gift and your life being used by God

[2:22:02] condition that we're in what would he do
[2:22:04] if we were one heart and one Accord the

[2:22:09] hearts together with Brotherly Love obey
[2:22:12] the offices of the church and the pastor

[2:22:18] through the pastor through the board
[2:22:20] down into the church and all together
[2:22:22] are one unit to the kingdom of God then
[2:22:26] God will hear when we have UniFi a
[2:22:29] unified group let nothing bother you
[2:22:32] don't be dismayed at anything now that's
[2:22:34] the kind of a person that God ordained
[2:22:36] to take the land Moses was complete he
[2:22:40] was a man that wouldn't compromise if
[2:22:42] there were stews and fusses and so forth
[2:22:45] he wouldn't compromise that's what God
[2:22:47] wants us
[2:22:49] now pharaoh wanted to agree said Moses
[2:22:53] you all can go but leave your children
[2:22:55] behind or leave some of your cattle back
[2:22:58] here that's the way the devil wants a
[2:23:00] Christian to come it'll be all right for
[2:23:02] you to join the church but don't never
[2:23:04] give forgive Jones it'll be all right if

[2:23:10] you don't have to give up your smoking
[2:23:12] you're drinking you're lying you're
[2:23:13] stealing you're fault finding backbiting
[2:23:15] you don't have to give that up just join
[2:23:17] the church but Moses wasn't a
[2:23:19] compromiser
[2:23:21] he wasn't he he wanted complete
[2:23:23] deliverance he said we'll not leave one
[2:23:26] hoof behind we'll take everything that
[2:23:29] belongs to us when we go to Worship the
[2:23:33] Lord that's the way the church ought to
[2:23:35] be we'll take righteousness we'll take
[2:23:38] Holiness we'll take the Holy Spirit
[2:23:41] we'll take a unified group when we go to

[2:23:47] that desire who desires to be a real
[2:23:50] Church real Christians amen totally
[2:23:54] delivered forgetting the old
[2:23:56] Administration forgetting the way our
[2:23:58] parents bought us up doesn't matter you
[2:24:01] can be healed of those things forget
[2:24:04] that and walk into the vision where
[2:24:06] David King Jesus becomes king that
[2:24:10] headship that Administration is love
[2:24:12] pure
[2:24:14] love everything is done in love you see
[2:24:17] in the atmosphere of love someone that
[2:24:19] is not right become right amen and an
[2:24:22] atmosphere of legalism someone that's
[2:24:24] not right will leave or they will become
[2:24:27] legal but when there's love that person
[2:24:30] can grow into the person that God has
[2:24:32] made
[2:24:33] them with the law of
[2:24:39] Liberty Mo that's the way Moses and his
[2:24:41] group
[2:24:44] did they got over there and got under
[2:24:47] the blood you notice until they got
[2:24:49] under the blood there was no total
[2:24:51] Deliverance Moses himself he was unified
[2:24:53] with God but it wasn't but Israel wasn't
[2:24:57] there still was sin and they murmured
[2:24:59] against
[2:25:00] Moses and they said why why do you do
[2:25:04] this you bring more trouble upon us cuz
[2:25:06] Pharaoh just doubled their tally of
[2:25:08] bricks and so forth that was Moses he
[2:25:10] was completely in the hands of God
[2:25:13] totally delivered from sheep
[2:25:15] hurting to H God's she he was totally
[2:25:18] delivered himself but the people wasn't
[2:25:20] delivered because there was still
[2:25:22] murmuring among them one night when God
[2:25:25] ordained that a lamb should be killed
[2:25:27] type of Christ and the blood was dipped
[2:25:29] in hisop which just weeds common humble
[2:25:33] just put over the lentil of the door and
[2:25:34] on the post that's when Israel became
[2:25:37] completely delivered with not a hoof
[2:25:40] left behind all that belonged to them
[2:25:42] was delivered their families their loved
[2:25:43] ones and everything was delivered when
[2:25:45] they completely come under the blood
[2:25:48] that's when the church shall be
[2:25:50] completely delivered when everything
[2:25:52] comes under the blood when your sins
[2:25:54] come under the blood when you're smoking
[2:25:56] when you're gambling when you're
[2:25:57] cheating when you're stealing when
[2:25:59] you're lying when wrong somebody make it
[2:26:01] right you can't bring that under the
[2:26:03] blood it won't stay you can't bring it
[2:26:06] something won't let you do it when
