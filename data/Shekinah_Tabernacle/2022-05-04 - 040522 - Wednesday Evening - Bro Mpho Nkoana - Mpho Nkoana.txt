know for a believer for a christian i want to tell you this for a christian it's always nice doesn't matter what the devil does i want to inform you this evening in court they say i want to put it to you can i put it to you that in a christian's life in a believer's life doesn't matter the devil comes from the left or he comes from the right that is why paul said oh death where where where are you you dead where is your power for me to die to die is again to to live is christ so it doesn't matter what the devil does to you as a believer what what you know i i'll say much when we sit down let's read the scripture genesis chapter 22 how many are happy to be in the presence of the lord tonight let's read genesis chapter 22. i've got a gadget tonight brother ed is this one on yeah i put it i think it's green there it's not yet i'll press it like this or like this oh yeah huh oh yeah thank you thank you sir it looks like it's working huh let's go into the music now i didn't put that one oh yeah thank you so much i was looking at a paragraph of a song let's read the word of god let's just take our hearts and be reverent before god you know when moses came to the mountain god himself told you moses take off your shoes for the place where you are is holy so this evening you you didn't come here to hear braden paul i'm i mean entity but jesus christ is somebody that's who we are here to hear tonight including me so let's be reverent let's focus on the lord let's let's have fellowship with him as the songs were saying and i welcome each one of you so nice to see your faces genesis 22 and we'll read from verse 15 to 17. amen the bible says from verse 15 and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven and the second time and said by myself have i sworn said the lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son then only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies heavenly father please lord bless your weight you promised it father that where two or three are gathered in my name you shall be there lord is not only two here tonight lord and we ask for your favor we ask for your unmerited grace lord we ask father god for your inspiration we ask that you be the speaker here tonight bless your weight father to the hearts of your children in the name of our lord jesus christ we ask thanksgiving amen please enjoy the comfort and i would like us to speak tonight about a thought uh i'll read this one but i would like us to talk about that that title or that topic which is position then possession uh we all understand those ways brothers and sisters are we together do we all understand those three ways there position then possession let's read john when jesus therefore had received the vinegar this is what the pastor read recently am i right hey brother ben when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished the reason i underlined that that a way well it's underlined in the bible is is also read but i would have also bolded it is because the lord himself said uh we are we are at the end now is done everything is completed you'll see why i'm saying that as we go along and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost because it was finished right so it sounds like what the lord is saying there that the job is done i always give an example about me and mario sorry brother marion you happen to work with me brother i'm so sorry when we are done you if you hear marion saying brother paul that's us you know that is finished we are going home which means the job for the day is done right so is it finished it is finished meaning it means so much it's done that's what the pastor said now that topic i i want you to think about two ways mainly position and possession possession is when you own something when you take something to be yours right when you take ownership of something when you go and take something and now is at your disposal right you are now possessing it right whether it was yours before whether you fought with somebody and you won that thing whether you you whatever you did but as long as now you you you are in possession that is your position but we find out that and the position is very critical towards you getting your possession and that's what we want to look at tonight can i take off my jacket is it okay so we we need to look at that aspect of your position in relation to your position why is it so important to first be in position why is it so important it sounds like your position determines your possession ah okay let's look at this how many how many knows who what what what what is this picture here huh you see if you look at that pitch that is a football ground it's a soccer or soccer or football ground and you see that those people they they if you don't know you'll say oh oh they made a nice little pattern yeah but in actual fact those people are standing in positions those who know football i didn't have a better example i i don't know much cricket or rugby or even baseball what did they call it basketball i know this one this one i know it so you see these people here you it's what you call okay firstly before we move on who can tell me what is missing in these positions there's something important that is missing in these positions so i'm not it's not a soccer test quiz i just want to to show you the importance of position ah i want to ask girls because i know boys will know sister rebecca i like i like your i like your you know your determination what is missing you see there's something that is missing here now this these guys are supposed to be 11 but there are only 10 you see so something is already not in position in that picture that we are seeing are we together but the people are well organized this is the back line you know this is the back line the super is there this is the central midfield these are all uh our uh uh we call them what do you call them jasmine the winners or the wingers is the difference then these are the strikers the front line so these guys are the engine of the game these guys are the goal scorers usually we need somebody who can run who cannot and some of these guys are meet attackers you know so these are the guys who defend our goals so each and everyone be in position but there's no goalkeeper so how can we win that match but they are organized they are put in their position let's look at that one what do you think of this one you see that i don't know if these guys are organized i don't know if these guys are in position or each and everyone is on their but i see everyone with their ball with a ball everyone wants to score in this picture here do you think this pattern will work this one maybe but do you think this one will work everyone wants to score everyone wants to get credit everyone wants to take position everyone wants to to win the best man of the match can you see in that picture so it won't work there's not even an organization there but let's look at this one this is the last picture but i just want to show you to demonstrate or illustrate the importance of being in position look at that similar to the one to the first one but the what's the difference there sister lilia what's the difference there's a goalie there's a goalie you get 95 percent they say goalie oh you i give you a hundred there is a goalie there i'm sorry there's a goalie here now this formation looks normal right it looks normal everyone is in their position but it's still not the end of the game yet the game is only beginning the the ultimate purpose of this arrangement where everybody must be in a in a position is that we must get a possession yeah the people even in football even rugby every other game you'll hear another analyst saying and oh but those guys had a possession man they had 80 possession of the ball throughout the game meaning they were in control likely those guys have won the game in most cases it's very very unusual that we dominate and we are in possession of the ball and everything and then we lose it happens it happens in the wealthy patterns but the message is you'll get your position and your possession you win the game brother so now the introduction that i wanted is that what what what is the position we if the position you know at work you know in different positions people have got positions a position is a it's a is the allocation of your your responsibility the allocation of your duty that you you you are sitting your position describes you yeah your position describes that uh you are a cleaner or you are a ceo your position explains you that you are a mother or you are a child that's your position so we don't want to be out of position we don't want to be those people remember remember the rule here is there's not there's no rule that says this man here cannot score a goal but he's at the back line but there's no rule that says he cannot score a goal but he needs to maintain his position in order i forgot to put my voice tonight you don't mind about time uh uh uh i must i must have spent how many brothers maybe five minutes i must give it give it three hey let's give it three so we'll start with three and minus three at the end god bless you all right now what i'm saying is that uh we we may be all in our positions but remember each and everyone will get a position you've got the possessions allocated to you based on how you're utilizing your position you cannot get a possession when you are out of position are we together now a position is something that is described so many things in it and it ultimately helps you to exercise and to get your possession right that is why you need to have a position that is why you need to be in position now there is the physical side and there's the spiritual side we'll talk a little bit about the physical side just to demonstrate how to apply it on the spiritual side on the physical side you'll find that and if a a a manager a manager can be out of his position the firm runs amok the fam loses the profit because the man is out of position he's supposed to be giving us the strategy business strategy he's supposed to be giving us the direction where are we going leading us um and or if you find that our cleaner she's busy trying to do it where do you think we will be each one must be within their positions but remember the ultimate goal is that the firm must make profit the ultimate goal is that the team must win and have possession of the game and get a cup or an award right that's the ultimate goal but wha wha what is therefore a possession is something that you you get something that you take something that you you win something that you are given right after you have get you have used your position the prophet says them now that's who now that's who his address it to in jesus the believer's position is in christ and christ will only meet the believer the believer can only worship christ as he is positionally placed in christ you see so we need to be positional let's quickly switch to the spiritual right now we need to be spiritually placed in the world that is our purpose each and everyone while we want to be positionally placed in a church while we want to be positionally placed in your home while we want to be positionally placed at our work while we want to be positionally placed in the music each and every one of his orchestra is in a position while we want to be in that way but we also wants to be positionally placed in the weight and that's the main important one and that's what i want to drive your thoughts or your hearts towards this evening apply the spiritual life apply the physical life and then we'll be able to see it better are we together now he says here the prophet in that spoken word god's provided we we cannot have a healing service here until people get in the spirit of the healing service how can you get into the spirit of rugby but you are playing soccer are we together you you you you need ev that is what places you in position a position is not just one thing that we say ah no no no no you need to have a bigger higher brother nd high level overview what do you call it a bigger picture you need to understand the bigger picture you need to understand your own position and have a picture of your position and your position how it relates with other positions are we together brothers and sisters i mustn't lose you here your position in relation to other positions right the word of god is where me and you are placed positionally right and if you we miss it that's why the prophet says we cannot have a healing service here until people get in the spirit of the healing service we cannot have have a volume of the holy ghost until people get in that kind of atmosphere his position atmosphere ah and the people once and the people was in the atmosphere in that day to bring judgment upon the earth you see so that is in that spoken word god provided way of worship there is a way in which god have set up a team called the end time bride in the end of the ages in the seven church ages and god has said okay seven churches first age second a state fought fifth six seven and a god in that age he also set up an arrangement and in the seven church age there are those that are going to be at the end of the line so each and everyone is positionally placed so we need to have that i that that mindset of understanding the body and your position within the body are we together that is why when we eat communion huh that is why when we eat communion system we say that um we we we we we prepare ourselves we get ready to eat communion we understand the solemnity the importance and the and that this is insanity the importance and the holiness of communion as an ordinance that the lord has given and we come with all sincerity how can i come with all sincerity when i'm angry with brother ben how can i how can i come with sincerity when certain things there's still some blockages no no everything must be flushed and ready to stand here because why i understand the body i understand the meaning of my position are we together so so so paul says in there what does the scripture say he says we we sleep because we don't descend the body we i believe that he also mean it spiritually we slumber because we don't want to recognize the body if we can't recognize the body can you recognize our position in the body your influence in the body are we together i want to go slow tonight brother isaac so um let's read the next one there and i don't believe you you get it that's not me that's the prophet i don't believe you get it let me go another route look look a believer cannot worship and hate has no right to worship a believer cannot worship and has no right to worship no man has the right to worship the lord outside of being in the body of the lord jesus christ did you know that he's asking it's so important to be in line to be in position because that's what that's what helps you to achieve your ultimate possession otherwise you're gonna take sister mike's position thinking that it's yours otherwise we're gonna grapple and fight for possessions we find that no no we're all speaking in tongues i'm not saying we can't but each one every one of us has been given possessions but we need to be in our position in order to get our positions that's the thought tonight and uh the prophet there is a very powerful statement and sorry i didn't quote there but that comes from this spoken word what i was reading for you know it comes from believers position in christ if you see any other quote from now on that is not it's got no reference it comes from this spoken word i'm just putting in the stream others like this will will say god's provided way amen now he says here the man of god look in the old testament back there back there when the believer they had a tabernacle and in the tabernacle no man had the right to do worship unless he come to the tabernacle who is the tabernacle in this case the lord is our ark the lord is the tabernacle the word the lord is the word the lord is the place of worship we come together to meet in this body which is the head the head is the lord jesus christ we are the body and we come in that body are we together in that there's a mystical body but there's a bigger body ah that bigger body is headed by the lord jesus christ and we come in there and in the old testament the believers did not could not go and worship him anyway you had to come to the tabernacle and when you come to the tabernacle you must be in the right attire you must be in with the right animal you must come with the right arrangement to be within your position otherwise they present you back that's me and you brothers and sisters we come with all our hearts we come with all our dedication with all our lives by the way we still fail and that's why we come for him to help us as we die daily he help us he go every step of the way with us but we must come the right way within our positions are we together i want to read the next one the next one says spending time within that atmosphere this atmosphere start with me brother ben the day that you mentioned that atmosphere is everything how many can remember this atmosphere is everything you need to be in that atmosphere to maintain your position or you must be in your position to maintain your atmosphere whichever way that you like to put it all of the above but it was enoch who claimed that he worked with god for 500 years and had a testimony he pleased god in other words enoch maintained his position to walk within the word of god are we together he had faith that he wouldn't see death can i do that you can me and you can be so positionally placed until we believe that we are not going to see death and we believe it and we will sit in that position until you please god so much that he takes you and then you are found to be no more on this earth why just simply because of maintaining your position there wasn't even a jet plane in those days to get him off his feet but god provided a way a translation that took enoch from earth to glory without receiving death that's what me that's that's what is within reach today i'm not telling you tales brothers and sisters that is what is within reach to me and to you today is within reach in what sense because look look at it this way uh we always say the devil is quite experienced you know what sometimes i get a bit annoyed that we are praising him so we are giving him too much credit well it's true he had fought the battles even though he never won he has fought them we say he's got six thousand years of experience but the occupant we say so and we say you know and it's true but we are only saying that to try to show you that this enemy when you come to him you only bring jesus you must only bring the weight because but but you see it sounds like he's so powerful huh but if he is so powerful he is god the arc enemy who is quite trillion powerful than him quite really on i don't have the higher number this is the person maybe you can tell me what is the highest number zillion yeah what is that one number his enemies more he created him right that is on the side where the devil thinks he is powerful ah and if he thinks that we believe that he's so weak he's so weak before the lord he's so weak because inside even us he's below us as who were born in sin god has put the capability inside you that the devil can be down there that powerful guy who's called six thousand years of battle huh so he doesn't win it whether he feels his powerful we've got jesus if he's small he we are above him are we together do you get the analogy for the idol you get it there i i don't want the boys to sleep sorry mo are you awake there's the pastor when you when you sleep he says wait i'm not going to waste my same one you can sleep at school wake up my boy he does that so i i don't know if i'll be within my eyes too to introduce that and say okay let's just pause a bit and then go and wake up every day and say no no my boy you'll sleep in school then not in here to really make a point to the devil you don't sleep in here hallelujah can we say amen to that now let's move to the next slide now god now god said then abraham in order to work with me you've got to separate yourself from the rest of them we saw a picture at the beginning of people that were like separated why because each and everyone must be in their position to get their possession you cannot just we just play we just stand in a group in a football match we are just in a group and we are saying we are going to win a match the other guys that opponent have taken their position they are spreading they are opening edges they are opening spaces you know the language they they're opening spaces to win this game to for passes to come we are standing in a group we say we want to win this game in a group like this right right in a soccer match you lost we must take posie you we must not separated in the sense of not working together but spread to be able to attack so abraham had to be separated from his people he had to be separated god demands a total separation but you want to bring a lot of the world along with you why even our father did it our father abraham even him he did it he allowed lord to come with him and lord came with him in his position how will he get this position if he's dragging others we can't drag people into heaven i take my position you take yours you know my wife was telling me because the brother was preaching about and it was at a couple's meeting and then he was preaching and said you find the brothers telling the sisters that yo listen the word of god says you must obey her your husband the brothers will sit on that point they will sit on it disney brother will sit on it but you see that the point is this that scripture is meant to the system to confess it to exercise it it's not for me to to tell no no it's for her to take it and use it my scripture is to say husband do what that's for mine not for her to be saying hey remember each one must be in their position as long as each one can be in their positions nothing will go out of cata but we find that we say no hey listen the bible says you must respect me no no me i'm a sister i listen to the bible i eat the word of god i exercise it that's my part you do yours i do yours we are in our position we win the game isn't it i i'm not saying we can't correct one another but all i'm saying is that we shouldn't be say no no each one takes their part number backline goalkeeper whoever we play the game we pass the ball to one another we win we get our possession that's the whole idea right i didn't hear much amen from brothers then by this uh then by his holy spirit seeing that the mother was to be part of the sun also because they are part of the flesh then the holy spirit were working through those these people and said he let your seed possess the gate of the enemy then god answering he would possess the gate of the enemy right now now it was god telling abraham about what is going to happen to his seat we are taking our possession today because abraham took his position that is why we are we are doing what our father did like father like then god answered swearing he would possess the gate of the enemy then what position does that put the church of the living god where does that put us we are the seat of abraham amen and we are possessing the gates of our enemy today we are possessing them because we are by by virtue of us being abraham's sons and daughters we are taking we have to you know there's no way whether you like it or not you are god's seed and that will happen have you ever seen an orange saying no no me i'll be a banana i'll be a banana no no no coming out wanting to be a banana it is unarranged by by by by creation so you can't deny yourself you you so this is to remind you that hey as you grow make sure that you become a fresh banana or a fresh orange make sure that in in your you do it so well within your position that's the thinking are we together we are abraham seed for we being dead in christ we are take on abraham's seed and our air with him under the same sun promise that that goes there it is under the same promise when he said your seed will possess the gate of the enemy that's us are we together are we aiming in that one then take through the um then taken through the blood till the blood cell we come through the spray of blood then by the holy spirit are baptized into the this blood cell and we have fellowship one with another while the blood of jesus christ son of god cleanses from all unrighteousness oh my there you are that's what we need positionally confessed to christ through the blood the shed blood then positionally we are seated we have already passed we are watched by the blood but all we need to do now right we are now with cross jordan we are now entering joshua is leading and caleb we are now in all what we need to do to take jericho is to be positionally pleased the moment we go around jericho two times yet because you're not full there must be a position and arrangement that god has said we have already we are in you are in brothers and sisters there's nothing that the enemy is going to do nothing and i promise you there's nothing all what he's doing we just have to remind him that listen doesn't matter whether you for six thousand years we are in he's inside me and i'm inside him now you are there for zero right you are below me you devil so all i need to do he just want to disturb you to disturb you not to be positionally pleased if you find that that the other team has scored 10 goals 10 goals they know they have won 10 minutes is left they have called 10 goals do you think there's a chance for the other team huh do you think there's a chance for the other team so the issue is that the other team can just frustrate them they can just play the ball around and just pass the ball to one another that's what the devil wants to do the devil think that he can frustrate us but we actually are the ones to frustrate the devil we must become the devil's devil because we know that we are already 10 not that's our score 10 note so all we need to do we just keep our positions intact pass the ball to one another open up the spaces for another the devil he cannot he he all he can just blow up he can just best there's nothing he can do that's to be our approach to the devil he shouldn't be scaring us as if we are not leading goal scorers in this game we are leading and the time is five minutes left how can he win and he already got the red card at the cross some of his players are out so you play the game like the person who has already won the game is not over yet but you won you are living you've got 10 full players and you're going to keep up the devil has got no keep ideas he has been red carted and some of his players are injured how can he win with us leading 10 goals sorry i'm not preaching i'm trying to demonstrate a point right now the blood of the lord jesus has already done the job we have accepted we have been baptized we have been washed we are clean we are now just doing what you call the finishing touches so let's do it well by being within our positions hallelujah let's read more sorry tonight i'm just gonna preach by means of reading because i realize that if i just go on and others lose me so i want you to follow me but jesus knew that he was there and he knew he was in that condition when he was questioned he said verily i say unto you that son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that they'll do with the son likewise you see that is that his same position today what is this thing that when when you see the father you only act when you see the father all our play in this game is all what the coach is telling us is there's a captain in this game and that captain he's got a band he's got a captain bent with the blood that that came from calvary that captain is the one that coordinates this game he's the because he he's the strategist in this game he's the ceo of this company so we are not afraid we are not going to make a loss we know we already have a profit brother andy we have a profit already and there's already a deposit an ernest deposit has already been put for us so he says it that's his same position no prophet no one has ever been able to do anything outside the sovereignty of god god's will that's right what god will so the point i wanted to bring here is that uh with all what we do in everything that we do we was always here the still small voice of our of our lord of our captain in this game because even the lord jesus took that possession position very clearly that is why he won he said the son will never do anything until the father say something until it is the will of the father are we following let's just remember one thing brothers and sisters let's just remember another person right away here or a group of people that's israel when israel had to put their place themselves in position to take the stand for god you remember that israel will never even be blessed as long as they were out of their position as long as they were out of the promised land god wouldn't bless them yes they could think that they are prospering they are working hard they are doing this when they were in goshen when they were in babylon when they were well now those god god god is the loving god but the real blessing that positionally places israel was when they were in the promised land because they were positionally placed that's where god is fulfilling his word for them that's why he wanted them to go there that is why abraham took his wife and buried her at macapela what do you call the place mark pela because abraham understood the position of being in the promised land he understood it very well and that's why me and you today must be be buried at macapel that's not the same one that's another samurai and there was coming a dead angel one night that was going to take the first born every in every house he was going to kill the children of israel even them if they did not positionally arrange themselves if there was no blood if there was no everything that the lord wanted had to be done otherwise all the first bones were going to die first bones of cats first bones of dogs first bones of humans first bones of all the cockroaches you have at home everything first born was going to die so they had to come in position the children of israel mama sheila isn't it they had to come in position otherwise there was going to be a problem but jesus knew paragraph was 2 16 but jesus knew from the same spoken word oh sorry this one is from remembering the lord but jesus knew that um i think i've read this one right let me move to the next one speaking things into existence when you are in position that remember earlier and i said to you it will come to pass that you will speak things into existence that you will say things in your life and they will happen simply because you took your position let's listen to the men of god in the spoken word investment he says and we have the opportunity we are invited to receive this christ that that god could take you and position you in his way in such a place till when you speak the things that the things that that's foresaw and foretold and so forth could work right through you every time exactly right never fails cannot fail simply because you took your position simply because you are placed positionally you will see things that are still coming you'll see things that you you'll foresee things and speak your things into existence it's all about the position that we need to to have and maintain it on a daily basis are we together i'm almost finishing today i won't take long and we have the opportunity so that's our opportunity tonight now let's let's let's let's look at that i want us to talk about to read the scripture john 20 verse 19. let's read john 20 verse 19 i think with the the brothers just leave the screen there to allow everyone to open their bible to give each one an opportunity to read the bible john 20 verse 19. and then from this i mean john 20 verse 19 to 23 right he says here are we are we there then the same the same day at evening being this is now after the resurrection he rose up then he then the same day remember he said it is finished at the beginning remember jesus took his position at the cross that is why he you could have you could say the words it is finished now listen to it is finished now this is what is finished he says now he's appearing to them now then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of jews came jesus and stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you that's the man who says it is finished as if they they hate me they also write that peace be unto you in red you know they understand my language of wanting to build something that's what the lord said peace be unto you and when he had said so he showed unto them his hands and his side then where the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me my part is finished now as my father sent me even so send i you he's pleasing them are you hearing he's positionally setting them up verse 22 and he had he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghost and he said in verse 23 whosoever seen he remit they are remitted unto them and so ever since he returned they are retained what a power what the position he was telling them this is your from now on i'm done i'm done my part but i'm gonna be with you but i'm giving you this authority because position is authority will come to realize that positions determines your authority let's look at that let's look at just the first one position for possession let's think of the children of israel when they were in the promised land if they missed their position the other group that went with joshua and caleb they missed it that is why they could not gain their possession had it not been by the grace of god had it not been for joshua and caleb they were going to miss the promised land as long as israel was out of position they wouldn't get their position king david killing goliath or joshua and caleb position his victory position gives you your victory you get your position you get your victory you lose your position you lose your victory you lose it i don't know about somebody who loses his position he's not in his position but he's still victorious i'm yet to see that kind of a person and the position brings your healing remember he said when you are in position anything you can see anything even the things that are not of present you can tell us that tomorrow nine o'clock you'll someone will call you for a job interview and you are going to get that job because you are in position you you you are past the level you can see what is going to happen you are in position god is using you for your position and i must not want to be like you no no i must be in my position isn't it okay that's how what i must be is that so so and we see there that position for deliverance basically the list goes on and on and on and on i cannot exhaust the list for how important my position in the body my position in the family my position at work my position anywhere even when i walk on the road i must be in my position to understand that the position is not just a title to be in position no no no no there's so much built in the position just like there's so much built in the position of this body of the lord jesus christ there is so much build in them are we together position for peace israel have made of many years of peace yet they were led by a man of war called gideon the bible did they say for for more than 40 years if i'm not mistaken there was peace in the land because they were in position they were positionally placed and there was peace and not only gideon but many other kings right and position for power over satan i like that one that that is that is you get your power when you are within your position to overcome your enemy to tell to put your enemy in his position your position will enable you to place your enemy in his position right and intel give you your possession that's what this position is all about the apostle paul brother branham you must look at his life there were times when he he certain things yesterday as a human being he also made mistakes and the angel of the lord disappeared from him huh the angel of the lord was not there and he had to come back to his position in his heart in his life everything and then the angel of the lord appears again so the same thing must happen to me and you brothers and sisters if we we miss as we walk along the line we have to go back and see god to be brought back to the position of his weight so that the angel the sensitivity of the spirit he says the prophet in one spoken word if you offend the holy spirit he's so sensitive and he he just flies and stan stand there by the pool and then you are wondering why things happen and then you come to your senses by the grace of god and you see god you see god and he flies comes back to take his position in you in me that's what that's how sensitive he is so sensitive that a little child can run here and disturb the presence of the holy spirit i'm not saying we mustn't run i'm just trying to show you that the one that we save we need to understand his presence to be sensitive to his presence to know how he operates to dance in the spirit but in position are we together position for for authority i even ran out of examples there's so much about your position all these people that you see on earth doing all different things they lost their position they lost it that is why i i try to speak at least to someone once a day this one person just about something to do with god and i've come to know to realize that ah people have lost their position people don't know who they are anymore i said to this lady today i say my my friend um i have to go now the train is leaving me because i'm ministering tonight i'm preaching he said oh i said do you go to church he said no and you know what from that point he was not interested i thought i'll get to a point where i'll say can i give you the link no i didn't get that chance because people have lost their position it's our duty to to bring the appetite back it is our job the song that brother isaac wrote about harvesting the harvesters are few now we need to help to bring this dying world and give them an opportunity about what they have lost many of them are our brothers and sisters are we together many of them but they don't know yet and even us we don't know but how will we know if we don't tell them how will we know if we don't just cut it man just say it hey we are going to church tonight can you come with have you have you have you made your life right with the lord are you ready to meet god just questions like that are you just out of the blue then until someone just what's that what did you say no i was just asking you are you ready to meet the lord he says no i don't i don't know about that what is that is it a church thing say no no it's not a church that's how they ask people have lost so it is we let's not waste the pearls that the lord left with us let's invest them in people's life just to tell someone ah even if they start labeling you they still start labeling you that hey that's a fanatic but we must come to that point but out of those that are labeling you there are those that are going to come because you have given them you have afforded them an opportunity you have spoken life in their lives you have given it to them just one person a day that you have never spoken or you have never met hello god bless you huh do you know what that means in in the former get pushed in the trolley she bums you somebody bump you or you bump somebody i don't mean bump people on papers just to say god bless you you bum somebody say oh so i'm so sorry i'm sorry my brother god bless you you know that person can say what does that mean that can be a lifeline for someone to say see you there and the lord can just put happen to put your cars together at the parking so that when you come out you say sorry man you bumped me but you said something very strange that can be the door for that man and that woman to get eternal life to get eternal life my brother my sister not to go to hell that can be the opportunity that can be the chance so let's not waste those kind of opportunities let's be in our position let's be always in season and out of season simple things i like to verbalize things i'll that's how i'm made i like to verbalize things until yesterday i told that guy remember i gave you a testimony of the guy who fell at my work and he was having a demon disturbing him and wanting to kill him and i saw a demon there and when everybody was running to get a pillow to help him to do this i said lord what can i do something said pray i just pray loud [Laughter] my boss came to me and said hey thanks for that i said oh pl pleasure pleasure pleasure i said i thought i thought nobody helped me but i was praying loudly trying to cast this demon because i saw that he wants to kill this man before he can receive christ so that was then yesterday the lord made an opportunity because i went to the office i went out for tea late afternoon tea i'm finished now i'm just giving this little testimony then we are done then then i see i can't say his name i see him passing and then it i just happened to be alone on the couches and he was just grabbing his jacket on the hangers i said hey mate how are you hey man you know that day when you had that thing of it he said oh the seizure i said yes you know it stuck with me man he said oh i said yeah and you know i prayed for you hey and i saw you i sustaining red i said yeah you know i prayed for you that day and you know what i believe that god can remove that thing from you any me and sorry me and you can believe we can believe and that thing can go away he was like he said all he could say was that thank you so much mate thank you because i i something spoke to me that that person i must pray for him and i must tell him about jesus that this thing is not his that the demon of seizure can go away i said to him if you believe god can remove it you can help me you can help me i said to him you can help me to believe together that that thing go away god can remove it so i just left it with you because he we you know god he's the high priest of our confession and he is touched by the feeling of our infirmities you know the pains that people feel that they go through we must not be insensitive people are going through pain and we must feel it the lord brings them to us for a purpose can i just show you one more time there are some people that you are meeting them for the first time as you walk into town or anywhere you are meeting them in town as you walk past you will never meet them again in their life in this life and you have seen them that's it you only have two seconds to meet a person in life that's it there'll come a point where they think that we are mad we just stand in the middle of upper heart and say brothers and sisters i greet you all in the name of our lord then the police just come and chat me away and i say god bless you that's what i wanted to tell you there will come a time like that it must come so that we can bring opportunity of eternal life to people and bring our rapture closer to go home the more we are comfortable the more we are fussy the more we are easy the more we delay our goal the more we give the enemy a position sorry brothers and sisters i just mean to encourage you that let's break the spirit let's break this national spirit this wealthy spirit that uh you cannot talk at work about god what is that what is that when we are told that ah let's put a process in the system to talk about the rainbow people huh but i can't tell someone about god at work no i can't accept that fire me then fire me i'm already fired up so fire me let me tell somebody about god while he or she is telling me about the rainbow then we exchange well i will tell that person about the true sir that's rainbow may god help us must not be ashamed mustn't be ashamed there'll come a time when we will tell people blatantly no no god has sent a prophet i don't like just come one side and then well we are given different gifts we are given different approaches and different things as the lord leads you just maintain your position you will see him leading you and guiding you we must tell them if we can tell jesus about them surely the lord can tell us to go and tell them life i want to ask the the treasurer that the trustees i want my car at the back to be painted in the days of the voice of the seven angel revelation 10 verse 7 to be plucked on the windscreen so that when i walk here people can read gone are the days where we just read on our will screen matthew 17 vested why why are those days gone it used to happen in my day when i was a little boy where did you find the brother and his car at the back of the wheel screen it's just written there maliki four male like five four verse five and six and people start to ask themselves you are spreading the gospel you are making people to be inquisitive but no no not on my car today not on my car the insurance won't allow sorry brother ben but we can put bailey builders i'm sorry you're my friend why brother ben put bailey builders for his work i must put there revelation 10 verse 7 or i just say in the days of the voice then they can come and ask me what is that what what is that on your car say come to my house come here i've got come and see yes come and see that's the title of our next sermon come and see let's stand on our feet i'm so proud of myself tonight that i've taken less than an hour may god bless you [Applause] god bless you and let's maintain our positions on a serious note brothers and sisters i might not have presented it properly but the point that i'm trying to bring is maintain your position in the weight maintain your position in your mind in your heart maintain it don't allow the enemy to take you out of position because it is in that position when you get your possession all the time it is in that position when you knock the devil at it we say in africans it means always altered bro mario held it now there is a song that i would like us to see if musicians can come i'm a good boy today and there's a song that i would like us to sing sister tiana and let's just be reverend before the lord as we sing that song is it you what do you call it brother ed you call it a medley it's two songs says he wasn't looking at me he wasn't looking at me when he took me in that's what the song says

lord jesus you you are not blind father and you are not deaf you can hear and you can answer in the name of our lord jesus christ but the god the devil who easily follows us tonight we rebuke him in

churches we pray for them because we know it is them that the enemy targets it is them that resembles our age when we shall be in heaven it is them that are at the prime of the age at the prime of their lives and not they are at the time when they are making decisions about life that is why the enemies so jealousy about them we come truthfully my father burying them realizing the kind of challenges that they go through realizing the situations that they go through sometimes in experience about those situations my father my god you are the one who is more experienced apply it unto them
