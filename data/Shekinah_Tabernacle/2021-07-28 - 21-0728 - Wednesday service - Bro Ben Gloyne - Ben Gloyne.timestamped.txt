[28:48] amen amen so let's turn to the book of
[28:51] judges
[28:51] uh we're going to read from judges
[28:55] chapter 6 and then we're going to go to
[28:56] jeremiah 1.
[28:59] amen everyone happy to be in the house
[29:01] of the lord tonight
[29:03] amen so we're in judges chapter 6 and
[29:06] we're going to read from verse
[29:07] 11.
[29:11] we're going to read verses one and two
[29:12] first actually we'll drop down to verse
[29:14] 11.
[29:14] uh sorry so verse one thank you and the
[29:18] children of israel
[29:19] did evil in the sight of the lord and
[29:21] the lord delivered them into the hand of
[29:23] midian seven years
[29:25] and the hand of midian prevailed against
[29:27] israel and because of the midianites the
[29:29] children of israel made them dens
[29:31] which were in the mountains and caves
[29:33] and strongholds
[29:35] so they just tried to hide away from the
[29:36] problem and we go down to verse 11
[29:39] and there came an angel of the lord and
[29:41] sat under an oak which
[29:42] was an offer that pertained unto
[29:45] joash the abazarite and his son gideon
[29:50] thresh wheat by the wine priest to hide
[29:52] it from the midianites
[29:53] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[29:55] him and said unto him the lord is with
[29:56] thee thou mighty man of hell
[29:58] and gideon said unto him o my lord if
[30:01] the lord be with us
[30:03] why then does all this befall in us and
[30:05] where be all his miracles which our
[30:07] fathers told
[30:08] us of saying did not the lord bring us
[30:10] up from egypt
[30:12] but now the lord hath forsaken us and
[30:14] delivered us into the hand of the
[30:15] midianites
[30:17] and the lord looked upon him and said go
[30:19] in this thy might
[30:21] and that and thou shalt save israel from
[30:24] the hand of the midianites
[30:26] have not i sent thee and he said unto
[30:29] him o my lord wherewith shall i save
[30:32] israel behold
[30:33] my family is poor in manasseh and i am
[30:36] the least in my father's
[30:38] house amen and let's go to jeremiah 1
[30:44] um i was going to read jeremiah 1 verses
[30:47] 4 down to 9.
[30:55] read this here jeremiah one and four it
[30:57] says this
[30:59] amen if you're there say amen
[31:03] if you're on your way you're on your way
[31:08] jeremiah 1 4
[31:11] then the word of the lord came unto me
[31:13] saying before i
[31:15] formed thee in the belly i knew thee and
[31:17] before thou camest forth out of the womb
[31:19] i sanctified thee
[31:21] and i ordained thee a prophet unto the
[31:23] nations
[31:25] then said i ah lord god behold i cannot
[31:28] speak for i am a child
[31:29] but the lord said unto me say not i'm a
[31:32] child
[31:32] for thou shalt go to all that i shall
[31:35] send thee
[31:36] and whatsoever i command thee thou shall
[31:38] speak be not afraid of their faces for i
[31:41] am worthy to to deliver thee
[31:43] uh saith the lord and then the lord put
[31:46] forth his hand and touched my mouth and
[31:48] the lord said unto me behold i have put
[31:50] my words
[31:51] in thy mouth amen may the lord bless the
[31:55] reading of his word you may have the
[31:56] comfort of your seats tonight
[31:58] and i want to speak if i can approach a
[32:00] subject about when god and man meets
[32:02] together
[32:03] now it's very to me it's very incredible
[32:06] how we would read here in
[32:08] in the book of judges where where gideon
[32:11] you know gideon was threshing wheat and
[32:14] secret hiding it from the midianites we
[32:16] read there that they
[32:17] because the israel did evil in the side
[32:18] of the lord the midianites came in and
[32:20] they
[32:20] took over basically and and israel's
[32:23] answer was instead of repenting and
[32:24] seeking god they just built caves and
[32:26] dens and they just tried to hide away
[32:28] from the problem
[32:29] instead of facing the problem hit on and
[32:31] uh but we see here that that
[32:33] that gideon you know it's amazing the
[32:36] difference between what
[32:38] we say about ourselves and what god says
[32:40] about us they can be two polar opposite
[32:42] things
[32:43] very very very polarly opposite so
[32:46] here is gideon the angel of the lord
[32:48] says that he's a mighty man of valor
[32:51] and he's gonna deliver uh you know and
[32:54] and and this angel's going to tell him
[32:56] go in this thy might and he's threshing
[32:59] wheat in secret
[33:00] and his response uh to the lord is
[33:03] i am you know i'm the least of my
[33:06] brethren and my family
[33:07] is poor uh i'm the least of my father's
[33:11] house and my family is poor in manasseh
[33:13] this was
[33:13] this was what he thought about himself
[33:15] but what god said about him was very
[33:17] different
[33:18] and we really need to look at ourselves
[33:20] the way god
[33:21] looks at us amen because we've got to
[33:24] understand that the way god sees us is
[33:25] how the lord said to get in
[33:27] the mighty man of allah he was threshing
[33:30] wheat
[33:30] by you know in secret there but in him
[33:33] was this mighty man of valor and this is
[33:35] how god saw him and so
[33:37] so gideon had to get a revelation i am a
[33:40] mighty man of valor
[33:41] i am here to actually deliver i'm here
[33:43] for a job and that job is not to thresh
[33:45] wheat in secret
[33:46] hiding from my enemy hoping that
[33:47] something will will cause them to go
[33:49] away but
[33:50] actually god's gonna make me step on the
[33:52] battlefield and i'm the one who's gonna
[33:54] drive them out
[33:55] you know brother brown would say in the
[33:56] deity of jesus christ he said
[33:59] he said and that same power that same
[34:01] christ hallelujah
[34:02] he says let the fundamentalists let them
[34:05] people who deny the power of god say
[34:07] it's wrong
[34:08] but that same power that spoke the world
[34:10] into existence is in those people
[34:12] that's got the holy ghost that's right
[34:15] men and women it's time that we found
[34:17] out who you are
[34:18] the devil's tried to hide you back tell
[34:21] you you're
[34:22] some little count down something you're
[34:24] not you're sons and daughters of god
[34:26] the deity is not in heaven it's in you
[34:29] hallelujah
[34:30] i know you think i'm crazy but let me
[34:31] tell you something brother
[34:33] i mean when you realize that almighty
[34:35] god lives in you immortal life
[34:37] my life i give zoe the life of god is in
[34:40] the human being he can stand back there
[34:43] he's the creator of all things he made
[34:45] life frogs obese ducks chickens animals
[34:48] created everything and nothing was made
[34:51] but what was made by him who christ the
[34:54] deity
[34:55] he brought down plagues everything in
[34:56] the days of egypt to christ
[34:58] he stopped the mouths of lions he
[34:59] quenched the violence of fire he escaped
[35:01] i mean they escape the edge of the sword
[35:03] they raise the dead from the grave who
[35:05] christ
[35:06] oh my what will it be who is he christ
[35:09] the deity
[35:10] and brother sister that deities and you
[35:12] who believes that tonight
[35:14] amen a little while the world saith me
[35:15] no more but yet you shall see me
[35:18] for i'll be with you even in you to the
[35:20] end of the age christ
[35:21] in the in the manger no christ in you
[35:23] hallelujah
[35:24] we're not worshiping christ in the
[35:26] manger but christ in you
[35:28] the holy ghost the hope of life
[35:30] hallelujah the creator
[35:31] god himself dwelling in the human being
[35:34] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[35:36] but
[35:36] we're but we'll see him as he is for
[35:39] will be made like him the spirit
[35:41] in the human being uh louis he says that
[35:45] we know that you know that may be
[35:46] kind of uh not uh rather elementary to
[35:49] us
[35:49] all but the same one that made sun moon
[35:51] and stars dwells in you
[35:53] it's not unless a god a different god
[35:55] it's the same one
[35:56] but you see gideon forgot his position
[35:59] remember he was a circumcised jew living
[36:02] under a covenant in the promised land
[36:04] but he forgot all about that and he was
[36:05] hiding away from the enemy and
[36:07] you know even even his name is is very
[36:10] telling in this because
[36:12] the name manasseh which is the tribe
[36:14] that he came from
[36:16] it means causing to forget that's what
[36:19] manasseh means
[36:20] so he was living by the name of his
[36:22] tribe causing to forget what was he
[36:24] forgetting who he was
[36:25] what god had made him to be what his
[36:27] birth made him amen as a circumcised
[36:30] son of abraham living in the promised
[36:32] land that was his ordained position but
[36:34] he forgot about that
[36:36] and his actions proved that he forgot
[36:38] about it now i love the name gideon to
[36:41] me it's pretty cool
[36:42] it means it means to uh it means a fella
[36:46] not you fella but a fella as in a
[36:48] warrior
[36:50] and that word comes from to foul a tree
[36:53] or generally to destroy anything
[36:56] that's his that's his first name he can
[36:58] just just destroy anything
[37:00] harley if he only had a revelation of
[37:02] the of the covenant he was meant to live
[37:04] under
[37:05] then he would have destroyed anything he
[37:07] would have been walking in power i mean
[37:08] because god made him that
[37:10] hallelujah so you know but the thing is
[37:12] he wasn't living by that name
[37:14] he was living by this name of of
[37:16] manasseh
[37:18] causing to forget so his circumstances
[37:21] and what everyone else in the church was
[37:22] doing around him caused him to forget
[37:24] his covenant with god
[37:26] and caused them to just hide away but
[37:30] it took the angel lord to come and visit
[37:32] him to awaken him to realize
[37:35] actually you're going to start living by
[37:36] your name gideon
[37:38] and you're going to destroy these hosts
[37:40] of midian as one man
[37:42] hallelujah that's why you know the devil
[37:44] brother that's why brother brown said it
[37:46] as i read the quote that you know it's
[37:48] time we recognize who we are
[37:51] you know i'm sure you know there'll come
[37:53] a time when our eyes come fully open
[37:55] we're really the reality of who we are
[37:57] right now because the scripture tells us
[37:59] now we're the sons of god
[38:00] not one day right now i mean but our
[38:03] eyes are going to come
[38:04] open i am a son of god i am a daughter
[38:05] of god i have
[38:07] i have a position and authority that the
[38:09] devil's got to back up he's got to give
[38:11] room he's got to be cast out he's got to
[38:13] leave
[38:13] in the name of jesus christ so you know
[38:16] the devil's trying to hide you back
[38:18] and that's what gideon was basically
[38:19] hidden back
[38:21] to tell you you're some little cow down
[38:24] something
[38:24] he says i'm the least of my in my
[38:26] father's house and i'm i'm from a very
[38:28] poor tribe
[38:29] what was that the devil trying to hide
[38:30] him back making some count down
[38:32] something
[38:33] but the angel came to him and said no
[38:34] you're a mighty man of valor
[38:36] go on this thymite you're that same
[38:38] angel that meant gideon is the same one
[38:40] that's came down in the end time
[38:42] hallelujah because that was god himself
[38:44] came down an angelic form to gideon
[38:47] amen amen so we we're going to recognize
[38:50] that deity is not just in heaven it's in
[38:52] you and i
[38:54] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[38:56] hallelujah now
[38:57] jesus we know jesus was fully god but he
[39:00] was fully man
[39:02] he had to be god because only god could
[39:04] fulfill his own word
[39:05] but he had to be fully man because he
[39:06] had to be our kinsmen redeemer
[39:08] but jesus had a revelation of who he was
[39:13] right he had jesus had perfect faith is
[39:16] from the message perfect faith
[39:18] jesus had perfect faith he had it
[39:22] uh and it come because he was the word
[39:25] and you become the word you become the
[39:27] word as you receive the word that's why
[39:29] it's a good ever welcoming spirit
[39:32] lord minister to me change my life to
[39:34] match your word
[39:36] if you abide in me and my words and you
[39:38] my words
[39:39] this word this word abides in you then
[39:42] ask what you will and it shall be done
[39:44] see
[39:44] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[39:46] don't doubt but believe what you've said
[39:48] then you shall have what you said amen
[39:51] when you pray believe that you receive
[39:53] what you ask for you shall have it it
[39:55] will be given to you
[39:56] space time nothing else will ever change
[39:59] it you know it's done
[40:01] it's already over with and when god
[40:03] anchors the revelation in your heart
[40:05] space and time don't matter you know
[40:06] it's already done
[40:08] hallelujah now watch now he said to us
[40:11] if you abide in me and my word and you
[40:13] saint john here
[40:14] you can ask what you will it'll be done
[40:17] then
[40:18] recognize your position in the scripture
[40:21] as a believer who's done that you know
[40:24] when i read about
[40:25] uh gideon and the midianites i don't
[40:27] identify as a midianite
[40:29] or a child of the east i don't identify
[40:32] those guys
[40:33] there's just nothing in me that says i'm
[40:34] one of them i'm so glad i can say i'm
[40:36] one of them i'm not one of them
[40:38] but i can identify with gideon having
[40:40] real struggles with my humanity
[40:42] and my circumstances and what my five
[40:44] senses declare
[40:45] but then i can i can identify when
[40:47] gideon when god comes to him
[40:49] and speaks to him and says you're a
[40:50] mighty man of allah i mean you're more
[40:52] than what you think you are
[40:54] and now i'm going to begin to show you
[40:55] what's in you and this is what the lord
[40:57] is here to do that's what this mess has
[40:59] actually come to do
[41:00] is show the bride what's already in here
[41:03] amen what did brother braham say that we
[41:05] had we received a wedding band
[41:07] of unmerited pre-disney grace before the
[41:10] foundation of the world
[41:11] but we had to come to a place where our
[41:13] eyes came open we realized by revelation
[41:16] i do have that wedding band on i'm you
[41:19] know i'm i'm
[41:20] i'm i'm built to fit the role as the
[41:23] bride
[41:24] hallelujah so he says then recognize
[41:27] your position in the scripture as a
[41:29] believer
[41:30] have we done that amen then you've got
[41:33] to recognize your position as he
[41:35] recognized his position
[41:38] hallelujah amen brother ban would say in
[41:41] the church age book the first chapter
[41:42] the revelation of jesus christ he says
[41:44] now
[41:45] as i've already said this book the
[41:47] revelation is a consummation of the
[41:48] scripture
[41:49] it is it is even placed exactly right in
[41:52] the canon of scripture at the end
[41:54] now you can know why it says that anyone
[41:56] who reads
[41:57] or even hears it is blessed it is the
[41:59] revelation of god
[42:01] that will give you authority over the
[42:04] devil
[42:05] and you can see why they who would add
[42:08] or take from it would be cursed
[42:10] it would have to be so for who can add
[42:13] or take away from the perfect revelation
[42:15] of god
[42:16] and overcome the enemy it is that simple
[42:18] there is nothing
[42:19] as such prevailing power as the
[42:22] revelation
[42:23] of the word there's prevailing power in
[42:26] revelation that's why the prophet says
[42:28] you should pray for revelation more than
[42:30] anything and it's very vital say lord
[42:32] reveal who you are
[42:33] in the word and reveal who i am and you
[42:36] in the word
[42:37] because that will give you prevailing
[42:39] power what did the angel come to gideon
[42:41] to do to give him revelation you're a
[42:42] mighty man of valor
[42:44] goldness thy might you're going to
[42:46] deliver israel as one man
[42:48] it was already locked within him but it
[42:49] took an angelic visitation to actually
[42:52] reveal the warrior within him amen
[42:55] it takes the same thing with you and i
[42:56] you know there's an overcomer locked
[42:58] within us
[42:59] amen it's already that person's already
[43:02] there maybe just dormant but you know
[43:04] but when the holy ghost comes the word
[43:06] comes and begins to spring to life
[43:08] and we begin to really realize actually
[43:10] we had overcome
[43:11] we're made to overcome we're purpose
[43:13] built to overcome
[43:14] hallelujah and so
[43:17] there's nothing as prevailing there's
[43:20] nothing as such prevailing power as the
[43:22] revelation of the word
[43:23] what caused david to prevail over
[43:25] goliath revelation
[43:27] what caused him to prevail even over
[43:29] saul and his tricks
[43:30] revelation what was the revelation i'm
[43:33] king i'm going to sit on the throne
[43:36] amen so it didn't matter what was coming
[43:38] in in his life there's a lot of dangers
[43:39] david faced but here prevailing
[43:41] revelation lord
[43:42] you anointed me by a vindicated proven
[43:45] prophet of israel
[43:46] that i was gonna sit on the throne and
[43:48] be king and your spirit confirmed the
[43:50] word to me with signs following
[43:53] hallelujah i'm on my way to the throne
[43:56] and nothing could stop him getting there
[43:57] but he had a lot of trouble getting
[43:59] there
[43:59] right but his his revelation prevailed
[44:02] over his circumstances
[44:04] and that's going to be the same thing
[44:05] with you and i the revelation of who we
[44:07] are in the word
[44:08] amen will prevail over all circumstances
[44:12] if you lean lean to your revelation as
[44:15] opposed to your five senses
[44:17] amen hallelujah
[44:21] now he says in the same chapter i
[44:24] believe this bible is accurate
[44:26] amen jesus completely authenticated the
[44:29] old testament
[44:30] uh when here on earth and was uh and it
[44:33] was compiled exactly
[44:35] as was our new testament make no mistake
[44:38] about it we have the infallible word of
[44:40] god today and no man dares to add
[44:42] uh take from it or add to it but we need
[44:45] the same spirit that gave it to teach it
[44:47] to us
[44:48] oh how we need the revelation by the
[44:51] spirit we don't need a new bible
[44:53] we don't need a new translation though
[44:55] some are very good and not
[44:56] and i'm not against them but we need the
[44:59] revelation of the spirit and thank god
[45:02] we can have what we need for god wants
[45:04] to reveal his word
[45:06] to us by his spirit may god begin by his
[45:10] spirit to give us
[45:11] continuous life-giving and prevailing
[45:14] revelation
[45:15] oh if the church could only get a fresh
[45:17] revelation
[45:18] and become and and become by it the
[45:21] living word manifested
[45:23] we would do the greater works and
[45:24] glorify god our father
[45:27] in heaven amen but now the thing is
[45:31] amnesia can
[45:33] set in if you haven't listened to a
[45:35] sermon that really
[45:36] packs a lot of punch listen to spiritual
[45:38] amnesia
[45:40] it's a very powerful message brother
[45:41] brown only preaches it once was a very
[45:43] powerful message
[45:44] and he says one of the one of the
[45:46] problems you know
[45:47] amnesia comes from from a variety of
[45:50] things
[45:51] he says now this amnesia it means you
[45:54] can
[45:55] you can come to a place where you cannot
[45:56] identify yourself
[45:58] it's an unusual thing it don't happen
[46:01] too often
[46:02] but the causes is from shock now not
[46:05] just shell shock like a
[46:07] wall but shock stress it's sometimes it
[46:10] uh that it's somebody that don't even
[46:13] know who they
[46:14] are you find it in war sometimes
[46:16] soldiers get it sometimes people get it
[46:18] another thing cause it is worry worry
[46:21] will cause
[46:22] amnesia so worry will cause a person to
[46:25] forget who they are in the lord
[46:28] right because this is what he's talking
[46:29] about spiritual amnesia
[46:31] we're not immune from these things but
[46:33] we have overcoming power to overcome
[46:34] them
[46:35] amy because remember there's no bomb too
[46:37] big there's no shock too great there's
[46:39] no hardship that's
[46:40] too terrible that god could not take you
[46:42] through and make you a better christian
[46:44] because of it
[46:45] amen so you know there's the yeah
[46:47] there's nothing that can
[46:48] leave us in a crippled state but we will
[46:50] be uh yeah we will overcome
[46:52] worry so worry will cause it worry has
[46:55] no virtue to it at all
[46:57] yeah just skip worry and accept faith i
[46:59] like how he says that
[47:00] just oh there's worry then there's faith
[47:02] just skip worry and go to faith
[47:05] amen hallelujah it's like playing
[47:07] monopoly and you get a you know a
[47:08] chance card you go around you skip a
[47:10] whole bunch of stuff and you get to go
[47:11] whatever yo just skip
[47:13] skip worry and go to faith someone said
[47:16] well now
[47:16] what if i'm going to be shot in the
[47:18] morning wouldn't you worry
[47:20] i said no i don't think so why i said
[47:22] worry won't do nothing but make me worse
[47:25] you know i think we've had that
[47:26] conversation i had it with the girls i
[47:28] said
[47:28] there's no one in the history of
[47:30] humanity that worries helped
[47:33] no one it's a proven fact that's not
[47:35] fake news
[47:36] that that's true but faith has helped
[47:39] many people
[47:40] we have a testimony here testimony here
[47:42] where faith has come on the scene
[47:44] and delivered amen helped
[47:47] guided strengthened amen so he says well
[47:51] what good is it to have faith i said it
[47:54] might deliver me
[47:55] and that's right see so worry has no
[47:57] virtue to it at all but
[47:59] faith has all virtue belief amen bc
[48:02] worry will sometimes cause it now
[48:04] another thing that it will cause among
[48:06] people
[48:07] is getting between two opinions that'll
[48:10] cause
[48:10] amnesia is the word right is it wrong
[48:14] is the message true is it false is jesus
[48:18] real
[48:19] is he not is this just my parents thing
[48:21] or is he
[48:22] real to me are my friends right or am i
[48:25] right you know my parents writer is the
[48:27] society right
[48:28] you know there's these many things can
[48:30] be two opinions
[48:32] is he still the same or is he different
[48:34] does he still save that way
[48:35] is he saying is he the same god we're
[48:37] here on tape is he the same today or is
[48:39] he not there could be two opinions
[48:41] he's the same today he hasn't changed
[48:43] one iota he cannot change that's one
[48:45] thing god cannot do
[48:46] one thing he cannot lie one thing he
[48:48] cannot change this
[48:49] those things are impossibility with god
[48:52] he cannot do those things so it's
[48:53] getting between two opinions
[48:55] will cause amnesia and it will get you
[48:58] to a place you actually what you've done
[49:00] you've lost your reasons
[49:02] what should be the christian's reasons
[49:04] the word is true
[49:05] that should be our reason god is right
[49:08] the word is true
[49:10] amen you've lost your mind you can't you
[49:13] don't know who you are you can't
[49:14] identify yourself you can walk around
[49:16] eating everything
[49:17] but still you can't identify yourself
[49:19] you have got your scholarly education
[49:22] some education you had but you don't
[49:24] know where it come from
[49:25] you don't know who you are where you
[49:27] belong it's amnesia
[49:28] so we are told but familiar places in
[49:33] the scripture bring
[49:34] a break in amnesia right familiar places
[49:37] just like brother
[49:38] would tell the story of the soldier that
[49:40] got shell shock and the war forgot who
[49:42] he was and
[49:43] and they put a whole bunch of them on a
[49:44] railroad car and they were going to take
[49:46] them to a mental asylum
[49:48] and then they you know the train stopped
[49:49] at a certain station and they let the
[49:51] prisoners out
[49:52] and then one of them began to look
[49:53] around different to the others and begin
[49:55] to look at different landmarks and begin
[49:57] to walk
[49:58] and one of the guards was going to stop
[49:59] him but the other guard said
[50:01] just follow him see where he goes and he
[50:04] begins to walk here he goes down the
[50:05] hill he sees a water tank or something
[50:07] and he stops looks and then he
[50:08] goes down this other path he comes to a
[50:10] house he finally says going up the steps
[50:13] to the house an old man comes out the
[50:14] front door
[50:15] amen and he says son i always believe
[50:17] you'd come home given a big hug
[50:19] and then when that happened brother ram
[50:20] says the amnesia and the soldier broke
[50:22] and he realized who he was
[50:24] why because familiar places brought him
[50:26] back to his father
[50:27] it's the same thing in the word familiar
[50:29] places in the world will take you back
[50:30] to your heavenly father
[50:32] it'll break the amnesia and you'll
[50:34] realize you're a son or daughter of god
[50:36] well that's why it's so important to
[50:38] keep your eyes
[50:40] on the word it will show you who you are
[50:43] it'll tell you who you're not like i
[50:45] said i'm not a midianite
[50:47] the word tells me i'm not a midianite
[50:49] i'm a believer
[50:51] amen so we don't want to be between two
[50:54] opinions but the devil will try
[50:56] to get us between two opinions he will
[50:58] try and
[50:59] he will try and get us to worry right
[51:01] because he wants to make us forget who
[51:03] we are
[51:03] because if we know who we are the
[51:05] devil's whipped
[51:06] hallelujah amen but if he gets us
[51:09] between two opinions different ideas
[51:11] just like
[51:12] he'll make us like gideon in a cave
[51:14] somewhere threshing weed in secret
[51:16] instead of driving the enemy off our
[51:18] inheritance
[51:20] hallelujah you know you know the bible
[51:22] says there's nothing impossible
[51:24] with man all things are possible to them
[51:27] that believe
[51:29] there's so so that means there's nothing
[51:31] impossible with the believer
[51:33] brotherham says in the patmos vision he
[51:36] says do you know man is omnipotent that
[51:38] means all powerful
[51:39] do you know man is omnipotent he says
[51:42] when two
[51:43] i'll just read this is amen cut every
[51:46] obstacle from human beings that they
[51:47] might be connected like in the garden of
[51:49] eden that's why lord jesus did that down
[51:51] calvary
[51:51] cut every obstacle away to unite us and
[51:54] him
[51:55] there's nothing you know there's no
[51:56] chasm between god and the believer
[51:58] there's no bridge there's no chasm he he
[52:01] just fills the chasm
[52:02] amen he he rips down the wall i think it
[52:05] was i think it was reagan or
[52:06] one of the presidents said you know you
[52:08] know when the berlin wall was built or i
[52:10] mean there he went to berlin
[52:12] he said tear down this wall and that's
[52:14] what jesus did he tore down that wall
[52:16] between
[52:17] us and us and god amen there's no more
[52:20] wall no more
[52:22] hallelujah amen so he says here cut
[52:25] every obstacle from human beings that
[52:27] they might be connected like in the
[52:28] garden of eden
[52:29] now man i was going to choke it but i'm
[52:31] going to say it man is omnipotent
[52:34] you don't believe that but he is a man
[52:37] fully surrendered to god is omnipotent
[52:40] so a man fully surrendered to god is
[52:41] all-powerful
[52:43] amen did not he said mark 11 22
[52:46] whatsoever things ye say
[52:48] and don't doubt in your heart will come
[52:50] to pass you can have what you've said
[52:52] what happens when two omnipotents meet
[52:55] when god and man comes together to
[52:57] omnipotent something's got to shake
[53:00] whatsoever you'd say with that creative
[53:02] power of omnipotence of god knowing that
[53:04] he promised it
[53:05] and he said it in his word it creates a
[53:07] power that goes out yonder and brings
[53:09] things to pass
[53:10] things that is not it makes them as
[53:12] though they are because
[53:14] two omnipotents have met there he stands
[53:16] oh isn't he wonderful the prophet says
[53:19] she says that when two omnipotents come
[53:21] together something's got to shake
[53:23] though yeah and and then when a word a
[53:25] creative power of a word is spoken under
[53:27] that anointing
[53:29] though things may appear as totally
[53:31] opposite they will be changed until they
[53:33] become what is spoken
[53:35] i'm talking about you right now this is
[53:37] not next year this is not some other
[53:39] time this is right now
[53:41] this is what is in you right now it's
[53:43] not coming it's here
[53:44] i mean we don't need another messenger
[53:46] to come to finish the mystery of god
[53:48] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[53:50] angel the mystery of god should be
[53:51] finished
[53:51] as he declared to his servants the
[53:53] prophets amen and that's already done
[53:55] that seventh angel has come and gone we
[53:56] have the jesus christ the word is with
[53:58] us now
[53:59] and he wants to open our eyes to show us
[54:01] who we are
[54:03] amen that we would find our position as
[54:05] believers
[54:07] hallelujah so if when two omnipotents
[54:09] come together something's got to shake
[54:11] a man fully surrendered to god is
[54:13] omnipotent
[54:15] amen but the devil doesn't want us to
[54:17] realize we're all powerful
[54:18] i mean because if we realize we're all
[54:20] powerful the devil is totally defeated
[54:24] amen hallelujah i we might as well call
[54:27] our
[54:28] call all our names gideon amen can
[54:31] destroy
[54:32] literally anything hallelujah
[54:37] amen we're we are not of manasseh
[54:40] we haven't caught we haven't been caused
[54:41] to forget i remember the lord has come
[54:44] to make us remember
[54:46] where were you before the foundation of
[54:47] the world where the morning stars
[54:49] shatter for joy and all
[54:50] you're in my mind bride you're in my
[54:52] mind
[54:54] amen jesus said if thou cast believe all
[54:56] things are possible to him the believer
[54:58] that's mark 9 23
[55:00] then mark 10 24 and the disciples were
[55:01] astonished at his words
[55:03] but jesus answereth again and said unto
[55:05] them children
[55:06] how hard is it for them that trust and
[55:08] riches to enter into the kingdom of god
[55:11] then the next verse it's easier for a
[55:12] camel to go through the eye of a needle
[55:14] than for a rich man to enter into the
[55:16] kingdom of god
[55:17] and they were astonished out of measure
[55:20] this is the disciples reaction they were
[55:22] they are beyond astonished
[55:23] they are more than shocked they are
[55:25] astonished out of measure saying among
[55:27] themselves
[55:28] who then can be saved and jesus looked
[55:31] upon them saith with men it is
[55:33] impossible but not with god
[55:35] for with god all things are possible
[55:38] i mean so with god all things are
[55:40] possible we may think something's
[55:42] impossible with god it's possible
[55:44] hallelujah now we are the word made
[55:48] flesh today
[55:49] right we are the living epistle of some
[55:52] word
[55:53] it can be either of the world it can be
[55:55] a philosophy
[55:56] or it can be the bible the message of
[55:58] the hour right
[55:59] the apostle paul would say in 2nd
[56:01] corinthians 3 do we
[56:03] begin again to commend ourselves or need
[56:05] we as some other
[56:06] others epistles of commendation to you
[56:08] or letters of combination
[56:10] unto you ye are our epistles written in
[56:12] our hearts known and read of all men
[56:15] for as much as ye are manifestly
[56:17] declared to be the epistle of christ
[56:19] ministered by us written not with ink
[56:22] but with the spirit of the living god
[56:23] not in tables of stone
[56:25] but in fleshly tables of the hearts the
[56:28] apostle paul is telling them the word
[56:30] that we ministered you are now
[56:31] manifesting
[56:33] right so the word that was spoken is now
[56:35] being written in their hearts by the
[56:37] holy ghost it's being lived out of them
[56:40] hallelujah amen he says and we trust
[56:44] that we through christ to godward not
[56:46] that we are sufficient of ourselves to
[56:48] think anything of ourselves but our
[56:50] sufficiency is of
[56:51] of god who also has made us able
[56:54] ministers of the new testament not of
[56:56] the letter
[56:57] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[56:59] but the spirit
[57:00] giveth life so they were living the true
[57:04] believers in those days were
[57:05] living manifestation of paul's epistles
[57:08] right so when you saw
[57:10] the ephesian church i mean the ephesian
[57:12] church was a living functioning
[57:14] group before it was written off in the
[57:16] ephe you know in the epistle to ephesus
[57:18] right
[57:19] right they were functioning that way
[57:21] before paul wrote that letter
[57:22] the corinthians already had their
[57:24] trouble right
[57:26] before paul wrote that letter because of
[57:28] carnality
[57:29] they weren't like the ephesian church
[57:31] right but all the true believers
[57:33] down through the ages have become the
[57:35] living word for their day
[57:37] so what paul could have said is instead
[57:39] of reading these letters
[57:41] look at these people because they're
[57:43] manifesting what i've written in these
[57:45] letters
[57:46] amen and it should be the same thing
[57:48] with you and i where the bible is no
[57:50] longer
[57:50] ink on paper but when people see you
[57:53] they should be able to see genesis the
[57:54] revelation
[57:56] they should see the revelation of jesus
[57:57] christ contained in a vessel
[58:00] amen shouldn't it be that way if we are
[58:02] if we are written epistles written known
[58:03] of all men
[58:04] i mean not not with ink but by the
[58:06] spirit of god where the word
[58:08] has become flesh and you and i
[58:11] hallelujah
[58:12] amen brother ram says this in the
[58:14] masterpiece
[58:16] he says when we're living epistles or in
[58:19] other words we are the epistles that's
[58:21] living
[58:22] that's been written and now living out
[58:24] the word of god as he promised in the
[58:26] hour manifested word epistles written
[58:28] that's been living out that's what the
[58:30] apostles was
[58:31] that's what john the baptist was he was
[58:33] the voice of one crying in the
[58:35] wilderness
[58:35] he tried to tell them that he also was
[58:37] malachi 3 behold
[58:39] i see my messenger before my face
[58:41] prepare the way before the people he was
[58:43] that living word
[58:44] and the true born-again church in this
[58:46] hour is the living word of god
[58:48] it's the word of this age made manifest
[58:51] search the scriptures
[58:52] see what's supposed to be in this age
[58:54] there is christ living again
[58:57] just changing his mask from one to
[59:00] another
[59:01] amen he says in the same this is in uh
[59:04] oh this is the masterpiece now notice
[59:06] the bride
[59:07] if the bride in the beginning was the
[59:08] word or the bridegroom then if the bride
[59:10] is taken out of the bridegroom
[59:12] it must be the word also notice the
[59:14] bride must be
[59:17] why must the bridegroom be the word
[59:18] manifested made plain
[59:20] is because the bride and the bridegroom
[59:23] are one
[59:24] she's just a smitten piece off of him
[59:28] there is the masterpiece so if jesus
[59:30] christ our bridegroom is the word then
[59:31] the bride is
[59:32] will be the word also are you all
[59:34] following me tonight
[59:36] right so so if he was the bible made
[59:38] flesh so we will be the bible made flesh
[59:40] what i'm saying these thing is that we
[59:41] need to be we need to be i trust you're
[59:43] not like gideon threshing wheat just
[59:45] trying to survive through ladies see you
[59:47] and
[59:47] keep things to yourself and just
[59:48] hopefully the devil will be dealt with
[59:50] by someone and just trying to survive
[59:52] and
[59:53] no no we're gonna we're either our eyes
[59:56] should come open
[59:57] where we should realize by angelic
[59:59] visitation
[1:00:00] you're a mighty people of allah you're
[1:00:02] made to overcome
[1:00:03] as jesus overcame all temptation amen as
[1:00:06] he
[1:00:07] overcame all demon power or religious
[1:00:09] power
[1:00:10] all social power everything that was in
[1:00:12] the world came against him and he
[1:00:13] conquered hell death and the grave he
[1:00:15] overcame all those things
[1:00:16] he was the word and he overcame so the
[1:00:19] brightest she receives the word becomes
[1:00:20] the word
[1:00:21] and that overcoming power comes into her
[1:00:24] and she overcomes
[1:00:25] all hell death in the grave as well i
[1:00:27] mean why because he
[1:00:28] she is part of him so through him the
[1:00:31] apostle paul said i'm more than a
[1:00:32] conqueror through christ
[1:00:34] amen and he knew who he was
[1:00:37] we're here to know who we are amen uh
[1:00:42] remember this is how god sees you how
[1:00:43] you see you is probably very different
[1:00:45] to how god sees you
[1:00:46] we need to change it lord may we see
[1:00:48] ourselves as you see us
[1:00:49] as the scripture says that there will
[1:00:51] come a day when we are we know as we are
[1:00:53] known
[1:00:54] so as god knows us we shall know in the
[1:00:56] same way so if he knows me as a
[1:00:58] sinner sinless virtuous bride of jesus
[1:01:01] christ made his image wash the blood and
[1:01:03] lamb
[1:01:03] no spot or wrinkle or any such thing and
[1:01:06] there's nothing held against me
[1:01:08] you know the old account was sitting
[1:01:09] long ago washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:01:11] there's no sin attributed to me i'm a
[1:01:13] more than a conqueror through christ
[1:01:15] i'm an overcomer i'm victorious if he
[1:01:17] sees me that way
[1:01:19] lord may i know as i am known
[1:01:22] right because remember god does not
[1:01:24] change his thinking about you and i
[1:01:26] if god thought of me that way remember
[1:01:29] you know i think i've said it before i
[1:01:30] have you know
[1:01:31] where when jesus spoke to this age he
[1:01:33] said to him that overcometh
[1:01:36] will will sit down with me in my throne
[1:01:38] as i overcame and sat down
[1:01:40] in my father's throne when he spoke that
[1:01:42] to john on the isle of patmos he had in
[1:01:44] his mind
[1:01:45] who was going to be those overcomers it
[1:01:48] wasn't just a term he just threw out
[1:01:50] there and hopefully someone would
[1:01:51] meet the criteria he knew exactly who
[1:01:54] would manifest
[1:01:55] that scripture right so i pray god may i
[1:01:58] know
[1:02:00] as i'm known i believe i believe i'm one
[1:02:03] of those group do you believe you're in
[1:02:04] that number
[1:02:05] that blood wash number irrespective of
[1:02:08] how you know that's why we say lord
[1:02:10] change my thinking
[1:02:11] that i don't see myself as i see myself
[1:02:13] and my failures and my humanity and
[1:02:16] what's going on in my life and my
[1:02:17] personality and all those things
[1:02:19] don't don't let me look at myself like
[1:02:22] that
[1:02:23] let me look at me how you see me
[1:02:27] amen i think it's a good prayer to have
[1:02:29] then the lord began to open your eyes
[1:02:31] and say
[1:02:31] child your father you're worth your
[1:02:33] souls worth more than ten thousand
[1:02:35] worlds
[1:02:36] i mean my very purpose upon the earth is
[1:02:38] to gather you to myself and
[1:02:39] myself to reveal you know myself to you
[1:02:42] and walk with you and then fight your
[1:02:43] battles and comfort you when you're
[1:02:45] trouble and
[1:02:46] give you counsel when you're worried and
[1:02:48] you know give you rest when you're wary
[1:02:49] and heal you when you're sick and
[1:02:51] you'll guide you through all of life's
[1:02:53] journey do you know he is you know we
[1:02:55] are
[1:02:55] we are the purpose of his being his very
[1:02:58] heart
[1:02:59] you know you see people get tripped up
[1:03:01] with the godhead where it says in
[1:03:02] genesis how it says
[1:03:04] let us make man in our image and then
[1:03:07] when god is done making man in his image
[1:03:09] because that's how it's a purity there
[1:03:11] so therefore that shows the trinity no
[1:03:13] because when you see what god made in
[1:03:14] his image he made one spirit
[1:03:17] and then that and that and that one
[1:03:18] spirit man became one person
[1:03:21] but within that one person was a woman
[1:03:23] was his heart was
[1:03:24] was was sealed away but then that wasn't
[1:03:27] god wasn't satisfied with that he wanted
[1:03:29] to manifest
[1:03:30] his heart and then eve became flesh
[1:03:34] wasn't it different it was actually a
[1:03:36] part of adam coming out
[1:03:38] and becoming the woman hallelujah it's
[1:03:41] the same thing with you and i
[1:03:42] we're actually a part of god amen we're
[1:03:45] not just
[1:03:46] people that he's just kind of gathered
[1:03:47] haphazardly no he's been looking for his
[1:03:50] attributes looking for parts of himself
[1:03:52] and that's why when the word comes your
[1:03:53] way it speaks to you like it maybe
[1:03:55] doesn't speak to other people
[1:03:56] it's because god is trying to tell you
[1:03:58] one of my eagles you one of my children
[1:04:00] i want you a lord open our eyes that we
[1:04:02] would see and we would know as we are
[1:04:04] known
[1:04:05] amen i trust this is
[1:04:08] this is this is not going over your head
[1:04:10] you may say this is kind of but i see
[1:04:12] myself as this big
[1:04:13] well say just turn your vision a little
[1:04:16] bit
[1:04:18] and say lord show me who i am
[1:04:22] because remember what he says remember
[1:04:23] he is judge jury and executioner
[1:04:27] right what he says goes there's no
[1:04:30] there's no jury oh yeah i'm just trying
[1:04:32] to say it's not a democracy in heaven
[1:04:34] if he says the sky is going to be blue
[1:04:36] it was blue
[1:04:37] right and that's it you know it didn't
[1:04:40] you know there wasn't a war i think
[1:04:41] that's not right no no because he said
[1:04:43] it's blue
[1:04:44] right and if he's judged someone sinless
[1:04:47] virtuous
[1:04:48] no spider wrinkle against them then
[1:04:50] nothing can come against to say no hold
[1:04:52] on that's wrong the devil tries
[1:04:54] but the apostle paul says who can lay
[1:04:57] charge to god's elect that's god that
[1:04:58] justifies
[1:05:00] so what he says about you and i is the
[1:05:02] only thing that matters
[1:05:04] not what we say about ourselves not what
[1:05:05] the devil says about ourselves
[1:05:07] what god says
[1:05:10] amen now he says in the identified
[1:05:14] masterpiece of god he says now he's the
[1:05:16] word
[1:05:16] he he's always the same and your spirit
[1:05:20] has to punctuate that within
[1:05:21] with amen oh he in my way he is
[1:05:26] in every way he's the same yesterday
[1:05:28] today and forever
[1:05:29] now we notice that god began to make a
[1:05:31] bride for christ
[1:05:32] and the bride must be identified with
[1:05:34] him and in him because
[1:05:36] it's a part of him now the brightest
[1:05:38] part of him
[1:05:39] she is part of him the word for that day
[1:05:42] the bride
[1:05:42] becomes part of that word for it's
[1:05:44] christ now you believe that
[1:05:46] we have to be in christ in christ we
[1:05:48] have to be of christ
[1:05:50] in christ part of christ actually
[1:05:52] speaking about all the same thing there
[1:05:53] what is a woman when she takes a man or
[1:05:55] a man takes a woman
[1:05:57] that woman has to be part of him they're
[1:05:59] no longer two they're one
[1:06:01] and when god and christ has become one
[1:06:04] they were one
[1:06:05] because god pardon me was the word and
[1:06:06] the word was made flesh
[1:06:09] the flesh and the word become one and
[1:06:11] when the church
[1:06:13] becomes christ's bride she and the
[1:06:16] gospels
[1:06:17] are the same she
[1:06:20] and the gospels are the same so instead
[1:06:24] of reading matthew mark luke and john
[1:06:26] you can read the believer's life she and
[1:06:28] the gospels are the same
[1:06:30] how can you say that in the days of
[1:06:32] miracles was past how can you say then
[1:06:34] he's not the same yesterday today and
[1:06:35] forever
[1:06:36] how can you say those things is for the
[1:06:38] apostles or a disciple or somebody in
[1:06:41] another day
[1:06:42] when you're part of him
[1:06:45] amen are we all here today
[1:06:48] well i'm talking about you right because
[1:06:51] he said you say well well
[1:06:53] that's that's that's way out of left
[1:06:54] field no it's not because in ephesians 5
[1:06:57] it says we are members of his body and
[1:06:59] of his flesh and of his bones
[1:07:01] for this cause shall a man leave his
[1:07:03] father and mother and shall be joined
[1:07:04] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[1:07:06] flesh
[1:07:07] this is a great mystery but i speak
[1:07:08] concerning christ
[1:07:10] and the church or the bride
[1:07:13] because we are members of his body of
[1:07:15] his flesh and of his bones
[1:07:17] remember if he overcame and we're part
[1:07:19] of him we're going to overcome
[1:07:22] right because his body is not going to
[1:07:24] do to do a different thing to
[1:07:25] to him right because we're one unit just
[1:07:28] like my head is connected to my body
[1:07:30] if there's a separation there'd be no
[1:07:32] life in either bit
[1:07:34] right that's not that's not crazy talk
[1:07:36] you know if there's a
[1:07:37] decapitation happen right now i'd be
[1:07:39] dead right but what my head does
[1:07:42] where my head goes my body goes right so
[1:07:45] if my head says walk over this way my
[1:07:48] body's going this way
[1:07:49] and vice versa back over here so if the
[1:07:52] lord
[1:07:53] conquered hell death in the grave and
[1:07:55] then he arose you know there's a song i
[1:07:57] was listening to
[1:07:58] ain't no grave can hold this body down
[1:08:00] and there's the bridge saying you know
[1:08:01] if you walk down the grave i'm walking
[1:08:03] too
[1:08:04] if you walk down the grave i'm walking
[1:08:06] too why because where his body and he's
[1:08:08] the head
[1:08:08] so if the head walked out of the grave i
[1:08:10] put it that way the body's going worth
[1:08:12] amen so nothing can hold this body down
[1:08:16] hallelujah amen colossians 1 and 26
[1:08:19] would say even the mystery which has
[1:08:21] been hit
[1:08:21] hit from ages and from generations but
[1:08:23] has now had made
[1:08:25] manifest to us his saints to whom god
[1:08:28] would make known what is the riches of
[1:08:30] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:08:31] gentiles
[1:08:32] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:08:36] now i just want to go quickly through
[1:08:38] how how how powerful real faith is
[1:08:41] now real faith is a revelation right
[1:08:44] it's not a hope so
[1:08:45] it's an oh so so it's not in here it's
[1:08:48] here
[1:08:49] it's when the word goes from here down
[1:08:50] to here and you know it's so
[1:08:52] right that's that's real faith now he
[1:08:55] says in the ever-present water from the
[1:08:57] rock
[1:08:58] he says now if there wasn't a law now
[1:09:02] now i just want to keep you in mind
[1:09:03] keep in mind i read in the beginning the
[1:09:05] one who made sun moon and stars is inner
[1:09:07] people
[1:09:08] right so the one who said let there be
[1:09:10] sun moon and stars isn't a people
[1:09:12] is it you and i it's not a different god
[1:09:14] unless a god the holy ghost is god
[1:09:18] right now that shouldn't be a shock to
[1:09:20] anyone he says now
[1:09:21] if there but there's a law that controls
[1:09:23] faith right
[1:09:24] if there wasn't a law to that sons and
[1:09:26] daughters of god could create them a
[1:09:28] world out there and go live a private
[1:09:30] life on it
[1:09:32] so that power's in you right now you may
[1:09:34] have heard this for years be gonna hear
[1:09:35] it one more time there's actually
[1:09:36] powering you to speak
[1:09:37] a private world into existence and go
[1:09:40] live on it we say
[1:09:41] let there be the milky way just like
[1:09:44] this one
[1:09:45] and then you just go from here onto that
[1:09:47] earth you're living a private life
[1:09:49] amen but see you have the power in you
[1:09:52] to do it
[1:09:54] right if you've got a shadow now this
[1:09:57] this really just struck me think about
[1:09:58] this if you've got a power of the shadow
[1:10:01] of god in you you've got power to do it
[1:10:03] so you can say let the wick say i am
[1:10:05] strong
[1:10:07] i mean let the wick say i'm strong so
[1:10:08] you ever say well i'm weak in faith no
[1:10:10] you're strong
[1:10:11] i'm just you know i'm just scraping
[1:10:13] through no you're strong
[1:10:15] because if you've got a shadow of the
[1:10:16] power of god in you you've got power to
[1:10:17] do it what's that
[1:10:18] create a world and live a private life
[1:10:20] on it
[1:10:21] god is omnipotent see what i mean the
[1:10:23] power that's in you will make
[1:10:25] you could speak a world into existence
[1:10:27] and go live on it hallelujah there you
[1:10:29] are
[1:10:30] that's what power is in the church now
[1:10:33] but it's controlled by a law and that
[1:10:35] law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:10:37] commandments it's a law of faith
[1:10:40] jesus said all things are possible to
[1:10:41] them that believe and if you can believe
[1:10:44] it whatsoever god will lead your soul to
[1:10:46] belief
[1:10:47] then that is yours every place that the
[1:10:50] souls you've ever felt can sit upon by
[1:10:52] faith god gives it to you
[1:10:53] so it should be it lord lead me to
[1:10:54] believe all things
[1:10:56] amen amen see
[1:11:00] um god gives it to you amen it's yours
[1:11:02] you possess it if you can find the key
[1:11:04] to this law of faith that opens it to
[1:11:06] you
[1:11:07] you see what i mean that power is
[1:11:09] controlled by if you're a son of god if
[1:11:11] you're a daughter of god that never
[1:11:13] leaves you
[1:11:14] it's with you all the time but your
[1:11:15] faith gets away from it
[1:11:17] but it's still there hallelujah when you
[1:11:19] are saved
[1:11:20] god gives you faith to rise from the
[1:11:23] muck of the earth
[1:11:24] your faith overcomes the things of the
[1:11:26] world what is your faith your faith is
[1:11:28] that act that god
[1:11:29] has did in you to make your son of god
[1:11:32] you quit your lying you quit your
[1:11:33] stealing you quit your drinking
[1:11:35] because your faith rises you above it
[1:11:37] amen if you don't do it you don't have
[1:11:39] any faith and by faith you're saved
[1:11:41] and that through grace as much as your
[1:11:43] faith will be released that's how much
[1:11:45] power you can have
[1:11:46] because then you dwell as the power to
[1:11:48] make heaven as an earth god dwells in
[1:11:50] you
[1:11:50] and ye are sons and daughters of god
[1:11:52] amen there you are
[1:11:53] but it's your faith jesus says according
[1:11:55] to your faith beard unto you
[1:11:57] if thou canst believe all things are
[1:11:59] possible verily i say unto you
[1:12:01] if you sound to this mountain be moved
[1:12:02] and don't doubt but believe what you've
[1:12:04] said
[1:12:05] then what kind of people ought we to be
[1:12:07] having faith in this great redeeming
[1:12:09] christ that lives in us
[1:12:10] this smitten rock that never leaves the
[1:12:12] church i am with you always
[1:12:14] even to the end of the world the ever
[1:12:16] presence of the great gusher of
[1:12:18] salvation and power
[1:12:19] that poured fall from calvary into the
[1:12:21] church the ever presence
[1:12:23] of the living god the great flowing
[1:12:25] smitten rock that goes with us
[1:12:27] in our journey now what is this
[1:12:30] no um he said as much he says now if you
[1:12:33] can find the key to this law of faith
[1:12:36] that opens it to you now what is this
[1:12:39] key
[1:12:39] that opens this to us he says and be as
[1:12:42] i be not afraid it says i believe that
[1:12:44] healing is a finished work
[1:12:46] that's been completed for 2 000 years
[1:12:48] when jesus died at calvary
[1:12:50] he saved you from sin and healed your
[1:12:52] sickness and every blessing
[1:12:54] redemptive blessing is yours by faith in
[1:12:57] that finished work it's yours
[1:12:59] if you can believe it so that is the key
[1:13:02] that opens up all these things
[1:13:04] faith in the finished work of calvary is
[1:13:05] the key to the door that opens every
[1:13:07] divine promise
[1:13:09] amen now faith cometh by hearing and
[1:13:12] hearing by the word of god
[1:13:13] that's why it's very important we sit
[1:13:15] under the word we listen to the message
[1:13:16] read the bible because faith comes by
[1:13:19] hearing and hearing by the word
[1:13:20] so if we hear the true word of god faith
[1:13:23] rises
[1:13:24] it doesn't go down it actually increases
[1:13:26] amen it increases that's what we want
[1:13:28] that the lord would increase our faith
[1:13:30] now faith has a lot of uh brother man
[1:13:33] describes it in many different ways
[1:13:35] he speaks when moses i'm just going to
[1:13:37] read a few quotes then we're going to
[1:13:39] then we're going to be done because
[1:13:40] time's run away moses with his faith
[1:13:42] never did fear
[1:13:43] pharaoh see he didn't care what pharaoh
[1:13:46] said he cared not about pharaoh
[1:13:48] no more than his mother and his daddy
[1:13:50] cared about their threats when moses was
[1:13:52] con what was confirmed to him and
[1:13:55] he was that person that would deliver
[1:13:57] egypt or let or lead
[1:13:59] israel out of egypt rather he never
[1:14:01] cared what moses said
[1:14:02] i mean so what pharaoh said he wasn't
[1:14:05] scared of him amen oh man you see what i
[1:14:07] mean
[1:14:07] there is no faith and there's no fear in
[1:14:10] faith
[1:14:12] faith knows about it remember faith is a
[1:14:14] revelation okay
[1:14:15] faith is as i've always said it's got
[1:14:17] great big muscles and hairs on his chest
[1:14:20] faith says shut up and everybody shuts
[1:14:23] up that's all
[1:14:24] i know where i'm at the rest him say
[1:14:26] well then maybe he does see
[1:14:28] but you've got to stand up and show your
[1:14:30] muscles that's all faith
[1:14:32] does it so faith tells our five senses
[1:14:35] to shut up
[1:14:37] don't listen to what you hear don't pay
[1:14:40] attention to what you see whatever
[1:14:41] symptoms you feel whatever memories you
[1:14:43] carry
[1:14:44] faith says shut up to all those things
[1:14:46] because faith just takes god at his word
[1:14:49] i mean so if there's no fear when god
[1:14:52] reveals it to you
[1:14:53] in faith he says this in preparation
[1:14:57] you believe it's preparation time don't
[1:15:00] notice your age
[1:15:01] don't notice the circumstances faith
[1:15:03] knows no age limit or circumstance
[1:15:06] faith knows one thing god sets on that
[1:15:08] settles it
[1:15:09] you believe it he says in the sin of
[1:15:11] unbelief the trouble of
[1:15:12] of it is with the church saying we come
[1:15:14] with hope instead of faith
[1:15:16] faith is positive faith needs no booster
[1:15:19] faith knows what it's talking about
[1:15:21] faith is strong
[1:15:22] faith has hairs on its chest it speaks
[1:15:24] the rest of them shut up
[1:15:25] symptoms can't even speak at all when
[1:15:27] real godly faith speaks
[1:15:29] it's got the flaw it knows where it's at
[1:15:32] it's had an experience
[1:15:33] and and faith is our victory he says
[1:15:36] real faith knows no defeat
[1:15:38] it cannot be defeated that's why faith
[1:15:40] is prevailing revelation is prevailing
[1:15:42] i mean it cannot be defeated even death
[1:15:44] itself can't defeat it
[1:15:46] it knows no defeat trials no defeat but
[1:15:49] faith knows no defeat
[1:15:50] it cannot be defeated and it's the only
[1:15:53] way that we can please god for that
[1:15:55] faith it's impossible to please god said
[1:15:57] hebrews 11.
[1:15:58] amen first john 5 and 3 for this is the
[1:16:00] love of god
[1:16:01] that we keep his commandments as
[1:16:03] commandments not grievous
[1:16:04] and what's and whatsoever is born of god
[1:16:07] overcometh the world
[1:16:08] and this is the victory that overcomes
[1:16:10] the world even our
[1:16:11] faith who is he that overcometh the
[1:16:14] world but he that believeth that jesus
[1:16:15] is the son of god so our faith is
[1:16:18] actually the key to victory that caused
[1:16:19] us to
[1:16:20] overcome revelation
[1:16:23] amen he says in perseverance she was
[1:16:26] persistent
[1:16:27] she stayed all day the undertaker's
[1:16:29] calling for a baby now this is by the
[1:16:31] way i'm talking about the woman
[1:16:33] in mexico with the dead baby you know
[1:16:35] the baby died early in the morning but
[1:16:36] but you know
[1:16:37] went to the doctor it was dead but she
[1:16:39] got into the meeting got past all the
[1:16:41] deacons and the ushers and things
[1:16:43] because she know if she could just get
[1:16:44] to that man which was the prophet
[1:16:47] he would pray and the baby would come
[1:16:48] back to life so she was
[1:16:50] she had perseverance she was persistent
[1:16:53] amen the ushers tried to keep rather
[1:16:55] lined she stayed anyhow
[1:16:57] turned down every way but she stayed why
[1:17:00] she had perseverance why faith caught a
[1:17:02] hold
[1:17:03] faith faith said it's so and faith knows
[1:17:07] no difficult
[1:17:08] faith knows no defeat when you've got
[1:17:10] faith you have
[1:17:11] perseverance now you may have difficulty
[1:17:14] but faith doesn't know difficulty
[1:17:16] faith will take you through difficulty
[1:17:18] remember faith doesn't make it easy
[1:17:20] faith makes things possible amen faith
[1:17:23] doesn't take away obstacles but it gives
[1:17:25] away through the obstacle
[1:17:27] amen but we're going to be persevering
[1:17:29] whatever we're seeking god for we should
[1:17:30] keep seeking until we get it
[1:17:32] and keep knocking keep asking amen until
[1:17:34] you get what you have need of
[1:17:36] amen because remember faith is
[1:17:37] perseverant it puts a real backbone in a
[1:17:40] person puts a real anchor puts a real
[1:17:41] zeal in a real drive
[1:17:43] aiming that we'll get what we're seeking
[1:17:44] because why god has anchored in our
[1:17:46] hearts say lord i want to see it right
[1:17:47] now
[1:17:48] you may have given me the peace is going
[1:17:50] to happen but i want to sit back i want
[1:17:51] it right now lord
[1:17:52] just like caleb said let's go get the
[1:17:54] land right now let's go up right now and
[1:17:56] go get it
[1:17:56] why it was revealed to caleb the land
[1:17:58] was his
[1:18:00] hallelujah so the seraphinisian woman
[1:18:02] was this
[1:18:03] was was this kind of woman it's amazing
[1:18:06] you know it's amazing how faith goes
[1:18:10] beyond obstacle
[1:18:12] it says in matthew 15 and behold the
[1:18:13] woman of canaan came out of the same
[1:18:15] coast
[1:18:16] and cried unto him saying have mercy on
[1:18:18] me o lord thou son of david
[1:18:20] my daughter is grievously vexed with the
[1:18:22] devil
[1:18:24] but she answered her not a word now some
[1:18:26] people would say well god just isn't
[1:18:28] listening to me maybe i don't have faith
[1:18:29] maybe my prayers don't work and that
[1:18:31] quit
[1:18:32] but she she had a real faith that was
[1:18:35] perseverant
[1:18:36] she wasn't gonna leave the presence of
[1:18:38] the lord until she got what she needed
[1:18:41] because she knew that he had the answer
[1:18:44] but he didn't answer her a word and the
[1:18:46] disciples came and besought him now this
[1:18:48] is
[1:18:48] this is matthew 15 23. if you care to
[1:18:51] put it up that's fine
[1:18:52] and his disciples came and besought him
[1:18:54] saying send her away
[1:18:55] for she crieth after us but he answered
[1:18:59] and said i am not sent
[1:19:00] but unto the lost sheep of the house of
[1:19:02] israel in other words
[1:19:04] i'm not here to meet your need this was
[1:19:06] this was the lord's answer to this
[1:19:08] syria phoenician woman this this greek
[1:19:11] woman here
[1:19:12] i'm not come to you but she came
[1:19:16] and she worshiped him saying lord help
[1:19:18] me
[1:19:19] see she had perseverant faith
[1:19:23] this is gentile faith in action
[1:19:26] hallelujah
[1:19:27] and he answered and said it's not meat
[1:19:30] to take the children's bread and cast it
[1:19:32] to dogs
[1:19:33] so this is not even for you and and he's
[1:19:36] calling her a dog
[1:19:39] this is what he is calling her so
[1:19:42] she's been ignored she's been told this
[1:19:45] is not for her
[1:19:47] and then she's been called a dog
[1:19:50] but but see her faith knows no
[1:19:54] difficult using the prophet's language
[1:19:56] from the previous quote
[1:20:00] and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat
[1:20:03] of the crumbs which fall from their
[1:20:05] masters table so
[1:20:06] she has been willing lord if you call me
[1:20:08] a dog that's fine but i still want what
[1:20:10] i want
[1:20:11] i still yo surely a little some of these
[1:20:13] blessings will fall down the table
[1:20:14] sure the bread's for the people you're
[1:20:16] the family for israel but hey i want
[1:20:18] some crumbs and sure some will fall
[1:20:20] i'm here where the master chef is i'm
[1:20:23] here to the lord himself you know who
[1:20:24] puts the bread on the table
[1:20:25] you know but she she said sure some
[1:20:27] crumbs will fall down i'm just gonna
[1:20:29] hang because i know
[1:20:30] even one crumb of the word amen will
[1:20:32] deliver my daughter
[1:20:34] hallelujah then jesus answered said o
[1:20:37] woman greater thy faith
[1:20:39] oh remember he knew what was in her
[1:20:42] he knew what was in her you know but she
[1:20:45] she
[1:20:46] she had to go through this time to
[1:20:47] realize my faith is great
[1:20:51] remember the lord wants us to realize
[1:20:52] what's within us
[1:20:55] beard unto thee even as thou wilt and
[1:20:57] her daughter was made whole from that
[1:21:00] very hour
[1:21:01] why because her faith was persistent
[1:21:04] if you have faith you have perseverance
[1:21:07] you will press it until you get what you
[1:21:09] want
[1:21:11] no matter if the lord doesn't appear to
[1:21:12] be talking to you
[1:21:14] if he even tells you this is not for you
[1:21:16] you know
[1:21:17] the devil tries to put that down our
[1:21:19] neck and many people believe him
[1:21:21] it's not for you oh it's not for me they
[1:21:23] go their way this is the lord himself
[1:21:25] telling her this is not for you
[1:21:26] but she said i'm here anyway i've turned
[1:21:29] up i want what i
[1:21:30] i want what i've come to get even a
[1:21:32] crumble do i'll take a crumb
[1:21:34] see this is her faith her faith did not
[1:21:36] know any difficulty
[1:21:38] hallelujah because she knew
[1:21:41] her he was more important than her
[1:21:44] current state
[1:21:45] out not even in the economy of god
[1:21:49] amen brother i'm saying calling jesus on
[1:21:51] the scene this greek had heard these
[1:21:53] words she believed it
[1:21:55] she had many hindrances but her faith
[1:21:57] didn't have any
[1:21:58] faith knows no hindrance her faith had
[1:22:01] no hindrance
[1:22:02] she had but her faith didn't have
[1:22:05] you may have hindrances but if you've
[1:22:08] got faith it knows no defeat
[1:22:10] it's positive let's look at some of her
[1:22:13] hindrances just for a moment
[1:22:15] some of them might have been some of
[1:22:17] them might have said remember you're of
[1:22:19] a different race you're a greek sorry
[1:22:20] sorry phoenician by nation he's a jew in
[1:22:23] other words today they'd say
[1:22:24] your denomination is not having this
[1:22:26] revival it makes no difference your
[1:22:28] denomination whether it is or not
[1:22:30] that woman didn't care who's to know
[1:22:32] denomination it was she was a human
[1:22:34] being
[1:22:35] created by god and she had a need and
[1:22:37] she had faith and she was going to get
[1:22:38] it
[1:22:39] whether her denomination was cooperating
[1:22:40] not made her no difference
[1:22:42] she started off hallelujah
[1:22:46] he says in calling jesus on the scene
[1:22:48] genuine faith knows no defeat
[1:22:50] it's already done it's already over god
[1:22:53] see it so that finishes it you see god
[1:22:55] said so
[1:22:56] now it's the same thing any time when
[1:22:57] you really believe it
[1:22:59] that touches him
[1:23:03] hallelujah so gideon
[1:23:07] do you know who you are do you know who
[1:23:10] you are in the lord
[1:23:11] you say i've got a lot of difficulties
[1:23:13] no just let your faith rise
[1:23:15] because your faith will overcome those
[1:23:17] difficulties remember god doesn't take
[1:23:19] away the obstacle
[1:23:21] look at all the obstacles that the
[1:23:22] children of israel had from going from
[1:23:24] egypt
[1:23:24] to the promised land there's a lot of
[1:23:27] them
[1:23:28] there was pharaoh and his task masters
[1:23:30] there was pharaoh's armies
[1:23:32] there was the red sea there was the
[1:23:34] desert there was mount sinai
[1:23:35] there was the moabites there was the
[1:23:37] river jordan there was jericho there was
[1:23:39] ai there was all the amalekites the
[1:23:41] precious lights and the whatever rights
[1:23:42] of the land
[1:23:43] there was a lot of obstacles god didn't
[1:23:45] push them out of the way
[1:23:47] god said no no you go and take the lamb
[1:23:49] but i'll fight your battle so they had
[1:23:51] to
[1:23:51] they had to walk into the place god said
[1:23:54] he'll fight for you
[1:23:55] amen but he but they had to turn up

[1:24:01] hallelujah

[1:35:30] our eyes to who we are in you
[1:35:33] oh lord i pray father as as we read in
[1:35:36] the beginning the devil wants to push us
[1:35:38] into a corner make us be some cow down
[1:35:40] little something
[1:35:41] but lord we're not there we're believers
[1:35:42] lord you've made us believers you've
[1:35:44] made us overcomers
[1:35:46] and may we know ourselves as we know you
[1:35:49] may we not look in the mirror and think
[1:35:51] of ourselves as
[1:35:52] what we see in the mirror of god as lord
[1:35:55] as a gauge of
[1:35:56] our our our uh lord as
[1:35:59] as how you think we are because just
[1:36:01] like gideon lord he
[1:36:03] was hiding away in a cave threshing weed
[1:36:06] in secret the enemy was all around him
[1:36:07] but
[1:36:08] when you came to him oh god you told him
[1:36:10] that he was a mighty man of allah
[1:36:12] you told him to go in the power of his
[1:36:14] might lord you didn't say he would
[1:36:16] become a mighty man of valor you told
[1:36:18] him he was already a mighty man of allah
[1:36:21] and i believe that's the same thing lord
[1:36:23] with us as believers here
[1:36:25] we already are overcomers lord jesus
[1:36:28] because of what you have already done
[1:36:29] for us you made us to be overcomers
[1:36:31] you made us to be mighty men and women
[1:36:33] of valor lord jesus
[1:36:35] through exploits in your name so lord i
[1:36:37] pray we would know
[1:36:39] as you know us o god and we would not
[1:36:41] know ourselves as we think we are
[1:36:43] but lord may how we see ourselves match
[1:36:46] how you see us oh god
[1:36:48] as overcomers lord jesus the devil under
[1:36:50] our feet
[1:36:51] more than conquerors through you washed

[1:37:01] that we are your workmanship lord jesus
[1:37:03] this is nothing that we could
[1:37:05] lord as you said when lord in the days
[1:37:07] of your flesh not one man can add a
[1:37:09] cubit to his stature

[1:37:17] this lord and glorifies us lord god we
[1:37:20] are your workmanship lord jesus we are
[1:37:22] the clay and you are the potter so
[1:37:24] may you continue to mold us and shape us
[1:37:26] may we feel
[1:37:27] lord your hands oh god on our clay as
[1:37:29] you molest and shape us more and more
[1:37:30] into your image
