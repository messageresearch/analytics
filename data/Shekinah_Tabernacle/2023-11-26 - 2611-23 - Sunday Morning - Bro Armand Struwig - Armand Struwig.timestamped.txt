[43:28] service for your glory and your kingdom
[43:30] in Jesus Christ's name our Lord and
[43:32] savior we pray
[43:34] amen amen thank you musicians I don't
[43:39] always get emotional but today is just
[43:41] very dear to my heart what the Lord has
[43:43] done for
[43:45] me it was a a time I was sitting at a
[43:48] desk I'll give you some
[43:49] background and Satan came and he said to
[43:52] me very clear he said to me you're not
[43:54] going to make it say you're going to
[43:57] fail and this heaviness this very heavy
[44:02] Spirit came into the room and you sat on
[44:04] me
[44:06] heavy you know what I did I started
[44:09] singing that song that brother Isaac
[44:11] just
[44:12] sang and immediately that Spirit
[44:16] left but see we kind of always look at
[44:20] the obvious we always look at the seen
[44:23] But I challenge you today to look at the
[44:25] Unseen I challenge you today to get rid
[44:27] of this thinking here and let it get
[44:30] into hereu cuz remember what brother
[44:32] Bley said at Camp he says if the
[44:34] thinking is here and the thinking is
[44:36] wrong and you let it go into your heart
[44:38] it will manifest but if the thinking
[44:41] here is from God and the Heart Is
[44:42] Telling You there's something that needs
[44:44] to change then that let that come out
[44:46] let that be your control tower so
[44:49] whatever I'm saying or whatever I'm
[44:50] preaching if you don't want to take it
[44:52] just put it on the shelf for a while and
[44:54] say Lord reveal it unto me
[44:56] and he's faithful and true he will do it
[44:59] amen so we're going to go into um
[45:02] Matthew
[45:03] 11 that is our scripture for today I
[45:06] always got these lovely sticky notes I
[45:08] love the sticky notes brother kben says
[45:10] it brings out my
[45:13] eyes um and I thought Brothers I'm sorry
[45:16] I I had to shave because with that
[45:18] mustache nobody could take me serious so
[45:20] I thought you know what I'll just lose
[45:23] that mustache you know so I'm sorry I
[45:25] think one for the team but U yeah I
[45:28] thought the message today is is of a
[45:30] serious nature but it's a it's a
[45:33] beautiful message if you can take it and
[45:34] make it your own you will be blessed
[45:36] today I believe cuz I was blessed last
[45:38] night and this morning I woke up very
[45:41] early and I said Lord just put it
[45:43] together and he supernaturally just put
[45:44] it all together so I know the Lord is
[45:46] dealing can you receive it can you be
[45:49] awake enough and long enough in the
[45:51] service to receive it amen so we give
[45:55] you a little bit of backgr ground but
[45:56] we're just going to read that scripture
[45:57] first and then we're going to go into it
[45:59] Matthew
[46:01] 11 and then we're going to start there
[46:03] at verse
[46:06] 28 but I'm going to give you some
[46:08] background first so just hold that
[46:10] scripture we're going to let you stand
[46:11] just for a we
[46:13] while Book of Matthew there we go 11:28
[46:17] okay
[46:19] so here's the here's the book
[46:24] okay here's the verse come to me all you
[46:27] are weary and heavy that have heavy
[46:29] burdens and I will give you rest okay
[46:32] here's my scripture say at the time
[46:35] Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh
[46:37] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[46:40] thou has hid these things from the wise
[46:41] and prudent and has revealed him unto
[46:44] babes even so father for it seeth good
[46:47] in thy sight all things are delivered
[46:49] unto me of my father and no man knoweth
[46:53] the son but the father neither knoweth
[46:55] any any man the father save the son and
[46:58] he to whosoever the son will reveal
[47:02] him remember as much as we want in a
[47:06] human ability to do something God needs
[47:08] to step on the scene God needs to do the
[47:10] work God needs to reveal and then he
[47:13] says come to me all ye that labor and
[47:15] are heavy ladened and I will give you
[47:17] rest now brother Andy preached upon this
[47:20] Wednesday night and I said to Brother
[47:22] Andy you took my sermon again because
[47:24] God is De and God wants us is's is's
[47:27] paying a picture he's talking to us we
[47:30] should listen god brother Bly said if
[47:33] God repeats himself somebody ain't
[47:35] listening because if a dad has to repeat
[47:37] himself that mean that son is still not
[47:39] listen or that daughter to what he said
[47:41] the first time so that might mean that
[47:43] we need to start falling in line with
[47:45] what God is trying to tell us right here
[47:48] he says take my yoke upon you and learn
[47:51] of me for I meek and lonely heart and ye
[47:55] shall find rest unto your souls for my
[47:58] yoke is easy and my burden lie let's
[48:01] just pray again Lord Jesus we've opened
[48:03] your word and we ask Lord that you would
[48:05] now step forth Lord the word itself the
[48:08] bread Lord may it fall now upon our laps
[48:11] Lord may we start eating that bread of
[48:12] life Lord Jesus and Lord I pray that you
[48:15] will just take everything now Lord into
[48:18] your control for the glory of our name
[48:21] of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[48:23] for your kingdom amen you may have your
[48:26] beats now just before this
[48:30] scripture we we've got this character
[48:32] John and John he he was to introduce the
[48:35] Messiah he was the messenger that was
[48:37] going to introduce the Messiah who was
[48:39] the the the face the one that was um
[48:41] crying in the wilderness prepare you the
[48:43] way of the Lord that's right okay so we
[48:45] know that we know that's in Malachi 3
[48:48] but now here John just before this to
[48:51] give some background John is in a he's
[48:53] in a place where he asked Jesus a
[48:56] question and he says in in Matthew 11
[48:59] and the first vers and it came to pass
[49:01] when Jesus made the end of um commanding
[49:04] his 12 disciples he departed then to
[49:07] teach and to preach in the cities now
[49:10] when John had heard in the prison The
[49:12] Works of Christ he sent two disciples
[49:15] and he said unto him art thou that
[49:17] should come he that should come or do we
[49:20] look for
[49:21] another but I want to I want to bring
[49:23] some context here so remember John
[49:25] introduced the Messiah John baptized the
[49:28] Lord Jesus Christ so if we go there all
[49:31] take your Bibles so but it's a bit of
[49:32] reading John um
[49:40] 129 and and as Jesus is now coming there
[49:44] to be to be baptized he walks to John
[49:48] but John sees
[49:50] him and he says the next day if
[49:53] everybody is there the next day John see
[49:56] of Jesus coming unto him and he say
[49:58] Behold the Lamb of God we take away the
[50:00] sin of the world this is he who I said
[50:03] will come after me a man which I
[50:06] preferred before me for he was before me
[50:11] so John Bears record that Jesus is Jesus
[50:14] yeah but now he's sitting in prison a
[50:17] Believer and he's doubting because he
[50:20] sends a messenger and he says is said
[50:22] him or do we look for another so he
[50:24] somewhere Supernatural things happen and
[50:27] with the disciples and everyone but now
[50:29] all of a sudden he doubts he's sitting
[50:31] in prison the circumstances started
[50:33] dictating the way he believes his
[50:36] circumstances around him in the place
[50:38] where he finds himself is starting now
[50:40] to dictate what he believes yeah I hope
[50:44] you can follow us think about this his
[50:47] place where he's sinting is now
[50:50] influencing his faith all right where
[50:53] are we sitting the most wretched blind
[50:56] miserable age there is we're sitting
[50:59] right in the middle of it but what is
[51:01] happening God is making a way God is
[51:04] making a
[51:06] way so let's go on then we go to Matthew
[51:11] 313 while we're
[51:14] there and this is still John so John is
[51:16] just he's he's real confused that
[51:19] doesn't mean he's not a believer that
[51:21] doesn't mean he's not saved that doesn't
[51:24] mean he doesn't know who Jesus is he's
[51:27] just in the place where he's he's not in
[51:29] the right State and he's been dictated
[51:32] by his circumstance now that little box
[51:34] that brother Bly spoke
[51:36] about and I don't know why the Lord sent
[51:38] me to say this this morning cuz this
[51:39] just came in this morning but here we go
[51:42] so Matthew 3 and: 13 the baptism of the
[51:45] beloved Son it says then cometh Jesus
[51:48] from G Galilee to the Jordan unto John
[51:52] to be baptized of him but John forbid
[51:54] him saying I in need to be baptized of
[51:56] thee and cometh thou to me and Jesus
[52:00] answered to him say suffer it to be so
[52:02] now for this is um for thus it becometh
[52:06] us to fulfill all righteousness and then
[52:09] he suffered him so Jesus comes to John
[52:12] and says John don't worry you have to
[52:14] wash the lamb you you have to prepare me
[52:17] yeah so so this all happens and then
[52:20] when we get to Matthew 11 John starts
[52:24] doubting because of his
[52:26] circumstance now see there's a
[52:28] three-part being that we are we Body
[52:30] Spirit Soul who knows that that's right
[52:33] okay so children your body has five
[52:35] senses hands up what are they we'll go
[52:38] one one at a time Liam we've got taste
[52:42] do you know feel feel s
[52:45] sight
[52:48] smell and hearing so these five senses
[52:52] helps us in what
[52:54] realm
[52:55] which one natural natural realm the
[52:58] coral realm this one so when somebody
[53:00] throws you with a ball you dodge it hey
[53:02] when you walk into your Mom's Kitchen
[53:03] you smell the food you're like I'm
[53:05] hungry you you've been hungry since
[53:07] since the morning but when you smell
[53:08] that food you're really hungry okay when
[53:11] your dad goes o you can hear it okay so
[53:14] those things help us they they help us
[53:16] in this realm but it's the only place
[53:17] where they really help us they have
[53:19] nothing to do with God's
[53:22] realm okay they have nothing to they are
[53:24] just made you human you've got that you
[53:26] need that to survive okay now we've got
[53:31] a spirit realm who knows about that
[53:33] there's some senses in there I wonder if
[53:35] we can pick up some senses there there's
[53:37] five senses that we we know which one is
[53:39] one
[53:40] AB Faith no not that
[53:44] one we've got
[53:46] conscience reasoning memory imin
[53:51] imagination and
[53:53] affection so those are the the things
[53:55] that help us get along so that's the one
[53:57] where your dad shouts at you he doesn't
[53:59] strangle you at the same time okay
[54:02] because you look at it and go oh maybe
[54:05] it's the first time they do it the
[54:06] reasoning comes in I shouldn't be so
[54:08] hard affection takes over he remembers
[54:10] all the good things that you do so those
[54:12] things are just to help us gel to get
[54:15] along amen without them we will be in a
[54:18] very bad place okay so this is just the
[54:20] basis I'm not preaching yet this is just
[54:22] me relaxing give me a chance it's it's
[54:25] dating looking at all of you looking at
[54:27] me trust
[54:29] me tough crowd um but there's another
[54:34] part of you it's your soul now AB say
[54:37] again what is in your soul what was that
[54:38] word you used Faith what else is in the
[54:42] soul is the control tower of
[54:46] man love that that's that's all
[54:49] attributes of it but Revelation comes
[54:52] into the soul that's good the holy the
[54:55] Holy Ghost is in your soul the
[54:57] predestinated seed of God is in your
[55:00] soul so that's something you have no
[55:03] control over but you have control over
[55:05] I'll tell you why if God made you a man
[55:10] I'm going to address it while we're here
[55:12] guess what you are you're a man as much
[55:15] as you deny it as much as you think
[55:18] you're a lamp post or a door bell or
[55:21] whatever you want to be God made you a
[55:23] man that's what you are and when he gave
[55:26] you a soul and he put his predestinated
[55:28] seed within you you have it you can deny
[55:31] it as much as you like God put it there
[55:34] God will see it into the end because we
[55:36] forget how big God really is we think
[55:40] that if I have a rough time here on
[55:42] Earth and things don't always go my way
[55:44] all of a sudden I lose my salvation all
[55:47] of a sudden I'm I I'm in in band with
[55:49] the devil and and now I'm a a a renegade
[55:52] and no no the soul belongs to God you're
[55:56] the keeper your body and your senses all
[55:59] is the keeper of that Soul so what you
[56:01] let in is what's going to come out but
[56:03] the soul belongs to him or it belongs to
[56:05] Satan there's only two
[56:07] seeds so you identify with who you want
[56:10] to today we've got three Believers we're
[56:14] going to take a little bit of a subject
[56:16] one was saved by
[56:17] grace unmerited Grace one wanted a way
[56:22] out and one wanted a way
[56:27] in and they're all sitting right in our
[56:29] church
[56:31] today brother Bean can't say it but I
[56:35] can and they're all
[56:37] believers they all believe in God the
[56:40] devil's believe in God they fear and
[56:42] tremble they all believe in God but one
[56:45] wants a way out one wants a way in and
[56:48] one just found
[56:50] Grace he didn't even know what he wanted
[56:53] but he found Grace so let's jump into it
[56:55] before we get in there goes Psalm 91 so
[56:58] we just get a little bit of a a a
[57:02] softer a softer feel to
[57:05] this amen help me
[57:09] Lord so there's this secret place that
[57:12] the Lord has for us my my title for the
[57:14] sermon today is place of rest there's a
[57:16] secret place where you can hide so make
[57:19] this just you there's a secret place
[57:21] where thoughts can leave you there's a
[57:24] secret place where Clarity can come back
[57:26] into your mind there's a secret place
[57:28] where you can commune with God so as
[57:31] same disclaimer Brother Andy said if I
[57:33] look at you I don't mean you I just look
[57:35] at you because you're in front of me and
[57:37] I can't preach that way it will look bit
[57:39] wrong so if I look at you just a point
[57:41] of reference don't take anything like
[57:43] that you speak to God but see there's a
[57:46] secret place and the secret place there
[57:49] is for you and
[57:51] God your mind can't go there
[57:55] I want to explain to you your mind don't
[57:57] go there your thoughts don't go there
[58:00] nothing goes but the presence of you and
[58:03] God because sometimes you will
[58:05] experience the presence of God not even
[58:07] feeling nothing you'll be sitting in
[58:09] your room and you'll just be thinking
[58:10] nothing and the Lord comes down and if
[58:12] he's never done it for you he will
[58:15] because God is always around you you
[58:19] just looking with the wrong
[58:21] eyes okay so your your head knowledge
[58:25] makes you stubborn your head knowledge
[58:27] puts you away from God your head
[58:29] knowledge is where the battle is and so
[58:32] many the theologians and so many um um
[58:35] pastors and all those things get it so
[58:37] mixed up because they try to understand
[58:39] God here but the control tower is
[58:43] here and the secret place is in
[58:46] Christ so here's the end of the sermon
[58:49] so more quickly there's only one place
[58:51] you need to
[58:52] be in Christ that's Amen in the message
[58:58] uh-uh message introduces you to
[59:01] Christ where should you be in Christ if
[59:06] you don't find yourself in Christ then I
[59:10] pray today that you would ask the Lord
[59:11] to bring you into Christ to baptize you
[59:15] with his holy spirit so that you may
[59:17] receive it and that you might get rest
[59:19] for your
[59:20] soul because that rest is something when
[59:23] all the waves are shaking
[59:25] it ain't moving
[59:26] you Psalm 91 he says he that dwelleth in
[59:30] the sacred Place secret place of the
[59:31] most high shall abide under the shadow
[59:33] of the
[59:35] almighty amen and he said of and he say
[59:38] of the Lord he is my refuge and my
[59:40] Fortress my God in him will I trust
[59:43] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[59:45] Snare of the Fowler and from the nois
[59:47] and pestilence he shall cover thee with
[59:49] his feathers and under his wings shall
[59:52] thou
[59:53] thrust he truth shall be thy shield and
[59:56] thy buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for
[59:59] the terror by night or for the arrow
[1:00:01] that Firth by
[1:00:03] day fear is a
[1:00:05] liar nor the pestilence that walketh in
[1:00:08] the darkness nor the destruction that
[1:00:11] wasteth at noon
[1:00:13] day a thousand will fall by thy side and
[1:00:16] 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall
[1:00:19] not come nigh thee so God very boldly
[1:00:23] says you you don't need to
[1:00:27] worry I got this you you ladyo and
[1:00:30] dwellers that that that walk in this age
[1:00:33] is so wretched don't worry you're
[1:00:36] supposed to be different I I got you
[1:00:39] I've made a promise here I could keep
[1:00:41] David I can keep you you know it doesn't
[1:00:44] matter and and then this is going to go
[1:00:46] into what I'm going to do now but let's
[1:00:47] go on he says Only With Thine Eyes shall
[1:00:52] thou behold and see the reward of the
[1:00:54] wicked
[1:00:55] because thou H has made the Lord which
[1:00:57] is thy Refuge even the most high thy
[1:01:02] habitation there was a conscious
[1:01:04] decision made by your soul on your
[1:01:07] behalf that is going to start talking to
[1:01:09] you is called this thing called
[1:01:11] conscience and every time when you get
[1:01:13] something wrong or you starting to do
[1:01:15] something that is not in the will of God
[1:01:16] it says
[1:01:20] why you
[1:01:22] know you know you know I had a dog okay
[1:01:27] his name was Macky we called him AA cuz
[1:01:29] he was man he could operate I'm going to
[1:01:31] read the last leave that up the moment
[1:01:34] my dad walked into the gate he knew the
[1:01:37] dog did something wrong cuz the dog's
[1:01:39] ears will be flat and his tail will be
[1:01:41] between his legs and he'll be like oh
[1:01:43] dear oh dear I hope he doesn't see me so
[1:01:45] my dad don't know what he's done but he
[1:01:47] knows he's done something now dad's I
[1:01:50] don't know if you but have you ever
[1:01:51] walked into your house and you see your
[1:01:52] son's face and you're like what have you
[1:01:55] done it's like what I didn't do anything
[1:01:59] the fact that you react like that is
[1:02:01] what have you done it will come out the
[1:02:04] truth will always come out but you're
[1:02:05] like I know you he knows you and that's
[1:02:09] why he gave you that that beautiful
[1:02:11] predestinated seed within you as as
[1:02:13] small as it can be that little voice
[1:02:16] goes oi don't do this and the battle is
[1:02:20] on because now for the next 5 seconds
[1:02:22] before you either be awesome or you be
[1:02:25] in trouble that is your choice but it's
[1:02:28] your
[1:02:29] choice you have to make
[1:02:32] it but he says make me your habitation
[1:02:36] and he says and there shall no evil
[1:02:38] before thee neither shall a play come
[1:02:40] nigh thy dwelling so if you can put your
[1:02:44] whole heart in Jesus Christ if you can
[1:02:47] make your day start with the Lord Jesus
[1:02:49] Christ if you start it off right on a
[1:02:52] good step the rest of your day no EV
[1:02:54] evil shall be thee and didn't say it
[1:02:56] will come and tempt you it says it won't
[1:02:58] be thee it won't overtake you because
[1:03:01] Isaac saying it today as well we're
[1:03:03] Overcomers so evil will come but evil
[1:03:06] will leave fear will come but fear will
[1:03:09] leave but the thing is he give you
[1:03:11] enough to get against that but you have
[1:03:14] to start your day in his habitation
[1:03:16] within the Holy
[1:03:18] Spirit seen seen young people start
[1:03:21] their day with Twitter and WhatsApp and
[1:03:23] and every status update they can
[1:03:26] do
[1:03:28] why why why not start it with reading
[1:03:31] your
[1:03:32] Bible I didn't say read the whole Bible
[1:03:36] I said just start by reading scripture
[1:03:38] and then start thinking about that it's
[1:03:41] Sunday I feel I can preach really long
[1:03:44] today
[1:03:46] amen I I do feel I do feel like if you
[1:03:49] can start your day with God okay how can
[1:03:52] you fail amen
[1:03:56] if you go in the morning I wake up and
[1:03:58] then I roll out a bed like this cuz you
[1:04:00] know when you and I put my feet down on
[1:04:03] the ground and I sit on my bed and I
[1:04:04] raise my hands like this and I go I said
[1:04:07] bless the Lord oh my soul glory to to
[1:04:11] you unto you Lord Jesus Lord I love you
[1:04:14] it's all I say I love you so much then I
[1:04:17] wake up and I walk and I going to do my
[1:04:18] Bible study brush my teeth do all those
[1:04:20] things but my very first thought that
[1:04:23] when I wake up is Lord I am not worthy
[1:04:27] but you made me worthy my very first
[1:04:29] thought is Lord today I love you for my
[1:04:32] children yes my Lord see if we create
[1:04:34] that atmosphere around us how can we
[1:04:37] fail when you walk in this world because
[1:04:40] your foundation already is on the
[1:04:43] Rock but you wake up and you wonder I
[1:04:45] wonder what post I missed and I wonder
[1:04:48] what this sister is saying and O does
[1:04:50] somebody like my Instagram and you're
[1:04:52] already on the wrong foot you will not
[1:04:55] survive the day you can't because you
[1:04:58] started it
[1:04:59] wrong sorry is what it
[1:05:02] is so let's jump into it go to Mark
[1:05:06] chapter 10 now we go into our three
[1:05:08] subjects awesome testimonies in this
[1:05:11] word remember this is not stories I'll
[1:05:13] always say this this is for Real Life
[1:05:15] testimonies this is people like you and
[1:05:17] me that had a promise and God just
[1:05:20] fulfilled the promise in them the reason
[1:05:22] you think it's a story
[1:05:24] is because you think you're living in a
[1:05:27] fairy
[1:05:27] tale and you know what God will shake
[1:05:30] heavens and earth but he will get you
[1:05:31] out of your fairy tale because we re
[1:05:34] live in a real world with a real enemy
[1:05:37] and a real God Amen don't ever think the
[1:05:40] story this is a story this is a
[1:05:42] testimony your name is written in this
[1:05:45] word and every testimony David's life
[1:05:48] the three Believers Cedric M and abedo
[1:05:51] Daniel all the prophets of all somewhere
[1:05:53] in your in your walk with the Lord you
[1:05:55] will identify with one of those events
[1:05:59] because that's why God says nothing on
[1:06:00] this Earth is new nothing nothing Under
[1:06:03] the Sun is new nothing is a surprise to
[1:06:05] God okay amen amen so we go there to
[1:06:09] Mark
[1:06:11] 10 I love the Lord
[1:06:14] amen okay here we go let's go to Mark 10
[1:06:17] this this
[1:06:20] guy he he haded
[1:06:23] um
[1:06:25] and we go there to
[1:06:27] verse
[1:06:29] 17 amen this is the man I decided to
[1:06:34] start with the one that wa wanted a way
[1:06:38] out okay let's read Because I'll preach
[1:06:40] around the
[1:06:42] reading and when Jesus gone forth into
[1:06:45] the way there came one running and
[1:06:48] kneeled to him and asked him good Master
[1:06:51] what shall I do that I'll inherit
[1:06:52] eternal life so I want you to see he
[1:06:56] kneeled okay he worshiped the Lord you
[1:07:00] don't bow your your your knee to someone
[1:07:03] just because remember brother brandom
[1:07:05] said he says I only bow to one man to
[1:07:07] God so this this believer comes to the
[1:07:11] Lord Jesus and very sincerely he kneels
[1:07:15] and he says good
[1:07:16] Master good Master what shall I do to
[1:07:19] inherit eternal life very sincere good
[1:07:22] question okay and Jesus said to him why
[1:07:26] callest thou me
[1:07:28] good there is none good but that is
[1:07:32] God he says Thou knowest the
[1:07:34] Commandments do them not uh don't do not
[1:07:37] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[1:07:39] do not be false witness defraud not
[1:07:41] honor thy father and thy
[1:07:46] mother amen thank you I was just waiting
[1:07:49] for honor thy father and thy mother cuz
[1:07:52] it's got a promise attach to
[1:07:54] it and he answered and said to him
[1:07:57] master I have observed all these from my
[1:08:00] youth I'm in the
[1:08:03] message hey come on yeah come on bring
[1:08:06] it home I'm in the message I know the
[1:08:09] Seven Seals I know they were all
[1:08:10] revealed to me I know what Revelation is
[1:08:13] I know the mystery of Christ reveal I
[1:08:16] know where I'm standing in the lady of
[1:08:17] cnh I know I know I know I'm happy I
[1:08:22] come to church my mom drags me here and
[1:08:24] my dad drags me but I'm here I'm a
[1:08:30] Believer the moment the song first song
[1:08:32] sing I start falling
[1:08:34] asleep the moment the preaching starts
[1:08:37] going I try to think about everything
[1:08:38] else but that I'm I'm a Believer I don't
[1:08:41] steal
[1:08:43] ish I don't lie sometimes come on this
[1:08:48] is a Believer he goes to Jesus and he
[1:08:50] says to him I've not done any of this
[1:08:52] and Jesus testifies he says yep that's
[1:08:53] that's right you haven't done any of
[1:08:55] this we read on he says then says Jesus
[1:08:58] beholding him he loved him and he said
[1:09:01] unto him one thing thou lackest go thy
[1:09:04] way sell whatever thou Hast give it to
[1:09:07] the
[1:09:08] poor then thou shall have treasure in
[1:09:10] heaven and come to me take up your cross
[1:09:12] and follow me but there's one thing I
[1:09:15] want you to do just let that go cuz you
[1:09:19] still want to do it in your own ability
[1:09:21] yes so see this guy wanted way out
[1:09:25] because if he couldn't keep the law in
[1:09:27] his own ability if he couldn't make it
[1:09:29] into Heaven by his own ability the way
[1:09:31] so this is this is what people do
[1:09:33] denominational Christians and I and I'll
[1:09:35] say it in a in a nicest way they cut God
[1:09:38] to fit their
[1:09:40] life they don't they don't get cut to
[1:09:42] fit God's
[1:09:44] life they want God as a Leisure they
[1:09:47] want God when they need him they want
[1:09:49] God when they sick they want God when
[1:09:51] other people are sick they want to name
[1:09:53] use the name of Jesus they want to use
[1:09:55] it all over the show but they don't want
[1:09:57] to take his name in baptism they want to
[1:10:00] speak the name of Jesus they want to use
[1:10:01] the name of Jesus they want to profess
[1:10:03] the name of Jesus but I still want to
[1:10:05] wear what I want to wear I still want to
[1:10:07] cut what I want to cut because the thing
[1:10:09] is the motive in their heart is I don't
[1:10:11] want to be like him I want him to fit
[1:10:15] me but that's wrong yes Lord that is
[1:10:19] that is absolutely wrong and I say it
[1:10:21] with everything in me it is abomination
[1:10:24] in the sight of God because God has
[1:10:27] mercy and he has great but he comes this
[1:10:30] guy's way and he sees to that re Young
[1:10:32] Ruler I know where your heart is your
[1:10:35] heart is not keeping my law your heart
[1:10:38] is not having a relationship with me
[1:10:40] your heart is having me fit your
[1:10:43] lifestyle so why don't you get rid of
[1:10:45] your lifestyle and follow me why don't
[1:10:49] you give up what you want and fit my
[1:10:52] profile and see how old will bless you
[1:10:55] and what does he
[1:10:56] do go on next
[1:10:59] verse say say and he was sad in that
[1:11:02] saying and he went away grieved for he
[1:11:05] had many
[1:11:06] possessions so we were still looking at
[1:11:08] his way not God what can I do for you
[1:11:11] and I will surrender everything to be in
[1:11:14] your
[1:11:16] presence God you fit my
[1:11:21] way he's a believer
[1:11:24] I know it's strong brother Ben maybe
[1:11:26] can't say these things because he's a
[1:11:29] pastor and he loves all of you very very
[1:11:31] much but brother brandham said the
[1:11:33] ministers Don't Preach these things
[1:11:35] anymore and the people are falling away
[1:11:38] because they're being lied
[1:11:41] to God don't fit your
[1:11:44] lifestyle he didn't call you to be a
[1:11:46] lady oia and walk lady oia with you he
[1:11:49] called you to get out of the
[1:11:52] place
[1:11:54] you stay in your tradition you will stay
[1:11:57] here you will not go in a
[1:11:59] Rapture that is the honest truth let no
[1:12:02] man lie to you amen hallelujah God is
[1:12:05] looking for a
[1:12:06] bride he's looking for someone that can
[1:12:09] surrender
[1:12:10] everything it's hard but once you've
[1:12:14] done it you're in that secret place once
[1:12:17] you've done it he lifts you up into a
[1:12:19] place where even if all these questions
[1:12:21] and things and murmurings happen you
[1:12:22] just go
[1:12:24] because it's anchored within you there
[1:12:26] is more than just rules and regulations
[1:12:29] the Lord if you're still looking in
[1:12:31] rules and regulations you're still in
[1:12:33] the body State you're still in the
[1:12:35] carnal mind it says to be spiritually
[1:12:37] minded is life to be Carly minded is
[1:12:40] death so if you realing in the carnal
[1:12:42] mind and you're fighting a carnal battle
[1:12:44] you're going to stay on a carnal Earth
[1:12:51] amen but Jesus loved him
[1:12:54] Jesus looked at him and he saw his heart
[1:12:57] was really a good heart but he knew
[1:12:59] there was something he could not let
[1:13:03] go but he's coming your way he says can
[1:13:05] you let that go
[1:13:08] today or are you looking for a way
[1:13:14] out Hallelujah okay let's go to the next
[1:13:18] one Mark 5 stay in The Book of
[1:13:22] Mark we don't fit God our way I Tred to
[1:13:27] I try to make God fit my way I try to
[1:13:30] make God make
[1:13:32] sense don't make sense God don't make
[1:13:36] sense to the carnal mind he's so
[1:13:38] Supernatural that he will he'll Bowl you
[1:13:41] over every time Hallelujah because he
[1:13:43] doesn't deal with a carinal mind he
[1:13:45] deals with a soul the soul belongs to
[1:13:48] him the soul is where he ministers to
[1:13:51] the carnal mind is the battle place
[1:13:53] that's fine the soul is where he comes
[1:13:56] to and he's put something in all of you
[1:13:58] you're Believers that's why you're here
[1:14:00] no matter what the devil say it's like
[1:14:01] all brother and M's just fighting with
[1:14:03] me now just take it back to God and say
[1:14:05] Lord is that me is that me and if it's
[1:14:09] me take it out amen take it out I don't
[1:14:13] want nothing to do with it Hallelujah I
[1:14:15] don't care if they see rules let me see
[1:14:17] you amen because when I was and here's
[1:14:20] my testimony when I was in the world and
[1:14:22] I had one question to ask God one
[1:14:25] question one why should I wear long
[1:14:29] pants one I had I had everything I can
[1:14:33] cut my hair I don't mind I can I'm a man
[1:14:35] I can do I can but why I grew up in
[1:14:38] these
[1:14:39] things I was happy I grew up in a
[1:14:43] country which is hot I grew up in a
[1:14:45] country
[1:14:46] when who has been in South Africa raise
[1:14:49] your hand you guys get 23° and you start
[1:14:52] sweating we're like 40° no wind blowing
[1:14:55] sun beaming
[1:14:57] down now I come into this country it's
[1:15:00] called I'm playing Cricket with a jersey
[1:15:01] on people look at me like you're crazy
[1:15:04] it's a warm sunny day the wind's not
[1:15:07] even blowing I go to bed with a full
[1:15:09] Blazer on and they're like what are you
[1:15:11] doing I'm like I'm getting
[1:15:13] cold but my reasoning was I want God to
[1:15:18] fit my pattern because I grew up this
[1:15:20] way that's my culture that's how we
[1:15:22] always done it I'm I still believe you
[1:15:24] God I can still see you work I can still
[1:15:26] see you do but God says no I want you to
[1:15:28] to change that for me are you willing so
[1:15:32] I don't go to brother Ben straight away
[1:15:34] stomp on his door open up say brother
[1:15:36] Ben you better tell me why I shouldn't
[1:15:38] wear shorts and if you can't convince me
[1:15:40] I won't do it cuz my pastor in South
[1:15:42] Africa said that's wrong this guy Noah I
[1:15:46] stopped right there the word struck me
[1:15:49] it says how much of your nakedness do
[1:15:50] you want to reveal that's what the word
[1:15:52] says when they built the steps of
[1:15:54] Ascension they said they build it in
[1:15:56] such a way that when the priest walked
[1:15:57] up there they couldn't see their
[1:15:59] nakedness their undergarments wow so I
[1:16:02] said Lord that's a good scripture I said
[1:16:05] but can you reveal that to me because as
[1:16:08] much as it's written in this word if you
[1:16:10] don't reveal it to me I cannot change it
[1:16:13] because it's still then just me and it's
[1:16:15] not you that was my
[1:16:18] prayer and I went one day with brother
[1:16:20] Edan and we were on the beach and
[1:16:22] because was a make believer back then I
[1:16:26] uh and I'll say it was honest opinion
[1:16:28] cuz I was reserved I still held back I
[1:16:31] didn't sell out so I had my shorts on
[1:16:35] and then I had my tracksuit over it so
[1:16:37] we're going to go swim so Here Comes The
[1:16:40] Showdown we get to the beach I park my
[1:16:43] youth there and Ed Parks his and he
[1:16:46] jumps out and he says we're swimming and
[1:16:48] I'm like we're
[1:16:49] swimming but now God's going to say what
[1:16:52] are you going to do with it this so I
[1:16:54] said cool first one in let's go I strip
[1:16:57] off my clothes and I feel completely
[1:16:59] naked I still have my shorts on but I
[1:17:02] feel naked like nothing so I ran into
[1:17:08] the ocean as fast as I can because what
[1:17:10] all of a sudden God revealed something
[1:17:12] to me he didn't reveal how I saw myself
[1:17:15] he revealed to me how he saw me so I run
[1:17:19] into the ocean and now I'm swimming in
[1:17:20] the ocean I get like this deep because I
[1:17:22] don't to reveal anything to no one now
[1:17:25] my conscience is starting to talk to me
[1:17:28] now my conscience is saying remember you
[1:17:29] asked him that question now inside the
[1:17:32] heart the control tower takes over now
[1:17:34] now he's starting to deal with me but
[1:17:37] now I don't refuse him I sit in that
[1:17:40] water I pray Ed is swimming he's like a
[1:17:42] polar bear he's just going water's ice
[1:17:44] cold I'm just sitting in there and I'm
[1:17:47] sweating as much as I am in that water
[1:17:49] because now the battle became in aran's
[1:17:52] foreground and I said Lord please reveal
[1:17:55] this to me and I looked around me and
[1:17:57] the water was murky and I felt unsafe

[1:20:06] you shouldn't eat you seek what you
[1:20:09] shouldn't seek it will find you
[1:20:11] temptation is out there looking for you

[1:20:17] yourself to it you will take a demon
[1:20:20] amen people you don't believe in demons
[1:20:22] have you ever seen someone cast out a
[1:20:25] demon have you ever seen it if you

[1:20:32] I had my son 5 years old tell me there's
[1:20:34] a spirit behind me that just walked out
[1:20:36] the door Satan just walked out the door
[1:20:38] what does he know about it he was sick
[1:20:42] we prayed over him and the next day he
[1:20:43] tells me we're sitting at the table and
[1:20:45] he looks behind me goes dad there's a
[1:20:46] black Spirit behind you there's like a
[1:20:48] back Shadow behind you and it's walking
[1:20:49] out the door and I'm
[1:20:51] like
[1:20:54] I said
[1:20:56] okay tell me what you see cuz now I want
[1:20:58] to see if you made it up or not he goes
[1:21:00] no it was a shadow of the man no eyes
[1:21:02] just a shadow looked like a man it just
[1:21:04] appeared there but it it went out the
[1:21:07] door is it that Satan that
[1:21:10] left I said okay Lord when Chantel was
[1:21:14] in in South Africa in the house ran
[1:21:17] would be 3 years old hey three four
[1:21:18] years old 3 years old he'll look past
[1:21:21] his mom he'll go mom there's a man
[1:21:23] standing at the door she looks around no
[1:21:26] one at the
[1:21:27] door what's that there's everybody
[1:21:31] believes in ghosts everybody can see the
[1:21:32] manifestation of devils and demons and
[1:21:35] and all tattooed bodies and piercings
[1:21:37] and all these things happen to people
[1:21:39] but when you preach it they don't
[1:21:40] believe it when you say you're taking a
[1:21:42] devil because you're opening yourself up
[1:21:44] for it they don't believe that but they
[1:21:46] can see a manifest all over the show but
[1:21:48] they don't believe it can hit them
[1:21:50] because I'm a believer I'm a churchgoing
[1:21:51] message believer can't touch me can't
[1:21:54] touch me can't touch
[1:21:56] me no no attention span of a goldfish if
[1:22:00] it's more than 30 seconds yep no no it's
[1:22:03] not
[1:22:04] entertainment what are you led by
[1:22:08] yeah demon
[1:22:10] Spirits now before we read that cuz this
[1:22:14] ties in with this least you might like
[1:22:21] me
[1:22:24] this is God's picture of all of
[1:22:28] you before time began Le you got four
[1:22:32] children eh correct 1 2 3 5 did we do it
[1:22:36] right 1 2 3 4 5 yep you got it Jay
[1:22:40] you're the taller
[1:22:41] one sorry Davey it's true okay so
[1:22:45] there's his
[1:22:46] children now sin comes cuz remember
[1:22:49] they've got a testimony in our
[1:22:51] church of Davey Davey you're the shorter
[1:22:54] one
[1:22:56] okay so sin
[1:22:59] comes and it cuts Mr Davy away from the
[1:23:02] Lee family now the reason the parents
[1:23:04] aren't there is they're the one of the
[1:23:07] family at the back so you're all not
[1:23:08] jealous
[1:23:09] okay so they cut out Mr Davey Davey gets
[1:23:15] all full of himself takes a couple of
[1:23:18] demon Spirits drinks way too many V
[1:23:20] energy
[1:23:21] drinks and all of a
[1:23:23] sudden just gets casted there he is on
[1:23:27] the
[1:23:28] floor now the Lee family looks
[1:23:35] empty but that's not all so one of the
[1:23:38] other brothers and sisters here from
[1:23:39] church they they kind of believe hey you
[1:23:43] know what I might leave as well because
[1:23:46] if David leaves and he drinks all the V
[1:23:49] he
[1:23:50] can then maybe I want to bit of Freedom
[1:23:53] too I'm going to go
[1:23:55] too and I do this and this just bear
[1:23:58] with me that's why I failed um playing
[1:24:01] with clay in
[1:24:03] school I always ate
[1:24:06] it never really played with
[1:24:11] it
[1:24:13] it salty hey so another brother decides
[1:24:17] hey it's not good enough for Davey
[1:24:18] because I'm looking at him I'm not
[1:24:20] looking at him go too there he goes
[1:24:25] sister goes oo I like cutting my hair
[1:24:28] and I like wearing pants and I like why
[1:24:30] doing all these things and this message
[1:24:33] just boring I don't want to look like
[1:24:35] that one so I'm going to
[1:24:37] rebel and I'm going
[1:24:40] to I hope this eats
[1:24:43] home this is God not the Le family the
[1:24:46] shirt just had Lee on it and it was the
[1:24:49] only shirt that that I had since the
[1:24:50] Lees gave it to me I think you guys did
[1:24:52] give it to us wasn't it now did you buy
[1:24:54] it man you guys got trademark
[1:24:58] hey thank you I hope they're paying you
[1:25:01] royalties he that's a beautiful name God
[1:25:04] bless the Lee family so this
[1:25:07] sister she just goes now remember this I
[1:25:10] was going to preach it anyways I had my
[1:25:12] wife do this shirt for me so the artist
[1:25:15] is definitely Shantel not me or else you
[1:25:18] would have had a bunch of stick men and
[1:25:20] they all look exactly the same on no
[1:25:22] they won't cuz I don't have consistency
[1:25:24] in my drawing but yeah now we
[1:25:27] go gone she's gone
[1:25:30] too now we as the church we stay
[1:25:34] behind and here is all the ones that
[1:25:38] left and it leaves
[1:25:40] holes who wants to try this on David
[1:25:42] come cuz you're you're a Lee put on this
[1:25:44] shirt over your shirt and just wear it
[1:25:48] for me for a while would show everyone
[1:25:50] how it looks
[1:25:53] now
[1:25:55] remember turn around look a bit patchy
[1:25:59] hey just keep it on for now please
[1:26:02] they're not
[1:26:03] lost they're not
[1:26:05] lost they cut from the same
[1:26:08] shirt they've got the Holy Ghost within
[1:26:10] them they're just rebellious they're not
[1:26:14] listening so they go by the wayside so
[1:26:18] God will deal with them one will find
[1:26:21] Grace one will find a way out or try to
[1:26:26] and one will find a way back keep that
[1:26:29] in mind amen a man with an unclean
[1:26:31] spirit and it came to the other side of
[1:26:34] the sea into a country of the the um
[1:26:38] Gans and when they was out of the ship
[1:26:41] immediately they met a man out of the
[1:26:43] tombs and a man with an unclean
[1:26:47] Spirit who had his dwelling among the
[1:26:49] tombs now let me tell you this isn't it
[1:26:52] strange Satan always finds himself in
[1:26:55] dead beats dead places where there's no
[1:27:01] life no life in tombs in places where
[1:27:05] there's no God where it's all evil and
[1:27:08] bad he he dwells there and he wants to
[1:27:11] take you there cuz he can't dwell where
[1:27:14] there's life he can't dwell where the
[1:27:16] water is running now he has to isolate
[1:27:19] you and remove you from life M he has to
[1:27:23] cut you out and toss you to the dogs
[1:27:27] that's how he works that's the only way
[1:27:29] he works he wants to make sure that you
[1:27:31] are different than the
[1:27:34] Believers and he wants to trick your
[1:27:36] mind to make you believe that you are
[1:27:39] different let's go
[1:27:42] on his dwelling who was found among the
[1:27:44] tombs and no man could bind him not with
[1:27:48] chains so this this demon that's upon
[1:27:51] this this Legion of demons that's upon
[1:27:54] this brother is strong demons are strong
[1:27:57] you think you can take down a demon in
[1:27:59] your own ability don't do that you are
[1:28:01] on very dangerous ground those demons
[1:28:04] are very strong but our God is
[1:28:07] stronger so don't don't forget your
[1:28:09] enemy The Devil he's like a roaring lion
[1:28:11] but he ain't the lion
[1:28:14] okay so now here look at this he says
[1:28:17] because you have been um often Bound in
[1:28:20] in fets and chains and the chain has
[1:28:22] been plucked aund by him and the fet is
[1:28:25] broken in pieces neither could any man
[1:28:27] tame
[1:28:28] him the more the brothers speak to the
[1:28:30] guy the more he goes off the rails the
[1:28:33] more the sisters pray for him the more
[1:28:34] he goes off the rails the more you say
[1:28:37] come back to church man there we miss
[1:28:39] you the further he runs
[1:28:42] away he's just stubborn he's possessed
[1:28:45] with Devils he's opened his heart to
[1:28:47] devils and they sting on him and they
[1:28:49] manifesting and as much as the people
[1:28:51] love him and want to bring him back to
[1:28:53] God he's
[1:28:55] running he's just running but see he
[1:28:59] came to a moment where he saw something
[1:29:01] he saw
[1:29:02] someone that was
[1:29:04] different because his view came off the
[1:29:07] world his view came off his
[1:29:10] situation and here he goes he says and
[1:29:12] all and day at night he was in the
[1:29:14] mountains and in the tombs crying
[1:29:16] cutting himself with stones tormented by
[1:29:19] all these Dem demons
[1:29:23] and always night and day it was in the
[1:29:25] mountains where he tombs caring cutting
[1:29:26] himself but when he saw Jesus AAR off he
[1:29:30] ran and worshiped him yeah even the
[1:29:33] Devils worship our lord
[1:29:35] Jesus all that is breath all that is in
[1:29:39] heaven and earth and under the Earth
[1:29:40] shall worship Him amen shall testify
[1:29:44] because he's God Almighty and he falls
[1:29:46] to his feet and says and he cried with a
[1:29:49] loud
[1:29:50] voice and um as he have do what have we
[1:29:54] to do with thee Jesus thou son of the
[1:29:56] most high God I Adar thee by God that
[1:29:59] thou tormented me
[1:30:02] not wow this devil all of a sudden was
[1:30:04] so big Legion was so strong the Army
[1:30:07] couldn't bound him the men in the town
[1:30:09] couldn't handle him he was the mean Mac
[1:30:11] he was the Big Daddy he was so possessed
[1:30:14] with the spirit that when Brothers come
[1:30:16] he'll just push them away already he had
[1:30:19] a family brother Brandon picks this up
[1:30:21] he says this man had had a family this
[1:30:23] man was a dad but he took so many
[1:30:26] spirits and they possessed him that he
[1:30:28] left everything and he went and and went
[1:30:30] to a dead Place cut off from
[1:30:33] Life cut
[1:30:35] off by
[1:30:37] himself isn't it strange that when
[1:30:40] people leave this message they always
[1:30:41] want to be by
[1:30:46] themselves don't want a fellowship you
[1:30:48] call a youth meeting they ain't coming
[1:30:52] you say hey let's have a prayer night
[1:30:54] they don't want to
[1:30:56] come you say hey we all just going to go
[1:30:58] to the park and kick ball they're the
[1:30:59] last ones there but when you say hey
[1:31:01] we're going to go play some games and do
[1:31:03] some cards man they're all there cuz
[1:31:04] it's now fun but when there's something
[1:31:07] serious around the word there that demon
[1:31:09] Spirit don't want to go there it wants
[1:31:11] to sit in a dead place in a
[1:31:15] tomb what is possessing you can you
[1:31:19] identify may God make it real what is
[1:31:22] leading you today is it leading you
[1:31:25] towards God or is it leading you away
[1:31:27] from God where is your heart where's
[1:31:30] your affection see God has Grace for you
[1:31:33] I say it today God has Grace for youall
[1:31:36] he has Mercy he's put a seed in that
[1:31:39] Legion and he knew he was going to go
[1:31:41] get him he knew it and here comes Legion
[1:31:45] and he cried with a loud voice and he
[1:31:46] says what have I done with thee Jesus
[1:31:49] thou son of the most high I Deary by God
[1:31:51] to me me not for he said unto him come
[1:31:55] out of the man thou unclean Spirit

[1:32:00] AK-47 and start shooting the demons

[1:32:06] presence of God could change your

[1:35:41] went to Legion and the poor fellow was
[1:35:43] so out of his mind that the Devils
[1:35:46] worship Jesus Christ not even him hope
[1:35:48] you realize
[1:35:50] that Jesus cast out the Devils he says
[1:35:53] and he asked them what is thy name and
[1:35:56] they answered saying my name is Legion
[1:35:57] for we are many we watch YouTube and
[1:36:00] Twitter and and all this other stuff I
[1:36:04] don't even know it I'm so out of devices
[1:36:05] these days and when I didn't do that I
[1:36:07] was on the news and I just eat all that
[1:36:09] and then when somebody says that I eat
[1:36:11] all that and everything that I can take
[1:36:13] possibly I took in here not in here in
[1:36:17] here and now all of a sudden it's
[1:36:18] manifesting and now all of a sudden I'm
[1:36:20] doing things it's out of my character
[1:36:23] cuz I used to be a good church boy when
[1:36:24] my daddy and mommy still gave me a p but
[1:36:27] now all of a sudden now I'm bigger and
[1:36:29] more grown up and I can make my own
[1:36:30] choices now I just let Satan rule my
[1:36:34] members so I got many Devils
[1:36:38] many and they're tormenting him because
[1:36:40] remember it's nobody in their right mind
[1:36:43] want to be in this state have you ever
[1:36:45] been in a graveyard oh man come on it
[1:36:48] freaks me out if you put the lights down
[1:36:51] you you walk through a graveyard it's a
[1:36:53] icky place man it's like there could be
[1:36:56] dead people here well there is dead
[1:36:57] people there yeah but what if they wake
[1:36:59] up well they will wake up one day if
[1:37:01] they're Saints if they're dead and far
[1:37:03] removed from God they'll stay in that
[1:37:04] grave but see the thing is when I was
[1:37:07] still in the world under that influence
[1:37:09] you would not catch me in one of those
[1:37:10] places it's it's not a nice place to be
[1:37:13] you're not very comfortable there the
[1:37:15] gospel makes you very comfortable
[1:37:17] sometimes too comfortable but it's a
[1:37:19] good place to be because it is
[1:37:21] security against your enemy it's your
[1:37:24] Fortress okay we're g
[1:37:27] sorry and he besought him that he would
[1:37:30] not send them away out of a country now
[1:37:32] there was n unto them in the mountains a
[1:37:34] great herd of swine a great herd have
[1:37:37] you ever
[1:37:38] seen a lot of pigs the most I've ever
[1:37:42] seen is like four or five in a pig
[1:37:44] remember it with brother F that's pretty
[1:37:47] much the most Pig I'm going to tell you
[1:37:48] how many pigs there was let's go on he
[1:37:50] says
[1:37:52] now and the Devils besought him saying
[1:37:55] say send us to the swine and we'll enter
[1:37:57] into them and Jesus okay and for for
[1:37:59] with Jesus gave them leave wow hey sorry
[1:38:03] Lord Jesus sorry can you just put us in
[1:38:06] the pigs and and not cast us away just
[1:38:09] just put us in pigs the devil knows who
[1:38:12] Christ is they fear and tremble they
[1:38:15] didn't fight back with him he was
[1:38:18] one they were 2,000 and all of us said
[1:38:22] please just send us to the swine one man
[1:38:24] with that Authority sitting within your
[1:38:27] heart sitting right here what can you do
[1:38:31] you can cast out some serious Devils cuz
[1:38:33] it's not you it's the same God that cast
[1:38:36] these the demons out is within you but
[1:38:39] see demons we think it's people
[1:38:41] possessed foaming at the mouth running
[1:38:43] around no it's lust it's
[1:38:48] jealousy it's depression all those
[1:38:51] Spirits it's cancer it's anything that's
[1:38:54] contrary to the word of God and his
[1:38:55] promises that's a demon you can cast it
[1:38:58] out but first meet
[1:39:03] him and he gave them leave and the
[1:39:06] unclean spirits went out and evented
[1:39:09] into the swine and a herd ran over the
[1:39:12] Steep Place into the sea they were about
[1:39:19] 2,000 not a thousand
[1:39:22] 2,000 demons cannot conquer our
[1:39:27] god what can you do if you surrender to
[1:39:30] that God see but see Legion comes now
[1:39:34] and it says when the people came back
[1:39:37] let's just go a little bit on and they
[1:39:38] came back to Jesus and they see the one
[1:39:40] that was possessed with devil verse 15
[1:39:43] and Legion sitting there
[1:39:45] clothed in his right mind isn't it
[1:39:49] strange when devil is stacking you you
[1:39:52] he always wants to take stuff off of you
[1:39:54] yeah he wants to take your hair off he
[1:39:57] want to take your clothes off he wants
[1:39:58] to make it as short as skimpy as he can
[1:40:00] puts as much patches as you as he can he
[1:40:03] wants to dirty you up he wants to
[1:40:05] corrupt you so bad that you look like
[1:40:08] the image of
[1:40:12] Satan he he doesn't build you up he
[1:40:15] brings you down wake up
[1:40:19] amen he would strip you of everything if
[1:40:22] he can because he wants you to dwell on
[1:40:26] the earth with
[1:40:28] him but see Legion found Grace that man
[1:40:32] was not looking for God but God was
[1:40:34] looking for that predestinated seed so
[1:40:37] look here further on we go there to
[1:40:38] verse 19 he says how B Jesus suffered
[1:40:41] him not so Jesus climbs back on the boat
[1:40:43] this man's running to the boat says Lord
[1:40:45] I just want to go with
[1:40:46] you I just want to go with you he says
[1:40:49] no go home and tell th friends tell them
[1:40:51] how great things the Lord has done for
[1:40:53] thee cuz he had compassion on
[1:40:56] thee so he could be a follower of
[1:40:59] Jesus the Rich Young Ruler didn't want
[1:41:02] to be this guy he was happy with his
[1:41:04] riches but this guy after he has been
[1:41:07] delivered said Lord what do I know I'll
[1:41:09] just follow you and he goes you don't
[1:41:10] need to follow me just go testify you
[1:41:13] don't need to be a preacher you don't
[1:41:14] need to be a deacon you don't need to be
[1:41:16] just testify what I've done for you
[1:41:18] today amen you don't need to be a office
[1:41:20] Bearer to be important for Christ you
[1:41:23] need to be a mom and a dad and a real
[1:41:25] brother in a time of need so when your
[1:41:27] bro is doing something wrong you stand
[1:41:29] in the Gap go hey no stop am that's
[1:41:34] being in your position see he didn't say
[1:41:37] to this guy now go preach the gospel and
[1:41:39] spread it wi he says just testify
[1:41:41] testify what I've done for you today so
[1:41:44] he was he was not even in on the lookout
[1:41:47] for God but God came his way amen now
[1:41:51] we're going to go to the one that wants
[1:41:52] a weigh in Luke 15 let's go cuz I don't
[1:41:55] want to wrap this up
[1:41:59] Hallelujah I'll I'll bring us something
[1:42:01] of a Side Story here while we're busy
[1:42:03] with that L um Luke
[1:42:06] 15 Matthew Mark
[1:42:09] Luke are you guys feeling I'm a bit too
[1:42:11] rough today am I are you all
[1:42:14] good sorry I just got a little bit to
[1:42:17] get off my my Fork it's a lot of ha
[1:42:20] don't worry it came my way
[1:42:22] too now Moses I just want to bring you a
[1:42:25] little bit of a parallel Moses where
[1:42:28] children because we want to have a have
[1:42:30] a children Moses was one so okay we had
[1:42:33] the one believer here we go Davey come
[1:42:37] back okay God found the one believer who
[1:42:40] was the first believer who can tell me
[1:42:43] he was a Rich Young
[1:42:45] Ruler okay but the Rich Young
[1:42:48] Ruler he kind of
[1:42:52] he kind of wanted a way out but God
[1:42:54] still went his way at Grace and I
[1:42:57] believe he might not be the bride of
[1:43:00] Christ now I'm just saying it in a nice
[1:43:02] way but he would still be there because
[1:43:05] the Lord knew that he wanted eternal
[1:43:08] life he turned it down though but God
[1:43:11] went his way anyways like the woman at
[1:43:13] the well all those ones it's who
[1:43:14] response to the word but Davy that one
[1:43:17] got returned okay so when you walked
[1:43:20] away from the Lord did you think you'll
[1:43:21] ever come back no never ever that wasn't
[1:43:26] crossing your mind at all okay where are
[1:43:29] you now I've returned amen wait wait
[1:43:32] hold on we've got another one this
[1:43:35] sister that was so uh
[1:43:39] possessed tormented guess what Legion
[1:43:43] got cast out because she heard she got
[1:43:46] pricked and she said Lord forgive meall
[1:43:50] cast this un clean Spirits out of me
[1:43:51] right now am guess what the Lord did
[1:43:56] poor old swine you know the swine was
[1:43:57] more cleverer than most people today cuz
[1:44:00] when they took a
[1:44:02] spirit they they made themselves going
[1:44:04] very very small they ran into the ocean
[1:44:06] where did you come from Sister there you
[1:44:08] go so that sister she was back I need
[1:44:12] one morea there and we all the family
[1:44:17] rejoiced and we did and we're going to
[1:44:21] hallelujah thank you DAV you can sit but
[1:44:23] there's one missing now God said if I
[1:44:27] lose 99 you've got 900 of 100 sheep and
[1:44:30] I lose one what will I
[1:44:33] do9 I leave the 99 so we have one still
[1:44:37] missing but see this one really wants a
[1:44:39] way back something is already working on
[1:44:43] both sides once a way back but God is
[1:44:46] going to send a bit of a trial to get
[1:44:48] this person to a point where they want
[1:44:50] to come come back because remember God
[1:44:52] is not a cookie cutter God one found
[1:44:55] Grace one wanted a way out but one will
[1:44:58] come in he says because all the father
[1:45:00] has given me shall come to me okay so
[1:45:04] Luke 15 who knows the
[1:45:06] story so Jesus actually speaks about
[1:45:09] three things in in the Luke 15 he says a
[1:45:11] lost sheep a lost coin and a lost
[1:45:14] son so who knows the story about the
[1:45:17] prodical
[1:45:18] son we all know this
[1:45:21] can you tell me what
[1:45:23] happened okay so the prodical son goes
[1:45:26] to his dad he says Dad I'm not going to
[1:45:28] read it but it's in scripture write that
[1:45:29] down do it as homework he goes to the
[1:45:31] dad he says Dad just give me give me my
[1:45:34] money all that you were going to give me
[1:45:37] anyways give that
[1:45:38] money Dave you can give my shirt back
[1:45:42] please give me give me my
[1:45:44] money I want to go live it
[1:45:49] up no don't worry I'm going to go live
[1:45:52] it
[1:45:55] up so he
[1:45:57] did the moment he got out of his dad's
[1:46:00] house man he was living it up Arman
[1:46:03] stui he was parting and
[1:46:06] drinking and just doing all kinds of
[1:46:09] things having a ball of his
[1:46:12] life go read that I hope you you read it
[1:46:15] this time with an open
[1:46:17] heart and he got into this country but
[1:46:19] the people weren't his
[1:46:22] people and he started visiting and
[1:46:25] fellowshipping with them all and having
[1:46:26] cool drinks with them all and doing all
[1:46:28] the cool stuff that he cool kids do
[1:46:30] today and you know maybe I'm not cool
[1:46:33] enough started forgetting who he
[1:46:35] is money started
[1:46:38] going cuz his inheritance just went
[1:46:42] spent it
[1:46:43] all end up at a place no job no friends
[1:46:49] no hope
[1:46:51] here's what God did God send the famine
[1:46:55] in that
[1:46:56] country you think it was bad no God can
[1:47:00] make it worse for you but see inside of
[1:47:03] that is a predestinated seed inside of
[1:47:07] that heart not that head that heart God
[1:47:10] is dealing with that young man and he
[1:47:13] finds himself in a pig
[1:47:15] pen man pigs is a theme hey some of them
[1:47:18] run to ocean this guy just finds him EA
[1:47:20] that slop and he looks at this food and
[1:47:23] he gets he gets to
[1:47:26] himself he starts realizing the way I'm
[1:47:29] acting the things I'm doing and what I'm
[1:47:32] saying is hurting
[1:47:34] people I can't carry on like
[1:47:37] this I said man if I can only go back to
[1:47:41] Dad
[1:47:43] David and I can just talk to my dad at
[1:47:46] least I know if he makes me a servant he
[1:47:48] still treats me better in church all the
[1:47:51] Believers treat you better than your
[1:47:54] best friend in the
[1:47:56] world I'm going to say it again I want
[1:47:58] you guys to real you young people listen
[1:48:01] to what I say this is the truth your
[1:48:05] Believers in the church that loves God
[1:48:07] will treat you better than your best
[1:48:09] friend in the
[1:48:10] world because their interest is to see
[1:48:13] you get to God and have a relationship
[1:48:16] with God our interest is here not to
[1:48:18] push you down and preach you to border
[1:48:20] our our whole um place of being here is
[1:48:24] to worship God alone but I'm going to
[1:48:27] tell you something I'm going to worship
[1:48:29] him first before I'm going to look at
[1:48:31] you but when I do see you struggle don't
[1:48:34] you think it burns inside me as
[1:48:36] well when you see somebody going and is
[1:48:39] tired like Ben today comes up and you
[1:48:41] can see man he is really tired he had a
[1:48:43] rough time don't you think I feel same
[1:48:46] but sometimes the things don't work out
[1:48:49] the way you scripted in your head but
[1:48:51] don't change your heart towards the
[1:48:53] people of God because their prayers
[1:48:56] carry you through amen that Dad was
[1:49:00] praying for his son every
[1:49:02] night every morning every day every hour
[1:49:07] every minute it would say Lord when's my
[1:49:10] son coming back I don't I'm not even in
[1:49:13] his position hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:49:17] I'm
[1:49:19] not but there is people that
[1:49:22] is and they praying and they praying and
[1:49:25] they praying but guess what God's going
[1:49:28] to send a fam famine their
[1:49:31] way he's going to make them desperate
[1:49:34] he's going to get them to a point where
[1:49:35] they senses come back to them and then
[1:49:37] he's going to bring them back amen so
[1:49:40] don't stop praying don't stop
[1:49:42] interceding Church of God don't stop
[1:49:46] don't stop whatever we do to judge don't
[1:49:49] stop to think about oh but this or that
[1:49:52] don't think about those things don't
[1:49:56] reason let God do the work if you can if
[1:49:59] you want to further the kingdom of God
[1:50:01] in this Wellington and this shic church
[1:50:04] if you want to do it you stay sincerely
[1:50:08] at him I don't need to know who's going
[1:50:11] through a rough
[1:50:13] time you don't need to come and gossip
[1:50:15] to me and say what's going on with
[1:50:16] Brothers s and so I've got an almighty
[1:50:19] God I can put that burden in my heart to
[1:50:21] preach it I don't want to know
[1:50:24] anything because the moment you say
[1:50:26] anything about the brother and sister
[1:50:28] you're putting a veil over
[1:50:30] them I hope you heard that the moment
[1:50:34] you come and say oh pray for sister this
[1:50:36] and this and pray for that one is that
[1:50:37] is
[1:50:42] wrong because what happens is you're
[1:50:45] trying to do this
[1:50:48] work you're trying to redeem someone
[1:50:50] back to God it's not your job your job
[1:50:53] is to pray if you see it and you got the
[1:50:55] burden you get down on your
[1:50:57] knees I promise you God is big enough to
[1:51:00] make us all know who's going through a
[1:51:02] hard time I don't need to know that
[1:51:04] because what happens is when brother Ben
[1:51:06] and this is maybe brother Ben I do
[1:51:08] apologize for this but it's coming now
[1:51:10] you don't need to tell brother Ben
[1:51:12] what's going on with another family in
[1:51:14] this
[1:51:15] church you don't because if he gets
[1:51:19] behind this pulpit and he wants to pray
[1:51:21] preach against the L Spirit you already
[1:51:23] told him
[1:51:24] that now if he preaches it you'll go oh
[1:51:27] see but sister some so I told him that
[1:51:28] so he knew so it cuts off God out of
[1:51:31] this
[1:51:32] service I'm not saying keep it all quiet
[1:51:35] I'm saying don't give those things to
[1:51:36] your pastor there's deacons that's their
[1:51:41] job so you want to bring someone before
[1:51:43] God bring him before God and if that
[1:51:45] doesn't work or speak to the deacons our
[1:51:48] pastor don't need to know it
[1:51:50] because he needs to come and stand here
[1:51:52] before this church and preach whatever
[1:51:54] God put on his heart and you just take
[1:51:56] it but the moment you said it the moment
[1:52:00] you spoke it you cut the grace of God
[1:52:02] off because now it's not God working
[1:52:04] it's man working and it will never work
[1:52:07] and it will always fall we cannot do
[1:52:10] that church if you really have a burden
[1:52:12] for someone there's two deacons I've
[1:52:15] seen them fight some big fights in this
[1:52:17] church I was one fighting as well
[1:52:20] brother Ed God gave them enough wisdom
[1:52:24] to keep me in line he will do the same
[1:52:26] for you leave brother Ben and Sister
[1:52:28] Christine out of these things it's not
[1:52:31] their place brother Ben is to get the
[1:52:33] spiritual fruit from God come to this
[1:52:36] pulpit and pro be their friends talk to
[1:52:39] them share your burden to them of
[1:52:41] yourself that's fine but they have
[1:52:44] nothing to do with order and conduct and
[1:52:46] all those things we got
[1:52:48] policemen
[1:52:50] okay they can keep me in order I promise
[1:52:52] that they can keep you in
[1:52:54] order he disclaimer okay remember I
[1:52:58] speak English in self-defense so if
[1:52:59] anything this sounds harsh just remember
[1:53:02] I love brother
[1:53:04] Ben 100% but I want brother B to tell me
[1:53:07] off when he wants to tell me off because
[1:53:10] then I know God is doing the work
[1:53:11] through him amen so I ain't telling
[1:53:13] brother B anything in my life except
[1:53:16] that God is good and he's dealing with
[1:53:17] me but with them I go Pro
[1:53:21] Ed it's been a rough
[1:53:23] one because that's my Channel please can
[1:53:27] you do that if you fellowship with him
[1:53:29] and brother B ask you a question you'll
[1:53:31] be honest you're answering that's
[1:53:32] different that's leading by the Lord
[1:53:34] don't run and phone and do all those
[1:53:36] things and use the deacons that wasn't
[1:53:38] in my notes but I thought I'll just put
[1:53:40] it in on anyways so the lost son comes
[1:53:44] back to his dad dad wakes up the morning
[1:53:47] and and looks on the horizon and it's
[1:53:49] old dusty road and he sees something
[1:53:52] coming and he's like w still bit far
[1:53:56] away Lord but could that be my
[1:53:59] son because it kind of looks like him
[1:54:03] I've been praying now for a couple of
[1:54:05] years but I look and it Lord please let
[1:54:08] that be mine there was many of people
[1:54:09] Cross by but this one just looks
[1:54:12] different says Lord I Just Praise my son
[1:54:16] Hallelujah I'm going to praise you it's
[1:54:18] my son and he started coming
[1:54:21] closer and his head was hung and he
[1:54:24] didn't know where to hide gets to his
[1:54:27] dad his dead I stuffed
[1:54:31] up all that you gave me I lost every
[1:54:35] little bit of it gone I wasted it I

[1:54:48] me that go goes hold
[1:54:51] on go get that fatted go grabs his son

[1:54:58] him he says welcome

[1:55:06] understand what just
[1:55:07] happened you might not understand why
[1:55:09] rank cner would walk through the doors
[1:55:11] and get saved by
[1:55:13] God but he's
[1:55:16] home he he he made it back home safe
[1:55:21] he didn't die in that pig pen he got to
[1:55:24] his senses he came back home you dads
[1:55:27] are speak today to you no matter what
[1:55:30] your sons go through and I'm talking
[1:55:33] about the son specifically that's my
[1:55:35] burden you receive them
[1:55:38] back receive them back in the name of
[1:55:41] our Lord Jesus Christ CU remember you
[1:55:44] will get tested and you must get tested
[1:55:46] because if you get tested God knows your
[1:55:49] rest child and if he never goes through
[1:55:51] a test all your fathers if your son
[1:55:53] don't go through a test he's just
[1:55:55] another
[1:55:57] clone just a clone he's do a chip off
[1:56:00] the old block but the moment he finds
[1:56:03] his identity in Christ and he comes back
[1:56:07] amen then it's different
[1:56:09] Hallelujah but sometimes they have to go
[1:56:11] just squander it out in the
[1:56:15] world I got a huge burden for these
[1:56:18] young ones they got what a massive
[1:56:20] battle now I'll talk about
[1:56:23] Moses he's living in Pharaoh's
[1:56:27] Palace Pharaoh every morning looks over
[1:56:30] comes to a big window looks at all the
[1:56:33] slaves man I got a great Kingdom I got a
[1:56:35] lot of slaves but these
[1:56:37] slaves there are a lot of them so he
[1:56:39] starts calling them little Moses by
[1:56:43] God's hand divine intervention brings
[1:56:45] him to Pharaoh's daughter raises Pharaoh
[1:56:47] raises him as a son he's the next Air to
[1:56:50] the throne he's got riches he's got
[1:56:53] women he's got popularity he's like the
[1:56:56] Leonel Messi and the Ronaldo of all he's
[1:56:59] got
[1:57:01] everything he looks at those Hebrews and
[1:57:03] he says they're all
[1:57:05] slaves one day Moses walks up to that
[1:57:08] window and he looks out and he sees
[1:57:11] those
[1:57:11] people and he says my
[1:57:15] people I I want to be with them he looks
[1:57:20] behind him and he's got all the riches
[1:57:21] of the
[1:57:22] world he's got everything on tap but he
[1:57:26] looks at his people and he decides you
[1:57:28] know what I'm going to go down and visit
[1:57:30] that people hallelujah and he goes down
[1:57:33] and he gets to the first place and he's
[1:57:34] been there many a times but today God
[1:57:36] was dealing with his heart he wanted a
[1:57:39] way in he didn't want a way
[1:57:42] out and he gets there and he sees one
[1:57:44] slave being beaten and he beats up the
[1:57:46] guy buries him in
[1:57:48] sand next day goes to his own people and
[1:57:51] he's starting to talk to two brothers
[1:57:53] fighting and they go oh you just killed
[1:57:54] the Egyptian yesterday who you now he
[1:57:57] runs for his life see now things got
[1:57:59] hard for Moses real hard and he takes
[1:58:02] his family and he runs away and he hides
[1:58:05] 40 years God was
[1:58:08] dealing 40 years God was dealing because
[1:58:11] he had a plan for him to return but see
[1:58:14] sometimes they have to go through the
[1:58:16] trials to become one of us
[1:58:20] listen they have to go through the
[1:58:21] trials to become one of us God was still
[1:58:24] dealing with Moses God had such plans
[1:58:26] for Moses that Moses didn't know about
[1:58:30] Moses couldn't even speak he still made
[1:58:31] a way for Aaron to come and speak to him
[1:58:34] God came to Moses and got to Moses when
[1:58:37] God wanted to deal with Moses it might
[1:58:39] not look like that devil is moving but
[1:58:42] God has a Time In A Line in the Sand
[1:58:45] where he will deal with that person and
[1:58:48] if he deals with it it's a perfect
[1:58:51] finished work that's
[1:58:53] it get your hands off get your knees on
[1:58:58] then we win it amen amen so when we see
[1:59:02] things go wrong remember Moses back
[1:59:06] linen God made him a
[1:59:08] prophet the prodical son as lost as
[1:59:11] could be God brought him back what is
[1:59:14] anything to a hard for God Amen and
[1:59:18] we'll close with what brother Isaac

[1:59:30] there now I get very passionate about

[1:59:37] my heart get your hands off of God's
[1:59:40] work and let God
[1:59:42] work because we only get in his
[1:59:47] way amen we go there to verse

[2:00:22] the bread of life he that cometh to me
[2:00:24] shall never hunger and he that believeth
[2:00:27] on me shall never thirst next
[2:00:31] verse says but I say unto you that ye
[2:00:35] also have seen me and not believed
[2:00:37] not I'll go back to my
[2:00:41] word he says but I say unto you that you
[2:00:44] have also seen me and believe not but
[2:00:46] all that the father has given me
[2:00:50] shall come to me and him that cometh to
[2:00:54] me I will no wise cast out so you got a
[2:00:57] choice
[2:00:59] believer you can come
[2:01:01] running like
[2:01:04] Legion you can go test your strength in
[2:01:07] the world like the prodical son and get
[2:01:09] burned and have

[2:01:23] is contrary to the word of God you have
[2:01:24] a choice where you can surrender it and
[2:01:27] you can live an overcoming life
[2:01:28] Hallelujah and Isaac started with the
[2:01:30] scripture he says because I have Waters
[2:01:33] of life and I will give it you in an
[2:01:36] abundance I'll give you all that water
[2:01:39] just come and
[2:01:41] drink just give up just for long enough
[2:01:44] so God can deal with you just long
[2:01:48] enough don't stay in Pride don't stay in
[2:01:52] the world just for long enough let him

[2:01:56] hallelujah
[2:01:58] amen and this is the Father which have
[2:02:01] sent me and of all that have given to me

[2:02:10] this is the will of him that sent me
[2:02:13] that everyone which seeth the son and
[2:02:16] believeth on him may have everlasting
[2:02:19] life and I will raise him up at the last
[2:02:23] day that's not my words as his
[2:02:27] words amen may the Lord just bless let's

[2:02:35] pray and I'll ask brother Isaac to close
[2:02:38] the the service for
[2:02:40] us if everybody just bows their
[2:02:44] heads close their
[2:02:47] eyes now this last

[2:03:21] because God does a finished
[2:03:24] work and when you come from God you go
[2:03:27] back to God and all these children came
[2:03:30] back to God because they were cut from
[2:03:33] the same

[2:04:10] either is running away or so possessed
[2:04:14] in such a place that they don't know
[2:04:16] what to
[2:04:17] do or even like the prodical son want to
[2:04:21] go try the world and fail miserably
[2:04:24] because that's what happens because God
[2:04:26] will make it hard if there's anyone like
[2:04:28] this here I pray that you raise your
[2:04:30] hand so our lord Jesus just knows the
[2:04:34] uplifted hand is what testifies to
[2:04:37] Heaven and Earth and underneath the word

[2:06:50] run to him and they grab him and they
[2:06:52] say Dad you're back what
[2:06:55] happened he said I met the Lord
[2:06:59] Jesus a man of Galilee stepped on the
[2:07:02] shores Hallelujah and everything inside

[2:07:10] to get rid of all of this filth and and
[2:07:13] all of this
[2:07:14] lasciviousness I fell at his feet and I

[2:07:25] Spirit out of me I'm a changed man
[2:07:28] Hallelujah and the people rejoiced with
[2:07:30] him and they shouted and praised and
