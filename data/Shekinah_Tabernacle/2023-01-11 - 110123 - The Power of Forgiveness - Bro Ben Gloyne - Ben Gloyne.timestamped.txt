[24:45] so if you ever want to go and have a
[24:46] great time with someone take this guy
[24:48] you're in for a blessed time so
[24:50] um
[24:53] all right yeah that was good so it's
[24:55] been a great thing to Journey around
[24:56] this old globe with this Brother Bear
[24:57] I'm here fellowship with God's children
[24:59] everywhere and you know I come to find
[25:01] out where they're Swedish Norwegian
[25:03] German African wherever or wherever they
[25:06] are they're all the same when they come
[25:07] to Christ it makes everyone the same
[25:10] there's no difference in people I maybe
[25:12] can't speak their language but there's
[25:14] something about them you know you can
[25:16] tell that it's a brother that's the real
[25:18] part of it after all it's so true true
[25:21] man praise God we're in places couldn't
[25:23] speak well much English well they
[25:25] couldn't well I I can't speak much
[25:26] English anyway but you know um but yeah
[25:29] it was a real blessing so as you know
[25:30] when to went to the motherland went to
[25:33] South Africa praise the Lord hey my dad
[25:35] comes from this place so I can say at
[25:37] some other land I can claim it I claim a
[25:39] lot of things you know kiwi wherever it
[25:41] suits hey it's me you know I know it's
[25:44] naughty hey but hey
[25:45] um so we're up in this region of the
[25:47] country I just got another we'll zoom in
[25:49] a bit so
[25:50] we landed in Johannesburg we uh we
[25:54] stayed in emalahini here and then
[25:56] bushbuck Ridge where we preached the
[25:58] first amount of meetings is in here
[26:00] between uh Aiken hook and uh has evil
[26:04] yes it's in here so we were there and
[26:06] then we went up to mahola which is by
[26:08] Hood Sprite here then we drove through
[26:10] the um through the Kruger now the Kruger
[26:12] National Park is half the size of this
[26:14] North Island
[26:15] that's a that's a national park so this
[26:20] is a big place man this is a big place
[26:21] oh wow so yeah just to give you an idea
[26:23] so um and then we drove down to
[26:26] mumbbella is that how you said it
[26:28] for one night service and then we drove
[26:31] here down back to imalakini remote to
[26:33] polokwane
[26:35] um so we had quite a time yes
[26:38] um so the first part I've just got a
[26:39] bunch of videos we're just going to kind
[26:41] of Brother Andy you just chip in because
[26:42] man I tell you what this man's gold
[26:46] praise Lords here we are driving
[26:48] bushbuck Ridge just to give you an idea
[26:49] you know there's some you know there's a
[26:51] lot of houses a lot of open land a lot
[26:53] of you know but there's no industry
[26:55] there uh much apart from agriculture
[26:58] every tree is a mango tree uh you can
[27:00] maybe skip this a bit forward yeah just
[27:02] so this is the idea of this is what
[27:03] bushbuck Ridge is like
[27:05] um there's no church there at the moment
[27:06] by the pastor Moses muruti Moses has had
[27:09] a burden for for this part of the
[27:11] country to to establish a work so he's
[27:13] been going up there and we've actually
[27:15] last year we were supporting him to do
[27:17] that and um so they just hired this uh
[27:20] this is a Community Hall that they hired
[27:21] for the meetings and yeah wait we've got
[27:23] next one because it'll just it'll just
[27:25] say oh here we are yep so this is what
[27:27] it's like the free-range animals the
[27:29] cows know where they come from and they
[27:30] know how to get back home so there's a
[27:33] Shepherd there but I think they just
[27:34] kind of self-driving amazing technology
[27:36] GPS
[27:37] um so so here's the meeting Hall so
[27:40] these were Outreach meetings but the um
[27:42] but but a lot of Believers came not just
[27:44] from Brother Moses church but from many
[27:46] different Church so it was a great real
[27:48] great Unity among the people everyone
[27:50] just just rallied behind it and it was a
[27:52] real blessed time he says there's
[27:54] Brother Andy teaching them um I took the
[27:57] enemy's camp
[27:58] so um but they loved Brother Andy and
[28:01] Brother Andy love them we had a good
[28:03] time you know how you know our brother
[28:04] says that you know when you love someone
[28:07] they know it they can feel it so this
[28:09] guy was just oozing love and they loved
[28:12] him amen that was really awesome so yeah
[28:14] we had a great time so it was 30
[28:16] something degrees it was thinking it was
[28:18] 50 degrees Maybe
[28:20] it felt like it anyway yeah
[28:23] yeah yes this is now this brother Moses
[28:25] there leading some songs after one of
[28:27] the services
[28:29] um yes it was very loud you could feel
[28:32] the music oh yeah it was like you
[28:34] wouldn't be able to die in one of these
[28:36] Services because you'd get resuscitated
[28:38] by the base
[28:40] yeah it was awesome but within this
[28:42] crowd there were people from the local
[28:43] community and yeah so it was good to
[28:46] hear some of the Believers so this is a
[28:48] good friend of brother um poor
[28:52] yeah brother dumasani
[28:54] to people and his family there that's uh
[28:58] brother Moses and that's his wife here
[29:00] and some of the boys are theirs and some
[29:03] of the boys are there so you know and
[29:04] yeah anyway but it was really powerful I
[29:06] don't know if I have it next but Brother
[29:08] Andy gave his testimony this is between
[29:09] one of the services they made a
[29:11] semicircle and he shared his testimony
[29:12] and it really spoke to a lot of the
[29:14] young people
[29:15] and I think there's about what how many
[29:17] about seven eight people were baptized I
[29:20] think and most of them were young people
[29:21] and by the end he was preaching on
[29:23] identity and weaved at him with his
[29:24] testimony very powerful and it really
[29:27] spoke to them real real good you know
[29:29] because especially in this community
[29:30] there's a lot of drinking there's a lot
[29:32] of drugs there's people have nothing to
[29:33] do yeah literally nothing to do they
[29:36] just it's just crazy how you watch them
[29:38] and they're just walking around and they
[29:40] don't have sports like the worldly
[29:41] people here they have sports I mean I'm
[29:44] not saying your worldly if you go and do
[29:45] sports but that's what the world does
[29:47] that's all they have yeah they don't
[29:49] even have that there's no one to
[29:50] organize that stuff they just wander and
[29:52] aimless yeah so they need the Lord
[29:54] it's a good opportunity
[29:56] yeah
[29:58] so we were there oh so now here we are
[30:00] brother Andy's about to experience
[30:02] mangoes I just thought I'd put this in
[30:03] here because we're people too you know
[30:05] we're not all like anyway
[30:07] um this is we if you haven't tried these
[30:09] mangoes if you've only eaten mangoes in
[30:11] New Zealand you haven't had mangoes yet
[30:13] literally it's not even the same species
[30:16] I'm sure
[30:18] one of these mangoes had like a popcorn
[30:20] aftertaste it was amazing oh it was so
[30:22] good anyway so that was good and then
[30:24] most of their grass actually peanut
[30:25] bushes because that's what they grow
[30:26] there too very sandy soil but it's
[30:28] perfect for that and here we are
[30:29] McDonald's trying to trying the food as
[30:31] well we had a great I think in
[30:33] Fellowship it was really good with the
[30:35] brothers and stuff we had a real good
[30:36] time you know they broke down some
[30:38] barriers and had some great times and
[30:40] then we went to after so so we've kind
[30:42] of jumped but we've gone from Bush back
[30:43] bridge we've gone down to mumbbella and
[30:46] then we've come down to this is in
[30:49] Johannesburg so brother Matt would know
[30:51] a few of these people because this is
[30:52] his family so it's his dad their brother
[30:54] Glenn that's his brother Mark gav Kevin
[30:57] all right and that's brother Donnie
[31:00] who's gonna be here hopefully this
[31:01] weekend yes so it's uh Maria's uh dead
[31:05] Maria Donaldson yeah and yeah there's us
[31:07] turn there's brother Moses so we went to
[31:09] uh so brother Matt's sister's place and
[31:13] her husband uh Rick
[31:16] so he was the one we prayed for a while
[31:17] ago had the cancer and remember it got
[31:19] into the cartilage and it stopped and
[31:21] apparently it doesn't normally happen so
[31:23] he was still on I think he just finished
[31:25] his chemo he wasn't very well he wasn't
[31:27] in this photo
[31:28] um and when we were there he couldn't
[31:29] eat anything solid he's just having
[31:30] protein shakes and things but then after
[31:33] we've left we've heard that he started
[31:34] eating solar food again is that right so
[31:36] praise the Lord yeah yeah so um
[31:38] praise God but we really praying more
[31:40] that the Lord would bring him bring him
[31:41] home to him yes you know but but he
[31:43] actually asked for prayer and he's very
[31:45] emotional way well he cried so we we we
[31:47] got together and prayed and then the
[31:50] presence of the Lord was very real and
[31:52] he he began crying in the room so yeah
[31:54] he was touched
[31:57] that was awesome now I think I've
[31:59] actually missed out I put this out of
[32:01] order but now we're going to go sorry
[32:02] now we're at the drug rehabilitation
[32:04] center so Brother Andy was invited to
[32:06] this drug rehabilitation center this in
[32:08] a informal settlement just south of or
[32:11] west of emalahini wherever it is and
[32:13] these are all guys who are in a
[32:15] Christian drug rehab
[32:17] and um it was very powerful there too
[32:19] all they had was a drum
[32:22] listen
[32:26] that's all you need
[32:27] a Bible and a drum Ellen you can have
[32:30] wish and then yeah so there's a yes

[32:45] music so he asked can we pray against
[32:47] this tavern oh yeah so we pray that the
[32:49] tavern owner would become a Christian
[32:51] amen you know so hey God can destroy
[32:53] what like the time of uh you know you
[32:55] know on the back in the day people yeah

[36:56] love about the African people is that
[36:57] they're not critical
[36:59] oh and I was thinking man we need to we
[37:01] need to absorb that yeah something goes
[37:03] wrong praise God let's just walk off
[37:05] doesn't matter it doesn't matter no you
[37:07] know lots goes wrong we may just carry

[37:46] South Africans know how to celebrate oh

[37:53] any sort of reason to celebrate it's a
[37:55] big party and it's people and families

[38:04] hallelujah praise the Lord I think we
[38:06] should celebrate so yeah so we had um
[38:10] five services in Bush buck five here
[38:12] then a couple between so I was quite
[38:15] busy but it was great we just fed off
[38:16] each other and um I think the Lord
[38:18] really did a work so
[38:20] I don't know if I have any more oh yes
[38:22] and then we're at mug and Bean
[38:24] uh at the airport this is just before we
[38:26] left
[38:27] that cheese
[38:31] with a muffin and butter
[38:34] yeah
[38:35] I was very skeptical
[38:37] but it actually works you have to try it
[38:42] it was wonderful yeah I think that's the
[38:44] last one you go so I just kind of there
[38:46] was one thing I I really enjoyed was
[38:48] they just passed the microphone to the
[38:50] sisters
[38:51] at in the service and they just sing and
[38:55] the whole place is just filled with
[38:56] music yeah that the singing I mean it
[38:58] was definitely filled with music but the
[39:01] singing I mean it was just such another
[39:03] dimension and they could sing yeah oh
[39:05] yeah yeah and I realized where sister
[39:08] sippy gets it from
[39:10] it pays a lot that's singing voice it's
[39:13] amazing so praise the Lord yeah that was
[39:15] wonderful yeah
[39:16] um I think yeah but it was a real
[39:18] blessed trip that was real good made
[39:20] some real good lifelong friends yes but
[39:24] it's heaven right so you go there you
[39:26] see a bit of Heaven you want everyone to
[39:28] come this side but you come the side and
[39:29] he goes yeah it's like you go to a camp
[39:31] somewhere you want everyone to move
[39:32] where you are but it's just heaven right
[39:34] because you just Same Spirit so yeah it
[39:36] was real good praise a lot I think I
[39:39] think that's us
[39:40] praise the Lord okay God bless you so so
[39:42] that was our report
[39:46] if you want to hear any more we can fill
[39:48] you in on details but you know we had a
[39:50] lot of uh exciting times
[39:52] anyway yeah
[39:53] um okay let's stand shall we tonight
[39:55] we're just going to have a prayer
[39:56] meeting
[39:57] um
[39:58] uh but we're gonna go to Mark 11 now
[40:00] when
[40:02] that last service we were in we only had
[40:04] because we had to catch a plane a
[40:06] certain time we're in polokwane we had
[40:08] to drive through hours we only had a
[40:10] very short time to speak but the Lord
[40:12] really touched the people with this
[40:14] topic and I just can't get it off my
[40:15] heart so I'm gonna I'm gonna speak it to
[40:17] you
[40:18] um which brother Billy Williams spoke a
[40:21] few years ago but I think it's good to
[40:22] revisit these things
[40:24] um so we're going to go to Mark 11 and
[40:27] 22. and we're going to read it says and
[40:31] Jesus answering saith unto them have
[40:33] faith in God
[40:36] for very I send you that whosoever shall
[40:38] say unto this mountain be thou removed
[40:40] and be thou cast into the sea and shall
[40:41] not doubt in his heart but shall believe
[40:43] that those things which he saith shall
[40:45] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[40:48] saith therefore I say unto you what's in
[40:51] what things over ye desire When you pray
[40:53] believe that you receive them and ye
[40:55] shall have them
[40:57] and when you stand praying forgive if ye
[41:00] have ought against any that your father
[41:02] also which is in heaven May forgive you
[41:04] your trespasses amen let's just bow
[41:07] heads once again
[41:08] Lord Jesus the Lord there could have
[41:10] been many other things we could have
[41:12] said there Lord You've Done many things
[41:13] Lord we want to praise your name you
[41:15] kept us safe you kept our family safe
[41:17] and now we're back together once again
[41:19] and Lord as we've just read from your
[41:21] holy word I pray dear God that you Lord
[41:23] the great author would come and touch
[41:24] every life Lord You're the one we need
[41:26] in this moment dear God so may you come
[41:28] and take control of Our Lives For Your
[41:29] Glory anoint speaker and hero one more
[41:31] time we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen
[41:34] amen God bless you friends you may have
[41:36] your seats uh tonight so I want to talk
[41:39] about the power of forgiveness now we
[41:41] all want the power of the you know
[41:42] there's the power of the spoken word
[41:43] we're living in the time of the third
[41:45] Paul and you know we know this is more
[41:47] than buzzwords but it's creative Powers
[41:49] placed in the in the mouth of the Bride
[41:51] you know of the bride of Christ and we
[41:53] have power to speak creation the thing
[41:56] is perfect Faith which we just read
[41:58] about that perfect Faith to move
[41:59] mountains is bound with forgiveness so
[42:02] many people want the power of God but
[42:04] they're not willing to make the
[42:05] sacrifice to get the power of God and
[42:07] that sacrifice is actually forgiving you
[42:10] know it's quite amazing such a simple
[42:12] thing uh can you know can uh be so
[42:15] simple off forgiveness it seems like
[42:17] very Elementary Sunday school topic but
[42:19] it's very powerful it's very vital in
[42:21] every stage of our Christian walk that
[42:23] we cannot hold anything against anyone
[42:25] and if we do it actually just binds us
[42:28] so I I want to be Unbound today I want
[42:30] to be free to walk with God I don't want
[42:32] to be bound in my own little pity things
[42:34] that are relative to what he has done
[42:36] for me you know I want to walk with him
[42:37] because he wants us to walk with him you
[42:40] know so so perfect Faith the power of
[42:43] the third Paul is tied to forgiveness if
[42:46] you do not forgive he will not forgive
[42:48] you it's that simple I want to be
[42:50] forgiven right it doesn't matter if you
[42:52] think you're good or bad whatever I want
[42:54] to be forgiven right so if you're not
[42:57] willing to forgive he will not forgive
[42:58] you that's that is if you read it in
[43:00] your Bible or read Letter Bible leads
[43:01] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ so
[43:04] there will be trials along the way we
[43:06] understand that our faith will be tried
[43:08] now this is from three different Bible
[43:10] versions here the King James is the top
[43:12] under the trial of your faith being much
[43:14] more precious than of gold that
[43:15] perisheth though it betrayed with fire
[43:17] might be found under praise and honor
[43:19] and Glory the peering of Jesus Christ so
[43:21] our faith will be put on trial now the
[43:23] English Standard Version it says so that
[43:25] they tested genuineness of your faith
[43:28] so so your faith is going to be tested
[43:30] whether it's a genuine Faith or not so
[43:33] so a genuine faith will stay with the
[43:35] word regardless it will it will take the
[43:37] word of God above feelings above
[43:39] imagination but what someone said your
[43:41] past your history your present it will
[43:43] take the word of God above all those
[43:45] things a faith that is not genuine is
[43:48] just one while everyone else my friends
[43:50] are in church so I'll be in church or my
[43:52] family's in church therefore I'm going
[43:54] to be in church that is not a genuine
[43:55] Faith right all the food's good so I'm
[43:57] going to come or the music's good so I'm
[43:59] going to come or you know you know that
[44:01] guy who preaches once in a while yeah
[44:02] yeah he sounds okay so I'm going to come
[44:04] that's not genuine faith and that faith
[44:07] will be tried and it will collapse it'll
[44:09] have a critical structural failure and
[44:12] it will fall apart so so our faith will
[44:15] be tested whether it's a genuine Faith
[44:17] or not which is what he says here and
[44:19] then also the the brilliant Standard
[44:21] Bible says that the proven character of
[44:24] your faith
[44:25] so the character of your faith what is
[44:27] the character of your faith is it a
[44:29] selfish faith I'm just here for me we're
[44:31] not just here for ourselves we're here
[44:33] for each other right a Divine gift is
[44:35] for not the person who has it but it's
[44:37] for someone else and we all have a
[44:39] Divine gift of faith it may operate in
[44:41] different ways by singing preaching
[44:43] praying whatever it may be but it's
[44:44] still not for ourselves it's for one
[44:47] another Amen brother Graham had that
[44:49] stomach issue came up every seven years
[44:50] and he would yet he would touch people
[44:52] and they'd be healed in there thousands
[44:54] and hundreds but yet he had that thing
[44:56] why because the gift in his life wasn't
[44:57] for himself amen it's the same thing
[45:00] with Paul he had that infirmity in his
[45:01] flesh all those different things but yet
[45:03] he you know he had a he had an anointed
[45:06] powerful Holy Ghost filled Ministry but
[45:09] yet he would suffer with those things
[45:10] why because that Divine gift in his life
[45:13] was for the people so so the character
[45:15] of our faith is going to be proved you
[45:17] know you know a bad character has bad
[45:19] attributes and it's manifested in a bad
[45:21] way so a bad character of ways stealing
[45:23] cheating lying all those kind of things
[45:26] is manifested in a life the same thing
[45:28] with a bad character of Faith now if
[45:30] it's a selfish faith if it's only if
[45:32] well if you're good to me I'll be good
[45:33] to you that's a bad faith that is not
[45:36] the character of Jesus Christ as a faith
[45:38] you know because real faith is tied to
[45:40] me to Divine love where it doesn't
[45:42] matter how you treat me I'm still going
[45:44] to love you anyway that's how that's how
[45:46] our faith should be sure because Jesus
[45:49] said of you know if if you get smitten
[45:50] in One Cheek give them the other one
[45:52] that should be our faith right so so the
[45:55] character or the genuiness of our faith
[45:57] is going to be tried it's going to be
[45:59] put to the test you know and and we may
[46:01] think we cannot stand the test but the
[46:03] Lord knows what we have need of and the
[46:05] Lord knows what we can go through and he
[46:08] wants to prove to you if your faith is
[46:10] genuine or not
[46:12] praise God Amen that's what it is
[46:14] because actually if you think about it
[46:16] if your faith is not genuine and you and
[46:18] and something comes in your life and
[46:20] your son is not genuine then you can
[46:21] actually go to God and repent and get
[46:23] him to build rebuild your life that
[46:25] you're no longer living a lie but he can
[46:27] say he can come to you and say hey you
[46:29] need genuine you need my faith you don't
[46:31] need human Faith you need my faith see
[46:33] the Apostle Peter had had a faith that
[46:36] was not genuine in the beginning yet he
[46:38] had the Revelation now at the Christ the
[46:39] son of the Living God but it was human
[46:41] Faith but there's a part of him that
[46:43] wasn't dead yet so when the when the
[46:45] testing of his faith the character of
[46:47] his faith came to the test he failed
[46:49] there's a critical structural failure in
[46:51] his life he was standing by you know so
[46:54] so he would he would look in the eyes of
[46:56] the Lord Jesus and say I'll never
[46:58] forsake thee I'm going to stand with you
[47:00] I've got a sword I'm ready to die with
[47:01] you you know but then but then when his
[47:04] faith was put to the test and he'll be
[47:05] warming himself by a fire outside of
[47:08] Pilot's judgment Hall just to see what's
[47:09] going on and a woman would come to and
[47:11] say hey aren't you one of them aren't
[47:13] you one of them here's the same one who
[47:15] said I'll never forsake you because the
[47:17] Buckle under the questioning of just a
[47:19] one random woman not the Sanhedrin not a
[47:21] high priest just a random woman who
[47:23] happened to be there then another one
[47:25] asked the same question then another one
[47:26] and I said even your speech betrays you
[47:29] so so how you're acting how you're
[47:31] talking to me actually portrays to you
[47:33] that you're actually a Christian but
[47:35] because his faith wasn't genuine it was
[47:37] a human faith it fell apart
[47:39] that's why we need Divine faith we need
[47:42] the faith of the Son of God I'm going to
[47:44] move through this fairly quickly because
[47:46] we're going to have a time of prayer but
[47:47] I trust it really it really anchors down
[47:50] deep because we're going to beat this is
[47:52] a year that we should really be
[47:53] soul-searching
[47:54] because we don't want to be disappointed
[47:57] on that day
[47:59] we want to go the full Assurance I know
[48:01] in whom I have believed my faith is
[48:03] genuine because I can look back at my
[48:04] life with someone treated me bad I love
[48:06] them anyhow I didn't hold the grudge
[48:08] there's nothing in me that could hold a
[48:09] grudge I could never hold any resentment
[48:11] there was nothing in me that could hold
[48:12] it you know like a civil something it
[48:14] can't hold water right we're going to be
[48:16] like that when it comes to any malice or
[48:18] Strife or envy that tries to pour into
[48:20] our lives we're just full of holes it
[48:22] just goes through oh where did that go I
[48:24] don't know I'm not looking for it but
[48:25] it's gone right because the devil wants
[48:27] to pull us full of porous full of malice
[48:29] and strife and trouble and all those
[48:31] things but if our faith is genuine it
[48:33] will pull right through because it's
[48:36] incredible when you know what people do
[48:39] out of out of out of annoyance and they
[48:41] claim they're worshiping God you know
[48:43] Henry VII we know he started the
[48:45] Anglican Church
[48:46] the reason he started that church is
[48:48] because the Catholic Church wouldn't let
[48:49] him get remarried or wouldn't let him
[48:51] get divorced so on a tantrum he started
[48:54] his own movement
[48:55] and that's how it was birthed
[48:57] you know people do things for a lot less
[48:58] they go start their own church go split
[49:01] fellowships go leave churches go do
[49:03] other things claiming to be serving God
[49:05] but yet their faith is not pure their
[49:07] faith is not genuine because they're
[49:08] annoyed at someone else and how often do
[49:11] people worship God in the message but
[49:12] it's the wrath of man praising God
[49:14] they're annoyed at someone else the
[49:16] reason they're still a Believer is
[49:17] because they want to prove to someone
[49:18] else they're going to stand there'll
[49:20] come a time when that Faith which is not
[49:21] genuine will buckle right so we don't
[49:24] want to be worshiping God out of because
[49:25] I'm annoyed at someone else or that
[49:27] church does this or this person said
[49:29] this whatever more we want to be
[49:31] Believers because God has called us he
[49:33] first loved us that down Calvary and we
[49:35] love him in response that's why I'm a
[49:37] Christian right that's how we should be
[49:38] amen amen that's how we should be
[49:40] because he first loved me I love him in
[49:42] return amen I do not be a Christian to
[49:45] try and earn anything no he earned it
[49:46] for me that day on Calvary I'm just
[49:48] living as a Christian out of
[49:49] appreciation amen that he looked beyond
[49:52] my faults and saw my need and that's the
[49:54] thing we're really a genuine faith will
[49:56] look beyond the fault of a person right
[49:59] we may not get the answer straight away
[50:00] but we'll be praying saying Lord how can
[50:03] I help this person right and normally
[50:05] Jesus said the way to help someone is to
[50:07] get the beam out of your own eye
[50:09] then you can see what's in there oh
[50:11] that's a you know that's actually the
[50:12] best thing to help you say Lord help me
[50:15] change my vision that I could maybe help
[50:18] my brother
[50:19] Hallelujah because remember this this
[50:21] whole this whole walk is actually a self
[50:24] checking up walk that God would examine
[50:26] and change us and do surgery that were
[50:28] made in His image
[50:30] things will happen in families things
[50:32] will happen in churches you say well the
[50:34] issue is this no actually that's big no
[50:36] no the issue is this but it's not this
[50:37] it's actually what's the defect in our
[50:39] character that needs to be changed
[50:40] that's what that's why Trials come up
[50:42] it's something in us that needs to be
[50:43] molded and shaped praise God I'm glad
[50:46] I'm on his operating table I'm glad I'm
[50:48] on his wheel and he's molding me how
[50:50] does he mold me through trouble he
[50:51] allows things to come up and you and you
[50:53] know maybe something happens to you and
[50:55] it bothers you that's good then you can
[50:57] go to Lord and prayer and say Lord why
[50:58] do I fill this way against these people
[51:00] why have I emotionally shut off and
[51:02] disconnected myself and you know I find
[51:04] that's my biggest challenge
[51:06] with people I just I just maybe it's a
[51:09] coping mechanism and it bothers me
[51:11] like Lord I don't want to be like this I
[51:13] want to have a feeling I want to have a
[51:15] love not just an annoyance not just a
[51:16] well put them in a box and that's just
[51:18] their light in life and they're stuck
[51:19] that way that's wrong I'm I'm actually
[51:22] preaching to myself right now well we
[51:24] can't just put people in a box and say
[51:25] well or take a photo of them and say
[51:27] that's how they be for the rest of their
[51:29] life
[51:30] are you God
[51:32] but why do we why do we act like God
[51:34] towards people are they never going to
[51:36] get saved they're always going to be
[51:37] foolisher is going to be in and out and
[51:39] full of trouble who says you know no if
[51:41] we have a genuine Faith we'll look
[51:43] beyond their fault and see their need
[51:44] right because the Lord Jesus looked
[51:46] beyond your fault isn't it amazing
[51:48] Before Time Ever began he looked through
[51:50] the strands of time he knew all the sin
[51:52] you'd do he knew you'd be born in sin to
[51:54] begin with he knew you'd be born lost
[51:56] and everything you'd do against him
[52:00] did that stop him from going to Calvary
[52:01] for you no he saw a joy set before him
[52:06] which was you redeemed Made In His Image
[52:07] and Eternity and I think Lord give us a
[52:10] vision of one another that we can have a
[52:13] joy set before us when there's a clash
[52:15] or something that we can look beyond the
[52:17] now and see the end for that person they
[52:20] won't be stuck in this fight but they'll
[52:21] be redeemed through it I mean because
[52:23] we've got to believe for one another
[52:24] right we should have faith not just for
[52:26] ourselves but for one another amen but
[52:28] the thing is of our faith is genuine we
[52:30] will but if our faith is not genuine we
[52:32] won't
[52:33] because genuine Faith does not want to
[52:36] lift themselves up
[52:38] genuine Faith actually wants to be a
[52:40] servant of all and wants everyone else
[52:42] to be lifted up that's what Jesus did he
[52:44] says I've not come to minister but to
[52:46] I'm not going to be ministered to but to
[52:48] minister
[52:49] right the greatest of all should be the
[52:51] servant of all amen so we should never
[52:53] ever want to want to tear each other
[52:56] down see unforgiveness is like an
[52:59] addiction
[53:00] like someone who smokes or drinks or on
[53:03] drugs they wreck their family eventually
[53:06] unforgiveness does the same thing
[53:07] there's no smoke coming out of any lips
[53:10] or any e-cigarette or any bottles or any
[53:12] any needles on the ground but yet is
[53:14] just as bad because the person can play
[53:17] the part look the right part be as holy
[53:19] as holy can be on the outside but if
[53:21] there's unforgiveness on the inside that
[53:23] will that will destroy that family it
[53:25] will destroy a church
[53:27] we must never ever pass our
[53:29] unforgiveness onto our children
[53:31] we must never ever let a bad attitude
[53:34] that we have towards someone be passed
[53:36] out onto our children because in our
[53:38] children it will be Amplified a hundred
[53:40] times remember with Elisha all those
[53:43] kids came out said go up bald head go up
[53:47] the reason I said that is because their
[53:48] parents were talking that against the
[53:50] prophet so their their annoyance or bad
[53:53] attitude towards the man of God was
[53:55] magnified in the kids
[53:57] and all those kids died
[53:59] so we never want to let unforgiveness
[54:01] come down into our children we must be
[54:04] very careful what we share with them he
[54:05] said well they're grown up no can they I
[54:07] don't think they can stand a lot of
[54:08] things that we are a bit older
[54:11] but we should never pass bad attitudes
[54:13] towards our family you know about
[54:15] someone else because they'll pick up our
[54:17] grudges they'll oh because we're family
[54:18] will stand together you've got to be
[54:19] careful what you stand with
[54:21] you know if there's if there's an idol
[54:23] of unforgiveness in the family you want
[54:25] to be like get in and cut that thing
[54:26] down you want to be standing alone in
[54:28] that family they're respecting the
[54:30] father and mother but you don't want to
[54:31] be worshiping that Idol
[54:33] why because it will bring destruction
[54:36] that's very important we there's no
[54:39] there should be no unforgiveness in our
[54:41] lives it should bother us if we have a
[54:44] grudge it should bother us if we think
[54:46] about someone and have an ill feeling
[54:47] that should bother us because we should
[54:50] be able to think about our worst enemy
[54:52] and just think love
[54:54] so you should be just say if I'm your
[54:56] best friend you don't need to wave or
[54:57] anything but just say just for arguments
[54:58] like if I was your best friend and you
[55:01] think about me that way praise the Lord
[55:02] then think about your enemies you should
[55:04] be able to think about us as the same
[55:06] because Divine love that's how we should
[55:08] be and if you are not feeling that way
[55:10] you should go to prayer
[55:12] because it's not your enemy or someone
[55:14] who's treated you wrong that's in the
[55:15] wrong it's you
[55:17] it's it's vital we get because I want to
[55:20] see the power of the spoken word in this
[55:22] church I want to see an eye an ice and
[55:25] sapphires again not people dying but
[55:27] just sin be spoken out that the devil
[55:30] has no place to work in our lives that
[55:33] he's Bound by a chain of circumstance
[55:35] that he cannot work in any of us right
[55:37] that's what I want to see the ninth
[55:39] spiritual gifts operating God is moving
[55:41] in power that's like man every Service
[55:43] is like Sunday night at Camp absolutely
[55:46] praise the lord we we can't put a roof
[55:48] on our faith or what God can do he's
[55:50] unlimited amen but our unforgiveness
[55:52] will stop him moving
[55:55] so I want him to move who wants to see
[55:57] Jesus
[55:58] Hallelujah that's what I want so
[56:01] praise God Amen so the Apostle Paul
[56:04] would say I'm crucified with Christ
[56:06] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[56:08] liveth in me and the life which I now
[56:10] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[56:12] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[56:14] himself for me so his faith was a
[56:17] genuine Faith because it was the faith
[56:18] of the Son of God notice it doesn't say
[56:21] faith in the Son of God no it was the
[56:22] son of God's own faith in him and that's
[56:24] genuine Faith because it's actually God
[56:26] puts his faith in you Hallelujah so that
[56:28] so this is see he see the life I now
[56:31] live he used to live a different kind of
[56:32] life I'm going to destroy those
[56:34] Christians and I'm gonna
[56:35] give me high priest give me some letters
[56:37] of authority I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
[56:39] gonna I'm gonna put them in prison I'm
[56:40] gonna make them return I'm gonna torture
[56:41] them see he lived a different kind of
[56:43] life by human faith and then God made
[56:46] him and he lived by the faith of the son
[56:47] of Gods amen so he didn't have a he
[56:49] didn't have a human Faith after the road
[56:52] to Damascus amen and we must have our
[56:55] own road to Damascus experience where
[56:57] the Lord speaks to us and gets us off
[56:59] our high horse and knocks us to the
[57:01] ground and say Lord who are you I'm
[57:03] Jesus whom you persecute Hallelujah
[57:07] praise God now
[57:10] forgiveness sets people free of Trials
[57:14] who wants to be stuck in a trial
[57:16] I'm glad some people didn't people
[57:18] didn't say Amen
[57:20] because no one wants to be in a trial
[57:21] but but
[57:23] unforgiveness keep can keep you on a
[57:25] trial now this is this is from The Book
[57:28] of Job this is job 42 5-10 it says job
[57:31] responding to the Lord I've heard of
[57:32] thee by the hearing of the ear but now
[57:34] my I see a thief wherefore I abhor
[57:38] myself repent and dust and Ashes and it
[57:41] was so that after the Lord had spoken
[57:42] these words unto job the Lord spoke unto
[57:45] elefaster temanite my wrath is kindled
[57:47] against thee and against thy two friends
[57:49] for ye have not spoken of me the thing
[57:51] that is right as my servant job saith so
[57:55] the Lord's been saying you've been lying
[57:56] about me to job you have not been
[57:59] telling the truth to job about me this
[58:02] is this is why I'm angry at you this is
[58:04] what the Lord's saying therefore take
[58:06] unto you now seven Bullocks and seven
[58:08] Rams and go to my servant job and offer
[58:10] up for yourselves a burnt offering and
[58:13] my servant job shall pray for you for
[58:15] whom will I accept lest I deal with you
[58:17] after your Folly and that ye have not
[58:19] spoken made the thing which is right
[58:21] like my servant job so now job has to do
[58:25] something you think about it his best
[58:27] friends have been spending I don't know
[58:28] how long telling him he's a secret
[58:30] sinner being very spiritual about it and
[58:33] basically giving him a warped idea of
[58:35] who God is
[58:37] right they've been lying to him
[58:39] and so now job has to actually pray for
[58:41] those people who are actually trying to
[58:42] basically destroy him
[58:47] so elephants are timonite and Bill Dad
[58:49] the shoe light and so far the name and I
[58:51] went and did according as the Lord
[58:53] commanded them the Lord also accepted
[58:55] job
[58:57] so these ones had to go to him and say
[58:59] the Lord's angry against us
[59:01] you have to pray for us
[59:03] now job could have just held that
[59:05] unforgiveness said well you've been
[59:06] lying to me all this time and my
[59:07] greatest trial you do not help me you're
[59:09] telling me I'm a secret Sinner and all
[59:11] these things and you've been lying to me
[59:12] about about God now I need to pray for
[59:14] you
[59:15] but job was a man of God because he had
[59:18] faith in the blood of the Lamb
[59:21] and he and the Lord accepted job because
[59:24] he could forgive he had to forgive his
[59:26] friends before he prayed for them
[59:29] right are you willing to do that
[59:31] oh but they did this and this and this
[59:33] against listen
[59:35] the nails in Jesus hands and feet did
[59:37] not hold them to the cross
[59:39] and also the Romans didn't put him there
[59:42] our sins put him there it wasn't the
[59:45] high priest it wasn't the Sanhedrin it
[59:46] wasn't the Romans it was our sin that
[59:49] drove him to Calvary
[59:50] and his love for us held him there till
[59:54] he died it wasn't the nails sure the
[59:56] Bible said they pierced my hands on my
[59:58] feet but it wasn't it was love
[1:00:00] that held him there
[1:00:02] Hallelujah
[1:00:04] so look so so if he could forgive us of
[1:00:06] all of our sin not just past but present
[1:00:09] and future and our iniquities and our
[1:00:12] secret faults and all if he can forgive
[1:00:14] us of all those things how can we hold a
[1:00:17] grudge against someone how can we hold
[1:00:19] resentment well this person did this to
[1:00:21] me but what did you do to the Lord the
[1:00:24] great king of glory you sent him to
[1:00:26] Calvary and yet will hold a little thing
[1:00:28] that really means nothing against
[1:00:30] someone and it will be just this big
[1:00:32] thing in our life and will live looking
[1:00:34] only through that we should be Looking
[1:00:35] Through The Eyes of the blood of Jesus
[1:00:37] Christ that's how we should be looking
[1:00:39] at all things before this person and
[1:00:41] they deserve that and they deserve this
[1:00:43] and while I knew that was coming to them
[1:00:44] you hypocrite that's wrong
[1:00:46] that is not that is not forgiving how
[1:00:49] can Faith work in your life if you hold
[1:00:51] things against one another well you say
[1:00:53] I'm not willing to forgive but I'm
[1:00:54] willing to walk with God if you're not
[1:00:56] willing to forgive you cannot walk with
[1:00:58] God it's really that straightforward
[1:01:00] you'll stay captive in your
[1:01:02] unforgiveness until you're willing to
[1:01:04] say Lord forgive them I forgive them
[1:01:06] Lord and because true forgiveness
[1:01:08] actually surrenders the right to hold it
[1:01:10] against someone
[1:01:12] now trust is a different thing trust is
[1:01:13] earned but forgiveness should be freely
[1:01:15] given
[1:01:16] right so we cannot hold anything against
[1:01:18] anyone doesn't matter how they treat you
[1:01:20] doesn't matter if they never change it's
[1:01:22] actually about you
[1:01:24] because your faith must be tried is it
[1:01:26] genuine Faith oh praise God at campus
[1:01:29] genuine holy the spirit's moving God's
[1:01:31] all no what about in everyday life what
[1:01:33] about when there's problems in the
[1:01:35] family extended family
[1:01:37] father Outlaws mother Outlaws whatever
[1:01:39] you know in-laws you know what about
[1:01:43] those things people that just won't
[1:01:45] reconcile with you what do you do about
[1:01:47] do you hold it against them
[1:01:49] you know some Wars have been fought so
[1:01:50] long people forgot why they started
[1:01:53] I doubt very much of the hundred year
[1:01:55] war against the French and the English
[1:01:56] they probably forgot what they're
[1:01:57] fighting about when it was about year 98
[1:01:59] they just well we're fighting this war
[1:02:00] this is what we've been doing for
[1:02:02] Generations forget what the past has
[1:02:04] done don't be dictated to by the
[1:02:06] previous generations this is a new
[1:02:07] season this is a new hour we should not
[1:02:10] be dredging up the past and trying to
[1:02:12] live through it it's like brother kydra
[1:02:14] said about the civil rights movement in
[1:02:15] America he says he didn't tell his kids
[1:02:17] about it because it just brings up those
[1:02:18] Spirits again that's my brother Cadre he
[1:02:21] said that although there's some wisdom
[1:02:22] in that
[1:02:23] why because we're pressing forward
[1:02:26] amen We're Not Looking Back Peter said
[1:02:28] forgetting the things which are behind
[1:02:29] press to the mark of the high quality
[1:02:32] but but I've been hurt by it sure you
[1:02:34] may have been hurt but forgiveness
[1:02:35] brings healing
[1:02:37] forgiveness brings healing
[1:02:39] praise the Lord and when the Lord heals
[1:02:41] someone it turns it from a pain to a
[1:02:43] victory
[1:02:44] who wants Victory then then forgive Let
[1:02:48] It Go
[1:02:49] but you know don't let unforgiveness be
[1:02:51] such a part of your identity you can't
[1:02:53] separate it from yourself for some
[1:02:55] people do there's grudges that still go
[1:02:57] on
[1:02:58] you know we should let it go we don't
[1:03:02] need to carry those things we don't need
[1:03:04] to be dragged down by the past just let
[1:03:06] it go
[1:03:07] let go of insecurity Let It Go
[1:03:10] Hallelujah just just let it all go
[1:03:14] and the Lord turned the Captivity of job
[1:03:17] when he prayed for his friends also the
[1:03:19] lord gave job twice as much as he had
[1:03:21] before
[1:03:22] so job's trial ended when he forgave his
[1:03:25] friends and prayed for them
[1:03:27] see how unforgiveness can keep someone
[1:03:29] captive
[1:03:31] they can be in their own high Max
[1:03:33] security
[1:03:34] facility in their mind
[1:03:36] because they're not willing to forgive
[1:03:40] who wants to be in prison
[1:03:43] that yet people make a prison for
[1:03:45] themselves it's not the devil that put
[1:03:46] them in that keeps them in the trial
[1:03:48] it's their own unforgiveness keeps them
[1:03:50] in the trial
[1:03:52] we don't want to be
[1:03:53] captive to unforgiveness
[1:03:57] what is it an eternity will you remember
[1:03:59] it
[1:04:00] will it be the big thing that's your
[1:04:01] identity over there it won't even be
[1:04:04] remembered
[1:04:05] so why not forget about it now why not
[1:04:07] put it under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:09] and walk on
[1:04:17] but if you forgive not many trespassers
[1:04:19] neither will your father forgive your
[1:04:20] trespasses
[1:04:22] I want to be forgiven I want to be set
[1:04:24] free I want to walk with God
[1:04:26] that's what he wants he wants that more
[1:04:29] than you want it
[1:04:31] so
[1:04:32] I say let's just let's just you say well
[1:04:35] I need prayer no no you need to talk to
[1:04:37] the Lord yourself
[1:04:38] and let it go it's you and God you're
[1:04:41] the one who forgives we can pray for you
[1:04:43] all day long anoint with buckets of oil
[1:04:45] but you've got to be the one that
[1:04:46] forgives and lets go of it
[1:04:49] but I've been holding on for this for so
[1:04:51] long let go
[1:04:52] may this be a new year
[1:04:54] where the things that would bother us in
[1:04:56] our mind and torment us because of
[1:04:57] unforgiveness in our Spirits last year
[1:04:58] might just be gone
[1:05:00] let's let's walk with God
[1:05:02] who wants to walk with him today
[1:05:05] Hallelujah I mean let's just let's just
[1:05:08] stand to our feet I know we've got some
[1:05:09] prayer requests and so on but
[1:05:12] let's just bow heads
[1:05:14] this evening
[1:05:16] Who Wants to Be Remembered in prayer say
[1:05:18] I want to I don't want any any
[1:05:20] unforgiveness I don't want any feelings
[1:05:22] I don't want no bad when I think of
[1:05:25] anyone in my life
[1:05:27] I want it all gone
[1:05:30] let's let's pray
[1:05:32] gracious father
[1:05:34] Dear God
[1:05:36] Lord Jesus as we come to you this night
[1:05:39] oh you're the great king of glory Lord
[1:05:41] Lord we can't hide anything from you
[1:05:43] Lord we may have a lot of reasoning why
[1:05:45] we hold on to unforgiveness but Lord you
[1:05:48] look through the reasoning Lord you look
[1:05:50] through it oh God and you say no that
[1:05:52] reason doesn't mean nothing it's because
