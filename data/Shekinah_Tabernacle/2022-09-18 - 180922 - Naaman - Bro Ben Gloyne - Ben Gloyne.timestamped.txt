[24:58] with us
[24:59] [Music]
[25:06] [Music]
[25:30] with love
[25:32] as I walk with the Heavenly done
[25:38] let me go all the while with a song and
[25:43] smile fill my way every day
[25:52] amen praise the Lord you can all take
[25:55] your seats here this morning
[25:58] amen so we have a few notices the first
[26:01] notices is that we have a youth service
[26:03] on this afternoon at 2 30 right here
[26:06] so we are looking forward to that I
[26:08] believe we have brother ketta who's
[26:10] going to be song leading
[26:12] and brother Jimmy is ministering in
[26:15] brother Dave is ministering so I believe
[26:18] we're in for a great time this afternoon
[26:20] amen
[26:22] now the other notice is
[26:25] is that on the Friday just
[26:28] path was brother Ben's last day at his
[26:32] job at the science lab
[26:36] [Applause]
[26:42] so as of I guess now he's
[26:47] um officially
[26:48] a
[26:50] full time with us
[26:55] and I think it's a significant occasion
[26:58] yeah
[27:00] and
[27:01] um I'm gonna get him to come up and just
[27:03] just speak a little bit about it but I
[27:06] just want to say something first before
[27:08] he does
[27:10] um because I think at the moment you
[27:12] know these are moments and and we're we
[27:14] are we are going to be blessed but we
[27:16] have also been a part of that moment
[27:17] that the fellowship here and striving
[27:19] for the work of the Lord
[27:21] you know we talked about it last night
[27:22] and we
[27:24] concluded that there's a lot of guys
[27:26] that can
[27:28] get a test tube and test wheeze
[27:32] you know there are many other guys and
[27:35] girls out there that can do that I don't
[27:37] want to make light of it but you know
[27:38] but someone that wants to actually
[27:40] dedicate their life to the ministry of
[27:42] the word of God
[27:44] the Bible says that the Harvest is great
[27:46] but the labor is a few and
[27:49] I think for someone that wants to do
[27:50] that
[27:51] I'm all for it I'm so happy that the
[27:54] kingdom of God can have us the Son of
[27:56] God that's a minister of God that wants
[27:58] to push the gospel of the Lord forward
[28:02] um
[28:03] and what I wanted to say about it was
[28:06] just that we we keep it in the right
[28:08] perspective of of our expectations
[28:11] because brother Ben knows that I'm sort
[28:13] of like I want to look after brother Ben
[28:14] and and I want to make sure that we all
[28:17] do as well you know and just because
[28:20] he's now full-time it doesn't mean that
[28:22] he's at our beck and call to to drain
[28:24] him of every last ounce of energy that
[28:26] he's got although I believe if you
[28:28] really need it you can go oh yes I
[28:30] understand but
[28:32] but you know we we want to
[28:34] make sure we look after him make sure we
[28:36] keep the
[28:37] the expectation correct like I've said
[28:39] to brother Ben and Sister Christine man
[28:41] on a well if it's a school day at three
[28:43] o'clock go down and pick the children up
[28:45] and go take them out for ice cream or
[28:46] something and have a good time don't
[28:48] don't burden yourself and be like feel
[28:50] like you've got to just I know if I see
[28:52] the president and I'm at the park with
[28:53] the children oh no are they going to
[28:55] think that I'm I should be working you
[28:57] know you know it's not like that it's
[28:59] like
[29:00] like if brother Ben is in a good place
[29:02] mentally that's right and he's in a good
[29:05] place spiritually that he's relaxed and
[29:07] he can actually enter into the presence
[29:08] of God
[29:09] and somebody comes up when he's in that
[29:11] atmosphere and he could minister to them
[29:13] or speak a word to them and they come
[29:14] around or something like that
[29:16] and it has a result because he's in the
[29:18] right frame of mind then how much is
[29:20] that worth if he if he relaxed all day
[29:23] with the children and got in a good
[29:24] frame of mind put it that way you know
[29:26] so it's not about it's he doesn't have
[29:27] to it's about making sure that he's in a
[29:30] good place that he can Minister the word
[29:31] of God and I think there's a scripture
[29:32] that says obey them that have the rule
[29:35] over you and submit yourselves
[29:37] for they watch for your souls as that as
[29:40] they that must give account that they
[29:42] may do it with joy and not with grief
[29:46] so I want to make sure that he can do it
[29:47] with joy we don't want to put this
[29:49] pressure on like I know Sister
[29:51] Christina's she likes it she doesn't
[29:52] like it she's not she's a giver she's
[29:54] not a taker so she wants to I think she
[29:56] feels like she she won't mind me saying
[29:58] this because I think it's a good
[29:59] attribute that she's a giver but I think
[30:01] she'll feel like oh no I can't go and
[30:03] Ben and I couldn't go down and pick the
[30:05] children up after school we've got to be
[30:06] working you know and but but we want to
[30:08] let her know that it's not like that you
[30:10] know you know we want you to be happy
[30:12] and relaxed and and enjoy be happy in
[30:16] yourself enjoy yourself like because
[30:18] because they've got the working for the
[30:21] kingdom of God is hard it's hard
[30:22] mentally sometimes you know you're you
[30:24] get in a place and you you as Paul said
[30:26] you know he's enlisted all the things
[30:28] that that all the hard things he went
[30:29] through and then he said on top of that
[30:31] the care of all the churches the weight
[30:33] that comes upon me is I have to have a
[30:35] burden for the the church now brother
[30:36] Ben has a burden for the church and that
[30:38] weight is upon him
[30:39] lets upon him whether he works a hundred
[30:42] hours a week or no hours a week that's
[30:43] upon him
[30:45] um and I one of my favorite scriptures
[30:46] is in Deuteronomy that says Thou shalt
[30:49] not muzzle the ox that treateth out the
[30:51] corn
[30:52] ER I really like that one you know that
[30:53] someone that labors let them eat let
[30:56] them have enjoyment don't just have this
[30:57] ox
[30:58] I like I love the goddess like that he
[31:01] he sees this oxus laboring and treating
[31:03] out the cornea saying if it wants to
[31:06] I put his mouth down and eat something
[31:08] don't stop it it's working hard you let
[31:11] it eat
[31:12] and Paul said you know do you think he's
[31:13] saying that for the the Oxford not
[31:15] really you're saying that for us you
[31:16] know that they that minister in the word
[31:18] of God should also be partakers but also
[31:20] there's another scripture
[31:21] that says let the elders that rule well
[31:23] be counterworthy of double honor
[31:25] especially they watch labor in the word
[31:28] and indoctrine
[31:29] for the scripture saith Thou shalt not
[31:32] muzzle the opposite treteth out the corn
[31:33] the laborer is worthy of his reward
[31:37] so so that's going to be our
[31:40] fellowship's thrust towards you is that
[31:41] we want you to be happy and don't feel
[31:44] pressured like now that you're full-time
[31:45] you've got to do all these things you
[31:47] don't you can just serve the Lord the
[31:49] bubble just be happy in the Lord and
[31:51] feel no pressure so that you can come
[31:52] here and be the spirit of God can flow
[31:54] through because that's what we're after
[31:55] and if whatever place that you need to
[31:57] be in to get that then you go there
[31:59] whatever that might be and we're
[32:01] confident in the Lord so I'd just like
[32:02] brother Ben just to come up because I
[32:04] think it's the moment so you come up and
[32:05] speak
[32:07] [Applause]
[32:15] foreign
[32:19] thank you brother Isaac appreciate that
[32:22] yeah love you all
[32:24] run this together
[32:26] let's take a Rapture
[32:27] that's why we're here I but lots of
[32:31] words actually
[32:32] it was weird walking out of work last
[32:33] time yeah it was great though last time
[32:36] I put my lab coat in the bin last time I
[32:40] did everything last time it was amazing
[32:42] but um you know it's actually it's funny
[32:43] how you said about anyone can do it
[32:45] anyone can do it but uh quite a few
[32:47] months ago we were watching one of the
[32:49] torchlighter series and there was a
[32:51] there's one there is cartoons about
[32:53] different testimonies of Believers
[32:55] Through the Ages and there's one about a
[32:57] uh some men they wanted to go contact
[32:59] some unreached tribes on the Amazon and
[33:01] they gave their lives in that but their
[33:04] wives actually took the gospel to these
[33:05] people but they were these young guys
[33:07] before they're married they're at
[33:08] University and one guy had a real burden
[33:10] of permissions he says look yeah yeah
[33:12] he's talking to this other guy who's
[33:13] being a lawyer or something training to
[33:14] be a lawyer he said you know anyone can
[33:16] do what you want to do but very few
[33:18] people are heeding the call for Missions
[33:20] and it kind of hit me like here
[33:22] you know because you know we're
[33:25] replaceable with anything but God's call
[33:27] is special yes and um yeah and then
[33:29] before we went to Canada I was thinking
[33:31] you know what am I doing here just keep
[33:32] coming in my mind and
[33:34] um yeah just praying about it and just
[33:36] felt you know like um when brother Abe
[33:38] Pana was here before covert
[33:41] um I met him before that time eight
[33:43] years before that and he was a teacher
[33:44] full-time but then when he came here to
[33:46] minister to us he was full-time in the
[33:47] ministry and I asked him what what
[33:50] happened I was expecting some big
[33:51] testimony you know God said do it and he
[33:54] said well there's a need and I could
[33:56] so that really come back in the way of
[33:58] my mind recently as well so
[34:00] you know I remember actually when we had
[34:02] our knife shop
[34:04] um I was in the back I was because
[34:06] things were difficult and I was praying
[34:08] said Lord what
[34:10] what should we do
[34:11] and he said to me I called you to preach
[34:13] the gospel
[34:14] so basically forget this thing not that
[34:17] we did but you know he's like because
[34:18] I'm about the shop he's no I called you
[34:20] to preach the gospel so it takes me a
[34:22] while to listen but eventually I get
[34:25] there
[34:25] so God bless you all love you so much
[34:28] and um I believe running in for good
[34:31] things you know let's see the dead in
[34:33] Christ race let's go home let's find
[34:36] every last one so we can go home so yeah
[34:38] God bless you thank you so much
[34:40] thank you
[34:50] amen this is Stan this morning and just

[48:41] place it's kind of like that with the
[48:42] word of God you think it's the same

[49:10] just a few verses here says now Naaman
[49:13] the captain of the host of the king of
[49:14] Syria was a great man with his master
[49:16] and honorable because by him the Lord
[49:19] had had given Deliverance unto Syria and
[49:21] he was also a mighty man in Valor but he
[49:24] was a leper and the syrians had gone out
[49:26] by companies that have brought away
[49:28] captive out of the land of Israel little
[49:30] maid and she waited on naaman's wife and
[49:33] she said unto her mistress would God my
[49:36] Lord were with the prophet that was in
[49:38] Samaria for he would recover him of his
[49:41] leprosy what a fake amen let's bow heads

[51:09] in Jesus Christ's name we want to submit
[51:11] Our Lives into your hands amen
[51:14] amen God bless your friends you may have
[51:15] your seats this morning
[51:17] um it was so I just uh I was kind of
[51:20] lost for words before but I had to it
[51:21] was weird to leave work because you kind
[51:23] of had to close a chapter of your life
[51:25] you know he had to kind of die to that
[51:26] kind of that's who I was that's not who
[51:28] I was so kind of mixed emotion but the
[51:30] Lord's good
[51:32] amen so we want to look into here Naaman
[51:35] being a leper
[51:38] it's amazing the um
[51:40] leprosy we know the Bible speaks of as a
[51:43] type of sin we know you know this is
[51:45] probably very Elementary to us all but I
[51:46] just want to go into this because you
[51:48] know it's amazing what can be happening
[51:49] in secret in our lives can affect our
[51:51] whole life and not just our life but the
[51:53] whole church you know it's amazing we're
[51:55] really you know we know Church troubles
[51:57] don't start in the church they start at
[51:58] home and they don't just start at home
[52:01] in the kitchen but they really start in
[52:02] the bedroom that's really where the
[52:04] biggest trouble is is is relations
[52:05] between husbands and wives can really
[52:07] stop the whole spirit of God flowing
[52:09] through that couple like it should you
[52:11] know where the Bible would say uh the
[52:13] Apostle Paul would say you know let the
[52:15] husband Render unto his wife do uh
[52:17] benevolence and likewise also the wife
[52:19] under her husband the wife hath no power
[52:21] over her own body but the husband and
[52:23] likewise also the husband has no power
[52:25] over his own body but the wife defraud
[52:27] you not one another accept it be consent
[52:29] for a time that you may give yourselves
[52:31] through fasting and prayer and come
[52:33] again uh come together again that's
[52:35] Satan tempt you not for your in uh con
[52:39] tend to I don't know how to even say
[52:41] that word inconsistency or something but
[52:43] you see he says here now don't defraud
[52:45] one another now that defrauding is not
[52:47] uh stealing money like committing uh uh
[52:51] you know monetary fraud but that fraud
[52:53] is actually an emotional withholding
[52:55] right because because the devil has
[52:57] taken the greatest uh sign of you know
[53:01] or the greatest act of love
[53:03] right we'll just say the word six okay
[53:05] because the devil wants to hide things
[53:07] under the carpet don't mention these
[53:09] things openly because he likes to keep
[53:10] it secret right so so the devil has has
[53:13] taken that
[53:14] and that was God's grass expression of
[53:16] love between a man and a woman and has
[53:18] totally destroyed it in this age and
[53:20] made it something that it is not at all
[53:22] but you see so so we don't want to look
[53:26] at it just as an act because the world
[53:27] just looks at as a pleasurable act but
[53:29] it's a spiritual act as well it's two
[53:31] coming not just two bodies coming
[53:32] together but but it's it's Body Spirit
[53:34] Soul coming together as one as a real
[53:37] Oneness so now what happens is is if
[53:40] there's a defrauding going on that that
[53:42] means there's actually a blockage
[53:43] between the that couple but the thing is
[53:46] what happens is like Neymar no doubt
[53:47] when the leprosy begin to set it and
[53:49] we'll come into that he would have
[53:50] tightened his armor up more he would
[53:52] have covered up more he would have been
[53:54] appeared more Pious in his
[53:56] station as a general but there was sin
[53:59] in his life he was trying to cover up so
[54:01] some people can try to appear more
[54:02] religious or more holy or more message
[54:04] whatever's tag you want to put in but
[54:06] they're just hiding something in them
[54:07] that needs to come out right so so here
[54:10] was you know so we don't want to so so
[54:12] the Apostle Paul says don't defraud one
[54:15] another
[54:17] there should be a bit of spice in life
[54:19] but put it that way you know it's not
[54:21] just to have children like yo Sarah said
[54:24] that hey yo Sarah said within her heart
[54:25] when the angel came and said you're
[54:27] gonna have the promised son she said
[54:29] will I have pleasure with my Lord again
[54:31] so it wasn't just to have the act of
[54:33] having a child actually no there's
[54:34] pleasure's all part of it
[54:36] yes right but it's not just two bodies
[54:38] coming together it is two people spirits
[54:41] Spirit soul and body connecting so it's
[54:43] not just an act the world has made it an
[54:45] act but don't don't let what they've
[54:47] done influence you yeah
[54:50] you know and then even in the world a
[54:52] lot of women or even men they'll
[54:54] withhold sex from their partner just to
[54:56] try and get leverage over them right
[54:57] that is a modern feministic idea yes
[55:00] don't let that Spirit come in and affect
[55:02] your marriage we should give ourselves
[55:04] because remember in a marriage just like
[55:06] with you and the Lord you put him above
[55:08] yourself
[55:09] right so you'll put his needs above your
[55:11] needs so we should put our spouse's
[55:13] needs above our own needs
[55:15] amen right there's a little bit
[55:16] different from the rest you know from
[55:18] from the meal in taranaki but hell yeah
[55:20] but you see but you see those things can
[55:22] affect the whole church so it's not just
[55:24] oh it's just between me and my wife or
[55:26] me and my husband no that'll affect the
[55:27] whole body because the spirit of God
[55:29] can't move through that family like he
[55:32] wants to because there's this problem
[55:35] but the thing is see we can be you know
[55:39] the greatest moment in our life should
[55:40] be our defining thing
[55:42] so if you're still in Egypt under
[55:44] slavery
[55:46] those Spirits tormenting you is what
[55:48] defines you right but then you come
[55:51] through the Red Sea and what defined as
[55:53] well at that point was the enemy was
[55:54] dead and they were free that was their
[55:56] defining moment right they were no
[55:58] longer defined by slavery they are now
[56:00] defined by freedom
[56:02] Hallelujah and then they went into the
[56:04] promised land so so Caleb taking his
[56:06] Mountain was what defined him it wasn't
[56:08] being a slave it wasn't the marks of the
[56:10] slave whips on his back the scars and
[56:12] the memories those did not hold them
[56:14] back but he got what he he wanted amen
[56:17] so what defined and remember we think of
[56:19] Caleb what do you think of Caleb no I
[56:20] think of give me my mountain and he got
[56:22] his mountain right that's what defined
[56:24] him so so it should be what defines us
[56:26] is we've met the Lord amen right so
[56:29] nothing of our power should influence
[56:31] our current state
[56:32] right those things are just a tormenting
[56:34] Spirit to try and hold us back there but
[56:37] we're not called to be held back there
[56:38] we're free indeed amen amen amen so so
[56:41] whatever you did in your past don't let
[56:43] that get in your way between your
[56:45] marriage
[56:45] right we're meant to be new people in
[56:47] Christ amen so
[56:49] amen that just came out that's kind of
[56:52] free but you know we're gonna we're
[56:53] gonna look at you know our lives affect
[56:54] everyone
[56:55] it's not just our family and things but
[56:57] naaman's whole life was name and secret
[56:59] that he was trying to manage affected
[57:01] the whole country it's amazing leprosy
[57:04] everyone knew uh leprosy it was a
[57:07] dreaded disease no one could no one had
[57:10] a cure you know they were you know
[57:12] anyone who got there proceed they just
[57:14] went to a leper colony whatever position
[57:16] they were in before they got leprosy did
[57:18] not matter when they got leprosy right
[57:20] so Naaman if God didn't intervene in his
[57:22] life he would have ended up in a leper
[57:23] colony and all he would have had is just
[57:25] a memory of being the captain of the
[57:27] host of Syria but that would not have
[57:29] defined him in the leper colony so
[57:31] Sinners a way of coming in right
[57:33] right sometimes you know many times we
[57:35] don't look for it but it finds us
[57:36] because the devil wants to try and Rob
[57:38] us of who we are in the Lord he wants to
[57:40] Rob us of our Victory and he just wants
[57:42] us to be fighting over something that's
[57:43] really nothing I mean that we can
[57:45] actually go to the Lord and get it
[57:47] eradicated out of our lives right so so
[57:49] we don't ever want to try and hold yo yo
[57:52] it's amazing when when even just natural
[57:54] sickness comes in we think we can manage
[57:55] it this is manageable you know no doubt
[57:58] maybe when when um you know when um
[58:01] Naaman first got the first spot on his
[58:03] hand or wherever it was he saw the
[58:04] leperous spot and no doubt all the
[58:06] emotion you know the wave of emotion
[58:07] would have come over him of you know the
[58:09] where where this is gonna take him but
[58:12] then he began to think it no doubt
[58:13] within himself but I can manage this
[58:15] that's not so bad you know and we've got
[58:18] to be very careful when things come into
[58:19] our lives you know we should know the
[58:21] spirit of God enough that when the enemy
[58:23] comes and we can identify him
[58:25] right when that when that when that real
[58:27] hard heaviness real you know that your
[58:30] spirit comes in and you feel it's wrong
[58:32] maybe I can't describe it very well but
[58:33] you know it's not God you know and the
[58:35] spirit of God comes as that sweetness is
[58:37] that love and your faith just raises and
[58:39] all you want to do is praise him and you
[58:40] love them and you love one another but
[58:42] then the enemy comes in as just as
[58:43] heaviness and unbelief and you know we
[58:46] should have a right
[58:47] in a prayer meeting or anywhere if the
[58:49] spirit's wrong to call a halt and say
[58:52] something's wrong here you know you know
[58:54] in Azusa Street there was a sister in
[58:56] those meetings that if a man stood up to
[58:58] preach and it was just it wasn't
[58:59] inspired by God she'd just stand up and
[59:01] say it's not inspired
[59:03] and she was right
[59:05] you say oh I don't know if we have the
[59:07] boldness for that kind of thing so maybe
[59:09] it's a bit radical but sometimes we've
[59:11] got to just go say hold on the spirit's
[59:13] not right you know and I'm not just
[59:14] talking about church but in our family
[59:16] if there's a real heaviness a real
[59:17] division a real you know a burdensome
[59:19] feeling going I said hold on something's
[59:21] not right here and we should we're
[59:23] called not to live under that kind of
[59:25] thing we should just go through the
[59:26] motion someone just starts spouting off
[59:28] unbelief and they'll never be free and
[59:30] that's not a testimony this is wrong and
[59:32] we should say hold on that's not how
[59:35] God's speaking now that is the devil
[59:37] speaking will not put up with us if
[59:38] you're going to notice separate between
[59:39] the person and the spirit
[59:41] right because many times we just go like
[59:43] this and we think it's the same thing
[59:45] it's not the same thing
[59:47] right so we should have a right to
[59:48] actually call the halt but the thing is
[59:50] if we're like Naaman we'll try and
[59:52] manage it but the reason he was trying
[59:53] to hide is because he didn't know there
[59:55] was a solution
[59:56] we have a bomb
[59:58] we have a bomb it's not made in China
[1:00:01] it's made in heaven amen it doesn't have
[1:00:04] an expiry date and it works on
[1:00:06] everything on external and internal
[1:00:09] wounds right it it works everywhere from
[1:00:12] head to toe everywhere
[1:00:15] that's the blood of our Lord Jesus
[1:00:16] Christ that is our bomb from Gilead amen
[1:00:19] so so Naaman he did not know the
[1:00:22] solution to his problem he thought well
[1:00:23] this is just where it's going to go but
[1:00:25] you know it's amazing you know brother
[1:00:26] Brown would say we are our best and our
[1:00:28] worst at home we can put on a mask we
[1:00:31] can put on a facade we can put on a good
[1:00:33] behavior when we're around other people
[1:00:35] but when we're at home it's when we
[1:00:37] really take the armor off we really let
[1:00:38] down our garter for the good and the bad
[1:00:40] so you know no doubt there was a time
[1:00:43] when the you know first spot may be
[1:00:44] formed in his hand and
[1:00:46] just like I was saying about issues in
[1:00:48] the bedroom you know there's a covering
[1:00:50] up to try and cover up soon
[1:00:52] maybe maybe no doubt you know he put his
[1:00:54] armor on more when he you know walked
[1:00:56] you know you know went out of the home
[1:00:57] maybe put on some more robes and you
[1:00:59] know it's amazing When sin comes into
[1:01:00] her life there's a distance that comes
[1:01:02] between people you know so because
[1:01:04] because he was carrying a secret and
[1:01:07] that secret actually made him live under
[1:01:09] a fear what if people find out
[1:01:12] what if what if what if one of my
[1:01:14] lieutenants and someone finds out I've
[1:01:16] got this I've got this leprosy my whole
[1:01:18] life is over my Prestige is gone my
[1:01:21] pride is gone who people think I am is
[1:01:23] gone because they're Who I Really Am is
[1:01:25] not who I really am to them because they
[1:01:27] think he's healthy strong he's in charge
[1:01:29] he's a general but here's a man with
[1:01:31] Leprosy trying to hide it and so here he
[1:01:35] was with this and yo so no doubt he
[1:01:37] would have you know become more distant
[1:01:38] from his men maybe people who are you
[1:01:41] know in his chain of command that maybe
[1:01:43] he'd eat with or whatever more he'd
[1:01:45] become more distant from them
[1:01:46] and maybe they'll think well he's just
[1:01:48] maybe more Pious than he was before
[1:01:51] he's really reached another plane and
[1:01:53] the message I tell you he's just he's
[1:01:54] just really well that third pull is gone
[1:01:56] something but no it wasn't but it wasn't
[1:01:58] that but it was dressed up like that
[1:02:01] but I was a sin he was trying to hide
[1:02:03] because he is afraid if someone found
[1:02:05] out a secret you know I'm so glad we
[1:02:07] don't have to carry leprosy
[1:02:10] I'm so glad we don't have to be
[1:02:12] spiritually sick we can be spiritually
[1:02:14] healthy strong and well all the time we
[1:02:16] can have such an immune system because
[1:02:18] the devil wants to put things on us but
[1:02:19] we don't have to own it right we are
[1:02:21] sure identified but we're going to
[1:02:22] realize that the spirit within us has
[1:02:24] already overcome that thing whatever it
[1:02:26] is right amen so now here he is he's
[1:02:28] trying to you know he's trying to hold
[1:02:31] you know hide things away but you know
[1:02:32] there comes a time when all things are
[1:02:34] exposed there Comes A Time you know you
[1:02:37] can delay it you can make it quick you
[1:02:38] know but but but to live in that time of
[1:02:40] torment and fear and worry why live
[1:02:43] through it amen why why let it pre you
[1:02:46] know why let it continue on when you can
[1:02:47] just get rid of it get rid of it from
[1:02:49] the very get-go
[1:02:51] you know there are other kinds of
[1:02:54] leprosy too another form well I mean I
[1:02:56] mean I mean a source of it right Miriam
[1:02:58] would be struck down by leprosy because
[1:03:00] she made fun of Moses
[1:03:01] you know and she made fun of Moses
[1:03:03] because because he married the Ethiopian
[1:03:05] girl
[1:03:06] but the problem is she got so caught up
[1:03:09] in his Humanity because remember Miriam
[1:03:11] was older than Moses Miriam followed
[1:03:13] Moses in the in the ark and the bull
[1:03:15] rushes you know would have helped raise
[1:03:17] him would have changed his diapers would
[1:03:19] have fed him a bottle I'll just bring it
[1:03:20] to modern terms you know would have
[1:03:22] changed him would have bath them would
[1:03:24] have got anointed him when he spat food
[1:03:25] at her face and trying to figure you
[1:03:27] know so so she saw him grow up so she
[1:03:30] became so familiar with his Humanity
[1:03:33] that when it was God speaking through
[1:03:35] him or God actually manifesting
[1:03:37] something because remember because Moses
[1:03:39] was a type of God even even God's hidden
[1:03:42] you be God to the people Moses will be
[1:03:44] your Prophet so his actions were
[1:03:46] actually manifesting what God did so he
[1:03:48] took a gentile bride because all Christ
[1:03:49] types in the Bible take a gentile broke
[1:03:52] right there pointing to you and the Lord
[1:03:54] right so so he was actually acting out
[1:03:56] Redemption yeah
[1:03:57] but but because because she was so
[1:04:00] caught up in Moses Humanity she thought
[1:04:02] there's the foolish thing and made fun
[1:04:04] of it so we're going to be very careful
[1:04:06] that we don't get too common with one
[1:04:09] another that when God speaks we actually
[1:04:12] think it's just that that person and
[1:04:14] pride puts up a wall and we miss what
[1:04:16] God's doing and what could actually
[1:04:17] happen sin can come into our lives
[1:04:19] because we don't accept what God is
[1:04:21] trying to say to us because of the
[1:04:23] vessel that it's coming through I'm not
[1:04:25] just talking about people who stand
[1:04:26] behind the pulpit but talk about Justin
[1:04:28] Fellowship you're going to be able to
[1:04:29] differentiate is that God or is that or
[1:04:32] is that the person now if you're full of
[1:04:34] Pride you'll just say it's the person
[1:04:36] but you should take it on board don't
[1:04:39] just don't just bat it away take it on
[1:04:41] board think about it yes yes because it
[1:04:43] may be God trying to get your attention
[1:04:44] about something
[1:04:46] so Miriam would get leprosy because she
[1:04:48] got caught up in Moses Humanity when he
[1:04:51] was acting out he was foreshadowing
[1:04:53] Redemption for us so let's not let's not
[1:04:56] let ourselves get too common in that way
[1:04:58] that when God speaks we just say you
[1:05:00] know it's them because that's just
[1:05:02] carnal Pride we don't want to be like
[1:05:04] that
[1:05:04] so
[1:05:06] it wasn't really knowing back in those
[1:05:09] days how leprosy was transmitted that's
[1:05:11] why they're putting a leper colony now
[1:05:14] aren't you glad that we had a prophet
[1:05:16] stand in this day and he'd say Sinner's
[1:05:19] not drinking sin is not adultery
[1:05:21] Sinner's not lying or swearing or
[1:05:23] cheating or sin is not those things sin
[1:05:25] is unbelief so Malachi 4 stood in this
[1:05:28] generation to actually tell you this is
[1:05:30] what leprosy really is this is how it's
[1:05:32] transmitted its unbelief comes into a
[1:05:35] person's life right and then it
[1:05:37] manifests leprosy right because leprosy
[1:05:40] I think it's a bacteria or something so
[1:05:42] it's not even a you know it's something
[1:05:44] you can't even see with your eye right
[1:05:46] that's why but that's why he gave a
[1:05:47] special microscope to diagnose viruses
[1:05:50] that's the same thing we had a set of
[1:05:52] eyes come in this generation
[1:05:54] brother Branch here I'm standing in Two
[1:05:56] Worlds he can see the Eternal and he can
[1:05:58] see right now that's why he could say
[1:06:00] look I'm looking at you 40 years ago
[1:06:02] this happened you know because he's
[1:06:03] standing in Two Worlds so he had a set
[1:06:05] of eyes that could look beyond our
[1:06:06] natural sight so the same thing with sin
[1:06:08] he could look beyond the natural
[1:06:10] and say no no you got to go further
[1:06:12] you're not looking at it right yeah
[1:06:14] yeah leprosy is sin or sin is unbelief
[1:06:17] that's how it's transmitted so unbelief
[1:06:19] comes in
[1:06:20] pain comes in complex comes in whatever
[1:06:23] it is remember it's a bruised cell in
[1:06:25] our spirit that the devil wants to work
[1:06:28] through
[1:06:29] right so and it can be an insecurity yes
[1:06:32] yes right it can be it can be it can be
[1:06:35] Pride
[1:06:36] it can be we get we we compare ourselves
[1:06:38] with ourselves carnally I'm better that
[1:06:41] my family's better than your family my
[1:06:43] dad's bigger than your dad kind of
[1:06:45] mentality you know when you're young my
[1:06:47] dad can beat up your dad or my uncles
[1:06:48] are bigger than your uncle so you know
[1:06:50] but but you bring that into the
[1:06:51] spiritual level people say well I'm glad
[1:06:54] my family's not like that family
[1:06:56] well my family's not like that how do
[1:06:58] you know you know you've got to be very
[1:07:00] careful that you don't stand in that
[1:07:01] judgment seat right because what they're
[1:07:03] going through you should get 10 times
[1:07:04] worse yes and with a religious Pride
[1:07:06] you'll never go and dip in the Jordan to
[1:07:08] get what you need because remember the
[1:07:10] manifestation of especially the wife is
[1:07:12] actually the condition of the Father's
[1:07:14] Heart the husband's heart is manifested
[1:07:16] in the wife right so because remember
[1:07:19] brother Brown preached a sermon is your
[1:07:20] life worthy of the Gospel he did not say
[1:07:22] is your wife worthy of the Gospel he
[1:07:24] never said that but people have taken
[1:07:26] that condition because brother M says
[1:07:28] well the woman types the church so you
[1:07:29] better line up because if you're not
[1:07:31] lined up people will think that we're
[1:07:32] not lined up and but it's just actually
[1:07:34] problem in the husband is manifested in
[1:07:37] the family
[1:07:38] right that doesn't mean children will
[1:07:40] not go away with so on and not saying
[1:07:42] that but you know there's a
[1:07:43] manifestation what's going on here isn't
[1:07:46] there
[1:07:47] right so we got to be real
[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:07:51] uh we're gonna look at ourselves
[1:07:55] right and say you know am I in my
[1:07:57] position because the greater position
[1:07:59] you get into the more surrender it takes
[1:08:01] to get there
[1:08:02] the more remember Jesus sure he came to
[1:08:04] the Jordan he was baptized right Jordan
[1:08:06] is a death to self but then his final
[1:08:09] act before he went to Calvary is he had
[1:08:10] to say Lord not my will but thy will be
[1:08:12] done
[1:08:13] so he had to have a death in Gethsemane
[1:08:16] to go to Calvary I remember Calvary the
[1:08:19] death Resurrection was the greatest
[1:08:20] manifestation of his ministry that was
[1:08:22] the reason he was there right he wasn't
[1:08:25] just there to heal the sick race he did
[1:08:26] have power over nature he demonstrated
[1:08:28] all those things to say this is what a
[1:08:30] redeemed son does everything Adam lost
[1:08:33] Jesus manifested amen right and so
[1:08:36] everything that Adam lost was he lost
[1:08:38] perfect fellowship with God perfect one
[1:08:40] with Oneness with God he lost eternal
[1:08:42] life and he lost Dominion
[1:08:44] over this earth right and then so now
[1:08:47] brother bam says when when the lamb
[1:08:49] takes the book he redeems us back to
[1:08:51] everything that Adam lost he says now
[1:08:53] this and the Sevenfold book of seals of
[1:08:55] redemption that lamb took within himself
[1:08:57] the only one who could do it he took it
[1:08:59] from the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:09:00] the throne now the claim his redempted
[1:09:02] to claim his rights to claim for you and
[1:09:04] me what he redeemed us from to see back
[1:09:07] to everything that Adam Lost In the
[1:09:09] Garden of Eden he redeemed us back to
[1:09:11] that
[1:09:12] amen now with the Lamb with the book in
[1:09:15] his hands we are ready to ask his grace
[1:09:17] and mercy upon us to open the seven seal
[1:09:19] book to us and to let us look past the
[1:09:21] curtain of time to me it was astounding
[1:09:23] he tied those two things together he has
[1:09:25] opened the book
[1:09:26] and he has let us look past the curtain
[1:09:28] a tongue
[1:09:29] that's why the Holy Ghost gets off the
[1:09:31] the word gets a hold of Our Lives
[1:09:32] actually showing because that's him and
[1:09:33] getting a hold of you and that's
[1:09:35] actually giving you sight there's a
[1:09:36] lamby on the river you've got a body
[1:09:38] Over Yonder wait we got a father Over
[1:09:40] Yonder Hallelujah it actually reveals
[1:09:43] you that this is not your final
[1:09:45] destination you're going there
[1:09:48] so he so so everything Adam lost has
[1:09:50] been now restored to us right we're not
[1:09:52] waiting for it to come it's not coming
[1:09:54] we're not tracking tracking the package
[1:09:57] coming on our phones right we're not
[1:09:59] looking where is it what Depot is it you
[1:10:01] know what church has messenger has got
[1:10:03] it where is it no it's here right it's
[1:10:05] been coming to the seventh age messenger
[1:10:06] now it's now it's here right so so now
[1:10:09] the word restores this fact a perfect
[1:10:11] Oneness with God and to me that's not
[1:10:13] just with God that should be with your
[1:10:15] spouse amen right because the
[1:10:16] manifestation of Oneness is is sure it's
[1:10:19] here but it comes out here yes right so
[1:10:21] so the relationship you have with God is
[1:10:23] manifested in the race if you have with
[1:10:25] your family yeah
[1:10:26] and with one another because by this
[1:10:28] shall all men know your my disciples
[1:10:30] because you love have one love one for
[1:10:31] another amen right so so there should be
[1:10:34] a manifestation of that Oneness
[1:10:37] this way because it's this way yes yes
[1:10:39] right so so he so so he's so we have so
[1:10:43] Adam he so so so Adam he lost perfect
[1:10:46] one's Oneness with God and his wife
[1:10:49] eternal life and Dominion but God has
[1:10:51] restored all those things to us amen so
[1:10:54] that's why it's so vitally important to
[1:10:57] realize that and if you do not have
[1:11:00] perfect Oneness
[1:11:03] or Dominion United overcoming power in
[1:11:06] your life he said Lord what are you
[1:11:08] trying to show me
[1:11:09] because he wants to take us higher
[1:11:10] that's why he allows trials to come into
[1:11:12] our life wants to take us higher right
[1:11:14] are we all together
[1:11:16] okay I hope this is here we are I don't
[1:11:19] know if this is a chili burger or what
[1:11:20] but this is oh well this is where we are
[1:11:23] right so you so we need to look at the
[1:11:26] see Naaman Naaman When sin came into his
[1:11:29] life he thought he could manage it
[1:11:32] and it just made him distant from his
[1:11:34] from his family made him distant from
[1:11:36] his men because he was trying to appear
[1:11:39] more separated and Pious now because
[1:11:41] we're springing to religious terms right
[1:11:43] he's trying to look more Sanctified but
[1:11:46] really he was hiding a secret
[1:11:48] and that was because he was afraid that
[1:11:51] the people would find out and he would
[1:11:53] be had to go to a leper colony
[1:11:56] you know
[1:11:58] it takes see
[1:12:00] the thing is that people
[1:12:03] if we if we have a plan B in life
[1:12:06] we we won't meet the Lord
[1:12:09] if you have a plan B yes you won't meet
[1:12:12] the Lord that's right Simon the Sorcerer
[1:12:14] one of the Holy ghosts to further his
[1:12:17] former life because he used to sell
[1:12:19] potions they considered him a man of God
[1:12:21] and in Samaria right and then so Peter
[1:12:23] comes along lays hands upon the people
[1:12:25] receives the holy ghost that says Simon
[1:12:26] went got baptized joined the church was
[1:12:29] a Believer saying praise the Lord but he
[1:12:30] says how can I get this and he saw that
[1:12:34] whatever wasn't working so he said to
[1:12:36] Peter can I give you money then
[1:12:38] it seems like I'm praying but nothing's
[1:12:40] happening so can I just give you money
[1:12:41] for this because I got money and then
[1:12:43] Simon says no there's iniquity in your
[1:12:44] heart that's why you have not received
[1:12:47] the Holy Ghost yet
[1:12:49] because he was wanting to take that
[1:12:51] because his motive of receiving it was
[1:12:53] to use it for his former to to further
[1:12:55] his former life he wasn't willing to die
[1:12:57] to what he was just like the Rich Young
[1:12:59] Ruler he loved his identity was in his
[1:13:02] was in his money it wasn't actually in
[1:13:04] the law
[1:13:06] because if he was sincerely just
[1:13:07] following God because he says look I've
[1:13:09] kept these Commandments I've done all
[1:13:10] this so it looks like his sincerity was
[1:13:13] all wrapped up in that being a good
[1:13:15] message believer but the problem is
[1:13:16] actually his identity wasn't wrapped up
[1:13:18] in that it was wrapped up in his money
[1:13:20] right
[1:13:21] and that's why he wasn't willing to let
[1:13:23] that go
[1:13:25] oh hello yes so we can't have plan B
[1:13:28] see the good thing about naming is he
[1:13:30] didn't have a plan B
[1:13:32] he didn't have a plan B he only had one
[1:13:34] plan amen right and it's got to be the
[1:13:36] same with us we're going to realize it's
[1:13:37] it it's Christ or nothing I'd rather
[1:13:40] take him but the thing is see the devil
[1:13:42] loves to be carried around
[1:13:45] he's like not not you know he's like a
[1:13:48] he's just like something that literally
[1:13:50] wants to be on your shoulder and control
[1:13:51] your life you know and he wants to be
[1:13:54] protected
[1:13:55] he wants us to be his stronghold he
[1:13:57] wants us to protect them and to and to
[1:13:59] explain why he's there you know he will
[1:14:02] give us all the reasons Under the Sun
[1:14:03] why sin is ruling our life he will give
[1:14:06] us all the reasons why but really we
[1:14:08] should say well hold on why is this
[1:14:09] thing governing me
[1:14:10] I'm sick of this guy amen but if you
[1:14:13] love him if you have any kind of
[1:14:14] positive feelings towards sin or
[1:14:16] whatever you used to be you'll never be
[1:14:17] free of it because that's like like
[1:14:19] chains that hold them to you but if you
[1:14:22] really hate him he's gone if you're
[1:14:24] really getting sick and tired of sick
[1:14:25] and tired of why am I not getting it or
[1:14:27] why am I stuck why is this if you really
[1:14:29] get sick of that and identify the thing
[1:14:31] I'm sick of this thing holding me back
[1:14:33] then you can be free but if you love the
[1:14:35] thing if you say no this is who I am
[1:14:36] well that's who you'll be but I'm so
[1:14:38] glad that this is not a place just to
[1:14:40] stay who we were let's go higher on the
[1:14:42] Lord let's get more of him let's become
[1:14:44] more like him every day we shouldn't
[1:14:46] just sit back and say well I'm just I've
[1:14:48] always been this way Moses was a
[1:14:49] backslin prophet for 80 years yeah I
[1:14:53] don't think we have any 80 year olds
[1:14:54] here
[1:14:55] but he was in that condition for a very
[1:14:58] long time and and he he actually thought
[1:15:01] this is just this is who I am I'm a
[1:15:03] shepherd on the back side of the desert
[1:15:04] I've got this high-tempered wife and
[1:15:06] this is just how it's going to be the
[1:15:07] reason that was that way is because God
[1:15:09] had to mold him because he was out of
[1:15:10] his position
[1:15:12] right because when when he really came
[1:15:14] into his office then he would have to
[1:15:16] deal with those kind of things on a big
[1:15:18] scale yeah
[1:15:19] so God was actually using it remember
[1:15:21] everything in life is God's agent
[1:15:24] if you can't identify it as God's agent
[1:15:27] then you'll get frustrated
[1:15:28] and you get annoyed at God and people
[1:15:30] are not surrendered to God get angry at
[1:15:31] God but if you're really surrendered to
[1:15:33] God that's a good sign to know you've
[1:15:35] actually sold out is that whatever you
[1:15:36] go through in life you just love him you
[1:15:39] don't get frustrated and angry yo you
[1:15:40] say Lord this is your will for my life
[1:15:42] you know what I need praise the Lord
[1:15:44] amen hallelujah my path is different to
[1:15:47] someone else's path but hey praise God
[1:15:49] you're taking me through
[1:15:50] hey man so we could just race to that
[1:15:52] but you see see he so so he was he was
[1:15:54] that backslin Prophet for 80 years but
[1:15:57] then God called him maybe he thought
[1:15:59] well this is just he got really used to
[1:16:01] where he would take the sheep in
[1:16:02] different seasons
[1:16:03] he had 40 years in Midian to do it he
[1:16:05] got really used to how it worked
[1:16:07] season after season Time After Time well
[1:16:10] it's it's this time whatever month we go
[1:16:12] here we go there he got used to that
[1:16:14] going through the motions while we're
[1:16:15] having camp in October let's go to camp
[1:16:17] and shout and then we come back well
[1:16:19] there's Christmas coming up we're gonna
[1:16:20] go here for Christmas and this is gonna
[1:16:22] go on but you know sure but we should
[1:16:25] just get caught up in well that's just
[1:16:26] how life is going to be
[1:16:29] we can have all of that routine but then
[1:16:31] God can live in power in that routine
[1:16:34] amen right Hallelujah see but he was out
[1:16:37] he he just thought of yo here's a man
[1:16:39] who God said you're going to be God to
[1:16:40] the people
[1:16:41] and he was just happy with just being a
[1:16:44] shepherd on the back side of the desert
[1:16:45] out of his position
[1:16:49] praise the Lord but you see when God
[1:16:51] spoke to him then that was it yeah so we
[1:16:53] can't get into a point where I would say
[1:16:55] well this is just how I'm going to be
[1:16:56] because this is how I've always been no
[1:16:58] God's God God God God's a change maker
[1:17:01] amen he brings change he wants his
[1:17:04] change in our lives not our own change
[1:17:05] amen amen we may get in a real real you
[1:17:08] know people who can get comfortable in
[1:17:10] complaining
[1:17:11] yeah making it comfortable in trouble
[1:17:13] they're not happy unless there's trouble
[1:17:15] I've seen people Believers not in this
[1:17:17] country but you know they get they're
[1:17:19] only happy when there's trouble
[1:17:21] they are only happy when their husband
[1:17:23] is down or their wife is up down or
[1:17:25] whatever but when they're doing good now
[1:17:27] they're unhappy
[1:17:28] because they're used to living in that
[1:17:30] kind of a way
[1:17:32] that is not our ordained position
[1:17:34] we are not called to live in that kind
[1:17:36] of way where it's only trouble makes us
[1:17:38] happy no peace and joy and love and the
[1:17:41] Holy Ghost should make us happy we
[1:17:43] should be happy when our family's doing
[1:17:44] happy we should be happy when the church
[1:17:46] is doing happy we should be happy when
[1:17:47] we we hear of some believer in the back
[1:17:49] of Mozambique somewhere meets the Lord
[1:17:51] we should be so happy because that's
[1:17:52] part of the body just like us you know
[1:17:55] so but so we should not be happy when
[1:17:57] there's only if you're happy just
[1:17:59] because there's drama you need to change
[1:18:01] where your happiness Lays
[1:18:03] but we can just get so caught up in that
[1:18:05] but because we people identify with that
[1:18:08] Spirit then they say this is me
[1:18:11] but if they really hate that then they
[1:18:12] can be free right so so we don't want to
[1:18:14] have a plan B
[1:18:16] we never want to have a plan B
[1:18:18] so here comes Naaman he is compensating
[1:18:21] for his leprosy but then like any any
[1:18:23] Senate comes out eventually it can be 40
[1:18:25] years it can be two minutes it can be
[1:18:27] however long but it'll come out in its
[1:18:30] season What's Done in secret will be
[1:18:32] broadcast to the world
[1:18:34] right but the thing is we think when we
[1:18:36] first when the devil gives us a bit
[1:18:39] when that first spot strikes our life we
[1:18:42] think we can manage this this is really
[1:18:44] not that bad surely would have been a
[1:18:45] great shot come over naaman's face when
[1:18:47] he saw that first spot on his hand
[1:18:49] wherever it was he thought I can cover
[1:18:50] this up
[1:18:51] this is fine he goes out of the bathroom
[1:18:54] goes out to the kitchen wherever or
[1:18:56] wherever his wife is how you doing honey
[1:18:57] just fine
[1:18:58] he's got leprosy
[1:19:01] he's got trouble
[1:19:02] right
[1:19:04] and the more we cover up the more
[1:19:07] distant we can come from everyone yet
[1:19:09] yet with the same quotes you know the
[1:19:11] same armor on right
[1:19:13] right but it's when you take the armor
[1:19:14] off see what we are at home is really
[1:19:16] Who We Are Who We Are by ourselves is
[1:19:18] who we are really we can be one thing to
[1:19:20] you know we can be many things to many
[1:19:22] people but who you are alone is who you
[1:19:24] are
[1:19:25] yeah really so Naaman when he was all
[1:19:27] alone all he could see was leprosy now
[1:19:30] it's amazing that that that his servant
[1:19:32] girl you think about this
[1:19:35] she she would be living with her
[1:19:37] captives uh cap girls rather the ones
[1:19:40] who took her captive she lived with she
[1:19:42] served them the ones that ripped her
[1:19:44] from her family at a young age the ones
[1:19:47] who brought trauma and pain into her
[1:19:48] life she was living with
[1:19:50] now don't you think it would have been
[1:19:52] really the because Israel was eye for an
[1:19:55] eye tooth for a tooth or if we just take
[1:19:57] it into our language they deserve it
[1:20:00] you know there's there's a Revenge
[1:20:02] spirit in this country oh yes that that
[1:20:05] person deserves that oh that's that's
[1:20:06] Karma you know they deserve that yeah
[1:20:08] and so not that we believe in karma here
[1:20:10] we know right reap what you say all
[1:20:12] those things it's a scripture principle
[1:20:14] perverted right right but the thing is
[1:20:16] she could have thought well this he
[1:20:19] shouldn't have done that he deserves
[1:20:20] this because look what he's done to my
[1:20:22] people look what he's done to me I'll
[1:20:24] never see my parents again I'll never be
[1:20:25] in my happy little home again but there
[1:20:27] was something within her because when
[1:20:29] she how she was raised and how she saw
[1:20:32] the prophet of God operate in Israel she
[1:20:34] knew nothing was impossible with God
[1:20:35] Amen she was born under that kind of
[1:20:38] Supernatural atmosphere where she saw
[1:20:40] that God could do anything remember up
[1:20:43] to that stage there was no case of
[1:20:44] lepers he had ever been healed that was
[1:20:47] a hundred percent
[1:20:48] fatality or mortality whatever rate 100
[1:20:50] percent
[1:20:51] statistically had never been done before
[1:20:53] but then she just cried out oh I wish to
[1:20:56] God that my Lord was there in Israel
[1:20:58] with the prophet of God and that Prophet
[1:21:00] would make him well
[1:21:02] and what an incredible thing
[1:21:04] to reveal the source of Deliverance to a
[1:21:07] people that are oppressing you
[1:21:09] isn't that incredible you know because
[1:21:11] they were they made her do mean things
[1:21:13] you know that yo clean this go here do
[1:21:15] this get up now yo her life was not her
[1:21:18] own
[1:21:19] and she could have lived just with the
[1:21:21] with the with the thought of a lost
[1:21:23] childhood and a lost family in the what
[1:21:25] could have been of life
[1:21:26] but she she Rose above that amen
[1:21:29] Amen to actually give give Naaman her
[1:21:32] own Master a source of deliver these
[1:21:34] Source the only source in the whole
[1:21:36] world
[1:21:37] of of Deliverance
[1:21:40] Hallelujah amen so she so she could you
[1:21:44] know she cried that out and you know
[1:21:47] it's amazing they actually listened to
[1:21:48] what she had to say
[1:21:49] he was a servant girl and really they
[1:21:52] you know normally well back in those
[1:21:54] days it it is said today but not
[1:21:56] outwardly they'd say our God is greater
[1:21:58] than your God that's why we conquered
[1:22:00] you our God gave us Victor over your God
[1:22:02] and so they could have thought oh this
[1:22:03] Hebrew God's nothing because look we are
[1:22:05] we are invading their country we're
[1:22:07] taking them captive but but there would
[1:22:09] have been such an atmosphere around that
[1:22:10] little girl
[1:22:12] we've got to be careful that we don't
[1:22:13] just ignore what our children say to us
[1:22:15] that's right God can step into a body
[1:22:17] yes and speak a word yeah it can be this
[1:22:20] big yes we're gonna be we're gonna be
[1:22:22] quite sensitive where did that come from
[1:22:25] it can be out of the mouth of babes
[1:22:28] the work can come
[1:22:30] they might not even be aware of what
[1:22:31] they're saying that's right
[1:22:33] and so she said this and then it so
[1:22:35] moved them they you know they listened
[1:22:37] to what and they said hey we've got to
[1:22:38] write a king I mean we're going to go to
[1:22:40] the king of Syria to get him to write to
[1:22:41] the king of Israel to to get this all
[1:22:44] arranged so you see from with Naaman is
[1:22:46] is he was living under a different kind
[1:22:48] of atmosphere it wasn't a supernatural
[1:22:49] atmosphere and brother Brown says there
[1:22:51] are so many voices this is what really
[1:22:53] sparked this a few weeks back he says
[1:22:55] there's so many voices on the earth in
[1:22:57] the Earth today
[1:22:59] that
[1:23:01] um he says there's so many voices in the
[1:23:02] Earth today that are absolutely it's
[1:23:04] absolutely a hard thing because it
[1:23:06] deadens the voice of the supernatural
[1:23:07] there's so many intellectual voices
[1:23:10] great voices of mighty men who are
[1:23:11] intellectual at their own intellectual
[1:23:13] conditions can even Shake Nations
[1:23:14] they're just not overnight people but
[1:23:17] they Shake Nations bringing great
[1:23:18] organizations together great campaigns
[1:23:20] flowery and a person can be a little bit
[1:23:22] confused it's enough to confuse them of
[1:23:25] how that these things can go on and
[1:23:26] prosper and there's voices that raise up
[1:23:28] and do these things and it causes the
[1:23:30] voice of God to be played way back
[1:23:32] somewhere the true voice of God so in
[1:23:35] other words it says it makes the voice
[1:23:36] of God become background noise
[1:23:39] the supernatural voice of God where God
[1:23:42] can come in and speak directly to you
[1:23:44] you can be listening to a message he's
[1:23:47] listening to a song you'll be hearing
[1:23:48] preaching and the supernatural voice of
[1:23:50] God can come in and speak directly to
[1:23:51] your life see we're gonna or he can just
[1:23:54] put it in your heart
[1:23:55] I don't like that I don't want to do
[1:23:57] that I don't want you to do that anymore
[1:23:59] this doesn't please me that's a super
[1:24:01] let's see it's more than just a voice
[1:24:03] see the supernatural voice of God guides
[1:24:05] our steps
[1:24:06] should do right that we shouldn't be led
[1:24:09] by our own carnal understanding but God
[1:24:11] should direct our steps I remember when
[1:24:13] I became a a few years ago now but but I
[1:24:16] just became a new Christian just met the
[1:24:17] Lord and I was going to a um going to a
[1:24:20] youth camp there down in Christchurch
[1:24:21] and and I had to get the money out to
[1:24:23] pay for the fees and so I was at Uni and
[1:24:26] and there were two ATMs on campus one
[1:24:28] was right by what used to be me be my
[1:24:31] favorite Pub before I got delivered to
[1:24:33] that Spirit of alcohol and the other one
[1:24:34] was on the other side of Campus so I
[1:24:36] went to the one on the other side of
[1:24:37] campus and it was on a Thursday night or
[1:24:40] some night where where that Pub Ebon was
[1:24:42] there because I wasn't there because I
[1:24:44] got set free but so I went to this ATM
[1:24:46] that was far away from it but it was out
[1:24:48] of order so I said well I'll go to the
[1:24:49] one right by the pub store just to get
[1:24:51] the money and I went around these
[1:24:52] buildings and these trees that were
[1:24:53] blocking the noise the music from the
[1:24:55] place and as soon as I went around past
[1:24:57] there and I heard the noise of it
[1:24:59] the Lord spoke in my heart said he said
[1:25:01] I don't want to go there
[1:25:03] he didn't even say you don't want to go
[1:25:05] there he says I don't want to go there
[1:25:07] so I didn't get the money out there
[1:25:10] but you see there are places where God
[1:25:12] likes he doesn't like to go
[1:25:14] and we should be sent to it no we
[1:25:16] shouldn't be living in fear Lord is this
[1:25:17] pleasing or not no just just be
[1:25:18] surrender to him he'll guide your steps
[1:25:20] we can rest in his leadership I trust
[1:25:22] you can right but there's places he
[1:25:24] doesn't like and places he likes
[1:25:26] so we should be sensitive to those
[1:25:27] things so so Naaman was not sensitive of
[1:25:30] those cards thanks for the never been in
[1:25:31] that kind of atmosphere so he was still
[1:25:34] operating in a political idea and he
[1:25:36] says well I'm the I'm the general of
[1:25:38] Sirius I'll get my king to write to
[1:25:39] their King because that's the Diplomatic
[1:25:41] channels that I'm used to that's the way
[1:25:42] I'm used to being you know you're
[1:25:43] dealing with you know like the Queen's
[1:25:45] funeral you know
[1:25:47] the yeah the royal family doesn't just
[1:25:49] come and sit with everyone well everyone
[1:25:51] doesn't sit with a royal family you know
[1:25:52] there's certain places where there you
[1:25:54] know there's hierarchy where people sit
[1:25:56] in different things and you know with
[1:25:57] the ceremonies and the funeral and you
[1:25:59] know where they sit in the chapel and
[1:26:00] different things they don't just walk in
[1:26:01] the front door and find a seat
[1:26:03] you know and and not everyone can just
[1:26:05] approach them there's different
[1:26:06] hierarchies they're normally you know
[1:26:07] different leaders will speak to
[1:26:08] different leaders on the same level if
[1:26:10] it's a very important Summit it's the
[1:26:12] presidents of countries will speak it's
[1:26:15] not just some Deputy foreign minister of
[1:26:17] or some minister of some you know thing
[1:26:19] that's not related to what they're
[1:26:20] talking about will come and speak to the
[1:26:22] president of that country they'll feel
[1:26:23] it offended say this is an important
[1:26:25] this is an important Summit why are you
[1:26:27] sending this Lackey this guy just came
[1:26:29] out of Diplomatic School right you know
[1:26:31] surely if this is important to you you
[1:26:33] come yourself
[1:26:34] this is how neyman was used to operating
[1:26:36] so so that's why he went to the king of
[1:26:38] Syria the king of Syria wrote the letter
[1:26:39] and then and then he sent it to the king
[1:26:41] of Israel and then the king of Israel
[1:26:43] because he he is blinded to the
[1:26:45] supernatural himself he just rents his
[1:26:47] clothes and say oh my God that I can
[1:26:49] heal this person can I really do this
[1:26:51] he's just trying to pick a fight with me
[1:26:52] he was caught we we must never get
[1:26:55] caught up in this kind of thinking yeah
[1:26:57] just a political well this is our church
[1:27:00] goes and this is this and you know
[1:27:02] natural carnal thinking yeah right I
[1:27:04] hope that's not too vague but you know
[1:27:06] we shouldn't be we shouldn't be caught
[1:27:07] up in those kind of things we should
[1:27:08] always have a spiritual mindset yes why
[1:27:10] would you be thinking spiritually that
[1:27:12] God can come upon the scene and help
[1:27:13] right so be because of the king of
[1:27:15] Israel really knew what he had in his
[1:27:17] land he would have never just rented his
[1:27:19] clothes say this is just the king of
[1:27:21] Syria wanting to fight me no actually
[1:27:23] hold on I know the man
[1:27:25] who knows Jehovah God and he can he can
[1:27:28] he can speak and he can make him well so
[1:27:31] so rents is closed but then Elisha heard
[1:27:34] what the king of Israel had done now
[1:27:37] it's amazing name and up to this point
[1:27:38] he's had to expose his secret
[1:27:41] he's hidden it for so long but when he
[1:27:42] goes to the king says I've got leprosy
[1:27:44] his whole Secret's exposed
[1:27:47] by just exposing the Secret's not enough
[1:27:50] you got to get you you got to dip yeah
[1:27:52] man you got to go to God's provided
[1:27:54] place and get liberated
[1:27:57] because some people say well I've done
[1:27:58] enough no no have you been changed yet
[1:28:01] have the spots gone have you actually
[1:28:03] prayed through have you actually
[1:28:05] surrendered it at all because your
[1:28:07] brother around preaches so much about
[1:28:08] the doors within a door speaking of the
[1:28:10] heart yes and there's the private life
[1:28:12] he says you know people say you better
[1:28:13] not middle in there preacher that's my
[1:28:15] own private life but Jesus wants to go
[1:28:17] in there he doesn't just want to come in
[1:28:19] the front door as Savior and then that's
[1:28:21] it all right he wants to he wants to go
[1:28:23] through the whole house and if he wants
[1:28:25] to renovate the whole house amen if the
[1:28:27] Australian team said Lord is this color
[1:28:29] right on the wall does that painting
[1:28:30] really work there there's really that
[1:28:32] hobby really match what you are does it
[1:28:34] really can I really identify as a
[1:28:36] Believer when I do those things right
[1:28:38] and then if you still have a bit of
[1:28:40] Pride that you'll say no you can sit
[1:28:42] there you can have a biscuit don't come
[1:28:43] any further but if you're really
[1:28:44] surrender to him you say Lord you can
[1:28:46] renovate my whole house
[1:28:49] and and I and I trust that's our hearts
[1:28:51] desire right whatever things that we
[1:28:54] hold so dear are we willing to give
[1:28:56] those things to him
[1:28:59] I trust we are today
[1:29:01] amen so the king of Israel went his
[1:29:03] clothes he's a little upset thinking
[1:29:04] there's a fight that's gonna you know
[1:29:05] he's basically in his mind preparing for
[1:29:07] war and then and then Elisha sends to
[1:29:10] the king you know bring him here
[1:29:12] and then so here comes Naaman he brings
[1:29:15] all this gold and different things to
[1:29:17] pay for this and it comes No Doubt with
[1:29:19] many men around him because here's the
[1:29:21] general
[1:29:22] he doesn't drive his own car no no you
[1:29:25] know he's in the back someone's
[1:29:26] chauffeuring him so someone's driving
[1:29:27] The Chariot he's in the back and this
[1:29:29] trumpeters and his banners and all kinds
[1:29:31] of pump going on because Here Comes
[1:29:32] Damon but he's a leper
[1:29:35] but in his pride he thinks he's still
[1:29:36] something he thinks he's something but
[1:29:39] he's nothing oh amen right and when we
[1:29:41] get to that point where we realize
[1:29:42] actually we're not something the Lord is
[1:29:44] everything will it come humbly to our
[1:29:46] god right we can't come say well I've
[1:29:48] got something to give you God you should
[1:29:50] be you should appreciate that I've I've
[1:29:52] come to surrender my life that's not how
[1:29:53] it works God is not a respecter of
[1:29:56] persons amen so here comes Damon and
[1:29:59] then he comes to the prophet's house no
[1:30:01] doubt he's expecting in his mind some
[1:30:02] diplomatic group to welcome him and
[1:30:05] there'll be ceremonial speeches if we're
[1:30:07] so happy Damon that you're here in our
[1:30:09] country and you've heard our God is real
[1:30:10] and we're under expectation you'll be
[1:30:12] healed and different priests stand up
[1:30:13] and they give their little five minute
[1:30:15] little sermonette and different things
[1:30:17] and you know gifts exchange and let's
[1:30:20] play what he's expecting
[1:30:21] But Here Comes the guy out the front
[1:30:23] door and some common ropes
[1:30:26] and he's just a servant of the prophet
[1:30:29] and he says go dip in the Jordan seven
[1:30:31] times
[1:30:34] that made the Bible says that so so
[1:30:38] Caesar and second Kings uh five and ten
[1:30:40] and Elisha went sent a messenger onto
[1:30:43] him saying go and wash in the Jordan
[1:30:45] seven times and thy flesh shall come to
[1:30:47] thee uh come again to thee and thou
[1:30:49] shall be clean
[1:30:51] now you would think that a man would
[1:30:54] just say okay I'll go do that
[1:30:56] but you see this guy's a message
[1:30:59] believer
[1:31:01] he he's got a station in the church he's
[1:31:04] got an office in the church he's been
[1:31:05] there a long time they've won a lot of
[1:31:07] Victories as Believers because he's been
[1:31:10] there
[1:31:11] they've won a lot of Victories right
[1:31:13] God's been moving yeah
[1:31:15] but then because he's got the sin in his
[1:31:17] life see we've got to be willing to
[1:31:18] actually lay aside what people think of
[1:31:19] us we're gonna link to lay it aside not
[1:31:22] just say but I'm this person no no don't
[1:31:24] worry about that amen leprosy needs to
[1:31:27] be cleansed right sin's got to be dealt
[1:31:30] with
[1:31:31] and then so Naaman wasn't leaping for
[1:31:33] joy
[1:31:34] then he's Yo Daddy was told just go
[1:31:36] dipping the Jordan seven times he says
[1:31:39] and Naaman was rough
[1:31:40] and he went away and said behold I
[1:31:43] thought he would surely come out to me
[1:31:44] and stand and call him the name of his
[1:31:46] God and strike his hands over the place
[1:31:48] and recover the leper so he had in his
[1:31:51] mind this is how God's gonna do it and
[1:31:53] how many times we go to God In Prayer in
[1:31:55] our mind knowing how God's going to
[1:31:57] answer
[1:31:58] you know we already have in our mind
[1:31:59] well God you can do it this way and God
[1:32:00] says no I'm not going to do it your way
[1:32:02] amen I'm gonna do it when you're in
[1:32:04] condition for it to happen when you come
[1:32:06] to the point where you're ready for the
[1:32:08] miracle to happen that you don't say I
[1:32:09] prayed and this happened take us many
[1:32:12] times we can go to God expecting a
[1:32:13] testimony because we want to be
[1:32:14] associated with the testimony but
[1:32:16] actually all of our testimonies are his
[1:32:18] testimony right it's not our testimony
[1:32:20] my brother Adam said about when the
[1:32:22] pillar fire came down on the Ohio River
[1:32:24] he says I was just there when he came
[1:32:25] down
[1:32:26] that was his attitude towards the whole
[1:32:28] thing he says I was just there when he
[1:32:29] came down yeah so it wasn't I was in the
[1:32:31] river and this happened and then God you
[1:32:33] know God no he said I was just there
[1:32:34] when it happened
[1:32:35] you know it should be the same thing
[1:32:37] with us well what happened there well I
[1:32:39] was just there and he did that you know
[1:32:40] it wasn't anything I did really it's
[1:32:42] just he what he wanted to do man so he
[1:32:45] went away Roth
[1:32:46] and then he even went away because he
[1:32:49] began to compare Rivers
[1:32:52] well this church is better than that
[1:32:54] church
[1:32:54] oh this message really isn't we got a
[1:32:57] better movement Christian Movement out
[1:32:59] in the world
[1:33:00] yeah he's saying that the rivers of
[1:33:01] Damascus were better than the one of
[1:33:03] Jordan you mean this muddy thing
[1:33:05] this muddy thing you could never put it
[1:33:08] on a postcard we've got way better
[1:33:09] Rivers Where We Are
[1:33:10] but in his country there was no God that
[1:33:13] could heal there was no God that could
[1:33:15] clear celebrity they had all the form
[1:33:18] all the temples everything they had they
[1:33:20] had all the doctrine but no power and
[1:33:22] their God to heal and so so you know but
[1:33:26] he was getting mad so he got rough and
[1:33:28] he actually drove away in a rage it says
[1:33:31] in in chapter 12. it's not Maddie got he
[1:33:34] wasn't just upset
[1:33:35] or even you know in a bit of disbelief
[1:33:39] saying I didn't know it would happen
[1:33:40] this way he got mad
[1:33:42] at how many times
[1:33:45] do we get angry at the very word that
[1:33:49] gives us instruction to be free
[1:33:52] because of pride
[1:33:54] even though we know all the quotes know
[1:33:56] how it all goes together
[1:33:57] he gets provided away we can
[1:34:00] When God Says
[1:34:02] just give it to me
[1:34:04] just actually surrender it you don't
[1:34:07] have to hold on to this anymore it's
[1:34:09] actually quite easy look and live
[1:34:11] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ don't
[1:34:12] know the house shall be saved amen you
[1:34:14] know there's actually you can be free of
[1:34:16] this but he went away in a rage
[1:34:19] now as he's speeding down the motorway
[1:34:22] in his religious rage maybe having one
[1:34:26] of the messages blow you know the
[1:34:28] prophet blasting in his ears
[1:34:30] whatever servants catches up with him
[1:34:32] and says hold on oh great name and live
[1:34:34] forever
[1:34:35] maybe the servants are thinking this
[1:34:37] guy's ridiculous
[1:34:38] what he's doing is not even making
[1:34:40] logical sense he's come all the way to
[1:34:43] get the answer the answer's been given
[1:34:44] to him and he won't even take the answer
[1:34:46] that doesn't make that doesn't make
[1:34:47] logical sense you know if neyman could
[1:34:49] just get himself out of the situation
[1:34:51] and look at it for what it was he'd
[1:34:52] think that goes crazy to go away in a
[1:34:54] reach and sometimes we're going to
[1:34:56] really look at a situation get ourselves
[1:34:57] out of it then we can see it clearly
[1:34:59] right but our own Humanity blinds us to
[1:35:01] really the way we should take because
[1:35:03] we're in it but if you actually take the
[1:35:04] same variables the same scenario but
[1:35:07] take yourself out of it you'd give
[1:35:09] yourself most of the time speaking to
[1:35:11] myself to totally different answer to if
[1:35:13] you're actually in it because there's
[1:35:15] the eyes taken out
[1:35:17] right so so his servant would come to
[1:35:20] say surely if there wasn't surely if the
[1:35:22] prophet gave you a hard thing to do
[1:35:24] wouldn't have you done it
[1:35:25] they really begin to think yes that's
[1:35:29] true and as rage begin to subside
[1:35:32] and then he goes to the Jordan
[1:35:35] and now God knows how to get rid of all
[1:35:37] of our Prestige he knows how to get rid
[1:35:39] of all of our pride amen he knows how to
[1:35:41] get rid of all of what we think we are
[1:35:43] for him to step on the sink see there's
[1:35:46] a problem in this day this is a day of
[1:35:47] people's rights
[1:35:48] so we we think we have a right to be
[1:35:51] angry we have a right to hold something
[1:35:53] against someone we have a right to to to
[1:35:56] put up a wall against someone or not
[1:35:58] forgive some web rights but brother says
[1:36:00] we're sheep we give we forfeit our
[1:36:03] rights maybe as a person you have a
[1:36:05] right to hold grudges but as a Christian
[1:36:07] you do not you don't right or maybe you
[1:36:09] have a right to hold something you're
[1:36:11] passed against yourself even as a person
[1:36:13] short but as a Christian you don't you
[1:36:15] don't have that right we give up all of
[1:36:17] our rights amen hey man wait wait
[1:36:20] forfeit remember true forgiveness really
[1:36:22] is when you actually surrender the right
[1:36:23] to hold that thing against that person
[1:36:25] that's when you really forgive when you
[1:36:27] actually surrender that right to hold it
[1:36:28] against them
[1:36:30] yeah right because we say oh we forgive
[1:36:32] but
[1:36:33] hold on Is that real forgiveness or is
[1:36:36] that just words coming out of our mouth
[1:36:37] because we've been taught that way
[1:36:39] right we've got to have a real we really
[1:36:41] forgive
[1:36:43] we surrender the right to hold it
[1:36:45] against them
[1:36:46] but they did this
[1:36:49] um our sin made Jesus go to Calvary
[1:36:52] we did that to him what did he do to us
[1:36:54] what has he done to us as being bad
[1:36:58] not one thing my Jesus has never never
[1:37:01] done anything but religion has done bad
[1:37:02] things but Jesus is not religion that's
[1:37:05] right our lord Jesus is not religion
[1:37:07] right so so we think here but this
[1:37:10] person did this I'm going to treat them
[1:37:11] this way we were his enemy and he went
[1:37:13] to Calvary for us right he conquered
[1:37:15] hell death in the grave for you and I he
[1:37:17] didn't do it for himself he did it for
[1:37:18] you yes right so if he did that for us
[1:37:20] I'm sure we can we can actually give
[1:37:23] over the right to hold something else
[1:37:24] against someone
[1:37:27] so here Here Comes Damon
[1:37:30] he comes in his chair it comes by the
[1:37:32] Jordan it's real money that time of year
[1:37:34] he knows how to make it uncomfortable
[1:37:35] there's no nice little pool there where
[1:37:38] it's all clear and nice no it's a muddy
[1:37:40] because God knows how to get rid of our
[1:37:42] Prestige and then so he takes him there
[1:37:45] and maybe his heart sinks and says oh do
[1:37:48] I really have to
[1:37:50] and his servant says seven times
[1:37:52] seven times because they believe what
[1:37:55] the prophet said
[1:37:56] right they believe what the prophet said
[1:37:58] that's right and then so he rolls up as
[1:38:01] takes off his shoes
[1:38:02] maybe takes off his best vest I don't
[1:38:04] know and because it tipped onto the
[1:38:06] muddy Jordan and he because I feel the
[1:38:08] mud come between his toes baby steps in
[1:38:11] some oxygen weed and you know all those
[1:38:12] things and you know he's like oh what am
[1:38:14] I doing here but if he could just see
[1:38:16] what's going to happen
[1:38:18] sometimes we get prayer or we go through
[1:38:20] something and we're just so caught up in
[1:38:21] the moment of the what we need to do we
[1:38:24] kind of Miss what we're going to go get
[1:38:25] yeah
[1:38:26] you know and then so he goes into the
[1:38:28] Jordan and it's icy cold shaking
[1:38:31] shivering all those men are watching he
[1:38:33] goes down once
[1:38:35] he feels the same well that didn't work
[1:38:37] what's the point but then the servant
[1:38:39] said six more times
[1:38:41] and no doubt the servant that would have
[1:38:42] said that would have been the one he
[1:38:43] told to do the most
[1:38:45] God knows how to turn everything on its
[1:38:47] head to get rid of our pride he knows
[1:38:49] how to do it yes and then so he dips
[1:38:52] still the same he goes again but then as
[1:38:55] he's dipping his pride
[1:38:58] and is what he thinks he is his Persona
[1:39:01] his position herself just washes away
[1:39:04] and he now surrenders he now surrenders
[1:39:07] to God's provided way
[1:39:09] Hallelujah and that's how we're going to
[1:39:12] be God says just give it up come unto me
[1:39:14] all ye that labor I'll give you rest
[1:39:16] you know give to me your sin you
[1:39:18] shouldn't you don't need to be on drugs
[1:39:19] to be happy you know you don't need to
[1:39:21] be on some substance or living in a
[1:39:23] fantasy world reading books of just some
[1:39:25] fantasy romance or something and living
[1:39:27] in some other way come unto me amen amen
[1:39:29] you don't have to live a different way
[1:39:30] come unto me you don't have to live with
[1:39:32] that pain come to me I'll take it from
[1:39:33] you
[1:39:34] you know and then he goes down the sixth
[1:39:36] he goes down the seventh time
[1:39:38] and he comes back up
[1:39:41] and then he hears a different kind of
[1:39:42] response from the bank
[1:39:44] no doubt they begin to shout hallelujah
[1:39:47] all right we're gonna shout when God
[1:39:49] does something and he's a look at his
[1:39:51] hands and looks he says all the leprosy
[1:39:53] is gone
[1:39:54] Hallelujah so finally show his PR his
[1:39:57] pride went for the lepers he went amen
[1:39:59] so he could Now put on the same armor
[1:40:01] amen he could now not have a distance
[1:40:03] between his fellow Brethren anymore or
[1:40:06] his family he went back totally restored
[1:40:09] Hallelujah it should be the same thing
[1:40:11] with you and I there's water there's
[1:40:13] there's a water of the word we can dip
[1:40:14] into this morning that can take all
[1:40:17] anxiety all torment all pain all sorrow
[1:40:21] all whatever it may be all Pride God can
[1:40:24] take it from us if we're willing to
[1:40:26] Humble ourselves and say Lord
[1:40:28] yeah it cleans me a lot
[1:40:30] hallelujah hallelujah and then he went
[1:40:34] after that he went back to the prophet
[1:40:36] and and and and the prophet wouldn't
[1:40:38] take money because we know God yeah
[1:40:40] that's not how it works you don't buy a
[1:40:41] miracle yeah yeah right but then he says
[1:40:43] can I have some Earth
[1:40:45] so that I can take back
[1:40:47] and I can you know I you know I can
[1:40:49] worship there he says even forgive me
[1:40:51] this but I'm gonna when I go back I'm
[1:40:53] gonna go to the house of my you know the
[1:40:55] god there because the king leans on my
[1:40:57] arm when we worship imagine that
[1:41:00] going to a temple
[1:41:03] the king actually holds the hand of a
[1:41:05] man that that God they're bowing to
[1:41:07] could not could not heal
[1:41:09] think about that they go back into that
[1:41:11] Temple you go read it they go back into
[1:41:12] the temple the king holds his hand as
[1:41:15] they worship no doubt they bow and they
[1:41:17] hear the priests say how great this God
[1:41:18] is but they both know that God can do
[1:41:20] what just happened
[1:41:22] Hallelujah it should be the same thing
[1:41:24] with you and I people think oh
[1:41:26] everything's so great but where's the
[1:41:28] power of God
[1:41:29] where's the power of God in the word
[1:41:31] because we live in a time where the Holy
[1:41:34] Ghost has been released without measure
[1:41:36] I mean there's no creases no Darkness
[1:41:38] there's nothing that can hold him back
[1:41:39] in this hour he's been brother man says
[1:41:42] the end time message releases the Holy
[1:41:43] Ghost upon the people where this word
[1:41:46] has restored us back to a true Pentecost
[1:41:48] back to an indwelling of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:50] and the people where that holy spirit of
[1:41:52] God that comes within us has the power
[1:41:54] to cleanse us from all leprosy to
[1:41:56] cleanse a small complexes all trouble
[1:41:58] there's not nothing too hard for God
[1:42:01] that we cannot be delivered from amen
[1:42:04] hallelujah believe you so I'm just gonna
[1:42:07] leave it with that because I I'm I'm
[1:42:09] dead sure
[1:42:10] there's nothing too hard for our God
[1:42:14] yeah but if we
[1:42:22] if we're with it give all your money to
[1:42:24] the poor take up your cross and follow
[1:42:25] me
[1:42:26] yes I'm so glad to do that is that all I
[1:42:28] have
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:34] I don't know
[1:42:35] but the thing is because his identity
[1:42:37] was so wrapped up in it and the devil
[1:42:39] said you can't give that up what will
[1:42:40] people think of you
[1:42:41] Naaman had to come to a point
[1:42:43] because no doubt that would have crossed
[1:42:45] his mind when he saw the leprosy what
[1:42:47] are people going to think of me now
[1:42:49] but he had to be willing to go beyond
[1:42:51] that
[1:42:52] for the sake of himself and his marriage
[1:42:54] and his family all these things he had
[1:42:55] to go beyond that but then also to
[1:42:57] follow the instructions of the word to
[1:42:59] get washed
[1:43:01] so what a so what are what are you
[1:43:03] holding on to
[1:43:05] yeah I trust it's him
[1:43:07] not not not some hobby or something you
[1:43:10] just do in secret
[1:43:12] right what are you wrapped up
[1:43:15] amen Our God I believe
[1:43:17] we have a water
[1:43:19] we have a place we can dip into into the
[1:43:22] spirit of God and be cleansed from
[1:43:24] anything amen amen I am I'm I believe it
[1:43:28] so I asked you the question this morning
