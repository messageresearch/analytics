[20:45] with your testimony something that the
[20:48] Lord has done for you in the last little
[20:51] while that you would like to share with
[20:54] the
[20:56] congregation come brother
[21:14] Morning Saints morning uh this is a a
[21:16] very small story but it's just how good
[21:19] God really is and how he helps you it's
[21:21] it's something absolutely to the normal
[21:23] human he'll just think silly but it
[21:26] mattered to me so I was working
[21:28] and uh I work on the roads and it's it's
[21:30] always heavy equipment that we're
[21:32] working with and we've got this trailer
[21:34] and it's got a they call it a wacker
[21:36] just beats the ground up and down it's
[21:38] just all it is it's a wacker it's whack
[21:40] stuff and but it's heavy it's absolutely
[21:43] very very heavy and the one Foreman
[21:46] tells me to go to the the trailer take
[21:49] this whack and just throw it on the
[21:50] truck now the trucks are pretty high and
[21:53] I thought oh Lord you know my my back's
[21:56] not feeling too strong today you know
[21:57] you know when when you know it's not I'm
[21:59] not comfortable in my body so I walk
[22:01] into this um trailer and I'm standing
[22:04] inside there and the thought comes to
[22:06] mind just pray about it I I'll just pray
[22:08] and ask him to help me because if I hurt
[22:11] my back I can't work if I don't work I
[22:12] don't get paid it's just how it is you
[22:14] know so I walk into the trailer now I'm
[22:16] standing there and most of the people
[22:18] that that I work with is is is not
[22:21] Believers so they won't understand what
[22:23] I'm going through but I'm standing in
[22:24] the trailer by the way be known to
[22:26] myself and I take my helmet off and I
[22:28] take my beanie off and I just start
[22:30] praying I said Lord I know I'm not going
[22:32] to do it but I need to get this thing on
[22:35] there and get to the site where I need
[22:36] to be just help me and as I pray someone
[22:39] walks into the the box guard and it's a
[22:43] it's absolutely a young man very nice
[22:46] and he walks in as I'm praying so I get
[22:48] startled because you know you're praying
[22:50] but I just hear that because the thing
[22:51] is a bit unstable and I just stable and
[22:53] I look at this guy and he goes are you
[22:54] all right I said yeah I was just pray
[22:57] cuz that's what I was doing and he goes
[22:59] oh okay cool I said yeah cuz I need to
[23:01] lift this thing up there and it's heavy
[23:03] and I just don't have the power to do it
[23:05] today you know and he goes no I'll help
[23:07] you and I'll lift it up and I said yeah
[23:08] praise the Lord he send me you and and
[23:11] then a half an hour later he comes to me
[23:14] and he says when he was a teenager he
[23:16] lost his
[23:17] religion which which was kind of very
[23:20] sore but it was one moment where he
[23:22] could open up and I said but you don't
[23:24] need to lose it you know cuz you never
[23:26] lost it in the first place you just need
[23:28] to find it again you know you just need
[23:30] to find him and that's all I had to say
[23:32] but see that whole situation but known
[23:34] to myself was for him amen you know so
[23:37] praise the Lord so if you need to pray
[23:39] if you feel you need to pray pray that's
[23:42] right you never know what God's doing
[23:43] you never know so yeah just praise the
[23:45] Lord amen thank
[23:47] you praise the
[23:49] [Applause]
[23:56] Lord
[24:03] for our friends that are streaming
[24:14] in you don't have
[24:18] to be strong in the Lord and in the
[24:20] power of His
[24:24] might praise
[24:26] God
[24:31] hey man I'm so bad at giving testimonies
[24:33] see this is what you
[24:36] get He Man pure not only that I'm really
[24:40] nervous cuz when Andy said that I was
[24:43] like oh I had something on my heart but
[24:45] man it's hard
[24:46] day so okay if it's going to help
[24:50] someone amen cuz it's help
[24:52] me you have to bear with me
[24:56] though that's why I give okay if anyone
[24:58] doesn't know me I actually have happy
[25:00] tears and if I didn't have tears my head
[25:02] would pop off
[25:04] so it's better to see tears than to see
[25:07] what's in my
[25:10] head okay well so um okay I did share it
[25:14] with a few people um anyway so the
[25:18] supernatural uh subconscious Series has
[25:22] been such a
[25:23] blessing
[25:25] um now Andy shared whole lot when he
[25:28] gave that um when he gave the series and
[25:33] sometimes you know you there's so much
[25:34] you can't really take it all in because
[25:36] it's man it's
[25:37] overwhelming but it was interesting
[25:39] because it opened up a door when you
[25:41] when you say Lord I I don't actually
[25:43] know what I need which I don't um but
[25:46] when there's stuff in your subconscious
[25:48] that you grow up with that happen to you
[25:51] um you can just say it it actually gives
[25:53] you a doorway a door to open and so you
[25:57] can say which I did Lord I'm just I'm
[26:00] I'm really a dumb sheep you know I go
[26:03] and nibble the grass and then I want the
[26:05] grass inside the other padic you know
[26:06] and I don't actually know what I need
[26:08] and I don't know what's happened to me
[26:09] in the past so I don't know how to fix
[26:11] it and I don't know what it is so if
[26:13] there is anything which you I didn't
[26:15] even know there was if there is anything
[26:18] show me and then fix it what you did so
[26:22] um so I'll just give a little testimony
[26:26] um uh one night um and this is not my
[26:31] character I got really
[26:34] jealous okay I'm not competitive Isaac
[26:37] just doesn't like me because I'm not
[26:38] competitive we'll play a game and I'll
[26:40] just let him win you know and it really
[26:41] irks him I'm not competitive I don't get
[26:45] angry I certainly don't get jealous and
[26:47] I have never gotten jealous in my entire
[26:49] life um and I got really jealous one
[26:54] night and that made me angry I got
[26:56] jealous over eyes and I don't get
[26:58] jealous over people and um and I was
[27:01] basing and I was just upset and I don't
[27:05] deal with anger because I don't get
[27:06] angry and I was I was just like I don't
[27:09] know what's going on but I'm so
[27:11] upset and I don't know why and um oh I
[27:15] kind of knew why and I was like um and I
[27:17] was like well I'm actually really
[27:19] jealous but I've never felt this emotion
[27:22] before and I don't know how to deal with
[27:24] it and um and then as time progressed
[27:28] um we we ended up going into prayer and
[27:32] in prayer I realized that
[27:38] um okay here we go so my grandma who was
[27:42] like my life when I was growing up my um
[27:46] my parents split up when I was about
[27:48] five and that's normal I would probably
[27:50] rather them be split up and be with what
[27:54] they were together anyways so there
[27:57] there was a broken in the home and then
[27:59] my grandma who was my life oh man she
[28:01] spoiled me rotten talk about giving me
[28:03] lollies when I came in dresses big hugs
[28:07] you know she just was my life she was my
[28:09] everything and um so she was there when
[28:12] my my parents split up and for me and
[28:14] everything like that well she ended up
[28:16] getting lung cancer and um
[28:19] so she died when I was about 5 years old
[28:23] um and then I didn't realize but at that
[28:27] moment as a
[28:28] child you to brace yourself to to
[28:31] protect yourself after she died I put up
[28:33] a
[28:34] wall no one could get in and it was a
[28:37] protective layer
[28:40] really and it served me well
[28:42] actually I I didn't actually love
[28:45] anybody um I didn't let anybody oh thank
[28:49] you I know I tell people I need to go
[28:52] around with the towel okay I'm going to
[28:53] speed this up a bit um but I I never let
[28:58] anybody in I never so when when I
[29:00] thought of my parents I thought oh well
[29:01] if they die you know I'll just I could
[29:03] carry on it won't affect me and then
[29:05] when I married Isaac I thought um oh you
[29:08] know if he died you know it won't affect
[29:09] me I'll just carry on and um but that
[29:12] night I realized the reason why I was
[29:15] never jealous is because I never love
[29:16] something so much and when I let the
[29:19] Lord in my heart that was easy you know
[29:21] I could I could he was easy to come in
[29:23] cuz he cleared everything out um it was
[29:26] um 21 and the Lord came into my heart I
[29:29] met him because I was considered myself
[29:31] an atheist but I met the Lord Jesus
[29:34] Christ and he was easy to let in but
[29:36] then to let another person come in was a
[29:39] little bit different and it wasn't until
[29:41] um about a month or two ago I think
[29:44] about a month sorry um that I actually
[29:48] let my husband in my heart
[29:50] um and I think you know I I loved my
[29:53] husband but there was always like
[29:56] a a barrier of protection there and um
[29:59] so yeah so I let him I let him in and um
[30:02] oh it just hasn't been the same since
[30:05] it's a bit hard
[30:07] because a thing of jealousy will come
[30:09] and I'm like oh I don't like this I feel
[30:11] like a silly little girl you know oh I
[30:14] don't actually enjoy it but um but it's
[30:18] actually made our marriage um well for
[30:21] me it's made it pretty amazing um yeah
[30:24] so I just thank the Lord because I think
[30:26] it's he
[30:27] doesn't put it on us everything at once
[30:30] but he just shows us little as a time
[30:32] and if we just open ourselves to him and
[30:34] say Lord I don't actually know what's
[30:36] going on but if you show me what I have
[30:39] to deal with and then he comes and fixes
[30:41] it for us oh it's amazing so yeah the
[30:44] Lord's doing amazing stuff so I'm really
[30:46] blessed
[30:48] you that was my testimony ah made it
[30:56] through
[31:03] amen praise the Lord amen amen is there
[31:06] anybody else like to
[31:12] share that must have been the Lord's
[31:15] leading amen amen definitely
[31:18] yes sometimes you get a bit nervous when
[31:20] you kind of feel led in you do you do it
[31:23] or do you not do
[31:25] it but you just got to be obedient you
[31:28] know amen
[31:32] hallelujah that's so good to allow the
[31:34] Lord in uh I got a small
[31:36] testimony um it's just the Lord's
[31:39] protection and it's actually if you if
[31:42] you were in if you were experiencing
[31:44] what I experienced you would
[31:46] really um understand and if you're a
[31:49] builder or you're in the trade you would
[31:51] understand a bit more but I was at this
[31:54] job and um
[31:58] I was using this saw and these saws is
[32:02] like this big box thing and it's got a
[32:04] big blade that spins really fast and if
[32:06] it touches you it'll cut you you know
[32:08] it'll mutilate you and and I'm putting
[32:12] this piece of Timber through the saw and
[32:16] the stand is not the right stand for it
[32:18] it doesn't actually connect to the stand
[32:20] properly and I'm putting it through and
[32:23] it's this really hard product and the
[32:25] sore bit into this product and and the
[32:28] product within one second the product
[32:30] was way back on the back wall was was
[32:32] this big heavy plank just on the back
[32:34] wall put a massive hole in the wall and
[32:37] the saw flew towards me like that and
[32:40] went and landed on the ground and I
[32:42] don't know what happened it was kind of
[32:44] like a flashh just a flashh and the saw
[32:47] was on the
[32:48] ground and I was just standing there and
[32:51] like this if most cases I should have
[32:55] been opened up you know dead because
[32:59] this was serious but the Lord protected
[33:01] me amen amen so we can have confidence
[33:05] in the fact that the Lord protects us

[45:06] so praise the Lord so that's good um if
[45:10] you got your Bibles handy let's just go
[45:12] to uh Matthew chapter
[45:24] 22
[45:27] we're going to read Matthew
[45:30] 22:1 down to verse
[45:40] 10 and Jesus
[45:42] answered and spake unto them again by
[45:44] Parables and said the Kingdom of Heaven
[45:47] is like unto like unto a certain King
[45:50] which made a marriage for his son and
[45:52] sent forth his servants to call them
[45:54] that were bidden to the wedding and they
[45:56] would not come again he sent forth other
[45:59] servants saying tell them which are
[46:01] bidden behold I have prepared my dinner
[46:04] my oxen and my fatlings are killed and
[46:06] all things are ready come unto the
[46:08] marriage but they made light of it and
[46:10] went their ways one to his farm the
[46:13] other to his merchandise and the
[46:16] remnant took uh his servants and
[46:18] entreated them spitefully and slew them
[46:21] but when the king heard thereof he was
[46:23] wroth and sent forth his armies
[46:26] uh and destroyed those murderers burned
[46:28] up their City then said he to his
[46:29] servants the wedding is ready but they
[46:32] which are Bitten are not worthy go ye
[46:34] therefore into the highways and as many
[46:36] as you shall find B to the marriage and
[46:38] so the servants went out into the
[46:40] highways and gathered together all as
[46:42] many as they found both good and bad and
[46:46] the wedding was furnished with
[46:49] guests
[46:50] amen let's just um let's just bow our
[46:54] heads in a word of prayer shall we
[46:56] gracious Heavenly
[46:58] Father Lord there's many times when we
[47:01] approach you we feel very insufficient
[47:04] but Lord we thank you we do not need to
[47:05] look at our own s but Lord we look at
[47:08] you and father just your great power and
[47:10] majesty and father how great you are to
[47:13] us Lord and we're just praying as we
[47:16] just open the pages of your word now we
[47:17] read some scripture but father we pray
[47:20] you just take your spirit Lord anoint
[47:22] your word father anoint speaker and
[47:24] hearer one more time
[47:26] Lord we just want to move ourselves out
[47:28] of the way that you can come in and take
[47:29] control of this meeting Lord we give it
[47:32] into your hands and father may you
[47:34] receive all glory honor and praise
[47:36] father we thank you you're the mighty
[47:38] one Lord Jesus you're Our Redeemer Lord
[47:40] You're our savior you're our Lord You're
[47:42] our King you're our husband and father
[47:45] we want to praise you this morning Lord
[47:46] bless those who couldn't be here today
[47:48] Lord be their strength and portion as
[47:50] well and father I pray you'd visit every
[47:52] heart today For Your Glory we ask in
[47:55] Jesus Christ Christ's name amen amen
[47:57] amen God bless you friends you may you
[47:59] may be
[48:00] seated I want
[48:02] to I want to deal with something this
[48:05] morning I want to speak about
[48:07] worthiness My Prayer by the end of this
[48:09] service is that everyone would have
[48:11] Supreme confidence that they can take
[48:13] any promise of God and say it belongs to
[48:16] me amen amen because there's always a
[48:18] there's always a challenge that that
[48:20] maybe I think maybe from our own human
[48:22] Frailty or the devil always tries to put
[48:24] it upon us are you really
[48:26] worthy and if we begin to look at our
[48:29] own s we just see our failures and our
[48:31] faults and you know and then we and then
[48:33] our faith begins to slip but if we can
[48:36] recognize this morning that every
[48:37] promise every promise has been given to
[48:40] us without money or price I mean
[48:42] everything we have need of in this
[48:43] Earthly Journey has been given to us
[48:46] amen all healing has been given
[48:48] salvation's been given Deliverance has
[48:50] been given amen a body change has been
[48:52] given overcoming power has been given
[48:54] amen perfect peace that pass us all
[48:56] understanding has been given joy
[48:58] unspeakable full of Glory has been given
[49:01] everything we have need of has been
[49:02] given amen there's been a full
[49:04] inheritance every remember this is this
[49:06] is the old it's an Old Testament and a
[49:08] new testament an old will and a new will
[49:11] am amen and we live we live in the pages
[49:14] of the new will amen amen so so a will
[49:16] has been given an inheritance has been
[49:18] laid up but then there Comes The
[49:20] Challenge now am I worthy to receive
[49:22] this will am I worthy to receive the
[49:25] contents of The Inheritance you know of
[49:26] the will receive my inheritance and I
[49:29] can say this morning by the authority of
[49:31] God's word we are worthy amen not
[49:33] because we have done anything but
[49:35] because what he has done amen so we
[49:38] should have full confidence everything
[49:39] in the Bible that belongs to me is mine
[49:41] amen and I will possess it it will
[49:43] become mine I will not rest until it
[49:45] becomes mine amen amen so we got to just
[49:48] knock out this whole thing I'm unworthy
[49:50] because he has made us worthy amen
[49:53] that's right Hallelujah you got to look
[49:54] at the promise you you go down through
[49:56] the Old Testament there's their failures
[49:58] there their sins there's their Humanity
[50:00] gets in the way you take Abraham you
[50:02] know he backslides a couple of times
[50:04] goes down out of the promise you know
[50:06] doesn't believe the promise fully and he
[50:08] and he takes you know he listens to
[50:10] Sarah takes Hagar and all those
[50:12] different things but yet when when God
[50:14] writes the commentary of his life in
[50:16] Romans he says he staggered not he
[50:19] staggered not at the promise of God but
[50:21] was strong in faith Hallelujah so now
[50:24] that that is that should be our our
[50:27] commentary of our life amen hallelujah
[50:30] and so now we need to I think I'm
[50:32] getting a bit large I can't wait hold on
[50:35] there we go I was going to feel at home
[50:38] Hallelujah let's just relax hallelujah
[50:41] amen so now we read there in the
[50:43] scripture well I'm going to read a quote
[50:45] to you this from brother
[50:48] brandham and he
[50:53] speaks he says here
[50:57] if I can find it now he begins to talk
[51:00] about praying for someone he says this
[51:02] the other day now now here's a here's a
[51:05] prophet thousands of thousands of
[51:07] visions and most Supernatural Ministry
[51:10] you'll ever find recorded in the history
[51:12] of man that's right Amen brother BR send
[51:14] the token message that Jesus did more in
[51:16] this ministry in this little place he
[51:18] did in the days of his flesh amen so the
[51:21] most incredible Ministry you know you
[51:23] just listen to one you know end of a
[51:26] service a prayer line or discernment you
[51:28] know and you can say this must be God he
[51:31] cannot know these things about these
[51:33] people and it's perfect every time
[51:36] Hallelujah but then so so here's but
[51:38] this is how he feels about himself so
[51:40] the other day over in a little place I
[51:42] was having a meeting in um in Topeka
[51:45] Kansas there was a boy a young preacher
[51:47] one of my first sponsors brother Roy
[51:49] sitting here remembers the place in this
[51:51] this great place this Minister uh got
[51:53] under a roof or a or a place the
[51:56] sidewall mashed him down beneath that
[51:59] the little fellow was going to die his
[52:01] liver was burst his spleen was knocked
[52:02] out of place tons fell on him I sat at
[52:05] breakfast talking to the wife I said
[52:07] wife you know if Jesus was here you know
[52:10] what he'd
[52:11] do uh I said when when he sponsored me I
[52:15] believe that word he was sponsoring
[52:17] Christ and I said that's the trick of
[52:18] the devil I said if Jesus was here he'd
[52:21] go lay his holy hands upon him that boy
[52:23] would get well I don't care if his liver
[52:26] burst bursted he would get well because
[52:28] Jesus would walk in there knowing
[52:30] exactly who he was he knowed his calling
[52:33] uh the scriptures was right vindicating
[52:35] in him that he knowed who he was and not
[52:38] no Shadow of Doubt he had lay his hands
[52:40] upon him he say son be well walk out of
[52:43] there and I said there isn't enough
[52:45] devils in hell to kill that boy then I
[52:47] said he would get well but I said you
[52:50] see honey he was Jesus the holy hands of
[52:52] God I said I'm a sinner I was born
[52:55] sexual birth my father and mother were
[52:57] both Sinners and I'm not uh I'm a no
[53:00] good nothing now he's putting himself as
[53:03] the category of no good nothing okay as
[53:05] I said incredible Ministry God stepped
[53:08] in he took a son redeemed son and
[53:11] revealed the son of man through him
[53:14] never seen a Ministry like it and he
[53:15] says I'm a no good nothing and I said
[53:17] you know what if the lord gave me a
[53:19] vision and sent me down there that would
[53:21] then that would be different I said I'd
[53:23] go down lay my hands on him he'd come
[53:25] out out of that bed if I if he give me a
[53:27] vision then I got to thinking because
[53:29] remember we know sometimes we we can sit
[53:31] back too much and say the Lord has to
[53:33] prompt me or show me certain things but
[53:35] we have the orders of the day go you
[53:37] into all the world and preach the gospel
[53:40] these signs shall follow them that
[53:41] believe you don't have to make them
[53:43] happen the life will produce them amen
[53:45] these signs shall follow them that
[53:47] believe who believes this morning that
[53:49] means you fit in that category
[53:51] Hallelujah it doesn't matter what the
[53:53] devil tries to say about that scripture
[53:54] it's ins fired I've seen it live people
[53:57] around the world have seen it live
[53:59] that's Mark 16 if you're not sure I said
[54:03] but then I got to thinking after all if
[54:05] it was the vision what was it it was the
[54:08] same dirty hands on him same man praying
[54:10] for him same dirty hands then I begin to
[54:13] think I am his representative then God
[54:16] doesn't see me that blood of that
[54:18] righteous one lays up there upon the
[54:20] altar it makes intercessions for me here
[54:23] is my sufficiency here is myay here's my
[54:25] life the only thing that would make me
[54:27] put my hands in him with faith is
[54:29] because I had faith in the vision and
[54:31] without the vision the same Faith would
[54:33] do the same thing Hallelujah so I can
[54:36] reckon myself nothing but reckon him my
[54:38] all and all he is my life he is my
[54:40] commissioner no denomination sent me he
[54:42] sent me Hallelujah I go in his name I'll
[54:45] lay my hands upon him walking down there
[54:47] and laid hands on that boy and that
[54:49] night he was in the meeting solid well
[54:51] amenallah Hallelujah it's the same thing
[54:53] with you and I friends we've been
[54:55] Mission am mean we''re been sent
[54:57] Hallelujah not by some church not by a
[55:00] group of man amen we've been sent by
[55:02] almighty God and mean you've been sent
[55:04] down into this time you are alive in
[55:07] this space of time for a reason not just
[55:09] because your parents wanted you or
[55:11] didn't want you or whatever more God
[55:13] made sure you were born here I mean in
[55:15] this time God made sure you wouldd hear
[55:17] this word there's a reason you're
[55:18] sitting here this morning Hallelujah not
[55:20] a haphazard thing God sent you here
[55:23] you've been commissioned Hallelujah
[55:25] Jeremiah had to be told before you're in
[55:27] your mother's womb I ordained you a
[55:29] prophet to the Nations Hallelujah and
[55:32] you got to look at yourself in the same
[55:34] way before you in your mother's womb I
[55:36] ordained you to be the bride of Christ I
[55:38] mean I ordained you to be Hallelujah
[55:40] made in my image amen hey it either is
[55:43] or it isn't amen and that's why I got to
[55:46] I got to tell you he say well that's
[55:47] quite a big commission if he's
[55:49] commissioned you he's enabled you to do
[55:51] it amen hallelujah amen he has made us
[55:53] Worthy yesen you got to knock out the
[55:56] well I've did this and I've did this and
[55:57] I've did this forget it amen doesn't
[56:00] matter what you do or what you what do
[56:02] you have done is what he has done
[56:04] hallelujah hallelujah cuz remember if
[56:06] you're trying to get on on your own good
[56:08] works you're going to take the good and
[56:09] the bad and the bad always outweighs the
[56:12] good amen so that's why brother B I
[56:15] couldn't find it but he says in one
[56:16] place I don't want to try and get into
[56:18] heaven on my Visions all the Miracles or
[56:21] my preaching I only want to get into
[56:22] heaven on the blood of Jesus Christ
[56:25] Hallelujah and so if the prophet of God
[56:27] can say that we should say that too amen
[56:30] don't don't look at what You' have done
[56:31] look at what he has doneen hallelujah
[56:34] hallelujah praise God amen
[56:39] amen
[56:41] now remember we read there in our
[56:44] opening text the king said they are
[56:47] unworthy the ones who are invited are
[56:50] unworthy to come and the reason they
[56:52] became unworthy is because they turned
[56:54] down the invitation
[56:56] amen but the ones he says get the good
[56:58] and the bad Oh Glory go into and and
[57:01] then there's another part this this uh
[57:03] Parable is told about in Luke 14: 16- 24
[57:08] we won't read it today but you can go
[57:09] read it and there's and the and the
[57:12] servants go out three times and there's
[57:14] a call go into the and and the last one
[57:17] is just go into the highways and byways

[57:21] you think should come just go out Lord
[57:23] hallelujah find find the people my Feast
[57:26] must be full and so it's not the fact
[57:28] that the people had anything you going

[57:53] not in God's mind not in God's thinking
[57:56] he says just compel them to come and
[57:58] they'll come Hallelujah and the reason
[58:01] they're at the feast is they bidden and

[59:23] street and I made bad choices and this
[59:25] is where I am no that has nothing to do
[59:28] with it they said compel them to come
[59:31] amen they weren't told now go out and
[59:34] and ask them a few questions have you

[1:01:16] amen I'm going to read this and we're
[1:01:19] just going to see where we're going to
[1:01:20] go today now 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and
[1:01:23] verse 8
[1:01:26] uh Colossians yes Colossians sorry
[1:01:28] Colossians 1
[1:01:35] and8 he says here who also declared unto
[1:01:39] us your love in the spirit we're just
[1:01:41] dropping halfway through what Paul's
[1:01:43] saying for this cause we
[1:01:48] also waiting for the Indian paper to
[1:01:51] settle
[1:01:53] down for this cause we also since the
[1:01:56] day we heard it do not cease to pray for
[1:01:57] you and to desire that you might be
[1:01:59] filled with the knowledge of his will
[1:02:01] and all wisdom and spiritual
[1:02:02] understanding that you might walk worthy
[1:02:05] of the Lord unto all pleasing being
[1:02:07] fruitful in every good work and
[1:02:08] increasing in the knowledge of God
[1:02:10] strengthen with all might according to
[1:02:12] his glorious power unto all patience and
[1:02:15] longsuffering with joyfulness giving
[1:02:17] thanks unto the Father which hath made
[1:02:19] us meat to be partakers of the
[1:02:21] inheritance of the Saints and light who
[1:02:23] ha delivered us from the powers of dark
[1:02:25] power of Darkness pardon me and has
[1:02:27] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:02:29] dear son in whom we have Redemption
[1:02:32] through his blood even the Forgiveness
[1:02:34] of sins amen so in verse 12 he has made
[1:02:37] us meat to be partakers of the
[1:02:39] inheritance of the Saints and light he
[1:02:40] has made us meat not you not not you not
[1:02:44] you amen him you well I've heard this
[1:02:48] you need to probably might need to hear
[1:02:50] it again because there's a battle
[1:02:52] because we see how yo yo we look at the
[1:02:54] message we look at the word and we look
[1:02:56] at the Holiness life and we look at
[1:02:58] things and it and humanly it becomes
[1:03:01] rules and humanly it becomes well I've
[1:03:03] got to conform no he conforms you to it
[1:03:07] am mean you've got to yield yourself and
[1:03:08] good give yourself am mean and when you
[1:03:11] give yourself he'll take you and he'll
[1:03:13] mold you and he'll shape you Hallelujah
[1:03:15] so it's it's him that makes you worthy
[1:03:17] it's not you that make yourself worthy
[1:03:20] I'm probably going to repeat that many
[1:03:21] times cuz I wanted to sink down under
[1:03:23] the fifth rib on the left hand side and
[1:03:25] fill the whole cavity which is your
[1:03:27] heart by the way hallelu Hallelujah so
[1:03:29] he has made us meat now in the Old
[1:03:33] Testament okay I'll just stop
[1:03:36] here
[1:03:37] we brother Braham says in the token
[1:03:40] message full obedience to the word
[1:03:42] entitles you to the Token which is the
[1:03:44] life of God Amen which is the Holy Ghost
[1:03:47] in you I know it's all it's all kind of
[1:03:50] jargon but it's it's full obedience and
[1:03:52] then he says full obedience to the word
[1:03:54] of God is repent be baptized in the name
[1:03:57] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:03:59] remission of sin and you shall receive
[1:04:01] the token you shall receive the gift of
[1:04:02] the Holy Ghost that is full obedience to
[1:04:04] the word because if you're fully
[1:04:06] repented your heart has been fully
[1:04:07] turned towards him and then you say Lord
[1:04:10] what would you have me do I want to live
[1:04:12] to please you and then everything else
[1:04:14] will come into place Hallelujah so now
[1:04:18] if you have and then brother Ram says if
[1:04:19] you have that token I mean you can you
[1:04:22] can put it into your house you can put
[1:04:24] it in your house amen you can claim your
[1:04:26] loved ones there's power in the life of
[1:04:28] God Amen so now but then now humanly we
[1:04:31] can shrink back and say well am I really
[1:04:34] worthy to to put that on display am I
[1:04:36] really worthy to enforce
[1:04:38] that amen and I say by the authority of
[1:04:41] God's word you are amen am mean why do
[1:04:43] you think it's come into you in the very
[1:04:45] first place I mean the life of God is
[1:04:47] not just to sitting you and be stagnant
[1:04:48] and sit still it's meant to go forth
[1:04:51] Hallelujah the first commandment given
[1:04:53] to man Adam and Eve even before they
[1:04:54] were placed into bodies they said
[1:04:56] multiply and replenish the Earth take
[1:04:59] the take the garden subdue it have
[1:05:01] dominion over the Earth
[1:05:03] expanded that's the life of God
[1:05:06] hallelujah the same thing when when God
[1:05:07] came into the 120 in the upper room
[1:05:11] wasn't just for them to stay what
[1:05:12] happened they were filled with the
[1:05:14] spirit of God they didn't stay there and
[1:05:16] say Glory Hallelujah right brother
[1:05:19] that's a good meeting they went out
[1:05:21] hallelujah hallelujah they couldn't stay
[1:05:23] in that room they went out
[1:05:24] Hallelujah the life went forth
[1:05:27] Hallelujah wants to expand wants to find
[1:05:28] other people thank you Jesus are you
[1:05:31] with me amen so it can't be contained
[1:05:34] and so now if you have that token in you
[1:05:36] you have the life of God in you it won't
[1:05:38] it can't sit still it can't sit it not
[1:05:41] you you it can't sit still amen amen it
[1:05:43] don't want to be placed where it should
[1:05:45] be placed amen we are instructed to get
[1:05:48] all the Liv out of the home yes when you
[1:05:51] apply the token so find all the unbelief
[1:05:54] find all the sin and get it out find all
[1:05:57] the anything it would be that's that
[1:05:59] displeasing to God and get it out of the
[1:06:00] home then apply the token and
[1:06:03] confidence Hallelujah so sure you got to
[1:06:05] do that part but if you've got that
[1:06:07] token on display you say well can I
[1:06:09] really place it over my children can I
[1:06:11] really place it over a loved one can I
[1:06:13] really go after them in prayer yes you
[1:06:15] can Hallelujah yes you can do it you've

[1:06:31] the day of Pentecost what happened
[1:06:33] eternal life went from him and 120 went
[1:06:35] to the 3,000 then he's there in
[1:06:37] cornelius's house he's preaching as he
[1:06:40] Peter spake these words eternal life

[1:07:13] first Ephesians we read in Ephesians it
[1:07:15] says and he hath made us to sit in
[1:07:17] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so it's
[1:07:19] not you making yourself sit in Heavenly
[1:07:21] atmospheres he has made you amen he
[1:07:24] caused you to sit in a different realm
[1:07:26] Hallelujah that's why the believer gets
[1:07:27] excited about things and the unbeliever
[1:07:29] looks at them saying what are you so
[1:07:31] excited about this is just some dead
[1:07:33] religion no it's not some dead religion

[1:07:39] something bubbling Hallelujah bubbling
[1:07:41] forth glory to God hallelujah you think

[1:07:46] people say when I get over there then
[1:07:48] I'll really Let Go no let go down here
[1:07:51] show the victory of Calvary here
[1:07:53] hallelujah cuz the devil's here he's
[1:07:54] opposing you amen but you should be say
[1:07:56] Glory Hallelujah praise Him GL amen from
[1:08:00] your heart you can be quiet doesn't
[1:08:01] matter how it manifests but if your
[1:08:03] heart is bursting forth with joy you can
[1:08:05] be a quiet person that's fine amen you
[1:08:08] can be loud that's fine however however
[1:08:09] it manifest let it
[1:08:11] manifest hallelujah thank he has made us
[1:08:15] to sit in Heavenly
[1:08:16] places now in the Old Testament what was
[1:08:20] examined when The Sinner went with a
[1:08:22] sacrifice
[1:08:24] someone answer me this is now the
[1:08:27] sacrifice thank you very much the
[1:08:29] sacrifice was examined the sinner was
[1:08:31] not examined he said because he could go
[1:08:34] or she could go am I worthy to give this
[1:08:37] sacrifice well he W the the cner wasn't
[1:08:39] even Bor to wasn't even examined as soon
[1:08:42] as the priest laid hold eyes upon the
[1:08:45] the lamb or you know the Bullock or the
[1:08:47] go whereever it was the priest said okay
[1:08:50] you go over here I've got to examine
[1:08:52] this and that was examined and if that
[1:08:55] was examined the sinner was was was uh
[1:08:58] accepted am me their offering was
[1:09:01] accepted Hallelujah so the so so just
[1:09:04] say if I was in the Old Testament I did
[1:09:05] something I I bring a lamb to the priest
[1:09:08] the pressure is not on
[1:09:10] me you following me the pressure is not
[1:09:12] on me the pressure is on have I picked
[1:09:14] the right lamb is the Lamb is the Lamb
[1:09:17] going to be accepted cuz if that lamb is
[1:09:19] accepted I'm going to be accepted
[1:09:22] Hallelujah and then so the would look at
[1:09:24] the lamb and he would look at it and say
[1:09:26] it's perfect amen hallelujah GL and then
[1:09:29] now and then I placed my hand upon the
[1:09:31] head of that lamb and the priest kills
[1:09:33] that lamb and the life goes out of that
[1:09:35] lamb in my place and my sin is
[1:09:38] transferred onto that lamb Hallelujah
[1:09:40] then I can go away Justified you're
[1:09:43] following me amen amen so now it's the
[1:09:45] lamb that had to be perfect right now in
[1:09:49] the Old Testament the life of that
[1:09:51] lambing an animal could not come upon me
[1:09:53] and changed my nature so the thing that
[1:09:56] caused me to bring the offering in the
[1:09:57] first place I would leave with that same
[1:09:59] desire though I justified in the sight
[1:10:01] of God right but now our lamb I love our
[1:10:05] lamb he's a glorious lamb amen our lamb
[1:10:08] now he went there into Pilot's judgment
[1:10:10] Hall he was examined am Hallelujah he
[1:10:13] was examined and they say I find no
[1:10:15] fault in this man he is a perfect lamb
[1:10:18] Hallelujah took your sin that day up
[1:10:20] Calvary amen and so now we have a living
[1:10:22] we have a perfect lamb he didn't just
[1:10:24] die but he rose again Hallelujah he took
[1:10:27] his blood when he when he when he
[1:10:28] revealed himself to to Mary by the tomb
[1:10:31] he said don't touch me I haven't
[1:10:33] ascended up yet I haven't lifted the
[1:10:35] offering up Hallelujah then he ascends
[1:10:38] he comes back down says Thomas touched
[1:10:40] the holes in my hand and my side
[1:10:43] Hallelujah because the blood was
[1:10:44] accepted he came back down that's my
[1:10:47] land that's my land and we are made
[1:10:50] accepted in the Beloved am mean so if
[1:10:53] he's accepted I'm accepted amen
[1:10:55] hallelujah if he was accounted worthy
[1:10:57] then therefore I'm
[1:10:58] worthy hallelujah hallelujah glory to
[1:11:01] God so we don't need to worry that's
[1:11:03] right he said but what about me no don't
[1:11:06] worry about you him he was accepted now
[1:11:10] there is in the
[1:11:12] Scripture it says if you abide in me and
[1:11:14] my words abide in you ask what you will
[1:11:16] and it shall be done now the reformers
[1:11:19] took that scripture under a manage
[1:11:20] anointing and they would write many
[1:11:22] books about abiding INR CHR and how to
[1:11:24] abide in Christ and this is what you
[1:11:25] must do but here this is not even though
[1:11:28] it is good to you know and then so they
[1:11:30] will put it down to have you read enough
[1:11:33] have you prayed enough then you can ask
[1:11:34] what you will cuz you're abiding but
[1:11:36] that is not what it is actually strictly
[1:11:38] saying it's saying if my word I'm a
[1:11:41] Living Word the logos of God himself if
[1:11:43] I come and abide in you you abide in me
[1:11:46] ask what you will so if the Living God
[1:11:49] is this making sense to some people if
[1:11:51] the Living God he says if I dwell in you
[1:11:53] ask what you will and it shall be that's
[1:11:56] how you abide
[1:11:58] hallelujah amen so it's not out remember
[1:12:01] we should pray no we should this is
[1:12:03] incredible you see what God and I don't
[1:12:05] have a message book but if I had them to
[1:12:07] me it's all the same cuz the message
[1:12:09] came out of here it's incredible what we
[1:12:12] have Hallelujah this word the same God
[1:12:15] that said let there be light let there
[1:12:17] be sun moon and stars I'm going to place
[1:12:19] a Milky wave like this I did it with my
[1:12:21] word place the sun here h that
[1:12:23] everything by his word that same God
[1:12:25] came down and spoke in this generation
[1:12:28] that's right hallelujah it's incredible
[1:12:30] it's got creative power this word so I
[1:12:33] think it behooves us to really listen
[1:12:35] really read make it a daily
[1:12:38] diet
[1:12:39] Hallelujah it'll do you good that's
[1:12:42] right it'll do you real good amen so
[1:12:45] he's saying if you abide in me and my
[1:12:46] words abide in you ask what you will and
[1:12:48] it shall
[1:12:49] be if I have him abiding in me then
[1:12:53] therefore I have I can have confidence I
[1:12:56] can ask what I will and remember if my
[1:12:58] will is surrendered to his it's not my
[1:13:00] human will being asked anyway it's his
[1:13:02] will he following me but then therefore
[1:13:06] I have confidence I can ask what I will
[1:13:07] and it shall be if to agree on Earth
[1:13:11] then I'll agree in heaven and it'll be
[1:13:13] so yeah amen that's why I think we
[1:13:15] really need to start greeing agreeing
[1:13:18] with each other more than just mentally
[1:13:20] pray for so and so I agree amen I'm with
[1:13:23] you amen and you'll see things
[1:13:25] happen hallelujah amen true
[1:13:32] now
[1:13:33] Hallelujah you take Jesus Jesus's
[1:13:37] Ministry had three
[1:13:38] phases just like brother
[1:13:41] brandham jesus' Ministry there was a lot
[1:13:43] of healing there's discernment and in
[1:13:45] the word he revealed himself who he was
[1:13:48] now it says in John chapter 1 that he
[1:13:50] came to his own and his own received him
[1:13:51] not but many has received gave he the
[1:13:54] power to be to be made you know the sons
[1:13:56] of God and so there was an invitation
[1:14:00] when the son of man when Jesus was made
[1:14:02] flesh there was an invitation to come to
[1:14:05] the wedding supper and the people who
[1:14:08] should have come turned it
[1:14:10] down and the people who who were not
[1:14:13] worthy humanly not worthy they were the
[1:14:15] ones who made it in you know you
[1:14:18] take you take the woman
[1:14:22] who know she she in uh Luke chapter 7
[1:14:26] there's a woman who had an alabaster box
[1:14:29] of
[1:14:30] ointment and there was a there was a
[1:14:32] feast going on at at a Pharisees house
[1:14:36] and all these things were arranged but
[1:14:38] it wasn't for them Jesus was invited
[1:14:40] Jesus always goes where he's invited
[1:14:42] right he always goes where he's invited
[1:14:44] if you invite him say Lord come and take
[1:14:46] my life and make it yours he'll come
[1:14:49] because he came to a Pharisees house and
[1:14:51] the Pharisee wasn't there to give him
[1:14:52] honor make him the give him the best
[1:14:54] seed and look after him the best you
[1:14:56] know he came to that place and it was
[1:14:58] custom that day that the people's feet
[1:15:01] would be washed you they'd be anointed
[1:15:04] you know with perfumes and so on and
[1:15:06] they' be given a nice robe and they' be
[1:15:07] made welcome he didn't all of that Jesus
[1:15:10] didn't receive so he wasn't even really
[1:15:12] welcome but he went
[1:15:13] anyway and so now here was here was the
[1:15:17] Pharisees uh golden opportunity they had
[1:15:19] a captive audience they had a captive
[1:15:22] audience with with God himself you think
[1:15:25] about the incredible magnitude you know
[1:15:27] only a certain amount of time there he
[1:15:29] is eternal life is in my house eternal
[1:15:33] life I can speak to eternal life will
[1:15:35] speak back to me Hallelujah but yet they
[1:15:38] made fun of him they didn't think too
[1:15:41] highly of him and there's a woman in the
[1:15:43] city she wasn't invited she wasn't
[1:15:45] invited to this Feast you know the story
[1:15:47] very well but maybe I was try to
[1:15:49] dramatize a little bit she wasn't
[1:15:51] invited but something moved with within
[1:15:54] her something moved within her I must
[1:15:56] get to where Jesus is hallelujah I must
[1:15:59] get to where Jesus is and not only did
[1:16:02] she go just you know just herself like
[1:16:05] that but she took all the money she had
[1:16:08] and she got an alabaster box of ointment
[1:16:11] a lot of money was given for that now it
[1:16:14] didn't matter how she got that money
[1:16:16] Jesus didn't care didn't matter what
[1:16:18] your old life consisted of Jesus doesn't
[1:16:21] doesn't care he doesn't care where
[1:16:23] you've where you've been what you've
[1:16:25] done what you've said it doesn't
[1:16:27] matter amen that that doesn't matter in
[1:16:30] his economy because we're all born in
[1:16:33] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:16:35] speaking lies amen you can be raised up
[1:16:38] in the message you can be on the street
[1:16:41] same same bracket in God's God's economy
[1:16:44] amen so she took this and she found
[1:16:46] where Jesus was Hallelujah and she took
[1:16:50] him by the feet began to be and and and
[1:16:52] broke the alabaster box anointed his
[1:16:54] feet amen you begin to be you know begin
[1:16:58] to weep wash his feet wash his feet with
[1:17:01] her tears and and the only tell she had
[1:17:03] was God's provided way and mean was her
[1:17:06] a glorious long hair and she began to
[1:17:08] wipe his feet and kiss his
[1:17:10] feet he was a now he was one you think
[1:17:14] the Pharisees outwardly that would be
[1:17:17] invited to the feast they were but they
[1:17:19] turned it down amen they turned down the
[1:17:22] invitation he was one something pulled
[1:17:24] her into that place yes amen something
[1:17:27] just pulled she didn't really maybe
[1:17:29] understand what was going on this man is
[1:17:31] more than a man I must get to his feet I
[1:17:34] must give him some kind of service I
[1:17:35] must worship Him in some way hallelujah
[1:17:39] amen and so she did that now yes and
[1:17:42] then the Pharisee began to make
[1:17:43] fun if he really was a prophet he would
[1:17:47] know M what manner of woman she was
[1:17:50] because for she is a sinner
[1:17:53] but Jesus now just let it go on and
[1:17:57] sometimes it's the same thing with us in
[1:17:58] the Lord he'll come to I trust this be
[1:18:01] remember this word this message is the
[1:18:05] invitation it is brother BR said the
[1:18:07] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:18:09] this amen the bridegroom call will come
[1:18:11] right through this message he says
[1:18:13] that's right and so there's been an
[1:18:14] invitation being sent out and you'll see
[1:18:18] jesus' Ministry parallels brother bram's
[1:18:21] Ministry parallels Jesus because it's
[1:18:22] the same Jesus Christ but not in a body
[1:18:25] of Flesh like the first time but a
[1:18:26] redeemed body a redeemed son was
[1:18:29] revealing the son of man and so now so
[1:18:32] he had three phases of his ministry
[1:18:34] there was the healings and there's the
[1:18:35] discernment then there's the word open
[1:18:37] Jesus Christ revealed himself and so now
[1:18:39] where were by the end of his ministry
[1:18:42] where were all the churches where were
[1:18:44] the ones who actually invited the first
[1:18:46] part of his ministry they turned it down
[1:18:48] that's right he says you know you talks
[1:18:50] about the Full Gospel businessman he
[1:18:52] says you know this is like an open door
[1:18:54] to me amen and also he had to live out
[1:18:57] the scripture behold I stand the door
[1:18:59] and knock because that's speaking of our
[1:19:02] age Jesus on the outside of his church
[1:19:04] and he says I've been in tucon about 3
[1:19:06] years I've been not been invited once
[1:19:08] anywhere trying to get in wasn't the
[1:19:11] prophet trying to get Jesus trying to
[1:19:13] get in it had to become flesh cuz but
[1:19:16] they turned down the invitation that's
[1:19:18] right and then here we are amen
[1:19:20] hallelujah let's just jump to you now
[1:19:22] here we are where he says go get the
[1:19:24] lame the halt the blind go to the
[1:19:27] highways and byways get the good and the
[1:19:30] bad bring them to my supper Hallelujah
[1:19:33] and something in you says yes I will
[1:19:35] come I will go I receed an invitation I
[1:19:39] mean because his word is God for that's
[1:19:41] why there's something in you that's
[1:19:42] moving it's more than just excitement or
[1:19:45] whatever it's beyond that Hallelujah am
[1:19:48] mean I've been in I've been in Papa New
[1:19:49] Guinea people don't even stand
[1:19:51] understand English God move M am
[1:19:53] Hallelujah and they become United
[1:19:55] they're different people hallelujah why
[1:19:58] because they had an invitation they just
[1:20:00] hadn't heard it yet then the invitation
[1:20:02] went out amen hallelujah so Glory
[1:20:06] doesn't matter what you think you are
[1:20:09] forget what you think you are I mean
[1:20:11] just forget about it he's invited you I
[1:20:14] I just want to hammer it through he's
[1:20:16] made you worthy amen If he if you if you
[1:20:19] weren't called amen you have to be made
[1:20:22] worthy in order to be called and he made
[1:20:24] you worthy by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:20:26] forget about what you remember I said
[1:20:28] many times Esther she was a Jew living
[1:20:31] in a foreign Nation she couldn't even
[1:20:33] use her Jewish name anymore she you she
[1:20:35] was called hadasa in the Hebrew language

[1:24:02] just looking for work and I found myself
[1:24:04] here in Wellington God allowed that to
[1:24:06] happen God Allowed no offers to to to be
[1:24:09] accepted down there in Christ Church and
[1:24:11] two to be given up here and now I'm in
[1:24:12] this place amen God's good at
[1:24:15] orchestrating things he's real good
[1:24:17] right Hallelujah so now here's so here's
[1:24:20] e now and then the decree Goes Forth
[1:24:23] hmon and his
[1:24:24] trickery there's a law goes out all the
[1:24:27] Jews Must Die 13th day of the 12th month
[1:24:30] or the other way around I can't remember
[1:24:31] exactly now here she is this is where
[1:24:34] you
[1:24:35] are she hasn't been called in before the
[1:24:38] king for 30 days and has death to go on
[1:24:41] Uninvited right now and so here we are
[1:24:44] she's like well morai get all the Jews
[1:24:47] to fast and pray 3 days I'll do the same
[1:24:50] and then I'll go in she was AF afraid to
[1:24:53] go into the presence of the one who
[1:24:54] loved
[1:24:55] her sometimes we get
[1:24:58] scared amen sometimes we get scared oh
[1:25:00] he'll he knows all about your life
[1:25:02] anyway right you must just be honest he
[1:25:04] knows what you're thinking even now he
[1:25:06] knows what you're going through don't
[1:25:09] try and put on some facade just knock it
[1:25:11] down what happens in an earthquake the
[1:25:13] first thing that falls off the building
[1:25:15] is the
[1:25:16] facade Hallelujah so just let it shake
[1:25:18] and let it fall you with me that's true
[1:25:22] and so no yes she is but she but she
[1:25:24] decides within
[1:25:26] herself no I'm the
[1:25:28] queen if I perish I perish that's right
[1:25:32] she puts the crown on that she was given
[1:25:35] something about the crown that just
[1:25:36] fitted just right it didn't fit vasty
[1:25:39] just right but it fit hurt just right
[1:25:41] and you find as you as you walk with him
[1:25:43] there's something about this word It
[1:25:44] just fits just right something in my
[1:25:46] soul is just something just just locks
[1:25:48] in and it's glorious and then she puts
[1:25:50] on a royal apparel as it would say and
[1:25:53] she goes in before the king amen if she
[1:25:56] didn't go sure as Mori said Deliverance
[1:25:59] will come from another place that's the
[1:26:01] reason she was there the reason she was
[1:26:03] there she had gone before the king and
[1:26:05] there's two things on her mind we have
[1:26:08] an enemy friends you have an enemy that
[1:26:10] fights you every day that's right he is
[1:26:12] against you that's right if he can't if
[1:26:14] he can't knock your faith in one way you
[1:26:17] know we are not under a pressure of of
[1:26:20] of uh recant or birth
[1:26:23] we're not under that pressure but we're
[1:26:24] under a pressure of the business of life
[1:26:27] we can just Cruise along go from from
[1:26:29] Monday to Monday and oh I'm chasing this
[1:26:32] and chasing this and I need this and you
[1:26:34] know it's just all kind of watered down
[1:26:36] and that's the pressure we have amen
[1:26:39] because you'll find in countries where
[1:26:40] the poorer it is it's the better quality
[1:26:42] actually the believer
[1:26:44] is amen you'll find it the poorer the
[1:26:48] less they have the more spiritual they
[1:26:50] are and I and and I look at that and
[1:26:53] brother B even says it may not be in
[1:26:55] these words but he says actually this
[1:26:57] this civilization this this easiness of
[1:26:59] life is a
[1:27:01] curse amen it's actually to have too
[1:27:03] much is actually a curse because you can
[1:27:06] just you can just float along everything
[1:27:07] can just be
[1:27:08] fine but over there in those places the
[1:27:11] third world they call upon God they see
[1:27:14] God live and all they have is him amen
[1:27:17] and that's all we should have is him now
[1:27:19] I'm not saying go live in a shack
[1:27:20] someplace you can have what you have but

[1:27:49] you follow me she was placed as the
[1:27:50] queen and she didn't put herself there
[1:27:53] there would have been a whole bunch of
[1:27:54] other women in the in the Palace of the

[1:28:59] look at the world this world is is
[1:29:01] falling apart yes sir Hallelujah and the
[1:29:04] reason it's falling apart is because one
[1:29:06] the Brokenness of man but to a prophet
[1:29:09] stood and he declared the world is
[1:29:11] falling apart again that's right and it
[1:29:13] is and every time the world is falling
[1:29:15] apart God sends Deliverance Hallelujah
[1:29:19] and it's those that receive the
[1:29:20] invitation of that Deliverance I mean
[1:29:22] they don't fall apart with the world
[1:29:24] that's right that's right

[1:29:41] the Mori and her are given the authority
[1:29:44] amen the signant ring that they would
[1:29:46] seal every law that cannot change was
[1:29:49] placed in mori's hand so now they had
[1:29:52] the ability to enforce Hallelujah to
[1:29:55] enforce upon the enemy what they could
[1:29:57] what they will amen hallelujah and is

[1:30:46] promises and if it's promised to me I
[1:30:48] say God give it to me Hallelujah all you
[1:30:51] have is get rid of yourself out of the
[1:30:53] way you are the biggest brother Bram
[1:30:55] said the biggest enemy I have is William
[1:30:57] brandham if I can get William Bram out
[1:30:59] of the way he said will God will do
[1:31:02] things that William Bram knows nothing
[1:31:03] about and here's a man who went past the
[1:31:06] curtain of time seven angels met him on
[1:31:08] a Mountain Seven cells came open to him
[1:31:11] the sword was placed the word was placed
[1:31:13] in his hand Hallelujah dispensation of
[1:31:15] the Gospel is given to him he says if I
[1:31:18] can just get myself out of the way God
[1:31:20] will do things willing br knows nothing
[1:31:22] about and we sit here and we say man
[1:31:25] imagine just a
[1:31:27] day walking like he walked thousands of
[1:31:30] vision sometimes he didn't he said I'm
[1:31:32] standing in he'd be standing in front of
[1:31:34] way more people than this thousands of
[1:31:35] people said I'm standing in Two
[1:31:37] Worlds he was here and then there's an
[1:31:40] eternal realm was opened up that's why
[1:31:42] he could look at people and God wrot him
[1:31:44] up this is where you were this is what
[1:31:45] happened to you when you were young and
[1:31:47] he sees it lived out in front of him
[1:31:49] he's not guessing as a vision opener
[1:31:51] that's and then you see on the Deep P
[1:31:53] the Deep film he like rubs his face
[1:31:56] where am I you got to look at it cuz
[1:31:58] he's in Two Worlds say oh isn't that
[1:32:01] incredible said if I just get myself out
[1:32:03] of the way God can do things I know
[1:32:05] nothing about amen and it's the same
[1:32:07] thing with us if we can just get
[1:32:09] ourselves out of the
[1:32:11] way amen hallelujah what could God do I
[1:32:14] do not know are you just trying to
[1:32:16] excite us
[1:32:18] no all things are possible to them that
[1:32:20] believe amen means there is nothing
[1:32:22] impossible with you that's right all
[1:32:24] things are possible to them that believe
[1:32:26] that means there's nothing impossible
[1:32:27] with you I can do all things through
[1:32:30] Jesus Christ all
[1:32:33] things amen so I would look into the
[1:32:37] inheritance now so she so now they had a
[1:32:40] signant ring they had the right to
[1:32:43] enforce whatever they did they could put
[1:32:44] it into
[1:32:46] law friends that's the Seal of the king
[1:32:49] they had in their hands they had the
[1:32:51] king seal yeah whatever you do don't
[1:32:53] just let it sit idle amen that's right
[1:32:56] don't let it sit idle that's I think I
[1:32:58] said last Sunday or whenever the devil
[1:33:00] tries to rob us of prayer so much amen
[1:33:03] if we can just get into his presence you
[1:33:05] say well he'll never leave us nor
[1:33:07] forsake us that's true but there's a
[1:33:09] time when you pray and then he takes
[1:33:12] over amen and that is where God really
[1:33:15] steps upon the scene remember God wants
[1:33:17] to use human flesh to see his word
[1:33:19] fulfilled amen amen
[1:33:23] so whatever you do you say well that's
[1:33:27] being a bit too radical making God
[1:33:30] everything no it's not too radical right
[1:33:33] Moses Moses made God everything the
[1:33:36] Apostle I'm just going to pick a whole
[1:33:37] bunch of names the Apostle Paul made God
[1:33:39] everything King David made God
[1:33:41] everything that's right amen when he
[1:33:43] wasn't
[1:33:44] backslid
[1:33:46] right amen a backslider is filled with
[1:33:49] all his ways it says in the scripture so
[1:33:51] if you find yourself getting busy with
[1:33:53] all other stuff and your and your walk
[1:33:55] with God is being neglected there's
[1:33:56] something
[1:33:57] wrong amen maybe a bit of a stinger but
[1:34:01] it's true amen amen now I'm not talking
[1:34:04] about looking after your family and
[1:34:05] going to work on those things we have to
[1:34:06] do those things but I need this Hobby
[1:34:08] and this Hobby and this Hobby and let's
[1:34:09] do this hold on you've only got 24 hours
[1:34:13] I have the same amount of time in the
[1:34:15] day that the president of United States
[1:34:17] does or whoever so they have the same
[1:34:20] time but let's use the time for him
[1:34:23] let's use the time for our families
[1:34:25] let's build memories with our
[1:34:27] children amen let's do it let's spend
[1:34:30] time let's have fellowship with them
[1:34:32] well they won't understand you just go
[1:34:33] down to the you got to think whatever
[1:34:35] age they are thoughts that's how brother
[1:34:37] said how do you help them think their
[1:34:38] age thoughts and and talk to them on
[1:34:40] that level and then bring them up to
[1:34:42] where you are
[1:34:45] hallelujah amen
[1:34:47] now I want to read this this is from
[1:34:50] I've mentioned it a few
[1:34:52] times but this is from the church age
[1:34:56] book about now but the Jews you say well
[1:35:00] but what about your works I've said
[1:35:02] before if you're motivated by love it's
[1:35:04] not works okay but he says this about
[1:35:07] how it's not okay I'll just read it but
[1:35:09] the Jews back there in the time of Jesus
[1:35:11] did not want to accept that sacrifice
[1:35:13] speaking of Jesus sacrifice the blood of
[1:35:15] bulls and goats made nothing perfect it
[1:35:18] was once God's ordained method but now
[1:35:20] Christ having a In the Flesh and by the
[1:35:22] shedding of his own blood has put away
[1:35:25] sin and by that offering of himself has
[1:35:27] made us perfect Hallelujah hello
[1:35:30] perfected ones amen how are you repeat
[1:35:33] after me I have been made perfect I made
[1:35:37] perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ by
[1:35:39] the blood of Jesus Christ amen yep hallu
[1:35:44] it's
[1:35:45] true that's what the Bible says I be
[1:35:47] made perfect well what about for the
[1:35:49] perfecting of the Saints there's a
[1:35:51] sinless Perfection and then there's a
[1:35:53] maturing yes don't worry about the don't
[1:35:56] worry about the maturing just walk with
[1:35:58] him and you'll mature just walk with
[1:36:00] himall it's like you know you take a
[1:36:02] little child just begins to walk they
[1:36:04] don't get all stressed and crying I
[1:36:06] don't know if I can you know run I can't
[1:36:08] do what they do you know I can't drive a
[1:36:10] car and I I can't you know I can't vote
[1:36:13] and I can't go to work and they're not
[1:36:15] worri they just grow get up every
[1:36:16] morning hello here we are you know and
[1:36:19] they just grow mature
[1:36:22] amen just relax amen and let him have
[1:36:25] his way you want to see the supernatural
[1:36:27] just relax that doesn't mean sit back
[1:36:29] and watch the world go by but just relax
[1:36:31] don't get all stressed you get all
[1:36:33] stressed up in your spirit and you're
[1:36:35] just fighting this thing just just relax
[1:36:38] who's in control who have you given your
[1:36:40] life to who have you yielded yourself to
[1:36:43] amen if you get all stressed God can't
[1:36:45] really work just relax yeah Lord anoint
[1:36:48] my life whatever gift is in my life just
[1:36:51] just let it you take it and manifest
[1:36:54] yourself amen whatever office I'm a
[1:36:57] husband or a your dad mom whatever Lord
[1:37:01] take that office manifest yourself
[1:37:03] through
[1:37:04] it now where was I Jews would not take
[1:37:08] that the Jews would not take that but
[1:37:11] what about the Philadelphian ages about
[1:37:13] John Wesley's age and yes the other ages
[1:37:14] too did they really accept this in real
[1:37:17] this reality in Christ so when I read
[1:37:19] this the reality did they accept the
[1:37:22] reality no sir even though Luther
[1:37:25] brought the truth of justification the
[1:37:27] romanist church and its eastern
[1:37:29] counterpart the Orthodox Church still
[1:37:31] clung to works now works are fine but
[1:37:33] they don't save you they don't make you
[1:37:35] perfect it is Christ or perish it is not
[1:37:39] even Christ and works it is Christ Alone
[1:37:42] this age began the years of Armenian ISM
[1:37:46] that does not believe in Christ as the
[1:37:50] reality okay okay it does not sing
[1:37:52] nothing but the blood for it sings
[1:37:54] nothing but the blood and my own
[1:37:58] conduct right remember I'll just read
[1:38:00] this now I believe in Good Conduct if
[1:38:03] you are saved you will do righteously we
[1:38:06] have already gone over that but let me
[1:38:07] tell you now salvation is not Jesus plus
[1:38:11] it is Jesus alone salvation is of the
[1:38:14] Lord From the Start to Finish it's all
[1:38:16] God let his life be in me let his blood
[1:38:19] let it be his blood that CLE es me let
[1:38:22] it be his spirit that fills me let it be
[1:38:24] his word in my mouth and heart let it be
[1:38:27] his stripes that heal me Let It Be Jesus
[1:38:29] and Jesus alone not by works of
[1:38:31] righteousness which I have done no sir
[1:38:34] Christ is my life amen am amen so it's
[1:38:38] you see they did not
[1:38:40] accept the P atoning power of Christ in
[1:38:44] reality and that's what we have to
[1:38:47] receive is it in reality amen yes not
[1:38:50] just up here Jesus Paid It all but down
[1:38:53] here Jesus Paid It all and all to him I
[1:38:56] owe amen but he washed me wide as snow
[1:38:59] it's got to be in reality God hallelujah
[1:39:03] that takes and now if it's if it's him
[1:39:05] if it's he's done it in reality to you
[1:39:08] then he's made me worthy amen we are his
[1:39:11] workmanship that's right amen we are his
[1:39:14] work we're not our own workmanship
[1:39:15] remember we read we love to read
[1:39:17] Ephesians chapter 2 that we're saved by
[1:39:19] grace grace alone at least any you know
[1:39:22] at least any man should boast in his
[1:39:23] works whatever more but we got to
[1:39:25] remember if we're saved by grace what is
[1:39:26] our walk
[1:39:28] by right because oh I've been saved by
[1:39:30] grace and now here we go now I've got to
[1:39:32] do this and I've got to do this is this
[1:39:34] right and am I am I saying the right
[1:39:36] things and am I doing this right and
[1:39:37] have I prayed the right way and have I
[1:39:39] listened to enough and I need to do this
[1:39:41] I and then I need to do this and and
[1:39:43] then well what's that
[1:39:45] now what's that now you're you're
[1:39:47] injecting your own works and
[1:39:49] subconsciously cuz man needs to achieve
[1:39:51] something man always you look at the
[1:39:53] religions of the world it can be you go
[1:39:56] Catholic okay I'll just take the maybe
[1:39:58] the three big ones
[1:40:00] Catholicism Islam Hinduism whatever more
[1:40:03] what do they do they do pilgrimages they
[1:40:06] go to places and they say certain amount
[1:40:07] of prayers and they if you it's all
[1:40:09] about if you do this and this and this
[1:40:11] then maybe you'll obtain what you want
[1:40:13] why cu the devil's used The Human
[1:40:15] Condition of trying his own ability to
[1:40:18] to climb up to where he fell from
[1:40:21] and he uses that he turns it into a you
[1:40:23] know turns it into a religion and just
[1:40:25] beats the people down with it then so
[1:40:27] subconsciously because we're built that
[1:40:28] way we're like we see this this has been
[1:40:31] manifested in this hour this message you
[1:40:34] see what God did through through the
[1:40:36] prophet
[1:40:37] Ministry and then he and when he speaks
[1:40:39] about now the bride of Christ she is
[1:40:41] bone of his bone life of his life F
[1:40:44] flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit
[1:40:47] she is him and the rising of the sun
[1:40:49] she's made in His image
[1:40:51] then we look at that say oh how do I
[1:40:53] become this do we not humanly we say how
[1:40:57] can I I could never have tame to that
[1:40:59] and humanly you can never obame to it
[1:41:02] right but if you let him take you that's
[1:41:04] why you got to just let let go let go
[1:41:07] people get frustrated oh I can't do this
[1:41:09] and I'm sick of Let Go amen forget your
[1:41:13] frustration that's we were all
[1:41:15] frustrated once upon a time and then God
[1:41:17] says are you done yet that's right it's
[1:41:19] like a child throwing a tto you could
[1:41:21] just sit
[1:41:24] there got make a cup of coffee come back
[1:41:26] sometimes they're real
[1:41:28] determin and then you can look at them
[1:41:30] and say are you done yet yeah and then
[1:41:33] sometimes they're not done so you go
[1:41:34] have another cup of coffee go do and you
[1:41:36] come back and it's like us and God
[1:41:38] that's right he looks at us and go ah
[1:41:40] we're trying to and then he just stands
[1:41:42] there because he's Eternal he's not
[1:41:43] worried he's not in a hurry we get in a
[1:41:45] hurry he's not hurry hey looks at us say
[1:41:48] you done that's right have you given up
[1:41:51] you know and we you know we we cuz we
[1:41:54] want to I want to Lord are you done and
[1:41:58] then eventually you say Lord nothing in
[1:42:00] my arms I bring simply to th Cross I
[1:42:03] clle take me as I am mold me shap me now
[1:42:07] Hallelujah and says now I'm ready to

[1:42:11] and use you Hallelujah I'm glad it's
[1:42:15] that way don't you hallelujah amen so
[1:42:18] now that's why I'm so glad
[1:42:21] that this walk is a walk of love amen
[1:42:24] amen and it is his remember the the
[1:42:26] definition of Grace in the New Testament
[1:42:29] is graciousness it says especially the
[1:42:31] Divine influence upon the heart amen so
[1:42:35] it's his influence upon your heart which
[1:42:36] turned you around it's his influence
[1:42:38] upon your heart which made you fully
[1:42:40] surrender your life it's his influence
[1:42:42] upon your heart you opened open the door
[1:42:43] and he came and dwelt in you you died to
[1:42:45] yourself anden it's hisence upon your
[1:42:47] heart you say Lord I want to walk with
[1:42:49] you amen Hallelujah go look at it in the
[1:42:52] strongest concordance that's why I'm so
[1:42:54] glad Enoch Enoch walked with god what
[1:42:56] happened a Divine influence Came Upon
[1:42:57] him May he's a shadow of us so he began
[1:43:00] to walk with God then one day he just
[1:43:02] took one more step it's just like
[1:43:03] another day you think this Rapture you
[1:43:06] look at the Saints and the you know the
[1:43:08] you the
[1:43:09] resurrection they're just going about
[1:43:11] their
[1:43:12] day and here the greatest week of
[1:43:14] History brother Ram says it is the death
[1:43:16] bear Resurrection amen here they are
[1:43:19] they're down they're sad
[1:43:21] their life has gone sideways cuz they
[1:43:23] the one they believe is the Messiah he's
[1:43:25] dead the Ministries locked themselves
[1:43:27] away and the accountant of the church
[1:43:29] has hung himself things have gone bad
[1:43:33] but then during that time here's our
[1:43:35] lord Jesus Hallelujah he goes down into
[1:43:37] hell preaches to the souls in prison
[1:43:40] goes down knocks on kicks on Satan's
[1:43:42] door you know takes the keys of Hell

[1:49:39] military you have the standing orders or
[1:49:41] whatever it's called it's just this is
[1:49:42] this is the routine what you do and then
[1:49:44] if there's a change there's the orders
[1:49:45] of the day this is the standing
[1:49:48] orders go in into all and he said go
[1:49:51] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:49:53] to Every Creature he that believeth and
[1:49:55] is baptized wait yes he that believeth
[1:49:59] in is baptized shall be saved but he
[1:50:01] that believeth not shall be damned and
[1:50:03] these signs shall follow them that
[1:50:04] believe he's not talking about just to
[1:50:06] the apostles or just to the prophet
[1:50:09] messenger he's talking to them that
[1:50:10] believe who believes remember I said
[1:50:13] before I've read it quite a few quotes
[1:50:15] when the weakest of Christians gets on
[1:50:17] their knees the kingdom of Hell shakes
[1:50:19] when the weak kissed so it doesn't
[1:50:21] matter so oh so now there's now there's
[1:50:23] only two so you say who's a Believer
[1:50:26] who's a Believer this morning is
[1:50:28] everyone a Believer so therefore you're
[1:50:30] a Christian right so it doesn't matter
[1:50:32] if you consider yourself a weak
[1:50:34] Christian or a strong Christian he says
[1:50:36] when the weakest of Christians gets on
[1:50:38] their knees and prays the kingdom of
[1:50:40] Hell shakes Devils
[1:50:41] tremble amen so doesn't matter what you
[1:50:44] think you are I'd
[1:50:46] pray amen who wants to see hell come
[1:50:49] down hallelujah hallelujah now he that
[1:50:52] believeth okay and these Sons shall
[1:50:54] follow them that believe in my name they
[1:50:56] shall cast out Devils they shall speak
[1:50:58] with new tongues they shall take up
[1:51:00] serpents if they drink any deadly thing
[1:51:02] it shall not hurt them and they shall
[1:51:03] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:51:06] recover amen these shines shall follow
[1:51:10] you now you don't have to do a tick box
[1:51:12] have I fulfilled it's God's life in you
[1:51:15] lives
[1:51:16] this amen you say well I don't feel a
[1:51:19] lot of Faith take God at his word we
[1:51:22] don't live by feeling we do not walk by
[1:51:25] feeling right we know you know I am
[1:51:28] quite an emotional person but when it's
[1:51:30] all said and down I do not walk with God
[1:51:32] because of
[1:51:34] emotion I walk with him because his word
[1:51:36] says it I believe it that settles it I
[1:51:38] may not understand it I'm not worried
[1:51:40] about understanding it at this time he
[1:51:42] will show me what it means in my season
[1:51:45] that's right right so this is the
[1:51:47] standing orders of the day and so if
[1:51:49] this is the
[1:51:50] case we are made worthy to do these
[1:51:53] things now that doesn't mean you go to a
[1:51:55] snake dance and do all those things no
[1:51:57] just walk with
[1:51:59] God you mean my faith yes your
[1:52:02] faith lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:52:04] recover they'll cast out Devils speak
[1:52:07] with new tongues they'll do these things
[1:52:10] hello Believers we are called to believe
[1:52:13] all things are
[1:52:14] possible amen and we remember this is a
[1:52:17] spiritual walk this life doesn't matter
[1:52:20] if you doesn't matter about the atheist
[1:52:21] on the street it's still a spiritual
[1:52:23] world this world it's like a you know
[1:52:26] the light spectrum we see this much but
[1:52:28] the spectrum is this big it's the same
[1:52:30] thing with this natural world we see

[1:52:49] failure is that these hands have done
[1:52:51] and they know the things that they have
[1:52:53] done but don't worry about the things
[1:52:54] they have done are they under the blood
