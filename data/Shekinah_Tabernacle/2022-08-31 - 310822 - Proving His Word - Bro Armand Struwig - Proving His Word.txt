[Music] [Music] but we'll understand [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] will [Music] oh we've been tossed and driven round on the reckless season of time from the skies and howling tempers off succeed of bright sunshine in that land of perfect days [Music] when the morning comes when all the [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] by [Music] we have a we have a presentation um by sister maggie so we can all be seated thank you um i don't know if i'm allowed to do this but can i ask the musicians to be dismissed so then you guys can watch too so as you all know um the youth went on a snow trip um just last um last sunday we went um and i just wanted to ask everyone that went to the snow trip could just stand up and so then everyone knows who who went our youngest youth just shannon isaac over there so um as you can see on the first slide that's um all of us that was there minus the tauranga crew that left the night before so we had representatives from wellington tauranga fielding taranaki and we've got one from auckland as well so it was a north island gathering um so to the far right over there is where our lodge is located which is the same place we stayed last year with the dub was it the dove snow trip um this one works so this is our um upstairs lodge um it comfortably fitted 21 of us and it felt a lot more full compared to the little kids last year but um that was it was good that those two that room there acted as our lounge kitchen games room and church so there was heaps going on um and we had um four brothers minister for us while we were away we had brother isaac brother aori from taranaki brother ben came all the way up on wednesday night and stayed for a bit and then left the same night back to wellington um and then we had dave minister for us too um and we as it says here we had lots of gospel widening worship so this works [Music] [Applause] um we also had quite a few musical talents spring forth that we didn't know about um the fielding duo um surprised us with some impromptu piano playing um as you'll see in this video [Music] he really came [Music] um then on monday the main event was um a snow day or a lack of it there wasn't that much snow the first day so only happy valley was open but um that meant that all the lessons could get done and dusted differences could be resolved during the snow war as you can kind of see there um and we could practice our jumps as you'll see in the next few videos so this is michael got a commentary from isaac and a few of them namski thank you um we then had the opportunity to go up to the at the gondola um so isaac and shannon selfishly claimed a gondola to themselves for obvious reasons um and we went up the top and had a head a snowball fight and hannah got her cheek completely like bruised from abe's close range firing but no it was really awesome and then we've got a few more videos nice nice um our arrival on the monday was a bit sleety um but that cleared up by lunch isaac is there showing us that real men don't stop for ham sandwiches they just keep snowboarding um then tuesday was a oh no sorry there's more videos and then it's just i think this might be essay and he's safe [Music] and then the next one is abi abe did not have a lesson and last year he did he's killing so he was doing real awesome on the snowboard [Music] so tuesday was our um sightseeing day it was a two-hour loop track to taranaki falls which left us pretty knackered um we just returned and i just sat down with a kulkum butcher and then isaac and ben come running up the stairs saying we're going to the turf to play some games and so we all trudged down to the vans and went down to the turf that's next to the chateau for some some games um which you oh and that's that's john at the top there um and then play some games i'm sorry tiana to do this to you but you kind of yell on this one so that's tongariro um you can just see in the distance it was a beautiful day um and then we go to wednesday wednesday was wicked it was so cool that's um up up the real that's the top of the mountain so if you were to look right you would see that your eye level with tongariro so you i'd never been up that high before um so as either ski at happy valley or ski at the top tracks which was a matter of go hard or go home the tea bars were quite new to some people but so you either conquered the tea bars or you were conquered by them my brother eddie in was annihilated by one of the top jumps and went home with a broken arm and a life lesson after land on your feet not your hands asaph got very comfortable with a boulder when we're nearly going off the edge of the mountain um and 360s were done some intentional but not all um overall it was a really solid day of skiing and snowboarding we were there from i think 9 30 through to 4 o'clock so it was non-stop this is um the lunch prep for that day it's nice to see the brothers in the kitchen um even if it looks like ben's about to sneeze on the sandwiches but there's pre-destinated dnase it's okay and it looks like john is just taste testing um and so some friendly fire if it works that's okay that was just a snowball bent on um and this is our well naomi and ben's efficiency in the kitchen and a note to tell the little ones not to do that when nothing yeah um and yeah so this is um our final slide so it's just a bit of a big thank you um i'll let you guys read that in your own time but um overall it was a real awesome trip and and i thank you all for making it happen and being there it was it was really great so um [Music] to reject this world [Music] let us [Music] cool so thank you everyone i mean um if we could all stand to our feet and slow slow service down a little bit um lord i give you my heart [Music] lord i give you my heart i give you my soul [Music] every breath that i take every moment [Music] lord i give you lord i give you my heart i give you my soul [Music] [Applause] this is [Music] with all my [Music] lord i give you [Music] with is [Music] [Music] [Music] lord i give you my heart lord i give you my heart and i give you my soul i live for you alone every breath that i take [Music] every moment time away lord have your way lord i give you lord i give you my heart i give you my soul i live for you alone every breath that i take any more [Music] lord i give you lord i give you my heart give you my soul i live for you alone every breath that i [Music] lord i give you lord i give you my heart i give you my soul [Music] and i live for you alone every birth that i take [Music] every moment i'm awake [Music] the lord has your [Music] you make me more like this jesus [Music] give me a heart that's filled with love and make me more light will make me more like this [Music] give me [Music] amen let's just sing that again hallelujah and make me more like thee [Music] jesus make me more like me and give me [Music] and make [Music] oh gracious heavenly father we come here lord humbly tonight father and ask make us more like you lord that's our heart's greatest desire lord is not to be some superhero lord or to try to be something fancy father but just someone that is walking in the image of the lord jesus christ lord where they can say on this earth there is still jesus christ in flesh lord that if these people out there looking for you father that they would see you in us lord so ask that you would make us more like you lord jesus there's nothing we can do or or lord we're just sheep we just bear will lord we just ask would you just come in and lord would you just be the one that gives us that wool lord jesus we cannot manufacture it not even if we eat the nicest of food lord can we push out that wool lord but i asked lord jesus that you will just come tonight by our way may you just have a personal meeting with each one of us lord that's why we come father and do not pass us by lord because the whole reason we come here lord is to draw strength father lord to get encouraged lord and if there is a need lord we asked lord that you would just see that need lord we know you already know it lord because predestination proves father that there is nothing nothing nothing on this earth that is a surprise to you lord father and we just ask you take this evening and may you be glorified in our midst father may you take speaker and hear our lord and may this all just be for your kingdom your glory we pray in the wonderful name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen amen sister talia can you put up that second song quickly that we had and verse three i just want to show music you can you can go and sit thank you very much god bless you just something that that it's so wonderful that when we when we come to church the lord's already pre-ordained everything everything is in cater there's nothing that's out of cater there's nothing that's out of sort i think it was the verse where it says um wonder why the test was in there it says lord give no not the second song we sang the the yep there we go so let's see this this is pretty much the whole sermon summed up right here temptations hidden snares often take us unawares and our hearts are made to bleed for some thought word and deed and we wonder why the test we try to do our best what will understand it better by and by amen thank you very much so god bless you saints you can all have you see oh no actually we stand we're going to have a scripture first sorry i almost got ahead of myself let's turn to malachi 4. i wonder who knows what the scripture is all about who knows who wants to raise the end and say i like when the kids malachi 4 what would be in malachi 4 what's very important amen brother ben you win me i'm there amen okay so let's read it and let's see if you can find yourself there everybody there amen it's the last book in the old testament so if you didn't know says phobia verse one for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up say of the lord of host and it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as carves in the storm man we'll be fat and fluffy on the word amen we won't go hungry he says i'll give you all you need you'll be just as calves jumping around amen and you shall treat down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the souls of your feet in that day shall the lord do this save the lord of hosts amen that's god saying that it's not any one of us it's god saying it amen he says remember ye the law of moses my servant which i command unto you and horap for all israel with the statues and judgment behold i will send you amen let's say again behold i will send me elijah the prophet before the coming and the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn my heart from the fathers to the children and the hearts from the children which is now mine back to the fathers least i come and smite the earth with a curse amen god bless you saints have a seat it's not going to be hot and heavy tonight um actually what happened this is the first time i'm preaching without notes because i made heaps of notes and they all kind of went all over the show and i said lord you know what i love you i'm gonna take the scripture that you gave me and and the thought that you gave me and we'll see what you do with that because it's not us doing the work so if you came to listen to me you're gonna be very disappointed because it's not me doing the work it is the lord jesus christ amen amen okay so you can only leave you disappointed if you didn't ask him to help you or bless you because it is the believer that touches the hymn of his garment it's the believer okay amen so my my sermon title tonight is proving his word amen so proving his word god proves his word amen that is that is where it's at there's no other way about it god proves his word no matter how you try to figure it out or try to make it work in your head if god doesn't come and prove it he is not god he is sovereign he is almighty he he's big enough to prove his word anytime anyplace anywhere so children i might ask you a couple of questions just to see if you're awake i think brother munpo does it so very nicely so i'm going to kind of use what he used the thing is i promise you guys you will leave here and you'll be having a very wonderful jubilee if you pull not when i preach it's not about me it's when you pull okay it's a tug of war satan's trying to pull the blessing away from you you need to pull the blessing towards you the only one that's going to work is the one that's doing the pulling if you stop pulling you're going to start losing don't lose ground tonight amen he says brother branham says this improving his word and this is where i got it from so what i did a little bit of background is on my birthday i went and i googled what did brother brandon preach on my birthday which was the 16th of august and he had four sermon titles but one of them really just jumped out i loved all of them one was faith that was the report of the africa trip and and god taught brother branham a real precious lesson in that in that whole event of going to south africa and i said lord let that never happen to me because i don't want to i don't want to go there but all sons of god shall be tried they come to him and so in proving his word it just jumped out because that means it's not me doing it it actually takes the pressure off the believer it takes it off it's not you doing it god will prove his word he's the one doing the work you are the work but he will do it but guess what he will prove his word through you that is the beauty of it that's where it all lies this is the key of why you're a believer unbelievers are unbelievers predestinated god never had him in his plan that is just how god works because when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world god knew where you would be if you would be a believer and when you will be that believer that's god's foreknowledge so if you made your believer and you accept the word that's who you are you are a believer amen don't try to worry about the unbelievers don't try to worry about the ones that walk away don't worry about the ones that's not in the message or outside if just leave them this is for you very personal he gave you the ability to be bright it's nothing you could done he just said marion in you i'm going to put something and that's going to respond to my word for your hour that's it and it's just i placed it there because you know that god gives every man a measure of faith so which means faith comes from yeah and who who gives hearing there okay so where does faith come can you produce five no faith is what lord gives you he gives every man a measure of faith and how you react to the word is going to get you where you need to be he will never trial you above your your fireplace if you do understand it so so you know when you get a limit and you get to that limit you know this is the best of recalls i've got he won't go above your head he will not let you drown but he's definitely going to take you right to the edge okay like like as right to the edge as you humanly possible can go he'll take you there to prove him not to prove you to prove him let's always understand it so now when a trial happens the the the whole attitude of a christian is when something's starting to happen then you turn to him because you know that in that trial no matter what's going to happen god is going to prove his word through you as long as you stay with the word you will be fine don't walk away from the word the whole word not a part of the word not some peace not some the whole word do not walk away from it whatever you do do ever ever walk away from the word because god can only stand for you when you stand on east amen so i hope you'll get it it's very simple i'm not going to go very deep tonight i'm going to be afrikaan say we're just going to go here okay because what i think is everyone lives and we're all alive for real-life christians hey we we live every day for god we love god we we absolutely just want to please him with everything we do i see little faith all she wants to do is please us man everything she wants to do is just please us that's a little child they just want to please mommy and daddy anna lisa am i right so you you don't really like when your mom and dad is angry with you hey or when they come around the corner and they've got that annalise voice analyst what's your second name beatrice man if they throw that name out now we're in trouble because liam stein we thought he's just liam stein permanently but he knows when stain is added to the name this is now serious so no no child wants that and i don't want god to come to me and say armant arnold you know i don't want him to come to my and it's not my second name but i don't want god to come to me and really address me and and be disappointed in me i want to please god because there's something in me that really wants to please him i i want to please him but you know as much as i want to please him i will still fail in my in this human flesh so that's why i need him to say lord remove armand out the way so that you can come in and you can work through me because the moment i get out of the way it doesn't matter what happens you will prove your word amen so let's go there to mark mark 5 and verse 20 22. so all your bible readers grab your swords we're going to go on a journey who knows what's in mark 5 22. okay let's not go to 22 let's just say mark 5 we've got jesus walking and legion runs up to to jesus and he pretty much says falls at his feet have mercy okay so so here is a here is the and i'm just going to build something here this in mark 5. man a lot of things happen here and when i read the scripture i thought whoa man we serve a mighty god we really serve a mighty god no one could bound this guy they couldn't bind this guy he was off his rocker man he was all over the show comes to jesus and jesus cast out a thousand demons there you go a legion okay just by gone but then it comes to this part now it comes to this part and he says now after this event happened verse 22 oh let's go verse 21 and when jesus was passed over again to the ship to the other side people gathered unto him and and he was knight to unto the sea and behold there cometh one the ruler of a synagogue uh jairus by the name and when he saw him he fell at his feet now now let's see this is a this is they said the ruler of the just keep the slides up but don't don't take them down the ruler of a synagogue so he was a pastor he was a he was a preacher brother branham picks it up in this and go listen to this proving his word in 64 816 he says he was a pastor of the church the only thing he couldn't do he loved jesus but he couldn't follow jesus because he was scared that the people would put him out the church isn't there many of us at school at work that can't follow jesus with our friends because we're scared our friends will put it put us out of these circles have you thought about it but you know what god's going to do he's going to bring you to a point where you have to choose he's going to take you to that point let's look what jairus happened he was the iris and he says that verse 20 uh 23 now he says um and behold there cometh one a ruler's gyrus and he says and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her and that she may be healed and that she shall live now now remember if he wasn't a believer in jesus christ he wouldn't have gone there you know so see circumstances had him at such a place that that he couldn't go to jesus he you couldn't just proclaim jesus but he had to have a meeting with jesus so his friends was giving him preacher everyone was giving him pressure but he hasn't really had that connection with jesus christ so i'm telling you if you can see the story in parallel with what happens in your own life make it personal put yourself in that scripture if your friends say there's no jesus christ i encourage you to meet him i encourage you to start seeking jesus because when it all gets hot and heavy there is only one only one that can get you out of it only one and that's jesus christ our lord and savior amen now what happens just after this and and i'll paraphrase now this is all going on and 24 24 says and jesus went to him oh wait yeah and much people um followed him and and turned uh and throned him so a lot of people and a certain woman with a blood issue of 12 years now now this lady comes on the scene now i'm thinking jesus is now busy talking to jairus and he's having a conversation and this lady while he's now busy walking through everyone and he's going to jairus house to go and lay his hands upon his daughter now this lady comes in the scene and and this is what strikes me so now remember legion god shows his power okay but nobody here saw it that was that was between him and legion and he cast out those demons then here comes jairus just lay your hands upon my daughter she'll be fine so he has faith and now this lady comes and she goes beyond that she goes if i just touch him she's not saying lay your hands on me she's not saying you can heal me and she doesn't go lord come and put your hands on me and pray this massive praise he says i only want to touch his hymn of his garment i'll be healed so that's faith so everybody has a measure of faith so so jairus has never really experienced this and he's around there when this event happens and jesus stops and he turns around and he says who touched me and now remember he's now a witness he is there and he sees this event happening and now what happens she gets healed and he says you are healed and if we drop down we're going to go now the two verse um i just want to get yeah i did make a note of that just hold on d we're going to drop down the two verse 22 and then he says he had suffered many things was physicians and straightway the fountain of blood was dried up so that's verse 29 and she felt the body that he she was healed of the plague and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue has gone from him turned about into the priest and said who touched my clothes okay and then he said to her we drop down to verse 34 and then he said unto her daughter thy faith has made the whole go in peace and behold of thy plague amen now this has just happened now now jairus is standing by jesus and now a servant runs towards him and he's got ashes on his head because in those days when people die they throw ashes on the head and he and he pretty much comes to jesus and and brother branham picks it up here and this is where it really got real for me and he says no no don't don't bother the master your daughter is dead so if we can go the he says just the next verse um let's go i'll just tell you verse 35 and while he yet spake they came forth the ruler of the synagogue house a certain which said thy daughter is dead why troubles thou the master and as soon as jesus heard that now now just think about it now that dad has just heard his daughter died so he had faith enough to come to jesus and say hey lord just just come and lay your hands upon him just pray for her and here comes the report after all this he just seen and they say your daughter died how would he have felt it would have shaken him as a dad it would shake you when you know your daughter has died but jesus he said he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only belief that's all he said there are prophets say only believe all things are possible the same god now remember god made that promise jesus christ said only believe all things are possible now jesus is going to have to prove his word in this whole scenario because he said only believe so we carry on next verse he says and he suffered no man to follow him save peter james and john and the brother of james so he says to them let's go all of you stay let's go next one he says and then he cometh into the house of the ruler of the synagogue and see as the the tumult so tumult is they were crying and they were wailing and it was all just everywhere and a big mess and people were sad because it's a child that died and they wept and they wailed greatly next verse he says and when he was come in he saith unto them why do you make this ado and weep so now listen they're weeping for this dead lady and jesus walks in and goes what's going on here why are you crying oh what's wrong here she's only sleeping she's only sleeping now remember i want to bring this to you saints cannot die we cannot die we can sleep if god is done with you and you finished your work here on earth and you should pass to the to the to the other through the veil you will sleep you will not die because you're a believer a believer cannot die and the scripture for it if you don't believe in we all know this but we've got multiple scriptures for that it says here if we go to 1 thessalonians and four it says from verse 14 just keep that scripture just there i'll go to thessalonians is four if we believe that jesus died and rose again and when them also which sleep in jesus will go bring will god bring with him for this we say unto him to you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep saints don't die okay so so we don't need to wail we don't need to cry god has the final say if he wants to raise someone from the dead he'll do it if he wants to keep them down he'll do it it is god's work we are believers and we just say be it unto me according to your will that's what we do god proves his word next next one please say sister he says and they laughed and they scorned him loved him to scorn so they laugh at jesus christ mighty god on earth telling them that she's just sleeping and they are unbelievers so what does he do sends them out the room so if if people leave yes where it comes a bit personal if people leave if they've been sent out of the room who did the work you no if people take offense and they go somewhere else who did they leave who pushed them out you no it doesn't work that way no matter what you say if you're a believer you will take it back to god this is where it's this is where the rubber hits the road if you're a believer does not matter what happens with you does not matter what people say to you does not matter what is gossip and all those things you walk right through it because you're a believer it does not affect you it has nothing to do with you okay you don't try to fight creeds and dogmas and try to justify the word and everything you do has to be a justification and if it doesn't it's not in your revelation then you walk away with it you're a believer you're a sheep you bear will you just say bar but god put it in you you're just a believer so if you do take offense i encourage you take it back to the one that is offending you not the brother that spoke the word or the sister take it to the one because god is the one that's going to prove you in that fire there was four men in the fire okay three got thrown in and then the guys that threw them in burned right in front of that fireplace okay now here's malachi 4 for me so they go into the fire but they say to this big king a group or whatever say lord so it's fine if if if god if god wants to deliver what's it what was his name what was that king nebuchadnezzar sorry i smacked it so he goes and they say to him say oh great king you know live forever you know and i think i got it right now and he says if god deliver us from this amen but if god doesn't deliver us from us amen who's doing the work god made the promise say i can and i will but i want you just to walk into the fire so guess what they don't even walk in they got thrown in because poor hands and feet and everything is tied just to make sure they don't escape and then these two fall right at the front of the fire and they dead and they have a wonderful jubilee in the fire because god comes down and says i got this i got this okay not the three had it i got this have a massive jubilee nice fellowship and sends them out again and they walk over the ashes of the ones that threw them in amen it was a hot fire seven times harder they should have been ashes by that fireplace and i take it if you didn't burn in the fire you would have been in there a long time because it didn't affect you anyways it was you know so if you're in a trial for seven years or that's a hotter than hot trial and you think you can't make it that's that's the devil is trying to say you're not a believer we don't have a choice we're going to make it there's going to be a rapture i'm going to walk right up brother isaac into a body change what inspired him to write that song and who did he write the song for for me so when he started singing that song this when we sang it and i thought poor brother isaac he was he was like we were so slow and he's like come on speed it up and he's trying and i'm thinking but don't worry we got the message brother isaac that's all that matters no matter how slow we're gonna walk into heaven we are gonna walk into heaven okay so don't worry about the details just think about the promise amen okay but i could see i could see really he was really trying to push us only but we were right on time amen i love brother isaac god bless you brother isaac keep writing those songs they fool the bride so let's go back and he says okay so he loved him and then he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and him that was with him and he entered in where the damsel was laying next verse and then he looked at the damsel i took the dancer by the hand and he sayeth unto her now i don't know how to say it's nice but which means being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise okay just hold it there so who was proving his word yeah you know that jarius had that he had to come there and and work up his faith did he have to come and say you know oh god great god you can do it and did he have to do anything else but just stand there and say he [Music] but god said i'm taking a rapture there's no rapture but he said so you can't overcome he said so okay you're not a believer sorry he said so you can't you can't defeat cancer he said so you can't be healed he said so you know you're never gonna make it sorry he said i'm gonna make it see the whole thing is all the pressure goes on him he has to prove his word you cannot prove it even if you work yourself into the the biggest uproar you can and the most dancing around and jumping and doing everything you cannot do it he will only do it when you say lord i'll stand here on your word and i need you to prove it so the preacher is off the believer he said so amen let's go next verse and guess what happened and straightway the damsel arose and she walked hello and she was of the age of 12 years now remember that lady had a blood issue of 12 years god doesn't make things happen for no reason he loves his numbers okay he loves his numbers now i want to tell you you can take that off now i'm just going to i'm going to close because i said i'm not going to be long tonight the whole point is let off the pressure you cannot figure it out how many of us are feeding off the word daily if you want to win eat if you're not eating you'll look like ethiopian and you will die they are if you've ever gone to ethiopia those people don't eat they don't have food they look in a terrible state and the moment you look at them you can see they are in a really bad place if you don't eat you die if you're not listening to the message if you're not reading your bible if you're not praying god cannot come on the scene for you because you're actually not going and standing on his word because you don't know his word isn't this supposed to be a love letter isn't this opposed to where you find yourself you know it's is when you get to a situation i remember working for brother i um andy and brother isaac man these guys they just operate different they said no we're here in the scripture at this moment and i go hey because remember i was still a young believer then just came into the fellowship they said no god is saying this is our season which we are in and i'm thinking how can you say that like how do you see that but brother and it's just where he is you showed me this is the scripture we're moving on and that was that time where you got that massive testimony where they wanted to take your business you know and you just said no this is where we're standing god made these businesses i will stand and this is where we are and brother i will never forget it the first first bible study the thing we had is said what's your favorite scripture and i walked in i said exodus 14 14. i the lord shall fight with you you showed your peace remember that and he goes ah cool and they were going through the fight i didn't have no idea what they were going through they didn't have to tell me but they knew we were the standing on the word in time do you know that do you know that that's where you can find yourself every day the thing is you don't find yourself where you're standing and which character you could be you could be david you could be solomon you know you could be in any season you could be a mighty prophet where where you say elijah where you stand on my caramel and people are challenging and you go lord you need to answer by fire now you could be there but see even if you in that type god wants to answer by fire not you but he's going to put you in that place because he wants to let the whole world see is what i did for elijah what i did for david i can do for you and you and you and in the midst of your battles no matter if nobody has unbelief it is for you and i will prove you i will not let your words fall to the ground no matter what happens your words shall not fall to the ground as long as you stay on my word so again i'm going to close musicians can come up we're going to have a prayer meeting by the way musicians come up i just want to sing one song this does not need to be so long i want to tell you living for christ is not a big thing living for christ is your everything amen amen just see it where it is it's your everything we have no option b a believer doesn't have the only b we have is for believer okay that's the only option b we have so if option ao a fails then option b believer comes in okay so if i don't see another option then option c comes in which is christ confirming his word okay you can take that's free of the priest okay that's the lord but when your options end that's when god comes in but i'm telling you if you find yourself walking within the pages of his word then you will know where you're standing and you will know when god will stand for you amen amen let's sing only believe all brother sister stand up we're gonna we're gonna sing the song only believe it doesn't need to be long brothers and sisters but what i want you to realize tonight it doesn't matter if we're here for five hours or for ten hours why are we here amen if there's anyone here tonight that has a prayer request you don't need to come forward all i want you to do is only believe if you children has a challenge at school and and people are coming and they they're giving you a hard time because you can play only believe and they're giving you a hard time and you feel like hey god's not maybe fighting for you only believe there is no plan b you're a believer god has the plans amen when you don't understand why trial is so hard don't worry about it let off the pressure just believe okay and if you do not believe then ask christ to come in and help you that's as hard as this should be now look at jairus jairus came to god with a sincere heart and he really believed he didn't work himself up when the report came back god came on the scene jesus said let's go i'm gonna go healer the people laughed him out in the house even when the almighty christ was in that place they laughed our king out what did he do didn't phase him a bit he just said i believe amen so tonight i ask you we all can pray together but let's just sing the song and then we'll go into a a little bit of a prayer meeting tonight and you talk to god and when you talk to god you ask him where you're in a need let him come down and take that knee if your plan a has failed go to plan believer and if your plan believer is felt go to plant christ okay and if you feel that you can't see yourself in these pages ask him to reveal himself within these pages amen so let's just sing the song only believe oh only believe only believe all things are possible all things amen all things are possible amen [Music] [Music] only believe all things are possible only be sing it again only believe [Music] believe [Music] all things are possible only be [Music] and only [Music] believe all things are possible only believe just bow your heads now and close your eyes musicians just keep playing he says and i said here you are for a reason you are walking the way you are both knees have broke i said this was a lady in a prayer line if this should help your faith the lord just said to read it and i'm gonna read it that's the cause by a car accident in a car that you were driving four years ago and she said that's true i said your doctor is a little short fellow bald-headed and he wears glasses he said that's right he says i said he's doctoring because that the knees are broke and become tubercular and even the flesh is rotting around the bone she said that's right and she said is there a hope for me i said it depends what your approach is to the lord jesus she said can you help me i said no ma'am no one can help you now but you have to help yourself to god's provided blessing for you and she said i now believe with all my heart and i said the lord heal you sister it's thus save the lord and you are healed and she said mr branham i haven't been to kneel she said for four years while weeping standing there rubbing her hands and a great audience people weeping watching her lutherans presbyterians and she said why don't you go down i said why don't you go down at the altar on your knees now and she said let me kneel right here right where i am healed and she never moved from those steps but she was healed and she took her place and she knew that there was nothing else to guess about she said i'll kneel down and she knelt down and for the first time in four years with both knees broke and all clauses over made over her bones together that woman like a young woman knelt to her knees and the tears were streaming from her cheeks raised up her hands to god just raised them all up and said it's easy like a little girl and she tiptoed off the platform was what was that god had it were that way now he's seen doctors that's right and doctors are fine and they can do only what they can do but god had made a way that's it see after doctor has failed in his way god makes a way so much higher than our way isn't that a wonderful thing hallelujah let's just go into a word of prayer tonight you talk to the mighty savior and say lord jesus i come to you tonight father and on the basis of time and again lord where you proved your word time and again father where lord jesus the prophet of god said i cannot heal no one it is you father that's already done it and if thou canst believe all things are possible lord if there is a need tonight father we ask in the name of our lord jesus christ the same god yesterday today and forever may you come into this prayer meeting tonight lord jesus may you touch us lord jesus may we touch the hem of your garment father lord if there is a spirit that is besiding us lord if there is an unconfessed sin between us and you lord jesus our lord jesus may we just confess it and lord may you come down in a mighty way right here and touch us lord i believe no matter what i'm told no matter how it seems no matter what it costs i believe and if i look in it seems like it's broken [Music] i'll lay a
