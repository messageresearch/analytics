[Music] foreign [Music] welcome to the house of God this morning it's good to be here and um what are we musicians what were we told on Wednesday priests amen and our priestesses was that a right were we allowed to say that I guess so Brother Andy Prince an awesome message on Sunday uh Wednesday and it was about war you know getting in an atmosphere of war and and it's so true when you start to read the scriptures that anytime the Israelites would win a battle it's because they it was more than just they went out there with a sword and they had skills and they could try and attack the enemy and have strategy that wasn't what caused them to win the battle it was that the Lord told him they were going to win and they they they encouraged themselves in the law they went forth with singing and praise and there was an atmosphere and that's what made them win not this girl yeah although they had to go out and fight but it was a different atmosphere that they fought in you know we there's a natural way you can try and approach your Christian walk but you know that's that's not that's just uh I hope this works I think this will work a positive thinking what sometimes does work now and then because there is a there is truth and the word of God that anyone anyone by Faith Can can attain that that promise right but but we don't want that we want to get in the atmosphere of the spirit of God and approach things by faith and bear that atmosphere so our job here this morning is to uh what's the music to get us in the atmosphere that we're ready for war amen and we're going to overcome every enemy by faith that that tries to come upon us so let's um let's stand this morning and let's invite the Lord to be here and sing some songs of praise and worship this morning heavenly father it's a great a great thing to have the opportunity to be here this morning Lord to be gathered to be able to worship and praise you for all that you've done in our life our lives Lord and and thank you Lord that we're all here by your Divine Purpose Lord that nothing is an accident Lord you're you're too great for all that you're too great for there just to be random chances Lord but you're the almighty God that knows each time a flea would bat its eye Lord that that your Divine Purpose has called each one of us here this morning and we we come here rejoicing and thanking you for that Lord and we desire that you would meet with us in a powerful way Lord may may every heart here be changed this morning Lord Jesus May every life be refreshed and renewed in the Holy ghostly bless the songs bless the singing Lord may we may we create the atmosphere that we could walk in faith this morning bless the word anoint brother Benassi brings the word may we receive it as being from you Lord that way we will receive what you have for us may we look Beyond a man Lord and just see you delivering us the word this morning in due season Lord and we want to pull on that word and just be re refreshed and enriched this morning so we just commit the service to you bless those that um couldn't be here and we just look forward to meeting with you this morning Lord in Jesus name amen amen praise the Lord let's up let's start with um burdens now we're lighter brighter is my way I like happy songs who likes happy songs oh burdens now I like her writer is my way [Music] we'll do the other songs [Music] hey rock song bro hallelujah praise the Lord today I know I'm free please [Music] [Music] Glory Glory Hallelujah praise the Lord today I know I'm free please [Music] [Music] Glory Glory hallelujah praise the Lord today I know I'm free [Music] and if I stay close [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord today I know I'm free please [Music] please [Music] [Applause] amen you free this morning oh yeah just confess it that's why singing is so important because we confess these things even if we don't feel like it we just confess it and that's what makes a difference you know that the the the Bible says that the Lord inhabits the Praises of his people amen so if we express the positive word of God that gets inhabited by the spirit of God conversely if you start professing negative things that came from demons from Spirits because that's all that comes from then you'll find that spirit will come on you because that's what you're confessing yeah right so so even if you feel a certain way just confess the other way and you'll find that actually the atmosphere starts to change and you start to then get in the atmosphere of praise and worship amen oh fill my way every day [Music] meetings [Music] [Music] [Music] never die [Music] every day when I will feel my way feel my way every day [Applause] as I walk with the heavens let me go all the while with us [Music] every

Lord hallelujah amen uh just a reminder there's a community foot washing this Wednesday night and that's it amen so let's go to Isaiah 59 and we're going to go to verse 19 again which is going to just um a few things jumped out from this uh scripture here so it's gonna kind of Take A Part Two from um last Sunday and it's also unfortunately sister meet us last Sunday with us she's going back to UNI so God bless you I mean the Lord continue to keep you and use you up there amen I mean so Isaiah 59 and 19. yeah I'm always looking for a screen up there to see when things are up there but it's not there so it's here anyway praise the Lord amen everyone happy today hallelujah amen we long to worship Him amen aren't you glad because of his blood we can amen because of his blood we can worship Him amen so praise the Lord all right there we are amen okay so shall now who is everyone there everyone happy everyone good okay now so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression and Jacob saith the Lord now as for me this is my Covenant with them who's that who's to them well that's the that Zion the bride and and those that turn from transgression and Jacob saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever so that's the Covenant God made with you not what you made with God's what God made with you amen so let's just bow heads in a word of prayer this morning amen if you ever need you just want to raise your hand to the Lord this morning gracious father we thank you so much we can come into your great divine presence once again Lord we want to give you glory Lord Jesus due unto Your Name Lord and you your name is the name above all names Lois so thankful everything has to bow to your name to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so Lord we want to thank you no matter what we're facing we're fighting the troubles we're going through it must bow to your name so dear God I pray first Lord that we would bow to your name so Lord Jesus I pray father Lord that if anyone here has not given their heart to you may they give their heart to you Lord and if anyone here has taken their heart back lord may they give it back to you in the name of Jesus Christ Lord may he touch each life here Lord I pray you would anoint the service Lord in the mighty way Lord we've read your word now Lord now we need you the great author to come and make it live in our hearts so may you anoint not just speak about Hera also Lord also those who may be watching by the way of YouTubers while Lord anoint them be their portion we love you Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to take a bit of a part two from uh from last Sunday we're speaking about God's provision and um and then so we so we looked at last Sunday how the enemy is coming like a flood hell's opened itself upon the Earth but then when the enemy comes in like a flood the Lord raises a standard against him and we know that standard is the anointed word in a people amen so you become actually the standard God racist amen by the power of his blood amen but we want to just look at this yeah yeah it really stood out to me it says and you know you know the you know the Redeemer shall come to Zion now we know that Zion represents the bride of Christ but you know you think about something's got to happen when a king comes into a city I mean something's got to happen when the Redeemer comes now we know that on an age level this is the rapture and everything that's going on in this time but we know on an individual level this is when the king takes up residence in your heart when the Holy Ghost comes in and makes makes your heart his throne amen that's when the Redeemer comes to Zion amen individually so we want to talk about how the how the how the everything God has promised in his word is here right now all power amen all all his promises is everything is here right now for the believer amen we're not looking for we're not looking for uh it to come in the future it's here right now and that's my sermon now we can go home amen that's basically where I'm going in case you're wondering amen that everything we have need of for this Earthly Journey amen for all victories amen for for for the defeat of every enemy in our life it's all here right now All That Heaven is a is upon the Earth right now amen we're not living in a past age where they just had a partial restoration of Truth like the Lutheran H there was a bit of God there but not all of God was there I mean he was restoring but we've come down into this bright age where God has fully restored himself into a people again we have been restored rather amen that we're not looking for more because you know because God has sent his final Messenger to the Earth right there's not an eighth Church age messenger there's no eighth Church age there's just seven and the seventh has come he is he has released the word and there's a people upon the Earth that have received the word and now God is making him the Lord live in those people's lives amen amen so we're in the so when the king tags have residence I'm in Everything Changes in a place old fussing goes fighting ghosts malice goes Strife goes Pride goes insecurities get conquered sin gets conquered everything gets taken subject by the king in the city amen so so I'm so thankful by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the king takes up residence amen hallelujah amen so you know I was thinking I was walking through whitcoulls sometime this week and um you know a phrase came to mind you know when are people find their way because unfortunately this world has Humanity has lost their way you know everyone is right in their own eyes you know everyone everyone thinks they've got it all taken care of and life is all sorted out and you know but but you know sadly people have lost their way but but there's the people upon the Earth that have found their way you know it's not you know because we got to look at now people will throw always into the future of a restoration of a people of all power and authority is being placed in those people's hands and you know you know but but we live in that day you know you know there Comes a Day when people you know when that day becomes today you know it's like we could speak of Christmas or maybe the next maybe our camp are going to have in October you know we'll say now that day we're going to have camp and that that's going to happen in the future but there comes a day when you drive into Forest Lakes and can't begin right so it's like the promises of God everything he has opened in this day it's not for a future time it's for now yes amen so you know brother man would speak in the you know this is this is the opposite of when people find their way when people can't find their way and he speaks about tourists they wander off the road and get into a desert to to pick some flowers then all all of it looks alike and they can't find their way back it says they you know and and before they die they go and see mirages they run to it jump into it they're throwing and they think they're throwing water on them but actually they're strong hot sand on their head and and and and and a long time before death great vultures come and you know but you know so so that's the opposite of people can't find their way but what about you know are people who find their way because we're not tourists right we're not here to pick up souvenirs you know we are the people of the Living God this morning amen so we're not tourists who can't find their way back no but God has brought us back into the right way Hallelujah so you know so I'm not I believe I'm not looking at a people who who have lost their way or haven't found the way I believe I'm looking at people who have found the way God has put them on the right path and if you're not on the right path this morning I pray God puts you on the right path where because the wrong path is is everything we want to do where it's our desires our needs me me me before the word of God that's the wrong way right for the right but but the right way is not my will but thy will be done Lord hey man so now now the Lord Jesus has has turned the people back the original faith of the fathers now this may all be me for very fundamental but I trust it means more to you today I mean because you'd say in Malachi 4 they'd send Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart to the fathers to the children the hearts of the children to their fathers at least I come and smite the Earth's Earth with a curse now we understand from reading in Luke that John the Baptist fulfilled part of the scripture where where the where the angel of God would tell Zechariah I mean I mean yeah uh yeah Zechariah I think it was his um you know John's father that he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready Are People prepared for the Lord so notice the ministry of John was to turn the heart to the fathers to the children it wasn't to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers so he would turn the people's hearts from the traditions of the fathers from the law from from all the Customs living to turn their hearts to to receive the Messiah but now we've come back into this day now where where the second part of that scripture would be fulfilled that God would turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers amen now we understand that this has already happened right maybe because because if you realize where you're standing then you can then you can operate from where you're standing you know if you think you're in Egypt then you'll be living as an Egyptian right but if you realize you're in the promised land that God has placed you in every Divine promise of God then you'll live according to the place you live that's right I mean so if we realize that all power everything that God is is now poured into the church right now I'm making some announcements this morning see many times you put it off for the future one day the bride will have power one day the bride will overcome one day the devil will be under our feet no that's today that's that that's right now it doesn't matter how you feel about yourself whatever's going on in this it doesn't change what God has done for you amen so if we can stand on what God has done for us then we can stand in that position and overcome praise the Lord amen so you know we should Rejoice this morning amen see see we're not led to a mirage but we are led to the inexhaustible Fountain of Life himself amen the Lord Jesus Christ where we can drink and drink and drink and just rejoice Hallelujah now Brother Bear makes a statement and this is from the church age book he says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word announcements so remember that word is more than ink on paper that's the Living God himself creator of heavens and earth in our midst amen so wonderful being impressed by him enough I'm just changing how you know has it impacted Our Lives enough to realize that the God who made all things is not just with us but he's in us he's not just Emmanuel God With Us but he's God in us amen Christ in you the hope of glory I wonder if this has impressed us enough amen that he's brought us back to the right way Amy Says now let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first John 5 14 we're told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him now how now how do we ask what is the will of God there's only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God Lamentations 3 37 who is he that saith and it cometh the past when the law commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition to ask unless it's in his name there it is again Jesus the name is the word the will you can't separate God and the word they are one now then this word is Left Behind on the printed page as a part of him when you accept it by faith into a Spirit-filled life he said that his word was live John 6 63 the B power the verse that is exactly what he is John 14 6 I am the way the truth and the life Romans 8 and 9 the B part says if any man have not the spirit of Christ is none of his there it is he is the spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that's exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man now I trust this next phrase he said he's talking about me so it's not just men it's women too boys and girls so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man or woman boy or girl in faith takes the word into their heart and places it upon their lips why it is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man Hallelujah so Satan can't stand before you he'll try sure he'll try everything he can but he can't stand before you amen he'll be defeated as much as he was in the wilderness by the Lord Jesus as he will be in your life I mean because remember the Lord Jesus he could have used his great power on the enemy and in The Temptations in the desert but he used the word amen to show to us that speaking the word against the enemy has the power in it to defeat his every move I'm so glad the Lord put it that way it means that means even if we feel weak in faith we don't feel like we're much of a Christian we can quote the word in faith believing it has the power in it to defeat the Devil any place anywhere anytime amen so I think if we start quoting the promises of God at the at our enemy many times we'll quote them out God say Lord you said this in your word this is what you've promised for me but it's good to actually quote it back to the enemy too Satan my God made this Covenant with me I'm going to tell you what God the arrangements God has made with me and then I'm going to tell you the arrangements God has made with you not that you need reminding because he told you to to amen and then you'll find he won't hang around you too much [Music] Hallelujah it's good to always speak those things now praise the Lord now so if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the Living Word and the admits the power of God would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word in faith we can say without a doubt that the glory of God and the wonderful acts of God will be in her midst again now many people will say well yes when the church returns to the word in faith one day that's going to happen and then God's Gonna pour us Spirit out and we're going to have an incredible time no no the bride has returned we have returned to the word in faith amen we're not returning if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning you have returned to the word and Faith you have arrived amen that the power of God the wonderful acts of God will be in your midst again amen if you have received the Holy Ghost this is see let's not put the promise off in the future one day when the squeeze comes down no no the squeeze is squeezing right the power of the third pull is here right now amen yeah I know Christine will fill in all the details you can ask her later but at our Camp God came down and spoke through her a couple of times to two different people one to us one to his one to was Elizabeth and one and and wonder was was the Sharon here and God spoke and Christine was marbling about this and the Lord said to her this is the third pull and it will it will become more and more it's just more of what we already have manifesting that's where the third pull is I mean it's just a greater measure of what we already have amen yeah I try y'all just give a con you go ask her the testimonies right but God said it's here yes right it's not one day it's here the power of the spoken word is here well one day when the bride gets in her position here we are amen we've lined up with the word of God our hearts all they want is him to live amen we don't want malice we don't want Strife we don't want hatred we don't want Envy we don't want jealousy we don't want anything that's not of God in our lives we just want him to live I mean we just want to have pure heart which is a Simplicity of just nothing between my soul and my savior he is everything to me I want to live for him I want to praise him I want to be a living worship Hallelujah that's what my life should be amen because that's what we want isn't it amen and what does that do that's actually perfect love on display amen if perfect lovers on display then God can take out take our lives and speak through it amen and creation can happen anything can happen amen it's exactly the same as God standing there I don't know how exactly how he still but he said let there be sun moon and stars and and God created something out of nothing Hallelujah and God can that same one because remember we don't serve a Lesser God you know it was amazing when I was looking at this you know you know I you know I went on my computer and I and I and I um put you know Isaiah 59 that we just read into my notes and I was reading it and and it said and a redeemer will come to Zion although something's not quite right here this doesn't sound right to me and then it said in the previous verse so they shall fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun for he will come like a rushing stream at which the wind of the Lord drives I thought hold on what what what version am I reading it's not the King James version it was the English Standard Version because I look at different things but yeah but but when I put that down just that verse 20 and a redeemer will come to Zion no no he's not a redeemer he's the Redeemer I mean like we read there in the King James and the Redeemer shall come to Zion he's not a redeemer he is the king of kings and Lord of lords he is the Redeemer he is the Alpha and Omega he is the all sufficient one he's the all-powerful one so when when we realize when the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is not a Lesser God he's not a second person of a godhead you know he's not lit no he is the god the Creator himself the Lord Of Glory steps in and dwells in you hello that's why when when you know you feel lit you're in faith you take the word of God speak it across your lips it's the same as deity speaking amen irrespective of how you feel you can feel as dead as a post but faith is not a feeling amen faith is a faith it's a revelation this word is true amen amen God is able to perform this more than Abel amen we can take any promise of God and quote it to God and believe that God will answer in his good time according to his good pleasure amen because many times we pray something we don't see an answer we begin to doubt our prayer you've got to have confidence in what you've prayed right like God believed his own word and here we are living because he believed his own word when he said that there'll be sun moon and stars amen so when you pray you've got to believe God here's my prayer because of his blood there's no Chasm between me and God anymore I'm a redeemed son or daughter of God on the other side of the chasm and perfect fellowship with God hallelujah and he hears my prince hallelujah amen so in my opinion the bride is not returning to the word and Faith she has returned amen we have arrived amen we're not looking for another something in the future no it's right now remember the third pull is here it's been identified Among Us right not on the other side of the world so it's been identified in this place amen amen and it will get greater and greater I believe that amen I believe God's creative power will speak in a greater measure Hallelujah because this is this is where we're living see see God see what I love about God is he is he loves to show the power of his salvation amen he loves to show the power of his blood amen when he died and he said it is finished Amen in his mind he knew it's done I have bridged the Gulf I have released my Holy Ghost now upon the earth I have I have released the power the power that will cleanse a person's heart my Fallen children will no longer be fallen anymore thou will be redeemed they will be made in my image amen they'll be perfect Fellowship between me and them like with Mia I have with Adam and Eve amen there'll be nothing between me and them though they're in Fallen bodies they will walk with me and overcome in Fallen bodies where Adam and Eve were in perfect bodies but they fell hey man that's the power of His Redemption Hallelujah that we can walk with our frailties our Humanity our problems all these things you look at the man in the mirror I do I say I don't like this person I see I get frustrated with them I get I get anointed as personality and all these different things but yet God said no I will show you my victory in your life amen irrespective of of of this guy I will show the power of the blood amen and that is what this message has come to do to show the power of the blood it's more than just being forgiven amen no it's being justified as Brother David Tyler preached there any you know you know Easter time that we're not just a pardon people no we never did it in the first place Hallelujah but there's a power on that amen that is incredibly wonderful if I can just find the quote of it here God and simplicity if you don't mind the mind the reading he says now it says but God sent down from heaven a bleach for sin it was the blood of his own son now when our confession drops into God's bleach try and find it again the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators and down through the time until it hits the accuser Satan lays on him till the day of judgment what happens to the Sun so what happens to you and I because that's all very wonderful that that happens to the devil and the church said amen wow okay we need to stand up we need to sing a song hey man stand okay so what happens to the sun he becomes infer and perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against him no more there's no more stain of bleach can be seen anywhere he's free Hallelujah just as that Clorox or that ink can never be Inked no more because it broke up and was sent back again and when confessed Sinners confessed and dipped a man or woman that's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms it kills all symptoms of sin it kills all symptoms of unbelief malice Pride Strife whatever it be holding grudges unforgiveness business whatever it is it kills all symptoms praise the Lord Hallelujah and every molecule of sun goes back to the devil and laid on him to the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into a lake of fire and the chasm is bridged and never to come in remembrance no more and a man's down stands Justified as a Son of God Simplicity now he says Moses under the blood of bulls and goats with with his confession in the word of God and God could take that simple man and put his words in his mouth and he proved that he was Jehovah's servant for he could walk out there and Jehovah spoke to him by vision and he walked out stretched out his hands towards the east and now remember God had spoke to him it's God's thought God uses man God spoke to him that's right he said go stretch stretch that rod in your hand towards the east and say flies Moses under the blood of that goat sheep walked out there and took that stick reached towards the east thus saith the Lord let there be flies never heard a fly walked on back it's already spoke it's a thought now it spoke it's expressed it's the word of God then it come into a human's lips and a simple man under the blood a bull a bull or a goat first thing you know a green fly began to fly around next thing you know they were five pounds per yard what was it it was the word of God spoken through Moses the Creator because under the blood he was standing in the prince of God in his own words wasn't his word he says if ye abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be given to you where is the church standing at Amen Let There Be frogs and there wasn't a frog in the country in an hour's time they were they were 10 foot deep in places what was it it was God the Creator hiding himself and a simple man now I want to ask you something of the blood or a bull or a goat can be used for a bleach that could only cover could put a man in a position to speak the creative word of God and bring flies into existence why would you stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ but there would speak a squirrel or something into existence I mean so if a man under the blood of bull you just think about it Moses still had a fall of nature he was still his his sins were just covered there was not a power and a blood or a bull or goat to change his nature like the blood of Jesus Christ changes ours but yet he was walking according to the word of God he was answered to prophecy and he walked into Egypt he said let my people go and whatever came out of his mouth wasn't him speaking but it was God speaking that God would so poor his wrath out upon the gods of the Egyptians and prove his power to bring a total Deliverance to the people of Israel now God can do that under the blood of bulls and goats friends how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ under the blood of Jesus Christ amen it doesn't just cover our sin it changes our nature it takes our sins away amen how much more people right now where is the church standing at I mean where are we standing at right now what condition has God put us in see it's not us putting ourselves in that condition saying I'm going to be sinless I'm going to be perfect no it's God's predestination amen his predestinated grace to you has called you to his side change your nature washed all your sins away amen that you it's the same as he speaking the same as you speaking I mean when God speaks and then you speak the same thing what it's like him speaking what condition ought to we to be at amen that's your takeaway all worry it's your takeaway all fair you say well God hasn't done much in my life what do you believe the word of God Amen do you believe this message says God turned your heart back to the faith of the fathers if you believe the word he has God's already done something to you say well I need a supernatural testimony do you have faith in the full word of God it's a supernatural thing amen that it's not a tradition it's not what I was just raised in church my father mother believed this no but he becomes your God Amen he speaks to your heart you want to read his word amen you like to pray you enjoy his presence amen that it's no longer you're not programmed to be this way by man it's actually God getting a hold of your life and out of your free will you give your heart to him amen that is a supernatural work of God aiming to turn someone's heart from unbelief to Faith it actually caught it it's actually caused because the devil's dethroned and God comes in where is the church standing at I mean what condition are we in Hallelujah said no that's why I say we've arrived we're here we're not looking oh one day this will happen wow God's Gonna restore his word he's going to restore our people back no we're here we're here now this is the condition we're in right now doesn't matter how you feel doesn't matter what you think doesn't matter what you're going through what is your heart of hearts tell you I believe I believe something in me says yes Lord your word is true you're more than able to perform it I don't know how you're going to do it the Deep that's his problem God takes care of the details you just take the word in faith don't look at circumstances don't look at problems just take him at his word and watch God come Hallelujah so so we you think about if if Moses I just want to repeat this now because it really strikes me if Moses could could use the creative power of God well God could use him to do all those things split the Red Sea get water from the rock do incredible things how much more you and I how much more you and I remember Israel Israel wasn't all one heart one mind one Accord coming with Moses they weren't all praise God and you know they come to um you know the bitter Waters they didn't say praise the Lord God's Gonna Change the water we're gonna have sweet water to drink and and then they're hungry praise God God's Jehovah Jireh no they were murmuring and complaining but as long as Moses walked with God and he didn't walk with his temper he didn't walk with the fussing of the people he didn't he wasn't consumed by those things then God could use him to meet the people's needs now we're going to look at our families hey we're not all one heart one mind one Accord amen right but God has placed you in a position right that you can be a breach you can stand in the gap for your family amen and you can walk with God that's why we should just love the Lord just love him in every season of your life you may be in the darkest Siberian winter of your life all right just just push your hands through the snow and say hallelujah amen you may be in the summertime just praise God just love him let him take control of your life like like brother Isaac and and Ed and me we're talking about love you know you know how how important love is in a in a church and we should always fight for the love of God that that the devil has nowhere to move you know we should have a millennial condition right now in the church because in the Millennium the devil's bound right he has no one to work through amen so it should be the same thing in in any church or any family there should be such a condition the devil just can't get in amen amen and then if he gets in there's not another spirit for him to cry to help with to get strength you know like brother Brown would preach and you'll be calling out someone's got a cancer or trouble I'm not pointing anyone in particular you know so don't work you know but but then but then it's here dark streak it's another Spirit was crying out for help the other those demons trying to reinforcing themselves see it should be and the church had the enemy because the enemy was try and come in we're humans right we're human we're not we're not Angels right okay we've got a couple of humans here praise the Lord hallelujah right but you see so the devil the devil will try and come in but what do we do with him when he comes right I mean do we take his sides and sympathize with him and agree with them and just you know no or do we do we do we live in such a way that the enemy may come against us but he's just got to bounce off and not to someone else but back to Hell from whence he came from amen where the enemy actually has no he just can't get in yeah he just can't he just can't get a toe hold in anyone's life we can live like that the blood of Jesus Christ causes us to live like that if we stay surrendered to the Lord hallelujah amen he's more than able to do it I mean so Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at people that can live like that yes that's why would you always just let the love of God rule above all things to walk in love as as the Apostle Paul said to the Ephesians amen so now we can the power of the third pool is here hallelujah it's here right this morning amen amen amen we have returned to the word in faith I'm just repeating a few phrases that I've read we have returned to the word and Faith amen we have arrived we have came back Hallelujah amen so now many people will will think well this is in the future but it's right now we're going to realize the season that we're living in you know Israel's Journey from from Egypt into the promised land really parallels this day we live in you know after brother Brown left if you look at church history there's a lot of fussing and fighting among Believers Church splits trouble it was like Israel in the wilderness you know sure God was there God was doing Miracles and things but there was fussing you know false doctrines rose up trouble all these things going on but yet there came a time after that where where Israel went into the Promised Land and possessed everything that God gave them Hallelujah and it's the same thing today after the prophet left fussing fighting trouble those 40 Years of wilderness sure God was there but he was mainly fighting and fussing in church splits but then when you look back at around 2005 which was 40 years from when uh you know after brother Brown went off the scene there was a change of season yep amen it was like we're coming out of winter into Springtime amen where it's no longer we're no longer in the wilderness amen but the bride is crossed Jordan and Is possessing every promise that belongs to us you know I was talking to someone this week and I told them about this and I was saying about you know you know my wife you know you know we know Christine was raised in church and and she said that for the first 20 years of her life the only person she saw received the Holy Ghost was herself is that me amen but you see but now she's seen many now we've seen many people come to the Lord we've seen many people filled with the Holy Ghost many people are going to show just use that one what's here this thing are we good I turned it righty tighty lefty Loosey it's not a gas connection good all right amen but you see but you see now there was a season where not much was going on right but now we live in a different season I mean now we see many people have received the Holy Ghost amen God moves in great power more than he was always there but now it's a different season I mean where the bride has crossed Jordan and has entered into the promised land amen where every Divine promise of God Amen is for the believer amen we're here to possess every Divine promise of God Amen you see we but but we're going to realize this is where we are you know I looked at the quote yesterday this one time brother Brown talks about ducks and he says you know it's like there used to be a time where you know a farm would have ducks in their fences and then another Farm where they have ducks and you know but then but then the water comes and actually lifts the Ducks above the above the fences Amen to see it's just that the blessings of God poor enough I mean it'll raise all the Believers above all the fences and the fussing and the fighting and the and the dogma's in trouble and we realized we're all believers and that's what's happened in this country amen that you know the spirit of God's been pouring in more and more yeah yeah it used to be before 2005 around there you know people would just hear the honking of other believers behind fences and they start you know you know they kind of sound like Believers but I'm not sure this is fits and well those people that that part of this but then now it's a different season why the water's been poured in we've been lifted up above all that stuff and we can't even see where the fences are and we realize actually we're all one body we're all believers I mean we're all being Redeemed by the same blood Amen to the same Lord Jesus purchased our Salvation like anyone else hallelujah amen so what's happening now the water's risen us above the fences now now what's gonna now what's happening now there's a swarming going on there's a swarming going on why there's another change in season what is it Resurrection season rap shower amen this is the season we live in that's why there's a swarming going on Amen that it's not a library anymore in a church but there's a Hallelujah and a praise to God God begins to move what's happening there's a swarming going on I mean not a cold breeze coming upon a pond but a warm breeze of the Holy Ghost floating through the church amen what is that that's a call you're going to come up high soon children I mean you're gonna leave this world Amen why because we live in a different season Hallelujah now it must have been amazing for the disciples they lived through many days where prophecy became history Jesus fulfilled over 300 prophecies in his ministry you know so so there would have been many a week where they could have said this day the scripture is fulfilled amen but they had to you know but took the grace of God for them to actually realize it yeah that's right yeah amen so you know you just take one for example look for when he goes to the um goes to Nazareth he goes to the synagogue and he stands up to read and then you know it was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah you know that was predestinated handing whoever gave in the book was anointed to give them that scroll and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written so he didn't just open and just say I'll read this verse it sounds good he found his particular verse particular scripture and he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he's anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sights of the blind to sit at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and it was given again to the minister and he sat down and in the eyes of all them are in the synagogue were fasted on him and he began to say to them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears so they begin to you know you know it was just like any other synagogue service but Jesus came to synagogue it was Jesus custom to go to church we should too amen and then so he found that scripture he says he says this thing what you see in front of you right now is the Fulfillment of this prophecy that means it was no longer prophecy was becoming history but you think about it let's just take one of those promises there the recovering of the sight to the blind now why something to say a prophecy is here I mean a prophecy is being fulfilled there's nothing for God to come in behind them and say yes that's true Hallelujah because many people claim a lot of things but when God comes down and says yes that's a whole different story I mean that's why that's why the Lord would come and behind the prophet messenger meeting after meeting night after night and say this is not actually him this is not his ideas this is my idea that's why I back it up over vindicate it should I just change this thing let's just get rid of this yeah either way I think I'm pinned my pin and Pen me look at me like Mike okay spoil for choice all right so if we look at this here now how many people see see it's when God comes down and confirms his word that's how we know it's the truth or not that ain't all debate that should end all all questions right when God comes and amens his word so now if we just take this one part of this promise here because if it's one thing for Jesus to to speak it there's another thing for for them to actually realize actually what he's saying has happened can you I don't know if I'm in a shower in a box or somewhere amen all right just turn this down a bit okay so now let's just take one and the recovering of the sight to the blind now how many blind people did Jesus heal during the time of his ministry amen but you see see how many blinds see he healed many blind to show that the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled now we just take one for example take blind Bartimaeus remember remember he was brother Brown would dramatizes his life and say he was a devout man he believed in Jehovah God you know he lived there in Jericho and you know his mother would put him on his knee and begin I mean put him on her knee and would tell her tell him the great stories of you know Elijah and Joshua and Rahab and all those stories that happened there in Jericho and then she would tell him you know that same God is still alive today somewhere he still lives but then his eyes begin to you know when he's a young boy he went blind and then they gave him in those days apparently they had instead of like a dog to be the you're seeing dog they they had lambs and then and then Blind by the mass you know he got married he had children and and then in order to get money he had these two turtle doves that would dance over each other like a street performer and people would give him money but then what would happen of course is I mean you know one of his children got sick and he went out beside the side of the house because the doctor said nothing can happen and then he promised he said he said Joe great Jehovah God I know you're a God of Miracles I know you're still a Healer I promise I'll give I will give one of these turtle doves as a sacrifice and let the other one go amen as a yeah you know that my daughter will get well and and then so so he did that you know when he was taking the turtle doves to the temple that day no doubt there was someone there and you almost said Bartimaeus you know you don't have to give those doves those ones give you income you know you just take one of my doves he said no no I didn't but then he said to that man he said thank you very much but I didn't promise God any Dove I promise this one amen and then and then his daughter got well and then his wife got real sick after that and then he went out the side of the house where he used to pray he said Jehovah God you healed my daughter I promise I'll give you the slam I mean that that my wife will get well I need her to raise the children to be my wife all these things and so he took that lamb actually the lamb led him to the temple because that was his eyes and then so as the lamb was leading him to the temple maybe the same same man said to him you know butter Mass where are you going he says I'm you know my wife's not well but I but but I believe you know I'm going to give a lamb and she's going to get well and then to the same man said but but that's your eyes you need those eyes to look around amen yo you need that lamb take this lamb but he said no no I promised God this lamb and God will provide me a way to look around you know what you give God God multiplies in a far greater measure amen you know the devil steals the youth steals our age steals our time but God doesn't steal nothing he actually restores far greater than what you give him amen because because if we give our youth to God God will give us Eternal youth Hallelujah if the devil steals your youth he doesn't give you nothing back you know you know in return so then butter Mass gave the lamb and then his wife got well now he's a beggar there yeah and Jericho and he had warm himself brother Brown would say that the that the walls of the city the bricks would get worn by the Sun and you know push himself up against the brickwork to warm himself and then he heard a commotion go past him that he never heard before whether you know you heard the shouting some some people were crying Hosanna some were saying he's Beelzebub some were saying have nothing to do with them some you know all these kind of things going on and then he began to say what's going on because he can't see amen so he begins to ask and someone comes to him and says this is Jesus going by who's Jesus well he healed this person he raised Lazarus from the grave he calmed the storm he fed thousands and thousands of people amen he you know he opened the eyes of the blind Open the Eyes of the Blind and I told that man that God will give me back my sight he'll give me eyes to see and he began to cry out Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me amen and it wasn't it wasn't the volume of his cries that stopped Jesus it was his faith touch the master other than Jesus Stood Still and when and he opened his eyes amen why because when Isaiah was anointed to write the prophecy and it said in the recovering of the sight to the blind there had to be a predestinated person or people that would have the faith that that would be manifested in their lives amen who was that blind Bartimaeus Hallelujah there was another man who was blind from birth and and as Jesus passed by him he saw a man which was born blind from his birth and his disciples asked and saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind so in other words whose fault is it that he that that he's in this state you know it's amazing how man always is always looking for another person to blame for the reason they or another person in the state they're in but Jesus answered neither has this man's sin nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him amen so there can be a trouble passed down through a family right so it's not even the parents fault or the or the child's fault but the reason that's there is that the works of God would be manifested I mean things can happen to us in life we're not looking for it we don't deserve it you know but but God allows it why that the works of God should be very manifest in you Hallelujah so this this man was not born blind by chance he was actually part of the prophecy that we read about from Isaiah hey man I'm trying I'm trying to build a point here because I'm coming something I mean now that's why they were that way right he wasn't born blind because of his evil or his parents he will know that the works of God would be made manifest amen see God ordained that they would be in that state that when the Fulfillment of that prophecy came it would be fulfilled in them see prophecy is not some vague thing it's actually for a people right there's a people that will fulfill the word of God Amen and they may not realize blind Bartimaeus and this man born blind I doubt very much they had Isaiah's prophecy on their mind when they realized they were blind right I don't believe they walked around saying he's going to restore the eyes of the blind here I am it's going to be fulfilled in my life no they were just going about their daily life amen but when God had that prophecy written Hallelujah he had them in mind so God ordained that they would be in their lives the Fulfillment of that prophecy would be in them now we are here as well that the prophecy in the word would be ordained would be fulfilled in our lives are you following me amen with when the word speaks of a Rapture when the what speaks for a bribe without spot or wrinkle or any such thing amen when God ordained Paul to write those words he was thinking of you amen when Malachi would write that it's in Elijah before the great and beautiful day of the Lord and He who's he God shall turn the hearts of who amen you back to back to God hallelujah see where Malachi wrote that he had God had you in mind amen when when the Apostle Paul wrote first Thessalonians 4 down he had God had you in mind amen but but you see now God would allow us to come out of many different backgrounds out of many different troubles out of many different livelihoods or whatever more we've all come out of something we all I trust have a testimony of God's Saving Grace amen where God's grace became amazing to us even if we came out of the world and we're raised out of a church peer we could literally Trace our lineage from believer to believer to believer to believer back to Adam they still got a time when you meet you know you've met God and his blood has come upon your life and you've been changed Amen to now so now so God is showing in those prophecies it doesn't matter what we came out of if we're part of that word God's going to transform us until we're ready to go to fulfill that amen hallelujah aren't you glad that God does that for us praise the Lord there's not us trying to it's not us trying to match the word it's God actually causes us to match the word hallelujah amen so it's not us trying to be Christians in our own strength it's actually the spirit of God comes in and then he's a Christian in our lives praise the Lord I'm so thankful for that Hallelujah so now so now you've got to look at all trouble and say no the reason this trouble is sure maybe I cause this trouble maybe I cause the sin to come into my family but ultimately I believe that that that that it's that the works of God should be made manifest shall we repent shall we say Lord forgive me it's my Fallen nature as loud as I come in in this trouble but Lord I believe this has come into my life that your Works would be made manifest in me amen whether it be healing or Deliverance whatever it is amen that's the works of God praise the Lord Hallelujah so now the disciples looked at a lot of things they had to real you know many times they were just living in the moment but it was the word being fulfilled as we read there in Luke another time was when was when in Matthew 21 where Jesus was going to come into Jerusalem and actually tells two of his disciples go and you'll find a cult there and you know unloose them and then you know when when when the man who owns it comes out says what are you doing says the master has has need of him you know and bring him here Jesus did not say it now boys this is what I'm going to fulfill but hold on here comes your king coming to you riding on a you know you know riding upon a donkey meeking lowly no he just said go do this and it began to be fulfilled in front of them hallelujah what was going on now prophecy was becoming history Hallelujah but then now we come down to to Acts chapter 2. and then when the day of Pentecost had fully come amen when when when when everyone outside thought that that the disciples the other 120 they were drunk with new wine Pete would stand up and say no we're not drunken as you suppose just being the third out of the day but this is that spoken by the prophet Joel amen so so now it was actually the Holy Ghost in Peter telling the people what you're seeing in front of you is the Fulfillment of Prophecy that is no longer a prophecy that's looking to history but now it's actually being fulfilled right now Holier where God himself would come and dwell in a people Hallelujah she said it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughter shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and all my servants and all my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy Hallelujah so so he he he could identify this is what Joel spoke of so it was a vision it was a prophecy now it's in fulfillment but notice this is and it shall come to pass in the last days so he speak out more than just one day but two days Days right now we know that one day with God Is A Thousand Years upon the Earth right so in these last two thousand years now God's Gonna pour His Spirit out upon All Flesh amen and even through the church ages the Holy Ghost has been poured out I mean but in this but in these last days now the Holy Ghost is actually poured out without measure it's not restricted it's not just a partial word being restored but the full Promises of God have been restored amen we're not just under a justification or a sanctification or even the gifts I mean but we have all that and The Giver it's the giver himself came down that's whatever the day of Pentecost The Giver himself came and dwelt on his people that when Peter walked out the you know the disciples walked out it was no longer them living but Christ Living in them amen what happened now now now the Believers are the mechanics right but brother M says we must have the Dynamics and the mechanics rise is not just the mechanics of being a Believer but there's got to be a dynamic power that causes the word to be manifested in our lives and I want to say this the Redeemer has come to Zion the the Dynamics are here I mean we're not just quoting a prophet and quoting the message that's all very good quoting the scripture but we see the one who gave the promise fulfilling the promise I mean so the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost the Dynamics of the word are actually living right in front of you and I Halle we're not looking for it to come it's here amen just like the Ducks there waiting for water no it's raining but what has lifted us up above the above the fusses between churches all those things that stuff's gone away we're being lifted up above it aiming because the Dynamics now if God has restored his word and God has poured himself out now without measure amen and so what has that done that's actually now the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost is in the church to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever to prove that every Divine promise of God is true amen because there's always a dispute is the word right or is it wrong I mean you take that Easter time there's going to be you know there's a dispute Jesus knew he'd race it was a revelation to him he went to Calvary with one scripture revealed to him that that he was not going to stay dead and that was when David would prophesy saying I'll not leave my thy soul and Hell neither suffer suffer my Holy One to see corruption that was a revelation to the Lord Jesus right so he went to Calvary knowing that his body would not Decay but he'd be resurrected again amen but now then then on that Easter morning there was still a dispute will he raise will he not raise amen me but then God came down to prove that his word was true what happened the the mechanics of the body of the Lord Jesus was dead in the Tomb but then the Dynamics himself came down raised them back to life again roll the St you know Stone out of the way and he walked out triumphant proving that what was prophesied was now in fulfillment and so the dispute was over now we come to our lives we think many times are we Christians are we going to make it amen yo sure we may line up with the word and all sincerity we repent we are baptized name of Jesus Christ you know we live according to the word our sincerity but then but then now when the Dynamics comes down I mean the Holy Ghost comes down and lives in US amen all all worries should be gone all strive should be over I mean all questions am I going to make it am I going to be in heaven that that's actually been answered holy because why the Dynamics comes down the Holy Ghost comes down into you and God tells you because I love you you shall live also amen you're alive right now in Jesus Christ hallelujah amen to the Dynamics are here friends amen hallelujah and all it will do is get greater and greater why what happens because expectation begins to grow amen before the before Azusa Street there was an expectation for for Revival Los Angeles was actually a lot of people were were crying out for God to do something as a whole burden of prayer upon the whole city pretty much but then in a little a little house amen is when the gifts were restored so it went from expectation of God can do it to now an expectation God does it and he'll do more that's the same thing with you and I you know when you first hear testimonies but you've never experienced the power of God what happens Faith begins to rise and you get expectation God can do it look we've got record that he's done anything spy infallible proofs we know that his word is true but then when you experience the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost amen it increases your expectation because it's not he will do it but he has done it and he'll do more amen that's how we should be this morning he has done it he will do it and he'll do more Eamonn he'll pour His Spirit out more he will deliver more he'll fill with the Holy Ghost more he'll pour out his peace more amen he will guide us with a far greater hand amen he will move in power more amen our services will lose human control more hallelujah hallelujah this is this is the expectation we should have amen because why because God is in control of his church right I mean if we've really surrendered Our Lives to the Lord we are no longer our own it's no longer as I said last Sunday we don't have a plan B in life his word is it and that's the plan just like Jesus when hears and Gethsemane amen he didn't say not my will but thy will be done and I'll just go with you and see how this goes no he fully stranded his will no matter what he had to suffer he went through anyway and that should be the same thing with you and I it doesn't matter how bad things get how Troublesome things get it seems you know it doesn't matter how much it seems like prayer is not being answered we're not leaving I mean all the bridges have been burnt I'm not going back I have nowhere to return to amen I burned every bridge amen when the Lord called me I said Lord I'm walking with you I don't know where you'll Lead Me day to day but I know you'll Lead Me day to day holy it doesn't matter how much trouble how much Strife how much worry comes in don't look at those things just trust your Shepherd he will guide you through Hallelujah Amen to the Dynamics are here Amen brother Brown says the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost right the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost and this is the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that has worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and the body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will race her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will raise up in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies the Dynamics is the holy spirit so it says it's been working in small measure but it's going to get greater it's going to get greater amen it's not going to diminish it's going to get greater so God is going to move in a more powerful I just want to raise your expectation I mean what we've seen is nothing compared to what's ahead of us I believe it amen God is all-powerful he can do all things amen he can you know there's nothing that he cannot do amen he can restore amen he can restore your bodies missing limbs amen he can put a desire in someone's heart who's had no desire for God Amen he can do anything he wants to but he needs you to speak it amen he needs us to be surrendered remember the third Paul all it's not us naming and claiming brother Brown when he was hunting didn't say I feel like speaking squirrels into existence today no God initiated it and he responded and God manifested it right and it's the same thing with you and I we just walk with the Lord he initiates it when we have a need we respond and he manifests it right holy it's not us saying well let there be whatever whatever that's what the world has made it right no no it's not that just walk with God and love him and he will do it Hallelujah you've ever had a time in prayer where you realize it's not you praying and God and it's actually God praying through you what is that that's actually the third pull I put it that way it's God take it it's God taking over your lips and you're speaking Hallelujah with him we then we ought to stay in the condition where God can do that anytime he wants I mean we want to be available for whatever he wants to do if he just wants to use us once in our lives praise God I'll keep walking with him like he'll do it again amen if he wants to do it every day praise God but we just got to be available see and this is why the devil always brings in fussing and fighting and trouble because he wants us to leave our first love he tries to distract us with something else and sure there's a lot of distractions here right that can cause a lot of trouble but if we but love looks beyond the humanity amen that we can actually keep walking in our first love see the power of his salvation will always be tested but it won't fail amen hallelujah amen his blood will be tested but it will never fail so the devil does not believe that it is enough to stop I mean I mean he believes it's not enough to stop him stop the devil but the power of the Cross is more than enough to stop any demon of Hell Amen brother Adam said when he had the vision of the Finnish Boy you know you know and there's two two years before it happened he he told everyone write this down the Flyleaf of your Bible and then he found himself in Finland and he came before the accident and he didn't even realize where he was but then he began to look around and actually turned away from the accident just feeling sorry for the child and the parents but he felt a hand on his shoulder and he turned around then he began to look at the scene again this is I've actually seen this before amen I remember the mountains I remember the boy was dressed like that he said to Brother Moore you know open the Flyleaf of your Bible is this not what was prophesied and he began to realize it was no longer prophecy but it was actually happening right in front of him amen then then he had confidence he said now every demon in Hell could line up and it wouldn't stop the boy raising from the dead why because what God had spoken was now in front of him he was living in the vision amen if we're if we realize we're living in the vision of the word amen that what God has said see many times we say the world the tears have come to maturity hold on look how mature Sodom and Gomorrah is it's no longer a baby it's no longer a little leaf coming out of the ground it's now it's you know it's seeds are spreading everywhere it's in a mature form now if the tears are that way what about the wheat I mean because they'll both grow together I mean even now actually the tears have been bound for the burning I mean do you remember I can't I think it was bro um I can't remember his name exactly but but but there's a brother that that that gave a testimony and you know he was in Pentecost he's a Pentecostal pastor and he was part of the part of the arranging of one of the first International passers conventions in America now he had a friend that that came to the message and but that man wasn't converted when he first tried to share it with him and his friend was a big man and literally picked him up and pinned him against the wall and said you want to grow up spiritually but then years later he met the same friend and his nature was totally changed why because God had done a work in his life it wasn't just his Zeal and yes praise God God's in a prophet and the word is true but that word came into his life and changed him and then now this man started reading I think it's I think his name was brother Robert Milligan or something I might have that completely wrong but I'll find the testimony and put it on the WhatsApp but then now he was reading the church age book and all this while he's he he he's planning this this convention and he came to the first meeting uh light and he comes in and everyone's on their feet shouting and rejoicing and the pastor that's preaching saying basically we don't need to look for the coming of the Lord the Lord's not coming back we're going to eat the corner of the land and here we are and everyone's all happy and and and it's a brother Robert or Richard I think it was you know he's thinking what is this and everyone's shouting rejoicing thousands of people in an auditorium and then it's like the sound is completely turned off and a voice speaks to him and says this is what you read in the book by my prophet of The Binding of the tears where this false Doctrine that's being being preached is buying the tears for the burning and then a boy said you better get out otherwise you'll be bound also he ran out of that place he never returned it's already happening so the tears have matured and are being bound for the burning what about now the grain [Music] amen because if that's mature this is mature amen if the tears are mature then the bride is mature amen holy see we're no longer a stalk under Wesley or whatever more but no the grain is back again brother Graham said what was planted is now here Hallelujah I'm looking at grain here people I'm no longer a mixture of seed of tears and whatnot I'm looking at grain I talk about a seed in your soul amen not your Humanity but a seed in your soul holy so now if the grain is here praise God why don't the grain to be doing all right Amy because many people they'll take a quote saying well brother Bram says we're just going to relay in the presence of the Sun and ripen the grain is green who's read that right and then people paint that as a picture of now we're just sunbathing you know and and we're not doing anything we're just because there's not a lot of movement down the grain it's just a piece of grain on the on the table and it's ripening and things now that sounds very nice I like the Sun but that's not true because what did the first grain do all right see if rain has come back again what did the first grain do now Jesus when he was born he didn't lay ripen in the presence of the sun right here's the first grain now what did he do he cast out devils he healed the sick he raised the dead amen he he spoke to the storms and he showed he had dominion over all demons he had dominion over nature he had dominion over everything Hallelujah see see this is what the first grain did amen the first grain turned the other cheek the first grain loved his enemies amen the first grain forgave without even an apology coming first amen he loved that those that betrayed him he called Judas friend he wasn't being sarcastic right so this is what the first grain did amen he didn't hold The Grudge he didn't have any Feud against anyone he didn't have any odd he didn't have anything like that there's no malice drive for Envy in this grain this is what the first crane did hey we love to talk about Jesus walking on water but what about turning the other cheek what about what about saying father forgive them they don't know what they do I mean what about calling those that betray you friend hello what about that that's what the first grain did Amen in it now if the grain is back amen the second the grain should do the same because it's the same grain amen see we're part we're made of the same material you know you were made of the word amen so can you love your enemy can you love those that despitefully use you or do you hold a grudge do you stew on what they've said and what they've done and all those things and they should have done this and why didn't do the are you chewing on those things or can you forgive them can you love those that have an ought against you can you love those who don't want to be reconciled with you that's what the first grain did halia we are the same material amen can we can we look at our brother and sister that we know that they actually are out to get us you know we should never have this attitude that we want to see people fail we should never want to you know actually have a have something in our heart when people leave church saying well I I knew that would happen well if you really had that kind of discernment you would have gone to them before they ever left and said are you okay how are you doing how's things even if they don't respond to you at least try Hallelujah see see we should never have this while yeah I knew that would happen oh my God what a prophet you are you know but see people get it get that in their mind I knew that family would fall apart I knew that this would happen we should never be that way it was the first grain like that amen he loved everybody he loved Caiaphas the same as he did John he because the love of God doesn't change right but it's how it's received that meant you know that matters amen you know the Rich Young Ruler Jesus said and he loved him but the love wasn't received otherwise he would have sold over his Goods to the poor and followed the Lord amen but that's what the first grain did we should be see the first grain suffered wrong and took it can we suffer wrong and take it or do we have to reply in kind or or do it or or retaliate some other way or can we just suffer wrong amen see he threw it the first grain surrendered his own will to his fathers so he went to Calvary as a man can we actually surrender our own will that's actually the will of God is greater than her own will can we surrender our own will that if someone else in the family who wants something that we could last fight out wants to to allow them to have theirs as long as it's right right or is it always me me I I now now remember this is the me generation me too hashtag me too no it should be God right don't take that out of context you know all those things are wrong what's happened to people but yeah but but you understand it it is a metoo generation I want it me me me but can we lay aside those things for the greater good of our family and different things that's what the first grain did he saw your need he didn't have to go to Calvary but out of his own choice he did he wasn't a robot he chose to can we be that same kind of a person amen he says now we see last night uh no sorry we said last night we have so much mechanics and not the Dynamics so I'm going to wrap this up now my body is the mechanics but my body will not operate without the Dynamics of spirit see and the spirit operates my body brings it in control amen that's how we should be where where the spirit of God the Dynamics has our body and control to the word of God Hallelujah you know I just I just finished with this if you don't mind Jesus would say in Romans uh yeah Jesus would say in Romans 8 but we are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell in you if any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen so so if that same spirit is in you he will Quicken your mortal body amen if the Dynamics Has Come Into You of his holy spirit amen then what then he'll also Quicken this Mortal body hallelujah what order what what kind of people should we be this morning every promise I don't have time I'm going to finish just there but I just want you to go look into it every Divine promise of God is here amen the spirit of God brother Ramses quickens us to every promise every promise we're quick unto by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen the Dynamics is

trust you've died to yourself you've crossed over into the baptism of the Holy Ghost where every promise of God is for you right now whether it be healing the salvation of your family Deliverance amen a Breaking of cycles of family Spirits or moods or Temperance whatever it is everything that's not of God Amen God's power is here to Deliver Us from it amen if you've got to be quick and amen to have more of God Amen he's here to Quicken it to you healing Deliverance the body change the Rapture whatever it may be the promise is here right now the Dynamics is here can we have the musician's place
