[19:45] to encourage one another I'm one of them
[19:48] I press on what about you yeah come on
[19:51] you know we have to sometimes drag
[19:53] people along but we need to encourage
[19:56] one another amen and you know you can
[19:59] share testimonies to the glory of God
[20:03] they are uplifting you can also tell
[20:06] stories which drag people down did you
[20:08] hear about this one and that have you
[20:11] know all the failures but let's talk
[20:13] about the positive things that's right
[20:16] let's never uh leave uh lose sight of
[20:21] where we're going I like to read you a
[20:22] scripture in Hebrews 12 I've got a few
[20:25] scriptures here but Hebrews 12
[20:28] uh verses 1 and two it says here
[20:32] wherefore seeing we have also we are
[20:36] also compassed about with so great a
[20:39] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[20:43] every weight and the sin which does so
[20:47] easily beset us and let us run with
[20:50] patience the race that is set before
[20:53] usall looking unto Jesus the author and
[20:57] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[21:01] that was set before him endured the
[21:04] cross despising the shame and sit down
[21:07] at the right hand of the Throne of
[21:11] God the race that race that is set
[21:15] before us we all have a race to run we
[21:18] all in that race and we all have started
[21:23] the race because Jesus is the author and
[21:28] finisher of our faith he takes us all
[21:31] the way through and we need to keep our
[21:34] eyes on him to finish that race and we
[21:38] want to run the race to win you know we
[21:41] want all want to be
[21:43] winners you know we want to arrive
[21:45] together at the Finish Line you know
[21:48] he's the author and finisher of our
[21:50] faith we will go with him all the way
[21:55] and that's what I tried to highlight
[21:57] tonight we go with Jesus Christ all the
[22:00] way all the way amen not just part of
[22:02] the way all the way we making part of
[22:06] all of our Lives not just part of our
[22:08] Lives amen and you know find so many
[22:10] times people making part I never forget
[22:13] this situation years ago
[22:16] somebody took me along he said oh we go
[22:19] and see this Christian lady I have to go
[22:20] and drop something off and and then we
[22:23] went there and I saw this woman and I
[22:28] nearly fell
[22:29] over didn't look Christian at all I mean
[22:31] I wasn't trying to judge anybody but you
[22:34] know it was
[22:37] a solo mother dressed very sexy painted
[22:41] up flirting with the neighbors and
[22:43] trying to get favors everywhere and he
[22:45] said this Christian lady and then he saw
[22:48] the shock in my eyes and he looks at me
[22:51] he said she accepted him the Lord as
[22:55] Savior but not as Lord well how can you
[22:59] accept the Lord as Savior and not as
[23:02] Lord you know he's all how can I marry a
[23:06] wife just for her cooking or just for
[23:09] her this or the other you know it's all
[23:12] or nothing and I was so puzzled how can
[23:17] you even even uh tell people you can
[23:19] receive them as your savior and as you
[23:22] Lord he is Lord and the Lord will take
[23:25] us to the to the end we go all the way
[23:29] with the Lord Jesus Christ he says I
[23:32] will never leave you nor forsake you so
[23:35] we all have different Journeys and I've
[23:38] I've well I've walked with the
[23:41] Lord over 43 years now and uh I've
[23:45] experienced many many things I just
[23:47] witnessed to somebody yesterday and said
[23:50] look 43 years ago I had a supernatural
[23:53] experience when Christ came into my life
[23:56] everything changed
[23:58] and ever since I've been battling
[24:01] religious Spirits you know that try to
[24:05] disagree with the word of God or or
[24:07] whatever you know it is a journey and we
[24:11] have to battle on and press on to the
[24:13] end all the way we go with the
[24:16] Lord when things go tough some people
[24:18] drop
[24:20] out have you ever heard somebody say are
[24:22] you still a Christian yeah what a stupid
[24:25] question I say come on if you're a CHR
[24:27] Chris you're always a Christian you stay
[24:29] a Christian how can you be anything
[24:32] different see all the
[24:35] way Jesus went all the
[24:39] way he went all the
[24:42] way through life through Temptations
[24:45] through Battles
[24:47] Through um rejection through everything
[24:51] through to Calvary all the way to
[24:55] Calvary he didn't stop in a garden of
[24:57] geiman that's right Lord if there's any
[25:01] other way there was no other way amen
[25:03] and he went all the way to the
[25:06] Cross just imagine him stopping just
[25:09] before calling a Le Legion of a angels
[25:13] and
[25:14] and be it done no he went all the way
[25:19] all the way to Calvary you see John 174
[25:23] says where Jesus said I have glorified
[25:26] thee on the Earth
[25:28] I have finished the work which thou
[25:31] gavest me to
[25:32] do we all have a work to do amen we want
[25:36] to be at the
[25:37] end we don't want to say w wow I have
[25:41] undone business no I have all we go all
[25:44] the way with the Lord you know it's
[25:46] actually an exciting
[25:48] life many times in life you get troubled
[25:53] I mean uh we're in this flesh we live in
[25:56] this world we have a an enemy and um we
[26:00] are troubled but we never give up we
[26:02] push on all the way amen many years ago
[26:06] when I was um I was married about two
[26:10] three years and um I went to potic for
[26:14] another year fulltime so the income was
[26:17] very very
[26:20] restricted and I was a bit misled by the
[26:23] people about student allowance and all
[26:25] these things I got
[26:28] $135 a week and the rent was $140 in
[26:33] those days so I had no
[26:35] money I didn't know how to do it or what
[26:38] to do I was so desperate and so worked
[26:42] up and not just I'm just try to say that
[26:47] when you go through a trial you don't
[26:49] always get sympathy from other people
[26:52] they you did a stupid thing or you
[26:55] should have thought about it before or
[26:57] you you know I was there and had
[27:00] criticism from all sorts of places and I
[27:04] was you you would say on my own now the
[27:08] Lord was with me I remember never forget
[27:11] that I was standing in the
[27:13] lounge so desperate so upset and I said
[27:18] to my wife I don't know how it's going
[27:21] to happen I don't know what but I only
[27:24] know he never lets me down
[27:28] we go all the way with Christ and you
[27:30] know he blessed us in a tremendous way
[27:33] way we could never have imagined you
[27:36] know I gave up my part-time job at the
[27:38] library because I got so much money
[27:41] given to us and that
[27:44] year I went to politic I had so much
[27:47] money I had enough to buy a house after
[27:51] wow so that's how the Lord can change
[27:54] things but you see the challenge came if
[27:57] if you give up because of a problem you
[28:01] never experience the blessing of God if
[28:04] you if you stop halfway you never get
[28:07] there we've had a girl come to church
[28:11] once she used to go to church was
[28:13] brought up in church and then um she
[28:17] wanted to get married so she came back
[28:18] to church give it a go
[28:22] again three months four months no
[28:26] husband ah given up and left church
[28:30] again you see that's not the believer
[28:33] that is not the believer but these
[28:35] things do happen we get these challenges
[28:37] and things we all go through but there's
[28:40] two groups I would
[28:42] say we all you can say when you compare
[28:46] with Israel they all came out of Egypt
[28:50] all came out of Egypt but not all
[28:53] entered into the promised land there was
[28:56] Caleb and Joshua from their
[29:00] generation you see they did not go all
[29:03] the way with the promise of God and I
[29:06] think I mean these things are written
[29:08] for us for an example that we learned
[29:10] from it never give up halfway if things
[29:14] go go difficult just Rejoice we should
[29:18] never lose sight of our destination
[29:22] Hallelujah always look we're waiting for
[29:25] the coming of the Lord don't know about
[29:27] you but I wait for the coming of the
[29:28] Lord I wait for the dead in Christ to
[29:31] rise and to see them and be caught up
[29:34] together and meet the Lord in the air
[29:36] Amen brother I want to get there I don't
[29:39] want to be sidetracked by trouble and
[29:42] things of this world and you see there
[29:46] are the two categories really we have
[29:49] followers but then we have real
[29:52] Believers and I believe we the real
[29:54] Believers the two categories are found
[29:56] throughout the Bible you know that right
[29:59] to the end
[30:01] time he had Israel is like the church
[30:06] the followers Caleb and Joshua is like
[30:08] the
[30:10] Believers knowledge sight feelings and
[30:15] circumstances versus faith in the
[30:17] promise of God now when we have the
[30:20] promise of God it's yeah and amen to
[30:23] doubt
[30:24] it makes God a liar you know we don't
[30:28] want to doubt what he says we just want
[30:30] to hang on have you ever been in a
[30:32] situation where say you were sick or
[30:35] something and and in agony and pain and
[30:38] and you pray and you're still in pain
[30:40] and said Lord what's wrong what's wrong
[30:43] with my faith I've had that you know six
[30:47] years ago when what had a back injury I
[30:50] was in such Agony with back pains no
[30:54] painkiller no nothing helped nothing
[30:56] helped
[30:58] I was going up the wall Lord what's
[31:00] wrong with my faith I put prayer cloths
[31:03] on me and I even had a rock from Brother
[31:05] bram's grave would you believe I laid
[31:08] everything on me possible you know
[31:10] trying to get Faith and said Lord what's
[31:13] wrong with my faith you know and uh I
[31:16] want to be healed it's a natural thing I
[31:20] was in such
[31:22] Agony and I know the Lord is my healer
[31:25] so I did not lose sight of that despite
[31:28] the
[31:29] pain you know uh I couldn't go get to a
[31:32] doctor but I went to a
[31:34] Physio and obviously they didn't know
[31:37] what was wrong with my back oh they
[31:39] squeezed it and squashed it and did it
[31:41] all sorts of things and guess what after
[31:46] the treatment I was paralyzed in my
[31:48] leg I was a
[31:51] they were in shock and organized
[31:54] a specialist for me straight away
[31:58] I was limping around and dragging my leg
[32:00] behind being being
[32:03] paralyzed
[32:05] and and then I hadit this doctor's
[32:09] appointment and I prayed I said Lord if
[32:12] you want me to go through the doctor
[32:16] speak through the doctor you know I
[32:19] didn't see instant healing but I said
[32:22] use the doctor speak to me through the
[32:24] doctor I'm just talking about old away I
[32:28] went to the
[32:31] doctor and he sent me for an MRI
[32:34] scan had another meeting with the doctor
[32:38] and he said Mr
[32:40] rug I've never seen the back as bad as
[32:43] yours well that's not the voice of God
[32:46] that's not what I expected you know
[32:49] speak through the doctor but I didn't
[32:51] hear Christ speaking through the doctor
[32:53] honestly I didn't I was hanging in there
[32:56] and and then uh asked about being
[33:00] paralyzed he said look uh you have a
[33:02] small small chance to come right but no
[33:06] guarantee uh with an operation usually
[33:08] after 3 months it's permanent if you've
[33:10] been paralyzed anyway that didn't sound
[33:14] like God speaking through the doctor
[33:16] either right but I was hanging in there
[33:19] eventually had had at the day of the
[33:22] operation I went there you know had to
[33:25] fast and do the things and then put on a
[33:28] nighty you know and then they wield me
[33:30] in to the operating theater here comes
[33:34] the anist pulls down the mask and tells
[33:38] me what he's going to do and I might
[33:40] have a sore throat after and all that
[33:42] and then comes the doctor pets me on the
[33:47] shoulder and says how you feeling you
[33:50] know before they put you out you know
[33:53] and I said oh a lot
[33:55] better and he he said oh touch my knee
[33:59] said do you have feelings there and I
[34:03] thought yeah maybe you know I said yeah
[34:05] he said can you walk to get off the bed
[34:08] walking up and down there like this I
[34:11] walked you know and
[34:15] then a very unusual atmosphere in that
[34:19] room doctor didn't talk the other guy
[34:24] waited he turned his head and here
[34:29] comes what I was waiting for speak
[34:31] through the
[34:33] doctor at the operating theater last
[34:36] moment doctor
[34:38] said if I were you I would cancel this
[34:44] operation Wow have you ever heard of
[34:46] such a thing after going through all
[34:48] these things in you there in the
[34:49] operating theater wow I said I
[34:52] cancel and I knew that it was God's
[34:56] speaking to me but guess what I had to
[34:59] hang on there to the end all the way all
[35:03] the way it didn't just happen when I
[35:07] first
[35:08] prayed I I've seen or experienced times
[35:12] when it instantly happened but you know
[35:14] I had to wait and have faith all the
[35:19] way I went out and the nurses said oh
[35:23] what are you doing what have you been
[35:24] doing I said praying and
[35:27] then rang my wife she burst into tears
[35:30] you know and I went home happy
[35:35] as being healed I wasn't you know I was
[35:39] still paralyzed three days later I woke
[35:42] up completely healed a week after that I
[35:45] played a tennis
[35:47] tournament amen praise the Lord all the
[35:49] way all the way Hallelujah and we want
[35:52] to go all the way with Christ you know
[35:55] no give up when we when we go through
[35:58] something when things not going well we
[36:01] hang in there we go all the way and we
[36:03] will see the glory of God yes sir so i'
[36:06] like to encourage you no matter what
[36:09] circumstances you're in or whatever go
[36:11] all the way press on Praise on you see
[36:15] don't go by knowledge or sight or
[36:17] feelings or
[36:19] circumstances go by faith in the promise
[36:21] of God Amen you know the
[36:25] followers of
[36:28] Moses they all came out of Egypt they
[36:31] all came out of Egypt they struggled
[36:33] with various situations and things on
[36:36] the way but they failed to enter the
[36:39] promised land because they did not go
[36:42] all the way with the word the word that
[36:46] came the promise was out of Egypt and
[36:50] into the promised land you see that was
[36:53] the word they did not go all the way you
[36:56] know sometimes you read scriptures and
[36:59] you you nail it down but you fail to
[37:02] read the one next to
[37:04] it I had this experience just a while
[37:08] ago I was doing Outreach in church there
[37:11] outside the church I had a table out and
[37:14] next
[37:15] thing a woman
[37:17] came and she's she talked about things I
[37:22] said yeah the churching is in the back
[37:24] oh can I have a look opened the door and
[37:27] she saw the church saw the pulpit in her
[37:29] back she said wow didn't know there was
[37:33] a church here she said if I would come
[37:36] to a church and see a woman in the
[37:39] Pulpit I turn straight right around and
[37:42] walk out that's what she
[37:44] said but you know she had completely
[37:47] shaved ha she didn't read the next
[37:50] scripture you know it's just a r woman
[37:52] shouldn't be uh having authority to
[37:55] preach yeah but but she didn't read
[37:57] woman should have long hair you know
[38:00] they don't go all the way it's all of
[38:02] the word we don't want to get a a a a
[38:05] pet little scripture and ignore the rest
[38:09] we want to go all the way take all
[38:11] counsel of God anyway
[38:15] Israel versus Joshua and Caleb one looks
[38:20] to the so-call fs the other looks to the
[38:23] promise you know one so one look at the
[38:28] So-Cal facts they're Giants in the land
[38:31] they're bigger than we are and and all
[38:33] these things they fail to see the facts
[38:37] yes it's a land which flows with milk
[38:40] and honey and all these things they look
[38:42] at the problem rather than the
[38:45] promise and but Caleb and Joshua they
[38:49] said we can take it the Lord promised it
[38:52] amen and you see that's the brink people
[38:55] come to quite often come to the brink
[38:58] and instead of entering in pressing in
[39:00] into receiving the Holy Ghost that's
[39:03] really what it is into the rest they
[39:06] just stopped there yeah we believe we
[39:09] came out we done all these things we
[39:12] seen the glory of God we seen the r sea
[39:14] opening we seen Miracles we felt his
[39:17] presence but they failed to enter yeah
[39:19] because they don't go all the way you
[39:22] know the promise is right into the
[39:25] baptism of Holy Ghost the promise is
[39:29] right to the coming of the Lord we're
[39:31] not giving up halfway amen so let's
[39:35] press on until we have and are filled
[39:38] with that peace that passes all
[39:40] understanding that's what the Bible says
[39:42] you know when people are nervous or
[39:46] worried or lose the
[39:48] peace that's not what we should have you
[39:51] see the Devil comes to Rob and steal
[39:55] destroy to kill
[39:57] but Jesus came to give us life and life
[40:00] more
[40:01] abundantly so what do we accept his
[40:04] promise or the negative side we always
[40:08] need to make this choice now I go all
[40:10] the way with the word of the Lord all
[40:13] the
[40:14] way so if the peace of God that pass our
[40:18] understanding is not here I said Lord
[40:20] what's wrong I want that peace you know
[40:23] and I don't want to carry on with that
[40:26] their peace they pass all
[40:30] understanding and I also want to have
[40:32] perfect
[40:33] love you know the the quote nothing will
[40:37] enter except perfect love so that's what
[40:41] we want 1 John 4:18 says there is no
[40:45] fear in love but perfect love casts out
[40:49] fear because fear has torment he that
[40:52] fearth is not made perfect in love so
[40:56] what what do we want we want old the way
[40:58] to get that love that perfect love so
[41:02] fear goes away we we don't want to
[41:05] entertain fear it's not humility to be
[41:08] fearful it's it's actually
[41:12] unbelief there's another
[41:16] scripture Colossians 3:15 and let the
[41:20] peace of God rule in your hearts yeah to
[41:24] which you're also called in one body and
[41:27] be thankful let it rule in your heart
[41:30] amen go all the way with
[41:33] him now in the
[41:36] scripture you you see many example many
[41:39] examples I just want to give you one or
[41:40] two from people who have um been
[41:44] challenged on the way and had to decide
[41:47] to go all the way you look at jono in
[41:50] the
[41:54] Bible he when when he was we know the
[41:57] story when he was thrown over board and
[41:59] all these things and swallowed by a big
[42:02] fish or a
[42:04] wh
[42:06] he
[42:09] said johnah 2:7 and 8 said when my soul
[42:13] fainted within me I remembered the Lord
[42:17] and my prayer came in unto thee in thine
[42:22] Holy
[42:23] Temple they that observe
[42:27] vanities forsake their own Mercy that's
[42:30] quite something isn't it and I give you
[42:32] a quote in that Jonah said there are
[42:36] lying vanities he said once more will I
[42:40] look to your Holy Temple told God
[42:43] because when Solomon dedicated that
[42:45] Temple he said If thy people be in
[42:49] trouble anywhere and look to this holy
[42:52] place and pray then you'll hear from him
[42:56] heaven and he believed Jonah believed
[43:00] that God heard Solomon's Prayer yeah and
[43:02] he started saying I'll not look at this
[43:06] whales belly I'll not think about my
[43:10] backsliding condition I'm looking toward
[43:13] your Holy Temple and make confession
[43:17] isn't that wonderful you know we can't
[43:20] find ourselves in a miserable State
[43:23] sometimes or have failed some people and
[43:27] if you look at that you get worse and
[43:30] worse and you feel condemned and you
[43:32] feel worse and worse but we're not
[43:34] looking to that we look to Christ look
[43:36] to Christ I just mentioned to Brother
[43:39] Andy
[43:40] before you know looking to Christ is
[43:44] like Bible says come with boldness
[43:48] before the throne of grace with boldness
[43:51] and how do you come with
[43:53] boldness if you've been a good boy for
[43:55] the whole week
[43:56] been in church three
[43:58] times witnessed to the neighbor done a
[44:01] good deed to an old lady given some
[44:04] money to a poor bigger and you come
[44:07] before the throne of grace like the
[44:09] Pharisee Lord I pay my TI and I I do all
[44:14] these things and I'm not like them no
[44:16] that's not the
[44:18] way you can't come like that yeah if you
[44:21] had the miserable
[44:23] week you lost the plot somewhere
[44:28] you done something wrong and then you
[44:30] feel condemned you had wrong thoughts
[44:33] and you feel
[44:35] condemned I can't really come before the
[44:37] Lord I'm I'm not good
[44:39] enough you come with boldness he spite
[44:43] because you come on the basis of the
[44:45] blood of Jesus Christ nothing else
[44:49] Hallelujah nothing else you come upon
[44:51] the basis of the blood of Jesus Christ
[44:55] it doesn't matter how how good you are
[44:56] how bad you are that's not the basis you
[44:58] come to godj through Christ and remember
[45:03] that next time when the devil tried to
[45:06] stop you from going all the way hey I
[45:09] come with boldness because the blood of
[45:12] Jesus Christ cleansed me from all sin
[45:15] all sin he carried all of my sins past
[45:19] present future I'm a Son of God I'm a
[45:22] daughter of God you know you go that way
[45:26] claim the blood claim what God
[45:30] accepted the Holy Temple the prayer of
[45:34] Solomon God accepted that and he had to
[45:37] just be reminded of that I turn toward
[45:41] that Holy Temple looking to God of
[45:43] course and he was
[45:47] delivered you know it's there's another
[45:50] one you know Paul the Apostle Paul he
[45:54] got Shipwrecked we know that
[45:57] I I I read that story from acts 22 acts
[46:01] 27 from Verse 18 to 20 and we being
[46:06] exceedingly tossed with a tempest the
[46:10] next day they lightened the ship and the
[46:13] third day we cast out with our own hands
[46:17] the tackling of the ship and when
[46:20] neither Sun nor
[46:23] stars in many days appeared must have
[46:26] been
[46:27] horrible and no small temples lie on us
[46:31] all hope that we should be saved was
[46:34] then taken away all hope was taken away
[46:39] you know most of these people on the
[46:42] ship would have thought that's it we're
[46:45] dying no
[46:48] hope but not so with Paul why did Paul
[46:51] have hope or not
[46:54] fear have you ever thought about that
[46:56] one why did he not fear oh he was a
[46:59] Believer no he had the word the promise
[47:03] of God
[47:07] Amen acts
[47:09] 2311
[47:12] says and the night following the Lord
[47:15] stood by him and
[47:18] said be of good cheer Paul for as thou
[47:23] has testified of me in Jerusalem M so
[47:27] must thou bear witness also at Rome that
[47:31] was before he went on the boat he had
[47:33] the word God
[47:36] said I'll have you as a witness in Rome
[47:39] so no devil in hell could stop him amen
[47:42] nothing could stop it but he had to hang
[47:45] on to what God actually told him go all
[47:48] the way oh temp doesn't matter storm
[47:52] shipwreck doesn't matter all the way
[47:55] I'll go going to be a witness in Rome
[47:57] that's thus sayith the Lord that's what
[48:00] it what it was you see that gave him
[48:02] confidence even in the greatest
[48:05] storm to be
[48:08] rejoicing and to have not just hope but
[48:11] have faith I'll be there I will be there
[48:15] no matter what and no storm is too
[48:19] big for for us in that sense he said I
[48:23] will never leave you no forsake you amen
[48:25] he he takes us all the way there amen
[48:29] see the situation was H
[48:32] hopeless and it looked like certain
[48:34] death and everybody lost hope except
[48:37] Paul because he had that word that
[48:40] promise that he will be a witness in
[48:42] Rome there's one more I like to
[48:45] share the story of David and Goliath I
[48:48] don't go through the whole lot we know
[48:50] the story but I want to make a point
[48:53] first Samuel was 17 verse 32 says and
[48:58] David said to
[49:00] Saul let no man's heart fail because of
[49:04] him thy servant will go and fight with
[49:07] this
[49:09] Philistine so
[49:11] David believed the promises of God he
[49:15] believed in the victory he believed in
[49:17] the power of God Amen and if you do that
[49:21] you sometimes are on your own he the
[49:25] whole crowd was in
[49:27] fear and Saul himself said to David thou
[49:32] are not able to go against the philistin
[49:34] you know no can't be
[49:36] done to fight with him for thou are but
[49:40] a youth and he a man of war from his
[49:44] youth oh God what a discouragement you
[49:47] know when you want to go all the way you
[49:49] come across all this discouragement and
[49:52] unbelief and
[49:54] nonsense
[49:57] you know I came to New Zealand in
[49:59] 1975 I decided in 1974 I want to travel
[50:03] the
[50:04] world
[50:06] and I was telling my mates and friends
[50:09] I'm going over the other side of the
[50:12] world going to go to New
[50:15] Zealand oh you can't do that everybody
[50:19] said you can't do that you can't speak
[50:21] English you haven't got a job over there
[50:25] you can't leave your apartment here and
[50:27] you can't leave that good job you've got
[50:29] you can't do that everybody said you
[50:34] can't and I thought no I can't I go all
[50:37] the way I came all the way here and I
[50:40] tell what wasn't easy all the time but
[50:43] all the way all the way discouragements
[50:47] come people try to drag it out even
[50:49] well-meaning people friends and
[50:52] sometimes here the the king of Israel so
[50:57] you know
[50:58] H now you can't do it and David said
[51:02] unto
[51:04] Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep
[51:08] he gives a testimony I've experienced
[51:10] God before and there came a lion and the
[51:13] bear and took a lamb out of the flock
[51:16] and I went out after him and smot him
[51:19] and delivered it out of his mouth and
[51:22] when he arose against me I caught him by
[51:25] by his beard and smote him and slew him
[51:28] can imagine fighting with a lion on the
[51:31] beard thy servants slew both The
[51:36] Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised
[51:40] Philistine shall be as one of them amen
[51:43] seeing he has
[51:45] defied the armies of the Living
[51:49] God we are the Church of the Living God
[51:53] so um amen that David said moreover the
[51:57] Lord that delivered me out of the poor
[52:00] of the lion and out of the poor of the
[52:03] beer he will deliver me out of the hand
[52:07] of this
[52:08] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[52:12] the Lord be with
[52:15] thee and Saul armed David with his armor
[52:19] he put on a helmet of brass and his on
[52:22] his head and also armed him with a coat
[52:25] of M and David GED his sword upon his
[52:28] armor and aside to go for he had not
[52:31] proofed it and David said un soul I
[52:34] cannot go with these for I have not
[52:37] proved them you know there's quite a
[52:40] quite a lesson in
[52:42] that you know those things the normal
[52:46] army use
[52:49] that but if we are walking by faith not
[52:52] the Living God we don't need to
[52:55] understand everything that's
[52:57] happening if the Lord's with us who can
[52:59] be against us you see that is what it
[53:02] comes to and David put it off him and he
[53:07] took his staff in his hand and chose him
[53:09] five smooth stones out of the brook and
[53:11] put them in the shepherd's bag which he
[53:14] had even in his even in his grip and his
[53:17] sling was in his hand and Drew near to
[53:20] the
[53:22] Philistine and the Philistine came on
[53:25] and Drew near uh unto David and the man
[53:29] that bear The Shield went before him and
[53:32] when the Philistine looked about and saw
[53:36] David he disdained him for he was but a
[53:39] youth and Rudy and of fear
[53:42] countenance and the Philistines said
[53:45] unto David am I a dog that thou comest
[53:49] to me with stars and the Philistine
[53:52] cursed David by his gods
[53:57] by his Gods the gods of the
[54:01] Philistine isn't that
[54:04] incredible by his Gods it same was
[54:07] Jezebel and her Gods you know came
[54:10] against
[54:11] Elijah by his Gods I just read in a
[54:14] paper this
[54:15] morning in in Turkey I think it was one
[54:19] of the members of parliament was
[54:21] swearing about
[54:23] Israel and so
[54:26] my God Allah will judge
[54:29] them and the very moment he said it he
[54:33] dropped the heart attack that's in the
[54:36] newspaper by the
[54:38] way he's God he's God it's not the god
[54:44] the Almighty we serve and the
[54:46] Philistines said to David come to me and
[54:49] I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of
[54:51] the air and to the beasts of the field
[54:55] then said David to the Philistine thou
[54:58] comest to me with a sword and with a
[55:01] spear and with a shield but I come to
[55:05] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[55:08] praise God the god of the armies of
[55:11] Israel whom thou Hast defied you see
[55:14] Israel looked at the facts so cold but
[55:18] David looked to the Lord and the
[55:21] promises and the power of God see and he
[55:24] wanted to go all the way it didn't want
[55:26] to stop because of a giant have you ever
[55:29] faced Giants in your life they come in
[55:33] various forms and ways trouble but we
[55:36] don't stop there we go all the way we
[55:39] fight those
[55:42] things he can say who are we tonight
[55:46] followers or Believers Israel or
[55:53] David as I said we all Fai
[55:55] Giants problems in life we all have
[55:58] different ones we all face these
[56:02] things do we run do we compromise or do
[56:07] we
[56:08] believe now I tell you something
[56:12] interesting David chose him five smooth
[56:16] Stones okay can I I brought you five
[56:20] smooth Stones just to make a
[56:23] point I like you to to just see how
[56:27] smooth they are just see how wonderfully
[56:31] smooth the stones
[56:36] are not a sharp edge on
[56:39] them not the chip on them smooth you
[56:44] know how they got
[56:46] smooth tumbled in the water years and
[56:50] years being thrown around having the
[56:53] sharp ages taken off
[56:55] and sometimes we feel a bit like that
[56:57] don't we amen but when we are smooth the
[57:01] rough ages have been taken off we are
[57:04] fit to slay Giants amen that's the point
[57:07] we are fit to slay Giants amen and when
[57:10] we go through the tumbler don't think
[57:13] it's something bad it's something good
[57:15] because you're going to slay a giant you
[57:17] see that's that's the point I'm trying
[57:20] to make but you don't get smooth just by
[57:23] quoting scriptures you don't get smooth
[57:25] by that you get smoothed by overcoming
[57:28] the problems you're facing overcoming
[57:31] the situations you're in that builds
[57:34] character in you and you get
[57:37] smooth and then you're fit for the
[57:40] sling to kill the Giants
[57:43] amen amen
[57:46] amen you see in order to get smooth you
[57:49] have to get through the tumbler of
[57:51] life's challenges and overcome them go
[57:55] all the way don't give up when when
[57:57] things go
[57:59] hard you
[58:01] know sometimes people go through uh
[58:05] difficult times when they're
[58:07] married two different people have to
[58:10] become one can be quite quite hard you
[58:13] know for
[58:15] some and uh it's it's like
[58:19] um how can I put
[58:22] it two become one
[58:25] you don't have to be the same you don't
[58:28] have to have the same Hobbies you don't
[58:30] have to say you know my wife doesn't
[58:32] like motorbikes she doesn't like boats
[58:36] she doesn't like the things I may like
[58:39] and I don't like sewing and I don't like
[58:41] homework and I don't like doing dishes
[58:44] you know I'm just saying we are very
[58:47] very
[58:49] different but we are not one because we
[58:53] have the same Hobbies some I see people
[58:55] you know was traveling through New
[58:57] Zealand husband and wife push biking you
[59:00] know that's the last thing I would ever
[59:02] want to push by along the road you know
[59:05] both had that Hobby and they both have
[59:07] have
[59:08] little Cal muscles like this and you
[59:11] know it's h they unite on the Hobbies
[59:17] but our Unity is
[59:19] love and you may see things slightly
[59:22] different to to what I see and you know
[59:25] why we see things differently
[59:28] sometimes
[59:30] upbringing whatever Church you go to
[59:34] influence
[59:36] maturity you you learn things I I do
[59:40] things differently than I would have
[59:41] done 20 years
[59:43] ago I once pulled somebody out of a bed
[59:46] and said I don't want an evil spirit in
[59:47] my house you know I mean I wouldn't do
[59:49] that nowadays you know I've calmed down
[59:53] but maturity changes things you see
[59:56] maturity changes things doesn't mean if
[59:59] you're young and I'm older that uh and
[1:00:02] see things differently or do things
[1:00:05] differently doesn't mean we can't be
[1:00:07] United amen we don't need to go the same
[1:00:11] church we need to have the same Holy
[1:00:13] Spirit that's it it's same with the love
[1:00:17] in a marriage if you have love you don't
[1:00:19] need to see everything alike you love
[1:00:22] each
[1:00:23] other and that's that's the unity we
[1:00:26] want you
[1:00:28] see so I don't know why I'm saying these
[1:00:30] things but uh
[1:00:33] anyway Shar sharp ages will be knocked
[1:00:39] off and you in the hand of God will be
[1:00:42] fit to slay any
[1:00:44] joint any
[1:00:46] joint we don't come in our own strength
[1:00:49] that's right we don't come in our own
[1:00:51] power we come in the power of the Lord
[1:00:54] the ho Holy
[1:00:58] Spirit your words and your prayers will
[1:01:02] be effective did you know
[1:01:07] that let's send a slingshot of prayer
[1:01:12] against whatever problem we are
[1:01:14] facing be a believer know the power of
[1:01:17] God and trust him against all the odds
[1:01:21] now I like to finish with a
[1:01:23] quote
[1:01:25] because it's it's so important that
[1:01:27] we go all all the way with these things
[1:01:30] not take part of it look I want I just
[1:01:33] want to tell you another incident I know
[1:01:37] a friend I knew he was in the Army he
[1:01:40] was a Christian and they used to mock
[1:01:43] him and they had to sit in one day and
[1:01:46] the chaplain the army chaplain was
[1:01:50] preaching
[1:01:51] bu and they knew him and then he read
[1:01:56] Romans 3 oh I think I find
[1:02:01] it Romans I I read it out
[1:02:04] otherwise I might say it's
[1:02:08] wrong you know the
[1:02:13] um the believer he believed that his
[1:02:16] sins were forgiven that the he was
[1:02:19] sinless because he was a
[1:02:21] Believer and the the the
[1:02:25] Chaplan said Romans 3 uh 23 says for all
[1:02:31] have sinned and come short of the glory
[1:02:34] of
[1:02:35] God now what do you say to this he said
[1:02:38] to that man singled him out who believed
[1:02:41] that he was you
[1:02:43] know and then he didn't know what to say
[1:02:46] for a moment but then he remembered his
[1:02:49] mother said to him somebody challenges
[1:02:51] you with a scripture just ask what is
[1:02:54] the next one
[1:02:55] saying so he said what's the next
[1:02:57] scripture
[1:02:59] saying verse 24 being justified freely
[1:03:04] by his grace through the Redemption that
[1:03:07] is in Christ Jesus praise God you see
[1:03:11] that's where we need to go all the way
[1:03:14] not just take part of the word amen you
[1:03:16] know all the way with the word and I I
[1:03:21] read you this uh quote which uh
[1:03:24] may have heard it before he says if took
[1:03:28] these precious sheep of God he's talking
[1:03:31] to the devil these ladies they caused
[1:03:36] them to B their hair and wear makeup and
[1:03:40] look like things that the Bible condemns
[1:03:44] and you thought you had them but I come
[1:03:48] with a simple little slingshot of prayer
[1:03:52] and bringing them back tonight you can't
[1:03:55] hold them any
[1:03:57] longer you've lost the battle he's
[1:04:00] talking to the devil straight these
[1:04:04] precious men standing here Lambs of God
[1:04:08] turn them
[1:04:10] loose we adure thee in the name of the
[1:04:12] Lord Jesus Christ I place place them uh
[1:04:17] Place between this habits and tempers
[1:04:20] and immorals and whatsoever it may be
[1:04:23] our place the blood of Jesus Christ by
[1:04:27] faith between
[1:04:29] them and that
[1:04:31] thing again you not catch them anymore
[1:04:36] they're in the father's pasture they are
[1:04:40] his children keep from them in the name
[1:04:43] of Jesus Christ I adure Thee there is
[1:04:47] not a devil in hell can touch you if you
[1:04:51] believe that you are covered by the
[1:04:53] blood blood isn't that wonderful am it's
[1:04:56] isn't that what it is people
[1:05:01] get captured sometimes or hindered from
[1:05:04] going all the way with the Lord you you
[1:05:07] hear this testimony of Might things
[1:05:10] happening and and how people experience
[1:05:14] the power of God and and you you oh
[1:05:16] wonderful testimony and you can send it
[1:05:18] around to people to read but you go all
[1:05:22] the way with God and you experience the
[1:05:23] same thing thing yeah you have that in
[1:05:26] your own life you go and trust him all
[1:05:29] the way I just want to finish just with
[1:05:32] one more
[1:05:34] scripture to give you another um what do
[1:05:37] you call it um hint of what we facing
[1:05:41] nowadays you see we want to go all the
[1:05:43] way with our faith until the coming of
[1:05:46] the Lord but we live in a time which is
[1:05:50] very very difficult around us
[1:05:55] here the Bible says in Timothy uh 2
[1:06:01] Timothy 3 this know also that in the
[1:06:05] last days perilous times shall come
[1:06:09] perilous difficult times troubl times
[1:06:13] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:06:17] selves there's all around us selfish
[1:06:20] people lovers of themselves we don't
[1:06:23] want to get caught up in that
[1:06:28] covertness
[1:06:31] boasts
[1:06:35] proud you know when to read these things
[1:06:37] out those are spirits that give that
[1:06:42] manifestation and if we have these
[1:06:44] things in our lives
[1:06:47] anywhere we need to get rid of it comes
[1:06:50] from the wrong Source we want to go all
[1:06:52] the way with Christ yes boasts proud
[1:06:58] Blasphemous disobedient to
[1:07:01] parents what that's taught at
[1:07:03] school
[1:07:06] unthankful
[1:07:09] Unholy without natural
[1:07:13] affections it's all around truth
[1:07:17] Breakers say something not doing it
[1:07:20] false
[1:07:22] accusers Inc
[1:07:24] continent
[1:07:26] Fierce despises of those that are
[1:07:30] good
[1:07:33] traitors heady highminded
[1:07:37] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[1:07:40] God having a form of godliness talking
[1:07:44] about it but denying the power there of
[1:07:48] from such turn away you see if you hang
[1:07:50] around with that kind of people it drags
[1:07:53] you down to that level it drags you down
[1:07:56] to that level I tell you I finish with a
[1:07:59] story I do finish with a story you know
[1:08:03] one of my
[1:08:05] sons um gone a bit
[1:08:08] worldly and uh he picked up a
[1:08:12] girl at a party you know and friendly
[1:08:15] and all these
[1:08:17] things uh top it off he got a
[1:08:22] pregnant and and
[1:08:25] um one
[1:08:28] day I ring him up I was driving the car
[1:08:31] I ring him up on the speaker
[1:08:34] phone and I said to
[1:08:37] him you
[1:08:39] know when you are unequally
[1:08:43] yolked either she drags you down to her
[1:08:45] level or you bring her up to your
[1:08:49] level and I said I haven't seen you in
[1:08:51] church anymore since you out with this
[1:08:55] woman guess who's
[1:08:58] winning little did I know he was on
[1:09:00] speaker phone too and she was sitting
[1:09:02] next to
[1:09:03] him but I tell you another thing blessed
[1:09:07] is he who is not offended in me she
[1:09:09] wasn't
[1:09:11] offended and they got married they have
[1:09:14] two children now and about 6 months
[1:09:18] ago she had an experience in the Lord
[1:09:21] her testimony is the the Lord revealed
[1:09:25] himself to me she didn't even believe in
[1:09:27] God the Holy Spirit came and she was
[1:09:31] baptized and you know how that
[1:09:34] works all the way all the way with
[1:09:37] Christ and you know we don't need
[1:09:40] to to try to uh beautify the word it is
[1:09:45] pure the way it is if it hurts it hurts
[1:09:49] so bad
[1:09:51] yeah blessed is he who is not offended
[1:09:54] in me and she wasn't offended she's a
[1:09:56] lovely woman you know and we never
[1:09:59] pushed her didn't say oh should
[1:10:01] shouldn't wear those pants and you
[1:10:03] shouldn't wear this you know she she was
[1:10:05] wearing shorts and this and a dozen
[1:10:09] earrings and you know and the while ago
[1:10:11] she asked my wife she said do you think
[1:10:14] it's wrong to wear
[1:10:15] earrings and she said look the Lord will
[1:10:18] show you you
[1:10:19] know so she obviously prayed and the
[1:10:22] morning she went wakes up all
[1:10:26] infected she took them all out you know
[1:10:30] the Lord leads you on she goes all the
[1:10:34] way with the Lord we don't have to push
[1:10:36] them we have to encourage themen to go
[1:10:39] all the way but it is he is the way and
[1:10:42] he leads the way if we say you should do
[1:10:45] this now and you should do that now we
[1:10:47] may mess up the program it's God it's a
[1:10:51] a relationship between you and God God
