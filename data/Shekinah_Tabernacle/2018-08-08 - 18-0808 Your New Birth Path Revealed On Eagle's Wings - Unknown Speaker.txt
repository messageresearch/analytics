========================================

you [Music] good evening everyone who's happy today are you living on a mountain how's the song go I'm living on a mountain underneath a cloudless sky I'm drinking from a fountain that never shall run dry yes I'm feasting on manna from a bountiful supply for I'm dwelling in Beulah land you know who's flying in an airplane up above they say 35,000 feet it's never any rain or anything a you know the yes it's always sunny it is never it's always an awesome view you always get to see a long way over all the clouds and you can be flying over some treacherous nasty weather below you but you just you wouldn't not and you know when you dwell and the presence of God that's what it's like you know there may be chaos all around you and yet you're in a different place yeah you're above it all and the secret place so that's that's that's really the the victory that a Christian has is that he we can walk in that place you know and and and I guess that's our challenge as we go through life we learn more how do I get there and how do I stay there you know how do i how do I operate there and it's as we grow in the Lord we we like to think that we dwell there more than we dwell on getting all stressed and worked up and you know with our natural natural man so let's um let's stand this evening and we'll open up and pray Heavenly Father word I'm just grateful that we can be gathered here this evening to just to come and give you praise and give you all the glory Lord and and to always remember Lord the the privilege and honor that it is that you've called us Lord and that was that it was your goodness that led us to repentance that Lord there was a time where we weren't interested in the things of God and they even though it was the most valuable thing we could ever need or ever want or ever have and yet we had no desire for it Lord but it was your mercy Lord that showed us that we need you that we need a Savior Lord and the being something at us to respond we responded and we're just thankful for that law and we just come to just to praise you and glorify you Lord and to humble ourselves before you this evening maybe bless brother Andy as he ministers what we we accept him as a minister from you Lord and we we accept law that he's going to bring your word this evening and we just respect and honor him that way Lord and we know that that's the way you would desire us

way you want to show it Lord the way that you have in mind that your anointing fill this place Lord father anoint speaker in here tonight we humble ourselves under your mighty hand to be used of you and Lord just take control of the service take control of every spirit in this room and in every living room and every home that's listening to this take control of every spirit we bind every country spirit of unbelief in the name of Jesus Christ but your word would go forth and you would reveal the path of a new birth that you would reveal the place that we've never gone before and how you're showing it Lord and how we could humble ourselves and listen and hear the voice behind the voice the voice of a king the shout of the king that is in the camp or father may we see it may we hear tonight Lord we are listening in the name of Jesus Christ I commit these things to you amen thank you so much musicians praise the Lord Amen god bless you it's a privilege and an honor to be here why we're standing can we turn in our Bibles - Amen hallelujah - Sam 119 verse 105 [Music] a men I was very nervous man so nervous my body was doing things that it doesn't know we do but you know you just yield to the Herman you know he makes all things good Alleluia amen he strengthens the weak and feeble and I will put my hand up there amen and I'm not coming in my strength I can tell you that for free hallelujah amen because my strengths will bring nothing but his strength brings life amen hallelujah so hundred and nineteen verse 104 hallelujah before I read that I tell you the the the text as your new birth path revealed on eagle's wings amen your new birth path revealed on eagle's wings amen and I'll explain that in the sermon amen so let's just read here through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way thy word is a lamp unto my feet hallelujah and a light unto my path amen is that your confession this night MA hallelujah Lord add your blessings to the reading of your word in Jesus name Amen you may be seated Alleluia and I'm just going to move fast through these readings because I just want to read a few things in quotes and scriptures to get the context and then we'll we'll see how the Lord leads in me so let's just go to some 1611 it says thou wilt show me thou will show me now we have to have our complete attention on the detailing of the scripture here thou Jesus Christ will show me the path of life there's a path of life and there's a path of death now there's only one path of life and that is the voice of God that will reveal the path of life amen so amen thou will show me the path of life in thy presence amen so he's this is connected now thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is the fullness of joy and at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore amen so there is a reason why David you know under that inspiration he he says you will show me the path of life because without him without that's showing there is no life and and and but yet you for that to happen you need to be in his presence you need to get in his presence you need to live in as presence amen sometimes you will have hard times and you'll fail and you'll fall on the ground but get up and get back in his presence amen hallelujah make it right if you wrong someone go make it right don't wait it out and God is not a person that you need to wait till he cools down and then you make it right you can just make it right the moment that you failed Amen and get in his presence stay in his presence abide in his presence he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall rest amen not strive not get all worried and agitated and tossed to and fro but rest under the shadow of the Almighty Amen hallelujah so you see thou will show me the path of life so there is a path of life hallelujah and it is not an hour mind to know it hallelujah it is not an hour ability to figure it out there is no way that a human being can read the Bible in their own ability and find the path of life hallelujah because it's not a cookie cutter path there is a path for every individual amen every single one of us has a path of life and that path that path is going to lead you to your adoption that path is going to lead you to a rapture hallelujah that path is going to lead you to the fullness of the word and then the fullness of the word is going to take over your life and completely transform you prepare you and make you retro ready Alleluia not you but there is a path it's not our ability I won't show me the path of life a theologian won't show me the path of life the book of something else won't show me the path of life amen my intellectual ability to try and the the word won't show me the path of life me knowing every translation of the scripture ain't going to show me the path of life that's just my intellectual ability but I need to rely on the provision of the Lord I need to know what is God doing in my day because whatever he's doing is going to be for me it's going to affect me it's gonna be something for me it's going to be someone for me it's gonna be a ministry for me it's gonna be a pastor for me it's going to be something that God is doing and I need to find that out hallelujah amen it's sometimes it takes you know we get caught up in situations and everything like that and you get mowed down by all the crust on the eagle's head somehow you need to go to the rock amen and start scraping your head hallelujah so all of those thoughts and all of the stuff that overwhelming can just break off but only the rock can do it only the rock has the power amen to crack break off that crust hallelujah amen so we can heifer because there is an individual path amen hallelujah I'm so glad for that hallelujah okay you can rest amen you can rest even at the beginning of your walk with the Lord hallelujah the moment you start to catch a whiff you start to hear a voice Amen you start to hear something you start to catch something you know that something's going on that God is being raised out of history a man and there's something real happening a man and you start to catch that take rest amen let him lead you humble yourself humble yourself amen oh my amen praise the Lord Matthew 2 verse 10 and 11 says here these wise men were led to the fullness of the word by the light of the star amen a prophet said that these stars were following a birth path hallelujah so there's a path of a birth to lead people to the Messiah amen when they saw the star this as the wise men now when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented him gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh hallelujah you know these men would never have known where to go if it hadn't have been for a star that was guiding them and leading them and you see there was a purpose for that star in the sky and that star had a natural path of birth paths and these three stars come together amen and they and they come together and it was a and it was a sign in the heavens that something on the earth special was going on amen hallelujah amen and you know what we have had a star in the heavens and this generation Amen because the coming of the Lord imminently approaching amen hallelujah so the coming of the Lord immediately approaching what happens is you know up in the heavens there's a star that shines amen as the Sun comes around the earth there's a star that starts to reflect that light now that star doesn't give off its own light this is the morning star messenger that God sent to forerun the second coming amen a morning star messenger that God sent to forerun the second coming now he didn't give his own light off but he was a reflection you know let's just go natural here this star this morning star you know jesus promised the overcome of the morning star so it's not Satan if anyone even thinks that because he's just a phony morning star but the real morning star is Christ amen now so here we have Venus sitting in the sky and as the Sun comes around it reflects and just because the light you see the light is not quite enough in the earth at the time so you can see that morning star Venus reflecting the light of the Sun that's coming around the earth it's coming but you see as the as the coming of the Sun comes around that drowns out their light because the Sun is here and so we had a Morningstar messenger there is and I want to just speak about this not I'm gonna go through the whole sermon about the star but I just want to show you something that God declares these things in the heavens and the earth and nature and the Bible from Genesis to Revelation it's everywhere it's not just something that's been concocted up in some laboratory or some you know funny thing that's just done in darkness but he declared this over the whole earth in the universe and history in the future and everything this is the clear Amen now so you have the star that is pointing the way it is pointing to something it is pointing to someone and is declaring that there is light coming it is declaring the coming of the son amen and so here's a star and the people the wise people of this day can look up and see amen and they will continue to look up and see the stuff and they will see week because there's darkness all around right it's all dark and it's dawn you know dawn it's like not quite completely pitched but it's just a mental mediocre and yet you can still see that star in the sky there is a believer that hasn't entered the veil yet there is a believer that still you know they're on their journey they may have come out of Egypt they may be in the wilderness but they've got to go a little bit further and they look up and they can see the star in the sky and he say the Sun is coming there's going to be a day dawn where is that they going to be dawn I tell you it's going to dawn in your heart Alleluia and when that day dawn man this is the whole purpose of that morning messenger to come to declare a coming Sun so the Sun can come and you amen and when that happens you don't see no morning messenger no more you see him hallelujah you see the pillar of fire you see the king amen you see a second atom in your life hallelujah taking over because the light of the glory of the coming Sun lights everything so you don't see human males anymore you don't see this me and putting this man in front of the Smith you know see all of these things you see a king hallelujah let me read a scripture to Peter 1:19 2:20 says here we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well a man who's thankful for a sure it word of prophecy that's evening hallelujah who's thankful for a message who's thankful that God wouldn't leave us in a denominational stupor fella Louie who's thankful that we can forsake our own thinking our own opinions their own traditions and everything and lay them all down her lujah who's thankful that they know what they should die to go before the king amen this is why he sends these things this is why he sent us this is love amen a sure word of prophecy where until you do well a man that you take heed hallelujah don't stir to the left or to the right the devils will try everything they can to get you they'll try everything they can young people hallelujah they'll try everything they can to pull you down oh my but you come and hit the sweet spot of that relationship you'll see these pleasures at his right hand forevermore amen there's nothing in this world compared hallelujah as unto a light that shine within a dark place Amen I can tell you there's a very dark place in humanity that's the human heart before the Son of God comes in amen it's a very bad place it's a place that people will go tossed to and fro they relying on religion they're relying on pastors to top them up every week they're relying on people just pray for this thing and all that that's all good don't get me wrong but you can't just rely on that you have to have your own testimony you've got to have your own experience with the King amen that's what this message is for to bring you into Union amen to bring you into a union with the second enemy men hallelujah the king the one that wants to come down into your life hallelujah and give you something to eat something that you will never die amen something you can eat and never die hallelujah that's cooked the tree of life he wants to give you that amen hallelujah I'm getting right ahead now okay Wow hallelujah amen mmm man I need to do some running hallelujah hallelujah amen as unto a light that shine us in a dark place until a man here it is the day dawn Amen see when the day dawns in your life you know you've watched this messenger and he's preached you out of Egypt he's showing you the true Passover he's shown you what it means to apply the blood on the lentils of your hearts amen he's his message has brought a Goshen in your life hallelujah to keep you from the gross darkness from Egypt amen get in the presence of God if anyone is in that place right now they're still in Egypt they haven't been baptized if anyone's their progress amen step forward amen but get in his presence once in a while it may give him his presence tonight anyone on the air out in the homes get in his presence amen hallelujah you can have his presence wherever you're at Amen hallelujah because he's gonna guide you he's gonna guide you out of there Alleluia but if you don't get in his presence the crust that's the form and you forget the good things that he's done for you you forget the things that has happened to you you start to forget everything in a Niva comes down and you forget who you are you lose your identity so get in his presence it's your privilege claimants they hold of your inheritance tonight lay hold of it grab hold of it hallelujah push the Dibble back amen you fight him amen you fight him with your mouth hallelujah hallelujah amen push him back because you see your heritance it's to give him his presence even if you're there hallelujah but you see he's not finished it was to take you through so he sends this this they star they light in the sky that starts to tell you this is true baptism this is what it means to repent this is the name that you take in marriage hallelujah this is the identity that you're losing and the one that you're gaining amen hallelujah this is the true baptism and when you take that true back and you go over that see Amen hallelujah when you go over that see you see there that the false baptism does not have this power but when you have a true baptism and you go over the sea your enemies get drowned Amen those things that try to keep you in the world those enemies that try to pull you back into Egypt they get drowned amen hallelujah all of them Alleluia amen but he's not finished you see he's still gonna look at that is like get in his presence amen when you're in the wilderness and you're walking in the place you know I like in the wilderness now you've come from the outer Court you've gone through the altar and your later life to a degree you know you know completely across Jordan yet but you've you've recognized Calvary you recognize the Passover lamb you know and prieser you've been washed and these things going on your experience is increasingly you're in the you come across them seeing you come into the into the wilderness now your tests and the trials start in your life and you know as they start you know you're I liken this to the holy place this is the place where it's religious now and you know you're relying on the priests to bake the bread for you and and you eat that bread but the bread can go stale and sometimes you know to you it might not feel very good and you know you get this crust on your head if you don't get in the presence of God and the smoke you know sometimes the priests my the oil might go smoky you know and we've heard the preaching on this you know you're relying on priesthood now you're relying on other people for your experience but you know God is calling you further if you just look up Amen if you just get into his presence amen hallelujah and abide in him abide in him hallelujah oh my oh no all that crust all those thoughts you know you see you know it gets so busy when you're in the wilderness so hard sometimes because it's the whole purpose it's to purge you it's to cleanse you out amen to make you realize you can't do it amen it's to it's to expose the devil in your flesh and in that old nature that's trying to rule hallelujah you see but there's a purpose and if you get in the presence of God he will lead you to the kadish pioneer he will lead you up to the border he will lead you through the holy place past the showbread amen past the seven golden candlesticks in the light of the seven ages which is good and it's nice and there's good things in there amen but he wants to take you further he wants you to die amen he wants you to die on the altar of incense amen he wants an incense of your death they meant the death to your old nature hallelujah but if you don't if you fail to get in his presence while you're in this place and you live a natural Christian life and you just do things from day to day and you don't get into his presence and your prayer life is a ruin and your Bibles readings are ruined and you just sit in church and fall asleep 'ln and you know it's just not very entertaining for you you know this is not a good place to be because that's when the crust that's the form on your head hey man you don't want the crust on your head no no no crust because you see the crust forming on the head you know you can turn into some of these people that are fighting against Moses because they're not seeing the voice behind the voice they start getting caught up in the human politics get caught up and the things of man get caught up in the failures of man they want to watch Moses and see how he found here and did this here has a temper and maybe sort of fighting with his wife a few times and they thought wow this is not good you see because they and they saw everything so the miracle saw the glory of God they saw the great things amen but somehow their minds got blinded oh they might got blinded as my friend and it's not good hallelujah so it's so important but the people that got in the presence of God like Joshua and Caleb they kept a vision they kept faith and when they heard Moses speak they could hear the voice behind the voice they could hear the king speaking amen they could hear a spiritual voice these two things paralleling there is a message of william branham and his information and his teaching and his humanity and the effort that he made to bring for the message and then there is another paralleling power a power of prophecy fulfilling Scripture and that's the pillar of fire that's inside him that's the king of kings the judge of all the earth hallelujah coming down and leading a man to take a people further but people that don't get in his presence people that just live a natural Christian life they don't see these things and the devil starts to attack them and bring them down and they miss that they miss the voice behind the voice um but if you get in his presence hallelujah he will reveal your path to your new birth he will reveal your birth path your supernatural birth path because your natural birth past the stars that align naturally they made you they were your enemy the old nature is your enemy amen those personality traits and all that stuff but you see God has a specific path for you and it's going to undo all those things that wilderness experience is going to undo them all for you so that you can die on the altar Easter you see Esther seeking the King here's a picture of what's happening in our day here you have Esther now you have a king and he pulls and he wants a bride in the end time and the King pulls for a people for her first bride and she doesn't come so he does away with the denomination he does away with Pentecost he wants a bride it's nice this call for all the Virgin's of the land and the Virgin's come amen and all these people gather under a revival amen foolish and wise virgins and you see there was only one amen and I'm glad I'm part of that one amen you know what they will all be they all had the same Bible to read they had the same kings visions they had the same anointment sand same everything to use and they all started closing themselves and according to their own prophecy according to their own imagination they started to form a golden calf in the wilderness amen they started to form a golden calf of their own imagination they said this is the God that died on Calvary for me this is the God that took me over the Red Sea but it was their imagination and there's no way I'm telling you this there is no way to - to do it in your own strength God provided the Spirit of Moses the spirit of Joshua the same anointing the same ministries he provided because of a third Exodus that's happening in this thing there's a third Exodus where God is taking a bride out of a church and he's going to take her into the second Edom's Garden of Eden and you're going to live with him in a millennium Amy he's going to take you there hallelujah but you have to come under the prophetic power of the Prophet you cannot pass it yourself and you can see it perfectly clear in Esther because here is this Chamberlain amen and he knew the mysteries of the King he knew the heart of the king he knew what the King enjoyed he knew what he loved he knew how he wanted her to walk he knew how he wanted her to wear the clothing the anointing the oils amen the approach hallelujah the speak the speech he knew and he started to reveal it to her and you know what she knew now her birth path to Queen amen you catch them her birth path to Queen hello Queen hello get in his presence now while it before it's too late a man you young people get in his presence Amen hallelujah you just lay aside everything and so you can get in his presence and you can see beyond their photo seeing of William Branham and you see a pillar of fire they mean you see the King leading the Prophet hallelujah because the prophets Carney's in heaven but who's here who's here you need to give him his presence we'll take you from each other through the world unless he'll take you into John he'll take you across he will be like hey guy he will reveal the heart of the King to you he will tell you specifically exactly what you need to die to he will tell you what to lay on the altar of incense amen and when you lay those things on the altar of incense when you're willing to die to everything your theology your opinions your everything your aspirations your hopes when you're willing to die to everything that you think you are anyway because I can tell you and guarantee you and this guy's Rivera is wrong here man because this world ain't designed to make you know who you are this world isn't designed the Society Hollywood everything you know Alleluia is not designed to show you your true identity only hallelujah amen God's in a chamberlin Amen hallelujah but you see it's not a human it's God inside a man hallelujah it's a pillar of fire Amen if you get into his presence and the crust comes off your head and the veil lifts off and you start to see who you are Amen he starts to tell you he starts to say hi to these things died to their ambition in your life this might be the tiniest little thing that's holding you back from the Holy Ghost the tiniest little thing and if you just get in its presence and you go down in yeah you listen to a sermon Amen you listen to a message or something because you're in his presence that changes everything Alleluia it changes the whole thing a man you're not just listening to learn something now a man you're not just sitting there warming up you Amen but you're actually you're connected hallelujah sometimes you even know what the preacher is gonna say NYX because you're in you're in the channel amen I remember sitting there a while ago and I said I just felt this thing how I mean why can't I enjoyed the sermon just as much as the preacher Amen hallelujah get into it amen hallelujah lay aside everything else we've all got troubles we've all got worries we've all got pressures and laying aside just forget it for now a man God will help you and you'll be better off if you get in his presence Amen hallelujah amen everyone will be better off because you're in his presence you know and he starts to reveal to you these are the little things you know the prophecies that when you get into that place this is all mine all of the portals of denomination becomes marked as a kabob all of that you start to see things as God sees them louia you start to see them with the clarity of the mind of Christ when you get in his presence hallelujah this is true Saints this is true and I encourage you young people amen anyone get in his presence hallelujah oh my I want to read a quote from uniting time and sign says are nuts questions and answers 64 now that's your birth path that's what you are a natural man or a natural woman but when you're born again that's not the outside conscience the outside is what you see taste for your smelling here but the inside of that is what you really are now this is less out here Satan tempts you and knocks you around every way here and I tell you you know without the anger without being in his presence if there's people dwelling in the wilderness right now and you're tossed to and fro because the the the anchors not inside yet you need to get in his presence because you need the clarity of thought you need that message that you need to look up and see that star to take you across the Jordan remember Israel could not cross Jordan outside of Joshua's mrs. ministry there was no way that God was going to open that Jordan amen and I tell you Satan and list in time he's flooded the banks of Georgia there is it's not humanly possible to cross it anymore there's a smoke come out of the pit of hell blocked out the Sun there is no way that a denominational person can clearly see in front of them they might find themselves bit close correctly out of Egypt in the wilderness but that's as far as they can go without the prophetic ministry of the seller they cannot cross over Jordan because you see the ministry that follow Joshua amen the fivefold ministry is anointed to take you across the door amen because they've come under their prophetic anointing of Joshua's ministry to take the people across Amen hallelujah and in 1960 God commissioned William Branham under the Joshua Commission he pointed to Joshua one and said as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee take my people from Kadesh Barnea into the Promised Land because there's a true baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting for them amen hallelujah the king that kept in the sword drawn king with an open book in his hands going to come down hallelujah he's gonna descend into their lives and he's gonna take over hallelujah he's gonna take over my goodness amen he's gonna take over and he's gonna see this foot on the sea in the earth of your life and gonna sub to the earth amen all the troubles all the tossed turn fries us my loner will finish a man your coming to rest hallelujah you're coming to the peace but not just peace amen it's war it's the beginning of another war it's the beginning of the war where the King comes into your heart hallelujah and then he starts killing your enemies he man kills that one Alleluia he breaks down the hardest concrete walls that you could never break a man to release Rahab out of your life amen to release that woman that was stuck that's you amen you were stuck with out there Amen Alleluia amen I'll just keep reading now Satan just tips you and knocks you around every way here but now let's say I hear Satan just tipped you off sorry down here what's going on here sorry pushing buttons [Music] my butt down here he can't do it unless you let him do it for in there and here you have got faith and faith don't come from the outer contours at reasons but in faith there is no reason you got it from God and you know it's there and it care how much it looks wrong you still know it's right amen don't you know it's right you know it's right hey man I know it's right amen because it's been revealed amen my life was anchored hallelujah I'm in divine fellowship they men hallelujah I can see a Garden of Eden being formed in me I can see any dinner condition inside my life they may hallelujah because God has planted it because God declared he would do it Amen when the Redeemer shall come to Zion things start changing a man when that that son of a second Adam comes down boom and he sits his feet in the heart of your earth hallelujah you know his things start to change from there he starts to destroy your enemies they may hallelujah seems like we're going that way again so he starts to destroy your enemies he starts to slow them down amen if you read Zechariah 14 you will see the picture of what happens when you get the Holy Ghost you will see what happens when you get the Holy Ghost in your heart now I'm not talking about an anointing or a fizzy feeling I'm talking about the king hallelujah I'm talking about the captain of the host a man the one that will lead your life into an adoption amen the one that will give you all things Amen that one

ball will fall away anyway here it is okay alright I'll finish on this so to be married to the second Adam Christ the word you must separate yourself from by death separate yourself by death amen from your first denominational husband Amen hallelujah you must because there isn't one of them that can take all the Word of God not one they can't take it they haven't got it a more sure word of prophecy they haven't got it they've got a golden calf and they've got some truth inside of it but that's not the whole thing amen you know what that makes that a the tree of knowledge of good and evil that's hybrid it cannot bring life the seed can only have another demon inside it that's why they go crazy when they leave this message that's why they do stupid things because there there's a hybrid sword in there and Satan gets inside that thought but if you've got God's thinking exciting can't get inside God you've got the word the word is pure if the word is pure do you know who spirits inside network amen God's Spirit is in that word that's true it's a true sure prophecy and we knit yes why Peter you see they've got a sure prophecy because when that sure prophecy and you receive that and the crust is off your head and the amnesia is gone and the bails off and you're in the spirit and you're in the presence of God and you know you're walking wherever you are Egypt wilderness Kadesh Barnea or now you're in the land with the holy dove he's still gonna stay in the spirit because you can still gum under the enemies you know attacks you're not object in any place apart from when you're hidden and leaning on the chest at Jesus you know when you're leaning on his chest nothing can touch you hallelujah the only way the enemy can ever try and get you is lie to you and try and pull you off the chest of the Lord Jesus because that is the position of the believer I'm telling you now and it may sound very deep but it's the position of the believer he's calling us to that place that's where John was just before you know the Ascension just John was there you are like John and you are called to his chest Hey and you so glad you're called to the warmth of the body of the word of God a man just to lean on him amen hallelujah John heard a voice saying come up higher have you heard it have you heard the voice calling you higher a man calling you out of the church Ages calling you out of the holy place calling you into the Holy of Holies amen a place no matter how much of a stick you may be or were hallelujah you know when you get into that place God had a vision of you and his mind before the foundation of the world God had a vision of a stick that win and the presence of God amen he didn't see a stick hallelujah he didn't see a dry old stick that couldn't speak he saw a tree with fruit amen and that's what he sees in you hallelujah did you hear a voice did you hear a voice a man saying go and take the book out of his hand go and eat the word is there a thirst in your life don't squash it out amen you water that what are the camels that will take you to the very person that you're looking for hey man hallelujah to see with your eyes amen Orry to God amen hallelujah that's the position of the believers seated in heavenly places I can't think of a more heavenly place and on his chest in that place we john wetton hallelujah out of the church age is out of the fussing of the chipmunks on the ground amen out of all the waving to and fro and this preacher coming up there and they go that way and in this one that way and all those churches and everything hello the way out of an instability but in testability into eternity amen I can declare to you with all my heart that my soul is an eternity amen my soul has got eternity inside it amen and then eternity is growing and growing and grow it's pushing out amen pushing out all the darkness all the complexes all the things that robbed me of my blessings took away my privileges all those things are getting destroyed little by little amen glory to God okay so yeah just show me where that one is that oh you say mine the other fellow says his - this is now the denomination's you know they're all saying they've got the word just show me where it's at oh you say mine the other fellow says has to put them together and you find out they're both wrong soon as you denominator read revelation 17 so you see you've got to be dead dead dead man really did I'm talking absolutely God completely like at the end of it all at the end of everything that you ever thought that you would be or weren't ah amen that's the only place for the believer to be if they want to go beyond the veil and unless you go think this is something you catch catch this unless you go beyond the veil all you'll ever see is the veil it's true you must go beyond the veil but you can't unless you have a gift cemani and the very angels that care them out or bring you in they'll come down when your dime Alleluia they'll minister to you they'll say come up higher a may a man you'll see the angels descending in ascending upon the son of man and what ministry are we under right now what ministry are we under the son of man but if you want to see angels descending and ascending it's time to die it's time to die young people amen it's time to give it all up let it all go and for us too sometimes we just start holding things you know we start holding on to things and it can keep us from our privilege it can keep us on the earth but we've got wings the devil wants to clip every stick and feather so you can't fly and then you know I have O'Neill start to just pull them all out but you can't you know you just stay in his prison stand the presence of God keep pushing them back when he starts to attack on you you just push them push the devil back you've got privilege you've got Authority it's a war don't think you're ever gonna not war you after war but war in a state arrest War II Men from the chest of the word ma you know there's some people that are just warm people it warm they're just warm people they just you just like being around them is a nice atmosphere amen I believe it's because they're leaning on his chest and they're getting warm from the body of the word you know the Word of God is warming them up they're listening to the beating heart of the king amen they're coming into the rhythm they're right up there you know they're walking they're hearing they're pre-empting the preachers sermons because they're in the same Channel a man they've been studying the same things the night before they're praying in the same vein of thought this is God don't put their to work by yourself this is for you don't think it's too supernatural for you you're a supernatural being amen hallelujah claim you're a privilege amen hallelujah amen amen now I'm not speaking to this local assembly I'm speaking all together across the nation you must be dead to your first husband if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination you're an adulteress listen to this this is quite amazing you are Laodicea man that puts the person that's there in Laodicea but we're in a bright age there is a in the soul your soul the revelation of the vision of heaven for you is above then it's open to revelation 4 of Christ leaning on his chest but here you are lay out to see her if you staying in that place if you're not willing to die to everything those little livings inside your mind that you hold on to will keep you in Laodicea they have to all be gone and then these things will start to make sense to you you'll see beyond the veil you'll look at that picture over there and you will see a pillar of fire anyway you will know that pillar fires the one that blinded Paul on the way to Damascus you'll know that he let the people in the wilderness amen and you'll know that the gifts of the fivefold ministry that are preaching now and every other gift to and measure as being led by that same pillar of fire amen and that pillar of fire is opening up his word he's fulfilling himself he's making it flesh he's bringing things off he's making it happen in your life he's revealing your birth path your supernatural birth paths until the redemption of your body amen there is a path for each one of us and we will not we will not walk at path without being in his presence without having a relationship without leaning on its chest when you're leaning on his chest he's the one you're the one in whispers to you're the one he speaks to Judas in the room in the upper room you know the disciples all look to John because John was on his chest and they said John ask this is your place this is where you are think of this now his revelation for where John got caught up you see you are John right John would have got caught up in there and seen himself because there was the 24 elders there you know 12 of the Apostles he would have gone isn't John man he would have been excited there I am but you see put yourself there where else are you gonna go they're all complete this the twelve disciples of Paul replace Judas and there's the twelve Patriots and here's the king he says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne where are you sitting together well them now hallelujah don't put that in the future yes there will be more fulfillment of it but there's a partial fulfillment now spiritually speaking you're seated together with them in heavenly places far above all principalities powers and rulers of darkness so when the enemy comes in like a flood hallelujah just remember the Redeemer has come to Zion the Redeemer has come to stay and he will raise a standard against every flood of the enemy you just need to speak and take you know just stand having done all the stand stand now I'm not speaking oh you remember he says who are you he says a few still you know if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination if you're United to Christ and still married to a denomination you are an adulteress you are Laodicea there's something very key in there I don't know if you caught that but if you are united to Christ so there you see you can still be united you can still be walking with them you can still be getting in his presence but you haven't come to me into the fullness yet you're having a relationship with God maybe in Egypt you had a are coming through the Red Sea you're having a relationship with God in the wilderness or at kadish and he's been trying to get your own but you know you maybe you've been walking in a natural realm for too long and across the stuff for me tonight the rock is here the rock is here he rub your head on it you just pray to him ask him it's not something that you have to grovel it's not something you have to work up simple the power of God is in this room to rub your head against amen so just get the crust off the eagle you know who knows the story of the bald eagle they get crusts on their head and they have to go up to the rock and they rub it off amen and that renews their youth amen hallelujah that's exactly what needs to happen sometimes to an eagle they get a bit of crust on me and they've been living too naturally now naturalizing everything and it's time to get into his presence and that crust come off hello Louie yeah you don't have to earn it now you just have to pray ask him just lay it all down Lord is anything in my life that is stopping this there anything in me that I need to surrender for Lord I'm going to look to the star that you reflected yourself on I'm gonna read this message I'm gonna listen I'm gonna listen with all my heart I'm gonna lay everything aside until I hear that voice bar in a voice that reveals the path to my new birth that shows me like Esther how what to lay down because you see the others they died to what they thought they should right they died - all sorts of things they didn't they probably you know they these are the were virgins in the harem they would have laid down this and laid down there and laid down these things that they used to be to try a new identity in their mind they thought this is probably what the King likes and I'm talking details now I'm not you know there are people you know when I'm talking about my new details to us but to God their major to the king they made all the difference because you see that messenger that if it's the head that message that she came under clothed her in the heart of the king when the King saw Esther he saw a reflection of himself a man he saw himself when he fell in love hallelujah amen because she clothed herself she humbled herself she didn't get all angry when the Minister Minister person bettan it they will she wasn't carnal when he said things that were challenging to her she said okay because she you know and tightener in the spirit she was in the spirit of the moment she was in the spirit of the vision hallelujah there was a faith inside her that said this man has the truth hallelujah and if I just listen hallelujah all these others trying their best and they might get very close but still every way a man we have a more sure word of prophecy and you mix the all that together and you're gonna get a date on a man in your heart because you know what your you will be it will be revealed to you now you might just be carnal and you hear the message and it's just another message and the dibbles telling you oh look you've got that wrong and that wrong and everything like that but if you get in the spirit and God starts to reveal to you you'll hear a voice behind the voice and it will build a more sure word of prophecy in your life amen hallelujah in the Daystar will rise in your heart amen amen amen everything that you thought you were will be completely changed hey man because this is what he does he comes into a heart that is full of destruction he doesn't come into a nice place look at all the pictures in the Bible look at the time when they came over Jordan and come into a nice place the captain with the sword in his hand and come down to Paradise amen he came down to war amen when Jesus comes again when the earth gets her baptism the earth itself now talking about the whole earth she gets a baptism of Holy Ghost I mean Jesus himself and we're with him comes down to Jerusalem he doesn't come into a nice Jerusalem full of happy people he comes into a place that has all sit to destroy him and you and me whole world against and there's atomic warfare there's everything that people can possibly do whatever advancement of weaponry everything that's going to be against us and he just speaks the word god and it probably be something real silly hey man just to rub it in his face hallelujah like it was for Array him you know it was a it was silly no I don't mean that in a bad way but it wasn't like what men would think his men thought it was foolish but God thought it was great amen and the spiritual man thinks that's great hallelujah no one would have come up with that idea let's march around the walls mn and shout and humiliation these people probably laughing down the walls look at these people but they're probably scared at the same time amen hallelujah amen you see it's different that's gonna be like that and it's like that in your life you can't figure it all out don't try you just get in his presence say man I think that's been the thing right that's your privilege get in his presence stay in his presence and if you fall out of something and have a bit of a failure just go straight back and enjoy your ten minutes if that's all you can give for now just give them ten minutes don't strive and thank him man I've only got I'm only giving him ten minutes of my day and I'm not saying that you should just give him ten minutes I think you should give him more I won't think I always you know but it's not a time limit it's not time pressure but the main thing is that you enjoy it enjoy it if you don't enjoy it it's not even point doing it because you're not even entering and you're just having this duty my duty I've got to pray for this person and pray for Aunt Sally and pray for Grandma no that's not it it's more than that enjoy your prayer life enjoy your relationship enjoy the sermon don't strive if you're not getting everything just enjoy what God speaks to you get into a state of mind where you can actually enjoy and just say Lord speak to me I'm not going to try and learn everything we don't need to try and learn everything and try and know all knowledge because it can pop up if it's just knowledge but if you sit in a state of expectation and you're just resting and eating with them amen hallelujah and just let him speak to you and say Lord what do you have for me today hallelujah just go into that rest into that place your prayer life will become more enjoyable amen your prayer life will be better amen it's not a duty it's a privilege it's an honor that's the most enjoyable part of our life it's communion with the king but you see a lot of personalities and mine included wants to have a performance-based relationship you know and you've got to do a certain amount and if you don't you get frustrated well I don't do that anymore thankfully God showed me so much about those things but now it's just like you know if I only have a little bit of time I'm going to not get pressured and try and do everything I want to get in his presence I want to hear from him amen this is the key the key to wherever you're at right now get in his presence amen get in his presence hallelujah amen it's not a carrot too far away from you he wants you more than you want him he wants to be in your with you he's he sent angels and messages and prophets and everything for thousands of years hallelujah he said all the human race all that's been out of his Bible after all these prophecies she loves you to show you what he wants to do for you right now a man is pointed at all at you you are the star of his show a man hallelujah amen oh my wait you know when we recognize these things you know just all this other stuff and duty and striving and and and all that just starts to fade into the glory of that love that was expressed when he for the joy that was set before him you know he was thinking he loves you he did that for you you know Louie amen hallelujah amen sorry I'll read this now and then we're close a church across the nation we're following Jesus Christ the word to be in the bride you have to be remarried to the Word of God which is Christ in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us as long as you hold to men's tradition of denominations you could be walking in this message and still holding to traditional thinking and if you are you will never go further then until you get rid of all of that stuff and lay it all down because it's just tree of knowledge and some of it may be right but you just got to be willing to lay it all down because God needs to rebuild the image in your mind he needs to rebuild and reveal the image in his season not your season not you striving and comparing all the quotes and scriptures or together yes it's nice to do those things as well but it's not just it's not you learning it's God teaching that's God leading he has a path and he wants to reveal it to units and that he will reveal the paths of life and the presence of the Lord is the fullness of joy in his presence the path will be revealed to you your path amen no matter where you're in as long as you hold to man's tradition of denominations you are called in God's Word an adulteress as long as you're a denominational Creed seeker belonging to a denominational Church that denies the word you are an adulteress what the Bible said Jesus said you cannot serve two gods at the same time you either serve God or Mammon Mammon is the world he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in him that is one of the most serious in severe scriptures of the Bible you know it really is if we if we're sincere and we really look at that we should really look at that this is something to really look at the word and see your reflection do you love the things of this world you know the love of God is Jesus Christ the love of God is the passion of Christ to have you it says love revealed to you perfect love casts out all fear you how I don't ask you this question in a practical manner how could how could you have the very second atom in your heart and an eat dinner condition and actually even how could there be any room for any other love how could be be if your whole life is completely saturated by an idiot condition and Christ is in the heart there's neither room you think of that his love so strong so measureless and strong or my love that took him tortured hair pulled out you know blood falling on the hanging on the cross I loved so mighty so great and so holy how could any other love be in there the seed of God can't be in him the same time the love of God the love of the world is in there when the seed of God is operating through you that's the Word of God the love of the world can't be in there at the same time it's so simple amen alleluiah it's just hip the musicians come amen let's sing Word of God ever true changing me changing you and then I'll invite brother Ben to come hallelujah [Music] [Music] with this before we sing why the music's playing nicely if there's anybody that is they know that they haven't got that second atom in their life whether they're out in these homes that are listening or in this room anybody the rock of all ages is here if it may be somebody in this room that has hot crust on me here and they have been filled with the Holy Spirit but there's managed to get crust on and this is your moment you can have it crust remove tonight now right where you're sitting standing worshiping this is not a altar call where there's no need for an article because the King of Kings as wherever you want him to be wherever you call him to he's knocking he's knocking at your door young people he's knocking on the door of your will on the door of your selfishness on the door of you thinking who you are of your old identities knocking on the door and he wants to tell you he wants to bring you to his office and he wants to set you down and tell you that the parents that you would naturally want to aren't your real parents it wants to tell you that you have a different parent that owns everything and now you're in an identity crisis now you need to put on a new identity he wants to tell you that if you're willing to open the door you can put on an identity that will speak things into existence a different identity completely and tonight right now you can have that the Lord is here to change you the Lord is here to show you and to reveal your path if there's something in your life that are stopping you from getting in the presence of God the Lord is here to help you he has here to unblock channels he is here to bring clarity he is here to dissolve doubts this is an opportunity for you to have all your doubts dissolved by the king if you're willing to humble yourself and lay it all down at his feet you can have the Holy Ghost tonight right now you can have him if you're willing to lay it all on the altar the altar of incense so that the incense of their old nature is burned away washed down the river Jordan into the Dead Sea washed away because there's a marriage you're being caught if you're willing you can lay it down as we sing you can pray to him as we see however you want young people you're not too young it's your night tonight as well if you're willing to lay it all down anybody in this room anybody on the sound of this voice it's your time amen ho all my people
