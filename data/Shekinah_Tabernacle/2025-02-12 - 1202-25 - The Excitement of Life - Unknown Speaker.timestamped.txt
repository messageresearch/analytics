[25:56] know I I love serving the lord we you
[25:58] know no matter what would happen each
[26:00] day and how it may appear I I have
[26:03] confidence that you know when we commit
[26:05] our life to the Lord and we the great
[26:07] Shepherd is leading us that he's never
[26:08] going to lead us astray and that he's
[26:10] always got our best interest in mind you
[26:12] know no it doesn't matter we we can
[26:15] begin to rest and as we go on life's
[26:17] journey and we go through things and we
[26:19] always come out the other side okay we
[26:20] start to have more faith we realize well
[26:22] if I came out that out of that one okay
[26:24] I'll come out of this one okay you know
[26:26] we we begin to trust more and and maybe
[26:29] we don't get so worried when things
[26:30] aren't going the way that it might
[26:32] appear that they should be we just think
[26:34] oh it's all right Lord I remember when I
[26:37] um when we we moved here we were in a
[26:40] house for maybe three or four months and
[26:41] then we had to move
[26:43] out
[26:45] and we had five kids and five children
[26:49] and a small I don't like saying kid
[26:51] sometimes because it's like a baby
[26:53] goat so like don't take anything off
[26:56] that that's just in my brain
[26:59] five children in um a small zoo I think
[27:01] we had some goats then we had chickens
[27:05] and dogs and cats and fish and any all
[27:09] these creepy crawly things rabbits I
[27:11] think the rabbits probably got killed by
[27:12] the dogs but um and for the life of me
[27:15] we could not find a single place to live
[27:17] anywhere because nobody wanted a a like
[27:20] a tribe in a
[27:23] zoo and it was so funny trying to get a
[27:25] place you know we were we were looking I
[27:27] remember brother and you been with me I
[27:28] think I've shared with some of you but
[27:30] every place I looked at said no no no
[27:33] everywhere I looked man and and I said
[27:35] to we look for replace and then I'd say
[27:37] I'd say to Brother Andy you watch this
[27:38] bro this will be a no you watch this
[27:40] it'll be a no and then the next day come
[27:42] back and no no no no and um I remember
[27:45] the day we still had
[27:47] nowhere um we'd be going to the prayer
[27:49] meetings and they'd be praying oh Lord
[27:51] give brother ISAC a house you know
[27:53] sister Shannon but I'm sure on the back
[27:54] of their mind they're thinking man
[27:55] what's this brother done you know not
[27:57] the Lord's not providing
[28:00] he must have done something wrong
[28:07] confess you know some of you were
[28:08] thinking that
[28:12] now and the day came where we had to
[28:14] move out we had nowhere I thought man we
[28:16] got nowhere to go so we had to pack all
[28:18] our stuff up and throw it on a storage
[28:20] unit said to Brother Andy were moving
[28:22] into your place bro we got nowhere to go
[28:25] nowhere I think brother alre was helping
[28:27] us move cuz he was down for the weekend
[28:29] but fortunately for me it was a time
[28:31] where I did have faith I didn't waver we
[28:34] were moving our stuff and stores you
[28:35] know it's all right the Lord's got
[28:36] somewhere perfectly lined up for us it's
[28:38] all right everything's going to be all
[28:39] right I can't say mo like that in case I
[28:42] don't think oh this brother just goes
[28:43] through trials and things like it's
[28:45] nothing you know but that time I did and
[28:49] um I said it's all right well the Lord's
[28:51] got some sort of plan in mind I've got
[28:52] no idea what it is because this doesn't
[28:54] make any sense to me we're going to have
[28:55] to put all this stuff in storage and
[28:56] then go and live at brother Andy's
[28:58] then about two weeks later the guy we
[29:00] would that we dealt with to get that
[29:01] house he he gave me a ring and he said I
[29:03] found a neat place for
[29:04] you um but it's an unusual setup but
[29:08] come and have a look at it so we went
[29:09] out to the aatar was there and it was
[29:11] this amazing place and 180 acres of land
[29:14] and just really good and it was fully
[29:16] furnished with stuff house load of stuff
[29:19] and he said look the funny setup is this
[29:20] these guys just finished fully
[29:21] renovating this place and it was all go
[29:24] and um but then things happened they had
[29:27] to all move up to Oakland um and they're
[29:30] renting out there and living living with
[29:32] their parents and things like that but
[29:33] they said um the only catches they want
[29:36] someone to live here for about two or 3
[29:38] months with all of their
[29:40] stuff um well they found a place up
[29:42] there and then when all this when you
[29:43] could um when they found a place up
[29:46] there then they would move all of their
[29:47] stuff up there and on the walls were all
[29:49] these Christian scriptures and things so
[29:51] it turns out this was a Christian family
[29:53] and they that they had gotten a
[29:55] situation where they they you understand
[29:58] the picture like they they had to go up
[30:00] there and then they said Lord we need
[30:01] someone to move into our house and use
[30:02] all of our furniture for about 3 months
[30:05] well we find somewhere and we said to
[30:07] the guy well that works out well for us
[30:08] cuz I just finished putting all my stuff
[30:09] in
[30:11] storage so we're ready to move man we
[30:15] moving tomorrow our whole belong our
[30:16] whole life is in the back of the
[30:18] car and we were there for 10 years you
[30:21] know it was such an an amazing um time
[30:24] but you know even you know you just the
[30:28] Lord's always got some sort of plan I'm
[30:29] glad at the time I didn't think oh no
[30:31] Lord you know I've done all this for you
[30:32] and then you put me in that situation I
[30:33] going know where to live and you know he
[30:36] had a plan all the way through amen um
[30:40] okay so the um the scripture that I the
[30:42] thought that I have want to speak on
[30:44] tonight is a a subject called the
[30:46] excitement of
[30:48] Life the excitement of Life who's
[30:50] excited about life if you're honest
[30:53] sometimes you're
[30:54] not you're very dis excited about life
[30:56] if that's a word
[30:58] you know but I just want to talk about
[31:01] this and maybe maybe talk first about
[31:03] the this natural path of excitement that
[31:06] we go through as now this is just now
[31:07] I'm going to talk first as just a human
[31:09] being because we we go on this natural
[31:11] path of
[31:12] excitement as as our life unfolds um
[31:15] some of you are still on that at the
[31:17] early stages of the paast and some
[31:18] people are going to be near the end of
[31:20] it which is a very different stage than
[31:22] than it is at the start but but there is
[31:25] a path of we're talking natural
[31:26] excitement now and we get into the
[31:28] spiritual side but it's we're going to
[31:30] talk natural excitement which is you
[31:31] know you're excited you're happy about
[31:32] something you're enthusiastic it gives
[31:34] you energy it's you know excitement you
[31:35] know when you're excited about something
[31:36] you're kind of
[31:37] like like I remember oh Jesus is not
[31:40] here tonight but we were going to go
[31:41] hunting early one morning and I said
[31:44] I'll wake you up at like 5:30 or
[31:46] something you know we'll go early and
[31:48] this little guy was so excited about it
[31:49] he was about 8 I think or seven and I
[31:53] went to his room and woke him up and he
[31:55] hopped straight out of bed boots on
[31:58] pansan jacket everything he was ready to
[31:59] go man he stepped on his whole clothes
[32:01] so he could just get up and
[32:02] gone that's how excited he was to
[32:06] go so on our natural path of life we got
[32:09] like say 0 to 10 you know it's quite a
[32:11] it's a it's an exciting little time when
[32:13] you live you know you just everything's
[32:14] new to you but you actually don't know
[32:15] that you're young and you don't know you
[32:17] even exist really to you get a bit older
[32:18] you're like well that was my childhood
[32:19] just then but you know you just sort of
[32:22] it just comes upon you without you
[32:23] really knowing that it's there you know
[32:25] cuz you you understand you realize later
[32:27] on that my childhood
[32:29] well you know you're alive but you don't
[32:31] really perceive it as much I was having
[32:33] a a fun time looking at I was going to
[32:35] get pictures of little children but I
[32:36] was having a fun time looking at
[32:37] pictures of excited little animals you
[32:39] know cuz you know you see a little lamb
[32:40] jumping out in the field you know it's
[32:42] little things little children are so
[32:44] excited you know they're just excited
[32:45] about everything everything things
[32:47] excite them really easily like you go
[32:49] boo and they get excited they're like w
[32:51] this is or you you know hide behind
[32:53] there and sneak out they're just so
[32:54] excited that you snuck out to them you
[32:55] know or if it's almost dinner time
[32:57] they're so excited all dinner you know
[32:59] it's like everything is exciting they're
[33:01] just they're just so excited about life
[33:03] and it's such an amazing thing with
[33:04] that's what I love about children
[33:05] they're just everything excites them
[33:07] some adults you know they just like
[33:09] nothing excites them anymore you know
[33:10] but little children are just they're
[33:12] just so excited you know everything's
[33:14] just new and fresh and it's just it's
[33:16] nice to be around like here's your
[33:18] little beer Cubs you know they're just
[33:20] excited F fighting you know playing and
[33:23] the mom's
[33:25] like I had so much fun looking at these
[33:27] you know who's
[33:28] this you can sort of see who's more
[33:31] excited than the
[33:34] other or this I think a lot of dads
[33:36] could relate to this is keep
[33:41] playing dad's like I'm done
[33:44] man the excitement wore off 20 years ago
[33:50] no this next one is very funny you wait
[33:54] till you see this one boom
[33:57] [Laughter]
[34:01] I think that's the dad he's just done
[34:07] man this might be the mom I
[34:10] think but one of them is more more
[34:13] excited than the other and this is a
[34:14] natural way that life would unfold you
[34:16] know the when you're young you're
[34:17] excited when you get older you're not as
[34:19] excited about the things that they're
[34:21] excited about you know
[34:28] then you get to this funny age like 10
[34:30] to 12 it's kind of like a you sort of
[34:31] transition from like being a kind of
[34:33] like a little kid but you're not really
[34:34] like a teenager you're sort of in this
[34:37] it's quite a neat stage you know it's
[34:39] quite a quite
[34:40] a I I put here just because it is a fact
[34:43] if you're a boy you're kind of like
[34:45] this you're you're not really a kid but
[34:47] you're not really independent you're not
[34:48] really and you are old enough to be
[34:51] Mischief but young enough to be
[34:52] naive you know that's just that it's
[34:54] quite a neat little age 11 10 11 12 like
[34:57] a lot of movies or books are about if
[35:00] they want to capture something about
[35:02] that age they they they hone in on this
[35:03] age here cuz it's like they can still
[35:05] make the boy or girl a bit goofy but
[35:07] then they can still be serious they just
[35:09] sort of just stuck in the middle you
[35:11] know because when you get to a teenage
[35:12] Hood it's a bit more serious you're a
[35:12] bit more the realities of Life are there
[35:15] bit more and you know but when you were
[35:15] a kid you they they wouldn't understand
[35:17] these older things so it's quite a funny
[35:19] little
[35:20] um age and then 13 to 17 you're still
[35:24] like you're still excited about things
[35:26] at this age you're the ex hasn't gone
[35:28] yet though right we're always kind of
[35:29] excited even in your teenage years
[35:30] you're still excited about things you
[35:31] just go a little bit weird for a while
[35:34] you
[35:37] know like you're not really you should
[35:40] be really excited but you like try not
[35:41] to
[35:43] shot but in your heart you know you are
[35:46] you're so excited but your friends you
[35:49] look at your friend and if your friend
[35:50] is an excited man you're not going to
[35:51] move a
[35:56] muscle that's the truth you
[35:59] know all the kids are going nah
[36:02] [Laughter]
[36:04] man but when you kind of get over that
[36:07] you get over those your little
[36:08] insecurities and you know you're like H
[36:10] you know who cares if my friend doesn't
[36:12] it's not excited I am you know I'm
[36:14] excited girls showout a bit more than
[36:16] guys till I notice they sort of show a
[36:17] bit more excitement but you get to this
[36:20] age where you're let's let's say 18 to
[36:22] about 28 you're
[36:24] actually you are old enough to if I put
[36:28] it here you are old enough and
[36:29] independent enough to to try things but
[36:32] you never have you know so you now have
[36:36] this you you now have this excitement in
[36:39] your life because suddenly you can go
[36:41] and do a lot of things but and they're
[36:42] all new you know all the things that you
[36:45] that you could go and do are new for you
[36:48] because you can go and do them yourself
[36:49] it's a very very exciting time it's like
[36:52] it's just everything is exciting you
[36:54] know like uh understand what I mean by
[36:58] and you've all been there you know it's
[36:59] just you but I'll just talk real quick
[37:02] about this this emotion called
[37:05] excitement have you got your thinking
[37:06] caps on your natural thinking
[37:10] caps so the this is the way scientists
[37:13] and psychologist would determine this
[37:16] the understanding of this emotion called
[37:19] excitement because it is an emotion it's
[37:20] still like a state of emotional and it
[37:22] could last longer or shorter but one
[37:24] dimension they call it
[37:26] Valance and that that's that's whether
[37:29] the
[37:30] emotion is positive or negative or
[37:33] Pleasant or unpleasant so you've got
[37:34] this is it going to be positive or
[37:37] negative and then the next one is called
[37:41] um arousal that means is it activating
[37:44] does it bring you up or pull you down so
[37:48] so these are the two sort of things that
[37:50] that affect excitement so with that in
[37:53] mind you'd say you'd say ex excitement
[37:55] has a positive uh Valance like it's a
[37:58] positive thing and then it's got high
[38:01] arousal like you feel good and it's like
[38:03] yeah you know so that's that that
[38:05] creates this this emotion to make you
[38:08] excited so and if you look at it like
[38:11] calmness is it's a positive thing but
[38:13] you've got very low arousal you're
[38:15] you're calm you know so it's on the
[38:17] positive side but it doesn't really
[38:18] you're not like yippee you're actually
[38:19] like wow this is so nice I'm just
[38:21] sitting down and looking out at the view
[38:23] and relaxing you know it's it's a but
[38:24] it's still positive uh so then
[38:28] anger would be a very negative uh like a
[38:31] feeling but bearing in mind those two
[38:35] the what it does in your body with
[38:37] excitement or anger or that it's
[38:39] actually almost the same thing it's
[38:39] cortisol that comes into you it's
[38:41] actually the same it's a strange thing
[38:43] like your heart beats a bit faster your
[38:45] things happen to you but the same thing
[38:47] happens to you it's just the way your
[38:48] mind perceives it if your mind perceives
[38:50] it's exciting you'll get excited if it
[38:52] perceives you're angry it'll do it that
[38:54] way so you actually have this it's not
[38:56] like oh your angry I'll give you a
[38:58] different shot of stuff you know you get
[39:00] the same shot which there's a lesson in
[39:02] that too because people could take the
[39:04] same thing a different way uh boredom or
[39:07] depression is negative Valance and low
[39:11] arousal so it's so it's all around bad
[39:14] at least anger you kind of like you
[39:16] fight up about something but but
[39:18] depression or boredom you're just you're
[39:20] down and you're just and everything's
[39:22] negative and it's just low Rouser you're
[39:23] just like you got basically zero
[39:26] excitement in life
[39:28] zero and because depression brings you
[39:30] zero excitement you're not when you when
[39:32] you get really depressed you're not
[39:33] excited about anything at all nothing
[39:35] excites
[39:36] you um this is one last bit of study
[39:39] here then we're going to move go back to
[39:40] where we were um I talked about this but
[39:43] arouser what's called the hypothalamus
[39:45] controls this response through the um
[39:48] autonomic nervous system which is
[39:50] responsible for regulating Baseline body
[39:52] functions like breathing blood pressure
[39:54] and heart rate feeling excited or
[39:55] feeling anxious is actually the same
[39:57] sensation both send a rush of cortisol
[39:59] to your brain so it's the same thing it
[40:01] just it just sends it up when it thinks
[40:03] that it should and then Valance is in
[40:04] the meantime another part of the brain
[40:06] the prefrontal cortex is involved in
[40:08] processing the context of the situation
[40:10] to determine Valance if it's a positive
[40:12] or negative thing or like you say like
[40:14] take like change if in your mind you're
[40:17] scared of
[40:18] change then when change comes it's going
[40:20] to shoot up this quarter all and things
[40:22] in you but you're going to take it as a
[40:24] negative thing because in your mind you
[40:25] think it's negative so you're you're
[40:26] going to be anxious oh no there's change
[40:28] right but if you like change then you're
[40:31] going to be excited about the change see
[40:34] that's the two that's is how this thing
[40:36] works so the way you perceive it in your
[40:38] mind is actually it affects how you take
[40:41] it okay so let's just cut back to this
[40:43] now life now becomes full of new
[40:44] experiences when you're you know you're
[40:46] 18 19 20 you know you you travel to a
[40:49] new place because remember every place

[43:22] admit it it's exciting man W it's like
[43:24] oh this and they talk to me
[43:27] we made oure
[43:31] contact and then you can't talk and
[43:33] you're so nervous you're like
[43:37] uh hey um and then and then you think
[43:41] should I have said hey was that the
[43:43] wrong thing to say I should have said
[43:45] hello they're going to think I'm silly
[43:47] CU I said hey oh no now it's bad I
[43:49] haven't seen anything for about 20
[43:50] seconds and that's awkward you know it's
[43:53] like but you know if it do all slowly
[43:55] eventuate you get so it's so exciting
[43:57] you
[43:58] know and it's and there's a because you
[44:02] have more of life ahead of you than be
[44:03] than behind you and you have you have
[44:06] opportunity and things that options that
[44:09] you don't that slowly fade as your life
[44:11] goes on you get less and less options
[44:13] and people want to give you less and
[44:15] less options as well and so that's a and
[44:18] you'll find that universities and sports
[44:20] teams mainly universities they they
[44:21] major on this idea that oh look life is
[44:24] a hide is exciting come with us and you
[44:26] can be this and you can be that they
[44:27] major on that like all these Billboards
[44:28] like oh I am Fearless come with us and
[44:30] be fearless and and take on life you
[44:32] know they they they kind of in a sense
[44:34] they leverage off this idea that you're
[44:37] at the age where it's all exciting now
[44:38] you know they're not marketing towards a
[44:40] 60y old that has decided to go back to
[44:43] University you know they're not
[44:45] marketing they're marketing to a
[44:46] 20-year-old that's like got their life

[45:01] life is going to be real boring and just
[45:02] come here and work and then die and it's
[45:04] all over you know they they don't want
[45:05] to Market it like that it should be you
[45:08] know it should be a bit exciting or it's
[45:11] a new world learn to lead it you know
[45:13] it's it's always the thrust uh the power
[45:16] to change your world now these and these
[45:19] things are correct because you go into
[45:21] you you have hopes and you have dreams

[45:26] it's the beauty of Youth I'm not I'm I'm
[45:27] for it um in a natural sense like the
[45:31] because this is naturally how we
[45:32] progress you know in life and and all of
[45:35] these you know if you want to join the
[45:36] the Army they're saying be all you can
[45:38] be and they're trying to bring you in by
[45:39] giving you hope that it's going to be a

[46:05] on the buffet you
[46:07] know now I think that's a good thing
[46:10] that's a natural part of life but you
[46:12] know you can get older people that can
[46:13] sort of pour cold water on it all and
[46:14] say oh yeah yeah been there done that
[46:16] it's your first job you'll get sick of
[46:18] it soon enough oh yeah now you just
[46:21] studying year probably be a boring job
[46:22] or you know but but we shouldn't do that
[46:26] to young people you know it's their turn
[46:28] it's their turn to be excited and have
[46:29] fun in life and even if you know
[46:31] probably you know you're going to get
[46:32] sick of that after while say awesome man
[46:33] go yeah it's exciting because to them it
[46:35] is you know it's exciting this is a this
[46:37] is their turn to be excited we were
[46:39] excited when we were that age we enjoyed
[46:41] it hey it does Wayne but don't worry
[46:43] about it you don't need to tell them
[46:44] that let them let them go and enjoy it
[46:46] you know and and even Solomon perceived
[46:49] this process of excitement that's why he
[46:51] said Rejoice oh young man and thy youth
[46:53] or young woman and let thy heart cheer
[46:55] thee in the days of thy Youth and walk
[46:57] in the ways of thine heart and in the
[46:59] sight of Thine Eyes whatever you want to
[47:00] go and do just go and do it it's
[47:01] exciting for you you know but no there
[47:05] that for all these things God will bring
[47:06] the into judgment just do the right
[47:08] thing don't go off and sin but go off
[47:09] and have fun life is exciting go and do
[47:12] things go and experience things go go
[47:14] and travel go do this go do that sorry
[47:17] next month all the youth will be
[47:18] gone shouldn't say now don't
[47:21] travel no no but but it's a this is a
[47:25] natural way that we that
[47:27] lives are going to unfold and then you
[47:30] have maybe at about 2830 you get this
[47:34] thing happens called the downward
[47:36] spiral okay it's called this this little
[47:39] downward spiral that goes that suddenly
[47:42] things stop going up and things start
[47:43] going down in terms of your excitement
[47:45] about life the downward spiral who's
[47:48] who's who's who's who's slid done the
[47:51] downward spiral now and then no one
[47:53] wants to admit but you know you all are
[47:56] [Laughter]
[48:00] and that's the end of the sermon I'm
[48:02] [Laughter]
[48:06] done because the scripture we read at
[48:08] the start
[48:09] said remember now thy Creator in the
[48:11] days of thy youth well the evil days
[48:13] come not nor the years draw nigh when
[48:16] thou shalt say I have no pleasure in
[48:18] them I get zero excitement out of this
[48:22] anymore because I've done that for about
[48:25] 100 I've done that 100 times
[48:27] it's called the evil day this is now
[48:29] naturally our excitement how it would
[48:31] naturally go okay I'm not saying we go
[48:34] like that I'm just saying this is the
[48:35] natural progression of how it's going to
[48:36] go if it's l to take its natural course
[48:38] it's just like you shouldn't see a
[48:39] little forn being born that just sits
[48:41] there does nothing that thing's going to
[48:43] bounce around but probably not when it's
[48:45] older it's not going to bounce around
[48:47] you know it's a natural progression and
[48:48] this is a natural progression and
[48:50] there's a simple reason for it is that
[48:51] less things are new and more things are
[48:54] old you got a lot more old things in
[48:57] front of you then you have new things in
[49:00] front of you so you're less excited
[49:01] about life like that job they've been
[49:03] there 10 years and
[49:04] it's you that washing machine was now I
[49:08] got to buy another one it's
[49:10] broken you know the things that would
[49:13] excite you because they're all new
[49:15] you've been to that place 10
[49:17] times you know it doesn't excite you as
[49:19] much anymore that's
[49:22] the there's the excitement in life goes
[49:24] because there's not as much before you
[49:26] there's more behind you that there is
[49:27] before you even opportunities go you
[49:29] know things like that this is uh you
[49:31] know you have you have the same job you
[49:33] had the same job for a while it's not as
[49:35] exciting as what it was you it's the
[49:37] same people everywhere it's uh the same
[49:39] things every week the same challenges
[49:41] like oh this this one again same thing
[49:43] different day I'm not being all
[49:46] depressed but I'm just telling you
[49:47] that's how that's when when so um when
[49:50] they referring when I think Solomon
[49:52] referring to the evil days he's talking
[49:53] about this what happens in the human
[49:55] mind
[49:56] that how it unfolds and so you can if
[49:58] you don't watch it you can start to get
[49:59] dis dis excited about life if that's the
[50:01] right word disenchanted yeah now we're
[50:04] making up new words
[50:07] here that's why I never liked English
[50:09] because they don't let you make up new
[50:10] words you know like it's a subject you
[50:13] know if someone says a wrong word
[50:15] they're like no that's not a word it's
[50:16] like why not if I say it and someone
[50:18] else understands it we can it can be a
[50:21] word you know this ain't math 1 plus one
[50:24] is two this is this is where communic
[50:27] if we want to do that to communicate
[50:28] then we do that you know we communicate
[50:30] how we
[50:31] want disenchanted you become
[50:34] disenchanted with
[50:37] life I've always if you can liken it to
[50:40] the simple here a simple analogy I may
[50:42] have said this one before but I heard a
[50:44] brother talking about him and his wife
[50:46] would you know when they had a car like
[50:47] this we had an old car like this growing
[50:49] up too with the old bench seats along
[50:50] the front so you can sort of fit three
[50:52] or four on there Mom Dad and about four
[50:55] kids on the bench seat
[50:57] um but you know they're driving along
[50:59] one day and the he's driving and she's
[51:02] sitting over by the
[51:03] window and she says they American honey
[51:07] she says to him honey do you remember
[51:09] when uh remember we used to sit so close
[51:12] together honey you remember that oh and
[51:15] he's sitting there driving and he says I
[51:18] haven't
[51:23] moved but somewhere along the line the
[51:26] excitement of was sitting there slowly
[51:28] waned and she just slowly moved away and
[51:29] then now it's by the that side I haven't
[51:33] moved but excitement changed it caused
[51:38] it to go that way okay and you as you go
[51:42] through life you start to understand you
[51:43] you you look at it and you think this is
[51:46] sort of just doing the same thing week
[51:47] after week month after month year after
[51:49] year until it's all over it's just sort
[51:51] of going like this just going around
[51:54] like H this thing's just going round and
[51:56] round and
[51:57] around it's it's we're not really going
[51:59] anywhere it's just we're just living and
[52:02] then we die you know that and that's why
[52:05] um Solomon said the thing that has been
[52:06] is that which shall be he's like it's
[52:08] the same thing just a different time uh
[52:10] and that which is done is that which
[52:12] shall be done and there is no new thing
[52:14] under the sun because we get excited by
[52:16] new things you realize Not A lot's new
[52:18] you know you start to perceive this uh
[52:21] is there anything wherefore that may be
[52:23] said see this is
[52:24] new it has been already of old time
[52:27] which was before
[52:29] us this is not depressing this is just
[52:31] reality of how your brain starts to
[52:33] perceive as you and as you go the now
[52:35] we're talking the natural course of life
[52:37] now right we're not talking as a
[52:38] Christian this is why you get old
[52:40] depressed people because they most
[52:42] people naturally go this way now they
[52:44] fight with psychology to try and be
[52:46] happy and be excited about life and
[52:47] they're trying every trick in the book
[52:48] to remain excited about life but you
[52:50] know deep down they hate it you know you
[52:53] see that you see some people are just
[52:55] really hanging on to try and still be ex
[52:56] but they're not
[52:59] really but unfortunately you can get
[53:02] some Christians without the I don't know
[53:04] if they've got really got an unfilling
[53:05] with the Holy Ghost and the life of God
[53:06] and then because okay maybe I shouldn't
[53:08] say this but some people are a little
[53:09] bit like this you know they're kind of a
[53:12] depressed old a Christian life's just so
[53:14] hard and I'm just looking forward to it
[53:15] all being over so I can wait it out till
[53:17] the Rapture or death you
[53:22] know you know you've heard
[53:25] that they're not excited about
[53:27] nothing you know it's like what I'm
[53:30] going out the blaze of glory man don't
[53:32] know what you're
[53:33] doing usually this way of thinking is
[53:36] because I think if you don't have the
[53:38] Holy Ghost and that real life in you
[53:39] you've you've naturally taken the course
[53:42] of the natural way you're just mentally
[53:45] trying to think up some good things
[53:47] about it you know and you end up with
[53:49] this sort of attitude of uh you know I
[53:51] can't wait for the SW to be over because
[53:52] it's just you know it's you're actually
[53:55] you're just sort of patched
[53:58] up but even I I think this is correct to
[54:02] a degree even brother brandom did suffer
[54:03] from the slightly when he began to lose
[54:06] his love for the people because he
[54:07] realized this is just the same thing
[54:08] over and over again I try to help that
[54:10] person they just they don't listen that
[54:12] one goes this one and then yeah they're
[54:13] here that week and gone and they you
[54:15] know it it it became a bit I think I
[54:17] think when he first started it would
[54:18] have been like so much hope and long
[54:20] suffering not that he ever went really
[54:22] bad but you know it was just
[54:24] the when you continually see it maybe go
[54:26] the other way with it he he did begin to
[54:28] get a bit more like here we go again you
[54:31] know and he actually himself admitted
[54:33] I've kind of lost my love for the people
[54:34] or not lost I'm losing it so you had to
[54:37] re jig how he thought to make sure I
[54:39] don't want to go down that path you know
[54:41] I want to be excited when someone says
[54:43] they want to receive the Lord I want to
[54:44] move forward even if it's the H
[54:45] hundredth time they've done it and it's
[54:47] the same person I want to be excited Yep
[54:48] this could be the time the1st time could
[54:50] be the time praise God you know why not
[54:54] you know I'm I'm still excited about
[54:55] this you know we don't want to lose that
[54:57] that
[54:58] way but just to cap off this thought
[55:00] then we'll swing back around another way
[55:02] Winston Churchill you know Winston
[55:03] Churchill was the Prime Minister of
[55:05] England and he he he would he had an
[55:07] exciting life you could say very
[55:09] exciting and and he he led the Allies
[55:12] through um World War II Britain and that
[55:14] and it was a you know there were you
[55:16] think of his day at any given day
[55:19] amongst these especially these three or
[55:20] four five years of World War II was he
[55:22] was a busy man a lot of stuff going on
[55:24] every single day and even the buildup to
[55:25] it and his his everything and he lived
[55:29] what you would term a very exciting life
[55:30] I don't think there was one day to the
[55:32] next there was the same you know very
[55:34] exciting and he he wrote that
[55:36] um speech it said we shall not flag or
[55:40] fail we shall go on to the end we shall
[55:43] fight in France we shall fight on the
[55:44] Seas and oceans we shall fight with
[55:46] growing confidence and growing strength
[55:48] in the air we shall defend our Island
[55:50] whatever the cost may be we shall fight
[55:51] on the beaches we shall fight on the
[55:53] landing grounds we shall fight in the
[55:56] fields and in the streets we shall fight
[55:57] in the Hills we shall Never
[56:00] Surrender this guy was an exciting guy
[56:02] you know you hang around this guy it's
[56:03] probably an exciting life but you know
[56:04] what his last words were before he
[56:07] died these were his last words I'm bored
[56:10] with it
[56:12] all famous last
[56:14] words in a sense he's right he sort of
[56:17] he' done all the international politics
[56:18] and everything it's like even at that
[56:20] level it's all the same this one's upset
[56:22] with that one he's upset it's just like
[56:24] being in a schoolyard little tussles
[56:25] except this country she was tussling
[56:26] with that one and they want this and
[56:27] I'll give me that toy back and know he
[56:29] came and took this you know it's just
[56:30] like oh man I'm bored with it all
[56:32] honestly you
[56:35] know now but for a
[56:38] Christian for a Christian now is it an
[56:41] ex is it uh do we as we progress in life
[56:45] do we go to an evil day or do we go to
[56:46] an exciting
[56:48] day I choose an exciting day I choose to
[56:52] be excited by the things of the
[56:54] Lord I ch choose that actually I'm not
[56:57] going that same way I I choose that I
[57:00] choose that that when I receive Christ I
[57:03] receive a life in me that
[57:05] grows this thing's growing so even if my
[57:09] natural life and everything seems to be
[57:10] going the other way there's something
[57:11] else some me that's just growing every
[57:13] year it's growing it's changing it's Mak
[57:14] it's new it's there new things happening
[57:16] it's exciting I'm excited by life
[57:19] because there's there's a there's a life
[57:21] of me that's growing and in 5 years time
[57:23] even if I look like I'm a whole lot
[57:24] older a whole lot more worn out I'm
[57:25] going to be more excited because there's
[57:26] something growing more and more in me
[57:28] every single day week month there's a
[57:31] life in me and
[57:33] and and that's why Jesus said I am come
[57:35] that they might have life and that they
[57:37] might have it more
[57:38] abundantly more abundantly as the days
[57:40] go on it's more abundant every day so so
[57:42] the older you get the more abundant your
[57:44] life becomes because you have it more
[57:45] abundantly the the the bigger this life
[57:48] when you becomes as you grow this life
[57:49] becomes bigger and bigger so it's like
[57:50] man this is so exciting what's it going
[57:52] to be next year you know it's so
[57:54] exciting it's that's why I say the other
[57:56] person that's all down about life trying
[57:57] to be a Christian it's like maybe you
[57:58] haven't got that life in you that
[58:00] actually makes you new and and and the
[58:03] scripture that says it is of the Lord's
[58:04] mercies that we are not consumed because
[58:06] his compassions fail not they are new
[58:08] Every Morning his mercies are new every
[58:11] morning every morning I wake up there's
[58:12] something new from the lord it's
[58:14] exciting Lord what is it today what what
[58:15] new Mercy have you got for me today what
[58:17] what new compassion what new word what
[58:20] what new thing have you got for me today
[58:21] it's exciting it's not we're not bored
[58:24] we're excited we're we're we're happy to
[58:26] be alive it says but they that wait upon
[58:28] the Lord shall renew their strength the
[58:31] old we get we seem to get weaker and
[58:33] weaker but it's like my strengths is
[58:34] renewed as I wait upon the Lord I get
[58:36] renewed day by day they shall run and
[58:38] not be R they shall walk and not faint
[58:41] we we have we have this life in us and
[58:43] we have these promises and we have this
[58:44] eternal God that never gets bored and
[58:46] never gets UND
[58:49] disenchanted never gets disenchanted
[58:51] he's he's always there's always energy
[58:53] and excitement and power and things
[58:55] flowing out from him we happened that
[58:56] it's just always coming our way it's
[58:57] always making us excited even when we're
[58:59] old we're excited about life we're
[59:01] excited to be alive we're happy to be
[59:02] alive we wake up happy and joyful
[59:04] because the life of God is in
[59:07] us I was wondering one time I thought
[59:09] why do I like fly fishing so much what
[59:10] is it about fly fishing that I enjoy you
[59:12] know it's kind of catching the fish I
[59:14] guess but when I thought deeper into it
[59:17] I thought you know the exciting thing
[59:18] for me about fly fishing especially on a
[59:20] river I don't do Lake because it's very
[59:22] boring because you can see where you're
[59:23] going but on a river
[59:26] the rivers take twists and turns and if
[59:28] it's especially if it's a New River even
[59:29] if it's an old River it doesn't it's
[59:30] still the same but newer ones are
[59:31] slightly better than old ones but you
[59:33] just never know what's around the corner
[59:35] you're like if there's nothing in this
[59:37] pool it's all right just around there
[59:39] there might be a better pool and a
[59:40] better fish in there and you're like oh
[59:43] I'll go there and before you know you've
[59:45] burnt like 2third of the day walking up
[59:47] and you're like oh man I got to walk all
[59:49] the way back down and it's going to be
[59:51] but you you forget about it because
[59:52] you're so
[59:53] excited okay there's something around
[59:55] the next corner you get there you f it
[59:57] oh this I just want to go up where I can
[59:59] see up there there's something there
[1:00:00] it's the excitement of actually weaving
[1:00:02] up but you know we as Christians you
[1:00:06] know when you labor for the kingdom of
[1:00:07] God there should be the same excitement
[1:00:08] about about finding a lost sheep to to
[1:00:11] searching it out you think maybe just
[1:00:13] maybe maybe this week I'll find them
[1:00:14] maybe maybe something's going to happen
[1:00:16] here it's it should be exciting it
[1:00:18] excites us is what's going to happen on
[1:00:21] on this journey of Life what will I come
[1:00:23] across as I Journey who who will I meet
[1:00:24] who will I talk to How Will I unfold you
[1:00:26] know it's
[1:00:27] exciting uh and you realize the Angels
[1:00:30] get excited when one of those lost sheep
[1:00:33] gets found they get really excited these
[1:00:36] these these angels it says likewise I
[1:00:38] say there is joy in heaven and the
[1:00:40] presence of the angels of God over one
[1:00:42] sinner that repenteth they get excited
[1:00:43] man they they're they're watching this
[1:00:46] thing unfold and they think oh will this
[1:00:48] person repent they
[1:00:49] did they they're so
[1:00:52] excited there's a story of the um the
[1:00:56] this is this is the armor and Company
[1:00:57] it's actually called the armor and
[1:00:58] Company it was a big um it was actually
[1:01:00] a big meat Works company and then they
[1:01:02] would buy ranches and then all the meat
[1:01:04] would go from the ranches back to there
[1:01:06] be Pro processed this was the company
[1:01:07] that brother B talked about in Chicago
[1:01:10] very big company and they were having
[1:01:12] the you know they they were having that
[1:01:14] bit of a shindig down in some Ranch in
[1:01:16] Texas or wherever it was these guys were
[1:01:17] from Chicago and the boss of sun was
[1:01:19] going to be there and and all the girls
[1:01:20] there were trying to get this this um
[1:01:23] the boss's son you know to maybe go and
[1:01:24] have a b life but brother brandham tells
[1:01:27] the story and he he tells the story of
[1:01:28] the washwoman you know and that and
[1:01:30] eventually the the boss of son went and
[1:01:32] saw the washwoman and said you know it's
[1:01:33] I've been looking at all the girls and
[1:01:35] you know you you I've seen all their
[1:01:37] type cuz I see them in Chicago and
[1:01:38] everywhere but I I see a character in
[1:01:39] you that I just really like and I admire
[1:01:41] you know and and I you're the sort of
[1:01:43] girl I'm looking for you know and he
[1:01:45] said I'd like you to come back with me
[1:01:47] and I'll take you out of this little
[1:01:49] place where you're in these washing
[1:01:50] these dishes and I'll take you back to
[1:01:51] Chicago I got Mansions up there well

[1:02:07] the time went on she's more excited
[1:02:08] every day as it went on 1 2 3 4 5 and as
[1:02:11] the days counted down she's more excited
[1:02:13] you know and and and it should be the
[1:02:15] same with us we're actually invited to

[1:02:20] this place to be with the lord it's like
[1:02:22] okay if it didn't happen today that
[1:02:23] means technically it's one day closer
[1:02:26] like it's exciting I'm excited we're
[1:02:29] excited I've got I've got something to

[1:02:37] dishes weren't so hard the next day just

[1:02:42] became easier she was a model employee
[1:02:44] after that like even more than what she
[1:02:45] was before cuz she was excited that
[1:02:47] someone had given her a promise to come
[1:02:49] back and get her and take her out of
[1:02:50] there it was exciting suddenly her life
[1:02:52] was exciting and and uh what else
[1:02:55] excites us is say the revelation of the
[1:02:56] word excites us when we get Revelation
[1:02:59] and this is Brother adan's word the
[1:03:01] stimulation of
[1:03:04] Revelation s you know it it the the word
[1:03:07] comes in and it it strikes the seed in
[1:03:09] us like and we get excited that it's
[1:03:12] Revelation excites us you know so so we
[1:03:14] can we can live in a total mundane
[1:03:17] looking sort of life and be so excited
[1:03:18] in our hearts because the the the the
[1:03:20] revealed word is continuing to excite us
[1:03:22] it comes in and we're excited we're like
[1:03:23] this is so exciting what are you excited

[1:03:30] excited in your heart you know we we it
[1:03:33] doesn't matter then circumstances don't
[1:03:35] matter anymore because there's an
[1:03:36] excitement that we get that's deeper
[1:03:38] than all that you
[1:03:39] know the eagle when the eagle was in the
[1:03:41] chicken Coupe and it heard the Eagles
[1:03:45] cry you can't tell me it didn't get
[1:03:47] excited what's that what am I hearing
[1:03:51] ctis all shot up and it was a good
[1:03:52] feeling I thought I like that and then
[1:03:54] ctis all shot up I thought this is
[1:03:55] exciting what is that this is something
[1:03:57] new I recognize this you know that the
[1:04:01] word excites the gene seed of God that's
[1:04:03] in US it pure word of God it just
[1:04:04] excites us when we hear it and when we
[1:04:06] go to fellowship and we're in the spirit
[1:04:07] of God and we get a and then the Lord
[1:04:09] just reveals something else to us it
[1:04:10] excites us that we leave church excited
[1:04:11] we're so excited we leave listening to a
[1:04:13] tape
[1:04:15] excited uh and and when things happen
[1:04:17] when the Lord does things in our life we
[1:04:19] get excited it's like the woman at the
[1:04:20] well she after she had she had that
[1:04:23] experience with the Lord she got so
[1:04:24] excited ran down to the Village come
[1:04:25] look who I found you know they're like
[1:04:27] What's gotten over here the Lord did the
[1:04:31] the the spirit of God got over her and
[1:04:32] it excited her about things suddenly
[1:04:34] they like man haven't seen her like that
[1:04:35] before she's excited seeing God fulfill
[1:04:39] his word excites us that's why we have
[1:04:41] testimonies you know someone we we're
[1:04:43] hearing a testimony and we're waiting to
[1:04:44] see what's going to happen what's going
[1:04:45] to happen we know what's going to happen
[1:04:47] we know it's going to turn out all right
[1:04:48] but we're just we're so excited what's
[1:04:49] going to happen what are they going to
[1:04:50] say are they going to get healed are
[1:04:53] they and they do yes I knew they would
[1:04:56] praise the Lord we're excited you know
[1:04:58] we we see the Lord move and work we get
[1:05:00] excited it excites us there's there's um
[1:05:03] and even anticipation excites us when we
[1:05:05] going through something we think now
[1:05:06] it's all going to be all right don't
[1:05:07] worry the Lord's going to do something
[1:05:09] and I'm excited to see what it is if you
[1:05:11] don't think like that you should I'm
[1:05:12] excited to see what he's going to do oh
[1:05:14] you're at Rock Bottom there's only one
[1:05:16] place from here then that's
[1:05:18] up it should be it's exciting it's not
[1:05:21] like if you don't believe it's like oh
[1:05:22] well down at the bottom I'll probably
[1:05:24] just go even and lie you know someone
[1:05:24] will dig a hole and fall in that you
[1:05:27] know but Faith excites us because it it
[1:05:31] we we have faith in this word of God and
[1:05:33] we think this is exciting like Caleb you
[1:05:34] know he said hey I'm I'm twice the age
[1:05:36] of what I was back then but I'm still
[1:05:38] excited we can still take the land that
[1:05:39] still excites me um I've got as much
[1:05:41] Faith as I had did back then because
[1:05:43] it's the same faith and then it's just
[1:05:44] it's still going his body looked a whole
[1:05:46] lot older but he was still excited he
[1:05:48] was excited to go and he was excited
[1:05:49] when he was 40 and he was excited when
[1:05:51] he was
[1:05:52] 80 uh laboring in the body of Christ
[1:05:55] excites us we we see growth it's
[1:05:57] exciting we we see people grow on the
[1:05:59] law we see Souls come in things happen
[1:06:01] and different things and excites us it's
[1:06:03] an exciting and it excites us because in
[1:06:05] our mind we know it's for an eternal
[1:06:07] purpose so it's not just this going
[1:06:09] around this wheel like I like I film a
[1:06:11] lot of basketball and things like that
[1:06:12] know year after year after year we film
[1:06:14] these basketball tournaments and things
[1:06:15] and then you realize after about the
[1:06:17] fifth year you're like this tournament
[1:06:19] is just a new crop coming in go on it
[1:06:21] and chucked out and they win this Trophy
[1:06:22] and then the six we and they grab it and
[1:06:24] then that stays and they and they grab
[1:06:26] the trophy you know and you think this
[1:06:28] is all standing still like what's this
[1:06:31] all for they get it they then they put
[1:06:34] it back there another person tries to
[1:06:35] get it it's just a it's like this is a
[1:06:37] complete waste of time this is pointless
[1:06:41] just what are we doing here for
[1:06:43] Te what are we here
[1:06:45] for but the the the value that you get
[1:06:47] out of achieving it doesn't last you
[1:06:50] know but but but when you understand
[1:06:51] Eternal things and eternal value then
[1:06:53] then as a Christian you're excited when
[1:06:55] you see Eternal things happening you see
[1:06:56] a soul life change and grow you think
[1:06:59] this is I can rejoice in this you get a
[1:07:00] shot of cortisol in your head you're
[1:07:01] excited like cuz this is good this is
[1:07:04] eternal that that that person was lost
[1:07:06] now they found this person had that they
[1:07:07] were struggling with that now they're
[1:07:08] free from it and they're I can see
[1:07:09] they're happy you know there's things
[1:07:10] happening in their
[1:07:11] life that's why you know when you see
[1:07:13] growth in the body of Christ it excites
[1:07:15] you it's
[1:07:17] exciting or and and then seeing God work
[1:07:20] in your own life excites you it's
[1:07:21] exciting you're like because you're
[1:07:23] you're your favorite subject
[1:07:26] put your hand up if you're
[1:07:30] not brother man you need to talk to your
[1:07:32] wife about speaking the truth now
[1:07:34] Jing If we're honest we are our favorite
[1:07:37] subject you know and we should be no one
[1:07:39] else is really going to look out for us
[1:07:41] ultimately like I love a little I love
[1:07:43] that maybe I shouldn't say this I love
[1:07:45] that about little kids you know they're
[1:07:46] all me me me and I'm and like oh just
[1:07:48] settle down a little Johnny but like now
[1:07:49] hang on if Little Johnny doesn't say me
[1:07:51] who's going to Little Johnny's got to
[1:07:53] say me Little Johnny thinks he's
[1:07:55] important if he doesn't say me he gets
[1:07:57] no Lolly so let little Johnny say me you
[1:07:59] know yeah sure you learn to go online
[1:08:01] and all that sort of stuff but that's
[1:08:02] good because what if God didn't make us
[1:08:05] like that you know we'd go and you know
[1:08:08] get no food and die in the corner you
[1:08:10] know it's good I like that uh and even
[1:08:13] about your job you know you I don't know
[1:08:15] why I put this one in there but you can
[1:08:16] start to see the Lord work and you maybe
[1:08:19] in your career and you you just see them
[1:08:20] work there you think Lord I'm happy
[1:08:21] about this job and they just I don't
[1:08:23] know maybe a same job is at two
[1:08:25] different things to a Christian it's
[1:08:26] something amazing to someone else your
[1:08:28] work man it's like this job but it could
[1:08:30] be two different things for a Christian
[1:08:31] because you think the Lord's put me here
[1:08:32] for a purpose I I really feel I'm in the
[1:08:34] right place I'm liking doing this uh you
[1:08:37] know you you you have family and you can
[1:08:39] see the Lord work in your family and
[1:08:40] there maybe ups and downs but you know
[1:08:41] you you just it's exciting to just watch
[1:08:43] it all unfold and hold it stand on to
[1:08:44] the promises of God and um this one here
[1:08:48] is very exciting when you work in your
[1:08:50] calling when you start to realize this
[1:08:52] is what my calling is this is my these
[1:08:53] are my talents and you start to use them
[1:08:55] it's exciting you get excited you're
[1:08:58] like I'm so happy I can I'm so happy I I
[1:09:00] know what I'm supposed to be doing for
[1:09:01] the Lord I know how many talents I've
[1:09:02] got and I can be doing them for the Lord
[1:09:03] I'm so excited this is good fun I can
[1:09:05] wake up every morning and I'm excited
[1:09:07] because I get to I get to live for the
[1:09:08] Lord I get to to live out my purpose I'm
[1:09:11] not just here on this wheel going you
[1:09:13] know trophy next one trophy next one I
[1:09:16] get to I'm excited because I'm I'm
[1:09:18] laboring for the Lord I'm I'm doing my
[1:09:19] calling and if you don't know what your
[1:09:21] calling is or what your talents are you
[1:09:23] should really diligently try and figure
[1:09:24] what out what that is because that's a
[1:09:26] very important part of being a
[1:09:29] Christian once you get saved you need to
[1:09:31] know why am I here and what are my
[1:09:33] talents and then you need to start doing
[1:09:35] them because if you don't you'll
[1:09:36] probably just go I didn't go this one
[1:09:38] you'll probably just go this
[1:09:39] direction you'll just fill up your life
[1:09:41] with other stuff and it'll be a very
[1:09:43] boring life be very
[1:09:45] unfulfilling but when you you
[1:09:48] know I've just got a few more than I'm
[1:09:51] done here this is this is Paul and this
[1:09:53] is a timeline of Paul's life now Paul
[1:09:56] actually started his ministry at about
[1:09:59] the time when the evil day
[1:10:01] begins
[1:10:03] roughly he he got he was converted they
[1:10:05] say about 30 he was converted so so
[1:10:09] theoretically as a natural man life for
[1:10:11] him should have been sort of slowly
[1:10:12] going downhill from there but that's
[1:10:13] when his ministry started and he just
[1:10:15] started going up from there and and and
[1:10:17] when you think when you put yourself in
[1:10:19] Paul's shoes you realize so Paul he he
[1:10:21] was for about three years he was um
[1:10:26] he sort of just went and sought the Lord
[1:10:27] and then he then he went to Jerusalem
[1:10:29] then I think his first missionary
[1:10:31] journey was was it
[1:10:33] 60 55 I
[1:10:36] think and so this this guy was pushing
[1:10:40] 50 that's not not a young man and he's
[1:10:44] going out being Shipwrecked stoned
[1:10:47] beaten starving this a 50-year old
[1:10:51] man and then throw him in prison and and
[1:10:55] then this man is almost pushing 60 when
[1:10:58] he when he was going over to from ceria
[1:11:02] to Rome to be in prison and when he got
[1:11:04] Shipwrecked and then they he went onto
[1:11:07] the aisle of
[1:11:08] um
[1:11:10] uh the Greek people it's out in the
[1:11:13] middle of the
[1:11:15] Mediterranean uh no it's a Malta Malta
[1:11:19] yeah but I think they name is something
[1:11:20] else yeah I could be wrong but I think
[1:11:23] it I it's molter I think because it's in
[1:11:25] the middle in the shipping Lane so this
[1:11:28] man's this man's pushing
[1:11:30] 60 and he's he's out traveling the
[1:11:33] world roughing it on a ship and all that
[1:11:36] you'd think he should be tired and
[1:11:38] exhausted but he's going for it at 60
[1:11:41] he's going for it and we complain you
[1:11:43] know we get to 30 we're like I'm getting
[1:11:44] too old for this too old for that to for
[1:11:46] the other thing this man wasn't getting
[1:11:48] too old for nothing he was going for it
[1:11:51] because he had a strengthen them that
[1:11:52] was renewed day by day and he was and
[1:11:54] then and then he's thrown in jail at 60
[1:11:57] and
[1:11:58] and and he said to this is and then
[1:12:01] that's when he wrote second Timothy
[1:12:02] which is one of the last books he wrote
[1:12:03] he wrote second Timothy and he wrote to
[1:12:04] Timothy he said for I am now ready to be
[1:12:06] offered and the time of my departure is
[1:12:08] at hand I have fought a good fight I
[1:12:10] have finished my course I've kept the
[1:12:11] faith I've lived an exciting life I'm
[1:12:15] excited and I'm excited where it's going
[1:12:16] to go from here on you
[1:12:19] know so then I say to you then that
[1:12:22] waking up in the morning excites you
[1:12:24] tomorrow morning and wake up so excited
[1:12:27] I'm so excited to be alive man look at
[1:12:29] look at what lays before me today so
[1:12:31] much
[1:12:32] opportunity this may sound a little bit
[1:12:34] morbid but I had a when I was studying
[1:12:35] doing film I had the my film teacher um
[1:12:39] he was really good but he was a bit sort
[1:12:40] of he was kind of a morbid sort of guy
[1:12:42] like we would study his films he made
[1:12:44] because it was he couldn't really get
[1:12:46] rights to other films so for the film
[1:12:47] course we would study his ones and they
[1:12:48] were always like these weird horror ones
[1:12:50] and stuff like that you know he was a
[1:12:51] bit weird and always had this demonic
[1:12:53] symbolism in them and stuff
[1:12:55] was and um later on four three or four
[1:13:00] years after I finished the course he got
[1:13:02] I guess it was a bad cancer and
[1:13:04] that and um and he started essentially
[1:13:07] Facebooking blogging his he was a Aid
[1:13:10] Facebook user anyway but he started sort
[1:13:12] of blogging his journey of I suppose
[1:13:14] you'd say death you know well it was but
[1:13:18] he would always talk about what he was
[1:13:20] up to anyway so this was not nothing new
[1:13:21] for him he was just explaining what was
[1:13:22] happening so so one of them was um so
[1:13:25] then he began to say as he got older uh
[1:13:27] weaker and weaker he could hardly walk
[1:13:28] anymore and that he he would put out a a
[1:13:31] a Facebook post in the morning and say I
[1:13:33] woke up again I woke up this morning and
[1:13:35] I was alive again Pamela thinks it's
[1:13:38] rather lovely the way I open my eyes and
[1:13:40] say I'm
[1:13:42] alive don't know how long this can keep
[1:13:44] up for it seems to be working for
[1:13:46] now but I found that so interesting when
[1:13:48] I read it this man wakes up he says whoa
[1:13:51] I'm
[1:13:52] alive I'm alive and when was last you
[1:13:55] did that you know I'm alive like he was
[1:13:57] surprised to be alive another day then
[1:14:01] so he posted that one day then the next
[1:14:03] day I thought wonder if this man's still
[1:14:04] alive so I checked his Facebook post the
[1:14:06] next day I'm still
[1:14:11] here here I am I'm
[1:14:14] alive next post you know Phil Davison
[1:14:17] passed away this time he's
[1:14:20] gone but I like that I kind of thought
[1:14:23] you know I want to be like that man I'm
[1:14:25] alive wow I've got another opportunity
[1:14:28] to
[1:14:29] live because there's a scripture that
[1:14:31] says whatsoever the hand find this to do
[1:14:33] do it with thy might for there is no
[1:14:35] work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom
[1:14:38] in the grave whether thou goest once
[1:14:40] your time's up your time's up it's done
[1:14:43] there's nothing else it's over so why
[1:14:46] not make the most of it here do all that
[1:14:48] you can do be excited about the things
[1:14:50] of the Lord don't don't be scared be
[1:14:53] excited this I just going to finish with
[1:14:55] one of these this one story here this
[1:14:58] lady Helen Keller don't know if you've
[1:15:01] read much about her
[1:15:03] but um when she was I think 19 months
[1:15:07] she got some got an illness that made
[1:15:08] her blind and deaf so so this woman
[1:15:12] couldn't see or couldn't hear she could
[1:15:14] communicate slightly because she did
[1:15:15] learn to talk in those first few in the
[1:15:18] first few years slightly
[1:15:22] but um there was a lady
[1:15:26] her parents wanted to try and teach this
[1:15:28] girl somehow to communicate with the
[1:15:30] world because before that she would just
[1:15:32] kind of she could hear footsteps and she
[1:15:34] could maybe do about 60 hand signals to
[1:15:37] say maybe come or go or whatever it
[1:15:40] might be just quite rudimentary one so
[1:15:42] she couldn't communicate with the world
[1:15:44] or connect in any way and they there was
[1:15:48] a lady an Sullivan that her parents
[1:15:50] brought in to try and help this girl to
[1:15:54] help her in some way to connect with the
[1:15:56] world to communicate because they knew
[1:15:57] she was very intelligent she wasn't dumb
[1:15:59] she just couldn't communicate and it was
[1:16:01] funny because Helen K said that the day
[1:16:04] that Anne Sullivan arrived she calls
[1:16:06] that the birthday of her
[1:16:08] soul because of the impact that this
[1:16:10] woman had on her now what this woman
[1:16:13] tried to do to get through to Helen was
[1:16:17] she tried writing on her hand um words
[1:16:22] so letters which form a words so so
[1:16:25] Helen had a doll so she would write she
[1:16:28] would try and point to the doll and
[1:16:29] write d o o l d o l l on her
[1:16:34] hand um and but Helen didn't know why
[1:16:38] she was doing it and she would actually
[1:16:39] learn to copy the words and write it
[1:16:40] back on her hand just by feel because
[1:16:42] she would feel what she did so she'd do
[1:16:43] it back but she didn't know that it was
[1:16:45] to do with the doll like she would touch
[1:16:47] the doll and do that and she tried to do
[1:16:49] it with a a mug you know and write m u
[1:16:52] and have hold the mug but Helen got so
[1:16:54] frustrated she just took the mug and
[1:16:55] threw it away cuz she's like what on
[1:16:57] Earth is are you trying to do cuz she
[1:16:58] couldn't
[1:16:59] connect you're trying to tell me what
[1:17:02] words are cuz she didn't know what words
[1:17:03] were imagine that she didn't understand
[1:17:05] this concept what are these things like
[1:17:07] I don't know what a word is I don't know
[1:17:09] what a letter is now this this lady is a
[1:17:12] Christian lady Helen I don't know maybe
[1:17:14] it was after that she got converted but
[1:17:15] she so uh so she couldn't she didn't
[1:17:20] know why this person an was trying to do
[1:17:23] this with her and all she got was
[1:17:24] frustrated was maybe weeks she just got
[1:17:26] frustrated until one day they were
[1:17:29] walking outside and there was a little
[1:17:31] there was this Fountain here and I think
[1:17:34] an had an idea and so she put her hand
[1:17:37] under the fountain with the water
[1:17:38] flowing on her hand and she wrote in the
[1:17:40] other hand water w a t e r so she had
[1:17:44] the sensation on her hand and she wrote
[1:17:46] water and Helen said something went off
[1:17:48] in her mind and she thought maybe that
[1:17:51] is connected to
[1:17:52] that what is that what is this write it
[1:17:56] again and she would spell it back and
[1:18:00] something clicked and she thought that's
[1:18:02] a way to communicate she's trying to
[1:18:04] reach me and she just latched on to it
[1:18:07] like wouldn't believe and I think it she
[1:18:08] was learning 30 new words a day just
[1:18:11] word word word word word she just this
[1:18:14] lady ended up writing like 16 books and
[1:18:16] all sorts of stuff just
[1:18:18] like not from she went from not even
[1:18:20] knowing what words were to like just
[1:18:23] words were everything to her because she
[1:18:24] couldn't see she couldn't hear but I
[1:18:27] think it was just the mercy of the Lord
[1:18:28] that she could then do this
[1:18:30] but she's got a quite a neat
[1:18:35] quote and it says security is mostly a
[1:18:38] Superstition it does not exist in nature
[1:18:41] nor do the children of men as a whole
[1:18:43] experience it avoiding danger is no
[1:18:46] longer is no safer in the long run than
[1:18:49] outright exposure life is either a
[1:18:51] daring Adventure or nothing
[1:18:56] so take that from a blind deaf
[1:18:59] woman life is either a daring Adventure
[1:19:01] or nothing be excited about it don't be
[1:19:05] don't let this cortisol thing make you
[1:19:07] anxious make it be excited don't let an
[1:19:10] enemy think I know he's going to get me
[1:19:11] think I'm excited because the Lord's
[1:19:13] going to defeat that
[1:19:15] enemy I want to finish with one pem and
[1:19:18] I I just always like this pem because it
[1:19:19] sort of encapsulates how we should be
[1:19:21] towards life and that you know the
[1:19:22] excitement that we should have and this
[1:19:23] was brother R quoted this poem a lot
[1:19:25] from this old man Henry
[1:19:27] Longfellow and it
[1:19:29] says Tell Me Not in mournful numbers
[1:19:32] life is but an empty dream for the soul
[1:19:34] is dead that Slumbers and things are not
[1:19:36] what they seem life is real life is
[1:19:37] earnest and the grave is not our goal
[1:19:40] thus Thou Art to dust return us was not
[1:19:42] spoken of the Soul not enjoyment and not
[1:19:45] sorrow is our destined end or way but to
[1:19:48] act that each tomorrow finds us further
[1:19:49] than today art is long and time is
[1:19:52] fleeting and our heart so Stout and
[1:19:53] brave still like muffled drums are
[1:19:56] beating funeral marches to the grave in
[1:19:58] this world's field of battle in the
[1:20:01] bwack of Life be not like dumb driven
[1:20:04] cattle be a hero in The Strife trust no
[1:20:06] future however pleasant Let the
[1:20:10] dead Let the dead pass bury the dead act
[1:20:14] act and the living present heart within
[1:20:16] and God overhead lives of Great Men all
[1:20:18] remind us we can make our lives Sublime
[1:20:20] and departing leave behind us footprints
[1:20:22] in the sands of time footprints that
[1:20:24] perhaps another sailing over life solemn
[1:20:26] man a fallong and shipwreck brother
[1:20:28] seeing shall take hope again let us then
[1:20:31] be up and doing with the heart for any
[1:20:32] fate still achieving still pursuing
[1:20:34] learn to labor and to
[1:20:36] wait I think that's a nice sermon I can
[1:20:38] see why brother bam liked it because it
[1:20:39] talked about be excited about life be
[1:20:42] move forward in the Lord be excited have
[1:20:44] faith because this this way of doing
[1:20:46] things in life means you have faith you

[1:20:50] faith I believe this I'm excited to move

[1:36:02] and you thankful for that amen praise
[1:36:04] the Lord you want to take your seats uh
[1:36:06] Hannah's got a testimony from Camp you
[1:36:08] like this year amen praise the
[1:36:10] Lord thank
[1:36:12] you hello
[1:36:15] everyone I'm not used to seeing you all
[1:36:18] here in front of me so it's good to see
[1:36:20] you guys after a week um my testimony is
[1:36:24] a a bit of a longer one so I hope I
[1:36:27] don't take too long sharing it but it
[1:36:29] started back at the Aly Camp I felt like
[1:36:32] it was a
[1:36:33] very very slow camp for me compared to
[1:36:35] what happened the year before so I
[1:36:37] thought what am I doing here you know
[1:36:38] I've already got my salvation who
[1:36:40] doesn't Tamer so I start praying for
[1:36:43] tamer in the services I start praying I
[1:36:45] said Lord I've got my salvation but I've
[1:36:47] got a
[1:36:48] friend a friend in a
[1:36:51] dorm and she's not SA
[1:36:56] Lord so I pray and I pray and for me
[1:37:00] personally I don't think it's very I'm
[1:37:01] not really outgoing when it comes to
[1:37:02] things like telling people to come
[1:37:04] places or saying come to church with me
[1:37:05] I'm not I don't really do that I sort of
[1:37:07] just let people be influenced by my life
[1:37:09] and decide if they want to do it
[1:37:11] themselves but for some reason when Tam
[1:37:13] was there and we were sitting there we
[1:37:15] were talking about how fun it was that
[1:37:16] we were at camp together and she was you
[1:37:17] know we're in the dining hall having a
[1:37:19] little snack and she was like it's so
[1:37:20] much fun here Hannah and I said yeah you
[1:37:22] know there's a Youth Camp She said said
[1:37:24] I said you should come she said are you
[1:37:26] paying I said I can she said I'll just
[1:37:30] come then why not so T came to Youth
[1:37:33] Camp She which is a miracle in itself
[1:37:37] but I thought wow that's that's quite
[1:37:39] strange you know why why did she come to
[1:37:41] Camp so in the weeks leading up to Camp
[1:37:44] I was praying a lot and that's
[1:37:47] unfortunately a bit unusual for me to
[1:37:49] pray so much about something until I get
[1:37:50] an answer but then on the Sunday before
[1:37:53] I think it was the the Sunday that we
[1:37:56] left to go camping brother Ben was
[1:37:58] standing up here talking about how he
[1:38:00] was wanted to go to Pap and new getting
[1:38:01] a minister but he didn't know the
[1:38:02] language and God told him just go and
[1:38:04] I'll do the rest so I took that for
[1:38:06] myself and I said look I'm not going to
[1:38:08] say anything I'm not going to push
[1:38:09] anything I'm just going to go I'm just
[1:38:11] going to bring her with me and see what
[1:38:12] happens so I
[1:38:15] went I went to Camp with t and t doesn't
[1:38:20] really like doing things if she doesn't
[1:38:21] really want to do them so she didn't go
[1:38:22] to any of the service
[1:38:24] but she was there for the small things
[1:38:25] like the testimonies she was there for
[1:38:27] the the prayers before the meals because
[1:38:31] she likes the meals and then there was
[1:38:34] one point when I'd been I've been going
[1:38:37] through so much during this Camp I would
[1:38:39] say it's the most awful Camp I've ever
[1:38:40] been through not because of the people
[1:38:42] not because of the place but just
[1:38:43] because in my mind everything was going
[1:38:45] hay I just all my insecurities all my
[1:38:47] flaws everything that I could think
[1:38:49] about about myself was just being thrown
[1:38:51] at me and I was like why am I here what
[1:38:53] am I I doing here and then I think it
[1:38:55] was after just days and days of this
[1:38:58] just being attacked I got to the last
[1:39:01] service and it was halfway through and
[1:39:03] I'm staring up at this preacher I'm like
[1:39:05] I don't like you and I don't know why
[1:39:07] this whole thing's a share I'm like what
[1:39:09] am I doing here and then I think you
[1:39:11] know if I can't be here present for
[1:39:13] myself I might as well be here for Tam
[1:39:16] so I'm sitting there and I'm watching
[1:39:17] the preacher I'm staring at him I'm
[1:39:18] saying if you're going to preach brother
[1:39:20] you better to preach cuz I'm here to
[1:39:21] listen to you and you better to preach
[1:39:22] something for me right now and he
[1:39:25] doesn't but it's all right cuz I was
[1:39:27] present then and I was thinking you know
[1:39:29] if I can't be here for me I've got to be
[1:39:31] here for Tam so there was a prayer line
[1:39:32] and I was waiting and I thought no I'm
[1:39:34] just going to sing for a little bit I'm
[1:39:35] not going to go up and I'm waiting and
[1:39:37] waiting and all of a sudden a song comes
[1:39:39] on and I know this song and I stand up I
[1:39:41] say this is the time so I got and I
[1:39:44] joined the prayer line
[1:39:45] and it was a really long prayer line and
[1:39:48] it's lots of time for the anointing to
[1:39:49] wear off and you're standing there
[1:39:50] you're like oh dear can I turn around
[1:39:53] now I don't want to go through this
[1:39:55] prayer line Lord I don't like people
[1:39:56] praying for me I don't like this at all
[1:39:59] and I get up there and I'm one person
[1:40:00] away from the preacher and the preach is
[1:40:01] standing there he's praying for the
[1:40:02] person in front of me and everything
[1:40:03] just getting so much worse and he's got
[1:40:05] one trump card and
[1:40:08] it's it's this card that says you do not
[1:40:11] like being prayed for remember what's
[1:40:13] happened before you could the same thing
[1:40:15] could happen to you if this preacher
[1:40:16] puts his hands on you and I was standing
[1:40:18] there I was like nope you know what I
[1:40:21] just I do anything for Tam anything
[1:40:24] even if it meant that I could go through
[1:40:26] the same thing that I went
[1:40:28] through i' do it again for
[1:40:31] Tam so I was stand there and I said Lord
[1:40:33] if there's anything in my life that
[1:40:34] would stop me now from being somebody
[1:40:37] who could pray for Tam whole hearted if
[1:40:39] there's anything that would come out of
[1:40:40] my own in this prayer I just I ask you'd
[1:40:44] take it away from me
[1:40:45] Lord and then and then it's my turn you
[1:40:49] know the person in front's moved on and
[1:40:51] I'm standing there and I'm just thinking
[1:40:52] let's just get this over done with you
[1:40:53] know let's just move through this he
[1:40:54] doesn't know anything about me what's he
[1:40:56] going to pray some kind of generic
[1:40:57] prayer like this guy doesn't have a clue
[1:41:00] so this preacher standing he's not he's
[1:41:02] not you know bringing me forward so I'm
[1:41:04] waiting there and I you know sneak a
[1:41:05] little peek I'm like what's he up to and
[1:41:07] he's just standing there singing okay
[1:41:09] what's what's the brother up to so he
[1:41:11] pulls me and he leans down he says
[1:41:13] sister are you here for yourself or for
[1:41:16] someone
[1:41:18] else I opened my eyes I stand up
[1:41:21] straight I said what he said
[1:41:23] are you I Saidi here for someone else he
[1:41:26] said God told me to ask you
[1:41:32] that and this man who doesn't know me he
[1:41:35] doesn't know T he doesn't know anything
[1:41:37] about the situation leading up to Camp
[1:41:39] he prays with me for T of salvation
[1:41:53] and then as I leave the line I just I
[1:41:55] feel there's a revelation in my heart I
[1:41:57] think okay she's safe it's okay you know
[1:42:01] my sincerity touched God I was willing
[1:42:05] to go through anything for her and I'd
[1:42:06] sacrific everything for her God saw that
[1:42:09] and now we're on the same page fighting
[1:42:11] the same
[1:42:13] battle but it's funny because this
[1:42:16] preacher when he was praying for me he
[1:42:18] started praying about these these men
[1:42:22] who you know
[1:42:24] when their friend had policy I think it
[1:42:26] was and Jesus was preaching in a house
[1:42:28] they climbed to the top of the house and
[1:42:30] they cut a hole in the roof and they let
[1:42:31] their friend down and he was praying for
[1:42:33] me and he's like thank you Lord for the
[1:42:34] sister who's who's come all this way to
[1:42:37] let her friend into the house or
[1:42:38] something like that you know he referred
[1:42:39] to it very heavily and then I come back
[1:42:42] and and this doesn't happen to me but I
[1:42:44] get an urge I think wouldn't it be great
[1:42:45] just while I'm you know cleaning my room
[1:42:47] I put on last week's sermon like the
[1:42:49] good little Christian I am and I turn it
[1:42:51] on and one of the scriptures that Ben
[1:42:53] used was the one from Luke where his
[1:42:55] friends let the guy with py down into
[1:42:57] the house
[1:42:59] Hallelujah so it's just a lot of things
[1:43:03] happened that camp and I think that
[1:43:06] we're going to see the fruits of it
[1:43:08] because it's just small things but as we
[1:43:09] were leaving I was pretty tired and you
[1:43:11] know I was waiting for for my friends to
[1:43:14] be picked up from the factory and Tam's
[1:43:16] over there and she's being really
[1:43:17] annoying you know she's like in my ear
[1:43:19] but she's in my ear singing I'm so
[1:43:21] blessed Hallelujah I'm blessed I'm so
[1:43:23] blessed Hallelujah I'm blessed and she
[1:43:26] doesn't know that song but she learned
[1:43:27] at a camp because I prayed I prayed that
[1:43:30] t would come to Camp so I just want to
[1:43:32] say that if you see T coming to church
[1:43:35] it's because I prayed for it
[1:43:39] okay amen thank you
[1:43:42] amen praise the
[1:43:45] Lord
[1:43:47] hallelujah amen we believe in a miracle
[1:43:50] working God don't we we believe
