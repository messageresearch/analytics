[41:10] time of need so this morning we are
[41:12] going to read
[41:14] and then we just read one scripture and
[41:16] then we sit down then we will read the
[41:18] rest so i would like you to
[41:20] relax and
[41:21] in the presence of the lord i believe
[41:23] you have come expecting
[41:26] and
[41:26] let's read the book of revelation
[41:28] chapter nine
[41:30] we read revelation chapter nine
[41:36] we are in the presence of the lord this
[41:37] morning
[41:39] let us be aware of that let us be aware
[41:41] and not take it for granted it's not
[41:43] just coming to church every sunday
[41:46] we are in the presence of god
[41:49] being when moses was in the presence of
[41:51] the lord as we have had on wednesday
[41:52] brother onions
[41:54] as we have heard when he was in the
[41:55] presence of the lord
[41:57] things changed
[41:59] so when we are in the presence of the
[42:00] lord you know is worse than when you are
[42:03] going for an interview
[42:04] you know when you go for an interview
[42:06] have you ever been in a panel what is
[42:09] called a panel
[42:10] and they are all sitting around the
[42:11] table looking at you only the
[42:14] nervousness
[42:15] you you don't know what to say
[42:17] when
[42:18] so we are in the presence of god this
[42:20] morning is so serious more than that
[42:23] interview
[42:24] and that's how we need to be aware and
[42:26] all our senses must be aware and alert
[42:30] and be able to take the foot from the
[42:32] peak of the mother our great mother
[42:35] eagle feeding us don't miss
[42:38] revelation chapter nine
[42:40] uh we shall start from verse three we'll
[42:42] just read two verses revelation chapter
[42:45] nine uh my bible
[42:49] see if you read your bible too much
[42:51] sometimes
[42:52] it gets torn
[42:54] and you don't want to throw it away
[42:56] revelation chapter 9
[42:57] the bible says
[42:59] and they came out a smoke
[43:02] locust upon the earth
[43:04] and upon them that
[43:06] that
[43:08] was given power
[43:10] as the scorpions of the earth
[43:13] have power
[43:16] and it was commanded them that they
[43:18] should not hate the grass of the earth
[43:21] neither any green thing
[43:23] neither any tree
[43:25] but only those men which have no not the
[43:28] seal of god in their foreheads
[43:32] let us pray once more heavenly father
[43:35] we know we can eat too much talk too
[43:37] much
[43:38] exercise too much drive too much
[43:41] walk too much but we'll never never pray
[43:44] too much
[43:45] we just we just feel
[43:47] to talk to you and say father we have
[43:49] read your weight
[43:50] we ask your blessings upon it
[43:53] lord your word is in the interpreted
[43:56] when it manifests in our lives
[43:58] i pray that you anointed that you anoint
[44:01] both the speaker and the hearer alike
[44:03] this morning we depend on you my father
[44:05] my god we just commit the service into
[44:08] your hands this morning by faith in the
[44:10] name of our lord jesus christ amen
[44:13] god bless you please enjoy the comfort
[44:15] of your seats
[44:16] amen
[44:18] so
[44:19] let me um i think i'm i'm also fastened
[44:22] up
[44:23] this morning i would like us to speak
[44:26] about
[44:27] a thought that says the time of sealing
[44:29] away
[44:31] the time of sealing away how many know
[44:34] the meaning of the word seal
[44:38] not the one there in the ocean
[44:40] but a seal you know when you seal an
[44:42] envelope and you close it
[44:44] and you put a seal on it and you send it
[44:47] away right or you're sending a puzzle
[44:50] and you seal it
[44:51] which means um there is something that
[44:54] is inside that envelope
[44:56] there is something that is inside the
[44:58] puzzle or the seal behind the seal
[45:00] there's something so you seal it with
[45:02] something inside and you send it away
[45:06] you don't put everything in there you
[45:08] put only the things that are supposed to
[45:10] go in there kuriya and you seal it
[45:14] are we together so we want to talk about
[45:17] that time of the ceiling away which is
[45:19] now
[45:20] the time for me
[45:22] and for you to be sealed
[45:25] the bible says until the day of our
[45:28] redemption so so now if you expect this
[45:32] morning you are going to receive so i
[45:34] can see expectation on your eyes you are
[45:37] even scaring me you you're making me
[45:39] never so i'm going to look
[45:41] i'm going to look right above your head
[45:44] so that uh
[45:46] the lord can take over and give you not
[45:48] me amen
[45:50] so we have read there and then i would
[45:52] like us to read before we just expand on
[45:54] that topic i want us to read malachi
[45:58] alaka chapter 4 we know the scripture am
[46:01] i right
[46:02] we know the scripture
[46:05] uh raise up your hands there in video
[46:07] land
[46:08] we are in the same service
[46:09] let's read malachi malacca is the last
[46:11] book of the
[46:12] old testament
[46:15] malakai
[46:17] we know the scripture very well but i
[46:18] just want to i want us to read it so
[46:20] that we can emphasize on it
[46:23] we'll read malachi chapter 4 from verse
[46:27] and verse 6
[46:29] behold i will send you elijah
[46:31] the prophet before the coming
[46:34] of the great and dreadful day of the
[46:36] lord
[46:37] i god will send you elijah
[46:42] before that day comes that is it that
[46:44] day will be dreadful
[46:46] but it will be great
[46:48] and he
[46:50] who
[46:51] allied
[46:53] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[46:55] their children
[46:57] right
[46:58] we know that has happened right
[47:01] and the heart of the children to their
[47:04] fathers
[47:05] and that time is now
[47:08] otherwise
[47:09] the bible says lest i come and smite the
[47:12] earth with a curse
[47:14] so that before god can come and smite
[47:16] this earth with a curse
[47:18] the heart of the children
[47:21] must be turned back to the heart of the
[47:23] fathers
[47:24] our forefathers right at the beginning
[47:27] our forefathers
[47:30] lived alive
[47:31] we can see it in the book of acts we can
[47:34] see it in the uh
[47:36] um
[47:37] gospels
[47:38] right they have lived alive they have
[47:41] lived with the lord jesus and they went
[47:43] and wrote it our forefathers we see
[47:45] through the life of paul those are our
[47:47] fathers in the faith
[47:49] right and now that was the beginning of
[47:51] the gentile dispensation and now we are
[47:54] at the end of the gentile dispensation
[47:58] what was at the beginning must be at the
[48:01] end are we together
[48:02] so we are just going to try to take it
[48:04] easy and a teaching type of a a service
[48:07] and if the lord saw it see it fit will
[48:11] preach in there amen i always like the
[48:13] preaching but the lord sometimes wants
[48:15] to teach because the prophet says
[48:17] teaching it it takes you to a different
[48:19] level amen
[48:21] now
[48:22] now that
[48:23] this is the time where the hearts of the
[48:25] children must be back to the brothers
[48:26] this is the context i want to give you
[48:28] that
[48:29] where we are today as the children the
[48:32] pentecostal children our hearts must be
[48:35] turned back to the
[48:36] fathers
[48:38] whatever happened to them whatever they
[48:40] did whatever they went through whatever
[48:42] god used them to do must come to pass in
[48:46] our life before god comes to smite the
[48:49] earth so the question is are we there
[48:52] yet are we getting there
[48:54] right
[48:55] because
[48:56] they
[48:57] walked on the street of jerusalem
[48:59] as they were walking their shadows the
[49:02] shadow of the office of of peter was it
[49:05] peter just touched a sick man and he
[49:07] stand up and he's healed
[49:09] them they were at the point where they
[49:11] were tortured
[49:13] they suffered
[49:17] and the bible warned us and said hey
[49:19] consider it all joy
[49:21] prepare to suffer
[49:23] right
[49:25] remember it's not you who's suffering it
[49:27] is just the flesh you are not this flesh
[49:30] it's not it's the flesh that is
[49:32] suffering but you your spirit is joyful
[49:35] because you are not of this world so now
[49:38] consider it a joy
[49:40] when all sorts of
[49:41] persecutions and torture and whatever
[49:44] comes your way
[49:46] and i can tell you now brothers and
[49:47] sisters it has just begun
[49:50] it has just begun this is the time and
[49:52] that is why it's important for us to
[49:54] talk about this title
[49:57] ceiling away
[49:59] because the prophet taught us
[50:01] that even the bible that to be sealed
[50:04] away
[50:05] by what
[50:06] by the seal of god
[50:09] that has already
[50:11] you are in
[50:13] no more argument no more debates that
[50:15] means it is very very very very critical
[50:18] it's very important for you for me to be
[50:21] sealed away
[50:23] because while we are being sealed away
[50:26] while we are being sealed and ready for
[50:28] be to be couriered into heaven there's
[50:30] also a ceiling
[50:32] another ceiling out
[50:36] are we together the enemy
[50:39] you see there's always two spirits we'll
[50:41] see as we go along god is busy with this
[50:44] process the devil is busy
[50:46] as god seals the devil wants to seal
[50:48] also
[50:50] as god is fighting the devil is fight so
[50:52] we'll see as we going along so our time
[50:54] for sealing away as the bride of god is
[50:56] now
[50:58] it's not the time to change us to make
[51:00] us um the bright it's not the time to
[51:03] change us to make us something no no you
[51:05] are you are a bright you are the bride
[51:08] you were predestinated to be a bride but
[51:11] you must come to a point of the
[51:13] manifestation of who you are
[51:15] that's what you are you are right all we
[51:18] are doing is ministers all we are trying
[51:20] to do but all what the prophet is trying
[51:22] to do all what the gospel the bible is
[51:24] trying to do is just to try to bring you
[51:27] as the seed to the fruition to where
[51:30] originally you were
[51:32] that's all
[51:33] so so so let's let's let's get ready to
[51:37] be silting
[51:39] to go back to our original picture the
[51:42] picture that the lord saw when he
[51:44] created that's all we're doing right so
[51:47] if you find that it's a bit
[51:48] uncomfortable that is a bit rough that
[51:51] is a bit no no don't fight it up
[51:53] accept it
[51:55] me include it
[51:57] accept it because that is what is taking
[52:00] you to your original state how you where
[52:03] you were before the prophet says we are
[52:06] going back we are going back to aiden as
[52:09] condition help brother andy always push
[52:11] it this thing is crushing me a bit i'll
[52:13] put it here somewhere
[52:15] maybe i can put it on the jacket we are
[52:17] going back to
[52:19] uh adam we are going back not adam to
[52:21] eden
[52:22] yeah i just want to put it here on the
[52:25] yeah yeah i think it's just
[52:28] see what the brother is doing is just
[52:30] quality assuring it
[52:32] that you can also take it as the process
[52:34] of sealing away because right now he has
[52:37] checked it i'm comfortable here he makes
[52:39] sure that i'm not it's not scratching me
[52:42] if you leave it like that
[52:43] then that is not a complete sealed
[52:45] product
[52:46] because it's bothering me but now it
[52:48] everything must be quality assured you
[52:51] must be quality assured before you are
[52:54] sealed away
[52:55] are we together
[52:56] so sailing away involves tests and
[52:58] trials
[52:59] it involves temptations it involves
[53:02] torture it involves happiness it
[53:04] involves peace that passes understanding
[53:06] the peace beyond what you are going
[53:08] through the peace beyond what the devil
[53:10] is trying
[53:12] and once you get to that point the enemy
[53:14] does not know what to do he's frustrated
[53:17] the enemy
[53:18] because he knows that even if he kills
[53:20] you there's nothing he can do
[53:22] absolutely nothing he actually i think
[53:24] the devil sometimes just prefers not
[53:26] just to kill you yet
[53:29] because he thinks maybe he can still you
[53:31] know
[53:32] divert you
[53:33] so so so for him paul told him clearly
[53:36] for me to die
[53:37] it's a game
[53:39] to live is christ
[53:40] so
[53:41] with a believer we are way beyond this
[53:44] flesh brother indeed so now this is the
[53:47] time when we need to come to the
[53:49] realization that we must be sealed away
[53:53] and make sure
[53:55] in my language we say and make double
[53:57] sure
[53:59] yes let's read ephesians chapter one
[54:03] ephesians one
[54:05] i love ephesians how many loves are
[54:07] visions
[54:08] i love the book of ephesians
[54:12] let's just uh
[54:13] read it calmly taking our time it's
[54:16] sunday morning today
[54:18] and uh
[54:20] if you see me preaching you must know
[54:22] that all the other tyres are fully
[54:24] booked
[54:26] all the other tires i'm the spare of the
[54:27] space so so you must know that all the
[54:30] other tires
[54:31] are fully
[54:33] on the car working their threads are
[54:36] finished are getting finished they are
[54:38] working so we have to take the space of
[54:41] the space which is me
[54:43] so don't be don't be don't be surprised
[54:45] if sometimes i miss something just eat
[54:48] because an eagle knows how the mother
[54:50] eagle feeds you so just enjoy because as
[54:54] i told you it's not up to me who's
[54:56] preaching the eagle knows the cry of the
[54:58] mother the smell of the mother the kind
[55:01] of food the way the mother feeds the
[55:03] eagle knows and that's how i want you to
[55:06] fit that way this morning
[55:08] right ephesians 1.
[55:12] we'll read it from uh verse 18 to 14.
[55:15] are we together oh yeah thank you my
[55:16] brother for coming with me i forget this
[55:18] thing
[55:19] the bible says
[55:21] listen to this carefully
[55:23] in whom he also trusted
[55:25] after that he had the word of truth the
[55:29] gospel of your salvation
[55:31] in whom also after that he believed he
[55:35] was sealed
[55:36] with that holy spirit of promise
[55:39] did you get that did you get that
[55:41] yes you are sealed
[55:46] with the holy spirit of promise
[55:49] so there that that is the seal they're
[55:51] still starting to image
[55:53] the seal is starting to emerge what
[55:55] seals you
[55:56] the holy spirit that's the seal of god
[55:59] that is the one that the lord uses to
[56:01] seal you in you know when something is
[56:03] sealed
[56:05] let me show you something there
[56:08] you see you see that picture
[56:11] now the thing on the side
[56:13] has gone through a rigorous process in
[56:16] the factory
[56:17] it has gone through a process of being
[56:20] cleaned being checked tested everything
[56:25] and then they take the contents that are
[56:28] in that thing and they also make sure
[56:30] that the contents are of good quality
[56:34] to be exported
[56:36] to be exported to important clients who
[56:38] already paid the money
[56:41] and they checked how long why is in the
[56:44] sheep transported how long it can last
[56:48] in other words they take the best of the
[56:50] best quality and they put it in there
[56:52] after a thorough process and then they
[56:55] put it in the
[56:56] team the cleaning must be okay
[57:00] tested quality assured the contents in
[57:03] the teeth same thing same process and
[57:05] then when they finish
[57:07] the machine comes brother onions will
[57:09] know in the factory then all the other
[57:11] engineering brothers then they they seal
[57:12] it
[57:14] that team
[57:15] that thing you cannot open it
[57:18] for you to open it you need something
[57:20] called a tin opener
[57:21] you need a a knife when i grew up we
[57:24] never used tin openers we took a knife
[57:26] and we just go on the side you can cut
[57:28] yourself because that thing it is sealed
[57:31] until the day of his redemption until
[57:33] the day of redemption of the contents
[57:37] now it is
[57:39] after sealed
[57:41] then they put a stamp
[57:43] a seal
[57:44] of approval
[57:46] the quality ashore is a great job if you
[57:48] are a quality assurance because you are
[57:50] the one the last man who checked this
[57:51] thing before it goes out
[57:53] the day it goes out
[57:55] it's out
[57:56] and there at that process where they do
[57:58] quality assurance some goes by the
[58:00] wayside
[58:02] this one no no still can be put on this
[58:05] one this one no
[58:07] this is what no approval no the belt of
[58:09] approval goes this way then they go
[58:11] they go sealed
[58:13] sealed
[58:15] sealed not approved they just fall in
[58:17] the tinder we are going to throw those
[58:19] ones away
[58:20] hell
[58:22] now you and me we are those ones that
[58:25] are being sealed
[58:28] as we speak
[58:29] into heaven and until the day of our
[58:32] redemption right so the day i buy that
[58:35] tin attack and save and i open i'm
[58:37] actually i'm redeeming
[58:41] are we together
[58:42] so now
[58:43] efficiency said um
[58:47] i'll go back a little bit again
[58:49] all right
[58:50] ephesians said
[58:52] ye were sealed with that holy spirit of
[58:55] promise
[58:57] the holy spirit is a promise and you are
[58:59] sealed with it right
[59:02] now verse 14 which now listen to this
[59:04] exciting verse please let's be together
[59:06] just enjoy listening
[59:09] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[59:12] do you know what is an earnest
[59:14] and ernest when when we say something
[59:18] when you say um
[59:19] how can i put it you see when you go to
[59:21] the shop and put a bond or you put a
[59:24] deposit
[59:25] you see you are putting an ns you are
[59:27] you are depositing something
[59:29] that thing belongs to you they cannot
[59:31] sell it
[59:32] you have deposited it
[59:35] potentially it is yours actually not
[59:37] even potential it is yours
[59:40] right
[59:41] now the endness of our inheritance the
[59:44] endness of our inheritance is the holy
[59:46] spirit it when you are sealed with the
[59:48] holy spirit that is the earnest
[59:52] you are you have made it into heaven
[59:56] so how important can that be
[59:58] that the purpose
[1:00:00] of our daily life
[1:00:03] every second thought must be to make
[1:00:05] sure
[1:00:06] that you are sealed to make sure that
[1:00:09] you are ready because the bible says the
[1:00:11] bible says you don't know the day
[1:00:14] and the hour
[1:00:15] of his coming
[1:00:17] but he makes sure that you are sealed
[1:00:20] to work out your salvation with the fear
[1:00:23] and trembling
[1:00:25] knowing not he can come any minute
[1:00:27] you know that he's coming
[1:00:29] he has given you the seal
[1:00:31] you must make sure
[1:00:33] that you live the life
[1:00:35] that correspond with that ceiling
[1:00:38] are we together
[1:00:41] which is the endness of our inheritance
[1:00:42] until the redemption of the patches
[1:00:45] possession
[1:00:47] you know that verse you can just repeat
[1:00:48] it over and over and over every day
[1:00:51] unto the praise of his glory so the
[1:00:54] enemy of our inheritance
[1:00:56] is the holy spirit it has it's been
[1:00:58] given for us it's been given to us as an
[1:01:02] anus as a deposit right now which means
[1:01:05] you are his you are in once the seal of
[1:01:07] the holy spirit is put upon you you are
[1:01:09] in
[1:01:10] but now
[1:01:11] can i reverse it a bit
[1:01:13] can i reverse it
[1:01:15] if you are not sealed
[1:01:17] what how am i going to know
[1:01:19] how are you going to know that's the
[1:01:21] question we need to go back to say ah
[1:01:23] it's not just a foregone conclusion
[1:01:26] it is a falcon conclusion that you are a
[1:01:28] child of god but what do you do and the
[1:01:30] fruits that you bear actually illustrate
[1:01:33] or demonstrate whether that is true or
[1:01:35] not
[1:01:37] is it hard to say
[1:01:38] that is simple
[1:01:40] so your fruits
[1:01:42] shows that ah this one has been sealed
[1:01:45] this one is not sealed
[1:01:47] what you bear every day so we need to be
[1:01:49] careful and make sure that the fruits
[1:01:52] that we bear
[1:01:53] right the fruit that the lord jesus bear
[1:01:56] through us the fruit of the spirit
[1:01:58] the fruit of the spirit that's what we
[1:02:00] are giving every day are we together
[1:02:03] another scripture ephesians chapter 4
[1:02:07] now this one this one have cut it a
[1:02:08] little bit
[1:02:09] [Music]
[1:02:11] and ephesians 4 verse 8
[1:02:16] right
[1:02:19] it says here
[1:02:20] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[1:02:23] whereby you are sealed
[1:02:27] this feeling is very important
[1:02:29] now
[1:02:31] imagine
[1:02:33] imagine that content in the tin
[1:02:36] will start to temper with the seal
[1:02:39] and grieve the seal
[1:02:42] what should what kind of a commotion
[1:02:44] would be
[1:02:45] imagine if the contents in the envelope
[1:02:47] start to bulge and and do whatever sorts
[1:02:50] of things is tempering with the seals
[1:02:53] if he starts to misbehave
[1:02:55] if you start to grieve the holy spirit
[1:02:58] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:03:00] your redemption that's dangerous
[1:03:04] so we must not grieve him
[1:03:06] the question is how do we grieve the
[1:03:09] holy spirit right and that may be the
[1:03:12] topic of some other day but grieve him
[1:03:14] be led by him right go according to the
[1:03:17] leading of the spirit every day amen
[1:03:23] we are sealed until the day of your
[1:03:24] redemption
[1:03:25] now
[1:03:26] the greatest thing and the greatest uh
[1:03:28] uh interest you know i forgot these
[1:03:31] classes are not the right ones for long
[1:03:33] distance
[1:03:35] they're just for here but i can see
[1:03:36] because i've got to copy him
[1:03:38] what is the greatest ambition for every
[1:03:40] believer
[1:03:42] what what should be the greatest wish
[1:03:45] you know we say there's a vision and
[1:03:47] there's a mission
[1:03:48] what is the greatest
[1:03:50] purpose of every believer or what is
[1:03:52] supposed to be
[1:03:54] because the prophet taught us that
[1:03:57] without that holy ghost
[1:04:00] sealed into your soul
[1:04:02] we must not even dream about the rapture
[1:04:06] so
[1:04:08] i can speak in tongues i can preach i
[1:04:12] can go to church all
[1:04:14] my life sister megan i can do anything
[1:04:17] i can feed the poor
[1:04:19] i can do anything
[1:04:22] love everyone my guru right and
[1:04:25] do whatever
[1:04:27] on this earth i can do
[1:04:29] but as long as i am not sealed
[1:04:35] by the holy spirit
[1:04:38] do you think i'll arrive at my
[1:04:39] destination
[1:04:40] that's the purpose of the message being
[1:04:43] preached that's the the reason why we
[1:04:46] say when you go home fit on the way
[1:04:48] when you go home pray when you go home
[1:04:51] have a closer relationship with the lord
[1:04:53] when you go home do your checks and
[1:04:55] balances in accounting we say you do
[1:04:57] your checks and balances why should we
[1:04:59] do that if we know that we bought we
[1:05:01] bought using a bank account for the
[1:05:03] church we bought all these things why
[1:05:04] should we be submitting financials
[1:05:06] brother isaac because we are doing
[1:05:08] checks and balances
[1:05:10] to make sure that everything was done
[1:05:13] properly correctly enough to the letter
[1:05:16] that's the reason that we do our checks
[1:05:18] and balances using the weight every day
[1:05:22] of our lives it's not a foregone
[1:05:24] conclusion that i got baptized i felt
[1:05:27] like i received the holy spirit that's
[1:05:29] it then i can live anyhow no no
[1:05:32] it's to every day
[1:05:34] and every hour
[1:05:35] to walk in the spirit
[1:05:37] to make sure because the devil
[1:05:40] he knows that is important therefore he
[1:05:42] creates an environment a setting of
[1:05:45] environment to deter you from exactly
[1:05:48] doing what i'm telling you from leaving
[1:05:51] each moment each day each second for the
[1:05:54] lord so he will create a setting around
[1:05:57] your life
[1:05:58] and he'll make it necessary he'll make
[1:06:01] it important for you to to wake up and
[1:06:04] pick up your phone every day because
[1:06:06] it's important i must look at my time
[1:06:11] he will make it
[1:06:12] so pleasuralized
[1:06:15] business work everything until our minds
[1:06:18] also they think fast we are just fast
[1:06:21] fast fast fast why because you cannot if
[1:06:25] i leave you god might take an
[1:06:27] opportunity on you
[1:06:28] so so us we have to be wise and know
[1:06:32] that our routine does not take us away
[1:06:35] from the lord to allocate time for god
[1:06:38] because if we don't redeem that time
[1:06:43] don't you think that will be unwise
[1:06:45] because we don't know when is the lord
[1:06:47] coming we have to be ever ready
[1:06:51] i cannot over emphasize that now to be
[1:06:54] born of the spirit
[1:06:56] to be born of the spirit that is what
[1:06:59] i'm saying we it's not enough just to be
[1:07:01] just to be baptized
[1:07:03] it's not enough it's not enough just to
[1:07:05] be justified
[1:07:07] it's not enough to be sanctified it is
[1:07:09] important that's the portion of the holy
[1:07:11] spirit but the ultimate goal
[1:07:15] is to be really baptized
[1:07:17] that's the ceiling point that's when me
[1:07:20] and you you young people
[1:07:22] you all time us
[1:07:24] make sure that our faith and our work
[1:07:27] does not become sterile
[1:07:31] are we together
[1:07:33] now the testing and quality assurance
[1:07:36] checking happens during this process
[1:07:39] this is the time when and the product is
[1:07:43] on the production line
[1:07:45] is moving on the belt via different
[1:07:47] stages moving towards the end of the
[1:07:51] process where it gets sealed and me and
[1:07:54] you
[1:07:54] with the with the endless expectation
[1:07:57] given unto us that's where we are and
[1:08:00] i'm telling you one of these days we're
[1:08:02] just going to jump into the courier bag
[1:08:04] of who we are
[1:08:06] one of these days it's going to happen
[1:08:09] it's about to happen
[1:08:11] all the signs are showing that is going
[1:08:13] to happen the problem is when and
[1:08:16] you are being set free and you need to
[1:08:18] be sealed and the holy spirit wants to
[1:08:21] seal you
[1:08:22] put
[1:08:24] for the rapture to take place and you
[1:08:26] are resisting
[1:08:28] you are not resisting by saying no i
[1:08:30] don't believe this
[1:08:32] just your actions
[1:08:34] just allowing the devil
[1:08:36] certain environment to control
[1:08:40] not allowing the holy spirit that is
[1:08:42] resisting because now that is a problem
[1:08:44] because it shall come to pass that in
[1:08:46] the process of your resistance or my
[1:08:48] resistance it shall come to pass that
[1:08:51] you know what they did to those slaves
[1:08:52] who did not want independence who did
[1:08:54] not want their freedom then they took
[1:08:56] them
[1:08:57] and then they make a hole on the e
[1:09:02] another seal
[1:09:04] that is a mark
[1:09:06] then they mark them
[1:09:09] and make a hole here
[1:09:12] i don't know whether they were cutting a
[1:09:14] piece all the way making a hole so that
[1:09:17] that is a mark that this person they
[1:09:20] shall never
[1:09:21] they get their freedom their liberty
[1:09:24] their guarantee their fate at it
[1:09:28] so we need to be careful
[1:09:30] that our day-to-day life
[1:09:32] that the enemy does not take grasp of us
[1:09:35] that the holy spirit which is already
[1:09:37] given to us as the seal takes full
[1:09:39] control of our lives
[1:09:41] to guarantee our going away yes sir
[1:09:44] hallelujah
[1:09:46] so
[1:09:46] let me just go to the next one here
[1:09:49] i've got the first
[1:09:51] quote
[1:09:54] we we spoke about the seal of approval
[1:09:57] we spoke about the process of how that
[1:09:59] tin that product gets to the finish line
[1:10:02] and how is sealed and the importance of
[1:10:04] the contents and we have spoken about
[1:10:06] the rigorous process that it goes
[1:10:08] through
[1:10:09] and that's me
[1:10:11] and that's you you need to see ourselves
[1:10:13] as that team getting a seal of approval
[1:10:16] which is the holy spirit hallelujah now
[1:10:18] let's just get to that first quote
[1:10:21] now
[1:10:22] some people come to church
[1:10:24] just for an emotional part
[1:10:29] some people
[1:10:30] come to church just to sing
[1:10:34] if it's not you it's all right it's okay
[1:10:36] if it's not you it's all right but if
[1:10:38] you if you can identify with this if you
[1:10:41] find that coming to church you get more
[1:10:44] help here than seeing for singing
[1:10:47] than the word that is talking to you
[1:10:49] then
[1:10:50] are we together
[1:10:51] some people come in church just to enjoy
[1:10:54] a good singing that's all right
[1:10:56] man the singing today was beautiful so
[1:10:59] what was the minister preaching about um
[1:11:05] what was he talking about you see now
[1:11:08] you enjoyed the songs they uplifted you
[1:11:10] which is wonderful
[1:11:12] but that's not it
[1:11:14] right
[1:11:15] some people come to church and join
[1:11:18] church just to hide their meanness
[1:11:22] you know that so that you you cannot
[1:11:25] just know my other part my other
[1:11:28] nature
[1:11:29] just to hide you know when when you are
[1:11:31] among the believers the atmosphere
[1:11:33] around the believers it can even it can
[1:11:36] even soothe the most dangerous person
[1:11:39] it can because the atmosphere is
[1:11:41] overcoming this atmosphere is so good
[1:11:44] that any evil person can be among us
[1:11:48] and just be calm
[1:11:50] that is why when the mother is about to
[1:11:51] give birth they say the prophet taught
[1:11:54] us that you know a calm spirit around
[1:11:57] him because the angel
[1:11:58] angels are here right now
[1:12:00] right that is why evil demons run around
[1:12:04] they don't know they are frustrated they
[1:12:05] are calling for support they are calling
[1:12:07] for help because you create an
[1:12:09] atmosphere through the singing through
[1:12:10] your preparation your expectation your
[1:12:12] prayer through the week praying for the
[1:12:14] service and then the atmosphere of the
[1:12:16] lord is here even the person who came
[1:12:19] terrible terrified comes here and he's
[1:12:22] just he or she just get caught
[1:12:24] right so now
[1:12:28] some some come to church sincerely
[1:12:32] did you hear that they come sincerely
[1:12:34] but they don't never have to attach from
[1:12:38] god
[1:12:40] that is this is painful
[1:12:42] come to church
[1:12:44] sincerely
[1:12:47] where am i
[1:12:48] okay
[1:12:49] some people come to church
[1:12:52] some come to church sincerely
[1:12:54] but don't never have to touch
[1:12:57] a touch from god
[1:13:00] i i don't know how to express this
[1:13:02] painful state
[1:13:05] of affairs
[1:13:06] where
[1:13:07] you come to church
[1:13:08] all the years
[1:13:10] you come to church
[1:13:11] faithfully
[1:13:12] all the time sincerely
[1:13:15] you know to be told that you are
[1:13:16] sincerely wrong something that is so
[1:13:19] painful
[1:13:20] it would be better if you are not
[1:13:21] sincere at all
[1:13:23] because maybe the lord maybe you didn't
[1:13:25] know
[1:13:26] but you know
[1:13:28] and you are sincere
[1:13:29] but you are you are not having it
[1:13:32] that is painful
[1:13:34] now and the only thing not my
[1:13:36] intelligence not my wisdom not my
[1:13:38] experience not my nothing but only him
[1:13:41] only the holy spirit he can sincerely
[1:13:44] put you on the right strike
[1:13:46] correctly to be sincerely correct
[1:13:48] only he can do that and he he's got
[1:13:51] everything in the hands in his hands
[1:13:54] he's got everything he's that is why
[1:13:56] it's important for us to seek and to
[1:13:58] have him and to make sure every morning
[1:14:00] you say holy spirit my dear are you here
[1:14:02] yes my girl yes my boy i am right here
[1:14:05] with you is it you how can i see you
[1:14:08] today in my life
[1:14:10] and he shows you the manifestations of
[1:14:12] his deeds and actions he manifests them
[1:14:15] to you in your life and you wait and
[1:14:18] learn from the holy spirit to see and
[1:14:21] then you come and testify
[1:14:23] the deeds of the holy spirit in your
[1:14:25] life using you
[1:14:28] speaking and conversing with you on a
[1:14:30] daily basis that is the job of the holy
[1:14:32] spirit we we need to pull back and allow
[1:14:35] him to do
[1:14:37] but the flesh fights death
[1:14:40] we don't want to be sincerely wrong
[1:14:42] we don't want to be sincere and come but
[1:14:44] never get it never get to the point of
[1:14:47] being sealed
[1:14:53] but you see when god calls a man
[1:14:56] no man can come to me except my father
[1:14:59] draws him first
[1:15:02] it is the work of god
[1:15:04] but you see like brother ben always say
[1:15:06] god is not
[1:15:07] the one who just pull you and force you
[1:15:10] there's a part
[1:15:12] you choose him
[1:15:14] the choosing of god and giving and
[1:15:16] surrendering total surrender to him then
[1:15:19] that's when god does this yes
[1:15:22] that's when god come and he actually
[1:15:24] draws you and put you and seal you
[1:15:28] but you
[1:15:29] give
[1:15:30] everything
[1:15:32] surrender everything
[1:15:34] no reservations like when a woman
[1:15:36] surrenders to a man and he says i
[1:15:39] surrender to you as my husband and we
[1:15:42] give him the authority
[1:15:44] he gets the authority now the father is
[1:15:46] no more having authority to the girl
[1:15:48] anymore it is now handing it over to the
[1:15:52] new husband
[1:15:53] that's what happens in that process
[1:15:55] that's what i'm trying to emphasize to
[1:15:56] you now no man can come to me except my
[1:15:59] father draws him now
[1:16:01] throws him first and all that comes i
[1:16:03] will give him everlasting life
[1:16:06] raise him up
[1:16:08] at the last day that's what the prophet
[1:16:10] said
[1:16:11] then people think just because you go to
[1:16:13] church
[1:16:14] no no no my brother and sister just
[1:16:16] because you come to shakayana tabernacle
[1:16:19] doesn't mean anything
[1:16:21] it is a good thing it is a first step
[1:16:26] but it's just year one
[1:16:29] i'm sorry to say that but coming to
[1:16:32] sakana tabernacle is not part of the
[1:16:34] whole deal
[1:16:36] so oh that's all i have to do just to go
[1:16:40] to church be a pretty good fellow
[1:16:43] that's wrong brother you are deceived
[1:16:46] that's the prophet of god that we
[1:16:47] believe is him saying that just just to
[1:16:50] come to church alone is not sufficient
[1:16:52] so
[1:16:53] it is the life behind
[1:16:56] coming to church
[1:16:59] the life
[1:17:00] the life of you and the holy spirit i
[1:17:03] know t going slow make people
[1:17:06] relax and then you can you can end up
[1:17:08] snoozing but remember here as we said at
[1:17:11] the beginning it's like less than an
[1:17:13] interview
[1:17:15] you see when you're attending an
[1:17:17] interview
[1:17:18] even if one of the panel members can sit
[1:17:20] like this
[1:17:23] and he says yeah tell us i see on your
[1:17:25] cv here you said this this this
[1:17:29] and then
[1:17:31] he sleeps a bit the panel member
[1:17:33] you are awake you see him that ah this
[1:17:36] guy
[1:17:37] and that gives you more confidence that
[1:17:39] hey i'm gonna nail it even the panelist
[1:17:42] is
[1:17:43] dozy
[1:17:45] so you need to be alert because this is
[1:17:48] more than that listen to what i'm
[1:17:51] reading him because most of this that
[1:17:53] i'm reading here is not
[1:17:55] out of my mind it's not what i i just
[1:17:57] copied and put here all i'm doing i'm
[1:18:00] just putting the emphasis on what the
[1:18:02] prophet said
[1:18:04] right so it is the prophet who preached
[1:18:06] this in 55
[1:18:09] he is the one who preached in 55 03 12.
[1:18:12] he's the one and he said that's wrong my
[1:18:14] brother you are deceived is not just
[1:18:17] coming to church
[1:18:22] hallelujah
[1:18:23] help us my father my god
[1:18:26] now while coming to shaykh is extremely
[1:18:28] important because we cannot forsake the
[1:18:30] gathering together
[1:18:32] we can we have to fellowship it is part
[1:18:34] of the deal it's just part of the deal
[1:18:37] we cannot underestimate it we cannot
[1:18:39] develop it we cannot put it aside we
[1:18:42] have to come together to fellowship to
[1:18:44] to for the world to be pleased for us to
[1:18:46] participate that is part of the deal but
[1:18:49] the most most the cracks of the matter
[1:18:52] the core of the whole thing
[1:18:55] is my life
[1:18:56] that has been sealed away
[1:18:58] in the lord
[1:19:00] that is the deal that is the main thing
[1:19:01] second coat
[1:19:05] where am i about to go
[1:19:08] if we if we have served the lord you
[1:19:11] christians all these years
[1:19:14] it's time we were getting off of the
[1:19:18] the milk diet
[1:19:20] time we were able to eat some strong
[1:19:23] meat
[1:19:24] the strong meat is here for us
[1:19:28] it's time
[1:19:29] no it's time we cannot keep on brushing
[1:19:32] each other say no no no no no no no it's
[1:19:34] time for us to say hey sister that dress
[1:19:38] that you are wearing
[1:19:40] because why why am i saying that the
[1:19:42] prophet says here if we have served the
[1:19:46] lord you christians all these yes i'm
[1:19:50] not talking about a new believer there
[1:19:52] a new believer we understand and the
[1:19:55] lord will leave that person he or she
[1:19:57] will see our lives we'll experience it
[1:19:59] and go through the same process that we
[1:20:01] have gone but no me and you have been
[1:20:03] here for many years
[1:20:07] but you still want to be told how your
[1:20:09] hair should look like
[1:20:11] and your dress
[1:20:13] and your pants brother
[1:20:15] no those things will pass them they are
[1:20:18] down the line of the production line we
[1:20:20] are almost there where we are getting
[1:20:22] sealed to get out
[1:20:25] those things are behind there we are now
[1:20:27] moving higher
[1:20:30] almost to go home
[1:20:31] the same way we saw him leaving we're
[1:20:34] gonna see him he'll say to us come up
[1:20:36] either and we that's almost there so how
[1:20:39] can we still be struggling with the
[1:20:42] dress
[1:20:46] how can we still be struggling with ah
[1:20:49] no no that that brother no i don't like
[1:20:51] the way he talks
[1:20:53] i don't like it it stops my insight
[1:20:58] are you still
[1:21:01] are you are you still
[1:21:05] but the bible that i read me and you
[1:21:08] it says
[1:21:09] do not be easily provoked
[1:21:14] do not be easily
[1:21:16] provoked
[1:21:17] in other words the devil will come to
[1:21:19] you and kick you
[1:21:22] and kick you in a mean way
[1:21:26] maybe even use your brother
[1:21:28] or your sister
[1:21:30] no how are you going to react
[1:21:34] i don't really i really i really don't
[1:21:36] want to show my colors
[1:21:38] i don't want don't don't pull me
[1:21:41] to the extreme which extreme
[1:21:43] which extreme don't you want to be
[1:21:45] pulled to
[1:21:46] are you still having reservations not
[1:21:48] supposed to
[1:21:49] no more reservations you can pull my
[1:21:52] nose devil you know that man came to the
[1:21:54] prophet and they even did he they even
[1:21:57] pulled his nose
[1:21:58] and they said yeah take a picture now
[1:22:00] what did the brother do he remained calm
[1:22:03] hallelujah he remained calm
[1:22:05] because he knows who he is
[1:22:08] you see he's not he's not he's not
[1:22:10] confused by what the devil is doing he
[1:22:12] knows the devil is childish they say no
[1:22:14] no now come take this side
[1:22:17] then they did
[1:22:18] they did the same thing with jesus
[1:22:21] they did the same thing even at the
[1:22:22] cross they were spitting at him
[1:22:25] saying prophesy
[1:22:27] what did he do
[1:22:30] what did the lord jesus christ do he
[1:22:31] said lord forgive them
[1:22:33] he said
[1:22:35] you know when someone said to you
[1:22:38] you must run
[1:22:40] [Laughter]
[1:22:42] you must go back home and prepare
[1:22:45] your life
[1:22:46] because that person said is pitting you
[1:22:50] the lord said lord and that was true
[1:22:52] that's the best the lord could do
[1:22:54] to forgive them
[1:22:56] because they didn't know what they were
[1:22:58] doing
[1:23:00] that's what the lord said
[1:23:02] so
[1:23:03] the pentecostal brothers
[1:23:05] paul
[1:23:06] salas peter
[1:23:09] he said they said them they said no no
[1:23:11] you know what you know you know brothers
[1:23:12] and sisters no no don't worry don't
[1:23:14] crucify me this way the lord the way the
[1:23:16] lord was crucified you know me put my
[1:23:18] head upside down yes put me in the inner
[1:23:21] inner prison
[1:23:22] are we ready for that
[1:23:24] that's coming
[1:23:25] it's coming
[1:23:27] right when it comes it must find us
[1:23:30] sealed
[1:23:33] strong meat we need now
[1:23:35] no more milk
[1:23:37] milk is for my precious friend danny and
[1:23:39] them
[1:23:42] right
[1:23:43] us
[1:23:45] real
[1:23:46] fera bread
[1:23:47] steak
[1:23:49] to chew eat brother andy
[1:23:51] the one that is full of vitamins
[1:23:53] not fully done rare still with minerals
[1:23:58] what do you call it rare
[1:24:01] because if we eat it with those minerals
[1:24:03] like that no gout will affect us knock
[1:24:05] out of the devil
[1:24:07] we eat it like that
[1:24:09] cooked with minerals follow it
[1:24:12] fresh
[1:24:13] from the peak of the mother
[1:24:15] now listen to this
[1:24:17] find that and he said
[1:24:21] well let me show you something this is
[1:24:23] now a a a a young man talking to the
[1:24:26] prophet
[1:24:27] about the mug of the beast he's talking
[1:24:30] to the prophet he said okay he said well
[1:24:34] let me show you something the poor boy
[1:24:36] can you see what i'm reading
[1:24:37] the poor boy was of course in an
[1:24:39] illusion
[1:24:41] and he pulled out his pocket a great
[1:24:44] long piece of paper and that
[1:24:46] that had the statue of liberty on it he
[1:24:48] said
[1:24:49] there's a mark
[1:24:51] there's the mark of the beast
[1:24:53] the stage of liberty you know the statue
[1:24:54] of liberty in washington dc the one that
[1:24:57] is doing this he was telling the prophet
[1:24:58] that that's the mark of the beast an
[1:25:00] illusion
[1:25:02] and that's that's happening today again
[1:25:05] well we have had all kinds of rumors
[1:25:09] and i wrote them that thing in red is me
[1:25:13] conspiracy theories
[1:25:15] you see i cannot specifically tell you
[1:25:17] which conspiracy theory is exciting or
[1:25:20] not exciting they are all conspiracy
[1:25:22] theories
[1:25:23] the issue is that me and you must have a
[1:25:27] seal
[1:25:28] and whatever conspiracy theory true or
[1:25:32] false
[1:25:34] still brother sister
[1:25:37] that's the key still
[1:25:39] that's right and there will come many of
[1:25:41] them because even during the prophet's
[1:25:43] time he said we well we have had all
[1:25:47] kind of things and rumors
[1:25:49] they were there conspiracy theories
[1:25:51] people actually believe that the statue
[1:25:53] of liberty
[1:25:54] is the mug of the beast
[1:26:00] and today
[1:26:01] we are told that the mug of the beast is
[1:26:03] this
[1:26:04] the mark of the beast is dead you must
[1:26:06] be careful of the mark of the beast no
[1:26:08] no we must be careful that we have the
[1:26:11] seal
[1:26:13] that's what we must be careful about we
[1:26:15] must be careful that we are sealed in
[1:26:18] by the spirit of the living god by the
[1:26:20] washing of the waters of the world
[1:26:22] that's what we must be
[1:26:24] careful testing
[1:26:26] that's the first priority
[1:26:28] whatever is going to happen afterwards
[1:26:31] is immaterial
[1:26:33] is neither here nor there because listen
[1:26:37] whatever conspiracy theory can come
[1:26:39] let's say it comes to be true
[1:26:42] that i get tracked
[1:26:44] getting into a controversial territory
[1:26:46] now i'm aware of that that i get tracked
[1:26:48] by a vaccination
[1:26:51] let's presume that that is true okay
[1:26:54] let's put the hypothesis it's true
[1:26:57] right hypothesis meaning we are
[1:27:00] hypothetically saying as we are doing
[1:27:02] this research we want to test whether
[1:27:04] this is true or not
[1:27:06] we are putting an alternative hypothesis
[1:27:09] and a a hypothesis right we put it let's
[1:27:12] presume the hypothesis that is true that
[1:27:16] i'm vaccinated i'll be tracked
[1:27:19] then what
[1:27:21] what happens after i've been checked
[1:27:25] okay let's say that now they want to
[1:27:26] control me
[1:27:28] right
[1:27:29] now
[1:27:30] who didn't they control people before
[1:27:33] didn't they control people of old they
[1:27:37] anyhow they are controlling us
[1:27:39] but they are controlling the flesh
[1:27:41] you and me must get the seal
[1:27:45] that's the issue
[1:27:46] whether they're going to tell us to
[1:27:48] vaccinate 10 times
[1:27:51] and i die
[1:27:53] i want to die and go anyway
[1:27:56] are you ready to go
[1:27:58] imagine i was telling your brother
[1:28:00] yesterday i said imagine my brother
[1:28:03] i was talking to who
[1:28:05] i was talking one of the pastors i say
[1:28:07] imagine imagine if me my wife and all
[1:28:10] the four kids die
[1:28:12] god forbid because you still want us
[1:28:14] here imagine we still want you also
[1:28:16] imagine if we all go that will be the
[1:28:18] glorious glorious glorious moments for
[1:28:20] us to realize oh we are going together
[1:28:22] on our guys and there is our mansion
[1:28:25] already waiting
[1:28:28] us amen
[1:28:30] already without waking we don't know and
[1:28:32] we're all just going to say oh that
[1:28:34] vaccine was useful man lobby
[1:28:39] now
[1:28:40] please understand what i'm trying to say
[1:28:43] i'm trying to emphasize
[1:28:45] that our point of focus
[1:28:48] our point of priority brother and sister
[1:28:50] our time our efforts our energy our
[1:28:54] research
[1:28:55] must be getting on the seal
[1:28:58] and making sure that that still is
[1:29:00] maintained is there by you
[1:29:02] it does not
[1:29:03] grieve the holy spirit
[1:29:06] right that should be the priority
[1:29:08] otherwise afterwards once he was sealed
[1:29:12] he's the one who's going to control what
[1:29:14] you say
[1:29:15] what you do what you think how you react
[1:29:18] what every day is him
[1:29:20] you don't have to worry
[1:29:22] get him first
[1:29:24] don't be like a girl who wants to get
[1:29:26] married without the holy spirit
[1:29:29] no
[1:29:30] no
[1:29:31] friends
[1:29:32] no
[1:29:33] it's an end oh
[1:29:36] get the holy spirit
[1:29:38] then you get married
[1:29:41] to because him he will guide you to the
[1:29:43] one who is full of the spirit already
[1:29:46] right once you got it my girl i am free
[1:29:49] to let you go
[1:29:51] sister now
[1:29:52] free
[1:29:53] i'll be happily handing you over sorry
[1:29:56] i'm not your physical date but
[1:29:58] the point i'm trying to say is that once
[1:30:00] you've passed that stage
[1:30:02] it's not nothing to worry you don't have
[1:30:05] to worry
[1:30:08] not anymore he's the one who's guiding
[1:30:10] you you are not thinking your own
[1:30:12] thoughts anymore you are not acting your
[1:30:14] own actions you are going to find that
[1:30:16] you are sitting in kapiti
[1:30:19] but sitting in taranaki
[1:30:22] and isaac is sitting in an orcas
[1:30:25] but you're all thinking the same thing
[1:30:26] because the same spirit is on you you're
[1:30:28] not arguing on facebook
[1:30:35] no you're not debating
[1:30:37] because the spirit in you is the same
[1:30:41] that that was that was not part of what
[1:30:43] i prepared to speak no
[1:30:46] i want to say that this whole is the
[1:30:48] same spirit
[1:30:50] that was in christ jesus
[1:30:52] if he's in us
[1:30:53] we are going to be reacting or acting
[1:30:56] the same way as the city
[1:30:58] we are going to be thinking same line
[1:31:01] or
[1:31:02] it's like a puzzle you know a puzzle
[1:31:05] when we pick a puzzle sister maggie and
[1:31:07] we spend our time putting it together
[1:31:09] another piece doesn't say no no no no we
[1:31:11] don't cut it to make it fit
[1:31:14] no we don't we don't cut that portion to
[1:31:16] to force it no we don't do that it just
[1:31:19] fits
[1:31:20] nicely
[1:31:22] if my brother's got a strong point his
[1:31:24] strong point
[1:31:25] if this is my weak point it just fits
[1:31:27] onto my point
[1:31:29] like a hand and laugh
[1:31:32] ah and then i've got a strong point on
[1:31:34] my side and he's got a certain weak
[1:31:35] point that the lord has given to fulfill
[1:31:37] his purpose they just fit into mine we
[1:31:40] don't crash
[1:31:42] no no that's a problem that means that's
[1:31:44] the wrong puzzle it belongs somewhere
[1:31:47] it must go onto another another piece of
[1:31:49] the board
[1:31:50] huh and and and that brings us to
[1:31:52] someone maybe one day where you finding
[1:31:54] your position in the
[1:31:56] body finding your position because
[1:32:00] finding your position is so important in
[1:32:03] this body you are now still in the holy
[1:32:05] ghost navigates you and plays you
[1:32:08] positionally in the body
[1:32:11] because every part of the body
[1:32:15] has got a role to play
[1:32:19] every part
[1:32:21] i don't know what part you can mention
[1:32:22] and you say it's useless that's not your
[1:32:24] part
[1:32:26] the one that is useless it must it must
[1:32:27] go away it is a cancer it must be cut
[1:32:30] out out of the body but every part of
[1:32:32] the body has got a role to play
[1:32:36] then the importance of that role is
[1:32:38] known unto the owner of the body
[1:32:41] the head the head
[1:32:43] everything
[1:32:46] that's the same one for another time
[1:32:47] i want to finish quickly
[1:32:49] let's go to code
[1:32:51] number three i hope we've exhausted that
[1:32:54] one
[1:32:55] if we exhausted code number two that's
[1:32:57] fine
[1:32:59] code three
[1:33:01] let's see what he says there
[1:33:03] you must be born again
[1:33:05] to be born again
[1:33:07] we all know what is to be born again but
[1:33:10] you must it's not a you may be born
[1:33:13] again or you ought to born again or you
[1:33:15] know your mass is a must amen
[1:33:19] jesus answered and said unto him verily
[1:33:21] verily i say unto thee except a man be
[1:33:24] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[1:33:26] god let's go down to verse seven
[1:33:28] mother not
[1:33:29] oh sorry let's just read verse six that
[1:33:32] which is born of the flesh is
[1:33:34] flesh and that which is born of the
[1:33:37] spirit is spirit
[1:33:40] me and you must be born by the spirit
[1:33:44] mother not that i say unto you you must
[1:33:46] be born again because you must be born
[1:33:49] again that was nicodemus engaging with
[1:33:51] the lord trying to engage and to talk
[1:33:54] and now we find that as we go forward
[1:33:56] here in the spoken word called you must
[1:33:58] be born again the prophet says
[1:34:01] okay that that rate is not the prophet
[1:34:03] that's me
[1:34:05] you can put it on the bench if you don't
[1:34:06] swallow it nicely and i said you must be
[1:34:09] born again first and to be born again
[1:34:12] you must die first
[1:34:14] you must die first because let's be
[1:34:17] practical let's be practical have you
[1:34:19] ever seen a seed that we plant huh and
[1:34:23] it doesn't die but it grows and bear
[1:34:26] fruit without dying
[1:34:28] have you ever seen i've never seen if
[1:34:30] you plant a seed after a few days you go
[1:34:33] and you find that it has a reason road
[1:34:35] is fraught in africans we say fruit
[1:34:39] in other words rotten
[1:34:42] you will think there's no life there
[1:34:44] why jesus died in the cross and he was
[1:34:48] buried
[1:34:54] amen
[1:34:56] our souls are placed by faith on his on
[1:34:59] his on his brass altar
[1:35:01] god's judgment as we speak now we you
[1:35:04] are on the judgment seat you are being
[1:35:06] judged so don't say it's hard saying
[1:35:08] brother no no because you are being
[1:35:11] judged
[1:35:12] the world is judging you because you are
[1:35:14] not going to stand before the judgment
[1:35:16] seat
[1:35:17] you are already judged
[1:35:19] because by accepting you you are put on
[1:35:22] the brace on the brass
[1:35:24] on god's judgment and our offering is
[1:35:26] consumed now remember when elijah under
[1:35:30] those brass skies
[1:35:32] laid the offering of god upon the altar
[1:35:34] the offering was consumed
[1:35:37] by the fire
[1:35:39] that's what me and you are going through
[1:35:41] now
[1:35:43] so the weight
[1:35:44] is judging us
[1:35:46] right now
[1:35:49] baal could not consume his offering
[1:35:51] he could not i don't want to say this
[1:35:54] but i must say it and when you go to a
[1:35:56] church and accept their creeds and and
[1:35:59] and their forms of baptism and the
[1:36:01] offering
[1:36:02] that you are supposing yourself to lay
[1:36:05] upon them you might get up shivering
[1:36:07] speaking in tongues running all over the
[1:36:10] floor and you might get up weeping but
[1:36:13] if that offering has been received by
[1:36:15] god is consumed
[1:36:17] the world is dead to you
[1:36:19] you are gone
[1:36:21] for we reckon ourselves dead and buried
[1:36:26] we are dead and are we are hit in christ
[1:36:30] hit in christ and beside that then then
[1:36:33] after we are dead and buried and hidden
[1:36:36] christ
[1:36:37] then we are sealed
[1:36:40] with the spirit amen
[1:36:42] you see where the ceiling comes
[1:36:44] after the death
[1:36:46] dying to ourselves
[1:36:48] dying to our nature
[1:36:50] not get angry to have one without
[1:36:53] no no we don't do that so do you do to
[1:36:55] someone that i'll get so angry
[1:36:56] no no
[1:36:58] you haven't died
[1:36:59] you haven't died die
[1:37:01] let us die let braden paul die to
[1:37:05] himself
[1:37:07] and that scripture that the pastor right
[1:37:09] here then the new nature the spirit will
[1:37:12] be given so that the holy spirit can
[1:37:14] come and seal
[1:37:16] hallelujah i'll try to go fast now let's
[1:37:18] read the next paragraph there die to
[1:37:20] yourself you see what i mean now
[1:37:23] you are dead
[1:37:25] our souls are placed upon his divine
[1:37:27] judgment that's brass
[1:37:30] when our soul is placed upon the altar
[1:37:32] of divine judgment what was the penalty
[1:37:35] death
[1:37:36] and when you lay yourself upon the altar
[1:37:38] of god which is pronounced dead upon the
[1:37:40] sinner
[1:37:42] it's not actually you who's dying it's a
[1:37:44] sin i knew amen
[1:37:47] he dies
[1:37:48] and you live
[1:37:49] a new life
[1:37:51] right
[1:37:53] all our birthdays i think should be the
[1:37:54] day that we were born again
[1:37:57] how about that proposal
[1:38:01] you know the song that says when i was
[1:38:03] born again
[1:38:06] oh it was a happy day
[1:38:10] you know the song oh it was a happy day
[1:38:15] oh when i was born i gave a tissue one
[1:38:18] day he said it was a happy day when i
[1:38:20] was born again
[1:38:23] that should be our our birthday's from
[1:38:24] marion from now on
[1:38:27] we'll take it through the past and the
[1:38:28] deacon board and said brothers can you
[1:38:30] ratify
[1:38:32] that from now on our birthdays is going
[1:38:34] to be the day that we were born again
[1:38:36] that's the real bad day
[1:38:38] i want to jump quickly to finish
[1:38:42] right um let's jump to the next slide i
[1:38:46] want to emphasize on this point of being
[1:38:48] born again
[1:38:51] because
[1:38:56] many times we just take things easy and
[1:38:58] for granted
[1:39:00] and we presume
[1:39:03] that we are we are in
[1:39:06] but if we can be given a test
[1:39:09] an exam
[1:39:11] we may
[1:39:12] find that we don't pass 100 percent
[1:39:15] and with the lord pass mark is 100
[1:39:19] not 93
[1:39:23] what am i saying brothers and sisters
[1:39:24] i'm not saying
[1:39:27] you are
[1:39:28] unbelievers
[1:39:29] i'm saying there's a need for us to do
[1:39:32] our checks and balances all the time
[1:39:35] continuously why because the bible says
[1:39:38] the pastor read it last week on sunday
[1:39:40] he said um
[1:39:43] those that
[1:39:45] what does it say hebrews those that
[1:39:47] fervently seek him what does it say who
[1:39:50] knows the scripture
[1:39:53] um
[1:39:55] i want to talk about the one that says
[1:39:56] those that are do up to the end
[1:39:59] those that um
[1:40:00] um
[1:40:02] who is my bible readers those that are
[1:40:05] uh
[1:40:06] uh you see the same shall be saved those
[1:40:10] ones do you want us to read it the same
[1:40:12] shall be saved but it is those that that
[1:40:15] that endure
[1:40:17] that's the way
[1:40:18] to the end
[1:40:21] that's the way i'm looking for
[1:40:23] thank you sister norway those that
[1:40:25] endure
[1:40:26] and that endurance is not something i
[1:40:29] give myself and i say i can make it man
[1:40:32] no no the lord
[1:40:33] comes and pours himself in you and you
[1:40:36] endure until the very end the same shall
[1:40:39] be saved your salvation is not going to
[1:40:42] come at the end it's already given
[1:40:44] you're going to be all what is happening
[1:40:46] at the end is just a manifestation of
[1:40:47] the beginning
[1:40:49] done done deal finished we are in that's
[1:40:52] us
[1:40:53] when we finish working we say that's us
[1:40:55] we are done and we go home
[1:40:58] when we get to that point after enduring
[1:41:01] we are saved
[1:41:03] we have to enjoy
[1:41:05] now i'm going to jump this one let me
[1:41:08] see right i want to jump the whole of it
[1:41:10] but now
[1:41:13] i'm on the screen yes but i want to read
[1:41:15] for you here this portion here
[1:41:18] jesus said
[1:41:21] these signs shall follow them that
[1:41:22] believe now we are getting down to what
[1:41:25] born again means
[1:41:27] you see
[1:41:29] still
[1:41:30] with tempest still mean arrogant
[1:41:33] somebody says something about you and
[1:41:35] you're right i'm ready to fight
[1:41:37] and then
[1:41:38] born again of the spirit of god
[1:41:43] i cannot be born upon again of the
[1:41:44] spirit of god when i'm like that
[1:41:47] no
[1:41:48] god's spirit don't do like that
[1:41:51] no god's spirit is humble
[1:41:54] meek
[1:41:55] sweet
[1:41:56] long suffering that's god loving kind
[1:42:00] forgiving
[1:42:01] unconditionally forgiving your sister
[1:42:04] before she even ask you
[1:42:07] that's god's spirit oh yes
[1:42:10] the prophet says
[1:42:11] that is a sign that you're born again
[1:42:14] you have to be born again by this holy
[1:42:16] spirit not by some demonstration no
[1:42:20] demonstration will make you born again
[1:42:23] right but when you're born again there's
[1:42:25] demonstration that comes but the
[1:42:28] demonstration cannot you make born
[1:42:30] it cannot be made to be born again
[1:42:32] hallelujah filled a finished work god
[1:42:36] into the
[1:42:38] work a finnish work of god into the
[1:42:40] kingdom amen i know i get noisy but if
[1:42:44] you you felt like it i did
[1:42:47] you'll be noisy too
[1:42:50] you'll be no easy
[1:42:52] if you know the god that is in me the
[1:42:54] prophet told that infidel that you know
[1:42:57] the problem you don't you don't have the
[1:42:58] god that i have
[1:43:00] but if you had the god that i have you
[1:43:02] talk the way i talk
[1:43:04] you see the infidel was upset
[1:43:06] now let's let's look at that quickly in
[1:43:08] closing we know that process am i right
[1:43:11] brothers and sisters
[1:43:13] justification
[1:43:14] sanctification and a baptism of the holy
[1:43:17] spirit all those are good
[1:43:20] but let's start here
[1:43:22] you are not sealed by sanctification
[1:43:25] the prophet says you are not sealed by
[1:43:27] certification you are you are sealed by
[1:43:29] the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:43:33] a ceiling is a completing of the work
[1:43:36] that's the reason it couldn't be sealed
[1:43:38] under luda wesley either one it has to
[1:43:41] come to the baptism before the church
[1:43:44] was sealed away till the day of
[1:43:46] redemption you see
[1:43:49] it's now it is this time
[1:43:51] that is why we call this time a very
[1:43:54] blessed time because it is at the end of
[1:43:57] the end and you are placed there
[1:43:59] what confidence did god have in you of
[1:44:01] course he did have of course he knows
[1:44:03] that you must be at the end of the lap
[1:44:05] he knows that and he's got full
[1:44:07] confidence that what he's put in you
[1:44:09] from the beginning even you may not see
[1:44:12] it you may not be aware but it's there
[1:44:14] he put it that's why he made you to live
[1:44:16] now
[1:44:17] otherwise god wouldn't wouldn't bring
[1:44:19] you here he would have made you to live
[1:44:20] in the dark ages
[1:44:23] but god said ah i'm taking the best of
[1:44:25] the best amen hey gabriel what do you
[1:44:28] think i don't even have to consult you
[1:44:29] gabriel i know i'm taking the best of my
[1:44:32] best team to the seventh church age of
[1:44:35] laodicea
[1:44:36] and according to my records they are
[1:44:38] going to make it exceptionally some of
[1:44:41] them are going to get 101 percent
[1:44:45] you
[1:44:46] so all i'm trying to say to you is that
[1:44:48] hey if you are still there by 83 you the
[1:44:52] lord saw you 801 percent
[1:44:55] pass
[1:44:56] you
[1:44:58] got some time to conscientize you
[1:45:01] you know when someone loses conscious we
[1:45:03] bring we conscientize them we do all
[1:45:05] sorts of things
[1:45:07] hey
[1:45:08] cpr we kick them you say that that will
[1:45:10] hurt that person man no we are
[1:45:12] resuscitating
[1:45:15] we are not hating him
[1:45:17] we do all sorts of things wake up you
[1:45:18] can't die now
[1:45:21] you see so we are trying to
[1:45:24] shake those are still at 83 percent
[1:45:27] thinking that they've got a distinction
[1:45:28] no the distinction in the lord is
[1:45:31] hundred percent amen
[1:45:33] now
[1:45:34] this is otherwise
[1:45:35] we are risking that
[1:45:37] that's what we are risking
[1:45:39] we are risking to be sealed by the devil
[1:45:42] and the devil doesn't see you in he
[1:45:43] seals you out
[1:45:46] you see that's the problem that we are
[1:45:48] there's a risk if we cannot take it so
[1:45:51] seriously this issue
[1:45:53] give me 10 more minutes then we are done
[1:45:55] you agree with me
[1:45:57] i see you're all awake and i'm proud of
[1:45:59] you
[1:45:59] but
[1:46:00] let's just read that carefully you see
[1:46:04] now to reject the truth
[1:46:06] when is presented then your ears are
[1:46:10] sealed which is not this year's
[1:46:14] spiritual years
[1:46:16] and you don't hear no more
[1:46:18] and you think you see but you can't see
[1:46:19] no more
[1:46:21] that's the risk
[1:46:23] and and you know the painful truth is
[1:46:26] that once you get still like that
[1:46:28] the painful truth
[1:46:29] is that
[1:46:32] you are not his in the first place
[1:46:37] and that's not you
[1:46:38] i'm not suggesting that's you all i'm
[1:46:40] saying is that
[1:46:41] we are fighting such a crucial battle
[1:46:44] worse than the one for russia in ukraine
[1:46:46] west that's a serious battle we can't
[1:46:49] afford there's no second option in this
[1:46:52] battle
[1:46:53] we have to be away every time missile
[1:46:55] ready to shoot any day any minute
[1:46:59] from all angles
[1:47:01] to shoot because we are protecting
[1:47:03] something so important
[1:47:06] nothing should stop us from going to
[1:47:08] heaven nothing and we shouldn't presume
[1:47:11] that we are going no be sure
[1:47:14] be very sure
[1:47:16] that our salvation that our lives that
[1:47:19] every check and balance is done
[1:47:22] be ready to self-critique yourself
[1:47:25] and be aware when the devil is accusing
[1:47:27] you and when you are looking and
[1:47:29] evaluating yourself don't allow the
[1:47:31] devil to to accuse you no bring the
[1:47:33] weight that's why the holy spirit him he
[1:47:36] will help you to say yes he'll talk to
[1:47:38] you and you are aware ready to listen
[1:47:41] and to say yes the way i spoke to
[1:47:43] brother and you was not right
[1:47:45] call my brother sorry brother andy i'm
[1:47:47] condemned as i'm sitting here i can't
[1:47:49] sleep i think i feel i didn't talk to
[1:47:51] you properly my brother would you
[1:47:53] forgive me
[1:47:56] but we don't you don't find that
[1:47:57] nowadays
[1:47:59] which holy spirit is leading us you
[1:48:01] don't find that
[1:48:03] you don't you know
[1:48:04] not even to apologize just the
[1:48:06] condemnation alone when it comes so
[1:48:09] suppressed we don't we don't we don't
[1:48:11] want to feel it we don't feel it anymore
[1:48:13] have we been bored on our ears or not
[1:48:15] let's be careful
[1:48:17] let's be careful because if he is the
[1:48:20] potter we are the clay which means he
[1:48:22] can mold us
[1:48:25] huh we can mold us
[1:48:28] we know that it's not about me
[1:48:30] personally it's the body
[1:48:32] are we together
[1:48:34] now to reject the truth is not living
[1:48:36] the word of god is is to reject the
[1:48:39] truth is to not leave the full word of
[1:48:42] god when you don't live the full word of
[1:48:44] god
[1:48:46] you are rejecting the truth
[1:48:48] right
[1:48:50] refusing to die to yourself
[1:48:53] right not bearing the fruits the least
[1:48:55] can go on and on and on and on but the
[1:48:57] point i'm trying to say is that all
[1:48:58] those things just demonstrate where you
[1:49:00] are at
[1:49:02] and
[1:49:02] the spirit of god the light that is
[1:49:04] still flicking in your heart
[1:49:06] actually is still a hope for you and for
[1:49:09] me
[1:49:10] it's a blessing
[1:49:11] to be criticized by the lord
[1:49:13] towards righteousness it's a blessing i
[1:49:16] say thank you lord thank you for
[1:49:17] thinking of me my lord my savior for
[1:49:20] showing me where i'm as correct
[1:49:23] must never be bound by culture of not
[1:49:26] wanting to be corrected of just wanting
[1:49:28] to be an introvert who don't who just
[1:49:30] want to
[1:49:31] without saying i am glad or god bless
[1:49:33] you just
[1:49:35] no no no no no no
[1:49:37] children of god are expressive
[1:49:40] and we are noisy
[1:49:43] of course not all of us but
[1:49:45] the point i want to show you is that
[1:49:47] there's two spirits why i'm bringing
[1:49:48] that seal of the devil is that there are
[1:49:50] two spirits
[1:49:52] which has been operating from day one
[1:49:56] kind and evil
[1:49:58] jacob iso
[1:49:59] they've been like that up to today
[1:50:02] the bright denomination huh they are
[1:50:05] there he wants to stifle the able today
[1:50:09] who that to the cane of today
[1:50:12] that's what he wants to do
[1:50:14] right i won't read through that hole but
[1:50:16] the one all i'll read for you there is
[1:50:18] that if you can see what where i'm
[1:50:20] reading
[1:50:21] in the middle there
[1:50:22] now they are going to to be so much like
[1:50:25] alike those two spirits
[1:50:27] the the spirit
[1:50:29] of cain is a religious one
[1:50:32] now some people say well communism is
[1:50:34] the mug of the beast you are wrong
[1:50:36] communism is not the mark of the beast
[1:50:40] yet it is
[1:50:42] you
[1:50:42] can you get that
[1:50:45] the prophet says communism is not the
[1:50:47] mark of the beast yet it is
[1:50:50] but it is heading up
[1:50:53] the the mark of the beast the marco is a
[1:50:56] religious nature very religious so
[1:50:59] cunning sly until it will deceive the
[1:51:02] very elected if it was possible
[1:51:04] just so close till it will deceive the
[1:51:07] elected if it was possible so close
[1:51:12] that's the two spirits so we need to be
[1:51:14] very careful that like like we preach
[1:51:16] the last time the message of religious
[1:51:18] spirit that we are not just under a
[1:51:20] religious spirit in the message
[1:51:23] that there is a lie behind the name in
[1:51:25] my daily life
[1:51:29] same with judas and jesus
[1:51:32] so we'll jump that one
[1:51:34] and go to this one because i requested
[1:51:37] only 10 minutes
[1:51:38] so that means from here
[1:51:40] it's just a
[1:51:43] few slides
[1:51:45] then then then we go home
[1:51:49] uh
[1:51:50] right we're reading that one that says
[1:51:52] from from also the seal of god the seal
[1:51:54] of the christ
[1:51:56] oh i hope you see it brother and his
[1:51:58] work of the holy spirit revealing to the
[1:52:00] individual not upon some emotion
[1:52:04] not upon something you should do or
[1:52:06] shouldn't do or this or that or other or
[1:52:09] the other
[1:52:10] all those things are all right emotions
[1:52:14] and things are alright
[1:52:16] but they are just a cat
[1:52:18] the horse is the holy spirit
[1:52:21] you see emotions we are emotional people
[1:52:25] yes
[1:52:26] but our emotions don't supersede
[1:52:28] the holy spirit
[1:52:32] all those things are all right
[1:52:33] but the first thing it has to be a
[1:52:36] supernatural revelation of god that give
[1:52:40] the individual that jesus christ is the
[1:52:42] son of god calling that's right without
[1:52:45] that brother you are only impersonating
[1:52:49] only pretending amen
[1:52:52] that's what the man of god says there
[1:52:54] so
[1:52:55] excitement and happiness it must be the
[1:52:57] one done by the spirit
[1:53:00] all the gifts everything
[1:53:03] comes after that
[1:53:05] they are under the control of the
[1:53:07] control tower which is the holy spirit
[1:53:09] the real seal
[1:53:11] right let's read the next one you are
[1:53:12] separated people when you come to god a
[1:53:15] royal priesthood is you you are it's not
[1:53:18] you may you will be if you do that no no
[1:53:20] no you are
[1:53:21] now all what you are trying to do is
[1:53:23] that we are just getting this fruit to
[1:53:25] his ripened stage
[1:53:27] are we together
[1:53:29] let's jump to the next one otherwise my
[1:53:32] time is finished
[1:53:33] um i will read brother almond oh yeah
[1:53:36] that's two slides that are the same okay
[1:53:38] that's all good
[1:53:40] now
[1:53:40] the prophet here is talking about
[1:53:43] by the time titus was besieging israel
[1:53:46] he was surrounding the walls of
[1:53:47] jerusalem going to destroy them
[1:53:50] right he says otherwise before the great
[1:53:52] destruction of 1896 titans seeking the
[1:53:55] house of jerusalem this the city the
[1:53:58] holy spirit went forth first before
[1:54:00] titus
[1:54:02] you find it in the book of ezekiel
[1:54:05] where it was prophet prophesied when the
[1:54:07] prophet of god was in babylon and he
[1:54:09] spoke about that time
[1:54:12] 600 and something years before it
[1:54:14] happened
[1:54:15] right he said the man dressed in white
[1:54:18] with the markers a pencil
[1:54:20] on his side to put upon a mark upon men
[1:54:24] who sighed and cried for the
[1:54:26] abominations that was done in the city
[1:54:29] there are people who are crying and
[1:54:31] praying
[1:54:33] for the abomination of the city amen
[1:54:36] those are the ones who got the seals
[1:54:38] and when the seal upon them
[1:54:40] now those ones the angels went out the
[1:54:43] holy spirit is out today to mark them to
[1:54:46] seal them still still still sit sit sit
[1:54:50] he's busy
[1:54:51] stealing them he's at work
[1:54:53] since still see right
[1:54:56] because they've got
[1:54:58] the presence of god in their lives he's
[1:54:59] still in them now once they're sealed

[1:56:18] and baptizing face forward big words all
[1:56:20] that and all these other little form of
[1:56:22] isms and get down to the real concrete
[1:56:25] broken spirit where sin is
[1:56:28] mix that together and start the old
[1:56:30] fashioned crying out
[1:56:33] of a newborn child
[1:56:35] that's the kind that gets the holy ghost
[1:56:38] that's the kind of the people that gets
[1:56:40] a seal those ones
[1:56:43] no matter whether they are methodist
[1:56:46] baptist catholics or whatever they are
[1:56:48] when they get before the altar and cry
[1:56:51] day and night
[1:56:54] oh lord look at the sins of this city my
[1:56:57] heart has had
[1:56:59] my heart can't rest i can't rest lord
[1:57:01] and i see these things going on oh god
[1:57:04] do something send us an old fashioned
[1:57:06] revival you are on the borderline of
[1:57:09] getting the holy ghost my brother
[1:57:12] when you do that yes sir
[1:57:14] you're on the border
[1:57:15] you're just getting it and once you get
[1:57:17] it let me tell you the news once you get
[1:57:19] it can i tell you
[1:57:22] you are gone
[1:57:23] you are gone

[1:57:28] reverse that there will be no more
[1:57:30] reverse game you are in you are in
[1:57:32] after that interview whatever you are
[1:57:35] never shaking the moment you hear the
[1:57:38] call they say mr bondo
[1:57:40] i'm sorry so from such a company i'm
[1:57:43] telling you that you are successful what
[1:57:45] do you do
[1:57:46] the rapture has taken you
[1:57:49] is history the rest
[1:57:55] so that's what we are striving for
[1:57:56] brothers and sisters not all these isms
[1:57:59] the prophet says not all these things
[1:58:01] around us yes let them exist
[1:58:04] they are here for the purpose but they
[1:58:06] cannot deviate my attention
[1:58:09] they cannot deviate my attention my
[1:58:10] focus
[1:58:12] is that one
[1:58:14] think about christ
[1:58:16] for
[1:58:17] telling of christ coming in isaiah
[1:58:19] chapter nine think about it
[1:58:21] when isaiah said for unto us a child is
[1:58:23] born unto us a son is given and the
[1:58:27] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:58:29] why i'm reading this scripture
[1:58:31] why there was no sun at that time
[1:58:34] there was no sun that was born
[1:58:37] but he was there
[1:58:39] you see god
[1:58:41] you see the prophet when he was seeing
[1:58:42] the visions and he was seeing them in
[1:58:45] present tense
[1:58:47] god is an ever present tense god he's
[1:58:49] not a yesterday he the same one of
[1:58:52] yesterday he's the same one today he's
[1:58:54] got no past tense
[1:58:56] you see when you get into the dimension
[1:58:58] of that realm
[1:59:00] the real you you see things as they are
[1:59:04] when the child is going to be born 500
[1:59:06] years ago i mean to god to come you see
[1:59:09] the cvs now
[1:59:11] you see when you see something that
[1:59:13] happened that time during the olden days
[1:59:15] of the apostles you see it as now amen
[1:59:19] you see that's why the prophet saw adam
[1:59:21] and eve he said he says no i can see
[1:59:23] them they are working god gave them
[1:59:25] god put some skin is working power
[1:59:28] on their feet their blood is dripping i
[1:59:30] can see them oh he sees them in a
[1:59:34] different realm
[1:59:35] i pray that you seeing yourself in a
[1:59:37] different realm this morning reptilian
[1:59:41] going through the gloves you see ah i've
[1:59:43] never experienced this
[1:59:45] what a happiness what an excitement
[1:59:48] the reason i'm reading in that scripture
[1:59:50] of isaiah 9 is because in ephesians also
[1:59:53] he says that he might present himself a
[1:59:56] glorious church having no spot no
[1:59:59] wrangle not it may happen
[2:00:02] it has happened at the time he saw the
[2:00:04] church the bride
[2:00:06] he saw him
[2:00:07] christ was sin you were seen
[2:00:10] you are sin perfect and ready
[2:00:14] and that's what we're striving for
[2:00:16] that's what we want to get towards
[2:00:18] that's what we are getting towards
[2:00:20] now
[2:00:21] that he might present himself a glorious
[2:00:23] church not having spot or wrangle or any
[2:00:26] such thing but that he should
[2:00:29] be holy and without blemish
[2:00:33] no blemish
[2:00:34] on his bride and that is you
[2:00:37] for this cause a man shall leave his
[2:00:39] wife and mother
[2:00:41] i mean that shall leave his father and
[2:00:43] mother i'm sorry his father and mother
[2:00:45] is he that is why the lord left heaven
[2:00:48] he left heaven
[2:00:50] to come here
[2:00:51] for his for his for his bride he left
[2:00:53] everything
[2:00:55] and come here to die
[2:00:57] because it's a serious business
[2:00:59] transaction this one
[2:01:01] no money can afford it in conclusion
[2:01:06] you have been chosen
[2:01:09] so
[2:01:10] let's live up to the choosing
[2:01:13] because you have been chosen
[2:01:15] not that movie of the chosen
[2:01:18] you have been chosen
[2:01:23] you know when you get chosen neither
[2:01:26] sorry my girl when you get chosen
[2:01:29] you know you think deep that this man
[2:01:32] out of
[2:01:33] billions of girls
[2:01:36] on earth
[2:01:37] at his disposal and he chooses me
[2:01:40] what kind of choosing is this one
[2:01:42] listen
[2:01:45] you are chosen
[2:01:48] i'm not telling you a fable you are
[2:01:50] chosen and you must live up to the
[2:01:53] choosing
[2:01:55] it was a costly choosing
[2:01:58] all we are trying to do is to preach as
[2:02:01] you as you should as we should he time
[2:02:05] of to have a time of remembrance to
[2:02:07] bring us to the remembrance of actually
[2:02:10] who we are
[2:02:12] the recollection of who you are
[2:02:15] right to reignite the fire
[2:02:19] in us by preaching the weight
[2:02:24] hallelujah
[2:02:25] i trust that you have been following me
[2:02:27] and i trust that you caught the thought
[2:02:30] of the ceiling away
[2:02:34] we have to be sealed away brothers and
[2:02:36] sisters
[2:02:37] and there's no further way to explain it
[2:02:40] without that ceiling without that seal
[2:02:43] there's no rapture there's no going home
[2:02:46] and we have to make sure
[2:02:48] we don't doubt that we are chosen we
[2:02:50] don't doubt but we have to make sure
[2:02:51] that we shall be very sure be very very
