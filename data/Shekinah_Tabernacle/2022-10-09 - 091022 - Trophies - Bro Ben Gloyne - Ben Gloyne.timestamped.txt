[41:25] David ran and stood upon the Philistine
[41:27] this is Goliath and took a sword and
[41:29] Drew it out of the sheath thereof and
[41:31] slew him and cut off his head their
[41:33] worth and when the Philistine saw their
[41:35] Champion was dead they fled and the men
[41:37] of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted
[41:40] and pursued the Philistines until they
[41:42] came to the valley and to the gates of
[41:43] ekron and the wound of the Philistines
[41:45] fell by the way of uh shaharian even
[41:48] under gath and unto ikron and the
[41:51] children of Israel returned from chasing
[41:52] after the Philistines and they and they
[41:54] spoiled their tents yeah and David took
[41:57] the head of the Philistine and brought
[41:58] it to Jerusalem but he put his armor in
[42:00] his tent praise the Lord amen word of

[42:19] but songs of Deliverance floor we trust

[43:08] and Lord those who are not here today
[43:09] maybe they're sick or traveling Lord may
[43:11] be their portion father we love you
[43:13] we're so thankful that you first loved
[43:15] us Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen
[43:19] God bless you may have your seats this
[43:20] morning so I want to speak about
[43:22] trophies David got one one one big
[43:25] trophy right there amen
[43:29] what do I love about trophies is
[43:30] trophies uh declare something's been won
[43:33] or something's been got a trophy is a um
[43:36] uh uh the uh Mr Google would tell me
[43:39] that there's a couple of meanings of it
[43:41] but it's a souvenir of an achievement
[43:43] especially say a part of an animal
[43:45] that's been taken when hunting now when
[43:47] you think about real Hunters now I can't
[43:49] put myself in that bracket but I'm sure
[43:51] most hunters who are Hunters don't just
[43:53] go wandering out into the bush you
[43:54] Brothers can play say amen and just say
[43:56] well we're gonna go shoot whatever we
[43:58] can shoot and hopefully it's not just
[43:59] the breeze but they're after a specific
[44:01] Target right so so a real Hunter will
[44:03] say I want to get a price stack so I'll
[44:05] go after a price stack or maybe they
[44:07] want you know meat so go after a young
[44:08] dough or a buck yep maybe yep I might
[44:10] cut in this right right way but you know
[44:13] they'll go after something they're after
[44:14] right they're not just going and they
[44:16] see us you know you know they they they
[44:18] go after a deer and they just shoot a
[44:20] goat no they want a deer right that's
[44:21] that that's what they want okay because
[44:24] they're oh if they want to go they get a
[44:25] goat but a hunter will go after a
[44:27] specific Trophy and we'll get that amen
[44:30] so now it's the same thing with our lord
[44:32] Jesus when he stepped down into this
[44:33] Earth he was after trophies now I was I
[44:36] was sharing this with Christine last
[44:38] night and she says you're not trying to
[44:39] say we're glass head are we and I said
[44:41] no because there's multiple just
[44:42] multiple parts of this trophy because
[44:44] our Lord has won trophies over the enemy
[44:47] right he is he has gathered trophies
[44:49] from the devil that the devil could
[44:51] never replace but then also we are God's
[44:53] trophies as well we are his jewels that
[44:56] he'll sit in a in a crown so what I love
[44:59] about testimonies is testimonies don't
[45:01] start off as a glory but they start off
[45:03] as a shame where because before the
[45:05] testimony comes it's a shame upon a
[45:07] person where like you look at Goliath
[45:09] for example he was ashamed to Israel
[45:11] here was one man defying their whole
[45:13] Army defying their whole nation that
[45:16] Nation had God behind them it wasn't
[45:17] just any other nation that a god of
[45:19] stone or wood or some nice idea but it
[45:21] was the Living God that was their God
[45:23] and and But but so so they had they were
[45:26] serving an Unstoppable God but nothing
[45:28] could stop stop him the devil cannot
[45:30] stop him he couldn't stop him back there
[45:32] he won't stop him today and if they were
[45:34] serving an Unstoppable God they were
[45:36] Unstoppable but yet here was a man who
[45:38] was stoppable stopping the Unstoppable
[45:42] that was a shame to them Goliath was
[45:45] ashamed because here they were both
[45:47] Moses and Joshua said one will chase a
[45:50] thousand one will chase a thousand so
[45:52] you think about that now it never says
[45:54] so we'll just read Joshua 23 and 10. one
[45:57] man of you shall chase a thousand for
[45:58] the Lord your God he is that Fighter for
[46:01] you as he has promised you so in that
[46:03] verse is nowhere about how big the
[46:05] Thousand will be in terms of stature it
[46:07] didn't say it would be a thousand
[46:08] midgets or a thousand cripples no or a
[46:11] thousand Giants it doesn't matter as one
[46:13] will chase a thousand so it didn't
[46:15] matter how big the enemy was one man
[46:17] would chase a thousand so in other words
[46:19] one man could not a thousand men could
[46:22] not stop one man now here was the whole
[46:24] Army of thousands so really in reality
[46:26] they far outnumbered all of the
[46:28] Philistines and our God is so
[46:30] Unstoppable that David on the
[46:31] inspiration said I'm going to kill you
[46:33] Goliath I'm going to and I'm going to
[46:34] kill all the Army right here if he had
[46:36] to do a single-handedly he would have
[46:37] done it yeah right but here was the
[46:39] Unstoppable being stopped by the
[46:41] stoppable and that was a shame that was
[46:44] a shame to to Israel and it's the same
[46:48] thing with something before it becomes a
[46:49] testimony it's a shame to that person
[46:52] you know when someone's not free it's a
[46:54] shame that that living below their
[46:56] privilege Israel was living well below
[46:58] their privilege by being out in tents
[47:00] for 40 days when they could have just
[47:02] killed him and moved on and won the
[47:03] victory you know on day one so if
[47:05] someone's not free it's a shame to that
[47:07] person but when they're willing to call
[47:09] upon the Lord and surrender their lives
[47:11] then he comes and defeats that enemy and
[47:13] then it becomes a victory and it becomes
[47:16] a glory or a testimony see someone who's
[47:18] really free of something they're not
[47:20] afraid to testify they are delivered of
[47:22] it because they're free of it but
[47:23] they're still under the bondage of that
[47:24] spirit all right they're they're ashamed
[47:27] about it because they're not actually
[47:28] free they may say they're free but
[47:29] they're not actually free so someone who
[47:31] is under the bondage of Allah spirit is
[47:33] not ashamed to say I was freed of a lost
[47:35] spirit because it becomes a trophy it
[47:36] becomes a testimony right or Pride or
[47:39] something like that someone who hides
[47:40] behind Pride well it's a shame but then
[47:43] when they get free to that Pride Spirit
[47:45] they meet the Lord it becomes the glory
[47:46] it becomes the testimony I mean to hear
[47:49] Thy word thou living under the shame but
[47:51] then one man stepped forth and say who
[47:52] is this uncircumcised fallacy that would
[47:55] defy the armies of the Living God and
[47:57] then he prophesied to to Goliath I know
[47:59] you know the story but he prophesied to
[48:01] Goliath his end and and the first
[48:03] Prophecy of the defeat of the devil was
[48:06] given in the Garden of Eden where where
[48:08] God told the devil said the seed of the
[48:11] woman is going to crush or bruise the
[48:12] head of the seed of The Serpent and so
[48:14] it was prophesied of his Doom there and
[48:17] then it was manifested that day on
[48:18] Calvary of his defeat and then he's
[48:21] going to burn in the Lake of Fire so the
[48:22] first father prophecies being fulfilled
[48:24] the second part's on its way amen so
[48:26] here was David now he takes a sword of
[48:29] Goliath he chops off Goliath's head and
[48:31] he raises up that Trophy and so now here
[48:34] is now notice here is the strongest
[48:36] devil in the whole Army it wasn't a
[48:38] weakling Philistine that fought David it
[48:40] was the champion it was the champion of
[48:42] champions Goliath of gath and he raised
[48:44] up his head as a trophy and then all of
[48:46] us draw rally tight now if a Shepherd
[48:48] boy can take a giant down how many can I
[48:50] take out and at rally them it gave them
[48:53] faith and they pursued and we read and
[48:55] they and they conquered their foes now
[48:57] what I love about God is he wants to
[48:59] realize the victories he's won you can
[49:01] win the same victories so the Mighty Men
[49:03] when they came to their position under
[49:04] the anointing of the hour saying that
[49:06] David would come into power they
[49:07] realized so if the same anointing that
[49:09] was upon him that allowed him to kill
[49:10] goliaths upon me we can take these
[49:12] Giants down too I mean slave riffs
[49:15] lifted up some trophies as well Aaliyah
[49:18] said now here's our lord Jesus I'm just
[49:19] gonna jump a few thousand years after
[49:20] that event and now here he is he's
[49:22] hanging on Calvary the devil thinks he's
[49:24] got him but the devil's about to face
[49:26] the greatest defeat he will ever be
[49:28] defeated with and he cannot get back
[49:30] what he's about to lose so the so the
[49:33] Stinger of you know that bee of death is
[49:35] buzzing around our lord Jesus and he
[49:37] stung many a man he stung Mighty
[49:39] prophets man Mighty woman of God down
[49:41] Through the Ages and it's and it's and
[49:43] and the sting has got in and it's come
[49:45] out and so no doubt the devil thinks
[49:46] he's he's just a man like any other man
[49:48] sure he's done Mighty Miracles he's cast
[49:50] metal out of a lot of people he's caused
[49:52] me a lot of trouble and you know but but
[49:54] he's just like any other man because if
[49:56] he was God he wouldn't be strip naked
[49:59] Scourge beaten hang on a cross as an
[50:01] open shame in front of the people but so
[50:03] he couldn't quite work out who he was
[50:05] but now here comes the Stinger of death
[50:06] and then our lord Jesus says it is
[50:09] finished
[50:09] and then and then he goes to sink his
[50:11] stinger in but then but then an unseen
[50:14] hand grabs that stinger and says this is
[50:16] mine he tries to pull it back up it just
[50:19] rips out of his body and you know it be
[50:21] when it loses Stinger it's on his death
[50:23] run right it's it's it it's it's life is
[50:26] going out of it's the same thing with
[50:27] the devil when he was conquered that
[50:29] down Calvary his life is going to leave
[50:31] him right so now he doesn't have a
[50:33] stinger really is is a big buzz
[50:35] and so now but now the thing is when our
[50:38] Lord gathers trophies he loves his
[50:40] trophies off
[50:43] looking all the way from that Valley to
[50:45] Jerusalem carrying glass head
[50:48] Hallelujah Maybe This Time got a bit
[50:50] tired he'd raise it with this arm but he
[50:52] want everyone to see all of Israel to
[50:54] see look who God has delivered into my
[50:57] hands he's a conquered Foe and the Lord
[50:59] Jesus the same way he's got that singer
[51:01] of death he didn't leave it there he's
[51:03] still packing it around and he steps in
[51:05] among his church and raises it up see
[51:08] our conquered hell death in the grave I
[51:09] have the keys of hell and death in my
[51:11] possession and he and he walks in our
[51:13] mitts and he raises them up and saying
[51:15] look this is one of conquered and then
[51:17] Faith rises in the people's hearts
[51:18] saying about Champion Concord hell death
[51:21] in the grave what's this Pride what's
[51:23] this what's this trouble losses for
[51:25] setting sin compared to that if he's
[51:27] conquered the head devil and all the
[51:29] ones under him what is this thing facing
[51:31] me Hallelujah and that's what he loves
[51:34] to do that's why I just you know I just
[51:37] so moved thinking about it he walks in
[51:38] our midst and he holds the Stinger up
[51:41] here's my trophy I was coming for this
[51:44] as the purpose I came to the world that
[51:46] I would defeat destroy the Devil
[51:48] Hallelujah and look I've still got it in
[51:50] my possession
[51:51] we can rally children amen I've
[51:54] conquered your greatest foe the thing
[51:55] you feared the most is death but I've
[51:57] conquered death amen to that Stinger
[51:59] that's why that's why the Apostle pulled
[52:01] down the end of his Road they were
[52:03] sharpening that ax saying we're going to
[52:04] cut your head off boy you know you've
[52:06] come to the end but he'd say death where
[52:08] is yours grave where's your stink death
[52:10] where's your Victory but thanks be to
[52:12] God it gives us a victory through Jesus
[52:14] Christ Our Lord yeah they would give out
[52:16] their threatenings and you know maybe
[52:18] that executioner executed a lot of men
[52:20] but Paul was different why is he happy
[52:24] why is he smiling
[52:26] this man must be a crazy man no he got
[52:28] his mind amen he found his mind when he
[52:31] got the mind of Christ he wasn't a crazy
[52:33] man he knew exactly where he was going I
[52:35] mean he was caught up to the third
[52:36] Heavens he knew where he was going it
[52:39] wasn't a surprise when he stepped from
[52:40] this world to the next world where he
[52:42] was going because it was revealed to him
[52:44] it should be the same way with you and I
[52:46] I mean when the Holy Ghost comes into
[52:47] our lives that's actually God saying you
[52:49] are coming with me amen I'm not going to
[52:52] leave you here it's not a hope so that
[52:53] you have a resurrection you have a no-so
[52:56] that's how it should be with you and I
[52:58] shouldn't it should be such an assurance
[53:00] in my heart it doesn't matter if I go by
[53:02] the way the Graver by the way the
[53:03] Rapture I'm going
[53:05] I'm not going down I'm going up I'm
[53:07] ascending a fear saying that I'm
[53:09] ascending as well Hallelujah so trophies
[53:12] are a great thing
[53:13] amen our Lord has a lot of trophies now
[53:16] when we when he gives us testimonies he
[53:18] gives us trophies of his grace and we're
[53:21] going to realize like David it wasn't
[53:22] David that killed Goliath that was God
[53:24] and David that killed Goliath right just
[53:26] like he gave him the lion and the bear
[53:27] that's why he said to Saul well God gave
[53:30] me a line and a beer into my hand he'll
[53:32] do the same thing with Goliath he didn't
[53:33] say well I killed the lion and I killed
[53:35] the bear no God God gave them to me so
[53:37] when he gives you testimony she doesn't
[53:39] want you to put them in the cupboard or
[53:41] under the stairs he wants you to show
[53:42] off your trophies I mean God delivered
[53:45] me of many things many troubles many
[53:47] hardships and you can raise those
[53:49] trophies up and say God's grace is
[53:51] sufficient God's grace is more than
[53:53] enough they'll be delivering me of this
[53:55] he'll deliver you he's still the same
[53:56] God today and we can take those trophies
[53:59] and say Lord you won great trophies in
[54:01] my life
[54:02] Hallelujah and it goes from a shame and
[54:04] to a glory
[54:06] why is the glory of God on the people is
[54:08] trophies that he's won US amen
[54:11] it's my helper I shall not fear I
[54:14] ra he'll lead me through yo by Green
[54:16] Pastures besides Still Waters we don't
[54:18] need to fear
[54:20] Hallelujah why because he gives us Glory
[54:22] the devil wants it to be a shame but no
[54:25] it becomes a great glory in our lives
[54:27] amen when we rarely meet God I say we
[54:29] can really meet God
[54:31] he really gives us trophies that's not
[54:32] just a different way of thinking it's a
[54:34] reality I mean things once plagued Our
[54:36] Lives maybe plagued Our Generations of
[54:38] family but it stops in your life
[54:40] although you can lift up that Trophy and
[54:42] say no God break Cycles he breaks pain
[54:45] he breaks hurt amen he breaks
[54:46] indifference or stubborn spiritual
[54:48] whatever maybe he breaks all those
[54:50] things and he wants because he wants you
[54:52] because he rejoices when we get a
[54:54] victory he rejoices when the devil's
[54:57] defeated in our lives he gets excited
[54:59] they're just like me amen they're made
[55:02] of the same stuff hallelujah amen I
[55:04] conquered so they conquered Hallelujah
[55:06] you know you see your kids they win
[55:08] something they win a race or they get
[55:10] some prize at school you're proud of
[55:11] them aren't you yeah they bring a
[55:13] certificate home for certain things like
[55:14] praise God I'm so proud of you honey
[55:17] that's awesome same thing with the Lord
[55:18] you know we said Lord you won this
[55:20] battle in our lives and he gets so proud
[55:22] of you he's like that's my children my
[55:24] blood works there will see
[55:29] trying to recover and he gets a phone
[55:31] call from God see I'll put you on video
[55:33] and look at that yeah see he's still
[55:35] packing it you can't get it back
[55:37] hey man it's the same thing with the
[55:39] trophies that God has you know there are
[55:41] some trophies you know
[55:43] in the natural
[55:45] and the natural see a trophy um you know
[55:47] especially in ancient Greece or Rome was
[55:49] weapons of a defeated enemy set up as a
[55:52] memorial of Victory all right I mean now
[55:54] with natural armies you lose some armies
[55:57] you lose some weapons you can replace
[55:58] them you can reforge swords you can make
[56:01] armor you can you know even now no doubt
[56:03] Russia's building tanks and there you
[56:05] know they're replenishing everything
[56:06] they've lost but when it comes to God
[56:08] and the devil the devil cannot replace
[56:10] conquered weapons but he can't they
[56:13] become a look they become a memorial or
[56:15] a trophy but he can't get them back so
[56:18] he can't grow another stinger
[56:19] right he cannot grow another Stinger he
[56:22] cannot stop the Holy Ghost flowing among
[56:24] the people he cannot just bring
[56:26] Superstition in and conquer the people
[56:28] no more because his schemes have been
[56:30] exposed in this end time where the
[56:32] fullness of God has been poured out and
[56:34] we know he lives so we won't settle for
[56:36] anything less just like David he's
[56:38] carrying Goliath's head he's like we
[56:40] won't set off anything less as well
[56:41] we're going to conquer the whole land
[56:43] we're not going to settle for being
[56:45] under bondage no more and I believe it
[56:47] would be the same with all the judges
[56:48] when they when God arose in their lives
[56:50] and they conquer the enemy but we're not
[56:52] going back to bondage no more it was the
[56:54] Next Generation that forgot God that
[56:55] went down into slavery but those who
[56:57] knew the power of God saying we are not
[56:59] going to be slaves no more we have
[57:01] trophies to prove he's alive
[57:03] announcements Hallelujah and it's the
[57:06] same thing I trust with you and I we
[57:08] ain't going back and don't believe no
[57:10] more we haven't gone into Superstition
[57:11] we're not letting something that's
[57:13] stoppable stop the Unstoppable I mean so
[57:16] don't let something stop you when you
[57:18] are meant to be unstoppable
[57:20] hallelujah hallelujah amen we have
[57:23] Memorials of victory
[57:25] but they're living Memorial
[57:27] I mean they're not some dead piece of
[57:29] slab somewhere with a plaque you know
[57:31] this day whatever this happened no it's
[57:33] a living Memorial
[57:34] amen that's why the apostles and the
[57:37] other 120 the upper Emperors shout and
[57:39] rejoice right I mean because the one who
[57:41] had the Stinger stepped into the
[57:42] building
[57:44] yeah stepped into the building and then
[57:46] just wave it in front of him he stepped
[57:48] into them
[57:52] but in them that's the same thing with
[57:54] you and I the same Victory that's why
[57:55] the book of Acts is still being written
[57:57] amen those Believers in that they were
[58:00] victorious the enemy came against them
[58:03] but they realized hey if my God
[58:04] conquered hell death in the grave what
[58:06] can man do to me what can these Spirits
[58:08] do to me what could nothing they can't
[58:10] do nothing because my God's already
[58:11] conquered them hey man so he now steps
[58:14] into his people and continues to live
[58:16] out
[58:17] the victory
[58:19] Hallelujah but you see you've got to
[58:21] come to a time when you diet to yourself
[58:23] and then you have a
[58:24] Heaven amen where it's where it goes
[58:26] beyond arguments or ideas or culture or
[58:29] upbringing becomes a reality amen where
[58:31] brother man was saying the message
[58:32] Victory Day says we don't need their
[58:34] organizations we don't need their stuff
[58:36] for this world to have
[58:39] we don't have to tell you in the things
[58:40] of the world we've had a v-day a victory
[58:42] day we wrestled out one day or one night
[58:45] oh I remember the wrestle when I had to
[58:47] die out to myself then there came a
[58:49] v-day when I got the victory then God's
[58:52] word became right so if God's word has
[58:54] not become right to you you need a v-day
[58:56] you diet to yourself and let God live
[58:59] hey man say he said the Baptist Church
[59:02] to me is no more than any other
[59:03] organization that's right I had a v-day
[59:04] God's word is right
[59:07] Hallelujah
[59:09] now we understand by Isaiah 14 that the
[59:12] devil has made this world A wilderness
[59:14] yeah he's made it a Wilderness you say
[59:16] well there's more people upon the Earth
[59:18] right now there's more life upon the
[59:19] Earth right now than ever has been in
[59:21] terms of human population and that may
[59:23] well be very true but in terms of life
[59:26] it is a Wilderness I'm not just about
[59:28] natural life not about the life of God
[59:30] where eternal life is blooming it's in
[59:32] very few people today sadly and this
[59:35] world is a Wilderness we know there's
[59:36] catastrophic if time would go on this
[59:38] nature is failing nature is groaning for
[59:40] a for a for a birth you know it's
[59:42] looking for the manifestation of Sons
[59:44] and Daughters of God you know so so
[59:46] Nature's groaning nations are groaning
[59:48] they see that it's only a few minutes
[59:50] till midnight of the Doomsday Clock of
[59:52] nuclear nuclear destruction we
[59:54] understand all these things but the
[59:56] world has been made a Wilderness as he
[59:58] says in Isaiah 14 verse 17 that made the
[1:00:01] world as a Wilderness and destroyed the
[1:00:03] cities thereof that open not the house
[1:00:05] of his prisoners this is this is what
[1:00:07] the devil has done now what I like about
[1:00:10] our God is it doesn't matter how bad the
[1:00:12] world gets it doesn't stop them going
[1:00:14] right to get his trophies now I'm going
[1:00:16] to talk about him Gathering you right so
[1:00:18] so it doesn't stop him Gathering his
[1:00:20] trophies but when he we
[1:00:26] story of the parable in Matthew 18 of
[1:00:29] the of the shepherd where where he says
[1:00:32] now how thank ye he says for the son of
[1:00:35] man has come to save that which is lost
[1:00:37] how thinky if a man have a hundredth
[1:00:39] sheep and one of them has gone astray
[1:00:41] doth he not leave the 199 and goeth into
[1:00:44] the mountains and seeketh that which is
[1:00:46] gone astray and if so be find it very
[1:00:49] Sandy he rejoices more of that sheep
[1:00:51] than of the 90 and nine that went not
[1:00:54] astray even so it's not the will of your
[1:00:56] father which is in heaven that one of
[1:00:58] these little ones should perish so so
[1:01:00] now now now you see the shepherd doesn't
[1:01:02] look at the mountain say the Mountain's
[1:01:04] too high all the all the Glaciers are
[1:01:06] too cold or there's too much bushes or
[1:01:08] other conditions aren't right no a real
[1:01:10] Shepherd will go after that sheep that
[1:01:13] is lost they will not just go get any
[1:01:15] sheep they'll go get a particular sheep
[1:01:16] they're not the one that was on their
[1:01:18] heart or their mind or I'd say on their
[1:01:20] heart that sheep that was on their heart
[1:01:21] they will go get it was like I've said
[1:01:23] it before when I've gone to pick up the
[1:01:25] girls from school yo I don't just go get
[1:01:27] any girl that's it that's their age I
[1:01:29] don't just go oh that one will do that
[1:01:31] one's closer to the car here come home
[1:01:33] you're mine no I got to get them I'm
[1:01:35] going to get them I'm not getting anyone
[1:01:37] else they may look near the same maybe
[1:01:39] was a double gang or whatever it's
[1:01:41] called like a look-alike you know no
[1:01:43] they don't have them there at school but
[1:01:44] you know they're originals but you know
[1:01:45] you know but I'm not gonna go any girl
[1:01:48] from their class I'm getting them right
[1:01:50] and I'm not gonna settle until I get
[1:01:52] them and bring them home see to me
[1:01:54] that's that's the heart of a father is
[1:01:56] he's gonna get his children he's not
[1:01:58] just going to get anyone he's going to
[1:01:59] get the ones that are on us huh amen
[1:02:01] says the same thing with the Sheep a
[1:02:03] real Shepherd here won't just go get in
[1:02:05] your sheep but he wants to get the one
[1:02:07] that that particular one that was on his
[1:02:10] heart on mine before the foundation of
[1:02:11] the world
[1:02:12] now our great Shepherd is not satisfied
[1:02:15] with most of his sheep redeemed most of
[1:02:17] his children he wants them all and he
[1:02:19] has certain people in his heart that he
[1:02:20] knew that he's looking for names that
[1:02:22] are written on the last book of life
[1:02:24] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:02:26] so he is very particular in the ones
[1:02:29] that he's going after aren't you glad he
[1:02:30] came looking for you he came looking for
[1:02:32] me I mean not just anyone even though
[1:02:34] it's too super old let them come but
[1:02:36] he's got names he's got a family album
[1:02:38] he wants to see that album restored
[1:02:41] praise the Lord so our Shepherd stepped
[1:02:43] into the Wilderness of this world to
[1:02:45] find us
[1:02:46] and it didn't matter how big of a
[1:02:48] Wilderness it might have been he's
[1:02:49] determined to find them
[1:02:51] amen he's determined to find you and I
[1:02:54] oh yes it's amazing a sheep is an
[1:02:56] incredibly
[1:02:57] um
[1:02:58] kind of pathetic animals
[1:03:00] they get lost easy they get
[1:03:02] disorientated easy you know they they
[1:03:05] they you know uh they have no kind of
[1:03:08] homing pigeon kind of thing and built in
[1:03:10] them they can get they they get very
[1:03:12] sick very easy they're not very
[1:03:14] strong-willed kind of creatures
[1:03:17] this is this is how God describes us we
[1:03:20] need a Shepherd hey doesn't matter you
[1:03:22] can be the most crippled up sheep in the
[1:03:24] whole herd but if you've got a Shepherd
[1:03:26] if you're next to
[1:03:28] the need to worry right so let the weak
[1:03:30] say I am strong amen so so now
[1:03:34] so sheep can get caught with its wool
[1:03:36] and you know Blackberry or thorns and
[1:03:38] they can struggle away and they can push
[1:03:39] and pull and you know try and free
[1:03:41] themselves but they're hidden out of
[1:03:43] sight it's hard for the shepherd to find
[1:03:45] them but there's nothing like a bleeding
[1:03:47] cry as it goes across the valley right
[1:03:51] so it's the same thing we can be caught
[1:03:52] up in sin maybe in Pride fornication
[1:03:54] something that's you know not drugs or
[1:03:56] whatever it may be we get caught up in
[1:03:58] Prior your popularity whatever it may be
[1:04:00] it's but but to me it's like Blackberry
[1:04:02] it's Thorns you're scoring and you can
[1:04:04] struggle away saying I can manage this
[1:04:06] I'm okay I'm doing fine but you just
[1:04:08] caught in a second and and many times
[1:04:11] we'll try and improve ourselves saying
[1:04:13] we're never going back to that thing
[1:04:14] again and then next minute here we are
[1:04:16] but you see you see it takes the Cry of
[1:04:19] the sheep together to to get the
[1:04:21] shepherd's attention right so they hear
[1:04:23] the bleeding of the sheep you just find
[1:04:25] a Shepherd can't find them maybe if
[1:04:26] they're stuck in a Thicket somewhere but
[1:04:28] when they stop fighting and start
[1:04:30] bleeding that's when the shepherd can
[1:04:33] find them and free them same thing with
[1:04:35] you and I when we just stop fighting and
[1:04:37] start bleeding
[1:04:38] saying father God help me Lord Jesus
[1:04:40] help me I'm quoting this help me Lord
[1:04:42] then if that's when he reaches down his
[1:04:44] hands takes the thorns out get you out
[1:04:47] of that Blackberry put you on your
[1:04:49] shoulders put you on his shoulders
[1:04:51] rather and begins to carry you to the
[1:04:53] Sheepfold and then we become living
[1:04:56] trophies of his grace now it doesn't
[1:04:58] matter what the shepherd of it have to
[1:05:00] if it has to kill a whole pack of wolves
[1:05:02] to get to that sheep it'll do it yeah if
[1:05:05] it's going to take down a lion or a beer
[1:05:07] whatever it may be that may be after
[1:05:08] that sheep's life that Shepherd's gonna
[1:05:10] kill those animals because it's got that
[1:05:12] sheep and it's mine and it must get that
[1:05:14] sheep back it's not satisfied until that
[1:05:17] sheep is back in the fold so the same
[1:05:19] thing with God he doesn't get
[1:05:20] intimidated by the devil
[1:05:22] Henry's packing the Stinger of death
[1:05:24] he's already conquered he's got the keys
[1:05:26] of Hell death in the gray so he doesn't
[1:05:28] get intimidated by how bad the world
[1:05:30] gets or how bad our situation is that we
[1:05:32] think we're in amen but he is he is
[1:05:34] determined that all that the father has
[1:05:37] given me will come to me yeah
[1:05:39] hallelujah amen so now he's determined
[1:05:41] to find them now when he picks us up on
[1:05:44] our shoulders it's amazing where
[1:05:46] you know how easy a sheep is very
[1:05:49] susceptible to disease that's why you
[1:05:51] know who's heard the saying you're a bit
[1:05:53] of a dag
[1:05:55] who knows what a dag really is I don't
[1:05:58] know how it's a compliment but you know
[1:05:59] people are a bit and anyway
[1:06:01] but you know they they get they get Fly
[1:06:04] strike they get you know bugs and stuff
[1:06:06] under there under their wool and they
[1:06:08] get sick very easy they're gonna be
[1:06:09] drenched and looked after all the time
[1:06:11] their walls got to be cleaned and and
[1:06:12] they can't really do it themselves so
[1:06:14] that's why it takes God now because a
[1:06:16] trophy has to be mounted yeah
[1:06:20] right to actually for it to take its
[1:06:22] real glory
[1:06:24] amen so a real trophy is going to be
[1:06:26] mounted just like you know when we're in
[1:06:27] um when we're in Canada we're at uh uh
[1:06:30] Seth and Hannah O'Brien's house they've
[1:06:32] got these big this big bison head I
[1:06:34] think I put on the brothers yo I think
[1:06:35] their daughter shot the thing I think is
[1:06:37] that right some of that but yeah there's
[1:06:38] a big massive thing and then another one
[1:06:40] on the ground they had to put up on the
[1:06:41] wall too but it was this mad but it had
[1:06:43] to be mounted couldn't just be put in
[1:06:45] the garage yo it's got to be mounted in
[1:06:46] this right place look at this trophy
[1:06:47] there's a mammoth of a thing but you see
[1:06:50] it's the same thing now God doesn't just
[1:06:52] want to gather us and just that's it but
[1:06:55] he's got a place that's in our right
[1:06:57] setting
[1:06:58] amen all right Hallelujah so now he's
[1:07:02] got to clean us up restore us back into
[1:07:04] our rightful position in the sheepfall
[1:07:07] so he's going to take the diseases out
[1:07:09] of our life and I'm talking about
[1:07:10] spiritual diseases he you know our God
[1:07:12] doesn't just save us and then we're
[1:07:13] still stuck in the same you know who's
[1:07:15] ever seen a sheep all muddy and they're
[1:07:17] all you know fly-strucking and all
[1:07:19] sickly he doesn't leave us like that he
[1:07:21] heals us he takes those things away he
[1:07:23] cleans us up and that's why it's not
[1:07:25] just well you know I need his grace and
[1:07:27] I fall every day I get back up no
[1:07:29] there's overcoming power right there's
[1:07:31] overcoming power we go from glory to
[1:07:33] glory the things we once bothered us now
[1:07:35] that don't bother us anymore because
[1:07:36] we're climbing higher every day right
[1:07:39] Amy it's that besetting sin that that
[1:07:41] beset us Once Upon a Time doesn't beset
[1:07:43] us anymore right because we're going
[1:07:44] higher in the law then that's how it
[1:07:46] should be amen it's not just a cycle all
[1:07:49] the way of going around the mountain no
[1:07:50] no we're gaining ground we're becoming
[1:07:52] more like him
[1:07:54] Hallelujah because we're going to
[1:07:56] realize that yo our lord Jesus all power
[1:07:59] is given unto him in heaven and on Earth
[1:08:00] he has the keys of hell and of death
[1:08:03] that's Revelations one right when the
[1:08:07] Stinger of death met God it had never
[1:08:09] been the same this is Brother Baron from
[1:08:11] that time until now death is no Stinger
[1:08:13] so I just throw these things amen now he
[1:08:16] had these things so he conquered he
[1:08:18] conquered death he conquered all of the
[1:08:20] all the hordes of hell he has conquered
[1:08:22] he has conquered the man in an open show
[1:08:25] praise the Lord but you see he did that
[1:08:28] because he has a trophy in mind that's a
[1:08:30] trophy but it's not the trophy right he
[1:08:33] didn't just do that say look devil I've
[1:08:35] got your stinger you know death has no
[1:08:37] power anymore and all those things I've
[1:08:39] conquered sickness and you know every
[1:08:41] Spirit no he did those things to get you
[1:08:43] that's right he did those things to get
[1:08:46] you he took care of the sin question to
[1:08:47] get you so now our lord Jesus the
[1:08:50] greatest the greatest trophy he can ever
[1:08:52] get is you amen now he would he would
[1:08:55] stand after after he ascended in in Acts
[1:08:58] chapter one he's been our intercessor
[1:09:00] for for seven Church ages he's still
[1:09:02] there today interceding on our behalf
[1:09:04] right we always need blood right amen
[1:09:06] and then and then and then once we are
[1:09:08] up in glory well then the Jews need the
[1:09:10] blood because the grace goes back to
[1:09:11] them right they'll always be in
[1:09:13] atonement for somebody praise the Lord
[1:09:15] amen so I'm so thankful he's my mediator
[1:09:18] right now but then it came a point in
[1:09:20] this age where he would Advance forth
[1:09:22] and claim the sealed book in in
[1:09:25] Revelations four and five where the
[1:09:27] mighty Angel would cry out a strong
[1:09:29] Angel would Proclaim with a loud voice
[1:09:31] who's worthy to open the book and to
[1:09:32] lose the seals thereof now in that book
[1:09:34] was everything that Adam lost right and
[1:09:37] you're in that book because him taking
[1:09:39] the book brother Brown says it's the
[1:09:41] same as Boaz redeeming Ruth so it's not
[1:09:43] just a book with paper it's actually a
[1:09:45] living people
[1:09:46] as well amen so now here he is he's Kong
[1:09:49] he's got these trophies but he did all
[1:09:51] that so he can lay claim on you
[1:09:53] he can get you back to his side that's
[1:09:55] why he did all those things that's why
[1:09:57] he died on Calvary to redeem you back to
[1:09:59] your rightful position right there's a
[1:10:01] place by him amen for you to occupy amen
[1:10:04] so he would he would be there and then
[1:10:06] that cry would come forth and John would
[1:10:08] weep because no man was worthy to take
[1:10:10] the book all of the redeemed are
[1:10:12] represented in that scene so all the
[1:10:14] mighty prophets Enoch was there Joseph
[1:10:17] was there Moses was there Elijah there
[1:10:19] Elijah King David all the mighty mighty
[1:10:22] men and women of the ages down through
[1:10:23] and we're represented in that scene as
[1:10:25] well
[1:10:25] I mean but none of us are worthy because
[1:10:28] of our first birth right because of our
[1:10:31] sexual birth we are we are born wrong to
[1:10:33] begin with but but there was one who was
[1:10:35] born that bypassed the original sin our
[1:10:38] lord Jesus and so the cry was who's
[1:10:40] worthy and then he began to weep but
[1:10:42] then because no man was found worthy to
[1:10:45] take the book but then one of the elders
[1:10:47] said don't whip John
[1:10:48] don't weep don't weep on your state this
[1:10:52] is not the end you're not stuck where
[1:10:54] you are you think you're stuck but
[1:10:55] you're not stuck creation you may think
[1:10:57] creation is stuck but it's not stuck
[1:10:58] that's why there's never too big a hole
[1:11:01] that God can't get you out of but I'll
[1:11:03] say don't fall in in the first place if
[1:11:05] you can avoid it you should be able to
[1:11:07] avoid it if you're surrendered to God
[1:11:08] right but there's no sometimes we we
[1:11:10] look up and we say how can I get out of
[1:11:12] this
[1:11:13] that's just the bleeding of the sheep
[1:11:14] and God can reach down and pick you up
[1:11:16] amen so he says don't weep
[1:11:19] because the lion of the tribe are due to
[1:11:21] the root of David hasbrovals to open the
[1:11:24] book and to lose the Seven Seals are off
[1:11:25] so the one who has a stinger of death
[1:11:28] walked in from The Eternity and he took
[1:11:31] that book and brother says it's the most
[1:11:33] Sublime act in scripture why is it the
[1:11:36] most Sublime acting strip scripture
[1:11:38] because he was one no man could do it
[1:11:40] but the Lambs right and God's God's law
[1:11:43] required a kinsman redeemer but no one
[1:11:46] is born worthy of it but then God's
[1:11:48] grace produced the product and our Lord
[1:11:50] Jesus Christ which fulfilled his law and
[1:11:53] now we can be redeemed praise the Lord
[1:11:55] back to our God Amen so so now he has a
[1:11:59] trophy
[1:12:00] amen but he wants to put this book
[1:12:04] in your hand in your mouth The
[1:12:07] Inheritance right and it's also as I
[1:12:09] said it's it's symbolic of Boaz
[1:12:12] redeeming Ruth amen amen that she went
[1:12:15] from a widow with nothing to be Mrs Boaz
[1:12:18] of Bethlehem he was a mighty man of
[1:12:20] wealth she became a mighty woman of
[1:12:22] wealth because of everything uh he he
[1:12:24] had and then she came to the lineage of
[1:12:26] Jesus Christ coming right praise the
[1:12:28] Lord now it says in Malachi 3 and 16.
[1:12:33] we just read this then they that feared
[1:12:35] the Lord spake often one or to another
[1:12:38] and the Lord hearkened and heard it and
[1:12:41] a book of remembrance was written before
[1:12:42] him for them that feared the Lord and
[1:12:45] that thought upon his name yeah praise
[1:12:47] the Lord you talk about God God begins
[1:12:49] to write a book of remembrance that's
[1:12:50] right that's right amen are the things
[1:12:52] you do things you talk about
[1:12:55] amen so if you've them that fed the Lord
[1:12:57] and thought upon his name and they shall
[1:13:00] be mindset the Lord of hosts in that day
[1:13:02] when I make up my jewels and I will
[1:13:04] spare them as a man spareth his own son
[1:13:07] that serveth him so there's going to
[1:13:09] come a time he says I'll make I will
[1:13:12] they shall be mine so if they are mine
[1:13:15] they're not the devil so if they're Gods
[1:13:16] they're not the Devils that's why you
[1:13:18] gotta settle in your heart the devil has
[1:13:20] no pardon me I have no pardon him so
[1:13:22] blood totally broke that chain broke
[1:13:24] that Union Yes yes amen amen I believe
[1:13:27] it Hallelujah says in that day in the
[1:13:30] day when I make up my jewels and that
[1:13:33] says in Zechariah 9 and 16 and the Lord
[1:13:35] their God shall save them in that day as
[1:13:37] the flock of his people and they shall
[1:13:39] be as the stones of a crown lifted up as
[1:13:42] an in sign upon his land oh how great is
[1:13:46] his goodness and how great is his beauty
[1:13:48] corn shall be shall make the young men
[1:13:51] cheerful and new wine the mates that
[1:13:53] means they shall be as stones of a crown
[1:13:57] now you think about stones or Jewels you
[1:13:59] know we just had the Queen's funeral and
[1:14:01] you know some of the biggest diamonds in
[1:14:03] the world are in those crown jewels
[1:14:04] there and but you see when that Jewel
[1:14:06] was found it wasn't cut like that she
[1:14:09] could hold that stone up or have you
[1:14:11] know and and there'd be no sunlight to
[1:14:13] come through it to show it's inner
[1:14:15] beauty
[1:14:16] and it's the same thing with you and I
[1:14:18] you know our Lord's got to take us out
[1:14:21] of the earth we can be covered in a lot
[1:14:23] of things like the woman like Legion was
[1:14:25] covered in a lot of dirt
[1:14:27] Legions of Devil's had him covered over
[1:14:29] right he was barely a resemblance of a
[1:14:31] human being he was naked in the tombs
[1:14:34] cutting himself attacking people that
[1:14:35] came by worse than a wild animal but
[1:14:38] then brother Brown says unconverted man
[1:14:39] is actually worse than a beast and so so
[1:14:42] here he was buried in a lot of Earth but
[1:14:44] the Lord knew there was a jewel There
[1:14:46] Our God's a prospector but he can look
[1:14:49] right into a mountain and see where the
[1:14:51] gold is where the diamonds are every
[1:14:53] precious thing in that mountain he can
[1:14:55] see and that's why he looks into your
[1:14:57] heart
[1:14:57] and he because he's the great prospect
[1:14:59] that he can look beyond what even you
[1:15:01] see you take this say say this hill for
[1:15:04] example I'm not saying it's there but
[1:15:05] imagine if this hill was actually just a
[1:15:07] hill of gold
[1:15:08] and all he had to dig down was this much
[1:15:10] and it was just this motherload of the
[1:15:11] best gold in the world now if we look
[1:15:13] from the outside we say there's no value
[1:15:15] of that Hill yeah I mean there's there's
[1:15:17] there's some weeds and some you know
[1:15:20] there's a house there and some trees and
[1:15:22] there's not 10 billion dollars of value
[1:15:24] in that Health if we just look from the
[1:15:26] outside yeah but if you had an eye and
[1:15:29] you could look into that Hill you'd say
[1:15:30] no there's 10 billion dollars worth of
[1:15:32] gold in that Health it just has to be
[1:15:34] revealed and then the other people will
[1:15:36] see hey what that person's saying is
[1:15:38] true so it's the same thing with us many
[1:15:40] times we look at this thing we say there
[1:15:42] ain't 10 000 words worth of value in
[1:15:45] this thing
[1:15:46] yeah all right man but then you need the
[1:15:48] prospected account just like the Lord
[1:15:50] can look into our hearts and see there
[1:15:53] is the most valuable jewel in existence
[1:15:56] as in the heart of man right so then he
[1:15:59] begins to prospect so he takes you and
[1:16:01] there's something in you says yes Lord I
[1:16:03] will go I will come unto you oh God take
[1:16:05] my life make it thine but it doesn't
[1:16:07] just take a hump of rock and then put it
[1:16:09] in a crown remember he he's here to get
[1:16:12] trophies yes right he's here to get
[1:16:14] trophies but the trophy's got to be
[1:16:16] mounted now we're our heads are not
[1:16:18] being stuck on a wall like a bison all
[1:16:20] right right or a stag or whatever no but
[1:16:22] where jewels to be put in his crown
[1:16:25] now the value or the Majesty of a
[1:16:29] kingdom can be symbolized and how big
[1:16:31] the crown is and how Priceless the
[1:16:34] jewels are that's right right you take
[1:16:35] the yo yo you're the crown jewels of
[1:16:38] England some of those diamonds are that
[1:16:39] they are unique they cannot be replaced
[1:16:42] if they got stolen you they can't make
[1:16:44] another one they can't find another one
[1:16:46] yeah yeah right it's just the same thing
[1:16:48] with us God wants to show off his
[1:16:50] trophies
[1:16:52] and we are not just the bride of Christ
[1:16:55] is not just some common you know false
[1:16:57] gold or some little very common kind of
[1:17:02] cubic zirconium or whatever some fake
[1:17:04] diamond no where we are unique
[1:17:08] yeah you may not think you're special
[1:17:10] and unique but God knows that's how you
[1:17:12] are right so we take you as this hunk of
[1:17:16] rock but he wants a prospect now he
[1:17:18] wants to take that rock and get out the
[1:17:20] diamond amen oh look just like the Sheep
[1:17:23] that's caught up in the mountain see we
[1:17:25] read there in Matthew 18 that the that
[1:17:27] the shepherd rejoices more in the one
[1:17:29] that he found than the 99 he already had
[1:17:31] why because that that sheep becomes a
[1:17:34] trophy of his grace and of his
[1:17:36] determination God's very determined amen
[1:17:39] God's determined to have a body without
[1:17:41] spot or wrinkle washed in his blood oh I
[1:17:43] believe it amen so so now here we are
[1:17:46] with this with these uh precious stones
[1:17:49] he'll take us and then he'll wash us and
[1:17:52] then he'll cut us
[1:17:54] praise the Lord because he wants he
[1:17:56] wants his light to shine through us I
[1:17:59] mean you take any kind of
[1:18:01] um precious stone you hold it up to the
[1:18:03] light and and you see the light is
[1:18:05] reflected through it and it gives a
[1:18:07] certain color and different things and
[1:18:09] the and the and the person that knows
[1:18:11] how to cut Stones I know nothing about
[1:18:12] this but the person knows how to cut
[1:18:14] Stones knows exactly how much to cut in
[1:18:17] order to to retain the greatest value in
[1:18:19] the stone and to make it Sparkle the
[1:18:21] most
[1:18:22] now with us God doesn't lose any of our
[1:18:24] value when he cuts us crazy right but
[1:18:26] he's he's revealing a hidden character a
[1:18:28] hidden beauty that was already within us
[1:18:31] now brother Brian she's here in the um
[1:18:32] the Masterpiece now we know our lord
[1:18:34] Jesus was the first Masterpiece right
[1:18:36] you know well rather Adam and Eve were
[1:18:38] the first Masterpiece but then God after
[1:18:41] the devil marred that Masterpiece and he
[1:18:43] wouldn't be defeated he's going to
[1:18:44] rebuild it
[1:18:45] so Jesus our lord Jesus was the second
[1:18:48] Adam so he was the first part of that
[1:18:50] Masterpiece husband and wife together as
[1:18:52] one and then he was going to rebuild the
[1:18:54] second part of that Masterpiece which is
[1:18:56] the bride of Christ and so brother Brown
[1:18:58] would say this as it had taken him four
[1:19:00] thousand years to make this masterpiece
[1:19:01] that he's been so so that so that's our
[1:19:04] Lord now he's been for nearly 2 000
[1:19:06] years making another Masterpiece a bride
[1:19:08] for Christ another Masterpiece in doing
[1:19:10] so he does it by his never-changing
[1:19:12] method the same way he made the
[1:19:14] Masterpiece his word that's the way he
[1:19:17] makes his masterpieces because he can
[1:19:19] only be a perfect Masterpiece when it's
[1:19:21] the perfect word any dirt or trash
[1:19:24] injections it'll break but Heaven and
[1:19:26] Earth will pass away but that word will
[1:19:28] never break you remember in cutting of a
[1:19:30] diamond that you have to have a perfect
[1:19:32] tool to do it with not just any piece to
[1:19:34] do it I've seen tons of them big
[1:19:36] Grinders Crush right through it and move
[1:19:39] over big tons over and pass that diamond
[1:19:41] right on through no it won't break the
[1:19:43] diamond it has to be cut yeah I mean
[1:19:46] amen it has to be cut and then he says
[1:19:49] this in the evening miss you oh this old
[1:19:51] Bible's full of gold gracious nuggets I
[1:19:54] like to prosper I mean prospect on you
[1:19:56] and just go in there and Shake all the
[1:19:58] dust off it and look at it and see it
[1:19:59] see what it is how the jewels you know
[1:20:01] they're um you people here in in Arizona
[1:20:04] the great jewels that come from the dust
[1:20:06] of the earth and where they come from
[1:20:07] and God's Jewels are brought up from the
[1:20:09] dust too we're so happy he gives us the
[1:20:11] privilege of going into his great
[1:20:13] Refinery and all the dross be taken out
[1:20:16] yeah so he will take us now but he's not
[1:20:19] going to set us in the way he finds us
[1:20:20] but he knows within us because he's the
[1:20:22] great Prospect who can look into every
[1:20:24] heart and say that's the diamond I need
[1:20:26] that's the Ruby I've lost that you know
[1:20:28] this is a sapphire what right who's
[1:20:30] going to set us as jewels in his crowns
[1:20:33] Hallelujah see how God doesn't put us in
[1:20:35] the corner somewhere no he loves because
[1:20:38] if you see see someone with a great big
[1:20:40] you know crown on where where is your
[1:20:42] attention drawn to the bling there
[1:20:44] walking him right that's the bling
[1:20:47] they've got it's the same thing with our
[1:20:48] Lord I don't mean anything about
[1:20:49] sacrilegious that way but I want to get
[1:20:51] your attention same thing with us he
[1:20:52] loves to show us off look at my trophies
[1:20:56] look at my Jewels look at the ones that
[1:20:58] I have found and I've and I've you know
[1:21:00] and then he cuts Us by his word amen
[1:21:03] right so he'll cut Superstition off us
[1:21:05] he'll cut every Spirit off us that's not
[1:21:08] of him right so spiritually may have
[1:21:10] been you're inherited you know of you
[1:21:13] know of malice or unforgiveness business
[1:21:15] resentment even lust Spirits are passed
[1:21:17] down you know we can be in a place we
[1:21:19] can you know
[1:21:21] people get alcoholic Spirits because
[1:21:23] they start drinking alcohol too much and
[1:21:25] that Spirit jumped or drugs are saying
[1:21:27] that Spirit gets into them all
[1:21:28] witchcraft super religious Spirits they
[1:21:30] all but he wants to cut those off
[1:21:32] because he cannot reflect himself
[1:21:34] through a jewel that's covered in that
[1:21:36] kind of mud and he doesn't want us leave
[1:21:38] us covered in mud and dirt he wants to
[1:21:39] cut those things off because he wants to
[1:21:41] hold us up in his life
[1:21:43] and see us reflect himself amen
[1:21:47] hallelujah so we've got to be cut for
[1:21:49] all these things are going to be cut
[1:21:50] from us that's why it's so important
[1:21:52] when we when we realize the value of
[1:21:55] giving ourselves to the word of God
[1:21:57] right because he wants to cut us and
[1:21:59] shape us and set us in a right setting
[1:22:01] which is his crown his jewels now it's
[1:22:04] so important the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:07] Ghost is incredible is incredibly vital
[1:22:09] amen that is incredibly vital now I want
[1:22:12] to make a segue here because I'm talking
[1:22:13] about Jill's being sent now many times
[1:22:16] we think of adoption as some far-off
[1:22:19] thing in the future
[1:22:21] and the fullness of the adoption is the
[1:22:22] change of the body we understand that
[1:22:24] don't we so we're looking for the
[1:22:26] fullness of adoption the chain who's
[1:22:27] looking for a body change
[1:22:29] praise the Lord some people who are 10
[1:22:32] and under maybe not because they're
[1:22:33] enjoying being kid but the older you get
[1:22:35] the more you say man I need it I need an
[1:22:37] upgrade
[1:22:38] praise the Lord but you see that's the
[1:22:40] fullness of adoption and the book of
[1:22:41] Ephesians says we're predestined under
[1:22:43] the adoption of sons right so the
[1:22:45] fullness of that adoption is the change
[1:22:47] of the body so now I've been an adoption
[1:22:49] in the in the Bible if we read here in
[1:22:51] um Galatians 4 he says now I say this at
[1:22:54] the ear as long as he is a child
[1:22:56] different nothing from a servant though
[1:22:58] he be Lord of all but as under tutors
[1:23:00] and governors till the time appointed of
[1:23:01] the father even so we when we were
[1:23:04] children were in bondage under the
[1:23:05] elements of the world but when the
[1:23:07] fullness of the time was come God sent
[1:23:09] for the Sun made of a woman made under
[1:23:11] the law to redeem that to redeem them
[1:23:14] that we're under the law that we might
[1:23:15] receive the adoption of sons now this
[1:23:18] word adoption is the placing of a son it
[1:23:21] is not like in the western world or
[1:23:22] actually play every other part of the
[1:23:24] world where you get someone who's a
[1:23:26] child who's not blood relation to you
[1:23:28] not born of you and you and you adopt
[1:23:31] them or you bring them illegally into
[1:23:32] their into your family
[1:23:34] yeah that is not this adoption this
[1:23:37] adoption means in the Greek it means the
[1:23:39] placing of the sun yes so this is where
[1:23:42] that we would receive the adoption of
[1:23:44] Sun so we'll be placed in the body where
[1:23:47] he wants us to be in the body now some
[1:23:50] people want to put this off is that when
[1:23:52] I get adopted that I'll have all power
[1:23:54] I'll cast out Devils I'll be an
[1:23:56] overcomer I will conquer all when I'm
[1:23:59] there but no when you receive the
[1:24:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost now to me that
[1:24:04] is the adoption robe that's why it's so
[1:24:07] vitally important you get that robot and
[1:24:10] when you have that robon of the Holy
[1:24:11] Ghost that is like you being sent in his
[1:24:13] crown you're being cut by the word now
[1:24:16] how fast does it take to be cut by the
[1:24:17] world work word surrender a full death
[1:24:21] to self it's not a wrestle anymore of a
[1:24:23] negotiation process see many people
[1:24:25] wanted to negotiate with God you can
[1:24:28] have Sunday morning but I want Saturday
[1:24:29] morning or you know you can have
[1:24:32] Wednesday night but I want after
[1:24:33] Wednesday night you know I want this
[1:24:35] part no you can touch this part of my
[1:24:37] life sure I'll change how I dress but my
[1:24:39] private life is totally different
[1:24:42] it's not a full surrender but I want to
[1:24:44] keep my little hobby it's so important
[1:24:45] to me it won't be
[1:24:49] and be important things that we hold on
[1:24:51] to so much in this life will mean
[1:24:52] nothing over there
[1:24:54] right so it takes a full surrender
[1:24:58] because it's a big we say well but one
[1:25:01] day we'll receive power no okay I'll say
[1:25:03] this Caleb when he got his adoption
[1:25:06] he said well you know when he got his
[1:25:08] adoption he took his City his place in
[1:25:11] the land when did he have the power to
[1:25:13] conquer every enemy before he got there
[1:25:16] yeah
[1:25:17] right when he crossed the win when he's
[1:25:20] standing by Mount Sinai and he heard the
[1:25:23] word from Moses and he said we're more
[1:25:25] and then he went over with Joshua and
[1:25:27] said we're more than able to take the
[1:25:28] land he didn't go with the crowd God
[1:25:30] said he had another spirit with him what
[1:25:32] Spirit was that that was God's spirit it
[1:25:34] wasn't an unbelieving religious spirit
[1:25:36] it was the spirit of God and then so he
[1:25:38] had power God gave him power there to go
[1:25:41] take his Mountain so you could say he
[1:25:44] got on a new rope his adoption robe was
[1:25:47] that was when he received when when he
[1:25:49] got that different spirit with him but
[1:25:51] then that took him too receive his
[1:25:52] inheritance but he but he wasn't well
[1:25:55] one day when I take my Mountain then
[1:25:56] I'll bow to conquer every enemy no he
[1:25:59] received that power or that Authority
[1:26:01] before he physically took it right as
[1:26:03] the same thing with you and I people say
[1:26:06] one day one day when the bride is
[1:26:08] adopted one day when she's placed she's
[1:26:10] placed already see we're going to
[1:26:12] realize the position we're already been
[1:26:13] set in right brother Brown would say oh
[1:26:16] if the church only knew its position it
[1:26:19] will one day then the Rapture will go
[1:26:20] he's not saying when she gets into a
[1:26:23] position because you're going to look at
[1:26:24] chronologically where he is when he's
[1:26:26] preaching yeah right so even in the
[1:26:28] adoption series the church is on its way
[1:26:30] but the book hasn't come open yet right
[1:26:32] but then after that he says oh you know
[1:26:35] in Christ I miss you God revealed he
[1:26:36] says now the new birth is Christ is a
[1:26:38] revelation God has revealed it to you
[1:26:40] this great mystery that's a new birth
[1:26:42] now what are you going to do when you
[1:26:43] get all that group together when the
[1:26:45] Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and
[1:26:47] God expressing it through his word by
[1:26:49] the same actions the same things that he
[1:26:51] did make his word manifest oh if the
[1:26:53] church only knew its position it will
[1:26:55] one day then the Rapture will go when it
[1:26:57] knows what it is right
[1:27:00] he's not saying if they could only get
[1:27:02] there he said no the church is in its
[1:27:04] position but she doesn't realize where
[1:27:05] she is just like a jewel in a crown if
[1:27:08] you only realize where God has placed
[1:27:09] you oh yeah he hasn't put you in the
[1:27:11] cupboard he's not put you in a place of
[1:27:13] just dirt and Rick yo thinks he's not
[1:27:15] looking for no he came looking for you
[1:27:16] right and his word has cut you and he
[1:27:19] set you in his crown what to shine to
[1:27:22] reflect his life
[1:27:23] hallelujah
[1:27:25] amen so so if you've got if you truly
[1:27:28] have the Holy Ghost you are adopted
[1:27:30] Brotherhood since the adoption series
[1:27:31] it's like the tutor will take the take
[1:27:33] the sun says now we're going up this
[1:27:35] hill and then the sun says well as long
[1:27:37] as you're with me we'll get there you
[1:27:39] know but it's pretty steep now I'm
[1:27:40] coming with you and then he just stays
[1:27:42] with the tutor and then and then brother
[1:27:44] dramatizes the tutor goes to the father
[1:27:46] and says well how is he how's he going
[1:27:48] he says well he stays right with me
[1:27:50] trust your word exactly believes exactly
[1:27:52] what I tell him as well because the
[1:27:54] attitude becomes right right some people
[1:27:57] get angry at God God why'd you leave me
[1:27:59] here no it's because they're not fully
[1:28:00] trusting the tutor and when you fully
[1:28:02] trust the tutor then you get adopted you
[1:28:05] receive the Holy Ghost when you fully
[1:28:07] surrender right amen so it's not
[1:28:09] something we're not looking for this in
[1:28:10] the future that's right it's going on
[1:28:12] right now brother amps is an adopted
[1:28:15] position in the body is a housewife
[1:28:17] is that well that's such a common thing
[1:28:19] no that's very powerful you can stand
[1:28:21] there for your family you can Interstate
[1:28:22] for them you can you can pray on their
[1:28:24] behalf you can create an atmosphere in
[1:28:26] the home maybe when they step in then
[1:28:28] all the devil could be piled up and then
[1:28:29] they walk through the door those bugs
[1:28:31] have got to fly those Spirits have got
[1:28:33] to get out because white there's an
[1:28:34] atmosphere in the home Amos let's not
[1:28:36] just preachers who are adopted or
[1:28:38] deacons or musicians no it's the whole
[1:28:40] body but we've got to realize that we've
[1:28:42] received if you really have the Holy
[1:28:43] Ghost you have that adoption robot I
[1:28:46] mean you've already been cut by the word
[1:28:48] now God just wants to shine his light
[1:28:50] through you that's what he wants to do
[1:28:53] Hallelujah that's what he wants to do
[1:28:55] now why does he want to do that it's
[1:28:57] like David's Mighty Man
[1:29:00] if David can down that giant and his
[1:29:02] anointing is upon me I can do the same
[1:29:04] thing I said it earlier so I've got to
[1:29:05] realize no it's not one day we'll be
[1:29:07] able to no now we can that's why we
[1:29:09] shouldn't put up for dead stiff services
[1:29:12] and that's why we shouldn't put up for a
[1:29:14] dead prayer life right we should be
[1:29:16] under expectation just like Daniel
[1:29:18] praying oh Jehovah God hallelujah and
[1:29:21] God would come down and step into his
[1:29:23] prayer meetings and just like in the
[1:29:25] book of Acts God would come down and
[1:29:27] change things he'd take over their
[1:29:29] voices and pray things that they never
[1:29:30] thought of that's how we should be
[1:29:32] that's what we should expect it's not us
[1:29:35] trying to generate anything not to
[1:29:36] surrender to him say Lord what would you
[1:29:39] have prayed what kind of life would you
[1:29:41] have lived today Lord come and live in
[1:29:43] my life Shine Your Life Through Me
[1:29:47] Hallelujah because you have Jewel sin
[1:29:50] and darkness that they just look like
[1:29:52] they're just in darkness but when you
[1:29:54] hold them into the light oh yeah you can
[1:29:56] look at man that was great craftsmanship
[1:29:58] I'm so amazed how did that person do
[1:30:01] that look at the sitting there put them
[1:30:02] in and you begin to Marvel at the crown
[1:30:04] jewels
[1:30:05] Hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[1:30:07] you and I when the light of the word
[1:30:09] when the Holy Ghost comes on shines out
[1:30:11] of our Lives people should stand Yo God
[1:30:14] stands in all I think the Angels
[1:30:15] standing or as well
[1:30:17] look at this achievement goal
[1:30:20] they were standing there when he said
[1:30:22] that there'd be sun moon and stars and
[1:30:23] nebulas formed in universes and you know
[1:30:26] all all of creation
[1:30:28] was formed because he believed his own
[1:30:30] word but then he put a people on free
[1:30:32] moral agency now Angels know what free
[1:30:34] moral agency is because they could
[1:30:36] either
[1:30:37] listen to God or they could listen to
[1:30:39] The Devil's lion fall they had a choice
[1:30:41] they were put on choice too right so now
[1:30:43] now there's a people upon the Earth who
[1:30:45] have free moral agency
[1:30:47] and then God takes them
[1:30:49] and they give their whole lives over to
[1:30:51] him and then he cuts and shapes them
[1:30:53] because they can see the diamond in them
[1:30:55] and he shines his light through and the
[1:30:58] angels say
[1:30:59] what's the most great incredible thing
[1:31:01] I've ever seen
[1:31:02] a people have surrendered their will and
[1:31:05] willingly give their lives out of
[1:31:07] thankfulness and joy and love and it's
[1:31:09] not them living no more but God and they
[1:31:11] see the same one that created all this
[1:31:13] and they see the workmanship of his
[1:31:15] hands upon the Earth and they say truly
[1:31:17] this is great
[1:31:19] Hallelujah
[1:31:22] I trust
[1:31:24] when you look at yourself
[1:31:26] you will see yourself how God sees you
[1:31:29] amen he's not ashamed of you amen he's
[1:31:33] proud of us we are his greatest
[1:31:35] achievement yeah I mean hallelujah amen
[1:31:43] and this and that another and be babied
[1:31:46] I expect my place out yonder
[1:31:49] I expect my place out yonder with the
[1:31:52] rugged I expect not to come up there
[1:31:54] with no trophy scars at all I must fight
[1:31:56] if I must Reign increase my courage Lord
[1:31:59] oh let me sound like a Christian not a
[1:32:01] hybrid plant not to be babied and pitted
[1:32:04] and brought in something if you're not
[1:32:06] brought anyhow Christianity you're born
[1:32:07] into it you become a new creature you're
[1:32:09] a seed of God that comes into the Earth
[1:32:11] this is I don't want to have no trophy
[1:32:13] scars when I'm there
[1:32:16] soldiers who lived their whole life and
[1:32:19] fight no Wars have no scars
[1:32:21] they can have campaign medals or
[1:32:23] something for doing certain things
[1:32:24] peacekeeping whatever more but soldiers
[1:32:27] have really been on the battlefield yeah
[1:32:29] and it's been life or death and they've
[1:32:31] been in the front line and they've even
[1:32:32] looked the enemy in the eyes he gets
[1:32:34] that close
[1:32:35] those ones have got trophy scars
[1:32:38] right now that's just in the negative of
[1:32:39] War but what about when we March up one
[1:32:42] day and we have trophy scars of his
[1:32:44] grace where we went beyond the status
[1:32:47] quo of Our Lives see those who are in
[1:32:50] the barracks will never get trophy scars
[1:32:51] those are gone to the battlefield they
[1:32:54] actually go beyond just the everyday
[1:32:56] life they get the trophy scars so what
[1:32:58] about us well what trophy scars could we
[1:33:00] have well I've got calluses on my knees
[1:33:03] from prayer oh my so maybe got lines on
[1:33:05] my face from from crying and rejoicing
[1:33:09] you know if I'm actually actually
[1:33:10] opening up my heart to someone else to
[1:33:12] really kind of gone to their burden I've
[1:33:14] got a scarf and being misunderstood
[1:33:16] maybe yeah right I mean you don't want
[1:33:18] to have those kind of trophy scars where
[1:33:20] we could actually look back what
[1:33:22] happened here well this was a hockey
[1:33:24] stick but in the you know in the
[1:33:25] spiritual there's a devil trying to kill
[1:33:27] my life
[1:33:28] amen what about this one well he did
[1:33:30] this but but God got me out of it just
[1:33:32] like Caleb could have said where'd you
[1:33:34] give this guy daddy maybe one of his
[1:33:36] children said that was a whiff in Egypt
[1:33:38] but I'm not but I'm no longer a slave
[1:33:40] God delivered me that's why it becomes a
[1:33:42] trophy scum what about this one oh that
[1:33:45] was a that was a stab of a sword when I
[1:33:46] was taking my city but I'm in the city
[1:33:48] I'm no longer fighting that battle I'm
[1:33:51] not the victory should be the same thing
[1:33:52] with your own eye
[1:33:54] Hallelujah
[1:33:56] but why does he want to give us trophy
[1:33:57] scars why do we want trophy scars why do
[1:33:59] we want to see God live why do we want
[1:34:01] trophies because one day we'll go up
[1:34:05] before the throne I'm going to close
[1:34:06] with this thought we're gonna go up
[1:34:08] before the throne
[1:34:09] and he's going to place a crown on our
[1:34:11] heads which is all of his testimonies
[1:34:15] that he gave us
[1:34:16] but then we're going to take it off
[1:34:18] because who gave it to you
[1:34:20] and we're going to place it down at his
[1:34:22] feet
[1:34:24] Hallelujah where's nothing oh yes I am
[1:34:26] this no no Lord you earned it in my life
[1:34:28] that's why he died on Calvary that's why
[1:34:30] you redeemed me that's why you shed your
