thank you for the specials as well we thoroughly enjoyed them praise the Lord amen so God bless you all tonight we're just going to go to the scripture we're going to go to um Exodus chapter 12 and we're going to read from verse 21. um yeah so it's a so it's a swap from last Wednesday so last Wednesday I was unwell and Christine was here and this Wednesday I'm here in Christine's done well so that dumb devil man but hey the Lord's given us the victory amen even in sickness hey we praise the Lord anyway so amen so God bless you all amen um yeah so keep her and everyone else who's unwell and pray I mean we're just going to read uh Exodus 12 here and then we're gonna go to Hebrews 11. then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take your lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the Basin and none of you shall go out out at the door of his house until the morning for the Lord will pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he see it the blood upon the lintel and on the two side uh post the Lord will pass over the door I will not suffer the Destroyer to come and unto your come in unto your houses to Smite you you shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy Sons forever that means every generation's got to apply the blood amen so then we go to Hebrews 11 we've got first three verses then we're going to jump down to verse 33 as well um I mean say man if you're there or if you're looking and you can see it's there amen Hebrews 11 and 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear then we're going to go down to verse 33 who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant and fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women receive their dead race to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection yeah amen and and we won't read it but you can keep reading down you know when you go home but it says of whom the world is not worthy these people have this kind of a faith amen and I'm persuaded that that faith is alive Amen in this room tonight in our hearts amen so this bow heads in a word of prayer tonight amen if you want to be remembering of prayer you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen Grace his father we're so thankful we can gather tonight Lord and your great divine presence we thank you Lord for your great mercy and love towards us we're so thankful dear God that we can come into your presence once again and Lord we're just asking may you come and take control of the service Lord Lord we know without you we can do nothing but Lord through you we can do all things amen so Lord we just want to surrender ourselves completely Lords both speaker and hearer Lord may you come and just have church through us oh God yes may you do what you want to do in the service Lord and we pray for those who couldn't be here tonight Lord It's Lord think of my darling at home Lord and William Lord may he raise her up Lord we thank you to buy your stripes she's healed dear God and Father anyone else who's Afflicted and body Lord may you be their portion we want to remember Andy and Isaac up north Lord Brother Isaacs ministering or brother Malcolm's tonight I pray you would fill his mouth with your word Lord For Your Glory for the people's needs Lord we're so thankful father we love you and we praise you and give you glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen God bless your friends you may have your seats tonight I want to talk about our faith faith this common Faith Overlook you know faith is a very overlooked thing that we possess you know I was after the baptisms um a couple of Sundays ago I was I was noticing I think it was General Malachi were doing a bit of landscaping there by the Riverside and one of them had a had had some kind of a weed in their hand I said you know that's like common Faith you know your faith is like that weed you have it's such a common thing you know as we read there in Exodus chapter 12 that they were commanded to take a bunch of hyssop and um and and and that's the that's the that's the paintbrush that they would use Amen to apply the blood to their houses the door and lentil that the death angel could not strike and that you know herself was not some some some very rarest of the rare plant up some mountains somewhere they had to go across the world to find but it was growing everywhere coming out of the cracks and the crevices you know it's amazing where weeds can grow rocks you know I remember when we used to live over here you know there was a bunch of seeds and stuff would come down off the bank and they'll be just on solid concrete and massive yeah you know just just weeds growing they don't even have root you know any soil to go down into but yet they're growing just a common weeds growing everywhere but that's how common faith is you know faith is a very common thing hey the Lord typed it to hyssop right so he's not saying it's a rare thing so the faith that we use to apply the blood Amen in every situation of life is a common weed is it called faith is a common thing I mean the same Faith you used to turn on the light bulb is the same faith that you can you can apply every promise of God with amen so let's not Overlook the faith that's in our position right now amen I'm so thankful that we're not just taking the hyssop taking our faith and just got nothing to apply or use it in amen you know we don't have some Creed we're trying to apply to our lives but as the blood of Jesus Christ himself it means I'm so thankful that we have that kind of a faith now Faith we know is a it's a substance of things hoped for we read it's the evidence of Things Not Seen so it's not some mental workup it's not some kind of just trying to you know some kind of mental illusion but something you actually possess something you have it's actually the the substance of something that you're hopeful so a promise that you're looking to be fulfilled in your life when you receive faith for that promise it's actually the evidence of that thing's gonna happen I don't know I mean because we do not walk by faith I mean by sight we walk by faith amen now brother Braham tells us that you know there's well we know that there's um five senses that we've been given to come contact our Earthly home but not one of those is actually meant to guide man brother Brown tells us now I want to get you something here God when he made man gave him five senses and those five senses of see taste feel smell in here as we all know those five senses were not given to a man to guide him that seems quite strange because you know when you you know you go through natural man would think no I I need those five senses to guide me through life but they're not there to guide you through life those five senses will not guide you through this life amen that's actually only given for us to contact our Earthly home I mean the sea tastes feel smell in here that and that's your Earthly senses we're not see and they were not given to you to guide you but God sent the Holy Spirit and he's your guide the sixth sense I mean that makes you believe things that you can't see taste feel smell or hear that Sixth Sense something that raised you up and only one class of people has that sixth sense that's Believers so I believe I'm talking to people who have that sixth sense right now amen Believers have that Sixth Sense amen Hebrews 11 and 1 said by faith and without faith it's impossible to please God so God gives man faith and faith is a sixth sense that makes you deny anything that's contrary to his word amen and you're so thankful we have that kind of ability amen if something declares in our body that we're never going to overcome we may feel down we don't we can we can subdue that feeling and bring get subject to the word of God if there's something warring in our memories of some person that we committed and they would put it under the blood the devil brings it back in our mind we can take our sixth sense faith and subdue that memory and say no Satan I'm going to update that memory for the day where I became a Believer and you got defeated out of my life see we've got to let Faith loose and control of Our Lives amen our I you know our five senses should not dictate our Victory to us amen remember faith is our Victory amen Faith gives us victory over this world over this evil age over every devil amen Faith gives us the victory the Bible said amen is not our five senses give us the Victorious not what we can think in our mind gives us the victory no it's faith amen I trust you can just just just just join in with me tonight I mean because remember we've got this common see faith can be such an overlooked thing so sometimes we think we need some big super duper Faith to overcome no the common Faith you have already that Faith you may be overlooking think it's not enough it's more than enough I mean because that hyssop that applied the blood was more than enough to apply the blood there in Egypt's the same faith that we've been given as more than enough to overcome I mean to apply the blood to every part of our Lives amen hallelujah but you see now Faith see faith faith subdues faith overtakes Faith conquers I mean see we are not here just to put up with the devil's nonsense you know you know man has an idea that you know things are just going to work out in a natural way yeah right amen like a sickness we think well it's a virus it's got to take this long to work out you'll have these kind of symptoms and this is going to happen this way and you've just got to let it run its course who said we have to let it run its course amen anything in life Faith interrupts the devil's plans I mean Faith always interrupts what the devil thinks he's gonna do I mean the devil thought that he had Israel trapped in Egypt but then Faith interrupted his plans in the form of the Prophet Moses and God anointed Moses and went and took them out why because Faith interrupted the devil's plans and faith will interrupt if you let your faith control you not your reasoning control you but your faith control you amen that faith will interrupt the devil's plans every time all right amen you say well it doesn't seem like it's being answered well real faith will trust God no matter what the answer is amen because remember our Victor and our joy should not be based on current circumstances no that's actually our five senses dictating to us how much of a Christian we are yeah so we shouldn't be it doesn't matter how you know we're gonna we're gonna let Faith raise us above all the gloom and doom in this world Amen because Faith gives us wings to fly amen because because remember we walk in a different kind of an atmosphere with the Sixth Sense we contact a world that the rest of the world doesn't know nothing about and when we contact heaven with this success amen with this Faith amen we contact the promises of God we're walking around that's different see we can rejoice in the promises of God Amen we can Rejoice then because they're so real they're so tangible to us aren't they Hallelujah we can have Fellowship about what God has done in the past and and and and and all we're really doing is actually remembering the times where God was taking on his word and God said I'll prove that in your life but then you go on the street and start sharing those same things to people who have know nothing about God they think you're a crazy man what because you're living in a world they know nothing about amen but I trust that by God's grace they will know the world that you live in so you see it's just because other people are walking in Doom and Gloom atmosphere doesn't mean we have to live in that same kind of atmosphere Faith lifts us above the doom and the Gloom maybe you could be you can be in a house where there's a real gloomy kind of you know Spirit everything's dark and heavy you don't have to live in that atmosphere faith will lift you above that atmosphere if you let it lift Hallelujah just so just because everyone else is gloomy doesn't mean you've got to get gloomy just because everyone else is weary doesn't mean we have to be weary we can be rejoicing everyone else can have the longest face in the world Amen they look like a bunch of horses but we can be rejoicing I mean why because faith has given us the victory over every problem Hallelujah amen you say well wonder I get that Faith No no you've got that Faith now hey have you ever given your life to the Lord you have that Faith hallelujah hallelujah amen if you got faith in the word of God what is that that is genuine faith never let the devil diminish that at all Hallelujah amen see faith faith takes control of situations you know the Apostle Peter was in prison one day and it's amazing when you think about it he was going to be executed in the morning but he got comfortable in his prison took off his shoes took off his coat said well I must just sleep here and enjoy the place and people can get so used to the prison they're in and many times we try and we try and mentally with our five senses try and get them out of the prison of unbelief they're in but you've got to realize your wrestling against demon powers you're not fighting against the person and reasoning and trying to work out things no no it's it's it takes the power of prayer it takes faith I mean to unlock the prison because Peter got used to being in that prison when the angel came and woke him up he said put on your shoes good yourself you're getting out of here but he got comfortable enough to say well this is just me and people can get so used to the prison that they're in amen but facials say no they shouldn't be in that prison I mean because they had a perimeting that night I mean the angel went and got him out of that prison and got him out he thought he was having a dream but then when he walked out of the front Gates he came to himself and said I wasn't dreaming this hey man why because Faith Delivered him out of that prison Hallelujah said well what if it didn't well I'd say you know worry help no one but faith can deliver you know brother Bram said you know if I knew I was going to get shot in the morning he said what's the point of worrying it won't help me but Faith might deliver me that's why we're gonna let our faith take control of Our Lives not our not our five senses not our reasoning you know I remember when when Chris and I were living in Christchurch during the first earthquake there and the place is shaking we're having a prayer meeting by the front door and I wanted just to keep my eyes open to see what was going on but I thought no we're praying we're going to pray instead of just but the five senses wanted to because because for some reasons we think if we observe something we have control over it you know we'd have nothing I had no control over the earthquake of my eyes were open if my eyes were closed I had no control but we seem to think if we observe something hard enough we can take dominion over it no it takes our faith to have dominion over it hallelujah amen and and so what did I do I close my eyes and keep praying we had a glorious prayer time God came down and we had an awesome time when the world was shaking Hallelujah so that's what we should do I think Amen Let our faith take control amen Hallelujah now Faith is something I'm just going to go through a few things faith is something that you it's absolutely it's not just what you imagine it's a reality many people I say this with humble humility because see I may never see you again from tonight they're probably as people that are here I'll never see again in my life but I say that 80 of the people that comes to the platform don't know what faith is they have a hope but not faith faith is a substance of things hopeful the evidence of Things Not Seen amen so see it's not something that you work up mentally it's a reality to you it's become revealed to your heart it's not something in your mind thinking I hope this works you know it's done hey man see now Faith is a revelation from God now Faith is a revelation that's just where I want to stay here just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon Revelation a Baptist Minister told me not uh not long ago he said I just can't accept Revelation I said now you cannot then you cannot accept the Bible you cannot accept Christ because he is the revelation of God he's God revealed in flesh therefore the whole church is built upon divine revelation yeah amen so it's not something you work yourself up into oh I gotta have a big face no no it's something God gives and it can be such a common thing we'll just jump right over it and say I'm looking for this thing I need to overcome that and you've already got the faith to do it but then within how do I get more faith well Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen as I said a few you know a few Sundays ago you wanna you wanna you wanna focus on the promise feed on the promise till it becomes a revelation I mean it's not just a nice idea but you feed on it think about it pray about it until God makes it a revelation in your heart Hallelujah that's what we've got to do amen but you see now real faith has no conditions on it brother bear says you take your father it's always saying Lord I'll do this if you'll do this and things like that God knows he'll be a stuffed shirt anyhow so it's not a it's not a faith is not or prayer it's not a negotiation process with God the reason we know negotiate with God is because we're not surrendered to him fully in that certain situation amen so we've got to be fully fully sold out and let Faith have its perfect work amen see see for repentance or a mission of sins must be preached in his name to all the world beginning at Jerusalem Hallelujah Glory there you are what does Calvary mean to you what did that day do to you did it stuff you out with some theology did it make you a stuffed shirt or did it make you a Christian sold out hallelujah amen so what is Calvary done to you amen have you become a stuffed shirt a Mr or Mrs no at all or has it made you sold out a real Christian loving the Lord more than anything amen but you see now reasoning and Faith are two very different things and reasoning works against faith and Faith controls reasoning subdues reasoning amen now Faith knows no defeat faith is perfect Faith brings things when they were um where there is no thing to be brought Faith creates Faith takes doubt away takes negative and makes positive how beautiful the old man had a basis for faith faith is not Mystic mythical something mentally worked up is absolutely fundamental result that happens in a person's heart it means it's not something that's just a mythical mentally worked up one plus one equals two or window or whatever kind of drawing thing no no no no it's it's something happens in your heart you know it's there and the but the devil ways bring reasoning in to try and kick your faith off amen but that's why we've got to stand on stand on the word of God Alone who's with me tonight I mean I might be Plastering this a bit thick but I want you to see it amen because we don't want to be walking in the Realms of a mental idea but we're going to walk in the Realms of thus saith the Lord like a real faith in the word of God it's anchored in the word of God Amen that you know it so just like I trust that you know that you're saved amen right you don't think you're saved you know you're saved like you've come according to God's word but God's revealed it to you that he died for you on Calvary it's a revelation the blood is a revelation to you amen so what is that that's real faith and if you've realized that he died for you amen nothing can move you from it if it's a revelation in your heart Hallelujah no one can talk you out of it no one talked you into it God just drew you to it amen Hallelujah that's real Faith now look not because I'm standing here saying it but if you can understand how it is that faith is not something mentally perceived but it is by a revelation a revelation of God by faith not intellectual but by his uh but by his heart see your faith is not what you feel your faith is what you believe how many times do we let feelings Rob us or victory right no no no no faith faith is a revelation it's not a feeling see we could feel As Dead As opposed see the two on the way to Emmaus their lives are broken they're broken-hearted their whole world have fallen apart they are walking along with the resurrected Jesus Christ himself amen that was the condition I earned when the Lord came and and began to reveal himself to them and they are part of the Resurrection that's why Jesus went with them broke the Bread open their eyes all those things but you see it's not based on how we feel it's based on what we believe I mean if you're feeling down in the Lord you just begin to think about what you believe and what he's done for you and then you'll find your feelings will go upwards like this amen why because your feelings will begin to linen with what you believe amen that's what we should do amen always just take God take our take our take our testimony back to the word of God I mean see see we're not going to feel the rapture on the day when our bodies have changed in terms of uh well I'm wrapped you're ready today because I'm sure we've had a lot of those kind of days I'm going today is the day I'm ready next minute Lord help me I'm not ready but why if you go in my feelings it's a roller coaster of emotions amen but if you go no your faith is what you believe not what you feel amen then the devil can't whip you with your feelings anymore Hallelujah see faith is a subconscious Thing lady faith is not a mental act see it's something that you subconsciously do it people try to look to their intellectuals for Faith When Faith doesn't lay in there reasons lay here Faith lays in the soul see so like see see people try to look at the intellectuals their mind what they think what they perceive for their faith but Faith doesn't lay here reasoning does Faith lays here in the soul amen but you see now if you're trying to lay your your faith in your intellectuals we're reasoning in then unbelief will catch that reason I mean see see but unbelievable catch reason that's what it did now you get it unbelief relies on reasons present day things Faith don't won't do that see now see see he's saying here unbelief relies on reasons what's that that's going on in your mind the weighing all the weighing all the things together taking all the evidence and trying to lay it in there that's reasoning going on but you see unbelief relies on reasons present day things I think I thought that was a interesting how how the prophet put those two things together see present day things well how are you doing today yeah not so good then reasoning comes in well you must have done something wrong no not at all you know many times we we're actually getting an answer to prayer and we actually think it's actually not an answer to prayer like for example Saul but before he became Paul how he persecuted the church brother Ram said that was a man under conviction that was actually the believer's praise being answered by him kicking up and acting like that and sometimes someone starts fussing and fighting and tearing things up and we and we've prayed Lord get a hold of that person and they start acting that way and we think Lord what's wrong with my faith your faith is working real good yeah yeah just hold on to the promise you don't you don't live by what you see but we look to the Unseen right Faith doesn't look by the everyday thing right I mean Faith looks to the Unseen to the promise of God Hallelujah that's what see faith faith looks at the word amen but Faith places itself upon the unmovable Rock God's Eternal word amen Faith don't look at reason I don't care how much you can show it would be better if the word says no faith rests there that is the sanctuary of Faith's resting place Amen to someone can come along and try and reason things this is how it really should be but faith is no faith rests on the word and that's it I trust that's how you're walking by faith you're not walking by sight no walking by reason and listen this has got to happen first and this has got to be this way who said it's got to be that way you know there's been countless testimonies of people who've been immigrating to other countries and you know their files on the bottom of the pile but somehow God fast tracks their immigration and then they're in well how did that work well actually because God was the immigration agent right but many times you think well it'll be x amount of this six to 12 months I know I know what it is you know some countries it can be years but you know we think well it's just going to take this long and this is going to happen this way who said it's going to happen that way you know God can Inspire some some person walking I don't know what I'm talking about immigration but you know God could Inspire some immigration person instead of the top of the pole they get they're inspired to your your folder and they pick it up and they just go stamp stamp stamp boom and then you get an email that's there whoa God inspired the person to do it you know we we can we can limit God by thinking well things just have to work in a natural order no faith is not a natural order faith is a disrupter of the day Hallelujah let your faith disrupt Satan's Eden once in a while Hallelujah amen see as Jesus would say the scribes and Pharisees they um and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the Kingdom of Heaven should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation neither shall they say low here or Lo therefore behold the kingdom of God is within you so he's saying it's not mentally observed it's not mentally studied you don't the kingdom of God doesn't come with observations you don't study and then oh there's the kingdom of God it's not observed by the five senses no he says the kingdom of God is within you what is that that is the Holy Ghost within man I mean so if you ever see the baptism of the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God is within you yeah so it's not by observation facts and textbooks and understandings in schools of learning no it's none of those things amen Hallelujah now Faith does not deny problems Faith acknowledges problems hello brother William says this he says now you can't say I've I've got a sickness and I don't and I don't believe it's a sickness oh yes it's a sickness you got cancer you uh you don't believe it's a cancer but it's a cancer it's a cancer but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world we you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible it's exactly the way the scripture is written overcoming amen right so so Faith doesn't put blinkers on and say the problem's not there you see when chadrach Meshach and Bendigo were going to be thrown into the fiery furnace they didn't deny the furnace was there they didn't deny that the king's Cree I mean um commandment wasn't real they acknowledge those things by turning up to the whole ceremony right but they didn't deny those things I said sure King and you know isn't it amazing that they went into that furnace without even a promise that God would deliver them but they just made up their mind we're not going to burn I mean I mean sorry we're not going to Bow whatever the outcome is when we're still not going to Bowden you're edicto King but you see they didn't even have a promise I mean to go and you know yo that God would protect them but yeah God protected them in the fiery furnace hallelujah amen all that they could base here faith in was that yo that you Shone about her any image no other God you should worship that's right now I'm just trying to find you know um PowerPoints are very hazardous things for me because it never it's never chronological but you see Jesus Jesus Went to went to Calvary with one promise and that promise was I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption I'll not leave thy soul and hell no suffer the hollow undersea corruption that was the one scripture that was quickened to him that he knew that though he's going to die on Calvary he's not going to stay dead yeah he's going to come out of the grave now that same Faith so so he went to Calvary with one scripture right and he came out with that faith in that one scripture now the same faith that is in him comes into the believer because remember as Believers we don't believe with just a human Faith remember we start off with human Faith but we don't stop with human faith we start with it but we don't stop with it right because when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost another faith comes in right just as the Apostle Paul would say the life here we go the life I know he says I'm crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ livethon me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me he's saying another life I used to live one kind of life but then I met a lot on the road to Damascus now I've got a different kind of a life he is now the life I now live in this flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen so he wasn't living by his own human faith that he was born with no he is now living by God's own faith yeah Hallelujah so so now Jesus Jesus had Jesus had that same faith that Paul received Jesus went to the tomb with and came out because that same faith that Jesus had was in this one scripture a lot I'll not leave a soul with hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption so now that same Faith went into the Apostle Paul and lived out the portion of word that he had to live out and now we come down to this end time in that same faith that was in the Lord Jesus amen for that to be fulfilled and the same um faith that was in the Apostle Paul that he went to Rome he was told he was going to Rome his shipwreck bitten by poisonous snake all kinds of trouble but God said you're going to go there and so he went there right he didn't see his faith took control of the whole situation he was in a storm 14 days we realized I can't die on this boat I've got to get to Rome why because God had already revealed it to him that he had to be in Rome he wasn't hoping he was going to make it across their GNC you know across the Mediterranean to Rome it was a revealed to him he's going to Rome so as soon as the dark clouds started Gathering the swell started lifting and the wind started blowing and all the trouble was going on there was something already anchoring him saying I'm not gonna drown Hallelujah and then and so because he had that Revelation he went to God in prayer and then God sent his angels saying that you know the only thing going to be lost is the boat Hallelujah and then they you know Shipwrecked then he went to go get the firewood the snake came out bit him on the hand but he shook it off in the fire saying this thing can't stop me because I'm going to Rome it was a revelation he's going to Rome now friends we're not traveling to Italy Today Emma we're going to glory amen that's our final destination amen so I trust that God has anchored of faith in your soul amen that nothing can stop you on this side nothing can stop you on this Earth because your final destination is glory amen because the devil cannot undo what God has already done amen so before the foundation of the world if he if God put your name on Islam's book amen then the devil doesn't have enough rubbing compound Amen to rub your name off the book it's impossible amen so the devil can't undo what God has already done Hallelujah that should really increase our faith I think so it doesn't matter what troubles we go through hardship whatever the devil tries to put down our throat saying you'll never overcome you say no hold on my name's uh written in glory there is a name that's written down in glory and it's mine I know the author of my story and he's mine Hallelujah I am his and he is mine Amen to them we can stand on every god-given promise of God and we can realize we don't have to put up with what the devil wants to put upon us no but our faith will subdue kingdoms now I'm not talking about subjunct National kingdoms I'm talking about subduring demon kingdoms I mean spiritual wickedness in high places amen we have a power tonight and you do yourself right now I mean the faith that can subdue their Kingdom I mean whatever the Devil comes to do against you you can kick him back down to Hell from whence he came Hallelujah I happen to believe it I think our face should be rugged it should be Burly Faith amen it's not compromising faith we should press every battle amen why because God has given us every Divine promise Hallelujah amen see Jarius got to a point because his um daughter was sick you know the doctors couldn't couldn't help her anymore but then he he knew that there was a man that God lived in his name was Jesus however he knew that it was a God that he read in the in the Scrolls had stepped out of History was now living in this man so he decided amen because remember he had a lot of pressure going on here's the rule of the synagogue Jesus wasn't locked in his circles anymore but so he had to come to a point see initially his faith was hindered by what he thought what his worried people would think of him see what will my family say what will my colleagues say what will the chief Rabbi say in what will the high priest say when the news gets to him and all those things see his faith was hindered by fear but then he got to a point where he realized Nothing's Gonna help my child unless I let my faith loose amen that my faith can take over not my reasoning not my worries not my fears but my faith amen and that's the same see that's what we've got to do when we get see what kind of an action now is the time to go into action yeah what kind of an action let your faith loose I mean so don't let fear your faith don't worry about what your own house will say you get to Jesus I mean you've got trouble in your life you get to Jesus you have a need in your family you get to Jesus amen don't stop at nothing till you get to Jesus amen what is he he's just a prayer away see we shouldn't put up we should not put up with the Devil this is just how life is and they'll grow out of this patch and whatever more no who said God can interrupt anything but he's looking for you to call him on the scene that that so God can interrupt the situation yeah me times to think well they're just gonna go that trajectory of life and that's it who said who said you know faith can turn someone around amen The Prodigal Son came to himself in the pig pen we understand that what happened how did he come to himself brother I said the angel Lord came down to the pigment he came to his right mind what did that the faith of the father praying Hallelujah Hallelujah so you know we yo faith see we have the faith already oh one day we'll get this no it's here now I'm happy amen amen the faith that you used for your own salvation amen you repented you're baptized in his name you received the Holy Ghost That kind of Faith now you use that faith for your family for your friends for your loved ones the Philippian jailers that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thine and thy house shall be saved see many times brother Brown would say you know we tell people what not to do and we fail to tell people what to do well what is that what what do you do then believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and none in thy house shall be saved amen amen believe for your house right the same faith that you used to get saved that he gave you now apply it to your family apply it to your house believe actively for your house don't just don't be patented no I don't believe we're a bunch of passive people I believe we're active right I'm looking at very active Christians here I mean don't put up with nothing they're not they're not sitting in a trench somewhere but they're gung-ho they're charging forward Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at a group of people I believe I'm looking at you and and I believe there's a you might think I don't feel that way about you know forget what you feel about yourself you know Gideon was hiding threshing weed in secret but God said you're a mighty man of Allah amen that's what you really are my mighty man or woman of faith Hallelujah praise the lord we can press the battle tonight we don't have to be discouraged at all Hallelujah we can be encouraged you know God can God can use our trials to bring Deliverance to others that's right amen there was a there was a young um there was a Hallelujah young sister there at the youth can't win Christy and I were there in Canada and she couldn't eat barely anything since she was just a little girl you know many things she was free of you know free of all kinds of things just couldn't eat anything bad um tummy cramps and then be okay she'd go off one thing and then bet you get bad tummy craps to be another thing and just there was like no real answer what was wrong with her and she came up for prayer but then for well before that she'd be praying at home because her her siblings had made no move towards God at all and she is so burdened for them and she was you know calling out and asking God to touch them and so one night um brother Chris at the um Camp you know he um he gave an altar call and then so she came forward and her siblings came forward and they were coming to pray for her and she said I'm sick of this I want to be able to eat anything this is not you know this is not right so so we just started or praying for her her siblings were praying for her too and she said she just felt all the bloating going and she said she literally felt hurt intestines be rewired and then after that she could eat anything and it's been over a year she can sell it anything but then her siblings came to the Lord in those meetings they didn't would make any move towards god brother they raised their hands praised God they were totally her brother she said it's a totally different person now I mean so many times he can be a hardship in life but God sure he wants to answer that prayer but God uses that to bring others in as well because really what's the greater blessing eternal life for the siblings or now I can eat everything yeah but God just goes beyond really what we really expect doesn't he isn't he wonderful I remember you see what happened she turned her faith loose and God answered her prayer Hallelujah for herself and for her siblings I think it's amazing thing amazing Hallelujah that but but that's what we should do we shouldn't just say well I guess this is just how life is going to be I saw who said amen God has given us so many promises in his word I think we should lay hold of every single one of them amen and we shouldn't Retreat we shouldn't surrender we shouldn't give up amen we should push the battle why because God's given us Faith to subdue all things Hallelujah he sits here in Mark 11 24 therefore I said to you what things however ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them amen do you believe when you pray do you believe I'm going to receive what I'm asking for Hallelujah Matthew 18 19 again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that yeesh that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them so if two if two of you shallow ground Earth touching anything anything's everything hey amen you think about it oh what can I ask for well if it's in here and even if it's not in here but it's according you know but it doesn't contradict the word you can ask for it yeah but you've got to be in agreement got to be in unison one heart we agree together amen God this is my promise this is my need remember and it doesn't matter what state you think you're in see you know why does the devil try and push us in the picture all the time he says yeah but what about you I said no but what about our God what about the one who redeemed us remember he became sin did I become the very righteous of God in Christ isn't that what the Bible says it means it doesn't matter what we are going through in our Humanity that's actually irrelevant what Covenant has God made with you yes sir Hallelujah because remember it's just like when you know Moses Moses was told by God you know if you during a certain battle thing against the amalekites or someone as long as his hands are up loud win that's it right so the so the condition of Victory wasn't actually based upon how well the soldier of Israel were fighting it wasn't yeah yeah it wasn't it wasn't based on how fit they were how strong they were you know how much armor they had on how sharp their swords were the condition of victory was Moses hands were raised amen if his hands were raised they were winning if his hands went down they were losing now Jesus amen because remember this is a sign of victory Hallelujah said now Moses Moses was a type of Christ we understand that amen so now when the shadow passed away and then now the reality Jesus himself Came Upon the scene I mean his hands were nailed up I mean for an eternal sign of Victory amen that everything amen remember it's not the condition of the soldier that dictates Victory it's the condition of the hands of the master amen as his his hands were nailed up on Calvary what to give us complete Victory I'm in complete victory over every enemy not just to win half a battle not just to win a bit of a battle but to win a battling completeness that every enemy is dead upon the ground under your feet Hallelujah but the condition of Victory is not you it's what he has done amen if you keep looking to him you'll win if you look yourself you'll lose Hallelujah hey man we've got absolute victory tonight hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right friends amen it's not your condo how strong you think you are in faith no it's where his hands are and his hands were lifted up Hallelujah hey what did he say it is finished I'm in the victory is one now we can just walk on a bit amen Victorious tonight Hallelujah amen aren't you glad for that tonight amen the weekend we can pray amen we don't have to put up with the devil's nonsense why because faith is our victory amen the faith you have right now I one day I'll get there no no you've got it now you got the faith now you see it's like a common weed next time you go well if you go look at my garden you'll see all the weeds he said he's sprouting everywhere that's what faith is like in your life it's everywhere but you've got to take it put it in the blood and apply it yeah amen whatever whatever you have need of tonight you say well you know 90 years time or it's got to be this way because you don't know the length of the process no forget that it can be right now amen let your faith disrupt amen the Order of Things oh look it's like you know you know Lazarus the order of things for Lazarus was his body ordered right and it would be gone but the faith of the Son of God brought him out of the Grave into your Healthy totally strong well-body what happened that Faith disrupts disrupted death amen Faith Can disrupt unbelief hallelujah what a stronger unbelief or faith faith wins every time hallelujah amen see you can believe not just for yourself but for your house for someone else I mean he can pray until the enemy loses hold off that person yes right you don't have remember we walk by oh wait I've still got a scripture see walk by faith and not by sight let's just read this one if I can remember the amen let's go to Second Corinthians 4. and then we'll just finish with it he said so this is second Corinthians four and seven I didn't want to be long tonight we're full of faith follow the Holy Ghost you're full of faith who's got the Holy Ghost tonight you're full of faith Hallelujah repeat after me I'm full of faith because the Lord's in me I'm more than an overcomer through Christ that strengthens me do you feel better after saying that see see we believe therefore we speak right so if you believe it you should confess it now but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of uh and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body the way which liver always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifested our mortal flesh so then death worketh in us but life in you we have the same Spirit of Faith according it as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak that's why it's so important if you believe the word speak the word amen you're feeling down you're questioning your Christian walk take every promise of God what God has made you and speak it amen well where to start take it take the book of Ephesians and change the us and we to me and I am and quote it either you're going to stand in the mirror and quote it to yourself yeah you'll find things will change gloominess will leave unbelief will go because while you're quoting the promises of God that God has made to you amen it's not just anyone else it's to you he's made the promises amen he died that you'd receive every Redemptive blessing in this book Hallelujah that you would receive it oh what do I have to do to earn it no you just got to receive it well how do you receive it you just choose to believe it it starts with a decision say what he said is about me amen thank you Lord amen doesn't have to be a big Thunderbolt lightning time you just choose and you might ah this is mine I believe it now and we having the same Spirit I'm just going to repeat that verse 13 and we're having the same Spirit of Faith according as is written I believe and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us also by Jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes at the abundant grace might uh might through the Thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of God for which cause we faint not for thou outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction yeah every trial in life falls under this category I'm not I'm not downplaying what anyone's going through but this is the category heading it goes under light affliction now let's see the expiry date of this thing which is but for a moment I like that a moment worketh for us oh it's doing something worker for us are far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory see faith can look at any trial and it will say this is exactly what it is this is a light Affliction amen it is but for a moment and it's working for me are far more upsetting and eternal weight of Glory that's what that's what faith says about a trial hey man amen praise God so whatever trials you have put it under this category and say let's do it this is actually working on my behalf it's not here to destroy me grind me into the ground and make me nothing no it's to work a far more exceedingly uh it's working for us or for me I like to make the word personal working for me are far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we not look at while we look not at things which are seen but things which in are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal while we walk by faith and not by sight Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at people who walk by faith they have you have the sixth sense right that Faith that's in you can subdue kingdoms can tear Satan's kingdom down right can can get every promise of God can bring Deliverance can bring healing can bring peace of mind amen can bring joy unspeakable full of Glory can take away gloominess away can cast it away I mean as far as yeast is from the West
