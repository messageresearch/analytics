[49:51] hey man I think we could praise the Lord
[49:53] because of that hey man he's watch all
[49:56] our sins away oh God I like to remind
[49:59] the devil there too my sins are gone
[50:01] demon amen hallelujah amen praise the
[50:04] Lord let's um thank you musicians thank
[50:06] you brother Isaac thank you praise the
[50:08] Lord let's go to First Corinthians 15
[50:10] again we're just going to reread the um
[50:12] scripture I just want to continue from
[50:14] Wednesday and then we're going to read
[50:16] First Corinthians 15 1 to 4. I mean then
[50:19] we're gonna go to Matthew 9 20 to 22
[50:23] just a bit of a context here
[50:25] amen who's excited for Camp praise the
[50:29] Lord so just a reminder that there's no
[50:30] midweek service here on Wednesdays we
[50:32] come here looking for service well
[50:34] they'll be packing up the sound stuff so
[50:36] maybe you can give a service if you want
[50:37] to help out but
[50:38] um so we won't have a service but keep
[50:40] this um camp in prayer and
[50:43] um and also the Wednesday after camp we
[50:45] won't have a service either because
[50:46] we're putting everything back in So
[50:47] First Corinthians 15 and verses one to
[50:50] four uh moreover brethren
[50:52] I declare unto you the gospel which I
[50:54] have preached unto you which also ye
[50:56] have received and when you stand by
[50:59] which also ye are saved if you if you
[51:02] keep in memory that which I appreciate
[51:04] unto you unless you have believed in
[51:06] vain fry delivered unto you first of all
[51:09] that which I also received how that
[51:11] Christ died for our sins according to
[51:13] the scriptures and that he was buried
[51:15] and that he rose again the third day
[51:17] according to the scriptures I like that
[51:20] how the impossible repeat according so
[51:22] Jesus just didn't do things haphazardly
[51:24] and the prophecies weren't written after
[51:26] he did them but before the time and he
[51:28] fulfilled them amen and go Matthew 9 20
[51:32] to 22 and then you can have your seats
[51:34] here
[51:36] I mean Matthew 9 20 to 22
[51:40] um says here's about the woman with the
[51:42] blood issue for 12 years here we can see
[51:44] and says and behold a woman which was
[51:47] diseased with an issue of blood 12 years
[51:49] came behind him attached to him of His
[51:51] Garment for she said within herself if I
[51:54] may but touch His Garment I'll be made
[51:56] whole but Jesus turned him about and
[51:59] when he saw her he said daughter be of
[52:01] good Comfort thy faith has made the
[52:03] whole and the woman was made whole that
[52:06] from that hour amen praise the Lord

[53:58] we thank you so much and we love you in
[54:00] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[54:03] you friends you may have your seat so I
[54:05] want to
[54:06] continue on from Wednesday I was
[54:07] thinking about how Jesus would would uh
[54:10] how he did these things according to the
[54:12] scripture and that the Apostle Paul
[54:13] would would repeat this phrase twice
[54:16] here because he's wanting the people to
[54:17] see that at the life of the Lord Jesus
[54:20] Christ was a fulfillment of scripture it
[54:22] wasn't just a haphazard life where you
[54:24] know he tried to do some political coup
[54:26] and start a new movement and die to
[54:28] death and maybe thought well someone
[54:29] would you know believe on me after I'd
[54:31] died or you know some people think that
[54:33] he didn't even die on the cross but he
[54:35] went and lived in India and died there
[54:36] and all this kind of nonsense but no he
[54:38] didn't do those things he purchased our
[54:41] Salvation on Calvary he was the Lamb of
[54:43] God that would take away the sin of the
[54:44] world and he fulfilled over 300
[54:47] prophecies in his lifetime and we know
[54:50] that as he is here to fulfill the word
[54:52] or he was he is here to fulfill the word
[54:54] because he's still the same God today
[54:55] fulfilling his word he has placed us
[54:57] upon the Earth to fulfill his word as
[54:59] well now you think about this woman with
[55:01] the blood issue where she would have no
[55:03] doubt heard many stories of of Mighty
[55:06] prophets of old and you know no doubt
[55:08] you would have heard the story of of
[55:10] Elijah where where the um whether where
[55:13] the woman's um son uh uh you know the
[55:15] widow woman's son would die and then you
[55:18] know Elijah would would stretch himself
[55:20] out upon the child three times it says
[55:22] in First Kings 17 and he cried unto the
[55:25] Lord said Lord my God I pray thee let
[55:27] this child's Soul come back into him
[55:29] again and that and that child was raised
[55:31] from the dead so you're the physical
[55:33] touch of the Prophet would actually
[55:34] Raise A Man from the dead and then when
[55:37] you know years later after after the one
[55:39] who continued on the ministry of Elijah
[55:41] Elisha that same anointing Came Upon
[55:44] Elisha and then after he was dead and
[55:46] buried where where men would be packing
[55:49] packing a dead man it was a battle time
[55:51] and you know they threw him into the
[55:53] simple core of Elisha and that man as he
[55:56] has let down when he touched the bones
[55:57] of Elijah he came back to life again
[55:59] what a what incredible situation that
[56:01] would have been and here's your friend
[56:02] maybe you're carrying your companion and
[56:04] your broken hearted he's dead and you
[56:06] just got to bury him quickly because
[56:07] there's trouble around you and you lower
[56:09] his body into the Sepulcher but as soon
[56:11] as he touches that bottom of that simple
[56:12] girl comes back to life and you know I
[56:15] believe that that there's going to be
[56:17] people come to Camp who are dead but
[56:18] they're gonna not stay dead they're
[56:20] gonna but they may be spiritually dead
[56:22] and sins and trespasses but when they
[56:23] leave camp they're gonna be alive
[56:24] because they're going to be touched by
[56:26] the quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[56:29] answer no no doubt she would have you
[56:31] know maybe known about these stories and
[56:34] she would have thought you know she
[56:35] began to realize from hearing the
[56:36] testimonies of the Lord that that same
[56:39] life that was in the prophets was in him
[56:41] and so she began to think well by
[56:43] contact a boy could be raised and a dead
[56:46] man could come back to life again and so
[56:48] so no doubt if she could just Touch the
[56:50] Hem of His Garment you know she could be
[56:52] made whole because she had this issue of
[56:54] blood for 12 years and every doctor
[56:56] couldn't help her every remedy every
[56:58] every life hack on the internet some
[57:00] kind of medical thing that you know
[57:02] change of diet whatever it may be it
[57:04] couldn't help her but then she began to
[57:07] realize that if if if God is still God
[57:09] Amen and she could and you know the
[57:12] thing is about a Believer is they can
[57:13] equate what God did in the past if they
[57:15] see the same thing done today they
[57:17] realize the same God is alive today
[57:19] where it takes actually the grace of God
[57:21] to open her eyes to realize that
[57:23] prophecy is in fulfillment right in
[57:25] front of us that's why it's so you know
[57:27] we should so appreciate the Lord
[57:29] brightening our eyes on this day where
[57:31] where where the ministry of brother
[57:33] Branham was the ministry of Elijah to
[57:35] return our hearts back to the original
[57:36] faith of the fathers and that it was a
[57:38] restoration of the Bible as a
[57:40] restoration of the word it wasn't
[57:41] another movement it wasn't another Bible
[57:43] we don't follow another Bible we do not
[57:45] have another testimony of Jesus Christ
[57:47] like the Mormons do we have the
[57:49] scripture restored back to its rightful
[57:51] place and we'll come into that again
[57:53] soon but you know brother Brown would
[57:55] would would dramatize this woman here
[57:57] before she touches the Lord you know he
[58:00] says one morning while sitting out as we
[58:01] would think on the porch with her little
[58:03] fingers trembling trying to do a little
[58:05] crocheting or knit uh or or knitting and
[58:09] she looked down there there's a little
[58:11] noise taking place down at the seaside a
[58:13] little boat pushed into the Willows and
[58:15] she happened to look she was sitting
[58:16] there thinking now all my money is gone
[58:18] what will I do next see probably be put
[58:21] out of the home the mortgage has done
[58:22] took that we don't even have food to eat
[58:25] or nothing else and I can't get no
[58:26] relief and it was probably the darkest
[58:28] hour she had ever seen and about that
[58:31] time the little boat pushed in and Jesus
[58:33] come along she goes down to the river
[58:35] with a little trembling body and just
[58:37] remember because Jesus come every devil
[58:39] at hell will try and keep you away from
[58:41] him right just to come to a church or
[58:43] come to Camp doesn't mean you're going
[58:44] to get the victory the Lord's there but
[58:46] every devil is going to try and Ward you
[58:48] off on the promise of God but you're
[58:49] going to push through every devil push
[58:51] her every unbelief all mine battles I
[58:53] remember the first time I ever set foot
[58:56] in the message Church there was a voice
[58:57] saying to me leave walk out there's
[58:59] nothing here go out of here I never had
[59:01] that problem in the Pentecostal church I
[59:03] never had that problem with an Anglican
[59:04] Church abortion School a Presbyterian
[59:06] Church at another boarding school I
[59:08] never had those troubles in charismatic
[59:10] churches but when I came among the truth
[59:11] the devil was on my shoulder saying
[59:13] leave there's nothing here you don't fit
[59:15] here you're not welcome this and I just
[59:17] told them I'm not leaving you leave amen
[59:19] amen see but you gotta see every devil
[59:21] in hell will try and keep us from the
[59:23] promise of the word he'll try and keep
[59:24] you away from it that's right but you
[59:27] might hear the message but the devil
[59:28] will sit right on your shoulder and say
[59:30] don't listen don't you listen don't you
[59:32] listen but you don't believe him he said
[59:34] whosoever will come and drink from the
[59:36] Waters of Life freely the Devils even
[59:39] say don't listen to him he's a he's of
[59:41] the devil so if he can't get you to
[59:44] leave out and try and make you
[59:45] disbelieve what you're hearing that it's
[59:46] actually of the enemy and the little
[59:48] woman got down to where Jesus was coming
[59:50] up and the people rallying around him
[59:51] the poor and so forth and there stood
[59:54] the priests and all the great leaders of
[59:55] her religion and they are making fun of
[59:57] and they said oh you're the one who
[59:58] heals the sick are you well we've got
[1:00:00] plenty of sick let's see you heal them
[1:00:02] well you're the one who raises the dead
[1:00:04] are you we've got a graveyard full up
[1:00:06] here let's see you raised him he never
[1:00:08] paid he never even paid a bit of
[1:00:12] attention to them he just walked on he
[1:00:14] had one thing to do and that was the
[1:00:16] thing that God showed him to do nothing
[1:00:18] less or nothing more I like that he just
[1:00:21] did exactly what the father showed him
[1:00:22] to do and I believe we are in the and
[1:00:25] can be in the same condition like that
[1:00:27] amen amen that we only do that whether I
[1:00:29] believe that we can come to a place and
[1:00:31] I believe because of the baptism of the
[1:00:33] Holy Ghost that we can live such a life
[1:00:35] that we can have the same testimony
[1:00:36] Jesus had we says I always do that which
[1:00:39] pleases the father
[1:00:40] amen because we're made of the same
[1:00:42] material he's made of by the baptism of
[1:00:44] the Holy Ghost right so when the
[1:00:46] Christian gets to that place without lay
[1:00:48] aside and not listen to all the Scandal
[1:00:50] and stuff that said and all the going on
[1:00:52] and have one motive that's to do the
[1:00:55] will of God that God sent you to do
[1:00:56] there'll be a different day and a
[1:00:58] different church amen if we can get to a
[1:01:01] place where we don't sit in a song
[1:01:03] service or stand and look around what
[1:01:04] everyone else is doing that we don't get
[1:01:06] to you know you know you know we get
[1:01:08] Beyond wondering what everyone else is
[1:01:09] thinking about us and wonder about you
[1:01:12] know is this right or wrong or whatever
[1:01:13] more if we can get past all of that
[1:01:15] stuff and actually say we're here for
[1:01:17] one purpose it's not to please my
[1:01:20] neighbor it's not to try and outshine
[1:01:22] the person next to me in front of me or
[1:01:23] behind me but we're comfortable for one
[1:01:25] purpose to worship the true and living
[1:01:27] God see true worship comes where you
[1:01:30] forget about everyone around you amen
[1:01:32] you don't care about what everyone else
[1:01:33] is doing you can have a conference with
[1:01:36] God in your seat by yourself and that's
[1:01:38] all that matters it don't matter what
[1:01:39] everyone else thinks and what everyone
[1:01:41] else is doing we're here to worship God
[1:01:43] I'm here to worship God myself
[1:01:46] amen amen so so if we get that one
[1:01:49] motive that's to do the will of God what
[1:01:51] God sent you to do there'll be a
[1:01:53] different day in a different church and
[1:01:54] I pray we have a different day in a
[1:01:56] different church that we go higher than
[1:01:57] we've been amen we're not here to
[1:01:59] Plateau right we're here to ascend
[1:02:02] amen here he she walked down to this
[1:02:05] crowd and Jesus was walking along in a
[1:02:07] slow steady walk and people were running
[1:02:09] up to him saying are you the prophet are
[1:02:11] you this are you that say how about
[1:02:13] coming over here and doing something for
[1:02:14] me see people just want God to do things
[1:02:16] for them that's the wrong motive
[1:02:19] amen when you come in humility with a
[1:02:21] need that's a different thing but people
[1:02:22] say hey come and do this if you're
[1:02:24] really God if this is really true do
[1:02:25] this for me
[1:02:26] you know that's not how it works let me
[1:02:28] see you perform a miracle we would love
[1:02:30] you to turn the waters to Wine here's a
[1:02:32] jug full of it now I read this last
[1:02:34] night I thought man I've heard this so
[1:02:35] many times I'd like to have some they
[1:02:37] say it's good one make this wine let me
[1:02:39] see how it tastes see people say yeah I
[1:02:42] want to see him turn water into wine do
[1:02:43] that now if you're the same if he's
[1:02:45] really in you I want to see what it
[1:02:46] tastes who's heard that kind of stuff
[1:02:49] hey man he never even raised his head he
[1:02:51] just kept walking on that makes me love
[1:02:53] him the prophet said amen you know it
[1:02:55] takes it see it takes little pity it
[1:02:59] takes little bitty Petty people to fuss
[1:03:01] and argue a big man never pays any
[1:03:03] attention to nothing like that
[1:03:05] Christians don't notice what the world
[1:03:07] says if they want to say anything they
[1:03:09] want to they've got see but but they're
[1:03:12] too big to notice these little bit bitty
[1:03:15] things they just keep moving on just
[1:03:18] going on the little woman thought now
[1:03:20] it's the only hour I'll ever see in my
[1:03:22] last opportunity the only opportunity
[1:03:24] I've ever had and I truly believe if I
[1:03:26] can just touch the him the Garment of
[1:03:28] that man I'll be made well he says what
[1:03:31] a faith and what a Time
[1:03:33] so so she had seen what she read in the
[1:03:37] Old Testament I heard in the Old
[1:03:38] Testament was living now in front of her
[1:03:40] and she realized if I could just touch
[1:03:42] him I'll get the same results I'll get
[1:03:44] healing I'll get deliverance from this
[1:03:45] issue so she zeroed into her need and
[1:03:48] the fact that the one that she could the
[1:03:51] one that could heal her was was was in
[1:03:53] her presence and she didn't care about
[1:03:55] what everyone else was doing what
[1:03:56] everyone else was saying who cares about
[1:03:58] people's opinion honestly I I just I'm
[1:04:01] just interested in the word of God and
[1:04:03] what he has to say I think that's far
[1:04:05] more valuable than people's opinion a
[1:04:07] lot of opinion kept people out of the
[1:04:09] arka Noah's day we just watched The
[1:04:11] Sight and Sound play on Noah you know
[1:04:13] there's a lot of opinions about things
[1:04:14] the people swayed people even out of the
[1:04:16] Ark it was dramatized but I believe that
[1:04:18] would have happened but you see so but
[1:04:20] it was all man's opinion but Noah had
[1:04:23] the word of the Lord and thing is it
[1:04:25] wasn't just a different idea and let's
[1:04:26] build an ark no God really did Flood The
[1:04:28] World God really did bring bring
[1:04:31] Deliverance see it wasn't just something
[1:04:32] to do in different religion let's have a
[1:04:35] let's make a boat no it was God's
[1:04:37] provided way and so is the word of God
[1:04:40] and this hour God's provided way but it
[1:04:43] produces what it says it will produce
[1:04:45] now some people think if they could only
[1:04:47] go back into Jesus day they could be
[1:04:49] like the one with the well Touch the Hem
[1:04:51] of His Garment and they'll be made whole
[1:04:53] but we can do the same amen amen because
[1:04:56] the Bible tells us in Hebrews 4 we have
[1:04:59] he says for we have not in high priest
[1:05:00] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:05:02] of our infirmities but it was in all
[1:05:04] points tempted like we are yet without
[1:05:06] sin so let us therefore come boldly unto
[1:05:08] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[1:05:11] mercy and find Grace to help in time of
[1:05:14] need so we have a high priest that can
[1:05:17] be touched by the feeling of our
[1:05:18] infirmity see brother Brown many times
[1:05:20] when the discernment was going on people
[1:05:22] back in the audience he'd call them out
[1:05:24] show them what they're thinking about
[1:05:25] what they've been praying about their
[1:05:26] needs were and he would ask the question
[1:05:28] who did she touch who did he touch you
[1:05:30] know they're 20 feet 30 feet from me
[1:05:32] he's saying they touch the high priest
[1:05:34] but what was happening the high priest
[1:05:36] Jesus Christ himself stepped under that
[1:05:38] Prophet vessel and revealed what their
[1:05:40] needs were so by faith they are touching
[1:05:42] the high priest but the high priest was
[1:05:44] on the platform revealing himself
[1:05:45] through a redeemed son of man I mean
[1:05:48] redeemed son right amen
[1:05:50] Hallelujah that's why that would happen
[1:05:52] now God loves to see his word become
[1:05:55] material
[1:05:56] he never intended it just to be fairy he
[1:06:00] never intended this just to be a
[1:06:01] theoretical Christianity is not
[1:06:03] theoretical Christianity is practical
[1:06:05] it's a reality it's a living word right
[1:06:08] it's not just Theory it's never meant to
[1:06:09] be just a lecture hall kind of a walk
[1:06:11] but it's an everyday
[1:06:12] practical walk amen somebody loves to
[1:06:16] see his word become material now the
[1:06:17] devil hates to see God's word become
[1:06:19] material he hates to see it become flesh
[1:06:21] but we have thousands of years of record
[1:06:24] of every time the devil tries to stop at
[1:06:26] manifesting he failed Hallelujah so he
[1:06:29] will continue to fail and stop in God's
[1:06:31] program but God's program is going to
[1:06:33] continue on Amen to weaken our full
[1:06:36] confidence what he has promised in this
[1:06:37] day is going to happen amen it's going
[1:06:39] to happen right on time on schedule yes
[1:06:42] under budget hallelujah it's all going
[1:06:45] to happen just fine right so we don't
[1:06:47] need to be worried
[1:06:49] as the Rapture gonna happen absolutely
[1:06:51] it's gonna happen
[1:06:53] and he has called you to be part of that
[1:06:55] rapture amen not just to be a bystander
[1:06:58] in the world but actually to be called
[1:07:00] up higher amen so he loves to see his
[1:07:03] word become material now he would say in
[1:07:05] Isaiah 55 and 10 for as the rain cometh
[1:07:08] down in the snow from heaven and
[1:07:10] returneth not hither but watereth the
[1:07:11] Earth and maketh it to for uh to bring
[1:07:14] forth and Bud that it may give sea to
[1:07:16] the sower and bread to the eater so
[1:07:18] shall my word that goeth forth out of my
[1:07:21] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[1:07:23] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:07:25] please and it shall prosper and the
[1:07:27] thing we're unto I sent it for you shall
[1:07:29] go out with joy and be led with peace
[1:07:31] and mountains and Hills shall Break
[1:07:33] Forth before you into singing and all
[1:07:35] the trees of the field shall clap their
[1:07:37] hands so his word is not going to return
[1:07:38] to him void or empty he has not spoken a
[1:07:41] word just for it too just to Fritter off
[1:07:43] into nothing and not materialize but the
[1:07:46] same faith that he said let there be sun
[1:07:48] moon and stars and there is as the same
[1:07:51] Faith he said there'll be a bribe
[1:07:52] without spot or wrinkles washed in the
[1:07:54] blood of the Lamb Maiden has image I
[1:07:56] mean overcoming the devil walking out of
[1:07:59] this H triumphant amen that same that
[1:08:02] same Faith you had to create all things
[1:08:03] to the same faith when he spoke that
[1:08:05] word and prophesied of a bride being
[1:08:07] Victorious Made In His Image amen so his
[1:08:10] word shall not return to him void so
[1:08:12] there's not going to be he doesn't have
[1:08:14] a plan B he doesn't need a plan B God
[1:08:17] doesn't need Plan B he just has a plan a
[1:08:19] and as plan a is his perfect will of his
[1:08:22] worth and he's gonna find someone
[1:08:25] that's gonna fulfill it you know it's
[1:08:28] interesting what we read there in Isaiah
[1:08:30] 55 is his word shall not return unto him
[1:08:32] void that was after you know that was
[1:08:35] after Isaiah who spoke that had already
[1:08:38] prophesied that the Virgin shall
[1:08:40] conceive so she so so he had already
[1:08:42] spoken under inspiration maybe he wrote
[1:08:44] it down maybe a scribe wrote it down I'm
[1:08:46] not sure how that exactly worked but you
[1:08:48] know the inspiration came and he spoke
[1:08:50] that forth and so that that that was
[1:08:53] already been released upon the Earth and
[1:08:56] God is saying here that this will not
[1:08:57] return to him void now of many problems
[1:08:59] every promise applies in this way right
[1:09:01] so every promise will not return to him
[1:09:03] void it will accomplish that which you
[1:09:06] know every word it's going to accomplish
[1:09:08] that which I please and it shall prosper
[1:09:10] in the thing until I sent it see but you
[1:09:12] see when he said a virgin shall conceive
[1:09:14] he knew exactly the
[1:09:16] woman that was going to do it in his
[1:09:19] mind when he sparked the Thrive he knew
[1:09:21] it would be Mary
[1:09:22] he knew that she would be a spouse to
[1:09:24] Joseph he knew that the Roman government
[1:09:26] would be controlling Israel right I
[1:09:28] don't even know if the Romans were a
[1:09:30] thing back when Isaiah spoke that but
[1:09:31] they were a thing in God's mind they he
[1:09:33] knew the kingdom would come right and so
[1:09:36] so all those things were in God's mind
[1:09:38] you know he realized they would happen
[1:09:39] and so no doubt when many many Jewish
[1:09:43] believers who believed I was had to be a
[1:09:45] prophet when they heard that prophecy
[1:09:46] they thought my daughter's going to be
[1:09:48] the one but it was time locked for a
[1:09:50] certain season and in that season it
[1:09:52] came to pass remember everything of the
[1:09:53] world had to be in its position Rome had
[1:09:55] to be in charge of of Israel the scribes
[1:09:58] and Pharisees had to be there you know
[1:10:00] all the you know you know there had to
[1:10:02] be Mary had to be there the right woman
[1:10:04] had to be there he didn't have maybe a
[1:10:06] selection he had won and it's the same
[1:10:08] thing with your you and I
[1:10:11] he knows exactly you know if we could
[1:10:13] just look at look past the curtain of
[1:10:15] time and see our theophany you know
[1:10:18] theophany bodies if we can look past the
[1:10:20] curtain of time and the law could
[1:10:22] actually send us a video or a photo of
[1:10:24] this is your seat at the wedding supper
[1:10:25] table I think that would change a lot of
[1:10:27] things I think a lot of issues of life
[1:10:29] would just be blown away all Troubles of
[1:10:31] life would be put to one side all what
[1:10:34] this person says and this person thinks
[1:10:35] and what I think about this and blah
[1:10:37] blah blah blah that blah would be gone
[1:10:39] that would be muted because you realize
[1:10:41] actually I have a I've got a homo
[1:10:43] beyonder on the other Shore amen and we
[1:10:46] but we need to realize when the Holy
[1:10:48] Ghost comes into our lives and he
[1:10:50] changes us according to his word what is
[1:10:52] he telling you you have a home over here
[1:10:55] yes Hallelujah yes sir amen because it's
[1:10:57] the grace of God that leads us to
[1:10:59] repentance even so it's you know even
[1:11:01] just to repent and give your life
[1:11:02] completely to God you can say I've got a
[1:11:04] home Over Yonder I'm on my way
[1:11:07] Hallelujah is it just is what he says it
[1:11:09] just repentance no a true repentance
[1:11:11] gives a filling of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:13] amen so we do not follow cuddling the
[1:11:16] cunningly devised Fables right but
[1:11:19] that's the power of God God Reveals His
[1:11:21] word and he makes it material
[1:11:23] amen now he would say in Isaiah 43 and
[1:11:26] and we're going to come down to a
[1:11:27] special uh verse and this but we'll come
[1:11:29] down to it he says Isaiah 43 and 10 yeah
[1:11:31] my Witnesses saith the Lord and my
[1:11:33] servant
[1:11:34] whom I have chosen that ye may know and
[1:11:37] believe me and understand that I am he
[1:11:39] before me there is no God formed neither
[1:11:42] shall there be after me I even I am the
[1:11:45] Lord and besides me there's no savior
[1:11:47] amen I have declared and have saved I
[1:11:50] have showed that when there was no
[1:11:52] strange God among you therefore ye are
[1:11:54] my Witnesses saith the Lord I am God
[1:11:57] yeah before the day was I am he and
[1:12:01] there is none that can deliver out of my
[1:12:03] hand I will work and who shall let it no
[1:12:06] there's none that can deliver out of his
[1:12:08] hand so if you're in his hand the devil
[1:12:11] can't get you out of his hand I mean
[1:12:13] there's no one stronger than our father
[1:12:14] he's stronger than them all so it
[1:12:16] doesn't matter what weapon he forms
[1:12:18] against you against your children you've
[1:12:19] got to have faith no they're coming they
[1:12:21] don't have a choice in the matter
[1:12:22] they're coming home they're coming to
[1:12:24] the lord they're going in a Rapture I
[1:12:26] think we should have that kind of rugged
[1:12:27] face amen so so there's none that can
[1:12:30] deliver out of his hand I will work and
[1:12:33] who shall let it thus saith the Lord
[1:12:35] your Redeemer the Holy One of Israel for
[1:12:37] your sake I have sent to Babylon and
[1:12:40] brought down all their nobles and the
[1:12:41] Chaldeans whose cries and the ships I am
[1:12:44] the Lord your Holy One the creator of
[1:12:46] Israel your king
[1:12:48] thus saith the Lord which maketh the way
[1:12:50] in the sea in a path in the mighty
[1:12:52] Waters which bringeth forth The Chariot
[1:12:54] in the horse and the Army and the power
[1:12:55] they shall lie down together they shall
[1:12:57] not rise they are extinct and they are
[1:13:00] quenched as toe and that toe actually
[1:13:03] means a flax remember ye not the former
[1:13:06] things neither consider the things of
[1:13:08] old there's things we need to not
[1:13:10] remember of our past life
[1:13:13] right if we're a new creature in Christ
[1:13:15] we're a new creature in Christ if those
[1:13:17] things keep coming back into your mind
[1:13:18] you say thank God I'm not that person no
[1:13:20] more right because the deer wants to try
[1:13:22] and pull us back by our past but we
[1:13:24] should just say no I'm not that person
[1:13:26] anymore sure that person may have done
[1:13:28] that but that person died there's a new
[1:13:30] person living in this building
[1:13:32] Hallelujah so don't even consider things
[1:13:34] of old now this next verse is very
[1:13:36] special because when sister Vanessa
[1:13:37] received the Holy Ghost at our first
[1:13:39] ever service there's a tongues
[1:13:40] interpretation and the interpretation
[1:13:42] was behold I do a new thing and it shall
[1:13:45] spring forth shall you not know it I
[1:13:47] will even make a way in the wilderness
[1:13:49] and rivers in the in the desert sister
[1:13:51] Brawn he spoke this forth now people say
[1:13:53] well it shouldn't just be a repetition
[1:13:55] of scripture but hold on if that
[1:13:57] scripture is a prophecy and it applies
[1:13:58] to a place that's all well and good amen
[1:14:01] so so this was a promise the lord gave
[1:14:03] us that he will do a new thing amen amen
[1:14:06] and it and now it shall spring forth so
[1:14:08] it's not going to be in the it's going
[1:14:09] to be right now
[1:14:10] amen shall you not know it I'll even
[1:14:12] make a way in the wilderness and rivers
[1:14:14] in the desert now it's very interesting
[1:14:16] when you look at the singer new thing
[1:14:18] because some people couldn't stumble and
[1:14:20] think well how can God
[1:14:22] do a new thing because you think a new
[1:14:24] thing is something different now that
[1:14:26] word new new thing doesn't actually mean
[1:14:28] something different it means a
[1:14:30] restoration of what was there or what
[1:14:32] should be there so that word new it
[1:14:35] means a fresh new thing but the root
[1:14:37] word of that Hebrew word it means
[1:14:40] causatively to repair renew or rebuild
[1:14:43] so he says I'm gonna I'm gonna do a
[1:14:46] rebuilding I'm gonna do a renewal I'm
[1:14:50] gonna do a repair
[1:14:52] so when something's repaired or rebuilt
[1:14:54] now this is not rocket science but when
[1:14:56] something's repaired or rebuilt it's a
[1:14:58] restoration work
[1:14:59] yo it's like something breaks You Mend
[1:15:02] the broken pieces you glue it back
[1:15:03] together you fight restore missing parts
[1:15:05] you know you paint it you do whatever
[1:15:07] you need to do to restore it back to its
[1:15:09] former glory now the only way man can
[1:15:12] ever be restored is not a
[1:15:15] facelift it's not a paint job it's not a
[1:15:18] new set of clothes right it is not
[1:15:20] turning a new Leaf like a New Year's
[1:15:22] resolution but the only way a man can be
[1:15:25] restored or repaired or renewed is by
[1:15:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the
[1:15:30] soul of man that changes the nature of
[1:15:32] man from unbelief to Faith that's the
[1:15:36] only way someone can be renewed there's
[1:15:38] no uh this is not a Reformation Center
[1:15:40] this is not seven steps to becoming a
[1:15:42] better Christian all right there's not
[1:15:44] seven steps to a happier life or
[1:15:45] whatever no there's only one well
[1:15:48] repentance be baptized name of Jesus
[1:15:50] Christ ambitious and you shall receive
[1:15:51] the gift of the Holy Ghost and a true
[1:15:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost will ank you
[1:15:56] into the word that you will live
[1:15:57] according to the scripture not your own
[1:15:59] ideas right so now the only way we can
[1:16:02] ever be renewed or repaired is to
[1:16:04] receive the Holy Ghost which transforms
[1:16:06] us and then we walk in newness of life
[1:16:08] that we now walk above sin right the
[1:16:12] things which once dragged us down don't
[1:16:14] drag us down no more but we live above
[1:16:16] it it may try and drag us back down
[1:16:18] because we're still in these bodies
[1:16:19] right we're still you know receiving the
[1:16:22] Holy Ghost does not does not remove us
[1:16:24] from Temptation that's right right it
[1:16:26] doesn't put a force field around us that
[1:16:27] will no longer tempt a member the Lord
[1:16:29] Jesus the fullness of the god here
[1:16:31] bodily dwells in him but he was tempted
[1:16:33] on All Points like us but yet without
[1:16:35] sin so he was pulled just like we're
[1:16:38] pulled Temptation different things and
[1:16:40] every day yeah yeah the prophet says he
[1:16:42] was tempted by sexual Temptation he was
[1:16:45] tempted on every point because he was a
[1:16:46] man but yet he was without sin so he
[1:16:49] understands when we're tempted certain
[1:16:51] ways he understands
[1:16:53] amen so receiving the Holy Ghost does
[1:16:55] not remove Temptation out of your life
[1:16:57] but it gives you overcoming power over
[1:16:59] that Temptation amen that's why you can
[1:17:01] yield to the Holy Ghost and he'll give
[1:17:03] you overcoming power
[1:17:05] praise the Lord I'm so aren't you glad
[1:17:06] for that I mean I'm so thankful that we
[1:17:10] just don't you know we don't just
[1:17:11] continue on with unbelief but we
[1:17:13] actually can have a newness of life and
[1:17:15] where God comes and lives in us and
[1:17:17] changes our whole being
[1:17:19] but now when you think of rebuilding or
[1:17:21] or repairing you know my mind went to
[1:17:23] Elijah on Mount Carmel after you know
[1:17:26] it's amazing after the um you know
[1:17:28] prophets of Baal did their thing Hey it
[1:17:31] said that he repaired the altar of the
[1:17:33] Lord that was broken down so he did not
[1:17:35] build a new altar he repaired the one
[1:17:37] that had been abandoned had been
[1:17:39] forgotten had been left to fall into
[1:17:41] disrepair he rebuilt it He restored it
[1:17:44] the Lord did a new thing he did a
[1:17:46] rebuilding he did a renewal of a place
[1:17:49] of worship for God so he so he rebuilt
[1:17:51] the altar of the law that had fallen
[1:17:53] down so now there were Stones there see
[1:17:56] he didn't go get new stones but he took
[1:17:58] the stones that were formerly part of
[1:17:59] the Altar and rebuilt them so the altar
[1:18:02] was restored now we know an altar is a
[1:18:04] place of sacrifice and altar is a place
[1:18:07] of communion right many times you know
[1:18:09] like like
[1:18:11] abrahammy you know put some sacrifices
[1:18:13] out and God came down and burnt them up
[1:18:15] and spoke to him you know that was
[1:18:17] that's what would happen when an altar
[1:18:18] would would be built the right kind of
[1:18:20] altar that God would come down and
[1:18:21] commune with his people so now this
[1:18:23] rebuilding of the altar now these Stones
[1:18:25] now are are Revelation Stones now if we
[1:18:28] jump forward to this day you know
[1:18:30] there's been 2 000 years nearly of when
[1:18:32] the altar of God has been abandoned
[1:18:34] right it was rebuilt on the day if it
[1:18:36] was built on the day of Pentecost right
[1:18:38] with the doctrine of the Apostles and
[1:18:40] the prophets and the result remember the
[1:18:42] result of a real altar is the Firefall
[1:18:44] yes right the the sacrifice just doesn't
[1:18:47] sit there and look pretty and say what a
[1:18:48] great sacrifice but the fire of God
[1:18:50] comes down and consumes the offering
[1:18:53] that's the results see see people can
[1:18:55] argue all that they want about the
[1:18:57] message being wrong and conspiracy
[1:18:59] theories about brother brown but what
[1:19:00] does the message produced amen
[1:19:03] I can't speak for the rest of the
[1:19:05] message world but for myself I see the
[1:19:07] fire of God fall I see the word put on
[1:19:09] flesh I see I see this Bible goes from
[1:19:12] print form into flesh that's what I see
[1:19:14] so you know to me that kind of throws
[1:19:16] every argument out of the way because
[1:19:18] what does it pro juice
[1:19:21] Hallelujah so Elijah the you know the
[1:19:24] prophets of bowel can be saying all they
[1:19:25] want but Elijah was rebuilding the altar
[1:19:27] now as I said the that item that that
[1:19:31] that altar was there on the day of
[1:19:32] Pentecost and the fire fell yeah but
[1:19:35] then it was neglected and the because
[1:19:38] the church went into eventually into a
[1:19:40] dark age but God said I will restore
[1:19:43] so now there were all these Stones there
[1:19:45] that were put Revelations were slowly
[1:19:48] put some weren't quite right somewhat
[1:19:49] you know because there was a lot of
[1:19:51] loose ends and man's ideas trying to
[1:19:53] probe into the scripture which God
[1:19:55] blessed them for it right but in the
[1:19:57] evening time because that's when Elijah
[1:19:59] rebuilt the altar at the evening time
[1:20:01] the Elijah here in the evening time
[1:20:04] right he came and he took Revelation
[1:20:06] stones of the word
[1:20:08] amen he took the stone of the Oneness of
[1:20:11] God Amen but he's not one like your
[1:20:13] finger because your finger only has one
[1:20:15] manifestation
[1:20:17] right I remember when brother Pedro did
[1:20:18] that it's just like a light bulb moment
[1:20:20] because your finger can only do this
[1:20:23] that God's one but not like your finger
[1:20:25] because your finger only can only do one
[1:20:26] manifestation the God can come in
[1:20:28] Angelic form he came as Melchizedek
[1:20:31] right he appeared as an angel many time
[1:20:33] going through Pillar of Fire by now
[1:20:35] Cloud by day that was God right he came
[1:20:38] and you know as the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:40] the Lamb of God take away the sin of the
[1:20:42] world as a as the son of David right and
[1:20:46] then that same Jesus Christ changed form
[1:20:48] and now dwelt in the in The Believer all
[1:20:51] the way down through the ages of the
[1:20:52] Holy Ghost amen so now
[1:20:56] here we are here take so so take that
[1:20:58] kind of Revelation Stone it had been
[1:21:00] there originally he put it back in the
[1:21:02] altar and then he took baptism in the
[1:21:04] name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:06] that's the only there's only one form of
[1:21:07] baptism it's not two or three or
[1:21:09] whatever you know this is not like a
[1:21:11] smorgasbord religion amen you know you
[1:21:14] can go to Subway and you can build your
[1:21:16] sandwich exactly how you want it based
[1:21:18] on the ingredients to try and please
[1:21:20] everyone this is not how it works with
[1:21:22] the word there's one sandwich
[1:21:24] if I put it currently there's one
[1:21:25] sandwich you got to take all the
[1:21:27] fillings you can't throw away the
[1:21:29] jalapenos or the Cucumber or the lettuce
[1:21:31] or no you're gonna have the whole word
[1:21:33] from cover to cover and just eat the
[1:21:35] maps too because you'll find your way
[1:21:36] around right so so he took all these all
[1:21:39] these stones
[1:21:41] the way to dress right the way to treat
[1:21:43] your family actually a full surrender
[1:21:45] surrendered her
[1:21:46] every Revelation and then he put the
[1:21:49] stones there a lot of those stones had
[1:21:52] to be dusted off like baptism sure they
[1:21:54] had a revelation you know the
[1:21:56] anabaptists came out that adults should
[1:21:57] be baptized but they were still
[1:21:58] sprinkling adults a lot of dirt and mud
[1:22:00] was on that stone
[1:22:02] then finally it was immersion there was
[1:22:04] a bit of dirt taken off but there was
[1:22:05] fully restored to what it should be a
[1:22:07] lot of dirt had to be taken off
[1:22:08] then it was placed there
[1:22:10] but then now the sacrifice had to be put
[1:22:12] on the altar
[1:22:13] yes and you come to find out when God
[1:22:15] puts Revelation stones in your heart you
[1:22:18] begin to realize actually the sacrifice
[1:22:20] is me
[1:22:21] you know
[1:22:23] it's all very easy to say Well when
[1:22:25] someone else does it
[1:22:26] you know it's just like I remind you
[1:22:28] yeah it's like reminding that story
[1:22:29] there's a guy with a you know on a
[1:22:31] tightrope and he's got a wheelbarrow no
[1:22:33] first he walks along the tightrope
[1:22:35] people are watching him and he's walking
[1:22:36] on the tightrope like those people are
[1:22:38] cheering him
[1:22:39] and then he gets a wheelbarrow and he
[1:22:41] walks along people like wow that's so
[1:22:42] amazing
[1:22:43] and then he says no who wants to get in
[1:22:45] the wheelbarrow
[1:22:47] the crowd really silences down because
[1:22:49] they have all confidence that he can do
[1:22:52] it but then now they put themselves in
[1:22:54] the equation
[1:22:55] but in order to get into the wheelbarrow
[1:22:57] and get safely across you've got to
[1:22:58] fully surrender to the one pushing the
[1:23:00] Barrow right you've got to fully
[1:23:02] surrender to the one pushing the Barrow
[1:23:03] because if you imagine if you're sitting
[1:23:05] there and you're panicking you'll start
[1:23:07] jerking like this because you know he's
[1:23:08] going to stabilize you and you start
[1:23:10] doing this what's gonna happen you're
[1:23:11] gonna you're gonna fall off but if
[1:23:13] you're fully surrendered to him you just
[1:23:14] sit there as calmly as can be as still
[1:23:16] as you can be right and then a lot and
[1:23:20] then the Lord can take you across that's
[1:23:21] exactly what you've got to do with the
[1:23:23] word you can't try and stabilize it or
[1:23:26] even just watch it go across you've got
[1:23:28] to get into it you've got to fully
[1:23:30] identify yourself with the word and the
[1:23:32] only way the law can take across whereas
[1:23:34] with a full surrender a full confidence
[1:23:37] and trust that the one pushing the
[1:23:39] Barrow he's professional he's done this
[1:23:42] before
[1:23:44] hallelujah how many how many tens of
[1:23:47] millions or of people has he taken
[1:23:49] across the chasm of death
[1:23:51] but you've got to trust him
[1:23:54] Hallelujah
[1:23:55] amen so then now then now the stones
[1:23:59] were placed but now the sacrifice now I
[1:24:01] said all that about the wheelbarrow
[1:24:02] because it's easy when you say yeah
[1:24:03] praise the Lord but now you're the
[1:24:05] sacrifice and you've got to be willing
[1:24:08] we have to be willing to lay aside
[1:24:11] everything to allow whole bodies as a
[1:24:14] sacrifice brother man would say this and
[1:24:16] God's provided a way Elijah said now get
[1:24:19] everything together give me a stone here
[1:24:20] to represent each of them put the
[1:24:23] sacrifice upon it walked out there he
[1:24:24] said now Lord let it be known that thou
[1:24:26] art the god of Heaven I am your prophet
[1:24:28] and the fire Begin to Fall brother when
[1:24:30] the methodists can forget that they're
[1:24:32] the only people on the Earth and the
[1:24:34] Baptists they're the only the
[1:24:35] Pentecostals they're the only we can get
[1:24:37] all ourselves together and say Lord send
[1:24:39] the fire we're going to get somewhere
[1:24:41] that's right when the one that's
[1:24:43] Pentecostal the turn is Pentecostal
[1:24:45] three in this Pentecostal fiveness
[1:24:46] Pentecost and all of them can get their
[1:24:48] heads together when all the methodists
[1:24:50] can forget about sprinkling and whether
[1:24:52] you're baptized or whether you're poor
[1:24:53] or whether you do this and everybody get
[1:24:55] together and forget about all them
[1:24:57] little old things and say God send the
[1:24:59] power everything will take care of
[1:25:01] itself
[1:25:02] get the heart right with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:04] and the Holy Ghost will take care of the
[1:25:07] rest of it I mean how many times do we
[1:25:09] get so caught up in things which really
[1:25:12] people just need the Holy Ghost
[1:25:14] and God will take care of the rest of it
[1:25:16] yes sir amen I believe that that kind of
[1:25:19] a Revival get God's provide away roll
[1:25:21] one stone up of Salvation I believe that
[1:25:23] roll up the stone of speaking in tongues
[1:25:25] I believe that roll up the stone of
[1:25:27] interpretation I believe that roll up
[1:25:29] the stone of of Divine Healing I believe
[1:25:31] that Brethren get ready for the fire now
[1:25:33] that's sure now I'm just going to forget
[1:25:35] all about our theology Lord I'm just
[1:25:38] rolling up these Stones I'm gonna lay
[1:25:40] myself right across it oh Lord burn me
[1:25:43] up amen he will do it don't worry he'll
[1:25:46] get you I like that he'll do it don't
[1:25:48] worry he'll get you see when we're just
[1:25:51] ready to forget about all our own
[1:25:52] theology
[1:25:53] what kind of theology well I've got to
[1:25:56] be good enough for long enough therefore
[1:25:57] I Merit the Holy Ghost
[1:25:59] oh you know
[1:26:00] yo some people are so caught in a
[1:26:03] legalistic cycle
[1:26:04] and then the more legalistic they get is
[1:26:06] because the more struggling they become
[1:26:08] and the more they push down on one
[1:26:09] another
[1:26:10] we shouldn't be that way just get rid of
[1:26:12] that kind of theology it's just come to
[1:26:13] the Lord amen
[1:26:15] amen a pardon must be received as a
[1:26:17] pardon rise you've got to receive the
[1:26:19] Lord you've got to receive his pardoning
[1:26:21] grace what do I need to do to Merit it
[1:26:23] just receive it yeah
[1:26:26] amen
[1:26:28] you just lay yourself right across and
[1:26:30] say oh Lord burn me up he'll do it don't
[1:26:32] worry he'll get you see after Elijah
[1:26:35] rebuilt the altar Lord and he and he put
[1:26:37] the sacrifice on exactly as the Lord
[1:26:39] said watered and everything then the
[1:26:42] fire fell and his final prayer he said
[1:26:44] Lord I've done all this according to
[1:26:46] your word
[1:26:47] amen so so God God's word became
[1:26:50] material you could say that Elijah
[1:26:53] rebuilt the altar according to the
[1:26:54] scripture amen amen because it was it
[1:26:57] wasn't written down but it was a
[1:26:58] revelation to him and it wasn't contrary
[1:27:01] to the written word amen so so the fire
[1:27:03] fell now that was the proof that was the
[1:27:06] proof that Elijah was Vindicated by God
[1:27:09] right it wasn't the fact that the
[1:27:11] prophets of Baal couldn't call Fire
[1:27:13] it was that God Amen Elijah and when God
[1:27:18] amends Our Lives
[1:27:21] with his presence with a moving in power
[1:27:24] with his hand of Deliverance with
[1:27:26] healing with restoration with love a joy
[1:27:29] a real peace with an anchoring faith it
[1:27:31] won't move from the word when he comes
[1:27:33] in in amens and that's what I'm looking
[1:27:35] for even in a service like this or at
[1:27:37] camp that God will come in and amen and
[1:27:40] bring souls to the Altar and bring
[1:27:41] deliverance and bring healing and mend
[1:27:44] hearts and fill with the Holy Ghost and
[1:27:46] break a glass ceiling the Devil's Tomb
[1:27:48] he tries to keep on us and we can't
[1:27:49] praise God Amen I am believing that he's
[1:27:52] gonna am in his words
[1:27:54] Hallelujah I'm believing that that's
[1:27:56] what I'm looking for
[1:27:57] amen the supernatural element is so
[1:27:59] important
[1:28:01] Hallelujah so now the proof that Elijah
[1:28:04] in the end time restored the altar or
[1:28:06] the Revelation stones of the word back
[1:28:08] into the altar of the Lord as that the
[1:28:11] fire fell
[1:28:12] just like it did on the day of Pentecost
[1:28:15] Hallelujah the same baptism of the Holy
[1:28:18] Ghost they received we received amen now
[1:28:21] that is the proof that it is it is thus
[1:28:23] saith the Lord according to the
[1:28:24] scripture because the same Holy Ghost
[1:28:26] 2000 years ago that fell there now comes
[1:28:29] and falls upon us and we are led by the
[1:28:32] spirit of God just like they were
[1:28:34] amen see on the day of Pentecost when it
[1:28:36] was fully come they were with one Accord
[1:28:38] in one place yes
[1:28:41] yes now one Accord means to be with one
[1:28:43] mind to be with one Accord with one
[1:28:46] passion
[1:28:47] I like that with one passion one burning
[1:28:49] desire amen that's what they had they
[1:28:52] wanted to see the word fulfilled now
[1:28:54] they did not just sit there and say well
[1:28:56] it's been eight days now I'm sure we
[1:28:57] feel different because by faith we
[1:28:59] receive it right let's go out and start
[1:29:01] our ministry maybe Andrew said that but
[1:29:03] Peter said no hold on we've got to
[1:29:05] receive power I can't go out and preach
[1:29:08] the same way I came into this room
[1:29:09] because when when I came into this room
[1:29:12] the smallest you know pressure came on
[1:29:14] me of some woman by a fire and they said
[1:29:17] aren't you one of them and I deny the
[1:29:18] Lord three times I need a change in my
[1:29:20] heart so I can go out and face far
[1:29:22] bigger Giants than just them
[1:29:24] amen so that he said no there's got to
[1:29:26] be something really happened and that's
[1:29:28] why when the day of Pentecost fully came
[1:29:30] now with one heart one mind one Accord
[1:29:33] that was one passion now we read earlier
[1:29:36] that if we could have one motive that's
[1:29:38] to do the will of God then what God sent
[1:29:40] you to do there'll be a different day
[1:29:42] and a different church I mean so if we
[1:29:44] could just have that one motive Lord I
[1:29:46] want to see you live I want to see Souls
[1:29:48] come to the kingdom I want to see demons
[1:29:50] cast out I want to see a stability
[1:29:52] coming to lives obviously a piece of
[1:29:54] puzzle understanding rest in the hearts
[1:29:56] of man amen that people will come into a
[1:29:58] true spiritual relationship with the
[1:30:00] Lord Jesus Christ amen and live
[1:30:02] according to his word that's what we
[1:30:03] want to see you may think well I need
[1:30:05] direction in my life just make that your
[1:30:07] passion and he'll take care of
[1:30:09] everything else
[1:30:10] where should I go what job should I have
[1:30:12] just make that your passion and he'll
[1:30:14] take care of everything else amen
[1:30:15] because Jesus said seek ye first the
[1:30:17] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:30:20] all these things shall be added to you
[1:30:21] so we need to seek his kingdom and his
[1:30:24] righteousness amen so it should be our
[1:30:26] passion now I'm not saying these things
[1:30:27] like it's not your passion but I was
[1:30:28] wondering let's have a rally before we
[1:30:30] have camp
[1:30:31] because I believe this is going to be
[1:30:33] the greatest Camp that's going to strike
[1:30:34] the Earth that's just how I feel that's
[1:30:36] the expectation because God has taken
[1:30:38] her expectation Times by a billion and
[1:30:41] poured himself out greatly amen so you
[1:30:43] know but there's going to be opposition
[1:30:44] at Camp the devil doesn't like us having
[1:30:47] holy ghost film meetings the devil
[1:30:49] doesn't like us having times of
[1:30:50] Deliverance he doesn't like being cast
[1:30:52] out he wants to keep a dampner on the
[1:30:54] place to stop breakthroughs from from
[1:30:56] happening
[1:30:59] but our God has determined there's going
[1:31:01] to be a breakthrough because he wants to
[1:31:02] see his people free right but it's the
[1:31:04] same thing as brother Bram saw that
[1:31:06] vision of a people and they were in
[1:31:08] prison and they had like cancerous gross
[1:31:10] on them and things they couldn't see
[1:31:11] properly but yet they were Believers but
[1:31:13] things that caused him to go into this
[1:31:15] prison maybe it was maybe it was a bit
[1:31:16] of resentment maybe a misunderstanding
[1:31:18] maybe some pain came in or people got
[1:31:20] too familiar with one another and yo
[1:31:22] your misunderstandings happened hurts
[1:31:24] common that can put you in a prison yeah
[1:31:26] right but then you know
[1:31:29] he was called to deliver the people and
[1:31:31] the Lord came and stood by him and the
[1:31:33] Lord told him you deliver the people
[1:31:35] he said how can I break these bars and
[1:31:37] these things they're so big he just said
[1:31:39] well House of Hell give way to the name
[1:31:41] of Jesus Christ and every prison bar
[1:31:43] came tore loose and everyone went free
[1:31:46] so if you could take that because God is
[1:31:48] you know God's plan is tied with man
[1:31:51] God's Plan of Redemption is timed with
[1:31:54] Tide with man right he could have got
[1:31:56] the moon the Sun the Stars to preach the
[1:31:58] gospel he could have just sent angels to
[1:32:00] go preach but he decided to speak and
[1:32:02] live through man that his plan would be
[1:32:05] tied to man amen just like when when
[1:32:08] Cornelius is praying in his house he's a
[1:32:10] gentile we're in Acts chapter 10. and an
[1:32:12] angel comes to him and says Cornelius
[1:32:14] your prayers your arms have come before
[1:32:15] God now he could have said now receive
[1:32:18] you the Holy Ghost Jesus is the Messiah
[1:32:20] he's died he's fulfilled the Old
[1:32:22] Testament now come and let God come and
[1:32:24] dwell on you but he said no send me into
[1:32:26] jopper and find Peter he'll tell you the
[1:32:28] way of life so God's plan is tied with
[1:32:31] man so I believe that we should see see
[1:32:34] that's why that's why to me that Vision
[1:32:36] that brother bam saw the prison is so
[1:32:38] scriptural because God says you deliver
[1:32:39] them yeah because God wants to use your
[1:32:42] lips he wants to use your voice he wants
[1:32:44] to use your prayer he wants to use your
[1:32:46] life I mean to sit captives free
[1:32:49] Hallelujah not to bind people down but
[1:32:51] to liberate people I mean that's why
[1:32:54] it's so important when we come to
[1:32:55] Campbell's service you know we can
[1:32:56] create an atmosphere around us that God
[1:32:58] steps down but if we keep looking at
[1:33:00] people around us and what's going on
[1:33:02] we're distracted yeah right but if we
[1:33:04] realize no I'm here to commune with my
[1:33:06] maker the one the redeemed me the one
[1:33:08] that saved me he set me free and now
[1:33:10] I've come to worship Him Hallelujah and
[1:33:12] then now that body comes together what
[1:33:14] can God do
[1:33:15] oh baby it is unlimited he is Unlimited
[1:33:18] in his potential
[1:33:20] amen says that question now say we are
[1:33:23] sent here to be a lighthouse to be a
[1:33:25] Haven of Rest For People amen that that
[1:33:27] that that Rivers would flow in a desert
[1:33:30] amen that God would do a new thing he
[1:33:32] would rebuild people's lives to be a
[1:33:34] Living Sacrifice to himself for his
[1:33:36] glory amen you may think I'm looking for
[1:33:39] direction in my life well make your
[1:33:40] focus God and God will take care of the
[1:33:42] rest of your life amen whatever you do
[1:33:44] and wherever this goes people watch this
[1:33:46] you know many places become part of a
[1:33:48] body of Believers to accomplish that
[1:33:51] don't be a person by yourself don't just
[1:33:53] be part of a fellowship by proxy and say
[1:33:55] bye no no put your time in put your
[1:33:58] effort in put your energies in put your
[1:34:00] personal presence there
[1:34:02] I meant so important you know someone's
[1:34:04] presence there a testimony can actually
[1:34:06] hold back people going into idolatry
[1:34:10] the elders that would outlived Joshua
[1:34:13] were living Witnesses of God's
[1:34:15] deliverance and bring them into the land
[1:34:16] and the Bible says after they died then
[1:34:19] Israel went to idolatry so just those
[1:34:21] testimonies those time-tested memorials
[1:34:24] maybe they're 80 90 years old you know
[1:34:26] but they're but just their presence
[1:34:29] and their testimony kept Israel on the
[1:34:32] course
[1:34:34] amen she said I don't make a difference
[1:34:36] you make a world of difference
[1:34:38] amen you're you're impact all of your
[1:34:42] impact as a as a great impact for the
[1:34:44] kingdom of God never think that you're
[1:34:46] not important the devil tries to tell
[1:34:48] you you're not important but you're the
[1:34:49] apple of God's eye you're his beloved
[1:34:52] you're his redeemed Ransom wonderful
[1:34:54] bride his wife
[1:34:56] amen
[1:34:57] so that's why we should always gather
[1:34:58] and be part of a group of Believers and
[1:35:00] I'll say if you need to move well you
[1:35:02] move make it happen now
[1:35:05] see a Wilderness here it's by
[1:35:07] implication it means a desert
[1:35:10] that's amazing when you think of a
[1:35:11] desert there's no food there's a famine
[1:35:13] and now uh Amos was saying Amos 8 11
[1:35:16] behold the day come say the Lord God
[1:35:18] that I'll send a famine in the land not
[1:35:20] a famine of bread nor a thirst for water
[1:35:22] but of hearing the words of the Lord but
[1:35:24] let's just backtrack Jesus said out of
[1:35:26] your bowels out of your belly shall flow
[1:35:28] rivers of Living Water
[1:35:30] right so if you if you have the Fountain
[1:35:33] of God within you the Holy Ghost you'll
[1:35:35] be a blessing to one another right you
[1:35:37] won't need to be petted baby to Long
[1:35:39] push no no there'll be the life of God
[1:35:41] will flowing out of you you'll be an
[1:35:43] oasis where people come into your
[1:35:45] presence maybe they're all frazzled and
[1:35:47] stressed and troubled but after they've
[1:35:49] taken a drink a bit of Fellowship they
[1:35:51] walk their afresh renewed hey man
[1:35:54] Revitalize that that's how we should be
[1:35:56] for one another right amen so we're not
[1:35:58] just having a drink we're here that the
[1:36:00] Lord would give out
[1:36:02] praise the Lord shall we drink because
[1:36:04] we've got to drink and grow but there's
[1:36:05] your out of vibe Valley Shuffle rivers
[1:36:07] of Living Waters amen no let's just jump
[1:36:10] forward again so he says I'll send a
[1:36:12] famine in the land he says behold the
[1:36:14] days come saith the Lord that I'll send
[1:36:15] a famine in the land not a famine of
[1:36:18] bread nor the thirst for water but of
[1:36:19] the hearing of the words of the Lord so
[1:36:22] not a famine of Bibles or religion or
[1:36:26] churches but hearing the words of the
[1:36:28] Lord now what is the words of the Lord
[1:36:30] that's inspired word of God so there'll
[1:36:33] be a famine in the land not for bread or
[1:36:35] thirst of water we have food and
[1:36:37] abundance
[1:36:38] okay we live like Emperors I think even
[1:36:41] Julius Caesar or whatever the greatest
[1:36:43] Kings there are upon the Earth they eat
[1:36:45] nothing in bed while we eat
[1:36:47] you know it used to be in England mate
[1:36:49] oh I think it actually it kind of still
[1:36:50] is but you know Medieval Times they'd
[1:36:53] have some salt the Kings and stuff they
[1:36:55] think man we've really got something
[1:36:57] just some salt and we can get sea salt
[1:37:00] we can get Himalayan salt what kind of
[1:37:03] grind do you want you want fine grind
[1:37:05] coarse grind we can get Murray River
[1:37:07] salt flakes we can get all different
[1:37:09] kinds of salt and they just have
[1:37:10] probably one kind of sea salt so much
[1:37:12] and you think of the flavors we can eat
[1:37:14] within the types of meat and the kinds
[1:37:16] of vegetables and things man we just
[1:37:19] and if we don't get it within a couple
[1:37:21] hours we begin to complain
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:24] wait so there's not a famine for food
[1:37:28] but hearing the words of the Lord
[1:37:32] but he said in a desert in a wilderness
[1:37:36] I'll bring waters in the desert
[1:37:39] amen now
[1:37:47] right if it stopped raining here long
[1:37:50] enough the Hutt River will be just the
[1:37:53] be the Hutt River bed because there
[1:37:55] won't be any water in it right if you if
[1:37:58] you know if you stop the rain the water
[1:37:59] stops there's no more flowing of river
[1:38:01] right
[1:38:02] amen I'm sure that's not shocking to
[1:38:05] anyone right so so if there's if there's
[1:38:08] rivers in the desert there's got to be
[1:38:10] rain somewhere
[1:38:11] now the Lord promised us the former and
[1:38:14] the latter rain now now I'm saying these
[1:38:16] things now I trust this is not abstract
[1:38:17] to you because you're living in the rain
[1:38:20] it's not just naturally it rains here
[1:38:22] most of the year right it's spiritually
[1:38:24] there's rain
[1:38:26] hallelujah amen he said I will give you
[1:38:29] the former and the letter Reign now now
[1:38:31] the former reign in the Hebrew means a
[1:38:34] teaching Ray so so there'd be a there'll
[1:38:37] be a teaching go forth and then the
[1:38:39] latter rain is the Harvest or the
[1:38:41] quickening rain now it's amazing where
[1:38:43] brother Brown was saying um
[1:38:45] spoken worthy original seat he'd say
[1:38:47] that oh Roberts and Billy Graham would
[1:38:48] sew for the World Council of churches
[1:38:50] and they have yeah that was back in
[1:38:53] early 60s I think he said that
[1:38:55] amen but then he said that that that the
[1:38:57] ministry of Malachi 4 would sow for the
[1:39:00] bride
[1:39:01] amen so if they have served for the
[1:39:03] World Council churches that's what
[1:39:04] they've produced and what does this
[1:39:05] message produced the bride of Christ
[1:39:08] Christ and bride form amen so he says be
[1:39:11] glad you then you children of Zion and
[1:39:13] rejoice in the Lord your God for he has
[1:39:15] given you the former Reign moderately
[1:39:17] and he will cause to come down for you
[1:39:19] the rain the former and the latter rain
[1:39:22] in the first month now if you think of
[1:39:24] the first month when they came out of
[1:39:27] Egypt Moses was told this is the
[1:39:29] beginning of months for you this is the
[1:39:30] beginning of days I mean so it was tied
[1:39:33] in the first months was tied in with the
[1:39:34] Exodus yeah Hallelujah so now if you've
[1:39:37] come under the blood the blood's been
[1:39:40] applied to your body your spirit and
[1:39:43] your soul so the spirit of God has been
[1:39:44] applied to all three Realms not just
[1:39:46] your body for healing not just your
[1:39:48] spirit for deliverance but it's he's
[1:39:50] come down and dwelt in your soul the
[1:39:52] blood's been applied before the blood
[1:39:54] can be applied you become one with your
[1:39:56] sacrifice
[1:39:57] every part of it not just the ribs not
[1:39:59] just the cutlets not just the shanks but
[1:40:01] the whole thing so not just the bits of
[1:40:04] the word that oh that sounds nice you
[1:40:06] know we all love the power and the glory
[1:40:07] and the resurrection but what about the
[1:40:09] likeness of his sufferings hey man what
[1:40:12] about to be a reproach for the cause of
[1:40:14] the word what about going beyond the
[1:40:16] camp of our society of our culture of
[1:40:19] our our dares and going unto him
[1:40:21] what if you go yo if you become a
[1:40:24] reproach for the cause of the word that
[1:40:25] means people will speak bad about you
[1:40:27] you know the Bible says whoa Jesus said
[1:40:29] woe unto you if all men speak good of
[1:40:31] you yeah
[1:40:33] I just want to be a people pleaser you
[1:40:35] can't we can't please everyone you can
[1:40:36] either please people or please God I'll
[1:40:38] just please God because he's got a
[1:40:40] heaven to go to he's got real good
[1:40:42] benefits in his life eternal life policy
[1:40:45] hallelujah it's worth serving him
[1:40:48] Hallelujah for now
[1:40:51] Hallelujah so you see it so so this is
[1:40:54] the beginning of months so if the blood
[1:40:55] has been applied
[1:40:56] you become one with the word
[1:40:58] he says I'm gonna give you the former in
[1:41:00] the latter rain in the first month so
[1:41:03] that means it will start raining when
[1:41:05] you become one
[1:41:06] with the word you won't just be living
[1:41:08] off localized rains that was a good
[1:41:11] service but the rest of the week you're
[1:41:12] dry no you walk out of these doors it's
[1:41:14] raining
[1:41:16] you read the word there's a teaching
[1:41:18] comes and it quickens to you and then
[1:41:20] the and then the and then the latter
[1:41:21] rain quickens the word and makes it come
[1:41:24] to life in your life Hallelujah even
[1:41:27] just when you read the word and maybe
[1:41:28] you read in the scripture created me a
[1:41:31] clean heart oh Lord and renew a right
[1:41:32] Spirit Within Me it quickens to you
[1:41:35] and then you really pray that and God
[1:41:38] changes you
[1:41:39] oh look that's a quickening
[1:41:41] Hallelujah
[1:41:43] amen so it's raining all the time
[1:41:46] Hallelujah
[1:41:47] you say well I'm in a desert you know
[1:41:50] God's in the desert too yes
[1:41:52] many times we think yeah well he's only
[1:41:54] in with his Green Pastures no he's in
[1:41:56] the desert that's right because he says
[1:41:57] I'll never leave you nor forsake me now
[1:41:59] there are some Kings one day and they
[1:42:01] decided let's go fight I think it was
[1:42:03] Moab I might have the enemy wrong but
[1:42:04] they wouldn't afford an enemy
[1:42:06] and they went for seven days in the
[1:42:08] desert and they discovered we have no
[1:42:11] water and one of the Kings said God's
[1:42:13] brought us out here today now if you
[1:42:15] read the accountant sorry I don't have
[1:42:17] it on me Second Kings in there I'll put
[1:42:19] on the WhatsApp later if someone reminds
[1:42:20] me
[1:42:22] there's no consultation of God before
[1:42:24] they go on this campaign
[1:42:25] they just said let's go fight
[1:42:28] but because they because they believe
[1:42:29] they're the children of God they think
[1:42:30] well God just tells them to do
[1:42:32] everything now you've got to wait on the
[1:42:33] Lord
[1:42:34] right and if you start and and he will
[1:42:36] direct your footsteps so start walking
[1:42:39] in a direction and he'll guide your path
[1:42:40] don't just stand still
[1:42:42] and be well should I have breakfast
[1:42:43] today well yeah you should
[1:42:45] you know but just oh why well Lord I
[1:42:47] want to have this career start walking
[1:42:49] about walk softly and he'll guide you
[1:42:52] right that's how we should be don't fall
[1:42:53] asleep on me just now now and so what
[1:42:56] happens is so so they decided let's go
[1:42:58] fight this battle there seven days in
[1:43:00] the desert yeah
[1:43:01] yeah and he and and one of the king says
[1:43:03] the Lord's brought us out here to die no
[1:43:04] they brought themselves out there
[1:43:06] they they got themselves into a spot
[1:43:08] isn't it amazing we can get ourselves
[1:43:09] into some spots we ourselves can get us
[1:43:12] there and the sooner we realize actually
[1:43:14] it was my own GPS that said turn left
[1:43:16] instead of turning right and here I am
[1:43:18] it's good to realize Lord I got myself
[1:43:20] here can you please buy your grace get
[1:43:22] me out and then say when I got the
[1:43:24] prophet and he said make the valley full
[1:43:25] of ditches because in the morning
[1:43:27] they'll be full of water
[1:43:29] Hallelujah now the reason he could say
[1:43:32] that is because that smitten Rock
[1:43:34] that followed the children of Israel in
[1:43:37] the wilderness into the promised land he
[1:43:39] was there
[1:43:40] amen the Lord is there he's here right
[1:43:42] but then sometimes there's the sand
[1:43:45] desert experience they can be
[1:43:48] superstitions culture
[1:43:51] selfishness Pride
[1:43:54] you know arrogance indifference
[1:43:56] lukewarmness it's like desert sand
[1:44:00] where once the Rock of Ages is uncovered
[1:44:02] and the water's gushing but then all
[1:44:04] those things cover them up
[1:44:06] so they were told make the valley full
[1:44:08] of ditches
[1:44:10] so they had to dig for victory it wasn't
[1:44:13] just in World War one and two trench
[1:44:14] warfare with that dick for victory they
[1:44:16] had we have to dig for victories we have
[1:44:19] to get our hands muddy on the shovel of
[1:44:22] faith and start digging out if you've
[1:44:25] got order against a brother or sister
[1:44:26] dig it out
[1:44:28] check it out have you got some super if
[1:44:30] you got fear you're not gonna make it
[1:44:31] dig it out
[1:44:33] the Lord's out perfect lamb
[1:44:35] he died for you and I am en he's our
[1:44:38] sacrifice he's our Waymaker he's our
[1:44:40] light in the darkness he's your light in
[1:44:42] the darkness he's your Waymaker right
[1:44:45] take it out you know if you've got some
[1:44:47] legalistic idea dig it out
[1:44:49] even some liberal idea well God just
[1:44:51] Winks at my sin and he doesn't get no no
[1:44:53] hold on God cares
[1:44:55] we do not we are not in the same
[1:44:57] condition as we were in the Old
[1:44:58] Testament in the Old Testament they went
[1:45:00] and sacrificed they came back with the
[1:45:02] same sinful nature now people think well
[1:45:04] God just God just you know because Jesus
[1:45:07] died I don't need to give a sacrifice
[1:45:08] and he forgives me anyway and they just
[1:45:10] wait on in their sin that's not
[1:45:11] Christianity Christianity is the life of
[1:45:14] God comes into you and gives you
[1:45:16] overcoming power they're the things you
[1:45:18] once battle with you don't battle with
[1:45:20] because you get a victory over it that's
[1:45:22] right Hallelujah isn't that what it is
[1:45:24] because he's the Christian how man has
[1:45:27] failed to build religion to try and
[1:45:29] atone for their sins
[1:45:30] Christian religion different ways of
[1:45:32] doing things but they've got to come
[1:45:33] back to the blood and let that blood be
[1:45:36] applied to their lives and change them
[1:45:39] amen aren't you glad we can have that
[1:45:41] today
[1:45:42] praise the Lord you say well I'm
[1:45:44] struggling in an era just get more of
[1:45:46] the Lord
[1:45:47] you know there's this one phrase in the
[1:45:48] New Testament he says that he'll fill up
[1:45:50] their sins away
[1:45:51] I like that it's kind of an unusual
[1:45:53] expression but he's going to fill your
[1:45:54] sins up you know fill up your sins away
[1:45:56] now just say if this was
[1:45:59] um okay this is water
[1:46:01] just say this is oil
[1:46:03] right the oil of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:06] how do you really get all the water out
[1:46:07] of this bottle
[1:46:10] you fill it up no hopefully I probably
[1:46:11] got this around the wrong way but anyway
[1:46:12] what I'm saying is
[1:46:14] you you're full of sin right full of
[1:46:16] complexes troubles pains hurts anxiety
[1:46:19] depression it doesn't belong to you it's
[1:46:23] not your portion the devil says well
[1:46:24] this is yours you know maybe you inherit
[1:46:26] it from your family or whatever more but
[1:46:28] it doesn't belong to you
[1:46:30] right so you just fill it up
[1:46:33] fill yourself up with the Holy Ghost and
[1:46:35] it will put it'll push everything else
[1:46:37] out of your life just let him push it
[1:46:40] out
[1:46:41] Hallelujah
[1:46:42] praise the Lord he'll push it all out
[1:46:45] amen let him fill up all your sins away
[1:46:47] I like that hey
[1:46:50] dig out all these things
[1:46:52] amen but then eventually they hit the
[1:46:55] rock oh there's nothing like when you
[1:46:57] make contact with the rock I mean but
[1:46:58] don't just don't just get a little bit
[1:47:00] of them keep pushing all the dirt and
[1:47:02] sand out until you totally uncover all
[1:47:05] that he is
[1:47:06] hallelujah how long have some people
[1:47:08] been digging people dig their whole life
[1:47:10] and there's always more of God
[1:47:12] but he wants you to to know him
[1:47:16] so just keep digging out take the
[1:47:18] resentment trouble comes up in church
[1:47:19] that's actually sand just sliding back
[1:47:21] down upon the rock dig it out
[1:47:23] hey man troubles come up in family you
[1:47:26] know you come to you know complacency in
[1:47:28] life whatever it is just Dig It All Out
[1:47:30] apathy and all these things though we
[1:47:32] should have a vision
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:36] it's so full of apathy well who cares
[1:47:39] you know you know brother man would say
[1:47:40] the curse of soft living yeah we can
[1:47:43] have it too good there's no drive for
[1:47:44] life there's no well the government will
[1:47:46] take care of me you know and thank God
[1:47:48] for those kind of things but don't just

[1:48:40] that's why it's so important when you
[1:48:42] look at when you're looking at someone

[1:48:44] because how they treat their families
[1:48:46] how they'll treat you

[1:49:18] to get to no actually I will I'll just
[1:49:19] be real quick okay let's go into fifth
[1:49:21] gear now what's the matter with the
[1:49:22] church today the water supply is cut off
[1:49:24] because of grumbling and doubting yeah
[1:49:26] if you'll get it if you'll get into a
[1:49:27] desert you'll find that every Bush that
[1:49:29] you come up against will perhaps have
[1:49:30] thorns and stickers on it because it's
[1:49:32] raised in a dry land without water you
[1:49:34] take the same variety of bush and put it
[1:49:36] in a moisture a land of moisture that'll
[1:49:38] be soft because there's plenty of water
[1:49:40] and you take a church that's always
[1:49:41] fussing and stewing about this is days
[1:49:44] of Miracles has passed just remember
[1:49:46] they're in a desert and out of the water
[1:49:48] now to me when he says days of Miracles
[1:49:50] have passed he's not just saying about
[1:49:52] Divine Healing he's talking about the
[1:49:54] supernatural Touch Of God that can
[1:49:56] change your life
[1:49:57] because that is a miracle you you want
[1:49:59] to see the greatest Miracle upon the
[1:50:01] earth look at someone who's got the Holy
[1:50:03] Ghost
[1:50:03] that is greater than a cancer being
[1:50:05] healed greater than the limb being
[1:50:07] restored as a transformation of a soul
[1:50:09] as the greatest Miracle you'll ever see
[1:50:13] why because that Miracle will continue
[1:50:15] until the change of the body
[1:50:18] amen praise the Lord see thank you just
[1:50:22] remember they're in a desert and out of
[1:50:23] the water and a church that's loving and
[1:50:26] humble and flexible and feels and goes
[1:50:29] with the word of God remember they're
[1:50:30] living by the fountain that never runs
[1:50:33] dry amen so if we're at church is loving
[1:50:36] now we're going to make this personal if
[1:50:37] I'm loving and I'm humble and I'm
[1:50:39] flexible and feels so not just
[1:50:41] indifferent but actually has a feeling
[1:50:42] for one another and goes with the word
[1:50:44] of God what does that mean agree and
[1:50:46] live by remember they're living by the
[1:50:49] fountain that never runs dry amen so get
[1:50:52] until you when you hit the Rock of Ages
[1:50:54] keep digging around it and the Waters of
[1:50:56] play will never end I mean so he said
[1:50:59] there'll be rivers in the deserts it is
[1:51:01] it's raining
[1:51:02] praise the Lord now the latter rain is
[1:51:04] also a harvest rain
[1:51:06] and we're living in a Harvest Time
[1:51:09] now we understand by the by you know by
[1:51:13] Nature that the grain has to be in the
[1:51:15] head of the plant mature golden and then
[1:51:18] the Harvest comes the combine comes now
[1:51:21] we're living in an hour I'm just going
[1:51:22] to read this but you remember
[1:51:24] when it went down the grain began to
[1:51:25] ripen that you find before that grain
[1:51:27] can ripen everything that's in the stalk
[1:51:29] has to be dead Hallelujah can't you see
[1:51:31] where we're standing so the life in the
[1:51:33] former parts of the plant go into the
[1:51:35] going to the grain the life is in the
[1:51:37] grain again what is it just exactly like
[1:51:39] the same grain that went into the ground
[1:51:40] the same Jesus is in Bride form the same
[1:51:44] power the same church the same thing the
[1:51:46] same word the same word sucked up
[1:51:48] through these come out here and come to
[1:51:50] a head here and all that life that came
[1:51:52] through here picked up its people now
[1:51:54] it's forming up into a head for the
[1:51:56] Rapture Hallelujah
[1:51:59] so because some people say well the
[1:52:01] grain is here so we're just going to
[1:52:02] land the prince of the Sun and there's
[1:52:03] no manifestation anymore there's no
[1:52:05] there's no leaves blowing in the breeze
[1:52:07] there's no tassels there's not great
[1:52:09] Mission work going on you know but it's
[1:52:11] just it's just it's just grain laying in
[1:52:13] the presence of the Sun
[1:52:15] no that's true we are ripening in the
[1:52:17] presence of the Sun but if you look at
[1:52:19] the original grain that first walk the
[1:52:21] earth our Lord Jesus Christ there's more
[1:52:23] manifestation in his life amen just in
[1:52:27] those few few years that are recorded in
[1:52:29] the gospel there's more manifestation of
[1:52:31] God Amen in that than than to me the
[1:52:33] entire Old Testament why because that he
[1:52:36] was all revealed in part through the Old
[1:52:37] Testament now the fullness of him was
[1:52:39] there upon the Earth so there was more
[1:52:41] manifestation of Miracles of Deliverance
[1:52:44] amen right of being yo come now of of of
[1:52:48] healing of Deliverance demons being cast
[1:52:50] out the dead being raised but the
[1:52:53] original grain lived a totally
[1:52:55] surrendered sold-out life
[1:52:58] that's it all right man yeah it's not
[1:53:01] just Miracles that we have right right
[1:53:03] I'm saying these things because you've
[1:53:05] got to look at what are we aiming to
[1:53:07] become
[1:53:08] if I say we're arrived there's nothing
[1:53:10] more there's no more Revival let's just
[1:53:12] sit back and wait then that's what we
[1:53:13] will become
[1:53:15] but but that's not what the picture says
[1:53:16] the picture says we shall be like him
[1:53:19] amen will be made in His image so if he
[1:53:22] upon the Earth was one who cast out the
[1:53:24] devil healed the sick raise the dead
[1:53:26] discern the thoughts and Tents of the
[1:53:28] heart calm the storms
[1:53:30] Hallelujah if he did fulfilled the word
[1:53:33] for his age so we will do the same but
[1:53:36] as I've said in the past the greatest
[1:53:38] Miracle to me the Lord Jesus ever did
[1:53:40] was subject himself to the word of God
[1:53:42] above his feelings as I said before yo
[1:53:46] I've seen the past that that you read on
[1:53:48] Mount Transfiguration Moses and Elijah
[1:53:51] stood there in one account he said they
[1:53:53] told him what he had to accomplish at
[1:53:55] Jerusalem so they'll go through all the
[1:53:57] prophecy of the Old Testament you'll be
[1:53:58] wounded for our transgressions they're
[1:54:00] going to pierce your hands and your feet
[1:54:01] you'll be marred more than any other man
[1:54:03] you'll be done before your accusers
[1:54:04] you'll be a sheep like led to the
[1:54:06] slaughter you'll be hung between two
[1:54:07] male factors you know you're gonna be
[1:54:09] buried all those things the sin of the
[1:54:11] world is going to be upon you all those
[1:54:13] things your your Soul's gonna be an
[1:54:15] offering for sin
[1:54:16] they preached to him the word concerning
[1:54:19] himself
[1:54:20] now he had to be our sin offering he had
[1:54:24] to go as a man
[1:54:25] no I know from my own experience when
[1:54:29] the burden of sin in your own life
[1:54:30] becomes apparent it's a big weight
[1:54:33] when you realize your own vile state
[1:54:35] that you need to be washed in the blood
[1:54:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ you need to be
[1:54:38] delivered from this burden just like
[1:54:40] Pilgrim's Progress how how John Bunyan
[1:54:42] and Spidey yeah he said there's a big
[1:54:44] burden on the on on on Christian's back
[1:54:46] and but when he went to Calvary that
[1:54:49] burden fell off
[1:54:50] now can you imagine the burden of just
[1:54:53] one is great what about a burden of the
[1:54:55] whole history of humanity
[1:54:58] that great burden of sin
[1:55:00] amen and then he'll come to a place when
[1:55:03] he's hang on Calvary cry out my God my
[1:55:05] God was thou forsaken me so he died as a
[1:55:08] forsaken sinner in your place
[1:55:11] no the greatest Miracle to me is when he
[1:55:14] was in Gethsemane
[1:55:16] and and heaven was waiting for an answer
[1:55:19] will he do it or will he not
[1:55:21] being a man he didn't want to die no one
[1:55:24] in their right mind likes pain
[1:55:26] right no one in their right mind but
[1:55:28] here's gonna be mad more than any man
[1:55:30] but yet he was so surrendered now this
[1:55:32] is the first grain
[1:55:34] and and his response was father if
[1:55:36] you're willing take this cup from me but
[1:55:37] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[1:55:40] done and he subjected his own body
[1:55:44] to the word that he had to fulfill and
[1:55:47] it wasn't glamorous it wasn't glorious
[1:55:49] it wasn't this big manifestation of
[1:55:51] power as we would think but he died mad
[1:55:55] more than the other man beaten Riven
[1:55:57] between two male factors of a broken
[1:55:58] heart rejected by his own people
[1:56:01] he's our example
[1:56:04] if he could subject himself to the word
[1:56:06] of God he said well it's my right to
[1:56:08] dress how one do what I want say what I
[1:56:10] want watch what I want yeah as a as a
[1:56:12] human being
[1:56:13] but when you become a Christian you
[1:56:15] fulfill you forfeit all of your rights
[1:56:18] and above how you feel and you fulfit
[1:56:20] them to God and let the word of God have
[1:56:23] preeminence amen
[1:56:25] amen amen that he came to a place where
[1:56:27] he'd say I only do that which pleases
[1:56:29] the father
[1:56:32] amen now we want to see God move at camp
[1:56:35] we need to be surrendered vessels for
[1:56:36] him
[1:56:37] Amy we can't come just haphazardly and
[1:56:40] arrogantly and well he's done it before
[1:56:41] he'll do it again no we should always
[1:56:43] cherish every move of God that we
[1:56:45] experience we should be appreciative
[1:56:47] every time his Spirit comes down and
[1:56:49] touches us and he speaks to our hearts
[1:56:51] and he deals with us we should never
[1:56:52] take those moments for granted right God
[1:56:55] would speak to a prophet one time in the
[1:56:57] Old Testament it was a great big massive
[1:56:58] thing how many times did he come service
[1:57:00] after service time after time you read
[1:57:02] the word you listen to the message that
[1:57:04] God speaks directly to you it's like
[1:57:06] he's sitting there in the chair opposite
[1:57:08] you and he's having a conversation it's
[1:57:10] wanting to get your attention we should
[1:57:12] cherish those things it's like the angel
[1:57:14] of God speaking to Gideon and the
[1:57:16] threshing floor or or the angel of God
[1:57:18] speaking to Samson's parents or the same
[1:57:21] as God speaking out the burning bush to
[1:57:22] Moses
[1:57:23] that's incredible things we should
[1:57:26] cherish those moments and never take
[1:57:28] them for granted
[1:57:29] you know if we really have the
[1:57:31] Revelation that we are the bride of
[1:57:32] Christ we'll be the most humble
[1:57:34] surrendered thankful people in all the
[1:57:35] world it won't make us a stuffed shirt
[1:57:37] well I'm going on the Rapture these
[1:57:39] people no we will never have that near
[1:57:41] our minds
[1:57:42] right
[1:57:44] so in conclusion
[1:57:47] it's raining if you're in a desert he'll
[1:57:50] make rivers in the desert yeah
[1:57:52] for you he'll do a new thing
[1:57:54] but let him rebuild you'll let him yeah

[1:58:00] Let the Fire Fall yes let him do it

[1:58:07] I did for years but then after you meet
[1:58:09] him you say man I wasted all that time
[1:58:12] you know you think man if only I met him
[1:58:13] earlier he called me earlier one and I
[1:58:15] know him earlier but you know and the
[1:58:18] devil always wants to paint a picture
[1:58:19] there's nothing to it you know you know
[1:58:22] you'll lose all this and it's not worth
[1:58:23] it it's more than worth
