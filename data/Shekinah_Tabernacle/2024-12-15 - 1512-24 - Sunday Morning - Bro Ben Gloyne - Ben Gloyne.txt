========================================

[Music] good morning how you all this morning good feeling happy feeling ready to praise the Lord this morning who uh who woke up early enough to hear the dawn chorus anyone I thought you would you know when I was sitting over there I thought you know if anyone's going to answer yes it's going to be you I'm a bit of a creative guy so um I got to bed just before it starts usually like I think last night I was about 3:30 I went to bed probably starts about when does it start maybe 4:00 4:30 something but you know I when I am up early enough in the morning to hear it I just it always amazes me you know that how God's made this creation and that these these birds you know they're just sitting there and then and then just When the Dawn starts to come and the light starts to to shine through the trees and begin to warm the Earth these birds just get so excited and then they just begin to praise the Lord they just sit somewhere up in a tree and they just praise the Lord they just worship I don't care which way people say that it happens and what it is I know for a fact these birds are are in the top of those trees they're worshiping God they just they're just so happy to be alive and they they just worship the Creator and they know it too they're so happy and you know they don't even know what Redemption is they don't even know what Grace is they don't even know what Mercy is and yet they can just praise God and yet here we are this morning you know we know what Redemption is we know what it's like to be lost we know what it's like to be found we we know what

[Applause] amen amen Just Praise the Lord we're just going to um slow it down and this is a new song I don't know if people have heard it before you probably have heard it you can start um playing it but it's a very um beautiful song because it's a song about really when you think about it about Redemptive love and and when we get to understand what Redemptive love really is it's the most powerful force in the whole entire world is this Force called Redemptive love and you know we go through our life and there's something in us that wants God whether we know it or not it doesn't matter there's something sitting in us that wants God now we may be brought up in church and understand okay there's a God yeah that's why this is here but then we may not be and we don't know what this thing is but it's in us and we just we want God no matter where we go no matter what we do no matter what situation we find ourselves in there's something in us that just always wants it we're just longing for something we're just longing for it it's just there you know and then there comes a point in time where that thing that we desired so much meets us like there's a response there's a there if there's a if there's a call Desire in here somewhere there's a response somewhere to meet that desire and when God comes and meets that desire what he does is he Woos Us by his [Music] love and he says you know what you had that thing in you all your life like you were wanting something he says you know why that actually is now this is something that happens this is not just a story this this happens he says it's because I have because you're mine you were mine when you were doing anything whatever you were doing all along you were mine and because he's got this Redemptive love that he knows we are his then he does something that he doesn't do for anyone else apart from you and he says I'm going to give you unconditional love in other words I'm all in I'm all in no matter what you do no matter anything I'm all in with my Redemptive love my unconditional love I'm all in no matter what you do you can never never disappoint me you you can never do anything that will cause me to love you less because that thing that's in you I'm going to respond to it cuz your mine and you try you try one time to try and stand against that Force called unconditional love you try it one day now if God had it for everybody then the whole world will be saved but he doesn't he has it for those that are his that unconditional love and you just get overtaken by it and then you worship that's why when you when you're in the tree in the morning you praise God but you're his and and this song in a sense is of response I just want to sing [Music] one I search the world it couldn't F me man's empty praise and treasure F I'll never know and you put me back together every desire is now satisfied hearing your love oh there's nothing there is nothing better than you there is nothing better than you Lord there's nothing nothing is better than you there is nothing oh there is nothing better than you there is nothing better than you Lord there's nothing nothing is better than [Music] you I'm Not Afraid show you my weakness my failures and force Lord you've seen them all and you still call me free is the god of the mountain is the god of the [Music] valley there's not a place your mercy and Grace won't find me again oh there is nothing better than you there is nothing better than you Lord there's nothing nothing is better than you oh no there's nothing there's nothing better than you there is nothing better than you there's nothing nothing is better than you oh there is nothing new there is nothing better than you there is nothing better than you there is nothing nothing is better than you

turn in the scripture shall we um today we're going to go to couple of familiar scriptures here amen it's good to be in church with you all today praise the Lord amen enjoyed the song service and amen praise the Lord so Isaiah 9 and6 says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father amen we're going to go just one more um scripture here um Matthew um 5 and9 so we talked about the um the pure in heart shall see God last Sunday and we're going to talk about blessed of the peacemakers for they should be called the children of God I trust that's your what you're known as this morning amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer shall we amen Let's uh let's go before his great throne of grace and prayer Lord Jesus how thankful we are that you washed us white as snow Lord truly Lord sin did leave a guilty stain but we're so thankful that's not the end of the story your blood is washed as white as snow thank you Father we can praise you and say thank you Lord we never did it in the first place Lord when you thought of Us Victorious dancing around your throne we're so thankful we're going back to that thought father we just want to pray dear God you'd have preeminence in the service take control may you anoint every one here myself speaker heer Lord Jesus those streaming dear God I pray you'd increase faith in our lives Lord God May Victory come like never before father I pray you would anoint your word to our hearts have your way dear God those who are sick in body touch them Lord father be glorified now MST father take that Gloom of the shadow of Lord doubt and unbelief away father in the name of Jesus Christ and may may all of our Lives be filled with your glorious Sunshine of Your Word of your presence granted father we love you we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you can have your seats this morning so I want to talk about blessed of the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God now a peacemaker is someone I'm just going to jump very quickly to the end and then we'll come back to the start but a peacemaker is one that the life of God shines out of because he's the real Peacemaker right we're not the so so when I'm talking about peacemakers here I'm going to talk more than just someone who brings uh you know humanly an agreement between two people who doesn't like to offend anyone we're going to go far beyond that because there's a real peace that must be made between God and man right and we're part of his Plan of Redemption now I was looking at the um the the definition of um Peacemaker and I was on Webster dictionary and and they said the word of the year is polarization that's the word of the Year 2024 is the year of polarization and we know because the world is falling apart the world will become increasingly more polarized it's not going to become unified uh it's going to be polarized sure you know the Beast will take over the Great Tribulation all those things but it's going to be a polarized world because the world has fallen apart now but we but we don't want to um focus on on that reality but the thing is there's got to be peacemakers in this polarized world there's a people that must be able to be like that person in the middle and it doesn't matter what color represents what there it really doesn't matter but someone who's in the middle of those two polarized groups calling everyone hey come come come come find real peace come from real Unity come under the Holy Ghost come under the word amen come come one with the Lord you'll find a real peace a real Harmony more than just a two people writing an agreement but it's really the blood of Jesus Christ can come and do a work and bring a real peace amen so we we read there that you the um they shall be called the children of God so there's something that man will see and we'll come into that soon but this word called uh it has many different um meanings but it means to Bear a name or a title among men so if you're a if you're a child of God you're bearing a title but you'll be known as a a peacemaker you won't be known as a Rabel Rouser or a Insurrection uh leader or you someone who leads a revolution uh apart from against the devil that's fine you know we can we can cause a lot of Revol we are actually revolutionaries in that regard but when it comes to between God and man we're not you know we're not here to stir up Strife we're here to bring the peace of God into every situation of Our Lives amen so this word Peacemaker got many different many syn whatever that is that s word there and it's similar there we go I haven't done English in a long time anyway it's a mediator it's a negotiator a counselor Ambassador it's many different things and it's attorney it's a middleman we are you know we are uh God wants to use us as as as a middleman between himself and Adam's Fallen race we're actually important in God's plan I trust this Christmas is different it becomes very personal this Christmas it comes a very a very real time because this world the devil's becoming very personal to this world I pray that the Holy Ghost become so personal in our lives that you know it's just such a reality there's such an atmosphere that flows out of our Lives of peace of God and you know when people come into your presence they don't get stirred up more they become calmer don't become more troubled they become more peaceful because because they've stepped into not your presence but the presence of almighty God I me because we're meant to be bearing God's Great Shalom the peace of God is in the bride right so this is this is the peacemakers they call the children of God I trust that's that's what you're known as we're just going to have a bit of a walk through the scripture today you know because we we need to go beyond the devil wants to hide try and Veil God behind tradition or religion or what's expected of us we're going to break through that Veil and break through that veil of just well this is what we do and say Lord I want you to be real in my life sure you may maybe years ago when I first met you you found me you're real but Lord I want you to be more real today I want to be sweet I want to be tender I want to be loving that people don't come to me for an argument maybe they come to vent but hey people do that but you know the venting doesn't go back it actually somehow gets extinguished and there's just this peace and a calm and you maybe it's not even what you say but just the atmosphere you carry causes people to feel they can relax blessed are the peacemakers they'll be called the children of God am amen now this is from the um this is now I need this version of the Bible it's called it's called the uh Bible and in in basic English version I need this I thought this was a bit more clear than the King James or the king James is clear but and and I read that but hey I always have different versions of the Bible in my Esau program right who who who who who does that our man's not here he'd probably say yes he does that but you know but but but sorry okay but now so this is this is the Lord speaking here in Ephesians says but now in Christ Jesus you who were one time were a far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ for he is our peace who has made uh the two into one and by whom the middle wall of Vision has been broken down having in his flesh put an end to that which uh made the division between us even the law with its rules and orders so that he might make it himself of two one new man so making peace so he's The Peacemaker right I put this in because he's The Peacemaker right you got to realize it's not your human ability that can bring peace man's tried to do that for thousands of years and and it's just take one crazy drunk man with too much vodka in a system to push a button and the whole world's going to go up right because they don't understand it's National Spirits fighting that's why where there's division it's actually demon Spirits vying for control right but we want to go beyond that and say Lord we don't want the national Spirit or some Spirit of a movement controlling us we want your Holy Ghost to come and bring peace and Reconciliation that's why the Millennium is going to be a time of Peace because God's going to rule amen but he's got to start somewhere it's got to be in you and I amen the millennium's got to start in here if I can put it that way we right that peace that reign of Peace should be in here first right it has to be so so he's The Peacemaker and that the two might uh come into agreement with God and one body through the cross are putting an end to that Division and he came preaching peace to you which were a far off and to those that were near now I just wanted to put that in there because he has he has broken down the division's over the div the gulf is gone it's been bridged right there's no more you know the devil wants to get us get it into our minds God's so far away somewhere if you think God's distant from you who's talking to you that's not him his word says I'm Nigh I'm closer than your Nick's breath you know I'm present I'll never leave you nor forsake you that's what his word declares so I'd rather take that than the devil tell well God's distant somewhere he's not in my situation God's in your situation God was in your situation in the world God was in your situation when you're in sin God was in your situation when you wanted to quit he says no I'm not letting you go you think you're alone in this but I'm with you many times want to say Lord I'm on your side but he wants you to know he's on your side amen he's here to back you up Hallelujah so the divisions come to an end amen so if there's anything that the devil you know he he loves us to to think no there is a golf but God's Bridge the gulf I like to talk God's language because God's language towards me is very good amen thoughts of Peace I'll come to an expected End Amen so now but you see there's always a battle you got to realize that we don't live by feelings remember this this this being a peacemaker it's not that you feel tranquil all the time and you got some nice kind of nice Vibe going on and everything feels good and you just got your favorite coffee in your hand there's no trouble and now you're at peace no you can you can be in the middle of the biggest storm political storm natural storm whatever storm that's going on your whole world could be in a million pieces going exploding everywh but you going have peace cuz you're cuz The Peacemaker is in you but you see we don't go by those things you got to realize the more you feel distant from God actually you're on the verge of a breakthrough it's very cont vice versa CU we want to feel look I'm ready I'm primed amen but it's actually in those moments that you feel cool and you feel indifferent and you feel like what's the use and why am I even here you're actually on the verge of a breakthrough like a plane going through a sound barrier you're just on that little crucks of a of a buff and you're through Amen brother Braham says this here he says now he says my flesh he's quoting Paul here my flesh always wants to yield to that your flesh does too see but the LW of the spirit of God in the heart overcomes the Flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do hallelujah look then if that will do that for a sinner then won't that work for sickness to the law of the spirit of God in the heart that knows that by his stripes we were healed they stand with their power and they and make that sickness in that body obey them because it's a devil there you are few that's got cream on it that deep I don't know how but he would have said pretty deep amen God bless you Carrie good to see you here amen trust you had a real good birthday amen God bless you praise the Lord good to see you my friend amen I tell you that's it see now the law of sin and death works in your flesh but the law of the spirit of Life Works in your heart so your heart your spirit and your heart will make your body obey what it says do that's exactly right that's what Paul said always the flesh says I'm too tired I'm unable I'm not sufficient I cannot do it who's had those thoughts I feel indifferent I don't I feel like what's the use I feel this and it's never a positive feeling right but you got to realize that that is actually and well I'll just finish the quote I said to Lois or Dolores or somebody's been talking to me about the Holy Ghost or something or another like that I said uh uh Dolores said what makes me feel that way just at the time that I should should have felt good I said the Devil he's seen you just ready to receive it he said I'll put a little damper on her few found her a little bit you know kind to cool down a little bit see oh my my that's when you rise claim your god-given rights amen that's that's what Paul's meaning see and always when he said when I do good evil is present amen so you got to come so it is a time to rise when you feel distant it's the time to rise am mean when you feel indifferent when you feel cool when you feel tired when you feel like just a thought you know God begins to bless you then a thought comes and blindsides you about someone or something or something got to face tomorrow that's a time to rise it's not a time to actually entertain those feelings you got to realize if you feel IND different you're on the verge of a breakthrough if you're feeling distant you're you're on the verge of a breakthrough you're right there on the crusp of the greatest event that could take place in your life amen and you say well that's very contrary well the reason you're on the verge of a breakthrough is because the devil's trying to stop you amen you say well I don't feel any kind of anointing well that's the time to rise amen cuz his word says he is here we don't go by feelings right we we go by his word his word says he is here that's good enough for me to believe amen if his word says He is present it's as if the same as he physically walked in here Amen in his Natural Body and I touched the Hem of His Garment amen it's it's exact because he and his word are one they're not two different people they're not two different classes his word is no lesser than himself because he is his word so if his word has declared I'll never leave thee nor forsake Thee I say Amen it's time to rise and take God at his word above how you feel I mean if his word says that he we're two or three are gathered in my name there I am in the midst so he's between me and you he's between you and the person next to you he's present am mean if we were just more conscious of the presence of God I think a lot of things would happen amen I think there'd be a lot more breakthrough if we realize the devil makes us feel indifferent because he's afraid we're about to get a breakthrough he actually sees you if we can go back to that he says uh here let's just let's just go back to this see the the Devil he's seen you just ready to receive it so he sees something that maybe you don't even see he's watching in that because he's in that unseen realm too he sees the light of God come into a building like brother RC I see dark streaks running and demons calling for help and all we can't necessarily see those things but we feel the presence of God and when God comes down what's that the place gets real light it's our faith Bank begins to build amen but the Devil Comes trying to put a dam on everyone it's not for you it's not your time well you you don't have a very good week so you don't qualify all these who has those kind of a thoughts I feel unworthy it's not about how you feel it's what God said about you that matters I mean God made me worthy cuz he died for me he didn't even ask me about it he didn't even ask me he didn't even ask my permission do you mind if I purchase your your salvation he just went and did it he didn't ask me permission do you mind if you write if I write your name in the Lamb's Book of Life he didn't ask me permission he just went did it hallelujah praise God so why do we have to ask the devil for permission Hallelujah well I don't feel worthy well that's actually irrelevant what has God done amen see that's the time to rise and claim your god-given rights God said so I take HT your word Lord irrespective of how I feel what I've been going through what I am going through no rise and claim your god-given rights amen but you see now see the devil is not a peacemaker that's pretty obvious right he's he he is the father of lies his Strife problems complexes things that are very murky and Troublesome and all those things that's him that's his job that's what he's that's what he does he is made to block access to God he cuz he's now perverted right so so he was the anointed cherub that cover so what did he do control access to God God right now he's perverted he takes that same position and he tries to stop you coming so if we feel cold different annoyed that's the devil trying to block you you got to say devil get out of my way maybe I just need to labor on this point a while we got to think about these things because we get in our mind we need to be a certain state of being and then I'm ready for a blessing no the two on the way to emus were brokenhearted downcast the world fell apart and brother R said the condition of those two were modern events make clear by prophecy they were a prophecy of modern events and they world had fallen apart everything had gone wrong in their eyes and they're walking to Aus and they are all upset and they misunderstood God fulfilling his word in their day but yet they still talking about Jesus and I think that's the best thing to do talk about him and he'll draw near to you am mean so they're talking about everything they didn't understand it all that's why they were the way they were if they understood what Jesus the Lord had just done they would have been dancing they would have been rejoicing because they would have realized he is the Lamb of God what John said he was he is amen and they would have been rejoicing because he just carried their sins far away Hallelujah and they should have expected the tomb to be empty because he said so so there they are brokenhearted down everything's Fallen apart yet Jesus went with them opened the word to them and then and then what did he do he broke the bread when they got into the house did what he did before the before he died did it again after he rose right to open their eyes to make them realize hey how you feel did not stop my me visiting you how you feel what you're thinking your mood your actions did not stop me walking with you and revealing myself to you Hallelujah why because they were part of the Resurrection also how was Legion did Legion deserve a blessing there he was in the tombs I'm just going to go because you got to think about it we think about I'm unworthy I'm not in a good State he was in a terrible state he was in a far worse State than all of us combined times 100,000 right but yet Jesus said I need to go across the sea how about the woman at the well she broke the word and she broke the word and she was living in sin but yet God said I need to go by the way of Samaria think about it so let's get it out of our heads I'm unworthy no the Lord has made me worthy it's his decision but you see so a peacemaker will always look at those kind of things because it's the devil trying to put trouble in your mind it's not for me I can't receive it I'm not worthy that's the devil putting that that's the devil's language cuz he's not worthy there's no blood for him anyway now where are we here there was a peacemaker in non's house blessed are the peacemakers they'll be called the children of God and she was a peacemaker because she did not let her past make her a person of strife there she was she was a she was a slave she was taken captive by Israel's enemy now she's working for uh non's wife and you know isn't it amazing where it says in verse three there and you know because she finds out that non's a leper and she says to her master's wife if only my Lord would go to the prophet in Samaria he'd be made well make him well but notice it wasn't non's wife that told nonon about it and then someone went and said to his Lord so obviously her words the atmosphere she carried it wasn't negative it wasn't bitter it wasn't resentful it wasn't vengeful cuz that's not a peacemaker no she had the peace of God something obviously when she was young something anchored in her heart Jehovah's God everywhere he'll he'll see you through doesn't matter what happens in life honey you you're going to be all right because God's with you do you realize I'm a daughter of Abraham even in a foreign land God was with her amen so she began to testify if only my Lord would have been been you know could go to the prophet in Samaria which is an enemy country by the way but you see obviously her words her the atmosphere she carried made her Words Be weighty Be impactful and I pray that our words are impactful to those who come around us even those who not even Christians especially those who aren't Christians but our words would carry weight they'd want to hear something from you because the atmosphere that because you're a peacemaker the atmosphere of God's flowing through amen that your words sure we can joke and justest and have fun whatever more more but when it comes to serious things that come under the influence of what you're saying like they did here she is a little Israelite girl not even doesn't have the Holy Ghost like we do doesn't have the blood of Jesus Christ like we do doesn't have all the Mysteries revealed like we do but yet she just had a she was a peacemaker but you see now so then of course you know the um someone says to his Lord which is non and you know what the girl from the land of Israel ISS and obviously you know the um king of Syria your name goes to the king of Syria king of Syria writes a letter gives him a lot of gold and silver and all these things and changes of clothes and then and then and then they go to the king of Israel now the king of Israel at this time um I just did a I just did a bit of a Google was uh jehoram which was the son of Ahab now he wasn't a this King was not a peacemaker cuz you see how he responded because he's a political you know someone who's political is not a peacemaker they're looking for Advantage they're looking to see how can this deal work in my favor what can I get out of this relationship what can I get out of this conversation what can I get see that's a political thing how does this reflect on me but a peacemaker doesn't care about how things reflect they just want the peace of God to flow they want to see everyone be benefited by the presence of God yep is that how you want your life to be I trust it is some of you looking at me like no I I trust it turns into a yes maybe you're thinking I I hope so are we here today hello everyone class I know school's finished for some but you know anyway this is not a lecture hall but you know what I mean we're focused right amen so you see now but you see he wasn't a peacemaker because his first reaction was he thought has this King come to pick a quarrel with me has he actually just done this whole thing to fight me you know this is see see a peacemaker just thinks peace right someone who's not a peacemaker just thinks fighting and fussing and arguing and all those things you know said you has he come to send a fight with me and you see his overreaction with the you know you know reads the letter and he just Rin his clothes and says am I a God to kill and make alive imagine this guy sitting in his throne room all of his court there and people he just reads this letter and throws a big hissy fit he's causing trouble to come into his cabinet cuz he's not a peacemaker re you rents his clothes makes a big scene why because he's not he's not a peacemaker he's thinking about his advantage what's going to happen here but Elisha just basically says to him you know because Elisha was a peacemaker because he tabernacled the Living God who's the source of all peace right and basically he asked him the question why do you overact like this send him to me and you know uh he'll know if there's a prophet in Israel or not remember leprosy had never been healed up to this moment but you see Elisha was a peacemaker just relax man basically don't don't get worked up about nothing there is a God in Israel actually the God I know prophesied of the Doom of your father why didn't you serve him amen the god the God that I serve brought fired out on Mount carel he this guy was this King was probably alive when that happened but you see and Elisha would have no doubt just just be reconciled to God don't don't don't overreact don't make a mountain out of a mole hill is it really that bad well you don't know what the you no just relax you see the thing is because Elisha was reflecting heaven jehoram was not and brother bam says in a prisoner I trust we all listen to the message of the week he says the physical has to die if but if you're reflecting by your mortal life the light of heaven then you're reflecting the eternal life God then when you die you can no more than go to that light amen if you're reflecting Heaven you have to go that's what he's saying if the life of God is in your life there's only one place you can go I trust that makes makes me happy just saying it amen so so if your if your life is reflecting God then to God you shall go but if your life is not reflecting God to God you shall not go well how do you reflect the light of God repent be baptized the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen he says but if you're of the Dark World you reflect that and you can do and go no other way but to Darkness SE so we are in a reflection and we see that just as sure as the Holy Ghost reflect reflects light and life so does death reflect Darkness but we're the children of the light see I think sometimes like brother bam said in the same message he says sometimes I believe one of the great things I find in this day is the lack of sincerity of what we believe it's not the fact we believe it but the lack of sincerity sincerity in it are we really sin because we're all believers here right we're all enti message Believers we believe the whole word of God Yep this this is why we've gathered but but do we sincerely believe what what we have is there a sincerity a reverence a thankfulness or we just do we just take it for granted I trust we don't I just you it's like Christmas is very much for granted it wasn't to the wise men or his brother Isaac said the Shepherds it wasn't just another day for them it was a it was a very glorious day they had a supernatural visitation I doubt very much they ever got away from those kind of moments amen because maybe the next night they were out in the field they would have talked about it and the next night and they would have become known as the those Shepherds who walk through Bethlehem and called a big caused a big tumult to to happen because they're telling hey messiah's on earth now but they were peacemakers they were there to announce that Messiah was on Earth that there' be peace between God and man Hallelujah so it wasn't just another day but I say sadly for many Christmas has just become another thing on the calendar let's not make it another thing on the calendar this year sure we'll give gifts and do all those things but let's not M it m it mean more to us now than it ever has in our entire lives I've received God's WAP gift of eternal life Hallelujah and I haven't just been caught up in the rapping I've got the package on the inside Hallelujah so I trust that we you know that we do not lack sincerity of what we believe that God is on the earth now we know physically he'll come but his spirit's here he's in you and I I trust he is I pray he is today he's living in us amen we've been restored back to the true word of God we're not living under Creeds and dogmas no more where God is bound God has become Unbound the message of the hour releases the Holy Ghost among the people I trust we sincerely believe that I mean we''re been restored back to the book of Acts again hallelujah amen we've arrived amen we're not getting back there we've got back there we're living in the fullness of the blessings of God hallelujah amen praise the Lord I sorry if I get happy I'm happy okay these things are good amen now you see James see see James would speak about because you blessed are the um uh in Matthew sorry blessed are the peacemakers they'll be called the children of God so being being the children of God is because your faith is seen uh in your life right so when James and Paul in the Book of Romans would speak about Abraham James is uh James justifies Abraham by his works right we know that okay but then when but then when Paul writes about the life of of of Abraham Abraham was justified by faith okay now we understand that this is not a contradiction they're not contradicting they're not arguing actually because it's like Faith see being justified by faith is because God sees your faith right but being justified by works is because man sees your life your works okay so so James is writing from the perspective of what man sees works right but then uh Paul in Romans is writing from what God sees Faith Revelation okay so the two actually blend together because remember blessed are the peacemakers they'll be called the children of God so people should see and I'm sure they actually do see that we are the children of God there's something different about them by the atmosphere they carry the things they speak about and do and so on he says my work shows my faith see now what you're speaking of your faith is what God sees in you and your works is what the other people see in you that's for difference between James and Paul here explaining about Abraham they never contradicted one another they was both the same married so is faith that doesn't produce Works anyone has a right to doubt your testimony now do you hear it before we start the prayer line if your faith doesn't produce works with it you can't make uh anyone believe that you're healed see well I don't know see yeah yeah sure I've got all the faith in the world you don't because if you had you got faith then the works is married to Faith your husband and wife one identifies the other so when people see you're a Believer you don't need to tell them you're a Christian cuz your life declares who you are amen are we are we together he says also in the prisoner he says now don't judge your life by how much power how much uh you have to perform Miracles and we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge we have of the word but always judge yourself look back and take inventory of what kind of a fruit the life you presently live now is bearing so is it bearing Joy love peace long you you're the fruits of the spirit as your life bearing that right or is it bearing strife and envy and Malice and bitterness and resentment all these things what is our what are our lives producing I I believe it's producing the fruits of the spirit amen see we are the light of the world I'm just going through these things see we Jesus said it's like a candle cannot be hidden under a bushel or a city can't be hid you know you you know it's placed on a hill that it cannot be hid so let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so people would see glorify God these people are your children God they are peacemakers God they are you know they're different to everyone else they''re been built Lord you've changed them that now they're peacemakers they were once in strife and under their family spirits and doing what their family did but Lord You've transformed them Lord they they're a different kind of a people they're like you amen praise the Lord because we've got a glorious message to share in this day amen now um in the in the Book of Leviticus there's the there's the law of the uh um when there's a sacrifice when a plague when there's a plague of leprosy that it be healed in the leper there's a there's a sacrifice to be given he says then shall the priest command to take for him uh so so that he be cleansed two birds alive and clean Seward scarlet and hsip and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earth and vessel over running water and as for the living bird he shall take it and the seedar wood and the scarlet and the hisp and shall dip them and the living bird and the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water and he shall sprinkle upon him that uh that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times and shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose into the open field now we know leprosy is a type of sin right and peacemakers God uses peacemakers to remove leprosy out of people's lives sin right this this is what real peacemakers do amen God lives through them that the peace of God will come into their lives they'll surrender their lives to God and that what they are cleansed from that leprosy of sin amen so we so so this uh sacrifice here is there's there's there's two birds right two doves and they're the same type of animal same type of bird one is killed and the the blood of the Dead one is put on the living one right and then that living one fly is is is released into an open field and then what happens is the blood of the Dead mate now bathes the Earth as it flies right because we're carrying we're carrying the blood of Jesus Christ right he was the dead bird he was the dead mate he was killed that down Calvary right but then his life was released and it came on to the Apostles of the 120 in the upper room right and then what happened the dove begin to fly amen now now that same experience happens to you and I amen we're not carrying see see the dead the dead mate it wasn't it wasn't um carrying its uh its own life it wasn't bathing the the Earth in its own life right or its own Humanity its own ideas it was bathing the Earth in the blood of its dead mate right so when when people come into our presence I trust they come into the presence of almighty God they don't get caught up in our Humanity they don't get caught up in us and try and try and replicate us but they get caught up in the presence of the one amen that's coming out of us hallelujah am mean you see uh Noah would Noah would release a dove out of the Ark and there came a point where the Dove came back with an olive leaf and then a few days after that he um you know uh released it again and it didn't return but when the Dove came back with the olive leaf it was symbolized izing to know that the waters were abated from off the Earth so the wrath of God was going away the Judgment was going away amen and that and that Dove now we know a dove represents peace right it's a symbol of peace a dove a dove with a olive branch in its mouth is a symbol of peace around the world not just in Christian circles but around the world and we know uh you a um a olive tree it represents Victory according to google amen it also represents you know oil we know olive oil represents the anointing or the anointed ones amen so this Dovewood this Dovewood uh was returning to Noah as a sign that he was about to step into a new world the time of waiting in the ark was over amen the water was AB the the Judgment of God was going down and and Noah was about to step into a new world it was a very different world to the one he stepped out of when he stepped into the ark it was all different right so it was a symbol of uh uh that he would know he was about to go into a new world and so now we are if if Christ was the Dead one and we are the living one right us us in this age is a symbol to this world that we're about to step into a millennium amen we are we are a symbol to this world the Millennium is going to come soon amen praise the lord well that's how I see it anyway why because God is God his bride ready remember the tribulation can't fall into till the bride's all learning up right nothing sure there's a lot of saber rattling a lot of trouble on the Earth but nothing can happen until the bride is gone and its fullness right that they can have their threats they can say we're going to Nuke the world Putin can say what he wants to say and whatever whatever but nothing can happen until that bride is gone so we're actually a symbol to this world there's a new world coming and also we're a living symbol saying you can come to amen why because we're the peacemakers the peacemakers in US amen praise the Lord hallelujah what are we doing Flying upon this Earth bathing it with the blood of Jesus Christ the life not our own life but the life of our dead mate even even as Malachi would say but but un you that fear uh my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall amen well where is the healing in his wings where is that healing it is is he in US you can pray for people are not even Christians and God can answer your prayers what healing can come to people I mean that's why prayer requests come in do they not pray for me I'm going through this or this is happening what and then healing can come through the body God can work through the body to each is this okay some people get a bit funny when you talk about God working through his body God's always work through his body not saying this here but that camera goes to a lot of places people clip out things and whatever more anyway they can do that for that one but you see we to realize that you know God works through his body amen so where's that healing going to arise it's from the Holy Ghost in his people am amen the Lord would say that his Heritage is as unto me a speckled bird brother BR would say that that speckled bird is that dove that's been dipped in the blood of its dead mate but that's his Heritage that's his that's the place he lives that's his heirloom amen see we're not just here um see if we are peacemakers which we are The Peacemaker is in us I know I'm repeating myself a bit but I'm just coming to the end of this just now we're going to we're going to we're going to pull over amen you see trying to find where I am here God wants to make us as doves we're all born with a actually a a dove nature on the inside but it's asleep it's dormant and we all have this Crow nature here am me that that we're born with he says now he says that a dove a dove don't even have to take a bath there's doves that there's doves that have a they they they secrete an oil that just keeps them clean the whole time amen there's actually something from the inside that cleanses their lives they don't have to take a bath oh Hallelujah a Dove's body because uh he is a dove he got oil that comes through his feathers that just keeps him clean all the time because it comes from the inside out amen so this peace that that comes out of the Bride of Jesus Christ is not a manufactured piece there's a life like a dove that can get dirty but there's a secretion of oil that pushes that dirt off their bodies pushes it off their feathers am mean why because it comes from the inside out it's the same thing with us friends the Holy Ghost pushes out am mean sure there's a lot of dust and dirt and things to the world that we find ourselves honestly you know we step into accidentally but that oil on the inside cleans us of it hallelujah amen and you know that you know and like brother BR would say that you know we're a special a dove is a special built bird he says a crow and a dove cannot talk together a crow can eat of the old dead carcass a dove and one uh uh is one bird without gall if it would eat the dead carcass it would kill it it's a special built bird a dos and a dove only eats grain he has no Gall he could not digest it so as a Christian has no all of bitterness in them see there was once a time we could eat the dead things of the world we could snack on them and get fat on those things but when God comes in and changes our nature to be that of a dove those same things make us sick right makes us feel troubled makes us feel very uneasy before it didn't make us feel uneasy we enjoyed it right but then when God changes our nature because we become a peacemaker right there's something in us we can't eat off those things anymore Hallelujah why because we become a special built bird there's nothing in that can digest it amen makes us feel we just can't see see see there's some people that live and only seem to thrive in drama we all know some people like that I say that's not a peacemaker we should be very peaceful people we don't like I don't do drama that's me personally you know maybe I'm boring I don't know but I like I like things that just calm collected not drama nothing like that you know I I I think peacemakers don't like drama they don't like trouble you know some people like especially who thrive in drama they feel uh you know they seem like they're half asleep until drama comes into their life it's like something's just like pumped into them they come alive and awaken they start going why because drama's you know but you know it's like a drug to them some people they love you know they love Gossip they love to chew it over and spread it around and they seem actually half asleep until until gossip comes in one ear they be spread you know they come alive oh did you hear this did you hear that before that they just kind of you know are you he the you are you here are you alive but when they hear why because but that's the thing is they've still got a g that that they enjoy those things I don't like hearing gossip I don't Thrive gospel is not something I like to hear amen but you see it's but you see it's a that's not a peacemaker because gossip is like a was it a sulfuric acid it's very it's terrible stuff Burns everything comes in touch with amen but you know they you know people who have still chewing on those things and enjoy them they seem to only come alive when they you know get animated when they talk about the world or you know some people only really get animated when they talk about what they used to be in the world it's like their thing they love talking about they love to be and sadly it's because they're still proud about what they were I'm not proud of what I was I'm very thankful I'm not that guy anymore I'm very very thankful I never want to go back to being him right but some people thrive about you know they really come alive when they talk about what they were I think sadly that Dove nature hasn't come in yet nothing wrong with sharing testimony right but you know what I mean he some people just really Thrive talking about what they were well they still got that gal they're still you know enjoying those things you know their are their identity is still in that F memories of what they were but so so they're not peacemakers yet see it's all the dead carcass that the Christian can't feed on and enjoy some people thrive when there's a cause to fight against right they need some it's like a pball or something they they have to fight something who's ever come across those kind of Bill they're not peacemakers they need some kind of dragon to slay they need some kind of someone to shoot or I don't know they just need to they only come but that's not a peacemaker that's a warmonger that's a mercenary someone who needs to you know you say well you know and and it's like you know their fire goes out when they don't have an enemy some kind of controversial thing to fan or feed or whatever more but you see but then you may ask the question well think about it you know but don't we have a real enemy to fight does not our cause against the devil identify us it doesn't actually our identity is in the word of God he just gets in the way right I'm not identified by my fight against the de Vil that's not my defining thing my defining thing is I'm a Child of God I'm a Son of God I've been birthed by his word I've be made in His image he identifies me the devil just gets in my way actually the devil's actually a tool in God's hand to bring me closer to God Amen I think you know if some people some people get very intense about what the devil could do to them and they get fixed say the devil can do this and he may do this and he's on my case here if they just took that same intensity and put on to the word of God and how great God is and how powerful he is and how able he is and how Almighty he is he's The Undefeated Undisputed champion of the world if they put that intensity that fixation upon God Revival would break out amen incredible things would happen so I think let's not be fixated the devil does not make me who I am God makes me who I am amen he makes me who I am not the devil his word says who I am so my my identity is not caught up in whatever the devil will do no it's who what God has made me to be Hallelujah see it comes there's no busness there's no none of those things see it comes from the inside out not from the outside in it's a birth he says bless God I go to church the same as you Hallelujah my church is as good as yours hallelujah we're just oh you Buzzard that's right but a dove is oiled from the inside there's certain gland in the Dove that's not and and one other bird like it like a dove or a pige pigeon he oils himself pardon me he keeps himself clean all the time he don't have to keep himself clean there's something on the inside of him that keeps him clean Oh Sister way Hallelujah something inside of him keeps him clean amen I trust that's the same with you and our friends this morning there's the Holy Ghost is just oozing out that keeps us clean busness tries to come along it may land but it doesn't Stick It Gets pushed out am mean disappointments come but it can't stick it gets pushed out gossip comes along it may try and come in but doesn't stick it gets pushed out amen Strife comes along I'm just repeating myself but I want you to really you know whatever the devil tries to put on you it can't stay because there's a force on the inside that's far greater than your Humanity your arguments your logic your thinking whatever is going on that pushes those things out hallelujah hallelujah why because we've received the nature of the dove of God Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah that we can be called the children of God Amen I'm just going to finish there but I want to ask you the question this morning are you a peacemaker or are you a Strife stirer what a you know your life if you could look at you you know through someone else's eyes what would they see a sweet humble loving Christian that just loves the Lord in spite of what happens in life troubles whatever more but there's just a sweetness and and they can say I don't agree with what they believe but they are real genuine nice people do you want to be known as that CU they shall be called the children of God Amen and I believe I believe I'm looking at a room of the children of God today amen but I say Lord may this Christmas season may people see the children of God like never before amen no meanness no Strife no bad words against people Nothing kind of shooting you know shots and snide remarks and all those things and no may it just be sweet the love of God coming out amen and then people can come under the influence of the Holy Ghost that's coming out of not your influence his influence and they can be reconciled to God like you have been amen let's have the musicians please this morning um amen amen blessed are the peacemakers they shall be called the children of God Amen praise the Lord amen let's stand this morning praise the Lord amen let's um let's sing that song My Hope Is in the Lord Lord from this time on and even more amen praise the
