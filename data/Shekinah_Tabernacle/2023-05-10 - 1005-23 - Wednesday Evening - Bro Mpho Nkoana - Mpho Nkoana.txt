and and that each one will come with an expecting heart and that the Lord will just speak to you good to see you James are you all right good to see you son and then each one of you and so while we're standing let's just read in first John chapter chapter one then we can be able to sit first John chapter one I I don't know what title you know I guess as long as the message will come out uh brother met after I gave you the piece of paper I changed again but I'll tell you just now um let's read first John Epistle of John chapter one and go to verse 6. amen once you are there just say Amen we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son clean said us from all sin I'd like you to underline that word cleansing amen just bold it if you can let's continue if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and their truth is not in US verse 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar this is strong if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US gracious Lord Jesus we don't want to make you a liar tonight we lift up our hands knowing that we are sinners saved by grace and we thank you for the blood that was shared father that cleans us from that cleans us from all wit that cleans us from all habits from all strongholds from all generational cases from all type of of iniquity your blood cleans father and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for this pure blood that cleans more than the word pure itself and we appreciate you tonight we commit the service into your hands I say father please take over take over the speaker take over the listeners the hearts may you may the Holy Spirit just come and consume father and just encapsulate this service and every thought and every let us not law it around and linger out there but let us be inside you Lord Lord let us let us just be with you tonight and have this time special time with you you commit the service into your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you may enjoy the comfort of your sis brothers and sisters while I remain standing and we welcome each one and tonight I would like us to speak about Prada Med if you can capture it I said here I will I will tell you now get so disorganized and when all the time all the time you thought that you were organized my house is your dwelling Lord my house is your dwelling Lord and the the thought I want us to Take Along cleanliness cleanliness you know there's so many things happened around the house right and um but today I just want us to pick on just to follow the thought of cleaning cleanliness Ah that's the thought I would like us to think and to take along as we go along but as we go along I would like each one each one of us you know I have never had brother Heinz that a family they just leave their house dirty and they just go and clean at another man's house another family's house I've never heard about that I've seen people helping each other to clean houses but I've never seen a family just leaving a house deity if it happens correct me and then they just go and clean someone else's house so it means cleaning a house is important your house then you come and help me to clean mine is that right if you are coming first to me then we go to your house it's okay that is acceptable but the key message here is my house is your darling father can I keep it clean it's your house we understand when we read the word of God that and so many things happens around the house we built it from scratch new new house my sister welcome my sister did you mention your name and we built a new house even a new house after being built before we go in within it can we believe it brother Isaac we built a new house new out of the box as we say brand new if I was in Africa I was going to say brand new a brand new house that looks great and great before you move it before you move in you clean it how come what kind it means this thing called cleaning is very important and we also realized that you know after building and after doing all all you know decorating and after after doing all sorts of things and putting everything and allocating the rooms and and on a good foundation the house is certified and we are now living in the house we realize that this house from time to time it gets dirty even if it's a new house a modern house it accumulates debt as long as human beings lives in there it's even worse if no one lives there did you know that a house is even worse when nobody lives there it actually dilapidates even quickly have you noticed that even the grass they know that you are not there you'll just find the grass in the kitchen growing because there's no movement huh insects they quickly realize that there's no human here and they they start to take habitation in the house but as long as human beings are there even though they would love to come even though the grass would love to come but they cannot they cannot grow but the dust still comes through where does this dust come through when my house is insulated when my house is double what do we call those double those windows double glazed in Africa we don't have the double glazed double glazed clean in and out but we find that just hardly five after one week we have to clean a game we have to buy vacuum cleaners yeah in year out why because the aspect of cleaning goes together with where people dwells to Bath why don't we just bath once a week so tell you why don't we just part once a week and and leave it but I see that and I noticed that I bath every day some people bath twice a day because the aspect of cleaning being clean is important are we together so now if we are cleaning these bodies ah assistant we are cleaning them three times I don't mean you and now we buy what they call what do they call this thing of spraying deodorant hey that word is a subject of discussion in my house a deodorant you buy a deodorant a big one preach not just so spray three times a day and then we clean the house we vacuum it you know Sister Sister Priscilla loves a clean window clean things for for these physical things we are doing that and we don't really pay much more time attention and the focus and zealousness on our spiritual house isn't it true brotherheim that the Lord said this is his house we're living in a three-roomed house isn't it we you your soul yourself you you not this you're living in a three-roomed house it's you it's your soul your spirit and this outside man who is actually just depend on your soul really he depends on you if you leave he just lay down there is there three aspects of ourselves so we are focusing more on this outside man even our physical houses we've built a mansion I was telling some people that you know there in Somerset West in Cape Town there was a house even the way we care so much about our health and what we breathe and the sunlight not facing house there was a house there that could tend with the sun you know it belonged to Mike Schumacher if I'm not mistaken you know you know the raising guy it belonged to him he that house the first floor was telling you with the sun if the sun goes to the West it goes you have sunlight sunlight and because they don't want house mice we want sunlight one fresh air we want we want one to be ten one to ten our to our inside house do we clean it regularly remember the physical types there spiritual when the children of Israel left Egypt and they were traveling can you see yourself that's symbolic Journey which was real for them is as real to us today can you see yourself can you see yourself leaving Egypt can you picture yourself crossing the Red Sea and crossing the Red Sea it in the manner drinking from the Waters of Mara that was bitter now he's sweet can you can you see yourself standing on the border of goddess Vania before they cross the river if you can see yourself in that Journey that means everything that happened to them should happen to me and to you the only things that this time is more spiritual application let's look at it let's read Joshua 24. and I'm not going to be long hopefully let's read Joshua 24 from verse 14 to system to to verse 15 sister Talia okay otherwise I can read it okay sure thank you so much brothers for that men that is Golf Course now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth this is Joshua talking to the people telling them about exactly what I'm telling you about the issue of the house listen to him and in truth now he says serve him in sincerity underline that and in truth put away the gods the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flat let's pause there we said you see yourself going out of Egypt can you cross the Red Sea now on the other side of the river they were saving the Gods them me and you were saving the gods of the amorites we're saving the gods of the jebusides the side of the river are we together now and in Egypt and they served he the Lord on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord he's telling them leave those gods and serve ye the Lord next verse and if it if it seems evil unto you to save the Lord I don't know how possibly can this be if it seems evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will save decide whether because you see before you go the let's pause you need to come to a point of decision because if you don't it's going to be actually challenging and difficult for you to to continue cleaning your house it's going to be difficult it's going to be challenging just to take a broom and sweep because we have not made up your mind you haven't decided that today I've chosen to serve God it's going to be difficult because you have not decided you will still clean but we are going to force you we are going to beg you you are going to be reminded to pray because you have not really decided you do say that you have decided but you are reminded you set a reminder remind me to pray you know if I tell you I've always I always give this example brother that if we say tomorrow there is a chartered airplane only first class you know those airplanes where we sit looking at each other with tables in the middle you know those ones top top and tomorrow you're going to the coronation let's say next week or tomorrow next week to the coronation of King Charles they call him King Charles of what the 10th or his word King Charles of what what number is he I don't know you here's a ticket you don't have to do anything a limousine will stop in Shannon by your before your house it's gonna you're gonna climb the limousine off to not even Willington Airport to the military airport I don't know if there's a military airport here then you are going to be chattered to go to the coronation of the King Charles the head of the United Kingdom it's addressed to you David Lee what is next week Saturday the coronation will be on Monday and there there's already a 10 star hotel booked for you oh you want 11 bro Livingston ready for you now what is going to happen in your mind you've got the tickets what will be happening leading to to that event are you I'm telling you now you can bet you can take me on on this one even the day you're going to leave the reminder of the watch is not going to be necessary you're going to wake up on the dot three hours before you leave James I said before and I don't want to repeat I don't know what kind of suit you're going to buy because that's very important that's the once in a lifetime Oppo opportunity that you can never afford to lose now here is an opportunity to spend eternity with God the only thing that is seemed to be disturbing is that you are sitting in flesh but everything is being done everything has been sorted and paid and done for you now the only thing is that for you just for a little bit longer persevere to be feathered just until you go how does that sound does that sound exciting so you don't need to be reminded to clean the house let's let's hear what Joshua told them because he can see they are pulling their legs man you know when someone is pulling their legs you you struggle to get them excited about the things of God but the moment you say hey let's go racing the same guy he's jump he jumps this high let's go play volleyball and beat the children brother Ed oh come my brother sorry brother but hey let me bring something spiritual oh yeah yeah then the will Goes Pop why are you are we excited enough now listen to Joshua it's not like Joshua does not love them Joshua was there with these people from day one from the day they left Egypt until now he's now giving them what we call an ultimatum an iot Mater he says there and he says choose you this day whom you will save whether you the gods which your father said is reminding them that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and in whose land you dwell because you are dwelling in the land of the amorites right now because you found them there huh remember you you defeated them you took this land it's your land now but it's actually there it was there land before you now he says in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will save the Lord what does saving the Lord entails the previous verse he spoke about sincerity can you just go back a little bit one more respect sincerity and in truth is it the first time you hear this word even in the New Testament that if you Worship the Lord in spirit and in truth are we together so that means those are the elements the aspects of ensuring that your house is clean every single day now you sweep you clean you sweep you clean your vacuum every day in this in this house that's what I'm supposed to do and it's a challenge but it's actually if I I twist the coin it's not much of a challenge because he said while you are in that house I shall be with you and I will be with you would you like the king I can tend that drama again and say let's say you don't go to the king the king comes to you to your house I don't know how that house is going to look like I'm telling you you will even rfbf taranagi Tauranga all our sister churches we will call them to come help us to clean this house because the king is coming the king of England coming to the anguana house ah I bet this is history it's a serious matter and I'm telling you because it will come on newspapers even the king chose this young man and his young wife and their family then you'll just hear a deacon call me brother just tell the newspaper to write also who Fellowship said Shekinah Tabernacle because it's an important event are we together I'm not trying to make a joke all I'm trying to say is that the magnitude of that event now the King has come once to dwell on a daily basis in this house a king shouldn't we the least we can do because you can clean yourself literally technically me can keep myself clean I'm a sinner I'm not able I don't I don't know I'm not I don't have the capacity I can't overcome Satan by myself but the king says I will be with you and I will be in you inside you to help to clean that house disinfected all the time where is the Cockroach free house resembles a demo when I see it [Laughter] a fly is even worse I had to buy a gun for the Flies because when I think the brothers saw a vision one time and there was there was a moth there was a moth I don't like moths maybe because of that there was a month and that month he was seeing a vision and it was just going around so wobbling so fat and it still flies demonic spirits there are certain animals that that shows demonic spirits certain animals are more associated with demonic spirits we'll talk about that one day and others are more associated with the Holy Spirit you know like a dove can you just hear the word Duff a white one not an eagle those are animals that are associated lion lamp but the moment you tell me of a bed or their tortoise he saw such kind of things and now I lost my check so the king is coming to clean I mean to stay at your house you are going to do a magnificent job but the king is even here with you say hey I will be inside you you are going to I'm telling you brother and sister you're going to make sure that you ask the lord lord Solomon said give me wisdom give me the spirit of discernment to be sensitive enough to your spirit it's about being sensitive enough to the spirit of God that your spirit should be able to pick up anything we allow so much through our filter to come through it's not like we just say we want to be dirty but we are we asking God enough to say Lord Lord let my vacuum cleaner be better than the sun that's some someone you know that he knew some someone it takes even the smaller let my let my filter not allow that that's what we should be asking Mama Christine to say Lord I want to be so sensitive in my in myself I can't do it but but help me to be so sensitive to your spirit that I don't offend the spirit on a daily basis if you do that I'm telling you you're going to find that the cleaning of your house is going to be so enjoyable you're living in a non-reminded environment no one reminds you the spirit himself reminds you let's move on a bit and read Matthew 12 25. I'll read it for you quickly and Jesus knew their thoughts this is now when he found them at the at the House of Prayer in the House of Prayer he found them selling marketing advertising doing sin in the house of God and Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them oh sorry no that's not the one sorry this is a different one you know ministers we sometimes we mix up scriptures but I'll tell you that thought but this one is saying the house divided against itself you you cannot be you cannot serve God and save more money at the same time and allow them to dwell in the same house as clean people cannot afford to live with rats in the house the same house we are living a master plan because they eat everything those guys these guys they damage everything ask kiratula to tell you what we did whenever we were living in a lifestyle block when we find them we were treating them but hey man it's like those things they come we were really really dealing with them rats because they destroy everywhere they pass so now we God cannot afford to live with evil spirit in this house which dog are we feeding more daily which one okay you can only know that he asked God to give you a sensitive spirit because look brothers and sisters we are here on Earth we are somehow connected to this earth although we are not of this Earth but we work here God found it in him to bring us here so that we can bring glory and honor to him and demonstrate and manifest his will so we are here we can't help we can't run away from there but while we are here we need a specific wisdom we need a specific anointing from him to help us how to live imagine I come here and I don't find no brothers I don't find no sisters I find no one no you know no one who welcomes me I'll be a lost man at least for the first two years trying to make friends and even so you need someone who knows the territory someone who understands the terrain of this place to tell you what to do how to do who to talk to where how am I right so he said he's gonna be with us now you need him to make sure that you you are so sensitive to the spirit they say a prophet I don't know why I read this the way he's built physically you know he's diaphragm you know I die from this there's a certain part of just above or below the lungs when you breathe it goes it regulates how you breathe so a prophet is diaphragm is is building a certain way almost I don't know when he breathe or what I don't know about he's able to be able to enter into the Unseen World easily by vision he's built differently that's how I prove it so with me and you need to be to have that part of God that's that makes us to be sensitive to the spirit you know there's a party there's a verse in the Bible that says you know your brother just lied to you after lying to you he says oh no wasn't I joking you know that verse I I've just paraphrased it wasn't I joking so it means that even to the very day-to-day talk the way we think the way we think about our brother our sister this is very serious I don't control my thoughts yes you do the thoughts the pastor taught us that the thoughts are like flying dates you can allow them to build a nest or not huh so that's like the thoughts you can Devils can never be able to build where the spirit of God Reigns they want the demons will it's like there's fire around you there's a certain presence around you that the certain Junior demons don't come closer to you you know there's Junior and senior demons certain Junior demons you know they know I can't go to this man because there's always a certain presence this house is so clean it's so clean that even a fly you know flies don't like clean places you don't know this a fly don't like a clean place is for Real they like a place where it's dirty if they can come into a clean Place they've identified something that they need to contaminate they want to contaminate it they don't like cleanliness that's like demons when they come when it's clean it's because they want to contaminate they prosper and and and and and and and and multiply where it's dirty I'm not saying we are deity brothers and sisters if this is the hard talk please understand me that the thought that I'm trying to bring across is that a continually clean Christian huh the presence of the Lord remains in that person's life and that's the whole idea why we have to continually make sure that we are clean that we are sensitive through the spirit otherwise this house will not be able to serve the purpose which it is made to do to save are we together listen to this I will read for you now the man of God here in the message called a blessing prophet preached in 1956 November 25th in the evening he says that's right coming to ask God for something and looking like a jezebel this is harder this is the hard saying I agree it's a hard one but it has to be hard because only the truth will set you free if I come here and just say oh no no the prophet sorry about what the man of God said no no no no that's what he said it has to be solved Lord give me a lubrication to swallow what you are saying so that it can build me and help me looking like adjustable coming to ask God something what we need today is a house cleaning I'm not I didn't make a presentation but I can give you this paper after after church is the house cleaning and a heart warming of prophets of God who will stand in the Pulpit yeah and I call the thing out and and tell that's right and what's wrong in the priest of gospel without compromising until Sinners fall on the floor and a weep till God sends the Holy Spirit to clean up their life isn't that awesome it's so great when a sinner because we are all sinners we have we have agreed at the beginning right we are only saved by grace isn't it great when we see one who who whom we used to look like come to God I think it's an exciting thing I think it's a wonderful thing if we can accept that point that is so awesome to see somebody saying brothers and sisters pray for me here sister Maggie come come pray for me myself I'll come to your house there is this issue that has been bothering me for so long so the Lord has delivered me because the Bible says confess your sins once to the to the other right come play with me my sister hey what is it and I tell you I tell oh thank you then we pray isn't it a lovely thing I think even Heaven gets happy so we mustn't discourage that it must be preached that hey if you can't stand before the people go to your brother go to your sister say hey pray for me on this issue man there's an issue that even jig does not remove it do you know jig bleach I applied all sorts of what's that new ones Allah showed us this this new one that is so strong all the stains they go well you've applied all you can you prayed all you know how this thing doesn't seem to go now it's time for you to expose it talk to your brother join in prayer call another one join in prayer I've never seen a demon that was that really really really God failed to remove I've never I've never heard of a demon that did not go if the spirit of God come they all run away they can come back and check later yes but there are and they run hard when you come hot amen I'm not hearing such strong amens tonight is it because I'm I'm I'm hard on you please forgive me I love you very much and I don't mean to be hard all I'm trying to say is that these what you're hearing is applicable to me it means a lot to me it challenges me it provokes me it Pricks me it means me I must change that's how I'm taking it and I'm praying that you take it the same way because I'm taking it the same way I say Lord thank you for showing me this in fact I don't even have to preach let me go and implement it in my life but he said no no go share it with others don't be selfish that's what I'm doing here let's read the next message here this one comes from life the message titled life Christian 57 in June the second June the second may that be the motives of this church this morning this evening may your affections be turned from the things of the world the cares of the world whether it's your house being clean whether it's your farm being weed with it sorry we did is it the right one we did we did President speaks a good English we did w-e-e-d-e-d we did with it we did it's not brother tend to go oh Lord thy love thy love kindness is better to me than all life meaning that nothing on this Earth matters Lord even life here doesn't matter your love your loving kindness it means more than life to me amen that's why it's important for us to hear these things my soul says after thee like I was in a dry land and like the heart for the water broke my soul must find the one day I preached a sermon here and I said there is a problem when you don't fast for God there's a problem and that's it there's a problem it does not mean that you are the problem no no it means there's a problem and it needs to be addressed what does test for God mean thirsting for God it means you are yearning you want more of God not talking more of having God wanting really getting desperate you know I had a desperate person A desperate person will beg you will tell you things that hey David if you can't help me man I'm finished please my man David I'll do this for you you know me for a long time it will beg you because he's desperate A desperate request is full of tears I don't care whether there's not who is listening to me I need this and this means life to me desperation will make you to get things from because you mean business so A desperate God A desperate person will make God to move to him because God can see this one is not turning back um I wanted to read this one and finish I didn't finish that part and my soul test after the like our senior dry land and like the heart for the water broke my soul must find thee or perish Tabernacle gets to that place the little isms will drop off out of the door the differences will be all settled out Christians will be Christians a Christian must be a Christian I don't know if that sings deeply a Christian meaning a Christian must not be mixed you know a mixed Christian depends where we are depends on the mood and the weather and the circumstances in the situation you know a Christian is not it's not like that a Christian is a Christian it will be a sport that will be talked of around the world when any Congregation of people will thirst for God in that manner they thy love kindness is better to me oh Lord than life I want to conclude I want to read for you again from another message called the message of the audition Church this was preached in 580609 certainly we have certainly we have that's true not to hurt you because sometimes we speak things that are hating the word of God is Not Meant to it's not only meant to comfort sometimes it meant to comfort you but hating you I don't know if I can put it correctly okay the Lord realized that this ship is is running too much around he took it and then he broke his leg Now isn't it isn't that hating but actually that is love it makes sense how can you take a sheep and break his leg is hurting but if you look at look at it with spiritual eyes look at it from from Heaven's perspective not from Earth's perspective to hit my boy is Lavo brother Ed and hitting them with a smile and daddy listens to this oh did you hear that and you say that is love now you're hitting me but actually if you go to the root of it a two dead will be it will be paining him it will be out of love right it was out of love that that Shepherd really broke that foot because after breaking it he then put what do you call a moon boot here today put a moon boot on it and I applied the balance of gilia on it after breaking himself in other words he says my boy my daughter don't don't hear I want to hear by me there's jail calls there there's hyenas there's wolves are you hearing Mrs so that's what he said and then now the prophet of God says here that's true not to hurt you but to tell you the truth we've got to clean up I'm not going to identify your uncleanliness and tell you this this no no each one of us if really we want the Rapture to come to go with the bridegroom if we really wants to if we are realizing what is happening around us we are realizing what is happening around New Zealand we are realizing the financial markets we are realizing the wars and the rumors of wars we are realizing all the earthquakes and we're realizing all the all the natural disasters we are realizing that the time that the Lord has spoke about is here and is here and now if we are realizing that if we are realizing that the love of many is growing works is diminishing if we are realizing that the age we are living in is more about me I and myself all those things and many many more the the cup of iniquity is getting full is full for the brim that is why even when they drink coffee they want it full you know dreaming out out full because we are living in that age where the cup of iniquity full everything is vomit everywhere is vomit you can you can't walk wherever you look whatever you do so how are you going to work as a brother and there's a vomit everywhere nakedness everywhere you're a sister a Son of God and you are right working right next to the vomit you need a special special inspiration and that can only come if you are really sensitive to the spirit you are really under the inspiration of God on a daily basis otherwise your you have to find yourself one day swearing yourself oh I didn't mean that sorry swearing the Bible says those things should not be heard even from us not not even them those things they should they like the likelihood the appearance of anything like that must not even be heard next to us this is just a reminder brothers and sisters go sorry go to have a Revival and tell and get all the the backs out of the bugs out of the thing before this is the prophet he says we've got to get out all the bugs out God will ever come in if we remove all those things now now it's not meant to demoralize you it's meant to let you pause and say Lord check me check me Lord because this is life and death certain decisions I take they're questionable certain certain movements that I make are questionable Lord remove my pride you know this if there's one thing that God hates if there's one thing that God hates it's a proud heart and that Spirit of a proud heart is here today in laodicea we are very proud people full of proud Pride and you check it doesn't just come boom proud don't know you know there's proud that is mature that you see this man he can't even walk properly that is that is now Pride it is maturity now how does a pride Spirit proud Spirit come to a believer sneaks in he he check it and you can only see it if you ask for that Spirit of sensitivity get the spirit of this element to see when the Devil comes closer to you Lord help me to see these things to see the demos when they come because when they come to me and you they don't come when like when they're good in unbeliever no the devil won't come to you and say hey I'm the devil today I'm visiting you he will never do that he's gonna start me something small my girl even in school something we call in English negligible something innocent and said oh and and he'll give her even a reason to say oh really no this is watch the response check the fruits check the attitude how I think of my sister or my brother's actions even if they are wrong that does not supposed to determine my attitude towards them I'm supposed to actually double the love you know that's lies that I spoke about where you put butter this side and this side yeah when the devil shows me something about I'm now supposing to apply more dosage of honey in my love for him I like that attitude I like the attitude that when someone when the devil because it's not actually your brother is the devil using the weakness of your brother or your sister to attack to make you conflict to make some a beef between you to make some it's not literally your brother that is why the Lord said forgive them for they don't know what they are doing that is why Stephen could say Lord forgive these guys they don't know they don't they are not even at Year One you know Year One we've got great great one grade two but before grade one and grade two we've got grade r we call it Reception class and we've got great RR those guys are not even at grade r they are blind the man is being killed he's being stoned he says Lord forgive them if we get to that man well the devil wants to make me think about a brother this way and I kick his tooth so far that he knows that with that he's not going to come to me even if my brother is wrong because I know if my brother is wrong it's still you devil I'm telling you how can you if you find blaming with other and the devil you know a guy who just come in the group and we find that we are fighting since he arrived here the devil must not come between me and you and then me and you are fighting now all these years who were friends but now we are fighting because we got a new visitor here why now I've got thoughts about David and David you know how the devil works this is how he works okay at least to me I don't know you you if you relate with this example you tell me you must check if the devil brings a wrong thought to your mind particularly about your brother more often than not he attacks both ways your brother could be having a similar thought or a similar a related demon could also be attacking your sister or your brother what he wants to do he wants to make to make the meeting conflict because he wants to cause something he knows if he just attack me attack me and my brother is just not caring or not not there there'll never be a conflict that's how the devil went but especially between husband and wife and especially between people that are close when he thinks about when when the devil attacks you on something he most likely check ask ask ask ask your friend what were you thinking just us expose the devil you'll find that if he's honest or he's honest you tell I was thinking that you're actually wrong about this the same thing was similar that the devil is attacking you towards him that's how he works most of more I've seen it in young people in groups I've seen it in marriages at least in my marriage I've seen it the devil attacks my wife and attacks me same thing I blame her she's blaming me of something who's wrong who's wrong none of us is wrong he's the devil so that's how he works all the time at work everywhere because it's even easier with unbelievers for us if we have got a discernment we can quickly see that ah my boss is just being attacked then you you you go above and you deal with it you you cover her with with messy you know so let's close with this um stand at the door you say you interfere with my private life this is now some of us sometimes tell the minister tell the pastor tell the deacons stop interfering in my private life there it is see well then you have a little another little door called Pride I did not even see this part oh my don't do temper with that now look brother I think is so much today all right in is your private life you say you've got no business busting in on my private life that's what you are telling Christ because there's no way in which I'm gonna come and stand here prayed up asking God Lord take everything about me aside and then I come and I touch on different things of different people how did I know how did the minister know now if I said no no no don't you touch on that private stuff or we have a more resentful Spirit a resentful attitude a slight softer resentfulness we are doing it to Christ so but this is to say hey Lord check me all the time even in my my inner inner in a bedroom check me there right are we together you've got to know business busting on your private life that's what you are telling Christ I'm talking from the word the word speaks for itself that's right this is from the message to loudisha 580609 I didn't paraphrase it I just read it for you and then in closing my brothers and sisters I want to say it is time for us to check it is time for us to take everything that disturbs us from seeing and say Lord Open My Eyes Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord you remember it was Zechariah in his house that he had been loyal and true wanting Waiting for God to give them a child and the angel Gabriel came to the house to the way to the house where did he come to the house are you with me Brothers I'm finishing this is the last quotation but be with follow me he came to the house it was a vision Mary who was who had lived clean and pure the Visionary where at that house right and waiting for a promise of God that he said that he sent an angel to right now he says the prophet here talk about running around with the world and fled with the world and then expect to see angels and have Miracles done is out of God's program you must live right clean up the house clean up your habits clean up the things of the world get rid of your cars and Wealthy Association get ready and then the angel of God can speak and say fear not it is high amen are we Amen in this I'm Amen in this I'm saying Lord if it's me please do it to me today I want to I'm tired of being a sinner I'm tired of being said I'm 40 years in the message where am I wealthy associations I can't be our outrages need people who are full of fire because when we go there on Saturday to the Outreach we are going to find people who are wrong people who need help people who wants you to be sensitive to their needs when we go there to the Outreach our young people need fathers and mothers who are full of their Spirit to help them they are setting up a foundation can you think about when your house is complete it only needs cleaning and I'm still putting my Foundation I need you more you are my father and you are my mother you're my uncle and my sister long in the word you need to help me to grow to finish building my house I've just been baptized I need support but how can you support me when your house is deity can you see that it's going to be difficult how am I going to tell that child I want your house to be like this you see the foundation when you finish we're gonna bike you meet but she comes to my house oh happy he means a stinking boot on the door in my house I prefer and you will start to say that okay can you see that I'm I'm I'm setting another example how is he going to train Japan feed and how is Joven going to say Bell can you see now what generation we are creating is q1 until a crap said to his children hey stop stop working like that walk like this and the kids walk like it guys can you walk straight how Mama Like This you know a crab goes like this they said Mama we are doing exactly what you are doing I say straight so it is this way then they walk like that that crap kill the whole generation because cannot walk straight but expecting the children to walk this is for mothers and fathers you've got to take it please and uncles we belong in this journey I know our length of being in the Lord does not determine anything anyway but we are expected to be good examples if you don't have a fire at least have a candle of firemen I'm not saying you have a big ball of fire just a candle so that the little guys can light up here the little guys can want to speak to you because they find the ways of encouragement they find the ways of consolation they find the ways of Surety and Assurance they find the ways of uplifting them helping them how to deal with their problems they phone you all the time because this is something that attracts them there's an attraction on the mountain that's what our young people must find and are you young people your challenge is to find that fire the fire is not going to come to you you're sitting like this and the fire no no he was looking for you but he wants your heart to be available let's not our let's not allow our rules to head towards Sodom while we say we're going to Cana may God bless you I I pray and I'm praying that this was something to take home to chew remember one thing if there's anything wrong that I
