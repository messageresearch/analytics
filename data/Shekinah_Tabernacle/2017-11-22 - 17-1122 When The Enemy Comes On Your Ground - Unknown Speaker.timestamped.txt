[30:02] bless you all
[30:03] trusty ones had a good first part of the
[30:05] week and even if you haven't praise the
[30:08] Lord amen so let's just go to first
[30:13] samuel in chapter 17 and then we're
[30:17] going to read we're going to go to the
[30:19] book of galatians this here in 1st
[30:29] Samuel 17 and 1 and very familiar piece
[30:36] of scripture I trust e-everyone
[30:39] it's the story of David and Goliath it
[30:41] says here in in 1st Samuel 17 and 1
[30:44] we're just going to read this verse now
[30:48] the Philistines gathered two gathered
[30:50] together their armies to battle and
[30:52] we're gathered together at choke off
[30:56] which belongeth to Judah and pitched
[30:59] between choke off and azekah in FS teman
[31:07] it's gonna read that verse notice where
[31:09] they are there in Judah they're not on
[31:12] the dardan the land of the Philistines
[31:13] they're in Judah then we'll go to
[31:17] Galatians 4 and 1
[31:24] the devil always stands in the wrong
[31:26] spot Galatians 4 and 1 it says this now
[31:31] I say that the ear as long as he is a
[31:35] child differeth nothing from a servant
[31:36] though he be Lord of all
[31:38] but as under tutors and governors until
[31:40] the time appointed to the Father even so
[31:43] we when we were children were in bondage
[31:44] under the elements of the world but when
[31:46] the fullness of the time was come God
[31:48] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[31:51] under the law to redeem them that were
[31:54] under the law that we might receive the
[31:56] adoption of sons and because ye are sons
[32:00] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[32:03] into your hearts crying Abba Father
[32:05] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[32:09] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[32:12] through Christ amen may the Lord bless
[32:15] his word this night you may have your
[32:17] seats now we read we read in 1st Samuel
[32:23] and I want to take if I could take a
[32:25] thought and sometimes I struggle to
[32:28] think of a title but if the devil's on
[32:31] your ground you have a right to kick him
[32:34] off we see you know we read here we read
[32:38] here in 1st Samuel 17 that the that the
[32:43] Philistines were camped in the
[32:45] inheritance of Judah now they were on
[32:48] God's there on God's children's land now
[32:51] David came from the tribe of Judah they
[32:55] were standing on his ground they were
[32:57] standing on his ground and because he
[33:00] was from Judah now remember he was
[33:02] anointed to become King so nothing that
[33:05] would could come into his Dominion could
[33:08] defeat him
[33:08] I meant he had the right any enemy that
[33:11] rose up in his Dominion either from
[33:14] within or from without he had the
[33:17] authority by by what the office that God
[33:20] had placed him into he had the authority
[33:22] to destroy that enemy to deal with that
[33:25] enemy he had the authority to do it and
[33:27] he had God backing him up I mean that he
[33:30] could enforce what God had made him to
[33:33] be he could use that office that God had
[33:36] made him to be and he
[33:37] stand in that office and he could defeat
[33:39] every devil that's why as a as a 13 year
[33:43] old or whatever age you know boy cuz
[33:46] Goliath if you read the story he stands
[33:48] it says bring me a man
[33:50] bring me a man to fight me he's standing
[33:52] in he's standing in David's inheritance
[33:54] and Judah he's standing in his
[33:56] inheritance he says bring me a man and
[33:59] and that challenge fell on the wrong is
[34:02] because that challenge fell on me is of
[34:05] the person that it belonged to
[34:07] hallelujah so now here was here was so
[34:10] so so so Goliath boys fell into those
[34:13] ears and something stood and David
[34:15] saying this devil this Philistine this
[34:18] uncircumcised Philistine he must leave
[34:21] my land he has challenged us to a battle
[34:24] I'm going to face the battle I mean I'm
[34:26] not going to shrink back from this from
[34:28] this foe though he's a giant though he
[34:30] may be a trained man I've just been a
[34:32] shepherd boy amen but God is I've been
[34:35] anointed by a god-ordained profit by a
[34:37] vindicated prophet of my age I've been
[34:39] anointed by him I mean to become king of
[34:42] this land so therefore nothing is going
[34:44] to stop me becoming king of this land
[34:46] hallelujah now let's just go to the book
[34:48] of Genesis quickly we're just going to
[34:50] read a couple of scriptures and Genesis
[34:52] chapter 1 I trust us built some faith I
[34:55] mean that no matter what the enemy has
[34:58] boasts you know the enemy boasts against
[35:01] us parents you may have some of them but
[35:03] you're not going to take them all with
[35:05] you I mean I remember brother bus call
[35:08] sharing a testimony winners girls were
[35:10] young the deal will seat you could have
[35:11] some but you won't have them all he says
[35:13] I'm gonna have them all they're mine
[35:15] Satan you have no right Amen you know so
[35:18] if there are your inheritance amen don't
[35:22] don't shrink back and say well maybe
[35:24] they don't mean to be there what are you
[35:26] doing about it as like anything sickness
[35:28] amen kick it off I'm in depression kick
[35:34] it off amen you know just the doubts and
[35:38] reasoning kick it off amen drive it out
[35:42] Alleluia now this is the whole world
[35:46] that we're gonna read about so there's
[35:49] the fourth day Genesis 1 and 14
[35:55] she's here thank God said let there be
[36:02] lights in the firmament of the heaven to
[36:04] divide the day from the night and let
[36:07] them be for signs and for seasons and
[36:10] for days and years let them be for
[36:14] lights in the firmament of heaven to
[36:16] give light upon the earth and it was so
[36:18] and God made two great lights the lesser
[36:21] light to rule the day sorry two great
[36:25] lights the greater light to rule the day
[36:30] notice their purpose the greater light
[36:32] is going to rule the day and the lesser
[36:35] light to rule the night and he made the
[36:37] stars also and he set them in the
[36:40] firmament of heaven to give a light upon
[36:41] the earth and to rule over the day and
[36:44] over the night and to divide the light
[36:46] from the darkness and God saw it was
[36:48] good so he placed this he plate and and
[36:52] this word that when it says made the
[36:54] word does not imply a creative act but
[36:57] declaring merely a functions as
[37:00] designating a function they are already
[37:01] there but God is saying this this light
[37:05] the Sun is going to rule the day and
[37:06] then the moon is going to rule it's
[37:09] going to have it's going to rule the
[37:10] night now
[37:12] when G Jesus is the light of the world
[37:14] he's the Sun he's the a so in this is
[37:16] natural the tongue spiritual now he's
[37:18] the SOE I mean when he was here he was
[37:20] it was the daytime Amen but now he said
[37:24] but now year he he said but now ye are
[37:27] the light of the world so he went away
[37:29] and then he came in 12th and his
[37:31] children and they became the light of
[37:33] the world and we understand the moon the
[37:35] Sun and the moon are symbolic I mean the
[37:37] Sun the issue in represents Christ the
[37:40] Esso in and in the moon represents the
[37:42] church because we don't have a light of
[37:44] ourselves we were really merely
[37:46] reflecting I mean the light of the Sun
[37:49] back to the stock world but notice there
[37:51] the purpose was to have dominion to rule
[37:54] I mean you're gonna the Sun is going to
[37:56] rule the day the moon is gonna rule the
[37:58] night hallelujah that means enter all
[38:00] means you're in touch I mean you're you
[38:04] you've got the head
[38:05] I mean you're not the tail you're the
[38:07] hit halleluyah says early singing
[38:10] creation I'm in my bride my bride will
[38:13] have dominion she's going to rule this
[38:15] dark place I mean she's going to rule
[38:17] this darkness and you're gonna say I'm
[38:20] part of that body I mean I'm proud of
[38:22] that redeemed number doesn't matter how
[38:24] big I am sure I am Randa I am said I am
[38:27] whatever I am I'm part of that number
[38:30] hallelujah so he's telling us now you're
[38:33] gonna rule Amen so if we get a rule the
[38:36] devil has to be under our feet I mean
[38:39] every working every weapon if this has
[38:41] to be crushed I mean it's got to be
[38:43] under our feet
[38:44] I mean we're the Apostle Paul said in
[38:46] the New Testament the devil be bruised
[38:48] under your feet shortly amen this is
[38:52] this is what the Bible's saying and you
[38:55] gotta so you got to look at the enemy
[38:56] that yo that comes against you cuz I
[39:00] know it comes against you it comes
[39:01] against me and you may try and deny it
[39:04] say everything's peachy but it comes
[39:06] against you he comes against you with
[39:08] reasoning is that really the truth is
[39:12] what your parents are doing is to really
[39:14] change them do you really think this is
[39:16] going to give you eternal life reasoning
[39:20] amen you know do you really think this
[39:23] is the the one this tens of thousands of
[39:27] different churches that say that they
[39:28] have Jesus Christ in them it's how do
[39:30] you know that you're not like one of
[39:32] them well I'll tell you number one we
[39:35] have direct answer God answering a
[39:37] scripture manifesting in Scripture and
[39:40] thus our that's why I put that quote on
[39:43] brothers and sisters I don't have it
[39:44] necessarily on me now but brother Browns
[39:46] preaching the court trial the trial of
[39:48] 1964 and he says can I take the witness
[39:52] stand any and he begins to speak about
[39:55] Malachi for revelations 10 7 Luke 17 30
[39:59] the Son of man being revealed he says
[40:02] God has fulfilled these scriptures and
[40:03] then he speaks a little bit more and he
[40:05] says now if I have said the truth let
[40:08] the God who you know let let God come
[40:10] forth and prove that it's true and he
[40:13] begins to discern this person's got this
[40:15] and this this is your name and this is
[40:17] what's wrong with you
[40:17] this is Rob's wrong with you hallelujah
[40:19] that was the son of man coming down that
[40:22] was now God saying I'm gonna take the
[40:24] witness stand hallelujah
[40:26] it's not just this little Kentucky and
[40:28] saying some things I'm going to prove to
[40:30] you it's not his idea I mean it's not
[40:32] some different religious movement this
[40:34] is me speaking I mean through the mouth
[40:37] of a prophet hallelujah I mean this
[40:39] message has been over vindicated and
[40:42] even as great as critics it is like a
[40:44] phenomena an incredible ministry you
[40:46] never find it at anywhere else so it's
[40:49] not just a movement this is not just a
[40:51] different Church this is different this
[40:54] is very different this is God coming on
[40:57] the scene that same God comes and he
[41:00] speaks to your life and he fills you
[41:03] with the same spirit I mean the same God
[41:05] comes and lives in you hallelujah so now
[41:07] when that same God was there with the
[41:09] Prophet and every every spirit death had
[41:12] to give up a young people that died he
[41:14] just spoke their name like a lady Mary
[41:17] died in the audience and he goes to tell
[41:19] her son Billy Paul go pray for her and
[41:21] and he says no daddy he just hears Mary
[41:24] and she comes back to life holy your
[41:27] brother Wade died in the service because
[41:29] of a complex he had a complex he's what
[41:31] brother Branham was preaching and he
[41:32] died and he got risen to life again you
[41:35] hear it at the end of a one of the
[41:37] services and you hear you can hear his
[41:39] wife scream he just died he didn't stay
[41:43] dead that wasn't it wasn't brother
[41:47] branham doing it
[41:48] are you gonna think about well what is
[41:51] this this is God saying this is me it's
[41:54] not him it's me
[41:55] and they takes on a whole new dimension
[41:58] because now here's God coming out of
[42:01] eternity and he's wanting to tell Adams
[42:03] fallen race I've redeemed you I mean
[42:07] I've redeemed you I have an inheritance

[43:53] age you know there's an anointing in
[43:55] this word this message poured out an
[43:57] anointing upon the earth hallelujah and
[44:00] it anointed all different kinds of
[44:02] things that come to their place because
[44:03] the rain falls on the just and the
[44:04] unjust
[44:05] I remember the anointing fell amen and
[44:08] the purpose of it really was to bring
[44:10] for the bride for Jesus Christ I mean
[44:13] but you know different things have come
[44:14] forth but there's a bride that's been
[44:16] gathered

[45:25] goats I mean he's just so churning in a
[45:28] land I mean we're not so churning we're
[45:30] in the inheritance I mean because it
[45:32] wasn't given it was promised him but a
[45:34] seed would would would dwell in the land
[45:37] ain't man it's just like many promises
[45:39] that the Apostle Paul would write or
[45:41] Peter would write their prophecy I mean
[45:44] it's really yes sir they're gonna
[45:45] fulfill it
[45:46] hallelujah they which are alive and

[45:54] had who had who had sleep who'd be
[45:56] waiting amen the did in Christ that
[45:59] would rise that was them but we the one
[46:02] that ones that are alive and remain how
[46:05] lujah I mean it was sitting there
[46:07] waiting thousands of years but then the
[46:09] children of the faith come here we are I
[46:12] find myself in this number and then now
[46:16] we're gonna live it out amen so David
[46:20] now listen friends we have an
[46:23] inheritance God's given your inheritance
[46:26] in Christ Jesus I'm gonna read you a
[46:28] quote I wish this would just be
[46:31] ingrained into every soul this is a this
[46:34] is from my commission in 51 he says
[46:38] you're taken out of the pawnshop that's
[46:40] right it's like cash converters that's
[46:44] right the only thing you have to do is
[46:46] accept faith in Christ and you'll walk
[46:49] out of the pawnshop that's all you'll
[46:50] walk out you'll walk free you've got to
[46:53] take him at his word doesn't mad
[46:55] how you feel though go looking for a
[46:56] feeling just say Lord I take you at your
[46:58] word I mean because the devil will beat
[47:01] you up and down with feelings because
[47:03] it'll never be enough and you can
[47:05] picture in your mind what could happen
[47:07] it'll never happen and you're sitting
[47:08] there just take God at His Word by His
[47:11] stripes you are healed I'm the law of
[47:13] God that heals all thy diseases the
[47:15] promise of the Holy Ghost is given to
[47:17] you and to your children amen the Holy
[47:20] Ghost is given to my promises given to
[47:22] my three girls because I received it
[47:24] hallelujah for the promise that you as
[47:27] many as the Lord our God shall call
[47:28] that's what His Word says he's our
[47:32] kinsman redeemer isn't that right that
[47:34] God was manifested in the flesh to take
[47:36] our place to be our kids to be a kinsman
[47:38] to us as in the Book of Ruth and Exodus
[47:41] and so forth how preachers teaches there
[47:44] how we'd become kinsmen to God and God
[47:47] came down and dwelt in his son Christ
[47:49] Jesus became kinfolks to us and he was
[47:51] our kinsman redeemer my phone just died
[47:56] but it says Allen here that's everything
[47:59] we lost because of the fall Calvary has
[48:02] brought it back to us everything we lost
[48:06] he's Adam and Eve there were gods over
[48:08] the earth this this is the Dominion
[48:11] anything that could come into their
[48:13] place Adam Adam was you know God of the
[48:16] earth so that means he was in charge of
[48:19] the whole thing he arranged it how he
[48:21] would sin came and his wife was deceived
[48:24] he fell with her to try and save her and
[48:27] then now this world goes into the hands
[48:30] of you know of Satan Satan himself he's
[48:34] the god of this world no we're not we
[48:38] are meant to have dominion look what the
[48:39] second Adam proved that he was lord over
[48:42] sickness every demon he conquered health
[48:47] he won he he conquered everything that
[48:50] could be conquered there's nothing that
[48:53] is not conquered
[48:54] I mean death has to be swallowed up in
[48:56] victory sure but he conquered death he
[48:58] rose again hell couldn't hold him I mean
[49:01] how couldn't keep him that term couldn't
[49:03] stop him I mean those Roman guards
[49:05] couldn't stop him coming for
[49:07] let's seal that they put on them and
[49:09] couldn't stop them coming for hallelujah
[49:11] and it's the same thing
[49:12] I mean denominational terms couldn't
[49:14] stop them coming out of history amen in
[49:17] the terms of this world couldn't stop
[49:18] you coming out hallelujah
[49:20] you had to come out because at a time
[49:22] appointed I mean they'll come out
[49:25] hallelujah we've come out of the terms
[49:28] of this world hallelujah
[49:30] so he concurred held this and the growth
[49:32] all the victory had here he had dominion
[49:35] over nature
[49:36] I meant everything hit the menu of
[49:40] everything a funeral that he went to
[49:43] never stayed a funeral amen Lazarus was
[49:46] food four days dead in the grave his
[49:48] body was decaying hallelujah and he just
[49:52] said two words three words Lazarus come
[49:56] forth and brother Bram says if he didn't
[49:59] say Lazarus but he had come forth there
[50:01] would have been a general resurrection
[50:02] because he is the resurrection and the
[50:05] life hallelujah
[50:07] here was a body that was rotting and
[50:09] they and the soul of the spirit of that
[50:11] man had gone someplace he would have
[50:13] been rejoicing here to be in Abraham's
[50:14] bosom
[50:16] and then he but then he hears a voice
[50:19] Lazarus come forth pulled him from that
[50:22] dimension into this time incheon and he
[50:24] wasn't in a sick decaying body that's
[50:27] healthy and well and he walks out of the
[50:29] tomb bound up on his grave grave clothes
[50:32] now well now that's now remember they
[50:37] that believe in me the works that I do
[50:40] shall you do also don't say oh but it
[50:45] means greater and greater is imparting
[50:46] eternal life know the works that he does
[50:48] you shall do also because there's now
[50:50] the same Jesus and a many membered body
[50:53] so if the Lord called us if he actually
[50:57] said going someone just died over yo
[51:01] decay it said in the body Eddie and you
[51:03] knew he spoke to you and he told you go
[51:06] lay hands on that body call them back to
[51:08] life again in my name it would happen
[51:11] it would happen because the same Jesus
[51:14] that was at Lazarus tumors in you
[51:16] I meant that Jesus proved every
[51:20] that Adam lost Jesus proved that he had
[51:23] dominion over it
[51:25] but then Jesus wasn't wanting just to
[51:29] keep it all for himself because the
[51:32] reason the reason that he proved that as
[51:36] he wanted to show you this is what a
[51:39] redeemed son or daughter does this is
[51:43] how a redeemed and son and daughter is a
[51:46] meant where every enemy must come under
[51:49] their feet and you've got also have such
[51:52] confidence you say well why does
[51:54] sometimes things Terry and and things go
[51:57] unanswered does it does it shake your
[52:00] faith it shouldn't shake your faith
[52:03] shouldn't shake your faith as I see it
[52:05] on Sunday Abraham for 25 years
[52:07] Isaac's coming Isaac's coming Isaac's
[52:10] coming / Isaac's coming and then Isaac
[52:14] here hallelujah because he knew because
[52:17] it had so become that promise had become
[52:19] part of him
[52:20] Isaac's coming and that was the father
[52:23] of the faith how much more the children
[52:25] of the faith the raptures coming the
[52:28] raptures coming the bodies changes
[52:30] coming the dead in Christ are going to
[52:32] rise we're going to walk on the streets
[52:34] of gold
[52:35] I trust it mean something to you I think
[52:38] about the resurrection quite a lot and
[52:39] it moves me I want to see it I want to I
[52:43] want experience it I want to before I
[52:46] even realize hey this is different
[52:49] hallelujah I do I really think about it
[52:52] quite a lot because we're living in that
[52:54] season you say you've just you've had
[52:56] too much Sun or something no I haven't
[52:59] something happened I read this and I
[53:03] didn't say well how am I gonna do it no
[53:05] he said oh I'll do it I'll do it
[53:09] do you believe it yes I do believe it
[53:12] how is it going to happen is it going to
[53:15] be a wonderful day is it going to be a
[53:16] terrible day sunny day you're gonna feel
[53:19] full of faith I don't know I'm not a
[53:21] details person I'm even a list of a
[53:23] details person when it comes to the Lord
[53:26] and how he's going to fulfill his work
[53:27] because he fulfills it by bringing it to
[53:29] pass and I don't know how he's going to
[53:31] do it
[53:32] I know I I've indicated prophet Toby
[53:35] is gonna come a sweep maybe there's
[53:37] gonna be changing these atoms and the
[53:39] very life that's in you is going to
[53:41] change this body hallelujah so I don't
[53:44] know how it's gonna work out but I know
[53:45] it's gonna happen
[53:46] amen we're gonna we've got to have faith
[53:50] and evidence things not seen real faith
[53:54] doesn't look at evidence are you feeling
[53:57] better you're not feeling better
[53:58] Sarah do you feel younger no Isaac's
[54:02] coming maybe she got a bit sick of it
[54:05] after a while but then there came a time
[54:07] where she had a visitation amen so don't
[54:10] get too worried Sarah Sarah data for 25
[54:13] years
[54:15] Isaac's coming maybe in the back of her
[54:17] head that old crank he's getting more
[54:19] crazy and old as he as he as he goes
[54:23] along because he probably said it even
[54:25] more because he's quite rejoicing it's
[54:27] even more impossible and it's more
[54:29] impossible but Isaac came but because
[54:33] now she had a visitation of God herself
[54:36] and Genesis chapter 18 and her heart was
[54:40] changed from unbelief to faith are we
[54:47] turning their cable girls gonna go to
[54:49] Hebrews 11 but we'll turn to Genesis 18
[54:51] real quick because if we read would just
[54:53] read a couple of snippets here but God
[54:55] became flesh and came down and had a
[54:58] meal with Abraham and then after they
[55:02] had had that if we go down to verse 9
[55:05] and they said unto Him where is Sarah
[55:10] thy wife and he said behold on the team
[55:13] this whole chapters for you you may you
[55:17] may be doubting you may be not so sure
[55:19] why these people so excited
[55:22] why's mum and dad so excited about these
[55:25] things why do they start shouting and
[55:27] crying and sometimes screaming why
[55:29] what's happened I don't know what's
[55:31] happened to these people why they so
[55:32] happy about it
[55:33] I don't you know and these people tell
[55:35] me in the world no this is now my
[55:37] friends say they're crazy and I don't
[55:38] know you know that's like Sarah doubting
[55:40] you got to become fully persuaded but
[55:43] don't worry if you think like that
[55:46] because it comes a time we where you
[55:48] know he's got to turn your heart to
[55:50] faith serious heart had to be turned to
[55:52] faith amen
[55:54] took 25 years but it happened so don't
[55:58] but Abraham knew Abraham had a
[56:01] revelation series part of this promise
[56:03] so her heart must be turned to faith and
[56:06] that's why the rest of us have to have a
[56:07] real I pray revelation
[56:10] these ones are part of the promise they
[56:13] must believe it God has to come visit
[56:15] them I believe you will so where is
[56:21] Sarah thy wife he said Behold on the
[56:23] tenth and he said I'll certainly return
[56:25] unto the according to the time of life
[56:27] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[56:30] and Sarah heard of a tenth door which
[56:32] was behind him so time of life speaks of
[56:35] a woman so according to time of life you
[56:38] could have the promised son he's talking
[56:40] to Abraham but he's not talking to
[56:41] Abraham at all he's talking to Sarah
[56:43] because Sarah had to believe Sarah had
[56:46] the belief Amen because it was out of
[56:49] Abraham and Sarah the promised son was
[56:51] going to come that's why Hagar you know
[56:54] having having what's as I'm having
[56:56] Ishmael that wasn't even part of the
[56:58] promise that's not where the promise son
[57:00] was coming amen and it's the same thing
[57:04] it's the same thing with us I mean the
[57:06] church in itself a 2000 years we wait
[57:08] for the promise of the body change and
[57:10] the church has been waiting for 2,000
[57:13] years then finally we've had a
[57:15] visitation of the Son of Man I mean
[57:17] we've had a visitation of the son of man
[57:19] a man he's discerned our hearts I mean
[57:22] he's shown us Here I am and this is
[57:24] according to time of life now is the
[57:26] season
[57:27] I mean we're gonna we're gonna we're you
[57:29] going to receive the promised son you're
[57:31] going to meet the Lord in the air
[57:33] amen this is prophecy don't read your
[57:37] Bible like a story book whatever you do
[57:38] now Abraham and Sarah we'll all them
[57:43] well stricken in age and it ceased to be
[57:44] with Sarah after the manner of woman
[57:46] she's well past menopause and therefore
[57:50] Sarah laughs within herself saying am i
[57:52] waxed old that I have pleasure my lord
[57:54] being old also and the Lord said unto
[57:57] Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying
[58:00] shall I ever surely bear child which
[58:02] amoled as anything too hard for the Lord
[58:05] at the time appointed I'll return unto
[58:08] the according to the time of life and
[58:09] Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied
[58:13] saying I laughed not for she was afraid
[58:15] and he said nay but thou did us love now
[58:20] Sarah the reason Sarah was not destroyed
[58:23] because of her doubt was because she was
[58:26] part of the promise now we in our
[58:29] unbelief should have been destroyed by
[58:32] God amen
[58:34] but because we're part of the promise
[58:36] because we're part of the promise there
[58:38] has to come a season where we don't
[58:40] laugh at the promise anymore you know
[58:42] you would probably think well really if
[58:45] you take some of the things I say you'd
[58:47] probably think I'm a bit crazy in a cow
[58:49] nor mind has this body gonna be changed
[58:51] where's the evidence of it ever
[58:53] happening before what do you mean the
[58:56] world is going to burn up and it's going
[58:57] to be a new heavens and new earth winds
[59:00] this ever happened like that before the
[59:01] world's ever been burned up before they
[59:04] meant they laughed at Noah it's never
[59:06] rain before scientifically proved that
[59:08] it that that that rain has ever fallen
[59:10] I've never fallen before he sounded
[59:12] crazy they meant they say you know
[59:16] because to the carnal mind it sounds mad
[59:18] but that's the thing you may just laugh
[59:21] at it these people are mad she laughed
[59:24] at it because it seemed impossible to
[59:25] her
[59:26] I'm nearly a hundred years old I can't
[59:28] have a child
[59:29] we've been married since we were young
[59:31] we haven't had a child then we can't
[59:34] have a child now it's impossible it's
[59:36] why she left how can I have pleased with
[59:38] my Lord and her you know how can I have
[59:40] a child she laughed because she was part
[59:42] of the promise she could not be
[59:46] destroyed amen
[59:48] hey follow everyone's gone very quiet
[59:50] maybe you're thinking I do I trust you
[59:52] out but you know we friends because
[59:57] we're part of the promise but they came
[59:59] a season where your heart was turned
[1:00:01] when he visited you and you began to
[1:00:04] actually realize a body change I believe
[1:00:06] it
[1:00:07] we're at the end of all things I believe
[1:00:09] it I'm one of those redeemed ones I
[1:00:11] believe it I'm the bride of
[1:00:14] I believe it he paid it all on Calvary I
[1:00:17] believe it I mean he's my Redeemer
[1:00:19] I believe it God became flesh and walked
[1:00:22] among us I believe it
[1:00:24] hallelujah I mean Malachi 4 fulfilled I
[1:00:27] believe it the son of man being revealed
[1:00:30] again I believe it
[1:00:31] hallelujah I mean we're at the end of
[1:00:34] all things
[1:00:34] I believe it why because your heart was
[1:00:36] turned from from doubt to faith amen and
[1:00:39] in Hebrews 11 it says this
[1:00:52] that season verse 8 of Hebrews 11 it
[1:00:58] says by faith Abraham when he was called
[1:01:00] to go out on to a place which he should
[1:01:03] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[1:01:06] and he went out not knowing whether he
[1:01:08] went by faith he sojourned at the land
[1:01:11] of promise as in a strange country
[1:01:13] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[1:01:15] Jacob the years of him of the same
[1:01:17] promise for he looked for a city which
[1:01:19] had foundations whose builder and maker
[1:01:21] is God because he may he met the maker
[1:01:24] of that city he met the king of that
[1:01:26] city Melchizedek through faith also Sara
[1:01:29] herself received strength to conceive
[1:01:31] seed and was delivered of a child when
[1:01:34] she was past age now here's the reason
[1:01:37] because she judged him faithful who had
[1:01:41] promised hallelujah because he she
[1:01:46] judged him faithful do you have that
[1:01:49] because she judged him faithful who had
[1:01:51] promised I mean you know I place that
[1:01:55] with every scripture I just get place
[1:01:57] worth put it on your fridge because she
[1:02:01] judged him faithful who had promised
[1:02:03] I mean before the first bomb drops the
[1:02:06] nuclear bomb drops the bride will be up
[1:02:08] and glory because she judged him
[1:02:10] faithful who had promised I mean the
[1:02:12] bride's not going through the Great
[1:02:14] Tribulation because she judged him
[1:02:16] faithful who had promised us why we
[1:02:17] believe these things amen
[1:02:20] I trust that because he is I've judged
[1:02:23] so when you judge something you look at
[1:02:26] evidence and you've weighed up the
[1:02:28] evidence and you've come to a conclusion
[1:02:30] he's faithful amen
[1:02:33] who's promised who who's given me the
[1:02:35] promise hallelujah so now that's how
[1:02:43] we've got to be we've got to judge him
[1:02:45] faithful well how's this all gonna work
[1:02:47] out I've judged him faithful that's the
[1:02:51] main thing that matters now David David
[1:02:56] knew he was going to be or not David
[1:02:57] knew he was going to be on the throne
[1:02:59] the enemy came into his life and you
[1:03:02] know the rest of story Goliath was dead
[1:03:05] David was alive
[1:03:06] because the enemy that's what happened
[1:03:10] your wife died now you say well that's
[1:03:14] just a story and you're trying to
[1:03:16] collect rose no I'm not David was he
[1:03:18] came from Judah he came out of this this
[1:03:20] was his inheritance
[1:03:21] the the Jewish people in the land
[1:03:23] actually were one because their
[1:03:25] inheritance was in that land now our
[1:03:27] inheritance is in Christ
[1:03:29] I mean he's given us an inheritance No
[1:03:33] so the enemy you know he tries to come
[1:03:36] unto your land so he tries to make you
[1:03:39] disbelieve the promise he takes your joy
[1:03:42] away he tries to rob you he takes your
[1:03:45] joy away he takes your peace away he
[1:03:48] takes your long-suffering away take
[1:03:49] tries to take your faith away
[1:03:51] does he not I mean he tries to take your
[1:03:54] joy of the Holy Ghost away I mean you
[1:03:57] the joy of your salvation your first
[1:04:00] love he tries to take it away and you've
[1:04:02] got to recognize here's a glass coming
[1:04:04] on my land yeah I mean he's trying to
[1:04:06] rob me of this promise someone say Amen
[1:04:10] I mean that's what he that's what he
[1:04:12] tries to do but you've got to recognize
[1:04:14] this land belongs to me
[1:04:17] this promise belongs to me hallelujah he
[1:04:20] says my peace that I give unto you and
[1:04:22] notice the world goes and then and the
[1:04:24] devil tries to stir your life up and
[1:04:26] make things all stressful and and you
[1:04:28] try and worry about too much things
[1:04:30] you've got to take your slingshot I mean
[1:04:33] you're going to take whatever you have
[1:04:34] in your in your hand hallelujah you were
[1:04:37] to kill you have done that enemy I mean
[1:04:40] brother Graham says you just get one
[1:04:41] person and family begin to sing they're
[1:04:43] going to testify first thing he says you
[1:04:46] know you've been cutting Philistines
[1:04:47] plumb to the walls hallelujah you'll
[1:04:49] have a victory time amen that's just not
[1:04:53] nice something nice I believe that's a
[1:04:55] reality oh but I've never seen it happen
[1:04:58] before
[1:04:58] I bet you if we win back there we're
[1:05:01] watching the battle between David and
[1:05:02] Goliath a lot every one every one of our
[1:05:05] soldiers would have said have you ever
[1:05:06] seen a shepherd boy kill a giant
[1:05:08] champion I've never seen it before but
[1:05:11] he's brave he's a brave lad who's the
[1:05:14] slowest runner you run behind me
[1:05:18] I don't know if I thought he'd kill him
[1:05:20] but it's the only it's the only option
[1:05:23] they had I'm not trying to say it as a
[1:05:25] joke but brother Brahim says the
[1:05:27] soldiers believed it could be done but
[1:05:29] no they knew it could be done killing
[1:05:32] the life but they didn't believe it
[1:05:33] could be done because if they believed
[1:05:35] that they would have done it themselves
[1:05:37] and so they know I've never seen this
[1:05:40] before how about you know I've never
[1:05:42] seen a shepherd killer kill they kill a
[1:05:46] champion like this well does that mean
[1:05:49] it can happen I don't know let's find
[1:05:51] out and and you know and David had never
[1:05:56] seen anyone he'd never fought the this
[1:05:59] kind of thing before but he says I've
[1:06:02] killed a lion and I've killed a bear and
[1:06:04] he put this this Goliath in the same
[1:06:06] category as those animals he says well
[1:06:09] if God helped me kill these ones I'll
[1:06:11] kill this one hallelujah he'd never seen
[1:06:15] it be done before but he did it because
[1:06:17] it was revealed to him now
[1:06:19] this is my land this is my inheritance
[1:06:21] I'm gonna take this enemies come on my
[1:06:23] ground
[1:06:24] hallelujah it's like it's like here's a
[1:06:26] kiyah the Syrians had eaten up all the
[1:06:28] land I mean but he trusted in God I mean
[1:06:32] he believed God would deliver them here
[1:06:34] now in the capital of the promised land
[1:06:36] amen here he is and he had confidence
[1:06:40] God will deliver us I mean and what
[1:06:42] happened God delivered hallelujah never
[1:06:46] worked for him it'll work for you amen
[1:06:49] will it not and it work for you and so
[1:06:52] and so and so David killed Goliath
[1:06:54] it never happened before but it but then
[1:06:57] it just happened a shepherd killed a
[1:06:59] champion
[1:07:00] amen and so we ran it and so we should
[1:07:03] never worry about well I've never seen
[1:07:04] it before I've never experienced it
[1:07:06] before is that in the scripture why
[1:07:08] don't chase a thousand doesn't matter
[1:07:10] what size you are one will chase a
[1:07:13] thousand ain't man one will check to
[1:07:16] chase ten thousand someone do the math
[1:07:19] and work out how many will chase just
[1:07:21] ask rupiah I believe those demons that
[1:07:24] came out of the river Euphrates we'd
[1:07:25] chase them and Shem go Shamgar steady
[1:07:30] his lane this is just end of the blood
[1:07:32] of bulls and goats she's under the blood
[1:07:34] of bulls goats
[1:07:35] sham guys standing in his land here he
[1:07:37] is his family just survived one winter
[1:07:40] they had been harvesting laboring and
[1:07:43] harvesting that just finally harvested
[1:07:45] their food I think we'll survive
[1:07:48] he just had little children this is what
[1:07:51] happens when faith rises we should look
[1:07:52] in the promise something moved
[1:07:55] he heard the heared the Philistine
[1:07:56] soldiers marching up the road brother
[1:07:58] Bram says and he had heard it the season
[1:08:00] before but this season was a different
[1:08:03] season I mean something moved he looked
[1:08:05] down at his children's faces I trust
[1:08:07] when we looked down in our children's
[1:08:09] faces we should see God we ever need I
[1:08:12] mean we've been walking on this earth a
[1:08:15] bit more than them and we've seen maybe
[1:08:17] too much and we don't want them to
[1:08:19] experience the same things we want them
[1:08:21] to walk to dwell in this land I meant in
[1:08:24] a greater way than we ever have
[1:08:26] hallelujah and he looked down the face
[1:08:28] of his children and his wife and he said
[1:08:30] no I'm the head of my house I'm just I'm
[1:08:32] just coloring in the picture a little
[1:08:33] bit of verses okay cuz it's like one
[1:08:35] verse in the Bible I remember but he
[1:08:37] looks down he looks at his family he
[1:08:39] says I'm the head of this home he comes
[1:08:42] the enemy he didn't have a sword he
[1:08:44] didn't have a militia he didn't have
[1:08:46] training he probably wasn't very strong
[1:08:48] but he grabbed the first thing he had
[1:08:50] his ox coat hallelujah brother M says in
[1:08:52] one place he jumps out the window I mean
[1:08:56] any and he goes at them and the thing is
[1:08:59] he done every one of those soldiers
[1:09:01] hallelujah and he became a judge over
[1:09:03] Israel why is that because the devil
[1:09:05] came on his land the devil came on his
[1:09:07] land he wasn't after them the devil came
[1:09:09] on his land
[1:09:10] and he knew devil you're on the law
[1:09:12] you've come to the killing place you've
[1:09:15] come to the slaughtering place you know
[1:09:17] in battles defensive battles you know
[1:09:20] the the defender they actually set up
[1:09:23] like an a siege they actually set up a
[1:09:25] killing zone when the attackers come
[1:09:28] have you read about that do you know
[1:09:30] about those things they set up a killing
[1:09:32] zone and then any attackers have got to
[1:09:34] get over that killing zone to get to
[1:09:36] where the defenders are yeah they do
[1:09:40] there's a warfare now it's got to be the
[1:09:43] same thing
[1:09:44] us amen there's a killing zone it's in
[1:09:49] our inheritance and it's everywhere it's
[1:09:53] everywhere
[1:09:54] it's in your home it's wherever you go I
[1:09:58] mean when the devil tries to come and
[1:10:00] put doubt on the Word of God and put
[1:10:02] doubt on who you are in him I mean
[1:10:05] because if he can if he can get you to
[1:10:07] think you're not a son and daughter
[1:10:08] member a son and daughter has Authority
[1:10:11] they're not a servant he just tries to
[1:10:13] get you think you just a servant I mean
[1:10:16] you'll never amount to anything because
[1:10:17] if he gets you to think that you're not
[1:10:19] a sudden daughter that means you're a
[1:10:21] servant that means you're under his
[1:10:22] Dominion again does he not try and do
[1:10:26] that you have to take him take your
[1:10:31] slingshot if it's warring against you
[1:10:33] you got to take him you gotta cast them
[1:10:35] out all right the devil comes into your
[1:10:39] house you have the authority we ever
[1:10:42] token I mean we have a we have a life of
[1:10:45] God I trust you doing you you have the
[1:10:47] brother Graham says that we ever took
[1:10:49] and the Bible tells us we ever token and
[1:10:52] it's a sure token I mean it's not the
[1:10:55] chemical blood of Jesus Christ because
[1:10:58] that is gone but it's a life that was in
[1:10:59] that chemical blood amen was released
[1:11:02] onto the believer and we have that token
[1:11:04] I mean he says now you must use that
[1:11:06] token
[1:11:07] I mean applying the token as an action
[1:11:09] that's a doing I met any any and he says
[1:11:13] you got a person living out of your
[1:11:15] house and the first place you get a
[1:11:17] person living of unbelief is out of here
[1:11:19] I mean it once it spreads out of here
[1:11:21] then you can print whatever else out of
[1:11:23] your house hallelujah and if you're
[1:11:25] purged out all the living you can apply
[1:11:27] the blood apply the Turcan amen and if
[1:11:30] the token has applied the devil con he
[1:11:32] may try and come in but he can't stay I
[1:11:34] mean he's got to go hallelujah and I've
[1:11:39] seen it happen I've experienced it more
[1:11:42] than once I mean it doesn't matter how
[1:11:45] you feel when you pray doesn't matter
[1:11:47] how you feel you take God at His Word
[1:11:49] and you tell Satan you say you know you
[1:11:53] know brother BAM talk to his enemy you
[1:11:56] know he talked to his enemy brother
[1:11:57] busco when he was about 14 years old he
[1:11:59] was in the first meeting with brother
[1:12:00] Branham series of meetings you go watch
[1:12:05] his testimony he says about it and then
[1:12:07] the first part of the meetings here
[1:12:09] sitting up in the back but then somehow
[1:12:11] one of the services here he said right
[1:12:13] at the front here right in front of the
[1:12:15] platform and his prayer line and people
[1:12:18] were healed in different things but then
[1:12:19] there was a girl the first time someone
[1:12:21] came with a physical ailment was a girl
[1:12:24] with crossed eyes and and from where he
[1:12:27] was sitting he could see the girl had
[1:12:29] crossed eyes could he he says you
[1:12:31] couldn't even see really like you could
[1:12:33] only see the white so it's crossed over
[1:12:34] that badly
[1:12:36] praise looks at the girl no change
[1:12:40] praise again looks again no change I
[1:12:43] don't know how many times he does this
[1:12:44] you go see his testimony and they need
[1:12:46] but school well the bus considers his
[1:12:48] little heart sink because here was
[1:12:50] something finally something physical and
[1:12:52] then and then but you know but then well
[1:12:56] it doesn't seem anything's happening but
[1:12:58] then he tells but then brother brother
[1:12:59] says now we're gonna pray again this
[1:13:01] time he addressed his enemy he said he
[1:13:04] prayed away he'd never heard anyone pray
[1:13:06] before and and the Prophet spoke to
[1:13:09] Satan and said Satan you have no right
[1:13:11] to hold this little girl he said the
[1:13:14] angel Lord told me if I can get the
[1:13:16] people to belief nothing can stand
[1:13:18] before my prayer I am believing they're
[1:13:21] believing now you have to go and then
[1:13:24] brother BAM prayed for it didn't even
[1:13:26] look into her eyes and lifted her up
[1:13:28] facing the facing the crown and her eyes
[1:13:31] were perfectly straight well ouya why is
[1:13:35] that because he addressed his enemy and
[1:13:37] you hear it many times on the tapes he

[1:18:28] different things happen
[1:18:29] he says judgment there's strike in the
[1:18:32] west coast few days after that it was
[1:18:34] the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska
[1:18:36] he's a lesser almost sunk massive
[1:18:39] earthquake but he sit down you have to
[1:18:41] do something he threw up the rock and
[1:18:44] that started it you have to do something
[1:18:47] that's why the devil wants to have you
[1:18:49] he wants to make you have a negative
[1:18:51] confession I mean he wants you to say
[1:18:54] I'm no good I can't really obtain to the
[1:18:57] promise I really can't be saved the Holy
[1:19:01] Ghost isn't for me it might be for
[1:19:02] someone else but it's not for me I've
[1:19:04] been too lost I've been too wrong I've
[1:19:07] been too far gone I can never do it he
[1:19:11] wants you to say those things but you
[1:19:13] got to take the opposite hey man jesus
[1:19:16] paid it all all to him I owe the Holy
[1:19:19] Ghost I don't know how to come but I
[1:19:21] know it'll come I mean the promises
[1:19:23] given to me I mean me and my children

[1:19:32] been sanctified to God hallelujah to the
[1:19:35] lamb you got to say it go say it in
[1:19:40] faith hallelujah remember a son son or
[1:19:44] daughter has Dominion that was Jesus
[1:19:46] showing his Dominion he and God always
[1:19:49] lives an example first you see this is
[1:19:52] what I'm gonna demonstrate cuz cuz to be
[1:19:54] a to make disciples to make disciples is
[1:19:58] to be an example it's not all
[1:20:00] intellectual study that doesn't make her
[1:20:03] that doesn't make a disciple a disciple
[1:20:05] is you live an exam
[1:20:08] in front of the people and it's by
[1:20:09] practical learning you become a disciple
[1:20:12] so that's why that's why he he gathers
[1:20:15] gathers the disciples do I don't know
[1:20:17] what the time is but I'm not too worried
[1:20:18] so yeah this is disciples and then he
[1:20:22] begins to show them a world they knew
[1:20:23] nothing about he shows the dead raised
[1:20:26] the sick healed the bread and bread and
[1:20:28] fishes multiplied the storm count
[1:20:30] walking on the water all different kinds
[1:20:32] of things cuz he's trying to show them
[1:20:34] now this is what I am you'll do the same
[1:20:36] thing hallelujah and then now that same
[1:20:39] God came and dwelt in his disciples and
[1:20:42] they didn't have to learn about a whole
[1:20:43] bunch of things they knew that same life
[1:20:45] that was in their Messiah was now on
[1:20:47] them I mean that's why they could stand
[1:20:49] before the Sanhedrin totally unafraid
[1:20:51] I mean totally just not worried they
[1:20:54] said should we please mentor please God
[1:20:56] you tell me I mean they were beaten and
[1:21:00] threatened and they they rejoiced I mean
[1:21:02] we've been counted worthy to bear his
[1:21:04] reproach and the gospel isn't all
[1:21:06] palpable and nice the real gospel isn't
[1:21:09] all shiny and happy and nice hallelujah
[1:21:13] but they overcame in their age amen and
