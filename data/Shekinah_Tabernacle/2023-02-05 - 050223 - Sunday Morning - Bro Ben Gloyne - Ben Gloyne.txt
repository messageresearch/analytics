said it would be so you can um take your seats this morning so we have an item and um you most of you would know we now and then we write a few songs here and then we generally have a bit of a practice that when we have a new one we sing it as an item first so this is a this is a new song um that we've got and it's actually more of like a bit of a choir song you know when we when we go to the conventions you know we kind of do a bit of a we usually do some sort of a group item this is more like one of those so it's like a it's kind of been written more as a sort of happy choir group song so maybe maybe once we learn it good later on we can the next camp we can maybe get some get your amazing voices involved and do some do a bit of cunning um workmanship on it with all the with the Shekinah choir you're keen on that yeah yeah that's it okay now we're going to need some help with this one it's like a you're gonna have to give me a Clapper it's one of those ones where you've got a clef okay but you gotta you gotta clap on the right time it's like the oh yeah okay so so I actually enjoyed some of the items there and they they are for the camps and I'm like man I have to write a song like that I want like a because it's kind of a pretty smooth beat to get into once you get into it so but I'll show you a way to clap okay and if you I'm relying on certain people to clap and others just follow along when you when you know it I'm trying to say it's a different some things are different than what you know that doesn't mean they're wrong it means they're different you

singing your praise next one he's you know I came to the Earth and I took my first breath and the cry that I made was singing your praise Shannon said that's a little bit too poetic but you know when we look at the birds in the morning and they sing out they we say you know that bird is singing praises to the Lord so I'm like you know when I turned up here you might think it was a cry for my mother milk whatever it was I'm like no man that was a cry praising the Lord I'm here I've manifested as a Son of God and that was what my first cry meant even though no one else knew that that's what it meant and that's what your first cry meant you're crying praises to God with your first breath next one uh yeah I have a reason to worship I have a reason to praise you I have a reason to lift up

all they can um amen we may be sitting in a hot building but we're here to avoid a hotter place amen so God bless you amen so here we are in John 7 from verse 37 down to uh we're going to read two down to verse 39 Familia piece of scripture I think but um he says here now in the last in the last day of that great um that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this uh spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified amen let's just bow hits in a word of prayer this morning if you want to be remembered and prayers you want to raise your hand to the Lord amen dear Lord Jesus you see all the hands that are raised Lord we're so thankful that your word is ever true Lord and truly Lord that was more than a song Lord you are changing us oh God we thank you Lord that Lord your word resounds with your own heart and that's the that's what I want to catch this morning Lord not just to learn about you Lord but to Lord to to to meet with you to have a real experience with you oh God that your word would become part of us Lord that would walk out of these doors changed and renewed in the spirit Lord may you grant that I pray we just ask dear God may you just move Among Us Lord May touch every life and Lord we just want to get ourselves out of the way that you can have preeminence in our lives that you can do what you want to do so take control of every heart of every Spirit here for your glory Lord we love you we thank you Lord we can be gathered this morning pray you bless each one Lord and also those who couldn't make it today Grant it dear God we lord as we've read your word we need you the great author to come once again and make it live that's you're the one we want to see oh God so may you granted in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you friends you may have your seats this morning I've been going through a bit of a kind of a series about the power in God's pardon and Grace and and I just want to kind of continue on in this uh theme a little bit here but you know it's amazing where you know you read about the um you know you read John chapter seven we and we won't read all of it but you know just to save time we're just going to cover it very briefly how it's amazing how you know Christianity is not just to sit around and debate and talk about who you think Jesus is where you know it's more than just arguing Doctrine or talking about well I feel the word is like this or I feel the word is like that or I think it means this because you know they would you know all the Jews were sitting around they were debating and talking well you know I Think Jesus is a good man or I think he's a bad man I think he's full of a devil I think he's Messiah and you know they were talking about all these things but they were really missing the point of him being there because the Lord said you know when you come unto me when you really believe on me out of as a scripture say out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water where so it's more than just a confession of Faith but there's a real change in life where God would come and step into the person would come and live in us and out of us would flow the Holy Ghost amen so it's very important that we that we that we um uh under not just understand this but we experience this where our lives are here to actually bless one another you know every gift and every life is not for the person who has that gift it's for the body of Christ Hallelujah so you know I just you know I'm just so thankful that you know he would people would debate about him and and talk about him many different ways but he's really saying no you're missing the point if you really believe on me out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water I mean as I would say in Isaiah 32 would say behold the king shall reign in righteousness and and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place from from the wind and as a covet from The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadows of a great rock in a weary land and the eyes of them that shall see him shall not be dim and the ears of them that here shall hearken the hearts also of the rest shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammers shall be ready to speak plainly I mean so we live in this kind of hour where where where this is no longer a prophecy but but it's here in manifestation in our lives where where a man shall be a hiding place from the wind from the from the cool blasts and you know cold blast of the devil you know where a man shall be this hiding place we know this hiding place is our Lord Jesus Christ amen where he would be a place you know hiding place from the wind and his rivers of water in a dry place you know I don't know if you've ever been in a situation where you can't just turn on the tap and water you know water doesn't run out when you turn on the tap you know water becomes very valuable it becomes a very precious commodity when you can't receive it it's easy to you know here we can just turn on the tap it'll just run until well it'll just keep running running because we get more rain than probably we you know get rid of but you know when you when you're in a place like when we're in bushback Ridge Brother Andy and I in December you know there'll be times where there'd just be no water running and you need to try and wash your hands you get bottles of water and yeah but it became very precious just a little bit of water that if it was coming out of the tap you just take it for granted but if it's in a bottle well it's it's an important thing and so so in a dry in a dry place you know he'd be a great rock in a weary land where where this word weary means it's a faint or a thirsty or a weary land now we live in a weary land it's a very dry you know people are fainting their hearts are fainting for fear amen we know mental illness has has skyrocketed these last couple of decades especially in the west is because man is trying to trying to find a satisfying place in their own ability in their own strength but they cannot find it you know there's no peace Amen in this world because the Prince of Peace has been turned down I mean but those who have received the prince of peace they have a peace that passes all understanding amen we can be living in the greatest trial of our life but if he is our Rock if he is our anchor I mean we can stand as sure as he'll stand not because we're depending upon ourselves but because we're depending upon him I mean that's the main thing if you know if if he really is our foundation if his word is our everything amen then then we can stand in every situation Hallelujah I'm so thankful we have a god greater than ourselves greater than the devil greater than anything he can throw at us we can stand amen because he stood amen that's the main thing you know it's amazing where you know we can we can look in the word of God and we can look at all the promises of God and you know everything in the Bible and the message you know that you're you know that's a promise to the bride Jesus died for us to receive right he did not just receive that word he didn't sorry did not just die the word receive forgiveness of sins though we have but there's Divine Promises of God that he died that we would possess amen and so it's very important when we look into these things we think how are we ever going to possess these things because it's amazing how man can can can go straight into the attempting with their own ability to possess the promises of God you know but we understand that it's not by our power or by might that we can ever obtain any promise it's by his spirit amen as the Apostle Paul when he would be speaking to the Galatians we know that the galatian church they go into a legalistic phase they're trying to because of the people weren't fully converted they're trying to bring an old way of life into the New and Living Way trying to bring the law into Walking with God and and and the Apostle Paul straightened that all out in the in the epistle to the Galatians and he comes down to a conclusion where he had saying Galatians 6 it say for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature I mean so it's not it's not keeping the law or your own ability or not doing or just being it's not being legal or liberal that are veileth or gives you power overcoming ability but it's being a new creation in Jesus Christ I mean that's the thing that avails that's the thing that causes us to overcome is when God takes our old nature and it dies out amen then he steps in and makes a new creation because remember we are not a patched up people I mean we are not a reformed people this is not a Reformation this is a transformation a restoration of a people back to the original faith of the book of Acts amen where God would live in a people amen walk and then manifest as word I mean that's what this message has come to achieve I mean that God would be restored back in the hearts and lives of men and women that he would his word would have preeminence in every life and I'm so thankful we can give him first place amen we don't just push him off in a corner somewhere but we give him first place in our life now you look we're going to look in the description see the benefit of doing that right because Christianity a lot of you know people tells people there's all the things you cannot do when you become a Christian all the things you lose but I think actually it's all the things you gain amen what do you gain well you can be free Of Heartache you can be free of Sorrow free of pain you'll be free of the fear of death amen free of the wrath of God you can be free of the devil's influence and control in your life you can actually be free Hallelujah not just free you know as brother Isaac said you know people say they're free but what are they free from right because some people say well I'm no longer a Christian I'm free what are you free from well you're you're free from the protection of God that's one thing you're free from the Rapture I'm free I can do what I want but I say I'm actually the freest person a Believer is free amen like the Apostle Paul would stand before king of gripper and chains and he was actually the freest person in that whole courtroom the king wasn't free the other people weren't free he was free why because he met God on the road to Damascus his life was transformed I mean he may have been in physical change but spiritually he was free hallelujah amen there's no Darkness over him no sin death sorrow pain it was all gone why because he made a new creature in Christ as the same thing with us today we can have that same kind of experience amen where God steps out of History touches our hearts changes Our Lives of the person we once were we're no more because that person's dead in the blood of Jesus Christ and we're walking on with God Amen so it's a new creation that's what avails amen it's so important I mean because as I was saying that it's that it's not just you know it's not just being pardoned from sin see Jesus died on Calvary not just to take our sins away he did that that he would step into us and live in our lives amen so it's one thing to say yes he died on the calvary for me but are you a beneficiary of his resurrection I mean because if he's alive amen Because He Lives we live also amen that his Spirit comes into us and transforms Our Lives now as I was saying before but you know before I went down that kind of Segway you know there's always a question how can we receive the promises of God how can we see the manifested now Abraham before he became Abraham asked God the same question where God would come down in Genesis chapter 15 and he would he would you know God would begin to tell him what he's going to do about about Abraham and Sarah would have the promised son and you know they would they would inherit and this would be their inheritance the promised land and all these different things and you know and then in Genesis 15 and 8 uh Abraham said to the Lord Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it so so he's because he's saying God I mean Abraham is saying to God you know but but this this um elieza of Damascus you know he's my Aaron you know I don't you know you know I don't have a son and houses how's this going to be continued down because you have told me that in me all nations shall be blessed and you know how's this going to happen and you know and then and then and so he asked the question whereby shall I know I shall inherit it that's a good question I think you know when God gives a promise we should be asking well how am I going to receive this promise how's it really going to be manifested in my life because you know there's a lot of promises in here Hallelujah and every promise of God has to be divinely given but then how's it going to be done and then so the Lord asks answers him this question he would tell him to and he'd say unto him in Genesis 15 9 maybe you want to throw it up Talia there and he said unto him take me a take me and hear from three years old and if she go to three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto them all uh all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds he divided are divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses Abraham drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep pardon me fell upon Abram and lower horror of great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abraham sure nervous surely that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that's not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with a great substance and thou shall go to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity the amorites is not yet full and it came to pass it when the sun went down it was dark Behold a a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces so God came down and consumed that sacrifice so God is telling because Abraham's saying how am I going to inherit this and God is basically saying I'm going to join myself to you in sacrifice that's exactly how you're going to inherit This Promise it's not going to be you that's going to do it but but by these sacrifices I'm enjoining myself to you Abraham that through me you will possess this promise now because this word whereby uh the definition is actually by which way or method so so Abraham is asking God by which way a method shall I know that I shall inherit it so what is the way or the method that I'll know that this promise is actually mine you know how am I actually going to know that this promise is not just some nice idea that's instagramable that you know that I can put on the fridge but how do I know it's actually it's going to happen it's going to be a reality it's going to be manifested in my life and God says well take these sacrifices and he was showing Abraham that he was going to join himself to God I mean join Abraham to himself by these sacrifices now this is so vitally important because if you really know the Lord if he's really joined to you by Sacrifice by Calvary amen you're going to realize that you're going to possess every promise I mean that you're going to be the one that's going to do it you know before we go down that road it's amazing uh just how as soon as this happens now God actually shows him how he's going to inherit it then the very next chapter Sarah tells Abraham to take Hagar and through him have the promised son so as soon as God gives a promise man automatically for some reason works out how can they fulfill it because because Abraham was told by God this is how it's going to happen so basically I'm going to do it I'm going to join myself to you and you're going to have the promised son but then man says well it doesn't seem to be working so let's try it a different way and how often do we take a promise of God and we lay our hands upon that promise to try and make it fulfilled because it seems like there's a time delay in the promise coming and that though though there may be a delay it will happen right Faith doesn't know a time limit amen we know time limits Faith knows no time limit I mean if you've really got a revelation in your heart that it's going to happen it's going to happen and you can walk on praising God that it's going to happen amen remember because with Abraham it was a revelation he wasn't hoping he was going to have the promised son it was revealed to him amen so he could just walk on praising God for 25 years knowing the promise was on its road but Sarah had not had a visitation Abraham had a lot of visitations but Sarah hadn't had one so she doubted the promise because it wasn't real to her because God hadn't revealed it to her yet but she was part of the promise so you know there's about 25-year span if I could say it like that you know of of of of of one of them getting the promise you know being revealed and then Sarah getting the promise revealed to her but they were both part of that same promise see things can carry on but hey if we're all part of the promise eventually we're going to catch up I mean but it takes God to come on the scene Amen to to speak to our hearts I mean for it to happen so in Genesis 18 God would come down in flesh we know there were three men came to Abraham and God I mean Abraham called one of them Lord right and that one one of them that one stayed with Abraham when the other two went down to Asylum to investigate what was going on and then so God would be sitting there having a meal with Abraham and Sarah was in the tent behind him and and and she was overhearing the conversation in Abraham would tell I mean I mean God would tell Abraham you know according to time of life I'm going to visit you you're going to have the promised son now time of life doesn't speak of a man who speaks of a woman so so he's saying no actually you know you're going to have the problem of son so he's saying according to time of life you and you and Sarah are going to have a child and she laughs in her heart saying how can this be because we're old and how can I know pleasure with my Lord you know this is impossible and God being the discerner of the heart said why did Sarah laugh then she came out said no I didn't laugh and he said no you did right but because she but the reason all that happened is because God had to turn Sarah's heart from unbelief and doubt and negative thinking into faith I mean God had to visit her and say no you're part of this promise get out of your doubting way see see we can't really lift ourselves out of we can get into a pit of depression or you know you're a melancholic or you're being unhappy or whatever we can be all down it really takes something greater than us to come down and lift us up out of that amen so God came down because he was not wanting to leave Sarah in that condition of you always yo complaining maybe about the planes of memory and the sand and the dust and the problems and the infertility and the impossibility of God's word being fulfilled you know because there comes a time when people just get annoyed you know it's amazing you think testimonies were just like the whole world on fire but some people just get annoyed you know people don't Rejoice necessarily but the person that it happened to they're rejoicing so there would have come a time when maybe Sarah would have said to Abraham stop talking about this I cannot go through this guilt and this pain in this hurt every month because you keep asking me is it happening no it's not happening you know there would have been a time we just she got sick of it because she was looking at her own body and its own failures right that that was actually she just thought well this is impossible for me to do it and then when she decides to give um Hagar to to Abraham she just gets jealous she just gets angry why because it's man trying to fulfill the word and it's a in In Their Own Strength but then God would come and give give her a visitation they're on the plains of memory and that's why it's so important that we keep a spiritual atmosphere around us that that God can step down into our lives into our homes and touch our family see Abraham brother Graham said well keep a spiritual atmosphere around them how do you keep a spiritual atmosphere around and praise God sing Psalms in your heart sing Melodies in your heart to the Lord remind them of his promises remind him of his goodness amen it creates a Thanksgiving crates of power around you that God can step into it's so important we don't focus on the negative it's so important that we focus on the positive negative thinking has helped no one if we had everyone from Adam all the way to down and we interviewed every single one and we asked them when you thought negative did it help you the answer would be no every single one and they would ask well what about thinking positive thinking about things of faith has Faith ever helped you we could have the Heroes of Faith stand so by faith this happened show us in a bad spot but God came and reminded me of his word of his Covenant and Faith came to came to the Forefront and Faith Delivered amen because remember worry and doubt has helped no one but faith can deliver that's why we should always have positive thinking never have negative thinking never think there's nothing in this for me or there's no point being here amen no there's no point the devil being here amen but you're a son or daughter of God Amen it's very important amen that we think positive Hallelujah negative thinking creates a lot of problems in our body stress anxiety is because of negative thinking a lot of it amen so we should always think positive in every situation Hallelujah why because that can deliver us Hallelujah amen so so Sarah had her visitation and then they had the promised son but even in between the time it's amazing you know it wasn't just Sarah you know Isaac you know we know it means laughter and it wasn't just Sarah that laughed a few chapters before Genesis 18 God would come down and remind Abraham of his promise and Abraham laughed in the in the presence of God laughing basically at God saying how can this happen yeah it's amazing how we can get to a point where we just kind of say this is impossible but if God has made a promise to you God will fulfill that promise amen shall we get to spots in our Humanity where we begin to doubt and question and worry and double-mindedness but God doesn't want to keep us in that way amen so this time so it wasn't just Sarah that laughed but Abraham laughed Hallelujah but because the promise had to come through them God was God was dead sure was going to be fulfilled and it's the same thing with you and I sometimes we can think how can we ever be the bride how can we ever go on a Rapture how can we ever overcome and yet God service after service amen scripture reading after scripture reading message after message will tell you you're built to overcome I mean your bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh you're part of me amen you're built to overcome this age you've been anointed To Tread on the head of the devil I mean to walk victoriously in this age you're built that way amen you don't become that way because of the new birth but because you are a subtle daughter of God you get reborn amen say you are a sudden daughter of God right hallelujah amen we are built you know when Jesus told John in the book Book of Revelation today that overcome speaking of this age they'll sit with me in my in my Throne as I've sat down on my father's Throne you know the Lord Jesus knew exactly the names of those who would be sitting in his throne because he knows the end from the from the beginning I mean so that that little phrase I'm in that I'm in that scripture holy I trust you can see yourself in the scripture I mean when it talks about the bride of Christ and those who have been redeemed by the blood of the lamb and Made In His Image you say my name's in them Hallelujah say well find your name in there well Benjamin John Glenn's not in there but by faith I see myself in there and God says that's you Hallelujah I'm not an Ishmael a wild man you know because remember man try to put their hands on the promise of God producing Ishmael and Ishmael was a wild man right we don't ever want to train in our own ability bring the word to pass it'll just make a wild man someone or something that's untameable to the word of God amen but when God does it it's perfect Hallelujah so that's why we should always just always trust and have faith in the promises of God just in his own character that God cannot lie he cannot fail amen we may not abide faithful but he is always faithful the scripture says amen that we can trust in our God no matter how dark and how scary how bad things may get we can look up because we know our redemption's drawing nine Hallelujah so now so now God would God would show the method that that Abraham would Abraham and Sarah would receive this promised son is that he would God would enjoin himself to them by sacrifice and God would change their names he would actually you know you know Abraham was changed to Abraham and and sorrow you know Sarah to Sarah right that H in the in the Hebrew alphabet actually speaks about the Breath of God so so God would Breathe into them his own his own life changed their names because we know a name represents a life you think of Moses you think about what Moses did right Peter you think about what Peter did Paul what Paul did amen because the name represents a life you think about the Lord Jesus and what he did and what he does praise the Lord so so when that when he changed their names he was actually signifying to them amen that that their lives were going to be changed so God would Breathe into them and change them and that's why the Lord Jesus before he ascended he breathed on his disciples saying receive ye the Holy Ghost the Breath of God was going to come into them and we know on the day of Pentecost he breathed into them the life of God came into transformed their lives praise God Hallelujah but he'd say you shall inherit this this is how you'll know because I'll join myself to you by sacrifice and that's exactly what happened that day on Calvary amen that God would enjoin himself to a people Hallelujah by sacrifice because we know that we could never keep you know we know this Covenant is unconditional just like the Covenant to Abraham because the one to Abraham was not if you do this I'll do that it's no I have made you right I have made you father of Nations and Abraham believed it and it came into manifestation right it's the same thing with us where he has told us we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we are sinless is here sinless because he became sin who knew no sin that would become the very righteous of God in Christ who believes that scripture amen so so he tells us these things and he gives us Faith to walk in them praise God God furnishes everything you know when we get there on that day there'll be nothing that we could ever inject into what he has done it'll be all the Lord praise God and I trust that we have that even today in our hearts it's all God Hallelujah you see the Oriental custom brother Bram says here but the auria until customers making a a a covenant was to kill a beast and stand between this beast and then ride out find um find uh over here find it in Leviticus they write out their agreement and that agreement is torn in two over this dead beast and they take an oath over the dead Beast that if they break this Covenant May their body Be As Dead As this dead beast and they give each one a piece then then they are sent away and when they come back those two pieces has the dovetail just exactly the same piece as how beautiful god making a covenant showing pre-showing it I've sworn that I'll do it in your seat I'll bless all nations of the world read it I'll bless the Gentiles I'll bless the black man I'll bless the yellow man I'll bless the white man I'll bless everyone through your seed for out of for out of you will come Kings and Priests and then how are you going to do it Lord I'll show you how and he showed him on a hillside where those pieces um where those pieces represented any Bible scholar here knows that each one of those was a clean animal that represented the sacrifice of Jesus Christ he was the ram he was the heifer that made the Waters of Separation when you had the Waters of Separation through how we have the washing by the Water by the word of the separation from sin through the word through believing and the pigeon turtle doves was Divine Healing and it's all in Christ amen and there God showed Abraham what he was going to do that through the seed of Isaac had bring forth his only begotten son Christ and was slain Yonder between heavens and earth when the sun went down the Blackness over the Earth and there he tore him apart he pulled his soul out of him and wrote a covenant with the families of the earth to me that's very powerful when that precious unadulterated blood of the almighty God dripping from Emmanuel's veins he tore out the soul out of him he said my God my God why is our forsaken me his face was full of mockery spit a crown of cruel mockery pulled over his brow his nails drove was Roman spikes his back ribbon until his ribs show through swing on the cross screaming dying a sinner's death the sin of the world upon him and their God Riven his sides he tore his soul out of him when he said unto thy hands I command my spirit and he dropped his head and the Earth Shook and belched out its rocks there he is there's God's covenant that's the fulfilling of it mid-rendering rocks and darkening Skies My Savior bowed his head and died the opening Veil revealed the way to Heaven's joy and endless day oh Calvary o Calvary Jesus bled and died for me there he tore the soul out of his own son separated a covenant and throwed his body into the ground there it laid for three days and nights it rose up if it was not possible that my Holy One should see corruption neither will I sit leave a soul in hell and a soul was his spirit that ascended into hell he rose down godded and picked up the body and gave him life and took the body of Jesus and said it at the right hand in glory and set back the Holy Ghost as a covenant amen because man God knew that man could never keep a side of the bargain right because if he said if you will I'll do this we're gonna fail just like the law Israel miserably failed because it was thou shall not Thou shalt thou shall not but because man had a fallen nature to begin with there's no way he could ever keep the law so God had to come and rewrite the nature of man amen give it change our nature from a one of sin and unbelief into faith in his word amen so so because God knew that man could never keep his side of the bargain he became the Dead one Hallelujah he became the sacrifice you knew that you couldn't keep it so he said well I'm going to keep it myself then amen so so that day on Calvary when when his blood was poured out of his body because of all the wounds he received the life in his blood was the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and then that life was released from the blood cell and it comes now back into God's believing children and changes their nature from from a sinner from unbelief into faith in the word of God Amen that's why it's so vital we receive the Holy Ghost amen that the life of our sacrifice comes into us and changes us Amen in the Old Testament we know that they would sacrifice bulls and goats and lambs and different things but you know the nature of that lamb could never come upon the worshiper and change them so so the very sin that made them come give the sacrifice in the first place they left with that same nature after they had given the sacrifice so they were justified by giving the offering but it didn't change them on the inside so even David with all of his sincere desire to love God and walk with God and he says I ever set God before my face that I stood not against him you know that was really all that all that desire it didn't change his carnal nature he was born with so when he saw bathshebra out the window that day all that was pushed aside and he went and committed adultery with her why because nothing could change his nature under the blood of bulls and goats but under the blood of Jesus Christ amen he has a transforming power that can change our nature amen that we don't just suppress things but God changes our desires that it's gone Hallelujah I'm so glad it's that way aren't you amen it's not us just trying to keep ourselves from sin or unbelief but it's God changes our nature like I've said many times when I was young I couldn't stand broccoli because there's just something in me I had no appetite for broccoli right but then one day I just you know something changed in my appetite broccoli ain't so bad after all right but something had to change in me that I like broccoli now right the same thing with you and I we're born with the nature we don't want God at all the scripture says there's nothing with us that seeks after him right so we don't have I'd say we don't have the appetite for him but then God does the work he begins to brood over our lives and call us to himself and we make a full Serenity changes us and our appetite changes for where once we love the world now there's nothing in us that wants the world Hallelujah like I've said many times I used to make Homebrew as a university student used to party up and all those things but now that desire was totally taken out of my life there's nothing in me that wants alcohol anymore I don't have to keep myself from it I just don't want it it's like broccoli when I was a kid I didn't want broccoli I would look at things and I see it repeated now I would see things on my place I don't like that never tasted it never had it in my life I don't like that Hallelujah and there's just things now it's like well you see things in the world I don't like that why because your Nature's change is gone praise God I believe that's what our God does Hallelujah now our lord Jesus is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life amen he is our satisfying portion amen he is more than an idea he's more than a Doctrine but he's a satisfying fountain that we can drink from and be satisfied and feel refreshed and rejoice and move on with him Hallelujah now but the thing is we have to drink it's very important that we drink we actually enter into a spiritual relationship with our Lord where it's not just in our heads but in our hearts amen it's very vital that we do this brother Brown would say that Christ is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life we are planted in him by the Holy Spirit and then and then we just drink from him every person that's a Christian he says the devil don't care how much you come to Christ as long as you don't drink amen you can stand at the table and your mouth watering saying well I'm here I'm here you but you're afraid to turn your faith loose see see and cry and see he says I love guns a man in the last meeting in Minneapolis the brother knowed my weakness I love to hunt and he gave me a rifle and oh how I love it of hunting and rifles and fishing he said I've got a rifle sitting here at home just to go hunting I'll never use it it'll never do me no good and when you receive the Holy Ghost everything you have need of for the Earth journey is in you then turn it loose and let it go to work let your faith loose and believe God well what do you mean by turn your faith loose let your faith control your life don't let your personality control your reservations or you know or or your nature or your upbringing don't let those things control you let your faith control your life that's how you let your faith loose see it's amazing when we when we look into the scripture there's many examples of people who let their faith loose who let their faith control or govern them more than their circumstances or their background you know there was a woman a Greek esophonician in in Mark chapter 7 and she had a daughter that was grievously vexed with the devil now she let her faith loose and and she was determined that she had to get to Jesus that her daughter would be made well now she had a lot of obstacles but her faith didn't have any obstacles you know people would tell her you know don't have anything to do with the Jews they'll have nothing to do with you who may be her pastor also said don't go and speak to that fanatic you know he's got nothing for you anyhow and you know but but her faith was was great and she was determined you know she just let her faith loose and her life and her faith led her to the source of her need I mean the one that could set her daughter free amen so we may have a lot of a lot of obstacles but Faith doesn't know obstacles Hallelujah see she was persistent I mean she was determined amen and then you know it's amazing when Jesus even when she got into his presence you know many times we think well we've gone to the prince of the Lord then it's all over actually many times that's when the battle really begins amen so maybe she got past the obstacles of her family and different criticizes her neighbors saying where are you going what are you up to and you know don't go down there don't go see Herman you know but but she pushed all past all that and then she got to the prince of of the Lord Jesus crying out all son of David have mercy on me and Jesus ignored her and her disciples you know would I mean his disciples were trying to discourage a different things and then she came before the Lord said Lord you know have mercy on me Lord and and the Lord Jesus said has not fit to give the children's bread to the dogs so he's basically saying it's not fit what I have to give to you but you see she had obstacles but Faith doesn't know any obstacles and she let her faith loose that drove her there amen see see when you let your faith loose it will not rest until it reaches its destination right she really see if she didn't actually let her faith loose at the first obstacle she would have quit got angry and walked on and told everyone how wrong Jesus is but no she had great faith and a great faith took her all the way through until she came to that place of humility saying yea Lord believe the dogs get the crumbs from the table and and and the Lord said of her great is thy faith she had great faith and he knew she had great faith amen but but the Lord had that in the scripture to show us a principle that if our faith if we let our faith loose if we let it drive Our Lives who's with me today amen because we don't want our uh our nature and and thinking what our neighbor thinks thinking what our parents think thinking what our children think thinking what our cousins think of thinking what our society thinks or whatever that will always hinder us we should never care about what anyone else thinks we think what about what does the Lord think I mean what does he think of me I mean we should let our faith loose until we get an answer because I believe our God is a miracle working God every promise in the Bible is true he's still as powerful and able and willing to do it as he did when he first did it I mean if we approach god with the same Faith they did we'll get the same results Hallelujah so so the Lord's the greatest thy faith and her daughter was was set free Hallelujah why because she lit her faith drive her amen When Faith catches a hold faith says it's so and Faith knows no difficult Faith knows no defeat when you've got faith you have perseverance you're going to push through amen you're saying perseverance this Greek had heard these words she believed it she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any faith knows no hindrance her faith had no hindrance she had but her faith didn't have you may have hindrance but if you've got faith it knows no defeat it's positive amen so we should really push on until you know we we need to get to a place where we don't care when you really don't care about anything that's when faith can be let loose if we care about what people think our outstanding or reputation whatever if you care about those things Faith can't be let loose to to to govern Our Lives see but we've got to get to a place where we just don't care now there is another woman in the scripture that had an alabaster box now you think about this she was going to she was going to swap her man-made alabaster box that had limited volume and it was just a man-made perfume in it for a Fountain of Living Water that was going to flow out of her being Holly she's going to swap a man-made container with a supernatural vessel I mean a man-made perfume that was limited in in what it could do just make things smell nice is all it could do to Fountains of Living Water that could raise the dead heal the sick quench a thirsty Soul bring eternal life bring healing Amen to the word we manifest in her life she swapped a man-made thing for a supernatural Fountain of Living Water but she got to a point where she just didn't care amen because she saw she wasn't invited to um Simon the Pharisees uh Feast but you know when she saw Jesus sitting in there with with unwash unwashed feet and and not made welcome it just really stirred her up you know God's going to get worship somewhere you know God will get praise God will get a genuine heartfelt worship from somebody and wherever he's invited he'll get it from somewhere you know it's amazing it's amazing it you know it was put on Simon's heart to to to to to invite the Lord Jesus to his Feast now his motives weren't pure but Jesus went anyway amen because Jesus knew there'd be a woman there that wasn't invited to the feast but you would come into the feast and her whole life would be changed amen but she got to a point where she just didn't care say she did not care that she wasn't on the guest list anymore she did not care that she might not be allowed in she did not care what the neighbors would think about her she did not care what her friends or family would think she did not care about the consequences she did not care what Simon said she didn't care about what anyone would say or do she just had to get to the Lord so her faith was let loose and it led her all the way to the Master's feet amen and then when she got that Alabaster Box she actually took all of her earnings and we know she was a harlot it's amazing God knows where we get our old life from but he doesn't turn away if we give it to him that will make a great exchange here's the greatest exchange to to receive life when you give him death right to to receive healing when you give him pain Hallelujah yo it's amazing he has the greatest exchange you think about it's the greatest exchange there ever would be I mean where where were these broken decrepit creatures Fallen by nature but yet we give our lives to him and he gives us eternal life he gives us his own nature he gives us overcoming power Hallelujah so she got to a point she didn't care about any of those things she just had to get to him I mean so so she got all all of her all of her earnings she went to the Apothecary you know got the got the most valuable uh perfume in the place and then she put her into a robe and then she just ran and somehow she got past the footwash flunky and those that anoint and kiss and make welcome and somehow she found herself at the feet of the master remember she didn't care see the devil always say you know don't say Amen what will this person think of you what about your friends at school what about these people on the job what about your family here what what about your wife or your children or what about your brother or sister he always tell us those things to keep us stuck right but but if we really get to a place where what is that good gonna do you know what good is that gonna do to me always trying to please all these people they just hold us back what about pleasing the Lord what about coming to him that he can change our lives amen peer pressures of the devil peer pressure is actually satanic right to try and keep people down and try and oh no you better not rise above you know there's such a tall poppy syndrome in this country everyone's got to become the same way we're not all the same way we're Sons and Daughters of God Amen who cares about what the critic says or what people will say you know but they'll never be my friends again if you meet the Lord God can get a hold of them right the thing that helped Abe um helped a lot was Abraham Walking with God that's the thing that helped lot right it didn't help a lot when when they were walking together and compromising having trouble is when they separated and God walked with God I mean Abraham walked with God why because he got pulled out when he was taken captive with the Kings and when they are inside and where was Abraham wasn't with them he was up on the plains of memory interceding for his family and God pulled them out Hallelujah so you know we're going to think about our friend you know what what what influence do people have on our lives now I'm not saying don't have any friends who are not Believers hey you're friends with whoever but you've got to be careful because I'll either drag you one way or you'll drag them one way amen so so may may our influence always be upon them and not their influence upon us amen amen that the law can get a hold of their lives and bring them into eternal life amen so so he she pushed past all these things and she didn't even think about the consequences where she got you know there's something when you get into the prince of God your own State yo you just can't hold it back you know there's no dried-eyed confession you know she just totally broke down and she took the alabaster box and she reached a point of no return where she could she broke it and she couldn't put it back together again it's the same thing when we really give our lives to the Lord Jesus you can't take it back you can't you can't assemble your Alabaster Box again you can't put the perfume of your life back in it's it's spilled it's on his feet holy your tears begin to come down and you just pour out your whole life and the Lord Jesus shouldn't turned her away he was there for her Hallelujah I believe he's here for somebody today amen when we get to a point where we just don't care push Puck let your faith turn loose until it comes to its destination amen you'll find your life will totally transformed amen she she walked out of there hey she had a lot of critics and the criticism actually went upon him if he really knew the kind of woman she was you know if he's really a prophet he wouldn't let her touch him you know all the criticism goes on that you know but she didn't care remember her worship filled the whole place her worship interrupted the whole party Hallelujah you know brother Brahm says you know may we get out of order long enough until one of us get saved you know we get so caught up in church ways and well this is just how we do it here but what about really getting a hold of God maybe because of the Holy Ghost inspiring it's in order right if God causes you to jump or shout or cry or whatever that's God that's Church order Hallelujah amen and then and then he would say to her your sins are forgiven you go in peace so now she was walking out with a totally different life Hallelujah she was now walking out with the peace of God God's Shalom upon her life Hallelujah and and I believe she went she went to the upper room she was one of the Believers so what so so she swapped a man-made box with a Fountain of Living Water I mean it wasn't some broken system she was drinking from some man-made tank anymore I mean but it was God's inexhaustible Fountain of Life Hallelujah and she didn't just come and drink it it was coming out of her Hallelujah and they said there's a big difference because in the Book of Revelation it says about those who come out of the Great Tribulation it says they'll be led to the rivers of Living Water so so there's a group of people on this side that it will come out of them but there's the people on that side they'll be led to drink to it they don't have it on this side see there's the wise and the foolish virgin the wise have oil in their lamps they have the Fountain of Living Water pouring out of them Hallelujah and there's those that don't have the Holy Ghost go through the Great Tribulation get eternal life then they drink them I'd rather drink now I'd rather have the fountain come out that when people come into my presence they get refreshed they have a cool drink remember they come troubled or upset or whatever more but then just just spending some time together maybe talking about anything they just get you know calmed down they take a drink they're no longer crying up yo everything's fine well he's a Fountain of Living Water this is a this is not just some Buzz phrase it's a it's got to be a reality it's got to be a reality amen but you see people are afraid of the new birth I'm just going to drop this in here people are afraid of the new birth they're afraid of it now any birth I don't care what level it's on it's a mess you take it out yonder in a pig pen any birth is a mess if it's in a pig pen if it's in a cow stable it's in a pink decorated hospital room I don't care where a birth takes place it's a mess a new birth is the same it'll make you do things that you didn't that you didn't think you'd do you might you might cry boohoo rub around on the altar no matter what you do he says I never ask God it wouldn't do no good to try and bring the new birth to my level see many people want want God on on their level on on their life on how they think it should be God if you're God you do it according to what I want that's not no God's not an errand boy he's not just someone we asked Lord do this and do that I want you to change this and change this no God's not he's he he's the Lord God Almighty he's the creator of heavens and earth he's not just some errand boy we can push around no he's God see many people just want him as Savior but not Lord he must be both amen so see I wouldn't want to try and bring the new birth to my level I want to meet God God's level of the new birth and receive it I don't care what I have to do see if you come to a point where you don't care what will happen then it'll happen someone said not long ago I'm afraid to receive the Holy Ghost I'm afraid that'll make me speak in tongues like them others I don't care if I spoke in tongues talked in tongues crowed in tongues or anything else I want the Holy Ghost that's the main principle I don't care what level it is I'll meet God on his level what he wants to say is right that's where I want to stand that new birth that changes a man changes a woman changes it changes a new desire changes their appetites wrestle with God until you can hold on until the blessing comes then God will change you like he said Jacob supplanter to to Israel who's a prince Hallelujah so so we've got to get to a place where we just don't care Hallelujah praise the Lord I believe I'm looking to people that don't care amen you burned every bridge you say Lord I'm I'm walking with you I don't care you can take the whole world Just Give Me Jesus I believe I'm looking at those kind of people Hallelujah Hallelujah so I'm just trying to find something amen praise the Lord I'm glad we can the Lord's so merciful to us we can just push through we don't care about anything and meet him amen so as I said it's not just a a buzz phrase out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water the Holy Ghost will flow out he says he says I'm planting the vine and where to plant it now Israel and Egypt was not planted they were just set out it wasn't their original home ground and a man that's a Christian that rests his eternal destination on some denominational Creed he's not in his right place he was born to be free a child of God to worship God but not under a Creed he can't bring forth his fruit yet something in him is longing to do it he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water Rivers plural water singular many rivers coming into the one channel in other words he'd be like a man in the scripture that believes all the word of God where the power and the nine spiritual gifts can flow through one God into his innermost being people don't believe in shouting the thing of it as they don't have spiritual joy and the joys of the Water of Life can flow through then there's a whole lot in the matter with with the Branham Tabernacle because it's unbelief and cares of the world has bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth so we've got to get to a place I'll say even here we can get to a place because of unbelief in the cares of the world that it binds us up to the water of God can't flow Hallelujah see if we believe all the word of God then the power and the nine spiritual gifts can throw a flow I mean through one God into our innermost being and flow out he says one thing say well I believe the word but but what's it doing in our lives I mean there's got to be a manifestation of that faith hallelujah amen and I believe that we are here in this hour amen for this to be so that's not just a confession but it's actually a possession of every promise amen say we've got to realize that God's quickening power of His Holy Ghost is essential and even as brothers saying the Easter seal is his tongues quickened together to a new Heavenly language speaking of the day of Pentecost to speak to them a rapturing up rising up into a different atmosphere that they ever have ever had lived in see when the Holy Ghost comes into a life you live in a different atmosphere you live in a different way of thinking different Outlook of life everything has changed because you're no longer in the fog and the trouble in the valley you're high up I mean above every storm you can see things for what they are who's with me today amen because why we are changing we are raised up into a totally different atmosphere where it's not troubles and fussing and fighting and drama that governs Our Lives as the peace of God in the word amen that govern Our Lives Hallelujah also with the new quickening life to them that comes in them it quickens their language they spoken new tongues oh yes now watch them it also was designed to give them after this abstract it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds every promise on the grounds of God's word that was promised in the Bible that quickening power was to give to them to Quicken the that promise to them therefore they laid hands on the sick they they was healed they spoke in new tongues they'd done great signs and wonders because it was in God's promise and when Jesus died to redeem that back to them the grounds that belonged to the sons of God he demonstrated what God was and he says how dare we try to socialize and put it into an organization we have no rights to do that it's the Holy Ghost today hunting out honest hearts that will believe the message everything in the Bible that was promised is to that believer and when we accept it in its fullness and God knows we'll do it he gives you the abstract to that that when every promise is made is in your possession and the Holy Ghost is there to Quicken that to you oh my what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see God's Great Holy Spirit here to do that power think of it when the Holy Spirit itself here to be a record of this hour Jesus said so he's the same yesterday today and forever he says how did any man try and wipe that out of there the works that I do you shall do also John 14 12. these signs shall follow them that believe that is the Assurance when we see a group of people sitting together and those signs manifesting themselves that's the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that's God's that's the property of God Amen why because what happens is like Abraham was asking the question how am I going to receive this and God says I'm going to join myself to you by sacrifice so the Lord when he died on Calvary his body amen we know it went down to Hell I mean your body went to the gravers he went down to Hell preached the souls in prison took the keys of Hell death in the grave off the devil ascended on high amen then he's on the right hand of the Majesty on high but his Spirit came down to the people and that show that they were joined to God by his blood by the blood of Jesus Christ amen so when the Holy Ghost comes unto you it quickens you to every promise that's in the word of God Hallelujah I mean so what kind of people should we be amen if we realize that every promise of God is ours because he has joined himself to us by his own death bear Resurrection Hallelujah give us such a boldness and Faith amen that every promise we should never take no for an answer amen because God's promises are true it may happen in a different way that we think it should because because really what we need to pray for is God's perfect will amen but if we look into a scripture and say lord it's in your will that we would prosper in health as your soul prospers right amen that our family and us should be saved hallelujah amen that we shouldn't be tormented in our minds you know it's one thing to have a mind battle but don't prolong the Mind battle don't don't why why entertain the devil day after day after week with depression and trouble and troubled thoughts and trouble going on no take the word of God yo brother Bram said it's like a farmer you know like thoughts we can't stop them coming into our mind but we can stop them roosting like a bird you know you're like there's sparrows out here now we don't take a shotgun but if you're a farmer saying there's annoying bird somewhere you can blast them out of the sky right stop them roosting amen but you see see it's like a thought you can't stop it coming we can stop it roosting you can stop it taking hold and taking taking control of your whole thought life so what do you do you take the double barrel shotgun of the Old and New Testament and you start blasting those thoughts and when you take the word of God and defeat every thought that's how you bring every thought captive to the word of God so so for example you know you're beginning to think well I'm never going to be happy again no but at him is the fullness of joy my joy I give unto you amen I'll never have peace no the peace that pass all understanding I'll give you I'll never be well well by his stripes I'm healed amen there's no way that my children or my family Protocols are coming home no believe in the Lord Jesus Christ I know my house shall be saved what does that do that blasts every negative thought out by taking the word and combating it oh yeah well we know I I can never go back to my first love but this is now a restoration I shall restore thus saith the Lord all the years that the Palm worm Cancun Locust caterpillar have eaten I will restore to you so oh it's been so many Wasted Years but I will restore it saith the Lord amen so we can take those things and blast them out of our mind amen what's that taking every thought captive to the word of God that's why we must be always be positive in our thinking amen always think on the word of every promise you know the only negative promises are towards the devil and him what did you say I'm gonna throw you in a lake of fire you're defeated you're gonna burn that's not my promise it's none of your promises either right our promises that will be made in His image we're Maiden is likeness where his workmanship yeah we can beat ourselves up so much about our Humanity I'm going to try and quit you know but we're going to realize where's his workmanship he's working on me I'm under construction hello I'm under construction he's molding and shaping me into the image of the word Hallelujah so we can just walk on with God can't we I mean he's a satisfying portion I trust out of you you see rivers of Living Water of the spirit coming out you're not fainting in a weary land but you found that rock of Refuge you found that River of Life Hallelujah and you're drinking every day rejoicing in his goodness Hallelujah praise our God I trust you see things that way amen that it's not just we become Christians and keep going on no we walk in newness of life what God actually changes our thoughts changed our desires changes all that we are to match his word praise God Amen let's have the musicians this morning we're just gonna we're gonna hit a hit a full stop or something amen let's walk on we have so many good things to look at you know you know we have so many promises and so much of the goodness of God to enjoy all of us you know you know Christianity is not you know I was reading a book about about boys becoming men different things from a Christian perspective and and the author says you know Christianity is not just telling people to be good you know the gospel is not just to be a good person that you know Jesus did not die or wasn't crucified because he told people to be good no he was crucified because he identified in the scripture who he was that's why the battle came but Christianity is not some Suburban lot that we live in that's just here's the boundaries and it's it's all it's all uh sterile and boring and no that's not Christianity Christianity is is Adventure it's a battle it's going into the Wilderness it's it's going into Uncharted places that's really what Christianity is it's not some boring you know we shouldn't be bored in church we shouldn't be bored with the word it should be exciting because we're walking with God he leads us into into sometimes very rugged places very even Dark Places bright places where it is but it's an adventure right it's an Uncharted it's going into Uncharted places brother Ram says there's untapped resources in God their people have never tapped into in his words what's that uncharted waters in a way so we should just say well Christianity is boring and we see it all and there's the fence and there's the house and there's the dog and no it's not Suburban never get in your mind that it's just this is all no there's far more to God than we have right his word this is all sitting here it could be sitting here for thousands of years but he'll take a predestinated vessel Quicken it to him and make it live why can't we be those kind of people the word has come open in this day and not the messages open the word right so there's parts of God that have been hidden for ages but now it's become into full manifestation amen so we should never be bought go possess every promise how we're going to possess it because he became one with me that I could possess it hallelujah amen let's um stand this morning praise God I don't know what to sing have you got a song from Isaac hey man that sounds very good amen we're more than able why because of our strength no his strength hmm how's it ever
