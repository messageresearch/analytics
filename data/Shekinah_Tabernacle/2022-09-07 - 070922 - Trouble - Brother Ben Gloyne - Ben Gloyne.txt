god bless you um we just want to uh before we go to the scripture actually we're going to read john 9 let's just let's just read and then we'll go into prayer we're going to read john 9 and verses 1 2 verse 3 just here just a short reading and then you can have your seats amen and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was born sorry which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind it's amazing how there's always a blame game begins to go away and jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him glory praise the lord amen glory hallelujah amen so we're just gonna um let's just bow here's some word of prayer we just have one prayer request so um one of my dad's old friends brian um so he's up in his 70s he's uh he's in hospital in waikato he's uh um his his uh his wife contacted me uh through facebook saying that brian's in a bad way um he was in the vietnam war and agent orange has got the better of him he's down to 54 kilos and they had to cut off some toes here you know he's he's basically a death store but my dad i made contact with my dad he's going to go down tomorrow and and see him and brian's not a christian so i believe the lord has orchestrated this that you know he can he can be ready i mean that's all we want really at the end of the road we're ready to cross that great river i mean the lord's there to carry us over i mean so if you've got a prayer request you know just raise your hand to the lord tonight amen let's just find our faith together as we go before the throne of grace tonight gracious lord lord we're so thankful truly how true that is lord will we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun lord with no less days to sing your praise than when we first begun oh god it'll just be eternity just praising you for what you've done for us lord you're so merciful lord your lord your you reach your hand way down for me oh god further than i could ever look up you reached down and got a hold of me and lord lord i'm sure we all have a testimony like that of your amazing grace and dear god we want to thank you we can approach your great throne lord tonight lord we know it's not by anything we could ever do lord it's by your blood lord that's that's that's the entrance you've

thank you we pray you just come take the service under your great control for your glory lord in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends you can have your seats um tonight so praise the lord it's amazing how i want to talk about trouble praise god trouble's actually a good thing brother brown would say in the in the message i know he says and why does god let trouble come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god there has been no rainbow until the flood came but after noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float 40 days and nights in the storm and little ark pitching up and down in the water and and after the flood was over that he saw the rainbow for the first time the covenant of hope the covenant of promise after he went through the tribulation then he saw the promise that's the way you see the promise after you've gone through the tribulation i mean he says i've liked that palm or some must i be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize and sell through bloody seas i mean you know we live in a day we yeah we understand trouble is part of life you know just because we're believers it doesn't mean we're exempt from trouble doesn't mean that god just puts a hedge of protection around us that we have no trouble we have no heartache we have no sickness but it's all part of life amen and you know what i love about this we just read and john here is that you know you know there's a question why is why is this person in this condition maybe you're asking yourself the question about your current state of life why are you in the state and it's actually the answer really is that the works of god will be manifested in you i mean just like this blind man amen that that you know the question was you know who sinned was it himself or his father or you know and then jesus said neither but that the that the works of god would be manifested in him you know it's amazing when trouble strikes we begin to be like job's friends you know job had some well you know friends you know because his friends didn't help him none really they just accused him basically after all their long dialogues and things they came down to the same conclusion you're a secret sinner job god's judging you that's why this has become upon you but they had no idea you know that actually god and satan had a conference and god testified of his servant job saying there's none like him upon the earth you know wouldn't you like god to testify to the devil about you saying there's none like them upon the earth they're my perfect perfect bride you know they're the apple of mine eye you know they've been made in my image and you know job had no idea that this conversation was taking place and job had no idea that actually of the confidence that god had him job he had no idea but you know it's one thing to have confidence in god but god's but god's got to have confidence in you and god does have confidence in you that's why he allows you to go through trials is because he has faith in you not your humanity not how smart you are but the seed he put in the in the inside of your soul that that's gonna hold amen so job had no idea that that though that that he lost his children he lost his livelihood he became sick covered in boils lost basically everything because god testified to the devil of how perfect job was yeah i mean now if if if god could testify of a man under the under the blood of bulls and goats about he's a perfect man how much for a people under the bride of jesus christ under the blood of jesus christ that their sins are not just covered but they're done away with that the very sin nature they're born with is eradicated by the power of the holy ghost i mean how much more are people like that hallelujah amen but you see we we somehow get a bit superstitious about when trouble strikes but we just read that trouble trouble god god puts bits in its mouth and causes it to bring us into a closer walk with god so really trial troubles are a blessing that's why it would say in the scripture count it all joy count it as joy you say i'm not feeling joy but counted as joy you've got to actually put it in your joy column saying this is joy right you may be feeling troubled apprehensive nervous worried upset but you got to drag that into the joy column as i'm counting this as joy that's what you've got to assign it as amen because there's god remember god is not an author of confusion he's not an author of frustration he's working all things all things work together for good for those that love god and called according to his purpose romans 8 28 so all things that's not most things is not some things all things all things that's a lot of things that's everything praise a lot but it's all working for our good but you see we can get into a condition where we don't see god's unseen hand but you see faith is more than a feeling and being full of faith does not mean it's a force field from trouble actually the more faith you have the more trouble you may face praise a lot hallelujah but people take it vice versa see but you see you know that's why we're going to you know job would say in job 14-1 a man that is born of a woman is of a few days and full of trouble amen praise the lord see the apostle paul you know some people think you know i trust no one has the idea that god is just a man with a big stick and he follows you around and as soon as you begin to put your foot halfway out of line he just wants to pop you on the head i hope you don't have that kind of revelation of god because if you do you need to get the real revelation of god our god doesn't follow his children around with a big stick and it at the slightest opportunity wants to just punish you that's not how i go no way hey i'm i'm glad someone knows jesus christ you get a bit worried when things go a bit quiet it's like really is sure he's not like that no he's really not like that sure he corrects us but he's got our best interest in mind but he's not just looking there like some grumpy i'm glad i don't live in the era of when people used to get physical punishment at school but you know he's not like some angry fussing teacher that just hasn't been dead against every child just wants to beat them as soon as they begin to no that's not our god that's not our god he doesn't work that way but he allows trouble i mean to bring us into a closer fellowship with him you know there's nothing the devil can do without god's permission and before he gets permission god has confidence in you right god is not stressing out will they stand the test he knows you'll stand the test because by us for knowledge he can see you're gonna come out the other side better stronger loving him more closer to him than ever before hallelujah do you believe that yes remember this is not a this is not a walk of survival all right and and you know we're just going to get through by the skin of our teeth no we're going to overcome we may go through great fire we may go through great hardship we may go through all kinds of things but we're going to come out the other side with a crown of gold amen so so if you have the idea that god has to punish you as soon as someone begins to walk out of line or the reason they are punished is because or the reason they are going through hardship is because they've gone out of line you've got to change your line of thinking because we could let's just take apostle paul as an example we know the apostle paul is the is the pattern of every true minister down through the ages he preached the word of the hour he had the manifestation of the spirit right but then he did suffer for the gospel sake and and the bible does teach us that there is a measure of suffering for the church that's right i'm glad no one no one's shouting i mentioned that's fine you know but because remember we would know him in the power of his resurrection we love that part of the scripture but then also the like fellowship of the sufferings right so it's all there but just because we go through hardship does not mean we've stepped out of line because sometimes people think your sickness strikes them oh something must be wrong no everything's going just fine everything's going just fine right but you just got to keep the thing is if you keep beginning you get superstitious why i saw an orange color on a flag and i've got a cold something must be wrong no no it doesn't work that way we've got to keep our eyes on the lord on his word not on things we think right so see let's take the apostle paul now i've actually started on page nine um so and this is not that irregular for me that's why slides i can get a bit i'm a bit allergic to them but let's go to second corinthians 11. let's look at this character paul so i just let's just see the walkie head let's just see the walkie hat second corinthians 11 and 22 do you want to do you want to start that up there that would be real neat he didn't just sit in an ivory tower of the holy ghost without any trouble right but yet he had such a revelation it didn't matter what came against me says none of these things move me none of these things move me from the faith he says i've known whom i have believed and in persuader that he's able to keep that which i've committed to him against that day what is that his soul amen that that god would take him into glory are they hebrews so my are they israelite so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more and laborers more abundant and stripes above measure whoa hold on all right hold on and prisons more frequent and deaths oft of the jews five times i receive 40 stripes save one oh hold on he must have done something wrong thrice was i beat him with rods once i was stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day have i been in the deep and journeyings often in perils of waters and perils of robbers and perils of my own countrymen imperials by the heathen imperials in the city and perils in the wilderness and perils in the sea and perils among false brethren oh my they're on pj awareness and painfulness and watchings often and hunger and thirst and fastings often and cold and nakedness beside all those that are without and which come upon me daily the care of all the churches so if we if we looked at the apostle paul now this may think some people think like this they think when trouble strikes they're out of the will of god if you apply that to the apostle paul he's the most unstable he's the most backslidden he's the most untrustworthy preacher that you could ever imagine he had quite a run he would he would go preach in one city and he'd have a revival but then jews from the previous city would follow follow him stir up the crowd that beat him or stone where he'd end up in jail and he'd go to the next city and the cycle would repeat that was his missionary trip how was the how was the accommodation well well that prison in philippi my terrible view zero star on google you know but that was that was his missionary trips and and and and a cold strikes us and we think as god left us you know when you really vocalize it it sounds ridiculous god hasn't left you he said i'll never leave him or forsake me i'll be with you wherever you go amen in trouble and good times and hard times he's the same god just because we go through trouble doesn't mean he hasn't forsaken us amen but the apostle paul because his faith wasn't a hope he wasn't i'm hoping the lord is pleased with me no no he had a revelation the lord is pleased with him why was he why why why did he get that revelation because he knew the lord jesus paid it all on calvary he could see that all the old testament shadows and types of the high priest taking the blood and into the holy of holies for on behalf of the people all the sacrifice everything was manifested in jesus christ and he knew that the blood of bulls and ghosts could cover sin in such a powerful way that god could not see it how much more the holy blood of god that was shed upon the earth on his behalf amen and he had the same spirit of god that wrote the old testament now dwelt on him by that same blood so he knew that jesus had paid it all when he wrote that he became sin who knew no sin that i'd become the very rice of god through christ that was a revelation that wasn't it what can i put that sounds good to put on instagram kind of a scripture that was a reality to him right so he had a revelation i am as righteous as god is righteous because he became me he was the sinner that i'd become him amen hallelujah and that's what faith should achieve right it's it's it doesn't matter about condition trouble just should bring into a closer fellowship with god hallelujah so i just encourage you put your torches and your pitchforks away when sickness strikes or trouble strikes oh there's sin somewhere we've got to do a real search just walk with god brother brown does say turn over every stone and then be certain of god but we shouldn't be always on the lookout for what the enemy is doing just walk with god he'll show you it's like how do how do people who examine money know what a counterfeit bill is they study the genuine long enough and they do that so they can see the counterfeit they don't necessarily just study the counterfeit they just look at the genuine enough and if you look at the genuine enough and the genuine holy ghost moving i mean you know the counterfeit spirit i mean you know when the devil whispers in your ear you're not good enough you're going to make it you're no good something look what you did you know the effects of his spirit amen so we should be able to rest and know my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they shall not follow that's what john 10 says does it not it says in the gospel of john so jesus did not say my sheep might hear my voice or sometimes they'll hear my voice no no my sheep hear my voice and says a stranger they shall not follow so you just listen to the voice of the shepherd the voice of the shepherd has spoken in this generation that's what this message is the voice of god has spoken to this generation that's the voice of the bible has spoken and if we know that voice amen then when the enemy's voice comes along we say hold on i know this this guy is not my shepherd this spirit is not my shepherd doesn't matter how wrapped up in religious piety and feeling sorry not just a humble kind of crippled up no you know god doesn't push us in a hole somewhere and say stay there for a little bit he doesn't have a naughty corner right sure we have to we can grieve his spirit and we can repent and he comes back but he doesn't say well you know it's not like with the police here where the punishment fits the crime so for example you do x amount of you do a certain crime you should get this x amount of years right you know normally in court they'll say well this previous case did the same kind of things they got this much and this other case did the same kind of thing they did that much then the prosecutor tries to you know give a set or get a sentence based on those two cases god doesn't work like that he doesn't say well you did this sure you've repented sure you know we're back in fellowship but you've got to sit in the naughty corner for a while god don't do that you repent and then you're free of the thing you genuinely repent say lord i'm sorry amen your friends think just keep walking on but the enemy says oh no you got to be humble you're going to be extra humble a bit longer and then you can earn your way back into fellowship no the only thing that earns you back into fellowship is a repentant heart and the blood of jesus christ pulls you back in amen so don't do a because you know people who do witch hunts really they're just anointed with the same spirit that was on the king of moab the king of moab got hired a prophet balaam tried to get uh god through balaam to curse israel the first time it didn't work see says well i'll just show you the back parts of israel show you all the nasty things that go on you know not the not the things that you know they would publish and not the things that look good out the front but uh all the nasty stuff that's going on in the camp and then so balaam saw these things and he gets anointed with the spirit of god now in his human mind he's thinking now surely god's going to curse these people but then now god begins to speak and balaam's got to hear god speak through his own lips and he says i see no iniquity in jacob i mean so that was that was god's response to what balaam was trying to balak was trying to do through balaam to get them to get him to curse israel i see no iniquity and jacob so you say well but you know it wasn't like they were sinless people now i'm not condoning sin okay but i just wanted to get a point across right it wasn't like they didn't have any trouble and there was no sin within the camp but because of the blood of bulls and goats god could not see it right now if sin is confessed amen it goes to the blood of jesus christ and it's gone people get worried about sitting in the church i ask you a question don't you think the spirit of god could call it out at any time don't you think that god could call you by name and call your address and say you did this on a certain day exactly this this is why you're thinking go down to the biggest detail don't you think god could do that i believe he can do it i've seen it happen god's called out sin but the reason he does that is to free the person under it amen so praise god so let's not get anointed with that kind of spirit when trouble comes and we think well there must be some secret sin going on in their life god will sort them out [Music] let's have a look at brother ron spencer who's seen his testimony i remember the first convention i went to in auckland uh brother andy and and sister brownie were there first convention ever went to my life i was on the front row it was awesome hallelujah what a powerful etrifying experience but he he gave you you know you know an account of a guy who tried to sell him life insurance and then brother ron he said no you can't sell me life insurance and the guy said okay try me he says well i've fallen off of roof 40 feet landed on my back on concrete broke every vertebrae in my body i've had a couple of strokes being bit my snake struck by lightning all these different kind of things and the guy said no no i can't sell your life insurance and that wasn't even and and by that stage he hadn't been burnt in the fire losing 70 odd at least percent of his lung lung capacity but god supernaturally healed that and he didn't have the stage for cancer that he has right now the doctors gave him over two years ago a month to live he's still preaching he's still preaching and when i look at that i say well if that man can preach and give himself to god what's my excuse i don't have a stage for cancer kind of excuse he still perseveres amen so some people think oh he's got to be a secret sinner no no before he came into this last trial the lord so before he even realized he had cancer the lord said if you trust me i'll use you like never before yes so even through that trouble god has used them like never before why that the works of god would be manifested i did all was it as parents is it the church is it him no that the works of god will be manifested that's why god has allowed that and you've got to take the same thing to your own life why am i going through this that the works of god will be manifested hey because god wants to as we heard last wednesday prove his word through you hallelujah amen praise the lord hallelujah amen but you see faith faith has a real rest but it's not just a sit back put your feet up kind of rest no it's a rest you know god has everything under control can you imagine what what it was like for um what it was like for joshua god had already spoken to him joshua won as i was with moses so i'll be with you he was under the mandate you're going to take the children of israel into the land and place them in their in their adoptive positions in the land based on their on their names imagine the burden that he would have carried because this this responsibility was on him yeah it wasn't on anyone else it fell upon him it was his lot sure he had he had crossed the red sea he had seen he'd seen the plagues come down in egypt he saw god come down on mount sinai he saw many incredible things he'd been in the prince of god with moses many times but now the commission had landed upon his shoulders and so the lord said you're going to do the job but so so you imagine the responsibility that he had he was there to fulfill scripture just like we're here to fulfill scripture i mean there's going to be a people that these bodies are going to be changed i mean the people made in the image of the word in completeness amen this is the hour we live in we're living in the hour of the resurrection we're here to fulfill that word what a responsibility all the believers all down the ages are waiting for you because they said us without them without us cannot be made perfect they're waiting for us to come to our position then the life of jesus christ within us will call them from the grave amen why the condition of the harvest dictates when it's going to be harvested right the the farmer doesn't get up one day and say i feel like harvesting wheat today no he waits for the wheat to become golden to bound the presence of the sun he looks at its condition says now is the season so the life within the wheat cries to the farmer i'm ready and the life within us is crying out to the lord where any lord hallelujah so now joshua's standing there he's crushed jordan supernaturally but yet now he sees the walls of jericho he's thinking how we gonna how we're gonna get this thing they had no battering rams they had no siege equipment they had no ladders they had nothing that they could use to take that city but then now a man approaches him with a sword drawn and joshua says are you for us are you against us he says no but i come as the captain of the host of the lord i mean so that was god an angelic form step down to the battlefield saying joshua i've come to take over your battle i mean and not just this battle but the entire campaign just like amen so he could now rest that the five seven star general has come down to take over the entire campaign that will give him such a rest not a hope a revelation a rest that god was gonna do it you know that would have been such a motivation let's take every promise let's take jericho then we're going to take ai then we're going to go take these other cities it would have been such a motivating force every part of this land is out amen let's go get it because god is here to give it to us i mean but so he would oppress them to me that's real faith it's he wasn't wondering are we going to take it no he was going to take it because god revealed it to him and god came down to tell him i've come to lead you to ever through every victory that's the same thing with you and i when the holy ghost really comes in you don't have to hope you don't have to try and build faith in your mind remember faith is not some mental assessment like working out a maths equation no faith is revealed to you that it's yours and when the holy ghost comes and takes over your life by a full surrender then it's like josh the captain of the host of lord take over joshua's campaign you can rest and then just press the battle because you have a revelation a rest that god will take you through every battle praise the lord amen so to me that would take out all fear that would take out all worry how's it going to work out while god's going to work it out oh does that mean you just kick back and relax no you press in because god has revealed it to you you're not hoping it's going to work you look at every divine promise of god you can have faith that in its season god will fulfill it right they took jericho but then they had certain order of battle they had to go through to take the whole land it's the same thing with you and i right you know there's pro yo you go into one promise then you go to another promise so for example repent and be baptized one promise you receive the holy ghost there's one promise i mean you can go to healing or restoration or something and god builds the character of christ and you see joy come into your life a peace that comes into your life the love of god comes into your life you see temperance come into your life patience with god comes into your life and you can rest because what you're getting victory but god ordains our steps hallelujah praise the lord so we can we can rest and we can have a real faith that what god has started he's going to finish hallelujah amen amen praise the lord amen you know abraham was the father of faith amen hallelujah amen he was an incredible believer he didn't have a bible he didn't have a church to go to he didn't have a preacher to preach at him didn't have musicians to lead songs in their song leader didn't have sunday school but he met god amen god called him god called him and he began to follow the voice of god now some people don't like the term progressive revelation but if you look at the life of abraham it was a progressive revelation because it started off saying leave this land i'll show you a land that's yours all right that was the first part of it and that first party didn't say you could ever promise something he didn't tell him the borders of the land that he dwelled in he didn't tell him that part of the promise is actually his seats going to go down to egypt come back 400 years later none of that so as he walked with god god unfolded the promise to him amen and then he came to a point in his life where he didn't laugh at the promise of god anymore his heart was turned to faith hallelujah so he came to a point where he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god now when he came to that point in his life it was physically impossible for him and sarah to have the child it was physically impossible but faith does not look at circumstances hallelujah remember the apostle paul was in a storm for 14 days and the ship was going up and it was going down and the clouds were covering the sun and all kinds of trouble going on but he wasn't looking at the storm he received a promise not in his ears but into his heart you're going to rome you're going to rome see faith has a rest i know my end destination what about all the details through it god will take you through amen god will take you through remember the prophet told us that nothing can take our lives till our purpose is done so nothing can take your life you can come you can be on death's door quite a few times but if it's not your time you're not going right but the lord can reveal to you it's your time and you can have peace hallelujah and really the outcome what does the outcome matter you know we we rejoice at the three hebrew children in the fiery furnace because they had fellowship with god in the fiery furnace but they would have been in paradise all the same if they never actually came out of the furnace hallelujah because remember their testimony was they stepped in there god harnessed that trouble because he wanted fellowship with his sons hallelujah and he decided i'm gonna have a private fellowship it's not gonna be here where everyone can hear it i'm gonna bring them into a furnace i'm gonna bring them to a time of trouble i mean they can worship me in the worst conditions possible which is a furnace hallelujah and sometimes god will take us into the worst conditions because he wants to have fellowship with you there many times we think i need to have the perfect sunset the perfect kind of vista on instagram then god can visit me no no and your trouble is where he wants to meet you he met the apostle paul and silas in a prison i mean just like he met him in a store so he can meet you in the same kind of conditions that's why you got to look up when you're in trouble don't look around don't look down look up because god wants to escort you through the trial and reveal himself in the trial hallelujah so we know they had fellowship with him there in the furnace but really if we cut a change the story a bit we go into paradise and we step into paradise just imagine one of the old testament believers we step into paradise and you happen to sit down next to shadrach meshach and abednego and their testimony would have been amen the king made this image of our friend we're not bowing to the image of a holy man we're not bound to the image of a prophet we we worship the lord god of israel we don't worship a prophet we worship the lord jesus christ around here we don't worship a prophet we don't worship brother brown we worship the lord jesus christ hallelujah i'll quote the apostle paul just as much i'll quote brother brown is that wrong amen if it lines up with the scripture it's worth quoting hallelujah so so we could so we're going to walk through the paradise sat down next and i said the king at our time was king nebuchadnezzar you won't find him here maybe you know anyway and he said unless you bow to this image you're going to burn we decided we cannot go against the word of our god amen and the last words that left our lips were o king live forever yes we're not going to batter your image either god will deliver us or he won't but doesn't matter we're not going to bow see that's real faith that is not the outcome that matters it's actually i'm not turning from god so their testimony could have been and we were thrown to the furnace the next thing we knew we were here right to me that would be just as powerful as them having fellowship with the fourth man right but god does things to show you that in trouble he has fellowship with his children hallelujah that when we're in trouble we can praise god and say god you're here in the furnace i mean because remember that furnace was was was burning seven times hotter than it ever was and this age is burning seven times hotter than it has in previous ages until we can come into this age with complex like they were tied up they didn't walk and they are thrown in so we can be tied up with spiritual amnesia not knowing who will work complexes pains things passed down from our lineage but in the fire with the fourth man i mean all those things are busted amen amnesia goes complexes go pain goes where he goes fear goes why because we're with the fourth man which is the lord jesus christ we can have confidence in our god hallelujah amen so abraham would stagger not at the promise of god it was impossible as i was saying for him and sarah to have the child but god said they were going to have the child he came to a point where god just revealed to him you're going to have the son amen it would take a visitation of god to both of their him and sarah to have it you know you can be the only one in your family that god has met don't think you're the only one he's ever going to meet brother brown with dramatizer on the planes of memory there you know lot was down in sodom you know mrs abraham was complaining about the desert and the dust and the tents and all the you know mrs lot was getting way better stuff down inside him but but sarah was complaining there and you know she was getting a bit fussy the reason why that was is because she hadn't had her visitation yet but because she was part of the promise she had to have a visit from god just like you and i i mean you may have not had a visit yet but i believe god is here to give you a visitation to turn your heart from unbelief to faith amen so god god god put on flesh him and two angels he blew some dust come here gabriel step into this michael step into this i want to go fellowship with my son hallelujah and then and the brotherhood says that abraham kept the spiritual atmosphere around him because he was under expectation that god was going to come and visit sarah so he wasn't listening to her complaining and letting it wear him down he was holding he loved her so much that he wanted her to have the same visitation he had right so he could look beyond her condition and say god because she's part of the promise you have to come visit her right so he kept a spiritual atmosphere around him and that's what drew got close halloween don't you love to draw him clock there's just something but the thing is he puts it on you but isn't it good yo you begin to sing something hallelujah you begin to praise god you begin to sing something and then the atmosphere changes the sweet humble feeling comes over you brotherham says it's the angels of god they've come to step into your worship but oh what's going on down here i'm going to spend some time in this and then god steps down into it hallelujah but he does it for a reason it's not just to bless you but it's for a reason so abraham created that kind of uh atmosphere then god stepped down into that and abraham's in the tent behind them and god says abraham where's your wife sarah and abram says she's in the tent behind you and and god says to him according to time of life you're going to have the promised son and she within her heart laughed saying how can this be this is impossible was actually making fun of the promise of god and god said abraham why did she laugh and she came out she laughed in her heart you gotta read genesis 18. and then he said i mean then she said no i didn't laugh he said yeah you did he said you're going to have the son right and that says after that keep reading then god visited sarah and then she had the son and then in hebrews 11 it says that she judged him faithful by faith sarah got the strength to to to conceive because she judged him faithful who had promised right so when you judge him faithful there's a rest in that amen because you're not trying to say can he do it can't he do it will he do it won't he do it no you've judged him faithful he's revealed it to you so it's not a hope it's an oso and then you can rest than that hallelujah [Music] amen so why does trouble come to bring you into a closer fellowship with god amen there must be sin in your life this is why this is going on not necessarily that the works of god would be manifested amen hallelujah so let's not be like job's friends let's not be like balak the king of moab trying to find the hindu parts of something let's just walk with god you know who the you know brother brown no the bible says that that a more powerful spirit could not be overcome by a less powerful spirit not at all so if god steps in if god is the strong man of the house right this strong man who can come in who can come in and bind him up and throw him out no one can amen right so if you've really received the holy ghost it should give you a really burly faith now we're uh you know we are not walking around terrified the devil's going to get us that's right you know the devil says i'm going to get you he says i've already been got by jesus the king of glory has already got me so there's nothing you can do against me that is not without his permission right and all things are working together for my god right if he is really the strong man in your life the lord is don't be afraid of the devil lord you don't go looking for a fight but you just keep walking with god the devil try and put roadblocks in your way you just keep walking through because no weapon formed against he shall prosper well what kind of weapons are they pride guilt shame envy strife unforgiveness bitterness resentment all those kind of weapons none of those will they'll try and be formed against you that pridefield coming oh look i've really made it right i'm in the third pole i am the third you know i'm better than this person that's pride i can't i can't forgive that per i don't have to forgive that person the judgment starts at the house of god and i'm judging them you know envy i can't oh that person got why do they get that job why they got more money than me this is not fair you know jealousy whatever more those thoughts begin to come but if the strong man is there and you know the shepherd's voice he'll say i'm not telling you that the devil's telling you that but those weapons will be formed against you but they shall not prosper they shall not win amen praise the lord let's just keep walking with god hallelujah why is it why does sickness and trouble and financial things happen too that the works of god will be manifested hallelujah if you could just take that home with you you'd realize that actually every trial in my life is for my good and god wants to manifest himself in that trial and actually nothing's out of cater it may look out of cater to the natural but to the spiritual living just fine and god will take you through it but you've got to be fully surrendered to him amen then you can just walk on and praise the lord that doesn't mean you're indifferent remember if something strikes you say lord is there anything in my life that's not pleasing to you you don't have to guess he'll tell you if you're really sincere if you really want to know he'll tell you see remember this is not a guesswork you know we don't have to guess god or guess our situation if there's really something lord have i done anything wrong he will tell you oh yes it's not well i think it's this because of this and this and this no no no he will tell you right and after you've turned over every stone just be certain of god that means trust god anyway and just keep walking amen so i think we can just rejoice jesus and trust the lord and i trust you've got a real faith that is resting because the captain has come to take over the battle and you're pressing the battle now to possess every promise i mean let's have the musicians tonight shall we amen amen let's just worship the lord a bit tonight thank you jesus our god is good we can just trust and i tell you we just trusted him he'll see us sorry every trial and may get to the edge thank you jesus amen amen but our god is our god is good you say i can't take it anymore but god knows what's really within you and he's not pushing you down a hole because you've done something wrong no he wants to reveal himself remember the fourth man only turned up in the fire he wasn't there when they were being challenged by the king when they be carried by the guards he was when they went into the fire that's when he revealed himself right it says the same thing with you and i you know our god but he was watching the whole time he was watching the whole time hallelujah i mean let's stand amen tonight i just want to sing that song my god is awesome he can move the mountains hide me from the rain i mean let's just worship the lord hallelujah thank you lord thank you amen we might pick this up another time but i mean we're going up for the youth banquet and and to preach up our brother ours on sunday so you pray for us that'd be that'd be real good thank you my god is awesome is he awesome to you is your god awesome hallelujah amen sometimes we think when we pray we should get the answer straight away no no no don't let time be a factor it'll come on god's timing we can rest and trust and give him thanks as the answer is on its way amen let's sing the my god is awesome he can move the mountains keep me in the valley [Music] strength when i've been weakened forever he

manifested in our lives lord you'd reveal yourself in a greater way of god that you harness trouble lord you put bits in his mouth and bring us a closer walk with you my god oh lord i pray you put such a rest in our hearts lord such a faith lord take the hope away lord jesus and put a real faith but a faith lord that reveals your word is true that you're in control lord i hope that your promises will work and maybe they will and if i've done enough they will happen my lord a real revelation lord that it is done father lord that you're working on our behalf you're leading us through

your works and your lies in jesus christ's name take your hands off the people you're a liar satan you have no right to misrepresent god to the people oh lord jesus i want to thank you father thank
