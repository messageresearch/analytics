[38:32] really love and appreciate you all and
[38:34] it's like to thank all the brothers for
[38:36] the construction that's going on so
[38:38] praise lord thank you for your Labor's
[38:40] as well we really appreciate it thank
[38:41] you
[38:42] amen our flight got um we got halfway
[38:47] across the Tasman on Friday we had to
[38:49] turn around so missed out on helping but
[38:52] anyway praise the Lord we made at home I
[38:54] mean you've got your Bibles handy let's
[38:57] just go to 1st John then we're going to
[39:03] go to we're going to go to the book of
[39:07] Matthew chapter 4 familiar piece of
[39:12] scripture to to us all sees this thing
[39:23] this then is the message which we heard
[39:26] of him and declare unto you that God is
[39:28] light and in him is no darkness at all
[39:31] if we say that we have fellowship with
[39:33] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[39:35] not the truth but if we walk in the
[39:38] light as he is in the light we have
[39:40] fellowship one with another and the
[39:42] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
[39:45] us from all sin I mean let's just read
[39:49] that last verse again but if we walk in
[39:52] the light as he is in the light we have
[39:56] fellowship one with another that's us
[39:57] and God having fellowship and the blood
[39:59] of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from
[40:02] all sin I mean let's just let's go to
[40:07] Matthew chapter 4 I sorry we have a bit
[40:16] more here if we say we have no sin we
[40:20] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[40:22] in us if we confess our sins he is
[40:23] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[40:26] and to cleanse us from all
[40:27] unrighteousness
[40:28] if we say we have not sinned we make him
[40:30] a liar and his word is not in us so if
[40:33] we walk in the light I see the light as
[40:34] blood cleanses from all sin amen and if
[40:37] we confess our sins he's faithful and
[40:39] just to forgive us right but it's very
[40:41] this is key fellowship Scripture with
[40:45] God it's very important it's going to so
[40:48] just let's go to Matthew chapter 4 and
[40:54] we're going to read verses 12 down to
[40:59] verse 17 if you see Tufts we pray so
[41:07] Matthew 4 and 12 it says now when Jesus
[41:11] had heard that John was cast into prison
[41:13] he departed into Galilee and leaving
[41:16] Nazareth he came into Alton Capernaum
[41:19] which is upon the Sea coast and the
[41:21] borders of Zebulun and Nephilim that it
[41:24] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[41:25] Isaiah the prophet saying the land of
[41:27] Zebulun and the land of Nephilim by the
[41:30] way of the sea beyond Jordan Galilee of
[41:35] the of the Gentile
[41:37] the people which sat in darkness saw
[41:39] great light and to them which said in
[41:41] the region and shadow of death life has
[41:44] sprung up from that time Jesus began to
[41:48] preach and to say repent for the kingdom
[41:49] of God is at hand amen
[41:52] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[41:54] Prayer gracious father we thank you we
[41:57] can be in your presence this morning
[42:00] Lord we thank you Father that we can
[42:03] read your word but Lord we know that
[42:05] anyone can read your word but it takes
[42:07] you the eternal author father you moved
[42:10] men of old by your Holy Spirit they
[42:12] wrote your scripture
[42:14] father I pray Lord that the same
[42:16] anointing that came upon them to write
[42:18] your word would come upon us the speaker
[42:20] and hearer father may your word living
[42:22] in every heart for these every need we
[42:25] carry every burden that we bear Lord I
[42:28] pray father that you would meet every
[42:29] need this morning father touch every
[42:32] life father may we walk out of your
[42:34] presence changed Lord like Moses did at
[42:37] the burning bush Lord you transformed
[42:38] him there father Lord of here's a new
[42:41] man dear god I pray father we would be
[42:44] new new creations father and I pray
[42:47] father you'd guide our thoughts today
[42:49] father as we go through your word I pray
[42:51] father your Lord your word may be very
[42:54] deliberate this morning father may it be
[42:56] with clarity and father we want to pray
[42:59] for those who are not here today father
[43:01] may you be their portion we want to pray
[43:03] especially for no Elias mom and
[43:05] Argentina Lord she had our believers our
[43:07] kidney removed
[43:08] father I pray your race her up law to
[43:11] full health father Lord may there be no
[43:14] more cancer found in her body makes you
[43:16] be healthy and strong Lord even without
[43:18] that organ father and Jesus Christ's
[43:20] name we commit her into your hands and
[43:22] we love you we thank you Lord in Jesus
[43:24] Christ's name Amen
[43:26] I mean God bless you all you may have
[43:28] your seats this morning I want to I want
[43:33] to dwell on a subject it's very vital as
[43:36] we as we read there in the scripture
[43:37] verse 7 there it says if we walk in the
[43:40] light as he is in the light we have
[43:42] fellowship one with another and the
[43:46] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
[43:49] us from all sin now sure
[43:51] sure you know we all agree we want to be
[43:54] cleans from Wilson we want the blood I'm
[43:57] just gonna be quite deliberate this
[43:58] morning
[43:58] so if you see Boreas well this is just
[44:02] how it may be gonna go I just want it I
[44:04] don't want anyone to misunderstand what
[44:06] I'm saying today okay I really want you
[44:09] to really grasp because the scripture
[44:11] you know we read you know we read the
[44:13] Bible that's God's Word and you know in
[44:15] print it's not man's idea it's not a
[44:18] just a collection of nice sayings or
[44:21] things this is God expressed right and
[44:24] this message is God expressed okay so
[44:27] heaven we're gonna go into that later
[44:28] but now Jesus says in John 3 if you've
[44:34] got your scriptures handy we're just
[44:36] gonna go through quite a few scriptures
[44:39] today now in John 3 and verse 16 now
[44:47] some of the some of it's on PowerPoint
[44:49] so it's not so John 3:16 it says for God
[44:53] so loved the world he gave His only
[44:54] begotten Son that whosoever believeth in
[44:57] him shall not perish but have
[44:58] everlasting life for God sent not his
[45:01] son into the world to condemn the world
[45:02] but that the world through him might be
[45:04] saved he that believeth on him shall not
[45:07] be condemned but he that believeth not
[45:08] is condemned already because he hath not
[45:11] believed in the name of the only
[45:12] begotten Son of God and this is the
[45:15] condemnation that light has come into
[45:16] the world and men love darkness rather
[45:19] than light because he deeds were evil
[45:21] for every one that doeth evil hateth the
[45:24] light neither cometh to the light lest
[45:25] his deeds should be reproved but he that
[45:29] doeth truth cometh to the light that his
[45:31] deeds may be made manifest that they are
[45:34] wrought in God now first I just want to
[45:38] establish what does it mean to walk in
[45:40] the light because it sounds like a very
[45:43] vague kind of a phrase but it's a very
[45:45] definite phrase because light and the
[45:48] Bible's when God fulfills his word that
[45:51] becomes light so when the word has
[45:54] manifested upon the earth that is light
[45:56] and the people that walk in that light
[45:59] they actually you know the people that
[46:01] receive God manifesting his word in
[46:04] their day an hour
[46:04] they're walking in light right we read
[46:07] there in Matthew chapter chapter 4
[46:11] because it said that the myth the people
[46:13] that said in darkness they saw great
[46:15] light and the light they saw was God's
[46:17] Word manifested here was the Messiah
[46:20] became flesh it went from prophecy to a
[46:22] reality Saul the prophecy speaking of
[46:25] the Messiah coming Jesus the Redeemer
[46:27] coming that was now become manifest as
[46:30] they were sitting in darkness but now
[46:31] light had come the wood had become
[46:34] fulfilled in their day an hour so they
[46:35] weren't sitting in darkness anymore they
[46:37] saw a great light now if we go to John
[46:40] chapter five we're gonna read about John
[46:43] the Baptist no one's gonna lay a bit of
[46:48] a foundation John five and and we're
[46:52] gonna read from verse 33 sees here ye
[46:58] sent unto John and he bear witness unto
[47:01] the truth but I received not testimony
[47:03] from men but these things I say that he
[47:06] might be saved he was a burning and a
[47:09] shining light and you were willing for a
[47:11] season to rejoice in his light now he
[47:16] said well hell was how was he the bright
[47:18] and shining light he was the he was the
[47:20] prophecy made manifested he was the
[47:23] voice of one crying in the wilderness to
[47:25] prepare the way of the Lord so Isaiah
[47:27] God prophesied it through Isaiah and it
[47:29] was there for hundreds of years waiting
[47:31] and then finally it became manifested
[47:33] and Jesus says he was a bright he was a
[47:36] he was a burning and a shining light and
[47:38] you're willing for a season to rejoice
[47:40] in his life the people that receive God
[47:42] rejoiced because he was the one who's
[47:44] introducing the Messiah and they that
[47:47] received John received the scripture
[47:49] fulfilled received the Messiah because
[47:52] John pointed out the Messiah so they
[47:54] said oh he's the one who's good a
[47:55] forerunner Messiah John the Baptist they
[47:58] received him and then they receive Jesus
[47:59] because they are walking in light I mean
[48:02] they're walking and the word manifested
[48:05] in their day an hour and that is always
[48:07] like you know it's very easy to go
[48:10] through the scripture and we say well if
[48:12] we lived in the days of Noah
[48:14] we had to receive knows message
[48:16] otherwise we would have drowned
[48:18] it's very easy to say looking looking in
[48:20] past three E's and say well of course we
[48:23] would have had to get in the Ark even
[48:24] though they offered animal sacrifices
[48:26] from just outside of it and all the way
[48:29] down to their the blood of a lamb
[48:30] wouldn't work and Noah's day you had to
[48:33] get in the boat
[48:34] you had to receive as preaching you had
[48:36] to receive as message in order not to be
[48:39] drowned with the world very elementary
[48:41] right Moses as day you had to receive
[48:44] the Ministry of Moses to go into the
[48:46] Promised Land right you couldn't just
[48:48] say well I'm a circumcised Jew I'm a I'm
[48:51] a covenant Israelite you know I'm God's
[48:53] chosen people
[48:54] you had to receive his word you had to
[48:58] receive his ministry in order to walk in
[49:01] the light and go into the Promised Land
[49:03] very you say well that's obvious God
[49:06] doesn't change right all of those you
[49:09] know Moses ministry was spoken of in the
[49:11] scripture it became manifested in his
[49:14] life it became light and those who
[49:17] received it walked in light John's
[49:20] ministry was the word manifested and
[49:24] people rejoiced in his light now if
[49:28] that's the same fear and God doesn't
[49:30] change then it has to be the same at the
[49:33] end okay has to be the same at the end
[49:36] where God because God doesn't you know
[49:39] being a Christian is not just being a
[49:41] historian right everyone can say I
[49:44] believe in Jesus on Calvary but when the
[49:46] same God that manifested and you know
[49:49] died on the cross comes a manifest in
[49:51] our day an hour then what do you do with
[49:53] it
[49:53] right because that's the you know that's
[49:56] always the challenge the challenge is
[49:57] not to receive a historical God the
[49:59] challenge is to receive that God in your
[50:01] day that's always the challenge so and
[50:05] that was the problem with the scribes
[50:06] and Pharisees they say we're Moses
[50:08] disciple they could point into history
[50:10] we believed Moses we know his writings
[50:12] we believe what he did that was history
[50:14] but the very God that Moses spoke about
[50:16] was in flesh in front of him and they
[50:18] couldn't receive him because their
[50:20] traditions blinded them from what God
[50:22] was doing in their day an hour and they
[50:24] are in darkness right because jesus said
[50:27] if you believed Moses you would have
[50:28] believed me
[50:30] they didn't really believe Moses even
[50:31] though they could court the scripture
[50:33] they could memorize it they could debate
[50:35] about it you know but they didn't really
[50:37] believe it
[50:38] cuz when the God that he spoke of was
[50:40] now in front of them they said no this
[50:41] is Beelzebub of nothung to do with this
[50:43] man okay
[50:46] now there but if one sees a lot of
[50:54] people say they walk in the light you
[50:56] know we could just quote that scripture
[50:57] we walk in the light the light as Jesus
[51:00] how wonderful it is but what is it as I
[51:04] said it's the manifested word for your
[51:06] day now there is a if someone is walking
[51:14] in light or walking in darkness you see
[51:18] how they're walking preusse what they're
[51:20] walking in now you know let's just take
[51:22] it naturally because everyone would say
[51:25] every Christian in the world say I'm
[51:26] walking in the light he's the light the
[51:28] light of the world but how they're
[51:30] walking how they're walking now I'm sure
[51:34] we want to everyone wants to be cleansed
[51:37] from all sin right God puts a qualifier
[51:40] in here we have to walk in the light as
[51:42] he is in the light then the blood of
[51:44] Jesus crisis and cleanse us from all sin
[51:47] we can't throw that out of the Bible
[51:49] that's in the Bible right we want to be
[51:51] cleansed from all service
[51:52] so we've got to walk in the light of
[51:54] what God is doing in our day and our now
[51:58] those who are walking now have you ever
[52:05] tried now this is just my words but
[52:08] let's just take it naturally have you
[52:09] ever tried to walk with his no where
[52:11] it's totally dark you know this is now I
[52:16] want to just go through these things
[52:18] because we want to look at now people
[52:20] who say they're walking in light will
[52:21] walk with God a certain way their life
[52:24] will show what they're in people walking
[52:26] in darkness will war will walk a certain
[52:28] way doesn't matter what you say jesus
[52:30] said by their fruits you shall know them
[52:32] so the life that is produced you will
[52:34] know what life isn't them by the life is
[52:37] being produced now you can be in your
[52:41] own home you can live that your entire
[52:43] but when you are surrounded in darkness
[52:46] you can't walk with confidence the way
[52:49] you can't win the lights on right just
[52:52] had the lights on you know where all the
[52:54] obstacles are you know where the
[52:55] furniture is you know where you don't
[52:57] stumble over things you just navigate
[52:59] yeah like if we for example had a fire
[53:02] drill right now and the lights on that's
[53:05] easy we will fire late everything's fine
[53:06] then we turn the light off and now we've
[53:09] got to go out you got to walk a lot more
[53:11] carefully right cuz you don't know where
[53:13] everything is now see you can take like
[53:16] your own home and you try and walk
[53:17] through it and darkness you can't walk
[53:19] with the confidence you do when the
[53:20] lights on anyone ever got up in the
[53:22] middle of the night kids are asleep you
[53:24] don't want to turn lights on you go get
[53:26] a drink of water
[53:27] you just stroll out into the kitchen you
[53:30] know get it get it off you go
[53:32] you walk careful because when you're
[53:36] walking in darkness you can only walk by
[53:39] memory right
[53:41] I think the eye I think the chair was
[53:44] there I think that was there you're only
[53:46] walking by memory you're not walking by
[53:48] sight you're not walking by Faith you
[53:50] just walking by what you've remembered
[53:52] what you've learned that's walking in
[53:54] darkness because you can think well I
[53:56] thought that was there you're walking
[53:58] too in the morning you'd go crash back
[54:00] into it it's so how did that get there I
[54:02] don't remember that big move and someone
[54:04] moves it because you're walking by
[54:06] memory you're walking in darkness you
[54:08] don't know it's there yeah people walk
[54:12] you can't walk by walk with God by
[54:15] things you remember well he used to do
[54:18] this you know I remember it way back in
[54:20] there I learned this by walking by
[54:23] memory something you learn right and
[54:27] people try and walk with with God by
[54:30] memory we don't walk with by memory we
[54:33] walk by his word as a light unto our
[54:35] feet right it's a light to our path and
[54:38] he is his word amen we're not walking by
[54:42] those who are walking in light and not
[54:44] walking by memory they know where
[54:47] everything is because they can see it I
[54:50] mean if someone moves the furniture when
[54:52] you're walking in darkness you will trip
[54:54] it up I mean you will you
[54:56] kick over the thing amen ever walked in
[54:59] darkness and stood on Lego it can be
[55:03] such a little thing but so much pain but
[55:06] if the lights on you won't stand on that
[55:08] piece of Lego but if you're walking in
[55:11] darkness you won't see it you'll stand
[55:13] right on the thing I don't remember that
[55:15] being there amen multitudes of people
[55:22] walk by a memory of who Jesus was 2,000
[55:26] years ago they all know about the man
[55:29] from Galilee we have to know about the
[55:31] man from Galilee right but he's not back
[55:33] - he's not a God of history he's a God
[55:35] of the present right if you want the
[55:38] full benefits of Calvary you have to
[55:40] walk in the light of your day I mean if
[55:43] we walk in the lightest here's the light
[55:45] you know the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:48] cleanses from all sin right so if you
[55:51] want the full benefits of Calvary you
[55:53] got to walk in the light and they also
[55:59] learn of who he is as opposed to knowing
[56:02] who he is today God's known by
[56:05] relationship right he's not known by
[56:08] learning we can learn we should read the
[56:09] Bible listen to the message we should
[56:11] study but there's not the ultimate God
[56:14] takes that because you've got to give
[56:15] something God to work with just like a
[56:17] prayer life you know or church or
[56:19] whatever you gotta give something God to
[56:21] work with and God works with it but it's
[56:23] not the ultimate the end is hit when he
[56:25] comes down anoints that word anoints the
[56:28] message anoint your prayer yeah and it
[56:30] becomes a living reality I mean you can
[56:33] know all about someone but when you meet
[56:35] them it's very different right you can
[56:38] know all about your whoever in the world
[56:40] some celebrity but then when you're
[56:42] finally in their presence and meet them
[56:43] that's a very different kind of
[56:44] experience you cannot walk confidently
[56:48] when you're walking in darkness you have
[56:50] to walk with caution someone who's
[56:54] walking in darkness will ultimately walk
[56:57] and fear and they lose where they are
[56:59] they lose where they are they men we
[57:04] were flying over Brisbane last night and
[57:06] when we flew in the daytime you could
[57:08] say well there's the river the
[57:09] is this you can see all the landmarks
[57:11] and then when you're flying in darkness
[57:13] that's to say exactly the same flight
[57:14] path you fly over exactly the same
[57:17] things but then because you're trying to
[57:18] look out by a memory and see where you
[57:20] are you think well I think this is this
[57:22] and this is this and you find that you
[57:23] actually totally wrong because the next
[57:26] morning we flew over it again say no
[57:28] that wasn't the river no this was this
[57:29] and this was this and we were totally
[57:31] losing our bearings with of we work
[57:33] because we were in darkness and we're
[57:35] but we're trying to work out where we
[57:37] are by memory walking in darkness if
[57:41] you're in the dark and unfamiliar
[57:43] territory it produces fear right that
[57:47] produces fear you know we don't have
[57:50] predators in this country
[57:51] well four-legged ones anyway we are the
[57:55] kind of predators but you know if we
[57:58] went into Africa or say America aware of
[58:01] these big big land predators you know
[58:05] and you just go out I'm just gonna go
[58:07] for a walk and the bush in the nighttime
[58:09] you don't think you're mad you're gonna
[58:12] walk through the Kruger in the nighttime
[58:13] even in the daytime there be a bit of
[58:16] fear but in the dark and in the
[58:18] slightest break of a twig you know
[58:21] things you you know it can just be a
[58:23] little mouse or something breaking a
[58:26] twig but in your mind it's this big line
[58:28] that's gonna chew you up in a second
[58:30] because you're walking in darkness so
[58:33] everything that is unfamiliar people
[58:36] become paranoid and they live in fear if
[58:39] they're walking in darkness if you're
[58:41] walking in light you can see it for what
[58:42] it is and you're not afraid I mean so
[58:47] where are you walking today are you in
[58:50] darkness you have to agree with the
[58:52] light to walk in the light the light is
[58:54] a person right it's not an idea the
[58:57] light is a person Jesus is the light of
[58:59] the world
[59:00] he's the manifested word amen now if
[59:05] you're walking down a road in the dark
[59:08] and there's a hole in your path that's
[59:10] all I'll say if you're walking down the
[59:12] road and then it's light time and you
[59:15] see a hole in your path you're not
[59:17] afraid of the hole you don't get scared
[59:20] of the hole or the potential care
[59:23] there be potholes on that road of course
[59:25] there'd be potholes eventually on a road
[59:27] you'll find a pothole you'll find a
[59:29] crack you'll find something you can trip
[59:31] over but if you're walking in the light
[59:33] you're not afraid of the hole you're not
[59:35] scared of it you just keep driving you
[59:37] just you move around it sometimes you go
[59:39] through them to make sure they stay
[59:41] where they are you know but you're not
[59:43] afraid but then if you're driving down a
[59:47] road you know I've driven down roads
[59:49] with the potholes here potholes but they
[59:53] look a lot bigger in the dark because
[59:56] the moon is shining you can't see how
[59:57] deep it is and that and that produces a
[1:00:00] fear because what if you brake your
[1:00:02] vehicle so you know you're not if you're
[1:00:08] walking in light you're not afraid
[1:00:10] because you can see you can see in the
[1:00:13] light I want to let up I want these
[1:00:15] things to mean something I want you to
[1:00:18] think about your life and where you are
[1:00:20] we shouldn't be afraid of potholes in
[1:00:23] life or the enemy might do this oh he's
[1:00:26] out there he might do this I have you
[1:00:28] heard about it
[1:00:29] we're not here to breed fear a walk with
[1:00:33] God is not about questions and fear but
[1:00:35] did this really happen that he really
[1:00:37] say this yeh hath God said I'm not
[1:00:42] interested in the serpent and what he's
[1:00:44] trying to produce what is God producing
[1:00:47] God has said this is my word this is me
[1:00:50] brother branch stood there multitude of
[1:00:52] times you know I'm waiting for something
[1:00:54] I'm just your brother I'm waiting for
[1:00:56] him to come the angel of the Lord and
[1:00:58] those who are in the meetings they they
[1:01:00] said you didn't need him to say he's
[1:01:02] here if we knew he was there yes such a
[1:01:05] holy presence came down I mean a being
[1:01:07] stepped into the into the place everyone
[1:01:10] knew God was there but the thing is they
[1:01:13] saw the angel of the Lord they saw the
[1:01:15] miracles they saw the ministry that was
[1:01:18] far beyond and the Nixie services I want
[1:01:21] to go into it to show you what history
[1:01:22] said about it far beyond any of brother
[1:01:25] Brandon ever contemporary he didn't have
[1:01:28] any ministry parent you know the same
[1:01:30] level as him they all saw the miracles
[1:01:33] they saw the discernment they saw the
[1:01:36] vision
[1:01:37] they they knew the angel was with them
[1:01:39] but they couldn't they couldn't place a
[1:01:41] ministry in Scripture and that was where
[1:01:43] they that was their problem they
[1:01:46] couldn't see the ministry in Scripture
[1:01:47] just like the scribes and Pharisees even
[1:01:49] though John stood they said I'm the
[1:01:50] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:01:52] and they fell out there because they
[1:01:55] said tell us who you are so we can go
[1:01:57] tell them who sent us this is John
[1:01:59] chapter one are you Elijah their prophet
[1:02:02] that restoration prophet no I'm not him
[1:02:04] well who are you then I'm the voice of
[1:02:06] one crying in the wilderness to prepare
[1:02:08] the way of the Lord
[1:02:09] well he's a man placing himself in
[1:02:11] Scripture you would think that go when
[1:02:14] they went back or filled out their
[1:02:15] report or whatever they did you think
[1:02:17] they would have said you know when their
[1:02:19] boss said to them what did he say well
[1:02:23] he quoted to us I was our 40 in verse 3
[1:02:25] you think that would have been good
[1:02:28] enough he's a man identifying himself in
[1:02:31] Scripture he knows where he is Jesus
[1:02:34] Jesus said he was the voice of one
[1:02:36] crying in the world that's Jesus said he
[1:02:37] is the one to prepare the way for him to
[1:02:39] come he identified himself in Scripture
[1:02:41] and so you think well if this man is
[1:02:43] saying he's this ministry and here he
[1:02:45] standpoints out this man Jesus of
[1:02:47] Nazareth behold the lamb of God that
[1:02:49] thanks to Anderson in the world you
[1:02:50] would think now if you had a question
[1:02:53] you think well let's just see what this
[1:02:55] Jesus does and if he is something it'll
[1:02:59] be supernaturally proof that this is him
[1:03:01] and it would go beyond the argument well
[1:03:04] he's made to be born in Bethlehem but he
[1:03:06] lives in Nazareth he was born of
[1:03:07] Bethlehem they didn't dig deep enough to
[1:03:10] see the truth of it that was their
[1:03:12] problem and dig deep enough to find the
[1:03:14] truth and they should have just sat
[1:03:15] around and they should have just watched
[1:03:17] Jesus in his ministry and they were said
[1:03:20] this man's different
[1:03:21] this is not something hatched up by
[1:03:24] because John and Jesus were I think
[1:03:26] second cousins according to the flesh
[1:03:28] you know that you know they would have
[1:03:30] said because someone to see it all this
[1:03:32] is just something these people have just
[1:03:33] hatched up to start some kind of
[1:03:35] religion but if you sit around with a
[1:03:37] neutral clod look you'd say no this is
[1:03:38] different
[1:03:39] never a man spake like this man the
[1:03:42] other men did like this man did
[1:03:45] hallelujah and that and if they want us
[1:03:48] with themselves I would say this is God
[1:03:50] this is the scripture made manifest this
[1:03:53] is light but because of the fear of the
[1:03:57] synagogue the fear of their religion the
[1:04:00] fear of their culture they stayed in
[1:04:02] darkness because they're worried about
[1:04:04] potholes it's into the path at least the
[1:04:07] life eternal
[1:04:08] there will be potholes on the road God's
[1:04:12] giving us a light that we can see them
[1:04:15] for what they are and we can just
[1:04:17] continue on if you walk in darkness and
[1:04:22] know that there's holes out there you'll
[1:04:24] be walking in fear and cautiously and
[1:04:27] your mind will be fixed on the danger
[1:04:30] and not the destination if you're in
[1:04:33] fear you'll be worried about the dangers
[1:04:36] out there amen
[1:04:39] you will not be you'll be fixed on the
[1:04:42] danger and not the destination and
[1:04:44] especially not the one who's mean to be
[1:04:46] leading you I mean if you're if you are
[1:04:49] fixed on the one who's lead if you're
[1:04:50] walking in light you will only see him
[1:04:53] right I don't worry about what the devil
[1:04:57] may do I'm not concerned it doesn't mean
[1:05:01] I just tend to blind eye and just ignore
[1:05:04] him we're not ignorant to the devil's
[1:05:05] devices we're not ignorant but yet I'm
[1:05:08] not worried about what he's doing I'm
[1:05:11] more concerned about what is my lord
[1:05:12] doing what is my Lord doing in my life
[1:05:15] what is he doing for me amen
[1:05:19] now brother brems he didn't turn on the
[1:05:24] light of 1964 sees people thinking
[1:05:26] they're walking in light the traditions
[1:05:29] of the father's the first thing you know
[1:05:30] they're walking in a glare of a light
[1:05:32] not the same light rejected the very
[1:05:34] light they claim to be worshiping his
[1:05:36] works thoroughly vindicated who he was
[1:05:38] Jesus hid himself search the Scriptures
[1:05:40] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:05:42] life and they are they that testify of
[1:05:44] me who can condemn me of sin he said who
[1:05:47] can prove that I've said anything or any
[1:05:49] claim I've made that the Heavenly Father
[1:05:51] has invented
[1:05:52] that threw me has proved to you that he
[1:05:55] was the light of the hour because of all
[1:05:57] the prophets that this Messiah should be
[1:06:01] this way and here it bloomed to life
[1:06:03] I like their phrase it bloomed to life
[1:06:05] it came to life I mean but their
[1:06:07] traditions had separated them from the
[1:06:09] real light of the word Pharisee said you
[1:06:11] cease Herodians whatever might be they
[1:06:13] got the world so gummed up like they did
[1:06:16] in all ages that they could not see the
[1:06:19] real light that put out their eyes they
[1:06:21] was used to walking in the glare Nix
[1:06:23] that'll be this tomorrow to me this will
[1:06:25] join this it'll be this will join that
[1:06:27] we find it's a false Morales Jesus is
[1:06:31] just as real today to a human heart as
[1:06:34] he ever was his power and his living
[1:06:37] presence is just as real today as it
[1:06:39] ever was
[1:06:41] hallelujah thou living by a glare of a
[1:06:43] false light now whatever you're living
[1:06:46] and will produce in your life right as I
[1:06:49] said now we shouldn't be if we're
[1:06:52] walking in darkness then it'll breed
[1:06:53] fear right if we walk in light there'd
[1:06:57] be perfect love now Jesus says in John
[1:07:04] chapter 12 verse 30 jesus answered see
[1:07:08] if this voice came not because of me but
[1:07:10] for your sakes now is the judgment of
[1:07:12] this world now shall the Prince of this
[1:07:14] world be cast out and I if I be lifted
[1:07:17] up from the earth will draw all men unto
[1:07:19] me this he said signifying what death he
[1:07:23] should die the people answered him we
[1:07:25] have heard out of the law
[1:07:27] that Christ abideth for ever and how
[1:07:29] saith thou the Son of Man must be lifted
[1:07:31] up who is the son of man he was the son
[1:07:33] of man in front of them then jesus said
[1:07:35] unto them yet a little while as the
[1:07:38] light with you walk while you have the
[1:07:40] light lest darkness come upon you for he
[1:07:42] that walketh in darkness knoweth not
[1:07:45] whither he goeth right while he have
[1:07:48] light believe in the light that ye may
[1:07:50] be children of the light these things
[1:07:53] spake Jesus and departed and did hide
[1:07:56] himself from them I mean if your
[1:07:58] children of light it means you've been
[1:07:59] birthed by the light now that light is
[1:08:01] produced in you hallelujah and that's
[1:08:05] that's the proof of the pudding now as
[1:08:06] the life that's produced out of a
[1:08:08] believer as light as the word made
[1:08:11] manifested and then
[1:08:13] amen we don't have the spirit of fear
[1:08:16] the believer does not have if you're
[1:08:18] walking in darkness you have fear right
[1:08:20] but if you walk in light you do not have
[1:08:22] fear amen Romans 8:14 says for as many
[1:08:26] as that led by the Spirit of God they
[1:08:29] are the sons of God hallelujah you see
[1:08:31] God's leadership in your life according
[1:08:33] to his word you know you're a child of
[1:08:35] God that's a good indication he leads
[1:08:37] you according to his word amen for we
[1:08:40] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:08:42] again to fear that word bondage means
[1:08:45] slavery we have not received the spirit
[1:08:47] of slavery into fear but ye have
[1:08:49] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:08:52] we cry Abba Father hollowly that spirit
[1:08:55] of adoption is the placing of a son or a
[1:08:57] child at the family Amen those who are
[1:09:00] walking in light they've received the
[1:09:02] spirit of adoption you know who your
[1:09:04] daddy is
[1:09:04] ever father's my father my father
[1:09:07] hallelujah the spirit itself beareth
[1:09:10] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:09:12] children of God and if children then is
[1:09:15] is of God and joint heirs with Christ if
[1:09:18] so be that we suffer with him we may be
[1:09:21] also glorified together amen if someone
[1:09:26] is fearful if someone has fear it will
[1:09:29] produce right and so but we haven't
[1:09:33] received a spirit of bondage again to
[1:09:37] fear we're not slaves I mean the
[1:09:39] believer is if you're walking in light
[1:09:41] you're not a slave right you're not you
[1:09:44] haven't received a spirit of slavery
[1:09:45] again to fear but you received a spirit
[1:09:48] of adoption hallelujah you know who you
[1:09:51] are your life says who you are I mean
[1:09:54] the life that's living out of you
[1:09:56] this message is an adoption message
[1:09:58] we'll come to it later I mean this
[1:10:00] message just to open your eyes that you
[1:10:02] would understand you're the children of
[1:10:03] God hallelujah we don't have the spirit
[1:10:08] of fear
[1:10:08] I'm no longer a slave to sin I'm not I'm
[1:10:12] not HR I'm not in fear what about what
[1:10:16] about what about I known who my
[1:10:18] believed and am persuaded here that he
[1:10:21] is able to keep that which I've
[1:10:22] committed to him against that day
[1:10:25] hallelujah now the Bible speaks of fear
[1:10:33] in different ways there is no such thing
[1:10:35] as godly fear having a real reverence
[1:10:38] right there is a godly fear there's also
[1:10:41] a fear as and being afraid but the thing
[1:10:43] is if we have been reconciled to God
[1:10:46] there is no fear anymore
[1:10:48] right if you've been reconciled to him
[1:10:51] right if you become a new creation and
[1:10:53] home amen
[1:10:55] you don't have fear because what can
[1:10:57] destroy you
[1:10:58] what can snuff your you know walk and
[1:11:01] ultimately they may burn this body you
[1:11:03] can do whatever you want with it but
[1:11:04] there's a soul in here and that soul is
[1:11:07] sealed into the kingdom hallelujah jesus
[1:11:11] said in Matthew 10 now this is the
[1:11:13] attributes of ones who walk in light we
[1:11:15] have nothing to be afraid of we have
[1:11:18] nothing to be afraid of come what may we
[1:11:20] know at whom we have belief hallelujah
[1:11:23] Matthew 10 and 28 and fear not them
[1:11:27] which kill the body but uh but are not
[1:11:30] able to kill the soul but rather fear
[1:11:32] him that is able to destroy both soul
[1:11:34] and body in hell are not two sparrows
[1:11:37] sold for a farthing and one of them
[1:11:39] shall not fall to the ground without
[1:11:40] your father
[1:11:41] but the very hairs of your head are all
[1:11:43] numbered I mean fear not
[1:11:46] therefore you are more valuable than
[1:11:48] many sparrows just don't fear those who
[1:11:51] can destroy the body so don't fear them
[1:11:54] be though fear him that can destroy both
[1:11:57] the soul in the body
[1:11:58] hallelujah but now if God has reconciled
[1:12:02] you you know the Bible says where once
[1:12:04] enemies of God amen
[1:12:07] where once his enemy but then there
[1:12:09] comes a point where we're no longer as
[1:12:11] enemy now if you have an enemy you fear
[1:12:15] your enemy right because you're actually
[1:12:17] working against them but then once
[1:12:19] you're reconciled this piece you don't
[1:12:21] need to figure enemy anymore
[1:12:22] right and we were his enemy he was never
[1:12:25] Arian to me we had to be reconciled in
[1:12:27] our mind right now brother brems says in
[1:12:29] the great and mighty Conqueror now this
[1:12:31] is
[1:12:31] walk in light great victories have been
[1:12:34] won many of us today can remember well
[1:12:36] the First World War this is this is
[1:12:38] priests of 1957 so many could have met
[1:12:40] date I remember when I was just a little
[1:12:42] boy I could hear the whistles blowing
[1:12:44] even the farmers of the fields stopped
[1:12:46] their horses waved their hats they
[1:12:47] scream they hollered what had happened
[1:12:49] the war was over victory was won the
[1:12:52] great economy that we were fighting for
[1:12:53] finally we had won the victory I'm
[1:12:56] thinking of this last World War I looked
[1:12:58] just across the street and when the
[1:13:00] whistles begin to blow people ran into
[1:13:01] the yards woman with their aprons on
[1:13:03] taking them off swinging them at the air
[1:13:05] bullets blew flew through the trees
[1:13:08] whistles blowed cars raced through the
[1:13:10] street people fell on their knees raised
[1:13:12] up their hands they scream they cried
[1:13:14] way because the war was over and the
[1:13:16] bless was the dear boys that was across
[1:13:18] the sea would soon be sailing home again
[1:13:21] to them what a victory what a time and
[1:13:23] what a thrill to any heart what a
[1:13:25] Jubilee that night everybody was in such
[1:13:27] a humor you could have walked into a
[1:13:30] restaurant eat walked out and not paid
[1:13:31] for it it would it would have been all
[1:13:33] right you could have asked for the next
[1:13:35] man's car it would have been alright we
[1:13:37] you could have asked what you wanted to
[1:13:39] and you would have probably got it
[1:13:40] because why the victory was won the boys
[1:13:43] were coming home it was all over and I'm
[1:13:45] thinking my brother it's it's too bad
[1:13:47] that those kind of feelings can't stay
[1:13:49] all the time but to the Christian this
[1:13:51] morning the victory is won the joy bells
[1:13:54] are ringing the war is over between God
[1:13:57] and man the victory has been won
[1:13:59] hallelujah so to the believer there's no
[1:14:02] war between God and man I mean God has
[1:14:04] reconciled man back to himself hello
[1:14:07] Luis we don't need to live in fear we
[1:14:09] don't need to walk in darkness when he's
[1:14:11] given us light another lujah i've been
[1:14:15] reconciled to god my sins have been all
[1:14:17] washed away I mean I'm not worried when
[1:14:21] I get over there is it all going to be
[1:14:22] okay it's been settled he settled my
[1:14:25] case for me hallelujah so I'm not
[1:14:28] walking in fear that's why the biggest
[1:14:30] problems people walk in darkness they
[1:14:32] think well have I done enough have I
[1:14:34] done enough have I prayed enough okay
[1:14:37] but yeah look at the religions of the
[1:14:39] world they're in darkness
[1:14:40] Catholicism you know they they they they
[1:14:43] pay money to get people out of purgatory
[1:14:45] they go on pilgrimages they rub you know
[1:14:48] walk up you know pray up steps and do
[1:14:51] all different kinds of things rub fit
[1:14:53] your kiss statues feet and do all kinds
[1:14:55] of things you say well isn't that
[1:14:59] ridiculous
[1:15:00] people are so-called Protestants do
[1:15:03] exactly the same thing with the Word of
[1:15:05] God they think of they've remembered
[1:15:06] enough studied enough tried to be good
[1:15:09] enough amen and they think well and they
[1:15:11] have no peace in the assault and they
[1:15:13] try and reconcile I've done this and
[1:15:16] I've done this and I've done this what
[1:15:18] has God done for you amen when do I meet
[1:15:22] him and it's all done because if you
[1:15:25] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:15:27] the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us
[1:15:29] from all sin so it's not what I've done
[1:15:32] it's what he did for me
[1:15:33] that's what matters amen
[1:15:38] it's easy to point a finger at the
[1:15:40] problem I mean at the Catholic what
[1:15:42] about everyone else they do that out of
[1:15:44] sincerity and other people they go to
[1:15:47] Bible school that are the kinds of
[1:15:48] things good works programs nothing wrong
[1:15:51] with good works but that's what they
[1:15:53] trying to be trying to find bargaining
[1:15:55] power with God because they're in
[1:15:57] darkness now the believer now has peace
[1:16:03] with God so what do we have to fear so
[1:16:05] you can Timothy why don't see open for
[1:16:07] God has not given us a spirit of fear
[1:16:08] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:16:11] mind right those who walk in light do
[1:16:14] not have the spirit of fear a member of
[1:16:17] power love and a sound mind those who
[1:16:19] are in fear looking for the exit they're
[1:16:22] looking for the first glimpse yet you
[1:16:25] know someone at you you watch or you
[1:16:27] seen in the bush like a deer go through
[1:16:29] the bush or some prey animal the first
[1:16:32] you know they're just going about their
[1:16:33] life but they're they're always they see
[1:16:36] well those who have seen in Africa you
[1:16:37] know the ears of the gazelles and things
[1:16:39] they're always turning there are
[1:16:41] security mode then living in fear
[1:16:44] because they know there's a predator out
[1:16:46] there they may see mummy eating or daddy
[1:16:49] I don't know but someone they knew bad
[1:16:52] things happen to them they're no longer
[1:16:54] with us because because they were they
[1:16:57] joined this kind of
[1:16:58] Church and this is what happened it's a
[1:17:00] scarecrow
[1:17:01] and they're living in fear you're not in
[1:17:04] confidence you ever seen a lion that's
[1:17:06] afraid they just you know they're you
[1:17:10] know they live a different kind of life
[1:17:11] to something that's prey they know
[1:17:12] they're not prey
[1:17:13] they know who they are in the jungle
[1:17:16] right do you know who you are in the
[1:17:19] jungle do you know we're not some
[1:17:21] gazelle that gets chewed up by the devil
[1:17:23] who walks around like a lion right
[1:17:26] devouring who you will if you're in
[1:17:28] darkness you will be that way you're
[1:17:30] always looking for and those who and
[1:17:32] feared always jumpy
[1:17:33] looking for the first sign of danger
[1:17:36] then they're gone they're always looking
[1:17:37] for the exit I'm not looking for an exit
[1:17:40] I found the one who's guiding me I found
[1:17:44] the ship of the ship and actually found
[1:17:45] me hallelujah where have the spirit of
[1:17:50] fear but of power and of love and a
[1:17:52] sound mind amen hey first John four so
[1:17:58] uh we're just going to read a lot I want
[1:18:01] these things you know just are you
[1:18:04] enlightened darkness
[1:18:06] and not just to be associated with
[1:18:08] people in life but to be really walking
[1:18:11] in the light first John four and sixteen
[1:18:13] and we have known and have believed that
[1:18:15] the love that no and the love that God
[1:18:18] hath to us god is love and he that
[1:18:20] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[1:18:22] in him he renews our love made perfect
[1:18:26] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:18:29] judgment because as he is so we are in
[1:18:32] this world there is no fear in love but
[1:18:35] perfect love casts out fear because fear
[1:18:38] hath torment he that feareth is not made
[1:18:42] perfect and love we love him because he
[1:18:45] first loved us right so he that has
[1:18:48] because fear hath torment he that loveth
[1:18:51] he that feareth is not made perfect than
[1:18:53] love right so if someone has fear
[1:18:57] they're walking in darkness they haven't
[1:18:59] made be made perfect in love fear hath
[1:19:03] torment right peace does not have for
[1:19:06] p-set love has peace amen
[1:19:10] we love him because he first loved us
[1:19:15] wherefore we receiving a kingdom that
[1:19:19] cannot be moved let us have grace
[1:19:20] whereby we may serve God except ibly oh
[1:19:24] this is Hebrews 12:28 forgive me whereby
[1:19:27] we receive me a kingdom which cannot be
[1:19:29] moved let us have grace whereby we may
[1:19:31] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[1:19:33] godly fear write godly fear as a it's a
[1:19:39] caution this is the definition
[1:19:41] it's a caution it's a religious
[1:19:44] reverence of piety right so it's not as
[1:19:48] in fear as your fear of you know we want
[1:19:52] to walk according to his word to please
[1:19:54] him yeah if you're walking in light
[1:19:57] you're more you're focused on the light
[1:20:00] and not what maybe outside the light
[1:20:04] okay walking in darkness has fear but
[1:20:08] not a godly fear those walking in light
[1:20:10] have fellowship with him we know he's
[1:20:12] going to turn it a bit those who are
[1:20:14] walking in light have fellowship with
[1:20:16] him he is their Shepherd he leads them
[1:20:18] by his word his voice right remember
[1:20:22] those who walk in darkness walk by a
[1:20:24] memory that's not walking according to
[1:20:28] us that's not walking according to a
[1:20:30] relationship
[1:20:31] those who walk in the light have a real
[1:20:33] relationship with God beyond a memory
[1:20:36] amen so now Sam's 23 verse 1 the Lord is
[1:20:41] my shepherd I shall not want he maketh
[1:20:43] me to lie down in green pastures he
[1:20:44] leadeth me beside the still waters he
[1:20:47] restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the
[1:20:49] paths of righteousness for his name's
[1:20:51] sake yea though I walk through the
[1:20:53] valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:20:55] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[1:20:57] rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:20:59] though I walk down through this world
[1:21:02] there may be potholes they may be snares
[1:21:04] there may be troubles I will not fear
[1:21:05] them I will not fear them because he is
[1:21:09] with me amen though I write on my staff
[1:21:12] they comfort me
[1:21:13] thou prepares a table before me in the
[1:21:15] presence of mine enemies thou anointest
[1:21:17] my head with oil my cup runneth over
[1:21:20] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:21:22] me all the days of my
[1:21:24] life I will dwell in the house of the
[1:21:26] Lord forever hallelujah that's how we
[1:21:29] should be
[1:21:30] you take Saul and David Saul after the
[1:21:35] Lord left him and an evil spirit came
[1:21:37] upon him he could only be king by memory
[1:21:41] right that evil spirit was on him he was
[1:21:43] paranoid who's going to take his kingdom
[1:21:45] he was living by fear and his whole
[1:21:47] kingdom was now established by fear and
[1:21:49] intimidation but now David was walking
[1:21:52] in the light here he was anointed he
[1:21:54] knew he's going to become king he knew
[1:21:56] that God would put him on the throne one
[1:21:57] day he wasn't walking in fear I mean he
[1:22:01] knew God would put him on the throne one
[1:22:03] day hallelujah two very different King

[1:22:08] trust you can you can identify with
[1:22:11] David Ayotte was Saul hey Saul was
[1:22:14] consumed who's going to take my kingdom
[1:22:16] while he is David now I'm going to
[1:22:17] destroy him you know tries to go find
[1:22:20] him a few times raises an army Joe he's
[1:22:23] all paranoid yeah we don't walk by
[1:22:26] paranoia amen Jesus says my sheep know
[1:22:31] my voice and a stranger they'll not
[1:22:32] follow
[1:22:33] Amen and I know them by name hallelujah

[1:22:53] so know either father I lay down my life
[1:22:55] for the Sheep and other sheep I have
[1:22:56] which are not of this fold him also I
[1:22:59] must bring and they shall hear my voice
[1:23:02] and they shall be of one fold and of one
[1:23:05] sheep so he's speaking now he's speaking
[1:23:08] of other ships he says they're sheep
[1:23:10] here but there's other sheep that I have
[1:23:12] right he's talking about you and I he's
[1:23:15] talking about through seven church ages
[1:23:17] there's sheep through seven church ages
[1:23:19] and they shall their my him also I must
[1:23:22] bring Amen so God was hunting them out
[1:23:26] he he hunted for you right he handed for
[1:23:30] you them also I must bring they shall
[1:23:32] hear my voice and there shall be one
[1:23:35] fold and one Shepherd
[1:23:36] so God has a voice speaking through
[1:23:38] seven Church ages amen and this and
[1:23:42] every church age lit every Church age
[1:23:45] finishes with the same phrase him that
[1:23:47] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:23:50] saith unto the churches
[1:23:52] so God is saying it's more than just
[1:23:54] having an ear he that really has a
[1:23:56] spiritual ear then let him hear what the
[1:23:59] Spirit is speaking to the church and we
[1:24:01] sit down through seven church ages God
[1:24:03] has still had light a mint and now so
[1:24:10] this is this is um so there has to be a
[1:24:14] voice in this day which will come - now
[1:24:17] John 8 John 8 and 37 says I know that
[1:24:23] you're Abraham's seed but you seek to
[1:24:25] kill me because my word hath no place in
[1:24:27] you I speak that which I've seen with my
[1:24:30] father and you do that which you've seen
[1:24:32] with your father jesus saith unto them
[1:24:35] of God were your father so I just joked
[1:24:38] jump down to verse 42 if god were your
[1:24:41] father you would love me for I proceeded
[1:24:44] forth and came from God neither came I
[1:24:47] of myself but he sent me why do you not
[1:24:49] understand my speech even because you
[1:24:51] cannot hear my word so they did not have
[1:24:54] an ear to hear what God was speaking in
[1:24:55] their generation samms 119:105 my word
[1:25:01] is a lamp unto my thigh word is a lamp
[1:25:03] unto my feet and a light unto my path
[1:25:06] hallelujah so his word we becomes
[1:25:09] manifested it's a light amen it's not by
[1:25:12] memory right
[1:25:14] Amos three and three can two walk
[1:25:16] together except they be agreed you have
[1:25:19] to agree with the light with us word in
[1:25:22] order to walk with it yes amen and that
[1:25:25] is more than just saying you know it's
[1:25:27] more than just out of tradition
[1:25:29] accepting his word you actually have to
[1:25:31] say this is it has to be reveal to you
[1:25:33] this is God's Word it says in first
[1:25:35] Corinthians 14 and 37 If any man think
[1:25:38] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[1:25:40] him acknowledge that the things that are
[1:25:42] right unto you are the commandments of
[1:25:44] the Lord that's pretty bold of Paul well
[1:25:46] he just said it if your spiritual or a
[1:25:48] prophet then you
[1:25:49] we'll acknowledge the things are right
[1:25:51] unto you they are the commandments of
[1:25:53] the Lord this is 1st Corinthians 14 37c
[1:25:56] saying this is not my idea this is not
[1:25:58] my opinion this is not just because we
[1:26:01] had some kind of meeting and this is the
[1:26:02] minutes of the meeting the things I
[1:26:04] write unto you they are God's work and
[1:26:06] if you're spiritual if you actually hear
[1:26:08] if you ever hear that here's what God is
[1:26:10] saying to the church you will receive my
[1:26:12] letters as God's Word I mean even as
[1:26:15] Peter says that brother Paul writes
[1:26:17] letters the words that are hard to
[1:26:19] understand as those who are unstable
[1:26:21] they wrestle with it as they do the rest
[1:26:24] of the scriptures
[1:26:25] right so Peter already had the
[1:26:27] revelation what Paul was writing in his
[1:26:29] day was equal with the Old Testament
[1:26:31] scripture amen and those people who
[1:26:34] walked in the light received Paul's
[1:26:36] ministry they received his writings and
[1:26:38] they recognized this was God's voice to
[1:26:41] us amen and that's but as I said if
[1:26:45] how can two walk together and they say
[1:26:48] and be agreed if those are not even of
[1:26:51] all people do it today as well they take
[1:26:53] the writings of Paul and they say well
[1:26:55] that's just his idea it doesn't apply to
[1:26:57] us as a different culture it doesn't
[1:26:58] apply in this day they're not agreeing
[1:27:00] with it so how can they walk with God's
[1:27:03] Word if they're saying no this is man's
[1:27:04] idea right so they're not walking in
[1:27:07] light anymore now they've gone into
[1:27:08] darkness they meant does he have to
[1:27:15] receive it and Paul didn't make any
[1:27:19] apologies for it he said he said if if
[1:27:22] you're really spiritual you you will
[1:27:24] receive what I write as God's Word if
[1:27:27] you're spiritual
[1:27:29] this is the judgment of your
[1:27:30] spirituality if you say this is if what
[1:27:32] I writing you know imagine if we got
[1:27:34] something in this day and a man said
[1:27:37] that you think that's way off
[1:27:40] that's what Paul did in his day and the
[1:27:43] people the people had the Spirit of God
[1:27:45] had an ear to hear what the Spirit said
[1:27:47] they said this is God God has written us
[1:27:50] a letter there's not as I D he's not
[1:27:52] leaning a certain way because of how he
[1:27:54] was built or his background or as as his
[1:27:57] culture this is God speaking to us
[1:28:00] hallelujah
[1:28:02] amen why are you saying that we have a
[1:28:08] lot of scripture that is being fulfilled
[1:28:11] in this day an hour right it says in
[1:28:15] Malachi 4 let's just let's just read a
[1:28:18] bit because then we're gonna then we're
[1:28:21] gonna drive it home
[1:28:25] this is Malachi 4 and 5 behold I send
[1:28:36] you Elijah the Prophet before the coming
[1:28:38] of the Great and dreadful day of the
[1:28:40] Lord and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:28:41] father's to the children and the heart
[1:28:43] of the children to their fathers least I
[1:28:45] come and smite the earth with a curse
[1:28:48] right there's a prophecy this prophecy
[1:28:52] has been fulfilled amen we go to Luke 1
[1:28:56] and 17 we're just going to read three
[1:28:58] scriptures Luke 1 and 17 this is being
[1:29:13] of John the John the Baptist ministry
[1:29:16] notices his he shall turn the hearts of
[1:29:18] the father's to the children and then
[1:29:20] there's a comma and the heart of the
[1:29:22] children to the father's to speak about
[1:29:23] two different ministries Luke 1 and 17
[1:29:26] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[1:29:27] and power of Elias to turn the hearts of
[1:29:29] the father's to the children and to the
[1:29:31] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[1:29:33] make ready a people prepared for the
[1:29:35] Lord Amen it's is turning the hearts of
[1:29:38] the father's to the children not the
[1:29:39] hearts of the children to the father's
[1:29:40] John never turned the people back to
[1:29:44] Moses law he never turned it back to the
[1:29:47] faith of the fathers he turned the
[1:29:48] hearts of the fathers of the children to
[1:29:50] a new faith that was coming which was
[1:29:52] the furtherance of Moses law right so he
[1:29:54] never he never he never established a
[1:29:57] true worship according to Moses law Amen
[1:30:01] he didn't do that he he preached the
[1:30:03] kingdom of God is coming he pointed out
[1:30:05] the Messiah that was and his preaching
[1:30:07] turn the hearts of the people from the
[1:30:10] law of the traditions to receive the
[1:30:11] Messiah right that was his ministry amen
[1:30:15] he didn't and then also John did not
[1:30:20] come before the great and dreadful day
[1:30:23] of the Lord which is the Great
[1:30:24] Tribulation because it's been two
[1:30:26] thousand years and there hasn't been a
[1:30:28] Great Tribulation yet
[1:30:29] right but he came with the spirit of
[1:30:31] Elijah it's what you saw Elijah do and
[1:30:34] Elijah do John was the same kind of
[1:30:36] Prophet wilderness preach against
[1:30:38] ungodly woman and churches and different
[1:30:40] things pointed the people back to the
[1:30:42] truth yes same characteristics as the
[1:30:45] same spirit was upon them yes amen let's
[1:30:48] go to Matthew let's go to Matthew 17 I'm
[1:30:56] just establishing that it's like we say
[1:30:59] well why are you reading these things I
[1:31:00] just want to establish that now if God
[1:31:02] has said he'd send a prophet to restore
[1:31:04] in this day then that is light for this
[1:31:06] day right and those who really received
[1:31:10] that ministry will walk and the light as
[1:31:12] he is in the light Matthew 17 and we'll
[1:31:16] go to verse 10 and his disciples asked
[1:31:19] him saying why then shall the scribes I
[1:31:22] mean sorry why didn't say the scribes
[1:31:23] that Elias must first come and jesus
[1:31:26] answered and said unto them Elias truly
[1:31:28] shall first come and restore all things
[1:31:29] so he shall come in the future but I say
[1:31:32] to you that Elias has come already and
[1:31:34] they knew him not but they have done
[1:31:36] unto him whatsoever they listed likewise
[1:31:38] shall also the Son of man suffer of them
[1:31:41] then the disciples understood that he
[1:31:43] spake unto them of John the Baptist
[1:31:45] see notice Jesus said he shall come and
[1:31:47] restore all things yea John didn't
[1:31:50] restore right he didn't we can go -
[1:31:54] maybe we'll go to x1 in Acts chapter 3
[1:31:57] the disciples are still looking there
[1:31:59] asking Jesus when are you gonna restore
[1:32:01] the kingdom
[1:32:02] you know John didn't restore right if he
[1:32:06] restored all things the kingdom would
[1:32:07] have been restored in the days of
[1:32:09] ministry Jesus speaking of another
[1:32:10] coming of Elijah is in this day right
[1:32:15] let's go to x1
[1:32:28] and verse 6 there's after the
[1:32:30] resurrection when when they therefore
[1:32:35] will come together they asked of him
[1:32:36] saying Lord will thou at this time
[1:32:39] restore again the Kingdom of Israel and
[1:32:42] he said unto them it is not for you to
[1:32:44] know the times or the seasons which the
[1:32:45] father has put in his own power but you
[1:32:48] shall receive the but you shall receive
[1:32:50] power after that the Holy Ghost is come
[1:32:52] upon you and you shall be witnesses unto
[1:32:54] me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea
[1:32:57] and in Samaria and unto the uttermost
[1:32:59] parts of the earth
[1:33:00] they're asking when are you gonna
[1:33:01] restore the kingdom it's not for you to
[1:33:03] know it's a feature e-vite right so John
[1:33:07] didn't restore all things Jesus speaking
[1:33:09] of two comings of Elijah I'm sure I'm
[1:33:11] sure that's quite clear right and then
[1:33:15] now let's go to x3 because we're still
[1:33:20] in the book of Acts and we're gonna go
[1:33:21] to verse 19 he says repent ye therefore
[1:33:27] and be converted that your sins may be
[1:33:29] blotted out when the times of refreshing
[1:33:32] shall come from the presence of the Lord
[1:33:34] and ye and he shall see in Jesus Christ
[1:33:37] which before was preached unto you whom
[1:33:39] the heaven must receive until the times
[1:33:42] the times of restitution of all things
[1:33:45] which God has spoken by the mouth of all
[1:33:48] his holy prophets since the world began
[1:33:50] so Peter is speaking of a future times
[1:33:54] of restitution of which restitution the
[1:33:57] same as restoration it's been a feature
[1:33:59] time of the times of restoration of all
[1:34:01] things now we are living in that time I
[1:34:04] mean we're living in that time where God
[1:34:07] if you go through church history it's
[1:34:09] very clear that the that the church went
[1:34:12] into the dark ages right truth was
[1:34:15] virtually blotted out but God said I
[1:34:17] will restore so now light began to shine
[1:34:19] and then God sent Luther with the just
[1:34:22] shall live by faith right he brought a
[1:34:24] lot of Catholicism with him but that was
[1:34:26] the part God began to restore that was
[1:34:28] light those that received that light now
[1:34:30] they're the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:34:32] pleased them from all sin because they
[1:34:34] now walk in life don't you stayed with
[1:34:36] the Catholic Church were in darkness and
[1:34:38] then there was a Reformation all right
[1:34:40] God begins to restore interest or you
[1:34:42] say well does that mean you have to know
[1:34:44] what all the lighters no you just go to
[1:34:45] receive it and walk in it like like
[1:34:47] brother Isaac said on Wednesday in there
[1:34:49] I believe was a masterpiece he said it's
[1:34:50] like to say same thing between a general
[1:34:52] who served in the Army 40 odd years and
[1:34:55] and a new recruit that's been there for
[1:34:57] a week
[1:34:58] you know if they died that same moment
[1:34:59] they serve the army just as well because
[1:35:02] that's all they knew they lived
[1:35:04] according to what was revealed to them
[1:35:05] right and so now Luther came out just
[1:35:09] shall live by faith then and then life
[1:35:11] begin to get bigger
[1:35:13] Wesley came young with with
[1:35:15] sanctification living a holy life that
[1:35:17] was a furtherance of the light right and
[1:35:20] now there was a challenge will the
[1:35:21] people just stay you know with with what
[1:35:24] became a denomination or would they walk
[1:35:27] further and go without walk and more of
[1:35:29] the word I meant where would you be and
[1:35:32] people receive the light it was within
[1:35:34] their gifts were restored but then there
[1:35:36] had to be at time at a full time of
[1:35:39] restoration where are people who who
[1:35:42] were a people would be restored to the
[1:35:44] full power of the book of Acts Church
[1:35:46] again I mean that they would be restored
[1:35:48] to a church with full power amen in
[1:35:51] presence of God as they had in the
[1:35:53] beginning because he was a great falling
[1:35:54] away but they had to be a restoration so
[1:35:57] people would now would be taken from
[1:35:59] from living under creeds and dogmas
[1:36:02] right but then they would return to
[1:36:04] walking with the truth of God's Word
[1:36:07] Alleluia so now God said in this day an
[1:36:10] hour that the Son of Man would be
[1:36:12] revealed as it was the days of lot Sodom
[1:36:15] and Gomorrah wasn't days of Noah go read
[1:36:17] about what happened two days of Noah so
[1:36:19] shall be when the Son of Man is revealed
[1:36:20] we're living in that day so now God is
[1:36:23] saying when you see these conditions in
[1:36:25] the earth lights gonna come immediately
[1:36:28] announced the revealing of the Son of
[1:36:30] Man so the same ministry that Jesus had
[1:36:32] would repeat again but now in a prophet
[1:36:35] I mean there will be a ministry at the
[1:36:37] end time of of a of a restoration
[1:36:40] prophet amen that we read about in
[1:36:42] Malachi that the hearts of the children
[1:36:44] returned to the faith back to the faith
[1:36:47] of the fathers again I mean and in that
[1:36:50] ministry now is the revealing of the son
[1:36:52] of man
[1:36:53] as Christ would be revealed hallelujah
[1:36:55] and that was done that the people would
[1:36:57] know that what that messenger was
[1:36:59] preaching was according to the scripture
[1:37:01] not according to man and that's why I
[1:37:03] said about the Apostle Paul if those who
[1:37:05] took it said well he's a he's a Jew anis
[1:37:07] you know he's been a Pharisee and this
[1:37:09] is why he's preaching this way and this
[1:37:10] is why he writes very kind of legal and
[1:37:13] strict and you got to know how to
[1:37:15] possess your visa with honor and all
[1:37:17] these different kind of things you know
[1:37:18] why is it so complicated well it's
[1:37:20] because he was a Pharisee and they have
[1:37:22] a lot of old tradition no it wasn't
[1:37:24] because of that you know it was because
[1:37:27] God was speaking through right it was
[1:37:29] the commandments of God so Paul when he
[1:37:31] was writing it wasn't because of his
[1:37:33] personality he was writing a certain way
[1:37:35] or you know or his upbringing it was God
[1:37:38] and it was perfectly balanced right and
[1:37:41] it's the same thing today God has seen
[1:37:43] Elijah to the earth right
[1:37:46] he wasn't leaning a certain way because
[1:37:47] of his personality I mean he wasn't
[1:37:49] preaching a certain way cuz it was
[1:37:51] upbringing it was God speaking
[1:37:53] I meant that a balance came into the
[1:37:56] church that people could actually walk
[1:37:57] according to the scripture and not
[1:37:59] according to personality of man amen and
[1:38:02] then so he's there in front of thousands
[1:38:05] of people and you can hear it on tape I
[1:38:06] trust you hear those tapes amen
[1:38:09] where God would now say you know when he
[1:38:11] said now I'm waiting for him to come
[1:38:13] then the angel of God comes down into
[1:38:16] the meeting as I said before everyone
[1:38:17] knew he was there
[1:38:18] amen him being able to call people out
[1:38:20] and and reveal things down to details
[1:38:24] but that was all done that your people
[1:38:27] would recognize this is God's doing and
[1:38:30] it wasn't done in a corner it wasn't a
[1:38:32] private thing it was a public thing
[1:38:35] hallelujah and didn't know this was done
[1:38:40] because it says in Revelations 10 and 7
[1:38:43] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:38:44] angel when he should begin to sound all
[1:38:46] the mystery of God should be finished as
[1:38:48] he declared to his servants the prophets
[1:38:50] right and heavenly beings heavenly
[1:38:54] angels do not preach the gospel man
[1:38:56] always preaches the gospel that's a
[1:38:58] earthly messenger that severed angel
[1:39:01] amen
[1:39:02] so he said in the days of his voice the
[1:39:04] mystery of God should be finished
[1:39:06] hallelujah and so now we are we are
[1:39:10] living in that day we are living in that
[1:39:13] day they say well what does that got to
[1:39:15] do with life because it's the reason we
[1:39:17] read those scriptures and we'd go
[1:39:19] through many more as to show you that
[1:39:21] God has interpreted as word by bringing
[1:39:24] it to pass right there's no longer
[1:39:26] prophecy but it's been manifested it's
[1:39:28] been manifested in our generation and so
[1:39:31] now if you receive it your walk and
[1:39:33] light amen
[1:39:35] if you receive your walk in light but
[1:39:39] then to reject it is to walk in darkness
[1:39:42] because all because what it is it just
[1:39:45] reveals Jesus Christ in the scripture I
[1:39:47] mean that we can have a true
[1:39:49] relationship with Jesus Christ according
[1:39:51] to his Scripture right not according to
[1:39:53] man's theology but according to a
[1:39:55] scripture amen so if we walk in the
[1:40:00] light as he is in the light we have
[1:40:05] fellowship one with another and the
[1:40:07] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses
[1:40:10] us from all sin amen you say well that's
[1:40:13] awfully kind of rigid that's God's
[1:40:18] program we had to if we were living if
[1:40:22] we were living in the days of John the
[1:40:23] Baptist and we lived up into the up into
[1:40:27] yo the book of Acts you had to receive
[1:40:30] John to receive Jesus right if you're
[1:40:33] addicted John you would have rejected
[1:40:35] Jesus you would have right and then now
[1:40:39] you receive Jesus and then now here come
[1:40:41] the apostles you had to actually receive
[1:40:44] what they were preaching you say well
[1:40:46] they just make it more complicated I
[1:40:47] just want to follow Jesus of Nazareth
[1:40:49] and I just want to sit at us feed all
[1:40:51] these things in order to do that you had
[1:40:53] to receive their preaching you had to
[1:40:55] receive their epistles right because
[1:40:57] that was the same ministry just
[1:40:59] continuing on yes you know we can we can
[1:41:02] let's go to X 18 this is a perfect
[1:41:05] example let's go to the end of X 18
[1:41:21] now we're about to read about a man
[1:41:24] who's a converted lawyer
[1:41:25] his name's Apollo's it's read from verse
[1:41:30] 24 of acts 18 and a certain Jew named
[1:41:33] Apollo's born at Alexandria an eloquent
[1:41:37] man and mighty in the scriptures came to
[1:41:39] Ephesus
[1:41:39] this man was instructed in the way the
[1:41:42] Lord and being fervent in the spirit he
[1:41:44] spake and taught diligently the things
[1:41:46] of the Lord knowing only the baptism of
[1:41:48] John and he began to speak boldly in the
[1:41:51] synagogue and when Aquila and Priscilla
[1:41:53] had heard they took him under them
[1:41:56] expounded unto Him the way of God more
[1:41:58] perfectly and when he was disposed to
[1:42:01] pass into acacia and brethren wrote
[1:42:04] exhorting the disciples to receive him
[1:42:06] who when he was come help their much
[1:42:09] which had believed through grace for he
[1:42:11] mightily convinced the Jews and their
[1:42:13] publicly showing by the scriptures that
[1:42:16] Jesus was Christ so he's a man who
[1:42:19] believes that Jesus was the Messiah but
[1:42:22] he only knows the baptism of John but
[1:42:24] he's forever and in the spirit this
[1:42:25] man's a real believer he sincere at what
[1:42:27] he's doing but he only knows the baptism
[1:42:29] of John God's moved on God's we've gone
[1:42:32] John John John has come God died the
[1:42:35] Messiah's come this man believes in the
[1:42:38] Messiah but he hasn't received and then
[1:42:41] but then he hasn't been baptized right
[1:42:43] John's baptism doesn't work anymore
[1:42:45] this minute so so now now he's a
[1:42:48] challenge he's a man he's very devout
[1:42:51] right fervent Heat he's fervent in
[1:42:55] spirit he preached he showed them from
[1:42:58] the scripture that Jesus was the Messiah
[1:42:59] he's a fundamental believer fervent and
[1:43:02] spirit but now let's see but the lights
[1:43:05] moved on season in Ex 19 and 1 and when
[1:43:09] it came to pass that while Apollo's was
[1:43:11] at Corinth Paul being passed through the
[1:43:13] upper coast came to Ephesus finding
[1:43:15] certain disciples he said unto them have
[1:43:18] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:43:21] believed and they said unto Him we have
[1:43:23] not so much as heard as whether there be
[1:43:24] any Holy Ghost and they said unto them
[1:43:26] under what then were you baptized and
[1:43:29] they said unto John's baptism then said
[1:43:33] Paul and John then
[1:43:34] said Paul John Bailey baptized with the
[1:43:36] baptism of repentance saying unto the
[1:43:38] people that they should believe on him
[1:43:40] which should come after him that is on
[1:43:43] christ jesus and when they heard this
[1:43:45] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:43:47] Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his
[1:43:50] hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on
[1:43:52] them and they spake with tongues and
[1:43:54] prophesied and all men were about twelve
[1:43:58] so now these people are they going to
[1:44:02] receive are they gonna say no I'm
[1:44:04] already a believer I've received Jesus's
[1:44:06] death you know I was baptized by the way
[1:44:09] to introduce the man I think that's good
[1:44:11] enough for me
[1:44:12] look look at my Christian life no they
[1:44:14] had to go beyond that they had to
[1:44:16] receive the truth of Scripture they had
[1:44:18] to walk in the light they had to walk in
[1:44:21] the light as he is in the life right and
[1:44:23] then when they did then the Holy Ghost
[1:44:25] came upon them and they manifested what
[1:44:28] what the believers did on the day of
[1:44:30] Pentecost because they begin to walk in
[1:44:33] the light right but if they said no we
[1:44:35] don't need this we're we're good enough
[1:44:37] now our faith is good enough his blood
[1:44:39] is good enough you know we don't need to
[1:44:42] receive what you're saying do they would
[1:44:44] have gone into darkness but it's easy to
[1:44:48] it's easy to say that well that was in
[1:44:51] history or what about today I mean
[1:44:55] that's why if you look at people who
[1:44:58] really believe the Ministry of brother
[1:45:00] Branham they don't fall in love with the
[1:45:02] messenger they fall in love with Jesus
[1:45:04] Christ the message
[1:45:05] hey man they love they have relationship
[1:45:08] with the shepherd they're never
[1:45:10] relationship with the one who introduced
[1:45:11] the shepherd that relationship with the
[1:45:12] shepherd is very different I mean where
[1:45:14] are people who really what was this
[1:45:16] ministry as john the baptist was sent to
[1:45:19] forerun the first coming of christ he
[1:45:21] was told by the angel lord your message
[1:45:22] will forerun the second coming right and
[1:45:25] his message has fallen a second coming
[1:45:27] where people have become one with Jesus
[1:45:29] Christ hallelujah
[1:45:31] and now you look at their lives you say
[1:45:33] well you in darkness or in light well I
[1:45:35] can walk around and I'm not worried
[1:45:37] about potholes I can see this I'm not
[1:45:40] going to trip over it because I'm in
[1:45:41] light I got to turn the lights off and
[1:45:44] then I apply my trip over this thing
[1:45:46] someone moved it somewhere right you
[1:45:49] gotta look at now what is your life
[1:45:51] producing a walking in darkness and and
[1:45:54] fear well there's this pot all this
[1:45:56] person did this I've heard this this is
[1:45:57] on the Internet
[1:45:58] oh I'm not worried about those things
[1:46:00] because I see what it produces I mean I
[1:46:04] see what it makes hallelujah you become
[1:46:07] a real part a graphic you say this thing
[1:46:09] works and now if his blood cleanses us
[1:46:13] from all sin now water sin sinners
[1:46:15] unbelief right and unbelief is
[1:46:17] manifested in many different ways
[1:46:20] amen so if someone is still in darkness
[1:46:22] there's still sin manifesting their life
[1:46:24] they're still smoking drinking killing
[1:46:27] adultery whatever more living like the
[1:46:29] world you say well all that's you know
[1:46:32] John said if you love the world other
[1:46:34] things the world lover girls not even in
[1:46:35] you and your life will show what you
[1:46:38] love you know what's really in you so if
[1:46:42] we're really cleans from all sin then
[1:46:44] what do we love amen
[1:46:47] we're now caught up with this world this
[1:46:49] you know we were in Brisbane amazing
[1:46:52] city billions of dollars literally just
[1:46:55] there and I was thinking you know I
[1:46:57] admired the place but I think well
[1:46:59] probably one day this will just be all
[1:47:00] smoke bombs and craters and ashes
[1:47:02] there'll come a time when there's a new
[1:47:04] heavens and new earth it won't even be
[1:47:06] remembered and the same thing with this
[1:47:07] building same thing with this place that
[1:47:10] we we we love this country right you
[1:47:14] know it's a nice place when it's sunny
[1:47:16] even sometimes when it's raining you
[1:47:19] know it won't be even a memory anymore
[1:47:23] amen but the thing is now if you really
[1:47:26] love the Lord your treasure where your
[1:47:28] treasures where your heart is that's
[1:47:30] where your treasure will be also so if
[1:47:33] your heart is upon worldly things or
[1:47:35] even just natural man's religion this is
[1:47:37] where you as where you have is right but
[1:47:39] if your heart is on him I mean if you
[1:47:42] fall in love with your ship of the Lord
[1:47:44] Jesus Christ that's what your treasures
[1:47:45] are in heaven amen
[1:47:49] this message is light it is scriptural
[1:47:53] light right it has me personally it
[1:47:57] quick and me
[1:47:59] that made me alive I've shared a bit
[1:48:02] about what I used to be I'm not that
[1:48:03] person anymore and I don't have to get
[1:48:05] up in the morning say lord help me not
[1:48:07] to take another drink in my life help me
[1:48:09] to stay away from the bottle store help
[1:48:10] me to stay away from computer games and
[1:48:12] music and movies and help me ya know
[1:48:15] that that old person died amen and he
[1:48:19] said do not do not resuscitate on that
[1:48:21] person he's dead
[1:48:24] why because light when light comes it
[1:48:27] brings life now we're coming into
[1:48:30] springtime well hopefully you know
[1:48:33] everything's gonna start blossoming
[1:48:34] again life is going to come right
[1:48:37] because the our part of the earth is
[1:48:38] coming closer to the Sun and now this
[1:48:40] longer longer days there's more sunlight
[1:48:42] the temperature increases right now life
[1:48:45] comes forth because it's now unlike
[1:48:48] hallelujah and that's what this message
[1:48:51] does because the scripture light a
[1:48:52] bridge life I think we have the
[1:48:55] musicians I mean so don't be children of
[1:49:03] darkness walking light least and they
[1:49:15] sing that song keep me a little blessed
[1:49:18] Lord and leave me Lord in the way thou
[1:49:21] has gone leading straight to land above
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:39] my way every day with love let me Lord
