little group now may your anointing presence be upon us we ask in jesus' name amen amen thank you amen thank you musicians amen praise the Lord amen it's good to see each and everyone here amen if you've got your Bibles handy we just turn straight to the scripture thank you brother John amen God bless you and it's got a Song of Solomon Chapter 2 amen you know it's uh I just can't seem to escape this chapter so I don't know how much longer we'll be in here but here we are again so um so we'll just read verse verses 8 down to verse 14 and then we're going to go to the Book of Micah chapter 7 says here the voice of my beloved behold he come cometh leaping upon the mountain skipping upon the hills my beloved is like a row or a young heart behold he standeth behind our wall he lookth forth at the ladders uh sorry at forth at the windows showing himself through the lattice my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for though the winter is passed the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of the birds has come and the voice of the turtle which is the turtle love has heard in our land the Fig Tree put forth her green figs and the vines with tender grape give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away oh my Dove Thou Art In The Cliffs of The Rock and the secret place of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely let's go to the Book of Micah chapter 7 and we'll just read a couple of verses there verses uh 7 and 8 [Music] now notice we read in in song of um song of solom he says Rise up my love my fear one and come away he says here just as a bit of a context therefore I will look unto the Lord I'll wait for the god of my salvation my God will hear me Rejoice not against me oh my enemy me when I fall I shall arise when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me amen let's just let's just pray again father Lord we've gathered Lord to not just see one another but to see you in your word father we know your word is not a newspaper or a textbook it takes your Divine Spirit to reveal it to us Lord and father we pray for the spirit of Revelation Lord that you would come illuminate us Lord that we may see yes Lord father may you anoint speaker and hearer now may you have Liberty Among Us and father may you be glorified in everything said and done Lord we just thank you and we love you in Jesus Christ's name amen am amen amen you may have your seats so I want to I want to continue on uh on our bit of a series here from Song of Solomon Chapter 2 but I want to take a I want to take the uh just just from there mic and also how he says in verse 10 how my beloved spake he said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away and then in Mich care he said Rejoice not against me oh my enemy when I fall I shall arise when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me I'm sure we can agree that this age is the darkest age there ever has been amen amen we we truly have been born into a very dark age but it doesn't necessarily matter how dark the world is we just need to look at the light amen because whenever the enemy does something God always raises a standard that is greater than what the enemy can ever do that's right now this word Darkness it it figuratively means a misery a destruction death an ignorance a sorrow or a wickedness and so many times we we we are dwelling in that kind of State in a in a state of darkness and I could just say right from the offset we were born in this state we were born in a dark state but God God's will is that we would not stay in that state amen amen now the Bible I just want to lay a few comments down the Bible is the unfolding or revealing of God's Great Plan of Redemption now it starts out in the in the garden before the fall it starts out with a man and a woman who are actually two parts of one they're actually you know Eve only received her name after the fall she was still called man you know she was called woman because she came out of man but actually they were the the two of them we would look at them say they're two separate entities but they were one just in two bodies so it starts out with a man and a woman who are two parts to make a hole in a paradise called The Garden of Eden and they had dominion over the Earth God told them subdue it expand the garden you know you have dominion but then there was also the enemy and his instrument the serpent there and then we jump to the end of the Bible and there is a man which is Christ Jesus and there is a woman the bride of Christ and the two parts make the whole now there's also the foolish virgin the 144,000 and all those people as well but I want to major just on the on the on the bride and the bridegroom and there's also Paradise restored and there's a New Jerusalem that's at the end of the book but there is one one character that was at the beginning that's not at the end amen amen the enemy the enemy is not there I mean when you come to the end in the Book of Revelation the serpent is not there the devil's not there the Beast whatever he he tries to manifest himself and the enemy is not there amen he's not there anymore because your enemy is done away with and destroyed in the Lake of Fire your enemy has done away with now I'm sure you can we can all agree this is God's doing I mean this is definitely not the enemy's doing or even you're doing this it's God's doing and the devil for one cannot stop this happening amen hallelujah he reads the same word you read he listens to the same message you've received and he fights it and he sees how he can try and get around it but there's nothing can stop God's purpose amen there is nothing that will stop God putting his enemy into a lake of fire and then when that happens the Bible says all the saints said hallelujah amen and they rejoiced Hallelujah so man now so in the beginning man was God over the Earth but man fell from his position amen because Adam he he adjudicated the throne or left the throne in order to try and save his wife Eve and the scripture tells us in in 1 Timothy 2:14 that Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression So Adam knew what he was doing am mean Adam knew what he was doing but he knew that he couldn't lose part of himself Hallelujah that's why he willingly forfeited godship over the Earth Amen to save part of himself hey you know save save Eve and then what happened is the devil we we we know the devil filled that void and took man's place and that's why we have suffering that's why we have death that's why we have all this Darkness over the Earth is because man has fallen from his position and Satan is now the God of this world that's right it says in Ephesians 2 and two wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience amen so he is the prince of the power of the a he controls nature and that's why we have the destruction and all the famines and all these terrible things because the devil does it now I'm talking about so so my subject today is from there from Micah I will arise there's a people in this day that are rising to her position am mean there's a people that are there's a bride being lifted up in this end time that's why he says in Song of Solomon Arise My Fear One my love and come away so there has to be a rising I mean there has to be a people coming back to where she should have been in the beginning and we are living in that time we're living in a time where the bride is lifted up into her position in Christ and we're living in the time of the casting down of Satan hallelujah we're living in that time where Satan is cast down and the bride is lifted up amen hallelujah now I just want to tell you that cuz that's where I'm going if you why am I reading this is where I'm going amen so he is the prince of the power of the year amen and then even we we know when Jesus when he was tempted by Satan there you know Satan showed him all the kingdoms of the earth and he said I'll give this all to you he's saying them I'm I'm in control I'll give these all to you if you just Bow Down and Worship me and Jesus never said no you're not in control of them he actually acknowledged yeah you are in control he was he is God over the Earth but then Jesus said get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou serve now brother brah says in the future home he says here how can I be in the porn shop and out of the porn shop at the same time see he redeemed Us by his blood by his Spirit he cleansed us and then he comes to dwell in us the church not the denomination now the church notice close now as we take this the place we are to dwell in he says now now he's speaking of the Redemption of the earth now the andalu and repentance that brought forth water baptism then Christ came and shed his blood upon it to cleanse it and to claim it and then comes the next the destruction of the world as it is now all the sin that's in the heavens above he's the prince of the power of the earth speaking of Satan he keeps off Wards off the blessings from God and there comes Thunderbolts of lightnings and Strikes the Earth and everything from Heaven cheats of ice and rain and typhoon storms and everything comes from above which is Satan the prince of the power of the air that's why when the Lord Burns this place off with a Holy Fire he's got to he's got to burn off the ATM your atmospheres as well cuz that's where all the devils are that's where Satan operates from that realm amen but we understand that when the because we you know we understand that if there's to be a restoration of Eden and there's to be a restoration of the man and the woman then God has to through the scripture now show the redeemed man and then show the redeemed woman and brother BR speaks of the Masterpiece how Jesus Jesus was reflected down through the Old Testament and then finally the Masterpiece God what God had in his mind is the perfect man was standing in flesh and this and this the Apostle Paul says he is the second Adam so he began to demonstrate everything the first Adam did and then there came a time where where there was a there was a struggle now over nature and now the the Victor was going to prove who nature really belonged to and he was here was the creator in flesh and he was asleep on the boat you know when they cross ing the Sea of Galilee and the and the devil swore that that finally he had the chance I'm going to drown him and brother BR said 10,000 Devils God into the water and whipped it up and caused the storm and because the devil thought I'm in control of nature I can do it I have the power but then but then they woke Jesus and the son of man stood up and just with a few words said peace be still and the creation recognize its creator Hallelujah that those Devils had to had to let go of what they trying to do because nature had to obey him because he made nature Hallelujah and that's what he was proving there who does nature really belong to and he's saying it belongs to me because it obeys my voice amen hallelujah amen and so now Jesus operated out of a realm of perfect Faith he knew who he was amen he knew he knew what the scripture said that he would do and he could out he could operate out of a realm of perfect Faith cuz he had confidence in who he was and the prophet tells him perfect faith if he can live that way you can sure live that way amen amen if you recognize what God has made you amen it doesn't matter if you're feeling happy sad or glad or whatever about it what has God Made You what does this message say you are Hallelujah you know the prophet says he says the devil cast a vote against me God for me it all depends where you cast your vote amen did you do you take what the devil says about you or do you take What God Says About You amen hallelujah I'd sure take What God Says About Me amen whatever you do take what he says and then so Jesus had power over nature he had power over sickness over death over everything cuz he was demonstrating what the first Adam lost was being manifested in the second Adam amen so a man a man in the first time came back to its rightful position but that was only the restoration of the man there has to be a restoration of the woman and brother Bram tells us in the masterpiece he says this he so there's an identified Masterpiece of God in yor he says you remember when they read in the day um uh that day in the book he just he read just part of the prophecy speak you know you know in Luke 4 how he takes Isaiah this day the scriptures fulfilled left the rest of it for the last days we are supposed to take that part you see he wants to cut the church out just like he did the man the the Sun out like like he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him not part of creed not part of the church not part of the denomination but part of him hewed out hewed out of any other kind of a form won't work you've got to be hewed out from the word the world cut off of you and just leave the word only live in you the great sculptor is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires in the last days I'll pour my spirit out upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy Christ is the identified Masterpiece of the word made flesh you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the Masterpiece for his bride now Brethren God had a masterpiece then to present to the world now he wants a masterpiece today amen so he's not just a he's not just pointing now Jesus is the Masterpiece he he now wants a bride to be the second part of the Masterpiece amen amen that everything the bride did I mean sorry the groom did the bride does the life that he lives she lives because she's part of him amen amen so he is now looking for a bride to come to her position hallelujah amen so now this is what he's looking for and if he's looking for it he's going to give the ability he's going to release his word in the season for the bride to come to her position now so because you know the enemy the enemy is you know the creation Now this now the second Eve there has to be a people that raise up back to their rightful position that rise up above this present world that rise up above the works of the enemy that rise up again above their first nature that they were born with amen that rise up above Creeds and dogmas of men that rise up above what other people think of them amen they take God God has preeminence over them in everything that they say and do Hallelujah there's are people that are called to rise up above this world and stand and walk Victorious and you might as well say it's me Lord here I am amen because if he if he has caused that to be he gives you the ability to do it amen I mean he doesn't put something in you impose it upon you now you got to be the bride you got to be the word you got to be perfect without first giving you what you need am mean because Grace is the imparted power upon a person to live the word that is the true grace of God than Lord hallelujah and we have friends we have what we need in this hour Amen to live the word to be the word amen am mean you already have in you remember you sat in darkness once upon a time I mean like the woman at the well she sat in darkness and she could have read Micah 7 say rejoice not against me my enemy amen I shall arise she didn't know what she was looking for but she knew there was something more to life than what she had amen she knew it was more than just well we know when Messiah cometh she wanted more than just a same and then the very son of man came to her revealed himself and mean the Lord lighted upon her Hallelujah and she and her eyes came open she knew this was more than a man this was more than a Prophet this is more than a Healing Ministry me but she was pulled by the very presence of God Amen Hallelujah and she never went back to her old life she could not live above amen she went from one man to the other looking for love in the wrong place she couldn't break that cycle Jesus broke the cycle amen Just Let Jesus Break the cycle this power and this message brother says end time message meets end time conditions amen so whatever we face out in the world this message meets the conditions amen hallelujah we don't need Psychology we don't need m in a bookstore amen we have what we need Hallelujah we have what we need in this world Amen it is what it is friends I wouldn't read Purpose Driven Life because he's joined the Catholic church amen he's yoked himself up that's right oh but he says good things the serpent said a lot of good things too but didn't make it true am amen so we have the ability now there's a people you know we think of the Rapture and we always think of the body change amen but that's just the end of the process that's right the Lord the Lord descends he does three things as he's as as he descends we know these things you know he descends with a shout of voice and a trumpet amen and the and the end of that process is the change in these bodies but there comes a time where you know the bride I'll just put it this way the bride is already raptured that's right because the Rapture means the catching away you've been caught up amen and the now this we're still in this flesh we're still looking for the change of in the body you understand amen but the bride has been caught up above this world that's why you go back you know the devil always likes to point you to the negative things you failed here you did this wrong here you always fight this thing and you failed hey Abraham Abraham and Sarah failed every month until 25 years later then they received the child they failed every month they couldn't overcome it but God in his season Abraham didn't look at the symptoms he rejoiced in the promise meant to be the Sons and Daughters of Abraham according to the faith I can't overcome this just look at the promise hallelujah amen look at the promise don't look at what you maybe you perceive as a failure in you Hallelujah am amen and then so there comes a time where the where the bride now is lifted up and the things that you know you just take your own life you go back however many years before this message found you before the Lord lighted upon you before his word came across your your path you fought things and they beat you around and you couldn't overcome them and you were struggling and you just couldn't do it but then one day he came amen and he lifted you up thank you Lord amen you may you may you know it's not like he just flicks the switch and everything's just 100% you overcome some things he just takes you this from you like this other things you have to wrestle with cuz he wants you to be victorious amen but you must recognize the battle may be long but you have the power to to defeat it amen you have the power and so now he lifts you up because you know I you know I go back over many years 10 years I didn't recognize I came from God went back to God I just thought everything was here and now one day you lived in that kind of state and everything's here and now and dollars and cents and station and life and how many friends you have how much good time you have and whatever whatever religion you think you had but then one day he came amen and he lifted you up hallelujah hallelujah you're still in these bodies but your mind is you're totally different you know your soul is been lifted up yes sir Hallelujah and the life in you now governs your life and you think differently now you act differently now things that you once responded to in a certain way you respond a totally different way why is that because you've been lifted upen hallelujah you've been lifted up amen above things and you see things now for what they are amen the bride has already started to rise amen I'm just telling you now the bride has already started to rise the Rapture is for the raptured hallelujah amen if you've been caught away amen hallelujah if if the voice amen this end time message if the voice means more to you than life itself amen and you and just there's something in you Lord I love you I want to live to please you not that I could earn anything amen but but I want to please you you've been caught up amen Hallelujah it is what it is am amen amen so now the bride is starting to make her Ascension and then now the time when she starts to ascend is the time when Satan begins to be cast down hallelujah amen amen now there comes a time and I'll show you that this is the time amen now we read in Job chapter 1 there was the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them oh thank you brother apprciate so there was a time when Satan could go up before the Lord anytime he wanted to amen but then we come down into Revelations chap 4 and 5 and there's a totally different scene amen we understand that John is a symbol in the book and he's a symbol of you amen amen and then so now at the end of the lady of in church age Revelations 4:1 behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show you these things which must be Hereafter so John is lifted up into an eternal realm at the end of the seventh Church age and John is a symbol of you amen and then so John is lifted up into the very throne room of God where Satan was allowed to go one upon a time but then there comes a scene now where the lamb steps forth and takes the book amen and then and then so I'm just I'm just doing an overview you can go read Revelations 4 and 5 and then so John he sees the Lord sitting upon the throne he sees the 4 and20 Elders he sees the germs and the angels and all the redeemed amen because the 4 and20 Elders in part they do represent the redeemed because when he takes the book in in Revelations 5:9 they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals therefore I'm sorry and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the 4 and 20 Idols fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and hath made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth so they are they're representing you amen so there's the redeem there's God in the throne there's the cherubims there's the Angels but there's one person not in the SE Hallelujah that was once here in Job chapter 1 but he's not here when the lamb takes the book Satan is not there Hallelujah the accuser of the Brethren has been cast down amen so when the lamb takes the book amen Satan is falling from his position amen hallelujah Satan is falling from his position amen but when the lamb takes the book there is a people that are ascending to their position amen because it's when the 4 and20 Elders those that are redeemed they say and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth amen a king has a Dominion amen you have made us you have made us Kings and Priests you have given us a Dominion now remember God wants us to be expressed as time he doesn't just want to get rid of the devil then make you a king and priest he wants you to make you an overcomer now am I mean he wants he wants the devil under your feet now he wants to take the power of Calvary and wave it inner people in front of the nose of the devil and say look what my blood does look what my word does hallelujah look what my Redemption does that's what he wants to do and he wants to use you to do it amen look at what the opening of the word does hallelujah hallelujah amen and there you are and God wants to use you hey he took Jesus if I put it this way and he said this is my first this is my second Adam Satan look at him here he is he has dominion over you every enemy had to bow to him then hallelujah and she is part of him and then now I'm going to have a second Eve upon the Earth and every enemy must bow to her Voice Hallelujah every enemy must bow to you amen amen we have been placed in a position you got to recognize who you are Hallelujah you're not someone in slavery in darkness wandering around I mean youve be made a king and priest what Dominion do you have over the world am mean over Satan and his devices hallelujah hallelujah and you're a priest what was a priest who stand between God and man so you can when people come and pray pray for me and then you pray for them and God hears your prayer Hallelujah you can intercede for people yes sir we have this now oh one day now now we have this position God Is Lifting Up a people you know so you we need to look Beyond these five senses of what we think we are amen and recognize this is what God has done amen hallelujah glory to God that's why we see when we pray doesn't matter when the bride prays god listens and according to God's will things happen Hallelujah and the enemy must bow to you he's got to recognize in the name of Jesus every every knee must bow every tongue confess oh that's one day no it must be expressed in time God's Victory must be expressed in time first Hallelujah and you are that if you're the word the devil has to bow to the word amen and if she is the word she is him the prophet says you are part of him you are him amen because the husband and wife are one yes s amen I don't feel that way just confess it amen amen Caleb said Joshua and Caleb said we're more than able to take the land they just confessed it hallelujah hallelujah they knew they' been taken from the slave pits am mean their eyes had become open the Lord had lighted upon them God came down and a prophet Moses and they recognized this wasn't Moses is doing this wasn't his ambition or even their ambition that's what God's doing and then knew if God took them that far there to the Border he can take them all the way and how about you oh they had confidence you know who do you identify with in the scripture with when you read about David killing Goliath I say I'm David amen hallelujah cuz he was expressing as a shadow of Meen amen when I see Esther I see me when I see Ruth I see me when I see you know if I was living in the days of Noah one of someone would not have made it into the book cuz I would have been there eight Souls were saved y amen amen you know if there only two going into the promised land I think Caleb wouldn't have made it cuz Joshua was the one that actually Place him in the land I would have been the other one amen amen oh no that's just that's just talking a bit too highly no if you're a real believer now you be a real believer then if you're a make believer now you'll be a make believer then amen so don't identify with core and Dayan and all these other things identify with the real believer we're more than able to take the land why more than able cuz God in this end time has sworn by himself yes amen let's go to let's go to Revelations chap 10 now we Hallelujah we picked up last time we're talking about this age Hallelujah sees him as he is we see the face of God we're not guessing we're not guessing what he loves what he doesn't love who he is is he 3215 whatever know he one that's right and we know him we know the person Hallelujah and and I saw another Mighty Angel wait let's just read let's just read Revelations 9 and verse1 I just want to show you Satan is Fallen you got to you know if if if he is if he is beating you down just go read the end of the book hey if if if the start is true and the middle sure is true the end sure is going to happen as well amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen just remind the devil amen now don't bait him to try and bite you but just say hey satan this is you right this is your end this is where you get off and you burn I continue on the script for me goes into eternity you have an End Amen Hallelujah now and the fifth angel sounded Revelations 9:1 and I saw a star fall from Heaven unto the Earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit now this is now notice this star fell this is Satan opening the bottomless pit which has already happened but he fell he didn't come down at his own choosing but he fell that's right amen he fell from his position in heaven and fell Hallelujah but then in Revelations 10:1 and we'll go into these things uh yeah we've already covered these things we'll go into it later and I saw another Mighty Angel come down Hallelujah this one didn't fall this one didn't come down against his will you know when someone Falls when they're pushed the person pushing them you know they have no say they've been push they're falling that's right it's not they choosing they get pushed that's right but if someone comes down it's actually well they've chosen now I'm here that's now I've arrived I've chosen to do this now Hallelujah and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head and his face as it were uh as it were the Sun and his feet as pillows of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the scene his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as it were a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices I'll come back to that soon and when the seven Thunders had out their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that there in are and the earth and the things that there in are and the Sea and the things that there in are that time should be no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now so this Angel swore by him that created all things this Angel is Christ amen amen this is Christ coming down and he created all things amen amen so he's swearing by himself amen that now is the time where there shall be that word no longer in my Marin actually he says there shall be no more delay so he's swearing by himself there shall be no more delay I'm going to wind up my Plan of Redemption Hallelujah I'm going to bring it into Satan's kingdom and his works now is the time where the Millennium is going to come in My bride is going to come to her position they shall arise this what he's swearing by himself I'm going to do it amen amen and then Paul when he speaks in Hebrews about Abraham he and he's speaking about God giving a promise to Abraham he said because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself and at the confirmation of an oath there ceases all Strife in Hebrews so when the oath is confirmed all all all Strife is over rest is there amen so when he comes to you and he confirm terms to you personally this is my doing I'm going to make you like me you're made in my image amen and he confirms that to you is rest amen cuz he swore by himself he's going to do it it's actually you're his workmanship I know we probably say that you know it's such a easy thing just to Rattle off you are his workmanship the work he started he will perfect is that not what he said amen so if you are his workmanship if he is swearing by himself you're going to be made in my image all the all the uh responsibility is upon him all you have to do is yield yourself to the word cuz he's a gentleman remember he doesn't force himself upon anyone you have to be willing to yield yourself just like he says in doors in a door the prophet says open the door in your heart let him come in and he'll do it amen amen you've got to open every door just yield yourself yes sir that's right hallelujah amen so he has sworn by by himself that this is the hour where these things are going to be amen and we and we know very well that Revelations 10 this has been fulfilled yes sir Amen brother Braham said that the seventh angel quoting the scripture he says the seventh angel is on the time of the year is on the earth at the time of that coming Revelations 10:1 so he's already descended in this form amen he's already sworn by himself time shall be no longer I'm going to wind up my Plan of Redemption I'm going to make you in my image amen amen hallelujah he sworn by himself he's going to do it yes sir amen but now so if this is so then the Ascension of the Bride As I said has already begun yep and the devil is being cast down Hallelujah where once the devil had control now he is falling from his position and the bride is ascending to her rightful position as God over the Earth amen that's why that's why you can have your home and it's like heaven amen the devil tries to come and you you cast them out he has to obey you amen there's sickness you pray Hallelujah and either God delivers you like this or he gives you the faith that you can just because sometimes remember if he just does it like this all the time where's the character being built I mean where because Faith worketh patience amen so if you really have faith however God replies you'll say praise the Lord amen hallelujah that doesn't mean you have unbelief Faith worketh patience sometimes sometimes it's like this sometimes got to bear it for a little bit brother Ram had the stomach Affliction about seven times then finally end of his ministry then the Lord healed him on the wings with Snow White Dove amen it doesn't mean he was an unbeliever when he had the stomach thing hallelujah amen so now is the time but you see now the these seven Thunders that Ed their voices that John was not allowed to write they were sealed up until the time of the end so there came a time and it's already happened where these Thunders have been made known to an end time people amen because now maybe I just got to jump back of but when I say the Lord you know when the Lord shall lighten upon me I shall arise when the word is made manifest its light yeah yeah when the word is made manifested as light so when the When when when when light shines upon you when the Lord lightens upon you opens your eyes that the eyes of your understanding come open it's through the word that he does it amen it's through the word that he opens the people's eyes it is through the word we have Revival it is through the word that people begin to recognize who they are it is through the word that these things happen so there has to be a time where the the mystery that's contained in these seven Thunders has been released that the people receive something they did not have at Pentecost amen and but God is not a god of subtraction he's a god of addition amen he built upon Luther's message of justification and Wesley came along he didn't take away justification he preached sanctification and then there's the restoration of the gifts it didn't do away with anything else it just added two and then now when Christ himself the word is revealed it doesn't take away any of the other it just adds amen so it's not a taking away it's an adding to amen but the word because there's power in the word amen if the word is received into a faith faithful heart as brother Tony said your attitude towards and me being here will will it either you'll be blessed or you won't be blessed you'll be changed or you won't be changed remember the soldiers put a put a thing over jesus' eyes beat him said if thou be a prophet tell us who hit you amen so they hit Jesus but the woman with the blood issue touched the same one and she was healed and those ones were damned and all depends upon your attitude towards the word amen amen so now if this is so now brother Bon preaching in the seals I think I said I think I said uh last Sunday when the seals were opening it was unfolding to the prophet amen that's right that was that that series of services and onwards that was a happening that was the lamb taking the book and opening the seals each night he opened another seal it was it was new to the prophet like it was to the people listening it was an event taking place and then so he says he says in the third seal he says in the third seal we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stiring no no no no sir don't think we've got revivals we haven't we've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere that's funny cuz everyone thought they had Revival in that day the bride hasn't had a Revival yet see there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it it's in the third seal and then in recognizing in your day and its message in 64 thiss afterwards what time is it brother what time is it Minister do you see the time of day and the sign you're living under amen what sign are we living under the resurrection sign amen when when when God took and maybe I'll just jump back God took a redeemed son in this day he took a member of the bride and he stepped into that redeemed son and revealed himself and showed that a redeem son amen had dominion over nature amen had dominion over death Hallelujah every every every devil in hell had to bow to what that man said amen because he was demonstrating in one man this is where the bride is coming to he had perfect dominion over nature over sickness he created you know Jesus Took bread and multiplied it he took something and then he and then he changed into something else but now God took his bride and just spoke something out of nothing squirrels all kinds of just spoke it out of nothing am Hallelujah to prove that that creative powers of vindication of this word will create the bride into his very image amen but he had Dominion to prove that the bride the many membered body around the earth will have the same Dominion amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen that's the sign we're living under the resurrection sign I'm so glad we're alive today Hallelujah can you understand it do you see it everywhere there now there's no Revival everyone's complaining ministers crying I was reading uh one of the outstanding papers that comes into the church a very fine paper and I know the editor I know the people and they're godly people very fine brother and sister Mo The Herald of his coming one of the finest papers on the field remember Brother Moore was a campaign manager for brother brandham yeah amen so he was right there sound a trumpet no sorry uh they will hardly print anything unless it's about fast pray fast pray sound a trumpet how many reads it you know you said all the time fast pray fast pray let that's all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great breaking of the day there's a great thing going to happen all you pray pray pray we're not too late why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening and and a Revival is an Awakening they're crying believing that they there will be awakened they're good people what is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride Sea by doing by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something's supposed to happen see but they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you remember he says it will take the seven Thunders to stir the bride and he says and recognize you day this message already happened they have missed the Awakening of the Bride why has this why has this message opened your eyes because it opens the eyes of the Bride amen hallelujah if it has opened your eyes and you couldn't leave it if you wanted to amen it means you're one of them amen amen look at the effect of the word in your life that's all you need to do the devil will show you you're a failure he only shows you negative he doesn't show you that you now you're an overcomer more than you were Hallelujah as you're growing to the very fullness and stature of Christ amen like a baby I would never give Gabriel the keys to go to the store buy some milk and come home she can't do it amen oh that's ridiculous but then some people look at themselves and say why can I not overcome these things maybe you're still in diapers that's not a bad thing as long as life is growing amen I don't I don't I don't give Gabriel a you a good box law because I don't give her a box law but you know I don't give her a smack because she falls over amen she's a baby but my life is in her Hallelujah and she's growing more and more maturing every day Hallelujah few months ago she couldn't even walk and now she can walk amen hallelujah and just so just look at your life what is happening to me go back a year well I was you know this part of me you know yeah I wasn't walking with God like I thought I could and look at you now what's happening there's life as long as there's life in the body growing that is the main thing look at that the devil never point you to that Hallelujah he'll never point you to the good things he points you to the bad yes but just look what has this word done to me that's what has it done has it transformed me has it Chang me from the person I want I'm not that person that person I don't even know that person I don't think like that person I don't act like that person may be minute as long as there's life in the body hallelujah look at what the word is doing to you because only God can do it to you amen hallelujah now a direct question questions answer 64 have the seven Thunders which equals the seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet but are yet not known to us as the seven Thunders yet that's the question answer no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about Hallelujah that's right they was to reveal the seven Thunders had Ed their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is the messenger to the seventh Church age which is the prophet so he's saying the seven Thunders that's what the Seven Seals were about Hallelujah so a power has been you I read all those things to show a power has been released to awaken the bride Hallelujah and if you have been awakened by this word what has happened you're arising amen you're ascending to your rightful position in him and it's his doing amen it's not you're doing amen hallelujah now I I think I've mentioned this many times but we understand when brother Baron preaches the Rapture message he goes to psalms 27 as his opening text because to me that Psalm shows the condition of the believer that's ready for the Rapture amen and so this this Psalm it speaks about the Lord is my light and my salvation of Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life and whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies might foes come upon me and eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing I've desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me up upon a rock now if God has Quicken this word to you you cannot deny it you could not you you could not go become a Catholic or Pentecostal or what you cannot deny it because he set your feet upon a rock and it doesn't matter about all the arguments you know all the intellectual arguments on the internet when you hear the voice you know one guy said that the mystery of um um some guy in Nigeria can't remember his name uh TB Joshua he said the ministry of TB Joshua eclipses out of brother brandham okay that that's strong words because you know what eclipse means it just totally you it's totally greater okay so we go watch him in his prayer lines and then we watch that and then we watch the end of the deep course of the deep amen it's a totally different thing and when you watch when you watch the Deep call the Deep there just a presence comes into the room Hallelujah and you see one is scripture one is not yes amen so how can how can someone say no this is greater than this it's not amen but but sadly I could say if someone turns that way they're not their feet is not upon a rock yet amen but if your feet are upon that rock nothing can talk you out of it nothing can persuade you why did the Christians give their lives the little light they had in the Dark Ages amen and they could be burned they just gave themselves they rejoiced about it why cuz their feet were upon a rock hallelujah how much more the bride of Christ in this day when Jesus fully revealed himself am hallelujah amen now and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I'll sing I'll sing praises unto the Lord amen but then now you read these things and you say well well I just keep falling and stumbling I must not be in Rapture condition remember when the enemy came against me when the wickedy of my enemies my foes Came Upon me eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell not you you you didn't stumble and fall they stumbled and fell Hallelujah so you know the Devil comes along and says well you keep falling and stumbling you must not be in Rapture condition so therefore you're not one of the Bride amen that's what he always goes He the devil always goes to your identification amen that's right he never says you're not a Christian he says you're just not one of the Bride you're not going in the Rapture and he comes and says that to you cuz that's the one thing you want in life is to go on the Rapture hallelujah amen now you got to get that out of your thinking amen you're looking at the wrong thing the devil always point you to the negative and not what God has done for you already now I've already said these things I'm just going to repeat it look where he has taken you from already whose life has been changed amen who has started to rise Hallelujah doesn't matter what church you grew up in what churches you went to when this message came your way things happened I mean you begin to rise above above the world now if he has brought you this far can he not take you the rest of the way amen can he not do it am mean Caleb and Joshua they could have said that at cish by near God brought us this far can't we go the rest of the way hallelujah amen look what he's taken you see can't you have confidence that he'll take you the rest of the way now Israel left Egypt under the blood of the Lamb did they not I mean eating the lamb and the unle bread and it gave them the strength they needed to go all the way into the promised land Caleb said I was I'm as strong now as I was when I came out amen because he came out under the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah so all you need to do is you need to keep eating the lamb HJ and the UNL bread which is the word of this hour keep feeding upon the word and it will give you the strength to go all the way Hallelujah there's power in the word this word is is is the transforming power of God that's been released upon the Earth sir as I said why why was the all the creation in in in brother br's Ministry you know the manifestations of the third pole that was a Vindication what he is speaking is is creative power it's not a Healing Ministry it's not even well I understand the Bible amen but of course the word has become over but there's creative power in the message to transform you and what you were into a very son and daughter of God amen amen that he would take because remember there's seed upon the Earth but light had to shine Amen in Genesis there was Darkness over it you sat in darkness amen but then God pushed back the darkness Hallelujah he said let there be light and then the water was separated then the Earth then the light struck the Earth warmed it up then the seed came forth hallelujah what it's meant to be and that's what's happened to you and I I me we were in darkness they said when the Lord lights upon me I shall arise Hallelujah and that's what we're doing and don't put it off don't put it off in the future someplace don't look at well I've been battling this thing maybe for 30 odd years there Comes A Time friends World War II wasn't one in a day just because they had to evacuate dun Kirk and they lost the continent all these things the Allies didn't quit that's right amen of course they wouldn't quit they're still fighting but then some Christians say well I can't win and the enemy is expanding and I and then they just kind of want to throw up a white flag don't throw up a white flag amen the word Works hallelujah hallelujah sometimes you need to read Gathering need to reinforce and you know but the word works it doesn't matter at the end of the book it doesn't matter who wins the battles you know George Washington lost a lot of battles before he crossed to Delaware you go read about it he was outmaneuvered he was all kinds of things he lost a lot of battles but then when they crossed to Delaware and they took a certain place then the victory begin to happen Abraham Lincoln lost elected office not just president I mean you know other ones before he went to president 11 times apparently wow but there was something in him because he saw he was down at a slave market one day and he saw men being women being sold as slaves and he said I'll I'll hit this thing even if it cost me my life there's an ambition in him I want to end this man should not be in slavery anymore and it doesn't matter how many defeats he had the Civil War wasn't looking too good for the north even though it wasn't all about slavery but you understand it wasn't looking too good initially but there's something in them we're going to win this war there's enough gumption in them we're going to keep fighting Hallelujah if that's just natural things how much more Supernatural things I mean I've been fighting this thing for a long time but I'm going to win I mean I read the end of the book and I win hallelujah it's all done hallelujah you just going to look at the end of the book amen it's like them there in the Passover time grandma can't even walk I heard Tim pro say this I just like this illustration Grandma's on the bed and they say come Grandma we're going to go Moses said we put the blood on the door tonight we're leaving Egypt says I'm sorry I can't walk I can't I can't make it to the promised land and then so they say here hey Grandma eat the lamb have some unleaving bread next thing you know is you get cuz there's strength in the lamp and she begins to walk around give me some more of that Hallelujah and then next thing you know she's the first one out the door Hallelujah just keep eating the lamb amen keep eating the word amen hallelujah hallelujah amen just keep feeding on the word you'll be surprised don't get all tense just just listen to it say Lord minister to me doesn't matter where you are just just say Lord minister to me because it's in that word that word is made for you if you haven't recognized it behold I send you Elijah the prophet Lord amen before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord to turn you back to the original Faith so that's a love letter sent to you to prepare you hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord I've heard it many times listen to it one more time amen no doubt Mary heard Isaiah 9:6 quite a few times but that last time it anchored in her like it never had before Hallelujah I've heard the tapes many times listen to it again read the Bible again you don't just read it once put on the Shelf say there it I know it all you read it again don't you hallelujah hallelujah now keep feeding upon the word because Jeremiah asked a question is there no B and Gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered is there no B if I had to me this in the message is the same thing so I don't have a message book I hold this up is there no bom in the word is there no B and Gilead yeah there is amen amen there's there's healing power in the word and I'm just not talking about just just physical healing emotional healing spiritual healing complexes all these things God there is a great physician sometimes we look at the physical things so much what about the deep emotional things deep emotional scars God can heal all of them amen he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from all their destruction Psalm 107:20 he sent his word why did he sent his word to heal them amen amen and to deliver them from their destructions has he not done that amen well I've got this thing in me there comes a time when that thing must go amen yes sir and there's healing in this message to destroy that complex destroy that whatever it is that maybe you may be Waring in something I cannot overcome this thing no no no no no don't look at I cannot overcome I have not overcome yet and I have in me the power to destroy this thing amen God you know know it's like a box you a good boxing match is not over in the first punch they want them to go 12 rounds amen sometimes God wants you to go 12 rounds with the devil that's right amen and you can lick him every round amen but just to show how good you are hallelujah amen hey a good boxer oh that was a fluke he goes 12 rounds man he's good amen God wants you to overcome sometimes it's like this sometimes you got to wrestle against it amen but the my the Bible tells me no weapon formed against me shall prosper amen amen no weapon no weapon so if that is true and it is then no weapon formed against you that weapon may have been used against you in your youth it shall not Prosper amen or your middleaged or whatever age you may be something that happened when you young and you couldn't escape it it just happened to you I'll tell you this no weapon Hallelujah formed against you will prosper Lord hallelujah there's an expired date to all the devil's Works amen but we'll be shining like the sun and it won't even be remembered all we'll remember is we have the victory Hallelujah now he says in the Rapture message three things a voice of shout a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now let physically remember now shout Jesus does all them all three of them when he's descending a what is a shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride he doesn't just say these things are they flower Isn't that cool no the message is the living bread of life that brings forth the bride that's why I say just eat the word am listen to the word why cuz it's a living bread of life that will bring forth the bride am it will bring forth what you're meant to be amen hallelujah that's what he said amen amen he say Well only two made it out of Egypt as asked the question who are you identifying yourself with in the Bible amen all Israel started off in the slave pits did they not they're all slaves but there were a couple of them that Rose above the slave mentality so that's why I've been pondering this for a while ask this question you may have come out of Egypt but has Egypt come out of you right amen right and I'm not just talking about religion I'm talking about the world yes and well this is how the world thinks are we meant to think like the world thinks if we've Arisen yes amen we should not think like the world thinks amen what is the world wanting status material things everything on the surface just to be just dandy amen you know and it's all about the here and now look live for the moment no I'm Living For Eternity amen that's amen because I know where I I came from where I'm going amen oh just just do it cuz it feels good no I do whatever I do cuz I love him and I want to please him amen amen so if you've been risen up above all why don't we do like what the world does we're have a different Spirit we're of a different nature and it's not your your desire that made you that way it's ultimately God's desire he has put the desire in you to respond to him hallelujah thank you Jesus amen so we it is God's doing I'm just going to I'm going to close with this it is God's doing that the bride is rising Hallelujah and if it is God's doing that's why I said I said ultimately it's God's doing but we're living in an hour of the Ascension of the Bride now the devil hasn't become incarnate yet but he he has fallen amen amen because it says it says in it says in wait let's just read that Revelations chap 12 I had it on my notes but we didn't get there Revelations 12 and: 7 now he called the accuser of the Brethren amen but there comes a time when he's cast down as I've said and there was war in heaven this is Revelations 12:7 there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accuses them before our God day and night he has no right to accuse anymore and they overcame him this is Is You by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives until the death therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time that's why he is going overboard with his plans CU he knows he just has a short time but how they Overcoming By the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony amen what is what is it's not your testim only what God has done for you you are giving witness that this message is God Christ manifested in this age amen amen if God said it about me I believe it Hallelujah and that's how they overcame amen that's how you overcome so he has been cast down we are ascending hallelujah hallelujah amen let's stand shall we amen let's Rejoice Hallelujah God is rising us up it's his doing the powers in the word hallelujah we're not a bunch of slaves amen don't be a slave to your first nature or your circumstances or whatever is happening in your life don't be a slave to iten am mean God has come to raise you up above those things hallelujah hallelujah amen can we just sing um I keep listening to a different sound amen aren't you glad to be a believer in this end time Hallelujah every enemy must bow to you amen we've got the power in the name of Jesus Hallelujah we are rising
