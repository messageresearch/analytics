[3:15] Christ they may you grant it amen bless
[3:19] you friends you may have your seats this
[3:20] morning I mean I'd like to if I could
[3:22] take a I can take a a title or I'd like
[3:27] to speak about a full manifestation I
[3:30] want to continue so I just go down maybe
[3:33] just hold my notes like this but I want
[3:35] to continue along the thought that I was
[3:37] I was I was speaking on on on Wednesday
[3:41] and I just pray that you know as as this
[3:45] time goes along or as as long as you
[3:47] know we are walking in this earth with
[3:48] the Lord that he would just anchor into
[3:50] our hearts the reality of what we have
[3:52] you know a greater reality you know we
[3:54] see as the world is locking down and and
[3:57] you know you're the you know the beast
[3:59] power is taking over the world and
[4:00] trying to shut the Christians down and
[4:02] all these you know change the economics
[4:04] of the world and do all those things you
[4:06] know I trust that as we see that become
[4:08] a reality that we should see what we
[4:10] have as a reality as well I mean so you
[4:13] know you know brother brems says in the
[4:16] field
[4:17] he says this he says you see these
[4:20] things that we are now that we're
[4:21] studying right now is after the churches
[4:24] gone to speaking of the Great
[4:25] Tribulation see these things in the
[4:27] period and I think it ought to be truly
[4:30] settled in every believers heart at this
[4:32] church never takes a tribulation period
[4:34] cannot put know where the church and the
[4:37] tribulation now is gonna clarify this
[4:38] now he says you put the church there but
[4:41] not the bride see the bride has gone on
[4:43] cuz see she has not one sin not a thing
[4:46] against her the grace of God has covered
[4:49] her over and the bleach has took every
[4:51] sin so far away there is even a
[4:54] remembrance of it not not a thing but
[4:57] purity perfect in the presence of God oh
[5:01] it ought to make the bride get down on
[5:03] her knees in order to cry out to God
[5:04] holier for us to realize with is not
[5:07] once and held against us yeah yeah hey
[5:10] on Calvary you know he took all of our
[5:12] sin our iniquity I mean our secret false
[5:15] everything that could be held against us
[5:17] he carried that out Calvary way and is
[5:21] not one thing held against the Bride of
[5:23] Christ I mean we are as God as pure were
[5:26] as perfect as God is perfect not because
[5:29] of our own selves and what we can do but
[5:31] it's what he has done that matters
[5:34] [Applause]
[5:35] hallelujah so I think you know they
[5:38] ought to make us just drive us to our
[5:40] knees and praise God hallelujah I mean
[5:43] there's such a wonderful thing so I pray
[5:45] as we continue journeying on that will
[5:47] become a greater reality you know it's
[5:51] amazing it seems such a paradox in this
[5:54] day where we're at season Isaiah 60 and
[5:56] one you know brother bran would preach
[5:58] the message Shalom from these myths
[6:00] scriptures but where it says a rise and
[6:03] shine for thy light has come and the
[6:05] glory of the lord has risen upon me for
[6:08] behold the darkness shall cover the
[6:09] earth and gross darkness the people but
[6:12] the Lord shall raise upon thee and his
[6:14] glory shall be seen upon thee now that
[6:16] that scripture is alive today that even
[6:21] when the prophet stood upon the earth
[6:23] and preached Shalom because we know when
[6:25] a prophet speaks something he sees it in
[6:28] its full manifestation even though when
[6:30] he is standing upon the earth just be in
[6:33] seed form so even even when brother
[6:35] brand would preach that you know the
[6:36] Holy Ghost was was moving more freely
[6:38] among churches you know God was you know
[6:41] in the church drum he was doing a lot of
[6:42] things but you know and when there be a
[6:44] disaster people would call upon God but
[6:46] nowadays it seems that no one calls upon
[6:48] God no more there's no even there's not
[6:51] doesn't even seem to be an anger against
[6:52] him why does he allow this and you know
[6:54] how it used to be just a few years ago
[6:56] it's like the idea of God has truly left
[6:59] the people's minds they're not even
[7:00] aware that he's upon the earth I mean so
[7:04] so we can see unsaddle II a gross
[7:07] darkness does cover the earth does cover
[7:09] the people but as it is so dark but yet
[7:12] is also so light Amen there's never been
[7:14] a light that shines so bright as in this
[7:16] thing when the darkness is only there in
[7:21] the absence of light so if light is
[7:22] there darkness cannot stand in the
[7:24] presence of light so it must it must
[7:26] flee Amen it's you because darkness is
[7:29] just the absence of light it's not a
[7:31] power in itself I mean but we see that
[7:34] gross darkness covers the people but I
[7:36] mean the glory that was risen upon us
[7:39] our light is shining hallelujah so it's
[7:42] such paradox where this great darkness
[7:44] but yet great light at the same time you
[7:47] know it's incredible I was I was just
[7:49] looking and you know yeah I know it's
[7:51] trending at the moment but this but
[7:53] because of this virus covert 19 I read
[7:56] on a on a website science alert calm
[7:59] it's estimated that 2.6 billion people
[8:02] or around 1/3 of the world's population
[8:05] are under some form of lockdown right
[8:07] now oh one third of the world's
[8:09] population is restricted at its movement
[8:12] in some form right now so one you could
[8:15] say one third of the world is shut down
[8:17] I mean and that of course will have
[8:18] great ramifications on the economy as
[8:21] we're era as we're aware of but you know
[8:24] it just goes to show that the world is
[8:26] falling apart everything that people
[8:28] have held on so dear for material things
[8:31] and wealth and prosperity those things
[8:33] that just put a vapor and they're gone I
[8:35] mean there's a people upon the earth
[8:37] that they're not looking to the things
[8:40] that are seen but things that are unseen
[8:41] I mean the eternal things I mean I mean
[8:45] so now we read in Luke 21 because I want
[8:48] you on y'all you know I just want to
[8:49] point out a couple of things I can see
[8:51] it now
[8:52] he spoke of them a parable
[8:54] of the fig tree and all the tree so he's
[8:57] saying it's not just when the fishery
[8:59] put forth its buds but when all the
[9:01] trees put forth their buds now we know
[9:03] from the scripture that that the fig
[9:05] tree it speaks of Israel as a nation
[9:07] blooming forth again you know we don't
[9:09] have time to read it but you go read
[9:11] Jeremiah 24 and this and and Jeremiah
[9:14] sees a vision of two baskets of figs and
[9:16] the interpretations given in that in
[9:18] that chapter that they're actually the
[9:20] people of Israel and we know a tree
[9:21] doesn't only speak of a person but
[9:23] speaks of a nation so he says when you
[9:25] see the fig tree put forth its buds and
[9:27] all the tree so it's not just it's not
[9:30] just Israel as a sign but it's them and
[9:33] everything else and we can see in this
[9:35] day that you know everything as as
[9:37] putting forth its buds it's growing his
[9:39] prey its bearing fruit I mean where it
[9:42] was just in a seed for maybe when the
[9:44] Prophet was here now it's come to its
[9:45] maturity you know the tears have come to
[9:48] their maturity the bride has come to her
[9:50] maturity you know we're living in a day
[9:52] of full manifestation I mean all that
[9:54] the word is is now being being being
[9:56] made flesh but I want you just to just
[9:59] just hold it in your heart where where
[10:00] Jesus would say heaven and earth shall
[10:02] pass away but my words shall not pass
[10:05] away so so he's saying that that has he
[10:08] said heaven earth can change they can go
[10:10] away they can pass away but his words
[10:12] could not so if his words cannot pass
[10:15] away they will manifest exactly what
[10:17] they're intended to manifest now I know
[10:19] if probably you know you know I've
[10:20] spoken on these things you know in the
[10:22] past but I just wanted to become a
[10:24] greater reality Oh hallelujah so no no
[10:28] brother brand makes a statement now I'm
[10:29] gonna get to David I mean cuz I see it
[10:31] you know y'all read the scripture that
[10:32] he was gonna be anointed and I'm gonna
[10:34] come to him as a context but you know he
[10:37] sees in the message Church of the Living
[10:38] God in 1951 he says listen close any
[10:42] redemptive blessing that's written in
[10:44] the words now there's no need of you
[10:46] arguing of it whether it's in the
[10:48] atonement if it's in the word God a
[10:50] sovereign and has to fulfill his word
[10:52] for heavens and earth will pass away but
[10:54] my words shall not pass away
[10:56] he says if God said so God is worth no
[10:59] more than his word and if his word is no
[11:01] good then he is no good if your word if
[11:04] you can't put no confidence on what you
[11:06] say you're no good but
[11:08] you're just as good as your word is and
[11:10] God is just as good as his word us and I
[11:13] as a Christian believer I believe that
[11:15] this Bible is inspired it's written by
[11:16] the Holy Spirit and it is the infallible
[11:19] Word of God and God is under obligation
[11:22] to his word to the believer that will
[11:24] accept this word and any word as a seed
[11:27] if you're accepted in your heart by
[11:28] faith and believe it and confess it God
[11:30] will bring it to pass I mean so God is
[11:33] obligated to his word he has to fulfill
[11:36] it now we got to understand when God
[11:38] said Let there be Sun Moon and stars he
[11:41] you know or when God made any promise he
[11:43] never changed that promise he never
[11:45] diluted that promise he never said oh I
[11:47] didn't mean that just you know just if
[11:50] the circumstances got harder or it
[11:52] appeared like it was impossible that it
[11:53] would ever happen he didn't say no I
[11:55] didn't mean that I was just joking I
[11:57] just you know I had a funny day that's
[11:58] why I said that no he what he says he
[12:01] means and if he means it and he says it
[12:03] I mean he has to fulfill it doesn't
[12:05] matter how impossible it seems or how
[12:07] how unlikely it will ever be that's
[12:09] irrelevant I mean if God said it would
[12:12] be it will be
[12:13] hallelujah see so he doesn't back up he
[12:15] doesn't you know the devil challenges
[12:17] his word God doesn't back up on that
[12:18] challenge he says evil I'm gonna
[12:20] manifest my word in the midst of you it
[12:22] doesn't matter what you try and do about
[12:24] it it's gonna happen
[12:25] hallelujah so now he says in the Misses
[12:29] perseverant he says god's word can't
[12:31] fail he has never failed and he can't
[12:34] fail that is one thing God can't do
[12:36] that's failed he cannot fail and God is
[12:39] his word so that's one thing God can't
[12:42] do he can do all things but why
[12:43] doughnuts fail
[12:44] amen and he's not gonna fail now if he
[12:46] never failed in the beginning he can't
[12:48] fail now because he's the great
[12:49] unchanging God
[12:51] Ilia so he never failed in the beginning
[12:53] and he never failed in the middle he
[12:54] can't fail at the end because he's lying
[12:56] God changed me I mean everything he was
[12:59] when he created all things he's the same
[13:00] God today everything he wasn't the
[13:02] prophets he's the same God today
[13:04] everything he wasn't he's just Christ
[13:05] the days of his flesh he's the same God
[13:07] today I mean everything he was in the
[13:09] prophets ministry he's the same God
[13:11] today hallelujah so we must have
[13:13] confidence heavens and earth will pass
[13:15] away but my words could not pass away
[13:16] and then his word cannot fail hallelujah
[13:20] it's impossible
[13:21] god don't change his mind about his word
[13:23] he has never backed up a watered-down a
[13:25] promise or change a promise because of
[13:28] circumstances gets too hard or
[13:30] impossible for his word to be fulfilled
[13:32] he cannot fail Amen that no that should
[13:35] be out yo the first thing in the morning
[13:37] God you cannot fail hallelujah amen
[13:40] glory doesn't matter how dark the world
[13:42] gets he cannot fail he's gonna stop them
[13:47] now you can stop nothing will stop him a
[13:50] man we're gonna have that confidence God
[13:53] nothing can stop you
[13:54] yes sir lorry now brother bran would
[13:57] would would speak about dry sand and the
[14:00] message lifting him up out of history
[14:01] and to me it's one of my favorite
[14:03] messages and driest when you know we
[14:06] know dry his his only child his daughter
[14:09] was second and then and then he saw the
[14:12] doctors couldn't help her so so so
[14:15] brother Brown says it wasn't dry as his
[14:17] house where the doctors had failed and
[14:20] turned the little girl back to die and
[14:22] death had come in and taken its bit of
[14:24] toll and had taken the only child the
[14:26] home the little girl of 12 and stretched
[14:29] her out on a couch when a brokenhearted
[14:31] little preacher had to forsake his
[14:34] denomination and all of his friends but
[14:36] he remembered that there was a God of
[14:38] history who could raise the dead and he
[14:41] went to find him I lost and he went to
[14:45] find him hallelujah seek and ye shall
[14:49] find knock and he'll be opened unto you
[14:51] ask and it will be given unto you he is
[14:54] still the same God as God dwelling in a
[14:57] body called Jesus the Son of God when he
[15:00] was called on the scene called up out of
[15:02] history the God who could raise the dead
[15:04] in the Old Testament could bring back
[15:06] life to a dead baby through a prophet
[15:08] that God cannot die for he is that He is
[15:11] God for eternity it may be laying there
[15:14] on the bed stretched out a little driest
[15:16] knowing that the shunammite got her baby
[15:18] back he said that god of history if he
[15:21] could ever be called into action he's
[15:22] the same God today and searching through
[15:24] he had heard of some man that claimed to
[15:27] have the power that was Jesus of
[15:28] Nazareth who they all hated but he
[15:31] called him on the scene for he was the
[15:33] closest represent
[15:35] then tative representative uh he could
[15:38] find of God at that day a God of the
[15:41] Living God and when he was called on the
[15:43] scene and the historical God was called
[15:45] up he acted the same way he did when he
[15:47] spoke to Elijah on that dead baby let me
[15:50] say more let me more say today my
[15:52] brother's sister in this present day
[15:54] when crisis when cancer is eating the
[15:57] world up and diseases of all kind the
[15:59] same historical God that cleanse a leper
[16:01] healed the sick raise the dead is the
[16:04] same God today
[16:05] he's waiting anxiously for his people to
[16:07] call him on the scene of action amen one
[16:10] who could forgive a harlot for
[16:12] committing adultery seven times a day he
[16:15] who could cleanse the vilest sinner and
[16:17] make him white as a lily that same God
[16:19] of history lives today to clean every
[16:22] blackened heart of sin and unbelief and
[16:27] call them out
[16:28] Amen in this time of crisis hallelujah
[16:30] call them on the scene Amen call what
[16:32] I've seen for yourself and for your
[16:34] family he's waiting for you to call him
[16:37] on the scene God's Word cannot change
[16:43] because it's eternal as God is eternal
[16:45] because he is his word it's amazing we
[16:48] take for granted when we read the
[16:49] scripture where it says in the beginning
[16:51] was the word and the word was was with
[16:53] God and the Word was God amen just the
[16:56] reality that God is his word divine
[16:59] promise I mean the right mental attitude
[17:01] to it towards any divine promise of God
[17:04] will cause it to come to pass and he
[17:06] means the right mental attitude towards
[17:08] us towards God's Word God your word says
[17:10] all happen I mean you promised this to
[17:12] me cause it to come to pass I mean we
[17:16] should never pardon me we should never
[17:18] have the attitude or maybe it will
[17:19] happen or maybe it could work we should
[17:21] have the attitude Lord you've done it
[17:23] before you'll do it again in a few you
[17:26] know if you're feeling worried and down
[17:28] I mean just begin to read through the
[17:29] description everything that God has done
[17:31] I mean begin to listen to some prayer
[17:33] lines begin a list of the testimonies of
[17:34] the believers I mean you'll begin to
[17:36] realize our God is alive if there's no
[17:39] way he's not dead he's not he's not
[17:41] sleeping someplace he's alive today
[17:43] hallelujah
[17:45] a man I'm looking for the full
[17:47] manifestation of third pulled myself
[17:51] we're shut away that you're the prophets
[17:53] and it won't be a public show I mean
[18:01] maybe I just get too excited I don't
[18:04] know I mean we should believe for things
[18:07] that man cannot do I mean God steps in
[18:10] and doesn't allow circumstances in life
[18:13] from us to realize I mean God allows it
[18:16] that we come to a spot where we come to
[18:18] the end of ourselves and we come to our
[18:20] wits in that's when God can step on the
[18:22] scene amen and Psalms 119 verses 89 and
[18:28] 90 it says for ever O Lord thy word is
[18:32] settled in heaven my faithfulness is to
[18:35] others unto all generations thou has
[18:38] established the earth and it abideth so
[18:40] he's telling us that his word has
[18:43] settled forever in heaven amen
[18:45] hallelujah God's Word is settled in
[18:48] heaven it's already done I mean it you
[18:50] know you're as far as God thinks yo yo
[18:52] it's got you as far as God sees you he
[18:54] sees you around the throne and redeem
[18:56] remember he's eternal he's outside of
[18:58] time I mean remember we are creatures of
[19:00] eternity just having to have an
[19:03] experience in time I remember this world
[19:05] is not our home we are just passing
[19:09] through that into our souls I mean
[19:17] rapture is us just going home after this
[19:20] brief journey upon the earth praise the
[19:23] Lord thank you know to speak just on God
[19:27] not failing in terms of healing
[19:28] salvation and deliverance is only half
[19:30] the picture but I want to speak more
[19:33] about today of the prophetic side of
[19:36] God's Word I mean so it so it's easier
[19:39] to say yes he's a healer and yes your
[19:41] although all those divine promises but
[19:43] when it comes to God's prophecy when he
[19:46] has spoken something forth I mean that
[19:47] cannot read that cannot fail you know as
[19:50] it would say in Isaiah that you know
[19:52] that my word will not return unto me
[19:53] void a mean but it will accomplish that
[19:55] which our purpose sent it to do it means
[19:58] for now
[19:58] so let's just take our opening scripture
[20:02] I mean that we read about about Samuel
[20:04] going to Jesse's house oh he told God
[20:08] told God told Samuel I have a king
[20:11] prepared for me among Jesse sons when
[20:13] when when God told Samuel to go down to
[20:16] Jesse's house he already knew that David
[20:18] would be anointed king so when God gave
[20:21] that promise to 2 Samuel and God's mind
[20:24] was David right and God's mind was David
[20:26] upon the throne that was part of that
[20:29] promise right so when God when God
[20:31] promises anything he already knows
[20:33] exactly who's going to fulfill it right
[20:35] he doesn't just throw a promise out
[20:37] there like behold a virgin shall
[20:38] conceive and it's like a lolly scramble
[20:41] and the right person grabs it now now
[20:43] the promises there's no it doesn't work
[20:45] that way I mean when God speaks a
[20:47] promise forth he knows exactly who will
[20:49] fulfill that promise and nothing can
[20:52] stop that person fulfilling that promise
[20:53] hallelujah I mean nothing can stop them
[20:56] fulfilling that promise so when God said
[20:58] through Isaiah behold a virgin shall
[21:00] conceive I mean and God's mine Mary was
[21:03] their fulfillment of their prophecy
[21:05] right I wonder if anyone it was Mary it
[21:08] was one woman that was going to manifest
[21:10] that promise hallelujah so when samuel
[21:12] was told by God to go to Jesse's house I
[21:15] meant God knew that David was going to
[21:18] fulfill their promise hallelujah
[21:21] I mean even even when when God would
[21:23] speak to Jeremiah and in the first words
[21:26] that the Lord ever spoke to Jeremiah was
[21:28] before I formed thee in the belly I knew
[21:31] thee and before thou camest forth out of
[21:33] the womb I sanctified thee and I
[21:35] ordained thee a prophet unto the nations
[21:37] so God is telling Jeremiah and I think
[21:40] you know I was thinking about Jeremiah's
[21:42] life he was living in a great time of
[21:44] change by the end of his life Jerusalem
[21:48] would be destroyed the the other nation
[21:50] would be carried away captive he was
[21:53] living in a time when the world was
[21:54] falling apart and he had to stand there
[21:56] in the gap and called to Israel no
[21:58] matter what they did with the word no
[22:00] matter what what they rejected didn't
[22:02] matter he had to stand there in that
[22:03] time I mean and he had to speak a word
[22:05] to the people to try and get them to
[22:07] turn back to God and and because he
[22:10] lived in such perilous times I believe
[22:11] that's why
[22:12] told him before you're in your mother's
[22:15] womb I ordained you for this job I
[22:17] ordained you for this purpose Jeremiah
[22:19] you're you you're already my prophet
[22:21] before you're conceived even before your
[22:23] parents thought of you I thought of you
[22:25] and I'll show you when this office is a
[22:27] prophet and it's not that maybe you'll
[22:29] you'll become one you already are one I
[22:31] mean he's gonna skip into your role and
[22:32] home and fulfill the Word of God that's
[22:34] been allotted to you and that's the same
[22:36] thing with us friends it's not a lujah
[22:39] amen so he had to tell them it and and I
[22:43] believe that's why we're living you know
[22:44] why why God would would place us under
[22:47] this eagle anointing where we could see
[22:48] from eternity to Eternity is that we
[22:51] would be able to stand in this parallel
[22:53] stay where we can see that we came from
[22:54] God and we go back to God and and that
[22:57] should give us such a stability in our
[22:58] walk wholly the reason that I believe
[23:01] this message is because I'm part of this
[23:02] word I mean I didn't just maybe this
[23:04] haphazardly even though many times we
[23:07] think God you know we just stumbled into
[23:09] this thing we didn't stumble into this
[23:10] thing hallelujah saw before we were ever
[23:14] conceived amen before we're ever in our
[23:17] mother's womb he or dangerous to be the
[23:18] Bride of Christ amen let's just enjoy
[23:22] the ride to get there again hallelujah I
[23:24] mean God gave gives a promise to Abraham
[23:27] I'm just wanting to show this to you
[23:29] because you know we we have to just
[23:31] remember God predestinated us to a
[23:33] position mmm his word will not return
[23:37] unto Him void right his word cannot
[23:39] return unto Him void so if he has
[23:41] predestinated us to that position we're
[23:44] gonna get there now thinking member
[23:47] nothing can stop God's Word
[23:49] nothing can hand yo sure the devil try
[23:52] and hinder the devil try and stop you
[23:54] but God will get you there
[23:58] now we read here in Genesis 15 and verse
[24:00] 13 and he said unto Abram know of a
[24:04] surety that thy seed shall be a stranger
[24:06] in the land that is not theirs and shall
[24:08] serve them and they shall afflict them
[24:10] for hundred years and also that nation
[24:12] whom they shall serve will I judge and
[24:14] afterwards they shall come out with
[24:16] great substance now I know I know it may
[24:19] be very elementary but we can see it
[24:21] from the scripture that Moses has not
[24:23] mentioned by name at all and this
[24:25] promise
[24:26] when God spoke this to Abraham God had
[24:28] Moses in mind
[24:29] I mean God you know that knew that Moses
[24:31] would be the deliverer God knew that
[24:33] Moses would be raised up in Pharaoh's
[24:35] house Amen God it ordained it thus but
[24:37] when God gave the promise when God gave
[24:40] the promise to Abraham to Abraham
[24:42] I mean Moses has not mentioned but Moses
[24:45] was part of the fulfillment of their
[24:46] promise yes Amen now God and then it's
[24:54] the same thing as we keep reading down
[24:55] when God would God would out lie the
[24:57] Western and the eastern borders of the
[24:59] promised land he says that thy seed will
[25:01] will possess from the UM from the River
[25:05] Nile
[25:06] he says the great river of Egypt under
[25:07] the great river Euphrates he was he was
[25:09] outlining the borders and then he also
[25:11] said about and then he listed all of the
[25:13] nations that the children of Israel
[25:15] would drive out so he said in that same
[25:17] day the Lord made a covenant with
[25:19] Abraham saying unto thy seed have I
[25:22] given this land from the land of Egypt
[25:23] and to the great river of the the river
[25:25] Euphrates the Kenites and the kids and
[25:28] nights and the Cadman nights and the
[25:30] hittites and the perizzites and the
[25:32] rhythm ins and the Emirates and the
[25:34] Canaanites and the gershonites and the
[25:37] jebusites amens he says this land that
[25:39] these people are in that is that is thy
[25:42] seeds land but he never mentioned
[25:45] anything about Caleb or Joshua I mean
[25:48] because remember Joshua took the people
[25:49] into the land so so when when when God
[25:52] was giving this promise to Abraham a
[25:54] meant God and his mind you who will
[25:56] fulfill the promise right predestined
[25:59] there's a lot those that would fulfill
[26:00] that promise
[26:01] Amen so so Caleb and Joshua they were
[26:04] not mentioned but they will power the
[26:05] fulfillment of that scripture hallelujah
[26:07] now you know it's the same thing when
[26:09] you take you know I'm just gonna take a
[26:11] few through the scripture just take
[26:12] another one that's very obvious just to
[26:14] highlight this highlight this truth you
[26:16] know when Isaiah would speak and he
[26:18] would say in in Isaiah 40 and 3 the
[26:21] voice of one that Christ in the
[26:22] wilderness prepare ye the way the Lord
[26:24] make straight in the desert a highway
[26:25] for our God now John was never mentioned
[26:28] by name in that scripture John didn't
[26:31] say a man called John the Baptist will
[26:32] fulfill the scripture he just had a
[26:34] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[26:35] and John
[26:37] and the fulfillment of that scripture
[26:39] amen but when God said to you know when
[26:44] god inspired isaiah to speak that word
[26:47] john i god saw john fulfilling that
[26:50] scripture cuz he was the manifestation
[26:53] of that scripture Allu you easily know
[26:57] there's a principle through the
[26:58] scripture that i've just gone through
[26:59] that when when god gives a prophecy he
[27:02] knows who's gonna fulfill it right he's
[27:04] know he knows who's going to be the
[27:06] manifestation of that prophecy remember
[27:08] God's Word cannot fail right so remember
[27:11] he says behold a virgin shall conceive
[27:14] behold a virgin shall conceive and it
[27:16] happened right Israel was in slavery in
[27:19] Egypt they came out and dwelt in the
[27:20] promised land it happened I mean a voice
[27:22] of one crying in the wilderness
[27:24] it happened hallelujah all these things
[27:26] remember God fulfills his word by
[27:29] bringing it to pass amen now let's just
[27:31] jump to the promise of Albay and I'll
[27:35] say this God knows exactly who's going
[27:36] to fulfill this let's go to revelations
[27:40] 19 and 6 I mean I love the scripture
[27:53] don't you let's just look at the promise
[27:58] of our day this because this is what the
[27:59] message is seem to produce and I heard
[28:02] as it were the voice of great of a great
[28:04] multitude and as the voice of many
[28:06] waters and as the voice of mighty
[28:08] thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord
[28:11] God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad
[28:14] and rejoice and give honour to him for
[28:16] the marriage of the lamb has come and
[28:17] his wife hath made herself ready and to
[28:20] her was granted that she should be
[28:22] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[28:24] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[28:26] of saints and he saith unto me write
[28:28] blessed are they which are called into
[28:30] the marriage supper of the lamb and and
[28:32] he saith unto me these are the true
[28:34] sayings of God so know when when when
[28:38] John when John saw this when John was
[28:43] inspired to write he saw this in symbol
[28:44] form God knew exactly who would make up
[28:46] this number that would be called to the
[28:48] marriage supper of the Lamb God knew the
[28:50] ones
[28:50] would be arrayed in fine linen clean and
[28:52] white that would be the Lambs wife I
[28:54] mean even even in the scripture win when
[28:56] it says later in the Book of Revelations
[28:58] I'll show you the Lambs wife hallelujah
[29:00] now that was just in simple form and we
[29:02] know that the the book of Revelation is
[29:05] in simple form but yes I mean it has to
[29:08] become a reality
[29:10] it goes from simple form to reality form
[29:13] I mean we can even see this you know
[29:15] well it's it's very evident when when
[29:18] you look through the seals and you see
[29:19] the you know the horse riders the right
[29:21] of the Antichrist spirit down through
[29:23] the ages we can see it went from a
[29:24] symbol form to a reality form now that
[29:27] is the case on the on the negative side
[29:29] then how much more the case on the
[29:32] positive side I mean so that so so that
[29:35] it's just a simple form of the marriage
[29:37] supper of the Lamb but now it's become a
[29:38] reality form I mean we're a people would
[29:41] be would be prepared to meet the Lord a
[29:43] minute where our people would be united
[29:45] with him in this life hallelujah because
[29:47] that's what the true baptism of the Holy
[29:49] Ghost does it unites you and Christ
[29:51] together as one unit I mean it unites us
[29:54] together and we know that we're living
[29:55] in a uniting time and in the world is
[29:58] uniting I'm in darkness is uniting Amen
[30:00] but so is Christ and the bride United
[30:02] leader and it's and it's happening I
[30:05] mean we are living in the fulfillment of
[30:06] that scripture so so these are people
[30:10] upon the earth now I just want to I know
[30:12] this may be very obvious but I want to
[30:13] show I just want to bring this out
[30:15] because remember we should appreciate
[30:17] what we have I know we should appreciate
[30:20] what God has done for us and the
[30:22] cleansing of the blood and your
[30:23] everything he's done for us Ilia so so
[30:26] there's a people that would be made
[30:28] ready she would make herself ready no
[30:30] but but we read here in the scripture
[30:32] this is how she makes herself ready is
[30:34] it it was granted to her that she should
[30:37] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[30:38] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[30:40] of saints I mean so the Lord already has
[30:43] the wedding garment prepared I mean the
[30:45] Holy Ghost the Word made flesh in you I
[30:47] mean that's the that's the wedding
[30:49] garment remember it's not our
[30:50] righteousness
[30:51] it's his righteousness I just say this
[30:55] you already you know you're already
[30:56] wearing the garment and if you become on
[30:59] with em you're dressed holy in his
[31:02] righteousness I'm in yours your
[31:04] to go thank you
[31:08] I mean so now this is not a assemble no
[31:10] more this is reality form this is a
[31:12] manifestation upon the earth I'm
[31:14] actually looking at people over over
[31:16] zoom here that are arrayed in fine linen
[31:18] clean and white the races of saying
[31:22] thank you I mean because remember this
[31:25] message brother ham says the bridegroom
[31:27] call will come right through this right
[31:30] man that there are people's hearts we
[31:31] turn back to the original faith of the
[31:33] fathers amen they'll become one with the
[31:35] word today I mean so so the scripture is
[31:41] fulfilled today now the Word of God we
[31:43] know is a seed and just like a natural
[31:46] seed it has to be planted in the right
[31:48] soil watered and then and the time and
[31:51] then and then in time the life that's in
[31:53] that seed will produce itself and it's
[31:55] only when it does that then you can see
[31:57] really what it is a menaces you know you
[31:59] just take in the natural you know a lot
[32:01] of seeds they do look the same and I
[32:04] used to work for a company that it
[32:05] wasn't in my my my part of the lab but
[32:08] there was a lab in Palmerston North and
[32:10] they were the seed lab and they had the
[32:12] study seeds to make sure that the seeds
[32:14] that were given to farmers to plant they
[32:16] were the seed that they were buying and
[32:18] they spent I don't know how long
[32:20] studying seeds before they actually were
[32:22] put into you know you're put into the
[32:25] workforce to test the seats that were
[32:26] given so but you know the people had to
[32:28] examine them now at that stage you could
[32:31] say well it would be easy just to plant
[32:32] the seed and you'll see what it is but
[32:34] they had to send them out and seed form
[32:35] first and then the manifestation was
[32:38] later when it was planted so you know
[32:40] it's only when the life of that seed
[32:42] comes forth you can really see what's in
[32:43] that seed oh we read in Luke 21 because
[32:47] it's now in the fig tree and all the
[32:49] trees put forth their buds you know
[32:52] summer is nice and now life life has
[32:55] come to its full manifestation and now
[32:58] we can finally see what's in the what
[33:02] what is in people yeah but there's only
[33:04] true powers in the world mmm is God and
[33:07] Satan those are the two powers and those
[33:09] two powers are being manifested in the
[33:11] earth yeah amen whether we like it or
[33:14] not those two those two powers of
[33:17] manifest
[33:17] so now Jesus would speak and he say that
[33:22] the Word of God is a seed and he also
[33:24] spoke of the parable of the sower the
[33:26] four types of ground now those four
[33:29] types of ground are still in the earth
[33:31] remember these four types of ground they
[33:35] are people right they are the hearts of
[33:37] people now he says here in investments
[33:42] he says and father I spread forth the
[33:44] seed I know when it falls into that
[33:46] predestinated ground it'll light up and
[33:49] shine blowing for the glory of God is
[33:51] his help us father we commit this to you
[33:53] now in the name of the Lord Jesus now he
[33:56] does say that preaching the word is like
[33:58] scattering seed but God knows that the
[34:00] ground that it will fall on and produce
[34:02] the crop that he's intending it to do
[34:04] hallelujah so he also says and works as
[34:08] faith expresses is now here producer
[34:10] planners in Plainview just like in it
[34:13] just as other seed the Word of God is a
[34:15] seed and must have the ground prepared
[34:18] beforehand if you sowed seed just thrown
[34:20] it out there on the ground that would do
[34:21] no good the birds would pick it up you
[34:23] throw it among thistles and thorns it'll
[34:26] choke out pretty soon Jesus parable said
[34:28] so so the ground had to be made ready
[34:31] first
[34:32] so God and sovereign grace prepares the
[34:34] heart first he prepared you before the
[34:37] foundation of the world to receive it in
[34:39] the stage was he for me who you by his
[34:42] foreknowledge and ordained into eternal
[34:44] life he knew you therefore he prepared
[34:47] you I mean so he will be upon the earth
[34:49] member like he said to Jeremiah remember
[34:52] he said to Jeremiah before you're in
[34:53] your mother's womb I ordained you I
[34:55] think the prophet to the nation's and
[34:57] it's exactly the same thing with us
[35:00] before we were in our mother's womb I
[35:02] mean he sanctified us he ordained us
[35:04] amen to be his bride I mean to be the
[35:06] Bride of Christ I mean so we were I mean
[35:09] those who truly received a word in this
[35:11] day they are the prepared ground
[35:13] hallelujah God before the foundation of
[35:15] the world prepared our heart receivers
[35:18] word in this day hallelujah Amen so
[35:25] remember it's not just the fig tree
[35:28] that puts forth its buds but it's all
[35:30] the trees brother Brown speaks of
[35:33] another tree called the bride tree and
[35:36] he would say in in Psalms one and one he
[35:41] says blessed is the man that walketh not
[35:43] in the counsel the ungodly nor standeth
[35:45] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[35:47] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[35:49] in the law of the Lord and in his law
[35:51] doth he meditate day and night and he
[35:53] shall be like a tree planted by the
[35:55] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[35:57] fruit in his season his leaf also shall
[35:59] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[36:02] prosper I mean so he speaks of the
[36:05] bright tree and and you know he he says
[36:08] that it was planted on the day of
[36:10] Pentecost but then the Antichrist spirit
[36:12] came until finally in the Dark Ages it
[36:14] was just chewed down to a stump and he
[36:16] goes into the book of Joel and he speaks
[36:17] of the cankerworm farm worm caterpillar
[36:20] and locusts he speaks about the four
[36:21] stages the Antichrist spirit chewing the
[36:24] bride tree away til it's just a stump in
[36:26] the dark ages then the heart says I
[36:28] shall restore that saith the law now
[36:31] there has to come a time that what was
[36:33] growing in the day of Pentecost would be
[36:35] what would come forth again hallelujah
[36:38] and now remember we're living in the day
[36:41] of full manifestation yeah I mean it's
[36:44] not just Israel coming to their position
[36:46] it's not just the tears coming to their
[36:48] maturity but the week is going to her
[36:50] maturity as well he's coming to her
[36:53] benefit full manifestation manifestation
[36:57] under weasely or Luther I mean or even
[37:00] under Pentecost but a full manifestation
[37:01] of all the Word of God is manifested in
[37:04] a people hallelujah Amos day friends
[37:07] we're living in this day what is the
[37:10] full manifestation where God becomes

[38:38] is there he's planted not just stuck
[38:40] down he's actually planted that's right
[38:43] a lot different sticking a stick in the
[38:45] ground in planting something that's
[38:47] different the seed was planted it found
[38:49] its own root hold when the water begins
[38:52] to come in and break forth its life the
[38:54] spirit it begins to say you say there

[39:18] over there he can't die it's right in
[39:21] the stream of life it keeps spreading

[39:27] about me hallelujah that is a life
[39:29] pulsating forth amen is above the whole
[39:31] ego eimi nothing that's put on or
[39:34] patched on or covered up it's a life
[39:36] that's coming forth even if we shut it
[39:39] make God's living God's flowing as well
[39:41] as manifest
[39:43] [Applause]
[39:45] before I mean why because the rivers are
[39:48] flowing remember if I say that the word
[39:53] of God cannot fail that doesn't mean
[39:55] we're like sitting in the stands eating
[39:57] popcorn seeing seeing what will happen I
[39:59] mean but we're active in the word say
[40:00] Lord Here I am
[40:03] I mean Lord put on flesh and me like
[40:06] never before now not just spectators I
[40:10] mean we are not just spectators we are
[40:12] on the field
[40:13] hallelujah we're on the field of battle
[40:15] amen that's how we sure he's planted by
[40:22] the rivers rivers coming from every side
[40:24] rivers of water
[40:26] I wonder he can't whither I mean you
[40:28] can't where the children don't worry
[40:29] no I'm that some of them seed fell over
[40:33] there he can't die it's right in the
[40:34] stream of life it keeps producing that's
[40:37] right it's for life out of them rivers
[40:39] rivers the New Testament the Old
[40:41] Testament amen just being fed right
[40:43] there on through our brother entered and
[40:46] today this age that we're living now
[40:48] there is a bride tree coming forth see
[40:50] truly the tree has come up and they as
[40:53] soon as they organize they couldn't go
[40:55] any farther what happens they organize
[40:57] and go out on the slimmed in the Lumas
[40:59] pruned according to st. John 15 chapter
[41:02] he prunes them off they'll never use no
[41:04] more but the heart of that tree comes
[41:06] forth the fruit right on the top of it
[41:08] when the tree is fully matured it can't
[41:10] go no further right on the top the last
[41:13] church ages here she's a full mature
[41:16] it's a bride hello leo
[41:19] I happen to believe that look I believe
[41:24] we're not just a like an infant church
[41:27] or a newborn Church but now the Bride of
[41:29] Christ is a mature woman I mean she
[41:31] knows what the Lord was done with his
[41:32] word hallelujah amen now we know that
[41:36] the as as Jesus say by their fruits you
[41:39] shall know them they meant by so that's
[41:43] why you know as in the tree amen so now
[41:47] we know that that in this day that the
[41:49] capstone should come down upon a people
[41:51] divine love himself I mean should come
[41:53] down upon a people and join himself with
[41:55] the Church of the Living God that's the
[41:57] age we're living in right
[41:58] Amen that's right so when we go into
[42:01] first Corinthians 13 now we can see that
[42:03] this is more than just speaking about it
[42:05] now let's go to first Corinthians 13
[42:11] hallelujah
[42:15] please go hello yeah so first
[42:25] Corinthians 13 and 1 this is the Apostle
[42:30] Paul speaking though he sees here though
[42:35] I speak with tongues of men and angels
[42:37] and have not charity I've become a
[42:39] sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal I
[42:41] mean so this charity we know is divine
[42:43] love it's God Himself God is love not a
[42:45] just a you know you know turn a blind
[42:48] eye and let you go on but it's a real
[42:50] love it's it's God's own love which not
[42:52] based on anything we do but it's God the
[42:55] election amen but now he's speaking
[42:57] about when charity is manifested member
[42:59] this is the age of charity this is the
[43:01] age of perfect love I mean member I mean
[43:04] we're living in a bride age right we're
[43:07] living in a bride age you know when you
[43:09] know you know the world has gone on
[43:10] until you know it continues on until
[43:12] ADOC a rich increased with goods have
[43:14] need of nothing they don't need nothing
[43:15] they don't need God they don't need
[43:17] anything but what they can do amen but
[43:20] but the but now the bride Amen is called
[43:24] out of Lady osya and up into a bride age
[43:26] I mean what God is manifesting his word
[43:28] and his bride amen
[43:31] I mean you could say an age within an
[43:34] age and you go see when brother baron
[43:35] speaks about a bride age he speaks about
[43:37] it all in the latter part of his
[43:39] ministry and the reason that is is
[43:40] because lady Arcia
[43:42] because of creeds and dogmas kicked
[43:44] Christ out of the church so so he's an
[43:45] outside of his church as was prophesied
[43:48] of this age he says behold I stand at
[43:50] the door and knock If any man will hear
[43:52] my voice I'll come unto come unto him
[43:55] and he will sup with me and and and in
[43:57] him with me so so Christ is on the
[44:00] outside of his church and this day
[44:01] trying to get back in right so so now
[44:04] God is no longer manifesting himself and
[44:08] his fullness and later seer
[44:10] so people are but he says if any man
[44:12] hear my voice and open the door and and
[44:14] and and I'm out basically then now
[44:17] there's a union of marriage going on so
[44:19] now it's a bride age and now we know him
[44:21] in a marriage is love I'm in a marriage
[44:23] I should be our marriages should be
[44:25] driven motivated by love by men know
[44:28] what you can get but what you can give
[44:30] hallelujah Amen and and that's how a
[44:34] family should be governed should be
[44:36] motivated by love era our actions how we
[44:39] treat our spouses how we treat our
[44:41] children how we treat each other should
[44:43] be motivated by divine love and nothing
[44:45] else that's how it should be because
[44:48] we're living in the age of divine love
[44:50] no remember it's a great contrast in
[44:53] this day gross darkness but this great
[44:56] light I'm in the you know that you know
[44:58] the love of many as wax cold
[45:00] unfortunately the Bible said it would
[45:02] but there's a people that are in love
[45:03] with the Lord Jesus Christ I mean that
[45:05] have returned to their first love in
[45:07] this hour now I'm looking at a people I
[45:09] believe that have returned to their
[45:10] first love amen amen
[45:14] no so he says that I speak with tongues
[45:17] of men and angels and have not charity I
[45:19] become as a sounding brass or a tinkling
[45:20] cymbal though I have the gift of
[45:23] prophecy and understand all mysteries
[45:25] and all knowledge and though I have all
[45:28] faith so I could remove mountains and
[45:30] have not charity I am nothing so it goes
[45:33] to show that we can know all the
[45:35] mysteries right he says though I know
[45:38] though I understand all mysteries so we
[45:42] can actually in the stay understand all
[45:44] the mysteries we can actually have an
[45:46] accurate complete timeline of what God
[45:49] will do in detail from now till the
[45:50] rapture but we can still miss it if you
[45:53] have not divine love God Himself
[45:54] manifesting through your life I mean
[45:56] you're not gonna be there
[45:58] amen so we can know all things see
[46:01] that's why it's such a trip people get
[46:03] caught up and do an increase of
[46:04] knowledge if I just understand what God
[46:07] is doing in this hour then I'll escape
[46:09] the wrath no if you know who will escape
[46:11] the rest you're the spirit of truth will
[46:16] lead you and guide you into all truth
[46:17] but my confidence isn't the fact that I
[46:21] know at the end therefore I'm going to
[46:22] take a rapture my confidence is I know
[46:24] him of the power
[46:25] Resurrection Rose I will raise I mean I
[46:29] have a body like his glorious body Holly
[46:31] I have eternal body waiting in the
[46:33] heavens for me already
[46:34] Rory thank you not as not that I may
[46:40] know all mysteries and I will put it out
[46:42] perfectly in front of you that you could
[46:43] see it it's not that that I know him I
[46:45] mean I see charity I see divine love
[46:49] manifesting through my being
[46:52] amen amen
[46:54] that's how we're gonna be lord help us
[46:56] make us more like you remember this the
[46:59] scripture we're reading has to put on
[47:00] flesh and this is the album and remember
[47:04] God's work cannot fail so if God says
[47:07] it's gonna happen it's gonna happen
[47:08] we'll help us Lord Jesus I know all my
[47:13] goods to feed the poor and though I give
[47:15] my body to be burned and have not
[47:17] charity it profiteth me nothing charity
[47:21] suffereth long charity suffereth long
[47:24] and is kind charity envieth not charity
[47:27] vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
[47:30] does not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[47:33] not her own is not easily provoked
[47:36] thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in
[47:39] iniquity but rejoices in the truth
[47:41] beareth all things believeth all things
[47:44] hopeth all things endureth all things in
[47:47] charity never faileth me but God cannot
[47:49] fail that's the one thing he cannot do
[47:51] but whether there be prophecies they
[47:54] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[47:55] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[47:57] it shall vanish away for we know in part
[48:00] and we prophesy in part now this in part
[48:03] means in the Greek it means is a section
[48:05] or allotment it means a division or a
[48:08] shear so it's just a portion that what
[48:10] it means by in part right so though we
[48:12] prophesy though we know in part we
[48:14] prophesy in part but we net which is
[48:17] perfect has come now that word perfect
[48:19] means complete the fullness I mean we
[48:22] know in this day that the mystery of God
[48:24] should be finished right so we now have
[48:26] complete I mean when the complete has
[48:29] come in that which is in part shall be
[48:31] done away so that's not saying now many
[48:34] people many many message Baptist will
[48:36] take the scripture and say well we don't
[48:38] need the gifts of the Spirit
[48:39] we don't need prophecy we're and he's
[48:41] speaking tongues we need interpretation
[48:43] tanks we need discernment we don't need
[48:44] those things store more because that was
[48:46] the in part but actually no no no that's
[48:48] part of the fullness right but they had
[48:50] it in part but that means you don't take
[48:52] away that part you just get more right
[48:55] you know that's just part of the word
[48:57] but now we have the fullness of the word
[48:59] invocation never takes away he just adds
[49:02] right now the Lutheran's had the just
[49:05] shall live by faith remember they had a
[49:06] part the just shall live by faith
[49:08] yea the fullness of justification as you
[49:11] never did it in the first place sorry so
[49:14] they headed in part but now we have it
[49:16] in fullness Luther Luther had
[49:20] sanctification Luther had sanctification
[49:22] as you've got to live a holy life they
[49:24] had a method of being sanctified
[49:25] something that they humanly did for
[49:28] their sanctification or still a work of
[49:30] God in a way cuz God helped him but they
[49:32] only had sanctification and path but
[49:34] sanctification and its fullness as God
[49:36] comes unto you he changes your desires
[49:39] so the things you once did I mean you
[49:42] cannot do no more so you're sanctified
[49:44] from them he cleanses you from them
[49:46] right smoking drinking committing
[49:48] adultery wearing ungodly clothing watch
[49:50] young Galli movies music whatever it may
[49:52] be I mean that are on unholy things
[49:55] lying and stealing cheating backbiting
[49:57] whatever it may be I mean all those
[49:59] things he sanctifies from you so it's no
[50:02] longer man trying to live a holy life
[50:03] and having a method of sanctification
[50:05] but God comes in and he is the
[50:08] Sanctifier washed by the water of the
[50:11] word I mean I mean the power of
[50:13] sanctification but so now we have
[50:14] sanctification and its fullness Alleluia
[50:18] now the now the Pentecostals had the
[50:20] gifts of the Spirit a member and every
[50:22] age the Holy Ghost was in every age
[50:25] right the Holy Ghost was in Luther's day
[50:27] the Holy Ghost was through the dark ages
[50:29] even the Holy Ghost was in Wesley's day
[50:31] amen the Holy Ghost was in the
[50:33] Pentecostal day but they had it all in
[50:35] part but now after those three things
[50:38] have been restored now he would himself
[50:40] comes down and has fullness and in
[50:42] twelves and a people hallelujah so now
[50:45] we don't have these things in part but
[50:46] we have it in fullness we have all in
[50:48] fullness or everything we had everything
[50:51] Wesley had that was of God we
[50:53] but now in its fullness everything that
[50:54] I'm loose ahead and part that was of God
[50:58] we haven't in its fullness everything
[50:59] that the Pentecostals had and part we
[51:02] haven't its fullness
[51:03] remember God doesn't take away nothing
[51:04] he adds hallelujah so everything that
[51:08] they had we have I mean because it was
[51:11] now it was it was a partial
[51:12] manifestation a partial manifestation
[51:14] their day now it's a full manifestation
[51:17] in this day hallelujah to God amen
[51:23] because he says then that which is
[51:24] perfect complete has come the net
[51:26] witches and part shall be done away amen
[51:29] so when I was a child out now the
[51:32] Apostle Paul shows us when I was a child
[51:34] I spake as a child I understood as a
[51:36] child I thought as a child but when I
[51:38] became a man I put away childish things
[51:41] why because a child is growing to
[51:43] becoming a fully mature complete person
[51:45] right so they they can they can reason
[51:47] and part they can understand and part
[51:49] compared to what they'll be when they
[51:51] are mature adult I mean so sorry saying
[51:53] when I was a child I thought in part
[51:55] right but now I'm thinking in completion
[51:58] because when when I'm a child I'm
[52:00] growing to become a fully complete
[52:02] person right I mean that's that's even
[52:05] why you know teenagers you know the
[52:07] brain develop you know is still growing
[52:09] your brain is still growing there's
[52:11] there's two parts of your brain one the
[52:13] risk-taking part of the brain is fully
[52:15] mature but then the other part of the
[52:16] brain which says is a good idea are
[52:18] still growing hallelujah that's why we
[52:21] did crazy things that we're children but
[52:27] there comes a time it comes with time
[52:30] when both parts of the brain become
[52:31] fully mature and now the chick and the
[52:34] balancer there amen so you know
[52:37] sometimes we think my what man we did
[52:39] crazy stuff well the reason we did crazy
[52:41] stuff is our brains are growing we
[52:43] thought in part but now we think of
[52:49] scientifically true we all went through
[52:57] that stage and we got out the other side
[52:59] all right
[53:01] I mean see now we put away partial
[53:07] things right and now we have the
[53:09] fullness right hallelujah amen
[53:13] for now we see through a glass darkly
[53:16] but then face to face we're living in
[53:19] that day we were seeing face to face I
[53:21] mean the veil of traditions gone I mean
[53:24] any any filter is gone hallelujah it's
[53:27] all gone now we see him face to face now
[53:30] I know in part but then shall I know
[53:32] even as I am knowing hallelujah sorry
[53:36] saying that I know in part but I'll know
[53:38] as as I'm knowing this is a day when we
[53:41] are known knows we are knowing I mean
[53:44] will we really you know it's amazing
[53:46] what the Prophet would say about we are
[53:47] the scene g'd of God we have the seed
[53:50] gene of God producer before the
[53:52] foundation world when he says we came
[53:54] from God and we go back to God
[53:59] about the statement just think about the
[54:01] statement we win when he would say
[54:04] there's only one form of eternal life
[54:06] and that's God's own life and if you had
[54:09] eternal life I mean if you have eternal
[54:11] life now it's because you had eternal
[54:13] life in the beginning amen Cecily I
[54:16] remember it was maybe dormant in our
[54:18] souls but when the word in your way when
[54:20] the Spirit of God came you act quick in
[54:22] that scene and it brought you to a birth
[54:24] and then you begin to realize all my the
[54:26] grace of God that he would call me
[54:28] before the foundation of world and Here
[54:30] I am in this day to manifest his word in
[54:32] this day and the devil can't stop me
[54:35] amen stop gods weren't coming to pass
[54:39] hallelu nice words bristle or hallelujah
[54:42] mmm he sees an alibi tooth hope faith
[54:45] and charity now abideth Hope faith and
[54:48] charity these three but the greatest of
[54:50] these is charity the grace of these is
[54:52] divine love himself amen
[54:55] this is the our alive and Friends weird
[54:58] this is manifesting now I trust that you
[55:00] can see in your life when I read through
[55:02] that scripture I mean that you can get
[55:05] that life living through you sure we're
[55:08] still a nice you know we're still a nice
[55:10] you know falling bodies we need a body
[55:12] change I mean but when you're not can't
[55:15] you should see that life living amen
[55:18] hallelujah now he would say in second
[55:22] Corinthians four diabetes for we preach
[55:24] not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord
[55:27] and ourselves your servants for Jesus
[55:29] sake for God who commanded the light to
[55:32] shine out of darkness has shined in our
[55:34] hearts to give the light of the
[55:36] knowledge of the glory of God in the
[55:38] face of Jesus Christ for we have this
[55:40] treasure in earthen vessels this

[55:49] pearl of great price you begin to look
[55:51] at it say Lord how marvelous this is
[55:52] treasure that I'm carrying amen
[55:56] mber the the devil cannot stop you
[56:00] coming to your full manifestation amen

[56:04] manifestation it's impossible because of
[56:07] God said that I'm gonna have a bride
[56:08] without spot or wrinkle I'll make you
[56:10] I'll make her in my image that she will
[56:13] have my divine nature God doesn't worry

[56:24] final and the final part of that

[56:31] treasure in earthen vessels now I just
[56:35] want to leave you with this just before
[56:36] I turn the service over to brother and

[56:40] we should look at things that are
[56:42] eternal anything else at this time
[56:46] things sure we should be aware of what's
[56:49] going on the world but don't get caught
[56:50] up in things don't worry don't stress
[56:54] about nothing remember of God before the
[56:57] foundation of the world he has ordained
[56:59] us to be his bride he ordained us to be
[57:03] his bride all right so if he is ordained
[57:05] as dust we are going to become it that's
[57:08] right we are gonna be that last
[57:10] generation I mean that that that defeats
[57:13] that last enemy which is death amen that
[57:16] last enemy will be put under our feet
[57:18] and the dead in Christ are gonna rise
[57:20] and we're gonna go and meet them go go
[57:22] with them to meet the Lord in the air
[57:23] hallelujah
[57:25] of us about day neva devil thinks
[57:27] there's no where people can go into a
[57:28] body change but God does not back up he
[57:31] does not worry how it's gonna happen
[57:33] he's ordained just to manifest it it's
[57:35] gonna be like remember nothing could
[57:38] stop David coming to the throne it
[57:40] doesn't matter how many glass came along
[57:42] how many Epsilon's came along didn't
[57:44] matter how many things were there I mean
[57:46] David set on the throne because God said
[57:48] I prepared a king in among Jesse's sons
[57:52] hallelujah mmm I'm thing with you and I
[57:55] raising pressing the battle base man
[57:58] spear we've been given a sure word of
[58:01] prophecy but now so we should look at
[58:10] things which are eternal the things that
[58:12] are not seen it's right No
[58:15] and in Hebrews chapter 11 when when the
[58:19] Apostle Paul woods would would write the
[58:21] divine commentary of Abraham's life it's
[58:23] safer they that say such declare plainly
[58:26] that they seek a country and truly if
[58:29] they had been mindful of that country
[58:31] from whence they came out they might
[58:32] have had opportunity to have returned
[58:35] but now they desire a better country
[58:37] that is unheavenly therefore God is not
[58:40] ashamed to be called their God for he
[58:43] hath prepared for them a city that they
[58:47] were so they said they're not we just
[58:49] pogroms and strangers on this earth
[58:50] we're just passing through destination
[58:54] this is not our final resting place
[59:00] faith we'd have the same revelation I'm
[59:03] just passing through
[59:05] came from God and I'm going back to God
[59:08] glory
[59:09] booyah we're just Pilgrims and strangers
[59:12] in this weary land
[59:13] oh and soon as very soon we're gonna see
[59:15] the king him as he is hallelujah we'll
[59:19] see them get in Christ rise there won't
[59:21] be any social distancing in that day
[59:29] where to God amen we should have that
[59:33] expectation yeah I mean I'm looking out
[59:36] yeah I know
[59:37] yeah you know I've said it before and
[59:38] sister Maggie knows who I'm talking
[59:40] about but I'm expecting brother blue
[59:41] Kennedy to walk through the door but not
[59:43] as an old man but as a young man with
[59:45] excuse me yeah parley and say the
[59:47] scriptures are rich and they know honey
[59:49] I know the raptures on this is the
[59:53] Blessed heart that we have we have this
[59:55] treasure
[59:55] remember the rapture as a people going
[59:58] to be where they came from
[59:59] that's right a mezra the rapture you
[1:00:02] know you know when when the Apostle Paul
[1:00:04] would say they which are alive and
[1:00:06] remain hellooo yeah I mean well not you
[1:00:10] know they which our life remain we'll go
[1:00:12] to meet the dead in Christ
[1:00:13] you know the Trussell race first and
[1:00:15] they which are alive and remain shall be
[1:00:17] caught up with him to meet the Lord in
[1:00:19] the air right it's from and that was
[1:00:21] prophesized through the Apostle Paul God
[1:00:23] saw exactly every single one that would
[1:00:26] go on that rapture so everyone he had
[1:00:29] already ordained already predestinated
[1:00:31] those that would fulfill that scripture
[1:00:33] just like Mary was predestined to become
[1:00:35] the mother of Jesus Christ that was the
[1:00:37] same thing with those ones who had a
[1:00:39] body change hallelujah so if God has
[1:00:42] ordained and I believe he's ordained us
[1:00:44] because this message has come to us this
[1:00:45] is a rapturing message right this
[1:00:47] message has come to change our bodies
[1:00:49] the spirit of John in this word has come
[1:00:51] in transform like to now think so so he
[1:00:55] seen this word to us we have received
[1:00:57] this word in the rainy days because
[1:00:59] there's a body to step into it's not by
[1:01:04] chance by chance I mean you're on this
[1:01:07] chunk oh I earned it oh it's good enough
[1:01:09] what no no that's irrelevant it's not
[1:01:12] those things God has predestinated us I
[1:01:15] mean to walk out of this world and see
[1:01:17] eternal that's right that's why this
[1:01:20] message has come to us and that's why
[1:01:22] it's a reality it's not head knowledge
[1:01:23] but God makes it live in our hearts
[1:01:30] manifestation and with that I'll close
[1:01:36] keep pressing the battleframes don't
[1:01:38] despair
[1:01:39] hmm don't worry about what you see
[1:01:41] around you
[1:01:42] about what maybe your family's doing or
[1:01:45] don't be caught up in the hysteria and
[1:01:47] the worry say Lord it's from watching
