[22:10] testimonies this morning about how God
[22:12] kept you in the earthquakes. So just
[22:14] have your seats and we're going to allow
[22:18] if there's one or two testimonies this
[22:20] morning burning on somebody's heart that
[22:22] how God kept them or kept their
[22:24] belongings or kept their business or
[22:26] kept them safe through this because we
[22:30] know that we are hidden in the rock of
[22:35] ages. Um no now we need the people
[22:38] online to hear brother.
[22:40] Sorry.
[22:44] Uh, happy birthday, Ian.
[22:47] Y,
[22:51] that's one of my testimonies.
[22:56] I made it.
[22:59] Um, no, just um, it it actually just
[23:02] dawned on me um, on Monday when when
[23:04] when I went to the shop for the first
[23:06] time. So, we're right in the CBD with
[23:08] the new cafe. Um, and there's quite a
[23:11] few buildings in the CBD, as you know,
[23:14] that that have been damaged and so
[23:15] forth. Um, now I had a shop about I sold
[23:18] it about 3 years ago, one of the mojo
[23:20] shops in town, and there was in a big
[23:21] high-rise building as well at the
[23:23] bottom. Um, and about a about a a few
[23:27] months
[23:28] before before I sold, it was about a
[23:31] year before we actually sold that shop
[23:32] there. Um there was the other
[23:34] earthquakes in Wellington that everybody
[23:35] went home on the Friday afternoon. Quite
[23:38] big earthquakes when when everything
[23:39] happened. I think it was 2012
[23:42] it was. Um now the building did have a
[23:46] bit of damage at that point in time.
[23:47] There were quite a few buildings in the
[23:48] CBD that got damaged and we and the shop
[23:52] didn't lose one single glass. So we had
[23:55] bottles all over our counters, right at
[23:58] the top, right on edges of stuff and we
[24:00] didn't lose anything whatsoever. and we
[24:02] were able to trade straight away again.
[24:04] Um, and when I went to the shop on
[24:08] Monday with all the other damage,
[24:09] there's a lot of the Mojo shops out um,
[24:12] and so forth. I went to the Mojo and my
[24:15] old shop through this earthquake has
[24:17] been trashed. So, there's glass
[24:19] everywhere with the food cabinets were
[24:21] all smashed up. Um, there's a lot of
[24:23] damage to that old shop of mine. Um, so
[24:26] it didn't fair that well this time
[24:27] around. They had all the tiles pushing
[24:29] up on each other and everything. And um
[24:32] I went into my shop and once again there
[24:34] was not even a glass that came off of a
[24:36] shelf or anything. Amen. And we have
[24:39] glasses that are stacked up to the very
[24:42] edge of a shelf. And there was
[24:45] absolutely no damage whatsoever. And we
[24:47] were able to open the next day without a
[24:49] problem. So glory to God. He protects
[24:51] his people. Hey there where you are.
[24:54] That's where the blessing follows. He he
[24:55] doesn't he doesn't he he he follows you.
[24:58] He he protects you where you go. and
[25:00] your belongings. Um, and it makes me
[25:02] think of um of the Israelites when they
[25:04] were in Egypt and all the plagues came
[25:07] and it hit everywhere, the whole land of
[25:10] Egypt except where the Israelites were.
[25:13] Amen. And it's the same for us. He's the
[25:15] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[25:42] Mama. Yeah. She come.
[25:48] God bless you. God bless you. Good to
[25:50] see you. God bless you all.
[25:53] Lovely to see the visitors. Welcome.
[25:56] Hey. Um, just a short testimony. Um, no
[26:00] me and I. We have our ups and downs at
[26:02] times. It's no doubt everybody does. And
[26:04] one of my big bug bears is getting home
[26:06] from work to a house that doesn't look
[26:09] like there's been a lot of time spent on
[26:10] it. And um, I'm sure none of you
[26:13] brothers can relate to that. But
[26:16] anyway, the internet is now so
[26:19] accessible to everybody. iPhones and
[26:23] me don't get on. My wife loves them and
[26:27] it's been a bug bear of mine for a very
[26:29] long time. I get home from work, I think
[26:31] it was on Wednesday, and um Nami met me
[26:34] at the door. She's in tears and she is
[26:38] saying, "I have been delivered. The Lord
[26:41] has taken away my habit." It wasn't it
[26:44] just interferes with life and it was her
[26:46] habit and she said the Lord's lifted me
[26:48] from it. She's listening to uh the
[26:50] prophet's message. There's a prayer line
[26:52] going on. It happened during that. I I
[26:55] walk out to the shed where my children
[26:57] are building a helicopter and um the
[27:01] Lord just spoke to me and he said the
[27:03] same anointing that was upon the word
[27:05] then is upon the word now. It's I've
[27:09] always I've always thought that but I
[27:11] thought is that the right way to think?
[27:13] is can I still draw on that power when
[27:15] it was spoken the spoken word. Amen. The
[27:17] word says in the days of the voice of
[27:19] the seventh angel, the word is alive and
[27:22] well. It's delivered my wife and praise
[27:23] the Lord, our home is changed. And glory
[27:26] be to God. Hallelujah.
[27:32] Amen.
[27:47] Um yeah, with all these earthquakes and
[27:50] and diverse places and the things that
[27:53] happening, God revealed to me more than
[27:55] just you're safe. Um he says that these
[27:59] things will happen and they must happen
[28:02] and prophecy must be fulfilled and his
[28:05] word will come to pass and it doesn't
[28:07] mean how he shakes the world and what he
[28:09] does. If we look at the
[28:11] circumstances then he will reveal to us
[28:15] what is the answer. So I asked him with
[28:17] these things cuz I was scared. I won't I
[28:19] was scared cuz I had to we were at the
[28:21] airport fetching my mom and dad and and
[28:24] uh I was scared. We grabbed the kids and
[28:27] ran out. And it's the first time I ever
[28:28] realized that I was this small.
[28:32] And then I went to the Lord and I said,
[28:33] "Lord, but I don't understand because
[28:35] I'm supposed to be this big cuz you're
[28:37] inside of me." You know, and he just
[28:39] said, and I shared it with the kids this
[28:40] morning. He said, "But it has to be this
[28:42] way. It has to be fulfilled." So if I
[28:45] look into the earthquake and into
[28:46] everything that's happening, but not in
[28:48] his word, then I'm missing what's
[28:50] happening. And so I went and I looked
[28:52] and he says in Matthew, he says in Mark
[28:54] and in Luke 21 and he says um for nation
[28:57] shall rise against nation and kingdom
[28:59] against kingdom and there shall be
[29:00] famines and pestilence and earthquakes
[29:02] and diverse places and this will just be
[29:05] be the beginnings of sorrow. But then I
[29:08] thought it's not the beginnings of my
[29:09] sorrow. It is where I started realizing
[29:12] that God is real. He takes care of his
[29:14] people and he sent his word before us to
[29:17] prepare the way. And so he's already
[29:19] preparing us to go home. And so all
[29:21] these things that happening, don't be
[29:24] scared. Take courage and walk on. He
[29:28] gives us that choice. So praise the
[29:30] Lord. And and I'm just thankful that I
[29:31] don't have to be scared of earthquakes
[29:33] because we were. Just put your trust in
[29:35] him. Amen. And he'll make it come to
[29:37] pass. So yeah, that's that's just what I
[29:39] got. I
[29:40] think Glory
[29:51] Yes, please.
[29:54] No, you don't have to. Yeah, you can
[29:56] hear in the choir mic. Okay.
[29:58] Yeah.
[29:59] Okay. I love being a Christian. Love it.
[30:04] After the earthquake when it was all
[30:05] shaking, I thought, "Praise God." You
[30:08] know, I had no fear whatsoever because
[30:11] death wear is your victory. Grave wear
[30:13] or death where is your scene? brave.
[30:14] Where is your victory? It's like, oh,
[30:16] I'm closer home. I get to go home and be
[30:18] in the arms of
[30:20] Jesus. I just love that he's taken all
[30:22] that fear away. And it was such a
[30:24] blessing because
[30:26] not some of my children have that same
[30:27] revelation yet.
[30:30] And one in particular that that is that
[30:33] is quite imaginative and and very
[30:35] sensitive. Well, she had a bit of a hard
[30:38] time with it. And but it's amazing
[30:39] because the Lord just takes away all
[30:41] that fear. And one Amen. One thing that
[30:42] brought was brought up was she also had
[30:45] a fear of spiders. And I was like, "Oh,
[30:47] you can't be a country kid. If you're
[30:48] living out in the woods, you can't smash
[30:50] a spider. I'm not going to go get a
[30:52] spider every time." And they're like
[30:53] this big. And my grandma used to smash
[30:55] them on the wall. So I would just go up
[30:57] to her and smash them with my thumb and
[30:59] oh, just get on with it. So she came to
[31:01] me one night and she said, "Oh, there's
[31:03] a spider in the hallway." And I go,
[31:04] "Just go. Look, there's no fear in love.
[31:07] When you know the Lord loves you, you
[31:09] don't have to worry because he he loves
[31:10] you. He's not going to put you in harm's
[31:13] way. Yeah. So, she she came and she she
[31:16] went back and she smashed it and I was
[31:18] like, "Oh, I didn't hear back from her."
[31:19] So, I thought, "Okay, she's taking care
[31:21] of it." And then and then in the
[31:22] morning, I went down the hallway. It was
[31:24] the biggest black spider I've ever seen
[31:26] in my
[31:27] life. It was like smashed on the whole
[31:35] floor. But it was the thing with the
[31:37] earthquake. So, it was like there's no
[31:39] fear. A Christian has no fear in this
[31:41] world. What do we have to fear? So I was
[31:44] Yeah, I was just the same and I praise
[31:46] the Lord for the opportunity to share
[31:47] with my children that there is no fear
[31:49] in love.
[31:51] Yes, God. Praise the Lord.
[32:05] Good morning. I'm the visitor from South
[32:07] Africa and I need to apologize to each
[32:08] and every one of
[32:09] you because the tongue is mightier than
[32:12] the sword. I said when I came over to
[32:15] this place of yours, this wonderful
[32:16] piece of earth, it's it's it's awesome.
[32:19] I said, I'm going to hit this place with
[32:21] a bang and I'm going to make waves and
[32:24] it literally happened. We were still
[32:26] taxiing in when the earthquake happened.
[32:29] So, watch what you say. Especially you
[32:31] little ones, watch what you say. Cuz I
[32:34] said, I'm going to eat this place with a
[32:35] bang. And it did bang. It rocked the
[32:36] place. It's still moving down again. And
[32:39] I said, "I'll make waves." And then
[32:40] there was the flood. So be careful what
[32:43] you say because your words might become
[32:45] two before you know it. But sorry for
[32:48] that. I just had to rock this place. The
[32:50] South Africans have landed.
[33:05] I was thinking and then he's talking
[33:07] about the words. What how powerful are
[33:09] the words you speak?
[33:11] So um last camp I got after camp and
[33:15] then I got just really really really
[33:17] tired and run down and um I was having
[33:19] headaches like if not every day every
[33:21] second day really bad headaches and then
[33:24] um I just
[33:26] I thought you know I was Andy was
[33:29] talking to me on the Saturday night last
[33:31] week saying I said you know I believe
[33:33] that the Lord can heal me and I was like
[33:35] I wonder why this is just continuing and
[33:36] continuing and um he was just you know
[33:39] reminding me of all the promises and the
[33:40] word and everything and I was going yeah
[33:42] that that's right like it's it's all
[33:43] right it's there and then in the church
[33:45] on Sunday I was sitting at the back and
[33:47] um after the service and then when we
[33:49] were just worshiping just came onto my
[33:52] um it just came in my mind that
[33:54] scripture about how the um you know call
[33:57] the elders when they're sick they called
[33:58] the elders and anointed with oil and
[34:00] prayed for and I um and then straight
[34:03] away the reasoning comes in ah these are
[34:06] really sick people not just people who
[34:07] are tired and have a headache you see
[34:09] and then I just thought, "No way. Jesus
[34:11] took those stripes for me. No matter how
[34:13] big, no matter how small and I thought,
[34:15] no matter, no, I'm gonna if that's the
[34:17] scripture that's came." I thought, "No,
[34:18] I'm gonna like just go past the pride
[34:21] barrier. I'm going to go up and ask for
[34:22] prayer." And so I did. And then Monday
[34:25] comes, big headaches. Tuesday,
[34:27] Wednesday, headaches and headaches. And
[34:29] nothing changed immediately. But then
[34:31] because I knew at that time, oh my
[34:33] goodness
[34:35] me, just have the scarf, man. Um, yeah.
[34:39] So then I straight away here you take
[34:42] the
[34:44] baby. Okay. And stop.
[34:50] Okay. So then because I had that anchor,
[34:53] it was like something happened right
[34:54] then. I knew when I was anointed with
[34:56] oil, I thought that's the end of it. And
[34:57] I thought now I can take the devil back
[34:59] to that place. Anytime I get a headache,
[35:00] I thought I'm going to take him back
[35:01] there and say no way. I was healed right
[35:03] then. And um and then so then when all
[35:06] those headaches kept coming, you know,
[35:07] it was like Wednesday, Thursday, still
[35:10] big headache. And um and so I just I
[35:13] just kept saying to the devil, "No, no,
[35:15] I'm not having it. I'm not having I'm
[35:16] not having these headaches." And then
[35:18] and then the next the next day, gone.
[35:21] Just completely no headaches, not tired,
[35:24] just normal energy back and everything.
[35:25] So I just thank the Lord, he cares about
[35:27] the small things. Amen.
[35:31] Praise the mountain.
[35:38] family. Morning. Good to be in the house
[35:40] of the Lord. Um talking about the
[35:43] earthquakes and the opportunities we
[35:46] have and the ones that we don't. Um
[35:49] we're all thankful that we could be in
[35:50] our homes with our families at the time
[35:52] when it did strike. Um one thing that
[35:56] stood out for me is are we ready? Amen.
[35:59] Are we ready? The time is short. The
[36:02] time is now. Is our hearts in the right
[36:05] place? Is our families walking with us?
[36:08] What are we doing that's different? What
[36:10] are we doing that's right or wrong to
[36:13] ready ourselves for the coming of the
[36:15] Lord?
[36:16] Um, if he had to take us away on that
[36:19] Monday, Yeah. praise be to God. Because
[36:23] for myself, I know I've come a long way
[36:26] and
[36:27] there's no turning back. Yeah. But then
[36:30] when you think about your young ones and
[36:31] your family and you know all your
[36:33] extended family, lots of people are
[36:35] still left behind. So the shaking was a
[36:38] shakeup for us to prepare ourselves and
[36:40] to ready ourselves.
[36:43] Um so our opportunities are now while we
[36:47] all sit here as a family just to ponder
[36:50] on things that if we are not ready, if
[36:52] we are not right with the Lord, the
[36:56] opportunity is here. Make yourself right
[36:57] with the Lord. That's all right. Um I'm
[37:00] very thankful to my wife. Um my wife has
[37:03] been sharing with with the family from
[37:04] lower hut
[37:06] uh mongrel mob related and when they had
[37:11] the problems on Monday night my house
[37:13] was sanctuary. So I was thankful that we
[37:16] can open the doors for people that are
[37:18] not walking in the Lord but they could
[37:20] see the light and they know where to
[37:22] come. Thank you Lord. So, we used that
[37:25] opportunity to to to comfort them and to
[37:27] make them welcome and to to keep them at
[37:29] home and they went back home at about
[37:32] 6:00 that morning. I went back to work
[37:34] and on Tuesday with the with the floods,
[37:37] they were back there and with more
[37:40] people and and and you
[37:42] know, if people like that can see what
[37:46] the Lord has done for me and my family.
[37:48] Yeah. Right. They can see what the Lord
[37:50] has done for you and your family.
[37:51] Exactly. Right. So, thank you for being
[37:54] who you are. Thank you for being the
[37:55] lights in this place, in this dark
[37:57] place. All right. The Lord loves you.
[38:00] But rest assured, we need to prepare our
[38:02] hearts and be ready for the call. Amen.
[38:06] Thank you.
[38:18] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[38:29] Let's go
[38:31] to number
[38:33] 47. I'll see you in the
[38:35] rapture. Amen.

[38:47] again on this earth, my precious
[38:52] friend, if to God you have been
[38:58] through and above all
[39:03] sin, then for us there'll be a

[49:54] I'm
[49:57] going
[49:59] home. There is
[50:03] nothing
[50:05] holding me here.
[50:20] I
[50:23] behold. Praise
[50:26] God. I'm
[50:30] going
[50:35] home. I'm

[51:19] time, shall
[51:22] we? I'm

[51:31] going home.
[51:34] There is
[51:37] nothing
[51:39] holding me
[51:45] here. I've
[51:48] caught a
[51:51] glimpse of my
[51:54] heavenly
[51:56] home. Praise God.
[52:01] I'm
[52:03] going home.
[52:08] Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that
[52:09] assurance? It's not a hope so, it's a
[52:11] no.
[52:13] Hallelujah. Let's just bow our heads in
[52:15] a word of prayer, shall we? Gracious
[52:17] Father, oh, how we love you this
[52:19] morning, Lord. We just with great
[52:21] thanksgiving our hearts, we come into
[52:24] your presence one more time, Father, we
[52:26] just want to tell you that we love you
[52:27] to all our hearts, Lord. You're more
[52:29] than life to us. you more than our next
[52:30] breath. Lord, we're so glad Lord, this
[52:33] life is but a vapor, but our lives don't
[52:34] end when this life ends. But Father, we
[52:37] just Lord, we're we're just one breath
[52:39] from eternity. And Lord, we thank you
[52:41] that you paid all that we could step
[52:42] from this world into the next world.
[52:44] Lord, there's nothing holding us here.
[52:46] And it's all your doing, Lord, that
[52:48] we're free. It's not our doing, Lord.
[52:50] Man cannot do anything to help. They can
[52:52] try and reform themselves, but it's you
[52:54] that sets free. It's you that transforms
[52:56] by the power of your word, Lord. It's
[52:58] you that, Lord, makes us new creatures
[53:00] in Christ Jesus. We want to thank you
[53:02] for that, oh God. And Father, we just
[53:04] want to pray for Elizabeth, Lord, who's
[53:07] unwell. Father, go and touch her, Lord,
[53:09] as she's watching in now, Lord. May you
[53:11] just go through the internet, Lord.
[53:13] You're God everywhere, Lord. You're not
[53:14] God, just God in these four walls, Lord.
[53:17] Your word says you'd never leave us nor
[53:18] forsake us. We thank you for that great
[53:20] assurance. Lord, you said you'd be with
[53:22] us, even in us to the end of the world.
[53:24] And Lord, I just pray this whatever is
[53:25] causing her to be unwell. Lord, may it
[53:27] leave her in the name of Jesus Christ.
[53:29] We thank you by your stripes, she was
[53:30] healed. It's a finished work. All those
[53:33] who are sick here among us as well,
[53:34] Lord, as your word goes forth, may you
[53:36] bring healing as well. And Father, may
[53:38] your word find bedding ground in our
[53:40] hearts today. Lord, anoint it as it goes
[53:42] forth. Lord, anoint speaker and hear it
[53:44] one more time. Father, be with those who
[53:46] are away. And Lord, we just asking that
[53:49] you will just open your word to us.
[53:51] Lord, we know anyone can open the pages
[53:52] of your Bible, but you are the author.
[53:55] And Lord, we're not looking for
[53:57] someone's opinion, but we're looking for
[53:58] the author's declaration of your word.
[54:01] So, great heavenly author of your word.
[54:03] Lord, may you come and speak to us
[54:05] through it. We pray. Grant it. Father,
[54:07] may you receive all glory, honor, and
[54:09] praise in this service. We ask in Jesus
[54:11] Christ's name. Grant it, Lord. Amen.
[54:14] Amen. God bless you, friends. Good to
[54:16] have you all. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[54:20] This is your prayer, Brother Alistister.
[54:21] Amen. God bless you. Nice to see you
[54:23] here. Trust you feel at home. If you got
[54:25] your Bibles handy,
[54:27] everyone. Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[54:31] Amen. What a day to be alive. Amen.
[54:34] Let's just go to Joshua chapter 2.
[54:53] read from verse
[54:59] five. Actually, read from verse 15. I
[55:02] mean, sorry, from verse one down to
[55:07] verse, yeah, let's just read from verse
[55:09] one down to verse 15 of Joshua chapter
[55:11] 2. Who loves the Lord this morning?
[55:13] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[55:18] Joshua chapter 2:5. And it came to pass
[55:22] about the time of the shutting of the
[55:24] gate, when it was dark, that the men
[55:25] went out whether they went uh so this is
[55:28] Rahab speaking to the soldiers of the
[55:30] king of Jericho, looking for the two
[55:32] spies that have come into Jericho. And
[55:34] the woman took the two men and hid them,
[55:36] and said, "Thus, there came men unto me,
[55:38] and I was not from whence they were. And
[55:39] it came to pass about the time of the
[55:41] shutting of the gate, when it was dark,
[55:43] that the men went out where the men
[55:45] went. I what not? Pursue after them
[55:47] quickly, for ye shall overtake them. But
[55:50] she had brought them up to the roof of
[55:52] the house, and hid them with the stalks
[55:53] of flax, which she had laid an order
[55:56] upon the the roof. And the men pursued
[56:00] after them the way to Jordan unto the
[56:02] fords. And as soon as they um as soon as
[56:04] they which pursued after them had gone
[56:06] out, they shut the gate. And before they
[56:08] were laid down, she came up unto um came
[56:11] up unto them upon the roof. And she said
[56:14] unto the men, I know that the Lord hath
[56:16] given you the land, and that your terror
[56:18] has fallen upon us, and that all the
[56:20] inhabitants of land faint because of
[56:22] you. For we have heard how the Lord
[56:24] dried up the water of the Red Sea for
[56:26] you, when you came out of Egypt, and
[56:29] what ye did unto the two kings of the
[56:31] Amorites, which were on the other side
[56:33] of Jordan, Seahhorn and Og, which ye
[56:35] utterly destroyed. And as soon as ye we
[56:37] had heard these things, our hearts did
[56:39] melt. Neither did there remain any more
[56:41] courage in any man because of you. For
[56:43] the Lord your God, he is God in heaven
[56:45] above and earth beneath. Now therefore,
[56:47] I pray you swear unto me by the Lord,
[56:49] since I have showed you kindness, that
[56:51] ye will also show kindness under my
[56:54] father's house, and give me a true
[56:56] token, and that ye will save alive my
[56:59] father and my mother, and my brethren,
[57:00] my sisters, and all that they have, and
[57:02] deliver our lives from death. Glory. And
[57:05] the men answered her, "And our lives,
[57:06] our lives for yours, if ye are not this
[57:10] our business, and it shall be, when the
[57:13] Lord hath given us the land, that we
[57:15] will deal kindly truly with thee." Then
[57:18] she let them down of accord through the
[57:20] window, for her house was upon the town
[57:22] wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. And
[57:24] she said unto them, "Get ye to the
[57:26] mountains, least the pursuers meet you,
[57:28] and hide yourselves there three days
[57:30] until the pursuers be uh be returned."
[57:33] and afterwards may ye go your way. And
[57:36] the men said unto her, we will be
[57:38] blameless of this thine oath which thou
[57:40] hast made us swear. Behold, when we come
[57:42] into the land, thou shalt bind this line
[57:44] of scarlet thread in the window which
[57:47] thou didest let us which thou didest let
[57:49] us down by. And thou shalt bring thy
[57:52] father and thy mother and thy brethren,
[57:53] all thy father's household into um home
[57:55] unto thee. And it shall be that whoever
[57:58] shall go out of the doors of thy of thy
[58:00] house into the street, his blood shall
[58:01] be upon his head, and we will be
[58:03] guiltless. And whosoever shall be with
[58:05] thee in the house, his blood shall be
[58:07] upon uh our shall be on our head if any
[58:10] hand be upon him. Amen. May the Lord
[58:14] bless his word. You may you may be
[58:15] seated.
[58:24] Now, we live in very interesting days.
[58:28] As brother Arman basically stole my
[58:30] sermon, but he he quoted from Matthew
[58:32] chapter
[58:34] 24. The microphone's in my house now.
[58:36] You've moved it.
[58:39] You got to understand that God has a
[58:41] mind and God wants us not to look at
[58:43] physical things. As we've been going
[58:46] through these last few Sundays, we look
[58:47] at the things which are unseen, which
[58:49] are eternal, for the things which are
[58:50] seen are temporal. So we do not focus on
[58:53] the things we see because these things
[58:55] are going to fade away. We understand
[58:58] that even the world knows that the end
[59:00] is coming in some fashion. We they they
[59:03] see that World War II is is on its way.
[59:06] You know, there's wars and rumors of
[59:07] wars as as Jesus said there would be.
[59:10] And and it's, you know, we we read in
[59:12] Matthew 24 cuz we it says in verse one
[59:15] that when Jesus went out, he departed
[59:16] from the temple and his disciples came
[59:19] to him for to show him the buildings of
[59:21] the temple. And Jesus said unto them,
[59:23] "See ye not all these things? Verily I
[59:25] say unto you, there shall not be left
[59:27] one stone upon another that shall not be
[59:30] thrown down." And as he sat upon the
[59:32] Mount of Olives, his disciples came unto
[59:35] him privately, saying, Now they asked
[59:37] him three questions. tell us when shall
[59:40] these things be the destruction of the
[59:42] temple and what shall be the sign of thy
[59:44] coming and of the end of the world and
[59:47] then down through Matthew
[59:48] 24:25 down there he answers these three
[59:51] questions and part of his answer he says
[59:54] for nation shall rise against nation and
[59:56] kingdom against kingdom and there shall
[59:57] be famines and pestilence and
[59:59] earthquakes in diverse places and these
[1:00:02] are the beginnings of sorrows and we
[1:00:04] know diverse places means many places so
[1:00:06] we see the increase of the amount of
[1:00:09] earthquakes is part of the sign of the
[1:00:11] end.
[1:00:12] So we should not be surprised if this
[1:00:15] called the shaky isles begins to shake.
[1:00:18] Amen. Very very simple. But we should
[1:00:20] not be surprised when when we find
[1:00:23] ourselves maybe in the middle of a of a
[1:00:26] disaster. You know, as I put on the
[1:00:28] WhatsApp, you know, we were down in
[1:00:30] Christ Church during the first
[1:00:31] earthquake and this thing was nothing
[1:00:34] compared to that. I'm sure sister Margie
[1:00:35] can can can agree. This thing was a
[1:00:38] little tremor. It was really nothing.
[1:00:40] But I just want to relate that testimony
[1:00:42] to you again because you got to
[1:00:43] understand God is in in us. Amen. If
[1:00:47] you're a believer, it's not just this is
[1:00:49] not the power of positive thinking. You
[1:00:51] know, the power of positive thinking can
[1:00:53] reform a person, but it cannot transform
[1:00:55] a person. It cannot change your life. It
[1:00:57] cannot cause a person to forever live
[1:01:00] above the things that once bound them
[1:01:01] down. Amen. Amen. Just like myself, I
[1:01:03] was a I was an alcoholic for many years,
[1:01:05] but then Jesus set me free. And I've
[1:01:08] never had to say, "Help me another day."
[1:01:10] Amen. I do not believe it's man's good.
[1:01:13] You know, man tries to say, "Well, once
[1:01:15] a addict, always an addict." Cuz that's
[1:01:17] man trying to do the best they can. But
[1:01:20] God says, "Whom the son is set free is
[1:01:21] free indeed." And I am a living
[1:01:24] testimony of that. I don't struggle
[1:01:25] against alcoholism or or computer games
[1:01:28] or music or things that you know you
[1:01:30] know worldly music and all these
[1:01:31] different kinds of things. I've been set
[1:01:33] free. And if I've been set free, I don't
[1:01:35] have to try and hide myself in a cave
[1:01:37] that'll come and get me cuz I'm free.
[1:01:40] And so, but man is always worried about
[1:01:44] what might happen. And in Christ Church,
[1:01:46] it was 4:30 in the morning. For some
[1:01:48] reason, Christine and I were both awake.
[1:01:50] We lived in a little place in the and
[1:01:51] the bedroom was a near uh one-bedroom
[1:01:53] place. Mezzanine was above the rest of
[1:01:55] the apartment and it was like so we
[1:01:57] lived down a quiet street but it sounded
[1:02:00] like a freight train was coming through
[1:02:01] our living room and then we heard this
[1:02:03] sound and then the place violently
[1:02:05] started shaking. Not this gentle. It was
[1:02:07] violently shaking. And then so we ran
[1:02:09] somehow we got down the stairs to the
[1:02:11] front door. We begin to pray and when we
[1:02:13] were
[1:02:14] praying I wanted to keep my eyes open to
[1:02:16] see what was going to happen. I said,
[1:02:17] "No, I'm not going to look cuz that's
[1:02:19] not where my help comes from. My help
[1:02:21] comes from the Lord." So, I kept praying
[1:02:23] and the Haiti earthquake had just
[1:02:25] happened. And I heard testimonies from
[1:02:27] there about they were having some people
[1:02:29] having church and the place was shaking.
[1:02:31] The pastor said, "Just keep worshiping
[1:02:32] him." And the place fell down. And the
[1:02:35] testimony of how they the condition of
[1:02:36] the believers when they pulled out was
[1:02:38] not a scratch. And there was someone in
[1:02:41] a classroom in a concrete building. It
[1:02:42] begins to shake. You know, concrete
[1:02:44] concrete dust fills the place. He turns
[1:02:46] to his left. He sees a a a a light in
[1:02:49] the wall which was a hole. He stepped
[1:02:51] through that uh hole, went out the
[1:02:53] place, and the place collapsed. He was
[1:02:54] the only survivor. Wow. Amen. God looks
[1:02:58] after us. God looks and and if if we
[1:03:00] died as someone said, "Praise the Lord."
[1:03:02] Amen. Cuz this life is but a vapor. And
[1:03:05] so I was I was thanking God for these
[1:03:07] things and God came down. We had a
[1:03:08] glorious time. Amen. And even even we,
[1:03:11] you know, there was a there was a couple
[1:03:13] that uh a couple with young children
[1:03:15] that lived a block away. You know, Jeff
[1:03:17] and Jane Alfred. I'm sure many of you
[1:03:19] know them. You know, Jeff Jeff was with
[1:03:21] his dad over in the States, so it was
[1:03:24] just Jane alone with the kids at home.
[1:03:25] So, we thought, well, we better go see
[1:03:27] how they're doing. And and so we get
[1:03:30] dressed. You know, there was a uh
[1:03:32] someone's dish that we borrowed was the
[1:03:34] only thing that broke.
[1:03:36] Everything was fine. Now, it doesn't
[1:03:38] matter. Your place could be literally on
[1:03:40] fire, burnt down to the ground, or it
[1:03:42] could be totally fine. It does. It's
[1:03:44] really irrelevant. You know, you just
[1:03:45] praise God for it and praise God for the
[1:03:47] other. Obviously, I need a better house.
[1:03:49] Amen. Amen. God knows how to orchestrate
[1:03:51] things. He knows better than this. You
[1:03:53] can't lose being a Christian. You can't
[1:03:56] lose. That's what the prophet said. And
[1:03:58] I I absolutely agree. And so now, so we
[1:04:01] get all ready, open the front door, and
[1:04:03] we just live just above. We live there's
[1:04:05] Belev. South of that's the cathedral or
[1:04:07] the center of town. We lived just north
[1:04:09] of that. Every siren that there could be
[1:04:11] was going off and we thought, "What's
[1:04:14] going on?" And my immediate thought is,
[1:04:16] "Well, have I missed the rapture? What's
[1:04:17] going on?" And I
[1:04:22] um but then we we we all we had we
[1:04:24] didn't have smartphones in those days.
[1:04:25] That was the olden days. We had a dumb
[1:04:27] phone and we just had the all I had was
[1:04:29] a little torch on that. And there's all
[1:04:31] these people. Some are driving up to
[1:04:34] driving up to the port hills because
[1:04:36] there a tsunami apparently.
[1:04:38] running for their lives out the port
[1:04:39] hills. Heaps of people are standing
[1:04:41] there just in their pajamas just just
[1:04:43] standing
[1:04:44] there about 5:00 in the morning now.
[1:04:46] Have no idea what's going on. And here
[1:04:49] we are with my our little phones and all
[1:04:51] the place is cracked. There's all muddy
[1:04:53] water surge all over the place and we're
[1:04:55] trying to navigate through this to to to
[1:04:57] walk a block. It's you can't see
[1:04:58] anything. We have these, you know, our
[1:05:00] little torch lights. This this this
[1:05:02] thoughts on my mind. Now we now we're
[1:05:04] going to go see them. And then when I'm
[1:05:05] walking that way, the Lord says to me
[1:05:07] very clear. He said, "They which are
[1:05:09] alive and remain." You're alive and
[1:05:10] remain, don't you? 1 Thessalonians 4,
[1:05:12] they which are alive and remain shall
[1:05:14] not hinder or prevent those which are
[1:05:15] asleep, but the dead in Christ arise
[1:05:16] first. They which are alive and remain
[1:05:18] shall meet them, go with them to meet
[1:05:20] the Lord in the air. He says, "You're
[1:05:21] alive and remain." And I said, "Yes.
[1:05:23] Thank you, Lord." Amen. And we just kept
[1:05:25] walking on. We were fine. Were you
[1:05:27] scared? No. Yep. Not at all. Was I
[1:05:30] scared in this one? Not at all. My
[1:05:32] family was up in Taranga. God knows how
[1:05:34] to take care of things. I was by myself.
[1:05:37] And if you're scared, that's fine. But
[1:05:39] you got to understand, we don't look to
[1:05:40] things which you're seeing. Oh, is the
[1:05:42] building going to fall? What's going to
[1:05:43] happen? What should I do? You know, you
[1:05:45] should get to safety. Sure. But don't
[1:05:47] focus on yourself keeping yourself safe.
[1:05:50] It doesn't mean you stand there in the
[1:05:51] middle and and say, you know, where a
[1:05:53] place is going to fall. You know what I
[1:05:54] mean? But don't just don't just get so
[1:05:56] caught up in the these five senses
[1:05:58] because we're a supernatural people
[1:06:00] guided by a supernatural God. Exactly
[1:06:02] right. Amen. David would say in the
[1:06:05] Psalms, now so all of this is the
[1:06:07] beginning of sorrows. And I'd say we're
[1:06:09] not really at the beginning of sorrows.
[1:06:10] We're really near the end of where we're
[1:06:14] right there at the end of all things.
[1:06:16] Amen. And I'm not going to spend much
[1:06:18] time, but if you even read very simply,
[1:06:19] if you keep reading Matthew 24, Jesus
[1:06:21] would say when you see a fig when you
[1:06:23] see the fig tree put forth as buds and
[1:06:25] you read Jeremiah chapter 24, if you're
[1:06:27] taking notes very quickly, it says the
[1:06:29] figs in prophecy is Israel. Because here
[1:06:32] in Jeremiah 24, Jeremiah saw a vision of
[1:06:34] two baskets of figs. And one it says was
[1:06:38] the evil figs, bad figs, and one was
[1:06:39] good figs. All part of Israel. He said
[1:06:41] the good figs will go into captivity,
[1:06:43] then come back again. The evil ones will
[1:06:46] go be dispersed into the nations and
[1:06:47] will never return to the land. That's
[1:06:49] exactly what happens. So figs Yeah. And
[1:06:51] a tree in in the scripture is is a
[1:06:54] nation as well. King Nebuchadnezzar was
[1:06:55] seen as a great big tree. Amen. His
[1:06:58] kingdom. And so it says when you see the
[1:06:59] fig tree put forth this budge. You know
[1:07:01] summer is not even at the doors. So he's
[1:07:03] saying so what is that speaking? That
[1:07:04] the millennium is about to set in. And
[1:07:06] the fig tree in prophecy is Israel
[1:07:08] becoming a nation. And we you you look
[1:07:11] at world history for for the first time
[1:07:14] in about 2 and a half thousand years.
[1:07:15] Israel became a nation in 1948.
[1:07:18] And he said this generation will not
[1:07:20] pass until all be fulfilled. And many
[1:07:22] people take that scripture and say, "Oh,
[1:07:24] those people, you know, you know,
[1:07:26] Matthew got the got the prediction wrong
[1:07:28] because that generation that Jesus was
[1:07:30] speaking to, you know, we're still
[1:07:31] here." But they don't understand what
[1:07:33] the scripture says. This generation that
[1:07:35] sees Israel become a nation will not
[1:07:37] pass until all things be fulfilled. And
[1:07:40] how many years down the road are we?
[1:07:42] Amen. Amen. So there we are. So we're
[1:07:45] not at the beginning of the end, we're
[1:07:46] at the end of the end. Amen. But I just
[1:07:49] I just basically want to speak here very
[1:07:52] very quickly. I know time has already
[1:07:54] left us, but
[1:07:57] um
[1:07:58] Rahab, she lived on the fault line.
[1:08:02] I just want you to think about this. She
[1:08:04] didn't just live in the city. She lived
[1:08:06] on the wall. And that wall was going to
[1:08:08] fall down flat. And the wall did fall
[1:08:10] down flat if you continue to read it.
[1:08:12] But her house was there on top of the
[1:08:14] wall. Amen. But she had a sure token.
[1:08:18] She had a sure sign from God that
[1:08:20] everyone that came into her house would
[1:08:22] be safe. Amen. Amen. So friends, don't
[1:08:25] be afraid of a little shaking. You know,
[1:08:27] my mom sent me a text the other day. She
[1:08:29] says, "Don't you know that uh the fault
[1:08:32] line goes, you know, down lower hut?"
[1:08:34] And I send her back, "Mom, my
[1:08:36] understanding is lower hut is the fault
[1:08:37] line."
[1:08:39] Amen. That's true. I'm not worried.
[1:08:42] Rahab wasn't worried. That's it. Oh,
[1:08:45] should I move my house from the wall?
[1:08:47] Because they knew, she knew, as we just
[1:08:49] read, the whole city knew that Israel
[1:08:51] was going to take Jericho. They knew
[1:08:53] that their number, you know, the end of
[1:08:55] their way of life had coming to an end.
[1:08:58] But there's something about the seed of
[1:09:00] God, when they know judgment is about to
[1:09:02] strike, they cry out for mercy. Amen.
[1:09:04] And you see, Rahab, she she knew if
[1:09:07] there's a God of judgment coming, he is
[1:09:09] also a God of mercy. And because he
[1:09:11] heard exactly what God So God, oh, he
[1:09:14] poured out his wrath upon the Egyptians.
[1:09:16] That's just half the picture. He kept
[1:09:17] the Israelites safe. I mean, I think
[1:09:19] brother Ian said, you know, Gan wasn't
[1:09:21] affected by the plagues. You know, where
[1:09:23] where God's children were, they were
[1:09:25] safe as they could be. And they had
[1:09:27] received a token in Egypt of the blood
[1:09:29] that they put on the door and lentil of
[1:09:31] the house. It didn't matter how close
[1:09:32] the death angel came near them, it
[1:09:34] couldn't come into the house. It
[1:09:36] couldn't touch them. So, they were as
[1:09:37] safe as safe could be. So it was
[1:09:39] judgment to one, but it was it was mercy
[1:09:41] to the other. And even if you read about
[1:09:44] Pharaoh's heart being hardened, it
[1:09:46] wasn't actually God ultimately first
[1:09:48] that hardened his heart. But Pharaoh had
[1:09:50] to react to what Moses said. And he
[1:09:52] resisted what Moses said and it hardened
[1:09:54] his heart. And even if you read in the
[1:09:56] book of Acts, it says when Paul was
[1:09:58] preaching to the Jews that that it said
[1:10:01] it said that after he was speaking, it
[1:10:03] said and their hearts became hardened.
[1:10:05] The D, you know, they became hardened
[1:10:06] against the preaching of the word. And
[1:10:08] then he came to a place says low see
[1:10:10] yourself you find yourself unworthy of
[1:10:12] eternal life I turn to the Gentiles. So
[1:10:15] even you know it's actually a person's
[1:10:18] own free moral choice if they will
[1:10:20] receive mercy or they will receive
[1:10:22] judgment. Amen. So but Rahab knew that
[1:10:25] if if Israel could be safe that she
[1:10:28] could find safety as well even though
[1:10:30] she was not even the economy of God at
[1:10:32] the time. She was a gentile she was a
[1:10:34] harlot. Amen. She was she was not even
[1:10:36] welcome in any church poly no doubt in
[1:10:38] those days but she received a message
[1:10:41] from God and she said now if God can
[1:10:43] deliver them I'm sure he can find mercy
[1:10:45] for me and that's her first thing she
[1:10:47] asked for and not for herself only but
[1:10:50] for her family and they said just get
[1:10:52] them under this same token and they'll
[1:10:53] be fine. Amen. Hallelujah. It's the same
[1:10:55] thing with you and I brother Bram says
[1:10:57] now we know the token today is the Holy
[1:10:59] Spirit. Amen. It's not the, you know,
[1:11:01] it's not a piece of string or just a
[1:11:03] animal blood on a door and lentil. It is
[1:11:05] the Holy Ghost in you is the sure token
[1:11:08] that you've passed from death to life.
[1:11:11] Hallelujah. Because it says, "Repent
[1:11:13] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:11:15] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:11:16] of sin. And you shall receive the token.
[1:11:18] You shall receive the Holy Ghost."
[1:11:20] Because he says, "For the promise." Now,
[1:11:22] this is in Acts chapter 2, the first
[1:11:23] church service ever preached. And he
[1:11:25] says, and Peter gives the instruction.
[1:11:27] He says the promise is to you and those
[1:11:29] who are far off and as and to your
[1:11:31] children as many as the Lord our God
[1:11:33] shall call. So that same quickening
[1:11:36] power that was there in that that was
[1:11:38] there on the day of Pentecost is
[1:11:39] available to the believer today. We
[1:11:42] don't have to cotton but it or make it
[1:11:44] fluffy or make it whatever it is that
[1:11:46] same life that was released on Calvary
[1:11:49] that came upon them in the upper room is
[1:11:51] available today. And that same life is
[1:11:54] among us even now. you know, we were we
[1:11:56] were having some fellowship with brother
[1:11:58] Matthew, sister Naomi, driving driving
[1:12:00] uh you know, picking up from the airport
[1:12:02] and so on and we're talking about, you
[1:12:06] know, the church today. It's
[1:12:09] unfortunately it's either people have
[1:12:11] gone legal and says you must keep these
[1:12:14] laws, you must keep the word, this is
[1:12:15] how you be a Christian. And then but
[1:12:18] then the other half has gone
[1:12:20] liberal. Just just just keep keep living
[1:12:22] the same kind of life you are. And the
[1:12:25] reason that is is
[1:12:27] because there's no power. Now, this may
[1:12:31] say sound judgmental, but I'm just I
[1:12:32] trust you can just just give me a bit of
[1:12:34] grace
[1:12:35] today. There's no power in the word they
[1:12:38] preach to transform the people that they
[1:12:40] can live above sin, that they can live
[1:12:43] above their old life. Because if Paul
[1:12:45] says, "You're a new creature, a new
[1:12:46] creation in Christ," then therefore, how
[1:12:49] can I still be the old man? How can I
[1:12:51] still have the same desires that I used
[1:12:53] to have? How can I live the same kind of
[1:12:55] life if I'm a new creation? How can that
[1:12:58] be? The only reason can be is I'm not a
[1:13:00] new creation. I've just become
[1:13:01] religious. And unfortunately, it's it's
[1:13:04] it's always the same way. People can go
[1:13:07] liberal and they can be accepted or they
[1:13:09] can go legal and say you've got to
[1:13:10] conform to things. Both are wrong. Both
[1:13:13] of the just just two sides of the ditch
[1:13:15] on the road. Down the middle is God has
[1:13:18] a transforming power in his word. Amen.
[1:13:20] that transforms a person that they don't
[1:13:22] have to try and be a Christian. It is
[1:13:24] God in them being the Christian. We
[1:13:26] don't have to try and live good and try
[1:13:28] and produce something. There's a life
[1:13:30] that comes into the believer that
[1:13:31] produces the life of God. It is not you.
[1:13:34] Without me, Jesus says, "You can do
[1:13:36] nothing." And I say, "Thank you, Lord,
[1:13:38] cuz I know without him, I can do
[1:13:40] nothing." All it takes is a full
[1:13:42] surrender to him. And he'll be the
[1:13:43] Christian in you. Hallelujah. People
[1:13:45] say, "I want to get closer to God." Just
[1:13:46] just surrender your life. Amen. Say,
[1:13:48] "Lord, take me as I am and mold me and
[1:13:51] shape me into your image."
[1:13:53] Amen. So, it's not rules and
[1:13:55] regulations. It's not just being
[1:13:56] liberal. There's a power in the word.
[1:13:58] Cuz faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:14:00] the word of God. And when faith comes
[1:14:02] into the heart, it causes a person, the
[1:14:04] law of faith causes the people to live
[1:14:07] above their old life. Amen. Amen. That's
[1:14:10] why you've got to let faith in the word
[1:14:11] of God operate in your life. Thank you,
[1:14:13] Lord. Amen. Because the word will
[1:14:15] produce what it wants to produce. Amen.
[1:14:18] That's why it's never conforming. It's
[1:14:20] never I'm going to turn a new leaf. How
[1:14:21] many people turn a new leaf every New
[1:14:23] Year's just on January 1 or two? Oh,
[1:14:25] that didn't work out too well. If they
[1:14:27] have a real good, you know, if they're
[1:14:29] quite a diligent person and very, you
[1:14:31] know, have a have a strong will, maybe
[1:14:32] to the end of February,
[1:14:35] then they turn a leaf again. Why? It's
[1:14:37] the man is trying to reform itself. But
[1:14:40] if man is in a fallen condition, how can
[1:14:42] they reform themselves? That's why it
[1:14:44] takes God to come to lift us up to where
[1:14:47] we really should be, change our nature
[1:14:49] that he can come and live in us.
[1:14:51] Hallelujah. And then he is the
[1:14:53] Christian. It's not me. It's no longer I
[1:14:55] that liveth but Christ that liveth in
[1:14:57] me. That's what Paul said. Thank you,
[1:14:59] Lord. Amen. And that is not a nice just
[1:15:01] a nice phrase that has to become a
[1:15:03] reality. Amen. Now,
[1:15:06] David, David would uh you know, so
[1:15:11] um Rahab, she was living on the fault
[1:15:13] line, but she heard testimonies of what
[1:15:16] God did. She wasn't waiting to see what
[1:15:19] Joshua looked like and maybe how the
[1:15:21] church was and how the preaching was and
[1:15:22] all those kinds of things. She heard
[1:15:24] testimonies of a living God and she
[1:15:26] called out for mercy. And she was not
[1:15:29] afraid of what might happen when when
[1:15:32] Israel was going around because now she
[1:15:35] had something she had something tangible
[1:15:37] that she could now put into place. She
[1:15:40] had a sure token. Amen. Amen. And now
[1:15:44] it's amazing because I don't want to
[1:15:46] maybe I will jump ahead of myself but
[1:15:49] you know it's interesting when we live
[1:15:52] in this hour that we do and everyone is
[1:15:55] so caught up in international politics.
[1:16:01] You know, I just want to read, you know,
[1:16:03] brother Barham, he had seven seven, he
[1:16:05] says, seven major continuous visions in
[1:16:09] 1933. And the first one we know was
[1:16:11] Mussolini would invade Ethiopia. And he
[1:16:14] and and and he would he would conquer
[1:16:15] the country, but then he would
[1:16:17] ultimately die a shameful death. And we
[1:16:20] see that the next year 1934 is when
[1:16:23] Mussolini invaded Ethiopia. And you see
[1:16:26] photos when he has killed him and his
[1:16:27] mistress are hung, their bodies hung
[1:16:29] upside down in the public square. and
[1:16:30] they spat on all kinds of things. He
[1:16:32] came to a ruinous end. And then he had
[1:16:34] the then he had the vision of of an
[1:16:37] Austrian by the name of Adolf Hitler
[1:16:38] would rise as dictator over Germany and
[1:16:40] he would draw the world into war and
[1:16:43] also show the sigfred line and how our
[1:16:45] troops would have a terrible time to
[1:16:47] overcome it and then it would show that
[1:16:49] Hitler would come to a mysterious end.
[1:16:51] Now, Hitler, if you look at his rise to
[1:16:53] power, he came to power in in 33, but it
[1:16:57] was only in 1934 when when the fullness
[1:17:00] of his dictatorship really came into
[1:17:02] being cuz he had to deal with the
[1:17:03] chancellor or something like that. So,
[1:17:04] you go read
[1:17:06] that. And then the third vision was that
[1:17:09] there'd be three great isms, fascism,
[1:17:13] Nazism, and communism. And that the
[1:17:16] first two would be swallowed up in the
[1:17:17] third. And then the voice of Monus,
[1:17:19] watch Russia. Watch Russia. Keep your
[1:17:22] eye on the king of the north. Now notice
[1:17:23] it didn't say, "Watch the Soviet Union."
[1:17:26] It says, "Watch Russia." In 1933, there
[1:17:28] was a Soviet Union. And then when when
[1:17:30] when the prophet was preaching, the
[1:17:32] Soviet Union was at its apex. And
[1:17:33] they're all worried about nuclear war
[1:17:35] happening. There's a Cuban missile
[1:17:37] crisis going on. All these different
[1:17:38] things. The world was shaking in that
[1:17:40] way. But it said, "Watch Russia, not
[1:17:42] watch the Soviet Union."
[1:17:44] And we see that Russia is coming to its
[1:17:47] position even now. Amen. Amen. And then
[1:17:51] the fourth vision when its great
[1:17:52] advances in science after the Second
[1:17:54] World War and it was headed up in a
[1:17:56] vision of a of a egg-shaped plastic
[1:17:59] bubble car running down beautiful
[1:18:01] highways and the people just playing
[1:18:03] games, not even driving the thing. Here
[1:18:05] we are. Amen.
[1:18:09] And then the fifth vision was the moral
[1:18:11] problem of the age and the moral decay
[1:18:13] of the
[1:18:14] age. And then the sixth vision was an um
[1:18:18] in America. It says a most beautiful but
[1:18:20] cruel woman. She held the people in her
[1:18:22] complete power. I believed that this was
[1:18:25] the rise of the Catholic Church. Though
[1:18:27] I knew it could possibly be a vision of
[1:18:29] some woman rising in great power in
[1:18:31] America due to the popular popular vote
[1:18:33] by women. Now,
[1:18:37] Catholicism came from the pope once upon
[1:18:40] a time was not allowed in the White
[1:18:41] House. When Kennedy came in, the
[1:18:43] Catholics came in and it changed the
[1:18:45] whole thing. Then you have Pope Francis
[1:18:46] addressing the whole joint session of
[1:18:48] the Congress and House of
[1:18:50] Representatives.
[1:18:52] So the whole now, but this last and
[1:18:54] seventh vision was I heard a terrible
[1:18:58] explosion and as I turned to look I saw
[1:19:00] nothing but debris craters and smoke all
[1:19:02] over the land of America. So that was
[1:19:04] the end of it was America is
[1:19:07] done.
[1:19:09] Okay. Now people are looking and people
[1:19:13] are very excited about I'm just I I'm
[1:19:17] going political for a second but I just
[1:19:18] want you to keep don't even pay
[1:19:20] attention to it. People are saying oh
[1:19:22] Donald Trump is the last Trump which
[1:19:24] will introduce you know all kinds of
[1:19:27] things and he's a trumpeter of
[1:19:28] revelation all these things. All it is
[1:19:30] is evangelical Christians being caught
[1:19:33] up under a political spirit trying to
[1:19:36] revive the state of the nation. They're
[1:19:39] excited about reviving the grandeur of
[1:19:41] America. That's right. But Christians,
[1:19:44] we love our country, but the success of
[1:19:47] our country is not ultimately what makes
[1:19:49] us have a revival. But they're having a
[1:19:52] church revival because they voted and
[1:19:54] and and Trump got in and praise the Lord
[1:19:56] and the antichrist they called didn't
[1:19:58] get in and whatever more. You know, all
[1:19:59] these things that they say politics is
[1:20:01] rotten both sides. Amen. But people get
[1:20:04] so caught up. Oh, this is going to bring
[1:20:05] to pass all these things. All I know is
[1:20:09] that if a prophet has prophesied things
[1:20:12] and six things have already come into
[1:20:14] being. Amen. And the seventh is America
[1:20:16] be smoke bombs and craters and debris.
[1:20:19] That's right. Then everything that's
[1:20:20] happening now is leading towards that
[1:20:22] end point. Amen. Everything you see in
[1:20:25] world news is coming to that end point.
[1:20:27] But brother Bram told us before the
[1:20:29] first bomb drops, the bride is gone.
[1:20:32] Amen. So I say these things is that
[1:20:34] don't get caught up in all Trump and
[1:20:36] he's the trumpet of revelation all these
[1:20:38] different things. It's just a political
[1:20:40] excitement because they want to revive
[1:20:43] the the nation.
[1:20:46] That's not that's not a real revival. A
[1:20:48] real revival when God opens his word to
[1:20:50] you. Amen. When God quickens his word to
[1:20:53] you and God becomes alive to you. Amen.
[1:20:56] Just like the Welsh revival, you know,
[1:20:58] that was before was it 1901 before Isuza
[1:21:00] Street, people came from America. They
[1:21:02] came to Wales and they and they got off
[1:21:04] the boat and they were looking around.
[1:21:06] They saw a policeman swinging his his
[1:21:09] stick and looking all happy and all
[1:21:10] these things. And they asked him, "Sir,
[1:21:12] where's the Welsh revival?" He says,
[1:21:14] "You found it. It's in me." Amen.
[1:21:17] Hallelujah. It's got to be the same
[1:21:19] thing. The bride's revival is in the
[1:21:21] bride. That's right. Amen.
[1:21:24] When you see the spiritual church lining
[1:21:27] up, amen, with Jesus Christ and walking
[1:21:29] in harmony with him, Amen. then you know
[1:21:31] something's really going on. And you've
[1:21:33] got to understand we're living in that
[1:21:35] season. So don't look at don't look at
[1:21:37] what may you know, oh nuclear war and
[1:21:40] what Putin's doing and what all these
[1:21:41] things. Don't worry about all that
[1:21:43] stuff. Our focus is on the Lord Jesus
[1:21:45] Christ. Our focus is on his word and our
[1:21:48] walk with him because he has come in
[1:21:50] this hour to prepare a people to leave
[1:21:52] this world to go from this world to the
[1:21:54] next world. Amen. That is that is his
[1:21:56] focus upon you know upon the world is
[1:21:59] his bride. And whosoever will let them
[1:22:01] come.
[1:22:03] You you read the book of Genesis you
[1:22:05] know there's 25 year chronicle of of of
[1:22:08] God dealing with Abraham. There's
[1:22:10] nations rise there's great conflicts
[1:22:13] going on. There's civilizations. There's
[1:22:15] inventions going on. It's not
[1:22:18] recorded. Why? It doesn't. God doesn't
[1:22:21] worry about it. His focus was I'm
[1:22:23] walking with my son. Amen. He's going to
[1:22:25] be the father of the faith. I'm going to
[1:22:27] reveal myself to him like no one else up
[1:22:30] to this point. Amen. He's going to know
[1:22:32] me as strength giver. He's going to know
[1:22:33] me as lifegiver. Amen. Amen. He's going
[1:22:36] to know me, you know, as Malchazdc.
[1:22:38] Amen. Giving part of myself in the
[1:22:39] communion as a foraste. Amen. I'm going
[1:22:42] to change his bodies so him and Sarah
[1:22:43] can become young again and have the
[1:22:45] promised son. You say, "How could they
[1:22:47] come young again?" They go down into
[1:22:49] Egypt. They're old now. They're older
[1:22:51] than everyone here. And Abraham, before
[1:22:54] they maybe get to customs, says,
[1:22:57] "Zarah, you're real beautiful.
[1:23:00] Tell them that you're my sister so they
[1:23:03] won't kill me." Yeah, that's right. Go
[1:23:06] read it in the scripture. Amen. Here's
[1:23:08] old grandma, 80 odd years old. You're
[1:23:11] beautiful. The king will want you to be
[1:23:13] married. What? Marry
[1:23:16] grandma? What? A king marries a takes a
[1:23:20] queen to have a son to succeed him.
[1:23:23] That's right. You can't marry grandma to
[1:23:24] have a son to succeed you. That's right.
[1:23:27] Um, pretty sure that's kind of
[1:23:28] straightforward. So, how could the king
[1:23:31] or everyone want to kill Abraham to get
[1:23:33] his wife if she's no grandma still?
[1:23:36] What's happened? They were turned young
[1:23:37] again. You got to read between the lines
[1:23:39] of the scripture. doesn't take you out
[1:23:41] of the story. It's all in there. Amen.
[1:23:45] And so God revealing himself came
[1:23:47] different ways to Abraham and that was
[1:23:50] God's focus in that age. How much more
[1:23:53] today? You look at you look at Israel's
[1:23:55] in the wilderness. 40 years. A lot of
[1:23:58] things happen in 40 years. Nations rise,
[1:24:01] monuments are built, temples are built,
[1:24:04] pyramids are built. All these things are
[1:24:06] going
[1:24:07] on. It's not recorded in those 40 years.
[1:24:10] Why? God is with his children. Amen.
[1:24:12] Guiding you around the mountain.
[1:24:14] Revealing myself. Dealing with them.
[1:24:17] Amen. What about today? Oh, look what's
[1:24:20] happening in the world. What is God
[1:24:22] doing with you?
[1:24:24] Amen. Don't get engrossed. Hey, sure.
[1:24:26] Watch the news. Read the news. It's
[1:24:28] fine. But don't get engrossed by it.
[1:24:30] Don't get caught up by it. You should be
[1:24:32] caught up with one thing. Exactly. He is
[1:24:36] his word, is he not? You should be
[1:24:37] caught up with a relationship. You say,
[1:24:39] "I don't know, Lord, how to really walk
[1:24:41] with you." Well, seek a relationship in
[1:24:43] his word. Seek him in his word
[1:24:45] prayerfully, and he'll reveal himself
[1:24:47] out of his word to you. Amen. Because
[1:24:50] Jesus is the word. He's not a figure of
[1:24:53] our imagination, a man who just walked
[1:24:55] on Galilee, shores of Galilee, and and
[1:24:58] only. But he's the same yesterday,
[1:25:00] today, and forever. He's the present God
[1:25:03] and he is his word.
[1:25:07] Amen.
[1:25:08] So now, as I said, don't get caught up
[1:25:10] with all this Trump trumpet stuff.
[1:25:13] There's one thing that's going to
[1:25:14] happen. The that that nation is going to
[1:25:16] be smoke bombs and craters.
[1:25:18] And that everything that's happening now
[1:25:20] is leading to that point.
[1:25:23] Amen. So, let's not get worried about
[1:25:25] those things. I'll take off my political
[1:25:27] hat for a second.
[1:25:29] Now,
[1:25:31] David, David went through a lot of
[1:25:33] trouble in his
[1:25:34] life, but he had a revelation. He said
[1:25:38] it a few times. God is my rock. In him I
[1:25:41] will I trust. He is my shield and the
[1:25:42] horn of my salvation, my high tower, my
[1:25:45] refuge, my savior. Thou saveth me from
[1:25:48] violence. And he'd say in Psalms 18:2,
[1:25:50] "The Lord is my rock and my fortress and
[1:25:52] my deliverer. My God, my strength in
[1:25:54] whom I'll trust, my buckler and the horn
[1:25:56] of my salvation and my high tower."
[1:25:59] Psalms 62 and 7. In God is my salvation
[1:26:02] and my glory. The rock of my strength
[1:26:04] and my refuge is in God. Psalms 94:22.
[1:26:07] But the Lord is my defense and my God is
[1:26:10] the rock of my refuge. And that sounds
[1:26:13] all very nice, but I just want to hone
[1:26:14] it down a little bit because Jesus in
[1:26:17] Matthew 16, he he takes his disciples
[1:26:20] aside and he's wanting them to really he
[1:26:23] he's wanting a response from them about
[1:26:27] who he really is. What has been revealed
[1:26:29] to them? They've seen a lot of
[1:26:31] incredible things. They've seen, you
[1:26:33] know, they've seen miracle after
[1:26:35] miracle. No man has spoken like this
[1:26:37] man. But he wants them to
[1:26:40] respond, "What have you seen in me?" Cuz
[1:26:44] the scripture tells us he looked like
[1:26:46] any other man. When we see him, it says
[1:26:48] in Isaiah 53, there's nothing of him
[1:26:50] that we desire him. So he wasn't like
[1:26:53] Christianity today. They, you know,
[1:26:54] they, all the drawings and things, he's
[1:26:56] 6' tall, blonde hair, pure white robes.
[1:27:00] Everyone else doesn't look like that at
[1:27:01] all, you know, around him. That's not
[1:27:04] how he was. He looked like any other
[1:27:05] man.
[1:27:08] And so here was a here was this man and
[1:27:11] they and so he asked them he says who do
[1:27:13] men say that I the son of man and they
[1:27:16] would say some say you are John the
[1:27:18] Baptist Elias or Jeremas or one of the
[1:27:20] prophets because they could see the
[1:27:21] prophets manifested in him because all
[1:27:23] the prophets was a a portion of God
[1:27:26] being poured out. You see Moses
[1:27:28] lawgiver, you know, that was a portion.
[1:27:30] Remember Jesus, Jesus was the lawgiver
[1:27:33] that came, you know, God, I'll say this,
[1:27:35] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus
[1:27:37] Christ of the New. Amen. Amen. And so
[1:27:40] now, the law was given on on Mount Si
[1:27:44] and Moses, you know, that was a part of
[1:27:46] God come down as lawgiver and then down
[1:27:49] through the Old Testament, it was a
[1:27:50] portion of God being poured out. But
[1:27:52] then when he be God himself became
[1:27:54] flesh, it says the fullness of the
[1:27:56] Godhead bodily was in him. In Colossians
[1:27:58] 2, I think nine. And so all that God was
[1:28:02] now was in in one man. The fullness of
[1:28:04] the Godhead was in him. And so that's
[1:28:07] why they could see Elijah or John the
[1:28:09] Baptist or Jeremiah, one of the prophets
[1:28:11] in the ministry of Jesus Christ. But
[1:28:14] then he asked them, "But who do you say
[1:28:16] I am?" So he's not he's really not that
[1:28:19] interested in what they say. He's asking
[1:28:21] his disciples, "Who do you say I am?"
[1:28:23] Yeah. "Who am I to you?"
[1:28:27] And Peter says those words, "Thou art
[1:28:29] the Christ, the son of the living God."
[1:28:32] Yeah. And Jesus says, "Blessed art thou,
[1:28:34] Simon, son of Jonas, Bar Jonah, for
[1:28:37] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:28:39] you, but my father in heaven, and upon
[1:28:42] this rock will I build my church, and
[1:28:45] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:28:46] against it." What is the subject matter?
[1:28:49] What has been revealed?
[1:28:51] What is the revelation that you have
[1:28:52] received of who I am? What's been
[1:28:55] revealed to the people? Are you one of
[1:28:56] the prophets? But who do you say I am?
[1:28:58] What's been revealed to you? You're the
[1:29:00] Christ, the son of living God. Bless
[1:29:02] you, Simon Bar Jonah. For flesh and
[1:29:04] blood has not revealed this to you, but
[1:29:05] my father in heaven. So, it's the
[1:29:07] revelation. The revelation of who he is
[1:29:09] is what the church is built upon. Amen.
[1:29:12] The revelation of who he is. And this is
[1:29:16] our rock. Amen. Amen. Amen. God is my
[1:29:20] rock. Amen. Because he has revealed
[1:29:22] himself to me and I know who he is.
[1:29:25] Amen. And the same question is posed to
[1:29:27] you. Who do you say Jesus is? Amen. Is
[1:29:31] he just the man who walked Galilee and
[1:29:33] is coming again someday? Or is he the
[1:29:36] same yesterday, today, and forever? Is
[1:29:38] he the living God that's among us? Is he
[1:29:40] his word revealed? Amen. Who do you say
[1:29:43] he is? Amen.
[1:29:45] Because if you just make him a
[1:29:47] historical god, you're not built upon
[1:29:50] the rock. Amen. That's right. Oh, he did
[1:29:52] these things yesterday. Yeah, but you
[1:29:54] know, I don't know really what he's
[1:29:56] doing today. He's not personal to me. He
[1:29:59] has to become personal to you. He has to
[1:30:01] become your rock. And David had that
[1:30:03] revelation. And David went through a lot
[1:30:05] of hardships in his life, but he had the
[1:30:07] revelation, God is my rock. Amen.
[1:30:10] Hallelujah. And I trust that he is your
[1:30:12] rock this morning. That doesn't matter
[1:30:14] if if if the epicenter of the next
[1:30:16] earthquake is right under our feet.
[1:30:18] You'll be as confident as confident can
[1:30:20] be. God is my rock. And whatever happens
[1:30:23] to me, it's up to God. And whatever
[1:30:25] doesn't happen to me, praise the Lord.
[1:30:27] It doesn't matter what happens. If I
[1:30:29] die, I win cuz I'm in Christ. I trust
[1:30:31] you are. And if I live, well, God still
[1:30:33] has a purpose for me. Amen. Amen. We are
[1:30:36] here for a purpose. And nothing can take
[1:30:39] us from this life until our purpose is
[1:30:41] done. Amen. Amen. That's right. Amen.
[1:30:43] You got to have confidence in him.
[1:30:47] God is my rock. God became Rahab's rock.
[1:30:51] Rahab wasn't worried what's going to
[1:30:53] happen to her
[1:30:54] house. Now,
[1:30:57] grace grace in the um grace in the Old
[1:31:00] Testament, in the
[1:31:02] New. It's very interesting. There's a
[1:31:06] change because there's a promise that's
[1:31:09] in Ezekiel.
[1:31:11] that God will write his word in the
[1:31:14] hearts of the people. Wait, let's just
[1:31:17] read that. Let's go to Ezekiel 36.
[1:31:22] I just want to read this.
[1:31:35] So, 26
[1:31:50] and oh no 36 sorry need to turn a page
[1:31:54] 3625 so there's a promise now in the Old
[1:31:58] Testament if you go look you look at all
[1:32:01] the definitions of the word
[1:32:03] grace in the Old Testament it's to
[1:32:05] properly to bend or stoop in kindness to
[1:32:08] an inferior. So, it's a stooping down to
[1:32:11] help someone that's lower. That's what
[1:32:13] grace is in the Old Testament. But in
[1:32:15] the New It It is that, but it has a
[1:32:18] greater meaning. Because we have this
[1:32:20] promise. Now, I want you to notice now
[1:32:23] all the times God says
[1:32:25] I. It's not you, it is I. Okay?
[1:32:32] Then will I sprinkle clean water upon
[1:32:34] you, and you shall be clean. From all
[1:32:37] your filthiness, and from your idols
[1:32:38] will I cleanse you. And a new heart also
[1:32:41] will I give you. And a new spirit will I
[1:32:45] put within you. And I will take away the
[1:32:48] stony heart out of your flesh. And I'll
[1:32:50] give I will give you a heart of flesh.
[1:32:52] And I will put my spirit within you and
[1:32:56] cause you to walk in my statutes. And
[1:32:57] you shall keep my judgments and will do
[1:33:00] them. So there's a promise
[1:33:03] of the New Testament because it had to
[1:33:05] happen yet because the blood of bulls
[1:33:07] and goats could never change the
[1:33:08] worshipper. That's right. Amen. The
[1:33:10] blood of bulls and goats was not the
[1:33:12] same life as as human life because
[1:33:14] humans have souls. Animals do not have
[1:33:16] souls. Well, why is that? You go back to
[1:33:19] Jesus's day and the chimpanzees in
[1:33:21] Jesus' day are the same chimpanzees
[1:33:23] today. They forage the same way. They
[1:33:25] build the same things. They they their
[1:33:27] whole life pattern is the same. But then
[1:33:29] you go to the people in Jesus's day,
[1:33:31] they had they had, you know, donkeys,
[1:33:34] they had boats, you know, they're living
[1:33:36] just in the Iron Age, basically. And
[1:33:38] then you come to people today and I'm
[1:33:40] anywhere in the world.
[1:33:43] Amen. I can go to I can go to the moon.
[1:33:47] Amen. I don't I don't just mean
[1:33:49] figuratively. Literally, man has gone to
[1:33:50] the moon. Amen. I can I can jump on a
[1:33:54] plane and I can fly somewhere. You know
[1:33:56] what's happened? Cuz man has a soul. is
[1:33:58] trying to em better himself. He's
[1:33:59] different to animal life.
[1:34:03] And
[1:34:04] so, so now
[1:34:06] grace in the so notice he says I will do
[1:34:11] this. Now grace in the New Testament now
[1:34:14] the first time the word is mentioned is
[1:34:16] Luke 2 and 40. And the child grew and
[1:34:19] wax strong in spirit filled with wisdom
[1:34:21] and the grace of God was upon him. Now
[1:34:24] this word
[1:34:26] grace it's graciousness just like uh
[1:34:30] similar to the old
[1:34:31] testament but the meaning is different.
[1:34:34] It means of manner or
[1:34:37] act. It means um figurative or spirit um
[1:34:41] a spiritual but it says especially the
[1:34:44] divine influence upon the heart and its
[1:34:47] reflection in the life. That is what the
[1:34:50] word grace means. It means a divine
[1:34:52] influence upon the heart and its
[1:34:55] reflection in the life. It's not the
[1:34:58] same as the Old Testament. Why? Because
[1:35:00] they were under the blood of bulls and
[1:35:01] goats in the Old Testament and the life
[1:35:03] that was shed on their behalf could not
[1:35:05] change them. So if they if they brought
[1:35:09] an animal for a sin they did, the desire
[1:35:12] they had to do that sin was still in
[1:35:13] them after they gave the animal. But
[1:35:15] they were justified in the sight of God.
[1:35:17] Yeah, but they were still the same when
[1:35:20] they left, you know, they didn't change.
[1:35:23] But now under the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:35:25] now by faith, when you receive what he
[1:35:28] has done for you, Amen. He changes your
[1:35:31] nature that the things that brought you
[1:35:33] to under condemnation to begin with, you
[1:35:36] don't leave with them. Hallelujah. And
[1:35:39] so that's why grace now is a divine
[1:35:42] influence upon your heart and it's a
[1:35:44] reflection in the life. So when grace
[1:35:46] comes upon you, there's a divine
[1:35:49] influence comes into your life. Amen.
[1:35:51] Amen. That causes you to live above this
[1:35:54] world. And that's why he says, "And
[1:35:56] after he has cleansed you up and given
[1:35:58] you a new heart, a new spirit," he says,
[1:36:00] "And I will put my spirit within you and
[1:36:03] cause you to walk in my statutes, and
[1:36:05] you shall keep my judgments and do
[1:36:07] them." Why? Because there's a divine
[1:36:09] influence has become upon my life. Grace
[1:36:12] is not God just winking at the things we
[1:36:14] do and you can just stay as you were.
[1:36:16] Jesus always said, "Go and sin no more.
[1:36:18] Least a worse thing come upon you."
[1:36:20] Amen. And so real grace is when the when
[1:36:23] God comes upon you and it changes
[1:36:26] there's a there's a change in the
[1:36:27] influence in your life. There's a new
[1:36:29] life has come in and that is reflected
[1:36:32] in the life that you live.
[1:36:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Now Rahab, I'm just
[1:36:38] going to maybe just settle on this for a
[1:36:39] while, but Rahab, I could say a divine
[1:36:42] influence came upon her. Remember Rahab
[1:36:45] is a shadow of you. Amen. We live on a
[1:36:48] fault line. This whole world is shaking.
[1:36:50] Amen. There's no We know we sing the
[1:36:53] song, but there is no sure place to
[1:36:54] stand. Doesn't matter if you move to
[1:36:56] America. Doesn't matter what continent
[1:36:59] you go to, there's strife, there's war,
[1:37:02] you know, there's polarization of of of
[1:37:05] ideologies, you know, all these
[1:37:07] different kinds of things going
[1:37:09] on. You know, this world is falling
[1:37:11] apart. America, you know, America is
[1:37:13] bankrupt. Yes. And they just raised the
[1:37:16] debt ceiling. Oh, let's just raise the
[1:37:18] debt ceiling. Let's just raise the debt
[1:37:19] ceiling. The whole thing's broken.
[1:37:24] This world is broken.
[1:37:26] And I'm not saying that to scare you,
[1:37:28] but you got to recognize the only You
[1:37:30] could be anywhere in the world, but if
[1:37:31] you're not in Christ, you know, you're
[1:37:33] on shaking sand. That's right. But if
[1:37:35] you're in him, you could be living You
[1:37:38] could be living in the middle of
[1:37:39] Damascus.
[1:37:40] Amen. You could be living in whatever
[1:37:43] war zone and you'd be safe as safe could
[1:37:45] be. I'm not necessarily talking
[1:37:46] physically safe. I'm talking what is
[1:37:48] real safety. Amen. Amen. This thing, if
[1:37:52] the if the world goes on, is going to be
[1:37:54] in the grave. Yes. If time goes on, this
[1:37:56] thing's going to be six foot under
[1:37:57] someplace. Someone's going to bury me
[1:37:58] and say some probably nice words and
[1:38:00] throw some flowers on the casket and
[1:38:02] bury it and done.
[1:38:06] But what about your soul? Amen. That's
[1:38:10] right. What about the real you? Yes. And
[1:38:12] so Rahab, she acted. Now remember, she
[1:38:16] was a harlot. She had a bad name to
[1:38:19] begin with. No doubt. No doubt in
[1:38:22] Jericho because remember how they part
[1:38:24] of their religion was part of their
[1:38:26] warfare in those days. They'd have
[1:38:29] religious ceremony and they ask their
[1:38:31] gods to bless their troops that they'd
[1:38:33] be successful. Then they'd go into
[1:38:34] battle. So no doubt their churches would
[1:38:36] have been full. Their temples would have
[1:38:39] been full. They would have been offering
[1:38:40] sacrifices, doing all kinds of things,
[1:38:42] you know, that that they would defeat
[1:38:44] these Israelites.
[1:38:46] So there would have been a great
[1:38:47] religious fervor going on in Jericho.
[1:38:51] But here was Rahab, and once upon a time
[1:38:54] her house was a den of prostitution
[1:38:56] because she was a harlot. But now she
[1:38:58] turned it into a haven of rest.
[1:39:00] Hallelujah. Amen. She turned it into a
[1:39:03] place of safety. Amen. Because a divine
[1:39:06] influence came upon her life and she
[1:39:08] knew if God could deliver Israel out of
[1:39:11] Egypt, they can deliver whosoever comes
[1:39:13] into my house. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:39:16] And so now, friends, I trust that you I
[1:39:20] know time has slipped away, but I trust
[1:39:24] you're in the same manner. It doesn't
[1:39:26] matter where you live. Remember, if we
[1:39:29] won't read it, but at the same time, go
[1:39:30] read Joshua. First part of Joshua, it
[1:39:33] says the walls fell down flat. Amen. And
[1:39:37] Israel went in and took the land. You
[1:39:39] know, took the city. Where was her
[1:39:41] house? On the top of the wall. Amen.
[1:39:44] What happened to her house when it fell
[1:39:45] down flat? It was still intact. Amen.
[1:39:48] That's right. Amen. After the whole
[1:39:50] thing fell. Hallelujah. And that was
[1:39:52] under the blood of bulls and goats.
[1:39:55] Amen. That was under the blood of bulls
[1:39:56] and goats. That was Old Testament. That
[1:39:57] wasn't even New Testament. That's just a
[1:40:00] shadow of what you enjoy now, what you
[1:40:02] have now. Amen. So, her house fell down
[1:40:04] flat. I mean, you know, the wall fell
[1:40:06] down flat. Her house was now on ground
[1:40:07] level and they're all safe. They're all
[1:40:10] well. They had all their possessions.
[1:40:12] Nothing was lost. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:14] Amen. And it's the same thing. You have
[1:40:16] to remember, I think I think brother
[1:40:17] Kuba said, life and death is in the
[1:40:20] power of the tongue. And you have the
[1:40:22] ability to create an atmosphere around
[1:40:24] you. You can create an atmosphere of
[1:40:26] doubt and unbelief and fear just by the
[1:40:29] word you speak. And you must understand
[1:40:32] if you are the bride of Christ, you have
[1:40:34] the power of the spoken word in you that
[1:40:36] you can create an atmosphere or change
[1:40:38] the whole course of events by the way
[1:40:40] you speak. Amen. There's a, you know,
[1:40:43] there's one, I know it's a phys, I mean,
[1:40:45] a natural thing, but, you know, uh,
[1:40:48] there's a church in Louisiana, Brother
[1:40:49] Tim Puit's church, and they're doing
[1:40:51] mission work into Japan. And there was a
[1:40:55] there was one of the brothers who was
[1:40:56] going on the mission work. He he met a a
[1:41:00] um a man he had never met before on a
[1:41:02] job. And this other guy was a Christian
[1:41:04] as well. And he's saying, "We're going
[1:41:05] to go to Japan and we want to share the
[1:41:07] gospel." And so this guy who had never
[1:41:09] met before never met before says, "I
[1:41:11] want to I want to donate to to help you
[1:41:14] go." And then so it says, "I'll I'll
[1:41:17] write you out a check and I'll and I'll
[1:41:19] send it to you." Then so the next day,
[1:41:21] you know, this brother goes talk to
[1:41:23] brother Tim and says, "Well, you know,
[1:41:25] maybe he'll just give like $500. You
[1:41:27] know, he won't really give a whole
[1:41:28] bunch." Brother Tim says, "No, he's
[1:41:31] going to pay for your tickets and he's
[1:41:32] going to give this church $10,000
[1:41:34] towards the mission work." And that's
[1:41:36] exactly what happened. And then they
[1:41:38] went on the trip, they came back again.
[1:41:39] He gives the report to this guy who
[1:41:41] funded it. And then he says, "Well, I
[1:41:43] want to give again." And so this guy,
[1:41:45] this brother goes talk to brother Tim,
[1:41:46] says, "Well, maybe you'll just give a
[1:41:47] little bit again." He says, "No, he's
[1:41:49] going to do exactly the same thing." And
[1:41:51] exactly the same thing happened. Amen.
[1:41:54] It's exactly if sickness strikes one of
[1:41:56] your children. Remember, if you have the
[1:41:57] token, you moms and dads, your children
[1:42:00] fall under under that protection. Amen.
[1:42:03] So if they're sick, if you if you if you
[1:42:06] sign for the sickness, if you receive
[1:42:08] that sickness, well, maybe we just have
[1:42:09] to live with this for a little bit.
[1:42:11] What's going to happen? Little Johnny's
[1:42:13] going to be sick. But if you say, "I do
[1:42:15] not stand for this. This is not my
[1:42:17] portion. I do not accept this." Amen.
[1:42:19] You remember that. Amen. Then God will
[1:42:22] back up what you say.
[1:42:24] Amen. Amen. You got to be conscious of
[1:42:27] when God, you know, just this is not the
[1:42:29] power of Paul speaking. Amen. God has a
[1:42:33] power in you. But if you confess the
[1:42:35] wrong or the bad, those things will
[1:42:37] happen. Amen. But if you speak in faith,
[1:42:41] Amen. If you recognize you're a son and
[1:42:42] daughter of God, Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:42:45] You're living under a very different
[1:42:46] kind of anointing than the world is.
[1:42:48] This world is unfortunately
[1:42:51] scared and confused and not knowing
[1:42:53] what's going on. But we've re we have
[1:42:56] received a sure word of prophecy. Amen.
[1:42:59] Amen. We've received a sure word that we
[1:43:01] don't have to walk in darkness or in
[1:43:03] fear. Amen. So whenever people, you
[1:43:05] know, they might not know what they
[1:43:07] might not want what you have, but don't
[1:43:10] accept what they're trying to give you.
[1:43:12] That's right. Amen. You know, don't come
[1:43:15] under their little cloud of fear. No,
[1:43:18] you don't have to. Just like at work,
[1:43:21] people have a certain kind of
[1:43:22] atmosphere, certain kind of, you know,
[1:43:24] I I said, you know, at my work when I
[1:43:29] was there full-time, I'm now there part
[1:43:30] time, but when I was there full-time,
[1:43:31] Friday was always a chaotic day cuz it's
[1:43:34] Friday. We got to get everything signed
[1:43:35] off and done. But I came to the
[1:43:38] conclusion, why should I get stressed
[1:43:40] with everyone else? It's all going to
[1:43:42] get done anyway. It's all done anyway.
[1:43:44] We all We all get everything signed off
[1:43:46] by the end of the day. Why I get all why
[1:43:47] raise the blood pressure for for eight
[1:43:49] hours just to get it done? I said, "No,
[1:43:51] I I don't accept this." Amen.
[1:43:55] But if I accept that atmosphere,
[1:43:58] oh yes, we're all scared. How's this
[1:43:59] going to be? We're still going to get it
[1:44:02] done. Do you want to get it done the
[1:44:03] stressed way or just just just get it
[1:44:05] done and go home another day? It depends
[1:44:08] what you speak, what you receive.
[1:44:13] Amen.
[1:44:15] It's like it's like little Gabriella
[1:44:17] there. You know, well, you all know the
[1:44:19] Tesmine had that dream that she'd be
[1:44:22] born still born a month before she was
[1:44:23] born. If I accepted that, I believe she
[1:44:26] wouldn't be here today. I said, "No, I
[1:44:28] do not accept this. She's going to be
[1:44:30] born and she's going to be alive and
[1:44:33] it's going to be all right." Amen.
[1:44:34] Hallelujah. Amen. And we're driving to
[1:44:36] the hospital and we pray in the car and
[1:44:38] Christine totally forgot about the dream
[1:44:41] and she was born. Amen. Sure. She
[1:44:43] twisted the birth canal, all the things,
[1:44:45] but she was healthy and she's well.
[1:44:47] Amen. Amen. Then brother and then and
[1:44:49] then and then Liam had that lesion thing
[1:44:52] coming out, popping out. Nothing the
[1:44:54] doctor could do could settle it down. I
[1:44:56] gave that testimony. Brother Arman heard
[1:44:58] what I said. We do not accept this
[1:45:00] sickness and it went away, didn't it? Go
[1:45:02] away. See, because of the power of the
[1:45:04] spoken word. Amen. Amen. That's right.
[1:45:07] Amen. That's why that's why don't create
[1:45:09] an atmosphere of fear around you. Amen.
[1:45:12] or or unbelief, you got to say, "No."
[1:45:14] That's why you got to speak. You dads,
[1:45:15] moms, you got to speak to your family
[1:45:17] and say, "We're believers." Amen. We're
[1:45:19] under a sure token. Amen. I've met God.
[1:45:22] Amen. Amen. Amen. Have you or have you
[1:45:24] not? Amen. Amen. Abraham met God. Paul
[1:45:27] met God on the road to Damascus. All the
[1:45:29] believers down through the ages have met
[1:45:31] the Lord Jesus Christ. That's right.
[1:45:32] He's the same. Hebrews 39. He's the same
[1:45:34] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[1:45:37] Amen. You say, "Well, how do I know
[1:45:38] there's a divine influence come upon
[1:45:40] you?" Amen. And the life you once lived,
[1:45:42] it's not in you to live it anymore.
[1:45:44] Something's happened to you.
[1:45:48] Amen. This that's why you've just got to
[1:45:50] you have to This is the age.
[1:45:53] Amen. Of the manifestation of the
[1:45:54] revealing of the sons of God. Amen. What
[1:45:57] really was you know, you look at Rahab.
[1:45:59] Where did she get that scarlet? Where
[1:46:01] did she get the token from?
[1:46:03] She had it in her house. Amen. That's
[1:46:05] right. She had it in her house. She had
[1:46:07] that scarlet rope thread in her house.
[1:46:09] Amen. But it would faith cometh by
[1:46:11] hearing and hearing the word of God. She
[1:46:12] had to hear the testimonies what
[1:46:15] happened in Egypt. But then she had to
[1:46:16] say to the spies, I want mercy. Amen.
[1:46:19] And that changed her whole life. Now she
[1:46:21] wasn't under the influence like everyone
[1:46:23] else was afraid. That's right. In
[1:46:24] Jericho, she had received mercy. And so
[1:46:28] it's the same thing with you. Now
[1:46:29] remember, she was told, "Get everyone
[1:46:32] under this token and they'll be safe."
[1:46:35] Amen. It's the same thing with you.
[1:46:38] There's a seed in you. Hallelujah. We
[1:46:40] believe in predestination. It gives a
[1:46:42] lot of stability. Hallelujah. Because
[1:46:44] once really saved, you can never be
[1:46:46] lost.
[1:46:48] Amen. God is a God of stability. And so
[1:46:51] now God, it's the same thing with us. We
[1:46:54] had the token, but then when you heard
[1:46:56] the word for your day and something
[1:46:58] quickened on the inside of you, then it
[1:47:00] can be displayed. Amen. Then it can be
[1:47:03] put into action. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:47:05] Because that seed that was in you, that
[1:47:07] was laying in you. Amen. And you were
[1:47:10] looking for things in life. Surely this
[1:47:11] is how it is. And maybe you studied and
[1:47:13] tried to work things out, you know, but
[1:47:15] then one day you heard the word and it's
[1:47:17] something quickened on the inside of you
[1:47:18] like nothing else has spoken to you.
[1:47:21] What's happened? Same with thing with
[1:47:22] Rahab. Then then you can put the token
[1:47:24] on display. Amen. And what is that
[1:47:27] token? You create a spiritual atmosphere
[1:47:28] around you. People know you're
[1:47:31] different.
[1:47:32] Amen. people. You know, when I was at
[1:47:35] university, I worked part-time in a
[1:47:38] kitchen as a as a as a dishwasher.
[1:47:41] During that time, I meet the Lord. I
[1:47:43] don't tell my workmates who had known me
[1:47:44] from the very beginning anything had
[1:47:46] happened. But then Christy and I get
[1:47:48] married. She works in the same kitchen
[1:47:49] for a little bit. And they say to her,
[1:47:52] you know, we are so happy when Ben met
[1:47:54] his God. Was before he was empty,
[1:47:56] depressed, and down. What had happened?
[1:47:58] Something had happened. I didn't need to
[1:48:00] say anything. They knew something had
[1:48:01] happened to me. Yeah. Amen. There's an
[1:48:04] atmosphere. Remember, a sheep
[1:48:07] doesn't plan to grow wool.
[1:48:10] It doesn't, you know, you know, they
[1:48:12] don't have a team meeting in the start
[1:48:13] of the day. Now, boys, see this grass?
[1:48:15] We're going to eat this paddic. We're

[1:48:18] down. You know, cheering season's coming
[1:48:20] up. Come. We got to We really got to do
[1:48:22] it.

[1:48:27] the right things. They feed on the right
[1:48:30] grass. And it just there's a life in
[1:48:31] them that grows the wool. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:34] It's the same thing with a believer. We
[1:48:36] don't have to say now Lord. Yeah.
[1:48:38] Because we're called to be conformed to
[1:48:39] the image of the sun. I want these seven
[1:48:41] virtues in my life. I want to be the
[1:48:43] very image of Christ upon the earth. And
[1:48:45] I know I've got to do this and do this
[1:48:46] and do this. No.
[1:48:48] There's a life in you. You feed on the
[1:48:51] right kind of things. That's right. And
[1:48:53] it lives. Amen. That's the truth. Amen.
[1:48:57] You just got to let it live. That's
[1:48:59] right. That's all you have to do. Just
[1:49:01] yield and let God have his way.
[1:49:04] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Let's have
[1:49:07] musicians come, shall we?
[1:49:10] That's all you have to do. Create an
[1:49:13] atmosphere. And Brother Bram says people
[1:49:16] will come under the influence of that
[1:49:18] atmosphere you create.
[1:49:21] Amen. And they'll drop right into it.
[1:49:24] That's why he says in love and godly
[1:49:26] consideration, you pray and then you
[1:49:28] say, "I'm going after I'm going after my
[1:49:30] son or daughter or whoever it is." Say,
[1:49:33] "Lord, you catch them when I go."
[1:49:36] What is that? You're applying the token.
[1:49:38] It's not saying some handrasy thing. You
[1:49:41] put it in
[1:49:42] action. Amen.
[1:49:44] Rahab put the token she had into action
[1:49:48] and she got everyone she would come into
[1:49:51] this house that used to be a den of
[1:49:53] prostitution. Come in. This is where
[1:49:55] it's safe. Amen. Now you say, "Well,
[1:49:58] people will never believe me." Her
[1:50:00] family believed her.
[1:50:03] Amen. Oh, it's just some hatched up
[1:50:04] idea. But eventually they saw her
[1:50:06] something had happened to her. And they
[1:50:09] could see she's a different kind of
[1:50:10] woman.
[1:50:12] Amen. And it so it doesn't matter now.
[1:50:15] You say, "Well, lots of things happened
[1:50:17] to me in life that have been bad and my
[1:50:19] situation whatever more." Don't look at
[1:50:21] where you're from. Look at where you're
[1:50:23] going. Amen. Let the past be in the
[1:50:26] past.
[1:50:27] Amen. Just lay it under lay it under the
[1:50:30] blood and just walk on. Amen. She didn't
[1:50:33] let her past hold her back. Amen. Just
[1:50:35] under the blood of bulls and goats. How
[1:50:36] much more us?
[1:50:41] Amen. I want to I want to sing that song
[1:50:43] again. It is well with my soul. If you
[1:50:45] like to all stand with me, I trust it's
[1:50:47] well with your souls, friends.
[1:50:52] I trust his grace has come upon you. His
[1:50:55] divine influence.
[1:50:59] Amen. If it hasn't, why don't you talk
[1:51:01] to him now? This is not
[1:51:02] religion. I don't want religion. This is
[1:51:06] reality. What what happened to me nearly
[1:51:08] 9 years ago changed me forever.
[1:51:12] Amen. And it wasn't I wasn't looking for
[1:51:14] it. I wasn't a religious person going to
[1:51:17] churches and churches, but God found
[1:51:20] me.
[1:51:21] Amen. Now I say it
[1:51:25] works. Amen. So I I trust you can say it
[1:51:27] is well with my soul.
[1:51:37] Well, my
[1:51:39] soul of

[2:04:19] Heat. Heat.

[2:05:56] thankful, Lord, we're so glad, Lord, you
[2:05:59] came down. Father, bring us redemption,
[2:06:02] Lord Jesus. without money or price.
[2:06:04] Father, nothing we could do, oh God. We
[2:06:06] just accept it, Lord Jesus. Father, we
[2:06:08] praise your mighty name. You haven't
[2:06:10] left us in this dark hour. Lord, you
[2:06:12] haven't left us stumbling in darkness
[2:06:13] wondering what's going on. But Lord,
[2:06:15] you've become a personal God to us,
[2:06:17] Lord. Father, you're a living God, Lord.
[2:06:20] You're our comforter, Lord Jesus.
[2:06:21] Father, you're our peace, oh God.
[2:06:24] Father, you're our guide, Lord Jesus.
[2:06:25] You're our king. You're our husband.
[2:06:27] You're our priest. You're our sacrifice,
[2:06:29] Lord. You're our sustainer, oh Lord.
[2:06:31] You're our protector. You're our
[2:06:33] defender, oh Lord Jesus. You're the
[2:06:34] lover of our souls, oh God. You're our
[2:06:36] bridegroom, Lord. You're our coming
[2:06:38] king, Lord Jesus. I praise your mighty
[2:06:40] name. Thank you, Lord, that we can be
[2:06:43] standing on a fault line, but yet we are
[2:06:44] as safe as safe can be. Lord, we have no
[2:06:47] fear, oh God, because we have a sure
[2:06:49] token, Lord. Doesn't matter what happens
[2:06:51] to this world, Lord. Father, you said
[2:06:53] you'd keep us, oh God. You would protect
[2:06:55] us, oh God. You'll keep us safe, Lord
[2:06:57] Jesus. Lord, we praise your holy name.
[2:06:59] Lord, we don't worry, Lord. If this is
[2:07:01] our last time in church, Lord, we praise
[2:07:03] your holy name. Lord, if we leave these
[2:07:06] doors and it's our last time alive, we
[2:07:08] praise your holy name, Father, because
[2:07:10] Lord, we know death is just a travel bus
[2:07:12] to get us to where we really want. We
[2:07:14] really where we want to go. Oh Lord, we
[2:07:16] praise your holy name. Lord, we're so
[2:07:18] glad we have blessed assurance. Jesus is
[2:07:20] ours. Oh, what a foretaste of glory
[2:07:22] divine. Lord, we praise your holy name.
[2:07:26] Oh, Lord. What a blessed assurance that
[2:07:28] you belong to us, oh God. Hallelujah.
[2:07:31] Oh, we're bought with a price, Lord.
[2:07:32] We're your property, Lord Jesus. Praise
[2:07:35] your holy name. Father, I pray for each
[2:07:37] one here, oh God. Draw them all to you,
[2:07:40] I pray. Take all fear out of every
[2:07:42] heart, Lord. May they not worry about
[2:07:44] what may happen. Lord, may look at your
[2:07:47] promise, Lord. Father, your word is work
[2:07:49] worked all the way from creation down to
[2:07:51] now. It cannot fail. And Lord, you've
[2:07:54] caused us to believe your word in this
[2:07:56] hour. We thank you, Father. You've
[2:07:58] promised us a way of escape in this time
[2:08:00] of trouble. Lord, we look for you to
[2:08:02] come and snatch us away, oh God. We
[2:08:04] praise your holy name, Lord. Bless each
[2:08:06] one, oh God. Father, as we go our
[2:08:08] separate ways, Lord, bring us safely
[2:08:10] back together tonight for the communion
[2:08:12] footwashing service, Lord. Father, may
[2:08:14] we have a special time around your
[2:08:15] table, Lord, with thanksgiving that
[2:08:18] Lord, we've passed from death unto life.
[2:08:20] Lord, doesn't matter all the burdens we
[2:08:21] carry and the struggles of life and
[2:08:24] whatever we may be facing. We've passed
[2:08:25] from death under life, oh God.
[2:08:27] Hallelujah. We praise your holy name.
[2:08:29] Yes, Lord. Oh Lord, have your way among
[2:08:31] us, we ask. Father, we commit each,
[2:08:33] Lord, each one here into your hands.
[2:08:36] Dismiss us with your blessing now. We
[2:08:37] pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask.
[2:08:40] Amen.
[2:08:42] Hallelujah.
[2:08:43] Amen. Just as we go. Amen. Let's just
[2:08:46] sing. You chose me.
[2:08:48] Hallelujah.
[2:08:50] Amen. The God that saved you is not
[2:08:54] going to leave you here. Amen. The God
[2:08:56] that met you is not going to leave you
[2:08:58] here. He doesn't just make you a
[2:09:00] believer just to leave you to go into
[2:09:01] darkness. Remember, this message came to
[2:09:03] take a bride into eternity. Amen. This
[2:09:06] is why I said we're not preparing for a
[2:09:08] tribulation. Amen. We're not preparing
[2:09:10] for a tribulation, but we're preparing
[2:09:12] for a rapture. And God has given us what
[2:09:14] we need to be ready for that rapture.
[2:09:16] He's released his word to transform us
[2:09:19] that we're rapture ready. Amen. He's
[2:09:22] released a word and his word never
[2:09:24] returns to him void. It will accomplish
[2:09:26] that which is sent forth and it's sent
[2:09:29] to transform you to place a power in
[2:09:32] you. Why is the spirit of God in me to
[2:09:35] take me in a rapture? Amen.
[2:09:38] You have that assurance. This is what
[2:09:40] this says. It says he that believeth
[2:09:42] Wait, wait. I just need to read a
[2:09:45] scripture to you.
[2:09:50] Says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you."
[2:09:52] John
[2:09:54] 5:24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
[2:09:57] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[2:10:01] him that sent me." Trust you can put
[2:10:03] yourself in the scripture. Hath
[2:10:06] everlasting life has it now and shall
[2:10:09] not come into the condemnation. The
[2:10:11] condemnation which is the judgment but
[2:10:14] is passed from death unto life. So that
[2:10:17] judgment is a great white throne
[2:10:18] judgment. Him that heareth my word and
[2:10:20] believeth on him that sent me is not
[2:10:23] going to the great white throne
[2:10:24] judgment. Amen. Has everlasting life and
[2:10:27] has passed from death to life. This is a
[2:10:29] bright scripture. Who believes? Amen.
[2:10:33] Whose the word has transformed and
[2:10:35] changed them. Amen. You're not the
[2:10:37] person you once were.
[2:10:39] Amen. Why are you not the person you
[2:10:41] once were? Because grace has come upon
[2:10:43] you. Divine influence upon your heart
[2:10:45] has happened. Well, I have this and I
[2:10:48] have this and I have this. Don't worry
[2:10:49] about those things. Rahab was a harlot
[2:10:51] on the wall. Bad place to be. Wasn't
[2:10:54] welcome in any of their churches. Wasn't
[2:10:56] welcome in their society. Really, she
[2:10:58] was a harlot.
[2:11:00] Oh, look at these two foreigners going
[2:11:01] into that house. I wonder what they're
[2:11:02] going there for.
[2:11:05] Amen. She was the least likely one to be
[2:11:09] delivered in that time of destruction.
[2:11:11] Amen. She wasn't the military. She
[2:11:14] wasn't the religious people. She wasn't
[2:11:16] an important part of the society, but
[2:11:18] she received mercy.
[2:11:21] Hello, Rahab.
[2:11:24] Amen. Oh, my life is not in a good
[2:11:27] situation right now. What has God made
[2:11:30] you? Amen. You're not once you want. You
[2:11:33] see, I'm I'm not the person I once was.
[2:11:36] I'm now different cuz he has changed me.
[2:11:38] And if he's changed me this much, he's
[2:11:40] going to transform me all the way to a
[2:11:42] body change.
[2:11:45] Amen. Let's sing this, shall we?
[2:11:49] Were it not for thy nail scar
[2:11:56] hands? Nail scar
[2:11:59] hands and
[2:12:01] thorny
[2:12:03] men were
[2:12:07] in thy love for me.
[2:12:13] unfailing love that chose
[2:12:19] Calary. Then such a
[2:12:24] one time
[2:12:26] I would have
[2:12:31] no and I
[2:12:34] die. But thou, oh
[2:12:38] Lord, you took my place. Yes, you did,
[2:12:42] Lord. You took my
[2:12:45] place. You took my
[2:12:49] place.
[2:12:50] Hallelujah. Yes,
[2:12:52] Lord. And you bore my sin on your
[2:13:00] shoulders when you could have
[2:13:03] had it all. He chose thee to be the one
[2:13:09] that you would die
[2:13:11] for. The one that you would
[2:13:14] save, the one that you would carry. From
[2:13:19] the cradle to the
[2:13:22] grave, the one that you would care
[2:13:26] for, the one that you would
[2:13:29] raise, the one that you would see
[2:13:32] through every storm. In every way you
[2:13:37] chose
[2:13:43] me. You chose
[2:13:51] me. Your head was bowed and your
[2:13:59] body. Oh mercy called the ransom.
[2:14:03] You gave and I took on your
[2:14:08] shaking
[2:14:10] shoulders my
[2:14:16] s for the price you
[2:14:21] paid and
[2:14:26] sle them desire
[2:14:33] Oh my
[2:14:36] god. But thou, oh
[2:14:40] Lord, it's of my
[2:14:43] place. It's of my
[2:14:47] place. It's my place.
[2:14:52] as
[2:14:53] you. Oh, and you hold my s on your
[2:15:01] shoulders when you could have had it
[2:15:06] all. You chose me to be the one that you
[2:15:11] would die
[2:15:12] for. The one that you would
[2:15:16] save, the one that you would carry. From
[2:15:20] the cradle to the
[2:15:23] grave, the one that you would care
[2:15:27] for. The one that you would
[2:15:30] praise, the one that you would see
[2:15:34] through every storm and every wave. You
[2:15:38] chose
[2:15:44] me. You chose
[2:15:48] me. And you bore. Aren't you glad he
[2:15:50] bore your son? And you bore my sin on
[2:15:56] your
[2:15:58] shoulders when you could have had it
[2:16:02] all. You chose me to be. The one that
[2:16:07] you would die for, the one that you
[2:16:11] would
[2:16:12] save, the one that you would carry. From
[2:16:17] the cradle to the
[2:16:19] grave. The one that you would care for,
[2:16:24] the one that you would
[2:16:27] praise, the one that you would see
[2:16:30] through every storm and every wave. He
[2:16:34] chose
[2:16:40] me. He chose
[2:16:45] me.
[2:16:47] me. You chose
[2:16:53] me. Yes, Lord. You chose
[2:17:01] me. Hallelujah.
[2:17:04] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. God
[2:17:06] bless you, friend Judah Smith and Jesus
[2:17:08] Christ.
