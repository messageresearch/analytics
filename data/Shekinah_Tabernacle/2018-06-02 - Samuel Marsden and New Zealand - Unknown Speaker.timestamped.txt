[59:27] okay so you all kind of know me by now
[59:35] my um my messages are slightly different
[59:39] I just do what I do and I like to look
[59:43] into things in study on things I get a
[59:46] little subject and I just like to look
[59:47] around at it and it takes me about a
[59:50] week I just by the time I finished
[59:52] preparing it I think I'm done you know
[59:55] I've gotten all I want out of it and
[59:56] delivering it as a wee bit different
[59:58] because most of my inspiration comes
[59:59] when I just dig out but this is a
[1:00:01] different one and I've had this on my
[1:00:03] heart to do for quite a while I thought
[1:00:05] if I do we know when they win brother
[1:00:08] beam pulls out the spare tire you know
[1:00:09] do this one here and I've wanted to do a
[1:00:13] study on it started off being a study
[1:00:17] just on the message in New Zealand in a
[1:00:18] bit of a historical context and then I
[1:00:20] kind of thought well I can't really do
[1:00:21] that unless I go back and maybe a few
[1:00:24] hundred years and get get the look at
[1:00:27] when Christianity came to this country
[1:00:29] and then take it all the way through so
[1:00:32] I was going to have it all the way
[1:00:33] through from about 1720 to about 2018
[1:00:39] but I realized you couldn't quite do it
[1:00:42] in one hour and I barely got through I
[1:00:47] was having trouble getting that the the
[1:00:49] man that first brought the gospel here I
[1:00:51] was having trouble even getting him to
[1:00:54] the shores of New Zealand I was at sixty
[1:00:56] slides until he hadn't even got here so
[1:00:58] I thought there's no way that I'm going
[1:01:00] to go into you know that what the Lord
[1:01:03] did in this country in the you know in
[1:01:05] those times and through the merry people
[1:01:07] in there and the revivals that came here
[1:01:09] and then the message that the brother
[1:01:11] that brought the message here and how
[1:01:12] that sort of spread through the country
[1:01:14] Shannon said to me don't say this but
[1:01:16] I'm going to say it anyway
[1:01:17] I my next one if when you know I do
[1:01:22] about two a year maybe it may be I may
[1:01:24] do this in a three-part series so the
[1:01:25] next one may be today I'm just going to
[1:01:28] do it to the gospel coming here and then
[1:01:29] the next one may be the gospel Hallett
[1:01:32] works for about a hundred years and then
[1:01:34] the next one may be the message how the
[1:01:36] message came around because there's many
[1:01:38] great Testim
[1:01:39] but the purpose of it is is to realize
[1:01:42] that we're not just here coincidentally
[1:01:45] and in our life is significant it's not
[1:01:50] we are part of a greater plan than just
[1:01:54] what we think we are we're actually part
[1:01:56] of a great plan of God and sometimes
[1:01:57] when you step back and look at what
[1:01:59] God's done you it gives us a bit more
[1:02:02] it's given me a bit more encouragement
[1:02:03] to actually realize you know what I'm a
[1:02:05] part of a bigger plan I'm fighting for
[1:02:07] the kingdom of God that's actually doing
[1:02:09] a work and and I don't want to get
[1:02:13] sidetracked on other things but I want
[1:02:14] to actually see the master and say Lord
[1:02:16] what so what's the job for me today
[1:02:18] what's our plan what are we doing and
[1:02:20] realizing we we there was a plan for us
[1:02:22] so I'm driving three things this morning
[1:02:27] can you turn that
[1:02:28] okay so let's slide on now the scripture
[1:02:35] I'm going to read
[1:02:36] there's revelations 3:8 it's just part
[1:02:39] of the salasi you can just some read it
[1:02:41] from here and it's I know though it
[1:02:42] works behold I've set before thee an
[1:02:44] open door and no man can shut it for
[1:02:46] thou has a little strength and has kept
[1:02:47] my word and it's not denied my name
[1:02:49] and the reason why I read that is
[1:02:52] because the time period that we're going
[1:02:54] to go into as as what brother Branham
[1:02:55] called the open door age you know we're
[1:02:57] where the Lord opened up a door for
[1:03:00] missionaries and for the gospel to go
[1:03:01] out throughout the world and in this
[1:03:03] little study you kind of see the
[1:03:06] dynamics of how that came about and why
[1:03:08] that could happen in kind of why it's
[1:03:10] not happening now but so this was the
[1:03:13] thrust of the gospel at that time was
[1:03:15] actually was the open door age where the
[1:03:17] gospel could go out and we're going to
[1:03:19] be studying a man called samuel marsden
[1:03:21] who's heard of samuel marsden hey we've
[1:03:25] got some out-of-towners out of countries
[1:03:28] that have heard of samuel marsden
[1:03:30] there's a college in wellington here
[1:03:33] called um Marsden college I think it's
[1:03:35] called Marsden girls college yep that's
[1:03:38] named after Samuel Marsden I think
[1:03:39] there's a his Marsden point where they
[1:03:41] do the picture of the oil refinery so
[1:03:44] we're gonna be studying a man called
[1:03:45] Seema Muslim because he he essentially
[1:03:48] was though the one that that the Lord
[1:03:51] used to bring the gospel into this
[1:03:52] country for
[1:03:53] now this is by no means a political
[1:03:57] sermon my kingdom is the kingdom of God
[1:04:01] I appreciate politicians more the more
[1:04:04] and more I appreciate them but this is
[1:04:06] not political at all because without
[1:04:10] perfect love you can't have peace or
[1:04:12] anything and our kingdom the kingdom of
[1:04:15] God is perfect love and you can't get
[1:04:17] that here now I appreciate men that try
[1:04:20] their best to make things as best as
[1:04:21] they can but you can't get that here
[1:04:23] ultimately so at a certain point I just
[1:04:26] leave it all alone and say Lord I can't
[1:04:28] wait for the new kingdom we're perfect
[1:04:30] love reigns that's what we're after now
[1:04:33] I've got a few to get through so I'm
[1:04:34] going to try and rush through this this
[1:04:37] man is Samuel must and I'm gonna go
[1:04:38] through the history of him can you all
[1:04:45] see that okay at the back okay good now
[1:04:49] he was born 28 to July 1764 and near
[1:04:55] Leeds and England have you been to Leeds
[1:04:58] you guys looked at Lilian you been there
[1:05:00] nice place this is it here yeah got a
[1:05:02] few little pictures of it if he was
[1:05:06] alive he would be 254 years old so it's
[1:05:11] not really that long ago when you think
[1:05:14] about it it's not that long ago its
[1:05:17] appearance we're just he was just an
[1:05:19] average guy's parents were appearance
[1:05:21] was a father was a farmer and I think he
[1:05:23] did a bit of butchery he was he wasn't
[1:05:26] really anything of note essentially but
[1:05:28] he loved the Lord and that showed and
[1:05:33] his and his zeal as he was growing up he
[1:05:35] just had a desire for the things of the
[1:05:36] Lord school was just went to school and
[1:05:41] learnt like everyone else did but he
[1:05:43] always had a desire to want to work in
[1:05:47] there not so much the mission but just
[1:05:48] work for the kingdom of God to be a
[1:05:49] minister or something like that he just
[1:05:50] had this desire and I'm going to talk
[1:05:55] about the eland Society I'll bring this
[1:05:57] the the Society and there were a few
[1:05:59] societies like this that were formed at
[1:06:01] the time and these societies were formed
[1:06:05] by
[1:06:07] politically powerful and wealthy men in
[1:06:10] England who had a desire that the gospel
[1:06:13] would be spread throughout the world and
[1:06:17] the the one of the societies was called
[1:06:20] the eland society and a few of the men
[1:06:22] that that were part of the formation of
[1:06:24] this of the society was this man here
[1:06:27] Henry Thornton maybe you don't know
[1:06:30] Henry Thornton but they actually call
[1:06:31] him the father of modern banking and he
[1:06:36] the world knows him if you're in the if
[1:06:39] you're in the economic circles you would
[1:06:40] know this man here so they know him in a
[1:06:43] and an economic sense and indeed
[1:06:46] economically in in London the owned he
[1:06:48] was part of a group of three of them
[1:06:49] that they had one of the biggest banks
[1:06:51] in London and they spread out throughout
[1:06:52] the UK so he was very wealthy but he was
[1:06:55] also a devout Christian man that had a
[1:06:58] desire to see the gospel spread
[1:07:00] throughout the world and he actually was
[1:07:03] part of societies the CMS he was part of
[1:07:06] forming that he was part of the
[1:07:07] formation of the Bible Society these men
[1:07:09] formed a lot of organizations to
[1:07:11] actually whatever way they could to
[1:07:13] spread the gospel he wasn't so much a
[1:07:15] minister or anything but he just wanted
[1:07:17] to put his money and effort into the
[1:07:19] gospel another men was this man you may
[1:07:22] have heard of this men William
[1:07:24] Wilberforce
[1:07:24] he was the he was at a politician these
[1:07:29] two I think were they were cousins and
[1:07:31] he he was the man that his whole one of
[1:07:35] his missions that he felt was to abolish
[1:07:39] slavery throughout the British Empire so
[1:07:42] that was it was what he fought for
[1:07:44] amongst other things he was part of
[1:07:46] these PCN lots of different
[1:07:48] organizations that would push good
[1:07:49] causes and he achieved that the
[1:07:53] abolishment of slavery as well another
[1:07:55] man that was part of the group and part
[1:07:57] of their friends was John Newton and he
[1:07:59] was the man that wrote Amazing Grace so
[1:08:01] there was all these there was all these
[1:08:03] men there was Joseph Milner he that he
[1:08:07] wrote though he was very well known for
[1:08:08] writing a commentary on the Old
[1:08:10] Testament he didn't put a lot of work
[1:08:12] into that now these were very powerful
[1:08:16] men politically powerful men essentially
[1:08:18] some of the wealthiest most powerful men
[1:08:20] in the
[1:08:20] world but they had a desire to spread
[1:08:22] the gospel and say you start
[1:08:24] understanding why this could be an open
[1:08:25] door edge because in this day and age
[1:08:27] when when we want to go and seen brother
[1:08:30] Andy to Vietnam essentially he's got to
[1:08:34] try and hook into his own back pocket or
[1:08:36] you know we try and give a little bit
[1:08:37] here a little bit there to help him out
[1:08:38] for argument's sake mission work back in
[1:08:41] that time there was a essentially almost
[1:08:43] a country and the political powers
[1:08:47] backing mission work so there was there
[1:08:50] was money and effort and time and groups
[1:08:52] and everything pushing it to actually
[1:08:55] see that it could happen and part of
[1:08:56] this group the eland society their their
[1:08:58] goal was to get people that were keen to
[1:09:01] that they felt they had a call on of the
[1:09:03] Lord upon their life and and essentially
[1:09:06] pay for them to go through college power
[1:09:07] their expenses and then and then send
[1:09:10] them out throughout the world as
[1:09:11] missionaries and pay all their expenses
[1:09:13] so this group they had a expressed
[1:09:15] purpose of sending the gospel out and
[1:09:17] they came across samuel marsden and they
[1:09:20] realized that this is a sort of person
[1:09:22] we want to be supporting so they they
[1:09:24] support it and they took him out of his
[1:09:26] school and they he went to this Saint
[1:09:30] John's College to those times you'd sort
[1:09:32] of study I think he was part of the
[1:09:33] Church of England but they would train
[1:09:36] him up and what's the purpose of sending
[1:09:39] these men out to to spread the gospel
[1:09:41] all around the world I need to bring in
[1:09:47] a bit of background history here London
[1:09:50] and 1780 this was kind of the Industrial
[1:09:57] Revolution was happening and so a lot of
[1:09:59] the people from the the countryside and
[1:10:01] that the country were moving into the
[1:10:03] bigger cities and they were setting up
[1:10:04] factories and things like that
[1:10:05] there was a lot of child labor going on
[1:10:07] and all these sorts of things a lot of
[1:10:08] the politicians that we just looked at
[1:10:10] were part of trying to get rid of that
[1:10:11] those sort of systems and those
[1:10:14] practices but as a result of all the
[1:10:17] influx of people into the cities there
[1:10:21] because factories would come and go and
[1:10:23] things would change the a lot of people
[1:10:24] ended up there with no work and they
[1:10:26] became a lot of social unrest and there
[1:10:28] was a lot of I guess pity crime in crime
[1:10:30] and then they apparently gin they
[1:10:33] learned how to make Jen
[1:10:34] so they sort of spread through the
[1:10:35] cities so half the town almost all the
[1:10:38] common people would just became drunks
[1:10:40] and it was a it was a chaotic place
[1:10:41] apparently and another thing that
[1:10:44] happened was there was a death penalty
[1:10:46] for so many things in that time there
[1:10:49] was a death penalty for if you stole a
[1:10:51] rabbit out of a rabbit hole you could be
[1:10:53] put to death for it and and they were
[1:10:55] just people were being put to death for
[1:10:57] mainly for crimes of theft there's a lot
[1:11:00] of and see the politicians we're
[1:11:01] realizing that this is a bit too extreme
[1:11:03] to put people to death for these things
[1:11:06] but then the concept of a jail like a
[1:11:09] prison they thought no that's American
[1:11:11] that's kind of like how the Americans do
[1:11:12] it we don't want that so their idea was
[1:11:14] just to seem people to other countries
[1:11:17] was the at this solution so they were
[1:11:19] actually sending people to America they
[1:11:22] sent about fifty thousand convicts to
[1:11:24] America until there was the War of
[1:11:27] Independence and in course after that
[1:11:28] the Americans didn't want any more
[1:11:29] convicts sent over so that that little
[1:11:32] party was stopped and so Captain Cook
[1:11:35] came and he did his venture around the
[1:11:38] South Pacific and he told them of a
[1:11:39] place called they called it New Holland
[1:11:41] but we know it as Australia and then
[1:11:44] they came up with this idea well that's
[1:11:45] it probably a nice place we can looks
[1:11:47] like a pretty barren land we'll just
[1:11:48] maybe we'll ship with our convicts out
[1:11:50] to there because they didn't want to
[1:11:52] start like kill him all but they didn't
[1:11:53] want to have them in prisons in the UK
[1:11:55] they didn't like the idea so they that's
[1:11:58] what they did so at that time over the
[1:12:03] course of 20 or 30 years sorry over the
[1:12:06] course of about 80 years they shipped
[1:12:08] 100 and around about a hundred and sixty
[1:12:09] two thousand convicts some just petty
[1:12:14] criminals some bad guys to Australia
[1:12:16] year after year after year they sent
[1:12:19] convicts they're the first ones the
[1:12:21] first boat arrived in 1788 and on the
[1:12:26] 20th of January but they came to one
[1:12:28] band they saw it wasn't gonna suit what
[1:12:31] they were doing so they went out to
[1:12:32] another Bay and Port Jackson this was
[1:12:34] this is in Sydney Parramatta and they
[1:12:37] went ashore on the 26th of January and
[1:12:39] and started the new convict colony
[1:12:43] essentially and the Australian celebrate
[1:12:45] Australia Day well that's the date where
[1:12:47] the
[1:12:47] convicts first turned up so that's what
[1:12:50] they celebrate their 20 percent of
[1:12:54] Australians descendants of convicts so
[1:12:59] this is a very significant portion of
[1:13:01] the population the when they decided a
[1:13:06] plan to seen the convicts there they
[1:13:09] still wanted to have some sort of
[1:13:10] Christian influence off on the country
[1:13:12] so the the man they appointed to be the
[1:13:18] chaplain of the colony and to try and
[1:13:20] keep some sort of Christian order to it
[1:13:21] was a man Richard Johnson and he held
[1:13:25] the first sort of Christian service in
[1:13:29] terms of a at British well I guess it
[1:13:32] was because the Aborigines weren't
[1:13:33] serving the the Lord as we know so that
[1:13:37] was that they they turned up on the 26th
[1:13:39] and in the first Sunday was the febri
[1:13:41] the third and they had the first
[1:13:42] Christian service that day and that was
[1:13:45] run by Richard Johnson and I've just got
[1:13:48] a little um black there too it
[1:13:51] commemorates it and people like John
[1:13:54] Newton were they were influential and
[1:13:56] getting this man over there and William
[1:13:58] Wilberforce than those people so now we
[1:14:02] we that was that was the time when
[1:14:08] samuel marsden was going through college
[1:14:10] and starting to decide they were they
[1:14:13] were they didn't know where they were
[1:14:14] going to send him but he was going
[1:14:16] through his training and over time they
[1:14:18] thought that we need another chaplain in
[1:14:22] Australia to help this other man because
[1:14:24] one there is just not enough so they
[1:14:27] approached him when he was 29 and said
[1:14:29] would you like the job of being the
[1:14:30] second chaplain and Parramatta in Sydney
[1:14:34] in Australia he refused at first because
[1:14:37] he said I'm only 29 I can't do this I'm
[1:14:39] too young you know but they they must
[1:14:45] have seen something in him and they they
[1:14:46] pressured him to say no we think you
[1:14:47] should be the one that goes there so in
[1:14:49] the end he took up their invitation to
[1:14:51] go and become a chaplain the second
[1:14:54] second-in-command chaplain in Australia
[1:14:57] so now that he was coming from a very
[1:15:00] political
[1:15:01] he wasn't just a nobody being sent here
[1:15:04] tune up and say guys I'm here I'm so and
[1:15:06] so can I do something here he was going
[1:15:08] in through official channels as a
[1:15:09] minister of the gospel to to push
[1:15:12] Christianity officially it wasn't an
[1:15:13] unofficial like like brother and he's
[1:15:15] going to Vietnam unofficially know that
[1:15:17] that we do mission work now unofficially
[1:15:19] almost but this was official business so
[1:15:22] he was living near Leeds and then he
[1:15:27] when he decided to take it up he um
[1:15:30] sorry I should have I've got to going so
[1:15:34] I'll try and keep this one going as well
[1:15:35] as Marlon
[1:15:39] he went to Hull and he had to wait me
[1:15:43] for about eight months because he was
[1:15:44] going to be going to Australia on a
[1:15:46] convict ship because they were the only
[1:15:47] ships that were going there so he had to
[1:15:49] wait for the convict ship to tune up
[1:15:50] well he was there he married his
[1:15:53] lifelong wife Elizabeth Tristan that
[1:15:56] this was April 1793 so he married here
[1:15:59] well he was there and then in August the
[1:16:05] convict ship turned up to Hull and they
[1:16:07] had to go down to a little place called
[1:16:09] Portsmouth and stop and there maybe pick
[1:16:12] up more convicts there and they're never
[1:16:13] going to head to Australia from there
[1:16:17] apparently he was preaching a service
[1:16:20] because it was a Sunday he was part way
[1:16:22] through preaching his service and you
[1:16:23] heard the guns or the Bell whatever the
[1:16:26] ship does that the ships leaving and so
[1:16:29] he's he's part way through service and
[1:16:30] he sees the ships leaving over gotta go
[1:16:32] and hop on the ship so he runs down to
[1:16:34] the ship and history tells us that all
[1:16:36] the congregation sort of followed him
[1:16:38] down and followed him out to the shore
[1:16:39] and then he went off to the ship I think
[1:16:41] that they see that in the book I read
[1:16:42] because they had a he gained a lot of
[1:16:44] respect where he went because he had it
[1:16:46] as I think they realized his motive was
[1:16:48] pure and as intentions were pure
[1:16:59] can you forward that please
[1:17:06] thank you this place here is called the
[1:17:09] Isle of Man who's heard of the Isle of
[1:17:10] men
[1:17:12] okay ports mouths as as just as in
[1:17:16] England and the Isle of Man is a small
[1:17:18] little island I want they always want to
[1:17:19] talk about this for a second there was a
[1:17:22] lady there called Elizabeth Walbridge
[1:17:25] she she was just like a any other I
[1:17:30] guess normal teenager growing up and the
[1:17:33] UK and we go heads Christian values but
[1:17:38] over time a new teenage year see she
[1:17:40] didn't want it she rebelled against it
[1:17:41] she said she didn't do anything bad she
[1:17:43] just was prideful I didn't think that
[1:17:45] she needed God or anything like that so
[1:17:46] I don't want to go to church I'm I'm
[1:17:48] fine
[1:17:49] so she was nothing there was no real
[1:17:52] significant testimony about her but she
[1:17:55] went to a service on one Sunday and she
[1:17:57] was so convicted by what you heard that
[1:17:59] she just she thought now I've got to
[1:18:00] serve the Lord I've got to commit my
[1:18:02] life over to the Lord from going to the
[1:18:03] service so then she began to serve the
[1:18:06] Lord over the course of time her sister
[1:18:07] passed away and she asked a man to come
[1:18:10] and officiate at the minister to come
[1:18:12] and officiate the funeral of his sister
[1:18:14] and this man Lee Richmond sorry Lee
[1:18:21] Richmond when he began talking with you
[1:18:25] he was taken back by how much he loved
[1:18:27] the Lord and and he started to find out
[1:18:29] about her life now she had began to get
[1:18:31] sick herself as well and for the last I
[1:18:34] think year or two of her life she was
[1:18:35] confined to her a chair she what she did
[1:18:37] was sit down and she could all she did
[1:18:40] was read the Bible all day so he was
[1:18:42] taken back by how much he knew about the
[1:18:43] scriptures because all she did all day
[1:18:45] every day was read the Bible and and
[1:18:47] even though she was and it had a
[1:18:49] terminal sickness here well she
[1:18:52] naturally should have been going
[1:18:53] negative she was so positive in here
[1:18:55] outlook and his service to the Lord was
[1:18:57] so positive that he was just taken back
[1:18:59] by how she would act and so he would he
[1:19:01] found out about her life and interviewed
[1:19:03] her and did a few different things and
[1:19:04] then she passed away and he wrote a book
[1:19:07] about her essentially just a little
[1:19:11] story of her life only a short book and
[1:19:12] nothing overly dramatic and out in terms
[1:19:16] of a testimony but there was something
[1:19:18] about the book that just
[1:19:19] caught on and inspired people and this
[1:19:22] book in 1828 by 1828 there were four
[1:19:28] million copies of this book in 19
[1:19:31] languages and it was estimated that they
[1:19:35] were and during the 1802 sort of 1900
[1:19:38] there are over ten million copies of
[1:19:40] this book that were printed and seen all
[1:19:41] around the world all different languages
[1:19:42] and there were thousands and thousands
[1:19:44] came to the Lord through the reading of
[1:19:45] this book of this Elizabeth Walbridge
[1:19:48] and no one really knows why they thought
[1:19:52] it's just an average story but in yet
[1:19:54] that had such a profound effect and it
[1:19:56] like people like the Queen of England
[1:19:58] she had read the book so she actually
[1:20:00] did a pilgrimage to the to the
[1:20:01] gravestone to see the grave of Elizabeth
[1:20:04] Walbridge now the reason why I told you
[1:20:06] that story was because when samuel
[1:20:09] marsden was in portsmouth as he does
[1:20:13] when he turns up to an area he efforts a
[1:20:15] sunday he thinks log on find a church to
[1:20:17] go and preaching because that's what I
[1:20:18] do I'm a minister so he went across to
[1:20:20] the Isle of Man and preached a sermon in
[1:20:23] this little church and it was Elizabeth
[1:20:25] Ward she was at she came to that sermon
[1:20:27] and it was assuming that he preached
[1:20:28] that that it that caused her conversion
[1:20:31] so when she says I went to a church and
[1:20:33] a minister preached and I was convicted
[1:20:35] that was samuel marsden preached that
[1:20:36] sermon and he assumed was called be
[1:20:40] clothed with humility I want to read you
[1:20:46] these here politically at the time there
[1:20:49] was a war with England and France so
[1:20:52] they had to if they were going to sail
[1:20:54] throughout the out of the kind of
[1:20:56] English area they had to wait for a
[1:20:58] convoy of ships to go together because
[1:21:00] they and and for the Navy to be with him
[1:21:01] because the ships were still being
[1:21:02] attacked so if they had a convoy of ten
[1:21:04] or fifteen ships it was going to be
[1:21:06] safer so they waited and ports mouths
[1:21:07] till all the ships were there and then
[1:21:10] they began the ESTs sailed on the comics
[1:21:13] ship to Australia I want to read this so
[1:21:15] you this is Samuel Marsden's diary so
[1:21:17] these are he has words so you start to
[1:21:19] get an idea of what he's like I'll just
[1:21:21] read you a few of these you probably
[1:21:23] can't see that 30th of September this
[1:21:26] morning the signal was given by the
[1:21:27] commander for all the ships under his
[1:21:29] convoy to weigh anchor and prepare for
[1:21:31] sea about nine o'clock the whole fleet
[1:21:33] was all under say
[1:21:33] which consisted of about 40 ships the
[1:21:35] one was really fear so we were quickly
[1:21:38] in the main ocean I was soon affected by
[1:21:40] the motion of the vessel I thought of
[1:21:41] brother Marty when I read this that's
[1:21:42] why I put it in here I was soon affected
[1:21:44] by the motion of the vessel this
[1:21:46] rendered me quite unfit for any
[1:21:48] religious duties so he sees basically I
[1:21:50] got seasick oh how miserable must be
[1:21:53] this state must this state be who have
[1:21:57] all their religion to seek when sickness
[1:21:59] and death come upon them Lord grant that
[1:22:01] this meant even be my case so he's
[1:22:03] saying well imagine if you get to a
[1:22:05] state of this disparate state or
[1:22:09] sickness or illness and you don't know
[1:22:10] the Lord I'd rather tune up in that
[1:22:12] state knowing the Lord because he was
[1:22:14] thinking now I'm so sick now so now he's
[1:22:21] on the ship and he and here's his words
[1:22:23] on a Sunday he says how different is a
[1:22:26] Sabbath from those that I formerly known
[1:22:28] when I could meet with the great
[1:22:29] congregation I longed for these means
[1:22:31] and privileges again oh when shall I
[1:22:33] come and appear before God yet it is a
[1:22:36] consolation to me but to believe that I
[1:22:38] am in the way of my duty I requested the
[1:22:41] captain today to give me permission to
[1:22:43] perform divine service to the ship's
[1:22:44] company let me have a church service to
[1:22:47] all of convicts he rather hesitated said
[1:22:50] he had never seen a religious sailor but
[1:22:52] at length promised to have service the
[1:22:54] following Sunday so he's on the ship and
[1:22:56] he's already saying to the captain let
[1:22:58] me run a it's a Sunday let me run a
[1:22:59] service captain said no I've never seen
[1:23:02] a religious sailor we've seen one
[1:23:04] haven't we
[1:23:04] brother Chris okay now the next Sunday
[1:23:09] comes around he says that this is his
[1:23:12] words the last Sabbath that kept them
[1:23:13] promised me I should have Liberty to
[1:23:14] perform divine service today but to my
[1:23:16] great mortification he now declines how
[1:23:19] unwilling are the unconverted to see
[1:23:20] anything of divine truth the next Sunday
[1:23:26] I rose this morning with a great desire
[1:23:28] to preach to the ship's company you did
[1:23:30] not know how I should be able to
[1:23:31] accomplish my wish we were now four
[1:23:33] ships and company so the other ships had
[1:23:35] left and gone different ways our captain
[1:23:37] had invited the captains belonging to
[1:23:39] the other three to dine with us today as
[1:23:40] soon as they came on board I mentioned
[1:23:42] my design to one of them to want to have
[1:23:46] a service who immediately comply
[1:23:47] with my wish and said he would mention
[1:23:49] it to our captain what she did and
[1:23:51] preparations were made for me to preach
[1:23:53] I read part of the church prayers and
[1:23:55] afterwards preached from the third
[1:23:56] chapter of st. John the fourteenth and
[1:23:58] fifteen verses as Moses lifted up the
[1:24:00] serpent in the wilderness etcetera
[1:24:02] the sailors stood on the main deck I and
[1:24:04] four captains upon the quarterdeck and
[1:24:06] they were a tentative and the good
[1:24:08] effects were apparent during the
[1:24:09] remainder of the day so he began having
[1:24:12] services every week on the ship after
[1:24:14] that now the journey from England to
[1:24:18] Australia on a sailing ship takes a long
[1:24:21] time about four or five months and they
[1:24:23] go from England down to Rio de Janeiro
[1:24:26] they stop there for supplies and things
[1:24:29] and then they go to Cape Town stop there
[1:24:30] and then around to Australia so it's
[1:24:33] it's a very long way and in December
[1:24:40] they arrive in Australia so it's past it
[1:24:42] but yes so that's right and this here
[1:24:47] just says he was happy to see the land
[1:24:48] now the first Sunday that he was there I
[1:24:52] want to read his diary what he said saw
[1:24:56] several persons at work as I went along
[1:24:59] so this is Sunday I saw several persons
[1:25:02] at work as I went along to whom I spake
[1:25:03] and warn them of the evil of Sabbath
[1:25:05] breaking you shouldn't be working on
[1:25:06] Sunday my mom was deeply affected with
[1:25:09] the wickedness I beheld going on as
[1:25:12] first service I spoke from the 6th
[1:25:14] chapter of Revelation behold the great
[1:25:16] day of his wrath has come and who shall
[1:25:17] be able to stand as I was returning home
[1:25:20] a young man followed me into the wood
[1:25:21] and told me how he was to stress for the
[1:25:23] salvation of a soul he seemed to
[1:25:25] manifest the strongest marks of
[1:25:26] contrition and to be truly awakened to a
[1:25:29] sense of this of his danger I hope the
[1:25:31] Lord will have many souls in this place
[1:25:35] when you read how he talks you start to
[1:25:38] see there's attitude was his heart was
[1:25:41] pure a lot of a secular world right the
[1:25:44] sky off and don't like him but I think
[1:25:47] differently of him now you know we see
[1:25:51] there was a senior chaplain he was the
[1:25:53] essentially the vice chaplain it was
[1:25:56] within six months maximum of a year I
[1:25:58] think that this man said he had to go
[1:26:00] back to the UK
[1:26:04] and then he was going to come back but
[1:26:05] he never had any intention of returning
[1:26:06] because I think the the the state of the
[1:26:11] area that he was trying to minister and
[1:26:13] became too much for him because all he
[1:26:16] was dealing with were criminals and
[1:26:19] trying to I don't know how much of
[1:26:20] contact the help with the aborigine
[1:26:22] people but the whole society was
[1:26:23] basically that from a British sense all
[1:26:26] the dregs of Britain was sent there and
[1:26:28] these guys had to try and run that I
[1:26:31] want to read this here the state of
[1:26:33] morals was utterly depraved as in don't
[1:26:36] know this word and were dishes lying
[1:26:37] with general marriage and the sacred
[1:26:39] secretaries of domestic life are almost
[1:26:41] unknown and those who from the station
[1:26:44] should have set an example to the comics
[1:26:46] and settlers encouraged sin and others
[1:26:47] by essentially doing it themselves so
[1:26:50] this man got so discouraged and one of
[1:26:54] Samuel Marsden's pieces of advice that
[1:26:58] he would always give to the mission
[1:26:59] group back in England cuz I would ask
[1:27:00] him Oh after you've been here for years
[1:27:02] and years they used to ask him advice of
[1:27:04] what they should do and one of the
[1:27:06] things he said was don't see anyone
[1:27:07] that's melancholy over to the mission
[1:27:09] field don't seem down as he said this is
[1:27:12] this place is hard it's rough it's tough
[1:27:14] if you're a downer you're gonna fail
[1:27:16] because you've got to be a go-getter
[1:27:18] you've got to be willing to get your
[1:27:19] hands dirty and all sorts of things and
[1:27:20] he said of this guy he was a bit of a
[1:27:22] melancholy downer so it all got too many
[1:27:24] years went home so that left samuel
[1:27:27] marsden essentially 30 years old in
[1:27:31] charge of the the christian welfare of
[1:27:33] this whole convict colony which that was
[1:27:35] never really his plan i think going into
[1:27:36] it now we need to end up the governor of
[1:27:42] the year because he was working for the
[1:27:44] government and him working for the crown
[1:27:46] the new rule was that because they were
[1:27:50] short-staffed i guess that the the
[1:27:54] chaplains had to also be magistrates so
[1:27:58] now he turns up and has caught this
[1:27:59] colony he wants to spread the gospel and
[1:28:02] share the Word of God and suddenly he
[1:28:03] gets tired now you also have to be a
[1:28:04] judge in anything that goes wrong they
[1:28:06] can be thrown before you and you've got
[1:28:07] a dish out some sort of whatever
[1:28:09] punishment is applicable to these guys
[1:28:14] that have put before you
[1:28:15] and that included here to dish out
[1:28:18] anything from floggings to even and that
[1:28:21] day they had the death penalty still
[1:28:22] even hangings and things like that and
[1:28:24] of course he refuses he said I didn't
[1:28:27] come here to I'm a minister I don't work
[1:28:30] in this field I'm a minister
[1:28:32] but his ties were such that he had to he
[1:28:36] essentially was a he worked for them
[1:28:38] missiles as boss and he just had to do
[1:28:40] the job he had to do and I think in
[1:28:41] those times you didn't really question
[1:28:43] the authority he just did what you had
[1:28:45] to do but he didn't like it and one man
[1:28:47] quoted that you know if you do both
[1:28:49] officers their detriment to each other
[1:28:51] you're basically ruin both you know you
[1:28:53] try be a minister one hand he's trying
[1:28:54] to minister to people in the other hand
[1:28:55] he might throw the same guy will flog
[1:28:57] the same guy the next day he got a
[1:29:00] reputation for being just but what the
[1:29:01] Australians call him the flogging person
[1:29:03] and they don't like him because they
[1:29:05] said I used to dish out all these
[1:29:06] floggings to to us he didn't want to he
[1:29:09] didn't wasn't interested in that job but
[1:29:10] he had to I want to tell you this just
[1:29:15] to get an get you in the mindset of what
[1:29:17] he had to start dealing with when he
[1:29:19] went there this was one of the hangings
[1:29:22] he had to go to a man Joseph Samuel and
[1:29:24] a few other people a policeman had been
[1:29:27] killed well he was trying to find out
[1:29:29] who stole some lady's belongings he was
[1:29:31] murdered and they got three men thinking
[1:29:35] that these three men did it one of the
[1:29:37] men on the the day before his trial they
[1:29:40] thought no he didn't do it so they put
[1:29:42] him they didn't hang him but two other
[1:29:44] men they were going to hang and one of
[1:29:48] them was Joseph Samuel and Joe I'm
[1:29:52] Samuel Marsden's job was actually to go
[1:29:53] there and talk with this man and pray
[1:29:56] with this man before I was going to be
[1:29:57] hung and you know say I don't think he
[1:30:01] expected to have to do this sort of job
[1:30:02] when he was going to go to a mission
[1:30:04] field but this was just his job and and
[1:30:07] but before they were going to hang this
[1:30:09] man Joseph Samuel he he said a statement
[1:30:13] like look I didn't do it when I was in
[1:30:15] prison last night with this other guy he
[1:30:16] confessed to it the guy that you guys
[1:30:17] leaked I know yeah he said the guy you
[1:30:19] guys did go he confessed to me that he
[1:30:20] did it and the crowd said I was that
[1:30:23] true and there was a bit of an uproar
[1:30:24] but they so then they realized will the
[1:30:27] other guy that's about to get hung he
[1:30:28] obvious
[1:30:28] didn't do it because you didn't say it
[1:30:29] was some so they let him go so they were
[1:30:31] just gonna hang this guy Joseph Samuel
[1:30:33] why himself and they they I guess I had
[1:30:38] the cart they hit the rope and they pull
[1:30:40] the cart away and they hung him in the
[1:30:42] rope snapped and so then they get the
[1:30:48] guy off the ground the the hangman ties
[1:30:50] the rope again makes another noose try
[1:30:53] and hang them again and the Rope comes
[1:30:54] loose and then they tie another rope put
[1:30:59] it up there put him on the cart
[1:31:00] pull the cart away and the Rope snaps
[1:31:02] again this rope is tested for guys twice
[1:31:05] three times his size and well this is
[1:31:08] all happening the crowd is saying well
[1:31:09] hang on he must be innocent he's not we
[1:31:11] can't he's not dying
[1:31:12] so they actually it was a bit of an
[1:31:14] uproar and they got the governor in and
[1:31:16] they gave him a pardon on on the grounds
[1:31:18] of divine interference God nice and then
[1:31:22] wanted him to die so we're gonna leave
[1:31:23] him alive so but Josey he was if you
[1:31:27] look at that top ten guys that they
[1:31:29] couldn't kill you know execute he was I
[1:31:31] think number three and samuel marsden
[1:31:33] happened to be there during the whole
[1:31:34] event and prayed with the guy and
[1:31:36] everything but this was the sort of
[1:31:37] activity here to be involved with being
[1:31:39] in Australia another thing that happened
[1:31:44] was the governor said that all the
[1:31:47] people that work for the government the
[1:31:48] magistrates these different ones they
[1:31:50] could be allocated 100 acres of land and
[1:31:53] they will be allocated half a dozen
[1:31:54] convicts to work the land for them
[1:31:56] essentially for free so samuel marsden
[1:31:59] took them up on this offer because he
[1:32:01] tells that when he got there there was
[1:32:03] no food there it was a in his toy house
[1:32:06] there was a wee bit of meat leaf but
[1:32:07] there was no there was no farming there
[1:32:08] was nothing going on so they were
[1:32:09] essentially people they were starving
[1:32:11] they didn't have farms and commerce
[1:32:13] happening and so he got a hundred acres
[1:32:16] of land and he began to work this land
[1:32:18] and he was successful in what he did was
[1:32:20] farming and it was well then well then
[1:32:23] about this is actually his house here
[1:32:26] that's one of his houses now the
[1:32:28] Australians and many people again
[1:32:30] criticize him because he became very
[1:32:31] wealthy he he ended up he would do so
[1:32:35] well working his farm that he would buy
[1:32:37] the next guy's hundred acres and in this
[1:32:38] one and that one and that one he ended
[1:32:40] up with about three thousand acres of
[1:32:41] land
[1:32:42] he had he was the first to export wool
[1:32:44] into England he he had he had crops he
[1:32:51] had vineyards he had fruit he was a he
[1:32:53] became very commercial in his way of
[1:32:54] doing things and that got him a lot of
[1:32:57] criticism as well because they said well
[1:32:58] you're a minister what are you doing and
[1:32:59] business and just making money you you
[1:33:01] and they get this concept like he's just
[1:33:03] gone over to Australia and you know
[1:33:05] making taking advantage of the whole
[1:33:09] situation I want to read you something
[1:33:12] that and I'll just explain something I
[1:33:14] want to read you something that this was
[1:33:15] a French sailor that went through and
[1:33:17] Samuel Marsden and saw what he had done
[1:33:19] on his farm in it and he said listen
[1:33:22] eight years ago the whole of the spot
[1:33:23] was covered with the mints in useless
[1:33:24] forests what pains what exertions must
[1:33:26] have been employed these roads these
[1:33:28] pastures these fields his harvest these
[1:33:29] orchards these flocks the work of eight
[1:33:31] years and his admiration of the scene
[1:33:33] was not greater than his reference to
[1:33:35] its owner who he adds well he thus
[1:33:37] labored and his various important
[1:33:38] evocations was not unmindful of the
[1:33:40] interests of others he generously
[1:33:42] interfered on behalf of the poorest
[1:33:44] settlers in the district establish
[1:33:45] schools for their children and often
[1:33:47] relieved their necessities and then he
[1:33:49] sang and he was also nice to the the
[1:33:50] aborigine people of the land he was also
[1:33:52] helped them and a lot of ways to help
[1:33:54] them to get things now you see why you
[1:33:59] can see why over time why the Lord bless
[1:34:01] them they will see why later on but he
[1:34:04] actually had to write letters out to
[1:34:06] rebuff claims that he was just over
[1:34:08] there to make money so one of his
[1:34:09] letters he wrote back was he said he
[1:34:11] said this he said I did not consider
[1:34:13] myself in the same situation and a
[1:34:14] temporal point of view and this colony
[1:34:17] as a clergyman in England my situation
[1:34:20] if I was in England at that period would
[1:34:22] be a no such comparison a clergyman in
[1:34:24] England lives in the very bosom of his
[1:34:26] friends his comforts and his
[1:34:28] conveniences are all within his reach
[1:34:29] and he has nothing to do but to feed his
[1:34:32] flock on the contrary I entered the
[1:34:34] country which was in a state of nature
[1:34:36] and was obliged to plant and sew or
[1:34:39] starve that was not from my desire that
[1:34:42] my colleague and I took to the ax the
[1:34:43] Spade in a hoe we could not from our
[1:34:46] situation help ourself or any other
[1:34:47] means st. Paul's own hands ministered to
[1:34:50] us necessities necessities in a
[1:34:52] cultivated nation and our hands
[1:34:54] ministered to our wants and an
[1:34:56] cultivated one if this be cast upon me
[1:34:58] as a shame and reproach I cheerfully
[1:35:00] Barrett for the remembrance never gives
[1:35:02] me any cause of reproach or remorse
[1:35:04] so saying look say what you want I got
[1:35:06] the room we were starving and I had to
[1:35:09] we either did this or we died that was
[1:35:12] it and the Lord just bless what he
[1:35:14] didn't he became very wealthy now you
[1:35:23] hear all this and you start to think
[1:35:24] even in a bad situation life is going up
[1:35:26] looking out for him he's got quite a
[1:35:28] good position and things like that but
[1:35:29] any minister of the gospel any real
[1:35:31] servant of God I call it a I'm not the
[1:35:38] mark of a minister but the the hallmarks
[1:35:45] almost of a minister explained like this
[1:35:47] Paul Paul the great minister we would
[1:35:51] think you know Paul had and he would
[1:35:52] have had he was he was called of God he
[1:35:54] should have had an easy life but he
[1:35:56] didn't and when he wrote and one of the
[1:35:58] and one of the scriptures he explained
[1:36:01] how I've been shipwrecked I've been
[1:36:03] beaten I've been robbed I've been a
[1:36:05] Piero's on the CP rolls on the lamp here
[1:36:06] was among false brethren
[1:36:08] I've been whupped stoned I've had all
[1:36:11] these things and he says from henceforth
[1:36:15] let no man trouble me for our beer my
[1:36:17] body the marks of the Lord Jesus anyone
[1:36:19] that really serves the Lord and has got
[1:36:21] a bigger calling in the Lord you'll find
[1:36:23] that the relative in relation to their
[1:36:24] calling oftentimes they have hardship of
[1:36:26] the same magnitude but you look at what
[1:36:28] brother Brennan went through with the
[1:36:30] loss of his family and things that you
[1:36:32] know that he has to beer and anytime you
[1:36:34] look into a minister if you start to see
[1:36:36] these things in their life you think
[1:36:38] okay this is I can see the Lord here I
[1:36:39] don't know what how it works but that's
[1:36:41] just a minister of someone that really
[1:36:44] serves the Lord doesn't get an easy lot
[1:36:45] in life now samuel marsden when he was
[1:36:50] they went there and they were getting
[1:36:52] set up he had a little family because he
[1:36:54] was married in england and he came back
[1:36:55] in his his wife was sitting on a horse
[1:36:58] and buggy like this and holding their
[1:37:00] little child is parked holding their two
[1:37:03] three-year-old baby and then the horse
[1:37:05] kicked and the baby flung out of your
[1:37:07] arms and fell on the ground in
[1:37:10] so he lost one of his children there and
[1:37:14] the like these words here that this book
[1:37:19] was written in 1850 so it was still
[1:37:20] relevant they still could catch this he
[1:37:23] said he received tidings together with
[1:37:25] the body of his lifeless boy doesn't
[1:37:27] when they brought this dead boy to him
[1:37:28] and we are told with calm and even
[1:37:30] dignified submission so he just took the
[1:37:33] baby the boy and he said for he was a
[1:37:35] man who said little girl he felt much so
[1:37:38] you can imagine you've got to go through
[1:37:40] that that was one of the hardships he
[1:37:43] had to go through maybe a year or two
[1:37:45] later three years to three years later
[1:37:48] because of the death of their first that
[1:37:51] one of their children the mother always
[1:37:52] tried to protect the other children to
[1:37:54] anything happening from them she was
[1:37:57] going she had to go out summer and she
[1:37:59] lift the lift the child home and she got
[1:38:01] someone in a maiden or someone to you
[1:38:03] know stay here with the child and look
[1:38:04] after them while I go out maybe they
[1:38:06] used to just leave them alone but she
[1:38:08] said you stay here and look after this
[1:38:09] child but well she was out the little
[1:38:14] child was playing in the in their house
[1:38:16] and then those times they headed these
[1:38:17] they would cook in an open fire
[1:38:19] essentially like this and have a boiled
[1:38:21] stuff over the fire with the pot on it
[1:38:23] and this little baby was playing around
[1:38:26] stumbled and fell into the boiling pot
[1:38:28] of water and died from that so he lost
[1:38:32] another child so he didn't have it easy
[1:38:36] and you think that you know that the
[1:38:38] struggle he would have had and as
[1:38:40] Christian walk because he you know
[1:38:41] that's the first one was hard enough
[1:38:43] losing another child and he was a man
[1:38:45] like we were here they loved his
[1:38:46] children so the by no means had it easy
[1:38:57] he would preach a lot preached in
[1:39:01] different parishes there's a saying that
[1:39:02] said I just want to read this about his
[1:39:06] his preaching is described as very plain
[1:39:08] full of good sense and manly thought and
[1:39:10] treating chiefly of the teaching
[1:39:14] truthfully of the great foundational
[1:39:16] truths of the gospel so there was
[1:39:18] nothing really flashy about it he just
[1:39:19] spoke the Word of God and he said those
[1:39:21] who came to hear a great preacher went
[1:39:23] away disappointed but those but those
[1:39:26] who came to pass like an hour of you
[1:39:28] know no conviction where sometimes
[1:39:30] grievously disturbed because he would
[1:39:32] just sort of preach it how it was
[1:39:33] nothing flesh there was a story that
[1:39:37] after one of his services he was walking
[1:39:39] along by the river and a man looked like
[1:39:44] he he jumped into the river and so
[1:39:46] Samuel being Samuel he the first thought
[1:39:48] was I've got to go and save this man
[1:39:50] from drowning so he jumped in the river
[1:39:51] to save this this man from drowning
[1:39:52] when he got there to pull a man out the
[1:39:56] man started wrestling with him and
[1:39:57] trying to drown him so he fought with
[1:40:00] his man in the river and Samuel being
[1:40:02] the stronger of the to manage to fight
[1:40:03] with him overtake him and then he
[1:40:06] dragged him back to the shore and pulled
[1:40:08] him out when the man got to the shore he
[1:40:11] confessed what his intention was he said
[1:40:12] he was a convict you see Dolls in church
[1:40:14] this morning and you were preaching and
[1:40:17] you must have known the things that I
[1:40:19] was going through and that and you were
[1:40:21] you were basically preaching about me
[1:40:22] and you were making fun of me in the
[1:40:24] congregation you were singing me out
[1:40:26] making fun of me and so I will came here
[1:40:28] to I knew that if I went and jumped in
[1:40:31] the river you'd jump after me that I was
[1:40:32] going to drown you because that's what
[1:40:34] you you did that to me this man was
[1:40:37] converted here she became a big help to
[1:40:39] Samuel Marsden
[1:40:40] through throughout their work there so
[1:40:42] he had an effect as minute his preaching
[1:40:45] that may have been plain and very bland
[1:40:47] it hadn't effect on people and maybe
[1:40:49] that's the way little wanted it because
[1:40:50] of the people he was amongst were very
[1:40:52] just bland plain probably tough people
[1:40:55] you know he it was the other thing that
[1:41:00] he would do when he was there was he
[1:41:01] would not only preach in his main
[1:41:03] churches that he had but he would do two
[1:41:05] to three week essentially circuit write
[1:41:07] writing preaching as well the circuit
[1:41:10] writing preacher you would call it that
[1:41:11] so he would write for go out maybe 20
[1:41:13] kilometers turn up and say I want to run
[1:41:16] a church service here and so that the
[1:41:17] people of that area would go out about
[1:41:19] 12 kilometer radius and gather about 60
[1:41:21] people to come and have church and they
[1:41:23] would run a church service there and
[1:41:24] then he would ride for another 25
[1:41:26] kilometers which was you know 12 within
[1:41:28] 12 cows out he would call them and they
[1:41:30] would have a church service see and he
[1:41:31] would ride around all the district
[1:41:33] sometimes for two or three weeks holding
[1:41:35] these church services and he became
[1:41:38] essentially a household name amongst and
[1:41:39] the area where he was and anytime that
[1:41:42] he would leave to go back to England for
[1:41:44] a period of time he would always hit
[1:41:45] there would always be a big congregation
[1:41:49] of people sending him off because he he
[1:41:50] garnered a lot of respect and the
[1:41:52] different with his ministry with his
[1:41:54] business things with us even as judged
[1:41:57] his Magistrate work he actually
[1:41:58] respected him a lot he had a good
[1:42:00] reputation I'll tell you the story
[1:42:04] because it's um this just kind of points
[1:42:08] out that sort of guy he was he he would
[1:42:10] have to write to from Port Jackson to
[1:42:12] Parramatta you know maybe fifteen
[1:42:13] kilometres often to go and preach and do
[1:42:15] different things and a few of his horses
[1:42:18] he had these they said no one else could
[1:42:20] handle his horses but when he would have
[1:42:21] them he'll be fine but what he would do
[1:42:23] is he would be in his little horse and
[1:42:25] buggy like this and he would get on the
[1:42:27] road and then I don't know what you do
[1:42:29] giddyup horsey let the reins go and just
[1:42:32] read the reader paper I read a book
[1:42:34] whatever for the 15 kilometres didn't
[1:42:37] drive his horses because he said any
[1:42:38] horse that just can't go beyond its own
[1:42:39] is not worth me having say-so he wasn't
[1:42:42] he didn't want to have to steer sources
[1:42:43] he just said you go let me know when
[1:42:45] we're home and that was there was just
[1:42:47] the way that he was something about him
[1:42:51] now we've got to cover these things
[1:42:56] because it starts to tie the story
[1:42:58] together of we're going to get to New
[1:43:00] Zealand who knows about whalers these
[1:43:05] men and this period of time were
[1:43:09] borderline on crazy the things that
[1:43:11] these men did whalers catching whales
[1:43:13] out in the middle of the ocean they went
[1:43:15] in their little boats and they would
[1:43:17] harpoon these things and these whales
[1:43:18] would tow them along and then they would
[1:43:20] have other boats and spear these massive
[1:43:22] whales
[1:43:23] and at the time when joseph samuel
[1:43:26] marsden was there that the whaling
[1:43:28] industry was becoming more and more
[1:43:30] popular and they would use the sperm
[1:43:32] whale oil forum user for cooking but
[1:43:34] also for I'm burning the lanterns and
[1:43:36] things and making wax because it was an
[1:43:37] odorless oil and it had a lot of uses
[1:43:40] for it so they would his men would kill
[1:43:42] these whales and get the oil out of it
[1:43:44] and different things and it was quite a
[1:43:45] big industry but hard rough work and the
[1:43:48] sort of people that did it were just
[1:43:50] hard rough type of people the Whalers
[1:43:56] more of these guys here this the the
[1:43:58] ventures that these men did but they
[1:44:01] were also just rough ungodly men that
[1:44:04] was just the character of these men
[1:44:05] probably nice men good but just rough
[1:44:08] now in 1791 I think it was a French
[1:44:13] Whaler they discovered he went around
[1:44:16] New Zealand and discovered that there
[1:44:17] were a lot of whales around New Zealand
[1:44:19] so he started he wailed around there for
[1:44:24] a bit did some whaling and then of
[1:44:26] course six months later once he's gone
[1:44:28] back to where he was going from he tells
[1:44:30] the people about New Zealand here there
[1:44:31] was a lot of whales around there and it
[1:44:33] was good whaling and so from that time
[1:44:35] what the ships will do the ships would
[1:44:37] come down and drop the convicts often
[1:44:39] and Sydney where similar wasn't in they
[1:44:41] would that would be their main port and
[1:44:43] then they would go across the Pacific in
[1:44:45] whale all around New Zealand catching
[1:44:46] whales and if they dream for months and
[1:44:51] months they for a time hit to go into
[1:44:53] Shore and and they would actually start
[1:44:54] going on shore and trading with the
[1:44:55] merry people in different parts of New
[1:44:57] Zealand to get water get supplies give
[1:44:59] them this for that and just do nothing
[1:45:01] major but just general trades of things
[1:45:03] like that so the Whalers started making
[1:45:05] contact with different parts of New
[1:45:07] Zealand I found these is a few little
[1:45:09] photos this is later on so this is at
[1:45:10] that time it was very small low-key but
[1:45:13] I found this one interesting because
[1:45:15] there was a potted or whaling station so
[1:45:17] they would come in here but this was
[1:45:18] more in the 1830s and 40s but
[1:45:33] now the they would have contact with the
[1:45:37] merry people and what would happen was
[1:45:39] the Mary's became interested in these
[1:45:41] guys and where are we where are you
[1:45:42] going
[1:45:42] and so over time that a lot of the merry
[1:45:45] people would hop on these whaling boats
[1:45:46] and sail around I've got a picture here
[1:45:49] I just want to touch on this this
[1:45:51] picture I've got here for a second this
[1:45:53] is this is Russell up and the bay of
[1:45:55] islands this became a popular area this
[1:45:57] may be it's the location of where it was
[1:45:59] the harbour it was just a it was
[1:46:01] sheltered it was just where a lot of the
[1:46:03] whaling was in the ships were coming in
[1:46:05] this was an 18 36 but I mean it's kind
[1:46:09] of fast forward a few 50 years just to
[1:46:11] tell you this part of the story whale is
[1:46:13] being whale as they would they were just
[1:46:15] ungodly people they would eventually
[1:46:16] Russell was just a pit of these guys
[1:46:21] came in with the alcohol with the
[1:46:23] prostitution with everything and they
[1:46:24] were just with with the merry people and
[1:46:26] it was all it was just a Charles Darwin
[1:46:31] of all people he went to Russell and he
[1:46:34] coined it and it still it's got this old
[1:46:36] still called this to the today if you
[1:46:38] research it it was called he called it
[1:46:40] the hellhole of the Pacific he said
[1:46:43] don't go to that decrepit place is just
[1:46:44] full of debauchery and drunkenness and
[1:46:46] fighting and so that was the influence
[1:46:48] of whalers head and it's you know that's
[1:46:51] the kingdom of Satan just getting in
[1:46:52] there you know what here was the kingdom
[1:46:56] of God trying to come into the place and
[1:46:57] at the same time the Satan's inning has
[1:46:59] missing there but we digress so now as a
[1:47:04] result of the merry people hopping on
[1:47:05] the ships in doing whaling and suddenly
[1:47:07] being one of the main ports that the
[1:47:09] Whalers would come back to and and pick
[1:47:11] up things and go back to England over
[1:47:13] time Sam you'll meet a lot of merry
[1:47:14] people on the ships that would come in
[1:47:16] and they would stay for a month or two
[1:47:18] three and he had a lot of contact with
[1:47:20] him and he actually he began to greatly
[1:47:22] he had a genuine respect for the way
[1:47:24] that they were and he wrote a letter to
[1:47:27] one man and he said I'm very anxious for
[1:47:29] the instruction of the New Zealanders
[1:47:31] which was a Mary's they are a noble race
[1:47:33] vastly superior and understanding to
[1:47:35] anything you could can imagine any cause
[1:47:37] of this but the savage nation could
[1:47:39] attain to so he's making contact with
[1:47:41] the Mary's and saying these guys are
[1:47:42] smart and clever and he picked he picked
[1:47:44] up very early that they were they
[1:47:46] displayed on to
[1:47:47] Commerce works and they would start
[1:47:48] doing deals and all sorts of things in
[1:47:50] and he but he had genuine respect for
[1:47:52] the for them s of people which I think
[1:47:54] was helped him and his motives towards
[1:47:57] him now he went back to England he has a
[1:48:05] desire now he wants to send missionaries
[1:48:07] to New Zealand so this is Samuels desire
[1:48:09] he wants to he's in Australia and he
[1:48:12] wants to send missionaries to New
[1:48:13] Zealand so he goes back to England and I
[1:48:17] think he was here for a few years trying
[1:48:18] to sort this out and he gets a few men
[1:48:20] one called Thomas Kindle another man
[1:48:21] called William Hall and a bunch of them
[1:48:23] he arranges all US and their intention
[1:48:26] is they're gonna go back to Australia
[1:48:27] and then Thomas hall and William Thomas
[1:48:30] Kindle and William hall are going to go
[1:48:31] to New Zealand and mission is over there
[1:48:36] I'm not gonna read this one now I want
[1:48:42] to tell you another story this man was
[1:48:44] called there were different spellings of
[1:48:47] his name but Roth IRA and this man was
[1:48:51] from the Bay of Islands he was a chief
[1:48:52] quite young but he was a chief from the
[1:48:54] Bay of Islands and he had a when the
[1:48:58] whaling ships would come through and go
[1:49:00] into the port he had a desire to do an
[1:49:03] OE so he hopped on a whaling ship called
[1:49:05] the Argo and just away they went and
[1:49:08] they they they worked all around for
[1:49:13] about five months getting whale oil and
[1:49:14] different things then after five months
[1:49:18] he was dropped off in Sydney and the the
[1:49:22] ship just dropped them off there and
[1:49:23] didn't Pam just lift him there and he
[1:49:26] this is often how the Mary people got
[1:49:29] treated on these ships not all the time
[1:49:31] but it was quite common you know they
[1:49:32] would abuse them and then just drop them
[1:49:33] off and don't pay them so this was one
[1:49:34] of them men they didn't pay and then he
[1:49:38] managed to find another whaling ship to
[1:49:39] bring him back to the Bay of Islands and
[1:49:41] the next ship was called the the L
[1:49:44] beyond and the captain of this was a
[1:49:47] good man and he took him they did the
[1:49:49] whaling venture and then when they got
[1:49:50] back to the Bay of Islands he paid him
[1:49:52] all of the money he was jus paid him
[1:49:54] everything and drop them off and they
[1:49:55] carried on about six months later there
[1:49:58] was another ship called the Santa Anna
[1:49:59] came through the battle
[1:50:01] and wrote our I wanted to do another
[1:50:04] venture so he hopped on the Santa Ana
[1:50:06] and the plan for that this ship was they
[1:50:08] were going to sail to the Norfolk Island
[1:50:11] and drop some men off there and they
[1:50:13] were going to hunt seals for a while
[1:50:16] well the Santa N and went back to New
[1:50:17] Zealand picked up supplies and then they
[1:50:18] were going to come back pick them up and
[1:50:20] they're never going to hit two actually
[1:50:21] England after that because this this man
[1:50:24] wanted to admit a lot of these Western
[1:50:26] the British people he wanted to go and
[1:50:27] see the chief I want to go to England
[1:50:29] see the chief that's what he said the
[1:50:32] king take me to see the chief so so now
[1:50:37] here they were dropped off on the
[1:50:38] Chatham Islands but they were there was
[1:50:40] about twelve or thirteen of these men
[1:50:42] they were given very few supplies before
[1:50:45] this time the Chatham Islands was
[1:50:46] actually set up as a convict colony for
[1:50:48] Australia but over time it they realized
[1:50:51] it wasn't going to work so they they
[1:50:52] abandoned it so they were still a old
[1:50:54] abandoned structures there from when it
[1:50:55] was a convict colony but for a period of
[1:50:58] about thirty years it was there's nobody
[1:51:00] there so they tune up on this island
[1:51:01] that I don't think they had water they
[1:51:03] had to get it from the Rana they didn't
[1:51:04] have running water Springs and things so
[1:51:09] these men were there they had very few
[1:51:10] supplies and the Santa Ana on the way
[1:51:14] back from New Zealand got caught in the
[1:51:15] storm and it was delayed by a few months
[1:51:17] so these these men had to live on this
[1:51:20] island for about three months and
[1:51:22] survival and basically seal in birds for
[1:51:24] three months and and he it was a rough
[1:51:27] time two of the Europeans died and one
[1:51:31] Ty Heaton man died just through
[1:51:32] starvation on this island the Santa Ana
[1:51:35] finally turned up there and and took
[1:51:37] these meant that picked him up and they
[1:51:39] went all the way back to the UK so this
[1:51:42] man finally was a little merry man from
[1:51:45] the Bay of Islands in as in the UK to go
[1:51:47] and see the chief but he wasn't allowed
[1:51:50] to see the chief they said no you can't
[1:51:52] go and see the king you know we don't
[1:51:53] work like that and he can't just walk in
[1:51:55] and see him and and they were quite mean
[1:51:56] to him near they just left him on the
[1:51:57] ship they wouldn't let him go into
[1:51:59] London and explore and then after a few
[1:52:00] weeks they said oh and you're gonna be
[1:52:02] getting on this other ship and going
[1:52:03] back to Sydney on this other ship and he
[1:52:06] asked him once again about my pay
[1:52:07] where's my pay I've been working for six
[1:52:09] months and this man refused to pay me
[1:52:11] just drop them off on the other ship no
[1:52:12] pay they will pay you and some muskets
[1:52:14] when you get to
[1:52:15] he said they left him on the ship now
[1:52:19] that ship he got onto it was the same
[1:52:21] ship that samuel marsden and his same
[1:52:23] convict ship that they were all going
[1:52:25] back to england on and well semia was on
[1:52:28] the ship he recognized this this Mary
[1:52:31] guy that was working the ship and he saw
[1:52:33] that his words where he was almost like
[1:52:35] he was look so sad and down and
[1:52:37] depressed and looked like he was almost
[1:52:38] going to die look like in a few days
[1:52:39] this man's going to die and so him being
[1:52:42] how many he a he liked the Mary people
[1:52:44] and be he was a compassionate man he
[1:52:46] went up to him I said why why do you
[1:52:48] look so how are you waiter what's wrong
[1:52:51] with you and so this man explained them
[1:52:54] all of his story what happened to him
[1:52:55] and he also said look the sailors would
[1:52:57] beat me all the time that's when he
[1:52:58] would coffee would cough up blood and
[1:53:00] things like that and he would have had
[1:53:01] bruisings and there he explained to them
[1:53:03] the mistreatment and Samuels own words I
[1:53:11] won't read that he actually he wanted to
[1:53:14] go and get the captain over the southern
[1:53:16] ship and he said if I could I would go
[1:53:18] and see him and say why have you treated
[1:53:19] this man like this but he was already
[1:53:21] he'd already left the shore so he
[1:53:23] couldn't he couldn't do that but he he
[1:53:26] assured this man he said I want to look
[1:53:28] after you he he told the captain we're
[1:53:30] not gonna have this man working we're
[1:53:31] gonna he can stop working we're gonna
[1:53:32] he's got to be looked after so they they
[1:53:35] looked after him for a you know the
[1:53:36] duration of the trip and he became very
[1:53:39] healthy and then they they got back to
[1:53:43] Australia and he stayed there for about
[1:53:45] eight months with Samuel Marsden he
[1:53:46] taught him the English he learnt
[1:53:48] different trades and they became quite
[1:53:50] good friends and he was very healthy
[1:53:52] after that and so after about eight
[1:53:53] months they were going to send him back
[1:53:56] to New Zealand so he hopped on a ship to
[1:53:57] go back to New Zealand and the ship that
[1:54:01] he went on to go back to New Zealand
[1:54:03] didn't drop him off in New Zealand they
[1:54:05] wailed around they drove a few
[1:54:08] kilometres past his the Bay of Islands
[1:54:10] and then they carried on to Norfolk
[1:54:12] Island and they dropped him off at North
[1:54:13] Oak Island just lift him there and
[1:54:14] carried on and he almost died again at
[1:54:17] Norfolk Island a whaling ship came in
[1:54:19] and picked them up from Norfolk Island
[1:54:21] when they saw him there and they took
[1:54:23] him back to Sydney again so he's still
[1:54:25] not back in his New Zealand and so CNE
[1:54:27] went back to
[1:54:29] suddenly found CMOS and again he helped
[1:54:31] him out again to get well then he hopped
[1:54:33] on another ship and this time he made it
[1:54:34] back to New Zealand so that was Samuels
[1:54:37] connection with this man he played a
[1:54:39] significant role in and bringing the
[1:54:40] gospel to New Zealand so they got him
[1:54:43] back to New Zealand now the plan was for
[1:54:48] these men to leave Australia and Garbi
[1:54:50] missionaries in New Zealand at the time
[1:54:55] they were different there was mission
[1:54:57] work going on around the Pacific and
[1:54:59] that the the two that Samuel wasn't
[1:55:01] three that Samuel was involved in was
[1:55:03] Australia trying to get people to New
[1:55:05] Zealand and Tahiti of all places
[1:55:06] so Tahiti is in the middle of nowhere
[1:55:09] and missionaries families were going
[1:55:11] over and just living on tahi and trying
[1:55:13] to spread the gospel there that wasn't
[1:55:15] successful at the start and a few of the
[1:55:17] men actually came back and were quite
[1:55:19] down and they stable semua for about
[1:55:20] eight months and he sent them back again
[1:55:21] to carry on the mission I want to tell
[1:55:26] you something that happened about that
[1:55:27] same time which changed the nature of
[1:55:29] the plan what they wanted to do is
[1:55:31] anyone who have the burning of the Boyd
[1:55:35] this is a this was a ship a trading
[1:55:38] whaling ship that turned up in the Bay
[1:55:40] of Islands and now that you know the
[1:55:43] story of sometimes how that the merry
[1:55:44] people were treated on ships there was a
[1:55:46] son of a chief that had gone whaling on
[1:55:48] this ship and done things and they
[1:55:50] mistreated him a lot on the ship and he
[1:55:54] had convinced him because he was angry
[1:55:57] this men for the way had been treated so
[1:55:59] he convinced him that this is the best
[1:56:01] way to pull into this Bay over here and
[1:56:03] his plan was when they pull him the bay
[1:56:06] he said we'll go and we'll get supplies
[1:56:07] in it but it was his own it was his
[1:56:09] people he was going to go there and tell
[1:56:11] them what had happened and they were
[1:56:12] going to come in and get you to revenge
[1:56:14] on these people and wipe them out so
[1:56:17] they said to the captain he will come on
[1:56:20] board it will take you and a few men up
[1:56:22] and we'll take you and I'll go and meet
[1:56:25] the Chiefs and we'll sort things out for
[1:56:26] you we'll trade so he took it the
[1:56:27] captain and it first mate in different
[1:56:29] ones up took them up the bush a bit and
[1:56:30] when they went up there the marys killed
[1:56:32] them and ate them because they were
[1:56:34] cannibals I have to tell this because
[1:56:36] this is so they kill them and eat them
[1:56:38] and then they dress up in their clothes
[1:56:41] and then they row the boat
[1:56:43] out there to to the captain and his
[1:56:45] first mate a going back out to the the
[1:56:47] boy there's about 70 people men women
[1:56:49] children on there and so they they come
[1:56:51] back to this this boat they get on there
[1:56:53] at night and they one by one start
[1:56:55] killing all the people on the ship one
[1:56:58] of the time people are trying to escape
[1:56:59] up the mast dive into the water they
[1:57:01] were canoes around and they they killed
[1:57:04] about 70 drag them on the shore ate most
[1:57:08] of them the ones that there was a few
[1:57:10] they kept as slaves
[1:57:13] three days prisoners what well this was
[1:57:16] happen the next day another ship that
[1:57:19] were Mary Walker came in a canoe and he
[1:57:22] realized what was happening and he tried
[1:57:23] to it he was he liked to trade with the
[1:57:25] Europeans he tried to stop it but he
[1:57:27] wasn't really successful but as a result
[1:57:32] of that the people that got caught saw
[1:57:34] him they actually word got out that this
[1:57:36] men because he was a more prominent
[1:57:38] chief he was the one that killed all
[1:57:39] these people
[1:57:39] that's important part of the story but
[1:57:41] he was from a tribe not far down in the
[1:57:44] bay he tried to stop at videos
[1:57:46] unsuccessful after that another when
[1:57:50] word got out what happened another ship
[1:57:52] came in from the UK and they wanted to
[1:57:54] take revenge on these people and they'd
[1:57:55] heard that it was this guy from this
[1:57:56] tribe that did it so they turned up
[1:57:58] there they went to that tribe killed the
[1:58:00] chief and had a war with them and they
[1:58:01] killed about 30 or 40 of this other
[1:58:03] tribe which that tribe didn't do it this
[1:58:05] other tribe did they killed about 30 or
[1:58:07] 40 of them and and went away again to
[1:58:09] get revenge on on the burning of the
[1:58:11] Boyd and that started a war between
[1:58:14] these two tribes because this one tribe
[1:58:16] said well we got killed we didn't do
[1:58:18] anything it was you guys that did it now
[1:58:20] we got killed for us they started
[1:58:21] fighting amongst themselves so this is
[1:58:22] two tribes close to each other now this
[1:58:26] the man that from the other tribe was
[1:58:29] t-party 'no he was a he was a good
[1:58:31] person they actually all were and samuel
[1:58:34] they'll tell you this so now word got
[1:58:37] out that that the ship had been burnt
[1:58:40] all the people killed and eaten and from
[1:58:43] there people basically said no one go to
[1:58:45] that god forsaken country all the
[1:58:47] whaling stopped everything stopped
[1:58:49] people stopped going there because they
[1:58:50] said don't go near those cannibals they
[1:58:52] just you'll turn up there and they'll
[1:58:53] kill you and eat you that was the
[1:58:55] reputation that New Zealand had after
[1:58:56] burning of the Boyd now they'd also put
[1:59:00] a bit of a hindrance on the plans of
[1:59:03] these to see missionaries to New Zealand
[1:59:05] because the two missionaries that we're
[1:59:06] going to go there suddenly didn't want
[1:59:07] to go there anymore because you know
[1:59:09] these guys just been killed and eaten we
[1:59:10] don't want to go there but Samuel still
[1:59:12] wanted to go because he said hang on no
[1:59:14] no I think what happened was they
[1:59:16] mistreated that guy and they just now
[1:59:19] this coming from a judge that's quite
[1:59:20] intense but he said they not like they
[1:59:22] deserved it but hey they probably
[1:59:24] mistreated in what they mistreated this
[1:59:25] guy and they just took revenge on him so
[1:59:27] he looked at it from more of a different
[1:59:30] perspective it didn't deter his thoughts
[1:59:32] about them because he said these the
[1:59:33] great people they probably just were
[1:59:35] must treated this why they did what they
[1:59:36] did not saying it was right but he saw
[1:59:38] possible he said now I still want to go
[1:59:40] there and and but two things that
[1:59:42] happened the first thing that happened
[1:59:44] was he asked his the government the
[1:59:46] Europe he could go to and be gone on a
[1:59:48] mission trip to New Zealand
[1:59:49] and they said no way the last guys have
[1:59:51] all been killed
[1:59:52] there was no way you're going to go on a
[1:59:53] mission trip to New Zealand cuz he said
[1:59:54] if we're going to go the owner be the
[1:59:56] first one that turns up - if there's any
[1:59:57] danger I'll face it because he he also
[1:59:59] knew one of the minis so he thought I'll
[2:00:01] be accountant I know this man that's
[2:00:02] part of the tribe one of the Chiefs they
[2:00:04] said no the second thing they had was
[2:00:07] they couldn't find a ship that was
[2:00:09] willing to sails in New Zealand and
[2:00:10] bring them into the bay of islands
[2:00:11] couldn't find it kept into sailor's ship
[2:00:13] because they said the last ship that
[2:00:15] went they got burnt so they couldn't
[2:00:16] find a ship that someone was the one
[2:00:20] captain was going to go there and he was
[2:00:22] going to charge them exorbitant amounts
[2:00:23] just to to sail over there and
[2:00:26] seamlessly we can't afford to pay that
[2:00:27] that's that's just as ridiculous that
[2:00:29] was extortion so they had this
[2:00:31] hinderance so I have a guess what Sam
[2:00:33] you did I like this but because this is
[2:00:38] the sort of guy he was because he's also
[2:00:41] bearing in mind he's got this mission
[2:00:42] and Tahiti that he needs to get to as
[2:00:45] well you want so so he's got he's got
[2:00:48] these he's got a problem where he's got
[2:00:50] no ship and he's got these remote places
[2:00:52] that he wants to spread the gospel to
[2:00:54] New Zealand B he wants to help the
[2:00:55] people in Tahiti so he went out and
[2:00:58] bought him a ship that's what he did and
[2:01:03] he explained to his friend he said me
[2:01:05] buying of the ship has put me in a small
[2:01:07] amount of financial hardship but we
[2:01:09] should be right after a while
[2:01:12] now these this was an expensive sure
[2:01:15] penny I imagine he used most of his
[2:01:16] living to buy the ship because he had
[2:01:18] tried to ask the people back in the UK
[2:01:20] we need to help me out why should we
[2:01:21] need to get to these places we can't
[2:01:23] just leave him cut off he didn't get
[2:01:25] much of a response or anything so he
[2:01:26] said to them look I've just brought
[2:01:28] onboard a ship myself I'll do this thing
[2:01:30] myself so he bought the ship it was
[2:01:32] called the active be active now he still
[2:01:39] wasn't allowed to go on the first trip
[2:01:40] there but the two men it was a few of
[2:01:46] them at these were the main men that
[2:01:48] went now he had told him when you get to
[2:01:52] the bay of islands go and see this man
[2:01:54] writer I wasn't I think that was his
[2:01:56] name you know the man that he'd seen on
[2:01:58] the ship go and see him and they said
[2:02:01] when you get there
[2:02:02] give him Sam you gave from a wheat
[2:02:05] grinder he said give from this weak
[2:02:06] minded when you get there though these
[2:02:08] this is an interesting story but before
[2:02:12] this man live for his last trip to New
[2:02:13] Zealand when he actually finally made it
[2:02:15] Samuel gave him some wheat and he said
[2:02:18] you wanna grow this and this will you
[2:02:20] know because he saw the sky was quite
[2:02:21] commercial and of interest and his way
[2:02:23] of thinking so he gave him some wheat
[2:02:24] amongst other things and so this man
[2:02:27] this this man turns up in the Bay of
[2:02:29] Islands he's got this wheat seed and he
[2:02:31] grows all US wheat and he's telling the
[2:02:33] people this is this is you know those
[2:02:34] biscuits and things you eat on that
[2:02:36] you've you've heard from the Whalers and
[2:02:37] the bread this is from that comes from
[2:02:40] this and they said no you're crazy it
[2:02:41] doesn't come from that yes it does I'll
[2:02:43] show you
[2:02:43] so they started growing this wheat now
[2:02:46] the first thing as it started coming up
[2:02:48] the the people in the tribe out of
[2:02:50] curiosity went to eat the wheat so they
[2:02:52] pull it out of the ground to eat the
[2:02:53] roots because all the other food came
[2:02:55] from the roots
[2:02:56] you know like bulbs and things you know
[2:02:58] that he plan your roots and fern Bracken
[2:03:02] roots so they started pulling out his
[2:03:03] wheat well there's you can't eat this
[2:03:05] he's no no no it's the the wheat comes
[2:03:08] on top you gotta wait for it to come on
[2:03:09] top no no so it grew and he harvested
[2:03:14] this wheat but he then tried to grind up
[2:03:20] the sweet but he didn't have a grinder
[2:03:21] we tried to use a coffee grinder but
[2:03:22] nothing worked to grind this wheat
[2:03:24] strange a he they don't know why but you
[2:03:27] didn't think of like getting a mortal
[2:03:28] and pestle and grinding it but he
[2:03:29] couldn't actually grind this wheat and
[2:03:32] so he couldn't show them that this is
[2:03:34] actually weak that you eat that make the
[2:03:35] biscuits in the bread and so he became a
[2:03:37] bit of a joke like oh this guy tries to
[2:03:39] tell us that it's you know the stuffs
[2:03:41] what makes the biscuits and yeah you
[2:03:42] know so they took the sweet and stored
[2:03:44] it away because it was dry so his
[2:03:47] reputation I guess had he was kind of
[2:03:50] like the laughing stock in a sense
[2:03:51] because he'd even told him about horses
[2:03:52] is here man there are these big
[2:03:53] creatures and means sit on them and ride
[2:03:55] around
[2:03:56] no no no he would tell him about fruits
[2:03:59] and they said no no so so he was
[2:04:02] probably the crazy guy even though he
[2:04:03] was a chief he was the crazy guy in the
[2:04:04] village now these men turn up there and
[2:04:09] they specifically ask for arturro can we
[2:04:11] go up we want to see him and he knows
[2:04:13] that they he says look we're from Samuel
[2:04:15] we want to come and see you now the
[2:04:17] Samuel said to the people and the
[2:04:20] government and Australia if these men
[2:04:22] can go there and if they're safe and if
[2:04:24] they can bring some Chiefs back with
[2:04:25] them then you've got to let me go on the
[2:04:27] second trip back their company be more
[2:04:29] back with the Chiefs and they agreed to
[2:04:31] those terms if the men returned back
[2:04:32] alive and if they've got some of the
[2:04:33] Chiefs with him then they can accompany
[2:04:35] you back so they're meeting this men
[2:04:37] they meet this man rather and they and
[2:04:40] and then they say oh by the way Joseph
[2:04:44] told us Samuel told us to give you this
[2:04:47] some present here this week grinder this
[2:04:49] is for you and he said wow this is what
[2:04:52] I needed so he goes and gets all the
[2:04:54] wheat puts it in the grinder and grinds
[2:04:56] all the sweet and makes his flour and
[2:04:58] they quickly baked some cakes some bread
[2:05:00] and all the Mary's eat the bread and
[2:05:02] they say he was right this is true this
[2:05:04] is wheat and he became a hero overnight
[2:05:07] and they so he said look so they
[2:05:09] suddenly believed anything Neda said
[2:05:10] they were like well we should listen to
[2:05:12] what he says and he said look these mean
[2:05:13] a good mean this is you know we need to
[2:05:15] actually invite these men and they're
[2:05:17] good and so that little incident
[2:05:18] actually a little wheat grinder it gave
[2:05:23] that man a lot of esteem amoxil so they
[2:05:25] were basically listen to anything you
[2:05:27] see now so seed he said yeah it'll be
[2:05:28] safe we can all go back on the ship few
[2:05:30] of us will go back we'll go back to
[2:05:31] Australia then we'll go and pick him up
[2:05:33] samuel up because he told them about
[2:05:35] Samuel and we'll take him back over here
[2:05:36] and you'll like SEMA he's a good man so
[2:05:38] so the fame of Samuel amongst that tribe
[2:05:44] had already spread like they already
[2:05:46] knew him before he went there as a good
[2:05:48] person he'd already had quite a high
[2:05:49] reputation because of the help he'd
[2:05:51] already done too not just some but a lot
[2:05:53] of people that went there he helped out
[2:05:55] and sent them back so this was his
[2:05:58] reputation went before him so now they
[2:06:02] went back to Australia and now you can
[2:06:05] imagine Samuel Samuel when you start to
[2:06:10] see his life you think you know when he
[2:06:11] was just a clergyman in England or
[2:06:13] standing in the in the ministry and he
[2:06:15] thinks you know I'm just gonna be a
[2:06:16] minister I'm gonna go and have a church
[2:06:18] somewhere and preach the gospel and have
[2:06:20] my family and you know we're just going
[2:06:21] to do this thing his life was vastly
[2:06:24] different to what he expected even going
[2:06:26] on the mission field I'm gonna go on a
[2:06:27] mission field all he ended up with were
[2:06:30] British and Irish convicts that he's
[2:06:31] trying to minister to he's hearing to
[2:06:35] flog them
[2:06:35] he's even the guard of business and do
[2:06:37] all these different things you know you
[2:06:38] think tweet he is down the track 14
[2:06:40] years he's saying man I would not have
[2:06:42] thought that this was the mission field
[2:06:44] I was getting a gun you know this is
[2:06:45] what I was going to be doing it was
[2:06:47] vastly different and yet it totally fit
[2:06:49] that look the life he had to live in the
[2:06:51] mission he had to do was it was very
[2:06:53] rough and tough and he even getting
[2:06:55] money to buy ships and all the things he
[2:06:56] did and as his idea of commerce because
[2:06:58] then he started realizing if we can give
[2:07:00] these merry people things and show them
[2:07:02] this is quite good it helps us in our
[2:07:03] relationship with him we teach you madam
[2:07:05] we give them things and help them out
[2:07:06] and they'll be better and he had this
[2:07:08] desire to actually enrich their lives
[2:07:09] all across the board not just in the
[2:07:12] gospel so you can imagine his excitement
[2:07:15] when he's actually finally going to get
[2:07:17] to go to New Zealand and visit these
[2:07:19] people with the sole intention really of
[2:07:21] sharing the gospel with him
[2:07:28] now they arrive and about maybe the 19th
[2:07:31] or 20th of December 2014 and the word
[2:07:36] gets around that samuel marsden has
[2:07:38] arrived and all the chiefs come and the
[2:07:40] men row they walk us out and they bring
[2:07:42] them fish and food and all that because
[2:07:44] this means this man's got a lot of
[2:07:46] esteem and respect already amongst the
[2:07:48] people so they they're bringing them
[2:07:50] food and just to paint the picture of it
[2:07:53] wasn't just a low-key visit there was
[2:07:56] the situation that I guess built up over
[2:07:58] ten years almost you know of culminating
[2:08:01] in this event it's not just like I will
[2:08:03] go there and I can you see any people or
[2:08:06] this I'm over there let's go and maybe
[2:08:08] try and tell him of the gospel this was
[2:08:09] a different affair it was actually there
[2:08:12] were things that work over years and
[2:08:13] years and years to cause it to have a
[2:08:15] different atmosphere about it now there
[2:08:18] was there was rapport there was it was
[2:08:20] good goodness all around it like that
[2:08:22] like that like God had sort of walkest
[2:08:24] rated it to be this way and the
[2:08:25] atmosphere amongst them was such and so
[2:08:27] after a few days he went onto the shore
[2:08:30] to talk and you know they all wanted to
[2:08:33] see him but he also heard about the
[2:08:35] fighting between the two tribes one was
[2:08:37] you know only a mile away but because
[2:08:40] you know remember the two tribes were
[2:08:41] fighting because these guys had killed
[2:08:43] the the guys in the ship these guys
[2:08:45] didn't they were killed by the Europeans
[2:08:47] so they were still it was still a war
[2:08:48] happening and he thought well we can't
[2:08:51] we're not going to be able to do
[2:08:52] anything and if these two chiefs these
[2:08:54] two tribes are fighting each other so he
[2:08:56] talked to this one try but then he said
[2:08:57] okay now the ring that was with him was
[2:09:01] I think John somebody he said now we
[2:09:02] want to go and see this other tribe and
[2:09:04] go and meet them and say hello to him so
[2:09:06] he just walked from them walked over to
[2:09:07] the other village and talked with them
[2:09:10] and told them why he was there was there
[2:09:11] to share the gospel and then either said
[2:09:15] look can we stay here tonight
[2:09:16] so him in this other man John they John
[2:09:22] didn't like the idea because in John's
[2:09:23] mind he thought here we are we're
[2:09:25] unprotected it's just him and I we're
[2:09:28] sleeping amongst cannibals murderers and
[2:09:30] cannibals and this guy said we're just
[2:09:32] going to sleep here because seem your
[2:09:33] said to him whatever they tell you just
[2:09:35] to just go to sleep here God's going to
[2:09:36] protect us as nothing's going to happen
[2:09:38] to us so he just went down and went to
[2:09:41] sleep that night sleep among the
[2:09:42] the the guys that they'd all the British
[2:09:44] people he said no it's gonna be
[2:09:45] perfectly fine so you sleep there
[2:09:47] tonight woke up the next day and then he
[2:09:49] said right I want all that do you Maine
[2:09:50] Chiefs to come and have breakfast with
[2:09:51] me on the ship so they all went onto the
[2:09:54] ship and had breakfast and they they um
[2:09:55] oh sorry I've got I want to show you
[2:09:59] that I'm going to first through the so
[2:10:00] here they are turning up and then this
[2:10:04] is just pictures of them you know they
[2:10:06] went to see this other tribe and slip
[2:10:07] there for the night and there was
[2:10:09] reconciliation between the two tribes
[2:10:16] now that may have been a Thursday Friday
[2:10:20] this happened on the Saturday this men
[2:10:22] Russ and I knew that on a Sunday was the
[2:10:24] Sabbath thing you have a service on a
[2:10:26] Sunday so of his own desire of his own
[2:10:31] will he he began to set up a place where
[2:10:33] they could have a church service on the
[2:10:34] Sunday have divine service Sam we didn't
[2:10:36] ask him - apparently he just started
[2:10:37] setting this up himself so he he fenced
[2:10:40] off about half an acre of land and he
[2:10:44] made he made a pulpit he put up - and
[2:10:48] canoes made little seats and because he
[2:10:49] had seen how churches operate overseas
[2:10:51] asleep and he made this big area for the
[2:10:54] church service and he begins telling
[2:10:55] people we're going to have a church
[2:10:56] service here tomorrow we have a what we
[2:10:58] have a church service you all come here
[2:11:00] tomorrow meet we hear the gospel that's
[2:11:04] what he did and I'm gonna show you this
[2:11:08] picture here that's this as there were
[2:11:12] about three and a half thousand people
[2:11:14] gathered at this church service and the
[2:11:17] different tribes were the everyone was
[2:11:19] there and they they all came I don't
[2:11:23] even think they knew why they were there
[2:11:24] but they they just were told that this
[2:11:26] man's gonna tell us something today I
[2:11:28] wanna read you
[2:11:29] Samuel Madison's own words on this to
[2:11:33] get his thoughts on it to write a a
[2:11:38] thorough past the remaining part of the
[2:11:41] previous day on the Saturday and
[2:11:43] preparing for the Sabbath he enclosed
[2:11:44] about half an acre of land with a fence
[2:11:46] he rekted a pulpit and in reading discs
[2:11:48] in the center and covered the whole
[2:11:50] either with black native cloth or some
[2:11:53] duck which he had brought with him from
[2:11:54] Port Jackson he also procured some
[2:11:55] bamboos some bottoms of old canoes and
[2:11:57] fixing up his seats on each side of the
[2:11:59] pulpit for the Europeans to set upon
[2:12:01] including to have divine service there
[2:12:03] the next day these preparations he made
[2:12:05] of his own accord and then the evening
[2:12:07] and for me that everything was ready for
[2:12:09] divine service I was much pleased with
[2:12:11] the singular mark of his attention the
[2:12:13] reading disc was about three feet from
[2:12:14] the ground in the pulpit about six feet
[2:12:16] the black cloth covered the top of the
[2:12:18] pulpit and hung over the sides the
[2:12:19] bottom of the pulpit as well as a
[2:12:20] reading desk was part of a canoe the
[2:12:22] whole was becoming and had a solemn
[2:12:24] appearance he had also erected a
[2:12:26] Flagstaff on the highest hill in the
[2:12:27] village which had a commanding view on
[2:12:31] Sunday morning when I was up on the deck
[2:12:33] I saw the English flag flying so this
[2:12:35] marionette had set up a mast and flew on
[2:12:37] the English flag up which was a pleasing
[2:12:39] sight in New Zealand I considered it as
[2:12:41] a signal of the dawn of civilization and
[2:12:43] liberty and religion and that dark and
[2:12:44] benighted land I never viewed the
[2:12:47] British colors with more gratification
[2:12:48] and flatter myself that they would never
[2:12:50] be removed till all the natives of this
[2:12:53] island enjoyed all the happiness of
[2:12:54] British subjects this was this more
[2:12:56] political mind but then he said at about
[2:12:58] 10 o'clock we prepared to go ashore to
[2:13:00] publish for the first on the glad
[2:13:01] tidings of the gospel I was under no
[2:13:05] apprehension for the safety of the
[2:13:06] vessel and therefore ordered all on
[2:13:08] board to go on shore to attend divine
[2:13:09] service except the master and one man
[2:13:11] when we landed we found Cora Cora
[2:13:14] tortilla and Shengo I don't know her say
[2:13:17] his name dress and regimentals which
[2:13:19] Governor McGuire had given him when
[2:13:20] they're in Australia was the amend rule
[2:13:22] not ready to be Martian to the enclosure
[2:13:24] to attend divine service they had their
[2:13:26] swords by their side their switches in
[2:13:28] their hands
[2:13:29] we entered the enclosure and we're
[2:13:30] placed on the seats on each side of the
[2:13:32] pulpit
[2:13:32] corporal marches men and place them on
[2:13:34] my right hand and the rear of the
[2:13:36] Europeans and Toronto because he was the
[2:13:38] chief places men on the left the
[2:13:40] inhabitans of the town was the woman and
[2:13:42] children in a number of other chiefs
[2:13:43] formed a circle around the hole a very
[2:13:46] solemn silence prevailed the sight was
[2:13:48] truly impressive so you can imagine
[2:13:51] years and years and years and now this
[2:13:53] thing is unfolded to wear now you can
[2:13:56] imagine see me with this about three and
[2:13:57] a half thousand people there and he's
[2:13:59] had this desire to preach the gospel
[2:14:01] through these these people for years and
[2:14:03] years and years and suddenly it's
[2:14:04] happened what a what an awesome time it
[2:14:06] would have been for him to to
[2:14:09] there and then he's about to get up and
[2:14:11] start and and preach the the gospel of
[2:14:14] Jesus Christ then he says I I rose up
[2:14:20] and began singing the service was
[2:14:22] singing the old 100-some and felt my
[2:14:25] very soul melt within me when I viewed
[2:14:28] my congregation and considered the state
[2:14:30] that they were in so seeing the hundreds
[2:14:32] I'm I managed to track down the words
[2:14:34] this is an old song but the words are
[2:14:37] quite fitting this was written by Isaac
[2:14:38] Watts
[2:14:39] he said before jehovah's awesome throne
[2:14:42] ye nations bowel with sacred joy know
[2:14:45] that the Lord is God alone he can create
[2:14:47] and he destroy his sovereign power
[2:14:49] without our aid made us of clay informed
[2:14:52] us then and when like wandering sheep we
[2:14:55] strayed he brought us to his fold again
[2:14:57] will crowd thy gates with thankful songs
[2:15:00] high as the heavens our voices raised
[2:15:02] and earth with her ten thousand tongues
[2:15:05] shall fill thy courts was sounding
[2:15:06] praise why does the world as I command
[2:15:09] vast as eternity that I love firm as a
[2:15:12] rock by truth must stand when rolling
[2:15:14] years cease to move when rolling years
[2:15:18] shall cease to move so his him a hundred
[2:15:20] son and then he preached the first
[2:15:24] Christian service ever to behold in this
[2:15:28] country and the subject he preached on
[2:15:31] was Luke - 10 - 11 and the angel said
[2:15:36] unto them fear not for behold I bring
[2:15:38] you good tidings of great joy which
[2:15:40] shall be to all people for unto you Is
[2:15:43] Born This Day in the City of David a
[2:15:44] savior which is Christ the Lord and that
[2:15:48] was his first message to the people of
[2:15:49] New Zealand I don't think that's an
[2:15:51] amazing story and and that's that's made
[2:15:56] this country what it is part of making
[2:15:58] this country what it is I'm part of the
[2:16:00] the I often think back talking to
[2:16:04] brother Kubek like even I thought it
[2:16:06] this morning when I saw a brother Edie
[2:16:08] and brother kuben embrace you know and
[2:16:11] do that now maybe you're on video you
[2:16:14] can't see them but brother kuben is
[2:16:16] Indian South African and brother Eaters
[2:16:18] there's a white South African but they
[2:16:19] embrace and brother Kuby and said to me
[2:16:21] you know what beckons today for
[2:16:22] he didn't like me I didn't like him we
[2:16:26] didn't talk he said but here we're
[2:16:28] brothers and and and that's the power of
[2:16:32] the gospel of this country
[2:16:33] his has its has created a love in this
[2:16:37] place and it's I'm thankful for men like
[2:16:40] samuel marsden they actually devoted his
[2:16:41] life to wanting to bring the gospel here
[2:16:45] so praise the Lord that some think about
[2:16:50] that because that's that's you're all
[2:16:53] part of a plan to wasn't just semi we're
[2:16:55] all part of a plan God's got a plan he

[2:16:59] got a plan for this place he's still
[2:17:01] with a plan for our neighbors for
[2:17:02] different places he still has a plan and
[2:17:04] we're still part of his plan maybe let's
