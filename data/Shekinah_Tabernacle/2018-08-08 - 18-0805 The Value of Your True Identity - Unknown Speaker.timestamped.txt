[5:46] so on the sunday school the lesson today
[5:51] is about Samson I know this because I'm
[5:55] married to the Sunday school teacher so
[6:00] I'm not sure the whole theme of it but I
[6:04] know that this morning at about 8
[6:07] o'clock
[6:09] Shannon was getting on who gumboots and
[6:11] walking down into the bush down the bank
[6:15] by our house looking for a jawbone of a
[6:21] not quite a mule but a cow you know
[6:25] because Samson had a jawbone and he
[6:28] defeated his enemies with the jawbone
[6:32] but about a year ago one of our cows had
[6:35] an unfortunate incident where fell down
[6:38] the bank and rolled down this big bank
[6:40] and basically he died at the bottom of
[6:44] the bank it was about a year ago and so
[6:45] he thought ah there's a jawbone down
[6:47] here say I think they've got a helmet in
[6:52] the air and that's what the banging is
[6:53] is there's a jawbone being smashed on a
[6:55] helmet she was going to use my son some
[6:58] he goes quick hunting and he hears you
[7:00] know they think I'm a big strong hunting
[7:02] when they catch a pig and they take the
[7:03] jaw and they put it up on the front of
[7:06] the house you know because they caught
[7:09] the pig she wanted to use that to smash
[7:12] the helmet but Dave's his trophy jaws so
[7:15] he wouldn't be here but you know in the
[7:19] story the door never broke as a jawbone
[7:23] of him it was basically a piece of bone
[7:26] but but Samson used that for hours and
[7:30] it never broke so maybe David's jawbone
[7:32] may have been fine but I like that story
[7:37] you know people paint Samson like he's a
[7:39] big strong muscly guy and like he's got
[7:42] the ability to defeat his enemies
[7:44] naturally bit brother branham said he
[7:46] wasn't he was it he was a he didn't look
[7:48] like a strongmen and because it wasn't
[7:51] actually him it was the power of God and
[7:54] him they
[7:55] took over that could achieve the things
[7:56] that he could achieve and that's the
[7:57] same in our life yeah we're nothing
[8:01] great really we're nothing great but
[8:03] it's when it's when the Lord takes over
[8:06] our life is when we achieve anything
[8:07] that's that's where all the power is us
[8:09] we as human beings are very very I don't
[8:12] want to put us down because we are
[8:13] significant in the eyes of God but the
[8:15] ability we have to progress anything is
[8:17] very very small when you think about the
[8:20] output we can do the power that we have
[8:22] to actually do anything we're pretty
[8:24] limited really we're very limited but
[8:26] the power of God as such an abundance
[8:29] and if we have him for us that's why
[8:31] Paul says of God before us who can be
[8:33] against us any minute so let's um let's
[8:36] stand and we'll you know what I'm gonna
[8:40] ask brother Chris if he would open and
[8:42] prayer for us this morning

[49:07] appreciate you all just feel the love
[49:09] amongst us we're just so grateful for
[49:12] what the Lord is doing in this day
[49:14] freakin I'm turn to Philippines I've got
[49:17] three scripture readings that I would
[49:19] like to take before you can have your
[49:20] seat so Philippians chapter 2 verses
[49:22] five
[49:30] the scripture says let this mind be in
[49:33] you which was also in Christ Jesus who
[49:36] being in the form of God thought it not
[49:38] robbery to be equal with God but made
[49:41] himself of no reputation and took upon
[49:43] him the form of a servant and was made
[49:46] in the likeness of men and being found
[49:48] in the fashion as a man he humbled
[49:49] himself and became obedient unto death
[49:52] even the death of the cross
[49:55] became obedient unto death and it's the
[49:57] same we need to become obedient to death
[49:59] to ourselves and we do to die to us all
[50:01] nature herself and lay down our lives Oh
[50:04] what we were born with and given into
[50:06] Christ's hands and then also in Romans
[50:07] 8:28 very familiar portions of scripture
[50:12] this morning Romans 8:28 read a few
[50:17] verses there and we know that all things
[50:22] work together for good to them that love
[50:24] God to them who are called according to
[50:27] his purpose for whom he did foreknow he
[50:30] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[50:33] the image of his son that he might be
[50:36] the firstborn among many brethren
[50:38] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[50:41] he also called and whom he called them
[50:44] he also justified and whom he justified
[50:46] them he also glorified what shall we say
[50:50] to these things if God be for us who can
[50:53] be against us I mean they just won lost
[50:56] those short scripture reading from 2nd
[50:59] Corinthians chapter 5 and verses 17
[51:09] second Corinthians 5:17 as his therefore
[51:12] if any man be in Christ he is a new
[51:16] creature old things are passed away
[51:18] behold all things have become new
[51:22] it's just our heads for rid of three
[51:25] precious heavenly Father o Lord God any
[51:31] man can stand here and read your word
[51:33] can turn back the pages of a Bible and
[51:36] read scripture at all but but all God be
[51:38] fully dependent on your Holy Spirit this
[51:40] man to bring inspiration upon this word
[51:43] all all oh god I just want to come and
[51:45] heal my vessel afresh to you this
[51:47] morning hello God that you administer
[51:49] Lord you know the needs of the hearts of
[51:51] your children Hall oh god I don't know
[51:53] them I don't live with him day by day
[51:55] law but you do you see what happens law
[51:57] behind closed doors you know father the
[52:00] intimate --mess of their relationship
[52:02] with you Lord and I pray father that you
[52:04] administer this morning to each heart to
[52:06] each desire Lord you know touch your
[52:08] hearts of your boat your precious bride
[52:10] this morning
[52:11] hello god I lay myself aside and
[52:13] available for you to use take
[52:16] preeminence this morning well O God if
[52:18] there is any evil spirit that will want
[52:20] to come up against your word this
[52:22] morning I pray you bond and in the name
[52:23] of Jesus Christ Lord just take my
[52:26] complexes and my own abilities and put
[52:28] that aside this morning you just use the
[52:31] gift in my life lord I thank you so much
[52:34] for your presence and your anointing
[52:36] here this morning without that Lord
[52:38] it's a dreaded place to be without that
[52:42] anointing without you coming to anoint
[52:44] this would bless each one this morning
[52:47] in Jesus Christ's name I have you seats
[52:53] this morning we can put up that first
[52:55] slide so I just want to take a little
[52:58] topic this morning on the value of your
[53:01] true identity a value of knowing who you
[53:06] really are and what God thinks of you
[53:09] it's not about how poor Nana how big and
[53:12] how long the tick's may be but it's the
[53:15] value that that has in your life the
[53:17] value that the Scriptures have to you
[53:19] personally
[53:20] that's what it is it's not how long I
[53:23] can minister how long you can pray on
[53:24] how eloquent your speeches and all these
[53:26] things it's not about it it's about its
[53:29] value that you have of that relationship
[53:31] and what it means you so just the
[53:35] meaning of that word value sure you can
[53:37] all see that this morning I'm gonna use
[53:39] a few slides as I go through there's
[53:41] gonna be a bit of reading of scriptures
[53:42] and quotes as we go today so I trust
[53:44] it'll be okay with you all meeting or
[53:48] failures the regard that someone is held
[53:50] to deserve the importance the worth or
[53:53] usefulness of something principles or
[53:55] standards of behavior one's judgment of
[53:58] what is important in life so we put a
[54:00] certain value on something depending on
[54:02] its importance it has to you in life the
[54:06] estimate monetary value so it could have
[54:08] a monetary value of its and you away
[54:10] that's this item abides by its value
[54:13] consider to be important or beneficiary
[54:17] beneficial have a high opinion of so the
[54:21] value that you place on something is
[54:22] because you know it's value and what it
[54:23] means to you you know it's cost to get
[54:27] there but we can all have an object we
[54:32] can all see an object so if I have this
[54:35] bottle of water over here to you might
[54:38] not mean an awful lot but to me standing
[54:41] your ministry I might need a drink of
[54:42] water it has a high importance to me now
[54:45] than what it does to many of you so it's
[54:48] just basically where we put our emphasis
[54:50] on and what our importance is to you in
[54:53] your personal walk with the Lord what is
[54:55] important in your day-to-day life that's
[54:58] what it's about brother Branham talks
[54:59] about that story about a little boy that
[55:01] found its stem it all stamped that he
[55:04] hadn't hear it in his mind he wants an
[55:06] ice cream
[55:07] oh no he's think oh maybe he could sell
[55:09] this little stem and buy an ice cream
[55:11] that's what value he placed on that
[55:13] little stem if he wanted something just
[55:17] temporary that will make him happy and
[55:19] feel good but he went tied me down to
[55:23] the old stem collector the prophet talks
[55:25] about that in a message to her got the
[55:28] story from he says it and he looked over
[55:30] at the stood the stem collector knowing
[55:33] it was a very valuable stem so now we
[55:35] see someone else it has a different
[55:38] perspective of this little piece of
[55:40] paper
[55:40] he knows it's a girl in a greater
[55:42] failure once this little boy might have
[55:43] so he wins and he says he will give him
[55:46] a dollar for their stamp and it was a
[55:48] quick sale to a boy because it's a home
[55:50] now you combine ten or twenty or thirty
[55:52] ice creams with this amount of money
[55:53] it's now I got a lot more than what he
[55:56] thought he would get so here was a quick
[55:57] sale and the profit just goes on it says
[55:59] that he's then that went on to be sold
[56:01] for fifty dollars to somebody else that
[56:03] knew a bit more about and place the
[56:06] higher value and it started to grow and
[56:07] grow and eventually two hundred fifty
[56:09] thousand dollars was placed on this
[56:11] little piece of paper it wasn't really
[56:13] the piece of paper what was oniton it's
[56:14] the its value to that person it had it
[56:16] in their hands so what value we place on
[56:20] the word it might be something small in
[56:24] your life or might be something great it
[56:26] could be that you have a word the Bible
[56:29] app on your phone it might be just a
[56:30] smaller app that you read for what a how
[56:32] does it get its value to you amongst all
[56:35] the other things that you do on that
[56:36] device isn't you've drawn when you turn
[56:38] there the Firestone does it is it
[56:40] something that you want to go to was it
[56:41] was it the last thing weird we want to
[56:43] go to if we use it to read a Bible orbit
[56:45] or a book so the boy placed a small
[56:49] value on that stamp because he wanted
[56:51] something small but the true value was
[56:53] much greater so we sometimes place a
[56:58] value on on the earthly things much
[57:02] higher because we commit a lot more of
[57:04] our time and effort and energy into
[57:06] those things so we focused more on on on
[57:10] the earthly things so just want to take
[57:17] some examples of different items through
[57:19] the scripture that seemingly had no
[57:21] value into one day something quickened
[57:24] and that thing became of such value to
[57:26] that person and straightaway I want to
[57:29] just go through - Rahab Rahab you'll
[57:32] know what kind of a life she lived she
[57:33] was at harlot that was it was there and
[57:37] and she had brought in two strangers to
[57:40] the spires from Israel they came over
[57:42] and went to spy at Elena and she hid
[57:44] them from the main of the city
[57:46] and you you know the whole story but I
[57:48] just want to pick it up now from Joshua
[57:49] chapter 2 Joshua chapter 2 from verses
[57:53] 12 I do have most of scripture readings
[57:55] and stuff up on the slides so it says
[57:59] now therefore I pray you swear unto me
[58:01] by the Lord since I have showed you
[58:03] kindness that he should that he will
[58:06] also show kindness unto my father's
[58:08] house and give me a true token and that
[58:12] he will save alive my father and my
[58:15] mother and my brethren and my sisters
[58:17] and all that they have and deliver our
[58:21] lives from death and the men answered
[58:23] her our lives for yours if you utter not
[58:27] this our business and it shall be when
[58:30] the Lord has given us the land that we
[58:33] will deal kindly and truly with thee
[58:36] then she said then she let him down by a
[58:39] court through the window for a house was
[58:42] upon out on the town wall and she dwelt
[58:44] upon the wall verse 16 and says and she
[58:49] said unto them
[58:50] getta get you onto the mountains lest
[58:52] the pursuers meet you and hide yourself
[58:55] there three days until the pursuers be
[58:57] returned and afterward may he go your
[59:00] way and the men said unto her we will be
[59:03] blameless of this time
[59:05] which thou has made a sweet behold when
[59:08] we come into the land thou shalt bind
[59:11] this line of scarlet thread in the
[59:13] window which thou Judas led us down bar
[59:16] and they'll scarlet and I shall bring
[59:18] thy father in thy mother and thy
[59:20] brethren and all thy father's household
[59:24] home unto thee so now the Scarlet thread
[59:27] that she's now just placing out there is
[59:29] beginning a promise attached to it
[59:32] something has been attached now to the
[59:33] sea it says and it shall be that
[59:35] whosoever shall go out the doors of the
[59:38] of the house into the street his blood
[59:41] shall be upon his head and we will be
[59:43] guiltless and whosoever shall be within
[59:45] the house his blood shall be on our head
[59:49] if any hand be upon him so just wanna
[59:53] maybe Bremer Toit's a story a little bit
[59:55] around she might have
[59:58] you might ask where did this this cord
[1:00:00] at she come from where did this rope end
[1:00:02] up in her place it might have been left
[1:00:03] behind from a previous owner but just
[1:00:06] while we go through this keep in mind
[1:00:08] that this rope is a type of a token the
[1:00:12] word that we have today so up to this
[1:00:16] stage it was just an ordinary cord that
[1:00:17] was displayed laying there in the corner
[1:00:19] of her little house and maybe gathering
[1:00:22] dust she she had no real need for this
[1:00:24] there was no real importance to her she
[1:00:26] might have wanted to throw it away one
[1:00:27] day decide I need to clean up and get
[1:00:29] rid of this this is taking up too much
[1:00:30] space and I have no real need for that
[1:00:33] we just throw it out but the very thing
[1:00:37] that she did not have need of all that
[1:00:39] she thought she very did not have need
[1:00:41] of actually became the salvation for her
[1:00:44] family was the very thing that saved her
[1:00:48] and her family now suddenly this rope
[1:00:49] that that she had had a personal promise
[1:00:51] attached to it something that she could
[1:00:53] now hold on to something that she knew
[1:00:55] that was something special for her that
[1:00:58] rope means something new it had a
[1:01:00] different meaning it changed its value
[1:01:02] to her all of a sudden so it was no it's
[1:01:07] not just a book of promises now they lay
[1:01:09] on a shelf it becomes alive to you
[1:01:10] become something that is real to you
[1:01:12] then you open it it's now something
[1:01:14] because there is a promise attached to
[1:01:16] it for you person because it becomes a
[1:01:18] personal relationship now with that
[1:01:20] author of the book now it becomes a
[1:01:22] value so she had how household it was
[1:01:24] now under this token that was applied
[1:01:26] for this rope she would have now treated
[1:01:28] the scene totally different she knew
[1:01:33] these relax are coming to destroy them
[1:01:34] she knew that the head no hope we have
[1:01:37] no hope we had not hope outside of
[1:01:39] Christ she didn't she needed a way of
[1:01:42] escape she did something that she could
[1:01:44] step out of and get away from from this
[1:01:47] on sort that was coming against it and
[1:01:50] that's what in Joshua 2 & 9 it says and
[1:01:52] she said unto the men I know that the
[1:01:55] Lord has given you the land she knew
[1:01:57] that they were in trouble she knew that
[1:02:00] this great god of the Israelites they
[1:02:02] could never defeat him and she needed a
[1:02:05] way of escape she could identify that
[1:02:07] she needed something that her people did
[1:02:08] not have
[1:02:09] she knew they had something real and
[1:02:11] what she had and what the city had was
[1:02:13] not real they could not save her in
[1:02:15] their time of trouble that she could now
[1:02:17] step forward she needed to take a grasp
[1:02:19] of something something real something
[1:02:20] that they could promise to her that's
[1:02:23] what it was
[1:02:23] so then the Lord had given you the land
[1:02:27] and the terror is fallen upon us those
[1:02:29] people were fearful in a day and age it
[1:02:31] is so fearful out there that our world
[1:02:33] is falling apart we have something that
[1:02:35] has been given us that we can hold on to
[1:02:37] and that's exactly what this woman
[1:02:39] wanted she needed something that she
[1:02:41] could stand firm on and say I am
[1:02:43] confident now that I'll be saying this
[1:02:46] is what she needed for we have said and
[1:02:50] all the inhabitants of the land faint
[1:02:53] because of you
[1:02:54] the people around us are fainting it
[1:02:57] because of us because of what is coming
[1:02:59] upon the earth for we have heard how the
[1:03:02] Lord dried up the water they heard about
[1:03:05] these mighty things at the heaven and he
[1:03:07] said that how you destroy those other
[1:03:10] kings so she knew that they were just
[1:03:11] totally wiped out and she needed
[1:03:14] something when we need to get that
[1:03:16] revelation to that we are lost with
[1:03:19] outside of what outside of the Savior
[1:03:22] that we have neither because we were
[1:03:25] born in sin shaped in iniquity until we
[1:03:27] can actually grasp that we we are in
[1:03:28] that state until we can actually get
[1:03:31] that revelation that we need somebody to
[1:03:33] help us we cannot make it on our own
[1:03:35] anymore we cannot survive without
[1:03:37] something more than what we have right
[1:03:40] and if we need the cross that we need
[1:03:42] that what Christ had done if we stay in
[1:03:45] this simple condition we won't have a
[1:03:47] way of escape and we know that and you
[1:03:50] can see it but it needs to become a
[1:03:51] personal relationship so that we can
[1:03:53] place a higher value on what the cross
[1:03:55] means because sometimes it is just taken
[1:03:57] for granted and it's just a nice story
[1:03:59] but if it actually takes on a meaning to
[1:04:02] show you that you were totally lost and
[1:04:05] without that you're unable to get
[1:04:06] through to the other side without that
[1:04:08] they all meet the judgment and the wrath
[1:04:10] that is coming upon the earth so the
[1:04:14] Scarlet thread was her this escape from
[1:04:17] death now what was her value of this
[1:04:19] rope she have would have guarded it now
[1:04:22] with her
[1:04:23] why that hope had a different meaning to
[1:04:26] her from that day forth she would have
[1:04:30] found a special place to put this
[1:04:33] she would have guarded it with her life
[1:04:35] maybe beforehand she would have borrowed
[1:04:37] it out to somebody lent it out and
[1:04:38] didn't care if it came back or not but
[1:04:40] now somebody comes to me borrow their
[1:04:42] rope no it's mine
[1:04:43] not maybe I go out of my sight this is
[1:04:46] mine
[1:04:46] hi this is my word you can't have it
[1:04:48] anymore this is for me
[1:04:50] fine get your oil that you need I've got
[1:04:53] this holy goes how it is mine and she
[1:04:58] wins she would have gone to hell maybe
[1:05:00] wrap this rope around her and went into
[1:05:01] the town and she might have looked like
[1:05:03] an odd character to the people there why
[1:05:05] are you carrying this rope around with
[1:05:06] you the whole time you look strange it's
[1:05:09] the same walk around it's good along
[1:05:11] here you look strange what's a different
[1:05:13] way why you look why you burden yourself
[1:05:15] with us no but it was her way of escape
[1:05:18] she knew her identity she she could hold
[1:05:21] onto something and she wasn't gonna let
[1:05:24] it go because that's what they had
[1:05:26] promised for her she wanna look strange
[1:05:29] to this world
[1:05:30] we're oddballs to this world aro laughed
[1:05:33] at her and mocked her and no matter what
[1:05:36] they had said to her she wasn't gonna
[1:05:38] get rid of this token she knew she knew
[1:05:40] that she needed it and these people in
[1:05:42] the city didn't really understand what
[1:05:44] this was all about that she had away the
[1:05:46] sky one will see goes back to that
[1:05:50] little wash woman that the Prophet talks
[1:05:52] about yeah when that um the righteous
[1:05:57] son was looking for a wife and he went
[1:05:58] out there and those cousins that were
[1:06:00] treating you they weren't really badly
[1:06:03] Anette and he made a promise to her and
[1:06:05] what did she do she no matter what if
[1:06:08] accusations came against her she put
[1:06:11] their wedding gown with her she put it
[1:06:13] on she she walked around with this thing
[1:06:14] with a broad in her heart she knew it
[1:06:17] was her way of escape that he was coming
[1:06:19] to fetch her and no matter what the
[1:06:21] mockers and scoffers and or that came
[1:06:23] against her she hates her confidence in
[1:06:25] the promise it was given to her she put
[1:06:29] on that wedding garment and she went out
[1:06:31] to meet him so then the day came when
[1:06:34] the Israelites armies approached the
[1:06:35] city
[1:06:36] and she had a piece in her heart because
[1:06:39] she had kept two kept true to that word
[1:06:42] in the message the token says notice
[1:06:47] there was given to her a red token that
[1:06:50] scarlet string that she had let down let
[1:06:53] the people the spires down out of the
[1:06:55] window was to be a token God would not
[1:06:59] destroy the destroying angel God's
[1:07:01] destroying angel would not come near her
[1:07:03] as long as she had their token but and
[1:07:06] what if she would say oh I'll let it
[1:07:10] down I done I've done a good deed now so
[1:07:13] now to keep anyone from criticizing me
[1:07:16] see and seeing that scarlet rope hanging
[1:07:19] out there I'll pull the rope back up so
[1:07:22] now he's saying oh maybe she'll feel
[1:07:24] embarrassed that she's not gonna leave
[1:07:25] that rope there and she's gonna pull it
[1:07:27] up and hide it somewhere but no one sees
[1:07:29] it but he says he says I'll pull that
[1:07:32] rope back up says then the judgement
[1:07:35] angel wouldn't have never passed over
[1:07:37] her house if they token was not on
[1:07:40] display at judgment angel would have
[1:07:41] come in she had to have their token
[1:07:45] displayed it had to remain thee I
[1:07:48] believe that the scarlet thread had to
[1:07:51] be displayed or the angel destroying
[1:07:53] angel would have never honored anything
[1:07:56] else but their token when it was
[1:07:58] displayed amen
[1:07:59] messengers gave her a token and she must
[1:08:02] keep it display do we sometimes hide out
[1:08:08] okay do we sometimes hide that we are a
[1:08:10] Christian when we get into difficult
[1:08:12] situations maybe at school at work where
[1:08:14] we are let me hide their token waiter
[1:08:18] we'll just keep quiet or we'll just
[1:08:20] pertain to be like them or try and just
[1:08:24] fit in with the world not to stand out
[1:08:27] and maybe received some criticism and
[1:08:30] all those different things I'll be
[1:08:33] placing a higher value what the Lord has
[1:08:35] done for us no matter what comes our way
[1:08:37] are we going to stand and say this is
[1:08:40] what I believe I do not take that I do
[1:08:42] not do this
[1:08:43] because it's not pleasing unto my lord
[1:08:44] it's not the book of rules that the Lord
[1:08:46] has given us and that's what we need to
[1:08:48] understand he doesn't come and lay down
[1:08:50] rules and say this and this it's out of
[1:08:52] a reliable relationship that your coming
[1:08:54] to Christ and then we say because we
[1:08:56] love you Lord we don't want to do that
[1:08:58] yes people make mistakes we will fire a
[1:09:00] will or we'll stumble but Lord forgive
[1:09:03] me I don't want to do those things
[1:09:04] that's a different kind of a
[1:09:06] relationship it's not otherwise as a god
[1:09:09] that's every time you fall you expecting
[1:09:11] a smack and I'm gonna beating in a and a
[1:09:14] ridicule or a breaking down or a hard
[1:09:17] cutting sermon or whatever it might be
[1:09:19] and that's what we expect our God is
[1:09:21] like living under our law but he is here
[1:09:24] and it's he doesn't want the kind of a
[1:09:26] relationship with you he wants to be
[1:09:27] able to have the love relationship with
[1:09:29] you that you're his wife and how would
[1:09:31] you how would you treat your wife wants
[1:09:35] to treat you really had their kind of
[1:09:38] relationship so what if she didn't take
[1:09:44] care of this rope you know well it
[1:09:46] doesn't really matter if it's not the
[1:09:48] same her bow found another rope at the
[1:09:49] time and throw it out she might have got
[1:09:53] the the soldiers to believe it's the
[1:09:54] same road because they wouldn't have
[1:09:56] known it but the mighty God knew exactly
[1:09:59] which one what was the token so no
[1:10:01] matter how much pretense you might put
[1:10:03] on the outside what we might dress like
[1:10:05] away your act like it and that that God
[1:10:08] knows what the intent of the heart is we
[1:10:10] can look like brothers and sisters to
[1:10:12] each other
[1:10:12] but what about our heart how is there
[1:10:14] this be expressed what is inside there
[1:10:17] that we are hiding from everyone we can
[1:10:19] bring it out to the Lord and say Lord I
[1:10:21] identified I see myself in the word and
[1:10:23] I'll see our lack here and there
[1:10:25] don't beat yourself up because you don't
[1:10:27] match that you just go to the Lord and
[1:10:29] say Lord I see this but I can't change
[1:10:30] myself I can't fix the Lord and that's
[1:10:35] all he is wanting he wants you to
[1:10:37] surrender head in through his head and
[1:10:39] it's such a difficult thing to be able
[1:10:41] to die the dying process is hard if you
[1:10:45] just take any human that is sick and
[1:10:47] dying at all the hard time that they go
[1:10:49] through and to surrender your will and
[1:10:52] to surrender
[1:10:52] you have to the Lord that is a difficult
[1:10:55] process and the Lord is here to be with
[1:10:57] us through that different time but at
[1:10:58] heartens so another another item I want
[1:11:03] to cover off his Moses let's go to
[1:11:05] Exodus chapter 4 Exodus for from verses
[1:11:10] 1 to 5 that rod that Moses head was just
[1:11:13] an ordinary stick whoever he got it from
[1:11:15] we don't know exactly no it was just
[1:11:19] something that he had and Moses and this
[1:11:24] is from Jenna Exodus 4 verses 1 and
[1:11:27] Moses answered and said but behold they
[1:11:29] will not believe me nor hearken unto my
[1:11:32] voice for they will say the LORD hath
[1:11:34] not appeared unto thee and the Lord said
[1:11:37] unto him what is that what is in thine
[1:11:39] hand and he said a rod just an ordinary
[1:11:43] stick Lord his sister rod just a vessel
[1:11:46] just-just-just whereas I am just an
[1:11:48] ordinary thing and he said cast it on
[1:11:51] the ground and he cast it on the ground
[1:11:53] and it became a serpent and Moses fled
[1:11:55] from before it now all of a sudden his
[1:11:56] his stick 34 was just a common stick is
[1:11:59] got something some other meaning to it
[1:12:01] all of a sudden it becomes a snake a
[1:12:03] serpent and he said Coster on the ground
[1:12:09] and Moses feet look at Moses it reversed
[1:12:10] voices and the Lord said unto Moses put
[1:12:12] forth thine hand and take it by the tail
[1:12:14] and he put forth his hand and caught it
[1:12:16] and it became a rod in his hand that
[1:12:19] they may believe that the Lord God of
[1:12:21] their fathers and God of Abraham and God
[1:12:25] of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath
[1:12:27] appeared unto thee up until this time
[1:12:29] Moses might not have given much thought
[1:12:32] about that rod it was a help to him
[1:12:36] maybe on his day to day life but he
[1:12:39] could not be but he could go without it
[1:12:40] there was days he maybe just left at the
[1:12:42] dying at home and picked up something
[1:12:43] else that he needed when he was out with
[1:12:45] the Sheep he might not have have cared
[1:12:50] too much I'd have just thrown a stick
[1:12:54] down in the corner lifted there when you
[1:12:56] got home he's tired we could just chuck
[1:12:58] it down are no care about it
[1:13:02] some mornings we couldn't found the
[1:13:04] stick and you would leave without it it
[1:13:06] would just go out on this day with
[1:13:08] without Ed intending to his daily
[1:13:10] business without founding his stick
[1:13:15] sometimes we treat the Word of God like
[1:13:18] that it's just another stick that's
[1:13:23] let's say or another book on the shelf
[1:13:24] so you could have gone many years like
[1:13:29] they just leave his home when sometimes
[1:13:32] you would take it sometimes he won't
[1:13:33] you're off the year off the euro you
[1:13:35] could have gone like that while he was
[1:13:36] out there on the backside of the desert
[1:13:38] a one special morning there was a there
[1:13:41] was something stirring in his heart
[1:13:43] there was something that Moses knew he
[1:13:45] had to go that day with that stick he
[1:13:48] didn't know why he didn't understand it
[1:13:50] but he knew he had to pick up that stick
[1:13:52] and take it with and found it and all
[1:13:53] now you didn't know where you put it the
[1:13:55] next day you threw it down somewhere so
[1:13:56] you got his servants in use what if we
[1:13:59] helped found the Sonny the stick I need
[1:14:01] this rod today for something reason
[1:14:02] something is compelling me I need to
[1:14:04] take this with me today
[1:14:05] and take it I need to go out and they
[1:14:08] would have hunted and looked in and
[1:14:09] found and he she ever came up with it
[1:14:11] and it's the same thing there might be a
[1:14:13] day in the morning in your life where
[1:14:15] you despite pass the word each day you
[1:14:17] skip over it okay it's not doesn't show
[1:14:20] much meaning to you today but there
[1:14:22] comes a day when the Lord inspires you
[1:14:24] to pick it up to tell it to a certain
[1:14:26] scripture and you read it and it is
[1:14:28] something that is quicken out to you
[1:14:29] becomes a person or a thing to you it
[1:14:32] becomes a revelation that the Lord wants
[1:14:33] to give you that day it sustains you and
[1:14:35] changes your life and it becomes then
[1:14:37] you've become a greater value to you you
[1:14:40] certain scriptures as you go through
[1:14:42] life that that the Lord gives you it to
[1:14:44] a difficult time
[1:14:45] and then all of a sudden it becomes an
[1:14:46] anchor something you go back to
[1:14:48] something that you can hold on to and
[1:14:51] that's what it's about so yes they would
[1:14:55] have been a lot of maybe heated
[1:14:56] conversations in their tent that day
[1:14:58] with them with Moses trying to found the
[1:15:00] stick but he's got it eventually and he
[1:15:03] went out and then while he was on the
[1:15:06] backside of the desert he's seen that
[1:15:07] strange sight that was just before the
[1:15:09] scripture was an exodus 3 he saw this
[1:15:11] the strange side of this burning bush
[1:15:13] and he turned aside
[1:15:16] that is an exodus three versus one
[1:15:21] Somoza skipped the flock as a city was
[1:15:24] in he came to that mountain of God even
[1:15:25] even to Horeb and the angel the Lord
[1:15:28] appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out
[1:15:30] of the midst of the bush and he looked
[1:15:31] and behold the bush burned with fire and
[1:15:34] the bush was not consumed and Moses said
[1:15:38] I will now turn aside and see this great
[1:15:41] sight why the bush is not burnt and when
[1:15:45] you and when the Lord saw that he had
[1:15:47] turned aside to see God called unto Him
[1:15:49] out of the midst of the bush and said to
[1:15:51] Moses Moses and he said Here I am I was
[1:15:54] a stopped and turned aside to receive
[1:15:56] his commission
[1:15:57] he received his burning bush experience
[1:15:59] he received that attack that that
[1:16:02] experience with the Lord then as he was
[1:16:05] talking with God God said I'll give you
[1:16:08] a sign as you made earlier not gonna
[1:16:11] read that whole thing again but we've
[1:16:12] read that Scripture you'll give him a
[1:16:13] sign and the stick now became his sign
[1:16:15] became his token became what he held on
[1:16:17] to for the whole journey it was
[1:16:19] something that they used now most this
[1:16:21] caught the revelation of why you had to
[1:16:22] pick up that stick that day why he had
[1:16:24] her taken with him that that wasn't just
[1:16:26] an ordinary stick there the stick was
[1:16:27] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:16:29] the world to be there and to be used at
[1:16:31] their time and they might have been a
[1:16:33] Bible lying in your home when you bought
[1:16:35] it or a message book that you picked up
[1:16:36] somewhere it was a time where you've
[1:16:38] walked that path and something caught
[1:16:40] your attention you need to pick this up
[1:16:41] you need to take us with you today there
[1:16:43] is something in this set the Lord wants
[1:16:45] to reveal to me you might not have even
[1:16:47] thought that that it means anything but
[1:16:49] you took it that day but sometimes
[1:16:51] through their day there was something
[1:16:53] that quickens out of that word as you
[1:16:55] started to read it and became alive it
[1:16:57] became personal to you so now the
[1:17:04] sticker became a sign to Israel for many
[1:17:07] years to come and the message why it had
[1:17:10] to be shepherds it says now going he was
[1:17:12] going to change nature to make it work
[1:17:15] for them watch the pole watch the
[1:17:17] serpent watch the Red Sea and whatever
[1:17:21] that he did now look at that shepherds
[1:17:24] go making a way for them to go that
[1:17:27] stick that was in the Shepherd's
[1:17:29] I post every bit of Technology and all
[1:17:33] the things and the priest said the
[1:17:37] priest had said and that's shepherds rod
[1:17:41] led them right on down through every
[1:17:43] impossible thing well Pharaoh tried to
[1:17:46] think that the cataracts erupted up in
[1:17:48] the mountains and throw it at water then
[1:17:50] made it to turn into blood then God
[1:17:54] rained fire out of heaven he rained hail
[1:17:56] out of heaven and everything was done
[1:17:58] through this token to sing it but if
[1:18:01] Moses had received how Moses would have
[1:18:08] gone home their day was their different
[1:18:12] value on that stick he would have gone
[1:18:14] home and now found a special place to
[1:18:17] put this this this this rod that he had
[1:18:19] received with it with a promise attached
[1:18:21] to it became a special item for him it
[1:18:26] was the same stickers a day before to
[1:18:28] everyone else she's still the same stick
[1:18:30] it's still the same Bible as it was
[1:18:32] yesterday a hundred years a thousand
[1:18:33] years it's still the same book but now
[1:18:36] all of a sudden I was just had a
[1:18:38] different approach to it a different
[1:18:40] respect a different way he saw that that
[1:18:43] stick going forward because it became a
[1:18:47] personal experiences to me had an
[1:18:48] experience with the author of that of
[1:18:50] this book we have that experience then
[1:18:52] it becomes of a great value
[1:18:56] you can't go Dave a day without spending
[1:18:58] time in it
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:09] so what value amount of value you place
[1:19:12] on an item is based on how I said item
[1:19:15] means to you
[1:19:18] at times we lose the value of this
[1:19:22] message at times we lose what a bet you
[1:19:25] really mean to us the first time became
[1:19:26] our path what God has done here each and
[1:19:31] every day
[1:19:32] Oh in our day what is he actually done
[1:19:34] it loses some values becomes common or
[1:19:37] something else gets more attention just
[1:19:40] the cares of life come in that robs us
[1:19:42] trials and things steal a joy away still
[1:19:46] the zeal away still the desires away the
[1:19:49] problems at work and their burdens and
[1:19:51] stress and all these things they'd weigh
[1:19:53] down heavy on us take our attention away
[1:19:55] instead of drawing us closer to the Lord
[1:19:58] he wants to kiss so you place a value on
[1:20:01] their Amen so just want to now just turn
[1:20:06] the service a little bit up we've looked
[1:20:07] at the value of an item and what it
[1:20:10] means in it but now I wanna go and look
[1:20:11] at the identification your identity
[1:20:14] because I'm gonna wrap up and tell you
[1:20:16] what God thinks of you what he says your
[1:20:20] identity so let's just look at this
[1:20:22] section now just knowing your true
[1:20:26] identity is really what I want to get
[1:20:28] across this morning to each and every
[1:20:29] one of you
[1:20:30] there's no what God thinks about you we
[1:20:33] need to founder our identification in
[1:20:35] the word we must find ourselves in there
[1:20:37] in the word and what God has said about
[1:20:39] us to determine our true value to
[1:20:43] determine what God thinks of us it's why
[1:20:47] the scripture says in Philippians 2 in
[1:20:50] verses 5 to 6 is a third man being you
[1:20:53] which we read in the opening scripture
[1:20:54] which was also in Christ Jesus who been
[1:20:57] in the form of God thought it not
[1:20:58] robbery to be equal with God and we take
[1:21:01] on that mind of Christ then we start to
[1:21:04] see ourselves away God knows we start to
[1:21:06] see ourselves through his eyes and not
[1:21:08] the way that we can see herself in the
[1:21:11] mirror and we can identify ourselves as
[1:21:14] the Bride of Christ because now we're
[1:21:16] taking on the mind of Christ and now the
[1:21:18] way Christ sees us you see
[1:21:20] says he's bright it's virtuous Cygnus
[1:21:23] now we can start to say look I want dead
[1:21:25] wine I'm gonna see myself through that
[1:21:27] picture to those eyes that's what I want
[1:21:30] to see and the misidentification it says
[1:21:35] now just now Jesus gave us an example of
[1:21:37] what we ought to be looking at when he
[1:21:40] reflected his life to us through the
[1:21:43] word what we should see when we look
[1:21:46] into God's mirror we should see
[1:21:48] ourselves identified with him identified
[1:21:52] with him in assist that's the perfect
[1:21:53] example a perfect example is when we can
[1:21:56] see ourselves identified with him
[1:21:58] through his identification not on
[1:22:00] ourselves and our weaknesses and all
[1:22:01] those things when we look not the way we
[1:22:03] see ourselves when we look in the mirror
[1:22:05] but do we see and identify ourselves
[1:22:07] with Christ that's our true
[1:22:11] identification it is in God we
[1:22:13] identifies out of it another part of
[1:22:19] that message an identification
[1:22:20] says you you cannot no way ever produce
[1:22:23] a character like that only accepting
[1:22:26] their character in you a church cannot
[1:22:29] do that a creed cannot do that a
[1:22:31] denomination cannot do that an education
[1:22:34] cannot do that it must be a bird it's
[1:22:37] got to be a dying out and let God in by
[1:22:41] the grace of creb mold this type of
[1:22:44] character in here let you become him and
[1:22:48] your life and his is the same then you
[1:22:53] are the sons and daughters of God our
[1:22:56] wife and him when we have through that
[1:22:58] new birth we now fulfill a scripture we
[1:23:02] are we for furthered that his life is
[1:23:03] within us it's a dying out to ourselves
[1:23:07] and we cannot ever make it happen we can
[1:23:10] never produce that character as a
[1:23:12] prophet or the Lord is not one thing has
[1:23:14] to produce it and if we are still trying
[1:23:16] to produce it let me tell you to lay
[1:23:18] that there the Lord is not happy with us
[1:23:20] trying he wants none of our input he
[1:23:23] wants to receive all the glories I want
[1:23:31] to look at an example of someone that
[1:23:33] did not place much better
[1:23:34] on his life but God had told him he was
[1:23:37] comes and tells him who he was and that
[1:23:39] is didya getting in the bible did not
[1:23:41] see himself as much he was looking
[1:23:43] through his natural eyes and seeing all
[1:23:45] the obstacles seeing the enemy is seeing
[1:23:47] all these things they would come in and
[1:23:48] steal the wheat every here feeling that
[1:23:50] here is worthless he was nothing seeing
[1:23:53] how great the enemy was but what did the
[1:23:56] Lord declare is our density to be let's
[1:23:59] have a look at theirs in judges judges
[1:24:01] six verses 11 and 12 this is now the law
[1:24:05] the angel of the Lord prophesies capital
[1:24:07] ll or D which was God Himself came to
[1:24:10] came to Gideon this day wasn't just some
[1:24:13] angel it was the angel of the Lord this
[1:24:15] is then the angel of the Lord this is
[1:24:19] then there came an angel of the Lord and
[1:24:21] said under the oak which was in offer
[1:24:23] and pertained to Joyce
[1:24:25] the abra zire and his son giddy a
[1:24:28] threshing wheat in the what by the
[1:24:30] winepress to hide it from the Midianites
[1:24:32] now he was he was scared he was fearful
[1:24:35] he was now hiding his grains so that he
[1:24:39] could have some food for the next year
[1:24:41] because they always came in every time
[1:24:44] the media had to steal and to steal this
[1:24:45] seems away but look what the Lord says
[1:24:47] he said in and the angel of the Lord
[1:24:49] appeared unto him and said unto Him the
[1:24:51] Lord is with thee
[1:24:52] now mighty man of Valor the angel Oh
[1:24:56] Lord came to Gideon to declare his true
[1:24:58] identity to declare to him and say you
[1:25:01] are not this little one that needs to be
[1:25:03] running away from people but you are a
[1:25:05] mighty man of Valor you can stand
[1:25:07] toe-to-toe with Satan yea you can
[1:25:09] destroy him because of who I because of
[1:25:12] your true identity because I am backing
[1:25:14] you because their power of God is within
[1:25:16] you coming from me and I can slice a he
[1:25:20] has no grounds he's got no way to come
[1:25:22] against God's identification of who you
[1:25:26] are that counts not what the devil
[1:25:28] whispers in your ear he goes boo and you
[1:25:31] step back no we can boo back to him
[1:25:33] it's my we are my team innovate
[1:25:38] so the danger of the Lord coding that my
[1:25:41] team may know better
[1:25:42] this was not how Gideon saw himself but
[1:25:45] God saw him this way so many times look
[1:25:48] at ourselves and we break ourselves down
[1:25:50] because we see our mistakes our
[1:25:51] weaknesses our struggles our trials the
[1:25:54] different things they come our way and
[1:25:55] we think we are nothing but God's
[1:25:58] opinion or gods and she god doesn't have
[1:26:01] a pinion of you he has a fact it's just
[1:26:03] what it is
[1:26:04] there is no opinion the devil comes with
[1:26:06] his opinions and tries to make an
[1:26:08] opinion and say oh you if you if you are
[1:26:10] this if you are that he's trying to cost
[1:26:12] his kind of a DAT opinion God has said
[1:26:15] you are that settles it
[1:26:17] his word is final and the message has
[1:26:22] not I sent thee the proper season when
[1:26:24] he spake to Gideon Gideon was a little
[1:26:26] surprised he said now mighty man of
[1:26:29] Valor he didn't know he was maybe you
[1:26:32] don't know you are you might be many of
[1:26:35] those mighty men of vellus tonight
[1:26:37] sitting here there might be the young
[1:26:39] ones sitting here to that um this mighty
[1:26:42] men of era and you don't realize that
[1:26:44] Edward maybe hasn't come past your way
[1:26:46] to quicken or to show you to you and I'm
[1:26:48] just here this morning just to say you
[1:26:50] are you are that mighty you know that
[1:26:52] this is who what the scripture says
[1:26:54] about who you are there was only two to
[1:27:01] thee him and his daddy there it only has
[1:27:03] to be to hear you and Christ that's all
[1:27:07] it takes to be a mighty man of Valor
[1:27:09] that's right
[1:27:10] all it takes is Christ to you it all it
[1:27:13] takes us just him when you operates
[1:27:15] through you you don't have to do
[1:27:16] anything he just operates it through
[1:27:18] your life and you become a mighty man of
[1:27:20] Valor because of Christ you might be
[1:27:25] sitting here not thinking much of
[1:27:26] yourself but the Lord has declared that
[1:27:29] your is sinless virtuous bride there is
[1:27:32] nothing held to your account okay we
[1:27:35] come from God we were taken out of him
[1:27:37] we are bone of his bone
[1:27:39] we need was taken from Adam she did not
[1:27:41] know who she was I read him you Adam you
[1:27:45] believe came from Eve did not come up to
[1:27:47] Adam and say Adam I am bone of your
[1:27:49] and fish your fish I did not know that
[1:27:52] Adam knew that Adam was the one that
[1:27:55] says your bone of my bone a fish my fish
[1:27:57] that's in Genesis 2:21 and 23 and the
[1:28:01] Lord caused a deep sleep and it says
[1:28:02] took that rib and verse 22 which the
[1:28:05] Lord God has taken from a man and made a
[1:28:08] woman and brought her unto the man so
[1:28:10] now he takes it and he brings that woman
[1:28:12] on to the man and Adam said this is now
[1:28:15] bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh
[1:28:16] she shall be called woman because she
[1:28:19] was taken out of man it was not even my
[1:28:22] TAV walked through the garden maybe an
[1:28:24] endless animal would have said I she
[1:28:26] look something similar to Adam or
[1:28:27] something similar to a serpent maybe
[1:28:30] she's this maybe she's that they would
[1:28:32] have questioned that and doubt it or
[1:28:33] maybe try to tell Eve this is who you
[1:28:36] are but when she came to the one that
[1:28:39] she came out of he could correctly
[1:28:41] identify and quiet and all those voices
[1:28:44] that would have come away through the
[1:28:45] day through the way through the years to
[1:28:47] say you not the bride you're not this
[1:28:49] you're not that here comes your Adam
[1:28:51] this morning to tell you you are the
[1:28:53] bride this is my opinion of you here
[1:28:55] come from me so how can identify who you
[1:28:58] are in giving you your true identity and
[1:29:00] not what the devil wants you to be and
[1:29:02] what this one says you are or what your
[1:29:03] mom or your dad says you are or how you
[1:29:05] feel about yourself but it's now Christ
[1:29:08] he's the one that steps forth and says
[1:29:10] this is who you are he identifies
[1:29:12] setting you cease your burn on my bone
[1:29:14] and flesh of my flesh
[1:29:15] you have come out of me that day on
[1:29:17] Calvary you came out of me
[1:29:19] so now you're coming back to me and this
[1:29:21] is who you are that's just exactly what
[1:29:23] Christ is doing is what Adam did there
[1:29:25] was our example he identified Eve so God
[1:29:32] is the one that declares to us who we
[1:29:34] are be a bone of his bone of viciousness
[1:29:37] not what we think of ourselves or what
[1:29:40] the devil tries we are a part of him the
[1:29:43] same way even Eve was taken out of edit
[1:29:46] I mean it is the rising of the Sun the
[1:29:52] Prophet says and as he as being the
[1:29:55] groom the bride has to come forth
[1:29:57] because it's part of him
[1:30:00] and it can only be the manifestation of
[1:30:03] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:30:05] any other has spoken of the Bible it can
[1:30:10] only manifest if it does something it
[1:30:13] says it can only manifest . if it does
[1:30:15] something different from the groom it's
[1:30:18] not it isn't the bride so then it's a
[1:30:22] different anointing maybe that's on them
[1:30:23] I might still be speak make mistakes and
[1:30:26] do something somebody comes that they've
[1:30:27] allowed the spirit of something else to
[1:30:29] to come through a brother or a sister
[1:30:31] and we can identify that that's not that
[1:30:33] the Spirit of Christ we don't blame the
[1:30:35] man or the woman we look at then
[1:30:37] identify that spirit that is trying to
[1:30:38] operate through them they did his the
[1:30:41] bride tip it it isn't the brightest is
[1:30:43] because she is flesh of his fish bone of
[1:30:45] his bone life of his life power of his
[1:30:48] power
[1:30:48] she is him she is him as a man and a
[1:30:56] woman are one and the woman taken from
[1:30:58] his side she had taken a spirit the
[1:31:02] feminist spirit from him the flesh from
[1:31:05] his side made both mechanics and
[1:31:08] dynamics the way the spirit of him and
[1:31:11] the flesh of him and put it together and
[1:31:14] made mechanics and dynamics until the
[1:31:16] church becomes both dynamics and
[1:31:18] mechanics and the Spirit of God that
[1:31:19] moved him to do the things that he did
[1:31:22] if it hit on 16 cylinders so will the
[1:31:26] bride Amy so will we we will be the same
[1:31:30] and of the station is because it's not
[1:31:33] him living through us so what did what
[1:31:35] what can you expect to be different it's
[1:31:38] just our complexes our insecurities that
[1:31:40] stop the moving of the Lord in our lives
[1:31:42] because we want to speak up too much
[1:31:45] maybe pride too much things that o will
[1:31:46] feel ashamed if we do this Oh will will
[1:31:48] have us in your pride is it no I don't
[1:31:50] want to do it I don't I look it like
[1:31:52] this that I want to look up look to be
[1:31:53] silly or anything like that but just
[1:31:56] Christ when he comes and takes and
[1:31:57] surrenders you surrender there to him he
[1:31:59] then operates on those 16 cylinders of
[1:32:02] the page there's a mighty machine moving
[1:32:04] through and there is nothing that can
[1:32:06] stand against God as those two and the
[1:32:10] scriptures that knew who they were
[1:32:11] and the classic example is David David
[1:32:15] is one that we we love so much because
[1:32:18] he was a man after God's own heart and
[1:32:21] when he came to fight Goliath What did
[1:32:22] he say in 1st Samuel 17 says then David
[1:32:26] didn't say David to the Philistines thou
[1:32:29] comest to me with the sword and with the
[1:32:31] spear and with the shield but I come to
[1:32:33] thee in the name of the Lord of hosts
[1:32:35] and the god of the armies of Israel whom
[1:32:38] now defiers he was confident he knew who
[1:32:42] he was he knew who the children of
[1:32:44] Israel were he didn't doubt those things
[1:32:47] that he wasn't scared to confess it it's
[1:32:50] one thing to believe it it's one thing
[1:32:52] to say it in yourself but you confess it
[1:32:54] out that's the difference that's when
[1:32:56] Alexis shows that you have a revelation
[1:32:57] of what you're saying because you can't
[1:33:00] confess in the face of the enemy if you
[1:33:02] actually don't have it drawn down yes
[1:33:04] that's where needs to become a
[1:33:06] revelation yeah and God had showing
[1:33:07] David through the different experiences
[1:33:09] that he was with him God had proved to
[1:33:11] David and God proves to you week after
[1:33:13] week a little bit here a little bit
[1:33:14] there that he is with you he owns his
[1:33:17] prayer he undertakes in those times of
[1:33:19] trouble the times of need when everyone
[1:33:21] turns against you he is with you he was
[1:33:23] there to guide you to lead you he says
[1:33:27] in that day the scripture says in verse
[1:33:28] 46 this day will the Lord deliver thee
[1:33:31] into mine hand and I will smite thee and
[1:33:34] take that head from thee what confidence
[1:33:36] Hey what confidence he headed this devil
[1:33:39] this Giants and funnyman had no way of
[1:33:43] taking him out that day he was a mighty
[1:33:46] man of data he was someone that God had
[1:33:48] anointed for the job and he knew his God
[1:33:52] and I will give the get the
[1:33:56] caucuses of the host of the Philistines
[1:33:58] so it wasn't just Goliath it was the
[1:34:01] whole host of the Philistines those
[1:34:02] caucuses are all gonna be so he claimed
[1:34:04] the whole army was going to be taking it
[1:34:07] there not just this big boy
[1:34:09] I was mighty and take the hid from thee
[1:34:14] in the caucuses of the host of the
[1:34:16] Philistines this day unto the fowls of
[1:34:18] the air and to the wild beasts of the
[1:34:20] earth that all the Earth may know that
[1:34:23] there is a God in Israel David knew who
[1:34:26] he was he did not question if the
[1:34:29] Israelites were the chosen people of God
[1:34:30] Inuit he was so many of their dead
[1:34:33] seeing what his identity was and knew he
[1:34:37] could confess it it was not a fright
[1:34:41] prophet tells another story of their
[1:34:43] slave it was out was taken from Africa -
[1:34:47] out of his home raiment and then they
[1:34:49] were came upon with I wanted to come and
[1:34:52] buy some of the slaves and they went to
[1:34:53] never look over the slaves to see which
[1:34:55] ones they wanted to buy and there was
[1:34:57] this one young man that was always
[1:34:59] upright and you didn't have to beat him
[1:35:00] you didn't have to do anything to him he
[1:35:02] was just working and committed to
[1:35:04] everything that he did and in the slave
[1:35:06] trader came and said he wants to buy
[1:35:08] that one and he said he's not for sale
[1:35:11] why why is he not for sale why is he he
[1:35:15] looks different to the others do you
[1:35:16] feed him different do you do you do
[1:35:17] something different for him is he
[1:35:18] treated if it no he's treated the same
[1:35:20] every way and what did they you know
[1:35:23] awesome said why why is he like that and
[1:35:25] then the slave trader guy said oh I also
[1:35:28] wondered one day why why he was like it
[1:35:30] so I found out that he was the son of a
[1:35:34] king you back in his home country he was
[1:35:37] a king's son and that made him in a
[1:35:42] certain way presents himself in a
[1:35:44] certain way because he knew where his
[1:35:45] destiny he where he came from
[1:35:48] and that's what we need to see is where
[1:35:49] we come from this morning we come from
[1:35:52] gardening we can act and respond the
[1:35:54] same way this morning is the free
[1:35:56] already there because that is our
[1:35:58] identity this morning even though he was
[1:36:02] alienated in this world from his from
[1:36:06] his son hometown he still acted as
[1:36:11] though he was a king
[1:36:13] Brennan says it bother you all and now
[1:36:17] you're alienated in this world with sin
[1:36:20] and chaos is it is yet stick your chest
[1:36:23] stick out your chest and throw up your
[1:36:25] hands your sons and daughters of a king
[1:36:28] that's how true identity this morning we
[1:36:30] are sons and daughters of a king we
[1:36:33] don't need a walk around defeated we
[1:36:35] don't need to walk around with our heads
[1:36:36] down low and have the pressure of
[1:36:38] everything around us we are the sons and
[1:36:41] daughters of a king I have everything we
[1:36:43] have ever need of you might not have
[1:36:45] riches we might not have all the wealth
[1:36:46] of the world and a Lexi Daisy life but
[1:36:49] it's not what we here for
[1:36:51] we're here on this earth to build a
[1:36:53] character that's the only thing we're
[1:36:54] taking worth and in a comfortable
[1:36:56] environment there is no way character is
[1:36:58] both if everything is just given to you
[1:37:00] there is no character you've got to work
[1:37:02] for it we've got a sucker for it there
[1:37:03] is things that we've got to develop and
[1:37:06] God allow certain situations to come our
[1:37:08] way so let's develop a character is
[1:37:10] because we need character in order to
[1:37:13] rank it's a value of our identity we go
[1:37:18] through times as I've said sometimes the
[1:37:20] news identification eyes get dimmed over
[1:37:23] and foamed over we get what we call a
[1:37:25] temporary amnesia we forget what
[1:37:27] actually we are due to those pressures
[1:37:29] and do two different things I feel that
[1:37:32] same way many times
[1:37:33] I'm the one that escapes this if not I
[1:37:37] maybe get it the worst get it hard it
[1:37:39] just comes to me so much that the
[1:37:41] pressure comes on whatever and you you
[1:37:43] get them Dover because of whatever the
[1:37:45] circumstances may be but from we can
[1:37:48] just step back and start a look at it
[1:37:49] from God's perspective look at the
[1:37:51] bigger picture and see their God it's
[1:37:53] got everything under control
[1:37:58] somehow as we go through these difficult
[1:38:01] times and the hard things somehow the
[1:38:03] grace of God brings us out on the other
[1:38:05] side
[1:38:06] we get a glimpse of the light and we get
[1:38:09] it breaks through we realize God is
[1:38:11] still with us the God is still in
[1:38:13] control God is everything will work out
[1:38:17] right with God
[1:38:19] Philippians 1:6 says being confident of
[1:38:22] this very thing that he which hath begun
[1:38:24] a good work in you will perform it until
[1:38:27] the day of Jesus Christ no matter what
[1:38:30] the outside looks like what your brother
[1:38:33] or sister is going through if God has
[1:38:36] started the work in that person he will
[1:38:38] finish it no matter what it is no matter
[1:38:41] how difficult it is oh wow Baxter than a
[1:38:43] brother or sister might be oh how
[1:38:44] hardships they going through it does not
[1:38:46] matter God has started that work he will
[1:38:49] patient if not for us is not for us to
[1:38:52] come and try and correct or fix that
[1:38:54] brother it's not our duty to try and
[1:38:56] make them better Christians it's our
[1:38:58] duty to get on our knees and call out to
[1:39:00] God and say Lord I see my brother and
[1:39:03] sister in this condition would you be
[1:39:04] merciful to him not stand on a side and
[1:39:07] criticize and touch this one in charge a
[1:39:09] one-celled effing serpent see because
[1:39:11] they're doing this this one is not
[1:39:12] longer than the message because they do
[1:39:14] they expose it you got nothing to do
[1:39:16] with it that's not the attribute of
[1:39:17] Christ the end of you know Christ will
[1:39:19] come an intersession for that way in the
[1:39:21] coming of the seed and come together and
[1:39:23] say we need a pray for this fight this
[1:39:25] pray they said get together and really
[1:39:27] put out praise for these ones Thanks
[1:39:31] Christ and being confident that he will
[1:39:34] bring it out don't focus on the
[1:39:36] negatives then focus on those things
[1:39:38] especially parents of children you see
[1:39:40] the thing and you expect them to act
[1:39:41] like an adult you expect them to be as
[1:39:43] as mature a Christian is what you are
[1:39:45] and they do this study thing on that
[1:39:47] sort of thing and we really call them
[1:39:48] and we break them down that's not a
[1:39:51] thing to be doing as parents we need to
[1:39:52] be encouraging them and and just help
[1:39:55] them not say turn a blind eye to any of
[1:39:57] the sinful things but through love show
[1:40:00] them the right way and allow them they
[1:40:02] need you ever an environment where they
[1:40:04] can make their decisions and maybe make
[1:40:06] a mistake so they can learn from it it's
[1:40:09] not wrong if they make a mistake because
[1:40:10] each one of us make mistakes and we
[1:40:12] don't want God there to come and whip us
[1:40:14] every time if we can learn from
[1:40:17] and he can encourage us and help us so
[1:40:22] we need to accept what God thinks of us
[1:40:24] but he has said we are we must identify
[1:40:27] with that and not what Satan wants us to
[1:40:29] believe we are a part of that original
[1:40:33] you're part of that original diamond if
[1:40:35] you take a diamond and you chip it off
[1:40:36] and you chip their diamond up into
[1:40:38] smaller diamonds all the attributes that
[1:40:40] was in their diamond is in those little
[1:40:41] ones
[1:40:42] nothing is anything less that's all
[1:40:44] there and we come from it great diamond
[1:40:45] we all chipped off of that great one
[1:40:48] you're a part of that so we reflect back
[1:40:51] those attributes because that is what is
[1:40:53] within us in the message in the future
[1:41:02] change it says a true Church of Jesus
[1:41:04] Christ the bride is like into pure gold
[1:41:07] her righteousness is his righteousness
[1:41:10] we have no righteousness alone the Lord
[1:41:13] is not one thing has to have
[1:41:14] righteousness self-righteousness
[1:41:16] he says his righteousness he gives they
[1:41:19] done to us her attributes are his his
[1:41:23] own glorious attributes her identity is
[1:41:26] found in heaven what he is she is to
[1:41:29] reflect so we do not produce anything of
[1:41:33] ourselves we are just a reflection of
[1:41:35] their great Sun as a moon reflects the
[1:41:38] sunlight so do we reflect the Sun we
[1:41:41] don't have anything of ourselves we
[1:41:43] don't bring anything of ourselves we
[1:41:44] have no light of our own we only reflect
[1:41:48] what Christ is he says her identity is
[1:41:53] found in him what he is
[1:41:54] she is to reflect what he has she is to
[1:41:58] manifest there is no fault in her she is
[1:42:01] all glorious within and without from
[1:42:05] beginning to end
[1:42:06] she is the work of the law of her of her
[1:42:09] Lord and all his works are perfect the
[1:42:13] Lord does not do a half job everything
[1:42:16] he does is perfect so if he has started
[1:42:19] a work in your life
[1:42:20] you're perfect that's the way he sees
[1:42:23] you he's perfect and that's image that
[1:42:25] he has of you is your perfect perfect
[1:42:28] image it is in all his works are perfect
[1:42:31] in fact in her is summed up and
[1:42:34] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:42:37] purpose of God
[1:42:38] how can one Featherman how can one
[1:42:41] understand it though we cannot do that
[1:42:44] we can accept it by faith who God has
[1:42:47] spoken how can we accept this great
[1:42:50] miraculous seeing the God of creation
[1:42:52] and put the whole earth into in orbits
[1:42:54] and everything like that this great God
[1:42:56] how can we be like him
[1:42:57] it's not for us to figure it out of a
[1:43:00] feather minute it says the prophecies we
[1:43:01] are unable to fathom in our there's no
[1:43:03] way we could have a reason little guess
[1:43:04] at all or try and make it up says we can
[1:43:06] only accept it there is no way to
[1:43:09] understand it
[1:43:10] Amazing Grace that all it is the word
[1:43:13] needs to become the most important thing
[1:43:15] in our lives this cannot happen unless
[1:43:19] you identify yourself with the word the
[1:43:23] Prophet says here we can accept it by
[1:43:25] faith until we can identify that there
[1:43:27] is us that the word is talking about
[1:43:28] then it becomes a reality then it
[1:43:31] becomes a revelation and God reveals
[1:43:33] that and sinks a deep down into your
[1:43:35] heart that you're a part of him that
[1:43:36] you're a part of that word then you can
[1:43:40] March forth as true Victor's it's often
[1:43:45] listen to what people say you know
[1:43:48] listen to what Satan says your place
[1:43:51] there in a higher value higher regard
[1:43:53] instead of what God says about you we
[1:43:56] listen when a brother might come in but
[1:43:57] somebody might say something to you that
[1:43:59] maybe it's hurtful and you place there
[1:44:01] because of whatever the reason is above
[1:44:03] God point of view of you of God's fact
[1:44:07] of what you are and what God a said of
[1:44:09] who you are in the end it is God's
[1:44:12] thoughts towards us that counts of our
[1:44:18] own ways and then God is the one it's
[1:44:20] the judge God is the one that has said
[1:44:22] something about you no matter what
[1:44:23] somebody else comes up against you just
[1:44:25] say for the scripture says in Jeremiah
[1:44:28] 29:11 it says for I know the thoughts
[1:44:29] that I had toward you saith the Lord
[1:44:32] thoughts of peace and
[1:44:34] not of evil to give you an expected
[1:44:36] these thoughts towards you is not to
[1:44:38] have you an evil thought or to bring you
[1:44:41] to destruction but it's to bring you to
[1:44:43] an expected end in an end with him in
[1:44:45] glory
[1:44:45] that's what is affecting so you might go
[1:44:48] through hard times to break a certain
[1:44:49] stubborn nature that you might have the
[1:44:51] Lord needs to get that out so then you
[1:44:53] might think all the Lord doesn't care
[1:44:54] about me but no he does care so much you
[1:44:57] just don't understand from his
[1:44:59] perspective and how yet she loves you
[1:45:01] and what he is trying to achieve in your
[1:45:03] life man's ideas of you will fade people
[1:45:07] will come and go God will always remain
[1:45:10] the same and what he said about you will
[1:45:13] never change his love you will never
[1:45:16] change no matter how much bad you do or
[1:45:18] how much good you do you can never gain
[1:45:19] more favor and be less favored in his
[1:45:21] side you are the apple of his heart this
[1:45:23] morning you are the chosen bride of
[1:45:25] Christ nothing can take that away you're
[1:45:28] elected and predestinated fed no
[1:45:31] condemnation that's what Romans 8:1 says
[1:45:34] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:45:35] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[1:45:37] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:45:39] spirit once we had that Spirit of Christ
[1:45:42] in us and we walk after that there is no
[1:45:44] more combination this is what the Lord
[1:45:45] says this is what he says about us we
[1:45:48] are that you're justified Romans 3:20
[1:45:56] forces being justified freely by His
[1:45:59] grace through the redemption that is in
[1:46:01] Christ Jesus justified freely just as if
[1:46:07] you've never done it it means that
[1:46:11] you've never sinned in the first place
[1:46:12] God wipes it so far from his memory that
[1:46:15] it doesn't exist anymore no matter how
[1:46:18] filthy your background is once you come
[1:46:20] to Christ and you repent of your wrongs
[1:46:23] he washes and you cleanse there is
[1:46:27] nothing that the devil can accuse your
[1:46:29] God does not remember that again so he
[1:46:31] cannot the devil will accuse you don't
[1:46:33] let him get by with that he will he will
[1:46:36] sit there every day and run and bring it
[1:46:38] back to your remembrance to try and
[1:46:39] bring you break down your confidence and
[1:46:40] who you are but God does not remember it
[1:46:43] that's why this is your just
[1:46:45] freely by His grace the grace of God to
[1:46:48] you you're justified in first
[1:46:54] Corinthians 6 verses tennessee's nor
[1:46:56] thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor
[1:46:58] revilers or exhorting us shall inherit
[1:47:01] the kingdom of God none of those things
[1:47:03] well inheriting is a lot more other
[1:47:05] things before this in verse 9 that many
[1:47:07] of us is now Paul says you will see this
[1:47:09] this is in such inversive him and such
[1:47:12] with some of you many of us were those
[1:47:17] things above we were caught up in those
[1:47:19] things we were trapped in those things
[1:47:21] from our birth from what we were born
[1:47:23] into we come into this world speaking
[1:47:24] lies we are born in trapped in this
[1:47:26] sinful nature we automatically went that
[1:47:29] direction that he goes in he says but ye
[1:47:32] are washed but he are sanctified so he
[1:47:36] doesn't only wash you he also not
[1:47:38] sanctified you all but he are justified
[1:47:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the
[1:47:44] spirit of our God
[1:47:45] so then all those things that we had
[1:47:47] done in our past is gone the slate is
[1:47:49] clean we can stand here victorious
[1:47:53] [Music]
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:55] that's what God thinks of us so not too
[1:47:59] far from wrapping up I have a a little
[1:48:01] bit of a longest quote only to read but
[1:48:03] I feel this just sums up how God thinks
[1:48:06] about us as his bride it's from the
[1:48:09] message the invisible union of the Bride
[1:48:11] of Christ I do have it up on there so
[1:48:13] we'll go through the few slides just
[1:48:16] listen to what the Prophet is saying
[1:48:18] this is his message to the church just
[1:48:19] before he goes off the scene
[1:48:21] this is 6511 he's got a month left and
[1:48:24] this is what the Lord is wanting to tell
[1:48:26] you this is how much importance he has
[1:48:29] placed on you let's read this this
[1:48:32] morning he says he the bridegroom took
[1:48:35] away your shame and put it in the sea of
[1:48:37] forgetfulness about the washing of the
[1:48:39] water of the word and the blood of life
[1:48:43] that's what the Bible said your first
[1:48:46] husband that you were married to the
[1:48:48] world the anointed bride room which
[1:48:50] foreordained you has washed you by the
[1:48:54] washing of the water
[1:48:56] since by the church this is not the
[1:48:58] Congressional says that don't sound
[1:49:01] right doesn't know you might find that
[1:49:03] in an almanac but not in God's Bible by
[1:49:07] washing of the water by the word in the
[1:49:10] word see it goes on you're a standing
[1:49:16] completely justified as though you never
[1:49:18] did it at the beginning this is my
[1:49:21] message to the church this is message to
[1:49:25] the church listen if you are the Church
[1:49:27] of Christ with a capital C you are the
[1:49:29] bride this is the prophets message to
[1:49:31] you he's saying as you as we go off the
[1:49:37] air just in a minute you're standing if
[1:49:39] you're standing on God's Word and with
[1:49:42] God's Word every man every Amen every
[1:49:45] jot every tittle where you're standing
[1:49:48] I'm trying to tell you pull away from
[1:49:50] the shock and get out here in the wheat
[1:49:53] where you can get right before the Sun I
[1:49:55] hear the coming of the combine you're
[1:49:58] standing complete justified like you
[1:50:00] never did it in the first place
[1:50:02] hallelujah talk about Thanksgiving I
[1:50:04] feel real good I'm more thankful for
[1:50:07] that than anything I know it's better
[1:50:16] than the Thanksgiving off that they were
[1:50:17] celebrating their time of the year in
[1:50:19] the state's sees you are the pure
[1:50:23] virtuous sinless bride of the Son of the
[1:50:25] Living God this is God's view of who you
[1:50:30] are
[1:50:31] every man every every woman born of the
[1:50:35] Spirit of God and washed in the blood of
[1:50:37] Jesus Christ and believes every word of
[1:50:39] God stands as though that you never send
[1:50:42] at the first place you are perfect the
[1:50:44] blood of crisis Christ how can you if a
[1:50:47] man if I was supposed to die in the
[1:50:49] morning and a man took my place I cannot
[1:50:51] die for that sin somebody took my place
[1:50:53] he's saying that if somebody's took your
[1:50:55] place and stood there to die for you why
[1:50:57] would you need to die okay he came and
[1:51:00] took your place he stood there and said
[1:51:02] I will take all your sin upon our die
[1:51:04] for you that you can go
[1:51:06] that's what it is so you can never die
[1:51:09] because he had paid that ultimate price
[1:51:12] for you in Jesus the word took my place
[1:51:20] he became me that sinner that I might
[1:51:22] become him the word Amen let me hold
[1:51:25] true to it not the church the word Amen
[1:51:28] oh the spiritual union of Christ and his
[1:51:31] bride now when the flesh is becoming
[1:51:33] word and the word is becoming flesh
[1:51:35] manifested vindicated just what the
[1:51:37] Bible said would happen in this day it's
[1:51:40] happening day by day why it's the
[1:51:42] culminating so it's culminating so fast
[1:51:44] out there in those deserts and the thing
[1:51:46] is taking place that I couldn't even
[1:51:48] keep up with it we are near the coming
[1:51:51] of Jesus to be united with his church
[1:51:53] where the word becomes a word you know
[1:51:58] it's word becoming that word again we
[1:52:00] are at spoken word call of the holy
[1:52:05] spirit searching the hearts the last one
[1:52:08] on us but it says you're standing
[1:52:12] completely you are standing completely
[1:52:15] you never sinned at the first place the
[1:52:18] who don't even know it's in the sea of
[1:52:20] forgetfulness you never did it you were
[1:52:24] accused of it by the accuser but really
[1:52:27] from the beginning you were
[1:52:29] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:52:31] of God you're standing there washed and
[1:52:33] you're old book of divorcement is put
[1:52:35] away and it is dead absolutely out of
[1:52:38] existence even in the mind of God you
[1:52:41] are virtuous you're the virtuous Bride
[1:52:43] of Christ washed in the Bride of Christ
[1:52:46] precious purchase sinless son of God
[1:52:48] standing without with a pure
[1:52:51] unadulterated bride word that he washed
[1:52:54] by the water of his own blood that
[1:52:56] become flesh and manifested that he
[1:52:58] might take you which will predict
[1:53:02] podesta nature in the bosom of the
[1:53:03] Father before the beginning the same as
[1:53:06] he was he was the great attribute of God
[1:53:09] called love this sums up God's
[1:53:13] identification of you this is how God
[1:53:16] feels about you
[1:53:17] morning this is what he was so are we
[1:53:20] taking what saying I say Satan is saying
[1:53:22] which voice do you place more value on
[1:53:24] this way are we going to believe the
[1:53:26] report of the Lord are we going to
[1:53:27] repeat the report of Satan are we going
[1:53:30] to believe the report of the accuser or
[1:53:32] what the report of what the Lord has
[1:53:34] spoken through the Prophet to us and
[1:53:36] Hebrews Pollard greets us he says
[1:53:39] wherefore holy brethren how are we holy
[1:53:42] in ourselves we love sin but he sees you
[1:53:46] the way God sees you Paul identify this
[1:53:48] is holy brethren partakers of the
[1:53:51] heavenly calling he identifies you as a
[1:53:54] holy and identify you as holy this
[1:53:57] morning forget about your mistakes
[1:53:59] forget about those things they took you
[1:54:01] up this morning even coming to children
[1:54:03] you've confessed it that is gone God
[1:54:06] sees you perfect sinless virtuous that's
[1:54:10] what is but no the devil wants to bring
[1:54:12] a fear upon you he wants to bring a
[1:54:14] doubt so that you don't see your true
[1:54:15] identity to make you that man of Valor
[1:54:18] in this hour he is trying to strip that
[1:54:20] thing away through you through fear
[1:54:22] that's exactly what he does because
[1:54:27] prophecies if you can ever get the scare
[1:54:29] out of the church and let them realize
[1:54:31] who they are and what they are
[1:54:33] positionally healing will be the
[1:54:36] simplest message to be preached or
[1:54:38] anything else but you're scared you're
[1:54:40] afraid you don't realize that your sons
[1:54:43] and daughters of God and now not we will
[1:54:46] be we are now science not something in
[1:54:50] the future you are now you build again
[1:54:53] you are now the sons in Georgia you know
[1:54:55] you came from him you're just now
[1:54:56] accepting you you attribute now the
[1:54:58] manifestation of it says God not way off
[1:55:02] in the future and we and we won't some
[1:55:05] time in the future set in heavenly
[1:55:07] places now we are seated in heavenly
[1:55:09] places right now now we are the sons and
[1:55:13] daughters of God it doesn't not yet
[1:55:17] appear that we shall be in the egg but
[1:55:20] we know we will see him for will have a
[1:55:23] body like his
[1:55:25] you'll see him as he is so that's my
[1:55:28] message this morning to you is just to
[1:55:30] identify who you really are to show you
[1:55:33] the value that God places on your
[1:55:35] identity on who you are because it's his
[1:55:38] identity you're a part of him and that
[1:55:40] means so much to him he can never let
[1:55:42] one of his get lost
[1:55:43] does that help of us stressing and
[1:55:45] worrying and concerning about this one
[1:55:47] gone this way or that one gone this way
[1:55:49] or our children are not saved yet or God
[1:55:53] we can rest in that they will come upon
[1:55:55] we can be like a Rahab and we'll take
[1:55:58] their token and you'll bring it in your
[1:56:00] house and your family will be safe bring
[1:56:03] them in
[1:56:03] show them the love of God and God will
[1:56:05] work in those hearts you will never lose
[1:56:07] one of his own we cannot save our
[1:56:09] children and that's the thing we cannot
[1:56:11] bring them up with that thing saying
[1:56:14] that yo
[1:56:15] there is nothing wrong with you you're
[1:56:16] fine you there do they need to raise up
[1:56:18] as a children and realize that they're
[1:56:20] born in sin the shapes in iniquity that
[1:56:22] they need a Savior but the out there
[1:56:24] evolution of knowing that they born in
[1:56:26] their condition and all contact them on
[1:56:27] otherwise it's self-righteousness I'm
[1:56:29] doing okay everything's fine but I'm
[1:56:32] really below it all they need to realize
[1:56:36] if they need a Savior and that's what
[1:56:38] Christ has come and then we can identify
[1:56:40] now with this Messiah we hire them right
[1:56:43] of Christ we are the chosen ones we are
[1:56:46] victorious
[1:56:46] we are they virtuous bride this morning
[1:56:50] so this trust has been an encouragement
[1:56:51] to use we can just um maybe bow our
