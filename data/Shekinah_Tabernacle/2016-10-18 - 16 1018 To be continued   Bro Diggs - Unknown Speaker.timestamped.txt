[34:56] if I'm in the right place Lord I need to
[34:58] know my next step God speak to me
[35:02] hallelujah amen think about how
[35:04] refreshing that is when you come to
[35:07] church and God talks to you oh I love
[35:10] that when it happens but you know I I
[35:12] just want to I just want to uplift you
[35:14] tonight church because I've heard some
[35:16] of the testimonies and I believe God is
[35:18] doing something in
[35:19] willing Hallelujah I believe he's not
[35:23] done amen I believe he wants to use some
[35:25] of you amen but you got to want to be
[35:28] used you got to say Lord here am I what
[35:31] will you have me to
[35:33] do Hallelujah but you know church is
[35:36] tonight by God's grace my subject is is
[35:39] it may sound kind of strange but I I I I
[35:43] just want to express something to you
[35:44] like God gave it to me and my subject
[35:46] tonight is in a couple of words to be
[35:50] continued
[35:52] Amen to be continued
[35:58] and most of us
[35:59] tonight we're here because God has been
[36:02] dealing with us and I want to say to you
[36:06] that's not just that one particular time
[36:09] when he when he uh introduced himself
[36:12] and maybe he changed your life maybe you
[36:14] were you were in the world and you were
[36:16] doing worldly things and then God came
[36:18] in and and you were delivered from
[36:21] something and you're like wow God is so
[36:23] great I'm going to church it's not over
[36:26] amen more of God hallelujah to be
[36:30] revealed amen and that's what the
[36:32] subject means tonight amen when it comes
[36:34] to your life you have to tell the devil
[36:37] that the picture is not over amen
[36:39] hallelujah there may be a part one but
[36:42] there's also a part two and sometimes
[36:45] the sequel gets all the way to part five
[36:47] or part six or part seven but what part
[36:50] are you in amen you ought to be able to
[36:53] say to the enemy God is not done with me
[36:56] amen there is is a day to be continued
[36:59] amen that there is more of God there's
[37:02] more of God I want to see there's more
[37:04] of God I'm craving there's more of God I
[37:07] need God to do in my life my life is a
[37:10] continual unveiling of God's grace
[37:14] Hallelujah and God has always been that
[37:17] place God has never stopped
[37:20] moving Hallelujah so this this is
[37:23] basically like a a stee of the grace of
[37:26] God you know when we look at the
[37:28] scriptures we look at what we read and
[37:31] sometimes we wonder you know are we
[37:33] where we supposed to be well I ask you
[37:35] that question Hallelujah are you where
[37:37] you supposed to be what is God doing in
[37:40] your life yeah or are you just satisfied
[37:42] with a good
[37:43] church to be
[37:46] continent Hallelujah there should be
[37:48] more of God hallelujah you should be
[37:51] grabbing for more of God Amen there
[37:54] should be a hunger a desire for more of
[37:57] God but you know as a evangelist what I
[38:00] found out is that people get satisfied
[38:02] with just coming to
[38:04] church it's more than just coming to
[38:07] church that's right it's it's all about
[38:09] a relationship it's all about Christ
[38:11] becoming tangible amen everything that
[38:14] you read everything that you listen to
[38:16] it becomes a lifestyle you know that's
[38:19] why diets don't work right
[38:23] amen diets don't work because people do
[38:26] not change their life
[38:27] St they shock their systems and they may
[38:31] lose some weight and they may get a
[38:32] little healthy but they don't get rid of
[38:35] the junk food Hallelujah they don't they
[38:38] don't uh become enemies with the junk
[38:40] owl at the grocery store right but they
[38:43] keep venturing back and going back into
[38:45] those places and the weight continues to
[38:47] come back why because they don't change
[38:50] their lifestyle and that's what we have
[38:52] to do church when God deals with you you
[38:55] don't just get complacent Hallelujah God
[38:58] is telling the devil the devil will see
[39:00] you he'll see you settling down but God
[39:04] is in his ear saying to be continued
[39:07] right I'm not done with them there's
[39:10] more that I want to show the world
[39:12] Hallelujah there's more inside of that
[39:14] seed that hasn't been revealed yet
[39:18] Hallelujah think about that church when
[39:20] you were in the world you were in the
[39:22] club Hallelujah the devil was looking at
[39:24] you saying you're this and you're that
[39:26] and God is saying what I'm not finished
[39:29] to be continued amen you may have messed
[39:32] up and messed up bad and Satan said I
[39:34] got them and God was say nope there's
[39:36] another
[39:37] scene nope there's another sequel NOP
[39:40] there's another part of the script to
[39:42] their life Satan this is not over like
[39:46] we say back home in our own Southern
[39:48] slang it ain't over amen hallelujah and
[39:53] that's where you ought to say right now
[39:55] amen no matter how you feel no matter
[39:59] what your shortcoming may be you ought
[40:01] to say to the devil it ain't
[40:05] over over I'm still hungering for God
[40:09] hallelujah there's still something down
[40:11] on the inside that's craving the mighty
[40:14] one amen there's still more deliverance
[40:17] from me amen see one thing about
[40:19] medicine Hallelujah you can have
[40:21] medicine amen if you hold it and you let
[40:24] it sit in one place so long all of the
[40:27] things that's that'll make that that
[40:29] that that medicine work it falls to the
[40:32] bottom right and it gets
[40:34] settled and everything around it is no
[40:38] good all the power of that medicine
[40:42] settles in the
[40:43] bottom and the only way you can use that
[40:46] is if you shake it up
[40:50] right Hallelujah am Hallelujah you don't
[40:54] just pour it in the spoon that's right
[40:57] no Shake It Up first hallelu and the
[40:59] instructions are shake well H you can't
[41:02] just and then put it no you got
[41:06] Hallelujah and sometimes believe it or
[41:08] not God has to shake you up God has to
[41:12] shake up your life Lord God has to
[41:15] sometimes allow you to go astray and
[41:17] Chase your own dreams Hallelujah so he
[41:20] can shake you upen and bring you back
[41:23] hallelujah hallelujah see I know what
[41:25] I'm talking about amen that's been a
[41:27] time in my life where God had to shake
[41:30] me up amen hallelujah sitting in church
[41:33] amen not really getting anything from
[41:35] God but then God let me run astray
[41:37] Hallelujah to Chase my own dreams and my
[41:39] own thought P only to allow me to get
[41:43] tired and once I got tired Hallelujah I
[41:46] went back to God and you know what he
[41:48] was saying to the devil you thought it
[41:50] was
[41:51] over but it was to be continued
[41:54] hallelujah it's like a Batman and Robin
[41:57] movie Hallelujah you know back in the
[41:59] day when we used to watch that amen
[42:01] they'd be right in the middle of a fight
[42:03] scene and Batman and Robin would be all
[42:05] tied up and it looked like they were
[42:07] going to be they were going to be
[42:08] destroyed or something and then those
[42:10] words came across the stream to be
[42:15] continue what did that do that put you
[42:18] in expectation that's right that made
[42:21] you want to see the outcome that made
[42:24] you say it's not over Hallelujah and God
[42:26] is doing that right before the devil's
[42:29] eyes the devil looks like he has some of
[42:32] you all tied up but God is saying to be
[42:39] continued Hallelujah let me say it like
[42:42] this church your enemy God created
[42:46] him that's right amen that's right
[42:49] Hallelujah anybody going through a
[42:52] struggle about three of
[42:55] you so the rest of you are already in
[42:57] the
[42:59] Rapture Hallelujah goad amen I think God
[43:05] for my trials and tribulation amen
[43:08] because what those trial let's read the
[43:10] scripture to be continued Genesis the
[43:13] third
[43:19] chapter Genesis
[43:22] three now the devil seems like he has so
[43:26] much power
[43:28] you I get
[43:33] amen do I have a church in here tonight
[43:36] amen I say can I get an amen hallelujah
[43:39] amen means so be amen amen means I agree
[43:43] Hallelujah and you know the preacher
[43:45] loves
[43:47] amen hallelujah so that lets me know
[43:50] that you are appreciate the word of God
[43:52] that's right so whenever I hear the word
[43:55] and it's channeling through what I need
[43:57] I say amen hallelujah because what I'm
[43:59] doing I'm expressing to God that I agree
[44:03] and that that word hallelujah is now
[44:05] being applied to my life so I say amen
[44:08] hallelujah amen and you know church as I
[44:10] look at the scripture you know and I
[44:12] begin to think about this this
[44:14] particular scene of to be continued you
[44:17] know it it it we we we look in Genesis
[44:20] and we know the story of Adam and Eve
[44:23] and how creation fell and then once they
[44:26] fa Satan he looked like he did a good
[44:30] job he looked like what he wanted to
[44:32] accomplish he accomplished it you know
[44:35] he he he was kicked out of heaven
[44:38] amen amen we we we know that he he was
[44:42] once in heaven he was once an anointed
[44:45] chub he was once God's right-handed man
[44:49] God put him in that
[44:52] position Hallelujah think about that God
[44:55] let his enemy be so close to him
[44:59] Hallelujah so close to him that he this
[45:03] is about to be powerful now he let his
[45:05] enemy get so close to him that his enemy
[45:08] would want to be just like
[45:12] him when you look at the Devil you look
[45:15] at Lucifer you read your scriptures he's
[45:18] not some just wild animal wild beast he
[45:21] wants to be like
[45:23] God everything about him wants to be
[45:26] like God Satan wants to be worshiped
[45:29] Satan wants to have a church Satan wants
[45:31] his own Seed where does he get that from
[45:33] he wants to be just like God and he'll
[45:36] tell us don't pray don't read your Bible
[45:40] don't have communion with God he'll tell
[45:42] us don't desire to be like God when he
[45:45] wants to be just like God a't that such
[45:48] a hypocrite yeah
[45:51] amen your enemy is such a hypocrite
[45:54] he'll come to you and tell you all these
[45:57] things about God when he wants to be
[45:59] just like God what a hypocrite so you
[46:02] know what you ought to do when Satan's
[46:04] talking to him you ought to say shut
[46:07] upen the very thing you're telling me
[46:10] not to do you're going to go do that's
[46:13] right
[46:15] amen think about that the very thing
[46:18] Satan tells us not to do to try to get
[46:20] close to God it's is is his own desire
[46:24] right Hallelujah he wants to be H H high
[46:28] and lifted up like the most high he
[46:31] wants his Stars exalted like the most
[46:33] high he want his own church like the
[46:36] most high he want his seed like the most
[46:38] high he wants his music like the most
[46:41] high that's right everything about him
[46:43] Hallelujah he wants to be a replica of
[46:46] your God that's
[46:48] right amen that's right but we look at
[46:52] him he was kicked out of he was kicked
[46:54] out of heaven why
[46:57] because iniquity was found in his heart
[47:01] what is Iniquity iniquity is knowing to
[47:03] do right and do wrong and a lot of times
[47:07] we fall in that category amen we're
[47:09] riding down the road down here and the
[47:11] thing says 100 kilometers and we're
[47:14] thinking 100 miles per hour but it means
[47:17] kilometers so that's something different
[47:19] amen see nor to do right and we still do
[47:23] wrong you know that's iniquity amen and
[47:25] you know we have to Die daily we have to
[47:28] ask God for forgiveness daily so God is
[47:31] giv us a script of
[47:34] continuation God has given us a script
[47:36] where Satan can't keep us in a sinful
[47:39] condition because God gives us a way to
[47:42] repent God gives us a way to make it
[47:44] right God gives us a way where we can
[47:47] stay in his presence amen that's why God
[47:50] is longsuffering because he knows that
[47:52] there's still people who hasn't come
[47:54] full circle yet that belong to him amen
[47:58] hallelujah the grace of God hallelujah
[48:01] is longsuffering because it's not his
[48:03] will that any should perish but that all
[48:05] come to repentance think about it
[48:08] Hallelujah the prophet of God said years
[48:10] ago back in the 60s he said the Rapture
[48:13] should have already taken
[48:16] place think about that he says the
[48:19] Rapture should have already taken place
[48:21] but it couldn't you know why it couldn't
[48:24] because we wern't ready amen amen
[48:27] hallelujah amen we wasn't ready
[48:30] Hallelujah you say Brother D I wasn't
[48:32] born we Wen ready amen hallelujah I
[48:35] wasn't here yet there was a part of me a
[48:38] part of you that had to manifest who God
[48:41] was because only in our day the full
[48:44] word could come the full expression of
[48:47] God and you are a part of that
[48:49] expression so God had to have a
[48:52] continuation of his grace Hallelujah for
[48:55] each and every one of us to grab hold of
[48:57] that word and say now I got it
[49:00] Hallelujah say away with the alcohol
[49:03] away with the lust away with the lying
[49:05] away with the cheating now I got my
[49:07] portion of God now let me reveal it
[49:10] Hallelujah let me be what God has made
[49:12] me H church we are the continuation of
[49:16] William Brown's
[49:20] M we are the
[49:23] continuation of redemption Hallelujah
[49:26] Redemption is a coming out and a going
[49:28] into amen hallelujah Moses Hallelujah
[49:31] had a coming out he was the coming out
[49:33] of redemption but Joshua was the going
[49:36] into Hallelujah John the Baptist was the
[49:39] calling out but Jesus was the going into
[49:42] Hallelujah Elisha was the calling out
[49:44] but Elisha was the going into William
[49:47] bream was the calling out but we that
[49:50] bride are the going into a
[49:53] Redemption Hallelujah we are that
[49:56] Rapture
[49:58] anointing we are that seven seal Church
[50:02] age talking bride of
[50:04] Christ that's
[50:06] right y forgive me I get excited about

[50:13] have to study your message because if
[50:16] you don't these things will be forign to
[50:18] you don't just settle with a good church
[50:21] right amen don't just s oh praise God I
[50:25] don't smoke anymore there more to God
[50:28] than just not smoking amen or not
[50:31] drinking amen or not clubbing amen it's
[50:35] a lifestyle Hallelujah and this is one
[50:39] diet if you ever get on it it'll change
[50:42] your
[50:46] [Music]
[50:48] body it'll change you from Mortal to
[50:52] immortality amen it'll change your bones
[50:56] it'll change your heart it'll change
[50:58] your lungs it'll change your eyes and
[51:01] your ears you'll see God and hear God
[51:04] wouldn't you want a diet like that
[51:08] hallelujah thank God for the word but
[51:11] you know church when I look at this I
[51:12] see that
[51:14] Satan he caused the fall amen that's
[51:18] right you know he got into
[51:20] creation but he didn't know and I've
[51:23] been saying this
[51:24] lately Satan is not a SM as you
[51:28] think and I'm going to be bold enough to
[51:31] say you dumb
[51:36] devil because when he got into creation
[51:40] he wanted to mess up God's plan because
[51:43] Adam and Eve were perfect amen they were
[51:46] perfect they knew no sin they knew no
[51:49] wrong they were perfect Adam was created
[51:51] in the image and likeness of God he
[51:55] wasn't like the animal
[51:57] no he had God's mind that's right he had
[52:00] God's
[52:01] personality he had God's Voice
[52:06] Hallelujah Adam had God's Voice
[52:10] Hallelujah when the animals took notice
[52:12] that God was on the Earth where was he
[52:15] in Adam amen and God came and told Adam
[52:18] I want you to name all creation am and
[52:22] you know God wasn't there whispering in
[52:23] his ear that's a that's a that's no God
[52:27] stood off and God just watched his
[52:30] creation
[52:31] operate he watched his mind in Adam
[52:35] operate Hallelujah all right Hallelujah

[1:13:05] Hallelujah Abraham says I the L goingon
[1:13:08] to go and I the L gonna come back God

[1:13:12] inspiration in his life that God cannot
[1:13:15] fail me amen hallelujah then they get up
[1:13:18] on the top of the mountain Hallelujah
[1:13:20] and Isaac says Daddy Daddy I see I see I

[1:24:33] chairs over Hallelujah to know that even
[1:24:35] the things I'm going through God is in

[1:26:04] righten hallelujah

[1:33:16] die to myself I live in christall that's
[1:33:20] right let me stop cuz I keep going
[1:33:22] Hallelujah
[1:33:24] but Church our life is supposed to be a
[1:33:26] continuation amen that's why you heard
[1:33:28] the prophet of God say we are supposed
[1:33:31] to be another book of
[1:33:36] Acts we're supposed to be the
[1:33:39] continuation of the Holy Ghost given to
[1:33:41] the
[1:33:43] believer and this is what I love what he
[1:33:44] said he said if that tree ever pushes
[1:33:47] out another Branch amen yes sir it'll be
[1:33:50] just like the book
[1:33:52] amen won't be something different it
[1:33:55] won't be a bunch of preachers arguing
[1:33:56] over Doctrine it'll be another book of
[1:34:00] Acts when you when they when they see us
[1:34:02] they say man they've been with Jesus
[1:34:04] Hallelujah that what they did in the
[1:34:06] book of Acts when they saw man men are
[1:34:09] ignorant and unlearned Hallelujah the
[1:34:11] wives don't work the brothers ain't got
[1:34:13] no good jobs he say but I know one thing
[1:34:15] they' been with
[1:34:17] Jesus hallah Hallelujah glory and it say
[1:34:22] it's a notable Mar Miracle that's taking
[1:34:25] place this man we know that was blind
[1:34:27] now he see amen of course they've been
[1:34:30] with Jesus and we got to be careful how
[1:34:33] we handle
[1:34:34] them so Church your life is supposed to
[1:34:37] be a
[1:34:39] continuation don't get settled with just
[1:34:42] living a good life a good nice life
[1:34:45] right the Muslims do that amen the
[1:34:48] Buddhist can do that and they can do it
[1:34:50] better than us right right told me where
[1:34:54] you go in the airport you see a Muslim
[1:34:55] woman she's covered from head to toe
[1:34:58] only thing you can lust after is her
[1:35:00] nose with this part right
[1:35:07] here you said man she got a nice looking
[1:35:10] Bree on
[1:35:13] her that's the only thing you you they
[1:35:16] got us beat they got us beating that
[1:35:18] bar Hallelujah you don't you can't see
[1:35:21] nothing even a hand come out she got a
[1:35:23] love over the
[1:35:28] thing but serving God is more than me
[1:35:32] amen it's a reality
[1:35:35] Hallelujah is Christ becoming visible in
[1:35:39] his children how many know that you're
[1:35:41] in a
[1:35:43] continuation how many not going to get
[1:35:44] settled down with just having a good
[1:35:47] service amen think about it I I want you
[1:35:50] I want you to I want you to maybe just
[1:35:52] think of something you heard
