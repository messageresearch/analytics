presence law take these songs that we've sung to lord just bless them lord may they be an anointing to you father may you be pleased and glad to dwell among us lord and speak to us we love you and thank you lord in jesus name we commit ourselves to you father amen thank you musicians you may be seated i've just asked sister naomi if she would come and sing as a special and it's just a a song that's blessed me and it goes with my thought this evening i believe it's the lord's thought and you know when you're worried your sermon's not going to be long enough it's always good to get someone to come and sing a song i'll just kidding god bless you um i was actually looking up the etymology i guess or the like the history of the song and just was really enjoying it because uh i didn't know it was this old it was like the 1850s when it was written it's a ham just a really old hymn and what i um i'll probably steal james's part of james's sermon but it's i didn't realize that it was a scriptural reference from malachi 3 verse 17 either so i thought that was really cool um i don't know how to use the keyboard though do i just unplug it do i just unplug it [Music] when he cometh when he comes to make up his jewels all his jewels precious to his bright crown a dawning they shall shine in their booty right gems of his crown [Music] he will gather he will gather the gems for his kingdom all the pure ones ones bright gems for his crown like the stars of the morning his bright ground a dawning they shall shine in their beauty bright gems [Music] little children little children who love their reading they are the jewels precious to his left and his own like the stars of the morning his bright crown a dawning they shall shine in their beauty bridge of his crown they shall shine in their beauty bright gems of his ground [Applause] amen that's what you are his jewels and this message has been on my heart for quite a while and it's just been brewing brother ben could i have the slideshow thinking i forgot it sorry and so this thoughts just brewed and i've just not really known where to take it because it's such a simple thought i thought you know like sometimes we expect we're just gonna come here and really dig real deep into the word and dig up some deep revelation but i just feel to go with what the lord showed me and i believe it's him that wants to speak to us tonight and i just say it's for me help me see you as jewels amen so if you stand while we read the word of god and we're just gonna read first john chapter four chapter four verse seven and all my scriptures are up there tonight so i can read it up there beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love and this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if god so loved us we ought to love one another and then we're just going to go to verse 20. if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god loveth his brother also amen and i just want to read that scripture naomi did speak that scripture but that's good malachi 3 verse 17 and it's up there and they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels i will spare them as a man spirit his own son that serveth them amen may the lord bless the reading of his word and you could take your seats so i just want to speak about how precious you are and not just how precious you are but how precious we see others because that's the burden of my heart that's what the lord's really changed in me over the last few years is how i see other people and i think that's so important for us because when i look at you and i see your flesh all i'm really seeing is something that's corrupt like it can't it just it's going to pass it's going to fade away as it's broken and but there's something behind that flesh that's precious and i want to be able to look through that flesh no matter what i see and before me i want to be able to look through that flesh amen because when the lord looks he doesn't see he doesn't see you as what you are now he sees you as what you will were before the world began amen and i know i'm really coming in on the back of brother amman's and brother ben's message recent messages when brother amman preached last wednesday i was like mate i i pretty much just gave him my notes is what i felt like but i thought you know me and amanda's so different i mean like he you know i thought there's no way i'm going to say it the same way he does so praise god you know we're in the channel but i want to find i want to get to a place where i can have divine love for you no matter what no matter what the problem problems that come up you know brother branham talks about having that divine love because that divine love when it's projected then sovereign grace steps in so when a situation comes up i just thought about this last night just to really dramatize it to sort of point this out just say tonight someone walked in they seen the sign they walked in off the street i'm like i want to go to service shekinah tabernacle when they walked in and it's a transgender right and it's a man wearing a dress and high heels i'm not saying this to be silly but because we see this just outside but they come to church because something's pulled them in they want to come in now what's the initial thoughts that come up you know how do how do we treat them at site well you know they say i want them i want to be a christian and come i mean i want to be a christian well you know i should probably take the dress off and you know put some pants on and maybe next time you come you know but that's our natural way to think of how to deal with a situation but what brother branham was saying with divine love when divine loves projecting god bless you it's so nice that you'd come to our service and what's your name tell me your story you know what you know what brought you to come here because once we can project divine love to them then sovereign grace comes in on the other side and situations start to be dealing with but if i just look at them and go i can't deal with this you know there's something with me then that needs to be dealt with amen and you know everyone that's here tonight is here because there's something that's pulled you here there's something even just naturally you know maybe you're different maybe you're more of an angel than me but i get home after work you know it's late and you rushed home and i really would rather just you know like stay on the couch like it's quite hard to like you know it actually takes encouragement to make myself come but there's something that's pulling me there's something that goes you know i want to be in church i want to come you know like there's something that's pulling even when i actually don't really want to come he looks i'm tired if you know what i mean but there's something that has to pull you amen there's got to be a longing and so if the person next to you has got the same longing that's pulling them amen is it the same longing that's pulling you you could be miles apart both in your spiritual walk naturally whatever they could be still living in sin but there's something pulling them it's the same force it's pulling you then how could we say one was greater than the other amen i like that song that brother isaac wrote i heard an eagles cry amen that's what i heard told me something about myself it told me i could come up higher yeah amen so you know i just that when i i used to be this way right have i seen something wrong i'd just take on that pharisee spirit straight away and i'd be that for transgender you know it was a really hard thing for me to overcome was seeing sin and not calling it sin god has to deal with me maybe he'll deal with someone else but you know it's just finding that divine love and then projecting it and letting god deal with the situation amen because we're just a sinner you know there's nothing that i can do in my own power to change that circumstance i can give advice but you know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink as the expression says you have to say lord it's your child i nee you need to you need to help them amen you know many people come to church not saying like here but a lot of people will go to church so they want to be a christian because they want to be righteous you know they want to live a righteous life but you know you don't come here to be righteous you come when you come in here you just come and say lord here i am and then the righteousness comes later you know that the lord does that but there's none that's righteous but one right our lord jesus but many people want to be righteous but and just doing that well i'm just going to be good and i can make myself as good as i want if i've really got strong will if i've really got a strong will there'll be people out there that call themselves christians that don't even know god but live more righteous than you because they're so strong-willed to overcome you know it's not about that we've got to meet god and someone else has to meet god too you know the dove the dove doesn't have to go and find a washing machine to get clean because it's already got an oil inside it it's just got to recognize the oils there it's already inside it so when that tran say that transgender walks in it's a seed of god it's a genuine seed child of god the thing that's going to make it clean is walked in the door with it it's there amen we just need to nurture it nurture it let it come up and that oil will start to push the sun out it was funny a couple couple weeks ago i think andy was saying you know we've got to get so slippery so much oil so follow the holy ghost that we're too slippery for the devil to get a hold of because that oil is already inside you know amen let it come out amen you know sometimes we can see differently like or sometimes we look we're not we're not the same we're all you know brother ben says we're not a god's not a cookie cutter all different and if i could just say with brother impo because you're just here but we look different you know like we're different we're not the same people and god's made us that way for his purpose and you know brother info if he was if someone said brother impo show us how to dance and he you know he'd probably do something a bit different than i would do you know but he's dancing and if you said to me uh brother james you know dance and i'm like that's how i dance but we're both rejoicing you know and now i can't go man that brother of god that he's so on fire for god you know he's dancing in the spirit and but you know what's to say that other person that's dancing in their own way it's not serving god you know that's funny we'll quite often think well the closer someone sits to the front the closer they are to god but you can get someone you know i've seen people that i know have a strong heated something between them and one will sit close you know and and pretend that everything's all right when it's not all right and then someone will sit in the back reserved and you'll be thinking oh you know they're one step from the door but they're sitting there more righteous than someone else so like if you can see what i'm trying to say it it's we're all different and we've all got things to overcome we've all we're all at different stages but we need to be able to say that's the seat of god that's the seat of god that's a sea to god we're all seeds of god we're just at different stages it takes it takes love for us to do that because it's hard you know like there's been so much hurt amongst christians you know you say well man it's so good and the christianity you know they don't have these bad things happen and but there's broken people there's broken families you know and it burdens my heart to see people that are broken and the message you know especially when it's family and and they're in a church and they're in a church but they they struggle to connect because something's happened and i tell you that if we're going to go on a rapture we're going to have to get connected you know there's actually something that's got to to fit amen we've got a gel heavenly father they're jewels to your crown they could not come they could not have come lest something warm them and you said no man can come except my father draws and all that the father has given me will come and here they come by something telling them to come here it is here then you've started a work amen if they've come the lord's drawn them they've come into the church he started a work amen we can just say amen right there he started a work and i pray tonight that you'll finish it amen not you the lord will finish it he started the work he'll finish the word amen lord by making them sons and daughters of god granted may not one of them be lost that should be our part in it someone's come in the lord started them the lord started them on the journey now my heart should be lord you finish it may not one of them be lost not man they're wrong you know like well whatever the issue is or you know that's my side that's my part lord they need this they need this lord let me pray oh lord i love that brother i love that sister amen lord finish it amen that's the divine a divine love you know sincere love you know it goes beyond a friendship okay this is my friend this is my best friend you know but it goes beyond friendship it steps beyond it steps into a reality where i can meet someone god bless you brother i've never met you before you're from the other side of the world i love you brother there's just something that just it just connects you know like brother branham was saying when he went beyond the curtain of time and and those sisters were there and and and that one of them come up and they gave him a hug and he said there was just there was just no feeling it's just this divine love you know it's just this connection it's like we're so close that's the love i want to feel you know amen hallelujah you know brother ben preached a sermon a few weeks ago and he talked about killing one's character and man i just like it it just really spoke to me i was just like you know it's so true and i just was you know saying amen oh me amen oh me but you know like because it's so true it's just and i was thinking about it because i've seen we've just been through something with work and um for the last i don't know year or year and a half we've had a few people that have all just been it's just been a bad team you know there's been some bad seeds in there and what you know that one person begins to stir this one and then that one stirs this one and then end up with three people sort of conspiring against the higher authority and and you know and then they'll go and stir the higher authority against this one here and a project manager against an owner or foreman and just starts this horrible circle of of just basically hate you know and and it's just this big downward spiral and this machine that's supposed to work and be well oiled and fit together and so i've just seen this happen and in the end to solve the problem we basically the even though we were the foreman the manager the owner and a few of the ones that had a bit more in the running of the business we got together even though we were struggling with each other and we said there's a problem and the problem is that these people here are stirring us against each other we need to get rid of the problem we got rid of all these guys that were conspiring and since then there's been no problem and i thought you know that that can be so true because you know when you talk about killing someone's influence because well maybe some people aren't easily influenced but i am quite easily influenced you know but so when we start you can have someone saying this brother's that and they've done this to me and hurt me there and done this and all of a sudden yeah yeah you know like and you start to enter into the burden of that and then now this brother hasn't even hurt me they'll you know be my best mate all the time and now it's like i start getting negative about them but they you know and it's just so easy for this to spiral and then you know and then i say something and we end up with a situation i had at work you know and so so i i just really entered into that burden i thought lord help me to see everyone as jewels amen help me to just see beyond this see beyond me you know let me see jesus you know when i look at brother ben i want to say you know what i don't see brother being i see jesus amen when i see brother impo i see jesus amen when i see sister hannah i see jesus that's that's what i want to see amen jesus said when he starts something he's going to finish it amen you know sometimes we just need to rub up against each other and and just talk or just share you know um i was listening to brother branham and he was talking about the story about uh jack coy jet coy have you ever heard that story he was a guide on the indian reservation and he got lost and he was out there with his horse and they were dying they were days from dying and they just needed to find water and he he started to sense there was water down the bottom of this cliff face or something and and he thought i just need to get down there and he found a game trail going down he said if i just follow this game trail it will take me down to the water and so he got us got on his horse it was tired and weak and and tried to get it to go and the horse wouldn't go down there and so he started beating the horse and the horse was bleeding and the horse didn't want to go the horse wanted to go this way and he was just pondering it and he thought you know my horse has led me thus far it's always been there for me just like the holy spirit has for us and he said now the horse is wanting me to lead me to go this way so i'm just going to trust my horse so he got on his horse and the horse let him down and they found the water and they got on the water and they were rejoicing we found the water we're saved praise god we're saved and he was washing his horse's wound that he had heard it and just rejoicing and suddenly they heard a voice say come out of the water and so they come out of the water and right there there was a bunch of of prospectors that had found a gold claim and they were drunk and they were sitting there and they said come up and have some venison with us and so jack coy got out of the water and went over to them and and had some venison with them and they asked him a bit about him and and the next thing they were saying jack if our venison is good enough to eat our whisky is good enough to drink have some whiskey and so i don't drink i said we all have our you'll drink our whiskey i'm sorry i don't drink and he said this old disfigured cowboy got out there with us 30 30. i said you'll drink this whiskey or i'll shoot you and he said i can't drink it and so cowboy sitting there drink my whiskey gun up to him i'll kill you and he said look i'm not afraid to die i i i'm saved amen i'm not afraid to die but before you shoot me let me tell you something and he said when i was a little boy 10 years old and my father had died my mother was dying back in kentucky i think it was and he said as a 10 year old boy my mother died in there she said jack your father died with a pack of cards in his hand she was a drunk she said promise me you'll never drink he said i promised my mum there that i never drink and i've never taken my first drink ever and telling this this cowboy there with a gun standing there and in the moment of silence this shot went off rang out through the canyon and someone else had been standing off to the side hearing this conversation take place we never know who's listening to our testimonies and there was another cowboy standing in the cracks of the rocks and he was waiting till these guys got too drunk and fell asleep was going to steal their gold and go and he said you know what jack so he he fired his shot smashed the glass that was in this other guy's hand stopped the moment saved jack and said i too once promised my mother that i'd never take my first drink but i broke my promise and he said when my shop echoed through the canyon tonight my mother in heaven heard me say a vow that i'll never take a drink again and he said both jack and the cowboy that put the shot through the glass said i'm going to serve god from now on and they went and they led those drunken cowboys the prospectors led them all to god they had a revival meeting because someone was willing to stand up and just just explain why i'm this way i can't take your drink this is why you know when someone comes in and they see things different than you you know well brother why don't you come and do this with us oh well actually i i don't feel led to do that i i can't my brother info said my feet won't lead me in there but now you begin to say you know this is why rather than going you're a sinner you shouldn't do that you know saying look this is why i can't do that the lord won't let me do it and this is my testimony and this is what happened and maybe that's how we need to be sometimes we just need to get close enough and and just enter into someone's burden and really rather than judge them just hear them amen and a little bit of time i thought i might just share a little bit of my testimony because a lot of you probably haven't heard a bit of that but you know the lord's formed and made me a way that i am because of you know he's got a trial for each of us and i didn't always love god you know i i was thinking about this today and i thought you know what i see myself in pool shoes because before i become a christian i hated christians i thought christians were dumb and i had a friend that was a black belt and he would go around and he would beat up christians street preachers he'd go around if he found anyone talking about christ he would absolutely annoy just beat them up and i thought this guy was my hero i thought he was really cool and i thought i was thinking about this today i thought i stood in pool shoes you know i didn't throw the stones but i was there and i thought man lord be merciful to me merciful to me that was the attitude that i was in so i was the sinner of sinners and then one day the lord showed me and said i'm god and and i i didn't know who he was i just just like that i was a drunk i was an alcoholic i was a an absolute drug addict and then four o'clock four am in the morning drunk and the worst state i could be in something just clicked something on tv showed me something and i said if there's a god i'm gonna serve him i don't know who he is but if there's a god i'm gonna serve him that's how quick god can change someone's life when you look at someone and you say there is no hope for that transgender there's no way there is a way there's a way make it amen and so it was interesting because god made a massive earthquake happen in christchurch for my sake because i was deep deep into it deepened with the gangs and i basically had no way out if you know gangs you don't just wake up one day and go hey guys you know i'm a christian now i'm not going to be a gang member anymore and lee that just doesn't happen but that night i think it was that morning it was either that morning or the next day that first big christchurch earthquake happened and i just i was out i was i said i need a job or i didn't say anyone because i had no one to talk to it was just me i basically left my family at that stage and it was just me and i looked on trade me i need a job a job available running them up do you have a job when can you start tomorrow good it was in culverton not far from where my wife was and so i went and took that job but i still wanted to find god because i didn't know who god was so i went down to the mosque the one where the big christchurch shooting was i walked in there there were 30 i i've spent my part in my testimony i just say there was about 30 pairs of shoes out the front of this mosque now if their shoes is people right like you don't just decorate your front porch with 30 pairs of shoes just to make it look like your church is full maybe some people do that i don't know anyway i didn't really know much about religion so i just walked in with my shoes on and i went in there hello anyone in there and walked in looked in the rooms couldn't find anyone i was weird so i went back out and went up to culverton to start my job i got up there and there was a irishman working in there and he was a pentecostal christian and he was he had just had a bad worker leave and he was praying that the right person would come along and so when i walked and i was rough i was rough back then and i walked in and he probably thought what have i got here lord i was praying for the right person to come along and i walked in and i don't even know i think i must have just said i want to find god and he's and he just started telling me about jesus i was right there i could have been a muslim you know i didn't know well god wasn't going to let me be that and he started to tell me about jesus and that and it all just started from there but the interesting thing was that after that earthquake two other young kiwi guys went down to that mosque the day after when i went in there they went in they become muslims i was a few years later i was reading an article on stuff news about this woman talking about her sons that went into the mosque after the earthquake become muslims ended up getting made extremists they went over to syria to fight and they were killed both of them were killed in an american airstrike in a syrian town and they had been converted and that was in that mosque the same day that i went in there and i just saw what the grace of god and if god can have that much grace on me how much grace can he have on someone that you've got against you know or someone that you can't see through the flesh amen and that's only that's only the you know the the gist of it there's so many fine details of how good god is to us amen hallelujah praise his name brother branham talking here believers though this who believes all this amen when he called his disciples he never went out and got the educated priest out of the seminaries he went down on the river and got fishermen peasants poor people that they would have nothing that the world could say why yes they become great men because they had a great background they had this they had no backgrounds at all he just picked them up like jewels out of the dirt and made their names immortal among men today peter james john and so forth fishermen of lowly peasant type people and i'm so glad that god still deals with poor people and common people amen someone that knows god walked into this building today and they were the most righteous looking person you've ever seen if they didn't know god you'd probably be worried you know but just god god takes the unexpected and finishes of work amen and nothing's too hard for him amen hello yeah but you know i was thinking about a prospector because we are prospectors that's what we're called to be we're we're called to be prospectors to go and find those that need saving and when a prospector prospector goes looking for a jewel he goes mining right and you never really you heard the old saying you find a diamond in the rough and you don't always find a diamond maybe where you'd expect to find it you've got to go into you know places you probably don't want to go to find the diamond and when a prospector finds a jewel you know he picks that jewel up or he carves it off a rock face and he picks it up and it's just a rock you know or it's just a big pile of mud and this guy's going praise god oh he's probably not saying that but he's going yeah i found a million dollars or whatever he's found and everyone else that doesn't know what a diamond how a diamonds found saying that bro that's just like a pile of mud you know it's just a rock because the diamonds in sight right finding the prospect has got to know what to look for right a prospect that goes into the field i don't know if you've ever seen anything about mining but you know they've got to look for a certain type of rock they go all the sapphire is going to be in this kind of rock here we've got to find this rock and then we take it back and we start to chisel the rock off and inside that kind of a rock there's going to be this gem and so when we go prospecting we're not going out to find the righteous you know this i mean i'd like to find righteous as well i'm not saying that righteousness is excluded but sometimes we're going to find a gem and it's not going to look like a gem right now but we've got to look through this crust that's on it and go you know what i think there's a gem in there rock it's the right kind of rock you know i've met this kind of rock before i mean got to go prospecting and sometimes that rock might stay around with him for a while you know he's happy and he's carrying this gem around with him the gems close by his side but it's still just dirty it's still covered in rock but it's just it's with him everywhere he goes you know and after a while he's like man i really should polish up that rock a bit and he gets it out and he starts giving it a bit of a rub and you know we're getting there you know maybe back in the days when they didn't have the tools that we had today to just make it happen straight away but just bit by bit and it starts polishing up and in the end there's just something that's just so valuable it's so valuable i mean what's more precious than a soul amen you know i was looking at um at where precious gems are found in the world i thought wouldn't it be so convenient if the naronga gorge you know the quarry there was just like a diamond mine right there you know central wellington there'd just be high rise buildings and the hat motorway would be six lanes wide and i thought you know but i wonder where jewels are found in the world you know because it just doesn't you know it's hard to find a precious soul it's hard it's they're not just there you know and so i was looking at this uh colombia is the biggest producer of emeralds 70 to 90 percent of the world's emeralds come from colombia africa is the most prominent producer of madagascar diamonds the biggest producer of sapphires sri lanka has more than 50 varieties of gems and they call it the treasure box of the indian ocean myanmar is the biggest producer of rubies producing up to 90 percent of the world's rubies and i thought you know it's just the way it is we've got to go into the rough sometimes to find a precious jewel and we've just got to see through the my you know we've just got to see beyond our own thinking sometimes let's see beyond our faults amen i think back to when i first received the baptism of the holy spirit and i believe i save you know and i think back to that time and there would be things that i did then that i'd be ashamed of now you know i would have was so happy it was probably one of the happiest time in my life i'd received this gospel and i'd be at work and i'd be happy and people will be like what are you doing this weekend and i'll be like i'm fasting i'm going to preach on sunday and i was happy and then a bit later on on the day we'd be talking and you know because all the other guys around you are still rough and be talking and i was loving god and then all of a sudden i'd say something like a word would come out and i'd be like where did that even come from you know i didn't expect that to come that just i was so fresh and but i love god so much and i go you go well brother i feel you're saved but you know it just it takes time but i don't look back and go man i wasn't even saved then you know like and and that's what we have to see in each other when you go man that fella well that sister you know she's quite got it you know but how were we to say that who were you you know who was gracious to you someone saw you and saw value in you god saw value in you amen what if someone are thinking about this because this is reality what if someone said you know what i've got a description here of what a precious jewel is so i didn't see you as a jewel and they said look sister i'm sorry but you don't fit the description of a jewel a jewel is supposed to be clear shining bright and beautiful cut to perfection thus saith the description of a jewel you see what i'm saying and it's just in reality we're a work in progress and up to the day that our bodies leave this earth we're a work in progress amen hallelujah james 2 verse 1 brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of persons for if they come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring and goodly apparel and they come and also a poor man and vile raymond and you have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my footstool are you not partial in yourselves and i become judge of evil thoughts see we're all we're all form different and we're all we've all got a different cut you know each diamond has a different cut fits in a different place because the lord's got a crown and it's got different jewels that fit in different places but we shouldn't prefer one to another you go you know brother andy's such a wonderful brother and then pillar of the church now you know he's the best brother in the church right you know and start to feel i'm just bringing in the center and down into something we can understand right and see that and go well this brother over here you know like you never really hear them say amen that much they kind of you know keep to themselves a bit over here and and you know not that friendly and so i don't really pay any respect to them you know like yeah they're they're a brother but you know that's having respect of persons you know is having a risk and we shouldn't do that we should you know i love that brother you know and i'm just going to enter into how they feel you know that that's to me that's what seeing the jewelers amen i want to see a jewel in everyone because so many have been wounded but you know the lord told us to be salty and salt save is a wound so if someone's wounded you know someone's sitting in service you know i just i just can't enter in tonight you know because i've got a wound and it's bleeding and it's sore and it hurts and i love god and i'm saved but i just can't rejoice tonight you know it doesn't make them any less saved it's just they need some healing in the wound and salt savers the wound and when we can just get beside someone and you know really just be their friend and just care for them even maybe even if we cause the wound you know let's just get close to them and and just savour the wound just love them amen it's so simple you know i said i'm not wanting to bring something new or fresh this is just i feel what the lord is saying to us it's what he's saying to me amen um i go to this matthew 18 15 parable of the unforgiving servant but a scripture reading then peter came to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven therefore as the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which take account of his servants and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents but for as much as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had in payment to be made the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him of the dead now how many of us is that that come to the lord you know and we were in debt to him you know we we're just saying you chose me you bore my sin on your shoulders you know and he forgave us he forgave us he forgave me of being in portuguese you know so put yourself there but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which owed him a hundred pence and laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto the lord unto their lord all that was done then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all the debt because thou desired us me should us not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as i had pity on thee and as lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all was due of him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespass you know when we really think about that scripture and go man how could we not how could we not just have such a divine love such a precious love if i could say to you right now if you just search your heart everyone you've you know in the message say everyone in the church here maybe the church is outside of here and just say lord just think about is there someone that i can say just that i don't love them right just think is there someone i can say i just you know i've got all against them in my heart it's something i just that's what we need to deal with and i would say if there's someone that you can think of that i just can't forgive or i just don't like them i would say pray for that person you know start digging start digging up deep you know it's getting harder to mine these days i have to dig deeper and deeper and deeper to find the jewels and that's the burden that's been been working with me you know i want to have such a divine love that there's nothing that's going to stumble me in my walk to have pure forgiveness and just and and not just to have forgiveness not just to be like you hurt me and i forgive you for hurting me not that kind of forgiveness god bless you brother i love you i pray for you i care for you i want to see you rejoice i want to see your family blessed that kind of love amen not just i forgive you for hurting me that's not love amen you know i believe this the the time is approaching so fast things are happening you know when you start seeing trouble in the middle east things are happening you know brother branham said watch watch what's happening there you want to know the signs of the times you watch that amen so it's time to get serious now amen i'm gonna finish soon i'm not gonna keep us too long i can find where i actually am am i i think i've missed the scripture i'll just read it hebrews 10 24 let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembly of ourselves as a manner of some is but exhorting one another so much more as you see the day approaching so you know provoking unto love provoking encouraging one another lifting another one another up rather than casting one another down encouraging another up so much the more as you see that day approaching amen and christ the mystery of god reveal now the new birth is christ as a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position that will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is now notice you say brother branham that ain't ace it's the truth did you notice paul never knew jesus physically paul never knew him the only way paul knew him was by a revelation by a vision is that right paul only knew jesus by the revelation just like peter did peter peter had seen him in the flesh but he didn't know him by the flesh because jesus said so flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you even my own life didn't reveal it to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed the thing to you that he is the word of god and upon this rock i'll build my church peter didn't know him by flesh man by flesh man man walked and handled him and everything paul had something greater than all the apostles did see they said well i've got more revelation than you paul because you know i walked with him i went fishing with him one day i heard him talk he sat in a boat with me and actually told me let's go over here and fish in this place and we'll get more fish and we did see we seen him do things but paul saw him after he was dead buried and rose again and expressed himself in the pillar of fire that led the children of israel knowing paul being a jew would have never called that lord unless he had seen the expression he was back the same yesterday and forever said paul in other words i'm the same god today that i was yesterday and i'm the same light the same pillar of fire that moses talked to in the burning fish in the burning bush no wonder he could separate law from grace over in the book of hebrews he met that same pillar of fire he said i am jesus whom they'll persecute and he is and here he is today in the same manner by the same pillar of fire expressing himself and vindicating himself the same revealing the mystery of god that's been hid since the foundation of the world see it but the only way you're saved is to know him by revelation if i can take i can take the presbyterian doctrine and tie you pentecostals till you won't know and i can take the baptist doctrine and show you pentecostals a million things you knew nothing of that's right but that's not it that's not his church that's not his church his church is himself revealed amen do you see it and expressed by the word itself that he is god see see that's what it is you are him expressed and if anything's going to call someone to their position it is saying him and you and that's what's going to do it because if he started the work he's going to finish it and he's got people that are expressing himself upon each other amen because he can see you as you are in glory amen and i just my burden is may we see each other that way may it be different you know when when someone comes to you and says this brother you know did this to me like well this brother did you know he did good to you or to someone else just just turn the situation around that's i don't you think about how you can treat people better and just see what it does in your life see what it does to your walk if you can't break through with someone just pray just say lord help me to love this person you know i i would rather say someone's doing something that would make them seem like they're not even in the message and you go man i don't even know if this guy's in the message you know and i would say have love for them until the lord reveals it otherwise give them the benefit of the doubt amen we had a little situation at work with a new guy that started and he just keeps calling in sick all the time and the boss said to me today he said do you believe his story do you think he's really sick and i said look we don't know him we don't really know what he's going through i i think all we can do is give him the benefit of the doubt of the stage until he's innocent until he's proven guilty because i mean we don't know he might have got he got sick the first week he started then he worked a week and now he's sick awake again i mean that could just be bad luck but it's just having that burden to say lord you know i don't understand them i don't know them maybe as well as someone else says i'm just going to pray for them you know i'm just going to give them the benefit of a doubt that's a believer that's your child and lord i pray for them and i just give my prayers to you for them make them your jewel amen amen i said i wasn't going to preach long and i'm going to ask the musicians to keep come up maybe it was long and so i've had a burden on my heart and it's been something that's been working for quite a while and it's prospecting it's this what i'm talking about jules and the last time we were down in the south island i was praying to the lord and i just i went up to a high place and i was looking out across the country and i was just praying and i was just saying lord i don't know what this pool is i don't know why i'm so burdened for this place and as it's gone i've just been working with this burden and praying and i just have felt that the lord's drawing us to go to back to the south island and not for my own will not for because i like the south island more you know we joke about it a bit but there's actually a genuine sincere pool in my heart like we were touring talking about before that there's an eagle cry there's something that's pulling because you know it's so nice to be here and all be together and have fellowship but there's actually work to be done for the lord because there's jewels to be found there's things the lord's got a purpose and he's got a will and so in praying about this lots of doors have opened up and have made a way for us to go back down south island and so we are going to be moving in about four weeks for a job opportunity that's come and i just pray that you will pray for me and that you'll pray for nadine and that you'll pray for the believers in the south island and that you'll pray for the lord to stir up work because he's stirring up gifts in the south island he's stirring up people that are wanting to host meetings he's stirring up gifts and i believe that there's people that are going to be found and i truly believe that the lord has brought us here to teach us love to teach us this message that i've just talked to you tonight about because i've had to come here and learn that i've actually had to come here and learn what genuine love is because that's what i found when i come here and when people have asked me how i found this church i've said i see it as a city of refuge because people come here broken and they leave different and that's the fruit of a ministry that's the fruit of brother ben's ministry that people can actually come into this place one way and they leave another way amen and if you come in here and don't leave better then you haven't caught it amen so i pray as we continue to journey on that we won't leave the family amen because we're so a part of this family here and so connected and i don't even have a direct direction that the lord saying you're going to go and do this or you're going to go and start this or you're going to go and do that i just have a pull i just have a feeling you know brother isaac sings read a song and maybe not one that a lot of people know but it's always spoken to me there's always been something about the song that i've liked and it says it's funny when you get that real funny feeling like someone leading you into a direction that doesn't make sense but faith tells you it will all work together and that's what i feel like it just feels like faith is saying that god's got a purpose amen so i just pray that you'll uphold us and whatever the lord works we've been trying to leave doors open so that if the lord wanted to shut them they could be shut and they just keep opening so we'll just keep walking and and we'll see what happens amen i just want to sing a song could i just grab the guitar i'll just i'll give it back to you it's a song that i think everyone will know but it wasn't in the song book so i put it in there let your word be born in the manger of my heart who knows that song amen d we'll start with the chorus and then go to verse one let's stand let your world be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house [Music] tiny simple
