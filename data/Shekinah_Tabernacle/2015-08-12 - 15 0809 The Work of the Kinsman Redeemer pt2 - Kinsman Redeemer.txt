TRANSCRIPT
========================================
man that's the man Christ Jesus it's not a multitude of you know people can't make a committee and say these people did some nice things in there for we can pray to them that is not how the Bible works there's one mediator between God and man and that is the man Christ Jesus and so he had to remain there as an intercessor as a mediator until they came a season now where he was going to wind up his plan of redemption and he was going to claim back the title deed to the earth which which Adam lost and we'll read about in revelations chapter 5 if you got it handy and then he would take that he would take that title deed and he would wind up with plan of redemption now we as I said in the beginning Satan knows that the you know everything Adam has lost has been given back to the church amen he knows all these things but then he says now this is not for you it is for you it's absolutely for you now revelations chapter 5 we begin to remember this is a symbolic book but what John sees now has to be lived out now I'm not going to read the whole chapter but what we have is we have a scene in Revelations forward John has looked it up into the lift it up into heaven he seized the throne he sees the cherubims and the four twenty elders and all these suits and then in Revelations 5 he says I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written written written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals so this members all symbolic but this now is the title deed of the UF that Adam lost and what has to happen now as someone has to be found worthy to redeem everything back that Adam had fallen promise so a man because a man fell now a man had to raise up and take what a man had lost and so now there was a challenge that came forth and in verse 2 and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and the loosest seals they're off so there's a challenge now who's worthy and John when he looked he saw he could see no man heaven no man and earth not under the earth was able to open the book neither to look their eyes and he says he wet much and he didn't wait because he wasn't worthy but he worked because in you of someone if a man could not stand up and if a man could not take that book then the whole of creation was still life because remember it's one thing to redeem something you pay the price for the object and then you go clean you go claimant and on Calvary he he paid it all but then it comes a season now where he claims everything and then he he yo and then Eden is restored upon the earth and everything that Adam fell from has been restored so there comes a seasoned out where he doesn't have to pay any more blood the Bloods been cheered the price has been paid you know when he said it's finished the price was paid is done yes FF but then he had to come to hasn't got a point now where the lamb steps for the man steps forth to redeem what Adam fell from and so that's why that's why John went but then but then in verse 5 says one of the angel said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals they're off and he says and I beheld so I'm just reading this does it out and I'll be held on the midst of the throne and of the for peace in the midst of the elders stood a lamb and had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth now there's all symbolic remember because our Lord Jesus he you know because the fullness of god he fondly dwells in him but when he was on earth and younger days was flesh he was he called himself son of man prophet and he was the sacrifice can any rose with his own blood is the high priest and then you know but the intended to be king then him has to be judged mmm is to you know all these attributes in him but in certain times and the scripture he's expressing different things it's like it's like you know you know you take my wife and her was to beam up when she was born now just first bought and her was to be a sister yes but there's no siblings and her is to be your wife but she's not married and her is to be a mother but she doesn't have any children she's only a book but so n has all these potentials but she can't express them at that time you see and then and then now she becomes she's born so she's always a daughter and then what happens as time goes along her parents had more children so now she has siblings just so she could express herself as a sister yo but then there comes a time now where where we got married and so before that she was expressing herself more as a daughter but then when she married me she becomes my wife and they now her being a daughter has expressed less because he's married to me she's not at home anymore you're you're following me but then who was a waste to be daughter even now she's still a daughter she's still a sister but she expresses how mainly as wife and mother amen yeah so it doesn't what she's doing now doesn't take away from what she is yeah that's why because these questions were the Lambs taking the book there's no more mercy and it's all over no it's not I don't you don't understand man because he's a waster lamb hey lloyds was the lamb us will be the last he always was the high priest ways will be the high priests he always was the offering a many ways was these things so just because people say oh boy he's taking the book it must be mercy no and it wasn't him to be the lamb at always what he was always in him to be you know mediator intercessor advocate comforter all these things are in him but certain stages he's expressing things more than other things he's not the king yo he's not the son of David sitting on the throne yet but in her mr. be king amen you're following me so it's in him but it's not fully expressed yet right yep yeah you know you understand it's just like someone growing up when they're young all those potentials are in them but as time goes long dinner begins to express itself and they're still the things they were in the beginning yeah that's why that's why you say well he's taken the book he has taken the book but they're still there's still blood there's still intercession we still have a mediator hey we need a sacrifice we need a mediator until the days of these atoms changing these bodies amen we sin every day but the Bible says if you confess your sins he's faithful just to forgive us maybe is that right so we needed in to see so we need a lamb and he's still our lamb Oh amen but when John saw because John only knew him as lamb yep but then but then because he said the Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he didn't know Jesus align a tribe of Judah and their way it wasn't he only knew him as lamb amen it's just like if you never knew me just say I was I know I had some profession and then you never knew I was very good at something and then one day so I didn't know you're good at that or you could do that what's that you never knew me that way amen that's all it's clear right yeah and then so so he I'm just going to read this from the breach bc now he has he's taken this book this plan of redemption I mean you know he's taken the book of redemption out of the right hand of him that SAT upon the throne and then when john told us he began to rejoice he's all that in heaven under heaven and the earth all these things heard him cry out you know blessings honor and glory and power be under him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever yeah glory now he says this in the breach and maybe if you want to go list that sermon he says now he said the Lion of the tribe of Judah why out of Judah Judah was a lawgiver yo Judah a lawgiver shall not go before or between its knees until Shiloh comes but he will come rujuta and a lion the symbol of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he's overcome and when he looked around to see where that lamb was he I mean so where that lion was he saw a lamb strange look for a line and see LM the elder called him a lion but when john looked he saw a lamb a lamb that have been slain from the foundation the world and lamb heaven being slammed what was it what was a lamb who was bloody wound to the lamb that had been slammed but it was alive again and he was bloody he says oh my how can you look at that folks remain a center a lamb stepped up the elders in a line has overcome the line of the tribe of judah and john looked to see see the line but there came a lamb shaking with blood on him wounds he had prevailed you could tell you could tell he'd been in battle had been slain but he was alive again John hadn't noticed this land before you know here he hadn't been mentioned before know where had he been mentioned John didn't see it all over the heavens as he was looking but here it came forth where notice where it came forth where did it come from it came from the Father's throne where he had been seated since he had been slain and raised again and he raised up and sit on the right hand of God ever living to make intercessions amen raised here today as an intercession with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of the people oh my that's the one on depending upon he's still covered with bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of sins john looked at that land and the lamb looked like he had been slammed and then he noticed he was wounded cut and bruised and bleeding a bloody lamb that's what took our place isn't it isn't it strange a simple lamb had to take our place and he saw the land he proceeded out John hadn't seen him because he had been way back into the eternities even making intercession and showing that those who had come to God under the offering of blood of bulls and goats and substitution she offer ease offerings he also caused them had who believed that pointed to him and the blood had not been shed yet so he was there to clear them he was there too you and I and I've got a hope he's there tonight for every sinner the lamb had been slammed how can Jehovah see anything but that bloody lamb standing there and the lamb proceeded out into the vision now as it had been slammed notice come from the Father's throne I think weirdly advice from to the vision he came from glory we'd been seated at the right hand of God he advanced forth to John out of glory Oh would it not be a glorious singer of our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accepting him he would advance all the way from glory tonight to make himself known to any on the lam advancing from glory for intercession all right to make claims now for his Redemption remember he had been back on his minute or 'i'll work back there but remember these seals are ready to be opens and the lamb came from the center of God advance forth he says wait till we get over to that space of half now that silent the sanctuary smoking there's no more intercession the sacrifice is left as a judgment seat there's no more blood on it no more for the blood cover the left for the blood covered lamb has walked away don't you wait till that time remember and the Old Testament as long as the blood was off the mercy seat it was judgment if as long as the blood was on that there was mercy but when the lamb walked away that did it where's he been maybe I'll just stop there he is the mercy seat it's not a geographical location he is the mercy seat but I'm said when he is hanging on Calvary the mercy seat was in plain view yes it's not a location yeah there's all symbolic you understand but it's not a location I mean he is the mercy seat amen and then how do you receive mercy you believe his word I mean you believe his word if you received mercy hallelujah what's he been he's been an intercessor no other person tell me where Mary could make a decisions welcome Mary off a walk at Frank's a st. Francis of Assisi or fro st. Celia rather or some other human being god never saw a thousand saints come out from the material he saw em lam that have been slain bloody I don't care how many Saints have been slain they were all do it but every one of them like the thief sit at the cross we've sinned we've done this but this man start nothing he was the only man that was worthy here he came from the inter sir intercessory box that's what's he coming for now watch him oh my John was weeping where's all that what's going to happen don't wake John see the older he comes the lyin he's the one prevailed and when he looked here come a lamb bloody that had been slammed anything that's killed us bloody you know as killed its Nick chopped open or something bloods all over it Here Come a lamb being slain and he came forth over my wat to make his claims on his Redemption allu you he says Oh mark that doesn't make you feel like sitting in the corner and sitting down and crime for a while it means he says now he's coming to claim what he died for you amen this is the season we are in hallelujah and then if you read it so maybe I'm know I'm just going to finish he says also now a revelation 6 and verse 1 season I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the voice of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see now the Bible you know you read in John chapter 12 and Jesus a father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying I both glorified it and will glorify it again the people there for that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spoke to who so some heard a voice and some heard a thunder so a thunder there is as the voice is not interpreted I mean so what's happening now is the lamb has taken the book and he begins to open the seals and there begins to speak it because the thunder out amen and then John was about to ride at Naaman your revelations 10 I'm just trying these things together but he and it and this is an inverse fall so revelations tenure of Christ mighty angel descending with this book that he took in five is now open ne-yo and he's opened it then it says now and when the seven thunders that are their voices i was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those six wishes seven thunders uttered and write them not and in there and then it comes in the angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who craved the heaven and the things that there are now and the earth and the things that there are now and the seen and the things that there are now that time should be no longer so that no longer means this shall be no more delay he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets see saying those thunders that were held back because John heard it but he's told don't write it don't release it he says they will not be released or not until the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen and then in those days he's saying now that this mighty angel which is Christ will descend emirates or some bulbs is just the Holy Ghost coming to the church amen and he's saying here that when he comes down in this way he says there shall be no more delay delay for what I'm going to wind up my plant I'm going to restore my bride to where she should be I'm going to get rid of Satan I'm gonna restore Eden there's going to be no there's been two thousand years well it looks like there's been a delay it hasn't been a delay you weren't there two thousand years ago you'll hear today your names are on the book Amen you had to be redeemed you had to come into the earth I'm answer now you're finally here but he says now I'm going to wind up my plan now and I'm going to release what it has been held back from the church amen so now he says when you open the first seal it says and it thundered what's happening now it's God speaking when the word is open it is God speaking it was a thunder back there but it's not a thunder to us because we know what it means become plain to us so it's not a thousand to you it's a voice yes event and you understand the voice now I'm just going to tie this all back together and maybe I need to kind of one this up they say my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow that's why i said in the beginning Satan knows that the book of redemptions being been given Satan knows it's been given because Christ didn't take it for himself he took it to give it to you because of people are people had to be restored back to where they should be amen but then Satan's is how do you know it's for you how do you know dominion over me over there as for you because he says it's not for you I say well how do you know it's for you so this is he'll come to say this is not for you because you fail you keep doing things wrong over and over again I just tell you this much as I 53 says he was wounded it says he was bruised for our walk iniquities he was bruised for our iniquities what's an equity to know something and not Dodd do it over and over again basically he was wounded he was bruised for our iniquities amen oh how can i how can I be a Christian he was Bruce for your Nick woodys go read I sofa theory that's the lamb a menu so I fail every day he was bruised for our iniquities hey we ain't meant that doesn't mean we should just keep you know I'm not advocating sin one but amen but sometimes we hold such a high standard of what we think we should be and Satan takes Adam beats us down and beats us down and beat us down forget it he was wounded truth can we just realize I 53 let's just read this he said well this is elementary sometimes we forget the power of the lamp Isaiah 53 a man let's just go to let's go to verse one who has believed our report and to the end to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed the arm of the Lord has revealed to those who believe the report amen amen those who believe the report us because the arm of the Lord's been revealed to them yes I'm hello right here we are first believed our report to whom is the other Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender planning as a root out of the dry ground he has no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there shall be no there was no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and antiquated with grief and we had as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions and that's where we say Amen and he was bruised for our iniquities you know Satan with your very early my Christian walk Satan twisted into my mind that it's like this after you know that it's wrong and you do it there's no more blood for you he twisted around in my mind and my my heart just sank like a lead balloon I felt those lobsters lost would be me because it's how the devil works yes amen amen now I came to the conclusion i can't go back into the world because there's nothing in me to want it yes you bet and I told the Lord well before that the end if he can't Smith the hell I'll tell him that I love him anyway I get a chance to stand before him on that great day and tell him I love and even if it costs me the hell off that I worst room from there yeah amen amen this road man but the devil can twist it in your mind say you knew it was wrong but you you did it therefore there's no blood for you amen that's a light yes event he was wounded for our iniquities yes amen amen alleluia noobest I'm so you know we have a land mass or so we need to remember that the power of our lamb I'm condemned I feel I can't do it we have a lamb you have a lamb it went on your behalf you shall call us them Jesus you angels head for he shall save his people his people from their sins not everyone first people Charlie Charlie say Amen how do you know it's for you one day he spoke to me when that became more than religion when that became reality hallelujah and what's that now that's the Redeemer coming forth saying i will save you from your son i've done it now i'm going to enforce it upon you hallelujah amen you know so we have to say see us walk it's not for you I say the reason it's for you now that Satan's under your feet it's because you've heard the word and you believe it amen amen that's good don't stumble over simplicity faith faith is the most revealed face now don't undermine the fact that you believe don't let Satan undermine the fact that you're a believer believers can only believe they made out for a while but I always meet to believe I mean Peter was always meant to be a believer just go through the Bible I always meet to be believers yes amen Paul he was meant to be a believer amen and because they believed abraham believed God and it was a tribute to him for righteousness amen not because he has a good man anything like that but he believed and that faith that he had changed his whole life and he walked in harmony with the program of God they meant evil ovary yes he knew me hello I trust you to put yourself in the story God spoke to me I believe it my whole life has changed I follow the program of God Amen hallelujah amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God I'll pick up that some other time but you know faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God hearing is not faith but faith is hearing because you can hear it people could hear it doesn't mean they believe it but if you truly hear it it anchors down here that produces faith amen now for him up to you know I just I just I just finish on this he says no he says in John 10 he says I'm the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and a known of mine as the father North me even so no other father and I lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd so he attributed down these are mine because they hear my voice may follow me and they know me and I know them amen it's not that you know Hermits that he knows you amen when he was in the days of his flesh I just finish it when he was in the days of his flesh what was he doing he wasn't just healing a sick raising the dead what he was doing now is he kept the second Adam he is the second Adam and he came in flesh and all of his all his earthly ministry he was actually walking around Israel saying I'm the second Adam of them now I'm not looking for the second Eve where is she amen he was hunting his life yeah hallelujah John the Baptist was hunting his wife he says now them you know he actually identified I'm the friend of the bride group and he and he's the bridegroom you read about in the scripture so the whole purpose of the ministry was out here I am I'm the second Adam now I'm looking for the woman only I'm not going to restore the woman back maybe I'm now going to restore her to a rifle possession hurry and that's why when he leaks that by the way of Samaria he says I need to go by the way of Samaria to see the woman at the well it'll basically said is part of the second Eve there in sumeria I'm going to go find her I'm going to redeem her amen that's and that's why he whipped it well he was the deliverer from role but she was part of her amen and how was that showed she believed what he said amen hallelujah and never went back to her old life hallelujah amen that's why that's why he went by their way that's why he week plus Peter James and John because they were part of the second Eve allu you think about it that's why that's why God has sent his voice in the end time because the second Divas are part of the second Divas upon the earth amen and you have to hear the voice you have to become one with him so he sends his work and what was the purpose of the word is that you'd be united with him how lelu you you said and the devil says it's not for you I'd say too late he meant too late buddy you should have caught me years ago try to be couldn't get me trying to get me in religion tried to get me just chasing the dollar or something we couldn't do it ok I'll Lou you hey man it's just like the Eagle story so I was really blessed by this last fight you know you know the store i'm sure you're familiar with it mother Eagle Lake through X farmer came and took one put in the put it in the Hat tree there in the you know the chicken yard all these sinks and then this and then this you know this Eagle is hatching this chicken yard and tries to be like the chickens but then one day mom and you she laid two eggs no I'm sure you've heard this catalyst at times but the whole gospel is in the story the whole message is in the story because remember this message is a message of restoration to restore backup people to where they should be and there's and her mother eagles flying over the chicken yard because she knew she laid to thank God you you'd be here Amy glad you you'd be here and God will determine now to hunt you down and God found you and then so she look down as the head to the chicken yard and identified that looks like me down there and but this is a little eagle that's in a chicken yard who's never flawed trying to fly before because he's just imitated the other chickens have you ever seen a bird when it first starts to try and fly it's like a childhood when I start to begin to try and walk yes I don't get up and then they're busy sprinting down the hallway and you know a bird that's trying to learn to fly it doesn't just flap its wings and fly and saw up into the hem and lease its laps around it does all kinds of things but there's something in it you know when when the mother you're screamed out there was something in the baby eagle that said that's me you meant something because you know my sheep hear my voice and there was something in that little eagle that said that is me that somehow identify with with whip this bird in the air and she said now I just flap your wings come up with me and he said well I've never done that before Fletcher's wounds mommy gets up to the feds post it man he gets up to the top of the bottom the maybe bounces around them but then finally I mean the evil can fly up where its mother us man hallelujah now you can take that into the Christian and it is about the Christian life but what I'm trying to get it is there was something in the little eagle it was greater than what it perceived as failures had the ability to fly yes America I mean there's something in it that said I must go up there I mean I've been built to fly up there a menu I mean there was a resounding drive to get up into the heavens amen as the same thing with us hey we fall we flap around we do all kinds of things when we burst into the kingdom it doesn't matter that's irrelevant there you're the only relevant thing is that something in here is a deep call into the deep and something in you saying that's me i mean when i see this reveal this is me he's talking about me when he preaches a visible union Amy talks about me when he preaches kids when Redeemer I mean when he when he preaches the breach he's talking about me yes II Men hallelujah all these all these sermons all the way down he's talking about me when he's talking about adoption we're talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost all these things he's preaching about me baby alleluia amen it's something and you says that's me he's talking about I wasn't caused you to do raise up hey man but most of all see Satan says it's not for you so it's too late yes you may be for the foundation of the world God not man not you God put something in you then when God spoke his voice in this end time you'd say that's me yes Lord I can identify with that halloo you amen hallelujah maybe I just leave it there but that's why we could just rejoice so yo the devil says it's not for you and everything is restored Satan's under the believers feet it's not for you it is for you because my sheep hear my voice I mean there's something in the sheet that can respond to the Shepherd me that is all that matters maybe it took me probably far too long to say it but that's all that matters there's something in you see us yes beyond this thing you're on what you feel but something in your soul that says yes yeah I was built to be a son or daughter of God I will deign to be this way amen amen amen they don't forget it don't forget this service I mean if you're wrestling with something just takes eight and make a bet he doesn't understand it because he doesn't have it right he doesn't understand what I did the deed cooling to the thief it said what are you talking about the deep calling to think I don't have a deep Satan you got no deep I've got deep hey hallelujah I've got the right kind of deep Alleluia we need queer steam use itions coming amen amen hey we're built the pride is built to walk with Him in this alley brian is built to be fully restored and it has very image yes you man we can't be anything else Satan says is not for you he's a liar yes amen you cannot obtain to it it's already been given to you yes amen you know Moses was told what they what's in your hand he going to deliver Israel to Moses saying how am I going to do it what's in your hand yes he already had the judgment rod he had the rod that were part the Red Sea he had the rod that would crush Egypt smite Egypt he had the rod that had the power of creation he had those things here he walked with it 40 years maybe I know he had to stick that long but he he had a long time there was a ship and stick what have you got in your hand do you mean what if I got in my hand is just my stick God saw a judgment rod God saw a rod of deliverance and God had to open his eyes saying what do you really have you don't know what you had I'm going to tell you what you hit amen sometimes we forget we forget what we carry everybody what we've born with amen it's not what's in your hand what's in you what are you made of well unless this is my parents I go to church I believe in Jesus though go beyond that I believe the message go beyond that amen the very purpose the message came is to call you out even amen why did I call you out to become the bright as an eleazar call yesterday you know hey when a man hunts for a wife subconsciously he is looking for what's in his heart amen he's looking for to this heart so now when when Christ hunted you down when Christ found you he was looking for what was in his heart amen I mean he's looking for part of himself baby that's the same reason the days of his flesh he's a second Adam I'm looking for the second Heat I'm looking for that part of me amen hallelujah I'll do it and the devil says us not for you I'm sorry my sheep hear my voice and why do I hear the voice because i am that part that is looking for mmm and that's all that matters that's all that matters amen amen let's stand let's are just going I would still receive the laptop summaries in the display drivers not far enough a member what oh dear can you plug it into this top anyway you know you fix that you know this message yeah please yeah I trust I just if I have to repeat myself I reveal myself we have built mo he's looking for the woman as part of her and whatever a man marries is actually reflecting his real character his real nature amen to wind easily down the woman in the world he was finding a part of himself that was reflecting his very nature that's right talk about she has won five husbands and the one you with you to all that stuff that's not the real her but then Satan Satan could use that against it but then she could just say I'm sorry my sheep hear my voice I'm as cheatin you're not his sheep amen and being his sheep is all that matters because if you're one of us sheep you you know you're going I mean you take off into the great big sheet fold in the sky going to put it that way you're not going to be lost this event you can't be lost allu you hear me destroyed a mint because he's looking for part of them so I'm just a sinner saved by grace yes n no we are sinners saved by grace but God doesn't leave us in that way because he saw really what's on the inside of you that's why we can look at the devil and say get out going to hate men hey we're not a beaten-down people I'm sick praise the Lord I'm doing well praise a look I'm doing really well financially praise the Lord I have nothing crazy law hey whole just praise the Lord how do i be beaten
