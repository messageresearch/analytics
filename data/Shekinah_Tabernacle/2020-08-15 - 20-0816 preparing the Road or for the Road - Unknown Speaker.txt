[Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] praise the lord god bless you everyone welcome to church this morning amen who's happy to be here we have such a great opportunity that lays before us probably the best opportunity outside of accepting christ the best opportunity that we've had today is right now you know because every day with the lord gets better every every every every decision we make for him is always the the better one of all of the decisions we've ever made so this is actually the greatest opportunity that we've ever had that lays before us right now to enter into the holiest of holies and to to worship the lord and to to make another stand amen there was a lady [Music] that was um i think she was blind and deaf but she always used to go to church and people would sort of make fun of her for going to church you know they say what do you go why do you always go to church you can't see anything you can't hear anything it's almost pointless that you go along but she said you know i go to church because i like to let the devil know what side i'm on but we're thankful that we can we can see and we can hear and we can perceive so we have got such a great opportunity for us this morning to to worship god um just before we start brother ed is has got to come up and do something inform us of the new world order plans [Music] there we go yes yes so unfortunately we do uh have a government with with rules and they've changed it up a bit so we've got a few different levels and different regions um at this point we are in level two that for us require just to sign on so if you haven't sign on please there's a little uh qr code here at the the entrance if you can sign in we thought it would be a good opportunity just to tell you again about the exit so the x's is where you came in this morning there's another one uh basically behind sister belinda so as you go out into the foyer on the right there's a exit and please use that in the case of emergency there is hand sanitizers at the back and at the front where you come in at church there is face masks if you choose to want to wear one we also want to um so with the sanctuary we want to keep it reverent as well and everyone that's here is is sort of in a in an atmosphere of worship and we really want to keep that so we have the foyer we are not privileged in like certain churches that have you know a massive separated building where you can go and fellowship apologies for that but through the door there at brother key bends that is our foyer and through the hallway out on the um basically to sister jenny's house on the other side that's our our fellowship area so adults and then kids could you could you keep this as reverent as you possibly can so i me i will try and not stand in fellowship behind the sound desk i will i will try and be the the example but then when we when we gather and want to go through the door please if you decide whether you want to go through the door and to the back to sister genies or if the children want to go out to the to the outside on the at the entrance side um make that decision and then we can sort of keep the door closed as well um otherwise it's open and shut and open and sharp and we just lose a bit of that atmosphere in here i think that was it hey brother ben so thank you and um yeah thank you for your tolerance with all these levels and everything uh well let's try and abide by the rules aye god bless you amen praise the lord let's um let's stand this morning we'll just open up in prayer we live in very exciting times our our different freedoms may be eroding by the day but we're free in christ so who cares we're free in christ amen let's not saying that that was but you know we we know what's happening we know that the what's going to come upon the world but we don't have to fear we don't have to get worried we don't have to actually rearrange anything we're already on the right path we just keep doing what we're doing just keep worshiping the lord keep praising him you know even in paul's time there was a lot of political turmoil in paul's time a lot you know they were they were they were um countries being overthrown and political systems coming in and like jerusalem was being taken over and all those sorts of things but you read in the gospels you read nothing of it all he did was preach christ and him crucified and he just pressed on that way he wouldn't you think the world was in complete peace and nothing was going on because that's really what we're called to do and we're going to keep on doing it regardless of what happens amen let's just pray this morning lord jesus we thank you that we can be gathered here this morning lord and in this place lord where we can where we can be free in you lord jesus we just thank you lord that that amongst all the turmoil lord that we can we can come to you lord whether whether as paul said whether we're bond or whether we're free we're all free men in christ lord said we just thank you for that lord jesus we thank you for the exciting times that we're living in lord that we can that we know we're not we're not walking and blindly lord but we know what your prophet has spoken of we know what your word has spoken of lord and we see these negative things but we also know lord that it's a harvest time lord that that the seed that's in us lord is going to come to full maturity lord we are under great expectation for that to happen more and more in our lives lord jesus as we see the world go into darkness lord we thank you that that in our lives lord we can come into the complete light of your word and you lord jesus so we just we just thank you for that lord we thank you for the opportunity to press further into christ this morning that lays before us we pray that we would enter in lord and just lay aside anything that would hinder us from doing that bless brother ben as he ministers this morning lord and yeah may each heart just focus upon you this morning and make the most of this opportunity lord we've got we've set aside this building we've made all this effort lord but it's good but now we just want to let them the dynamics of the holy ghost come and take control of the service this morning lord so we we just commit the service to you lord forgive us of every sin lord anything that would that would separate us from you may you forgive us of that lord that we could come boldly before your throne of grace lord and that your spirit would could dwell with us peacefully this morning we just pray and just commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen amen praise the lord let some start with i'm going to

you musicians amen god bless you all happy birthday brother ahmad amen god bless you amen praise the lord um just just as you're getting your bibles um just a quick notice i'm sure you've probably noticed that the tracker code's been put up we were using the guesthub app but now we're using a government app so in the words of ashley bloomfield i encourage you to use it and there's face masks as well we have available if you'd like to have a face mask on while you're in service just um there's a box at the front and there so you're more than welcome to take those but um you know i was thinking what if what if the um covert 19 you know the 1 pm updates what if it was actually like an uh reporting of the outbreak of the holy ghost yeah and they said yesterday these many people received the holy ghost there's an outbreak in auckland there's an outbreak maybe there'd be an outbreak in wellington amen today hallelujah because we wouldn't be trying to avoid the place we were trying to get in lord where are you pouring yourself out i want to be right there hallelujah you know and how many have been hospitalized and so on you know how many have really got it you know amen so i pray there'll be a testimony report after this there was an outbreak of the holy ghost here in stokes valley amen hallelujah let's let's go to the scripture shall we um deuteronomy 2 um we still plan on having camp as well by the way we'll just see how um if the restrictions lift that everyone can come or whatever but we're still we're going to have camp lord willing so even if it just has to be us well it'll just be us but we'll see how we go so deuteronomy chapter 2 and um verse 36 um and then we're going to read uh we're going to go to joshua after this joshua chapter one so this is this is uh moses speaking here too to the children of israel from ariel which is by the brink of the river uh arnon and from the city that is by the river even unto gilead there was not one city too strong for us the lord our god delivered all unto us and i think that was on the board last sunday but i just got it from it we'll take every city we're going to take every place that's ours hallelujah and joshua 1 and from verse 2 down to verse 7. amen that's just what i got from that scripture he's saying this is what's happened but i'll say this is what's going to happen amen we're going to take every city every stronghold it's ours we're going to take it amen amen the words promised it we're going to receive it amen so we're in joshua one sorry is that is that slideshow going or is it just because of i don't really need it but um most of uh i went old school i printed stuff off today which is probably a good thing joshua 1 and and verses 2 to 7 moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even into the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hidites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i shall be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest uh observe to do uh according to all the law uh which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper where whether so ever thou goest i mean let's just bow he's in a word of prayer this morning if you want to be remembered and pray you want to raise your hand to the lord just say lord speak to me today lord jesus truly lord that's what i desire is that you would come come in our midst lord and minister lord to to all of our hearts lord jesus lord we're so so thankful you are a supernatural god lord and lord and in your presence the prophet has told us the supernatural is happening so lord may your presence lord just move from from from seat to seat lord heart to heart oh god may your holy ghost just fall on all of us oh lord may there be a great outbreak lord jesus father may there be a great outbreak oh god father of your spirit in this place oh god and father mate spread far and wide lord from sea to shining sea lord may you grant it for your glory lord we just want to commit our lives into your hands we thank you we can be gathered here this morning lord and have your word open and we're just lord believing and asking that you'll come the great author of the book lord may you come and open your word to our hearts our lord jesus may you make it plain may you make it live for your glory lord jesus and may we say lord after we've been here lord did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way lord may you make us more like you lord we pray for this sick world lord this lord this virus we know it's not just the one virus there's many viruses around lord i pray you touch those who are sick and body lord and not just those in body but lord father there's a sin sickness law that's gripped this world father lord may you liberate your children oh god whosoever will lord put a will in people's hearts to come to you lord and drink that water of life freely lord and receive eternal life lord may you grant it for your glory lord bear those who couldn't make it today lord may be their portion my lord father if they're able to stream in lord may they feel your presence in the room where they are lord may do all these things for your glory lord meet every need lord you see all the hands that have been raised in your presence so i ask lord may meet every need like only you can in your wonderful name and name the lord jesus christ we ask these things amen amen amen god bless your friends have your seats this morning and um i want to let's see if i have it here so now we read here in joshua well well our opening scripture was was you know there was not uh one city too strong for us the lord our god delivered uh all unto us and as i said i believe we're gonna take every city see every divine promise that is in the word we're gonna take it now we now we must no we understand that the book has come open in this day every part of the land is available every promise is here from from even just receiving christ to to a body change and everything in between i mean is ours in this day amen so so we we have the promise today that we will be made in his very image in his very likeness which is the word i mean not just a partial realization but a full realization i mean that that that what the prophets of old looked for we are now in the season of receiving that promise but we must understand and i'm sure we know that there are giants in the land there's demon powers in the land to try and stop us from receiving the promise so just because the book is open it doesn't mean now we just sit back and relax and what will be we must press in amen press into the spirit of god and say lord i want everything that is mine everything you died for i would receive it hallelujah so this is why we say we will take every city i mean and and and the weapon we have is enough they'll say it's more than enough i mean this this word of god is more than enough to take every stronghold to cast out every demon power i mean to conquer everything that can be conquered hallelujah and so we can can rest assure we will take every city hallelujah sure we may just be we you know we may have just crossed jordan we may have just taken a part of the word i mean for ourselves but there's more to take or maybe we've taken a far more portion than that amen has become real to us but there's more to take and we must never ever become complacent or just settle back and say well we have enough because the problem with this age is the condition of this age is art rich and increased with goods have need of nothing and to say you have need of nothing as you say you have enough i mean so so we can't ever have that attitude we have enough we need more we need more of him every day we need more of him right i mean and that should be the burden of our hearts lord i want more of you i thank you for what you have done amen i'm not i'm not questioning that i'm saved lord you revealed to me that i'm saved your blood was shed for me i've been made a new creature in you but i want more hallelujah so i trust when i'm speaking these things you won't i'm not trying to say you're going to meet the lord again no no we're going to press on the battle amen because remember god is looking for a bride that's without spot or wrinkle made in his image amen and we are here to grow into that image but we know it's him doing it right it's not us doing it it's not human favor that'll do it in its own self it's god's spirit and a people that will produce what he's wanting to produce hallelujah now to be now i like this here in joshua because many times we will look at the scripture and and and we'll think well that was just for joshua or that was just for the prophet but we know it's not just for him because when joshua comes to the end of his road and he's and he's preaching his last service to israel he gives the same commission that he received is now putting on them he says be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that's written in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not aside thereon from the right hand or to the left that sounds like what he what we read in chapter one right so the same commission that joshua received now the children have received that you come not among these nations that these remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them amen so so they received the same commission joshua received a commission from god and that same commission is passed down to every generation amen now we know the word strong it means to fasten upon to be constant to be established that's what means to be strong so it's not you know one way one way no just just be constant all my heart is yours lord everything i am belongs to you let every breath let all that i am never cease to worship you i mean so we should just make up our minds and i trust if you have keep pressing on if you haven't just make up your mind i'm going to serve you lord it doesn't matter what comes what goes i'm just gonna serve you hallelujah because we you know we must understand maybe i'll just you know i don't know what gear i'm in but hey i'll get somewhere and maybe i'll slow down who knows but you know we'll find a rest stop somewhere and we'll look at the view or something but you know we we must realize that we we are not gonna the bride will not be in some euphoric feeling and then a rapture will take place right you know you look at the resurrection in luke 24 were they in euphoria hey their sins are just being paid for but they weren't in a euphoria season they weren't rejoicing they weren't crying hosanna no they were broken their messiah had died this one died the ministry had locked themselves away the treasure of the church had committed suicide their world had fallen apart and they were living in the season of the resurrection so it's not it's not going to be some euphoria that comes over us and now i'm rapture ready hallelujah they weren't in their way they were the opposite but yet the lord walked with them and walked with them until they saw him and they realized that he was a fulfillment of the scripture and now the lord is here today and walking with us to make us realize that we are the fulfillment of the scripture i mean as you know the prophet said as jesus fulfilled the old testament the bride will fulfill the news hallelujah so that's why he's walking with us i mean that's why our hearts burn within us as he speaks to us why because he's wanting us to realize you are here to fulfill the new testament hallelujah they weren't rejoicing they were broken so it's not going to be euphoria oh i've got to feel happy therefore i've got the victory no they had the victory they they had overcome the beast system in their day had they bowed to the scribes and pharisees oh no right they were walking with the promised word and they died this is how they're feeling because they didn't understand what was going on so i just say that because don't expect to feel some euphoria and that's why i can be such a battle we have a camp and god just comes down and it comes down and it comes down some more that comes down again and it feels like it's just cloud9 why because the devil's just cast out of everywhere we're like in a bubble hollow isolation bubble of the holy ghost and everything's wonderful and then we think well and then then maybe you just gave your hearts a little neck kind of atmosphere because because we need that kind of atmosphere but then we go out and then you think this is how i'm just going to be all the time and then we find out no it's not the case and begin to question did it was that really real that happened to me it was real it was absolutely was god doing something right you've got to realize it's not how you feel it's what you believe hallelujah so you know jesus never ever said to anyone who who he prayed for or cast out the devil whatever do you feel it he didn't say only feel it he said i only believe right and the same thing with brother brown he says do you believe you didn't say do you feel it do you believe that's how i believe so it's irrespective of how we feel it's what we believe even in hebrews 11 when when the apostle paul would come down and speak of the heroes of faith he would say they were stoned they were sawn asunder now this is not in there i don't think they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about now wait this so so this is the modern day translation they wandered about everything was fine they rejoiced they were happy nothing went bad they had lots of money everything just went well uh hold on now they wandered about in sheepskins and goats skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered about in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth this is how they were and and and the law so it's not the apostle paul saying this comment this is god saying this world is not worthy of those people that's how great they are in my sight so it's not how we feel it's what we believe we'll have good days sure we'll have bad days sure we'll have the in-between days sure there'll be days when we don't feel nothing sure hallelujah but we must never ride on our feelings right on our faith hallelujah right on the revelation you have received amen so that's how it means to be that's why i say yo to be strong be constant amen be established now to be courageous now this word courageous has has many different uh definitions there in the hebrew this has to be but but i just grabbed a few to be steadfastly minded my mind doesn't change i've my mind's i've got my mind made up and i won't turn back because i'm going to see my jesus someday goodbye world i'll stay no longer with you goodbye pleasures of sin i'll stay no longer with you i've made up your mind i made up my mind to go god's way the rest of my life hallelujah that's what it means to be steadfastly minded or what's the crowd doing i don't know i'm going that way where's this word taking me what's going to take me in a rapture that sounds like a good deal hallelujah it means to prevail it means to be courageous hallelujah now we're living in an hour where there's to be a bride's revival now we know the bride's revival will not be a nationwide revival like the welsh revival or even even the great healing revival that went through i mean in the in the earlier part of the 20th or 21st century you know whichever one that is you know post world war ii healing revival are you all with me yep so it won't be like that but the bride's revival will be an individual revival i mean but of course we know as the bride gathers together it will be a collective revival in that sense i mean but we are but we every generation must have its own revival and this is this is what i want to tie in with with having you know increased with goods have need of nothing in other words we have enough amen we can't ever let that spirit get on us right we can't ever let a spirit come on as well i met the lord therefore my peer um my children is going to write in my on my coattails oh they say the right things they dress the right way they maybe point out all the wrong things that don't mean they're believers right they've got to meet god the same way you meet god exactly the same god i mean so every generation must have their own revival what does a revival produce the power of god to change your life i mean where the word is put on flesh in that individual and they see a god of power i mean not just a god of forgiveness a god of power i mean to overcome every devil that comes against him i mean that's a revival when you see a supernatural god come and live in you i mean that's a revival because you're awakened to realize i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god other that's why my father fights for me that's why he lives in my life i mean so every generation must have its own revival and i haven't even speak i'm not even young people necessarily only asking us it's been 50 odd years since the prophet was here this is a new crop i mean we're a new generation every generation must have its own revival it's wonderful what he did in our grandparents day but that's grandparent's day it's wonderful what he did in our parents day that's parents day what about today i mean what about today this is oh god break out in this place hallelujah may we just all get filled with the holy ghost like never before every generation our children we owe it to them for them to have a revival amen they deserve it they deserve god to live in their lives doesn't matter what age they are they deserve them to become a powerhouse of god amen now this isn't the message faith i don't know how i don't have the um no not that one um i don't have everything here there anyway um this is in the message faith so i don't have the year it was preached but it was preached when brother brown was a prophet amen as as brother danny said you know and and i think that stan's quoting you know people say was it before the seals was after seals during the seals it was when he was a prophet so anyway now so he says i'm the lord that heals all my diseases look to me all the ends of the earth and be healed amen he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed see god promised that jesus said the things that i do shall you do also i'll make myself known to every generation to the end of the world i'll be with you even in you i mean the same things that i do you do also more than this because the revival is all the way around the world right now i mean the fire is burning on every hill hallelujah amen but i i believe there's more more of a revival to have you see i'm having a glorious time the words incredible there's more to have there's more to have than what we currently have hallelujah i'm not saying we don't have anything but i'm saying there's more to have and there's far more than we can even fathom hallelujah so i think we should just take our restrictions of our mind away and say lord what do you want to do how do you want to live come and live that way whatever you want to do come and do it you live how you want to live you manifest your word of my life how you want to do it yes hallelujah that's hell have your way oh god amen brother brown would say in the spoken word is the original seed he says now you can see the church right there where it'll wind up it dies there it cannot bring forth of its kind why it's mixed uh you've you can't do nothing with it he's speaking about denomination coming forth it's dead it's finished is it there oh good it's finished all right that's why every generation has its own revival a chance at the word amen so now let's just stop there what does it mean to have a chance at the word here's the word he is a person he's more than an income paper he's more than a he's more than a prophet's voice on a tape he is the almighty god so every generation has its chance at the for the word at the word to live in them and every generation must have its own revival so the sovereign god at the judgment john wesley's group will raise up and the starch wash methodists of today will answer for it luther willa will will raise up the catholics will raise up and behind irenaeus martin polycarp and those that will have to stand the judgment for hybriding the word of god to dogmas this group of lutherans that followed luther's revival will answer the same thing the group of baptists that followed john smith's revival will do the same thing alexander campbell will do the same thing and the pentecostals will do the same thing that original revival when the holy ghost fell i'll say message people do the same thing too well brother and said but the message can't denominate but in some people's lives it will and it has we don't want to become a denomination in ourselves how do you do that i've got it all worked out a full stop behind it and this is how it is no no there's more of god there's more of god to have amen there's more of god to receive have the book has come open there's no plateau of our christian walk there is no plateau luther could plateau the joshua lived by faith it's like a ceiling he went into a ceiling and then the ceiling was lifted but higher wesley came i mean with sanctification that's as high as he could go azusa street pentecost the gifts were stored that's as they were higher than the lutheran that's as high as they could go but now the word itself has become manifested again the whole book has come open he himself is in the church like he was the day of pentecost there's no lid to that amen there's no lid we can't so what are you saying there's always more well how do you know you've got everything or you know everything that god has for you either one he takes you the dead in christ so so you'll die in christ or your body will be changed and you go to meet with them to meet the lord in the air that's how you know you've received it all for you hallelujah so until that time lord i want more of you i want to see you live more i want you lord may your word become more alive in my life amen hallelujah called out a people and god trying to get his word to it they organized set over there denominated died right there you say but look at what they're doing we'll get to that later on today they're coming right on down i'm just putting the seed in now now then we're going to show you after a while what happened now that's why each revival has its own each generation has its own revival god raises him up a man sets him with the word and starts him out for the message of that age now and as soon as that man's taken off the scene somebody else catches it hybrids it and it all falls back but what if what if someone i'll just i'll just turn this the other way what if god sends a man to the earth with his message right for the age and then as soon as that man is taken off the scene a people take that same word keep it in the same purity and run with it instead of a cycle of revival and death is just revival in the next generation revival next generation revival right that that are things that even maybe a founder looked at seeing coming now the next generation doesn't just see it coming sees it live hallelujah so and i believe i'm looking at a people they will not just take the word and hybrid by their own ideas but they'll keep it pure and i'll run with it hallelujah but each generation must have its own revival now can we now this is brother brown speaking from from our our church age now a lot of what i'm going to say from now on will be from the latest and church age in the church book you should go read the chapter it is very very powerful no actually let's just i'm just going to jump i'll come back now we have to let's go here as i said last sunday or last wednesday sunday i you know i i i raised the question are we preparing our children for the road or are we just preparing the road for the children now to prepare the children for the riders they can actually go become adults go into this world yet not be tied up with anything and walk with the lord right or we can prepare the road for the children that means we remove all obstacles that nothing in the world comes in their lives at all for as long as possible now to me now now this book streams one you just let the children do what you want the other one you basically move to siberia and you just have your homestead there and you don't see anyone ever right so there's two now one of them now both actually have no faith in them right now this this is a zorb has ever gone absorbing okay yep okay now when i thought of basically preparing the road for the children removing all obstacles i thought it's like absorbing you you basically wrap your child up in a zorb so nothing can get in and you push him down the hill of life and say i hope he gets to the bottom i believe he will because i've repeat the road nothing can get in nothing and get out now this one's this is actually a car in here it's got safety shield technology it's a car and a zorb now this is man's ability to protect something and it can be the same thing with i'm just going to give the two extremes okay now this is man's ability to protect their children we're to keep going to prepare the road may they have no trouble may they have no made no demon powers come near them we're going to keep them isolated because we love him and and we're just going to apply the token and but then what happens when the car gets out of the zorb it's going to go on the road it's never seen a road before maybe it's hurt sun roads are bad keep off the road son there's other cars out there they're scary it'll get hit by another car doesn't know how to maneuver defensive driving course you don't need one if you're absorbed to me that is human a human safety shield and our human even though it's good intentions good intentions without the holy ghost actually doing it is just human effort and you're making a denomination of your children but then but they're the same token if we don't if we just let them go out there without any kind of you know you know brother bram said be the buddy be there buddy yeah so they can talk to you and you can talk to them and it's not daddy today i see a fire in school and you just jump up and down and you know they can actually tell you what's going on here and you can actually come down to their level you know jesus jesus was the uh i don't like slides because i jump around but you know mary and joseph went to have winter a revival in jerusalem they left you they presumed that he was with him when they went home and many parents in a christian walk are having a glorious time and they forget their children they leave their children somewhere they're just presuming well they're just with us because they're in the same atmosphere and the other things are going on but they're not actually they're not actually bringing their children with them and what god is doing in their own lives but there's no fellowship in the word right to actually just sit down and talk to them and they presume well our kids are with us and they're not with them at all they can on the outwa i would be looking like with them but they're not right and then many times you know we should not talk at our children we should talk with them amen there's a big difference between talking at them or just preaching at them you've got to talk to them with them not at them okay now this this is an article from last year he jumped off the golden gate bridge this man did and survived now he's seeing his wish for a safety net to come true this is on cnn now i don't know if you can read this but this is the first word of the article jump that's the word kevin hinn's heard in his her head on september 25 year 2000 as he stood on the golden gate bridge in the midst of a struggle with mental illness hens got a running start and left over the rail i'm falling head first and immediately recognized that if i hit hit first i will die he said recently um hinz had deficient bipolar disorder and came to the bridge because he thought it would be the easiest way to die as soon as he cleared the railing however a new feeling came over him regret so what is this what is this who's saying jump now remember we have to prepare for a road if you don't know what's talking to you and motivating you and that devil actually succeeded in him getting to jump but as soon as he jumped while the devil said well my work is done and he leaves him right we have to prepare our children we're not exempt from this they're not exempt from this why do things like this happen because of issues because of pain because of hurt because of misunderstanding if you keep pouring into your children that no one likes them and they're misunderstood and whatever they'll they'll they'll just generate a complex no one likes me no one's my friend no one will play with me this one this one this one and what happens jump think about it now this is probably not where you thought this would go today but here we are that's why we have to talk with our children remember if you have the holy ghost in your life you have the key to i don't i pray no one's like this here but if you are there is someone standing present that can actually get that out of your head that you won't jump you say satan get out of my life you're a murderer from the beginning you're still a murderer today you can't take my life how do you try and make me jump thankfully this man survived i thought praise the lord and now he's got safety nets under the bridge so when people when when that same voice says jump there's a net to catch them there's a net more than a physical net there's a gospel net do you think our lord jesus likes anyone dying god is the author of life life is sacred to him brother baby said it's all written in a book it's life is sacred to god it doesn't matter whose life it is it's still sacred he's the author of it so we have to be able to i'm just going to leave that there but we have to prepare our children it's all down to relationship not beating down on them talking with them i mean because many times they start talking about stuff they don't know what's going on and first five seconds or maybe five minutes of the conversation you don't know what's going on say lord we need discernment amen that we can prepare them and this is older ones as well he was an adult he wasn't a little child but we have a key that can release people he said well no one understands what i'm going through jesus does the lord understands what's going on in your life and your parents want to understand what's going on in your life and we all want to understand if you you know you know parents try their best i'm i'm one so i'll stick up for them we try our best we're limited we are sure we are but we try our best amens we're trying so now what's that got to do with this age in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance how can there be trials well now it is strange but in this age of plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had what with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly now that was in in in capitals in the church book that's not me we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation where everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about we have really have nothing to be unhappy about can we eat yes can we have clothing yes can we have shelter yes can we live in a free country yes with really nothing to be unhappy about millions of taking sedatives at night pet pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering into institutions and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol and you can just replace it with alcohol by any kind of drug yet this age boasts of its tremendous stores so already here stores of worldly goods but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boasts of better moral values and it is more um and it is more corrupt than any age since the flood we think we have ethically we have arrived we have science we have knowledge we have psychiatry you know all those things so we so this we think we're better morals than ever but it's more corrupt than any other agents of flood it talks about its knowledge in science but it is fighting a losing battle on all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth in one generation we have gone all the way from the horse and buggy to the space age and we are proud and boastful about it now when i was little in the old days we had no internet youtube wasn't a thing instagram wasn't a thing digital cameras weren't a thing smartphones no they weren't a thing so even even even in our generation we've gone from a landline or maybe a brick phone to augmented reality it's a digital age hyper connectivity you know but yet people are more alone they feel more isolated they actually connect less on a meaningful level because of all those things i'm i'm connected with heaps of people i put a something on social media i get like 100 odd likes or love hearts or whatever but you're not actually connected with those people in a meaningful way what is it now boastful about it but inside is a dark void cavern that is crying out in torment and without a known reason men's hearts are failing for fear you know it's incredible to me when when someone and they are serious they likened the covert lockdown in this country as to being in world war ii and they were serious they put that on par world war ii with a covert lockdown men's hearts failing for fear they said we're struggling this is just as bad as what europe and the rest of the world when you know when those walls are fought no it ain't no it ain't it's not even there sitting in a house people complaining about being in in enforced quarantine when they come into the country and they have wi-fi and they have food and they've got they're in a nice hotel and you know but everyone's worried about their mental health why what's happened something's happened in this age something's happened this is the road that we have to tread all of us yes we're not exempt from this thing and without known reason means hearts are failing for fear and the world is so darkened in this age yet could well be called the age of neurotics it boasts but it cannot back it up it cries peace there's no peace it cries that it has a great um amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire there is no peace saith my god to the wicked now that's scripture there so sadly this man jumped off the bridge so people are less happy than they've ever been mental illness is is is upon the earth like it's never been before and this is the world we must prepare to live in and whether you like it or not you say i didn't sign up to live in this age well god signed you up well that's not fair no it is fair because god has equipped you amen with his own self i mean to overcome this age hallelujah he did not throw he didn't he didn't just see this is not i used to call it latin not they ever played rugby or touch but it's like you know someone kicks a defensive bomb in the 20 you know and the 22. inside your own 22 you kick a defensive bomb then someone's got to catch that and try and win the game god don't do that god didn't throw us a hospital pass you know by by by putting you in this age he didn't god's equipped us i mean to overcome in this age every demon power every trouble we have given we have been given the ability we have been enabled to do it i mean to overcome in this age hallelujah oh we're not happy about that okay that's fine well oh boy tough crowd oh boy oh boy anywho you know we now brother branham would speak about so let's not zorb our children let's not just throw them to the dogs let's be their buddies they need a guide brother ram says in leadership you know mother gets them first then the school team or dad then the school teaches in the minister but now who leads them and we know all those things overlap but there'll come a day where my girls are not girls anymore but they're fully grown woman and my boys are fully grown man and they want to you know have a career before they get married or whatever you know i can't keep them in a zorb i'm not trying to keep them in his orb does that mean we just throw them out there whatever comes comes no no you need you need wisdom you need real wisdom because the problem is is a child is born like all of us with a fallen nature so they want to get out of the zorb and get hit by the truck because sin is appealing i'm glad there's no hallelujah's there but you know we were all born that way we all had your sinners appealing that's why people fall into it it's not like it takes it against their will actually their will says i want this because the devil manipulates human emotion their bodies everything any any twisted against people right so you can't put them in a zorb even though it may look very good on the outside we need holy ghost safety shield technology now as i said jesus was left behind in jerusalem by his parents his parents thought they were with him he was with them he wasn't where are your parents where are your children parents and i say children where are your parents spiritually oh they got their own thing they got their hobbies well hold on what about you what about you you know all of us kids here i'll throw i'll yeah anyway all the kids here deserve the best parents they deserve the best mom and dad that that god can make they deserve it don't they ah our kids and i believe we have the best young people in the country i'm glad someone agrees with me there yes just brother ed is speaking for everyone on behalf i i actually believe that i believe we have the best we don't have a bunch of ragtag you know we we have great young people amen so we see they are supposing him to be in the company but they had gone to day's journey where's he gone left him behind now let's go to revelation chapter three i'm gonna maybe i'm sorry if this is like three sermons in one or something but this is just you know we start someplace we end up another place and then we go home you know so that's kind of where we are so we need to look into the age that we are in but many times we are just looking at the negative aspect of this age because we know that the lord did say he didn't say one good thing about this age you know there was good every age there was good and bad this last age is just bad revelations three now let's go from verse 14. and unto the age angel of the church of the later sians write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now we're just going to stay right there now here is now we know in every church age the lord reveals a part of his deity right and every age now on this this age he is declaring that he is the amen which is the final saying it means so be it here's the amen he is the faithful and the true witness and the beginning of the creation of god now in order to be the beginning of it now i just want to break down a bit of this now he says now as he's standing in his church in this last day brother bam says my this is speaking about the beginning of the creation of god the faithful and true witness the amen my isn't it the most wonderful description of the attributes of our lovely lord and savior jesus christ these words just make me want to shout they bring such a spirit of reality into my heart just reading them without even waiting for a thorough revelation of the spirit upon them thrills me i'm glad he's the amen the amen is the final say amen our lord gets the final say in this age not the devil none of us works remember god is not some distant god he is currently working and i'll read the quote but he is currently working in the lives of men he's active in your life whether you see him or not he is active working in the lives of men in this hour hallelujah hallelujah i mean jesus is giving us the description of himself in relation to the last age the days of grace are winding up he has looked from the first century right through to the 20th and told us all things concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last h to us he gives us one final look at his own glorious and supreme deity this is the capstone revelation of himself what is that capstone revelation of himself the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god now thus saith the amen jesus is the amen this is all from the church age book if you're wondering when brother brown was a prophet and it was william branagh's book not levail's book okay so jesus is the amen of god jesus is the so beard of god amen stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for a prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise that stands for the seal of god that's just that word amen he's the amen amen so he is he stands for prevailing promise what's the prevailing promise in this day there's a people going to escape they're going to go on a rapture they're going to escape the wrath that's going to come upon the earth that's a promise and it will prevail i mean it stands for approval who does he approve of his bride it stands for finality amen what's that finality there's a people not going to see death they're going to go on a body change hallelujah amen these things saith the faithful and true witness now i want to show you uh what i find in the thought of faithful you know we often talk about a great unchanging god whose word does not change and when we speak of him after that manner we often get a view of him that makes him seem very impersonal amen because he doesn't change it is as though god made the whole universe and all the laws that pertain to it then he stood back and became a great and personal god it is as though god made a way of salvation for lost mankind that way being the cross and then when the death of christ had atoned for our sins and his resurrection gave us an open door to him god just folded his arms and stood back it is this we are it it is as if we majored on believing in a great creator god who having created lost personal interest in his creation now i say this is how this is how too many people are apt to think and i fear that's many times how we think he was here in the prophet's life he did something here for me once but now i just don't see him no more he's just beyond all things and you know he's not interested in me he's interested in us he's interested in every single one of us i mean and that's just not a partial interest he's really interested hallelujah i'm glad he's interested in me and he's not interested in me to throw me away he's interested in me to keep me he saved me to keep me hallelujah he didn't save me to lose me he saved me to keep me amen but that is wrong thinking for god is governing in the affairs of men right now he is both creator and sustainer so there's nothing that's going to come upon the earth that's going to get one over god right amen he is right now governing in the affairs of men even in this little country on the back side of the pacific god is governing in the affairs of men hallelujah amen says in colossians 1 for by him we are we're all things created that are in heaven and that are on earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist amen he is a sovereign god by his own counsel he purposed the plan of salvation of his own elect that which he foreknew the son died upon the cross to establish the means of salvation and the holy spirit carefully executes the will of the father hallelujah that's why the holy ghost is upon the earth he's carefully executing the will of the father what is the will of the father i got names in my book i took a photo of them at their best before the foundation the world my family album and all that are in the family album are going to end up on the other side in eternity again and now my spirit has come upon the earth i mean to carefully execute my will that those ones that in the lamb's book of life will end up in eternity hallelujah and whosoever will let them come amen oh i'm so glad what sorry he is working all things at this moment according to the purpose of his own will he is right in the midst of it all he's in the midst of his church this great creator savior god is faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great shepherd of the sheep his his very existence is for his own can i read that statement just one more time his very existence is for his own that's why why why is there god for you his very existence is for you hallelujah you give him purpose of being god before there ever was anything says i need a purpose of being and then he thought of a bride he thought of a world he's going to put them on he thought of the devil that's going to be thrown in the lake of fire he thought of his adversary he thought of how he's going to conquer him hallelujah he thought he was going to make a people that will love him more than anything else and he thought now i'm going to express them upon the earth why because i want to know them i want to love them i want to walk with them i want to have a relationship with them hallelujah and now you give him purpose see we think you know that's the problem of this of this modern age we live in people think what's the point of living there's point the reason you're alive is because god has a purpose for you being here and you are the purpose of heaven his very existence is for his own hallelujah hallelujah i mean he loves him and cares for them his eyes ever upon them i'm glad his eyes upon me i mean when the word says that your lives are hid with christ and god it means exactly what it says oh i'm so glad that my life my god abides faithful he is true to himself he won't lie he is the he is true to the word he will back it up amen he is true to us he will lose none of us but raise us up in the last day i'm glad that i'm resting in his faithfulness that's why i put that in big fonted and red and underlined i just love that i am glad that i'm resting in his faithfulness and that's why brother brahm says with every promise of god you've got to ask him for it then go thanking him for it hallelujah that's why you got to say lord i'm thanking you for the salvation of my children i'm thanking you for health i'm thanking you for guiding me through this world i'm thanking you for peace i'm thanking you for joy i'm thanking you for making me in your image hallelujah i'm thanking you lord you're going to carry me through i'm thanking you lord that you're faithful you begin to water the promise of god lord i thank you your word is true you know what i love about the book of acts yeah i love it i love it in in acts chapter 2 where the apostle peter is standing there and he's preaching the first ever church service and he says if you repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises to you and to your children that's the first thing he says so to me now if i have received the promise of the holy ghost then lord i'm thanking you lord you'll fulfill the next part of that verse hallelujah he can't just fulfill part of it and leave another part you know god doesn't back down on his promise god doesn't back down on his word he doesn't he doesn't throw a promise out to the sons of adam and daughters of adam and then say maybe oh no it can't be fulfilled and take it back god can't take his word back he throws it out there says now i'm here to back it up hallelujah that's what god does he wasn't you know he never brought in when when he told abraham you're going to have the promised son he didn't say next minute i actually i didn't realize you're that old didn't mean that didn't mean that no he said i mean it i mean what i've told you and i'm going to fulfill it in your own body and sarah's part of you she's part of the promise too haley has the same thing with our children our family i believe amen we're part of the promise they're part of the promise hallelujah and god doesn't god doesn't panic you know in our human minds we would think if god's going to have a bribe without spot or wrinkle and she's going to not taste death and you know break the cycle of the ages we would put them in a kind of age where there's really no problems we think so yeah yeah make it easy make it real easy we know every age had a challenge but this age is the worst hallelujah but this is the grandest of ages this is where people won't just like the ephesians aim at the high calling in christ then relax and go on to death but there's a people upon the earth that aim at and become why because god annoys them in such a way you know the spirit of god will take you to your destination you know he will take you to your destination that's not you gonna take it's not our human effort and how much sweat and blood and tears we pour into it that's gonna do it it's not sure however it manifests in your life some of us are quiet some of us are loud that's fine god's not a cookie cutter he doesn't make us all the same way right so how it manifests will be different but the but the manifestation of it will be the same what does that mean you know we can people can shout and jump and say lord thank you for my children or they can say lord thank you for my children and if that's a real revelation in their hearts they get their children right hallelujah amen so you know you're the spirit of god yeah god doesn't back up on any challenge he doesn't back up on his word he cannot back up on his word he is his word right so when he said there'll be an h like this h and we're living in this age and he predestinated people to that age and we're producing to this age and those people will overcome all things hallelujah hallelujah we will he said it in his word i believe i'm part of this word the right part of the word hallelujah i mean so so if he said that we were going to be this way then we're going to be this way sure we'll have challenges we'll have more challenges at this age than than any age before why do you say that because there's 200 000 000 demons released upon this age but we know that we are not fighting this battle alone uh it's time we lift up our heads and know that our redemption birth night amen because we know when when when hell opened up amen revelations night opened up but then john said i saw another mighty angel come down where christ himself came down to the earth with an open book he said now i'm going to actually push down the powers of hell and darkness i'm going to gather my sea to myself god can't lie he can't back up on a promise he can't even compromise our promise he has no middle ground you know it's not a negotiation with him and the devil well devil if you give me this then you know you know devil i said this but you know i need some wriggle room so i can do this and can you do this no no no no no god says she'll be there the devil will be under her feet she will be the overcomer of the age he doesn't put a bubble around you he doesn't put you in his orb where the devil can't get in hell yeah but he actually puts you on the battlefield but we know we're not alone on this road our god's here too amen it's not us trying to get into a rapture it's him getting us into a rapture it's not us trying to save our children our own human ability only it's god sure we should we've got to create an atmosphere amen we're going to raise them train them up in the right way hallelujah but we need wisdom to do it we need his anointing to do it because sadly many children have been raised the right way on the outward but on the inward they are not converted they go into the world and they never come back why because they were raised unfortunately the wrong way but we have a promise we have a promise hallelujah we have a promise we all make mistakes amen on behalf of everyone in this church as an adult we all make mistakes just in case you suddenly said amen i'll just say amen for you out loud we're all human but that's why we need the grace of god and we needed to depend lord you saved me and now maybe i came totally out of the world i had a guidance i had nothing to find me you know nothing to help me humanly but you found me now you've put me now you've made me a steward of my family i'm not sure my children are not mine hey jesus you're you belong to jesus girls but you've been but you've been given to me because he loved me that much to give you to me and i'm here to look after you until you go home hallelujah because you belong to him you don't belong to me only you belong to him most so now if that's a responsibility which it is now i want to be a wise student because i can either break them or make them robots or i can raise them the right way hallelujah amen help us jesus god doesn't back up on his word he cannot and he will not and he refuses to one thing god cannot do is fail holly god cannot fail he won't fail in this age he cannot fail in the sage there is gonna be a people that will have a bridge revival there will be a people i mean where everything brothers spoke about it bride will be manifested upon the earth oh i just gotta wait till i get into heaven brother ben and i can really praise him and live from there no no you're gonna do it now i mean because what you are there it's because you're already that way here now how it manifests on the outside guys not a cookie cutter but on the inside hallelujah so don't try and match with someone else match with the word of god we can't all be the same and i'm glad we're not all the same life would be boring variety is the spice of life hallelujah so no but but what we are there is because we are here already hallelujah hello amen they will kill doesn't matter how big how fat how wide how impossible you know brother and paul said a couple of weeks ago he said when you let god be god when you let god be god i mean then he can step on the scene but when you stop him being god he can't be god in your life how do you try and be how do you stop him you try and do it yourself you try and control it you try and do it in your own human ability he he waits saying are you done yet are you finished because we get to a place say lord this is not working and and he he could have told you years ago i know i've been watching this whole thing this is just come on man come on tag me in here and when we let god be god oh i've got to sort this out let god sort it out let god sort it out let god take care of it yes hallelujah amen does that mean i sit back and do nothing no he'll lead you we need wisdom but you've got to let god be god god's bigger than our problems god's bigger than the pressure in the world god's bigger than the pressure economic pressure sickness pressure whatever pressure in the world god is bigger than ladies here god is far bigger than later we don't need to fear nothing he's bigger oh but i'm looking down the i'm looking down the barrel of a great big trial he's bigger than your trial he's bigger than the hardship he's bigger than the uncertainty just let god be god if god found you he found you to keep you right and if he found you he's going to take you all the way through just don't lose your confidence you know what brother brown would do i can't remember who i heard saying this but your brother brother brown would stand there and he would give testimonies of what had happened in the past he'd tell about the mexican baby maybe congressman upshaw maybe different ones have been supernaturally healed what was he doing he was now building an atmosphere lord you did that and now we're facing this but you're the same god there as here hallelujah and he began to let god be god god you did it there how did he do it i don't know i just believe his word amen so whatever he did for you in the past he will continue in the future if you surrender to him there and and he overcame your problem there surrender to him here he'll overcome your problem here hallelujah didn't he call us out didn't he find us wherever we were we we may have been raised in a church but one day he quickened us to his word or we came out of the world and one day he quickened us to his word hallelujah he brought us out he found us he turned our heart you know marvel the scripture says that there's not one that seeks after god and that's not i'm not and and sometimes maybe i just used to read that well that's just the people in the world no that's every single human being every everyone not one man seeks after god the apostle paul said and that's actually god saying you know no one seeks after me well then how on earth do people start seeking after him then when you let god be god he can turn a heart that's made up their mind i'm going this way hey the apostle paul made up his mind i'm gonna wipe this out i'm gonna stop these fanatics these holy rollers shouting bunch of tongue speaking crazy people i'm gonna deal with them i'm gonna shut this up these bunch of heretics he made up his mind he planned the whole thing that was a heart not seeking after god no religious but then god met him on the road to damascus because god knew that's my first church age messenger he let him be raised up in the at the feet of gamalia he let him become the pharisee of the pharisees god wasn't panicking god didn't put him in a zorb waiting for a time to be released upon the earth helena he let him be raised up in that way because he knew he had a time appointed and the apostle paul wasn't going on the road damascus saying i wonder if they are right i wonder i wonder if you know are we right i wonder if they're right and secretly you know reading the message of the hour you know on youtube on his phone as his honest horse what are you listening to the apostles you know no no he was like i'm going to kill these guys i'm going to stamp this thing out but yet god turned his heart if he can do it for the apostle paul he can do it for every single person hallelujah so don't be don't be so worried but they're going the wrong way well we're built to go the wrong way but there's something greater than our natural birth right there's something far greater than whatever traits that we receive from our parents and whatever traits we pass down to our children there's something far greater far far far far greater than that and that's god but when you let god be god and you create an atmosphere in your home and your children and we see actually it's from our hearts that we love him holy it's not something that we force them into a mold and say you better conform to this boy or girl otherwise you're in trouble no something for our heart just comes forth oh how i love jesus to me he is so wonderful he is so good he found me he brought me out i was lost and undone but one day my heart wasn't interested but one day there was a seed in there that he deposited before the foundation of the world and a light began to shine maybe just a little ray of sunlight but it began to shine down on me i realized lord yes there's more to life than what i know and he calls you out hallelujah and it's just like glory fills your soul you know we can have that kind of feeling he said oh but you're not going to have that feeling going all the way no but but you can have that kind of condition of your heart you know when he first met you your heart becomes like baby skin all soft and you know pliable and everything's good and you can keep your heart in that condition every day of your life remember we're not called to actually become all soft and pliable and god just does whatever and and then we become all calloused and hard and so i'm set in my ways i'm mature now hold on you can just be i think it's brother eugene braun said you know a rut it's just a grave with both ends kicked out to the end that's what a rut is i'm just i'm just i'm just stuck in my ways is it god's ways and what is it producing is it producing a meek loving spirit that power of god around you or some callous holder you know help us lord jesus because remember god doesn't put us in a zorb and say you know that's why that's why the devil said about job well you just put up an azorp god and you rolled him down the hill that's why he loves you and god said no no no when he gets out of that you can take him out of the zorb can we have that back up you just have this if i've gone too far you just have the safety shield hedge of protection around him that's why he loves you well no no no and god proved god proved to the devil and to job no no what you have is real and that's what he wants to do with us amen now hallelujah so god doesn't back up on his word he's the beginning of the creation of god we read now we know the beginning of the creation of god is not as as some would say is that he was a separate creation that god made and then with that he actually created all things but he's actually the the beginning of the creation of god is actually that word beginning means author of the creation of god by him all things were created amen but then he's also what he's talking about is actually a a separate creation from the finished physical original creation and what that creation is is actually a bride created into his image amen okay i'll just read it i hope you don't mind the reading the beginning of the creation of god that is who the lord jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that jesus was the first creation of god making him lower than godhead two lords amen then this first creation created all the rest of the universe whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the bible the words are he is the beginner or the author of the creation of god now we know for surely that jesus christ is god very god he is the creator amen john 1 3 all things are made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he is the one of whom it said in genesis 1 1 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth also it says in exodus 20 and 11 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and sea and all that's in them is and rested upon the seventh day see there is no doubt that he is the creator he was the creator of a finished physical creation surely we can see that these uh what these words mean now to have any other interpretation would mean that god created god how could god be created when he himself is the creator but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as the spirit of god he came down and created in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he simply i mean um i want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human ovum supply by mary there would be sinful mankind producing a body that would be that would not have produced the last adam of him it was said lo a body has thou the father prepared for me god not mary provided that body mary was a human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a god-man he was the son of god he was of the new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race colossians 1 and 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead and in all things that he might have preeminence second corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things have passed away behold all things have become new there you can see now that through man was of the old order or creation but now in union with christ he has become the new creation of god hallelujah ephesians 2 and 10 for we are his workmanship created in union with christ jesus unto good works i am in ephesians 4 and 24 and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over okay now now we're talking about us okay so this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it is it's a new creation it's another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by the ways of the flesh that was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of abraham's issue through the godly isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of man now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation i mean this is the true revelation of god this was his purpose i mean this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to this last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as the author of the new creation of god hallelujah amen his sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his um omniscience and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know what uh that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving glory from his brethren if he did not make it sure we aren't a patched up job we aren't a renovated people we are a new creature amen that's why i said i think last sunday speaking from that um interview that brother brahm had that he referred to in the message paradox where that it uh mum and dad were talking about their son though he was baptized though he had come to the altar done all the right things outwardly i mean he did something to his fiancee that that that really hurt her and then brother abraham talked about while the lineage of the father was german then and the and the mother i think was italian or or or no no irish or vice versa and those traits are now bred into the boy and he's saying actually he's still an old creation because the natural lineage of the parents though they didn't have those traits anymore because they were born again brother iran said you're not like that because you've met the lord right so so they were a new creation they weren't a patched up model they were new right so the family traits that they should have had were now gone because the old man was there the new man had come alive right but the sun was still the old creation help us lord jesus that now we actually are new creation we're not just a patched up group where you know you know that that that we don't just see our natural family lineage living but we're actually a new creation hallelujah amen now how we doing okay now so he says that he is the author of the creation of god he is the faithful and true witness hallelujah but then now he has a complaint against the uh church in revelations 3 um if if you want to throw i might have it on the slide somewhere but he says because thou art lukewarm he says i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot either that thou wert i would that thou would cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew the out of my mouth now to look at this we just want to look at now what is in the mouth of god we understand that the bible never says that that we're in his mouth we are in his bosom we're engraved on the palm of his hands but we are never ever in his mouth so what is in the mouth of the lord the word right out of his mouth came a sharp twitch's soul which is the word of god amen so now because this church gets into this condition now they're not further on fire for god they're not ice cold but they just have enough religion just to like say well i'm a christian and i go to church amen but because they're this way they actually nauseate god and he actually spews them out of his mouth and what that means is now they no longer speak for him they now speak for their own selves so it's more than just yeah so it's not just a kicking out of a people it's actually what is in his word is i mean what is in his mouth is his word right and because they're lukewarm they no longer are where his word um they are not speaking for him anymore and if we are on fire for god he doesn't spew us out to what we are his word amen see see this has become flesh this has become flesh this does not produce a lady i see in church right this produces a bright church i mean so now now if we are on fire for god right then we will be the word of god amen now as i said many times the sermon it's not necessarily how it's physically manifested right because people have jumped and screamed and jumped up and down had great meetings but nothing's been produced right so it's not a physical outward way but that doesn't take away from the genuine jumping shouting and rejoicing right i don't want to pull you know the gutter on the both side of the road that's a ditch i want to stay down the middle of the road so the holy ghost causes me to jump around the church hallelujah if he caused me to stand still like this hallelujah if he caused me to shout and scream and speak in tongues hallelujah if it doesn't cause me to do that hallelujah right god's not a cookie cutter i mean so now what's happened is this church now does not speak for god the lady i see in church does not speak for god because they've been spewed out of his mouth where his word was his word is your amen so now but there has to be a people that will come back to the word again that god will actually speak through to be the final voice to the final age remember if you don't want okay we'll just if you don't want a spirit how do you get rid of a spirit that says jump you've got to be the mouthpiece of god amen hallelujah you actually have to be in such a way that god will it won't be you speaking to that thing it'll be god speaking to that thing oh we need the minister to do it no no no what about mummy and daddy amen because remember we being a father and a mother that's a god-given office that's a god ordained office and brother i'm even said about adoption a housewife that's an adopted place in the body hallelujah it means it's a powerful thing i mean so in that office you have authority to cast out devils things come and trouble your children your authority to cast it out i mean father has has had has more so being the head of the house being the gatekeeper of the home amen so that's why we can't blame things when when when when things come into our family and cause trouble well who opened the gate and if something else came another way well who who dealt with it that god came down and cast the spirit out we can't blame the world for the reason if our children are a certain way i mean because we have a power to get rid of it amen amen hallelujah otherwise we're absorbing again and zorbing makes you sick go around around we don't want to get sick okay amen now this is from the pergamon age he says now now jesus knew there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word in the pergamon age now now we're going to come back to what we just read there um which was yet 200 years from the patmos vision he knew that that drift would cause them to go into the dark ages he knew that the the way man originally got away from god was by first leaving the word if you leave that word you've left god thus he is presenting himself to the church of pergamos and indeed to all churches of all ages i am the word if you want deity in your midst which is god himself in your midst then welcome and receive the word amen that's why you hear even just anointed singing you hear the message you read the bible you say amen amen was it god comes down to that praise god comes down into that agreement hallelujah amen that's why it's important to aim in the word from your heart amen from here it can just be a um but that's still an amen efforts from here hallelujah god bless you brother isaac keep powering through don't let no one kick you around amen well it's true because people can stand be standing in front of me going like this and screaming and saying amen but there's no pull amen so you know it's got to be from here anyway amen don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this is what i'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself i am the word remember that i wonder if we are now he says remember that i wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst you know that word is the lord of glory the great king of glory is the word now mitch are we sufficiently impressed with god himself being in our lives not just with us but in us are we has that impacted us enough i mean has there been an impact of the word i've been so impacted my life has changed forever it's not just a glancing blow but i've been impacted hallelujah you see like you know you're like the running the bulls or something you see some bull just run over someone i mean they got impacted hallelujah that's like god god just i just pray god just impacts us in such a way that we walk different we talk different we we we see different we hear different i mean why because god just got a hold of us hallelujah amen he can do it don't you believe it amen i wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or is there isn't any answer yet in first john 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he heareth what whatsoever we ask we know that we have petitions that we we have the petitions that we have desired of him how do we ask what is the will of god there's only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god lamentations 3 37 who is he that sayeth and it cometh to pass when the law commandeth it not there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so if i say if it's in the word you can have it amen amen you can have it if it's in the word you can have it it's mine hallelujah amen if it's in the word you can have it amen and we can't petition or ask him unless it's in his name amen there it is again jesus the word is the word i mean jesus the name is the word the will you can't separate god and the word they are one now then this word that he left behind on printed pages a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said that his word was life amen that's exactly what it is i am the and then here's the way on the way the truth and the life romans 8 9 be if we if any man have not the spirit of christ he's none of his there it is he is the spirit and he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why that is the same as deity speaking every mountain has to go satan cannot stand before that man if the church way back there in that third age had only held on to the revelation of the living word in their midst the power of god would not have faded as it did in those dark ages and right today when the church returns to the word and faith amen we can say without doubt that the glory of god and the wonderful acts of god will be in her midst again what if we return to the word of god and faith amen hallelujah amen so we so we need to recognize now this word that's in our midst is the lord of glory hallelujah now the word now now this is from the church book again and forgive me for the reading but this is just how we are because you know i've said some things today and you look at me then i read it then you say okay so you know so so that's why it's like brother and paul did a couple of wednesdays ago we're just going to read some quotes and go home okay so here we are so now it says in revelations 3. no it's true you should look at some of you like really oh yeah okay you know so anyway now revelations 3 15 16 i know that works thou art neither cold nor hot i would that they now were cold or hot so then because they were lukewarm neither cold nor hot i will spew the out of my mouth we are going to look carefully at this now this is from the churches book ladies and church church it says that this latest in church age group is lukewarm this lukewarmness demands a penalty from god the penalty is that they'll be spewed out of his mouth here is where we don't want to go astray as a lot of folks do they are very unwisely say that god can spew you out of his mouth and that proves that there is no such a thing as any truth of the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints i mean perseverance of the saints so what's that saying people say well if you get lukewarm god's going to reject you and spew you out but then that actually goes against god actually preserving his saints okay hey if we get lukewarm god will bring us back and hot again we at cold is going to bring it remember if he wants us the bride though we may walk off the track he'll bring us back right you know people coming for the love of god then then that formalistic spirit comes along and they become formalistic or maybe the legalistic spirit comes along they become legalistic for a season i mean but if they're gods and if they really have the holy ghost god will bring them out of it right so you know just because the devil hits you one doesn't mean you're not a believer but if you do have the holy ghost you'll get up and you'll overcome that thing amen hallelujah i mean george washington lost a lot of battles in the uh war of independence but then he won they won the war i mean the allies lost a lot of war battles of world war ii but they won the war right so it's not him that loses the battle it's him that wins the war or wins the battle him that wins the war right amen so now hallelujah now it is i want to correct your thinking right now this verse is not given to an individual it's given to the church he's talking to the church for furthermore if you will keep the word in mind you will recall that nowhere does it say that we are in the mouth of god we are engraved on his palms we are carried in this bosom way back in the unknown ages before time we're in his mind we are in his sheepfold and in his pastures but never in his mouth but what is in the mouth of the lord the word is in his mouth matthew 4 and 4 but i uh but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god the word is supposed to be in our mouths too now we know that the church is his body it is where uh it is here taking his place that will be in the mouth what will be in the mouth of the church the word right because we are christ's body upon the earth first peter 4 and 11 if any man speak let him speak of the oracles the word of god second peter 1 21 for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost i mean so what is wrong with these people the last day they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it and he says i want to prove this to you right now i'm gonna i'm gonna close okay i'm about to close okay the baptists have their creeds and dogmas based on the word and you can't check them they say the um apostolic days of miracles are over there's no baptism with the holy ghost subsequent to believing the methodists say based on the word that there's no water baptism sprinkling is not baptism and that sanctification is this baptism with the holy ghost the church of christ majors in regenerational baptism and in all too many cases they go down dry sinners and come up with ones yet they claim their doctrine is word based go right down the line and come to the pentecostals do they have the word give them the word test and see they'll sell out the word for a sensation just about every time if you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and other signs whether in the word or not or whether properly interpreted from the word the majority will fall for it but what has happened to the word the word has been put aside so god says i am going against you all i'll spew out of my mouth this is the end four out of seven church ages i have seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mine and you can bring that right down to the individual you know the biggest dangerous thing people say i feel led but it's got to be led by the word but that gives a lot of wriggle room well i feel led but as it's based on scripture amen but you see so so we can't esteem our own word above his amen his word remember he's the amen we can say a lot but then he just says the final bit right hallelujah amen so it will be at the end of the stage i'm going to spew out of my mouth it is all over i'm going to speak all right but yet yes i'm right here in the midst of the church the amen of god the faithful and true witness will reveal himself and will be by my prophet oh yes that is so hallelujah and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets there it is he is sending a vindicated prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2000 years he's sending someone who is so far from organization education the word of uh world of religion that is john the baptist and elijah of old he will hear only from god and will have thus saith the lord and speak for god he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in malachi 4 and 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last days and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works hallelujah do you see it now if we are the and and and then he says now he says god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until the last day there will be another people again in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age he says yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it's its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her now to say that we are standing in place we are god's mouthpiece upon the earth that doesn't mean now we're speaking our own mind well god said this but now this is where we are so so this is what the jew said no the only way that that the bride is the voice of god upon the earth or the mouth mouthpiece of god is that god's mind is in her that it's not her speaking her own thought amen but it's god speaking his word right that's why we must be very careful to say what the message says right to actually stick what the bible says not to go beyond it we have boundaries in the word remember ruth was in boaz's field stay in that field stay in the field of the son of man don't look over the fence stay right in that word hallelujah and it will produce what it's meant to produce hallelujah but you see now well what has this got to do with kids absorbing in roads and and things it's got everything to do with it because if you now if you have the mind of christ and it's not your human ability trying to raise remember we're not to fashion our children after our own image amen i could make a little benjamin right i could form them in my image i don't want that i don't want them to be little benjamin jones loins i want them to love the lord and become one with him and be little mrs jesus is on the earth that's what we want amen right but the only way i can do that say lord come and live give me wisdom my god amen fall on our family give us a revival may my children may the church may everyone see that i love you more than anything that i am sold out i don't care about nothing else this world is falling apart but we have a sure word of prophecy in this day amen that will take us through every trial take us through every storm take us through every trouble hallelujah so lord jesus help us the road is paved the cars are out there the obstacles are there it's worse than it's ever been in the whole history of man but yet in the great darkness there's one standing present that can turn on the light which is the lord jesus christ you say it's real dark around now there's one that's the light jesus is the light of the world and he is working in our midst in our lives he is active in our lives to guide us through hallelujah we must keep our confidence upon him you say well my child just got hit by a truck now they want to jump we have a key of promise we have a key of promise that will open every door hallelujah we can't keep them from it but we can't throw them into it but we can by the holy ghost and that's just not that age you go read through the book of kings kings get blessed and there's always a turning point in there in their kingship they either they either fall or they continue on with god so it's not just young ages middle age too it's older age there's always a challenge god prospers someone and now they either get too big for their boots then god has to deal with them or they'll continue on with god like king uzziah god blessed and blessed and blessed him he wasn't a young fellow he was an adult and then he thought well he's just blessed and everything he can do anything he wants and he tries to be a priest in the in the temple there was that challenge there could he stay actually just under the hand of god and stay in his place oh but i'm blessed i can do anything i want hold on that was contrary to the word he started walking in his own will but yet religious yet it looked all fine so i say lord and that was what that was how the road was lord prepare us for this life's journey harley well i've made many mistakes don't worry about your mistakes don't don't have any regret just put it under the blood don't look in the rearview mirror this is another day we're going to go into spring there's going to be another season don't worry about the winter don't worry about what's happened in the past don't worry about i wish i did things differently you can't change the past but you can change the future you can change how it affects your future in your present amen you so so just put it under the blood hey lord i'm sorry i'm wrong i did wrong i should not have done that i shouldn't have treated this person like this but lord i'm gonna try me one more time help me lord on this journey amen amen shall we just stand shall we just dedicate ourselves to the lord i trust that something would have been helped let's pray shall we dear lord jesus as as our heads are bowed our eyes are closed lord you see hands that have been raised to you lord i put both hands up lord dear god i just pray father lord i i felt like i was jumping all around lord today different things but lord i pray you just help us oh god to lord be surrendered under your hand lord that it wouldn't be our emotions leading us lord it wouldn't be our our human nature but lord it would be your spirit dear lord jesus father lord we just want to pray that you'll help us oh god and lord in this life's journey lord we lord we know we can't wrap our families up and lord or lord and like azorban lord forgive me for using such ridiculous um illustrations but lord we can't wrap ourselves in cotton wool and and and and keep the world out and lord but neither should we let it in completely but lord i pray you'd help us so god that lord is where lord may we walk his families lord as one unit lord jesus not as individuals lord in our house but lord walkers walk his families oh god may give us guidance lord jesus give us wisdom my lord father i want to thank you lord jesus lord that you're still working lord you are a working lord in this age oh god you're not some impersonal god who's just kind of sent a prophet to the age and stood up there in eternity and lord and lord held your hands to your bosom and just to see what's happening but lord you're still upon the earth lord jesus you're still working in the affairs of men oh god father so lord i pray lord we just recognize that lord you are working in our lives even we may not see your unseen hand but lord we're still guided by that unseen hand lord i pray father lord we're all failures lord your prophet says we are failures to begin with but so lord i pray you'd forgive us oh god of our failures lord may we lord jesus lord we know that lord if we could do it all again lord we'd do things a little bit differently sometimes in lord completely differently in different situations but lord we can't change those but lord we can change lord how they do affect us so lord i pray lord you lord all those things will just be under your blood lord god may we not um lord live in the past but may we just press on the mark of the high calling lord lay on the things which are ahead of us oh god and lord we want to thank you lord we will take every city we will take every every stronghold the devil's put put up and lord every obstacle lord i believe will take those things lord by your spirit so father i just want to lord commit ourselves into your hands lord i want to thank you lord that lord jesus your bride is your mouthpiece upon the earth lord because it's you speaking through her lord not not man lord not not woman speaking but it's you speaking o god so lord i pray lord jesus may we recognize lord the position we are in lord and may we may we not uh uh may we may we use it wisely lord jesus may we not uh abuse our position but lord lord in a domineering way over anyone but lord may we just walk in meekness and humility dear god i just want to commit our lives into your hands lord we thank you for this morning lord and in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you friends can we have the musicians please amy i want to sing leaning on the everlasting arms amen and
