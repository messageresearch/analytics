[23:08] and sharing what they've been learning
[23:11] in the word so this week I'll let you in
[23:13] on how it went
[23:14] so that or sorry this last month so I
[23:18] wanted to do a surprise for them and
[23:20] I'll go into a bit of detail so I didn't
[23:23] tell them what the Sunday lesson was for
[23:25] the month and I took them outside I just
[23:27] had a camera with me a camera bag and I
[23:30] told them to follow me we're gonna go
[23:32] outside and we went to the school
[23:34] grounds over there we you know our
[23:35] little line of Sunday school went over
[23:38] around in the school and I told them
[23:40] that I wasn't gonna tell them what it
[23:42] was about but they're gonna pick one
[23:44] thing that they saw out in the school
[23:46] grounds or just wherever the walking
[23:48] along whatever and for them to pick it
[23:50] and then I'll take a photo with them
[23:52] with it so they did that and that was
[23:56] our Sunday School lessons for that day
[23:58] so they had no idea what was going on
[24:00] the next Sunday school I had them sorry
[24:05] I get a bit nervous I yeah I don't like
[24:08] standing up front but they do so so then
[24:13] the next one I told them what our lesson
[24:16] was gonna be about and I started off
[24:17] with this verse admin told me not to
[24:21] shake the microphone but I don't know if
[24:23] that's okay
[24:26] so um brother branham speaking here in
[24:29] sirs we would see Jesus I'll just get
[24:31] the PowerPoint now the theme was seeing
[24:40] God and I got this from the ticket time
[24:43] series we would see Jesus so you can
[24:45] read along with me
[24:46] as I read you could probably read better
[24:48] than me and without shaking we owe him
[24:52] our lives we owe him all that we are all
[24:54] the good things there is come by him and
[24:56] there's nothing good but what come by
[24:58] him sir we would see Jesus it reminds me
[25:02] of a little story I've often referred to
[25:04] I lived by a side of the Ohio River and
[25:06] there was a little boy who went to a
[25:08] certain church in my city and he was an
[25:10] enthusiastic little boy and the little
[25:12] fellow had faith that he had heard so
[25:14] much about God and he did not go to our
[25:16] church he went to another church and he
[25:18] went to his mother one day and said mama
[25:21] he was about 10 years old I guess little
[25:24] fellow for his age and he said I want to
[25:26] ask you something
[25:27] she said jr. go ahead and ask he said if
[25:34] this God that you took out and the
[25:37] pastor speaks from the pulpit in the
[25:38] sunday-school teacher tells us about in
[25:41] Sunday school if he is such a great God
[25:43] why can't we see him that is a very
[25:47] sensible question
[25:48] she said Sonny I'm not able to answer
[25:51] that such a question ask your Sunday
[25:53] school teacher in the little fellow the
[25:55] following Sabbath asked his Sunday
[25:56] school teacher in the question the
[25:58] question she said I'm not able to answer
[26:00] you go and see the pastor and he went to
[26:03] the pastor and the pastor said my little
[26:05] lad I'm fond of your enthusiasm but I'd
[26:07] like to say this that no man can see God
[26:10] well it disappointed the little fellow
[26:14] he would really he would um how would I
[26:17] really understand if he made the earth
[26:19] and the heavens and all these great
[26:21] things and then I can't see him he used
[26:29] to go up on the river with an old
[26:30] fisherman that they fish in the make a
[26:33] commercial fishing and he went up to run
[26:35] the Nets up near than six mile island
[26:37] above Louisville and there come up a
[26:40] rain and on the back a road back they
[26:42] had to get into the bushes to keep from
[26:44] being washed into in with the rain in
[26:46] the storm after the storm was over the
[26:48] Sun came out and the old fisherman
[26:50] bailed out his boat put the little boy
[26:53] in the stern and pushed out from the
[26:54] bank and started down the river and as
[26:56] he was clipping the oars against the
[26:58] waves as only a boatman knows the
[27:00] rhythm the Sun was going down in the
[27:02] West and across the East which he was
[27:04] faced pulling his boat there come a
[27:08] rainbow and the little fellow sitting
[27:10] quietly for a while noticed the old
[27:12] fisherman breathing Oh see now I could
[27:15] start crying because I think about it so
[27:17] shaking and crying sorry guys
[27:19] and catching his breath and snubbing and
[27:21] after a bit he noticed great glistening
[27:23] white tears rolling down his gray beard
[27:26] and dropping on his bosom I don't know
[27:28] why I have to join the old man on the
[27:30] fishermen but anyways I am though the
[27:32] little fellow became emotionally mission
[27:34] sorry emotional and excited and he
[27:36] rushed from the from the stern of the
[27:39] boat and up to the middle and said fell
[27:41] down at his knees and said sir I want to
[27:43] ask you a question said my mother or my
[27:46] Sunday school teacher or neither my
[27:48] pastor can answer me he said I noticed
[27:50] you looking at the rainbow and as I
[27:51] understand from the scriptures that God
[27:53] gave it as a sign and if God is so great
[27:56] why can't we see him and the old man
[27:59] kindly upset because of the little lads
[28:01] enthusiasm put pulled his oars into his
[28:04] lap took the little boy in his arms and
[28:05] looked at him in the face and brushed
[28:07] back his hair and gazed him in the eyes
[28:09] and he said Sonny all I've seen for the
[28:14] past forty years has been God okay yep
[28:19] there was so much in the old fisherman
[28:22] the only way to see God is get him on
[28:24] the inside of you so he can use your
[28:27] eyes you'll see him but if you're not
[28:30] but if you're trying to see him on an
[28:31] intellect conception of his word or some
[28:35] emotional workup it will never count
[28:37] anything he's got to be in you so and
[28:41] then I shared with these guys um when I
[28:44] first got saved well when he first I met
[28:47] the Lord when I was 21 and when when I
[28:52] met him whew when you meet Christ it's
[28:56] real so after I met him you know you're
[28:58] walking on cloud nine and the Sun is
[29:01] brighter they you know nothing nothing
[29:03] hinders you you just you know you're
[29:05] walking in a jumping and so after I met
[29:09] him this is what I saw everywhere I
[29:13] crosses everywhere but this time it
[29:22] meant something to me
[29:24] so with these guys I told them you can
[29:28] see God everywhere he created all the
[29:31] earth the klore and declare his glory
[29:33] you can see if you're looking and you
[29:36] can see you can see everything and

[47:29] the visitors god bless you amen let's I
[47:32] go to Isaiah and 6 verse 1 familiar
[47:47] piece of scripture to us all let's just
[47:49] go to eyes there six and one sees in the
[47:54] year that King Uzziah died I also saw
[47:57] the Lord sitting on a throne high and
[47:59] lifted up and his train filled the
[48:01] temple above it stood the Seraphim each
[48:04] one had six wings with twain he covered
[48:07] his face with twain he covered his feet
[48:09] with twain he did fly and one cried unto
[48:12] another and said holy holy holy is the
[48:15] Lord God of hosts the whole earth is
[48:17] full of his glory and the post of the
[48:19] door moved at the voice of him that
[48:21] cried and the house was filled with
[48:23] smoke then said I was me for I am undone
[48:26] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[48:29] dwell in the midst of a people with
[48:31] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[48:33] king the Lord of hosts then one of the
[48:37] Seraphim then flew one of the seraphim's
[48:39] unto me having a live coal in his hand
[48:41] which he had taken with the tongs from
[48:43] off the altar and he laid it upon my
[48:46] mouth and said lo this has touched thy
[48:48] lips and mine iniquity is taken away in
[48:50] thy sin is purged
[48:52] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[48:54] saying whom shall I send and who will go
[48:56] for us then said I here am I send me
[49:01] amen this bow is for a word of Prayer

[49:21] leave human control Lord
[49:23] reading reading scriptures such as this
[49:25] Lord we I feel very insufficient Lord to
[49:28] trim' minister your word so I asked
[49:30] I just want to get myself out of the way
[49:32] Lord may you step in and speak to your
[49:34] bride
[49:34] Lord or may you have preeminence in
[49:36] every life Lord may you not just anoint

[49:41] that your word would be anchored in our
[49:42] souls Lord please may you grant it
[49:44] father may you receive all honor glory
[49:46] and praise Lord because of this day in
[49:49] Jesus Christ then we ask amen
[49:51] I mean god bless you friends you may
[49:53] have your seats this morning and I want
[49:55] to I want to speak about being in his
[49:58] presence now let's just go back there to
[50:02] to Isaiah here in the temple you know it
[50:06] must have been an incredible moment
[50:08] there you know let's just go back and
[50:10] this follow eyes air into the temple you
[50:12] know no doubt he had been in that temple
[50:14] many times he knew everything was he
[50:17] knew how the priests conducted
[50:18] themselves and you know but this was a
[50:20] difference this is a different time that
[50:22] he would go into that same place and you
[50:24] know we know that this was a crisis
[50:26] point in Isaiah's life he he had come to
[50:29] a place where you know his brother
[50:31] brandman will go on to it soon that you
[50:32] know he he saw such a great example in
[50:35] in King Uzziah when King his I was was
[50:38] before he got lifted up and pride and he
[50:40] and he tried to take a priest place and
[50:42] and and burn incense there's a priest
[50:44] would and and you know we we won't read
[50:47] it but in seeking chronicles 26 you read
[50:49] about when King use I you know he was
[50:51] just 16 years old he came to the throne
[50:52] you know he he fully served the Lord and
[50:55] and God greatly blessed him everything
[50:58] he did he every enemy he wins to win
[51:00] against he rose victorious you know his
[51:02] his kingdom was maybe next to Solomon's
[51:04] very powerful Kingdom but then when he
[51:07] said when he strengthened himself he he
[51:08] got lifted up in his heart and because
[51:11] he thought anything he did God would
[51:12] just place it because that was his track
[51:14] record anything he did god bless - but
[51:16] that's because he was walking according
[51:17] to him - to the word of the Lord and
[51:19] that's why God blessed him but in he he
[51:22] felt for some reason he felt that he
[51:24] could take a priest place and he could
[51:26] do the priestly office in the temple and
[51:28] offer incense there at the altar but we
[51:30] know that you know you can't you can't
[51:32] mix officers you know a king is not a
[51:34] priest right so a priest is a special
[51:37] person a king is a special person and a
[51:39] king cannot be a priest so so there was
[51:42] a you know one of the priests and 80
[51:44] other
[51:44] Rhys tried to withstand use I said you
[51:46] shouldn't be doing this you're not a
[51:48] priest we're a priest you have no right
[51:50] but he got angry at them he said I'm
[51:51] gonna do it anyway and then God smote
[51:53] him with leprosy and he died and
[51:55] disgrace as a leper I had been separated
[51:58] from his people all because he thought
[52:00] he could do what he wanted to do but use
[52:02] but Isaiah was a contemporary of this
[52:04] King and he was under a great influence
[52:07] of of King Uzziah but there comes always
[52:11] comes a time in life where God wants to
[52:13] take every influence out of our lives
[52:16] that he can influence us as he wants to
[52:19] Isaiah was already a prophet he was
[52:22] already prophesying things but there was
[52:24] an influence in his life that was wrong
[52:26] I mean that he leaned too much on the
[52:28] arm of of the King and God had to take
[52:31] that influence away that God could speak
[52:34] to his prophet hallelujah so we see this
[52:37] this moment where Isaiah came into the
[52:40] temple this was building for years this
[52:42] wasn't an overnight one day everything's
[52:44] fine next day he's in crisis no got your
[52:46] things were being orchestrated in the
[52:48] lifeWise there and King Uzziah that God
[52:50] would bring the Prophet to this moment
[52:52] in his life so it was happen this was
[52:55] building for years so you know you know
[52:57] many times we never see crisis coming or
[53:00] even foresee it coming but God is not
[53:02] surprised God is in control of all
[53:05] things I mean so so brother bran would
[53:07] you know so you know the Lord is not
[53:11] surprised he knows the beginning from
[53:12] the end but it's really you know when
[53:15] crisis hits it really shows what we're
[53:17] made of it because when crisis hits and
[53:20] if we're you know if our hardest towards
[53:22] the Lord that's the one we will go to I
[53:24] mean but if our hardest towards the
[53:25] world will find our comfort and trying
[53:27] to alleviate the crisis in the world I
[53:29] mean but if you're a real believer in
[53:31] that scene of God is in you you'll turn
[53:33] to the Lord my help cometh from the Lord
[53:35] hallelujah that should be that should be
[53:38] where we've gone times of crisis I mean
[53:40] you know God knows how to kill an
[53:42] influence out of our lives that he
[53:44] doesn't want your brother man would say
[53:46] in the message influence now this young
[53:47] boy we find out sister speaking of King
[53:49] Uzziah he was you know he had godly
[53:53] parents and training when his daddy died
[53:55] his only 16 years old and the people
[53:57] took a maid
[53:58] and he came on the throne of power when
[54:00] he was only 16 years old and if you read
[54:02] his life he wasn't influenced by the
[54:04] politics of his country he didn't he
[54:07] didn't take the popular opinion he
[54:08] sought after God the Bible said now
[54:10] that's what made him such a great
[54:12] example to this young prophet at the
[54:14] same time Isaiah Isaiah the prophet
[54:16] lived in the days of Uzziah the king and
[54:19] both in being young together the Prophet
[54:21] and the king they were great chums
[54:22] together and Isiah stayed at the palace
[54:25] leaned upon the arm of the king and we
[54:27] find out that this young fellows
[54:29] influence influenced Isaiah he became a
[54:31] hero to Isaiah because he he made no
[54:35] differences in the people he never let
[54:36] anything sway him from one side to the
[54:38] other and he was determined to serve God
[54:41] and serve God alone and that's a great
[54:43] person to take example and we find out
[54:46] he never compromised with any of the
[54:47] heat heathen world's the heathen world
[54:49] after we've seen him build his kingdom
[54:51] so great and God was with them and
[54:53] blessed him now that's a great example
[54:55] but you can lean too much on even the
[54:58] writings influence because God wants us
[55:00] to come to a place where we where we
[55:02] stand on him and his word alone
[55:04] I mean went went went went when all the
[55:06] believers go sideways the world goes
[55:08] sideways
[55:08] we're remaining on the word I mean
[55:10] because you know God doesn't you know
[55:12] we're not believers because of some
[55:14] great ministry somewhere
[55:15] we're not believers because the music's
[55:17] jumping up and down we're not believers
[55:18] because we've got they even the message'
[55:20] now is I mean we're believers because
[55:22] God has revealed himself to us and the
[55:24] message comes reality in our souls I
[55:26] mean that's why we're believers of the
[55:28] night yo even if we never had a Bible or
[55:30] had another message that we could ever
[55:32] hear we would still be believers because
[55:35] as word as in us hallelujah I mean you
[55:39] take Abraham for example water you know
[55:41] you read 25 years Abraham walked with
[55:45] God at sin you know but then you when
[55:47] you read the moments where God spoke to
[55:49] him it just takes a few minutes to read
[55:51] just a few times in his presence he
[55:53] never had a church to go to I mean he
[55:56] didn't have a prophet he didn't have the
[55:57] seals come open he didn't have the book
[55:59] come open to him I mean he didn't have
[56:00] preaching he didn't have something you
[56:02] just stream he's had a few moments in
[56:04] the prints of God but it's so influenced
[56:06] him his whole life revolved around those
[56:09] meetings I meant that he staggered not
[56:10] at the promise of God
[56:12] he said we're gonna have the promised
[56:13] son Holly he went through great trials
[56:15] but it didn't change him amen
[56:18] what about us hallelujah amen so so it
[56:27] was incredible upheaval in the you know
[56:30] in Isaiah's life but the Lord had to
[56:33] remove the influence of King Uzziah
[56:36] because he is trusting too much in the
[56:38] King instead of trusting in the Lord
[56:40] himself as I said God wants us to stand
[56:42] on his word alone not numbers not a
[56:45] favorite ministry not anything but him
[56:48] amen
[56:50] we know desperation brings change when
[56:53] we have it easy there's not a lot of
[56:54] change we just keep going
[56:55] but when desperation strikes that's when
[56:58] change can happen I mean you take you
[57:01] take Hannah for example in the Bible you
[57:04] know her state that she found herself in
[57:07] pouring herself out before the Lord
[57:09] before the tabernacle that wasn't just
[57:12] an overnight thing that was years of
[57:15] building hallelujah amen because you
[57:19] know it wasn't just an overnight thing
[57:21] it wasn't just well she had a bad kind
[57:22] of day then she went and poured her life
[57:23] out before the Lord no this was year
[57:25] after year I mean where it said in 1st
[57:28] Samuel 1 and 4 and when the time that
[57:32] sorry and when the time was that
[57:35] elack ayah which is this is Hannah's
[57:37] husband he gave to Pena which is the
[57:40] other wife his wife and all of her sons
[57:43] and daughters portions so Hannah didn't
[57:46] have any children the other wife had
[57:48] sons and daughters and the and the other
[57:51] wife was her adversary it says in 1st
[57:53] Samuel 1 and 6 and her adversary also
[57:57] provoked her saw and to make her fret
[57:59] because the Lord had shut up her womb
[58:01] now if someone has multiple children
[58:03] that's over years so here is here it is
[58:06] now this is God God knows how to put us
[58:09] in a pressure cooker to reveal himself
[58:11] to us you know sometimes we go you know
[58:13] this world we have it too easy and you
[58:16] know this world is designed that we
[58:17] don't have pressure everything's fine
[58:19] you know we can get help straight away
[58:21] click of a button that's their God don't
[58:23] work that way he wants to move us into a
[58:25] certain state of being that he can
[58:27] reveal himself to us so here is here is
[58:30] Hanna you say will it take years
[58:31] sometimes it might God knows where he
[58:34] wants you to be holy and God will get
[58:36] you there
[58:37] hallelujah you say well I don't like
[58:40] going through the pressure cooker it'll
[58:42] be worth it all I mean when do you get
[58:43] through the other side and you should
[58:45] just count it all joy when you find
[58:47] yourself and divers trial thank you Lord
[58:49] I'm in this trial
[58:50] I'm counting a joy what do you mean
[58:52] you're going through the wringer glory
[58:53] for the wringer hallelujah I mean so if
[58:58] she had sons and daughters this was
[58:59] years of her own in her own household
[59:03] look not not someone somewhere else not
[59:06] even the neighbor in her own house here
[59:08] was here as the other wife of her
[59:10] husband was their adversary look at my
[59:12] children look they're growing up look
[59:14] they're learning to walk just you know
[59:15] that passive aggressive look at their
[59:17] grinding at her hallelujah what had to
[59:21] happen she had to come under an
[59:23] influence because she was go to birth a
[59:25] prophet she was gonna she's gonna be
[59:27] part of a dispensational change who is
[59:29] gonna go for a time of judges to a time
[59:31] of kings hallelujah so she wasn't just
[59:34] gonna have any child she was going to
[59:35] have a prophet
[59:36] hallelujah and so God had to get her
[59:39] into a place that when she received a
[59:41] child should give it to him hallelujah
[59:45] when she went to the when she went to
[59:48] Shiloh as they win every year she went
[59:53] and she she says my you know even her
[59:59] husband tries to console her and verse 8
[1:00:02] why do you weep she why we for sell and
[1:00:05] why eat us thou not is not by heart why
[1:00:08] as I heart grieved
[1:00:09] am I better to thee than seeing 10 am I
[1:00:12] not better to thee than ten sons it's
[1:00:15] even even the husband couldn't fix the
[1:00:17] problem God had to get her to a place
[1:00:20] hallelujah I might just lay broke
[1:00:24] because I wouldn't you think you know we
[1:00:25] go we want to get out of a trial we want
[1:00:28] someone to deliver us of it but
[1:00:30] sometimes God wants us to keep it keep
[1:00:31] us there I mean because otherwise if
[1:00:34] people put their hands on it then God
[1:00:35] hasn't brought you where you need to be
[1:00:37] hallelujah
[1:00:40] amen hey God is greater than what we're
[1:00:43] going through God is greater than our
[1:00:44] situation we have to look all things
[1:00:47] work together for good those that love
[1:00:49] God and are called according to his
[1:00:50] purpose I mean if this message is
[1:00:52] quicken your soul you're called
[1:00:53] according to his purpose
[1:00:55] hallelujah so you know so Shira and then
[1:01:00] and then so she goes to the temple she
[1:01:02] goes into Shiloh and in verse 10 it says
[1:01:04] and she was in bitterness of soul and
[1:01:07] prayed unto the Lord and whipsaw
[1:01:09] hallelujah
[1:01:11] then she pray she vowed a vowel speaks
[1:01:13] the Lord and in Eli who's a backslidden
[1:01:15] high priest looks at her and and and
[1:01:18] thinks that she's drunk she's in such a
[1:01:21] state she doesn't care she wasn't the
[1:01:23] only one and they're the you know you
[1:01:25] know in the tabernacle there's a busy
[1:01:27] place and us and that's why wouldn't you
[1:01:29] want to want to get you today you know
[1:01:31] just like I was a going to the temple he
[1:01:33] wasn't the only one there there are many
[1:01:35] people there but God met him there
[1:01:37] hallelujah and that's one of those key
[1:01:39] things you can be in great distress
[1:01:41] people you know I can be here God can
[1:01:44] come and super does she meet you you can
[1:01:45] have a Jubilee and others can look on
[1:01:47] and say what's going on with that person
[1:01:49] you'd be having a heavenly vision you
[1:01:51] can change your whole life
[1:01:53] how lujah amen so so here she was and
[1:01:58] and Eli thought she was drunk and you
[1:02:02] know Eli go sir
[1:02:03] how long will they'll be drunk and put
[1:02:05] away that wine and henna says no I'm not
[1:02:07] drunk
[1:02:08] I got a sorrowful spirit I've drunk
[1:02:10] neither wine nor strong drink I poured
[1:02:12] out my soul before the Lord count not
[1:02:14] thine hand maiden for a daughter of
[1:02:16] Belial for out of the abundance of my
[1:02:18] complaint in grief have I spoken here
[1:02:20] and to denilla I answered and said go on
[1:02:23] peace the God of Israel grant thee thy
[1:02:25] petition and thou has that thou has
[1:02:27] asked him and she took that from the
[1:02:29] Lord hallelujah and she received what
[1:02:31] she had need of coz she poured herself
[1:02:33] out God had to get it to that place
[1:02:35] hallelujah now an influencer definition
[1:02:40] of an oven influences the capacity to
[1:02:43] heaven and have an effect on the
[1:02:46] character development or behavior of
[1:02:49] someone or something or the effect
[1:02:53] itself so see a capacity to have an
[1:02:55] effect on the character development or
[1:02:57] behavior of someone or something now if
[1:03:00] our influence of our influence is a good
[1:03:03] influence so every everything we do has
[1:03:05] an influence on someone someone's
[1:03:08] watching doesn't matter what age we are
[1:03:10] someone's watching you and someone's
[1:03:12] actually aspiring to be like you so
[1:03:14] we've got to be very careful what
[1:03:16] influence are we projecting forth even
[1:03:19] you know and we we have to come to
[1:03:21] realization we are actually
[1:03:23] subconsciously influencing people you
[1:03:26] know I well I trust that you don't wake
[1:03:28] up in the morning and have a checklist
[1:03:29] I'm gonna influence this person this way
[1:03:31] I'm gonna influence this person this way
[1:03:32] you know I trust you don't have that
[1:03:34] kind of agenda that's pretty I'd be
[1:03:37] pretty scared scared if you have that
[1:03:39] kind of thing manipulating that way you
[1:03:41] know but you know you gotta be careful
[1:03:43] your influences as molding someone
[1:03:45] shaping someone and it can set them on a
[1:03:48] course in a certain direction rather em
[1:03:52] says so we must watch we influence
[1:03:55] others on what on what we do then when
[1:03:58] this man got stricken by this leprosy
[1:04:01] speaking of King Uzziah when he got
[1:04:03] lifted up in Pride this was a great
[1:04:04] lesson to that young prophet he found
[1:04:06] out by this being a great lesson to him
[1:04:09] that God orders his men to the place see
[1:04:12] man cannot order himself God orders his
[1:04:14] man God makes you what you are see and
[1:04:17] God orders his men and he mustn't try to
[1:04:20] take another's place and it was a lesson
[1:04:22] to Isaiah that he mustn't put his eyes
[1:04:24] on human beings for an example this is
[1:04:27] our example I meant not not one another
[1:04:31] this is our example I'm not a speck I'll
[1:04:34] just saying I'm not aspiring to be like
[1:04:36] you I'm aspiring to be like him even
[1:04:40] though I see him in you right so I
[1:04:43] appreciate that but I don't want to
[1:04:45] become I don't want to become a little
[1:04:48] heed one because God made me to be me
[1:04:52] but you see even come under an influence
[1:04:54] or someone you can such speaking like
[1:04:56] them acting like them dressing like them
[1:04:58] doing things so then what's happened
[1:04:59] you've come under their natural
[1:05:00] influence I want to become under the
[1:05:02] influence of this
[1:05:03] I'm in and that should be our main
[1:05:06] influence in life sure we do employ you
[1:05:08] understand what I mean
[1:05:09] yep because we do influence one another
[1:05:11] in a good way but I don't want to become
[1:05:13] a carbon copy of you I want to become a
[1:05:15] carbon copy of this right
[1:05:17] I trust that came out the right way you
[1:05:19] understand amen
[1:05:21] see and it was a listen to Isaiah that
[1:05:24] he mustn't put his eyes upon human
[1:05:26] beings for an example he must put his
[1:05:28] eyes on God
[1:05:29] now that's us any man any man is subject
[1:05:33] to mistakes he's subject to error
[1:05:34] because he's human he's subject to the
[1:05:36] violation of God's laws and he's subject
[1:05:38] to many things because Satan Timpson and
[1:05:40] he's just as human being and if God ever
[1:05:43] lifts his hands he'd fall that's all
[1:05:45] I've heard people say Oh Satan couldn't
[1:05:47] do that yes you just let God left us
[1:05:50] hand one time and watch what happens I
[1:05:53] mean you just watch one time God takes
[1:05:55] your God takes his hand off any of us
[1:05:57] weren't we're toast holy O Lord keep
[1:06:00] your mercy upon me don't even lift a
[1:06:02] finger off my life Lord hallelujah amen
[1:06:06] that's why she's I constantly plead God
[1:06:09] don't seem to have mercy on me keep him
[1:06:11] away from me you see I need God's mercy
[1:06:12] and we all need that now we find that I
[1:06:15] say he leaned heavily upon the good
[1:06:17] Kings arm and now the arm had been taken
[1:06:19] from him and the king was dead and died
[1:06:21] with leprosy and shame this is where I
[1:06:26] was okay he was influenced by heavenly I
[1:06:30] mean an earthly king but now God had to
[1:06:33] take that influence away and he was in
[1:06:35] the temple where he had been many times
[1:06:37] and he saw the Lord High and lifted up
[1:06:39] now such a few Scripture but think about
[1:06:42] it I doubt very much he was expecting
[1:06:44] that when he went into the temple that
[1:06:46] day I doubt very much he is planning I'm
[1:06:48] going to see God on a throne today I'm
[1:06:50] going to see it
[1:06:51] sirrah from come with a burning coal and
[1:06:53] touch my lips and say your sin
[1:06:55] iniquities been purged from you and God
[1:06:57] say he'll go for us and I'll say Here I
[1:06:59] am sin me I doubt very much that was on
[1:07:01] his agenda but God had an agenda God had
[1:07:04] a plan for his life and God brought him
[1:07:06] to that place hallelujah
[1:07:08] and so now here he was now he wasn't
[1:07:09] just in the he wasn't just in the
[1:07:11] presence now if you're in the presence
[1:07:13] of someone they're present they're there
[1:07:15] in the room like you're in
[1:07:17] my presence because I'm here if I go out
[1:07:19] of the room you no longer in my presence
[1:07:21] right so if we're in the presence of God
[1:07:23] God is here
[1:07:24] hallelujah so now here he was he comes
[1:07:27] into the temple God's presence comes
[1:07:29] down to him and he wasn't just in the
[1:07:32] presence of a king or some great priests
[1:07:34] or some great learning man he was in the
[1:07:36] presence of the center of everything
[1:07:39] wasn't just an earthly King wasn't just
[1:07:42] an angel here was the being that created
[1:07:44] all things brother man see that filled
[1:07:46] all time and space
[1:07:48] collie that goes out to the great
[1:07:49] eternal God came down to where his
[1:07:52] prophet was so he wasn't just in the
[1:07:54] presence of anyone or anything he was in
[1:07:57] the presence of the one who made all
[1:07:58] things who knew all things holy by all
[1:08:01] things consist he was in his presence
[1:08:05] hallelujah
[1:08:06] and when he had that visitation see God
[1:08:10] doesn't just come down just to make us a
[1:08:13] religious people that's not it
[1:08:14] God wants to reveal himself to us that
[1:08:17] will come to a place when he says he'll
[1:08:19] go for us you'll say Here I am Lord hit
[1:08:22] me Here I am in my father Here I am in
[1:08:24] my humanity send me O God hallelujah
[1:08:26] it's a now his whole life revolves
[1:08:30] around that one meeting it wasn't just
[1:08:33] wasn't that interesting or wasn't that a
[1:08:35] nice service no he met him he was in his
[1:08:39] presence and his presence impacted his
[1:08:42] life so much it never left him he wasn't
[1:08:46] just in the presence of a king he was in
[1:08:48] the Prince of the one who made all
[1:08:50] things all the entire universe all that
[1:08:54] creation is revolves around that one
[1:08:56] being and God came down to where he was
[1:09:00] to speak to him to break an influence of
[1:09:03] his life that he would look beyond his
[1:09:05] five senses and world is this this king
[1:09:08] in this way and this is who I am now he
[1:09:10] wanted to lift him up and say you're
[1:09:12] going to look beyond what you see what
[1:09:14] you think what you remember you've got
[1:09:16] to see me as I am because I have a job
[1:09:19] for you
[1:09:20] hallelujah and it's the same thing with
[1:09:22] you and I friends God has commissioned
[1:09:24] us I mean to take this word that's
[1:09:27] living Christ to the world
[1:09:30] that people would know that he's alive I
[1:09:32] mean that's how Commission that's our
[1:09:33] job I mean if God has ever met you I
[1:09:36] mean using the very one that I say I met
[1:09:38] you meet Pylea say your entire life
[1:09:41] should be wrapped around that visitation
[1:09:43] hallelujah not just for that moment and
[1:09:46] walk out and forget about it no I mean
[1:09:48] it's a grip you so influence you so
[1:09:51] consume you then all you can do is walk
[1:09:54] and live according to that walk
[1:09:56] according to his word hallelujah this is
[1:09:59] what church is about we'd be in his
[1:10:00] presence not in our presence but his
[1:10:03] presence would calm down his presence
[1:10:05] would grip us wholly and not just for a
[1:10:07] moment not for a service but a lifetime
[1:10:10] hallelujah his whole life you think of a
[1:10:14] man the prophets never said good things
[1:10:17] they rebuked Israel they they they
[1:10:20] pronounce judgment how could they do it
[1:10:22] because they met the god of glory holy
[1:10:26] they couldn't because I sir grips I mean
[1:10:28] by that they just had to be yielded
[1:10:31] because they they real this one is
[1:10:33] eternity he doesn't just hold it here's
[1:10:35] eternity and when life leaves this body
[1:10:37] where am I going to go I'm going to go
[1:10:39] into his presence hallelujah that's why
[1:10:42] you know Isaiah at the end of his life
[1:10:44] he has sawn asunder
[1:10:46] hallelujah why is that why did he go
[1:10:50] down that road because he went into the
[1:10:52] temple one day because this world had
[1:10:54] fallen apart and God caused it to fall
[1:10:56] apart that God would get a hold of him
[1:10:59] amen it's always darkest before dawn you
[1:11:05] may be going through the worst trial in
[1:11:08] your life there's a reason for it and
[1:11:10] it's not that you'd say I survived that
[1:11:11] one is that God would get a hold of you
[1:11:13] and God would God would grip you
[1:11:16] hallelujah amen brother MC is this is an
[1:11:22] influence of another I listen to a few
[1:11:25] of these he says and there that's where
[1:11:27] you make your mistake as the there is
[1:11:31] where so many righteous men bite the
[1:11:33] dust of shame by the dust of defeat
[1:11:35] because they begin to feel self secure
[1:11:37] this eyes a beefy I mean use I rather he
[1:11:40] got self secure the kingdoms established
[1:11:42] my enemies are subdued
[1:11:44] now I can relax I'm secure in my
[1:11:46] position we don't want to ever think
[1:11:49] that I believe in eternal security but
[1:11:52] we don't want to just sit back and say
[1:11:54] life is just gonna take care of itself
[1:11:56] life's not going to take care of itself
[1:11:58] I mean you've got to have a have a
[1:12:00] backbone and a zeal lord I wanna I want
[1:12:02] to see this word live I'm not going to
[1:12:04] compromise with the devil I'm not going
[1:12:06] to put up with his term he's on my terms
[1:12:08] and my terms of this word hallelujah and
[1:12:11] what he is what this word says he must
[1:12:13] obey it hallelujah

[1:14:44] fight to sign an unconditional surrender
[1:14:47] that means he has no say in what happens
[1:14:50] to him hallelujah this word declares
[1:14:52] that the devil has to come to a place of
[1:14:55] unconditional surrender why is that
[1:14:57] because he can't say well no can I just

[1:15:16] lived so long for Christ that no matter
[1:15:18] what he presents before you you'll take
[1:15:20] your choice whether you want it or not
[1:15:22] you've got to continue to serve God no
[1:15:25] matter what you was ten years ago it's
[1:15:27] what you are now the king got to a place
[1:15:32] that he thought within himself then he
[1:15:33] got lifted up pride God in his heart and
[1:15:36] that's what happens to us if you'll
[1:15:38] pardon this expression that's what
[1:15:41] happens to our churches throughout the
[1:15:43] country they're fine people and they're
[1:15:45] some of the best Church some of the best
[1:15:48] in the world goes to church I think the
[1:15:50] best in the world goes to church but the
[1:15:52] thing of it is the organization system
[1:15:54] gets lifted up and that's what happened
[1:15:56] to the Methodists that's what happened
[1:15:58] to the Baptist's that's what happened to
[1:15:59] the Nazarene to the pilgrim holiness to
[1:16:01] the Pentecostal lifted up self-willed
[1:16:05] self-centered pride that you can't tell
[1:16:08] nothing
[1:16:09] God can't find a way to get into their
[1:16:12] hearts it's because they become so no
[1:16:16] doll that nobody can tell them anything
[1:16:18] My Lord Jesus may we never ever ever get
[1:16:21] even close to that point may we never
[1:16:24] even even take a step towards being that
[1:16:26] way that God can tell us any one man
[1:16:28] can't tell us anything you know cuz we
[1:16:30] know it all and by building themselves
[1:16:33] around reasoning with brethren they
[1:16:36] build themselves around their Creed and
[1:16:38] when they do they leave God in the back
[1:16:39] we can do this as well we're not immune
[1:16:42] from these things amen
[1:16:44] that's what happens to doctors when they
[1:16:46] get so selfs into that they don't need
[1:16:48] any help from God that's when I don't
[1:16:51] want one fooling with me yes see when
[1:16:53] you leave God out of anything you I want
[1:16:55] you to leave me out to sea because you
[1:16:58] must always remember God first he says
[1:17:00] he got lifted up so many today you take
[1:17:02] a family of people that will start going
[1:17:04] to church and God will heal the little
[1:17:06] family he will bless them and give them
[1:17:08] the Holy Spirit in their life the little
[1:17:10] children will pray around the table
[1:17:11] they'll pray before they go to bed
[1:17:13] mother and father will join hands and
[1:17:15] pray and as long as they continue like
[1:17:17] that they'll stay a family but you let
[1:17:19] them first thing you know they don't
[1:17:21] have nothing at all junk car maybe
[1:17:23] riding around or maybe walking finally
[1:17:26] they'll get a good karabiner home the
[1:17:28] first thing you know then they want to
[1:17:31] get to what they the world calls a
[1:17:33] better class to associate with they move
[1:17:36] into a different neighborhood and in
[1:17:37] their youth they find out they've become
[1:17:39] influenced by the wrong influence you
[1:17:42] must always stay with the kingdom of God
[1:17:44] as and where the glory of God is pouring
[1:17:46] out stay where you can be spiritually
[1:17:48] fed day and night then the first thing
[1:17:50] you know separations come in the home
[1:17:52] and worldliness and they get lifted up
[1:17:58] Isaiah came to a place where those
[1:18:02] things didn't matter no more his whole
[1:18:05] life revolved around that meeting he
[1:18:09] says in the unchangeable God working in
[1:18:11] an unexpected way Isaiah the prophet a
[1:18:14] young fellow had leaned upon the good
[1:18:16] Kings arm and here's a good man
[1:18:18] and he had he had things easy but one
[1:18:21] day the king died and Isaiah the prophet
[1:18:23] weighed down
[1:18:24] the altar in the house of God and while
[1:18:25] he was praying there he was caught
[1:18:27] between his own sins in the vision and
[1:18:29] screamed out well as me when he'd seen
[1:18:31] the Angels was wings flying over their
[1:18:33] faces wings over their feet and crying
[1:18:35] holy holy unto the Lord he cried was me
[1:18:38] for I am a man of unclean lips he was
[1:18:40] caught in an unexpected time and an
[1:18:43] unexpected place he thought I'll go down
[1:18:44] and say my prayers and get up and go on
[1:18:46] because people believe I'm a good
[1:18:48] preacher or pastor or some another but
[1:18:50] he was caught there not only was he
[1:18:52] caught in this condition with the vision
[1:18:54] but he was caught with unclean lips in
[1:18:56] the house of the Living God
[1:18:58] oh brother if that don't search out
[1:19:00] through the city tonight and tomorrow
[1:19:02] morning of ministers that would stand
[1:19:03] and tell you there's no such thing as
[1:19:05] divine healing there's no such a thing
[1:19:07] as the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:09] there'd be some more crying out while
[1:19:11] smooth and clean lips as true yes very
[1:19:14] much so yet the Hebrew children they
[1:19:16] were caught and quite an in a
[1:19:18] predicament - they are caught in an
[1:19:20] unexpected place where they admit God
[1:19:22] God came to them in a fiery furnace an
[1:19:25] unexpected time an unexpected way but
[1:19:28] God is the unchangeable God and he does
[1:19:30] that he does it that way an unexpected
[1:19:33] place an unexpected time you know Moses
[1:19:37] was on the backside of the desert he led
[1:19:40] his sheep that way but there was an
[1:19:43] unexpected place for him to meet God in
[1:19:45] a burning bush he was just going about
[1:19:47] his everyday life and God came to him
[1:19:50] and his whole life before that he failed
[1:19:53] to deliver Israel because he's trying to
[1:19:56] in a political way he was leaning on his
[1:19:58] understanding what his mind could do but
[1:20:01] when he met the burning bush that all
[1:20:03] changed that all evaporated
[1:20:05] that'll left because now his whole life
[1:20:07] was now it wasn't just because he knew
[1:20:09] his mother raised him and said you're
[1:20:11] gonna be the deliverer and would tell
[1:20:13] the testimony of his birth and how you
[1:20:15] know and how he was led into Pharaoh's
[1:20:17] house and all those things that
[1:20:18] testimony burned in him he knew was true
[1:20:21] he believed it but God had to come and
[1:20:23] actually bring her bring it that it
[1:20:25] wasn't his mother's testimony no more it
[1:20:27] became his testimony for him I mean and
[1:20:30] when that happened his whole life
[1:20:32] revolved around that voice the voice of
[1:20:35] God that's all he cared about how the
[1:20:37] law
[1:20:38] hallelujah how we need that kind of
[1:20:41] thing
[1:20:43] amen you say well why are you saying
[1:20:46] these things this message is a reality
[1:20:48] it's Jesus Christ it's not it's not a
[1:20:51] bunch of ideas or understanding or
[1:20:53] reasoning it's a person I mean and God
[1:20:56] wants to influence us more than just
[1:20:57] being at you having a church culture
[1:20:59] more than just having a message culture
[1:21:01] it's not what it's about
[1:21:02] I miss about God coming down and
[1:21:05] visiting us what is going to hold when
[1:21:07] the squeeze gets worse what is going to
[1:21:09] hold it's you knowing God as what will
[1:21:12] hold you I mean the only reason you know
[1:21:14] what would happen if the authorities
[1:21:16] closed the doors what would happen would
[1:21:20] we still be believers I believe we still
[1:21:22] would be believers and may because it's
[1:21:24] not based on I'm not a believer because
[1:21:26] things are going well I'm not I believe
[1:21:28] it because we've got charitable status
[1:21:29] I'm going to believe it because we can
[1:21:32] meet here it's not why I'm a believer I
[1:21:33] don't believe because I've met him and
[1:21:35] he's a living reality to me hallelujah
[1:21:38] that's got to be the reason why could
[1:21:40] why could they believers under the Great
[1:21:42] Tribulation oh you know under the Dark
[1:21:43] Ages and you know that great persecution
[1:21:45] they didn't fold up and quit they kept
[1:21:48] going it didn't stop them it didn't faze
[1:21:51] them why because they had a heavenly
[1:21:55] visitation and they realized that these
[1:21:58] people when Jesus said don't fear the
[1:22:00] one that can destroy the body they fear
[1:22:02] the one that can destroy the body and
[1:22:03] soul in hell and they meant that one who
[1:22:06] said those things and they realized my
[1:22:08] life is in his hands they're not in the
[1:22:10] authorities hands it doesn't matter what
[1:22:11] they can do to me
[1:22:12] the only outcome of what they can do
[1:22:14] them is I can die and I want to go to
[1:22:15] heaven anyway so why should I worry
[1:22:19] don't let fear your faith never
[1:22:22] ever let fear your faith Holly
[1:22:24] that's a problem with the news it's all
[1:22:26] fear and this happened here and this
[1:22:28] happened here and this happened here and
[1:22:29] this is happening over here it's all
[1:22:31] fear and worry and you know why is the
[1:22:33] world like it is because it's being put
[1:22:35] in front of us people's minds are
[1:22:38] troubled by so many things why because
[1:22:40] it's all people read till people feed
[1:22:42] upon what we shouldn't be caught up on
[1:22:44] that we should be aware of things
[1:22:45] happening but we shouldn't be caught up
[1:22:47] in it hallelujah this thing should
[1:22:49] should what our main
[1:22:51] influence amen
[1:22:56] hello yeah so Moses you think about it
[1:23:01] he was his mother said the God of
[1:23:04] Abraham Isaac and Jacobs gonna you gonna
[1:23:06] deliver his children hallelujah and then
[1:23:09] here he was he made him I'm the God of
[1:23:11] thy father's Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:23:14] hallelujah
[1:23:15] they changed his life the Apostle Paul
[1:23:20] he was the incredible man he purposed in
[1:23:25] his heart is going to destroy this the
[1:23:26] sect of Jesus of Nazareth he had his own
[1:23:30] and maybe he went down the Damascus Road
[1:23:32] more than once but he met someone there
[1:23:36] he read about this God and the scrolls
[1:23:38] and he thought he knew who he was but
[1:23:42] when that one that the very God that had
[1:23:44] the word written I mean the one that
[1:23:47] anointed Moses to write the word or
[1:23:48] Isaiah or Jeremiah one of the prophets
[1:23:50] when that one came and met him he says
[1:23:54] Lord who art thou who are you hallelujah
[1:23:57] all the influences are destroyed right
[1:23:59] there the high priests influence the
[1:24:02] Pharisee the Pharisee influence the
[1:24:04] political others his own agenda he was
[1:24:06] easily as a Pharisee of the Pharisees to
[1:24:08] be a Pharisee the pharisees you're gonna
[1:24:09] put energy in you can't be a lazy
[1:24:12] Pharisee and be Pharisee the Pharisees
[1:24:13] you're gonna be devout you're gonna be
[1:24:15] serious you're gonna study you're going
[1:24:16] to dedicate your life you're gonna do
[1:24:18] everything all of that influence died
[1:24:23] because God didn't want him to be a
[1:24:25] Pharisee of the Pharisees he didn't
[1:24:27] wanted to climb some ivory tower he was
[1:24:30] the Prophet messenger to the first age
[1:24:31] he had to hit the place law and grace in
[1:24:34] their positions hallelujah
[1:24:36] hey men God wants to reveal himself to
[1:24:40] us he doesn't want us to be church
[1:24:43] members he doesn't want to go through a
[1:24:45] group he doesn't want us to go through a
[1:24:47] Great Tribulation he wants us to go on a
[1:24:49] rapture he wants us to meet him
[1:24:52] hallelujah
[1:24:54] hey man the Apostle Paul he had a desire
[1:25:00] to to put these ones in prison he made
[1:25:04] the Lord
[1:25:05] good lord who out there and the Lord
[1:25:08] said I am Jesus who now he says all so
[1:25:14] the voice speaks to him Saul Saul why
[1:25:15] persecutest thou me and he said who art
[1:25:18] thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus
[1:25:20] whom they're persecuted that's hard for
[1:25:21] thee to kick against the pricks his
[1:25:24] whole life was now a brother one calls a
[1:25:26] christ-centered life it wasn't a
[1:25:29] Jerusalem centered life or a temple
[1:25:30] centered life or a Pharisee centered
[1:25:32] life Christ word centered life and then
[1:25:37] he comes many years later through great
[1:25:39] hardships through great trials and he
[1:25:42] says to King Agrippa he relates the
[1:25:44] testimony of the road to Damascus he
[1:25:46] says I was not disobedient to the
[1:25:48] heavenly version hallelujah and then
[1:25:51] brother Branham would meet the pillar of
[1:25:53] fire on on their high River and even
[1:25:55] before that when he as a young young boy
[1:25:57] sees a whirlwind coming to a popular
[1:25:59] tree he's carrying water Ferrer's for
[1:26:01] his daddy still he he walked past that

[1:26:07] different time and he was all upset I

[1:26:14] tree and speaks to him don't smoke or
[1:26:17] drink or defy yourself in any way you
[1:26:20] know I've got to work for you when
[1:26:22] you're older what happened God came he
[1:26:25] was trying to get a hold of his prophet
[1:26:27] I mean that that there be a he would be
[1:26:29] the influence in this life amen and then
[1:26:33] brother bran would would would take take
[1:26:36] X 26 win win and Paul said I was not
[1:26:39] disobedient to the heavenly vision and

[1:27:34] be just a little child in the Phaeton to
[1:27:36] be mature in the faith hallelujah I want
[1:27:38] to see the victory of the Cross in my
[1:27:39] life is that why you gather other I want

[1:27:57] come that's what you shall receive
[1:28:01] how lujah paul's whole life was changed
[1:28:06] because of that road that that one
[1:28:08] moment on the road to damascus now
[1:28:15] Isaiah's in the temple we're gonna go it
[1:28:19] was gonna go back there but he was the
[1:28:22] first thing he he saw he saw the Lord
[1:28:26] High and lifted up and his train filled
[1:28:27] the temple and he saw the serums one was
[1:28:30] crying to the other saying holy holy
[1:28:32] holy Lord God Almighty now so it wasn't
[1:28:36] just supernatural beings were there God
[1:28:39] was there
[1:28:40] now the serums are crying out and it's
[1:28:44] the same thing these holy yo so these
[1:28:47] seraphim's
[1:28:48] they're the burners they they they
[1:28:50] receive the worship also you know they
[1:28:51] they they cleanse the worshiper here
[1:28:54] they are crying holy holy holy is the
[1:28:56] Lord God Almighty and it was just one of
[1:28:58] them crying to the other and the post of
[1:29:00] the place was moving because of us and
[1:29:03] then notice these ones they they they
[1:29:06] had six wings to cover their faces to
[1:29:10] cover their feet and tuefel were for
[1:29:12] flying hallelujah so these ones even
[1:29:15] than the prints of God who knew no sin
[1:29:17] had their eyes covered their feet
[1:29:19] covered and they and they had when today
[1:29:21] they were they were they were clothed
[1:29:23] with humility with reverence and hour in
[1:29:26] service and this is how we should be a
[1:29:29] members because how they were
[1:29:32] as how people should become with
[1:29:34] reverence I think we should Revere God
[1:29:37] we should respect God he's God he's not
[1:29:41] an idea he's not a man's thing he's God
[1:29:44] he gives you life he brought you to the
[1:29:46] earth he allowed you to be here even now
[1:29:48] amen you didn't find him he found you
[1:29:51] you weren't seeking the Bible says no
[1:29:53] man seekers after God God seeks after
[1:29:55] man Holloway he found you here and he
[1:29:58] made away
[1:29:58] I mean before you'd ever be coming to
[1:30:00] this life that the lamb was slain before
[1:30:02] the foundation of the world and when
[1:30:03] that was happened he had the Lamb's Book
[1:30:05] of Life and your names on it
[1:30:07] hallelujah he's God amen why do we
[1:30:10] worship him not because he gives us not
[1:30:12] because this is me I don't worship
[1:30:14] because he answers prayer I wish him coz
[1:30:17] of who he is he's worthy of worship I
[1:30:21] mean I don't worship because here
[1:30:22] because things are going well though I
[1:30:24] give blessings and then if things don't
[1:30:26] go well I don't know it's not base it
[1:30:28] shouldn't be our base now walk with them
[1:30:30] should never be a based on on how well
[1:30:32] you perceive your walk as going amen the
[1:30:35] but your worship should be based on coz
[1:30:37] of who he is I mean when he died he he
[1:30:40] he expressed the fullness of his love to
[1:30:41] you I have redeemed you wholly it's not
[1:30:44] just that but he said for holos in you I
[1:30:45] am Elijah the Prophet before the grain
[1:30:47] dreadful day the Lord whose eye God
[1:30:49] whose whose you in the scripture you
[1:30:52] hallelujah Amen that we don't have to go
[1:30:55] through a Great Tribulation so we should
[1:30:58] worship because he's God Amen hallelujah
[1:31:03] worship coz of who he is now notice I
[1:31:07] say who had been leaning on his arm and
[1:31:09] saw him die under the judgment of God
[1:31:10] and when he saw these holy beings that
[1:31:12] was next to the sight of God the serums
[1:31:14] crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[1:31:16] and them holy angels covered their face
[1:31:19] holy angels covered holy faces in the
[1:31:22] midst of a holy God then who are we oh
[1:31:24] you Methodist Baptist Christian
[1:31:27] Pentecostal shall we then when holy
[1:31:29] angels had their holy faces under the
[1:31:32] wings to stand in the prints of God when
[1:31:34] the angels are being that's actually
[1:31:36] beyond angels angels don't stand there
[1:31:37] only the seraphim's there beyond the
[1:31:39] Angels and God so whole until they
[1:31:41] covered their faces and the presence of
[1:31:44] a holy God and the only thing they
[1:31:45] could say was holy holy holy is the Lord
[1:31:48] God Almighty whew
[1:31:49] a special covering for them to stand in
[1:31:52] the presence of God what kind of a
[1:31:54] covering do we need we have they had to
[1:31:56] be covered now I want to say this the
[1:31:58] blood of Jesus Christ is all-sufficient
[1:32:00] see Christ never died for them
[1:32:02] seraphim's no no but they were created
[1:32:04] beings he never died for angels he died
[1:32:07] for sinners see he never died for holy
[1:32:09] people he died for the unholy hallelujah
[1:32:13] and as long as you think you're holy he
[1:32:16] never done you he never done you no good
[1:32:18] but when you realize you're nothing when
[1:32:20] when then he died he died for you see
[1:32:23] when you realize that you're nothing
[1:32:24] then he's the he's the one you are the
[1:32:28] one he died for God's all holy there's
[1:32:30] nothing to him but holiness that's all
[1:32:32] purity now let's note these wings for a
[1:32:35] few minutes we find out two wings
[1:32:37] covered to his face with my thing even
[1:32:39] holy angels covered their holy faces and
[1:32:42] the prints of a holy God and the only
[1:32:44] thing they could say was holy holy holy
[1:32:46] is the Lord God Almighty holy holy holy
[1:32:48] Lord God Almighty and we told that they
[1:32:50] cried day and night that's the first
[1:32:52] step from God coming down day and night
[1:32:54] no letting up and you think that we make
[1:32:56] a lot of noise what do you think about
[1:32:58] millions of those around the throne with
[1:33:00] a voice that shook the temple pillars
[1:33:02] with only one of them crying holy holy
[1:33:04] holy I mean you know his voice shook the
[1:33:07] temple when millions of them crying
[1:33:09] around the throne holy holy holy Lord
[1:33:11] God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God
[1:33:14] Almighty with wings over their faces
[1:33:15] wings over their feet with wings and
[1:33:18] reverence respects oh my now there's no
[1:33:20] reverence or respects for anything that
[1:33:22] that talks about holiness you talk about
[1:33:24] holiness you're a Holy Roller there's no
[1:33:27] reverence their respects for neither God
[1:33:29] has people or his word now where are
[1:33:31] these bunch going to wind up where's
[1:33:33] this irreverent group going to wind up
[1:33:35] then where will this irreverent branch
[1:33:37] wind up the ones that hasn't got no
[1:33:39] respects at all for God you know it used
[1:33:41] to be if a woman or a man said they're
[1:33:43] Christian people respected it but today
[1:33:45] they they just kind of like to see how
[1:33:49] much fun they can make out of it see a
[1:33:50] reverend group me whoa see you know what
[1:33:53] this is the reason they're and they're
[1:33:55] not conscious that that's the truth
[1:33:57] they're not conscious of God they don't
[1:33:59] remember
[1:33:59] that the Bible said that the angels of
[1:34:01] God and kempt about those that fear him
[1:34:03] they don't only just come and visit them
[1:34:05] they stick their tents down Amen
[1:34:08] Alleluia amen
[1:34:12] so this is if angels are like that think
[1:34:20] about it
[1:34:21] how should we be he says but the blood
[1:34:23] the blood is the covering we need to go
[1:34:25] into his presence
[1:34:27] hallelujah now his presence also brings
[1:34:30] out what's in you heloo yeah
[1:34:33] now the Apostles the apostles were with
[1:34:36] the Lord three and a half years they
[1:34:38] walked with him they saw incredible
[1:34:40] things before the Lord called them to be
[1:34:44] to be disciples he didn't know what was
[1:34:47] in him they were fishermen tax
[1:34:49] collectors whatever they were you know
[1:34:52] but but but that seed that was in them
[1:34:54] laid dormant because we know that the
[1:34:55] scripture says in the book of Hebrews
[1:34:57] that the that the yo it says that that
[1:35:02] the for the earth was drinketh the rain
[1:35:05] that cometh off upon it and brings forth
[1:35:07] herbs meat for them that whom it's
[1:35:08] dressed even receives blessing from God
[1:35:11] but that which bear a thorns and briers
[1:35:13] is rejected and as nigh under cursing
[1:35:16] whose end is to be burned but beloved we
[1:35:18] are persuaded bear things of you and
[1:35:20] things that accompany salvation though
[1:35:22] thus we speak and that your and the Lord
[1:35:26] also see the rain falls on the just and
[1:35:27] the unjust you know the sunlight falls
[1:35:29] it comes on the just and the unjust so
[1:35:31] what is it so these seeds in the earth
[1:35:33] if you if you plant a garden you don't
[1:35:35] know what they are necessarily yeah but
[1:35:37] you plant them the best way to find out
[1:35:39] what's in them is to sunlight the right
[1:35:41] soil temperature and water and you'll
[1:35:43] see it come forth so it's like the
[1:35:45] disciples you know they were just
[1:35:48] regular Jewish people but in them was to
[1:35:51] be more than just a fisherman
[1:35:53] but it had to come to life so now they
[1:35:56] they they will call into the very
[1:35:57] presence of the one of he who who had
[1:36:00] eternal life now it brought out who who
[1:36:05] so for example being in his presence
[1:36:06] like that brought out who Judas really
[1:36:09] was
[1:36:09] you could never have told with your when
[1:36:13] Jesus
[1:36:13] he's a son of perdition who could have
[1:36:15] told you no Judas Judas was there at the
[1:36:19] Last Supper
[1:36:20] and and Jesus said that one of you is
[1:36:22] going to betray me they didn't all say
[1:36:24] oh it's Judas always thought he'd be the
[1:36:26] one they'll ask the question is it means
[1:36:28] that me who is it
[1:36:29] they couldn't even he was so close to he
[1:36:31] was so close to the Lord himself but
[1:36:33] they couldn't even tell what was in him
[1:36:34] I mean but the very presence of God was
[1:36:37] bringing out what was in Judas and you
[1:36:41] know they couldn't even tell who he was
[1:36:43] they couldn't even tell the reason he
[1:36:46] was even upon the earth was to betray
[1:36:47] the Messiah but the Prince the Lord
[1:36:51] brought it out when we're not I believe
[1:36:54] it's Mary took an alabaster box and
[1:36:57] ported upon his head was he when he said
[1:37:00] it meet it's recorded in Matthew Mark
[1:37:04] and I believe look but also John and
[1:37:06] it's only in the Gospel of John under
[1:37:09] that eagle anointing where where it
[1:37:12] actually describes Judas as being a
[1:37:15] thief the other Gospels some of the
[1:37:19] other disciples had as it says in
[1:37:21] Matthew 26 but when his disciples saw it
[1:37:23] they had egged Ignatian saying to what
[1:37:26] purposes this waste their mark 14 and
[1:37:30] there were some that had egged Ignatian
[1:37:32] within themselves and said why was this
[1:37:34] waste of the ointment made so aMDA and
[1:37:37] even the lion anointing and the ox
[1:37:39] anointing and in the and and I believe
[1:37:42] it's in Luke as well burned heaven here
[1:37:43] on me it didn't identify the heart of
[1:37:45] Judas but under that Eagle anointing
[1:37:48] that was on the Gospel John it doesn't
[1:37:51] say now it recorded more than just what
[1:37:54] was coming out of their mouths or out of
[1:37:56] Judas mouth and went to the heart of
[1:37:58] Judas but he didn't care about the poor
[1:38:00] he was the thief and he carried the bag
[1:38:02] so the word now in that end time I mean
[1:38:05] he with me identified what was in him
[1:38:08] hallelujah has the same eagle anointing
[1:38:11] that came upon the church in these last
[1:38:12] days as to identify what sinner people I
[1:38:15] mean when the people come into his
[1:38:17] presence it brings out what's within
[1:38:19] them hallelujah so even as you sit under
[1:38:22] the word what's happening is what in you
[1:38:24] comes out I mean what as in you as
[1:38:26] identify
[1:38:27] hallelujah but we're going to understand
[1:38:29] it's not only good seed in our lives I
[1:38:31] mean there's this carnality this pride
[1:38:34] there's all kind of things that come
[1:38:36] forth and God has to pluck them out I
[1:38:38] mean you take you take the Apostle Peter
[1:38:40] for example hallelujah
[1:38:43] here he was he's a fisherman God had
[1:38:46] ordained him already that he'd be the
[1:38:48] spokesman of x2 God knew when he is a
[1:38:51] fisherman before Jesus called him he is
[1:38:53] going to have the key to the kingdom God
[1:38:55] knew where he had to come to but here
[1:38:57] was here was Peter in the presence of
[1:38:59] God and and you know even the Lord
[1:39:02] Himself when when when when Jesus asked
[1:39:05] them who do men say that I am they said
[1:39:07] well you are Jeremias or Elias or one of
[1:39:09] the prophets but he asked the question
[1:39:11] who do you say that I am and Peter was
[1:39:12] the first once they down at the Christ
[1:39:14] the Son of Living God and then so even
[1:39:16] even you know even Jesus would say
[1:39:18] blessed are thou simon barjona flesh and
[1:39:20] blood has not revealed this to you but
[1:39:22] my father in heaven hallelujah and upon
[1:39:24] this rock I'll build my church but then
[1:39:26] even even Peter would would would come
[1:39:29] and he would try and yell with you and
[1:39:30] the Lord would say I'm gonna be
[1:39:32] crucified I'm gonna be handed to the
[1:39:33] heads of wicked men and Peter tried to
[1:39:35] stop him and and Jesus said to his face
[1:39:39] get behind me Satan hallelujah he wasn't
[1:39:43] talking about the man about the
[1:39:45] anointing upon the man so when you think
[1:39:47] about it if there was the question of
[1:39:50] who would betray him in the upper room I
[1:39:52] mean I mean you know who would betray
[1:39:53] him you'd really think would it be Peter
[1:39:55] Jesus already called him Satan but it
[1:39:58] wasn't him but Peter had to come to a
[1:40:01] place of crisis he says oh you know I'll
[1:40:05] die with you you know I won't deny you
[1:40:08] and the very word himself looked into
[1:40:10] Peters eyes and said before the
[1:40:12] crows three times you'll deny me thrice
[1:40:13] you will deny me and Peter basically
[1:40:16] said he didn't say it out loud but
[1:40:17] within his heart he said I won't know I
[1:40:19] won't
[1:40:20] oh my why God had to bring that out of
[1:40:24] him it was the presence of the Lord
[1:40:26] brought that out of Peter sometimes we
[1:40:28] come to places we fall on our faces and
[1:40:31] then we roll down the hill a few times
[1:40:32] and we think my my my how did I do this
[1:40:35] and and you saw the devil did it and the
[1:40:37] devil says he's saying don't give me
[1:40:38] credit for what you're doing
[1:40:40] we blame the devil too much sometimes oh
[1:40:43] it's Satan okay no it's just our
[1:40:45] humanity getting in the way
[1:40:46] oh yeah hey man so here he was penises I
[1:40:50] won't deny you law basically and then of
[1:40:53] course he does because the word is
[1:40:54] always true and he whips weeps bitterly
[1:40:58] he weeps bitterly and he goes his way
[1:41:03] hallelujah God had to have him there
[1:41:06] sometimes the vessels got to be crushed
[1:41:09] in order to be built
[1:41:11] hallelujah even even even brother ban
[1:41:14] talks about it in his ministry Lord just
[1:41:16] put me on the wheel crushed me over and
[1:41:17] built me up again hallelujah see here he
[1:41:20] was he had denied the Lord and then and
[1:41:24] then the Lord is resurrected and then
[1:41:27] the Lord tells he says go tell my
[1:41:30] disciples and Peter hallelujah and then
[1:41:34] now they're fishing that's a new day
[1:41:37] they're fishing and Peter and yeah and
[1:41:40] then they hear a voice on the bank have
[1:41:42] you caught any fish ever caught any meat
[1:41:44] and then no doubt Peter's frustrated no
[1:41:48] I mean fishing all night and then John
[1:41:52] looks that eagle vision looks tells
[1:41:54] Peter it's the Lord and then Peter
[1:41:57] there's something about a believer when
[1:42:00] you know you failed I've just got to get
[1:42:02] back in your presence lon Allu yeah cuz
[1:42:05] I know your Bloods enough I know you're
[1:42:07] forgiving me and he didn't know he
[1:42:09] didn't know he's gonna forgive buddy but
[1:42:11] he just dived off the boat hallelujah
[1:42:13] swam onto the bank came into the
[1:42:15] presence of the Lord he didn't know if
[1:42:17] he'd be received or condemned or what
[1:42:19] but he is something obscene I've got to
[1:42:21] go I've got to be with a masterís
[1:42:23] hallelujah hallelujah amen and then he
[1:42:27] says and then G says Peter do you love
[1:42:29] me
[1:42:29] I yes I love you feed my sheep Peter do
[1:42:34] you love me feed my lambs I think you
[1:42:35] asked them three times and then the last
[1:42:37] time Peter says Jesus do you love me
[1:42:40] Peter he says Lord you know I love you
[1:42:42] hallelujah even though he fails even
[1:42:45] though he his own pride got in the way
[1:42:47] amen didn't change that was the Prince
[1:42:51] Lord brought out really what was in him
[1:42:53] you know I Love You Lord hallelujah
[1:42:58] hallelujah and that holds true today
[1:43:04] amen
[1:43:07] Pilate Pilate had the opportunity here
[1:43:12] he was so influenced gonna finish with
[1:43:14] us maybe I should have finished that but
[1:43:16] Pilate was so influenced by the his
[1:43:19] political position in life he knew Jesus
[1:43:23] was not worthy to be crucified he says I
[1:43:26] find no fault in this man but because of
[1:43:29] his political position in the country he
[1:43:32] wasn't willing to let Jesus go and he
[1:43:35] had the opportunity you think about it
[1:43:37] here he's coming to this crowning part
[1:43:40] of his ministry he's gonna pay for the
[1:43:42] sins of the world he will never Pilate
[1:43:44] will never stand in his presence again
[1:43:46] and he didn't have one opportunity he
[1:43:49] had two opportunities just stand there
[1:43:51] before the Lord of glory hallelujah but
[1:43:53] he was so fixed and in his political
[1:43:55] position and the Jews are doing this and
[1:43:57] this is going on and Caesar will be
[1:43:59] upset and he missed his opportunity I
[1:44:02] mean to beg for mercy for his own soul
[1:44:07] it was the government that was
[1:44:09] influencing him to do that just the
[1:44:11] government what about you and I friends
[1:44:15] I trust I trust when you comb over your
[1:44:20] life you say what is influencing me the
[1:44:24] Lord knows he doesn't want us to be
[1:44:27] influenced just by man he doesn't want
[1:44:30] us to lean on anybody he wants us to
[1:44:33] lean on his word amen but that when we
[1:44:36] are all alone we are standing not
[1:44:38] because of someone else not because
[1:44:40] we'll even be seen but because we can
[1:44:42] stand because we are influenced by his
[1:44:44] word and it doesn't matter what people
[1:44:47] say or do around us I know peer
[1:44:49] pressure's real I know the pressure of
[1:44:50] society is real I know they look at us a
[1:44:53] funny way I know they don't like us the
[1:44:54] spirit of them hates us I know that's
[1:44:56] true but we have such a parentless word
[1:44:59] there's a power in this word I mean that
[1:45:02] we can walk unconscious of criticism we
[1:45:04] can walk unconscious of what the
[1:45:07] devil tries to do a pepra shall we can
[1:45:09] walk above those things I mean because
[1:45:11] of his presence hallelujah because
[1:45:15] remember when God reveals himself to us
[1:45:17] in these days we don't just have a
[1:45:20] visitation any Leafs no it gives us a
[1:45:22] visitation because he wants to fill us
[1:45:24] that he will be in us to the very one
[1:45:27] that made us is earnest and walked in us
[1:45:28] every day hallelujah so who is
[1:45:32] influencing you may it not be may it not
[1:45:36] be my culture might not be how I was
[1:45:39] raised
[1:45:40] might not be my personality may not be
[1:45:42] my past
[1:45:43] Amen may not be may not be trouble from
[1:45:46] the past or anything may not be any of
[1:45:48] those things influenced me might just be
[1:45:50] his word influencing me I mean that's
[1:45:53] how he wants us to be knows what this
[1:45:55] message came I mean that we would be
[1:45:57] built into his image I mean that we
[1:45:58] would walk because what is the gospel is
[1:46:01] that God and man become one that it's
[1:46:05] not you the church in God or you the
[1:46:08] preacher and God it's you and God alone
[1:46:10] lets Abraham was the pattern it was God
[1:46:14] in him walking through hardship trial
[1:46:17] whatever more he backs that a couple of
[1:46:19] times but God didn't quit on him I mean
[1:46:22] but it was him and about that but that's
[1:46:23] the pattern and that's the pattern of
[1:46:25] the believers life
[1:46:25] same thing with Abraham I mean God calls
[1:46:28] you leave leave this huh leave this
[1:46:30] place you used to leave this yo leave
[1:46:33] your culture leave leave whatever you
[1:46:35] used to do in the world and follow me
[1:46:37] who had that call I was a drunken
[1:46:39] University God spoke to me leave us walk
[1:46:43] with me I said Lord I'll walk with you
[1:46:45] however cuz he washed all my sins away
[1:46:47] you're worthy but did I know where I was
[1:46:50] going no way hallelujah if you went back
[1:46:53] through the past five years of your life
[1:46:55] I'd doubt very much most of us would
[1:46:57] even conceive of being here amen
[1:47:01] I can go back a bit further and I would
[1:47:04] never have even my wildest night miss
[1:47:06] think I'd been Wellington but God wanted
[1:47:09] us here that's where God wants you to be
[1:47:12] that's the main thing hallelujah I don't
[1:47:15] mean that as a joke I never planned
[1:47:16] about moving to this place but God said
[1:47:19] move there here we are
[1:47:21] hallelujah but you got to recognize God
[1:47:23] has your life pre-planned out I mean but
[1:47:26] you got to stay surrendered to him
[1:47:28] through every part of it he said I'm
[1:47:30] going through great things God is using
[1:47:32] those things to reveal himself in a
[1:47:34] greater way to you it's not a vain trial
[1:47:36] it's not he doesn't do it because he
[1:47:38] hates you it doesn't cause he's mad with
[1:47:39] you but he's pleased with you he wants
[1:47:42] to see you living your full potential
[1:47:43] amen he didn't want eyes they're living
[1:47:45] under the privilege of the king he
[1:47:47] wanted to be lifted up to see from
[1:47:48] eternity to eternity
[1:47:50] color is the same thing with us he
[1:47:52] doesn't want us under the influence of
[1:47:53] just some worldly think he wants us
[1:47:55] under the influence of his word that we
[1:47:56] can see from east we came from eternity
[1:47:58] and we're going to eternity hallelujah
[1:48:01] so we should just rejoice he say it's
[1:48:04] not easy it's not meant to be easy but
[1:48:06] it's not me to always be hard hallelujah
[1:48:09] but God is molding and shaping us you
[1:48:11] know we have mountaintop experiences I
[1:48:13] believe we're going to have a whole
[1:48:14] bunch of them at camp
[1:48:15] but you can't live on the mountaintop no
[1:48:18] fruit is growing on a mountaintop it's
[1:48:20] growing in the valley hallelujah but
[1:48:23] take your mountaintop experience down to
[1:48:25] the valley hallelujah and rejoice amen
[1:48:29] that's why you've got to go back you say
[1:48:31] Lord you called me here you think about

[1:48:48] my sins away and he transformed me you

[1:48:53] became in your book hallelujah became so

[1:49:09] guided me through all of trials and
[1:49:11] hardships you guided me hallelujah and
[1:49:15] God doesn't guide us a place just to say
