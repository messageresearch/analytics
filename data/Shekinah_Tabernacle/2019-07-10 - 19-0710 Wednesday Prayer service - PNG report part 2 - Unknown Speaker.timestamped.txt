[0:00] back and forward so he's very smart man
[0:02] but he was he was the district fresh
[0:06] Britta of the same denomination brother
[0:08] cops he wasn't two years ago that
[0:11] denomination took him to America I can't
[0:14] remember the name of it across
[0:16] denomination they they took him to
[0:18] America and they wanted to make him
[0:20] bishop of I don't know if the whole
[0:22] country of Papua New Guinea of that
[0:23] denomination or what but then the Lord
[0:25] started dealing with them and these
[0:27] people don't cry a lot they're very
[0:28] stoic kind of kind of people and he said
[0:31] the law started everything him and he
[0:33] said the Lord said to him do you want to
[0:36] you want me to be the high priest or do
[0:37] you want to be the high priest yeah he
[0:40] just he's just out of crying said Lord
[0:41] forgive me I don't want to be a bishop I
[0:43] don't want to be a high priest so he
[0:44] quit and he stayed at home for a year
[0:47] praying and then the message came his
[0:50] way
[0:51] hallelujah now this brother was
[0:53] translating for me and he said after the
[0:56] services he said he had to fight so hard
[0:58] not to start crying as the word was
[1:01] impacting him so much and after one
[1:03] service I was closing him prayer then in
[1:06] the service finishes and it's only me
[1:08] and him standing on the on the platform
[1:10] and he comes to me says did you put your
[1:11] hands on me like this
[1:13] when you're praying at the end I said no
[1:15] I didn't put my hands on you he said
[1:17] someone came and put put their hands on
[1:18] my shoulders
[1:19] and I thought it was you praying for me
[1:21] that now wasn't me Holly there's no one
[1:24] else there I mean he's very impacted
[1:27] he said manners are so powerful you see
[1:30] he never never been in meetings like
[1:32] this with him you know with the messages
[1:34] he's just so blown away by the scripture
[1:36] because I asked them I said do you know
[1:39] you're prophesied of in the Bible and
[1:41] they didn't know I said well let's go to
[1:45] roof let's go to Rahab you know let's go
[1:47] to the woman at the well and I went
[1:49] through all those let's go the book of
[1:51] Esther wait a wonderful time hallelujah
[1:53] brother could been said something to me
[1:55] we're about here on that winch they'd
[1:57] last pre-meeting us here hey and that
[1:59] came to pass exactly what you said
[2:01] Allu yeah we serve a supernatural God
[2:05] why we do amen so uh so here's most
[2:10] pretty much all the ministers that were
[2:11] there so this is the host pastor brother
[2:15] Robert pasty Maas you know so brother
[2:18] Anton here was here's the one who was
[2:22] witness to by the cop see this is this
[2:25] is brother Michael he's from so these
[2:27] are Highlanders apart from have pasty
[2:29] mas and so they're quite stoic kind of
[2:32] not a lot of emotion but we had a
[2:34] service and and I felt lead to preach on
[2:37] the seal of God in the mark of the beast
[2:39] and in that service I'm so brother
[2:42] Ronnie dear who's translating at the end
[2:45] of the service people coming forward for
[2:46] prayer we pray for everyone brother
[2:48] Michael just because he is song leading
[2:50] he just starts weeping over the pulpit
[2:52] not just crying over but just just
[2:54] weeping I'm conflate can't even close
[2:56] he's so happy and free he's can't get
[2:57] the words out he just rejoicing and hum
[3:00] and hidden brother Ronnie says now the
[3:02] service he said he said he said it was a
[3:05] bit of that service three or four
[3:07] minutes where I didn't need to translate
[3:09] everyone understood in their own
[3:11] language everyone understood in pidgin
[3:13] no I don't know when that was because I
[3:15] just you get anointed and you just off
[3:17] you go they see it was like they
[3:18] Pentecost again they were so amazed
[3:22] mister God we serve
[3:23] hallelujah they know that were blown
[3:26] away because it wasn't just him but all
[3:27] of them recognized it out because
[3:29] because brother because I was in concert
[3:31] but he said I just stood there for four
[3:32] minutes while the Lord was speaking
[3:35] hallelujah we had a glorious though
[3:37] because the thing is member you have
[3:40] mechanics but it's the dynamics you need
[3:42] and this is the age of both I mean
[3:45] there's been a quickening happened to us
[3:47] bride hallelujah so that's why he was he
[3:50] was so happy
[3:51] weeping just rejoicing he just couldn't
[3:53] control himself he's so glad and um yeah
[3:58] yes I was wonderful time so this this is
[4:03] pastor Roberts a yute now now brother ed
[4:08] this is for you okay this isn't okay so
[4:11] one one of the people he knows founded
[4:15] out of the bush and they dragged out of
[4:18] the bush
[4:18] some mechanic friends fix it up that's a
[4:21] nice issue ute with a nurse and bull
[4:24] bars and the tray on the back is from a
[4:26] Hilux and it doesn't start you got to
[4:29] push that it so so I said I'll be the
[4:32] Kiwi battery I'll help push that this
[4:33] thing and so we're driving down the road
[4:35] and there's some weird noises coming out
[4:37] the gearbox I can't describe just this
[4:39] real weird noises and also added this
[4:41] front tire was you know we thought
[4:43] madness I don't know how this thing's
[4:44] going to go but it made it and so anyway
[4:48] so he took it down to because they had
[4:49] to drive a few case down to the river
[4:52] for the people to get baptized I didn't
[4:53] go to the baptism me and pasty Moss had
[4:56] a head of town fellowship and I by the
[4:59] way brother Isaac passed a moss tells
[5:03] you if you need a cameraman for the
[5:05] movie you've got a cameraman if you need
[5:08] a black brother to play a part you've
[5:11] got one and and he'll do his own stunts
[5:14] that's what he said ok so I've got to
[5:16] pass it on to you I got a facet out of
[5:19] me create a great time anyway so it's so
[5:23] brother Robert drives this thing down to
[5:24] the baptism down to the roofer and
[5:27] coming back was much these noises were
[5:29] really really bad and I'd been dry and
[5:32] this was the Thursday the baptisms
[5:33] happened the whole week before that I
[5:35] was driving with a minute and then and
[5:37] then he said coming back to the baptism
[5:38] they said lord I need my youth to keep
[5:41] going because you know the conventions
[5:43] going on can you fix it the noises
[5:45] stopped and it's not just a little noise
[5:48] yeah and it's like this is really bad
[5:51] I'm not in the camera thought man we're
[5:53] gonna hit - right you know but stopped
[5:57] and they didn't and I was driving with
[5:59] him in it for the rest of time didn't
[6:01] come back hallelujah amen praise the
[6:06] Lord yeah so here's some of the people
[6:09] you know who coming up for prayer and
[6:12] things but the Lord I've never seen them
[6:13] respond normally they're very quiet and
[6:15] they were clapping they were excited now
[6:18] rejoicing in such of us you know such a
[6:21] Liberty you know it's such a glorious
[6:24] time yeah and you're just amazing there
[6:27] was testimonies of of you know people
[6:30] would say I'll give the test may say you
[6:31] know I can
[6:32] for prayer they didn't say who pray for
[6:34] them it didn't matter but I said yo when
[6:36] I got pray for a burden lifted this
[6:37] heaviness lifted me yeah I mean I mean I
[6:39] mean lifted from me and you know things
[6:41] like that happening so it was really
[6:43] good so this is so Christine might know
[6:48] who this is
[6:48] this is sister July from rebels brother
[6:52] Ezekiel so now he lives down in Leh
[6:55] which is four hours drive on the coast
[6:57] but he needed to get some paper work or
[7:00] education from pasty Moss from home so
[7:04] he thought so Ezekiel thought that a
[7:07] moss was going to pass you know viola
[7:10] and give it to him but he mustn't know
[7:11] I'm flying up to grow here you have to
[7:13] come up he's never been here before
[7:14] anyway he gets on a bus he was there for
[7:17] the for that service with a Lord spoke
[7:20] but that way and so he so he's not
[7:23] coming to the message yet but he's
[7:26] already started a bit of a home
[7:27] fellowship down in lay and we need a
[7:30] church to lay how loose I and he was on
[7:32] leave that one service I believe there's
[7:35] a reason he was there yeah they means
[7:38] that any 20:26 he see people come to him
[7:41] for prayer and you know they oh praise
[7:44] the Lord hallelujah now so you know how

[8:33] staying
[8:34] I'm brother Pat LV nice to meet you sake
[8:36] come down here so so so we had some
[8:38] fellowship and it was wonderful good you
[8:42] know because he was wandering here you
[8:43] know here like a lot of questions about
[8:45] things
[8:46] and and you know I said two-minute
[8:49] answered a lot of his question I said
[8:50] you know many people come out of
[8:52] denomination but the nomination doesn't
[8:53] come out of them anyway so meetings are
[8:58] done we had a wonderful time
[9:02] the people were so happy and blessed I
[9:04] see and okay and and then so I go to my
[9:09] flight I'm sitting in grow career port
[9:11] like what should have been here not just
[9:15] boarding but flying away announcement
[9:18] over the loudspeaker your flights been
[9:19] canceled so I go back to the yo get get
[9:23] retaken it I'm there for another yeah I
[9:25] mean another another night preach
[9:27] another service and I fly down to
[9:30] Moresby worth with pasty moss and we
[9:33] have more fellowship with brother petal
[9:34] and he says oh can you dedicate Joshua
[9:38] our four month old so he had a baby
[9:41] dedication he said oh this is why he
[9:42] that's why your flight was canceled he
[9:44] had to dedicate Joshua but after that
[9:47] happened and I and I and I walk them to
[9:49] the gate of the hospital I mean I mean
[9:51] of the hotel I came back to a room the
[9:53] Lord just really came down was like the
[9:54] trips done
[9:55] I had this by such a you know release
[9:58] was so wonderful but um we had um we
[10:01] hate questions and answers on the last
[10:03] the last day and four hours later I
[10:07] finished them but they asked about yo
[10:10] serpent seed all different kinds of
[10:11] things and and and the brother said now
[10:13] I understand serpent seed and now it you
[10:16] know now it's now it makes sense now
[10:18] it's clear you know just so many things
[10:20] like they see it about how you know you
[10:22] start preaching about you know how hear
[10:24] it because I covered a whole bunch of
[10:26] things yeah I show prophecy in the
[10:27] scripture down to how we should treat
[10:29] our children husbands wives everything
[10:31] and they it was just you know such a
[10:33] wonderful time they really appreciated
[10:34] it but the Lord the Lord directs
[10:36] everything you know but I'm yeah but I
[10:38] see it men and and and I said why you
[10:40] know why can't we always have
[10:41] conventions like this I said well
[10:42] conventions should get better every time
[10:44] that's why you can't compare the camp
[10:47] we're going to have to the camp we've
[10:48] had before it'll be better
[10:49] opal you know just be way way up high
[10:52] cuz that's what the Lord does so yeah
[10:54] and then also we were talking about
[10:56] okay so that surrounds all the brothers
[10:59] your sisters even who came I was talking
[11:03] to the brothers about translation work
[11:04] and a few years ago we did have some
[11:07] translation work going from or from from
[11:11] some other brothers brother Derek got a
[11:12] lot of translation work but the
[11:14] translations weren't very good so we got
[11:17] part of them to be revised by the Saints
[11:18] up and up and rebelled just a little bit
[11:21] but but not all the work that that he
[11:24] had done but thing is is 8 million
[11:26] people maybe 40% of them speak English
[11:30] maybe they can't read most of them can't
[11:33] read so having out having them and then
[11:36] also with the pidgin language it's
[11:38] evolving constantly faster than say
[11:40] English is so because it's you know as
[11:43] me to be a bridge between the local
[11:45] languages and English always mean to be
[11:47] like a bridge but anyway so we're
[11:50] talking about audio translation and and
[11:53] pasty Massa's English is excellent very
[11:56] good and so he's sitting next me on the
[11:59] plane and in any of the message book in
[12:02] his hand and was and and then their eyes
[12:05] are open and they knew him or something
[12:07] I come in what it was cool but he just
[12:09] he just written the front first page
[12:11] it's translated in pidgin to me
[12:12] perfectly fine and uh yeah I know enough
[12:16] language to actually kind of follow what
[12:17] he's saying and so he's gonna start is
[12:20] where we need to pray he's gonna start
[12:22] doing audio translation and to you know
[12:26] in your into pigeon and then the other
[12:29] brothers say brother our brother Ronnie
[12:31] wherever he is his brother only here and
[12:33] a few of the other brothers they're
[12:34] gonna be be doing the written
[12:36] translation but it's the audio I meant
[12:40] because this message has gotta go
[12:41] there's a lot of cracks and crevices in
[12:43] that country
[12:44] it's got to get there God knows were as
[12:46] bright as well would it give him
[12:47] something to work with
[12:48] I mean so so he's going to start the
[12:51] audio translation oh we need to pray for
[12:55] pastor boss and they're going to have
[12:58] meetings in rebel evangelistic meetings
[13:01] and in september and also we need to
[13:03] pray i need to go back to so you
[13:05] probably won't really go back to the
[13:07] beginning
[13:11] so brother Robert who's the pastor of
[13:13] this church he's a church planter he's
[13:16] not married never been married but he
[13:18] wants to get back in the field linking
[13:19] because that's what he's always done he
[13:21] he said he said it used to be he had
[13:23] fast and prayed the Lord would tell him
[13:24] to go to a certain place there'd be a
[13:26] revival in the church or God would start
[13:28] a church or supernaturally and so he
[13:30] feels to get back in the field so they
[13:32] from another church his his brother John
[13:34] here who he felt lead to bring his
[13:37] family to Goroka to to take over the
[13:40] church and the church and groke is happy
[13:42] about it
[13:42] other Roberts happy about it other
[13:45] John's happy about it but brother John's
[13:47] not very well he's been sick for two
[13:49] weeks since he left Shambhu he's been
[13:52] he's been in broker for two weeks and
[13:54] he's been sick and so we need to pray
[13:56] for you brother John because brother
[13:59] Robert needs to get out we I want to go
[14:02] home who wants to go home I want to go
[14:05] home amen so we may not be able to do
[14:10] much but we can pray I mean because up
[14:13] there the denominational Spirit is very
[14:15] strong and very aggressive and you know
[14:20] one day hopefully we'll get past emos
[14:22] here and and he'll share better what
[14:24] he's been through with that but as I
[14:29] said these people we will see them again
[14:35] amen
[14:36] these your brothers and sisters so
[14:40] remember the bride and Papua New Guinea
[14:41] I see to them because what are the
[14:44] questions they asked was should we um we
[14:48] as a good if the government helps us I
[14:51] said we don't need the government to
[14:54] help us it's the Lord that helps us we
[14:58] don't need to lean on yeah because other
[15:00] bands need about the Reformation it was
[15:02] the government that shielded the
[15:03] believers in that day it wasn't like the
[15:04] book of Acts I mean so they have what
[15:07] they need to get the gospel out they
[15:10] mean sure we you know feel we can
[15:12] support them but you know what I mean
[15:13] like they have the tools if God's on
[15:15] them they're equipped amen and there's
[15:18] message you'll live through them but we
[15:21] had a wonderful time thank you for your
[15:23] prayers I really
[15:24] yeah I really agree I mean I think I
[15:28] think it's all I have a me so just yeah
[15:30] pray for y'all pray for your brother's
[15:32] Amy I mean it's um maybe you want to cut
[15:44] the video but there's anyone have a
[15:45] prayer request before we go to prayer
