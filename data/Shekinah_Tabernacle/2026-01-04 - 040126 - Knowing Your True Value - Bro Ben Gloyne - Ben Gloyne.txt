[music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Good morning. Good to see you all this morning on this fine first Sunday of the new year. It's going to be a fantastic year this year. You looking forward to the year? Got some [music] big plans. Okay, this is this is what goes through. But we I was in the construction industry for a long time and we would have to price up jobs and we would go to building companies and get plans and sometimes I print them out on like was it A3 or A2? So sometimes they were massive like a roll like that and like this. And so every time we would walk into the office with these, we would always say, "Man, I've got big plans." But but yeah, but but the Lord's got big plans for you this year. He's walked into your office with some big plans. I took my moon boot off, too, if you noticed. A week early. It was I had a joke because I started off in a with a heel and it was like polyyrene and then every two weeks I could take a bit of the polyine out. So my I was sort of on high heels and I would go lower and lower and lower. So it was always my joke that I'm getting more and more sanctified as the sorry till I [laughter] ended up it was a joke. Okay. Knew I shouldn't have said that. But when [music] it was down on flats, I was actually walking on my heel the whole time and it was so painful because you can't actually the way the boots designed. So my ankle was getting worse walking on the boot. So I took it off. But I think I know my ankle's going to be my Achilles is going to be perfectly fine because when I was still in the cast, I was at the factory. I had to go there on a Friday night. I [music] could barely walk, but I had to go and help cuz they were really busy and a few people were down and I had to I was in the cast and I I went there only this one night where I could couldn't [music] really stand up for very long and I was just about to leave. I'd gone out and I just had to shoot back in and get something. And when I did, I walked through the back door of the factory and a guy was just walking past to go [music] um I think maybe use the restroom. And he is a guy I know. He's been in there two or three times. He he is a um pastor at a church in Otaki. [music] Um nice guy actually and he comes in every now and then. And &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; um then he saw me with my ankle and he asked me what was wrong and I said it was my archilles and he told me a testimony of himself. He said he tore [music] his archilles and his whole ankle was mangled up and he couldn't move. He couldn't hardly walk for years. It was just it was all twisted [music] up. Um, but he always wanted to run again, but he never could. And a a guy invited him in Paradumu to go on this sort of military running training thing. And he said, "Look, I can't run at all. I can't do anything." [music] But something came over him and he said, "I'm just, you know what? I'm just going to move forward and believe in the Lord's going to miraculously heal my ankles." So, he said he just started trying to run and he was walking. Every every step he would take, he would say, "The Lord's healed me. The Lord's healed [music] me. The Lord's healed me. The Lord's my healer." And he would then he said one day the Lord just miraculously healed his Achilles [music] and he work walks perfectly. So then and as soon as he finished the testimony then he just prayed for me there and then that my Achilles will be totally healed [music] and I'll never have any issues. It wasn't miraculously healed because I've actually enjoyed the time off the couple of months off. But I know from there that was a divine appointment. The Lord just sent this guy in to pray and then left. So I'm like I'm not worried at all about this guy. I'm planning on running a marathon this year with Shannon later in the year. I'm going to do a 42k marathon on this ankle. Let's stand this morning. Let's commit the service to the Lord. Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for your hand [snorts] upon each one of our lives, Lord, that we have such an exciting life when we serve you, Lord. There's always something new, as your word says. Your your your mercies are new every morning, Lord. There's always something fresh and new about you and about the what you're doing, Lord, and and your your plans, your purpose, Lord. You never sit around and you're never lazy. There's never just there's never a boring day with you, Lord. You you're always building up and making a new. We see the enemy, Lord, that his whole intention is just to tear down and destroy and and make things lifeless and boring, Lord, to to bring things down. But we thank you, Lord, that we can have such an exciting life with you, Lord, that you've always got great plans. And you said in your word, I know the plans that I have for you, Lord. Plans to give us an expected end, plans to bless us, plans to prosper us, Lord, and we want to surrender to your plans this year. May there not be anything in us that would [music] hinder your plan or little complexes we have, Lord, that would cause us to maybe [music] not not walk in the plan that you have, Lord. We want to we want to put those aside. May you through your spirit and through your word, Lord, break anything in our life that would hinder us this year from walking in complete victory from walking in what your perfect will is for us, Lord. And we just walk in the walk in in harmony with you. We pray. We just commit the service to your hands this morning. Just bless Brother Ben as he ministers. Thank you for a pastor, Lord.

With two or three gathered in my name, there I am in the midst. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Isaac. Thank you, musicians. Amen. Good to have everyone here today. Amen. Great to have the Milm's home. God bless you. Praise the Lord. Amen. The Node. God bless you. Great to have you. Praise the Lord. It's great to have brother Rudolph here. God bless you, sir. Welcome. Amen. Great to have you here. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we're in for a great day, I believe. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, let's turn in the scripture, shall we? We're going to go to Matthew chapter 27 and we're going to read uh verses uh 3-9 here. Amen. I trust everyone's had a good 2026 thus far. &gt;&gt; And we know every day is a good day if you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we can rejoice and just put our feet under his table and just enjoy the goodness of God today. Amen. And so Matthew 27:es 3-9, it says, "Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself and brought again the 30 pieces of silver of the chief priests and elders, saying, I have sinned, and that I have betrayed innocent blood." And they said, "What is that to us? See thou to that?" And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood." And they took counsel, and they brought uh with them the potter's field to buy uh to bury strangers in. Wherefore the field was called the field of blood unto this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, "And they took the 30 pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they, the children of Israel, did value." &gt;&gt; I want to speak about this morning knowing your true value. &gt;&gt; What are you worth? &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever's ruling your life is the value you've put on your life. Amen. So, let's bow heads in a word of prayer this morning. Amen. Just want to slip your hand up. Say, "Lord, remember me." And amen. Gracious Father, we're so thankful, Lord. You said you'd manifest yourself. &gt;&gt; Where two or three are gathered in my name, there you are in the midst, Lord. Father, you're present, Lord Jesus. We gather in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning. I pray, Father, as we have read your word. May you bless it to our hearts, anoint speaker, and hearer, dear God. May we just surrender our lives, all that we are, into your hands. Just pray you cover us in your blood this day and be glorified in our midst. Lord, touch every life, both those here and those who are streaming. Lord, we commit all things into your hands. We love you, Lord. We thank you for this opportunity to gather together in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can have your seats this morning. So, I want to speak about this value. It's such a a small word, but such an important word. Such a such a uh such an important thing. Now, here we have this painting here is of Judas and there and he's bering back and forth between himself and the and the high priest and so on on the value of Jesus. Now this is the value that they that they would put on him was 30 pieces of silver and that 30 pieces of silver was the price of a slave. So that's the value they put on the prince of life. Now everything is valued in this world whether you like to think about it or not. Even your life has a value and uh it depends whose value you believe is really uh the value you put on yourself and in the way you conduct yourself as a person. Now a value this word value means to fix that is a valuation upon by implication to revere to honor to value. So this is what that meaning you know of the word value means now value is really based on uh what you think it is uh is it's you estimation or evaluation based on a person. Now I I I hope I don't go too quickly this morning because this is very important I believe as we go into 2026. Now, we know that uh Jacob and Esau, they put a different value on the birthright, right? Jacob was willing to do everything he could to get that birthright. Esau thought it was more important to eat than get the you know, he was he he sold his birthight for a massive pottage. And the scripture says, "And thus Esau despised his birthight." I find it very interesting that, you know, it wasn't only Jacob's tent there that, you know, there was a whole encampment of people. there would have been food elsewhere. You know, he he wouldn't have been the only one cooking. But he went there and he was so willing. He he devalued his birthright so greatly that he was willing just to get some food. He had gone hunting. Maybe he was bringing back some venison and he could have cooked something, right? But he devalued it so much and he despised it. But Jacob valued it very highly. See, it depends on what you're how you're looking at something is the value you'll place upon it and especially even your own life. Now Moses, Moses and Pharaoh were looking at the children of Israel and they saw two very different values in them. They were looking at the same people in the same conditions doing the same things. But yet when Moses would uh you know when Pharaoh, let's just read this. And as Moses as a young man looked through the palace window at the slaves, he saw the same bunch of grimy, dirty, muckridden slaves that that that Pharaoh saw. And when Pharaoh looked upon them and the Egyptians, they wasn't nothing but a bunch of slaves. That's all they were good for. Just to be human mudbers and to make muddy bricks for the benefit of the cities that Pharaoh was building. That's the way Egyptians and Pharaoh looked at the slaves. So they saw a commodity. They saw less than human beings. Even, you know, Pharaoh would have taken better care of his horses than he would the children of Israel if they died. Well, who cares? Just replace another one. He didn't care about them. None. They were just a tool in his hand to build what he wanted to build. But Moses went so so that was the value Pharaoh put upon the people of God. But when Moses looked uh at the same people out the same window, he looked at something very different. Amen. You see, when he seen passing by the window, the great ditches in their faces, the tears running down their cheeks and their bent bodies. He looked upon them as the people of God. He didn't look upon them as slaves. He looked upon them as the chosen people of God. So the value that he placed on God's people was the value that God placed on his people. Cuz the scripture says that out of Egypt I've called my son. God never said out of Egypt I've called a bunch of slaves to become my children. No, they were my son. They are my son. Therefore I am calling them out. They were God's value upon the people of Israel with these are my chosen ones. I mean they're not just any people. They're my elected ones through their lineage is going to become me to the earth. Amen. They are the people I have chosen to fulfill prophecy. That's the value that he placed upon them. That they were there to fulfill God's word. And friends, if you could put the same value upon your life. I mean, you're not just here to to just be a mass of people or a number or, you know, something that's not even important. You're very important to God. That's really what I want to get to. What do you what value have you allowed to be placed upon your life? Amen. What rules you dictates the value you've allowed to be placed on your life. Okay? So Moses saw a people of great value. He saw a fulfillment of God's word, but Pharaoh just saw slaves. So it's all about the value. Now, Brother Bram tells a story. I'm just going to go through some examples of people who didn't see the value in things quickly before we just kind of transition a bit. But you see, Brother Bram tells a story of a little boy in Kentucky long ago. He said that he was went up in the attic and he was looking through all the stuff that they had in the house and you know he found a little old po postage stamp and so this boy his on his mind was ice cream. He was like Esau. He just wanted a he just wanted a quick sugar rush or something you know just to get him by. He was thinking through little boy a boy mentality. He wanted ice cream. Who likes ice cream? &gt;&gt; Some boys never grow up. But you see we all I mean most of us like ice cream, right? But that was on his mind. And so all he thought of was was ice cream. And how can he get ice cream? He found a stamp. Maybe he heard that you could trade stamps and so on. So, you know, you know, he found this little stamp. He ran down to the stamp collector and you know, he was just probably just wanting to get literally the price of one ice cream. But when the stamp collector saw it, he saw a greater value than the boy did. And so he sold it for a dollar. And that boy would have thought, man, I've really struck it big. How many ice creams could I get? You know, in those days with a dollar, you could get quite a few. And you know, so he ran off feeling very satisfied. But you see, he didn't know the right value of that stamp. And I think really if his parents knew the value of that stamp and they took it out of the attic and they put it on the mantle piece and then and then because that pl because that stamp would have been placed in the eyes of this child as a prominent piece of furniture, he would know to ask, "Mommy, daddy, why is that little bit of paper up there on the mantle piece in that frame?" And they would explain, "Well, it's because it has great value." Amen. It's a priceless thing and every day it's its value is actually going up because it gets rarer and rarer all the time. And if he knew the true value of it, amen, he would never have sold it for a dollar. And I think it's the same thing with the word of God. If we teach the value of the word to our children, to our families, we keep it as a thing that the word of God is priceless. Amen. It is the greatest treasure that can ever come into your life is the word of God. You'll hold it with great value and you won't trade it for nothing. And you won't trade yourself for nothing either if you know the value of the word of God because you're part of that word. So what happened was that stamp collector sold it and then and then then another guy sold it and then he said it's uh it's worth a quarter of a million dollars and the value would have gone up astronomically uh from then to now. You see it's a it's value. Now as I said the word value in the Bible is actually the same as the word honor. And here's a couple of uh uh times in the scripture where this word value is swapped for the word honor where in first Timothy it says honor widows that are widows indeed. Or actually you can just swap say value widows. It's exactly the same word value widows that are widows indeed. And Jesus would say for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son or value the son even as they honor the father or value the father. He that honorth not the son honorth not the father which hath sent him. So he that doesn't value the father. He that doesn't value God does not value the son places no value upon him. But they that value the son they value the father. See if you value the word it's showing that you value god. Amen. If you value the word the word is something even I think job said that his word is more important than his next meal or food. Amen. That's the value Job put upon the word of God. And I think I know I believe I'm looking at people that have placed the same value upon the word that he'd rather go without a meal than it would be the word of God. That's how important it is to you. And the church said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Right? So there's got to be a value that we've placed. But the thing is the see see Jesus knew I'm just going to jump to this quickly. See Jesus knew the value of the word. when he would tell the story of a certain man, he'd speak about the, you know, the rich man in Lazarus. He told the story of a certain man. He's speaking of that. And then now I've just put into the story here where this rich man finds himself in hell and he's looking, you know, across the chasm. He sees, you know, that poor man Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham. And you know the rich man is calling for you know you know for Abraham to send Lazarus with a bit bit of finger upon his finger to to go on his tongue to to quench you know to you know give him a bit of comfort in the flames. And then he but but then Abraham explains that there's a gulf between you and I. We can't come to you and you can't come to us. And and then and then and then the uh rich man says send Lazarus from the grave and go talk to my family. Because you know this rich man, he didn't realize the value of what they already had. He thought the value of a resurrection would save his his family, would convince them that God is true. But you see, Abraham would say, "No, if they don't hear Moses and the prophets, they'll neither be persuaded though one rise from the dead." See, it's the value of the word. See, Jesus was saying in this parable that the words they already had had so much value, it would stop them being lost. Amen. It would send them to heaven. That's the value the Lord put upon the word of God. And he put a value far greater in the word than he did the supernatural. I mean because brother Bram said it's receiving the word is the thing that has the value. And if you really get the word then the supernatural will follow the receiving of the word. I mean because the word is Jesus Christ. So you see because the thing is if if if if it was the supernatural that that would save somebody or convert somebody then Jesus would say yes I'll send you I will resurrect you and send you back but he said no the value that converts a person is actually the word it's not the supernatural otherwise when Moses took Israel out of Egypt they would have all been believers they they wouldn't have been in the desert for 40 years all 12 spies would have given the same report the same as Caleb and Joshua but you see they did not see the value of the promise of the word saying you're going to come out of Egypt and you're going into the promised land. Caleb and Joshua saw the value of it because they realize that their value is they are sons and daughters of God. Amen. But you see now what happens is people will always uh well sadly they will have the wrong value upon their lives and that value is actually given by the enemy and not by God. It says in Proverbs 11:1, "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord, but a just weight is his delight." So, a false balance gives a wrong value of what's being weighed. You see this picture, there's a there's a feather outweighing a stone. Well, that's a that's a false balance. Amen. But you see, this is what happens is see a false see false as in deceiving or fraudulent and a false balance brings a false or gives a false value. So now this is see this is what see God wants you to know your true value and Satan wants you to believe what he values you to be worth and his his his scales his balance is false. Amen. He he does not think you're really any value. The same attitude Pharaoh had towards the children of Israel in Egypt is the same attitude that Satan has towards Adam's fallen race, towards humanity. He has no value in them. just wants to use them, contain them, keep them in prison because he knows God can't lose a part of himself. He's going to fight with all he can to devalue humanity to itself. Amen. That that they will live below their privileges. And and we got to we got to recognize that Satan's done a marvelous job in devaluing humanity to itself. Done a marvelous job. People will devalue themselves to follow some movie star, someone on Tik Tok, some lust spirit, some adulterous spirit, some pride, some jealousy, some and and and and we'll come to that. But but that's the value that the devil's put upon someone and they believe that value. Friends, we're worth more than 10,000 worlds. Amen. We'll come to that later. But you see, it's such a it's such a false it's such a false balance. You know, there's a there's a false See, a false balance never shows your true value. Amen. It's like the attitude and and and there's a truth to the statement, but we must be very careful in and and in in how we how we look at it where where you know, brother Bram says the statement and then I agree with it that I'm a sinner saved by grace. Now this there is a fine line in the statement between truth and false humility because a person that says well I'm just a sinner saved by grace with the wrong attitude with a false humility makes themselves a secondass servant in the in the kingdom of God. It gives them actually a slave mentality and it actually many times gives them an excuse to remain a drunk, a gambler, a womanizer, a whoreonger, whatever it is, living all kind of lives is because they say, "Well, I'm just a sinner saved by grace." Right? That's a wrong value upon a person. We all were sinners. &gt;&gt; We all were lost. Amen. But friends, we are more than just sinners saved by grace. True, we were all born in sin. We were all born sinners. But the grace of God saved us from sin. It cleans us up. It washes us. It transforms us. And it shows us our true value. Amen. Because we're actually a child of God saved from sin by God's grace. Friends, we are we are we are more than just a number. See a wrong value as well. I'm just a sinner save. You know, I'm just a sinner. I'm just trying to get through life and you know, God's grace kind of winks at my sin and just kind of turns a blind eye. That's a false humility. There is transforming power in the word of God to deliver a person from anything. There is nothing that God can't deliver from. Save us, keep us, redeem us, wash us up. There is nothing that we cannot be saved or set free from. Amen. But you see see but the you see what happens is the value that Satan puts upon us is a wrong one. Saying we're nothing. We're just a number. I'm just one of 8 billion people upon the earth. That's the value that Satan wants to put upon you. You know, I remember working with a guy at a sure quality. Uh he was just a temp guy, but he decided that he's not going to be married. He's not going to have children because he's just a bunch of DNA running around on two legs. That's the value he let Satan put down his throat. That he wasn't he wasn't anything special. We are more than just a bunch of DNA walking around. I mean, we're more than just, you know, we're more than just a number in New Zealand. We are the apple of God's eye. We have You have great value in God's mind. Amen. Where he'd say in Psalms 116:15, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints." Amen. He cares when one falls to the ground. He cares when one dies and he cares about the people they leave behind. Amen. Because we are important to God. Jesus would say that uh are not uh are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your father knowing about it and even the hairs of your head are numbered. Who's ever tried to count your hair? I haven't. Okay, I know when to quit. I didn't even start. But you see there's [clears throat] we have multiple hair. You know, he knows every one of us. He knows every single part of us. Amen. We are not just a number in a group. We're not just a number upon this planet. We have great value in the sight of God. Amen. Our value is far above just being a church member. That's a that's a false balance. If you think, well, I'm just part of a group. You're never meant to be part of a group. I mean, you're never meant to be part of Shikina Tabernacle and just be a church member. No. God never intended you just to be that. Amen. You're living below your privilege. If you do not know God and the power of his resurrection, you're living far below your privilege. Amen. God God's value to you is far more than that. Amen. But he what what is his value upon you? Amen. Is because what does he want to do? He wants to live inside you. Amen. That his word which is God himself would step in and transform your life. Amen. Because he saw something of great value upon you that even nothing can buy it upon this earth. That's how valuable you are. Amen. It's like the word of God. Never let it be devalued to just a bunch of argument. Amen. or just a nice moral code or a bunch of ethics to live by that makes a better group of people. I say that is greatly devaluing the word of God. I mean because the word of God transforms lives. Amen. As Jesus Christ revealed God of heaven being made known. Amen. Makes us into sons and daughters of God transforming power. Amen. The word of God will rapture us. Amen. It keeps us, saves us, watches over us. Amen. Guides us. Amen. This see there is far greater value in the word than I think even we really realize. The message was not sent to make arguments. The message was sent to identify sons and daughters of God to reveal your value to you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, because even the name of Jesus as as as the angel would say to Mary in Matthew chapter 1, he says, "And you shall call his name Jesus, for he he shall save his people from his from their sins." That's the whole purpose that he came to the earth that he would save his people. Not just not just a number, but people that he had on his mind in the back part of his mind before the foundation of the world. He thought of you and he's expressed upon the earth to save you from your sins. Amen. See, see, see, that's why I say we're more than just sinners saved by grace. We are God's people saved from sin by the grace of God. Amen. See, that takes us from a servant mentality into a sunship. We got to realize we got great value. I trust everyone's with me this morning. Amen. And yeah, even even it would say in Galatians that because you are sons, God sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying, "Aba, Father." Wherefore, you're no more a servant, but a son. You're not a secondass citizen. This is the value God has placed upon your life. You're part of his family. And because you are his family, he sends forth his holy ghost. Amen. You don't become You don't become a son by the new birth. You're born again because you are a son or daughter of God. That's the value he placed upon you. You're part of God. I mean, you say and and then even Jesus would say, "All that the father has given me shall come to me." I mean, he has a collection of people on his mind. And and him that cometh to me, I'll no wise cast out. So, his his value on humanity is he's not willing that any would perish, but all would come to repentance. He cares about everybody. He's not indifferent towards humanity. He cares very much because he has great value upon human beings. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm glad about that. Aren't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Even Even like brother would preach the sermon. This probably a segue, but you know you know I'm sure we've all heard the service uh is your life worthy of the gospel? Who's heard that message? Now it's interesting in that message because many people take that take that title and they think now I have to earn something to have value in the sight of God that now my life has value that I become worthy of the gospel. Right? Isn't that what people think? What do I need to do to to become worthy or what do I need to to do to add value to my life that my life becomes worthy of the gospel? Brother never teaches it that way. That is that is not what he teaches. He goes to the he goes to the parable of the man who makes a wedding feast and invites the guests and sends out and three times and the third time, you know, he says, "Go get the Hulk blind and go to the highways and byways." And then brother Bram takes that scripture and then he says he he says that there's been an invitation to the Pentecostal feast of the word of God. Amen. There's an invitation come out. Come and dine at the master's table. Come and become one with him. Come become one with his word. But he says this world has turned down the invitation. So then therefore what makes your life worthy of the gospel is you receive his invitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. that because he saw value in you that you would receive the invitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not it's not something that you obtain to by your own human effort. No, it's not that at all. No, it's by it's by God you allowing God to come into every facet of your life, your private life, your pride, your job, your home life, your thought life, every part of your life. You let God come in and rearrange what he wants to rearrange. Amen. that you that you allow this Pentecostal feast of the word, Amen, to transform your life. Amen. That's what makes your life worthy of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, it's not something you has everyone got that clear, right? See, it's not something you humanly obtain to. It's like you No, you just receive his word and you let him change you. What are you doing? Accepting the invitation. Amen. as as he would say, but as many as received him, to him gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. What do you you receive the invitation to the Pentecostal feast and the word transforms you into a son of God. Amen. Which are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but of the nor of the will of man, but of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the outward sign. So So what is the outward sign of receiving the word? Amen. Well, it's very simple. It's like in the beginning as many as re received his word were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. I mean because what's happening is you're taking on a different name. You're changing your name from sinner or lost to Mrs. Jesus Christ. You're choosing a side. That's why well how do you become a Christian? You repent. Change your thinking. Change your mind. Amen. Say Lord I'm going to follow you. Well then then how do you express that to the world? You are baptized, buried in his name in water in the name of Jesus Christ to come forth in newness of life. So as many as received his word were baptized. It's that simple. Praise the Lord. I'm glad about that. Aren't you? You're taking his name. Now, this is very important because there's been a battle for the human soul that the value that God has um met both both God and Satan has put on the human soul. Now, I just want to um you know, this is now you can't see it. It's kind of dark in the back, but you know, I Googled what's the most valuable piece of real estate in the world. And and Mr. Google said Buckingham Palace has the greatest value. It's valued, this is in 2022. And so it's valued to be worth 1.3 billion pounds or 2.6 million New Zealand dollars. And some uh valuations place it higher to nearly 5 million US, 8.2 New Zealand billion. That's a lot of money. Now, not everyone can live in this house. You can't go buy that. Even if you had the money, you can't buy it. Now, only only certain people can live in this live in this place. That's how valuable it is. And its value is not just based on what it's built out of out of the gold that's in it. But it's but but its value is based on its cultural and historical significance to the to to Great Britain because it's the palace of the king or the queen of England. And so I when I saw this I thought isn't that interesting? A palace is the most valuable piece of real estate in the world. This is what man has put on a natural palace. I tell you what friends, what about the value that God has put on the human soul. Amen. To live there. Amen. Not everyone can live here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not everyone can live here. And the bride of Jesus Christ has incredible significance to heaven. Not just a cultural and historical impact or whatever it is. No. In the word of God, the bride of Jesus Christ is the most important thing and and thing is not the right word, but group. Amen. In existence, that's the value that God has placed upon you. Amen. You can't even put a human number on how much you're worth. Because the Lord Jesus, well, God would say in Isaiah 66, "Thus sayeth the Lord, heaven is my throne, earth is my foottool. Where is the house that ye build unto me, and where is the place of my rest?" So I made the galaxies, I made the nebulas and all the universe and all these things, but where can I rest myself? Where can I sit down and feel refreshed and let the pressure off? He's asking the question. Amen. And for all those that have made uh have mine handmade and all those things have been, sayeth the Lord, but to this man will I look. This is the place of his rest he's looking for. Even to him that is poor of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word. Now, real estate value is really based upon location and also how many people want to live there. That's why you take a three-bedroom house on Oriental Parade and you take a three-bedroom house in Hokata. They got different value, right? You may think, I'd rather live in Hokatika, but a lot of people would rather live in Oriental Parade. That's why you add another zero or two behind the Oriental Pride House than you would in Hogata cuz it has higher value based on people's evaluation of it. Now, God's evaluation of the human soul of the bride of Jesus Christ is is extremely high. You can't even put a figure on that's how high he values you. And this is where he desires to dwell. Amen. This is the place of his rest as you'd say in Psalms. A a song and psalm for the sons of Kora. Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God. In the mountain of his holiness, beautiful for situation. The joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion on the sides of the north, the city of the great king. God is known in her palaces for a refuge. Now, Zion does not just speak of Zion and Jerusalem, but it speaks of the bride of Jesus Christ. And notice it's in the sides of the north. This is where God wants to dwell. And so, because God wants it, so does Satan. He says, "I will also sit upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. I'll be like the most high." So, both Satan and God have placed a very high value on humanity because Satan knows if he can just get and dwell where God wants to dwell and stops God dwelling there, he's going to win amongst the elect ones. But I tell you what, Satan can't. He tries, but he can't do it. But that's why he tries to put all of the world under a blanket of darkness to say, "These are my property. This is this is mine. But God, we understand by election won't won't let one of his stay stay with Satan on the throne. No, he's going to evict that guy. Amen. Out of every man, woman, boy, and girl that belong to God. And God's going to dwell there cuz that's where God has purposed. I'm going to live there. That's the value that I have that that that he has placed upon the bride of Jesus Christ. See, there has to come a time when we know our value, right? Even as say in 1 Corinthians 13, for now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face now for I know in part, but then shall I know even also uh as also I am known. So there has to come a time when we know our value where we're not guessing that we are worth a certain amount or something, but we know our value in the sight of God. Cuz if you know you're worth it, man, you're not going to sell yourself for something less. You say, "No, no, I'm worth far more than this thing the devil's trying to give me." Isn't that right? You're going to you're going to actually esteem yourself. And this is not pride. You don't realize, no, I was bought with a price. It wasn't a cheap price. I wasn't in the $2 shop. I wasn't a hamburger from McDonald's. I mean, no, no, I'm a very valuable person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that right? So, see, this is this is very important that you realize because if you realize your value, why would you let something far less rule your life? Why would you let some spirit out of hell govern your life and dictate what you should do and be the king of your life? Why would you devalue yourself that low when God placed such a high price amen upon upon you? Now, there's a saying that people say, I've been thinking about this, you know, keep your eyes on Calvary and move forward. What does that mean? I'm not asking for an answer, but you I just want you to think about it. Have you actually thought about, oh, we're just we're just keeping Calvary in front of us and we're just looking at Calvary and look to Calvary. What does that mean? Does that mean that all other revelation uh is not important? Does that mean we throw out all the books of Paul and we just keep the gospels and we just keep the part where Jesus was died on Calvary? It doesn't mean that. And it what it means is it means that you've got to see what Jesus did for you and your value of what he did for you. I'm going to break that down a bit. But you see, because what happens is when you really see Calvary for what it is, then it will change your life forever because you'll see your value. You'll see what he did. You'll see what he did and you'll see what it means to you. And not just that, but it will it will show you your value because we know that day on Calvary, the Lord Jesus purchased the redemption of the whole world. He purchased our salvation in full. It's paid in full. Amen. All of our sins have been struck off. Our iniquities, our secret faults, everything was paid for that day in completeness. Amen. Our healing was paid for. It's all paid for. You know, have you ever imagine if you go to a restaurant, you say, "It's on the house. It's paid for." &gt;&gt; You kind of eat differently to when you've got to pay for it, especially if you're a bit tight. You see, you know, but if you realize it's paid for, man, you just relax. You just go enjoy. It's paid for. Why? And you you know and if you just get a little entree and you're sitting in the corner having this little thing and someone comes and looks at you and they say, "What are you doing? This is paid for, man. Why are you just eating this little thing? It's all yours. Go and enjoy it." Right? You look at the value of that banquet a bit differently. And when you realize that that day on Calvary that total deliverance was purchased for you in full, I mean, you don't have to be a part-time Christian. You can be a full-time believer. Amen. That the rapture was purchased for you. It's all paid in full. Healing was paid for. Deliverance was paid for. The peace of God was paid for. Amen. Every redemptive blessing of that God has given us was paid for that day on Calvary in full. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, it's also it's also not only that, but then you'll also see your value in that. Amen. Cuz why? It wasn't the blood of a Jew that we're redeemed by. It wasn't the blood of a Gentile. It was the blood of God that was shed. Amen. Amen. Every time someone buys something, you put a greater value of the thing you're buying than your own money. Otherwise, you wouldn't buy it. Amen. So Jesus, when he died on Calvary, he placed a greater value on you than his own life. This was the son of God. This was Emmanuel. This is the blood of Jesus Christ. This was not the blood of a Jew or Gentile. This was God's blood was shed. He paid he paid for it in full because he put greater value on you than he did himself. So if you keep now if you keep Calvary before you. Amen. What are you keeping before you? One the fact that every redemptive blessing is yours. Amen. But then another thing is that you are valuable. You are of great value. Amen. You see and what does it do? It will break you out of everything that's not of God. Amen. Brother Brown would tell the story of a of a of a young girl that had a had a heart trouble before she was healed with a physical heart condition. He tells a story that now she had a spiritual heart condition, a spiritual heart trouble. Her lover had run off and married some other woman and yet she was still in love. This boy telling that she um he was in love with her yet uh yet he said his father had caused it. Now so so his his value of her was actually just to use her for an emotional need but didn't really love her. And then so so and then um and then brother says um he said oh nonsense he didn't have to marry the other girl he did it because he failed to have the right kind of love for you. That's right. But but see being out all wound up into that the girl sat there in such a stoop like and said oh I know Johnny loves me. I know. See that's all she could see. She lived in that one little world by herself. She had formed herself in there. So, she had devalued herself because her true value was, "I'm better than that. I'm better than being being just manipulated by a boy that's run off and married someone else and living under a false pretense. I actually have so much value that I deserve to live by the truth of the situation." Amen. But then she had formed this little world and that how many people live this little world because they devalue themselves that they make their value just a just a just a doom scroller going through life doom scrolling through so social media you're far greater value than that consuming the filth that comes out of Hollywood. You're greater value than that. Amen. But you see she had formed her little self in there. She didn't see her value. And then he says, "I took the hold of her hand and said, "Listen to me." And the Lord showed a vision, you know, and she knowed, I know nothing about that something had taken place. Some transaction between them. And when that was said, then that snapped her right quick. I said, "Now, while you're out of there, look to Calvary. Look to your value. Look to what Jesus did for you." Amen. there. You're going uh you're going out here and trying to start to drink a minister's daughter, a Pentecostal minister's daughter, and doing the things you're doing, trying to drown that sorrow, that man, and so many don't even care the snap of their finger for you. I said, look, yondered to Calvary. That's the only way back. Why? Look to your true value. Look to your true value. I mean, you are far more valuable than being a drunkard. That sitting in a stouper in a little world, you're far more valuable than that to God. Amen. See, we've got to get ourselves focused to whether we live or die, single joint. It's Calvary Christ. That's the thing that God wants us to come back to. What? To look at our true value. Do you know you're valuable? &gt;&gt; In here, do you know you're valuable? Not in here. Do you know in here? Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, what did he do? Jesus the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame. That word despise means to think little of. So he thought little of the shame being stripped naked uh humiliated made fun of marred more than any other man hanging between heavens and earth on a cross. He thought little of that compared to what he thought of you. Amen. He he put the suffering he had to go through of little value compared to the value of you. Cuz there's a joy set before him which was you redeemed made in his image. him and you becoming one. That was the value he put upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're bought with a great price. &gt;&gt; We are not our own. We're bought with a great price. You have great value. Silver and gold cannot give you salvation. Nothing in h stocks and bonds, commodities, nothing can actually purchase your human soul. That's how great a value you are. It took the life of God, Amen, to be to be given. Amen. That you could receive eternal life. Now, what does this do? This this produces Now, if we realize our value that we're the children of God, it will do like it did with Jesus. Jesus knew who he was. He knew his value. Amen. He knew he was more than just a man from Nazareth. He knew he is more than just a babe born in a manger. He knew the purpose, the value that was placed upon his life as the lamb of God. So because he knew his value, it gave him a perfect faith. I'm just kind of turning this because he knew who he was. Amen. Do you know who you are this morning? You do you know your true value? That you're an attribute of God in flesh. Amen. You are the wife of Jesus Christ. You're more than a church member. You're more than just a message believer. Amen. Believe in God sent a prophet. No, you're part of the word. You're part of the eternal. Amen. You are a gene seed of God. You're part of him. And he can't lose part of himself. Amen. He knew who he was. And knowing who you are goes beyond your state and your condition. No, you're a son or a daughter of God. Once a son, always a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may go left and right like the prodal, but God will bring you back because he had to come to himself and know his true value. Amen. So what did he do? He came to himself. Came out of the pig pen. He realized my value is greater than starving feeding pigs in a strange land. My value is actually I'm a son of my father. I'm going home. But he still devalued himself to say I'm not worthy to be called a son. I'll just be a servant. But his father was not interested in him living with that false balance of living with an idea he's just a servant. No, he wanted to restore him as a full son. Not even under a a probation period of a you better you better pull your socks up and behave for 90 days then you're a son again. The father wasn't interested in that. He wanted his his child, his son to see his value back in his position in the family. And that's what God wants us to see as well, that we are not servants based on what we've done. Amen. We're not secondass citizens based on our background or the things we even did last week. That doesn't make us know we are his children. Amen. And God through the message of the hour has given a full restoration that we're joint ears with Christ. Amen. That we are part of the family of God. God never saved you to make you a servant. No, he saved you because you are his children. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So, so uh Jesus could Jesus could um he he knew who he was and that gave him perfect faith. Now, the Lord Jesus knew his value. He knew his value. And I pray that we would know as we are known that God's value he placed on you, you would know that same value. And so, Satan, Satan tried to because this is what Satan does. Satan in the wilderness when he was tempting Jesus was trying to work out what Jesus' value was because when you know a value of something you can buy it right who's ever heard a piece of artwork is priceless well I need a value even the richest person in the world if you you know if you're as rich as Elon Musk you know you you could buy Buckingham Palace you could buy whatever but if they say it's priceless you say well obviously this thing's not for sale but if you know the value of it then you can say well I'll pay I have this so I'm going to buy it So, Satan wanted dominion over our Lord Jesus. So, through those temptations, he is trying to work out what will Jesus sell himself for. What does Jesus know his value is? You see, but but but what happened is is Jesus rebuffed every attempt of the devil against them because Jesus knew who he was that he could not be bought. His value was far above being under the leadership of Satan because because what was see Satan pointed out the rocks to Jesus. If you be the son of God, turn them into bread, right? So what would he turn them into bread? He would have been following the leadership of the devil to use the gift in his life for himself. And so what does what does the devil do? Like Elvis, he sold his gift for a fleet of Cadillacs. Many other people sell a gift that God's given them. Amen. what to do because because Satan will always give you an offer like he did Jesus cuz he cuz he want Satan wants to see what value have you placed upon you cuz whatever value that you believe you are that's how you conduct yourself. Amen. Like brother Bram would tell the story of the slave slave buyer there in America before slavery was outlawed. He went to a plantation. He saw a bunch of slaves but there was one young man that was different. he can, you know, and then and then so the slave buyer was talking to the plantation owner and said, "Well, I want to buy him." But you see, the plantation owner knew the value of that slave. He said, "He's not for sale." And then so the slave buyer asked the plantation owner, "Well, what's the why is he different?" You know, does he eat different food? No, he eats the same food. Does he sleep in a different quarters? No. He's, you know, he sleeps in the same place. Is he a boss over them? No. He's just like one of them. What makes him different? And the and the plantation owner could have said he knows his value because he was a son of the king in Africa. He was a royal prince. Amen. Though he wasn't living in his kingdom and probably never could go back to his kingdom to take his father's throne, he knew his value. No matter where he was, the conditions he was in, he knew his value. So he decided because I'm royal, I have value. I'm not going to stoop down like the rest of everyone else. I'm going to conduct myself as a prince even though I'm a slave. And friends, if he could know his value, how much more you and I as the sons and daughters of Jesus Christ. Amen. That we don't need to stoop ourselves down and devalue who we are. But we can live according to our value. And this is what Jesus did. He lived according to his value. He knew he was he was priceless cuz he was the lamb of God. Amen. of Satan would come to him and try and try and get him to use his power for his own benefit. Like Elvis would sell his gift and so on. But of course he said, you know, get behind me, Satan, man shall live by bread alone, but every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. And then Satan would take him up to the top of the temple and throw himself off and well, Satan would try and get him to throw himself off, you know, twisting the scripture to make him again do something to make himself a name. And then finally, Satan took him and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and said, "If you if you bow down and worship me, I'll give you all of these." You see, this is the value. You see, Satan's value of the Lord Jesus was going up. You'll be king of the world. Just bow down. And you see what happens is Satan will put a valuation on you. If you have a very great gift, he sees a great potential in you, he'll promise you the world. You want a private jet, you want a private island, you sign this contract. You'll be a mear. Everyone will love you. All the women will flock at you and all the men and all these things and you can have whatever you want. Or he'll just give you a little kingdom. You can be cool at school, man. You can be one of the popular kids. You've always wanted to be accepted. This is what he does. He'll give you a small kingdom. Everyone will like you. Just don't be so overboard with this Christianity stuff. This message is old fat. No, no, don't worry about I'll give you this. Look what you could be. What does he do? He's putting a value and he's trying to see will you sell out for that value? Is that the value you've placed on your life just to be a cool kid or you'll be the popular guy in the office or the popular girl or whatever more? You know, you'll be you'll be that. Is that all we are? We have far more value than being the cool kid. &gt;&gt; You know, you people people get so gripped about they got to have the perfect body and the perfect hair and the perfect all they're doing is devaluing themselves to be some sex bait for someone. We have far more value than that. Or people say, "What's the use in trying and throw themselves at any boy or girl that come their way?" Believe it or not, don't devalue yourself. You got way more value than you realize. But it's the enemy trying to give you an empty promise cuz he's trying to buy you. You got to realize, no, I am I am priceless. You can't put a human you can't put a value on me because I've been bought with the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. You can't buy me. have already been bought. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't don't devalue. Let's not devalue ourselves. You know, brother Brown says the three temptations especially for a ministers money, woman, and popularity. I say those three things are a big problem. Especially popularity. This is even us people. I just want to be popular. I want to be accepted. I want to be the, you know, in with the incrowd. You know, there's one incrowd you want to be in. &gt;&gt; That's the one that's going to heaven. That's the eternal incrowd. I'd rather be accepted up there and turned down down here than the other way around. Our value is far more greater. Don't don't devalue yourself based on, you know, based on the lies of the enemy. You know, people become obsessed. Well, I just got to get the girls to chase me and that's my value. You're far more valuable than that. Or I got to get the boys to chase me. You're far more valuable than that. I've got to have the big house, the big job, the big your life is far more val, but that should not be what you place your value on or the circle of friends or the number of likes you have or any of those things. Don't be devalued to that value. We are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why that's why the Lord Jesus because he knew his value. He did not bow to any any temptation that the devil gave him cuz he knew his value. Do you know your value this morning? I trust you do. Amen. Brother says this. Now remember this. Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. But the book of Revelation shows it how the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, making it lukewarm, formal, and powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing his works, which is the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word, right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire. He fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is, what are you the purchase of his blood? Amen. Attribute of God and flesh, part of his word. Bone was bone, flesh was flesh, life is life. Amen. You're part of him. Amen. This is what you are. You're not just a church group. You're not just a Christian, if I put it that way. No, you're the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. You're you're a redeemed son or daughter of God. That's what you are. Amen. You get the revelation. I'm valuable. I'm not just some commodity. I'm not just an object that God has got a hold of. No, he loves me and respects me for who I am as a person. He puts great value on me. Like brother Am says, he God wants Christians to be happy cuz he puts great value on you. Amen. What she stands for and that she can do the greater work, she will be an invincible army. If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before her. He will be definitely thwarted today as when Christ withtood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert. Why? Because he knew who he was. So he could withstand his attacks. When we realize what we are and who we are, we can turn down every one of his temptations. Wanting to be the big shot. You're more valuable than that. I want to be the big person. No, the only big person is Jesus Christ. Amen. Yes. Satan hates revelation, but we love it. With true revelation in our lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail over them. Why? Cuz you realize you're valuable. You're more valuable than the spirit trying to tempt you to to to be led by it. No. Do you know you know an evil spirit is just a fallen angel that's been fired out of heaven. &gt;&gt; That's all it's all an evil. So a lust spirit is a fallen angel. Pride is a fallen angel, malice, strife, back, gossip. It's all Why? Why be known as a gossiper? You're devaluing yourself. Why not be a carrier of truth at edifying the body? Amen. Why? Why not be someone who's comfortable in their own skin? Jesus Jesus was very comfortable in who he was. He wasn't put out when someone tried to be greater and more and expressive. No, he knew who he was. Amen. He wasn't he would not let himself be devalued to become part of some carnal pecking order. Right? &gt;&gt; So I trust you realize that you're very valuable. &gt;&gt; Because remember, you've got a soul that's worth 10,000 worlds. You can't put a value on 10,000 worlds. They don't even know what the value of this earth is. They don't know what's in the crust terms of precious metals and different things. They don't know the value of this earth. Hey, I say you just take that into the spiritual. The world does not know the value of you. But God knows the value of this earth and and he knows the value of this earth. Right? So if my soul is worth more than 10,000 worlds, that means Jesus paid more than that when he died on Calvary. Right? And that's how valuable I am in his sight. And if that's the value he's put upon me, then therefore I'm going to conduct myself that I'm more valuable than stooping down and being devalued and being led about by the spirit of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a song and maybe No, I don't know. Well, I don't think we've ever sung it here, but here's a maybe the musicians can come just with this. This is this is my closing summary. This is from the song Worth. You thought I was worth saving, so you came and changed my life. See, he thought you were worth saving. You had value. You thought I was worth keeping. That's the value he put upon you. So you clean me up inside. You thought I was to die for. So you sacri sacrificed your life so I could be free. So I could be whole. So I could tell everyone I know. That's the value he put upon you. That you were worth saving. You are worth keeping. &gt;&gt; You are to die for. &gt;&gt; That's how valuable you are. That's the value that God has placed upon you. And if you have the revelation, I am priceless. It doesn't make you proud. Doesn't make you arrogant. It makes you truly humble that God would pay the ultimate price. Amen. For me who is priceless. &gt;&gt; And that means you're not going to stoop down and be led by a spirit of this world because I'm more valuable than them. Why would Look at this. the king of glory. You just wait, let's go back to this slide here. Wouldn't it be because because it's very simple to say, wouldn't you agree? Isn't it ridiculous for the devil to think that the Lord Jesus would follow him? &gt;&gt; Who's Satan? He's an archangel that's fallen from heaven. He has no position. &gt;&gt; He's the king of the bottomless pit. There's there's no foundation. He's got nothing to give anybody. He's got no heaven. He's got no eternal life. He's got nothing but torment and trouble. Right? Even hell's not his. It was made for him, but it's not his. Right? So, isn't it ridiculous that Satan thinks he can offer Jesus, who's the word made flesh, something &gt;&gt; that he would give himself for? We think, of course, that's ridiculous. &gt;&gt; What do you place yourself there being tempted by Satan? Don't you think it's ridiculous that the devil would try and come and try and buy the bride of Jesus Christ with a temptation when she has heaven. She's got streets of gold. She's going to overcome his throne. She's got eternal life. She's got a rapture to step into. She's got her redeemed ones coming with her. She's got her family being saved. She's got the word of God and flesh in her. She's got every divine promise. She's got a eternal body waiting in the heavens. &gt;&gt; That's ridiculous. Hey, &gt;&gt; well then next time the devil comes your way and tempts you, say, "No, I'm more valuable than that. You can't buy me, Satan. I've been bought with the blood of Jesus Christ, and I'm of great value to God." So don't let the devil ever try and devalue yourself in your own eyes. I'm nothing. I'm not important. Nobody cares. God cares. &gt;&gt; God cares. If God cares, that means the main one cares. The important man cares. If he cares that I'm cared for. If he thought of me, then I'm thought of. Amen. If he remembers me, I'm not forgotten. Amen. So, next time the devil comes your way, don't stoop down to his what he's trying to buy you with. So, no, no. I'm more I'm more valuable than this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand, shall we this morning? Let's just leave it there. Amen. But you're of great value. People of great value. &gt;&gt; I can't ensure you that's how valuable you are, but God has. Amen. With his blood. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's um you got a song? You got a song, brother Isaac? Sorry. &gt;&gt; What about it's um &gt;&gt; worthy is the &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lamb who was slain. Holy, holy is he. We [music] sing a new song to him [singing] who sits on heaven's mercy se.

Let's bow our heads, shall we? Gracious Father, may we know our true value to be a son or daughter of God. Lord, not to be led about by some evil spirit or some complex or pain or hurt. Lord, we're we're a greater value than that. I pray, Father, you truly reveal our true value to ourselves. May we know, dear God, the price that we were bought with that day on Calvary wasn't the blood of a Jew or a Gentile you shed. No, it was your own blood. the blood of God. You went with the joy set before you, Lord. You saw the value of what you were doing, Lord, to purchase us back to yourself, to redeem us by your blood. We thank you for this, Father. I pray dear God as we go out Lord after lunch and go into the week and Lord when the enemy tries to tempt us to drag us down may we realize our true value that those things are below us that Father you've you have placed such a high value on our lives that why would we devalue ourselves and be led about by the things of the world reveal this to us I pray we love you Lord we thank you for this day thank you father for how great you are your mercy and grace and oh we just love you Lord and thank you in Jesus Christ's name.
