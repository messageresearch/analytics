[15:59] the title of this song is I see a cloud
[16:09] like a man's hands
[16:11] I'm before start the song I'd like to
[16:16] take you on a little journey this
[16:17] morning to first Kings chapter 17 in
[16:21] chapter 18
[16:25] when the Lord to the ledger
[16:28] to tell a hab
[16:31] that he will withdraw rain indeed from
[16:35] the land of Samaria
[16:38] there was to be no rain there was to be
[16:41] no food in the land of Sumeria but he
[16:47] told Elijah
[16:49] to go to the brook of ferry and in the
[16:54] brook of sheriff cherith the law to
[16:57] allow you to stay in weights and the
[17:01] Lord fed him with crows and bread Amon
[17:08] and it came to pass when the brook was
[17:12] dried up the law to Elijah to go forth
[17:17] and on his way to admit a widow and
[17:23] Elijah followed the words of the Lord
[17:25] and he went on his way
[17:30] and thus he met a widow and he asked the
[17:35] waiter for some cake and a drink and the
[17:39] widow said all I have right now is for
[17:44] me and my son to eat before we die and
[17:48] Elijah said unto the woman prepare me
[17:51] the cake anyway prepare merely drink
[17:56] for you shall be blessed there shall be
[17:59] an abundance of wine pouring from your
[18:02] pot and you shall help on the bonus of
[18:04] bread and by faith should put the bread
[18:08] and cake and drink to Elisha anyway
[18:12] and Elijah told her that you shall be
[18:14] satisfied until rain comes forward until
[18:18] rain comes upon the land and it came to
[18:22] pass when the son of the widow was sick
[18:26] the Bible said that the spirit had will
[18:29] have had left the child's body the
[18:32] breath has left the child's body and
[18:34] Elijah took the child onto the mountain
[18:36] and laid the child bear on the floor and
[18:39] said O Lord the child is sick father
[18:45] pouring rain and heal this child the
[18:49] Bible said Elijah put his body on to the
[18:53] child
[18:53] three times on the third time the child
[18:57] was raised and I'd like to take the
[19:00] child to the brother and therefore the
[19:04] widow saw the glory of the Lord
[19:05] two times amen thank you Jesus and it
[19:13] came to pass when the Lord then told
[19:16] Elijah to go and tell a head that he has
[19:24] an abundance of rain that there will be
[19:27] rain on the land
[19:29] [Music]
[19:33] and Elijah went up to Mount Carmel with
[19:37] his servants and told his servant to go
[19:40] beyond TDC and look forth and the
[19:45] servant went out to the sea and he came
[19:47] back with reports and totalizer there is
[19:50] no rain there was nothing Elijah said go
[19:54] back look again the Bible said on the
[20:00] seventh time the servants came back with
[20:04] reports and the servant the servant said
[20:07] Elijah I see a cloud like a man's hand
[20:12] I lied you got up until they have jump
[20:18] on your chariot
[20:20] come down to your people and spread the
[20:24] news for the Lord will rain down
[20:29] and there I say this on the 13th to the
[20:35] 17th of December in Auckland there was

[39:10] and it shall be a sign unto you ye shall
[39:13] find the babe wrapped in swaddling
[39:14] clothes lying in a manger
[39:16] and suddenly there was worth there was
[39:18] with the angel a multitude of the
[39:20] heavenly host praising God and saying
[39:22] glory to God in the highest and on peace
[39:24] I mean sigh and on earth peace and
[39:26] goodwill towards men and it came to pass
[39:28] as the angels were gone away from them
[39:30] into heaven the Shepherd's said one to
[39:33] another let us go now even unto
[39:35] Bethlehem and see this thing which has
[39:37] come to pass which the LORD hath made
[39:39] known unto us and they came with haste
[39:41] and found Mary and Joseph and the babe
[39:43] lying in a manger
[39:44] and when they had seen it they had they
[39:47] made known abroad the saying which was
[39:49] told them concerning this child and all
[39:52] they that heard it wondered at those
[39:54] things which were told them by the
[39:56] shepherds I mean you know we know this
[39:58] is a Christmas season but we know that
[40:02] we do not worship a God of history
[40:06] well you know we're thankful to have
[40:07] this time of year to worship God even
[40:09] though we know he wasn't born in this
[40:12] time of year cuz it's winter up in the
[40:14] northern hemisphere he was born in the
[40:17] springtime but you know it's amazing
[40:18] when you know we read there in Psalms a
[40:21] hundred that you know know you that the
[40:23] Lord he is God and he has made us and we
[40:26] are and not we ourselves we are his
[40:29] people so he has made us for a purpose
[40:32] he has fashioned us by his word that we
[40:35] would manifest as
[40:36] upon the earth and we are as as we read
[40:39] in Isaiah 66 God is asking heavens my
[40:42] throne earth is my footstool so I made
[40:44] all things I made the galaxies the stars
[40:47] the moon's the all these things but
[40:49] where's the place of my rest that's
[40:50] where he's asking and I trust when we
[40:52] read that you show something in you she
[40:54] said he's talking about me Here I am
[40:56] Lord
[40:56] I'm the place of your rest your question
[40:59] has been answered wholly by my life amen
[41:02] I answer that question we say where's
[41:04] the place of my rest
[41:06] I am the place of your rest my soul amen
[41:08] because God doesn't dwell in a temple
[41:11] made with hands but he dwells in the
[41:12] human soul amen so we are the place of
[41:15] his race
[41:16] hallelujah God has been looking for a
[41:18] place to race and here we are I mean so
[41:21] now we you know it's amazing when you
[41:23] read the you know read the Gospels you
[41:25] know we see that they have repeated
[41:27] themselves in this day I mean where
[41:30] where people like the Shepherd's where
[41:33] people have received an angelic
[41:35] visitation and that visitation has
[41:38] pointed them directly to where Christ
[41:40] the word is right so because we know in
[41:42] the scripture that angel means a
[41:45] messenger and an angel is not always a
[41:48] heavenly being butter but a manner a a
[41:51] minister as an angel as well right as as
[41:54] Paul would say in Galatians 4 and 14 he
[41:58] says in my temptation which was in my
[42:00] flesh he despised not nor rejected but
[42:04] received me as an angel of God even as
[42:07] Christ Jesus so they receive Paul as an
[42:09] angel of God and he was note we know he
[42:12] was a man right so hey so a so an angel
[42:15] and the scripture is not always a
[42:16] heavenly being but it as a man as a
[42:18] messenger right so but a true angel or a
[42:22] true messenger will have a scriptural
[42:24] message from God and they will point the
[42:27] people to where God is in their day and
[42:30] God will supernaturally confirm that
[42:32] word right so you see the angels message
[42:35] they the angel told them go to Bethlehem
[42:38] you'll find the Messiah in a manger they
[42:41] heard the angels message and they
[42:44] followed the angels message and they
[42:46] found the Christ exact
[42:48] where the angel said he would be they
[42:50] would they weren't you know they didn't
[42:52] go to the manger say he's not here and
[42:54] then they went somewhere else and found
[42:55] him they found him exactly where the
[42:58] angel said right so a true angel from
[43:01] God will point the people to where
[43:04] Christ is right because we know he's not
[43:06] a babe in a manger now
[43:08] I mean he's not walking the shores of
[43:10] Galilee in his corporal body ami but he
[43:12] is his living word right the Apostle
[43:15] Paul said we don't know him after the
[43:17] flesh anymore though we have known him
[43:20] after that manner because we know him as
[43:22] his Living Word right Christ is his word
[43:26] you cannot separate the word from Jesus
[43:29] they are one hallelujah and that's why
[43:32] it's so important that we recognize he
[43:34] is his word I mean because he's not a
[43:37] God of our imagination he is his word so
[43:40] we can have confidence God you are your
[43:42] word you cannot separate yourself so if
[43:44] I stand on your word you will back up
[43:47] your word because that is you you cannot
[43:49] lie you cannot deviate your word is true
[43:51] hallelujah we can stand upon that word
[43:54] amen so now that's why it's amazing the
[43:57] angels they didn't go to the priests
[43:59] they didn't go to the temple they went
[44:01] to shepherds in the field
[44:03] amen to show the kind of people that
[44:05] will receive the message amen in their
[44:08] day
[44:09] imagine that you're your brother Brahim
[44:10] dramatized imagine the high priest going
[44:12] into a stinking stable they wouldn't go
[44:15] near the place
[44:16] oh this place is going to be swept out
[44:17] first send some servants and clean it up
[44:20] I'm not going in with her you know where
[44:22] the animals you know they poo and they
[44:24] we and they do all kinds of things
[44:25] caphis is going with his nose you
[44:29] know with a pig on his nose
[44:30] can I come in because people weren't
[44:34] humble to themselves to where Christ is
[44:36] and man doesn't change
[44:39] hallelujah so now so it's the kind of
[44:42] people that that God's in the message
[44:44] who were poor humble shepherds amen
[44:48] and now notice now the Shepherd's after
[44:51] they they saw the Christ they didn't
[44:54] just well say that was need and go back
[44:56] to their old lives they've been going to
[44:57] publish it abroad we've seen the Messiah
[45:00] I mean so they so the Angels message
[45:03] awaken them to what God was doing in the
[45:06] day it gave them a revival but it
[45:08] awakened them they weren't your ship is
[45:10] on the field anymore listen we have seen
[45:13] the Word made flesh in our day and it
[45:15] revived awaken them probably and then
[45:17] they begin to preach we have found him
[45:19] and they could say because they can say
[45:21] where is he I'll show you I'll show you
[45:24] here is cuddly and the people that heard
[45:26] his message but see the Christ in their
[45:29] day hallelujah that's a true believer I
[45:32] mean the true angel will point the field
[45:34] with crisis and the people that hear the
[45:37] word will see him and not just see him
[45:40] but become one with him hallelujah I
[45:43] mean that's why we don't you see a
[45:45] prophet in the pillar of fire I mean we
[45:47] make that pillar of fire we need Jesus
[45:49] Christ the word Halloween so we will
[45:52] just talk about him we made him amen
[45:55] that's what this works hallelujah I mean
[45:59] the wise men they saw a star in their
[46:02] day I trust when you read the scripture
[46:04] it's not just nice stories not just my
[46:06] songs but you can put yourself God says
[46:09] you're the wise man you're the shepherds
[46:11] hallelujah it goes from a story to a
[46:16] reality I trust the scripture it becomes
[46:19] a reality to you amen hallelujah
[46:25] so now the wise men they see the star in
[46:28] the east there in the east they come
[46:30] West I mean they follow the star all the
[46:32] way from where they were they knew it
[46:35] was scripture made being fulfilled
[46:39] because it says in Genesis that a star
[46:42] would rise out of Jacob hallelujah I
[46:45] mean we know Daniel was there from
[46:47] Babylon he taught all the wisdom to the
[46:50] he taught the wise men I mean and that
[46:53] was passed down so they saw the star and
[46:56] they journeyed they went east west but
[47:00] when they came to Jerusalem we won't
[47:01] read it but when they come to Jerusalem
[47:03] because being a natural people they
[47:06] thought we'll go to the headquarters
[47:07] we'll go to the headquarters of the
[47:08] church but when they went in there the
[47:11] they didn't see the star when they went
[47:13] into Jewish
[47:14] and that gone to Jerusalem may say where
[47:16] is he born King of the Jews and the
[47:18] people who should have known exactly
[47:20] what was going on with a most surprised
[47:22] people who weren't even Israel knew what
[47:24] was going on the people who knew girls
[47:26] know what do you mean what's going on
[47:28] the Kings bore what's going on we have a
[47:29] king he's here dears all of us they're
[47:31] all surprised and they even went to the
[47:33] scripture and said yes no I'm basically
[47:35] him he'll be born
[47:36] why didn't they just don't know you know
[47:38] journey to Bethlehem why didn't they
[47:40] just go no they just read it yeah that's
[47:42] happening that's happening okay and they
[47:43] stay where they are do you think they
[47:45] should have been a traffic jam going out
[47:47] of Jerusalem I mean we just taught
[47:49] movies there's too many people shouldn't
[47:51] be the mass exodus
[47:52] oh you mean messiahs born well where is
[47:54] he hallelujah so now they're all and the
[47:59] problem was is because you know if you
[48:01] take the night sky you know we go out
[48:04] here and it's all yeah you know
[48:06] sometimes it's all the stars out because
[48:09] it's all the man-made lights you can't
[48:10] see the heavens I mean buddy you just
[48:12] travel a bit or if you have a mess power
[48:14] cut you'll see the heavens as they
[48:16] really are
[48:16] but it's the man-made lights that man
[48:19] has put up blinds us from the reality of
[48:22] the heavens right so all the man-made
[48:24] lights all the religious lights in
[48:27] Jerusalem or the denominational lifes
[48:29] and Jerusalem blinded out what the
[48:31] heavens were saying and that's why they
[48:33] didn't see the stuff
[48:34] but since when they leave Jerusalem then
[48:36] they saw the star again why because the
[48:38] man-made lights of their religion
[48:40] weren't blinding in to where the Star
[48:41] Wars hallelujah and then so now the wise
[48:45] men they followed the star and they
[48:47] found the Christ right and we know from
[48:49] the scripture that there's been seven
[48:52] stars
[48:53] sent to the seven churches who are seven
[48:55] angels messages to the churches right so
[48:58] everyone that follows the star in their
[49:00] day will see Jesus Christ in the word
[49:03] right they will be led right they won't
[49:06] be lead to a man or to a system but they
[49:08] will meet Jesus Christ of living world
[49:11] in there
[49:12] Holloway that's what the father's the
[49:14] stop points you to wait probably I mean
[49:17] that's what the brother brand's message
[49:18] does he points you to Jesus Christ award
[49:21] hallelujah that's what it does
[49:23] so we've seen is star on the eighth and
[49:25] we've come to worship Him
[49:27] ever seen Christ in our day holiday I'm
[49:30] glad aren't you I'm very glad I mean so
[49:34] they so they came they gave their gifts
[49:37] and we know that you know we give our
[49:39] lives or here's my side of the word or
[49:42] we give ourselves to Holy Week we don't
[49:44] have maybe don't have gold or
[49:46] frankincense or myrrh but we're good our
[49:47] lives come live with us our God how do
[49:50] you manifest yourself through us I mean
[49:53] so those who follow the true star will
[49:56] not only see the Lord in their day but
[49:58] they'll be truly united with him so
[50:00] that's what really Christmas is all
[50:02] about deity and humanity uniting upon
[50:05] the earth right that's what Christmas is
[50:08] really about I mean I'm so glad that's
[50:11] why I love Christmas I mean so now as
[50:15] Christ was born in a manger so he must
[50:18] be born in your heart right you've got
[50:21] to recognize you're nothing but a
[50:22] stinking manger
[50:23] I mean people polish this thing up they
[50:25] you know they refine what they eat they
[50:27] have its fitness and all these things
[50:29] but in reality we're just just thinking
[50:30] major amen but I'm so glad I'm so I'd
[50:33] rather be a manger with the Messiah in
[50:36] me than the finest palace that's what I
[50:40] would rather be I mean so he must be
[50:42] birthed in your heart right but then now
[50:45] when that happens you see his word
[50:47] manifesting through you and that's what
[50:49] Christmas is all about amen so now it
[50:52] says it says in John it says and in the
[50:56] beginning was the word and the Word was
[50:58] with God and the Word was God and he
[51:01] dropped down to verse 14 and the Word
[51:03] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[51:06] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[51:08] only begotten of the Father full of
[51:10] grace and truth so the word became flesh
[51:12] right among us now we just can't put
[51:16] that back in history but the word has to
[51:18] be put in flesh today right through the
[51:20] word put our heads put on flesh
[51:22] right hallelujah so now we are living in
[51:27] a day where God as soon as people once
[51:29] again that's why we shot that's why
[51:31] we're happy that's why the word puts on
[51:33] flesh in us and it's word has manifested
[51:35] through us is because he has put on
[51:38] flesh again you say well I don't know
[51:40] about that well says in first John four
[51:42] and two it says hereby know we the
[51:45] Spirit of God every spirit that
[51:47] confesseth confesseth that Jesus Christ
[51:50] is come in flesh is of God notice the
[51:53] word is right and every spirit that
[51:55] confesseth not that Jesus has come and
[51:58] flesh is not of God and this is that
[52:01] spirit of Antichrist where are we have
[52:03] heard that it should come and even now
[52:05] already is in the world right so says
[52:08] that every spirit that confesseth that
[52:09] he is coming flesh not has come right
[52:12] everyone can point back yes he was born
[52:14] in a manger yes he died on Calvary yes
[52:17] he was back there but it is come right
[52:20] he is coming flesh
[52:22] so now as he was in the beginning so
[52:24] instead of being one man he's in a
[52:26] multi-member body his bride right he is
[52:29] coming to human flesh that's why brother
[52:31] of says this the bride coming of Jesus
[52:33] Christ right I start scary at Scripture
[52:36] right this is the bride coming right
[52:39] where God comes and steps under his
[52:40] bride to manifest this word out of her
[52:43] hallelujah I trust you can say that's me
[52:51] Amen hallelujah Amen the Holy Ghost
[52:57] States Simon and Ana right to the Christ
[52:59] and the temple amazing here comes the
[53:02] God who who gave Moses the instructions
[53:04] to build the temple he puts on flesh and
[53:07] all the priesthood must at the high
[53:08] priest misses it they all miss it but to
[53:10] see it hallelujah and it's the same
[53:13] thing I mean today the Holy Ghost will
[53:15] lead his children to meet him in this
[53:18] day I miss why it's so vital you look at
[53:21] what's leading me in this
[53:22] season I met trust us the one treating
[53:25] you hallelujah
[53:26] I mean I trust us that today aren't you
[53:29] glad I mean we could be as blind
[53:31] spiritually blind as Anna well she was
[53:33] physically blind right but we were
[53:35] spiritually blind but then he opened our
[53:37] eyes he lead us straight to where he is
[53:39] it won't laughter you maybe thought
[53:41] you're crazy but you saw I see Messiah I
[53:44] don't care I've met him it's amazing
[53:49] hallelujah I mean I'm so glad I'm so

[54:18] or something he knew who he was he knew

[57:01] I mean so don't let the camp die that's

[1:06:01] Amen now now he sees a num soon as we
[1:06:06] would see Jesus he says now I don't know
[1:06:10] what's next I'm just here all I know
[1:06:11] here's a person I'm preaching the word
[1:06:13] saying he's not dead he's alive he's
[1:06:15] alive and promised to identify himself
[1:06:18] in our flesh human flesh like he did
[1:06:20] back there he says all that God was he
[1:06:22] poured into Christ or Christ was he
[1:06:25] poured into the church watch him Christ
[1:06:27] in us now he's not just saying nice
[1:06:29] words to say well that sounds neat but
[1:06:32] he's he's saying all that God was God is
[1:06:35] the healer God is a redeemer God as a
[1:06:38] savior God as a comfort God as a guide
[1:06:41] God is an advocate God is an intercessor
[1:06:44] and we could expand on those things but
[1:06:46] all he was he poured into you he bought
[1:06:48] into Christ the spoken word that was in
[1:06:51] God a man is in Christ right and that
[1:06:54] same parish and the bride you know that
[1:06:56] Christ was is poured into you you
[1:06:58] understand we see the third pull the
[1:07:01] spoken word manifestation right we are
[1:07:04] living in the hour where that is here
[1:07:06] right the squeeze brother Graham said
[1:07:08] what has been demonstrated temporarily
[1:07:10] will come into its fullest when the
[1:07:12] squeeze comes on right but we're already
[1:07:15] being squeezed right but the power all
[1:07:17] the squeeze does is basically activate
[1:07:20] what's in you right we're not looking
[1:07:22] that's why I say it's raining we're not
[1:07:24] looking for another movie with spirit
[1:07:26] the spirits moving we're not looking for
[1:07:28] another message the message has come the
[1:07:31] shot has come well let's get the
[1:07:33] messages the shout right of first
[1:07:35] Thessalonians 4 twin are looking for
[1:07:37] nights miss
[1:07:38] there's no such silly Lake villager and
[1:07:40] now the bride
[1:07:41] the bride's ministry time only so now
[1:07:44] we're living in a day where Christ as in
[1:07:46] his people manifesting his word to this
[1:07:48] endtime hallelujah so now everything
[1:07:52] Christ was he poured into the church all
[1:07:54] that Christ was he said poured into you
[1:07:58] hallelujah that's why you say well you
[1:08:02] say well how can within what do you mean
[1:08:04] there's healing in me what he's in you
[1:08:06] people have access to healings you say
[1:08:09] well I don't know about that well if you
[1:08:11] look in the book of Acts God always
[1:08:13] works through his body right so here's
[1:08:16] his Peter goes by the gate beautiful
[1:08:19] silver and gold have our number such as
[1:08:21] I have give IV because that Jesus Christ
[1:08:24] was in him and the man who is lame was
[1:08:26] lifted up in heels because healing was
[1:08:28] in him it was paid at Calvary you
[1:08:30] understand there's an excess you know
[1:08:32] what you carry
[1:08:33] hallelujah I'm hallelujah amen
[1:08:37] gyah Peter Peter is there in Joppa he
[1:08:40] has the vision of the tent I mean I mean
[1:08:42] the sheet come down with all the unclean
[1:08:43] animals you know and and God's dealing
[1:08:46] with them about speaking to the Gentiles
[1:08:48] at same time there's two men from
[1:08:50] Cornelius house come Gentiles and and
[1:08:53] and they say Cornelius our master has
[1:08:55] had a visitation of an angel and the
[1:08:57] angel said go get you to preach to us
[1:09:00] eternal life the angel could have done
[1:09:02] it but God doesn't use angels that way
[1:09:03] God uses man right so now God sent sorry
[1:09:07] so so God told Cornelius go get Peter
[1:09:10] Peter comes into the house now eternal
[1:09:12] life's can be ministered because God
[1:09:14] work walks works through the body right
[1:09:17] just like comfort
[1:09:18] he's our comforter right he's our
[1:09:21] comforter know what happens when you
[1:09:22] feel down and a brother or sister come
[1:09:24] up next you have some fellowship we're
[1:09:26] having comfort begins to be ministered
[1:09:28] well they your old troubled someone
[1:09:30] comes on just just just just share
[1:09:32] something with your speaks peace comes
[1:09:35] right hello yeah your old band up some
[1:09:38] complex of mind metal someone comes to
[1:09:40] hear the word or something and that's
[1:09:42] broken here's a deliverer
[1:09:44] that's in the body so all he was he's
[1:09:52] poured into you now if that is the case
[1:09:57] this is so the bride is the mechanics
[1:10:00] and the Holy Ghost is the dynamics I
[1:10:03] mean so now he says so just like a car
[1:10:06] brother MCS in the rising of the Sun
[1:10:08] it's like you take two Cadillacs they
[1:10:09] can be just off the assembly line
[1:10:10] perfectly built everything's fine but
[1:10:13] one doesn't have a spark plug the other
[1:10:14] there's a spark locus it's just that
[1:10:16] little piece that fires that little
[1:10:18] spark will actually prove well that
[1:10:20] Cadillac can do I mean both drivers can
[1:10:23] boast look at this it's got this
[1:10:24] horsepower v8 whatever ID it you know
[1:10:26] all those different things
[1:10:27] amen and be with me just be number of
[1:10:30] doors in color but and then everything
[1:10:33] else is to dick Nicole but anyway you
[1:10:35] know they could say all those things but
[1:10:36] the one that has a spark plug that is
[1:10:38] the one that can prove what's in the
[1:10:40] tank can actually go right it just takes
[1:10:42] that little spark that spark plug to be
[1:10:45] turned on in your life the Holy Ghost to
[1:10:46] be ignited and then now what's in you
[1:10:49] the word in you will prove itself I mean
[1:10:51] cause like the gasoline the words are
[1:10:53] guessing the Holy Spirit ignites the
[1:10:54] word and makes it live hallelujah so the
[1:10:57] bride is the mechanics and the Holy
[1:10:59] Ghost is the dynamics he says now he
[1:11:02] says the only thing he can do is wash it
[1:11:04] out see if it's wide enough he can sew
[1:11:07] it speaking of a doctor but God has to
[1:11:09] heal it see nature has to develop cells
[1:11:12] life life has to put that together the
[1:11:15] body has to produce calcium so forth and
[1:11:17] has life itself calcium or an heal it's
[1:11:20] life see there's not there's no medicine
[1:11:22] that heals medicine only cleans while
[1:11:24] God heal see there's no medicine hills
[1:11:27] if I cut my hand and fall dead here and
[1:11:29] you take me to the doctor say would you
[1:11:31] heal this man he'd say way he's dead all
[1:11:33] right then you say well let's sew it up
[1:11:34] and you've got some medicine that heals
[1:11:36] at hand haven't you he says no we
[1:11:38] haven't see if they saw me up and give
[1:11:41] me embalming fluid and that make me look
[1:11:44] natural for a hundred years and give me
[1:11:46] a shot of penicillin every day and put
[1:11:48] on some self
[1:11:49] seven that place certainly will not heal
[1:11:51] why because that life has gone out of it
[1:11:54] why then which is the healer medicine or
[1:11:56] life now you tell me what life is and
[1:11:59] I'll tell you who God is he God is life
[1:12:02] see we have so much on the mechanics and
[1:12:05] not the dynamics now my body is the
[1:12:07] mechanics but my body will operate with
[1:12:10] the dynamics the spirit see the
[1:12:12] mechanics don't run the church
[1:12:14] it's the dynamics the Holy Ghost that
[1:12:17] gets into this word not a seminary that
[1:12:21] teaches you all the theology and Greek
[1:12:22] interpretations but it's the dynamics of
[1:12:25] the Holy Ghost in there to sit there to
[1:12:27] fire and to bring it to pass and to make
[1:12:30] it live just exactly what the promise
[1:12:32] word of this hour not mechanics the
[1:12:35] dynamics it takes the mechanics and
[1:12:37] dynamics the word and the spirit they
[1:12:40] are they are the one that gives life
[1:12:42] amen what God promised for the hour look
[1:12:46] for it to be fulfilled you must look to
[1:12:48] him because he is the word and the only
[1:12:50] way you can look to the word is look to
[1:12:52] him look to him he is the word and the
[1:12:55] word promised for this day is to be
[1:12:56] fulfilled this day Noah's time could not
[1:12:59] be filled this day was only a type Moses
[1:13:01] time so forth but this is the day that
[1:13:03] God has promised these things that we're
[1:13:05] enjoying these things we're now seeing
[1:13:07] that the world that the world's laughing
[1:13:10] at this great monumentous power of the
[1:13:13] Holy Spirit that can change your
[1:13:14] sinner's heart they can take a look warm
[1:13:16] church member and give him a testimony
[1:13:18] that'll set the church afire from where
[1:13:21] he came out of it's the dynamic that got
[1:13:23] into the word hallelujah now we are
[1:13:29] living in an hour where this this has
[1:13:32] become flesh every part of it right and
[1:13:35] we've gone from now as brother Brahim
[1:13:37] said oh I think it's in I think it's in
[1:13:39] what's on the attraction of the mountain
[1:13:40] it's gone from the Prophet to the
[1:13:43] prophecy right so we're not just
[1:13:45] standing here declaring Malachi for
[1:13:47] Malachi for Malachi 4 but no What did he
[1:13:49] say because the word he preached open
[1:13:52] the scripture to us yep so now it's gone
[1:13:54] from the Prophet to the prophecy I'm not
[1:13:56] caught up with William Branham I'm
[1:13:58] caught up with Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:14:00] the word
[1:14:01] Rebecca didn't fall in love with Eleazar
[1:14:03] she fell in love with Isaac right that
[1:14:06] was the main thing and that was
[1:14:07] eleazar's mission it wasn't that Rebecca
[1:14:09] would fall in love with him at that
[1:14:11] though that he would tell Rebecca enough
[1:14:13] about Isaac that they fell in love as
[1:14:15] soon as I saw each other right and
[1:14:16] they're saying they're with brother C's
[1:14:18] I'm not the I'm not the one he's the one
[1:14:20] but he's the one you should follow and
[1:14:21] fall in love with right and he is the
[1:14:23] word hallelujah now now we've come to a
[1:14:26] time with a bride has taken shape right
[1:14:29] there's a mature group of people upon
[1:14:32] the earth even even we may be young and
[1:14:35] age but there's a quick short work it's
[1:14:36] happening it's already happening right
[1:14:39] so now brother Graham says in spoken
[1:14:41] word is the original seat he says now
[1:14:43] the law of reproduction bring forth
[1:14:45] after its kind Genesis 111 says that
[1:14:47] every seed bring forth after its kind
[1:14:49] these last days true church bride comes
[1:14:53] to the headstone will be the super
[1:14:55] church a super race as they near the
[1:14:58] great headstone there will be so much
[1:15:00] like him even they will be in his very
[1:15:03] image in order to be united with him
[1:15:05] they will be one they will be the very
[1:15:08] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:15:10] God amen and I wanted to declare to you
[1:15:13] that's here right we're not looking off
[1:15:16] in the future we have to stop looking
[1:15:18] way off in the future and realize what
[1:15:20] God has done in us now right that he has
[1:15:24] United he is molded and shaped us that
[1:15:27] we met him Amen that his nature we
[1:15:30] received that nature right that the
[1:15:32] nature we're born with us burned out by

[1:15:49] in the air his spirits upon the earth
[1:15:51] now his word is here right but we're
[1:15:53] going to physically meet him in the air

[1:16:20] what if he doesn't come this year he'll
[1:16:21] come next year what about the next year
[1:16:23] worried he'll come the he's coming for
[1:16:25] me amen though his coming may seem to be
[1:16:29] delayed he's right on time
[1:16:30] he knows exactly I mean that's why we
[1:16:34] got a we need some missionary zeal right
[1:16:38] because we ain't going to the last ones
[1:16:40] in right the the gospel ship is not
[1:16:43] leaving harbor until everyone's in the
[1:16:45] boat right so and and and what we need
[1:16:49] is not necessary just miss Raziel for
[1:16:50] the jungles but the suburbs right this
[1:16:53] part we're in this father video can we
[1:16:55] need a missionaries you're the push of
[1:16:57] us well I'm in the hate they could be
[1:16:59] right there they could be right there
[1:17:02] hallelujah let's find that they could be
[1:17:04] at your school they could be in
[1:17:05] university wherever maybe they could be
[1:17:07] right next to you I want to go home why
[1:17:11] you witnessing it's actually all for me
[1:17:13] I want to go home that's a bit selfish
[1:17:17] no I go home I'm done can we go now you
[1:17:21] know well if our jobs not done we're
[1:17:24] staying here amen God has done you don't
[1:17:27] understand we saw our God will do it God
[1:17:29] uses men his plan has always been tied
[1:17:32] into men right he'll get it done but he
[1:17:35] needs willing vessels to get it done
[1:17:37] right so God God didn't you know he
[1:17:39] could have had the wind preach the
[1:17:41] gospel the night you know you know a dog
[1:17:43] would come up and preach the gospel to
[1:17:44] you God could do it that way but God
[1:17:46] uses men so we said we better say Lord
[1:17:50] were available
[1:17:52] hallelujah whatever whatever we call to
[1:17:55] do oh Lord I want to know
[1:17:57] Amen so they would become the very
[1:17:59] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:18:01] God hallelujah so now we are not the
[1:18:04] manifestation of a church or a Creed's
[1:18:07] of man or denomination but know the word
[1:18:10] of the Living God amen that when people
[1:18:12] see you they should see this they should
[1:18:14] see this manifesto I mean so the
[1:18:16] character of Christ you read about
[1:18:18] should be in you his nature should be a
[1:18:21] how he dealt with things you should deal
[1:18:23] the same way because it's him living
[1:18:24] mimic Christianity is not you it's him
[1:18:27] being the Christian he is the Christian
[1:18:29] in you that's how you become a Christian
[1:18:31] you don't mind sup well I'm going to
[1:18:33] turn a new leaf I'm going to start again
[1:18:34] no you just give yourself and say Lord
[1:18:37] take this thing imma failing to begin
[1:18:39] with who realizes they were friendly to
[1:18:41] begin with it's a great victory when you
[1:18:43] realize I was born a failure and if I
[1:18:45] say this way I'll die a failure but if I
[1:18:47] give myself to you Lord I will not be a
[1:18:49] failure because you are the one who is
[1:18:51] victorious in me that's what we need to
[1:18:54] be we can't do it our own strength
[1:18:56] what doesn't want us to do an iron
[1:18:58] strength you know if you think about it
[1:19:02] and there's that Christian you know
[1:19:03] you're a lot of Christianity is today
[1:19:05] they're thinking they're gonna go to the
[1:19:07] great white I mean you know you're

[1:19:10] Lord's gonna say you did so well and I
[1:19:13] said yeah I did do well I did very well
[1:19:15] I was devout I listened this much and
[1:19:17] read this much and prayed this much and
[1:19:19] witness this much and I didn't know this

[1:19:22] gonna be worship right Lord you caused
[1:19:25] me to come here well you quicken me and

[1:19:42] hallelujah

[1:19:46] that's how it's gonna be
[1:19:48] well how did you get here I don't know
[1:19:50] we were gonna be the table how did you
[1:19:51] get here I just say you see him he said
[1:19:54] I was gonna be here
[1:19:55] that's why I'm here I was invited I said
[1:19:59] yes Amen so now he is he is the one
[1:20:03] who's living through us right so now
[1:20:06] we've come to a time and we are at that
[1:20:09] time yo this is the news this is current
[1:20:14] events the bride has become the word
[1:20:17] right the bride has become the word the
[1:20:20] bride is a living Bible but it's not in
[1:20:23] part it's in fullness right Luther had
[1:20:26] it in part the just shall live by faith
[1:20:27] just a little bit of word and they
[1:20:29] manifested that word in that day and as
[1:20:31] the Reformation continued the word got
[1:20:32] greater then Wesley came
[1:20:34] with justification the just shall live
[1:20:36] by faith in sanctification it was more
[1:20:38] the word they were just manifesting that
[1:20:40] then the Pentecostals with the gifts God
[1:20:42] just adds but now it's not just some
[1:20:44] part it's in fullness in you right we
[1:20:47] don't just manifest part of the word the
[1:20:49] whole word the whole word you understand
[1:20:52] we're not just part of it we're all of
[1:20:53] it
[1:20:54] amen that's what this message has come
[1:20:56] to do to birth a bride into
[1:20:58] manifestation amen brother Bram says and
[1:21:01] scene is not here with the shock and if
[1:21:02] you want to listen to a message go
[1:21:04] listen to that one a few times when a
[1:21:07] shock comes forth out of the grain of
[1:21:09] wheat or wheat or a blade of wheat now
[1:21:12] he's talking about how how how a wheat
[1:21:14] plant grows right so after the pollen
[1:21:17] has fallen in there the second stage it
[1:21:19] produces the third stage this shook
[1:21:21] which is now if you're not real close
[1:21:24] observer you'll never be able to tell
[1:21:26] what that is in the real grain of wheat
[1:21:29] in this of the shook as as over the
[1:21:31] grain right but as the grain grows the
[1:21:33] shook opens up and then the grain comes
[1:21:35] out and then the Sun is directly on the
[1:21:37] grain okay but the shook looks very much
[1:21:40] like the grain because it's a it's a
[1:21:42] protection right when that first little
[1:21:44] grain comes forth it looks like a grain
[1:21:47] but you sit down and open it up you'll
[1:21:49] find there's no grain at all it's only a
[1:21:50] shook a carrier of the grain
[1:21:52] now the grain comes forth from that but
[1:21:55] remember there's no more after that
[1:21:57] shock remember there's no more seed
[1:21:59] promised through a woman anywhere after
[1:22:01] Mary so we had Hagar before this male
[1:22:04] sarah brought forth isaac more like the
[1:22:07] promise then Mary brought forth Christ
[1:22:09] right and he was the promise but Mary
[1:22:12] just carried the promise right and so
[1:22:15] now as God has brought forth a
[1:22:16] restoration been the same way right so
[1:22:19] we had Luther just shall live by faith a
[1:22:21] bit of the promise but didn't look like
[1:22:23] didn't look like the book of Acts right
[1:22:25] and then Wesley came more like the
[1:22:27] promise but didn't look like the book of
[1:22:28] Acts but looked more like it than Luther
[1:22:30] right and then the Pentecostals came
[1:22:32] with the restoration of the gifts it
[1:22:33] looked more like the promise then
[1:22:35] where's the or Luther but it wasn't the
[1:22:37] promise right and then that's why the
[1:22:39] word has to come forth right and there's
[1:22:41] no more denominations
[1:22:42] promised after Pentecost we're not a
[1:22:44] denomination we are not Shakur Turan
[1:22:47] we're not divided
[1:22:48] we're not just cabbage doubt on one idea
[1:22:50] we've got the whole promise right and
[1:22:52] we're walking forward we're not here to
[1:22:54] make kingdoms upon the earth where that
[1:22:57] you know the whole purpose of having a
[1:22:58] church is people would be birthed into
[1:23:00] the kingdom built up into the statue of
[1:23:02] a perfect man that we could take
[1:23:03] eruptions that each individual would be
[1:23:06] the living would be the living
[1:23:08] Tabernacle living God's dwelling place
[1:23:10] and there's no more denominations after
[1:23:12] Pentecost it's the rapturing bride
[1:23:14] coming forth from me of the seed the
[1:23:16] word made manifest again this is where
[1:23:20] we are so we've come to that stage we
[1:23:22] were no longer just carriers of the life
[1:23:23] but we are that life the bride becomes
[1:23:26] the word hallelujah now what is the
[1:23:30] greatest you say well if we the word now
[1:23:32] what's the greatest miracle that Jesus
[1:23:34] did was it raising the dead coming the
[1:23:36] storm cursing the fig tree feeding the
[1:23:39] thousands no those are all incredible
[1:23:41] things raising Lazarus incredible but to
[1:23:44] me the greatest the greatest miracle he
[1:23:46] did is when he went to get cemani he
[1:23:48] subjected his flesh to the word he had
[1:23:51] to fulfill but he said not my will but
[1:23:54] thy will be done and he went to Calvary
[1:23:57] as a man he knew what he had to do right
[1:24:00] he knew for this cause I've come to the
[1:24:02] world he knew he was the Lamb of God
[1:24:03] take away the sin of the world he knew
[1:24:05] what he had to fulfill rights but he
[1:24:07] subjected his own flesh to the word that
[1:24:10] was for him that is such a great miracle
[1:24:13] I mean where where where a man he was a
[1:24:16] man like us right he wasn't born in sin
[1:24:19] but he's still a man like us right and
[1:24:22] so but so the greatest miracle to me is
[1:24:24] that he subjected his flesh to the word
[1:24:26] allotted to him right and now if the
[1:24:29] bride has become the word she will do
[1:24:32] the same thing now we're going to take a
[1:24:36] a quarter-turn I've really set you up
[1:24:39] for I'm going to talk about now
[1:24:42] okay now let's go to Ephesians chapter 5
[1:24:48] hallelujah a man who loves the Lord this
[1:24:55] morning so in Galatians 5 I'll read from
[1:25:00] verse 29 oh sorry Ephesians Ephesians 5
[1:25:08] 29 the Apostle Paul so he speaking of
[1:25:15] the husband and wife we're just going to
[1:25:17] take the last part of it I mean say I
[1:25:20] mean if you there I mean for no man so
[1:25:24] this is verse 29 of Ephesians 5 for no
[1:25:26] man ever yet hated his own flesh but
[1:25:30] nourishes and cherishes it even as the
[1:25:33] Lord the church for we are members of
[1:25:36] his body of his flesh and of his bones
[1:25:40] for this cause shall a man leave his
[1:25:42] father and mother and shall be joined
[1:25:44] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[1:25:47] flesh this is a great mystery but I
[1:25:50] speak concerning Christ in the church
[1:25:52] nevertheless there every one of you in
[1:25:54] particular so love his wife even as as
[1:25:57] himself and the wife see that she
[1:25:59] reverence her husband now he's speaking
[1:26:04] he says this is a great mystery that's
[1:26:07] been revealed in this day when he says
[1:26:10] that men and woman become one flesh
[1:26:12] they're actually one being right and
[1:26:14] he's saying now just as Christ and the
[1:26:16] churches saw as husband and wife so now
[1:26:19] if that's the case then husbands us
[1:26:22] husbands are actually like God to our
[1:26:25] family in that way we're the head of the
[1:26:27] family right right and and the wives are
[1:26:31] the same as the bride - to Christ now we
[1:26:35] know the Lord he proves himself so our
[1:26:39] Lord Jesus he's a man of stability right
[1:26:42] he's not an unstable God he doesn't go
[1:26:46] off on temper temper tantrums doesn't
[1:26:48] just run off you know throw hissy fit
[1:26:50] and throw us all in the trash can
[1:26:52] he is a man of stability
[1:26:55] right because he has an in goal in mind
[1:26:57] and that in goal is of people made in
[1:27:00] His image and he's very determined he's
[1:27:02] wide minded
[1:27:03] hallelujah he's made up his mind and
[1:27:06] that's it he doesn't change his thoughts
[1:27:07] he cannot God God can have not another
[1:27:10] thought
[1:27:10] he's already expressed it in his word
[1:27:12] right so he never so he's a man of
[1:27:15] stability right and so so if you take
[1:27:18] our Lord Jesus now he has so God doesn't
[1:27:23] just say he loves us he proves it right
[1:27:27] he proved it on Calvary there was the
[1:27:29] greatest manifestation of his love as
[1:27:31] when he hung between heavens and earth
[1:27:33] for you for God so loved the world that
[1:27:35] He gave His only begotten Son that
[1:27:37] whosoever would believe in him should
[1:27:38] not perish but have everlasting life
[1:27:39] right so it's not just a word but it
[1:27:42] became manifest right so he proved that
[1:27:45] he loved us right and he proved he loved
[1:27:48] us in this day by sending Malachi 4
[1:27:50] before the grain dreadful day of the
[1:27:51] Lord hallelujah so now he doesn't just
[1:27:54] say he loves us but he proves it right
[1:27:56] the Lord Jesus himself proves that he is
[1:28:00] faithful and true right I trust when I
[1:28:03] say these things you say yes he has so
[1:28:05] maybe your mind will go back he was
[1:28:06] faithful here who is faithful here he
[1:28:08] kept me here Amen right so he proves
[1:28:11] himself to be faithful and true it's not
[1:28:12] just idle words it's a reality he proves
[1:28:15] himself over and over and over and over
[1:28:18] again right that he is faithful and true
[1:28:20] hallelujah to you right Amen that when
[1:28:25] you're in a spot so and and he does this
[1:28:27] that when you come to a spot in your
[1:28:29] walk and there'll be many where you do
[1:28:31] not understand what's going on right and
[1:28:34] you don't seem to know the answer you
[1:28:37] know that he still abides faithful even
[1:28:39] when he doesn't answer you even when you
[1:28:42] do not understand what's going on
[1:28:44] you know he is in control you know that
[1:28:47] he is there with you because he has
[1:28:49] already proved himself faithful and he
[1:28:51] does not change so if he is faithful to
[1:28:54] you a year ago he's still faithful today
[1:28:56] right if he's still true a year ago he's
[1:28:58] still true today because he is faithful
[1:29:00] and true hallelujah right so doesn't
[1:29:03] matter what happens we know because he's
[1:29:05] proved himself I'm trying to bring up
[1:29:07] in here no thanks not just idle words he
[1:29:10] proves himself faithful and truth that
[1:29:12] we know when he seems like he's distant
[1:29:14] he's present and he is working and we
[1:29:17] can rest knowing that he has our best
[1:29:19] interest in mind even though we do not
[1:29:21] understand what's going on
[1:29:23] hallelujah he says and Susan doesn't
[1:29:27] convinced and concerned well the baby
[1:29:30] says don't you believe that the same
[1:29:31] Jesus that was raised up from the grave
[1:29:33] has come back in the form of the Holy
[1:29:34] Ghost and is in us now a little while
[1:29:37] the world seeth me no more yet you shall
[1:29:39] see me you shall see me for I'll be with
[1:29:41] you even in you see to the end of the
[1:29:43] consummation to the end of the world
[1:29:45] I'll be right with you I'll never leave
[1:29:47] thee nor forsake thee lo I am with you
[1:29:49] always even to the end of the world see
[1:29:51] the world doesn't see it but you shall
[1:29:53] see it the world doesn't believe it I
[1:29:55] mean the ones that believes it as the
[1:29:57] ones that receives it he says that as
[1:29:59] true it says in Hebrews 13:5 and Six's
[1:30:02] let your conversation be without
[1:30:03] covetousness and be content with such
[1:30:05] things as you have for he hath said I
[1:30:08] will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[1:30:10] so that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[1:30:13] helper
[1:30:14] I will not fear what man shall do unto
[1:30:16] me why because we know he is he'll never
[1:30:19] leave me not nor forsake me hallelujah
[1:30:22] so he never just runs off in a huff and
[1:30:25] abandons us for no reason he's not that
[1:30:28] kind of husband he doesn't just go off
[1:30:30] in a huff I'm sick of what you're doing
[1:30:32] and he just goes off right he stays
[1:30:35] faithful even if we do not abide
[1:30:38] faithful he stays faithful and
[1:30:41] revelations 19 we're just going to read
[1:30:43] a bit if you don't mind revelations 19
[1:30:44] 11 and this is when I saw heaven opened
[1:30:47] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:30:49] upon him was called faithful and true
[1:30:51] holy that's our Lord riding forth and in
[1:30:55] righteousness he doth judge and make war
[1:30:57] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[1:31:00] his head was many crowns for his name it
[1:31:02] was written that no man knew but he
[1:31:03] himself and he was clothed with a
[1:31:05] vesture dipped in blood and his name is
[1:31:07] called the Word of God and the armies
[1:31:10] which are in heaven followed him upon
[1:31:11] white horses clothed in fine linen clean
[1:31:13] and white holy so he's Here I am
[1:31:16] faithful and true I'm coming forth to
[1:31:18] conquer
[1:31:19] hallelujah amen now God is God is love
[1:31:23] we we know but that love is divine love
[1:31:26] is not human love human love is
[1:31:29] conditional right
[1:31:31] if basically if you're good to me I'll
[1:31:33] be good to you that's human love it's
[1:31:36] based on how you treat me as if I'll
[1:31:38] love you in return that's human love
[1:31:40] right but God does not pray that way
[1:31:42] God's love is not based on condition
[1:31:45] right it's not based on you it's he
[1:31:49] doesn't when he loves he's not looking
[1:31:51] for what he'll get back he just loves
[1:31:52] right it's not a it's not he's not
[1:31:55] looking for it to be reciprocated he
[1:31:57] says I love you anyway because that's
[1:31:59] how I love right but humans love based
[1:32:02] on how they're how its reacted to right
[1:32:05] so divine love is unconditional it's not
[1:32:08] based on how you're treated and returned
[1:32:10] it doesn't matter if it's thrown back
[1:32:12] completely in your face right now I'm
[1:32:15] saying these things is because if we're
[1:32:16] made in His image this is this is where
[1:32:18] the rubbers on the road if we're made in
[1:32:21] His image
[1:32:21] if the brightest kind of full
[1:32:23] manifestation you know then as he was we
[1:32:25] will be right so now if he is divine
[1:32:28] love then that divine love is enough
[1:32:31] hallelujah amen his nature's in us
[1:32:34] everything he has we become by his grace
[1:32:36] right so now if that is the case then
[1:32:39] how we treat each other will be based on
[1:32:41] divine love right so in other words it
[1:32:45] doesn't matter how you treat me I'm
[1:32:47] gonna love you anyway
[1:32:48] right and it's not going to be a fake
[1:32:51] love where I'll hold a grudge right
[1:32:55] because that's still human love he said
[1:32:57] I'll treat them anyway but I but I
[1:32:58] resent them in my heart that's not
[1:33:00] divine love because Jesus is on Calvary
[1:33:02] said Father forgive them they don't know
[1:33:03] what they do he didn't hold a grudge
[1:33:06] holy to be like Jesus grudge free
[1:33:10] hallelujah Amen to know so now if that
[1:33:15] is the case so now as so as as husbands
[1:33:19] and what you're as families we should
[1:33:20] love each other not based on what they
[1:33:23] do right but based on what the Lord has
[1:33:26] done for us that's how we should treat
[1:33:28] each other because if he loved me and
[1:33:30] redeem me and save me right
[1:33:32] you know when you
[1:33:33] first meet him you just love everybody
[1:33:34] you know that time that's how we should
[1:33:38] be irrespective of how people treat us
[1:33:41] you say well it's hard I'm in this thing
[1:33:43] yeah but he gave us overcoming power I
[1:33:45] mean so it can be done because Jesus did
[1:33:48] it
[1:33:49] hallelujah that's how we should build
[1:33:51] their confidence Jesus rose from the
[1:33:53] grave the Saints are gonna race father
[1:33:55] did came back to life it's been done
[1:33:57] Jesus did it it can be done
[1:34:00] hallelujah so now it says in 1st Peter
[1:34:03] chapter 2 let's just go here a little
[1:34:05] bit it's got a first Peter 2
[1:34:21] amen say say Amen when you're there not
[1:34:25] when you're neighbors there when you're
[1:34:26] the first Peter - we're gonna read from
[1:34:30] the last last part of the chapter so
[1:34:31] first Peter 2 in 23 gonna read down so
[1:34:36] when he was when he was reviled reviled
[1:34:40] not again when he suffered he threatened
[1:34:42] not but committed himself to him that
[1:34:44] judgeth righteously who has own self
[1:34:48] bare our sins in his own body on the
[1:34:50] tree that we being dead to sins should
[1:34:52] live unto righteousness by whose stripes
[1:34:55] we were healed for ye were as sheep gone
[1:34:58] astray but now returned unto the
[1:35:01] Shepherd and Bishop of your souls so
[1:35:04] look so so so so notice how he operated
[1:35:06] when he was reviled he reviled not again
[1:35:09] when he suffered he threatened not but
[1:35:11] he committed himself to him that judgeth
[1:35:14] Slee right so that so so this is how he
[1:35:17] was now let's go to the next let's go to
[1:35:19] the next chapter
[1:35:20] likewise he wives so now he's going to
[1:35:23] what Peter's just written he's gonna
[1:35:25] he's gonna bring it down home he says
[1:35:27] likewise so that means in like manner as
[1:35:29] you've just read so shall you be right
[1:35:32] ye wives be in subjection to your own
[1:35:34] husbands that if any obey not the word
[1:35:36] they also may be without the would be
[1:35:39] won by the conversation of the wives now
[1:35:42] that were conversation means manner of
[1:35:44] life behavior it's right so as Jesus was
[1:35:47] here he was revolved revolved not again
[1:35:49] right when he suffered he threatened not
[1:35:51] but committed himself to him that
[1:35:53] judgeth righteously likewise he
[1:35:55] following me likewise this is how wife
[1:35:58] should be amen
[1:36:00] this is how wife should be I mean that
[1:36:02] that doesn't matter how they treated I
[1:36:04] mean doesn't matter how they treated by
[1:36:06] their spouse they can love with the love
[1:36:08] of God and be exactly like Jesus was you
[1:36:12] following me I'm gonna come back to
[1:36:14] husbands suta don't worry Haven but they
[1:36:18] see this is how it should be but he
[1:36:20] because he the reason he did this is he
[1:36:22] committed himself to him that judgeth
[1:36:24] righteously so if your life is committed
[1:36:26] to the Lord it doesn't matter how you're
[1:36:28] treated right because you've committed
[1:36:30] yourself to him and nothing happens
[1:36:33] without him allowing it anyway right Joe
[1:36:36] Satan had to get permission to go from
[1:36:39] God to touch job so Satan has to go
[1:36:41] before God to us permission to affect
[1:36:44] you he's not running around freewheeling
[1:36:47] doing what he wants though he's gonna he
[1:36:49] sends a lot of emails can I do this job
[1:36:52] requests can I do this do this you know
[1:36:54] it's up to the boss God responds back
[1:36:57] yes no yes no here's the parameters and
[1:36:59] he can't go beyond the parameters right
[1:37:01] he couldn't you know he said to Satan
[1:37:04] you can touch everything but not joke
[1:37:06] Jobe wasn't touched he lost everything
[1:37:09] apart from his wife he oh he lost his
[1:37:10] kids and all the stuff and then many
[1:37:12] then Satan comes back oh it's only
[1:37:14] because he's fine
[1:37:15] you can do whatever you want just don't
[1:37:16] take his life came down to the very you
[1:37:20] know Satan comes Satan comes to the
[1:37:22] border you know and he if he couldn't go
[1:37:25] like this but he can't do it God won't
[1:37:27] let him right so we're gonna have
[1:37:29] confidence now everything that happens
[1:37:31] in life God has allowed and God never
[1:37:34] allow there's nothing vain God doesn't
[1:37:37] do a vain thing or allow a vain thing
[1:37:39] there's a reason for every trial we go
[1:37:41] through there's a reason for all the
[1:37:43] hardship there's even a reason that we
[1:37:45] receive pain and wounding how lujah it's
[1:37:48] not a vain thing right God will use it
[1:37:50] if you allow him to use it
[1:37:53] amen maybe this way we'll have different
[1:37:56] kind of testimonies someone comes and
[1:37:58] they say I can't relate to these people
[1:38:00] made me a brother and he pulls up said
[1:38:01] you know what I was or any one of us you
[1:38:04] know I can't relate you know these
[1:38:06] people never like me well what's your
[1:38:08] history oh this person this person this
[1:38:09] person you want to hear their story it's
[1:38:11] like they know my life well it's
[1:38:13] actually because they've walked in your
[1:38:14] shoes already that's why we'll have
[1:38:16] different contests funny
[1:38:17] hallelujah I'm glad I'm glad Lori to God
[1:38:21] I mean so it's ease now while so the
[1:38:25] life so a husband can be won by the life
[1:38:28] that the wife lives that's powerful I
[1:38:30] mean while they behold your chaste
[1:38:33] conversation coupled with fear whose
[1:38:35] adorning let it not be as an outward
[1:38:37] adoring of planning of here a wearing of
[1:38:39] gold or putting on of apparel but let it
[1:38:41] be the hidden man of the heart that
[1:38:44] which is not corruptible even the
[1:38:45] ornament
[1:38:46] of a meek and quiet spirit which is in
[1:38:48] the sight of God of great price now
[1:38:51] after this matter in all time the holy
[1:38:52] woman also who trusted in God adorned
[1:38:54] themselves being in subjection as their
[1:38:56] own husband's even as Sara obeyed
[1:38:58] Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters
[1:39:00] ye are as long as you do well and are
[1:39:03] not afraid with any amazement now here's
[1:39:05] some homework go look at the words there
[1:39:10] from the verse 4 speaks about a meek and
[1:39:15] quiet spirit doesn't mean a little mouse
[1:39:18] it doesn't say anything
[1:39:19] let's see someone who's not tossed
[1:39:21] always more steadfast right not not not
[1:39:24] troubled right but but go look at it you
[1:39:29] say well that's a monumental task know
[1:39:31] it we have the power right we have the
[1:39:36] power the Holy Ghost is here to make
[1:39:37] this live if it's not just all y'all
[1:39:39] it's not just a body change it's it's
[1:39:41] every part of life as long as the missus
[1:39:44] touches every part of life hallelujah
[1:39:46] there we can you know that the word is
[1:39:49] manifested not just in church not just
[1:39:51] in special singing praying whatever to
[1:39:52] us it's life you go down the street the
[1:39:54] word is manifested getting with your
[1:39:56] children the word is manifest you're at
[1:39:58] work the word is manifested hallelujah
[1:40:02] amen now if the Lord has taken up
[1:40:06] residence then that means we no longer
[1:40:08] have our own nature but we have the
[1:40:11] nature of God right we have the nature
[1:40:13] of God in us so that means now if we
[1:40:17] have the nature of God then what he says
[1:40:19] we should be in his word we will become
[1:40:21] it right because his life is in here to
[1:40:23] manifest that out of us right amen so
[1:40:26] now this is how we should be but now if
[1:40:29] we go to you say well I am you say I'm
[1:40:34] sick of war and gets my flesh I'll say
[1:40:39] that's a good thing
[1:40:40] because if you're in a battle that means
[1:40:44] there's two powers fighting but if you
[1:40:46] know the battle that means one powers
[1:40:48] one right so those people are just
[1:40:50] pandering to their flesh they don't have
[1:40:52] a battle against it because they just
[1:40:53] because their flesh is in control right
[1:40:55] but if they're but but if a person's
[1:40:58] really the heart's desire is I
[1:40:59] see you live Lord but this guy gets in a
[1:41:02] way but it's always gonna be a battle
[1:41:04] because it's his nature and your nature
[1:41:06] right and one is in control your one is
[1:41:09] in control so it's either your nature or
[1:41:11] his nature it defends us why Paul said
[1:41:13] we die daily you're going to give your
[1:41:15] nature over daily you got to keep that's
[1:41:16] what this thing's still alive it's gonna
[1:41:19] it's got to be changed you're following
[1:41:21] me I mean but see he said well I'm sick
[1:41:23] of racing against this flesh it's a
[1:41:24] struggle that's good that means I mean
[1:41:27] then that means you want to see the word
[1:41:29] become flesh in you hallelujah
[1:41:31] that's good to have that struggle amen
[1:41:34] will we ever get victory absolutely we
[1:41:37] get victory every day sometimes give me
[1:41:40] just few inches inches inches I mean in
[1:41:43] the final victory will be had this
[1:41:44] body's changed the life in you will
[1:41:46] change this body hallelujah amen now we
[1:41:56] look at the Old Testament now this is a
[1:41:58] bit of a segue quickly but Satan made
[1:42:00] all the believers fall through the Old
[1:42:02] Testament Moses buyers temper David
[1:42:05] buyers love a married woman
[1:42:06] you know many examples you can see God
[1:42:09] Satan made the prophets and the
[1:42:11] believers fail but now we've come to it
[1:42:13] and then even into the even into the New
[1:42:15] Testament Satan made the church falter
[1:42:17] to the Creed's of man at Nicaea but now
[1:42:20] there is a endtime bride that will not
[1:42:23] fall to their lives of Satan right so we
[1:42:26] will not fall to to his lies and we will
[1:42:30] not put up with just living halfway so
[1:42:33] now so so what I'm trying to say is with
[1:42:36] that is that we will you know that's why
[1:42:39] I read the word and and your hostas are
[1:42:41] trusses Lord I want to become what I
[1:42:42] read right I want to become us amen and
[1:42:47] he put that desire in you because he
[1:42:49] wants to see it manifest
[1:42:50] I believe amen now it season first
[1:42:54] Timothy five and eight and maybe we'll
[1:42:55] pick up this later but I just want to
[1:42:58] touch it very briefly what we've just
[1:43:00] read and what we're about to read first
[1:43:02] Timothy 5:8 says but if any provide not
[1:43:04] for his own and especially for those of
[1:43:07] his own house he has denied the faith
[1:43:09] and is worse than an infidel now many
[1:43:12] times we read their demand and we just
[1:43:14] take it as natural provision but to me
[1:43:16] it is not just natural provision I mean
[1:43:19] but it's spiritual provision right at a
[1:43:21] spiritual providing for your house right
[1:43:24] because if your house you know because
[1:43:26] if the house is meant to be a house
[1:43:28] serving the Lord and the head is not in
[1:43:31] its position then that is actually
[1:43:32] fighting against the rest of the family
[1:43:34] trying to come to their position in
[1:43:35] Christ right it's actually worse than an
[1:43:37] infidel it says here in the word right
[1:43:39] so now so if any does not provide for
[1:43:41] his own especially with those of his own
[1:43:43] house he has denied the faith and is
[1:43:45] worse than an infidel now to provide the
[1:43:48] would provide here means to consider in
[1:43:50] advance there is to look out for
[1:43:52] beforehand
[1:43:53] Amen it's it's by the way of maintenance
[1:43:56] amen as to provide and and in the root
[1:44:01] word one of the root words that would
[1:44:02] provide is to exercise the mind to
[1:44:04] observe that is to comprehend to
[1:44:06] consider perceived thinker understand so
[1:44:09] in order to provide for your spiritual
[1:44:11] needs of your house you better consider
[1:44:13] the ways they're going right you've got
[1:44:16] to actually consider you got to perceive
[1:44:17] what their needs are and you've got to
[1:44:19] meet that need and you look for the book
[1:44:21] you look for what's going to happen in
[1:44:22] the future you're following me right
[1:44:24] it's actually providing it's not just
[1:44:26] well we come to church we come Wednesday
[1:44:28] night you know and that's and and maybe
[1:44:30] we say a prayer for the meal
[1:44:31] that's not providing right you have a
[1:44:33] family altar right the member in the
[1:44:37] world everyone talks about you know
[1:44:39] there's like Santa Claus why don't we
[1:44:40] have Santa Claus here well the world's
[1:44:42] got Santa Claus they don't need another
[1:44:43] one here right there's plenty of
[1:44:45] Christmas trees out there we don't need
[1:44:46] one if you want Christmas tree you know
[1:44:49] we don't have one here because it yo you
[1:44:51] know what I mean like why do we need to
[1:44:52] talk about reindeer here well it's all
[1:44:54] that there we're here to talk about the
[1:44:56] Lord right and it should be the same
[1:44:58] thing at home our central focus should
[1:45:00] be him right a family that prays
[1:45:03] together
[1:45:04] face together a family talks about the
[1:45:06] word will stay together by a family
[1:45:09] that's transparent and it's got to start
[1:45:10] with the head of the home they say I'm
[1:45:12] struggling with theirs oh sorry I did
[1:45:14] this I didn't mean to be this way I'm
[1:45:15] tired of worn out I have going through
[1:45:17] this and your children what we can do
[1:45:18] appreciate that because I see daddy's
[1:45:21] human too you follow me Gettys you
[1:45:24] mommy's human too they go through
[1:45:26] battles as well and then if you really
[1:45:28] have good fellowship with them they will
[1:45:29] begin to see what the devil's that that
[1:45:32] mummy and daddy Ford overcome I'm
[1:45:33] fighting the same thing right and
[1:45:35] because what does the devil do the devil
[1:45:38] tries to tell you that you have you are
[1:45:40] the only one who's fought this thing no
[1:45:42] one understands you no one understands
[1:45:45] what you're going through
[1:45:46] they don't mom and dad wouldn't
[1:45:48] understand you they're like old you know
[1:45:51] they're all you know but the devil
[1:45:54] because the devil likes to isolate you
[1:45:56] know we can be families we can be a
[1:45:58] family in a house so we're gonna be a
[1:45:59] bunch of individuals in a house depends
[1:46:01] how you want to be and nobody just takes
[1:46:03] one person to break through one person
[1:46:06] to reach out and change the whole family
[1:46:08] dynamic
[1:46:08] hallelujah so that's you know he always
[1:46:11] tries to tell us that no one understands
[1:46:14] and if you really just sit down and talk
[1:46:16] to some all the ones you know they could
[1:46:19] just change the name of the devil you're
[1:46:21] fighting to the one they fought and you
[1:46:23] actually boil it down and see they are
[1:46:25] the same but if they overcame it that
[1:46:27] means I can overcome and that's why you
[1:46:30] begin to get godly counsel now well how
[1:46:32] did you overcome this I just can't seem
[1:46:34] to and that's a I couldn't overcome it
[1:46:36] either but the Lord I broke through the
[1:46:38] Lord and His grace helped me of this you
[1:46:42] just got to keep being perseverant with
[1:46:44] the Lord amen oh they say well so I see
[1:46:46] it's this or don't do this or don't do
[1:46:48] and and and you can sighs skip the whole
[1:46:50] trial you know many times we fight you
[1:46:53] know fight the same devil because we
[1:46:55] just go around and we and we instead of
[1:46:56] bypassing the trial we pick up the sword
[1:46:59] and chop his head off again and you find
[1:47:01] yourself why am i back here again
[1:47:03] just ignore him walk on you have to
[1:47:06] recognize the devil's defeated at
[1:47:07] Calvary he's a defeated being he was
[1:47:10] defeated at Calvary I mean that means
[1:47:12] you don't need to go fight the battle
[1:47:13] the Lord's already fought the battle a
[1:47:15] lot of time we just need to ignore the
[1:47:16] devil and walk
[1:47:18] just look sometimes you gotta take his
[1:47:20] hit off your arm to do it sometimes just
[1:47:23] ignoring my BAM speaks about that I mean
[1:47:28] so we need to as the head of our homes
[1:47:30] as the Lord has not the Lord provided
[1:47:32] our spiritual needs
[1:47:33] has he not thinking of us for the future
[1:47:37] right considered in advance what we have
[1:47:39] need of he has provided while we have
[1:47:41] need or for the future that's why he
[1:47:42] stored up a spiritual storehouse in this
[1:47:44] message how lure that because these can
[1:47:47] send our spiritual welfare he knew the
[1:47:49] world is going to get us dark as it's
[1:47:50] ever been
[1:47:51] darker it's ever been I mean it's going
[1:47:53] to be total gross darkness will cover
[1:47:55] the people but I'm going to put us in a
[1:47:57] word into the earth and maybe there'll
[1:47:59] be a light I will be the light in the
[1:48:01] darkest of Ages I mean that my people
[1:48:03] will grow up into my image that we built
[1:48:05] up until my image they'll become the
[1:48:07] word made flesh I mean they won't need
[1:48:09] to worry about the darkness because life
[1:48:11] is come
[1:48:11] hallelujah light has come upon the earth
[1:48:14] maybe then and they can rest a mat and
[1:48:16] then he begins to show now this is what
[1:48:18] the word is he proves himself over and
[1:48:21] over again you're the devil loves to try
[1:48:23] and tell us God doesn't love you God
[1:48:25] doesn't care that's a lie that's a lie
[1:48:27] from the pit of hell he does love you he
[1:48:30] does care he is interested in your life
[1:48:32] I mean you may have had a distant father
[1:48:34] but God is not a distant father God is
[1:48:37] not an indifferent man he's a caring
[1:48:39] loving man hallelujah I mean that's how
[1:48:42] he is we don't need to worry don't don't
[1:48:46] let God become how like how your dad was
[1:48:49] to you because unfortunately as children
[1:48:51] that's imprinted upon them that's
[1:48:53] imprinted upon us that how our father
[1:48:55] treats us is how we think God treats us
[1:48:58] and many times I'll say at least 99.99%
[1:49:03] of the time it's not the same but we
[1:49:06] need to but that's why you got a and
[1:49:08] that's a problem every relationship
[1:49:11] there will be hurt
[1:49:12] we're human we're human even the most
[1:49:16] loving relationship there will be hurt
[1:49:17] and it puts up a bit of a wall right so
[1:49:21] if that's even in the greatest
[1:49:22] relationship what about a terrible one
[1:49:24] the promise God wants to break through
[1:49:26] the hurt he wants to break through the
[1:49:28] wall and that's why you've got to
[1:49:30] actually tell yourself
[1:49:31] you saying Lord you're not like my dad
[1:49:34] amen you're not right there's some of
[1:49:37] the best dads in the world here so I'm
[1:49:39] not having got any when you understand
[1:49:40] but how we're raised I don't know where
[1:49:42] you're from but sometimes you know we've
[1:49:44] got to realize you know like my earthly
[1:49:46] father right I don't need the same wall
[1:49:48] up against you like I maybe have him
[1:49:52] amen and then he can work and you're
[1:49:58] glad we have a loving father I'm so
