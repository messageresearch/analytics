[27:16] go to Hebrews chapter 9 I mean it's real
[27:22] good to see brother John I was like I
[27:23] haven't seen you like a whale off it's
[27:26] been a long time it's good to see you
[27:27] god bless you amen
[27:29] let's go to Hebrews 9 and verse 1 I see
[27:33] if this is working
[27:40] Hebrews 9 and 1 then really the first
[27:46] covenant had also ordinance of divine
[27:50] service and a worldly sanctuary for
[27:53] there was a tabernacle made the first
[27:55] ruin was the candlestick and the table
[27:57] and the shewbread which is called the
[28:00] sanctuary and after the second Vail the
[28:03] tabernacle which is called the holiest
[28:05] of all which had the golden censer and
[28:08] the Ark of the Covenant over roundabout
[28:11] with gold when was the golden pot that
[28:14] had manna and Aaron's rod that budded
[28:17] and the tables of Covenant and over it
[28:21] the cherubims of glory shadowing the
[28:24] mercy seat of which we cannot now speak
[28:27] particularly now when these things were
[28:32] thus ordained the priests were always
[28:34] into the first Tabernacle accomplishing
[28:37] the service of God but into the second
[28:39] when the high priest alone once every
[28:42] year not without blood which he offered
[28:45] for himself and for the errors of the
[28:47] people the Holy Ghost this signifying
[28:50] that the way into the holiest of all was
[28:53] not yet made manifest while as the first
[28:55] Tabernacle was yet standing which was a
[28:59] figure for the time the impressive
[29:01] in which were offered both gifts and
[29:03] sacrifices they could not make him that
[29:07] did the service perfect as pertaining to
[29:10] the conscience which stood only in meats
[29:13] and drinks and divers washings and
[29:15] carnal ordinances imposed on them until
[29:18] the time of reformation now let's go to
[29:21] the next chapter Hebrews 10 and from
[29:25] verse 19 and it says here then having
[29:29] therefore brethren boldness to enter
[29:33] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[29:36] by a new and living way which he hath
[29:39] consecrated for us through the veil that
[29:41] is to say his flesh and having an High
[29:44] Priest over the house of God let us draw
[29:46] near with a true heart in full assurance
[29:49] of faith having our hearts sprinkled
[29:51] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[29:53] washed with pure water let us hold fast
[29:56] the profession of our faith without
[29:58] wavering for he is faithful that
[30:00] promised and let us consider one another
[30:02] to provoke unto love and to good works
[30:04] not forsaking the assembling of
[30:07] ourselves together as the manner of some
[30:08] is but exhorting one another and so much
[30:12] more as you see the Day approaching
[30:14] amen this bow is a word of Prayer if you
[30:17] have a need just want to raise your
[30:18] hands to the Lord to be remembered in
[30:20] prayer
[30:21] gracious father how thankful we are we
[30:23] can gather as your redeemed children
[30:25] Lord washed in your blood Lord made new
[30:28] creatures in you how thankful we are
[30:30] father for Lord just your mercy upon us
[30:33] and Lord we thank you we can gather and
[30:36] I just pray as we a here Lord we do not
[30:39] desire to go through a religious motion
[30:41] just because it's a Sunday morning but
[30:43] we have come to have a meeting with you
[30:45] Lord God we've come to call you to a
[30:47] conference Lord that you would mould us
[30:49] and you would shape us and you change us
[30:51] and you would wash us Lord and Lord you
[30:53] would refill us with your spirit Lord
[30:55] and father as we go into talking about
[30:58] the tabernacle this morning Lord may
[30:59] become a reality
[31:01] Lord may it not be just a teaching Lord
[31:03] or just a theory but Lord may it become
[31:05] a reality to us I pray please may you
[31:07] grant it father be at those through a
[31:09] way Lord who a second body Lord may you
[31:12] heal them and raise them up but we know
[31:14] by your stripes they were
[31:15] he'll bother sick among us here as well
[31:17] heal us Lord and father I pray Lord that
[31:20] everyone Lord would be changed Lord
[31:23] because they've been here this morning
[31:24] father by your spirit Lord may you grant
[31:27] it Lord may nothing distract us Lord may
[31:29] all unbelief be cast away by the blood
[31:31] of Jesus Christ thought of may you have
[31:33] preeminence in every life please may you
[31:36] grant it Lord take the service under
[31:38] your control we pray in Jesus Christ's
[31:40] name Amen amen god bless you all you may
[31:43] have your seats this morning so one who
[31:46] I want to speak about ahead in life with
[31:49] Christ being hidden away and I wonder if
[31:53] I could give it a subtitle I want to ask
[31:55] you the question where are you living
[31:56] today amen now we understand that being
[31:59] a believer is more than just coming to
[32:02] church or having a profession but it's
[32:03] actually a place where you live and we
[32:06] know that that is in the presence of God
[32:07] and so we read about the tabernacle
[32:09] there because under the blood of bulls
[32:12] and goats we understand that only the
[32:15] high priest could go into the Holy of
[32:17] Holies where the Ark of the Covenant was
[32:19] in different things and that's where the
[32:20] presence of God was and you know and so
[32:24] and the believer could come into the
[32:26] outer court maybe I'll just show you a
[32:27] diagram I'm going to refer to this quite
[32:29] a lot but the but the so here's the
[32:34] entrance here and so here's the outer
[32:37] court now the worshipper brings his
[32:39] sacrifice here the priest takes the
[32:41] sacrifice examines the sacrifice if
[32:43] their sacrifice is found to be perfect
[32:45] then it's presented and it's offered on
[32:47] their behalf and then now the priest
[32:50] could come into the holy place here but
[32:52] only the high priest once a year with
[32:54] blood you'd come into the most most holy
[32:56] place and this is where God lived he
[32:59] doesn't live out here he didn't live out
[33:00] here but yet he blessed those places but
[33:03] God was in here and that's where where
[33:05] we just read now the the veil was here
[33:08] where only the high priest once the
[33:10] earth blood could go into this place
[33:11] but Jesus by his veil yahoos his flesh
[33:15] was raped which showed that by a new and
[33:17] living way now man had gone to the
[33:20] presence of God hallelujah and that's
[33:22] why when Jesus died that down Calvary
[33:24] the vow was raised as a temple from top
[33:26] to bottom signifying by his blood
[33:28] that all 101 who would believe I mean
[33:32] could go and dwell in the prison's of
[33:33] God continually hallelujah and that's
[33:36] where that's where the believer must
[33:38] live is not out here or in here and
[33:41] we're gonna break these things down are
[33:43] you gonna live in here I mean and this
[33:45] is a secret place when you're shuddered
[33:46] with God in the world is shut out
[33:48] hallelujah
[33:50] now I'm gonna show you hey I just want
[33:52] to show you a this is a replica one of
[33:55] the replicas you can see I just googled
[33:57] yo now this this was the tabernacle the
[34:00] wilderness a replica now if you look at
[34:03] it it doesn't look like much it's not
[34:05] some big temple complex not a bunch of
[34:07] gold by just stone you know it doesn't
[34:09] look like an incredible building and
[34:11] even Solomon's first temple wasn't an
[34:14] incredible building if you compare it to
[34:16] other your religious temples and
[34:18] different things but the differences God
[34:20] was there
[34:21] that's the main thing you know what God
[34:23] veils his glory to the outside world
[34:26] God valses glory to the outside world
[34:28] but the world puts its glory on display
[34:30] but inside it's a bunch of dead man's
[34:33] bones right just like Jesus says you
[34:37] know he says to the scribes and
[34:38] Pharisees in Matthew 23 he says that
[34:41] outwardly you know you know outwardly
[34:44] you're you're a bunch of wider wall
[34:46] schipperkes beautiful buildings but
[34:49] inwardly you're a bunch of dead man's
[34:50] bones right this wishes of Matthew 23 so
[34:53] outwardly they looked all good but
[34:55] inwardly they were did and that's how
[34:57] the world is outwardly it looks
[34:58] beautiful
[34:59] you take the Vatican beautiful piece of
[35:01] art but inward it's dead man's bones
[35:03] there's no life is no life in that place
[35:06] but yet that's why John marveled in the
[35:08] book of Revelation he marveled at her
[35:10] but because it was so beautiful burrito
[35:12] was so wicked and evil and that's how
[35:15] the world was but God Vale's themself in
[35:18] simplicity and that's why you've got to
[35:20] look the believer veils God I mean we
[35:23] may not look so great to the outside but
[35:26] inwardly God does dwelling hallelujah so
[35:31] now so here's the article we talk about
[35:35] this first pass the holy place in the
[35:37] Holy of Holies now
[35:40] is the question I want to ask us so so
[35:43] where are you living
[35:44] where are you living because I want you
[35:46] to know there's a big difference
[35:48] so the believer could come to this place
[35:50] they they they ate manna in the
[35:53] wilderness they all ate heavenly bread
[35:55] Jesus is I am that bridge they so they
[35:57] ate on the word and they rejoiced but if
[36:00] that man had got all to them right there
[36:03] got oh they couldn't keep it over to the
[36:04] next day and got stale so that our
[36:06] experience got stale and rotten every
[36:08] day they needed a new experience right
[36:10] and now living outside out here the
[36:14] elements affected them so if it was
[36:16] raining or as cold or as hot you know
[36:19] they were tossed about by the elements
[36:24] amen
[36:25] so so you know you know outside if
[36:28] you're living outside you're worried
[36:29] about the weather and what's happening
[36:31] and that will affect your walk is it too
[36:34] cold to go worship today is it too hot I
[36:36] mean someone's you know I you're upset
[36:38] you're not upset you're up you're down
[36:40] your left your right what's happening
[36:42] because the weather's affecting you yes
[36:44] this is our Christian walk we come on
[36:47] here present your body a living
[36:48] sacrifice right and then you're washed
[36:51] for service wash from the world then you
[36:54] come into the air into the holy place
[36:56] you're eating the bread of life you're
[37:00] living according to our artificial life
[37:02] and you're offering up prayers this
[37:04] priesthood right but then you've got to
[37:07] go within the veil into the holy place
[37:08] with a life of God as a means to the
[37:13] survey so there's the altar of burnt
[37:15] offerings and the Bible says we must
[37:17] present our bodies a living sacrifice
[37:19] that's repent repent him you know give
[37:22] yourself and then be baptized the name
[37:24] of Jesus Christ be washed amen yes many
[37:28] people live in us and then you can go in
[37:30] you can go and you can go out you can go
[37:32] and you can go out we can't let the
[37:34] world to fix our walk amen
[37:37] you got to see what's affecting where
[37:39] are you living well I go to church I was
[37:40] raising the message but have you met him
[37:42] do you know him you got to know him to
[37:45] know him as life right this word has to
[37:47] become a living reality
[37:49] hallelujah it must become a living
[37:51] reality Jesus says you must be born
[37:53] again
[37:53] there was this first doctrine amen and
[37:56] then now you come to the outer court
[37:59] it's exposed to the elements
[38:01] anyone can come in here who wasn't
[38:02] Israelite and out there they were eating
[38:05] manner but it went off they couldn't
[38:07] keep it up for the next day right so you
[38:10] can have a camp experience you can have
[38:12] a glorious time but it doesn't last a
[38:14] minyan come under the anointing they all
[38:17] ate GE or they were saying to Jesus our
[38:20] fathers ate manna in the wilderness and
[38:22] then Jesus says but there everyone did
[38:24] he said he overthrew them in the
[38:26] wilderness because that their unbelief
[38:28] that and interent arrest so they all
[38:30] receive the blessings of God they they
[38:32] were all delivered out of Egypt God did
[38:34] the supernatural among them God gave
[38:36] them his word God dwelt among them but
[38:38] yet they didn't they were just living
[38:40] out here
[38:41] they weren't converted they weren't
[38:43] changed just like many people they can
[38:45] be they can repent be baptized for them
[38:47] being converted right you got to be
[38:50] converted hallelujah and God's editors
[38:53] are converting amen so we can live out
[38:57] here and it can be wonderful but then it
[38:59] can be bad don't read their journey from
[39:01] Egypt into the Promised Land you'll see
[39:04] that a lot of murmuring and complaining
[39:05] because they're living in the outer
[39:06] Court we don't want to live out there we
[39:09] don't want to stay there don't stay
[39:11] where you are go forward
[39:12] walk forward I mean don't stay well this
[39:15] is where I've always been go forward by
[39:16] faith yes I mean then now we come here
[39:20] and then we're going to go into the holy
[39:23] place now the holy place the holy place
[39:26] is inside so the it can be raining it
[39:31] can be snowing it can be whatever the
[39:33] weather can be doing this thing but now
[39:35] the person is protected in their stand
[39:37] unaffected by the world anymore right
[39:40] they've come in so now this person can
[39:44] be standing out here soaking and these
[39:46] ones are high and dry and this one can
[39:50] be saying well this is dragging me down
[39:51] and I'm battling with this and then
[39:53] someone in here saying is what do you
[39:54] mean I don't have their problem
[39:56] I've been cleansed of it I men are you
[39:59] following me what I'm saying right so
[40:01] someone can have a temple like a bus
[40:04] you know they can have unforgiveness
[40:05] indifference and you can't still have
[40:07] that in here as well yeah right but you
[40:10] know you could have things but you
[40:11] overcome in here
[40:12] a few things and then so it doesn't
[40:14] bother you when you're inside right amen
[40:19] but this though is all artificial this
[40:22] is still artificial he it was the lamps
[40:25] tear they had to put oil into the lamp a
[40:28] man had to physically take oil put it
[40:30] into the lamp had to make the thing you
[40:33] know they they had to keep it lit they
[40:38] had to keep it lit it was man's doing
[40:40] this is where people come sincerely they
[40:42] repent they get baptized and they come
[40:44] in here the world doesn't affect them so
[40:46] much anymore but then now it's all their
[40:49] own doing and this is where people get
[40:51] discouraged this is where people get
[40:53] discouraged because their own out of
[40:55] their own sincerity because everyone
[40:56] wants to serve God don't they
[40:57] everyone wants to live for him because
[40:58] they love him right but this is their
[41:01] own effort the bread had to be baked the
[41:04] bread had to be baked if you let the
[41:06] bread they're too long it'll get moldy
[41:08] right so so the bread had to be baked
[41:11] the the oil had to be put into the
[41:14] candles and then the altar of incense
[41:17] that had to be humanely done making the
[41:20] incense and you're that's that's that's
[41:23] a the altar of prayer but yet they're
[41:27] inside
[41:27] they've been sanctified from the world
[41:30] right to a degree but they're living in
[41:34] this place now the biggest problem that
[41:37] people have as they live in here and
[41:40] they don't go in here but yet they think
[41:43] they're living in here yeah right you
[41:46] don't want to be living in here and
[41:47] thinking you're in here when you're not
[41:48] there right I mean this is the biggest
[41:51] problem that the believers have is that
[41:53] people are still in the holy place yet
[41:55] they're priests and kings to God right
[41:58] you're not living outside they're not
[42:00] out here David buss and their walk so
[42:02] it's good but don't stay in here right
[42:06] that's where many people say no
[42:07] artificial light that the lamp can go
[42:11] out the oil can stop being added it can
[42:14] get smoky and then the Lance can get
[42:16] smoky so you can't really see
[42:17] you know what's going on anymore and it
[42:21] can affect people in a bad way it's I
[42:25] want to make a big contrast between
[42:26] these two I'm not so worried about out
[42:29] here because most of us have advanced
[42:31] from repentance and baptism right but we
[42:34] want to go beyond just living in this
[42:36] place God doesn't want you living in
[42:38] there he doesn't want you there he wants
[42:40] you in here he wants you in his presence
[42:43] that's why it's called uni that's why
[42:45] he's spoken to us why send this message
[42:47] and then you would live in his presence
[42:48] I mean because this veil has been
[42:51] reached the vial of tradition has been
[42:54] reached the vial of tradition of church
[42:56] in just church ology and and tradition
[42:58] of man that's been written Twain in the
[43:00] sour hallelujah this is the seven golden
[43:02] candlesticks that John saw you don't
[43:05] want to live be living in just a church
[43:06] age light you're gonna be living in the
[43:09] presence of the king helu yeah now let's
[43:16] read oh now that's how God promised in
[43:21] the days gone by that in the stay that
[43:23] he would write his laws not upon tables
[43:26] of stone but upon the heart he had
[43:28] placed the law in the heart
[43:29] Ezekiel spoke of it and the prophets all
[43:31] spoke of how God would do that in the
[43:33] days coming which was a type but the
[43:36] high priest what's going into the
[43:37] holiest of Holies then the curtain
[43:40] dropped soundproof
[43:41] he was shut off from the things of the
[43:43] world no one could see him he was head
[43:45] away through the Lutheran Age came forth
[43:48] for JA shall live by faith that's the
[43:49] outer Court along came the Methodists
[43:52] age the sanctification age which is what
[43:54] I told the holy place they call it the
[43:56] secret they caught the second definite
[43:57] work of grace which come in that age and
[44:00] there's the older age then in the last
[44:03] days the restoration of the Holy Spirit
[44:05] the hidden life and I'm sure that's
[44:08] where the trouble lays I want you to see
[44:10] it right here's where the trouble lays
[44:12] with the church today coming from the
[44:14] can't deviate between the altar and the
[44:16] holiest of Holies and there's where's
[44:19] the place with a church or to be if I
[44:22] mean there's too many of them still on
[44:24] the outside out here instead of being in
[44:27] here so he's saying these two
[44:29] many here and see the Bing in here right
[44:33] right this is where the where are you
[44:36] living today right this is the big
[44:38] question where are you living are you
[44:39] here are you here
[44:41] or are you in here right right
[44:46] amen so now now here comes in this real
[44:53] life real life is manifested in here
[44:56] right this is all I'm sure you can all
[44:59] agree the priest had to keep adding to
[45:02] this keep doing keep doing keep doing
[45:04] right and there's always an element of
[45:06] that in our Christian walk but they
[45:08] depended solely on their ability to keep
[45:11] the lamp going keep the bread there he
[45:13] is the bread of life right and then keep
[45:16] the prayer going they had to keep doing
[45:18] doing doing a people get discouraged why
[45:21] because they haven't got the life that
[45:22] pushes out they haven't got the life
[45:24] that manifests itself out of them
[45:26] hallelujah that's how we meant to be God
[45:29] has been to come in and live out of us
[45:31] we just yield to him and he produces his
[45:33] own life amen
[45:35] so now but the veil here was rent that
[45:39] day on Calvary I mean where we just read
[45:42] we read that this was here signifying
[45:45] under the blood of bulls and goats that
[45:47] the way into the holiest of all was not
[45:49] yet made benefits but then by the blood
[45:52] of Jesus Christ
[45:53] this veil has been rent right so now
[45:56] beforehand the high priest could only go
[45:59] and once a year into here and if you
[46:01] just went in it would have been death if
[46:03] he went in without blood without being
[46:05] dressed right without being anointed
[46:07] right and then he would have died in the
[46:09] presence of God holy or so so he comes
[46:12] the high priest now once a year so so
[46:15] sacrifice is offered for him and the
[46:17] people he's washed he's dressed right
[46:20] hallelujah then he comes in here does
[46:23] service in here and then by the blood he
[46:25] can come in and and sprinkle the blood I
[46:27] mean on the mercy seat and now there's
[46:29] mercy for the people amen and now it's
[46:32] the same thing with us we come in we we
[46:35] repeat we're baptized then we dressed
[46:39] I mean dressed Rob did his righteousness
[46:42] right because maybe around the hem of
[46:45] the high priests garment is a
[46:46] pomegranate Bell pomegranate pal driving
[46:48] around and when he walked that cried out
[46:50] holy holy holy to the Lord so his whole
[46:53] walk was holy holy holy to the Lord and
[46:57] it should be the same thing with you and
[46:58] I and then when we get up in the morning
[47:00] out laughs am i crying holy holy holy to
[47:03] the Lord everything we do should be holy
[47:05] holy holy to the Lord hallelujah
[47:08] I mean - then and then he was anointed
[47:10] with the rice of Sharon I mean Jesus was
[47:13] crushed here as the Rose of Sharon order
[47:14] to get the perfume out the rice had to
[47:16] be crushed he was crushed shut down
[47:18] Calvary that the fragrance could come
[47:20] out amen he is anointed and he had the
[47:22] blood because he's going to go worship
[47:26] hallelujah
[47:27] amen so now here we come here we come
[47:30] through the same way God justifies us
[47:34] then we sanctified amen and and the
[47:37] blood gives access all the way through
[47:39] but don't just stay in the sanctified
[47:41] state your own doing your own doing your
[47:44] own doing
[47:44] make it history make it has doing yes
[47:48] Amen so now the veil has been rent now
[47:52] in here as the is the Ark of the
[47:56] Covenant it's the mercy seat
[47:58] there's also Aaron's rod and there's the
[48:01] and there's the two tables of stone and
[48:04] then there's the golden pot of manna
[48:06] that never went old that never went old
[48:10] it was the same matter that fell out
[48:11] here the same word that fell out here
[48:14] was the same word that was in here the
[48:17] difference is here it got stale and old
[48:19] and it couldn't be kept up but here it
[48:22] never got old and a believer that is
[48:25] coming to the Holy of Holies the word is
[48:27] still fresh
[48:32] it doesn't get stale I've read that
[48:34] before I've heard that before I've heard
[48:36] this all my entire life that's a style
[48:38] experience I mean but if you're living
[48:40] in the prints of King it doesn't get old
[48:42] and doesn't get stale it just gets
[48:44] better over time
[48:46] hallelujah so where are you living
[48:48] people get bored they come in with
[48:50] excitement I mean they may be at a
[48:52] temple God moves in church they have a
[48:54] glorious time but then but then it gets
[48:56] stale and they wonder what's going on
[49:00] it's cuz they're living out here
[49:02] don't let the would be stale to you
[49:05] don't let it get moldy I mean you gotta
[49:08] you gotta don't just eat it in there you
[49:09] got to come in here it doesn't get this
[49:12] word gets prettier every day is not
[49:19] stale I'm it's just richer and better
[49:21] and this message the Bible should get
[49:23] richer every day Amen better it all
[49:26] depends where you're living because gods
[49:30] in here gods in this place he I
[49:33] understand he blazes this place but he's
[49:34] in this place right they want to be in
[49:37] this place living in the presence of the
[49:40] king
[49:41] Alleluia now also so that's the big
[49:45] difference if you're if if the word is
[49:48] wonderful Amen it's not stale to you
[49:52] you're in here I'm just wise where you
[49:56] living this is not crossing the T's and
[49:58] dotting the eyes it's a life that lives
[50:02] in you
[50:02] right so the word should be wonderful it
[50:05] should mean more to you every day should
[50:07] be fresh oh how I love Jesus amen
[50:13] now also another thing that was in there
[50:15] was Aaron's rod now Aaron he carried his
[50:20] rod now that rod was fashioned Aaron
[50:25] when he was carrying it was fashioned by
[50:27] man's hands right it was fashioned a rod
[50:29] is shaped cut to the right size it's
[50:32] shaped for the for the master to use so
[50:36] it was a it was once living it was taken
[50:39] off a tree or maybe
[50:40] on the ground I don't know and then it
[50:42] was fashioned and it's the same thing
[50:44] with you and I this world was the
[50:46] fashioner rightful religion wants to
[50:48] fashion a shape us it was man's tools
[50:51] man's knowledge shake the rod and they
[50:54] say now it's in service now I can use it
[50:56] cuz it's been shaped no that wasn't what
[50:59] God wanted God wanted there's a life in
[51:02] that and that piece of did wood and I'm
[51:04] and you know I've been run and had to
[51:06] produce almonds and produce fruit right
[51:09] and so now I want you to notice it's
[51:11] like the same thing with you and I we
[51:13] went we're off the tree of life of the
[51:15] tree of humanity I'll put it that way
[51:17] but outside the prints of God were just
[51:19] a dead stick right potentially there's
[51:22] fruit on us they can be produced but it
[51:24] has to be in the right atmosphere has to
[51:27] be in the right presence to bring forth
[51:29] I mean that's why it's so important when
[51:31] we gather and God comes down there's an
[51:33] atmosphere I mean this produced Holly
[51:36] you say well I don't have any part of
[51:38] the service you sing you pray you you
[51:41] you thank him for everything that he's
[51:43] done for you it produces an atmosphere
[51:45] around you what happens God draws near
[51:47] hallelujah net and that begins to affect
[51:49] the one next year the one in front of
[51:51] you
[51:52] hallelujah what begins to happen now
[51:54] life can come the atmosphere is vital
[51:57] it's very important so now I want you to
[52:00] notice he comes I think I think Moses
[52:03] put it in there and here it's still a
[52:07] dead stick it's in the outer court
[52:09] mallalieu yeah Lisa's not out there it's
[52:12] in here good wonderful it's still a dead
[52:15] stick right in here in the holy place
[52:18] oh it's God it's advised asila date
[52:20] stick another dead stick amen but then
[52:24] when it comes in here goes beyond the
[52:26] rail it's not a dead stick anymore it's
[52:29] buddy life is coming for hallelujah that
[52:32] all the shaping of man does not stop
[52:34] producing
[52:36] I mean it's the same thing with us the
[52:39] world can try and shake you man's
[52:41] religion can try and shape you but when
[52:43] you get in the presence of God I mean
[52:45] that life will come for hallelujah
[52:48] that's if you've got life to produce
[52:51] Amen begin to produce fruit now it's the
[52:56] same thing with the believer we can come
[52:59] in here we can fastest you and jump up
[53:02] and down we can come up here we can
[53:04] fastest you and jump up and down amen
[53:07] but in here you can't do that and here
[53:11] this is all human life being produced
[53:13] out here that's right this is religious
[53:15] human life but then when you go beyond
[53:18] the veil it's not religious human life
[53:20] anymore it's the life of God being
[53:22] produced hallelujah and that's how you
[53:25] know someone's living in the presence of
[53:27] the king Amen is that one the word
[53:31] doesn't get old the world is shut off I
[53:34] mean they're not affected by the rain
[53:37] and the good times prices name and the
[53:40] bad times do the same hallelujah doesn't
[53:44] matter if the world's falling apart
[53:45] hallelujah doesn't matter it's going
[53:47] well hallelujah as a matter full of
[53:50] forsaken me hallelujah as a matter of
[53:52] your sick up to you up to here glory
[53:55] hallelujah
[53:56] I mean you can be on a bed second you
[53:58] can be saying glory to God I'm so glad
[54:01] he lifted me hallelujah I'm so glad
[54:03] Jesus hit me free you know the joy we
[54:07] have is a reality amen
[54:10] and here and his presence is the
[54:12] fullness of joy peace that passes all
[54:14] understanding amen this is this is where
[54:18] it is so now in here and here we begin
[54:23] to produce a life and the world is shut
[54:26] out the world is shut out what all the
[54:31] other believers are doing a shut out
[54:32] this is you and God in here this is you
[54:35] and God you can have another priest in
[54:37] here with you and they can bump over the
[54:41] shewbread they can knock the candle they
[54:42] can do all kinds of things and it can
[54:44] bother you I was trying to worship God
[54:47] and you're bumping the candle you're
[54:48] tripping over you
[54:49] MSU you know doesn't that affect women
[54:52] that affect you you try and do a job and
[54:54] the other person's clumsy knocking
[54:55] things around come on men straighten up
[54:58] but in here it doesn't bother you and
[55:02] here it's younger this is all shut out
[55:06] there's a disavow those drop them behind
[55:09] you when you go through I'll let you
[55:12] you're worshiping the very Lord God of
[55:14] heaven and earth
[55:15] Allu yeah and the wonderful thing is
[55:18] when you come in here is it's not a
[55:20] judgement seat then it's a mercy seat
[55:23] causes blood on it right you see mercy
[55:26] when you come into his presence when
[55:28] you're really coming to the coming to
[55:30] the Holy of Holies now I mean it's not a
[55:32] judgement seat its mercy because the
[55:35] blood has bloods been sprinkled
[55:37] hallelujah see not under the
[55:39] condemnation anymore but you're free
[55:41] Amen because you see this blood being
[55:43] sprinkled hallelujah Amen now let's see
[55:51] if we could find this one yeah here oh
[55:55] now every man this thing of the inner
[55:58] the holy place every man that stays in
[56:01] the prints of God later on it speaks of
[56:03] it into this great secret place head
[56:05] away will yield the fruit of
[56:06] righteousness Peace Love joy
[56:08] long-suffering goodness gentleness
[56:10] patience don't fuss about these other
[56:13] things get that in your life and you'll
[56:16] never get it out until you hide away
[56:19] with God into the land of adoption
[56:22] another thing we will call your
[56:24] attention just before clothes look at
[56:26] the light on the outside courts there
[56:29] was the firmament that lit it up
[56:30] sunlight so forth some days were cloudy
[56:33] some days had sand and shine at all some
[56:36] days it was dark now that's the outer
[56:38] court the next court was the lamp of God
[56:41] with a justified stand and it was lit by
[56:43] human hands that's where we argue our
[56:46] denominations where we argue our
[56:48] differences split hairs and oh I don't
[56:51] believe in divine healing I don't
[56:52] believe the envisions come from God I
[56:54] don't believe this I don't believe that
[56:56] you're arguing because you're living yet
[56:58] you're eating manner but you're living
[57:00] under an artificial light that's
[57:03] right sometimes the light goes out
[57:06] that's in here that's in here and here
[57:11] it's very different now as I see it
[57:14] before this place when a person comes
[57:18] into this place the world is shut out
[57:22] and they are shut in with him
[57:24] the world doesn't matter anymore there
[57:28] is nothing the light in here is
[57:29] supernatural Amen it's not a natural
[57:32] light it's not a man-made light this
[57:36] this is a man-made life right this is a
[57:39] religious man made life though it's good
[57:41] but yet and here is a supernatural life
[57:44] a supernatural light hallelujah when
[57:47] your attention isn't what the other
[57:49] priests are doing and whatever more your
[57:52] attention is him amen imagine walking
[57:55] from here to there would be very
[57:58] different very different kind of
[57:59] atmosphere
[58:00] I mean a very different kind of presence
[58:02] because God is there that's where God is
[58:05] and it's the same thing
[58:06] now when the believer really enters into
[58:08] the most holy place is an atmosphere as
[58:10] around them right there's some people
[58:13] you love to be around believers who just
[58:16] love to be around and what is that
[58:17] because there's an atmosphere around
[58:18] them you know that they love you
[58:21] hallelujah there's the atmosphere of
[58:23] love around them that's because they've
[58:25] been in the presence of God they dwell
[58:27] in this place and there's a life that's
[58:29] being produced
[58:30] I mean just like Ayman Aaron's rod that
[58:35] budded that produced a life that was
[58:38] meant to be produced now we can't
[58:40] humanly produce a Christian life how it
[58:45] should be it takes God to produce that
[58:47] life
[58:48] now and and this is where we should be
[58:53] living
[58:54] hallelujah this is where we're cool to
[58:56] live and the presence of our King now I
[59:00] want to turn I want to turn to the Book
[59:03] of Ezekiel and and chapter 36
[59:09] [Music]
[59:11] does anyone understand the difference I
[59:13] know we're teaching a little bit today
[59:14] but yeah you look at it now where are
[59:17] you living
[59:18] are you living from one camp to the next
[59:20] camp one special meaning to the next
[59:23] special meeting where are you living
[59:25] from we'll get the blessings right but
[59:28] then it's very different going from camp
[59:31] experience to camp experience we need
[59:32] those times right but when you come in
[59:35] here it's not you it's not you trying to
[59:38] produce the life trying to be good in
[59:40] your ability it's his doing all right my
[59:43] laws their hearts and I'll do them it
[59:46] means it's very different being just
[59:48] mentally up here well I'm gonna do this
[59:49] and don't do this and brother Graham
[59:51] said this and I should do this and the
[59:52] Bible says this and you know if it's in
[59:55] here if you've been reprogrammed you're
[59:57] gonna live according to your programming
[59:59] right so if you're programmed according
[1:00:01] to the world then that's how you live
[1:00:03] but if you've been reprogrammed is God's
[1:00:06] programming in you you can't do you can
[1:00:08] only do what your programming is right
[1:00:10] just like a computer it could only the
[1:00:12] programs on it's all you can use a
[1:00:14] computer for unless you put other
[1:00:16] programming in it amen it's the same
[1:00:19] thing with us now Ezekiel I don't have
[1:00:21] this up here but it says Ezekiel 36 and
[1:00:24] verse 25 verses verse 24 rather because
[1:00:34] because people have said to me well but
[1:00:36] the Holy Ghost has been given so
[1:00:38] everyone receives it you have to receive
[1:00:41] it yourself right just because it was
[1:00:43] given the down Pentecost doesn't mean
[1:00:45] you automatically receive it without any
[1:00:47] sensation or any life afterwards
[1:00:49] the high priest would know that he is in
[1:00:52] the presence of God in the Holy Place
[1:00:54] right they knew when they're in the
[1:00:57] prints of Jesus there's a difference
[1:00:58] about Jesus Christ because that was the
[1:01:00] Messiah that was God in flesh amen we're
[1:01:03] now the other day of Pentecost and God
[1:01:05] came down it was very different to the
[1:01:07] first nine days when they're in the
[1:01:08] upper room it was a very different kind
[1:01:10] of experience it wasn't now well I
[1:01:12] believe by faith that the promises come
[1:01:14] we've been in do with power from on high
[1:01:16] now let's go preach that's it no no no
[1:01:18] we got to wait wait until we're in Jude
[1:01:20] with power from on high and they
[1:01:22] and they really received that power it
[1:01:25] was a reality not by well just by faith
[1:01:28] that nothing happens that's why the
[1:01:30] Apostle Paul said to a polis x19 have
[1:01:33] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:01:35] believed you know and he was honest well
[1:01:38] we haven't heard if there been any Holy
[1:01:39] Ghost there's a reality has it happened
[1:01:41] to you that's why you've got to go all
[1:01:45] the way in they said well I believe yeah
[1:01:47] don't just stay there because every one
[1:01:50] it one has to come to a knowledge that
[1:01:52] God is but you got to go from just there
[1:01:54] you go all the way in and be transformed
[1:01:57] by his Spirit verse verse 24 and I'll
[1:02:02] take from you I'll take you from among
[1:02:04] the heathen and gather you out of all
[1:02:07] countries and bring you into your own
[1:02:08] land
[1:02:09] we've been gathered to the Word of God
[1:02:11] that's our land we've been taken out a
[1:02:13] man from among the heathen right from
[1:02:17] among the ones that don't know God we've
[1:02:18] been gathered and you may have we say
[1:02:21] been born in church where you got to
[1:02:22] have a you still got to have a birth
[1:02:24] your parents were taken out but you've
[1:02:26] got to know the same God your parents
[1:02:28] know then will they sprinkle clean water
[1:02:31] upon you and you shall be clean from all
[1:02:34] your filthiness and from your idols will
[1:02:37] I cleanse you so they come a cleansing
[1:02:39] and we're washed by the water of the
[1:02:40] word right
[1:02:42] we have been washed from from
[1:02:43] Trinitarian idols from false baptisms
[1:02:46] amen will be washed those are idols
[1:02:49] crafted from the Word of God will be
[1:02:51] washed from them hallelujah and from all
[1:02:53] your filthiness and from your idols will
[1:02:56] I cleanse you but that's not thee that's
[1:02:58] not the end right you got to keep
[1:03:01] walking with God and you had also will I
[1:03:05] give you and a new spirit will I put
[1:03:08] within you and I'll take away the stony
[1:03:11] heart out of your flesh and I'll give
[1:03:12] you a heart of flesh you know before we
[1:03:15] meet God we can't really live with
[1:03:16] ourselves having God come live with you
[1:03:19] dwell in you if you can't even live with
[1:03:21] your own self God couldn't live with you
[1:03:23] and your condition your firstborn and he
[1:03:26] had to change you he had to change you
[1:03:28] in order for him to come and dwell right
[1:03:30] if you couldn't get along with yourself
[1:03:32] how can the heavenly dove come and dwell
[1:03:34] on you
[1:03:35] right a band and this Hester he's got to
[1:03:38] give you a new nature right amen give
[1:03:42] you a new a new spirit a new heart but
[1:03:45] don't stay there notice and I will put
[1:03:48] my spirit within you and cause you to
[1:03:52] walk in my statutes and you shall keep
[1:03:55] my judgments and do them I mean so I
[1:03:58] will put my spirit so after that's
[1:04:00] happened let's go back so this so called
[1:04:05] out washed sanctified Amen a new spirit
[1:04:11] a new hearts been given but then now my
[1:04:14] spirit I'll give you I'll put my spirit
[1:04:18] within you and cause you to walk in my
[1:04:20] statutes and you shall keep my judgments
[1:04:23] and do them why is that the case because
[1:04:26] he gives you his spirit amen so it goes
[1:04:30] beyond just your own doing it's now his
[1:04:34] doing and has to go you have to every
[1:04:38] believer goes through a legalistic stage
[1:04:40] with their own doing their own doing
[1:04:43] their own doing but don't stay there
[1:04:46] then you got to go and do it's now it's
[1:04:48] his doing listen I don't try and be a
[1:04:52] Christian his life is the Christian and
[1:04:54] me I just yield myself and it's because
[1:04:58] I want to do it it's not a reluctance
[1:05:00] it's not a burden to serve God it's not
[1:05:03] a burden to be a Christian it's a joy to
[1:05:05] be a Christian it's a wonderful thing to
[1:05:07] be a believer amen
[1:05:08] its glorious have peace that passes all
[1:05:10] understanding joy unspeakable full of
[1:05:13] glory it's a wonder as a little animal
[1:05:15] thing bird is now a lighter brighter is
[1:05:18] my way
[1:05:18] what a glorious thing it was to take his
[1:05:20] yoke upon me oh I'm so glad to be yoked
[1:05:23] with you Lord isn't it glorious
[1:05:25] Amen it's not a burden why because he
[1:05:28] puts his Spirit within us and that
[1:05:30] causes us to walk in his statutes and
[1:05:33] keep them amen this is what we're cool
[1:05:38] to do now there's a life God's life if
[1:05:43] we have his life we have his character
[1:05:46] we have his nature we have
[1:05:48] his desires right we don't have our own
[1:05:50] desires their own nature own character
[1:05:52] those things that burnt out and he comes
[1:05:54] and dwells in us Amen so let's go to
[1:05:58] first Corinthians 13 how lujah a man
[1:06:10] who's been shattered with God in the
[1:06:11] secret place Amen to have constant
[1:06:14] fellowship with him now this is more
[1:06:24] than a nice wedding scripture first
[1:06:29] Corinthians 13 this is not when he
[1:06:32] speaks about charity we say well it's
[1:06:33] love it's more than human love amen
[1:06:37] Jesus loved the unlovable that was
[1:06:40] divine love I mean were you yet sinners
[1:06:42] when you were his enemy he loved you and
[1:06:44] died for you the scripture tells us he
[1:06:46] didn't love us because we loved him at
[1:06:48] first right he didn't oh they love me
[1:06:51] therefore I'll give myself a mere ransom
[1:06:53] for them no I'm gonna go redeem my enemy
[1:06:55] I'm gonna redeem those that actually
[1:06:57] hate me
[1:06:58] our carnal nature didn't like God this
[1:07:01] human nature were born with he doesn't
[1:07:02] like God it says in the scripture not
[1:07:04] 1:6 after him I mean doesn't matter what
[1:07:07] family are born and there's not one that
[1:07:09] seeks after him
[1:07:10] it takes God to move upon your heart
[1:07:11] that you would seek after him right so
[1:07:13] we were his enemy and yet he loved us
[1:07:16] that is divine love you don't love
[1:07:19] someone because they are good to you
[1:07:20] that's just human love
[1:07:22] right that's works if you show that you
[1:07:25] know that's law if you scratch my back
[1:07:27] I'll scratch yours that's law that's
[1:07:29] human love but even if you don't scratch
[1:07:31] my back I'll scratch yours anyway that's
[1:07:33] divine love hallelujah brother Bram uses
[1:07:37] that expression that's divine love
[1:07:39] divine love is it doesn't matter how you
[1:07:40] treat me I will still love you right so
[1:07:44] people say well I don't feel love
[1:07:46] anymore it's because they only have
[1:07:47] human love themselves and they are not
[1:07:50] in the Holy of Holies right hey it may
[1:07:55] sting but it does your good little
[1:07:58] brother parameter hey sometimes gotta
[1:07:59] sting I'm in battle do you good
[1:08:01] now I
[1:08:02] now I first cut the instead in one
[1:08:04] though I speak with the tang of men men
[1:08:06] and of angels and have not charity as
[1:08:08] divine love I become as sounding brass
[1:08:11] or a tinkling cymbal and though I have
[1:08:13] the gift of prophecy and understand all
[1:08:15] mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[1:08:17] have all faith that I could remove
[1:08:19] mountains and have not charity I am
[1:08:21] nothing and now I bestow all my goods to
[1:08:24] feed the poor and though I give my body
[1:08:26] to be burned and have not charity it
[1:08:28] profiteth me nothing charity suffereth
[1:08:31] long now if he's in you you have these
[1:08:34] attributes because it's his life and you
[1:08:36] right it's no longer I that liveth but
[1:08:38] Christ liveth in me amen you got to say
[1:08:42] that when you get up in the morning it's
[1:08:43] no longer I that liveth its Christ that
[1:08:45] liveth in me right charity suffereth
[1:08:49] long who's got long suffering and is
[1:08:52] kind charity envieth not charity
[1:08:55] vaunteth not itself is not puffed up you
[1:08:59] know someone that has ever seen wheat
[1:09:01] Grove when it becomes when it's not
[1:09:04] mature stands up like this look at me
[1:09:06] look at me look at me but when it
[1:09:08] becomes full of fruit wheat at valves
[1:09:11] when it's ready to be higher boughs it's
[1:09:13] bowing to the son that gave it life it's
[1:09:16] going to be the same thing with us if
[1:09:17] we're really a mature believer we won't
[1:09:20] be look at me look at me we'll be bowed
[1:09:21] our life will be a worship I mean to our
[1:09:25] God how lujah a man is not puffed up
[1:09:29] does not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[1:09:31] not her own is not easily provoked
[1:09:34] thinketh no evil rejoice us not an
[1:09:37] iniquity but rejoices and the truth
[1:09:40] beareth all things believeth all things
[1:09:43] hopeth all things endureth all things
[1:09:46] charity never faileth I'm so glad his
[1:09:48] love never fails but whether there be
[1:09:50] prophecies they shall fail whether it be
[1:09:52] tongues they shall see through that
[1:09:53] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[1:09:55] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[1:09:57] part but we're net which is perfect is
[1:09:59] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:10:02] done away when I was a child I spake as
[1:10:04] a child I understood as a child I
[1:10:06] thought as a child but when I became a
[1:10:08] man I put away childish things for now
[1:10:11] we see through a glass darkly but then
[1:10:13] face to face now I know in part but then
[1:10:16] I shall know even as I am known and now
[1:10:19] abideth Hope Faith Hope charity these
[1:10:22] three but the greatest of these is
[1:10:25] charity that should be in us right
[1:10:30] if divine love if he is divine love if
[1:10:33] he is in us then this character this
[1:10:35] characteristics will be in us we won't
[1:10:38] be able to help it right it's just like
[1:10:40] if someone you know without the new
[1:10:42] birth has a temper that can't help that
[1:10:44] temper flying loose they can't help it
[1:10:47] because it's in them there's a life in
[1:10:49] them but after they really meet God and
[1:10:51] God takes that from them I mean the
[1:10:53] tempers gone their venue nature well
[1:10:55] they can't have that temper again it's
[1:10:57] been taken from them we have real
[1:10:59] overcoming power right hallelujah
[1:11:02] isn't that wonderful he can take those
[1:11:05] things that you're born with amen and he
[1:11:07] can take them from you I mean that you
[1:11:09] can be dead and buried in Christ that
[1:11:11] your old nature doesn't come back to
[1:11:13] life again
[1:11:15] Allu you we're living in the present I
[1:11:19] pray you're living in the presence of
[1:11:20] the king amen
[1:11:23] now now there's two classes of people
[1:11:27] today I'll just close with this them
[1:11:30] same classes of trying to do something
[1:11:32] to save themselves each one say I'll go
[1:11:35] to church every Sunday that's very good
[1:11:37] I want to be religious that's very good
[1:11:39] they're still under the law but when the
[1:11:41] other by going to church and being good
[1:11:43] is not something that you do yourself at
[1:11:45] something and you doing it for you the
[1:11:48] Holy Spirit in your heart now notice in
[1:11:50] the center court these people that live
[1:11:52] inside here they seem to have always fed
[1:11:55] up always feeding good Ezekiel said I
[1:11:57] will write my laws and you and put them
[1:11:59] in their heart where the law used to be
[1:12:01] on stones in the Ark and the ark
[1:12:04] represents their heart represent then I
[1:12:08] will put my law in their hearts and the
[1:12:10] and the ark the people sorry the Ark is
[1:12:14] the abode of God and in the Old
[1:12:15] Testament God dwelt in its glory over
[1:12:18] the ark heart as the ark God dwells not
[1:12:20] in the head in the heart because not
[1:12:23] known by theology God's not known by
[1:12:25] mental conception God's known by an
[1:12:27] old-fashion sanctified born-again
[1:12:29] experience
[1:12:30] that's in the human heart yet men and
[1:12:32] woman live a good life and love God by
[1:12:35] mental conception but the real hiding
[1:12:38] places in the heart hid with Christ and
[1:12:40] when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into
[1:12:42] your heart he is and he is in you with
[1:12:45] your temperament and he's living his own
[1:12:47] life through his own well through you
[1:12:50] hallelujah I know it sounds awful but
[1:12:52] it's right Christ
[1:12:53] so yielded you are Christ speaks Christ
[1:12:58] speaks the kind of words he'd speak he
[1:13:00] thinks the kind of thoughts he had think
[1:13:02] through you he does the kind of works he
[1:13:04] would do through you you are yielded and
[1:13:07] resting what a beautiful picture of a
[1:13:10] consecrated Christian Amen yielded
[1:13:13] Christ working through he pulls it for
[1:13:15] me too for me to live is Christ and to
[1:13:17] die is gain I mean not me that liveth
[1:13:20] anymore but Christ that liveth in me
[1:13:22] Christ living in the individual soul
[1:13:25] surrendered Christ speaks through the
[1:13:27] lips and thinks through the mind sees
[1:13:29] through the eyes X through the
[1:13:31] temperament hallelujah that's the things
[1:13:33] of the world has passed away how can it
[1:13:36] be anything but sweet and pleasing all
[1:13:38] the time
[1:13:39] Christ has got control amen you see it
[1:13:42] that's what it is
[1:13:43] it's Christ in you Christ in you you say
[1:13:45] well you see I believe it to be the
[1:13:48] truth brother bear that's right that's
[1:13:49] here it has to come here amen
[1:13:54] that's the big thing where are you
[1:13:58] living today I'll just close with that
[1:14:00] where are you living today amen by their
[1:14:04] fruits you shall know them God wants us
[1:14:08] in here he wants us to dwell in here he
[1:14:12] doesn't want us in the outer court he
[1:14:14] doesn't want us in the holy place he
[1:14:16] wants us to dwell and the holiest of all
[1:14:19] the most holy place right that's the
[1:14:23] Christian experience I mean if we shut
[1:14:26] in with God the world doesn't matter
[1:14:29] amen jesus said what is it do they
[1:14:32] follow thou me to the disciples what is
[1:14:36] it to thee
[1:14:36] if the world's fallen you know whatever
[1:14:38] is going on out what is it to thee I
[1:14:41] mean what is it do they followed
[1:14:43] me you know the Apostle Paul if he was
[1:14:48] here and he gave a mission report just
[1:14:52] like brother Andy did about Vietnam
[1:14:53] it's that while I went to this city I
[1:14:56] preached I got beaten I got thrown out
[1:14:59] the gates and then I went to the next
[1:15:01] city and then I was rejected false
[1:15:04] brethren were there I had to run for my
[1:15:06] life
[1:15:06] whatever you you read his missionary
[1:15:08] journeys it wasn't all success as we
[1:15:11] would view but he said I was not
[1:15:14] disobedient to the heavenly vision years
[1:15:16] later after he met the Lord on the road
[1:15:18] to Damascus he came into the holy place
[1:15:20] he came into the presence of God and
[1:15:22] that God that he met came and lived in
[1:15:24] him and lived his life through him and
[1:15:26] he was a love prisoner to God and it
[1:15:30] doesn't matter what happened he said
[1:15:31] none of these things move me he's me
[1:15:33] who's been shipwrecked who's been beaten
[1:15:36] I mean who's been put in prison anyone
[1:15:39] here shipwrecked beaten put in prison
[1:15:42] who's had to run for their lives for the
[1:15:44] cause of the gospel who's had the
[1:15:46] problem of false brethren creeping in a
[1:15:48] you know unawares when he said he fought
[1:15:50] the Beast at Ephesus it wasn't animals
[1:15:53] in the arena he was fighting he sweetie
[1:15:55] he was fighting untamed people who are
[1:15:57] unconverted yet in the church right he
[1:16:01] said none of these things move me why
[1:16:03] because he was Shannon with God in the
[1:16:05] secret place amen he looked beyond the
[1:16:09] circumstances he wasn't living out in
[1:16:11] the outer quarter and they even and the
[1:16:13] inner court he was in the holiest of all
[1:16:15] he said none of these things move me he
[1:16:19] comes to the end of his ministry all
[1:16:21] have forsaken me yet he said I have a
[1:16:24] crown of life waiting for me what an
[1:16:28] incredible life what an example he says
[1:16:31] now these things movie and when we read
[1:16:34] about charity there it just wasn't an
[1:16:37] idea to him it was living in his life it
[1:16:39] was a reality now how about us if
[1:16:43] there's a man that could stand and that
[1:16:45] kind of against those odds but be
[1:16:47] faithful amen how about us now we said
[1:16:52] now these things move me right but the
[1:16:55] thing is the great secret is where
[1:16:57] living he was living in the Shekinah
[1:16:59] presence of God all the time the world
[1:17:02] was shut out he was eating from the
[1:17:04] manor I mean let's go to this got a
[1:17:07] revelation in chapter 2 real quick this
[1:17:10] isn't my notes revelations 2 and 17 now
[1:17:22] every we know that every promise to
[1:17:25] every age is added to the next age right
[1:17:28] he says he that oh heave it has an ear
[1:17:31] let him hear what the spirit saith of
[1:17:33] the churches revelations 2:17 to him
[1:17:36] that overcometh will I give to eat and
[1:17:38] the eat the hidden manna and will give
[1:17:41] him a white stone and in the stone a new
[1:17:43] name written that no man knoweth saying
[1:17:46] he that receiveth receiveth it now this
[1:17:50] hidden manner is the manner that's in
[1:17:51] the holiest place you've got to overcome
[1:17:53] to eat there to - to eat that manner
[1:17:57] right so you've got to overcome in the
[1:18:00] outer court let's just put that back up
[1:18:02] you've got to overcome here right you've
[1:18:06] got to overcome in here in the church
[1:18:08] you gotta overcome right and then you
[1:18:11] and then once you've overcome then
[1:18:13] you're grounded to come in here I mean
[1:18:15] where you can take up your cross deny
[1:18:17] yourself and follow him that's the
[1:18:20] secret if you can deny yourself deny
[1:18:22] what you think you are I mean when we
[1:18:25] come to a place where we just realize
[1:18:26] hey I'm just a Richard sinner and I need
[1:18:29] salvation you're in a good position I
[1:18:32] mean we don't come to God it's just like
[1:18:35] you know you know we don't come to God
[1:18:38] saying well I'm so great he has to save
[1:18:40] me because of who I am no it's out of
[1:18:42] his it's the goodness of God that leads
[1:18:44] to repentance
[1:18:45] it's His goodness it's not our goodness
[1:18:47] it's His goodness
[1:18:49] I mean but the problem is many times we
[1:18:51] look at him at the wrong way brother
[1:18:53] brand tells a story of a man who's who
[1:18:56] makes a sculpture of Jesus and then
[1:18:59] someone an art critic looks along comes
[1:19:01] and look at your your looks at it they
[1:19:05] see it there's nothing really that
[1:19:06] amazing about the sculpture and the
[1:19:09] artist says you're looking at it wrong
[1:19:11] he says you got to get down here and you
[1:19:15] gotta look up at it Laurie looking down
[1:19:17] it didn't look like much but then when
[1:19:20] he got down the right and the right
[1:19:21] state and looked up into the face of the
[1:19:24] Lord and that statue he saw the most
[1:19:27] beautiful statue ever made Wow it's all
[1:19:29] about your approach amen if you come in
[1:19:33] looking down saying well I'm obligated
[1:19:36] this is me I'm the bride I deserve it
[1:19:38] right you'll be out here that's right
[1:19:41] amen but if you come and say nothing in
[1:19:44] my hands I bring simply to that cross
[1:19:46] like glue I am nothing
[1:19:48] I don't desert we don't deserve it do
[1:19:51] you think we deserve eternal life Oh No
[1:19:53] hey bud mutters goodness that he gives
[1:19:55] it to us
[1:19:56] hallelujah that's his mercy I mean it's
[1:19:59] his grace amen when we were his enemy he
[1:20:04] died for us
[1:20:05] Amen he died for the ungodly that was us
[1:20:08] right and so if we come that way we'll
[1:20:11] be in here but the problem is now we can
[1:20:15] come in here hallelujah to the lamb and
[1:20:17] then we say now then we get all what he
[1:20:21] call it no we become all legalistic in
[1:20:25] our approach our heads get puffed up
[1:20:28] right I hear to get puffed up and we get
[1:20:31] stuck in the holy place amen and then we
[1:20:37] think well with a with a brightest and
[1:20:39] best know the Apostle Paul stayed a
[1:20:42] prisoner he stayed humble he stayed
[1:20:45] yielded you see the prophets life he
[1:20:47] didn't get less humble as his ministry
[1:20:49] went on he became more humble and more
[1:20:51] yielded right and that's how he must be
[1:20:57] that's why I say it's all the Lord
[1:21:00] salvation is of God right salvation is
[1:21:05] of the Lord so we have to come the right
[1:21:07] way Zacchaeus was the shortest man in
[1:21:10] Jericho it's like the shortest man right
[1:21:14] and in order to see Jesus he couldn't
[1:21:16] see him through the crowds he had to
[1:21:17] climb up a sycamore tree so he climbed
[1:21:21] up in the lowest city one of the
[1:21:23] shortest people
[1:21:24] look at the tree of life Jesus of the
[1:21:26] Tree of Life right but that was the
[1:21:29] wrong view he had to come out of the
[1:21:31] tree and look up look at Jesus Jesus
[1:21:33] would have been told with him and when
[1:21:35] he looked at him from the right
[1:21:36] perspective then he said if I've wronged
[1:21:39] anyone
[1:21:39] I'll repay them I'm gonna give half my
[1:21:41] goods to the poor and then Jesus says
[1:21:43] salvation has come to your house this
[1:21:45] day because of his approach right and if
[1:21:49] we can just get our pride out of the way
[1:21:51] amen get ourselves out of the way and
[1:21:54] what we think we are out of the way
[1:21:56] amen we'll do way way better I mean
[1:22:02] let's have the musicians please and you
[1:22:06] glad you think about that he bet just to
[1:22:10] come how lujah this is not a religion to
