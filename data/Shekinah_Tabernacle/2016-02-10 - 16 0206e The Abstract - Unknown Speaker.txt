TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and I wear pretty frail human beings really we we think we're tough but we're not really and the older we get the more we realize we're not very really that tough at all physically or mentally really but the Bible says he will keep him in perfect peace whose mind has stayed on him they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength now I don't know how these things work but when you do them they work and how that's all that matters if it works do it if God says it works it works so we're happy to be here tonight we've got a good um program on in terms of that I think the Lord is going to be present with us and feel welcome to be in our midst we've got um some good singing some items and we're looking forward to a good word tonight and I believe that we will all leave here better than the way we were when we came and and more closer to the Lord and that's what we're after amen now just before we get into it I've got a few announcements to make um the first one here we've got a there's a few little berries around that I think some of the little fellas were deciding might be good for lunch but I don't think that they are and um one of the sisters saw a little guy beginning to have a chew on some of these we took a photo of it you can't eat these things so if you're a little fellow don't eat these things they're laying around on the concrete and that sort of thing so they're a little red berry so little guys or parents look out for those things and don't eat them I mean um we've got the the dinner setup uh was a wee bit messed up so I think dinner was set to be said to be at 5 30 and then the guys preparing the dinner were there at 10 past five twenty minutes early but the dinner was actually five so the guy's preparing had to be there at 20 months before that so ignore the schedule dinner is at five o'clock so if you've got the dinner set up you've got to be there 20 minutes before that otherwise when you get there dinner's already being served and you didn't set it up if you didn't who did was it set up it's a all by yourself brother that's taking the taking one for the team amen um now the other one is the swimming pool um this is just for the Camp's sake I think today and I was the same we sort of left our children there and said to you know brother Andrew look after my children I'm going to go and go for a walk or something but apparently if your child's in the pool under 16 you have to be there looking after it you can't I can't just tell someone else to look after my child and I think half of the children in there there were probably four parents on the pool and about 30 children and I'm pretty sure they didn't have that many kids each hahaha so yeah that's just the way that the camp works if something happens then the camp is quite liable for that and brother Cuban asked me to bring the youth to the front but they're already here our surround sound system is here amen okay and now I'm going to ask someone to open a prayer this evening and I don't know who it's going to be but this is something I heard from Perry green when he visited New Zealand he said he went down to invercargill and he preached maybe at the Wharf he just preached and he said because the Bible says that after you've received the Holy Ghost you know go and bring this word to the outermost part of the earth and he sort of did his um geographical math and realize well if I'm in New Zealand I go down to there that's technically from where it was spoken that's the uttermost part of the earth so he thought he fulfilled the scripture uttermost part of the Earth and I think he might be right because we're a wee bit lower than um I think it's South America Chile and that sort of that but there so I want to find out here whichever brother is closest to the uttermost part of the earth you're going to pray so now if you're from South Island can you stand up and we'll just work our way down the brothers okay so anyone in there's a little town called I think it's Nelson Nelson can sit down is it is it you okay they know so is he the uttermost part brother Jason you're the outermost part of the Earth really has he really were they in

Lord as we are gathered in your divine presence this evening oh God Lord you said because there are two or three here that believe that you would come in the midst of us Lord I'm convinced father that

hidden from you you are the discerner of every thought and intent of every Heart Lord Lord you divide asunder between Soul and Spirit you make known your will and your purpose for our lives and so Lord as we yield ourselves to you we I just want Lord to let us go aside of any thought that I might have how this service would go Lord you know we've the people have had a full day they might be a little bit tired we've sung many songs we've listened to some wonderful specials but Lord we want to say we're never too tired for you Lord and Lord you know our endurance as far as what the human body can endure so Lord you just direct the service tonight the way that you would want it as our brother said out of the realm of human instrumentality or control May the Holy Spirit Lord may you just brood over us have your perfect way we ask your blessing upon the reading of the word and the hearing of it For Your Glory in Christ's name amen amen thank you musicians how many appreciate the musicians amount hey man let's take our Bibles and turn to the first Epistle of Peter I enjoyed the message this morning and uh brother Ben it seems like every time he got going on a vein he found himself uh strangely sidetracked that was me I had to stop him a few times lest he go in a direction that I was planning on going in tonight or tomorrow morning and uh and so I there was times where he started on a vein and I said I'm not saying Amen to that that's true but it's in my notes too the Lord has a mind for this weekend amen and we're so thankful that God is the one that's in control it doesn't matter who's standing behind the desk it matters who's standing behind the one that's standing behind the desk amen First Peter chapter one and let's read from verse 3 if we could blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead I don't want to carry on unless you miss that there because sometimes the Bible uses different terminology for the same phrase begotten us again means to be born again all right so he has birthed us again or we have been born again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead comma to an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you all right that word Reserve means preserved by guarding all right so there has been an inheritance that has been guarded all right but now we have come to the age where it is no longer reserved in heaven but now it has been claimed by the lamb who paid the price who alone was worthy to redeem the book what was the book it was the book that Adam lost and now has been claimed by the land back for the for the bride his bride the Bride of Jesus Christ who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed when in the last time what time are we living in the last time amen the Lord had his Blessing to the word you may be seated reserved in heaven revealed in the last time I want to speak about the revealed inheritance in our attitude towards the revealed inheritance because the inheritance and inheritance is not something that you earned an inheritance is something that was given to you by virtue of a birth and the Bible says here that we were begotten again to an inheritance many times people think well you know I just need to get saved and be born again and you know then I've Got My Ticket punched for the Rapture or I know that if I die I'll go to heaven because after all we want to be in heaven we don't want to be in hell and with and the same stands true tonight you want to be sure you make it to glory and you want to be sure you don't wind up in Hell there is a heaven and there is a hell am I the only one that believes that amen there is a heaven and there is a hell amen and so we realize that that's often where we go to as Christians but but now in the last days there's been a further revelation of the word as our brother spoke this morning the revelation of the sons of God that the whole of creation was groaning and travailing for all right something's not plugged in here you want to check that for me thank you we're there now testing yes you adjusted testing one two three is that better that's I can hear myself now praise the Lord no wonder you weren't saying amen put your hand over here and say we can't hear you brother Tim all right an inheritance reserved in heaven but revealed in the last time an inheritance that we didn't earn but an inheritance that we were born to not just born to be a Christian not just born to be be uh to make it to heaven but as our brother said this morning uh that we are the whole of creation was groaning and travailing waiting for what the revelation of the sons of God the time when the Revelation would come what it really meant for Sons and Daughters of God to really be in the mind of God because you know the Bible talks about it in the book of I believe it is job where God says to job where were you when I laid the foundations of the world tell me if you can where were you when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy God was describing something there and asking job if he could if he could know that in other words God said in my mind way back before there was a universe I saw the sons of God shouting for Joy I saw that there would come a time when in accompaniment to the morning stars that they would be rejoicing over the Revelation that I give them my sometimes we think oh it was an incident no it was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and God saw it there and God said to Job do you understand these things job didn't understand them but now in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all the mystery is finished amen and so here we are now we have we have come to the realization this is the hour of the revelation of the sons of God where God has revealed what it is to be an attribute of God manifested in this age praise the Lord amen is anybody excited about living in this age amen I hope you're not too tired tonight but it's so it's it's an inheritance now what it was it was something that Adam had that if we could fully realize what has been put into the hands of the Bride that it was lost by Adam by the Fall In the Garden of Eden and I know this is simple to most of you but it's just so we're all on the same page even though we got to be in one mind and one Accord amen and so is Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden it went didn't go into Satan's hands but it went into the hands of the original owner it went into the hands of God reserved in the heavens but in the last days Revelation 5 the lamb would step forth to claim the book to redeem the book John was told there was a voice that went out and said who's worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and to look thereong and then and John said there was nobody found worthy in heaven or on Earth or under the Earth and John wept because nobody was worthy now what a difference it was John weeping versus what God saw in the beginning when he said the sons of God shouted for joy now John was weeping but the angel said wheat not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and John turned and saw a lamb as it had been slain and he took the book and John rejoiced he says I Rejoice so much still Heaven hurt and that those that are on the earth hurt everybody heard I think we heard John's voice amen why because John was rejoicing just like God saw in his mind before the foundation of the world that when this Revelation is made known those that receive the revelation will rejoice now it's only in this last time as we said last night bride time not and uh we certainly heard this morning that the bride is taken from every age but not every age is the bright age only in the last time when the book is redeemed does the church change to bride form or in other words the form that all of them down Through the Ages wanted to get into really as brother Branham said we're an advanced Lutheran Church come on we're an advanced Methodist Church we're an advanced Pentecostal Church what has happened in the last days if Luther would have carried on he'd arrived at this point today if Wesley would have carried on he had arrived at this point today but it was reserved for his bride in this hour now let's just look for a moment back at the at what it was that was lost the inheritance as we look back at the Garden of Eden and brother Branham describes it in a couple of places and he says in the beginning the Holy Spirit began to brood over a bleak desert when there was nothing and had never been nothing but the Holy Spirit was sent from God not an intellectual see now he's saying it's it's a brooding of the holy spirit it's not an intellectual power that's why you know science today is looking to try and get to Mars to try try and create some Colony over there and try and try and put Humanity on there maybe reclaim Mars or something it'll never work because they're doing it by intellect it's got to be done by the Holy Spirit all right so the Holy Spirit brewed it over the Earth the Holy Spirit was sent from the presence of God to make love over the Earth and he stretched his big wings around the earth and began to make love or to brood coup over the Earth I can see calcium and potash coming together and a little Easter lily stood up the Holy Spirit brewed it out of the earth and he kept brooding and as he crude and brooded I began to see trees come up and birds begin to fly from the Earth animals begin to walk and he then he kept chewing and a man come up called Adam hallelujah what was God doing he was manifesting his thoughts he was expressing his love the attributes the predestinated attributes that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world you were in his mind before the foundation of the world and God couldn't live without you being manifested and that's why he did what he did that's why he made a creation that's why he made a universe that's why he brewed it over the Earth that's why he made a Garden of Eden that's why he put his son in that Garden of Eden because we were in his mind Hallelujah he had us in his thoughts Desiring to fellowship with us he says he goes on in power transformation 1965 he says now we find everything in order God spoke it he said let there be let there be and let there be a need and let there be beautiful flowers let there be my son in my own image stand over there in the Garden of Eden and let his bride stand by his side oh how beautiful what that was and the father he was a father you see so there come his own children coming forth and he made a paradise for them God loves to do things for his children we were represented there in the Garden of Eden the title deed that the lamb redeemed had our name on it but before the lamb redeemed it it was the hand of him that sat on the throne but before it was in the hand of him that sat on the throne Adam had it yeah so we were represented there in the Garden of Eden and our our the we were the thoughts of God that was expressed and put into the hands of Adam but Adam fell and so we came by the permissive will of God we came by the way of sexual desire rather than by the spoken word and that's why we have to be born again because that's which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit and so we were born first by flesh desire but then we have to be reborn and being reborn by the spirit of God that brings us back to our inheritance all right so I want you to catch now that down Through the Ages that man by the new birth since the book of Acts because we've been in a day of Pentecost since the book of Acts we've been in the Feast of Pentecost all down through seven Church ages the Holy Ghost as as Peter said on the day of Pentecost the promise is unto you and to your children and them that are afar off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and so there was a there's been a a baptism of the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages the problem was that it didn't produce what it was meant to produce and so they you see if they didn't have the Holy Ghost in any age then they don't have the resurrection but they had to have Resurrection Life to go into the ground and so brother Branham saying there was Holy Ghost filled Believers in every age and as that that comes and they're looking at that but the power of the Holy Ghost was bound by Creeds and dogmas down through the church ages now what that means is that it was bound by teaching all right now let me just um let me just read you something here brother random says if you've got the Holy Ghost he says the power that will raise us up is in us now we are now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection then he says if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters would create them a world to go out here and go live a private life on it that's how much power is in every holy ghost-filled believer how many Holy Ghost Field Believers We Got Tonight amen so the power that's in you is enough power to create because God created by Divine love that's the greatest power that there is that is the Holy Ghost as a prophet of God was caught on the other side and the angel told him said this is what you taught was the Holy Ghost this is divine love all right so Divine love or the Holy Ghost is the greatest power there is that's what comes into the Believer by the new birth all right so that coming into our lives puts a power within us that if there wasn't a law to it that we would speak a world into existence and go and live on it brother Branham says you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you got power to do it he says that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by Allah and that law is not the keeping of a bunch of Commandments it's a law of faith are you with me in other words it's governed by revelation and as much word as God reveals to you that's as much as you can believe that's as much of the power of God that is loosed right within the believer let me just stop here for a moment and say you've got enough of God if you get in you to heal every sickness you got enough power of God within you to defeat every devil but the problem is we get ourselves in the way you see it's actually it actually has to do with the clogging up of our Spirits or our minds the reasoning memory conscience imaginations and and those kinds of things why because in our mind is the greatest battle ever fought and the devil's objective is to try and clog up the channels through which God wants to bring the power of the Holy Ghost or the power of divine love but the object of the word is to clear those channels and lose the power of God within the life of the believer God has one objective and that is to bring sons of God to the power that they were always meant to be because what Adam displayed there in the Garden of Eden my Divine Love by Perfect Faith by by the power of an amateur Creator the second Adam came back and showed us once again then he was the love of God in the fullness of its power and he displayed what US of God was meant to be I wonder if it's at all at all possible to to turn it off because I that means I can't walk over here I just get blinded when I do it and I I Feel Like That Old Black preacher that brother Brown knew he saw a preach he says you ain't got enough room up here for me to preach praise the Lord he says he says that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by Allah oh it's gonna you're gonna turn that off well I'm gonna need that in a little bit so so now we have a paradox all right uh when I needed I guess you'll turn it on I'm sorry I shouldn't have said nothing he says that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's the law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours no he says whatever God will lead your soul to believe not whatever your flesh will lead your mind to believe amen a lot of people take take all things are possible to them that believe and try and put it in a fleshly context well praise God I'm going to believe God for a Mercedes or I'm going to believe God for a million dollars I'm going to believe God that I'm going to win the lottery that's just the flesh but whatever God leads your soul to believe because that power lays within your soul and it must come by the revelation of the word you won't find the revelation of the word giving you a Mercedes or giving you a million dollars or those kind of things now if you needed it God would give it to you praise the Lord I haven't met anybody yet that needed it matter of fact most people are like the Rich Young Ruler they need less of it praise the Lord you got a few amens on that I was scared I wasn't going to get any every place The Souls of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you if you're a son or daughter of God listen now if you're a son or daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there see that's what was a problem down through the church Ages was that their faith or their Revelation got away from the power of God that was within them you see the devil's desire was to take the word out of the hands of the people but God said in the last days I will restore saith the Lord are you with me so far now I always tell people when you quit pulling I'll quit preaching all right so as long as you pull I'll preach if you pull till two in the morning I'll preach till two in the morning all right and I hate to say it but I doubt you can do it but doubt your doubts amen if you can do it all things are possible to them that believe amen praise the Lord now brother Branham says Christ in Christ the mystery God revealed he says now what's a threefold purpose we realize God has a Redemptive purpose and he's had it down through six thousand years and we are the the fortunate ones that get to live in the last days at the climax of it all he says what's the threefold purpose to manifest himself in Jesus Christ to come into the body of Jesus Christ to have the preeminence to what restore back Eden bring back what was lost he goes on and says another place Christ the second Adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original Eden restoring back his bride in Fellowship back with God again as husband and wife to the Garden of Eden Christ and his bride all right I want you to notice that now because when as we're dealing with this subject we we deal with a marriage relationship because even as Paul said in the book of Ephesians chapter 5 he says I show you a mystery you see it's a mystery in the church the mystery of a husband and a wife the mystery of how the husband's the head of the wife he says and the and the wife should submit herself to the husband and the husband should love his wife and give himself for and the wife should honor her husband he says but I speak concerning Christ in the church amen it's a mystery to that age they were so close to it but it was still a mystery why because the full mystery would only be made known in the last days of how God would regard his church as his wife and all the rights that would be bestowed upon her because that because of an inheritance and because of the restoration that is given back to the church all right now you see the message did not come to reveal the messenger the message in the messenger are one you can't separate them when God sends a message he sends it by a messenger and so there's no disregarding or discounting the messenger but it but nevertheless it's that's not the reason that God sent the message it was not to reveal who the messenger was it was to reveal who this bride was amen the the commission of the messenger was like an Eliezer go and get a bribe for Jesus Christ and as the prophet of God takes that subject in end time messenger and end time seed sign and a couple of messages just before the opening of the seals he turns to his commission is to go and get a bribe just before the opening of the word comes to get that bride just before the very equipment comes to the message to go out he says he's looking for character a character that'll stand still long enough to be clothed by the Garment of the word and then he says Lord let another place says Lord let that be mine the crowning of my Ministry that you might allow me to dress your bride in the wedding Garment of the word and so as God's moving his thoughts he's moving his Prophet he's moving his whole plan now it's been unfolding down Through the Ages all that was in God he would pour into Christ all that was in Christ he would pour into the church but in order to come to the third part of his Redemptive purpose that is Christ in the bride like Adam and Eve would be United as husband and wife and they would walk out together in another Millennium time in the in another Garden of Eden Hallelujah that's God's purpose so what has he done in the opening of the word well the lamb comes forth we know Revelation 5 and I trust you if you don't know it you can read it or study it and it's the end time turning of events the Turning of the corner you know we're not building a wall God's not building a wall he's building a house and it takes you know anybody can lay bricks down but it takes a stone Mason to turn a corner and God sent a stone Mason in the messenger of the last age that would identify you see it's something's taken place in heaven and there's got to be somebody identifying it's got to be a prophetic Vision to identify what's taking place in Heaven by speaking it on the earth it's just like when the Book of Revelation was written it had to be a prophet go out on the Isle of Patmos to catch the unfolding of events in a series of visions and then identify them or write them in a book of Revelation it had to be a prophet that could see those things and then record them and in the last days it had to be a prophet to see the events of this hour and interpret them by speaking them on the earth that a bride would catch it and specifically that a bride would catch who she is it will bring a response in her because in Revelation chapter 5 the cry went out who's worthy to open the book and who's worthy to loose the seals and the lamb stepped forward and I'll just give you a couple quotes out of the breach message from my poor memory and a lamb step forth where did he come from he come from the eternities he come from his father's throne where he's been making intercession for seven Church ages but he's moved from his his intercessory work now he's moved into his claiming work because he's got a purpose in it his purpose is not to end up just claiming a bride his purpose is that he would Rule and Reign on the throne of David forever so he's coming from his father's Throne praise the Lord he's going to his own throne but there's a son of man Ministry in between and in order to accomplish that he's gotta he's got to come now and brother random makes a statement he says he cries with a loud voice says when a lion roars who is he is the lion of the tribe of Judah she identifies he opens the book he takes the book as the lamb but he was called The Lion of the tribe of Judah is that right but now he comes he changes form in morphe in Revelation chapter 10 he appears as the mighty angel it's Christ with the Covenant aimed with the Covenant rainbow over his head he descends from heaven and cries with a loud voice and when he cries with a loud voice the Bible says as when a lion roar what is he doing he's identifying himself I'm the lion of the tribe of Judah but he hasn't fully turned into that form so he's in a process now in these last days what is the process he's cried he's called he sent a message he's called for his bride to come stand by his side you see because according to the law of adoption his brother Branham explains it he says Isaac could not inherit everything that Abraham had until he was married Isaac was a type of the promised son and so Christ could not inherit all things until he takes a wife and so he comes from his father's Throne takes the inheritance opens the book calls for his wife to come stand by his side because she has joined heirs with him praise be to God now inheritance means a lot because in inheritance there's got to be an owner there's got to be someone take possession of it when God made the heavens and the Earth the Bible says God said let there be light and there was light God called the daylight the light day and the Darkness night and he and God saw that it was good God separated different parts of creation and he said second day it was good third day he made more things it was good fourth day fifth day begins to bring up botany life and animal life and all those things it was good it was good then the Sun the moon the stars it was good but then he made man and then the the Bible says as he made man there and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good why well how does it change from good to very good because man's here it's because God made an inheritance but when someone is there to possess the inheritance then it's very good all right so now if we go to Genesis or rather to Exodus chapter 3 we don't have to turn with me but God says to the children of Israel he talks to them about an inheritance we left them off at kadish barnia last night and and uh how that God was dealing with them but as they as God promised them this land he said to Moses I've come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land unto a good land a land unto a an a large and unto a land flowing with milk and honey and he describes that to them and then Israel comes out uh of Egypt goes through the Wilderness the 10 the 12 Spies went over and of course 10 of them brought back an evil report but Joshua and Caleb looked at it differently than everybody else God said it was a good land the tens five says it's okay but there's Giants in Walled cities in the land and we're not able to possess it but Joshua and Caleb they they said as they rent their clothes they speak to the children of Israel and these are the words they said the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land now what's taking place here's the ones to whom were meant to possess it and so they who had an inheritance God promised it to Abraham after he separated himself from lot lift up your eyes look to the north the South the East and the West I give you this land to you and to your seed and and and those that will come after you and so it was a promise it was an inheritance it was in the possession of the lineage of Abraham but now as they come in and spy out the land the ten spies don't look at it Through The Eyes of ownership but Joshua and Caleb as as Caleb later came back to Joshua and he said now Moses told me wherever my footsteps land I will have that as a possession Joshua give me my mountain amen it was an exceeding or a very good land for them because it was their land all right now the boy now down Through the Ages I could say it this way I guess this has been called the good book it's been a good gospel it's the good news that's what gospel means it's the good news but in the last days God takes the seal off the book in the last days God reveals the Mysteries that's hidden right within the book in the last days God brings it to the attention of the people and what does those people say Do they still say it's good news I say it's very good news I say this message is a very good message because it's not just anybody's message I take personal possession of this message this is not jeffersonville's message this was not William branham's message this is not a Church's message this is my message God wrote a love letter and he wrote it to me amen you've got to put your name there you got to claim it as a personal possession though a thousand fall on your right hand and ten thousand on your left it's not going to come now you because it's your land oh it's Marvel at the great warriors of Israel even to the modern era of Israel the great warriors that are in the land are the ones that say are not questioning if we can win the battle but how do we win the battle there's never a doubt in their minds saying oh I think we might lose this one no it's not a question of whether we win or lose it's just how are we going to win amen that ought to be the attitude of the Bride of Jesus Christ I mean we've read the last chapter in the book it's not whether we're going to win or lose we've already won because we're married to the mighty conqueror we are Mrs Mighty conqueror Hallelujah he's already won the battle and we're possessing it with them brother Bradham says it manifested sons of God he says now we're getting over into the book of Ephesians now the same way he's positionally placing the church where they belong Joshua placed them in the natural land now the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the land in the position that they belong in their inheritance amen so I want you to catch that now it's our inheritance so the Garden of Eden speaks of the marriage relationship that's what we're going to but we we're going to the Garden of Eden but we have arrived at the marriage of the Lamb all right we're not going to the marriage we're not in boaz's field anymore we are in boaz's house amen we have been pregnated by the word of the hour we have received the word and it is created life within me I was thinking brother Ben was preaching this morning on the grave clothes and I thought you know only those that are dead need Grave clothes and and the reason they need Grave clothes is to hold the body together because there's no life in the body and if they did wrapped tightly in the grave clothes excuse me for saying it wait eventually their arm's gonna fall off eventually the parts of their body are going to fall away I'll bet they so they wrap them up tight to keep that all in one like sarcophagus but those that are alive don't need Grave clothes it's the life that means we don't need it and the Life coming into the body means that all the denominational Creed and all of the things that bound the church before can all fall by the wayside why because the life has come into the church through a marriage Union all right so we have arrived at the marriage of the Lamb the lion has called for the bride to come stand by his side amen amen are you still with me and to have America doesn't mean to be in marriage all right I just want to just bring you a thought here how many married couples have we got here Tony can I use you and your wife versus apple would that be all right is your wife would your wife be able to handle that she's not too shy is she all right why don't you come right up here okay all right now what's taking place as I said is the marriage Union between Christ and the church it's not shining so come right over amen now as the as the as Christ is moving to his throne the Throne of David the Bible talks about in the Philadelphia Church age he that has the Key of David and those of you that are familiar with that phrase will know where I'm going with this but as the Key of David represents something because it describes in the Bible that the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder and None Shall shut and he and he shall shut and None Shall open and so this key uh which is represented by the son of David he said he alone has the use of the key for he alone opens and shots no man has the right but Christ himself but where is the key it's not in his hand it's not in his pocket it's on his shoulder all right so the shoulder represents something here and he and brother Branham goes to Isaiah 9 6 and says the government shall be upon his shoulder all right now catch this now because on the throne of David there's a government all right to him that overcometh in the last days will I grant to sit with me where in my throne all right so there's there's a transition that's taking place in the church now and he says what does it mean he says the phrase government upon his shoulder comes from the marriage ceremony of the East all right now sister this is clean all right I'm going to just give this to you for a moment this is a veil would you hold that now hold that just kind of so it partly covers your face don't let them see you now now we're just going to pretend you're not married yet okay and so there's a marriage ceremony of the East that has the bride is walked up the aisle or whatever way they did it in the East and she comes to her bridegroom now she has something that she has to do all right it's not all him he's paid the price he's a worthy man he's a Kinsmen Redeemer he fits all the types in the shadows but now she has the part that she has to play because this male represents something it represents the Virgin sea of the woman that she has kept herself from all other men and that's what the church has represented because they have had to have that attitude down Through the Ages and that attitude has been I'm keeping myself until the time that Christ Returns the churches staying pure the churches is staying uh apart but now she's come to a time in her life we'll go back to the Natural she's kept herself apart but she's coming to the light in the time of her life now that that attitude has to change she can't come to the marriage and come to her bridegroom and say don't touch me don't you come near me I'm keeping myself I've been taught all my life to keep myself don't you come near me that wouldn't be a bride would it that'd be a virgin all right but now in the marriage ceremony in the ceremony she would take this Veil and she would lay it upon his shoulder you may do that all right just like that and that brother Branham says represents something he says when the bride has been committed to the groom she takes off her veil and places it over the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under his Dominion that she has transferred her rights to him hello amen that's why we're liking unto Lambs all right we lay down ourselves willingly willingly be shared of all our rights and responsibilities and everything says she transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility all right now she's not just saying I give you my rights you're my head but now she's also saying you have a responsibility here you never had before amen you have a responsibility and the care he Bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone not her father come on when we when I I've married two daughters off so far when I walk those girls up the aisle and they ask the question who gives this woman to be married to this man and I say her mother and I do that's it my responsibility is over now I even say it this way Brothers if you want I often say to in marriage counseling I said you got seven years and then to blame it on the father what the woman is because seven years is a cycle but after seven years you've had the opportunity to mold her in your image she's all yours don't blame her family all right it's your fault what she is after seven years that's just the number maybe I plucked out of thin air but I think it has some background to it he Bears the responsibility and they care and he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility amen so she's signifying something here oh ketchup Saints may the Lord open our eyes to this when the bride comes down to the last days and she comes to the marriage Union let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come no wonder there's a rejoicing because now she's not wondering anymore he is the man see the man he is the man and because he is the man no other man has any rights no other man has any responsibility and no other power has any rights over her Amen in the church giving herself as a bride to Jesus Christ she's acknowledging no other power has any rights over me the devil has no rights over me the enemy has no control over my life anymore I am the Bride of Jesus Christ amen he says no other powers any right or responsibility that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he foreknew by Divine Cree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her let me make it personal he chose you she or you did not choose him he called her now she had a Rite of rejection he chose her she could have said no but she didn't that makes her the wife you could have said no but you didn't that makes you the wife amen and so she he called her she did not come on her own I wasn't looking for a message I wasn't looking for a prophet I wasn't looking for any of this but God came by my way and when he revealed his word to me then I believed him he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone she is Holy committed to him amen amen and he accepts the obligation amen and he and he is her head for Christ is the head of the church as Sarah called Abraham Lord don't use this too much when you go home even so the bride is happy for he is her Lord amen he speaks and she obeys because that is her Delight amen thank you brother Tony but I might need that God bless you thank you God bless you give them a hand isn't that wonderful see it's the attitude of the woman that has to change God's not interested in anybody he's only interested in his bride he has sent this message not for the world he has sent it for his bride all right now let me just let me just say this here now God is not interested brother Branham said in flirters all right do you know what a flirter is some do some don't all right some don't want to admit they know what it is all right I use this couple again just because I know that that they've been in the ministry so they won't be embarrassed sister um I forgot your first name Vicky sister Vicki Victoria no just Vicky all right sister Vicky I want to ask you a question all right don't be ashamed now is is brother Tony strong he is all right good for you man I got one more question for you is he handsome he is all right all right praise the Lord but now how would sister Vicki feel if some other sister came up and said to brother Tony brother Tony you're so strong and you're so handsome God bless you what would you think of that would that be all right now be honest wouldn't be all right would it you you it'd be okay okay all you sisters you got to go ahead no I wouldn't be all right would it no you wouldn't want some sister coming up and telling your husband how strong and how handsome he was why not that's a flirter yeah see it might be true but it's not their position you see they're not his wife she's his wife and she has the intimacy with him and so is it with denominations and churches that claim oh God is good that's true oh he's such a wonderful God yeah that's true oh his Bible is true yeah that's true but when the Mighty God come down in this generation and revealed himself making himself known then they look into the revealed word of the hour and say oh I don't like that kind of a god well that is the Lord Jesus Christ well my Jesus lets me cut my hair but my the real Jesus doesn't do that you see she obeys him because she loves him I remember when I first got married uh that I told my wife she was a nail biter you know what a nail biter is they bite their nails back and all the time and they're nervous type of people I says you know what one thing I hate in life is a woman with bitten off nails and she's and she said okay and she quit biting her nails what gave her the power to do that what entered into her life that never entered her life before there was a love that entered her life and love gave her power where she never had power before amen When Love Comes into oh I could never live like that the message is too hard it's not you living it it's love that comes in that allows you to live the way he loves you and there's many that say oh Jesus is so wonderful oh he lets me do this he lets me live any old way that I want to you know he lets me he lets me drink he lets me smoke he lets me go to movies all those kinds you know what I drink as much as I want to too I smoke as much as I want to I didn't go to movies as much as I want to which is to say I don't do those things because when his life and nature came into me I lost the desire of those things I could never overcome them on my own I was hooked to those things but God's love separated me from those things why because I am his wife and there's many people that look into the message of the hour and they don't like it because they think it's too hard it's some people think it's legalistic it's not legalistic it's love and they think it's this they think it's that they think oh you know they're they recoil it the Revelation that God gave in this hour but there's a bride of Jesus Christ that when the word come by your way they say that's the Jesus I've always been looking for amen that's the one that I'm in love with As He makes himself known to her she loves him more and more every day amen sister Vicky can I ask you another question when do you love him more now or when you first knew him now why it's a growth of a marriage relationship you you can pay me when we went later I call a young couple out in church at home just recently and and I was preaching on some of these things and and I said I called this young couple out and and I asked him some questions just like that and and they were just young you know just just married last year and uh one of the deacons stopped me after the service he says you owe them a supper I said owe them a supper they owe me a supper I said that was free marriage counseling my goodness then come to find out the brother come up to me later he said brother Tim that's the last time I ever prayed before a service Lord make this service very personal to me praise the Lord God is good amen now the power of the blood of Jesus Christ has not diminished one iota in 2000 years and it is not physical I don't have a vial of the blood here tonight but the life that was in that blood is in this room the blessings available to the believer has not changed in 2000 years the value of one Soul has not changed in 2000 years the ability of the believer to receive the blessings of God has not changed in two thousand years God's attitude towards the believer has not changed in 2000 years all of these things remain constant and remain the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you see a a church that neglects any part of this word has to by Nature say God has changed because they can't live the book but God has not changed in the same life that they saw in the book of Acts is the same life that's on the scene today matter of fact when I was a young man I was raised in a denominational church and uh I always run away even though I felt called to the ministry in the church my uh my uh my family has a long line of ministers dating back all the way to early days of Pentecost and and I felt kind of a pull towards the ministry but I run away from it because I knew that I didn't have what they had in the book of Acts I believed it I believe the Bible but I didn't have what was in the Bible I didn't have what they had so I always run away they always tried to put me and Slot me into different things and I always run away from it and finally God brought his word by my way and that changed my life you see it takes the revealed word of the hour to Quicken the elect of the hour and only the elect of the hour can be quickened and so as God quickened Me by his word then I used to walk to work every day and and uh listen to a message in the little town where I received the the message and I won't go into all the details of that but I would walk to work and and listen to a part of a tape and walk home and listen to a part of a tape after work and back and forth and and so one day I was walking to work and I just came up a side street and turned around I was working in a bank at that time and turned around to go down to the bank and and as I was walking down just a half a block from the bank God spoke to me while I was listening to that table and he said you said you would preach what I've given you the truth I've given you the truth and so I knew I could no longer run away from the call that God had given me you see God is in the business of doing things the same way he did it in the Bible his his attitude is the same he hasn't changed it must remain the same or he's not God he has one purpose that is redemption and that purpose of redemption has always been contained in that title deed God did not change the Plan of Redemption he did not have a plan B as we know even through Moses life and we can see how that Moses uh run away from the call of God because he tried to do it in his own pal run out in the desert but God didn't call somebody else he just molded Moses on the backside of the desert till he got him in condition that he could use him so it is with every son and daughter of God that God will bring you into the right position to receive the word and to manifest the word in his hour you see it's only the attitude of the believer that has changed down Through the Ages nothing else has changed God's plan isn't changed and God's revelation in these last days is to get our attitude back towards his word back on track the attitude of the sons of God well let me just say this brother random takes it specifically towards a mental attitude here and he says he says may I go on record now saying this that I believe that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise will bring it to pass Jesus said the word is a seed that the man sowed he was the man that sowed it and the seed put in the proper conditions in a Heart full of Faith it'll make every promise live bring forth what is promised he says another place he says it's your personal property the very minute that you receive it that way then it has to come to pass all right now in brother brannon's Ministry the thing that he struggled with was the attitude of the people towards the healing that God wanted to give them see brother Branham Discerning the secrets that was in the people's hearts never healed them they were already healed at Calvary come on these are these are basic principles in the scripture he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed amen all healing was paid for and completed at Calvary but it's our attitude towards the promise that has to be changed and God's in the business of changing our attitudes and so there might be somebody that brother Brandon would have to call out see God just revealed whatever was necessary brother Branham being the vessel that God would reveal it to to change the person's attitude he might tell them something that they went through as a young person he would he would he often said you know if I need to know what's wrong with you he says I contact your spirit where is it whatever is wrong with you is in your spirit what's your spirit it's your mind the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise will bring it to pass so if a prophet of God could reveal where the problem is in a person's Spirit he could change the attitude changing the attitude would loose the power of God that's already there into their life and produce the healing that they were Desiring see it wasn't something that they needed to work themselves up into young people faith is not an emotional workup it's not something that you've got to build yourself up into faith comes by hearing the word as you receive the word of God it builds a substance within you and all it takes for the Holy Spirit to strike that substance will produce the promise see some tried to work themselves up into Faith by emotion that didn't work matter of fact emotion doesn't build faith it hinders faith one time brother Brian went to a place and I don't know why these are not in my notes I don't I'm going down this road I'm sure it's for somebody he went to a house one time and he comes into the house of girls in a real bad shape little girls very early I think it's in the message faith is the substance around the earlier messages and he says that the girl was in a very bad condition and the father he says he says was about to cry and he said to the father very straightly he says Don't Cry says it'll hurt your faith what is it what see it's not a human emotion is the result of something that God does human emotion does not attain unto God Esau sought a place of repentance with tears and found it not you see it takes a revelation within the heart to produce faith so many times people tried to work themselves up to you know Miracles don't produce faith Miracles actually hurt faith I'll explain that one to you it's all right you know Israel came through the Wilderness there wasn't anybody that saw more miracles in his room the ten plagues The Parting of the Red Sea they saw water they received water from the rock as I said yesterday they ate Manna From Heaven they they saw plagues strike they saw different things happen supernaturally in two years they saw so many miracles that they had no excuse but when it came time to enter in what was the problem the word was not mixed in their heart with faith it wasn't that they hadn't seen enough Miracles you see in the early part of brother branham's Ministry he believed that Miracle lines would help the people's faith and he was actually rebuked by the angel of the Lord and told don't have those Miracle lines because it'll come to pass that people won't believe unless they see a miracle now is that increasing Faith or is that decreasing faith no he was hurting the people's Faith by trying to produce Miracles night after night faith comes by hearing what the word of God that's the only way for you that faith is for God to drop his word into your heart right I think I better finish that subject I thought I would leave that till tomorrow a man come to Jesus one time come to the disciples oh I think we better read this take your Bibles and turn to Mark chapter nine are you still with me all right you're still pulling praise the Lord no I've done that to somebody Mark chapter 9 and verse 19. we find the the man that brought the the epileptic case to the disciples and they couldn't cure him and uh we'll pick it up at at verse 16 he says what he asked the scribes what ants questioning you with them and one of the multitude answered and said master I brought unto thee my son which has a dumb spirit and where's whoever he taketh them he teareth him and he formeth and gnashes Away with his teeth and pineth the way I speak to thy disciples that he would cast them out they would cast him out and they could not and he answered and said oh faithless generation how long shall I be with you and how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straight away the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed forming see the devil likes to create a distraction trying to try to distract the service distract from what uh because that's why people fall sick in the service because the devil's try to create a distraction I've had it happen you know children fall off chairs hit their heads on the floor whatever more everybody was like they've never seen a child fall before amen amen everybody feels sorry the devil knows how to do it Lord willing to speak on atmosphere tomorrow or maybe Monday it says and he asked his father and he said how long is it ago how long is it ago since this came on to him and he said of a child and often It cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou can't do anything have compassion on us and help us and Jesus said unto him if thou can'tst believe all things are possible to him that believeth it's a famous scripture that we quote and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou my unbelief now this is a powerful scripture because it actually loses the secret of faith because here the man is it appears to be contradicting himself Lord I believe help thou my unbelief but in his anguish to see the power of God he was willing to admit something and that was that he didn't have enough faith because he's actually saying if you go back to the Greek he's saying Lord I believe help thou my lack of faith now Faith is not believing and believing is not faith you believe with the faith that you have but believing is what you do with the substance that you have faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen but you believe with that Faith you in other words you focus that faith upon the promise of God it takes you to take the faith and do something with it you see the disciples even wondered why they couldn't do it and Jesus told them because of your and he uses the same word lack of faith it's not that you're not believing they believe for this and believed for that and they had enough Faith oh you say brother Tim is it really a lack of faith listen brother branham's wife sister Mita had a tumor and in her latter years a latter years of brother Brown's Ministry rather and uh it came up against it because of something that she had done wrong and the Lord didn't like it and so she the little cyst that she had on her ovary began to grow into a tumor and you know the story became very big and they come to the end of it all where brother Branham they were putting off the surgery putting it off putting it off and finally he said to he said to his wife he says dear I guess we don't have enough faith for this now can you imagine brother Brown was saying that see sometimes in life you come up against something and the problem is you don't have enough faith faith comes by hearing the word that's why it's so important to receive the word what God is doing with the revelation of the hour is building you up into the faith of a Son of God because it is the faith of the Son of God deposited into the heart of sons of God to reproduce that faith in a bride okay so faith is only a revelation that's why the Bible says when the son of man cometh will he find faith on the Earth and so the man that was that was crawling out here he was at being identified I don't have enough Faith Lord I'm believing but help thou my lack of faith maybe you're here tonight and I really don't know why I'm on this subject but really there's enough power within the believer to speak worlds into existence but what operates that power is faith and faith is a revelation that only God can give faith cannot be conjured up or done by you that is to say believing is not faith we are believers that's what we do we believe but faith is a finished work faith has muscles on it when Faith speaks the devil shuts up I'm just giving you little statements right out of the message of the hour Lord let there be a deposit of Revelation brother Brown says the importance of Revelation cannot be overestimated amen we've got to realize why God is bringing his Revelation into the church now as I said before this inheritance can only come to you by being born again but once you're born again then God takes and moves you to a realm that he supplies everything that you have need of through the title deed of The Inheritance that the lamb has redeemed now see you've got to have the Holy Ghost and the title deed a lot of people don't understand that it's because you can be in the message of the hour and actually understand that the title deed is back in the hands of the Bride but if you don't have the Holy Ghost the devil's just going to laugh at you and you can have the Holy Ghost which is what they had down through seven Church ages but without knowing what's on the title deed you don't know what's available to you through the power of the Holy Ghost that lays within you so it's not just the title deed and it's not just the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the abstract to the title deed all right now you can put that slideshow up for me I want to explain to you for a moment about the abstract title deed and then maybe Lord willing will bring this to a close depends if you're still pulling or not yeah now is that me that's making that noise I do sorry turn on the pulpit mic all right stay at the pulpit is what he says all right quit wandering around all right you got me back for that so the abstract title deed I wanna you can put the first quote up there as we talk about what it what we're talking about here now it says in whom you also trusted Ephesians 1 and verse 13. after that you heard the word of Truth I'm going to read it off my notes Here the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance all right notice it's not our inheritance it's the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession oh my now just hang on a second Redemption what's God's Redemptive plan there's only one that could redeem and that's Christ until he redeemed the purchased possession that's Kinsmen Redeemer and so when the lamb as a Kinsmen Redeemer takes the book out of the hand that of him that's set upon the throne that's the inheritance that's the purchased possession all right so the church has had the Holy Ghost as an Earnest of The Inheritance until the time that the lamb steps forth and the time of the Redemption of the purchase possession unto the praise of his glory and so now what is brother Branham uses the term abstract and I want you as we go through this I want you to understand abstract is actually an American term I don't know if you have it here in New Zealand it's not something we use in Canada which is similarly based on a British system the abstract is a is a real estate term and it's related to a title deed but it's not the title deed and his brother Branham explained it what you would do if you're buying a piece of land it has a title but you would have to go and obtain an abstract and what the abstract does is searches the title all the way back to when the title was established and make sure that there are no prior claims all right so you can have the title deed but if you don't have an abstract to show with the title deed you cannot enforce the title deed somebody might say I have a claim on that but when you have an abstract with the title deed you could present it to the judge and say I have a right to this title because the abstract says there are no prior claims to this title that I possess all right so now give me the the first quote please now brother Brown I'm talking about the day of Pentecost he says now here was men fishermen Tax Collectors humble Little Women just ordinary Housewives little virgin girls they were believers they were believing that this was the truth they believe that when Jesus died they believed on him and Rose up again from the dead they believed that to be absolutely the testimony of God and that he had quickened him God had quickened him Christ to life now they go up to the day of Pentecost to receive their abstract you know what an abstract is it's when the deed has been cleared next page he says God gave Abraham a promise Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the Covenant by the Seal of circumcision and God gives you a promise potentially that you will receive it and you're going to be raised up and this body is going to be glorified with them at the end time but you see you have to get a clearance on that deed and the clearance was when everything against it has been stripped off and you've got the abstract to it you've got the seal it's yours everything on it belongs to you just hold that there for a moment and so brother Brandon these two quotes are speaking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the believer has to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you can get a deed but you've got to get the clearance to the deed but when you've got the clearance you've got the seal it's yours everything on the title deed belongs to you that's what they went for at the day of Pentecost God sent down the abstract they walked out of the upper room with the abstract everything on the title deed belonged to them there was only one problem the title deed had not been redeemed yet dude partially they had received a revelation in their age you say oh brother Jim if the book isn't redeemed how could they have a revelation of anything that was on the book well when Elijah was in the cave and complaining I alone am laughed the prophet of God said God pulled back the cover of the seals a little bit and let him see there was still seven thousand that had not bowed their knee to bail what was it the names written on the book you say and so is it in every age the partial Revelation is the names that are written on the book until the last days when God finishes all the mystery and brings the full inheritance into effect all right let's just continue to look at this give me the next one message rising of the Sun he says like the Pentecostal experience today and the coming of the Holy Ghost in This last days was promised is like the abstract to a title deed he says now you can get a title sure you can get a title to a place but that don't say it's yours no sir somebody way back Yonder should come in and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract that shows that everything that's ever against it is struck off plumbed back from the foundation and he says is that right I'm telling you that's American law and when Amanda said he believes the word and then when the Holy Spirit comes it is the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have the abstract that every bit of that belongs to you and everything that's on it belongs to you all right now it's not a signification that you believe what's on it you believe even before you get the abstract but what happens when you get the abstract it proves ownership it proves that it belongs to you that's why the woman at the at the seraphenician woman that come to Jesus she had a revelation or how God had to pour Revelation into this woman listen it had to come by faith because she's come to Jesus and she says you know oh son of David have mercy on me my daughters previously mixed with the devil won't you please deliver her and and and Jesus doesn't even say anything because she had no claims on him as that and so then she says oh son of David have mercy on me and he says it's not me to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs is that the statement all right now what he's saying is this belongs to the children why are you trying to lay claim on it but God drops a revelation into our heart and she says truth Lord now she changes her approach it's not son of David now it's Lord and she says but even the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table now here's a couple of Revelations that God drops in on our heart and this is more Supernatural than sometimes we even realize how that God pours into her number one don't be offended that you're called a dog come on she doesn't run away and say I'm not wearing no she knew she needed what she needed this man had sometimes we have to realize we you know we're in such an instant age we want God to give it to us instantly well you know we're so used to I hate to say it I don't mean to pick on young people but maybe I'll just look like this so I don't know look at the young people I got eight children myself I still got two children at home and you know that they're glued to these things right everything's got to happen instantly they they want to text and get a text right back and and all of this everything's instant instant communication is that right somebody give me an amen you don't have a phone you don't have a phone God bless you my daughter was just like you my daughter was just like you growing up she says Dad everybody in their dog has a phone I said well if you need a phone borrow the dog's phone so here is the Sierra Phoenician woman and and God struck her heart excuse me for saying that but and so she she's catching a revelation now and catch what the woman is actually catching because in the if you look back in the underlying Greek words the the word Lord and Master is the same word and so she's actually saying truth master but even the dogs eat the crumbs from their master's table what she's saying is I may be a dog but I'm your dog Hallelujah tell you what she caught a revelation I may be a doormat Lord but on your doormat I may be a nobody Lord but I'm your nobody amen as our brother said this morning I might just be the one at the back of the orchestra with a little triangle but Lord I'm in your Orchestra you're my conductor and whatever you say I know that the devil has to listen to you praise the Lord that woman caught a revelation and Jesus says I have not found so great of faith in all of Israel she had a revelation of who she was and she laid claim on her part and Jesus couldn't help but heal her her daughter was healed from that very hour Hallelujah why Faith to walk in the light that God gave her Glory say what brother Tim God's only were just revealed to me that I've been saved and walk in that life God's only revealed to me that you know I've just been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord walk in that light please revealed to me just a little bit well walk in that light well you see you're not going to see the whole Revelation all at once you just walk in the light that he gives you and then you become like this woman whose record is recorded in the Bible for our benefits amen just like the little woman with too much she said all I got is these two mites but I'm going to give God everything I have and Jesus stood there he never stopped her he allowed her to give it and he said she's given more than everybody else now I know why the Lord spoke to me the other day and share this testimony with you now now I've come to it I used to think about well everybody thinks about the lottery ever thought about the lottery hey you're honest God bless you we've all thought about the lottery what would it be like if I won a million dollars they had just one in the United States a billion and a half dollars it's just I you can't even think in those numbers I can't anyway I didn't buy a ticket by the way and uh and I've never bought lottery tickets since I've been saved matter of fact why I had one given to me and I gave it to somebody else what would people think if a preacher won a lottery you know and so and it wasn't a winning ticket anyway so uh I was driving by on the way to our camp last a couple summers ago where it was a youth camp and I was going to speak be speaking to the youth in the morning about missions and and things and and so I as I uh was on the way to Camp you know I I pulled in for some gas at the gas station saw the sign on the window lottery so many millions of dollars and I don't remember what it was and I thought Lord you know the numbers to that Lottery what numbers would win how come you never tell nobody what those numbers are yeah if you I didn't say if you told me I'd give it all but I said you know if you told somebody that you could trust they win the lottery and give it all back to you and I thought about that you know when I'm thinking about it on the way to camp and I'm I'm pondering over it and then all of a sudden something speaks down in my heart and says remember brother so and so and there's this brother that is is actually he was in an automobile accident and he's got physical injuries because of it he's not in very good physical shape but he goes out and collects tin cans and bottled cans and bottled uh or pop bottles and pop cans and that kind of stuff and cashes them in for money and gives the money to missions and he sends me letters and I write him back and he might only send five dollars or ten dollars and I write him back every time he sends a few dollars and uh sends me a letter tells me how he's doing and his name's Jeff he sent me his testimony and how God dealt with him and he was actually on the radio and because of it and and so he just a very positive man and the Lord spoke to me says if I allowed somebody to give that amount of money he says then brother Jeff would not give his offerings because he would think he wouldn't need to and then and then where would be his reward that's why God operates the way he does that's why he said about the Widow with two mites she has given more than all the others because they out of their abundance have given but she out of her poverty has given all that she has don't ever forget that when you're giving to the Lord there you go all you pastors that's for free amen so he says all my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out by the blood of Jesus Christ we're still speaking about the abstract and the Holy Ghost is come as an abstract to the title deed that God give me by grace by foreknowledge the title deed is the inheritance we didn't do anything to deserve it it was in God's mind before the foundation of the world but now he's given us the abstract to it next one please say I bought a piece of ground I want to Anchor this in your hearts I bought a piece of ground it isn't yours until you got an abstract but if you got an abstract it shows that everything that ever was against that piece of ground has been stricken off and then when you become a Christian and accept Christ as your savior then when God sends down the abstract listen to this now it shows that no matter what your father did your mother did what anybody else did your mother Daddy might have been drunkards prostitutes I guess that does away with illegitimate birth doesn't it whatever it was every sin is stricken off you've got an abstract title there's nothing can put you off of it and look everything that's on that ground belongs to you and when you're in Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost every gift of God belongs in the church it's an abstract title deed it's yours it belongs to you and then he says it quickens your mortal body all my if we think of it all right so that's the abstract it shows up there's nothing against you all the way back whatever you ever did wrong you got the Holy Ghost it's all been stricken off there's there's the grace of God I was wondering where I was going to put this in all right the grace of God I'm gonna flip this now I told you I was going to follow the lord tonight I'm gonna stop in the middle of that slideshow and I'm going to open another one called expectancy I was waiting to know where where I was going to drop this in but I want to introduce you to two men and the grace of God and maybe maybe this will help you are you still with me get a little quieter we'll close as soon as we can hey man you recognize this man on the right that's brother Biscoe but I want to introduce to this man on the left is uh Brother Thompson Alfred Thompson Brother Thompson uh uh he uh I'm gonna have to read it off the screen because I don't have it in front of me because I didn't think I was going there tonight but he came to us while we were in Tennessee just this last November and he told Brother bisco I want to share my testimony with you brother Alfred Thompson said I was in I was in brother branham's meetings in 1950 I think it was three says he was 22 years old add that up I think he's six he's 80 something now 70 something 80 something and he said I wasn't supposed to be in the meetings he says but he says my friend persisted with me to come to the meetings he says and I told my friend this is what he's telling us in the room here he says I told my friend I'm not coming I'm not interested the friend kept persisting he says I'm not interested he says I I because I think that I've sinned away my day of Grace I've gone too far and I I I I God's not interested in me so don't even ask me again and as the meeting came close the Holy Spirit moved on him he just said something moved on me and and he he says he decided at the last minute to go into the meeting give me the next page please now here's the actual this instance it's recorded 1953 November yes November the 8th which was exactly the day that he told us the testimony November the 8th so it was exactly what is that 62 years later all right he says how brother Brown says how to do sir there's something strange about you sir Satan has desire to take your life you're all Torah you think you've sinned away your day of Grace you think your life is ruined do you love Jesus what makes you love him man obviously said yes before there could be anything to their make you love him there has to be a Creator to create the love in your heart is that right if you'd send away your day of Grace you would hate Jesus but you love him and you're all right and the devil's just lying to you brother random doesn't know him he's telling us the story he said he said matter of fact he stood in the room and he said I was about to do this that was his description he was about to commit suicide he says and the devil's just lying to you you're nervous come here and I'll cast him away for you if you'll believe do you believe it he says bow your head and keep your heads bowed everyone till you hear me say raise up this is demonology almighty God be merciful to the boy he stands here and Satan's trying to get him to get in this condition to commit suicide but Thou Art here to relieve the boy and to make the evil spirit go how did Brother Branham know he was going to commit suicide what was it God came by his way to make the evil spirit go thou has said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they'll cast out Devils then upon the authority of God's word as a Believer I now ask the spirit that's on the void of unbelief to leave him go out in the name of Jesus Christ bother him no more and I set him free and may the enemy be bound and leave this room and torment no one else in Jesus Christ's name amen now you're all right now you can raise your head feel all right now son is that right devils you'd have committed suicide in a few days that was on his mind he thought he'd send away his day of Grace and when he come up a real black heavy like fog meeting me in the face that's devils the boy is free now feel happy go on home rejoicing thanking God for his goodness to you God bless you amen what took place the grace of God came by his way the holy spirit says I'm not done with you yet it doesn't matter what the devil's trying to tell you was just a boy 22 years old he was 85 in the room 63 years later 62 years later 84. he was just a young man but he had thought he'd gone too far God's not interested but he asked him one question he said do you love Jesus I talked to a young person the other day and I just said you know person that had thought you know there's no hope for me I said do you love the Lord yeah do you love his word she said yes I said you see you're a daughter of God you see you wouldn't say that if you weren't a daughter of God there's something in you that you love the word because the word loves you amen see it's never never too late and it's never too far I want to show you one that's even worse here I've never met the second one but it's quite a testimony brother Brown's in a prayer line and he says yes sir brother you have trouble with arthritis is that what it's what is what bothers you isn't that right see the way you get around I want you just to look this way and be just as sincere as you can life hasn't been a flower bed of ease for you has it brother had lots of Sorrow lots of trouble you're in trouble right now isn't that right brother isn't that right yeah at one time you wouldn't have come in this prayer line you as an unbeliever once very much critical of religion isn't that right you've done a great thing along that time too something that hurt you I believe you rebuked God or cursed with God or something or done something wrong or didn't you how would you think brother by the spirit of God is that a tract concerning it now hold it right there just for a moment I just want to gather your thoughts here around this here's a man comes in a prayer line and brother Brandon begins to discern this man has cursed God this man has got trouble because of it and he's suffering because of Any suffering the effects he's paying the price for what he did sometime previously now most of us as ministers would say we're not touching this one they're saying that's between you and God really you know what what I can't help you you curse God that's between you and him but notice how God's Prophet take picks it up here give you the next one he says now concerning that it harmed you now being that you had that on tracks then look this away believe with all your heart he says you paid dearly for that brother you have lots of troubles now nervous you have a lot of Home troubles don't you domestic troubles with your own home is that right will you believe me as God's servant it's all right for me to speak what the Lord says now he's asking him a question and the man's got to say yes because if he doesn't say yes brother random will not make the next statement you've had other troubles too don't you sexual troubles is that right sexual troubles that's the only place in the message you'll hear brother call brother brother Bradham call somebody out with that is this man that's just my opinion but I think God allowed that to make the man suffer a little bit because of he had cursed God all right but watch what God's going to do for him here is that right sexual troubles you listen what I mean nobody but God Alone knows that better than you is that right you believe me with all your heart brother let me have your hand says let's bow our heads our heavenly father there's nothing but what you know all about it I'm so thankful that you're here tonight blessing this poor old brother now obviously this man is old suffered from what he did when he was young having run and slip away to get to the service so he snuck from where he was into the service because he's actually a skeptic he's actually published a tract as you'll see in a moment that says I curse God he says is there a god I cursed him is it was the title of the track he says Granite Lord he's in trouble or he says let me go back this poor old brother having run and slip away to get to the service but loves you in his heart after all this God reveals to his Prophet this man loves God he says God make a way for him granted Lord he's in trouble he said that you said that you would be near those that are in need God bless my brother now as I bless him in thy name may all these troubles clear up like a cloud leaving from before the sun and may he be healed tonight of his arthritis and all these other troubles Lord listen Saints if God will heal a man like this of arthritis don't you think God will heal you of arthritis Hallelujah if you've got the abstract to the title deed don't you think God wants to give you what's rightfully yours here's this man that did all that he did he says Lord and me made a whole new and hold tonight in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I ask it amen it's another part he says look here brother let me see you you feel that you're healed don't you you are healed my brother God bless you and go on your way rejoicing and all your troubles are going to clear up now and be all right God bless you amen that's the end of it you can go read those for yourself here's a man both of them probably thought they went too far but God come by their way you can go back to that other slideshow please God come by their way why because there's something written on a Lamb's Book of Life that is Unstoppable there's a title deed that belongs to the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't know whether these fellows are in the bride but I know that God has an elect that have more rights than we might even say these men had a right to expect in their day but God came by their way and God will come by your way I want to spend just a few moments on these now what is the title deed Father Brown says it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my oh what are that to do to a born-again Christian it's legal possession to the abstract deed title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost next one now watch the title deed of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he's come to claim it back for the human race not claim it back to Angels claim it back to the human race which it was given for to make Sons and Daughters of God again bring them back to a Garden of Eden now there's where we started at the beginning what is the Redemptive purpose of God all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into the church that in the last days he would unite the church in Christ in a marriage Union and they would walk out like Adam and Eve into another Garden of Eden amen bring them back to a Garden of Eden everything they lost the whole creation the trees the animal life everything else now we're getting over into a book of Ephesians now the same way he's positionally placing the church here's the quote that I read already where they belong now Joshua placed them in the natural land now the holy spirit is placing the church positionally in the position where they belong there inheritance amen that's what the title deed is it's a it's the revelation of all that always belonged to you tomorrow I want to deal with sons and daughters of God specifically and what that means but now let me just wrap this up here with just a few thoughts did you know that what God actually came down to do by his message in this hour is to change our attitude towards what he's done for us it's a change of attitude that really needs to take place in the body of Jesus Christ brother Branham makes a statement in this in the seven trumpets of the Feast of the trumpets he says he says the seventh trumpet is to Israel what the seventh seal is to the bride and that's a key Revelation because if we understand that you're still with me all right I'll try and wrap this up in the next 10 minutes here so just stay with me I'll say like one brother actually the brother is preaching at our camp right now in Cloverdale he says I'm about to close you know what that means it doesn't mean I'm closing yeah I'm about to do that though all right I just said that to lighten it up to make sure everybody was awake all right so now here the seventh trumpet is to the Jews what the seventh seal is to the Gentiles and if we know what the seventh trumpet means the Feast of the trumpets is the calling of Israel to the day of atonement all right the day of atonement is when the sacrifice is made for all the sins of the nation in the Old Testament and it was done annually but there was a greater sacrifice that came the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world one sacrifice for all that's why you know if if there's somebody here struggling I would simply ask you do you accept what Jesus has done for you it's not what you have done it's what he's already done for you and so Jesus Paid the price but the Jews didn't recognize it but the Feast of atonement in the Old Testament is only a type of the day of atonement in the tribulation time that Israel is called to by the seventh trumpet and so the seventh trumpet calls them to the day of atonement but it's not a new atonement they don't receive another sacrifice rather it brings their attention to the fact that the sacrifice is already paid you see they've been living for two thousand years since the day of the Gentiles started and the day of of God dealing with the Jews ended until the tribulation time they've been living under an attitude that they're looking forward to the Messiah they're looking forward to what God's going to do missing what he's already done for them back there but under the ministry of Moses and Elijah in the tribulation time God will actually change their attitude he will change their attitude because it's they won't give him a new atonement but he will show them it's already done for them and they will receive this same gospel that you and I have received so if the seventh trumpet is a change of attitude the seventh seal is also a change of attitude by the opening of the seals God comes down and reveals you always were us of God you always were a daughter of God and he brings the title deed down to show all that Adam and Eve lost is in the hands of the Bride now and if you bring the abstract with the title deed nothing can stop you claiming from what is rightfully yours it's already yours because God has already given to you that's the extreme joy of the hour brother Branham said in the Mighty God unveiled he says since the Holy Ghost has come in these last days is prophesied and the veil has been rent too many people hang to their traditions to try to hang to their traditions of the fathers and that's why they can't see this extreme joy and peace and things that the church has today yet it is in plain view of those who believe Hallelujah it's in plain view now I know that I know it's really waning here just pinch yourself five more minutes because we've come to an hour where it's actually the marriage of the Lamb the bride has made herself ready we've come into position to be United to the word why because the word has revealed we are his wife the word has revealed we are no longer church we are bride we are no longer just Sinners saved by grace we are Sons and Daughters of God made in the image of God come back with the Holy Ghost abstract to apply to the title deed to say everything in this book is mine it's no longer just a preacher laying hands on you yeah is no longer a prayer line you can have them if you want it's no longer just an altar call they're all right in their place sometimes we need those things the scripture says anoint them with oil and all of that that's perfectly all right but let me tell you something you have the rights you have the title team if you have received this message and you have received the Holy Ghost you've got the abstract title to eat to push the devil back off your inheritance say devil you got no rights on my inheritance you're a squatter why don't you tell him tonight devil you're a squatter you've been trying to tell me I need this sickness I don't need this sickness you've been trying to tell me I'm bound to these complexes I don't need these complexes you've been trying to tell me that because of my family or because of the way I'm made no my parents my grandparents my great-grandparents it's all wiped off by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I got the abstract to apply to the title deed and the devil has no rights in my life I can say that no other man no other power as any right or responsibility over my life because I have come into marriage Union with the Lamb of God the devil is defeated rising of the sun brother Bradham says all my sins are struck out all your sins are struck out by the blood of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that God gave me my Grace by foreknowledge and then he says oh my what are you scared about no wonder he said fear not I am he that was dead and alive again and I'm Alive forevermore and have the keys of death and Hell that's what we preached on last night who is he he's your bridegroom who is he he's your beloved he's the one that's in love with you and he's the one you're in love with he says in the Patmos Vision he says Don't Fear John don't fear little flock put your name there all that I am you are heir to say hallelujah says all that I am you are Heir too I say Amen Lord I said I'm putting my name there Lord I don't care what the devil says no more I'm putting my name in your word I believe you sent this message as a love letter to me personally he says all my power is yours that's why it gives you the Holy Ghost that's all his power it's laying right Within You by the Holy Ghost it's not something you got to go get it's already in you if you got the Holy Ghost amen you just need to claim what is rightfully yours he says my omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst says I have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability Hallelujah receive his love receive his courage and receive his ability he says all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and I will perform it that is my Covenant and it can never fail Hallelujah who is he is the Covenant angel that descended with the book open he says this is my Covenant and it's all yours I give you the power I give you the word you speak it and I will perform it let's stand together tonight Hallelujah Hallelujah I wonder why the musicians are coming because our heads are bowed there's only one one way the devil can defeat you and that is if you don't have the abstract if you don't have the Holy Ghost the devil will just laugh at you but you don't have to stay there you just have to lay yourself on the altar with the sacrifice that God gave and say I want to be identified with his sacrifice tonight as our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed I wonder if there's somebody that would be just desirous enough to say Lord I need your Holy Spirit Lord I heard the power of it and I know that I need it more than anything else oh God and I'm willing to surrender everything that I am now surrender is an action all right it's an action that you got to raise your hands and the attitude behind your hands has to be like a wife to a husband I submit myself to you Lord it's why the Apostle Paul said about marriage it's really a mystery concerning Christ in the church when the church comes to that perfect surrender God sends down the Holy Spirit the abstract that gives her a right to every blessing in the word would your brothers just play I'm amazed that you love me as your hands are raised your eyes are closed I want you to say Lord I want you more than anything else I want you to speak to him tonight I want you to ask God because you know I can I can have you come up here and lay hands on you but it's not me laying hands on you that gives you the Holy Spirit don't fall back with God anymore say Lord I'm here and you're here and I want you to come and fill every fiber of my being with your presence tonight let's bow our heads together and pray Heavenly Father Lord you see the hands that are raised tonight oh God Lord you see the identification that is in the midst of your people Lord we have labored in your word tonight Lord we've desired to follow the leadership of your Holy Spirit but lord it's not up to me to open up people's hearts Lord it takes the Holy Spirit to do that father and you have spoken to them by your word and you see the hands that they have identified father Lord I need you Lord I need you in my life I recognize that there's a title deed that's mine but now Lord I need the abstract of the Holy Spirit to enforce the title deed upon the enemy I'm tired of dealing in a defeated life I'm tired lord of the Heavenly trampling Over Me Lord I'm not looking for an emotion but Lord if it's emotional that doesn't bother me I'm not looking for some kind of a sign but if you send some kind of something that won't bother me I just want what you want long I say not my will but thy will be done Lord we're praying that with all of our hearts and as we sing this song and as we open up our hearts to you I pray Lord that you'd feel your children Quicken their hearts with your
