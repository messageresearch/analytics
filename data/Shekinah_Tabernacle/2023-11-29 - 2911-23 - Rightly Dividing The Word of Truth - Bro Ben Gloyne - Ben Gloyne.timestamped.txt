[21:13] Second Timothy
[21:17] 2:5 amen everyone's happy to be a
[21:21] Christian today good I'm glad
[21:24] amen amen Jeff and B are doing real well
[21:28] it's great to be with them over there I
[21:29] know's bet amen she's doing real good so
[21:32] amen and David consulted with the
[21:34] captains of thousands and hundreds and
[21:36] every and with every leader and David
[21:39] said unto all the congregation of Israel
[21:40] if it seemed good unto you that it be
[21:43] that it be of the Lord Our God let us
[21:45] send abroad unto our Brethren everywhere
[21:48] that are left in all the land of Israel
[21:49] and with them also to the priests and
[21:51] the Levites which are in their cities
[21:53] and suburbs that they may bring
[21:55] themselves unto us and let us bring
[21:57] again again the Ark of our God to us for
[21:59] we inquired not at it in the days of
[22:02] Saul and all the congregation said that
[22:05] they would do so for the thing was right
[22:07] in the eyes of all the people so David
[22:10] gathered all the all Israel together
[22:12] from seor to Egypt even unto the
[22:15] entering of hemo to bring the Ark of God
[22:17] from kilma Jerian and David went up and
[22:20] all Israel to uh B uh that is to uh kth
[22:24] J however however you say that which
[22:26] belongeth to Judah to bring up then the
[22:28] Ark of of God the Lord that dwelleth
[22:31] between the cherubims whose name is
[22:33] called on it and they Carri the Ark of
[22:35] God in a new cart out of the house of
[22:38] abinadab and USU and a drave the cart
[22:41] and Israel and all sorry and David and
[22:43] all Israel played before God with all
[22:45] their might and with singing and with
[22:47] Harps and with potteries and with
[22:49] timberl and with symbols and with
[22:51] trumpets What A procession but it was
[22:54] done
[22:55] wrong 2 Timothy 2:15
[22:58] says here study you don't have to turn
[23:02] or you can if you want to but I was
[23:03] going to read it study to show thyself
[23:05] approved unto God a Workman that needeth
[23:07] not to be ashamed rightly dividing the
[23:10] word of Truth and i' like to speak about
[23:12] that tonight rightly dividing the word
[23:13] of Truth amen so let's just bow heads in
[23:15] a word of prayer tonight shall we as we
[23:17] go before the Lord Lord Jesus we're so
[23:20] thankful we can sing hosana to the lamb
[23:22] that was slain dear God so thankful we
[23:25] can Praise Your Name Lord Jesus you
[23:27] truly you are the king of kings and Lord
[23:28] of lords and we just want to thank you
[23:30] we can gather together in this manner
[23:32] one more time we just want to pray Lord
[23:33] that you'll take over the service Lord
[23:35] anoint each one Lord Jesus we've read
[23:38] your great Eternal Word Lord we need you
[23:40] the author of the book to come and open
[23:42] it to us Lord speak to our hearts Like
[23:44] Only You Can may you grant it for your
[23:46] glory Lord we want to remember those who
[23:47] couldn't be here tonight be their
[23:48] portion as well Lord those who may be
[23:50] watching Lord by the way the stream Lord
[23:52] Jesus touch their lives too we submit
[23:54] ourselves under your Mighty hand Lord we
[23:56] love you and we thank you in Jesus Jesus
[23:58] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[24:00] you may have your seats tonight so as I
[24:02] saying I want to speak about rightly
[24:04] dividing the word of truth it's
[24:06] absolutely essential that we that we
[24:09] divide it rightly because if because if
[24:11] there's if Timothy was told to rightly
[24:14] divide it there's a then it's quite
[24:15] possible to wrongly divide the word of
[24:18] Truth to actually come out with the
[24:20] wrong outcome now this this rightly
[24:23] dividing it's it's actually one word in
[24:24] the Greek and it means to make a
[24:27] straight cup that is to dissect to
[24:29] expound correctly the Divine message to
[24:32] rightly divide it and we must as
[24:35] individuals now this is not this sounds
[24:36] like maybe a bit of a ministers kind of
[24:38] a sermon but this is for all of us to
[24:40] rightly divide the word of truth because
[24:42] we need to take the word ourselves and
[24:44] rightly divide it you know we can't put
[24:46] the wrong emphasis or the wrong
[24:48] interpretation on the word we're going
[24:49] to stay exactly with how the word is has
[24:51] been spoken and how the word has been
[24:54] written now it's amazing when you you
[24:56] can go study uh trying to do God a
[24:58] service without his will your brother
[25:00] bar preaches it a couple of times and
[25:01] you know he goes to this portion of
[25:03] scripture here with David and it's
[25:05] amazing how David you know the uh David
[25:08] consulted the wrong people I'm just
[25:10] going to kind of paraphrase it bit down
[25:11] but you know he consulted the captains
[25:13] of thousands and hundreds and with every
[25:15] leader so those with influence he
[25:17] consulted but he didn't consult the
[25:19] right one he didn't he didn't he did not
[25:21] consult Nathan the prophet the word of
[25:23] the lord always comes to the prophet so
[25:25] he consulted these ones and because of
[25:27] David's influence and it sounded like a
[25:29] good idea because who would not want the
[25:31] Ark of the Covenant in your city I mean
[25:33] if we're Israelites we would want the
[25:35] ark we would we we wouldn't want it in
[25:36] some foreign land we would want it in
[25:38] our in our city amen because we know the
[25:40] ark represents the word he wanted to
[25:42] restore the word back into Israel and
[25:44] but you see you see he consulted the
[25:46] wrong one and and you know and and but
[25:50] the thing is this influence Came Upon
[25:52] all the people as it says in verse four
[25:54] there and all the congregation said that
[25:56] we would do so for the thing was right
[25:58] in the eyes of all the people but the
[26:00] thing is he put it on a new cart he
[26:02] didn't he didn't carry it the ark was
[26:04] not carried how the word said it should
[26:06] be carried you know we must be very
[26:08] careful that we stick with the word
[26:10] that's been revealed it's absolutely
[26:12] essential that we don't deviate from it
[26:14] add or take away from this message but
[26:16] we stay with the word of God as a church
[26:18] as individuals as families it's very
[26:21] important because there's power in this
[26:22] word and if you want the power of God to
[26:24] live through your life get back to the
[26:25] truth amen not to because David no doubt
[26:29] he saw the ark was already on a cart the
[26:30] Philistines put it on a cart and maybe
[26:33] he thought this is how it should be
[26:34] carried but he didn't consult the word
[26:36] to see the right pattern of it and so he
[26:38] he he copied a denominational idea and
[26:41] and unfortunately that brought death
[26:42] where it should have bring Life coming
[26:44] into Israel it brought death to a
[26:46] sincere worshiper that didn't want to
[26:48] see the arc topple we know that user
[26:50] died because he tried to steady the Ark
[26:51] of God and so Timothy is told to rightly
[26:54] divide the word I say unfortunately
[26:56] though David was a was a Son of God he
[26:59] was King he was an in his an adopted
[27:01] position of God you know he sincerely
[27:03] loved the Lord he did not rightly divide
[27:05] the
[27:06] word amen so you say what because people
[27:09] might think well we can't get into this
[27:11] mess well we can if David can we can so
[27:15] we don't want to get into that kind of a
[27:16] mess amen but you I know I'm looking at
[27:18] a room of sincere people here you know
[27:20] so you know but the thing is we don't
[27:22] but David was sincere he was sincere you
[27:24] know they played with all their might
[27:26] this was not just a ual oxen walking
[27:28] down the road towards Jerusalem this is
[27:30] playing and trumpets and singing and
[27:32] dancing and would have been prepared and
[27:34] there would have been great enthusiasm
[27:36] going along in that in that group there
[27:38] would have been a real atmosphere but
[27:39] yet it was done wrong now brother Braham
[27:42] says that you know what it comes to any
[27:44] anything of the Scripture it says if a
[27:46] prophet or a dreamer or whatever it is
[27:47] or a teacher hasn't based his theory
[27:50] exactly on thus sayith the Lord I don't
[27:52] believe it see it's just a theory unless
[27:54] it's tied in with God's word unless it's
[27:56] from Genesis to Revel ation is just a
[27:58] theory and we're not here to express
[28:00] theories you can go to Victoria
[28:02] University if you want to hear theories
[28:04] we're not here to listen to theories we
[28:05] here to listen to thus sayeth the Lord
[28:07] am me that's why we worship God because
[28:09] we want to Worship in spirit and in
[28:10] truth not in spirit and in theories but
[28:12] spirit and Truth amen this is what this
[28:14] is the father seeketh them to worship
[28:16] Him in spirit and in truth so we're not
[28:18] here to approach god with theories we're
[28:21] here to approaching on thus sayith the
[28:22] Lord he says it's got to come right back
[28:25] here from Genesis to Revelation not just
[28:27] one place it's got to come through the
[28:29] Bible and tie exactly together yes sir
[28:31] it's got to dovetail with the rest it
[28:33] and hook it all together if you don't
[28:36] you could take one thing and say that
[28:37] there's purgatory and preach Catholicism
[28:39] out of the Bible but it's got a dovetail
[28:41] completely from Genesis to Revelation
[28:43] make the picture clear that's right so
[28:45] David had an inspiration to bring the
[28:47] ark into the city but his in but but his
[28:50] inspiration didn't tie from Genesis to
[28:52] Revelation see it doesn't matter how
[28:54] real inspiration can be like brother bam
[28:56] was asked about about water baptism for
[28:59] example and someone asked him did the
[29:00] angel of the Lord tell you that because
[29:02] because the person said we believe the
[29:04] angel of the Lord and brother bam said
[29:05] if the angel told me anything different
[29:07] to what the Bible said it wasn't the
[29:09] angel of the Lord and I wouldn't believe
[29:10] him it's got to be in the Bible First so
[29:13] you take any inspiration it doesn't
[29:14] matter how fantastic how great it may
[29:16] seem how real it may appear it's got to
[29:18] be in the word and not just one point
[29:21] because remember they wanted the ark
[29:23] because the Bible says you know God
[29:25] built the ark in the Tabernacle that God
[29:26] would dwell among his people so no doubt
[29:29] David would have known that he says I
[29:30] want God to dwell Among Us so he had
[29:32] that one bit of inspiration but he
[29:34] didn't follow the whole word of God
[29:35] where the ark would be carried correctly
[29:38] amen so so and it brought death into the
[29:40] camp see it's got to every Revelation or
[29:42] every theory has to dovetail one
[29:45] scripture to another all tied
[29:48] together am mean CU we want a clear
[29:50] picture I mean we got a clear picture of
[29:52] Jesus Christ in this day we don't have a
[29:54] muddled bunch of theories or a group of
[29:56] men trying to approach God and work it
[29:58] out with their intellect now God has
[30:00] revealed himself in this day we know who
[30:02] Jesus Christ is we know that he is the
[30:04] Lord God Almighty we know the right
[30:06] approach to him we know what pleases him
[30:08] and displeases him it's not a gray area
[30:10] anymore God's taken the Gray Away the
[30:12] light Shan amen and light white is white
[30:15] and black is black what right is right
[30:17] and wrong is wrong amen so we want to
[30:20] make sure we're building our lives
[30:22] correctly on the word of God Amen
[30:24] because remember that the that the you
[30:26] know we're built upon the foundation of
[30:28] the Apostles and the prophets Jesus
[30:29] Christ himself being the Chief
[30:31] Cornerstone amen so we're building a
[30:33] building amen we're not building a wall
[30:35] we're building a building amen and we're
[30:37] all individually built up into the image
[30:38] of Jesus Christ the statue of the
[30:40] perfect man so so we must be built
[30:43] according to the blueprint right and me
[30:45] we can't you know it's just like um for
[30:47] example you know every building is built
[30:49] with a with a with a map with a design
[30:52] with a plan in mind now you can't start
[30:54] on a foundation and build a different
[30:57] thing and say it's right so for example
[30:59] maybe with these guys it's just a
[31:00] picture but maybe just say for argument
[31:02] sake this is a this is a uh toilet and
[31:05] the bathroom and everything so the
[31:07] foundation has been mapped out as that
[31:09] maybe just say for argument sake you
[31:11] know the piping and everything the
[31:12] plumbing and everything underneath that
[31:14] Foundation is for a bathroom but then
[31:16] the builders decide we're going to build
[31:17] a dining hall on top of this thing well
[31:20] well what's been built on the foundation
[31:22] doesn't match the foundation you see so
[31:24] the word of God whatever the foundation
[31:26] is what's built on it must match it it
[31:28] can't deviate it's got to be the same
[31:30] thing it's like brother Bram said many
[31:32] times I'm just touching the highlights
[31:34] have you heard him say that you're
[31:34] diging into it he says there'll be young
[31:36] people come will dig into this and make
[31:38] it live amen so what's built upon the
[31:40] word or built upon the message is not
[31:42] different to the foundation amen it's
[31:44] like people start off like like it's
[31:46] very easy people can take quotes and
[31:48] scriptures and they end up with a dining
[31:50] room instead of a bathroom when the
[31:53] foundation's a bathroom so for example
[31:55] how the Bible says we should not be une
[31:57] yolked right so so that's the foundation
[32:00] but then people can say I don't want to
[32:02] build my life upon that and say well I
[32:04] could win them to Christ and then like
[32:06] the Philippian Jailer call upon the name
[32:08] of the Lord and thine and thy house
[32:10] shall be saved so they take scriptures
[32:12] and quotes and twist it to make their
[32:13] own ends and they don't have a bathroom
[32:15] they've got a dining room you're
[32:16] following me right we want to whatever
[32:18] the foundation is we going to build upon
[32:20] that amen so whatever the foundation is
[32:22] the building matches the foundation amen
[32:25] amen we got to be careful how we build
[32:28] it's either hay wood and stubble that's
[32:29] that's all man's ideas it'll be burnt in
[32:31] the fire or is it gold and precious
[32:33] stones is it Revelation built upon built
[32:36] upon it remember because theory is just
[32:38] idea and we should never even preachers
[32:41] should never preach ideas we should
[32:43] preach Revelation whatever is real
[32:45] should be preached amen if it's Theory
[32:47] we'll just say it's Theory and start off
[32:49] with that that's fine but it shouldn't
[32:50] be Theory it should be a revelation am
[32:52] mean so the word must become real before
[32:54] it can be manifested I mean before it
[32:56] can be preached amen like just like
[32:57] brother R when he preached sermons they
[32:59] weren't sermons they were Revelation it
[33:01] was divine revelation being preached to
[33:03] be received into a body of people and it
[33:05] would manifest the word amen that the
[33:07] word that was preached would put on
[33:08] flesh amen because we know that the
[33:10] prophets of old did not decide what to
[33:13] say that's right they did not say Moses
[33:16] did not say thus sayith Moses or thus
[33:18] saith Paul or thus thus sayith Peter or
[33:21] James or John no they were moved by the
[33:23] Holy Ghost that's why it says in second
[33:26] Peter 1 it says knowing this verse that
[33:28] no Prophecy of the scripture is of any
[33:29] private interpretation so it's not well
[33:32] I've studied this out I've worked it out
[33:33] therefore it's my interpretation or this
[33:36] group over here no because for the
[33:38] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[33:40] will of man but holy men of God spake as
[33:43] our moved by the Holy Ghost amen that
[33:45] that's how that's how the that's how the
[33:47] prophecy of the scripture came men of
[33:49] all were moved am mean when Paul would
[33:51] be sitting in jail writing he was moved
[33:53] upon by the spirit of God and whatever
[33:55] the spirit gave him revelation of he
[33:57] wrote down and sent to the church is
[33:58] amen what brother BR preached wasn't his
[34:00] own idea he says this is not my own idea
[34:02] it was God's word being being spoken
[34:05] amen so if it's God's word being spoken
[34:07] then we can build our lives upon it amen
[34:10] because it will dovetail with the
[34:11] scripture you know some people have gone
[34:13] off say we don't need the Bible anymore
[34:15] no we do need the Bible we've been
[34:17] returned back to the truth of the
[34:18] scripture I me we've been returned back
[34:20] to the pages of the Bible amen the bride
[34:22] is in the word amen hallelujah this is
[34:25] who we are so we're not running off with
[34:27] one idea you see denomination starts
[34:29] with a good idea they run off on a
[34:30] tangent instead of staying with God and
[34:33] God revealing more see if the lutherans
[34:35] just stayed with the just shall lived by
[34:36] faith and kept walking with God and God
[34:39] unveiled more than they would have
[34:40] become the methodists and there would
[34:42] have been a Methodist Church who have
[34:43] still been Lutheran or even the
[34:45] Catholics if you go back a bit further
[34:46] if they stayed with god with the
[34:48] original revelation of the word the
[34:50] Catholic denomination would never have
[34:51] been birthed because they would have
[34:53] stayed with God and then then then the
[34:54] Reformation would never need to have
[34:56] happened because the the truth would
[34:57] have stayed but they ran off with Theory
[35:01] and we don't want to run off with Theory
[35:02] cuz theory has dead ends with still
[35:05] births and no reality of God and so we
[35:08] don't want that kind of thing we must
[35:09] take every Revelation that we say we
[35:13] received and take it back to the
[35:14] scripture amen if it don't line up with
[35:16] the scripture put it in the recycle bin
[35:19] and hit delete
[35:21] okay amen now brother Brown was asked
[35:24] one day it's interesting how this in the
[35:27] unveiling of God he says when someone is
[35:29] um so someone was saying to him a
[35:31] theologian brother Braham if if the Lord
[35:33] God said if you with your experience
[35:35] that the Lord had given you for his
[35:36] people humbly saying this said you would
[35:38] have be you'd be eligible to write a
[35:40] Bible yourself your word if God has
[35:43] manifested I said that might be true see
[35:44] he was trying to catch me see I said but
[35:47] you see I couldn't do that he said why
[35:49] couldn't you you have all the
[35:50] qualifications I said but you look one
[35:52] word cannot be added or taken away and
[35:56] he said well then them seven Thunders
[35:58] you see he said wouldn't them seven
[35:59] Thunders blasting out wouldn't that be a
[36:01] revelation that was given to some man I
[36:03] said no sir it would be adding something
[36:05] or taking it um be adding to it or
[36:07] taking something from it it's all
[36:09] revealed in there he's speaking about
[36:10] the scripture and the Seven Seals opened
[36:12] up the revelation of that of what it
[36:15] that was that's what it was see it's
[36:18] still in the word you see you can't get
[36:20] out of that word you can't leave the
[36:22] word and God's spirit will never leave
[36:24] that word it'll stay right with the word
[36:26] blinding some and opening the eyes of
[36:28] other it always does that amen so any
[36:31] true revelation will stay in the word
[36:33] you know it's the spirit of God CU it
[36:35] takes you back into the entire scripture
[36:37] not just one isolated Point
[36:39] somewhere amen I trust I trust you're
[36:42] following me tonight am mean see this is
[36:45] very important we just just we don't run
[36:46] off on a tangent somewhere because it
[36:48] feels good I mean David would have felt
[36:50] pretty good dancing with all his might
[36:52] and playing and everything it would have
[36:53] felt really good but yet the ark was
[36:55] carried the wrong way it was an actually
[36:57] a an antichrist move there because it
[37:00] wasn't according to the word and
[37:03] anything that's Antichrist is actually
[37:04] against the word it looks like the word
[37:06] but it's not the word it's not the full
[37:08] word of God we're going to stay with the
[37:10] entire word of God Amen it's very very
[37:13] important amen Isaiah would say to the
[37:16] law and to the testimony if they speak
[37:18] not according to this word it's because
[37:20] there's no light in them so you got to
[37:22] speak according to the word amen if
[37:24] remember if the spirit The Same Spirit
[37:26] that inspired the prophets of old to
[37:27] write the Bible comes into you amen you
[37:30] will speak according to that word cuz
[37:32] the same author cuz remember the first
[37:34] five books of the Bible aren't moses'
[37:36] writings they're God's writings through
[37:38] Moses Isaiah's writings we call it the
[37:40] book of Isaiah but it's God's writings
[37:42] through Isaiah Jeremiah all them down
[37:44] through the you all of the all the
[37:46] prophets it's God writing through them
[37:48] speaking through them it was recorded
[37:50] the same thing in the New Testament era
[37:52] so the spirit of the the author of the
[37:55] book comes into you the Holy Ghost ghost
[37:57] then you will speak according to the
[37:59] word amen you see now David was
[38:02] inspired he was inspired to do what he
[38:04] did but his inspiration wasn't checked
[38:07] with the
[38:08] scripture he see David and God could
[38:11] talk to Hezekiah of course but he um but
[38:14] but he made certain channels you
[38:15] understand it God has has has his own
[38:17] set way of doing things sending revivals
[38:20] talking speaking whatever it is he has
[38:22] to he has his way of doing it and we are
[38:24] nobody to tell him how to do it he does
[38:27] it the way it pleases him to do it so
[38:29] you see David being inspired now
[38:30] remember you remember I said the
[38:32] anointing the false anointing remember
[38:33] the Holy Spirit can come and anoint a
[38:36] person and it's and it's still out of
[38:38] the will of God like balam was anointed
[38:41] with the spirit of God in numbers but he
[38:42] was not in the will of God CU he was
[38:43] fighting the program of God I mean here
[38:46] it proves it right here see we have to
[38:48] go through God's way of doing it not our
[38:50] ways God's way of doing it cuz David
[38:52] being a king anointed Anointed with the
[38:54] spirit of God upon him a top of Jesus
[38:56] Christ
[38:57] but that wasn't God's
[38:59] Channel and all the congregation it
[39:02] pleased them the Bible said no as
[39:03] captains of thousands of hundreds also
[39:05] the priests and the theologians thought
[39:07] it was wonderful there is your Bible
[39:09] schools everything else they thought it
[39:10] was wonderful even all the people agreed
[39:13] and the priests and all them agreed that
[39:14] the king's anointing was right notice
[39:16] but God had not promised to reveal his
[39:19] word in its season to them God has his
[39:21] way of revealing his word but not to the
[39:23] m it was contrary to God so all that
[39:26] move of God was actually contrary to God
[39:29] of David putting the Ark on the new cart
[39:31] and doing all the all the singing all
[39:33] the all the ceremony all the worship was
[39:35] actually contrary to how God wanted it
[39:37] to be see we got to be careful we can't
[39:40] go by feeling we can't go by even
[39:43] atmosphere of of caught up into
[39:45] something we got to go take it back to
[39:47] the word of God everything must be
[39:49] subject to the word of God Amen and if
[39:51] it lines up with the word praise God if
[39:54] it doesn't line up let's forget about it
[39:56] amen because remember we don't need to
[39:58] play guessing games anymore down through
[40:01] the age was guessing games this
[40:02] Theologian said this this one said this
[40:04] this one debated this and this and this
[40:06] but now God has opened his full word of
[40:08] God through Malachi 4 amen amen so we
[40:10] don't have to guess the way he wants it
[40:12] to be amen it's the same thing with
[40:15] Ministry we don't need to make up our
[40:17] own types amen you know if God has a
[40:20] inspired you you know all time with
[40:22] what's already been spoken amen that
[40:25] that's how you know it's true amen you
[40:26] know it won't go out of the scripture
[40:29] and and just it as your own idea it will
[40:30] be all of
[40:32] God
[40:34] amen amen that's why we've got to sub
[40:36] that's what I said before doesn't matter
[40:37] how real it may be how exciting it may
[40:39] be it must be subject to the word of God
[40:41] the word the the inspiration must become
[40:44] subject to the word not the other way
[40:47] around he says and my sisters who want
[40:49] to be woman preachers and so forth don't
[40:51] miss this no matter how much your
[40:52] anointing is you've got to get it in
[40:55] God's provided position and God uh
[40:57] David's anointing was all right but in
[40:59] doing it he got enthused and stepped
[41:01] over the boundary line what was that
[41:03] boundary line the word of God so he got
[41:05] enthused hey basically he would have
[41:07] said Brethren the ark must come into the
[41:10] city we want God's presence in our city
[41:14] we don't want it over that hill we don't
[41:15] want it in that Village we want it in
[41:17] the center of Israel God has given us
[41:19] this land he's been such a good god
[41:21] we've got to return the ark back he got
[41:23] enthused because remember David was
[41:25] unusual in a way he just said as as the
[41:27] heart panish for the water Brook so my
[41:28] soul Longs after God and he said that
[41:30] heart is a deer needs water it must must
[41:33] get to water to survive and that was the
[41:35] longing David had he had he wanted to
[41:36] get into the presence of God so he had
[41:38] such a longing to be there he was real
[41:41] enthused but he didn't subject his
[41:43] enthusiasm to the word if he just did
[41:46] that user would never have died right
[41:48] the C would never have been built amen
[41:50] it would have been carried on the
[41:51] shoulders of the priests you see but
[41:54] because of his enthusiasm and his
[41:56] influence on the people they thought it
[41:57] was a good idea remember not one of them
[42:00] said hold on David have you asked Nathan
[42:02] hold on David have you read in Leviticus
[42:04] how the ark should be carried not one of
[42:05] them said that because of David's
[42:07] influence was so great among the people
[42:09] and that's why to be real careful
[42:10] doesn't matter how influential someone
[42:12] may be take it back to the scripture
[42:14] we're actually obligated every one of us
[42:16] to take everything that's preached take
[42:17] it back to the scripture amen if you
[42:19] can't find it in the scripture then just
[42:21] pray about say Lord if it's there show
[42:23] me if it's not well may I just forget
[42:26] about it it's very important we take
[42:29] everything how we live how we treat our
[42:30] families how we treat one another how we
[42:32] treat Sinners on the street it must be
[42:34] according to the scripture amen it must
[42:37] never be with a arrogant proud Spirit
[42:40] you don't see the New Testament Church
[42:42] arrogant and proud no they are Meek
[42:45] humble people amen and God added to the
[42:48] church as many as should be saved why
[42:49] because through them God got a hold of
[42:51] them who wants to live that kind of a
[42:53] life amen so we must take it can be see
[42:56] this seemed like a great idea I think it
[42:59] was a good idea I would like the ark
[43:01] there come come let's be real you know
[43:04] let's be honest I would have been them
[43:06] dancing too praise God here comes the
[43:07] ark Hallelujah this went across the Red
[43:10] Sea oh no didn't went you know went
[43:12] through the Wilderness after SI and all
[43:14] these it went across Jordan Joshua you
[43:17] know you know part of the Jordan and our
[43:18] fourbears came through and all these
[43:20] things I would have been
[43:22] excited if I didn't take the enthusiasm
[43:25] subjected to the
[43:27] word you see and this is what David he
[43:29] didn't consult the right
[43:31] channel that's why he overstepped the
[43:34] boundary line what did he do he stepped
[43:35] over the boundary line instead of
[43:37] putting the Ark in its original position
[43:39] he carried it on a new cart not over the
[43:41] hearts of the Levites see this is what
[43:44] we got to be real careful when we're
[43:45] when we're studying the word we don't go
[43:47] over the boundary line into into
[43:49] something that's not there into a type
[43:52] that doesn't exist right something new
[43:54] CU maybe David would have thought well
[43:56] we've been here about 400 years let's
[43:58] let's have church a little differently
[44:00] to excite the people let's let's
[44:03] generate some enthusiasm now if the word
[44:04] is carried right it will generate
[44:06] enthusiasm because the anointing will be
[44:08] there it will excite the people it'll
[44:10] attract the people if the word is
[44:11] carried right but you see maybe he
[44:13] thought well we're going to do it a
[44:14] modern way hey the Philistines did it
[44:17] this way we just got to fit and let's do
[44:18] it this way see and he was enthused he
[44:20] is sincere but it wasn't according to
[44:22] the word he stepped over the boundary
[44:24] line see that's why it's always God's
[44:27] original plan
[44:29] works amen I think we should stay with
[44:32] God's original plan it was supposed to
[44:34] be carried on the shoulder of the
[44:35] Levites which is over the heart the word
[44:37] is not in the mind it's in the heart see
[44:39] if it's in the mind I'll say it's a
[44:40] theory but if it's in the heart it's a
[44:43] revelation that's why we should speak
[44:45] and preach and teach
[44:47] Revelation you say well we're going to
[44:49] have a lot of reoccurring sermons well
[44:50] that's fine as long as it's Revelation
[44:53] see see Noah preached 120 years and you
[44:56] know what the conclusion of his sermon
[44:57] would have been the world's going to be
[44:59] flooded get in the
[45:01] ark 120 years how I don't know how many
[45:04] sermons he preached that maybe preached
[45:06] every day oh there's a new worker comes
[45:08] along maybe some new people walking
[45:09] along the road to see what's going on on
[45:10] this Hilltop he would have started
[45:12] preaching maybe all different kind of
[45:13] angles he would have ended up with the
[45:15] same
[45:16] conclusion but because it was Revelation
[45:18] it was
[45:19] living amen that's why brother Adam says
[45:21] if you don't know what to say just say
[45:23] how your candle got lit cuz that's
[45:24] Revelation that's real
[45:26] I met God he changed my life he cleansed
[45:28] me up he he he made me a new creation I
[45:30] wasn't looking for him he was looking
[45:32] for me it's it's unmerited
[45:34] Grace
[45:36] hallelujah
[45:38] amen see the word is not in the mind
[45:41] it's in the heart not on a new cart what
[45:43] was it some represented something new
[45:45] David did there spoke of every
[45:46] denomination there ever be God's word is
[45:48] not to be carried by state PR presor or
[45:51] Bishops and so forth of denominations
[45:53] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[45:55] the heart of man and not in some EAS
[45:57] ecclesiastical move the holy spirit is a
[46:00] treasure of go of God's love in the
[46:02] heart of men and women to obey see my
[46:06] sheep know my voice where should that
[46:07] voice be on the inside not not an
[46:10] external teacher it must be an internal
[46:13] teacher amen we're about to put a step
[46:15] wrong that's a contrary to the word
[46:17] there should be a voice and you say stop
[46:19] that doesn't please me yeah I want you
[46:21] to Walk This Way amen don't you love
[46:24] that kind of Correction yes where God
[46:26] speaks on the inside maybe no one else
[46:28] is around you but you God's there the
[46:30] shepherd's there Hallelujah I love that
[46:32] kind of a leadership amen hallelujah and
[46:35] because of it says it doesn't please you
[46:36] it's like I'm please me it's like Lord I
[46:37] just want to please you okay I'm going
[46:39] to go another way amen I remember when I
[46:41] was young young believer and and I was
[46:44] going to my uh like first ever kind of
[46:46] camp we had down at brother Gregs and I
[46:47] was I was at Uni and there were two ATMs
[46:50] at University one was by the uh admin
[46:53] building the other one was round by the
[46:54] front door of the student Pub that I
[46:57] used to live in quite a lot before I met
[46:59] God before he took me out of that
[47:01] place and then I went to the ATM by the
[47:04] um admin building and it wasn't working
[47:06] so I went to and the only other one was
[47:08] by the pub I thought well I'm just going
[47:09] to go get the money out and walk away I
[47:11] get round this other big building that
[47:13] was deafening the noise of the place and
[47:15] as soon as that music Started blasting
[47:17] well I could hear it a voice s to me
[47:18] said I don't want to go
[47:20] there see the Lord said he didn't say
[47:22] you don't want to go there he says I
[47:24] don't want to go there so said okay Lord
[47:26] you don't want to go there I'm not going
[47:28] I've got the money somewhere else I
[47:29] found it somewhere else but you see it
[47:31] should be an inside voice amen that's
[47:35] still Small Voice that speaks to us amen
[47:38] you see we've got to keep the word in
[47:40] continuity it's fundamental we don't
[47:42] just take one scripture one quote and
[47:44] just run wild with it like David did we
[47:46] got to have from Genesis to Revelation
[47:48] it's got a doveet tail this is this is a
[47:50] these things are important yes Amen
[47:52] brother Bram tells us that there's three
[47:54] things we must not do
[47:56] he says this there's three musts in the
[47:58] scripture and using God's word there's
[48:00] three things you must not do now
[48:02] remember this is not just for Ministry
[48:03] this is for individuals this is for
[48:04] everyone right now let's study those for
[48:06] the next 10 minutes three things you
[48:08] must not do and all out in the land
[48:10] wherever you are Across the Nation be
[48:12] sure to put these things in your mind if
[48:13] you haven't got a pencil you must not do
[48:15] these these things we um we tell you all
[48:19] the time what you must do now I'm going
[48:20] to tell you what you must not do now you
[48:22] must not you must not misinterpret the
[48:25] word you say well I believe it means
[48:27] this it means just what it says amen it
[48:31] needs no interpreter and you must not
[48:33] misplace the word and you must not
[48:35] dislocate the word and if we would do
[48:39] either of these it throws the whole
[48:41] Bible in a confusion and in a chaos and
[48:43] I say it throws a whole life into a
[48:45] confusion and a chaos amen so we must
[48:48] not do those things we not we must not
[48:50] misinterpret dislocate or displace the
[48:53] word says notice to misinterpret Jesus
[48:55] in the form of God and a man you make
[48:58] him uh you would make him one God out of
[49:00] three to misinterpret Jesus Christ being
[49:03] the word you would make him one God out
[49:05] of three or you would make him the
[49:07] second person in a godhead so you must
[49:09] because remember he is the Lord God
[49:10] Almighty and he is his word amen so it's
[49:13] very fundamental how brother Bram says
[49:15] to leave God in order to do that you
[49:17] leave the word because if you've left
[49:19] the word you've left God that's why we
[49:21] want to stay with the word Above All
[49:23] Things stay with the word amen if you
[49:25] want deity in your midst welcome and
[49:27] receive the word the brother says in the
[49:29] church age book amen it says and to do
[49:32] that you would miss the whole scripture
[49:34] up You' never get nowhere so it must not
[49:36] be
[49:37] misinterpreted and if you say that a
[49:39] certain thing you put an interpretation
[49:41] on it and you apply it to another time
[49:43] or it's been applied to another time
[49:45] then uh you also make an incorrect
[49:48] interpreting if anybody misinterpret
[49:50] Jesus Christ in the Bible of not being
[49:52] God himself make him the second person
[49:54] or God out of three this would upset
[49:57] every word in the entire Bible it would
[49:59] break the first commandment Thou shalt
[50:00] not have any other God before me all
[50:02] right it would make the whole Christian
[50:04] race of a bunch of pagan worshippers
[50:06] worshiping three different gods see what
[50:09] kind of a Bible you would have then it
[50:10] would make us what the Jews say we are
[50:12] said which one of them Gods is your god
[50:15] see so you see you can't you mustn't
[50:17] misinterpret the Bible that's why I like
[50:20] Thomas when Jesus rose and said put your
[50:23] hand in my side and in the and the holes
[50:26] in my hand hands he said to doubting
[50:28] Thomas and Thomas said my Lord and my
[50:30] God Amen he says basically your God
[50:32] manifested he had the right Revelation
[50:35] and that Revelation has been restored in
[50:37] this end time to you and I amen it is
[50:39] actually the most important revelation
[50:41] of the entire scripture that Jesus
[50:42] Christ is the Lord God Almighty
[50:46] amen amen for Jesus himself is the
[50:48] interpretation of the Bible when he made
[50:50] when he's made manifest in the age
[50:52] that's part uh that the part of his body
[50:55] has been being made manifest if it's a
[50:56] hand age it must be a hand it can't be a
[50:59] head age if it's a voice age then then
[51:01] it can't be a foot age see and now we're
[51:03] at the eye age and next is he himself to
[51:06] come seeing prophetic see down through
[51:09] the age we started off from the
[51:10] foundation from the first church age
[51:12] when the seed went uh in the ground the
[51:14] complete seed that come out through the
[51:16] feet Luther come back then through
[51:18] Wesley then into the Pentecostals the
[51:20] tongues and the lips see now it's in the
[51:22] eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth
[51:24] and now there's nothing left for it but
[51:27] uh for it to come but himself to step
[51:30] into that cuz that's the last thing
[51:32] there is so what is that last thing God
[51:35] is in his people once again am mean God
[51:37] has poured himself emptied himself out
[51:39] amen into his bride body Hallelujah
[51:42] that's why it's more than just works
[51:43] it's more than just gifts of the Spirit
[51:45] it is the giver himself stepping in and
[51:48] manifesting every promise of God that
[51:50] the bride would manifest glory to God
[51:52] Amen we're living in that day amen we
[51:54] don't misinterpret put in another age or
[51:56] even in the future it's now I mean where
[51:58] brother Bram said that the son of man is
[52:00] manifested in a group of people and men
[52:02] and women not just in him a singular man
[52:04] but now in a body around the world
[52:07] Hallelujah so this the son of man is
[52:08] being revealed again in human
[52:10] flesh amen the next thing is the
[52:13] intelligence see it's so important we
[52:14] have the mind of Christ I mean you can't
[52:16] have carnal mind of man like David did
[52:18] he had a carnal understanding Aron a
[52:20] cart brought death but if you have
[52:22] spiritual mind you'll have life amen if
[52:24] you had the right if he went to the
[52:26] right channel he was enthused we want
[52:28] this Ark to come into the city how can
[52:30] it be done Nathan how can it be done and
[52:32] Nathan would say thus sayith the Lord my
[52:34] Levites have been consecrated unto me
[52:36] let them carry me into the city let me
[52:38] let them carry my Ark into the city amen
[52:41] there would not have been death there
[52:43] would have been life amen hallelujah I'm
[52:45] so thankful we can carry the word of God
[52:47] I mean we're priests unto our unto our
[52:50] God we can carry that Revelation in our
[52:52] hearts amen not in a man-made idea of a
[52:54] theory in our mind minds but in our
[52:55] hearts we can pack the word of God
[52:58] hallelujah just like those priests
[52:59] carried the ark that day hallelujah amen
[53:01] you know you know carrying the ark
[53:03] actually brings an entrance into the new
[53:05] land amen the the Levites were told by
[53:07] Joshua to carry the ark into the River
[53:09] Jordan amen and when they stepped into
[53:10] that River at part of that River and
[53:12] then they then the Israelites would
[53:13] cross over into the promised land amen
[53:15] if you're carrying the ark amen you can
[53:17] be a man woman or child but if the Holy
[53:18] Ghost is in you amen you can actually
[53:20] speak an entrance speak eternal life
[53:23] amen that someone could cross over from
[53:25] the Wilderness through death to self
[53:27] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallu
[53:30] amen I believe it
[53:32] amen hallelujah amen see it's his we
[53:36] have no sight of our own how can a man
[53:38] foresee those things he can't do it it's
[53:40] God himself see it's it's it's it's
[53:43] coming to a place and he's governed the
[53:45] body all the way through then the
[53:46] complete body of Christ is revealed in
[53:48] the form of a bride that was taken out
[53:50] of his side like Adam did at the
[53:51] beginning like Adam's was rather at the
[53:54] beginning yes God this would set the
[53:56] entire I mean the whole Bible in a
[53:58] confusion what by misinterpreting
[53:59] dislocating it would break the first
[54:01] commandment make God a pagan God of
[54:03] three it would just ruin the whole Bible
[54:06] uh picture of the Bible so you must not
[54:08] uh so you must not misinterpret the word
[54:10] now there's just that one thing when
[54:12] every scripture in the Bible has the
[54:13] same application you've got to set it in
[54:15] its place and to misplace it you might
[54:18] have him God in one age the next age you
[54:20] make him a history to misplace it that's
[54:23] why it's so important to realize God
[54:25] leave in 1965 amen the pillar of fire is
[54:28] still present the angel of the Lord is
[54:29] still walking among his people amen it's
[54:31] not a yeah God lived back there but now
[54:33] he's not here anymore he's still the
[54:34] same one I mean he still does the same
[54:36] things he still manifests his word today
[54:38] he hasn't changed one bit but if you
[54:40] think he's changed one bit then youve
[54:41] misplaced the scripture we don't want to
[54:43] misplace any Scripture amen he is God
[54:46] all the time if you made him if you made
[54:49] him today a god of history that was back
[54:51] Yonder and he isn't the same today what
[54:53] you what are you going to do with with
[54:55] Hebrews 138 is the same yesterday today
[54:58] and forever I mean now to see what this
[55:01] would do and what it has done it's
[55:03] already done it made him uh make him
[55:06] deny his own word to misplace the
[55:08] scriptures to dislocate the scriptures
[55:10] you might put his body together wrong
[55:12] the feet where the head should be or
[55:14] something just the same or other words
[55:16] you might have Jesus teaching Moses
[55:18] message or you might have Wesley
[55:20] teaching Luther's message you might have
[55:22] now in our age teaching a Pentecostal
[55:24] the pent apostal message you see what a
[55:26] mess it would be in see we're not here
[55:29] to preach the former the word of a
[55:31] former age we're here to preach the re
[55:33] revelation of this age amen which is
[55:35] Luther Wesley Pentecost all added
[55:38] together plus The Giver himself see God
[55:40] is not a god of subtraction he he's a
[55:43] god of addition I will restore all the
[55:45] years the Palm worm the canor the Locust
[55:47] the caterpillar have eaten I will
[55:49] restore it all back amen and that's what
[55:51] God has done in this day he has brought
[55:53] it all back see we don't have we don't
[55:54] just look and say well they had that
[55:56] back there we have all that
[55:57] manifestation we have the just shall
[55:59] live by faith we have that manifestation
[56:01] Lord amen we're being Sanctified amen we
[56:04] have that manifestation we have the
[56:05] gifts of the Spirit amen we have that
[56:07] manifestation but now he himself has
[56:09] stepped in to a body to manifest the
[56:11] entire word I say by God's grace we have
[56:13] that manifestation I'm looking at it
[56:15] here hallelujah if you have received the
[56:18] true baptism of the Holy Ghost you're
[56:20] that hallelujah
[56:22] amen so if we sick with the word we will
[56:25] not be in a mess he says Pentecost has
[56:28] already showed its colors Luther's
[56:29] already showed his went off into
[56:31] denomination it died right there the age
[56:32] stuck and there it went amen but we just
[56:36] keep walking
[56:37] on Amen but what we have received
[56:40] doesn't deviate from the Bible we don't
[56:42] have another Testament of Jesus Christ
[56:44] like the Mormons we have the scripture
[56:47] amen that's why you can go to countries
[56:49] like the first time went to Papa New
[56:50] Guinea I teach the message preach the
[56:52] message from the scripture didn't even
[56:55] quote brother Bram once and they said
[56:56] where'd you get this from well here it
[56:57] is here's the light for the a your eyes
[56:59] came open they came out of Darkness got
[57:01] baptized name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:03] and walked in newness of life because
[57:04] the elect will see the message in the
[57:06] scripture and the elect whether they
[57:08] know it or not their absolute is the
[57:10] scripture cuz they're built that way
[57:12] amen they may not be living it at first
[57:14] but when light strikes them they'll say
[57:16] this word is my absolute am hallelujah
[57:19] hallelujah amen I trust it's yours amen
[57:22] it's not your opinion it is the word of
[57:24] God is your ab
[57:25] amen you've got to have you got to have
[57:27] an absolute amen hallelujah it can't be
[57:30] yourself otherwise you're a one person
[57:32] denomination we don't want to be like
[57:34] that amen so we want to those three
[57:38] things we must not do we must not
[57:40] dislocate the scripture like someone
[57:41] gets a dislocated shoulder we don't want
[57:44] to place it in a wrong place it could be
[57:46] nearly quite right but it's not quite
[57:47] right amen like like being baptized in
[57:49] the name of the father son Holy Ghost as
[57:52] titles that's nearly right but it's not
[57:54] cor it's dislocated cuz what's the name
[57:57] I'm a father I'm a son I'm a brother I'm
[57:59] an uncle I'm a nephew I'm a New
[58:01] Zealander that's none of those in my
[58:03] name my name is Benjamin John glin and
[58:06] so when Peter came full of the Holy
[58:07] Ghost and said repent and be baptized in
[58:09] the name of Jesus Christ for the mission
[58:10] of sin he wasn't contradicting the word
[58:13] of Jesus in Matthew 28 he wasn't
[58:14] dislocating nothing no he was the
[58:16] Revelation had come that's the name
[58:19] remember REM remission of sins will be
[58:22] preached in his name starting at
[58:23] Jerusalem how they do it baptized in the
[58:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that
[58:28] is the name there's only one name given
[58:30] under Heaven by which men must be
[58:32] saved amen people will preach in his
[58:34] name pray in his name do all kind of
[58:36] things in name but take on his name
[58:37] that's all together a different thing
[58:39] but the bride will take on his name
[58:40] gladly amen they want to be identified
[58:43] with his word they want to be identified
[58:44] with every part of him amen
[58:47] amen amen things that are misplaced
[58:49] people seem to misplace scriptures these
[58:51] days oh where did that one go about
[58:53] Holiness it just gets misplaced but the
[58:56] bride doesn't misplace it amen cuz
[58:57] they've got the real interpretation of
[58:59] the word amen and to misinterpret making
[59:02] God three or five or you know it's
[59:04] amazing people take a manifestation of
[59:06] God and they call it a God so if you go
[59:08] through the AL you take Abraham God
[59:10] revealed himself many different forms to
[59:12] Abraham he was Lord God Almighty is
[59:15] mesc Paul says he had without father or
[59:17] mother beginning or end malchis was God
[59:20] he wasn't a human he wasn't a lineage
[59:22] right he wasn't a priesthood and then he
[59:23] was alai different ones God revealed
[59:26] himself different forms to Abraham now
[59:29] God didn't Abraham didn't say well I'm
[59:30] serving five or Trinity whatever he you
[59:32] it's the same God revealing himself in
[59:34] different forms and it's the same God
[59:36] down through the New Testament just
[59:37] reveals himself in a different form amen
[59:39] but you see God's name doesn't change in
[59:41] the New Testament because Jesus Christ
[59:44] Jesus means Jehovah's salvation amen
[59:46] that that is the meaning of the name of
[59:48] Jesus Amen so God the the highest name
[59:51] of God is G the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[59:56] why what's the what's the Salvation from
[59:58] is it from a natural slavery like in in
[1:00:00] Egypt no it's from a far greater slavery
[1:00:03] of sin and unbelief amen the chains of
[1:00:05] hell and darkness we've been liberated
[1:00:07] amen we've we we we have experienced the
[1:00:10] power of that name I trust you have amen
[1:00:12] Glory huj Hallelujah but you see it's
[1:00:15] very important we stick with the word
[1:00:17] because if we don't then God will spew
[1:00:19] us out of his mouth we'll no longer
[1:00:21] speak for him I mean we don't want to
[1:00:22] speak for we we don't we call this place
[1:00:26] Shak Tabernacle cuz we need a name but
[1:00:29] we don't speak for a church amen we are
[1:00:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ right see the
[1:00:34] complaint against this age this ly and
[1:00:36] church age we live in Rich increase with
[1:00:38] Goods have need of nothing this is this
[1:00:40] age we liveing but he says that you know
[1:00:43] this you know but the complaint is
[1:00:46] lukewarmness and the penalty of this
[1:00:48] lukewarmness says because you're neither
[1:00:50] hot nor cold I'll spew the out of out of
[1:00:52] my
[1:00:53] mouth now we know that this this um this
[1:00:57] spewing out of his mouth is the people
[1:01:01] who are lukewarm no longer speak for him
[1:01:04] God can't use them to speak life God
[1:01:07] can't anoint those people to Speak Life
[1:01:09] of their lukewarm now lukewarmness is
[1:01:12] actually a lack of conviction is is is
[1:01:15] one of the descriptions of it and so if
[1:01:18] someone becomes lukewarm about the truth
[1:01:20] it's because there something else has
[1:01:21] become more important right so so it
[1:01:24] goes from the pure word of God but then
[1:01:27] if a Theory comes in that's contrary to
[1:01:29] the word but it sounds more exciting and
[1:01:31] people go towards that and they become
[1:01:33] lukewarm towards the word right we don't
[1:01:36] want to be lukewarm towards the word we
[1:01:38] want to be red hot amen amen let's be
[1:01:40] lukewarm towards man's idea see I'm not
[1:01:42] interested in even my own thinking what
[1:01:44] do you think about it I actually don't
[1:01:46] care what does the Bible say what does
[1:01:47] the message say you know I got this
[1:01:49] problem what does the word say about it
[1:01:52] you know I think I you I I think it's
[1:01:54] how we should be Lord I feel this way
[1:01:56] well what does the word say oh well it's
[1:01:58] different to my feelings kick the
[1:02:00] feeling out you know take the word amen
[1:02:02] it's very important we do that because
[1:02:03] the devil will use our feelings against
[1:02:05] us to walk contrary to the word of God
[1:02:07] just like David he was enthused about
[1:02:09] bringing the ark but he's doing it
[1:02:10] contrary to the word of God Amen I was
[1:02:13] going to read this from the church age
[1:02:14] book we are going to look at this
[1:02:15] carefully it says that this ly in church
[1:02:17] age group is lukewarm this lukewarmness
[1:02:19] demands a penalty from God the penalty
[1:02:22] is that they will be spewed out of his
[1:02:23] mouth there is where we don't want to go
[1:02:26] astray as a lot of folks do they very
[1:02:28] unwisely say that God can spew you out
[1:02:30] of his mouth and that proves there
[1:02:32] there's no such thing or any truth of to
[1:02:34] the doctrine of the perseverance of the
[1:02:35] Saints I want to correct your thinking
[1:02:37] right now this verse is not given to an
[1:02:39] individual it's given to the church he
[1:02:40] is talking to the church furthermore if
[1:02:43] you just keep uh if you just keep the
[1:02:46] the word in mind you'll recall that
[1:02:48] nowhere does it say that we are in the
[1:02:50] mouth of God we're engraved on his palms
[1:02:52] we're carried in his bosom way back in
[1:02:54] the known ages before time we're in his
[1:02:56] mind we are in his Sheepfold and we are
[1:02:58] in his pastures but never in his mouth
[1:03:00] but what is in the mouth of the Lord the
[1:03:02] word is in his mouth Matthew 4:4 and but
[1:03:05] he answered and said it is written man
[1:03:06] shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:03:08] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:03:10] mouth of God the word is supposed to be
[1:03:12] in your mouths too now we know that the
[1:03:14] church is his body it is here taking his
[1:03:17] place what will be in the mouth of the
[1:03:19] church the word 1 Peter 4:11 If any man
[1:03:22] speak let him speak as the oracles or
[1:03:25] the word of God so if if his word is in
[1:03:28] your mouth it's not you speaking it's
[1:03:31] him speaking and I want him to speak I
[1:03:33] don't want me to speak I want him to
[1:03:34] speak even when we're on the street
[1:03:36] going back our daily life I want him to
[1:03:38] speak amen amen am mean the word is
[1:03:41] supposed to be in your mouths too right
[1:03:42] wait 1 Peter 4 yes okay uh 2 Peter 1:21
[1:03:46] for the prophecy came not in all time by
[1:03:47] the will of man but holy men of God
[1:03:50] spake as are moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:03:51] then what is wrong with these people of
[1:03:53] the last days they've gotten away from
[1:03:55] the word they're no longer fervent about
[1:03:57] it they are lukewarm about it he says
[1:03:59] I'm going to prove it to you right now
[1:04:01] he says the Baptists have their Creeds
[1:04:02] and dogmas based on the word and you
[1:04:04] can't shake them they say the apostolic
[1:04:05] days of Miracles are over and there's no
[1:04:07] baptism with the Holy Ghost subsequent
[1:04:09] to believing the methodists say based on
[1:04:12] the word that there's no water baptism
[1:04:14] sprinkling is not baptism and that
[1:04:15] sanctification is the baptism with the
[1:04:17] Holy goost baptism in the Greek means to
[1:04:20] be immersed that's why he's saying a
[1:04:22] sprinkling is not a baptism
[1:04:25] right the Church of Christ mjes in
[1:04:26] regeneration of baptism and in all too
[1:04:28] many cases they go down dry Sinners and
[1:04:30] come up wet ones yet they claim their
[1:04:32] Doctrine is word-based go right down the
[1:04:34] line and come to the Pentecostals do
[1:04:36] they have the word give them the word
[1:04:37] test and see they'll sell out the word
[1:04:39] for a sensation about just every time if
[1:04:42] you can produce a manifestation like oil
[1:04:44] and blood and tongues and other signs
[1:04:46] whether in the word or not or whether
[1:04:48] properly interpreted from the word the
[1:04:50] majority will fall for it but what has
[1:04:52] happened to the word the word has been
[1:04:54] being put aside by all these other
[1:04:56] things amen so God says I'm going
[1:04:59] against you all I'll spew you out of my
[1:05:00] mouth this is the end for for out of
[1:05:02] seven of Seven Ages I've seen nothing
[1:05:04] but man esteeming his own word above
[1:05:06] mine so at the end of this age I'm going
[1:05:08] to spew you out of my mouth it's all
[1:05:09] over I'm going to speak right yes I am
[1:05:12] in the midst of the church the aming of
[1:05:14] God faithful and true will will reveal
[1:05:16] himself and it will be by my Prophet oh
[1:05:18] yes it is so Revelations 10:7 and the
[1:05:20] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:05:22] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:05:24] God should be finished as he ha declared
[1:05:26] to his servants the prophets there it is
[1:05:27] he's sending a Vindicated Prophet he's
[1:05:29] sending a prophet after almost 2,000
[1:05:31] years he sending someone who'll be so
[1:05:33] far from organization education and the
[1:05:35] world world of religion that as John the
[1:05:37] Baptist and Elijah of olded he will hear
[1:05:39] only from God and he will have thus sayi
[1:05:41] the Lord and speak for God he'll be
[1:05:43] God's mouthpiece And he as it is
[1:05:45] declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the
[1:05:47] hearts of the children back to the
[1:05:49] fathers he'll bring back the elect of
[1:05:51] the last day and they will hear a
[1:05:52] Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth
[1:05:55] as it was with Paul he will restore the
[1:05:56] truth as they had and those elect with
[1:05:59] him in that day will be the ones who
[1:06:00] truly manifest the Lord and will be his
[1:06:03] body and be his voice and perform his
[1:06:05] Works Hallelujah do you see it amen
[1:06:08] that's why it's so important to be
[1:06:09] restored back to the truth of the word
[1:06:10] that we his body his voice and perform
[1:06:13] his Works amen amen praise the
[1:06:17] Lord amen he says this here I'm just I'm
[1:06:19] just I'm just jumping down a bit he says
[1:06:21] now he has cried out in this last age
[1:06:23] you have the word you have more Bibles
[1:06:26] than ever but you're not doing anything
[1:06:27] about the word except dividing and
[1:06:29] hacking into pieces taking what you want
[1:06:31] leaving out what you don't want you're
[1:06:32] not interested in living it but debating
[1:06:34] it i' sooner you are hot or cold if you
[1:06:37] are cold and rejected it I could stand
[1:06:39] that but if you but if you would get
[1:06:41] white hot to know its truth and live it
[1:06:42] I'd praise you for that but when you
[1:06:44] simply take my word and don't honor it I
[1:06:47] in return must refuse to honor you I'll
[1:06:48] spew you out of my mouth you nauseate me
[1:06:51] we don't want to be like that where we
[1:06:53] just take his word but don't how do you
[1:06:55] honor his word let it change you that's
[1:06:58] how you truly honor the word of God let
[1:07:00] it change you amen if it's a direct pole
[1:07:02] opposite to you you change that you
[1:07:04] match the word see we our experience
[1:07:07] must much must match God's Bible right
[1:07:10] we don't twist the word to make it match
[1:07:12] our experience no our experience must
[1:07:15] match the Bible amen
[1:07:18] hallelujah amen now I'm sorry for all
[1:07:20] the reading but I just need to get
[1:07:21] through the see brother BR says now
[1:07:23] that's the reason
[1:07:24] you hear on tape say what the tape say
[1:07:27] say what the vision says so basically
[1:07:29] say what the word says don't deviate
[1:07:31] from that word right stay with the
[1:07:33] foundation stay with the blueprint stay
[1:07:35] with the word of God Amen because if we
[1:07:38] leave the word then Revival dies you
[1:07:40] want to kill Revival leave the word if
[1:07:43] you want to go from a a joy of God joy
[1:07:46] unspeakable full of glory and go into
[1:07:48] coldness and indifference leave the word
[1:07:50] right if you want the peace of God to
[1:07:52] leave your heart leave the word you
[1:07:54] can't have the peace of God that passes
[1:07:55] all understanding and leave the word you
[1:07:58] can't have joy unspeakable and full of
[1:08:00] glory and leave the word you can't have
[1:08:02] a sound mind and leave the word you
[1:08:04] can't do it though see see people want
[1:08:07] all the benefits of being a Believer
[1:08:09] without being a Believer people want all
[1:08:11] the benefits of being a Christian
[1:08:12] without a death to self and becoming one
[1:08:14] being born again so you can't have the
[1:08:17] benefits of Faith by living in unbelief
[1:08:20] you can't do that and we'll probably go
[1:08:21] into that in a future time but you know
[1:08:22] you can't have those things if if you
[1:08:24] want peace at pass who wants peace at
[1:08:25] pass all understanding who wants join
[1:08:27] spigle full of Glory who wants a
[1:08:29] Shepherd to guide them in times of
[1:08:31] trouble who wants him to comfort you
[1:08:33] amen when you're troubled who wants him
[1:08:35] to guide you you who wants him to
[1:08:36] stabilize your walk stabilize your thing
[1:08:38] give you a sound mind well then stay
[1:08:40] with the word am it's that simple amen
[1:08:43] it is that simple who wants
[1:08:46] Revival stay with the word what is a
[1:08:49] real Revival you awaken to who you are
[1:08:51] in the word that's why when the people
[1:08:53] from America came over to Wales in the
[1:08:54] Welsh Revival they see that see that
[1:08:56] policeman swinging around his Bat and
[1:08:58] whistling I'm so glad I can S one of
[1:09:00] them or something you know they say good
[1:09:01] sir we're looking for the Welsh revival
[1:09:03] can you tell me where it is he says I am
[1:09:04] the Welsh Revival Hallelujah why because
[1:09:07] the word came open to the policeman he
[1:09:09] realize he's more than a man from Wales
[1:09:11] and a policeman he's a Son of God am me
[1:09:13] it was an Awakening took place in his
[1:09:15] life I don't know where he came from it
[1:09:16] doesn't matter but it was it was
[1:09:18] quickened to him that he's part of the
[1:09:20] word amen you want that to leave you
[1:09:23] leave the word if you want spiritual
[1:09:26] Amnesia we can't remember who you are
[1:09:27] where you're going where you came from
[1:09:29] leave the word but if you want to know
[1:09:31] who you are and you want to know your
[1:09:33] true identity stay with the word stay in
[1:09:36] the word amen this world cannot tell you
[1:09:38] who you are doesn't matter if you get a
[1:09:40] DNA test and it traces your lineage back
[1:09:42] to whoever that doesn't actually tell
[1:09:44] you who you truly are amen no the word
[1:09:46] of God tells you your real identity amen
[1:09:50] and if you stay with it stay with what
[1:09:52] the messenger gave amen then you'll have
[1:09:54] Revival Revival will not die down like
[1:09:56] I've got underlined there it will get
[1:09:58] greater amen what the word will become
[1:10:00] more
[1:10:02] alive amen we must learn the necessity
[1:10:05] of only to speak what the messenger has
[1:10:07] spoken amen see Paul warned the people
[1:10:10] to say only what he said 1 Corinthians
[1:10:12] 14:37 If any man think himself to be a
[1:10:15] prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge
[1:10:16] the things that I write unto you are the
[1:10:18] Commandments of the Lord so if you're
[1:10:20] spiritual you'll recognize the word is
[1:10:22] not just Theory ideas or an opinion it
[1:10:25] is thus sayith the Lord amen what came
[1:10:28] the word out of you from you or did it
[1:10:30] come unto you only I say the word came
[1:10:32] to
[1:10:33] me did the word find you it came to you
[1:10:36] amen they add here take away there and
[1:10:38] soon the message is no longer pure what
[1:10:41] happens they take their own ideas like
[1:10:43] David put the Ark on a cart and it was
[1:10:47] no longer pure the the Revival right and
[1:10:52] the Revival dies down how can careful
[1:10:53] you must be to hear one voice for the
[1:10:56] spirit has but one voice which is the
[1:10:58] voice of God and if you know the
[1:11:00] shepherd you know his voice you know
[1:11:02] when it's God speaking and the devil
[1:11:04] pretending to be God speaking and you're
[1:11:06] not guessing to work out which one it is
[1:11:08] cuz you know the voice of the shepherd I
[1:11:09] trust you know his word so well you know
[1:11:11] that in inside voice so well that when
[1:11:14] the Devil comes along to to try and
[1:11:16] masquerade like God you know you're a
[1:11:18] phony buddy amen you know I trust you
[1:11:20] know him you know the Shepherd that well
[1:11:23] you know the best way to um you know
[1:11:25] they used to uh train people to to to
[1:11:28] work out what counterfeit money is you
[1:11:29] know how they did that they got them to
[1:11:31] study the genuine enough if you study
[1:11:34] the genuine enough not from an
[1:11:36] intellectual standpoint we say God open
[1:11:38] your word to me reveal it to me Lord you
[1:11:40] wrote this book I need to know show it
[1:11:42] to me Lord then you'll see the
[1:11:47] counterfeit
[1:11:49] amen let's just finish with this cuz I
[1:11:52] feel like I've gone on a bit now now in
[1:11:53] every age it is the same cry hear what
[1:11:56] the spirit says if you're a Christian
[1:11:59] who's a Christian
[1:12:00] today you will get back to what the
[1:12:02] spirit is teaching that is the word of
[1:12:05] this age every Messenger to every age W
[1:12:08] will preach that word every fresh and
[1:12:10] true Revival will be because men has
[1:12:12] gotten back to the word for their age
[1:12:15] amen so if you want a true Revival in
[1:12:17] your own life get back to the word how
[1:12:20] do you will you say but I'm a message
[1:12:22] believer if your opinions are contrary
[1:12:25] to the message you've got to lay aside
[1:12:27] the opinion and take the word and that's
[1:12:29] how you get back to the word amen right
[1:12:31] you say well I've been taught it this
[1:12:32] way take it back into the word study it

[1:12:36] see it all tied together God will show
[1:12:38] it to you amen this is why you know see
[1:12:41] every fresh and true Revival I just want
[1:12:42] to repeat this because I like it every
[1:12:44] fresh and true Revival will because men

[1:12:47] age The Cry of every age is the rebuke

[1:12:51] come back to the word from the first
[1:12:53] book book in the Bible Genesis to the
[1:12:54] last book Revelation there's only one
[1:12:56] reason for God's displeasure leaving the
[1:12:58] word and there's only one remedy to
[1:13:00] regain his favor come back to the word I
[1:13:03] want the grace and favor of God on my
