[34:46] um thank you musicians just while you're
[34:48] standing let's turn in our Bibles
[34:51] to Galatians
[34:54] 5:16 brother adaman could I have that
[34:56] other tablet up here please
[35:11] bro Galatians 5:16 says this I say then
[35:17] walk in the spirit and ye shall not
[35:19] fulfill the lust of the
[35:22] Flesh and that is my whole sermon
[35:28] you know we if you want to live an
[35:30] overcoming life then this is what we do
[35:32] this is this is how we this is how we
[35:34] overcome it's not 10 steps to overcoming
[35:36] or anything it's just this one step here
[35:38] walk in the spirit and you won't fulfill
[35:40] the lust of the
[35:41] flesh
[35:43] um praise the Lord you can take your
[35:45] seats this
[35:47] morning I want to give my condolences to
[35:50] um brother Ed and his family for the
[35:52] passing of his father that we heard of
[35:55] um this morning
[35:58] you know in some ways we if we were in a
[36:00] different environment we would be very
[36:02] sad which naturally we are sad but we
[36:04] would be very hopeless I would would say
[36:07] more because the sadness that comes with
[36:10] hopelessness that these situations are
[36:13] the
[36:13] end uh
[36:16] unfulfilling there's no hope anymore in
[36:20] the situation when we when we don't know
[36:22] Christ then we think somebody is gone
[36:24] forever then then hope is gone and and
[36:28] and there's it's just grieving to let go
[36:31] but as a Christian we know this is not
[36:34] the
[36:35] end job said though the skin worms
[36:38] destroy this body yet in my flesh I'll
[36:40] see
[36:41] God he looks around and he said the the
[36:44] leaves they the tree grows and the
[36:46] leaves fall off and it falls down but
[36:48] then it lives again so man and when man
[36:50] goes in the ground man has got to live
[36:52] again somewhere so so although it's it
[36:55] is a sad time there's a there's a
[36:57] naturally we we separate in this natural
[37:00] world from from people that we
[37:04] love all because of sin that's why this
[37:07] thing happened and yet we have a blessed
[37:09] hope that we will meet again it's not
[37:11] the end that that we'll rise
[37:14] again so we we want to you know go
[37:17] through each other we we go through the
[37:19] highs with the Brethren then we go
[37:20] through the lows and we all have these
[37:22] things in our life we all have highs we
[37:24] all have lows we all have wins we all
[37:26] have losses we all have happiness we all
[37:28] have disappointments and we go through
[37:31] it with each other so brother Ed and
[37:33] family condolences to you and and and
[37:37] may God bless you through this you know
[37:40] it's an evil thing what sin has done
[37:43] this thing Even Called Death we
[37:44] shouldn't have actually gone through
[37:46] this
[37:47] whole journey it wasn't supposed to be
[37:49] like this the human mind wasn't supposed
[37:51] to go through this journey of death and
[37:53] losing and all that we were supposed to
[37:55] actually just be in a place where
[37:56] there's life it wasn't wasn't supposed
[37:57] to be like this we were supposed to just
[38:00] have life and just have happiness and
[38:02] joy and refreshing and and just
[38:06] everlasting life but but the the curse
[38:08] of sin brought this upon the world that
[38:11] that that we have to go through and
[38:12] that's why as a Christian you know we we
[38:14] no matter how much of a Godly and holy
[38:15] life we live we just still go through
[38:17] all these things we go through all these
[38:19] downs and hardships and things we're not
[38:22] exempt from it we just have a blessed
[38:24] hope that there's more to life than this
[38:27] this is not the end this and and this is
[38:30] not my final resting place and this is
[38:31] not the this is not the final experience
[38:33] that I'm going to have we the greatest
[38:35] experience we could have here is nothing
[38:36] compared to the the awesome experience
[38:38] we'll have in glory when we when this
[38:41] this sinful Nature's gone this flesh is
[38:43] gone and we're just living in the
[38:44] presence of God and there's just life
[38:46] that's what that's the hope that we have
[38:48] and that's that's why we're here
[38:49] preaching the gospel right that's that's
[38:52] why we do all this we don't do all this
[38:53] to to have a club but we do this so that
[38:55] each one of you the souls that I that I
[38:59] see in front of me can receive
[39:01] redemption and forgiveness through Jesus
[39:03] Christ and receive the Holy Ghost and be
[39:05] saved and be Eternal that's that's why
[39:07] we're here this morning praise the Lord
[39:10] so um I've got a somewhat different uh
[39:15] way that I'm going to do this this
[39:16] morning and I haven't done this before
[39:19] so it may not
[39:24] work it it will work because it's the
[39:27] word of God
[39:28] but but what I want to do is actually go
[39:32] through Romans 1 to Romans 8 but in a
[39:35] sermon form and I'm not going to do it
[39:38] verbatim word for word although it is
[39:40] quite close to it but I want to I've
[39:43] sort of made it in a way that we can
[39:45] understand because no doubt we've all
[39:46] read Romans we've all read Corinthians
[39:49] we've all read Matthew we've all read
[39:50] the Bible at different times in
[39:51] different
[39:52] places um
[39:56] but some sometimes the the way to really
[39:59] get the essence of it is to go through
[40:00] it and
[40:01] one uh journey to actually get out the
[40:05] the general thought of what it was
[40:06] supposed to be you know even when we
[40:08] preach we might preach on a thought and
[40:10] then we'll take a scripture from here
[40:11] and then a script scripture from
[40:13] Revelation a scripture from Genesis a
[40:15] scripture from Hebrews a scripture from
[40:17] Mark and we'll we'll be speaking on a
[40:19] specific thought you know we be taking
[40:21] all these other thoughts to align with
[40:24] what we're saying and the word of God is
[40:25] like that it's a it's a a very big thing
[40:28] you know we can't sit down and exhaust
[40:30] the word of God and the the concept of
[40:32] God but um this morning I just want to
[40:35] go through it like a sermon so I'm going
[40:36] to go through Romans 1:8 so you're
[40:38] actually going to take the Journey of
[40:39] Romans 1 through to Romans 8 because I
[40:43] believe it's a
[40:44] pivotal uh scripture a piece of
[40:48] scripture that explains what's happened
[40:51] explains who we are explains how we get
[40:52] saved and explains how we overcome it
[40:55] it's it's applies to everybody this
[40:57] scripture Romans 1:8 now you've all read
[40:59] Romans 1:8 yeah yeah yeah but we're just
[41:05] going to go and I tried to make it
[41:06] simple because I want the young fellas
[41:08] to understand it you know if
[41:10] you this is a part this this this
[41:13] scripture is actually I want everyone to
[41:16] understand this because if we anchor
[41:17] this down in our hearts of how we're
[41:19] saved what the Lord's done for us and
[41:21] how we overcome just in a if we really
[41:24] just lay hold of it it it changes our
[41:26] life because we we can walk in more
[41:28] freedom we can walk in Liberty we don't
[41:29] have to walk in under any sort of
[41:32] bondage but we can walk in Freedom and
[41:33] in Liberty because we know for a fact
[41:37] that the Lord has set me free from the
[41:39] law he set me free from these things I'm
[41:40] walking in the Liberty in Christ and I'm
[41:42] filled with the Holy Ghost and we attain
[41:44] that by faith
[41:48] okay I'm going to it's going to seem a
[41:50] little bit dry because I'm just going to
[41:52] go through it like I'm going to read off
[41:54] the screen is that all right feel like a
[41:56] bit of an old you know the old
[41:57] I don't know Catholic priests and that
[42:00] their sermons are sort of just they sit
[42:01] up there and read out a piece of paper
[42:02] you know
[42:04] and but I want it to be full of life
[42:06] okay but I but I don't want to deviate
[42:08] Too Much from the Journey of Romans that
[42:10] we're going to take and we'll get
[42:11] through it in like 40 minutes it's
[42:13] pretty it's I've made it quite
[42:16] fast okay okay you ready yeah praise the
[42:21] Lord let's
[42:25] go I've been called and separated to be
[42:28] a preacher and I'm here today to preach
[42:31] to you the gospel of
[42:33] God the gospel which the prophets have
[42:37] already written
[42:39] about when they wrote For unto us a
[42:41] child is born unto us a son is given and
[42:44] the government shall be upon his
[42:46] shoulders and his name Shall be Called
[42:48] wonderful counsel of the Mighty God the
[42:51] Everlasting father the Prince of Peace
[42:54] all we like sheep have gone astray
[42:57] we have turned everyone to his own way
[43:00] and the Lord hath laid on him the
[43:02] iniquity of us
[43:06] all this gospel is about his son who as
[43:10] to his Earthly life was a descendant of
[43:13] David but he was declared to be the Son
[43:16] of God when he was raised from the
[43:20] dead through Christ God has given us the
[43:24] privilege and Authority as preachers to
[43:27] tell people everywhere what God has done
[43:29] for them so that they will believe and
[43:32] Obey him bringing glory to his name
[43:35] amen you are part of those
[43:39] people I'm speaking to all of you on
[43:43] Wellington who are loved by God and are
[43:45] called to be his own holy
[43:49] people may God our Father and the Lord
[43:52] Jesus Christ give you Grace and peace
[43:57] now let me say first that I thank my God
[44:01] through Jesus Christ for all of you
[44:03] because your faith in him is being
[44:05] talked about all over the
[44:08] world
[44:10] Amen and I always pray for you and I'm
[44:13] happy that I'm here with
[44:15] you and I like to be here with you
[44:18] because I like to impart something
[44:19] spiritual to you that you could be
[44:21] strong and that could encourage your
[44:22] faith but also have my faith encouraged
[44:25] by yours
[44:28] I want to work among you and see
[44:30] spiritual fruit just as I've seen among
[44:33] other people for I have a great sense of
[44:35] obligation to people in both the First
[44:37] World countries and in the rest of the
[44:39] world to the educated and to the
[44:43] uneducated because I am not ashamed of
[44:46] the gospel because because it is the
[44:49] power of God for salvation to everyone
[44:51] who
[44:52] believes to the Jew then to the Greek
[44:55] and the Gentile
[44:59] also this gospel tells us how God makes
[45:02] us right in his
[45:04] sight this is accomplished from start to
[45:08] finish by
[45:10] faith as the scriptures say it is
[45:13] through faith that a righteous person
[45:16] has
[45:20] life for the wrath of God is revealed
[45:22] from Heaven against all ungodly and
[45:25] unrighteous people who would rather
[45:27] promote evil than God's
[45:33] truth they know the truth about God
[45:37] because he has made it obvious to
[45:39] them for ever since the world was
[45:42] created people have seen the Earth
[45:44] they've seen the
[45:47] sky through everything God made they can
[45:50] clearly see his invisible qualities his
[45:53] eternal power and his divine nature so
[45:57] they have no excuse for not knowing God
[46:01] Amen yes they knew God but they wouldn't
[46:05] worship him as God or even give him
[46:08] thanks and they began to think up
[46:10] foolish ideas of what God was like as a
[46:14] result their minds became dark and
[46:18] Confused claiming to be wise they
[46:21] instead became utter
[46:25] fools and instead of worshiping the
[46:28] Glorious everliving
[46:31] God they worshiped Idols made to look
[46:34] like mere people and birds and animals
[46:38] and
[46:39] reptiles they traded the truth about God
[46:42] for a lie so they worshiped and served
[46:44] the things that God created instead of
[46:47] the Creator
[46:50] himself so God abandoned them to do
[46:54] whatever shameful things their hearts
[46:55] desired and as a result they did vile
[46:59] and degrading things with each other's
[47:03] bodies that's why God abandoned them to
[47:06] their shameful desires even the woman
[47:08] turned against the natural way and
[47:10] became
[47:13] homosexual and the men also became
[47:15] homosexual men did shameful things with
[47:18] other men and as a result of the sin
[47:21] they suffered within themselves the
[47:22] penalty they deserve
[47:26] and since they thought that it was
[47:28] foolish to acknowledge God he abandoned
[47:31] them to their foolish thinking and let
[47:33] them do things that never should be
[47:37] done their lives became full of every
[47:40] kind of wickedness sin greed hate Envy
[47:45] murder quarreling deception malicious
[47:48] behavior gossip slanderers God haters
[47:50] insolent arrogant boastful they invent
[47:53] new forms of evil they disobey the
[47:56] appearance parents they refuse to
[47:58] understand they break their promises
[48:01] they are heartless they have no
[48:06] mercy they know that God's justice
[48:09] requires that those who do those things
[48:11] deserve to die yet they do them anyway
[48:15] and worse yet they encourage other
[48:16] people to do the
[48:19] same now you might think that you can
[48:22] condemn such people but you are just as
[48:25] bad and you have no excuse
[48:28] when you say they are wicked and should
[48:29] be punished you are condemning yourself
[48:32] for you who judge others do these very
[48:35] same
[48:38] things now we know that God's judgment
[48:40] against those who do such things is
[48:43] based on
[48:45] truth do you think you who judge those
[48:48] who practice such things and yet do them
[48:50] yourselves that you will escape the
[48:52] Judgment of
[48:55] God don't you you see how wonderfully
[48:58] kind and tolerant and patient God is
[49:01] with
[49:03] you does this mean nothing to you can't
[49:06] you see that his kindness is intended to
[49:09] turn you away from your
[49:11] sin but because of your stubbornness and
[49:13] your unrepentant heart you are storing
[49:15] up wrath against yourself for the day of
[49:17] God's Wrath when his rightous righteous
[49:20] judgment shall be
[49:24] revealed God will repay every every
[49:26] person according to what they've done
[49:29] he'll give eternal life to those who
[49:31] keep on doing good seeking after the
[49:33] glory and honor and immortality that God
[49:35] offers but he will pour out his anger
[49:38] and wrath against those who live for
[49:39] themselves who refuse to obey the truth
[49:41] and instead live lives of
[49:43] wickedness there will be trouble and
[49:45] Calamity for everyone who keeps on doing
[49:47] what is evil the Jew first then the
[49:52] Gentile but there will be glory and
[49:55] honor and peace from God for all who do
[49:57] good for the Jew first and also for the
[50:02] Gentile because God does not show
[50:08] favoritism when the Gentiles sin they'll
[50:11] be
[50:12] destroyed even though they never had
[50:14] God's written
[50:15] law and the Jews who do have God's law
[50:18] will be judged by that law when they
[50:20] fail to obey
[50:23] it because merely listening to the law
[50:26] it doesn't make us right with God it's
[50:28] obeying the law that makes us right in
[50:30] his
[50:32] sight because even Gentiles who don't
[50:35] have God's written
[50:37] law show they know his law when they
[50:39] instinctively obey it even without
[50:42] having heard it they demonstrate that
[50:44] God's law is written in their hearts for
[50:47] their own conscience and thoughts either
[50:49] accuse them or tell them they are doing
[50:54] right and this is the message that I
[50:56] Proclaim that the day is coming when God
[50:58] through Christ Jesus Will judge every
[51:00] person's secret
[51:03] life okay now you who call yourselves
[51:07] Jews who are relying on God's law and
[51:10] you boast about your special
[51:11] relationship with
[51:13] them you know what he
[51:16] wants you know what is right because you
[51:18] have been taught his
[51:21] law and also you're convinced that you
[51:23] are a guide for the Blind and a light
[51:26] for the people who are lost in
[51:29] darkness you think you can instruct the
[51:31] ignorant and teach children the ways of
[51:33] God for you are certain that God's law
[51:35] gives you complete knowledge and
[51:38] Truth well then if you teach others why
[51:40] don't you teach yourself you tell others
[51:43] not to steal but do you
[51:45] steal you say it's wrong to commit
[51:47] adultery but do you commit
[51:49] adultery you condemn idolatry but do you
[51:52] use items stolen from Pagan temples
[51:57] you are so proud of knowing the law but
[51:59] you dishonor God by breaking it no
[52:02] wonder the scriptures say the
[52:04] unbelievers make fun of the name of God
[52:06] because of
[52:09] you the Jewish ceremony of circumcision
[52:12] has value only if you obey God's law but
[52:15] if you don't obey God's law you are no
[52:17] better off than an uncircumcised
[52:20] Gentile
[52:21] yeah so then if those who are not
[52:25] circumcised keep the Lord Law's
[52:26] requirements will they not be regarded
[52:28] as though they were
[52:30] circumcised in fact circumcised Gentiles
[52:33] who keep God's law will condemn you Jews
[52:35] who are circumcised and possess God's
[52:38] law but don't obey
[52:41] it because you're not a true Jew just
[52:43] because you were born of Jewish parents
[52:45] or because you have gone through the
[52:46] ceremony of
[52:48] circumcision no a true Jew is one whose
[52:51] Heart Is Right with God and true
[52:53] circumcision is not merely obeying the
[52:55] letter of the Lord rather it is a
[52:57] changed heart produced by the
[52:59] spirit and a person with a changed heart
[53:02] seeks praise from God not from
[53:06] people okay
[53:08] then what advantage has the
[53:11] Jew or what's the value of circumcision
[53:15] then a
[53:17] lot the Jews have been entrusted with
[53:20] the very words of
[53:23] God true some of them run faithful but
[53:27] just because they were
[53:29] Unfaithful that does not mean does that
[53:31] mean God will be
[53:32] unfaithful of course not even if
[53:36] everyone else is a liar God is
[53:38] true as the scripture say about him you
[53:41] will be proved right in what you say and
[53:44] you will win your case in
[53:48] court but some Jews will use the
[53:51] argument our sinfulness serves a good
[53:54] purpose for it helps people see how
[53:56] righteous God is isn't it unfair then
[53:58] for God to punish
[54:01] us of course not if God will not
[54:05] entirely fear how would he be qualified
[54:07] to judge the
[54:09] world but some might still argue how can
[54:12] good God condemn me as a sinner if my
[54:15] dishonor highlights his truthfulness and
[54:17] brings him more
[54:19] glory and some people even slander us
[54:22] Jews by claiming that we say the more we
[54:24] sin the better it is
[54:26] those who say such things deserve to be
[54:31] condemned well then should we conclude
[54:34] that we Jews are better than others
[54:36] better than others no not at all for we
[54:39] have already shown that all people where
[54:42] the Jews or Gentiles are under the power
[54:44] of
[54:46] sin as the scripture says None is
[54:49] righteous not even one no one is truly
[54:52] wise no one is seeking after God all
[54:55] have turned away and all have together
[54:57] become
[54:59] worthless there is no one who does good
[55:01] not even one their talk is foul like the
[55:04] stench from an open grave their tongues
[55:06] are filled with lies snake venom drips
[55:08] from their lips their mouths are full of
[55:10] cursing and bitterness they rush to
[55:12] commit murder destruction and misery
[55:14] always follow them the way of peace they
[55:18] do not know they have no fear of God at
[55:22] all now the purpose of the law is to
[55:26] keep people from having excuses and to
[55:29] show that the entire world is guilty
[55:31] before God no one can ever be made right
[55:34] with God by doing what the law
[55:39] commands the law simply shows us how
[55:42] sinful we
[55:46] are but now God has shown us a way to be
[55:51] made right with him without keeping the
[55:54] the requirements of the law as was
[55:56] promised in the writings of Moses and
[55:58] the prophets long
[56:02] ago we are made right with God by
[56:05] placing our faith in Jesus
[56:07] Christ and this is true for everyone who
[56:10] believes no matter who we are Jew or
[56:14] Gentile for everyone has sinned we all
[56:17] fall short of God's glorious
[56:20] standard yet God in his grace freely
[56:23] makes us right in his sight he did this
[56:25] through Christ Jesus when he freed us
[56:28] from the penalty of our
[56:31] sins for God presented Jesus as the
[56:34] sacrifice for sin amen people are made
[56:37] right with God when they believe that
[56:40] Jesus sacrificed his life shedding his
[56:45] blood now this sacrifice shows that God
[56:48] was being feir when he held back and did
[56:50] not punish those who sinned in times
[56:53] past before Christ was on the Earth
[56:57] because he was looking ahead and
[56:58] including them in what he would do in
[57:00] this present time God did this to
[57:03] demonstrate his righteousness for he
[57:05] himself is feir and just and he makes
[57:08] Sinners right in his sight when they
[57:10] believe in
[57:12] Jesus can we boast then that we have
[57:16] done anything to be accepted by
[57:19] God no because our acle is not based on
[57:24] obeying the law it's based on faith
[57:28] Faith so we are made right with God
[57:32] through faith and not by obeying the
[57:35] law after all is God the god of the Jews
[57:38] only that know the
[57:41] law isn't he also the god of the
[57:44] Gentiles of course he is there is one
[57:47] God and he makes right with himself and
[57:50] he makes people right with thems only by
[57:52] faith whether they are Jews or gentiles
[57:57] well then if we emphasize Faith does
[57:59] that mean that we can forget about the
[58:02] law of course not in fact only when we
[58:05] have faith do we truly fulfill the
[58:08] law now Abraham was humanly speaking the
[58:13] founder of our Jewish the Jewish Nation
[58:16] what did he discover about being made
[58:17] right with
[58:19] God if his Good Deeds had made him
[58:22] acceptable to God he would have had
[58:23] something to boast about
[58:48] but that was not God's way for the
[58:51] scripture tells us Abraham believed God
[58:54] and God counted him as right
[58:56] because of his
[58:58] faith when people work their wages are
[59:01] not a gift but something that they've
[59:05] earned but people accounted as righteous
[59:08] not because of their work but because of
[59:11] their faith in God who forgives
[59:13] sins and
[59:15] David David also spoke of this when he
[59:19] described the happiness of those who are
[59:20] declared righteous without working for
[59:22] it blessed are those whose Lawless Deeds
[59:24] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[59:27] yes what joy for those whose
[59:29] record the Lord has cleared of
[59:32] sin still with
[59:35] me now is this blessing only for the
[59:38] Jews or is it also for the uncircumcised
[59:41] Gentiles
[59:44] amen well then we have been saying that
[59:47] Abraham was counted as righteous by God
[59:49] because of his
[59:51] faith
[59:54] yeah but how did this happened was he
[59:57] counted as righteous only after he was
[59:59] circumcised or was it before he was
[1:00:03] circumcised clearly God accepted Abraham
[1:00:06] before he was
[1:00:09] circumcised circumcision happened
[1:00:11] afterwards and was a sign that Abraham
[1:00:13] had already had faith and that God had
[1:00:15] already accepted him and declared him to
[1:00:18] be righteous even before he was
[1:00:21] circumcised like
[1:00:23] us so then Abraham is the spiritual
[1:00:27] father of those who have faith but have
[1:00:30] not been circumcised they are counted as
[1:00:32] righteous because of their faith and
[1:00:35] Abraham is also the spiritual father of
[1:00:37] those who have been circumcised but only
[1:00:40] if they have the same kind of Faith
[1:00:42] Abraham had before he was
[1:00:46] circumcised it was not through the law
[1:00:48] that Abraham and his offspring received
[1:00:50] the promise that he would be heir of the
[1:00:52] world but through the righteousness that
[1:00:54] comes by faith
[1:00:58] and if I might ask if God's promise is
[1:01:01] only for those who obey the law then
[1:01:05] faith is not necessary and the promise
[1:01:06] is
[1:01:09] pointless for the law always brings
[1:01:12] punishment on those who try to obey it
[1:01:16] the only way to avoid breaking the law
[1:01:18] is to have no law to
[1:01:20] break
[1:01:22] amen so the promise is received by faith
[1:01:25] it is given as a free gift and we are
[1:01:28] certain and we are all certain to
[1:01:30] receive it whether or not we live
[1:01:32] according to the law of Moses if we have
[1:01:35] faith like Abraham's for Abraham is the
[1:01:37] father of all who
[1:01:40] believe this is what the scriptures mean
[1:01:43] when God told him I have made you a
[1:01:44] father of many nations this happened
[1:01:47] because Abraham believed and the God who
[1:01:50] brings the dead to life and who creates
[1:01:53] new things out of nothing which is what
[1:01:56] he does for
[1:01:57] us even when there was no reason for
[1:02:00] Hope Abraham kept hoping believing that
[1:02:02] he would become the father of many
[1:02:04] nations for God said to him your seed
[1:02:06] will be like the sand on the
[1:02:09] seashore without weaking in his faith he
[1:02:11] fa the fact that his body was as good as
[1:02:13] dead since he was about 100 years
[1:02:16] old and Sarah's womb was also dead yet
[1:02:20] he didn't waver through unbelief
[1:02:23] regarding the promise of God but was
[1:02:24] strengthened in his faith and gave glory
[1:02:26] to God
[1:02:28] hallelujah he was fully convinced that
[1:02:31] God is able to do whatever he
[1:02:35] promises and because of Abraham's faith
[1:02:38] God counted him as
[1:02:43] righteous and when God counted him as
[1:02:45] righteous it wasn't just for Abraham's
[1:02:47] benefit it was recorded for our benefit
[1:02:50] too assuring us that God will also count
[1:02:55] us as right righteous if we believe in
[1:02:57] him the one who raised Jesus our lord
[1:03:00] from the dead
[1:03:02] amen he was delivered over to death for
[1:03:06] our sins and was raised to life for our
[1:03:09] justification yes sir Lord therefore
[1:03:13] since we've been made right with God
[1:03:16] made right since we've been made right
[1:03:18] in God's sight by faith we have peace
[1:03:20] with God because of what Jesus Christ
[1:03:22] Our Lord has done for us because of our
[1:03:25] faith Christ has brought us into a place
[1:03:27] of undeserved privilege where now we
[1:03:30] stand and we confidently and joyfully
[1:03:33] look forward to sharing God's
[1:03:38] glory might I add we can Rejoice too
[1:03:40] when we run into problems and
[1:03:42] trials for we know that they help us
[1:03:45] develop
[1:03:46] endurance and endurance develops
[1:03:48] strength of character and character
[1:03:50] strengthens our confident hope of
[1:03:52] salvation
[1:03:55] and this hope will not lead to
[1:03:57] disappointment for we know how dearly
[1:04:00] God loves us because he has given us the
[1:04:02] Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his
[1:04:04] love receive that this
[1:04:07] morning when we were utterly
[1:04:11] helpless Christ came at just the right
[1:04:14] time and died for us
[1:04:16] sinners praise the
[1:04:19] Lord now most people would not be
[1:04:22] willing to die for an okay person
[1:04:26] though someone perhaps maybe might be
[1:04:30] willing to die for a person that's
[1:04:31] especially
[1:04:36] good but God demonstrates his own love
[1:04:39] for us while we were still sinners
[1:04:43] Christ died for
[1:04:46] us and since we've been made right in
[1:04:49] God's sight by the blood of Christ he
[1:04:50] will certainly save us from God's
[1:04:52] condemnation
[1:04:56] because think about it if when we were
[1:04:59] God's enemies we were reconciled to him
[1:05:02] through the death of his son how much
[1:05:04] more having been reconciled and made his
[1:05:06] friend shall we be saved through his
[1:05:09] life amen GL so now we can rejoice in
[1:05:13] our wonderful new relationship with God
[1:05:15] because our Lord Jesus Christ has made
[1:05:17] us friends of
[1:05:22] Goden okay now when Adam sinned sin
[1:05:26] entered into the
[1:05:28] world Adam's sin brought death so death
[1:05:31] spread to everyone for everyone
[1:05:34] sinned because we're all seed of
[1:05:37] Adam now to be sure sin was in the world
[1:05:40] before the law was given but sin is not
[1:05:43] charged against anyone's account where
[1:05:45] there is no
[1:05:46] law still everyone died from the time of
[1:05:50] Adam to the time of Moses when the law
[1:05:52] came even those who did not disobey an
[1:05:55] explicit commandment of God as Adam
[1:05:59] did now Adam is a symbol a
[1:06:03] representation of Christ who is yet to
[1:06:05] come you still with me praise the Lord
[1:06:08] You're Going Through Romans
[1:06:12] 1:8 now Adam is a symbol a
[1:06:15] representation of Christ who is yet to
[1:06:16] come for there is a great difference
[1:06:19] between Adam's sin and God's gracious
[1:06:22] gift for the sin of this one man Adam
[1:06:26] brought death to
[1:06:27] many but even greater is God's Wonderful
[1:06:30] Grace and his gift of forgiveness to
[1:06:32] many through this other man Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ and the result of God's gracious
[1:06:39] gift is very different from the result
[1:06:42] of that one man's sin for Adam's sin led
[1:06:44] to
[1:06:47] condemnation but God's free gift leads
[1:06:51] to our being made right with God even
[1:06:53] though we are guilty of many sins
[1:06:58] for the sin of this one man Adam caused
[1:07:01] death to rule over
[1:07:03] many but even greater is God's Wonderful
[1:07:06] Grace and his gift of righteousness for
[1:07:08] all who receive it will live in triumph
[1:07:11] over sin and death through this one man
[1:07:13] Jesus
[1:07:16] Christ yes Adam's sin brings
[1:07:19] condemnation for
[1:07:21] everyone but Christ's one act of
[1:07:23] righteousness brings a right
[1:07:25] relationship ship with God and new life
[1:07:27] for everyone that
[1:07:29] believes because one person disobeyed
[1:07:32] many became Sinners but because one
[1:07:35] other person obeyed God many will be
[1:07:37] made
[1:07:38] righteous GL God's law was given so that
[1:07:42] all people could see how sinful they
[1:07:45] were but as people sinned more and more
[1:07:49] God's Wonderful Grace became more
[1:07:52] abundant
[1:07:55] just as Sin ruled over all people and
[1:07:58] brought them to death now God's
[1:08:00] Wonderful Grace rules instead giving us
[1:08:03] right standing with God and resulting in
[1:08:05] eternal life through Jesus Christ Our
[1:08:08] Lord prise the lord well then should we
[1:08:12] keep on sinning so that God can show us
[1:08:14] more and more of his Wonderful
[1:08:17] Grace of course not since we have died
[1:08:20] to sin how can we continue to live in
[1:08:23] it do you know that all all of us who
[1:08:26] were baptized into Christ Jesus were
[1:08:27] baptized into his
[1:08:30] death because we are buried with him
[1:08:32] through
[1:08:35] baptism through baptism into death in
[1:08:38] order that just as Christ was raised
[1:08:40] from the dead through the glory through
[1:08:42] the glory of the father we too may live
[1:08:44] a new
[1:08:47] life because if we have been United with
[1:08:53] him this is just loading because if we
[1:08:57] have been United with him in a death
[1:09:00] like his we will certainly also be
[1:09:01] United with him in a resurrection like
[1:09:05] his we know that our old sinful selves
[1:09:08] were crucified with Christ so that sin
[1:09:10] might lose its power in our lives we're
[1:09:13] no longer slaves to sin because anybody
[1:09:15] who has died from sin has been set free
[1:09:17] amen this is not
[1:09:21] working come here
[1:09:25] just stand up for a
[1:09:27] minute Shake around move around a bit I
[1:09:30] want you to stay I want you to stay with
[1:09:32] me can you just get this thing here G
[1:09:35] yeah I know you are but you
[1:09:38] know there's some there's there's the
[1:09:40] part I want to get to us at the
[1:09:46] end when you go through this you realize
[1:09:49] it's nothing we've done it's everything
[1:09:50] that he's done it's just Amazing Grace I
[1:09:53] can't earn this I can't I can't do
[1:09:55] anything in My Own Strength my own Deeds
[1:09:58] to please God all I can do is believe
[1:10:01] that's right and accept what he's done
[1:10:03] it's all I can do I don't have any I
[1:10:06] can't say Lord I've done this and this
[1:10:07] therefore accept me he's not interested
[1:10:09] in that whatsoever and there's just it's
[1:10:11] just he's uninterested you we must have
[1:10:14] faith in Jesus Christ forgiveness of sin
[1:10:17] that's the only way we get accepted and
[1:10:19] but when we go that way there's just
[1:10:21] this unmar grace and favor and blessing
[1:10:24] of God that just gets poured out like an
[1:10:27] abundant waterfall Upon Our Lives just
[1:10:29] forgiving us and cleansing us and and
[1:10:32] renewing
[1:10:36] Us Praise the Lord I've got one back
[1:10:40] okay move around a bit jump up and down
[1:10:42] get the yep now you can sit back down
[1:10:44] again praise the Lord
[1:11:02] okay I'm going to go back to oh man I'm
[1:11:05] going to go back to the one before that
[1:11:07] or did you click on
[1:11:12] that yeah thank
[1:11:19] you okay let's go back to this one for
[1:11:22] if we have been United with him in death
[1:11:25] like his we will certainly also be
[1:11:27] United with him in a resurrection like
[1:11:29] his we know that our old sinful selves
[1:11:32] were crucified with Christ so that sin
[1:11:34] might lose its power in our lives we are
[1:11:37] no longer slaves to sin because anyone
[1:11:39] who has died has been set free from
[1:11:42] sin now we are sure of
[1:11:45] this because Christ was raised from the
[1:11:48] dead and he will never die again death
[1:11:50] no longer has any power over him when he
[1:11:54] died he died once to break the power of
[1:11:56] sin but now that he lives he lives for
[1:11:58] the glory of
[1:12:00] God so you also should consider
[1:12:03] yourselves to be dead to the power of
[1:12:05] sin and alive to God through Christ
[1:12:08] Jesus therefore don't let sin control
[1:12:11] the way you live do not give into sinful
[1:12:15] desires do not let any part of your body
[1:12:18] become an instrument of evil to serve
[1:12:20] sin instead gives yourselves completely
[1:12:23] to God for you were dead but now you
[1:12:27] have new life so use your whole body as
[1:12:30] an instrument to do what is right for
[1:12:33] the glory of God
[1:12:35] Amen sin is no longer your master for
[1:12:38] you no longer live under the
[1:12:40] requirements of the law instead you live
[1:12:43] under the freedom of God's
[1:12:46] grace What then shall we sin because we
[1:12:50] are not under the law but under grace by
[1:12:53] no means
[1:12:55] do you realize that you become a the
[1:12:57] slave of whatever you choose to obey you
[1:13:00] can be a slave to sin which leads to
[1:13:02] death or you can choose to obey God
[1:13:05] which leads to righteous
[1:13:07] living thank God once you were slaves of
[1:13:11] sin but now you wholeheartedly obey this
[1:13:15] gospel we have given you now you from
[1:13:18] your now you are free from your slavery
[1:13:20] to sin and you have become slaves of
[1:13:23] righteous living
[1:13:26] now because of the weakness of your
[1:13:28] human nature I'm using this illustration
[1:13:29] of Slavery to help you understand all
[1:13:31] this okay previously you let yourselves
[1:13:35] be slaves to impurity and lawlessness
[1:13:38] which led to even deeper
[1:13:40] sin now you must give yourselves to be
[1:13:43] slaves to righteous living so that you
[1:13:45] will become
[1:13:49] holy when you were slaves to sin you
[1:13:51] were free from the obligation to do
[1:13:53] right what benefit did you reap at that
[1:13:56] time from the things that you are now
[1:13:57] ashamed of those things result in
[1:14:01] death but now you are free from the
[1:14:04] power of sin and become slaves of God
[1:14:06] now you do those things that lead to
[1:14:08] Holiness and result in eternal
[1:14:11] life because the wages of sin is death
[1:14:14] but the gift of God is eternal life in
[1:14:17] Christ Jesus our
[1:14:19] lord now you who are familiar with the
[1:14:22] law of
[1:14:23] Moses don't you know that the law only
[1:14:26] applies while a person is
[1:14:28] living for example when a woman marries
[1:14:32] the law binds her to her husband as long
[1:14:35] as he lives but if he dies the law of
[1:14:38] marriage no longer the laws of marriage
[1:14:41] no longer apply to her okay so while her
[1:14:45] husband is alive she would be committing
[1:14:47] adultery if she married another man but
[1:14:50] if your husband dies she is free from
[1:14:52] that law and does not commit adultery
[1:14:54] when she REM
[1:14:57] marries so my dear brothers and sisters
[1:14:59] this is the point you died to the power
[1:15:01] of the law when you died with Christ and
[1:15:04] now you are united with the one who has
[1:15:06] raised from the dead as a result we can
[1:15:09] produce a harvest of Good Deeds for God
[1:15:13] Amen when we were controlled by our old
[1:15:15] nature sinful desires were at work
[1:15:17] within us and the
[1:15:20] law and the law aroused those evil
[1:15:23] desires that produced a harvest of
[1:15:25] sinful Deeds resulting in death the
[1:15:30] law but now we have been release from
[1:15:33] the law for we died to it and are no
[1:15:36] longer captive to its power now we can
[1:15:39] serve God not in the old way of obeying
[1:15:42] the letter of the law but in the new way
[1:15:44] of living in the
[1:15:47] spirit well then am I suggesting that
[1:15:50] the law of God is
[1:15:52] sinful of course not in fact it was the
[1:15:56] law that showed me my sin I would never
[1:15:59] have known that coveting is wrong if the
[1:16:01] law had not said you must not
[1:16:05] cover but don't miss this sin used this
[1:16:10] command to arouse all kinds of covetous
[1:16:13] desires within
[1:16:15] me if there were no law sin would have
[1:16:18] not have that
[1:16:22] power at one time I love without
[1:16:25] understanding the law but when I learned
[1:16:27] the command not to covet for instance
[1:16:30] the power of sin came to life and I
[1:16:34] died so I discovered that the Law's
[1:16:38] commands which were supposed to bring
[1:16:41] life brought spiritual death
[1:16:44] instead sin took advantage of those
[1:16:47] commands and deceived me it used the
[1:16:51] commands to kill me
[1:16:55] but still the law in itself is
[1:16:59] Holy and its Commandments Are Holy and
[1:17:02] right and
[1:17:06] good but how can it be did the law which
[1:17:10] is good cause my
[1:17:12] death of course
[1:17:15] not sin used what was good to bring
[1:17:19] about my condemnation to
[1:17:22] death so now we can see how terrible sin
[1:17:26] really is it uses God's good commands
[1:17:30] for its own evil purposes it condemns me
[1:17:33] because I break the law and yet sin
[1:17:35] causes me to do
[1:17:37] it so the trouble is not with the law
[1:17:41] for it is spiritual and good the trouble
[1:17:45] is with me for I Am All Too Human a
[1:17:49] slave to
[1:17:52] sin I don't really understand myself for
[1:17:56] I want to do what is right but I don't
[1:18:00] do
[1:18:01] it instead I do what I
[1:18:06] hate but if I know that what I'm doing
[1:18:09] is
[1:18:10] wrong this shows that I agree that the
[1:18:13] Lord is
[1:18:17] good so I am not the one doing it it is
[1:18:21] sin living in me that does it
[1:18:27] and I know that nothing good lives in me
[1:18:30] that is in my sinful
[1:18:33] nature I want to do what is right but I
[1:18:38] can't this is Paul I want to do what is
[1:18:42] good but I
[1:18:45] don't I don't want to do what is wrong
[1:18:49] but I do it
[1:18:53] anyway but if I do what I don't want to
[1:18:56] do I am not really the one doing wrong
[1:18:59] it's sin living in me that does it
[1:19:05] amen but if I do what I don't want to
[1:19:09] do it's that's it's a repeat let's
[1:19:12] repeat it I am not really the one doing
[1:19:14] wrong it is sin living in me that does
[1:19:17] it I've discovered this principle of
[1:19:20] life that when I want to do what is
[1:19:23] right I am inevitably do what is
[1:19:27] wrong do you find that
[1:19:30] amen now I love God's law with all my
[1:19:33] heart and all my
[1:19:36] mind but there's another power within me
[1:19:39] that's at war with my
[1:19:41] mind this power makes me a slave to the
[1:19:44] sin that is still Within
[1:19:47] Me Oh What a miserable person that I am
[1:19:50] who will free me from this life that is
[1:19:52] dominated by sin and death
[1:19:56] thanks be to God who delivers me through
[1:20:00] Jesus Christ Our Lord so then I myself
[1:20:03] in my mind am a slave to God's law but
[1:20:06] in my sinful nature a slave to the law
[1:20:08] of
[1:20:10] sin you'll see this there is therefore
[1:20:13] now no
[1:20:15] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[1:20:17] Jesus who don't walk according to the
[1:20:20] flesh but according to the spirit
[1:20:25] and because you belong to
[1:20:29] him the power of the lifegiving
[1:20:34] spirit has freed you from the power that
[1:20:37] leads to
[1:20:43] death this is what I want you to get the
[1:20:45] law of Moses was unable to save us
[1:20:50] because of the weakness of our sinful
[1:20:53] nature we we were never able to achieve
[1:20:56] the demands of the law because there was
[1:20:59] a sinful nature in us that soon as we
[1:21:01] knew the law the sinful nature took
[1:21:04] advantage of that and started to disobey
[1:21:07] that willingly and try harder and harder
[1:21:10] to disobey
[1:21:11] that so the law was unable to actually
[1:21:15] achieve anything for
[1:21:17] us it could achieve
[1:21:19] nothing so God did what the law could
[1:21:23] not do he sent his own son in a body
[1:21:27] like the bodies we Sinners have and in
[1:21:31] that body God declared an end to sin's
[1:21:34] control over Us by giving us his son as
[1:21:39] a sacrifice for our
[1:21:43] sins you'll get this in this one he did
[1:21:46] this so that the just requirement of the
[1:21:48] law would be fully satisfied for us now
[1:21:52] the law has no claim over us amen
[1:21:56] therefore sin can no longer use the law
[1:21:58] to condemn us amen do you understand
[1:22:02] because sin that dwelt in US was always
[1:22:04] disobeying the law so what God did was
[1:22:07] he came down and he took away that
[1:22:09] penalty of sin that he he he abolished
[1:22:13] that so that the law had no hold or
[1:22:16] claim over us so sin could not use the
[1:22:18] law to have claim over us because
[1:22:22] according to the law we were pure and
[1:22:24] righteous
[1:22:26] so sin had no claim we were free so now
[1:22:30] we can just we say I'm free we we were
[1:22:31] totally free now we can just now we can
[1:22:34] walk in the newness of life because
[1:22:35] there's now no
[1:22:37] condemnation he he went right down to
[1:22:39] the source God went to the source and
[1:22:41] broke the source of it so sin cannot
[1:22:43] condemn us any
[1:22:45] longer we no longer follow our sinful
[1:22:48] nature but instead follow the
[1:22:51] spirit yeah so letting your sinful
[1:22:56] nature control your mind leads to
[1:22:59] death but letting the spirit control
[1:23:01] your mind leads to life and peace I'm
[1:23:04] just going to preach for a couple of
[1:23:05] minutes because we we've almost got to
[1:23:07] the end of that I want to explain this
[1:23:09] to you so you know this you know this
[1:23:11] really good there are three powers that
[1:23:14] we contend with that are in existence in
[1:23:16] the world there's three powers there's
[1:23:18] the power of
[1:23:20] God well there's four but I'll go with
[1:23:22] the three there's the power of God
[1:23:25] there is the power of our
[1:23:26] mind and there's the power of our sinful
[1:23:29] flesh now all of these three have power
[1:23:32] in themselves but they all have a a
[1:23:36] power system where some are more
[1:23:37] powerful than others our mind just
[1:23:40] happens to be down the bottom the least
[1:23:43] powerful the the the sin that works in
[1:23:46] US is the next powerful and the god the
[1:23:48] power of God is the the most powerful do
[1:23:51] you
[1:23:53] understand so now I've lost my train of
[1:23:56] thought
[1:23:58] if okay I'll get it I'll get it back
[1:24:04] again I be I was I think I could talk
[1:24:07] about
[1:24:16] this now let's just let's finish on that
[1:24:18] let's go with this one here then I'll go
[1:24:20] back to
[1:24:22] that for the sinful nature is always
[1:24:25] hostile to God it never did obey God's
[1:24:28] laws and it never will that's why those
[1:24:31] who are still under the control of their
[1:24:32] sinful nature can never please
[1:24:36] God okay but you are not controlled by
[1:24:39] your sinful nature you are controlled by
[1:24:42] the spirit if you have the spirit of God
[1:24:44] living in you amen and remember that
[1:24:46] those who do not have the spirit of
[1:24:48] Christ Living in them do not belong to
[1:24:50] him at
[1:24:52] all okay so this only works the whole
[1:24:57] thing revolves around our mind deciding
[1:24:59] to accept God and then God's spirit
[1:25:01] coming and living in our life and then
[1:25:02] our mind surrendering to that spirit and
[1:25:05] through the power of the Holy Ghost we
[1:25:09] overcome the power of our sinful
[1:25:12] nature that's why the Bible says walk in
[1:25:14] the spirit and you will not fulfill the
[1:25:16] lust of the flesh you cannot be a
[1:25:19] Christian unless you have the spirit of
[1:25:21] God living in you you cannot overcome
[1:25:25] okay
[1:25:26] so don't think that if you try harder if
[1:25:29] you fail in your mind and if you if I
[1:25:31] try harder I'll do better it's not about
[1:25:34] that it's I'll surrender more to the
[1:25:36] spirit of God then I'll overcome more
[1:25:38] that's how you
[1:25:40] overcome you cannot train this body to
[1:25:42] be this sinful nature that's in you to
[1:25:44] be good but remember God's taken away
[1:25:47] the peny of it there's no condemnation
[1:25:50] you can walk in newness of life you can
[1:25:51] receive the Holy Ghost you can walk in
[1:25:53] his spirit you can just go from strength
[1:25:55] to strength and just go rejoicing that's
[1:25:57] who we are as Christians that's what all
[1:26:00] the Romans 1: 18 is talking about this
[1:26:01] is what you have is saying you're free
[1:26:03] from sin you're free from Death you're
[1:26:05] free from all that he's given you the
[1:26:07] Holy Ghost you can just walk in the
[1:26:08] newness of life don't be condemned by
[1:26:10] anything because God has paid the price
[1:26:12] of all your sins he's taken all your
[1:26:14] condemnation away you're not under the
[1:26:16] law you don't have to do anything to try
[1:26:18] and please God that's all been he paid
[1:26:20] the price of his own law that's all been
[1:26:21] done away with sin cannot accuse you now
[1:26:24] can't he can't say look you have sinned
[1:26:26] according to this law because you're
[1:26:27] sinless then you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:26:30] you walk in the newness of life and you
[1:26:32] overcome the works of the Flesh and you
[1:26:34] live out the law of God by the spirit of
[1:26:36] God that's dwelling in you and that's
[1:26:38] how the gospel works that's the
[1:26:40] overcoming power of the gospel and
[1:26:43] Christ lives within you so even though
[1:26:45] your body will die because of sin the
[1:26:47] spirit gives you life because you have
[1:26:49] been made right with God and if the
[1:26:52] spirit of him who raised Jesus from the
[1:26:53] dead is living in you he who raised
[1:26:56] Christ from the dead will also give life
[1:26:57] to your mortal bodies because of his
[1:26:59] Spirit who lives in you amen
[1:27:02] and that's why I said here and this I
[1:27:06] say them walk in the spirit and you
[1:27:08] shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:27:10] am so this is actually this is what we
[1:27:14] have as Believers we don't have to earn
[1:27:16] anything we don't have to try hard for
[1:27:18] anything we just have to accept by faith
[1:27:20] what he's done for us accept it all by
[1:27:22] faith don't don't think of I'm a bit
[1:27:24] better then I'll I'll earn a little bit
[1:27:26] more it's got nothing to do with it amen
[1:27:29] there is no way our Good Deeds can ever
[1:27:32] pay the price of our
[1:27:34] sin but God and his great Mercy has made
[1:27:37] a way for us so we do not have to walk
[1:27:41] around and we do not have to walk around
[1:27:43] unbelief and ever let the devil get one
[1:27:45] over on
[1:27:46] us because that's unbelief and who did
[1:27:49] who did we just find out that we were we
[1:27:51] were sons of Abraham and Abraham
[1:27:53] believed God and he knew that God could
[1:27:55] a raise people from the dead B make
[1:27:58] things that weren't as though they were
[1:28:00] so that's what we have we we we believe
[1:28:04] the same way so if we we can believe
[1:28:06] Lord You Raised Me from the dead you
[1:28:08] make something new out of me the moment
[1:28:10] we give to unbelief and let sin condemn
[1:28:13] us that's Satan's got us where he wants
[1:28:16] us but we don't live like that because
[1:28:17] we're Believers we never let Satan have
[1:28:20] that over us we always believe we we're
[1:28:23] we're creatures of faith
[1:28:25] you know that and we know that this is
[1:28:28] the truth because when we look around at
[1:28:29] the world now we see that the sinful
[1:28:32] nature of man is hiding just below the
[1:28:35] mental capacity to control it do you
[1:28:38] understand that if you the sinful nature
[1:28:41] of man is so evil but it's it's it's
[1:28:44] held back by the mental ability to
[1:28:46] control the sinful
[1:28:49] nature that's why they do experiments
[1:28:52] any sort of experiment that they do that
[1:28:55] for
[1:28:56] instance why does someone when they're
[1:28:58] walking down the street are not as
[1:28:59] aggressive as what they are when they're
[1:29:00] driving in a car why is
[1:29:03] that because when you're walking along a
[1:29:06] street your mind will tell you I'm not
[1:29:08] as powerful as what I can be there's
[1:29:10] reasoning why you can't just yell at the
[1:29:12] person if he's taking up some of your
[1:29:14] lane you don't just say get out of the
[1:29:16] way because he might be bigger than you
[1:29:19] whatever it might be you're less
[1:29:20] aggressive because you've got nothing
[1:29:22] there to
[1:29:25] in your mind you think I cannot do this
[1:29:28] I can't say anything I'm I'm your mind
[1:29:31] is controlling your sinful nature when
[1:29:32] you're in a car whether you're a guy or
[1:29:35] a girl all you have to do is touch the
[1:29:36] accelerator and you go faster how does
[1:29:39] that make you feel
[1:29:41] powerful you're more powerful you've got
[1:29:43] this ability now to be more powerful to
[1:29:46] you know so then the reasoning in your
[1:29:48] mind you think I can yell at that person
[1:29:50] then I'll just carry on driving see so
[1:29:53] the carnal nature can bubble out of we
[1:29:55] bit now this is I'm not making this up
[1:29:58] this is facts cuz they see why are
[1:29:59] people more aggressive in AAR and the
[1:30:01] other thing was when people can't be
[1:30:04] seen they get even more evil that's why
[1:30:07] there's so much smut on the internet
[1:30:08] people that keyboard Warriors because
[1:30:10] it's anonymity why because the mind
[1:30:12] thinks oh no one's going to see this so
[1:30:13] then this the nature comes out more it's
[1:30:16] sitting right there at the surface they
[1:30:18] did experiments where they would have
[1:30:22] prisoners and prison oh no
[1:30:25] prisoners and prison guards they said
[1:30:26] you'll be the prisoners and you'll be
[1:30:28] the prison guards and it took six days
[1:30:31] for these normal people to turn into
[1:30:33] almost animals to these the prison the
[1:30:36] guards to turn into animals towards the
[1:30:37] prisoners six days because in their mind
[1:30:40] they convinced themselves well I'm a I'm
[1:30:41] the right guy here and he's the wrong
[1:30:43] guy and I'm in charge of him and they it
[1:30:45] just they were surprised at how long it
[1:30:47] took them to become evil evil is sitting
[1:30:50] right
[1:30:51] there right there at the surface and
[1:30:54] and it's it's just bubbling near the top
[1:30:57] and now we've had it we've had a nice
[1:30:59] Society because it's been held back by
[1:31:01] mental thinking of what's right and
[1:31:03] wrong because there's been Christianity
[1:31:05] around that's told people in their mind
[1:31:08] I should do this I should do that this
[1:31:09] what's right and it's held back the
[1:31:11] sinful nature but it's bubbling right at
[1:31:14] the surface it's coming out more and
[1:31:17] more and more and even that's why when
[1:31:20] there's a riot happens or something like
[1:31:22] that it spreads because suddenly in
[1:31:24] people's minds they think oh well uh I'm
[1:31:26] just a part of this group no one's
[1:31:28] really going to know who I am out comes
[1:31:30] a sinful nature they do things that they
[1:31:31] wouldn't otherwise do they wouldn't walk
[1:31:33] down the street and smash a window on a
[1:31:35] shop front because their mind tells them
[1:31:38] don't do it it's just them by themselves
[1:31:40] but when they're in a group and they're
[1:31:41] caught up in this emotion of it and the
[1:31:43] mind loses its ability to control the
[1:31:45] sinful nature what do they do they'll
[1:31:49] smash that window the same person it
[1:31:51] might take all of an hour to get to that
[1:31:53] state
[1:31:55] even
[1:31:57] when
[1:31:58] people you you won't believe this but
[1:32:01] when people are going to if people are
[1:32:02] jumping on a bridge to jump off and
[1:32:03] commit
[1:32:05] suicide people will start encouraging
[1:32:07] them to jump and when they do it sort of
[1:32:09] spreads among the crowd and they're all
[1:32:10] encouraging the person to jump It's
[1:32:11] common the police know this so they have
[1:32:14] to actually get people back out of
[1:32:16] airshot of the
[1:32:19] person but it takes one person to do it
[1:32:21] and then it just all that the sinful
[1:32:23] nature just
[1:32:24] why because they're
[1:32:25] murderers they they our sinful nature is
[1:32:28] a murderer first chance you give it
[1:32:30] it'll
[1:32:34] murder it's just it's sitting right
[1:32:36] there and and man is trying to figure
[1:32:38] out all sorts of ways to control it in
[1:32:40] the society that we live in but the
[1:32:42] things that they're doing are not
[1:32:44] working because the because the only way
[1:32:47] to control it is to receive the spirit
[1:32:48] of Christ in us and receive a new life
[1:32:51] the second best way to control it is to
[1:32:52] be governed by the laws and principles
[1:32:54] of God in a society but we're doing away
[1:32:56] with those two so we're seeing carnal
[1:32:59] nature bubbling at the
[1:33:00] surface all around and and and now doing
[1:33:03] things that we wouldn't do before things
[1:33:06] are happening in society that wouldn't
[1:33:07] happen before it's what Paul talked
[1:33:10] about this carnal
[1:33:12] nature but praise God we've been made
[1:33:14] free from this carnal nature we've been
[1:33:16] God has Set Me Free he's he's he's the
[1:33:19] spirit of Christ that's in me has
[1:33:20] overcome that I'm not what I used to be
[1:33:23] ain't what I want to be but ain't what I
[1:33:24] used to be this this we are the most
[1:33:27] Victorious people on Earth because
[1:33:29] through Christ through the spirit of God
[1:33:31] our carnal nature is subdued it's been
[1:33:34] overcome and we can and we are totally
[1:33:37] free from all the penalty of sin
[1:33:39] everything and we can walk in the uness
[1:33:40] of life and don't think that God doesn't
[1:33:44] mind you to young young people God wants
[1:33:46] to give you the Holy Ghost you just Lord
[1:33:47] just receive he he just wants that's his
[1:33:49] whole plan it's that's just like yep
[1:33:51] that that that there you go all he wants
[1:33:54] for you is a totally repentant heart and
[1:33:56] 100% commitment to
[1:33:58] him I'm going to close after I say this
[1:34:00] thought but that's it seems to be when
[1:34:04] you study the prerequisite for receiving
[1:34:06] the holy ghost that seems to be a the
[1:34:09] thing that will stop anyone's
[1:34:10] unwillingness to have a total surrender
[1:34:13] right because what is the Bible saying
[1:34:15] here it says we're a slave to Christ
[1:34:18] slave just gives over all their rights
[1:34:20] yep I fully surrender now I'm a slave so
[1:34:23] that's the the only thing that I've seen
[1:34:25] that would cause someone to not fully
[1:34:26] enter in is that they don't fully
[1:34:28] surrender that's the only thing like the
[1:34:30] Rich Young Ruler he was doing all these
[1:34:32] things and Jesus said one thing you lack
[1:34:34] just do this one
[1:34:36] thing but he didn't want to do it amen
[1:34:39] other people came oh I've got these
[1:34:41] houses and things he said follow me ah
[1:34:43] yeah I will but I've just got to look
[1:34:44] after my houses first he said don't
[1:34:47] worry about that come follow me when
[1:34:48] they had to make a choice they didn't
[1:34:50] want 100% surrender but those of us that
[1:34:53] really love the Lord we can say Lord of
[1:34:55] to whom shall I go you alone have the
[1:34:57] words of eternal life 100% surrender if
[1:34:59] you search in your heart and you know
[1:35:01] that that's in your heart you got it
[1:35:02] just walk in Praise the Lord the Lord
[1:35:04] will just pour His Spirit out upon you
[1:35:06] forgive you of all your sins you just
[1:35:07] walk in the newness of life it's just
[1:35:08] the journey it's the it's the tried and
[1:35:11] true Journey so don't fear don't have
[1:35:14] doubt don't don't let Satan pull you
[1:35:16] away from it it's just all there for you
[1:35:19] just walk in it amen and if in your
[1:35:20] heart you say Lord I'm going to receive
[1:35:22] I'm going to accept you with all of my
[1:35:23] heart just walk in it amen just receive
[1:35:25] it amen let's um let's um stand up this
[1:35:29] morning so you just read Romans 1 1 to8
[1:35:33] now when you go back and read it again
[1:35:35] you'll be like oh yeah there it is there
[1:35:36] there it is there but sometimes the you
[1:35:38] know when you put it together it says a
[1:35:40] few different things let's can I have

[1:35:59] your for your word Lord that for your
[1:36:04] promises that we can
[1:36:06] see Lord that you've made this complete
[1:36:09] and total salvation for us Lord Jesus
[1:36:13] Lord that that we don't have to walk in
[1:36:15] any sort of condemnation Lord but we can
[1:36:17] walk in complete faith and what you've
[1:36:19] done for us Lord Jesus we can walk in
[1:36:21] the newness of Life Lord by your Holy
[1:36:24] Ghost Lord and and Lord those of us that

[1:36:30] doesn't know you like that yet Lord may
[1:36:32] they just let go and let you just move
[1:36:34] in their life or may they may they just
[1:36:35] totally surrender to you Lord Jesus
[1:36:37] knowing that you you want us to you
[1:36:41] didn't make this pathway and then and
[1:36:44] then make it hard for us to get on the
[1:36:45] path you just said come Lord come all
[1:36:48] you are thirsty come and I'll give you
[1:36:50] to drink of the Water of Life freely
[1:36:52] Lord we don't have to
[1:36:54] do any big ceremony or do Penance or
[1:36:56] walk up a certain amount of steps or
[1:36:57] anything like that Lord Even in our seat
[1:36:59] right now we can say Lord I come I
[1:37:01] accept you Lord and Lord you if in our
[1:37:04] heart we do 100% then you just come meet

[1:37:14] Lord Jesus so Lord if there's anyone
[1:37:16] here that's struggling this morning with
[1:37:18] maybe in their flesh they're wondering
[1:37:19] why they can never overcome why they
[1:37:20] always struggle with these things Lord
