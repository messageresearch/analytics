[9:44] command
[9:47] the
[9:52] amen God is good isn't he amen how many
[9:55] have been enjoying themselves amen amen
[9:59] about 10 of
[10:01] you so the rest of you came here to eat
[10:05] huh amen God is so good to us amen who
[10:09] would have ever thought that we can
[10:12] gather in the atmosphere enjoy each
[10:14] other dress up and it be centered around
[10:20] Christ you know a lot of times church
[10:23] and Christianity has been
[10:27] misunderstood there there are dos and
[10:30] don'ts young people but when you fall in
[10:33] love with
[10:35] God it's perceived a different way amen
[10:40] your dos and don'ts is a
[10:42] lifestyle and it's not Grievous to you
[10:45] anymore you know I I can say this
[10:48] because I've been in church and I've
[10:49] been in church without the holy spirit
[10:52] for years sitting there and you know the
[10:56] man of God preaching and I'm like man
[10:58] please will you hurry yeah I got
[11:00] something to
[11:02] do you know and that was my mindset and
[11:04] the word is being preached and I'm not
[11:07] hearing anything because my mind is
[11:09] someplace else right but what I love
[11:12] about God when I got to a
[11:14] place where the way I was doing it
[11:18] wasn't working out and all I could do
[11:21] was turn back around amen and Chase out
[11:25] the God Amen all that word I heard word
[11:30] opened up to
[11:31] me so I want I want to say you may be
[11:34] sitting here you may not understand
[11:36] everything but there's a purpose for you
[11:39] being in church amen because eventually
[11:42] if you hit that right spot that right
[11:44] place all that word is going to come
[11:47] full circle and you're going to be like
[11:50] man I heard that before I heard that
[11:52] before praise God this is this is so
[11:55] good you know but it's it's good to be
[11:57] here and I certainly uh appreciate
[12:00] brother Ben and brother AR for you know
[12:03] inviting me and allowing me to come
[12:05] because you know I'm pretty sure a a lot
[12:08] of y'all know I preach a lot of Youth
[12:09] meetings and different things like that
[12:12] and you know why because I'm one of
[12:15] you I'm one of you guys you know I may I
[12:19] may be a tad bit
[12:21] older I noticed I say tad bit but I'm
[12:25] one of you guys and that's what I love
[12:28] about Joshua's
[12:31] Ministry Joshua the reason why he could
[12:34] take them into the promised land is
[12:37] because he was one of them you know he
[12:41] was there when to when when Moses you
[12:43] know went up the mountain and came back
[12:45] down he was there when people talked
[12:48] about Moses the wrong way and all these
[12:50] things but he stayed with the word
[12:53] Joshua stayed with the word and he was
[12:55] there to hear parents say that oh y'all
[12:58] going to die in the wilderness and our
[12:59] children this and our children that but
[13:01] Joshua was like God gave us a promis
[13:04] amen he gave us a promise and and and no
[13:06] doubt Joshua probably tried to encourage
[13:08] some people encourage some people y'all
[13:10] heard what the prophet said y'all heard
[13:12] what he said come on he said that to us
[13:14] amen he said that to us so I know
[13:19] sometimes you feel like you're not a
[13:20] part of this but you are you're a very
[13:23] big part of it amen a very big part of
[13:26] it but that's my lecture now I'm going
[13:29] to get
[13:30] into going to get into some scripture
[13:33] amen how many ready for the
[13:34] word amen and you look good
[13:37] tonight everyone looks good tonight you
[13:40] know y'all know I'm going preach on that
[13:44] right oh yeah you thought you was going
[13:47] to get by n we going we going to preach
[13:49] on that we going to preach on that um
[13:54] Joshua
[13:55] 24 the Bible the Bible says in Joshua
[14:02] 24
[14:05] verse verse
[14:08] 14 I hope I'm in a good spot with the
[14:11] mic y'all hear me all
[14:14] right
[14:16] amen I want you to focus
[14:19] in the food was good we going to eat
[14:21] some spiritual food now
[14:23] yeah
[14:25] Joshua 24 verse4
[14:30] now therefore fear the
[14:35] lord fear the
[14:37] lord fear the lord I wonder how many of
[14:42] you in here fear the
[14:44] lord see what the world what Society is
[14:47] doing they're trying to have a world
[14:50] where there's no Godly
[14:52] fear and you know how they're doing that
[14:55] they're making the world
[14:57] liberal where you can do whatever
[14:59] whatever you want to do and there's no
[15:01] consequences a lot of laws and things
[15:04] that have passed now couldn't have pass
[15:07] years ago because of the fear of
[15:12] God right and when I say the fear of God
[15:15] I'm not talking oh I don't want to go to
[15:17] hell oh I don't want to be amongst
[15:20] demons oh no I'm talking about
[15:23] reverence reverence you reverence God
[15:26] you know what it means to reverence
[15:27] someone you know when I was coming up it
[15:29] was certain things I wouldn't say or do
[15:32] in front of my parents because of
[15:34] reverence yeah but
[15:38] nowadays I don't know about in New
[15:40] Zealand but in the US kids are so
[15:43] disrespectful and they have no reverence
[15:45] no reverence at all they'll tell their
[15:48] parents what they're going to do what
[15:49] they ain't going to do and all these
[15:51] different things you know why because
[15:53] they're making the world
[15:55] liberal and there's no fear there's no
[15:57] Godly fear I I I we would obey our
[16:01] parents because the Bible says honor
[16:04] your
[16:05] parents and you believe that as long as
[16:08] you did that you were okay you were all
[16:11] right and the Bible says that your days
[16:14] may be long upon the
[16:17] land but what society and the world has
[16:20] done is trying to get you guys to live a
[16:22] life without the fear of God the Bible
[16:26] says whatsoever you reap whatsoever you
[16:29] sow you going to reap yeah am that's
[16:32] true I'm here I'm here as a witness to
[16:34] tell you that whatsoever you sow you
[16:38] going to reap amen so let's not take God
[16:41] as some like the prophet of God say some
[16:43] old Doty
[16:45] grandfather let's understand this when
[16:48] God looks at you you know how many of
[16:50] you got
[16:51] parents I hope all of you for those of
[16:55] you who got parents and you know when
[16:57] you stand beside your father if you
[16:59] stand there in front of God he don't see
[17:03] you and your father he see a son and a
[17:07] son right or a son and a daughter or a
[17:10] daughter and a daughter God don't have
[17:13] grandchildren amen amen so it ain't some
[17:16] cycle where you pass certain things down
[17:19] no God deals with you on the same
[17:22] basis as a elected seed amen and you may
[17:26] look at yourself and you may say well
[17:28] brother d I got this going on I got that
[17:30] going on that's what makes God so great
[17:33] amen cuz in the midst of all your trials
[17:36] he can still be
[17:38] God Amen I know him as a deliverer and I
[17:42] and I and I may I may get a little
[17:44] personal for you because I I I I think
[17:47] sometimes y'all young people think you
[17:50] know preachers were born like
[17:54] this just handling the word and praise
[17:57] God and you come out the you come out
[17:59] the womb say th say the
[18:04] Lord your mama said go g honey you
[18:07] hungry you say
[18:09] Amen no we we didn't come out like that
[18:12] amen we didn't come out like that we had
[18:15] to be born again amen we had to get to
[18:19] know the Lord have contact with God you
[18:22] know uhh I can't speak for any other
[18:24] preachers but I made mistakes but God
[18:26] was merciful god was mer first of all
[18:29] cuz there was a desire there even though
[18:32] I was locked I was out there in the
[18:33] world and doing different things in my
[18:35] heart I really wanted to serve God yeah
[18:38] amen amen so let's get that out of your
[18:41] mind no brother digs and whatever
[18:44] preacher you may be looking at as the
[18:46] best preacher in the world he's not
[18:48] Invincible without the grace of God he's
[18:52] just a regular person yeah he's just a
[18:54] sinner amen that's me without the grace
[18:58] of God amen I'm just I'll be sitting in
[19:01] your seat saying Lord I need help yeah
[19:04] amen that's what happens when the grace
[19:06] of God comes your way and you understand
[19:08] it it changes your life and you realize
[19:12] that you're not living on the merits of
[19:15] who you are you're living on the merits
[19:17] of who he is amen you know there's a
[19:20] quote there's a quote and I and I'm
[19:23] I'mma get y'all know I'm just so out of
[19:26] order you know uh uh there's a quote
[19:29] where the prophet of God he he he he
[19:32] he's he's talking about salvation and
[19:34] different things and he talk about he
[19:36] talks about demon powers and all of that
[19:38] he talks about election and and
[19:40] predestination and all these things
[19:42] that's not just for your parents that's
[19:44] for you too amen you're elected you're
[19:48] predestinated amen but you got to get to
[19:50] a place till you know it
[19:53] yeah
[19:55] amen um where was I
[19:59] verse 14 now therefore fear the lord and
[20:03] serve him in sincerity and in truth see
[20:08] that's what that's how you serve God
[20:10] sincere and truth you know the prophet
[20:13] God talk about you know in different
[20:15] countries the women would take their
[20:16] babies and throw them into the to the
[20:18] Alligators or whatever as a sacrifice
[20:21] they were very sincere but that wasn't
[20:26] truth and by God's grace he's giving us
[20:29] truth it's time for us to get
[20:33] sincere now let let me let me let me
[20:36] drop a bum on you for a second right
[20:38] quick you remember the prophet of God
[20:41] the Lord was uh and and some of you may
[20:44] have never read this but you probably
[20:46] have heard it if you was anything like I
[20:48] was you've heard about the prophet heard
[20:50] about the prophet and you heard the
[20:51] quotes and heard the Cru and all these
[20:53] things but you never took the time to go
[20:55] look for it yourself
[20:58] y'all afraid to say
[20:59] Amen don't turn me into a blood hounding
[21:02] here
[21:04] tonight start
[21:06] sniffing but you know
[21:08] uh just like hearing hearing you know
[21:13] God said the prophet and all these
[21:14] things and if God don't open that up to
[21:17] you really it's just hear
[21:22] say it's just hear say you say I heard
[21:25] this I heard that I heard that but when
[21:27] God open that up to you sir on ain't no
[21:31] false Doctrine out there that can shake
[21:33] you ain't no ain't no you know cuz
[21:36] sometimes young people I know you get
[21:37] hurt ain't no hurt that can stop
[21:40] you when God opens up truth to you ain't
[21:44] can't nothing turn you around let me
[21:47] tell you a part of my testimony I come I
[21:49] I wasn't raised in a Christian Home per
[21:52] se you know and some of you are looking
[21:54] like you thinking and you say all I am
[21:57] is just a message baby I born in this
[21:59] message all I know is this message I'm
[22:01] so sick of this message I wish I had a
[22:04] testimony that is a testimony amen that
[22:08] that is a testimony where you've never
[22:10] been in the world you've never been
[22:12] touched you don't have all this filth
[22:15] all over your over your life and over
[22:16] your past that is a testimony amen that
[22:20] is a testimony if if you if your life is
[22:23] still virtuous and and and and you know
[22:25] the things that speaks of Purity in the
[22:27] scriptures that is a testimony don't
[22:31] think that your your life is not
[22:32] powerful because you've never
[22:34] experienced the climaxes of
[22:37] sin your life is powerful because you
[22:40] have
[22:42] it that shows the grace of God that God
[22:45] can keep you right here in Satan's e and

[26:18] marry your
[26:24] mom we came up totally different
[26:31] as y'all can tell me and Steve are good
[26:34] buddies we're good with me and Steve are
[26:36] really good buddies and what he's
[26:39] preaching I've been to his house and
[26:41] I've seen it in action amen and it's the
[26:45] truth it's the truth I go I got like the
[26:48] day when he was preaching I was I was
[26:50] holding back cuz he was supposed to be
[26:51] talking to y'all and you know he was
[26:53] talking to some us I was like oh
[26:55] man that's you know but I realized I had
[26:59] to preach tonight so I trying to reserve
[27:01] my voice you know but that's what
[27:04] happens when you connect with the word
[27:07] you know what I mean it does something
[27:08] to you you know and I I sure enjoy that
[27:11] today and I I want I I encourage y'all
[27:15] see me and brother Steve we not in a
[27:17] popularity contest we not in who going
[27:20] to preach the best you and all that no
[27:22] we have me and him have the same goal we
[27:24] want to see y'all blessed amen we want
[27:27] to see you encouraged in the Lord
[27:30] getting closer to God and whether God
[27:32] use him or God use me the Lord be
[27:36] praised the Lord be praised sir so by no
[27:39] means if I if I say something things
[27:41] different than the way he said I am not
[27:44] trying to take away from what he says
[27:46] because I believe in his life I believe
[27:48] in his gift amen amen and and and and
[27:51] with brother Ben and brother AR as well
[27:53] but I have to be me and that's the
[27:56] greatest revelation can ever get when
[28:00] you know who you are in
[28:04] Christ okay let's go sincerity and truth
[28:08] and put away the gods which your father
[28:11] served on the other side of the flood
[28:14] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and
[28:17] if it seem evil unto you to serve the
[28:20] Lord why would it seem evil to serve
[28:23] God that's what I'm asking you
[28:26] tonight why what is it that's stopping
[28:30] you from fully giving God all of
[28:33] you and listen how Joshua described this
[28:36] he says if it seems evil so obviously
[28:39] there's something about God if you
[28:41] haven't fully given your life yet that
[28:44] you don't think is a big
[28:46] deal so he's saying what is it if if it
[28:49] seems evil to serve the Lord
[28:56] evil serve the Lord use ye this this day
[29:00] whom you serve amen whom you will serve
[29:02] whether the gods which your father serve
[29:05] or whether the others side of the flood
[29:08] or the gods of the amorites in whose
[29:10] land you
[29:12] dwell but as for me in my house we will
[29:15] serve the
[29:17] Lord and tonight by God's
[29:22] grace I want to talk to you about the
[29:25] Power of
[29:26] Choice amen amen making a
[29:30] choice you know in everything you do you
[29:33] got to make a choice a decision
[29:36] amen but this is the thing I I want you
[29:38] to catch
[29:40] tonight about choices and decisions that
[29:43] whatever choice you make whatever
[29:45] decision you make there's a spirit
[29:47] behind it amen there's something
[29:49] motivating you to make that choice
[29:52] there's something motivating you to make
[29:54] that decision so as we go through this I
[29:57] want you I want you to think about
[30:00] what's causing you to make the majority
[30:02] of the decisions you make right you know
[30:05] if if if you know right now we're in a
[30:08] banquet and some of you had to make a
[30:10] choice by what you was going to wear
[30:13] tonight I told you I was going to get
[30:17] you some of you pull out the best suit
[30:20] you can find but not just any kind of
[30:23] suit but something that made you feel a
[30:26] certain way when you look in the mirror
[30:29] that you know you had a certain
[30:32] confidence y'all remember that you had a
[30:35] certain confidence about the clothes you
[30:37] put on and you know you you you you you
[30:40] Brothers put on a certain suit maybe it
[30:42] stands out a little
[30:45] [Music]
[30:49] bit you chose to make that
[30:52] choice but there was something about you
[30:56] making that choice and I hey look I

[32:09] who I am I'm always in church clothes
[32:12] trust me this just this ain't nothing
[32:16] right ain't nothing I ain't want I ain't
[32:19] want nothing to get lost while I'm
[32:21] flying
[32:25] so Hallelujah
[32:28] but you know whatever you put on there's
[32:31] a choice behind it Hallelujah and you
[32:33] know you might have you Brothers might
[32:35] have chose a certain suit and match this
[32:38] color and match that color and what you
[32:39] did was you looked in the mirror at it
[32:42] you ain't just put it on and walk out
[32:43] the house but you looked at yourself you
[32:46] wanted to see what kind of image you was
[32:48] portraying what's going on behind them
[32:50] clothes what are you thinking about you
[32:53] know the same thing with the sisters you
[32:55] chose what kind of dress you was going
[32:56] to put on you know you matched up the
[32:59] colors with your skin and and and and
[33:01] did you know how sisters do all kind of
[33:03] stuff you know what I mean and and and
[33:05] and you matched up this and you matched
[33:07] up that and you had to have the perfect
[33:09] shoes and and oh this is the Clincher
[33:12] you had to make a choice on how you was
[33:14] going to do your
[33:17] hair but there's a Spirit by how you did
[33:20] how you did your hair too
[33:22] now there's a certain way you did your
[33:25] hair because there was something you was
[33:27] looking
[33:29] for you was looking for there was
[33:32] something you was trying to achieve and
[33:35] the and the decision you was making was
[33:38] geared more to that choice or what was
[33:42] pushing you doing that and you know you
[33:45] you easily could have flat IR your hat
[33:47] but you say no I'm going put some curls
[33:49] in this
[33:50] stuff no I I I flat out on regular
[33:54] service but we going to a banquet
[33:58] I'm going I'm going to Jazz this thing
[33:59] up I'm going put some curs in this
[34:02] thing oh I know what I'm talking about
[34:06] and then all that wind start blowing and
[34:07] you start
[34:13] [Music]
[34:14] thinking what were you thinking about my
[34:20] curls decisions choices there was
[34:23] something behind you doing your hair
[34:25] like
[34:26] that and like brother Steve preach
[34:28] there's nothing wrong with that in his
[34:30] innocent
[34:32] form right there's nothing the prophet
[34:34] of God said he they ask him a question
[34:37] should should the sisters wake curs
[34:38] whatever he says is in a woman to want
[34:41] to look nice he says I don't have no
[34:43] scripture for that just don't cut it
[34:46] yeah now for those of you who may be
[34:48] trimming and cutting
[34:51] why there's something behind you pushing
[34:54] that
[34:56] choice and when it's a against the word
[34:58] of God it's an evil
[35:01] spirit pushing you to make that
[35:04] choice and it seems so insignificant but
[35:08] it's a devil in your
[35:11] decisions and sometimes you can do
[35:13] things and you think I ain't bother
[35:15] nobody ain't no big deal but it's the
[35:17] devil who you're
[35:20] choosing it's the enemy that's gotten a
[35:23] hold of your thoughts and the decisions
[35:25] you making are the thoughts of the the
[35:30] enemy right something to think about it
[35:33] and you know you you you had your curls
[35:36] going and and we going to talk about
[35:38] decision The Power of Choice and
[35:39] decision now you got your dress on you
[35:42] got your you got your you got your uh uh
[35:44] you got your curls going and and then
[35:47] you know you want to make sure every the
[35:49] decision the choice you made is good so
[35:51] you start posing
[36:01] see there's something behind that
[36:03] decision there's something behind the
[36:06] choice of your hair the choice of your
[36:10] clothing the choice of you coming to
[36:12] this
[36:17] banquet you know everything you do
[36:19] there's a purpose behind and sisters I'm
[36:22] not you know I love young sisters you
[36:24] know like brother Steve you know I got
[36:25] three women in my life you know and and
[36:29] and believe me I know what it means to
[36:31] to run to the
[36:33] bathroom before
[36:37] them cuz once they get in there they got
[36:39] a lot of choices to
[36:41] make a lot of
[36:43] choices and we on the outside saying you
[36:46] finished are you finished it's decision
[36:49] time are you
[36:51] finished but now it's sad to say that
[36:54] the that the young men are getting
[36:56] pretty they getting pretty they
[37:04] a't they spend more time in the bathroom
[37:07] than the
[37:09] women what's behind that choice you
[37:12] ain't going to come to church ain't no
[37:13] girl going to run their fingers through
[37:14] your
[37:17] hair we ain't in
[37:19] denomination right you miss around get
[37:22] kicked out the
[37:24] church I ain't talking about the pastor
[37:26] coming to you talking I'm talking about
[37:28] the deacons grabbing
[37:31] you that's how we came up Hallelujah but
[37:34] you know choices and decisions and and
[37:37] and everything you make I want
[37:39] everything you do I want you to realize
[37:41] that there is a spirit behind it you
[37:45] know and even for the brothers or
[37:48] whoever I believe it was cherith had the
[37:51] desire to have this banquet you know in
[37:54] her heart I believe she wanted y'all to
[37:56] be able to experience how much of a good
[37:59] time she had at her banquet amen amen
[38:03] and I I really believe she was sincere
[38:06] cuz me one time me CH you remember
[38:09] Texas me laugh about that cuz I'm going
[38:14] just leave it alone she know what I'm
[38:15] talking about but you know uh there
[38:18] there's some things you do and and it
[38:20] don't work out the way you think it
[38:22] ought to work out you know either the
[38:24] devil fights it or God makes it freely
[38:26] move
[38:28] and sometimes the devil fights it and
[38:29] then God makes it freely move but you
[38:32] have to make a
[38:33] de a choice when it comes to the things
[38:36] of God to stand
[38:38] firm don't give up don't quit but keep
[38:41] pressing on but I want to show you in
[38:44] the Bible I want I want you to
[38:46] understand that the Bible started with
[38:49] making choices yeah amen God came to
[38:52] Adam and Eve he came came you know Satan
[38:55] came to Eve and trying to get to make a
[38:57] CH choice you know either either what
[39:00] did God say and this is the Clincher
[39:03] most of you you know when you doing
[39:09] wrong it's a four-letter word I'm
[39:11] looking
[39:13] for let me help you y
[39:20] amen we don't have to take a text and
[39:23] wait for some special message to correct
[39:26] you most of us know when we doing
[39:29] wrong we know right from wrong we've
[39:31] reached the age of accountability ain't
[39:33] nobody ain't nobody got to turn you
[39:35] around and say is this spiritual or is
[39:37] that spiritual should I do this or
[39:39] shouldn't I do that you were built with
[39:40] that inside of you you know right from
[39:44] wrong you know you you you you know when
[39:47] you should be making a good choice
[39:48] versus a bad choice keep in mind I said
[39:51] you going to reap what you s yeah amen
[39:54] but you know from that place the devil
[39:57] he name and tried to take Eve off of
[40:00] God's word and make a
[40:03] choice when she had everything she
[40:05] needed she didn't have to use her own
[40:08] reasoning she didn't have to use her own
[40:10] thoughts all she had to do was stay with
[40:13] the word of God she didn't have to worry
[40:15] about man am I going to make the right
[40:17] decision or should I do this or should I
[40:19] do that all she had to do was stay with
[40:21] the word amen the word amen the word
[40:25] will give you the results of your
[40:28] actions so in that purest form she all
[40:31] she had to do was just well God said it
[40:34] and I'm I'm going stay with it I I ain't
[40:36] doing nothing that's my choice no matter
[40:39] what you're saying devil that's my
[40:40] choice God said this you don't have to
[40:43] explain it it'll do what God said it'll
[40:47] do that's the choice we got to make amen
[40:50] you don't have
[40:52] to uh figure this out figure that out
[40:55] figure this figure that figure that
[40:56] figure this
[40:58] [Music]
[41:01] why don't you try this I won't after
[41:03] this camp meeting or even after tonight
[41:06] uh uh uh you get in the next service you
[41:08] hear some things you you you you may not
[41:11] understand I want you to try this Lord I
[41:16] believe amen just try that just just try
[41:20] that just show God you're willing to
[41:22] accept this word and just say Lord I
[41:25] believe Lord I believe and I promise you
[41:28] if you take that attitude with the word
[41:30] of God God will clear it up to
[41:33] you but you know what Eve did it sounded
[41:36] good you know and probably over a
[41:38] process of time or whatever however long
[41:40] it took she got she was hearing that so
[41:45] much till it got common to
[41:48] her she was in that environment so much
[41:51] of somebody trying to take away from
[41:53] God's word stay out of that
[41:55] environment stay stay out of a worldly
[41:58] environment stay out of an environment
[41:59] where somebody is always challenging
[42:01] your
[42:02] faith if so-called friends is always
[42:05] trying to pull you from under the
[42:07] confidence of the word that ain't your
[42:10] friend you got somebody who's always in

[42:32] who's looking for a wife so he had a
[42:34] young lady he was talking with where he
[42:36] was trying to get to know her and he

[49:52] only one in the
[49:55] picture you and
[49:57] God you know when you look at Eve the
[50:00] the devil got her to make the wrong
[50:04] decision and that decision changed the
[50:06] course of the whole
[50:07] world yeah amen but you know God gave
[50:11] them the Power of Choice
[50:14] amen that that decision wouldn't Define
[50:17] the rest of their life am y'all realize
[50:22] that God told them unless they take a
[50:26] hold eternal life and live forever God
[50:29] gave them that opportunity yeah you
[50:31] messed up but I want you to grab hold of
[50:33] eternal life and live for God
[50:37] again so Church there's always an
[50:39] uplifting yeah there's always an
[50:42] uplifting you just got to find that
[50:44] place where you allow yourself to
[50:47] believe amen amen allow yourself to
[50:50] believe in God Amen Hallelujah and if we
[50:53] if we go in the scriptures from there
[50:55] you look at you look at uh
[50:58] Eve and what she went through then you
[50:59] get to Abraham Abraham had to make a
[51:02] choice amen amen God told him say hey
[51:06] I'm calling you you the father of nation
[51:08] you know you and Sarah going have going
[51:09] to have a child I'm sending you in a
[51:11] place that you know was Builders and
[51:13] makers of God you don't you don't know
[51:14] nothing about what I'm going to do but
[51:16] you got to
[51:18] go and he had to make a choice to say
[51:21] Lord I trust you amen Lord I trust you
[51:28] but it was hard for
[51:29] Abraham cuz Abraham wasn't used to
[51:32] letting go and depending on somebody
[51:35] else so he did what he thought was right
[51:39] you know he he brought his whole family
[51:41] with him oh I'm moving to Australia
[51:44] y'all come with
[51:47] me when God only called him God called
[51:51] him he wanted he wanted that security of
[51:54] his family with him that was the wrong
[51:56] choice yeah yeah because what that did
[51:59] that prolonged the purpose of God in his
[52:02] life because God had to get all the
[52:04] other stuff that he was connected to
[52:06] that wasn't a part of what God called
[52:08] him to amen and once God got all that
[52:12] God didn't really deal with him until
[52:14] lot them got out the
[52:16] picture and think about that you got
[52:18] somebody with you Hallelujah God didn't
[52:20] call you you got somebody with you but
[52:23] they Desiring something else right lot
[52:26] was Desiring something else go Abraham
[52:30] was Desiring God and human lot get into
[52:33] conflict and now H look at the wrong
[52:35] choice they're sitting out there and
[52:37] Abraham Abraham knew that he owned
[52:39] everything and so he tells lot he say
[52:42] well ain't no need for us to be arguing
[52:44] you go wherever you want to go and I go
[52:46] the opposite direction amen and lot
[52:48] looked out there he she said boy he saw
[52:52] solom amen he saw a little building down
[52:55] there you know maybe it's saw a taranaki
[52:59] sign or
[53:01] something and uh he said I think I'm
[53:03] going go down there everything look good
[53:05] they got a snow peak Mountain down there
[53:07] I I think I'm going go down there he
[53:09] says okay well Abraham say I'm going to
[53:11] go the other direction yeah so he went
[53:13] down there he thought the choice was all
[53:16] right but then at
[53:18] night Sodom and gamar lit
[53:21] up it was on fire firecracker party and
[53:25] everything
[53:29] they hear all the noise and all the
[53:31] music and
[53:32] every and lot sitting there
[53:38] looking

[53:51] again he's looking down at
[53:54] Sodom and you know what he does
[53:57] y'all know me I'm acting
[53:59] again you know what he does he goes to
[54:01] his wife he say hey Mama
[54:06] lot cuz you know the Bible don't say
[54:08] what her name was you know so we just
[54:11] call him Mama
[54:12] lot hey Mama lot we about out of
[54:15] firewood so I'm going go down to
[54:18] Sodom there something behind that
[54:22] decision yeah it's more than just wood
[54:25] he been the Bible says as he turned his
[54:28] eyes as he looked towards something see
[54:31] he looked toward that way and it start
[54:32] to affect him it start having a pull
[54:34] over his life and now he's at a place

[1:00:51] everybody you with
[1:00:53] me
[1:00:54] amen all right
[1:00:56] and you know Moses had to make a choice
[1:00:58] think about this let's start with his
[1:01:00] parents first a degree goes out kill all
[1:01:03] the boys kill kill all of them kill all
[1:01:05] the boys cuz I heard somebody coming up
[1:01:08] going to be a deliverer kill
[1:01:10] everybody and the mama looks had a baby
[1:01:12] like brother Steve
[1:01:15] said oh my precious
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:19] Moses and then she hear kill
[1:01:22] them I ain't killing my baby
[1:01:26] I'mma put him in the Nile I thought you
[1:01:28] w going to kill
[1:01:32] him but where was that decision coming
[1:01:35] from that wasn't her decision that was
[1:01:38] God moving on her Hallelujah and some
[1:01:42] things you may do you may seem like H
[1:01:45] should I should not but it's God
[1:01:47] directing things Hallelujah and you know
[1:01:50] Church she decided she she had to make a
[1:01:53] choice to give her child up and let them
[1:01:55] be killed or put her child in the river
[1:01:57] and trust God and she puts him in the
[1:02:00] river pictures the tent within and
[1:02:02] without with slime Hallelujah but she
[1:02:04] had to trust God she had to make a
[1:02:06] decision to trust God if this boy if
[1:02:08] there was something special about this
[1:02:11] boy but look God so rich in mercy God
[1:02:15] let Moses go down the Nile or or
[1:02:17] whatever it is the Congo River whatever
[1:02:19] whatever we want to call it they go he
[1:02:20] going down there he floating down there
[1:02:22] and God is protecting that sea
[1:02:24] Hallelujah then look at how God
[1:02:27] orchestrates things when you make a good
[1:02:29] choice Moses just goes down maybe it was
[1:02:32] a y'all know the kotto saac is maybe he
[1:02:35] just goes in a cc of water and he gets
[1:02:38] there and who's out there
[1:02:41] washing Pharaoh's
[1:02:43] daughter she had there wash and taking
[1:02:45] her bath got all her Maze and everything
[1:02:47] but what was significant about that God
[1:02:50] didn't just let Moses go to anybody he
[1:02:53] let Moses go to a woman who had a desire
[1:02:55] desire for a child
[1:02:58] amen hallelujah it was God allowing her
[1:03:02] to make that choice because God had
[1:03:04] every other piece of his life set up
[1:03:06] already amen and that's what happen to
[1:03:09] you when you get saved when you really
[1:03:11] get anchored and the Holy Ghost come God
[1:03:13] will begin to show you
[1:03:16] purpose Hallelujah but now Moses is
[1:03:19] growing he's in the Kingdom he growing
[1:03:22] in the Kingdom he getting the best of
[1:03:23] the best the finest of the finest the
[1:03:25] best teaching the best clothes you know

[1:03:29] grapes he could had whoever he wanted
[1:03:31] everything Mo life was good for Moses

[1:04:03] Pharaoh but his mama is telling him no

[1:04:10] knew what his mama was he looked at the
[1:04:11] window didn't see the mud doers
[1:04:14] yeah so he had to make a choice who he
[1:04:17] wanted to
[1:04:18] be hallah the popular choice wasn't one
[1:04:22] of them yeah the popular choice was I
[1:04:26] aroh this is my kingdom yeah that would
[1:04:29] have been a popular choice but that
[1:04:32] wasn't God's choice amen hallelujah and
[1:04:36] what happened to Moses when he made that
[1:04:38] decision Hallelujah his life changed

[1:06:19] about not all of you but some of you
[1:06:22] know what I'm talking
[1:06:24] about and you know
[1:06:27] sometimes God will allow us to go
[1:06:29] through things so we can turn back
[1:06:31] around and use it against the
[1:06:35] D so if you if if if you've had a bad
[1:06:38] experience don't mope and cry let God

[1:06:47] some worldly boy in church Hallelujah
[1:06:50] warn your other sisters about
[1:06:54] them now him personally but that
[1:06:57] Spirit H don't have a bashing group a we

[1:07:04] picture up there and throw darts at
[1:07:07] him girl
[1:07:12] power no I ain't talking about that I'm
[1:07:16] talking about praying and and and and
[1:07:18] encouraging each other and lifting each
[1:07:19] other up H if you've gone through
[1:07:22] something now you be see I always say
[1:07:24] things like this when somebody slip up
[1:07:27] and fall or they do something or or or
[1:07:29] or something really bad happens morally
[1:07:32] and everybody in church know about it
[1:07:34] that ain't a time to Outcast that
[1:07:37] person or or or put their names on a
[1:07:39] chopping block and talk about them from
