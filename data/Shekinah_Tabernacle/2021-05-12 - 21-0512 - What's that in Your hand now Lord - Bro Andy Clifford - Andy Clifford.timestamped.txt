[39:18] subject called what's that

[39:25] your hand now lord
[39:27] amen and there's a question mark at the
[39:28] end of that because we want to know what
[39:30] is in the lord's hand
[39:32] can i please have a bible i just want a
[39:34] nice paper bible not someone else's

[39:37] have you got a spare one now you can use
[39:39] that i just love to have it's like my
[39:41] you know
[39:43] i just love having a book because you
[39:45] know
[39:46] you can't hold this up as a
[39:47] demonstration for a bible because it's
[39:49] just
[39:50] an electronic device so i like that
[39:54] so amen let's turn in our bibles while
[39:57] we're standing to
[39:59] revelation chapter 10 and we'll read
[40:01] verses one and two
[40:04] oh my and then we're going to turn to
[40:05] exodus 4
[40:07] and we'll read verses 1 to 4.
[40:12] it says here
[40:17] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[40:19] from heaven clothed with a cloud
[40:22] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[40:24] face was as it were the sun
[40:27] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[40:30] had in his hand a little book
[40:33] open and he said
[40:36] his right foot on the sea and his left
[40:38] foot on the earth
[40:40] and let's go to exodus 4
[40:44] verses 1 to 4.
[40:51] and moses answered and said but
[40:55] behold they will not believe me
[40:58] no now see god was now you know
[41:00] commissioning moses at the burning bush
[41:02] and
[41:02] moses was making up he didn't want to do
[41:04] it you know he was making up every
[41:06] reason not to do it so
[41:07] and god was now unfolding and undoing
[41:10] all of his reasons
[41:12] and so moses now he's now towards the
[41:15] end of this dialogue
[41:16] and and moses says and moses answered
[41:20] and said
[41:21] but behold they the israelites that he's
[41:24] sent to will not believe me nor hearken
[41:27] unto my voice for they will say
[41:29] the lord has not appeared unto thee
[41:32] and the lord said unto him what is that
[41:35] in my hand
[41:38] and moses said a rod and he said cast it
[41:42] on the ground and he
[41:43] shall cast it and he cast it on the
[41:45] ground and it became a serpent and moses
[41:48] fled from it
[41:49] from before it and the lord said unto
[41:51] moses
[41:52] put forth thine hand and take it by the
[41:55] tail
[41:56] and he put forth his hand and caught it
[41:57] and it became a rod
[41:59] in his hands god bless you you may be
[42:02] seated
[42:06] and may god bless the reading of his
[42:07] word
[42:10] the prophet says listen from that time
[42:16] but my ministry is a different ministry
[42:17] from a pastor or a teacher
[42:21] i'm i'm not he says and if i say things
[42:24] wrong brethren forgive me i don't mean
[42:25] it
[42:26] but this is my ministry see to declare
[42:28] him
[42:29] that he is here so you see there was
[42:32] something
[42:33] greater happening that i want to talk
[42:35] about
[42:36] tonight and i want this question for you
[42:38] to ask this question personally to the
[42:40] lord
[42:41] what is that in your hand now lord
[42:44] because you see
[42:45] there has always been
[42:48] a a war in the mind of man
[42:52] to understand and to see what god is
[42:56] doing
[42:56] now what god is presently doing because
[43:00] anyone can be a historian and see how it
[43:02] unfolded and see the results and see the
[43:04] fruit
[43:05] and then everyone just believes that
[43:06] because they saw it worked and everyone
[43:08] can
[43:08] read prophecy and go wow look at this
[43:10] this is what's going to happen and half
[43:12] the time they're not right because they
[43:14] are twisted in their own filters and
[43:15] things but it's
[43:17] that doesn't save you the history
[43:20] doesn't save you
[43:21] right you need to understand what
[43:25] who where he is what is jesus doing
[43:28] what is that in your hand lord what are
[43:31] you doing right now lord
[43:33] what is your program what is your
[43:34] purpose what is your plan for this age
[43:36] what are you doing in this generation
[43:39] i understand lord you've done great
[43:41] things throughout history right from
[43:43] adam all the way before adam
[43:45] that we know all the glorious things but
[43:47] lord what are you doing now
[43:49] because i want to know the person that
[43:51] did all that
[43:53] you understand it makes a big difference
[43:55] because anyone can be a historian but do
[43:57] they know him
[44:00] are they holding his hand as ed was
[44:02] saying are they hearing his heartbeat
[44:04] because you see he is the word and so if
[44:07] you're near him if you're
[44:08] in fellowship with him if you understand
[44:10] if you know what he's doing
[44:11] if you're in the program of god you are
[44:13] going to hear his heartbeat
[44:15] that's what hearing his heartbeat is all
[44:16] about you're coming into rhythm you know
[44:18] when you when the when the great
[44:20] composer
[44:21] he beats out the symphony you know and
[44:23] he writes the music and it's beautiful
[44:25] and it's got all the drama and all the
[44:27] suspense and the resolutions and
[44:28] everything in there
[44:30] you know the two two but there's if
[44:33] you're in the concert
[44:34] you know and and here's the start and
[44:36] hit this four parts to a concerto
[44:39] so where is it you know
[44:43] if you're playing in that thing if
[44:45] you're trained
[44:46] you you can't just come in where you
[44:48] where you want to come in
[44:50] you're going to come in where the beat
[44:51] is beating this makes a huge difference
[44:54] and so i want to talk
[44:55] tonight about this about
[44:59] understanding and coming into connection
[45:01] with
[45:02] the very rhythm and the beat of the
[45:05] heart of god
[45:07] amen to come and hold the hands of the
[45:09] one that died for me on calvary
[45:11] to hold his hand to know him to walk
[45:14] with him
[45:15] to walk with the one that went into the
[45:16] fiery furnace with all of those boys
[45:18] in babylon that's the one i want to hold
[45:20] his hand who wants to hold his hand
[45:22] tonight
[45:23] who wants to be in fellowship with the
[45:24] living god as
[45:26] men brother and paul we were having some
[45:27] fellowship one night and we were calling
[45:29] him
[45:30] the now god he's not the before or after
[45:32] god he's the now god
[45:34] and if you don't have the now about you
[45:35] haven't got any god
[45:37] right true you've got to be in
[45:40] fellowship with the now god and that's
[45:42] what calvary is all about
[45:44] that's what the redemption redemption's
[45:45] all about hallelujah
[45:47] but i want to take it now and make it
[45:50] very personal
[45:51] and bring a clarification on what
[45:54] happened
[45:55] in revelation chapter 10 and what the
[45:57] difference
[45:58] is what is he holding in his hand that
[46:00] he hasn't held in his hand before
[46:02] since adam lost the redemption in the
[46:05] garden
[46:06] because god's visited the earth many
[46:08] times many times as god visited the
[46:11] earth and done many things and
[46:12] come into the affairs of his children as
[46:14] sons as daughters
[46:15] and done great redemption acts and and
[46:18] great types have been unfolded and
[46:20] prophecies all throughout the ages
[46:22] throughout the church ages he's done
[46:23] great things many things
[46:25] laying a foundation telling a story
[46:27] doing great things
[46:28] and redeeming and saving and sealing as
[46:30] people
[46:31] but in the end time everything
[46:35] changes everything changes
[46:40] and it's all to do with what he's
[46:41] holding in his hand
[46:43] at the end time and it's the very
[46:47] paperwork spiritual paperwork
[46:50] that adam lost in the garden the very
[46:54] title deed
[46:55] if anyone's bought any land you will
[46:57] understand that you need to
[46:58] hold the title you need to hold the
[47:01] paperwork that says
[47:02] you own that land and and before you buy
[47:04] it you're going to get a lawyer to
[47:06] search it all the way back to make sure
[47:08] that there's no other things that are
[47:09] attached to it
[47:11] amen
[47:14] and then you buy the land right now
[47:16] there's a land that's been purchased by
[47:18] our loving lord jesus
[47:19] that no human could purchase no human
[47:21] could buy
[47:22] and he purchased that land and you are
[47:25] part of it
[47:28] you're part of that land
[47:32] hallelujah in all the ages
[47:35] the book of our inheritance you see he
[47:37] had an open book in his hand we read
[47:38] that right
[47:39] you caught that what is that now in your
[47:41] hand lord
[47:42] what have you got in your hand lord that
[47:44] you didn't have in any other church age
[47:45] or any other denomination or any other
[47:47] time
[47:48] any time what is that lord that you've
[47:50] got in your hand
[47:51] and where did you get that from lord
[47:53] where did it come from why wasn't it in
[47:55] your hand already and why did the other
[47:56] churches not have it
[47:58] who wants to understand that tonight who
[48:00] wants to see it so clearly so simply
[48:03] to resolve all the doubts and all the
[48:04] fears and all the you know the devil
[48:06] likes to mystify things you know and
[48:08] make it all
[48:09] but we want to just we want to see it
[48:10] and make it ours
[48:12] tonight it's mine it's yours
[48:15] but you see for all these ages and we'll
[48:18] read soon
[48:19] it said that man was not worthy to even
[48:21] look on it
[48:22] let alone open it and read it even look
[48:25] at it
[48:26] hallelujah but we have a champion
[48:30] oh we have a lamb amen we have a lamb
[48:33] that was worthy
[48:34] oh i feel like just going right into it
[48:36] already but we'll be very disciplined
[48:39] amen you know me everyone knows me very
[48:41] well
[48:42] i'm being very good right now
[48:45] oh lord jesus it was not real oh here
[48:50] sorry i'm just reading my own notes so
[48:53] excuse me this is not
[48:54] a scripture or quote or anything i'm
[48:55] just reading this just to keep the
[48:57] vision you know
[48:58] in the ages the book of our inheritance
[49:00] that adam lost
[49:02] was sealed in the hands of the original
[49:04] owner
[49:06] adam lost it that book said adam you own
[49:09] the earth you've got all
[49:11] power over everything over the fish over
[49:13] the trees you've got dominion you say it
[49:15] will happen you've you're god over the
[49:16] earth adam you're my son
[49:18] and i give you full dominion you do
[49:19] whatever you want adam you make this
[49:21] earth how you like it
[49:23] and adam lost it he lost it and he lost
[49:26] his connection to god he lost
[49:28] his connection to that divine fellowship
[49:30] you could say all of the glory of heaven
[49:33] left him he was disconnected but he had
[49:36] a memory
[49:37] he remembered it he must have told his
[49:39] sons and he would have understood great
[49:41] things and mysteries and
[49:42] but it was all just mysteries and great
[49:44] things and unfortunately sometimes
[49:46] that's all it is in our own life
[49:47] it's just mysteries and great things but
[49:49] what about the one that adam lost
[49:52] the connection that's been forged again
[49:55] that's been connected again and you can
[49:57] have that
[49:58] hallelujah amen
[50:06] it was not released until the correct
[50:09] season for it
[50:10] this is that redemption book now it was
[50:12] not released
[50:13] until the correct season for it because
[50:16] of the power that it contains
[50:18] you know this book contains everything
[50:23] and it basically gives you full legal
[50:24] right to everything that adam lost
[50:27] hallelujah oh my you know we're going to
[50:30] speak things into existence
[50:32] you know we're going to travel by
[50:33] thought you know we're just going to say
[50:35] to that mountain be moved
[50:36] you know you read these things in the
[50:38] gospels right and i've read them for
[50:39] years and i've gone
[50:40] wow you know this is amazing and you
[50:42] know it's and you think
[50:44] you go out there you know everyone's
[50:45] probably done it and go outside and you
[50:47] stay to the mountain now move and it
[50:50] doesn't move right why is it not moving
[50:51] lord
[50:52] everyone has those moments right
[50:54] especially the children my children they
[50:55] were
[50:56] becca told me the other day you know she
[50:58] said she always says to the sea oh no
[51:00] she walks up to the sea and she goes to
[51:01] walk on the water you know
[51:02] she wants to walk on the water i said
[51:04] you will one day you'll just walk on
[51:06] that water
[51:07] it'll just happen you know and and and
[51:10] we won't get too far into that today it
[51:12] will go beyond our scope but
[51:14] this is this is our reality these are
[51:17] the things that we're going to inherit
[51:19] and then and if you've got the holy
[51:20] ghost let me just drop this if you have
[51:22] the holy ghost now you've got that
[51:24] it's already in you hallelujah
[51:27] what's that you're holding in your hand
[51:29] now lord hallelujah
[51:32] because you see it's very important that
[51:33] you understand
[51:35] what he's coming with you know i'm sure
[51:38] that they understood what he's coming
[51:39] with every time he came because he bring
[51:41] it
[51:42] but the devil will try everything he can
[51:43] to block the elect in every age and
[51:45] every time god would move
[51:46] do a revival you know god would bring
[51:48] something god brings something to the
[51:51] table
[51:52] you know he brings grace he brings mercy
[51:54] he brings an element of grace or an
[51:56] escape
[51:57] you know in every age there's always
[51:58] something he's done and he's doing for
[52:00] the people
[52:01] to rescue them to change them to tell a
[52:03] story to reveal his glory to
[52:05] to to declare something to build an
[52:08] image to
[52:09] to do whatever he's doing there's always
[52:11] something he brings to the table
[52:16] however so it says here it was not
[52:19] released
[52:20] the book of redemption was not released
[52:22] until the correct season for it
[52:24] however the other ages received the same
[52:27] holy spirit
[52:29] so this is where now we can start to
[52:31] understand
[52:32] that they had the holy ghost god's come
[52:35] down in every church age
[52:37] done the same things the power of god
[52:39] the miracles if they could believe
[52:41] because he's still the same he doesn't
[52:42] change right jesus christ the same
[52:45] yesterday today and forever
[52:49] all right that doesn't mean that jesus
[52:51] christ gives the same message to every
[52:53] age
[52:54] it just means that he's the same he can
[52:56] choose what he gives he can choose how
[52:58] much grace he's dispensing
[53:00] to the people and he will program it and
[53:02] plan it
[53:04] so that the final age goes into rapture
[53:10] so that you and i who believes we're in
[53:13] the final age
[53:14] i don't even i believe we're just like
[53:16] beyond the final age you know we're just
[53:18] about to go
[53:19] we're nearly there so
[53:23] but he didn't he can't do that for the
[53:25] every other age
[53:27] because if they took that they would
[53:28] have gone into raps already
[53:30] and it would have broken the program so
[53:32] he did other things
[53:33] but it was the same god with the same
[53:34] holy spirit and the same anointing and
[53:36] the same
[53:37] everything and his personality as grace
[53:40] and all of those things
[53:41] but he wasn't holding an open book in
[53:43] his hand
[53:45] at that stage because it wasn't open
[53:49] you know we read in the book of daniel
[53:50] in daniel 9 it says daniel do you know
[53:52] daniel the prophet right
[53:53] he was a prophet that was breaking into
[53:56] the mysteries and
[53:57] breaking into what would happen in the
[53:58] end time and you know as a prophet and
[54:00] that gift
[54:01] he was just pushing you know fasting for
[54:04] weeks
[54:05] and god would honor that and he would
[54:06] begin to show but then it got to a point
[54:08] where he said
[54:09] daniel no more i can't do this yet
[54:12] because
[54:13] it's going to be sealed until the time
[54:15] of the end and at that time he described
[54:17] the conditions of the world he said many
[54:19] shall run to and fro
[54:20] airplanes all over the world and
[54:22] knowledge shall be increased
[54:24] knowledge increased in only last century
[54:28] for thousands of years they had horse
[54:30] and cart and swords
[54:31] i mean there was a little bit of a
[54:32] technological advancement but nothing
[54:35] like it was after the wars
[54:38] nothing ever like that it went from
[54:40] horse and cart in 1850
[54:42] to an astronaut on the moon in 1960
[54:46] how does that happen 69 or wherever it
[54:48] was 69 right
[54:50] was it 69 so there was like this
[54:53] cataclysmic change
[54:54] something happened something was
[54:56] released some anointing some
[54:58] wisdom of the tree of knowledge was just
[55:00] released on the earth
[55:02] and it just opened up all of the
[55:03] dimensions
[55:05] you know revelation 9 everyone knows
[55:07] revelation 9 how it said that
[55:09] um this that a a fallen star star would
[55:12] fall from heaven and
[55:13] have a key to the bottomless pit and
[55:14] open it up and black smoke would come
[55:16] out on the earth
[55:17] right and all the things that went on
[55:19] from there and the wars that said a
[55:21] third party man was killed which
[55:22] describes
[55:23] world war one and two right all of these
[55:26] things happened revelation 9
[55:28] bringing out hell on the earth through
[55:30] all this technology and
[55:31] you know it's here now and hell's on the
[55:34] earth but
[55:36] heaven's also on the earth hallelujah
[55:38] and he's represented in you
[55:40] so the war of it's like a cold war you
[55:43] know
[55:44] it's a cold war and you'd seen you
[55:46] you're the meat in the sandwich
[55:48] your mind and god has come down and the
[55:51] devil
[55:52] has come up and it's just this great war
[55:54] that's going on
[55:56] and hardly anyone knows about it they
[55:59] think they're just living this life
[56:00] and really they're just living in
[56:02] blindness and sin
[56:04] and looking at the devil's facade and
[56:06] his visage and everything that he's
[56:08] showing people
[56:09] christians as well message believers too
[56:11] looking at this
[56:12] and not seeing through it but there is a
[56:14] veneer
[56:16] oh my and the lord has called us he says
[56:18] come to me
[56:19] my children and take of me i self
[56:22] so that you can see so tonight if you
[56:25] need i self
[56:26] just ask them young people you teenagers
[56:30] wherever you may be in your walk say
[56:32] lord
[56:33] give me yourself because i don't want to
[56:36] be blinded by the devil
[56:38] oh my all of us not just young people
[56:42] everyone
[56:45] hallelujah
[56:53] so i just want to emphasize that the
[56:56] same holy spirit
[56:58] but yet in this age that same holy
[57:00] spirit
[57:01] comes with a full message he comes with
[57:04] everything
[57:05] he comes with an open book you see in
[57:07] every other age it was closed
[57:09] and every other age it was sealed with
[57:10] seven seals in every other age you know
[57:12] he didn't
[57:13] see our lord came
[57:16] and he purchased that let's read
[57:26] and no man in heaven nor on earth
[57:28] revelation chapter 5
[57:30] verses 3 to 7 it says and no man in
[57:32] heaven nor on earth
[57:33] neither under the earth was able to open
[57:35] the book neither to look there on
[57:37] and i wept much because no man was found
[57:39] worthy to open
[57:41] and to read the book neither to look
[57:43] thereon
[57:44] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[57:46] not
[57:47] who's so glad that he said weep not amen
[57:50] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[57:53] the root of david
[57:54] has prevailed to open the book and to
[57:56] loose the seven seals
[57:58] thereof now listen listen to his what
[58:01] did he see
[58:03] and i beheld in low in the midst of the
[58:05] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[58:06] midst of the elders
[58:08] so in the middle of all the people
[58:10] representing all the ages
[58:12] all the elders all the the the people of
[58:14] all time that had ever come to
[58:16] to lead and with him it says here
[58:21] a lamb as it had been slain
[58:25] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[58:27] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[58:29] into all the earth
[58:30] and he came oh my i like that i just
[58:33] want to emphasize he
[58:35] he came and took the book out of the
[58:38] right hand of him
[58:39] that sat upon the throne this is the one
[58:41] that came and took the book right
[58:43] so all these other ages seven spirits
[58:45] seven eyes so the seven messengers to
[58:47] the seven church ages right
[58:48] they were given a message they were
[58:50] given a portion you know see they gave
[58:52] jo
[58:52] he gave paul the full portion except he
[58:55] didn't give him the open book because
[58:57] they would have gone in a rapture
[58:58] but he was sowing the seed in paul's age
[59:00] he was sowing the seed so that the seed
[59:02] could
[59:03] be given to the church and buried into
[59:05] the church in the dark ages but then
[59:07] come back up again
[59:08] as we know the cycle of death burial and
[59:10] resurrection it says that
[59:12] this is the same thing that happened in
[59:14] the church the same thing when the seed
[59:16] came into the church the lord brought it
[59:18] it went through the church and they
[59:19] rejoiced but they aimed
[59:21] at in that first church age under paul's
[59:24] message they
[59:24] aimed at this rapture this tree of life
[59:28] this and what adam lost they aimed at it
[59:31] but relaxed
[59:33] that's what this ate that age that first
[59:35] church age men
[59:36] so you see when the lord came to them he
[59:39] hadn't taken that book
[59:41] because there was still six more ages to
[59:44] go afterwards
[59:45] and so he came to the second age
[59:46] irenaeus and the third age and martin
[59:48] the fourth age and
[59:49] uh columba and martin luther in the
[59:52] fifth and
[59:53] john wesley in the seventh and william
[59:55] branham sorry six and william branham in
[59:57] the seventh
[59:58] but who's here now who's here now
[1:00:02] who got who got introduced
[1:00:06] the one that says the one that came
[1:00:09] the one that says and he came he's the
[1:00:12] one that's here now
[1:00:13] he was introduced right and i read that
[1:00:16] before the prophet says my ministry is
[1:00:17] not all this great teaching and all
[1:00:19] these things it's to declare him
[1:00:21] that he's here and then he says as john
[1:00:23] the baptist
[1:00:24] you know he says john the baptist had to
[1:00:26] pull back now
[1:00:28] he pulled back left the scene and left
[1:00:31] who here
[1:00:32] oh my who's here then and you can say
[1:00:36] what's that in your hand now lord what
[1:00:39] what are you carrying for me
[1:00:41] because you see in seven other ages
[1:00:42] there was power there was glory there
[1:00:44] was grace
[1:00:45] there was the supernatural whatever god
[1:00:47] was doing there was a provision for all
[1:00:49] of them in every age and
[1:00:51] every revival that god did but then it
[1:00:54] came to the time of the end where he
[1:00:56] himself our man our human oh my
[1:01:00] you see adam lost it adam the first adam
[1:01:03] he lost this inheritance and all through
[1:01:06] the last 6 000
[1:01:08] years man didn't have it
[1:01:11] man didn't display what adam lost there
[1:01:13] was little portions of it moses had a
[1:01:15] portion
[1:01:15] he could speak and god gave him this
[1:01:17] anointing and and he was able to create
[1:01:19] things and all of that but
[1:01:20] and there was little portions revealed
[1:01:22] god was building something
[1:01:24] he was building a vision he was building
[1:01:26] the image of himself
[1:01:27] and he was revealing it in little
[1:01:28] portions of prophets and different men
[1:01:31] and women
[1:01:32] showing a story because our god is a
[1:01:34] storytelling god
[1:01:36] he's and you can read every story in the
[1:01:38] old testament and find yourself in there
[1:01:41] and if you can't i encourage you to read
[1:01:43] it again
[1:01:44] if you can't see jesus christ and
[1:01:46] yourself and every story of scripture
[1:01:49] somewhere then go read it again because
[1:01:52] he will show you
[1:01:54] and he's done that and you see now so
[1:01:56] he's done this through every age
[1:01:58] and he's built this image and he's
[1:02:00] building something
[1:02:02] hallelujah but in all these ages and all
[1:02:05] these visitations and everything that
[1:02:06] he's done through all these people
[1:02:09] man could not display what adam lost
[1:02:13] but then two thousand years ago
[1:02:15] hallelujah
[1:02:16] god rich in mercy amen who believes he's
[1:02:20] rich in mercy tonight
[1:02:21] god rich in mercy said you know
[1:02:25] the first adam failed the first adam
[1:02:27] left
[1:02:28] the first adam lost his inheritance and
[1:02:30] it's been back in the hands of the
[1:02:31] invisible god
[1:02:33] but there has to be a human because
[1:02:35] humans need it back
[1:02:37] hallelujah are you with me
[1:02:40] shoot the mankind the race of mankind
[1:02:43] needs this redemption back
[1:02:45] but how can an angel redeem it
[1:02:48] no can the trees redeem it can can
[1:02:51] can you know so what what happens what
[1:02:54] what could happen
[1:02:55] only one only god
[1:02:58] only god so god he made himself a body
[1:03:01] to live in
[1:03:03] a finite body a mortal body made a
[1:03:06] little lower than the angels it says
[1:03:08] and he made himself an egg and a sperm
[1:03:10] in the womb of a virgin
[1:03:12] hallelujah he sent her a gabriel
[1:03:16] the angel and he declared to her that
[1:03:17] you shall be the
[1:03:19] mother you you know in your womb is
[1:03:22] going to be born
[1:03:23] the child the christ and shall call his
[1:03:26] name
[1:03:27] jesus for he shall save his people from
[1:03:29] their sins
[1:03:30] you see now so here you have now the
[1:03:33] second race of man
[1:03:35] here you have now this race that was not
[1:03:38] connected by genealogy to the curse
[1:03:41] because you see all the sins and all the
[1:03:43] evils and everything that went on all
[1:03:45] the way back to adam
[1:03:46] was all full of curses and that's why
[1:03:49] when you're born you just struggle
[1:03:51] it's easy to lie it's easy to swear if
[1:03:53] you get caught in it
[1:03:54] it's easy to do evil things because the
[1:03:56] flesh is born with
[1:03:58] it but he wasn't you see he was our
[1:04:00] redeemer
[1:04:02] this was our man and he lived a perfect
[1:04:04] life
[1:04:05] and he lived right through his whole
[1:04:07] ministry and through his life he lived
[1:04:08] perfect
[1:04:09] and he displayed everything that adam
[1:04:12] lost
[1:04:12] he spoke to the trees and they obeyed
[1:04:14] him he spoke to the waves and they
[1:04:16] obeyed him when it was storm he could
[1:04:18] walk on the storm
[1:04:19] so don't think that when you're in a
[1:04:20] storm and when you're in a dark place
[1:04:22] and when it's too much that he can't
[1:04:24] walk on to see you
[1:04:26] he can come to you where you're at
[1:04:28] tonight he can come to you
[1:04:30] no matter how stormy i was showing my
[1:04:31] children a stormy sea and it's not
[1:04:33] you know the cartoons just show this and
[1:04:36] it's just on this little wave you know i
[1:04:37] was thinking now
[1:04:38] no no the bible says it was great
[1:04:40] tempestuous boisterous waves
[1:04:42] hundred foot waves but he can do hundred
[1:04:44] foot waves
[1:04:45] hallelujah because if you've got mastery
[1:04:47] of the elements
[1:04:48] your master not doesn't matter what how
[1:04:50] big how hard how small
[1:04:52] no matter what you're struggling with
[1:04:54] hallelujah
[1:04:55] he came walking on the water because he
[1:04:57] was our second adam
[1:04:59] he was our redeemer he's the one that
[1:05:00] had the purchasing power in his blood
[1:05:03] he's the one that could pay the price he
[1:05:05] was the one
[1:05:06] hallelujah that displayed everything
[1:05:09] that adam lost
[1:05:10] he had control of nature he kept
[1:05:12] controlled all these things and he did
[1:05:13] it because
[1:05:14] he was displaying everything that he was
[1:05:17] going to redeem back
[1:05:20] he was going to redeem it all back and
[1:05:22] so
[1:05:23] on calvary when he died hallelujah
[1:05:26] when he gave his life on calvary you
[1:05:28] know when and
[1:05:30] and he he bled and he purchased our
[1:05:32] redemption
[1:05:33] hanging there bleeding with the thorns
[1:05:35] around his brow and and completely
[1:05:38] utterly rejected by his own people
[1:05:42] completely dejected
[1:05:45] he purchased our salvation completely
[1:05:48] and utterly
[1:05:50] taking our sins upon himself
[1:05:54] to purchase our salvation to make the
[1:05:56] purchase but you see
[1:05:58] the purchase is part of the redemption
[1:06:00] to finish the purchase
[1:06:02] now let me read
[1:06:10] ephesians 1 9 to 14 it says here
[1:06:13] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:06:15] his will
[1:06:16] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:06:18] has purposed in himself
[1:06:20] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:06:24] of times
[1:06:25] he might gather together in one all
[1:06:28] things in christ
[1:06:30] so you see in the dispensation so when
[1:06:32] the fullness of times is dispensed
[1:06:35] he's going to gather all things to
[1:06:37] himself so
[1:06:38] everything that he purchased on calvary
[1:06:41] you know there's at least
[1:06:42] paul here is talking about a future
[1:06:44] event he's talking about somewhere in
[1:06:47] the future
[1:06:47] there's going to be a gathering there's
[1:06:50] going to be a unifying there's going to
[1:06:52] be a uniting time there's going to be a
[1:06:54] rapture
[1:06:54] there's going to be where he gathers and
[1:06:57] collects
[1:06:58] everything he purchased and let me tell
[1:07:01] you right now we're in the middle of
[1:07:02] that
[1:07:03] we're in the middle of him gathering
[1:07:05] everything that he purchased
[1:07:07] and this is what the devil will fight so
[1:07:09] that you don't understand it so when
[1:07:10] someone tells you
[1:07:12] that he's come to gather everything to
[1:07:14] himself
[1:07:15] then you know people the devil will tell
[1:07:17] people it's still in the future
[1:07:19] and if he's if you believe that then it
[1:07:22] will always be in the future for you
[1:07:25] but if you want it in the present for
[1:07:26] you if you want it now
[1:07:28] if you want to have that now believe
[1:07:30] it's yours
[1:07:32] believe what he's doing say lord open my
[1:07:34] eyes to see
[1:07:36] your work of redemption to see that
[1:07:38] you're gathering me
[1:07:39] to see that when you step forth as a
[1:07:41] bloody lamb and you took that book
[1:07:44] out of the hands of the original owner
[1:07:46] you were claiming back everything
[1:07:49] that adam lost you were bringing back
[1:07:52] the title deed of redemption and
[1:07:54] everything that he lost
[1:07:56] and you were possessing that back in
[1:07:57] human hands that's our human that's our
[1:08:00] god man that's our jesus
[1:08:02] this is what jesus did he came to
[1:08:05] purchase us back
[1:08:06] so when he took that book when he took
[1:08:08] that title deed he was taking
[1:08:10] ownership of everything that was his
[1:08:14] now in the process of that when that
[1:08:16] book had sat there for
[1:08:18] 6 000 years because remember this has
[1:08:20] only happened in the last
[1:08:22] 60 years right 60 years ago this
[1:08:24] happened
[1:08:25] you know we think the world just goes on
[1:08:27] right even the messages the people that
[1:08:29] believe this
[1:08:30] just will go on but is it significant to
[1:08:33] you
[1:08:35] are you moved by this or are you wanting
[1:08:37] to go to sleep
[1:08:38] who wants to go to sleep you know what
[1:08:41] does this mean to you
[1:08:43] this should be everything what i'm
[1:08:46] telling you now
[1:08:47] if you're not born again you can be born
[1:08:49] again by hearing this
[1:08:51] you can receive the new birth by hearing
[1:08:53] what you're hearing tonight
[1:08:54] you can humble your pride you can take
[1:08:57] your whole message religious spirit off
[1:08:58] you
[1:08:59] and receive the holy ghost and it will
[1:09:01] change your life
[1:09:02] tonight because the new birth
[1:09:05] is when jesus is revealed to you all
[1:09:08] right
[1:09:09] jesus comes in the form of a mighty
[1:09:12] angel
[1:09:12] with an open book right when we read
[1:09:14] revelation chapter 10
[1:09:17] and you've got this mighty angel with
[1:09:19] the covenant about his head
[1:09:22] you know that that's the holy ghost
[1:09:23] right it's the holy spirit
[1:09:25] right the lord can appear in an angelic
[1:09:28] form it's the holy ghost
[1:09:29] it's that holy ghost right because in
[1:09:32] revelation
[1:09:33] 5 it was closed and it was in the hands
[1:09:35] of the original owner
[1:09:37] and in those 6 000 years that it was
[1:09:39] closed guess who
[1:09:40] squatted on the earth guessed who
[1:09:44] started destroying human lives guess who
[1:09:47] put idols in many civilizations
[1:09:50] well that title deed that said man you
[1:09:52] own everything you're over it all you're
[1:09:54] the god of the earth you're my son
[1:09:56] you're my daughter who when that was out
[1:09:59] of man's hands he couldn't get it back
[1:10:01] he wasn't even worthy to look at it
[1:10:04] who came in and pretended they owned it
[1:10:09] the devil why do you think your family's
[1:10:12] struggling right now
[1:10:13] why do you think there's all these
[1:10:14] things going on in your home why do you
[1:10:15] think your children just want to run
[1:10:17] away sometimes
[1:10:18] they struggle and it's all the mind
[1:10:19] battles it's because of a squatter
[1:10:22] it's because of someone who doesn't own
[1:10:24] what they're lying to you about
[1:10:26] lying he's lying he's a liar right
[1:10:30] now whatever you're going through he's a
[1:10:31] liar he's a liar he's a squatter
[1:10:34] and the reason he's there is because
[1:10:36] that book was in the hands
[1:10:38] of the original owner for six thousand
[1:10:40] years but let me declare something to
[1:10:41] you
[1:10:42] we have a champion we have a human a
[1:10:44] real human a real man
[1:10:46] our jesus he took it back and he didn't
[1:10:49] just keep it for himself
[1:10:50] he's come down to the earth to you
[1:10:52] tonight to say i want to live in you
[1:10:54] i want to open it to you and i want to
[1:10:56] make it personal to you
[1:10:58] so that when you stand you can have this
[1:11:00] in your hand
[1:11:01] who wants this in their hand this was
[1:11:04] the end
[1:11:06] of my sermon but i said what's in your
[1:11:08] hand now
[1:11:09] what's in your hand tonight what is it
[1:11:12] hallelujah if he's in you that's in you
[1:11:16] and if he's in you holding that then you
[1:11:19] can hold it too because
[1:11:20] he's in you right hallelujah
[1:11:23] come on church come on
[1:11:26] this is not an age to sit back and relax
[1:11:28] and enjoy your christianity
[1:11:30] oh my no no no no don't this is not a
[1:11:33] christian enjoyment time
[1:11:35] this is a fighting time hallelujah
[1:11:38] uniting time is fighting time you've got
[1:11:41] to stand for your rights you've got to
[1:11:43] stand for what's yours
[1:11:44] you've got to claim it back because he
[1:11:46] is a squatter the devil's a squatter
[1:11:48] who knows what a squatter is a squatter
[1:11:51] or somebody that comes into land that
[1:11:53] doesn't own it
[1:11:54] and there's it happens all over the
[1:11:55] world and there's even laws that protect
[1:11:57] them
[1:11:58] oh my that's just the devil right and
[1:12:01] the devil does that
[1:12:02] because adam lost it and if adam lost it
[1:12:05] he couldn't possess what he owned
[1:12:07] meant to own he lost it right he
[1:12:09] couldn't possess it so it was just in
[1:12:11] wasteland
[1:12:12] the earth was just in wasteland you
[1:12:14] could say one man at that time
[1:12:16] and one woman who was meant to rule the
[1:12:18] earth
[1:12:20] had dominion and everything be in
[1:12:21] perfect harmony
[1:12:23] oh my hallelujah
[1:12:27] everything just in perfection and
[1:12:29] everything just so glorious because
[1:12:30] the son of god was living in the earth
[1:12:33] and he was ruling over it but when he
[1:12:34] lost it
[1:12:36] he lost it he lost governance
[1:12:39] he lost the power of of attorney he lost
[1:12:42] everything apart from his physical life
[1:12:45] which he would lose eventually
[1:12:47] as the lord promised but while that
[1:12:50] happened
[1:12:51] an an invader came in an invader came in
[1:12:54] to invade
[1:12:55] to come and to destroy to come into
[1:12:57] squat thinking because he's not a
[1:12:59] gentleman
[1:13:00] he doesn't care whether he owns it or
[1:13:01] not he's just going to claim it

[1:14:04] then in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:14:06] of times that he might gather together
[1:14:09] in one all things in
[1:14:12] christ all those that were named in
[1:14:15] islam's book of life
[1:14:16] and in the book of life both first
[1:14:19] resurrection and second resurrection
[1:14:20] believers
[1:14:21] both sheep and ghosts not goats sorry
[1:14:24] both sheep
[1:14:24] and the first resurrection that takes
[1:14:26] part in the marriage supper
[1:14:28] the first fruits of his oh you know the
[1:14:30] foolish virgin and the wise virgin
[1:14:31] all of them from israel all the way
[1:14:33] through to the bride
[1:14:35] all the way through everyone when he
[1:14:38] took that book when
[1:14:39] batman oh my you know i can't describe
[1:14:42] it
[1:14:43] oh man lord may he reveal this to you
[1:14:48] to make it so real
[1:14:51] the prophet said this was the most
[1:14:54] sublime act in scripture
[1:14:56] because everything that he purchased
[1:14:59] everything that he died for all the
[1:15:02] stripes all the
[1:15:03] disgusting horrible things they did to
[1:15:06] him everything that he suffered and the
[1:15:08] most horrible painful death that could
[1:15:10] ever be died
[1:15:11] he did it even the earth had to testify
[1:15:14] by going dark
[1:15:15] and shake
[1:15:18] he did it for you
[1:15:22] and he did it
[1:15:25] so that we could be redeemed he did it
[1:15:28] let me just i just have to go back to
[1:15:30] this before i go any further
[1:15:32] sorry for stopping but i just have to if
[1:15:35] i go too far
[1:15:36] we'll we'll just go too far too soon
[1:15:40] so it says here in whom also
[1:15:44] we have obtained an inheritance being
[1:15:46] predestinated
[1:15:47] according to the purpose of him who
[1:15:49] worketh all things
[1:15:51] after the council of his own
[1:15:54] will that we should be to the praise of
[1:15:57] his glory
[1:15:58] who first trusted in jesus
[1:16:01] in christ in whom
[1:16:05] ye also trusted after that you heard the
[1:16:08] word of truth
[1:16:09] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:16:11] after that you believed
[1:16:13] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:16:15] promise
[1:16:18] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:16:21] until can everyone say until
[1:16:24] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:16:27] possession
[1:16:29] let me repeat that again so you catch it
[1:16:32] the holy spirit a promise that you were
[1:16:34] sealed by and the all the seven ages
[1:16:36] were sealed by in the church ages and
[1:16:38] they were sealed by the holy ghost they
[1:16:40] really
[1:16:40] had an experience with the holy spirit
[1:16:42] they were sealed and they will rise
[1:16:43] again and we'll be raptured with them
[1:16:45] but they did and physically they're
[1:16:48] actually in glory under the altar with
[1:16:49] the lord
[1:16:50] sealed under their messenger that they
[1:16:53] had in their age whoever god was using
[1:16:55] in their revival in their time right
[1:16:57] they were sealed with them and their
[1:16:59] pastors and their groups and whoever god
[1:17:01] was ministering through the ministry in
[1:17:02] those times
[1:17:03] the people were gathered with their
[1:17:05] people
[1:17:06] sealed by the real holy ghost no
[1:17:09] different than what you have now
[1:17:10] right now that may sound funny but just
[1:17:13] remember it's the same person
[1:17:15] he's always been the same he's always
[1:17:17] been the same person right
[1:17:18] but he just comes with a different type
[1:17:20] of message or a different part of his
[1:17:22] grace
[1:17:22] a different expression of his
[1:17:24] personality but in the end time
[1:17:26] he would come with an open book what for
[1:17:30] to gather everything that he had sealed
[1:17:33] including the ones that are alive and
[1:17:35] remaining hello alive and remaining
[1:17:39] you are the alive and remaining you're
[1:17:41] going to you're getting it now
[1:17:44] it's coming to you now right something
[1:17:47] more than any other
[1:17:48] age and it just sounds so simple and you
[1:17:51] can can you put your finger on it
[1:17:52] well i guess you can if you're a good
[1:17:54] teacher maybe you can teach all of the
[1:17:56] things that he taught that was different
[1:17:57] but
[1:17:58] really to me when i look at it i say
[1:18:02] he came with my inheritance and he came
[1:18:05] not just with it but he said this is
[1:18:06] what it is
[1:18:07] now it's time that i'm going to make you
[1:18:09] worthy to look at it because he was
[1:18:11] worthy he
[1:18:12] was the man that said i'm the i'm
[1:18:14] bringing it back
[1:18:15] you know it was in the hands of the
[1:18:16] father and the devil squatted for all
[1:18:17] these years and
[1:18:18] caused destruction on the earth and
[1:18:20] broken everything down
[1:18:21] and caused religious people but then
[1:18:24] finally one day
[1:18:25] hallelujah he would come and he would
[1:18:27] purchase it and then
[1:18:28] at the end and the fullness of times
[1:18:30] which we've just read
[1:18:32] in the fullness of times he would come
[1:18:35] and redeem his purchase possession
[1:18:38] do you know what that means it says here
[1:18:40] which is so the holy spirit it says
[1:18:43] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:18:45] promise
[1:18:47] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:18:50] right
[1:18:50] so the holy spirit is like the down
[1:18:52] payment of your inheritance
[1:18:54] it's the thing that he gives you so that
[1:18:56] you're sealed until the day of your
[1:18:57] redemption
[1:18:58] so that you can do the works of christ
[1:19:00] so that he can be the christian in you
[1:19:01] so he can change your operating system
[1:19:04] so that you can
[1:19:05] live right and then when you die if you
[1:19:07] die before the rapture
[1:19:08] he will you'll raise again because that
[1:19:10] resurrection's in you right
[1:19:12] but there will come a time when there's
[1:19:14] a living people
[1:19:17] and it says here but that earnest of our
[1:19:19] inheritance
[1:19:21] that down payment of our inheritance the
[1:19:23] holy ghost which were sealed by him were
[1:19:25] in all the other ages
[1:19:27] until the redemption of the purchase
[1:19:30] possession
[1:19:32] so that we are the purchase possession
[1:19:34] they were the purchase possession
[1:19:35] but there has to come a time where
[1:19:37] that's redeemed there has to come a time
[1:19:39] where all of that that was paid for all
[1:19:41] of it that's represented in that book
[1:19:43] that was sealed
[1:19:44] it was represented there and it couldn't
[1:19:46] it wasn't back in man's hands but then
[1:19:48] one day
[1:19:49] he would have to it says redeem the
[1:19:51] purchase possession
[1:19:52] so he would take what he had paid for
[1:19:56] and take what all calvary's meaning and
[1:19:58] everything that he died for
[1:19:59] and he would take it and as our man
[1:20:02] jesus was a man who believes me
[1:20:04] that god became a man and that as a man
[1:20:08] he paid everything and as a man he's
[1:20:10] taking it all to himself
[1:20:12] and we are in the process hello i know
[1:20:14] you've heard all this before but i just
[1:20:15] want to reiterate it you know you've got
[1:20:17] to just obey the lord
[1:20:18] i just have to do it so someone here is
[1:20:20] going to get blessed
[1:20:23] he redeemed it back he's taken it back
[1:20:26] so that we
[1:20:28] can be redeemed to him and as living
[1:20:31] people
[1:20:32] because everyone puts us off into some
[1:20:34] future thing when he comes
[1:20:35] in the third coming well you know when
[1:20:37] he comes to the earth he's going to
[1:20:38] redeem it all but it's happening now
[1:20:41] hallelujah
[1:20:45] the inheritance that adam lost and satan
[1:20:48] squats over
[1:20:49] the title deed the deed of ownership
[1:20:52] purchased at calvary
[1:20:54] must be taken back into human hands and
[1:20:56] handed back to the human race
[1:20:58] the redemption of the purchased
[1:21:00] possession
[1:21:01] you are his purchased possession but you
[1:21:04] need to be
[1:21:06] united together in a rapture and so
[1:21:09] that's why the prophet preached uniting
[1:21:10] time
[1:21:11] and sign says here
[1:21:15] only a man could oh only a man could do
[1:21:17] it because a man lost it
[1:21:19] god in human form shown
[1:21:22] as it had been slain shows the purchase
[1:21:26] that shows he purchased
[1:21:30] this back that's why when you read in
[1:21:31] revelation chapter 5
[1:21:33] when you see when john saw who was
[1:21:36] actually going to get it
[1:21:37] he it's represented as a lamb that had
[1:21:39] been slain
[1:21:40] as a lamb that was covered in blood to
[1:21:43] show that the one that died on calvary
[1:21:45] the one that did it
[1:21:46] the one that sent seven spirits to the
[1:21:48] seven church ages and seven eyes of
[1:21:50] prophetic
[1:21:51] insight to the messengers that that for
[1:21:54] the last two thousand years
[1:21:55] that's the one that stepped forth to
[1:21:58] take the book
[1:21:59] and revelation 5 is identifying that
[1:22:01] this is the one
[1:22:02] that would step forth this is our man
[1:22:04] that would say this is the time
[1:22:06] in 1963 as you know this was the time
[1:22:10] when this would transpire hello yes this
[1:22:13] is a date
[1:22:13] if anyone doesn't know 1963
[1:22:16] is the time where it finally could
[1:22:19] happen
[1:22:19] where all the ages had run out where it
[1:22:22] would come to the time of the fullness
[1:22:24] of time
[1:22:24] where it would be the season for change
[1:22:27] the season for a new dispensation
[1:22:29] the season of the son of man to come on
[1:22:32] the scene
[1:22:33] to take back and begin the process of
[1:22:36] the rapture
[1:22:37] we're being ushered into the millennium
[1:22:39] it's not just
[1:22:40] in a flash you're gone it's in process
[1:22:43] you know
[1:22:43] loading it's loading it's loading it
[1:22:47] it's loading in me it's loading in you
[1:22:49] things are happening right
[1:22:51] god's taking you hallelujah just like he
[1:22:53] took israel
[1:22:54] how's our time going
[1:22:58] god took israel you know and israel
[1:23:00] types the church
[1:23:02] but he took israel from out of egypt out
[1:23:03] of the world and he drowned their
[1:23:05] enemies in the red sea
[1:23:06] but they still had enemies inside them
[1:23:08] right there was still a work to do there
[1:23:10] was redeeming
[1:23:11] to do in their lives they he took them
[1:23:13] out of egypt but you've got to take
[1:23:14] egypt out of them he took you out of the
[1:23:16] world
[1:23:16] but he's going to take the world out of
[1:23:18] you but then once finally it comes a
[1:23:20] time when you cross over
[1:23:22] the jordan river right israel went
[1:23:24] through the wilderness they had their
[1:23:26] times of doubts and unbelies but one
[1:23:28] time
[1:23:28] they crossed over the jordan and when
[1:23:30] they crossed over the jordan they met a
[1:23:32] captain hallelujah
[1:23:33] and when they met that captain they
[1:23:35] because they didn't know how they're
[1:23:36] going to take jericho
[1:23:37] the devil had been preparing that place
[1:23:38] for 400 years he had heard what god said
[1:23:41] to abraham
[1:23:42] and so he got real prepared you know the
[1:23:44] devil hears what god's going to do
[1:23:46] in your life and he begins to prepare to
[1:23:48] stop you
[1:23:49] but nothing can stop you if you listen
[1:23:51] to the captain
[1:23:53] when the captain speaks you say yes and
[1:23:56] if it sounds silly you just do it anyway
[1:23:58] if you don't feel like you want to do it
[1:23:59] just do it because he said it you know
[1:24:01] joshua he went up to that captain
[1:24:03] and you know what he saw in the captain
[1:24:05] he saw a sword in the captain's hands

[1:26:16] father
[1:26:16] the one that took the book out of the
[1:26:18] original owner's hands the one that's
[1:26:20] made it
[1:26:21] real to us the one that says you can
[1:26:24] have it back
[1:26:25] that one comes down into these services

[1:26:34] what with the same sword

[1:26:43] when you get the holy ghost and you come
[1:26:45] out of you come out of the wilderness
[1:26:46] you come out of egypt you come through
[1:26:48] and you get the holy ghost god is going
[1:26:50] to reveal to you
[1:26:51] just how to conquer those enemies and
[1:26:54] has been preached on sunday little by
[1:26:55] little
[1:26:56] not everything all at once just a little
[1:26:59] step at a time
[1:27:00] amen hallelujah
[1:27:18] i'm just going to read this now oh my
[1:27:21] now the forfeited title deed is now in
[1:27:23] the hands of the original owner
[1:27:26] almighty god the title deed to the earth
[1:27:29] and to eternal life
[1:27:32] when adam forfeited it then satan's
[1:27:35] dirty hands could not take it
[1:27:37] see satan didn't have legal rights to it
[1:27:40] so it went back to its original
[1:27:41] owner god himself we're going to find it
[1:27:45] just in a minute
[1:27:46] there he sits on the throne with it in
[1:27:48] his hand the title deed
[1:27:51] oh that makes me feel religious the
[1:27:53] title deed to eternal life
[1:27:55] the abstract title deed to eternal life
[1:27:58] we're about to introduce one more thing
[1:28:00] and then i'll close and that's the
[1:28:01] abstract
[1:28:04] may god help me i'm trying to teach me
[1:28:06] you know
[1:28:07] it just keeps coming out different when
[1:28:09] adam forfeited it for wisdom
[1:28:11] instead of faith it went back to the
[1:28:13] hands of the owner almighty god
[1:28:15] what a great thing all right
[1:28:19] waiting what's it doing in the hands of
[1:28:21] god waiting for redemption claims
[1:28:24] he made a way of redemption he made a
[1:28:26] way back and someday
[1:28:28] the redeemer is to take it back that's
[1:28:30] our jesus
[1:28:32] you see where we're getting to now
[1:28:35] we'll watch this fellow sitting upon the
[1:28:37] throne all right
[1:28:38] waiting for redemption claims it's
[1:28:41] redemption
[1:28:43] this title deed to come back into the
[1:28:45] possession
[1:28:46] of human beings right waiting
[1:28:49] because once that happens there's a
[1:28:52] different authority
[1:28:53] there's a different power that gets
[1:28:54] released right
[1:28:56] upon the people because now that adamic
[1:28:59] covenant that was before the fall gets
[1:29:01] reenacted
[1:29:02] into the people but they have to believe

[1:29:18] grace

[1:29:34] if you don't know what's yours how are
[1:29:35] you going to claim it until he shows you
[1:29:37] what's yours
[1:29:43] but not to show you in your mind but
[1:29:46] by revelation if you just open your
[1:29:50] channel of joy right now it'll become it
[1:29:52] can be revealed to you
[1:29:54] if you're sitting there with your mind
[1:29:55] open all you're going to get is a whole
[1:29:57] bunch of knowledge and it won't help you
[1:29:59] but it just won't help you so i
[1:30:00] encourage you right now just open
[1:30:02] just open your joy channel and say lord
[1:30:04] i honestly i just want to draw
[1:30:06] waters from the wells of salvation this
[1:30:07] morning this evening because i want this
[1:30:09] to become
[1:30:10] so real to me to you
[1:30:13] and this is the burden i believe that
[1:30:16] these things will be made plain
[1:30:18] what is the book of redemption oh sorry
[1:30:21] all right waiting what's it doing
[1:30:23] in the hands of god waiting for
[1:30:24] redemption's claims sorry i've read that
[1:30:26] what is this book of redemption this
[1:30:28] title deed
[1:30:29] abstract title deed you say abstract
[1:30:32] what does an abstract mean
[1:30:34] means it searched all the way back to
[1:30:36] its beginning
[1:30:38] like that that little drop of ink this
[1:30:40] morning when it struck that bleach it
[1:30:42] went all the way back
[1:30:44] and when sin had been confessed and
[1:30:46] fallen into the blood of jesus christ
[1:30:48] oh my it gives an abstract write
[1:30:50] straight back to the creator again
[1:30:53] you become a son of god abstract title
[1:30:56] deed is held in the hands of the
[1:30:57] almighty
[1:30:59] oh my
[1:31:05] this has come back into our position
[1:31:09] to reveal to expose the enemy to expose
[1:31:13] all his devices
[1:31:14] to expose how he's operated all
[1:31:16] throughout time
[1:31:17] but that's just one side it's also come
[1:31:20] to reveal the nature and heart of god to
[1:31:23] reveal the symphony of god
[1:31:25] to reveal the program of god to
[1:31:27] understand where he's at what he's doing
[1:31:29] what where is the rhythm beating out
[1:31:31] where is it at what's happening in this
[1:31:33] very hour
[1:31:34] what's happening in your life are you
[1:31:36] connected to it right
[1:31:37] because see it's come back out of the
[1:31:40] hands of the original owner
[1:31:42] and into jesus hands but in 1963 when
[1:31:45] the seals came
[1:31:46] open he handed this book back when a
[1:31:48] prophet was standing there on mount
[1:31:50] sunset
[1:31:50] and he was standing there and praying
[1:31:52] and then all of a sudden a sword landed
[1:31:54] in his hand
[1:31:55] and and the lord said to him this is the
[1:31:58] king's sword
[1:31:59] and he began to switch the sword around
[1:32:01] you know i think you
[1:32:02] just got to start switching the sword
[1:32:04] around i think you've just got to start
[1:32:05] taking this that's yours
[1:32:07] taking what knowing remember he's
[1:32:09] revealing to you
[1:32:10] what's yours revealing to you what
[1:32:13] belongs to you
[1:32:14] but do you think the devil's just going
[1:32:15] to give it back if you know you're going
[1:32:16] to go claim it
[1:32:17] you're going to get down and pray for it
[1:32:19] amen and then go
[1:32:20] forth because once you get serious with
[1:32:23] god once you really start laying it out
[1:32:25] oh my
[1:32:26] the devil starts to shake he begins to
[1:32:28] have to let it go because
[1:32:29] there's an enforcer behind your prayer
[1:32:32] there's a holy spirit
[1:32:33] to come and enforce the restoration
[1:32:36] because it's yours and then you read a
[1:32:38] little bit more because it's open to you
[1:32:40] because the spirit of god comes down
[1:32:43] into you to reveal to you
[1:32:44] what is yours but you've got to search
[1:32:47] it you've got to begin to expect it
[1:32:49] you've got to come to church and pull on
[1:32:51] the ministry you've got to come and
[1:32:52] you've got to say lord
[1:32:54] i'm getting serious with you now lord if
[1:32:56] there's any besetting sins in my life
[1:32:58] i'm going to get rid of them now because
[1:32:59] it's not worth it anymore
[1:33:01] it's not worth it to do those things
[1:33:03] anymore it's not worth it to speed it's
[1:33:05] not worth it to
[1:33:06] do all of these things that aggravate
[1:33:08] the holy ghost it's not worth it to
[1:33:09] swear
[1:33:10] it's not worth it to drink it's not
[1:33:12] worth it to do anything
[1:33:13] that's going to aggravate the holy
[1:33:15] spirit right it's not worth it
[1:33:17] but we struggle with it you know these
[1:33:19] things happen you see your conscience
[1:33:21] and it begins to become a problem and
[1:33:23] all of a sudden you're like well what
[1:33:24] happened
[1:33:26] and you're in something and it's very
[1:33:28] difficult to get out once your
[1:33:29] conscience is said
[1:33:31] whatever it may be right and we've all
[1:33:33] got weaknesses the devil knows them
[1:33:35] and he'll try and use leverage but
[1:33:37] tonight
[1:33:38] hallelujah and forevermore
[1:33:41] realize what you have realize who you
[1:33:44] have
[1:33:45] realize who you are realize what he's
[1:33:48] made you
[1:33:49] hallelujah realize that there's a power
[1:33:51] inside you
[1:33:52] to claim it all back hallelujah you know
[1:33:55] when they did the abstract search you
[1:33:56] know they
[1:33:57] they when he came down and and opened
[1:33:59] the seals in 63
[1:34:00] you know what was god doing he was
[1:34:02] searching back to the to adam
[1:34:04] searching back everything and showing
[1:34:06] you what all of it's been cleaned off
[1:34:08] you know he preached about the bleach
[1:34:10] you know how the blood would bleach
[1:34:12] and and and the sin of the true believer
[1:34:15] he magnified grace magnified
[1:34:18] justification
[1:34:20] so you're not just forgiven the blood
[1:34:23] doesn't just forgive you
[1:34:25] it completely justifies you justify
[1:34:29] do you know what that means you go to
[1:34:31] court
[1:34:32] and you you and they'd find that you
[1:34:34] you're innocent
[1:34:36] you didn't do it you didn't do it
[1:34:40] that's what the blood does it's bleach
[1:34:44] it takes your sin it takes all the
[1:34:47] unbelief it takes everything
[1:34:48] and you just drop it into the bleach of
[1:34:51] this blood
[1:34:52] of this word of our jesus the one hold
[1:34:56] his hand
[1:34:57] he did it back in calvary all right yeah
[1:34:59] he did it but who
[1:35:00] you've got to meet him that did it
[1:35:02] hallelujah
[1:35:03] just like most of christendom just claim
[1:35:06] that they've forgiven and claimed the
[1:35:07] blood
[1:35:08] but do they know him do they know the
[1:35:10] one
[1:35:11] that did that do they do they understand
[1:35:15] the very program of the one that hung on
[1:35:18] the cross
[1:35:19] this is where it's at because he is the
[1:35:21] dispensation
[1:35:22] he is dispensing mercy he is doing
[1:35:25] something right now
[1:35:26] hallelujah and let me tell you what he's
[1:35:28] doing revelation 10 tells you what he's
[1:35:30] doing
[1:35:31] and what he's done and what what's
[1:35:32] happening he's come down
[1:35:34] with an inheritance and everybody in
[1:35:37] this room
[1:35:38] is listening to this there's an
[1:35:40] inheritance for you
[1:35:42] right here it's all open there's nothing
[1:35:45] held back anymore
[1:35:47] nothing this is right here for you
[1:35:50] you and you can read it now the devil
[1:35:54] doesn't like this
[1:35:55] he hates it because he's being exposed
[1:35:58] and his power is being stripped because
[1:35:59] he
[1:36:00] you realize that every little thing
[1:36:02] that's in your life
[1:36:03] that's against god or is aggravating to
[1:36:05] the holy spirit is a squatter
[1:36:07] not part of you it's not your family
[1:36:09] personality you know like
[1:36:11] yes it may be come from that but it's
[1:36:13] not actually yours
[1:36:15] because we had an abstract title search
[1:36:18] and if you want to know what the
[1:36:19] abstract title searches you just read
[1:36:21] the gospels
[1:36:23] read the gospels and you'll see what the
[1:36:25] abstract title searches
[1:36:27] that's what it is that's his life right
[1:36:30] you look at his life and god searched
[1:36:32] back and that's what he sees
[1:36:34] he sees this perfect life a son of god
[1:36:37] and he sees a man
[1:36:38] coming to his inheritance he sees him
[1:36:40] speak and it happens
[1:36:42] and what does he see he's got a vision
[1:36:43] in front of him and he's like the great
[1:36:45] you know masterpiece like michelangelo
[1:36:47] with a statue of moses and
[1:36:49] he's god's got this image in his mind of
[1:36:51] who you are
[1:36:52] and he's beginning to he's forming it
[1:36:54] and forming it and forming it
[1:36:55] and he's telling you now it's time to
[1:36:58] stand
[1:36:59] now it's time to just to just just just
[1:37:02] completely call the devil's bluff
[1:37:04] now it's time for you to get into what
[1:37:06] has been given to you
[1:37:08] and express it because it's been
[1:37:10] searched back
[1:37:11] everything your life has been searched
[1:37:14] back
[1:37:15] everything nothing held back all
[1:37:19] for you
[1:37:25] it's time to completely remove lucifer
[1:37:28] from the squatters
[1:37:30] perch an abstract search has been made
[1:37:33] back to the original thought of the true
[1:37:35] image of male and female
[1:37:38] and everything an abstract search has
[1:37:40] been searched back to what a real man is
[1:37:42] to what a real woman is to what real
[1:37:44] justification is to what real
[1:37:45] sanctification is
[1:37:46] what is holiness what is the personality
[1:37:49] of god what was hidden in the back part
[1:37:50] of god's mind
[1:37:51] and abstract search was searched all the
[1:37:53] way back so that you
[1:37:55] could be clear so that you could lay
[1:37:58] your stake in the ground and say that's
[1:38:00] it
[1:38:01] this is mine i'm not going to settle for
[1:38:03] anything less but i'm going to walk on
[1:38:05] amen can we have the musicians please
[1:38:13] sunset mountain was one of the turning
[1:38:17] points for mankind
[1:38:19] did you know that sunset mountain
[1:38:23] because in that place a significant
[1:38:25] event took place
[1:38:27] and we know what took place
[1:38:31] how a prophet was standing there a man
[1:38:33] who was born in sin
[1:38:34] shapen an iniquity a man who had tried
[1:38:37] to kill people in his adolescence and
[1:38:39] all sorts of things just like you and i
[1:38:42] born in sin redeemed by the blood
[1:38:45] but a sword landed in his hands to
[1:38:47] declare that
[1:38:49] the portion of grace that was given to
[1:38:51] man when jesus took the book
[1:38:54] and it claimed it back into the
[1:38:55] possession of human beings
[1:38:57] would be could be given to a man that
[1:38:59] was redeemed
[1:39:01] to but not just to have it for in one
[1:39:03] man but in the people that believe this
[1:39:05] message and the people that would walk
[1:39:07] with the same god
[1:39:08] that was introduced with an open book
[1:39:11] would come to the same
[1:39:13] inheritance would come to the same
[1:39:14] redemption would come to the same grace
[1:39:16] would come to the same place with the
[1:39:18] same things
[1:39:20] happening in their lives so that you
[1:39:22] yourself
[1:39:23] can speak and it will happen this is all
[1:39:26] a purpose
[1:39:27] and the purpose of this is for you to
[1:39:29] understand
[1:39:30] that in every age the holy ghost has
[1:39:33] been poured out
[1:39:34] and all the times it's been the same
[1:39:35] holy spirit but in this time
[1:39:38] when he comes to the people he comes
[1:39:40] with an open book
[1:39:41] he comes to what everything to give back
[1:39:43] everything that adam lost
[1:39:45] and let me finish with this one thought
[1:39:48] what did adam lose what did adam lose
[1:39:57] and this is this is the key to the whole
[1:39:58] thing adam lost
[1:40:01] access to the tree of life
[1:40:04] the cherubims the four cherubims the man
[1:40:06] ox line and eagle
[1:40:08] turn their swords against adam and the
[1:40:11] human race and said you can't come back
[1:40:12] into this dimension
[1:40:14] you can't come back into this yet
[1:40:16] there's no way made for you
[1:40:17] you are kicked out of it you cannot come
[1:40:19] back adam because if you touch this and
[1:40:21] eat this you will
[1:40:23] live forever so what is it that's come
[1:40:26] down
[1:40:27] in this end time and the dispensation of
[1:40:29] the fullness of times
[1:40:31] open what is it that the holy ghost is
[1:40:33] holding
[1:40:34] what is in your hand lord now what is in
[1:40:37] your hand
[1:40:37] now lord
[1:40:40] what's what's that last piece of the
[1:40:42] puzzle that you're holding lord
[1:40:44] that if i take this i'm going to what
[1:40:48] live forever so it's a rapturing key
[1:40:52] it's the key to living forever that's
[1:40:54] why
[1:40:55] we everything that adam lost was in that
[1:40:58] so what is that
[1:40:59] if you look at it it's access to the
[1:41:01] tree of life again
[1:41:03] because there's a people at the end time
[1:41:04] that must live forever so they've got to
[1:41:06] eat something that makes them live for
[1:41:09] ever what is it it's the fullness of
[1:41:11] christ
[1:41:12] the fullness of the holy ghost restored
[1:41:14] back into the church
[1:41:16] but it's not just like you know we say
[1:41:19] yeah the fullness of the holy ghost it's
[1:41:20] so good
[1:41:21] but what does that mean what that means
[1:41:23] is
[1:41:24] this open book this inheritance comes
[1:41:27] down
[1:41:28] into your soul because when the holy
[1:41:31] ghost comes down
[1:41:32] he comes down the mighty angel and he
[1:41:34] puts his feet on the land and sea of
[1:41:36] your life
[1:41:38] he puts his feet his brazen feet right
[1:41:40] on the land and see
[1:41:42] what are the land and see is your spirit
[1:41:44] and your flesh those two things that
[1:41:45] trouble you
[1:41:46] but he comes down to give you dominion
[1:41:48] over them and what is he holding
[1:41:51] your inheritance and where is your
[1:41:53] inheritance it is
[1:41:54] in you open
[1:41:58] and it's declaring who you really are to
[1:42:00] the world
[1:42:01] and the contents in there you become a
[1:42:03] beneficiary of the contents
[1:42:06] so do you realize now how privileged you
[1:42:09] really are
[1:42:11] and this wasn't in any other age because
[1:42:13] if it was
[1:42:14] and they were eating so what are you
[1:42:16] eating
[1:42:18] let's play that song he uh i went to the
