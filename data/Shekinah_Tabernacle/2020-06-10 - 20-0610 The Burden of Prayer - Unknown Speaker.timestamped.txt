[53:06] yourself but I'm just going to try to
[53:08] talk you know just we talk easily and
[53:11] then thank you my sister for the Soul
[53:13] I loved her song and it's like she knew
[53:15] that I would love that song I loved it
[53:17] very much it it does something to me the
[53:21] reason I love you is not because what
[53:24] there isn't I love you now it's not
[53:26] because I can stand here and bridge or
[53:28] you gave me your things or you helped me
[53:31] or anything no it's simply because God
[53:34] loves you and I am part of that love of
[53:37] God you know God brought me among you to
[53:40] be with you to call you my brothers and
[53:42] sisters that's the reason I love you I
[53:44] love you because God brought me in this
[53:46] assembly and the preaching from this
[53:49] pulpit changed my life amen
[53:52] that's why I love you when you love
[53:54] people normally you kindly and explain
[53:56] why you love them you just loved you
[53:59] loved them I mean let's just start there
[54:02] tonight I want to speak about as we read
[54:06] I want to put more emphasis on that
[54:07] verse 12 and verse 18 when he says they
[54:10] shall then then shall you call upon me
[54:12] and ye shall go and pray unto me and I
[54:16] will Hyken unto you sorry sure I was
[54:21] just eating some mint just to make sure
[54:23] that my bread is right and you shall
[54:26] seek me and find me and when he shall
[54:30] search for me with all your heart I mean
[54:35] so tonight I want us to speak about the
[54:38] baton of prayer and the baton of Prayer
[54:42] I mean a friend of mine in South Africa
[54:45] send me a clip of where he was preaching
[54:46] a message he was he was said he was
[54:49] talking about prayer and I said to me
[54:51] they Lord put a thought in my heart
[54:53] along those lines about prayer so
[54:56] tonight I want us to speak about the
[54:58] burden of prayer Oh the burden of
[55:01] praying now the burden of Prayer seeking
[55:06] the Lord through prayer amen
[55:08] and maybe we can maybe we can take a
[55:10] context that says why there is no bad
[55:12] enough prayer why
[55:14] the reason why there's no burden of
[55:16] Prayer what is the reason we need to
[55:19] explore this that's all I want us just
[55:21] to talk and I'm talking to the young
[55:23] people also anyone who is below who is
[55:27] 99 and below amen praise the Lord
[55:31] hallelujah yes we read our scripture
[55:35] let's read Luke 16 as well I mean then
[55:38] we can just just get settled and just be
[55:40] relaxed
[55:41] let's look 16 16 16
[55:45] let's read Luke 16:16 as well
[55:51] hallelujah you know sometimes you
[55:55] prepare and you sit there you say when I
[55:56] introduce I'm going to say this what are
[55:58] the James and I what I say this then you
[56:00] come here everything is where you can't
[56:04] remember what you wanted to say and I
[56:06] wanted to save some good ways but I
[56:08] can't remember what I wanted to say but
[56:10] that's why we pray that the Lord is the
[56:13] one who's guiding us that is why we must
[56:15] dedicate ourselves well standing on the
[56:17] podium on the pulpit on the altar to
[56:19] talk to the bride of God God and His
[56:22] angels present you don't just talk as
[56:24] you please you must be led by the Spirit
[56:27] of God amen
[56:28] so I thank God for for taking care
[56:31] otherwise many of us will be in trouble
[56:33] for fling before God you know so may God
[56:36] help us let it look 16
[56:39] that's 16 amen the law and the prophets
[56:43] were until John since the time the
[56:46] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[56:48] perfect into it
[56:50] hallelujah this is about passing this is
[56:55] about pressing and you know we'll read
[57:00] later on some other scripture and
[57:01] Matthew but the two scriptures the
[57:04] Prophet read about them you know when he
[57:05] preached a message in desperation amen
[57:09] and we will look into it later on but
[57:11] just to put your context and look at
[57:13] this this system of burden of Prayer you
[57:17] know the Lord taught us the Lord's
[57:20] Prayer in the Bible right and the Lord
[57:23] taught us how to pray and when you menu
[57:25] of our sins we grew up you know we've
[57:27] been praying
[57:28] every night they taught us how to pray
[57:29] you know we know about training you know
[57:32] we do pray right am i right and then the
[57:37] problem is oh let me not say the problem
[57:39] not the problem the challenge is many
[57:42] times we pray and we pray amiss many
[57:47] times we pray and we don't really mean
[57:50] what we say
[57:51] many times we pray and there's nothing
[57:54] really that is bothering you or that is
[57:57] really a desire dedicated sincere to God
[58:02] you know have you ever say have you ever
[58:04] heard someone say like I love you alone
[58:06] no you can hear that this person don't
[58:09] mean what disease or many times you hear
[58:12] statement that says I don't mean what
[58:13] you say why because they can detect that
[58:16] you are saying it but you don't don't
[58:20] say from your heart
[58:21] there's nothing substantial that you are
[58:23] saying you're just seeing it so I want
[58:27] to talk about having the burden of
[58:29] prayer for God having a burden of prayer
[58:33] to serve God what is the importance of
[58:35] prayer the importance of prayer I want
[58:37] to quote from brother branham's message
[58:39] expectation he says and now I thank each
[58:44] one of you for a few moments ago when
[58:48] you were singing for I am for you I am
[58:52] praying that what does what I want you
[58:55] to do it is prayer I depend on now it is
[58:59] prayer I depend on
[59:00] that's the secret of all the ministries
[59:03] of God prayer that's the secret of all
[59:06] the mysteries of God that is the key
[59:09] that opens the door for every film of
[59:12] God is prayer that's what the prophets
[59:16] is not me sorry I need to make a
[59:18] PowerPoint today but anyone who 1k I can
[59:21] share with you then you can read or
[59:22] Garrido spoken with and enjoy but that's
[59:25] what he's saying
[59:25] he says is key play is what keeps me
[59:28] moving player is what what takes me in
[59:32] this situation
[59:33] question and answers 1954 Oh 103 I'll
[59:38] rather have a church
[59:40] has such a burden of only a heart for
[59:43] prayer then they just state at this
[59:46] altar and it will be here day and night
[59:48] and everything else and in their house
[59:52] was constant in prayer and humble and
[59:55] trying to get the people to God and make
[59:58] and making calls at hospitals and
[1:00:00] visiting and they seek and trying to get
[1:00:02] people to come to church to write I
[1:00:05] rather have then that's all the other
[1:00:08] put together I would rather have that
[1:00:10] than all the other put together that's
[1:00:14] what the Prophet says all those two
[1:00:15] ladies mentioning he says I rather have
[1:00:17] a dedicated church that has a bed and on
[1:00:20] their heart for prayer that's what the
[1:00:23] Prophet sees amen so we come to realize
[1:00:27] that prayer is so important that prayer
[1:00:29] changes things in our life we realize
[1:00:32] that prayer has an effect on your
[1:00:34] relationship with God it improves your
[1:00:37] relationship we were praying amen you
[1:00:40] you see the devil what he likes to do
[1:00:41] let me tell you about this guy but the
[1:00:43] best that I must kick him tonight we
[1:00:45] want to tell him that we are not afraid
[1:00:46] of him hey man by grace by the power of
[1:00:50] the Living God who must not be afraid of
[1:00:52] the devil
[1:00:52] that's what he wants to do you see it's
[1:00:54] a sneaker that's why I read that I love
[1:00:56] that message of in the greatest battle
[1:00:59] ever fought I can beat that message yeah
[1:01:01] through Pat one of general impact to
[1:01:05] until Pat well because you see that's
[1:01:08] where the whole thing started God
[1:01:09] allowed it let me not go there but the
[1:01:11] point I want to show you about the devil
[1:01:13] is that he brings things in our lives
[1:01:15] and when we accept them you see then and
[1:01:18] he puts a condition or he puts a complex
[1:01:21] in our lives to tell our thinking around
[1:01:23] so and then we blame ourselves huh
[1:01:27] that's what he does he turn around and
[1:01:29] then you blame yourself you blame your
[1:01:32] brother you don't see any nothing good
[1:01:34] in yourself
[1:01:35] meanwhile is actually him who started
[1:01:38] back that is the devil that's what he
[1:01:40] does he would make sure that he and you
[1:01:45] know one we need to be aware of how the
[1:01:47] devil operates
[1:01:48] Daniel and the only thing that can make
[1:01:51] us aware of the devil is the Word of God
[1:01:54] the only thing that can make us aware of
[1:01:56] the teeth of the devil is when we take
[1:01:58] time to be with Jesus is when we take
[1:02:01] time in prayer to be with Jesus sister
[1:02:03] Belinda - what is what is going to help
[1:02:05] us transpose him because we will
[1:02:07] understand how he works
[1:02:09] will he will be exposed because stand in
[1:02:12] the presence of a inspired prayer the
[1:02:14] devil amen
[1:02:15] now prayer changes death to life keeps
[1:02:21] the world out of you player player take
[1:02:25] the world away from you the things of
[1:02:27] the world of the devil player removes
[1:02:32] you remove them away from you it chops
[1:02:35] them you know when you chop
[1:02:36] I like chopping those carols you know
[1:02:38] peeling them off you know that's what
[1:02:40] player does to you
[1:02:42] remove the well the dead teenis the
[1:02:44] stars anything bad belongs to the devil
[1:02:46] player removes it brother man can I take
[1:02:49] this okay thank you so now I also wrote
[1:02:52] the other player it improves your
[1:02:54] relationship with God
[1:02:56] that's what prayer does how many believe
[1:02:59] that you can think about even though I'm
[1:03:02] I don't want to run ahead of myself
[1:03:03] you can think about improving this
[1:03:05] relationship think about a situation
[1:03:08] where you and your partner you and your
[1:03:11] wife or your or you or your spouse or
[1:03:13] you and your brother or you or your
[1:03:15] sister you and your teen brother for
[1:03:17] those who are teens you and your twin
[1:03:18] sister
[1:03:19] you and a person that you love so much
[1:03:21] the person who means a lot to you think
[1:03:24] about a situation whereby you love that
[1:03:27] person so much but actually you don't
[1:03:29] engage with that person you don't talk
[1:03:32] you don't express you don't you don't
[1:03:35] have a bonding what happens with that
[1:03:40] relationship what will happen to that
[1:03:43] relationship you know I always play with
[1:03:45] my daughter and I play with the boy's
[1:03:47] mother she's only don't I have so girls
[1:03:49] are playing wrestling
[1:03:54] she's get him to be more stronger than
[1:03:56] me know
[1:03:57] now but the key it's not just about
[1:04:00] pushing and showing here that I can push
[1:04:02] is the bonding you know is the talking
[1:04:04] is that is they're getting into one
[1:04:06] another
[1:04:06] you see that's what improves the
[1:04:09] relationship and that's what we need to
[1:04:12] do with our gods that is when we talk to
[1:04:16] him why don't we tell him how great he
[1:04:18] is when we turned him how wonderful when
[1:04:20] we thank him when we make him gods
[1:04:23] there's no reason why he became God he
[1:04:26] was not God before there is a reason
[1:04:28] because he wanted fellowship he wanted
[1:04:31] to cure he wanted to you he wanted to
[1:04:33] protect and those things he does them to
[1:04:35] us am i right so that is why it is so
[1:04:39] important for us to pray him himself the
[1:04:43] Lord Jesus the Bible says he was a
[1:04:45] prayerful man powerful men so now the
[1:04:52] Lord Jesus Christ him the creator of the
[1:04:55] heavens and earth in flesh he was
[1:04:57] praying so much I don't know any of you
[1:05:01] in here who has passed at ever for 40
[1:05:03] days and 40 nights I don't know and I
[1:05:05] don't want to ask that question what I'm
[1:05:06] saying is he will do such things and a
[1:05:09] pray God who said why need to be
[1:05:13] relationship but they need to be the
[1:05:17] bonding they need to be a finding of one
[1:05:20] another through prayer am i right sooner
[1:05:24] we find that brother branham himself as
[1:05:27] a powerful man a man who was born a
[1:05:30] prophet
[1:05:31] we found that John Wesley the Bible says
[1:05:33] was praying how many times a day how
[1:05:37] many times or was it his mother may I'm
[1:05:42] talking about his mother
[1:05:43] she was playing so much and yet he had
[1:05:46] 17 children you can imagine the washing
[1:05:50] you can imagine the cooking daily you
[1:05:54] and there's no washing machine that time
[1:05:56] there was no dryer there was nothing of
[1:05:58] technology but she was praying more than
[1:06:01] me in you today why why is the bedroom
[1:06:06] of prayer deteriorating what is the
[1:06:08] reason why our prayer life
[1:06:10] is going away obviously we know is the
[1:06:13] cause of the devil was supposed to do
[1:06:17] and is not supposed to be is supposed to
[1:06:19] be the other way around because he is
[1:06:21] the defeated man even from the beginning
[1:06:24] is defeated Amon we are the ones to
[1:06:27] fulfill that was the lord of safe but
[1:06:30] greater things shall you do
[1:06:32] amen now I quoted from this program
[1:06:35] right here hey that was once delivered
[1:06:38] to us 1955 amen and that's why he wants
[1:06:43] to get you alone to himself your prayers
[1:06:45] not so much as well you are or may be
[1:06:49] coming you know for instance be well out
[1:06:52] in the public when you are praying like
[1:06:55] in church or around the altar well not
[1:06:58] that but get alone you'll pray a
[1:07:01] different prayer when you are by
[1:07:04] yourself then you do when you are in
[1:07:08] public slip alone all of you go out and
[1:07:13] just have a real secret meeting place
[1:07:16] where you and the Lord meet several
[1:07:20] times a day and pray this is powerful
[1:07:24] brother isaacman
[1:07:25] he says pray in public pray in church
[1:07:31] praying here with the Orioles
[1:07:33] which is wonderful I like it reading
[1:07:36] there when we get a praying in the
[1:07:37] family as we gather around is good
[1:07:39] assume it's necessary it's needed right
[1:07:44] where you pray alone ah you you create
[1:07:48] different players whether you get in it
[1:07:51] and don't tell no one he says the
[1:07:52] Prophet is this someone he says you need
[1:07:55] to get your secret place where you and
[1:07:58] God alone where you pour your hearts
[1:08:02] that is the key somebody must be asking
[1:08:06] you but I pray and I do that but I get
[1:08:08] to a point way and I don't know what to
[1:08:10] say
[1:08:11] you see you see that is exactly the
[1:08:13] point why you must be alone because it's
[1:08:16] not like there is nothing to say there
[1:08:18] is something to say but the Lord must
[1:08:21] pray through you
[1:08:23] you and the Lord must be in the
[1:08:24] fellowship I'm a man the Spirit of God
[1:08:27] will come down and you talk to God you
[1:08:30] and God and talking and you are
[1:08:32] listening to even and you find yourself
[1:08:34] crying and touching God things that you
[1:08:36] never planned why because that's the
[1:08:39] necessity for prayer that is the whole
[1:08:42] idea why praying alone in your secret
[1:08:46] place is so important
[1:08:48] amen okay I've read that for you but I
[1:08:53] wrote that there are things there for
[1:08:55] brothers and sisters that goes together
[1:08:57] with prayer
[1:08:58] there are things but when you think of
[1:09:01] prayer you can't help but you think of
[1:09:04] them amen Bethan one of them is better
[1:09:08] amen I'm trying to think of a meaningful
[1:09:11] prayer when you are alone and you work
[1:09:13] ie and you are talking to God but yet
[1:09:16] there's nothing in your heart can you
[1:09:19] think of that I cannot think of a
[1:09:21] situation you have a Bedan in your heart
[1:09:25] to express it to God but some sometimes
[1:09:29] we say to the Lord
[1:09:31] I've got such a bed in Lord but you know
[1:09:33] God knows whether you have a bed in or
[1:09:35] not God knows you cannot me and you can
[1:09:38] tell God what we have in what you don't
[1:09:40] have but yet we need to pray and confess
[1:09:43] things to him because our ways are
[1:09:45] powerful our ways come to pass amen
[1:09:48] but the key is this when I say a lot of
[1:09:50] what Abedin and I don't have it he says
[1:09:52] all my child which one are you talking
[1:09:54] about ah the Baron is him Koopas it day
[1:09:58] so me and you if we feelin a bit better
[1:10:02] and to pray we must pray the Lord for
[1:10:04] the better so that the Lord can give us
[1:10:06] a ballon for pray so that we can pray
[1:10:08] him within a Bedan does anybody get me I
[1:10:11] felt like I intended myself there but we
[1:10:14] need to pray in such because the Bible
[1:10:16] says we must ask anything in his name
[1:10:20] and believe anything he'll give you to
[1:10:23] us so what does anything mean sister
[1:10:25] sister she no sorry a lot like maybe I'm
[1:10:28] gonna be a teacher one day but I like
[1:10:30] interacting you know I like it I like
[1:10:32] what what is what is
[1:10:35] what do you I want to say um if you can
[1:10:39] ask anything thank you he says if you
[1:10:42] ask anything in my name I'll give it to
[1:10:44] you so what is anything sometimes the
[1:10:49] devil shows that you know he covers that
[1:10:51] up so that you must not unpack this
[1:10:54] anything to think of anything as maybe
[1:10:58] the money or the clothes or anything you
[1:11:02] must open up your hearts so that God can
[1:11:05] come in and express those things brother
[1:11:07] end us please and I said the devil likes
[1:11:09] to hide things in our hearts or
[1:11:10] somewhere in our lives because he knows
[1:11:12] that God is so powerful that if anything
[1:11:16] comes to his light it cannot stand so he
[1:11:19] hide things only him can know he used
[1:11:22] them when that rare item comes for him
[1:11:24] because he's an opportunist you see so
[1:11:26] when the right time comes he pulls that
[1:11:28] cut and say hey you know that you stole
[1:11:30] yeah you now you say you're a believer
[1:11:33] he's our accuser so ordinarily he
[1:11:36] wouldn't when you are in a good state
[1:11:37] you wouldn't remind you because you know
[1:11:38] that you say my brother please forgive
[1:11:40] me I I kicked you out your car when I
[1:11:43] passed the I'm so sorry you won't remind
[1:11:45] you that if you are in a good state you
[1:11:48] undermined you because you know you'll
[1:11:49] expose it confess it your brother
[1:11:51] forgives you then you move on in victory
[1:11:53] knows that but he keeps things to use
[1:11:56] them in the future he works with your
[1:11:57] files when is the right time he pulls
[1:12:01] them so you must not allow the devil you
[1:12:03] must even actually ask God to bring
[1:12:06] those things to remembrance and pray for
[1:12:09] God to bring them
[1:12:10] I like the Prophet you know one day they
[1:12:12] gave up and they wanted to expose him
[1:12:15] they won't have to prove him to be a
[1:12:16] false prophets Allah Allah he said no
[1:12:18] praise the Lord I love to be exposed I
[1:12:21] want them to spose me if those guys to
[1:12:23] do anything that I've done wrong before
[1:12:26] go to expose me praised be the name of
[1:12:28] the Lord that's what I want
[1:12:29] amen but you see it wasn't a prophet of
[1:12:32] what he knew there's nothing that
[1:12:35] they're going to expose they were only
[1:12:36] going to expose themselves
[1:12:37] amen I don't want to deviate better than
[1:12:39] is what I was talking about me and you
[1:12:42] must have a bed if we don't have a bed
[1:12:45] and then you must escort for a bed think
[1:12:48] about doing
[1:12:49] without your substance think about doing
[1:12:51] something without them without a
[1:12:53] heaviness of heart will you really be
[1:12:57] persistent
[1:12:58] will you be will you be will you follow
[1:13:01] that up you'll probably even forget the
[1:13:03] next day or the next month that you ask
[1:13:06] hurt and when God gives you the Lord is
[1:13:09] so wonderful but you were praying for
[1:13:11] that right God needs to put a Bedan in
[1:13:15] our hearts so that when we pray we pray
[1:13:18] with a meaningful with a really inspired
[1:13:21] heart with a crying heart that is bedand
[1:13:24] you'll hear the Prophet now another
[1:13:26] thing is sincerity these things you that
[1:13:30] you cannot cut them away from prayer to
[1:13:33] be sincere just like a you saw to be
[1:13:36] sincere when you pray you you ask God
[1:13:39] how can I explain sincerity those who
[1:13:42] are born English must help me
[1:13:44] you know when when he was in Syria it
[1:13:46] means that you are so you're so open yes
[1:13:52] so many what you're saying you are so
[1:13:54] dedicated so real when you say lord
[1:13:58] please I'm asking for genuine right in
[1:14:02] requesting the Lord that sincerity to
[1:14:05] put all your heart in what you you mean
[1:14:08] what you see before the Lord one day I
[1:14:11] meant what I say before the Lord and it
[1:14:13] might not be a nice example but one day
[1:14:16] I found myself
[1:14:18] meaning what I meant before when I meant
[1:14:21] it
[1:14:22] I really meant it reminds me of when the
[1:14:25] Prophet said when he was in that vision
[1:14:27] and and and that boy shot him and then
[1:14:31] he went to hell you know he was going
[1:14:33] down it reminds me when the Prophet said
[1:14:36] O Lord if you save me here I'm going to
[1:14:38] be a good boy he meant because it was
[1:14:43] between life and death
[1:14:45] the prayer that I'm talking about
[1:14:47] tonight is the prayer of life and death
[1:14:50] you will hear just now Amen my own
[1:14:54] little testimony one day I was swimming
[1:14:56] in a swimming pool us with my wife and
[1:14:58] we are singing
[1:14:58] Lenny how to see Amy Amy Amy Amy and you
[1:15:01] know what it was along
[1:15:03] woman maybe from there to the end and
[1:15:06] we're swimming and then I made to be I
[1:15:08] wanted to be a pro and I you know you
[1:15:10] would see me in there and rest on door
[1:15:12] swim back and rest swim there and rest
[1:15:15] so I went I went I never rested I went
[1:15:17] and I went without RISD when I was in
[1:15:20] the middle of the pool man I got tired
[1:15:24] suddenly I was just losing energy I and
[1:15:26] the pool was was deep it was it was
[1:15:29] deeper than than my height and I
[1:15:32] realized that now in the middle of the
[1:15:34] pool the devil come in aha you can't
[1:15:36] seem you know that day and I look on the
[1:15:39] side of the pool is fine it was a big I
[1:15:41] look on the left is far I check where I
[1:15:43] was going is far I checked behind me is
[1:15:45] far I think my wife can assume also that
[1:15:48] time I'm going I'm going down that time
[1:15:51] and I try every other thing that I read
[1:15:55] about see me you know I went under the
[1:15:56] water I said they say if you go under
[1:15:58] the water you do this when you come out
[1:16:01] you then I did that everything happens
[1:16:04] so fast when I bring my head I found
[1:16:07] that hours on the same sport the water
[1:16:10] that time is coming in my mouth I'm
[1:16:12] panicking now when I said to my wife
[1:16:14] help she thinks I'm talking and she was
[1:16:17] the tell you listen I used to joke and
[1:16:19] say help meanwhile she's just floating
[1:16:21] somehow I thought I'm playing the same
[1:16:24] chick she didn't help she that time then
[1:16:27] the heart starts to beat I knew that if
[1:16:30] no one can help me here I'm date because
[1:16:32] I already following daughter and I'm
[1:16:35] trying so hard so what is he lies that
[1:16:39] I'm not playing remember she can see
[1:16:42] myself so hot mosquito we will drown
[1:16:45] both of us so I was in the water at that
[1:16:49] moment at that moment the Lord gave me a
[1:16:52] thought to speak to you you see God is
[1:16:54] gracious and I said to the Lord Lord I
[1:16:56] promise you I promise the Lord things
[1:17:00] you will promise the more things when is
[1:17:03] about your life when you are about to
[1:17:05] die there's more life you will tell the
[1:17:08] Lord things that you are sincere you
[1:17:11] will tell the Lord that Lord yes that
[1:17:14] date was me who did them you
[1:17:17] you'll promise the Lord that you're
[1:17:20] going to do things you attend and what
[1:17:21] you are going to tell the Lord you're
[1:17:23] not going to be joking
[1:17:24] you will be meaning for real in
[1:17:27] otherwise you'll be sincere and I
[1:17:29] promise the Lord as soon as I've
[1:17:31] finished for missing the Lord my wife
[1:17:32] gorgeous a long brush you know these
[1:17:35] brushes that we used to clean the pool
[1:17:37] with along it was there all the time
[1:17:38] she just took it and came oh sorry she
[1:17:41] threw me that little chip like this
[1:17:45] chair you know and she threw it to me
[1:17:47] then that ship came an adjusted here
[1:17:51] where I can reach it that time you call
[1:17:55] the name of the Lord sincerely the point
[1:17:57] I'm trying to show you brother and
[1:17:59] sister is that there is times when we
[1:18:01] pray and we are not sincere we don't
[1:18:03] mean what we are really saying to the
[1:18:06] Lord amen and that can happen but when
[1:18:09] you get to a time where you are alone
[1:18:11] when you make that time when you are
[1:18:13] sincerely in your private place when you
[1:18:15] talk to God pray to show that you're
[1:18:20] praying you are between life as if you
[1:18:22] are between life and death that's the
[1:18:25] kind of attitude in prayer another way
[1:18:28] oh by the way I eventually grab that
[1:18:30] that chip I put it here on my neck and I
[1:18:35] was floating and I was so thankful I so
[1:18:38] much appreciated oxygen very much with
[1:18:42] all my heart I appreciated to breathe I
[1:18:47] to breathe to breathe fresh air that day
[1:18:51] amen
[1:18:52] so that's what happened so we don't want
[1:18:54] to get in dust inside situations in
[1:18:56] order for us the Prophet says many times
[1:18:58] we get disparate and I'm just jumping
[1:19:01] ahead of myself we get disparate because
[1:19:03] of the Emergencies around us because of
[1:19:05] the situations in our lives and we get
[1:19:07] disparate but in essence it's not
[1:19:09] supposed to be like that we are not
[1:19:11] supposed to be push them to a point
[1:19:13] where now we are desperate we are
[1:19:15] supposed to be desperate every time we
[1:19:18] come to God I'm alive I supposed to show
[1:19:22] that hey we are at war we are here
[1:19:25] fighting between death
[1:19:28] life yes yes given us the victory yes is
[1:19:32] guaranteed but the war it's not over
[1:19:35] it's not when they tell you that you are
[1:19:37] the winner you want don't worry
[1:19:39] you won does that mean that you're not
[1:19:40] supposed to run anymore no you are still
[1:19:43] going to run many times who used to know
[1:19:46] sorry to give this bad example but many
[1:19:49] times we used to know that our Brazil
[1:19:51] will win the soccer yeah soccer welcome
[1:19:53] we used to know that I mean it was
[1:19:54] hopeless
[1:19:55] some of us - why cause you know Brazil
[1:19:57] is going to beat everyone even them like
[1:20:00] they noon although it was not a foregone
[1:20:02] conclusion but they had to play and play
[1:20:06] with dedication because if they can't
[1:20:08] even they are the champions 10 for 10 15
[1:20:12] times champions they can lose after
[1:20:14] sports people they will tell you Josh
[1:20:16] and them will tell you today even if you
[1:20:18] are the champion you must've practiced
[1:20:20] be dedicated day and night because in
[1:20:25] this case of sports your winning is not
[1:20:27] guaranteed but with us is guaranteed but
[1:20:30] the devil must be kicked so that the
[1:20:33] word can be fulfilled them but he was
[1:20:35] defeated otherwise you will be defeated
[1:20:39] persistent is another way to persistent
[1:20:41] a prayer without persistent you can
[1:20:46] think of a hips and hips a sister
[1:20:48] Shannon let's do it hips you know you
[1:20:51] can think of heaps of examples in the
[1:20:53] Bible about people who were persistent
[1:20:56] people who were persistent with God
[1:20:59] Jacob among them they were persistent
[1:21:01] with God they did not let it go that is
[1:21:04] not they were persistent and that is
[1:21:06] what goes with the meaningful sincere
[1:21:10] committed prayer another word is I'm
[1:21:13] just telling you the things that I
[1:21:15] believe are very important and you
[1:21:17] cannot think of prayer without them
[1:21:20] crying you know the kind I'm talking
[1:21:25] about mothers and sisters it's not the
[1:21:26] crying of just mama ring it's not the
[1:21:31] crime of complaining system.i it's not
[1:21:33] the complaining
[1:21:34] MooMoo of say army Lord me wonder Buster
[1:21:39] brother Benoit see on Sunday
[1:21:41] spoiled your singing hanging you know
[1:21:43] that's not the type of crying God does
[1:21:46] not want a mom arena that's why he said
[1:21:48] to Moses why cry because what cry for
[1:21:51] Moses was not the one that he was
[1:21:54] supposed to cry it was supposed to be a
[1:21:56] war cry it was supposed to be a car that
[1:21:59] says the sea open and he's crying the
[1:22:02] Stephen open was supposed to be the
[1:22:05] crime not the people and a being under
[1:22:09] pressure
[1:22:09] no no no no that's not the cry that I'm
[1:22:12] talking about the credit I'm not talking
[1:22:15] about is the one of cry it won't cry
[1:22:18] when the angels are crying in heaven day
[1:22:21] and night the Bible says they say holy
[1:22:23] holy holy unto the Lord crying before
[1:22:27] God because they know he's victorious
[1:22:30] I'm not talking about the cry where you
[1:22:32] says our Lord why me Lord why me no no
[1:22:35] that's not the crime I'm talking about
[1:22:37] why you who must be if not who you who
[1:22:41] who must be because they are not has got
[1:22:46] confidence in you that you will overcome
[1:22:51] that message brother so much and and by
[1:22:55] the way this someone you know couldn't
[1:22:58] come at a better time because in the
[1:23:00] past Wednesdays and Sundays men man I
[1:23:03] was enjoying myself it's like the
[1:23:05] rollers just preparing me with those
[1:23:07] someone's you know brother nd spoke
[1:23:08] about laughs and he's not finished
[1:23:10] and you'll hear now what the Lord was it
[1:23:12] and brother as I suppose about that one
[1:23:13] of the DNA you know that that just shake
[1:23:16] me you will I love exploring the science
[1:23:18] of God I love exploring how God was and
[1:23:21] I'll add I like taking these physical
[1:23:22] things and showing them on the spiritual
[1:23:24] things you know so so that crying to a
[1:23:30] point where you move God crying to a
[1:23:34] point where by not not complaining you
[1:23:36] know that there's two types of crying
[1:23:38] crying owner this many times okay
[1:23:40] there's many yes many times as many ways
[1:23:43] to cry but the two key ones that I'm
[1:23:45] talking about is this crying where you
[1:23:47] your cry will on my god well not my god
[1:23:52] with your cry let it be a cry of
[1:23:55] inspiration let it be a cry of calling
[1:23:58] with Qi well it does not seem that there
[1:24:01] is lifting let it be a cry but since I
[1:24:03] am here alone
[1:24:05] my brother is back yes Lord up let it be
[1:24:08] a crime that says Lord you said I must
[1:24:10] ask you for anything so I'm asking you
[1:24:13] for my sister for my brother for my
[1:24:16] cousin for my knees for my wife to
[1:24:18] overcome this and I know Lord it doesn't
[1:24:22] matter what the devil does this you
[1:24:24] shall do that must be the cry reminding
[1:24:27] god of what he said that's the kind of
[1:24:30] cried god ones so when you pray you pray
[1:24:32] along those lines
[1:24:33] crying confessing what God has promised
[1:24:37] to do that's the type of prayer that I'm
[1:24:39] talking about that's the kind of a cry
[1:24:41] that says Lord did it not is it not you
[1:24:44] open the Red Sea law but it's not you
[1:24:47] who has this Shadrach Meshach and
[1:24:48] Abednego because you my father my god it
[1:24:51] was you who was with Daniel it was you
[1:24:54] Lord and now you who you said in the
[1:24:56] book of Hebrews you are the same God the
[1:24:58] same yesterday today and forever and I
[1:25:01] believe that you are here today doesn't
[1:25:04] matter what the devil say to you it
[1:25:06] doesn't matter what the circumstances
[1:25:08] are those three improvise and my data
[1:25:11] shoot they said listen listen even if
[1:25:16] God cannot save us from this fire right
[1:25:22] you see they are prepared to die because
[1:25:26] this is about life and death they are
[1:25:28] prepared to die okay I didn't hear many
[1:25:34] Amy's let me read for you let me let me
[1:25:37] read for you I'll come back here the
[1:25:39] process says well what are you going
[1:25:42] what are you going to amount to if we
[1:25:44] gain the whole world hmm
[1:25:46] what are we what what are we living for
[1:25:50] same spoken rate of desperation 1963 Oh
[1:25:55] 901 same what are we living for what do
[1:26:00] you work for
[1:26:01] what are you eating for what are you
[1:26:04] struggling for and he says the prophet
[1:26:08] too
[1:26:09] although things are due to leave right
[1:26:11] so what are you leaving for them he says
[1:26:15] to die to leave so that when you leave
[1:26:22] you finish living you die but the
[1:26:25] progress changes around and say and the
[1:26:27] you are not fit to leave until you are
[1:26:30] fit to die you see you need to be
[1:26:34] prepared to die so that you can leave
[1:26:38] and that's what started Michigan a bit
[1:26:41] vehicle we're prepared they were not
[1:26:43] joking they meant let us die if possible
[1:26:47] if need be but we know that our God is
[1:26:49] able to save us from the fire but we can
[1:26:52] bow to to the idol we cannot let's
[1:26:55] rather die and then they die so why does
[1:27:00] not allow you to die no he allow you in
[1:27:03] the situations until the very edge
[1:27:06] sometimes too much on the edge and you
[1:27:10] think Lord I will fall I'm dead this you
[1:27:12] want I'm here but it was he knows that
[1:27:15] even if you fall he can catch you he
[1:27:18] knows that that's the Lord that we save
[1:27:21] amen he knows he can leave you to go
[1:27:24] because what did the devil say to the
[1:27:26] Lord that even the Angels the devil he
[1:27:30] knows so if the devil knows we are
[1:27:35] supposed to repeat that to him Emily
[1:27:38] I'm back to where I was so there's such
[1:27:41] a long list of the things that are
[1:27:43] associated with prayer faith is among
[1:27:45] them amen think of a relationship of a
[1:27:47] man and a woman if you are a married man
[1:27:49] Oh another example if for someone that
[1:27:51] you love your mom your dad think about
[1:27:53] that that kind of a relationship
[1:27:55] amen amen think about it and you find
[1:27:58] that if you're not constantly thinking
[1:28:01] about a talking to her about your laugh
[1:28:05] about your things about what she means
[1:28:07] to you
[1:28:07] how would that relationship goes and our
[1:28:09] relationship with God is supposed to be
[1:28:11] like that we're supposed to to be
[1:28:14] talking to him let's conduct our
[1:28:16] scriptures that we read you know what I
[1:28:19] forgot that thing at the back they ruin
[1:28:21] that
[1:28:22] you call it of a slob that draws first
[1:28:25] off let's come across scripture that we
[1:28:30] read in Luke chapter what did we read
[1:28:34] thank you my boy
[1:28:35] look we read Luke chapter 16 the law and
[1:28:39] the prophets were until John since that
[1:28:41] time the kingdom of God is preached and
[1:28:44] every man presses on to eat amen
[1:28:47] meaning that pray he's not going to be a
[1:28:52] piece of cake it's not going to be you
[1:28:55] know what they say it cannot just the
[1:28:57] devil won't just give you to your knees
[1:28:58] silver platter and say here pray in my
[1:29:04] language you conduct diabolo
[1:29:05] you call him Thiago in my language the
[1:29:07] dinner he cannot let everything come
[1:29:10] easy because God made him that way to
[1:29:13] fight me and you to fight us he was he
[1:29:16] knows he will put his spirit inside us
[1:29:18] so that we can be able to fight back and
[1:29:22] overpower the devil he knows that so he
[1:29:25] cannot let the devil be easy because
[1:29:27] that will that will will will will have
[1:29:30] what is the weight that will will
[1:29:33] disprove what God wants to do what God
[1:29:36] was who is the devil to be as arrived
[1:29:37] according to the terms and conditions
[1:29:39] that he gave to be alive to be heart to
[1:29:42] be whatever he was to be to be cool to
[1:29:45] us so that it can be proven what God
[1:29:47] wants to do through me and you and one
[1:29:50] of those things is through prayer you
[1:29:52] will see now I'm gonna read codes for
[1:29:54] you amen going back to the scripture the
[1:29:57] Bible says now not just simply walks in
[1:30:00] to eat easily but it's got to be pressed
[1:30:03] into it has to be pressed on your hearts
[1:30:07] it has to be a Bedan it has to be
[1:30:10] something that when you go to God you
[1:30:12] mean eat because the kingdom of God
[1:30:14] cannot be taken just by walking like
[1:30:16] they know me I'm a winner I'm a champion
[1:30:19] know enough to play I won no I must
[1:30:22] practice even more than those who has to
[1:30:26] take the cup away from me amen listen to
[1:30:30] Jeremiah did you read Jeremiah
[1:30:33] whether you seek me with all your
[1:30:36] Hut then you'll find me when you seek me
[1:30:40] with all your heart
[1:30:42] there's no way in which I'm going to
[1:30:44] play a meaningful heart if you don't
[1:30:46] pray to God with all your heart with all
[1:30:49] your heart and then you shall seek me
[1:30:51] and they find me whether you shall
[1:30:53] assess for me with all your heart
[1:30:56] not all your mind with all your heart
[1:30:59] you are going to find me what does he
[1:31:01] say a vest prior to that better you
[1:31:05] shall come upon me and then you shall go
[1:31:08] and pray unto me this is a deep prayer
[1:31:11] man this is not this is not Lord bless
[1:31:13] this food we are going to eat ah isn't
[1:31:15] that one you have to mean it
[1:31:17] you have to be sincere right those are
[1:31:22] the ones that I'm talking about in
[1:31:23] public when you play for the foods you
[1:31:25] know depending on their own they on the
[1:31:27] taste of foods yes your prayer is
[1:31:29] according to that you know when it's so
[1:31:31] it's not supposed to be that way you
[1:31:33] know so children let's doing it they let
[1:31:37] you know that excited about the type of
[1:31:39] a meal we are visiting brother India
[1:31:41] bravado is so happy thank you
[1:31:43] you know you can hear my brother the
[1:31:45] suspense hippy right but our player is
[1:31:48] supposed to be so sincere but even when
[1:31:50] we thank the Lord for the food we mean
[1:31:52] they we mean what we are saying the Lord
[1:31:55] loves a sincere heart hallelujah amen
[1:31:59] let's just proceed there again in the
[1:32:02] spoken out of testimony amen 1950 Oh
[1:32:07] 8:14 testimony right I'm not saying that
[1:32:10] to scare you I'm saying it just
[1:32:13] ascending saintly person and I know how
[1:32:18] to stand here in this platform and say
[1:32:20] but my heart's been stirred for a time
[1:32:23] and I know that we are ready for
[1:32:25] something now coming and you Christians
[1:32:28] don't stay in that leucon condition
[1:32:31] anymore lay aside everything does get as
[1:32:34] close to God as you can walk with him
[1:32:38] talk with him it's not prayer and his
[1:32:42] prayer talking to God let everything
[1:32:45] else be secondary but your prayer life
[1:32:48] stay right with
[1:32:49] him all the time can you see now that
[1:32:54] can be a problem for some to stay with
[1:32:56] him at all time but it's not a problem
[1:32:58] if you look at it differently you can
[1:33:00] ask God to give you that that mind of
[1:33:03] thinking about him all the time when you
[1:33:06] walk when you do your washing ah when
[1:33:10] you when you do your dishes
[1:33:11] well you anything you can ask God to
[1:33:14] help you that 90% of the time if not
[1:33:16] hundred and ten you're thinking about
[1:33:19] you my dad was telling me that you know
[1:33:21] the world is such a sneaker he created
[1:33:24] this he not he created he made and set
[1:33:26] up this world in such a way that it will
[1:33:28] take that thoughts of God away from us
[1:33:31] to be so busy do not do that brother nd
[1:33:34] singer to be so busy think that well
[1:33:36] that we don't plan with what we plan our
[1:33:39] life is already planned out in as far as
[1:33:41] the world is concerned
[1:33:42] take everything technology everything
[1:33:44] man when you when you go to sleep oh
[1:33:46] you've got one hour one hour you must be
[1:33:49] up the devil set it up that way he's
[1:33:52] gonna set it up in your dream it comes
[1:33:54] your doom and then you stage of dreaming
[1:33:56] about God you dream about oh if I can
[1:33:59] get that deal that would be lovely
[1:34:01] will be happy he set up everything so we
[1:34:06] need to be able to counter that by pray
[1:34:09] by meditating about God we need to be
[1:34:13] able to repel that kind the system of
[1:34:16] the devil that he made for us to repel
[1:34:19] it in and still survive in this earth
[1:34:22] because remember God knows everything of
[1:34:25] your needs he knows you don't have to
[1:34:27] stay you don't have to stress and to
[1:34:29] think about what will happen tomorrow
[1:34:30] what you'll eat tomorrow of course you
[1:34:32] must still have but what I'm trying to
[1:34:34] say is that nothing must occupy your
[1:34:36] heart toward you yes if you are not a
[1:34:39] daughter or a son of God no no no no no
[1:34:41] that leaves it to the Lord what you need
[1:34:44] to be thinking about is how wonderful he
[1:34:47] is how Lord as he is is how good he and
[1:34:51] tell him
[1:34:53] ah and Olivia desperations again now I
[1:35:00] believe that we are living in the days
[1:35:01] that we are all otherwise the day that
[1:35:04] we are living in should cause the chance
[1:35:06] to go completely into desperation you
[1:35:09] see the reason why is the lord I thank
[1:35:12] him so much because I was struggling and
[1:35:14] the Lord just brought this broken with
[1:35:16] that talks too much or so much about
[1:35:19] what I want to speak about and he says
[1:35:21] you see we need to be desperate they'll
[1:35:24] jump something there and we need to be
[1:35:27] so desperate I believe that the church
[1:35:29] in a complete desperation I believe it
[1:35:33] ought to throw his entire congregation
[1:35:35] into desperation that we we have placed
[1:35:38] L we have played alone enough we have
[1:35:42] played long enough
[1:35:43] we have went to church long enough we've
[1:35:46] got to do something
[1:35:47] we are going to change too long we have
[1:35:50] played for too long we need to come to
[1:35:53] their point of sincerity we need to come
[1:35:55] ask and our children us and everyone
[1:35:58] around us amen and continuing with that
[1:36:02] spoken with signs of his coming should
[1:36:05] throw every member of Christ into
[1:36:07] desperation now the science of the
[1:36:10] Lord's coming what do we see now Korona
[1:36:12] we are see what nations are raising
[1:36:15] against nations we are see what
[1:36:17] earthquakes in divers manners we are
[1:36:19] seeing every other sign around us that
[1:36:22] the coming of the Lord is here but is
[1:36:26] supposed to throw us into desperation we
[1:36:29] have to be making every day sure but if
[1:36:32] I am okay if I feel unsettled I'm okay
[1:36:36] it's my wife right he's my dog takes my
[1:36:38] brother he says brother branham in the
[1:36:41] prayer
[1:36:41] don't even be praying for yourself pray
[1:36:44] for someone else huh but when you pray
[1:36:48] for someone else when you're been in
[1:36:50] their bed in that's when God blesses you
[1:36:52] the more you pray for someone for the
[1:36:56] bed and entering into someone's problem
[1:36:58] filling as it is yours that's when God
[1:37:02] was God he knows he knows your need he
[1:37:05] knows what is worrying you
[1:37:06] you know she I diseases that you don't
[1:37:08] even know in your body he knows them and
[1:37:10] I still allowed this animal to still
[1:37:12] bring them to you
[1:37:13] this devil must not respect the devil
[1:37:16] brother been said we must we must kick
[1:37:18] him here we must kick him unashamedly
[1:37:23] and don't stay a shoe and you kick him
[1:37:26] kick him amen
[1:37:29] you must come and when you are desperate
[1:37:32] then God is going to listen to you when
[1:37:35] you are desperate but if you are just
[1:37:37] slothful you know it is to be a slothful
[1:37:39] to be lazy to be lethargic in English DC
[1:37:45] to be to be too you know but when you
[1:37:50] ask lawful you don't care whether he
[1:37:52] does it or not well that's a different
[1:37:56] you say you do but it takes desperation
[1:38:00] to do it it takes desperation you see
[1:38:04] not the panicking no desperation that
[1:38:07] Lord this I cannot let you go until you
[1:38:10] give it to me isn't it brother Marion
[1:38:12] amen
[1:38:13] and then can I say the reason we can't
[1:38:19] have a bad end of prayer is because we
[1:38:23] are not desperate enough this is not the
[1:38:25] Prophet this is me now I'm asking you a
[1:38:27] question
[1:38:27] can we say that but the reason we don't
[1:38:29] have a pair for life the reason we don't
[1:38:32] come to God the way the Prophet is
[1:38:34] saying here is because we are not
[1:38:36] desperate enough can I say that I don't
[1:38:39] know if I can say that but it looks like
[1:38:40] it from all probabilities it looks like
[1:38:43] it it looks like we lack desperation it
[1:38:46] looks like what what what then we'll
[1:38:49] cross the desperation
[1:38:51] what should cause desperation then I
[1:38:54] should cause the desperation if ever God
[1:38:58] will hear us when we are desperate when
[1:39:00] we mean when we are sincere when we mean
[1:39:03] it
[1:39:03] well when we are persistent when we are
[1:39:06] resilient in prayer huh when we mean all
[1:39:09] those things and we don't get desperate
[1:39:12] what is the cause of it
[1:39:15] well as the problem let's look into that
[1:39:18] subject Ilya Ilya own I mean a little
[1:39:20] bit and that will take us more into what
[1:39:21] brother industries I loved it I loved
[1:39:23] that subject of love you see because
[1:39:25] it's so powerful and the Prophet just
[1:39:27] brought it to my face man I said brother
[1:39:29] nd must have read this because the
[1:39:33] Prophet the Lord just brought you to me
[1:39:35] and I I didn't want to make noise for my
[1:39:37] wife she was sleeping I wanted to just
[1:39:39] to jump and because I had the Lord
[1:39:42] speaking to me in that message and you
[1:39:44] know it is I believe that the reason we
[1:39:47] don't have desperation is because is a
[1:39:51] lack of love God the love of God cannot
[1:39:57] be true we lack the love of God us
[1:40:01] that's why you don't get disparate why
[1:40:04] are we getting why are we not getting
[1:40:06] disparate dinner I think that the love
[1:40:09] of God causes desperation the Prophet
[1:40:11] says I think that the love of God causes
[1:40:14] desperation that's paragraph 67 if God
[1:40:17] is in you the Trojan is inside you you
[1:40:20] see this is after preaching the message
[1:40:22] token and I wanted to really I just did
[1:40:24] not have time I want because you pushed
[1:40:26] it after a morning then the evening you
[1:40:28] press this one so the Prophet at the
[1:40:30] beginning was just going on about token
[1:40:32] token token and I almost got confused
[1:40:34] which way to go what does the Prophet
[1:40:37] was no no no I must not be confused the
[1:40:41] Word of God is the mountain of breaks
[1:40:43] it's a big mountain you can go and eat
[1:40:47] anywhere that is why you can be any sane
[1:40:50] man the proper thing that I'm talking
[1:40:52] about this mess no no no yeah you are
[1:40:54] digging from the mountain of breads ah
[1:40:57] if the mountain of bread is not short
[1:41:00] for us to eat it
[1:41:02] no it's everywhere you can jump on top
[1:41:05] and dig from is the mountain of bread
[1:41:08] that's why I tried the proper to store
[1:41:11] the food for us even if God is sending
[1:41:15] you the totally inside of you and you
[1:41:17] see the conditions of time and the
[1:41:19] people while waiting what does that word
[1:41:22] mean waiting w ad ing waiting in sin the
[1:41:27] way they are
[1:41:28] it will throw you into desperation I
[1:41:31] believe it will I believe it will
[1:41:34] amen amen now now the word plane States
[1:41:39] if you want to put this down
[1:41:41] Colossians five and six faith worketh by
[1:41:45] love here the properties time to bring
[1:41:48] the fed but we are talking about rather
[1:41:50] sorry but sorry me and him fellowship be
[1:41:53] a lot around you subject and I've got
[1:41:54] excited I said brothers talking about
[1:41:56] what I want to talk about but from a
[1:41:58] different angle
[1:41:58] you see faith cannot have faith without
[1:42:01] love faith worketh by love faith waken
[1:42:08] by love and the only way that you can
[1:42:10] have faith is have lab tests because
[1:42:14] after all
[1:42:15] faith is loves incentive is an incentive
[1:42:18] of love fake but on the on the pyramid
[1:42:22] we see face these all the virtues love
[1:42:25] must be there you can see stay at the
[1:42:27] bottom there laughs on top love at the
[1:42:29] bottom faces is though when you get
[1:42:33] faith is one God incentivize you love
[1:42:37] first love first how can you you you
[1:42:43] have faith in someone that you don't
[1:42:44] love you have to put them I've got
[1:42:50] confidence in this guy mean no they mean
[1:42:52] that they like him they like the
[1:42:55] attitude they like everything is doing
[1:42:56] they even idolize him everything he says
[1:42:59] even if it's wrong why don't you stand
[1:43:01] on TV or on the TV to speak oh they just
[1:43:03] love that person they'll they've got so
[1:43:06] much confidence therefore why they are
[1:43:08] especially at the beginning they started
[1:43:10] to love that person and then love
[1:43:13] developed to a point where by they've
[1:43:15] got confidence every advice he says
[1:43:18] until you are on the screen or on huge
[1:43:20] wherever they take because they love you
[1:43:23] huh the husband and the wife have
[1:43:26] confidence in one another so much
[1:43:28] because that is an incentive of love
[1:43:31] can you see you cannot love so someone
[1:43:35] so much and do things for them give them
[1:43:39] your life
[1:43:41] but they can look after you javelina
[1:43:44] brother still is the one when they don't
[1:43:48] love you no no his love has been
[1:43:52] faithful
[1:43:53] then everything then everything and
[1:43:56] everything gets added and to eat that is
[1:43:59] why I made you turn this 22 verse 37 and
[1:44:03] you see there brother - I met you 22
[1:44:06] verse 20 verse 37 when they attempted
[1:44:09] the Lord Matthew Matthew 22 they asked
[1:44:20] the Lord they ask you a question
[1:44:24] are we there these are said unto Him
[1:44:28] okay that's a verse before peacefully
[1:44:31] master which is the Great Commandment in
[1:44:34] the law jesus said unto them thou shalt
[1:44:37] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:44:39] with all thy soul with all thy mind it's
[1:44:43] leaving nothing there I'm seeing body
[1:44:48] spirit and soul with everything you must
[1:44:54] love him with every thing from the
[1:44:58] inside outside from the outside inside
[1:45:01] everything must love the Lord he said
[1:45:04] that is the best that is the biggest
[1:45:06] commandment this is the first and Great
[1:45:09] Commandment he says and the second the
[1:45:13] second one is it's like entreat thou
[1:45:19] shalt love thy neighbor as yourself
[1:45:22] just pause and think of only a
[1:45:25] kernel-level
[1:45:26] testimony only kernel-level brother
[1:45:28] Mario is it possible to love someone
[1:45:34] like yourself in the world this come on
[1:45:39] be reasonable
[1:45:39] no no there's no reasonable that's what
[1:45:42] the Bible means you must love your your
[1:45:45] neighbor it does not even say your
[1:45:47] brother but neighbor induce your brother
[1:45:51] also huh your neighbor the wildness
[1:45:54] taking drugs that one who is the
[1:45:57] prostitute but what I must love him so
[1:46:02] much is the lady next door to us we were
[1:46:05] praying for him
[1:46:06] she says she's sick but we have seen
[1:46:07] these certain things that are not right
[1:46:09] that is the one that the Lord says you
[1:46:11] must because love will redeem him love
[1:46:15] knows that the one that Jesus Christ
[1:46:17] came to this earth to die for the Bible
[1:46:21] says for God so loved the world not this
[1:46:24] planet with the mountains and everything
[1:46:27] and the rivers know the world people
[1:46:30] that are in the world God loved those
[1:46:32] ones but he came to die for them
[1:46:36] so me because I've got Christ in me me
[1:46:40] and class I won I am supposed to love
[1:46:42] that one to love him to a point where I
[1:46:45] cannot help it correctly when I'm at
[1:46:47] school but to say my friend you know
[1:46:50] Jesus Christ see Jesus Christ he said
[1:46:53] have you ever heard of Jesus Christ I
[1:46:54] can hear you're telling me about this
[1:46:56] disease but I don't watch TV but I want
[1:46:58] to tell you about Jesus have you ever
[1:47:01] heard about him this is me now Karen at
[1:47:04] school talking Leuven say hey my friend
[1:47:06] that's wonderful you are telling me
[1:47:08] about that man I love that be we must go
[1:47:11] play together but just one did you ever
[1:47:13] hear about the man called Jesus this is
[1:47:17] what they teach them how to criticize
[1:47:21] and to dispel the message but our
[1:47:23] children need to get to a point where
[1:47:25] they tell the world about God until
[1:47:28] those children hate them or accept the
[1:47:32] way so that if that is too hard but no
[1:47:37] one will prevent a discussion between
[1:47:39] you and your friend we are not standing
[1:47:42] in front of the whole school and wanting
[1:47:44] to convert the whole school you are
[1:47:45] talking to your friend your school your
[1:47:47] friend must know very clear that when I
[1:47:49] play with Joshua when I won't play with
[1:47:52] Jaden and mo when I wouldn't play with

[1:49:47] ways with his doing things but he came
[1:49:50] for prayer and the world a lot planted
[1:49:53] is seat there if he does not repent or
[1:49:57] accept the Lord one day you will meet
[1:49:59] him in judgment that's all we need to do
[1:50:01] the big unbelievers don't have to accept
[1:50:04] what you say it's cool I'm talking to
[1:50:06] the young ones now they don't have to
[1:50:08] accept it all you need to do is to tell
[1:50:10] them about Jesus tell them about the
[1:50:12] love of Jesus tell them what God has
[1:50:14] done for you
[1:50:15] during the lockdown that you got
[1:50:17] baptized and the one blessed you with
[1:50:19] the Holy Spirit
[1:50:20] that's all you need to do and they say I
[1:50:22] know no no only persons okay but I've
[1:50:23] told you then you pass on that's all you
[1:50:26] need to do my dear isn't it on a list
[1:50:28] I mean yes we read Matthew 22 this is
[1:50:33] it's just about the law of love the law
[1:50:37] of love the law of love the products is
[1:50:41] not I'm not talking about a couple I'm
[1:50:42] not talking about feeling sorry I'm not
[1:50:45] talking about video if you love your
[1:50:46] spouse you express it and you laugh go
[1:50:49] to express but you love God you express
[1:50:52] it if you look for you I want you to see
[1:50:54] if you love your spouse you express it
[1:50:57] right the same way if you love God you
[1:51:00] must express it otherwise you don't love
[1:51:04] it I'm sorry the Lord if you can express
[1:51:08] it I mean how can you have faith with
[1:51:11] your wife if you don't love her that is
[1:51:13] figlio this what I'm talking about takes
[1:51:17] place even at pillow level where we've
[1:51:20] got confidence
[1:51:21] you know a Brahmin knows that our ending
[1:51:23] my man if he's got that he's you know
[1:51:25] did she knows she's got confidence in
[1:51:27] him
[1:51:27] my wife's got confidence in me but I
[1:51:31] know if you do that he's determined to
[1:51:32] do it she's got confidence in me but if
[1:51:35] he says let's pray it's time to pray
[1:51:37] she's got that confidence so if that
[1:51:40] happens it can a level how much more
[1:51:43] power confidence to the Lord
[1:51:45] huh how much more let's let's just
[1:51:49] follow this little bit this love this
[1:51:51] love love this love love love makes him
[1:51:56] believe it because love dominates all
[1:52:01] love is the center of everything that
[1:52:04] you are talking about here love is the
[1:52:07] one that will bring us to desperation
[1:52:09] love is the one that will make us have
[1:52:12] trust and faith in God love is the one
[1:52:15] that will make us to pray love is the
[1:52:17] one that will make us realize that the
[1:52:19] end is here love everything the love of
[1:52:22] God because the purpose is God Himself
[1:52:26] is love God is love the Prophet sees
[1:52:29] love dominates all course God is love
[1:52:33] we do to God that's what that's the way
[1:52:36] we do to God
[1:52:37] we when we love him we tell him about we
[1:52:42] sat down and we adore him and we worship
[1:52:45] Him and see love drives us to depth it
[1:52:49] is love that drives us to do that it's
[1:52:51] not ourselves right so it brings us to a
[1:52:56] state of worship prayerful life better
[1:52:58] and some heartfelt type of a lives if we
[1:53:02] love Lord Jesus amen
[1:53:04] are we together I must finish key point
[1:53:07] remember the summers at key learning
[1:53:09] point key point same message of
[1:53:14] desperation I want to bring that this
[1:53:19] link between prayer in desperation right
[1:53:21] I want to bring this the joining between
[1:53:25] prayer and to be an being desperate the
[1:53:29] effectual fervent just desperation right
[1:53:32] effectual fervent just desperation in
[1:53:36] actual faith and prayer of a righteous
[1:53:38] man availeth March when a righteous man
[1:53:41] a good man gasps in travail our soul
[1:53:45] southern travail either one I think that
[1:53:49] is best is a better wait travail or
[1:53:51] travel in the one which one you want to
[1:53:54] call it but when when is so when a soul
[1:53:58] not the outside when the soul gets in
[1:54:02] desperation and travailing an effectual
[1:54:05] fervent prayer of the man that can show
[1:54:07] the token it does something when you get
[1:54:11] revealed that's another word you cannot
[1:54:14] think of a meaningful producing prayer
[1:54:17] without being travailed
[1:54:19] you cannot how can you do that otherwise
[1:54:22] you're just you're telling God just your
[1:54:24] general feelings which is wonderful it's
[1:54:27] time for that to do that that's time for
[1:54:29] that yes no but he's what I'm talking
[1:54:31] about the prayer in secret in private
[1:54:33] where you and God are talking to one
[1:54:36] another
[1:54:37] I'm almost done if you look at the
[1:54:39] different examples of people but you
[1:54:44] know that
[1:54:45] played he's kind of play that we are
[1:54:48] talking about you think of Aaliyah's of
[1:54:49] Damascus who knows the layers of
[1:54:51] Damascus he was in a situation where he
[1:54:55] has to go find a wife and they trust me
[1:54:58] a good wife the Prophet says in the hour
[1:55:02] of his desperation when he arrived at
[1:55:04] the city he prayed and said Lord that is
[1:55:08] the thing when you get to the
[1:55:09] desperation you go to praying the Lord
[1:55:12] not God let me let the first mate that
[1:55:16] comes forth and what does the came in
[1:55:18] and it gives me the drink be that he
[1:55:20] prayed in the hour of his desperation
[1:55:22] that's what Eliezer did Hanna the mother
[1:55:25] of some will same spoken week and she
[1:55:29] fasted and she prayed until even the
[1:55:32] peace in the tunnel thought she was
[1:55:34] drunk this all she was drunk
[1:55:36] the priest because she was in a state of
[1:55:41] desperation take up the Prince he was in
[1:55:47] a serious desperation was he you that if
[1:55:50] you call that Brooke he's a dead man
[1:55:53] Esau was waiting for him and men of war
[1:55:56] and men of hunting he was waiting for
[1:55:59] him come he was telling him and Jacob
[1:56:03] was under desperation he you know I
[1:56:07] never thought that a man can be so
[1:56:09] desperate that he just allow everything
[1:56:11] his wife and children to go fast but
[1:56:14] there's not one to die huh he was
[1:56:16] desperate
[1:56:18] well when you get baptized and you
[1:56:23] receive the Holy Spirit you are at
[1:56:25] Pentecost am i right tentacles they
[1:56:28] received the Holy Ghost MRI they
[1:56:30] received the Holy Spirit and and and
[1:56:33] they spoke in tongues they did all sorts
[1:56:35] of things because of Pentecost
[1:56:37] it was Pentecost H you have not arrived
[1:56:41] my mind you have not alive that is just
[1:56:45] your birthright
[1:56:46] you receive the Holy Ghost you have not
[1:56:49] arrived in fact you have just at it
[1:56:53] that's what the Prophet caesium just
[1:56:55] like Jacob when he received the best
[1:56:57] right after cheating his planner he
[1:57:00] thought he was over it was not over it
[1:57:03] was only the start it was only the start
[1:57:05] he thought I'm gone when I was looking
[1:57:08] for he thought he got it honey when he
[1:57:12] got the soup and he ate and he left he
[1:57:15] thought oh I'm the man I've got I'm
[1:57:18] bigger than my brother now that was only
[1:57:20] the beginning for Jacob that was not the
[1:57:23] end and that's me and you when we get
[1:57:25] baptized and we get the holy spirit and
[1:57:27] we jump in the story and we are so
[1:57:28] excited
[1:57:29] mmm that's only the beginning my brother
[1:57:31] my sister that is needed that is one tip
[1:57:35] that is that is what we want that is the
[1:57:37] beginning right sister Debbie am i right
[1:57:40] my girl that is only the beginning the
[1:57:42] Prophet says just like Jacob here is in
[1:57:44] his birthright after a day a deal Nate
[1:57:47] no sorry this is me not the Prophet just
[1:57:49] like Joe Kopp received a bet right after
[1:57:51] the deal made with his brother yes he
[1:57:53] received it but that is just a beginning
[1:57:56] very often we make a mistake thinking
[1:57:58] that we have arrived when we received
[1:58:01] the Holy Spirit we have just started the
[1:58:03] Prophet says amen
[1:58:05] it takes desperation to bring God to the
[1:58:07] sin it takes desperation amen let me
[1:58:11] read for you in closing the following
[1:58:13] quotations about prayer for the Prophet
[1:58:15] says believe in God 19:52 Oh 2:24 Christ
[1:58:20] gave us the authority with his name by
[1:58:22] being Christians the most powerful
[1:58:24] weapon the world has ever known
[1:58:26] prayer that's the most powerful air do
[1:58:32] we believe that expectation 90-61
[1:58:35] there is no atomic bomb and no hydrogen
[1:58:39] bomb as powerful as prayer do you know
[1:58:44] an atomic bomb no one the hiroshima one
[1:58:49] is that was an atomic you know what that
[1:58:52] bomb up to this day I believe there's
[1:58:54] still people who were affected by that
[1:58:57] Jesus your prayer your sincere prayer
[1:59:02] the one that you dedicate and you get to
[1:59:05] pair with God he
[1:59:06] your secret place that is not a hummock
[1:59:09] bomb or hydrogen bomb that is more
[1:59:11] powerful than that player and it's not
[1:59:16] saying what I say a prayer for the child
[1:59:18] or a prayer for a sick man or a prayer
[1:59:22] for a madman this is a sincere prayer
[1:59:25] but it's why that men on the cross what
[1:59:30] he said I believe it was a prayer from
[1:59:33] his heart is that you Lord remember me
[1:59:37] that was a pea from deep inside and
[1:59:41] they're not connected with it quickly he
[1:59:43] said you will be with me answers
[1:59:46] when you can't desperately you know that
[1:59:51] man just just just made it because he
[1:59:56] was at the end of the end and by the
[2:00:01] grace of God because if you are a city
[2:00:03] of God there's no way you can make you
[2:00:04] will make it but appreciate what you are
[2:00:07] going through and what the Lord wants
[2:00:09] you to go through am i right and I got
[2:00:13] spoken with let us see Jesus 1959 don't
[2:00:16] pray for yourself pray for somebody else
[2:00:19] God he has prayer he knows what you are
[2:00:22] what you are praying about so you need
[2:00:25] to pray for somebody be desperate for
[2:00:27] somebody and you will see in that
[2:00:29] process God is going to give you that
[2:00:33] you need it so under four it's not easy
[2:00:35] not easy but it's so it's so it's so
[2:00:38] fulfilling to get into somebody's
[2:00:40] bedroom you know what it does you make
[2:00:42] it you're one you own it as if it's your
[2:00:47] problem mr. Sisco used to ask us a
[2:00:50] question every time we discussed and we
[2:00:53] talk about somebody is pure they are
[2:00:55] just a cheap a problem poor does tell me
[2:00:57] just imagine if it was in the top you
[2:01:00] know she brings it home now imagine just
[2:01:03] imagine if it was sister Nadine Brooke
[2:01:05] what will you do what will you do if it
[2:01:08] was brother James okay
[2:01:10] his problem for his brother that one but
[2:01:13] if it was to a hobby what was going to
[2:01:16] be worried if it was my wife Sita said
[2:01:18] what was going to be my action
[2:01:20] you see so when I pray along those lines
[2:01:23] when I pray as if my brother's problem
[2:01:25] is mine when I own it I feel the pain
[2:01:28] I'm fulfilling what the Lord is doing
[2:01:31] you got the Lord is touched by the
[2:01:33] feeling he would not come here if he
[2:01:36] didn't know did you know how old Phil
[2:01:39] and he said ah let me go and even feel
[2:01:41] it myself
[2:01:42] and he came a man God projecting Islam
[2:01:47] in closing if ever I had a time of
[2:01:50] success of praying for anyone is when I
[2:01:53] could enter into the fellowship with
[2:01:55] them that's what I've just said Phil the
[2:01:57] Eternity affinities fill their
[2:01:59] conditions that's what the Prophet says
[2:02:02] it's not me my brother's this one I'm
[2:02:04] about to read now is for us preachers
[2:02:07] anyone who's a minister
[2:02:09] this one says brother Ben I remember the
[2:02:11] James Randi Isaac this one is for us he
[2:02:14] says how a minister ought to always get
[2:02:17] alone to himself even before PPG's
[2:02:21] before he prays before he does anything
[2:02:24] he should get alone with God in that
[2:02:27] quiet place heat away with God and talk
[2:02:35] to God amen before you come to the
[2:02:38] secret place amen 1963 1226 do your
[2:02:43] praying secrets stay out of place and
[2:02:46] and go into your rooms hide out
[2:02:49] somewhere and just kneel down
[2:02:52] just stay before God and stay there
[2:02:54] that's what the Prophet says 1963
[2:02:57] transics again the main thing now your
[2:02:59] prayer is to be in secret everything is
[2:03:03] that I'm reading is about prayer your
[2:03:05] main long prayer they all pray all enter
[2:03:09] into the secret closet
[2:03:11] close the door thus there is where you
[2:03:14] want to play all day all night
[2:03:16] or two hours pray day that's when you
[2:03:20] want to pray that's when you want to
[2:03:21] communicate
[2:03:22] hallelujah any time the devil wants to
[2:03:25] gobble you up he's got you under his
[2:03:29] control when he calls your prayer life
[2:03:31] when the devil comes your prayer life
[2:03:34] brother you're gone you're gone so it's
[2:03:40] so important for us to understand that
[2:03:43] we cannot just wish you Ashley
[2:03:45] pray it's important for us to understand
[2:03:48] that when we pray to God we need to pray
[2:03:50] with the purpose we need to pray with
[2:03:54] the meaning we need to pray with a cry
[2:03:57] we need to Kerr to pray and worship Him
[2:03:59] in prayer tell him how great he is tell
[2:04:02] him how life how much we love him I mean
[2:04:07] may God bless you God gave us authority
[2:04:12] with his name by being Christians the
[2:04:14] most powerful weapon the world has ever
[2:04:17] had is prayer let us take that burden of
[2:04:21] prayer with us let us inculcate it into
[2:04:24] our families let us build it to a point
[2:04:28] where the devil because that's powerful
[2:04:31] than the atomic bomb powerful than any
[2:04:34] weapon that prayer that burden of Prayer
[2:04:37] it moves resting on our feet
[2:04:41] amen may God bless you all
[2:04:45] I trust and I believe that with these
[2:04:49] unorganized weights the Lord has blessed
[2:04:50] you and that the Lord has spoken to your
[2:04:53] hearts if I spoken anything that he
[2:04:56] didn't he ate very well probably because
[2:04:58] of this polarization or maybe I'm
[2:05:01] speaking so fast but the Lord the Holy
[2:05:03] Spirit whom you have invited him he will
[2:05:06] put it right in your heart in your life
