[39:03] we're going to read one scripture
[39:06] in uh second corinthians 5 and verse 21
[39:10] and what a song
[39:13] praise god
[39:16] you know
[39:18] jesus was when he was in his glorified
[39:21] form he had still had the
[39:23] scars or the holes in his hands and his
[39:25] feet though it didn't bother him none
[39:28] and i just wonder i might be wrong i
[39:29] might be right i don't know we'll find
[39:31] out though
[39:32] one day when we're over there and time
[39:33] is no more
[39:35] and we we're fellowshipping somewhere
[39:37] for a million gazillion years
[39:39] and then we go up to the great city
[39:40] where we live and we go see our king
[39:44] maybe he'll just raise your hand and
[39:45] wave
[39:46] or see a nail print

[39:58] amen
[40:01] i trust tonight
[40:04] that
[40:06] i say if that song didn't move you
[40:09] you should talk to the lord about it
[40:11] it should move you
[40:17] second corinthians 5 and 21.
[40:27] for he hath made him
[40:29] to be sin for us
[40:30] who knew no sin
[40:33] that we might be made the righteousness
[40:36] of god in him
[40:41] may lord bless the reading of his word
[40:42] you may have your seats tonight i'm not
[40:44] going to be very long
[40:48] but we
[40:49] have
[40:50] if you think about the great
[40:53] exchange
[40:55] i remember brother moses where are
[40:57] brothers brother moses china when we
[40:59] were there at the family camp there in
[41:01] taranaki and he was preaching and he and
[41:03] he preached a service on gethsemane
[41:06] and and he was dramatizing and taking
[41:08] things where brother branham was
[41:09] dramatizing it and and he said that
[41:12] while jesus was there in gethsemane
[41:15] everyone was waiting for an answer
[41:18] heaven was waiting for an answer the
[41:20] angels were waiting
[41:22] now because they're waiting because all
[41:24] of creation hinged on one man
[41:27] no one else would come and pay the price
[41:29] no one else could do the job one man
[41:31] could do the job
[41:33] there was not a this was this is not a
[41:35] trial run in the real this was the for
[41:36] real life
[41:38] this was the one moment
[41:40] and all of heaven he was there agonizing
[41:42] under prayer the bible says that
[41:45] his bloods fell like sweat down his face
[41:47] because of the agony because he knew
[41:49] what he had to go through
[41:51] he wasn't walking blindly
[41:54] when he was there and the next few
[41:55] moments of his last of his mortal life
[41:58] he knew the anguish he knew the
[42:00] suffering he had stood there on mount
[42:02] transfiguration and moses and elijah had
[42:04] preached to him about what he had to
[42:06] accomplish in jerusalem he knew full
[42:08] well what he had to go through you know
[42:11] i trust you knew one day what it was
[42:12] like to have a burden of sin
[42:15] who remembered that day the grievous
[42:18] burden of sin that was upon your life
[42:21] but i'm trust you know the joy of when
[42:23] you lay that all down at his feet
[42:25] that you don't carry that burden anymore
[42:28] but if you take that and then you times
[42:30] it by i don't know how many billion
[42:32] souls that have been upon the face of
[42:34] the earth
[42:35] he was carrying all of that
[42:37] because he was our sin offering
[42:39] he was our passover lamb the wrath of
[42:42] god was god's law was satisfied
[42:46] that day on calvary
[42:48] there had to be a penalty paid a price
[42:51] paid no one else could pay the price he
[42:54] was mother more than any other man
[42:56] he was wounded for our transgressions
[42:58] the chastisement of peace was upon him
[43:00] and by his stripes we are healed he was
[43:03] bruised for our inequities
[43:04] hallelujah he there he was
[43:08] and he was agonizing in prayer and
[43:10] heaven was waiting for an answer will he
[43:13] or will he not he had a choice
[43:16] the lord jesus was no robot just like
[43:18] we're not a robot we've got to make a
[43:20] choice
[43:21] and you can either make a choice now i'm
[43:24] so glad we can make a choice now i'm so
[43:26] glad we can say yes to eternal life
[43:28] i mean that we can you know we still
[43:30] have life in these bodies i believe
[43:32] we're insane mind and we can accept
[43:34] eternal life tonight so heaven was
[43:36] waiting for the answer
[43:38] and then finally
[43:41] he i don't know how he would have voiced
[43:43] it but i doubt it was would have been a
[43:45] very agonizing way father if you be
[43:47] willing
[43:48] take this cup from me
[43:51] but then the next part but nevertheless
[43:54] not my will but thy will be done
[43:57] a yes
[43:58] went through up into heaven
[44:00] hallelujah
[44:02] now waiting for an answer
[44:04] and he said yes
[44:06] hallelujah
[44:07] and he went his hour he was done before
[44:09] his accusers the lamb for the slaughter
[44:11] and the wrath of god was put out upon
[44:13] him that day on calvary
[44:15] for you and i
[44:17] he became sin
[44:19] that we who knew no sin that we might be
[44:22] made the righteousness of god in him
[44:29] we're here tonight
[44:30] to remember the lord's death burial and
[44:34] resurrection the past last moments of
[44:37] his life were not an easy moment
[44:40] but they were the most joyous
[44:42] because he had a joy set before him
[44:45] that was you and i
[44:47] redeemed
[44:49] i trust heaven's real to you
[44:51] i trust brother brown would sing let us
[44:53] look beyond the curtain of time he says
[44:55] lord let them look as he's singing that
[44:57] he says lord let them look beyond the
[44:59] curtain of time
[45:00] and i trust you've had a glimpse
[45:03] either by even just as a spirit coming
[45:05] upon your life
[45:06] or he opens his word to you more than a
[45:09] human can but god takes his word and
[45:11] anchors it in your soul and you can't
[45:13] get rid of it not that you'd want to the
[45:15] devil can't get rid of it it's a
[45:16] revelation it's deposited that you don't
[45:19] belong on this terra firma you don't
[45:22] belong in this culture you don't belong
[45:24] in this world i mean you belong in a
[45:26] different world
[45:28] i heard a preacher say i can't remember
[45:30] who it was but you know this this world
[45:33] is the closest
[45:35] that the believer will ever get to hell
[45:39] because hell is upon the earth
[45:41] this is the closest we will ever get
[45:43] because we don't have to go to hell
[45:45] because jesus as a sinner took our place
[45:48] he stepped out of the portals of glory
[45:50] said i'm going to redeem adam's fallen
[45:52] race hallelujah and by his great love he
[45:54] chose you before the foundation of the
[45:56] world he ain't going to lose one
[45:59] there won't be one seat at the marriage
[46:01] supper table that will be empty and
[46:03] we'll have to ask the question what
[46:04] happened to that brother or that sister
[46:06] no there won't be that they will all be
[46:07] there
[46:08] you say well it's all rigged it's rigged
[46:10] but god has given you a choice i'd
[46:13] rather cast my vote brother braham said
[46:15] that the devil voted against me god
[46:17] voted for me but depends where you cast
[46:19] your vote
[46:21] i would i would vote with god
[46:23] if god voted for me i'm going to vote
[46:25] for her i'm going to vote in that in
[46:26] that direction
[46:29] but here you know
[46:31] this is the closest that believe will
[46:33] ever get to hell
[46:36] but for some people out of their own
[46:37] choice this is the closest they'll ever
[46:39] get to heaven
[46:42] i don't want to be that kind of person
[46:44] that's why i see before i'm so glad we
[46:46] have choice
[46:47] we can make up our mind we can sell out
[46:49] to god we can say lord take my life make
[46:52] it thine not my will but thy will be
[46:54] done irrespective of what we've done our
[46:56] pastors are relevant to god he doesn't
[46:59] care where you came from he looked
[47:00] beyond the works of your natural flesh
[47:03] he saw a gene seed of predestination
[47:05] that's why he called you and that's why
[47:07] he gathered you to himself
[47:10] hallelujah
[47:14] adam
[47:15] because of the transgression the apostle
[47:17] paul would say that through adam
[47:20] all die
[47:22] even so in christ
[47:24] shall all be made alive
[47:27] so
[47:28] because of adam
[47:30] we know through love he tried to redeem
[47:33] eve but couldn't do it and they fell man
[47:35] fell
[47:36] but because of what happened there in
[47:38] the garden
[47:39] we are now under a curse of sin
[47:43] until
[47:45] it's not a forever
[47:46] for the believer it's in until
[47:48] until jesus comes
[47:50] to you i'm not talking about uh coming
[47:52] the coming of the lord but i'm talking
[47:54] about when he came to you
[47:56] the prophet said about the woman at the
[47:58] well
[47:59] he said that when she spoke to the lord
[48:02] and he said i'm messiah he said the
[48:05] light of the word struck her soul and
[48:07] brought it to life
[48:09] and the reason that it happened is
[48:11] because she had representation in heaven
[48:13] she had a theophany in heaven that's why
[48:16] when the word came up
[48:17] across her path not religion she was
[48:19] full of religion she said our fathers
[48:22] worship here and jacob dug this well and
[48:25] she could tell explain all those kind of
[48:27] things but here was the one who had the
[48:29] water that you drink and thirst no more
[48:31] you know a lot of people are thirsty and
[48:33] they try and and they try and bury that
[48:36] thirst and drugs or women or men or
[48:38] computers or movies or whatever they try
[48:41] and people are just thirsty but they
[48:42] just come to the fountain
[48:44] of eternal life and drink of this water
[48:47] amen you won't thirst no more your life
[48:49] will be changed and i'm so glad
[48:52] i'm so glad the fountain's here
[48:55] he's here for you he's not just here
[48:57] he's here for you all of you you all of
[48:59] you all of us
[49:00] he's here for us
[49:02] amen
[49:04] so under adam we all die
[49:06] even so in christ shall all be made
[49:09] alive that's first corinthians 15 and
[49:11] and 22.
[49:14] so
[49:15] by the transgression of adam we are we
[49:18] are under the curse of sin
[49:21] until
[49:22] jesus came
[49:24] the woman of the well was under the
[49:25] curse of sin
[49:27] until she met messiah by a well amen as
[49:30] i said because
[49:31] she had pre she had representation in
[49:33] heaven when she heard that word her her
[49:36] soul came alive that seed that was
[49:38] dormant under all this concrete of man's
[49:40] ideas and broken marriages and broken
[49:43] relationships and they just all burst
[49:46] they just all turned to powder and
[49:47] floated away because the sunlight passed
[49:50] through it and brought it to life
[49:52] hallelujah
[49:54] and that's what's got so because of that
[49:57] josh you're still in a natural body but
[49:59] she wasn't under the curse
[50:01] of adam anymore
[50:02] the lord had redeemed her
[50:04] it's the same thing with you and i
[50:08] he came
[50:09] to ignite your life to live in your life
[50:12] to shake this world to make your living
[50:14] bible i mean to make you in his image
[50:17] hallelujah to mold you and shape you
[50:19] into his word amen that you can you
[50:21] think about you you think about the
[50:23] mighty men of valor there in the old
[50:24] testament killing hundreds of
[50:26] philistines and different ones and you
[50:28] know that's nothing compared to the real
[50:30] warriors of god that i'm looking at here
[50:33] in this building doesn't matter how
[50:35] young you are i mean there's demon
[50:37] spirits they fought a natural enemy we
[50:39] fight a real spiritual enemy and we need
[50:41] to be able to discern between his
[50:43] anointing and the anointing of god his
[50:46] anointing will always put question marks
[50:49] on the word we'll put question marks on
[50:51] who you are we'll put question marks on
[50:53] your salvation we'll put question marks
[50:55] on is this real is it not and you'll
[50:57] fill your mind with everything else but
[50:59] the lord
[51:00] you've got to be able to discern
[51:02] amen amen but the lord will just draw
[51:05] you to himself there'll be a pull
[51:07] amen after you've been in this you know
[51:09] you know it's like that sweet feeling
[51:11] comes over you
[51:12] and you feel so small and humble
[51:15] brother baby says there's angels coming
[51:17] round
[51:18] hallelujah that's the lord drawing
[51:20] close and all of us i trust if you've i
[51:24] trust you've had those kind of
[51:25] experiences in your life you don't want
[51:27] to step out of that
[51:29] you know what that is brother ram says
[51:31] it's you're actually your theophany
[51:32] bumping into you
[51:34] it's eternity bumping into you
[51:36] and it bumps into you and it bumps into
[51:38] you and eventually it's not just going
[51:40] to bump it's going to grab and carry you
[51:42] away
[51:43] because you and it are going to become
[51:45] one
[51:46] hallelujah
[51:48] this is not a fantasy story this is not
[51:50] something off netflix or tick tock or
[51:53] place your social media nonsense here
[51:55] this is reality
[51:56] you know people want to live in a
[51:58] fantasy world in this day there's all
[52:00] kind of escapism all kinds of things
[52:03] people watch and do and they you know
[52:05] cosplay they dress up as their
[52:07] superheroes and whatever more and you
[52:09] know that's just a that's just a
[52:12] a perversion
[52:14] of what god wants to make us we're more
[52:16] than superheroes
[52:18] we're more than people with powers and a
[52:20] troubled past
[52:22] that's not what this is about no god
[52:23] doesn't just keep our troubled past
[52:25] there and you know try no he takes care
[52:28] of it his blood washes that away and he
[52:31] fills us with his own spirit
[52:33] that whenever the enemy comes against
[52:35] you you can deal with them
[52:37] you can cast them out you can have
[52:39] victory you can live an overcoming life
[52:42] so
[52:43] we will once once upon a time
[52:46] under the curse that because of adam
[52:49] but now if you're a believer you're
[52:52] under the blessings of jesus christ
[52:56] whatever god is blessed
[52:58] is blessed sure we may we may backslide
[53:01] we may step out of line god will deal
[53:03] with us he'll bring us back
[53:06] but
[53:07] as long as we're his son or daughter
[53:09] that's the main thing as long as we're
[53:11] his child he's going to get us back on
[53:13] the road
[53:15] hallelujah
[53:17] so we're now under
[53:20] the blessings
[53:22] of being in christ
[53:29] brother brahm says this here
[53:31] in the position of a believer in christ
[53:33] i won't be too much longer and jesus not
[53:35] ignorant of what he was doing came down
[53:38] and he took his place with the sinner
[53:40] the church that he might redeem the
[53:42] church back to himself see i said it was
[53:45] a type adam was uh christ is the second
[53:47] adam where through the first adam all
[53:50] die through the second adam all live
[53:54] so
[53:55] and he says is in christ the mystery god
[53:56] revealed notice then one like the first
[53:59] adam and eve before sin separated them
[54:01] in death now christ the second adam in
[54:04] life redeems his bride from death and
[54:07] now on his way back to the original eden
[54:11] restoring back his bride and fellowship
[54:14] back with god
[54:15] as husband and wife in the garden of
[54:17] eden christ
[54:19] and his bride
[54:21] so we he's redeemed us from death you
[54:23] think you know people make it doesn't
[54:25] well people make all things out of
[54:27] communion
[54:28] but really it's a symbol it's actually
[54:30] making a public declaration because
[54:32] there's three ordinances we are told to
[54:33] do
[54:35] communion foot washing water baptism in
[54:37] the name of lord jesus christ right
[54:39] that's the three things that's the three
[54:40] ordinances
[54:42] you're making a public declaration
[54:44] that you and your sacrifice have become
[54:47] one
[54:48] and that you are under the blessings of
[54:51] jesus christ now you've been united to
[54:53] him you're not under the curse of adam
[54:56] and his unbelief in sin
[54:58] hallelujah
[55:00] amen we are a different kind of people
[55:05] he has made you a different kind of a
[55:06] person
[55:08] this is not just religion
[55:10] this is not just a church
[55:12] forget that idea there's not just a
[55:14] movement
[55:15] no this is a part of god's plan of
[55:17] redemption
[55:18] we are part of god's redemption plan you
[55:21] are
[55:22] we are not spectators the woman at the
[55:25] well was not a spectator she was a
[55:27] spectator in a lot of things in life
[55:29] maybe what was going on in the sanhedrin
[55:31] and the temple and different things in
[55:32] her village but in god's mind she was
[55:35] not a spectator in his plan she was the
[55:37] main event
[55:39] she was the apple of his eye she was the
[55:41] one he was looking for and it's the same
[55:44] thing with you and i this great end time
[55:46] that's unfolding in front of us that
[55:48] we're living in where the world is
[55:50] falling apart and brother graham had a
[55:52] vision of of of billy paul when he when
[55:55] he went out and smoking told lies to his
[55:57] father and you know wouldn't you know he
[55:59] he saw him falling and falling
[56:02] jumped out a window falling and laughing
[56:04] and falling and laughing and falling and
[56:06] laughing and the prophet was so caught
[56:09] up in it because he saw this was billy
[56:11] paul's spiritual state
[56:12] he was caught up in the things of the
[56:14] world thinking he was having a great
[56:16] time
[56:17] i thought i was having a great time
[56:20] but then the prophet cried out oh god
[56:23] don't let my son die in this state and
[56:25] then he saw two hands or a hand grab
[56:28] catch him
[56:29] and bring him back up to where he was
[56:31] originally
[56:33] hallelujah i remember i was like to fall
[56:36] and laugh and fall and laugh but i
[56:37] remember what it was like when those big
[56:38] hands
[56:40] of the lord they never dropped one
[56:43] they never dropped one
[56:45] i remember i was like to be caught by
[56:46] them those great hands and he put me on
[56:49] his shoulder
[56:50] carried me into a sheepfold
[56:52] hollywood i'm safe for eternity
[56:56] hallelujah and this world is falling and
[56:59] laughing and falling and laughing
[57:01] thinking it's having a great time it's
[57:02] heading for judgment
[57:04] we don't have to live that kind of life
[57:06] the lord doesn't want you to live that
[57:08] kind of life he wants to catch you
[57:12] but you've got to let them catch you
[57:14] you've got to open your heart for
[57:15] salvation open your heart for
[57:17] deliverance open your heart for healing
[57:19] for redemption whatever it is you open
[57:21] your heart say lord catch me
[57:24] hallelujah so this world is falling
[57:27] apart
[57:29] and that's not a shock to anyone
[57:31] but he has made us in such a way
[57:34] that we won't fall apart with this world
[57:37] i say thanks be to god you think that
[57:40] woman at the well her past was
[57:42] irrelevant
[57:44] to him our past doesn't matter
[57:47] rahabs your god takes care of us
[57:50] in such an amazing way
[57:52] rahab had a past
[57:55] and you know it could have been
[57:58] and and i'm just going to stop with this
[57:59] thought
[58:01] everyone every other israelite woman who
[58:04] is of a eligible marriageable h
[58:07] would have wanted to marry salmon
[58:09] he was of the tribe of judah
[58:13] he was a general in the army this guy
[58:15] was a catch
[58:17] he wasn't just any guy he was the guy
[58:19] he was the whole package
[58:21] but yet god in his great plan
[58:24] didn't didn't allow his heart to rest or
[58:28] his affection to rest upon anyone
[58:30] of israel
[58:32] but one
[58:34] and she wasn't even part of israel
[58:37] she was rahab the harlot
[58:40] hallelujah
[58:41] and i don't know if they did it in those
[58:43] days but you know it used to be a
[58:45] tradition and you know and and weddings
[58:47] in the west that the minister would say
[58:49] if anyone has any reason why these two
[58:51] should not be joined in holy matrimony
[58:53] let them speak now forever hold their
[58:55] peace and just to dramatize it maybe you
[58:57] know there came that point in the
[58:59] ceremony this is all drama but yeah i
[59:01] hope it just makes something a bit alive
[59:02] too you know but you know and then maybe
[59:04] one of those is like woman just couldn't
[59:05] stand it because she should have been
[59:07] standing there at the altar and so she
[59:09] stood up
[59:10] and said excuse me
[59:12] she's a harlot
[59:14] she's rehabbed the harlot
[59:16] and salman could have said hold on hold
[59:18] on
[59:20] if that is the case
[59:22] find one of the men
[59:24] that you did the act with
[59:26] and you could have heard a pin drop in
[59:28] the place because god before before they
[59:31] came together god had annihilated her
[59:34] past it was all dead
[59:37] hallelujah
[59:38] and it's the same thing with you and i
[59:40] that's why we shouldn't be haunted by
[59:42] our past
[59:43] god took care of it when he went to
[59:46] calvary he was taking care of your past
[59:48] and your memories and whatever regret he
[59:50] took care of our regret he took care of
[59:53] our shame he took care of our sin that
[59:55] day on calvary hallelujah and the
[59:58] children of israel without knowing it
[59:59] they took care of rahab's past that no
[1:00:02] one could stand up and say no she's not
[1:00:04] worthy married to this man
[1:00:07] hallelujah because god takes care of it
[1:00:10] and it's the same thing with you and i
[1:00:13] god's taking care of it
[1:00:15] he's taking care of our past he don't
[1:00:17] remember it no more
[1:00:19] hallelujah
[1:00:21] and in his great mind it doesn't even
[1:00:23] exist
[1:00:26] abraham would be told by god
[1:00:29] to take isaac his son his only son
[1:00:32] and go and go offer him on the mountain
[1:00:35] now abraham in the flesh you'd say no
[1:00:39] god you're wrong he has another son and
[1:00:42] that was ishmael
[1:00:44] but ishmael was not abraham's son
[1:00:47] ishmael was abram's son
[1:00:49] but yet if you looked it in the natural
[1:00:53] this guy who's standing here
[1:00:55] is abram no he's abraham
[1:00:59] and when god looked down when god looked
[1:01:01] down at abraham
[1:01:03] everything that abram did in the flesh
[1:01:06] was not attributed to abraham because
[1:01:10] abram died
[1:01:12] same man same body
[1:01:14] but yet he became a new creature because
[1:01:16] we know to change abram to abraham you
[1:01:19] got to put the h in which is the breath
[1:01:22] of god god breathed into him
[1:01:24] and made him a different man he was born
[1:01:27] again we could say in type but when god
[1:01:29] looked down at him he didn't have a past
[1:01:32] though his past could walk up and talk
[1:01:34] to him hi dad how are you
[1:01:37] ishmael could have done that
[1:01:39] but in god's great mind
[1:01:43] he wasn't even attributed to abraham
[1:01:45] because he was abram's son
[1:01:48] that's why we should never ever let our
[1:01:51] past haunt us
[1:01:53] and we should never think well we just
[1:01:54] have to live under the burden
[1:01:57] of what we once did
[1:01:59] because the blood takes care of it
[1:02:01] hallelujah you think about it
[1:02:04] god
[1:02:05] cannot marry
[1:02:07] a woman that's got sin in her life i'm
[1:02:09] talking about the bride of christ he
[1:02:11] can't
[1:02:12] so that's why jesus hung there that
[1:02:15] between heavens and earth that down
[1:02:16] calvary because he wanted not just to
[1:02:18] cover your sin he wasn't interested in
[1:02:20] covering your sin it may be very real in
[1:02:22] your mind
[1:02:24] and i heard brother ron spencer say a
[1:02:25] few years ago god actually allows that
[1:02:27] that you remain thankful
[1:02:29] not not to be a grievous weight but
[1:02:32] you've got to realize i'm not that
[1:02:33] person
[1:02:34] that person died
[1:02:36] he's gone or she's gone i don't know
[1:02:38] what yo i'm not that person anymore he's
[1:02:40] liberated me
[1:02:42] because i'm not under the curse of adam
[1:02:43] i'm under the blessings of jesus christ
[1:02:45] our lord
[1:02:47] hallelujah so
[1:02:50] he became sin for us who knew no sin
[1:02:52] that we might be made the righteous of
[1:02:54] god in him as i said he can't he can't
[1:02:56] unite himself with a with a with a
[1:02:58] believer that's got sinner got that
[1:03:00] sinful nature in their life but the
[1:03:02] blood takes care of it
[1:03:04] and in spite of our failures and
[1:03:07] everything remember if we confess our
[1:03:08] sin he's faithful and just to forgive us
[1:03:10] it says in first john 1 7 but if we walk
[1:03:13] in the light as he is in the light
[1:03:15] amen
[1:03:16] we have fellowship with him and the
[1:03:17] blood of jesus christ and cleanse us
[1:03:19] from all sin
[1:03:20] and the light is the word of the hour
[1:03:23] and then it says if we confess our sins
[1:03:25] faithful and just to forgive us our sin
[1:03:27] so
[1:03:28] the communion
[1:03:31] is a i'm just going to wrap up with
[1:03:33] i know i say that sorry but
[1:03:36] you are showing the world and i probably
[1:03:38] this is probably where i come down to
[1:03:39] every communion service but you think
[1:03:42] about this
[1:03:43] you're showing the world
[1:03:45] he said this is my body which will be
[1:03:46] broken for you
[1:03:48] do this remember it's me this is the new
[1:03:50] testament in my blood
[1:03:51] drink it as off as you remember me
[1:03:53] his body was mad more than any man
[1:03:57] he's going to show love this is love
[1:04:00] he poured his life out
[1:04:02] but where did that life go
[1:04:04] it didn't just bathe the earth and
[1:04:06] stayed there and come to nothing no the
[1:04:08] life in the blood comes into the
[1:04:10] believer
[1:04:11] hallelujah so now we're making a public
[1:04:14] testimony i and my sacrifice have become
[1:04:17] one
[1:04:18] when you see me you see the lamb
[1:04:21] because his life is now in me
[1:04:24] hallelujah it's no longer i that liveth
[1:04:26] in the flesh but christ that liveth in
[1:04:28] me
[1:04:30] amen and because you have i trust by
[1:04:33] faith become one who's become
[1:04:36] he found you somewhere
[1:04:38] he had a reason of doing it
[1:04:40] hallelujah
[1:04:43] he became one with you he chose to do
[1:04:45] that solomon decided or chose to become
[1:04:48] one with rahab and marry her
[1:04:50] hallelujah
[1:04:52] he wasn't ashamed of his wife
[1:04:54] god's not ashamed of you
[1:04:56] he's not ashamed of us he's proud we are
[1:04:59] his victory
[1:05:01] we are his victory he is we are if i can
[1:05:04] put it this way we are his finest
[1:05:07] achievement
[1:05:08] because here is a people who are born
[1:05:10] with a free moral agency
[1:05:13] and their natural birth actually caused
[1:05:15] them not to seek after god but yet god
[1:05:18] deposited something on the inside the
[1:05:20] inside of you before the foundation of
[1:05:22] the world that in your season the other
[1:05:24] hunger would come
[1:05:26] or even from a little child i mean being
[1:05:28] 11 years old i wanted the jesus to live
[1:05:30] in my heart
[1:05:32] no no i had no idea where to find him
[1:05:34] but there was something in me crying out
[1:05:37] and in god's season
[1:05:39] he said i'm not just going to leave you
[1:05:41] with the cry i'm going to fill the
[1:05:43] answer the cry
[1:05:44] hallelujah
[1:05:48] amen so
[1:05:51] we are now
[1:05:53] i trust you are
[1:05:55] beneficiaries
[1:05:57] of his death
[1:05:58] of his burial
[1:06:00] and his resurrection
[1:06:02] he chose you just be happy about that
[1:06:05] your ups and your downs you know
[1:06:07] he doesn't beat us up because we go down
[1:06:10] oh we you know we have our
[1:06:12] wobble us out yeah we get the speed
[1:06:14] wobbles whatever you want to call it our
[1:06:16] god has chosen us he can't change his
[1:06:18] mind
[1:06:20] and so we can say thank you lord
[1:06:23] that heaven has touched me
[1:06:26] because i have a representation in
[1:06:28] heaven
[1:06:29] and this is showing so i'm now making
[1:06:31] gonna make a public declaration
[1:06:34] that you and i have become one
[1:06:37] by your spirit that dwells in me
[1:06:40] don't you love him
[1:06:42] this evening
[1:06:43] isn't he wonderful
[1:06:47] he became sin for us
[1:06:51] who knew no sin
[1:06:52] that we might become
[1:06:54] the be made the righteousness of god in
[1:06:57] him
[1:06:58] or i'll say it this way he hath been
[1:07:01] made sin for me
[1:07:03] who knew no sin
[1:07:05] that i might be made the righteousness
[1:07:07] of god in him
[1:07:15] let's bow here to the word of prayer
[1:07:18] and then we'll and then we'll read first
[1:07:20] corinthians 11.

[1:08:36] price lord we don't have to buy it
