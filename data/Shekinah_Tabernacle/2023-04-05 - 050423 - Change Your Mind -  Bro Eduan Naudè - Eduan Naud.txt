Friday Lord and as we as we read through your word we see that it was maybe not a good Friday for your disciples and what they saw what they had to endure what you had to endure but it was a good Friday Lord because before the foundations of the world you've ordained this to go down into hell and grab those keys Lord and just release us from anything on this side of the veil that will try and keep us away from you you are all in all you are our full stop you are the period the constant in our lives Lord May You Take Over Control now of the service of these lips Lord that's worshiping you

Malachi 3 and verse 6. and if you're all there you can say Amen it reads for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed may the Lord add the blessing to his word you may have your seats so it's such a wonderful atmosphere now I've got a really simple thought tonight of nothing nothing new um I'll just grab my notes here so I'll start off with that one yes Colossians 2 as he therefore receives Christ Jesus the Lord so walk you with him rooted in Baltimore built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving it is such a marvelous time to to be alive um if we can grasp um in our age where we are so far down the track and if you can still keep going if you can still be walking and still have and we'll get to it now oh man I just want to jump for it okay firstly I'm going to welcome Heinz van amarva now this is incredible I think the Lord just blessed me I walked in here and saw this familiar face I don't think he remembers me um we've made I think you say 2008 so let's say 2008 2010 so this was before I was here and um we meet in one of the churches and the promise Keepers events and all that and I remember his his uh South African rugby Jersey is sharks Jersey so immediately we connected because I'm a bull and he's a shark so we didn't we had something to talk about and we've got three state there in the back praise the Lord that God's just released us from that day oh my if I can throw up photos here of of those bull horns and painted all them blue and just shouting out then the next day ironically at church you don't have a voice because you just screamed it all away for what I don't know for entertainment a few you know 30 boys you know they say they 28 but I think they're just boys kicking the ball around so anyway this is not in my notes I'm so sorry but let's let's move on well I say it's not on my notes the Lord's got it in control when when I when I saw Heinz this this evening and I thought quickly back I had this glance of my life and go oh I was not the man that I used to be I'm not the man that I ought to be so but as long as I'm walking and that's what I'm saying if you go don't okay kids kids let's move on kids you tell me what do you see a yellow dot a guy get get more creative son oh I like that I like that because the color is telling you okay all right another one another guess right a star a moon I like that okay I'm gonna give you the next slide or what do you see now oh a comma so that might be a full stop a period thank you to the 12 year old they in the back it's a full stop and that's a comma and do you see how how small the difference is okay so I want to to focus on that and say please Lord in my life you are the only full stop I cannot put a full stop on my life I cannot put the full stop on my walk on my on my business on my work on my lovely family on the bonds of Love of my fellowship here around the word please Lord do not put a full stop give me some relation give me something to to press on not to get comfortable I want to be that comma I want to be that comma here's my bold statement God cannot change and exactly because of that reason you will always change if you are hungry and if you are sincere to the Lord God Almighty and you look back and you see I've got one constant in my life one concert that's Jehovah then you will always have a comma you will always have the benefit benefit of the debt you will always have the back of your brother you are always just try and be the the better version of yourself from yesterday right now this I say Brethren that Flesh and Blood Jimmy did you read this on Sunday I think uh cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither do corruption inherit incorruption my previous statement now behold I show you a mystery you shall not all sleep but you shall all be changed who can tell me what's then verse 52. all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I'm telling you don't wait for that day to be changed right we start now may that twinkling of November I look natural to this world you are so so contrary to this world you are so walking uh absolutely different step to what this this world can offer you that it'll just be a twinkling of an eye and we disappear now I want to sort of I was thinking about um what what this let's go back to the comma the comma indicates a pause right it indicates Parts it splits up parts of a sentence of a structure it gives you a place to sort of catch your breath rest and then press on you would say I think brother Isaac would say a joke the punchline is that comma is so important if you have that little pause at the right place you can deliver that um that joke uh Dave you did it so well at the at the wedding eh yeah we're waiting for that recording it indicates changes coming perhaps a continuation of something right so there might be a slight Direction change but you still still going in the same same angle the same direction right the comma here for me indicates a change a change in your circumstances and your walk and the expectation of something more to come let me just step back quickly everything that brother anyone here says to you is always from a from a spiritual connection a spiritual connotation like brother Marcus how have your spiritual jackets on right I I see something in the natural I see something physical and I always go and hunt for what is the spiritual where's the original from this one where's where did it all start so please have that in your mind while I'm going through all this so a change in circumstances in your walk an expectation of something more to come more to be revealed as in we are not done yet okay and as we say usually in our in our um sort of in the corporate world we've said it a lot a lot of times here um the only constant in life as we commonly say is change so the only thing that you can absolutely expect in your life is change okay I'm going to say this word change quite a bit right so let's go to that next scripture that we'll have it here yes I do and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable look at those commas and perfect will of God right it's a continuation it's more and more and it's better and better as you read this sentence and this is where I sort of want to change pardon the pun the word change here relates quite closely to the word renew okay and if you look through the scripts as well a renewal of the mind so it means there's a change that happening a bitumen something that's that's to come right so I went sort of on a hunt tonight and I looked at what is the what is the renew means to resume an activity after an interruption now praise be to God what an interruption have you had in your life Brother Andy when you were on the on the bad side of the prison bars what an interruption did you have in your life and what happened then there was a comma there was a change there was a renewal yeah and did it ever stop did it ever stop if I look at if I look brother Isaac if like Dave 10 years ago where he was just your testimony on set on Sunday and where is he now right that shows me as well he hasn't put a period he hasn't put a full stop on his life now what is what is his the Lord can can work with you in such an incredible way when you go to him and say Lord I know nothing uh this is you've been awesome to me you've revealed this to me where I am at this point of my life but it's a comma please add more to your word in my life the Collins Dictionary says um to bring back to original condition of freshness and vigor I love that I love that the original condition so interesting that a renewal or a change can bring you back to the original condition and this is what we want bride this is what we want we want the original condition but it's going to be fresh because our bodies are going to be changed amen now yeah here we go gonna jump straight into it and I hope you can follow speaking here of legion he crossed the Sea and the disciples had been very weary and he still the water or the sea for them crossed all the way over in gadara where there was a maniac so One Singular person right taking the chance of crossing the stormy sea when the Devils of the sea swore they'd drowned him that night but he went over there for the Cry of one person one poor Maniac now this is very important to me and I I actually prayed I I I haven't read this quote before well probably I've I've heard it but not in this context and how it had lined in my mind I said Lord wasn't wasn't Legion just a good man was he just not you know he had he was a husband to to kids uh to a to a wife and and a dad to kids you know but I think what happened is he had a full stop in his life I think he maybe got a bit comfortable where he was in his circumstances say I'm going to sit a bit I'm going to stop a bit I think I've I've preached the bet the battle enough a bit and he stopped and what happens here perhaps a good man one day or one time walked upright before God but probably got in the wrong crowd might be starting drinking or something lost his mind and he lived out in the tombs where the demons lived now listen we don't have to even go that far down the path of of drinking and smoking and gambling and an addiction I'm saying I'm seeing churches and it's not far from from from our walk and and and what we believe where where they are putting a full stop and I'm and and I'm praying for for guidance in our lives and are praying for for grace and mercy that they keep that comma keep pushing on where they want to say we've received this we we don't have to have anything more um it's been given to us the last prophet of this age and we'll just follow what what he sees this just just quote him just this nothing more just just go back to that message just go back to that quote just go okay the Lord is not for for us said he's moving the light is moving the light is not stopping for for no reason Okay so we've got incredible responsibility now that our prophet of our age is off the scene to be that hands and feet to come to a quote like this and explain and open up and break the bread and what is our fresh Manna for today for this Lord because he was maybe saying it in 1954. what is maybe for our day so the the maybe the the the people there lifted for our day they had the comma so what are we doing about that right now here's the interesting thing that I think from I'll just go back to our renewal renewing of the Mind now all of a sudden I'm quoting you Legion so oh I actually want to read that very last little bit there he crossed the Seas leave the Heavens to answer that prayer it's the same Jesus yesterday today and forever that means that's that's the full stop hunting us that's the full stop hearing our cries that's that's the one the constant that's that's that's hearing hearing us right so jumping now to the complete opposite of renew and that's religion religion is a full stop religion we take the Catholics we take when when Martin Luther came on the scene we look at the people that adopted that and the light moved on and the religion stayed Okay so we've received what we've received we're comfortable we're sitting down we're building our houses now what happens now this house well these These Walls go up usually when you stop for a little bit too long as things coming and growing and there's a war coming up now from the inside of that you might feel safe from there you might say well none of these um new extreme things like um or example in my life when I came into this message and I received my first message and I listened to this whole life story of William Branham I go there's a few things I need to shelf here I can't work through that right now now if I did not have that com if I did not have a heart with the change now God is Sovereign he gives us that okay so but through the Lord's Grace he said listen I'm cutting from this cloth and you are on the right side of this cloth he's Sovereign and I had that comma Now in my will my free model agent I could say I was comfortable before I received this I was it but I wasn't comfortable I just told Heinz I was church hopping everywhere I wasn't comfortable I didn't find rest I didn't find the peace where's the love you know it was all around me but it was it that the truth it was good but was a truth you know so anyway coming back to religion it gets comfortable and the wars go up right so what happens if the wars go up and the sun comes up if the if it's a big nice fortified wall and you sitting on the inside of the wall the sun is coming up are you feeling it on your face are you are you consuming what is what is being given to you it's now just going over your top over your head okay the walls are sort of protecting you but it's keeping the sun that's moving away from you so that you cannot get that vitamin D now in this case it's probably vitamin Alpha and Omega you know so and that's and that's just just a thought within my in my study do not let's not repeat the life of legion let's not and and I'm coloring it in I'm using my imagination he could have been a very good guy it could have been a husband could have had kids he had maybe a decent job but somewhere he stopped along the line somewhere he said no change anymore no no seeking anymore no scrolling the scriptures to find fresh Manna for the day now I think I've read that no I haven't here we go not long after that no no that's my very very last very last thought that I want to give you yes is this okay so before we go into that I'll just keep it on that religion so here's my sort of my leading up to it and I just want to mention a few uh things and a few questions and you can answer it in your in yourself okay so who did our lamb come for when he stooped down to earth he came to those outside a religion okay he came to the Fishermans and the tax collectors that were not good enough Scholars for the Pharisees for those outside the synagogues that were safe inside their fortresses of religion they missed them they missed the Messiah took going back to Renewal going back to change Abraham changed to Abraham but it did not stop there there was a comma and him and Sarah they changed more even physically right Saul changed to Paul but I I imagine when he changed from Saul to Paul under Damascus Road he was not expecting he's going to sit and worship and sing along in a prison cell down the line right and probably the most most fortified prison I guess at that point so he had to have that comma he had to have if this is the Lord God Almighty speaking to me on this Damascus Road there must be more then he can't revealed to me all he can't give us all everything at the same time we will not be able to handle it okay our our physical our flesh cannot be handled now okay that's Old Testament that's New Testament who has seen a change in Benjamin and Margaret since they've moved down to to Willington right and I can tell you now you can put a comma there because they will come back from this honeymoon and you will see them refreshed and renewed and changed absolutely for the good how they've would have grown into together and to themselves intertwined but how they are chasing after the goodness of God right for their lives now that brings me then to sort of the the second to last comment I want to make is why is testimony so powerful why is someone's testimony so powerful and why do I I pull so much from a testimony is because I can hear the commas I can hear the change I can hear the the Lord wasn't done with you okay Lord what's next you know where he goes out of the depths and get us right there was a comma and he could work with that if there's a full stop he's a gentleman he will step back right and that's why testimonies are so powerful the only thing that that that can't change from the testimony is the testimony it's is the holistic is the whole okay within that there's so many stuff that changes and and makes that this this this shiny Diamond you know or piece of polished gold that you can't if you change anything you take away the testimony right and then prayer so surely and I've had this in the Sunday School surely we don't pray the same every time look at our prayer requests that come forth tonight it's never the same it constantly changed and we go Lord um you know last night we were sitting and praying as a family and um our neighbors you know all of a sudden I'm thinking and our light needs to just consume our neighbors need to push into their lives without us speaking a word seeing the difference seeing our kids seeing Joy feeling it you know tangible that yeah and that comes down to that comes down to pray so I want to plead to you tonight pray for change pray in your life that we just continue on down this road a few few things that I noted down here is even even brother Branham he said from the pulpit he was pleading with the people that he is nothing right he is not not the one that they wanted to put the period on right but pointed them to Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today forever he's trying to say that he is still changing the prophet himself still renewing to that glorious glorified body that is awaiting him and at one stage he was even even skeptic about people speaking in tongues you know and he said it over the pulpit but what happened he changed now all of a sudden he said Lord I do not understand and he comes and this this has been revealed to him the last one then and many many many examples I can take out of the Scriptures it is actually incredible to sit there and there's so so many things I wanted to share tonight when I started open and if you take a a vague subject something like change you know where do you start where do you end you know um our whole life is is on this Lord change me Lord you know you cannot you cannot put a period in this flesh you cannot put and we read it in the in the corruptable right keep pressing on last slide talking about Blind by the Mayas not long after that he was shivering in the cold one day they heard a voice God had provided the lamb for blind brother mice um eyes he come along the street and he said what's all that noise so obviously he could hear there was a noise coming so usually there's noise where he is praise the lord we sing We Praise we shout when he comes in and they change the atmosphere isn't it what's all that noise he said one uh Jesus of Nazareth passed by he threw down his coat so he was shivering right so not looking where it is uh where it went he didn't care God had provided a lamb he got right to the lamb he said oh Jesus thou son of David have mercy have mercy the rich people and those who stood around get close to the prophet the king he said Oh Be Still he can't hear you I cried that much more so please change that in your in your In Your Vessel cry more then if you think he's not hearing you cry more um the days of Miracles past there's no such thing as of today he crowd louder thou son of David have mercy on me have mercy on me and God provided the lamb he said you you showed me your your your pause you showed that you cannot stop um looking for for truth and for the yes and amen I will come and I will sup with you he provided the lamb and what I wanted to say is maybe the maybe the musicians can come maybe the musicians can come I want to and to say that um there's there's a few schools that say that the Last Supper could have happened on a Wednesday and a Thursday I'm not here to make doctrines I was just reading up as I was researching a few things and I thought well we should not wait for Easter to come we should not wait for that Good Friday all right Lord and how how how rich the last supper was and what it meant when he broke the bread let's take it in tonight let's let's enjoy it tonight already but as an expectation of what is to come what is our Good Friday what is that that change that we're looking for this time around in 2023 okay they might be not not be another Easter okay so how are you preparing for that last supper how are you preparing for the Good Friday and that empty grave um I wanted to sing our own Easter song were it not for thy Nails guard hands is it if you want to stand with me we can sing and then [Music] for thy Nails God hands Nails God hands [Music] were it not for my love for me I'm failing love that your scour [Music] in such a Wonder you give your power [Music] da da for thou foreign [Music] [Music] let it all you chose me to be the one that you can't hold the one that you

chose me you chose me when you chose me [Music] Lord you chose me you chose me Lord you chose me Lord you've chosen us Lord you've looked into our lives Lord and you saw that we we had that attitude Lord of of saying more of you Lord and less of me Lord you saw that that attitude to say that I can change Lord I can walk Closer to You Lord Lord I I'm not comfortable without every part of my being surrounded and consumed by you Lord and so we are pushing together this battle my Lord to walk together hand in hand shoulder to shoulder Lord it is tough out there Lord it is hard I'm just praying
