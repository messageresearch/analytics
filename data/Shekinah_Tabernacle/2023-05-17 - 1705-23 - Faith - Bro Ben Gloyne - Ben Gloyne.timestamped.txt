[36:05] then Moses called for all the Elders of
[36:07] Israel and said unto them draw out and
[36:09] take your lamb according to your
[36:11] families and kill the Passover and you
[36:13] shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it
[36:15] in the blood that is in the Basin and
[36:17] strike the lintel and the two side posts
[36:19] with the blood that is in the Basin and
[36:21] none of you shall go out out at the door
[36:23] of his house until the morning for the
[36:25] Lord will pass through to Smite the
[36:27] Egyptians and when he see it the blood
[36:29] upon the lintel and on the two side uh
[36:31] post the Lord will pass over the door I
[36:34] will not suffer the Destroyer to come
[36:35] and unto your come in unto your houses
[36:39] to Smite you you shall observe this
[36:41] thing for an ordinance to thee and to
[36:43] thy Sons forever that means every
[36:46] generation's got to apply the blood amen
[36:48] so then we go to Hebrews 11 we've got
[36:50] first three verses then we're going to
[36:51] jump down to verse 33 as well
[36:55] um I mean say man if you're there or if
[36:57] you're looking and you can see it's
[36:58] there
[37:00] amen
[37:02] Hebrews 11 and 1. now Faith is the
[37:05] substance of things hoped for the
[37:07] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[37:09] the elders obtained a good report
[37:11] through faith we understand that the
[37:13] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[37:15] that things which are seen were not made
[37:17] of things which do appear then we're
[37:19] going to go down to verse 33 who through
[37:21] faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[37:23] righteousness obtained promises stop the
[37:25] mouths of lions quench the violence of
[37:27] fire escape the edge of the sword out of
[37:29] weakness were made strong wax Valiant
[37:32] and fight turn to flight the armies of
[37:34] the aliens women receive their dead race
[37:36] to life again and others were tortured
[37:38] not accepting Deliverance that they
[37:40] might obtain a better Resurrection yeah
[37:43] amen and and we won't read it but you
[37:45] can keep reading down you know when you
[37:46] go home but it says of whom the world is
[37:48] not worthy these people have this kind
[37:50] of a faith amen and I'm persuaded that
[37:52] that faith is alive Amen in this room
[37:55] tonight in our hearts amen so this bow
[37:57] heads in a word of prayer tonight amen

[38:54] give you glory in Jesus Christ's name
[38:56] amen amen amen God bless your friends
[38:58] you may have your seats tonight I want
[39:00] to talk about our faith faith this
[39:03] common Faith Overlook you know faith is
[39:05] a very overlooked thing that we possess
[39:07] you know I was after the baptisms um a
[39:10] couple of Sundays ago I was I was
[39:12] noticing I think it was General Malachi
[39:14] were doing a bit of landscaping there by
[39:15] the Riverside and one of them had a had
[39:18] had some kind of a weed in their hand I
[39:20] said you know that's like common Faith
[39:22] you know your faith is like that weed
[39:24] you have it's such a common thing you
[39:25] know as we read there in Exodus chapter
[39:27] 12 that they were commanded to take a
[39:30] bunch of hyssop and um and and and
[39:32] that's the that's the that's the
[39:34] paintbrush that they would use Amen to
[39:36] apply the blood to their houses the door
[39:38] and lentil that the death angel could
[39:40] not strike and that you know herself was
[39:42] not some some some very rarest of the
[39:44] rare plant up some mountains somewhere
[39:46] they had to go across the world to find
[39:47] but it was growing everywhere coming out
[39:49] of the cracks and the crevices you know
[39:51] it's amazing where weeds can grow
[39:54] rocks you know I remember when we used
[39:56] to live over here you know there was a
[39:58] bunch of seeds and stuff would come down
[40:00] off the bank and they'll be just on
[40:01] solid concrete and massive yeah you know
[40:04] just just weeds growing they don't even
[40:05] have root you know any soil to go down
[40:07] into but yet they're growing just a
[40:09] common weeds growing everywhere but
[40:10] that's how common faith is you know
[40:12] faith is a very common thing hey the
[40:15] Lord typed it to hyssop right so he's
[40:17] not saying it's a rare thing so the
[40:18] faith that we use to apply the blood
[40:20] Amen in every situation of life is a
[40:23] common weed is it called faith is a
[40:25] common thing I mean the same Faith you
[40:27] used to turn on the light bulb is the
[40:29] same faith that you can you can apply
[40:31] every promise of God with amen so let's
[40:34] not Overlook the faith that's in our
[40:35] position right now amen I'm so thankful
[40:38] that we're not just taking the hyssop
[40:40] taking our faith and just got nothing to
[40:42] apply or use it in amen you know we
[40:44] don't have some Creed we're trying to
[40:45] apply to our lives but as the blood of
[40:47] Jesus Christ himself it means I'm so
[40:49] thankful that we have that kind of a
[40:51] faith now Faith we know is a it's a
[40:53] substance of things hoped for we read
[40:55] it's the evidence of Things Not Seen so
[40:57] it's not some mental workup it's not
[40:59] some kind of just trying to you know
[41:01] some kind of mental illusion but
[41:02] something you actually possess something
[41:05] you have it's actually the the substance
[41:07] of something that you're hopeful so a
[41:09] promise that you're looking to be
[41:10] fulfilled in your life when you receive
[41:12] faith for that promise it's actually the
[41:14] evidence of that thing's gonna happen I
[41:16] don't know I mean because we do not walk
[41:18] by faith I mean by sight we walk by
[41:20] faith
[41:21] amen now brother Braham tells us that
[41:23] you know there's well we know that
[41:24] there's um
[41:26] five senses that we've been given to
[41:28] come contact our Earthly home
[41:30] but not one of those is actually meant
[41:33] to guide man
[41:34] brother Brown tells us now I want to get
[41:36] you something here God when he made man
[41:38] gave him five senses and those five
[41:40] senses of see taste feel smell in here
[41:42] as we all know those five senses were
[41:45] not given to a man to guide him that
[41:48] seems quite strange because you know
[41:49] when you you know you go through natural
[41:51] man would think no I I need those five
[41:54] senses to guide me through life but
[41:55] they're not there
[41:56] to guide you through life those five
[41:59] senses will not guide you through this
[42:00] life amen that's actually only given for
[42:03] us to contact our Earthly home I mean
[42:06] the sea tastes feel smell in here that
[42:08] and that's your Earthly senses we're not
[42:10] see and they were not given to you to
[42:13] guide you but God sent the Holy Spirit
[42:15] and he's your guide the sixth sense I
[42:18] mean that makes you believe things that
[42:20] you can't see taste feel smell or hear
[42:22] that Sixth Sense something that raised
[42:24] you up and only one class of people has
[42:26] that sixth sense that's Believers so I
[42:29] believe I'm talking to people who have
[42:30] that sixth sense right now amen
[42:32] Believers have that Sixth Sense amen
[42:34] Hebrews 11 and 1 said by faith and
[42:36] without faith it's impossible to please
[42:38] God so God gives man faith and faith is
[42:41] a sixth sense that makes you deny
[42:43] anything that's contrary to his word
[42:46] amen and you're so thankful we have that
[42:47] kind of ability amen if something
[42:49] declares in our body that we're never
[42:52] going to overcome we may feel down we
[42:54] don't we can we can subdue that feeling
[42:55] and bring get subject to the word of God
[42:58] if there's something warring in our
[42:59] memories of some person that we
[43:01] committed and they would put it under
[43:02] the blood the devil brings it back in
[43:04] our mind we can take our sixth sense
[43:06] faith and subdue that memory and say no
[43:08] Satan I'm going to update that memory
[43:10] for the day where I became a Believer
[43:12] and you got defeated out of my life see
[43:14] we've got to let Faith loose and control
[43:16] of Our Lives amen our I you know our
[43:19] five senses should not dictate our
[43:21] Victory to us amen remember faith is our
[43:24] Victory amen Faith gives us victory over
[43:27] this world over this evil age over every
[43:29] devil amen Faith gives us the victory
[43:31] the Bible said amen is not our five
[43:34] senses give us the Victorious not what
[43:35] we can think in our mind gives us the
[43:37] victory no it's faith amen I trust you
[43:40] can just just just just join in with me
[43:42] tonight I mean because remember we've
[43:44] got this common see faith can be such an
[43:46] overlooked thing so sometimes we think
[43:48] we need some big super duper Faith to
[43:50] overcome no the common Faith you have
[43:52] already that Faith you may be
[43:54] overlooking think it's not enough it's
[43:56] more than enough I mean because that
[43:58] hyssop that applied the blood was more
[43:59] than enough to apply the blood there in
[44:01] Egypt's the same faith that we've been
[44:03] given as more than enough to overcome I
[44:05] mean to apply the blood to every part of
[44:07] our Lives amen hallelujah but you see
[44:10] now Faith see faith faith subdues faith
[44:13] overtakes Faith conquers I mean see we
[44:16] are not here just to put up with the
[44:18] devil's nonsense you know you know man
[44:20] has an idea that you know things are
[44:22] just going to work out in a natural way
[44:24] yeah right amen like a sickness we think
[44:26] well it's a virus it's got to take this
[44:28] long to work out you'll have these kind
[44:30] of symptoms and this is going to happen
[44:31] this way and you've just got to let it
[44:33] run its course who said we have to let
[44:35] it run its course amen anything in life
[44:38] Faith interrupts the devil's plans I
[44:41] mean Faith always interrupts what the
[44:42] devil thinks he's gonna do I mean the
[44:45] devil thought that he had Israel trapped
[44:47] in Egypt but then Faith interrupted his
[44:50] plans in the form of the Prophet Moses
[44:52] and God anointed Moses and went and took
[44:54] them out why because Faith interrupted
[44:56] the devil's plans and faith will
[44:58] interrupt if you let your faith control
[45:00] you not your reasoning control you but
[45:02] your faith control you amen that faith
[45:04] will interrupt the devil's plans every
[45:06] time all right amen you say well it
[45:08] doesn't seem like it's being answered
[45:09] well real faith will trust God no matter
[45:12] what the answer is
[45:14] amen because remember our Victor and our
[45:16] joy should not be based on current
[45:18] circumstances no that's actually our
[45:20] five senses dictating to us how much of
[45:22] a Christian we are yeah
[45:25] so we shouldn't be it doesn't matter how
[45:27] you know we're gonna we're gonna let
[45:29] Faith raise us above all the gloom and
[45:31] doom in this world Amen because Faith
[45:33] gives us wings to fly amen because
[45:35] because remember we walk in a different
[45:37] kind of an atmosphere with the Sixth
[45:39] Sense we contact a world that the rest
[45:42] of the world doesn't know nothing about
[45:43] and when we contact heaven with this
[45:45] success amen with this Faith amen we
[45:48] contact the promises of God we're
[45:49] walking around that's different
[45:52] see we can rejoice in the promises of
[45:54] God Amen we can Rejoice then because
[45:57] they're so real they're so tangible to
[45:58] us aren't they Hallelujah we can have
[46:00] Fellowship about what God has done in
[46:02] the past and and and and and all we're
[46:05] really doing is actually remembering the
[46:07] times where God was taking on his word
[46:09] and God said I'll prove that in your
[46:11] life but then you go on the street and
[46:13] start sharing those same things to
[46:15] people who have know nothing about God
[46:16] they think you're a crazy man what
[46:19] because you're living in a world they
[46:20] know nothing about amen but I trust that
[46:22] by God's grace they will know the world
[46:24] that you live in so you see it's just
[46:26] because other people are walking in Doom
[46:28] and Gloom atmosphere doesn't mean we
[46:30] have to live in that same kind of
[46:31] atmosphere Faith lifts us above the doom
[46:33] and the Gloom maybe you could be you can
[46:35] be in a house where there's a real
[46:36] gloomy kind of you know Spirit
[46:38] everything's dark and heavy you don't
[46:40] have to live in that atmosphere faith
[46:42] will lift you above that atmosphere if
[46:44] you let it lift
[46:45] Hallelujah just so just because everyone
[46:47] else is gloomy doesn't mean you've got
[46:48] to get gloomy just because everyone else
[46:50] is weary doesn't mean we have to be
[46:52] weary we can be rejoicing everyone else
[46:54] can have the longest face in the world
[46:55] Amen they look like a bunch of horses
[46:57] but we can be rejoicing I mean why
[47:00] because faith has given us the victory
[47:01] over every problem
[47:03] Hallelujah
[47:05] amen you say well wonder I get that
[47:08] Faith No no you've got that Faith now
[47:09] hey have you ever given your life to the
[47:11] Lord you have that Faith hallelujah
[47:13] hallelujah amen if you got faith in the
[47:16] word of God what is that that is genuine
[47:18] faith never let the devil diminish that
[47:19] at all
[47:20] Hallelujah
[47:22] amen see faith faith takes control of
[47:25] situations you know the Apostle Peter
[47:28] was in prison one day and it's amazing
[47:30] when you think about it he was going to
[47:31] be executed in the morning but he got
[47:33] comfortable in his prison took off his
[47:35] shoes took off his coat said well I must
[47:37] just sleep here and enjoy the place and
[47:39] people can get so used to the prison
[47:40] they're in and many times we try and we
[47:43] try and mentally with our five senses
[47:45] try and get them out of the prison of
[47:47] unbelief they're in but you've got to
[47:48] realize your wrestling against demon
[47:49] powers you're not fighting against the
[47:51] person and reasoning and trying to work
[47:53] out things no no it's it's it takes the
[47:55] power of prayer it takes faith I mean to
[47:58] unlock the prison because Peter got used
[48:00] to being in that prison
[48:02] when the angel came and woke him up he
[48:04] said put on your shoes good yourself
[48:05] you're getting out of here but he got
[48:07] comfortable enough to say well this is
[48:09] just me
[48:10] and people can get so used to the prison
[48:12] that they're in amen but facials say no
[48:14] they shouldn't be in that prison I mean
[48:16] because they had a perimeting that night
[48:18] I mean the angel went and got him out of
[48:20] that prison and got him out he thought
[48:21] he was having a dream but then when he
[48:23] walked out of the front Gates he came to
[48:25] himself and said I wasn't dreaming this
[48:27] hey man why because Faith Delivered him
[48:29] out of that prison
[48:31] Hallelujah said well what if it didn't
[48:33] well I'd say you know worry help no one
[48:35] but faith can deliver
[48:37] you know brother Bram said you know if I
[48:39] knew I was going to get shot in the
[48:40] morning he said what's the point of
[48:42] worrying it won't help me but Faith
[48:43] might deliver me that's why we're gonna
[48:45] let our faith take control of Our Lives
[48:47] not our not our five senses not our
[48:49] reasoning you know I remember when when
[48:51] Chris and I were living in Christchurch
[48:52] during the first earthquake there and
[48:54] the place is shaking we're having a
[48:56] prayer meeting by the front door and I
[48:58] wanted just to keep my eyes open to see
[49:00] what was going on but I thought no we're
[49:02] praying we're going to pray instead of
[49:03] just but the five senses wanted to
[49:05] because because for some reasons we
[49:07] think if we observe something we have
[49:08] control over it you know we'd have
[49:12] nothing I had no control over the
[49:13] earthquake of my eyes were open if my
[49:15] eyes were closed I had no control but we
[49:17] seem to think if we observe something
[49:19] hard enough we can take dominion over it
[49:21] no it takes our faith to have dominion
[49:24] over it
[49:25] hallelujah amen and and so what did I do
[49:28] I close my eyes and keep praying we had
[49:30] a glorious prayer time God came down and
[49:32] we had an awesome time when the world
[49:33] was shaking Hallelujah so that's what we
[49:36] should do I think Amen Let our faith
[49:38] take control
[49:40] amen
[49:44] Hallelujah now Faith is something I'm
[49:47] just going to go through a few things
[49:48] faith is something that you it's
[49:50] absolutely it's not just what you
[49:51] imagine it's a reality many people I say
[49:54] this with humble humility because see I
[49:57] may never see you again from tonight
[49:58] they're probably as people that are here
[50:00] I'll never see again in my life but I
[50:02] say that 80 of the people that comes to
[50:05] the platform don't know what faith is
[50:06] they have a hope but not faith faith is
[50:10] a substance of things hopeful the
[50:11] evidence of Things Not Seen amen so see
[50:14] it's not something that you work up
[50:15] mentally it's a reality to you it's
[50:18] become revealed to your heart it's not
[50:19] something in your mind thinking I hope
[50:20] this works you know it's done
[50:22] hey man see now Faith is a revelation
[50:25] from God
[50:26] now Faith is a revelation that's just
[50:28] where I want to stay here just a moment
[50:30] it's a revelation he has revealed it to
[50:31] you by his grace it's nothing you did
[50:34] you didn't work yourself up into Faith
[50:36] you you ever have faith it's given to
[50:38] you by the grace of God and God reveals
[50:40] it to you therefore faith is a
[50:42] revelation and the whole Church of God
[50:43] is built upon Revelation a Baptist
[50:45] Minister told me not uh not long ago he
[50:48] said I just can't accept Revelation I
[50:50] said now you cannot then you cannot
[50:52] accept the Bible you cannot accept
[50:54] Christ because he is the revelation of
[50:56] God he's God revealed in flesh therefore
[50:59] the whole church is built upon divine
[51:02] revelation yeah amen so it's not
[51:04] something you work yourself up into oh I
[51:06] gotta have a big face no no
[51:08] it's something God gives
[51:11] and it can be such a common thing we'll
[51:13] just jump right over it and say I'm
[51:15] looking for this thing I need to
[51:16] overcome that and you've already got the
[51:17] faith to do it
[51:20] but then within how do I get more faith
[51:22] well Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[51:24] by the word of God Amen as I said a few
[51:26] you know a few Sundays ago you wanna you
[51:28] wanna you wanna focus on the promise
[51:30] feed on the promise till it becomes a
[51:32] revelation I mean it's not just a nice
[51:34] idea but you feed on it think about it
[51:36] pray about it until God makes it a
[51:38] revelation in your heart Hallelujah
[51:40] that's what we've got to do
[51:43] amen but you see now real faith has no
[51:46] conditions on it brother bear says you
[51:48] take your father it's always saying Lord
[51:49] I'll do this if you'll do this and
[51:51] things like that God knows he'll be a
[51:52] stuffed shirt anyhow so it's not a it's
[51:55] not a faith is not or prayer it's not a
[51:57] negotiation process with God the reason
[51:59] we know negotiate with God is because
[52:01] we're not surrendered to him fully
[52:03] in that certain situation amen so we've
[52:06] got to be fully fully sold out and let
[52:08] Faith have its perfect work
[52:10] amen see see for repentance or a mission
[52:13] of sins must be preached in his name to
[52:16] all the world beginning at Jerusalem
[52:17] Hallelujah Glory there you are what does
[52:19] Calvary mean to you what did that day do
[52:22] to you did it stuff you out with some
[52:24] theology did it make you a stuffed shirt
[52:26] or did it make you a Christian sold out
[52:29] hallelujah amen so what is Calvary done
[52:32] to you amen have you become a stuffed
[52:33] shirt a Mr or Mrs no at all or has it
[52:36] made you sold out a real Christian
[52:38] loving the Lord more than anything
[52:40] amen but you see now
[52:44] reasoning and Faith are two very
[52:46] different things and reasoning works
[52:48] against faith
[52:49] and Faith controls reasoning subdues
[52:52] reasoning amen now Faith knows no defeat
[52:55] faith is perfect Faith brings things
[52:58] when they were um where there is no
[53:00] thing to be brought Faith creates Faith
[53:02] takes doubt away takes negative and
[53:05] makes positive how beautiful the old man
[53:07] had a basis for faith faith is not
[53:09] Mystic mythical something mentally
[53:12] worked up is absolutely fundamental
[53:14] result that happens in a person's heart
[53:16] it means it's not something that's just
[53:18] a mythical mentally worked up one plus
[53:20] one equals two or window or whatever
[53:23] kind of drawing thing no no no no it's
[53:25] it's something happens in your heart you
[53:26] know it's there and the but the devil
[53:29] ways bring reasoning in to try and kick
[53:31] your faith off
[53:32] amen but that's why we've got to stand
[53:34] on stand on the word of God Alone who's
[53:36] with me tonight I mean I might be
[53:38] Plastering this a bit thick but I want
[53:39] you to see it amen because we don't want
[53:41] to be walking in the Realms of a mental
[53:43] idea but we're going to walk in the
[53:45] Realms of thus saith the Lord like a
[53:47] real faith in the word of God it's
[53:48] anchored in the word of God Amen that
[53:51] you know it so just like I trust that
[53:52] you know that you're saved amen right
[53:54] you don't think you're saved you know
[53:56] you're saved like you've come according
[53:59] to God's word but God's revealed it to
[54:01] you that he died for you on Calvary it's
[54:02] a revelation the blood is a revelation
[54:04] to you amen so what is that that's real
[54:06] faith and if you've realized that he
[54:09] died for you amen nothing can move you
[54:10] from it if it's a revelation in your
[54:12] heart
[54:13] Hallelujah no one can talk you out of it
[54:15] no one talked you into it God just drew
[54:17] you to it amen
[54:18] Hallelujah that's real Faith now look
[54:21] not because I'm standing here saying it
[54:22] but if you can understand how it is that
[54:25] faith is not something mentally
[54:26] perceived but it is by a revelation a
[54:29] revelation of God by faith not
[54:30] intellectual but by his uh but by his
[54:34] heart see your faith is not what you
[54:36] feel your faith is what you believe how
[54:39] many times do we let feelings Rob us or
[54:41] victory right no no no no faith faith is
[54:44] a revelation it's not a feeling see we
[54:47] could feel As Dead As opposed see the
[54:49] two on the way to Emmaus their lives are
[54:51] broken they're broken-hearted their
[54:52] whole world have fallen apart they are
[54:54] walking along with the resurrected Jesus
[54:56] Christ himself amen that was the
[54:58] condition I earned when the Lord came
[55:00] and and began to reveal himself to them
[55:02] and they are part of the Resurrection
[55:04] that's why Jesus went with them broke
[55:05] the Bread open their eyes all those
[55:07] things but you see it's not based on how
[55:09] we feel it's based on what we believe
[55:12] I mean if you're feeling down in the
[55:14] Lord you just begin to think about what
[55:16] you believe and what he's done for you
[55:18] and then you'll find your feelings will
[55:19] go upwards like this amen why because
[55:21] your feelings will begin to linen with
[55:23] what you believe amen that's what we
[55:26] should do amen always just take God take
[55:28] our take our take our testimony back to
[55:31] the word of God
[55:32] I mean see see we're not going to feel
[55:34] the rapture
[55:36] on the day when our bodies have changed
[55:38] in terms of uh well I'm wrapped you're
[55:39] ready today because I'm sure we've had a
[55:41] lot of those kind of days
[55:43] I'm going today is the day I'm ready
[55:46] next minute Lord help me I'm not ready
[55:48] but why if you go in my feelings it's a
[55:50] roller coaster of emotions amen but if
[55:52] you go no your faith is what you believe
[55:54] not what you feel amen then the devil
[55:57] can't whip you with your feelings
[55:58] anymore
[56:00] Hallelujah see faith is a subconscious
[56:02] Thing lady faith is not a mental act see
[56:05] it's something that you subconsciously
[56:07] do it people try to look to their
[56:08] intellectuals for Faith When Faith
[56:10] doesn't lay in there reasons lay here
[56:13] Faith lays in the soul see so like see
[56:15] see people try to look at the
[56:16] intellectuals their mind what they think
[56:18] what they perceive for their faith but
[56:20] Faith doesn't lay here reasoning does
[56:23] Faith lays here in the soul amen but you
[56:26] see now if you're trying to lay your
[56:28] your faith in your intellectuals we're
[56:30] reasoning in then unbelief will catch
[56:32] that reason
[56:33] I mean see see but unbelievable catch
[56:36] reason that's what it did now you get it
[56:38] unbelief relies on reasons present day
[56:41] things Faith don't won't do that see now
[56:45] see see he's saying here unbelief relies
[56:47] on reasons what's that that's going on
[56:49] in your mind the weighing all the
[56:51] weighing all the things together taking
[56:52] all the evidence and trying to lay it in
[56:54] there that's reasoning going on but you
[56:56] see unbelief relies on reasons
[56:59] present day things I think I thought
[57:01] that was a interesting how how the
[57:03] prophet put those two things together
[57:04] see present day things well how are you
[57:07] doing today yeah not so good then
[57:10] reasoning comes in well you must have
[57:12] done something wrong
[57:13] no not at all
[57:15] you know many times we we're actually
[57:19] getting an answer to prayer and we
[57:21] actually think it's actually not an
[57:22] answer to prayer like for example
[57:24] Saul but before he became Paul how he
[57:27] persecuted the church brother Ram said
[57:29] that was a man under conviction
[57:31] that was actually the believer's praise
[57:33] being answered by him kicking up and
[57:34] acting like that and sometimes someone
[57:36] starts fussing and fighting and tearing
[57:38] things up and we and we've prayed Lord
[57:40] get a hold of that person and they start
[57:42] acting that way and we think Lord what's
[57:44] wrong with my faith your faith is
[57:47] working real good yeah yeah just hold on
[57:49] to the promise you don't you don't live
[57:51] by what you see but we look to the
[57:53] Unseen right Faith doesn't look by the
[57:55] everyday thing right I mean Faith looks
[57:58] to the Unseen to the promise of God
[58:00] Hallelujah that's what see faith faith
[58:02] looks at the word
[58:04] amen but Faith places itself upon the
[58:07] unmovable Rock God's Eternal word amen
[58:09] Faith don't look at reason I don't care
[58:12] how much you can show it would be better
[58:14] if the word says no faith rests there
[58:17] that is the sanctuary of Faith's resting
[58:20] place Amen to someone can come along and
[58:22] try and reason things this is how it
[58:24] really should be but faith is no faith
[58:26] rests on the word and that's it
[58:28] I trust that's how you're walking by
[58:30] faith you're not walking by sight no
[58:32] walking by reason and listen this has
[58:34] got to happen first and this has got to
[58:35] be this way who said it's got to be that
[58:37] way you know there's been countless
[58:39] testimonies of people who've been
[58:40] immigrating to other countries and you
[58:42] know their files on the bottom of the
[58:44] pile but somehow God fast tracks their
[58:46] immigration and then they're in well how
[58:48] did that work well actually because God
[58:49] was the immigration agent right but many
[58:52] times you think well it'll be x amount
[58:54] of this six to 12 months I know I know
[58:56] what it is you know some countries it
[58:57] can be years but you know we think well
[58:59] it's just going to take this long and
[59:00] this is going to happen this way who
[59:02] said it's going to happen that way you
[59:04] know God can Inspire some some person
[59:06] walking I don't know what I'm talking
[59:08] about immigration but you know God could
[59:09] Inspire some immigration person instead
[59:11] of the top of the pole they get they're
[59:14] inspired to your your folder and they
[59:16] pick it up and they just go stamp stamp
[59:18] stamp boom and then you get an email
[59:19] that's there whoa God inspired the
[59:21] person to do it you know we we can we
[59:24] can limit God by thinking well things
[59:26] just have to work in a natural order no
[59:28] faith is not a natural order faith is a
[59:30] disrupter of the day
[59:32] Hallelujah let your faith disrupt
[59:34] Satan's Eden once in a while
[59:37] Hallelujah
[59:38] amen see as Jesus would say the scribes
[59:41] and Pharisees they um and when he was
[59:44] demanded of the Pharisees when the
[59:45] Kingdom of Heaven should come he
[59:47] answered them and said the kingdom of
[59:49] God cometh not with observation neither
[59:51] shall they say low here or Lo therefore
[59:53] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[59:55] so he's saying it's not mentally
[59:57] observed it's not mentally studied you
[1:00:00] don't the kingdom of God doesn't come
[1:00:01] with observations you don't study and
[1:00:03] then oh there's the kingdom of God it's
[1:00:05] not observed by the five senses no he
[1:00:08] says the kingdom of God is within you
[1:00:09] what is that that is the Holy Ghost
[1:00:11] within man
[1:00:12] I mean so if you ever see the baptism of
[1:00:14] the Holy Ghost the kingdom of God is
[1:00:16] within you yeah so it's not by
[1:00:18] observation facts and textbooks and
[1:00:19] understandings in schools of learning no
[1:00:21] it's none of those things
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:26] Hallelujah now Faith does not deny
[1:00:28] problems
[1:00:30] Faith acknowledges problems
[1:00:32] hello
[1:00:33] brother William says this he says now
[1:00:35] you can't say I've I've got a sickness
[1:00:37] and I don't and I don't believe it's a
[1:00:39] sickness oh yes it's a sickness you got
[1:00:42] cancer you
[1:00:43] uh you don't believe it's a cancer but
[1:00:45] it's a cancer it's a cancer but remember
[1:00:46] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:00:48] that's in the world we you must realize
[1:00:50] that the Holy Spirit that's in you has
[1:00:52] already overcome this thing and he's in
[1:00:55] you and you can overcome by him that's
[1:00:57] exactly sensible it's exactly the way
[1:00:59] the scripture is written overcoming amen
[1:01:02] right so so Faith doesn't put blinkers
[1:01:04] on and say the problem's not there you
[1:01:06] see when chadrach Meshach and Bendigo
[1:01:08] were going to be thrown into the fiery
[1:01:09] furnace they didn't deny the furnace was
[1:01:10] there they didn't deny that the king's
[1:01:12] Cree I mean um commandment wasn't real
[1:01:15] they acknowledge those things by turning
[1:01:17] up to the whole ceremony
[1:01:20] right but they didn't deny those things
[1:01:21] I said sure King and you know isn't it
[1:01:24] amazing that they went into that furnace
[1:01:26] without even a promise that God would
[1:01:28] deliver them but they just made up their
[1:01:30] mind we're not going to burn I mean I
[1:01:31] mean sorry we're not going to Bow
[1:01:32] whatever the outcome is when we're still
[1:01:35] not going to Bowden you're edicto King
[1:01:37] but you see they didn't even have a
[1:01:39] promise I mean to go and you know yo
[1:01:42] that God would protect them but yeah God
[1:01:43] protected them in the fiery furnace
[1:01:46] hallelujah amen all that they could base
[1:01:48] here faith in was that yo that you Shone
[1:01:51] about her any image
[1:01:53] no other God you should worship that's
[1:01:55] right now
[1:01:57] I'm just trying to find you know um
[1:01:59] PowerPoints are very hazardous things
[1:02:01] for me because it never it's never
[1:02:03] chronological
[1:02:05] but you see Jesus Jesus Went to went to
[1:02:08] Calvary with one promise
[1:02:11] and that promise was I'll not suffer my
[1:02:13] Holy One to see corruption I'll not
[1:02:15] leave thy soul and hell no suffer the
[1:02:17] hollow undersea corruption that was the
[1:02:18] one scripture that was quickened to him
[1:02:20] that he knew that though he's going to
[1:02:23] die on Calvary he's not going to stay
[1:02:25] dead yeah he's going to come out of the
[1:02:26] grave
[1:02:27] now that same Faith so so he went to
[1:02:30] Calvary with one scripture right and he
[1:02:32] came out with that faith in that one
[1:02:34] scripture now the same faith that is in
[1:02:37] him comes into the believer because
[1:02:40] remember as Believers we don't believe
[1:02:42] with just a human Faith remember we
[1:02:45] start off with human Faith but we don't
[1:02:47] stop with human faith we start with it
[1:02:49] but we don't stop with it right because
[1:02:51] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:53] Ghost another faith comes in right just
[1:02:56] as the Apostle Paul would say the life
[1:02:57] here we go the life I know he says I'm
[1:03:00] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:03:01] live yet not I but Christ livethon me
[1:03:03] and the life which I now live in the
[1:03:05] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:03:07] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:03:09] he's saying another life I used to live
[1:03:11] one kind of life but then I met a lot on
[1:03:13] the road to Damascus now I've got a
[1:03:14] different kind of a life he is now the
[1:03:16] life I now live in this flesh I live by
[1:03:19] the faith of the Son of God Amen so he
[1:03:22] wasn't living by his own human faith
[1:03:23] that he was born with no he is now
[1:03:25] living by God's own faith yeah
[1:03:28] Hallelujah so so now Jesus Jesus had
[1:03:31] Jesus had that same faith that Paul
[1:03:34] received Jesus went to the tomb with and
[1:03:38] came out because that same faith that
[1:03:40] Jesus had was in this one scripture a
[1:03:42] lot I'll not leave a soul with hell
[1:03:44] neither will I suffer my Holy One to see
[1:03:46] corruption so now that same Faith went
[1:03:48] into the Apostle Paul and lived out the
[1:03:50] portion of word that he had to live out
[1:03:51] and now we come down to this end time in
[1:03:54] that same faith that was in the Lord
[1:03:56] Jesus amen for that to be fulfilled and
[1:03:58] the same
[1:03:59] um faith that was in the Apostle Paul
[1:04:01] that he went to Rome he was told he was
[1:04:03] going to Rome his shipwreck bitten by
[1:04:04] poisonous snake all kinds of trouble but
[1:04:06] God said you're going to go there and so
[1:04:08] he went there right he didn't see his
[1:04:10] faith took control of the whole
[1:04:12] situation he was in a storm 14 days we
[1:04:14] realized I can't die on this boat I've
[1:04:16] got to get to Rome why because God had
[1:04:18] already revealed it to him that he had
[1:04:20] to be in Rome he wasn't hoping he was
[1:04:22] going to make it across their GNC you
[1:04:24] know across the Mediterranean to Rome it
[1:04:26] was a revealed to him he's going to Rome
[1:04:28] so as soon as the dark clouds started
[1:04:30] Gathering the swell started lifting and
[1:04:32] the wind started blowing and all the
[1:04:34] trouble was going on there was something
[1:04:36] already anchoring him saying I'm not
[1:04:38] gonna drown Hallelujah and then and so
[1:04:41] because he had that Revelation he went
[1:04:43] to God in prayer and then God sent his
[1:04:45] angels saying that you know the only
[1:04:47] thing going to be lost is the boat
[1:04:49] Hallelujah and then they you know
[1:04:51] Shipwrecked then he went to go get the
[1:04:53] firewood the snake came out bit him on
[1:04:55] the hand but he shook it off in the fire
[1:04:57] saying this thing can't stop me because
[1:04:59] I'm going to Rome it was a revelation
[1:05:02] he's going to Rome now friends we're not
[1:05:03] traveling to Italy Today Emma we're
[1:05:05] going to glory amen that's our final
[1:05:07] destination amen so I trust that God has
[1:05:09] anchored of faith in your soul amen that
[1:05:12] nothing can stop you on this side
[1:05:13] nothing can stop you on this Earth
[1:05:15] because your final destination is glory
[1:05:17] amen because the devil cannot undo what
[1:05:20] God has already done amen so before the
[1:05:23] foundation of the world if he if God put
[1:05:25] your name on Islam's book amen then the
[1:05:28] devil doesn't have enough rubbing
[1:05:29] compound Amen to rub your name off the
[1:05:32] book it's impossible amen so the devil
[1:05:34] can't undo what God has already done
[1:05:37] Hallelujah that should really increase
[1:05:38] our faith I think so it doesn't matter
[1:05:40] what troubles we go through hardship
[1:05:42] whatever the devil tries to put down our
[1:05:44] throat saying you'll never overcome you
[1:05:45] say no hold on my name's uh written in
[1:05:48] glory there is a name that's written
[1:05:49] down in glory and it's mine I know the
[1:05:52] author of my story and he's mine
[1:05:54] Hallelujah I am his and he is mine Amen
[1:05:56] to them we can stand on every god-given
[1:05:58] promise of God and we can realize we
[1:06:01] don't have to put up with what the devil
[1:06:03] wants to put upon us no but our faith
[1:06:05] will subdue kingdoms now I'm not talking
[1:06:08] about subjunct National kingdoms I'm
[1:06:09] talking about subduring demon kingdoms I
[1:06:12] mean spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:06:13] amen we have a power tonight and you do
[1:06:17] yourself right now I mean the faith that
[1:06:19] can subdue their Kingdom I mean whatever
[1:06:21] the Devil comes to do against you you
[1:06:23] can kick him back down to Hell from
[1:06:24] whence he came Hallelujah
[1:06:26] I happen to believe it I think our face
[1:06:29] should be rugged it should be Burly
[1:06:31] Faith amen it's not compromising faith
[1:06:33] we should press every battle amen why
[1:06:36] because God has given us every Divine
[1:06:37] promise Hallelujah
[1:06:41] amen see Jarius got to a point
[1:06:44] because his
[1:06:46] um daughter was sick you know the
[1:06:48] doctors couldn't couldn't help her
[1:06:49] anymore but then he he knew that there
[1:06:52] was a man that God lived in his name was
[1:06:56] Jesus however he knew that it was a God
[1:06:58] that he read in the in the Scrolls had
[1:07:00] stepped out of History was now living in
[1:07:02] this man so he decided amen because
[1:07:05] remember he had a lot of pressure going
[1:07:07] on here's the rule of the synagogue
[1:07:10] Jesus wasn't locked in his circles
[1:07:12] anymore
[1:07:13] but so he had to come to a point see
[1:07:16] initially his faith was hindered by what
[1:07:18] he thought what his worried people would
[1:07:20] think of him
[1:07:21] see what will my family say what will my
[1:07:23] colleagues say what will the chief Rabbi
[1:07:25] say in what will the high priest say
[1:07:27] when the news gets to him and all those
[1:07:29] things see his faith was hindered by
[1:07:31] fear
[1:07:32] but then he got to a point where he
[1:07:34] realized Nothing's Gonna help my child
[1:07:37] unless I let my faith loose amen that my
[1:07:40] faith can take over not my reasoning not
[1:07:43] my worries not my fears but my faith

[1:08:19] grow out of this patch and whatever more

[1:08:25] but he's looking for you to call him on
[1:08:27] the scene that that so God can interrupt
[1:08:30] the situation
[1:08:32] yeah me times to think well they're just
[1:08:33] gonna go that trajectory of life and
[1:08:35] that's it who said
[1:08:37] who said you know faith can turn someone
[1:08:40] around

[1:09:53] at very active Christians here I mean

[1:09:57] they're not sitting in a trench
[1:09:58] somewhere but they're gung-ho they're
[1:10:00] charging forward Hallelujah

[1:10:07] believe there's a you might think I
[1:10:09] don't feel that way about you know
[1:10:11] forget what you feel about yourself you
[1:10:13] know Gideon was hiding threshing weed in
[1:10:16] secret but God said you're a mighty man
[1:10:17] of Allah amen that's what you really are
[1:10:20] my mighty man or woman of faith
[1:10:24] Hallelujah
[1:10:27] praise the lord we can press the battle
[1:10:29] tonight we don't have to be discouraged
[1:10:32] at all
[1:10:33] Hallelujah we can be encouraged you know
[1:10:35] God can God can use our trials to bring
[1:10:38] Deliverance to others that's right amen
[1:10:40] there was a there was a young um there
[1:10:43] was a Hallelujah young sister there at
[1:10:44] the youth can't win Christy and I were
[1:10:46] there in Canada and she couldn't eat
[1:10:48] barely anything since she was just a
[1:10:49] little girl
[1:10:50] you know many things she was free of you
[1:10:52] know free of all kinds of things just
[1:10:54] couldn't eat anything bad
[1:10:56] um tummy cramps and then be okay she'd
[1:10:58] go off one thing and then bet you get
[1:10:59] bad tummy craps to be another thing and
[1:11:01] just there was like no real answer what
[1:11:03] was wrong with her and she came up for
[1:11:05] prayer but then for well before that
[1:11:07] she'd be praying at home because her her
[1:11:09] siblings had made no move towards God at
[1:11:11] all and she is so burdened for them and
[1:11:13] she was you know calling out and asking
[1:11:15] God to touch them and so one night um
[1:11:17] brother Chris at the um Camp you know he
[1:11:20] um he gave an altar call and then so she
[1:11:22] came forward and her siblings came
[1:11:24] forward and they were coming to pray for
[1:11:26] her and she said I'm sick of this I want
[1:11:28] to be able to eat anything this is not
[1:11:30] you know this is not right so so we just
[1:11:32] started or praying for her her siblings
[1:11:33] were praying for her too and she said
[1:11:35] she just felt all the bloating going and
[1:11:37] she said she literally felt hurt
[1:11:38] intestines be rewired and then after
[1:11:42] that she could eat anything and it's
[1:11:44] been over a year she can sell it
[1:11:45] anything but then her siblings came to
[1:11:48] the Lord in those meetings they didn't
[1:11:50] would make any move towards god brother
[1:11:52] they raised their hands praised God they
[1:11:54] were totally her brother she said it's a
[1:11:56] totally different person now
[1:11:58] I mean so many times he can be a
[1:12:00] hardship in life
[1:12:01] but God sure he wants to answer that
[1:12:03] prayer but God uses that to bring others
[1:12:05] in as well because really what's the
[1:12:07] greater blessing eternal life for the
[1:12:09] siblings or now I can eat everything
[1:12:11] yeah but God just goes beyond really
[1:12:14] what we really expect doesn't he isn't
[1:12:16] he wonderful I remember you see what
[1:12:18] happened she turned her faith loose and
[1:12:21] God answered her prayer
[1:12:22] Hallelujah for herself and for her
[1:12:25] siblings I think it's amazing thing
[1:12:27] amazing Hallelujah that but but that's
[1:12:30] what we should do we shouldn't just say
[1:12:31] well I guess this is just how life is
[1:12:33] going to be I saw who said
[1:12:35] amen God has given us so many promises
[1:12:37] in his word I think we should lay hold
[1:12:39] of every single one of them amen and we
[1:12:41] shouldn't Retreat we shouldn't surrender
[1:12:42] we shouldn't give up
[1:12:44] amen we should push the battle why
[1:12:46] because God's given us Faith to subdue
[1:12:48] all things
[1:12:50] Hallelujah
[1:12:53] he sits here in Mark 11 24 therefore I
[1:12:55] said to you what things however ye
[1:12:57] desire When you pray believe that you
[1:13:00] receive them and you shall have them
[1:13:03] amen do you believe when you pray do you
[1:13:05] believe I'm going to receive what I'm
[1:13:06] asking for
[1:13:07] Hallelujah Matthew 18 19 again I say
[1:13:10] unto you that if two of you shall agree
[1:13:12] on Earth as touching anything that yeesh
[1:13:15] that they shall ask it shall be done for
[1:13:18] them of My Father which is in heaven for
[1:13:20] where two or three are gathered together
[1:13:22] in my name there am I in the midst of
[1:13:25] them
[1:13:26] so if two if two
[1:13:29] of you shallow ground Earth touching
[1:13:31] anything anything's everything hey
[1:13:36] amen you think about it oh what can I
[1:13:38] ask for well if it's in here
[1:13:40] and even if it's not in here but it's
[1:13:42] according you know but it doesn't
[1:13:44] contradict the word you can ask for it
[1:13:45] yeah but you've got to be in agreement
[1:13:48] got to be in unison one heart we agree
[1:13:51] together amen God this is my promise
[1:13:54] this is my need
[1:13:57] remember and it doesn't matter what
[1:13:58] state you think you're in see you know
[1:14:00] why does the devil try and push us in
[1:14:02] the picture all the time
[1:14:04] he says yeah but what about you I said
[1:14:06] no but what about our God
[1:14:07] what about the one who redeemed us
[1:14:09] remember he became sin
[1:14:11] did I become the very righteous of God
[1:14:13] in Christ isn't that what the Bible says
[1:14:15] it means it doesn't matter what we are
[1:14:18] going through in our Humanity that's
[1:14:19] actually irrelevant what Covenant has
[1:14:21] God made with you yes sir Hallelujah
[1:14:24] because remember it's just like when you
[1:14:25] know Moses Moses was told by God you
[1:14:28] know if you during a certain battle
[1:14:29] thing against the amalekites or someone
[1:14:31] as long as his hands are up loud win
[1:14:33] that's it right so the so the condition
[1:14:36] of Victory wasn't actually based upon
[1:14:39] how well the soldier of Israel were
[1:14:41] fighting
[1:14:42] it wasn't yeah yeah it wasn't it wasn't
[1:14:45] based on how fit they were how strong
[1:14:46] they were you know how much armor they
[1:14:49] had on how sharp their swords were the
[1:14:51] condition of victory was Moses hands
[1:14:53] were raised amen if his hands were
[1:14:55] raised they were winning if his hands
[1:14:57] went down they were losing now Jesus
[1:14:59] amen because remember this is a sign of
[1:15:01] victory
[1:15:02] Hallelujah said now Moses Moses was a
[1:15:04] type of Christ we understand that amen
[1:15:06] so now when the shadow passed away and
[1:15:08] then now the reality Jesus himself Came
[1:15:10] Upon the scene I mean his hands were
[1:15:12] nailed up
[1:15:13] I mean for an eternal sign of Victory
[1:15:16] amen that everything amen remember it's
[1:15:18] not the condition of the soldier that
[1:15:20] dictates Victory it's the condition of
[1:15:22] the hands of the master amen as his his
[1:15:25] hands were nailed up on Calvary what to
[1:15:28] give us complete Victory I'm in complete
[1:15:30] victory over every enemy not just to win
[1:15:32] half a battle not just to win a bit of a
[1:15:34] battle but to win a battling
[1:15:36] completeness that every enemy is dead
[1:15:38] upon the ground under your feet
[1:15:39] Hallelujah but the condition of Victory
[1:15:42] is not you it's what he has done amen if
[1:15:45] you keep looking to him you'll win if
[1:15:46] you look yourself you'll lose Hallelujah

[1:17:48] if I can remember the amen
[1:17:51] let's go to Second Corinthians 4.
[1:17:54] and then we'll just finish with it
[1:18:00] he said so this is second Corinthians
[1:18:01] four and seven I didn't want to be long
[1:18:03] tonight
[1:18:04] we're full of faith
[1:18:07] follow the Holy Ghost you're full of
[1:18:09] faith

[1:18:12] full of faith
[1:18:14] Hallelujah
[1:18:18] repeat after me I'm full of faith
[1:18:20] because the Lord's in me
[1:18:23] I'm more than an overcomer
[1:18:25] through Christ that strengthens me
[1:18:28] do you feel better after saying that see
[1:18:31] see we believe therefore we speak right
[1:18:34] so if you believe it you should confess
[1:18:36] it
[1:18:38] now
[1:18:40] but we have this treasure in Earthen
[1:18:41] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:18:44] may be of God and not of uh and not of
[1:18:46] us we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:18:49] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:18:51] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:18:54] down but not destroyed always bearing
[1:18:56] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[1:18:58] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[1:19:00] be made manifest in our body
[1:19:02] the way which liver always delivered
[1:19:05] unto death for Jesus sake that the life
[1:19:07] also of Jesus might be made manifested
[1:19:09] our mortal flesh so then death worketh
[1:19:12] in us but life in you we have the same
[1:19:15] Spirit of Faith according it as it is
[1:19:17] written I believed and therefore have I
[1:19:20] spoken we also believe and therefore
[1:19:22] speak that's why it's so important if
[1:19:24] you believe the word speak the word amen
[1:19:27] you're feeling down you're questioning
[1:19:29] your Christian walk take every promise
[1:19:31] of God what God has made you and speak
[1:19:33] it
[1:19:35] amen well where to start take it take
[1:19:38] the book of Ephesians and change the us
[1:19:41] and we to me and I
[1:19:43] am and quote it either you're going to
[1:19:45] stand in the mirror and quote it to
[1:19:46] yourself yeah you'll find things will
[1:19:48] change gloominess will leave unbelief
[1:19:51] will go because while you're quoting the
[1:19:53] promises of God that God has made to you
[1:19:55] amen it's not just anyone else it's to
[1:19:57] you he's made the promises amen he died
[1:19:59] that you'd receive every Redemptive
[1:20:01] blessing in this book
[1:20:03] Hallelujah that you would receive it oh
[1:20:06] what do I have to do to earn it no you
[1:20:08] just got to receive it well how do you
[1:20:10] receive it you just choose to believe it
[1:20:11] it starts with a decision say what he
[1:20:14] said is about me amen thank you Lord
[1:20:16] amen
[1:20:17] doesn't have to be a big
[1:20:19] Thunderbolt lightning time you just
[1:20:21] choose and you might ah this is mine
[1:20:24] I believe it now
[1:20:26] and we having the same Spirit I'm just
[1:20:28] going to repeat that verse 13 and we're
[1:20:30] having the same Spirit of Faith
[1:20:32] according as is written I believe and
[1:20:35] therefore have I spoken we also believe
[1:20:36] and therefore speak knowing that he
[1:20:38] which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[1:20:40] raise us also by Jesus and shall present
[1:20:44] us with you for all things are for your
[1:20:46] sakes at the abundant grace might uh
[1:20:48] might through the Thanksgiving of many
[1:20:50] rebound to the glory of God for which
[1:20:53] cause we faint not for thou outward man
[1:20:55] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[1:20:57] by day for our light affliction
[1:21:00] yeah every trial in life falls under
[1:21:03] this category
[1:21:05] I'm not I'm not downplaying what
[1:21:07] anyone's going through but this is the
[1:21:10] category heading it goes under light
[1:21:12] affliction
[1:21:14] now let's see the expiry date of this
[1:21:16] thing which is but for a moment
[1:21:18] I like that a moment
[1:21:21] worketh for us oh it's doing something
[1:21:25] worker for us are far more exceeding and
[1:21:27] eternal weight of Glory see faith can

[1:21:43] a trial
[1:21:45] hey man amen praise God so whatever
[1:21:47] trials you have put it under this
[1:21:49] category and say let's do it this is

[1:22:04] to make the word personal working for me
[1:22:06] are far more exceeding and eternal
[1:22:07] weight of Glory while we not look at
[1:22:10] while we look not at things which are
[1:22:12] seen but things which in are not seen
[1:22:14] for the things which are seen are
