[9:14] service, um, Brother Kaben and Brother
[9:16] Ed are going to take up an offering for

[9:25] Amen. So, let's stand. Let's dedicate
[9:28] our lives to the Lord again. And I'm so
[9:31] I'm [music] excited.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus is going to come by our way again.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You think about it. He's a
[9:37] sovereign God. He chooses to come. Amen.
[9:40] So, I'm so thankful he takes up our
[9:41] invitation, visits us, and [music]
[9:43] Amen. So, let's bow our heads and let's
[9:45] just dedicate our lives to this service.
[9:47] Amen. Let's pray. Gracious Father, oh
[9:50] Lord, we're so thankful, Lord. The tomb
[9:52] is empty, Lord. The stone's been rolled
[9:55] away. You're alive, Lord, and you're
[9:57] alive in 2025. And this morning, as we
[10:00] dedicate our lives, we dedicate this
[10:02] service, oh God. God, we pray once again
[10:05] you'd come among us, Lord, touch our
[10:07] lives. We invite you to where we are
[10:09] this morning. Speak to us all
[10:10] personally. I pray, Father, that Lord,
[10:13] you'd anoint brother John once again,
[10:14] Lord. May you just be such an uncction
[10:16] of your Holy Ghost, Lord, speaking to
[10:18] our lives, Lord Jesus. May you take
[10:20] complete control of the service. I pray
[10:22] you'd anoint us all, Father. May we just
[10:25] be under your under the great shadow of
[10:26] your wings once again, Lord, covered in
[10:28] your blood, Father. I pray you'd have
[10:30] preeminence, Lord. That every spirit
[10:32] that's not of you be bound in the name
[10:33] of Jesus Christ. May you feel so
[10:35] welcome, Lord. We don't want you in the
[10:37] corner with unwashed feet, Lord, this
[10:39] morning. Want you as the head, Lord, the
[10:41] highest place in this, Lord, in this
[10:43] room, dear God. May you be king over
[10:45] all, Lord. Father, we want to make you
[10:47] welcome this morning. We love you so
[10:49] much. We pray you just have your way in
[10:51] Jesus Christ's name. May you be with us
[10:53] here also. Those who are streaming,
[10:54] Lord, be their abundant portion, Lord.
[10:56] We love you and we thank you in Jesus
[10:58] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[11:01] you.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Good morning.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Are you happy?
[11:13] The first song we're going to sing is
[11:14] this one.
[11:16] You asked me why I'm happy. So, I'll
[11:18] just tell you why.
[11:20] Because my sins are gone. I'd like
[11:22] someone to tell me what a greater thing
[11:24] you could have in your life outside of
[11:26] your sins being gone.
[11:30] Therefore, it shall make you the most
[11:32] happy. So, I can't think of anything
[11:34] more valuable than that. The fact that
[11:36] all of our sins are gone.
[11:38] Take everything else, but just take away
[11:40] that. I'm good. Take away my sins, Lord,
[11:43] I'm good. Do whatever else you want to
[11:45] me in my life or whatever. Just do that
[11:46] for me. I'm good. Which he has. Amen. We
[11:50] got Latabo on the piano this morning and
[11:52] she plays really nice like a little. So,
[11:55] she's going to start the song. This is
[11:57] Latabo.
[11:59] [laughter]
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Say everyone say good morning. Latabo
[12:31] You ask me why. Well, you ask me why I'm
[12:35] happy. And I'll just tell you why.
[12:39] Because [music]
[12:42] my sins are gone.
[12:45] And when I meet the scoffers [music] who
[12:49] ask me where they are, I say [music]
[12:54] my sins are gone there underneath.
[12:57] There underneath the blood on the cross
[13:01] of Calvary. [music and singing]
[13:03] They're as far removed as darkness from

[14:26] Jesus [music]
[14:27] got me out.

[16:34] Well,

[21:07] Amen. You can take your seats this
[21:09] morning.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; I noticed there's quite a few more
[21:12] people here. So the brother Kubin's sort
[21:15] of squeezing everyone in. You realize
[21:18] that all the brothers on the front row
[21:20] get called up for all the examples. You
[21:21] know say come up here brother.
[21:23] [laughter]
[21:24] You too brother. So be ready.
[21:29] That's why nobody sits there
[21:34] except Dave. Dave's got courage.
[21:40] Um, [applause]
[21:42] so we've got a special this morning. We
[21:43] just got one special um from Brother
[21:45] Onius. Where is he?
[21:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come up here, brother.
[22:15] Someone play.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; It's not that you don't play well. The
[22:27] tabbo.
[22:34] We'll find a time where we'll sing and
[22:37] you play.
[22:42] I want to greet you all in the wonderful
[22:44] name of the Lord. Amen.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; This time I see sister Naomi, we think
[22:48] of music. The first time we sang
[22:51] together years ago, I said, "Sister, can
[22:54] you do you know this song? Can you beg
[22:57] me?" And you said, "Uh, there's a piano
[23:01] out there. Let's go right now.
[23:04] So we went there. I haven't seen you for
[23:06] years. So when I saw yesterday, the
[23:09] first thing I thought, you think you can
[23:11] play this song? Said there's a piano
[23:13] right there.
[23:15] Let's go out there. So one day I plan to
[23:18] visit you down in South Island.
[23:21] I'll carry my rifle to hand with brother
[23:24] Matthew.
[23:25] You got guitars there? Your place?
[23:29] I'm sure I got a piano, but do you have
[23:31] a guitar? Okay. So, I don't need to get
[23:34] a guitar.
[23:36] When I come over there, we say, "Okay,
[23:38] sister, we going to really sing." All
[23:40] right. I want to teach you all the songs
[23:43] I know and you teach me all the songs
[23:47] you know. So, it's going to take some
[23:49] time. Might take us some days.
[23:55] Right. Just before I sing, I don't
[23:56] intend to take your time, but just feel
[23:59] like saying this.
[24:02] There was this man. He was traveling
[24:05] somewhere. It was in a forest. Quite a
[24:08] wild forest,
[24:10] right? The mountain. The sides are steep
[24:13] on this side, steep on that side. On the
[24:16] path that he was walking on, suddenly he
[24:19] saw this very large snake. You know
[24:22] those snakes in the Brazilian jungle,
[24:25] the anacondas
[24:27] right there. That was really a thick
[24:31] snake. So he's trying to go that way and
[24:34] the anal cond is laying right there
[24:36] looking at him. Now he has to go
[24:39] through. That's the path. But it's
[24:41] laying right there. If I go back home, I
[24:44] can't go back home. I got to go through
[24:46] there. But that anaconda is waiting to
[24:49] swallow me. So what do I do?
[24:53] So you can start screaming.
[24:55] You can start jumping. is not going to
[24:57] solve the situation because the anaconda
[25:00] is still there. Then while he was
[25:03] worrying all about it, oh, what's that
[25:06] snake doing there? What do I do? It's
[25:08] going to eat me. It's going to do this.
[25:10] It's going to, you know, a small bed
[25:14] just flew from the sky
[25:17] and landed on that big snake.
[25:21] And he started
[25:23] pecking this snake's eyes. And this neck
[25:26] never moved. And this man said, "What's
[25:30] happening here? I'm afraid of this
[25:33] thing.
[25:34] And this little bed is pecking it. The
[25:37] eyes are sensitive."
[25:39] That's when he realized the snake was
[25:41] dead all along.
[25:45] He was afraid of a death snake. Yes, it
[25:49] was big. He could see it was big. It
[25:51] wasn't moving.
[25:53] So he thought it was waiting to swallow
[25:55] him whole. But it took God to send a
[25:58] little bed to show him, look, this
[26:00] little bed is not afraid of that big
[26:03] snake. But you are afraid of that big
[26:06] snake.
[26:07] So why I'm singing this choruses here?
[26:10] Just an encouragement to someone
[26:13] that situation you are in today. Just
[26:16] start singing.
[26:18] Just start singing. Refuse to see the
[26:21] anaconda is dead.
[26:23] is dead. The Christian walk is sometimes
[26:27] get really hard. But have you tried
[26:30] singing, sister? Have you tried singing?
[26:34] Have you tried singing, brother? Give it
[26:37] a try. Give it a try. And you find out
[26:40] that snake was dead all along.
[26:43] And I have KG.
[26:46] We just sing it normally. Won't we won't
[26:48] make it worship. Just sing it. Sing it.
[26:52] just speak.
[26:55] You'll sing it no more. Okay.
[27:00] Down on my knees, [music]
[27:05] I found [singing] my Jesus.
[27:10] Down on my knees,
[27:14] I saw the Lord. [music]

[32:19] &gt;&gt; You singing solo?
[32:21] &gt;&gt; You
[32:23] not as good as you.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Can't sing
[32:27] [laughter]
[32:33] at this rate. That'll be part of the
[32:35] special
[32:41] one. Two.
[32:51] Amen.
[32:53] Um, I just wanted to probably just take
[32:55] this moment to greet you all. And I
[32:58] think it's just appropriate that we
[33:00] thank the host pastor and his family and
[33:02] the church for their hospitality
[33:06] and the meetings and just being here. So
[33:09] on behalf of us and uh mom and dad uh I
[33:14] should say pastor and our pastor and his
[33:16] wife who wanted to express our
[33:18] appreciation and say thank you and say
[33:21] God bless you. And uh we we've got
[33:25] brother Isaac and you singing with us?
[33:30] Give givea You got to give Isaac a hand.
[33:32] Hey, give him a hand. [applause]
[33:37] &gt;&gt; And I I I I wanted to publicly tell him
[33:40] Shakina Tabernacle. They got it this
[33:42] year.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; All right. They got it this year. So I
[33:45] want to say we appreciate you. Thank you
[33:46] for the food and uh the fellowship. And
[33:49] uh I um you know the benefits of being a
[33:52] of your p your father being a pastor is
[33:54] we uh we landed in the villa you know on
[33:57] the on the waterfront. We've got a
[33:59] beachside view and a villa and we walked
[34:02] in there and there was a gift basket and
[34:05] I saw a tie and I told I said that's my
[34:07] tie and cufflinks and when we opened the
[34:10] fridge there was drinks in there. So
[34:12] being a PK's kid there's a few benefits
[34:14] now and then. So I wanted to say thank
[34:16] you to brother Ben and sister Christine
[34:18] and brother Kuben at the back there and
[34:19] the believers. Thank you very much. So

[52:17] We really enjoyed last night's service.
[52:19] Did you enjoy last night's service? My
[52:22] thank you. [applause] My [cheering]
[52:24] thank you, brother Jonathan. Ah, now
[52:27] that that's some real preaching.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; That's some ministry right there. I I I
[52:33] just sit there and think, what am I
[52:35] doing here? I heard brother Daryl Ward
[52:38] was coming to the South Island and
[52:40] Christ Church to their kind. I said,
[52:41] "What does New Zealand need me for? They
[52:43] don't need me." And then after last
[52:46] night, I felt like crawling under a
[52:48] carpet or something. I'm like, "My
[52:50] goodness,
[52:51] what do I have to say?" God bless you,
[52:54] Brother Jonathan. Amen. That was
[52:56] fantastic.
[52:57] Amen. Well, we want to bring you
[52:59] greetings from our our little church and
[53:01] and greetings to the saints uh in New
[53:04] Zealand. To the saints that are in uh
[53:06] New Zealand. Sounds like we're reading
[53:08] the Bible.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; And uh this is our little church again.
[53:13] We opened four years ago. Next Sunday be
[53:16] our end of four uh four four years now.
[53:19] We're going into our anniversary
[53:20] services. And we started in the uh
[53:23] building on the top, a community center,
[53:25] and then the Lord gave us a place that
[53:27] we can rent. I I wanted to show you and
[53:30] greet our greet you from our family. And
[53:34] uh we have three children and six
[53:36] grandchildren
[53:37] uh two boys and a and a girl and their
[53:41] children. And we just are thankful to
[53:43] the Lord.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Well, how are the sheep doing today?
[53:49] &gt;&gt; I missed these yesterday. I bypassed
[53:51] them and I I don't know how I missed you
[53:53] but lambs and the sheep but uh I just
[53:56] pray that we would become like this.
[53:58] Amen.
[54:01] Hallelujah. Our mouths wide open. Our
[54:03] hearts are open. We love the word.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; My the Lord has done great things in New
[54:08] Zealand.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Years ago
[54:12] my wife was um in New New Zealand. She
[54:16] had born and raised in the message. Her
[54:18] father's a pastor in Australia and she
[54:20] came here for some meetings at the end
[54:23] of December and she's 18 years old and a
[54:28] couple ministers were preaching and and
[54:30] she gave her heart to the Lord and and
[54:33] it was so wonderful. She went back to
[54:34] Australia for some time and then came
[54:37] back here and she started visiting
[54:41] a lot of the message churches here in
[54:43] New Zealand. And at that time,
[54:46] this is a long time ago. This is like 33
[54:48] years ago. Well, we've been married 33
[54:51] years, 34 years. And what was so
[54:54] disappointing to her was is there was
[54:56] just a lot of fighting going on in the
[54:59] churches and this church against that
[55:01] church and this church against that
[55:03] church. And it was so disappointing and
[55:05] so discouraging to her as a young uh
[55:08] Christian that had given her heart to
[55:10] the Lord. I think sister
[55:13] um Martin experienced that also in her
[55:16] area there. And so it's not just in New
[55:18] Zealand but other places. And so before
[55:21] we get in to our sermon this morning,
[55:23] we're we're speaking on no civil war.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; No civil war.
[55:29] And and I just wanted to say that um
[55:32] young believers
[55:35] uh cringe when there's fighting going
[55:38] on,
[55:39] &gt;&gt; when there's a lot of church fusses and
[55:42] church feuds going on and and church
[55:45] politics, it will drive your youth into
[55:48] the world.
[55:50] And so this morning is going to be just
[55:52] a little bit of uh a warning, but also
[55:56] just some words of instruction
[55:58] to you, my fellow brothers and sisters.
[56:01] Just some wisdom of the Holy Spirit and
[56:05] all of the things that go on since the
[56:07] Lord's called us to serve him in in the
[56:10] light of this message. And it's but if
[56:13] we're not careful, coldness can come in.
[56:16] I know I'm speaking here on the Sunday
[56:18] morning after a wonderful meetings and
[56:21] times, but we can't live at family camp.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; We've got to go back Monday, Tuesday. We
[56:27] got to go back to our lives.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; And these are mountaintop experiences
[56:32] and really some of the best times of our
[56:34] whole lives. And but I just want to say
[56:37] this that if it gets to where it's
[56:40] becomes stale and formal and indifferent
[56:43] starts moving into our churches that
[56:45] will quench the Holy Spirit.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; In fact, Paul said quench not the Holy
[56:50] Spirit.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And so a person can actually have the
[56:54] Holy Spirit and quench him.
[56:58] And so just remember that that a lot of
[57:01] church wrecks and things have happened
[57:03] and family
[57:05] have broken up and relationships have
[57:07] been broken because of a lack of love.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; And if you'd like to just write that
[57:13] down or in your heart, a lack of love. I
[57:15] was look looking at what brother
[57:16] Brandham said this morning about lack of
[57:18] love. Lack of love. It'll it'll it'll
[57:20] drive Christ right out of our midst when
[57:23] we can talk about it, sing about it. But
[57:27] we really don't have the depth of what
[57:30] it really is.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; And even brother Brandham, do you
[57:34] remember when he crossed over and had
[57:36] that experience of seeing his first wife
[57:38] and and she said and then he came she
[57:41] came back into the room and was patting
[57:43] him on the shoulder and said, "Don't
[57:45] worry about us."
[57:47] &gt;&gt; She had passed away and Sharon and his
[57:49] daughter and and don't worry about us.
[57:52] Don't worry about us. and he's p she's
[57:54] patting him in the room and and you've
[57:58] sung about it, you've talked about it,
[58:00] you've preached about it, but you really
[58:01] don't know what it is. And he said,
[58:03] "What are you talking about? Heaven."
[58:06] So if a prophet can preach about it and
[58:09] we can sing about it and talk about it
[58:11] and we really don't know what it is, is
[58:13] it possible that we that we can talk
[58:15] about love? We can hear messages on
[58:17] love. And I I really feel it's got to
[58:20] come from behind the pulpit, too. If if
[58:22] our ministry become where we're arrogant
[58:25] and proudful and we're the only ones
[58:28] that's got it and you know we've got the
[58:30] great revelations and and we start
[58:32] talking down the you know the the little
[58:34] church over here or that church over
[58:36] there and you know we're we're the big
[58:38] you know we're the mega church and we're
[58:40] the church in New Zealand that's got the
[58:41] deepest revelation. That kind of
[58:43] rhetoric will drive the Holy Spirit away
[58:46] because God is in the church in the
[58:48] mission.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; He's in the youth group. if he's with
[58:51] the young ladies and young girls today
[58:53] that might might go back and not even
[58:55] have a friend.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; In our prayer meeting this morning with
[59:00] the brothers or yesterday, there was one
[59:02] person that expressed that they're the
[59:04] only ones in their family that are
[59:06] believers.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Then it's important at times like this
[59:09] that we have love one for the other and
[59:13] and not just talk about it, but people
[59:15] can sense whether you love them or not.
[59:19] That's true.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; And if we're trying to win the world for
[59:23] Christ and we can't even win one
[59:24] another, we're missing something.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; If we're trying to win people to receive
[59:30] the message and yet we can't even love
[59:32] one another, we're missing it.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; We can talk about it and sing about it,
[59:38] hear great messages preached about it,
[59:40] but I want it in reality. Who wants it
[59:43] in reality today?
[59:46] So, I just had those comments to say
[59:48] about that and receiving the Holy Ghost
[59:51] and and being born again is a good
[59:54] start, but your adoption is your placing
[59:58] &gt;&gt; and that's the maturity.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; And so, I I can sense in New Zealand,
[1:00:03] God's done great things in your lives
[1:00:05] and giving you great revelation. And
[1:00:08] we're all in a process of in our of
[1:00:10] receiving the Lord and being justified,
[1:00:13] being sanctified, being filled with his
[1:00:15] spirit. But we must go all the way to
[1:00:18] our maturity. And that is your adoption
[1:00:21] is when the word begins to grow through
[1:00:25] you. Christ grows through you and he can
[1:00:28] see in your life that you have the
[1:00:30] character
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; to be able to reflect his word.
[1:00:37] And so be before I have you stand, I I
[1:00:39] wanted to say that the Lord wants us to
[1:00:42] use the sword of his spirit against the
[1:00:45] enemy.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; And often times as believers, we can
[1:00:50] become so aggressive and so zealous in
[1:00:53] our terminology that we begin to fight
[1:00:56] one another.
[1:00:57] We actually take the sword of the spirit
[1:01:00] and the word and begin to oppose and
[1:01:03] react and respond in a way that's not
[1:01:06] the nature of Christ. And the Holy
[1:01:08] Spirit in a service like this is just
[1:01:10] putting up a warning flag, a stop sign
[1:01:12] or a yield sign or just just maybe you
[1:01:16] need to just look at it another way. YOU
[1:01:19] CAN BE TOTALLY RIGHT IN YOUR DOCTRINE,
[1:01:21] but if you're wrong in your spirit,
[1:01:24] something's not right. And we can drive
[1:01:27] one another away from the Lord.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; We can offend our children
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; and lose a whole generation in the
[1:01:40] message
[1:01:42] when THEY HEAR HOW GREAT OUR GOD IS AND
[1:01:44] HOW WONDERFUL a message has come and we
[1:01:47] go back home and fight
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; and have strife
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; and war.
[1:01:54] Today the Holy Spirit is calling an end
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; to that kind of war.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; No civil war.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; So God bless you. Let's stand together
[1:02:06] again before we read. I'd like us to lay
[1:02:09] hands on one another and just reach
[1:02:11] across to that sister, that brother,
[1:02:13] please.
[1:02:15] And let's just pray that the Lord will
[1:02:16] give us strength and patience as we
[1:02:20] are hearing his word. Even our little
[1:02:22] children and our babies could just be
[1:02:24] calm today. And
[1:02:27] our dear heavenly father,
[1:02:30] lift up your hands over this
[1:02:32] congregation.
[1:02:35] Lift up your spirit of healing in the
[1:02:38] name of Jesus. May we be healed.
[1:02:41] You said in your word, "If my people
[1:02:43] that are called by my name will humble
[1:02:46] themselves and pray and look to that
[1:02:49] place that you will forgive them of
[1:02:52] their sins and you will heal their land.
[1:02:55] Heal our land, Lord. Deliver us from
[1:02:58] evil. Fill us with THE HOLY SPIRIT. CAP
[1:03:02] OFF OUR LIVES WITH THIS GREAT capstone
[1:03:04] of perfect love.
[1:03:07] scatter away ALL THE DARKNESS AND ALL
[1:03:09] THE EVIL, all the demon SPIRITS THAT
[1:03:12] MAYBE WE'VE catered to or been uh
[1:03:15] negligent of. Maybe we've been
[1:03:17] negligent, Lord, and not mindful of our
[1:03:21] character and how with it we are. Maybe
[1:03:24] we are offending someone, our spouse or
[1:03:27] our children. Maybe there's someone in
[1:03:29] the church that we could be more of the
[1:03:31] nature of Christ to. Lord, we lay hands
[1:03:34] on our brothers and our sisters.
[1:03:36] believing that demon spirits are cast
[1:03:38] out, our very hands laid on one another,
[1:03:41] we can bring healing, our very shadow
[1:03:44] over our loved ones.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus, may every heart
[1:03:49] here today be filled with the Holy
[1:03:52] Ghost.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; I thank you for the word that we heard.
[1:03:56] I thank you for the quality of the
[1:03:58] ministry. I thank you for the character
[1:04:00] of the New Zealand bride that is now
[1:04:03] coming to a capstone. Bless them Lord
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; on this Sunday morning. I bless them in
[1:04:09] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; May their babies and their children and
[1:04:14] their teenagers, their offspring with
[1:04:16] them be there on that great day.
[1:04:19] Hallelujah. WHEN THE BLUE GRASS IS
[1:04:21] BLOWING in the wind, let these brothers
[1:04:23] and sisters come running over the
[1:04:26] mountain HAND IN HAND, SHOULDERTOSH
[1:04:29] SHOULDER, SAY, "WE MADE IT BY THE GRACE
[1:04:31] OF GOD."
[1:04:32] YOUR MERCIES are new every morning. BE
[1:04:35] NEW TODAY, LORD. CLEAR AWAY THE FOG of
[1:04:39] war. AND MAY THE HOLY SPIRIT, LORD, DROP
[1:04:42] DOWN INTO THE SOUL REALM. Come into our
[1:04:45] spirit. BRING BACK, LORD, A SISTER
[1:04:48] THAT'S WANDERED IN HER MIND. Oh
[1:04:50] Margaret, oh Margaret, COME BACK TO
[1:04:53] YOURSELF TODAY. OH BROTHER, OH SISTER,
[1:04:56] COME BACK TO THE MIND OF Christ
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; and heal our bodies. I pray in Jesus
[1:05:01] name.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; IN JESUS NAME.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And the church said
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's turn to the
[1:05:10] scripture in 2 Samuel chapter 2.
[1:05:15] And I thank you for your patience. I
[1:05:17] thank you for your kind attention as we
[1:05:20] come into this. I'm aware of our
[1:05:22] lunchtime
[1:05:24] schedule
[1:05:26] and um this is something been on our
[1:05:28] hearts and I wanted to bring it to you
[1:05:31] as one of your friends, one of your
[1:05:35] fellow uh servants,
[1:05:39] just washing your feet with our tears
[1:05:41] and
[1:05:44] knowing that our time is short and the
[1:05:47] days are evil. I just pray for the next
[1:05:49] few minutes, the Lord would season our
[1:05:51] words with his oil because we might need
[1:05:54] it. And if I say things that are uh
[1:05:57] clear and not between the lines, I just
[1:06:01] pray that God will give you grace to
[1:06:02] receive it and me grace to say it.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; I was in prayer today on my knees and I
[1:06:09] was Lord, if I say that, if I do that,
[1:06:14] so just be in prayer today before we go
[1:06:16] to lunch.
[1:06:18] 2 Samuel chapter 2 was a time in the
[1:06:21] message David had now come
[1:06:25] to be the king of Judah
[1:06:29] and Jonathan and Saul had died in the
[1:06:32] battle.
[1:06:35] And we're going to be just
[1:06:38] soaking in the nature of Christ this
[1:06:40] morning.
[1:06:42] Just watch his attitude. Watch his
[1:06:44] spirit. And then things begin to happen
[1:06:46] in the message.
[1:06:49] Chapter 2 11, David was king in Hebron
[1:06:53] for 7 years and 6 months.
[1:06:56] But then verse 12, we see that Abner
[1:07:03] Abner was
[1:07:06] the the general for Saul's army. Saul
[1:07:09] was the king of Israel. And now it was
[1:07:11] King Ishbath was the king. And Joab was
[1:07:15] under King David.
[1:07:18] And we find in verse 12 that Abnner
[1:07:22] came to this place in verse 13 and Joab.
[1:07:26] So Abnner was the the leader or the
[1:07:29] general
[1:07:30] for Saul's army. And David, David's
[1:07:33] leader in verse 13 was Joab. And and
[1:07:36] they went out and met together by the
[1:07:39] pool of Gibian. and they sat down and
[1:07:41] one on the one side of the pool and the
[1:07:44] other on the other side of the pool.
[1:07:47] We're just going to have some good
[1:07:48] Christian message fellowship.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; But in verse 14, what happened? Abner
[1:07:54] said to Joab, "Let the young men now
[1:07:57] arise and play before us."
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; And Joab said, "Let them arise." This,
[1:08:04] in other words, they said, "Let's have
[1:08:06] some war games. Let's let them sport."
[1:08:10] And the moment you bring your young
[1:08:12] people into the fight, you've lost.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And they pulled their young people in to
[1:08:20] this war game. Verse 15. And there arose
[1:08:23] and went by number. So 12 of Benjamin
[1:08:27] and which pertained to one side and 12
[1:08:31] of the servants of David. So now we have
[1:08:33] 24 young people in the message. 12 on
[1:08:36] one side. Verse 16. And they caught one.
[1:08:39] everyone his fellow by the head and
[1:08:41] thrust his sword to his fellow side. So
[1:08:44] they fell down together.
[1:08:51] Now that's when anybody in their right
[1:08:54] mind SHOULD HAVE SAID, "STOP IT."
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; WE GOT 12 YOUNG PEOPLE ON one side, 12
[1:08:59] in on another. WE'RE IN THE MESSAGE.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; That's when ANY GODLY MOTHER SHOULD HAVE
[1:09:04] SAID, "I DIDN'T RAISE MY SON for this.
[1:09:08] But you look down through the next few
[1:09:10] verses, what happened? Just skip down to
[1:09:12] verse 26.
[1:09:15] And Abner called to Joab and said,
[1:09:17] "Shall the sword devour forever?
[1:09:20] Knowest thou not that it will be
[1:09:22] bitterness to the latter end? How long
[1:09:25] shall it be then, heir thou bid the
[1:09:28] people return from following their
[1:09:30] brethren?"
[1:09:31] And Joab said, "As the Lord liveth,
[1:09:34] unless thou had spoken, surely then in
[1:09:36] the morning the people had gone up
[1:09:38] everyone from following his brethren."
[1:09:41] So Joab blew a trumpet
[1:09:44] cuz there was a civil war going on.
[1:09:46] They're killing one another in the
[1:09:48] message.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; And Joab blew a trumpet and all the
[1:09:52] people stood still and pursued after
[1:09:56] Israel no more, neither fought they
[1:09:59] anymore.
[1:10:01] And you look down through these next few
[1:10:04] verses, verse 30, Joab returned from
[1:10:07] following Amnner. And when he had
[1:10:09] gathered all the people together, their
[1:10:10] lack of David's servants, 19 men, and
[1:10:13] Ashel, we skipped those verses, but
[1:10:16] Ashel was a relative of Joab. And it's
[1:10:18] going to come back to hurt Abner because
[1:10:21] he died. So there was 19 or 20 that died
[1:10:24] on one side. Verse 31. And the servants
[1:10:27] of David had smitten of Benjamin and
[1:10:29] Abnner's men. So they had 303 score 360
[1:10:34] people died on one side.
[1:10:38] Chapter 3 verse 1
[1:10:41] speaking this morning on no civil war.
[1:10:44] The Bible says there was long war
[1:10:46] between the house of Saul and the house
[1:10:49] of David.
[1:10:50] I thought we were supposed to be all in
[1:10:52] the same message. Long war.
[1:10:56] Verse six. And it came to pass while
[1:10:58] there was war between the house of Saul
[1:11:00] and the house of David that Abnner made
[1:11:03] himself strong. And it goes on to talk
[1:11:05] about these things. God bless you. You
[1:11:07] can have your seats today.
[1:11:13] Are you ready to hear the word? Yeah,
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said, "We can scream
[1:11:18] and shout or do whatever we want to, and
[1:11:21] it'll never influence men until they see
[1:11:24] the life of Christ being projected in
[1:11:27] you."
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Someone who is tender and merciful and
[1:11:31] forgiving and ready to turn the other
[1:11:33] side of the cheek or give the second
[1:11:36] coat or go the second mile. Christianity
[1:11:40] in action.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; How many want to be a real Christian?
[1:11:44] Yes.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY'S THANKFUL FOR THE MESSAGE GOD
[1:11:47] sent in this day?
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; How many KNOW THE MESSAGE IS CHRIST?
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Are we getting people to Christ?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; ARE WE GETTING ONE ANOTHER TO CHRIST? Do
[1:11:59] others see Jesus in you?
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Not just taught from the pulpit,
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; but acted among the members, among the
[1:12:10] pastors. That's when you see Christ
[1:12:13] living in the church and decisions are
[1:12:16] made. We could scream and SHOUT OR DO
[1:12:19] WHATEVER WE want to. It'll never
[1:12:21] influence men until they see the life of
[1:12:24] Christ being projected in you.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; I want others to see Christ in me.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; We've been born and raised in the
[1:12:32] message. We've been born in the fire and
[1:12:35] we don't want the smoke.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; We don't want the fog of war. And the
[1:12:41] fog of war is when people on the same
[1:12:43] side start killing one another.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHEN THE THE BATTLE GETS TOUGH AND
[1:12:48] THE SWEAT COMES DOWN INTO YOUR EYES and
[1:12:50] you're and and there's men and women
[1:12:52] AROUND YOU THAT ARE dying and young
[1:12:55] people and people that you've been
[1:12:56] raised with and people that is maybe
[1:12:58] going to the world or families that are
[1:13:01] struggling. IT CAN PUT A CERTAIN TYPE OF
[1:13:04] SPIRIT AMONG US EVEN IN New Zealand
[1:13:06] WHERE WE START TO FIGHT ONE another
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; and we start to war one another. In 2
[1:13:13] Samuel 12 verse 10, this is Nathan the
[1:13:17] prophet prophesying to David. He said,
[1:13:20] "The sword shall never depart from thine
[1:13:23] house." Amen.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; In 1 Coronicles 28:3,
[1:13:29] this is God speaking to David because
[1:13:32] now it had come to the end of David's
[1:13:34] ministry and there was a transition into
[1:13:37] the new generation. And how many can
[1:13:39] recognize that you in New Zealand are in
[1:13:42] another season?
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Times have changed.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Seasons have changed. AND YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:13:51] RESPOND APPROPRIATELY in the season
[1:13:53] you're in.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And here WE ARE IN 1 CORONICLES 28:3.
[1:14:00] God speaking to David. I'm trying to
[1:14:02] move along. Thou shalt not build an
[1:14:04] house for my name because thou hast been
[1:14:07] a man of war and hast shed blood.
[1:14:11] A man of war is warlike. That's in their
[1:14:14] disposition. That's in their
[1:14:15] countenance. Have you ever looked into
[1:14:17] the face of someone and you can just see
[1:14:20] that they're upset?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; You can look into the eyes of a person
[1:14:24] and tell a lot about that person. You
[1:14:26] can often times look into a into the
[1:14:28] eyes of a person and tell whether
[1:14:30] they're in distress,
[1:14:32] whether they're whether they're fight or
[1:14:35] a flight mode. AND SOMETIMES AS
[1:14:37] BELIEVERS, we can get into that mode. I
[1:14:39] know we're in camp today and
[1:14:41] everything's good, BUT WE'RE GOING INTO
[1:14:43] A BATTLE THIS WEEK. AND THERE'S TIMES
[1:14:45] WHEN WE WANT WHEN WE HAVE WE FEEL LIKE
[1:14:47] FIGHTING and there's times we feel like
[1:14:49] fighting
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; and it's not wrong to FIGHT AND IT'S NOT
[1:14:53] WRONG TO RUN. You know, you know,
[1:14:55] remember Joseph got out of that place.
[1:14:57] But it's finding the mind of the Lord
[1:14:59] for that season. Yes.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Remember in modern events made clear by
[1:15:07] prophecy 1965, brother Bradom said it
[1:15:10] was Jesus Christ in David.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; It was Christ in Noah, Christ in Moses,
[1:15:17] Christ in Joseph. IT'S JESUS CHRIST
[1:15:20] AMONG his people today.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; How many WOULD SAY THAT'S WHAT WE WANT
[1:15:25] TO SEE MORE IS MORE OF JESUS in our
[1:15:27] lives?
[1:15:29] BUT WHEN DAVID COMMITTED ADULTERY WITH
[1:15:31] BASHEBA, THAT WAS NOT CHRIST in David.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE PROPHET CALLED OUT THOSE
[1:15:37] SHEBEARS AND KILLED TH THOSE YOUNG
[1:15:40] PEOPLE, THAT WAS NOT CHRIST IN THE
[1:15:42] PROPHET. So there's SEASONS OF OUR LIVES
[1:15:44] THAT WE CAN SAY THAT'S CHRIST IN ME.
[1:15:47] THAT'S CHRIST IN THE CHURCH. THAT'S
[1:15:49] CHRIST IN THE MINISTRY. BUT WHETHER YOU
[1:15:51] WANT TO ADMIT IT OR NOT, WE ALL HAVE THE
[1:15:53] HINDER PARTS.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; WE ALL HAVE WEAKNESSES.
[1:15:58] WE all have flesh.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; WE ALL HAVE COMPLEXES. WE ARE A product
[1:16:04] of the environment we've been raised in.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY OUR CHURCHES SHOULD BE A SAFE
[1:16:10] PLACE.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE A PLACE WHERE SHEEP AND
[1:16:14] LAMBS COME TO.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S NOT FIGHTING IN THE CHURCH.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; OUR HOMES SHOULD BE A REFUGE
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; FROM THE STORMS OF LIFE.
[1:16:26] AND WE SING ABOUT IT. BUT WHEN WE SAID,
[1:16:28] "I SPEAK THE NAME OF JESUS OVER YOU,"
[1:16:31] THERE IS AUTHORITY AND POWER IN YOU AS A
[1:16:34] MAN AND AS A WOMAN, AS A SON AND
[1:16:37] DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CURSE, YOU CAN SWEAR, YOU CAN
[1:16:41] GET ALL UPSET. YOU CAN HIT YOUR FIST
[1:16:43] AGAINST THE WALL, OR YOU CAN SPEAK JESUS
[1:16:46] into the situation.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And Jesus IS NOT A FIVE-LETTER WORD.
[1:16:51] IT'S POWER AND THE LIFE BEHIND THE NAME.
[1:17:00] And the message is not 1,200 sermons and
[1:17:03] it's not volume so and so and year so
[1:17:05] and so. It's Christ.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; If you remember Moses IN NUMBERS 20 11,
[1:17:13] THE PROPHET MOSES WHEN HE STRUCK THE
[1:17:15] ROCK TWICE CUZ THE PEOPLE NEEDED WATER.
[1:17:18] AND FRIENDS, WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT
[1:17:20] RIGHT AWAY WHETHER THERE'S VICTORY,
[1:17:22] WHETHER there's tambourines, whether
[1:17:24] there's loud MUSIC OR GOOD PREACHING. WE
[1:17:27] WE STILL NEED WATERMEN.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; BY MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, you can
[1:17:32] BE LIVING OFF THE THE AURA OF MEETING SO
[1:17:34] LONG, BUT WE STILL HAVE TO COME BACK TO
[1:17:36] THE WELL.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; WE STILL HAVE TO HAVE A FOUNTAIN.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; AND FOR BELIEVERS, THE FOUNTAIN FOLLOWS
[1:17:43] US.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, THE ROCK FOLLOWED
[1:17:46] THEM. GMEN.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; AND THAT ROCK IS CHRIST.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; AND THE HOLY SPIRIT IS WITH YOU, even in
[1:17:55] you,
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; TO CAUTION YOU,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU'RE BEING OFFENSIVE,
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; TO TELL YOU HOW TO RAISE YOUR CHILDREN.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; OUR PASTORS IN THE MESSAGE WAS NOT
[1:18:09] CALLED TO RAISE YOUR FAMILIES.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, YOU ARE THEIR
[1:18:14] FATHER.
[1:18:16] YOU ARE THEIR MOTHER.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; GOD HEARS YOUR PRAYER.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT REALIZE TODAY IS IS
[1:18:24] FROM BEHIND THE PULPIT. THE THE HOLY
[1:18:26] SPIRIT IS EMPOWERING THE CONGREGATION.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; BUT FOR MANY YEARS, A LOT OF OUR UH THE
[1:18:32] WAY THAT IT WAS TAUGHT AND THE MESSAGE,
[1:18:34] IT WAS FUNNELED IN TO THE PASTOR AND TO
[1:18:36] THE TO THE PULPIT AND AND THEY HAD TO BE
[1:18:38] DYNAMIC AND THEY HAD TO BE CHARISMATIC
[1:18:40] AND IT ALL REVOLVED around that. AND IT
[1:18:43] WAS TOTALLY OPPOSITE.
[1:18:45] THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST IS TO PUT THE
[1:18:48] WORD INTO THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; CAN THE CHURCH SAY AMEN?
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; And we made superstar preachers and mega
[1:18:57] churches AND AND EVEN A CHURCH DOESN'T
[1:18:59] HAVE TO BE A MEGA CHURCH. IT CAN BE A
[1:19:01] SMALL CHURCH AND HAVE AN ARROGANT SPIRIT
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; AND BE proud
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; in the message.
[1:19:10] I've noticed that as we've traveled been
[1:19:12] able to travel around the world, I've
[1:19:15] noticed that you have in certain areas
[1:19:17] churches and and it's almost like
[1:19:19] they're they're the elite church.
[1:19:21] They're the church with the revelation
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; and it kind they carry an aura with them
[1:19:26] even when they're around people and they
[1:19:28] kind of look around the way they talk
[1:19:29] about other churches and other
[1:19:31] ministries and other youth groups. It's
[1:19:33] always negative. It's a AND THAT IS NOT
[1:19:36] THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:19:40] I SAID THAT IS NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Remember Moses struck the rock and water
[1:19:48] came. But it WAS THAT VERY THING LATER
[1:19:53] THAT CAUSED MOSES TO NOT TO GO INTO THE
[1:19:56] PROMISED LAND IS WHEN HE STRUCK THE ROCK
[1:19:58] TWICE INSTEAD OF SPEAKING TO THE ROCK.
[1:20:02] And it MIGHT HAVE WORKED YEARS AGO FOR
[1:20:05] YOU TO STRIKE THINGS AND HIT things and
[1:20:07] BE A TYPE OF PERSON THAT TAKES THE
[1:20:09] SWORD, BUT WE ARE LIVING IN ANOTHER
[1:20:11] SEASON.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; SAY, I'LL JUST PREACH THE SAME WAY AND
[1:20:15] GET THE SAME RESULTS. YOU MIGHT DO THAT,
[1:20:18] BUT GOD WILL DEAL WITH THAT PRIVATELY IN
[1:20:20] YOUR LIFE. AND BROTHER JOHN HAS
[1:20:23] PERSONALLY seen message CHURCHES THAT
[1:20:25] HAD CHOIRS AND AND GREAT CHURCHES AND
[1:20:28] AND GREAT MUSIC CRUMBLE AND ARE
[1:20:30] LITERALLY NOTHING TODAY.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; I COULD SAY NAMES AND I'M NOT GOING TO.
[1:20:38] IT'S NOT THE CHOIR. IT'S NOT THE SINGING
[1:20:41] THAT'S GOING TO GET US IN A BODY CHANGE.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO BE THE WORD IS EFFECTUAL
[1:20:46] AND IT'S CHANGING LIVES.
[1:20:48] AND THEY ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE JESUS.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Take this as A WARNING TODAY AND AS A A
[1:20:57] STRONG encouragement to us.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Remember when MOSES STRUCK IT TWICE,
[1:21:03] WATER came out. They still had camps.
[1:21:06] They still had youth meetings. They
[1:21:08] still had church.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; HOFFMAN'S HEAD WAS STILL, you know,
[1:21:12] hanging on the platform. YOU KNOW, THE
[1:21:14] CLOUD PHOTO WAS IN THERE. BUT SOMETHING
[1:21:16] HAD BEEN LOST.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING WAS NOT THE WAY THAT IT USED
[1:21:21] TO BE. AND THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:21:23] IS GOING AFTER TODAY. TO RESTORE UNTO
[1:21:26] YOU ALL THE YEARS.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE, SAYETH THE LORD.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; I just want to say some things very
[1:21:38] clearly. YOU CANNOT GO ABOUT THIS
[1:21:40] present season that we are in doing
[1:21:43] things the way you used TO BE AND EXPECT
[1:21:46] THE SAME RESULT. WE ARE IN ANOTHER
[1:21:49] SEASON.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD DIDN'T ALLOW DAVID TO BUILD
[1:21:53] THE TEMPLE CUZ HE WAS A MAN AFTER GOD'S
[1:21:55] OWN HEART. BUT BECAUSE HE WAS A MAN OF
[1:21:57] WAR AND BECAUSE HE HAD SO MUCH BLOOD ON
[1:22:00] HIS HANDS, GOD HAD TO RAISE UP HIS SON
[1:22:02] SOLOMON THAT WAS A MAN OF PEACE.
[1:22:07] And the only way I'm speaking out of
[1:22:10] family camp THAT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR
[1:22:12] FAMILIES AND OUR CHURCHES WILL BE A
[1:22:14] SUCCESS GOING FORWARD IS WHEN WE ARE A
[1:22:17] peaceloving people.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; God's people love peace.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; God's people I'm saying some things
[1:22:30] today.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; God's people are not warlike.
[1:22:39] God's people are peaceful.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; So what is brother John? What is civil
[1:22:46] war? Civil war is war between citizens
[1:22:50] of the same country.
[1:22:54] Is it getting a little warm in here? Are
[1:22:57] you a little warm? I think brother Cuban
[1:22:59] can help us with that.
[1:23:03] Civil War. And it's good for your
[1:23:06] children to hear this today.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; It's good for your young people to have
[1:23:10] a a minister come and actually preach on
[1:23:13] this.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; They might be sitting there very very
[1:23:16] quietly or looking down the row like
[1:23:18] this.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; But us parents need to be alert.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Us older ones, us elders in the message
[1:23:24] need TO TAKE NOTE ON WHAT THE SPIRIT IS
[1:23:27] SAYING TO THE CHURCH. AMEN.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; I I'm speaking to you TODAY FROM A HEART
[1:23:34] OF A MAN THAT'S BEEN BORN and raised in
[1:23:36] the message.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; And you watch ministry, even in New
[1:23:39] Zealand OR GLOBALLY, THEY SPEAK
[1:23:42] DIFFERENTLY WHEN THEY'VE BEEN RAISED IN
[1:23:44] the message.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE A TESTIMONY. GOD
[1:23:49] DELIVERED YOU FROM smoking and drinking
[1:23:51] and drugs and and a lot of those things.
[1:23:54] But when you have uh men of God or
[1:23:56] sisters THAT HAVE BEEN BIRTHED BY THE
[1:23:58] WORD AND THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH AND
[1:24:00] RAISED, THEY TALK TO PEOPLE DIFFERENT.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; THEY TREAT THE CONGREGATION DIFFERENT.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Now y'all got quiet really fast.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; It's the love of God to you
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; when he has gifts like you heard last
[1:24:19] night. IT'S THE LOVE OF GOD TO YOU THAT
[1:24:22] GOD WOULD ACTUALLY TALK SO CLEARLY to
[1:24:24] one of to us today on speak a message on
[1:24:27] no civil war. I could have spoke on a
[1:24:29] thousand other titles, but we have to
[1:24:31] speak what the Lord lays on our hearts.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; War between two countries. If you're
[1:24:35] writing notes, I just want to speak
[1:24:37] about civil war. Civil war can be within
[1:24:40] the individual
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; war things going on. Always battling,
[1:24:45] ALWAYS WARING. THAT'S YOUR MIND. That's
[1:24:49] your spirit.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOUR BODY.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; You have one one soul today. Are you
[1:24:55] listening?
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; SATAN HAS NO RIGHT TO COME INTO YOUR
[1:24:59] MIND AND DESTROY YOU.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. I I'm I'm I'm BATTLING WITH
[1:25:04] YOU. I'M JUMPING DOWN INTO THE TRENCH
[1:25:06] AND SAYING, "YOU HAVE ONE BODY. GIVE IT
[1:25:09] AS A TEMPLE TO THE LORD."
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT HERE TO rebuke you. DON'T TAKE
[1:25:12] THIS AS BROTHER JOHN REBUKING ANYBODY
[1:25:15] HERE. I'm I'm just a a middle-aged man
[1:25:17] myself, getting older.
[1:25:20] MY MY BODY IS A TEMPLE OF THE LORD. YOUR
[1:25:22] MIND IS NOT THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; All the SWIPING AND AND THIS AND SOCIAL
[1:25:28] MEDIA IS DESTROYING THE NEW GENERATION
[1:25:31] AND THEIR ABILITY TO EVEN CONNECT WITH
[1:25:34] THE WORD.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; AND ANYBODY THAT MINISTERS KNOWS THAT
[1:25:39] THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
[1:25:41] IT USED TO BE BEFORE WHEN I WAS IN NEW
[1:25:43] Zealand uh 30 years ago and we had a a
[1:25:48] meeting in a sheep sharing barn and a
[1:25:50] youth meeting. Some are here that were
[1:25:52] there. WHEN WE GAVE AN ALTAR CALL, EVERY
[1:25:55] PERSON IN THAT BUILDING WAS AT THE ALTAR
[1:25:58] EXCEPT FOR ONE OR TWO, THREE PEOPLE.
[1:26:01] TODAY YOU HAVE AN ALTAR CALL, YOU MIGHT
[1:26:03] GET ONE, TWO, THREE, FIVE. WE ARE IN
[1:26:06] ANOTHER SEASON.
[1:26:08] THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS LIFTING UP OFF THE
[1:26:10] EARTH.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU WANT TO ADMIT IT OR NOT,
[1:26:13] IT'S LIFTING UP OFF THE EARTH.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT READY TO GO BACK TO THE JEWS.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; HELLO, BRIDE OF NEW ZEALAND.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING AT THE END OF REVELATIONS
[1:26:22] 10. AND RIGHT BEFORE REVELATIONS 11,
[1:26:25] WHICH IS MOSES AND ELIJAH COMING BACK,
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; and they're going to LOVE THE MESSAGE
[1:26:31] JUST AS MUCH AS YOU LOVE IT TODAY,
[1:26:33] THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE THE WORD.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; It's Christ. AMEN.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE RIGHT AT THAT TIME OF THE
[1:26:40] SPIRIT LIFTING OFF THE EARTH FOR THE
[1:26:42] GENTILES.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A TIME IN THE BIBLE WHEN THE
[1:26:45] BIBLE SAYS, "I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT
[1:26:47] UPON ALL FLESH."
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; And people would just be slaying in the
[1:26:51] spirit. And they would WALK WITHIN JUST
[1:26:53] BLOCKS OF ISUZA STREET. Y'ALL HAVE HEARD
[1:26:55] OF THE ISUZA STREET REVIVAL IN LOS
[1:26:58] ANGELES. My wife and I's been right down
[1:27:00] there and walked down there WHERE THEY
[1:27:01] WERE. THEY SAID WITHIN BLOCKS OF THIS
[1:27:03] REVIVAL, PEOPLE WOULD JUST BE SMITTEN
[1:27:05] and repent of their sins.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; FRANK BARTLEMAN WAS A BLACK MAN AND
[1:27:12] other people THAT WERE LEADING
[1:27:13] SPEARHEADING THAT ISUZA STREET REVIVAL.
[1:27:16] THEY THEY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE AN
[1:27:18] ORGANIZED MUSIC PROGRAM AND AND EVEN
[1:27:20] THEY WOULD GET INTO A CORNER WITH A BOX
[1:27:22] OVER THEIR HEAD AND JUST BEGIN TO PRAY
[1:27:24] AND BEGIN TO PRAY FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND
[1:27:26] THE MIND OF CHRIST AND THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:27:29] WAS POURED OUT UPON THAT. IT WAS A
[1:27:31] PENTECOSTAL REVIVAL.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU AS BELIEVERS KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT
[1:27:35] GOING BACK. WE WE ARE GOING FORWARD.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS A SHOCK THAT WAS THAT WAS A
[1:27:41] SHOCK THAT WAS AROUND THE SEED. BUT
[1:27:44] THERE COMES A TIME WHEN THE SHOCK PULLS
[1:27:46] AWAY.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE LIVING IN THE TIME FOR YOU
[1:27:49] AND I TO COME TO FULL MANIFESTATION.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; LORD, help us to just be focused. civil
[1:27:58] war between an individual. Number two,
[1:28:01] civil war in marriages.
[1:28:04] Satan comes in quarrels and fighting in
[1:28:07] marriages.
[1:28:09] You can have and remember I'm SPEAKING
[1:28:11] NO CIVIL WAR. IT'S TIME TO STOP IT.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Waring number three IN FAMILIES,
[1:28:18] THINGS THAT GO ON IN FAMILIES. God
[1:28:21] brought you together. God allowed those
[1:28:23] things to happen. DON'T YOU BE THE
[1:28:26] PERSON THAT'S ALWAYS COMBATING AND
[1:28:29] ALWAYS DISPUTING. YOU'RE ALWAYS
[1:28:30] OPPOSITE.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Remember friends,
[1:28:36] you can be you can have the HOLY SPIRIT
[1:28:39] AND BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN THE PERSON
[1:28:41] NEXT TO YOU. THERE'S DIFFERENCES OF
[1:28:43] ADMINISTRATION.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT PAUL TAUGHT US.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; THERE'S DIFFERENCES of approach.
[1:28:50] Even in ministry, WE CAN HAVE OUR
[1:28:52] FAVORITES OR WE CAN FA THIS BROTHER KIND
[1:28:54] OF MINISTERS TO ME MORE. I RECEIVE MORE
[1:28:56] FROM THAT BROTHER OR THAT BROTHER'S DEEP
[1:28:59] OR THAT BROTHER'S SHALLOW. BUT REMEMBER,
[1:29:01] AS A PACKAGE,
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; IT'S CHRIST.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT YOU MIGHT COME AGAINST OR NOT
[1:29:07] EVEN LIKE, YOUR YOUNG PERSON MIGHT BE
[1:29:10] RECEIVING from that.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; SO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; ABOUT MINISTRY AND ABOUT CHURCHES. IT
[1:29:17] MIGHT BE THAT VERY SISTER OR BROTHER
[1:29:20] THAT HELPS WIN THEM TO CHRIST.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; YOU SPEAK NEGATIVE ALWAYS ABOUT THE SONG
[1:29:27] LEADER AND YOU GET HUFFY AND PUFFY CUZ
[1:29:30] THEY DON'T SING your the way that YOU
[1:29:32] LIKE. I JUST LIKE THE OLD FAVORITE
[1:29:34] SONGS. I JUST LIKE on the wings of a
[1:29:36] snow white dove. Do you know THAT WAS A
[1:29:38] SECULAR song that was being sung? I
[1:29:40] DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE NAMES OF THE
[1:29:42] WRITER AND WHO SANG that song. only
[1:29:45] believe WAS SANG BY UN PEOPLE THAT
[1:29:47] WEREN'T EVEN BELIEVERS.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST THE SONG, IT'S
[1:29:52] WHO'S SINGING IT.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to go here for ABOUT 30
[1:29:58] SECONDS. WE ARE BELIEVERS.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; And whatever music and the beat and THE
[1:30:03] WAY THAT IS SECULAR AND OUT IN
[1:30:05] CHRISTENDOM, THERE OUGHT TO BE A LITTLE
[1:30:07] CHECK MARK FOR US AS BELIEVERS.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; WE MIGHT BRING A SONG IN. WE MIGHT SAY,
[1:30:12] "WELL, THAT WAS GOOD OR THAT WAS THIS."
[1:30:15] BUT THAT BEAT IS from hell.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And rock and roll IS THE MUSIC THEY PLAY
[1:30:21] IN THE REGIONS OF THE LOST.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; SO, GIVE ME A QUOTE FOR THAT. SOULS IN
[1:30:26] PRISON. NOW,
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS A YOUNG BOY,
[1:30:29] 14 YEARS OLD, AND THEY SHOT HIM THROUGH
[1:30:32] THE LEGS AND BLOOD WAS GOING EVERYWHERE,
[1:30:34] AND HE SAID, "LO," AND HE CRIED OUT TO
[1:30:36] GOD. HERE IT WAS YEARS LATER,
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; 40 YEARS LATER, JUDGMENT. HE'S 54 and
[1:30:42] he's there there AND THE ESCALATORS
[1:30:45] GOING UP AND DOWN AND he heard the women
[1:30:47] coming up talking GOING ON ABOUT THE
[1:30:50] PRICES AND SO FORTH.
[1:30:53] BUT HE SAID IT'S THE SAME SOUND I HEARD
[1:30:56] WHEN I WENT DOWN INTO THE REGIONS OF THE
[1:30:58] LOST.
[1:31:02] Do you KNOW THAT'S THE BACKGROUND MUSIC
[1:31:04] FOR AC/DC? YOU PLAY IT BACKWARDS. THAT'S
[1:31:07] EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. AND ANYBODY THAT'S
[1:31:10] EVER STUDIED MUSIC KNOWS WHAT I'M
[1:31:11] TALKING ABOUT IS TRUE. IT'S THE
[1:31:13] BACKGROUND MUSIC. YOU TURN IT AROUND,
[1:31:15] ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC, IT'LL TAKE YOUR
[1:31:17] SOUL TO HELL.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; AND YOU BRING THAT INTO THE CHURCH, YOU
[1:31:21] WILL QUENCH THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT AGAINST DANCING IN THE SPIRIT,
[1:31:25] BUT I'VE SEEN A LOT OF DANCING AT
[1:31:27] MEETINGS AND CHURCHES IN THE MESSAGE,
[1:31:29] AND THAT OFFENDS THE HOLY SPIRIT. IT
[1:31:32] BECOMES SEXY. IT BECOMES WOMEN, A LOT OF
[1:31:34] WOMEN. IT BECOMES A LOT OF THIS. YOU CAN
[1:31:37] GET QUIET ALL YOU WANT TO. I'M HERE TO
[1:31:39] PLEASE THE LORD.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; AND EVERY HOLY GHOSTFILLED BELIEVER
[1:31:44] OUGHT TO AGREE WITH THIS. WE WANT TO
[1:31:47] PLEASE THE LORD.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "YOUR THOUGHTS
[1:31:52] ARE HEARD LOUDER IN HEAVEN THAN YOUR
[1:31:54] WORDS ARE ON EARTH."
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU LISTEN TO IN PRIVATE, WHAT
[1:31:59] YOU'RE FEEDING IN IN PRIVATE IS BEING
[1:32:01] PIPED THROUGH HEAVEN. BE CAREFUL WHAT
[1:32:03] YOU'RE LISTENING TO.
[1:32:06] I I DON'T I NEVER SAID IT ABOUT THE
[1:32:08] BROTHER, BUT I THINK IT YOU'RE YOU'RE
[1:32:10] GUILTY OF MURDER.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be embarrassing today if GOD
[1:32:16] HAD TO TELL THE ANGELS TO GO PLEASE turn
[1:32:18] down the volume of what's being coming
[1:32:20] through heaven because there's a lot of
[1:32:22] nonsense going on through my Holy Ghost
[1:32:24] fil believers that are down on earth.
[1:32:28] Number
[1:32:34] four is amongst friends you can have
[1:32:36] civil war.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; They're at variance. There's strife.
[1:32:39] They used to be close. They used to
[1:32:42] fellowship. They used to text. They used
[1:32:44] to call. I'm not I understand their
[1:32:46] seasons in our relationships, but don't
[1:32:49] become a fighter.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Number five is amongst churches.
[1:32:55] WE CAN GET A SPIRIT OF COMPETITION. AND
[1:32:58] I'M JUST GOT TO go here. WE LIVE IN A
[1:33:00] SOCIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT
[1:33:03] WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF RUGBY AND SOCCER
[1:33:06] and football and football and basketball
[1:33:09] and this and that and THE OTHER. AND IT
[1:33:11] BRINGS A SPIRIT OF COMPETITION
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; AMONGST OUR FAMILIES, AMONGST OUR
[1:33:16] TEENAGERS, AMONGST EVEN IN OUR
[1:33:18] RELATIONSHIPS. AND WE'VE GOT TO BE
[1:33:19] CAREFUL THAT DON'T COME INTO THE CHURCH.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT HERE TO COMPETE WITH ONE
[1:33:24] ANOTHER.
[1:33:25] BROTHER JONATHAN MARTIN IS A MAN OF GOD.
[1:33:27] I'M A MAN OF GOD. WE DID NOT COME FROM
[1:33:30] AMERICA TO SEE WHO CAN PREACH THE
[1:33:32] LOUDEST or the DEEPEST OR WE DID NOT
[1:33:34] COME FOR THAT.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT COMPETING.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; And when you sing a song or YOU GET IN
[1:33:43] FRONT OF THE THE THE CHURCH AND I'm
[1:33:45] looking for a microphone. Here's one.
[1:33:47] And and we NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL WE
[1:33:49] DON'T GET INTO THIS POSTURE, YOU KNOW,
[1:33:50] AND OUR HANDS HAVE GOT TO JUST BE RIGHT.
[1:33:52] AND WE JUST GOT TO LIFT UP OUR VOICE.
[1:33:54] AND FRIENDS, WE ARE HERE TO MINISTER TO
[1:33:56] ONE ANOTHER,
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; BUT MINISTER TO CHRIST.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; THERE IT IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN YOU SEE
[1:34:04] HOLLYWOOD COMING INTO THE MESSAGE.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; By the way, if you're praying about
[1:34:11] being a minister, you're out of your
[1:34:13] mind.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; If you want to be a minister,
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; you better make SURE IT'S THE HOLY Ghost
[1:34:19] leading you.
[1:34:21] Souls of MEN AND WOMEN DANGLE OVER HELL
[1:34:23] BY ONE WORD.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; BUT IF THEY DANGLE OVER HELL, WHAT ABOUT
[1:34:27] THEY DANGLE ABOUT RAPTURING FAITH AND
[1:34:30] GRACE AND MERCY? JUST SPEAK ABOUT LOVE
[1:34:32] AND YOU WATCH THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE
[1:34:34] CHANGE.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; I could start right now and SPEAK FOR
[1:34:37] THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES ABOUT
[1:34:38] RELATIONSHIPS, young people, young
[1:34:41] girls, young boys, PEOPLE THAT'S BEEN
[1:34:44] SLEEPING HALF out of it, NO ATTENTION,
[1:34:47] THEY BECOME IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED. WE ARE
[1:34:49] NOT HERE HERE TO BECOME CANDY CANE
[1:34:53] MINISTERS OR CHRISTIANS WHERE WE'RE JUST
[1:34:55] HERE TO BRING SOME EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT
[1:34:57] IN.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; WE'RE MORE DETERMINED THAT GOD BE WITH
[1:35:01] YOU ON TUESDAY AND ON WEDNESDAY
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; AND ON THURSDAY. HOW ARE YOU DOING? HOW
[1:35:06] DID THE WORD AFFECT YOU?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; DID IT CHANGE YOU?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; LORD, I WANT TO BE CHANGED.
[1:35:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Number six is civil wars between uh
[1:35:22] countries. You know, I'm from Australia.
[1:35:25] I'm from New Zealand. I'm from America.
[1:35:26] I'm I'm from SOUTH AFRICA. AND THEY
[1:35:29] WATCH WITH a they just walk with a pride
[1:35:31] that you know there's all this pride and
[1:35:33] arrogancy and it can cause war. Number
[1:35:36] seven is amongst believers IN CHRIST AND
[1:35:39] AMONGST THE BODY OF CHRIST THERE CAN BE
[1:35:42] CIVIL WARS.
[1:35:44] There can be tension and STRESS
[1:35:47] THAT COMES IN RELATIONSHIPS AND FIGHTING
[1:35:50] THAT GOES ON. NUMBER EIGHT, LASTLY, is
[1:35:53] the civil war
[1:35:56] amongst message believers. You didn't
[1:35:59] want me to go there, did you? For years,
[1:36:02] you know, you'd go to meetings AND
[1:36:03] THEY'D PREACH ABOUT THE BAPTIST, THEY'D
[1:36:05] PREACH ABOUT THE PENTECOSTAL. AMEN,
[1:36:08] BROTHER.
[1:36:11] YOU PREACH ABOUT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
[1:36:13] PREACH ABOUT THE POPE. YEAH. [screaming]
[1:36:15] WE pastored for some years down in
[1:36:17] Tennessee when I was 23 years old.
[1:36:21] Just young boot camp, you know, just
[1:36:24] young. Just really young. That was good
[1:36:27] for us. Amen.
[1:36:30] Now I'm getting older and I forget what
[1:36:32] I was going to talk about about
[1:36:36] Oh yeah, here it was. And our precious
[1:36:38] brother, he was the loudest AMENER IN
[1:36:40] THE CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:36:42] [screaming]
[1:36:43] AND ABOUT REVELATION, YOU TALK ABOUT
[1:36:46] THUNDERS and rainbows and all that. HE
[1:36:48] WAS RIGHT THERE. BUT YOU TALK ABOUT
[1:36:50] FAMILY. YOU TALK ABOUT THINGS RIGHT DOWN
[1:36:52] TO HOME. It just gets quiet.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Don't go there.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; You know, I was with you, BROTHER, WHEN
[1:36:58] YOU WERE QUOTING OUR PROPHET. BUT NOW
[1:37:00] YOU'VE KIND OF GONE OUT ON A LIMB A
[1:37:02] LITTLE BIT. WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY to do
[1:37:04] that.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Say, who gave you the authority? The
[1:37:07] Holy Spirit.
[1:37:11] And you know, maybe it's just our makeup
[1:37:13] and and we're a brother John, but I
[1:37:17] always consider the innocent and ones
[1:37:20] caught in the crossfires of war.
[1:37:23] I always consider the collateral damage
[1:37:26] and those that are hurt and offended,
[1:37:28] the weaker one among us and people that
[1:37:31] ARE NEW CHRISTIANS. WAR IS A HORRIBLE
[1:37:34] THING.
[1:37:36] I THINK AFTER THIS SERVICE, the Lord is
[1:37:39] really working in hearts right now.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; War is a horrible thing.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Anybody that even has A HEART, HEARS
[1:37:49] WHAT'S happening on the news in
[1:37:51] Palestine or Israel or Ukraine or
[1:37:54] Russia.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; WAR IS A HORRIBLE THING. HAVE Y'ALL SAW
[1:37:59] PICTURES AND IMAGES OF ALL THE
[1:38:00] BUILDINGS, all the families, all this,
[1:38:03] all the killing, ALL THE WARING, ALL THE
[1:38:06] BLOOD,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; ALL THE STRIFE AND ALL THE MURDER, all
[1:38:14] the politics.
[1:38:19] You know, I can speak about our country,
[1:38:21] America, that brother Brandham talked
[1:38:23] about.
[1:38:25] We have it in America. We have the
[1:38:27] politics and you have the Democrats, you
[1:38:29] have the Republicans and like they'll
[1:38:32] have a vote on something AND THEY'LL BE
[1:38:33] JUST AS OPPOSITE. IT'LL, you know, you
[1:38:36] have a hundred members and and it'll
[1:38:37] comes down to 4951.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; You have 400 and somebody 400 and
[1:38:44] something representatives, you know,
[1:38:46] have all THE ONE PARTY VOTE THIS WAY AND
[1:38:48] ALL THE OTHER PARTY VOTE THIS WAY AND
[1:38:50] WE'RE TRYING TO GET VOTES TO GET
[1:38:52] SOMETHING THROUGH. IT'S POLITICS.
[1:38:55] DON'T BRING THAT INTO THE CHURCH.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; DON'T BRING THAT SPIRIT INTO THE
[1:39:00] MESSAGE.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to sit down ON YOU BECAUSE I
[1:39:06] DON'T LIKE YOUR SON. I DON'T LIKE YOUR
[1:39:08] DAUGHTER.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Where if you knew what WAS GOING ON
[1:39:11] PRIVATELY AND YOU KNEW WHAT WAS GOING
[1:39:13] ON, THE HOLY SPIRIT KNOWS EVERYTHING.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES THE LORD WILL REVEAL JUST SOME
[1:39:18] LITTLE SOMETHING about a loved one or
[1:39:20] family member and YOU'LL JUST GO ON at
[1:39:22] some TANGENT SOMEWHERE. YOU'LL BLOW UP
[1:39:24] THE CHAT. YOU'LL BLOW UP THE TEXT. AND
[1:39:26] THAT'S WHY GOD CAN'T REVEAL DEEPER
[1:39:28] THINGS to us.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Do we REALIZE ALL THE BREAKUPS IN HOMES?
[1:39:38] WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IN THE
[1:39:40] MESSAGE ONENESS, HE SAID, "ANYTHING THAT
[1:39:42] COMES BETWEEN YOU IS NOT OF GOD."
[1:39:46] when churches AND I'M GOING TO COME DOWN
[1:39:48] A LITTLE TIGHTER WHEN CHURCH MINISTRIES
[1:39:51] ALWAYS FOCUSED on fighting and war and
[1:39:54] swords
[1:39:56] even in the MESSAGE
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; AND IT STARTS in Sunday school you walk
[1:40:01] in and there's Ephesians there's the
[1:40:03] soldier there's the man and he's got his
[1:40:05] helmet and and I'm not saying THAT'S BAD
[1:40:07] TAKE UNTO YOU THE WHOLE ARMOR OF God
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; and then they come into the service and
[1:40:12] they hear about war and they CARE ABOUT
[1:40:14] FIGHTING EVERYBODY TRAINING FOR WAR. IF
[1:40:17] WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, IT WILL RAISE A WHOLE
[1:40:20] GENERATION IN OUR CHURCH. THAT'S EXACTLY
[1:40:23] WHAT THEY ARE. THEY'RE FIGHTERS. THEY'RE
[1:40:25] WARRIORS AND THEY'RE KILLERS. AND IF YOU
[1:40:28] DON'T COME TO OUR CHURCH AND IF YOU
[1:40:29] DON'T STREAM OUR website and if you
[1:40:32] don't say good things about them, they
[1:40:33] become WARRIORS AND FIGHTERS. AND THAT
[1:40:35] IS NOT THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:40:41] the the armor is AGAINST THE ENEMY. IT'S
[1:40:44] TO BE DEF IT'S THE THE SHIELD OF FAITH
[1:40:47] IS TO STOP THE FIERY DARTS, THE SWORD
[1:40:50] AND ALL THE WEAPONS OF DEFENSE OR
[1:40:53] OFFENSE.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD AND
[1:40:57] WARRIORS FOR THE LIVING GOD. BUT YOU
[1:40:59] START PREACHING THAT EVERY SERVICE and
[1:41:01] every day and every one of your opening
[1:41:03] comments and all of your filler is
[1:41:05] fighting and waring AND LET'S GO TAKE
[1:41:07] THE HEAD OFF THE DEVIL. YEAH.
[1:41:08] [screaming] WOW.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, IT'LL BREED A
[1:41:12] WHOLE GENERATION OF FIGHTERS.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE NOT PART OF OUR YOUTH
[1:41:16] GROUP AND IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH US AND
[1:41:18] THEN IT BECOMES JUST OVER THE TABLE, you
[1:41:20] know, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TALKING AT
[1:41:21] THE LUNCH.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; I'm just putting it out there as a
[1:41:26] warning.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; GOD, HELP THE OLDER GENERATION.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; You live BY THE SWORD, YOU'LL DIE BY THE
[1:41:34] SWORD.
[1:41:38] I had that in my notes. It was in my
[1:41:39] next statement and I didn't even know.
[1:41:42] But just remember that, friends.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; I know that we're here in New Zealand
[1:41:48] and we're not back in America, but let
[1:41:51] me just give you a little bit of history
[1:41:53] about the American Civil War. Can I do
[1:41:55] that?
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; The American Civil War. And if you look
[1:41:58] at these pictures that I'm showing you
[1:42:02] of all the shooting, all the killing,
[1:42:04] even ironclad, they called the boats and
[1:42:07] things ironclad. It becomes a certain
[1:42:09] mentality. It went on for four years,
[1:42:13] one month and two weeks. CIVIL WAR,
[1:42:17] PEOPLE OF THE SAME COUNTRY. AREN'T WE
[1:42:20] SUPPOSED TO BE BROTHERS?
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Aren't we supposed to be in the same
[1:42:25] country?
[1:42:27] four years and one month and two weeks.
[1:42:31] It goes on to say that this American
[1:42:33] Civil War, this is in 1861
[1:42:37] to 1865, it was a civil war in the
[1:42:40] United States between the Union, the
[1:42:42] North and the Confederacy, which was the
[1:42:44] South.
[1:42:45] And certain states in the South
[1:42:47] succeeded from the Union. And this whole
[1:42:50] conflict and things was in dispute. It
[1:42:52] wasn't all about slavery, but they used
[1:42:54] that as an emotional thing to actually
[1:42:57] put it out there and it began to expand
[1:42:59] to other territories.
[1:43:02] The American Civil War, you say, "Why do
[1:43:05] you talk about this? Why do you even
[1:43:07] bring up a natural thing?" Because it
[1:43:09] when you see it coming in AND BREEDING
[1:43:11] INTO THE SPIRITUAL, WE NEED TO TAKE NOTE
[1:43:14] of this. One of the things about this
[1:43:16] the the Civil War that a lot of people
[1:43:18] don't maybe realize, Brother Brandham
[1:43:21] spoke a lot about Abraham Lincoln, but
[1:43:24] it was actually in this in the season
[1:43:27] when he won presidential election. HE
[1:43:30] WAS A GOOD MAN, BUT IT WAS WHEN THE
[1:43:32] SPIRIT OF THE nation and the Confederacy
[1:43:35] came and and and wanted TO BREAK OFF
[1:43:37] FROM THEM.
[1:43:39] SEE, SOMETIMES YOU CAN SAY, "BUT IT'S
[1:43:41] FOR A GOOD REASON, OR IT'S IT'S FOR A
[1:43:44] GOOD CAUSE, OR THIS BROTHER DON'T
[1:43:46] BELIEVE IT A CERTAIN WAY, or he doesn't
[1:43:48] BELIEVE IN THE THIRD POOL, OR HE DOESN'T
[1:43:50] BELIEVE THE SEVEN seals have been
[1:43:52] revealed, or but friends, DIDN'T GOD
[1:43:55] GIVE YOU A SPACE?"
[1:43:58] THERE MIGHT BE A TIME THAT WE'RE A
[1:44:00] CERTAIN WAY AND WE'RE VERY STRONG ABOUT
[1:44:03] IT AND VERY PASSIONATE AND THEN A FEW
[1:44:05] YEARS GO BY AND GOD REVEALS THAT THERE'S
[1:44:08] ANOTHER SIDE TO IT.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE. NO
[1:44:11] MATTER HOW THIN YOU SLICE SOMETHING,
[1:44:14] THERE'S ALWAYS two sides.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; And everybody wants grace. Everybody
[1:44:19] wants forgiveness for yourself. BUT WHEN
[1:44:22] IT'S FOR SOMEONE ELSE, IT'S LIKE, OH
[1:44:24] MAN,
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; but you don't know, brother John. I
[1:44:28] don't need to know.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT KNOWS.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; By the way, Brother Ben glowing and I
[1:44:34] probably had about few minutes together.
[1:44:38] He hasn't told me about what's
[1:44:39] happening. I've had very little time
[1:44:41] with brother Andy, brother Freddy,
[1:44:43] brother an Andrew Donaldelsson, my
[1:44:45] precious friend, brother Als
[1:44:50] and Tennessee. I haven't spoken to your
[1:44:53] pastors about your needs here. I believe
[1:44:56] it's the Holy Spirit. I
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; I just feel and I know that you have
[1:45:00] done very well New Zealand. I've seen it
[1:45:02] in your love and in your brotherly
[1:45:04] kindness for one another. So, I'm not
[1:45:06] speaking about anything that someone
[1:45:08] spoke to me last night for two hours in
[1:45:10] my room. It didn't happen.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Didn't hardly speak to my wife for two
[1:45:17] hours last night. In fact, our, you
[1:45:20] know, our young people that was next
[1:45:21] door to us, they came in later, like
[1:45:24] after midnight. They were so loud the
[1:45:25] night before. Brother Freddy, Brother
[1:45:28] Freddy, and those old young people, they
[1:45:30] were so loud the night before. We're
[1:45:32] trying to go to sleep and THEY'RE DA DA
[1:45:35] DA.
[1:45:37] So somehow my wife mentioned it jokingly
[1:45:40] to them and last night it was quiet.
[1:45:44] I think the party was at, you know, the
[1:45:47] Jeffrey's house or something
[1:45:51] and I I went to sleep good last night.
[1:46:00] Be very very careful.
[1:46:03] Be very sensitive about your movements,
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; especially at this time.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Ask the Lord if it's his perfect will
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; for you to do whatever's in your mind to
[1:46:14] do.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz you might feel justified. You might
[1:46:18] feel totally vindicated,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; but you've got to BE MINDFUL OF THE
[1:46:22] SHEEP.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO BE MINDFUL OF the lambs.
[1:46:26] AND IT WOULD BE BETTER for you to be
[1:46:30] having a millstone hung around YOUR NECK
[1:46:32] AND CAST OUT IN THE OCEAN OFF THE New
[1:46:34] Zealand coast than to offend one of
[1:46:37] God's lambs. And the church said,
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; "IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU TO BE CAST
[1:46:44] INTO THE SEA AND GO DOWN TO THE BOTTOM
[1:46:46] AND DROWN THAN FOR YOU TO GET ON YOUR
[1:46:48] LITTLE WEBSITE OR YOUR LITTLE CHAT BOX
[1:46:50] AND YOUR LITTLE social media
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; or GO AFTER CHURCH AND BUM BUM. YOU CAN
[1:46:57] DESTROY THE EFFECTS OF THIS THIS CHURCH
[1:46:59] SERVICE FROM HERE TO THE DINING HALL."
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:47:06] SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY QUICK TO GET OUT OF
[1:47:08] THAT DOOR. THEY NEED TO COME THE OTHER
[1:47:10] WAY.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; AND IT WOULD BE VERY GOOD IF IT STARTED
[1:47:13] WITH THE ELDERS.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in message blushing
[1:47:17] prophet and and those messages. He said,
[1:47:20] "And I'll be the first one who would
[1:47:22] join me at the at the altar today at the
[1:47:24] altar." And he came RIGHT AROUND IN THE
[1:47:26] BRHAM TABERNACLE AND HE PRAYED AT THE
[1:47:29] ALTAR. MY YOU GOD, GIVE US MORE
[1:47:31] LEADERSHIP like that.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. WILL NEVER BE THE PROPHET,
[1:47:35] BUT HE WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Did I offend anybody yet?
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; So, in the civil war, there was like a
[1:47:45] wave of enthusiasm that swept through
[1:47:48] this time. You know, everybody was
[1:47:50] feeling vindicated because of their
[1:47:52] position. But I want you to look. I'm
[1:47:54] not asking you to take any notes of this
[1:47:56] graph or I'm not going to give you a
[1:47:58] test. But you can look on one side the
[1:48:02] United States and the other side the
[1:48:04] Confederate States. You can look on down
[1:48:06] through there. I want you to see the
[1:48:08] casualties and the losses of civil war.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; I'm just focusing a little bit those
[1:48:16] that were killed in action. KIA or DO
[1:48:20] died of wounds. Can y'all see that on
[1:48:22] the screen?
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; 110,000 for the one side, 94,000 on the
[1:48:28] other.
[1:48:30] 230,000
[1:48:31] died from accidents or disease in the
[1:48:34] United States Army. In the Confederate,
[1:48:36] it was 164,000
[1:48:39] died from accidents or disease. 25 to
[1:48:43] 30,000 people died in the prisons on one
[1:48:47] side. On the other side, it was 26,000
[1:48:49] to 31,000 died in prisons.
[1:48:53] You see the wounded
[1:48:58] wounded,
[1:49:01] broken hearts,
[1:49:04] broken homes,
[1:49:08] discouraged.
[1:49:12] God forgive me, but when our church
[1:49:14] services
[1:49:16] become to where our young people check
[1:49:19] out halfway through
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; AND THEY'RE BORED, THEY GOT THEIR ARMS
[1:49:24] CROSSED.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; AND OUR PASTORS AND OUR MINISTERS AREN'T
[1:49:27] SENSITIVE to that.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; We're too interested in the 99 and the
[1:49:32] TITHE PAYERS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE GIVING
[1:49:34] GOOD MONEY OFFERINGS. AND WE'RE not
[1:49:36] willing to allow our messages to get off
[1:49:38] the MOUNTAINTOPS AND COME DOWN INTO THE
[1:49:41] VALLEYS.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; There's a scripture for that. In the
[1:49:44] valley, he restores our soul.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Especially for some of our brothers.
[1:49:52] I'll give you two scriptures. In Samuel,
[1:49:55] David said, "Thy gentleness hath made me
[1:49:58] great."
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; In Psalms, HE REPEATS THE SAME VERSE.
[1:50:02] THY GENTLENESS HATH made me great. This
[1:50:06] is a man of war. THIS IS A MAN OF
[1:50:08] FIGHTING.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Thy gentleness hath made me great. I've
[1:50:16] learned to be gentle. Can you all see
[1:50:19] that on the screen? How many casualties?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; And even free civilians died. There were
[1:50:24] mothers that died in the crossfire.
[1:50:26] There was grandmas.
[1:50:28] I'm just sitting out on my porch. I'm 73
[1:50:31] years old and all of a sudden a bullet,
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; an arrow,
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; a cannonball.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; We're just all sleeping in our HOUSE AND
[1:50:45] ALL OF a sudden a cannonball rips
[1:50:46] through the living room and takes some
[1:50:48] of our young people.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; No civil war. By the end of the war,
[1:50:56] much of the South's infrastructure
[1:50:59] had been destroyed. Can you imagine all
[1:51:02] the the fences, the roads, the buildings
[1:51:06] in the South? Much had been destroyed.
[1:51:09] When it collapsed and slavery was
[1:51:11] abolished, 4 million enslaved black
[1:51:14] people were freed. AND YOU'D SAY,
[1:51:15] "PRAISE GOD." BUT WHAT ABOUT THE COST?
[1:51:23] YOU SAY, "I DON'T THINK ABOUT THE
[1:51:25] COLLATERAL DAMAGE." BROTHER JOHN, you're
[1:51:27] insane.
[1:51:30] You don't think about how it's being
[1:51:32] taken.
[1:51:38] You've lost your mind if you don't think
[1:51:40] about what people think about you and
[1:51:43] how you're coming across.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; You offend. You hurt others and yeah all
[1:51:50] THE TIME YOU JUSTIFY YOURSELF.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; You know what YOU'RE DOING? YOU'RE PART
[1:51:54] OF A CIVIL WAR.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; And let ME JUST SAY THIS VERY NICELY.
[1:51:59] MOST OF THE TIME THE people we offend
[1:52:01] the most are people right around us,
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; OUR SPOUSES, OUR CHILDREN,
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; people in our church.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; And I say, "GOD, FORGIVE US." AMEN.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; I lift our HANDS AND I SAY, "GOD,
[1:52:14] FORGIVE US IF IF I'VE COME ACROSS HOTTIE
[1:52:16] AND proud
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; and arrogant."
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; When you walk out of an airplane and you
[1:52:26] I think I mentioned this on Youth
[1:52:27] Without Borders, but you go out of an
[1:52:29] airplane and you walk up this jetway up
[1:52:31] to the airport. I think they call it a
[1:52:34] jetway.
[1:52:35] On the sides there, they sometimes have
[1:52:37] advertisements or stickers and things.
[1:52:39] When you fly into Seattle or Vancouver,
[1:52:43] I'm just forgetting which one. Along the
[1:52:45] side, they say this airport is a safe
[1:52:47] place. Have y'all heard of that before?
[1:52:50] Tell somebody.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; If you're being trafficked, if
[1:52:55] something's going on sexually, abused
[1:52:57] and drugs, you're flying in here because
[1:52:59] you've been taken from another country
[1:53:02] against your will, someone's forcing
[1:53:04] you, tell somebody.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; This is a safe place.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S AN AIRPORT.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE OF THE WORLD HAVE RECOGNIZED
[1:53:14] THERE HAS TO BE A safe place.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE A PLACE THAT IF
[1:53:18] SOMETHING'S GOING ON PRIVATELY THAT YOU
[1:53:20] CAN TELL SOMEONE AND THEY WILL BE AN
[1:53:23] ADVOCATE FOR YOU. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
[1:53:25] TODAY, OUR HOMES, OUR CHURCHES, OUR CAMP
[1:53:28] SERVICES LIKE THIS SHOULD BE SAFE
[1:53:31] PLACES.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE PRIVATE
[1:53:34] CONVERSATIONS AND AND RELATIONSHIPS. I'M
[1:53:36] NOT SPEAKING IMMORALLY. I'M TALKING
[1:53:38] ABOUT WHERE WE CAN OPEN UP OUR HEART AND
[1:53:40] TELL SOMEBODY WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH
[1:53:42] AND IN THE NEXT 5 MINUTES WHEN WE WALK
[1:53:44] AWAY, IT'S NOT OUT ON THE CHURCH CHAT.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; PLEASE PRAY FOR THIS YOUNG PERSON. SHAME
[1:53:49] ON YOU.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; I'VE HAD IT IN AROUND THE WORLD WITH
[1:53:53] PRAYER LINES AT YOUTH meetings and youth
[1:53:55] AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THE NEXT
[1:53:57] WEDNESDAY AND THE NEXT SUNDAY, WHAT WAS
[1:53:59] SAID PRIVATELY IS COMING ACROSS THE
[1:54:01] PUBLIC.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; IT'S COMING ACROSS PUBLICLY. AND I I SAY
[1:54:05] SHAME ON THOSE MINISTERS. Our
[1:54:10] prophet wasn't like that.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; IN FACT, IF THERE'D COME A LADY UP IN
[1:54:14] THE LINE, HE WOULD STOP THE MICROPHONE.
[1:54:16] HE WOULD SAY, "CAN I say it? SHE'S GOING
[1:54:19] THROUGH MENOPAUSE. SHE'S GOING THROUGH A
[1:54:21] BLOOD ISSUE. CAN I SAY IT? Can I say it
[1:54:24] publicly?"
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; HE'S VERY RESPECTFUL. OUR PROPHET WAS A
[1:54:28] GENTLEMAN.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; WHY DID IT RAISE UP A GENERATION IN THE
[1:54:31] MESSAGE THAT are so arrogant AND AND
[1:54:34] IT'S MY WAY OR THE HIGHWAY? WHERE DID
[1:54:35] THAT COME FROM?
[1:54:38] WHY IS THERE ELEMENTS OF THE MESSAGE
[1:54:39] THAT YOU SEE one after the other after
[1:54:42] the other THAT CHURCH GROUP THEY
[1:54:44] STRUGGLE IN THEIR MARRIAGES? WHY?
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; CUZ IT'S COMING ACROSS THE PULPIT.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; THAT OUR WOMEN ARE SOMEHOW WAY down here
[1:54:53] somewhere. She's a byproduct. And they
[1:54:55] say it with, you know, she buys product
[1:54:58] and they SAY IT, BUT THEN IT BECOMES A
[1:54:59] RHETORIC. THEN IT BECOMES THEY'RE
[1:55:01] TALKING NEGATIVE ABOUT THE SISTERS.
[1:55:04] Do you know that the SISTERS ARE THE
[1:55:07] GLORY OF THE CHURCH?
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; OUR YOUNG PEOPLE REFLECT YOUR
[1:55:12] REVELATION.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; We don't even NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU
[1:55:16] BELIEVE, BUT WE SEE YOUR young people
[1:55:18] and we see how your sisters are.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just giving you a little secret.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; And if all the sisters ARE ARROGANT AND
[1:55:24] THEY'RE STRONG AND THEY'RE feminist and
[1:55:26] THEY'RE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALWAYS
[1:55:28] TALKING UP, SOME SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.
[1:55:30] BUT IF THE BROTHERS ARE OVERBEARING AND
[1:55:33] ALWAYS OUT TO CONQUER THE WORLD AND I'M
[1:55:35] THE man around here, I'M THE PAPA BEAR.
[1:55:38] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; I'm just going TO SAY IT PUBLICLY.
[1:55:42] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; AND PASTORS THAT BUT THE PULPIT THAT
[1:55:48] MIGHT HAVE WORKED YEARS AGO,
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; MOSES,
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT HAVE STRUCK THE ROCK AND SHOOT
[1:55:54] IT OUT OF THE ROCK, BUT WE are in
[1:55:56] another season.
[1:56:01] I'm glad I got money in the bank with
[1:56:03] some of you. Amen.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; I can say these things. Some of you,
[1:56:06] where's he coming from? You don't know
[1:56:08] me.
[1:56:10] To you that know us, no. I would never
[1:56:12] say anything to you that would offend
[1:56:14] you.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Even if I knew about it,
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; you probably wouldn't know that I knew.
[1:56:22] But the Holy Spirit knows.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; And he's just like a gentleman. He's
[1:56:26] just like a dove. and he'll just come
[1:56:28] down and flutter down and we we say
[1:56:30] something arrogant. We say something
[1:56:31] against ANOTHER BROTHER, HE FLIES AWAY.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF US are living like that?
[1:56:36] HE'S ALREADY FLOWN AWAY A MONTHS AGO.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; You can sing only believe and amazing
[1:56:42] grace before every speaker. AND IF
[1:56:44] YOU'VE OFFENDED THE HOLY SPIRIT, the
[1:56:47] Lord won't move in that atmosphere.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; THEN IT BECOMES A CHURCH CULTURE.
[1:56:57] And people already know what I'm talking
[1:56:58] about.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; AND I JUST SAY, "GOD, OFFENSES WILL
[1:57:03] COME,
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LET ME BE THE one
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; that doesn't exclude you from sometimes
[1:57:13] being strong and saying something."
[1:57:16] And the SWORD COMES AND IT GOES and it
[1:57:18] cuts both coming and going. BUT THEN IF
[1:57:21] YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT, YOU BETTER
[1:57:23] BRING SOME OIL.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; YOU BETTER BRING SOME BOMB RIGHT BEHIND
[1:57:26] THAT.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN TRAINED VERY WELL BY OUR
[1:57:30] PROPHET. HE SAID, "SAY SOMETHING THAT'LL
[1:57:31] MAKE THEM MAD and then say something
[1:57:33] that'll make him glad.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Say something really strong and then
[1:57:38] he'll just give a little example and
[1:57:40] talk about lambs or sheep or what what I
[1:57:42] was going through this morning." And
[1:57:44] then you just SAY SOMETHING STRONG. OUR
[1:57:45] PROPHET DID THAT.
[1:57:50] But if the whole service is that way,
[1:57:52] then the next service, the next month,
[1:57:54] and you're just strong, BROTHER. YOU'RE
[1:57:56] STRONG, BROTHER. HALLELUJAH. This
[1:57:58] world's going down. THIS WORLD'S FALLING
[1:58:00] APART. That's all true. But we're not
[1:58:02] going down,
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; and we're not FALLING APART. WE'RE GOING
[1:58:06] UP.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; But you CAN KEEP PEOPLE UNDERWATER AND
[1:58:09] JUST KEEP PUSHING THEM DOWN. KEEP
[1:58:11] PUSHING THEM DOWN. ALL WITH THE QUOTES
[1:58:13] OF BROTHER BRANDHAM. You could have 68
[1:58:15] quotes.
[1:58:24] I better preach like it was my last
[1:58:26] service or last time to you see these
[1:58:29] states and things. I would just say,
[1:58:31] Lord, if if there's been civil war in
[1:58:34] our country of New Zealand, would you
[1:58:36] help us, Lord, navigate out of that,
[1:58:38] Lord?
[1:58:42] If we become always training our people
[1:58:45] for war, we talk about war. We dream of
[1:58:49] war. I'm talking naturally and
[1:58:52] spiritually. We sing of war. Our songs
[1:58:55] that are written because a minister
[1:58:56] preached a certain message. So, it's of
[1:58:58] war. So, for the next three or five
[1:59:00] years, we're singing that song. We've
[1:59:02] got our young people singing it. We got
[1:59:04] the people singing it. They're all into
[1:59:06] it. IF YOU IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY TRAINING
[1:59:09] for war, we will never accept peace.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; It could be sitting right IN FRONT OF
[1:59:15] YOU. IT COULD BE STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT
[1:59:17] OF YOU AND YOU'D REJECT IT. SAY, "GIVE
[1:59:20] me an example. Jesus Christ."
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; The scribes, the Pharisees, the rulers,
[1:59:26] THEY KNEW THE TORAH, THEY KNEW THE BIBLE
[1:59:28] SO MUCH to where it was rolled up in a
[1:59:30] scroll. You just put a PIN UP THROUGH
[1:59:32] IT. THEY KNEW EVERY CHAPTER, every
[1:59:34] verse, every line. Yet when Jesus came
[1:59:37] to fulfill that, they crucified him.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; IT IS HAPPENING TODAY ALL OVER THE WORLD
[1:59:43] IN the message. YOU SAY, "WE BELIEVE THE
[1:59:45] MESSAGE. WE believe this." BUT IF WE'RE
[1:59:47] NOT CAREFUL, HE COULD APPEAR RIGHT AMONG
[1:59:49] US IN THESE MEETINGS.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; WITH HIS PRESENCE, PUTTING HIS FINGER
[1:59:54] DELICATELY DOWN IN AN AREA THAT NOBODY
[1:59:56] WANTS TO TALK ABOUT.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; I I I just want to take about a
[2:00:01] two-minute detour. I I want to speak on
[2:00:04] behalf OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE, THEN I WANT
[2:00:06] TO SPEAK ON BEHALF of the parents. Cuz
[2:00:08] sometimes OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL LIKE,
[2:00:10] WELL, THEY'RE JUST GETTING AT ME.
[2:00:12] THEY'RE JUST ALWAYS AGAINST ME. THEY'RE
[2:00:14] JUST ALWAYS I CAN'T DO THIS AND I CAN'T
[2:00:16] GO THERE. IT'S SUCH A BONDAGE. IT'S SUCH
[2:00:19] A HINDRANCE.
[2:00:23] I was thinking of this on our walk
[2:00:24] yesterday before the service. BUT LITTLE
[2:00:27] DO WE REALIZE THAT THOSE WALLS THAT GOD
[2:00:30] HAS ALLOWED AROUND US IN OUR CHURCHES,
[2:00:32] IN OUR FAMILIES, AND FOR YOU AS AN
[2:00:34] INDIVIDUAL IS ACTUALLY GOD'S PROTECTION.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; HE'S KEEPING YOU FROM EVIL.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; HE'S KEEPING YOU FROM HARDSHIP DOWN THE
[2:00:43] ROAD. HE SEES DOWN THE ROAD AND HE'S
[2:00:46] TRYING TO SAVE YOU.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Then I want to speak for our parents.
[2:00:56] Sometimes we do all we can. We we work.
[2:00:59] We labor financially. We try to make a
[2:01:02] home.
[2:01:07] We'll move to another church. We'll try
[2:01:10] TO GET THEM IN A GOOD ATMOSPHERE. We'll
[2:01:12] take them to family camps. We'll try to
[2:01:14] CAN WE HAVE A YOUTH CAMP?
[2:01:18] We try to do everything that and then
[2:01:21] they come up in A IN A CERTAIN WAY AND
[2:01:23] THEN things start affecting and they
[2:01:25] start being influenced. I'm being
[2:01:27] sensitive right now.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; AND THEY START BEING INFLUENCED BY
[2:01:30] SCHOOL AND BY FRIENDS. I'M thinking of a
[2:01:33] young lady in Europe that was WHEN SHE
[2:01:35] WAS 12 YEARS OLD BECAUSE their culture
[2:01:37] is a little different than New Zealand.
[2:01:38] They're they're more in the cities and
[2:01:40] things. So they gave her a cell phone at
[2:01:42] a very young age cuz she has to go on a
[2:01:44] train to school. she has to go on a
[2:01:46] bicycle and go down to the train station
[2:01:49] and go. So, at a young age, she was
[2:01:51] already influenced by by the internet
[2:01:54] and and then boyfriends and then media
[2:01:57] and then certain music AND SHE'S JUST A
[2:02:00] YOUNG AGE.
[2:02:03] Little did she know down the road it
[2:02:05] would take her young heart into the
[2:02:08] world and into a relationship and
[2:02:13] and then what's that condition where you
[2:02:15] don't want to eat cuz I'm so fat.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Anorexia. Yeah. I'm so fat. You know,
[2:02:20] everybody's taking photos and selfies
[2:02:22] and good times and and then she goes
[2:02:25] into that way because I see I you know
[2:02:27] I'm so fat and I'm so big. She wasn't.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; It's a lie from the devil.
[2:02:33] You're not beautiful. You're not pretty.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; You're just going to be an old nag.
[2:02:38] Nobody's ever going to want to marry
[2:02:40] you. You don't have no friends because
[2:02:42] of your nose or your toes.
[2:02:48] And it drugged this YOUNG LADY'S HEART.
[2:02:50] SHE'S RAISED IN THE MESSAGE. IT DRUG HER
[2:02:53] HEART OUT INTO THE WORLD. SHE ENDS up
[2:02:55] going to another country, marrying a
[2:02:57] Muslim. Now she's just divided from her
[2:02:59] family. And it all becomes opposite. and
[2:03:02] against. Let me just say this today in
[2:03:04] behalf of of of your parents. If you've
[2:03:07] been raised in the message, you are
[2:03:09] privileged.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; If you raised in a HOME THAT DOES NOT
[2:03:13] GLORIFY TELEVISION, YOU ARE PRIVILEGED.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A FATHER OR MOTHER that
[2:03:21] wants to limit your uh cell phone time
[2:03:24] and your TIME TO WHERE YOU CAN'T EVEN
[2:03:27] SIT AROUND THE TABLE WITHOUT GETTING ON
[2:03:29] YOUR DEVICE. AND THERE'S A DAD OR
[2:03:31] THERE'S A MOM SAYING, "CAN'T WE JUST
[2:03:33] HAVE A MEAL TOGETHER AND TALK TOGETHER?"
[2:03:37] WELL, YOU KNOW this and THAT. AND WE
[2:03:39] BECOME A GENERATION OF FIGHTERS AND
[2:03:41] AGAINST AND OPPOSED.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A MOTHER OR A FATHER
[2:03:45] THAT'S LIKE THAT, YOU OUGHT TO SAY,
[2:03:47] "PRAISE GOD."
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; I didn't expect a lot of amens
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; because if the parents say amen and then
[2:03:55] the young people, BUT IT'S TRUE. YES.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN LOOK AT THE WALLS as being bad.
[2:04:01] I can't go out. OR YOU CAN LOOK AT IT
[2:04:03] THAT THESE ARE WALLS THAT PROTECTION FOR
[2:04:05] me
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; and I WANT TO GROW UP TO LEARN to say,
[2:04:07] "Thank you, Lord. I have a father and a
[2:04:10] mother." Maybe you're a single parent.
[2:04:12] Maybe you've been raised in a single
[2:04:13] parent and she tried.
[2:04:16] Your mother tried.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; MAYBE SHE'S NOT EVEN IN THE MESSAGE, BUT
[2:04:22] THE FATHER WALKED OUT. MAYBE IT WAS
[2:04:24] ALCOHOL.
[2:04:28] Maybe you're the black sheep of the
[2:04:29] family.
[2:04:31] And I don't mean your color. I mean IT
[2:04:33] JUST SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE HAD IT ROUGH FROM
[2:04:35] WHEN YOU WERE BORN FROM SCHOOL. THEY
[2:04:38] BULLY YOU. They hate you. THEY TALK
[2:04:40] ABOUT YOUR HAIR. THEY TALK ABOUT YOUR
[2:04:42] DRESS. THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID
[2:04:45] FRIDAY NIGHT OR WHAT YOU DID ON THE
[2:04:47] WEEKEND AND and you're just boring. AND
[2:04:50] YOU CAN GET A complex
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; and it just SETS UP A WARING. IT SETS UP
[2:04:54] A FIGHTING. I PRAY IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[2:04:58] THESE TYPE OF MEETINGS LIKE THIS AND AND
[2:05:00] SERVICES THAT YOU CAN GO OUT OF HERE
[2:05:02] SAYING I CAN BE A CHRISTIAN.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; I HAVE GODLY PARENTS.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO SAY THIS TO THE YOUNG
[2:05:10] PEOPLE. WE ARE TRYING.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; AND IN SPITE OF OUR FAILURES,
[2:05:18] GOD IS GOING TO BRING YOU THROUGH. AMEN.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; G.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; And I have to make a public apology
[2:05:28] to every person here, and I mean this
[2:05:30] seriously.
[2:05:33] If there has ever been anything that has
[2:05:36] happened to you that has offended you in
[2:05:40] this message,
[2:05:42] I'm sorry.
[2:05:47] That happened in that church. That
[2:05:48] happened in the youth group and YOU'VE
[2:05:51] PULLED AWAY. THAT HAPPENED IN MINISTERS,
[2:05:53] YOU KNOW, MINISTERS. BUT THAT'S WHERE
[2:05:55] BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "I ALWAYS GOT IN
[2:05:56] TROUBLE WAS AROUND the ministers."
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN BECOME AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.
[2:06:04] We can always see it opposite.
[2:06:09] Do
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; you understand why when I was praying
[2:06:11] this morning why I just feel Lord if I
[2:06:13] say that
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; it's THINGS LIKE THIS
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING INTO DELICATE AREAS AND
[2:06:20] BROTHER JOHN
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT A PROPHET BUT THERE IS A GIFT in
[2:06:24] my life AND WHEN YOU GO INTO CERTAIN
[2:06:26] AREAS AND THE LORD JUST GO THERE JUST
[2:06:28] SAY THAT THAT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT WE AT
[2:06:30] SOME POINT WE GOT TO SAY LORD YOU KNOW
[2:06:32] ALL ABOUT MY LIFE ABOUT MY FAMILY AND
[2:06:35] IT'S YOUR GRACE AND MERCY THAT YOU WOULD
[2:06:37] EVEN TALK TO US LIKE THIS.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; I'm thinking of a four-year-old little
[2:06:45] boy that in the time of trouble and his
[2:06:48] dad is dying and his grandpa's dying.
[2:06:52] One was the king and one was the prince.
[2:06:56] And his his maid hears that the dad has
[2:07:00] gone and she lifts him up and starts
[2:07:03] running and she trips and falls
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; and he BECOMES LAME.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; FOUR YEARS OLD. She picked him up, I'm
[2:07:12] sure, screaming and crying AND THEY WENT
[2:07:15] TO LOABAR. THEY WENT TO A PLACE MILES
[2:07:17] AWAY WHERE THERE'S NO CELL PHONE
[2:07:19] SERVICE. THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE WANT
[2:07:22] this new king
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; to come and
[2:07:27] because IF THEY FIND OUT THAT HE'S
[2:07:29] ALIVE, THEY'RE GOING TO KILL HIM. HE IS
[2:07:31] THE next prince in line
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; and they're going to hate you. THEY'RE
[2:07:35] GOING TO HE LIVED FOR 16 YEARS
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; THROUGH HIS TEENAGE YEARS, THROUGH THE
[2:07:42] PRIME OF HIS LIFE.
[2:07:47] And some of our young people deal with
[2:07:49] pornography.
[2:07:51] They deal with things that are are 10
[2:07:53] times worse. And the music
[2:07:57] is mastered in hell and designed
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; TO DRAG YOUR SOUL INTO HELL. THAT'S
[2:08:04] RIGHT.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; AND THE FASHION DESIGNERS OF CLOTHES,
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE ANOINTED BY HELL TO MAKE IT
[2:08:12] SEXUAL.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; TO PUT ATTENTION TO PLACES THAT OUGHT
[2:08:16] NOT TO BE ATTENTION TO BY A HOLY GHOST
[2:08:20] FIL SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD. And the
[2:08:22] church says,
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; AND OUR FASHION DESIGNERS, AND THEY COME
[2:08:26] OUT OF PARIS OR HOLLYWOOD OR AUCKLAND or
[2:08:29] Wellington, CHRIST CHURCH, WHEREVER, BUT
[2:08:31] THEY'RE NOT BORN AGAIN BELIEVERS.
[2:08:37] and they become skin tight.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; It becomes where young ladies want to
[2:08:42] play the part and leave the house with
[2:08:43] my skirt on and then just roll up my
[2:08:45] leggings and then when I get to school
[2:08:47] and I'm going to the, you know, the the
[2:08:49] washroom, restroom, Lou, whatever you
[2:08:51] call it, and I change and now I'm cool.
[2:08:53] Now I'm out here. Now I'm myself. Then
[2:08:55] at 3:00, I'm back in the locker room
[2:08:57] back in and I'm going to change and get
[2:08:58] my dress on and go out and see my mama.
[2:09:03] and they live a fake life.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; I've personally heard of young ladies
[2:09:11] that were at the altar and they're
[2:09:13] screaming and in THE SPIRIT AND DOING
[2:09:15] ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN THE MEETINGS and
[2:09:16] then in between the services they're
[2:09:18] fixing their makeup in between the
[2:09:20] services in the dorm rooms. Something's
[2:09:23] wrong somewhere.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING'S WRONG WHERE WE GLORIFY
[2:09:28] CERTAIN THINGS OVER HERE. THE PUBLIC
[2:09:30] PART OF BEING A CHRISTIAN, BEING IN THE
[2:09:32] MESSAGE. THIS IS GOOD. THIS IS A REVIVAL
[2:09:35] YET IT PRODUCES SOMETHING OVER HERE AND
[2:09:37] IT'S NOT MATCHING.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; AND I SAY, GOD, GIVE US A REAL HOLY
[2:09:42] GHOST REVIVAL.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; AND that starts with repentance.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; WHERE I CAN LAY MYSELF AT THE ALTAR. I
[2:09:49] LAY MY LIFE BEFORE YOU. NOT TO WHERE I
[2:09:52] WANT TO LEAVE and then get myself all
[2:09:54] together and then SING IN THE NIGHT
[2:09:55] SERVICE like I'm the greatest singer in
[2:09:57] the message. No, you're not. We need
[2:09:59] more humble SISTERS THAT ARE JUST broken
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; that can stand up and sing a song from
[2:10:05] their heart
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; and all of A SUDDEN THEIR VOICE STARTS
[2:10:08] BREAKING AND CRACKING AND THEY BREAK
[2:10:10] INTO TEARS. THAT IS WHEN THE
[2:10:12] CONGREGATION, YOU'LL NOTICE THEY BEGIN
[2:10:14] TO MOVE
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT'S SOMETHING FROM THE HEART AND
[2:10:17] IT'S NOT A PUBLIC SHOW.
[2:10:20] GOD, HELP OUR CHURCH SERVICES NOT TO BE
[2:10:22] FOR THE YOUTUBE CHANNEL
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; OR HOW MANY LIKES WE CAN GET OR HOW MANY
[2:10:27] PEOPLE FOLLOW US.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; YOU FOLLOW CHRIST, YOU'RE GOING TO BE
[2:10:31] REJECTED AND DESPISED. PEOPLE ARE GOING
[2:10:34] TO HATE YOU.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; You You say you're thinking in the
[2:10:42] world. No, in the message.
[2:10:46] They want to stay comfortable in their
[2:10:49] little bubble and nobody say anything
[2:10:52] that'll break my bubble. Don't come into
[2:10:54] my private life. Let's let James talk to
[2:10:57] us for a few minutes before our lunch.
[2:10:59] Are you all doing okay?
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; From whence come wars and fightings
[2:11:03] among you. Come not hints even of your
[2:11:06] lust that war in your members. Can you
[2:11:08] all see that on the screen?
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Ye lust and have not. Ye kill and desire
[2:11:12] to have and cannot obtain. Ye fight and
[2:11:15] war, yet you have not because you ask
[2:11:18] not. Ye ask and receive not because you
[2:11:21] ask a miss that you might consume it
[2:11:23] upon your lust.
[2:11:28] In the Hebrew series, he said, "YOU
[2:11:30] PEOPLE WITH THESE SAWBLADE tempers
[2:11:33] that's always spouting off with the
[2:11:34] mouth at somebody, can't put up and
[2:11:37] things LIKE THAT, BE CAREFUL. You're
[2:11:39] guilty if you speak a word against your
[2:11:42] brother that's not right." and not just
[2:11:45] GO AROUND AND TEAR DOWN AND YOU DON'T
[2:11:48] HAVE TO STICK A KNIFE IN A MAN'S back to
[2:11:50] kill him. You can break his character
[2:11:53] and kill him and kill his influence.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; say, "I'm guilty, Brother John. I'm
[2:12:02] guilty of murder."
[2:12:04] That's not the unpardonable sin. That's
[2:12:07] right.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Ask God to forgive you and say, "From
[2:12:12] this moment on, I will not allow that
[2:12:14] spirit to rule my life."
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Think about it. What's going to WHAT'S
[2:12:22] IT GOING TO TAKE TO DEAL WITH THE CHURCH
[2:12:24] GOSSIPER?
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE HOLY SPIRIT. THEY
[2:12:28] THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR SO MANY MONTHS
[2:12:30] AND YEARS, THEY'RE PROBABLY THINK
[2:12:31] THEY'RE THE SPIRITUAL ONE IN THE CHURCH.
[2:12:33] IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE HOLY SPIRIT TO
[2:12:35] WORK IN THAT CHURCH GOSSIPER.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Stop it today.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Speak against your pastor. Say something
[2:12:49] bad about him. You might as just well
[2:12:51] shot him,
[2:12:53] TOLD SOMETHING THAT WASN'T RIGHT ABOUT
[2:12:55] HIM. WELL, it'll kill his influence with
[2:12:58] the people and things like that. AND
[2:12:59] YOU'RE GUILTY of it.
[2:13:08] Maybe you don't deal with it like we do
[2:13:10] in America, but over in America, there's
[2:13:12] a lot of guns and ammo and shooting and
[2:13:15] knives.
[2:13:18] And you have people that are all caught
[2:13:20] up in war games and movies of violence
[2:13:24] and rock and roll and heavy metal ROCK
[2:13:27] MUSIC. IT WILL TAKE YOUR SOUL TO HELL.
[2:13:31] AMEN.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU FEEL comfortable singing the
[2:13:38] same type of SONGS AND IN THE SAME TYPE
[2:13:40] OF MOVEMENTS AS SOMEBODY THAT'S NOT
[2:13:42] GOING TO BE MAKE IT IN THE RAPTURE? I'M
[2:13:45] JUST ASKING you the question.
[2:13:48] You do whatever you want to do. HOWEVER
[2:13:50] YOU LIVE AFTER camp is between you and
[2:13:53] God.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'RE A LEADER, EVERYONE
[2:13:56] UNDERNEATH you will come under that.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S WHY IT'S A WARNING. THAT'S WHY
[2:14:00] IT'S WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT. BE CAREFUL.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE LISTENING TO SONGS THAT ARE LIKE
[2:14:05] THAT AND AND YOU'RE WATCHING MOVIES AND
[2:14:07] THEN YOU'RE PLAY AND THEN YOU'RE PLAYING
[2:14:09] WAR GAMES.
[2:14:16] What's on the posters on your wall is
[2:14:19] warships and fighter planes.
[2:14:23] I'm not speaking against that. I'm just
[2:14:24] saying just watch your nature and what
[2:14:27] you're forming in yourself. Remember,
[2:14:30] BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKING ABOUT THE
[2:14:31] picture of the warships that were in
[2:14:34] that that family's bedroom and they
[2:14:37] wondered why every single one of the
[2:14:39] young men went to the Navy
[2:14:43] and they started investigating. One
[2:14:45] after the other after the other went to
[2:14:48] the Navy.
[2:14:50] Y'ALL KNOW THE STORY. AND THEY
[2:14:52] RESEARCHED IT AND WENT BACK AND THEY
[2:14:53] FOUND IT WAS A PICTURE OF A BIG WARSHIP
[2:14:56] IN THEIR IN THEIR BEDROOM THAT WAS ON A
[2:14:58] CALM SEA.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; That's what they saw in the morning.
[2:15:03] That's what they saw at NIGHT WAS A
[2:15:05] WARSHIP OUT ON A CALM SEA JUST MOVING
[2:15:07] ALONG. AND ALL OF THOSE YOUNG MEN WENT
[2:15:10] TO THE NAVY. I SAY, GOD, IF IT'S THAT
[2:15:13] POWERFUL,
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; PUT YOUR HOLY SPIRIT INTO OUR ROOMS.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; PUT A HOFFMAN'S HEAD INTO OUR ROOMS.
[2:15:20] DON'T MAKE AN IDOL OF OUR PROPHET, BUT
[2:15:22] WE NEED TO BRING THAT ATMOSPHERE INTO
[2:15:24] OUR HOMES.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm not speaking about a religious
[2:15:28] spirit.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; You can play them 24 hours, 24/7, but if
[2:15:33] we don't have the spirit of Christ,
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; I pray God's blessings upon New Zealand,
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; upon your churches, upon your families.
[2:15:48] I speak the name of Jesus over to you
[2:15:51] that our songs would be healing and
[2:15:52] deliverance. David played THE HARP AND
[2:15:55] EVIL SPIRITS went out of Saul.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; HE GRABBED A JAVELIN AND WANTED TO
[2:15:59] DESTROY DAVID AND DAVID HAD SO MUCH OF
[2:16:02] THE NATURE OF CHRIST IN HIM. HE PLAYED
[2:16:04] THAT HARP AND THE EVIL SPIRIT LEFT SAUL.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; All the time HE'S PLAYING WITH HIS
[2:16:08] JAVELIN LOOKING HOW HE'S going to
[2:16:10] destroy his character. But David was a
[2:16:12] man of God.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; He was already anointed to be king. He
[2:16:15] didn't need a the big uh you know things
[2:16:17] going around. Rah rah rah you know
[2:16:19] David's killed his thousand
[2:16:22] Saul has killed David his 10. He didn't
[2:16:24] need all the women screaming his name.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL WHEN ALL PEOPLE SPEAK WELL OF
[2:16:31] YOU.
[2:16:37] You know, you go back to our opening
[2:16:38] scripture, and I I'm mindful of our
[2:16:40] lunchtime coming up in 2 Samuel chapter
[2:16:44] 2. We read about Abnner and Joab and
[2:16:47] bringing the young people into it.
[2:16:48] Pretty soon you have 24 young people in
[2:16:51] the message laying around. There should
[2:16:53] have been some godly mother went
[2:16:55] screaming out through THERE AND SAID,
[2:16:56] "STOP IT.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT." YEAH.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; There should have been some father say,
[2:17:05] "What did we raise our young people for?
[2:17:07] They're dying all around us."
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Why do they keep leaving when they're
[2:17:11] 14? Don't want to go to church. 15, we
[2:17:13] struggle with them coming. 16, okay, you
[2:17:16] can stay home Wednesday, then it's
[2:17:18] Sunday, then I'm sick. Then by the 16,
[2:17:21] 17, THEY'RE REBELLIOUS. They're
[2:17:23] stubborn.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; And I JUST ASK FOR FORGIVENESS. LORD,
[2:17:28] WHERE DID WE GO WRONG? WHAT CAN WE DO
[2:17:30] NOW?
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; What could we do now, Lord?
[2:17:41] Brother Brandham said it was Jesus
[2:17:43] Christ and Moses. Jesus Christ in Noah.
[2:17:46] Jesus Christ in Moses. Jesus Christ in
[2:17:48] David. Jesus Christ and Joseph. It's
[2:17:50] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[2:17:52] and forever. It's Jesus Christ among his
[2:17:55] people today
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; doing the things that he promised he
[2:17:58] would do in this age. It's Jesus Christ
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; and and we say amen to that.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; But the church has become so starchy and
[2:18:05] so far away. Like the brother said, our
[2:18:07] churches are becoming the same way. So
[2:18:09] we've got to have something to shake us
[2:18:11] back to the word. How do we know it's
[2:18:14] going to do it? IT'S GOT TO COME
[2:18:16] ACCORDING TO GOD'S PLAN. GOD'S PLAN IS
[2:18:19] NO CIVIL WAR.
[2:18:22] AMEN.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Watch the nature of Christ in David.
[2:18:26] Watch him when David was leaving out of
[2:18:28] the city and Shimi is throwing rocks and
[2:18:31] all the gravel and cursing and swearing.
[2:18:34] Shimi was a lot of church people. They
[2:18:35] take advantage of when they think it's
[2:18:37] going good and they're on a roll,
[2:18:39] THEY'RE JUST TEARING IT UP. That's
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Shimi.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; David's leaving the city. his son
[2:18:45] Abselam's taking over the church causing
[2:18:48] a split and all kinds of things are
[2:18:50] David could have stayed THERE AND FOUGHT
[2:18:51] BUT he was a real man OF GOD HE SAID
[2:18:53] LET'S LEAVE LET'S GET OUT OF HERE WE
[2:18:55] DON'T WANT conflict
[2:18:57] Shimi took advantage of all that and
[2:18:59] such cursing and swearing and little did
[2:19:02] David know that 800 years after that the
[2:19:04] son of David sat on a hill that was the
[2:19:06] spirit of Christ in David somebody SAID
[2:19:09] HERE I'LL TAKE OFF HIS HEAD HE TALK
[2:19:11] ABOUT MY KING LIKE THAT AND DAVID said
[2:19:12] let him alone the Lord told him to do
[2:19:15] that.
[2:19:16] Little did we know years later, Brother
[2:19:18] Brandham was going to say the same thing
[2:19:21] in a tax case and under pressure in his
[2:19:23] HOME AND THEY'RE SPOOTING OFF. SOMEONE
[2:19:24] SAID, "OH, THE LAWYERS, THEY'RE THIS,
[2:19:26] THAT, AND AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID,
[2:19:28] MAYBE THE LORD TOLD HIM to do that."
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; SEE, HE BROUGHT THE WORD INTO HIS DAILY
[2:19:34] LIFE. IT WAS JUST AUTOMATIC
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WAS ON THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
[2:19:38] INSTEAD OF JUST FIGHTING AND WAR. OH,
[2:19:40] that that attorney's not a believer.
[2:19:43] He's not a Christian. It doesn't matter.
[2:19:45] THAT'S NOT HOW HIS attitude was.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "I I TOLD MY WIFE TO LIE. IT
[2:19:51] WAS A WHITE LIE. TELL HIM I'M NOT HERE."
[2:19:53] IT WAS THE PRESSURE I WAS UNDER.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Y'all remember brother Brandham's first
[2:20:04] wife that passed away and her dying
[2:20:08] deathbed.
[2:20:10] Can I say this?
[2:20:12] She's I have something to tell you.
[2:20:13] She's passing away. Tuberculosis
[2:20:16] up there in Charles Town and it's
[2:20:17] flooded out and everything and she's
[2:20:19] ready to pass away. The thing that comes
[2:20:21] to her mind is back something that
[2:20:24] happened way before when we were going
[2:20:26] up to some meetings and brother Brandham
[2:20:28] went out to buy some stockings for her
[2:20:30] rayon chiffon. Ranch chiffon rayon
[2:20:32] chiffon. What kind of you know do they
[2:20:34] like this tile? Do they like this? Is it
[2:20:36] socks? Is it this rayon chiffon? He goes
[2:20:38] into a place. My I they're so cheap.
[2:20:41] I'll just buy two pair. And he buys two
[2:20:43] pair and so proud of himself comes back,
[2:20:45] gives them to his wife. And and then he
[2:20:48] wondered why in the next town they that
[2:20:50] she had to go buy some new ones. And
[2:20:52] here she's BRINGING IT UP ALL ON HER
[2:20:54] DEATHBED. She said, "Forgive me, Bill.
[2:20:56] Those those stockings you got were for
[2:20:58] older women.
[2:21:02] Forgive me.
[2:21:04] So sensitive.
[2:21:07] So sensitive.
[2:21:12] just so sensitive
[2:21:14] in relationships.
[2:21:18] God, help us to be a leader in New
[2:21:19] Zealand
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; of ending any type of wars or fight. You
[2:21:24] be the peacemaker.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; You be the person that says there's not
[2:21:29] going to be that.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be the person.
[2:21:37] I have this scripture here. But I'm just
[2:21:38] going to 2 Samuel 18
[2:21:44] verse 4-1 17 if you'd like to write it
[2:21:47] down.
[2:21:54] This is when David's son was causing
[2:21:56] trouble in the church and in the
[2:21:58] message. He's rebellious.
[2:22:01] David, the king said unto them, "What
[2:22:03] seemth you best I will do?" And the king
[2:22:05] stood by the gates, and all the people
[2:22:07] came out by hundreds and by thousands.
[2:22:09] And the king commanded Joab and Epici
[2:22:12] and saying, "Deal gently for my sake
[2:22:15] with the young men, even with Abselam."
[2:22:17] And all the people heard when the king
[2:22:19] gave all the CAPTAIN'S CHARGE. BE GOOD
[2:22:22] TO HIM.
[2:22:24] HE'S CAUSING A SPLIT IN HIS CHURCH. HE'S
[2:22:26] BREAKING UP THE FAMILY. And David said,
[2:22:29] "When you find him, be gentle with him.
[2:22:33] Verse
[2:22:35] 6, the people went out into the field
[2:22:37] against Israel. This is 2 Samuel 18:6.
[2:22:41] And there was a battle there. Verse 7.
[2:22:44] And the people of Israel were slain
[2:22:45] before the servants of David. And there
[2:22:47] was a ve a great slaughter that day of
[2:22:50] 20,000
[2:22:52] believers,
[2:22:54] men, PEOPLE IN THE MESSAGE. 20,000 died
[2:22:59] in this war.
[2:23:03] Have I flooded your mind with too much
[2:23:05] today? There ought to have been somebody
[2:23:07] stand up in some camp, some meeting AND
[2:23:09] SAY, "STOP IT. PEOPLE ARE DYING.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Look at the direction you're going."
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; For the battle, verse eight, was their
[2:23:22] seed scattered over the face of all the
[2:23:24] country, and the wood devoured more
[2:23:28] people that day than the sword devoured.
[2:23:30] That is their environment that they were
[2:23:32] fighting in woods. They were fighting in
[2:23:34] in an atmosphere. They were fighting in
[2:23:36] Leodysia. Can I say it like that? AND
[2:23:38] THE WOOD DEVOURED MORE OF THE BELIEVERS
[2:23:40] THAN THE SWORD DID. IN OTHER WORDS, IF
[2:23:42] YOU GIVE YOURSELF TO BEING WARLIKE AND
[2:23:44] FIGHTING, IT WILL DESTROY YOU.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Let me find a place to get off. God,
[2:23:57] help us not to be a fighting people.
[2:24:00] Help us not to be a fighting
[2:24:01] congregation.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Help us not to be fighting in our
[2:24:05] families.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Superior pride and hottiness better than
[2:24:11] everyone else. That's not one of the
[2:24:13] fruits of the spirit.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; You find when brother Brandham even with
[2:24:18] nature speaks better of that. When he
[2:24:20] was before the bull,
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; it was love.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; He said something came over me.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Do you all remember that? when when the
[2:24:29] all the hornets CAME OUT AND HE DROVE
[2:24:31] HIS LAWN MOWER. He's busy. He drove it
[2:24:33] into the hornets AND THEY ALL CAME
[2:24:35] BUZZING AROUND. HE HAD HIS SHIRT OFF CUZ
[2:24:37] IT WAS HOT THERE IN INDIANA AND THEY
[2:24:38] CAME and they're all coming around. He
[2:24:40] said, "I'm so sorry." He spoke. God
[2:24:43] speaks to nature.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SPEAK THIS AFTERNOON DIFFERENTLY
[2:24:47] THAN WHEN YOU WALKED IN THE ROOM.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; IT JUST HAPPENS WHEN IT'S THE HOLY
[2:24:53] SPIRIT COMING ON YOU. IT'S LOVE COMING
[2:24:55] ON YOU. THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT MANIAC, I WAS READING IT THIS
[2:24:59] MORNING, CAME UP ON THE PLATFORM. EVEN
[2:25:01] THE EVEN the policemen were afraid of
[2:25:04] him, HE CAME RUNNING UP ON THE PLATFORM
[2:25:06] AND WAS GOING TO TAKE BROTHER BRANDHAM
[2:25:08] OUT. And brother Brandham standing there
[2:25:11] and and the policemen were all there
[2:25:13] like deacons. Should we stop him? He
[2:25:14] said, just let him come. He wasn't
[2:25:16] afraid. He started thinking about maybe
[2:25:18] he has a family, MAYBE HE HAS A WIFE,
[2:25:21] MAYBE HE HAS CHILDREN. Something come
[2:25:23] over him. It was love. Amen.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Said before you knew it, that man fell
[2:25:27] over brother Brennham's feet like this
[2:25:29] and they asked, "Is he delivered?" HE'S
[2:25:31] NOT DELIVERED. HE worships that thing.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; GOD FORGIVE US IF WE WALK OUT OF THIS
[2:25:37] SERVICE AND START KEEP WORSHIPING THAT
[2:25:39] VIOLENT SPIRIT.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; WE'RE LIVING IN A LAND OF VIOLENCE
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; AND A young man just IN HIS IN THE
[2:25:45] PRIVACY OF HIS ROOM OR EVEN UH BROTHERS
[2:25:48] CAN GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS IN THE MESSAGE
[2:25:50] AND IT'S war games and killing them.
[2:26:02] And we have some of our ministers and
[2:26:04] older ones that have come up through the
[2:26:05] drug era through the 60s and you come ON
[2:26:08] MY BLOCK, YOU DO IT MY way or hit the
[2:26:11] next block, buddy. And that becomes
[2:26:13] THEIR LANGUAGE. THAT BECOMES HOW THEY
[2:26:15] TALK TO THE PEOPLE.
[2:26:20] You come into my city, you start another
[2:26:22] church, you do something different. I'm
[2:26:24] going to take you out. I'm going to
[2:26:25] destroy you.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; That's not the Holy Spirit.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't do that.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Ruddle had a CHURCH TWO MILES UP
[2:26:37] FROM THE Brandom Tabernacle.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; BROTHER JUNIOR JACKSON IS 5 MILES AWAY
[2:26:42] from the Brandom Tabernacle.
[2:26:44] UDICA WAS JUST VERY, VERY CLOSE TO THE
[2:26:47] BRHAM TABERNACLE. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[2:26:49] DEDICATED churches in Clarksville, spoke
[2:26:51] in Louisville, and he didn't feel
[2:26:53] intimidated.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "They come in here and empty
[2:26:56] this place out, well, we'll just keep
[2:26:58] preaching and fill it up again."
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T INTIMIDATED BY THESE BROTHERS.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; YET, some of us in THE MESSAGE, WE WE
[2:27:06] WOULD TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST THEM. We
[2:27:07] would, YOU KNOW, THIS AND WE'D BUILD
[2:27:09] CASTLES.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Tear down your castles.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE.
[2:27:17] WE LOOK AT THE SAME Shemi if you want to
[2:27:19] look it up in first kings. David's
[2:27:22] passing away and he said there was three
[2:27:24] things he he wanted Solomon to deal with
[2:27:26] and one of them was Shimi. Take care of
[2:27:29] that that man in your church.
[2:27:32] He's trying to undermine you.
[2:27:35] That spirit will destroy the sheep.
[2:27:38] Cursing, swearing, taking advantage.
[2:27:40] Loud, boisterous. It's my way, brother.
[2:27:43] In church meetings.
[2:27:48] How many desire to come to this statue
[2:27:50] of a perfect man? I put that on the
[2:27:52] screen. Who desires to come to the
[2:27:54] statue?
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; Just lift your hand up as a testimony to
[2:27:58] the Lord.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Have y'all ever counted those? Faith,
[2:28:03] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[2:28:05] godliness. Number seven is brotherly
[2:28:07] kindness.
[2:28:09] That's le oysia.
[2:28:12] Say, BUT WE'RE IN THE BRIDE AGE. WE'VE
[2:28:13] COME FURTHER. ABSOLUTELY. BUT THE IT'S
[2:28:16] IT SHOULD BE GRACE AND LOVE CAPPING OFF
[2:28:18] OUR LIVES.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; But how MANY ARE TRYING TO GO AND AVOID
[2:28:22] BROTHERLY KINDNESS?
[2:28:33] are trying to avoid brotherly kindness
[2:28:36] and they talk ABOUT LOVE, PREACH ABOUT
[2:28:38] LOVE,
[2:28:40] have a 10- part series on love, yet
[2:28:43] they're skipping around brotherly
[2:28:45] kindness. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID
[2:28:47] THAT'S HONEY IN THE box
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; and in blasphemous names. The sister
[2:28:52] THAT THAT WONDERED WHY THAT SHE WOULD GO
[2:28:54] TO MEETINGS AND THE WATER WAS BEING
[2:28:57] POURED INTO HER BOX AND IT WAS GOOD AND
[2:28:59] good services and good meetings, but it
[2:29:01] was just flowing right out. And it was
[2:29:02] just going right OUT AND WONDER WHY. I
[2:29:04] WONDER IF I HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. I
[2:29:06] WONDER. And he said, "Sister, you just
[2:29:08] need honey in the box."
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; And you POUR IN THE POUR IN THE WATER
[2:29:12] AND IT'LL IT'LL HOLD IT.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Blasphemous names. Go read it.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness is honey in the box.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; It's love MIXED DOWN INTO BROTHERLY
[2:29:26] KINDNESS. THAT'S THE THAT IS THE
[2:29:29] ANOINTING THAT WILL COMBAT THE AGE WE'RE
[2:29:31] LIVING IN. BUT THE BRIDE IS COMING UP
[2:29:34] HIGHER THAN THAT.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; BUT PERFECT LOVE WILL NEVER SETTLE DOWN
[2:29:38] UPON A LIFE THAT DOESN'T have brotherly
[2:29:40] kindness. Never.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; Can we all say never?
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Never. You can scream, shout, have loud
[2:29:48] music, have the best preachers. Brother
[2:29:51] Brandham could be your pastor,
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; but if you don't have brotherly
[2:29:55] kindness,
[2:29:59] That love has nothing to settle on.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Has this been okay today?
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; I'm winning to your afternoon and
[2:30:10] [applause]
[2:30:19] [applause]
[2:30:21] I begin to move from that beautiful
[2:30:23] joyful place. Brother Isaac and and
[2:30:26] musicians just in a few minutes I want
[2:30:27] you to come. As far as my eyes could
[2:30:30] see, people were coming towards me,
[2:30:32] embracing me, crying, my precious
[2:30:34] brother.
[2:30:35] Suddenly, I was back on the bed again
[2:30:39] beyond the curtain of time.
[2:30:41] I was back on the bed again.
[2:31:04] I said, "Oh God, help me.
[2:31:07] NEVER LET ME COMPROMISE WITH THE WORD.
[2:31:10] LET ME STAY STRAIGHT ON THE WORD. I
[2:31:13] DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY else does, Lord.
[2:31:15] Let me press on to that beautiful,
[2:31:18] joyful place. This is what a
[2:31:20] supernatural experience does for an
[2:31:22] individual. IT CAUSES YOU TO LOOK
[2:31:24] INWARD.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; It's me, oh Lord.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS THE PROBLEM.
[2:31:30] It's me. Is it me, Lord? Let me press.
[2:31:33] The Lord, help me. I'm so convinced.
[2:31:37] I'm more convinced than ever in my life
[2:31:39] that it will take perfect love to enter
[2:31:41] that place. There was no jealousy, no
[2:31:45] tiredness, no sickness, no old age,
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; no death, only supreme beauty and joy.
[2:31:53] Hallelujah.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do,
[2:31:59] lay aside everything else until you get
[2:32:01] perfect love.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; Get to where you can love everybody,
[2:32:05] even every enemy. No matter no matter if
[2:32:08] the plane is rocking, the lightning is
[2:32:11] flashing, or the guns of the enemy are
[2:32:13] upon you. These things do not matter.
[2:32:16] Get perfect love. You might BE IN A
[2:32:19] HORRIBLE RELATIONSHIP. YOU MIGHT BE IN A
[2:32:22] CHURCH THAT has been NASTY AND BAD. YOU
[2:32:24] MIGHT WANT TO BE LEAVING YOUR JOB OR
[2:32:26] GOING TO ANOTHER SCHOOL, AND I DON'T
[2:32:28] BLAME YOU.
[2:32:32] But the main thing is get perfect love.
[2:32:35] If you're not saved, accept Jesus Christ
[2:32:37] as your savior.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; Next Sunday,
[2:32:41] this afternoon, no. Now,
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; just take him right there in YOUR SEAT
[2:32:46] THERE. JUST SAY, "LORD, FORGIVE ME. I'VE
[2:32:48] BEEN WRONG.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; TAKE AWAY FROM ME ANY ARROGANCY OR
[2:32:52] PRIDE. IF I'D BEEN GUILTY OF CAUSING
[2:32:55] TROUBLE FOR ANOTHER BROTHER, OH GOD,
[2:32:58] FORGIVE ME, LORD.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T REALIZE, SISTER, THAT IT WAS
[2:33:01] AFFECTING YOU LIKE THAT.
[2:33:06] Is brother Joel Brother Seth here today?
[2:33:09] Is Brother Seth here?
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Seth. Brother Seth, can you come
[2:33:14] out for a second?
[2:33:21] I just want to demonstrate a little
[2:33:23] something. God bless you, brother Seth.
[2:33:26] You know,
[2:33:28] and then we need to speak to our young
[2:33:29] people and speak to one another like
[2:33:31] this.
[2:33:34] Brother Seth,
[2:33:35] if there's ever been anything that has
[2:33:37] happened
[2:33:41] while you're growing up, how old are you
[2:33:42] now?
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; 20.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; 20. If there's ever been anything that
[2:33:47] has happened in your life that's
[2:33:50] offended you, I'm sorry.
[2:33:55] in your school, in your family,
[2:33:59] something at church, something in New
[2:34:02] Zealand, something you heard from
[2:34:04] America,
[2:34:06] anything
[2:34:09] that would offend your heart and
[2:34:14] just cause you to to have anguish in
[2:34:17] your spirit.
[2:34:21] I'm sorry.
[2:34:26] Maybe it was a girl. Maybe it was a boy.
[2:34:29] Maybe it's something that nobody knows
[2:34:30] about. Maybe it's become public. Maybe
[2:34:32] it's very public now and and you all
[2:34:34] know cuz you live in New Zealand.
[2:34:36] Brother John's far away. Maybe it was
[2:34:38] something on Youth Without Borders.
[2:34:43] If I said anything or if I called you
[2:34:46] out or something embarrassed you,
[2:34:50] I'm sorry.
[2:34:59] It's amazing, you know,
[2:35:02] that elder son of the prodical son, he
[2:35:05] was just as backsliden, paying ti,
[2:35:08] coming to church, had the good looks as
[2:35:10] the prodical son that was out there in
[2:35:12] the world going crazy and wild and
[2:35:14] spinning and going and going and going.
[2:35:16] Thank you, brother Seth.
[2:35:18] That older brother in the message should
[2:35:21] have been texting his brother, "Can I
[2:35:23] come see you? I'm sorry. My heart's
[2:35:26] getting hardened toward you. You
[2:35:28] breaking up our family. You're come.
[2:35:29] You've been raised in the message. You
[2:35:31] know better than this." AND THAT'S NOT
[2:35:33] WHAT HE NEEDED TO HEAR.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; He was just as lost, the elder son,
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; cuz he was too good.
[2:35:42] The Lord's dealing in the service and
[2:35:44] telling the church that you all ought TO
[2:35:46] BE HAPPY AND REJOICE IN THE LORD. GOD'S
[2:35:48] RESTORING. GOD'S DOING THINGS and and he
[2:35:50] just, you know, has another spirit on
[2:35:52] him. Yet, he pays his tithe. He's really
[2:35:54] good. Has a nice clothes.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a sister and SHE'S DRESSING
[2:36:00] THE PART and doing the actions.
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN JUST JUST BE AS BACKSLIDING AS
[2:36:07] ANOTHER PERSON THAT'S IN A VERY HORRIBLE
[2:36:09] DARK. They're both dark.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; A RELIGIOUS SPIRIT'S WORSE THAN A A
[2:36:17] SPIRIT THAT SAYS, "FORGET you all."
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; I don't want to come to your meetings. I
[2:36:24] don't want to come and be around you
[2:36:26] anymore.
[2:36:29] You know, sometimes when a person talks
[2:36:31] to you and
[2:36:33] sorry, brother Isaac, we'll sing in a
[2:36:34] moment, but they'll talk to you and
[2:36:37] share something with you and talk about
[2:36:39] something and THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT
[2:36:41] they want to talk about. They're just
[2:36:44] testing. They're just seeing if you're
[2:36:46] going to be a friend.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; And then after about 35 minutes or so,
[2:36:50] when you think it's all done and you've
[2:36:51] agreed and yeah, that's that that's this
[2:36:53] certain way, then they kind of just say
[2:36:55] something. And that's what it was. And
[2:36:58] we need to be more sensitive to that.
[2:37:00] I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON WHEN
[2:37:02] WE'RE GOING TO GO TO LUNCH in a few
[2:37:04] minutes. God bless you, brother. THERE'S
[2:37:06] PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING THROUGH ISSUES AND
[2:37:08] THINGS,
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; mental things right here among us
[2:37:12] mentally,
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; and struggling.
[2:37:19] Brother Brandham would go right down the
[2:37:20] line and say, "You with cancer, you with
[2:37:22] a female trouble, you with a tumor, you
[2:37:24] this, and you sister behind." And there
[2:37:26] was my there this this would have been
[2:37:29] moved back like this, Brother David. And
[2:37:31] there would have been Cuts and
[2:37:32] stretchers and wheelchairs and young
[2:37:35] people with legs cut off and PEOPLE
[2:37:37] LAYING THERE JUST I'M GOING TO GO
[2:37:38] THROUGH AN HOUR, HOUR AND A HALF
[2:37:40] SERVICE, but I hope they call my number.
[2:37:42] I hope they call my my prayer. I hope
[2:37:44] they call my number. They're just about
[2:37:46] they're just going in and out of pain
[2:37:47] and suffering. IT'S NOT LIKE THAT TODAY.
[2:37:50] WE DON'T HAVE CLOTS AND STRETCHERS AND
[2:37:52] WHEELCHAIRS AND YOU GOT CANCER. You got
[2:37:54] tuberculosis. Oh, you sister back there,
[2:37:56] YOU GOT THIS IN YOUR IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S
[2:37:58] IT'S THINGS THAT ARE SO HIDDEN.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S IN ANOTHER REALM.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; WE'RE FIGHTING AGAINST POWERS AND
[2:38:05] DEMONIC SPIRITS.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; I SAY, GOD, IN THE NAME OF JESUS,
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER IT TAKES, LORD, WE NEED HELP.
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; WE'RE CRYING OUT TO YOU.
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; JESUS, WALK THROUGH OUR SERVICES.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; AND LET THE HYMN AND THE BORDER OF YOUR
[2:38:19] GARMENT, I DON'T EVEN NEED TO TALK TO
[2:38:21] YOU, PREACHER. JUST LET ME TOUCH THE HEM
[2:38:24] OF YOUR GARMENT.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S LOOKING FOR MEN AND WOMEN THAT
[2:38:27] HAVE THAT MUCH POWER IN THEM.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T. BROTHER JONATHAN AND I DON'T
[2:38:31] HAVE A lot of time. We haven't even
[2:38:33] spent hardly any time together. AND
[2:38:35] THERE'S JUST A WALL IN BETWEEN US. HE
[2:38:37] KNOWS THAT. AND I DON'T AND I know that.
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; But the Lord knows everything about
[2:38:43] every single person. How many believe
[2:38:45] that? Your name, your address, YOUR
[2:38:48] ISSUES. WE MIGHT HAVE WENT AN HOUR AND A
[2:38:50] HALF SERVICE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S
[2:38:52] JUST SOMETHING GOD'S GOING TO DROP DOWN
[2:38:53] IN YOUR HEART AND IT'S LIKE A KEY
[2:38:55] TURNING IN THE lock
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; and you LEAVE THAT SERVICE. YOU MIGHT
[2:39:00] NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING THAT WAS ON THE
[2:39:02] SCREEN, BUT ALL YOU KNOW IS GOD CARES.
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; GOD CARES FOR YOU.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; HE LOVES YOU.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:39:12] &gt;&gt; No one's got a gun to your head. No
[2:39:14] one's going to offer you drugs this
[2:39:16] afternoon. Nobody wants to have sex with
[2:39:18] you outside of marriage. No one's
[2:39:20] breaking into your dorm.
[2:39:23] We're not offering you cigarettes. Come
[2:39:26] on, friends. Let's Let's CLOSE THE
[2:39:27] SERVICE. NOBODY'S TRYING TO TAKE YOU TO
[2:39:30] HELL.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; NOBODY IN THIS ROOM WANTS SOMEBODY ELSE
[2:39:33] HERE TO GO TO HELL
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; AND TO HEAR YOUR VOICE IN THE REGIONS OF
[2:39:37] THE LOST.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; NOBODY. AMEN.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; In fact, if all of you were somebody
[2:39:49] somebody here missed the rapture and you
[2:39:50] were on the other side and we were
[2:39:53] believers and we were part of the bride
[2:39:54] and you walked up, I WOULD SAY GIVE HIM
[2:39:57] GRACE.
[2:39:58] &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM MERCY.
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; CAN SOMEBODY SAY AMEN?
[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; OR ARE YOU SO HARDENED AGAINST THAT
[2:40:05] BROTHER, SISTER, THAT OTHER YOUNG PERSON
[2:40:07] YOU TALK BAD AND NASTY? DON'T DO THAT
[2:40:09] TODAY.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; HAVE ENOUGH HOLY GHOST ABOUT YOU TO TO
[2:40:13] JUST ZIP THE LIP.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; BE QUIET. BE SILENT.
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; LISTEN,
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; we're all guilty.
[2:40:23] &gt;&gt; We overt talk one another. We We're not
[2:40:25] We JUST DON'T EVEN CARE. We'll go a
[2:40:27] whole weekend like this. And not even
[2:40:30] listen to somebody else, not even be
[2:40:32] burdened,
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; not even hardly pray. SOMETIMES WE JUST
[2:40:36] GET CAUGHT up in the food.
[2:40:39] or I didn't sleep good.
[2:40:42] Somebody didn't look at me good. I hope
[2:40:44] next year they have another TYPE OF
[2:40:47] SPEAKER. THAT'S ALL FINE.
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETIMES WE JUST NEED THE MEDICINE.
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; We need a scalpel. WE NEED THE WORD TO
[2:40:54] COME DOWN ON THE INSIDE AND START MOVING
[2:40:56] AROUND A LITTLE BIT AND GO DOWN INTO
[2:40:58] THAT PLACE AND THEN CUT AROUND THAT
[2:41:00] ARTERY AND MOVE INTO THAT DELICATE SPOT
[2:41:02] AND BRING OUT THE CANCER, BRING OUT THAT
[2:41:05] CERTAIN TUMOR. And every single person
[2:41:08] HERE, IF YOU HAD A LOVED ONE THAT WAS
[2:41:10] GOING THROUGH A SENSITIVE OPERATION, a
[2:41:12] heart transplant, I DON'T CARE IF IT WAS
[2:41:14] 8 HOURS,
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; you'd be sitting in that waiting room
[2:41:18] praying,
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; DESIRING, SAYING, "GOD, GUIDE THE HANDS
[2:41:22] OF THE PHYSICIAN, BE WITH THE NURSE, AND
[2:41:24] WHY CAN'T WE SPEND AN HOUR, TWO HOURS,
[2:41:27] AND IN PRAYER AND AND MEDITATION AND
[2:41:29] SAYING, GOD, YOU'RE DOING SURGERY ON
[2:41:31] somebody
[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; that I'm GOING TO SIT HERE AND WAIT UPON
[2:41:35] YOU IF YOU DON'T TALK TO ME THIS WHOLE
[2:41:37] WEEKEND.
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; I come for you, Lord.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; I come for my brothers and sisters.
[2:41:51] &gt;&gt; I come to let you have your way.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; I come to be grace. So, if you'll give
[2:41:56] them grace then, why don't you give them
[2:41:57] grace now?
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; If somebody would come at the white
[2:42:00] throne judgment and you're a son and
[2:42:02] daughter of God, the bride, the saints
[2:42:04] will judge the earth. Somebody come and
[2:42:06] stand in front of you and you know them.
[2:42:08] There should be love and grace and say,
[2:42:10] "Lord, they were my neighbor. THEY WERE
[2:42:12] AT THAT FAMILY CAMP WITH ME.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry you missed THE RAP. I'M SORRY
[2:42:16] YOU MISSED IT. HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE
[2:42:17] THAT, BROTHER?" BUT LORD, LORD, COULD
[2:42:20] YOU GIVE THEM GRACE?
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; I'm stretching out there FOR YOU TODAY.
[2:42:24] BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET. WE'RE NOT AT
[2:42:26] THE WHITE THRONE JUDGMENT. TODAY IS THE
[2:42:28] DAY TO RECEIVE YOUR GRACE. TODAY IS THE
[2:42:32] DAY FOR US TO PULL YOU ONTO THIS OTHER
[2:42:34] SIDE AND SAY, "WHY WOULD YOU WAIT? WHY
[2:42:36] WOULD YOU REJECT? WHY WOULD YOU LET YOUR
[2:42:38] HEART BECOME HARDENED
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE DECEITFULNESS OF SIN?"
[2:42:43] &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE DAY TO RISE UP INTO THAT
[2:42:45] STATURE OF A PERFECT MAN AND SAY, "BE IT
[2:42:47] unto me according to thy word."
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; God bless the technical team.
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; God bless all the cleaners.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; I shook hands with the head chef TODAY
[2:42:58] AND I BLESSED HIM. HE'S HE'S NOT A
[2:43:00] BELIEVER.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; He's from lineage is from India and in
[2:43:05] that area, but he's from New Zealand. I
[2:43:07] talked to him a little bit. I I spent
[2:43:08] minutes with him this morning. I could
[2:43:10] have been in my room. I was there just I
[2:43:13] I wanted to come and just see some of
[2:43:14] you. Went went on a run, exercised a
[2:43:18] little bit, came back, came down, got my
[2:43:19] wife a coffee. Okay, get her a coffee.
[2:43:21] Got a little porridge, talked to some
[2:43:23] people, shook hands, have a wonderful
[2:43:25] day. But if you notice, it's always
[2:43:27] positive. is never negative, always
[2:43:30] good, THINKING OF YOUR GOOD. THAT'S OUR
[2:43:32] HEAVENLY FATHER.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; I PRAY THE HOLY SPIRIT BAPTIZE THIS CAMP
[2:43:36] WITH SO MUCH OF HIS PERFECT LOVE. IT
[2:43:38] WOULD JUST BE milky in here. JUST
[2:43:40] BROTHERLY KINDNESS, SISTERLY kindness
[2:43:43] [applause]
[2:43:45] to where even our little children, WE
[2:43:46] CAME OUT OF THE PRAYER TIME THIS
[2:43:48] MORNING. THERE WAS ONE OF YOUR LITTLE
[2:43:50] BOYS DOWN on his knees and there was a
[2:43:51] great big bug, great big bug crawling. I
[2:43:54] said, "Man, YOU GOING TO EAT THAT
[2:43:55] THING?"
[2:43:57] I was connecting with him.
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; One of the young men was riding his
[2:44:05] scooter around and said, "I better not
[2:44:07] ride on that scooter. I'd probably break
[2:44:08] it. I weigh too much.
[2:44:19] God, give us Christlike character.
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; The trials that we're going through can
[2:44:24] either make us
[2:44:31] in a certain way. We get all twisted up
[2:44:33] and carry it or we can just say, "Lord,
[2:44:38] may the character of Christ flow through
[2:44:40] me."
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; We all have trials. I'm quoting your
[2:44:44] prophet in the church age book. We all
[2:44:46] have trials. We're all tried and
[2:44:48] chasened. No one but goes through that.
[2:44:51] The church that's not suffering is not
[2:44:54] being tried and hasn't got it. It isn't
[2:44:56] of God. My precious New Zealand brothers
[2:45:00] and sisters, may God give you a new
[2:45:03] heart,
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; a new spirit, and give you his spirit.
[2:45:06] I'm not saying you don't have it. I'm
[2:45:08] just saying I want more of it.
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; If you'd asked BROTHER JOHN TODAY,
[2:45:11] "WHAT'S my greatest desire?" It would be
[2:45:13] more of Jesus.
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; Say, "You're just too simple." Well,
[2:45:17] then back to simplicity again.
[2:45:23] Heavenly Father,
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; I pray the Holy Spirit would just come
[2:45:26] at the close of this meeting.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; I think it was forecasted to be rainy
[2:45:32] this morning and the sun was shining.
[2:45:34] Lord, I pray the Holy Ghost sun would
[2:45:37] shine upon these people. As we pray and
[2:45:40] as we go into our lunchtime and begin to
[2:45:42] fellowship, this is our only Sunday
[2:45:44] afternoon that we're going to have a
[2:45:46] Shikina Tabernacles family camp.
[2:45:52] Heavenly Father, we want this nature of
[2:45:54] Christ above all things.
[2:45:58] The world has nothing for us.
[2:46:01] I'm asking for forgiveness of myself
[2:46:04] publicly if I have offended or hurt any
[2:46:08] of your sheep or your people.
[2:46:10] I was walking down the road today and I
[2:46:13] had to examine my own life. No civil
[2:46:17] war.
[2:46:18] We have to look inward and say, "H have
[2:46:20] I been guilty of this or of that?" We
[2:46:24] have to be able to take the looking
[2:46:26] glass and say, 'Lord, let your word be
[2:46:28] first partaking in my life. How could I
[2:46:32] ever say that to the people if if war is
[2:46:36] going on inside of me?
[2:46:39] Lord, let us be men and women and just
[2:46:41] let things go. Let us not bear grudges
[2:46:44] and have to get back at someone. And
[2:46:50] if what brother John said is true, and
[2:46:52] it is, that God's people are not
[2:46:54] warlike, that they're people of peace,
[2:46:58] if we've lent that, leaned that way in
[2:47:00] our lives and
[2:47:03] and and even influenced other people in
[2:47:05] our family or in our churches, forgive
[2:47:08] us, Lord.
[2:47:11] If there's one person that we've ever
[2:47:13] caused to take a stutter step after
[2:47:17] hearing something we've said or looking
[2:47:19] at one of our texts or our emails
[2:47:23] or just a side remark,
[2:47:27] it wasn't really a compliment to what
[2:47:28] you were doing in the meetings. It
[2:47:30] wasn't really in line with what the
[2:47:32] spirit would say to the church. Then
[2:47:35] would you forgive us? Kind heavenly
[2:47:37] father, would you put it under the blood
[2:47:40] and let the bleach take care of the
[2:47:42] chemicals? If it's a wrong spirit, if
[2:47:45] it's a wrong complex, if we are
[2:47:47] harboring,
[2:47:48] if we are harboring
[2:47:51] spirits and nurturing things that are
[2:47:54] not of you, forgive us.
[2:47:57] Forgive us of our sins and forgive us
[2:48:01] our debts as we forgive those that
[2:48:03] trespass against us. and lead us not
[2:48:06] into temptation, but deliver us from
[2:48:09] evil. For thine is the kingdom and the
[2:48:12] power and the glory forever.
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[2:48:17] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:48:19] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet today. God bless
[2:48:21] you. Let's give praise to God in
[2:48:23] worship. Hallelujah. [cheering]
[2:48:26] [applause]
[2:48:26] HALLELUJAH.
[2:48:32] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Y'all did so
[2:48:34] good earlier. Why don't you shake hands
[2:48:36] with somebody and hug their neck as our
[2:48:38] musicians come and
[2:48:41] if you're able to do that. Amen. Shake
[2:48:43] hands and God bless you, brother. God
[2:48:46] bless you, sister. God bless you.
[2:48:48] Appreciate you, too. Thank you very
[2:48:49] much. Hallelujah.
[2:49:23] Yeah. Hallelujah. I'm sparing you from
[2:49:26] doing it before your your lunch. Amen.
[2:49:28] So, shake hands with somebody.
[2:49:32] Hallelujah. We're going to sing this
[2:49:34] song. Feel my way. Is that the song or
[2:49:36] we change it?
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:49:41] Okay. She wrote the same song down.
[2:49:43] Isn't that incredible? Brother Isaac
[2:49:46] wanted, "Let's sing this certain song."
[2:49:47] And it's a certain way. And I said,
[2:49:49] "Okay, let's sing that." Our sister over
[2:49:52] there said she had written it already in
[2:49:54] a text. Let's sing this song. There it
[2:49:55] is. Same song.
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; What's that?
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Not to me, but she didn't text me.
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; Was she texting during church?
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:50:04] just delete that from the tape. What's
[2:50:07] that?
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; It's a text to herself.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, she texted herself. Okay. Wow.
[2:50:11] Speaking to yourself in psalms and
[2:50:13] hymns. Okay. I got a verse for that.
[2:50:15] Amen. Hallelujah. Okay. Let's sing this
[2:50:17] and then we're going to go and have a
[2:50:19] wonderful afternoon.
[2:50:20] &gt;&gt; Let me walk blessed Lord in the way that
[2:50:24] has gone. Leading straight to the land
[2:50:28] above.
[2:50:31] &gt;&gt; Giving cheer everywhere to the sad and
[2:50:35] the lone. Fill my way every day with
[2:50:39] love.
[2:50:41] Fill my way every day with love.
[2:50:46] As I walk through the hill,
[2:50:52] let me go for a while with a song and a
[2:50:56] smile. Fill my way every day [music]
[2:51:00] with love.
[2:51:02] Keep me close to the side [music] of my
[2:51:05] savior and guide. Let me never end on
[2:51:09] darkness. [music]
[2:51:13] My heart right there in my soul. Satisfy
[2:51:18] my
[2:51:21] [music]
[2:51:26] love.
[2:51:29] As I walk, [music and singing]
[2:51:34] let me go all the while with a song
[2:51:38] [music and singing] and smile.
[2:51:45] The race will be over [music]
[2:51:47] and I'll
[2:51:51] in my home [music]
[2:52:01] my [music]
[2:52:06] away every day with
[2:52:13] my [music]
[2:52:17] go
[2:52:19] with a song and a [music] smile. Feel my
[2:52:22] way [singing] every day with love.
[2:52:27] I'll build my way [singing] every day
[2:52:30] with [music] love.
[2:52:32] As I walk through the heavenly love,
[2:52:36] [music]
[2:52:38] let me know all the while with a song
[2:52:41] [music]
[2:52:42] and a smile. Fill my way every day with
[2:52:46] love.
[2:52:49] Hallelujah.
[2:52:51] We are a people of peace.
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; No more civil war.
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; No more bad attitudes towards one
[2:53:01] another. It ain't worth it.
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; It ain't worth it holding any grudge,
[2:53:05] resentment, hatred. You're not built to
[2:53:07] carry those things. You're built to
[2:53:09] carry joy, peace, love, gentleness,
[2:53:13] meekness, temperance. That's what you're
[2:53:15] built to carry.
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; Let's let's just let the past be the
[2:53:19] past. Let's move on in the Lord.
[2:53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who wants that honey in the box?
[2:53:25] Who wants that brotherly kindness?
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where you just, you know, it's
[2:53:28] supernatural [music] where you see
[2:53:29] anyone, you just have a love for them.
[2:53:31] Amen. That's what we're built to have.
[2:53:33] That's what we're built to possess.
[2:53:34] That's what the message came to give us.
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so thankful for that. Aren't
[2:53:38] you? God built you to be like that.
[2:53:42] Amen. I'm so glad. You know, I I think
[2:53:45] when I hear that was a master. Thank
[2:53:47] you, brother John. Thank you so much.
[2:53:49] Thank you. [applause]
[2:53:51] Amen. Appreciate it. Appreciate it.
[2:53:56] We need to hear We need to hear messages
[2:53:58] like this. We can't we can't be built to
[2:54:02] keep fighting someone else's war.
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; And we're called to break the cycle.
[2:54:07] &gt;&gt; To break the cycle.
[2:54:09] &gt;&gt; So it's not just peace, then war, then
[2:54:11] peace, then war, then peace, then war.
[2:54:12] It's just the war's gone. It's ended.
[2:54:15] Now it's peace.
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're built to break that cycle.
[2:54:19] &gt;&gt; So why not? Let's walk in peace. You
[2:54:22] know, there's a scripture. Yeah. We we
[2:54:24] talk about it. I was just thinking about
[2:54:25] so much during the service how [music]
[2:54:27] David would write in the Psalms,
[2:54:28] "Blessed are the brethren that dwell in
[2:54:30] unity." It's like the anointing oil that
[2:54:32] runs off Aaron's bed. Without that
[2:54:35] anointing oil, Aaron could not have gone
[2:54:37] into the Holy of Holies with the blood.
[2:54:40] He could never fulfill his office
[2:54:42] without that anointing oil. I tell you
[2:54:44] what, friends, we cannot fulfill our
[2:54:46] office as the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:54:48] without unity.
[2:54:52] &gt;&gt; So, let's just let the war go.
[2:54:54] You said, "This is all I've known." Say,
[2:54:56] "Lord, change my thinking. Change my
[2:54:58] speech as we heard this morning. Change
[2:55:00] my outlook towards one another."
[2:55:04] We all want to see each other on the
[2:55:05] other side. [music]
[2:55:08] &gt;&gt; So, let's live like it as we heard this
[2:55:09] morning. I'm not saying, you know, let's
[2:55:11] just encourage one another. Let's not
[2:55:12] let's not any negative thing come out of
[2:55:15] these lips, dwell in these hearts. May
[2:55:17] it all be positive towards one another.
[2:55:20] We're all the family of God.
[2:55:23] Thank God we live in a season of peace.
[2:55:25] And thank God I believe God has
[2:55:27] determined like it was a warning. We
[2:55:29] heard a warning.
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; Don't go back into it. Don't go back
[2:55:32] into those old ways of fighting. Let's
[2:55:34] keep walking in peace.
[2:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. May this country, the believers
[2:55:39] around this country be known as a
[2:55:41] peaceful people where there's such a
[2:55:43] unity. There's not church boundaries and
[2:55:46] territories and those kind. just we're
[2:55:48] all one family where it's just a family
[2:55:50] reunion where we see one another and we
[2:55:53] and we appreciate Christ and one another
[2:55:55] and we appreciate how we're built
[2:55:57] differently.
[2:55:58] Amen. So let's pray. [music] I I just
[2:56:01] want to say thank you Lord for this
[2:56:02] morning. Thank you Lord for speaking to
[2:56:05] me. Thank you Lord for sending a a
[2:56:07] warning. We don't need to go there.
[2:56:10] Let's move on. Like the apostle uh Paul
[2:56:13] would say, forgetting the things which
[2:56:14] are in the past. Let's leave it in the
[2:56:17] past. Let's walk on in divine love.
[2:56:21] Amen. [music] So, let's bow our heads
[2:56:22] this morning. Gracious father.
[2:56:25] Oh, hallelujah, Lord.
[2:56:28] Lord, we want divine love, but Lord, we
[2:56:31] need brotherly kindness for it to rest
[2:56:33] on.
[2:56:35] Oh, God. May we have that may just be
[2:56:38] flowing out of our lives. brotherly
[2:56:40] kindness, a real care and concern, and a
[2:56:43] real a real hunger, Lord, to see one
[2:56:46] another do better and walk with you and
[2:56:48] love you more. And just may we have that
[2:56:50] heart for one another, dear God.
[2:56:52] Because, Lord Jesus, as we heard this
[2:56:54] morning, we don't just want to talk
[2:56:55] about divine love. We don't just want to
[2:56:57] talk about brotherly kindness and these
[2:56:59] things. We want to see it live. What's
[2:57:01] the good of talking about it if it don't
[2:57:03] live, Lord? We want to see that manifest
[2:57:05] in our lives like never before. So,
[2:57:07] Father, I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:57:09] Christ, may you take your word which we
[2:57:10] heard this morning, may you anchor it
[2:57:12] into our hearts, Lord. May it bring
[2:57:14] forth a hundfold. Dear God, if we've
[2:57:16] been fighters, if we've just been had an
[2:57:18] attitude against one another, against
[2:57:20] another church, or Lord, may that be
[2:57:22] done. We don't want to cause collateral
[2:57:24] damage. Lord, we don't want any damage.
[2:57:25] Oh God, we want to call a stop to these
[2:57:28] things now in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:57:30] I pray, Father, that this this day would
