TRANSCRIPT
========================================
these things we see they're all gonna pass away now sometimes people get so worked up and everything is so important it must all be done and it's all just has to happen it always surprises me you have

name we thank you amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord God bless you amen praise the Lord friends good see everyone have you here brother Steven god bless you amen let's just go to Hebrews chapter 11 and we're going to go to Ezekiel chapter 28 hebrews chapter 11 now this just read verses 33 down to verse 38 Hebrews 11 33 to 38 who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong I want you to remember that phrase out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens woman received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings j moreover in bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder with tempted were slain with the sword wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in sorry Ana Mountains and dens and caves of the earth let's just keep going of these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect a minutes go to Ezekiel chapter 28 if I have it here now we just read through weakness was made strong we're gonna read about of being that it's very different Ezekiel 28 and we're gonna read from verse 14 just to just to you guys go read the whole chapter but we're just gonna read here from let's go read from verse 13 there's been an Eden the garden of God the speaking of Lucifer every precious stone was thy covering so zekiel 28 verse 13 the saddest Topaz the die the barrel the ox and the Jasper and the SS for sapphire and emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy temperance and my pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and I've set thee so there was upon the holy mountain of God thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire there was perfect in thy ways from the days that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of by merchandise they have filled the mitts of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore I'll cast thee as profaned out of the mountain of God I will destroy the Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of our beauty thou has corrupted thy thou has corrupted thy wisdom by reason of their brightness I will cast thee to the ground I will lay thee before Kings that they may behold thee thou has defile defiled the sanctuaries by the multitude of our iniquities by the iniquity of by traffic therefore will I bring forth a fire from the mitts of the each other via shall devour thee and I'll bring me to ashes upon the earth and the sight of all them to behold thee all they that know the among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and shalt never and never shalt thou be anymore amen may the Lord blesses word you may have your seats tonight now we read two very conflicted to very difficult conflicting is not the right word but two different kind of scriptures we read there and in Hebrews chapter 11 where Paul is writing the account of of the heroes of faith and we understand that should the Bible continue being written down into our day that your name would have been in there too because the same they had to overcome as the same faith you have received amen and so but you see he said out of weakness was made strong and they were they were yo destitute are in caves and death and no wonder and sheep skins tormented afflicted you know be said of the open the world is not worthy so these we're incredible people but then if we would have met them they would have been just like us they were as the Bible would say that Elijah was a man of like passion so they were not a different kind of people like us but they were exactly like us you know you know if we saw Elijah we would have seen a guy with it you know he would have knew he's a man wilderness there was nothing much of him to really look about they'd say this is an amazing prophet you know he had a big beard a yo pie thank you much you know he looked like an ordinary kind of guy but yet he was a prophet of God and God would come and anoint his life and God would what would reveal himself mightily in Israel you know through his through his ministry and and he would take a chariot ride one day hallelujah so something very special about him you know in that regard but humanly he was a person like us he got angry at a bunch of children and used this gift maybe I'm mixing Elijah and Elijah but you know he used his gift and he cursed those those children and 42 children were killed by some sheep is yeah because he cursed them and you know Elijah would call down fire out of heaven and devour you know you're a captain it is 50 with fire and then another 15 yo you know with fire and so you know he was a man and I'm saying these things because we look at ourselves and here we are in these bodies and we know our human weaknesses and we know our personalities and we know our quirks and we know you know just our little things that we don't like about ourselves God but yet God when he looks at you he doesn't look at your human frailty he doesn't look at your weakness he doesn't look at the things that you can't stand yourself he sees deity in people he sees his children hallelujah and it you think about it you know as the Bible would say in first Corinthians chapter chapter 6 and verse 19 Paul is telling the church what know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for year but with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods so he was telling these people and they were fighting they had been got carnal with what ministry they preferred one is of Paul one's of Cephas ones of Christ they begin to know and their carnality they would rally around humanly what they thought was the best ministry they fussed and fought and they were all out of water and but yet Paul would tell them but do you not know ye are the Temple of the Living God ye are the dwelling place of the Most High the very creator of heavens and earth dwells in you I mean but if we went and saw them in that day they would look like any other Greek people or whatever nationality they would like anyone else on the street you know they would have worn the same kind of robes that the other people would have worn maybe some people dressed more modestly than him I don't know your the robe would have looked all the same but what I'm trying to say is they would have looked you probably couldn't have picked them out in the crowd you following me they would have looked all the same to the rest of the Greek people amen but they had God in them it was a very different kind of thing they meant they was a dwelling place of the Living God and it's the same thing with the believer today you know Satan does not understand you say thinker's nada cannot understand how God could have such mercy and such grace upon a fallen decrepit human beings like we are hallelujah he does not understand it because when he was made he was made perfect amen he was his iniquity and nick word is found in his heart because of his beauty and because of his life as we just read there in ezekiel he was made perfect but yet God does not could not dwell in someone like that I mean God cannot dwell in something like that God comes down and and fallen humanity and takes and takes the dust of the earth as it were as we are amen and would dwell in those people and God would dwell in that and he can't you know which is a contrast to what Lucifer thinks he should dwell in a meant a Lucifer ism Beauty he's and he's and great things you go look at thee you know whose feed the st. Peters there and there in the Vatican has anyone been there it's a beautiful place I imagine incredible you can't put a value to it you know you couldn't insure that thing good luck trying to insure it you can't do it it's priceless because that's what Satan thinks is beauty that's what Satan thinks today you know that a church should look like a mint but yet God God doesn't dwell on that kind of a place God isn't interested in that kind of worship I mean God is looking for people that have been blood washed I'm in that a redeemed I mean they can worship Him not out of not out of some skill of singing or music only I mean but out of her but out of a redeemed heart where they have a revelation god you're my Redeemer god you're my king god you're my bridegroom god you're my all and all you're my shepherd I mean you're my blood you're my offering in my priest hallelujah he's looking for people about of out of that kind of heart oh now the people down through the Bible you take Moses Moses was had an incredible life you know you read the life of Moses and you see the incredible things that God that I'm basically just gonna repeat myself down through this this is where I'm going with this sermon this is the outline we take the fallen humanity of the believer show incredible things that God did in their life but yet show their their their their their their failings because we put them on a pedestal and in a way we should because God manifested in their lives but yet we we somehow can think in our lives I can never be like those people how can I be with me tonight is this all right it means you take Moses and you think what an incredible thing would be to be a to be to be a one-man invasion down into the greatest greatest nation there at the time which was Egypt the world power and he and he goes and he says let my people go and he demands that that Pharaoh give up the people of God and the thing is he invaded and he was successful I mean he didn't take any damage he didn't you know he just went in and demanded it then he said Pharisee I'll not let them go says well I'm gonna plague your kingdom and I'm gonna plague your kingdom and darkness is going to come on your kingdom in death is going to come on you kingdom and then you have to let them go amen that's exactly what happened then they come down to the Red Sea God guided them down there to their place of the Red Sea and then and then and then Moses would say say were say these words of thee you see these Egyptians today you'll see them no more forever he said it but then he but then he begins to ask God what am I going to do have you even been down that place amen I'm gonna take a rapture all my family is coming we're gonna walk out of here victorious then Lord what's going to happen help me hello amen and then God says speak why Christ speak move forward and speak I mean so he lifted up a staff at a Red Sea parted they crossed over us on dry ground all of Israel was over a young old cattle whatever they took with them overthrew and then they turned around the Egyptians tried to follow them Moses raised up a staff whatever he do and they and the seaweeds back where it was and all their enemy was destroyed hallelujah that's incredible were you thinking about Majan imagine being near that day there'd be amazing thing to see and so here he was anointed and brother Branham says I don't just have the place but when you're Moses he would stand there say thus saith the Lord he began to speak it wasn't him speaking but then the inspiration left him and he was Moses again amen and then God would have to began thus saith the Lord such and such and such and then the inspiration left him and then he was Moses again and here we are but he say well I'm not a prophet God God commissioned him for a job I've heard the cries of my people I have come down he says I've heard the cries of my people that I'm sending you and it was God coming down and into his prophet to go deliver his people and then Moses will begin to make excuses I can't speak you know I can't do this job and here we are here we are we've been commissioned to do a job have we know not to be a prophet like Moses but we're commissioned to be the Bride of Christ I mean to administer mercy I mean pardoning grace to this world hey men everything Jesus died for we are to administer to this world because God uses his body you say well that's just a bit far-fetched no it's not far-fetched yeah on the day of Pentecost God came and dwelt in his body he he redeemed the euro He shed his blood upon the earth of Calvary for the sins of the world and then he came and dwelt in his body and the upper room he gets to speak the words of life through his body amen so the so what was purchased that down Calvary was now administered through the body angel goes through Cornelius go to Joppa you'll find Simon Peter in a certain house come get him and he'll tell you the woods of eternal life I mean so they go get Simon Peter it comes to a Cornelius house they have a meeting and while you Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell upon me why didn't the angel just give them me you know the Holy Ghost he couldn't because God uses his body amen so now here's Moses and then incredible things happen but yet after car after the inspiration leaves him he's just Moses again and if you looked at Moses he's thinking about he comes an 80 year old man he's a shepherd on the backside of the desert and here he comes into customs I'll bring it young what are you here for what's the purpose of visit invasion other he writes invasion okay you can go through some reason and let him through if you looked at them it'd just be an 80 year old man what's so special about this man what's so special about you what are you looking at when you look in the mirror what are you looking at when you look at yourself and in your mind you tele up this is my good my strengths and my weaknesses what are you looking at and yet he lived a life you look at Moses he lived such a life he could change the mind of God God says I'm gonna wipe out Israel I'll start with you throws himself on the and the breech-block my name out don't block their name out amen think about it this is the kind of life a powerful life a man powerful life even even when even when he was angry you know he didn't do what God told him did speak to the rock Oh bring forth water has already been split knee got angry he bunch of rebels do I have to bring forth water and glorified himself but yet the water came forth amen incredible life you think about it but he was just an ordinary man yes Caleb Caleb was a slave he was a slave he's 84 years old he's standing before Joshua he's followed this ministry for maybe 44 odd years I don't know how long it was 40 years in the wilderness I don't know how he was old he was when he came out of Egypt but he's been following this this message he's 84 years old he doesn't look - he doesn't look all that so great about him you know if we look if we saw him he just been ordinary I'm gonna repeat this if you know why you're opinio I want to emphasize this because we look at ourselves we don't see too much you got to look again you know because if you look at yourself the devil will inspire you you think you you're it do you think you're redeemed you think you're gonna you think you're an overcomer you think you're gonna sit on his throne as he sat down on his Father's throne you think you're going to take a rapture you think you're really in the promised land possessing your land you really think that and if and if you allow your mind to go down that kind of way you just look at your failings and you'll devalue yourself because the devil wants you to think very less about yourself he doesn't want you to think about you how God thinks about you remember the Bible says there'll be a day that we will know as we are knowing right that we you shall know as you are known that says in Corinthians so there has to come a day where you know as God knows you that's what that scripture says and this is the day where we know as we are knowing so what God sees about us we know what he says we know what he thinks about us are you with me I mean so that's why you don't look at your humanity cuz you'll begin to yo you'll begin to belittle yourself and it will go from one minute I'm going to take a rapture just now - maybe I'm in the wilderness then rdf:li back in Egypt and all god help me I'm a sinner I'm lost how we doing everyone why what's happened because you've been devalued in your own mind but that's not what God thinks about you God says you're bone of my bone your flesh of my flesh your life of my life your spirit of my spirit your power my power she has hidden the prophecies I'm in the brightest him because husband or wife become one hallelujah and he put you above his own life amen he put you at the greater value than his own blood and he didn't hesitate he wink for this cause I've come hallelujah Heaton had to be dragged up Calvary he went up Calvary he says nobody to take my life from me I lay it down and if I let down oh I'll take it back up again he with me hallelujah he knew the reason NS is the joy the joy that was set before him hello who's what's that joy you're the joy here's my redeemed ones it's gonna be glorious day that day up there here come the redeemed ones we say here we are Lord we've been redeemed hallelujah here comes my precious ones hallelujah he comes my victorious ones oh yeah there's not pie in the sky you have to place yourself you say well what does God think of me how's your day I had a terrible day but what does God think of me has he weekly and I've had a terrible week but what does God think of me I just keep going with the time frame but what does God think of me we just let's take a trip to the plains of memory is a is a is a couple there they'd be mad for a very long time they just had their names changed once will they ever have once called Sara if we went there we'd see basically what we'd call these days as nomads a bunch of tents up on the yeah you know on the plains cattle servants it was actually quite a big place because the armed is service is about 300 odd servants they armed - go - go get lot and this family back is quite a big settlement and we would walk then and we think this really and then maybe we would go over to another cross the river to another plane and would find another seal quite similar they may be with juni another place would find people who look pretty similar to them as well so what made them special cuz humanely Abraham and Sarah they just looked like without turn young again you see but humanly they didn't look all that different but here was he was the father of the faith he was the father of the faith amen out of him hallelujah the promised one's gonna come now Isaac wasn't the promise were after the flesh he was but the real Promised One was Christ amen and so if we looked at him we'd say there's nothing special about about you but Abraham could stand up saying I'll tell you something God has said I'm his friend hallelujah he's changed my name hey man he's changed my wife's name as well holy he called me out of Babylon he called me out of there he's brought me to this land he says I'm gonna possess this land and humanly you'd say you're crazy Alleluia but he wasn't crazy right hello you look at you we're we're quite ordinary looking people Amen we're very ordinary looking people we don't we don't fly around on private jets we don't have big mansions we don't own islands and and wanting to travel in this you know build spacecraft and travel into space and you know we don't do we don't do those kind of things we look like just anyone yeah but yet brother Bram said the difference Abraham was no just an ordinary man but Thurman says God called him and that makes a difference and he got a F yo if he called the father of the faith you call the children I mean some trustees called you hallelujah leave this place leave this country doesn't come back geographical location leave this place leave this sin leave this darkness and I'll take you to a land I'll take you to an inheritance hallelujah place you in a land a place in an inheritance hallelujah glory to God amen and he left and there he was and then this three men walking he's sitting there on the plains of memory waiting for the promise to come we're waiting for a promise to come amen it's gonna happen assurance those three men came walking to him that night olia why am i smiling cuz I know it's gonna happen early amen and he was then he saw three men walking they look like ordinary men they didn't they weren't great big Joe angelic kind of white ropes and something extra they would just they just look like you and I because God put on flesh but one was God and Abraham knew it was God for the sick because he had seen him before he saw him as Melchizedek he saw him your he seen him before that's why he didn't say he didn't say the three of them was God he said one of them was hallelujah amen they look like ordinary men but here comes the promise walking down the promise came she is according to time of life time of life speaks of a woman not a man according to time of life you're going to have the promised son hallelujah and you know there is a story see her lost within herself and you know her has discerned and you know and it's just a few chapters later she's holding a baby hallelujah they just look like ordinary men now King David it says that here's a little ruddy fellow when he when he came up against Goliath he was just an ordinary man he was just like you and I but the difference was he'd been anointed by vindicated prophet he was anointed by the prophet of the age hallelujah and all the Horn of anointing all was poured out upon him not just a measure by the fullness hallelujah and we have come to the same David his own father didn't consider himself then consider David to be the future king of Israel he wasn't even invited when the Prophet came to his house do you have another son says Samuel and Jesse says oh yeah I do he's out there in the field why wasn't he there because Jesse didn't think he would be king and here's the king God tells Samuel and Jesse's house I have a king for my people and Jesse humanly didn't even consider maybe or maybe it's David of course it was David oh yeah the ones who look like they'd be king God sit no no no no was the eighth son I don't know I I'm not sure where is where's David Isis he's out there looking out the Sheep they bring him in God says this is the one and maybe I don't know what his brothers would have thought hmm they see Samuel take out the Horde of anointing oil pour it over his head I see the Spirit of God was with him from that day on he looked like an ordinary mint imagine going when when when David this is a few years later David's on the run David's on the run from from Saul he fled into the wilderness and it says all that were discontented and debt and you're all those things they gathered themselves to David imagine going to that camp you go to a cave somewhere I don't know where they hid there some kind of catch and he see this guy come out and they wouldn't have been dressed up they didn't look like Saul and his men in the palace that's for sure it had been rugged looking carrying their stuff on their backs whatever you know maybe a beard out like this I don't know what they wouldn't have looked all that fancy but there was something there was something about David that caused people together and people gather to David because they believed he was coming into power they knew he was coming into power they knew that that anointing that was poured out upon him by the Prophet I mean that he was going to be king would become manifest one day that he was going to sit upon the throne with a crown on his head amen and that's the same thing you know you just look I was I was standing out the back there thinking about this I singing this is just a building you just take any Church any any believers church ultimately it's just a building it doesn't even compare to the great churches of the world even you take the finest message church you could find doesn't even pale in comparison to to half the things I'm just like this used to be an adult disability Center there's really nothing pretty about this place at all at all amen but yet God and we've just put some chairs out you know we've just whatever and God meets us here and that's like any church anywhere it was a building they would have inspired to builder to renovate it whatever more it doesn't look that amazing to the to the outside world but yet the the true and living God dips into that place and he takes people of fallible flesh hallelujah redeems them makes them in as image gathers them holy respect heaven comes down when God's people gather hallelujah so they saw David these men said we believe is coming into power hallelujah they didn't look anything special either but yet an anointing came upon them I mean that the great warriors of the world wish they had just a little teaspoon off well they one of them killed hundreds of men few of them did it amen David just had a desire wish I could drink from the wells of Bethlehem and they until them or threes I think three of them said let's go get him a drink oh yeah and they cut their waist down through the Philistine garrison it was not a choreographed Hollywood battle amen then looked really cool they just slugged it through they slugged it back whatever they had to do there was a bunch of dead bodies anyone who got any way was killed because they wanted to meet the desire of their King hallelujah and here we are friends here we are the devil wants to hold us back from real spiritual worship he wants to hold us back from a real spiritual walk with God cut through every enemy I mean you have a weapon you have a sword and never gets blood hello a man is trying to make a life that will never go blunt we have won hallelujah and never goes blood and always finds the killing place hallelujah so cut through brother Brandon says oh you Bethlehem Amen are you you ones that have gathered yourself Sir David you know he's coming into power cut yourself through every Philistine garrison a bit of unbelieving formalism all these things and fresh pentecostal drink Alleluia and David comes to power and these mighty men to get them he makes them hit over Cities Alleluia amen here comes you think of we could just go through all the believers he comes take him Solomon and reality he wouldn't look like sure he his head as wealth and all these things but humanly he just would look like anyone else but he's inspired he takes the instructions of his father build the temple and he stirred up he builds the temple this didn't happen the second time they built the temple amen builds the temple you look at the temple in reality it wasn't from the outside the temple is not some big grand thing that we humanly would think it should be have you ever looked at just what people think the temple looked like go on google and google the temple and go images aim has anyone done that this is the interactive part of the service yes we normally always have one these days just see as if one here it doesn't look that great it's far bigger temples that that other religions have had built but yet there's something very different about this temple hallelujah and God use fallible man God used men with failings you take the body of Christ you take the body the redeemed body from Genesis down to now there's failings there's this there's complexes there's there's brokenness there's hurt there's pain there's differences in opinion is different personalities all different kinds of things but yet they are manifesting God for their age hallelujah so he builds the temple God comes and fills the temple Alleluia I'm glad that's the case now the Apostle Paul I'm just going to how we doing for time I hope you're not bored now the Apostle Paul that wrote out of weakness they were made strong now I want to I want to say these things I think I've already seen it but Satan does not understand how God could have such mercy and grace upon people like us he does not understand how God could could redeem a people that God could make them like Adam was before the fall god does not understand how he could give his creative power to a people who had been born and soon shaken iniquity come to a world speaking lives Amy what is the power of the third Pole the creation the power of the spoken word amen now we don't necessarily need Stahl spoken out of existence amen but there's lost loved ones around right there's all these different things we haven't we have different kind of needs right but God doesn't though Satan so he doesn't understand because memmer Satan the one thing he can't do is create he cannot create he can only provoke so he but he has a longing because you take anyone who has a thirst for power and satiable thirst for fame or power or popularity money whatever it may be that's satanic because they have such a they're driven by something I mean it all it does is elevate themselves when they get there you know he take the great big famous people of the world who becomes the idol they do write satanic and so now so he wants he wants the power of the spoken word he wants to be able to create but he cannot but yet God comes down you just take Moses under the blood of bulls and goats let flies come flies came let frogs come frogs come let locusts come locusts come turn the water into black waters turned into blood take it back again as taken back again yeah that the hail come the hail came let darkness darkness cover Egypt darkness covered Egypt hallelujah incredible it wasn't him that was God through a man speaking under the blood of book power under the blood of bulls and goats brother Bram says I think it's in the breach message he says now if a man can do that under the blood of bulls and goats how much more are people under the blood of Jesus Christ I mean that this isn't just covered but they've been done away with I mean but they're they don't have a fallen nature anymore they got a redeemed hallelujah you take Jesus Jesus you know you read the Gospels what what's he doing what's God doing he's demonstrating this as me as a man I'm gonna make you like this whatever measure it is that's up to God but this he's demonstrating himself now wind waves peace be still amen Lazarus come forth baby I mean ghost of the was it dry says daughter arise the one who is dead cast out devils had dominion over everything and the Bible tells us when we see him there's nothing of him that we should desire just a short little guy nothing nothing special about him he he dressed he was like what are the poor people I did here was the Redeemer yeah a man he was the Redeemer and so God was showing these things as a man because he's trying to tell you now this is what the first Adam did I'm the second Adam I'm going to show you what I do and then the works that I do shall you do also he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also and greater than the shall do because I go to my father amen and see here he was and he was demonstrating this is what this is what I can do and you take the Apostle Paul he was brother BAM City as a hook nose juice you know just he was he had a certain temperament about him Peter was as well and you can see Peters failings his Peters failings he denies the look he does all cut he curses while doing it you know he tells the disciples after the resurrection I'm just going to go fishing let's just go back let's just go fishing I don't know what else to do he had a lot of failures he had heaps of failing they're all documented like like David David did far worse of things and soldered but David was selected by God to be the king sol was man's choice David was God's choice hallelujah if you're God's choice tonight you should say glory to God I mean glory to God I'm God's voice hallelujah sure he he had to pay for the things he did but God didn't take the king kingship from him just because of the things he did just like God doesn't take bribed chip I'm a you following me God doesn't take your position as bride of Christ Amy just because you may do some things glory be to God I mean so Peter had his frustrations as ups and it's downs but yet God and and Jesus even even said to him when he when he lets just go to mark chapter 16 now Matthew I may have this wrong but we'll find it yes Matthew 16 then we understand we're not going to read it but Matthew 16 down from verse 13 jesus would ask we're just going to go to verse 21 down to verse 23 don't try to verse 23 yet this o Peter has the room Peter has the revelation thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and so Jesus is blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed the sunder unto you but my father in heaven and upon this rock I'll build my church wait sorry we need to go further up okay let's go from verse 18 of Matthew 16 and I said to thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven well that's amazing here he is okay incredible then Chad see the disciples they tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ now let's read down but 21 down to verse 23 notice what what Jesus oil just keep running from there time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then then Peter took him so here's the one saying who said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and who said you will have the keys of the kingdom then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from the Lord that thou shalt this shall not be unto thee so Jesus is telling him I'm gonna go to Jerusalem I'm gonna pay for the sins of the world that's basically what he's saying I'm gonna redeem you Peter I'm gonna my blood upon the earth for you I'm gonna loose you from the powers of Satan hey I am the Holy One of Israel I am the one that was promised in the garden that you know you're the seed of the woman Here I am he says you will not do this thing and then then he turned and said this is Jesus speaking to the one who is going to give the keys to Peter get thee behind me get thee behind me Satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of God but those that be of men well and we know who Peter denies the Lord three times you know who you know he does all these things but yet that doesn't change that did not change Peters position as spokesmen on the day of Pentecost and he opened the he used the keys to the key opens the door and he opened the door to the Jews the Gentiles and the Samaritans all the same way repent and be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the kingdom of God is within you which is the Holy Ghost and the believer yeah amen and then and then Peter even gets carried away in the book of Acts with with a false false doctrine coming into the church all you have to become a Jew before you can become a Christian he gets carried away with it and then Paul goes down there and straightens them out how are we think about it amen now does that mean he just got God to sit I'm sick of you Peter I've given you too many chances I'm taking those keys away from you amen yeah you're you're no longer an apostle of my no no amen and no doubt Peter Winnie if he could look and and maybe look over looks shoulder as he read I've wrote the book of Acts he wouldn't he probably wouldn't doubt can you just omit that but you can write about before the cross but don't write about my failures after the cross hello but God inspired Luke when he wrote the book of Acts put listen cuz it shows that a believer can gets can't get influenced a wrong way right but that doesn't make them not a believer but God because what is inequity now this is the difference I'm going back to where I was Satan I mean Luke yeah when here's the anointed cherub that covereth he was perfect in all his ways here's a here's something that's Annie if we saw him as he was like that you'd say what an incredible being we would be blown away by what he looked like amen it's okay to say you saw agree we'd be amazed if he were standing here for what he was back there you could say that's incredible we would be awed right but the thing is he had a nick so on one hand here's this one and then on the other side we read about those who are destitute tormented afflicted walked about in sheepskins and goatskins dwells in caves you know of whom the world is not worthy what is the difference between these two this one has no iniquity because the Nick what he is to know the truth and not do it this one who looks perfect has inequity in his heart but humanly would say that's incredible these guys are just a bunch of homeless people put us a base put into today's language but the ones who look like nothing are the jewels in his crown Jesus's crown then there are deemed ones hallelujah brother but the main thing is there was an inequity in their hearts there's iniquity in his heart so now when Paul went when Paul came to Creek Peter he saw the errors of his way and he was humble enough to Humble himself to the truth of God's wouldn't say I was wrong yeah amen and that's the great thing about a believer they can go down off some crazy rollercoaster ride of some funny thing but yet when the truth comes their way they will come back amen that doesn't mean that doesn't mean they're they are not believers amen you heard the testimony of Loni Jenkins and I'll probably tell this completely wrong but you go go see his testimony there are some people who came to Tucson and I don't know what year this was probably back in the seventies or whatever and they begin to they were they were representing some God thing from India and his vindication was a cloud would come over the top of the house and prove that and you know this would happen and brother Lonnie and some people from the church were getting caught up in these things and brother Lonnie was going to go have a look and God said don't go but he win anyway and he goes to this you know goes to this meeting in this house and some things begin to be seen he thought this is a little bit different but then they went out of the house and the man said now to prove on that you know I speak the truth look and then just above the roof there's this big giant cloud anything at all this is amazing and then that see lightning moving the broom and all different kinds of things but then he heard someone no no this part of might get wrong but he heard one of these people who'd heard accepted this new kind of doctrine was blasting the church they came out of about how they need to receive this as opposed to the message how this is greater than the message they by the licensing this is all kind of funny and in he's at his home praying about it and he sees like this fog begin to lift and this light coming and he could see it for what it was and God delivered him of that spirit and God told him I told you not to go I mean now did that mean brother Lonnie wasn't a believer to begin with no he wasn't believer to begin with is this alright you should go see his testimony he tells it himself right but because he was he was he was a genuine one when the truth came his way amen that brought him out of it yeah I don't know how I got on that subject but you know there's parts of our Christian walk that we're not proud of brother branham no doubt he wasn't proud of the fact that he turned down the invitation the first time amen there was a lot of things you know and and he would be honest you know he says I'm a nervous person I get all wound up like this you know this is how I am you know and no doubt he would have wished he was built different but God made him a certain way for a certain job you know and it's the same thing with us we have made a certain way our humanity is not really stop looking at your humanity I'm gonna kind of wine this up but I want you to see don't beat yourself up about who you are if only I was this other person if you're this other person God would have made you the other person I mean don't try to be something you're not amen we don't all water God has not brought I was a brother wrong Spencer says God isn't a cookie-cutter it others go check and make us all the same right we're all individual hallelujah and God made us brother Ram sister bride is like a great big bouquet amen these big flowers as little flowers nice the green stuff that's put in there you don't know why you know there's and there's all kind of them but God made the bride a bouquet and as long as you're in the body who cares yo like like like King David see I'd rather be what the doorman and whatever in the house of God than something else as long as I'm part of the house alleluiah and it doesn't matter you just think about this satan looks at you it's like Pharaoh and Moses looked at the children of Israel as slaves Pharaoh saw slaves Moses saw God's people Amen God looks at you and he sees this is my queen hallelujah this is my the one I love my eyes upon him amen I've been waiting for her and here she is she is the one I delight in you know you take you take Genesis and there's 25 years of Abraham you know from from he's first called out of or wherever he was going into the Promised Land you know receiving Isaac and so on however many years after that he's alive it's all recorded there's many things happening around the world but it's not in there because God as God is leading his son God has focused upon his son I know if I said this a few times but you know it's not this civilizations rising his inventions its new languages this writing being you know there's all different things being invented it's not written it's not written in there why isn't it written in there because it's not important to God he's not worried about that stuff he's Abraham I'm leading him lujah I'm revealing him I'm revealing myself to her making myself knowing Allah lujah and it's like the same thing with you and I when when things are all said and done all the other stuff you know this is not going to be remembered right all these different inventions or the world history brother broom I think even sees in one place there's no really point riding history anymore because we've come to the end who's gonna read it amen people get caught up in all these other things but in God yo well you know if it was written if our lives were written in here like Abraham's life and they led him here listen us all this other stuff around the world wouldn't be recorded it's not it's not going to be recorded that the Lions and the All Blacks drew the series that's not in the Bible the Bible the Americas caps not gonna wouldn't be written in there whatever things people love and they have great ambitions it's not gonna be it wouldn't be written down I'm not trying to make a joke but you think about people get so caught up with all the stuff oh that person one listen this person to listen this you know it's not there because God is focused on you what if some musicians gonna come I want to I think I need to stop but God God looks at you see these are my children I love them with everything within me I gave myself as a ransom amen and he takes you he takes you he lives in you and he uses you as a vessel to bring down Satan's Kingdom hallelujah look he took Moses he was a man he had a temper Moses had a temper he got angry amen he was you know here too you know your brother I said he had a high-tempered wife the poor you know we didn't stick him sighs one of his sons now had a bloody husband to me it's what the Bible says in the Bible would I can say it yeah right you know angry wife on the backside days that God used that to mold Moses as Moses and you look at that you say they're having trouble amen they had a lot of trouble there a lot of intense fellowship and it was God molding hallelujah it was God molding his vessel and then his vessel was ready he was 80 years old God because God didn't want him to be this great big Prince okay boy okay Israel here's the weapons we'll take the armory I'm a general I know how to fight I know I know the weaknesses the Egyptian army I've studied them because if you really if you really want to win a battle you need to study your weakness because the devil will study your weakness so if you know your weakness you can protect yourself amen but if you know your weakness you can just get blindsided well how did that happen workers he studied your weakness and when you take great sports teams of the world they don't just they study their opponent you look at boxers you know when they fight they study how the other boxer boxes and then they get sub then they get a sparring partner who boxes like the opponent I mean a brother BAM says we just study our opponent you study your opponent you should study him amen I can't think of what to do today study your opponent go through the Bible and see where the believers fell and failed because the devil use the same tactic against you amen go do it not just where they overcame but where they fail study your opponent because the devil will come along he's a creature of habit you know sorry you standing what's the first thing here in Genesis Satan anoints the serpent what does the serpent say to e-j has God said he just takes takes a scripture confuse just a little bit now if you read Genesis from there he was God known as God when he made all things but when he came to man it's the Lord God so instead of the self existing one that's the self existing one who reveals himself to his family right so he changed his expression because his family were there but then when the serpent came on the serpent tells Eve has God said so God is just the self existing one who doesn't make himself known to his children he's a distant god that's God really you think God really cares about you do you think he really worries about what you're going through in life does he really you really think he understands you that's what that's what the Serpent's a deef because the devil comes along he's not actually he's distant you're just a little thing God doesn't actually care about you he's not interested in you and then he said yeah God has said what happened she didn't say no the Lord God has said he followed me you go read it it's a reason why he's known as as the Lord or God or the lord god there's meanings behind though it's not just English woods put together for its these names expressions behind it so if Eve X I said no the Lord God has said we shall not eat of the tree that would have actually shown oh I'm actually in a relationship with this Lord God I know him he knows me he's my father and it would have protected it but the first lie that she accepted was God as a distant thing he doesn't care and the devil does the same thing today amen and that's where she fell right because first she accepted that God is a distant thing the earth doesn't reveal himself that's why you see easy people the devil comes against you God doesn't care about you God's not interested in you he's just some distant where is he he's up in the heaven someplace where is that you know he's just the god of history amen and then why is that then then now comes the sucker punch right and he does the same thing you got a study where they fail study with a believer fails how did he get Moses from from stop going into the Promised Land we know that Moses wasn't ordained because the law could never take the believer into the Promised Land it had to be grace right we know that but what did how did how did how did the devil get Moses got him angry look at the weakness of the people look at their rebellion look at their stiff you know hardened hearts and stiff necked and you know got him angry you bunch of rebels do I have to bring water for you he was angry the devil uses his anger against them yeah and then you did that thing the water came forth all the same I think God said come aside you're not going in amen yeah doesn't it doesn't mean we're out of here because we do one thing wrong but Moses paid for that you reap what you sow amen why did you know David why did he fall with Bathsheba the devil used us you know his weakness his weakness was for married woman what he wanted Abigail he married Abigail after after her husband died it's different once he's been Sheba she's married he's not fighting battles anymore he's just sitting back in his palace now I can rest everything's well I don't need to fight anymore the young people can do the praying they can do the they can rejoice I'm just gonna sit back I don't need to do anything oh now the older people could do it I'm just a little person who cares about you no I'm just a little face in the crowd hey either way just sits back I can sit back to my palace I don't need to fight anymore now had a weakness amen you can take it all the way down through the Bible look at where they fell where they failed amen where is that gonna go they'd sing a song go study your opponent studied the failures of the believers it didn't make them not believe us right but you have weaknesses and the devil studies you and he uses you against you because he knows you he studies you right because he wants you to fall because it's just like how he got he got Moab to to bring Israel to the feasts and they and they married one another and God killed however many thousands of them in the Book of Numbers why because God knew cause the devil knew if I can get the believers to transgress God's Word then God will judge them amen and that's why that's why the devil tries to eat you to cross God's Word then because you're his child God will deal with you amen I better stop let Signet some was it Martin Luther wrote that song amazing love how could it be yeah Amen I think yeah anywhere let's stand this second shall we maybe we'll pick it up on Sunday I don't know amen we are the Bride of Christ glory to God we read a hallelujah He shed his blood for you and I amen hallelujah wait we're in glory you'll still be you you will still be you I'll still be

skin the devil doesn't want you to be comfortable in your own skin why do people go through midlife crisis because the devil annoys them all how most of your life was gone a few you know what your wife wanted to do now just just go throw it all in and go do this you waste one of that sports car go buy it why cuz people aren't comfortable in their own skin they go through a change of life hey
