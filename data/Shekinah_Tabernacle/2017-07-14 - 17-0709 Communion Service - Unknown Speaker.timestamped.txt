[25:57] bless you everyone
[25:59] I mean what a reason to live
[26:01] Hallelujah
[26:03] I mean let's just go to
[26:06] Romans chapter 5.
[26:17] and then we're going to go to um
[26:22] we're gonna go to Peter
[26:26] uh First Peter chapter one so Romans 5
[26:33] and let's just read
[26:38] let's just read from verse 5.
[26:41] and Hope
[26:42] maketh not ashamed because the love of
[26:45] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[26:47] Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[26:49] for when we were yet without strength
[26:51] and Due Time Christ died for the ungodly
[26:53] for scarcely for for scarcely or a
[26:57] righteous man will one die yet
[26:58] pre-adventure a good man
[27:01] should uh some would even dare to die
[27:04] but God commanded commandeth his love
[27:07] towards us and that while we were yet
[27:09] sinners Christ died for us much more
[27:12] than being now justified by his blood we
[27:15] shall be saved from the Wrath through
[27:16] him for if when we were enemies we were
[27:19] reconciled to God by the death of his
[27:21] son much more being reconciled we are
[27:24] saved by his life not only so but we
[27:27] also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
[27:30] Christ by whom we have received the
[27:34] atonement
[27:35] amen and then
[27:37] Peter
[27:49] first Peter and chapter one verse 8.
[27:54] whom having not seen ye love in whom
[27:58] though now you see him not yet believing
[28:01] you rejoice with joy unspeakable and
[28:04] full of Glory
[28:05] receiving the end of your faith even the
[28:08] salvation
[28:09] of your souls amen may the Lord bless
[28:12] his word tonight you may have seats
[28:18] I want to um
[28:20] just take a a short time to speak about
[28:24] speak about our Lord before we go to uh
[28:28] have communion and the Lord's supper and
[28:30] no we understand it's an incredible
[28:32] thing where
[28:33] God would move upon a heart
[28:36] and to see because the whole Christian
[28:39] walk and journey
[28:41] personally in a family and in a church
[28:44] your body it's all it's governed by
[28:47] Divine love
[28:48] it is not governed by fear
[28:50] it is not governed by pressure
[28:53] it is governed true Christianity is
[28:56] governed by Divine love and we read
[28:58] there in Romans 5 and 5 because you know
[29:01] our hope maketh not you know we're not
[29:03] ashamed because of the whole because the
[29:04] love of God which is shared about our
[29:06] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[29:08] unto us and I was thinking this
[29:10] afternoon
[29:12] what an incredible thing where you you
[29:14] take the life of say the Apostle Paul or
[29:17] any of the any of the Believers where
[29:19] there came a time in their life where
[29:22] they did not know where they would end
[29:24] up
[29:24] on this natural natural walk the Apostle
[29:28] Paul I don't know necessarily if he knew
[29:30] he had to give his life you know if he
[29:32] knew he'd be in prison if he knew he'd
[29:34] be beheaded for the cause of Christ
[29:37] but yet there was something in them and
[29:40] I believe would be the same thing with
[29:42] us if we knew what we would have to face
[29:44] every day if we knew the tribulation
[29:46] we'd have to go through the Dark Places
[29:49] the hard times the struggles of life you
[29:52] know if if that was laid out before us I
[29:56] believe the believer would say yes Lord
[29:58] I will go through it because I love you
[30:01] I mean because of divine love we are
[30:04] constrained by Divine love
[30:06] amen that it wouldn't matter how bad
[30:08] things get how dark it can seem yet
[30:12] Divine love drives us through amen I
[30:15] don't say it pushes you through but it
[30:16] leads you through I should say Amen you
[30:19] take and maybe this is probably a bigger
[30:20] thing but you take Saul and you know
[30:23] King Saul and King David King Saul was
[30:27] man's choice
[30:28] he was you know he was Head and
[30:30] Shoulders Above the Rest he looked like
[30:33] a king but he was man's Choice he was
[30:35] not God's choice and because he was
[30:38] man's Choice he operated by fear even
[30:41] though he is Anointed by the same
[30:42] Prophet that David was anointed by the
[30:45] spirit of God was with him the same as
[30:46] David was but he was not God's choice
[30:50] and because he governed because he had
[30:52] the complexes in his life of being from
[30:54] the smallest family in the smallest
[30:56] tribe and all these insecurities he
[30:59] governed the church Israel was a church
[31:01] he gathered the church by fear and
[31:03] intimidation remember the first time he
[31:05] he called Israel to battle he took an ox
[31:08] and he divided it and he sent it to the
[31:10] four corners of the of you know of the
[31:12] country saying you'll be like this if
[31:14] you don't come and fight so he he was
[31:15] motivated the People by fear
[31:18] but when David when David was King when
[31:22] David was anointed king he led his
[31:25] people very differently the people I
[31:27] believe that gather themselves that
[31:29] David loved David
[31:31] they actually love them because as
[31:33] brother Brandon would would bring out in
[31:35] in um in various sermons about how how
[31:38] the smallest desire that David had
[31:41] became the greatest commandment to his
[31:43] mighty men how he longed for a drink
[31:46] from The Well of Bethlehem and he just
[31:48] he didn't say go get me a drink he said
[31:50] if only I could taste the Waters of The
[31:52] Well of Bethlehem and because they loved
[31:54] him I believe because they loved him it
[31:56] became a great commandment to them and
[31:59] they risked their own lives they had to
[32:00] cut their way through the Philistine
[32:02] garrisons and all those things in order
[32:04] to get the drink for him so to me it was
[32:07] divine it was love
[32:09] I mean he governed his whole Kingdom
[32:12] This Is Me Now by love not by
[32:15] intimidation or by fear because remember
[32:18] geez remember David was a type of Christ
[32:21] amen so now that's just a shadow now
[32:24] here comes into the reality now we as I
[32:27] said about the you know about Paul
[32:30] or any of the Apostles or any of the
[32:32] Believers down through
[32:34] they would have gladly if they knew I
[32:36] believe because of divine love their
[32:38] life was led by Divine love they would
[32:40] have gladly been eaten by the Lions
[32:42] that would have been rejoicing
[32:44] I mean they would have they would have
[32:46] said yes Lord you know many of the
[32:47] martyrs you go read Fox's book of
[32:49] Martyrs they embraced their stake that
[32:51] they're going to get burnt at some of
[32:53] them requested not even to be tied to it
[32:55] they rejoiced amen because Divine love
[32:59] amen well it's not this this Chris real
[33:02] Christianity is not just something you
[33:04] join up to
[33:05] real Christianity is when the one who
[33:07] the king who came and died for you comes
[33:10] and lives in your life and then he
[33:12] doesn't lead you
[33:14] by fear you know I'm not a Christian
[33:16] because I'm scared of hell I'm not a
[33:18] scared of I'm not a Christian because
[33:20] I'm scared of being in the tribulation
[33:21] being left behind I am a Christian
[33:23] because of divine love
[33:25] Amen in my whole life and it should be
[33:27] the same thing with our families
[33:29] amen or church or whatever individually
[33:31] our entire walk how we administer
[33:35] how we administer this
[33:37] amen the message of the hour how we
[33:39] administer it must be by Divine love it
[33:43] must be administered by Divine love
[33:45] being a head of a house you must
[33:46] administer you know how you how you
[33:49] treat your family must be by Divine love
[33:52] I mean there they walk with God staying
[33:55] close as a family should be governed by
[33:58] Divine love
[33:59] remember Divine love does not vary based
[34:02] on circumstance like human love you can
[34:05] you can be nice to me one day and I love
[34:07] you you're mean to me the other day I
[34:08] probably won't love you that's human
[34:09] love but Divine love goes beyond that
[34:12] Divine love is beyond circumstance
[34:15] amen is the same thing with the believer
[34:17] now it doesn't matter if things are good
[34:19] or things are bad if Divine love is
[34:22] and broaden your heart by the Holy Ghost
[34:23] you love me anyway
[34:25] I mean so that's why it goes beyond you
[34:28] know how's your natural life going it
[34:30] doesn't really matter how natural life
[34:32] is going how's your walk with the Lord
[34:34] going
[34:35] amen because we are called we are led by
[34:38] Divine love it is more than just an idea
[34:42] it is more than just a Doctrine it must
[34:45] be a reality
[34:46] amen because the very Heart Of God was
[34:49] manifested in Jesus Christ
[34:51] amen and he gave himself for us
[34:54] Hallelujah he gave himself for us he
[34:57] shed his life out you know while we are
[34:58] yet enemies outside of the Commonwealth
[35:01] of Israel outside of the promise he died
[35:04] for us
[35:05] I mean it was divine love
[35:07] that took him to the took him to the
[35:09] cross the reason when the Roman soldier
[35:12] put the spear in his side and blood and
[35:14] water separated and came out of his body
[35:16] as two separate things is because he
[35:18] died of a broken heart
[35:19] because here was the heart of God
[35:22] coming to the Earth here was the heart
[35:24] of God being rejected they didn't know
[35:26] in the Old Testament really they knew
[35:28] who Jehovah was but he was a separate
[35:30] kind of God so I'm off somewhere but
[35:32] here he comes flesh here comes the heart
[35:34] of God and they took the heart of God
[35:37] put him on an altar put him on a cross
[35:39] and rejected him he came to his own but
[35:42] his own received him not but as many as
[35:44] received him gave him power to become
[35:45] the sons of God Amen Hallelujah even
[35:47] though even as many as believe on his
[35:49] name
[35:50] so this whole walk must be motivated by
[35:53] love
[35:54] amen if you let's go to I want to go to
[35:57] I think Hebrews chapter 2. so scripture
[35:59] comes to mind
[36:01] yes here it is
[36:02] I love the book of Hebrews
[36:04] I love God I love his delivering power I
[36:08] believe I'm so glad there's no fear
[36:10] perfect love casts out all fear
[36:13] amen now Hebrews 2
[36:15] and verse 14.
[36:17] just throw that one up and bold and
[36:19] underline it
[36:21] okay for as much they know he's speaking
[36:23] about how Jesus so he he goes from
[36:26] chapter one to chapter two and he's
[36:27] laying out to the Hebrews how Jesus was
[36:29] made a little lower than the angels He
[36:31] was made like one of us he was made he
[36:34] was born he was he was born sinless but
[36:36] he was born into the human race like we
[36:38] are bought and so he became out he
[36:41] became one of us
[36:42] amen and he said so
[36:45] for as much then
[36:47] as the children are partakers of Flesh
[36:49] and Blood that's us we we are in Flesh
[36:51] and Blood he also himself likewise took
[36:54] part of the same that through death
[36:57] he might destroy him wait do I have that
[36:59] one oh yes no next verse we'll just read
[37:01] this he might destroy him that had the
[37:03] power of death that is the devil now
[37:05] next verse is what I want to get to
[37:07] and deliver them
[37:09] who through fear of death were all their
[37:12] lifetime subject to bondage so he's
[37:16] saying he would deliver those
[37:18] Who deliver those who through the fear
[37:21] of death were a lifetime so he would
[37:22] deliver them who are under the fear of
[37:24] death
[37:25] so that's all Humanity people are scared
[37:28] religious people are scared
[37:30] are you following me you know people who
[37:33] it doesn't matter what religion you can
[37:34] be Catholic you can be a Muslim you can
[37:36] be a Hindu you can be a Seeker a Jain or
[37:39] a Methodist Presbyterian it doesn't
[37:41] matter what it is people have a fear
[37:45] and people motivate people to become
[37:47] Christians by fear that's not the way
[37:49] it's administered
[37:51] amen because they they tell people if
[37:53] you don't give your life you go to hell
[37:56] and some people become Christians
[37:57] motivated by fear
[37:59] we're not called to be motivated by fear
[38:02] amen it should be motivated by the
[38:04] Divine love there's a reason why brother
[38:07] bran when the angel came to him and he
[38:09] described the three pulls of his
[38:10] ministry are that you know there's the
[38:13] three phases or the three pulls it's
[38:14] because the reason it was called the
[38:16] pull is because there's a draw
[38:19] amen there was a there was a pull
[38:21] there's pulling people to to Christ and
[38:24] that's why love should pull you
[38:26] I'm in Divine love through the word
[38:28] should pull you to to him
[38:30] I mean it's not a push you're a beating
[38:32] you'll get a stick out and make people
[38:34] line up but it should be divine love
[38:36] should draw or soul
[38:37] says no man can come to unless my father
[38:40] draws them
[38:41] Hallelujah So Divine love must pull and
[38:44] that's why if we have lost lost loved
[38:47] ones or people who are not in yet that's
[38:48] why we need to call upon God God get a
[38:51] hold of them speak to them reveal
[38:54] yourself to them draw them Lord
[38:58] can we put that back up sorry
[39:00] so
[39:02] now if you fall in love
[39:05] if Divine love drops into your heart
[39:08] that all the fear of death
[39:11] we were all set
[39:13] who through the fear who through fear of
[39:15] death will all their lifetimes subject
[39:17] to bondage but then if Divine love drops
[39:21] in your heart which is the Holy Ghost
[39:22] God himself you're not you're not a
[39:24] slave you're not in bondage anymore
[39:26] you're free
[39:28] Hallelujah and that's why Paul or any of
[39:31] the Believers they were not they knew
[39:33] Paul knew what it was like to be
[39:35] delivered
[39:36] because imagine that you know you know
[39:38] the Jewish religion have I offered the
[39:41] right sacrifices have I won even the
[39:43] right you know you know it says don't
[39:45] mix the two types of material together
[39:48] you know have I done all the law because
[39:50] guilty the least is guilty of the whole
[39:53] you know have I ate the right food have
[39:55] I done the right things that would have
[39:57] put a real fear
[40:00] so he knew what it was like to be
[40:01] delivered
[40:03] Hallelujah where he knew he wasn't
[40:05] scared of his head being chopped off
[40:07] that day
[40:09] do you know they're going to cut your
[40:10] head off yep I know it wasn't brother
[40:12] talking about Peter I think Peter was in
[40:13] a prison with someone else you know are
[40:16] you Simon Peter yep he's in prison with
[40:18] another guy do you know they're going to
[40:19] kill you today yep are you scared nope
[40:22] are you sure yep you know and he begins
[40:25] to tell him the story he shares about
[40:26] this other guy with around dramatizing
[40:28] it he gives the testimony about how he
[40:30] met Jesus Christ and how he changed his
[40:32] life and then he is from the other side
[40:34] of the bar Simon Peter
[40:37] off he goes
[40:39] Hallelujah
[40:40] Paul would've been the same way
[40:43] Hallelujah you mean you mean my Earthly
[40:45] journey is done I've run my race I've
[40:48] finished my course a Crown of Life is
[40:50] awaiting me Hallelujah I'm ready he
[40:54] wasn't scared I think that's crazy
[40:56] that's not crazy if Divine love is
[40:59] sunken into your soul
[41:01] amen amen and by the cross of Calvary
[41:04] Divine Love Is Now released upon the
[41:06] Earth where we are governed individually
[41:09] by Divine love everything we do for the
[41:11] Lord should be motivated by love because
[41:13] of its love it's not human works
[41:16] amen it's not human works if your Mo if
[41:19] your life is motivated by love then it's
[41:21] not works
[41:23] because if you do it from out of love
[41:25] you don't make a list in your mind but
[41:27] I've done this this and this and this
[41:29] it's all Lord I love thee this is why I
[41:31] live this way
[41:32] Hallelujah
[41:34] so
[41:36] I said these things
[41:39] because
[41:40] this is what Christianity is
[41:43] it shouldn't be fear you know when I
[41:45] think of the rapture
[41:47] what I think of when I think of the
[41:49] wedding supper and leaving this Earth it
[41:52] makes me so happy
[41:54] amen because if Divine love drops in
[41:56] your heart you recognize that
[41:58] sovereignly given
[41:59] amen you know that you did not earn it
[42:02] you did not uh it wasn't seven steps to
[42:06] the rapture
[42:07] and and and some self-help book but it
[42:10] was God divinely coming to you amen it's
[42:13] one thing for man to call upon God but
[42:15] when God responds hallelujah amen that's
[42:18] the Glorious thing and so that's why
[42:20] it's an incredible thing where if
[42:22] there's a longing in here there's a
[42:24] longing to respond if there's a if
[42:27] there's a hunger I want to know the god
[42:29] that made all things then there's a God
[42:31] who made all things and he is the Lord
[42:33] Jesus Christ because you had a prophet
[42:35] stand in this day and he spoke life into
[42:38] existence he spoke tumors out of
[42:40] existence he spoke storms out of
[42:42] existence there's a power of creation
[42:44] through his word and that was not him
[42:46] that was God through him that was God
[42:48] proving I am the Creator and I am
[42:51] speaking through this man
[42:52] Hallelujah that's true that's why those
[42:55] things were done
[42:56] amen glory to God that's a Vindication
[42:59] this word is true because the Creator
[43:01] himself has never happened before
[43:04] amen
[43:05] and so now you say well if there's a
[43:08] longing for God there's a longing
[43:09] there's a God to meet that longing and
[43:12] the goddess was there before that
[43:14] longing ever dropped into your soul
[43:16] amen so don't let the devil rob you or
[43:20] don't push it to one side because if you
[43:22] have a longing you're the most blessed
[43:24] person amen you have the greatest thing
[43:26] you can't buy it you can't earn it you
[43:29] can't work it out you can't sit an exam
[43:31] and obtain it in any way it's just there
[43:34] Hallelujah
[43:36] yeah amen you say well you say that all
[43:39] the time it's a glorious thing
[43:41] Bill Gates and all of his wealth can't
[43:43] buy it
[43:44] amen amen America with all its wealth
[43:46] couldn't buy it for a single salt
[43:48] Hallelujah New Zealand surely couldn't
[43:50] buy it
[43:51] amen it's just given without money or
[43:54] price
[43:55] so that means you can't do anything in
[43:57] your own do I have to memorize this do I
[44:02] have to walk crawl up some steps and say
[44:04] some hell Mary is saying no sir you've
[44:07] just got to give yourself
[44:08] you're gonna say Lord take my life and
[44:10] make it thine
[44:12] amen and that is all Peter said repent
[44:15] be baptized name of Lord Jesus Christ
[44:17] for the mission of sin and you shall
[44:19] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you
[44:22] shall be led by Divine love
[44:24] halleluia
[44:25] amen such a glorious thing so
[44:30] we shouldn't be scared
[44:34] you say well I'm scared
[44:36] of being left behind you don't have to
[44:38] stay scared
[44:39] you don't have to be scared God remember
[44:42] to me Christianity you can see it's it
[44:45] is it is the religion
[44:47] because you can see the death burial
[44:49] Resurrection in nature
[44:51] it is the only religion I mean real
[44:54] Bible Christianity that you can actually
[44:56] see it and see it and come into a family
[45:00] amen you see it with with parents and
[45:02] with children
[45:03] how God has got a God is a god of
[45:06] stability
[45:08] he wants you to be stable just like a
[45:10] parent you know like my girls when they
[45:12] play a game you're the mummy bear I'm
[45:14] the daddy I mean yo I'm the daddy bear
[45:17] mommy's The Mummy bear we're the baby
[45:18] bears or we're playing Eagles and I'm
[45:21] the daddy Eagle mum is the mummy eagle
[45:23] and they're the baby eagles there's
[45:24] always this family unit because it
[45:26] brings stability
[45:27] there's something built in them I need
[45:29] to know what I where where do I fit who
[45:32] am I
[45:33] and that's because now man is looking
[45:35] for that guy thing and that's how but
[45:36] that's how God is God wants you to know
[45:38] I'm I am your father
[45:41] you came out of me
[45:43] Hallelujah came out of me I birthed you
[45:45] upon this Earth amen you have my jeans
[45:48] in you Hallelujah you're part of me I'm
[45:51] your father and I'll look after you and
[45:53] I'll guide you through this life amen I
[45:55] want you to know that man amen that's
[45:58] why the first prayer Our Father a child
[46:00] in heaven Hallowed be thy name our
[46:02] father not o great Jehovah someplace Our
[46:05] Father which art in heaven so he wants
[46:08] you to know and that's why it's so you
[46:10] know that's why the Apostle Paul he
[46:11] takes Ephesians he takes many places in
[46:13] the scripture and he and he places he he
[46:16] God emphasizes so much who you are and
[46:19] what Christ has done
[46:21] amen so you see it in a family
[46:23] you see it in nature you see this Bible
[46:26] is set everywhere
[46:28] that God has made and to me that shows
[46:30] that this is true
[46:32] amen and it's been Vindicated thousands
[46:34] thousands of times but I mean you see
[46:36] naturally
[46:37] and so
[46:39] if we know then so he wants it as I said
[46:42] if you're afraid
[46:43] let him take the fear away
[46:46] don't be motivated by fear be motivated
[46:49] by love
[46:51] amen it's all about relationship
[46:54] now
[46:57] how we doing we're doing okay
[47:01] it's all about relationship and that's
[47:03] why
[47:04] that's why it's so important as parents
[47:07] they need to see god with skin on
[47:10] amen because how they relate to God will
[47:13] be actually how you've related to them
[47:16] amen so if you're so if you're a parent
[47:20] or a father will go down the farther way
[47:22] because that's well it's both ways but
[47:24] you know if you're a father that's
[47:27] always making them unsettled then who
[47:29] and who their identity is and pushing
[47:32] them away and being distant and putting
[47:34] complexes in them they'll think God's
[47:36] like that God's distant
[47:38] you know there'll be unstability in the
[47:40] walk subconsciously because that's being
[47:43] come down through the parent
[47:44] are you with me
[47:46] I mean all those things will be down
[47:48] through but then if we're parents where
[47:49] we're you're my child
[47:51] I tell my children all the time I'm your
[47:53] dad
[47:54] you're my girls
[47:56] your mommy's girls we're a family I'm
[48:00] the daddy I'm the daddy bear or the
[48:01] daddy eagle or the whatever
[48:03] amen I want them to know
[48:05] you know because now they know well this
[48:07] is mummy and daddy and and we're there
[48:09] and they love us and we love them and
[48:11] we're a family and it brings great
[48:13] stability in the life
[48:14] just as a little two by four you know I
[48:16] may get you know it does a that's a
[48:18] great stability
[48:19] and God wants it to be the same way
[48:22] and so do not let fear govern your
[48:25] Christian walk
[48:26] you don't have to stay that way
[48:29] amen you say well see because for me I
[48:31] said as God gives an assurance I have
[48:33] perfect assurance
[48:35] that I am going
[48:37] because I love him
[48:39] and the reason I love him is because I
[48:41] gave my life to him and he has received
[48:44] Me by his grace and if he has led me
[48:47] this far if I've made it this far
[48:49] amen if I've made it above the world
[48:52] Hallelujah and he's changed my nature
[48:54] and changed my my whole look of the life
[48:57] and my my ambitions hopes and plans are
[49:00] not to be a religious person or to make
[49:03] some Empire but to serve him amen
[49:05] amen if I've cast all my cares upon them
[49:07] if I've committed my life into his hands
[49:09] because he says all that come to me are
[49:11] no wise cast out
[49:13] right that's what he says he's not a man
[49:14] that can lie so I've given everything I
[49:16] am to him
[49:18] and he's received me so if he received
[49:21] me here I know he's going to receive me
[49:22] there
[49:23] amen I I just trust it comes out what
[49:26] I'm saying right but you've got to
[49:27] understand if I've committed my life and
[49:29] I love him you know you imagine someone
[49:32] humanly and this is not possible but a
[49:36] human being that you love that's never
[49:37] disappointed you one time
[49:40] you think about it you think someone
[49:42] who's always been there he's always he's
[49:45] never failed you you think you know just
[49:46] imagine if you had someone like that
[49:48] their word is always true they have no
[49:50] flaw in their character they never have
[49:52] any you say that they have real no
[49:54] Humanity because they're always perfect
[49:55] their word is always true they always do
[49:58] what they say they're always there for
[50:00] you
[50:00] if you committed your life into their
[50:02] hands
[50:03] you knew based on their character they
[50:05] won't value
[50:06] I'm speaking humanly speaking remember
[50:08] Jesus God became a man
[50:11] amen so if that's the case just
[50:13] naturally how much more with God
[50:16] okay
[50:19] we have come I'm not scared
[50:22] my life is in his hands
[50:24] whatever happens happens
[50:28] and that is true I'm not afraid of what
[50:30] tomorrow faces
[50:33] if the whole world turns against us or
[50:35] against me with this walk I'll say I'm
[50:37] sorry I can't
[50:39] I would gladly go I understand why the
[50:41] martyrs could go
[50:43] I actually understand
[50:45] because yet having not seen yet love
[50:48] with joy unspeakable full of Glory
[50:51] how could you how could you deny the one
[50:53] you love the one you've identified
[50:54] yourself with amen the one that means
[50:57] the most you in all your life well
[50:59] you've never seen this one before Oh but
[51:01] I know
[51:02] he speaks to me I speak back to him his
[51:05] presence comes down I'm motivated by
[51:07] love they went into the Coliseum by love
[51:11] amen they went to the stake by love
[51:14] they were ripped apart because you know
[51:16] they they went gladly
[51:19] it's not fair or if I do this and he'll
[51:22] do this no
[51:23] the Hebrew children if they were they
[51:25] were believers they said well if they if
[51:27] God delivers us he will if he doesn't he
[51:29] doesn't we're going to go anyway
[51:32] amen
[51:35] so a whole life should be governed by
[51:37] Divine love
[51:39] now we've come to this evening
[51:42] and it's always a very important time
[51:48] I'd like this one to be a
[51:51] you know the communion
[51:53] you think of Jesus now
[51:55] those last few moments upon the Earth
[51:58] before East crucified
[52:01] he takes the cup
[52:03] you know he begins to speak just
[52:05] disciples about many things
[52:09] and
[52:11] life was going to change
[52:13] life the world changed that you know
[52:14] those few days the world changed
[52:16] drastically
[52:18] and it's the same with the
[52:20] the same with uh you know the Israelites
[52:22] going out of Egypt the Passover night
[52:25] the world has changed they're not slaves
[52:28] anymore
[52:29] very few moments not very long after
[52:31] that they are walking free
[52:33] going going to another world
[52:37] we
[52:39] if you're a Christian tonight
[52:43] somewhere down life's Road you gave your
[52:45] life to him
[52:47] and Assurance came in
[52:49] that you are going to another world
[52:51] that you know where you're going
[52:54] and when we take the Lord's Supper take
[52:57] the communion
[52:59] we are doing this in remembrance of him
[53:03] we are remembering the Lord's death
[53:05] remember the penalty of sin was an
[53:07] incredible thing
[53:09] where God had to become a man to fulfill
[53:11] his own law to take the Wrath that
[53:14] should have been poured out upon us he
[53:16] gladly took it upon himself
[53:18] Hallelujah that's Divine love because he
[53:22] couldn't lose he couldn't lose part of
[53:24] himself
[53:25] so he gladly put on human flesh there's
[53:28] the joy that was set before him was you
[53:30] redeemed
[53:32] amen
[53:33] The Joy it says the joy that was set
[53:35] before him he despised the cross you
[53:38] know you know he gladly embraced the
[53:40] cross because there was a joy before him
[53:42] I'm going to have a people
[53:44] they're going to be Redeemed by my blood
[53:46] they're going to be you know they're
[53:47] going to be I'm going to Ransom them
[53:49] with my blood I'm going to take their
[53:51] sin
[53:52] upon me I'm going to carry it up Calvary
[53:54] as a man
[53:55] because it was a joy set before him
[53:59] here we are in life's journey I trust
[54:01] there's a joy it was so real to him
[54:04] he was a man he had to believe the word
[54:06] like we have to believe the word because
[54:08] he was all God but it was all man
[54:10] right so he had to have the the word was
[54:13] revealed to him that he would not his he
[54:16] would not uh God so his he would not be
[54:18] in the ground I will not suffer thy Holy
[54:21] One to see corruption he had that as the
[54:24] scripture that he went to Calvary with
[54:25] that he knew that his body he wouldn't
[54:28] be left in the Tomb but he had resurrect
[54:30] again before corruption set in that was
[54:32] but so but the joy that was set before
[54:35] him was us around a wedding supper table
[54:38] he comes out in his glory
[54:40] I mean after all the bibles are closed
[54:42] the arms are stacked and we're gone up
[54:44] to Father's House
[54:45] amen and we're sitting around the
[54:47] wedding supper table however however
[54:50] it's arranged I don't know I'm not too
[54:52] worried about the details and then the
[54:54] doors open then he walks down
[54:57] that's great splendor
[54:59] he says and he wipes away all tears you
[55:02] don't need to cry anymore children
[55:03] it's all over
[55:05] and the thing is we'll have to stop
[55:07] crying there's something in us we'll
[55:09] just stop you'll come wipe away all the
[55:10] tears it's all right
[55:12] Hallelujah this was the joy set before

[55:19] you being redeemed we should have a joy
[55:21] we're going to a wedding supper
[55:23] Hallelujah and that's why when we take
[55:26] the communion we should say thank you
[55:28] God you came and paid the you became me
[55:31] you became sin that I'd become your very
[55:34] righteousness and I wasn't looking for
[55:37] you I wasn't didn't have some ambition
[55:39] when I was first born I wanna I wanna
[55:41] meet you but something in me I'm a human
[55:44] the you're the human spirit
[55:47] the kind of humanity does not seek after
[55:50] God
[55:51] doesn't seek it says in the Book of
[55:53] Romans not 1 6 after him
[55:55] not one so there has to be something
[55:58] beyond your Humanity crying out
[56:01] Hallelujah I'm so glad for that aren't
[56:04] you friends
[56:05] amen and you may not be able to put it
[56:07] in words to begin with but I'll tell you
[56:10] it's because there's a joy set before
[56:11] you I mean there's a wedding supper
[56:14] table and so now when we come to the
[56:17] communion because he he gives us such an
[56:19] assurance I trust you have that
[56:22] Assurance I won't leave you nor forsake
[56:24] you I'll go with you I'll lead you
[56:27] through every dark place though I walk
[56:29] through the valley of the shadow of
[56:30] death I'll fear no evil for thou art
[56:32] with me amen I won't leave you upon the
[56:34] Earth I'm going to take you off this
[56:36] Earth amen because of my sacrifice that
[56:39] day on Calvary Hallelujah I'm going to
[56:42] take you away
[56:43] Hallelujah because of love we love him
[56:45] it's just a shadow of how he feels about
[56:48] you
[56:49] you mean well there's no Great Value in
[56:51] me you don't know what you are to him
[56:54] I mean when the where the prophet of God
[56:55] said one soul is worth ten thousand
[56:58] worlds
[56:59] you can't put a price on 10 000 worlds
[57:02] one sold's worth ten thousand worlds
[57:04] that's the value he puts on you
[57:07] Hallelujah and he doesn't and he never
[57:09] and it is great thinking I don't believe
[57:12] you have said
[57:13] well ten thousand worlds times however
[57:16] many redeemed can I afford it
[57:20] he didn't weigh it up he just went
[57:22] Hallelujah So Adam quickly took Eve to
[57:25] us himself amen
[57:28] sorry it's glorious friends he doesn't
[57:31] weigh it up he just came
[57:33] remember the first promise the first
[57:35] prophecy ever given in the Bible is the
[57:37] seed of the woman
[57:39] will Bruce the head of the seat of the
[57:40] serpent that was the first promise of
[57:43] the Redeemer coming
[57:44] Hallelujah the first promise
[57:47] amen I'm coming Hallelujah and he came
[57:50] in the flesh died for you and I Rose
[57:53] forevermore sent a spirit down upon the
[57:55] Earth
[57:56] amen thank you and here he is today in
[57:59] 2017. brooding over Humanity in a
[58:02] drawers to himself
[58:04] amen and that's why we should be so glad
[58:07] when we take the communion Lord you
[58:08] promised me
[58:09] you're not a man that can lie
[58:12] I'm not I'm not taking this out of fear
[58:14] I love you and whatever you want to do
[58:16] with me Glory Be unto thee
[58:19] Hallelujah brother Brown was told one
[58:21] day
[58:22] I may get the story mixed up with
[58:24] another one but he but he said about how
[58:26] someone said well you're an antichrist
[58:29] and he said well if that's what the Lord
[58:31] wants me to be that's what I'll be
[58:33] and he and he and he said he said that
[58:36] if God would cast him to hell he'll
[58:39] worship Him Anyway
[58:41] amen because Divine love so governed his
[58:44] life Hallelujah redeeming love was his
[58:47] thing
[58:48] and it should be our theme as well
[58:51] amen and I had the same
[58:53] not to put myself in that bracket but I
[58:55] remember when I was first a you know a
[58:57] Believer and the devil Twisted the
[59:00] scripture against me saying if you sin
[59:02] willfully after receiving the knowledge
[59:04] of the truth there's no more sacrifice
[59:05] for sin
[59:07] and he basically Twisted in my mind if
[59:09] it's like if you're a little child and
[59:11] your parents say don't do it for you go
[59:13] do it then it's then you're out there's
[59:15] no more sacrifice and my heart literally
[59:18] went like a lead lead balloon
[59:21] but then I came to the conclusion
[59:24] I was actually it's amazing what happens
[59:25] in someone's heart when you're just
[59:27] mopping a floor
[59:28] as I was working in the kitchen I just
[59:30] mopping in Florida this was going on and
[59:32] um and just like a lead weight
[59:35] but then I just read the supernatural
[59:36] books where brother Brandon was talking
[59:38] to brother Billy Paul
[59:40] before he goes out into the world you
[59:41] know and he's and and they're outside
[59:44] washing the car
[59:45] and brother Bram tells Billy Paul to
[59:47] stand like this and his shadow made a
[59:49] cross on the wall
[59:51] and brother Bram said to him you're here
[59:53] like at the intersection which way are
[59:55] you gonna go which arm are you going to
[59:57] go and I came to the conclusion well
[59:59] Lord there's no way the world has
[1:00:02] nothing for me I don't want to go back
[1:00:04] so I must just take down this arm I'm
[1:00:06] going this way I said well at least at
[1:00:09] least you know if you do cast me to hell
[1:00:12] at least I get an opportunity one day to
[1:00:14] stand before you face to face and tell
[1:00:16] you that I love you and then you can do
[1:00:18] what you want with me
[1:00:19] Hallelujah
[1:00:21] amen do I feel any better no I didn't
[1:00:24] feel any better next hour went to church
[1:00:26] had a glorious time
[1:00:27] hallelujah amen that's Divine love
[1:00:32] amen I trust you feel the same way you
[1:00:34] should feel the same way oh you say it's
[1:00:36] an emotion anything without emotion is
[1:00:38] dead the prophet says
[1:00:40] amen because when when the pressure
[1:00:43] really comes on he'll come upon the
[1:00:45] scene amen and his love will come back
[1:00:47] to your mind come back to your heart but
[1:00:49] he means too much to me
[1:00:51] why would I want to do anything contrary
[1:00:52] to his word he means too much to me
[1:00:55] amen I trust you feel the same way
[1:00:59] Hallelujah so
[1:01:01] now let's just read let's just turn to
[1:01:03] First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:01:07] so it's a glorious occasion
[1:01:10] he promised he's taking us away
[1:01:12] I do not believe we're going down some
[1:01:14] Garden Path I do not believe it I
[1:01:17] believe we are walking in the perfect
[1:01:19] will of God I believe we are walking up
[1:01:22] to heaven I believe he's molding and
[1:01:25] shaping us into his image and I was
[1:01:27] thinking the other day you know my girls
[1:01:30] even though they're girls they are made
[1:01:32] in my image
[1:01:34] right they may only be this big but
[1:01:37] they're still made in my image right
[1:01:38] it's just an immature image of me it
[1:01:42] just needs to mature and grow
[1:01:43] right so when people say oh we're Made
[1:01:46] In His Image sometimes we put it off you
[1:01:48] know as in we need to be the fullness of
[1:01:50] the Statue of Christ and then we're Made
[1:01:51] In His Image now when you're birthed
[1:01:54] amen when you're birthed your maiden is
[1:01:56] image but you just need to grow and
[1:01:57] mature Hallelujah I'm glad we grow and
[1:02:00] mature in him I mean so I Believe by
[1:02:03] God's Sovereign Grace we are walking
[1:02:05] with him
[1:02:07] I believe it I believe that this is not
[1:02:09] cunningly devised fables of man
[1:02:11] I believe that we are walking the Holy
[1:02:14] Spirit has taken us by the I say the
[1:02:16] heart and is leading us individually up
[1:02:19] into the rapture
[1:02:21] I believe with all my heart
[1:02:24] amen and I believe
[1:02:26] God by his Spirit comes down among us
[1:02:29] and not just in church wherever we are
[1:02:31] he comes out and confirms his word to
[1:02:33] you because he wants you to know you're
[1:02:36] not just going with the crowd
[1:02:38] Hallelujah you're not just going with
[1:02:40] the crowd but I have got a hold of you
[1:02:43] you've given my life you've given me
[1:02:45] your life and I'm leading you
[1:02:48] have that Assurance I trust you do
[1:02:51] amen and the beautiful thing is it's all
[1:02:54] his work
[1:02:56] amen Divine love
[1:02:59] now First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:03:03] we'll go verse 23.
[1:03:05] ah so glad to be a Christian
[1:03:08] Hallelujah
[1:03:13] I'd rather have the worst day ever as a
[1:03:16] believer
[1:03:17] then the best day you could ever have in
[1:03:19] the world
[1:03:20] I would rather have
[1:03:22] you couldn't pay me to have that best
[1:03:24] day I'd rather have the worst day as a
[1:03:26] believer
[1:03:27] Hallelujah
[1:03:29] for I've received of the Lord that which
[1:03:31] also I've delivered unto you
[1:03:34] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:03:36] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:03:38] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:03:40] it and said take eat this is my body
[1:03:42] which is broken for you this still in
[1:03:46] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:03:48] also he took the cup when he had stopped
[1:03:51] saying this cup is the New Testament of
[1:03:54] my blood this do ye as off as you drink
[1:03:57] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:04:00] ye eat this bread and drink this cup you
[1:04:02] do show the Lord's death till he come
[1:04:06] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:04:09] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:04:11] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:04:15] and the blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:04:17] examine himself
[1:04:19] so and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:04:22] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:04:24] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:04:26] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:04:29] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:04:32] and sickly among you many sleep for if
[1:04:34] ye would judge if we would judge
[1:04:36] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:04:39] when we are judged we shall be chastened
[1:04:41] to the Lord that we should not be
[1:04:43] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:04:46] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:04:48] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:04:50] hunger let him eat at home that ye come
[1:04:53] not together under condemnation and the
[1:04:55] rest will I set in order when I come
[1:04:59] so when you come
[1:05:01] if you come and partake of the Lord's
[1:05:03] table
[1:05:05] you should do it because you're a
[1:05:06] Christian you're a believer
[1:05:08] and that everything is under the blood
[1:05:11] right
[1:05:12] the table is open to anyone whosoever
[1:05:15] will but you've got to examine it says
[1:05:16] let a man examine himself
[1:05:19] okay
[1:05:20] so it's a glorious time because on one
[1:05:23] hand
[1:05:24] remember the the unleavened bread and
[1:05:27] the wine they're just symbolic they're
[1:05:28] not literal doesn't literally turn into
[1:05:31] his body and it's symbolic but you are
[1:05:34] giving a public testimony I have become
[1:05:36] part of him
[1:05:38] amen I am I am one with my Lord Jesus
[1:05:41] Christ I'm identified with this death
[1:05:43] burial Resurrection
[1:05:45] and
[1:05:47] so it's not a it's a symbolic thing but
[1:05:50] you're making a testimony I've become
[1:05:52] one he's he's enjoined himself to me
[1:05:55] so it's a glorious thing because one is
[1:05:56] you're showing everyone he's given me
[1:05:58] the promise I'm going
[1:06:00] right but on the other hand you've got
[1:06:03] to examine yourself that everything's
[1:06:05] right
[1:06:07] okay so it's not just a ritual
[1:06:09] redeem us back to yourself
[1:06:11] so father
