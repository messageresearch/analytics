you can be seated hallelujah hallelujah amen do you know if I'm just gonna everything's got a testimony on their heart please feel free to come and share other Gideon everybody okay um just want to say something small with you you know we sometimes we looked at the Lord for big things when you when you're sick you wanna get come to the Lord and you want to get healed and those are big things and it's and it's wonderful things but the Lord deals in small things and we oftentimes miss what he does in small things so just a small testimony yesterday morning my my wife realized she left a dryer at home and she had a problem she couldn't draw her hair and you know as much as as men would think that's not a major just let it drop drying stand in the wind and made a dry you realize that for for the for the sisters that's a major thing because they've got along and they've got problems so just when I appreciate the sisters with along me this morning and so we we feel for you with the trouble you go through with you along and so we appreciate that anyway I decided I need to get my wife a hair dryer so I got in the car and googled the closest shopping st. there and because one I could find was about 17 minutes away so I got on the car top are not off at home and I went hunting for this a dryer for this hadrian so an amazing su Drive closer to the shopping st. that you realize that everything becomes more and more sugar-coated and it's glitter and glamour and the closer you get to the shopping center your your whole being just starts to resist being there you don't want to be there because this is the world full on you know Mike got into the parking area and I I started praying this I I realized Lord I don't know what to look for I don't know wait to find this thing and I just don't want to be here because there's always people around you you know let me think of brother branham when he went beyond the curtain of time the first time when he got shot in his leg he saw people down and he'll and he'll and then he came to JCPenney shopping center and he saw those exact same people in a shopping center and then he went beyond the curtain of time and saw the signs over there and he came back and he said I saw all of you on the other side so I realized in the shopping center is hell is on earth and heaven is on earth people that are already bound and all lust is walking there and we that already free is walking also then and it's hell on earth Ellen heaven mixed together on earth anyway as I was walking I prayed huh asked Lord where do I find this here dry and I walked up and down and couldn't find the right shop and he ain't sure I remember my wife goes to farmers quite often I thought of writing he is a farm I should walk in and walked in the door and I asked Lord where do I find this hy I've got no idea where the hit erisa so I walked in and turn right and it's a shelf full of hair dryers and I said which hair dryer and I could do the hit dryers and they were all half-price Thank You lot you're amazing brought me to the right place [Applause] let's say anything but I told myself it is brother Andy I would just share something it's not very much but um I just I'm sorry full of gratitude and love to the Lord I give to share it and yeah like I I got my testimony a year and a half ago when the Lord meet me for the first time and that was the first time in my life that I knew I was saved and sealed and it was wonderful and that has never left but the last year and a half has been very up and down emotionally just feeling really unstable coming to Wellington and getting feared life and then going home and there's nothing there it's just being a real - real turmoil and it's been really hard and I've just been wanting to move to Burlington and I can just live life you know it's just being that's been pretty rough but and it just got to the point where it's just I felt like I don't know maybe some sort of depression I don't know it was it was getting I just felt like I had no spark to really go on you know just it was just horrible and this last time and like a month ago when we came I knew that I had to get bit thought it was just had to be as I was totally over living as I was I could not go on anymore and and I knew that if I could get rather been to pray for me it would believe and yeah I've been paid to me and the chain broke you know and it's just I knew that it's gone I'm fine I've got total trust in the Lord no matter what happens we I will glorify the god and the board wherever I'm standing and yeah just we have a special study Nelson that's wonderful and like sign o the Lord is leading us it doesn't matter where we are and I'm just so relieved and so excited and yeah life is great the Lord oh yeah thank you yeah which is so great anyone else [Music] I've got a small testimony I just felt on my heart to share it but that's actually a really old testimony but hello you know the Lord has a purpose but so when I first actually gave my life to the Lord before there I used to drink a lot of beer and we'd have a lot of beer and every day after work we were drinking heaps the boys and then then the Lord saved me I already knew about God but I hadn't given my life to him I gave my life to Him and even after I gave my life to my Stallwood I wouldn't get drunk but I would go and have a couple of beers with the boys and just you know as a social thing and and then and then what happened was I I loved God so much that all I wanted to do was spend time in the Bible and read the Bible I just all I wanted to do was read the Bible and I just open it and just have a wonderful time reading and having a jubilee and it was really awesome and I would do that for hours and hours and hours you know here you can imagine a dry desert land and drinking water it was just soaking it up and so all I want to do is was lie my bed my dad thought I was crazy my mum thought I was crazy because all I wanted to do is stay in my room and read the Bible because I got saved you know I really met God and you know I was still doing this a couple of beers here and there and then oh the Lord just basically took it away because I would be I have a couple of beers and then I come home after work and I couldn't I'd read my Bible for 10 minutes and then I go to sleep because I was kind of just you know lightheaded and not quite was it because you even though you're not getting drunk he's still you're actually robbing God and and I was fraught I felt like I was robbing God of my might me and having time and so I was like well a Christian can do what they want and he took away my desire for it so I didn't want it anymore I don't have a thirst for it and it was just a social thing I said oh well there's no point in doing this if every time I drink even one I'm gonna just fall asleep and all I wanted to do was spend time with them yeah so that was that was my story yeah so praise the Lord Amen sister Mufti please come and share your song [Applause] god bless you Oh these last few weeks we've had great turmoil and trials and but it was all for God's glory you know when God brings you to a place where you praise him for the trials it is a very good place to be in and I thought too brother Gideon yesterday about it and it's really a very good place to be in it's very blessed the most amazing thing is that our friends came to church and it was not about going to church ever that's not the point the point is about witnessing God and seeing God in our lives and and there was this amazing thing where we you know we had to go to some lawyers basically and our friends went there had a meeting and when they came here to this church they heard father been saying exactly what the lawyer said and to them there was such a witness of God and to us well it was such a rejoice and and from that point on you don't even care what the outcome is gonna be you know you just let God deal with everything and let God you know it's like watching a video I didn't you know watching your life and say what God is going to do and and you've come to that point you know you thank God for being in that point you know sometimes God's shakes things and puts everything back to where it's supposed to be in the on his solid foundation or ours and you know it's the best place to be and we thank God for this the trials are not important at all they don't matter what matters is God and there is no end to him either like what we witness it's a great thing but it's the beginning and there's no end to him he's infinite this there's more and more than we can get of God every day we thank you for it Oh bless you [Applause] [Music] [Music] down by the river is waiting for me to bathe me in a

these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen let's just go to the scripture and we'll go to Matthew 27 and I want to entitle this this morning my Thanksgiving my Thanksgiving Alleluia we have a lot to be thankful for and I was I was just looking at this last night of thought I don't have time that's why we'll have eternity to praise Him I mean cuz I've got a lot to be thankful for now this may seem like strange scripture to read from but we have in Matthew 27 and we're going to read verses 62 and we're gonna read down to verse 66 and then we've got to go to Micah chapter 7 you can have your seats after we finish reading here in Matthew it says now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I'll rise again command therefore that the simple could be made sure until the third day least his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so that the last error shall be worse than the first Pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch Amen may the Lord bless us would you may have your seats and when I read that I was thinking good luck good luck to you trying to do that and let's go to Micah chapter 7 and we're going to read two verses from Micah 7 maybe we'll just put it on the screen here it says and this is a very precious scripture to me because we have an enemy but he's defeated it says therefore I will look unto the Lord I will wait for the God of my salvation my God will hear me rejoice not against me own mine enemy when I fall I shall arise when I sit and darkness the Lord shall be light unto me a mint now we read there and and Matthew chapter 27 where where Jesus had they had crucified him they had put his body was placed in the tomb and then the scribes and Pharisees the religious order of the churches that they were worried that that the disciples would steal his body away so they go to hear it and they they and they say you know we need some soldiers we need to seal this tomb we need to make sure his body cannot be taken by night because if his body is taken then the disciples will say that you know he has risen and they even said that he is a deceiver it's amazing actually the deceivers were accusing the righteous one of being the deceiver and how true it even is today because brother Branham says it and we'll come to it later when he speaks of when he preaches it as the rising of the Sun and it's more than a sermon if you haven't heard that it is the rising of the Sun recently you should go listen because it's not a sermon it's a declaration I mean the Sun has risen hallelujah is not talking about the natural sunlight and he's talking about the supernatural son of God amen his his son has risen hallelujah he's been he was in a tomb Amen a denominational to him for nearly 2,000 years I mean but the devil couldn't stop him from rising hallelujah he couldn't stop him rising in the first resurrection amen and he couldn't stop him rising out of history in this hour hallelujah and he couldn't stop you rising I mean because brother Bram says what a resurrection that was this is what a resurrection this is I mean were a people who are dead I mean their bodies were their lives are sealed away you're the devil had a tomb for you I mean even before you were born he had a term for you hallelujah any and he had it prepared I mean he had some God sitting over that term he and a bunch of devils over your life hallelujah to keep you in that tomb and it was sealed by a sealed holy because he because he said to God your children will not come forth Amen she will not be redeemed your children will not come forth hallelujah because Jesus said all of the father has given me will come to me amen in the devil heard that he said they will not come to you I mean they will not he's determined that you will not and he wants to keep you if he can keep your religious he'll keep your religious I mean if you'll keep you with a bit of religion and a few courts and a few scriptures he'll keep you that way amen you know the devil doesn't care how religious you are I mean but you got to be totally separated to God I'm in this message as a total deliverance it's a total separation to our Lord hallelujah we're not called just to carry around worldly atmosphere around us I mean this this gospel could not be made nice for the world it cannot be made like an Instagram photo wherever anything looks good it could not be made niceness messages never been made good yo was never palatable to the world it was never palatable in Jesus's day here was the resurrection of life standing upon the earth and they hated him the churches didn't say isn't this lovely and he calls Lazarus from the grave and they got even angrier and they wanted even to kill Lazarus I mean here was a for a god that led them out of Egypt was now in flesh and he was gathering his children amen and the religion they had couldn't couldn't set Legion free I mean couldn't set the woman at the well free maybe she learned a whole bunch of psychology but the psychology didn't do anything for her maybe some nice you know positive thinking and you know you're on your journey and this is how things are but you're stuck she was stuck in a tomb she couldn't be freed but then the resurrection came her way hallelujah and that man problems she had amen it was gone I mean she wasn't bound by that anymore and they hated him the head of the Resurrection same thing today you know I need whoa well you know the place where where I had my 30th birthday so after that my wife goes to give the key back and then the the janitor or whoever gave us the key he said he said to my wife you know if I knew you're from this church we'd never have hired it to you what prejudice you know bit but why is that because they hate the life they actually hate it that's why you you know we can talk about the cross and that's my Thanksgiving I'm free I mean what what he did for me that day it's manifested in me I mean I'm free hallelujah and I'm actually free not partially free I think I'm free I'm free hallelujah he paid my freedom and I've walked out under that freedom hallelujah but you know you can talk about Calvary - yeah you can talk about what God did in the past anyone you can have good fellowship and it can even be special but then you come down to the cellar where is he today where is he today and they say away with such people you're a you're in a cult you're in a sect and I was thinking you know I think it's the Catholic people is the system that holds them back but they literally believe when they take the communion that when the priest blesses it praise for it and literally turns into his flesh and turns into his blood and they literally if they really believe what they're doing they're eating human flesh and they're drinking human blood now that's crazy that's crazy but yet they will say these people are in a cult and they believe they're eating human flesh and drinking human blood and it's accepted in the world this world has gone mad but it was crazy it was crazy when Jesus came the first time came the first time they see it away with such a fellow but yet they had to acknowledge we know that you're a teacher come from God because no man can do these things and this God is with them but they had to make their choice and they held on to their tomb you don't have to hold on to your tomb doesn't matter I'm not speaking against people but it's spirits that hold people back it's spirits that bind they even maybe want to be free but something eminence did you they just want to hold onto their safety zone you know the Stockholm Syndrome where they with a with a hostage action because to love the one who kidnapped them and it's the same thing actually in the spiritual world where people begin to love the devil that's bound them and they don't realize you know but they're but they kept they've actually loved the one who wants to destroy them we're not mean to love the devil friends we're free I trust you're free I mean that when you walk into a place I mean it doesn't matter if you're accepted or rejected if the master of the house was called Beelzebub how much more the ones under him this message can never be made polished up to be palatable to the world it was never in the first you know Paul went to a certain city and and and the juicy term there you know what is this what is this this this GTO what is this cult of the sick that's risen up weren't spoken evil off everywhere they they weren't rejoicing you know the Jews and that they weren't rejoicing they weren't happy they want to hold on to their synagogue we'll keep our forum will keep our religion we'll keep our old ways what did their old ways do it didn't help them any but it was a tomb it was actually a tomb and here was the one who he was the one who came I'll take you out of the tomb amen when the when the when the when the when the stone was rolled away we you know we didn't read it but you read there I think it is a Matthew 28 the angel loved the sins and the stone rolls away and the guards fall as did men howl ouya and has to be the same thing for you you can't get out yourself you can plaster the inside of your tomb with all the nice nice quotes and nice things of you know around but unless God takes rolls a stone away but you've got to be willing to let it go you can't take your tomb with you doesn't matter how comfortable it is how how how nice interior maybe there's a lot of amazing tombs in the world you go look at the your the Pharaohs and all their things and there's incredible terms in the world I don't want to live in a tomb doesn't matter how nice it is how comfortable it may be I don't want to be weird if us I mean because when Jesus goes to a place I mean death has to flee because now there is life Alleluia so I trust you can rejoice with me if you've really been separated to the Lord you've come out you've heard a voice and something and you said I must go in spite of how you feel about it yeah you know when God moves we don't go by feeling I feel good so I'll follow I don't feel good so I won't it goes beyond how you feel because nothing wants to die do you think when when you go kill a lamb and you're gonna you're going to bribe the Slam do you think the Lambs going I'm so happy I can die it's not it's not trying to run towards where you gonna kill it it doesn't rejoice saying oh I'm so happy I can die today no wants to live it wants to live it doesn't want to die it doesn't want to give its life how much more a believer I don't want it nothing wants to die and this doesn't give you a happy feeling gives you you know what I mean but we don't you've got to go beyond how you feel because your term can feel good your term can feel nice I'm used to this place I don't know about what's out there in some sunlight it's all sealed up I know this atmosphere I'm used to this atmosphere it's a gloom of a tomb it's in darkness there's what we're born into but then the angel comes our trustees come to you and he's broken the seal and he's broken that seal of whatever the devil tried to seal you and Worth and all the Devils were scattered I mean that's why when the Gospels preached a war happens I mean because people come in doesn't matter you and the devil tries to attach himself to people whisper in your ear distract you make you think about all different kinds of things reasoning starts to go cast it off I mean cast it off I mean the preacher thing you know the Gospels mean to cast the devil away from a people that they can receive the promise I mean that's what's meant to happen there's a battle going on here friends you can be sitting as still as a stone what's going on in here you've got to accept it in here before it can be accepted in here and it's got to come through your reasoning and if your reasoning is now I'm going to hold on to my old life because I know what my old life was all about I'd get rid of that press the delete button get rid of it don't put it in the recycling bin cuz you can you can bring that back you got to delete it hallelujah you got to delete that thing now we're living in a resurrection hour I mean if you were we were once maybe I'll just put it up we're gonna jump we'll come back Ephesians 2 and 1 we are we have been resurrected this body hasn't been changed but we were actually born dead we had a life but it's not eternal life it's not eternal / it's very different eternal life and natural life two different two very different things so we're actually born dead oh you what do you mean I cried you're they make you know maybe gave me a speck I started crying and I breathed my first breath and now but eternally you didn't have life you'd have eternal life so that life that natural life will come to an end someday but we were once no he says and you now I pray I pray with everything within me I pray you can say this is me I haven't just become religious I haven't just become half a Christian half not a Christian but I've been quickened I'll be made alive I mean and when God brings a life he doesn't bring half a life I mean he brings a total life a full born babe not a partial birth a full birth hallelujah full birth amen and so when you had he quickened I mean I don't know if I have it here but he said the first Adam was a living soul but the second Adam was a quickening spirit a man and God is here that SiC and Adam Jesus Christ his Spurs here too quick and his word to his children I mean quicken them from death to life I mean what a Thanksgiving it should be hallelujah amen and you have a quickened I trust you say yes I have been quickened by the Spirit of God not because I think I have but my life is testimony that I've been quickened I'm in the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God it's not my own faith that's not my own life it is his faith and his faith is according to his word amen and I am now the living manifestation of his Bible I mean I trust you don't you don't choke on that statement but that's what the we are living epistles written on of all men not dead epistles I mean not just someone else's epistle you become a living epistle you become the interpretation of the word I'm when the prophecies were said about Jesus birth and then he was born and he lived his life was the interpretation and his birth was the interpretation of those prophecies I mean and you have to be able to look at yourself and look into the scripture and say my life is the interpretation the life I now live is the interpretation of the scripture amen it has to be we are we are these how do you know the Bible is true you should be able to see it in the people I mean when we talk about the good you know you're the fruits of the spirit that should be there it should be in your life I mean it if it's not on your life Wisla yeah if it's not manifested in your life do you have the life that produces the fruit amen you can't just patch it up Photoshop something to make it look and enhance it a little bit you got to have the life and if you don't have the life get the life takes a death I don't want to die you you jump on that altar you say God send you a fire and consume me wait until something happens what am I looking for I don't know but you got to die hallelujah and you had he quickened who once did you were once did who were dead in trespasses and sins where and in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience this is what you used to be I mean I'm no longer this person what a Thanksgiving this is my Thanksgiving I say Lord I want to give my Thanksgiving I mean I have so much that you know so much to be thankful for as once did I mean I was up to here and in partying I mean making homebrew sports movies music oh I was I was the living I was just that I was the typical drunk university student amen at the engine yeah and the engineering society which is far worse than the Victoria here also I was him that was me but then one day Jesus came I had to die I mean I remember studying for one of my exams such a strong conviction Kay God dealing with me such a strong conviction came over me I'm studying like organic chemistry and this conviction came upon me and the Lord said if you died without the Holy Ghost right now you'd be lost so I went home and I laid it all down I mean I didn't have to work out well do I have to do this too after this I just came to the point Lord take me put me on your wheel take everything this country of your word out of means that you can dwell in me I didn't work out what I had to give up and not give up and keeping whatever he did it Amen because we are not our own workmanship oh I'm just working through this no you got to give it to the one who can because good God's patient but his patience does run out but he's there in sight he done yet are you done yet I fail Lord help me he says ain't done yet o Lord I just can't overcome this ain't done you are you done you know come to the conclusion I'm done I can't do this hallelujah and he gives you overcoming power Amen if I lived in I seen this before I lived in a brewery I'd be sober if I lived in a computer game shop none of those games would get played a man if I lived in a music shop none of that music in there would be played hallelujah a man if I had you know you know what I mean and I don't have to keep myself yo now I can't and now I'm scared and how am I gonna survive the day no the desire wheat and he filled the desire there's not some big void I trusted you say what a Thanksgiving a many fills the void hallelujah with far greater things I don't want to play around with the devil's thinks what's it gonna give me it's gonna give me a burning lake of fire that's the reward I mean but with a reward of following Jesus Christ in this hour as is an eternal I mean there's an eternal reward I mean we've got to have we've got to value the reward because if you value the reward of what you shall receive I mean it it's worth it all I mean because work cuz labor without reward it becomes a burden I mean but if you could just see that eternal home I meant that were going to every battle every inch of the way will be worth it hallelujah Jesus saw the reward of going to the cross the joy that was set before him he saw that joy saw he redeemed he saw you gathered Rather's throne singing Hosanna and then he waited up he says it's worth it it's worth it it's worth being spit upon it's worth my bed being ripped out it's worth being scourged and rejected and dying with a broken heart hallelujah it is worth it because he despised you know he endured the cross despising the shame was the joy that was set before him was you redeemed you got to look at the gold we look at natural goals too much what about spiritual goals eternal goals because there'll come a time when there's no time and eternity is sitting where will you be where will you be you know I'm gonna be on streets of gold and I'm waiting oh yeah I'm waiting to hear one statement from his lips well done my good and faithful servant and he in the joys of the Lord I'm waiting for that voice when I stand before him well done doesn't mean good and successful good and faithful my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord I want to hear that and that should be our goal who wants to hear that voice who was the hereit said to you then you should lay aside every weight and every sin that so easily besets us I mean and run this race with patience hallelujah I want nothing to do with this world I want nothing to do with it spirit I want nothing to do with this culture I want nothing to do that's religion I want him I want to be separated to him all my heart soul mind and strength honor me for him it's worth it I wonder I want the greatest relationship with him that any man could ever have hallelujah I trust that should be our your ambition - I want to walk with Him like few have walked I mean I want a walk walk with them like Enoch hallelujah you know I would love it I would my brother bare him he had such a relationship with God he said he's there in the in the car with with brother bus go hunting he driving along and brother bicycle having and then brother bird I'm awesome you think this ministry could be there of melikhaya you know spoken Malachi and brother bustle said I believe it might yeah is so you see see that a beam came into the into the car and it was like here and brother Briscoe said my next breath I felt like it could take me to eternity he looked over at the Prophet he said look like he's a man is just about to die and he sees now this is brother brems would so I don't believe he's over exaggerating he sees now thousands times ten thousand times he's come to me and it's always the same no it's like I could just die it's a fearful thing but I would this is just me if God could come and visit me in that manner you know many times we sit in as blessings and it's incredible but that's even greater that's everything great of him to come down in that way now it's a fearful thing but to know there you'll be standing there you may feel like because we're not really built in these bodies as be in such an atmosphere but to be in that presence but knowing that there's no condemnation upon you I mean but is but but you're totally sealed away into his kingdom he took you and he washed you and he sanctified you amen and you're sealed away for eternity and in the very God who made all things just comes in they were driving along they weren't in church they were just driving along I was thinking Lord how wonderful would that be and then brother branham's there we all want to be in the prints of our God do we not isn't he the one we want to be in the presence off I mean that that is not just us walking along but he walks with us amen that he he takes us by the hand and he leads us don't isn't that what we want I mean but the only way we can really have that is now whole heart I mean I don't want to be an adulteress I mean I don't want to be guilty of adultery of living with the world living with the devil and trying to live with God at the same time I don't want to have two husbands I mean I've got one and he's in Lord Jesus Christ I mean because that old union was done away with not just hung up and put in the cupboard for another day win win win my walk with God I feels getting a bit bad I don't feel it's really working out I can turn to the old husband I mean I don't want to just hung up I want to do I mean that I cannot return to that old life hallelujah I trust you the same thing I don't want to go back to my old life I want to keep this life hallelujah I want to keep this life I mean brother brems in Colorado he's hunting there's a there's a on the on the on the radio they say a blizzards gonna come in brother man tells her tells Yvonne hunting now soon as the first snowflake falls you get back to camp as fast as you can and he's there the bullet just comes in and just in a few moments this was like a whiteout but he knows where he's going then he hears a voice behind him in the blizzard saying you know that now there's not word for word do they says I'm the Lord God Almighty will you walk with me wouldn't that be a imagine that here's the invitation would you walk with me this is all God wants Oh God wants his first children to walk with Him for his bride to walk with him I want to go for a walk with you yeah I mean this is what that's all he was for that's all he wants will you walk with me hey brother Bram staying in a blizzard he but he hears his voice he sees it'd be the greatest privilege just to walk with you now I would love that wouldn't you I'm not talking about the blizzard but just that voice what do you walk with me and you've actually got to understand he's asked you that he asks you that service after service every time you read the Bible every time you hit the message he's a saint will you walk with me that's all I want to do I want to walk with you haloo yeah and then there came a time in life where you said yes have you said yes I trust you've said yes and then now you oughta told me hear a voice will you walk with me yes then the angel comes down the stone rolls away then you step out helllooo you step out and you're a whole different atmosphere you see the world totally different hallelujah but you hear the voice Here I am Here I am Lord hallelujah we'd be made of life we don't walk according to the Prince of the power of the ear I trust you do not anymore what does this message seem to do take a bride take a people who are not my people and they become my people and I will be their God and I'll take them and I'll lift them up out of slavery above the works of the enemy and I'll wash them and I'll cleanse them and I'll and I'll transform them that the devil has no claim upon these ones anymore hallelujah when when the hundred and twenty were in the upper room I mean the devil still had claims on them before the Holy Ghost came he said like claims I mean he could say the woman at the well was living in adultery Peter tried to kill a guy yeah there was I know all different ones Mira Magdalene had Seven Devils cast out of her they were all born in a perverted way they were born in a fallen state that's his claim remember many times we think oh I've never been bad you know I'm a good person I've been raised in church but you'll born the wrong way that's why he must be born again so it's not how good you know someone someone who sits on a pews never had a real experience with God and someone who's a serial killer or some some Islamic extremists that goes and blows himself up and you know kills a whole bunch of people they're on the same category because they're both lost but humanly we have to say well this one's worse than this what no we're all in the same category we're all born lost but this one standing and who can you who can change you from being lost to being found hallelujah and then and then so the devil has claims on them I I be called their first yo even though I made Adam fall and now they're all bought a fallin way the devil their claims on them then the Holy Ghost comes the one who was in flesh hallelujah who walked with him we're going to have more than God walking with us he's got to be in us that's how he can really walk with us if he's in us the Holy Ghost comes because now what did Jesus do he comes into his ministry he starts laying claim on people Peter James and John follow me woman at the well follow me hallelujah Legion come follow me Matthew the text think they'll follow me he's laying claim Satan these are mine these are mine I'm putting my hands upon their they're going to follow me they're my property they're going to walk with me he's laying claims hallelujah and when the and when God lays claim on a person good luck devil you're going to need it because you won't be able to succeed I mean there may be a battle raging I mean probably know who's going to win I mean we know who has the victory our Lord Jesus has the victory hallelujah so he lays claim a men and he gathers his disciples bury Martha Lazarus all the different ones hallelujah didn't in there in the upper room then the Holy Ghost comes down I mean and the Holy Ghost the abstract comes down I mean seals them into the kingdom and God is testifying these ones have nothing the devil has no hold upon these ones anymore they belong to me I've I've redeemed them I've forgiven them of present past and future soon I mean there's nothing that can be held against them hallelujah I have laid claim and not just not just actually that belongs to me he goes and grabs them hallelujah embraces them towards bosom I mean these are my ones hallelujah that's the same thing with you I trust I mean if you have the Holy Ghost this morning the devil has no hold up on you he has no claim on your life I mean that's why the bride can leave this world I mean because there's none of the shackles of the devil religious or otherwise that can hold their earthbound Amen but we've been we've been totally set free what a Thanksgiving I mean we're totally set free hallelujah and you got to say yes that's me yes I agree yes I receive it hallelujah that's why they'll come a time come up and before you realize hallelujah you're before you realize this body will be changed the dead in Christ will be be here and yea I'm fully expecting one day a brother by the name was names Andrew but they call them blue cuz he has redheaded brother blue Kennedy I remember him saying to me one day we're talking in the foyer gospel way he says the scriptures are so rich and I'm expecting a redhead at about 18 to 21 year old man one day walk through the door I don't know where I'll be I'm not worried where I'll be but one day I expect this one and I won't recognize him at first me I say the Scriptures really remember when we said the scriptures are so rich hello there yeah and then I'll know it's on you say well I've never I've never known a saint that's gone on they'll make sure you know who they are they'll make sure they'll make sure that you are recognizing what's going on Alleluia no we're gonna we're gonna he says here now where are we verse this three among whom also you all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh does it feel good yes does not feel good I won't do it that's the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the might of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others they've got to understand if God is in you you have overcoming power over your own self you have overcoming power over your own self hallelujah so because God is in you our trustees in you then he is greater than the desires of the flesh and of the mind and he will make it subject to his own word amen you yeah that's like a most yogi you take like the world straw this man and he comes and he picks me up I I can I don't think I could even struck he just pinned me now you're going here when God comes yes what I'll do whatever you want to do because I love you hallelujah I'm glad but God who's Richard mercy amen but God was Richard mercy for his great lover and he loved us I mean you say God's never done anything for me yes he did Amen he's already shown his love for you I mean I've never seen a miracle I've never seen a healing he's never spoken to me what yeah he doesn't really love me no you need to go read the Bible hallelujah why did he send you Elijah the Prophet before the Great and dreadful day of the Lord behold us in you who's you me he sent me Elijah the Prophet Amen that I'll be ready to go meet the Lord in the air he's done a lot for you hallelujah remember if Jesus only came and died for you and Elijah was seen only for you God would do it all the same he's here now even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together in Christ by grace ye are saved in us raised us up together and made us sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus this is the believers position in Christ this is where you are this is where you are don't take it casual I mean don't yo it's like anything just say if I go move to it a bit it'll take me a while to acclimatize to the atmosphere but eventually my body will eventually it will and I'll get used to it because now because my body has caught up with where I am now it's the same thing with us you meet God it's incredible incredible it's even greater but he does something like he heals units the greatest thing in the world and he comes down and you can barely believe it the Spirit of God is here I'm in the the same God in the Bible that I read about I see them do the same things and it's amazing and it's incredible but then you begin to get used to it not in a bad way but then you actually begin to realize this is how God works this is what he does why because you've become acclimatized to the new atmosphere you live in and then you try and go back into the old atmosphere you know is that meant I was a bit of a bit of a nerd but probably still am I used to play this little game where you make armies out of little models yeah yeah that thing anyway so I was obsessed with this thing and sir it's anyway this isn't my team anyway I meet the Lord and then I actually one time I think I was visiting Christine and I had to go print off my ticket for the plane and there's a a what'd he call it an internet cafe and it also sold this stuff so I went into this place and I just I wasn't looking at it well I just I just did a lap around the aisles where it was just walk through and I felt such an evil I used to love that atmosphere but I got acclimatize to another atmosphere and I didn't want to go back to that atmosphere hallelujah I'm so glad it's true so it's the same thing that's why we go to places that we used to love that's like me I just saw him comfortable in this place I feel like a you know I just feel like a fish out of water or whatever saying you want to put it - it's because you now climatized to a different atmosphere and he did it amen no full by then in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus for by grace you're saved through faith and not of yourselves it is a gift of God now I've said this many times but this is the definition of new grace in the New Testament now I'm not going to try and say it in Greek but um this is so this is this word grace here and you'll find it in the New Testament virtually in every place this is the definition graciousness is gratifying of manner or act concrete literal friggin total spiritual especially there's a straight from the Strong's Concordance especially the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life this is do you know grace do you know grace I mean because this is what grace really is the divine influence upon that especially now I don't add anyway I just copy pasted this especially the divine influence upon the heart and its reflection in the life grace is not God saying I'll turn a blind eye to your sin that is not grace that is not grace the world has turned God into an old dirty granddad who just lets us kids do whatever what because that's more palatable and also because they preach a gospel that could not free the people from their sins that's why they say well how can we how can we still keep people will change the gospel to say just come as you are stay as you are that's what Jesus said go he he set the people free says go and sin no more leads to worse and come upon you that's what he said go and sin no more and the thing is this is what Calvary has done that he would send a divine influence this is my Thanksgiving a divine influence upon my heart and it's reflection the life now your life should be the interpretation of this definition hallelujah I trusted us I trust you can say I am a living manifestation of grace amen because once upon a time it was the devil's influence upon my heart and it and his reflection in my life but then grace came I mean grace came took away that old husband I mean the first husband had to die I mean they'll be united to another Paul speaks about it in Romans hallelujah and now the read so I'm now married to mr. grace his name's Jesus Christ and that's reflected and because I'm mrs. grace this is reflected in my life hallelujah and its reflection in the life hallelujah now he sees here I trust that's you you say well I don't think it's me you go to him and die we don't have to polish it up as I preach they just go you must die you got to die with your enemy like Samson he died in the temple and he killed mourners death and in his life so all of them because what happens is your tomb because the temple is a tomb a temple is a tomb we were sitting we're listening to an orchestra and one of the basilica's basilica's in central wellington very amazing music but we're sitting there are there's a Catholic one and it's a basilica a Basilica has it did bishop in it so I'm thinking I'm sitting in some guys grew it to his grave listening to music this is weird but no one thinks of it that way because it's just tradition this is what we do we bury people who make a big a big church is just a tomb and people go into the tomb I was thinking maybe I should really be listening to heavy metal in here be more appropriate or death metal or something anyway so I don't know how I got onto that one but you know we at tomb not of works at least any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so I just came back to me Sampson was in the temple of Dagon in a temple now a temple has idols man-made those idols then man put your Samson into that temple now we can turn our to because the temple has got what demon power in it it's deaf it's deaf so I can say it's a 2 and we can garnish out with idols it can be our our pain it can be our unforgiveness it can be our resentment it can be our bitterness and we can carve this most elaborate thing out of it do you know what this person did to me I don't have a chisel and this happened and why did I have this kind of birth my family this way why and then BOOM and Lord I want to be free and people worshiping it well and people say you know and what well how do you get rid of that thing you guys stand there you find where the pillars of the house are paddy how do you push it down you got to die Samson was willing to die with his enemy I remember now our past and things that happen in our past can be our biggest enemy I mean they can be our biggest enemy how do I defeat this enemy in my life because remember our past has mold us a certain way the reason you are the way you are today is because of something happened to you in the past either your parents did something or someone you know how they raised you has molded you a certain way and your in your society wherever you came from things in life good and bad they've molded you and you say well how do I overcome this you got to push it down you have to die if you know if Samson wasn't willing to die he would never push down the temple a man and he killed more in his death and in his life who wants to kill some Devils he wants to kill some Devils well how do I kill the devil in my life push down that you got to die you got to die with your enemy I trust that's not too crude you got to be willing to die now I'm sorry about I just like the scripture that's why we I don't know the timers but where I'm I think it's helped us living she's eight thirty on my tablet anyway well anytime we're here early hallelujah I think I'm still in Papua New Guinea out of that anyway so we're off I'm sorry about this so there in times past you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus you who are sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace he is our peace amen if you need some peace he is our peace I mean who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace hallelujah I've got peace with my god I pray you do too now I want to go into this because I said life eternal life is different to natural life now this is speaking of Jesus made as a priest after the order of Melchizedek and I want to take this this here who has made not after the law of carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life after the power of an endless life he is our high priest now Jesus the life that was in him is now in the believer hallelujah so now he was he was now he is now living by the power of an endless life a life that cannot end and a power is a force they meant a powers of force I mean so he's not living he wasn't living just by his own his own human life amen if you have met God you don't live by the power of your natural life I meant because your natural life will come to an end if the world turns a few more times just in a few decades you know most of us won't be here we go 50 years he'll still be here I might not be here I might well I'll be 82 I might not be here for 50 years is not that long I was just heading the middle of the bell-shaped curve of the age distribution of the church you know anyway but we 50 is not long but might even be included I might just be a you know in a box six feet underground someplace and you and you maybe say oh you remember brother Ben yes and whatever and you know it just be a memory 50 years is not long that's if I live after the power of just human life human life is under the subject of Satan I mean it has no dominion it as it is the it is a slave but our Lord Jesus has made he wasn't made after the kernel this is that this is the priesthood but after the power of an endless life hallelujah now we the believer we have this power we are made just just just pull a little bit more I'm nearly done I know it's hot in here but we're but we are made after the power of an endless life now a power as I see it as a it's it's it's a power by implication and miracle itself ability abundance it's many different things it's a force a meter now now when Jesus came upon the earth I'd say the power or the force of God and him was manifested in flesh and every enemy had to battle that force I mean because it's like in physics is the greater than sign hallelujah and the less then can ever overcome the greater then hallelujah and the power of God is always greater than the devil I mean it yo every demon could line up and try and stop the rapture and they would fail everyone I mean every demon Amy could line up and try and stop you coming forth and they would fail everyone hallelujah program said about the boy in Finland he said now you know because he had the vision two years before and he finds himself in that scene and he said now every difficult line up and try and stop that boy coming back to life and God would raise him from the dead hallelujah that's the kind of confidence we've got a heaven our God amen that every demon could line up amen and stop you every day and that fall every day hallelujah because we have a power of our endless life you mean me little old me yes little old you as I said about xem guy he wasn't strong he wasn't a military man he didn't have a bunch of worries to fight with him he just had Knox goes he saw the need of his family he went after those Philistines and they died everyone holy cuz he was standing in his position in his Lane and it's the same thing with us he probably wasn't feeling he probably woke up like any other kind of day I'm hungry I've just harvested this and he's living in fear he's living in fear because he knows the Philistines will come in and get his grain again he's living in fear he didn't wake up and say glory hallelujah we're some Philistines I'm gonna go kill them with Marx god I'm a son of Abraham hallelujah to God he wasn't that kind of person he was just living life living in fear Allu you then the enemy came on his land I mean and that enemy had to die and the enemy died and Shem and Shem guy was staying there without a scratch hallelujah whole bunch of yeah a whole bunch of Philistines did around him I mean there was a power there wasn't just a natural human ability hallelujah brother Brahim says he recognized here's the son of Abraham and that was enough I mean that was enough eca that's what the Prophet told us it's the same thing with us you've got to recognize I've come under a covenant with God amen and that covenant is I'll make them into my image they'll be like me the devil would not be able to hold anything against them they'll be washed in my blood they'll be as righteous as I'm righteous they'll be sinless as I'm sinless hallelujah they'll be made in my image I will do this I mean you're recognized I've come under that covenant holy as it doesn't matter and that's enough I mean that's enough is it not that's enough hallelujah so so that is enough then every devil must go I mean all dad must go don't look at you look at him look at his word look at his promise hello Lee and Noah looked 120 years of the promises going to rain I mean build this boat like I told you and he got his family focused in this is the promise God spoke to me hey sure dad God people say God speaks to all these different people yes he spoke to me I mean I found grace in his sight Oh glory Gracie sitting inside a many keep this family focused we're gonna build this boat we're gonna build the sock I mean we're gonna layer it and side out with pitch it's gonna be this certain let's labor do you think they had a rejoicing time for 120 years they weren't rejoicing sometimes they woke up oh okay this big mighty tree cut it down it's work but they had an end goal in mind they kept the vision in front of them they kept the ingo the end goal was we're gonna get into this thing God will bring the animals and then there's gonna be water come dad has never rained before how's this gonna happen God said I've never seen rain daddy sure the scientists I read the New Scientist magazine and it said no it's never rained and we can now rest assured the way of a theory it cannot rain that's what they said about cosmology they said we now have a theory there's a few years ago I read and you signed this magazine we can now rest easy I wish I took a photo of it we can now rest easy because we have a theory for cosmology that takes away any need for a creator yeah because science is not looking for the Creator because they would have hundred years ago they should have come to the conclusion God made this I'm not the top of the food chain what's happening Lord hey sure it's gonna rain yeah God said is this worth it dead yes it's gonna rain kept them focused on the vision I mean they'll come a time when a sweep is gonna come I tell you friends the power to take us from this earth of Nyx is already here I mean the powers being released through this entire message I mean to take us from this world to the next world I mean if you have the Holy Ghost you have the creative power in you I mean to transform this body you're carrying it with you back as I saw legs that I've got a headache you know and things are not going so well you're carrying that with you and workers yo you having a hard day at work and whatever more you carry that with you hallelujah you got to look at you gotta say what is what has happened to me what has happened to me you really gotta look back I think what well I was once a slave to sin I'm not that person anymore and he called me out here amen of my sins all gone I've been washed I'll be made a new creation oh and the Holy Ghost came into me and I see his life living out of me and my nature has been changed the person I once was I had a temple like a buzz saw and I and animals on fully automatic and the batteries never ran out and I ran it everyone I could hallelujah amen but now I don't well who did that and I had so much resentment on me I couldn't forgive anyone and now I just get on my knees I pray for them more than I pray for my own soul who did that amen the Lord did that so you got about your to recognize now the power to take me to heaven is in here and I carry it with me every day even when I have a bad back and I feel bad and I feel down and I'm not happy and I'm not rejoicing and yeah it doesn't it doesn't come in and out you can grieve him but he doesn't leave you you can't grieve him you can't grieve you know the Holy Ghost will buy your seal to the day of your Redemption you can grieve God absolutely that doesn't mean but that doesn't mean he leaves you I mean you just got to repent and then you'll come back again they never leaves leaves you if you know if you understand now it's a force endless that means in dissolvable that is permanent that's eternal life it's permanent it's not dissolvable amen it doesn't change natural life as I said one day we'll be dead but this life this endless life it's permanent this is how this is how he's made a priest after the order of melchizedek by the power of an endless life hallelujah and this is now this is how we friends now this is not just positive spanking a positive speaking people really do meet God people God really does dwell in human people he really does he really does transform he really does free from sin he read us change habits a many changes outlooks he changes how people speak he changes ambitions and everything he really does it I mean it's not all nice and yes and we're all Christians and everything's fine no good no he give us a power to live above to live above our old life in this world hallelujah he really does do it what a Thanksgiving amen amen no he sees this here hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people as the wave sheaf he's talking about for the first time it came forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word waved back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there even as the ministry brother branham the same things that happened back there happened in this day and the same life that was back there that's why we can go into the book of Acts we can see the Ministry of the Holy Ghost through the Apostles and we can see the book of Acts is living in today hallelujah and that same God that was back there with Timothy and all the different brethren back there and Dorcas and whoever more you know you know the brothers and sisters in Christ we see that same life as here they've been that same life that same quickening they were quickened I mean that quickening spirit made the word of life to them hallelujah and he's done the same thing with us I mean what a Thanksgiving and we'll be made alive in Christ hallelujah I'm not just trying to excite you I trust this means something to you I'm not dead I'm alive I've come out of the tomb Connelly I've been resurrected amen and death can't hug me I'm in devil just do me a favor because I want to be where he is I mean that's why we have church or we preach and we have fellowship and and we want to see Souls come in because when the last one comes and we're out hallelujah and if I die or I see that did in Christ rise I win anyway amen I'm fully persuaded friends I don't know about you I trust you're fully persuaded about this message I'm in full power being waved over the people same signs and wonders he did there and he says because I live Jesus said these words because I live ye live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power police is because I live you shall live also amen he resurrected out of the tomb amen to live eternally hallelujah he sends for the Spirit is declaring amen because I live you shall live also a season that day in this day and it's gotta be personal to you and that that ye shall know that I am in the father and the father and me and I and you and you and me hallelujah you've got a note it's it is in that day when the Holy Ghost comes unto you you'll know that amen what a Thanksgiving because I love you love also speaking to his wife and when God says something it has to happen amen we're being a made of life he said this is awfully kind of simple it means a lot to me I'm not dead this this goes beyond an intellectual debate and I think and you think it know what's the state of your being he was waved to them the word which he was was way back there and their Pentecost the word made manifest now and as I say it's to be waved II in the last days and it has waved again what a Thanksgiving God's come down he showed himself to us he says you see this this is me this is me and I do this to draw you know I'm I'm gonna close with this statement he he did this all that you would recognize because I live you shall live also you see this eternal life has been manifested and you behold it hallelujah and something in you says that's me this is my true identity this is where I belong something in you says that you don't understand it was something and he says father is that you my bridegroom is that you halleluyah telekinesis I know that's you I mean something he says I want to go where you are
