[4:20] they were
[4:21] leaving egypt and exodus 33
[4:25] 14 god said to moses he said my presence
[4:29] shall go with thee and i will give thee
[4:31] rest
[4:32] and then moses said
[4:36] if thy presence go not with me carry us
[4:39] not up hence
[4:42] and i think that's our prayer you know
[4:44] we
[4:46] like moses said lord if you're not going
[4:47] to come with us just leave us here you
[4:49] know i don't want to go

[4:52] without the presence of god being with
[4:54] us
[4:55] if thy presence go not whether with me
[4:58] carry us not up hence
[5:00] and we just want to invite the presence
[5:03] of the lord with us this morning
[5:05] because we want the presence of the lord
[5:06] to carry us hence you know to move us
[5:08] forward
[5:09] we want his mind and his desires and
[5:11] everything that he wants to
[5:12] be manifest in our midst this morning so

[5:42] be with us this morning
[5:43] lord to to move us forward lord as that
[5:46] pillar of fire was there in the
[5:48] wilderness
[5:48] in the tabernacle in the wilderness lord
[5:50] if it was if it stayed there the people
[5:52] stayed but when it started to move then
[5:54] the people were moved
[5:55] lord may that be our experience lord may
[5:57] we just go with you lord as we see you
[5:59] moving in a direction we just follow you
[6:02] lord because you know the way through
[6:05] the wilderness
[6:06] lord you know the way through every
[6:08] every situation in our life
[6:10] you know the perfect way lord we don't
[6:12] want to think that we know the way lord
[6:14] but we want to surrender to you
[6:15] lord as brother adam said he would pray
[6:17] in the morning because he realized that
[6:18] life was too complicated
[6:20] for him he just wanted to be led by you
[6:22] daily
[6:23] lord so we just desire that this morning
[6:25] we ask that you'll um
[6:26] bless our service may come and meet with
[6:28] us lord bless the songs bless the
[6:30] ministry
[6:31] and bless our attitude may our attitude
[6:35] make you feel welcome lord and our our
[6:38] thoughts
[6:39] our mind our desire lord we know that
[6:42] you don't just
[6:43] you don't you see more than just the way
[6:45] we look lord but you see what our heart
[6:47] is like lord and that's what you respond
[6:48] to so
[6:49] may our heart be open may it be
[6:52] uncritical may
[6:53] desire to draw you into our midst
[6:56] may it be full of love for each other
[6:59] for you
[7:00] lord may there not be anything that
[7:01] would hinder us um this morning
[7:04] lord say we just thank you that we can
[7:05] come to you and you said we're two or
[7:07] three gathered together in your name
[7:08] there you are in the midst
[7:10] so we just um thank you for that lord
[7:12] and i just want to commit the service to
[7:13] you in jesus name
[7:14] amen amen praise the lord
[7:21] there's not one person in this world
[7:23] that i don't like
[7:25] i was just praying last night and i
[7:27] thought lord i have
[7:29] i just love everybody in the whole wide
[7:31] world i can't
[7:33] you know like when you realize the grace
[7:37] of god that's given to us
[7:38] to me how could you
[7:42] have any sort of true animosity i mean
[7:45] sometimes you get
[7:46] you know frustrated with so-and-so on
[7:47] this particular occasion because of this
[7:49] it's not really talking about that you
[7:50] know that's just the situation but
[7:52] but actual animosity or any negative
[7:54] feeling in your heart towards anyone
[7:57] that that just tears them down and i
[7:59] think lord your grace has built me up
[8:01] how could i have a little spot of any of
[8:03] that in me anywhere for anyone to tear
[8:05] someone down
[8:06] when i've been lifted up from the grace
[8:08] of god
[8:09] you know the bible says he has been
[8:10] forgiven much loveth much
[8:13] and it felt nice in prayer to know to
[8:16] say lord i
[8:16] actually don't have anything in my heart
[8:18] towards anybody ever anyone that's done
[8:20] anything towards me
[8:22] whatever amen you know it's a it's a
[8:26] peaceful feeling
[8:27] amen and that's that's you know when we
[8:29] get in that atmosphere that's where the
[8:30] spirit of god is you know
[8:31] that's where god dwells in in that type
[8:33] of atmosphere so let's
[8:35] let's get in that atmosphere this

[35:42] forth the same night peter was sleeping
[35:44] between two soldiers bound with
[35:46] two chains and the keepers before the
[35:48] door kept the prison
[35:50] and behold the angel lord came upon him
[35:53] and a light
[35:53] shot shined in the prison and he smote
[35:56] peter on the side and raised him up
[35:57] saying arise up quickly
[35:59] and his chains fell off from his hands
[36:01] and the angel said unto him gird thyself
[36:03] and bind on thy sandals
[36:05] and so he did and he saith unto him cast
[36:07] like garment about thee and follow me
[36:09] and he went out and followed him and was
[36:11] not that it was a
[36:12] that it was true which was done by the
[36:14] angel but he thought he saw a vision
[36:17] when he uh they were past the first and
[36:19] second ward they came unto the iron gate
[36:21] that leadeth unto the city which opened
[36:24] to them of
[36:25] his own accord and they went out and
[36:26] passed on through one street
[36:28] and wherewith the angel departed from
[36:32] him
[36:33] and when peter was gone out sorry and
[36:35] when peter was come to himself he said
[36:38] now i know of a shortie that the lord
[36:40] has sent his angel and has delivered me
[36:43] out of the hand of herod
[36:44] and from all the expectation of the
[36:47] people

[38:52] um yes i did actually on friday i had
[38:55] flowers
[38:55] seemed to brother gary on all of your
[38:56] behalf so i trust he will receive them
[39:00] amen um so i want to talk about here i
[39:02] want to continue on from um
[39:04] wednesday uh in a way but you know we
[39:07] live in an hour
[39:09] where well actually every believer has
[39:11] had a decision in life
[39:13] what are they going to do about it when
[39:14] the devil comes to their address
[39:16] are they just going to let them come in
[39:18] and say well i just it's predestinated
[39:20] and you know
[39:21] but brother brown tells us that god
[39:23] doesn't just force us through a pipe and
[39:25] make us overcome
[39:26] we have a part to play we have a human
[39:29] will that we've got to
[39:30] either fight the enemy or not fight the
[39:33] enemy
[39:34] you know brother brown says in many uh
[39:36] you know in quite a few places
[39:38] he he poses the question what are you
[39:41] going to do about it
[39:44] he says here now this is why i probably
[39:46] should just print out things because i
[39:47] can go from page
[39:48] last one to the first one but he asked
[39:52] the question
[39:54] if i can find it he says it's like you
[39:56] know the revival just kind of dries up a
[39:58] bit
[39:59] and then he and he says what are you
[40:01] going to do about it are you going to go
[40:02] into organization or not
[40:04] so we're going to just organize and have
[40:05] our systems all set up and everything
[40:07] but
[40:07] we're going to let god live you know
[40:09] sickness strikes what are you going to
[40:10] do about it
[40:11] hardship comes what are you going to do
[40:13] about it trouble rises up what are you
[40:15] going to do
[40:16] amen because you know we're believers
[40:19] today
[40:20] aren't we we've been trained to fight
[40:22] this is
[40:23] this is a battlefield i'm glad you know
[40:26] well wouldn't you like a sunday school
[40:28] picnic for a kind of a life
[40:29] well yes or no because it's only those
[40:33] who really
[40:34] step onto the battlefield it's not the
[40:36] armchair critic
[40:37] that'll get any praise or anything you
[40:39] know it's those who really press the
[40:41] battle
[40:42] they may fail brother brahm said i'd
[40:43] rather be on the field
[40:45] trying to save souls and make a failure
[40:48] but what are you doing about it
[40:50] you know so here we are satan has a will
[40:54] well together satan has a will he he he
[40:57] was desiring to destroy peter
[41:00] he wanted to destroy him not only there
[41:04] where jesus says that satan has desired
[41:06] to have you to sift you as wheat
[41:08] but i have prayed for you that your
[41:09] faith will not fail so jesus was
[41:11] interceding for one of his apostles
[41:13] because he knew the job that peter had
[41:15] to do he had the keys to the kingdom he
[41:17] had to put it in the lock and open the
[41:18] door
[41:19] to the jews the gentiles and the
[41:20] samaritans all the same way acts 2 38
[41:23] amen repent and be baptized everyone in
[41:25] the name of the lord jesus christ for
[41:27] the remission of sin you shall receive
[41:28] the gift of the holy ghost that was the
[41:30] keys being
[41:30] put in the door to open it that the
[41:32] people could come into the
[41:34] kingdom of god so he had a job to do
[41:37] and satan was trying to take him before
[41:40] he fulfilled his job hallelujah but then
[41:44] jesus said i have prayed for thee that
[41:46] when satan comes to sift you that your
[41:47] faith
[41:48] would not fail and we have the same kind
[41:50] of situation where
[41:52] where peter said well you know god has
[41:54] delivered him
[41:55] out of the hand of herod and from all
[41:57] the expectation of the people of the
[41:59] jews but really it was the devil's
[42:01] expectation
[42:02] i'm going to kill this guy i'm going to
[42:03] kill this believer i'm going to cut his
[42:05] head off in the morning
[42:06] this was his expectation so it was
[42:07] really the devil's expectation
[42:09] being manifested through a people but
[42:11] you know you know but what would have
[42:13] happened
[42:14] if the church just said well i guess
[42:16] he'll just be like james
[42:18] he was a good brother and they began to
[42:19] have a memorial service before he even
[42:21] died
[42:22] but they weren't those kind of believers
[42:24] they prayed without ceasing
[42:26] that god would intercede hallelujah and
[42:29] god begin to act you know you think
[42:31] about how impossible the situation is to
[42:33] get out
[42:34] you know he's chained between two guards
[42:36] within the inner prison
[42:37] and then the angel comes in and a light
[42:39] shone in the prison why didn't the light
[42:41] shine on it
[42:42] wake up anyone else well it wasn't for
[42:43] them it was for peter
[42:45] hallelujah but that was now it was the
[42:47] church's expectation that god can
[42:49] deliver because he's the god of
[42:50] deliverance
[42:51] against the expectation of the devil
[42:53] through the jews that he's gonna die
[42:55] and one expectation one right
[42:59] we're here to fight we're not here just
[43:01] to take it we're here to give it back
[43:03] and more and them some hallelujah
[43:06] yeah because we are a people that are
[43:09] kings and priests unto our god
[43:12] hallelujah so i want to go i'm going to
[43:14] read some scriptures here then we'll get
[43:15] into it so
[43:16] we read here in ephesians 2 and 1 and
[43:18] you hathy quickened
[43:20] who are dead in trespasses and sins
[43:22] where in times past you
[43:24] you walked according to the course of
[43:26] this world according to the prince of
[43:27] the power of the air
[43:28] the spirit that now worketh and the
[43:30] children of disobedience
[43:32] among whom also we all had our
[43:34] conversation in times past
[43:36] and the lusts of our flesh fulfilling
[43:37] the desires of deflation of the mind and
[43:40] we're by nature the children of wrath
[43:42] even as others
[43:43] but god who's rich in mercy for his
[43:45] great lover and he loved us
[43:46] even when we're dead in sins hath
[43:48] quickened us together with christ
[43:50] by grace he has saved and has raised us
[43:52] up together and made us sit together in
[43:54] heaven
[43:54] heavenly places in christ jesus that in
[43:57] the ages to come he might show the
[43:58] exceeding riches of his grace and his
[44:00] kindness
[44:01] towards us through christ jesus so as
[44:04] we're talking about on wednesday
[44:05] we have the bride has been elevated to a
[44:08] position in heavenly places in christ
[44:10] jesus now
[44:11] this position is our position in christ
[44:13] as adam
[44:14] was in this position before the fall and
[44:16] he could tell nature to move he had
[44:18] dominion over the earth
[44:19] but because of sin he forfeited that he
[44:22] he he fell from his position
[44:24] and now man has been under the bondage
[44:26] of satan
[44:27] and death until now or until calvary
[44:30] where people could actually be elevated
[44:32] back to that position that adam fell
[44:34] from and the prophet tells us that we
[44:36] have received now
[44:38] everything that adam lost eternal life
[44:40] hallelujah
[44:41] and that eternal life is not just a not
[44:44] just a um what do you call it a
[44:46] consolation when a believer passes on
[44:47] well we'll see them again no
[44:49] that eternal life is actually to have
[44:50] dominion over the earth because it's
[44:51] god's own life
[44:53] hallelujah so that's the position we are
[44:55] to be seated together in heavenly places
[44:57] in christ jesus
[44:59] and we the apostle paul tells us that
[45:01] god places us then
[45:02] you know there's a big difference
[45:04] between professing and possessing
[45:06] proof there's a big difference between
[45:08] just confessing a promise or professing
[45:10] a promise
[45:11] to actually possessing that promise we
[45:13] want to be possessors of the promise
[45:15] today
[45:16] we don't just want to talk about it sure
[45:17] we should talk about it right because
[45:19] they overcame him by the blood lamb and
[45:20] the word of their testimony
[45:22] but it's not just to profess it but it's
[45:24] to possess it
[45:26] hallelujah so here we are now there's
[45:27] actually a people upon the earth
[45:29] that don't just talk about being the
[45:31] bride of christ made one with christ
[45:32] they are
[45:34] right but now it's time for us to
[45:35] exercise our god-given authority
[45:38] amen here we are because you know
[45:40] christianity isn't just to be talked
[45:42] about it's to be lived
[45:43] it's to be manifested the apostle paul
[45:45] said the gospel did not come to you just
[45:47] in words only but empowering
[45:48] demonstration of the holy ghost
[45:50] amen and we're living in an hour where
[45:52] people don't just talk about it but it's
[45:54] a demonstration
[45:56] amen with the dynamics of the holy ghost
[45:58] of coming to the church once again
[46:00] hallelujah amen this is where we are but
[46:03] yeah we have a powerful position
[46:05] amen that we are inhabiting now the
[46:08] devil has been squatting in this
[46:10] position and you got to kick him out
[46:12] right that's like just like the just
[46:14] like the israelites you know there were
[46:15] there were enemies
[46:16] all over their inheritance all over
[46:18] their promise all over their god
[46:19] ordained position
[46:21] you know when the when the patriarchs
[46:22] were birthed the hebrew mothers would
[46:24] would speak their name
[46:26] and that was prophetically saying like
[46:27] benjamin or or ruben or naphtali or
[46:30] asher or gad you know that that name was
[46:33] associated with a certain position in
[46:35] the promised land
[46:36] so they were actually prophesying this
[46:38] is where these people will eventually
[46:40] end up
[46:41] hallelujah so it's the same thing when
[46:43] we're birthed into the kingdom there's a
[46:45] word there's a name
[46:46] a bride this is jesus christ
[46:49] holy and that's prophesying now where
[46:52] you will end up
[46:53] but i tell you do you want to get there
[46:55] you know
[46:56] i say if if if we have been
[46:58] predestinated by foreknowledge god could
[47:01] look see god didn't say well
[47:02] i'll save one and not lose one but
[47:04] because he could look through time by
[47:06] foreign say
[47:07] that one will be saved that one won't
[47:09] because he can see the end from the
[47:10] beginning now
[47:11] if god saw me that i'd be predestined to
[47:13] be an overcomer i'm going to live that
[47:16] if he saw me by foreknowledge that i'm
[47:18] going to be a serpent bruiser in this
[47:19] hour
[47:20] i said lord be beat unto me according to
[47:22] thy word
[47:23] i'm going to be a serpent bruiser see it
[47:25] depends really what you believe you are
[47:28] amen you know just like brother brown
[47:31] would tell the story of the
[47:32] son of the king of the african tribe he
[47:34] was now a slave in america but he
[47:35] conducted himself differently
[47:37] i mean to the rest of the slaves because
[47:38] he's the son of a king though he will
[47:41] probably never go back and take his
[47:42] throne of his father back in the
[47:44] homeland
[47:44] he conducted himself as a son of a king
[47:47] and brother ram says we
[47:48] as sons and daughters of god should
[47:50] conduct ourselves like sons and
[47:52] daughters of god
[47:53] he maybe never saw that throne i don't
[47:55] know he may not remember even where it
[47:57] was in africa but he had a revelation
[48:00] i am the son of a king hallelujah and
[48:02] you know we were in god's mind we don't
[48:04] remember being there there's not
[48:05] pre-existence of souls like the mormons
[48:07] would preach but
[48:08] you know i trust there's something's
[48:09] anchored in your heart i'm a son or
[48:11] daughter of god
[48:12] i want to conduct myself as a son and
[48:14] daughter of god
[48:15] hallelujah amen so now this is the so as
[48:20] the israelites went and remember
[48:21] god told them i've given you the land
[48:23] but they had to go fight
[48:25] they had to put the armor on they had to
[48:26] pick up their shield their sword their
[48:28] helmet whatever equipment they had
[48:29] they had to go fight the battle
[48:31] hallelujah just like you know this
[48:33] i think brother andy showed us when he
[48:35] came back from the holy land that time
[48:36] he said there's some jews that are
[48:38] literally overnight they'll set up a
[48:39] settlement
[48:40] put up a guard tower you know because
[48:43] they're possessing their land they
[48:44] believe
[48:44] they believe it's theirs that they're
[48:46] actively putting works
[48:48] into their faith right so they're not
[48:50] just talking about this is our land
[48:52] they're possessing their land
[48:53] right but there's some jews they are not
[48:56] interested in taking their land because
[48:57] they say well god has to give it to us
[49:00] so which side is a really a believer i
[49:03] say it's the one who actually go out and
[49:04] possess it
[49:05] and it should be the same thing with you
[49:07] and i remember works as faith expressed
[49:09] i mean that our works our life should be
[49:10] a manifestation of our faith
[49:12] or a manifestation of our revelation
[49:15] amen
[49:16] hallelujah now
[49:20] here we are that and for by grace you're
[49:23] saved through faith that is not of
[49:24] yourselves as a gift of god
[49:26] not of works least any man should boast
[49:28] for you his workmanship created in
[49:30] christ jesus unto good works
[49:31] which god hath before ordained that we
[49:34] should walk in them
[49:35] so if he's ordained me to be a serpent
[49:37] bruiser amen
[49:39] what do you believe you are today
[49:42] hallelujah there we go we'll let it be
[49:43] unto you according to your faith
[49:45] amen remember if you believe you'll
[49:47] never overcome you'll never overcome
[49:49] if you believe you can never be free
[49:50] you'll never be free but if you believe
[49:52] no the lord has made me free
[49:54] i'm going to be free hallelujah you'll
[49:56] be free
[49:57] amen what did what would jesus say let
[49:59] it be unto you according to your faith
[50:02] according to your faith you'll find your
[50:03] daughter that way or whoever you know so
[50:05] it's really what are we believing for
[50:09] now it says here in revelations 1
[50:13] and verse 6 that he has made us kings
[50:17] and priests
[50:17] unto god and his father to him be glory
[50:20] and dominion free and ever amen
[50:22] now a king and a priest has two
[50:25] different roles but these roles are
[50:26] merged into one people
[50:28] now a king we know has a dominion a king
[50:31] has absolute authority in their dominion
[50:33] they don't have a democracy a real king
[50:35] has absolute power
[50:37] what he says will happen what he doesn't
[50:38] say doesn't happen he doesn't have to
[50:40] ask anyone he just says this is how it's
[50:42] going to be this is where we're going
[50:44] if anyone raises up against him it is
[50:46] now a revolution
[50:47] and they're convicted of of of sedition
[50:50] or whatever you call it
[50:51] and that person is normally hung and
[50:53] courted this is medieval times i'm
[50:55] talking about who knows about these
[50:56] things
[50:56] i used to like those things because yeah
[50:58] as a boy and you know
[50:59] swords and fighting and castles and
[51:01] whatever you know but you know that is
[51:03] that is a rebellion
[51:04] if you rise up you know if someone rose
[51:06] up against the king they had to be sure
[51:08] they'd win
[51:10] and so now we have a dominion over over
[51:13] satan
[51:14] hallelujah over hell death in the grave
[51:16] the victory was won that day on calvary
[51:18] and now he has given god has given us
[51:21] that same dominion
[51:22] amen he says all power and heaven earth
[51:25] has been given unto me jesus said after
[51:26] the resurrection what did he do with it
[51:28] he didn't just put it in his trophy
[51:30] cabinet and sit back no he poured it out
[51:32] into his church on the day of pentecost
[51:34] amen giving you that same
[51:36] authority and power that he had because
[51:37] he won it he gave it to you
[51:40] hallelujah so we are kings over a
[51:42] dominion
[51:43] now we're not kings over a physical
[51:45] dominion jesus says my kingdom is not of
[51:47] this world
[51:48] right we're not here to build a republic
[51:51] of whatever
[51:52] you know physically no we're not
[51:54] interested in that we're interested in
[51:55] that god
[51:57] would so fill up people with his
[51:58] presence that they would become a
[52:00] powerhouse
[52:01] amen of the holy ghost hallelujah
[52:04] brother taz used that quote and i just
[52:06] really like it
[52:07] let's just see if we can if i can find
[52:10] it no i probably can't find it but we'll
[52:12] just leave that it'll come as i scroll
[52:14] but he said that we've become
[52:15] powerhouses of the holy ghost now
[52:17] powerhouse
[52:18] i mean has a lot of power in it it's
[52:20] another name for a power plant
[52:22] highly a power plant produces power i
[52:25] mean when the holy ghost comes into you
[52:26] you become a power plant
[52:28] i mean you got nuclear fission going on
[52:31] on the inside of the inside there's no
[52:33] nuclear waste right there's no bad
[52:35] byproduct it's just divine love
[52:36] projecting
[52:37] the power of god projecting peace
[52:39] projecting joy projecting love
[52:41] projecting faith projecting
[52:43] hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right
[52:46] so we become a power plant we don't need
[52:47] to be plugged in we have the source
[52:49] inside
[52:50] amen we've got batteries on the inside
[52:52] already hallelujah
[52:53] we've become a powerhouse and that's
[52:55] what brother brown said i've not come to
[52:57] make organization
[52:58] i've come to make people full of the
[53:00] holy ghost the powerhouse of the holy
[53:02] ghost
[53:03] i mean when the word is manifested
[53:04] through their lives and that's what
[53:06] we're here for isn't it
[53:07] what are we here to do today become
[53:09] powerhouses
[53:10] hallelujah you know if
[53:14] if you know armies they they they they
[53:17] put a whole lot of propaganda behind
[53:18] their
[53:19] latest weapons the north koreans will
[53:21] fire some rocket someplace and they'll
[53:23] blow their trumpet and tell the world
[53:25] look at this missile we have and
[53:26] you know they think they're pretty fancy
[53:28] with it but you know there's a lot of
[53:29] other nations got a far more powerful
[53:31] weapons
[53:32] but they will always project power
[53:34] saying how great we are
[53:36] and if those weapons can do what they
[53:38] say they can do they'll have confidence
[53:39] in that weapon
[53:40] don't mess with me i'll push a button
[53:42] and we'll see you later
[53:44] now we have the mo but if they're afraid
[53:46] if but if they doubt that weapon
[53:48] then they'll doubt their ability to
[53:50] actually stand their ground
[53:52] that's the same thing with the united
[53:53] brotherhood even says that if you think
[53:55] your weapon is equivalent to the devil's
[53:56] weapon the devil's got you
[53:59] right that he thinks you know so the
[54:01] devil tries to get you think you have a
[54:03] he has a weapon
[54:04] but he's defeated i come to remind you
[54:07] the devil's defeated he has no arrows to
[54:09] his bow he's nothing but a bluff
[54:11] amen but if he gets you to think that
[54:13] his doubt is equivalent to your faith
[54:15] he's got you
[54:16] but he is a defeated being i mean this
[54:18] weapon we pack is the best weapon you
[54:20] can ever find in the history of the
[54:22] world
[54:23] hallelujah but you so you've got to
[54:25] recognize what you have the armor we
[54:26] have is the best armor
[54:28] hallelujah i mean so we've got to have
[54:31] confidence
[54:32] hey this thing works amen
[54:36] and i trust you know it works
[54:39] amen so we have you think that same the
[54:42] same faith that came into the
[54:44] upper room on the day of pentecost what
[54:46] did it do it opened the prison doors
[54:48] gave sight to the blind raise the dead
[54:50] healed the sick cast out the devil
[54:52] holy ghost fell upon people that heard
[54:54] the word amen hallelujah devils were
[54:57] cast out
[54:58] salvation came to people that was the
[54:59] faith that that was the weapon they were
[55:01] equipped with
[55:02] and they went out of the upper room
[55:04] shouting and rejoicing and praising god
[55:05] because one they knew it worked but two
[55:07] they knew they had eternal life
[55:09] hallelujah so that so they weren't not
[55:11] gonna die on the battlefield
[55:12] hallelujah they were gonna go all the
[55:14] way and that same faith we've been
[55:16] restored to
[55:18] the weapon you have casts out devils
[55:20] heals the sick
[55:21] raises the dead amen brings divine
[55:23] healing brings salvation brings peace
[55:26] amen brings joy hallelujah cast the
[55:28] devil out
[55:29] that's that's that's the weapon you have
[55:32] i'm looking at a bunch of soldiers today
[55:34] hallelujah amen
[55:37] that's the weapon we have now so we are
[55:40] kings and priests
[55:41] unto god and his father to be him be
[55:44] glory and dominion forever and ever amen
[55:45] just reading the
[55:46] uh verse six so he he's given us
[55:48] dominion over the devil
[55:51] amen you say there's nothing new about
[55:53] this well peter said i just
[55:54] you know i want to tell you again the
[55:56] things you've heard
[55:58] too to make it a bit more real just as
[56:00] we uh
[56:01] heard a couple of sundays ago when the
[56:02] enemy comes in like a flood i'll raise
[56:04] up a standard said the lord and brother
[56:05] ram says
[56:06] he makes the promise more real that's
[56:09] him raising a standard
[56:11] amen so now so now a priesthood or a
[56:14] priest
[56:15] right what do they do brother bam says
[56:17] in the seven church ages he made us
[56:18] priests did you ever know what a priest
[56:20] is what his officers
[56:22] a priest is to make sacrifice to make
[56:24] intercession
[56:25] over in hebrews it said that we the
[56:27] church is the royal priesthood that's
[56:28] peter
[56:29] a royal priesthood a holy nation of
[56:31] peculiar people see
[56:33] hey now that word peculiar it doesn't
[56:35] mean you're odd
[56:37] that means you're a special treasure to
[56:38] god so doesn't mean no you're an oddball
[56:41] sure we're eyeballs to the world but it
[56:42] doesn't make
[56:43] doesn't mean you're weird a weird people
[56:44] that means you're a special treasure to
[56:46] god
[56:46] that word peculiar amen so don't get all
[56:50] complex and funny thinking well i'm just
[56:52] weird no we're the normal people if
[56:55] you've got the mind of christ you're
[56:56] normal
[56:57] you are actually the baseline of normal
[57:00] on the graph do you know everything else
[57:01] is left and right and up and down and
[57:03] whatever how many three-dimensional
[57:05] graph you want it's all over the show
[57:06] but the
[57:07] but the bride that has the mind of
[57:09] christ remember the mind of christ made
[57:11] the world
[57:12] and nature and everything worked right
[57:14] it wasn't a broken system
[57:15] under adam and eve under adam and eve
[57:18] and you know
[57:19] and and then before they fell the world
[57:21] worked
[57:23] right eternal life was there nature was
[57:25] in balance everything was fine
[57:27] and they had the right kind of mind but
[57:29] when sin came in man lost that mind
[57:32] and look at where we've ended up
[57:35] this world is falling apart but yeah we
[57:38] have the best technology the best way to
[57:40] share data
[57:41] see how things work we we're the best
[57:43] systems you think technology wise to
[57:45] make the world run
[57:46] but it barely runs at that
[57:50] you know we produce more food every year
[57:53] than the world needs to eat but yet
[57:54] there's world hunger
[57:56] why is that well it's actually you know
[57:58] it's because of what but yet there's
[57:59] starvation there's millions in
[58:00] starvation
[58:01] why because the world's fallen apart
[58:03] we're the best medical technology that
[58:05] there's ever been praise the lord for it
[58:07] but yet people on waiting lists things
[58:09] happening you know the hospitals are
[58:11] barely running
[58:12] nurses and everyone are burning out why
[58:14] because the world's falling apart
[58:16] you know we have you know in this first
[58:19] world we shouldn't
[58:20] they shouldn't be a hungry person they
[58:22] shouldn't be a sad person
[58:24] they shouldn't be a cold person you know
[58:26] there shouldn't be anything but yet
[58:28] mental illness has skyrocketed families
[58:30] are broken
[58:31] this why because the world has fallen
[58:33] apart
[58:34] malnourished poverty all these things
[58:36] there shouldn't be that in this country
[58:38] but yet it's here why because the world
[58:39] is falling apart or has fallen apart
[58:42] why because the mind of man is darkened
[58:45] that's why i say if you've got the mind
[58:47] of christ you're actually the baseline
[58:49] of normal
[58:51] we're the only saying you know the
[58:52] believers the only sane bunch in the
[58:54] world they
[58:54] people may not think that but yes we are
[58:59] i mean you know as i've said before
[59:00] people think we're brainwashed well yeah
[59:02] my brain needed washing
[59:04] that was a filthy thing i'm glad the
[59:06] blood of jesus christ takes out every
[59:08] stain
[59:09] every mark hallelujah so i'm glad my
[59:12] brain got washed by the holy ghost
[59:14] amen so we are we are so the
[59:18] so the bride or the believer is the
[59:20] bride
[59:21] is kings and priests so now
[59:24] see it's a holy nation of peculiar
[59:26] people a royal priesthood offering here
[59:28] it is now offering spiritual sacrifices
[59:31] every man and woman that comes to god
[59:33] enters into that veil into the holy of
[59:35] holies
[59:35] so we are here to make spiritual
[59:38] sacrifices to our god
[59:39] and to make intercession that's our role
[59:43] so we don't only have a dominion but we
[59:46] can now intercede and make spiritual
[59:47] sacrifices
[59:49] hallelujah you say well there's nothing
[59:52] new about this
[59:53] um you know i was just thinking about
[59:55] wednesday you know when we said about
[59:57] how
[59:58] it's now the time let's just read
[1:00:00] ephesians 3 and 8. unto me
[1:00:01] whom less and all the saints as this
[1:00:03] grace given i should preach among the
[1:00:05] gentiles
[1:00:06] the unsearchable riches of christ and to
[1:00:08] make all men see what is the fellowship
[1:00:10] of the mystery
[1:00:11] which from the beginning of the world
[1:00:12] hath been hidden god who created all
[1:00:14] things by jesus christ
[1:00:16] to the intent that now unto the
[1:00:18] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:00:20] places
[1:00:20] might be known by the church the
[1:00:22] manifold wisdom of god according to the
[1:00:25] eternal purpose which he hath purposed
[1:00:27] in christ jesus our lord
[1:00:28] in whom we have boldness and access with
[1:00:30] confidence by faith
[1:00:32] by the faith of him say well there's
[1:00:34] nothing new about the
[1:00:35] the powers the prince powers and powers
[1:00:37] and heavenly places being known
[1:00:39] be made known unto the church and that's
[1:00:41] true but has it been made known unto you
[1:00:44] that's why we preach these things
[1:00:46] because it hasn't become a revelation to
[1:00:48] you
[1:00:49] you know do you realize the power who we
[1:00:51] who you are in christ you know
[1:00:53] you know my wife read this biography of
[1:00:55] this man called hurricane kelly who
[1:00:56] hurricane kelly was that his name
[1:00:58] what earthquake kelly earthquake kelly
[1:01:01] anyway ones in the air ones on the
[1:01:02] ground but you know
[1:01:03] there's a lot of mess can happen
[1:01:05] earthquake kelly he was raised in
[1:01:06] witchcraft or something but he then he
[1:01:08] became a christian
[1:01:09] and then he saw i think maybe before his
[1:01:11] conversion afterwards
[1:01:12] there was some boys that just gave their
[1:01:14] heart to the lord
[1:01:16] and because they were under the blood
[1:01:17] the devil couldn't get them
[1:01:19] but then they started they baxled and
[1:01:21] went back into the world
[1:01:23] and he thought how foolish they were
[1:01:25] they were actually protected under the
[1:01:27] blood
[1:01:27] even just just giving their hearts to
[1:01:29] the lord not even receiving the holy
[1:01:30] ghost
[1:01:31] he thought how foolish these boys were
[1:01:33] they were under a protection
[1:01:35] but then they walked out from under that
[1:01:37] protection and that's just the way the
[1:01:39] devil is
[1:01:39] he does not want you to realize who you
[1:01:41] are right now
[1:01:43] see if boys who are just justified by
[1:01:45] faith under the blood
[1:01:46] could be protected in such a way how
[1:01:48] much were people who are not just
[1:01:49] justified but sanctified
[1:01:51] and not just sanctified but filled with
[1:01:52] the holy ghost i mean so to realize the
[1:01:55] position that we are in right now
[1:01:57] hallelujah and the protection we have
[1:01:59] right now if you realize who was with
[1:02:01] you every day
[1:02:02] you would be fearless you wouldn't worry
[1:02:04] about nothing
[1:02:05] how you just commit all your cares upon
[1:02:07] the lord because he's with you every day
[1:02:09] he cares for you in your situation he's
[1:02:12] not you know
[1:02:13] he's in control of all things remember
[1:02:14] the jews wanted to kill peter but god
[1:02:16] said he ain't dying here
[1:02:18] he was it had already been prophesied
[1:02:20] jesus told him to death he would die and
[1:02:22] that death was not being beheaded in a
[1:02:23] prison
[1:02:24] so he couldn't die in that place you
[1:02:26] know we're ordained to go on a rapture
[1:02:28] you know we've been prophesied to go on
[1:02:29] a rapture you know the rapture is a
[1:02:31] revelation
[1:02:31] it's got to become real to you amen that
[1:02:33] your body's going to be changed
[1:02:35] hallelujah it's not just some doctrine
[1:02:37] that's airy fairy it's got to become a
[1:02:38] reality
[1:02:39] i'm going to walk with god and will be
[1:02:40] not because god's going to take me
[1:02:43] holy i pray that just break forth upon
[1:02:45] every soul you think about how great
[1:02:46] that is
[1:02:47] i can't die you can kill this thing
[1:02:52] you know in under how many years should
[1:02:54] should the lord tarry this thing will
[1:02:55] die anyway
[1:02:57] i won't be dead i'll be on streets of
[1:03:00] gold
[1:03:01] i'll be living in the presence of the
[1:03:03] one i love and i'll see him face to face
[1:03:05] hallelujah so what could you do imagine
[1:03:07] lazarus after he got resurrected they
[1:03:09] wanted to kill him and jesus
[1:03:11] he would have thought really i just had
[1:03:13] fellowship with oh yeah good
[1:03:15] take my life i'll go i just i'll just
[1:03:17] pick up that fellowship with abraham i
[1:03:19] was having
[1:03:20] hallelujah or moses all you know
[1:03:22] hallelujah so i pray
[1:03:24] that we would really realize the rapture
[1:03:27] is you and i
[1:03:30] amen just like people say the message i
[1:03:31] am the message
[1:03:33] it was a prophecy of a bride coming
[1:03:35] forth hallelujah we're living epistles
[1:03:38] right peter said paul said we're living
[1:03:39] epistles better known of all men
[1:03:41] so actually the living manifestation of
[1:03:43] the word of god
[1:03:44] you know the bible prophesies of a
[1:03:46] people in the end time rising up into
[1:03:48] her position
[1:03:49] i will restore thus saith the lord amen
[1:03:53] hallelujah you know it's easy to look at
[1:03:56] the scripture and you know speak of you
[1:03:58] know see the prophecies of
[1:04:00] of jesus coming right
[1:04:03] you know isaiah 9 6 different ones all
[1:04:05] the way down through from genesis all
[1:04:07] the way down through
[1:04:08] but within those prophecies were a
[1:04:10] people there was a peter james and john
[1:04:13] there was a woman at the well
[1:04:15] you know even even jesus the other
[1:04:16] prophecy where it said that he'd be a
[1:04:18] light to the gentiles
[1:04:19] you know paul said i'm a light to the
[1:04:21] gentiles yes
[1:04:23] he said oh he's just he's just trying to
[1:04:24] grab a scripture that pertains to the
[1:04:26] messiah and potato to himself to make
[1:04:27] himself something
[1:04:28] no it wasn't he was part of that
[1:04:30] prophecy hallelujah so
[1:04:32] so even even within these prophecies of
[1:04:34] the messiah coming
[1:04:35] there had to be a bride coming as well
[1:04:38] that's been prophesied in the scripture
[1:04:39] so really do you know that you are just
[1:04:41] a fulfillment of prophecy
[1:04:45] is this okay you think about it really
[1:04:47] jesus what was what was john's ministry
[1:04:49] the fulfillment of prophecy what was
[1:04:52] jesus ministry the fulfillment of
[1:04:54] prophecy
[1:04:54] what was the upper room a fulfillment of
[1:04:57] prophecy that's why peter said this is
[1:04:58] that spoken by the prophet joel
[1:05:00] i'll pour my spirit out upon all flesh
[1:05:02] he said this is the fulfillment of what
[1:05:04] you've been reading this is manifesting
[1:05:05] right here
[1:05:06] isn't that right hallelujah and then the
[1:05:08] gentiles coming in was a fulfillment
[1:05:10] of prophecy the blinding of the jews a
[1:05:12] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:05:14] amen this world has fallen apart it's a
[1:05:16] fulfillment of prophecy we're in satan's
[1:05:18] eden a fulfillment of prophecy second
[1:05:21] thessalonians
[1:05:22] amen but within all that there's a bride
[1:05:24] i shall restore thus saith the lord
[1:05:27] amen that we would be brought back to
[1:05:29] appear back to the book of acts
[1:05:30] pentecost
[1:05:32] the faith of the fathers holy the bride
[1:05:34] would return
[1:05:35] in the end time so what are we a
[1:05:37] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:05:40] what is this church built on a
[1:05:41] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:05:43] what was the prophet's ministry a
[1:05:45] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:05:47] it's not anything hooky spooks it's just
[1:05:49] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:05:51] amen but we have we got to realize
[1:05:56] that i pray that that becomes a
[1:05:58] revelation to you
[1:05:59] even you take you say well my life is
[1:06:01] pretty mundane
[1:06:02] joseph's life in the prison was pretty
[1:06:04] mundane in egypt
[1:06:06] he didn't do a lot of different things
[1:06:07] you know he you know he eventually came
[1:06:09] to a schedule of running the prison
[1:06:12] oh you know he's in different places in
[1:06:13] part of his house in the prison his life
[1:06:15] became pretty mundane but his life was a
[1:06:17] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:06:19] every day his life was a fulfillment of
[1:06:21] prophecy god was moulding and shaping
[1:06:23] him in the everyday
[1:06:24] do you see god's hand in your life in
[1:06:26] the every day
[1:06:28] you know i trust we don't say i just
[1:06:29] can't wait for the weekend yeah that's
[1:06:31] how it used to be in the world but well
[1:06:32] it was really i can't wait for wednesday
[1:06:34] but you know because the weekend started
[1:06:35] on a wednesday but you know people
[1:06:37] always looking for the future
[1:06:38] god's going to do something for me in
[1:06:39] the future no god's doing something for
[1:06:41] you right now
[1:06:42] and i'm not just talking about this
[1:06:43] service i'm talking about when you wake
[1:06:44] up in the morning he's working and when
[1:06:46] you have lunch he's working when you're
[1:06:47] at school he's working when you're at
[1:06:48] work he's working when your home is
[1:06:50] working
[1:06:51] he's working on you hallelujah
[1:06:55] amen now
[1:06:59] brother bram says and sirs we would see
[1:07:01] jesus so if the church
[1:07:02] only knew its position and the greatest
[1:07:05] hindrance in the church is fair
[1:07:08] they're afraid that it just won't work
[1:07:10] well it just won't work for you that way
[1:07:13] it will not work that way it must be
[1:07:15] absolutely believers
[1:07:17] amen not make believers but believers
[1:07:19] from your heart see so if the church
[1:07:21] only knew its position
[1:07:22] but the greatest hindrances has is fear
[1:07:26] so the devil tries to make us afraid it
[1:07:28] won't work for you
[1:07:30] but you know i always just come i'll be
[1:07:32] thinking about this
[1:07:34] no promise of god has ever worked for
[1:07:36] the devil
[1:07:38] this is his testimony because he doesn't
[1:07:40] believe it
[1:07:41] he fights against it so no promise
[1:07:44] salvation didn't work for him
[1:07:46] healing doesn't work for him deliverance
[1:07:48] doesn't work for him
[1:07:49] right adoption into the body doesn't
[1:07:52] work for him
[1:07:53] peace he can't get it joy and god no he
[1:07:56] can't
[1:07:56] it doesn't work for him right faith no
[1:07:59] he can't get it
[1:08:00] so his testimony is you think it'll work
[1:08:02] for you but he just tries to project his
[1:08:05] experience onto you
[1:08:07] that's what he does you think that oh
[1:08:10] you really think you're the bride well
[1:08:11] he's not the bride he can't be the bride
[1:08:13] but he tries to put it up you think
[1:08:15] you're going to overcome well he can't
[1:08:16] overcome he's already been overcome by
[1:08:18] his own delusion
[1:08:19] he can't be set free by it so he tries
[1:08:21] to make you think you'll never overcome
[1:08:23] you think he can be healed or whatever
[1:08:24] you know he tries to put his own
[1:08:26] experience hey you're following me
[1:08:28] he tries to put his own experience upon
[1:08:30] you why because no promise of god has
[1:08:32] ever been for him
[1:08:33] well actually the only promise of god
[1:08:35] for him is that he's going to burn in a
[1:08:36] lake of fire
[1:08:37] right that's his promise god poor god
[1:08:40] fulfilled your promise for him
[1:08:42] real soon would be nice but for us we're
[1:08:45] in a different category
[1:08:47] amen our lord died for us we have
[1:08:50] salvation salvation's for you and i
[1:08:52] who's just said one day salvation's for
[1:08:54] me
[1:08:56] hallelujah deliverance is for me the joy
[1:08:58] the lord is for me
[1:09:00] amen his strength is for me his peace is
[1:09:03] for me
[1:09:04] his overcoming powers for me
[1:09:08] and i'm not talking about tomorrow i'm
[1:09:09] talking about right now that thing that
[1:09:12] fights you all the time see what you've
[1:09:13] got to recognize we were watching uh was
[1:09:15] it the three or
[1:09:16] you know one of the jeff elkins films
[1:09:18] last night and there was the one bit
[1:09:19] where
[1:09:20] the guy comes along and he keeps walking
[1:09:22] basically around
[1:09:23] and he comes back into the desert
[1:09:25] there's a uh what a windmill he looks up
[1:09:27] he sees that same devily fort
[1:09:29] comes along he kills him comes back
[1:09:31] around
[1:09:32] the seas the windmill again and that
[1:09:34] same devil's there
[1:09:36] he's like but i thought i defeated you
[1:09:39] and then the lord tells them you've got
[1:09:41] to recognize what prophet says you've
[1:09:43] got to recognize that thing died at
[1:09:44] calvary
[1:09:46] just walk on stop stop fighting the
[1:09:49] thing
[1:09:50] now this is a revelation that it's done
[1:09:52] right that you've been
[1:09:53] like and and that devil is telling you
[1:09:55] you'll never be free this is
[1:09:56] generational spirits i'm talking about
[1:09:57] now
[1:09:58] generational problems your parents had
[1:09:59] it you had it yeah you've got it this
[1:10:01] one had it
[1:10:02] you'll never be free because i'm a part
[1:10:03] of you
[1:10:05] right but then he wrote but then the
[1:10:06] lord told him no that thing has been
[1:10:09] defeated at calvary
[1:10:10] that generational problem maybe the
[1:10:12] things your parents did that you're
[1:10:13] stuck with that you can't
[1:10:14] no the lord defeated that at calvary
[1:10:17] amen so just walk on
[1:10:21] hallelujah amen oh i need something
[1:10:24] fancier than that no no you've got to
[1:10:26] recognize your enemies being defeated
[1:10:28] amen amen
[1:10:32] he says in christ the mystery god
[1:10:33] revealed he says the new birth is christ
[1:10:36] is a revelation god has revealed to you
[1:10:38] this great mystery
[1:10:40] and that's a new birth uh now
[1:10:43] what are you gonna do when you get all
[1:10:44] that group together what is that group
[1:10:47] that jesus christ has become a
[1:10:48] revelation to them
[1:10:51] right this is what he's talking about
[1:10:53] where the revelation is perfectly in
[1:10:55] harmony and god expressing it through
[1:10:57] his word by the same actions
[1:10:59] the thing same things that he did making
[1:11:01] the word manifest
[1:11:03] so we've already been through a few
[1:11:04] actions and things he did he cast out
[1:11:06] devils he raised the dead he interceded
[1:11:08] for peter he also prayed for us if you
[1:11:10] read john
[1:11:11] i don't just pray for these but the
[1:11:12] other ones that will believe through
[1:11:13] their word
[1:11:14] amen so he interceded he cast out devils
[1:11:17] he had a dominion
[1:11:19] so what do you do when you get that same
[1:11:21] group together
[1:11:23] that has the revelation perfectly in
[1:11:24] harmony and god expressing
[1:11:27] it through his word by the same actions
[1:11:29] the same things that he did
[1:11:30] making the word manifested oh if the
[1:11:34] church only knew its position
[1:11:35] it will one day then the rapture will go
[1:11:38] when it knows
[1:11:38] what it is i trust that that's more than
[1:11:41] just a nice thing you put on instagram
[1:11:42] or put on your fridge
[1:11:44] but we would realize what we are
[1:11:47] that we are the word made flesh today
[1:11:50] amen now when the lamb takes the book
[1:11:53] in in revelations 5 now when we read in
[1:11:57] revelations 1
[1:11:58] that where we make kings and priests to
[1:12:00] our god now in revelations 5 when the
[1:12:02] lamb takes the book
[1:12:04] the same the same phrase is used again
[1:12:06] the people that said they sung a new
[1:12:08] song
[1:12:09] thou art worthy to take the book to open
[1:12:11] the seals thereof for thou were slain
[1:12:13] and has redeemed us to god by their
[1:12:15] blood out of every kindred tongue and
[1:12:16] people and nation
[1:12:18] and has made us unto our god kings and
[1:12:20] priests and we shall reign on the earth
[1:12:21] so
[1:12:22] now this is just me and my little as
[1:12:24] brother johnny demoff would say this is
[1:12:25] just in fellowship
[1:12:27] that when the lamb takes the book the
[1:12:29] full realization that we are kings and
[1:12:31] priests to our god
[1:12:32] comes into manifestation and i beheld i
[1:12:36] heard the voice of many angels round
[1:12:38] about the throne and the beast
[1:12:40] and the elders and the numbers of them
[1:12:42] were ten thousand times ten thousand and
[1:12:43] thousands of thousands
[1:12:45] saying with a loud voice worthy is the
[1:12:46] lamb that was slain to receive power and
[1:12:48] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:12:50] and glory
[1:12:51] and blessing hallelujah
[1:12:54] so there has become a realization into
[1:12:56] our lives we are kings and priests to
[1:12:57] our god
[1:12:58] we have dominion over the devil this is
[1:13:00] not i'll see if this works we know it
[1:13:01] works
[1:13:02] that we have power to cast the devil out
[1:13:05] that's a principle work of the church is
[1:13:07] to cast out the devil wherever you find
[1:13:09] them
[1:13:10] don't live with them kick them out
[1:13:13] hallelujah
[1:13:16] amen so by
[1:13:18] god god says by for knowledge
[1:13:21] now i'll just read this abraham and a
[1:13:23] seat after him so you see now why the
[1:13:25] church itself
[1:13:26] is pre-elected by god now let me
[1:13:29] take the word out of first thessalonians
[1:13:31] the first chapter said predestinated
[1:13:33] now that's not a good word to use before
[1:13:35] people because predestinated will be
[1:13:37] better
[1:13:37] if we use it like this that it was by
[1:13:39] four knowledge
[1:13:41] god by his foreknowledge could
[1:13:42] predestinate to his own glory see
[1:13:44] he didn't say i'm going to choose i'm
[1:13:46] going to choose you and i'm going to
[1:13:48] send you to hell
[1:13:49] i'm going to choose you and send you to
[1:13:50] hell that isn't god's idea
[1:13:52] he wanted all of us to come to heaven
[1:13:55] but being god he foreknew who would come
[1:13:57] and who would not come
[1:13:58] now that clears out um romans uh
[1:14:02] nine and eight and nine there where he
[1:14:03] said that the election of god might be
[1:14:05] sure
[1:14:06] that before either boy was born talking
[1:14:07] of esau and jacob god said i love jacob
[1:14:09] and i hate east or c
[1:14:11] has for knowledge let him know that esau
[1:14:14] was nothing but little shyster
[1:14:16] anyhow that jacob had recompense to that
[1:14:19] birthright see
[1:14:20] his foreknowledge lets him know if he
[1:14:22] didn't know the end from the beginning
[1:14:24] that he wasn't god see and the bible
[1:14:26] says that we the church what we are
[1:14:28] predestinated so we're previously by
[1:14:30] full knowledge that god could look
[1:14:32] through time and see you
[1:14:34] and i believe if he could say to him
[1:14:36] that and them that overcometh they'll
[1:14:37] sit down on my throne as my as i sat
[1:14:39] down on my father's side and overcome
[1:14:41] i believe he he's seeing me as an
[1:14:43] overcomer
[1:14:44] right so if he see me as an overcomer i
[1:14:46] say lord
[1:14:47] may i manifest that
[1:14:51] do you believe he saw you through time
[1:14:53] before there's any molecule star
[1:14:55] anything and he saw you in this hour
[1:14:57] 2021
[1:14:58] overcoming amen having dominion over the
[1:15:01] devil be victorious by the blood of
[1:15:03] jesus christ
[1:15:04] not defeated not a not a survivor but an
[1:15:07] overcomer
[1:15:08] amen we aren't victims here we're
[1:15:11] overcomers
[1:15:13] holy we're victorious hallelujah
[1:15:17] amen so jesus prayed that peter his
[1:15:20] faith would not fail
[1:15:21] he interceded for him now it's the same
[1:15:24] way as i said with the church they
[1:15:25] interceded prayer was made without
[1:15:26] ceasing of the church
[1:15:28] unto god for peter and so we have the
[1:15:31] same
[1:15:32] office to intercede on people's behalf
[1:15:36] you say
[1:15:36] this is nothing new but i just want to
[1:15:38] emphasize it our prayers work
[1:15:40] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:15:42] righteous man
[1:15:44] availeth much not a veil of little avail
[1:15:46] of march
[1:15:48] amen so our our prayers
[1:15:52] can actually stop satan's will happening
[1:15:55] we know satan has a will in isaiah 14
[1:15:57] and 12 how thou art fallen from heaven o
[1:15:59] lucifer
[1:16:00] son of the morning how thou art cut down
[1:16:02] to the ground which dideth weak in the
[1:16:04] nations
[1:16:04] for thou has said in thy heart i will
[1:16:06] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[1:16:08] throne above the stars of god
[1:16:09] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[1:16:11] congregation the sides of the north
[1:16:13] i will ascend above the heights of the
[1:16:14] clouds i will be like the most high
[1:16:17] that sounds like a man with an agenda
[1:16:19] he's got a will
[1:16:20] but we have the power i say the
[1:16:22] authority this morning
[1:16:23] to stop his will coming to pass in your
[1:16:26] life
[1:16:28] amen see it's just like david there with
[1:16:31] goliath
[1:16:32] it was revealed to david he could take
[1:16:34] out goliath
[1:16:36] goliath's will was we're going to win
[1:16:39] right but a man stepped into the gap
[1:16:41] he said no no you're not going to win
[1:16:43] this is the end
[1:16:45] hello bride brother i'm saying the
[1:16:49] statue of the perfect man that's what i
[1:16:50] was trying to look for before
[1:16:51] we're not building an organization i'm
[1:16:53] not here this morning to build an
[1:16:54] organization
[1:16:55] christ never sent me to build
[1:16:57] organization christ sent me to build
[1:16:58] individuals
[1:16:59] to the statue of jesus christ that they
[1:17:01] might be the powerhouse
[1:17:03] and the dwelling place of the spirit by
[1:17:05] his word by his words he building
[1:17:07] individual to that place not build an
[1:17:10] organization to a greater denomination
[1:17:12] but build the individual to sons and
[1:17:14] daughters of god that's your idea
[1:17:16] add your faith virtue to your virtue
[1:17:17] knowledge well we're coming
[1:17:20] now you're coming to a place so that's
[1:17:22] that's why we have church
[1:17:24] amen and when the holy ghost is enticing
[1:17:28] spirits when the holy ghost
[1:17:30] gospel is nothing more than one great
[1:17:32] powerhouse of joy
[1:17:35] hallelujah what do you believe i believe
[1:17:36] this holy ghost gospel is nothing more
[1:17:38] than one great big powerhouse of joy
[1:17:41] the holy ghost gospel is the perfect
[1:17:44] intoxication
[1:17:45] for every man that's got the blues you
[1:17:48] feeling down
[1:17:49] take a drink hallelujah you're feeling

[1:17:56] gospel of jesus christ

[1:17:59] drunk until you leave this world
[1:18:01] aiming joy unspeakable full of glory
[1:18:04] there's a constant stimulation it's a
[1:18:06] constant indoxification
[1:18:07] drunk day and night amen amen that's the
[1:18:10] word of god
[1:18:12] hallelujah amen hallelujah
[1:18:15] amen as i said a powerhouse we are made
[1:18:18] to be powerhouses of the holy ghost
[1:18:21] right now right now
[1:18:24] now they say i'm a powerhouse of the
[1:18:27] holy ghost by his grace
[1:18:31] amen that's what we that's what we're
[1:18:32] built to be
[1:18:34] brother man says in the deity of jesus
[1:18:35] christ he says the
[1:18:37] son of god that was in the cradle is in
[1:18:39] the heart now
[1:18:40] he's a deity of god he's the god the
[1:18:42] creator
[1:18:43] he was in the world and the world was
[1:18:45] made by him and the world knew him not
[1:18:47] and today that's what's the matter with
[1:18:48] the church the hope of glory
[1:18:50] the baptism of the holy ghost has come
[1:18:52] into the people's hearts
[1:18:54] and they don't recognize what it is they
[1:18:56] think it's a little church joining or
[1:18:58] something like that but
[1:18:59] that is the god the creator living in
[1:19:01] you
[1:19:02] and giving you all the power and you're
[1:19:04] in possession of
[1:19:05] everything that he had and so it
[1:19:08] um so is it in you to abstain from evil
[1:19:12] to do good to shun evil and flee to
[1:19:14] righteousness to turn away from
[1:19:16] temptation
[1:19:17] all malice hatred strife envy and so
[1:19:19] forth come right away from it for it'll
[1:19:22] take him from your heart
[1:19:23] if you will receive him embrace him and
[1:19:26] love him
[1:19:26] and hold him in your heart and love him
[1:19:29] that's a good way to be isn't it
[1:19:30] if you received him just embrace him and
[1:19:32] love him say lord i'm not letting you go
[1:19:34] i know it's you holding on to me but i
[1:19:35] want to hold on to you real good
[1:19:37] hallelujah just like when i pick up
[1:19:39] william he holds on to me
[1:19:40] i'm the one carrying him but he holds on
[1:19:42] to me that's how we should be with the
[1:19:44] lord
[1:19:44] don't you think so i mean i tell you the
[1:19:47] church together with that kind of a
[1:19:48] power
[1:19:50] has the power to bind the heavens heal
[1:19:52] the sick
[1:19:53] open the eyes of the blind hallelujah
[1:19:55] the death
[1:19:56] uh uh the dumb speak the deaf hair the
[1:19:58] cripples walk the blind see why
[1:20:00] it's recognizing the power of or not
[1:20:03] it's recognizing the power of almighty
[1:20:05] god into your heart
[1:20:06] there he is the deity he says you love
[1:20:09] him
[1:20:10] amen so he says here that many people
[1:20:12] don't realize what they have
[1:20:15] they have the holy ghost they don't
[1:20:16] realize what they have because if we
[1:20:18] really
[1:20:18] realize who's in us oh i'd say lord just
[1:20:21] just come live
[1:20:23] take dominion do what you want to do
[1:20:25] hallelujah
[1:20:27] amen but some some will say well i can
[1:20:30] never be
[1:20:30] part of that brotherhood season kinsmen
[1:20:33] redeemer
[1:20:34] oh the love of the father that he has
[1:20:36] shed upon us when we were sinners aliens
[1:20:39] from god
[1:20:40] might be drawn nigh to god and so much
[1:20:41] that we become sons and daughters of god
[1:20:44] not servants the gentile church was
[1:20:46] never a servant no so the gentile church
[1:20:47] is a son and daughter
[1:20:49] you are sons and daughters of god who
[1:20:50] has received the holy ghost
[1:20:52] amen what if you're an offer and turned

[1:21:03] power before god an
[1:21:05] angel an angel's a servant is that right

[1:21:10] daughters who has the most power in
[1:21:12] heaven then

[1:21:17] never fallen who's got more power
[1:21:19] amen the sinner that's been saved by
[1:21:21] grace is more authority in heaven than
[1:21:23] the archangel that stood by aside
[1:21:24] without sin
[1:21:25] because he's a son a son has more
[1:21:27] authority than the servant of course

[1:21:44] us from our sin
[1:21:44] god filled us with his presence
[1:21:46] hallelujah so a sinner saved by grace
[1:21:48] has more authority in heaven than an
[1:21:50] archangel

[1:22:42] right to return now because it's a
[1:22:44] jubilee time
[1:22:46] hallelujah so we are a royal priesthood
[1:22:49] amen we're a royal priesthood so now
[1:22:52] we have an ability to come before god
[1:22:56] and intercede amen he says if you're
[1:23:00] but you're a chosen generation a royal
[1:23:02] priesthood a holy nation of peculiar
[1:23:03] people
[1:23:04] that ye might show forth the praises of
[1:23:06] him who hath called you out of darkness
[1:23:08] into his marvelous light
[1:23:10] amy which in times past were not a
[1:23:12] people but now
[1:23:13] but are now the people of god which had
[1:23:15] not obtained mercy but now have obtained
[1:23:17] mercy

[1:23:26] but do you know what you have
[1:23:28] your life matters your life makes an
[1:23:31] impact
[1:23:32] i mean your life can change the eternal
[1:23:34] destination of somebody
[1:23:35] it can change the course of history
[1:23:37] moses life changed the course of history
[1:23:40] hallelujah john the baptist's life
[1:23:42] changed the course of history
[1:23:43] the the woman of the wells life changed
[1:23:45] the course of history
[1:23:48] her life mattered maybe she thought you
[1:23:50] know when she was going to the well
[1:23:51] you know i said well what's my life
[1:23:53] what's the point of even being
[1:23:55] i've ruined my life but god saw her i
[1:23:58] need to go by the way of samaria
[1:24:00] he had a predestinated seed that he had
[1:24:02] to pick up
[1:24:04] and and redeem because her life was
[1:24:06] going to make an impact
[1:24:08] hallelujah you know maybe peter james
[1:24:09] and john just fishing thinking well i've
[1:24:11] just got to be a fisherman this is just
[1:24:12] you know no one knows me the emperor
[1:24:14] whatever stuff going on in life
[1:24:16] but their lives were going to shake the
[1:24:18] world harley i think it was dwight moody
[1:24:21] there was a old wash woman had a burden
[1:24:23] i want to have a meeting
[1:24:24] and and she would wash clothes and make
[1:24:26] money she hired some old preacher
[1:24:28] you know advertise this meeting i think
[1:24:30] only dwight moody turned up this little
[1:24:31] boy with hair down his back
[1:24:33] gave his heart to the lord hallelujah
[1:24:35] and god used him as a powerhouse
[1:24:37] aiming to send about 500 000 souls at
[1:24:39] least into the kingdom of god
[1:24:41] his life mattered amen is the same thing
[1:24:44] where you say i'm not a big name person
[1:24:45] but you're the bride of christ
[1:24:47] hallelujah it's always it's normally the
[1:24:49] inward parts of the body that matter
[1:24:51] hallelujah right you know you're spleen
[1:24:55] are you conscious of your spleen but you
[1:24:57] need it
[1:24:58] your intestines you conscious of your
[1:25:00] intestines every day no
[1:25:02] you need it it's not on your mind but
[1:25:04] when it when there's a pain in the body
[1:25:06] you realize you really need that
[1:25:07] intestine
[1:25:09] it's the inward parts it's the hidden
[1:25:10] part so i've said before
[1:25:12] you break a bone in your little toe you
[1:25:15] know all about it
[1:25:16] but when it's normal you don't think
[1:25:18] about it but it's those inner inward
[1:25:19] parts that really matter
[1:25:21] so it's not about being the outward bits
[1:25:23] it's the inward bits
[1:25:25] hallelujah we're all important our lives
[1:25:28] have significance
[1:25:29] we're not here just to float along we're
[1:25:31] here to actually change lives
[1:25:33] maybe make an impact in history
[1:25:36] hallelujah
[1:25:37] i mean that if the if hebrews chapter 11
[1:25:40] would continue to be written our names
[1:25:41] would be in that book
[1:25:43] hallelujah that's how important we are
[1:25:46] amen that that that washer woman that's
[1:25:49] all that's recorded of her life in
[1:25:51] history but
[1:25:52] her life is identified with all those
[1:25:54] souls that dwight moody
[1:25:56] saved amen
[1:25:59] he said well i'm not really doing much
[1:26:01] you could just do one thing
[1:26:04] it changed the whole course of someone's
[1:26:05] life oh but we're in a gleaning time
[1:26:08] don't ever just don't listen we might be
[1:26:12] but don't ever just like dilute it down
[1:26:14] and say well maybe there's just one or
[1:26:15] two
[1:26:16] there could be a whole bunch you know
[1:26:17] uganda exploded a few years ago
[1:26:20] there's about 50 000 people just came in
[1:26:22] into the message in about three years
[1:26:25] and they're all from all different
[1:26:26] denominations it's gone now into the
[1:26:27] seventh adventist they're coming out
[1:26:29] it's just exploded you know the message
[1:26:33] has been there since the 70s
[1:26:36] oh but that's africa uh we're still on
[1:26:38] the same planet earth
[1:26:40] we're all people so why can't god do
[1:26:43] that here
[1:26:44] are you just too far out there no who
[1:26:47] says i am
[1:26:49] why should we limit god to say well
[1:26:51] there's maybe one or two
[1:26:53] what if there's 50 000 people coming
[1:26:55] amen
[1:26:56] and i i don't care i don't care who god
[1:26:58] uses to do it
[1:26:59] just say if it would happen i'm not i
[1:27:01] don't care as long as someone does it
[1:27:03] you know if you want god to bless you
[1:27:05] you're going to be happy and god blesses
[1:27:06] someone else
[1:27:07] you want god to use you to be happy for
[1:27:08] god to use someone else
[1:27:10] amen you can't be jealous of anything
[1:27:12] god does because god won't use you
[1:27:15] amen but we have boldness to come into
[1:27:17] the holiest of all by the blood of jesus
[1:27:19] christ
[1:27:20] we've got boldness to come in i mean
[1:27:23] just like esther as we're saying on
[1:27:24] wednesday
[1:27:25] she actually the one person that the
[1:27:28] king would have wanted next to his side
[1:27:29] was her
[1:27:31] but she was afraid to go in but the king
[1:27:34] hasn't called me for 30 days
[1:27:35] and you know some people just sit back
[1:27:37] and say well if i'm predestined i'm
[1:27:39] predestined if i'm not well i'm not
[1:27:41] that's unbelief talking
[1:27:43] you know you can't just sit back and say
[1:27:45] well if god will he will if not not no
[1:27:47] no
[1:27:47] the violent take the kingdom by force
[1:27:50] god is rewarder of them that diligently
[1:27:52] seek him
[1:27:54] he's a reward he actually rewards so
[1:27:55] that seekers will
[1:27:57] lord what would you have for my life
[1:27:59] lord what about this situation this
[1:28:00] person said this this he rewards those
[1:28:02] kind of people
[1:28:04] he doesn't reward those people say well
[1:28:05] if it's predestinated it'll happen
[1:28:07] and you know the big problem through
[1:28:08] church history if people have cabbage
[1:28:10] down on predestination too much
[1:28:12] that's why that's why john wesley came
[1:28:14] in with armenianism
[1:28:17] because the church world had cabbage
[1:28:19] down on calvinism too much
[1:28:21] what's the point of sending missionaries
[1:28:22] well if they're there they're there not
[1:28:24] not they'll come in somewhere
[1:28:25] that's unbelief talking and he brought
[1:28:28] the church back more towards the middle
[1:28:29] but now we know under the message we
[1:28:31] have a perfect balance between calvinism
[1:28:33] and armenianism
[1:28:34] right but so but god has always had to
[1:28:37] swing the church say come on
[1:28:39] what are you going to do about it amen
[1:28:42] you've got a weapon you've got armor
[1:28:44] get on the battlefield hallelujah you
[1:28:47] pray pray big
[1:28:48] you know i can't remember who said it
[1:28:49] but if god's on your side you should
[1:28:51] have big plans
[1:28:52] you used to have real big plans you've
[1:28:53] got a real big god hallelujah
[1:28:57] amen but the devil will say well you
[1:28:59] don't
[1:29:00] no those things won't happen why because
[1:29:02] god doesn't you know it won't happen for
[1:29:04] him
[1:29:07] amen nothing wrong with having big plans
[1:29:08] with god amen
[1:29:10] amen remember the footsteps of the
[1:29:12] righteous are ordered of the lord but
[1:29:13] you've got to walk
[1:29:14] for god to drive you
[1:29:18] amen he says there's a man here that can
[1:29:20] turn on the light
[1:29:23] there's a man present don't get scared
[1:29:25] no matter what they say i've seen it
[1:29:27] come to the spot to where i don't know
[1:29:29] where to move next but he's always
[1:29:30] present
[1:29:31] the never failing presence he's always
[1:29:33] there he can turn on the light yes sir
[1:29:36] he's just waiting to see what you're
[1:29:38] going to do
[1:29:39] he can flip the switch on any time he
[1:29:41] wants to yes sir
[1:29:42] she's waiting to see what are you going
[1:29:44] to do about it are you going to turn to
[1:29:46] him
[1:29:47] or are you just going to go up on some
[1:29:49] kind of tantrum somewhere
[1:29:50] this person this person this is wrong
[1:29:52] whatever no are you going to turn to him
[1:29:53] he's saying what are you going to do
[1:29:56] amen and he says here in awakening jesus
[1:29:59] that's why
[1:30:00] you're sick tonight maybe that's why
[1:30:03] the lull of the revival is to see what
[1:30:05] you're going to do about
[1:30:07] it but to see what you're going to do
[1:30:10] about what you've seen
[1:30:11] done are you going to pick it up make
[1:30:14] another organization out of it
[1:30:16] so that's the same question with you and
[1:30:17] i what are we gonna do
[1:30:19] about what we've seen done
[1:30:23] we've seen the son of man revealed in
[1:30:24] this day and the prophet tells us the
[1:30:26] son of man is not just in a one-man
[1:30:28] ministry but he's still being revealed
[1:30:30] in a bride body around the world
[1:30:32] jesus christ is alive i mean we could
[1:30:34] run down the street and say come see a
[1:30:36] man
[1:30:36] that's totally all i've ever done is
[1:30:38] this not the messiah this is not
[1:30:40] religion there's a true and living god
[1:30:41] the bible we're in bible days again
[1:30:44] what are we going to do about it
[1:30:46] hallelujah amen brother ram says that we
[1:30:48] emphasize the
[1:30:49] mechanics so much we forget the dynamics
[1:30:52] right we can have all the mechanics we
[1:30:53] want that's what what
[1:30:54] what is an organization that's just all
[1:30:56] mechanics
[1:30:57] we have this treaties and this is how
[1:30:59] things are this is what the pastor does
[1:31:00] and it's all kind of bottled down like
[1:31:02] this
[1:31:02] but there's no dynamics in that thing
[1:31:06] hallelujah hey we have the mechanics we
[1:31:09] want more dynamics or maybe i just want
[1:31:11] more dynamics
[1:31:12] i want to see god just take over take
[1:31:14] over my life not just in church but i
[1:31:16] wake up in the morning i'm no longer my
[1:31:17] own
[1:31:18] i'm his no longer my thoughts it's his
[1:31:20] thoughts not my words his words
[1:31:22] not my ambition his ambition that's how
[1:31:25] i want to be every day
[1:31:26] and we're coming to church god just
[1:31:28] takes off your web at times of singing
[1:31:29] i've just been in the back marbling
[1:31:31] this is god singing it's like god just
[1:31:34] takes over the worship
[1:31:36] hallelujah well yo yo we've had those
[1:31:37] thoughts i said it to brother isaac i
[1:31:38] think it's like god just took over
[1:31:41] took over the singing hallelujah hey
[1:31:43] we're singing the same songs
[1:31:44] it's different when god takes over or
[1:31:46] when we're actually trying to drive the
[1:31:47] thing
[1:31:48] amen and so it should be the same thing
[1:31:50] god just take over
[1:31:52] pour in the dynamics what is what is
[1:31:53] what has god really done in this time
[1:31:55] this is just me
[1:31:56] he's taking all the limitations off god
[1:31:58] of himself
[1:31:59] the seals came off the book he's
[1:32:01] revealing christ to you and i
[1:32:03] he's taking all the man-made limitations
[1:32:05] off of god
[1:32:06] hallelujah well that's what i think
[1:32:08] anyway i think god's unlimited in his
[1:32:09] power
[1:32:10] and limiting his ability he's the
[1:32:12] almighty just like brother umph
[1:32:14] said yo let god be god don't let it
[1:32:17] don't let god be a
[1:32:18] object your of your imagination what you
[1:32:20] think he can do let him be him
[1:32:23] amen he created every molecule every
[1:32:26] piece of matter in existence he made it
[1:32:29] he spoke it forth you don't think he can
[1:32:31] bring order yo
[1:32:32] bring chaos into order he can bring an
[1:32:34] or life that's in chaos and bring it
[1:32:36] into order
[1:32:37] what were our lives chaos he's spoken to
[1:32:40] that chaos brought an order
[1:32:42] amen we're away from god alienated from
[1:32:44] him he brought us into order
[1:32:45] why did he bring us into order that that
[1:32:47] order would push forth
[1:32:48] and impact someone else it's like a
[1:32:50] chain reaction who seen a chain reaction
[1:32:52] which had a nuclear bomb
[1:32:54] yeah that's a little thing but just it's
[1:32:56] just a few it's just a few atoms
[1:32:58] striking other atoms just a big big
[1:33:00] you know that's what our life should be
[1:33:03] like
[1:33:04] hallelujah just a big chain reaction
[1:33:08] amen out holy yeah the holy ghost
[1:33:10] influenced me to this person this person
[1:33:12] that person that person to this person
[1:33:13] yeah just be a chain reaction going
[1:33:15] through from me down to my family my
[1:33:17] family back up to me
[1:33:20] hallelujah shouldn't it be that way you
[1:33:22] know the girls at night gabe says are we
[1:33:23] gonna have family prayer now
[1:33:26] praise the lord what's that a chain
[1:33:27] reaction is coming back let's pray let's
[1:33:29] read
[1:33:30] let's sing hallelujah amen
[1:33:33] that's good
[1:33:36] so we need to so he's a rewarder of them
[1:33:39] that diligently seek him
[1:33:41] hey we're more than a nuclear bomb
[1:33:44] amen remember the one that made the sun
[1:33:47] is a new
[1:33:48] and i don't know how many they've tried
[1:33:50] to quantitate the amount of energy or
[1:33:52] you know all the nuclear fission that
[1:33:53] happens in the sun that's a nuclear
[1:33:55] reactor
[1:33:55] that's not fuel nuclear fusion sorry
[1:33:58] that happens in the sun
[1:33:59] we're more powerful than that that ball
[1:34:02] of burning gas up there takes about
[1:34:04] eight odd minutes for the sunlight to
[1:34:05] get from the sun to here
[1:34:07] we're more powerful than that because
[1:34:08] the one that made that is in us
[1:34:11] hallelujah but we need to seek the lord
[1:34:14] for every situation
[1:34:16] right lord what is your will david
[1:34:19] went to battle with the sling against
[1:34:22] the lion and the bear and goliath
[1:34:24] there's no record he picks up the sing
[1:34:25] again
[1:34:27] there's some battles where i mean pretty
[1:34:29] much every battle he would fight
[1:34:31] he would seek the lord first and
[1:34:33] sometimes the lord would say
[1:34:35] go up and fight them they've been given
[1:34:36] into your hand
[1:34:38] but there's in chronicles 14 it says
[1:34:40] therefore god enquired again of the lord
[1:34:43] and god said unto him go not up after
[1:34:45] them turn away from them and come
[1:34:47] upon them over against the mulberry
[1:34:49] trees
[1:34:50] and it shall be when they hear a sound
[1:34:52] of a going in the tops the mulberry
[1:34:53] trees
[1:34:54] that then thou shall go out to battle
[1:34:56] for for god has gone before thee to
[1:34:58] smite
[1:34:59] the host of the philistines so he had to
[1:35:01] wait on god
[1:35:02] should i charge should i retreat shall i
[1:35:04] move here what should i do
[1:35:06] he was sensitive to the leading of the
[1:35:07] lord
[1:35:09] we should be the same way you know
[1:35:11] there's different plans for different
[1:35:12] battles
[1:35:14] you couldn't take things you know for
[1:35:15] example you couldn't take the
[1:35:17] battle plan that the soviets had to
[1:35:20] invade nazi germany
[1:35:21] and apply it to the normandy landings or
[1:35:24] apply it to the pacific
[1:35:26] it wouldn't work the terrain's different
[1:35:28] the battle's different right
[1:35:30] and we have different battles we've got
[1:35:31] to face we say lord what is your will in
[1:35:32] this battle
[1:35:34] you know it's just like god has many
[1:35:35] different ways of healing
[1:35:37] and you can apply this to the four
[1:35:39] anointings of the cherubim
[1:35:41] for example the lion anointing
[1:35:44] yet prayed for and you get well over
[1:35:46] time they shall lay hands upon the sick
[1:35:48] and they shall recover
[1:35:50] brotherhood says that that is that is
[1:35:52] divine healing
[1:35:53] but another one can be an instant
[1:35:55] healing which is a miracle
[1:35:57] he said people misunderstood the
[1:35:58] difference between a miracle and divine
[1:36:00] healing
[1:36:01] divine healing is actually it basically
[1:36:03] your body flushes it out
[1:36:05] but a miracle is a miracle that's gone
[1:36:07] instant like the eagle you could say
[1:36:09] or it could be you have to go by man's
[1:36:11] ways through medicine
[1:36:13] or how's your diet are you getting
[1:36:14] enough sleep are you really you know
[1:36:16] you're all stood up in your mind have
[1:36:18] you thought of relaxing or reading a
[1:36:20] book or something that you know to try
[1:36:22] and just you know
[1:36:23] hello yeah that's like man's way doing
[1:36:26] things
[1:36:27] or it can be a sickness under death like
[1:36:29] the ox anointing
[1:36:31] because remember elisha he got sick and
[1:36:33] that sickness took him to death
[1:36:35] but the main thing is you're gonna seek
[1:36:37] the lord and so the lord will show you
[1:36:38] which one it is
[1:36:40] and the whole purpose of it is that your
[1:36:41] faith will not fail
[1:36:43] right because you can receive a sickness
[1:36:45] that will take your life but it won't
[1:36:47] take your faith
[1:36:49] amen and really you step from this body
[1:36:51] to a new body that's a divine healing
[1:36:54] hallelujah why because you you you're
[1:36:56] healed you've been liberated from that
[1:36:57] sickness
[1:36:58] it's no longer oppressing you anymore
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:02] but now in order for our faith i called
[1:37:05] this and i tell you now at
[1:37:06] 11 35 that i want to talk about being
[1:37:08] putting faith into action
[1:37:11] and that wasn't a preliminary that was
[1:37:12] basically the whole sermon you know
[1:37:14] but it says in galatians 5 for we
[1:37:17] through the spirit
[1:37:18] wait for the hope of righteousness by
[1:37:20] faith for in jesus christ neither
[1:37:22] circumcision availeth anything nor
[1:37:24] uncircumcision
[1:37:26] but faith worketh by love
[1:37:29] so the way faith works is by love
[1:37:32] that's why the devil wants us to be
[1:37:34] grumpy at each other
[1:37:36] that faith doesn't work it becomes the
[1:37:39] wrath of man praising god
[1:37:41] instead of out of divine love
[1:37:45] faith can't work if it's not by love
[1:37:48] so it's absolutely such an important
[1:37:50] fundamental principle in the christian
[1:37:52] walk
[1:37:52] do not lose your love for anybody amen
[1:37:56] if you've lost your love the devil's got
[1:37:57] you because your faith ain't going to
[1:37:59] work
[1:38:00] hey you can still dress the part speak
[1:38:02] the part be the part but what about
[1:38:03] being a possessor of the promise
[1:38:06] not just a professor
[1:38:10] a means of faith worketh by love that's
[1:38:12] divine love
[1:38:13] now brother brown says in desperations
[1:38:15] he says now the word plainly states
[1:38:17] if you want to put this down galatians 5
[1:38:18] and 6 faith worketh by love see faith
[1:38:21] worketh by love
[1:38:22] and the only way you can have faith is
[1:38:23] to have love first
[1:38:25] because after all faith is love's
[1:38:27] incentive
[1:38:28] that's exactly what faith is it's an
[1:38:30] incentive to love now
[1:38:31] if you don't have love you can't have
[1:38:33] faith see how can you have faith in your
[1:38:36] wife if you don't love her
[1:38:38] that's in the philia which is just a
[1:38:39] human love now how about in the agapo
[1:38:42] to god how can it be if you don't love
[1:38:45] god if you said that you loved your wife
[1:38:47] and you never
[1:38:48] told tell her about it never set her
[1:38:50] down and make love to her expressed it
[1:38:52] to her kissed her hugged her
[1:38:54] and tell her she's the best cook in the
[1:38:55] country all the things that you
[1:38:58] know and how pretty she is and how much
[1:39:00] you love her if you didn't do that
[1:39:01] she'll never know it that's the way if
[1:39:03] you love her you express it
[1:39:06] that's the way we do to god when we love
[1:39:08] him we tell him about it
[1:39:10] we sit down and adore him and worship
[1:39:12] him and see
[1:39:13] love drives us to that hallelujah
[1:39:17] amen you mean to express yourself and
[1:39:19] how great how great your spouse is or
[1:39:21] how great the lord is what is love
[1:39:23] drives you to tell them or to put it
[1:39:24] into action
[1:39:26] hallelujah amen i got one big grin i'm
[1:39:28] pretty happy about that one
[1:39:30] hallelujah praise the lord but shouldn't
[1:39:32] it be that way
[1:39:33] it's not just you know someone said
[1:39:37] ah i you know they say like a husband
[1:39:40] never tells their wife that you know he
[1:39:41] loves her
[1:39:42] and he said well i told you when i
[1:39:44] propose if it changes i'll tell you
[1:39:46] you know what kind of what kind of life
[1:39:48] would that be you're always living she'd
[1:39:50] always been living in this uncertain
[1:39:52] limbo
[1:39:52] does he still love me after i've had the
[1:39:55] kids and all this has happened da da da
[1:39:57] da you know
[1:39:58] does he still love me and he never says
[1:39:59] it that's like god
[1:40:01] you know god's a person he wants us to
[1:40:04] express
[1:40:05] back to him what we mean to him
[1:40:09] is he your everything he is you all
[1:40:11] isn't he just wonderful
[1:40:13] he's the great one he saved me when i
[1:40:16] was on
[1:40:16] when i thought i was unsavable he
[1:40:18] redeemed me when i thought i was
[1:40:19] unredeemable
[1:40:20] when no one else cared about me jesus
[1:40:22] cares he cared a lot
[1:40:25] hallelujah he cared so much he poured
[1:40:26] his life out if he went to calvary just
[1:40:29] for me he would have done it all the
[1:40:30] same
[1:40:31] hallelujah if this yeah if the rapture
[1:40:33] was just for one
[1:40:34] god would have had the prophet go
[1:40:35] through all he did just for me
[1:40:38] hallelujah he brother brahm says and he
[1:40:41] cares do you care and i hope that each
[1:40:43] one of you get that especially
[1:40:45] you people to be prayed for that so
[1:40:46] uncomfortable this morning
[1:40:48] and maybe troubles that doctors cannot
[1:40:50] touch you know these troubles doctors
[1:40:52] cannot touch
[1:40:54] right we believe that doctors help
[1:40:56] people i believe that god heals by
[1:40:58] medicine
[1:40:59] god heals by surgery god heals by
[1:41:01] understanding
[1:41:02] god heals by love just a little love
[1:41:05] goes a long way
[1:41:07] let somebody be all upset and just show
[1:41:09] them you care for them see
[1:41:10] god heals by love god heals by prayer
[1:41:14] god heals by miracles god heals by his
[1:41:17] word god heals
[1:41:18] whatever source it is god heals by it
[1:41:20] it's god that heals free said i'm the
[1:41:22] lord god that heals all thy diseases
[1:41:24] so all of it should work together and
[1:41:26] man and different ministry should work
[1:41:28] together for that see
[1:41:30] amen hallelujah now
[1:41:34] we're just going to i'm just going to
[1:41:36] read one more scripture
[1:41:38] well if the musicians want to come

[1:41:41] description a couple of quotes
[1:41:43] i know there's been quite a bit of
[1:41:44] reading but this is here this is how we
[1:41:46] are
[1:41:47] you know a pastor does a bit of
[1:41:48] everything right we're not a one-trick
[1:41:50] pony
[1:41:51] so sometimes we'll dance around
[1:41:52] sometimes we'll just stand here
[1:41:54] sometimes we'll do a bit of both right
[1:41:57] so
[1:41:58] you know the important thing is
[1:42:02] you become the word as you receive the
[1:42:03] word the important thing is lord

[1:42:10] become

[1:42:19] to read this in a couple of quotes
[1:42:20] i'll bless the lord at all times his
[1:42:23] praise shall continually be in my mouth
[1:42:26] you know if his praise is continuing in
[1:42:28] your mouth you've got no room for
[1:42:29] for for fussing fighting stews troubles
[1:42:32] quarrels there's no room
[1:42:34] my soul shall make her boast in the lord
[1:42:36] the humble
[1:42:37] shall hear of and be glad o magnify the
[1:42:40] lord with me let us exalt
[1:42:42] his name together i sought the lord and
[1:42:44] he heard me
[1:42:45] and delivered me from all my fears they
[1:42:47] looked upon him and were lightened and
[1:42:49] their faces were not ashamed
[1:42:50] this poor man cried and the lord heard
[1:42:53] him and saved him out of all of his
[1:42:55] troubles the angel of the lord encampeth
[1:42:57] around about them that fear him and
[1:42:59] delivereth them
[1:43:00] o taste and see that the lord is good
[1:43:03] blessed is the man
[1:43:04] that trusteth in him hallelujah now
[1:43:07] brother abraham was um he was preaching
[1:43:10] god hiding himself in simplicity and
[1:43:12] this was in my notes before we
[1:43:14] we're talking about yes we talk about
[1:43:15] things on a saturday night
[1:43:17] i'm like they're already in my notes
[1:43:20] anyway
[1:43:20] and anyway so it's not me talking about
[1:43:23] it's christine's
[1:43:24] telling me about it anyway now it says
[1:43:27] so so this is at the end of the service
[1:43:28] and
[1:43:29] um sister vanessa um um highlighted this
[1:43:31] says now just a few minutes ago
[1:43:33] it was traveling so it's about the angel
[1:43:35] lord moving in the congregation
[1:43:37] a light came from over this way way back
[1:43:39] here way over there and back again i
[1:43:41] said to brother demus shakarian
[1:43:42] come here come here see see it coming
[1:43:45] right here watch as it passes over

[1:44:20] you can sit down don't make any
[1:44:22] difference where you're at
[1:44:23] but where you will open yourself up and
[1:44:26] then the holy spirit will
[1:44:28] strike then well sometimes it begins to
[1:44:31] anoint you
[1:44:32] and you don't just lead on through with
[1:44:34] it you get a little scared you're afraid
[1:44:36] you pull back
[1:44:37] just surrender yourself surrender
[1:44:39] yourself to the holy spirit

[1:44:58] something warm came over him

[1:45:02] himself right then that's all
