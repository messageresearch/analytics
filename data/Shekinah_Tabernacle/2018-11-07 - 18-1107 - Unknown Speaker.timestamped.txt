[36:20] let's um let's go to the Book of Isaiah
[36:22] and we'll go to chapter 6
[36:32] as i Sexson in verses one to five on
[36:36] trustus is familiar to everyone here but
[36:41] the word never gets old
[36:45] see Isaiah six verses one to five
[36:50] we're gonna go to Exodus chapter three
[36:52] in verses 1 to 4 Isaiah 6 and one sees
[36:56] here in the year that King Uzziah had
[36:58] died
[36:59] I also saw the Lord sitting upon a
[37:01] throne high and lifted up and his train
[37:03] filled the temple above it stood the
[37:05] seraphim's each one had six wings with
[37:07] Twain with twain he covered his face
[37:10] with twain he covered his feet and with
[37:12] twain he did fly and he cried unto
[37:14] another and said holy holy holy is the
[37:17] lord of hosts the earth is full of his
[37:20] glory and the posts of the door moved at
[37:23] the voice of him that cried and the
[37:25] house was filled with smoke Dean said I
[37:28] was me for I am undone
[37:30] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[37:32] dwell in the midst of knowing of a
[37:34] people of unclean lips for mine eyes
[37:35] have seen the king the Lord of hosts I
[37:38] mean let's go to Exodus 3 can you turn
[37:42] that down a bit not used to hearing
[37:48] myself Exodus 3 verses 1 to 4 now Moses
[37:55] kept the flock of Jethro his
[37:56] father-in-law the priest of Midian and
[37:59] he led the flock to the backside of the
[38:01] desert and came to the mountain of God
[38:02] even to Horeb and the angel the Lord
[38:05] appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out
[38:07] of the midst of a bush and he looked and
[38:09] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[38:11] bush was not consumed and Moses said
[38:14] I'll now turn aside and see this great
[38:17] sight why the bush is not burnt and when
[38:20] the Lord saw that he turned aside to see
[38:22] God called unto Him now the myths of the
[38:24] bush and see had Moses Moses and he said
[38:28] here am I may the Lord bless his word
[38:31] this night you may you may have your
[38:33] seats
[38:39] trust you haven't come here just to go
[38:43] through a religious service brother
[38:46] Brahim speaks about Moses on the
[38:47] backside of the desert the air and he
[38:49] says he says that he was he was going
[38:52] down perhaps an old familiar path one
[38:56] hot morning perhaps and then all at once
[38:58] there came a bush on fire and the bush
[39:00] did not consume well it was altogether
[39:02] unusual he says it in a few places like
[39:06] that where he went was going down an old
[39:07] familiar path maybe he had been down
[39:09] that path you know he was there on the
[39:13] backside desert for 40 years maybe he
[39:15] went down that path once a year so 40
[39:17] times or 80 times I don't know but you
[39:19] know it's like church sometimes we you
[39:21] know some of us been raised in church
[39:23] you know we've been to services three
[39:26] services you know since we're from the
[39:28] cradle and it becomes a familiar old
[39:30] path you know we come to church we sing
[39:33] a few songs someone gets up and prays
[39:34] you know there's a special there's a
[39:36] testimony or Sunday school or whatever
[39:39] it may be you know you've got to get
[39:40] your church clothes on and you know
[39:42] you've got to get there and you know it
[39:44] becomes a very familiar place it comes a
[39:47] very you know you know you normally sit
[39:49] in the same seat you know normally
[39:52] certain song leaders will pick
[39:53] particular songs they like and it
[39:55] becomes familiar and and even the
[39:57] minister will have a certain mannerisms
[39:59] and how he will minister and how his
[40:01] hands will go and you know it becomes
[40:03] familiar but in familiar times God can
[40:07] come and it can turn from just being a
[40:09] familiar thing to an unfamiliar thing we
[40:13] see Isaiah was here ago or maybe licious
[40:15] now Moses for a little but Moses was on
[40:18] the backside of the desert for forty
[40:20] years and God was molding him through
[40:23] that time that he had ever visitation
[40:25] and he would then go down to Egypt and
[40:27] he would deliver his people out of Egypt
[40:29] now the most important thing is in life
[40:32] as you meet God for yourself I mean it's
[40:35] more than anything in the world as you
[40:37] meet him I mean where the word becomes
[40:40] more than someone else's testimony or
[40:42] more than just pages in a Bible or more
[40:45] than even the prophets voice on tape but
[40:47] if it becomes a living
[40:49] elevate to you hallelujah where he goes
[40:52] from a God of a god of history or God of
[40:55] maybe what he'll do in the future do
[40:56] becomes a present God and that's what
[40:59] Jesus Christ he is the same yesterday
[41:01] and brother are emphasized today and
[41:03] forever and I believe we should we
[41:06] should emphasize the same thing he's the
[41:08] same today and and there he was he was
[41:11] there on the banks of it is that then
[41:12] God made him and God made him for a
[41:15] specific purpose and brother branham
[41:16] tells us that the devil cannot take our
[41:19] lives until we have finished our earlier
[41:21] fulfilled our purpose upon the earth so
[41:23] nothing can take you from this mortal
[41:25] coil until God is finished with you
[41:28] hallelujah so if you've still got life
[41:31] in your body you've got a purpose upon
[41:32] the earth and you should say Lord I want
[41:34] to live my purpose out whatever the
[41:36] purpose may be I want to I want to
[41:38] fulfill it now we understand in the
[41:41] scripture that every believer had a
[41:42] struggle they had a battle sometimes
[41:45] just getting out of bed can be a
[41:47] struggle getting to church on time can
[41:49] be a struggle right but the main thing
[41:51] is you get there hallelujah you can have
[41:53] all this turmoil in your mind and and
[41:55] the devil fights you you know who has
[41:59] the devil there before you trying to get
[42:01] the church right that's everything in
[42:04] God just plain sailing and then you had
[42:07] some turbulence and you should have
[42:09] realized all the Devils up ahead because
[42:10] my destination is God's presence and
[42:13] that's why there's this turbulence that
[42:14] I'm sailing through right now we should
[42:16] expect it we shouldn't be surprised
[42:19] we shouldn't come into this place
[42:21] condemned right just because we've had a
[42:23] fuss at an argument and whatever more
[42:25] you know the kids are fine then then
[42:27] they start acting up and this one does
[42:29] this and this one everything's going
[42:30] backwards and and you wonder why you
[42:32] should say a blessings on its way
[42:34] holy and blessings always like when you
[42:37] land in Wellington 99.9 percent of time
[42:39] there's turbulence
[42:40] he's got tariff levers on its way I've
[42:42] been a land fellow a
[42:44] doesn't matter what the wind is doing
[42:45] I'm going to land and it's the same
[42:47] thing with the Lord the devil always
[42:49] fights before the blessing comes and as
[42:52] soon as the promise is given that's when
[42:54] the battle really happens right it's not
[42:56] before the promise but when the word
[42:58] becomes alive personally to you it's
[43:00] quick into your soul then the battle
[43:02] really sets in because the devil is
[43:05] trying to push you off your promise push
[43:07] you away from your promise take your
[43:08] faith away we're going to stand
[43:10] flat-footed on the trial so I will not
[43:12] be moved
[43:13] hallelujah so Moses you know he had a he
[43:16] had a you know he had some battles on
[43:19] the backside of the desert he had some
[43:20] tough times but there were nothing
[43:21] compared to the tough times he was about
[43:23] to enter hallelujah but he stood the
[43:26] main thing is he was in the presence of
[43:28] the burning bush and everything Moses
[43:30] lack was in the presence of God
[43:31] hallelujah went beyond just a natural
[43:34] scene of looking for pasture and there's
[43:35] my sheep and watch out for dogs and
[43:37] whatever predators were there he was in
[43:40] God's presence and it was very different
[43:43] holy and it changed them now Isaiah that
[43:46] we read about Isaiah was a contemporary
[43:49] of King Uzziah and actually were
[43:51] basically the same kind of age and
[43:52] brother Bram says that King Uzziah
[43:54] became he wrote Isaiah because he stood
[43:58] for God you know God gave him great
[44:00] victories and and he admired the king
[44:03] and the other King and the prophet
[44:05] they're both godly men but the thing is
[44:07] you've got to come to a place where all
[44:09] human human things to lean against you
[44:13] know you can't you to stand alone with
[44:16] God and sometimes even godly influence
[44:18] has to be taken out of the way where God
[44:21] can deal with you amen we've got to come
[44:25] to a place where all humanity is put to
[44:27] one side and God comes down hallelujah
[44:31] so King Uzziah he came to a place where
[44:34] he has lifted up and pride you know
[44:35] you've got to stand alone with God you
[44:37] understand what I'm saying you can't
[44:38] depend upon the person next to you it's
[44:40] you and God it's young God right we're
[44:44] in a body we need each other but
[44:45] ultimately it's you and God aim it's a
[44:49] king uzziah we know he got lifted up and
[44:51] pride he wanted through the priests
[44:52] office and he took a sensor and he
[44:56] wanted to be a priest and the priest
[44:57] tried to stop him but
[44:58] said I'll do it anyway and he was
[45:00] smoking with leprosy anywhere as he was
[45:01] banished from the throne and this is
[45:04] where now Isaiah comes it let's go down
[45:07] to the temple
[45:09] you're about 40 under how old he was
[45:11] maybe about 40 years old his hero had
[45:14] just fallen in an unexpected way and now
[45:18] he was in dire straits and these enemies
[45:21] coming up on the border things are
[45:24] happening in the kingdom is jeopardy and
[45:27] here you are and the one man you could
[45:30] depend upon who was really the king the
[45:33] nation would either rise or fall because
[45:35] of the King if the King was godly the
[45:38] nation flourished if the King was
[45:39] ungodly it fell into ruin so here was
[45:42] the one that and no doubt you know as
[45:44] like in any royal court there's
[45:47] different ones it's like politics
[45:48] different ones are trying to hold this
[45:50] sway over the king and have it as
[45:51] influence and get his peerage and
[45:54] different things and so there's always
[45:55] different things going on a court hears
[45:57] the prophet of God he's trying to stand
[45:58] in this and King Uzziah well Isaiah had
[46:02] confidence in him well at least he's
[46:03] standing but then he fell in his own
[46:06] accord so now here comes you sire I mean
[46:08] so here comes Isaiah he's in dire
[46:10] straight and he goes down to the temple
[46:13] I doubt very much he was cheerful that
[46:15] day he had a burden now Lord what's
[46:18] happened God God needed that to happen
[46:21] because Isaiah was going to write 66
[46:24] books of the you know there's 66
[46:26] chapters in Isaiah and he and he goes
[46:28] from before there was anything to the
[46:30] end it's like the Bible within a book
[46:32] but God had to get him to one side to
[46:35] reveal himself to the prophet so he
[46:37] couldn't lean on the king any more God
[46:39] had to bring him out from that influence
[46:41] that influence had to die in order for a
[46:43] heavily influenced to come and it's the
[46:46] same thing with you and I friends we
[46:47] need a heavenly influence more than just
[46:50] human influence upon us but God has to
[46:53] influence us because you'll be
[46:55] influenced by two powers God or the
[46:57] devil
[46:57] it depends who you want to be influenced
[46:59] by and I would personally be God
[47:01] influenced me my years of living God's
[47:04] keep part of history and influenced me
[47:06] hallelujah so now here he was and he was
[47:09] under he was he was he was
[47:11] and he was trouble then he went to the
[47:13] temple he went to the best place and he
[47:15] began to pray and I doubt very much he
[47:17] expected what he experienced I mean but
[47:20] he went to a familiar place but
[47:22] something unfamiliar happened isn't it
[47:24] strange using the temple of something
[47:25] unfamiliar happened to him God came down
[47:27] God came into the temple God came out of
[47:30] us and to his temple revealed himself
[47:32] where he should reveal himself that's
[47:35] the same thing here friends this is
[47:37] God's house we gather to worship God we
[47:39] don't gather here just to go through a
[47:41] human system of religion and sing our
[47:43] songs and say our prayers and go outside
[47:46] we come here to be in contact with God
[47:49] Almighty that Jesus would come and meet
[47:51] with us probably and I'm glad Jesus
[47:54] meets with us in this place I mean by
[47:56] the thing as the devil tries to distract
[47:58] us and and trouble us and we get caught
[48:01] up in life let's throw it off amen amen
[48:05] I think we should just push possible
[48:08] that's why I say I mean you say I was
[48:10] was pushed out of one side so God could
[48:13] get a hold of Isaiah and God could speak
[48:15] to him and it was more than just him
[48:17] learning the five books of Moses God
[48:19] spoke to him amen and he saw he saw the
[48:23] Lord High and lifted up ask you could
[48:26] are singing no they what must have been
[48:28] like to be Ezekiel he's in captivity
[48:30] they see stir he sees the cherubims and
[48:34] he sees the Lord upon his throne there
[48:38] he is he's bi you know it became a
[48:39] probably a familiar place he's in
[48:41] captivity this as we were going to live
[48:42] it became familiar I think God came into
[48:45] a familiar place to him and God spoke to
[48:47] him I wonder what it would have been
[48:48] like you wouldn't have been the
[48:50] different I mean you wouldn't have been
[48:51] the same after being in that kind of
[48:54] presence you would have been the same
[48:56] and I'll say friends that same God is
[48:58] present that same God is here that same
[49:02] God is among us I mean they're same God
[49:04] has to meet our needs I mean in the word
[49:06] the Bible the message will become flesh
[49:08] in you and I I mean we don't serve an
[49:10] idea or cunningly devised fables of man
[49:13] we serve the true and living God
[49:15] hallelujah but he wants to get us to a
[49:17] place where he can influence us amen
[49:20] amen
[49:22] now many times God
[49:25] actually use hardship to get our
[49:26] attention let's go to Psalms 51 51 51
[49:49] we're all very familiar with it it was
[49:52] David wrote it after after he thought he
[49:55] had gotten away with you know committing
[49:58] adultery with Bathsheba having her
[50:00] husband killed we are told that Nathan
[50:04] the prophet comes to King David two
[50:06] years after he had but Bathsheba's
[50:10] husband killed Uriah
[50:11] two years later he thought he got away
[50:13] with it but in the Prophet comes to him
[50:15] and tells him a story there's two men in
[50:17] the kingdom one had many sheep one had
[50:20] one then the man with many sheep had a
[50:23] guest coming he took the one sheep from
[50:25] the one man killed it and fitted to his
[50:26] guest and the kings because the King
[50:29] doesn't like in Justice's blood begins
[50:30] to boil he says that man should die and
[50:32] the prophet point that I'm saying you're
[50:34] the man you took you took Bathsheba's
[50:37] you had many he took his one and you had
[50:39] him killed
[50:40] and he and and and he realized he had
[50:44] done it and the reason he had done it is
[50:46] because he began his heart begin to
[50:48] wonder from God he began to stop
[50:50] fighting battles he sat back in a in a
[50:53] relaxed way and as in his palace and he
[50:56] began to wander we can wander we can be
[51:00] sitting in church and be wandering
[51:02] walking around I pray Lord let's not
[51:05] wander may our hearts be stayed on thee
[51:08] the here he is he says have mercy upon
[51:11] me have we all got it open Isaiah I mean
[51:14] Psalms 51 verse 1 have mercy upon me O
[51:17] God according to thy loving-kindness
[51:19] according unto the multitude of thy
[51:22] tender mercies blot out my
[51:24] transgressions wash me thoroughly from
[51:26] my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I
[51:29] acknowledge my transgressions my sin is
[51:32] ever before me against me I mean sorry
[51:36] against the the only have I sinned and
[51:38] done
[51:38] evil in my sight that thou mightest be
[51:41] justified when now speakers and be clear
[51:44] when thou judgest behold I was shapen in
[51:47] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[51:49] conceive me behold thou desirest truth
[51:52] in the inward parts and in the hidden
[51:55] part now a sharp make me to know wisdom
[51:58] purge me with hyssop and I shall be
[52:01] clean wash me and I will be whiter than
[52:03] snow make me to hear joy and gladness
[52:06] that the bones which thou has broken may
[52:10] rejoice it's going to stop right there
[52:13] brother Brown tells a story he says
[52:14] shepherds would break when a lamb would
[52:17] stray the ship would would break its leg
[52:19] and then heal it and in that and that
[52:23] sheep would stay close and the reason he
[52:25] said the Shepherd does that is because
[52:27] he wants to show the love for the Sheep
[52:28] because the sheep's train that's right
[52:30] here in the scripture because David as
[52:35] acquainting him being because we know
[52:39] with Bathsheba the child they had the
[52:41] first job they had died the son died he
[52:44] equates that with a bone bring broken
[52:47] but he's equated what happened to him
[52:50] weh wrote the psalm as God actually
[52:52] broke a bone the bone that make me to
[52:56] hear joy and gladness at the bones which
[52:58] thou has broken may rejoice he following
[53:03] what I'm saying so he's actually saying
[53:04] that his heart was wandering and he
[53:07] caused him to sin and do this great evil
[53:09] and then God allowed it as like a bone
[53:12] was broken that now he could actually
[53:13] come back to God and God too could could
[53:16] restore him restore the jaws of your
[53:19] other salvation creighton he McLean huh
[53:21] God knows how to get our attention but
[53:24] are we are we listening when he's trying
[53:26] to get our attention because sometimes
[53:28] he'll he'll bring hardship and he's
[53:31] actually trying to get you to come back
[53:33] sometimes hardship comes and you got to
[53:35] plow through it because you got to know
[53:36] who you are you following me sometimes
[53:39] you hate we all know when we're carnal
[53:42] we all know we're mr. Fleishman mr.
[53:46] flesh man is wandering around very much
[53:48] alive we know don't we here
[53:50] is watch at world but we also know when
[53:54] God is alive and flesh man is dead and
[53:56] we also know when the devil's trying to
[53:58] push us back and push us down hallelujah
[54:01] we know that and it's the most times
[54:03] we're going to know who we are and who
[54:05] God is and we've been sent to this earth
[54:07] who have been commissioned we're being
[54:09] called I meant to take a word to the
[54:11] four corners of the earth and we may as
[54:13] well start a next door right we're here
[54:16] now there's the scripture is full of
[54:25] times when man steps into the prints of
[54:27] Almighty God it's often in desperate
[54:30] circumstances drive from there we read
[54:33] about Isaiah we read you know we could
[54:37] read even about the Apostle Paul he say
[54:39] well that wasn't desperate yeah in a
[54:41] different way it was desperate he was
[54:42] filled with anger he wanted to go wipe
[54:45] out the Christians he went on the road
[54:47] to Damascus everything against him was
[54:49] against the true and living God and he
[54:51] didn't know it but there he was but then
[54:53] he met the very God he learnt about he
[54:56] knew a lot about Jehovah but then he met
[54:58] Jehovah and it's two very different
[55:00] things when you learn about him and then
[55:02] you meet him and then he meets he meets
[55:05] the actually the God he was fighting
[55:07] which was Jesus a min which was in the
[55:09] first church he met him on the road to
[55:11] Damascus and then that was a very
[55:13] different kind of experience are you
[55:16] following me I just say let's go beyond
[55:19] just just going through the motion let's
[55:22] go beyond it I mean I'm not reading the
[55:25] yo-yo we read the scripture something
[55:28] else should say that's for you that's
[55:29] for me he's the same God he's not a
[55:32] different God he's not someone else's
[55:34] God he's here to be met hallelujah he's
[55:39] the same God in the Old Testament as
[55:41] years and than you now we have a lot of
[55:46] sometimes well actually often you know
[55:49] the devil is always here to fight us
[55:50] always he's the first one in church and
[55:53] he's the last one to leave
[55:55] amen he is he's here to fight you
[55:58] he's here to withstand you he said
[56:00] withstand you coming to your position
[56:03] Amy it's just like it says in the book
[56:05] of we weren't turned up I think it's a
[56:06] Cariah it says there's the High
[56:09] Priestess tyranny and and he's in dirty
[56:12] garments and the Devils on his right
[56:14] hand to withstand him and then the angel
[56:16] the Lord that comes and and rebukes the
[56:18] devil he leaves and then the high priest
[56:20] comers that change from duty governments
[56:22] to to clean high priest garments so the
[56:25] devil was there to withstand the high
[56:27] priest coming to his position as the
[56:28] same thing with you and I the devil's
[56:30] here to withstand us and to fight us and
[56:33] to tell us it's not yours it's our land
[56:35] it's our promise
[56:37] it's our inheritance amen
[56:40] Allu yeah so we should withstand the
[56:44] devil he says withstand the devil and he
[56:47] will flee he shall he shall flee thought
[56:50] he might flee he shall yet it was stand
[56:52] him yeah and he shall flee from you amen
[56:56] he's come here to rob destroy and kill
[56:58] now sometimes sometimes we come to a
[57:02] place where God can be walking right
[57:04] with us and we don't know it yeah and
[57:06] then this resurrection now that's very
[57:08] much true you go to Luke chapter 24 and
[57:13] you know the you know the scripture they
[57:16] were in a familiar place there in
[57:18] Jerusalem else familiar the Messiah had
[57:21] been crucified he was in the tomb they
[57:25] saw him go to Calvary they saw him hang
[57:27] there on the cross they heard him say
[57:30] Father forgive them they don't know what
[57:31] they do they saw him said and father
[57:33] into thy hands I commit my spirit they
[57:35] saw him die and they felt the earthquake
[57:38] they saw the Eclipse they saw all those
[57:41] things and they saw his body be put into
[57:44] the tomb and they saw it sealed up and
[57:46] here they were and they're waiting for
[57:49] the day after the Sabbath the day after
[57:52] the Sabbath the Sunday the Resurrection
[57:55] Day they don't know it was a
[57:56] resurrection day even though Jesus told
[57:58] them many times that he'd be given to
[58:01] the hands of sinful men be crucified the
[58:03] third day he'll raise again he told them
[58:05] that he told them the promise of the
[58:07] hour but it was it didn't quite sink in
[58:10] because they were too caught up with
[58:12] what they saw what they were used to you
[58:16] know
[58:16] I tell you the rapture will be something
[58:19] we're not used to the body change will
[58:23] be something that we won't be used to
[58:25] it'll be a very different kind of moment
[58:27] and a twinkling of an eye these atoms
[58:29] are going to be changed it'll be
[58:31] something we have not experienced I
[58:33] don't know where we'll be we could be
[58:35] you know and beard we could be here
[58:39] that'd be wonderful wouldn't it
[58:41] Oh actually on our way to work Monday
[58:43] morning only they can be Vanessa but you
[58:46] know we could be anywhere then there's
[58:50] gonna be you know before we even realize
[58:52] it
[58:52] and so there they were there are in a
[58:55] familiar place but unfamiliar things
[58:57] were happening and then they went to the
[58:59] tomb the woman went to the tomb first
[59:01] now what I'm talking to you about is
[59:03] more than a story right it's a prophecy
[59:06] brother Brown says modern events are
[59:09] made clear by prophecy and he goes to
[59:11] Luke chapter 24 and he says that that's
[59:14] the the death burial resurrection is a
[59:16] prophecy and a prophecy has to be
[59:19] fulfilled a prophecy as speaking of
[59:22] future events that will happen and
[59:25] people will live out those events right
[59:28] people got because because when God
[59:30] speaks a prophecy like for example he
[59:33] knew Moses would be Moses going down to
[59:35] Egypt but in but when he gave the
[59:38] promise to Abraham Moses hasn't
[59:40] mentioned his particular name is not
[59:43] spoken in the prophecy but God in his
[59:46] mind sees Moses is going to take that
[59:48] role God's like a great director he's
[59:50] got a script and he knows who his actors
[59:53] are going to be when when when when
[59:56] Isaiah prophesied the voice of one
[59:58] crying in the wilderness
[59:59] it didn't say John the Baptist will be
[1:00:03] the voice but he was the act of
[1:00:05] fulfilling that role when God spoke that
[1:00:08] forth in his mind he saw John standing
[1:00:11] on the riverbank as the voice crying in
[1:00:12] the wilderness hallelujah when there's
[1:00:15] the prophecy he shall be a light to the
[1:00:17] Gentiles
[1:00:18] that was Jesus but also Paul's ministry
[1:00:20] Paul said I'm a light to the Gentiles so
[1:00:23] when God spoke that forth in God's mind
[1:00:25] he saw Paul hallelujah so God has actors
[1:00:29] in his mind he knows you
[1:00:30] gonna fulfill a-- they just speaks of
[1:00:32] forth and then at its season and lives
[1:00:34] aloo you and so now here we are let's go
[1:00:39] back there let's go back to thee the
[1:00:42] prophecy
[1:00:43] it was the Messiah amen he was there
[1:00:48] they were believers they were there
[1:00:51] right there was the rejecters the
[1:00:56] scoffers the mockers the critics the
[1:00:58] indifferent they were there they were
[1:01:01] there they're in a familiar place let's
[1:01:04] go see how the how the believers were
[1:01:07] they were down they had questions they
[1:01:10] weren't sure exactly what was going on
[1:01:12] but they were there they were looking
[1:01:15] for him and what he was used to be like
[1:01:18] but he was an hour in a different form
[1:01:20] and now he is walking with them he is
[1:01:23] walking with the two on the way to
[1:01:24] Emmaus let's go before that he was with
[1:01:26] he he wasn't there in the tomb that
[1:01:29] believers go to the tomb where he was
[1:01:31] they saw him go in it as a dead form
[1:01:34] wrapped up sealed-up tomb they come back
[1:01:37] a few days later where is he gone and
[1:01:39] marries they're saying where have you
[1:01:40] laid him that I can carry him away and
[1:01:42] they took spirit as spices to anoint his
[1:01:45] body then you all about death and spices
[1:01:47] and burying people but then know too
[1:01:49] much about someone who died who came
[1:01:51] back to life on the ruin of court
[1:01:53] because Jesus says I lay my life down
[1:01:55] and I'll take it back up again I've
[1:01:57] never seen that happen they saw Lazarus
[1:01:59] come out of the grave but the
[1:02:00] resurrection the life called him forth
[1:02:02] but now they are going to see the
[1:02:03] resurrection life bring himself back
[1:02:05] back to life hallelujah
[1:02:06] under his own power and then so here she
[1:02:09] is and she turns around and she sees a
[1:02:11] young man thinks it's a gardener here he
[1:02:14] is where have you taken him that I can
[1:02:17] carry him away this is her burden
[1:02:19] where's the Messiah that I want to
[1:02:21] anoint with spices he's dead but he
[1:02:23] wasn't dead he is alive he was alive and
[1:02:26] then so then she just said one word Mary
[1:02:28] and her eyes came open it's you rabbi
[1:02:32] hallelujah that changed her whole life
[1:02:34] amen
[1:02:36] it was a familiar place but God did an
[1:02:39] unexpected familiar thing
[1:02:42] amen and then and then and then that
[1:02:45] happens she runs tells the disciples and
[1:02:47] there's two disciples walking on the way
[1:02:49] to Emmaus they're not rejoicing that the
[1:02:52] whole life is falling apart they had
[1:02:54] invested everything with this Jesus of
[1:02:56] Nazareth they had burned every Bridge
[1:02:58] they're following this man and now he
[1:03:00] had been crucified he had done nothing
[1:03:02] wrong but he had been crucified the the
[1:03:04] church treasurer committed suicide Judas
[1:03:07] right and The ministers were held up in
[1:03:09] some place and they were going back to
[1:03:10] Emmaus this is where they were and they
[1:03:14] were going down a familiar path
[1:03:16] something unexpected happened the main
[1:03:19] thing is they are talking about what God
[1:03:21] was doing in their day and when you talk
[1:03:23] about him in your day that's when he
[1:03:26] draws near one who draw near don't you
[1:03:30] want him to come that's why it's so
[1:03:32] important you want to think on the right
[1:03:36] things ponder ponder those things in
[1:03:39] your heart like Mary did talk talk about
[1:03:42] what he's doing in this day amen and
[1:03:46] then and then he begins to walk with
[1:03:48] them and they didn't recognize because
[1:03:50] he was in another form that they didn't
[1:03:52] recognize and then now they begin to
[1:03:55] actually try and fill him in he says why
[1:03:59] you said what you said what as if he
[1:04:01] didn't know amen as if he didn't know
[1:04:04] and then and then they said oh you know
[1:04:07] this this Jesus of Nazareth we believe
[1:04:09] to be a yo we believed he was the
[1:04:10] Prophet and the other Messiah but now
[1:04:12] he's dead he's been he's been crucified
[1:04:14] and now his body's been taken somewhere
[1:04:17] and people says he's alive and we don't
[1:04:19] know and he begins to say Oh fools and
[1:04:21] slow of heart to believe and then he
[1:04:24] starts at Moses and he goes all the way
[1:04:27] down to the scripture and he says did he
[1:04:30] do this was he like a prophet like unto
[1:04:32] Moses and was he you know what you know
[1:04:36] was he was he crucified or killed
[1:04:38] between two male factors he goes through
[1:04:40] all of the scriptures concerning him and
[1:04:42] it's more than a Bible study it's more
[1:04:47] than learning something the Messiah is
[1:04:49] there trying to get them to see where
[1:04:51] they are in the scripture I mean to try
[1:04:55] and get him to see
[1:04:56] they are in the script to show them what
[1:04:58] the next scene is going to be and the
[1:05:01] scenes that have been hallelujah that
[1:05:03] they don't try and start in the opening
[1:05:05] scene that's already done and the
[1:05:07] closing scene as well from the future
[1:05:09] but we're but he's trying to show them
[1:05:11] what pages are on right now and it's the
[1:05:13] same thing here friends and then and
[1:05:15] then here they were they you know they
[1:05:17] walked for six hours with him and he and
[1:05:21] he's telling everything about himself in
[1:05:23] the scripture then they come to one of
[1:05:24] their houses and then he he goes as if
[1:05:27] he's going to keep walking on but they
[1:05:29] constrain him to come in we're going to
[1:05:32] constrain Jesus to come and Amy got to
[1:05:35] constrain him stay with me don't walk on
[1:05:39] come in with me hey they weren't even
[1:05:41] sure who he was and he's a personal God
[1:05:43] he's a person he's not an idea he's a
[1:05:46] living being and then so they yeah and
[1:05:48] then they constrain to come in and then
[1:05:50] they sit down and then they're about to
[1:05:52] have a meal and the one who's the head
[1:05:54] of the house normally breaks the bread
[1:05:56] they placed him as the head of the house
[1:05:58] and he broke the bread and their eyes
[1:06:01] came open because he did something that
[1:06:02] he did before his crucifixion they
[1:06:04] realized Lord it's you and he
[1:06:06] disappeared and in a six hour walk
[1:06:09] became a one hour sprint or hardened to
[1:06:11] however long they ran back to tell the
[1:06:13] rest of them he's risen he's risen and
[1:06:17] that's what we need to really tell each
[1:06:19] other he's risen he's alive he's present
[1:06:23] I met him the other day he spoke to me
[1:06:26] he quickened his word to my soul he's a
[1:06:28] living God he's present here olia
[1:06:32] because there's not a God of history
[1:06:34] he's not an idea he's a person to meet
[1:06:38] hallelujah and then so now brother Bram
[1:06:41] comes down and he says now that's a
[1:06:43] prophecy and we're now living out the
[1:06:46] fulfillment of the prophecy I mean when
[1:06:48] the Messiah comes upon the scene the Son
[1:06:51] of Man is revealed the hope it means
[1:06:53] something to you and he takes a profit
[1:06:55] vessel and he speaks through that vessel
[1:06:57] amen and to God's elected they hear the
[1:07:00] voice behind the voice it becomes more
[1:07:02] than just tapes and books and I trust
[1:07:04] it's not common to anyone I trust has
[1:07:07] never become common well I've been
[1:07:08] raised in
[1:07:09] when did it quicken you alive when did
[1:07:11] it speak to your heart and become a
[1:07:13] living reality where it's not some
[1:07:15] something stale or some information but
[1:07:17] it becomes a living word amen to you
[1:07:19] personally he says now we are living
[1:07:22] that these modern events around us and
[1:07:25] made clear by Luke 24 amen hallelujah
[1:07:29] we've seen now I know I know I spoke
[1:07:33] this at our first camp but we've seen
[1:07:36] people crucify him we've been down I'm
[1:07:40] just gonna count here we are wherever
[1:07:42] this goes it'll go we've been
[1:07:44] discouraged we've been down have we not
[1:07:48] we've been hurt we've been disappointed
[1:07:52] yeah
[1:07:53] we've been wondering what's going on and
[1:07:56] if we just went back into the scripture
[1:07:59] and said actually that was a prophecy
[1:08:01] and now it's got to be lived out
[1:08:03] hallelujah and we're living it out and
[1:08:06] you find yourself as the actors of those
[1:08:09] who are about to go to the upper room
[1:08:11] amen to receive the Holy Ghost now we
[1:08:15] know we've already received the Holy
[1:08:16] Ghost oh I trust you have but it's all
[1:08:19] part of Resurrection season it wasn't
[1:08:21] just Jesus came out of the tomb when the
[1:08:24] windows the day of Pentecost they were
[1:08:25] once dead in trespasses and sin even
[1:08:28] though they are following the Son of Man
[1:08:29] but on the day of Pentecost they came
[1:08:32] alive they were quickened by the same
[1:08:34] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:08:36] came and dwelt in them and quicken them
[1:08:38] they became living witnesses of the
[1:08:40] resurrection
[1:08:41] hallelujah and this is what we have
[1:08:43] become the Upper Room you know there's
[1:08:51] many places where we can look in the
[1:08:53] scripture where people are in familiar
[1:08:56] places and God comes in an unexpected
[1:08:59] way and you got to be looking for it
[1:09:02] right we've got to look beyond well this
[1:09:07] is church and this is Wednesday and you
[1:09:10] know yes we got to look beyond it what
[1:09:14] to expect you know when we come through
[1:09:16] the doors or when we close our eyes for
[1:09:18] a word of Prayer even for just the food
[1:09:20] and the morning we should expect
[1:09:22] to come down and God to meet it with us
[1:09:25] and God to commune with us and God to
[1:09:28] speak to us
[1:09:29] shouldn't we hey man yes amen I'm glad
[1:09:34] we have a God of the present hallelujah
[1:09:37] now this always say you're the right
[1:09:43] approach to God and and I'll just close
[1:09:46] with these statements but the woman who
[1:09:49] touched the hem of His garment had to
[1:09:50] reach down and touch his touch the hem
[1:09:52] of His garment she had to come and
[1:09:54] humility to get what she needed the
[1:09:57] woman with the alabaster box had to come
[1:09:59] to a place where she didn't care what
[1:10:01] everyone else thought of her him what
[1:10:03] she was doing she wasn't invited to that
[1:10:05] party but she knew that someone had to
[1:10:08] do him a service someone had to anoint
[1:10:10] him someone had to make him welcome and
[1:10:12] no one else did so she thought I'm going
[1:10:14] to take everything she render she saw
[1:10:18] hell I don't know how she saw but she
[1:10:20] looked at and saw how he was treated and
[1:10:21] she's seen within herself that is not
[1:10:23] right I'm not gonna let those cold
[1:10:26] formal religious people treat the
[1:10:29] Messiah like that so she ran back to her
[1:10:32] house and she didn't just get a little
[1:10:34] bit of petty cash
[1:10:35] she got Oliver earning and it didn't
[1:10:38] matter how she ended jesus knew what she
[1:10:40] had done but he wasn't he wasn't worried
[1:10:43] about that she was coming to give an
[1:10:45] offering hallelujah and then as she went
[1:10:48] she got the alabaster box I trust it's
[1:10:51] more than a story I trust you can say
[1:10:53] I've been there I've been there I've
[1:10:55] given my Omen held back a little bit of
[1:10:57] a safety deposit under my mattress she
[1:10:59] grabbed all of her cash out Adam under
[1:11:01] the mattress ran to the Apothecary no
[1:11:04] you're no doubt the Apothecary guy said
[1:11:06] yo took one look at her oh it's you
[1:11:08] again you know what do you want she
[1:11:12] points up to maybe some fancy talk thing
[1:11:14] I want that one that one what are you
[1:11:17] gonna pay with her worth puts all the
[1:11:19] money on the desk by thinking I know how
[1:11:22] you got that stuff
[1:11:23] she didn't care you got to come to a
[1:11:26] place where you don't care what others
[1:11:29] think what others are doing I mean I
[1:11:31] don't worry what others are doing God
[1:11:33] what are you doing what are you moving
[1:11:35] me
[1:11:35] to do and then so she would have got the
[1:11:37] box she bought it she ran in she didn't
[1:11:40] ask permission she asked permission of
[1:11:43] Simon the Pharisee or now she just went
[1:11:45] in broke the alabaster box anointed
[1:11:48] anointed his feet you know took her here
[1:11:52] and and and and and and whipped on his
[1:11:54] feet took his feet by her hands and
[1:11:56] whipped on them washed them with her
[1:11:57] tears and then what wiped his feet what
[1:12:00] his feet with her here
[1:12:02] hallelujah and the prophets is that the
[1:12:05] smell of Jesus got honor by her by her
[1:12:08] washing his feet hallelujah I trust the
[1:12:12] smell of Jesus gets on us
[1:12:14] I mean Yana said well I'm saying the
[1:12:17] smell of his feet got upon her
[1:12:19] hallelujah and then and then jesus said
[1:12:21] to her thigh sins are forgiven go in
[1:12:24] peace amen
[1:12:26] she was not she was determined maybe it
[1:12:31] was a familiar place for I don't know
[1:12:32] she knew how to get in but an unexpected
[1:12:36] thing drove her to it
[1:12:37] and she and she and she broke the
[1:12:39] alabaster box on her and anointed him
[1:12:41] did him a service King David had three
[1:12:45] mighty men he was he was there was full
[1:12:49] Philistine Garrison's around Bethlehem
[1:12:52] and her soul longs for the water of
[1:12:56] Bethlehem and he just said oh my he
[1:12:59] didn't make it command he said oh I wish
[1:13:01] I could drink from that well that I
[1:13:03] drank from when I was young and these
[1:13:05] three mighty men they just something in
[1:13:08] them just said our king wants a drink
[1:13:10] and the water he is not going to do any
[1:13:12] good he wants that well there well you

[1:13:17] well and something in them said let's go

[1:13:22] their weapons and they had one purpose

[1:13:26] paths are all indifference cuts are all
[1:13:29] strife and worry and tomorrow and

[1:13:35] all and they got a drink because their
[1:13:38] burden was my king needs a fresh drink
[1:13:40] hallelujah and then they filled up the
[1:13:42] bucket and they killed their way 1 2 3
[1:13:45] they kill I don't know how many they
[1:13:46] killed but what
[1:13:47] enemy got in their way discouragement

[1:13:56] negative thoughts whatever maybe they
[1:13:58] cut down everyone hallelujah brother

[1:15:42] total victory over my enemy hallelujah
[1:15:46] and he did that he went and he got back
[1:15:48] everything that was his how about you
[1:15:51] you're the first Church age it says I
[1:15:54] have one thing yes because thou has left
[1:15:56] thy first love now if you leave
[1:16:00] something
[1:16:01] it's your responsibility to go get it
[1:16:03] it's like thou has left our keys thy
[1:16:06] Keys thou has left he said well they
[1:16:09] might need to go find them I can't
[1:16:11] function without them thou has left our
[1:16:16] phone and I'm using very silly
[1:16:18] illustrations but if you have left your
[1:16:20] phone you had it at one time but you've
[1:16:22] walked on left it somewhere so you've
[1:16:25] got to go get it back right now we're
[1:16:29] living in a time friends where where we
[1:16:33] have restored back to the original
[1:16:35] Pentecost not a zoo sir Street Pentecost
[1:16:38] but the original Pentecost the original
[1:16:40] Pentecost was God was and his people and
[1:16:42] his fullness right before the ephesian
[1:16:45] church age really said and there was a
[1:16:47] period of time where they weren't in a
[1:16:49] church age anymore I mean hadn't even
[1:16:51] gone into one year they hadn't left
[1:16:53] their first love yet right the
[1:16:55] Antichrist spirit hadn't come in with
[1:16:57] just deeds but they had they had godness
[1:17:01] fullness and the enemy wasn't there yet
[1:17:03] in that way we are here we are living in
[1:17:10] a time of restoration we're living at a
[1:17:13] time when God is present we're living in
[1:17:15] a time where all things are ours by
[1:17:18] Jesus Christ we're living in a time
[1:17:20] where we don't have to sit back and say
[1:17:22] well that someone else's testimony God
[1:17:24] don't do those things over more because
[1:17:26] God does everything now right he's still
[1:17:29] a healer he's still a redeemer he's
[1:17:31] still an outpour of a lot of his holy
[1:17:33] spirit he's still a transformer he still
[1:17:36] makes people scream and shout and live
[1:17:38] right after their that's happened to
[1:17:40] them he still births people into the
[1:17:41] kingdom acts 2:38 youngins ms real
[1:17:44] Christmas the church world thinks they
[1:17:46] are
[1:17:46] he still bristle because that's the only
[1:17:49] ones the word can produce as acts 2:38
[1:17:53] screaming crying shouting whooping
[1:17:55] youngins
[1:17:57] hallelujah glorious creatures I think
[1:17:59] they are hallelujah but the main thing
[1:18:02] is you had a look at what your life was
[1:18:04] after you met him and you and and and if
[1:18:07] your life is transformed and you're
[1:18:09] living by the Word of God overcoming
[1:18:10] every day then you met the right guy and
[1:18:13] you've got the right experience
[1:18:14] but we shouldn't sit back and be worried
[1:18:16] about formalism and try to keep all
[1:18:19] things together the devil is a you know
[1:18:21] you going to a graveyard we've gone to
[1:18:25] our Art Gallery and it's just a bunch of
[1:18:28] statues right not well even modern
[1:18:32] artists statues or graveyards just
[1:18:35] tombstones there's no life there it's
[1:18:37] all dead right that's what the devil
[1:18:39] wants to make people he wants to make it
[1:18:41] like it's a morgue amen but we're not
[1:18:44] embalmed with with with preservative
[1:18:46] we're embalmed with bolt and bars for
[1:18:49] another over but we're be transfused
[1:18:50] with the blood of God to bring life and
[1:18:54] joy and Thanksgiving and reality of his
[1:18:57] word heaven hallelujah huh you know
[1:19:00] receiving the Holy Ghost is not just you
[1:19:02] have an idea now I haven't hey man what
[1:19:04] good would the what do you think we
[1:19:06] would have a book of Acts Church if they
[1:19:09] set up there and they said well it's
[1:19:10] nine days brethren I think we've got it
[1:19:12] now I really believe we've got it
[1:19:14] didn't you feel nice after you you know
[1:19:16] they said no wait Jesus said wait till
[1:19:20] her and Jude from power from on high
[1:19:22] and they didn't know necessarily what
[1:19:24] they're looking for
[1:19:26] Jesus didn't say now on the day of
[1:19:28] Pentecost the the pillar of fire is
[1:19:32] going to come into the room and he's
[1:19:33] going to separate himself upon it my
[1:19:35] spirit is going to come and dwell that
[1:19:37] way in you and you're gonna act like a
[1:19:38] bunch of drunk people and Peter's gonna
[1:19:41] stand him and say this is that spoken by
[1:19:42] the Prophet Joel he didn't explain it
[1:19:44] that way he just said wait
[1:19:46] he just said wait and they waited for
[1:19:49] the reality and the reality came and
[1:19:52] they set the world on fire
[1:19:55] hallelujah and if your whole heart is
[1:19:57] now given over to him Simon the sorcerer
[1:20:01] he didn't receive the Holy Ghost because
[1:20:03] he wanted the Holy Ghost for money he
[1:20:06] got baptized he was walking with the
[1:20:08] believers but he was actually honest
[1:20:10] can I buy this this is not working for
[1:20:13] me
[1:20:14] because this whole heart wasn't given
[1:20:17] over to the Lord he wanted to use it for
[1:20:19] his own ambition and that's why he
[1:20:21] didn't receive it right brother Aaron
[1:20:23] tells us stories like a boxcar
[1:20:25] it gets packed up and
[1:20:28] I'll just use a shipping container I
[1:20:30] think boxcar some people might not know
[1:20:32] what a boxcars a shipping container you
[1:20:34] pack it right and then it's sealed up
[1:20:38] right it's locked it's sealed and sent
[1:20:42] to its destination but first that
[1:20:44] shipping container has to be checked has
[1:20:46] it been packed right if it's packed
[1:20:49] wrong then all the goods can be broken
[1:20:50] and then all it is is a call to the
[1:20:53] insurance company this is broken right
[1:20:56] so it's going to be packed right and
[1:20:57] when it's packed right then the seals
[1:20:59] put on and then it's sealed until it
[1:21:01] gets to its destination and no one can
[1:21:03] break that seal until it gets there it's
[1:21:07] the same thing with the Holy Ghost the
[1:21:09] Holy Ghost comes and inspects our lives
[1:21:11] and when we're packed right well how you
[1:21:14] packed right you got to give everything
[1:21:16] you are to him all of your ambition all
[1:21:18] of your hopes and plans all of your
[1:21:20] desires
[1:21:21] you can't hold you do not have something
[1:21:24] in reserve I mean you can't have
[1:21:27] anything in reserve and say lord I give
[1:21:28] you my heart but this part of me I'll
[1:21:30] keep like a way out or a exit or
[1:21:33] something you know if this doesn't work
[1:21:35] I'll try this no you can't do that
[1:21:37] you've got to jump in yeah amen who's
[1:21:40] ever been on a really high place and
[1:21:42] jumped into some water and there's that
[1:21:44] brief second
[1:21:45] we're like should I should I should I
[1:21:48] should but then once you do you know you
[1:21:50] can't stop because you've jumped you owe
[1:21:53] you you've jumped your whole self in
[1:21:55] it's too late I mean you're now you know
[1:21:58] falling you can't you can't you know
[1:22:00] that same thing with the Lord you can't
[1:22:04] just you know you can't have a rope tied
[1:22:06] to you and then say now I'm going to
[1:22:08] jump and you actually kind of abseiling
[1:22:11] down no you can't do that you've got to
[1:22:13] jump you've got to give your whole self
[1:22:16] every part of you you have to surrender
[1:22:19] to him if you seek me with my your whole
[1:22:22] heart then you shall find me not was
[1:22:25] just a little bit of yourself well

[1:22:29] it seems like a good idea and you know
[1:22:31] maybe mommy and daddy might like me more
[1:22:33] so give it a go no you've got to jump
[1:22:35] man you've got to jump and once you jump

[1:22:41] hey I never regretted it I don't mean
