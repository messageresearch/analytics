light will shine amen he's good all the time hallelujah amen if you want to have your seats this morning and um just uh those that are sharing testimony um for the Youth Camp would could could come forth and prepare yourselves amen do we want to use this we'll just leave you kind of think you wouldn't be nervous speaking to people you ignore so well but anyway um my testimony comes from before the camp even because after we had our camp in February man it was just tough I was down just I can't even explain it but it was just a really bad time for me and I just couldn't get out of it and I didn't know why or what and I know you get attacked but man it was just carrying on and then I know brother Kyra digs had heard one of his sermons and he said if you're going through a trial the worst thing to do is to surround yourself with negative people and so um I didn't experience that but it started with sister Shannon where we had the barbecue and she asked us all to give a testimony and that just started breaking that feeling that I was having because it was so good just to hear about what the Lord had been doing for people and so that brought to remembrance what brother kidra had preached because then it made sense why don't surround yourself with that negativity anyway so um we went to the camp and in the car I was still thinking oh it's a youth camp and then I realized well I can still be touched by the the Lord in the services so it's not to say I'm just going then I can't have an expectation and um I was originally just meant to be a babysitter and the Saturday morning it turned out I became a youth sitter and so just to back check slightly with a couple of weeks our mind had been speaking to me and he said to me do you know how to relax he said you never have fun anymore you never make jokes anymore you work at work you work at home that's all you're doing all the time and I I say it as a joke I didn't really but I was like can I go do the washing you're done yet you know that's how I was feeling and so the Lord just took me that Saturday morning and he kicked me out my comfort zone 100% like I was not prepared to be with the children or the youth I didn't know what to do I didn't know how to handle it and I was just like oh my goodness but the Lord was so faithful and he's just changed so much in me from that youth camp and just being with the children it was just such a blessing and um let me see where am I I've also have new eyes for the Youth I didn't think I would have a burden or not that I didn't like youth but I didn't expect what the lord gave me that weekend and seeing the children though the world is calling to them so loudly and he just gave me a new found burden for them because man it's hard for them and so I just I want to pray for them and I want to reach them and I don't want to the Lord wants to help them and I just see his burden for them and so um I'm appreciative of that as well and there was also one particular person that I didn't get along with very well she just rubed me up the wrong way all the time and afterwards Ouran just brought me to memory and he said you were lost and you were know better than what she might be and at sometimes I think we forget that that we need to have compassion for those people because we were not perfect before either and that maybe there's something there there that's why the Satan was actually trying to keep keep us away so if I ever am allowed in the Lord Wills I will go for another camp and then try and see through different eyes and so um then what happened was when I came home man Monday and Tuesday was the best days I've ever had it was just glorious it was wonderful I haven't been there happy in such a long time and from the Sunday I had an expectation for our Wednesday night meeting I was just like the Lord is just going to be good to us the Wednesday I just know it and I I kept walking it the whole week and Wednesday when I got home Reuben started just rubbing me up the wrong way and it's the first time in my life I've ever been able to do it but I was just like no Wednesday is going to be a blessing nothing is ruining it for me and we went um and ate at the loins before and all the kids were screaming and shouting and rough riding and I was just like it's going to be a good night the Lord is going to bless us it's going to be wonderful and I just kept my focus on him and so now it makes sense with the Lord says focus on him through everything because he did he he did um bring that to pass and I don't know I wrote the poem last night if I can share it and uh I hope it blesses the Lord the walk we walk because we're called to face the trials to meet the Lord to shout and sing in Victory for Jesus my Savior has Set Me Free I pray therefore unto my king to help me spread his Light Within to be filled from the gushing Waters of Life the stream more powerful than any Strife for just as Moses smoke that rock the glory of the Lord came bursting forth not just a trickle or a small stream but a powerful force that none had ever seen for that water was to quench The Thirst of 2 million people in all of their herd in a land that was Barren and dry the Lord in his power brought new life and as the Lord Our God helped the Israelites that day so the Lord is here to fight for us today surrender yourself lay down your life allow the amazing savior to be your one and only light allow the Holy Spirit to flow within then to gush out his grace and mercy to all who sin bring forth healing and Revival in his name for Jesus is forever yesterday today the same so thank you I I had a blessed time it was amazing it was a very fun time at the camp and I um oh yeah they we did a thing when they blindfolded me and I had to follow the voice and eventually I got duct taped to the chair because I listened to the wrong voice that's good enough uh yes the the camp was a blessing um yeah there was uh three three pastors there and was brother Daniel white and then was brother Ben GL and brother ALR Robinson and and they were geared up for the Youth they were there and uh it was just wonderful to see them work and to see them pray and to see the the burden they have for the Youth and then uh I I got all the youth in the the first morning I'm way off my nose but it doesn't matter so I got to say hello to every youth because I had to mark them off to see if they they and so I got to to meet them at day one and I got to meet them on on the Sunday and the Monday when they left home and it was it was sad to see how this world is attacking them and winning and physically winning the battles and and it's and it's real talk and it's it's our youth our young youth here we are blessed brothers and sisters to have them to have fathers and mothers that care and that love them and that pour everything they have into their children and that pray in Timothy it says pray without seizing I cannot say it enough pray for your children and keep his Commandments and be true to him and he will answer your prayer because our kids need they are being attacked by Hollywood they are being attacked by cell phones internet you don't understand this is this is a youth camp and we have to Pride kids away from their cell phones we have to go catch them where they signal the whole time to bring them back to a camp the world is geared up for them and and and it's such a it's such a fine-tuned machine you our enemy is great but God is greater but the reality is he's still out there and he's lurking and he is is like the perfect Predator if you look in Wild in in the wild and it just came to pass last night I was just sitting and I was thinking I looked at the wild it could be the biggest line there is it will go for the weakest it will go for the wounded it will go for the smallest it likes the easy K why should we give it to him you pray for your kids you pray for them and you give them everything you have you live your life you shine your light but you give them everything you have because guess what they are on the menu we fight our burdens we fight our battles but we've got one another we've got understanding we've got wisdom we've got wounds we've been scarred they fresh they're easy Target and all this world needs to do is try to catch them so I'm not saying go legalistic way and lock them in a room I'm saying pray without seizing I'm saying give them everything you can so the seed cuz it was a blessed camp and it opened my eyes I thought message children you know they grow up we've got the truth they'll walk in that light their children just like any other children they get tricked by the same tricks you know the the story of David I want to really share it so the Monday morning uh brother Daniel um put duck duck tap his eyes closed and he said listen to The Voice and so he made an obstacle course in the camp was really really good and he had to climb over ches blindfolded and he did it I we can give him a hand of lost definitely afterwards he climbed over it he listened to the voice the voice said go left he went left the go said go right he went right he listened to the voice and then he got him on stage and for one second cuz David was tired this was a very long long type of trial for him and you know so he was standing on stage very very relaxed and brother vaner sster went up and he took duct tape and he just said to me pulled up his chair and he said please sit down cuz you must be tired and as he sat down he duct taped into the chair and he goes you listen to the wrong voice and it's that easy so while he was waiting on God while he was living the other voice came in and said but why don't you rest a bit because you must be tired you know and and and it was a blessing because it was the Holy Spirit taking over the meeting and that happened it wasn't planned it was just happened and then and then of course brother Daniel went back and and he freed him and he said but God's word God's truth and God's mercy will free us from this but be careful of The Voice voice you listen to and and and so the theme of the camp this I just want to tell you is the theme was whose son is this so I was speaking where David were walking to face Goliath and and Saul looked at um uh at what was the captain of the host and he said to him whose son is that because there was a character in that son that he recognized is not normal that's not the human that's not the every boy out there there is a character facing that giant in the power of God and so our sons that's what I want to ask you our kids as well I want them to ask whose son is that and not my son or your son but the but the Lord's son cuz he doesn't he's not a grandfather he's a father amen and and all of you are sons of God so yeah the the whole Camp was a a life-changing event um I never thought I would love people so much and have fun with them and see so much character those kids got character Godly character in them they just need us to to just rub it and just bring it out and feed it and give it and nourish it and so that the devil can't just distract them because it's so easy so pray for our youth please don't don't stop praying for them and if there's anyone and I and I put it out anyone fathers or sisters that wants to to help with the youth come anytime we don't we won't ref come just be there um even if it's for a skit or it's for a for a musical night for them or a DVD night where we can show them something if you've got any suggestions come we need it they need they need us they really do need us and uh yeah just to end it off I think we can give David a warm hand of Applause because he did so well and we're really proud of him man really proud thank you I think that will be all for the yes you morning everyone um I was just so blessed from the camp at Youth and I just felt that this is the generation that we're in right now and I just felt that God is more stronger today and um um I just really enjoyed it because it's it was just our time this year and I thought me and de could be stronger in character from from that and I found that we have a lot of Trials like during school and all that but since from then we know what we can do to fight the devil and it just so great thank [Applause] [Music] you anyone else okay praise the Lord amen definitely pray for the Youth Hallelujah you hold on we believe amen Our God answers prayer amen we we fight a living we fight a living devil but we serve a living God Amen who is more greater greater

amen well good morning everyone it's good to be home amen um I'm sorry for everyone who is at camp but I'm basically going to preach the same sermon I preached at Camp I just can't get it out of my system I have another sermon here but I just I'm just I just can't escape this so once I get out of my system then I guess guess we can move on but um so let's turn to Leviticus chapter 1 amen so the camp was a blessing it was good to see just it's amazing to see Armand and Shantel just working among the youth and they br down some walls and you know they really did a fantastic job amen you know cuz it's 99% of the time it's not the uh it's it's it's really those times cuz Hey they've sat in church all their life those kids and they've and they've heard probably the the the the word far more than we've had hot dinners you know but it takes that little more amen and normally a lot of those things are broken when it's just fellowship and spending time and you know so it was it was a real joy to see that and yeah so so Lord willing we're going to have another camp at Labor weekend for the Youth and maybe we could bring some slightly older youth as well but we'll see what we can do amen uh Leviticus 1: 1:4 and then we're going to read uh from Genesis 27 and the lordes and out ofac of saying Speak the children sayto them if any of you bring offering the he shalling your offering of the CLE and of the of the he be offering a sacrifice of the let him offer a without he shall offer of his own voluntary will at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation of the Lord and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him amen and we'll go to Genesis chapter 27 and this is a we're going to read verses 1 to 1 to 24 I know this is um this is quite a familiar scripture to us it's the story of uh Jacob stealing Esau's blessing but this is very important in this day now that we're alive in because uh everyone every believer feels they're unworthy and every believer feels in their own selves they don't deserve the blessings of God yeah I'll say amen for myself or maybe and yeah amen so you know but notice here okay just going to read from verse one and it came to pass that when Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called Esau his eldest son and said unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am I and he said behold now I am old I know not the day of my death now therefore take I pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison and make me Savory meat such as I love and bring it to me that I may eat and that my soul may bless thee before I die and Rebecca heard when Isaac sped Esau a son and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it and Rebecca spake unto Jacob her son saying behold I uh heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother saying bring me Venison and make me Savory meat that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord uh before my death now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which I command thee go now to the flock and fetch me from the two good of the goats and I will make them Savory meat for thy father such as he loveth and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death and Jacob said to Rebecca his mother behold Esau my brother is a hay man and I'm a smooth man my father pray Adventure will F me and I shall seem to him as a deceiver and I shall bring a curse upon me not a blessing and his mother said unto him upon Me Be Thy curse my son only obey my voice and go and fetch me them and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made Savory meat such as his father loved and Rebecca took goodly r of her Elder son Esau which was uh which were with her in the house and put them upon Jacob her younger son and he put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck and he gave the Savory meat and the bread which he had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob and he came unto her father and said my father and he said H Here Am I who art thou my son and Jacob said unto his father I am Esau thy firstborn I have done according as thou B me arise I pray thee eat sit and eat of the my venison that my soul may uh that thy soul may bless me and Isaac said unto his son how is it that thou Hast so uh how how is it that thou Hast found it so quickly my son and he said because the Lord thy God brought it to me and Isaac said unto Jacob come now I pray the that I may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son Esau or not and Jacob went near unto Isaac's father and he felt him and he said the voice is Jacob's voice but the hands are the hands of Esau and he discerned not because his hands were hay as his brother Esau's hand so he blessed him and he said who art uh art thou my very son Esau and he said I am and he said bring it near to me and I will eat of my son's venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he drank him uh and he brought him wine and he drank and his father Isaac said unto him come come now come near now and kiss me my son and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his rment uh and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is the smell of the field which the Lord has blessed therefore God give thee of the Dew of Heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine let people serve thee and Nations bow down to thee be Lord over thy Brethren and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee curs be everyone that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee and it came to pass as soon as Isaac had made to blessing Jacob that Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father when Esau his brother came in from his hunting amen may we just leave it there may the Lord bless his word you may have your seats and I want to I want to pose this question uh to you this morning what are you presenting to God that's what I want to ask but first I want to make a comment you know I think we really need to pray that we move the church halfway between here and cap I feel that I'll be honest I feel that Wednesday when we have prayer meeting God comes down like he does everyone needs to experience that amen everyone needs in that presence it's not enough just for us you just here everyone everyone needs to be in because if there's not the supernatural element of of the message of of this gospel that we have is the most important part the Supernatural part it's not just the word spoken or the doctrine or you know it's the Supernatural part of it is the most important part amen cuz what's what's good having a whole bunch of seed in the ground unless it's been watered amen amen so what's the good hearing the word unless the spirit comes and quickens it and brings it to life amen amen so we need times like that because gifts for gifts to operate in the body it takes the anointing of God to operate the gift amen so there's gifts that lay dominant people but the spirit need to come and begin to anoint that gift and to use it amen so we really need to pray seriously now we need to pray that this building is not here but it's limiting or somewhere now prices are twice as much all these things but there must be something I believe the Lord wants us all together amen amen that's just that's just how I feel because we need those because it's not just camp we had camp on Wednesday amen we had camp on Wednesday and it's not just every camp we have the we have those times all the time but we need to be in those times all the time amen amen because why do why do youth leave because they don't see God real my my my my heart's burden is that everyone who comes in these doors whatever they do with it's up to them but they all them would have a testimony God is alive in this place amen that is that is that is my burden amen is that everyone would say hey God is real here doesn't matter if they accept it or reject it that's up to them that's between them in God but I don't want to give them some excuse oh they just a different kind of people you know and they just believe something it's more than that but that God they would say hey they have God there's a presence in this place or When We Gather Wherever We Gather they can say there's a presence there it's not these four walls amen it's you that come and then he comes amen amen so wherever we gather I want that testimony and especially our children we're talking to analy and we're saying and we were talking about atmosphere and you know when he Jesus comes into the room and he does and she she knew what we were talking about amen and those things will never they I don't believe those kind of experiences they can those experiences can never leave them no matter where they go on life something in them will say you remember there you remember there when God was real there and then there and then there and then there that's what they need amen amen that's what that's what everyone needs that people more than just pray but they but something you know I think the problem with this message I'll be honest people in this message in our Humanity now this is I'm just I'm just talking to you and then we'll go to the scripture but the problem is and I found that in our Humanity if people lean one way then our Humanity will lean the other way and people have done the same thing in the message when it comes to the spiritual gifts because I see Pentecost has made what they've made of it sure they've made what they have of it but doesn't mean it's wrong in its place right amen that's right so but then so people lean people have cabbage down one side and they take the quote and they say that you know the great mystery in this end time is the is the mystery of receiving the Holy Ghost without sensation but they only take half of the statement the other half is but the person of Jesus Christ working in the person amen and you can't tell me if de comes and dwells in you you can't say that you wouldn't remember when that happened when the light went on when something happened you can't say I don't I don't know when that was you should be able to look back in your life say something happened to me there amen you saw on the day of Pentecost when when the day of Pentecost had fully come they knew something had happened amen Peter didn't stand up and say well I think this is that spoken by the prophet Joel he said this is that spoken by the prophet Joel and the people saw that their lives were different and then you see through the book of Acts when the people received the Holy Ghost their lives glorified God hallelujah amen to the life that they begin to live now glorified God yes sir amen the prophet sees after the opening of the seals the candle got to be lit and what's happened is people have gathered around Doctrine but gathering around Doctrine doesn't keep people it doesn't give it doesn't produce the character of Christ in the people it takes the life of God to come in and make that word live thank you Lord amen that's what it takes and that's why that's why we need services and we need camps and we need prayer meetings where everyone says he's real amen you know they have they have I see you know you see youth camps overseas like you know brother Tim PR they have like 500 600 youth come they have a youth camp and then one of them he said uh they had a prayer line the whole place just went all this youth went through a prayer line and then he looked up and said where's all the youth gone after this Mighty other God came down and they're all in the gym just through from where they were and they're all praying together and praising God and there's this one young guy saying it's real it's real it's real Hallelujah why cuz the anointing he knew God was real now what he did with it that's up to him but he had that testimony amen and that's my burden is that everyone would say he's real it's real it's real yes sir amen and not because they see it affecting someone because he affects them amen but we're unfortunately people have made it a scary thing oh you know if I'm accused of being too Pentecostal so be it praise amen I don't care amen if we walk with the truth I don't mean we don't make that the main thing if we have the truth and we walk in it then God will anoint it and it'll do what it wants to do amen so if we're walking with him then God will come and do what he wants to do and so we need times young and old where God comes down because it really the spirit manifests what's in the person am me it says in Hebrews 6 that the rain falls you know and it falls on the falls on the herbs it falls on the you you you the tears and all these things it's actually the the rain manifest confess what's in someone it's like you take a natural seed and you look at two seeds if you don't know what it is you say I think this is a pumpkin seed and I think this is a sunflower seed or some other seed you say well you can debate about it but then put it in the right soil and then water it give it the right food and then you'll say it's pumpkin or if it's whatever amen that's why we need those types amen amen yeah because it will manifest what's in a person and it goes beyond hey God still vindicates his word and it's not just it's not just enough for the prophet to be Vindicated what about you amen these signs shall follow them that believe now don't go seeking after signs just walk in the truth amen and then he says about and then the word says that he remains faithful he cannot deny himself so if the author if the spirit of the word is in you then you cannot deny the word amen amen so if the word says this you'll say yes and you'll do it amen but then people have mentally if you go too now that is absolutely true but then if you just gather around a Doctrine and there's no life being lived that's just another ditch amen amen you got to have hey the book of Acts church was supernaturally Vindicated that's right as a body they were Vindicated and their lives were all changed how it manifested at the Apostle Paul had far greater you know Vindication I'll say than maybe Lydia who who sold purple there in the city and used her house as a church you know all these you know or other people but how the life as long as the life was manifesting that was the main thing are you following me because it's not a list of well I've done all these Supernatural things no it's being yielded and if you can say if the word says a certain thing you give yourself because if the spirit our spirit breath Witness is his that we are the sons of God Amen but there has to be there's got to be a life it's a character that's lived every day every day CH Christian is in every day of fear where God lives every day in every situation doesn't matter if you're at home you're on the street you're in the supermarket you're at church same life is lived amen so they you know we shouldn't be afraid we should expect it you know I think you know when I come to church well before I come I say Lord I want to see you do something amen amen amen I want to see you do something not the I don't want to hear some nice words or something I've never heard before necessarily I want to see you do something AMJ I want to see the word impact me and change me amen that I'm a different I'll be molded and shaped into your image more and more Lord amen he's coming for his character in a bride amen he's not coming for anything else amen okay now with that you say well that's a big now with that we'll go to Leviticus chapter 1 we have to have God now I I don't know if I can emphasize it strongly enough the spirit of God is here in such a way that he wants to he wants to do what he wants to do and in the pre hey if you jump into a show and you turn on the water you always get wet 100% of the time you get wet amen and where the presence of God is a Supernatural is happening the prophet tells us amen so how can you not step into his presence and not be changed you can be convicted conviction is good because he's given you a way of escape to to get rid of that conviction amen however you feel it's a good thing if you're happy if you feel burdened down and and convicted just just just put it right with him amen amen amen now so we we often you know people you ask you the question what are you presenting to God because many times we we we as Believers we we see the high standard of the word and we and we hear things like she is bone of his bone and life of his life and she is him the prophet says you know that the bride of Christ becomes one with Jesus Christ and when you see her you see him because the same life that is in him comes into you we saw it on the day of Pentecost Jesus said a little while the world seeth me no more speaking of the world order but you shall see me amen and he says I'll send the comforter he also says I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you so the comforter and himself is is one and the same person he says I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world that's that's his promise and then so you see now the same life that was in him now on the day of Pentecost came into his church and so when you saw saw the apostles you saw Jesus am amen when you saw it doesn't matter if it was the oldest to the youngest man woman amen if they filled with the Holy Ghost God dwelling in them you saw Jesus you saw an expression of the word in that person's life and so and then and then you can um you know you can see that because after the Sanhedrin T to you know bolt them down and stop them preaching they took M you know they knew because he they had been with Jesus that's why they could hear you they healed the man at G beautiful but they recognized these people have been with Jesus and they see the same life so we see these things and we'd have his character as a mature individual you know a mature individual each and every one of us grow up into his character see everything he did how he responded to things we would respond the same way amen so you see these things I I you know and we can be quite daunted by these he's looking for a bride without spot or wrinkle a perfect woman that that manifests himself you know it is she is the feminine part of him we see these things it's daunting and we feel quite quite often failures now I'm not condoning if there's a part of your character that you can't overcome you need to you know you need to you need to deal with it amen but now this whole sermon is well then how do you deal with it because many times we come and we try and present ourselves before the Lord to make peace with him amen because we think many times we can bring something to the table Hello friends that's right amen you justify well I'm this good and I Know This Much scripture I've been baptized I've done this I believe the truth look I even dress right now I dress modestly you know I and then you try and bring that to the table this is not necessarily a Salvation service this an everyday Affair amen this is for everyone and so many times we think well you know we can we can bring something to bring peace with God but if you if you bring yourself if you bring yourself he doesn't accept you amen I might go deliberately slow but I trust you just don't fall asleep on me okay he doesn't he doesn't accept you if you bring the the sacrifice you bring can't have any part of you in it amen if you presenting yourself he just says I don't want your Humanity you're Fallen to begin with I don't I don't I don't want any part of you I only want one thing amen and God Abraham told Isaac when when when Isaac you know God told Isaac take your son to a place I'll show you and offer him as a burnt offering you know there came a point in the journey where Isaac and and Abraham are are going up by themselves and Isaac begins to think we have the wood we got the torch to light the sacrifice you know but where's the burnt offering where's the offering he asked his he asked his dad he didn't twig hey you know you took a while from him ask the question because normally you you know you have certain it's like you go camping and then you walk along and say Hey Dad where's the tent amen you you eventually one of your sons will look up and say to you daddy we're missing something here amen but Abraham said God himself will provide himself a sacrifice amen and so now he so God himself will provide the sacrifice and we can see we can see in in Leviticus here that the that the uh person had to give a burnt offering of his own voluntary will so no one can give you no one can offer the the the sacrifice for you you have to give it in your own voluntary will amen no one can force you no one can make you do it but they you you have to do it yourself and this and this sacrifice let's go to Leviticus 22 I'm just going to I just want to show you few things now here in Leviticus 22: 17- 24 God demands perfection amen God demands Perfection he doesn't want a half pie job he demands Perfection now I'm just trying to you think well how can I ever give Perfection you not mean to give Perfection you're not meant to give any part of yourself as a sacrifice amen what says present your body as a Living Sacrifice yeah you yield yourself but that's not the initial sacrifice amen you following me the Leviticus 22: 17- 24 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto Aaron and to his sons and unto all the children of Israel and say unto them whatsoever he be of the House of Israel or or of the strangers in Israel that will offer his oblation for all his vows and for all his Free Will offerings which he will offer unto the Lord for a burnt offering ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish of the beaves of the sheep or of the goats but whatsoever hath a blemish that you shall not offer for it shall not be acceptable for you and whosoever offereth a sacrifice of Peace offerings unto the Lord to accomplish his vow or free will offering in the beaves or sheep it shall be perfect to be it shall be perfect to be accepted there shall be no blemish therein blind or broken or maimed or having a wi or scurvy or scabbed you shall not offer these unto the Lord nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the Lord either a bulock or a lamb that hath any uh anything uh uh Superfluous or lacking in his parts that mayest thou offer for a free will offering but for a vow it shall not be accepted ye shall not offer unto the Lord that which is bruised or crushed or broken or cut neither shall you make any offering thereof in your land neither from a stranger's hand shall you offer the bread uh of your god of any of these because their corruption is in them and blemishes be in them they shall not be accepted for you see he saying he's saying that the sacrifice has to be perfect amen the sacrifice has to be perfect you say well I'm a mature Christian if you offer yourself you know we justify ourselves so much and someone who justifies himself to me is just blind amen I'll just I'll use that word if you justify yourself in any way forget it amen because if you justify yourself well I know this and I see this and I have this Revelation there therefore I can say what I want to anyone no you can't amen you got to treat everyone with the same level of respect treat and treat an elder as an elder indeed Paul tells Timothy I'm not talking about just maturity in the word as an older man amen you got to treat everyone hey people are reading you what message are you inter what what message you are you the interpretation of are the are you the interpretation of what you think are the interpretation of this amen amen are you you know we sing the song the original Life The Original Seed the original word this is what I believe the son of man is revealed the seven seal is unveiled amen he said you know we are the word made flesh today this is what the scriptures say multitudes of people can say those things but only one one group of people can actually not just say it but they their life says it amen amen amen we are the word made flesh today that's easy to say but is it a life is it a reality and it all depends what you're offering amen because if you try and bring why why is there so much why are people there's always going to be a whole bunch of make Believers unbelievers you know you see in the time of Paul people were preaching the resurrections pastor already stuff got onto the galatian church which Paul actually says that it it makes the grace of God no effect to you amen here was people that Calvary actually became no effect to them amen the power of the blood became no effect to them because they had been they had been derailed by someone who was trying to bring in something that was more than the offering that God wanted amen oh but we're Believers we have the message they had the message they had the message in their day how why would you not think those same things are try and creep in among Believers today and you look around the world and you see it has oh but we're better if you compare yourself with them if we compare ourselves as I've said in the Scripture it says if we compare ourselves with ourselves we become unwise amen what mirror are you looking in he are you just looking in a natural mirror look how look how great I am amen or you're looking in this kind of mirror now we read there that the scripture says that the that the offering has to be perfect and Jesus we understand is our is our lamb amen he is our perfect offering he went there into Pilot's judgment Hall and the scribes and Pharisees accused him of all kinds of things in the Sanhedrin then he was taken to Pilot's judgment Hall and he is examined by him and he says I find no fault in this man because there was no fault in him he was examined amen he was tried and tested in every way he was tempted on All Points yet without sin amen Paul tells us so he was by woman he was tempted by money he was tempted by popularity he is tempted by going the easy way he was tempted by conforming to the world Amen he is Tempted By by peer pressure remember all points so just whatever whatever's in there he was tempted by it yet he did not fall for the Temptation he was without sin he was examined his whole life was examined amen and then you see it's amazing when he receives the Holy Ghost there on the River Jordan where does the where does the spirit of God lead him he doesn't lead him into just having a big open campaign everything's fine he takes him into the Wilderness straight away amen and then he's tempted then then the life in him what he is is is is is tested by the devil amen now he couldn't fall because if he fell there'd be no one who who could redeem the Earth he was the only one who could do it amen but if we fall there's blood for us amen there's a sacrifice for us if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us the scripture tells us even if we fall there's blood Hallelujah but but that's where that's where God led him into the Wilderness to be tried and tested and then you see many times the light goes on on someone's life what happens things go real Ro Rocky and bumpy for a while what's happening God LED them down that way you got to understand God lead you down those ways cuz he's testing he's actually proving to the devil the life that's in you Amen to show to show him this is this is more than someone else that you've made fall and just go to the ditch of life this is one of my children Hallelujah and they might go through the ditch a while but I won't leave them in that ditch Hallelujah I'm going to bring them out again amen hallelujah so God God God is not afraid to have you tested but you see he was tested at all points he was found without sin so then now then we have to we have to really think about now what are we offering because there's a but we have a man as has and built in them self- condemnation we're not worthy we're not you know people people sometimes get an idea I just think about this uh over the last few weeks people get this idea that people have to get on some great spiritual plane and then Angels descend and visitations happen then Visions happen that they get on some some some Plateau up here and then God speaks to them I've seen it amen this is not this is yeah people get that idea they have to get on some spiritual plan and now they're walking with God Jesus came to minister he says blessed thou blessed are the poor in spirit amen blessed are the you blessed are the meek Hallelujah blessed are those ones Jesus comes to minister to those kind of people amen so Jesus gives visitations to those kind of people hallelujah poor in spirit amen those who are downtrod those who feel weak a Shepherd you know he says he says a Shepherd is like he has 100 sheep and one goes Wayward amen and then he goes and then he gets that he leaves the 99 get the one now who's been on a sheep farm before who's who's who's seen how sheep operate sometimes they're just walking along they go Wayward I mean they get stuck in bushes they get you think how did you get into that place but they in they find themselves in those kind of places and sometimes we look at each other and we think how did they get into that place amen but there's still a sheep Hallelujah if someone's a Sheep amen the shepherd will come and grab grab them and that should be that should be that to me I'm just echoing the words of John Andes you should go listen to it but he says that is the bride's Ministry amen where where our heart should be there's a sheep in a Thicket we must go get that one amen because we go Wayward it says in the scripture they've all gone astray but I don't believe right never go astray are you sure look at me I can do it look daddy I can run now you know kids kids they start crawling they hurt themselves they start to pull themselves up walk along furniture they hurt themselves even more they begin to walk they hurt themselves even more they run oh man they hurt themselves even more than that am but they think they can do it amen but they they end up with bruises and all kinds of pains and all these things because they think now I can do it amen if you think you can do it enjoy a lot of unpleasant times amen I can do it we're to be our perfect strength is in perfect what weakness but I'm a mature son or daughter of God I seen The Prophet's life the more he walked with God the more he depended upon God am amen so the more mature he became came the more dependent he became on the Lord himself and we think we're a walking quotebook and We Know It All amen but as long as you're a Sheep amen hey I've gone waywood you can get all grumpy and fussy and all these you know then amen amen oh is that waywood yeah it can be absolutely where does that take you where's that path going to take take you is it walking with the shepherd are you going off this way it'll take you that way that's right amen but I have rights you don't have rights I have an opinion no you don't I don't have an opinion I do not care I think I said it last time I was here I don't care about my opinion my opinion means nothing amen who cares about what I think what god what have you said what have you declared in your word yes sir you know brother brah he says he says it's like he says like the pool of Bethesda it was just water nothing special but when the angel of the Lord stepped down into it that's when healing could come that's when things could come and he says I'm just like you know you know we're just like that I'm your brother but then when he comes down he says when he comes down I become the voice of God to you he says now I think I felt a bit of resentment about I felt a bit bad saying that I'm going to say it again when he comes down I become the voice of God to he says the second time I say it un inspiration so one time he said it but then God said say it again amen because that's true amen amen now there's a there's a scripture we see in Luke and in Matthew Jesus speaks of the of the call to the feast to the wedding Feast for his for a son now in these in these two scriptures the most the most uh the most likely guest never come amen they they turn it down flat the the people you would think would be there they reject it like the scribes and Pharisees you think they would have just broken down their denominational ideas they would have walked they would have just walked with the Messiah and they would have had a glorious time the most likely one said crucify him amen the most likely rejected and then now it just comes down and then the and then the king says to the servants go get the lame get the halt get the blind get the good it says it says in Matthew 22:10 call the good and the bad amen just just just call whosoever Will so it doesn't matter your previous condition he just covers all the you know he doesn't say call the rich says Jesus says to the poor the gospel is preached Amen to the poor in spirit the gospel is preached amen not to the rich who think they have everything there's a condition we get in this world I have need of nothing I have riched in with Goods everything's going fine if you think you have need of nothing you're in a you're naked blind and miserable and don't even know it I have it all sorted no you got to depend upon Him amen you got to depend upon Him amen and then so so the king just says call the good and the bad it doesn't matter what condition they're in it doesn't matter if they're crippled or good you know or evil or whatever they are just call them and then when they all come you know how the feast were done in those days the people came to the door there's one door they came in the door amen their feet were washed they were given a robe and they are anointed and they bid welcome and they came into the feast and everyone after they come in the door they all look the same you couldn't tell if it was a rich man you're talking to or a poor man or a good man or you know whatever man amen they all look the same it's the same with the cripples you know have you have you read the story of uh was it uh Mish here you know that story he is the son of Jonathan amen David becomes king and and then he remembers his great love for Jonathan so he asked his servants are there any are there any of Jonathan's family still alive because remember Jonathan died in battle with Saul and they say yes there one mbth now mbth was crippled amen because uh because what happened is as soon as his family found out that Jonathan and Saul were dead the the nurse or whoever it was picked him up when he was young and ran for their lives basically and and he was dropped and his legs became crippled because he he was dropped said to walk he was crippled amen but he was B to come to the king's tableall amen and then when he sat down at the king's table his feet were under the table you didn't see his broken crippled anymore he looked like everyone else at that table amen hallelujah and it's a same with us it doesn't matter what state you come in or what state you may find yourself in now amen he's he's calling you to come to the table amen sit under that table and your Brokenness you're crippled your mess it's not seen hallelujah hallelujah amen that's the same with the wedding Feast just come as long as you receive the invitation just come amen but if you think you know some and then you know some people just say well you know everyone made excuse the first group I I got land I got to go see the land I bought some cows yeah I've done this and I cannot go they made excuses amen and the excuse and another excuse is I'm not worthy it doesn't matter what condition you're in amen I trust this is sinking in a little bit it doesn't matter what condition you think Ur in that's irrelevant have you received the invitation why did why did it says behold I send you Elijah the prophet why did he come here's a wedding invitation amen here's a wedding invitation here here come the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him become one with him amen that's the invitation that's been sent in this day he says the bridegroom call will come right through this amen what is that bridegroom call go out to meet him Unite with him amen become one with your bridegroom that your old identity is washed away in his blood and you become Mrs Jesus Christ hallelujah oh I'm not worthy it doesn't matter the the when the when the when the priest when the man brought the offering to the priest who was examined who was examined it wasn't him amen I know I've probably said these things before but I just trust it sinks in amen he didn't the priest as soon as he saw the offering he didn't look at the guy anymore he he totally forget him and he just looked at the lamb says now I've got to inspect this thing am mean you just go to one side this has got to be perfect he's a sincere priest he's going to examine it pretty good you know they're looking for a red heer sacrifice I'm sure you've heard about it they need there's a there's a purification for the priest they need a red heer without blemish then they kill it they burn it they mix the ashes with water and they sprinkle it on the priesthood it's a purification for sin the scripture says now that that in reality that in reality is Christ the word the people need the word to be washed we're Washed by the Water of the word you can't be washed by denominational word it's got to be a pure word and we've received a pure word in this day to wash the people hallelujah amen but that but that red hi has got to be perfect and they examine them and they think I think this is one then then there's a little white hair and they can't pluck out the white hair and say oh it's fine anden they actually say no this one one cannot be accepted amen they they go over a fine tooth comb now just because they do that in this day they would have done that in that day as well amen because the priest you know it wasn't games it wasn't games to be a priest they would remember when when Eli and his sons polluted the priesthood and what happened to them amen and they would think well oh well this is a modern age we've moved on no God is still the same am so they would have thought I do not want that to fall upon me amen so they would have examined the animal and when the animal was examined and was found to be perfect then the worshipper could come back now Put Your Head Upon the Put Your Head Upon the put your hand upon the head of the animal Hallelujah then I'm going to kill the animal amen that that you're going to be associated with the with the death of this animal Hallelujah and so he was he was you know it was the animal that was examined and then the animal was given on behalf of the worshipper amen and so if the worshipper knew this lamb is perfect or whatever it was if they if they knew that that lamb was perfect they could have confidence they could just come and offer it Hallelujah they didn't have to worry about themselves amen they just they just looked at the lamb they had confidence in their lamb Hallelujah they weren't worried about what they did they knew the priest has to accept this offering Hallelujah and it's the same thing friends you times that by a billion TR Infinities when when when our lamb stood upon the Earth he says for this cause I've come into the world he knew he was the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he's a perfect man he lived in a realm to himself I mean not a man spake like that or acted like that or did those kind of things he is a perfect man amen hallelujah and it's amazing because pilate brings him out he says behold the man and if only if only his eyes are open he'd say Behold the Lamb that must be offered for you amen and then so he was accepted and the reason he was accepted is because when he ascended the Holy Ghost came back down amen because it was just man's blood the spirit of God would never come and dwelt in the people because by one offering he has forever San he has perfected them forever which are Sanctified by one offering amen so now he has he has done that that God can come and dwell in you because we all have a Fallen sin nature whether we like it or not that we're born with and that sin n nature must die amen this is not a this is not a rehab house not a halfway house this is not a Reformation that's right oh I'm just doing a little bit better this week praise the Lord but don't depend upon that it's got a life has got to come in and then then the victories will come amen let's go to Ezekiel 36 amen I can even find it oh yeah Ezekiel Lamentations Ezekiel Daniel wait yes so we're reading from verse 25 he says then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh and I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and to keep my judgments and do them so it's only when it's only when the spirit of God comes in then you can keep his word he says I will CA you I'm going to read that again and I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them how do they keep them because the spirit of God is in the person amen that's how you keep the word none of us can keep the word in our own strength amen but if you if you say well I've been a good Christian all my life and I can do all these things God doesn't accept you you have to offer a lamb amen you've got to be identified with the lamb amen you have to you have to offer what are you offering to God I trust by now you say not me I'm not giving anything I could do you have to you have to depend upon what he has done for you and then now you say well I've accepted him it's one thing for him to you to accept him he's got to accept you amen you go back to Cain and Abel Abel was his sacrifice was accepted so therefore Abel was accepted amen any people they give offerings in this day but they never look to think have I been accepted has my offering been accepted amen this is not a play on words he has to accept you touch you not the unclean thing and I will receive you sayith the Lord amen you know true sanctification is not just dressing right it's got to be sanctification in here amen and then it's lived out if it's in here that's true sanctification changing how you dress because it's what you hear is just a Reformation which is good obedience is better than sacrifice but you got to be Sanctified out of here your Nature's got to change amen and the reason I can say that is because God has provided a lamb that the nature of the sacrifice can come into you amen the nature you see a lamb innocent you know gentle loving animal but because it was animal life it wasn't it didn't you know animals don't have a soul then the nature of the Lamb could never come back upon the worshipper and change that worshipper that they would stop doing what caused them to bring the offering in the first place place you following me if someone came they did something whatever it was and they brought the lamb they they left with those same desires but they were justified by giving the offering amen but they left the very same person that's not what Christianity is about that was under the blood of bulls and goats under the blood of Jesus Christ the very life that was in our Lamb of God comes into you amen how do you know I'm accepted because his life remember they put their hands upon the head of the sacrifice to to connect themselves with their sacrifice how we connected because the life that was released on Calvary comes into you amen and that's how you know you're accepted amen are you got to believe by faith absolutely but we can read in the book of Acts let's go to Acts chapter 8 you say I believed it by faith you have to believe it by faith but there has to come a time where God recognizes your faith amen amen Acts chapter 8 we'll go to we'll go to verse let's start from verse n we'll go to verse 16 but there was a certain man called Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one to to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the uh is the great power of God and to him they had regard because that of a long time he had Bewitched them with sorceries but when they believ Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they are baptized both men and women then Simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Philip and wondered beholding the Miracles and signs which were done now when the apostles which were Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they would come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so they received the word of God Amen but the very nature of the Lamb hadn't come into them yet amen and then Paul asked Apollos into acts 18 have you receed and and start of Acts 19 have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed that word in the Greek doesn't mean when since you have believed has he come and recognized your faith by giving you the Holy Ghost amen has he changed your nature hey some place in the book of Acts they spoke with tongues others they didn't it doesn't matter what happens to you it's the life that is afterwards that matters but something's got to happen you've got to have an experience but your life afterwards has to reflect a new life has come into me amen and that's how you know you've been identified with the sacrifice you say well how do well you say and then also will you say well Jesus died 2000 years ago I can't go back to G you know you know Golgotha and lay my hands upon his head that's true you got to receive it by faith amen amen and when you receive the word if you receive the truth of the word that links you back into what he did amen you say well how do you know this message is true this is how I know it's true Jesus is the high priest of our profession many and you hear in a multitude of sermons brother Braham standing there at the pulpit calls out someone in the audience this is your name this is where you're from this is this is you know what you've come to be prayer for you know and then has a question who did he touch who did she touch they're 30 ft from me that you they didn't touch me he says they touched the high priest amen now why is that significant because if he's the high priest that can be touched and that happened he's saying what brother Braham saying is the high priest was there in the room amen that's why he could take a human vessel and reveal what's going on in someone's life he he's actually saying the high priest Jesus himself is in the room you touch the high priest Hallelujah and it's the high priest that went into the holy of holies once a year with the blood and if the high priest if that sacrifice was accepted and the high priest came out alive the people could Rejoice knowing that their sins are forgiven and then Jesus when he came out of the Tomb Tri you know triumphantly he arose up into heaven because he says remember he sister to was it Mary and Martha don't touch me yet I haven't ascended to my father so he had had to ascend and then offer the sacrifice here it is here it is Father I'll just dramatize a little bit I mean here's the blood he goes into the very presence of God it says in Hebrews by a New and Living Way amen through the veil saying his flesh Peter speaks so so he rent The Veil he stepped in the very presence of God and then he came back down and he says now touch me handle me feel me so so the high priest went up the offering was accepted he came back down he says now touch me amen and so that same that same high priest is present in this day and that's why brother R said who did he touch who did she touch she touched the high priest amen and if so if you have the high priest you have the blood amen if you don't have the high priest there's no way the blood can go onto the mercy said you be forgiven going in the Old Testament type so multitudes have what they claim to be the blood amen multitudes claim they have the high priest but who has the high priest and the high priest has declared himself saying this is me this is me here I am amen I've come to reveal myself in this end time that you may know your sins have been forgiven hallelujah amen well what does that got to do with me if you believe the words that that man spoke amen that was the high priest speaking he says now whatever he said you just go do amen that is not pie in the sky I have to say it amen so if you believe what he said oh that's that's a Kian opinion from the 1960s no it's not that's Elijah and Elijah came to turn our hearts back to the original Faith so whatever he said you know the truth as I've said the truth is not a bunch of ideas that changes by culture or we're in 2016 things have changed things have changed but God is still the same amen the world is just run that way as fast as it can but the truth is right here amen well this is you say well I can't identify myself with such thinking that's why you got to cast down your thinking because whether we like it or not wherever we're born affects the way we think and our family makeup and our you know our schooling the you the whole idea of how we think is actually been constructed by the society oh no there you know you I'm a free thinker are you whether you like it or not if you were born here just have you're an identical twist and one of you was raised here the other one was raised in the back of India someplace how they think over there they're both going to think differently yes amen because the society they're in is changing how they think amen God has to undo a whole bunch of that stuff that's right I mean God has to well I've been raised this way in a church you know I was thinking I know this is on the internet you know I'd love it if we had our own church building if some church just gave us a building and that be oh or if we could even rent some church halfway for a midweek meeting now this is I might be totally this is just me and fellowship but I was thinking but then I saw imagine if we were in the first church age uh you know in the book of Acts and they went to the Temple of Diana and said can we use your temple to have a meeting in do you think they would do that can we go into the temp temple of mars or Jupiter or some Heathen place can we have church in here amen they would never even think we're going to have church in that kind of place now you may think that's too far out there but what are they worshiping in ignorance sincere I'm not taking that from but what are they worshiping amen just I just thought about it amen but you know I'm not sure where I'm going with that but you know sometimes we have to oh no I was thinking oh but I was raised in church amen who says what is taught to you in church raising up was right amen because of it was right why would you need something more amen if it gave you overcoming power there then you don't need the why would God send a message why would God say in this end time come out of her my people as it said in Revelations 18 where that word was made flesh in this end time when there's a voice came amen an angel came down from heaven and the whole world was lighten with his glory and voice said come out of her my people yes amen if you you could get that there you following me so you say well but this is how we did it there does that mean it's right here amen that's why with wisdom we got to take it back to the word and say well is this how things should be done amen and then we should also look and say well why you know if things work in other places in other message places then we should say why is that working and then if other things are not working we should think why is that not working amen we should patent ourselves to a degree not to be a copy but you know what I mean for example if a church is just full of old people but they're married they got kids but it's just all old people you'll think what happened there why has it become like that doesn't mean they're they're they're they're not real Believers but but what happened there do we want that amen we don't want that so whatever theyve been doing we we shouldn't follow that amen but if there's a church where there's old to Young and and it's actually the youth that are that are pushing the service forward right amen that are really pulling on the word and that really want to enter in we say what do they have right amen we want to do what they do that's right amen that's right now I'm just basically I'm just sharing my heart today amen but you got to think what do they do because we don't want to make the same mistakes that other Generations have made sure they had it sure they had it harder and some respects than what we have something and if we think we're better than anyone else we're going to fall but we have something that's very pure amen that's right but then I said you know you know I said to them up there you step into the Pres of God Amen there were people and I was using some of you I didn't call you by name but I was using some examples some people had this problem they don't have that problem no more amen the people were bound with this they're not bound no more people were discouraged they're not discouraged no more amen amen because they stepped they made contact with the supernatural God they made in contact with the land amen amen hallelujah and that is such an important thing where when what are you offering you got to offer the lamb whatever you do don't bring yourself into it say you know say Lord here's and that's why I said the high priest you say well we have the high priest now why why's that so important because we have the blood amen and so so here is the very high priest with the blood stepping forth saying here I am you want forgiveness of sins I have the blood and he was speaking through that man so if you believe what he said you get tied into the high priest so you say now now now you can actually offer something to the Lord amen now we because because we have that we have a pure word of God by teaching the Commandments and doctrines of men you make the word of God no effect to the people amen so if you just believe if you believe the Commandments and doctrines of men you make the lamb you can't become with the lamb Amen in its fullness why does a foolish virgin have to go into the tribulation because they reject the full atonement amen they you say they're partially you say they're forgiven because they were they were clean living to the to the Lord but they didn't have the full effect of the atonement in their lives amen amen what's that they didn't have the life of the lamb in them because they had no oil oh that's you know that's that's some other group hold on I'm going to say this there's scripture there's scripture in the Bible where it says that everyone is going to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ now I know I'm going all over the place but I just want to I'm just going to share what's on my heart today there's a scripture where we all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and some will be given great rewards amen some you know and all of our works will be made manifest so if you build hey wood and stubble it'll be burned it'll be tried in the fire and burned but if you build gold and precious ston all these things that will stand so what that is that's not the great white throwing in judgment that is actually a judgment for rewards you say will God do that yeah doesn't mean you become unb don't get me wrong but people get different rewards for what they've done in this flesh amen because that's how God works God is like a you know you know he's the best boss there is and he and and he gives benefits he pays everyone the same wage eternal life but then he gives you know certain things you say at the end of the year you did this you deserve this you did this you deserve this amen so our our lives are going to actually be put on a screen and God is actually saying now what did you build what did you build in this life did you build hay wood and stubble and it says that they'll be ashamed on on that day amen did you build Haywood and stubble or did you build things that can be tried in the fire and will stand so what did you do oh but I'm saved I have the Holy Ghost I'm you can't just sit back and say everything's easy and good amen I'm not now I'm not talking about earning your way into heaven this is not what I'm talking about talking about rewards on the other side amen well I'm going to be there everything's fine and dandy if I'm going to be there I'm going to be there there's still going to be a judgment what did you do what did you choose to do in this life amen did you give your all for me or did you just put your feet up in a in a armchair and just watch the world go by amen what are you going to do if you have the nature of the Lamb amen that's why it's such a fine line if you have but then brother BR brought it so well the fine line is well there's works and there's there's predestin there The Armenian ISM and the Calvinism but so one side says I'm going to be there I'm going to be there watch the world go by God will do it he's Sovereign the other group says I've really got to work out your salvation with fear and trembling amen and then basically you know work your way into the kingdom you know the Kingdom's you know the violent take it by force and that's true the kingdom is taken the violent take it by force what is that knock Lord I need this amen give it unto me he says knock and you shall find seek ye first the kingdom of God the song We sung knock and you shall find seek and you you know knock and it shall be open to you seek and you shall find amen so there's that too now but brother brah brings it such a nice middle he says but if you love him if you love him amen and he uses the you know illustration with him and his wife he says now one side says this just before he goes on a on a campaign or goes overseas one side says now Mrs brandom I'll tell you thou shall not you know go out with any other husbands you shall not have any other husbands when I'm away you shall not do this and she grabs him by the TI and says now Mr brandom let me tell you you shall not have any wives other wives will I'm away soon as I find out if you've had one you divorced as soon as you at home then the other side says well doesn't really matter amen but he says but if there's love there if there's genuine love he says because I love my wife and she loves me we wouldn't want to do those things but if I did what if I did that I believe she would forgive me because we love each other so our great our great motivation should be love amen amen are you following me why so it's not works to to to gain something but it's out of love so what do you want to build because there's going to be a day and there's going to be Believers that it's going to be hay wooden stubble and they're going to be ashamed amen there are people are going to FF that scripture amen but others are going to have go gold tried in the fire and their Works going to stand what do you want it to be amen what do you want it to be so you know but if it's out of love love should be the motivator amen I read in Galatians and I probably can't find it says that faith faith uh love worketh Faith or something no I won't even try and find it go read the book of Galatians amen but what do you you know what are you offering I may you know maybe I should just wind this up but but what are you offering you say well I have I have this problem I have this problem what are you offering amen I have this need what are you offering because if we try and offer ourselves and try and work out our own selves you'll never get what you need amen I believe you know you know you know I told them there at Camp I said I said a guy you an atheist guy you know at our camp you he tried to tell me God's not real I said it's too late you can't tell me he's not real I've met him then other people say well there's no no such thing as just instant Deliverance I'm sorry but I've been delivered that way I me there's no such thing as just being healed I'm sorry but I've had that happen to me amen amen there's no such thing as a transforming power of God I'm sorry but it's happened to me and I said about some of you things that you guys have gone through I said you can't tell those people God's not real amen it's because they came in contact with the lambah Hallelujah it doesn't matter if you've got bitterness or sadness or whatever you're carrying amen you have an offering say Lord I Want to Be Free of this thing am Hallelujah you have what you need you just got to give the lamb well I need to work everything out just give the lamb I've got lots of pains from my childhood just give the lamb Hallelujah if you want to be forgiven you have to forgive you actually have to let it go am mean you actually have to unforgiveness binds people go please everyone listen to that sermon John Andy preached the last one he preached you listen to it about forgiveness go listen to it whatever you do he talks about it very well he's saying he's saying if if you don't forgive someone they're still Bound by your unforgiveness amen and you're bound too Jesus says if you don't forgive neither will I forgive you oh but I'm the bride Lord if you don't forgive he won't forgive you amen how does a root of business coming into someone they don't forgive oh but but but they treated me terribly probably they did I wasn't looking for it this just happened yeah but if you don't just give it up that's right amen the world is a terrible place and we're not immune from it amen hey Jesus Jesus could have been a bitter man there he is he came to his own his own received him not that's the saddest to me that is the saddest scripture I think brother B actually said the second most saddest one is the I stand the door and knock the most pathetic picture amen he came to his own his own received him not how ridiculous it's such a sad picture amen and the blood and water separated you you when the solders pierced his side with the spear blood and water came out CH he died of a broken heart he didn't die from all the wounds he died of a broken heart because har he was rejected but what did he say father forgive them they don't know what they do he actually released them of what he of what they did to him amen oh I can't do that but you have a lamb I can't do it on my own strength you have a lamb that that with through that lamb you can you can do it amen you can actually do it don't hold on to anything well they haven't ask forgiveness it doesn't matter right it doesn't matter they may never admit they did something wrong to you it doesn't matter that's between them and God but if you can just forgive and release it amen you can walk on amen that's right but mommy and daddy did this to me you got to forgive them amen you think about you know there's so many cases in the scripture you take for example who is it Jacob it's one of the Jacob I think it's Jacob when he's younger one of his daughters 14 years old that's what the Jewish tradition say she went out to see the daughters of the land and one of the guys actually I use the word raped her and then wanted to marry her it's in the book of Genesis the and and and and the history just says they say she was only 14 she wasn't looking for that amen people don't go looking for things they may be Wayward but we don't go looking for things to destroy us break you w looking for it oh I want to be hurt and M and and wounded and all these things you weren't looking for it you amen now what are you going to do with it but God has provided a lamb Hallelujah I mean God has provided a way that you can not only forgive that person you can be free of that hallelujah amen God heals uh emotional wounding spiritual wounds God heals those kind of wounds it's not just physical wounds God can take reach into your spirit like only he can do it and he can heal things and he can make things right amen if you let him do it now sure it takes some things take a long time to heal sometimes instantly sometimes it takes a while but God can do it amen a lot of medicine you don't just take one pill and you're done some things it is one hit wonder amen but you got to take the dose amen and sometimes God heals like this sometimes it takes a while while but you say but then like like antibiotics it may wreck you like it has a me a couple of times just taking it but you know that it's going to make you better after you finished it amen and you just you just keep taking the pill thank you Lord amen hey God uses medicine I don't know if youve discovered that God uses medicine sometimes like this sometimes just with medicine so but you have confidence what you're taking is going to make you better amen and it's the same thing with the lamb amen I trust you have faith that what you have is healing you but you have to give it over to him amen you have to be willing if you got just let things go as I've said before a sheep is not a beast of burden now this is this is totally not what I said at Youth Camp but we've just gone this direction I think it's fine but a sheep is not a beast of burden that's right amen they are not you do not see packs on a Sheep amen and we are sheep but if you thing is if you don't if you don't actually forgive and give it over then your whole life actually becomes dictated to by that thing hey if you cut off my leg my leg would be totally my life would be different and my my leg would limitate what I could do can you know can and cannot do amen you take that into a spiritual thing people people live their life through a hurt you don't have to live a life through a hurt amen we have a lamb we have a lamb that can heal that amen you don't have to you know you see you see people you see message people you know just because we are in the truth it doesn't mean we're exempt from these things but people's whole life can be governed because of a pain or a complex from the past amen and you can actually see it amen but we have a lamb hallelujah amen we have we actually have we have him we have the sacrifice we have the lamb we have God's provided way he is the Lord God that heals all of our diseases I is that just natural to me that's not just natural amen we have the lamb but you have to be willing perfect Faith now this is in Mark I think it was the Sunday School thing I'm not sure perfect faith is based on forgiveness you go you go listen to this sermon perfect faith and he reads a scripture from Mark 11 you know if you say to this mountain be thou removed it be cast into the sea you know if you say and then he said and then in that scripture it says straight off that it says about forgiving oh I want perfect Faith you have to forgive you can't have perfect Faith unless you forgive amen amen and in that in that sermon he talks about Peter walking on the water he says his faith he had the faith to do it but then when he begin to see the sea amen and the storm that's when he begin to sink and we have to come to a place where the storms of life don't affect our faith amen because that is perfect Faith where your faith it doesn't matter what comes you can just walk with God but the good thing is Peter he was the only one who got out out of the boat amen it doesn't matter if you sink a few times just get out of the boat hey hey the other disciples had no Bragging Rights and then and then when Jesus he said he said you know he cries out Lord I'm I'm going to drown whatever he says and then Jesus straight over picks them up and they both walk back to the boat together amen I tell you after that Peter would never have said oh I nearly drun he said I walked on water Hallelujah you you amen that's true hey think you know you can be in something that nearly goes terribly bad but you just look at the bad hey I did this it was awesome Amen cuz he walked with the lamb he walked with the lamb am now what about you amen we have to have perfect Faith he wants perfect faith in this hour from his bride amen that we can go above things of good things of Life affect our faith you know he makes a statement and and and and with this I'm going to close he says lot he said the little faith lot has was paralyzed by the glamour that was in Sodom amen so either your faith either the world will paralyze your faith or your faith will paralyze the world in your life which way do you want it to be do you want the devil to be paralyzed by your faith amen or do you want your faith to be paralyzed by the devil amen choose you this day which way do you want it to be well I want to to paralyze the devil forgive amen just let it go let's bow our heads in a word of prayer and if anyone would like prayer you're more than welcome to come gracious father Lord this this turned out very different to what happened on Saturday night Lord we thank you for your guiding and leading in in your word father I just pray
