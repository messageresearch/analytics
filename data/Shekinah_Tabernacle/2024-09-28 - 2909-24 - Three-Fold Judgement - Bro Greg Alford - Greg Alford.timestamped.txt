[0:02] good
[0:03] morning I give you a warm welcome this
[0:07] morning in the name of Jesus
[0:08] Christ it's good to uh see you all
[0:12] here and I welcome all the visitors
[0:16] too and I commend
[0:24] you some of you live
[0:26] maybe are we talking 2 hours with
[0:29] brother Moses
[0:31] about 2 hours man that's 3 hours this
[0:33] morning a cuz the clock's
[0:35] got messed around
[0:37] so that's a good
[0:40] effort but hey you know let's not pet
[0:42] ourselves on the back too much we would
[0:45] wake up at 3:00 to catch an
[0:47] airplane get to the airport you
[0:50] know so you know we I think the Lord is
[0:54] worth the
[0:55] effort but but I know he does appreciate
[0:57] effort too
[1:00] he was a way bit disappointed at the
[1:02] apostles the disciples when he went to
[1:04] the garden and they were asleep he said
[1:05] you know couldn't you wait for an hour
[1:07] you know and they're all
[1:10] asleep you know I know he understands
[1:12] we're human but then we don't want to
[1:15] take that excuse on too much and think
[1:17] well I'm just human because you know
[1:19] humans can do amazing things if they put
[1:20] their mind to it athletes and people
[1:23] that that really want to achieve
[1:25] something can can they give it their all
[1:27] they can achieve they can push the body
[1:29] and things to amazing places and you
[1:32] know I think for the Lord It's Worth
[1:33] pushing for him you know there's a lot
[1:36] of time to rest on the other side so
[1:38] I've always
[1:41] envisaged I always thought I'm I want to
[1:43] end up on the other side
[1:45] exhausted I don't want to end up there
[1:47] refreshed you know like oh this is I
[1:49] want to end up there exhausted because
[1:50] then I'm going to enjoy the rest you
[1:52] know so so I think for the kingdom of
[1:53] God and I believe I'm I'm amongst people
[1:55] this morning that are willing to give
[1:56] their all for the kingdom of God because
[1:58] he's he's worthy this morning let's um

[34:13] about myself so we're glad to be here
[34:16] with you today you may be seated for
[34:17] just a few minutes I I kind of want to
[34:19] get the butterflies all flying in the
[34:21] right
[34:23] direction um like you said we moved to
[34:27] New Zealand in
[34:28] 1972 I see a few people that might be in
[34:30] my age bracket and uh you remember Norm
[34:34] Kirk was the prime minister of New
[34:36] Zealand when we arrived and uh so a lot
[34:40] of years ago and I came across this
[34:42] message within within a year of coming
[34:44] here and yet there was a message church
[34:46] just 30 miles south of where we lived in
[34:51] Oregon and uh I remember coming into the
[34:55] things of the message and I hearing
[34:56] brother brandom say it'll be these young
[34:58] men that'll take the message into the
[34:59] Rapture and I was it that's right I was
[35:03] 25 years of age and uh so yeah we sort
[35:07] of felt this is it yeah we're going
[35:09] we're going in the Rapture you know and
[35:10] then 1977 came around and because we
[35:13] read the church age book and we got kind
[35:15] of confused at that
[35:17] and we wondered well okay let's go to
[35:20] the South Island so we went to the South
[35:22] Island and we we've been on the mainland
[35:25] ever since
[35:30] you know what I'm talking about these
[35:31] young ones don't what I'm talking about
[35:32] do
[35:32] [Laughter]
[35:34] they when we had our first convention
[35:36] down there in
[35:38] 1978
[35:40] 77 uh we had North Islanders come down
[35:43] and you know there was this big debate
[35:44] on who is the mainland and uh so that's
[35:48] kind of drifted away over the years but
[35:49] we're glad to be in service with you
[35:51] here today we trust that we can say
[35:53] something that would help you along the
[35:54] way um we bring you greetings from our
[35:57] sh assembly there in Kaio and we've got
[36:01] uh some men that are going to be going
[36:03] into the prison this afternoon to
[36:05] minister in the prison as well so God's
[36:07] opened the door there for us and and uh
[36:10] yeah we're just glad to be able to be
[36:12] share the word of God with you today
[36:15] trusting somehow that it will might well
[36:17] what I'm going to do today is I trust
[36:20] that it will you'll be able to identify
[36:23] yourself you know because so often when
[36:25] the preacher preaches he he says things
[36:27] and it goes right over the top and and I
[36:31] want to be able to say something here
[36:32] today that would say you know okay I
[36:34] know where I'm at I know exactly what
[36:37] God's dealing with me I know exactly why
[36:40] I'm in the position because I've been
[36:43] uh back in the prisons again ministering
[36:46] not back in there and staying but back
[36:48] in the prisons ministering for the last
[36:49] four years again 20 years ago I got
[36:52] kicked out of the prisons because of the
[36:53] message and then all of a sudden
[36:55] supernaturally God led us back into the
[36:57] prison and gave us an audience there and
[37:02] if is there any of you have ever dealt
[37:03] with the prison system here in New
[37:05] Zealand no okay so what's happening is
[37:07] they don't want you to talk about hell
[37:09] they don't want you to talk about uh
[37:11] Salvation they they just want you to
[37:13] talk about feel-good things and so what
[37:15] has happened then is that uh I if if I
[37:19] was underneath the chaplain see I
[37:22] couldn't do
[37:23] that but I'm under a
[37:25] volunteer so I go win as a volunteer
[37:28] rather than than as a as a minister for
[37:31] the chaplaincy and so they don't care
[37:33] what I
[37:35] say so we we've just really enjoyed some
[37:37] good times and uh we have a lot of young
[37:40] men in New Zealand 60% of the men who
[37:43] are in prison end up
[37:45] reoffending so the first thing I asked
[37:47] them is uh so how do you learn cuz we
[37:51] had two sons and the oldest boy was a
[37:54] real go-getter and the young one kind of
[37:56] tailed in behind him maybe you have
[37:58] children like that as well and so if
[38:01] they got in trouble the youngest boy
[38:04] would say he did it Dad it was him not
[38:07] me and so I said you know some people
[38:10] learn by their own
[38:11] mistakes right and some people learn by
[38:14] watching other people do things and then
[38:16] saying no that doesn't work I'm not
[38:17] going to do that and then other people
[38:20] just don't learn at all so I say to the
[38:23] prisoners what are you where are you
[38:27] because you know I'm going to teach you
[38:29] because I deal with a thing called anger
[38:31] resolution not anger management anger
[38:34] resolution because you can all have
[38:36] anger that's a natural phenomena within
[38:38] the human race but what do I do to
[38:41] resolve the problems that anger has
[38:44] created not manage them resolve the
[38:48] issues and I said I'm going to give you
[38:50] the tools to resolve them but you have
[38:53] got to have Christ in your life or you
[38:55] will never totally conquer that anger
[38:58] problem it will always be there and
[39:00] you'll always be in trouble
[39:03] so I'm not going to deal with that
[39:06] today so let's stand as we get go to
[39:09] God's word and I'm going to take a
[39:11] little thing then and you can plug me in
[39:12] now uh to for my slideshow because I
[39:16] started doing op so I had the privilege
[39:19] and some of you may have uh watched his
[39:22] ministry um Jimmy amigo
[39:28] uh some of you may have watched brother
[39:30] Lonnie Jenkins Ministry and I had the
[39:33] privilege of
[39:34] uh of sitting under Lonnie's ministry as
[39:37] far as having him come to my church at
[39:39] times and then I went and stayed with
[39:41] him at his house and and had fellowship
[39:43] with him and and I kind of caught on to
[39:45] some of the things that he he does as
[39:47] far as
[39:48] delivery and I found that when you have
[39:51] a picture a picture says a thousand
[39:53] words right and so what we're looking at
[39:56] today is I'm going to give you
[39:58] illustrations to be able to identify
[40:00] where you're at you'll be able to
[40:01] pinpoint exactly what where God is
[40:04] dealing with
[40:05] you so let's go to the Book of Psalms
[40:08] first and we're going to deal with the
[40:10] three-fold Judgment of God now there's
[40:13] more than that and I'm going to explain
[40:14] that to begin with but I want to first
[40:16] of all just start with with a three-fold
[40:19] judgment of God in Psalms
[40:21] 1 on 119 verse
[40:25] 30 so often other Christian talk about
[40:30] the love of God and the grace of God and
[40:32] all that's true but we forget that there
[40:34] is a judgment of God as well if you're
[40:36] not careful and we don't want to we
[40:38] don't want to be there at that Judgment
[40:39] Day and not have it said in the right
[40:42] way that you know depart from me you
[40:45] workers of iniquity we want well done th
[40:47] good and faithful servant we don't want
[40:49] to we don't want the other way around so
[40:52] Psalm
[40:53] 119:30 says I have chosen the way of
[40:56] Truth truth thy judgments have I laid
[41:00] before me so let's pray together
[41:04] heavenly father as we look into this
[41:05] thought we pray that your Holy Spirit
[41:08] would keep me focused amen Lord don't
[41:10] let me go up any rabbit burls and and
[41:13] just let me stay focused on what you
[41:14] want me to say so that you could be
[41:16] glorified within our midst today
[41:19] vindicate your word in our hearts and
[41:20] our lives we ask in Jesus name amen God
[41:24] bless you may be
[41:25] seated stay with him and 190 and 119
[41:29] because we're just going to go right
[41:30] through the whole the whole Psalm let's
[41:33] jump over to one uh verse
[41:37] 52 remember thy judgment oh l oh of old
[41:41] oh Lord and have comforted me myself
[41:45] then go over to
[41:47] 62 at midnight I will rise and give
[41:49] thanks unto thee because of thy
[41:52] righteous judgment so David's he's going
[41:55] this whole Psalm is dedicated virtually
[41:56] for his for judgment go to 75 verse
[42:01] 75 I know oh Lord that thy judgments are
[42:05] right and thou art faithful and has
[42:08] Afflicted me
[42:11] 102 I have not departed from thy
[42:14] judgments for thou Hast taught
[42:17] me
[42:19] 156 great are thy Tender Mercies oh Lord
[42:22] Quicken me according to thy
[42:24] judgment and then the final one
[42:27] 160 Thy word is true from the beginning
[42:31] every one of thy righteous judgments
[42:34] endureth forever yeah so God's we can
[42:38] say here God is a god of judgment right
[42:41] and yet he's still a god of Grace but
[42:43] let me just give you some statistics
[42:46] here so over 200 times salvation is
[42:51] spoken of in the Bible but judgment is
[42:54] spoken of over 400 times so you know we
[42:58] we know that God's got Grace we know
[42:59] that he's got Mercy but he also has got
[43:01] a judgment because you've got to have a
[43:03] contrast right that's right you cannot
[43:06] you cannot have a heaven without a hell
[43:09] because there would be no reason for you
[43:12] to want to be in heaven if it just all
[43:14] happened without some other form of bad
[43:19] that could happen to
[43:20] you and so as we as we look through this
[43:23] thought I thought that I would uh sort
[43:26] of go from from the judgments of God and
[43:28] it looks like my mouth is working so uh
[43:33] this is an interesting
[43:35] one so here in Acts
[43:38] 24:24 uh Paul is with
[43:41] Felix and he's been asked to
[43:45] explain the
[43:47] gospel and so he goes through and he
[43:50] says and after certain days when Felix
[43:52] came with his wife drilia which was a
[43:55] Jewish he sent for Paul and heard him
[43:58] concerning the faith in Christ so what a
[44:01] good thing you know he actually wanted
[44:03] to know what what is Christ all about
[44:05] what are you what are you what are you
[44:07] trying to tell
[44:08] us and so and as he reasoned of
[44:12] righteousness and Temperance and
[44:13] judgment Felix
[44:16] trembled so you know he got
[44:19] through you know it was registering yeah
[44:22] you know a lot of times when you talk to
[44:24] people they don't
[44:25] register right or else they're looking
[44:28] to counterd do what you're saying you
[44:31] know they're looking for the argument
[44:33] rather than for listening to what you're
[44:34] saying and so here Paul as he was
[44:37] preaching was such he was the Lord was
[44:39] there and magnifying his word so much
[44:41] that he trembled at the
[44:44] word he realized this is true yeah I
[44:47] need to do
[44:48] something and and
[44:51] yet the old man kicked in right the his
[44:54] he trembled at the he trembled and
[44:56] answered go thy way for this time when I
[44:59] have a convenient season I will call for
[45:02] thee isn't that
[45:05] interesting that that somebody could be
[45:07] so affected by the word of God that they
[45:10] trembled at at hearing it knowing what
[45:12] was going to happen to them and then say
[45:16] Oh come back another
[45:18] day but you know if you follow the
[45:20] scriptures through he never asked him to
[45:22] come
[45:23] back so where does Felix stand today
[45:26] then
[45:27] now I'm not his judge but you know after
[45:31] death comes
[45:32] judgment so there is a there is a
[45:34] judgment time and and when you know the
[45:37] word then you're responsible for what
[45:40] the word says to
[45:42] you let me give you an example
[45:47] just we have this woman who lives next
[45:49] door to our church she's a Pentecostal
[45:51] person and she's been involved in uh
[45:54] Pentecost AOG and and uh
[45:57] I think the other one was New Life
[45:58] Center down in the Christ Church area
[46:00] and she uh she's moved in next we have a
[46:03] block of flats longside our church and
[46:06] so she comes along to a Sunday night
[46:08] service that we have where we just hang
[46:10] sing hymns and and choruses and things
[46:12] like that and have testimony time and
[46:14] and just it's I tried to get the people
[46:17] to invite somebody you know uh because
[46:19] you know if you don't start doing that
[46:21] you become the chosen
[46:24] Frozen right because you you know you're
[46:27] just kind of locked into your little
[46:28] groupy and bless God it's us four and no
[46:31] more and I I'm not too sure about you
[46:34] either but so you know we we we're not
[46:37] careful we do those sorts of things and
[46:39] so she she came she comes along and at
[46:42] first for a long time she was wearing a
[46:44] trousers when she came which is a normal
[46:46] dress for a woman nowadays not when Norm
[46:48] Kirk's day was around right the Kiwi
[46:51] women dressed in dresses in those days
[46:53] but not no anyway she sitting there and
[46:57] as we're leading song and Caleb's
[46:59] leading song I guess and and uh God
[47:03] speaks to her heart and he said would it
[47:06] be all right for Caleb to wear a
[47:09] dress nobody's talking to her she's
[47:11] God's speaking to her heart she says no
[47:15] it wouldn't
[47:16] be and then the voice came back then why
[47:19] are you wearing
[47:21] trousers wow nobody nobody said anything
[47:24] we just all we were doing was singing
[47:26] choruses there was no preaching there
[47:28] was you know just singing A Chorus
[47:29] giving testimony to the Lord and she
[47:31] felt
[47:33] convicted so she
[47:35] changed so last month we just you know
[47:38] three it's the third Sunday of every
[47:39] month last month she come along and she
[47:43] I said you're were late she said I had
[47:45] to get my skirt
[47:46] [Laughter]
[47:49] on so she'll no other time but if you're
[47:53] going to come to church here we're going
[47:54] to put a skirt on we're going to put a
[47:56] dress on
[47:58] but you know the word had
[48:00] penetrated right and so that's what we
[48:04] want is the word to penetrate in our
[48:05] lives correct so let's let's just go
[48:08] through some of the judgments of God to
[48:10] begin with and just give you an overview
[48:13] so we have the guy here and we realize
[48:14] that uh if he accepts Christ then Christ
[48:17] becomes his judgment and that's a
[48:19] judgment for the past right because once
[48:22] you give your life to Christ that's it
[48:25] your sin has been dealt with
[48:27] right you don't pay for that sin again
[48:29] oh my Lord he he he he paid for it right
[48:32] he paid for it all but we'll we'll I
[48:34] don't want to carry there because we're
[48:35] going to I'm going to tell you what I'm
[48:37] going to do and then I'm going to tell
[48:38] you how I do it and then I'm going to
[48:40] give you an example of of where you're
[48:43] at okay so then we have next one the
[48:46] judgment is is for present as a son
[48:49] because now you're a son and daughter of
[48:51] God
[48:51] correct right you receive Christ as your
[48:54] savior you're a son and daughter of God
[48:55] you're not dealing with your sin now
[48:58] although you do make
[49:00] mistakes so he's not dealing he's not
[49:02] dealing with your sin though because
[49:03] your sin question was dealt with at
[49:04] Calvary thank
[49:06] you and then the future one is as a
[49:10] servant so what did you do for the Lord
[49:13] now that you became a Christian what did
[49:15] you do for the Lord and and so we want
[49:18] to be able to know what that is and then
[49:20] of course the last judgment is the great
[49:22] white Throne
[49:23] judgment and then we realize if we go a
[49:25] little bit further with that we as we
[49:27] look into it we realize that that
[49:29] there's there's more to that when we
[49:31] when we take the next step so let's
[49:34] let's just expand it out a little bit
[49:36] here and we see that uh if we don't
[49:39] receive Christ then there's a hell that
[49:41] aways right after death comes judgment
[49:44] and that becomes at the white Throne
[49:46] judgment when everybody will be brought
[49:48] up and there'll be a judgment given and
[49:50] the bride will sit there with Christ to
[49:52] judge the world right and so now anybody
[49:55] who's not found written in the Lamb's
[49:57] Book of Life or in the book of life will
[49:59] be judged and be put into the Lake of
[50:02] Fire correct so if we follow a little
[50:04] bit further we realize that there's a
[50:07] tribulation period we realize there's a
[50:09] millennium and then after the thousand
[50:11] years we realize then the Judgment
[50:14] comes but we have also the Judgment of
[50:16] the Nations at that time when we come to
[50:19] the seventh judgment we have the
[50:21] Judgment of Israel and we have the
[50:23] Judgment of the Angels who fell let me
[50:26] give you some script here so we
[50:27] understand where we're coming from so in
[50:30] 2 Peter 2:4 it says for for if God
[50:33] spared not the angels that sin but cast
[50:36] them down to Hell and delivered them
[50:38] into chains of Darkness to be reserved
[50:41] unto
[50:42] judgment right so those ones that were
[50:44] in the days of Noah they will be judged
[50:47] eventually because they didn't receive
[50:50] the word of God and they'll be judged
[50:52] for what they knew so the Judgment of
[50:54] the Nations is there the Judgment of the
[50:57] Gentiles the Judgment of the Jew the
[51:00] Judgment of the Angels it's all comes at
[51:02] the end time
[51:05] now as we take this a little bit step
[51:08] further look at what brother Bram says
[51:10] here he says and if you've been accepted
[51:12] in Christ and Christ took my judgment
[51:15] and I accepted his propitiation for my
[51:18] sin how can God judge me yeah how can he
[51:24] he took my sin right so he's done judge
[51:28] me when he judged Christ then I'm free
[51:31] from judgment when I see the blood I'll
[51:34] pass over
[51:38] you now that don't mean I don't make
[51:41] mistakes right my old Nature has to
[51:44] die but as far as the sin question is
[51:47] concerned because you know it wasn't me
[51:50] that put my name on The Book of
[51:52] Life my name was put there before the
[51:55] foundation of the world
[51:57] right and all of a sudden I recognized
[51:59] it amen and when I saw it I go whoa
[52:02] really
[52:04] me so we we see that happen now let's
[52:08] let's take this and and start to break
[52:11] it down so basically as a as a human
[52:13] being and and in my case I was 25 years
[52:16] of age when I came to this
[52:18] country and I knew I was a sinner but I
[52:22] wasn't
[52:25] bad you know I was wasn't that bad you
[52:27] know I paid my taxes and you know I I
[52:31] was good to my wife that's my first wife
[52:34] and
[52:35] uh and so I I wasn't bad person but then
[52:40] I we ended up in a little bible study
[52:41] out in the place called a mockery in out
[52:44] near blackhead Beach uh here in the
[52:45] north island and um and I learned that I
[52:49] was
[52:51] lost I'd grown up in a church I played
[52:54] Church basketball for our church team we
[52:57] were we were we were state champs for
[52:59] five years in a row man when I was back
[53:02] in the 60s so yeah know we were we were
[53:04] good
[53:05] guys even got up in front of the whole
[53:07] church and the church applauded us for
[53:09] playing winning the championship for the
[53:11] church basketball team
[53:16] Whoopi but I didn't know Christ right
[53:21] and so I I as I began to read the Bible
[53:23] I I realized I was lost I realized I
[53:26] needed
[53:27] Christ so I can take you to the house I
[53:31] can take you to the spot where I knelt
[53:34] down and I gave my life to Christ I can
[53:36] take you it's here in New Zealand I can
[53:38] take you to that
[53:41] place cuz something happened that day
[53:44] now that didn't finish it and there's a
[53:46] lot needed to go on after that but that
[53:49] day I gave my life to Christ and my
[53:52] burden rolled off my sin burden was
[53:55] rolled off oh my
[53:58] so we realize that also that God loves
[54:01] me and he paid a price for me now let me
[54:04] back some of these things up with
[54:05] scripture so we get get an understanding
[54:07] of where we're coming from so the Bible
[54:10] tells us in Romans
[54:13] 3:23 for all have sinned and come short
[54:15] of the glory of
[54:17] God and in fact Paul picked that up from
[54:20] Psalms 14 where it says for all they
[54:23] have gone astray all together become
[54:25] filthy there is none know that doeth
[54:28] good know not one so you know Paul
[54:31] grabbed the stuff from the Old Testament
[54:32] brought it into the New Testament and
[54:34] showed that it was absolutely
[54:36] true so as we go a little bit further
[54:40] the Bible also shows us that uh
[54:43] wherefore by one man's sin sin sin
[54:46] entered into the world and death by sin
[54:48] so death passed upon all men for all
[54:51] have sinned so the Bible clearly shows
[54:53] us that all have sinned there's none
[54:55] righteous
[54:57] and I'm sure you've probably been to
[54:59] funerals where they say well he's
[55:01] looking down upon us now and you know
[55:03] and and these sorts of things I went to
[55:06] a Catholic funeral once uh one of our
[55:09] older sisters at the time which probably
[55:11] none of you would remember uh anyway her
[55:15] grandson had passed away as a young age
[55:17] and it was they were catholic and so
[55:19] they took the smoke and they put the
[55:22] smoke around there around the coffin and
[55:24] and and and the priest was very good
[55:26] good he told me exactly what he was
[55:28] doing and why he was doing it so as you
[55:30] know these things so why they put the
[55:32] smoke around there is they released the
[55:34] spirit so the spirit can't release until
[55:37] they put the smoke around
[55:38] there it has nothing to do with the
[55:41] Bible right it's all dogma of what they
[55:45] feel is
[55:46] right and and so yeah it it was kind of
[55:49] interesting but got Bible tells us here
[55:51] that God loves us so if God loves us and
[55:53] Christ died for me then he took my Place
[55:57] yeah amen wow he took my place amen and
[56:00] because he took my place
[56:02] then then I I can come to this place
[56:05] where the Bible tells
[56:08] us Romans 5:8 for God commanded his love
[56:11] toward us and while we were yet sinners
[56:13] Christ died for us Ephesians 4 or
[56:18] Ephesians 2 ver4 but God who is rich in
[56:20] Mercy with his great love wherein he
[56:23] loved us even when we were dead in sin
[56:25] Quicken together in Christ by grace are
[56:28] you saved so we see that there's plenty
[56:31] of scripture and we realize that Christ
[56:34] then took my place for my sin and when
[56:37] he took my place for my sin the Bible
[56:39] says Isaiah 53 all we like sheep are
[56:43] gone astray we have turned everyone to
[56:46] his own way and the lord has laid upon
[56:48] him the iniquity of us all so Christ
[56:51] took my place
[56:53] amen and the Bible tells us in many the
[56:56] other
[56:57] places so the Bible tells us in 1 Peter
[57:00] 3:13 Christ also has suffered once for
[57:04] sin the just for the unjust that he
[57:06] might bring us to God being put to Death
[57:09] In the Flesh and quickened by the spirit
[57:12] so the Bible then tells us he says to us
[57:15] he says now uh in Isaiah
[57:19] 53 uh sorry in Isaiah 1:18 come let us
[57:23] reason together sayeth the Lord though
[57:25] your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as
[57:28] white as wool and though they be red
[57:30] like Crimson they will be as they shall
[57:33] be as wool so we see here God has made a
[57:36] way for you and I to come but I have to
[57:40] accept that you know and even I you know
[57:43] going to Sunday school as a kid and
[57:46] drawing the pictures and coloring in and
[57:49] all the things that kids do at Sunday
[57:51] school I never realized what Christ had
[57:53] to
[57:54] come I you know I I believed in a God
[57:58] but I never realized why Christ had to
[58:01] come so when we were young and if you
[58:03] can go back in your life maybe like this
[58:05] too when we were young I was married I
[58:09] married my first wife when she was uh 18
[58:11] and I was
[58:12] 19 I don't recommend that right we were
[58:16] just kids but you know thank God he came
[58:19] into our lives and changed our lives
[58:21] right so uh you know we were at had a
[58:25] young couples around us at that time and
[58:27] I remember one night we were sitting
[58:29] around the house and and
[58:32] um talking and
[58:35] uh yeah well maybe I should yeah we
[58:37] drank a little beer and
[58:39] had you know and I mean we were we were
[58:42] Sinners man and and we got to talking
[58:45] now Vietnam War was on at that time and
[58:48] uh they were taking young men at 18
[58:51] years of age I was 19 but then they came
[58:55] to a place to where uh Johnson had said
[58:57] well as long as the young man is married
[58:59] he don't have to go to war so I got
[59:03] married and then then we go a little bit
[59:06] further on a few years go a bit farther
[59:08] along and then they they say we're
[59:09] taking young men that are married I had
[59:11] a child we had a child and then went a
[59:14] little bit further on and they said
[59:16] we're taking young
[59:18] men with two children but no the war
[59:21] stopped then so you know I I just kept
[59:24] One Jump Ahead all the time right I
[59:26] didn't have to go to war but you know we
[59:28] were sitting there this guy and he he
[59:30] was the same position I was in and we
[59:32] were talking about God and we were and
[59:34] and I said to him so you're in a trench
[59:37] over in Vietnam and the Viet Kong are
[59:40] spraying the thing with
[59:41] bullets you're not going to ask God to
[59:44] help
[59:45] you he said
[59:47] no I said I
[59:49] would see and and I think God takes
[59:53] those confessions when you really don't
[59:55] even know anything about about it right
[59:57] he takes that confession and he made a
[1:00:00] way for me then to learn later
[1:00:02] on and so that was years later you know
[1:00:05] may I was maybe 21 22 years old I was 25
[1:00:08] before he he actually came into my life
[1:00:11] but God kept putting people in my life
[1:00:13] that would begin to tell us about the
[1:00:16] Lord and before I left to go to New
[1:00:19] Zealand I had an old hunting partner
[1:00:21] that I used to go deer hunting with and
[1:00:24] um he came came to me and he'd been a
[1:00:28] Pentecostal boy he belonged to the
[1:00:32] uh Amy simple mcferson group and uh
[1:00:37] anyway
[1:00:38] he he was a rat
[1:00:41] bag yeah he was a Pentecostal boy but he
[1:00:43] was a rat bag you know he he was into
[1:00:45] drinking he was into everything but then
[1:00:48] he got saved and I watched the
[1:00:53] change we used to take alcohol to where
[1:00:56] we go deer hunting cuz we went by
[1:00:57] horseback up into the Wilderness Area of
[1:00:59] Oregon and uh then we got to a place to
[1:01:02] where we didn't take alcohol he took a
[1:01:04] Bible and he's laying on his bed reading
[1:01:07] his Bible and we're sitting around the
[1:01:08] campfire
[1:01:09] drinking so there was a change
[1:01:12] yeah and so when I was ready to come he
[1:01:14] came to me he says I want you to know
[1:01:16] one thing you need Christ in your life I
[1:01:19] said I believe in God but I don't know
[1:01:20] who this Jesus Christ is yeah because
[1:01:23] you know in Sunday school we did they
[1:01:24] never put it together
[1:01:26] Jesus was just a good man did wonderful
[1:01:29] things and
[1:01:31] so when he said that to me I go oh okay
[1:01:35] you know see you
[1:01:37] later then when I started the church I
[1:01:41] gone back in
[1:01:42] 1983 just before I started the church
[1:01:44] and I told him I felt that God was
[1:01:46] calling me into the
[1:01:47] ministry and I'd sent him a letter when
[1:01:49] I got
[1:01:50] saved and he had moved addresses but the
[1:01:53] letter arrived at his address and so he
[1:01:56] opened the letter and as he's driving he
[1:01:58] had to stop to read the letter because
[1:02:00] he was crying so hard because I had
[1:02:03] gotten
[1:02:04] saved
[1:02:06] wow now God puts people in your lives
[1:02:10] and they just kind of drop a little
[1:02:12] something in there that you you know
[1:02:13] you're not even aware of to begin with
[1:02:16] and then it just dribbles on down until
[1:02:18] it finally hits the rock bottom and then
[1:02:21] you get locked into it and
[1:02:23] so I told him I got saved so I went home
[1:02:27] and he gave me 500 us
[1:02:30] smackers so in those days it was double
[1:02:32] so I was a th000 bucks I started the
[1:02:34] church on $1,000 and I said Lord when it
[1:02:36] runs out I
[1:02:40] quit you know that was Faith yeah right
[1:02:44] and so uh because I sort of felt well
[1:02:47] because you you know as a young man you
[1:02:48] know you uh listen to the message doing
[1:02:51] God a service without his will and I
[1:02:54] don't want to be doing that I want to do
[1:02:56] God's service in his will not out of his
[1:02:58] will I want to be in his will and so you
[1:03:01] know if Lord if it's your will you'll
[1:03:03] make this thing profit if it's not your
[1:03:04] will you let it die okay so anyway we we
[1:03:09] started off with that and you know I was
[1:03:11] able to share with him later on that by
[1:03:13] your money this place is still going wow
[1:03:16] wow 40 years now 40 years we've been
[1:03:20] going some of you kids weren't even
[1:03:22] thought
[1:03:23] of so what we're dealing with here now
[1:03:26] is we're dealing with the Judgment of
[1:03:28] sin and really what we're talking about
[1:03:31] then it's
[1:03:32] past it's dealt with I don't go back and
[1:03:36] confess all the old sins that I did I I
[1:03:39] did that at Calvary and and you know I
[1:03:41] made that that
[1:03:43] confession and you know I'm one of those
[1:03:46] guys that kind of likes the individual
[1:03:48] to to make a
[1:03:51] confession of their own
[1:03:53] words because you know you can lead them
[1:03:56] in a sinner's prayer but the
[1:03:59] relationship is between you and God not
[1:04:01] me you and
[1:04:03] God and I can maybe Kickstart you to
[1:04:06] give you a a little bit of a start but
[1:04:08] you you need to do that that's right and
[1:04:11] I had a woman in my church for five
[1:04:13] years that was unsaved and she was the
[1:04:18] boy and the girl were kind of friendly
[1:04:20] together and but he wasn't going to
[1:04:21] marry her until she'd given her life to
[1:04:23] Christ and you know many of you know
[1:04:26] that we lost our oldest boy at 30 at 21
[1:04:29] years of age 35 years ago and uh on the
[1:04:33] fifth anniversary of his death I was
[1:04:36] kind of down I said God can you do
[1:04:39] something for
[1:04:41] us do something for a special today it
[1:04:44] was the anniversary of his death and I
[1:04:47] said would you do something special and
[1:04:49] he told me I'm going to do something
[1:04:51] special
[1:04:53] so we had full church at that time only
[1:04:58] seated 70 but it was pretty well full
[1:05:00] and and uh I preached the
[1:05:04] message all of a sudden this this sister
[1:05:08] well she's a sister now but she she come
[1:05:10] forward and she's one of those private
[1:05:13] people you know don't like
[1:05:16] to you know be out there too much and
[1:05:19] very private and so she come up and she
[1:05:22] stood there and I knew it I said that's
[1:05:26] it Lord thank you thank you Lord so I I
[1:05:29] said whatat are you here for and she had
[1:05:31] her head down she says you
[1:05:35] know I said no I
[1:05:37] don't she said you know I said no I
[1:05:40] don't tell me what do you hear
[1:05:43] for because I wanted her to say I want
[1:05:46] to receive Christ as my savior right
[1:05:49] because it's out of the confession of
[1:05:50] your mouth that you're saved not not
[1:05:53] because you felt some pull by the holy
[1:05:55] Spirit you know I've talked to some of
[1:05:57] the older ones when God was really
[1:05:59] moving by his spirit in the the 50s and
[1:06:01] 60s I don't know if you guys ever
[1:06:03] remembered a guy named Harold
[1:06:04] hilderbrandt but he was he was a
[1:06:06] minister in the message but he was
[1:06:08] raised in in Pentecost and he say when
[1:06:11] he backslid he had to hang on to the
[1:06:13] seat so he wouldn't go forward the pull
[1:06:16] was so strong for him to come you don't
[1:06:18] have that today if there's a little
[1:06:20] inkling in your heart you need to go you
[1:06:22] need to make it right with God right cuz
[1:06:24] God's not pulling like that anymore you
[1:06:26] know and so you know I waited for her
[1:06:29] and she wouldn't say anything I said
[1:06:31] would you like me to help you yes she
[1:06:34] would she wouldn't even speak she was
[1:06:37] tears running down her face and
[1:06:38] everything I thought well that's a good
[1:06:39] sign and so we we let her started it off
[1:06:43] and then got her to Kickstart it and got
[1:06:45] her going and Margie you know her Karen
[1:06:49] Tolson so yeah it's it's one of those
[1:06:52] things that God does right and that's
[1:06:54] what we want to is to where they make
[1:06:56] that confession because now the sin has
[1:06:59] been judged it's passed right the Bible
[1:07:02] says if we confess with our mouth the
[1:07:04] Lord Jesus believe in thy heart God has
[1:07:06] raised him from the dead Thou shalt be
[1:07:11] saved finished amen it's not even
[1:07:14] dealing with
[1:07:16] feelings it's confession with the mouth
[1:07:18] Thou shalt be saved it's not dealing
[1:07:21] with feelings all feelings will be a
[1:07:22] part of it but it it's not really
[1:07:24] dealing with feelings it's dealing with
[1:07:26] just
[1:07:27] that so let me give you a little
[1:07:29] illustration that that would kind of
[1:07:30] maybe help
[1:07:33] you so in the wild west days they would
[1:07:36] have prairie fires and the fires would
[1:07:39] burn through the Prairie and if a cowboy
[1:07:41] was out on the open and range and he
[1:07:43] seen the fire coming there was no way he
[1:07:45] could outrun the fire so what he would
[1:07:47] do is start a
[1:07:49] backfire where he's at at the present
[1:07:51] moment and he would let that fire run
[1:07:54] ahead of him then because it's blown
[1:07:55] behind him and he's going to let that
[1:07:56] fire run ahead of him so when that fire
[1:07:59] run far enough ahead of him he'd step
[1:08:01] out into that burnt
[1:08:02] ground now as the fire is coming in from
[1:08:05] behind him it's not going to touch him
[1:08:07] because it's already been
[1:08:09] burnt and he's safe and he can carry on
[1:08:12] going right the way the fire is going
[1:08:14] because he's behind the fire now he's
[1:08:16] not in front of the
[1:08:17] fire so that's what he is with Christ in
[1:08:20] you yeah you confess he's faithful and
[1:08:23] just to forgive you
[1:08:26] wow man I got up out of that time when I
[1:08:29] gave my life to the Christ and I was by
[1:08:31] Tears were pouring down my face but
[1:08:33] praise God I was free right I i'
[1:08:36] received something
[1:08:40] right so as we as we look at it the
[1:08:42] Bible tells us then and maybe you want
[1:08:45] to turn to this one let's go to 2
[1:08:47] Thessalonians 1 because we realize now
[1:08:50] that the judgment is on Christ not on us
[1:08:55] and so when when we look at this thing
[1:08:56] we see it as a past
[1:09:03] now 2 Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 8 it
[1:09:07] says INF flaming fire taking Vengeance
[1:09:10] on them that know not
[1:09:13] God and Obey not the gospel of our Lord
[1:09:16] Jesus Christ so when the Judgment comes
[1:09:19] it's going to be upon those who have not
[1:09:22] received Christ as their savior that's
[1:09:24] right
[1:09:27] so we see that happening and we realize
[1:09:29] it's a past judgment now so there can't
[1:09:31] be a double jeopardy because it's
[1:09:34] already been judged yeah we're finished
[1:09:36] with that the Bible tells us for he was
[1:09:40] made sin who knew no sin that I might
[1:09:43] become the righteousness of
[1:09:46] God now I know I don't look
[1:09:49] righteous but it's not what I look like
[1:09:52] it's what he said amen cuz I know I've
[1:09:55] got faults and I'm sure if if I hang
[1:09:58] around you I'm going to find some faults
[1:10:01] right we're very good at
[1:10:02] that we'll find your we'll find your
[1:10:04] faults I guarantee you I will find your
[1:10:07] fault and you'll guarantee me that
[1:10:10] you'll find my fault right because
[1:10:12] that's that's the way we
[1:10:15] are okay so now we're in this position
[1:10:18] now where we've given our life to Christ
[1:10:20] so what where are we at then okay so
[1:10:23] from now on now we are a son of God and
[1:10:25] because we are a son of God we don't
[1:10:27] have judgment as far as Sin is concerned
[1:10:29] any longer because God loved us so now I
[1:10:31] move to the to the next step which is
[1:10:33] I'm under a judgment as a servant or as
[1:10:36] a son
[1:10:37] sorry and so as a judgment as a son now
[1:10:41] we see that the Bible tells us in First
[1:10:44] Peter 4:1 17 for the time is come that
[1:10:48] judgment must begin at the house of God
[1:10:51] and if it first begin at us what shall
[1:10:54] the end be to them that obey not the
[1:10:58] gospel so that's happening right
[1:11:02] now that's what you come to church for
[1:11:05] it's not to be happy Clapper we enjoy
[1:11:07] that too but there is something that we
[1:11:09] want to be judged by and so we want to
[1:11:12] get the Judgment as a son so we become
[1:11:14] so the the name on the check is is
[1:11:18] good
[1:11:21] righten
[1:11:23] now I try not to go over any rabbit Bros
[1:11:25] you got to let me go this
[1:11:28] one just recently how how many of you
[1:11:31] know Ron Peterson minister in Arizona
[1:11:34] friend okay so he's I've I've known Ron
[1:11:36] for probably 20 years and and had him
[1:11:38] preach a couple of times at the church
[1:11:40] who had done missionary work with him
[1:11:42] and anyway his wife ended up with breast
[1:11:45] cancer and so she had a lump
[1:11:48] epom and she prayed in the name of Sandy
[1:11:53] Peterson I claim my he
[1:11:58] and when I first heard that I thought
[1:12:00] what are you doing didn't brother
[1:12:02] Brandon tell you the your name on the
[1:12:04] check is as good as
[1:12:07] his and she was
[1:12:10] healed now I wouldn't have done it that
[1:12:12] way would you I would have claimed the
[1:12:14] name of Jesus but you know if you're in
[1:12:17] a right relationship with the Lord he
[1:12:19] brother brand said the your name on the
[1:12:21] check is as good as the father's right
[1:12:26] I don't NE please understand I don't
[1:12:28] necessarily agree with this this isn't
[1:12:29] Alfred's Doctrine one and
[1:12:31] one right it's it's just that you know
[1:12:34] she did it and it happened and she got
[1:12:37] up before the church and she testified
[1:12:39] that God had healed her and she's come
[1:12:41] back
[1:12:42] clean what can I do right because your
[1:12:46] testimony is what God did for you am
[1:12:50] right and I may not like your
[1:12:52] Doctrine I may disagree with your
[1:12:54] Doctrine but your testimony I cannot
[1:12:57] deny if God did it for
[1:12:59] you how can I do that that's that's
[1:13:01] between you and the
[1:13:08] Lord so as we get judged as a as a son
[1:13:11] now let's see what brother brand says
[1:13:13] about it and when you come to a place
[1:13:16] called Kadesh barer at one of the time
[1:13:18] the I'm told was a great judgment seat I
[1:13:21] say a great spring of well there many
[1:13:25] little Wells a perfect type of the
[1:13:28] church the church is the Judgment seat
[1:13:31] where Heaven is the Judgment seat of God
[1:13:36] and the little Wells represent little
[1:13:39] churches all out and judgment begins at
[1:13:42] the house of God see here's where the
[1:13:45] judgment
[1:13:47] begins so you know there's the quote
[1:13:51] that brother brandom used we call it the
[1:13:53] word to the church you're all big one
[1:13:55] happy family now but Satan won't leave
[1:13:58] you like that he will send somebody in
[1:14:02] and he says don't you take sides with it
[1:14:05] because it's the devil and then you pray
[1:14:07] for that brother you pray for that
[1:14:09] sister whoever it might be that God will
[1:14:11] change them or move them
[1:14:13] out right now I've been around long
[1:14:17] enough but I've had I've seen that
[1:14:20] happen very vividly very vividly and you
[1:14:24] know you you you put time into people
[1:14:27] you put time into the situations you you
[1:14:29] go out of your way and they turn around
[1:14:32] and go right against the word of
[1:14:34] God some of them have I had to put out
[1:14:36] from underneath the blood some of them
[1:14:39] I've just said I think it's better you
[1:14:41] go somewhere
[1:14:42] else but it happens right and who am I
[1:14:46] who am I to do that right because I've
[1:14:49] got problems but we also have to keep
[1:14:52] the church clean that's right you can't
[1:14:54] have blatant sin in the church right so
[1:14:58] you've got to there's there's things
[1:14:59] there's in the scripture first 1
[1:15:01] Corinthians 5 gives you the list tells
[1:15:03] you exactly what to do and one
[1:15:06] individual that I put out over 25 years
[1:15:10] ago she she thank God she well thank God
[1:15:14] that's not the right word to use um well
[1:15:16] thank God she's not in my church I can
[1:15:17] say that
[1:15:18] yeah when I when I took her out from
[1:15:21] underneath the
[1:15:22] blood she knew the word of good enough
[1:15:24] she he says I
[1:15:26] Repent you've got to take me back I said
[1:15:30] I ain't taking you back till you become
[1:15:31] born
[1:15:33] again because there was no birth in her
[1:15:35] she used the church to manipulate to
[1:15:38] whatever she
[1:15:40] needed and then would just come in on
[1:15:43] people
[1:15:45] hard and
[1:15:47] so I had to deal with it and it's not an
[1:15:51] easy thing to do I mean I don't want to
[1:15:53] it's it's just like
[1:15:55] okay it's just like marriage and
[1:15:58] divorce and I don't want to put any step
[1:16:00] on anybody's toes here but you know I
[1:16:04] some things seem very
[1:16:06] unfair right because we've watched over
[1:16:10] the years women young girls get married
[1:16:13] to guys and they're they look like
[1:16:15] they're solid but they turn out to be a
[1:16:16] dead
[1:16:17] loss and then they can't marry
[1:16:20] again hope this is okay Ben you might
[1:16:22] have to fix it up later
[1:16:26] but you know and and so the pastor has
[1:16:29] to take a stand on you
[1:16:31] cannot and when it's for the third
[1:16:35] time this what happened down
[1:16:37] home she had already had two living
[1:16:40] husbands and came the
[1:16:42] third what do you to do the Bible said
[1:16:45] till death do you part that's why I said
[1:16:48] that's my first wife my only
[1:16:53] wife right cuz you know what do you to
[1:16:56] do and and and you understand you know I
[1:16:59] mean because a woman's nature is to to
[1:17:01] nurture and to care and to to have a
[1:17:03] home and everything and and I feel for
[1:17:05] them because you know without that and
[1:17:07] their kids are raised in their
[1:17:09] mid-40s you feel for
[1:17:13] him but hey I have to stay with what the
[1:17:16] word says because judgment begins at the
[1:17:19] house of God that's amen it's not a
[1:17:23] condemnation but it's judging it's a
[1:17:27] Discerning
[1:17:30] wow we'll never going to get through
[1:17:32] this we don't carry on so let's look at
[1:17:35] this as the sun how God's going to judge
[1:17:38] you so first thing we realize it's a
[1:17:40] present day thing am this is
[1:17:44] happening on a regular basis we'll put
[1:17:47] it that
[1:17:49] way and so as we look at it happening on
[1:17:51] a regular
[1:17:53] basis we accept that Christ paid the
[1:17:55] penalty for sin and I've been born again
[1:17:58] into the family because the Bible says
[1:17:59] for as many as received him to them gave
[1:18:02] you power to become the Son of God but
[1:18:05] after that the Bible also says that we
[1:18:08] are to realize that there is a present
[1:18:12] day judgment go with me to Romans
[1:18:15] 8 verse4 and let's just go down through
[1:18:18] Romans 8 and see how Paul put this out
[1:18:21] here for us hallelujah in Romans 8:14 he
[1:18:25] begins to tell the church here he says
[1:18:27] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:18:30] God they are the sons of God for ye have
[1:18:33] not received the spirit of
[1:18:35] bondage again to fear but ye have
[1:18:39] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:18:41] you cry Abba
[1:18:43] Father amen that happens right he's your
[1:18:46] father now okay then he goes on he says
[1:18:50] it's the spirit that bears witness with
[1:18:53] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:18:55] God and if children then Hees and HS of
[1:18:59] God and Joint HS with Christ so now I I
[1:19:02] because I'm a son I'm an heir of God I'm
[1:19:05] a joint Heir I've got an
[1:19:08] inheritance with God because of what I
[1:19:12] did at Cal what he did at Calvary and I
[1:19:14] accepted it nobody can take that away
[1:19:17] from me that's right nobody can take
[1:19:19] that away from
[1:19:21] you okay so as a son we should live then
[1:19:24] to please the
[1:19:26] father right and you know when your kids
[1:19:29] are
[1:19:31] small they want to please
[1:19:33] you you know and and you know you say
[1:19:37] good boy good girl you made your bed you
[1:19:40] threw your dirty clothes down you did
[1:19:44] that good good girl so you know the and
[1:19:48] and you know the encouragement then
[1:19:50] makes the kid want to do it even
[1:19:53] more right
[1:19:55] should right and so we we see then that
[1:19:59] God wants us to feel encouraged but
[1:20:01] there's also a judgment we have to do
[1:20:03] what he tells us to
[1:20:05] do and you know mothers God bless your
[1:20:10] heart have you picked up your clothes
[1:20:12] you know the kid wants to do something
[1:20:14] the first thing you say to him is have
[1:20:16] you picked up your clothes have you done
[1:20:18] have you fed the dog the cat whatever
[1:20:21] have you done this have you done that
[1:20:23] and you know what you repeat that thing
[1:20:25] how many
[1:20:26] times over and over have you done this
[1:20:30] you know you're wearing the
[1:20:32] monkey you should just tell the child do
[1:20:35] you have the freedom to go out and
[1:20:39] play right if you've already told them
[1:20:41] what to do then they take responsibility
[1:20:43] for what they're responsible for and
[1:20:45] then you just say do you have the
[1:20:46] freedom to do
[1:20:49] this you watch the wheels
[1:20:53] turn oh oh yeah now I
[1:20:56] see see so God expects
[1:21:00] you do you have the
[1:21:03] freedom you know how many times have I
[1:21:06] heard over the years oh God's been
[1:21:08] dealing with me over
[1:21:12] this well 35 years
[1:21:15] later come on man it's about time God
[1:21:18] quit dealing with you and you did
[1:21:20] it
[1:21:22] right so there has to to come a time to
[1:21:25] where you want to get right with God you
[1:21:26] want to do what the right thing is for
[1:21:28] God and so the Bible tells us in 2
[1:21:31] Corinthians 6 verse 17 it says wherefore
[1:21:34] come out from among them be ye separate
[1:21:36] sayeth the Lord touch not the unclean
[1:21:38] thing for I will receive you I will be a
[1:21:40] father unto you and ye shall be my sons
[1:21:42] and daughters sayith the almighty the
[1:21:45] Lord Almighty so God wants you to come
[1:21:48] away from the things of the world come
[1:21:50] closer to him and the closer you come to
[1:21:52] him the more privileges you
[1:21:55] have yeah things drop off but you got
[1:22:00] privileges
[1:22:03] right can I do one more rabbit Burl how
[1:22:06] much time
[1:22:08] I so I got into the prison to minister
[1:22:12] there and there was still one chaplain
[1:22:13] that was there that was uh 20 years ago
[1:22:16] that had kicked me out because of what
[1:22:18] we
[1:22:19] believed and I was going in under the
[1:22:21] volunteer person who was coordinating
[1:22:23] the volunteer he was headed of the
[1:22:24] chaplaincy she was head of the
[1:22:27] volunteers and
[1:22:30] uh the chaplain had sent word to her
[1:22:33] don't let that guy in the
[1:22:35] prison we kicked him out 20 years ago
[1:22:38] don't let him in he's got false Doctrine
[1:22:39] don't let him
[1:22:40] in and so uh she says to
[1:22:45] me what's the deal between you and the
[1:22:50] chaplain now I had learned from the guy
[1:22:53] who got me the interview inter which was
[1:22:55] a a chaplain a volunteer chaplain I had
[1:22:59] learned from him that she was a
[1:23:00] missionary child so her parents had been
[1:23:03] missionaries somewhere and and but she
[1:23:06] was no longer carrying on with a
[1:23:07] Christian experience and so I said to
[1:23:10] her well do you understand church
[1:23:12] history she says yes I do I said no you
[1:23:16] remember that in the Dark Ages we were
[1:23:18] all under Catholicism right she goes yes
[1:23:21] I I understand that and then there came
[1:23:22] a guy named Martin Luther who brought
[1:23:24] reformation and the light sprung out and
[1:23:27] the just shall live by faith and he he
[1:23:29] broke the Catholic Church apart and
[1:23:31] started the Lutheran Church well he
[1:23:33] didn't start it but the movement began
[1:23:35] from there she goes yeah I said I'm
[1:23:37] Martin
[1:23:39] Luther oh she says is that all it is
[1:23:41] come on
[1:23:45] in right so you know you can you can
[1:23:48] express things in a certain way that
[1:23:50] that people actually understand where
[1:23:52] you're coming from and appreciate it so
[1:23:54] we we need to realize that we have to
[1:23:56] have God dealing with us present day
[1:23:59] right rather than
[1:24:02] past and so brother Brown says you can't
[1:24:04] live in a rearview
[1:24:06] mirror you got to live in in today's
[1:24:09] society so as we begin to look at this
[1:24:12] thought here and we see he wants us to
[1:24:14] come away we realize now he wants us to
[1:24:17] judge
[1:24:19] ourselves so I don't know when you folks
[1:24:21] would have communion we have it once
[1:24:23] every other
[1:24:24] month first Sunday of every other month
[1:24:28] and that was a voted it's not my
[1:24:32] decision you know cuz when we had Co we
[1:24:35] even cut down from the one cup down to
[1:24:37] little
[1:24:38] cups once again I hope I'm not treading
[1:24:41] on toes here but um you know we'd had it
[1:24:44] one cup for 35 years and then all of a
[1:24:47] sudden we had to go down to one cup you
[1:24:49] know the little dinky thing and so but
[1:24:52] anyway that church voted upon it brother
[1:24:54] man says what the church votes is the
[1:24:55] Holy Ghost so we let we not my opinion
[1:25:00] anyway when we do First Corinthians 11
[1:25:03] when we talk about the communion in 1
[1:25:06] Corinthians 11 the Bible says at towards
[1:25:10] the end of it there he says in 1
[1:25:11] Corinthians 11:31 he says if we judge
[1:25:17] ourselves right so before you come to
[1:25:19] the communion you judge yourself correct
[1:25:21] amen right you you make sure that you've
[1:25:25] got things right you don't want to take
[1:25:27] that cup
[1:25:28] unworthily right so you make sure that
[1:25:30] you've got things fixed up between you
[1:25:33] and him or him and you you know you
[1:25:36] you've done everything you needed to do
[1:25:37] because when you come to that time of
[1:25:39] Judgment of the first communion or that
[1:25:41] communion time you you want it to be
[1:25:43] right you don't want to eat and drink
[1:25:45] damnation to yourself amen all with
[1:25:48] me okay so he says we judge ourselves we
[1:25:52] should not be judged so if I'm judging
[1:25:56] myself then I'm not going to come into
[1:25:58] any more
[1:25:59] judgment right because I'm a son and
[1:26:02] it's a present day judgment amen and
[1:26:05] it's also a judgment upon
[1:26:10] self I'm not telling you now I may be
[1:26:13] telling you by preaching but I'm not
[1:26:15] telling you directly and if I'm reading
[1:26:17] your
[1:26:18] mail I'm I'm just the
[1:26:21] Mailman right I'm not I didn't brother
[1:26:24] Ben didn't tell me anything about you
[1:26:27] okay so but you know so that's what
[1:26:29] happens we judge ourselves and it brings
[1:26:32] us to a place of repentance
[1:26:34] Hallelujah because that's what we want
[1:26:36] to do before we have the communion we
[1:26:37] want to repent right anything is wrong
[1:26:40] there we want to make it right but when
[1:26:43] we are judged we are chastened of the
[1:26:44] Lord that we should not be condemned to
[1:26:46] the world so we see that that now is a
[1:26:48] present day judgment and it's actually a
[1:26:52] repentance right I'm
[1:26:55] repenting so even though I repented of
[1:26:58] my sins and they've been dealt with I
[1:26:59] still have repentance I need to
[1:27:02] do that's still a part of my life but my
[1:27:06] sin that separated me has been dealt
[1:27:11] with so
[1:27:13] now as I look at that thought the Bible
[1:27:16] tells us in Acts 3: 19 it says repent
[1:27:20] therefore and be converted that your
[1:27:21] sins may be blotted out when the times
[1:27:23] of refreshing shall come from the
[1:27:25] presence of the Lord and we know that
[1:27:27] repentance is a total
[1:27:29] turnaround not just a half not a 90
[1:27:33] Dee but a 180 right go in a different
[1:27:38] direction okay the Bible also says that
[1:27:41] it should bring forth fruit meat for
[1:27:44] repentance so if you tell me that you
[1:27:47] know let me just put it this way I'm no
[1:27:49] longer going to
[1:27:51] smoke right
[1:27:54] I Repent of that well then I shouldn't
[1:27:56] see you
[1:27:56] smoking right I'm no longer going to
[1:27:59] drink I I shouldn't see you drinking you
[1:28:01] know I mean I'm trying to use something
[1:28:03] that I'm not going to step on anybody's
[1:28:07] toes anyway uh we we see then that it's
[1:28:11] a fruit coming from that and we know
[1:28:14] that Godly sorrow worketh
[1:28:18] repentance so if I realize what I've
[1:28:20] done to my Lord then I'm sorrowful for
[1:28:22] my Lord not because I got I got
[1:28:28] caught like I was telling you my sons
[1:28:30] the one would watch the other one and if
[1:28:33] the other one got in trouble the other
[1:28:35] one would say it was it was him dad I
[1:28:37] didn't do anything but he he might have
[1:28:39] done it but he started
[1:28:42] it right so he's he's shoving the thing
[1:28:45] over onto his brother so there's no
[1:28:48] Godly sorrow
[1:28:51] there right there has to be a Godly
[1:28:54] sorrow that's right and when I'm Godly
[1:28:57] sorrow I mean business yeah I mean
[1:29:00] business with
[1:29:02] God and then we should the Bible says
[1:29:05] forsake so Proverbs 28:13 says cover he
[1:29:09] that cover this him shall not Prosper
[1:29:11] but whosoever confesseth and forsaketh
[1:29:13] him shall have mercy so I confess it and
[1:29:18] then I forsake
[1:29:20] it I don't make provision for it yeah
[1:29:24] now I will slip and I will do things
[1:29:26] wrong and that's why we talk about with
[1:29:27] the anger resolution yeah you're going
[1:29:29] to have anger but we need to realize how
[1:29:31] I can resolve what I did
[1:29:36] wrong maybe you've had
[1:29:38] this over the years I've had guys come
[1:29:41] up to me you forgive me for what I've
[1:29:43] ever done to
[1:29:47] you which
[1:29:50] one right because you might have done
[1:29:53] quite a few but you were only thinking
[1:29:54] of
[1:29:55] one so it's always good to
[1:29:58] identify what you're asking sorry for or
[1:30:02] forgiveness
[1:30:03] for because if there's a multitude of
[1:30:06] them then which one is it and this is
[1:30:10] what I tell the guys with the man with
[1:30:11] their Partners I says you know don't let
[1:30:13] the sun go down upon your wrath right
[1:30:17] because you give a place for a devil you
[1:30:18] know that word place means a
[1:30:20] jurisdiction means a piece of
[1:30:22] ground you given them a piece of ground
[1:30:25] to work in and then the Bible says it's
[1:30:27] a
[1:30:28] stronghold and that stronghold stays
[1:30:30] there until you tear that stronghold
[1:30:34] down right so we see then that we
[1:30:37] realize that it's serious business we
[1:30:40] need to confess and
[1:30:42] forsake the sin if we do that hey I'm
[1:30:46] free free in the Lord then
[1:30:51] right okay so let's go a little further
[1:30:56] the next one is repentance but the next
[1:31:00] one is
[1:31:01] confession because I've seen many people
[1:31:06] repent and make somewhat of a confession
[1:31:09] but a True Confession brings forth the
[1:31:12] fruit and so the Bible tells us here as
[1:31:16] many as I love I rebuke and chasen be
[1:31:18] zealous therefore and repent right so we
[1:31:23] confess and the Bible says if we confess
[1:31:25] our sins he is faithful and just to
[1:31:27] forgive us of our sins and cleanse Us in
[1:31:29] all unrighteousness hey man I'm camping
[1:31:31] on that one amen that's that's
[1:31:34] underlined that's the one I want because
[1:31:37] you know there's many things I do that
[1:31:39] that that are
[1:31:42] wrong then the last one is
[1:31:50] chastisement because if you won't pay
[1:31:52] attention
[1:31:55] H then I got to chastise you that's God
[1:31:59] right not me but that's God he's got a
[1:32:01] chastise
[1:32:02] you you you look at
[1:32:05] Paul doing God's service without his
[1:32:08] will and God had to knock him down now I
[1:32:11] said he ride a horse my wife says he
[1:32:13] didn't ride a horse but every picture
[1:32:15] I've got of him he's riding a
[1:32:17] horse
[1:32:19] right that's the clip art that I've got
[1:32:22] so you know knocked him off his high
[1:32:24] horse and put him on the ground made him
[1:32:26] blind right because he thought he was
[1:32:28] doing the right thing so God had the
[1:32:30] only way he was going to turn him around
[1:32:32] was nail
[1:32:34] him right
[1:32:36] and sometimes that's
[1:32:39] you sometimes he's got to do something
[1:32:41] pretty drastic to you
[1:32:43] too and then other times it may not be
[1:32:46] for that right CU we had people tell us
[1:32:50] when when Chris
[1:32:52] died the only reason Chris died was
[1:32:54] because he didn't go to the gizor
[1:32:56] convention it was on an Easter Good
[1:32:58] Friday
[1:33:01] 1988 boy I tell you
[1:33:04] what I nearly laid that guy
[1:33:06] out that was before I started preaching
[1:33:08] anger resolution by the
[1:33:11] way but you know I nearly I you know I
[1:33:14] mean that that's the wrong thing to tell
[1:33:16] a dad yeah at the funeral home when
[1:33:19] you've just gone and looked at the body
[1:33:21] of your son right 21 year old boy
[1:33:24] so you know it was it was tough going
[1:33:27] but we realize that sometimes God does
[1:33:30] things in chastisement to get your
[1:33:36] attention and he wants you to be
[1:33:41] faithful not successful and we'll deal
[1:33:44] with this in a few moments it's not
[1:33:47] about how much you do it's whether
[1:33:49] you're faithful in what you do
[1:33:54] I'm counting on that
[1:33:56] too okay so we've got this far let's
[1:34:00] bring her down the home stretch so the
[1:34:02] Bible says in Hebrews
[1:34:04] 12:5 have you forgotten the exhortation
[1:34:07] that speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:34:10] my son despise not the chastening of the
[1:34:12] Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:34:15] him for whom the Lord loveth he
[1:34:17] chasteneth and he scourgeth every son
[1:34:19] whom he receiveth if you endure
[1:34:22] chastising God deal with you as sons and
[1:34:26] for what son is he whom the father
[1:34:27] chasteneth not so now we're dealing with
[1:34:31] chastisement in our lives
[1:34:35] right should be happening on a pretty
[1:34:37] regular
[1:34:38] basis some of you are able to confess
[1:34:41] right away some of you able to repent
[1:34:43] right away but others of you are as hard
[1:34:45] as hard can
[1:34:47] be but you're a son you're a daughter so
[1:34:52] he's not going to let you go yeah he's
[1:34:54] just going to have to do something more
[1:34:56] get your
[1:34:59] attention so the Bible says here that
[1:35:02] the chastisement is not for the payment
[1:35:04] of
[1:35:07] sin not for the payment of sin it's
[1:35:10] because you're doing
[1:35:12] wrong so give you an example
[1:35:16] here as a young boy I played
[1:35:20] baseball and uh we played in our
[1:35:24] street and I hit the ball and I broke
[1:35:27] the neighbor's
[1:35:30] window
[1:35:32] now the spanking didn't pay for the
[1:35:37] window right it only chastised me for
[1:35:40] doing
[1:35:41] wrong the window still had to be paid
[1:35:45] for so when God chastises his child it's
[1:35:48] not for the payment of sin but it's
[1:35:50] because Jesus Paid For That sin
[1:35:53] but because you're a son he's not going
[1:35:55] to let you get away with it you've got
[1:35:57] to make it
[1:35:59] right so just saying would you forgive
[1:36:02] me well which
[1:36:04] one because if I'm if you if I really
[1:36:07] want forgiveness from this person I'm
[1:36:09] going to itemize what you remember that
[1:36:11] time and I you and I and I kind of
[1:36:14] smacked you up alongside the head or
[1:36:15] something you remember that time you
[1:36:17] know I if I identify what we're talking
[1:36:21] about all of a sudden I can see okay now
[1:36:25] I can forgive him because he's he's
[1:36:27] wearing what he did
[1:36:29] wrong and that's what happens in the
[1:36:31] prison is I talked to them I said now
[1:36:34] you remember how your wife when you and
[1:36:35] her get in an argument or your partner
[1:36:37] because they're not many of them have
[1:36:38] wives anymore uh they
[1:36:43] they I said when you guys get in an
[1:36:45] argument she'll drag up stuff that was
[1:36:47] five years ago or 10 years ago yeah you
[1:36:52] did this to me
[1:36:55] yeah but what about when you did that to
[1:36:57] me you know and so we get this thing
[1:37:00] going and we say the Bible says don't
[1:37:02] let the sun go down upon your wrath
[1:37:04] because if you do it builds a stronghold
[1:37:07] and now you you're you got a stronghold
[1:37:11] and Satan comes out of that stronghold
[1:37:13] and torments you all the time and you
[1:37:15] come up you get prayed
[1:37:17] for every gizor convention Margie you
[1:37:20] remember this every gizor convention to
[1:37:23] be the same On's coming forward for
[1:37:24] prayer right and and what was wrong we
[1:37:29] didn't break the
[1:37:30] stronghold we only dealt with a surface
[1:37:32] problem fear anxiety pain whatever it
[1:37:35] might be well you got to break the
[1:37:37] stronghold you got to get the ground
[1:37:39] back yeah because he's got a right to
[1:37:42] stay there remember brother Braham said
[1:37:44] you cast a demon off somebody and and
[1:37:47] God put it there he said you're in
[1:37:50] trouble because God put it there for a
[1:37:52] reason right so we need to know what
[1:37:55] that is and confession and repentance
[1:37:59] and chastisement is God's way of
[1:38:01] bringing us to that place wow so don't
[1:38:05] despise the chastising of the Lord so
[1:38:08] what did job do
[1:38:10] wrong well he didn't do anything wrong
[1:38:13] right but you know what he did wrong
[1:38:15] have you ever figured it out I think
[1:38:17] it's chapter
[1:38:19] 4 job's talking about all the things
[1:38:21] that have gone wrong he says the very
[1:38:23] thing I feared Came Upon me yeah so it
[1:38:28] was his fear not trust in the Lord yeah
[1:38:31] his fear Came Upon
[1:38:33] him so it wasn't God wanted that fear
[1:38:37] out God wanted him to trust him and no
[1:38:39] matter what was going to happen so he
[1:38:41] had to allow something to happen so that
[1:38:44] job would come to a place where he could
[1:38:45] trust him and then you see in
[1:38:48] chapter is it
[1:38:50] 19 well one point he says though he slay
[1:38:53] me yet I'll trust him amen the other
[1:38:55] point I know my redeemer liveth right
[1:38:58] why he he crossed over now he he got to
[1:39:01] a place to where he' made things right
[1:39:02] with God and he crossed over and he oh
[1:39:05] GL and in the latter days he'll stand
[1:39:07] upon the Earth and though the skin worms
[1:39:09] eat my flesh yet in my flesh I'll see my
[1:39:11] God
[1:39:12] right so no fear right you got fear deal
[1:39:17] with it we can help you if we if we can
[1:39:20] but yeah you still got to deal with that
[1:39:22] thing okay let's move on to the last
[1:39:24] part here let me just validate this so
[1:39:29] in Galatians 4 Galatians the 4th chapter
[1:39:33] first to uh F first one to five verses
[1:39:38] gives a beautiful picture of it how that
[1:39:40] we're under the tutor so on but now when
[1:39:44] this child was born he became a son the
[1:39:47] very moment he was born in the family he
[1:39:50] he got it now then there was a tutor
[1:39:53] over the boy to educate him to raise him
[1:39:56] up well he was no more than a servant as
[1:40:00] the gal letter until he came to an age a
[1:40:05] certain time that he was set and this
[1:40:09] tutor would would always take the
[1:40:11] father's word your son is progressing
[1:40:15] right or whatever it was whoop I went
[1:40:19] went the wrong way did I
[1:40:25] yeah I did
[1:40:28] sorry
[1:40:30] okay oh
[1:40:32] wow
[1:40:33] uh Escape hit escape on that for mine
[1:40:37] will you we i' I've got lost I I I know
[1:40:41] I'm old and let's go back to uh maybe
[1:40:46] let's see what I can see here let's go
[1:40:48] back to
[1:40:49] 67 there yeah just double click it there
[1:40:53] okay speaking of K Baner right I think I
[1:40:56] can go forward
[1:41:00] now right yep okay I'll come to it
[1:41:05] now so we see now that he's judging us
[1:41:08] as Sons as in Galatians
[1:41:11] 4 now as we go a little further with
[1:41:14] this thought now we come to this this
[1:41:17] last one because we've been under child
[1:41:19] training and so in Galatians 4:1 there
[1:41:22] was this child training that was going
[1:41:24] to take place and the way it was done
[1:41:26] was
[1:41:27] chastisement so he brought us to that
[1:41:30] place of chastisement in order to bring
[1:41:32] us into that full sunship so that that
[1:41:35] our name on the check is as good as
[1:41:39] his now you see where where Sandy sister
[1:41:43] Sandy was getting it from because if I'm
[1:41:46] in the right position with God my name
[1:41:48] is as good although I personally I
[1:41:53] wouldn't do that but still I see the
[1:41:57] principle right okay so let's go a
[1:42:00] little
[1:42:01] further take it to the next
[1:42:04] spot we're going to take it now to to a
[1:42:07] future let me get this out of the
[1:42:10] way take it to the Future now and with
[1:42:13] the future then becomes we are judged as
[1:42:16] a
[1:42:18] servant okay let's go
[1:42:21] to uh 2 Corinthians 5:10 to fill in this
[1:42:26] last
[1:42:27] one so in 2 Corinthians
[1:42:32] 5 verse
[1:42:39] 10 so we're going to take responsibility
[1:42:42] to have our confessions and our efforts
[1:42:45] to do
[1:42:46] right and then we we come
[1:42:50] to 2 Corinthians 5:10 for we must all
[1:42:54] appear before the Judgment seat of
[1:42:56] Christ that everyone may receive the
[1:42:59] things done in his body according to
[1:43:01] that Heath done whether it is good or
[1:43:05] bad now this is the Judgment seat of
[1:43:07] Christ this is not the white Throne
[1:43:09] judgment now brother brandham had the
[1:43:12] dream do you remember this where he had
[1:43:14] the dream where uh his name was called
[1:43:18] I'm going to paraphrase it his name was
[1:43:20] called and he starts to go forward
[1:43:23] and hope comes into one hand and he
[1:43:26] steps a little bit further and mey comes
[1:43:28] into the other hand so what happened he
[1:43:30] went to the rewards for what he had
[1:43:34] done they're Broms no they weren't Broms
[1:43:38] brother they weren't blood related
[1:43:40] they're you and I believing the message
[1:43:42] right that's what he saw behind him is
[1:43:44] as a reward so we we see then this is
[1:43:47] what we're talking about it's not a
[1:43:49] judgment to judge you for sin and wrong
[1:43:52] necessarily but because you have put it
[1:43:54] under the blood and you're serving God
[1:43:56] now you're going to be judged as a
[1:43:57] servant of God and as you're judged as a
[1:44:00] servant of God we see that uh we all
[1:44:03] come before the Judgment seat of God now
[1:44:06] important now to go to 1 Corinthians 3:
[1:44:09] 11 so as you go to 1 Corinthians 3:1
[1:44:12] we're talking about a future judgment
[1:44:14] and first thing we're going to deal with
[1:44:16] here and we're just almost done so stay
[1:44:18] with
[1:44:20] me watch this is a this is so good
[1:44:23] I trust you'll see it way that way as
[1:44:25] well 1 Corinthians 3:1 11 sorry for the
[1:44:29] foundation can no man lay than that is
[1:44:32] laid which is Jesus Christ so your
[1:44:35] foundation must be in Jesus Christ amen
[1:44:39] not the message not because I believe a
[1:44:41] prophet not because I believe serpent
[1:44:43] seed not because I believe Doctrine it's
[1:44:45] because I believe Jesus Christ paid for
[1:44:47] my sin that's that's where my Foundation
[1:44:49] has to be CU watch watch as we go
[1:44:52] further with this
[1:44:54] now if any man build upon this
[1:44:58] Foundation gold silver precious
[1:45:02] stones wood hay stubble so we got six
[1:45:07] things that you're going to build
[1:45:09] on so what are we dealing with here
[1:45:12] we're dealing with a judgment but it's
[1:45:14] being judged on service of what I built
[1:45:21] with interesting let's go a little
[1:45:24] further verse 13 Every Man's work shall
[1:45:27] be made manifest for the day shall
[1:45:29] declare it it shall be revealed by fire
[1:45:32] and the fire shall try every man's work
[1:45:35] what sort it
[1:45:36] is ah so now my works are going to be
[1:45:41] judged at a
[1:45:44] fire and the fire is generally the fiery
[1:45:47] Trials of your
[1:45:49] faith right what am I doing with each
[1:45:52] trial that God sends me how am I how am
[1:45:55] I handling it am I taking it back to the
[1:45:57] Lord right so it's not a it's it's a
[1:46:00] service of works and we see here gold
[1:46:04] silver precious stones hay wood hay
[1:46:08] stubble what happens with
[1:46:11] fire fire with those first three only
[1:46:14] make them better fire with the second
[1:46:17] three they get burned up
[1:46:24] okay let's go a little further verse 14
[1:46:28] and if any man's work
[1:46:30] abides okay something's going to hold it
[1:46:32] through if any man's work
[1:46:35] abides which he has built thereupon he
[1:46:39] shall receive a
[1:46:41] reward so the fire is what's going to
[1:46:44] test the
[1:46:45] work let's go a little further verse 15
[1:46:49] if any man's Works shall be burned he
[1:46:52] shall suffer loss but he himself shall
[1:46:55] be saved yet so by
[1:46:57] fire
[1:47:00] ah a penny
[1:47:02] dropped so over the years I baptized
[1:47:06] over 200 people you know I so many of
[1:47:08] them over 40 years it's hard for me to
[1:47:10] count I got about 40 there
[1:47:13] now so what's happened to them all well
[1:47:15] I don't know what's happened to them
[1:47:17] all but if they were I baptized them
[1:47:21] right right in the name of the Lord
[1:47:24] Jesus Christ I made sure that they
[1:47:26] received Christ as their savior so no
[1:47:28] matter what they do now what they build
[1:47:30] upon is their
[1:47:32] business and it will be Tried by
[1:47:35] fire but if it gets burnt
[1:47:38] up and their Foundation was
[1:47:41] good it'll
[1:47:43] stay that's why you see the foolish
[1:47:46] Church come up in Revelation
[1:47:48] 7 who are these These are they who G
[1:47:51] through Great Tribulation and made their
[1:47:53] robes white through the blood of the
[1:47:55] Lamb why because their Works got
[1:47:59] burnt but they love the
[1:48:01] Lord they may have been baptized right
[1:48:04] they may not have been but they love the
[1:48:06] Lord so you know you can't judge
[1:48:08] somebody because God's still gonna he's
[1:48:11] still got a foolish church
[1:48:13] somewhere so we see here that the man
[1:48:17] will suffer LOF but he shall be saved by
[1:48:19] fire okay let's let's look at the other
[1:48:21] part of this verse
[1:48:24] here so now we're dealing with in verse
[1:48:29] 15 is it yeah verse 15 if any man's
[1:48:32] Works shall be burned he shall suffer
[1:48:33] loss but he himself shall be saved by
[1:48:35] fire so when we look at this thought
[1:48:38] here we realize that his works it's
[1:48:41] really dealing with the Judgment of what
[1:48:44] sort it is so we see here in verse 12
[1:48:48] for If any man will build upon this
[1:48:50] Foundation gold silver precious stones
[1:48:52] wood hay or stubble so that's dealing
[1:48:54] with the sort or the size not the size
[1:48:58] the
[1:48:59] sort so even if I have a small church
[1:49:01] that don't make any
[1:49:03] difference if I have a large church more
[1:49:06] trouble
[1:49:07] but but it's not dealing with with size
[1:49:10] it's dealing what are you building
[1:49:13] with right so when when I first got
[1:49:16] started I ran at an old Methodist Church
[1:49:19] and I I got a little catchy phrase I'm
[1:49:21] preaching the seventh Angel's message in
[1:49:23] the six Message Church six Angel message
[1:49:25] church right didn't mean a whole lot but
[1:49:28] you know you like to have these little
[1:49:30] catchy phrases shakina of glory and all
[1:49:32] these things that we use you know we
[1:49:33] have these little catchy phrases that we
[1:49:35] use no
[1:49:37] offense I preach every place twice at
[1:49:40] least I preach and then I have to go
[1:49:43] back and say I'm sorry for what I
[1:49:45] preach okay so we we see here that that
[1:49:49] the Bible tells us it's not what the
[1:49:51] size
[1:49:53] so it's God's not dealing on size he
[1:49:56] said what are you
[1:49:58] preaching so it's not un
[1:50:01] success it's where I'm serving God is
[1:50:04] God real in my heart do I want him
[1:50:06] active in my life that's what God's
[1:50:08] dealing
[1:50:09] with that's the sort I'm dealing with
[1:50:12] precious stones gold silver that's only
[1:50:14] going to get better with the fire hey
[1:50:17] wouldn't stubble be burnt
[1:50:20] up okay let me finish it off with this
[1:50:22] is thought here's brother Brandon this I
[1:50:25] believe is every
[1:50:28] pastor and then at that day of the
[1:50:31] rewards given
[1:50:32] out God's standing there I hope I'm
[1:50:35] standing near with my hands up screaming
[1:50:38] to see him place the crown upon your
[1:50:42] head that's where we want to stand as
[1:50:45] ministers with our congregation sitting
[1:50:48] there and watch you come forward your
[1:50:49] name's called Hallelujah they made it I
[1:50:52] don't know how they they did it but they
[1:50:53] made it
[1:50:55] right that's what we want right that's
[1:50:57] that's that's our heart's desire is to
[1:50:59] see people make it I mean we're we're
[1:51:01] not in this for the money Silver and
[1:51:03] Gold Have I None amen such as I have
[1:51:06] give by thee right haven't had a raise
[1:51:09] in 10
[1:51:09] years but Silver and Gold Have I None
[1:51:12] such as I give have give I Thee that's
[1:51:14] where we want to be so now we told you
[1:51:18] what we're going to say and everything
[1:51:19] now we're going to ask you the question
[1:51:23] okay out of this chart where do you
[1:51:28] stand where are you on this chart are
[1:51:31] you still not serving God have you not
[1:51:34] asked the Lord into your
[1:51:36] life this is your opportunity to receive
[1:51:42] Christ it's your call you see the
[1:51:45] judgments of God you saw how it
[1:51:49] works you see that it's not going to be
[1:51:51] a bed of roses
[1:51:53] everything's going to go you know once I
[1:51:54] give me eyes to Christ it's going to be
[1:51:55] fine I mean there is a time of honeymoon
[1:51:57] time sure but then comes the hard
[1:52:00] yards yeah man I I told you I thought I
[1:52:03] was a young man I thought I was going to
[1:52:04] take the thing into the Rapture and here
[1:52:06] we are who would believe we'd be
[1:52:09] 2024 I worked on the sheep station in in
[1:52:13] 70s 72 in Hawks Bay there and every post
[1:52:17] we put in the ground this will do to
[1:52:21] 77 well 77 is come and gone long ago
[1:52:24] right but we weren't reading what
[1:52:26] brother brandham said he said this is
[1:52:28] not prophecy this is I predict because I
[1:52:31] see things happening and look I can
[1:52:32] predict right now who would believe that
[1:52:36] Israel could send off an explosion by
[1:52:38] somebody wearing a
[1:52:41] pager surely the Lord's
[1:52:44] coming right yeah he's very close and
[1:52:48] then a cell
[1:52:50] phone okay so where are you
[1:52:53] where are you
[1:52:55] standing then are you judged are you
[1:53:00] judging your own
[1:53:04] sin and the next one is are you being
[1:53:08] chastised by the
[1:53:14] Lord don't go quiet on me now come
[1:53:18] on and then finally will you have a
[1:53:22] reward is the Judgment seat of
[1:53:25] Christ right so I'm not talking about
[1:53:27] size I'm talking about sword see he
[1:53:30] didn't call you to be successful he
[1:53:33] called you to be faithful
[1:53:39] amen one last thought in SE 87 we've
[1:53:43] been going for about four years and
[1:53:46] things had kind of plateaued and I
[1:53:48] thought we Revival was going to strike
[1:53:50] and you know because you know in America
[1:53:53] as children we're taught that you could
[1:53:55] be president of the United
[1:53:57] States I don't know how that would be
[1:54:00] well I guess anybody could be if Trump's
[1:54:02] going to be right but uh you know we're
[1:54:06] taught that you can do anything just put
[1:54:08] your nose to the wheel and do it and I
[1:54:10] you kiwis are not a lot way different
[1:54:12] than that you know there's a lot of
[1:54:13] kiwis that spend hard time working
[1:54:16] right but things are plateaued so I
[1:54:21] called a guy named Ted Pedley he's still
[1:54:25] around and uh I had him come out to hold
[1:54:27] Revival because he was an
[1:54:29] evangelist and we were having these
[1:54:32] revivals down at the old church there
[1:54:34] white cuckoo and uh we had a beach house
[1:54:38] at that time because we lived on the
[1:54:39] farm so we had a beach house and he was
[1:54:42] staying in the beach house during the
[1:54:44] day we'd pick him up go to service bring
[1:54:45] him back feed him B him down then he
[1:54:48] would spend the day at the beach house
[1:54:50] he came to me he says this morning I was
[1:54:52] out on the beach walking thinking about
[1:54:55] what the Lord wanted me to
[1:54:56] do he came to me and he said to me this
[1:55:00] whole thing is because if you if there's
[1:55:02] no Revival after this you're going to
[1:55:05] shut
[1:55:09] down I said yeah that's what I put
[1:55:12] before the Lord he said I want you to
[1:55:15] know something this has helped me all
[1:55:16] these years right he says God didn't
[1:55:19] call you to be
[1:55:20] successful he called you to to be
[1:55:23] faithful just keep doing what's right
[1:55:26] amen God will bring the success one way
[1:55:29] or the other and so you know he knows
[1:55:32] what we can stand he knows what we're
[1:55:33] able to take care of he knows exactly
[1:55:35] what's going to happen so let God just
[1:55:38] trust
[1:55:39] him Proverbs 3:5 the maybe one of the
[1:55:42] first scriptures you ever learned trust
[1:55:43] in the Lord with all your heart lean not
[1:55:45] on your own understanding in all thy
[1:55:47] ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct
[1:55:49] thy paths right just trust am
[1:55:53] and you know we just over in
[1:55:56] vanatu over in vanatu with the 50th of
[1:55:59] the Jubilee celebration for the message
[1:56:01] going to the to the uh vanatu this
[1:56:05] February
[1:56:08] March and brother Moy is the pastor at
[1:56:12] at Port V and um I've known him for a
[1:56:16] lot of years I started going there in
[1:56:17] 1995 so I was one of the few surviving
[1:56:20] guys that had been going there the
[1:56:21] longest so they asked me to come and do
[1:56:23] this celebration ceremony with brother
[1:56:25] Ron Peterson and uh brother Moy I told
[1:56:28] Brother Moy as he says we need to hear
[1:56:30] that because what happens with these
[1:56:33] guys you know island people when they
[1:56:36] when they have a pastor he's the king he
[1:56:39] gets the best food he gets the nice car
[1:56:43] he gets all the nice things right and so
[1:56:46] they a lot of guys want to be Pastor
[1:56:48] because they want all those things and
[1:56:50] he says you know we need to realize
[1:56:52] realiz that we need to be
[1:56:54] faithful rather than
[1:56:57] successful and so you today you be
[1:57:01] faithful amen and on that day I'll be
[1:57:04] there hey praise the Lord they made how
[1:57:08] I don't know how but they did it praise
[1:57:10] God what a wonderful thing huh GL let's
[1:57:14] stand

[1:57:37] that you could identify
[1:57:39] with you can see where you're at and you
[1:57:42] can see how God is dealing with
[1:57:47] you and some of you are
[1:57:50] thick you know keep with have a kiwi
[1:57:52] saying you're thick as two
[1:57:54] post but you know God still can deal
[1:57:57] with you if you come to that repentance
[1:58:00] right and and confession and and say God
[1:58:04] I I all I want to do is be faithful put
[1:58:06] me in a church somewhere where I can
[1:58:08] just be the doorkeeper at the house of
[1:58:10] God rather than the tents of the wicked
