bless you and your wife good to see you again amen amen let's go to the scripture shall we this morning let's let's go to second kings and chapter five oh man i trust everyone's well today amen amen second kings five and then we're gonna go to um so i don't have a slideshow you know man i don't know how we used to do it when we were younger having a baby we'll get there though we'll get back into it you know remember brother andy one of us had we're on one of us was on the words with a baby then someone was song leaving with swap over and amen those are good days amen but these are good days too but yeah i think back off man how did we do that eh oh boy amen praise the lord amen but the lord's good all the time isn't he amen second kings five and for from verse one down to verse four then we're going to go to second corinthians five now naaman the captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the lord had given deliverance under syria and he was also a mighty man in valor but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of land of israel a little maid and she waited on naaman's wife and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy and one went in and told his lord saying thus anna said the maid that is of the land of israel and the king of syria said go go to go and i'll send a letter under the king of israel and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten charges of raymond i mean let's go to second corinthians five um just for a bit of a context here second corinthians 5 and 18 to 21. amen sing corinthians 5 18 and 20. it's always great to have brother mana sister bethany here too amen god bless you amen great to have you amen 2 corinthians 5 um 5 and from verse 18 and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as as though god did beseech you i mean and as though god to beseech you by us we pray you and christ dead be ye reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him amen what a verse hallelujah amen let's just bow heads in the word of prayer if you want to be remembered to pray i want to raise your hand to the lord this morning gracious lord jesus we want to thank you for this moment lord we want to thank you we can gather this morning lord under your under the shadow of thy wing oh god and i just prayed lord may your presence be very real among us lord we want to thank you lord that lord jesus your maids sin for us that we would be made the very righteousness of god in christ lord jesus what a great exchange lord and you gave it to us without money or price lord is free gift given lord and we freely receive it lord jesus and i pray father for anyone here who hasn't received that gift of eternal life lord of your righteousness may they receive it lord this morning lord may he change them oh god and dear god we just want to pray father you see lord every hand that's raised and we know lord that this world is in a great need lord jesus our personal lives we have great needs lord and i pray you'd meet those needs but father we we just want to think of this world at this moment dear god lord there's many many are a sick lord in this world fathers covert 19 and many other sicknesses of lord are just running rampant upon the globe lord we're going to pray lord for your bride around the world oh god may you strengthen and heal her and character oh god and father lord deliver her not just her but lord every every suffering one of adam's fallen race oh god father may you grant it dear lord jesus and lord we just also want to pray for brother um who's ministering your word lord up and fielding lord this morning lord may it be a mighty powerhouse service i pray lord may you visit them oh god in an incredible way this morning may bless them lord bless him in his ministry there lord father may you grant it and we commit the service into your hands for your glory in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you may have your seats this morning and if i could title this i'd like to speak about god's mouth peace now we want to we are as the scripture said we are ambassadors for christ now if we're ambassadors for christ all of heaven is behind us but i just want to go into this little girl who would who was who was taken and into taken into neyman's neyman's house you know she was a slave girl but god had placed her there as an ambassador for for him many times we we look at the situation of our life and we always think it's not ideal but to god it's ideal i mean to god that's where he wants you to be that's that's that's the place he wants you to be in i mean he's not panicking where you are he knows where you are and he placed you there hallelujah so and you know it's amazing when you think about a a ambassador you know you think that they normally just say if the ambassador of the united states would come into a country or you know they would come with great pomp and great ceremony or you know air force one or whatever plane would land and you'd be a big thing you know but god he doesn't he doesn't uh he doesn't put forth his ambassadors that way he puts them forth in meekness and in humbleness and humility amen you know we know the gospel it doesn't shine it glows it's a different kind of life that comes forth and you know god would god would wrap his ambassadors or or or rather the outward appearance of his ambassadors is very different to how the world would view an ambassador you know if i was the ambassador of new zealand i'd go speak to another country my suit would be pressed my tie would be just right you know my shoes would be shining my hair would be cut just right you know i would i'd be the most presentable i could be and there's nothing wrong with that that's a good thing but it's just more of an outward thing but but to be an ambassador for christ is all inward amen so here was this little girl that was taken you know and and and and she was a slave you know she was taken from her family you know she did not choose to be there and if if we had our way maybe we would probably choose another life if we could have it you know but god chose you to to to be where you are in this morning and this may seem very general but i just want you to think about it god knows where he wanted you to be and you are where he wants you to be hallelujah i mean so so here she is she's a slave girl she you know faced great difficulties you know she was taken from her family maybe very loving family you know but but they instilled something in her life i mean that that jehovah god of israel was the real god he was a living god he wasn't just a god or a local god he was the god i mean he was the creator of heavens and earth and they put that in her and then now when great trial came up in naaman's house i mean though though he was an enemy though he was an enemy of of of her nation of her family and it was actually really his orders that caused her to become a slave i mean but when great crisis came into that home she could step into that role as an ambassador and say the right things i mean no doubt she could have been been been weeping for joy because now vengeance had come up with judgment had now come upon the enemy of israel but she she wasn't that kind of ambassador i mean and and we are not those kind of ambassadors either i mean our highest desire is that every man woman and child will be reconciled to god everyone would know him in the power of his resurrection amen and we know that if if we are an ambassador amen we don't just sit still i mean we have a message to declare we have a life to live we have a message from the king not just an earthly king but the king that jesus lives i mean he's alive forevermore that this word works yes amen it'll it'll transform the most violent sinner doesn't matter where we're from it'll transform someone just raised in church it'll change them forever more this word works i mean it's not just an empty promise but it really works you know a lot of ambassadors they go to the u.n and they make a lot of bluffs and they make just a lot of empty words and and a lot of the countries there know that they're just bluffing because they actually know more about their country than they do themselves and their military capability and all those things but we don't just make an empty bluff i mean the bride has something backing her up i mean it's not a bluff it's not a put on it's not photoshopped it's not you know a filter put in to make it look more powerful this word works hallelujah it'll work in our lives if we just let it work okay man so here she was she was a slave girl she was fa she you know she faced great difficulty but she had one line to give this was her moment nothing else was recorded in the scripture that she said but god had to place her in that household amen as a slave girl to give a message to to to a great leader in syria and it's so amazing where where you know she just says that i would to god that he would be with the prophet in in in israel that was all she said that was her line hello that's all she said that's all she needed to say many times we think our lives are not significant they hold no weight they're not going to be remembered then you know they're not important you're very important to god you're very important to god we know that one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds holly you can't quantify we're priceless you can't you can't ensure of the bride of christ hallelujah you know your great pieces of artwork there comes a point where they just become priceless they can't actually put a figure behind that piece of artwork or that great piece of antiquity because it's priceless it can never be replaced we are irreplaceable hallelujah in god's mind you're irreplaceable i mean that's why he didn't just you know when when the penalty of sin had to be paid i mean he didn't just send a prophet or someone else to do it he came himself holy just like the three hebrew children that going into the father nebuchadnezzar's day he says to the angels you know you know brother brown would dramatize it and he would he would say now you know as they're being carried or as they're walking into the furnace let's look up a bit higher and he and he said let's shift the camera up and see because when things are going on on the earth things are happening in heaven harley you must always remember our life god is watching over us and and god is on his great big throne his great royal robes there and his majesty and he's and then and and then gabriel comes up to him he says good master have you been watching what's happening there in babylon your children are your children who have stood for you they're going to be thrown into that furnace let me go down there i'll just wipe them off the map i'll wipe babylon off the map he could have done it he could have done it but then god said no no gabriel you're a good angel you've been faithful to me ever since the day i created you but i can't let you go down so gabriel being a faithful angel put his sword back in its scabbard stood to attention and then wormwood came along master or great king of glory don't you see what's going on in babylon three of your children are going to be burning a fire they've made a stand for you i i flooded the world in the days of noah you let me do it i can flood babylon and save them he could have done it but god said god said to woman woman you're a good angel you've been faithful since i created you you didn't fall to satan's lie but i can't let you go down there and do it so and then and then god said no no no this is not an angel-sized job this is a god-sized job otherwise he said i'm going to go down myself and right at the right moment he stepped down into the fiery furnace and his children had a jubilee in his presence and the bands that they were the complexes the hurts the bands the intimidation they were bound with amen all the fight it was loosely from their trouble and they walked out free hallelujah amen so we gotta just rejoice you know oh i'm like i'm people say oh i'm living in a pressure cooker at the moment you need to be in that pressure cooker it's for your good it's not because god is mad with you no god's willing to prove himself in your life god's willing to deliver you from your trouble hallelujah like you know daniel was an incredible ambassador there's more than just one line written about him but he always had trouble all the way through his life the scripture would tell us that man's you know you know man is you know few days on the earth and it's full of sorrow hallelujah why are you saying hallelujah because if we're going through trouble well we're meant to go through trouble doesn't mean we just sit there and feel sorry for ourselves though we're ambassadors amen we're god is it god has has ordained us he's commissioned us he sent us forth hardly as ambassadors for himself now it's incredible when you think about ambassadors before they leave to a big meeting they'll have a they'll have a um they'll have a what they call it a a meeting in their own government before they go and the head of state and the different agencies will will will brief them on things this is our official position just like this say talks nuclear talks with iran or north korea whatever it is america would say this is our position and they'll have their briefing and now the ambition that the ambassador has to remember what the orders of the briefing are and he's got to speak by a memory what what his head of state has told him he has to speak by memory but for us it's not that way amen we don't have to remember what the king said amen and then come give forth the message from our king no our king goes in us and it's him that's speaking amen as as jesus would tell the disciples when you are brought before synagogues and and different things and you know courts and different things don't think of what to say my father will teach you what to say he'll put the words in your mouth so it's not you trying to remember it amen god will speak through you hallelujah so we're a different kind of ambassador to a natural ambassador because our king goes in us he's not in some foreign place he's not just in heaven brother braham says dead he's not just in heaven it's in you amen amen to the king hey hallelujah he's the one who who comes through us now daniel was an incredible ambassador as i was saying daniel would daniel would make up his mind before he left jerusalem i'm going to serve god wherever god sends me yeah it's amazing you know god has to have a witness in this day hallelujah god has to have a witness and he's put us here to be a witness and daniel had to be a witness in babylon that was his assignment he would never have picked going there but that's where he was sent hallelujah and so daniel went through an incredible things in his life and there was a lot of struggles there was a lot of turmoil you know he had to he had to walk in a political arena you know other you know even when he became basically the second in the kingdom the other princes i mean were were were trying to get rid of him and so he was going through a pressure cooker where he had to be careful with what he said and how he conducted himself and no doubt they'd try and trap him in his words and all these things they couldn't do it but then they realized his source of strength they realized his source of strength was his prayer to god his communion with god is what kept him walking in that way so now they they they tricked the king now we all know these stories don't we trick the king into in into writing a decree no man can pray to any god or any other man but you for 30 days or however long it was but daniel had made up his mind i'm an ambassador all of heaven's behind me hallelujah so so here he goes he prays he gets caught he's going to be thrown in the lion stand he gets thrown in the lion's den the there the enemies of daniel had no idea that the purpose that they actually rose up to try and destroy daniel in this way is that they would be destroyed remember the lion's den brought freedom for daniel from his enemies because remember before the lion's den they were attacking him trying to destroy him but after the lion's den they got thrown in the lines then so i'm going through a trial it's actually to just destroy the things that are trying to destroy you hallelujah all things work together for good are you with me so you know we don't need to be down about just rejoice i'm throwing in the lines in but you'll get out i'm in a dark place you'll get out i'm in the devil's trying to destroy me you'll get out hallelujah so don't despair remember if god can bring you thus far he'll take you all the way if he can bring you out of the world he'll take you all the way amen if he can save you he can save others hallelujah amen so so so the slave girl in naaman's house had one line but it's so impacted they probably would have had other slaves in the house they would have maybe said some other things but she said that that's incredible when you think about that statement i wish he was with the prophet in israel or samaria that was the enemy's place you know but she somehow just so knew if he could just get to that prophet amen he would be made well and just that that one phrase she was a faithful ambassador and she spoke that and it so moved on whoever heard it and it so moved on name and somehow he believed it too that he went his way and we know the rest of the story he came back not a leper hallelujah but the thing is now you think here's this little girl she's an ambassador for the god of glory why isn't she dressed up in great big robes and maybe came on a great big golden chariot and stopped outside damon's house with fine arabian horses leading it and you know all these things that's not how god operates that's how man operates that's not how god operates when god would have a um would allow moses to build him a tabernacle it was it was wrapped in badger skins it was not wrapped in the finest of skins badger skins hallelujah and god was projecting through that actually this is really to the world i mean what what what my ambassadors will look like they will not be the finest people they will not be the greatest people they won't be the most beautiful or handsome or whatever as the world would say but they are my ambassadors if we would just look at you know many people have reconstructed that um tabernacle it doesn't look like much does it it's a tent that's really all it is it's just a tent but yet almighty god decided this is where i'm gonna dwell hallelujah and we look in the mirror sometimes and we we think oh boy but we're ambassadors amen don't worry about don't worry about the outward amen hallelujah now the apostles would would would stand before the sanhedrin and they would say they were asked what shall we they said you know they said to them by what power or by what name have you done this healing the man by the gate beautiful and they begin to tell them this is who we this is the name and this is the power that we have raised this man up in the name of jesus christ so here were the ambassadors for christ in that day hallelujah and they're saying actually the one backing us up is the one you crucified the high priest had a lot of influence behind him but it was the wrong kind of influence he was an ambassador for a church system he was an ambassador for god himself and we want to be very careful that we do not become the same way i remember but remember this gospel came not in word only but in power and a demonstration of the holy ghost and much assurance hallelujah so we don't want to be like them we want to be like the first church was and we understand that the that because we're in an age of restoration that we will be and are being restored back before the church ages began that space of time before the ephesian age ever started we are being restored back to that not to the fussing and the trouble and the stewing in the churches but god dwelling in his people once again amen hallelujah amen now as i said an earthly ambassador has to go by memory has to go by memory what he's briefed on and what she's briefed on then she goes and gives that briefing but we're not the same way our king goes in us and he does the speaking he does the living he does the talking hallelujah i like that don't you he does it all um amen we just make ourselves available amen so so the apostle paul would say in ephesians 5 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones and then in first corinthians 12 and 12 4 as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether be bound or free we have all been made to drink into that spirit we are the body of christ amen by the new birth we are the we are the body of christ i mean so we're not ambassadors for a church we're not ambassadors for shekinah tabernacle that'd be the word most endearment that'd be the that'd be my worst fear as as rust be ambassadors of an earthly system right but we are ambassadors for the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah we are his body upon the earth amen he has no mouth but yours he has no ears but yours no eyes but yours no feet you but your no hands but yours no heart but yours hallelujah we are his body amen now as i said last um last sunday when when the lord made the complaint against this age and said because thou art lukewarm i'll spew the out of out of my mouth and we know that from from reading the latest in church age brother brown would say that being spewed out out of his mouth is that it's not that they are rejected as in cast out but they no longer speak for him right i mean so so we never want to get into that kind of condition where we speak for ourselves i mean jesus said it's not me it's actually the you know the father beareth witness of what i do amen so we don't want to speak for ourselves we want to speak for him and we want him to speak for himself through us amen amen now as as he had said in the church age book we are carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages before time we were in his mind we were in his sheepfold i mean we are in a sheepfold we're in his pasture but never in his mouth but what is in the mouth of the lord the word is in his mouth matthew 4 and 4 i'm just repeating this from last sunday i trust you don't mind a bit of repetition i mean but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god the word is supposed to be in our mouths too now we know that the church is his body it is here taking his place what will be the mouth of the church i mean what will be in the mouth of the church will be the word amen first peter 4 and 11 if any man speak let him speak is the oracle's the word of god second peter 1 and 21 for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they are moved by the holy ghost and we are still being moved by the holy ghost you say but i'm not a preacher but the inspiration of god can move your life hallelujah that you'll be a witness amen remember it's not about preaching a sermon we should live a sermon first amen many will never read the bible but they'll read you hallelujah amen for the prophecy came not an old time by the will of men but holy men of god spake is our move by the holy ghost then what is wrong with these people of the last day they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it i'm going to prove it to you right now he says the baptists have their creeds and dogmas based on the word and you can't shake them they say the apostolic days of miracles are over and there's no and there is no baptism with the holy ghost subsequent to believing the methodists say based on the word there is no water baptism sprinkling is not baptism and that sanctification is the baptism with the holy ghost the church of christ majors in regenerational baptism and in too many cases they go down dry sinus and come up wet ones yet they claim their doctrine is word based go right down the line and come to the pentecostals do they have the word give them the word test and see they will sell out the word for a sensation just about every time if you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and other signs whether in the word or not or whether properly interpreted from the word the majority will fall for it but what has happened to the word the word has been put aside so god says i'm gonna i'm going i am going against you all i'll spew you out of my mouth this is the end for the seven out of seven ages i've seen nothing but men esteeming their own word above mine so at the end of this age i will spew thee out of my mouth it's all over i'm going to speak all right yes i am going to be here in the midst of the church the amen of god the faithful and true witness will reveal himself and it will be by my prophet oh yes it is so amen there it is he is sending a vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2 000 years he is sending someone who will be so far from organization education in the world of religion that is john the baptist and elijah of old he will hear only from god and he will have thus saith the lord and will speak for god he will be god's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in malachi 4 and 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that last day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works hallelujah amen do you see it hallelujah i believe i'm looking at the fulfillment of that hallelujah amen he would he would make a statement as well he says he says and the people in the land he says he says when the methodists fail god raised up others and so it has gone through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age there will be a final mouthpiece upon the earth hallelujah and those people under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age they will be the final group of ambassadors upon the earth amen for a gentile bride hallelujah and we have received a messenger in this day i know this is very elementary but but we have received a messenger i mean that word that has been released has transformed us i mean it has made us new creatures in christ i remember all old things have become you know passed away everything's become new we have been transformed by the holy ghost i mean as the apostle paul would say he says the seal of my apostleship is that year in the lord that was the proof that he was a true ambassador is that the hearers of his word were in christ i mean they were in the lord they were sealed into the day of their redemption with the holy ghost and that's the seal even you say of the prophets you could say apostleship is that the bride is in the lord it's not in the church it's not in the world it's in the lord hallelujah amen that's that's first corinthians nine and uh two amen now yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god this is back in the church ages it's its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her hallelujah not just a man's voice not just a messenger's voice if i can put it that way but god's voice yes and and and that's not just us quoting scripture and quoting quotes and pushing play that's god living that's that's the people who actually have come under the messenger are now the manifestation of that message right where the bible's no longer ink on paper it's now living in a people amen and that's a true ambassador for christ is when the word puts on flesh and you and i amen then we're an ambassador for christ amen hallelujah well how long does that take just surrender everything pour it out to him pull your whole life out you become an ambassador amen this is not a 12 12 year program phd program masters program that's not that i'm glad it's not that i don't want to go back to university hallelujah amen so so the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come i mean so what the spirit saying what the bride is saying is the same thing and and that should be our hearts cry should we come during the waters of life come find rest for your weary soul you won't find any satisfaction out there come here you won't find it in religion come and come and drink of the lord jesus taste and see that the lord is good hallelujah it's more than understanding things it's more than doctrine more than explaining things it's a life it's a power of the holy ghost in our lives that's what it is hallelujah amen praise god i just say lord just pour in your holy spirit let's have more i want more of him amen there's more to have and he says once more will the church sorry once more will the word world sorry once more will the world hear directly from god as at pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as it was in the first stage he says once more the world will head direct from god as it was at pentecost what happened at pentecost they were filled they were filled with the holy ghost and god was speaking when peter was preaching that first ever sermon that wasn't peter's mind that wasn't him studying something and putting it together god just came down and spoke through him and when they were brought before the sanhedrin and thou said what name by what name or what power have you done this it says and peter was filled with the holy ghost i mean god stepped into that courtroom and began to bring an indictment against that generation holly and it's the same thing with you and i let him speak through you let him anoint your life let him be the worker on the worksite let him be the student at school i mean let him be the mother let him be the dad let him be hella be the sibling in your life hallelujah hey if it could happen for peter it could happen for us oh but i'm not in some big persecution but there's a squeeze there's a pressure in this age hallelujah but god has given us power do you think the ambassador of the united states is really intimidated by other countries do you think he really is or she is you think that he would come down to a little place that doesn't be intimidated by us oh no he knows who he is he knows who's backing him up and he knows the capability of the military right he's not afraid he's not he's not wondering i wonder if these f-35 fighters work i wonder if these cruise missiles if these atomic bombs work he knows they work he knows what their seals can do he knows what their military can do he's not afraid he's been given orders go say this and peter could stand there in front of a sanhedrin and he knew what his military can do he knows what his king does i mean he knows he just seen him do incredible things for three and a half years and then he saw him come down and fill him he saw him just raise the man from the gate beautiful he saw incredible things he knew what god could do so he wasn't intimidated hallelujah even when the apostle paul was brought before king agrippa and and he would relate the road on on on the damascus wrote the damascus experience and he says i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and and then he even said to him i believe if i get mixed up with this forgive me but but he said i i wish you were as i was except for these bonds because in reality who was the one in chains it wasn't the apostle paul it was king agrippa because he was chained by sin by unbelief he was the prisoner paul was a free man hallelujah do we know where we're standing today we're not chained by unbelief we're not chained by sin we're being made free amen who the son is set free is free indeed and we're being set free not to be dragged into bondage again but to stay free hallelujah this is this message has keeping power god will keep his bride he didn't just save her he will keep her and take her away hallelujah so god has saved you he will keep you and he's going to take you up into glory we must remember god is not mad at us god is not a dictator he's not angry at us he's not holding us over hell saying well you better line up boy or girl otherwise you're going to go there oh no no he doesn't do that he gives us assurance we know he corrects us he's a real he loves us love is corrective so if we put a foot wrong he'll correct the shore but it's not just a thrust you know many times especially i think about myself i should have been thrown in the rubbish bin a long time ago you know there comes a point where you think i just can't i'm sick of this guy put the foot on the thing the latch comes up i get thrown to you god puts the lifts his foot off the latch and the lid goes down and there i am oh lord jesus and i think i deserve it but god is in that way he's he is he is the epitome of long suffering hallelujah hallelujah why because he can't lose a part of himself hallelujah amen so once more this world will hear direct from god as at pentecost oh when brother brown was here we need him to come back and then then then the world will head direct from god to the pentecost no no no no you can't look no this is not him returning sure he will return with the dead in christ but it's all over then and we're going to go with them to meet the lord in the air but we the prophet is not coming back to to to live a life and preacher preach a message that god will you know the world will hear from god again is at pentecost no the bride is here for it amen we are in the fulfillment of revelations 10 8 to 11. take the book eat the book prophesy again this is where we are we're not sitting still we're not standing silent we're speaking of life amen we're speaking a word hallelujah you say but i'm not a preacher your life screams your life preaches your life preaches to this dying world you may just be going through pack and save your preaching you may be dropping the kids off at school you're preaching you may be at school you're preaching you may be on the work site you're preaching and you can be having a bad day and things can be going all wrong and you can be worried about all kinds of things but your life more than just these five senses more than how you're feeling but your life hallelujah because if we have the holy ghost there's an atmosphere of power around us whether we um really fathom that or not there's an atmosphere hallelujah who's ever stepped into a bad atmosphere yep you can feel it that's right but who stepped into a good atmosphere but the problem with the bad atmosphere is if you stay in it long enough you'll get used to it and it will become your new new normal well that's trending some others will say it'll become the new normal but when you step into the presence of god and you've never been in his presence before it's all this is what i've been looking for my entire life that becomes your new normal and we can even get used to what we have and what we enjoy hallelujah we should never take it for granted every time god comes down every time his word opens up every time he delivers and helps or guides we say lord i'm so thankful i'm so thankful you haven't left me here i'm not floundering around in the darkness but you are my light in the darkness hallelujah amen it's incredible what god will take us through to be his ambassador naomi was living a good life in israel she had two sons she had a husband but there's a famine there was trouble so they left and went to moab and she got to a spot in her life remember here she is she's being a living witness and even know me and and and and i can't remember her husband's name off top of my head but but the two meanings of those names mean pleasant worship so now here pleasant worship was now coming into moab and it attracted two girls one was awful one was ruth but then as this pleasant worship was going on trouble came into the house sickness came death came and now naomi's life now this is the power of her testimony this is her testimony if she could stand here and testify to you she'd say well we had a house of pleasant worship we're in moab i lost my husband i lost my sons-in-law my life came to such a bitter point where i said don't call me know me anymore i'm not pleasant my life is bitter call me mara my life has become bitter you would think that was a failure of a life let's be honest now you think that'd be a failure of a life you think she fell she backslid left the lamb because of trouble now she's failed but she had no idea that her life would impact someone that wasn't just out there she was in her home you know our children see the best and the worst of us we can put on a church face and we can you know and we can say hallelujah everything can be fine but there's trouble and they see the best and the worst of us ruth saw the best and the worst of naomi and she saw her life fall apart and not just her life but her own life fell apart because her husband died but there was something in naomi's life where ruth had to make a decision she said let your god be my god your people will be my people where you die i'm going to die i'm not going to leave you hallelujah hallelujah that was the impact she was an ambassador hallelujah you know many times we think everything will be perfect you know i feel like i can be a witness today you're not tired you're feeling good you know mental space is fine having a good time i can be a witness oh no no no that's not always that way it goes beyond your five senses and how you're feeling hallelujah but her life impacted ruth that ruth said i'm going with you let your god be my god well how did god deal with her lost her husband lost her sons now she's a better woman my life has become bitter that was her testimony about herself but something impacted ruth so much as i'm going with you hallelujah so don't beat yourself up if you're going through a hard time amen she went through a hard time years of hard time but ruth someone had to go be an ambassador to ruth because ruth had to come into the lineage of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah what's your assignment this week [Music] can we swap them no you can't swap oh i want the great place no no no where god puts us as the great place hallelujah amen so you know we are not as i said last sunday we're not going to walk out we the sign of being rapture ready is not being in a state of euphoria amen we'll be just living if you know the rapture's already in us let's just oh i'm afraid i'll miss it you can't if he if he's in you you can't miss it amen if he is in you you can't miss the rapture not just being anointed from time if he is in you his word is living in you amen you've met him like the apostle paul made him you've made him amen supernatural god now lives in a supernatural way in your life hallelujah brother brown was beyond the curtain of time before he realized he just heard a voice he was just thinking you know sing about his age and where he was and what she did more for the lord and when he says that i feel a pico millimeter big you know all seriousness you know but then he just hears a voice would you like to see pastor curtin of time he says it would help me so well and then he's taken there beyond here you know before he realizes he's there you know before we realize we'll be there in a moment a twinkling of an eye will be there oh am i gonna be ready for that moment if you've given you all and he's filled you you're ready hallelujah he was there before he realized he had been an ambassador on the earth and the place he had been an ambassador for he was taken to remember where your heart is that's where your treasures are so if your heart is in the world this is where your treasures are and this world has got an expiry date right it's already gone rotten it's falling apart i mean it has no it's got no satisfaction lasting that will ever give you i mean so if your heart is in the world this is that's the place you're an ambassador for but if your heart is in the lord if your heart is in heaven you're an ambassador for him hallelujah what are you doing laying up treasures in heaven how's your investment going real good aren't you afraid that this latest economic downturn will make you lose your investment i can't roth i mean i mean rusted moths and whatever can't can't can't touch it it can't devaluate it can't go down it can't be go negative it's good it's secure hallelujah amen so we want to be in bed and then he was there before he even realized it's amazing when when you think about when when brother brown was there and he was you know he was going through the great trial of his life and his and and and hope i think she just died or was dead and she went and spoke to he went and spoke to her and she came back to life for a bit you know a brief moment and she began to just relate a few things to him and she said it's such a wonderful place he said you know you preach so much about it but you know you know so little about it how great it really is this holy ghost just this heaven that you tell about and i think often if we could really just grasp and i pray the lord would just you know there's so many voices in this world and they can actually deafen you to the voice of god but if we could just lock in to the voice of god and realize that heaven is a far greater place than we can fathom it's a far greater place than we can ever imagine but yet we seem to know so little about it in a way sure the prophet can come back and and and he relates how it is and i believe he saw it i believe he was there i believe i'm going to but then he would when when when he would relate that uh in in one place he would sing that song you know let me look past the curtain of time and he says oh lord let them look past the curtain of time so he's not just relating now can i do it because he had been there but now he's relating lord may they look can they look past the curtain of time and i heard that and i think lord i want to look past the curtain of time i want to know what it's like over there not just mentally but just have such a taste and you know when you think about it when we gather like this and god begins to move and all the issues and the troubles of of the week have been slowly fritted away during the service now we're here to rejoice and you know and the holy spirit comes down and begins to speak to us what is that that's that future home that's heaven coming down actually giving you a look past the curtain of time maybe not with with your natural eyes right but he's moving on your heart to say there is a land beyond the river and this is you know hallelujah hallelujah you know you know when we when we cross that when we cross that chasm when this when this guy is no longer 35 18 to 21. hallelujah and we'll look kind of kind of close to how we were in that photo brothers in the back hallelujah do you know what we'll say it was worth it it was worth it it was worth it lord jesus it was worth it and then we'll see that little slave girl at neyman's house you'll say it was worth it amen and then and then naomi yeah no me will say it was worth it and ruth will say it was worth it it was worth it to leave my land and go to this place holy it was worth it hallelujah and we'll be gathered with the saints of the ages it was worth it hallelujah all christ ambassadors will feel the same way they'll never be regret i wish i could do this there was no no no no no no no worth it it was worth it hallelujah brother brown would say an adoption message 1960. he says now he says now preaching usually catches a sinner brings them under condemnation by the word but teaching places the man to do um positionally what he is what he is right amen and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are now if the united states of this fair land here sent me over to russia as an ambassador of this nation to russia then if they have officially sent me to russia all the power that's in the united states has has is behind me my word is just same as the united states if i have been recognized as an ambassador and then if god has sent us to be his ambassadors all the power that's in heaven all that god is all of his angels and all of his power stands behind our words if we are correctly and ordained sent messengers to the people god has to honor his word for he has so solemnly written whatsoever you bind on earth will i bind in heaven whatsoever you loose on earth i'll loosen heaven and i'll give unto thee the keys to the kingdom oh such great promises he's given the church you mean little old me all all of all of heaven's behind you all of heaven all the angels all that god is invested into you hallelujah he would say in confirmation of the commission 1962 that's why i believe that all who come our way calling themselves christians ambassadors sent from heaven they should have a confirmation of their commission i believe there should be a confirmation of their commission now we realize that jesus said here in marks the 16th chapter that all that he sent out on commission will bear the confirmation these signs shall follow them that believe now he didn't say they may be they'll follow or they ought to follow they will follow hallelujah amen amen hallelujah the bride is the mouthpiece of god in this day amen well how could you say that god is in his word but if the words are new if the words are new not your opinion but if the words are new amen brother brown would say in the church age book and i was real tempted to put up pictures of dissected frogs and who's ever dissected anything i i kind of went around biology at school and i ended up doing biochemistry at uni but it was not from the biology anyway yeah i was going to put some you just googled maybe okay parents google dissection first but you know i was going to put something up i thought you know there's these frogs and their guts are out and their brains and you know because it's been pulled apart analyzed what's here this is the heart this is the liver there's the kidney and you know but but brother and says now he has cried out to this last age you have the word you have more bibles than ever but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces that when i read that word dividing i thought dissecting and then when hacking it to pieces i remember when i was a about 10 who's 10 here 10 11 12. so all my friends farm up the east coast here in gisborne most beautiful place in the world in new zealand i'd say but otherwise you can say men back me up a little bit there we go i know the south island's nice too but you know you know we would we would get the get the meat for the farm dogs and there was a little stump and we had a little hatchet and we get these bits of meat and hack it to pieces and then divvy it out we don't want to why are you saying that we don't want to hack the word to pieces just chop it just haphazardly there's a nurse and then even even dissect it it's good to examine the word so i'm saying study the word but don't take pits bits you like in bits you don't like you know you can dissect things so finally you can take veins out and and capillaries and different things and you know you can dissect real fine things out of an animal we don't want to finally do that to the word of god amen taking what you want and leaving what you don't want he says you're not interested in living it but debating it what's a debate you get your facts and you present your facts this is my position i remember high school first high school i went to somehow i ended up on the debating team you know just i don't know why but there i was and yeah you find yourself in places how did i get here i don't know and i'm still asking that question today but anyway you know but but you know so so you'd have a for and against and this is the topic and it was just a debate but christianity is not a debate it's a life it's a life hallelujah it's not a debate he says odd sooner you were hot or cold if you were cold and rejected i could stand that if you were white hot as to know it's truth and live it who knows it's truth who lives it too lord live it in through me hallelujah i would praise you for it but when you simply take my word and don't honor it i in return must refuse to honor you i'll spew thee out of um spewing out for you nauseate me now that's from the church age book all that now to honor something means to hold it in high respect or great esteem it's the quality of knowing and doing what is morally right so to respect something or sorry to honor it you gotta hold it in high respect and great esteem who's got the pearl of great price who's got the pearl of great price who's actually realized this is a pearl of great price this word and you hold it up and you look and you sell all you give everything else all of your life whatever you used to do sell it take it to cash converters get rid of it because i've got the real pearl the pearl of great price if you really recognize that and and i believe i'm looking at people who do that then you will then you will honor it hallelujah i believe i'm looking at people that that love the lord more than their own lives amen hallelujah and we are interested in living it not debating it we're not interested in dividing and hacking it into pieces the word we want the whole thing we want all of the lord jesus i did not marry just his arm who's ever been to a wedding in the and and the bride marries an arm or a leg or the head or the nose or part of the groom no that's not a marriage that's weird right there's something real weird going on but unfortunately that's how christians do they will take part of the word they'll take the arm oh i'm saved by grace but they don't know what grace is and they just use an excuse look i've i'm married or they just take the finger or the toe or whatever they just take part of the word we want the whole word the whole lamb all the god is i want i have it tears bits off my back because you know i've got to go through deep things and god's gonna you know rearrange my life in a very you know big way so be it amen hallelujah but we want the whole world we don't want to just take part of the message take the whole thing amen we are his ambassadors all of heaven is behind us now if the voice of god is in the bride i'm just going to kind of there's something called time it keeps moving anyway jesus would say in john 14 and 12 and brother brown would would relate this scripture all the way through his ministry he says verily verily i send you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than they shall he do because i go unto my father and he didn't just put that scripture on himself that was for the believer because jesus says he that believeth on me hallelujah amen so so he that believeth on me the works that i do he shall do also this is the sign that they are my ambassador hallelujah so let's examine very quickly what now did the church do they didn't just sit in the upper room they burst it out of that place they see jesus lives he's in me now they burst it out there and begin to tell the world we need wisdom to do it but you know there's a spirit in the world and don't be shocked by this statement i know you're all sitting down which is good but there's a spirit in the world that wants us to stop being a witness yes sir right that's why you sometimes yo sometimes you feel led not to say anything but sometimes it's just a pressure actually don't say anything so give us wisdom lord what's the worst thing that can happen hallelujah well actually the worst thing that could happen is you just go to heaven quicker than other people well that's what happened to the apostles do you think they regretted it do you think they would have done it all again do you think the apostle paul was saying i don't want to you know no i've run the race i fought the fight i've kept the faith now crown of life is laying up for me hallelujah you know when i when i was um learning how to sail a boat when i was who's ten again around there nine ten you know you come to a realisation the worst thing can happen is you just get wet hey the boat can do some assaults you could swim after it you know things can happen but the worst thing is you just get wet what is there to fear about it just get your sea legs and get in the thing and it can be the same thing being a witness yes lord lead us in doing so right but what's the worst thing oh the conversation's just shut down that's all right just move on you know maybe just put a little bit in next day not a little bit and maybe just leave it for a little bit and talk about something else oh lord help us i'm preaching to myself too amen so in the early church they cast the devil out they didn't put up with him they cast the devil out and my name thou shall cast out devils amen so a principle work of the church is casting out of satan right that is a principle work of the church it's not to put up with him are they just going through you know brother brown would talk about his daughter rebecca and and and and the trials she was going through she was living in pressure she was the prophet's daughter he wasn't well liked and she had to live with this kind of thing and but but yet go out to school and you know but there was this thing hanging over and she got so mad saying you just want me to be a wall flower all my life and dinner you know because you want to go play piano your rock and roll music on the piano and stuff and whatever more and probably because the reason she did that is because that teacher thought she was good so now oh there's a person that likes me there's no stigma here are you following amen but then but then so so she just blew up at her parents at her dad and then one hand brother brandon said well that's just her going through that time but then on the other hand she said well he said well that's actually the devil and it was just like a tantrum we have to be well then and then he said i felt like taking my belt off and running after her but then he realized no no no we're gonna be here we're gonna commit it to god hallelujah pray for her and be her buddy amen so we're going to look at you know the problem is the older someone gets the more refined their tantrum can be i know i've preached on the effects of tantrums and you know but but you know like a little kid oh boy you know they're having a tantrum but an adult maybe their eye just twitches a little bit and you know something's going on and they're planning something [Music] uh that's not an experience by the way so you know but you know but you know it can be a very refined tantrum ultra him i'll show her oh boy lord jesus help us you know i like how the prophet says we are failures to begin with we are not perfect people and i'll i'll just say for myself i'm not a perfect we're we are work in progress how do you know construction is done when the body's changed hallelujah but even being under construction god sends us forth as an ambassador hallelujah well i've got to become perfect then i can become a witness well you're not going to be a witness we're perfect in christ we're sinlessly perfect right by his blood but uh maturity perfection we are ongoing amen now i don't know how i got into that but here i am so the principal work of the church or a principal work of the church is the cast out the devil lord give us wisdom how to do it don't put up with it get rid of it but god give us wisdom how to do it you know it's amazing brother brown would um he would uh you know a couple would no i think it's just a wife or a husband would yeah husband would would come to him brother bram help me my marriage is falling apart you know i believe this but my wife believes something else and you know she came in and i just cast the devil out of her in the name of jesus christ and began to pray and call on god and now the whole things just blow up and um yeah and he said no that's not how you cast a devil out what what a what a imagine that honey i'm home safe didn't get out of here the never jesus i'm not but that's what some people do i'm going to cast it no he says actually love cast the devil out and there's actually the vice versa where a woman comes to the comes to brother brown says my husband doesn't believe this and our family's falling apart and we're so separated and what should i do and i've tried to cast the devil out of him but but nothing's working he's just pushing him the other way and and and and then brother bam says well what's his favorite pie and she's probably thinking what why what what's this got to do with dessert this is serious and he's giving a serious answer what's his favorite pie well cherry or what know what it is but you know you all know the story i trust so make him the favorite pie give it to him when he comes home sit up on his lap and give him a big hug and a kiss and all these things and the devil was cast out [Music] amen thank you lord jesus give us wisdom that's the prophet of the age giving marriage counseling love goes a long way it's not a well i'll do this you do this that's not love no love just goes a long way amen so the principle work of the church is to cast out the devil now i'm gonna i'm gonna kind of not be not be too much further with this amen so brother abraham says in the church age book he says let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of revelation of jesus christ in the church he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not the devil knows that amen he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 of the theologians he knows that since god is immutable in his nature then he's just as immutable in his way so he doesn't change his nature doesn't change what he was in moses day same what he was before the foundation of the world same today and his ways are the same thus satan knows assuredly that the original church of pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be but now remember this christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works which are the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for do we know who we are and what we stand for amen and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he'll be as definitely thraltered today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them hallelujah it's amazing brother makes a statement because people think i can't speak i'm not talented in any way i can't sing i can't dance i can't play an instrument i can't preach but brother and says there are paid preachers and paid assistants paid ministers of music and education paid choirs paid custodians programs and entertainment all grading all costing great sums but for all that the power is is decreasing speaking of the church yes the church is rich but the power is not there god moves by his spirit not by the amount of money or talent in the church he said i can't sing but you can sing in such a way that god can come down hallelujah i can't hold a tune don't matter amen i'm not qualified moses would give the same excuses and god just got annoyed at him you're my ambassador moses i can't speak so don't feel sorry for what you view as being in insignificant you know if we believed we had it all together god just wouldn't use us remember a sheep always needs a shepherd doesn't matter how old how young that sheep is how long it's been in the herd how big its horns are whatever it needs a shepherd we always need a shepherd to guide us hallelujah well i'm insufficient that's a good place to be brother braham says i think i um i think it's in um i can't remember what service but he says that we must conquer the thought of human ability we must actually conquer that thought that we are able to do it that's what he's saying that's him that does it amen now intercession i'm just going to go through listen this point and then we'll be done okay i'm about to close everyone wakes up intercession the bride has a power of intercession right our prayers can change the world oh you mean the whole globe maybe not the whole globe but one person one person amen it can change the economics of one country for one soul to come out hallelujah yeah it's amazing the devil puts up the iron curtain to stop the gospel going in and stopping the jews coming out he couldn't do it i mean the bamboo curtain went up trying to stop the gospel going in couldn't do it amen the message has gone in the bride's been called out hallelujah amen he puts up education he puts up all things to try and stop the bribe being called out of a place he came too late amen but we have remember god hears our prayer who believes god hears us when we pray who believes amen so if if we believe he hears us when we pray then our words have power with god amen hallelujah amen so we have power to to intercede even as jesus would say simon simon behold satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that they that thy fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren so peter was in a dangerous position he was a believer but he hadn't received the holy ghost yet he hadn't been converted but jesus knew that the devil was trying to destroy him but he says i have prayed for you that you won't fail amen i believe we can do the same for one another it's important to lift one another in prayer you say well i don't know what to pray for here i am this is about three hours prayer right here i can't think of what to pray for pray for someone else or i need the lord to move in my life pray for someone else and then god will move on your behalf now aaron was an incredible man it's amazing what god can do with a person aaron would would would be uh moses god said that moses was a god to the people and aaron was his prophet he would raise the rod and he would do different things and miracles would happen but he came to a spot in his life that that he would make a golden car for the people they had been called out in an exodus they were there waiting for the word to come down the mountain but pressure got put on him by the people and he made that golden calf now did this change now now my question is did this change god's mind about aaron being the high priest so the same one that made this golden calf was the same one that would go into the holy of holies with the blood on behalf of the people and then even aaron would be told when you know this is a number 16 and moses said unto aaron because a plague had broken out upon the people he says take a censor and put fire there in from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly into the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath going out from the lord the plague has begun and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun upon the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed well what's incense in the bible prayer but he was instructed take the censer take the incense run into the midst of the people stand between the living and the dead make an atonement for them hallelujah and if aaron didn't do it the plague would have continued on but because aaron did that as he is instructed by the word amen the plague was stayed what's that got to do with me there's a plague of unbelief striking this world it's far worse than covert 19 far worse than cancer far worse than the flu as that spirit of ladies here of unbelief that's gripped the world so the plague has begun but we can as moses did i mean as aaron did stand between the living and the dead and make and be and be an intercessory for for people amen that that plague doesn't strike them and if it struck them they get delivered of it amen hallelujah so we do you know who you are i'm just a message believer i'm the bride of christ i've been invested with authority just like a policeman he'd be you know he can be the smallest policeman in the whole world go out there in front of these big trucks he holds up his badge that truck's got to stop hallelujah why because all of the police forces behind that man and it's the same thing with us we can we can be the smallest believer in the world amen but we have the badge of believer hallelujah and all of all of heaven is is behind that badge hallelujah so aaron would run and he would make an atonement for the people and he would stand between the dead and the living hallelujah and we can do the same thing and it's actually part of our commission stand between the dead and the living make an atonement for them as and pray and deceit for them that god will work on their behalf and he was the one who made the golden calf i've done a lot of bad things in my life he made a golden calf didn't change god's mind about him amen so we have the right to intercede you know brother brown would would speak about the evidence of the holy ghost and we know he says as many things we know it's the fruit of the spirit we know it's receiving the word for your day but he would go to ezekiel 9 and he would relate to those that signed cry for the abominations done in the city and he would actually say now that's an evidence of the holy ghost now i know that's a pretty big thing to swallow sometimes because we get conditioned to live in this world we get used to living this way with the sin that's out there but he said how many people were actually sighing cry for the abominations down the city but yet be full of joy and rejoicing at the same time so i'm not saying we should be incumbent down the world so bad the world's so bad but we should have a burden amen that this there's so much evil on the streets today spirits running rampant shouldn't we be built in such a way to actually not be used to it we shouldn't be adjusted to living in this world now that doesn't mean we go be a monk in some monastery somewhere we have to live in this world but sin should actually bother us sin should bother us iniquity should bother us i mean help people it's not member you know there's a saying love the sinner but hate the sin absolutely but there has to be a time where we actually try and pluck them from the fire we should have a burden if we really love people and and i'm preaching very much to myself right now if we really love people we should have a burden for them lord save them help them open their eyes lord deliver them lord there's so much sin down in the city there's so much wickedness done your brother brown would say how many abortions were done in chicago last night or whatever more how many people were killed basically murder state sanctioned murder how many were done and and then and then he'd look about phoenix and so on he said is it better now or was it better when the indians first came through their score and squad whatever it was called you know they they just came through and the coyotes drunk out the river and was it better then or is it better now all the sin is being done but we we live in this world we need to be able to see the difference between right and wrong right we we must oh but people will think that that that i'm judging them i'll just say this they'll be judged one day whether you like it or not and how we approach people shouldn't be a whole bunch of condescending way they should actually want what we have amen and we should live in such a way that people should know that we are not afraid to talk about our lord amen help us lord jesus but we want to be his ambassadors he says those that sight and cry for the abomination abominations done in the city they were they had the seal of god in their foreheads they were sealed in their foreheads we should never be accustomed now i trust this is the right way sometimes i say things and i cringe for the next week i said i said that law like this but you know we shouldn't be adjusted to this world right sure it's evil it's meant to be an evil age but it's the greatest age as well at the same time but we should never say well that's just how people should be people shouldn't be as they are here you know people should be believers walking with god that's actually what we're made to do we're not made to be following sin and be chained by the devil we'll actually be made to walk free with the lord jesus that's how man is actually built to be you know imagine what it'd be like if everyone just be well be the millennium wouldn't it be incredible if every man woman and child become a believer god just you know but we should be you know i i pray you know don't be discouraged and well doing well i'm just plowing along and it doesn't seem like anything's happening ruth came in because of naomi i mean that little slave girl was in neyman's house just for that one bit and she was an ambassador she was a faithful and true witness amen who wants to be a faithful and true witness hallelujah the disciples ran their race the believers through the ages ran their race what about you and i amen let's have the musicians you know you know come this morning please we'll just we'll just leave it there but let's not lose our enthusiasm for the lord let's not be adjusted to this world it works yes so i don't see the result it's on its way it's on its way abraham prayed 25 years isaac was coming and isaac arrived hallelujah hey miller stan shall we i want to sing that song i know who's going to help me in the morning when i rise give me jesus amen do we have that song
